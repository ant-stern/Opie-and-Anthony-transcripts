<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts embracing their "satellite radio douchebag" status and reminiscing about past radio promotions, including the "WOW" campaign involving female breast exposure and the legal limitations they faced.  They then transitioned to a discussion of Braylon Edwards' DUI, jokingly suggesting higher acceptable BAC levels.  Jimmy detailed a recent sunburn, an upcoming weekend at Opie's poolside "compound," and an embarrassing celebrity encounter at the *Bored to Death* premiere, where his attempts to secure photos with actors like Jamie Hector and Ted Danson were hampered by his awkward social skills.  This led to a broader discussion of Jimmy's photo obsession, his struggles with small talk, and a past radio segment where he received significant criticism. The segment concluded with a frank discussion of Jimmy's relationship problems, his arguments with his girlfriend, their communication styles, and his desire to improve conflict resolution.

The next segment focused on relationship dynamics, sparked by Opie's red-carpet experience where his girlfriend felt dismissed.  The hosts debated communication styles, Opie's tendency to diffuse conflict, and the consequences of this approach.  Caller Greg highlighted the irony of a divorced man (Opie) giving relationship advice, leading to a discussion of Opie's past relationship struggles.  Frequent caller Megan, known for a previous call about an underwater hotel, joined the conversation, discussing her son Grady, Opie's intellect, stress hormones released during arguments, her job as a high school teacher, and the consequences of teacher-student relationships.  Further calls explored relationship conflicts and coping mechanisms.  The conversation then shifted to pop culture, including Archie comics' political commentary (with a crude joke), Vinny from *Jersey Shore*'s low Playgirl offer, and Opie's graphic description of his bowel movements following *Biggest Loser*-inspired dieting, contrasting his experience with those who don't suffer similar digestive consequences after overeating.  The segment concluded with a discussion of *Dancing with the Stars*,  David Hasselhoff's elimination, Bristol Palin's appearance, and varying opinions on her attractiveness, along with a final caller's perspective on relationships and Hasselhoff's elimination.  Kenny also shared an incident where his dog ingested poison.

The following segment heavily featured NFL player conduct controversies, specifically Braylon Edwards' DUI and Michael Vick's return after his dogfighting conviction, with callers expressing strongly opposing viewpoints.  The hosts also heavily criticized the Nassau Coliseum and the presentation of Islanders games.  A caller mentioned Mel Tillis's upcoming comedy album.  A significant portion focused on the documentary *King of Kong*, the rivalry between Billy Mitchell and Steve Wiebe, and the eccentric Robert Mirzak, the official scorer.  Several callers contributed to the discussion, including Eddie (Braylon Edwards), Scott (Michael Vick), Rich (NFL culture), Jim (Nassau Coliseum), David (unexpected historical comment), and Matt (Robert Mirzak's business). Bob Kelly was mentioned as a future guest, and the hosts briefly discussed their experience on Louis C.K.'s show.

The next segment centered on the intense dislike the hosts held for Billy Mitchell, using vulgar language to describe him and his Donkey Kong record.  The conversation included a caller's negative experience at a restaurant allegedly owned by Mitchell, Eastside Dave's obscene voicemails for Mitchell, mockery of a Ray J. Johnson song, a debate about prosthetic breasts in *Eastbound and Down*, promotion of Bob Kelly's stand-up shows (with a vulgar phone number), a brief rap performance by Bobby K, and anticipation for a call from Danny McBride. The segment was characterized by chaotic banter, frequent interruptions, offensive language, and numerous tangents.

The final segment focused on the graphic rape scene in *The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo*, with explicit descriptions and reactions from the hosts and guests.  The discussion shifted to the film's remake and the potential impact of political correctness.  The arrival of Colin Quinn sparked a series of insulting, comedic exchanges with the hosts, touching on Quinn's Broadway show and a past interaction with Jerry Seinfeld.  A humorous bit involving Jim Norton and a banana led to Norton being mocked. The show concluded with goodbyes and promotions, notable moments included Jim Norton being bitten by Colin Quinn and a discussion about female body hair preferences.  Both Robert Kelly and Colin Quinn were in studio for this portion.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Shut up!  Get us back to the funny.  But first, let's play this.  People understand we don't belong in radio, right?  Satellite radio douchebags?  I take that as like a compliment.  Yes, we suck a dick.  Sorry to everybody out there.  This is fucking satellite fuck dick radio. 
[00:00:30]  Holy shit.  What a great show.  We heard you.  I don't want to make everyone feel bad,  but you know this is what old people sit around and do.  B-porn, semen squirting, and shoot up the job.  Oh, what the fuck?  This morning has been, I feel like I'm on Jerry Springer.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning.  Whip him out Wednesday, that old gag.  Is it?  What the fuck happened to Whip him out Wednesday? 
[00:01:00]  Greatest radio promotion.  Who's whipping out what?  I saw WOW stickers, though, on the way home yesterday.  Oh, they're all over the place, and people are just wandering around going,  what the fuck does this do?  What is a WOW?  Girls pull their tits out.  Their titty tits.  Their titty tits.  Their teats.  Their titty tits.  Fucking WOW.  We gotta get that going again, huh?  I know, right?  Are we allowed to do WOW still?  I don't even know.  It was huge.  Have they shut that down yet? 
[00:01:30]  You know, the lawyers.  The lawyers.  Well, they say it's a hazard, and we shouldn't do it in bloody...  The lawyers are saying...  Shut it.  Shut it.  Shut it.  Shut it.  Let us be radio stars, and you be whatever you are.  You defend what we do.  We're radio stars, and you're big disappointments to your parents.  That's what they used to do.  We'd do what we do, and they would defend it.  Now they come back and say, don't even try it!  Right.  I'm fucking pissed off right now, I'll tell you that much. 
[00:02:00]  What happened?  Being a big Jets fan.  J-E-T-S, Jets, Jets, Jets.  I'm not pissed off that Braylon Edwards blew a .16.  I don't give a shit.  I'm a little disappointed.  I thought he said double the legal limit.  Yeah.  Is that it?  .08, right?  Oh, is it?  Yeah, they dropped it, so he's double the legal limit at .16.  Dude, I consider two. 
[00:02:30]  He missed his number by .01.  I'm going back old school when one was fucking legal.  So I'm saying, unless you blow a two, you're a pussy.  .16 is pretty impressive, my friend.  Pretty impressive.  Yeah, it is.  Pretty impressive.  Danny, how many times did you blow a fucking 1.6 at the house?  At the house?  That's when I got my own D-Wee, I blew a 1.6.  Oh, you got a D-Wee?  A while ago, yeah.  Danny had one a while back.  It was almost 10 years ago, already.  We have a breathalyzer at the compound. 
[00:03:00]  I wouldn't know.  So you got to come over and check it out.  Oh, really?  Yeah, you blow into it, and it shows what the fucking blood alcohol level is.  I might impress you fuckers.  Go old school and do a little drinking.  Oh, fuck.  That'd be mint.  Yeah, I wouldn't mind that.  By the way, good weekend this weekend.  Nothing going on.  Let me tell you something, Opie.  I'm going to be cordially invited over the compound this weekend.  What day?  Saturday, Sunday, both days.  Really?  We're hanging. 
[00:03:30]  Really?  It's going to be a nice weekend.  Really?  Pool, heated.  I actually had to fix the heat sensor.  It went up to 123 degrees and started beeping an alarm.  I think Lipa came to my house and said, what the fuck are you doing?  Jesus.  But it was a sensor problem.  I hit it with a hammer, and it went back down to 93 where it belonged.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah, yeah.  But then I was hanging out outside, and you noticed my color here on my face.  Well, no.  I'm on the left side of your body right now, so I don't notice it. 
[00:04:00]  Jimmy, who's on the right side of your body, will notice.  See, Jim?  Half his face is beet red.  Wow.  I look like Close Encounters, like a Dreyfuss when he looked out the window at the UFO.  I'm a 50-50 bar.  I was going to say an ass, but...  What happened was I went home.  What a beautiful day yesterday, by the way.  Sunny, just warm.  So I decided, you know what?  I'm going to put some shorts on.  I'm going out to my Chase Lounge.  I set it out right in the sun. 
[00:04:30]  It was about noon-ish.  I laid down.  I had some bottled water.  I put the music on.  I laid down and crashed out.  That was at noon.  2.30, I stir.  I wake up, and I notice I'm on my side, like in the fetal position, with the sun beating on one side of my body.  That's wonderful.  And I woke up, looked at my watch, and went, oh, fuck, I've been out here for two and a half hours.  I walked in, looked in the mirror, and went, okay, I'm going to be made fun of tomorrow. 
[00:05:00]  There's no getting out of it.  You're Italian.  You shouldn't be burning like that.  No, you know what it is?  I'm very tan this year, by the way.  Very tan.  Your face is beet red.  Yeah, the one side.  But it'll go away by, like, tomorrow.  Except for the skin cancer.  It's hard to tell, though, because you're dark-skinned anyway.  I can't really tell how much of a difference.  You can't tell.  Take your hat off.  Well, the moors.  There's a shadow.  The moors.  See, look, there's a shadow.  Oh, yeah.  He's beet red.  Yeah, yeah.  Halfway down his face.  Give it a good slap. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  I'll agree with that, babe.  No, no.  Look, it doesn't hurt.  What's my dick on that?  Oh, you fucking ass.  Now I can see it.  I have a sunburn on my tongue, Jimmy.  Would you help me out?  Oh, boy.  That's a joke in a minute.  Put a gay one, too.  Yeah, I'll check it off the fucking list.  Yes.  You want to do Godfather now or later?  What do you want to do?  Shining, I got penciled in for 9 o'clock, so we're good there.  They put a dick in Sonny's mouth at the causeway.  There you go.  There.  Godfather's done.  Well, my brother coming out with something more than a dick in his mouth. 
[00:06:00]  There you go.  You lack dicks, Doc.  All right.  We got the shining all set.  We got it.  That's done.  Let's just get them all out of the way.  Let's get a fat dick like E-Rock.  I'll check that out.  All right.  That's done.  E-Rock is a dick and a fat fuck.  Or a black dick, a stolen one.  The racism out of the way.  We get it.  Travis is a faggot.  Yes, he is.  We got that.  He did his racism at 540.  Trust me.  I did it before the show started.  Oh, darn.  Oh, my God.  Because someone had the unfortunate luck to talk about the moon on TV. 
[00:06:30]  Holy shit.  Yes.  The moon?  I threw the word cricket in somewhere.  Of course you would.  Why wouldn't I?  What happened?  We were talking about Braylon Edwards.  You all right?  Yes.  Are you all right?  Yeah.  All right.  Are you Dewey right now?  Because we were talking about Braylon Edwards, and then I don't know what happened.  The car went off the road.  We just talk about stuff.  The car went off the road.  No, I don't think I am.  Do we have you a breathalyzer?  I'll take one right now.  We'll see what we got.  Really?  Yeah, why not?  Do we got one? 
[00:07:00]  I'll blow one now.  All right.  Jimmy?  I was born with a breathalyzer.  What you do is you gently tug the sack.  You're accurate reading.  Holy hooly.  I went to the premiere of Bored to Death last night.  Right.  It's a fucking great show.  I've never seen it before.  But you're in it.  I haven't won an episode.  They didn't show my episode because I'm later.  I heard they did.  I heard they showed a piece of you last night.  Somebody tweeted that.  No.  No, no, no.  Maybe they're talking about the...  The premiere on HBO.  Maybe they're talking about the commercial that's running for it.  Yeah, yeah.  I've never seen the show. 
[00:07:30]  I just...  I was...  It's a fucking funny show.  Dude, you're...  Is it a Carleese one-man show?  Bored to Death.  Yes, gone, but...  We get it.  I'm what?  No, someone was saying they saw you in Bored to Death, but I think it might be the commercial  that run...  The preview.  I slap him.  You're on a loop on demand.  Yeah.  You know that, right?  Nice.  They're showing you just over and over again.  Oh, yeah.  When I...  There's a scene where I slap him.  Right.  And I was downstairs.  It's really... 
[00:08:00]  They're all fucking nice people.  And I'm downstairs.  And fuck, I'm talking to Gaffigan.  And he goes, yeah, one of the guys from The Wire was right in front of me while we were  watching.  I'm like, who?  It immediately changed my demeanor.  Sure.  Oh, yeah.  And he's like, that guy Marlo?  That guy Marlo?  Holy shit.  I fucking ran over people.  I was talking to the star of the show, what the guy was the show's based on.  He's like, we'd love to have you back next year.  You were really...  You hit it out of the park.  I'm like, oh, thank you.  Thank you.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Goodbye.  Is that the picture, though, that you got?  Yeah.  On Twitter?  I saw that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:08:30]  You're part of those guys now.  Stop it.  It's amazing.  Oh, look at that.  That's great.  But, I mean, you're running past stars of the show you're on.  I'm the worst, dude.  I'm a child.  And Marlo was like, so what are you doing?  Are you going to the party after?  I'm like, dude, you were so great.  You're in their league now, Jimmy.  You're an equal.  I can't talk to somebody.  What's wrong with you?  Look at this.  Look at Jimmy's smile.  That's Marlo, all right.  That's fucking Jamie Hector.  Marlo's just like, what is Marlo doing?  I don't know, but I couldn't believe it.  That's cool.  I saw him out there. 
[00:09:00]  I'm like, Jamie Hector.  And he just looked and smiled.  I'm like, Jamie Hector.  No, you call him Marlo.  That's Marlo.  Oh, man.  Until he does something important.  He's been in some of those stuff.  But those guys are probably used to it.  Heroes.  He's in Heroes.  I never want to hear you talk about the smile I had with Chris Cornell after that.  Look at the goofy, smiley, happy Jimmy look on your face.  It really is humiliating, though.  Because I can't.  Like, there was an after party.  Like, after the thing.  He's like, so you go into the thing. 
[00:09:30]  And I just couldn't say, yeah, maybe I'll see.  I almost went and bought a wire and then went to the party.  Oh, no.  But I didn't do it.  Could you sign this?  I didn't do it.  I knew if I went to the party, I would just talk to him about the wire and annoy him all  night.  Did you hear about Friday Show when you were in L.A.?  Oh, my God.  We gave you a beating.  Oh, I heard it.  Oh, did you get a beating?  I heard I got a good tippy.  I'm even scared to bring up the fact that we gave you a beating.  Was it about Bill Ward to get my picture?  Oh, it was everything.  You got a sound thrash. 
[00:10:00]  It was everything.  You might want E-Rock to give you a copy of that show.  It was a lot of fun.  It's all right.  I deserve it.  Everything.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're putting together a special of just everyone being thrown under the bus.  Okay.  Who was in?  Florentine?  Yeah.  Florentine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kenny got involved.  It was ugly.  Oh, no.  What did Kenny say?  Nothing.  I don't even want to bring it up.  I have to know what Kenny said.  You got a sound beating.  That's all I'm going to say.  Which wasn't fair because you weren't here. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  That's why I braced it up.  About your place.  And I kind of brought up things I heard about Ange and Keith when they came over your house.  Oh, that was all like pictures?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just, you know.  Your obsession with slobbing photos.  Kissing over your bed.  I don't know what it is, dude.  I really don't know why I like that.  I was embarrassed last night.  I'm like, because Ted Danson is right there.  Ted Danson?  I had scenes with him, and I just walked by.  Like, he was talking to somebody, and he didn't see me, so I didn't even tap him. 
[00:11:00]  I go, Ted.  I don't feel like I fit in with anybody.  He touched his arm.  Ted.  Dude, I could have just said, hey, Ted, good to see you.  He would have said hi.  Were other people getting pictures?  What?  Were other people getting pictures?  Or are you the only one running around getting pictures?  I was outside when I got it.  I wouldn't know.  Honestly, it's fine there.  Nobody cares.  It's very relaxed.  Yeah.  You see a flash.  You just see Jimmy behind it.  But with him, you know, I didn't give a fuck.  I literally would have stood up in the screening and done it.  I'm just wondering if Ted Danson's running around with a camera getting photos.  No. 
[00:11:30]  This is why I hate myself.  Is Marlo running around getting photos?  No.  Nobody is.  No.  Nobody is.  Jimmy was getting photos.  You're running over, like, other celebrities to get celebrities you don't have pictures  with yet.  It's insane.  Oh, God.  It was, uh, it's fucking embarrassing, dude.  Like, on the set, because the guy I did the scenes with was Herc from The Wire.  So, uh, Ted Danson, they are, let me tell you something.  With The Wire guys, everybody in the business is, uh, kind of, uh, treats those guys with 
[00:12:00]  reverence.  Those guys get a lot of respect.  I don't care who the guy is.  Because they got no respect from the, uh, academy, from the critics, from anything.  But anybody in the business loves them.  Yeah, yeah.  Everyone knows that rule.  They care what their peers think.  They really are.  They're royalty to their peers.  It's really a weird thing The Wire guys have.  It's one of the greatest shows ever, man.  And, and, and, like, Danson knows, like, he knows Cheers was a great show, but he's  like, you know, it's like, this is The Wire.  It's just, it's a different vibe.  So he was talking to the guy, did you see Ted Danson's plane? 
[00:12:30]  No, does he have one?  Oh, Ted Danson's plane.  I didn't know he had one.  Seinfeld.  Oh.  Wow, that's wonderful.  I'm so stupid.  That's wonderful.  I'm so gullible.  That's wonderful.  I'm so glad you stopped the story for that.  That's okay.  I'm so gullible.  I should have known that.  I'm like, really?  Everyone gets it.  Then Jimmy's questioning it.  I'm like, Jimmy, really?  I didn't know.  You're in the middle of Manhattan.  Ted Danson's plane is parked on what?  Park Avenue?  Hey, look, it could have been Chip.  Yeah.  Yeah, I got a plane, too.  I also got a simple, a plain and simple, you know? 
[00:13:00]  Oh, Chip.  Anyway.  Oh, shit.  I just fucking lost.  Oh, okay.  Never mind.  So I just can't talk to them.  Oh, but he was talking to Mike Lombardozzi about how much he loved The Wire.  But he was just talking to him peer to peer.  He's like, that show is so...  He was just raving about how great...  But he didn't ask for photos.  He just...  Put you on the other hand.  Hi.  Can I get a picture?  Take care.  I don't know if they want to talk to me or not.  I just leave.  I'm done.  Really?  You don't even stick around after the picture's taken? 
[00:13:30]  Because that's all you care about is getting the picture.  I'm ashamed.  He was asking me if I was going to the party.  He was like, what are you doing?  Do you know how to, like, have a conversation with people that are...  Do you have a picture, Anthony?  Okay.  That's it, isn't it?  Is that about...  Is that it?  That's about it, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It is hard.  Do you know your place in entertainment?  Yes.  You're right here.  Under a rock.  Exactly.  There's the New York Comedy Festival I'm not involved with.  I do know my place.  That's the problem. 
[00:14:00]  You're moving up quickly, sir.  I'm moving up from fucking Moe Hill to Ant Hill.  You're on Leno.  Exactly.  Jay, I have a picture with Jay.  I got it in 2004.  It's not always about pictures.  Is it going to drive you nuts to put down the camera one day?  I don't think I ever will.  You're going to get to that place, though.  Like, Ted Danson can't pull out a camera and start getting pictures with celebrities.  No, he can, but it's not...  You know, I mean, you've got a ways to go before Ted Danson, because now the Ted Danson  fans are going to blah, blah, blah.  But you know what I'm trying to say.  Ted Danson can, because they'll be thrilled to take one with him. 
[00:14:30]  What he'll do is, he won't say, can I have a picture with you?  What he would say is, let's take a picture together.  Right.  And no one would refuse it.  It's acceptable on that level.  Like, hey, I admire you.  Let's do something fun.  So you're not at that point yet?  No, I'm this guy.  You're not at that point.  He's showing his picture now with the guy from The Wire.  I smile and give him a politician's handshake while he's just like, what are we doing?  And then run away to see who else is in the room.  You might need a picture with him.  No, with him, I didn't care.  I literally, because Michael K. 
[00:15:00]  Omar was supposed to be there.  All of a sudden, I'm thinking, God, if I get both of them together, it'd be the greatest  picture ever.  Yeah.  But it didn't happen.  I don't know why.  So you think more about the picture than the actual kind of conversation or relationship.  I don't feel like...  I have...  I feel like...  I just...  I'm starstruck.  I don't know what to say.  You've never had a conversation...  Like, just the conversation with these guys.  Yeah, I have after a while.  When they're on the air, it's different.  But it's meaningless.  I don't mean on the air.  I mean just hanging out.  It's hard.  I'm not saying it's easy. 
[00:15:30]  It's hard to drum up some kind of a common ground.  If I'm working with somebody...  Like, when I worked with Michael, I worked talking to him the whole time.  We hung out in the trailer.  He just came and knocked it on my trailer.  But there's your common ground.  I'm talking...  You're at a party.  You meet somebody.  How do you continue the conversation without it turning into...  Can I get a picture?  I'm a fan.  Just talking about, like, life.  Tough, right?  Yeah, I really don't do it.  I mean, I've done it with guys. 
[00:16:00]  But, uh...  It's like, look, they have no interest in me either.  Like, I don't need to...  Do you think, or are you just being...  No, they don't.  Why would they?  You're just self-deprecating there.  Nah, I'm with Jimmy.  Small talk sucks a dick.  I hate small talk.  Yeah.  I hate just that small talk socializing bullshit.  You gotta think of yourself, though.  Think of this.  Some guy comes up to you, and not just some fucking douchebag that we deal with on a daily basis.  Hi, out there.  Who are you yelling at? 
[00:16:30]  The listeners.  Just like some celebrity on some level.  Comes up to you, and knows what you do, and talks to you.  Now, are you just gonna be like, oh, fuck this guy?  Or are you gonna be like, wow, this is kinda cool.  Maybe, you know, I could have a conversation.  It's kinda the same thing if they know who you are.  You just don't have that security.  I never think they know who I am.  Never.  But they all do.  We've seen it in here.  It disgusts me.  Over and over again. 
[00:17:00]  I've made it.  Not some, a lot at this point.  They all know you.  Oh, I saw you at the cellar.  No, but in those social situations, there's no real deep conversations going on whatsoever.  But I could have asked him what he was doing, like, hey, you working, you doing it, but  I'm assuming that he's just looking at me like I'm an anonymous fan, which I am.  He's probably just looking for pussy.  Yeah.  I don't want to interfere.  That's why I almost, there's a couple of fans that have told me, like, I've been, dude,  I tried to talk to you, and you didn't talk to me, but I literally never do that on purpose, 
[00:17:30]  and I know why, because I know how fucking awful it is to be in that position.  It's like you never want to fucking be, it's humiliating, be blown off.  But men of similar ilk, as you say.  Yes.  You know, you get a celebrity comes over and wants to chat with you, you would obviously  like to do that.  I would, but he's a Marlo, and I walked in a robe going, hey, Lou, go fuck yourself.  There's a big difference.  All right, point taken.  How many times has Marlo been on Jay Leno?  That's true, yeah. 
[00:18:00]  Jay Leno's a big Hollywood show there, Jimmy.  He has not been, to my knowledge.  There you go, so you're a little better than Marlo.  Yeah, but.  A little better than Marlo.  I'm so happy to meet him.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  That's fucking great.  You think a lot of people are discovering The Wire on DVD?  I know they are.  I think that shows he's going to continue to grow.  Dude, Gaffigan, you know how many films Gaffigan's been in?  And he said, this is how the conversation came up.  I was waiting for my chick outside the bathroom, and he was waiting for his chick, and he  goes, yeah, and it was that guy from The Wire, Marlo.  He's like, I was like, he was kind of, Jim was uncomfortable, because Marlo was sitting 
[00:18:30]  in front of him.  Wow.  And Gaffigan has worked with everybody.  So it's like, these guys have a certain fucking vibe that they, because they're on such an  amazing show.  How's Marlo's voice?  We just, he was very friendly.  He was like, he looks horribly mean, but he's a very nice guy.  Nothing worse when you meet a celebrity that is like a scary motherfucker, and then you  meet him in person, and he has like a gay voice.  Like, what the fuck?  You're supposed to be, and I'm not saying Marlo's that, but you know, it just takes you 
[00:19:00]  out of the whole thing.  No, you're supposed to be that dude from that show that I love.  He was that guy.  Quiet.  He was very quiet.  They're feared because they're black.  No, no, he was very nice.  He treated me a nice little white guy.  Not everyone's scared of black people.  What?  I am, but just not him.  Who's scared of black people?  No.  My God, who isn't?  In this room, no.  On 145th Street at 2 in the morning, my truck is getting broken down a little bit.  Of course.  Just a little bit of adrenaline. 
[00:19:30]  Of course, you've got to be a little smart.  Yeah, I get that.  I wonder if, he might have been a lucky, a lot of those guys liked Lucky Louie, but my  girlfriend was with an ear range, so I couldn't have asked because it would  have been too humiliating because we were fighting.  But I know.  No, you were fighting last time.  It's going on with you two.  Stop fighting.  Stop it already.  Stop it.  It's just awful.  It's exhausting.  It's going on.  I know.  You adore each other.  What was this fight about?  Would you just fucking, would you just love each other?  Yeah, I don't know.  We just got each other's nerves. 
[00:20:00]  What happened?  I drove home and you guys was like, what, was it two days ago?  I saw a nice, loving couple.  Yeah, it's weird.  Which, by the way, I haven't even discussed yet, but he ain't even joking.  I finally got to see Chip actually have a long conversation with his girl.  Oh, really?  She plays right into it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And I was in the front seat going, stop it.  This is really creepy.  Talks to Chip, yeah.  No, but it's creepy.  Yeah.  Like, Jimmy becomes Chip in the car.  And then his girl, like, placates to him or whatever the fucking word is. 
[00:20:30]  Well, she gets annoyed.  She likes Chip, but she gets annoyed at him.  But he's an awful lay.  Horrible.  She blew him in Montreal because...  I know, she told me.  Oh, yeah, because...  Or you told me.  Blew him in Montreal.  She blew Chip in Montreal because he bombed on stage.  Yeah.  Like, he came in with...  I don't know what happened.  I just kept saying, like, hey, your shirt looks like, you know, you got a tablecloth and  something.  And they were like, you're not funny.  You suck.  Get off the stage.  And Chip was just laying there devastated and she blew him.  I told Kenny to stop the car and I left.  I couldn't take it anymore. 
[00:21:00]  It's insane.  Chip's getting some fucking action.  When Chip gets blown, his arms are out straight and his eyes are open wide and he doesn't move.  And?  He can't believe he's getting blown.  Problem?  It's so good.  Oh, my God.  It's the weirdest thing.  To see a full conversation going on where I want to say, will you two stop it?  This is weird.  But, you know, I saw Tom Papa last night and I showed him my picture and he goes, you  know, he goes, it used to be like, ah, you and your pictures, but he's like, man, you  got some good ones.  Yeah, I'm not saying it's... 
[00:21:30]  No, no, but I mean, the other cops have all shit talked to me for all years and they  were like...  Dude, I'm looking at it and going, that's a fucking cool picture.  I would love a picture with Marlo.  But you're getting in a weird place now because your career is taking off.  You can't be running around with that camera like that.  Fucking, I don't care who they are at the Tonight Show.  You might need a new technique, I think.  You might have to go with, hey, let's take a picture together.  I tried that with House.  I got one with Hugh Laurie because he was on the last episode.  Oh, really?  He said, let's take a picture together.  Yeah, but he was...  Like, we said hello in the hallway because he asked me something. 
[00:22:00]  He was going looking for the green room.  So we talked for a moment in the hallway.  And then as I was ready to go out and he was in his dressing room just standing there  talking to somebody.  But I think he was going over a segment and I didn't know it.  Oh, you interrupt.  Oh.  Yeah, but he was polite because he had just talked to me.  I think your solution is simple.  Kill myself.  No.  Marlo?  Call my hand with a shotgun.  Marlo was a situation where you should have said, let's take a picture together.  Or let's...  Is that how you say it?  Let's take a...  Like, hey, how you doing?  When you know they know you. 
[00:22:30]  Right.  Like, again, when I got one with Michael, who I was working with, it was different because  it was like, hey, let's take a picture because I knew he liked me.  Right, right.  So it didn't seem crazy or starstruck.  So you need to start at least starting to say, let's take a picture together.  And then someone like Ted Danson, you're like, hey, excuse me, can I have a picture?  Yeah.  You've got to at least start mixing it up a little bit.  I waited until the very end with him.  Yeah.  The last scene had been done.  Yeah.  And I was almost embarrassed on the set, but I'm like, I don't care.  It's fucking...  Ted Danson.  It's Ted Danson.  He's legendary.  Yeah.  And he was very nice.  He didn't do a fuck. 
[00:23:00]  He's great.  How is he legendary, really, though?  I mean, he was obviously one of the biggest fucking shows ever.  Giant show and everything.  But it's like...  Cheers, Becker.  All you need is one big hit like that, and you're legendary.  And you're legendary.  He's been...  Literally, it's one of the top probably three or four sitcoms as far as notoriety and ever.  And that's why we treated George Wendt with nothing but respect when he came in here.  Tried to, yeah.  No, we...  Nothing but respect for him, because he's legendary.  He's a poor bastard.  I got to hear that interview again. 
[00:23:30]  One day, we got to go through the entire interview and just pick it apart.  Oh, fuck, Norm.  Anyway, right on.  So, yeah.  I was actually...  I really enjoyed the show.  I mean, if I didn't like it...  Bored to death?  I wouldn't say I didn't like it if I didn't like it.  I wouldn't be an asshole.  How many episodes are you in?  I'm only in one, but I think there's only eight.  I thought you were in more than one.  No, no.  One episode.  It was a one...  He wants to use me more for next year.  He's like, I would like to write you in for maybe something next year.  He really was great.  That's awesome. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  But you're in this episode a lot?  Oh, yeah.  Throughout the whole episode.  And which episode is it?  I think it's number three or four.  It's funny because I knew where they were in their story when we weren't in it.  So I got to see the two episodes that lead up to it.  Now it makes more sense where I was.  Some of the jokes that we were doing in ours...  Oh, that's got to help.  ...were a callback.  I was like, oh, okay.  That actually is a lot funnier than I realized because he says that in the first and the second.  Oh, right on.  I've never seen this show.  I had neither.  I've got to check it out.  Everyone said it was really funny.  It's just a weird...  This is their second season? 
[00:24:30]  Season two, yeah.  And Gaffigan's in it?  No, no, he's in one episode.  Oh, okay.  And Gaffigan's in everything.  Jim's in everything.  He's just one of those people.  He really is.  He's a nice guy.  I'm learning.  If you're a nice guy, you get a lot more opportunities out there.  And he just shows up and stuff.  Never like a big leading part, but he's in everything.  And he can act.  That's how I...  My one commercial callback years ago was for Rolling Rock Beer.  And I actually gave a good read, and they called me back.  You could do a beer commercial.  Well, you know, they didn't ask the personal details. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, huh?  Money's money.  But I remember one of the lines was like, you're sitting there and the water's rising.  I don't remember the water...  Something about the water was rising.  I don't remember what it was.  It was fucking ten years ago.  But I knew I was going to get it, because Gaffigan walked in.  He also had a callback.  I'm like, goodbye, commercial.  Done.  Jim got it.  Oh, he got it.  Oh, that motherfucker could land a commercial.  The water's rising in your mouth out of a vagina.  You'd have gotten that one.  Oh, man.  That son of a bitch can act.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's great.  He's done so many things, though. 
[00:25:30]  It's got to be second nature to him now.  Yeah.  He just recently had that movie, too.  That one...  What the hell is that?  That awful fucking...  Wow.  Good call, Danny.  Long distance relationship movie.  Fucking Danny just pulled up the commercial.  Latrobe River.  Yeah, Latrobe, Pennsylvania.  That's it.  I remember that.  There's Gaffigan.  That should have been you?  Well, that was...  Fishing in a river?  This might be a different...  Dude!  You know what, dude?  You got your master hat.  The master hat.  You got your rolling rock.  Sorry, but you would have never got that spot. 
[00:26:00]  No, it might not have been that one.  No, I'll tell you why.  Jim Gaffigan's wearing a hat.  You look horrible on hats.  And without them.  This might be the one, because I was sitting...  Can you turn the volume up on this?  It's the survival of the fittest thing.  Natural selection.  It's where the footora.  Hot day.  Beer's in a cooler.  Ice is melting.  Water level rising.  That's it.  You got a longer neck.  You don't drown.  Basic evolution. 
[00:26:30]  Basic evolution.  Wow, yeah.  I remember that.  That was it?  Yeah.  That was the one you went for.  That was...  I remember that.  That did pretty well.  Yeah, I got a callback.  I mean, again, I do commercials.  I never...  Never.  ...get callbacks for commercials.  I don't hear me.  I don't.  Would you want me hawking your product?  Yes!  My fucking cherub face and blinking eye and hooker thing.  Condoms, buck knives.  Just like awful things.  Rope.  Rope.  Jump tape.  I really should just do live reads for condoms and rope. 
[00:27:00]  Back to back.  People realize who I was talking about with the gay voice, by the way.  That was a huge disappointment.  I think I know...  Because I don't know what the fucking...  Right, right, right.  I don't give a shit.  All I'm saying is it's...  Is it a character from a show we like?  Yeah.  It's just a little weird when you expect to...  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  You just expect them to be how they are on TV.  That's all.  That's why I don't want to acknowledge their real name. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  I always said Greg Brady when he was doing our show.  I didn't want to acknowledge his name was Barry Williams.  He's Greg Brady.  He's Greg Brady.  Who am I to call him Barry Williams?  It's Greg fucking Brady in studio.  Everyone knows him as Greg Brady.  Right.  My girlfriend so didn't give a fuck about Jamie Hector.  I was so happy when I went to the cellar and I was just talking to comedians and they  all were like, oh, fuck.  They were all psyched.  I was like, yuck, thank you to her.  Good.  To who?  My chick.  Because she didn't care.  She took the picture.  Good job.  Why are you guys fighting?  We just do.  I don't know why. 
[00:28:00]  It's stupid.  We do a lot.  She kind of thought, I had to go do red carpet stuff and I never do this.  I fucking hate it.  Vacuum it?  No, it was white, actually.  I had to pop a few roids.  Paint that carpet red for the celebrities, you zilch.  Vacuum it.  I had to do some interviews and I was stuck behind Daphne on the line because he was doing  a long one with HBO. 
[00:28:30]  Of course.  I was just humiliated.  God, does he just fuck you over?  But my girlfriend got annoyed.  She was just embarrassed because it was with me.  My publicist was there.  My publicist assistant was there.  My publicist was fucking great.  She got me in front of everybody.  Entertainment Tonight people.  Really?  They won't use me, but the fact is she got them to pretend to be interested.  So I fucking, my girlfriend was me.  We just stand there and she didn't know if we were both going to go up together.  So I'm like, no, no, no.  She doesn't do, I never bring her for stuff like that. 
[00:29:00]  I don't know why.  I don't know.  I don't think she wants to get her photo taken.  Well, she's a civilian.  Really?  Yeah.  Would I?  Sure.  I don't care.  If she wanted to, I'd be happy to.  Right.  Does she really mind?  Like if, if you and her like, like arm around each other picture and it ended up somewhere.  I don't think she'd be.  No, not a big deal.  Would that upset her or anything?  I don't think so, but I hadn't really talked to her about it much.  And when we first started dating, she was like, eh, no.  But, uh, now she might like not care, but it was like such a last minute thing. 
[00:29:30]  And I, I get so embarrassed doing that stuff.  So I went up with my, with Amy, my publicist, we were just standing there and then the assistant  came over.  So my chick was just standing out there.  She could just feel like an asshole just standing there.  She's like, I would have just still at your publicist.  I didn't have to be in photos.  Yeah.  But it was like, and then I got annoyed.  I'm like, well, why are you worried about that now?  I'm working.  I don't like, I'm uncomfortable doing this stuff.  I'm not thinking about you.  I'm, I'm fucking, I don't want to do this.  It's embarrassing for me.  I feel ashamed.  Like nobody wants to talk to me.  Nobody wants to fuck it.  You know, it's stupid. 
[00:30:00]  It seems like a conversation for later.  Yeah.  Like you, and she asked me, she's like, I didn't yell about it.  But you couldn't have just avoided the conflict just by going.  Yeah, I know.  And just, just, just leave it.  I got annoyed.  Like I started getting angry.  Like, why are you?  And she's like, but I'm not.  Do you ever give in and just go like, I know I could say what I want and make a problem.  Or I could just go, yeah, I know.  I'm sorry.  And, and leave it at that.  What I probably could have said, which would have made it okay, was I wouldn't want you 
[00:30:30]  to feel like just left there on the corner.  Like, you know what I mean?  Like, but I was trying to explain to him why I didn't think of it.  It's like, you should have just asked me later about that.  It's like.  Trying to explain means you're, you're continuing.  You're adding fuel to the fire.  It really is.  He's right.  It really is.  I don't want Ant to be right, but he is.  It's like.  It's terrible.  But I wasn't even.  It's almost like, do you understand what I'm doing that?  It's a work thing for me.  It's not, uh, it's embarrassing. 
[00:31:00]  I'm not comfortable.  I'm not saying you're wrong.  No, I know, but I'm trying to tell her.  There's right and, and telling somebody, explaining yourself, which starts the, the argument thing.  And then there's, you're right, but you know what?  It's not worth the problem to explain why I'm right.  I'll just go, yeah, I understand.  End of fucking argument.  Makes the night easy.  I get too much resentment built up.  There's an anxiety thing that happens right away, too. 
[00:31:30]  And you felt it.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's no way around it.  But it could fuck your whole night.  There's no way around it, Ant.  But do you get it?  It could fuck your whole night.  If you think for a second, it could fuck your whole night, or you can get that thing out that you want to get out to get your point across, that's going to fuck your night.  And sometimes you just want to go, it's not worth it.  You've always been able to deflect, but a lot of people aren't like that.  I can't do it.  Like, I see the situation, and I'm like, oh, fuck, here's the anxiety.  And then it's too late, because I think it's some kind of fucking chemical that's released in your body. 
[00:32:00]  No, I'm serious.  And then it's too late.  Yeah.  It's too fucking late.  Maybe you don't have that chemical released in your body.  I've had it build up, but it takes a lot.  Ant's good at that.  Dude, you're technically right.  He's the smart one.  Well, I don't know a lot of people like Anthony, though.  I don't either.  I see more people like me and Jimmy when it comes to this shit.  But I talked to Tom Papa, and he said with him and his wife fight, they don't, like, I think he said here, they don't yell and curse at each other.  Well, you take it to another level, though.  He's like, they just, he's like, it's a lot of whatever, but there's no horrible things said to each other. 
[00:32:30]  They'd have a no fuck you rule.  Like, I kind of like that.  It's like they're not barbarians to each other.  You know what I mean?  No fuck you rule.  Dude, I can't.  Jesus Christ.  Wow, that's crazy.  You don't have that rule?  Dude, I have a no breathe rule.  I have a fuck you rule.  That's what I'm saying.  It's a fuck you rule.  That's how we know it's an argument.  How else would you know if it's an argument?  It's like, even though technically.  Fuck you.  Exactly.  Fuck you, you.  I don't know how to just let it go for the moment and go, look, I wish you wouldn't look at it that way. 
[00:33:00]  But she's bad at it, too.  And had she just said, yeah, you know what?  I wasn't thinking of that, that you were under pressure, too.  I think it's pretty normal what you're saying.  It really bugged me.  Oh, yeah.  From where I sit.  Totally normal.  I completely understand.  But then you take it so out of control.  But then she's like, look, I don't want to fight as it's going on.  I wasn't saying anything, but I'm already mad at the incident.  And she's like, you're just building and building and building on being mad.  And I'm saying, like, let's just not fight. 
[00:33:30]  Let's not fight.  And I wasn't yelling at it.  So you're both saying, let's not fight?  She was saying, I'm telling you, man, I really understand Mel Gibson.  It was not being heard.  Yeah, he hates Jews.  Oh, God.  And box.  No, it was that yelling into it.  It's like yelling into a fan.  It's like I'm saying to her, like, why would you get mad?  And like, why would you feel uncomfortable at that moment when I'm under pressure doing this?  And she's like, oh, it's always my fault.  And it's like, what are you doing with that?  I can't debate that. 
[00:34:00]  That's not what I'm saying.  So once you get into that, then it's like, what are you saying?  It's like, you know, that quagmire of an argument.  I don't know how to navigate a relationship, dude.  I'm fucking horrible.  No, no.  You know what it is?  You're right.  I've been in that situation.  Sometimes, though, you got to bite your tongue till it fucking bleeds and just go, for the greater good of the evening, for the greater good of the eight to ten fucking hours that I am now going to be out, it's best for me to just say, you know, yeah, I'm sorry. 
[00:34:30]  Let's just blow this off.  It's too late.  I understand.  The evening's ruined.  No, it's really not because you can get past it.  You can jump past it.  Hell fucking no.  You got to bite your tongue till it bleeds sometimes.  I'm just talking for myself.  Hell fucking no.  Yeah.  You're happy-go-lucky.  No, no.  God bless you.  No, because I'll be miserable for about a half hour or an hour, and I'll have to hide that.  That's nothing.  But then as time goes by, then you realize you're just having fun and fuck it. 
[00:35:00]  That was nothing.  So can't do that.  I'm really bad at it.  But here's the problem, though.  I can't do it, but people I've dated have done it for me.  This is where it's a weakness in me.  Oh, really?  Like, other people will go let it go.  Like, if I'm a little pissy, sometimes I do this.  When we were dating, Jim, I did that for you a few times.  Yeah, but the problem was you were a top who really wanted to bottom.  True, yes, I know.  I did want to bottom.  You used to hate when I would bottom from the top.  Or top from the bottom.  Sorry.  Fucked up.  Whatever it hurts.  I can let it go in the moment, but I'm still pissed off. 
[00:35:30]  Meaning, going back to Antipoint, my night is sort of ruined.  I sulk.  I'm not going to, like, just escalate the fight right there.  I'm not saying you can blow it off in a second.  But as soon as that chemical's released, whatever it is inside my body, I'm done for the night.  I know what you're saying.  But I'm not going to use that now and just be a motherfucker to the person.  But you have to, like, blow it off.  And then as time goes by during the night, it goes away.  But for that first, when you have to bite your tongue and say, yeah, I understand, I'm sorry, you are fucking punch in the face pissed. 
[00:36:00]  But as a half hour goes by, you're done.  And now you've salvaged your night.  You're not fucked up the whole night.  We had stopped.  I'm telling you, there was some tension between us.  And then I went to the cellar.  And there was tension.  But then I did my set.  And I was talking to Tom Papa and Bob Kelly, of course, and a few people.  And then we started joking.  Keith and them, we were just shitting all over each other, of course.  And then we were all laughing. 
[00:36:30]  And Artie Fuqua came up and started attacking Keith for his fucking old man clothes.  Oh, shit.  And it was just brutal.  That's going to be great.  And then Bob and Keith started jumping all over me and attacking me.  And then we were all...  Shackles, you motherfuckers are.  It's fucking good.  It was horrible.  That's terrible.  Oh, they saw my high school fucking...  I showed them my high school sophomore photo.  Why did you do that?  Oh, no.  Your lesbian picture.  They killed me.  So then we were laughing.  And so me and her were getting along.  And we're walking.  And we're fine.  But then I brought it up on the way home.  But I didn't bring it up angry. 
[00:37:00]  Like, the thing was, I brought it up, like, look, and about that thing before...  I was trying to explain why I just walked on and said, no, no, she doesn't want to...  Like, it wasn't to be dismissive.  I was trying to explain.  Like, it wasn't to be a jerk.  So she would know, okay, I wasn't blown off or dismissed.  But while I'm explaining, she's like, yeah, but you see, like, it's like, she's not understanding.  I'm telling you why I did that so you don't think that it was to be a dick.  Right.  And that's how, like, when the one person goes, yeah, but...  See, the thing is, I'm not saying that, but...  And you go, no, no, I know, but... 
[00:37:30]  And then it just...  Very slow...  Dude, it's insidious the way...  It creeps up.  ...does creep up.  And you don't have the time or patience at that point to get into a protracted discussion.  Like, you're involved in work.  You got to do what you got to do.  Right.  Well, by this point, we were driving to get sushi, which wound up me just taking her to  my house, just going, just go home.  Like, I didn't even yell.  Wow.  I didn't yell last night.  I was better.  Like, I didn't yell and scream.  I was like, look, I just don't want...  Like, I don't want to hang.  You go home.  This way we're not fighting all night.  You ever have a little disagreement and within, I don't know, like an hour, you're 
[00:38:00]  fighting about 20 things.  You're like, how did we get here?  Have I ever not?  You're juggling arguments.  How did we get here?  It's like a brush fire.  It's like bowling pins.  You're juggling fucking subjects.  All of a sudden, it's like a little fire.  It's like, you know, this is a little fire.  I think we can handle this.  And within an hour, you're calling...  It's a mess.  You know, it's a five-alarm fucking bling.  And you bring it up, everything.  And then the anger from the old incidents comes back.  And then you're confused.  Like, how do we get here?  Is it just a dumb argument about yogurt or whatever? 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It's fucking horribly hard to stay.  Because then I'll go off-road, but then she'll be mad at me.  And then she'll...  It's like, an argument is a weird thing, man.  I used to be guilty of that.  I don't do that anymore.  Like, bring in every fucking thing.  It's just too exhausting now.  Do you and your girl even fight?  Dude, in all the years I've known you and your chick, I've never seen you argue with her.  Yeah, we've got a healthy relationship.  We fight.  I can't picture you guys arguing.  I really can't.  Not a lot.  Not a lot, because I can't be in a relationship where there's a lot of fighting going on. 
[00:39:00]  I've always been the guy who said, fuck this, it's not worth it.  Are you ever in an argument where you're like...  Like, I don't know how to let...  This is a fault of mine.  I don't know how to let somebody else just be wrong once in a while.  Like, again, she wasn't being a cunt on wheels.  She wasn't screaming...  With someone else being wrong, that's easy.  But meaning, like, if someone's a bitch to me, realize that they tolerate my moodiness, too.  Like, instead of just...  And not jump on them for being how they're being.  Like, you know what?  Nah, she's being a twat tonight.  Mm-hmm.  And she's not being...  It happens.  Like, because she tolerates me being a jerk-off or whatever the fuck. 
[00:39:30]  I don't know how...  I'm bad at giving other people sometimes the space that I expect from them and, like,  the leeway I expect.  But are you starting to realize you could be a jerk and wrong in arguments?  Oh, fuck, yeah.  Yeah.  But if they don't...  If they acknowledge the fact that they've been a bitch or a cunt or whatever the fuck they're  doing, and usually if you don't escalate it to the point,  of a blowout argument, they will later on say, like, yeah, I fucking was moody or this.  And they'll usually, 99% of the time, apologize for what they, you know, were doing. 
[00:40:00]  Sometimes, yeah.  I think a lot of times when they know they were just being a fucking bitch, a lot of  girls will say, like, God, I was just fucking pissy.  I'm sorry.  If you don't escalate it.  My ex-girlfriend used to say to me, and you know my ex, we would fight, and it would  be getting furious, and she'd be like, all right, let's find a solution.  Let's stop fighting.  And she meant it.  Dude.  She might as well have handed anyone and said, who's going first? 
[00:40:30]  Murder, suicide.  The only answer.  I cannot.  Anger's a drug, man.  I can't not.  But I'm in that, once I'm past that point, it's literally, it has to run itself out.  That's why I say go home.  It's like, she's like, you love throwing me out, but it's really not that.  It is literally.  You want to chill.  We can't fight when you're not here.  And I break things, and I'm self-destructive.  And I don't want to do that.  Like, I don't want to yell and scream.  That's a big actual improvement. 
[00:41:00]  I'm not cheating and fucking other girls.  It really isn't like that.  See, it's not a drug for me.  I actually, this is going to be a surprise to you guys.  I hate being angry.  Fucking hate it.  Hate it.  Really do.  And I've been working on that for a really long fucking time.  You say it's a drug.  Fuck that.  You know, I like drugs.  I don't do drugs, by the way, but I like drugs.  But sometimes you do it when you don't want to be high.  Sometimes you drink when you don't want to.  I don't like being angry.  And it was tough to admit to myself that I'm a tough guy to get along with. 
[00:41:30]  That was tough for me to admit.  But it was healthy to finally admit that.  Yeah.  It makes it easier to get through some of these fucking arguments and situations.  It's not fun.  Like, holy shit, you can be a real fucking asshole.  It's hard, man.  It's hard to know that in a moment.  It's frustrating.  But as far as the anger goes, I'm like you too.  I need to get out of the situation.  And it's like, I'm not avoiding.  I need to just fucking mellow out.  It doesn't resolve.  And then get a clear head.  Oh, no.  And then you go back to it with a clear head.  So you don't have this little stupid fire turning into a five-alarm blade. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  It's like, I don't know how to just remove myself.  And I only learned that shit only a year or two ago.  That's it.  Deal with it later.  Like, don't get crazy.  There's a way to diffuse it without coming off as passive-aggressive or condescending.  And if you can do that, you can solve it right at the beginning of an argument and get away from it even happening.  You should write a book.  It's just the way it is.  Yeah, the logic sounds great, but you should write a book.  Believe me, it takes a lot of fucking self-control and a lot of, like, whole situation. 
[00:42:30]  Sometimes there isn't a situation, and that's when you go at it.  Like, I've gone at it because there's no thing that I'm involved with that I want to salvage.  I'm hanging out.  I'm watching TV.  The movie sucks.  I don't give a shit.  I'm not missing anything.  Now I'm going to get involved.  But if there's ever a situation where it's something so important that I have to function in a public environment, an appearance, a fucking grocery store, it doesn't matter what it is. 
[00:43:00]  I don't want to argue there.  So I'm going to defuse it immediately.  Oh, yeah, I stopped arguing in those situations, but you're still fucking pissed.  I'm still human.  And your day is ruined, or your night is ruined.  Now, as long as it's defused.  I know you're saying it differently.  I get it.  And enough time goes by, it goes away.  I'm just sick of the, how can I explain it, like the fight arc.  You're mad about something, then it has to get to this ridiculous fucking place where you're both blah, blah, blah, and then you're bringing 10, 12 other fucking things that you're mad about. 
[00:43:30]  And then finally, like a roller coaster, you're at the top of the ride, and then it can start calming down.  And then you get to the bottom, and everyone's calm, and then you could actually discuss the situation.  I don't want to do that anymore in my life.  I'm done with that shit.  No.  Cut the peak off.  So what I've learned is, okay, all right, you're mad about this situation.  All right, there's other things going on in the relationship or whatever. 
[00:44:00]  I'm going to leave that the fuck alone and just focus on the one dumb point in this situation with Jimmy, a red carpet incident with his girlfriend.  You know what I mean?  I'm not going to use that as a catalyst to bring in other shit that I'm kind of mad about.  From like a month ago.  I can't do that anymore.  And that, I think, is what a lot of people have been doing their entire lives.  And will continue to do.  I just can't do it anymore.  It wasn't like she said something rude or was even nasty.  I know her very well. 
[00:44:30]  She could tell us she was bothered by something.  But it's like I forget.  When people are mad, it's usually something else.  Usually it's hurt feelings or embarrassment.  In her case, just the way I handled it, I think she felt like kind of embarrassed by her, like dismissed.  Not that I didn't bring her out, but that I didn't just go look to somebody.  Whatever it was, she just felt a certain way.  And I think she was wrong to think that way.  But I don't know how to let somebody else sometimes just have hurt feelings and realize, hey, look, they're reacting.  Tell them you didn't mean it like that. 
[00:45:00]  And it will make them feel a little bit better.  You know what I mean?  It's like I just get mad that they reacted that way.  Like, and all of a sudden, instead of realizing, hey, she's, I don't know how to do it.  She doesn't either, though.  But, I mean, I'm very bad at that stuff.  Let's say hi to Greg in D.C.  Greg.  Greg.  Good morning.  Hello.  Curious how it is that the divorced guy who fucks teenage girls is giving the married guy a relationship.  You're absolutely right.  I was thinking that, too.  And the reason is because the woman I was married to for all those years drove me crazy in the same way they're talking about. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, but your problem was you diffused, diffused, diffused, diffused, and put it on the back burner for so fucking long.  And then it finally came out.  I mean, it was miserable in his relationship for the entire time I knew him back then.  There was no fixing that by diffusing a problem because it just, the problem just kept coming and coming. 
[00:46:00]  Like, you should have obviously just walked out.  Yeah, that should have been a walk away.  But I'm, I'm.  I'm not saying this works in every case.  I'm not one to talk either because I stayed in a relationship way longer than I should have as well.  But, you know, I mean, diffusing doesn't help either.  I'm really not a teen fucker.  Well, actually, that was going to be my next question.  Well, the thing with, hold on, one thing about Antho, it is harder.  Like, I don't know who, who, I don't know your ex and you don't know my exes.  But, like, I know plenty of guys who have dated women who are drunks. 
[00:46:30]  And if you're dating someone who's a drunk, it's much harder because you're dealing.  There's no reasoning with them.  Dude, me and her have fought a couple of times when she's drunk.  And she's not a drinker, really.  She'll, once in a while.  But I'm like, I'm arguing with her, like, as logically as we're talking.  And I'm like, she's drunk.  What are you doing?  Shut up.  You're not going to win this.  You're arguing with a fucking, with a six-pack, you dope.  And this wasn't the last night, but this is like, what am I doing?  Yeah.  I'll tell you one thing.  What I saw, though, your girl fucking loves you. 
[00:47:00]  And what's the other word I was going to use?  My cum?  Huh?  It's proud of you.  I saw a proudness.  Very proud of you.  Because you guys were actually talking about this event you were going to go to.  And she's telling you things you probably should be doing and stuff.  And it was nice to hear.  She really is proud of you.  I never get that vibe.  With her?  With anybody.  I mean, I just, I don't want to open your ears, man.  Because I even see that, definitely.  Open your ears, because she's proud of you and what you're doing with your career. 
[00:47:30]  She's really happy for you.  But we had this thing where I said, look, what I would like is when I walk into a room,  all I want her to do, it might sound irrational to some people, is what she's supposed to do  when I walk into the room is this.  Yeah, we are sounding like faggots.  A nice applause.  We are sounding like faggots.  Let's get some jokes going.  Are we sounding like faggots?  No, it's, dude, all these married...  Everyone's been there.  Look at every line that's left.  Everyone!  Everyone!  All these guys out there, and I tell my chick all the time, I'm not going to be the henpecked  married guy, which I react fucking irrationally against that, even when that's not... 
[00:48:00]  I don't know how you marry guys out there who just kind of know how to shut up and not  fight do it.  I'm tortured by the idea of that, and I admire your ability to do it.  Yeah, it's not easy.  Let's go to Megan in D.C.  I think she's becoming a regular.  What's up, Megan?  Hey, guys.  Hi, girls.  You sound really hot, by the way.  Have we done this bit yet with you?  Uh-oh.  She just went like, ah, and then goes on to the conversation. 
[00:48:30]  Not saying like, well, I am.  Well, at least you got a nice voice going for yourself.  Don't say that.  What?  Who would say that?  Oh, yeah, I am.  Oh, you are?  Okay.  A pretty girl.  Oh, no, she's saying who would say that.  Oh, no, I mean, like anybody that's...  We just said that to her.  Give us a quick profile.  Yeah, go ahead.  Quickie.  What do you got?  I'm the one who called about the underwater hotel.  No, that's why I said you're becoming a regular.  I remember voices.  I like the underwater hotel that smell like mold.  I care about the listeners.  I'm like Anthony that basically told all you guys to fuck off first thing this morning. 
[00:49:00]  But he does put his dick in a lot of them, which I think does bring them to the table.  Oh, that's true.  God bless him.  Hey, I put up numbers, man.  I had my day.  I had my day.  I put up numbers.  Put up numbers.  I put up numbers.  I put up my own numbers.  It really is so fucking rude.  Two days in a row I use that.  I put up numbers.  I put up numbers myself.  I had at one point, too, put up some numbers.  I had good stats.  Who do you look like? 
[00:49:30]  Oh, God.  I don't know.  Hey, listen, I just wanted to say that.  Oh, boy.  That's really depressing.  Let's see.  Oh, God.  That is really depressing.  Wow.  Just lie.  You're on the radio.  Fucking say Kate Hutchinson.  I'll get an instant boner.  She said, oh, God.  She looks like George Burns.  The last miracle I performed was the 69 Mets.  If you don't like what you see here, shut up. 
[00:50:00]  Oh.  Yes.  Yes.  I stunk.  Why?  It was good.  Oh, shut it.  I wonder what it would be like if George Burns said that.  Who wouldn't?  That's why I said it.  I want to thank Kate Hutchinson.  The world was wondering.  I want to thank Kate Hutchinson for taking me out of my booby fetish.  Really?  Yeah, I realize.  Her flat little boobies got you all.  I hate to tell you what woman did it for me.  Oh, great joke.  Bad for my future. 
[00:50:30]  There's a bunch of them.  A picture of her out by the Sloan Kettering dumpster.  Jesus.  Well, check that off the list.  Oh.  So far unpredictable.  But I didn't say it.  Really?  As I made a check mark.  I know.  You're on the radio and you actually get a check mark.  You're a method actor.  Thank you.  Megan?  Yeah.  Megan.  We don't care what you look like.  Yeah, fuck it.  Yeah, hey, Facho.  I met a picture to Jimmy once and he said it was beautiful.  And I've met Jimmy a couple times.  Oh, okay. 
[00:51:00]  Hi, Megan.  Was I nice to you?  I met you at your show.  I gave you a six-figure comic strip that I drew.  What show was it?  I don't remember.  In D.C.  I'm in Houston.  I've seen you.  Okay.  How many years ago?  Last year and then two years before that.  Did he want to take a picture with you?  I did take a picture with him, but, you know, it was me wanting to take a picture with him.  But was I nice about it?  Fatty.  You were very nice.  Oh, she's fat.  And I came to your guy's show when I was pregnant and I had a baby named Grady and I asked her if it was a black name. 
[00:51:30]  Grady?  Grady.  Oh, God.  Why did you name your baby Grady?  Because she wanted someone to say something that rhymes.  And you did.  Baby Grady.  Your son.  She goes, you don't remember?  No.  I remember voices and basic stuff, but why did you name your...  Another kid named Lamont.  Oh, you got a black husband?  You chopped your wife and daughter up and then you blew your brains out.  You married man, are you, Mr. Grady? 
[00:52:00]  Sorry.  Grady.  What an awful name for a child.  What are you, insane?  Yeah, you got a black husband?  No, I don't.  Why Grady?  It's probably a school thing for your grades.  Oh, very good, Chip.  Yeah, why Grady?  Can I tell you why I called?  Yeah, but why Grady real fast?  That's a legit question.  That's a 10-second answer.  I have no good answer.  We just like the name.  Oh, okay.  How did you like the name Grady?  There's nothing.  I kind of like it because it's different.  But did your family just get really mad? 
[00:52:30]  His mother said, the only people I've heard of named Grady are black people.  Exactly.  I'm sure she said it like that.  And she said black people, didn't she?  I've never...  I bet.  I've never run across a black person named Grady, though, either, so...  Oh, whatever.  She's from Stanford and Son.  Oh, fuck.  We know.  I forgot until just now.  Maybe she spells it G-R-E-A-T-Y.  She wants a kid to have an ego.  Grady.  Her other son is terrific-y. 
[00:53:00]  Goody.  The kid that isn't quite as smart.  Yeah.  That's middle child.  Marvelousness.  Grady, get in here.  Grady.  Your mother's...  Grady, what my improv is not.  Megan, why are you calling?  What do you want?  I was just calling to tell Opie that he said something smart.  Well, I say a lot of smart things.  Oh, there you go.  Because he said that you release a chemical when you fight, and you're releasing the stress  hormone, cortisol, and it makes you sick all night. 
[00:53:30]  It makes you physically sick.  Yeah.  You release that...  Is that why they say stress causes cancer and shit like that, because of that stuff?  What?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Elevated levels of cortisol make you sick.  Yeah.  See?  Yeah.  Chemicals are releasing your body.  They can fuck you up, man.  I'm telling you.  I know.  An overdose of like...  It takes a while to calm the fuck down.  Jägermeister will make you sick.  That's bad.  I gotta go to work, guys.  Bye.  Oh, well.  Go fuck...  I mean, I have fun.  Are you on the beltway?  No.  I'm sitting at school, and the teacher, I gotta go. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, what grade.  It's okay, Kenny.  What grade?  Don't fret.  What grade?  High school.  High school?  You teach high school?  Yep.  What's going on in the high schools?  Blowjobs.  Rainbow parties.  Same thing.  It's always been going on.  I don't know about that, man.  I think it's a lot different now.  You know.  A lot of sex going on.  A lot of texting going on during class, or is it one of those schools where you gotta  leave your phones at the door?  No.  They've all got their phones.  We just try to keep our eyes open.  What a nightmare. 
[00:54:30]  Good luck.  You have to leave your phones at the door in schools, then?  Some schools, they figured out they have a box up front or something, because the kids  are just...  It's called the teacher.  It's called Megan.  They're texting their asses off.  Can you imagine being a teacher?  There's no way these kids aren't texting the entire day.  How about having everything in your little notepad in your phone, and you just kind of  pull it out, you hit it, and all the answers to the fucking test are right there.  Or you fucking take a photo of the fucking test, and you text it to somebody, and they  text you back the answers, and then you send them something, and then you have an iPhone, 
[00:55:00]  so eight hours later you get it, after you've already failed the test.  They could be Googling the questions on the test, and just text it right back to you,  and you're done!  That's tough, because when I had a cheat sheet that was as big as my thumb, I was paranoid  that they were going to catch me.  I don't know.  With a phone?  As soon as you're lifting up your phone during a test, I would imagine the teachers are all  over you.  It's right there under your fucking jacket.  They're walking up and down the aisles, though.  No, not that you ever see Fast Times.  One guy's doing a Rubik's Cube. 
[00:55:30]  He wasn't looking.  There was notes written on the bottom of a lizard.  But you could actually Google.  I didn't think of that.  Megan, we're still trying to figure out what you look like.  You're a teacher.  If you had sex with one of your students, how many years would you get?  Oh, very good.  Good question.  How many years?  How many years do you think you would get?  An answer.  Five?  Oh, that's not good.  It's not bad, though.  No, probation is the best. 
[00:56:00]  Probation is the best.  One year...  The hot teachers get the probation.  One year is okay.  Two years, eh, hurting anything over two to three years.  Oh, okay.  Bad fucking news.  Bad news.  I have one more boring thing to tell you guys.  All right, go ahead.  Opie, I know you like to read.  You should read a book called Homer and Langley about the Collier brothers, because it's, you  know, the hoarders?  Yeah, we talked about it.  Homer and Langley?  That's their names.  Do you know we talked about this yesterday?  Yeah, yeah.  I was looking at it, and it's a really good book, and it was written kind of in the perspective 
[00:56:30]  of one of the brothers, and he was blind.  So it's kind of fiction, but kind of nonfiction.  It's really good.  All right, I might have to...  Where's the movie?  I might have to start reading again.  I'm thinking anyway.  I love you guys.  Bye.  Netflix.  Fuck Netflix.  Let's see the movie.  Tell me what you want to do.  Going through the same shit Jim is.  Used to tell wife an argument can live with you or without you.  Oh, that's a good one.  Have you ever been in an argument with your girl?  People walk in the room, and she acts fine. 
[00:57:00]  They leave, and she's back to being a bitch.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I prefer that, actually.  Really?  It gives you like a time out.  Yeah, I guess you're right.  It gives you a time out.  Sometimes you can use those moments to start getting along, too.  And how great is that, where you're like, oh, good.  I think the fight's over.  Yeah, yeah.  And then that person leaves, and it's right back into it.  You're like, what the fuck?  Or it did kind of diffuse it a bit, and you can kind of...  Just go out on auditions, because your acting is terrific.  Get a little touch of reality.  Can I explain why Ann is able to diffuse...  Whatever.  All right, so we don't need to do that. 
[00:57:30]  And his kid's school, teacher takes away phone when caught with it, whatever.  All right, let's say hi to Frank on Long Island.  Frank.  Hey, Frank.  Hey, Ed.  Just wondering if maybe you learned this skill,  how to diffuse these situations from your childhood.  Because I know, I grew up in a similar household where, if you didn't like diffuse situations,  the monster blew up and threw plates and stuff like that.  Yeah, I was always the diffuser of the problems between my mom and dad when they were arguing. 
[00:58:00]  I didn't do it very well as a kid.  I was horrible.  All I would do is, like, say I had a stomach ache, and I would start crying.  And hopefully, I thought they would pay more attention to me than their fight.  Because, like, you know, I'm the injured child.  I have a medical problem.  Please help me and stop fighting.  But they would keep fighting.  I'm not sure it's healthy, but, I mean, I think that's maybe why...  It's not!  I think so.  Yeah.  You bring up a good point. 
[00:58:30]  It didn't work very well when I was a kid, but as I got older, I realized...  And I'm not saying in every situation this works.  Believe me.  I've had some fucking screaming matches over horse shit with girls.  So, I'm just saying, like, especially if you're out and you have something to do,  you don't want the whole night ruined.  And then you want to defuse it so you don't ruin your whole night.  But, uh...  I'd look at it like it's almost like a survival kind of thing. 
[00:59:00]  You know, because if you get the monster mad and they're screaming and yelling and violence and...  So, I don't know, maybe it's just a skill that you learned.  All right, I'm going to check it out.  Yeah, I think he's right.  It did kind of come from that.  I don't like confrontations and shit like that.  I'd rather defuse it than have an argument.  Um, I don't win many arguments and many verbal arguments.  Uh, because I'd usually rather just cash it in and say, all right, whatever, let's take care of this. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  We're done.  I don't like confrontation.  No.  All right, so let's break then.  Ooh, we're going to eat.  Yeah, let's do some eating, man.  Yummy.  And then we're going to talk about some shit after the break.  By the way, I want to cover the fact that in the Archies, Obama and Sarah Palin sit down and Archie Comics are getting political.  They sure are.  We'll talk about that.  Jughead eats her pussy.  That's right.  And I still...  Goddamn rich cunt with his Jughead hat. 
[01:00:00]  We started talking about Braylon Edwards, never got to finish that, so after the break, it's a big fucking football story.  It certainly is.  And Michael Vick we got to throw in there, because that's a big fucking football story, too.  Yeah.  I'm just trying to do some teases.  Oh, yeah, and Vinny, uh, okay, and Vinny from Jersey Shore are being offered 30,000.  Only 30,000 to pose nude in Playgirl.  I would love to be naked in Playgirl. 
[01:00:30]  Seriously?  If they gave me six months to get in a kind of shape...  You would do that?  Oh, my God, dude.  In a second.  Why?  Why not?  Fucking take a Cialis, let that cock flip up.  The Virus.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  There is no you.  There is only me.  There is no you.  There is only me.  There is no fucking you. 
[01:01:00]  There is only me.  There is no fucking you.  There is only me.  O.P. and Anthony.  You know that Club Soda Kenny watches Dancing with the Stars?  Does he?  I didn't know Kenny was a faggot.  I did not know that.  Someone had a good line on Twitter because Margaret Cho was dancing, so they said the  show is actually called Dancing with Sars. 
[01:01:30]  That's very funny.  Ah, that's good.  I kind of like that line, whoever that was last night.  Made me chuckle as I was watching fatties fucking cry over their fatness as I was eating  ice cream on the couch enjoying my son.  Biggest loser is back.  I don't know why.  I don't know why I watch.  I don't know why.  Yeah.  They all have a reason why they're overeating.  I just don't get it.  I don't get it.  Do you get it, Jimmy? 
[01:02:00]  The eating thing?  It's the pain that I felt when I would shut it.  Well, we all have pain.  We all have shit going on.  I guess it comes out in different ways.  I'm trying to have an open mind about it.  Yeah.  But why can't you stuff yourself with something that tastes good or is healthy?  No, but it's rational.  But it's like, nobody, and I'm not taking it for obese people, but nobody plans on eating  themselves into a wheelchair.  Sometimes it's when you're young.  It's what you learn gives you comfort. 
[01:02:30]  Again, it annoys me, but it is a real addiction, man.  It's fucking whatever.  I just ate a girl's cereal.  Dude, I got some lactate coming so I can have some girl's cereal with you.  My two girls.  I eat multi-grain Cheerios because that's...  Trust me, I want Captain Crunch.  I do.  Absolutely, but you figure that bag of cocks would be more delicious.  Anthony had to point out that there's two girls on the back of my cereal box.  There's two dikes.  Dikes in the back.  There's one black girl and a white girl, and they're looking at each other, and they're  looking like, wow, there's five whole grains in this cereal, and they're chatting about 
[01:03:00]  the cereal and how it helps their period, and Opie's just huffing it down.  It says 110 calories, and then Jimmy goes, wow, that looks good.  Can I have some?  I'm like, it doesn't look good.  I'm not going to sit here and make believe this looks good.  Captain Crunch is great if it didn't leave stalagmites hanging from the roof of your mouth.  As far as Cheerios go, the multi-grain is a little tastier, but it sucks a dick.  I like a good loop.  I want fucking donuts.  I want all that shit.  I know.  But you're saying-  But I had this with a goddamn banana. 
[01:03:30]  You have to-  And I got shit happening in my life, so I should be a big fat pig, so why- I don't get it.  I just don't get it.  Dude, I spent literally-  I'm suffering.  I want to eat stuff that is way tastier than this.  30 minutes on the toilet last night, I was late going down to this thing because my shits  were coming out in a little meh, meh, meh, because-  Wait, what is meh?  It's like your asshole-  I know, exactly.  Squeezing, and a little piece- 
[01:04:00]  A nugget?  And then Slong just goes, meh.  A little milk dud comes out?  Yeah, it looks like a cat.  It's constantly like-  A little piece falls out.  Because I eat egg whites every morning, and it's fucking-  It binds you up.  Is it binding you?  Oh, yeah, it does.  You're being bound?  Dude, my stomach was cramped, I couldn't stand, I had to shit badly.  You ever-  Yeah.  Because I eat egg whites, because I don't want to get fat.  You ever have one that feels like it's just fucking opening your asshole to the point  of almost no return?  Yeah, absolutely.  And then you look at the bowl, and it's a little bloop. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, I've had that too.  What happened?  A little bloop, it's like, how is that possible?  I thought this was a good one.  Right.  You ever get the bloops?  Oh, God, yeah.  They're just falling out like fucking goat pellets.  Dude, I was late last night, because I couldn't get off the toilet.  I'm like, how fucking old am I?  It's all those egg whites, they kill you, but I don't-  The churlite.  I couldn't get off the churlite.  I don't get the food addiction.  I know I'm being an asshole, because people are suffering with it. 
[01:05:00]  I just don't- I don't understand it.  It's a hard one.  I don't really- because I suffer, I don't want to eat like this.  Well, that's the difference, is you've got to be willing- you're willing, I'm willing  to eat stuff that you don't want to eat, they have to be willing to do it  too, and they're not.  It is a lack of willingness, too.  Is there- is it willpower?  Does it come out in other ways with me, maybe, and it's not a food thing with me?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't think willpower works, because they say when you have diarrhea, will yourself  not to shit.  It doesn't work.  Willpower is-  Is crap?  Yeah, you've got to admit you're weak at something.  If I'm weak at something, I have to admit I'm weak, and then deal with it from there. 
[01:05:30]  But if I keep trying to fucking fight-  I'm weak!  I'm weak!  Brian in Colorado.  And I'm no better than anyone, because that's what ends up happening when I say this shit.  I just don't understand it, and I would love to understand it better.  That's all.  In my stupid mind, I don't get it.  Whatever thing you do-  Because when I eat like shit, I don't feel good about myself, like I need to do that more.  I quickly realize, wow, I don't like eating like that.  What do you do that makes you feel better?  Yeah, what I just do, right.  You gotta do something you do that is unhealthy for you, maybe it's emotional, whatever that 
[01:06:00]  is, that's like what it is.  Mine's probably just dumb.  I probably work out obsessively.  I don't know.  You know what I mean?  I know I don't have to work out as much as I do.  Bad, something else.  I don't feel bad.  I don't know.  Maybe I'm beating myself up.  I don't know.  No, there's something else.  Whatever it is, it's like something that you do that's comforting.  It goes beyond just like a little too much exercise.  I like chocolate.  No, I don't know what it is.  Exercise is good, so that's not like a fat thing.  No, but I do it to an excessive point.  Obviously me, beer. 
[01:06:30]  I love beer, and I know I have too much of it.  Do you think you have too much of it?  Yes, but I'm not stopping, so fuck you.  Brian, go ahead, buddy.  Hey, Oak, you were just talking about how you argue, and you can't let it go.  I can't even understand that.  It's the same way.  I don't understand how you can't just let the argument go just the same way you can't understand how, when I'm depressed, I eat. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, I'm not saying, like, my way is right.  Trust me.  I'm just trying to have more of an understanding as I get older.  Like, when you're eating, I like fried food, sure.  I talk about Popeye's.  I love Popeye's, but I don't love it to eat it every day.  Like, if I eat Popeye's chicken two days in a row, I'm, like, physically ill.  Like, I don't, you know what I mean?  Yeah, you just don't feel good about it.  No, but other people, they don't ever get to that point.  Hold on, let me finish my point. 
[01:07:30]  They don't ever get to that point where they feel physically ill.  I'll eat, like, shit for, like, we were just on vacation for a couple weeks.  I, you know, not as well as I usually do.  I eat, like, shit.  And I couldn't wait to get out of that mode and back to just sort of more of a normal eating habit.  Like, does it ever get to the point where you just feel, ugh, I don't like eating like this?  No, it gets to the point where it's just, like, I wish I could eat a salad and enjoy it.  No one enjoys a salad. 
[01:08:00]  That's all horse shit, too.  I mean, you pop a few things in your salad to make it taste a little better,  but no one is actually sitting there going, mmm, more salad, please.  You know what?  I love that goddamn Japanese salad with that ginger dressing when you get sushi.  Oh, is that good?  You get the noodle thing?  Oh, oh, oh, okay.  Just the regular house salad with that ginger orange dressing on it.  Huh, fabulous.  That's true.  I'll eat that.  Yeah, buddy.  Yeah, I'm 300 pounds and I run triathlons. 
[01:08:30]  It's just I don't eat right.  What's at the checkpoints?  Cake?  Swims through chocolate vats.  He goes to Willy Wonka's.  It's Augustus Gloop with a gold fucking medal.  Athlon is a candy.  He wants to try Athlon.  I can eat half a pizza and then go run three miles.  That's not bad.  See, I love pizza.  I could easily eat half a pizza right now, but then tomorrow I have no desire to eat pizza. 
[01:09:00]  And tomorrow I would definitely...  Yeah, you just stop and you almost feel guilty.  That's the difference.  Not almost.  You feel guilty.  How much do you want John's pizza right now from the village?  Oh, my God.  Like, it's pizza fucking amazing.  I eat pizza maybe three times a year.  We were talking apple pie yesterday.  Three times a year.  I would eat a half apple pie, no problem.  I want pizza.  I want apple fucking pie.  You can never not want another slice of pizza.  No matter how much you have and how full you are, if there's another slice in that fucking box,  you're looking going, I want to eat that.  I want a slice of fucking pizza right now. 
[01:09:30]  Is it the best?  Dude, I never eat it.  Me and my chick were in the village, and she was, like, trying to cover her black eye.  And then I...  And we walked by that...  We were going to eat John's pizza, but you can't buy by the slice there.  You can only buy...  Is John's pizza the one that's featured in Louie's opening?  Don't know.  Is it the pizza shop right down from the cellar?  No, that's Ben's.  That's Famous Ben's.  Oh, Famous Ben's.  Yeah, that's the one.  Why?  Is there something in my apartment in there you'd like to make fun of?  Look at Kenny.  What happened?  Whoa.  With his spectacles on. 
[01:10:00]  See, everyone's saying salads fucking suck.  Like, I add mandarin oranges to fucking sweeten up the salad.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And I'm not saying I'm better than anyone.  I just don't get it, because I know I feel like shit if I'm eating crappy for too long.  That's all.  That's all I'm saying.  You know, Harry Mandela's on your show saying that he has a problem where he gets a thought  in his head about that rug needs to be straightened out or whatever?  Yeah.  That's the way it is with me with food.  There'll be, like, a pizza sitting in the kitchen.  And I'm like, man, that fucking pizza would really, oh, man, that'd be good. 
[01:10:30]  And I just ate.  I'm like, but damn, I can't wait until lunch.  I'll just go eat this son of a bitch now.  Yeah.  And it's just, it's in your head, and you just can't stop that thought about how good  that pizza is.  I've had parties at the house where we order pizzas, and I just sit there, and I'm like,  one more.  Yeah, just one more.  And then I wake up the next morning and go, did I have fucking four slices of pizza?  And I just beat myself up. 
[01:11:00]  Like, what an asshole.  But there's a lot of guys and women out there, guys and girls out there that don't have that  feeling the next day.  No, shit.  That's what I'm...  They're the ones that they film for the B-roll on those fat spots for the news.  Bunt.  You bunt bitches.  All right, brother.  That's all.  That's all.  Like, they don't get that feeling.  And I wonder why.  That's all.  They have to probably get the feeling, but then they just blow it off by eating more food.  Yeah, but you physically feel sick.  Yeah, yeah, you feel sick.  I don't want to eat like that anymore. 
[01:11:30]  And it's not even...  It really isn't physical.  It's more like...  It's a mental thing with me, where it's like...  I go, why would you do that?  You're a fucking idiot.  You're trying to take care of yourself.  You're exercising and shit.  And then you can eat four slices of pizza?  You fucking asshole.  That's what gets you...  Like, it's not so much a sick feeling, because it's delicious.  And that's the only reason you'd mow down four slices.  I wonder if John's is open right now.  Ah, Jimmy! 
[01:12:00]  I want pizza.  When do pizza joints open up?  I don't know.  I don't think it's 7.30 in the morning.  A lot of them are 24 hours, no?  I don't know.  No?  Opie's eating issues make him sound like a teenage girl.  Aw.  I'm sorry, Jeff.  I'm sorry I'm not your hero.  Maybe you are a hero.  If he was a teenage girl, he'd be at my house a lot more.  Right, right.  That's right.  Maybe Anthony's hero.  You're...  My hero.  Anthony's definitely your hero.  All right, let's...  We can move on.  Oh, the only reason I said Biggest Loser is because that's what I was watching instead 
[01:12:30]  of Dancing with the Stars.  Ah.  So, Kenny watches, religiously.  So does Sam.  And guess who got kicked off last night?  Who?  I don't give a shit about this show, but I'm shocked as far as the show goes that they  would kick that guy off.  Who?  Somebody that...  Do you even know who's dancing this year?  Not a clue?  It's somebody that got ratings and...  Oh, cut to the chase.  David Hasselhoff got kicked off.  The Hoff? 
[01:13:00]  Isn't he the goof factor that...  You know what I mean?  Was he that bad?  Huh?  Was he that bad?  I don't know.  I didn't watch.  Was he that bad, Kenny?  How does Kenny know about dance steps?  I've done a Watusi or two.  Yeah, I know how to dance.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You watch Dancing with the Stars.  My wife watches it, so I have to sit there politely.  You're in one of those relationships?  Can't you go to another...  Why can't you go to another room and watch what you want? 
[01:13:30]  The zenith is in the living room.  One little hot cathode ray fucking TV that leaves vent marks up the wall.  Does she watch something you want to watch?  She watches, like, animal shows.  I adjust the aerial.  And the housewife shows.  Don't you have another TV in the house?  Animal shows like, what, First 48? 
[01:14:00]  No, four-legged.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  Because you're not...  When couples have to watch shows together and one person doesn't want to watch that show,  there's no bonding going on.  You got it wrong, G.H.  I choose to spend quality time with my wife.  Oh, see that?  But that's not quality time.  That's...  You're capitulating.  You're happy to be there, right?  Yeah, I don't know.  Happy to be here.  My girl, I think, was watching, I think, because she has no desire to watch The Biggest Loser. 
[01:14:30]  I don't know why I do.  It's ridiculous.  It really is.  So I'm watching that.  That's a great joke there.  We both had a great joke.  I know, we both had a great joke, and we just...  You know what?  We're sparing you right now.  Thank you.  I'm the genuine article.  The genuine article.  Sure.  My wife likes me.  My family likes me.  My friends like me.  Dude, I didn't want to say something like that.  Like, she has no desire to watch The Biggest Loser, so she must never look to the left on  the couch. 
[01:15:00]  It was almost like...  It was such an obvious softball.  I didn't know how to get it.  I know.  Just fucking pound me.  I didn't know how to...  It was almost like you had dropped a $100 bill on the ground.  I'm like, do I pick it up?  Do I wait till it leaves?  Do I give it back?  Just take your fist and knock my teeth out.  Please do that.  Because I deserve it.  She was watching Bad Girls.  I was watching Bad Girls.  Bad Girls?  Yeah.  Yeah.  See, we don't have to watch TV together.  There's shows we'll watch together.  Always Sunny in Philadelphia is one of them.  That's a good one.  There's a few we like watching together. 
[01:15:30]  And then there's other times like, yeah, I'm going to watch this stupid show.  And you watch your stupid show.  And during the commercial, I'll run in and see how you're doing.  Yeah, that's what you do.  That's all you need to do, Kenny.  You don't have to sit and watch Dancing with the Stars if you don't want to.  You watch the shows with your wife, though, right?  Yes.  You're old school.  You're an old school couple.  Yeah.  Yes.  You enjoy watching them together, right?  Yes.  Do you comment?  Does she comment?  You go like, yeah.  Yeah, she'll go, you know, she'll have like the animal channel on. 
[01:16:00]  That's good, though.  I like those shows sometimes, right?  She'll go, oh, come on in.  Look, it's a story about the life of the zebra.  And you do go in, right?  Yeah.  Happy to see it?  Yeah.  Yeah, because I see the zebra has a better life than me.  Now, Kenny, you're a guy who, in an argument, you can just turn it off.  Like, if you and your wife's being cranky one night, like, are you able to just go, ah, whatever, she's just being cranky and not feed into it?  Like, you can do that.  Yeah, I just, I just let her browbeat me. 
[01:16:30]  He's such a beaten man.  You rule, brother.  You rule.  You do?  Yes.  Have you ever been just yelled at and just taken it?  Constantly.  What do you do?  How do you not get angry?  It's a woman's world.  But he doesn't even get mad when he's driving, though, can he?  I guess because he knows he's a killer, but he has the ability to, like, just go, like, I'm like, how do you not get into a rage that guy just cut you off?  He's like, eh, whatever.  If you were as big as he was, wouldn't you take advantage of that? 
[01:17:00]  I would be fucking knocking dudes out left and right.  Of course.  Yeah, but G.H.  He doesn't do nothing with it.  Don't mean bad.  But he doesn't do nothing with his size.  No.  No.  He intimidates.  At the time, more than half the time, I gotta walk away, because I'm not an animal like fucking Kenny.  Look at this fucking guy.  6'5".  He intimidates.  He lets little fucking ladies, like, cut him off in traffic.  It doesn't bother him.  But that's a true killer.  It didn't help me when I had to sit in a doctor's office for over two hours yesterday.  Oh, shit.  Did you knock out the doctor? 
[01:17:30]  What happened?  That made me mad, because the arrogance of those fuckers.  They're the worst.  The worst.  So what happened?  You okay?  I just had to fucking sit there like a jerk-off.  Did you say anything like, this is rude?  I almost did.  What's with the waiting room?  He almost did.  He never does that.  And then there's the other smaller waiting room.  I don't want to get shitty with the doctor, then have him take it out on my son, who might need a third shoulder operation. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, my God.  Well, stop hitting him.  For God's sake.  He's just a big guy.  Big lug.  You figure he's beating everybody.  I don't know.  So that's why you weren't there for you?  You were there for him?  Yeah, yeah.  I took him, yeah.  You're a good dad.  Why a third shoulder operation?  Did they fuck it up, or is it just a process?  I don't know what's going on.  We've got to see what's happening.  It's not a good situation.  Oh.  Damn. 
[01:18:30]  It's a nerve, right?  The muscle?  No, he separated his shoulder twice and had to get reconstructive surgery.  Orthoscopically.  Now they're saying, like, the third one, they're just going to have to cut them open and use cadaver parts.  Can't they just put one of them fucking stainless steel ball and fucking sockets in there?  No, he's got fucking shit in there already.  I don't know.  Isn't it amazing?  Like, would something like that...  I mean, his shoulder's inconvenient, but it's not life...  You know, your life will still be...  Yeah.  It's not going to change your life.  But you can do things. 
[01:19:00]  But certain things you've got to do.  No, he's right-handed, too.  Yeah, yeah.  It's right.  That's got to be a motherfucker.  Four kids, 18 years old, and now his fucking life is like...  It's a shooting hand.  It's all about that, yeah.  You know, he was supposed to go in the military October 5th.  He can't go now.  Oh, fuck.  He had a good job, too.  That sucks.  Maybe God has a plan for him.  Oh, my God.  He's not following in Dad's footsteps.  Going into intelligence.  They're good.  They have brains, and they're handsome.  Oh, my God. 
[01:19:30]  The milkman?  Yeah.  Oh, Kenny, I'm just trying to make levity.  You don't have to.  The truth is the truth.  Oh, I'm sorry.  They have bigger cocks than me.  It doesn't like uncomfortable mocks.  Things will work out for the best, I'm sure it will.  I don't.  He's pouring his heart out about his son, feeling his son's life is over at 18.  It's not, though.  And you're making jokes.  It's not.  There was other bad news in the club sort of family yesterday, too.  What happened?  You're healthy.  I'm sorry. 
[01:20:00]  Isn't he terrific, Kenny?  Terrible.  Isn't he terrific?  Look, he's quick with the jokes.  You've got to give him that.  Yeah, and he'd light up your smokes.  Someplace that he'd rather be.  There's some place that I wish he was.  He's as dumb as a piano, man.  Have a second.  Kenny?  My dog ate poison yesterday.  The whole band?  I don't bite. 
[01:20:30]  I stink.  Oh, that's hilarious.  No, his diary.  The dog took two bites out of his thoughts and threw up.  I'm sorry.  How's your dog doing?  How's your dog doing?  Boo.  Boo.  My wife took it to the vet, and they gave it medicine to throw up.  Yeah?  So the dog's fine.  Wow.  They just hold up a photo of Kenny. 
[01:21:00]  Kenny, of course.  And the dog is like...  Just picture him talking to you for more than five minutes.  What does your dog eat poison-wise?  What kind of poison?  Are you leaving around the house?  No, no.  It was something his wife had prepared for him.  Kenny, the dog ate your dinner.  That's terrible.  That's awesome.  That's terrible.  That's really funny.  Oh, God. 
[01:21:30]  What do you eat?  The exterminator comes like, you know, whenever...  Oh.  ...and like puts a...  Something under your pillow.  Oh, God.  Oh, fuck.  I can't take it.  Just throw him the towel, Kenny.  Throw him the towel.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  So the exterminator came...  What do you got in the house that you need an exterminator?  No, it's outside. 
[01:22:00]  They like spray like for carpenter ants and shit.  Yeah?  Yeah, like I got a contract.  They come like, I don't know, whatever, whenever they come.  So they just fucking come and you don't have any bugs or any problems,  but you have exterminators just...  Spraying around and spraying shit.  Yeah, I don't...  Why don't you wait until some fucking sign or something comes up?  By the time you see them, they're all over.  And they have little things built all over the yard.  No, no.  Carpenter.  Little tree houses.  Little teeny hammers and nails all over you, stepping on them. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  Then the iron worker crickets come and make like a bridge of something.  Oh, shit.  So, Kenny, what did your dog eat?  I don't know.  Like, they can't...  The exterminator came like nobody knew.  The combination of peanut butter and ball sweat got the boy being sick.  The dog just felt ashamed.  The dog was embarrassed.  He knew that eating the snack this way was wrong. 
[01:23:00]  That was terrible.  He hated licking up the stuff off Kenny's stomach.  Clean the mess.  I'm sorry.  Very sad day at the...  Yeah, yeah.  That's terrible.  At the house.  So, what did they have to do to make him better?  What did he eat, though?  I don't know.  Some kind of poison they put down.  How did he eat the poison?  That means he had to eat actually something that the poison was on.  Was it a solid chunk?  Was it sprayed? 
[01:23:30]  Do you know what the exterminator's doing at your house, Kenny?  You've got to watch this shit.  Did the dog even eat any poison?  This is the report I got from my wife because I was at the doctor's office with my son...  Right.  ...for three hours.  ...while the poison incident took place.  Jesus.  And then she took the dog to the vet and they gave it some kind of medicine to make it puke.  How'd you know it was poisoned?  Or how'd your wife know the dog was poisoned?  Because when she went back in the house... 
[01:24:00]  You went all bent.  It was an awful joke.  Like, she went out the back door, but then she went in the front door, and on the front  door, on the doorknob, was like a thing hanging on the doorknob, like, oh, we were here today.  And we poisoned your yard.  It was from the dog.  She said, I'm not feeling well.  Yeah.  I can't communicate other than writing.  And I don't know if it's pellets or whatever.  We poisoned your yard from your neighbors. 
[01:24:30]  It sounds like this was preventative.  Yeah, it's like maintenance.  No, you don't know if the dog...  No, as far as the dog goes, you don't know if he actually ate any poison.  I don't know.  My wife...  Freaked out a little bit.  Yeah, and she took it to the vet right away, and they gave her some kind of medicine.  The dog puked, and then the dog was fine.  Oh, so you're not even sure if it was really, like, fucked up.  No, thank goodness, because if anything happened to that dog, it would... 
[01:25:00]  Oh, that would be bad.  Who would feel the effects the most?  You?  She probably would, because she's there with her wife.  Yeah, your wife.  No, you're right.  I would feel the effects more, because I'd be collateral damage.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What kind of dog is it?  A miniature pincher.  Oh, I've seen them.  They're adorable.  They're very cute.  They look like pinchers, only they're small.  No, but it's hilarious to watch clips over Kenny walk this dog.  Oh, my God.  That must be funny as fuck.  Kenny being 6'5".  Oh, look, there's a picture of a miniature pincher right there. 
[01:25:30]  It's adorable.  They are very cute.  Is he affectionate?  They're cute as hell.  Yeah, it's a female.  Does she kiss you?  No, she's not allowed to lick.  Lick you with a poison tongue?  It's not polite.  You don't let it lick your face?  It's adorable.  There's no reason to have a dog if you don't let the dog lick you.  What's wrong with you guys?  Wow, that's bizarre.  You got to let the dog go.  Yeah, let the dog lick you.  It's giving you kisses.  It goes, oh, look, kisses, kisses.  Dog doesn't lick.  No?  No.  Do you pet it? 
[01:26:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I pet it.  I think Kenny's like, two pats on the head to show affection.  Yes.  Two hard pats.  Hard pats.  Good boy.  Good dog, yeah.  That's it.  Fetch the paper.  Eat the poison.  Well, I'm glad that that worked out.  Yeah.  That would have been tragic.  Why did Hasselhoff get kicked off?  I didn't actually see it because by that time, you know, the show comes on 9 o'clock.  I'm like sleeping on the couch anyway. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, snoozing.  You know.  They should have kept him.  He's the goof guy.  Every year they're the goof guy.  The goof factor right there.  They have a goof guy.  They'll have clips of him tonight on TMZ drinking.  But you said that it should have been Margaret Cho.  Yes.  Because it's between Margaret Cho, The Situation, and The Hoff.  Those are the only three dancing?  No, that was like the bottom three.  The Situation had a handicap because, I guess because of his busy schedule and lifestyle,  he could only train for five days. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, so.  Was he good?  So they're giving him a break?  No, like they were like yelling at me.  They said like, oh, he sucks, but he's only had a few days?  Right, right.  Well, fuck that.  If you suck, you suck.  Get off.  Right.  So they're going to say.  But they thought The Situation would have drawn more viewers than The Hoff, so they get  rid of The Hoff.  And Margaret Cho makes the Asians watch.  And the dykes and homosexuals because they love Margaret Cho.  Right. 
[01:27:30]  Is she funny?  I've actually, I heard she's very dirty on stage, which I was surprised.  I've never seen her act.  I like her.  I don't know Margaret Cho at all.  You don't like Margaret Cho?  Oh, you like Asians.  No, she can't.  Do you like that whole thing?  I met her once.  She was nice to me, so I like her.  She had large breasts.  No, she doesn't.  They look good in person, but she's got.  No.  She's got fat breasts.  She was very nice to me.  So again, I've never watched her act, but I heard she was really dirty.  That's not big breasts.  Oh my God, is that her right there?  Let me see.  What is she doing?  She's wearing pasties.  That's an older picture too, right? 
[01:28:00]  Oh yeah, her breasts look good.  She got a bunt that's hanging over her genitals.  Her breasts, all right, admit it, they don't look that bad if they weren't on such a fatty  body.  Thank you, Danny.  Danny said.  And she's stretching her arms way over her head.  To make the breasts look good.  She's doing like a fan dance.  She's got one of those big ostrich feather fans.  And I'm not feeling the Margaret Cho.  Nah.  Not at all.  She got one of the big frying pan faces.  I don't like that at all. 
[01:28:30]  Well, she's Asian.  Well, yeah.  Some people say plate face.  I think you got a point there.  What's that?  Some people say plate face.  I hope that type of racism doesn't go unanswered.  Yeah.  I hope so.  Fun and games is one thing.  We don't need to bring stereotypes to the picture.  That's true.  You're right, Jimmy.  Words hurt.  Margaret Cho nude.  That'll do it.  Why is there men on that?  That's Harry Potter, man. 
[01:29:00]  Why is that on the Margaret Cho naked?  Good old Harry Potter nude in front of the horse again.  With this big dick.  This big unclipped English cock.  Is that her in the red?  No.  I don't know.  Nah, fuck that.  Why are we...  All of a sudden you start...  Fuck.  I do that at home, too.  You get stuck on something when you're searching, like, images.  And then you go, why am I doing this?  And then you try to get back to what you were doing. 
[01:29:30]  Something responsible banking.  You know who's a real goer on that show?  Who's a goer, Kenny?  Sarah Palin's daughter.  Oh, she's on there?  Yeah.  Bristol Palin's on...  Bristol's pretty fucking hot.  Is she good?  Punch up some photos of her on Dancing with the Stars.  Bristol's pretty hot.  I want to see Bristol Palin dancing with the stars.  She's got big boobies.  Now we're talking big boobies.  She is cute, man.  Let me see a picture of her face.  They got a picture of her dancing.  Let me see that.  Let me see that picture right there of her face. 
[01:30:00]  Now, fine.  Well, I can't see...  I want to see if her face looks good.  I need more than a face picture.  Nah, I want to see her face first.  We need a...  Yeah, give me face first.  You've seen the face.  All right, look.  She's fucking hot.  She's cute.  She's cute.  I'm going to give her that.  Okay.  Now, body.  She's tight.  Now, let's get body shot.  Who's that?  Wow, that's her right there?  Yeah.  All right.  That ain't bad.  She's sturdy stock.  Sturdy stock, eh?  You like that?  Wide hips.  Good for birthing. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, that's nice.  All right.  Nothing wrong with her.  I didn't know she was doing that.  So she's obviously still on?  It was only one night.  Well, I don't know how the show works.  Why is that show so popular?  I don't know.  People are dumb.  Florence Henderson is on it.  What is she doing?  Is she dancing or a judge?  She exposed her stomach.  What was she doing that for?  She's got to be 70.  Show her Mr. Brady never came.  That is amazing how two people can have the exact same occasion. 
[01:31:00]  Her dancing partner, that guy, his father is Florence Henderson's dancing partner.  Really?  Fascinating.  That is so amazing.  Wow, look how hot she is there, huh?  She's okay.  She's cuter because you know who she is.  That's Bristol Palin right there?  Nah, she's pretty hot.  Nah, she's pretty good.  No matter who it is.  Let me see her.  She almost has a chubbier Trump's daughter look.  She's got a little Eskimo in her, doesn't she?  Yeah.  Does she?  Fucking running up there building dumb ice hats. 
[01:31:30]  She is a little chub.  Look at her.  She got a gut.  Yeah, I'm not feeling it.  She got a gut.  Ah, she'll fucking lose that.  That's because that's like baby fat.  She almost looks like Ivanka Trump a little in the face.  Right?  Maybe.  Mike in Arizona.  Mike!  Mike!  Hey, I'm like Kenny.  I'm old-fashioned.  I got to sit there and take it with my wife, but it's nice to see some of those beautiful  dancers like Kurt Warner's red-headed dancer partners.  She's really hot.  But anyway, the reason why Hoff got kicked off the show is because he just stood around, 
[01:32:00]  walked around, did a few hip gyrations, and made porno faces the whole time.  70 porno faces.  Did he?  If you get to see the tape, it's, you know, it just, he deserved to get kicked off.  That's your opinion.  Oh, shit.  Oh, boy.  A Hoff fan over there.  Kenny's a Hoff fan.  You tell me he wasn't making a bunch of porno faces doing hip gyrations like she was dancing  all around him?  Come on. 
[01:32:30]  You know what's great with this show as I'm watching this?  A lot of people say we're nuts for saying that Bristol Palin is pretty hot looking.  She's not even bad.  She's fucking bad.  She's a pig.  I don't think she's saying she's bad.  I'm not saying she's a fucking hot babe, but she's not that bad.  What the fuck are you talking about?  There's 20 pigs that could have been on this show.  Jesus.  She's not fucking bad.  Calm down.  She's not that bad.  You know what it is with this show, too?  The celebrities don't really dance much.  The other people are doing all the moves, and they kind of spin them around once, and 
[01:33:00]  then they stand there, they shake their tits, they fucking grab them again, the pro spins  around again.  And were Sarah Palin there?  Like Ozzy and Sharon?  Oh, yeah.  Supporting their daughter?  No.  She was in the...  She's out doing another tea party rally.  She's too busy.  She was too busy doing the Archie's comic.  Yeah, too busy having coffee and tea.  That's what she does.  What's that mean?  I was supposed to be on that show.  No, you weren't, Chip.  I was.  I hurt myself. 
[01:33:30]  You lie all the time.  Sarah was at the premiere.  I've seen it here.  No, you didn't.  No, he did.  You're a liar.  All right, so dance with the stars, and you're forced to watch TV together.  I don't understand.  All right.  No, I'm not forced to.  I don't understand why couples can't be honest with each other.  Go, look, I know you don't want to watch this show, so we have eight TVs in the house.  Go watch something else.  Watch something else.  Eight TVs.  That's all.  Are they too big to drive them up the elevator?  Oh, eight TVs.  Eight TVs. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, I thought it was all-terrain vehicles.  I knew what it was.  That joke was a piece of dog shit.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  Angry Chip.  I don't like Angry Chip.  Let's go to Eddie.  Where's my fucking Lactaid?  Eddie.  Eddie.  Who got him?  Eddie.  Who's this?  From St. Louis.  What's up, Eddie?  Hey, good.  It's been a while.  I'm just going to call to talk about some of the football stuff.  Oh, you're the guy that talks about hockey.  Nobody likes that stupid sport.  That's why I'm talking about football.  Well, that's sports, stupid.  He talks.  Speaking sports.  Well, there's a big story here in New York with his Braylon Edwards, and who gives a fuck 
[01:34:30]  that he was drinking and driving, and now people are pissed that he's actually going  to play on Sunday?  You know, honestly, I'm a big Jets fan.  I live in St. Louis.  I think it's fucking retarded for them to sit the guy.  I mean, they said they're going to sit him.  But under the T.O. rule that came out a couple of years ago, they actually can't deactivate  him.  What's the T.O. rule?  You remember when T.O. was having that bullshit with the Eagles front office, and they deactivated  him?  Really?  Yeah, seven.  Well, basically, under the collective bargaining agreement, you can't do that anymore. 
[01:35:00]  But, you know, he was actually drinking with Dante Stallworth a couple of years ago  before his whole vehicular manslaughter thing, and then he had two teammates in the car  last night.  But, yeah, I agree.  I don't think he's going to do that.  You know what?  I don't care.  I don't care what my athletes are doing.  But we need Braylon Edwards on the fucking field if we're going to march toward that  Super Bowl this year.  Yeah, I think the Michael Vick story is a lot more interesting.  No, but this Braylon Edwards is weird, too, because now the Jets are like, well, we're  not going to star him.  So they're kind of showing they're doing something because he was caught drinking and driving. 
[01:35:30]  And I say, fuck all that and just start this stupid guy.  But aren't you innocent until proven guilty?  Exactly.  Exactly.  But then people are outraged that he's going to play at all.  Wow.  It's his job.  People think that they can't go to work.  How many people with your jobs are not allowed to go to work if you get in trouble, DWI, unless  you drive for a living?  Well, you know, the funny thing is, if you stack this up against someone like Leonard  Little, who actually killed someone, it's not that big of a deal.  But even if he gets convicted, the only thing the NFL can do to him is fine him 50 grand. 
[01:36:00]  I don't even think they can suspend him.  Look, drunk driving, obviously, is a serious thing.  I'm not saying, you know, but this is such bullshit.  Because the Jets are just making believe they're doing the right thing.  They don't want to fucking sit the guy to start the game.  They want him in there right off the bat.  Yeah.  I mean, I know they wanted to get away from that story about the locker room, but this  is not a step in the right direction.  Who gives a shit?  I don't give a shit.  They're going to have a good fucking year.  What's up, brother?  I just noticed Mel Tillis' comedy album is coming out.  Oh, can we get a copy of that? 
[01:36:30]  Oh, my God.  He's still alive?  Can we get a copy of that?  Country music legend, they're calling him.  The first comedy album.  Winner ACM's Cliff Stone Award 2007 deducted.  They're blowing fucking shit up his ass right now.  Reminiscing with Mel Tillis.  Latest album combines old stories and new.  Country Music Hall of Fame in 2007.  Is he still stuttering?  Is that his goof?  Well, that's always been his thing, right?  I don't know. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, when Cannonball Run and all those movies that he was in.  What do you think of this Braylon Edwards, now that you're a big Jets fan, Ann?  Well, I think obviously he did something wrong there.  Point one six.  His personal life.  I think he should pay for his crime, but it shouldn't affect his job or what he does on the field.  Let him play. 
[01:37:30]  Fuck it.  Let him deal with the consequences that he has to in his personal life.  It shouldn't deal with football.  It has nothing to do with football.  Stop with this moral shit.  Yeah, no.  In sports.  No, we understand.  He fucked up.  He's going to have to deal with it in his personal life.  It's going to cost him money, legal fees, maybe criminal penalties.  Who the fuck knows?  But there are people in the NFL that have done far worse.  They've killed people.  Look at fucking Michael Vick.  The guy went to prison.  He killed dogs. 
[01:38:00]  Well, we move on.  You never hear about it anymore.  No, because he's fucking great and they all love him.  He did do his time, so.  Look, he did his time.  He's a piece of shit.  Well, don't do the crime if you can't do the time.  That's what I say.  Don't do it.  That's Beretta.  That's not even yours.  Right, Chip.  You guys know Michael Vick is starting this Sunday night.  I know, he's starting.  How great is that?  It's fucking fantastic.  A little time goes by and it's like, ah, there he is.  No one cares.  Starting quarterback once again.  No one cares.  Why was there ever any question about him starting or not?  And the funny thing is they gave that fucking Cobb kid like 10 million bucks. 
[01:38:30]  I mean, Vick's, people forget he was number one overall draft pick from college, probably  the best rushing quarterback of all time.  You've got to start him.  Of course you do.  The guy's just got to run.  He's going to have no knees by, like, next year.  But we're just...  You've got to realize they have no O-line.  He's going to get sacked 50 times.  They just got to nail his kneecaps as he tries to run because he cannot throw a ball.  We're just a bunch of weirdos because it was like, all right, we'll accept Michael Vick  being back in the NFL, but he can't start.  And we don't really want him in quarterback. 
[01:39:00]  And now that they're going to start him in quarterback, there's outrage that he's starting.  With some of these assholes.  Some of them.  Although Philly...  Most don't care.  I don't know if this is true.  Hold on.  I'm going to put you on the line with Scott in Jersey there, Eddie.  Scott, is this true?  Yeah, that's what I'm hearing.  The Philly paper called Michael Vick top dog.  Top dog?  Come on.  Yeah, it's on all the sports headlines.  Those Philly fans are assholes.  I mean, why the fuck would they get rid of McNabb in the first place? 
[01:39:30]  You remember, they booed him when they drafted him.  Guy's going to be a Hall of Fame quarterback.  Oh, Philly likes to do things their way.  Yeah.  What can I tell you?  Exactly.  They're very unique down there.  They really are.  Just nasty people.  Hey, can I ask you guys one question?  What do you think the odds are of an NFL lockout next season?  16-7.  Really?  Wait, wait.  What did you say about a lockout?  As I said, do you guys think that's...  We heard you!  Eddie, why don't you call, like, sports radio? 
[01:40:00]  You're, like, perfect for that.  We're just a bunch of dummies that make believe we know sports.  I like to talk all kinds of shit.  I just, you know, heard you guys talking about it.  Figured I'd call up.  Yeah, I mean, I don't even know the starting lineup of the Mets anymore.  Oh, I mean, fucking Mets fans don't know that shit.  Well, I do know that Joe Torre had to back the fuck off.  Yeah.  Because he's like, yeah, I would manage the Mets.  And then, what's his name?  I don't even know his name.  Jerry Manuel.  Thank you.  He's like, what the fuck?  Why are you talking about my job? 
[01:40:30]  And then Joe Torre sort of had to say, oh, well, you know, sorry.  I really can't blame Jerry Manuel.  Yeah, my prostate, which is, you know.  Huh?  I really can't blame Manuel for saying that.  I mean, Torre's been around the game a long time.  I respect him, but he should have known better than do that.  Torre just got lucky.  He got lucky with what?  Yeah, the right players.  Right players, right players, right time.  He's not out there hitting the home runs or throwing the ball 100 miles an hour.  If you look at the great managing job he did in 07 when the team just fucking collapsed,  I mean, that's the problem with a guy like Torre with a great loaded team. 
[01:41:00]  They don't get enough credit or respect for what they do as a manager, I think.  I don't know.  I think managers in baseball are pretty much a waste of fucking time.  Torre was good at balancing the giant names on the team.  That was good.  They all respected Torre.  Enough of me.  I guess to a point.  Enough of me.  A robot could do that stuff.  Yeah, Jimmy's now talking into his banana.  Robot coaches.  Jimmy's talking into his banana.  And the banana's now.  Opie, turn on his banana.  Would you just...  Eddie. 
[01:41:30]  Eddie.  Eddie.  Let's shoot this fucker.  So, yeah.  That makes sense.  I just said that.  I don't know what he was talking about.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Take care.  It makes sense.  No, no.  We got Pittsburgh.  Eddie.  They suspended Big Ben, right?  Yeah, he's going to be coming back, I think it's, what is it, four games now? 
[01:42:00]  So, he did some shitty stuff off the field, and why does that affect his play on the field,  and why do they have to suspend him for four fucking games?  Well, I'm going to be honest with you.  I fucking hate the Steelers, but if he wasn't, I mean, even indicted or charged with anything,  there shouldn't have been a catch.  It's ridiculous, this morality crap that's going on in sports.  Yeah, it's fucking bullshit.  It's always been like that.  I've known a couple people that have played in the NFL.  I'll just say it that way.  And the shit the NFL does to these players, they shouldn't be talking about morality at all.  They treat their players like crap. 
[01:42:30]  Half these guys, they only play three, what's the average, like three years, and then they're fucked.  Right, and then they're bankrupt three years after that.  They absolutely are.  They don't have any future, because they don't set these guys up to have a life past football.  So, stop with the morality crap.  One day, you're probably going to see some big fucking lawsuits against the NFL with all these retired players.  They got fucked up, and they're not even taking care of them.  Oh, who do you know?  Yeah, it's a horrible company, the NFL, when it comes down to it. 
[01:43:00]  So, stop with the fake morality crap.  Anything else, Eddie?  Oh, not much.  I mean, hockey's going to be kicking back up.  Shut up!  But, you know, other than that, no, nothing.  Yeah, I'm looking forward to my Islanders this year.  Oh, yeah?  They might win 30 games.  All right.  I had to yell at Anthony, too.  I'm sorry.  Enough.  Yeah, enough.  Bye-bye.  Let me suffer in peace, please.  Giving them some shit.  In my shitty arena out there on Long Island.  Ah, the Long Island Coliseum, the Nassau Coliseum, the place is great. 
[01:43:30]  Kevin Smith's like, I'd go to a game.  I'm like, no, you wouldn't.  I don't want to take you there.  It's a shithole.  Archaic.  So, I'm going to go to a Devils game, because he's got the Devils tickets.  I got the Islander tickets.  He goes, I'd go.  I'm like, nah, nah, nah, nah.  I'm embarrassed to take a big shot like Kevin Smith at Coliseum.  Is that awful that you're embarrassed to go to a fucking arena?  I'm embarrassed.  Because the Devils are, their arena's awesome.  They haven't changed that place since I saw Charlie Daniels' first play, The Devil Went  Down to Georgia. 
[01:44:00]  It's got to be.  Live.  Yeah.  At this point, it's got to be the worst arena in the NHL.  Horrible.  I can't think of one that's worse.  If someone's got one, I would love to hear it.  She'll probably play in the Roman Coliseum.  That joke was terrible.  I'm sorry, Chip.  It's a bunch of bullshit.  The Roman Coliseum doesn't play no fucking hockey.  All right, you know that.  Wow, he's nasty today.  I'm going to eat my Cheerios.  You're eating your faggot cereal with the chicks on the back? 
[01:44:30]  All right, what are you going to do, man?  What is that?  Is that good for you, period?  Do you just stack the Cheerios up as a tampon and shove them in your vagina?  I love the fact on the cover, there's a delicious bunch of harvest grains in the back.  Yes.  And there's a scale falling off the spoon.  Yeah.  Who wants to eat that in people's calluses?  You know that just says, doesn't taste good.  All right, look.  If there's grains and a scale on the...  It's actually not bad, dude.  If there's a scale on the top, it's not Froot Loops. 
[01:45:00]  This is Wayne Cocaine.  It's Omar and fucking Mr. Sosa.  Sosa.  The Cocaine Scale.  Because Sosa says so.  You expect me to believe it's only 110 calories?  Because Sosa says so.  You brought that line.  What kind of cereal do you bring, Frank?  I never liked Captain Crunch.  I never trust him.  I told you a long time not to fuck me with sugar pops, you fucking little monkey. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, you're going to kill Count Chocula, Frankenberry?  Makes you feel like a big man.  Someone just tweeted the front page of the Daily News, the Philadelphia paper.  Yeah.  This is why Philly is the greatest city in the country.  There it is.  Look at that.  Front fucking page.  Michael Vick.  Top dog.  Top dog.  There it is.  They knew it.  They don't give a shit.  They know. 
[01:46:00]  I'll literal ant.  I'll retweet that shit for everybody.  What an asshole I am.  They know.  How great is that, though?  They don't give a shit.  That's great.  I think it is.  Who cares?  All's forgiven.  Speaking of the Coliseum, they have changed one thing.  See, when you go to any other arena in the league, in between periods, you walk out into  the concourse, and it's nice and wide, and you've got options.  You can go to bars and get any type of food you want.  Well, you know how narrow the hallways are outside? 
[01:46:30]  It's like a fucking atomic collider.  It's ridiculous.  Yeah.  You miss half the period because, God forbid, you've got to take a leak.  Every other arena has enough bathrooms for everybody.  They actually added an outside area.  How?  Which is nice when you're playing hockey in fucking January.  You mean outside, outside, where you walk outside the arena?  Yes, to give yourself a rule.  Freezing cold.  Where they have...  What are they thinking?  Where they have kind of like a beer tent, the makeshift bar, and shit. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, that's good.  So you could shiver your ass off.  Exactly.  That's what they do for everybody.  There's bathrooms out there, too.  Yeah, there's bathrooms out there.  Port-a-johns.  Try to put your shriveled, freezing dick out.  Dude, Port-a-johns.  You pay a lot of fucking money to go see a hockey game at the Coliseum, and you go outside  to fucking take a leak in a port-a-john.  My God.  While these other arenas, like I said, nice concourses.  They raised their prices again this year.  Yeah, I know they did, Travis.  You're not getting your fucking Canadians tickets this year.  Oh, Travis. 
[01:47:30]  I know.  Like, three years ago, top seats were like $100.  It's $160 now.  Wah!  But they're not a team that's performing to that scale.  You're fucking...  You're executive producer now.  Nice to hear John Q. Public and Joey Bagadonis going back and forth about...  You've got to be making the big bucks now to afford that, right?  I'm sorry, what?  Yeah, exactly.  They make chocolate Cheerios?  What? 
[01:48:00]  Holy shit.  I'll be making them in about three hours.  That sounds disgusting, really.  Chocolate Cheerios.  Shove your tongue right up there.  Wow, really?  Yeah, some chocolate Cheerios.  Thank you, Surfing Trucker on Twitter.  That's great.  Chocolate Cheerios.  What does that taste like?  That doesn't have to be good for you.  Tastes like fucking fruity...  Is it the fake chocolate?  Cocoa Puffs.  It tastes like Cocoa Puffs.  Is it real chocolate?  But only round.  You know what I mean?  I have no idea what I was saying.  Is it fake chocolate or real chocolate?  Stupid Steve from Big Shore. 
[01:48:30]  What?  What he just called chocolate Cheerios.  What?  Turn my mics off.  That's fucking racist.  Real quick, it is.  Terrible.  And he's so clever, but he has to be a fucking racist.  Go ahead, real quick.  I'll just yell it out.  All right, go on.  Yeah.  That's terrific, Steve.  He's the worst!  Oh, is he terribly hysterical.  Say it on the air, man. 
[01:49:00]  I can't.  Why?  I'm not gonna, because it's awful.  He's smart.  It's terribly racist, and I really want to continue my job.  Let me go to Rich in Florida.  Rich.  Hey, guys.  I just wanted to say, I'm not the...  Jimmy's right, the NFL.  Of course I am!  Nobody shits on their employees worse than the NFL.  However, it's that whole culture that all of us bitch about, about, oh, he's a fuck. 
[01:49:30]  If he wasn't a superstar, he wouldn't be getting in trouble.  And the NFL is trying to change the culture of their brand by telling the guys that they are accountable for their actions.  Whether you like it or not, it is a, you know, it's one of those things they are trying to tell the young people that, you know, hey, you're accountable for your actions.  And that's basically why they do it.  It has nothing to do with the sport, though.  Well, of course it does.  Do that off the fucking field.  I don't give a shit. 
[01:50:00]  Who cares?  He's the star receiver for the fucking Jets.  If you're a lawyer, you're allowed to go to court.  If you're a doctor, you're allowed to go to the office.  If you're a singer, you're allowed to go to sing.  If you're a dancer, you're allowed to go to dance.  Hey, hey, I got a question.  What if he was the wide receiver for the Patriots?  You'd be all for him.  See, that's such a dumb thing.  Get him off the fucking field, I would say. 
[01:50:30]  If it happened to Randy Moss, I'd say fucking Randy Moss should be able to start.  Simple as that.  You know what?  I wouldn't care because it doesn't matter.  The Jets will beat him anyway.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  They put him ahead.  They're like, yeah, that's what we're talking about.  Oh, and then what happened in the second half?  Oh, that hurt.  Well, what happened was they spent the rest of the game being amazed.  Yes, they were amazed by the catch.  They were just amazed by the catch, and they forgot that there was another half to the game. 
[01:51:00]  Oops.  Oops, right?  And then the Jets having to, like, not star him, so it looks like they're kind of doing  something.  It's all horseshit.  Come on.  It really is.  Hey, guys.  I got a question.  Wasn't it on y'all's show where they got the Philadelphia fan, when y'all asked him  where he'd think about Michael Vick?  He said it wasn't my dog.  Wasn't that on y'all's show?  Probably.  Yes, it was.  Look, what Michael Vick did to those dogs is horrible, but, you know, I got to stand  by my point.  Whatever. 
[01:51:30]  He should have fucking continued playing, you know, football right away, especially after  he did his time.  Yeah.  Anything, sir?  Comment?  I don't know.  Did he hang up or something?  He bailed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh, this is good.  This is for you.  Is that what happened?  David in Kansas City, doing some freestyling right now.  Kansas City.  David!  Good morning, boys.  Hi, sir.  I just thought Anthony would like to know that in 1862, Lincoln signed the preliminary 
[01:52:00]  Emancipation Proclamation, freeing all the slaves by the first of next year.  Thank God.  The first of 1863.  For Abe Lincoln, the first step in civil rights.  Thank God.  That started the whole ball rolling.  Right.  And got us where we are today, with a very diverse country, where everybody chips in and  helps out. 
[01:52:30]  What's that?  I knew you were going to chime in.  And it's a wonderful thing.  Thank God for that.  Amen to Abe Lincoln in 1862.  If it wasn't for him, we wouldn't have our wonderful president we have now, correct?  Exactly.  That started the whole thing.  And you won't get a bigger fan than me right here, right now.  Have a good day.  Thank you.  All right.  It's opposite day. 
[01:53:00]  What am I going to say?  That's almost as good as when I was in camp.  It was a Halloween celebration in July, and none of us had costumes, so I just put on  my clothes backwards and went as backwards, man.  No, you didn't.  I did.  Please say you didn't.  I went as a costume.  I was backwards, man.  I would pull your fly down and fuck you in your asshole.  I wouldn't have had to.  I probably would have slipped them down for you at that age.  All 13 and shit.  Oh, tussleable.  Backwards.  I'm backwards, man.  Are you?  Backwards, man. 
[01:53:30]  No, let's make you feel welcome.  Oob.  Oob.  It's backwards.  Oob.  Oob.  I just ate three and a quarter bowls of Cheerios.  Did you really?  You still got to do it compulsively eating.  That's crazy.  I'm starving this morning because I'm not eating much.  I'm fucking hungry.  Let's get that pizza.  I like when I don't eat for like an entire day and a half.  You ever do that?  No. 
[01:54:00]  Just lay in bed, knock it out of bed, don't eat for like a day and a half, and you're  just fucking ripped.  Yeah.  It's like, yeah, your fucking stomach's flat.  Just feel good.  I've been eating less lately.  Yeah.  Yes, I would like to get that pizza.  Let's go.  Bobby will come in soon.  Let me tell you something.  Bob Kelly, he's all about the pizza.  Really?  I just found a video of myself saying I'm all about the poop on stage.  No, you didn't say all about anything.  No, it was a goof. 
[01:54:30]  I'm all about the poop.  I used to say that.  It's about shit.  Can you bring that in?  But did you mean like the all about part or were you goofing?  It's a goof.  I would never say in seriousness to an audience, I'm all about shit.  No, I think you would.  You're right.  Where is Bob?  I hope he's dead.  Oh, my God.  Don't be hit by a car or something.  He's here.  Oh, Bob is very nice.  Where is he?  Down the hall.  Jim in Indiana.  Jim.  Hey, Opie.  Jim. 
[01:55:00]  Jim.  Tell me about the Islanders arena.  What time?  When do they open that?  What year?  Yeah.  79, 80?  No, I think it was before that, sir.  Well, what about jail?  What about Jules Arena in Detroit?  That place has been open since 79.  You don't hear about the Red Wings fans bitching about their arena.  No.  Have you ever been to the Nassau Coliseum?  Yeah.  Have you been to the one?  I mean, it does suck, but.  Is the one in Detroit worse?  What's that?  My thing was simple. 
[01:55:30]  I think we have the worst arena in the NHL.  It's a shimmy.  Oh, absolutely.  I have family in Philly, so I get to go to Flyers games.  They got a great arena down there.  I get to go to the Devils games across the river.  They have a great arena.  Of course, the Rangers play in Madison Square Garden.  And then Nassau Coliseum, it's like the minor leagues.  It's embarrassing.  Awful.  Being a long-time fan.  If they actually won a game.  It has nothing to fucking do with that.  There's a guy that's willing to do the right thing and get a new arena, but Ant knows the 
[01:56:00]  fucking politicians are fighting over it.  What I'm saying is, if they actually had a team worth winning, do you think people would  be bitching about it, or would they be more worried about the team?  I want them to win, and I want a nice arena.  I think it would get the people psyched.  I think the team would get a little more psyched.  And it's a bigger issue.  This would be great for Long Island.  I don't know if you know Long Island, but Long Island doesn't have many areas to just  hang out.  And they want to build this whole fucking lighthouse thing, where it's like a central 
[01:56:30]  area where people could go and shop, go to concerts, fucking go to sporting events.  And where are they thinking of building this?  On the same site?  Pretty much.  Oh, brother.  Uniondale?  Yikes.  Sucks to be y'all.  Yikes.  Dude, yeah, I have a right to bitch being a long-time fan.  It's a shithole.  Well, I mean, I've been a Detroit Red Wing fan since I was old enough.  The whole city of Detroit stinks, sir.  Ooh.  So you don't have to worry about winning.  Right.  Yes, it does. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, that's when fucking Aretha Franklin's son got beat up here last night.  You just keep talking.  Aretha's son got beat up.  In Detroit, yeah.  In a gas station.  What happened?  I don't know.  Gas station, something.  I don't know if he knew the people or not.  It's just more thuggery of Detroit.  Detroit's full of thuggery.  He's in his 50s, her son.  Whenever you hear someone's son, you think they're 20.  Yeah.  But Aretha's kind of old.  B-E-A-T.  Find out what you can do to me.  There it is.  I love my hometown. 
[01:57:30]  B-E-A-T.  Whatever.  Good for you.  I guess you like watching your team in a shithole.  All right.  We're different.  What do you want from me?  A kiss?  When Detroit plays an Islander, you'll see what a real team is like.  Whatever, dude.  I think we're going to have a pretty good team this year, so we'll have to wait and see.  Okay?  I hope so.  See ya.  That was a terrific phone call.  Wow.  He's mad.  He just got mad that I was dissing Detroit.  Stinks.  Is Detroit coming back?  No.  Not at all?  No, they actually made it smaller.  They showed it on The Biggest Loser last night, and it looked like, in the summer, it looks 
[01:58:00]  all right when there's a lot of green stuff growing.  Detroit, the houses, some of the buildings, a lot of the buildings, especially on the periphery,  all just broken down, abandoned.  How do you know this?  Blown out.  No, I've done a lot of research on Detroit.  I know a lot about Detroit.  Probably only going for one take on Detroit, though.  And then they, well, no, they actually pulled the city limits in to eliminate those abandoned  buildings from the city limits so they could say that Detroit is now a better place and 
[01:58:30]  doesn't have as many abandoned buildings.  But they just, all they did was pull in the borders.  You know what would be nice if some of the money that was spent protecting that fucking  piece of shit, Ahmadinejad, was spent revitalizing a city like Detroit?  We waste so much fucking money on shit that I don't care about.  That no one cares about or should care about.  Why do we have to protect him?  If he wants to come here for the United Nations thing.  Bring your own fucking people. 
[01:59:00]  He does.  Why does the NYPD have to deal with that shit?  I agree.  We shouldn't have to.  Why?  That's not our responsibility.  No, it's not.  It's up to him to make sure he's well protected.  Not us.  Fuck him and the horse he rode in on, I say.  That's right.  1972 for the Coliseum.  Yeah, I was thinking early 70s.  There you go.  1970 fucking two.  That's it, huh?  It's almost 30 years.  Fuck.  40 years, right?  Yeah, 40.  What am I saying?  40 fucking years.  Man.  It's a long time.  And they haven't done shit with it. 
[01:59:30]  Dude.  Scoreboard fell down.  I'll take it to a game.  The presentation sucks.  Don't even want to go.  I should just, I should have a talk with them.  Their presentation sucks.  Have a talk.  Jill Nicolini, when she was the Islander chick there, was great.  She really was.  Just skate around.  And then they-  Smelled all good.  And then they got this bra that took her place that-  Dina, sorry.  You're a fucking twat.  Ah.  I think her name's Dina.  She sucks.  The guys used to fucking like just- 
[02:00:00]  Jill?  Oh, they'd hoot and howl.  Not only was she really good to look at, she knew how to, you know, get the crowd going  and stuff.  Yes.  Their presentation is just awful.  Isn't that hysterical?  You can't pull up any pictures of her without me showing up on some of the sites.  Oh, that one's good.  I'm not on the front page there.  What happened?  They've moved on, Anthony.  Oh, they've moved on.  See if you-  Left me in the dust.  Take her out on another date.  You'll be on the front page of her Google Images again. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  Hey, there we go.  Look at me.  The happy couple.  Yeah.  From days gone by.  Ah, that was years ago now.  My God.  Time goes by very quickly.  I don't know.  They didn't close in the borders yet, eh?  Jason in Detroit wants you to know that.  What happened?  In Detroit, they didn't close in the borders yet.  No?  Nope.  I thought they were doing that last year.  Well, they should.  It's a catastrophe, that place. 
[02:01:00]  Madison Square Garden is older.  So why does it look so much better?  Because they fucking, like, redid it a couple of times.  Yeah.  Yeah, because even though you have an old building, you could still, like, get some newer shit in there.  Redo it.  Even the seats are horrible.  Oh, they're awful.  I sit down and I'm not sure if the seats are even going to support me by the end of the game.  It's rickety.  It really is terrible.  Look at that place.  It's rickety.  Come on.  Old fucking piece of shit stadium. 
[02:01:30]  All right.  In the middle of Uniondale.  Hempstead.  God, take your life into your hands just driving around that fucking area.  My gun store is right across the street.  That tells you something right there.  Business is good.  All right.  Should we take a break?  Yeah, we could do that.  Oh, goodness.  Yeah, let's do that.  Bob Kelly coming in to say hi today. 
[02:02:00]  Yes, he is.  So he'll join us next.  Stay there.  Only in the new show on the virus.  Sirius XM.  You're perfect.  Yes, it's true.  The world without me.  You're only you.  You're only you.  You're just to wait to hide.  Hey.  Not for you.  Holy shit.  My breakfast is getting gayer by the hour. 
[02:02:30]  Now Kenny just gave me yogurt.  Activia.  Ah.  I know you're a big fan of the Activia yogurt.  And then it has a pink fucking give hope with every cup.  Of course.  Pink label on it.  It's to cure the booby cancer.  Got to do that.  Got to cure the booby cancer of the people out there.  Yeah.  So eat your shit yogurt.  Activia.  It helps move things along when I feel sluggish. 
[02:03:00]  Doesn't all yogurts do that though?  Yeah.  This is more horse shit they shove down our throat.  It's all crap.  Eat any type of yogurt every day.  I'm sure it's going to keep things a-moving.  Yeah.  It keeps things moving.  I'm moving.  Jesus.  Team Weeby?  Team Weeby.  Bob Kelly?  Team Weeby?  I'm not Team Weeby.  I don't know what Team Weeby is.  I'm a little upset.  Team Weeby?  A little upset that's the fucking record.  Jimmy?  Team Weeby?  I don't comment on Team Weeby until I know what I'm commenting on because that would make 
[02:03:30]  me seem like a fool.  Anthony knows what this is about.  Team Weeby?  No.  What?  No.  Come on.  Danny?  Team Weeby?  It's tough.  I'm split.  Between who?  I'm very split between Weeby and Mitchell.  You've got to go with the man.  Billy Mitchell.  Billy Mitchell's the man.  He's about America.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Do you know?  Let me tell you something you might not know.  Hold on.  Before you get into that.  Team Mitchell?  He has no clue.  Are you talking about the Donkey Kong guy?  Of course.  Yes, of course we are. 
[02:04:00]  Team Mitchell or Team Weeby?  Simple question.  Do you know what...  I would have to go with Team Mitchell.  All right.  Go ahead, Dan.  I'm sorry.  No, no.  I was just saying Jesus.  I'm looking at an amazing ass over here.  Do you know what Billy Mitchell puts on the machine, Opie, when he gets high score?  Well, when we play, what do you do?  I got the audio.  I know you do.  I just can't help but hear him say that shit.  This is why I can't be Team Mitchell.  This is the reason right here. 
[02:04:30]  I often have people ask me what my handle is, what my three initials are.  I mean, come on.  I tell people, look at me.  Look at him.  What do you think my three initials were?  F-A-G.  If you don't know, you're not looking hard enough.  T-I-E.  T-I-E?  No.  Which one was I wearing yesterday?  America.  USA.  USA.  So I had Latin friends and I had Canadian friends and I always had to keep the Americans 
[02:05:00]  on top.  What an ass.  Thank you, Jimmy.  He's just an absolute ass.  That's why I'm happy to report that Mr. Weeby has the current Donkey Kong record.  Team Weeby all the way.  I think he's a pussy, too.  He didn't want to challenge that last guy.  I think he's a pussy.  Team fucking Weeby.  Anybody but Billy Mitchell.  Steve Weeby reclaims Donkey Kong record from Billy Mitchell.  Why, did Billy want it back?  Oh, yeah, he did.  Yeah.  It's going back and forth.  Only like a few weeks ago. 
[02:05:30]  It's been a very exciting month of Donkey Kong.  Oh, so Billy is still a great player.  Very exciting.  It's going back and forth.  It's crazy.  But he is submitting tapes.  You know, tape scores.  I don't think he's played live too much.  I know he has, but he hasn't played too much.  A lot of these scores that he submits are on tapes.  But they're legit.  Apparently, yeah.  Who's the other guy?  Who's the guy that watches the tapes?  Oh, Robert Mirzak.  Yeah.  Have you ever watched his documentary?  I've been to Where's Beach.  I've been to the arcade where they have the Hall of Fame. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, fun spot.  Fun spot.  I go there all the time, at least once or twice a year.  Is that Rhode Island or?  No, it's in New Hampshire.  New Hampshire.  Where's Beach, New Hampshire.  Okay.  And the Wall of Fame on every game, like Tempest, there's a champion.  And it's pretty much just a wall of pedophiles.  That's all it is.  If you look at the photos of these guys,  it's guys with just their slacks and a thin belt,  and the belt is pulled up way too high with a button-down shirt  and fucking just shitty hair.  That guy's exactly who you think he is. 
[02:06:30]  That's exactly like that.  Those guys.  Danny loves that guy because he has to watch the tapes.  Someone's got to watch the tapes.  He's a horrible name.  When Bob Kelly goes on a two-day nibble performance,  somebody's got to watch all those tapes.  He's got the police down.  A two-day nibble.  Can we hear him?  Yeah, absolutely.  How do you say his name?  Robert Mirzak.  Mirzak.  His whole job is people mail him tapes from all over the world,  and they're just stacked up in his shitty apartment,  and that's all he does is watch them.  But it has to be on VHS because he doesn't have a fucking DVD player. 
[02:07:00]  So you've seen the documentary, Bob?  Oh, I fucking love it.  Do you think he gets sick of these games?  It's literally the best documentary ever made, I think.  It's just great.  Especially since no one plays these games anymore, really.  They suck arcade games.  Oh, they go up to the fucking Where's the Beach, dude.  They have all the fucking games.  It's unbelievable.  They fucking...  They're busy.  A top floor of just shit games.  And they're 25 cents, too, which is ridiculous.  Yeah, I'll give you three for a buck or something, you know?  I hate Jim.  Bobby, really? 
[02:07:30]  When I have to watch that pile of eight tapes over there  for Dwayne Richards' two-day nibble performance,  that's 48 straight hours of paying attention  to make sure that he's doing everything correctly.  Package from the Metroid team in Brazil.  Some Atari 2600 records.  Got to watch that.  These things take time to verify.  And I have to look at every single one of these.  Like I showed you over here,  this is just 200 videotapes.  That's nothing.  This is the real stuff that I have to do.  I see world records in my room  set just about every single day. 
[02:08:00]  Look, let's pause it right there.  Some people think of world records.  Wait, his fucking...  No, wait, go back a little bit.  His room is awful.  He's...  48 hours of nibbler?  Nibbler.  You asshole?  His life is wasted.  It's his OCD.  Get somebody else.  This is his OCD.  Yeah, you might be right, dude.  But at least he's getting something out of his OCD.  What is he getting?  Look at his T-shirt.  Look at his...  Yeah, that's the best part.  He has a fucking official Total Recall 2003 trailer T-shirt. 
[02:08:30]  He watched 48 hours of Nibbler?  I don't even know what Nibbler is.  Of course you don't.  Neither do I.  You don't?  No!  I thought I...  Oh, yeah, all right.  Dude, why not hire an assistant?  No one else wants to...  Because he's a volunteer.  Yeah, he...  He's a volunteer.  He's a volunteer.  He paid for that?  No.  He volunteers, because no one else wants to do that job.  God, what a fucking zilch.  That's Nibbler.  Nibbler is like a centipede and Pac-Man.  Yeah, I guess we all thought how obvious that was. 
[02:09:00]  We're fucking geniuses.  We were trying to beat each other to the genius.  I know.  We both thought we had something.  I can't wait until he dies.  It could have been more obvious what it is.  Nibbler.  I can't...  I never heard of Nibbler, man.  I never heard of Nibbler, but some people wouldn't play it in the arcade.  It's a basketball game by Atari.  The spelling error.  Yeah.  As he makes a skyhook with a snot rag.  If this guy died, those tapes would just get thrown out by his mom. 
[02:09:30]  World's record.  Who tapes themselves for 48 hours?  How do you do that without fucking your game up?  Can we hear more of this guy?  I have no idea.  Robert Mirzak?  Yeah, I might be Team Mirzak.  Can we?  Fuck Weeby and Mitchell.  This is the real deal.  You like him, Danny?  I love him.  I love him, and I forget the guy's name.  The guy in King of Kong that talks about playing Marble Madness.  How he has a glove.  It's a workout glove.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because he doesn't want to get Marble Hand, they call him.  You get Marble Hand.  It's crazy.  I haven't seen the movie in a while. 
[02:10:00]  Who is this fucking...  It's when you play with your friend's balls, too.  Too long.  You get Marble Hand.  Faggot.  Who is the asshole that walks around the arcade and alerts everyone?  I'll find a thing.  And what did he say?  Do you remember the line?  I just said, there's a...  A kill screen.  A Donkey Kong kill screen.  Coming up.  If you're interested.  I don't know what I do.  We've got to find that guy.  Anyone who walks over because they're interested should just be shot by the government.  Let's hear this guy.  Hang on.  This Total Recall t-shirt.  Coming out loud tonight. 
[02:10:30]  There we go.  World records in my room set just about every single day.  Some people think a world record is what's set at the Olympics or at the end of a baseball season.  I see this every single day.  And not just sometimes once.  It's exciting.  Derek!  You stop it!  Boring!  He's watching Steve Weeby do Donkey Kong.  I like you good.  You stop it! 
[02:11:00]  Who's screaming in the background?  This poor kid's on fire.  Kid's just drinking Drano.  Weeby's fucking...  Shut up!  That's the best part of this is that the kid...  Weeby's kid wants his dad to wipe his ass because he just took a shit.  But he's about to break the Donkey Kong records.  That's why you've got to be Team Weeby, by the way.  He's doing these records in front of screaming kids.  What does Mitchell got?  Yeah, really?  A hot sauce company to run.  A what? 
[02:11:30]  A hot sauce company.  Oh, that's true.  He does have his hot sauce.  He's a fucking idiot.  You want to hear more of Mitchell?  Derek!  There's nothing more of Mirzak, I don't think.  That's all we get from him in the whole documentary?  There might be a little more.  There's another documentary called Chasing Ghosts, where it's kind of like King of Kong,  but without all the fun drama that made it so good.  But it's more to the point, but there's more Mirzak audio in that documentary.  Oh, he's in that one, too?  Yeah.  Where does he live?  You know what?  I don't know.  Who's the referee that actually has a referee shirt that he wears?  Oh, God, the referee. 
[02:12:00]  That's Derek's favorite.  What an ass.  Derek likes the referee?  And his awful fucking...  Walter Day and his awful, terrible folk music.  These people are just idiots.  Come on, you don't like folk music?  Didn't he have to retire or something?  Actually, he just did retire.  Yeah.  Hopefully for some health reasons.  Hopefully he had a fucking lump under both arms.  Hopefully because of an incident.  Yeah.  At the arcade.  Yeah, something with stage four in it.  That's right.  The guy that I was talking about with Marble Hand, that guy's name is Mark  Alpiger, so I think if you just put that into YouTube, you'll find some clips of him. 
[02:12:30]  And the guy who announces the Donkey Kong kill screen is Brian...  I think it's pronounced Kuh, but it's spelled K-U-H.  Who's the referee?  What's his name?  Walter Day.  Oh, Walter Day.  John Affiliate, the guy that has to watch the tape, sounds like Club Soda Kenny.  And Rupert Pupkin.  Dude, to watch a 48-hour...  Nibbler performance.  Do you want to say that's two consecutive days of Nibbler?  And you can't fast forward, I would assume, right?  No, you've got to watch the whole thing. 
[02:13:00]  You've got to make sure it's legit.  You think he's OCD, though?  That's a good point.  He might be.  Of course he is.  Has to be.  Has to be.  Of course he is.  That's his thing.  Huh.  You guys want to meet Mark Alpiger?  Oh, boy, do I.  Please.  Help, please.  Well, some people call me Pigger.  Mark Alpiger.  Pigger.  Oh, Pigger.  No one is calling him that.  That's a little nickname.  I don't like that that much, but I don't dislike it either.  And by the way, there's something for you.  I abbreviate.  I don't know if these guys abbreviate. 
[02:13:30]  Like, it's not Marble Madness.  It's Marble.  It's not Crystal Castles.  It's Crystal.  It's not Paperboy.  It's Paper.  I don't know.  Do you say Paper or do you say Paperboy?  Well, my title, of course, is Crystal Castles.  I think I'm going to die here.  I need the hat.  Crystal Castles is where you control a bear, as dumb as that sounds.  Normally, I'd describe a game like that as gay, but it's a kick-ass game.  It's one of the few games that has an ending, especially that early. 
[02:14:00]  It's like, I want an ending.  No, we want the game to go on and on so players can play, and new quarters won't come in the  machine, idiots with suits and their low brain power.  I'm a late bloomer.  I think we talked about this before.  The neat thing is, today's my birthday.  I'll eat into that.  In 83, I was 20.  Today, I turn 43.  Oh, yeah.  I noticed that earlier, and I've noticed that I didn't mention it to you guys.  This is actually technically a weightlifting glove, because I discovered in the 80s that 
[02:14:30]  you could buy a weightlifting glove, which was fingerless, and I used it to play Marble  Madness.  See the double padding?  The guys that played Marble, they used to call it a Marble hand.  You would get calluses.  You would get pinches.  You'd get bruising from the pinches.  You'd get AIDS.  And so I said, you know, this is nuts.  I'm going to get a glove and protect my hand when I played Marble.  Marble.  That's Marble Madness for you people out there.  The layman.  Occasionally, I play Marble Madness.  I use this to avoid the calluses.  He abbreviates.  Dude, that is so... 
[02:15:00]  Certain joystick games.  Do you understand?  Again, if you had to write an ass...  That's the purpose of the glove.  Yes.  Yes.  The top is breathable, so your hand doesn't get hot.  Here, you can do Marble Madness, trackball all day long.  Ain't going to do jack other than make the glove black.  Ain't going to do jack.  So that's the purpose of the glove, and I'm not sure very many people who wear it, but  back in the 80s, they sold gloves like this, probably for like 20 bucks or some rip-off.  What a worthless conversation.  He's really into talking about it.  It's a valueless conversation.  Why don't we take a plane ride to where he is, go to when he's on a game, and just beat 
[02:15:30]  the shit out of him?  Or put fucking crazy glue on his glove.  How about on the ball?  Oh, yeah.  Showing off plane worth...  You know, the low brain power.  Anybody who says low brain power, this is just a dumb way to say it.  ...of the suits that make the game.  Yeah, low brain power.  I'm sure a guy in a suit makes a shit game like that.  Everyone's calling about Donkey Kong.  A lot of people have seen this documentary.  Matt in Minnesota.  Matt.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  That Robert guy that watches all those videos was down in Fairfield, Iowa. 
[02:16:00]  Of course he does.  Iowa.  Iowa.  Yeah, he's got a storefront and everything that's got the name of his business, but nobody's  ever around.  I've drove past it two or three times.  But what's his...  If he does this for free, what's his business?  Um, whatever he does to certify the score, if he has a storefront.  Okay.  I would do that for a living, but I would charge $200 an hour.  Then I'll watch you a fucking 48-hour Nibbler performance.  You cunt. 
[02:16:30]  Nibbler.  I played Nibbler for 48 hours.  Wow.  Should you be killed?  People saying the documentary's on Netflix for free.  Check it out.  It's unbelievable.  It really is.  I understood the 80s.  The early 80s, dude.  I was obsessed.  83, 84.  I told you 81 was a big year for video games.  I was on the paper.  You were in the paper for video games?  Yeah, I was.  For what?  The 80s was in the paper.  I played Asteroids for 10 hours.  It wasn't a world.  And we got a local champion right in front of us.  Did you have a glove? 
[02:17:00]  Local champion, Bob Kelly.  No, I didn't.  But I might have a picture of it.  In the paper.  You were the champion of what?  The paper.  The paper.  Just local paper.  It was Super Bowl Sunday, 81, the 49ers and Bengals.  But were you the champion of New Brunswick?  North Brunswick.  Yeah, I was the local champion.  North Brunswick champion right here, Bobby.  Yeah.  I actually played the game karate.  Remember karate?  It's not about me playing the paper.  For 40 minutes.  Which is also your favorite cologne.  Gives a shit.  Did you fucking...  By the way, Bobby Kelly. 
[02:17:30]  Yes, sir.  Bobby Kelly, Bobby Kelly.  I was watching Louis C.K.'s show.  Yes, sir.  And it was the one where he talks about the divorce, and he's sitting in the diner across  from you.  Uh-huh.  And you are, of course, his brother.  Yes, sir.  And you are very good in that.  Oh, thank you, man.  I was watching that, and I'm just laughing because it pops on, and every episode I'm  like, ah-ha, look, it's Jimmy.  Ah-ha, it's fucking DiPaolo.  Ah-ha, look, it's Bobby.  But you're sitting there, and you give a look at one point of sadness because your brother's 
[02:18:00]  getting divorced and everything like that.  He's divorced.  And you look at him, and you have crumbs from the sandwich all over your lips.  And I'm watching, going like, I don't know if that was written, if Bobby's just a slob,  or if Louie told him to do that or something.  But it looked so authentic.  You're just sitting there looking at him all sad with crumbs in your mouth. 
[02:18:30]  It was fantastic.  Thank you.  You did a very good job, too.  Thank you very much, dude.  Very believable.  I wasn't taken out of the whole show because I know Bob Kelly.  Right, right.  No, it was very good.  Thanks, dude.  I appreciate that.  It was good.  That's the first compliment I've got on the show from Anthony.  Ever, ever.  From Anthony.  Don't expect a lot more to fly in, either.  He's a one compliment per millennium guy.  I've complimented you on your shitty fucking Call of Duty fucking knifing me. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, I miss those days.  Thanks for the knifing, asshole.  I just miss Anthony hiding behind a barrel.  Oh, just getting stabbed and shot.  Kunk.  Oh, Dane Cook with his stupid knifing everybody.  I'd be sitting there ready to hit somebody right in the crosshairs and just hear, whoosh,  whoosh, whoosh.  And I'm dead.  And you just, you turn around the guy when you're dead and you just see Dane Cook running  away with his dumb knife.  Nothing better than actually making somebody quit a game.  It was so infuriating. 
[02:19:30]  I would just be complaining.  All you'd hear is me on mic going, fuck shit, I got killed again.  I suck at this fucking game.  It stinks.  And fuck a Dane with his knife.  You're a cunt.  Fuck you, Dane.  That was me the entire time playing.  And throwing out racial epithets.  Yeah, but that's when you were happy, actually, winning.  Yes.  Exactly.  You weren't mad at that point.  You were like, yes!  That was happy.  Did you see me kill that 12?  Well, yeah, shit. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, shit.  Hi, Sam.  Oh, hi, Sam.  Sam's visiting the studio right now.  Sam talked to Billy Mitchell, really?  Billy Mitchell announces his last world record on special delivery.  What?  No way.  Well, that was when he set the world record last month.  He's in the special delivery Celebrity Friends Club.  And he called in a special delivery and made the announcement.  No, he didn't.  But now his record is gone because Steve Weeby's got it.  Well, maybe we'll get it. 
[02:20:30]  If Dave can get drunk and call him, we'll get him on the show this week.  Can't we just call him right now?  What else is Billy Mitchell doing?  He doesn't do interviews except Dave leaves him voicemail after.  Dave gets drunk and leaves him.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Dave did that, right.  Why doesn't he do interviews?  Because he's too big.  He's too famous.  But he does your show because Dave leaves drunken messages?  Because Dave gets drunk and fills up his voicemail box.  Does he like that?  No.  But he just started doing the show so the voicemail would stop.  Is he a good, nice guy?  He is as he appears on film. 
[02:21:00]  Billy Mitchell?  Yeah.  Billy Mitchell on Sam's show that he does with Eastside Dave.  Sam and Dave on this fine channel.  Billy Mitchell announces the world record, which was just beaten by Steve Wiebe.  Unfortunately.  But we're going back in time about a month ago.  Brilliant performance tonight by Billy.  Breaking news.  More breaking news from Billy Mitchell on special delivery.  Billy, go ahead.  Yeah.  By the way, Triforce is here.  Quite a few people here.  Boom.  Okay.  Okay.  At 3 o'clock, there was a press conference.  Yes.  All right. 
[02:21:30]  And at the press conference, it was announced,  and there were two video game tapes that were shown.  And those two video game tapes that were shown were two world records that were sent,  that were created last Saturday.  Mm-hmm.  Go ahead.  One world record.  One world record.  Hey, Michael.  Was a new world record set on Donkey Kong.  Wait.  Who said it?  Well, first, what was the record?  It was 1,062,800. 
[02:22:00]  What?  And who set that record?  1,100 points higher than the previous record.  Oh, my God.  Just like when I beat Mr. Weeby's score by 1,100 points.  And who set the new world record?  A guy who's video game player of the century.  Yeah.  And his name is Billy Mitchell.  Yeah!  Billy!  You're the fucking Lee!  Billy!  Billy!  Billy!  Billy!  Why are you guys playing into his horse shit? 
[02:22:30]  Why are you playing into his horse shit?  What do you mean?  Oh, you fucking hype.  I hate this guy.  We got excited.  I want to hang him by his own fucking tie.  This fucking piece of stuff.  Because it sounded like he was going to announce that somebody else set the record,  but then he was just talking about himself in the third person.  It was him.  Weeby's a faggot!  Weeby's a faggot!  Okay, I don't know if slurs are necessary.  Billy fucking sucked and fucked himself.  Billy!  Let me ask you a serious question.  It gets better.  Oh my god.  Oh wait, we have more breaking news then. 
[02:23:00]  Hang on one sec.  Does that have anything to do with Donkey Kong Jr.?  Breaking news!  More, even more breaking news from the Hall of Famer, world record holder, Billy Mitchell.  Mr. Mitchell, go ahead.  So this was Saturday at about 3 p.m.  Yes.  Naturally, there's the usual hugs, kisses, who's tolerant.  Sure.  Right.  A couple of gifts, all that fun stuff that we all look forward to.  Got it.  Second fun.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I turned and I said, one more thing I gotta take care of. 
[02:23:30]  Okay.  Go ahead.  And I started a game with Donkey Kong Jr. and on the first shot, I set a new world record  again.  Yeah!  Billy!  Billy!  Billy!  Billy!  Billy!  Suck my dick!  Suck my dick!  Okay, I don't know about that one.  What the fuck?  The fuck is with you guys?  It's a bizarre show.  But yeah.  Suck my dick.  Suck my dick.  Pretty funny shit, actually.  But Billy Mitchell, yeah.  He's full of himself.  Why do you guys play into that? 
[02:24:00]  Well, I thought you should know that he made the original announcement of setting these  records exclusively on the virus.  Well, can we call him now and tell him that we be?  Well, you'd have to get intoxicated and leave him soon.  Has now beat his record.  Right, right.  You gotta get drunk, leave him messages until he acknowledges.  Can you start calling Billy Mitchell in or what?  I don't get that hammered.  I don't get Eastside Dave hammered.  No.  No.  I wish I could.  Yeah, he really likes to drink.  I would throw up and pass out before I ever get close to Eastside Dave drunk.  Before you'd call celebrities and just leave slurs on their voicemail box. 
[02:24:30]  So Billy Mitchell likes you guys.  Well, here's what happened.  That day, Dave called him while we were on the air several times, and finally he picked  up the phone on his cell phone, and Dave said, hey, it's Dave from Sam and Dave on SiriusXM.  And Billy Mitchell responded with, never heard of you.  Oh, really?  And Dave had to say, well, you've done our show three times before.  He's so famous, dude.  Exactly.  What is it to you? 
[02:25:00]  Exactly.  But he did say, if he was flown first class for him and his family and put up in a hotel,  he would do an in-studio appearance.  Really?  Yes.  He wants first?  That reasonable?  Fucking nobody?  That's completely reasonable.  Exactly.  The guy is a fucking icon.  I do have a clip of him talking about him and his family.  And his family and kids, of course.  Well, but he's very famous.  He talks about his fame.  We got a clip of him talking about how famous he is.  And he's modest, too.  Yes, he is.  He doesn't really, you know, he just says...  He never surrenders. 
[02:25:30]  No.  In the early 1980s, video games were all the rage.  I mean, arcades were everywhere.  Whenever we went somewhere, it was the equivalent of a rock band showing up.  Imagine the publicity of the greatest obsession in the world at the time, video games.  Yeah.  And supposedly the best players in the world were coming.  They were coming to your town.  It was, uh...  It was something where there were groupies.  This absolute asshole.  There were groupies, and he was like a rock star. 
[02:26:00]  He was like the Beatles.  Yeah, exactly.  He was pretty much the John Lennon of video games.  When he showed up, forget about it.  Steve Wiebe is more like a Ringo Starr type.  I hope he is the John Lennon of video games.  You guys have seen the documentary, Jimmy.  I did.  You have seen it?  Okay.  He's an absolute ass.  Yeah, he is.  I think he was just not portrayed in the most positive light.  There are a lot of people who get very jealous of somebody when they're as successful as Billy Mitchell.  Successful, charismatic, talented, just talented. 
[02:26:30]  God-given talent.  Confident.  And an entrepreneur.  Yeah, because when you break it down, like you say, well, anybody can have one talent like video games,  but who else can also take over the hot wing industry?  Exactly.  You know?  It's true.  He sells a hot sauce.  I know.  It's true.  What is his hot sauce called?  First class airfare in a hotel.  Douchebag hot sauce.  Is that what it is?  I think it's, I'm a douchebag hot sauce.  Right?  Right?  No.  First class airfare.  Come on, Danny.  You should know this. 
[02:27:00]  Danny.  It's some...  Ricky's World Famous?  Ricky's.  Yeah, Ricky's.  Ricky's?  Why Ricky's?  I think it was his dad's.  I think we've talked about that with him.  And he's sweet.  He is.  He's kind of sentimental.  Name it after his dad.  It's nice.  He's a great guy.  Someone's saying he's Zoolander.  That's pretty good.  Aaron and me, good job.  What a complete fucking asshole this guy is.  He's an absolute boob.  And he's afraid he can't tick. 
[02:27:30]  By the way, if you did notice, the world record was a taped score.  Even the last world record.  So?  That's what I'm saying.  So what?  Of course it was.  He does like taping scores.  He prefers it.  I thought they fucked with Weeby because he taped his.  They didn't let his in the first one.  Well, I feel like Weeby was probably...  He had some chicanery.  And you don't know about those tapes.  But Billy Mitchell is a guy who's been around the block.  You could trust him.  I'd like to take the biggest bottle of hot sauce and smash it over his head.  And pour it in his pee hole.  And then suck it out. 
[02:28:00]  What?  What?  Whoa.  Hey.  Whoa, what?  And then spit it on some wings.  You know your mic's on, right, Bobby?  Whoa.  This is a mic?  Someone has been to Ricky's restaurant.  Who's Ricky?  The father?  I think so.  But isn't it Bill Mitchell's restaurant?  It is, but the restaurant is called Ricky's.  Danny, help me out here.  You know everything about this damn fucking documentary.  Frank.  Yeah, I...  Hey, Frank.  Oh, Frank was better.  Oh, Frank was better. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, go ahead, Frank.  I've been to Ricky's restaurant after I saw the documentary on Netflix.  Because I live not too far from Hollywood.  How far?  And went in there, real high expectations.  There's not even a piece of shit video game in there.  It's like this shitty bar.  No windows.  And the food was terrible.  I mean, it was terrible.  I would have felt better if he took my money with the gun.  But it was absolutely shit. 
[02:29:00]  And he is an asshole.  That's not good for Billy Mitchell, this guy saying restaurant's not that good.  You know what a horse is, Frank?  It's a pig that don't fly straight.  Listen to me, Tony.  Good one.  Yeah, really.  That's the way to commit.  That's the way to commit.  Hey, Tony.  Hey, Tony.  Who's had an impression of your fucking...  Your cousin Merle?  Merle.  Her womb was dysfunctional.  What time is Mel Tillis in today?  I want to look at his comedy album.  I appreciate you guys beating me up. 
[02:29:30]  Anyway, that definitely sucks.  Hey, dude, let me ask you something.  Can I ask you something?  Hello?  Hello?  He left.  He left.  He left the premises.  He's...  Oh, wait.  He's back.  Go ahead, Bob.  Oh, hello?  Hey, dude.  You there?  Tee hee.  Tee hee hee.  It's magic buttons.  Oh, wait.  He's right here.  I'm not going to fall for that again.  When you're hat backwards, you're crazy.  I know it's going to be a crazy show when you have your hat backwards. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, it's going to be crazy.  Let's get to work.  Crazy.  Let's go to Larry in Connecticut.  Larry.  Good morning, gentlemen.  You're fucking your mother, Larry.  Fuck you.  Hey, I love the show.  You're going to find your dog dead in the hallway, Larry.  Larry.  Sorry.  You crazy animal.  Go ahead.  Now, gentlemen, I wanted to ask you, who is a bigger, embarrassing asshole? 
[02:30:30]  This motherfucker or the...  It's real to me, damn it.  That guy was worse.  Well, yeah.  Yeah, but that's just a fan.  That's a quick one.  That guy's a fan.  And these guys are long-term assholes.  What?  Dolphins go 3-0 this weekend, Oak.  What?  Dolphins go...  Ah.  What?  Go fuck your mother.  Oh, wow.  Oh, my God.  Way to take it overboard.  Way to do the mother jokes. 
[02:31:00]  You know I'm sensitive to my mother.  No, I love you, sir.  Wow.  Have a good day.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  Who's that fat fuck?  Oh, my God.  Dude, you know what?  Stress factory, Bobby.  Stress factory, the 30th, the fucking first, and then the second.  This is the first time I've ever went over months.  Wait, that's next weekend.  I'm doing two months, technically, kind of.  Why don't you go...  Next weekend.  Why don't you come in next week to do this?  Because I have nothing to do.  Okay, that's fine.  And I just like coming in.  But you'll come back next week, too. 
[02:31:30]  I would love to.  We've got to get the shows sold out for Bob Kelly at the Stress Factory in New Brunswick,  New Jersey.  732-545-GO-FUCK-YOURSELF is the phone number.  That's not it.  Yeah, it is.  He changed the number.  You didn't know that.  To go fuck yourself?  Yeah.  732-545-GO-FUCK-YOURSELF.  Really?  Yeah, you start typing that in.  That's what he says to everybody's agents.  Robert Kelly fans on Twitter.  You're going to be there this Thursday, Friday, Saturday?  Not this Thursday. 
[02:32:00]  Oh.  The 30th and the 1st and the 2nd of November.  Oh, we're trying to get Robert...  How do you say his last name again, Danny?  What?  Music.  But he doesn't have a cell phone?  Yeah, we tracked him down.  He lives in Brooklyn, but apparently...  I thought he lived in Iowa.  No, whoever said that was wrong.  He went to work.  Yeah, he sounded like he was kind of a new hooker.  What did he do for a living?  Well, call Best Buy.  Yeah, he's going to be there.  Whoever picked up said that...  How does he go to work when he has to watch a 48...  What is it again?  No, no, he resigned from Twin Galaxies a few years back. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, I didn't know that.  So he doesn't watch all the tapes anymore.  Why?  He resigned?  What would happen?  Some of the...  Who's trusted now to do that?  His house was being foreclosed?  He had to get a job?  Well, there was a lot of controversy surrounding his involvement with Billy and Twin  Galaxies.  Oh, really?  What was the controversy?  Really, what was that?  Well, Billy Mitchell was like the Twin Galaxies poster child.  He was like the big fanboy for Twin Galaxies.  So he was very deeply rooted in this little organization. 
[02:33:00]  So when someone beat his score, they kind of didn't believe it, and they went to Steve  Weeby's house, and they took the inside of his Donkey Kong game.  And apparently, like, you know, they just kind of muscled their way in, this guy Mirzak  and someone else, and said it was fake.  It was a board that had been worked on.  They couldn't accept the score.  It wasn't valid.  Wow.  Was it valid, though?  This documentary is completely insane.  I think it was valid.  No, the board had been worked on.  It was not valid.  But my thing is, why wouldn't you, as Weeby, grab them by the neck and fucking just beat 
[02:33:30]  the...  He wasn't home, nerd.  They came to his house when he wasn't home.  Why didn't his young son do it?  I'm glad we're discussing this again.  Young son in the car.  Because we've had these discussions off-air about this documentary.  Same jokes.  We're obsessed with this documentary.  There was a point in time, probably last year or two years ago, where I was watching  it, like, every other day.  I was just throwing it on, because it was the best thing I'd ever seen.  It was great.  It was a great documentary.  Yeah.  Billy Mitchell's only made one real mistake in his life, and that was answering his online  hot wing orders with his cell phone, because that's how a certain drunk Eastside Dave got 
[02:34:00]  his cell phone number.  Oh, really?  Oh, wow.  Billy Mitchell called him to confirm the order with his cell phone, and so Dave left a drunk  message saying he wanted to buy, like, a thousand bottles of hot sauce.  Yeah.  He asked for a ton of hot sauce when he was drunk, and called the 1-800 number.  And Billy Mitchell called him back?  On his cell phone.  And so Dave ordered four bottles of hot sauce and saved his phone number.  Fucking Dave is great. 
[02:34:30]  How was the hot sauce?  Dave didn't share.  He's a selfish person.  What, did he put some up his asshole?  Spread it on his balls?  What did he do?  I don't know what he did with it.  It is comfortable in his home.  Put it in the hat, and then shit in the hat, and then put the wings in and shook it.  Did you say November follows September?  No.  Bob Tobinus.  It's my birthday.  Jeff and Jersey.  Hey, Bobby, when does November?  November's actually after October.  I don't know what you're listening to, dude.  I am. 
[02:35:00]  I mean, seriously.  Unless you have Rewind on that, and you can prove that on the air, I fucking don't know  what you're talking about.  You diffused that one very well.  You got out of that.  Hey, why don't we go to break?  September October's first.  Will you explain this Bob Kelly rap?  Oh, yeah.  Bob Kelly was rapping, and one of the interns.  It was horrible.  Whoa.  Oh.  Oh, dude.  You can't spit like me.  Don't fucking talk about something.  Because your hat's backwards.  Oops.  Fucking A.  Dude, I spit.  I freestyle, man.  Put your hat on backwards.  I can't. 
[02:35:30]  I can't.  I can't.  Oh, my God.  Because it's...  Look, it happened.  I took it off.  Let's ruin your hat.  The hat got ruined.  Let's ruin your hat.  It's a flex fit.  The hat.  The hat.  Put the hat on backwards.  It's very...  It's too hot.  It doesn't look good on backwards?  I think hair actually air-conditions your head.  Head.  Yeah.  What?  Because my head's hotter now that I don't have the hair.  Yeah?  It's fucked up.  I think the hair absorbs sweat. 
[02:36:00]  Or it absorbs it.  Or maybe it just wipes away shit from the fucking pores so they could sweat more.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Wicks it away.  Wicks it.  It's natural wicker.  Wicks it away.  Yeah.  Thank God for eyebrows.  We got an intern named Ray.  Who's Ray?  Ray.  He's George Harrison.  You could call him Ray.  You could call him Jay.  You could call him Johnny.  You could call him Ray J. Johnny.  But you doesn't have to call him Johnson. 
[02:36:30]  It's a funny bit that could be...  Oh, was that funny for fucking...  What is that?  ...20, 30 years.  That's creepy.  Whoa!  You could call me Ray.  You don't know it?  What is that?  You never heard the Ray bit?  Bob has to hear it.  I don't understand where it is.  Ray J. Jimmy Johnson.  Find Ray J. Johnson.  This was all the rage for...  Find him on YouTube.  He's got to be there.  It's got to be the A's.  You need commercials.  This was hysterical in the 70s.  Was it 70s?  Everyone, all my relatives, the old relatives would laugh, and I'd be like, why the fuck  is this guy funny? 
[02:37:00]  His whole gimmick was you could call me Ray, you could call...  Oh, this is...  Bush natural light.  Just say natural.  You see, you doesn't have to call it Anheuser-Busch natural light, and you doesn't have to call  it Anheuser natural, and you doesn't have to call it Bush natural.  Just say natural.  Johnson's right.  Oh, you can call me Ray, or you can call me Jay, or you can call me...  For a great-tasting light beer, just say natural.  That was a shtick.  You don't have to call me Johnson.  Two naturals, please.  Please don't ask him his name. 
[02:37:30]  James, you can call me Ray, or you can call...  Is there a bit, like, is there him doing an actual...  Hey!  Oh!  You'd be like, hey, Ray.  You can call me Ray.  But she doesn't have to call me Cuntface.  Is that him on top, like the first one?  I don't know.  Or is that...  Wait, let's see.  I wish I started comedy.  You know how easy it was to get famous back then?  I know.  Oh, you don't have to call me Johnson.  My name is Raymond J. Johnson Jr. 
[02:38:00]  Now, you can call me Ray.  Or you can call me Jay.  Or you can call me Johnny.  Or you can call me Sonny.  Or you can call me Jenny.  Or you can call me Ray J.  Or you can call me RJ.  Or you can call me RJJ.  Or you can call me RJJ Jr.  But you doesn't have to call me Johnson.  That's his whole...  Hold on, hold on, hold on. 
[02:38:30]  Let me explain, though.  Yeah.  That was popular in, like you said, probably the 70s.  That was a very recent video.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's now a really old man, and he felt like he needs to have this on YouTube.  And it doesn't sound as good as it used to.  He's like, dude, you can call me Ray.  Ray J.  But you doesn't have to crack my head.  Yeah.  You can call me...  That hurt my eye.  ...Janny.  You can call me Ray J.  Jenny.  You can call me an ambulance, because the right side of my arm is numb. 
[02:39:00]  You can call me Ray J. Jr.  He stinks, but you doesn't have to call...  You doesn't have to change my diapers on the way to radiology.  Radiology.  Radiology.  I get it.  Ray J. Jr.  I'll tell you, a gunshot should go off before he finishes that.  Hey, Ray.  Ray J. Jr.  You want to do it? 
[02:39:30]  Yes.  We can do a little theater.  Okay.  We got the gunshot.  You want to do it?  We're racing.  You want to do it for the people?  I think so.  I would like to...  Oh, I think I see one right there.  Okay.  Let's do a little theater.  A little O&A theater starring Jim Norton.  O&A theater.  O&A radio theater.  Here we go.  Jimmy's even standing up for his part.  Sponsored by...  Anthony, when I want you to shoot, I'll go like this.  All right.  You do that.  A good visual.  Nice.  Okay.  Does someone else have to say, hey, Ray?  Good visual.  Bobby, you want to do the hey, Ray part? 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, I'd love to.  What is my lines?  Hey, Ray.  That's all you have to do.  All right.  Stand up, please.  Oh, wait.  No.  Hey, Johnson.  I can't believe we got that wrong.  Hey, Johnson.  Oh, is it?  Hey, Johnson.  All right.  Ready?  Are you going to yell action?  I'll do action.  Okay.  And action.  Hey, Johnson.  I touched Bob's penis.  He just grabbed Bobby's balls.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  All right.  We're not going to get it right.  We're not going to get it right the first time. 
[02:40:30]  It's okay.  He's okay.  He falls and went, meh.  It's okay.  All right.  Ready?  We're going to try it again.  Bobby's the hey, hey, Johnson.  All right.  Let's try it again.  All right.  Now, don't grab my bones.  All right.  He won't.  He won't.  And action.  Hey, Johnson.  Hey, Johnson.  It never gets out.  Okay.  Let's try it again.  How about this one?  I think Anthony panicked.  Yeah, I did.  You have to wait for the point.  He saw a finger. 
[02:41:00]  Okay.  All right.  Let's try it again.  He panicked like he would in real life.  All right.  Bobby, I did.  Excuse me, sir.  Bam.  Wow.  Then he opens the door for him.  Here.  Take care, sir.  I got this.  I'm going to throw you a curveball here.  Okay.  What are you going to do?  Steal some money?  Okay.  Come on in.  We're going to improv this one?  Yeah, I'm going to throw him a curveball.  You're the Hey, Johnson guy.  All right.  Okay.  Here we go.  And action.  Hey, Johnson.  Hey!  See, I hit him on the head with a shovel.  Fuck.  And then he falls into a lake. 
[02:41:30]  And then a dolphin gets him.  But you doesn't have to call me Flipper.  You can fuck my blowhole.  You can kill me in a tuna net.  But she doesn't have to call me Flipper.  Let's say hi to Susan on one hand.  You can call her, cunt.  I missed.  Susan's got something on the Ray Guy. 
[02:42:00]  Susan.  Hey, it was back in the 70s when I heard this.  The first time I heard it, my family thought it was hilarious that I realized they were all retarded.  And I was the only normal one in the family.  You didn't find it funny?  What's your name?  Suzanne.  You can call her Susie.  You can call her Suzanne.  But she doesn't have to give her a hysterectomy.  Thank you.  I prefer not to have one.  But thank you for offering.  Yeah, I don't understand people that found that funny now or back in the 70s. 
[02:42:30]  There's a Johnson song for the 70s.  That's right.  Oh, you can call me gay.  You can call me gay.  You can call me gay.  You can call me gay.  But she doesn't have to call me for work.  I love Steve.  Too soon.  Too soon.  He's my friend.  I talked to him yesterday, actually.  Oh, my gosh.  I can't tease my friend.  Oh, my gosh. 
[02:43:00]  He's on an unemployment line.  You can call me gay.  He's got a baby, man.  I'm sure he will.  Yeah, let's hear some hooks in the water.  Does he?  Hooks in the water?  Is that what they call him?  All right.  Why don't we play the Johnson song from the 70s?  But you doesn't have to let me suck your Johnson.  You can call me stupid.  That's the end of the song.  That just ends there.  Just that's it.  You can.  All right.  Thank you, Kenny. 
[02:43:30]  All right.  Here's the Johnson song.  You can call.  This is the song.  Here's the Ray J. Johnson song.  Oh, fuck.  Strap in.  This is going to be awful.  It's not.  Novelty song.  Disco.  Disco.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I'm getting a deuce chill already.  Hold on.  I can't watch.  This is funny.  My money is to love this guy.  Oh, no.  Yeah. 
[02:44:00]  Dancing, dancing, dancing, Johnson, Johnson.  Oh, no.  This is Dancing Roddy.  Dancing, Johnson.  Roddy did a song like this, too.  Ray J. Johnson, Jr.  Oh, my God.  Oh, fuck.  I can't. 
[02:44:30]  Yes.  I like noise.  Dancing.  Oh, shit.  He just wants to boogie.  He just wants to boogie.  Dancing, dancing, dancing, Johnson, Johnson, Johnson.  When does he go into the You Can Call Me Ray?  Johnson.  I want to shoot myself to this at a New Year's Eve party.  Oh, you can call me Ray. 
[02:45:00]  There he goes.  Or you can call me Jay.  But you doesn't have to call me Johnson.  Yeah, that's funny.  You can call me RJ.  Or you can call me JJ.  But you doesn't have to call me Johnson.  You can call me Ray.  My name is Raymond J. Johnson, Jr.  You can call me Johnson.  You can call me Jay.  You can call me Junior.  You got a little pointing to it.  Oh, this is tall.  Yeah, point to the crowd. 
[02:45:30]  This is nice.  Turn it off.  Come on.  And let the boogie master get out on me.  The boogie master.  This is so fucking bad.  This is the Bull Turkey.  You can call it AIDS.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  I love the dancing Johnson. 
[02:46:00]  Yes.  And my tonsils are the dance floor.  Dancing, dancing.  Dancing Johnson.  Everybody.  This is great.  Or nobody.  I hope there's more of a good routine in this.  Oh, you can call me Ray.  You can call me Jay.  Yeah.  You can call me Junior.  Junior.  And that'll help you sooner.  But you don't have to call me Johnson. 
[02:46:30]  Help me sooner?  What does that mean?  You can call me Sonny.  But look here, honey.  You don't have to call me Johnson.  You don't have to call me Johnson.  You can call me Ray.  My name is Raymond J.  And Johnson is the junior.  They call you Sonny.  You can call me Jay.  You can call me Ray.  You can call me Ray.  You don't have to call me Johnson.  Can we turn this off?  No.  I'm trying to dance here.  Yes. 
[02:47:00]  These backup singers had to do this.  What else are they doing?  Cocaine.  Getting AIDS.  Let's hope.  Oh, you can only hope.  I never trust Ray J.  I never like him.  I told you a long time ago not to fuck me,  Sonny Ray J. Johnson Jr.  Man of law, I wants to boogie some more.  He wants to boogie some more.  To boogie. 
[02:47:30]  I wants to.  He talks like he just scalded the inside of his mouth.  Hot cum.  Dancing Johnson.  Da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha.  Let's go to Todd in Detroit.  Todd, what's going on?  A new look.  Good evening.  Hi, Todd.  What do you got?  A new look.  Todd, go ahead.  What do you got for the show?  What's up, Todd?  You.  How you doing, Todd?  What do you got, man?  What's up, Todd?  How you doing?  Let's go. 
[02:48:00]  How are you, buddy?  Go.  Bob Kelly.  I just want to tell you something.  Todd, stop listening to your radio and just say what you got to say.  Probably the only reason why these douchebags still have a job is because you come on their  show periodically and freshen up there.  Thank you.  I was saying the same thing just the other day.  I said, thank God for Bob Kelly or we would just be completely fucked.  Dude, are you going to see Bob in Marco Island, Florida this Thursday, Friday, Saturday?  Well, that's me, actually.  No, me.  No.  No, I can't leave the state of Michigan.  I'm on parole. 
[02:48:30]  For what?  Bad phone call.  Felony bad phone call.  Yes.  For impersonating somebody with a sense of humor.  Hey, you can call him douchebag.  Counterfeit interesting.  See, because it's not real.  Oh, all right.  Because he's not interesting at all.  It's fake, you know.  I didn't hear you.  Go on and fuck me, Ray J.  You want to fuck me, Ray J?  You can't stand for Sonny or Johnson Jr. to be touching me. 
[02:49:00]  Say hello to Ray J, Johnny Johnson Jr.  Oh, the tigers.  Awful montage.  Oh, the hate of the montage.  Didn't you?  What was the song for the Scarface montage?  You could call it a clock without a 12.  Oh, God.  This is great dance music.  Love this one.  Ray J. Johnson, Jimmy Johnson.  Ray J. Johnson.  He should be doing his fucking Ray J song at the Babylon Club. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, yeah.  The cigar and the tiger's roar.  I love when him and Tony are laughing on the phone.  We've done this break already, but...  And then you'll cut his throat, right?  I've killed 20 people, Tony.  It's probably like a fun joke.  And then my son spilled his milk.  I hope you're cleaning up.  They're laughing. 
[02:50:00]  Then they ship off poison.  Laundering bags of money.  Vans.  Who wouldn't arrest this guy just walking down the street with that hat?  All I want to do is listen to this song.  It's great.  I like it on GTA.  This is a good one.  They're caving in fucking hook his skulls to this one.  It's like Anthony's dance.  I'm doing that springy chair dance.  I like it.  This is a tiger.  It's like you're a marionette. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  I'm opening up a hair salon for my sister with her big fucking stupid hair.  Oh, she is.  She wants to fuck me at the end.  That's great, man.  I want to go to a hair salon with a woman with a big 70s muff in her head.  Exactly.  Watch over with her one-ups team.  She just needs a mouth guard.  She's got a football helmet.  And Ernie the pig is there.  Trying to smell her seed after she gets off the toilet.  And Michelle Pfeiffer having her womb hosed off. 
[02:51:00]  It's polluted.  Because it's so fucking polluted.  And they're carrying bags of fucking...  They're probably carrying giant bags of Ray J. Johnson records.  They have a bank.  I want to launder my Ray J. Johnson albums.  Yeah, I want to see if you can filter them and make them funny.  Tony sold cocaine, but only to buy Ray J. Johnson Jr. records.  And then he marries his sweetheart.  She was pretty in this.  I kill a communist for fun.  But I come up Ray J. Jr. really nice for a green card. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, and then they show in this one, he's kissing the bride.  And Manny is looking at his wife.  Yes.  Looking at her.  And she looks at him.  We're going to do this.  And then Tony's going to shoot you.  Yes.  Hope I didn't spoil it for anybody out there.  Then he blows on her hair.  Because it's like one of those little flowers he's expected to blow on.  She's giving him a sexy look like, you want to marry me?  Oh, look.  Here's the tiger.  It's her gift.  Oh, it's nice.  It takes her to the toilet. 
[02:52:00]  What trash.  It takes her to the toilet.  Tent to the toilet?  There's not even a tent.  What a bunch of immigrants.  Fucking street tables.  Horrible party.  They go down to the stinky swamp and look at the poor tiger.  Yeah.  Chained up to a one foot chain.  How great would it be if it got loose?  Oh, I'd love that.  Watch him eat fucking little midget Al Pacino.  Yeah.  Oh, he has little lips.  Get to the limit.  He had some fucking cat food on his lips.  And the tiger attacked him. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, there you go.  Isn't she killed in that dress?  Oh, no.  It's a robe she's wearing.  Who the fuck knows?  She didn't age well.  Get to the limit.  The fucking sister.  What's her name?  She looks like shit.  Yeah, yeah.  The last thing she was really in was like Perfect Storm.  She was the chick captain on the other ship.  Yeah.  You're going into the eye of the monster.  The belly of the bee.  It was like what a douche chill moment that was.  Was it bad?  Shut up.  I don't remember that.  You old somatic shite. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, she was.  Terrible.  You're going into the belly of the bee.  Turn her up, Billy.  Turn her up.  Shut up.  How great was her fucking shooting in school?  Why don't you just fuck me, Tony?  Yeah.  That guy gave her a gunning down.  Oh, did he plow her right down?  He missed Tony completely.  What a lousy shot.  That's right there.  That's a nice set, huh?  That's some redeeming quality right there.  No wonder fucking Manny fucked her.  Yeah.  We were married just yesterday.  Oops.  Sorry.  What great nipple. 
[02:53:30]  Blue Manny away.  We're going to surprise you.  I like the fade of the nipple.  Oh, that's a nice.  The fade of the areola.  That's a nice fade, right, Bobby?  That's a nice fade.  I like it.  Yeah, my tits, Tony.  She looks like shit.  I love how his mother talked all out of order.  Oh, she was fucking.  At me, she helps.  Take your money.  Drugs.  Dirty for you.  Like Yoda.  Hey, mama.  Hey, mama.  Fucking Cuban Yoda.  Well, you're all right.  Look at her big fucking old lady panties.  I know.  The 70s fucking panties she's wearing. 
[02:54:00]  You could drop a full load in those and nobody would notice.  Oh, by the way, a quick poll.  Who almost shit his pants six times last night?  That's right, folks.  The kid.  The kid.  My diet's been a little odd lately, and I can just feel like if I.  One good cough, and there would have been an issue with Bored to Death.  One good cough.  One good cough, and the fucking.  And I would have had to sneak out.  You're all about the poop. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah, I told everybody that before.  Take it to the limit.  I found a video of that from the seller.  You're in my animation, my massage parlor animation.  That's right.  I'm washing my ass, and then I look, and there's a little worm on the soap, and you go,  I'm all about the poop, and then you jump off the soap.  Oh, all about the poop.  That's what you said earlier.  I remember that.  Oh, my God.  I got to tinkle so bad.  What was the Bob Kelly rap about?  That's where this all started.  We were trying to take a break 40 minutes ago.  Oh, because of Ray.  Intern Ray. 
[02:55:00]  Right.  Slash George Harrison, slash Crispin Glover.  I don't know what he's called yet.  Okay, right on.  But, yeah, he took Bob Kelly's rap, and he put it to some music, and he put some production  behind it.  I think we got a single.  It's good?  A single.  Yeah, I like it.  Get the fuck out of here.  How could it be good?  I know.  Most of the time, these interns come in here with shit.  But, first of all, this is actually good.  Yo, man, don't fucking backwards hat.  He's the one who looks like, fuck with me, backwards hat today.  Bob Kelly's Stress Factory, next weekend, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, we go to break 
[02:55:30]  with the Robert, wow, backwards hat.  Don't fuck with me.  Fuck, now what?  Now what?  Now what?  Now what?  Now what?  Now what?  Maybe we have to battle.  Oh, shit.  Maybe we just get a subject from Ant and fucking Norm, and we battle.  A rap battle?  Yeah.  A rap battle?  Yeah.  Ah, yes.  Fucking, uh...  The old Marley Marle DJ, fucking Marley, uh, DJ Red Alert days at, uh, BLS and KISS.  Good subject.  Fucking, you, you hoopties.  That's great.  Fucking Bash is fucking hooptie, yo. 
[02:56:00]  Yo, man, I don't use that hooptie shit.  That's old.  I use Bucket.  It's called Bucket now.  Bash is Bucket, yo.  It rhymes with more shit.  Mr. Bucket.  Really?  Is that why?  Bucket rhymes with fuck it.  Duck it.  I like it.  We're gonna...  Suck it.  We're gonna play this fucking...  Yes.  Raps are from Intern Ray.  And then we'll do the fucking rap battle after the break.  More with Bob Kelly.  Stay there.  Can you do a little freestyling to end the week here on the opening of the show?  Oh, shit.  We need a new fucking rap, man.  Do you need a beat?  I mean, if you got one, I'll fucking roll with whatever you got. 
[02:56:30]  Yo, yo, yo.  Check it.  Check it.  One, two.  Yo, yo.  Travis is in the booth.  Turn it up, yo.  Turn it up.  I'm Bobby K.  What's up, yo?  Cause it's New York City.  We got no animals.

[02:57:30]  Gah!  Gah!  Gah!  Gah!  Gah!  Gah!  What's up?  I didn't say it, but I said it.  Ding, ding, ding.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  And it's just about to go into the flow of the fucking motherfucking Starbucks Cup of Joe.  The Opie and Anthony show of the virus. 
[02:58:00]  Serious.  XM.  All my life I'm being over the top.  I don't know what I'm doing.  All I know is I don't want to stop.  All fired up.  I'm gonna go till I drop.  No, I'm the hero in the way.  Don't make me.  I don't want to stop.  Opie and Anthony.  There was something I wanted to say, but...  Ah, fuck it.  I forgot what it was.  Bobby's on the phone.  Ant's not even in studio. 
[02:58:30]  Jimmy's on his iPad.  No one's listening to anybody.  Oh, shit.  See, they're just talking over there.  They don't even know what I'm talking about.  I'm in.  I'm in.  I'm in, dude.  Are you back, Bobby?  What is that fucking noise?  What is that fucking noise?  Bob Kelly's Dress Factory next weekend.  Why are you guys whispering?  What's going on?  I just want to do a little lady and a tramp with Norton and a pretzel. 
[02:59:00]  Hey, tomorrow on the show, we got Danny McBride calling in.  Eastbound and down.  Who's that?  Danny McBride.  What's wrong with you?  I fucking love that show.  Well, the show's finally coming back.  I got the first two episodes right in my hand right here.  How long has it been to watch it already?  I'm going to watch it tonight.  Can I have it?  I'm going to be one of the first in America to watch the new Eastbound and Down, so I'm  ready for the big Danny McBride phone call.  Hilarious show.  We love Danny McBride.  Fucking hilarious show.  It's been off the air for a really long time, hasn't it?  More than a year or no? 
[02:59:30]  It has to be more than a year.  It's been more than a year.  It's got to be close to two years, I'm thinking.  Well, he blew up.  He fucking blew up, and I'm glad he's coming back to do a season two.  It was a fucking great show.  One of my favorite shows.  Yeah, absolutely.  I have it on my iPad at all times.  If you haven't checked out Eastbound and Down, you really should.  It's great TV.  Very funny.  Yes.  And that's Will Ferrell produces that with him, right?  I think so.  I think they do a lot of stuff together.  Hilarious.  Hilarious.  Hilarious.  Hilarious.  Oh, Blind Stevie.  That's right. 
[03:00:00]  Can I have those copies when you're done?  I think HBO wants it back.  Yeah, it's supposed to.  But fuck it, yeah, sure, no problem.  Awesome.  We won't tell them.  Just don't tell them.  They won't know.  That's true.  Where do I drop it off?  I'll come pick it up.  Want to come over and watch?  Leave it at your dog.  Oh.  Want to hang out together for once?  Oh.  Do you want to hang out?  Yeah.  Hang out, watch a little Eastbound and Down?  Yeah.  You got like soy chips?  Right.  I got soy chips.  You got almonds?  You don't do soy chips.  I'll do almonds.  What's your snack?  Now?  Yeah.  Cum.  What if that was a snack? 
[03:00:30]  If you could take cum and put it on like a pan and fry it with some honey?  Ew.  Or you just ate it cold out of somebody's hand?  Oh, you don't like when I tell you that you're a cum eater.  No, no.  Remember that?  He didn't like that at all.  Nah.  No, because...  It's too close to home.  I'm going to make you eat cum yummy.  Eat cum.  Cum yummy.  Cum yummies?  Eat cum yummies.  Eat cum yummy.  Eat cum.  Ugh.  Eat yummy cum.  Young captain.  And you lick it off my wrist?  There's some of my wrist.  It was dripping.  It'll always drip a little bit. 
[03:01:00]  Gotta lick it off his wrist.  Be crazy not to.  You ain't great.  Get that to the last drop, you faggot.  That's me licking cum off my hand, but you can't see it.  No, it isn't.  I Twittered it.  No, you didn't.  I jerked off into my hand and I fucking licked cum at this video.  Why?  Who does that?  Why would you do that?  I never, because a girl wanted me to.  What?  Huh?  You have to stop talking to your mom late at night.  Oh, she would lick it off for me.  Oh, God.  You never get me the mother stuff.  The cum licking kid we call her. 
[03:01:30]  That bitch loves to lick cum.  She'd lick a motherfucking cum like nobody.  Let me go to Stedman in Arkansas.  Stedman.  You're really the cum off your hand.  Stedman.  Yeah.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, Opie.  I hate to burst your bubble, man, but the great Ronnie B's had the first,  four episodes of Eastbound for at least two weeks now.  Well, you tell Ronnie B.  Big game, Ronnie B.  You tell Ronnie B, who's going to be on at, what, 11 o'clock today, that I have five episodes. 
[03:02:00]  Five?  Jesus Christ.  One better than Ronnie B.  Make sure the message gets to Ronnie B.  The great Ronnie B.  Not trying.  It just happened.  How many do I have in front of me, Bobby?  You have five.  One, two, three, four, five.  Five.  Is that six?  What's that?  Special edition.  What's the behind the scenes?  I'm saving that for when Ronnie says he has five as well.  Sorry, sorry.  But you tell Ronnie B.  I got five episodes of Eastbound and Down that's coming back to HBO in the very near future.  I have something to say to you, man.  What?  Ron and Fez, 11 to 2.  11 to 2?  What?  Were you on the show? 
[03:02:30]  What happened to the last hour?  Well, I'm in the central time zone.  I don't know how the hell your future time works.  Acting like you're some kind of 11 to 3, maybe?  Something, yeah.  Very good.  You tell Ronnie B., though.  I got five.  He's got four.  I'm one better.  Thank you.  All right.  And the last time Eastbound and Down was on March 22, 2009.  No shit.  Nine.  Nine.  Two thousand nine.  I'm a chick in the show. 
[03:03:00]  Under crystal clear blue sky.  Would you feel her up?  The best tits.  You'd feel her up, right?  God, when they showed her tits at the end.  Oh, my.  The best tits.  Those were stunt tits.  We had a whole discussion about that.  Those can't be.  No, they're not.  That wasn't her tits.  No, they're not.  Stunt tits.  Why?  They're not stunt tits.  We did 20 minutes on that shit.  Don't fucking tell me the stunt tits.  It was so obvious it was.  No, they're not.  We got to do this break again?  No, first of all, I don't fucking care what you say.  They're not stunt tits. 
[03:03:30]  That's his girlfriend in the show, right?  They're not married or anything.  Or were they married?  I forget.  The show hasn't been on for so long.  I don't even remember the story.  I love.  You know what really turns me on is when you don't expect to see tits.  Beautiful, right?  That's not her tits.  Those are her tits.  I'm telling you, that wasn't her tits.  Kazowie.  They show her with the tits.  All right.  Find that picture.  You're not going to find it because they can't do that.  That's not her tits.  Those are her tits.  That's her tits and her bra.  How pretty is she?  Look at the skin.  It's a little loosey right there.  That's because it's mushed in.  Well, they are pretty mushed in.  All right.  Then why don't they show the head? 
[03:04:00]  The head?  The head?  It's not a cock, you faggot.  Why don't they show?  They're only showing her tits without it.  It's an areola.  Why don't they show the tip of it?  That's the dead giveaway.  They're showing the tits without the head.  How come they don't show the p-hole?  How come the helmet isn't in there?  You're dumb, man.  Dude, I'm not dumb.  Those are fucking...  Don't burst my bubble.  The stunt tits, how they do the stunt tits, they only show the tits without the head and the tits.  I bet if you watch the video of it...  Because they're switching out the tits.  Watch the video of it, you can see they connect. 
[03:04:30]  No, there's a cut.  No, there's no cut.  There's a cut.  Find the cut.  Mr. Skin will have it.  Remember that movie with a girl pretending to be the guy...  My head doesn't allow it.  Sorry, Bob.  Crying game.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  It was a rom-com with a girl turning into a guy.  She's really hot in the end.  She's in a tux and then she looks at it and she tries to tell the guy and she opens her tits.  Just one of the guys?  God damn it.  Best tits in the fucking ever in a movie.  Her tits were amazing. 
[03:05:00]  They're fake, by the way.  You made me want to fuck a guy with tits like that.  Oh, please.  You're missing out, dude.  Yeah, because some guy was friends with...  No, no.  Take that off.  The guy...  You want to go $20?  Nope.  What do you want?  Who's got the biggest cock in the room?  Fuck.  I give answers.  Mr. Skin proved that it wasn't her tits.  Someone wants me to kill you for saying rom-com.  Oh, yeah, really?  It was annoying.  I agree with that person.  Yeah, okay.  Whoever that person is, I totally agree with you.  After the show, Anthony, I want you to kill me.  I'm going to say it again. 
[03:05:30]  Rom-com.  So, you have it fresh.  Rom-com.  Yes, rom-com.  What's wrong with rom-com?  Rom-com.  I don't know.  It's like dramality.  Let's go to Larry in Connecticut.  I don't even know if that's right.  Hi, Lawrence.  Larry.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Oh, you know.  Good morning, Bobby.  Hi, sir.  Hey, I wanted to thank you for something that you talked to the guys about a couple of  years ago about your super bidet seat.  Remember that?  Say that again?  Bidet.  Yeah, my bidet seat. 
[03:06:00]  Yes.  Oh, right.  I just had my house remodeled about six months, seven months ago.  Proud of you.  And I bought that seat.  Yes.  Proudy, that is the best fucking thing I ever, ever...  I got two radio shows.  Fucking good for you.  You never have swamp ass again, right?  Never have swamp ass again.  It's a beautiful thing.  A little fan drives you.  Fan drives you.  The heated seat, the heated water.  You still got that thing?  It works great.  What the fuck?  When I go on the road, I'm fucking pissed.  Yeah, you go home.  I sit on the floor.  Wait, wait, wait.  You guys like those tits? 
[03:06:30]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, they weren't bad.  Do you not open your asshole up and get inside your asshole?  Have you taught your asshole, like, muscle how to, like...  No, no, no, the first time you get hit with it, boy, it's a shock.  You look a little low on the chest.  Yeah, what's wrong with you guys?  I got to call you out on that.  That head is superimposed.  Fuck you.  You think they're fucking...  They didn't superimpose back in the 80s.  How long is her chest plate?  There's way too much chest before the boobs start.  I'm noticing that, too.  You know, it might be a weird thing.  Wait a minute.  It's like looking at a Christmas tree where you have to see where there's lights. 
[03:07:00]  If you squint your eyes, it's worse.  Squint your eyes, and then look at...  They're a mile below.  What is wrong with you?  This is longtorso.com.  There is an equal amount of distance from the neck to her nipples as there are from the nipples to her pussy.  Yeah, I like that.  That isn't right.  That's got to be Photoshopped.  You'll run out of spit kissing from her neck to her tits.  Find another picture of it.  Because they're not even saggy.  They're just sticking out way too low.  Find another picture.  Something's gone amiss.  Look at those tits.  I like those tits.  Something fell down.  I want to get a bidet.  Get with this guy's drink at a seat. 
[03:07:30]  What do you want a bidet for?  He said to get my asshole wipes.  Listen to me.  Fuck the wipes.  Yeah, that's all you need.  You don't need the wipes.  You need water up your ass like that.  It cleans it.  Does it really?  Yeah, listen.  How is it going?  Like a fire hose or a water fountain?  No.  It's not going to do anything if you got one of those cakey fucking...  No.  ...train.  Black tar heroin shits.  You get one of those, dude?  It cleans it out.  No.  It breaks it up.  No.  Abso-fucking-lutely.  Really?  It'll break it up.  You get the one that's still left in your asshole a little bit, and it goes up in there 
[03:08:00]  and cleans it out and wets it up and...  And then it just falls out?  Just falls out.  I might want to get one of those.  How much is one of those?  $500.  You don't need one.  They're fake tits.  He's a lunatic.  Those aren't fake tits.  They are!  They're not fake tits.  Those are real.  Those are not her tits.  Those are her tits.  Oh, man.  They fucked it up.  What do you mean?  They fucked up.  You could tell.  Dude, they didn't do, like, fucking...  His head is different.  It's not a his.  No, it's a her, but...  That's not a chick.  They didn't do fucking CGI back then. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, they didn't have CGI.  They didn't have that shit.  It's not CGI.  They're not going to put CGI in a rom-com.  They're not CGI.  They're fake tits.  What do you mean?  They're just, like...  Danny, try to freeze frame or something.  She's wearing something.  She opens up the fucking...  She's not wearing anything.  They pop out weird.  This is when...  No, this is when they...  Stop it.  This is when they made porkies and they showed tits.  Right.  They just showed tits.  This is when tits were a fuck.  No.  Meaning her tits are too low on her body.  Thank you.  They fucked it up.  No, those are her tits.  They fucked up the CGI.  No, they're just her tits. 
[03:09:00]  There's no CGI.  She had a low chest plate.  Whatever they called it back then.  It's 1982.  There was no CGI.  Whatever CGI was called back then.  They fucked that up.  It was called fucking just filming shit.  Yeah, take your tits out.  It's called tits.  You fucking b-whore.  Try to...  I think that she's wearing, like, a chest thing.  Now, what is she, con?  She's not wearing a chest plate.  Those are tits.  Freeze frame that shit.  Those are her tits.  Look at how low they are on her body.  So what?  She has a low titty.  She has low tits.  She got low tits.  No, she doesn't.  She got low tits.  They fucked it up. 
[03:09:30]  I'm telling you.  No, and it's weird because let me tell you something.  The way she's holding her jacket open, you're not seeing her collarbone and her arm.  You're seeing it from the neck down.  Believe me, her arms are coming.  Get her another picture.  It's an optical illusion of tit.  Yeah.  They're way too low.  They're not even set.  Oh, do your tits hang low?  Do they wobble to and fro?  Can you tie them in a knot?  Can you tie them in a bow?  Can you start in the grease?  She's hot. 
[03:10:00]  And those tits are real.  They're fucking real.  This is an ADD show of the worst variety.  Yeah, this show.  Can you throw them in a dumpster in the back of Sloan Kettering?  Do your tits hang low?  What?  I don't even know what's going on.  Enjoy dumpster tit jokes.  This will go on for at least a half hour.  No.  No, no.  I didn't have to mention the hospital. 
[03:10:30]  I love mentioning it.  It's horrible.  It's her.  It's her tits.  They're not.  Why do you think it's a special effect?  Because they're way too low on her body.  There she goes.  Look, look, look.  Look how pretty she is.  Look how pretty she is.  Look, look, look.  Those are fucking regular tits.  Oh, my God.  That's the same girl.  Fuck you.  Here we go.  She looks great in that.  Yeah, watch this.  Give me a fucking breather.  Fuck you.  Those are fake tits.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Look how much higher they are in this shot.  That's because she has the sports coat.  She's not wearing a tuxedo.  Hold on.  So as she turns around, pause it. 
[03:11:00]  She'll put it right there.  Oh.  Those are her tits.  Do your tits hang a lot.  Do they get caught on your toes?  Chip, that's a good one.  Look at those tits.  They're hers.  Come on.  Look at those hips.  Look at that cunt box.  A cunt box.  It's one or the other.  What the fuck, Bobby?  Oh, look at that.  Yeah, maybe that was just a bad angle the other one.  She looks great in that book.  She's smoking, and she's still hot now.  No, who is that?  Is she?  Oh, yeah. 
[03:11:30]  Check her out now.  Unlike Tony Montana's sister.  Joyce Heiser.  Looks like a fucking skeleton now.  Oh, my God.  She's so hot.  What happened to her?  You know she met some rich producer and just said, fuck the business.  Yeah.  I don't need to work.  I don't need to show my perfect tits in a movie.  What a great movie.  She showed him once and got the fuck in.  Joyce Heiser.  Hell out of there.  Nobody.  Yep.  Pizza dip?  What?  We're getting snacks together.  We're doing Eastbound and Down.  Pizza dip?  What is pizza dip?  You want pizza dip?  What is pizza dip?  It's pizza dip. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  You don't know what pizza dip is?  Pizza has been mushed up and you dip things in it.  That's silly.  It's all the goodness of pizza and then you fucking dip your chips in it.  Final interview with Joe.  Pizza dip?  You want pizza dip?  I can't do it.  I'm getting the snacks together.  I need hummus.  What do you want?  I'm interviewing the Grim Reaper.  And if you don't show tonight, I'm going to be sitting there by myself really sad.  I want wings.  All right.  We'll do wings.  What else?  And hummus.  Hummus?  Hummus.  You fucking savage.  Fucking terrorist.  Who the fuck's wrong with you?  Why am I a terrorist?  Because I like hummus. 
[03:12:30]  That's a Jewish dish.  I don't know.  Depends on what side of the fucking rock you're on.  Hey.  Larry King's final interview is with Jerry Seinfeld.  I hope he dies during the interview.  Oh, really?  Seinfeld's a nice guy.  What did he do to you?  Not Jerry.  Oh, Larry.  Not you.  Not you.  I saw Jerry the other night.  He gave me a handshake.  Hey, Norton.  You know I am.  No, he didn't.  Da-ha-da-ha-da-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  Very friendly guy. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  So it's on.  That's good for you.  He's just high.  Yeah.  He's always happy to see me.  I think on some level.  No, he doesn't love me, but he likes me.  What do you mean he's happy to see you?  He's nice to me.  He's not happy to see anyone.  We all know that by now.  He loves Tom Papa.  True.  Of course he does.  You're right.  But if I spoke, if I was talking to him, he would be pleasant and chat.  I love Tom Papa's three different personalities.  Oh, hi, Jimmy.  Oh.  No, it's not like that.  He's like, hey, Norton.  How are you?  Yeah, Jim Norton.  Yeah.  Oh. 
[03:13:30]  Listen, Tom.  Oh, Bobby.  What?  What's your name here?  He wouldn't even know your first name.  Did you say Bobby?  Yeah.  He wouldn't even.  Really?  He'd be like, get out of my way.  Help.  He wouldn't even help?  Help?  Nothing?  No.  Oh, Bob.  I would get ghosted.  I told you, I was on stage one night, they were like, get off.  And I was like, just leave the stage.  And I look, and I was like, oh, shit, he comes in.  So I did my shit.  I walk off, and he's looking, I thought at me, but he was looking at the stage or in 
[03:14:00]  his own head.  And I just waved because I was brought up correctly like a human being, just high, you know, be  polite.  I waved.  He looked right through me.  As I walked by, he kept just, he just kept his eyeline.  Does he have time for you?  I just wanted to bite my own hand off and fucking step on it.  You fucking faggot!  Why would you go up?  You fucking dumb hand!  You mad at your hand?  I was mad at my hand.  Bad.  Fucking insecure faggot hand.  Did you just feel like an ass? 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  Standing out there, he just left you hanging.  Oh, that's terrible.  Yeah, really?  I was four feet away from him, and I just walked off the stage as a fellow comedian.  You just wanted a nod from Jerry.  What do you think I was, I was just in the crowd going, you know, who's this guy?  Bob just wanted Jerry, he just wanted Jerry to go, good set.  Yeah, yeah.  Good job.  Good job.  Yeah, yeah.  No, not even that.  I don't want good job from him.  I know I'm not going to get good job from him.  Just a nod of acknowledgement that you are on earth. 
[03:15:00]  How about this right here?  That you just left the stage.  I just want his upper lip to go up and show his two big teeth.  That, ah.  Ah, ah, ah.  Ah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  And Tom Papa, hey, oh, Tom Papa with Jerry Seinfeld.  Yeah.  He's nervous.  Jesus.  I would be, too.  Yeah, he's one of those with the meal ticket to see him fucking talking to the likes of you.  Jerry is a little intimidating.  I'd stay away from both of us.  I get a polite nod from Tom when he's with Jerry. 
[03:15:30]  I don't blame him.  I understand.  Oh, really?  He doesn't need to fucking deal with you guys.  No.  Fuck that.  Oh, he's, Jerry's not around.  We're talking about Angry Birds, the iPad, blah, blah, blah.  Jerry's around.  It's like, who, who are you?  Yeah, exactly.  Marriage ref talk.  No, no time for you guys.  Yeah, yeah.  He actually, he was like, can you get me a napkin?  Can you please, and see when the, treats me like a waiter.  That would be the napkin part.  Right, the napkin part.  Ding, boom, bah, bah.  Scoop, ding, boom, ga, ga, ga.  Do your...  Da, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[03:16:00]  Da, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Love that.  Hummus and wings.  I mean, I hate it.  Why don't we get trout?  Why don't we eat trout chips?  Nah, we're going to go with trout.  We're going to go with bagel chips now.  Bagel chips.  Oh, yeah.  Dude, don't rub my fucking leg under the table.  Why?  I don't know.  Don't surprise me about it.  Just, you know, let me know what's going to happen.  Fucking cool.  Come on, dude.  It kind of feels good, and I don't like that.  Can we do the killer whale video?  What is it?  You fucking...  Oh! 
[03:16:30]  Here's Voss.  You in the tub.  That was you.  That's what Voss was saying.  No, but that was you.  Don't do a shitty joke and then blame it on Voss who isn't here.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Fucking...  That was Voss's sake.  Stop rubbing your leg, you fucking meaty calf on my knee.  I have a good calf.  You do have a calf.  A nice fucking meaty calf.  It's like a boiled piece of chicken.  My name in high school was Cavs McGillicuddy.  McGillicuddy?  What the fuck? 
[03:17:00]  That's when I get excited I do that.  Make that noise.  That's a good one.  Because I can't control it.  That's a good one.  Very excited.  If I was ever invited to one of your barbecues, invite me to one of your barbecues.  You're invited.  Oh, what time?  Let's see.  Saturday.  Be there at like 2. 
[03:17:30]  He's so excited.  I'll be gone though.  I'll be in Florida.  When are you coming back?  Sunday.  Cancel the barbecue.  I can't.  I have no barbecue plan, to tell you the truth.  But if someone comes over, I don't care.  Then you'd shoot me.  Just a friend trying to come over.  Shoot the hostage.  Not trying to steal anything.  Shoot the guest.  No, I don't fire blindly at people.  You have guns and alcohol and pocketbooks everywhere.  No, they're all locked up.  Putting a lock on my bedroom door now.  Really?  Now? 
[03:18:00]  I had to, yeah.  What did you have before?  Just a...  One of those push button locks?  I just shut the door.  Really?  I didn't think fucking guests in my home would go upstairs and fucking rip me off.  From what I hear, Danny, an arrest has been made.  Ooh.  Did you hear anything about that?  No, I haven't heard word one.  I heard from an inside source that may have been there that evening that he had spoken  to somebody and an arrest, a felony, larceny arrest has been made. 
[03:18:30]  Yesterday or?  Yesterday is when I got the text.  So I guess that's when it went down.  Are you going to press charges?  Of course.  Are you going to fag out?  You don't fucking rip my goddamn house off.  Don't get tough now.  And fuck...  Yeah, I know.  Don't get tough now.  That is true.  He was in your house and you had guns.  As a guest.  Yeah, but you knew he stole something and he was still there.  Anthony still got him a fucking...  Anthony still got him a beer.  Yeah.  Hey, dude, take a beer.  Just talk to me. 
[03:19:00]  Tell me the truth.  You can't use deadly physical force against somebody who's just taking something as a guest.  You can use fucking the butt of your gun and his eye socket.  There's a cop there that's going to back you up.  Faggot.  Throw down weapon.  Just take a throw down weapon and throw it next to him.  Yeah.  He pulled that on me.  Yeah.  That's all I saw.  Take out your anklet gun.  The anklet gun.  With your initials on it like a Yenta.  It says Anthony in diamonds.  My anklet gun.  It's a little 32. 
[03:19:30]  It's a two shooter.  Yeah, yeah.  A little fucking Derringer.  Take out the one you can get through the airport.  The one you made out of wood.  I don't have one like that.  That's from a movie.  I know it is.  With the rubber band and the wood.  That was from the Clint Eastwood movie.  Yes.  With John Malkovich.  Yes.  One of the best actors of all time.  Nobody brings him up when they talk about great actors.  I like John Malkovich.  Huh?  I like him.  No movie was fucking great.  What?  Con Air?  Not that great. 
[03:20:00]  The girl with the dragon tattoo.  The foreign one?  Oh my fucking God.  What?  What a fucking movie.  And there's subtitles?  I don't give a shit, dude.  There's a fucking rape scene in that movie that if you don't get hard in front of your  wife, I had to grab a pillow and put it on my lap.  What movie?  Because I'm just like, and I had to put that disgust.  Just like the rape scene.  I had to frown my eyebrows.  Like you were disgusted.  And my dick was, my eyebrows were saying one thing and my dick was saying another. 
[03:20:30]  What movie?  It's called The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  Ugh.  This, she has like a, ah.  What's a dragon on?  A note, yeah.  No, it's a dragon like a dragon from medieval times.  Her.  Oh.  I saw that on demand, but I had not rented it because I didn't like the idea that it's  a subtitle.  Doesn't matter.  I only watch Nazi subtitle movies.  Of course you do.  Downfall was great.  Original footage.  Das Boot.  Great. 
[03:21:00]  Is that good?  You watch it on a projector.  Like a fighter preparing for a fight.  Here we are.  Target Berlin.  See the way they hold their hands up?  Nice and sharp at the end.  Danny, get it right.  Jack Boots.  Listen to me.  The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  Oh my God.  She has a, she's in trouble.  So she has to, she's like a ward of a state.  She has to have a guardian.  This guy who was her guardian.  He raped her?  He fought.  Oh, the first, like the first things, her guardian died.  She goes to this new guy. 
[03:21:30]  She's a hot, like dykey chick looking, kind of smoking, foreign bitch European.  Got a dragon tattoo somewhere?  On her back.  Oh, okay.  And he goes, things are changing.  He takes her money.  If you want money, you gotta get it from me.  Like a pimp.  Oh, dude.  She has to get her new computer because she's a hacker.  Yeah.  She goes, I want my money.  He takes her in and just pushes her down.  Just takes it out and mushes her face into it.  Oh, I was like this.  Wow.  I was like, I wanted to hit rewind so bad with my wife. 
[03:22:00]  Because I'm sitting with my wife.  I would have said, how hot that was.  I wanted to, yeah, I'm going to take, I'm going to take my cock out and just keep rewinding  it.  Start smashing her face in there.  Yeah.  Can you cut your hair real quick, honey?  I want to, I want to get a Sharpie and draw a fucking dumb dragon on your back.  Would you have let that girl suck your penis like that?  What did you say?  Captain fucking what?  I like the fact that he almost said Captain Obvious.  But then he realized we're not on evening at the improv in 1988.  He said Captain. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, dude.  I would let her.  And then the second rape scene is a little, it's a little harsh.  Another rape.  Two rapes in one movie?  One.  Two.  Two.  I didn't see it.  Is that the first of the series with that girl?  First of the series with the girl.  The second one is actually at the Angelica.  I want to see that.  I heard it's good.  It's the girl who kicked a ball sack.  I don't know what it's called.  Is it a good though?  The girl who sucked the other woman's asshole out.  The girl with the dragon tattoo is actually a great movie.  Really good movie.  They're remaking it right now for American viewers. 
[03:23:00]  What country is it from?  It's from, I don't know, fucking Germany?  The American version will suck.  The American version will suck.  It'll stink on it.  Yeah, there's no way they can do this movie.  And the ending is fucking, it's fucking great.  Well, don't tell us.  Stop caressing.  I fucking stress his way to communicate with him.  Don't ruin it.  Look at her.  She's kind of hot.  Why do you sit so close to Jimmy then?  I have no choice.  There's a microphone.  You can move over a little.  I can't.  You're a little too close.  That's a microphone. 
[03:23:30]  It's his energy.  His energy.  Feeding off his energy.  His energy is, it's just fucking crazy energy.  Awful, awful fucking movie last night.  Hold on.  This guy wants to talk about it, though.  All right.  Carlton in the Bronx.  What up, fellas?  Hi, Carlton.  Talking about the girl with the dragon tattoo there.  And go.  The movie was a great movie, even though it's subtitled.  And the rape scene.  Fuck the reading part.  Oh, boy.  Did you want to spank up to that rape scene?  Wow.  You just said exactly what Bobby said. 
[03:24:00]  I'm saying it was just that good.  So you're reiterating what Robert Kelly said.  All right, but is it the best rape scene in movie history?  No, no.  I spit on your grave.  Had the best rape scene?  Which they're remaking, which is going to suck.  Because they'll be PC with the rape.  No, she's going to get raped, but they're not going to show it.  Not that I like rape.  Yeah, that's her.  That's kind of butchy looking.  Yeah, she's got a grape.  She's got a European body.  That's a good look.  What's a European body?  Skinny.  With a skinny fat.  With some fucking sandwich bag titties. 
[03:24:30]  Sandwich bag titties.  A little hairy under the armpits.  But you don't see that.  I kind of like it.  When we move you in, I'm sorry.  I bagged a couple chicks from Sweden.  Yeah, any good?  Yeah, they like to fuck.  European chicks like to get fucked.  And if you fuck them good, they'll fucking,  they're just yours.  They like it.  And they're fucking low-key.  They're very, they're not like, you know,  when are you going to call me?  They just go and do their shit.  I love fuck.  Yeah.  And I'm not good in Europe. 
[03:25:00]  Look at you, man about world.  Huh?  Look at you.  You're like the man about world.  Just going around.  I'm talking from, not from England.  I'm talking like Germany, France, those France.  That Europe.  French chicks love to fuck.  But they're fucking pussy smell.  All French chicks.  Holy shit!  98% of them.  Oh my God.  Hi, Colin.  Colin Quinn.  Colin Quinn.  Just saved the day.  What's up, Quinn?  Just stepped in.  I came here because these two phonies act like they have a radio show. 
[03:25:30]  Get a mic.  Go over there.  Go over there.  We want to hear all this goodness.  Colin Quinn has just walked into the studio.  There it is.  And Robert Kelly.  They're a legend of a radio show.  Who emails me the other day or texts me?  And he goes, hey, I know you got a new Broadway show.  Congrats.  Yes.  Congrats, he says.  Hey, well, maybe you'll come on my radio show.  You'll come on with me and Bobby and talk about it.  Like, anybody listens to that.  Like, it's your show.  They were acting like it was your show.  Oh.  No, but it was because we called it. 
[03:26:00]  It's nothing.  Well, that's what.  It's nothing.  Which explained why you were invited onto it.  It's nothing.  Because you can't hurt it any more than you hurt any other project you touched.  I mean, Bob, this morning I get an email text from Bob.  It's either or, asshole.  It's not an email text.  Exactly.  Fucking Travis Pickle Glasses.  He's Hollywood now, though.  He's not Hollywood.  But he's not Hollywood.  He's off-Broadway.  He's in fucking Camden.  No, he's at Broadway.  He just was. 
[03:26:30]  Ace Rothstein.  Welcome to Ace's High.  It's a show with Ace Rothstein.  The number one handicapper.  It's Ace's High.  Such is life.  Such is life.  Fucking God, it's all Hollywood.  It is true.  If you don't take those sunglasses off, I'm going to punch them off your face.  Just the fact that Bob, who, as you just heard from that statement, is the most, like,  you know, abrupt fucking guy, like, trying to, you know, bulletin' china shop. 
[03:27:00]  And he sends me a text this morning.  I'll read it right now.  Oh, okay.  It was an email text.  Yeah, a nice email text from Bob.  It was an email text phone call.  Hey, you up, Carl?  Like, he's gently shaking me.  Like, buddy.  Gently shaking me.  This fucking...  He's so...  Savage fucking mongrel.  I don't know how you can fucking be you.  You just notice everything. 
[03:27:30]  How do you not just blow your brains out, because you know we all just suck?  Gently shaking me.  You up, Carl?  You up?  You up?  Oh, is that great?  How do you read it?  That's exactly, first of all, going to be said, this is how fucking precise this fucking  idiot savant is.  That's exactly what I was fucking thinking when I wrote that.  But who notices that?  Who even picks up on that?  But here's why this Norton Bobby Debekel has bothered me for months. 
[03:28:00]  Debekel?  Debekel?  Fuck you.  Debekel?  Say Debekel again.  Yeah, why don't you...  Say it again.  Why don't you emphasize on the right syllable?  I'm going to bite your forearms.  Say Debekel.  It's wrong.  Don't...  Oh, my God.  Biting, biting.  Biting my forearms.  There's a whale eating a shit sandwich.  And a turtle was watching.  What's that?  Wow.  That was actually not bad. 
[03:28:30]  Did you really bite him?  What's wrong with you?  I was just laughing because of my fucking Jamie Hector response, how he was talking about  me.  I just didn't know.  Oh, my God.  What happened?  Nothing.  Just my new friend, Jamie Hector.  Look.  It's fucking tooth marks.  Wow.  I'm confused.  Wow.  He's bad at him.  What happened with Jamie Hector?  Oh, nothing.  He just...  Nothing.  He's going to get my teeth mixed.  We're just twittering.  That's all.  Just talking back and forth?  Yeah, you know how it is.  He's just like, you know, I was talking to Jonathan about you at the party.  Heard you had to go do radio.  It was a pleasure.  I didn't know you knew who I was.  Who's that?  Marlo from the Y.  Oh, I got to call. 
[03:29:00]  You know what?  I'm going to call Omar.  I got to text him.  You should.  Colin, you want to talk?  Well, just the fact that these sickening losers, you're older than those two nobodies  from the fucking wire.  You're just as big in your own way.  And you guys are sitting there like, I'm going to text him.  You know how many times he's had this conversation into the mirror by himself?  You're the star.  They're a nobody.  You were on remote control.  What were they doing?  They weren't even a thought in the daddy's underpants yet.  Take it and make it yours.  You judge.  He puts a scally cap on and heads out. 
[03:29:30]  I have to fucking punch those headphones into your ear.  Colin, I'm hearing all kinds of rumors about your show, which is very successful.  People loving it.  Thanks, Anthony.  I don't want to break it here.  I want to break it on their show.  I want to.  Oh, OK.  All right.  Big news about the show.  You have to announce in the New York Times.  Yes.  You can't announce in the local papers yet.  Yeah.  Fucking losers.  Hey, let me tell you something.  Here's what I want to attack their show.  Can I get to the attack on these two creeps, please?  Oh, of course. 
[03:30:00]  Please.  Please.  For months, I hear from different people.  Amy Schumer, all these people at the Comedy Cellar, Norton and them are having us on their  show.  And you can just see them sitting there.  Jim's sitting there going into serious guy mode.  We're doing a radio show.  We'd like you to have a guest.  To the young comics who are probably intimidated and think these two have power.  And they're like, oh, thanks.  I'm on Jim Norton's show.  She announced it to me like it was a big deal.  OK.  In retrospect, the story is not as great now.  No, I agree.  See, that's it?  No, but that's the story.  Damn it!  The radio show is usually, it's like, it's comics that you want to get. 
[03:30:30]  It's not supposed to be, quote unquote, more established guys.  It's why I've had guys who I want to see get more whatever.  You should have counted on them.  Get more what?  Well, that's why he's here.  Prestige by being on that shit hour?  No, to get more exposure.  Wait, how's exposure to all you and him?  Do you know that my...  And Mark, the producer.  I have, I think it's the fourth highest listened to show on the entire platform.  The highest what?  Fourth highest listened to show because it's on Sirius and XM.  It's Thursday afternoon at fucking four to five in drive time.  It's the fucking third, fourth highest listened to show on the entire platform. 
[03:31:00]  Why do you scumbags have me here at ten in the morning?  Give me part of that banana.  Because we're pre-taping today because I'm in Florida.  Give me part of that banana!  And I just lied, by the way.  I don't know how many people listen, but I'm glad to fucking shave you into silence.  Because he didn't shut his dumb mouth, didn't he?  He was going for that banana.  Oh, my God.  Put it in your zipper.  Make it mean that you zip like this.  You want me to put a priest outfit on and you can eat?  What are you doing?  Put it in your zipper.  Here's what you do.  Take a bite.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, God.  Oh, somebody take a bite.  Hey, Jimmy, why don't you offer to share it with them, you fruit, like you did with Gene Simmons? 
[03:31:30]  Wait.  I got it.  You want to share it?  I know you got it.  I'm just reiterating to the listeners that didn't know what a faggot you were.  I got it, Ralph.  Jim, you want another bite of the banana?  Look at Collins looking at these.  Give me a bite of the fucking banana!  Take a bite like I did.  That a boy.  Grab what's yours.  Collins just...  You fit it like a man.  Take what's yours from the brass ring.  Norton's a fucking...  Norton's going down on Bobby.  Bobby's holding it right by his dick and Norton's actually going down on the banana.  Did you get a good shot? 
[03:32:00]  Oh, that was a great shot.  Yeah, good one.  That was almost uncomfortable because he actually put his hands on me the way he would a tranny,  really soft and gentle.  Yes.  And then slowly pushed down and then closed his...  Like he would a tranny?  Sorry.  So what, Colin?  What am I hearing?  I'm going to Broadway.  That's so awesome.  Really?  Yeah.  Broadway.  Have you been to the show?  The Great White Way, as they call it.  I've been.  The Great White Way, which is also my street.  His neighborhood. 
[03:32:30]  Yes.  Did you go to the show?  I have not been to the show yet because I do not reside in the city and I leave this  place like I'm fleeing a fucking...  You don't live in fucking Pittsburgh.  I know, but I exactly.  You live 20 minutes out.  Let me tell you something.  You've got to support Kyle.  My friend.  He flees the city.  Yeah.  Is it still...  Are you still doing this?  Is it Thursday?  What about Thursday?  No, no.  It's not on...  It's not on till...  Wait a second.  It opens in...  I don't know.  What do I...  He tried to make his show.  Your Broadway show convenient for him.  You're going to have it on Thursday? 
[03:33:00]  If not, try to get it on Thursday.  If you guys do one man show, you can just do it at my house.  Do it at the karaoke bar.  Do it at my house.  In front of Danny and three fucking half-good-looking chicks.  That was the funniest fucking thing.  When you went off about the half-good-looking girls.  A chick with a fang tooth.  I thought it was good.  Do you have any root beer candy, Anthony?  Root beer candy.  Talking about how girls have one good attribute. 
[03:33:30]  Like good tits or an ass.  And then just trash.  Just a fucking...  It's Long Island.  What do you want?  I was going to say, as opposed to us.  I know.  Come on.  We have more than one good attribute as a crew.  What are you fucking reeling in there, Bobby?  I'm not saying that.  I'm not saying that.  I'm saying we're all fucked up.  I can't even get defensive on that one.  We all are ugly.  None of us are fucking great-looking.  No, it's true.  What are you going to do?  But I told you, this creep, Norton...  One night I was calling him ugly when he was growing up.  I said, at least I was good-looking growing up. 
[03:34:00]  He goes, you aren't that good-looking.  You act like you were as good-looking as Nick DiPaolo.  I go, I wasn't even a Bob Kelly.  Never mind Nick DiPaolo.  Oh.  He thinks...  I think we already discussed this.  You know what?  Everything's been destroyed.  Let me tell you a second.  It's like to see a doddering old man going over the same...  Did I ever tell you about the time that I dropped my Sunday...  Yes, you did.  But we'll listen anyway.  Gramps.  Look at that.  Look at that cutie patootie.  Oh, God.  What a big head you had.  That's what your forehead...  Jesus.  It's called your forehead, dude.  That's like Tyra Banks. 
[03:34:30]  Tyra Banks.  What is that?  I'm a cutie patootie.  That's what I am.  Your head's too big.  Your forehead's too big.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry I wasn't fuckable enough for you at the age of four.  I didn't even say that.  Your head's too big.  I wouldn't have fucked you.  That's a great target for cum, you fucking forehead.  Wasn't that thing on the fucking wall in the Omen 2, you fucking Damien-looking zilch?  What's that?  What, your exit fucking sounds? 
[03:35:00]  I'm going to get going.  What was that, Bob?  That was cheers.  For what?  That was...  I don't know what that was.  When's your show start on Broadway?  Come on.  Help me out.  Thursday.  It's Thursday.  Help me there.  It starts in November.  November.  I thought it was October.  November 9th.  October is the previews.  Okay.  Oh, what do you...  October 21st is previews.  What's the theater?  November 9th is opening.  Can you announce the theater?  I already know it.  What theater?  The Helen Hayes Theater.  The Helen Hayes Theater.  Where is that?  Couldn't get a better fucking name? 
[03:35:30]  44th Street.  It's right across the street from Pacino and Merchants of Venice.  How'd you like to be Al Pacino?  You spend your whole life as a great actor, and he has to look at my name and my crummy attitude  every day.  How long is he doing Merchants of Venice?  As long as...  My show will probably outlast his.  Good.  Really?  I hope so, too.  Is he getting good reviews?  I wrote it myself.  I'm like, Al.  He didn't write that.  Of course he didn't.  Merchants sold lifts.  He's called a great actor.  Merchants of Venice.  I'll take a wig.  I'll take some lifts.  How much?  Pack of cigarettes. 
[03:36:00]  Is this what it's come to with trashing Pacino?  Michael Corleone?  Michael Corleone.  Is this what we're left with?  At the end of the show, this is what we're left with.  He has trashed himself over the years.  He's great in those movies.  I disagree.  Oh, stop.  You know, the stage is a funny...  Why do you talk like this?  The stage is a funny animal.  Look, but don't touch.  Touch, but don't taste.  But if he didn't do that in that role, that movie would have been even more boring than it was.  Yeah, but it could have gotten somebody else to actually talk like that.  I loved him in that.  No, I thought he was great in Devil's Advocate. 
[03:36:30]  Yeah.  He was very good.  Yeah, I thought that was a good movie.  And Keanu Reeves was very good.  Come on.  When his wife killed herself, she was great in that scene.  Yeah, it was pretty good.  So what, I could have been great in that.  Oh my God, honey, what are you doing?  Wow.  Oh my God.  Beans.  Beans.  Louie beans.  Louie beans.  Call an ambulance.  Cut.  You're in the hospital, you dumb Jew.  That might have been one of the greatest moments in O&A history. 
[03:37:00]  It was fantastic.  Him getting a shame spiral when fucking Chaz arrived.  I was there.  I was there.  I created it.  I saved when Chaz was coming in.  Maybe we get Chaz in.  Let's go over how I did it.  Yeah, you get Chaz.  And I said we could have Vos do a scene with him.  It was perfect.  Will you stop holding me?  Will you stop touching me in a soft way?  You read, John?  John?  You read, John?  Does he moisturize or just has soft skin?  He doesn't have to.  He just has fucking like brand new baby turtle skin.  Baby turtle. 
[03:37:30]  It's like hard and mushy.  Because it's protected by the shell.  Nice soft skin, right?  Yeah, you do.  You fucking hate to do it.  Stop caressing.  City hands from counting money all the life.  Yeah, Mr. Hooper.  Are you going to have a bigger set this time?  Because the last one was just coarse.  Oh, Bob, get into the interview already.  It was a chair, right?  Bob, thank you.  That's a good question.  You know, when I go to the show, Broadway, and I pay a lot of money for a ticket, I want  to see the set even before the show starts.  You want to see what's out there. 
[03:38:00]  Right.  So yeah, of course it will be.  Yeah.  An elaborate set.  Is it going to be really an elaborate set?  Yeah.  With more stuff?  Yeah, I'm sure they're jacking up now.  Yeah, more stuff for Broadway.  It's just you, though, right?  It's Broadway.  It's just me.  You're not going to have like a hot chick.  You should have the Colin Quinn dancers.  You should have a midget.  They all come out and they sing, he's old, he's old.  I was laughing long with you.  He fakes a heart attack, they pick him up and throw him back up and do a dance number?  I thought you were doing the Ace Rothstein dance.  I kind of was, but then I just took it into my own thing.  Yeah, your own thing of attacking me and calling me old.  Sorry.  I don't think you're old. 
[03:38:30]  I think you're perfect.  You're the perfect age to make it.  You know what?  Hopefully.  He's not old.  He's a young corpse.  Young corpse.  You know what, guys?  I'm right where I'm supposed to be.  You fucking ass.  The power of now, right?  Yeah, right.  You probably say that no matter where you are.  Chip!  I hate Chip.  I fucking hate Chip.  Fucking Chip.  I fucking hate him.  Oh, he was at the cellar last night?  I'll say one thing about Chip.  No matter whether you love him or hate him, he is a fucking national sensation. 
[03:39:00]  I don't go anywhere where people don't bring up Chip to me.  Everywhere I go, they're like, what about Chip?  I'm like, yeah, that piece of shit.  Yeah, sure you do.  You tell him what happens, right, Bob?  I fucking hate him.  I can't see him.  He's just a word.  Because he's everything about life that's depressing.  There's so many people that are Chip-like, and it's a little bit of all of us, I guess,  but it's really just how many times you run into a chip in your life and you're like,  oh, fuck this prick.  Why am I still a mob with asses?  Just walk away from him.  How many times has Bob run into a chip? 
[03:39:30]  A lot.  A lot.  A lot of times a bag of them.  I'm sorry, Bob.  That's all right.  First of all, that only would have been funny if you said it in Chip's voice because it snunk.  But Anthony left.  He went up.  He was using the time.  I don't like that he had to go with a bag of them at the end.  We got the chip.  A bag of them.  We got it.  We got it.  We got it.  We got it.  We got it.  We got it.  But there's only one me, though.  There'll be like a whole bag of knees, you know?  Right, Chip.  I fucking hate Chip.  I like Lumpy.  Lumpy's my favorite. 
[03:40:00]  Who's that?  The uncle?  He doesn't come out there.  Paul's the uncle.  No, Paul.  I don't like Paul.  I like a pervert.  Of course he does.  There's a park at the end of my street that only kids can go to.  It's like a kid's park.  Walking with Norm.  Oh, God.  Just fucking.  He names the little kids.  I don't like it.  I don't like it.  Be careful.  I could be going up the slide.  Careful, Daphne.  Careful.  Careful, Daphne.  All right, Scotty.  You be careful now.  Come on, T.J., don't fall again.  I hate it.  He's fucking watching them.  He calls them Tattletales. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah, rotten little Tattletales.  That kid's kind of telling lies.  Telling her parents a bunch of made-up things.  Those lies cost him fucking six months in fucking County Jail, too, right?  Yes, they did.  He's blind in one eye.  They punched the shit out of him.  He's got a fucking broomstick and stuck it in his fucking pedophilia eye.  Yeah, I'm going to fuck the socket, faggot.  I had to tell everybody I was there for taxes. 
[03:41:00]  They knew, though.  Uncle Paul.  I like Lumpy.  Lumpy's a good one, though.  What's Lumpy's backstory?  I don't know.  As we say in the theater.  As we say on Broadway.  I think he was abused.  I think Lumpy was abused.  Yeah, though, they're all interchanged somehow.  Paul has molested all of them.  Paul molested Lumpy?  Oh, Jesus.  Lumpy's scared.  I don't think he molested Chip.  I think Chip is so unattractive and unappealing, even if he didn't get molested.  Chip hates him.  Chip hates Uncle Paul.  He does, yeah.  Yeah, Uncle Paul used to molest him.  Really? 
[03:41:30]  Oh, yeah.  And Lumpy really got the worst of it, though.  Yeah.  No, there's other ones that you haven't met.  Really?  Yeah.  And they all have relationships.  Yes, they do.  And they're terrible at it.  They're horrible at it.  Look, there's Uncle Paul.  They're bringing him in.  Uncle Paul.  Payback time.  Did you see that guy?  Yeah.  I saw that.  Wow.  That was a nice mood swing in this fucking show.  Anyway. 
[03:42:00]  All right, guys.  See you tomorrow.  Carl, how many seats in that theater, by the way?  You know, that's a good question.  It's kind of irrelevant, but it's a good question because there's 600 fantastic seats.  Wow.  And you know what?  Anthony, one's more comfortable than the next.  I actually sat.  600 seats?  It's a 600 seats.  You can't even sell fucking 40 seats in Kansas City.  Oh, shit.  Thanks, Bob.  No, is that necessary?  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  It was a joke.  A comic joke.  Not between you. 
[03:42:30]  Broadway.  He's a fucking star.  He goes, I'm kidding.  He's like, I'm kidding.  It's like fucking Jake LaMotta.  And then he got mad at me.  Yeah, fuck your wife.  I'm kidding.  Thanks for coming.  You're on it.  He's going to spill the drink on me.  Let me get that for you.  Let me get that for you.  How uncomfortable is the end of that movie?  It's the greatest.  I have just the end of the movie on TiVo.  I just like watching the end.  Just the end.  Just the end.  When he's doing his little stand-up and just yelling at the crowd.  Just fuck your mother.  That is fantastic.  Oh, it's great.  Then he goes up with the microphone to the girl and he fucking scans her. 
[03:43:00]  There's not even a funny joke.  The payoff's not until next week.  He didn't.  And they laugh and he does it again.  Fantastic.  Did you watch that Boardwalk Empire thing with Buscemi?  Yeah.  It was okay.  What did you think of that?  It was okay.  Yeah, that's what I thought.  I'm thinking.  Hawaii Five-0.  Fucking amazing.  Come on.  Stop it.  I'm not kidding you, dude.  Stop it.  I was watching.  Look, I love shit TV.  I watch USA Network all the fucking time.  But Hawaii Five-0 was fucking great. 
[03:43:30]  Why?  It just.  You just liked hearing the music.  No, no, no, no, no.  They played it the whole time.  There was no dialogue.  Really?  It was like an Asian movie.  Bob doesn't get to see many films shot in his home state.  That's why.  You fucking Samoan.  What was the thing you smashed me with one fucking Halloween?  You said I look like something a tourist would get.  At a souvenir shop in Japan.  In the Beijing airport. 
[03:44:00]  That's ruthless.  It's fucking brilliant.  That is ruthless.  Stands the test of time.  I enjoyed the corpse, the woman's corpse, and her big hairy pussy.  I like that, too.  That was a 20s muff.  Yeah.  My God.  I like that.  I'm back into that.  Yeah, they showed her tits, right?  And then they panned down.  They showed her tits.  They showed her tits.  And I'm like, she's a filthy fucking animal.  And she had a big fucking bush on a fucking cunt. 
[03:44:30]  Really?  Nice and subtle, Dice.  Very subtle.  I like how he just edges that in there.  We have a really double entendre, we call that, in the business, Dice.  A cunt.  Breaking barriers.  Oh, he certainly is.  Now, Bobby, the bush, right?  I love it.  You like it coming back?  I don't know why.  I'm getting into it where I like it.  I fucking like the hairy bush.  Because every girl shaved everything off, and then it became a novelty to see some hair. 
[03:45:00]  You get desensitized, and you get the pimples, the little, you know they have fucking, what  are they called?  Brazilian facials.  Yeah?  And was that a facial on your pussy?  You get a face, women get Brazilian facials on their pussies now, because they get, they  shave, and they do all that shit all the time, that they get zits on their pussies.  Razor bumps and shit.  Yeah, and they get a fucking, get a facial on your pussy.  Jesus Christ.  I, I'm telling you.  Looks like black girl's cheeks after he shaves.  I was going to say, it looks like Danny Glover.  Danny Glover, right? 
[03:45:30]  Danny Glover, pussy.  He's got those razors.  You got those razor bumps.  There's a word for those.  Ding, ding, ding, ding.  Of course.  Yeah, so I'm kind of digging, seeing a little bit of that come back.  Well, some girls have light hair down their pussy, like really soft light hair, so when  they shave, it's not that bad.  But some girls have that fucking cowboy five o'clock shadow.  Oh, by fucking, by like two hours after they shave, they got Fred Flintstone face. 
[03:46:00]  Yeah, you can see the root growing as they cut it.  The roots.  Ugh.  You could sand down a plank of wood.  Yeah.  That fucking thing.  Fucking awful.  It is really nasty.  It's fucking awful.  Yeah, it's usually Italian girls or, you know, those Mediterranean girls.  Got the thick hair down there.  Yeah, thick, thick, looks at the star from Entourage, his face.  Just in every scene, he can't just shave ever.  I tell you, though, that it's coming back because every girl shaved everything, and now 
[03:46:30]  a little bit is a little novelty.  The only thing that happens, though, is that this is what happens with those old pussies.  Yeah.  Bringing the old pussy back like they're bringing back the fucking charger.  Yeah.  Is the juice gets in the pussy hair.  The hair.  Yeah.  And then you really got to like the taste of that pussy.  Because I had a chick one time, art student, NYU, when I first moved to New York years  and years ago.  Yeah.  And she had that.  She wouldn't shave.  She had a hairy box. 
[03:47:00]  And I liked it, but it went down there.  And it was, I remember I was like, ugh, you should probably trim this.  And she was like, if you don't like to taste the pussy, then fucking leave.  And go fuck yourself.  Yeah, exactly.  And that's how I feel.  And I think the shaved pussy, it makes guys not know how to fucking go down on box.  Because all they got to do is fucking jump down there.  There used to be a whole thing where you used to have to take your fingers and make sure  the hair was parted like Moe Howard.  You had to have a Moe Howard part down the middle of the head and just get in there and  got to know where everything was by fucking touch and feel. 
[03:47:30]  You couldn't just look and go, oh, there's a clit.  The clit was buried somewhere in the Amazon fucking rainforest down there.  You're going to hire a guide?  Yeah, I have a Sherpa finding the clit for you.  You're going to wipe a spider off your shoulder?  You have to part the hair.  Say, what's the matter with you?  Hey, why I ought to...  Hey, Moe, look, a clitoris.  He does Larry.  Nobody can do Larry.  All I do is Billy West version of Larry.  Nobody can do Larry.  Billy West does it, and I just imitate him. 
[03:48:00]  Fuck it.  Yeah.  Oh, look at that.  Any plugs?  Where's everybody going to be?  We're pre-taping for tomorrow because I'm in Florida.  We don't have the studio.  Yes.  We have to start in two minutes.  You've got to start immediately.  I'm going to be in Marco Island, Florida tomorrow, Friday, Saturday.  Marco Island.  Off the Hook Comedy Club for tickets.  Marco Island.  Where is it?  Marco Island.  What time?  In Florida.  What time?  I don't know.  And what day?  Tomorrow through Saturday.  I'm going to be at the Stress Factory. 
[03:48:30]  Tickets are available now.  It's September 30th, I believe.  Yes, yes.  And then October 1st and 2nd.  Oh, cool.  It's a Friday and Saturday.  I'll be at the Helen Hayes on Broadway starting October 21st, previews, November 9th opening.  Yes.  Not Thursday?  And Thursday.  And tomorrow.  At my house.  At Anthony's house.  An hour of Colin with Bobby and myself on Raw Dog at 4 o'clock.  Yes.  Oh.  See?  You smashed the show, but then you're on the motherfucker, aren't you? 
[03:49:00]  Of course he is.  At Robert Kelly on Twitter.  Uh-huh.  Or RobertKellyLive.com.  On the interweb.  I see your tweets all the time.  Although it's a lot of business.  Well, you know what it is?  I want some fun fucking tweets from Bobby.  I just tweeted Jimmy eating.  It's a fine line between tweeting.  See, you don't need, you know, you have a gig.  I need to make sure people know about my stuff.  For another fucking few days, I guess.  Another few hours.  I'd love to see your fucking tweets turn business.  Listen, I'm...  Yeah, I need some fucking...  A guy looking for voiceover work. 
[03:49:30]  He won't even be doing stand-up.  He'll do, like, appearances.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey.  Just, hey, how you doing?  I'm here.  I'm here at Sayville.  And he's not making, like, an even number.  It's like 30...  Sayville.  It's $3,600 and, like, $20.  Well, he'll just come out there, but he won't even know how to, like, do the...  Like, Anthony will just kind of come out and just don't...  Someone will yell dice.  They'll go, hey!  Hey!  And the guy pays him in front of the audience.  How are we doing?  How are we doing, Levittown?  Hey, governors!  Hey, Mariches!  People can say whatever they want. 
[03:50:00]  Backstage, just a folding chair.  Let me tell you something.  People say, but they went, fuck Centerport.  I like Mariches.  Oh, God.  A case of old Milwaukee is in his rider.  Fuck that.  Oh, God damn.  What a nightmare that would be.  Yeah.  See how witty your tweets are then.  I'll be in Lovettstown.  All right.  You make a good point.  Making an appearance.  Yeah, fuck.  You make a great point.  See you tomorrow, buddy.  Take it easy, guys.  Have fun.  Have fun on Raw Dog, is it?  Have fun on the rest of the show.  Yes.  Have fun.  Colin Quinn.  Always a pleasure, as they say. 
[03:50:30]  And best of luck with the show.  I gotta see it.  I heard nothing but good things about it.  But I live on Long Island.  You know what a pain in the ass it is.  Give me your thing here.  I'll give you my thing?  Give me my number on the air.  Oh, yeah.  I'll do that on the air.  Actually, Jimmy's got it.  Because I gotta close this out.  I know.  I can't do this on the air.  I gotta sign off.  He acts like he did me a favor.  Yeah, I know.  That's the problem. 
[03:51:00]  He's like, oh, I'll get it for you.  And it's like, that's not a favor.  Me and Anthony agree.  Just give me a number, Jim.  Oh, oh, oh.  I got you.  I got you.  How about we do this?  I go to keypad.  And then you put in yours.  And then I'll just call it.  All right.  All right.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  I have to have your number now.  That's how.  That's the way of the future these days.  This is the future.  People just.  You don't have to write it down anymore.  Now you're calling yourself.  I can't talk to you.  Someone's calling.  You have a phone call.  I get it. 
[03:51:30]  Wow, I have Colin Quinn's number now.  Hey, it's not coming out.  It better.  What does it say?  Oh, there it is.  Got it.  All right.  Got it.  That's it.  Look at that.  Thank you, Colin.  I look forward to seeing you in the show.  I'm going to end the call.  Yeah, go on the fake show that nobody is really listening to.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, that was fun.  Wasn't it, Mars?  Everyone jumped.  Everyone actually came in.  We were having fun.  And then one at a time, everyone just left the fucking show and left me sitting here like a dolt. 
[03:52:00]  But, yeah, Travis is in there all ready to go, all ready to push a button and end today's programming.  Stick around for the lovely and talented Ron Bennington and Fez Watley coming up at 11 o'clock on these stations on 202.  And I believe, what is it, 190, what?  197? 
[03:52:30]  I don't even know what it is.  At 11 o'clock, is that Eastern?  What would that be Central?  Is that 10 Central?  What is it, Pacific?  It's very early Pacific, isn't it?  I don't give a shit.  I'm babbling.  I'm just waiting until the clock ticks down so I don't get in trouble time.  You know, I'm covering for everybody.  This is like the guy at work that has to stand around and punch everyone's card when the time hits, like, the right time. 
[03:53:00]  Everyone left, and you're looking out the door, making sure that Boston come in.  You got a handful of time cards waiting to just go ka-chunk, ka-chunk.  All right, fuck that.  I'm out of here.  Everyone have fun.  Bye. </pre>
