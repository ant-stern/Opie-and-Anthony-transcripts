<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of Jimmy's oddly-smelling oatmeal and high cholesterol, segueing into a humorous critique of poorly-executed NYC public art projects, particularly problematic waterfall installations and the resultant damage to a restaurant owner's trees.  Jimmy then recounted his experience at the Bob Saget roast, describing his medication-induced disorientation, a purported "dirty interlude" with Cloris Leachman, and observations of Norm Macdonald's performance. He also mistakenly identified someone in a photo as Alan Thicke, prompting the hosts to recall a previous incident where Jimmy was tricked into taking photos with strangers.

The show then addressed a conflict with Bubba the Love Sponge, who declared Opie and Anthony's new satellite radio deal a deal-breaker.  They lamented their replacement in some markets by inferior programming and played a bleeped Norm Macdonald stand-up bit about having a gay son.  The "Batman curse" was debated, alongside a discussion of Marissa Tomei's Oscar win and the continued popularity of *The Dark Knight*, confirmed by a caller who worked as an IMAX projectionist.  They attempted to reach a listener with cataplexy but were unsuccessful. The show concluded this segment with more discussion of their replacement and Citadel's business decisions.

The next segment started with a caller, Ed, describing his cataplexy and its humorous side effects.  This led to a discussion of fainting goats, followed by a darkly humorous account of severed feet and sneakers washing ashore in the Pacific Northwest and Canada. This morphed into a graphic description of a Greek man beheading his girlfriend, displaying her head in the village before escaping in a police car.  The hosts punctuated this with morbid jokes and transitioned to Craigslist ads for Greek lessons.  A "FU Line" segment featured angry listener voicemails.  News items sparked further debate: a Tyson Foods plant changing its Labor Day holiday to accommodate Muslim workers, an Ohio inmate claiming to be too fat for lethal injection, and other perceived examples of political correctness run amok.  Listener calls, often featuring offensive language, fueled a discussion about the decline of American values and overreach of political correctness in various aspects of life, such as renaming "Tug of War" and mandatory Valentine's Day cards in schools.  The hosts used crude humor throughout this segment and mentioned Cheech and Chong as upcoming guests.

The following segment focused on the perceived feminization of youth sports and the hosts’ upcoming contract negotiations.  Callers discussed the "everyone's a winner" mentality in youth sports and varying parenting styles, including corporal punishment. One caller recounted a story involving their grandmother using outdated racial slurs.  A phone call with their agent, Bob, ensued, marked by frustration and anger over their removal from various stations, accusations of poor management and questionable decisions by Citadel, and offensive jokes about Bob's sexuality.  They discussed a potential exclusive deal with SiriusXM and speculated on cost-cutting measures behind their removal.  The segment concluded with a reading from Charles J. Sykes’ *Dumbing Down Our Kids* and an interview with Cheech and Chong, discussing their reunion tour and past conflicts.  The interview was punctuated with the hosts' humor and frequent interruptions.

The show continued with Opie suffering from severe sinus congestion,  speculation about their agent, Bob, multitasking on a conference call, and a call from "Harry in Ohio."  Mel Karmazin's stock market success contrasted with the hosts' own less fortunate investments.  A caller, Harry, described a violent altercation with intruders, resulting in his arrest.  Opie graphically described his sinus congestion using crude analogies, and the hosts discussed a pastor stealing sex toys and numerous 911 calls about fast-food order problems, including one featuring a caller requesting a white police officer.  The discovery of a grand piano in the studio prompted jokes and a discussion about using it as a prop, including a joke about placing a booger on the keys. The segment concluded with further discussion of the 911 calls, a "Bombs and Flubs" segment featuring on-air mistakes, and additional jokes involving the piano.

The final excerpt opened with crude jokes about celebrities, transitioning into a lengthy improv segment featuring E-Rock’s high school fantasy persona, “Tankankerous” (frequently misspelled). This segment was marked by improv failures, misspellings, sexually suggestive and offensive jokes, and E-Rock's participation.  A WWE SummerSlam contest promotion followed, punctuated by interruptions, profanity, and off-color remarks. Steve, a production crew member, was briefly involved in a discussion about a sound clip and an accidental, potentially incriminating, statement.  A discussion about a Paul McCartney song and its rumored crude title, along with commentary on McCartney's personal life, preceded the playing of a song about Marsha Brady, accompanied by more off-color jokes and continued, unsuccessful, attempts to fully realize the "Tankankerous" persona.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I hate you, Jimmy.  You want the smell?  Jimmy's new food is this maple syrup oatmeal.  Yeah.  And I usually like a little maple syrup, but that smells awful.  And I'm an oatmeal guy, but what are you eating?  The weight control oatmeal or something?  Yes, it's trimmed down.  Wow. 
[00:00:30]  They just, I don't know what they did, but it just makes oatmeal just horrible.  But I'll tell you something.  It smells great.  It fills the room with a great maple-y fragrance.  It's wasps.  Yes.  I feel like we're in Vermont.  Bleeding the trees.  I have high cholesterol.  Oh.  Jimmy's got high cholesterol.  What's that about, Jimmy?  I don't know.  Maybe it's my genetics or something?  Yeah, it could be.  How do you help it?  I love that we bleed the trees for their goodness. 
[00:01:00]  Bleed tree.  That's what humans do.  Yes.  We find goodness wherever we go.  We make trees cry so we can put a little maple syrup on stuff.  Yeah.  On our flapjacks.  Yeah.  What about, I know we're just warming up here, but we got this dumb art project.  Every year or every two years, they do a dumb art project in New York City.  Yeah.  If you want to look up the Orange Gates of Central Park, that was the biggest one ever. 
[00:01:30]  It was so stupid.  That was a biggie.  And I like art.  I do.  I can appreciate some good art.  So do I.  Those dogs playing poker?  Yeah.  To me?  Yeah.  That's classic.  And I try not to be the guy like, that's not art.  Because you're not supposed to really say that.  Right.  But the Orange Gates of Central Park, that's not art.  It's not art.  So the latest one, they decided to make waterfalls under some of the bridges. 
[00:02:00]  Or one bridge, the Brooklyn Bridge.  And then they made a waterfall in the middle of, what is it over there?  The East River kind of?  And it looks like a sewage treatment plant.  The water just kind of, I'm serious, they have these pipes set up.  And it just looks like they're just pouring sewage into the East River.  And that's supposed to be a waterfall that's supposed to look beautiful and artistic.  And you're supposed to take little boat rides and take pictures next to this.  And it's just, it looks awful. 
[00:02:30]  You know why?  If it looked a little more natural, what the water was coming out of, some kind of stone  thing or just anything, but it's scaffolding.  It's steel scaffolding.  You've seen it too?  Yeah.  With like sprinklers on top that just pour water over the top of this scaffolding.  Right.  It looks very industrial.  Like you said, like a sewage treatment plant looks the same way.  But there's a story about the waterfalls today.  We go back to the one under the Brooklyn Bridge, which is kind of cool. 
[00:03:00]  I rode my bike through that area, I think last weekend or whatever.  And I checked it out.  It's kind of cool.  Did I ever send you those pics?  No.  Oh, I got pics of that for Opie's Eye.  I'll send them in.  I think that's one of those, you know, whatever they call them, the stanchions or something  for the bridge kind of hides the framework of the steel a little better than the one  just sitting out in the middle of the river.  You know, when I rode by it, I didn't see that scaffolding.  It really looked like the waterfall was coming out of the actual Brooklyn Bridge.  But that's not the point of why we're bringing this up today. 
[00:03:30]  What is it called?  Riverside Cafe or something like that?  This dude is losing his trees because of the waterfall.  Yeah.  And man, does that make me laugh.  That makes me laugh.  The River Cafe.  The River Cafe.  I guess it's a big deal on the waterfront of Brooklyn.  Yeah.  It's right next to the Brooklyn Bridge.  So you got this waterfall.  My voice is still shot from the effing comedy show.  And the wind is blowing the salt water on this guy's trees. 
[00:04:00]  And he's losing his mind.  The guy is losing his mind because they're turning brown like it's already September or October.  Like it's fall.  Your trees, they're dying.  Now this guy is saying he doesn't know if his trees will ever recover.  So I'm sure he's looking for a fine payday.  Yeah, they're all brown now.  They're killing the trees with this waterfall.  And they're claiming it's the salt water.  I think it's more the pollution because the East River isn't the cleanest river in the country. 
[00:04:30]  His friends are teasing him saying, hey, dookie trees.  Yeah.  Him and his brown trees.  This is one of those romantic spots where people go to have the engagement dinner.  Yeah.  And it's right there on the river.  So all those trees surround this beautiful scenic restaurant.  Oh, yeah.  And now they're dying.  Yeah, there's a nice picture of the trees going brown.  So I thought that was very, very funny.  Yeah.  Very funny.  Nice.  Yeah, man. 
[00:05:00]  It'll look cool.  It'll look like nature.  Meanwhile, they're just killing nature with their stupid waterfall.  And then I see like they have special boat trips you could go next to the falls.  Ooh.  Take a picture.  Yeah, it's just like Maid of the Mist up there.  Oh, for sure.  In Buffalo.  Oh, we don't have to talk about Buffalo anymore.  F Buffalo.  Oh, that's right.  But it's not.  It sucks.  And you see the disappointment on the faces of the people on these boats thinking they're  going to see something great.  It's like, wow, that really, really sucks. 
[00:05:30]  Let's say hi to John in New York.  John, what's going on?  Hey.  I work in Liberty Park and we look over at the waterfall that's on City Island or Governor  Island, one of them little islands that's out there.  But when the wind blows right, all the water doesn't go in the ocean or river.  It lands back on shore.  It just creates a big sea water cloud.  It covers all the buildings over there, which they may think is kind of funny now.  So salt water is the most corrosive thing on the planet. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  And for the next two years, stuff is just going to be falling off of these buildings.  They don't realize this yet.  We'll want to take longer than that, though.  We'll want to take a little longer than that.  Salt water rots.  Salt water will rot stuff in a matter of weeks.  You're like rotting things.  Well, the Aloha Airlines, that flight, that famous plane that was going and the roof ripped  off.  Oh, yeah.  That flight thing got sucked out.  They said that the corrosive, because it's 30,000 feet, but the little bit of corrosive  material that we could always fly over the ocean got to it. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  And eventually ripped the roof off.  Ripped the frigging roof off the plane.  Wow.  Yeah.  There's the, we'll put these pictures up on onaradio.com, but there's a picture of the  one that looks like a sewage treatment plant, basically.  Yeah.  It's just scaffolding in the middle of nothing.  Yeah.  So it's like a, it's like a floating waterfall.  What's the point?  And here I am.  It's supposed to be artistic.  So, all right.  There you go.  There's some, there's somebody's interpretation of art.  It looks cool at night, but only at night when it's lit up and you can't see anything  else.  The rest of it, like you said, it just looks like crap. 
[00:07:00]  Booyah to you, Steve.  Booyah.  Booyah to you, Jimmy.  Booyah, Iraq.  What is that?  Exactly.  A lot of people out there are saying, what is it?  Booyah.  Booyah.  You got to get like a, first, you got to get like a, first, you got to get  this.  Booyah.  That's a video.  It's fantastic.  Hey, we didn't get a booyah out of you.  I don't know how to do it.  All right.  Do it again, Anthony.  Don't.  Booyah.  It is a great video.  Here comes Jimmy. 
[00:07:30]  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Yah.  Yah.  Boo.  Yah.  Ah.  877-212-018.  Jimmy was out there in L.A. for the Bob Saget roast, and you missed a lot yesterday, Jimmy.  How was your quick trip to L.A.?  Which seems insane to me, because the last time I saw you, you were killing at the comedy  show at the PNC Bank Art Center.  And a few hours later, you were on a plane to La La Land. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  I call it the left coast.  No, you don't.  I do.  I judge.  Some people call it L.A.  Because, you know, language is a little salty there.  Yeah.  And then you did the Bob Saget roast.  How was that?  It was, I can't travel on day of show.  I can't do it.  I mean, I get so tired, and the pill I take, I mean, I really know what it's like to perform  high now.  Really?  All right.  It was awful.  The show was good.  But I was sitting there, and I literally could not connect thoughts.  I pulled out a good set. 
[00:08:30]  I was surprised I did as well as I did.  Oh, wow.  I could not collect thoughts.  I now know what it's like to not have your faculties.  I felt stoned.  It was terrible.  I want to see this now.  I don't even know if you'll notice.  I'm sure you're fine, but I just want to see your face.  I noticed little things.  I couldn't get my head where I needed to be.  It was so frustrating, because I felt high.  A bit foggy, right?  When is that going to be on TV?  August 17th.  Are you kidding?  They're turning it around that fast?  They are turning it around very quickly.  You guys should go to one.  I mean, it was...  Well, how about we get invited to one?  Well, that's what I'm saying. 
[00:09:00]  That'd be nice.  We absolutely should do that.  Cloris Leachman from Mary Tala Moore was on, and I don't know why they got her on.  She's 82.  She was in some of those Mel Brooks movies, too, right?  She was on High Anxiety?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Young Frankenstein was huge.  Nine Emmys.  She's won an Oscar.  I mean, she's a legend.  And she murdered.  She was definitely the funniest one of the night.  And it wasn't polite laughs, either.  She was great.  And I had, like, a very dirty interlude with her from the stage. 
[00:09:30]  Ooh.  Yeah.  I got some filthy ones on her.  Norm MacDonald.  Norm MacDonald's a weird dude.  No kidding.  Yeah.  He really is.  He was hilarious.  Like, he did this, like, weird thing where he went up, and he was just being, like, he  wouldn't curse.  He said it was the same, like, oh, what the age?  And he was being, like, these innocent, sweet jokes, like, you know, Bob, if you walk  up to a bathroom and the door says, gentlemen, you should ignore that and proceed in anyway.  Like, that type of stuff. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  And he really made me laugh.  And there was one lie where he made me laugh.  He goes, ah, Bob, he's the same stinker he's always been.  A stinker.  He called Bob Sackett a stinker.  But he said, ah, yeah.  Oh, dude, he was just.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Can we play our famous Norm MacDonald clip anymore?  We used to play it on regular radio.  That's another one they took away from us?  Probably not.  It would upset.  What happened?  Is it this one?  I know which one.  Not that one.  No, no, the one with my gay son. 
[00:10:30]  I'm very proud of Johnny.  He's articling over the.  Find out if we can play that.  Yeah, that was a big hit back in the day.  Well, after the show.  After the show, it was tremendous.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We were all talking at the after party.  And Alan Thicke was there.  And there was a few celebrities.  Nobody, you know.  And Cloris Leachman was sitting there with Alan Thicke.  So I walk over.  And I had already gotten my photo with her.  So I wanted to get a picture with Alan Thicke.  I'm like, why not?  So I'm like, do you want to get a shot with you?  And he starts talking about what a good job I did at the roast and how much he had a good time. 
[00:11:00]  So he was cool.  He stood up to take a picture.  And then I'm like, finally, I'm like, well, can I take a picture with you?  And so he grabs Cloris and he makes her stand on the outside.  And that's a cool picture with Alan Thicke, right?  It's a good picture.  I know it's right now.  But I got a cool picture with Alan Thicke.  Oh.  What is he showing you, Ant?  Who is that?  I don't know.  It looks like it's Cloris' manager.  I thought it was Alan Thicke.  No, you didn't.  I did. 
[00:11:30]  You really are the worst.  You actually thought this was Alan Thicke?  Yeah, I did.  Let me see.  Can we get this up on ONAradio.com?  I'll have it up by tomorrow.  Jimmy, for someone that loves celebrity pictures, he can't recognize celebrities.  You thought that was Alan Thicke.  You really are bad at recognizing celebrities.  Doesn't that look like him a little?  No, not even a little.  No.  I didn't know.  And she's just in the middle of eating food.  Yeah, I think the guy knew I thought he was somebody else.  Oh, that's funny. 
[00:12:00]  One of my favorite things.  Oh, my God, you dolt.  I forgot where we all were, but it was me, Florentine, and Norton, and me and Florentine  just, we had Jimmy so bad.  We had him like tapping shoulders of just complete strangers telling him, no, that guy's, what  did we say?  That guy was on, what show was popular back then?  It was a black dude.  This was the Dennis Leary roast.  Right, right, right.  Wearing some, it almost looked like a corset.  He was wearing this weird outfit, and he looked familiar.  I'm like, who is that guy?  And Florentine's like, I don't remember his name.  He was, he's like that new action star, and he's in a lot of these, he's in that new 
[00:12:30]  movie, like I forget he named the movie.  I'm like, really?  He goes, yeah.  He's like, get a picture with him.  So I'm like, I don't know.  He was talking to two chicks.  And then Jimmy looks at me, I'm like, no, really, Jimmy, because he knows Florentine  would probably give him, you know, wrong info.  And I'm like, no, Jimmy, seriously, Florentine's right.  I just don't know his name, but he's blowing up.  You're egging me on.  You're like, yeah, that's the guy.  He's in a lot of stuff.  Go ahead.  He's right there.  Take the picture.  And I walked up to him, I'm like, can I have a picture with you?  And he's like, all right. 
[00:13:00]  And I got a picture with him, and then I looked, and I saw him and Florentine rolling.  We got to like, we got to at least twice, though, man.  That was the bad one.  And I interrupted him.  He was talking to two white chicks.  And I just come over and ask for a picture, like I'm going to accuse him of shorting with  white women.  And this guy was a nobody like us, man.  He was a nobody.  He was a nobody.  He was a nobody.  I still have that photo, too.  It's just so uncomfortable.  So I'd love to see that photo again.  I'll make sure I get that to you, because I do have it. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  But yesterday, you missed a lot of fun on the radio, my friend.  A lot of fun.  Well, we dissected the comedy show.  We got kicked off of Grand Rapids, Michigan.  And there's a new show that claims to be the edgiest show on radio.  So of course, you've got to take a listen to the edgiest show on radio.  Turns out they replaced us with the program director and some dude that failed locally in Grand  Rapids, Michigan on the radio.  And the name is Gray and Cluck.  Gray and Cluck. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  And then we got Gray and Cluck on the show and had a little fun with them yesterday.  Beat them up pretty good.  And then we went after Bubba the Love Sponge, because he's still yapping, yapping, yapping,  yapping about nothing.  No one cares about him.  Exactly.  I tell you, it's me or them.  Goodbye.  Well, no, that's the beauty.  Just to bring everyone on board, Bubba the Love Sponge said that Anthony and I, being part  of the new satellite radio company, is a deal breaker for him. 
[00:14:30]  That if we're part of the new company, then he's out.  He's done.  Deal breaker.  So we told Mel Carmisen, who came on our show, he only picked a couple shows to do, and one  of them was ours, and that was quite flattering to us, for sure.  Sure.  And Mel just took a couple nice shots out of basically saying, is he on the board?  Well, I don't think he's on the board, so I don't think anyone's got to worry.  So then, now, stupid Bubba is doing that backpedaling and backstroking, and... 
[00:15:00]  He's like, I'm not happy about it.  He goes, it's not like it's a deal breaker or anything, but I'm not happy with it.  Yeah, and the damage control.  But now, his latest thing is, but they better not make me go in the same room as them, because  there's going to be problems.  What, are we going to sit at her, buddy?  I said, you're a phony.  You'll go in the same room.  You'll smile.  You'll do all the things that stupid, phony radio people do, just are right enough.  And then, you know what's going to end up happening.  Then, he'll go, well, all right, I'll be in the same room as them, but they better not 
[00:15:30]  look at me.  Don't look at me.  And then, he's trying to say that the whole point that he was even talking about us was,  why do we have to constantly rip on him?  And we brought up the point that we never even talk about this idiot until he gets on  and starts saying something stupid and inaccurate about us.  Like, he said that we were completely against the merger.  It's like, what?  That on our website, we had a site, a thing that went to the FCC to try to block the merger? 
[00:16:00]  Well, that was one of the message boards.  No, one of the message boards.  What the hell does that have to do with us?  They're going to do what they're going to do, man.  What can I tell you?  We don't sanction all of the message boards that are about us like you do with your one  message board.  Oh, what a tool.  So, we just laid into that fat loser.  It was a good day.  We got to head toward our first break.  We're stalling.  Can we play the Norm Macdonald clip or what? 
[00:16:30]  What?  Now, we have to beep it?  We didn't have to beep it back in the day.  Well, you got to beep the good parts.  We're talking about what it is, you know, yay, son does.  Well, the only reason we're playing this as we go to break is because he performed with  Jimmy and the rest of the gang out there in L.A. for the Bob Saget Rose.  Yes.  So, this is our favorite Norm Macdonald clip ever.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You need to be in bad taste as you look back on it.  Maybe at the time, you thought it was a good play, but you look back on it and you think 
[00:17:00]  that was in bad taste.  Well, sometimes, like in stand-up, I'll do jokes that are, like one time I was doing this  thing in San Francisco and they were all gay people in the audience, they told me.  So, I figured I'll do it.  In San Francisco?  Yeah.  No.  So, I figured I'd do stuff about gay people so that they could relate to it.  Yeah, it's warm up.  They love that.  And so, I was talking about, because I went to this gay pride parade and I saw in it there  were these old men and old ladies, like, with these signs that said, we are proud of our  gay son, you know? 
[00:17:30]  And so, I was saying, that's an odd thing to be proud of, you know, because it's not  an achievement, you know?  It's not like something you work all your life to be gay or anything like that.  And I just wondered, I just, I had a hard time believing that these 50, 60-year-old men  are actually bragging, you know, at work, like, hey, Bill, you know, my kid, oh my God,  we're proud of him, Johnny.  He graduated from Harvard, you know, first in his class, you know what I mean?  And now he's articling over at a law firm and, oh yeah, he loves s**t, you know? 
[00:18:00]  This kid, he can't get enough s**t in his mouth, this kid's all his s**t.  I got a, I got a picture of the boy here sucking another man's s**t, I want to show it to him.  Gonna go till I drop, your eyes are in or in the way, don't make me, I don't want to stop. 
[00:18:30]  Hey, good morning to everybody.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Is that Ozzy?  Of course it is, man.  Of course.  That's a cool song, too.  Booyah.  Booyah.  Hold on, we got Reno checking in today.  Booyah, booyah.  Uh, Terry, Reno, what's up?  Hey, good morning, boys.  Good morning, Terry.  How are you today?  Hey, well, I just wanted to say a lovely booyah to you, boys. 
[00:19:00]  Thank you, sir.  And booyah to the terrestrial audience.  Yeah, they don't know what booyah means yet.  Should we try to explain booyah a little later on in the show?  Wow, yeah, I don't know how the hell we'd go about that, but it could be done.  All right, if you stick around today, we'll explain what booyah means to the best of our regular radio abilities.  Yeah.  Hey, it was a horrible day in history today.  Horrible day.  Let's think.  We usually don't do the old this day in history thing, but when some of these pop up, you just got to mention it. 
[00:19:30]  Let's see.  Well, Marilyn Monroe died 46 years ago today.  Whatever.  Oh!  Whatever, that's not the horrible thing.  Back in 1861, income tax is used for the first time.  Hey, great.  Good.  So I guess, like, wow, 1860 was a good year, huh? 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, no income tax.  And, of course, you know, it's also a pretty good year if you wanted free labor.  Whoa!  Well.  Yeah.  You know what's funny about that?  Can you imagine, like, we all hate paying taxes, but can you imagine the people that had to pay taxes for the first time?  Like, you're going to do what to my what?  Yeah, wait.  I get paid, and you're taking some of it?  Like, why wasn't there just an all-out?  Yeah, how'd they swing that?  The first circumcision probably got a better reception.  Yeah. 
[00:20:30]  But how did they get that done without all hell breaking loose in the streets?  What?  You mean without a civil war happening?  Oh, wait.  Wow.  Is that part of the civil war, the whole income tax thing?  No, I think they were trying to, like, pay for things, but, yeah.  I'm sure people were a little angry.  Yeah, especially the South.  They were always angry.  Yeah.  Oh, by the way, there's a real picture of Alan Thicke there.  Yeah, that looks just like the picture of how you took, Jimmy.  Wow, you really... 
[00:21:00]  Did anyone tell you it was Alan Thicke?  I just thought it was.  Did you confirm with anyone and say, hey, is that Alan Thicke?  There's the real Alan Thicke.  A bit older than the picture you took with that gentleman out there in L.A.  My dumb manager, Jonathan, was there, and I think I'm like, that's Alan Thicke, but he's  like, eh, he didn't think it was, but he didn't say anything.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You didn't want to let...  You had your hopes up.  I did.  I mean, he was there, but I just didn't see him.  You got a picture of Alan Thicke if he never aged. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, but he's looking a little younger, right?  Maybe a little.  But everyone knows that show was, like, 20 years ago or something.  Yep.  I don't remember.  So, hey, a lot of people wondering if there's a Batman curse.  Uh-oh, the curse of the Batman movie?  And they started saying that there might be some kind of curse after, of course, Heath  Ledger, and then you had Christian Bale beating up his mom and sister there.  And they started saying, is there a curse?  You know, last week or a week and a half ago when all that went down. 
[00:22:00]  Putting curses on things.  Now you got Morgan Freeman just flipping his car over and over and over and over again.  Where?  Tennessee or something?  Mississippi.  Okay.  He was driving an old piece of crap car.  Yeah.  About a Mississippi Delta.  Coming home a bit late, but they're saying drugs and alcohol were not involved.  No.  And he flipped his car a few times.  And he was in critical condition yesterday.  What's his condition now?  I heard he's upgraded to serious and he has a broken arm. 
[00:22:30]  Ah, he'll be all right.  Yeah, they say you should make a full recovery.  But now the whole thing is, is there a curse?  Yes, there's a curse of the Batman movie.  Is there a Dark Knight curse?  And the first curse was actually Maggie Gyllenhaal's face.  Yeah.  Two hineys were placed on it.  Stinks.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't see any curse.  The damn movie grossed how much?  It's 400 million now, I think.  It's going to hit 400 today, I believe. 
[00:23:00]  I don't think there's a curse on that movie.  Well, I'm cursing that movie because I want to go see it again on the big screen.  And I can't find a showing.  Still sold out on the IMAX.  Yeah, I want to go again.  Unbelievable.  I don't want to see it on the small screen.  I mean, after you see it on the IMAX, you can't go to the primitive movie theater.  Yeah.  It's a regular little screen.  I love the fact that they have Morgan's ordeal on the post.  And there's an exclusive photo of the car.  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  It's all wrecked.  Yeah.  And then they have to show a movie photo, but it's a Freeman in a helmet in a car.  Yeah.  Yeah, they had to get him in a car.  What's the tie-in?  Like, oh, there's a picture of him.  We couldn't quite get the mental picture of Morgan in a car.  Right.  Thank you for putting it there.  So stupid.  Yeah, that's from the bucket list.  They should have had him with Miss Daisy in the back.  Yeah.  There you go.  Why didn't they use that one?  They probably smacked him in the back of the head with her purse and he flipped the car.  Shut up, you. 
[00:24:00]  She forgot it wasn't 1920 anymore.  She addressed him in a way that is no longer appropriate.  And hit the back of his head and he drove into a ditch.  That's what happened.  Miss Daisy, now it's just a shame.  They got this fine Hudson automobile sitting out there in the garage.  They ain't moved an inch from when Mr. Worthen drove it over here from Central Motors.  Seems like that insurance company doesn't give you a brand new car for nothing.  That's your opinion.  Yeah.  And my other opinion is a fine, rich Jewish lady like yourself ain't got no business 
[00:24:30]  dragging herself up the steps of no trolley carrying no grocery store bags.  I might come along and carry them for you.  I don't need you.  It's kind of strange hearing him do an accent.  Doing something different than just...  Yeah.  We still got to play our Morgan Freeman game where we just get clips from all the Morgan  Freeman movies and attempt to guess which movie it's from because he plays the same role  in every single flick except for that one.  The first day I met Andy Dufresne... 
[00:25:00]  I must admit I didn't think much of Andy the first time I made eyes on him.  There he is.  Looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over.  That was my first impression of the man.  What do you say, Randy?  A tall drink of water with a silver spoon up his ass.  That guy never had...  10 cigarettes.  That's a legit bet.  All right.  Who's going to prove me wrong?  Haywood?  Digger?  Steve?  Oh, Floyd.  Oh, brave souls. 
[00:25:30]  Turn yourself lost.  Breathe in count.  All prisoners, turn yourself lost.  Maybe I'll get a gun and rob the food way.  I could shoot the manager, sort of like a bonus.  Stupid Brooks, go hang yourself, you dumb old bastard.  Brooks was here.  Someone ought to carry your groceries full, you missed days here.  That won Best Picture, I believe.  Did it?  I think it did.  It was so boring. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, it's just, you know, it's charming.  Was it charming?  You know what I believe the worst Academy Award given out was?  It had to be Best Supporting Actress for Marissa Tomei in My Cousin Vinny.  I mean, that movie was just one of those, eh, movies.  You kind of watch it on a weekend on TV.  It's on all the time.  That was not an Academy Award winning performance by Marissa Tomei. 
[00:26:30]  Nope.  Marissa Tomei.  She was lightly amusing in it.  Yeah, lightly amusing.  You know, nice to look at, I guess.  And just, eh, probably the worst Academy Award ever given out.  Not the worst decision, no.  No?  No.  What was?  Her performance was cartoony.  I'm with Anthony on that, man.  I think it was the worst one.  Yeah.  Name another one.  Like, you could think of other ones where someone else should have won, 
[00:27:00]  but at least the person that did win, like, put in the effort.  All right.  Fair enough.  I was going to say, in 1974, Art Carney won for Harry and Tonto over Al Pacino in Godfather 2.  All right.  No.  You know something?  Yeah, but you could almost see why they did that, because he's old.  Yeah.  And he was probably, you know, close to death.  Raging Bolden won Best Picture or Best Director.  Yeah.  What did?  Well, that was a crime.  Ordinary People in Redford.  Yeah, but you could see how that would happen to her. 
[00:27:30]  That is, like, one of those things the Academy would love.  You're saying someone that, like, you can't comprehend how anyone would say she deserves an award.  It's just a goofy movie.  It's like, you know, giving an Academy Award to Caddyshack or something.  You know?  It just, I don't know.  Is she a pause attraction?  Oh, I know.  And the tires are different than, all right, we get it.  You're from frigging Brooklyn or whatever.  She sounds like Lisa the Sales Girl here.  Yeah.  How tough is that to go? 
[00:28:00]  Man, do my reins.  You guys did such a good job.  I'm going to get some money from what you did for me.  Thank you.  She could have been in my cousin Vinny without even trying.  By the way, something dope on Instant Feedback.  Opie, you idiot.  If The Dark Knight was still sold out, it would have grossed another 100-plus million again, dumbass.  Oh, my God.  I'm from Highstown, New Jersey.  Go F yourself.  There's an IMAX theater pretty close to where I live. 
[00:28:30]  And, yes, The Dark Knight is sold out for another week.  In the IMAX.  Yeah.  Not all the theaters, dummy.  And if you listen, you dope, I said I don't want to see it on a regular screen.  Because after you see it on the IMAX and if you want to see it again, you can't go to the regular screen.  That's downgrading.  I want to see it on the IMAX again.  What an ass.  But I have to wait at least another week because they sold out that damn IMAX theater for the first three weeks of the showings.  Would have grossed another 100 million, Opie. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  Dope.  Jimmy, you were on to something.  Speaking of The Dark Knight, Bale's Batman voice too much.  Shunk.  Good.  But they're now all talking about it.  I do believe you might have started this.  You broke this story.  I had to.  I saw it before it was out.  Yes.  Though The Dark Knight has been a bonafide cultural event.  And boasting rave reviews and success at the box office, it hasn't been immune to criticism.  Some have quibbled with its political undercurrents and others have criticized a muddled theme. 
[00:29:30]  But here's the critique most widely held.  Why does Batman talk like the offspring of Clint Eastwood and a grizzly bear?  Wow.  Jimmy said it was a Clint Eastwood impression.  Particularly when his rage boils over, Bale's Batman growls in an almost beastly fashion, reflecting how close he teeters between Do-Gooder and Vengeance Crazed Crusader.  Though much of the voice effect is Bale's own doing, under the guidance of director Christopher Nolan, and blah, blah, blah, their frequency of his Batman voice was modulated to exaggerate the effect. 
[00:30:00]  I said that.  Wow, really?  I said that.  It's not in tune with everyone else talking.  I said, man, they're doing something with his voice in post.  Are they exaggerated?  Absolutely.  That's odd.  Critics and fans have noticed his Batman rasps his lines in a voice that's deeper and hammier than ever, said NPR's David Edelstein.  Why are they giving David Edelstein the credit? 
[00:30:30]  We started this.  NPR.  NPR.  Yeah, they're the ones who had their finger on the pulse, Batman.  You idiots.  The New Yorker's David Denby praised the urgency of Bale's Batman, but lamented that he delivers his lines in a hoarse voice with an unvarying inflection.  And reviewing the film for MSNBC, Alonzo Duller wrote that Bale's Batman in Batman Begins sounded absurdly deep, like a 10-year-old putting on an adult voice to make prank phone calls.  This time, Bale said the same thing.  Oh, they're ripping off all your lines. 
[00:31:00]  I don't know.  I said it sounded like a little kid disguising their voice.  Yeah.  Because I was thinking of Voss's dumb joke.  Hello, is daddy there?  You're getting no credit.  This article's all about you.  You said the Clint Eastwood.  You said all this stuff.  They probably just heard the show.  I mean, we all chimed in on it, but sure.  Yeah, so there you go.  But it's getting pressed.  NPR.  Yeah, exactly.  And then I'm looking at RottenTomatoes.com now.  The movie got a 94% positive review. 
[00:31:30]  And then you got to wonder.  I'm not sure if we read the reviews of the dummies, but there's like one or two reviewers in America that are saying, I don't know.  Could you go back there?  The Too Cool for the Room ones?  Oh, yeah, it's got to be a different guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Could you get one of the bad reviews?  There's literally only a couple.  Like Rolling Stone critics.  Oh, yeah.  They are the worst.  They are the worst.  No, they're just the worst with anything that they review.  All right, we got two.  Powerful acting, powerful action, huge IMAX sequences give the Batman, this Batman, a great big commanding feel. 
[00:32:00]  However, story is held hostage to action, especially in the second half of the film.  Blah, blah, blah.  And then you got another guy.  The plot is often impossible to follow.  And the film, though dark, isn't as deep as some have claimed.  Yeah, you got to be different.  It's about a guy with a cape who solves crimes in a state that doesn't exist. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  Right.  What death are you looking for, sir?  This is not the Manchurian Candidate.  It's about a man who has a yellow bat on his chest and flies.  You know, he drives a car that can jump buildings.  Yeah.  And, you know, everything he has, he's a bat-themed man.  Bat-themed.  Horses ass.  He had bats attack him when he was a boy.  And then Liam Neeson helped him somewhere in a cabin.  It's just what he wants.  The movie has grossed $600,000. 
[00:33:00]  $600,000.  Oh, $600,000.  $600,000 worldwide already.  Chuck, New York, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, Chuck.  I'm a projectionist at the IMAX theater up the street from you.  Oh, really?  Whatever we can say.  You're talking about, yeah.  Right on, man.  Yeah, I just got home, actually, from work because I live two hours north.  Yeah, we just came in.  Yeah, we might have passed each other on the highway.  Who knows?  Which is really sad.  Point.  I had a 12.30 show last night, sold out. 
[00:33:30]  They're going to have a 9.30 show this morning, sold out.  It's crazy.  Yeah, thank you for backing up what I was trying to say, because that dummy on instant feedback.  I'm telling you, you can't get into this IMAX here in New York City to see The Dark Knight.  You got any connections there, Mr. Projector?  Yeah, come on.  Take me off the air, take my cell phone, and we'll work something out.  I want to be front and center, my friend.  We want to show them with no one else.  I don't want one of those sides. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, I don't want one of those side seats in the IMAX theater.  Just a showing with no one else.  That would be all the way.  That's what we want.  They're sold out.  The IMAX theater is a fantastic seat.  Every seat in the house is great.  No, Chuck, we have our demands, and Jimmy will tell you.  Here's what we want.  Write it down.  We're fancy.  Saturday night at 8 o'clock, we want to see the movie, and we don't want anyone else there.  Three seats.  That's it.  Right.  I got a quick ad, though, if you guys want to know about Steven Spielberg. 
[00:34:30]  Opening weekend, he shows up with nine people, wants to come in and see the show.  He goes to the audience that's waiting in line, offers them ridiculous amounts of money to buy their tickets.  We have no available tickets.  No one would sell him a single ticket.  He has a folding chair in the back of the house for Spielberg to watch by himself.  You know what?  He obviously wasn't offering ridiculous money.  What is ridiculous money?  $100?  Well, I know it was in the three figures, but you figure it could cost $16 to get into the damn thing.  I understand, but if Steven Spielberg is one of the richest guys in America, I think if he started peeling off some thousands, 
[00:35:00]  those people would have gave up their freaking spot online.  $2.50 a ticket probably.  I think he can swing it.  Yeah, sure.  A grand a ticket.  Right.  That would be chump change for Mr. Spielberg.  Of course.  Thank you, Chuck.  Hold on the line, because I really want to go.  Or else just threaten to redo it.  If you're Spielberg, say, if you don't get this ticket, I'll do part three,  and I'll put a little creature with a big pointy finger who wants to go home to another planet in it, 
[00:35:30]  and Batman will be destroyed by the extraterrestrials' love.  Really fruit it up.  Let's say hi to Dave in Medford.  Dave?  Hey there, Dave.  Hey, what's going on, man?  Hey.  Going back to Marissa Tomei, you know, the rumor was she actually won that year because  she was nominated against four British actresses that weren't really that well known.  The favorite was Judy Davis, but no one, just 18 years ago, no one really knew her that well. 
[00:36:00]  Well, Anthony makes a really good point, but we need to look at who she was up against that year.  Who is she up against?  Stump Brand will be on it in two seconds.  That's right.  Watch them.  I know who's favorite was the favorite, and she was visibly pissed when she didn't win.  I think she was up for Husbands and Wives, the Woody Allen movie.  I don't remember anybody else.  Marissa Tomei shouldn't even have been nominated.  It was a rumor.  It wasn't Oscar worth.  By the way, if you want to see Marissa Tomei naked.  Wow.  And she's like 40-something now, right?  Yeah.  I think she's like 40, 41, somewhere around there. 
[00:36:30]  What are you going to do, Mr. Skinner or something?  No, hold on a minute.  It's a movie called Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, which was an amazing movie that no one saw.  It's one of those artsy flicks with Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Oh, yeah?  And what's his name?  The guy that has like a dog face.  Alan Thicke?  That used to be married to Uma Thurman there.  Oh, oh.  Yotha Koto?  No, no, no.  Pete Best?  Oh, it looks like Stunt Brain isn't doing too well today.  What's the matter?  Oh, Boog Powell? 
[00:37:00]  You know how you told us when our brains aren't working, you're ready to step in?  That's why you're Stunt Brain.  What happened?  I know who it is.  Yeah?  Carl Malden.  He does have a dog face.  Before the Devil Knows You're Dead was a terrific movie.  It really was.  Yeah, Ethan Hawke.  Thank you.  Oh.  Ethan Hawke.  Anyway, the opening scene is Marissa Tomei just naked and having sex.  Yeah?  It's pretty damn hot, man.  I don't see that.  I know, Anthony, she's way too old for you, but look at that.  Marissa Tomei is nice.  Look what's going on to Marissa Tomei. 
[00:37:30]  Jesus, Palomino.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is dogging her from behind.  And I mean dogging.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  And Philip has to look at himself in the mirror as he's having sex with Marissa Tomei.  Wow.  Go, Philip.  Jesus.  Her body is ridiculous.  That's nice.  Ridiculous.  It's so funny when they go, the sex scenes when we film them, it's really impersonal and  there's a crew there and it's very difficult to do.  Look at that.  He's having sex with her.  Yeah, basically. 
[00:38:00]  Pretty much.  Absolutely.  Where's the still?  These guys are all liars because they're like, oh, yeah, we're just acting and yeah,  exactly.  Yeah.  Well, they wear a sock.  Yeah.  They put like this sock thing.  Look at that.  Oh, okay.  That's a 40-something-year-old body.  Nothing wrong with Marissa Tomei.  She's aight.  Yes, they're a stunt.  She was up against Judy Davis in Husbands and Wives, Joan Plowright in Enchanted April.  Hold on.  Look at that picture. 
[00:38:30]  Okay.  Yeah?  That's pretty good.  All right.  What was the last one?  Joan Plowright in Enchanted April, Vanessa Redgrave in Howard's End, and Miranda Richardson  in Damage.  Damn.  Well, how did...  Those are pretty...  Yeah.  How did Howard's End, their...  What's-her-name not get that?  Well, Redgrave and Plowright probably canceled each other out because those were both those...  Those...  What?  Those two costume dramas.  Those really sound like horrid movies, like all the ones that were against... 
[00:39:00]  A little boring.  Marissa Tomei.  It just sounds like awful, forgettable movies.  All right, well, I guess that's how she went.  All those movies are Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.  Well, no.  We're going to do Brotherhood.  The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.  Right.  Wow.  Jimmy, we're doing a parody.  Not even a parody.  We want to do a movie.  We want to put it on YouTube.  It's going to be a YouTube sensation.  We want to do Brotherhood of the Smelly Sweat Pants.  Wear Opie's stinky sweatpants from gym, from the gym. 
[00:39:30]  You know, we all wear them and go on adventures and see what places we get kicked out of for stinking.  Well, I almost got kicked out of the old gym yesterday.  I was doing physical therapy, and I...  Just before I left, and I have to do a lot of, like, you know, a lot of stretching exercises.  Uh-huh.  And I had to take my sweatpants from the hamper.  From the hamper.  I didn't have any clean gym clothes.  Oh, no.  I went to the gym just... 
[00:40:00]  These things were just rank.  Why don't you do your laundry?  And then I had to do all these bends and stuff, so I know I was waffing some odors.  Oh, yeah.  No doubt in my mind.  It's with the Reverend Run.  Huh?  I'm trying to do that, but I'm distracted by the Reverend Run.  Dressed like an Amish gentleman.  What is he doing?  He's known for his hat.  What can I tell you?  But it's a different hat now.  He's, like, got some kind of a...  Like a Hasidim.  A Hasidim.  Yeah.  It's like a Hasidic hat, but it doesn't have the payus. 
[00:40:30]  It looks like a black version of that gentleman.  You're all gonna die!  It looks like Fred Berry now.  Yeah, he really does.  What happened to the Reverend Run?  The girl's interviewing him.  Yeah, Jill.  Yes.  Jill's interviewing Run.  I thought we were supposed to get Run on today.  Eh.  What happened?  Eh, screw him.  What happened?  Let's say hi to Joe in Philly.  Joe.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Love you guys.  Love the show.  Yeah, I know. 
[00:41:00]  Opie, you've been getting a lot of guff today, man, and I'd like to give you props.  Okay.  Peppers.  Yeah.  For correctly giving the theater the correct name this time around.  I've been practicing.  I'm calling it iMac.  I'm sure you have.  Practicing?  I've been practicing on two fronts, saying iMacs instead of iMac, and I'm also trying  to say interesting instead of interesting.  I never know.  It's a Long Island thing.  You say interesting.  That's very interesting.  You gotta get that T in there a little bit. 
[00:41:30]  Just a little bit.  Interesting.  So I've been practicing.  Some people say interesting.  That's interesting.  All right.  I usually say interesting.  Interesting.  And then interesting.  Which is, I think, a local thing, but, you know, the rest of the country, they think  it's weird.  Thanks, Joe.  I appreciate it.  Hey.  It's good to know my...  Booyah!  Booyah!  Booyah!  It's good to know my practicing is paying off.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show, 877-212-O&A.  When we get back, we got a girl, and, man, do we have to get her on the show. 
[00:42:00]  The girl who collapses every time she laughs.  Yes.  Insert bad comedian here.  Yeah, exactly.  Who she would never collapse in front of.  Right.  Hi.  How are you?  I hear you have this problem.  No, but see, that's not fair to him, because he's funny on a stage.  Yeah, but you just got a goof on him, though, because he's rich.  Yeah, Rich Voss.  All right.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  A big Booyah to everybody today. 
[00:42:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Anthony, people want to know if you brought in your Citadel stock certificate.  You said you were going to wipe your you-know-what with it.  Damn.  Yeah.  I have to go into my files and find it under junk, under trash, under scammed.  Dustin in Albuquerque, New Mexico. 
[00:43:00]  He writes on the instant feedback.  I just want to say thank you to the brilliant minds who swapped out O&A here in Albuquerque  and put in the station, ESPN Deportes.  And then he writes, I never liked English anyway.  Great, they put in some kind of a Mexican show.  We got replaced in Albuquerque, New Mexico, for Spanish sports. 
[00:43:30]  The Citadel, they know what they're doing, huh, Ant?  Yeah, they're great.  Oh, we get it.  You're taking us off all your stations.  All the stations.  We get it.  Isn't that great?  We must have just failed all at the same time everywhere.  Right, right.  It never happens, but nice money saver.  But they're replacing us with crap, and that's what is frustrating to us. 
[00:44:00]  If they were replacing us with, I don't know, the go-to shows like Sean Hannity or something.  Oh, we got replaced for 96.3 KBZU Casa de ESPN de Portes.  Telefono.  Telefono.  Telefono, what?  We're replaced by telephone?  Well, no, then the telefono or the phone number.  Oh, they give you the phone number.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:44:30]  That scared me.  I thought they were replacing us with a phone.  Unbelievable.  We get it.  You don't want to do business with us anymore.  Great.  And you're replacing us with crap all over the country.  Cheap crap, which is good.  Even though we weren't really setting the world on fire as far as income from that place.  Well, eventually they're going to run out of excuses, and then they're going to have to do the right thing and fire some executives and get some new blood in there that know what they're doing.  Yeah, how about you do that?  How about you look into some of the cubicles and offices around Citadel and see what the hell's going on in those places? 
[00:45:00]  They're running out of excuses, and this isn't going to do anything, and then they're going to finally have to fire some executives.  Yeah.  You should have done that a year ago.  Yeah.  Leave us in our spots.  Fire the executives.  Get some new blood in here that knows how to compete in this new world of radio.  It's getting tougher and tougher every day with the satellite radio, the iPhones, the HD radios, the 3G technology, the Wi-Fi. 
[00:45:30]  Pandora's box.  All right.  Pandora.  It's not that easy, so maybe you need some executives that understand what's going on in this new environment.  I was doing that, the Pandora's box there.  I had it on my iPhone, and I had the little Shelby out yesterday, and plugged it right in.  It's coming out of my nice sound system in my Mustang.  I just hit line in on my radio, and there you go. 
[00:46:00]  It's going right from my iPod out my car speakers, and the volume is all adjustable on the radio.  It's so convenient, and it's whatever you want to listen to.  So, like you said, these jukeboxes that they think they're putting on on the air, when it's Shut Up and Rock.  Yeah, you should be listening to Shut Up and Rock.  You shouldn't be, like, plugging in your iPod and listening to what you want to.  But I could listen to what I want.  You need to listen to Shut Up and Rock with commercials. 
[00:46:30]  Running out of excuses.  Running out of excuses, Citadel.  Girl, look within your walls, you dummies.  If you replaced us with, like, real, like, talent and real shows.  Yeah.  You know, Gray and Cluck, Shut Up and Rock, Spanish Sports.  You know, replace us with whatever, you know, that's whatever it is. 
[00:47:00]  But when they replace us, yeah, with a program director and some guy, like, program directors, we talked about it, they're not really on-air talent.  It doesn't work very well.  Well, the guy in Buffalo, you know, we had an email thing going back and forth, and he's like, they're going to make me do an air shift instead of continuing with you guys.  And he goes, I haven't done an air shift since college radio.  Yeah.  So you've got a guy that hasn't done radio since college, now doing mornings in Buffalo instead of having this show on the air. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  Look within your walls.  You have officially run out of excuses.  The girl who collapses every time she laughs, people.  And she is beautiful.  They prescribed this program for her.  I get it.  See, because she wouldn't laugh at this.  Yeah.  Because we're too dirty.  She's a beautiful girl with a weird disease.  Yes. 
[00:48:00]  We'll get her picture up on onaradio.com.  She looks like any other student with her life ahead of her.  Happy, relaxed, and without a care in the world, everyone.  But 20-year-old Kay Underwood could be paralyzed if she gets a bit of the giggles.  Come on.  She's smiling in the picture, and she's standing.  Yeah.  How far does it have to go?  You'll have to be holding on something.  Look at your hands.  Oh, yeah, she's holding.  She's probably holding a fence post or something.  Yeah.  She's laughing, cracks her head open.  I would imagine this girl is, well, I don't know.  I was going to say this girl is going to be all over TV in the next day or two, but maybe 
[00:48:30]  no one wants to take the chance.  Yeah.  Just lay her down somewhere so she can't fall.  Right.  The pretty architecture student from whatever, whatever, has, wow, cataplexy?  Or do we say cataplexy?  I think it's cataplexy.  Let's go with cataplexy, which is a sudden weakening of the muscles brought on by strong  emotions.  Strong emotions at all?  Like, you know, what if she's, you know. 
[00:49:00]  What if you're really good?  Gets her.  In bed?  Yeah.  In Ms. Underwood's case, laughter is the cause, but other known triggers are excitement,  anger, and in at least one bizarre case, smugness.  Oh.  Certain reporter.  Mwah.  Yeah.  Mwah.  Mwah.  It looks like there'll be traffic all day.  Mwah.  Thunk.  False.  Mwah.  On one day alone, the University of Lincoln student collapsed some 40 times before she lost 
[00:49:30]  count.  40.  Jesus.  She must just get tired getting up off the floor.  I don't think there's a single person who has not tried to make me laugh, she said.  Yeah, then you got the sickos that just need to see this happen.  There are times when it does get to me.  If something embarrassing happens, I'm only 20.  I hang around with a lot of people.  Sometimes there's not a way out of it.  We got to get her on the phone.  Can we talk to her?  We'll see if we can.  There was a show on this. 
[00:50:00]  The Learning Channel had a show on this called I Woke Up in the Morgue.  Apparently people do this and it happens and they think they've passed out.  The show is called I Woke Up in the Morgue.  Yeah, it's a special TLC show.  See, Morgan's okay.  They just showed him on the Today Show.  See, there he is.  There's Morgan Freeman.  He's fine.  He's fine.  Oh, they're re-promoting Batman.  See, he's fine.  Batman.  Oh, that was a taped piece.  But I haven't...  There are times when it does get to me. 
[00:50:30]  If something embarrassing happens...  I'm only 20.  I hang around with a lot of people.  Okay, sometimes there's no way out of it.  But I have learned a few tricks, like locking my knees together or grabbing onto something.  Sometimes my friends grab onto me.  But they're saying this is a real thing.  It certainly is.  Yeah?  Yes.  Hey, Ted.  What's up today?  I had your only navel.  Well...  A lucky guess?  Oh, good guess.  I tried a little stand-up comedy.  Yeah.  Yes.  It was spoiled by Miss Underwood falling to the floor. 
[00:51:00]  So that means you were a hit.  You had her laughing and she collapsed on you.  Yes.  I said two Jews walk into a bar.  Apparently one of them was the purchaser.  And she laughed and fell?  No.  No?  She fell asleep.  Boo.  They do say she has narcolepsy, too.  Yeah, same thing.  So it had...  Oh, are they...  Is it...  Yeah.  They said that 75% of people who have narcolepsy probably have cataplexy.  Okay.  And just don't know it.  Well, this guy on the phone has the disease. 
[00:51:30]  Ed in Philly.  Yeah.  How's it going?  Hey, Ed.  They're not doing a story on you because you're not a hot chick.  You know that, right?  I know.  I'm a big fat guy now.  You're a big fat guy.  So who cares about your story?  But if it's a hot chick, then we're all sad.  They probably think Ed falling asleep is because of his fatness.  Right, right.  Oh, poor fatness.  And his laziness.  Poor fat guy.  Ed, you really got this disease?  Yep, I have it.  I was diagnosed two years ago with it.  And what happens?  Well, it came out of the blue, really. 
[00:52:00]  It was just like one day, felt like I was dehydrated.  Next thing I know, they took me off.  I was drinking probably about eight liters of Mountain Dew a day.  And then I just, they told me to stop drinking so much Mountain Dew, and it was just lights  out from there.  You could walk up behind me, go boo, fall down.  Now they have me on all sorts of different drugs.  How many times do you fall down a day?  During the day?  Well, now since I'm on the medication, I fall down probably about two to three times a day. 
[00:52:30]  All of a sudden, you just fall.  What's that?  All of a sudden, you just fall down?  Yeah.  And what brings it on?  It doesn't have any rhyme or reason.  I mean, it could be, you know, walking to get the mail.  It's just a weird shift in, I guess, emotional change or something along those lines, it causes  it, but it really, it's sometimes fun, and other times it sucks.  When is it fun? 
[00:53:00]  It's fun, you know, you're out hanging out with your friends, and all of a sudden, you  know, you're at a party, you have a couple beers.  And then you fall down, and people are like, ooh, what's wrong with that?  And then you get a big crowd around you, and then all of a sudden, you come up out of  your little episode, and you walk away like nothing happened.  Everybody's, you know, it's more of a gag type of thing as far as the fun goes.  Yeah, you haven't really described fun yet.  We're still waiting for that description. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, that's not really the realm of fun.  Yeah.  Well, you ever see a big fat guy fall down for no reason?  It's fun for everyone else, sure.  Yeah, sometimes it's fun for me, too.  Why?  How do you see?  You're the big fat guy.  Well, you know, you can't laugh at yourself.  Do you like the attention?  Like, when you get up, they're like, are you okay?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Nah, not really.  That's not even fun.  All right, Ed.  I have cataplexy.  You're depressing the hell out of everyone.  You're not fun.  No, you're bataplexy.  All right, thanks, Ed.  Let's go to Jared in Boston, listening on BCN. 
[00:54:00]  Jared.  I don't talk, uh...  You're self-static.  I think he wants to say, is she related to those goats who get scared and fall over?  Remember that story?  Fainting goats.  The fainting goats story?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  It's apparently very similar.  It's a neurotransmitter that's messed up.  The cataplexic system.  So they just kind of freak out and keel over. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, same thing.  But this, on one of the reports on Scholarpedia, says that laughter or anger...  Scholarpedia?  Yeah, it's another...  Scholarpedia?  Scholarpedia.  Oh, scholar.  I think it says Scholarpedia.  No, sorry.  You read Scholarpedia?  Yeah, it's a little more credible than...  A little more scholarly.  That's too much knowledge, man.  Miss Underwood's condition has improved.  The hot chick that has this.  She now hopes to retrieve the driving license.  She was forced to surrender. 
[00:55:00]  Exactly.  Why would you ever want your driving license back?  Or driver's license back?  Never.  How did she get one?  I don't know.  Well, actually, nothing funny ever happens at motor vehicles, so there couldn't possibly  be a chance she would fall down there.  Talk to that ape behind the counter who's going to be rude to you.  And then she writes, people think narcolepsy is quite a funny thing, but it's like being  exhausted all the time.  These fainting ghosts are fantastic. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, you've never seen the fainting ghosts?  No, I just want to yell boo all the time at them.  They get scared and then they just kind of fall over and faint.  They get scared.  Faint and fall over.  I guess you faint first, then you fall over, right?  Yeah, that's usually the order.  You are.  If you fall over and then decide to faint, you're an ass.  But you're safe.  So there you go.  The girl who collapses every time, she laughs.  That's got to be hell on earth.  Look at these stupid coats.  And their little tails are all back and forth.  Coats are stupid. 
[00:56:00]  Look at them.  And then they can't get up like they're drunk.  The guy opens an umbrella?  Where's this video?  Can we link this to onaradio.com?  It's a whole...  Are they called a herd?  Yes.  All right.  A herd of goats.  And then a guy opened up an umbrella really fast.  And it scared the crap out of them.  And they all fell over at the same time.  What a cowards.  I hate to have them protecting my house.  That is really goofy.  They just...  That's large goats.  Their arms just go all stiff and they fall over. 
[00:56:30]  What useless animals.  Yeah.  Just for food and some clothing.  They have nice chops.  Slam chops.  We're going to move on.  Delicious.  But we're going to link that video to onaradio.com.  We got a serial killer, I believe.  We touched on this yesterday, but now we got the official news.  News story.  They're finding feet and sneakers.  That's where they belong. 
[00:57:00]  One foot, one sneaker.  Yeah, but no...  Washing up.  No rest of the body connected.  Just the feet and the sneakers.  Maybe the guy hates socks.  He's protesting socks.  Another shoe containing human remains has washed ashore in the Pacific Northwest.  A shoe with a sock in it and some bones and flesh and stuff in it.  Five other severed feet and sneakers have been found just north of here in Canada.  And this discovery is adding to the mystery.  Well, I thought we better be talking to the RCMP up in Canada because our initial blush was, of course, that this was related. 
[00:57:30]  Officials aren't releasing much details of the shoe, like the brand or the size, but do say that it was a right one, like most of the others that were discovered.  Crews are still on the scene with dogs searching for more remains.  The foot was found Friday, and authorities say they're not sure how long it had been there.  Since it wasn't actually floating in the water, it could have been there for some time before it was discovered.  Officials are running tests on the remains now and hope to have initial results by the end of the week. 
[00:58:00]  They're questioning Paul McCartney.  He's finally had it.  Paul McCartney is the latest serial killer.  But just leaves feet.  That's like an odd thing.  Yeah, Canada's bored, man.  You had that beheading on the Greyhound bus.  Fantastic story.  And now you've got the feet washing up in the sneakers.  Or one.  One foot in one sneaker.  They enjoy their dismembering up there, don't they? 
[00:58:30]  They sure do.  I'm not happy if they're not chopping somebody into 50 pieces.  Such a kooks.  You know, there was another beheading, too.  In Greece.  In Santorini, one of the most beautiful places on Earth, there was a beheading.  Some guy beheaded his girlfriend, was it?  Yeah.  Not just his girlfriend.  No?  Is there more to the story?  I only have the headline on this one.  A 31-year-old man killed his girlfriend on the Greek island of Santorini.  A Santorini. 
[00:59:00]  You're coming to Santorini.  Santorini, you're coming.  Very good.  Is that close to the island of Lesbos?  Lesbos.  A proud to be a lesbian.  Lesbos.  Can we get the lesbian clip, please?  The old guy that's proud to be a lesbian.  That's just amazing to me.  Yeah, he beheaded her, then fled in a patrol car.  What?  During the ensuing chase, the suspect was shot five times by police and ran over two women,  doctors, who were riding a motorcycle before he was caught.  The suspect, oh boy. 
[00:59:30]  And the Naciosa Arvantitis.  Wow.  I don't know.  A cook at a local restaurant is undergoing surgery at an island hospital.  Neighbors said that following a heated argument.  This must have been one hell of a heated argument.  Arvantitis, Arvantitis, beheaded his girlfriend's dog.  What?  He beheaded the dog first with a butcher knife?  All right.  Now he's really crazy.  Then killed and beheaded the woman.  I bet you more people are outraged that a dog got beheaded than a woman. 
[01:00:00]  Initially, this guy roamed the village of, wow, Vorvo.  In Greece, though, the women don't need the heads.  That's secondary.  You know what they like in Greece.  Now in France, they probably would have chopped off her butt.  Because you need the head.  Oh, yeah.  You speak French?  I love that. 
[01:00:30]  You speak French?  You speak Greek?  Yes.  Wah, wah, wah.  Or Greek lessons, they call it.  Greek lessons?  Yeah, Greek lessons.  Giving Greek lessons.  Really?  Yeah.  Craigslist, they give a lot of Greek lessons.  I didn't realize that so many people wanted to speak a foreign language for $150 for 30 minutes.  How much could you possibly learn in that short amount of time?  What do you learn?  Stavros?  Stavros?  You better learn soap and water. 
[01:01:00]  Get that off of you.  E-do.  That's what you say.  E-do.  Repeat after me.  E-do.  E-do.  E-do.  Greek lessons makes me so happy.  E-do.  What a weird way to...  I know.  And French.  Speaking French.  Speaking French, of course.  But that's even more...  Speaking French is something more common because they teach it in high school.  Nobody you know speaks Greek unless they're from Greece. 
[01:01:30]  No one takes Greek.  What are you doing?  I got a Greek class at 3 o'clock.  It doesn't happen.  Silly.  Silly.  Greek lessons.  Jimmy's right.  There's a lot more to this story.  So this guy, he chops off the head of his girlfriend.  Then he roamed the village exhibiting the woman's head to people.  And then neighbors...  Wait.  He roamed around with the head just going, hey, check this out.  Yeah.  And then, well, that got everyone scared. 
[01:02:00]  I could see that happening.  The townspeople, they locked themselves in their homes and called the police.  When a policeman tried to handcuff him, the suspect knifed the officer and flung the victim's  head into a patrol car.  This guy was hot under the collar.  Well, here's the evidence.  Here's everything you need.  And then he made off in a second patrol car.  So then...  He stole a cop car?  So he throws the head in one patrol car, jumps in another patrol car.  So you got to think the policeman didn't have time to remove the severed head.  So now he's chasing the guy with a severed head in his patrol car. 
[01:02:30]  He's just rolling on the seat back and forth.  Right.  Like a bottle gets wedged under the brake pedal like when you leave a bottle in there.  And it still starts yapping and backseat driving.  Shut up.  The mouth is moving and you can see it's going, make a left here, slow down.  He's looking at right.  Wow.  Put it on the big siren on top of the car so it looks like she's going...  That's all he ever heard when she talked anyway. 
[01:03:00]  Cue Benny Hill music, though.  What a mess.  He throws the head in one patrol car.  He takes off in another.  Yeah, in fast motion.  And then...  There you go.  And then you got...  So then he makes off in a second patrol car and ran over the motorcycle before he was caught.  One of the two doctors suffered multiple fractures.  The other was uninjured.  The police fired at this guy.  A straight bullet hit a woman bystander.  What a mess this was.  This is the dumbest story.  Do you know how much trouble this guy's in? 
[01:03:30]  He's in Dutch.  You think he's in a bit of trouble there, Jimmy?  He killed the dog, cut its head off.  Killed his chick, cut her head off.  He's going to be charged as being a public nuisance for waving the head.  He stabs a cop, steals a cop car, runs over a motorcycle and gets a lady shot.  Yeah, throws the severed head in one car.  So now that guy's not going to sleep at night anytime soon.  Oh, he had big trouble.  Oh, yeah.  I'd imagine he's going to get a couple of years for this.  A couple.  Just a couple. 
[01:04:00]  Slap on the wrist.  Unbelievable.  Cute story.  Very cute story.  We go to break with the FU line.  Stay there.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Here's the latest batch of FUs.  You have six new voice messages.  First voice message.  This is Casey from Erie, Pennsylvania.  I'd like to give a big f*** you to Carla, you ignorant little f***.  Leave me the f*** alone.  F*** off and die.  Next message. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, I just want to give a huge f*** you to my f***ing job.  I really can't stand waking up at 5 o'clock in the morning anymore.  I was about to go quit.  F*** you.  Next message.  Yeah, I just want to give a big f*** you to the New York State lottery.  I just bought $50 worth of f***ing tickets and I didn't win.  So much for my f***ing money going to support my kid's education.  F*** you, New York State lottery.  Next message.  I just want to give a big old f*** you to that f*** that gave me crap last week.  Those f***s are itchy as hell. 
[01:05:00]  I've never had them before.  I don't want them again.  F*** you.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to send a big f*** you out to Steve Guttenberg and his big stupid face.  F*** you, Steve Guttenberg.  Next message.  Hey guys, I want to give a big f*** you to my soon-to-be ex-girlfriend  who came home yesterday with a serious case of bleach breath.  Man, bitch, I am on to you.  End of new messages.  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1. 
[01:05:30]  Thank you and goodbye.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie is rushing back from the bathroom.  He just jumped on his chair.  Anthony is a peck, peck, pecking away.  And I'm Jim Norton.  Just kind of standing.  Kenny's seated.  Mike is standing.  And you're out seating. 
[01:06:00]  All right.  So all is as it should be.  A couple of stories really annoying me right now.  What is that?  That's techno music is annoying me.  What is that?  I want to do a popper.  Yeah.  Poke myself through a glory hole.  Some gaping.  Were you grabbed him with both hands and separated?  Yes.  He yawns.  Ted Kennedy got fatter since his tumor.  What happened to him?  Wow.  Is that old footage or new? 
[01:06:30]  Ah.  Maybe he lost weight since then.  That's old.  He got the tumor out of his head.  They squeezed his head and it popped into his body.  No.  No.  They did that medical procedure.  All right.  What do we got going on?  Jimmy is very irate.  Well, we all are, I think, a little annoyed.  Sure.  Which one should we do first?  I mean, whatever.  We got two that you want to get into, Jimmy.  You got the Tyson chicken thing and you got...  What's the other one?  The Ohio inmate says he's too fat. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's too fat to be executed or something.  How about this?  Plant drops Labor Day for Muslim holiday.  Uh, and this is in, uh, in Tyson chicken in, uh, in Tennessee.  Good thing it wasn't a...  Good thing they didn't make pork.  I guess they...  Ah, well, what would they do?  Uh, some workers at a local plant will no longer be able to take their Labor Day holiday  because of religious reasons.  Workers at Tyson Foods Poultry Processing Plant in Shelby, Shelbyville, will no longer have  a paid day off on Labor Day, but will instead be granted the Muslim holiday Eid Al-Fir, 
[01:07:30]  whatever, Al-Fatir, E-I-D-Al-F-I-T-R.  I don't know how to say it.  According to a news release from the retail, wholesale, and department store union, a new  five-year contract at the plant included the change to accommodate Muslim workers at  the plant.  It's October 1st, and, um, union leaders are saying that it was to accommodate the 700  Muslims that worked there out of 1,200 people.  1,200 people, 700 Muslims. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  So they take away a national holiday, which is really, it's celebrated all over the country  by everyone, and they replace it with, uh, a religious holiday, and of course Tyson  chicken also has a Muslim prayer room.  Um, but again, I guess it's a privately owned company, you can do that, but to take away  Labor Day, uh, a national holiday like that, and can you imagine, and Mike raised a great  point off the air, if a bunch of people, let's say a plant, a mostly white plant, or people 
[01:08:30]  who didn't like Martin Luther King voted, they didn't want to celebrate Martin Luther King  Jr. Day.  Yeah.  Uh, how fast would it be a big problem with that?  Yeah, they pick something else.  Yeah, but that's where racism ends.  When you know you're going to get a day off.  Oh, yeah, without a day off.  Yeah.  You know, I kind of like that.  Yeah, well.  I kind of like the, you know, the blacks.  Yeah, you know, no one argues when there's a day off.  Exactly.  Just replace Labor Day with, it's just so-  That's disgusting, Jimmy.  Aggravating.  Absolutely disgusting.  So you want to eat Tyson chicken? 
[01:09:00]  Feel free.  I wouldn't eat it.  Labor Day is part of Americana.  It really, you know, that's just-  It doesn't matter.  I like to have an apple and look at a Rockwell painting on Labor Day.  America had its day.  It's over.  It's over, Johnny.  The Chinese are coming.  Everyone else is coming.  Everyone else is doing quite well out there as we just continue to-  Just fall as an empire.  Because we just spend too much time arguing about stuff instead of getting things done.  I don't know what happened.  That is true.  There's just constant arguing and bickering going on over the most ridiculous things, and 
[01:09:30]  nothing gets done anymore.  We cave in to everything.  No one's got any balls anymore to stand up to anybody.  This country is really turning into a pile of mush with no real strong leadership.  People that are willing to take chances for the better of the country.  You know, it's just not happening anymore.  Well, there's a story today. 
[01:10:00]  Drill.  Should we drill?  Should we not drill?  Yeah.  But we'll argue that now.  Well, I don't care what side you're on, but we'll now argue that point for years.  I kind of like that they're arguing that point because, as they do, the price of oil just  keeps dropping.  Yeah.  It's down, what, 127 or something like that?  It dropped like $4 a barrel overnight.  $1.21?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's get it back down under $100.  We're getting gassed below $4 a gallon again, right?  Keep talking about drilling.  That's all they got to do.  National average is $3.88.  All right. 
[01:10:30]  It used to be over $4, remember?  Yeah, it was over $4, and now oil has dropped 18% since we talked about drilling.  See?  Who drops the oil price?  Drill.  The speculators.  There are guys who try and figure out what the amount of oil is going to be on the market  and what the use is going to be, and they try and put a value on it.  They should be shot.  Yeah, it's just that it's...  Yeah, they speculate if there's going to be enough, if there's...  But then it changes on a daily basis, so the speculation is crap anyway.  It's not based on anything.  It's based on a guy, whether or not he had sex the night before.  I'm angry. 
[01:11:00]  Raise prices.  This guy's mad.  I didn't get any last night.  You're paying more for gas because I'm unhappy with my situation.  That's right.  We said back in the day when Alan Greenspan was the man, we said,  just get him hookers every day.  Keep that guy happy.  Economies, great.  And we'll all be rolling in the money.  Depression, not me.  Right.  You get him, you know, talking Greek every night.  Get him somebody to teach him Greek.  We would be rolling in the money, my friend. 
[01:11:30]  Everyone likes Greek lessons.  Yes, of course.  That's going to make me laugh.  That's why we should give a holiday to the Greeks.  We can all learn Greek.  So we lose Labor Day.  Right in the old gyro.  So they lose Labor Day at that plant, and now it's a religious holiday.  Yeah.  You know.  It doesn't make any sense, though.  Labor Day was a union-built holiday, and the union negotiated this.  That's right.  A part of Americana.  I'll say it again.  And it was here.  It started right here in New York City.  The unions fought for us to have 40-hour work weeks and fought for us to have paid holidays, 
[01:12:00]  and to give up Labor Day.  This is insane.  I tell you, America, we have got to stand up or suddenly Sharia law is being imposed.  Pick up your burkas at the door, Tyson Chicken.  Exactly.  Tyson Chicken stinks.  Absolutely.  What's up with Fatty?  I heard they like to grab the hips of the chicken and rape them.  That's just what I heard.  I heard at Tyson they actually rape a chicken before they package it.  It's like a really passive-aggressive thing in Americans. 
[01:12:30]  I don't know if that's true.  I heard in Purdue they pat the chicken's head gently and then kill it quietly.  But in Tyson Chicken, I heard all of the blades are dull, so sometimes they have to rape the chickens to death.  That's how the chickens die, Tyson Chicken.  It's brutal.  Wow.  That should open a lot of people's eyes.  Slow and painful.  Poor little things.  Oh, they die so slowly.  And some of them just pretend to be dead so it stops.  That's unbelievable. 
[01:13:00]  What happens to the days of, well, oh, well, you want to pray?  Oh, well, why don't you go find another job?  Yeah.  That's what the old guys would do that ran these plants and these companies.  Yeah, go pray somewhere else.  Yeah.  We've got a business to run here.  Why?  And we celebrate Labor Day here.  Exactly.  Why did the workplace have to all of a sudden be this place where you have to be sensitive to people's religious beliefs? 
[01:13:30]  Whatever you want to do.  If you want to be in your cubicle and put up a little picture of Mohammed.  Well, you can't do that.  Oh, boy.  Perish the thought.  I have no idea what the hell they can do.  Put up.  Put up a picture of a bomber or something.  Whatever you want to do that involves your religion, that's fine and dandy.  But why should the whole workplace have this policy that now they have a Muslim day off? 
[01:14:00]  We're so doomed as a nation.  Doesn't anyone see that this whole country is really an empire on the downfall?  Something's got to happen.  Something's got to give.  I blame the do-gooders.  Oh.  I don't know why we're listening to the do-gooders.  We have this guilt complex, and so we just try to appease everybody.  Yeah.  Because just a bunch of guilty sissies who feel bad that things were handed to them.  We used to be a lot tougher as a country. 
[01:14:30]  I don't even mean like tough guy, like, you know, go out there and kick an ass all over the world or anything.  I just mean a tougher country.  Like, we used to be able to take things.  Right.  And just go, oh, well, that's the way it is.  Or, all right, that person said this.  Go screw yourself.  Or something.  But now it's just everything that gets so involved with apologies and this and that and sensitivity.  Ugh.  And when you're tough, you make the weak tougher.  Yeah.  Or they don't survive.  Survival of the fittest.  Now everyone has to be, you know, treated equal. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  In the workplace, in sport, everywhere now.  We've talked about all these topics over the years.  And apparently all these Muslims, Tyson, are Somalis?  They were saying that the population, the majority of the population are from Somalia.  Somalia.  That's good.  But, you know, if they want to come here and become part of the American fabric, yeah.  But Labor Day is part of that fabric.  Well, it's the same ones who want to sue because they can't wear the religious headdress.  I'm so tired.  And this would go with Christianity or Judaism. 
[01:15:30]  If your religion is somehow interfering with work or it's not complying with company policy, either put your religion down while you're working or get another job.  I'm so tired of them.  They're suing the transit authority because you can't dress.  You have to wear the uniform.  That's what you have to wear.  That's what they hire you.  You want health benefits.  Then you do what they want you to do.  Yeah.  I'm so sick of it.  Wear the uniform.  Wear the Captain Hook uniform.  Have some pride.  These boys down at IBM expect to see that uniform. 
[01:16:00]  Let's say hi to Mike in Boston listening on BCN.  Mikey.  Hey, guys.  I just want to, you know, I totally agree with this.  Why should these guys get two days off and we only have one?  You want to be an American?  You get Labor Day off.  That's it.  Put your religion aside and take the burkas off while you're driving.  I will not.  Well, I never ate Tyson chicken. 
[01:16:30]  I don't think so.  Let's go to Sean in New York.  Sean.  Chickens weigh more than the employees.  This is the kind of stuff.  Huh?  What's your own?  This is the kind of stuff that makes me want to spit acid.  I can't stand these goddamn stories.  It's plain old-fashioned communism.  I mean, at what point are we going to stand up and say, hey, look, this is America.  This isn't every year.  You know what?  You want to celebrate your country's holidays?  Go back to your goddamn country.  Why can't we have our holidays? 
[01:17:00]  God bless them.  Let them do what they want to do.  But let us have our freaking days off, too.  Their argument would be, well, we have Christmas, we have this one, we have these, we take off Jewish holidays, they would say all that, and the union agreed to it.  My problem is there's probably a lot of people in the union who want to take off Labor Day with everybody else.  Like, everybody in the country is taking off Labor Day, but some of these schmucks have to go to work and then take off October 1st. 
[01:17:30]  It's just aggravating.  Unbelievable.  What about Ramadan?  That's the end of Ramadan, I think.  I think that's what that means.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It does, right?  Yes.  All right, we got phone calls coming in for that.  And also, I wanted to get into this fat guy.  He's saying he's too fat to die.  Yeah.  And I'm sure they're going to agree with him.  Because we are so wimpy in this country.  Doomed.  We're doomed.  Oh, you're too fat to die?  Okay.  Sorry. 
[01:18:00]  Well, so, you know, this is just a lawyer finagling.  I mean, when you're going to be executing, I guess you have to try everything.  Pull out all the stops, right?  He's too fat.  He's too skinny.  He's too stupid.  I do get it.  I guess that's the lawyer's job, right?  Yeah.  I mean, he's going to save your life.  I was crawling on your own punishment.  No, it's not.  All right.  Too fat?  Too fat, yeah.  He's saying the needle wouldn't go in or something.  I don't know.  It's a wacky story.  He's scheduled to be put to death, but he's saying he's too fat because he's claiming they  would have trouble finding his veins and that his weight could diminish the effectiveness 
[01:18:30]  of one of the lethal injection drugs.  And his name is Richard Cooey.  It's an odd name.  Paul Cooey is actually the one that killed, the one who buried that little girl alive.  Oh, yeah.  His name was Paul Cooey, I believe.  That's a great family name to have then, huh?  It's amazing.  Yeah, what a...  Oh, what a...  Oof.  That's the fat one.  Yeah.  Also known as Robert Kelly.  Why is he on death row, Jimmy?  Robert Kelly.  Oh, this is why.  He's 41 years old.  He's sentenced to die for raping and murdering two young women in 86. 
[01:19:00]  But his attorneys say a drug he's taking for migraine headaches could affect the execution  process.  The drug is a seizure medication.  A seizure medication.  A seizure.  Yes.  It's just a seizure medication may create a resistance to the drug used to put inmates  to sleep so he may have some more pain and suffering.  Oh, well, we don't want that.  No.  When you rape and kill two women, you should at least be put to sleep.  Yeah, we should worry about your needs after what you did. 
[01:19:30]  That's another thing.  It's exhausting.  Just make sure you give them more drugs.  Get it over with.  How they argue lethal injection as being cruel and inhuman.  Like, and it's like we said before, the lawyers, they're going to try to pull out anything  they can.  But we're so gracious to these people.  We're so nice putting them to death.  It's going to, they go to sleep.  You go to sleep, you don't wake up.  But you know, it costs more money to put someone to death than life in prison. 
[01:20:00]  But when you look at the victims and what they must have gone through, the horror, they  get off so easy, these guys.  And how is this fat pig being allowed to put on weight on death row?  How are they not regulating his diet?  Yeah.  How is he so fat?  He's 5'4".  This is what this slob is.  He's 5'7", 267.  Dude!  You know what, dude?  You're sitting there all day.  You got no time to exercise. 
[01:20:30]  You know what, dude?  I didn't mean to kill him.  I rolled over on him.  Because he looks like Bob with his stupid goatee.  He does.  Bald.  Nice.  How about they should just shoot him in the head?  His head didn't get fat.  Well, Adam has the solution.  Why can't they just put the needle in his neck?  Yeah.  Seriously.  You can find a vein.  That would be cruel.  We got to go back to the Muslim thing.  It's got people are talking.  Ryan in Redding, what's up? 
[01:21:00]  Hey, guys.  I just want to play devil's advocate.  I'm not in any way, trust me, I'm not in any way loving Muslims or anything like that.  However, your union represents the majority.  Yes.  And you got 700 versus 500.  And if those 700 say, we want this religious holiday, the union who is paid by those people  due to their union dues has to fight for what the union members want to have.  No, no, you're right, too.  And that's what Tyson Chicken said. 
[01:21:30]  This is not a religious issue.  This is a contractual desire.  But it's just an aggravating thing that there's a lot of people who work at that plant who  now can't take off Labor Day.  I mean, I know that a lot of people in their unions have decisions made which they don't  like.  It just seems like this is a big one because this is a holiday that the whole country takes  off.  It's a nationally recognized holiday.  Can I say one more?  Okay.  Um, it's just like you look at the courthouse steps and people complaining.  One guy complains about the Ten Commandments being up there and they get taken down going 
[01:22:00]  against the majority.  This, even though it, take it and throw it to the other side and pretend that this is  Christianity for a second, which the majority of the people in this country and the country's  laws and everything were founded on.  And people would be kind of rejoicing if, say, Christmas ended up becoming a holiday instead  of something else, you know, that we used to celebrate, like Halloween or whatever.  Now, you've got to have an open mind. 
[01:22:30]  And like I said, trust me, I'm not in any way pro-Muslim.  It's just, you know, this is finally one time where you do hear majority ruling instead  of one guy whining and bitching and getting stumped and taken away from everybody else.  No, you're right, but since the majority can, like with Christmas now, you can't even call  it a Christmas holiday anymore.  It's got to be a winter holiday.  Come on, guys.  It's the winter.  Yeah, kids don't get Christmas vacations.  No.  Winter holiday.  No, no, winter festival.  Winter vacation, winter. 
[01:23:00]  We're celebrating the winter festival.  Because you can't mention the Christmas and the holiday thing anymore because that makes  it, because again, the ACLU will come after you.  And again, I understand this is a company thing and it's far better than edit, but.  I used to love the old days when you were in grammar school and you had that one weird  kid that was part of some weird religion and he had to leave the classroom and stuff.  I used to think that was hilarious.  Fantastic.  Little what's his name can't be a part of the Pledge of Allegiance.  They've taken everything away, though. 
[01:23:30]  But how great was that when you were growing up?  And he was just a strange, you know what I mean?  He was like a rare species.  It's like, oh, he's got to leave.  He's the weirdo.  He's the weirdo kid.  But now we have to include the weirdos.  It's pretty much every holiday and thing that they've taken out of school.  We talked about like Valentine's Day.  You're not allowed to just go into a lot of these schools, made policy that you can't  just come in with a couple of Valentine's Day cards for girls you like or guys, you know, 
[01:24:00]  that the girls like and just give them out to a couple of people because the rest of the  people that didn't get them feel bad.  So they either stop it completely or make it mandatory that everybody has to get one.  It takes away the whole gist of it.  It's like, yeah, you're going to learn a valuable lesson that you'll need when you grow up. 
[01:24:30]  Sometimes the girl you like ain't going to like you.  Yeah.  You don't get the cheerleader when you make cocky in your pants.  Yes, Jimmy.  That's the lesson you learn, cocky.  We're not preparing today's kids for the real world.  Simple as that.  No.  It's survival of the fittest.  And that's part of rejection.  Humans are going against survival of the fittest.  Right.  We're going to be doomed if we continue down this road.  You're growing up. 
[01:25:00]  There has to be winners.  There has to be losers.  You have to understand that, like Ann said, you're not going to get the girl.  You're not going to get the job.  Someone's going to beat you out for the job.  Rejection.  It's part of life.  And it makes you stronger as a person.  A huge part of life.  Sometimes it doesn't.  Or a school shooter.  Sometimes it makes you, yeah, very angry.  But it's part of life.  There are people that aren't.  You can't fix the whole world by taking away things like Valentine's Day cards and Christmas. 
[01:25:30]  It has to be called Winter Festival.  And then Mother's Day and Father's Day, you've got to take it away because there's alternative families.  So they don't have that anymore.  They're just destroying these institutions.  And I'm not this crazy friggin' believe me.  I'm not this crazy gung-ho America, you know, let's keep like the old days thing.  But there are certain institutions that I think really did help people grow up and taught them valuable lessons that are just being taken out of the schools and out of this country. 
[01:26:00]  And I don't know who's doing, who's like responsible for this.  Well, I don't know.  Since there's majority rules again, why would they take Mother's and Father's Day?  Look, I don't, I, gays should be able to adopt, but you're not the majority.  Right.  So why don't you just have to realize, look, as a minority group, there are certain things we have to tolerate.  Which aren't, it's not like by saying Mother's Day or Father's Day, you're ruining gay households.  It's anti-gay day. 
[01:26:30]  They don't, well, we don't want our kids to feel different.  Gee, I don't know, when they see dad and dad making out, mommy and daddy both have a beard, they feel different anyway.  They are different.  It's okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it doesn't mean you should get rid of, you know, the institutions we have in this country already.  Concho Pete, you rule from Georgia.  Concho Pete.  Here I tell you, in elementary school, we used to sit Indian style.  Today, the kids sit crisscross because they don't want to offend the Indians.  Are you kidding? 
[01:27:00]  Crisscross?  How does that offend the Indians?  How does that offend the Indians?  Was sitting like that offensive?  It was called sitting Indian style.  Well, now the teacher goes, I want everyone to sit crisscross.  Jeez, Louise.  Unbelievable.  Concho Pete.  That's odd that he picked that name.  Concho Pete was a horse out in California that used to be owned by one of the people that had a stable by us.  And Concho Pete was a stallion. 
[01:27:30]  And we watched Concho Pete mate with a female horse once.  Nice.  Holy mother of God.  Nice.  Concho Pete was quite the manly horse.  Nice.  Is he packing?  Holy.  And I'm a kid, so I was just like, oh, my God.  Booyah.  That is booyah.  Booyah to Concho Pete.  And Concho Pete just ripping up this other horse's shoulders with its hooves.  And then, but Concho Pete didn't have much staying power. 
[01:28:00]  He never did.  Horses don't.  It was just like, booyah.  It was a two-pump Concho Pete.  Yeah.  Concho Pete.  Concho Pete's a boob.  Concho Pete gets laughed at by the other horses.  Two-pump chump.  You dump already?  You dump already?  You dump already?  Yeah.  Yes, Jim, you are.  Concho Pete.  Concho Pete's like, I'm going to go get that one.  30 seconds later, Concho Pete is asleep on his feet. 
[01:28:30]  He's done.  Asleep on his feet.  Chewing some green.  All right, you got, you got Fred, the phones are way too good.  You got Fred in Boston.  Lots of Americans work on Labor Day anyway.  Yes.  You got Chris in West Palm Beach.  I'm a fat guy.  Doctor takes blood from vein in my hand.  They could easily find a vein in my hand.  Sure, thanks, fat guy.  And then we got Mike in Connecticut.  Mike, what's up?  Mike.  What's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  You guys are awesome.  Jimmy, you rock, man.  I was at the show.  You guys are awesome. 
[01:29:00]  Thank you.  But I just wanted to let you know, you know, Ant was saying about Valentine's cards.  It's when these kids come to school, if they're having a birthday party on the weekend, you  got to now send an invitation to everyone in the classroom.  Can't leave anyone out.  Right.  Yeah.  And it used to be you'd go and go, hey, come to my party, come to my party.  And some kids didn't get to go to the party.  Yeah, the fact is you don't like all the kids you're in school with.  Why do you have to have them at your house?  That's right.  And now you're dropping a lot of cash because these classrooms are 30 kids big now.  I don't know.  I don't know how the F I'm going to have kids. 
[01:29:30]  I want to have kids.  I don't know how I'm going to be able to raise them in this new in this new environment.  I don't know how super kids.  That's right.  Super kids.  Yeah, because you'll try to raise like a kid probably more traditionally because you're not  22 years old.  And but you'll be undermined every step of the way by society, by schools, by everything.  You take a kid into a store, you're not going to be able to explain half of the things that 
[01:30:00]  are going on because political correctness is just rip things apart.  It's crazy.  I don't know what happened.  It really is crazy because it doesn't prepare you for the real world.  No.  That's what school was all about, right?  Yep.  Everyone's equal, everything, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Then you get in the real world and you get destroyed.  Yeah.  That's why, you know, they were, you can't bring certain things into school anymore.  I remember show and tell. 
[01:30:30]  I could have brought in my father's gun.  Amazing.  Oh, my God.  Listen to this one.  If this is real.  Robin Jersey.  This is one of our favorite topics, by the way.  It comes up all the time, I understand.  But every time we do it, we get a little, little different, a little different look at it.  Rob Jersey, go ahead.  All right.  First of all, I want to start out with, I was having a good morning.  You guys brought this up about the Valentine's Day. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  My son is seven.  He's going into second grade.  In kindergarten, on Valentine's Day, all the kids, all they were allowed to do was hand out candy to each other.  Boys and girls, whatever.  Okay, no big deal.  Now, he was in first grade this year.  I came home from work the night before.  Valentine's Day, they had a list of boys, girls, names on a sheet.  All the boys had to hand out cards to all the boys, along with every girl in the class that says,  Happy Valentine's Day from so-and-so to so-and-so.  Now, if Valentine's Day was set up back when we were kids to be a boy-girl thing, to say, 
[01:31:30]  Okay, in life, boys like girls, girls like boys.  Now it's boys and girls all love each other, and who cares?  They're setting a standard at a young age, which is going to set a tone for something that they're not going to experience the things that we did.  And it's ridiculous.  It's unbelievable, too, because it's not special anymore if you're just handing out the same exact card to everybody.  That's basically communism.  Communism.  You know, I was one of the kids in grammar school, junior high. 
[01:32:00]  I didn't get the Valentine's Day card from the girl.  No.  I just didn't.  That's life.  Guess what?  I would go to school hoping, hoping, hoping, and I went home disappointed.  It happens.  My son's teacher is a guy.  He's a really great guy, great teacher.  I spoke to him about it.  They are forced by the Board of Education to do this.  If any teachers are caught not allowing all the kids to hand out to each other all this stuff, they get reprimanded. 
[01:32:30]  They get cut.  Yeah, right.  That's all I got guys punching out.  Well, I don't blame the teachers.  It goes way, way above the teachers, because you talk to the teachers.  They're like, look, we have no choice.  We have to do this, or we're going to lose our job.  It's stupid.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah, it is stupid.  JR in Georgia, let's just hang the death row guy.  We've got, like, three stories going at the same time.  Hang him.  That's a lot of crane.  Yeah.  Oh, boy, they have problems hanging fat people.  Warren, North Carolina.  Yeah, their heads usually pop off.  Perfect.  Horrible. 
[01:33:00]  Dead.  Yeah.  Well, same end result.  I'm not going for an odd, because I didn't get a Valentine's Day car.  I'm just saying, though.  That's just part of life.  There were plenty of Valentine's Days.  I didn't get crap.  Right.  And I was all brokenhearted, because I wanted to, you know, I brought one in for one of these  girls, and then she's, like, dishing them out to everybody else, and I kind of wait.  Right.  And I don't get one, so I just threw mine away.  Right.  So I wouldn't look like an idiot.  See, you remember rejection like that.  It helps you in life.  I can't wait to, like, see some of these wimpy kids in the next, like, ten years. 
[01:33:30]  They'll be in a bar, and they just assume everyone likes me, man, because, you know,  that's what I learned in school.  You go up to a chick, and she just openly laughs at you and says, get out of here, loser.  Butch, this is the real world.  This isn't your cute sixth grade class anymore.  But I learned in school we're all loved equally.  You're ugly, you smell, and I don't want anything to do with you.  Yeah.  But that's not what they taught me in school.  Ugh.  I'm sick of it.  Uh, why is Tug of War now called the Big Pull? 
[01:34:00]  Mike.  Wow.  Because the war thing is terrible.  Oh.  My, uh, my girlfriend is a first grade teacher, and she's telling me that they had to rename  Tug of War the Big Pull.  Because Tug of War was too violent.  Well, that makes sense.  The Big Pull.  That's exactly what they're doing.  Was that the coolest game in gym class?  Huh?  Was that the coolest game in gym class?  Tug of War ruled.  It was definitely cool, man.  But, you know, the Chinese are coming, and you can just go, well, what's this war thing? 
[01:34:30]  Maybe you could just do the Big Pull.  No.  To them, Tug of War, I'm sure.  They're not changing anything over there.  Yeah, I'm sure the government is paying attention.  Your cute little kid that's doing the Big Pull.  Guess what?  He's going to war when he turns 18.  You dummies.  Carlin was so great the way he just dissected and attacked these baby boomers.  And he completely deconstructed them as the little sissies that they are, the overprivileged, 
[01:35:00]  handed everything to them sissies.  And I loved the way he would attack them.  And he said they were soft, fruity people, and they're raising soft, fruity kids.  And that's exactly what it is.  They're just a bunch of little bitches, and they're raising – they can't even teach  kids at home, like, look, if you get rejected, it's okay.  And you build your self-esteem from other ways.  Because everyone – it's like this dishonest thing.  Everyone has to pretend to like everyone.  That's not realistic.  Jimmy, I was going to say the exact same thing.  When I got rejection in school, you just learn different ways around that.  You learn, okay, maybe I'm not good at this because I got rejected. 
[01:35:30]  I'm going to try something else.  You know, all right, this girl doesn't like me.  Maybe this girl does because maybe she's more like me.  You know what I mean?  You learn from rejection.  That's right.  It made you a psychopath, him an alcoholic, and me a sex addict.  Maybe this worked out nicely.  I found –  I'm paranoid, too.  I know.  Wait, awful examples.  I turned out okay.  Meanwhile, I'm in therapy because I can't stop with Craigslist and pornography. 
[01:36:00]  I'm armed like a militia.  You wear guns around your own house.  You can't – the plane has to be on the tarmac before you pack a bag.  Almighty, we're all disasters.  It does drive everyone nuts.  Have you packed yet?  I know, man.  You know, the car's not going to be here for another 20 minutes.  And throw clothes in a bag at the last second.  I don't know what that comes from.  We've got to continue with this.  The phone calls coming in are amazing.  Everyone gets trophies in sports. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, the no winners, no losers in the sports, high school, elementary school sports.  No winners or losers.  Just play the game.  Don't keep score.  We'll get into more of this stuff.  Ed in Cleveland.  Judge here wants to get rid of death penalty.  We don't even need to take your phone call because guess what?  In another few years, there will not be a death penalty in this country officially.  Well, we have a death penalty in New York, but this is how they get around it.  They just don't kill anybody.  No.  So it keeps kind of both sides happy. 
[01:37:00]  It doesn't matter how heinous the crime is.  They will not.  We've had a prosecutor that just will not try a case with the death penalty.  Robert Johnson?  I don't know, but we've had the death penalty for how long in this state?  And we haven't used it once.  Since Pataki got in.  About a dozen years.  All right.  At least a dozen years we haven't killed one person.  That's what they do now.  All right, well, we have a death penalty, but this is how we get around it.  We just don't kill anybody.  So nothing bad has happened in 12 years, I guess. 
[01:37:30]  No one's done a crime that was death penalty worthy.  If I was the president or whatever, I would just, if you have a death penalty in your state,  I would force them to use it once a month.  Wow, you have to use it.  Mandatory death penalty.  But force them, like once a month.  Sorry.  I don't care.  I don't care if you get down to, like, you know, jaywalkers.  You have to use it once a month.  Kill someone.  Right.  I want to see someone die.  Right.  Don't humor me with this fake death penalty.  Oh, New York State's got the death penalty. 
[01:38:00]  No, we don't.  We don't have the death penalty in this state.  We really don't.  More of your phone calls.  877-212-ON-A.  Stay there.  Let's go right to the phones.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We got Cheech and Chong.  They're going to be on in a few minutes here.  What the hell are they up to?  They got back together because, uh, well, they got back together.  I thought they hated each other. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  That's what I heard over the years.  Anyway, let's go to Dan-O in Kentucky.  Dan-O.  Hey, good morning, fellas.  Happy birthday to me.  Thanks, fella.  What's up, Dan-O?  Hey.  Hey, I got barred from my kid's, uh, soccer game, man.  Why?  Yeah, uh, well, she went to kick a goal and she missed the ball.  She's a little bitty kid, right?  Or was it this time?  Anyway, she went to kick the ball, she missed the ball, and she fell right on her butt.  And everybody giggled.  But when they giggled, she started crying. 
[01:39:00]  Well, the coach's like, oh, come here, come here.  And I go, hey, Mark, come here, kid.  And she comes over to me, and I go, hey, look, these people are laughing, because all week  long, they fall on their butt, and this time it didn't happen to them.  I said, get out there, give it as good as you got it, and bring the pain.  Now, get out there.  Well, she went out there.  Yeah.  You know, you're playing competitive sports.  Well, anyway, she gets out there, and all these parents are looking at me like I got  lobsters crawling out of my ears, right?  So, she goes out there, and she wins the game, and she goes, hey, Daddy, did we win? 
[01:39:30]  And I go, you won, kid.  And I said, the score was 6-5.  And then the coach goes, we don't keep score here.  I looked at my kid, and I go, hey, let me tell you something.  In life, everybody keeps score all the time.  And then they called me at my house, like a pack of Nancy's, and told me not to come  back.  This reminds me of the Mean Joe Green commercial, where he throws the jersey here, kid.  Catch you, kid.  Yeah.  Yeah, look, I mean, they don't keep score because they don't seem to understand how 
[01:40:00]  to teach their stupid kids that it is okay to lose as long as you're putting an effort  out there.  Like, they don't seem to understand that it's okay to come in second and to celebrate winning  and work.  They just don't know how to teach their kids that.  They're such dummies.  You could do your best and still lose.  Yeah.  Let's do a speed round, because the phones are unbelievable on this topic.  Carol in Jersey.  Oh, we lost Carol.  Now, I guess there's a list of approved snacks that you're allowed to bring to school now. 
[01:40:30]  Maybe she could call back.  Let's go to Ryan in Jersey.  Ryan.  Darn peanut allergy.  Ryan.  Hey.  How's it going?  Hey.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hey.  I'm a coach.  I'm a high school coach, but the parents got too nuts.  I mean, we had a BS no-cut policy on the sports teams in high school.  So we would have coaches with teams like soccer, 30 kids, you know, on the GV team, and he was  told by the athletic director, you've got to get everybody in the games. 
[01:41:00]  I mean, you can only see 11 people on a team on a soccer field, yet he had to find some  way to get 30 people in, or else he'd get calls from the parents.  The AD wouldn't even back him up.  So it's good and bad.  Wait, basically a no-cut policy?  That was part of playing sports in school.  The coach would put the list up, and you're like panicking, like, did I make this cut?  Did I make it?  And sometimes you didn't make the cut.  But if you made it, you felt really good.  Hell yeah.  But they want everyone to feel good. 
[01:41:30]  It was a great accomplishment, because guess what?  The kids that usually made the sports teams were the ones that really wanted to be on the  sports team.  They were training in the summertime.  They were going to the sports camps.  And now what?  Now you have to be considered equal with the fat kid that just decides last minute, I think  I want to try the soccer thing.  You know what's amazing?  It's always the physical activities, it seems.  Like, they're not willing to do that intellectually.  Like, how about this?  How about everybody gets to go to any college they want to go to? 
[01:42:00]  Right, yeah.  How about no more admissions tests?  Right.  No more SATs, no more admissions.  How about that?  Or is it only with sports, where half of these nerds couldn't succeed?  I sucked at sports.  Played baseball a little bit, but I was never good.  You just spun around in the outfield.  I was a hell of a dancer.  I mean, quite a pretty dance prodigy.  Sure, I won't take that away from myself.  Why don't we take it to the next step?  So then you graduate college and you decide what job you want.  I want to be CEO of Citadel Broadcasting.  No, this is college.  No good.  You probably get in right away. 
[01:42:30]  You see that computer you're on?  We have that because Bill Gates probably got cut from a sports team.  Yeah.  He was a nerd.  He was a nerd, Sam.  He couldn't play sports.  Here's Chris in Connecticut.  Chris.  Chris.  Listen to this one.  Hey, I'm all for letting people live their lives the way they want, but my daughter,  when she was in fifth grade, they spent a week on some special class teaching that  it's okay to be gay.  That it's so that homosexual couples are totally normal.  And fine, gays are gays, but I don't want my kids growing up thinking that's okay to 
[01:43:00]  be gay.  I don't want gay kids.  As long as they're just teaching the girls.  That's fine.  Well, yeah, I have a son that's going into fifth grade this year, and I'm going to flip  if they have that same class.  Wait, they spent a week on this?  Yeah, well, it wasn't all day, but they spent like an hour a day.  It was part of their health education class, teaching them about...  I mean, if you throw it in, a little sprinkle of that, whatever, but...  How should they...  Let me ask you a question.  I'm not a parent, but okay.  How should they deal with that? 
[01:43:30]  Because, like, look, the reality is there's a lot of gay people in the country.  I mean, that's whether you like it or not, whether other people like it or not, that's  a reality.  What do you think they should do with that one?  I think fifth grade's a little bit early.  Are they teaching fifth graders about other sexual things?  You know what I mean?  I think fifth grade's a little bit...  Do they teach them how to talk Greek?  Well, do they teach them...  Let me say, well, is it sexual preference, or is it because at that age you can already  start to see it?  Like, you know what I mean?  Like, the boys that are like, ah, and the other kids start ragging on them. 
[01:44:00]  I don't know.  Do they teach you sex ed in fifth grade?  I don't even remember.  I don't think so.  I look at it as they're kind of promoting it.  That's why I look at it.  Dude, I am...  Promoting the gay?  I have no doubt you're born with it.  And I learned that by watching my nephew's sports teams, and no, I'm not talking about  my nephew.  It is so effing obvious when you see a bunch of little boys together playing little league  baseball, because every father wants their kid to be in the major leagues. 
[01:44:30]  It all starts there.  And you see the kid doing ballerina moves, instead of getting down into position, getting  ready for the ball if it's hit toward him.  He'll be doing that later in life.  Can't be bothered by...  Getting in position for the ball.  Booyah!  How about...  Oh, we lost a really good one.  In California, they don't give out F's in this certain school district.  They give out ends.  Oh, Jesus.  And I forgot...  That's illegal.  Wow.  It certainly is.  I forgot what... 
[01:45:00]  What do they do?  Work?  House chores.  I forgot what the end really stands for.  Needs improvement, probably, because I would always get...  Yes.  Yes.  I would always do that in conduct.  Yes.  One time, I got a...  The best conduct rate I ever got was a C- and the teacher wrote, in parentheses, gift,  next to it.  Yeah.  Gift.  This is a gimme, ass.  John from Connecticut is begging me to read his instant feedback.  It's a good one.  He's a teacher and a coach. 
[01:45:30]  Most schools are not allowed to post cut lists.  This is what I remember growing up.  I tried to get on a bunch of sports teams, and some of them I made, and some of them I didn't.  And seeing that cut list, you would go home depressed if you didn't make the team.  You know?  But it made you work harder.  Yeah.  At that sport, and then if you made it the next year, it was like, look what I did.  All that hard work paid off.  That's why we're not going to be competitive as a nation.  But anyway, he goes, most schools are not allowed to post cut lists anymore.  You could cut a kid, but you have to have a private meeting, hold his hand, and explain 
[01:46:00]  why you didn't make the team.  I don't mind that as much.  Oh, come on.  No, I don't mind that.  The humiliation of thinking you made the team, and everyone else is jumping up and down,  and you have to saunter away.  Yeah, walk away.  I just walk away.  I don't mind that.  You've got to sit the kid down and tell him, look, you know, all right, that's fine.  As long as you can't boot the little worthless nothing.  All right, let's go to my record.  Mike in New York.  Mike A.  Hey, what's going on, guys? 
[01:46:30]  Always.  Hi, Mike.  I was getting back to soccer with the little kids.  They had a no cheering day.  It's a silent game, but you're not even allowed to cheer if they score or anything.  Why?  It's ridiculous.  I have no idea.  My wife was cheering.  She was getting yelled at.  We all love adulation.  Yeah.  Why would you even want to play?  Maybe because they see the end result.  What happens with the professionals is that they riot in Europe and set people on fire.  I bet so as to discourage one child getting more cheers than another. 
[01:47:00]  Probably.  It's like, oh, you know, you scored your parents and everybody else is cheering,  and then the poor spastic kid that can't even bring the ball downfield is not getting any cheers and adulation.  Let's go to Chuck in Stanford.  Chuck.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, buddy.  As long as I said to let you know, I'm glad to be a dad the next coming week, my first son,  and I'm excited to be a dad, but I'm scared crap in regards to the fact that he's going to grow up in a world 
[01:47:30]  where, you know, be scared everybody's a winner, not going to learn how to lose.  I'm not going to learn.  It's going to be all, I mean, granted, it's my responsibility as a parent.  But, you know, when other parents are ciling their child and making sure he feels like a winner, you know,  it's what it is.  I'm the way I am because of rejection and losing and growing up and doing everything that's part of life.  Just like, dude, dude, here it is.  To counteract society, just beat him at every turn.  Just smack him with a strap, the back of your hand, just beat your child, and that'll counteract 
[01:48:00]  all the crap that they're doing in school, I think.  The first part of his call was dumped out of, but he's going to be a father, and he's  really scared of what's going on out there.  I've been thinking about this a lot lately myself.  I'm like, how do you do it?  And when you're used to the old school ways, that I'm completely convinced is the way to  do it.  I'm a 25-year-old guy, and I'm an Italian boy, too.  I mean, growing up as a kid, my mom carried a wooden spoon in her purse whenever I'm public.  You know, if I did something wrong, that spoon came out. 
[01:48:30]  I never got hit with it.  But, man, I was scared of my mom's purse.  You know, and nowadays, it's like, oh, that's child abuse and this, that, and the other thing.  It's like, how can I justify disciplining my kids like that, and especially, and look  who's going to possibly come in the White House in the next couple of years, you know?  Next couple of months, I should say.  That doesn't matter.  You know, that doesn't matter.  He's actually calling for more parental responsibility in the black community.  I got no problem with that.  The problem is, it's like, there's no balance.  Like, Colin Quinn has a really funny bit about, like, how there's no more winning and losing 
[01:49:00]  anymore.  And, you know, it's something along the lines of, I'm going to butcher it, about how kids are  all going to be, like, just standing in a big circle, throwing a red ball to each other,  singing Sarah McLachlan songs.  It's a really funny line he had.  But there is, like, a point where kids were awful at one point.  It's like, how do you, like, kind of counteract some of the awfulness?  Because kids do torture each other, and they humiliate each other.  And a lot of times, they're trying to protect kids who do have garbage parents.  Because just because you have garbage parents, it's not, you shouldn't have an awful life.  So it's like, all right, where's the balance between trying to make a kid feel a little 
[01:49:30]  bit better?  Because really, none of it's important.  Whether, you know what I mean?  Like, I know I'm kind of going the other way, but it's like, you really shouldn't feel  that bad if you couldn't kick a ball into a net.  But that does wreck a kid's self-esteem.  Because if he's got awful parents, and like, well, the parents should be better.  Yeah, but that's not the kid's fault.  It's like, where's the balance between just trying to help kids out and make them feel  a little better and being a bunch of fags?  Do encourage them to try other things that they might be good at.  Punching bag?  Well, whatever.  Laughing stock? 
[01:50:00]  I don't want to be a laughing stock.  Is there a job for that?  Laughing stock?  There's a million things you could try that you might be good at, though.  You know?  Why?  Don't.  It just dumbs down the sports and all that crap.  Should every kid be allowed to join the chess club?  How about this?  Hell no, man.  Well, of course not.  Every kid, whether you can play or not, it's in the chess club.  And then you could be going for the championship, but you lose because he goes, I want to move  it this way.  And he takes the night and he slides it three to the left and they go, that's not the way  it works, you idiot. 
[01:50:30]  But they have to give him a little trophy anyway.  Let me hang on it.  Let's go to Bill.  Bill, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, I used to coach in the Little League where every kid had to have the same pair  of cleats and the same gloves, but nobody felt left out.  You know what I'm saying?  Oh, really?  Same equipment?  That's communism.  I know.  It is communism.  How are you supposed to make fun of the kid that had the bad glove?  I had the bad glove.  Did you have the bad glove?  Yeah.  I had the bad sneakers.  Unbelievable.  We couldn't afford the nice sneaks when I was playing basketball back in the day. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, do you have those really bad little skippies?  I had the knockoffs that almost looked like the real thing.  Yeah.  It was Nike with like a couple C's in there or something.  I don't know.  It was just Nikki shoes.  Yeah, something.  I always wanted black high top Pia Flyers.  Yeah.  And my mother would never get them for me because she said they were N shoes.  And she wasn't going to have her kid running around in N shoes. 
[01:51:30]  Wonderful.  Needs to improve shoes.  Yes, exactly.  Needs to improve shoes.  She thought only the N's wore them.  And she would throw that word around like crazy.  Oh, God forbid I got like five bucks for my birthday and a card and I just wanted to go out and spend it.  She wouldn't just let me go out and spend it on candy or some other crap because I was being N rich.  Unbelievable. 
[01:52:00]  It's kind of like Enron.  I would love to hear your mom's take on Obama.  Oh, God.  Well, no, my mom is censored.  She's completely different now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When people get older, like they change.  When she was, you know, a youngster like that, when I was a kid and she's raising us.  Oh, my God.  Were her political views and everything else so much different.  Wow.  Now, you know, it's she she would never say anything like that.  But back then, oh, that word was everything. 
[01:52:30]  What do I look?  She used to say this.  I'd ask her for something like, oh, could you do this or that?  And she goes, what do I look?  Two shades darker than you.  It's like she would just make like black jokes all the time.  Little black quips.  It's an older generation thing, too.  They just didn't know any better.  Well, they knew better.  I told my just so racist.  I told my I told my grandma story, right?  What did she say?  Oh, no.  My grandma was like the most religious person, the nicest person. 
[01:53:00]  Just nothing but love in her in her heart and soul.  Without a doubt.  I miss her.  But we had a black girl living with us for a little while.  Oh, boy.  Well, it was part of that church thing.  You know, you got to like show the city kids what the suburbs are all about.  What the burbs are about.  It's called casing the area pretty much is what they were doing.  Oh, wait.  Send me out to the country.  Wait, that's not the black girl that lived with us, though.  And then my parents were illegally renting rooms to pay bills. 
[01:53:30]  And we took in a black girl.  And my mom comes home and my grandma was over.  She told my mom that the colored girl upstairs needed her.  The colored girl needs you.  I remember my mom getting so pissed and going, her name is Shaniqua or whatever the hell it was.  Yeah.  Back then it was probably like Mary.  But my grandma, you know, the colored girl needs you. 
[01:54:00]  She has to ask you something.  Different generation.  What are you going to do?  She didn't know any better.  Yeah.  We got to clear the field for our interview with Cheech and Chong.  Clear the field.  Our kid is homeschooled because of this.  Kevin in New Mexico.  Where's all this coming from anyway?  I don't know.  This is all teachers.  Yeah, this doesn't teach our kids about real life.  We've said that.  When I was in high school, we had to hug each other. 
[01:54:30]  That's Chris and Jersey.  I like that.  Parents need to take a stand.  I agree with that.  I really do agree that the parents need to take a stand on some of this stuff.  Yeah, but the parents of the weak and awful kids are the ones who are going to stand up and fight back.  Yeah.  They don't want to have to teach their kids anything about losing or being a little douche, which is what they are.  Yeah.  All right.  Nerds, hall monitors.  God, we hang up with the phones and then, bam, everything.  The phones take their place immediately.  We've got to take a break, and we'll talk to Cheech and Chong next.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We've got to go right to the phones.  We've got two big stars on the phone.  Comedy legends.  Comedy legends.  That's right, Jimmy.  Cheech and Chong.  Hey, guys.  Hey, how are you doing?  Good.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, I've got a tattoo.  I need to fit it on my member.  And if you're going to put a Mercedes, you can drive me over.  You've got a beer while I'm doing it?  We couldn't hear you.  What do you say? 
[01:55:30]  How about you try that again?  Yeah, the sub-recepts is a little messed up.  Yeah.  What?  We couldn't hear you.  Look at this.  They're all blown out in the morning.  Hey, man.  A lot of people are really psyched.  You guys are touring together.  How many years since you guys have actually been out on the road doing gigs?  27.  27 years.  Maybe 30.  I thought you guys hated each other, though.  I'm kind of confused that you guys are back together.  Well, it's one of the conditions that we're at parole that we get together. 
[01:56:00]  It's a money thing.  Oh, okay.  There you go.  Oh, that's it.  You guys know what we're talking about.  Of course.  You feel like...  Yes, it was all healed.  Hey, look.  Bands do it.  I mean, a lot of bands.  Motley Crue, they've been at each other's throats for a long time.  And if four of them can do it, you guys can certainly...  Are you going to travel separately, or are you guys going to kind of just try to hang?  I'm going to come in a day later than him.  Every Sunday.  Yeah.  Cheech on Friday and Chong on Saturday. 
[01:56:30]  What exactly...  Can I ask you guys, I mean, we all...  What exactly was happening with you?  Because, I mean, you made some legendary films.  And was it creative differences?  Or what really happened where you guys just started to not like each other?  I got sick of each other.  We got rich.  Really?  Yeah.  You can't make a rich Mexican do diddly.  Was it like creative differences?  Like you wanted a film to be this way, and Chong, you wanted it to be that way? 
[01:57:00]  Or was it just...  You just got sick of looking at each other's faces?  All of the above.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow.  It was a learning experience.  Cheech had to go find out that he can do other things, and I had to go out and do other things.  So you started doing more stand-up, and Cheech, you continued.  You kept getting a lot of roles.  You've done a lot of stuff, a lot of films and stuff.  And what made you say, look, I'd kind of like to work with this person again?  Uh... 
[01:57:30]  My second divorce.  What?  God wanted us back together again.  All right, so you think it was God, and Cheech, you think it was the fact that the ex might  have taken a little more than she should have?  Yeah, well, we all do.  It's not all so nice.  It's like a tattoo you need faded, you know?  And instead of just getting it recolored, you just kind of have it, you know, I guess,  cull it over, right?  Yeah, exactly.  Actually, my son, you know, he was looking forward to the inheritance, and he wanted 
[01:58:00]  to boost it up a bit, you know?  Oh, did he see how the money has waned a little bit over the years?  Yeah, yeah.  You know, all of that, yeah.  So get back out there.  Get my fortune back.  Yeah.  Well, not only that, but, you know, if we don't do it now, it won't happen, you know?  Man, the kids of famous people could be just awful.  No, the Ted Williams story is one of my favorites, where that awful son of his made Ted just sit  there and sign things all day long. 
[01:58:30]  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Legendary, man.  He would go over to Pop's house and make Pop sign all day long, because the son, you  know, couldn't hit a baseball and needed to get, you know, to pay his bills.  You know, that's it right there.  Now, you nailed it, you know, I got a bunch of kids like that, you know?  That just, that really didn't quite follow in the footsteps.  No, luckily all my kids have jobs.  Hey, you guys still smoke dope? 
[01:59:00]  I would assume Chong does.  Every once in a while.  And Cheech, you still partake?  Yeah, every once in a while, sure.  That was part of our agreement, you know?  He has to.  Hey, are you guys going to, like, do anything?  Like, I know everyone's probably asking you this, but are you going to do old bits,  or do you have anything new, or just are you going to kind of, like a musician, just  kind of just run down the classics?  Oh, no.  We're going to do everything word for word that we used to do.  Word for word, huh?  We're going to do some Carlin stuff, because he's not using it anymore. 
[01:59:30]  Right on, Cheech.  How about a movie?  Do you guys have any film plans?  Yeah, I'm going to go see Escape the Witch Mouse.  Thought he meant, you know, making them.  We won't talk about movies yet, you know, because we want to start fighting again.  I think Chong blew it, though.  I heard that you guys were supposed to reunite for a film, I think it was in 2003, somewhere 
[02:00:00]  around there, right?  I think it was 2000, 2003, 2004, and 2005.  Yeah, but then Chong, you know, got in a bit of trouble with that drug paraphernalia.  Oh, yeah.  Cheech made me do it.  Yeah, he didn't swallow the dough fast enough.  He was swallowing bongs.  That's a little harder.  Those were the dumbest charges I ever heard.  Stupid.  Really?  How was it the first time you had to explain to everybody in jail what you were in there 
[02:00:30]  for?  It was fun.  Yeah, it was fun.  A bong instead of, not even the weed.  Yeah, they must have laughed at you.  I thought I said bomb.  What a railroading you got.  Really?  No, they thought I said bomb, so they left me alone.  Hey, did you guys have any, like, was there any, when you guys were split, was there  any, like, jealousy between the two?  Like, were you, like, you know, pissed that Cheech was doing certain things?  Or were you kind of, like, would you ever look at what Chong was doing and go, like, ugh?  Listen, I was sitting in a Holiday Inn in Sarasota, Florida, about to go on, and Cheech 
[02:01:00]  was on television on Nash Bridges, and I didn't feel the least bit jealous.  I don't know, huh?  Yeah, there were a few years there, you know.  What are you going to do?  You know, Chong is sitting there getting busted for selling bongs, and, you know, Cheech  is in Quentin Tarantino movies.  Yeah, basically what Anthony is saying, maybe you should have taken a few years off from  smoking out of that bong there, Chong. 
[02:01:30]  Well, why?  Why?  Well, look what happened to Cheech.  I assumed that he might have put the pot down for a few years.  Listen to that.  You can do all you want.  No, I know what you're getting at, guys, but it's not going to happen, because I love  Cheech, and he loves me, and we're going to go out, and we're going to make a lot of  money.  You actually...  I've also got 150 hours of community service wiped out. 
[02:02:00]  Hey, well, because Chong, you always stayed with live performance.  Like, you've been doing gigs for a lot of years.  You've been on stage constantly.  And, Cheech, do you feel any, like, any hesitation going back out in front of a live audience?  Because you did a lot of stuff acting, but have you been in front of, like, a comedy audience  in a long time?  Yeah, every once in a while, I would go out.  I would take some young comics out, and we'd go and do some dates.  And so I still have, you know, stage experience.  And we were out for so long together.  Yeah.  It's, like, part of your DNA, you know?  Did you miss that, man?  Did you miss, like, even if you guys were fighting, did you miss performing on a stage? 
[02:02:30]  No, I missed.  I missed going around the country and seeing what the country was like all the time.  Yeah, just kind of coming in and doing a gig and hanging in the city?  Well, just getting the pulse of the country, you know, because you're in Atlanta  one day, Philadelphia the next, New York, L.A., and you can see what's happening in the  country all the time.  Well, we're a national show.  What's your favorite city, you think?  The one we're in that day.  Yeah, there you go.  Well, you guys, just to let people know, too, it's called Cheech and Chong Light of 
[02:03:00]  America.  It's a comedy tour, and tickets are on sale this Friday, which is August the 8th, at 4.20  p.m., which is a very odd choice.  Oh, I get it.  Well, we think, you know, everybody's cutting, takes off early from work on Friday at 4.20  and they're on their vacation.  Somebody has a good publicist.  There you go, you know, and we weren't born every minute.  So, Cheech and Chong, it's September 5th, you start in Ottawa, Ontario, and this tour, 
[02:03:30]  this part of the tour goes all the way up to the Paramount Theater in Denver.  And what's the website?  People can go on, oh, CheechandChongTour.com.  Dot com, and they're actually going to be here in Atlantic City near the New York area  and in Philly, one in September, one in December.  Just go to that website for dates or Ticketmaster.  Uh-huh, and buy a lot of tickets.  I'm sure you guys will sell well.  Do you have any fear that you're not going to sell?  Like, is there any, like, feeling back like we're not going to be relevant or people  aren't going to want to come see us?  Not at all.  Oh, yeah, there's always that fear.  No matter what you do, you know, nothing's a slam dunk. 
[02:04:00]  That's why we're up at 5 in the morning doing radio stuff.  No, I think they're going to be very successful with this.  I think a lot of people have been looking forward to something like this for a very long time.  I was one of those guys that grew up listening to those comedy CDs, man.  Well, thank you very much.  You guys were quite successful with that.  Hey, are you guys thinking of doing another one?  Another one?  We haven't even started this one.  Well, like, you know, an old-school, like, comedy album from Cheech and Chong. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, yeah, but we're going to do an album, not a CD.  We're going to do a vinyl.  An old-school?  Yeah.  So you can scratch to us.  Yeah.  Definitely film.  I'm sure you guys will be filming these dates, but you should be filming this whole tour.  Yeah, we are.  You know, maybe there's some kind of a reality show.  I mean, a reality show, there's so many of them.  I think at least one with you guys or some kind of a reality thing would at least be interesting.  Unreality.  What's that?  Unreality.  Well, it would be fun to watch you guys kind of getting along and then just see if it unravels 
[02:05:00]  or if it stays together.  I mean, that's the...  You guys love train wrecks, don't you?  True.  Yeah.  Everybody does, though.  Of course.  Everybody likes to take a look.  Look at Van Halen.  People were like, oh, the tour's not going to make it.  They're not going to last.  And all of a sudden, they didn't.  And apparently, they're getting along well.  Yeah.  Hey, you know, we actually, we've been on the road for about four years now.  We just call ourselves the Eagles.  And Chong, you're actually coming to New York.  You're taping an interview unmasked with Ron Bennington. 
[02:05:30]  I think you're coming next week.  Yeah, you'll have...  Yeah, to promote my book.  Yeah, you're going to have a real good time with Ron.  He's great.  Is he a good guy?  Yeah, yeah.  He's an awesome guy.  You'll love him.  He does a great interview.  And, you know, they kind of take the mask off of the comics and just see what really makes  you tick underneath and what inspires you.  It's great.  It's really...  It's an interesting interview.  He's a big fan of the crying comedian, so make sure you cry a little.  He likes making people cry.  Huh?  And we're not going to be on your show?  Yeah, you'll be on the show.  Sure.  But that's an hour-long interview. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, no, you can come in and do our show live, Chong.  Yeah, I'll drop in.  Yeah, we would love to have you.  Hey, who made the first move to get back between you two?  Like, who actually took the first step towards the other one?  Was it your turn or my turn?  It was the very first time, I think, I don't know, was that Radon?  Yeah, Radon, your daughter.  Yeah.  Really?  See, she's like, you know, hey, Pop, get back together, get some money. 
[02:06:30]  What the hell are you doing?  She had a script she wanted us to do.  In fact, it was a very good script.  But I don't know, actually, who did, you know.  I think it was Radon.  Yeah, it came close.  We were assigned to do a movie with New Line, and then I got busted.  Yeah.  And then I was on probation, so I couldn't do anything anyway.  And then it sort of evolved.  And then we did Aspen.  We did a little, you know, Q&A in Aspen. 
[02:07:00]  And that felt good.  I mean, it felt weird.  Then I won a lottery, and who gives a crap.  Yeah, but we did a little show last weekend in La Jolla, and it was such a high.  The audience went absolutely nuts.  Were you unannounced, or was it supposed to be a teaching challenge show, or you guys just kind of showed up?  It was unannounced.  It was Shelby, my wife. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, by the way, is opening the show.  She's going to open our show, Shelby.  And Shelby and I were working in La Jolla, and she showed up unannounced for four days.  And it was a treat for everybody.  Of course.  It was just advertised as Tommy and Shelby, and a real special guest named C.M. might show up.  Carl Malden?  That's okay.  Hey, let me, did it bother you guys, when you separated, like, you guys both wanted to find out, like, what can I do? 
[02:08:00]  But you were always going to be Cheech of Cheech and Chong, even though you were Richard Mariner.  You were always going to be Chong.  Did that ever bother you guys?  It was kind of hard to separate yourself from the team?  No, I liked it.  This is Chong.  No, it was, it was my, I always been a calling card, you know, like, uh, the Earl of Luxburg, you know?  Right.  Chong of Cheech and Chong.  Yeah, no, I mean, you'd never want to get rid of that.  I mean, it was, you'd never going to get rid of it, and it's something to be very proud of, you know? 
[02:08:30]  After all, you know, you do other things, but you still want that in your resume.  Well, you guys, a lot of people are psyched you getting back together.  I mean, I would love to go see you.  I mean, uh, you were nominated for four Grammys, um, and, uh, you know, obviously, uh, you know, you made millions of dollars at your films.  The first film made $100 million at the box office, Up in Smoke.  And, uh, there are a bunch of dates going on sale this Friday, August 8th, 4.20 p.m.  I'm sure Ticketmaster will have them.  We'll go to CheechandChongTour.com.  But we'd love you guys to come in when you're in town and, uh, promote any dates you have in the area. 
[02:09:00]  Absolutely.  We'd love to be in them.  So, uh, good luck, guys.  We'll definitely see you when you come around.  Starts September 5th and ends December 20th at the tour.  All right, man.  All right, take care.  Thanks, guys.  CheechandChong.  Uh, CheechandChongTour.com.  It'd be kind of cool to have those guys in.  I mean, uh, I would certainly go see them live.  Yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  Just to see.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  They've had, I'll be honest, they've had, you know, some pretty funny stuff back when the whole drug thing was funny.  And, uh, and they've had some pretty bad stuff. 
[02:09:30]  Like, I've seen some stage stuff, uh, that was videotaped from a long time ago.  And it's just like, oh, my God, does this ever end?  You know, so.  I wasn't going to tell them that.  That's why I would have taken it.  They don't seem to care.  I think they know that some of this stuff probably sucked.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  But Tommy's been performing the whole time, though.  So it's almost like he's probably more the veteran performer now.  Maybe live, yeah.  Yeah, but, I mean, Cheech has made, uh, movies and done TV shows and stuff, so.  Let's not fight. 
[02:10:00]  All right, listen.  Okay, Jimmy.  It would be funny if the show got ruined by the Cheech and Chong interview.  Yeah, if we'd just start fighting, punching each other.  Well, it kind of got ruined by the Cheech and Chong interview.  Who are you kidding?  Boring.  Exactly.  Oh, God.  Ah, of course, of course.  They're legends.  Well, they were honest with us at least about not liking each other for a while.  I think they need more interesting in studio.  It's a little easier to have.  We almost had another A show, but today I've got to give it a B plus now.  Because of that.  B plus for today.  But a fine booyah to everyone. 
[02:10:30]  A booyah.  Listen, we've got to show Jimmy booyah when we get to the other side.  And we'll explain booyah on this side maybe tomorrow.  Listen, we were talking about kids and how they're being brought up, and it's kind of wimpy,  and everyone is equal, and this and that, blah, blah, blah, right?  For the people that are still with us.  Well, Charles J. Sykes.  I want to get this in before we get out of here.  He did a book called Dumbing Down Our Kids, Why American Children Feel Good About Themselves But Can't Read, Write, or Add.  And he's got a bunch of rules, and I think we can relate to a lot of these rules, 
[02:11:00]  and it's a lot of the things we have said when this topic comes up.  Rule one, life is not fair.  Get used to it.  But in school, it is, right?  Yeah.  Rule two, the world won't care about your self-esteem.  The world will expect you to accomplish something before you feel good about yourself.  Huh?  Yeah.  Rule three, you will not make $40,000 a year right out of high school.  You won't be a vice president with a car phone until you earn both.  Rule four, if you think your teacher is tough, wait until you get a boss. 
[02:11:30]  True.  Very true, yeah.  Most of the bosses out there are whatever, kid.  I don't care if you're an equal in school.  Get back to work or you're fired.  Yeah, there's no going to the office.  No.  To the guidance counselor at work.  No, not everyone's going to get the same salary.  Year five.  Like at school, you all get trophies.  Yeah.  Well, in the real world, you don't get the same salary.  No.  Guess what?  The one that's better or works harder, they get more money.  And a lot of times, the one that fakes it better makes more money. 
[02:12:00]  Which is even more infuriating, but that's life.  Sure.  Because it doesn't do work.  Rule five, flipping burgers is not beneath your dignity.  Your grandparents had a different word for burger flipping.  They called it opportunity.  By the way, I officially hate Charles Sykes.  That one's bad, right?  What a douche.  He's trying to be kind of funny.  No, with that one, he's trying to be like, you know, that was an opportunity.  And you kids, Charles Sykes.  Why, you kids? 
[02:12:30]  He's shaking his fist the whole time he's reading this.  I think number 11, he's trying to be kind of funny.  Rule six, if you mess up, it's not your parents' fault.  So don't whine about your mistakes.  Learn from them.  Rule seven, before you were born, your parents weren't as boring as they are now.  They got that way from paying your bills, cleaning your clothes, and listening to you talk about  how cool you are.  So before you save the rainforest from the parasites of your parents' generation, man,  try delousing the closet in your own room.  Rule eight, your school may have done away with winners and losers, but life has not. 
[02:13:00]  This is the one we really talked about today.  In some schools, they have abolished failing grades, and they'll give you as many times as  you want to get the right answers.  This doesn't bear the slightest resemblance to anything in real life.  Rule nine, life is not divided into semesters.  You don't get summers off, and very few employers are interested in helping you find yourself.  Do that on your own time.  Rule ten, television, TV is not real life.  In real life, people actually have to leave the coffee shop and go to jobs. 
[02:13:30]  Ooh, a little stab at friends.  Yeah.  And then rule eleven, be nice to nerds.  Chances are you'll end up working for one.  That old gag.  Where they'll shoot you.  Boy, nerds really go one of two ways, don't they?  They either run Microsoft or they pump 30 bullets into you in the cafeteria.  No gray area there.  No.  Don't nerds ever just have, like, you know, kind of be dicky and then get over it?  No.  Wow.  Steven S. from Bayshore. 
[02:14:00]  Nice.  I like this.  Hey, hope there's a bit of a fan gathering at FH Riley's this coming Saturday.  Let's make Brett some cash.  Yeah, you know, it's summertime.  The restaurant business in general is slow on Long Island.  My bro's restaurant, sure, 400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington Village, FH Riley's.  And I guess some fans will be there on Saturday.  All right, we're off to XM, and you guys are going to do what you do.  I don't know.  Thanks for listening, though. 
[02:14:30]  Yes.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Here we are, XM Satellite Radio.  Ooh, we could do bombs and flubs today.  Right on.  We have a new bombs and flub?  We haven't done that in a long-ass time.  I forgot that we had this just sitting around. 
[02:15:00]  Wait, we've got to call our agent, though.  What?  How many days left in our...  Immediately?  Hello?  Immediately.  Hello?  Hello.  Hey, Bob.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony, how are you, gentlemen?  Hi, Bob.  Were you sleeping?  Yes.  Remember us?  Sorry.  Oh, what time is it in Cali?  Let's see.  9, 8, 7, 6...  It's pretty early in the morning.  Bob?  He's in a sheep.  He counts fire clients.  We have 56 days left on our contracts, and we want to know what is the update. 
[02:15:30]  The update is, I have a conference call with Scott Greenstein today.  Oh, he picked a perfect day to call you and wake you up.  Nice.  Now he's going to be too tired for his conference call.  Yeah, he's going to screw it all up because we woke him up.  I'm going to sleep through it.  What time is the conference call?  Scott would anyway.  11 o'clock my time.  11 o'clock your time, 2 o'clock our time, so you'll have an update by 3 o'clock our time?  Sure.  Are they a little panicky at this point? 
[02:16:00]  We only have 56 days left.  I don't know.  I'll find out and let you know.  Yeah?  How did this come about?  Scott called.  And said, all right, it's time to talk.  Wow.  What do you think?  Well, what do I think?  I think they love you guys.  What do I think?  Oh, nice.  That's nice.  What do you think of Fareed?  What do I think of Fareed?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Be blunt.  Do you hate him as much as we do at this point? 
[02:16:30]  No, of course I don't.  Of course.  Because you have other clients with his stations.  Ah.  Yeah.  What are you in charge of?  Gray and Cluck?  Are they your boys?  Don't know them.  Okay.  I thought he was going to say, I don't know.  Which would be awesome to hear.  Why did Fareed decide to just dump us from unceremoniously?  Every single station.  From every single shit adult station, now that I'm here on XM.  And without even like, now I understand radio. 
[02:17:00]  They don't usually tell you and stuff.  But a guy like Fareed, you'd think he would have, you know, called us up, had us in, just  said, guys, it's like this.  But just to then dump us and make us look bad.  Yeah.  You know they dumped us in Albuquerque for Spanish sports talk.  Well, that's a change of format.  That's a change of lifestyle.  They're basically not acknowledging people that speak English anymore.  How bad were we doing in Albuquerque where they're like, ah, let's see if we can get 
[02:17:30]  the Spanish people listening.  I don't remember what the ratings were there, but they probably weren't very good.  But why are we getting taken off all of the Citadel stations?  And why do these executives still, why do they still have jobs at Citadel Broadcasting  if the stock is like at a dollar and they can't get anything accomplished?  Well, I don't know the answer to that, but I think, um...  Oh, you know the answer.  You just don't want to do it in front of a million people.  Well, Bob, it's like... 
[02:18:00]  No, I don't.  I think that, I think they chose to go local, live and local.  Well, Bob, it's like you've said many times about them over there, that talking to them  is like talking to a bus full of retards.  Yeah.  I never said that.  You've made that point.  It's a valid point.  Bob, you might be confused because you're a little sleepy.  I do remember you saying that.  Yeah.  I'm with Jimmy on that one.  And I said a bus full of retards, like I was kind of bothered by that, and you actually  said it louder.  Yeah, a bus full of retards.  You know, the ones that wear hockey helmets.  Jimmy, never said that.  Nice try. 
[02:18:30]  What do you think of Judy Ellis at this point?  I don't like Judy.  I think Judy's trying to do her job.  How could you like her after what she did to Anthony and I?  Yeah.  Well, some of these places, you really didn't have ratings.  Yeah, but didn't you think, too, that, Bob, part of it is that they weren't doing any  type of promotion, probably, because that's expensive.  Like, they weren't doing anything to help the show along.  Some of the stations were trying to, are particularly great.  And, Bob, the ratings thing is stupid because they're replacing us with awful shows that 
[02:19:00]  aren't going to get ratings.  So it's obviously a bigger issue, because they weren't paying us a lot of money to be  in a lot of these cities.  You know that.  Right.  I mean, when you're replaced by Shut Up and Rock, how is that going to get the ratings  up?  When you're replaced by a program director that now has to do a morning show with some  hack, how is that going to get the ratings up?  You know that they replaced us in Buffalo with the PD, who I'm friendly with?  And he told me in an email that he hasn't done an air shift since college radio? 
[02:19:30]  So, obviously, they're not worried about getting ratings up.  Do you know, and also in, was it Rhode Island, where we were on, they've actually replaced  this with a show called Shit in My Mouth?  That's a shit joke, Bob.  I know.  I recommend that one.  Shit in my mouth in the mornings.  No one's going to tune into that.  Well, I think that was a very weak station.  Anyhow, I think some of this has to do with...  Well, Buffalo wasn't a weak station, and we were doing okay. 
[02:20:00]  You know that.  I don't know what happened there.  I really don't know what happened.  And I think some of it is also, you know, money is very tight now, and if they could  save, you know, the dollars.  But how does that help in the long run, if you're saving dollars, but then you don't  get ratings by saving dollars, so now you're going to lose more money because the advertisers  aren't going to come on board because the ratings still suck?  That's a call they have to make on their own.  You know, they run their stations.  I noticed they're not saving money by maybe taking a cut in pay. 
[02:20:30]  They're still making a ridiculous fortune.  How about they cut their own salaries and keep us on in a few of these markets?  That's right, Bob.  Like you've always said, they think first of aligning their pocketbooks.  Oh, sure.  I've said that.  Many times.  That's right.  Yeah, not in those nice terms either.  Right.  Yeah, Jimmy cleaned it up a little bit.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Thanks for saving me, Jimmy.  That's all right.  So what's your take on this whole thing, Bob?  Go.  Comment, Bob.  Go.  Bob, what do you think? 
[02:21:00]  Because the whole ratings thing, they didn't take us off for lack of ratings because they  obviously don't care about ratings.  Yeah.  Because we said if they would have replaced us with Hannity or another show that's very  successful, then we would understand.  Yeah.  You know, Bob of the love douche.  Yeah.  I think there's a trend in several of these companies, CBS included, to be local.  To be local, live and local.  Right.  Can you at least admit that their decision-making was kind of shitty on this one? 
[02:21:30]  I don't understand the Buffalo situation at all.  Shitty?  Yeah.  I just don't get that one because I thought you were doing very well.  Yeah.  We were doing very well.  Yeah.  It's a matter of, and that just proves the fact that they were yanking us off all their  stations and putting PDs in there.  Yeah.  Saved some money.  I think it's saving money.  Exactly.  Yeah.  So can't we get another station in Buffalo?  We can look.  We just signed on in Norfolk. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  That's exciting.  Yeah.  Because L.A. sucks.  I mean, Norfolk's obviously not a bad station.  Well, yeah.  Norfolk is the hotbed of radio excitement.  I'm just saying.  A lot of celebrities live in Norfolk.  Absolutely.  I think a station in Buffalo would be happy to have a show that was doing well.  Yeah.  Last I looked, we were number one in the younger male demos.  Their excuse was they wanted us number one in the upper male demos.  But that was all a lie, obviously. 
[02:22:30]  You can't like Judy that much at this point.  You know that.  You don't.  I know.  I think that's a 25-54 station.  I think that's really what they're looking for in that station.  Dude, they play Godsmack.  It's not a 25-54-year-old station.  If that's the case, then they should go classic rock.  They're playing young male music.  Comment, Bob?  No, I thought that was an older station.  Well, you thought wrong.  That's right.  Basically, they've been proven as liars.  Your comments on that? 
[02:23:00]  No, I think the afternoon show is a 25-54 station.  I mean, it's a 24-54 show.  True.  I think their ratings have always been...  No, not always.  They grew with their listeners.  Shred's been in that market forever.  Is it a coincidence, too, that all the shows were yanked very close at the same time?  You don't think it has anything to do with the fact that maybe the merger went through  and they're scared of dealing with males, so they want to do it in the summer when less  people are listening?  I think one of the concerns is that they're not sure that you're going to be on past a certain 
[02:23:30]  point when your deal is up or when their contracts are over, sure, no one knows the answer to  that, whether you're going to be exclusive to XM Sirius or not.  Sirius XM, Bob, please.  Sirius XM.  You're embarrassing us.  Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Right.  We take pride in the new company, and here you are, just tossing the name around like  a shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I think that's really part of it. 
[02:24:00]  How about you mention Jim Norton today as well?  Ha, ha, ha.  No, seriously, I think that's part of it.  I think CBS is concerned about that as well.  His worst improv skills thing fucking steeds us.  Doing wonderfully.  Yes.  Yeah.  Did Fareed call you to tell you what's going on?  No, Fareed didn't.  Does Fareed?  But Judy's called.  Oh, did she?  What did she say?  What did she say?  What did she say about what?  I mean, we were talking.  About the situation in the Middle East.  How does she feel? 
[02:24:30]  Does she feel that Israel's the problem, or does she feel that the Palestinians won't  negotiate?  About the fact that we're getting knocked off of all their stations.  There's something else going on here, Bob.  Yeah.  A few of those cities that we obviously should have stayed on.  But they're getting out of the Opie and Anthony business.  Right.  Well, definitely.  The contracts were up, actually.  The only contract that was beyond July was Syracuse.  Yeah, they have to pay us for that, right?  Why do they lie, by the way, about putting us back on Buffalo? 
[02:25:00]  Why do they lie?  I don't know.  I thought that we had an agreement that you would stay on Buffalo instead of Syracuse until  January.  And then figure it out, right?  So...  What did she say about it?  What did Judy say?  Like, what did she say?  Did she say, look, this is why we're doing this?  I think I'm figuring out the problem.  She said the ratings weren't good.  Everywhere, it's just not realistic. 
[02:25:30]  And they didn't promote the show.  They didn't do anything for the show.  Yeah.  Plus, we were on a bunch of bad signals that don't have ratings across the board.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  I think some of the stations did have...  You know, they were weak signals.  There were several of them.  Mm-hmm.  So...  Why are we such a sensation in New York?  And the talk of town in Boston.  You answer me that, Bob.  Your turn.  Go.  I don't know the answer why it didn't work in some of these other markets.  I think promotion is part of it.  I think going to the market, being local is part of it. 
[02:26:00]  I don't agree with that local thing.  Yeah.  No one...  Who cares about fucking traffic and weather?  If you're driving to work and you see a bunch of red lights, you're in traffic.  Right.  It's fucking raining.  Bring an umbrella.  A lot of radio executives, they feel better if you, like, visit their dumb little town or city.  But we've proven that's not necessarily needed.  We've failed in many places.  We've stopped in.  Exactly.  And why are we on in Philly?  What's going on with Chris Oliveira?  I think he's waiting.  First of all, they had to hire a program director. 
[02:26:30]  Uh-huh.  And I think they're waiting to see what...  Whether we are going to be...  But don't they understand they have to strengthen their position before this whole thing gets crazy?  Yeah.  They don't want to put you on for seven or eight months and have you be inked from terrestrial radio.  What else are they doing?  That's stupid.  Yeah.  If they had a secondary plan, then I would understand.  But we're better than just music.  Yeah, I agree.  They should put you on until it's a term, even for seven or eight months. 
[02:27:00]  Is it that stupid new show, Cunt Hat in the Morning?  They're taking the world by storm.  It's a guy who wears a hat with a cunt painted on it.  He calls himself Cunt Hat in the Morning and he's a big hit everywhere.  But he spells it with a case.  They'll put it on the bumper stickers.  There's food, all right.  Booyah.  Booyah.  Oh, God.  Bob, do you booyah?  I think that that station is...  We're talking about when you want to.  What does it matter?  What do you think, Bob?  The station's playing music in the morning. 
[02:27:30]  That's good.  That's very observant on your part.  And they plan on doing that until they know by October what you guys are going to do.  But then once they know, what are they going to do then?  Your turn.  Yeah.  I think if we're able to be exclusive or non-exclusive, I think we'll have an extended agreement.  I think they'll put you on in Philly.  So they would leave us off for eight months?  Spoken like a true politician.  They would just play shitty music for eight months instead of putting on this fucking  taking the world by storm radio program?  No, it's not eight months. 
[02:28:00]  But when we have an agreement with Sirius XM.  Okay.  They'll know what we're going to do.  And that agreement will happen shortly.  Bob, what do you think we should be doing?  Yes.  Good question.  Not on the show because, you know, no one's going to listen to that.  Exactly.  You have no clue.  Exactly.  You haven't laughed for once.  There's been some gems here.  Yeah, Bob, we're throwing your fucking gold here and you're just kind of looking at it  like this pony shit.  Yeah.  You're looking through the shit and you're finding the shit.  You're failing to see the gold bars.  Pony shit. 
[02:28:30]  Look, either way, you have a home.  I mean, you have CBS wants you, XM wants you, Sirius XM wants you.  So what should you do?  Citadel doesn't want us, Bob.  That's where we want to be.  No, we don't.  We want to move out of New York and syndicate from Rhode Island.  That's what we want to do.  Bob, should we go exclusive with Satellite Radio?  Go.  Yes.  Do I think you should go?  No, I like that you have two homes. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, you do like that.  We're working our balls off.  That's wonderful.  How about this?  How about if Sirius XM says, look, we don't want you to be exclusive.  We want you to be exclusive.  But you can do extended phone-ins.  Is there any station that would syndicate us if we just did phoners after the show?  See, Jimmy's got a lot of good ideas here.  And you're not really.  Jimmy's a great one.  Emmett in Jersey.  He works at the Bronx Zoo.  He says, my chimp answers more questions than Bob.  Yeah, Bob, I hear a lot of lackadaisical answers on this end here. 
[02:29:30]  I'd like some hardcore answers.  Some solid...  Just trying to play it safe, guys.  I know.  How about some solid leads here?  No, I don't think they're solid leads.  I think we'll know more over the next few weeks.  He's playing it close to the vest.  Mm-hmm.  Bob, are you amazed that Robin hasn't left you yet?  Go.  No, not really.  I think she's made some wise decisions.  Is your homosexuality affecting the negotiations? 
[02:30:00]  No, I think that's a positive aspect.  Yeah.  I don't know what's...  All right, well, I guess you have to...  I guess you can't blow it all out.  I mean, you know.  No, I can't.  You guys do.  I can't.  That's smart.  All right, so you just love everybody.  No, I don't love everybody.  I just don't talk about it as widely as you guys do.  You do know that Citadel is completely lost, and you should acknowledge that on our show.  No, I think their stock is hammered, but I think... 
[02:30:30]  They're lost, and they should be firing some big-time executives instead of, you know,  cutting costs on the local level, like putting PDs in mornings.  Why don't they cut some of these big salaries the executives make?  They're not going to suffer, right?  It's like you said at dinner, Bob.  They're living high on the hog while they deep-dick the little guy.  That's right.  I was surprised to hear you use that language, but you said deep-dicked so harshly, you actually  had spittle fly out of my turkey sandwich.  That sounds...  That sounds...  I remember when I said that.  He pointed at me.  He's like... 
[02:31:00]  And they're deep-dicking the little guy, and the spit flew out all over my sandwich.  It was an ugly sign of Bob.  We were impressed.  Yeah.  All right, guys.  Well, thanks for calling.  Hi, there it is.  All right.  Well, at least we got some answers.  At first, we were blaming it on his alcoholism, but then realized that, no, this is just part  of his personality, right, Jimmy?  Yeah, we thought it was the alcoholism, but apparently not.  It's just that you're, you know, kind of after a hard night of being a bottom.  It's very early where he is. 
[02:31:30]  Yes.  It's very early.  I'll talk to you again after I talk to Scott.  So, yeah, let him talk to Scott.  Bob's nickname in the underground gay community is the agent.  Bob's a big bottom in the underground gay community, and they're like, hey, take your  fucking Cialis, the agent's stopping by.  Just lets all the radio executives have a turn.  Nothing wrong with that.  Bob's a fucking leather queen.  All right, Bob.  Well, God bless you.  All right, guys.  We got no answers to our questions.  Although, the conference call thing, that's promising. 
[02:32:00]  But, Bob, let me ask you honestly, do you think, though, that if one company decides  that they want to have exclusivity, is there a way with exclusivity to work it where, like,  everybody has kind of kept feeling a certain way?  That everyone's feeling a certain way?  Well, I mean, like, if, say, SiriusXM says, look, we're going to thrive on content that  is exclusive, but Terrestrial says, yeah, but with the advertising revenue, it's going  to be a whole different ballgame.  Is there any way to make it where that doesn't affect the whole thing?  Sure. 
[02:32:30]  So, I think we have an option to do what we want to do.  We want to be exclusive.  We want to accept a deal like that.  We do.  If we don't, we, you know, as Mel said, you know, you can do what Bubba did.  What, suck?  Eat everything in sight?  Exactly.  Talk in phony voices and stand.  Ah, yeah, by the way.  That boy.  I think that Mel and of you went very well.  We had a very nice time with Mel. 
[02:33:00]  No, I thought it was great.  I thought you guys did a great job.  Yeah, he's very personable, and he's a very engaging guy.  He certainly doesn't beat around the bush when you ask him something.  He answered everything.  Yeah.  I thought the answer about when he fired you guys was very, very funny, very interesting.  Yes.  Very candid.  And then he criticized accurately.  He's like, well, that shouldn't have been in the deal.  So, Mel basically said that Bob probably should have done something a little different.  Bob, comment?  Yes, there's a comment.  That's in every single deal he ever had.  Okay.  It's called the pay or play. 
[02:33:30]  Every TV deal.  That's why you see television series when the episodes are produced.  They produce two episodes.  The actor has 13 in his contract.  They pay them out for the rest of them.  They don't produce the others.  Let's hope we have this type of tough talk on the phone today with Scott Greenstein.  Fucking Bob taking it to everybody.  It's just unbelievable.  It's everyone's deal.  I'll play and let you know.  All right.  I'm getting congested, Bob.  Okay.  I am.  I have sinus problems.  And can you guys hear it as we're talking?  My antihistamine's wearing off.  Yeah. 
[02:34:00]  I'm not doing anything.  You're starting to sound like this.  Yeah.  My antihistamine's wearing off.  It's so bad.  I'm so addicted to it now.  Your antihistamine.  Ooh.  All right.  Can I go now?  Wow.  Yeah.  Godspeed.  Get some rest.  You got a big phone call today.  Yes.  Big phone call for you, Bob.  All right.  I'll let you know.  A lot of people don't know this.  When Bob negotiates in conference calls, he's cruising the internet and jerking off.  All right.  Hyman Ross. 
[02:34:30]  I hope there's more to do on that telephone call.  Jesus.  I know.  You just sound.  Well, now we have an agent.  Pass the phone around.  Pass the antihistamine around.  PC in Virginia says Bob's briefcase contains a bowl.  Yeah, I got a popper and stuff.  It's a bunch of fucking, a bunch of glass cocks.  All right, guys.  I hope you have something more.  I thought he could help.  I hope Bob is still there.  All right, buddy.  Bye-bye.  Bye, sweetie.  All right.  There you go.  It's Bob.  Oh, boy.  Negotiating our future in a few hours.  That's wonderful.  Yeah.  We woke him up. 
[02:35:00]  We woke him up.  That's great.  He'll be all cranky.  He won't know what they're saying.  That's good, though.  He'll want a cranky agent on.  He'll forget a decimal point in a wrong place.  All righty.  Let's say hi to Harry.  I'm going to say it every time a Harry calls now.  Wow.  I double dare you.  Hey, Harry in Ohio.  What's up, Harry?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Oh, hey, Jimmy Norman.  Hey, man.  Hello, Harry. 
[02:35:30]  Holy shit.  Hold on.  Hold the fucking phone.  You're holding the phone.  Oh.  Mel Karmazin made $400,000 in the first 10 minutes of the stock being open.  Good.  Motherfucker.  Why did we take his lead?  Sell.  Why did we take his lead?  Sell, Mortimer.  We're dummies.  Fucking, we're just stupid.  Mel Karmazin.  It's just on paper.  Mel Karmazin bought 2 million shares?  Yes.  2 million shares of serious stock. 
[02:36:00]  And in the first 10 minutes of the market being open, he made $400,000.  Yes.  Yes, Danny?  It spiked 10 cents at the open.  You're on a 20-minute delay.  You don't get live quotes.  Well, the latest I have, I have pre-market real time.  It's up 10 cents.  So unless it jumped another 10.  Well, yeah, you're probably on a 20-minute delay.  You don't have real-time quotes there, do you?  I'm sitting there going, he must know something.  Why don't I do the same thing Mel Karmazin's doing? 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, you'd think that would be a smart move.  I know.  If we bought it, it would have gone down.  But then again, Fareed did the same thing recently, and he lost $3.5 million.  You never know.  You never know.  You know what?  It's when you're buying 2 million shares, if it goes up 10 cents, I mean, how much?  Yeah, 2 million, how much is your share?  Right.  Mel's got like $4 million.  Yeah, see?  We'd have to like...  It sucks.  I know it does.  I can't wait until they operate Friday.  Sorry.  That's all right.  See, we would have to put a lot more into it than just a few dollars. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah, to make the real money, you really got to like gamble.  Yeah, you got to put a lot of money in to get a lot of money out.  If we just like would have put like bought, let's say, 1,000 shares, that's not that much money.  You're only making a couple hundred dollars off.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not even worth the commission.  If you're buying 2 million shares, that's a bit of a gamble because that costs them over $2 million.  I don't think Jimmy appreciates being made fun of like this.  That's the...  That's his medical problem.  The profit of $400. 
[02:37:30]  Go on.  Go on.  That hurts.  How many are you talking?  That hurts to do that.  What do you got, Harry?  What's up, Harry?  Hey, I came home late last night, and when I was coming down the hill down to my house,  I noticed my shed door was up.  Yes.  And I could see a slight shadow in my shed, so I pulled around the block, and I carry a  baseball bat in my pickup truck. 
[02:38:00]  And...  What, did you have a game with the guy?  I snuck around...  Do I?  Nothing.  Continue.  I snuck around the back of the house and came through and surprised what I thought was  one dark-colored-skinned gentleman, but there was actually two.  And the one reached in his pocket, and I lit him up like I was Babe Ruth.  Swing away.  Swung, I caught him in the middle of his back. 
[02:38:30]  He dropped like a rock.  The other one tried to make a run for it, and I caught him in the knees.  And, yeah, the police show up, and, yeah, I get carted off to jail also for excessive  force.  Excessive force?  Why?  You fucking...  What are you supposed to do?  You didn't know the guy was reaching for a gun?  Well, when I was done, I caved both their skulls in with a rock.  No, you...  That's ridiculous. 
[02:39:00]  What'd you get off on...  That's...  That's what I thought, and the only reason that I'm out of jail today is because my father-in-law  is a good friend of the prosecutor, and he said that there was no call for the excessive  force.  Well, what are you supposed to do?  You see one of them reaching in their pocket.  I didn't know he was pulling out a gun.  Exactly.  So, uh...  He's playing autograph.  He thought you were a ball player.  A pen I meant.  God damn it.  I got it, though.  Sorry, Harry.  No.  Harry. 
[02:39:30]  I hope no more Harrys ever call.  Why?  I hope every person's Harry now.  All right, Harry.  All right, thank you.  Jimmy, I love the book, buddy.  I just bought it and started reading it, and I like it so far.  Oh, thank you so much.  I appreciate it.  Thanks, Harry.  All right, you guys have a good day.  You too, there.  I feel like I'm talking with penises in my nose.  Ooh, you want to?  That's how I describe it to the doctor.  I don't know.  That's the only way I can describe congestion.  Like, I feel like I have penises in my nose, Doc. 
[02:40:00]  You know something?  I think you need something to compare it to.  So, you know, penises in your nose, perhaps.  You should say baby penises.  Really shock them.  I'd probably breathe right through that.  I feel like I have fucking, I feel like I have coming into their own teenage boy penises  that are fattening up in my sinuses.  All right, you want to take a break?  We got bombs and flubs.  We got a pastor that broke into a woman's home to steal a couple items.  The items are pretty funny.  We got booyah to show Jimmy today. 
[02:40:30]  Booyah.  And we got a man calling 9-1-1 over a Subway sangwich.  Trying to breathe.  No blowing snot rockets.  Look at this.  What happened to my other blueberries?  Someone ate my blueberries?  Look at this.  What is that?  What is that?  What the fuck is this? 
[02:41:00]  What is it?  Oh, fuck!  What is that?  I hate snot!  I blew clear snot into my fucking fingers.  Nice.  Let me see that.  Stop it!  Oh my gosh.  How much to put on my tongue?  I'm not looking.  I don't want to listen.  Put it on Pat Duffy's tongue.  No, I can't do that.  Why?  What's wrong with that?  I can't touch his tongue.  Why?  I used to feed boogers to Bob Kelly's dogs.  Five bucks?  It's a salty one.  Yeah.  How much are you giving me not to eat it?  Five bucks?  I won't eat it. 
[02:41:30]  I'm not even going to deal with this.  Snot is, to me, probably the second worst bodily fluid.  Second only to shit.  How about cum?  Jesus, that's third on your list?  No, I mean like out of, you know, my own body.  Can you get a tissue, please?  Like a fucking liquid snot.  Thanks, Steve.  How about a thicker one?  Not a paper.  No one blows their nose when my grandmother was here with paper toweling.  What?  You know, you say cum, but I wouldn't sit there and blow a load of snot on my stomach and go to sleep. 
[02:42:00]  I have.  I used to fall asleep when I pulled up my belly button.  No, I mean mucus.  See, I thought you said cum is worse than snot, and I say no, because...  Ooh, nice.  I think we should go home early today.  I wouldn't let a stranger blow snot in my face.  We're a little distracted because, you know, we got the big conference call today with the boys over at Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  We should probably show them we're working hard then.  It's a bad day to leave early. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, we're a little distracted.  We should go home and get ready for the conference call.  Yeah.  I think we should.  Yeah, I think we should, too.  You, Jimmy?  Very big.  I think that...  Big shoe.  I have dandruff and my nose is stuffy.  Yuck.  I should be decapitated.  Yuck-a-rooney.  All right, we're going to take a quick break.  The 911 call, the pastor stealing stuff from my house, and bombs and flubs all on the way with this booyah of a show. 
[02:43:00]  This never happened.  Yeah, we're at least cracking ourselves up.  Yeah.  We're disgusting.  I went to Jimmy, I go, boy, that Bob is noncommittal, huh?  Doesn't want to trash anybody.  And Jimmy was like, no, you really want an agent like that.  You don't want an agent like us because nothing would ever get done.  Yeah, I mean, he's a real politician.  I'm like, well, he shouldn't.  That's what you want.  You don't want an agent like...  If he thinks like us, he'd get emotional and hang up on Scott today.  Right.  And be a baby.  Or he'd call up and he'd go, that motherfucker. 
[02:43:30]  Like, you never want to hear agents say that.  That motherfucker.  You want a kiss-ass fucking wormy agent.  Bob, what happened?  Well, he pissed me off, so I threw poker chips at him.  Bob just loses his mind.  Next thing you know, he's negotiating a fine podcast for us because he's just ornery.  You never want your agent to call up, but when you go, what happened?  And the first thing he says is, fucking babies.  What fucking babies? 
[02:44:00]  All right.  All right.  Let's do some work.  Finally.  Now that we've fucked around for an hour.  I can't read.  Here's some shit for you fuckers.  Yeah.  Now the shit's coming down.  That's right.  Here you go.  Enjoy this, fuckers.  Suck on this.  Laugh it up, lucky dogs.  You're lucky we're even here still.  Here it comes.  Listen to this shit.  That was so stupid. 
[02:44:30]  It's unbelievable what people get upset about.  Wasting the police time to come for a sandwich.  Who knew a Subway sandwich could cook up so much trouble?  When you ask for the worst...  How's a cook-up trouble, you fuck?  Well...  You make a sandwich, you don't cook a fucking sandwich.  It's cooking.  What?  I know.  They don't know what they're talking about.  Why do you have to put a food thing in there?  Like, why...  Because that's what they do.  How is that good journalism?  It ties it in and you go, oh, look at what he did.  That's clever.  I gotta watch this guy every day. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  That's a fuck.  Help against cancer, hold the lettuce.  That's kind of fun, actually.  Cook-up's so much trouble.  When you ask for the worst, it consists of certain vegetables on your sandwich.  Police say that made...  He only had one Terry Schiavo, he wanted two.  I want two Schiavos and a Quinlan.  What is this?  Maybe they didn't have the vegetables, because I'm going to guess, because of the salmonella  breakout.  Oh.  Sandwich. 
[02:45:30]  Police say that made Reginald Peterson pretty mad.  Mad enough to call 911 twice to complain about his spicy Italian sub.  Well, evidently, he tasted the sandwich, and it didn't have mayonnaise or mustard on it.  So, he became upset.  Ollington 911, what is your emergency?  This is Tuesday or Wednesday.  911 operators across the country field calls every day from people with their own so-called  emergencies.  I'd also like to be connected to Donovan's Pizza Place in Ollington.  That's not enough.  This is 911. 
[02:46:00]  911 is for police and fire emergencies.  Well, I can get through on Pizza Hut line or...  Okay, well, yeah, well, ma'am, 911 does not connect you to Domino's Pizza.  As for Peterson, the subway caller, he got arrested and told officers to throw a sandwich  away.  You know...  Evidence in a box somewhere.  E-Rock, you're going to give me my 911 calls, right?  Oh, now you're going to.  Uh-oh.  They're what?  No, I have a bunch of 911 calls here already. 
[02:46:30]  Do you really?  Yeah.  Travis, does he?  Travis is shaking as fuck.  Now he does.  Oh, boy.  What do you mean?  Will you get that fucking snot out of your nose?  Poor Jimmy.  Not in my nose.  It's in my soul.  Yeah, that's deep.  You can hear it.  It's just this...  Oh.  I blow so hard, the fucking...  My shoulder skin crinkles.  I'm full of snot.  It's pumping through my fucking veins.  I can't even... 
[02:47:00]  That's the cholesterol.  It's actually snot in your veins.  It's just snot in my heart, my lungs.  I came and it was a fucking snot bubble.  Salty snot booger.  You make a lot of snot.  Is that the problem?  Or are your little sinus holes too small?  Can we make snot tea from your tissues and make...  Oh, fuck.  And make pet stuffy drink it?  I'll do it tomorrow.  I'll try to save it more.  Snot tea.  Let's make some snot tea.  Oh, that is so disgusting.  How would you do that?  You'd have to get a tea bag. 
[02:47:30]  And take the tea out, obviously.  And then put the snotty tissues in.  Really snotty ones.  Yeah.  And then staple it shut again.  Yeah.  And then, like, steep it.  Can we make some snot tea?  Snot tea.  Get some hot water.  Oh, that's so fucking disgusting.  You should have told me earlier,  so I would have saved more.  Just start dipping the tissues  into the hot water we bring to you.  Snot tea.  We're going to have a nice warm cup of snot tea.  No, you've got to do it with a real fucking hanky. 
[02:48:00]  Because that way the fucking tissue won't shred.  It will be all the snot.  And the boogers will dissolve?  Yeah, but this way you can take a spoon  and scrape the boogers off a hanky.  I can't even talk about this.  You can take the spoon  and scrape the boogers off a hanky.  Dude, if you make snot tea,  I'll make underpants tea.  Oh, God.  Stop it.  What kind of tea do you want to make, Ant?  I don't want to make any tea like that.  I'm claiming underpants tea.  Jimmy's got snot tea.  Which one do you want to make?  What do you mean underpants, front or back?  Well, after I work out,  I mean, it's quite...  Sometimes it's impressive.  So you're going with, like, the back? 
[02:48:30]  You know, I ride a...  Sort of a chocolate milk instead of a lemonade?  My new thing is I ride my bike a lot.  Yeah?  So, you know, you get bike ass in your underpants.  Let me think.  What kind of tea?  How about...  I was thinking maybe tongue-scraping tea?  Oh.  That's worse.  That would be really bad.  Tongue-scraping tea.  But the hot water may kill a lot of it.  Earwax tea.  That's easy.  No, it's not easy.  That's not easy.  I laugh at earwax. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, stop it.  You get a bunch of peanut butter out of your ear,  and it would dissolve real good,  like fucking wax tends to, and...  Dude, give me a cracker.  What?  Let's make an earwax cracker.  No, you're not.  Oh, yeah, cracker's better.  Yeah, let's get a cracker.  You got a cracker back there?  You're not going to eat an earwax cracker.  All right, we got the hot water.  Start dipping your snot.  How many boogers have?  No, you got to get a hanky.  I'm telling you, hanky's better.  A hanky.  A hanky.  Who uses a hanky?  I want a monogrammed hanky immediately. 
[02:49:30]  We got a guy who has a snot tea recipe.  Matt in Boston, yes.  That's the four.  Guys, I have the recipe for the snot tea.  Okay.  You need the coffee press, that French coffee press.  You put all the tissues in the bottom,  you just add hot water,  and then you push the plunger down.  Oh, God.  Oh, and it would press it all out.  I like that.  God, what that would look like.  I like it.  Greenish fucking water comes out.  I should get one of the ones where you scrape it, 
[02:50:00]  and it's half a scab.  Yeah.  It's like a bloody booger.  You ever scrape a blood booger?  All right.  Okay, I can't fucking even.  Did you ever?  I pulled boogers out of my nose.  You got to get Voss for snot tea.  Voss gets bigger snots than anybody.  Literally, you could fucking repel from them.  Oh, God.  Why don't we just blow snot rockets  until we collect enough?  Voss has the greatest.  We got to do fucking snot tea with Voss.  All right, we're doing snot tea with Voss.  Because his boogers,  he used to fucking pick them out 
[02:50:30]  and then hang them on his cigarette butts.  Yeah, I remember that.  Hey, you want to hear some of these 911 calls?  Of course.  Which ones you got, E-Rock?  I have a lady saying  she's going to hit a motherfucker with a hammer.  Connecting to Domino's,  asking what time it is,  calling Burger King,  a possible murder.  Dispatcher doesn't believe little boy  when he calls in.  Calling Taco Bell.  All right, you really are stupid.  You know that, right? 
[02:51:00]  Why would we want, like,  kind of real 911 calls?  We want the food ones,  because this is what this one's about.  So why are you naming off the ones  that have nothing to do with calling about food?  Well, I said Domino's and Taco Bell.  Yeah, and then you said the other ones.  Why would we pick from those?  I don't know, because they were funny.  Yeah, why would you give us options?  Well, how about,  what's the Domino's one about?  No, what's it about not playing? 
[02:51:30]  I'm not remembering off the top of my head here.  There's a lady calling the cops  because Taco Bell got her food wrong.  No, Taco Bell.  What is Travis saying?  Arguing in there.  He keeps saying Domino's.  You want to hear this?  Sure.  911, what's your emergency?  I need assistance at Jim's,  Lincoln's, and Woodbury's.  I know, what's the problem?  They kill my damn dollar.  He won't fix my taco.  I'm half over I see me.  He's holding my dollar and 10 cents. 
[02:52:00]  Hold on, hold on.  Slow down.  What's going on?  Hello?  What did I say?  I can't tell.  You're yelling at me.  I need assistance.  I want my dollar or my taco.  You're having a problem with the taco?  The owner, the proprietor here.  You're having a problem with the taco?  I am.  The owner, bitch.  Pardon me.  Excuse me?  I am upset.  I know.  You have to calm down  and kind of tell me what's going on here now.  If you're allergic to any goddamn thing I'm saying.  Are you drunk?  No, I am not a drunk.  Okay, then why don't you just start talking a little bit?  You want me to stop?  You can get some motherfucking ass over here. 
[02:52:30]  Slow down.  What?  I need some information from you,  so slow down.  You bring your ass  and get my motherfucking taco out of here.  My ass is in the office here,  so you need to...  You want to do assistance to me?  You need to calm down and tell me something here.  Okay?  All right, bitch.  What was wrong with the taco?  The motherfucking refused to sell it to me.  He refused to sell you a taco?  He won't get any of my money back.  He took your money,  but he won't give you a taco.  Yeah, my goddamn house is locked up,  you motherfucking youth.  I got $1.75.  Me?  Why are you calling me names?  Look, are you coming in now? 
[02:53:00]  As far as I'm concerned,  you can have that taco.  I want my goddamn job.  What?  I said,  as far as I'm concerned,  you can have the taco.  Tell that bitch over here.  How am I going to get this?  I'm going to give my money.  Okay.  What's your name?  Antoinette.  Antoinette.  Yeah.  Okay, what's your last name, Antoinette?  Jones.  Antoinette Jones.  Antoinette Jones.  I want my dollar and my taco.  He took your money,  but he wouldn't give you your food.  That's correct.  That's not right.  What's your day at work?  I don't have to give you all that  to come get my dollar.  I'm upset. 
[02:53:30]  You don't have to do anything  if you don't want it.  Well, then goddamn it,  it'll fix me.  Calm down.  I'm trying to get an info from you.  You're eating, aren't you?  I'm not going to lie to see me.  This motherfucker's insulting me,  and you are too.  Antoinette?  Yes.  Are you going to give me the information,  or do you just want to go with me?  You better come here  and get my dollar out this next.  Or else what?  Look,  do you refuse to help me?  No, I'm trying to get some information.  What the fuck do you want?  Where are you at right now?  What did I say?  Where did I say I was?  I know, but are you going to stay there,  or are you going to go to your house? 
[02:54:00]  And don't come here with no nigger.  What?  Don't bring no nigger here.  Who's a nigger?  Look,  are you coming?  Are you calling me an nigger?  And then I said don't bring no nigger here.  What does that have to do with this?  You come here.  Do you want,  are you saying you want a white deputy,  or what?  How long?  Are you saying you want a white deputy?  Exactly.  You don't want any African-American deputies?  No, I don't.  Why's that?  Look.  And there she goes.  Wow.  I forgot about that one.  I forgot that thrilling ending.  Yeah. 
[02:54:30]  Where she doesn't want the African-American deputy.  Gentleman to assist her.  For some reason.  And I'm sure some dude died of a heart attack  because he was trying to get through.  Yeah.  But she needed her taco taken care of.  You know why she didn't want one of the brothers  going down there?  Why?  Because he'd have fucking told her,  bitch,  shut the fuck up.  And she knows it.  She knows she could probably get one over  on a white deputy.  But if a black guy went down there  and saw a sister fucking mouthing off like that?  You think that was a sister?  He'd clock her in the fucking face. 
[02:55:00]  Antoinette Jones?  Oh, I don't think a white deputy  would be very helpful either.  No, no.  I don't think so.  But a brother would fucking  just nip that right in the bud.  He wouldn't even try any fucking diplomacy  with that piece of shit.  PC saying,  all right,  that's got to be fake.  It's not fake.  I remember when that came in.  It was a big story and all that crap.  It's fake.  Yeah.  That's how you know it's real.  What other ones we got there,  E-Rock?  Burger King,  Domino's?  Not what you're eating.  What do we have? 
[02:55:30]  All right,  let's try Burger King.  E-Rock.  Jack,  how can I help you?  Yeah,  I'm over here at Burger King  right here in San Clemente.  No,  not San Clemente.  I'm sorry.  I live in San Clemente.  I'm in Laguna Niguel,  I think.  That's where I'm at.  I'm at a drive-thru right now.  I ordered my food three times.  They're mopping the floor inside  and I understand they're busy.  They're not even busy.  Okay,  I've been to only car here.  I asked for four different times  to make me a Western barbecue burger. 
[02:56:00]  Okay,  they keep giving me a hamburger  with lettuce,  tomato,  and cheese,  onions,  and I said,  I'm not leaving.  I want a Western burger  because I just got my kids  from Taekwondo.  They're hungry.  I'm on my way home  and I live in San Clemente.  Okay,  she gave me another hamburger.  It's wrong.  I said,  four times.  I said,  I want it.  She goes,  can you go out and park in front?  I said,  no.  She's waiting for someone to say  and then someone fell  and cracked their head open  and they're bleeding profusely.  Like,  she's just going,  uh-huh,  uh-huh,  waiting for the emergency part  and then the guy 
[02:56:30]  pulled out a knife  and stabbed somebody.  She's like,  this cannot be the call.  They're waiting for  and he's still inside.  Right,  right.  Yeah,  yeah,  something.  Something.  He already beheaded,  uh,  one customer.  He held the head up  in the window  and he's eating him.  He's sawing through the second head  as I speak.  Sure.  Because she cannot possibly believe  that this fucking dumb cunt  is calling  because her burger order is wrong.  Sure. 
[02:57:00]  All right,  let's continue there,  you rock.  She gave me another hamburger.  It's wrong.  I said,  four times.  I said,  I want it.  She goes,  can you go out and park in front?  I said,  no.  I want my hamburger right.  So then the lady came to the manager,  or whoever she is,  she came up and she said,  um,  she said,  um,  do you want your money back?  And I said,  no,  I want my hamburger.  My kids are hungry  and I have to jump on the toll freeway.  I said,  I am not leaving the spot.  And I said,  I will call the police  because I want my Western burger done right.  Now,  is that so hard?  Oh my God.  Okay.  What exactly is it you want us to do for you? 
[02:57:30]  I send the officer down here.  I want,  I want them to make me right.  Ma'am,  we're not going to go down there  and enforce your Western bacon cheeseburger.  Enforce,  enforce your Western bacon cheeseburger.  How much do you hate that woman?  I,  I,  with every muscle in my body.  Her job is to send an officer  and she's refusing.  Oh,  see,  I thought,  Oh,  Jimmy,  did you just flip that?  I did.  I want that lady to have her Western burger. 
[02:58:00]  I,  hopefully it's made it,  if it's made of AIDS and crushed glass,  get it for her immediately.  Oh,  I live in San Clemente.  I'm in Laguna Niguel.  I had to pick my kids up from Taekwondo.  Taekwondo.  She's just an entitled twat.  A whinging cunt.  We got a drunk rambling about Bush.  Hold on a minute.  We'll get back to that call in a second.  Nick in Missouri.  Yep.  Hi,  Nick.  How are you?  What?  Hi,  Nick.  How are you?  What's up in Missouri? 
[02:58:30]  It's hot as hell.  Heck,  what's wrong with Bush,  man?  What's up?  You know,  he's just,  he's just one crazy son of a bitch.  He just needs to be out of office.  Until Obama gets in,  prices will go down on gas,  prices will go down on groceries,  prices will go down in restaurants.  How's that?  All that kind of stuff.  How's that going to happen?  Yeah.  Well,  because Obama has actual plans to cut taxes. 
[02:59:00]  He's going to,  you know,  Cut taxes?  Really?  That's that,  sir,  that hasn't been his platform.  Yeah.  It's been to raise taxes.  Yeah.  Well,  see,  I think,  I seriously think that,  like,  he's going to end up,  you know,  he's going to bring,  he's going to bring things to the American people that everybody wants.  Like what?  Lower taxes.  No,  see,  he's going to raise taxes.  I don't think he will.  No,  no,  he will raise taxes. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah,  that's pretty much a guarantee.  It's a no,  it's pretty much a given that Obama is going to raise taxes.  We do that much.  We do know that much about him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good news for you,  though.  I'm,  I'm,  I don't think your taxes are going up.  No,  yours probably will not go up.  He's going to be taxing the rich.  Exactly.  He's trying to help the middle class by taxing the rich a little bit more.  Yeah.  Which will cut down on the amount of jobs out there because people that run businesses are considered rich. 
[03:00:00]  So they will tax the shit out of them and they will have to lay people off.  Right.  But,  so what else do you like about Obama that he's going to give to the American people?  You've already said the opposite of what he's going to do.  Right.  Yeah.  Well,  I think he might give us another stimulus check.  I mean,  hell,  I got $600.  How is he going to do that?  Bush did that.  I thought you hate Bush.  Bush gave you a stimulus check.  Well,  still,  I think Obama would give me another stimulus check.  You,  how is he going to just give you a stimulus check? 
[03:00:30]  Put the phone,  no matter how much the phone stinks,  put it by your mouth.  Talking out your ass is really not working for you.  Yeah.  Oh,  baby.  Sir,  you don't know what you're talking about.  That's the only problem.  Oh,  baby.  Yeah.  So you're not a big fan of the Bush man,  huh?  Not really.  What else do you want Obama to do?  Continue the war?  Yeah.  Jesus.  What else do you want from Obama,  sir?  Or what is Obama going to do for you?  Well,  I seriously think that I just want lower gas prices because I drive all the way to Kansas 
[03:01:00]  City and St.  Louis almost all the time.  And it's killing me.  I mean,  I'm putting in 40,  50,  60 bucks in the SUV.  And it's just.  Get us some more car.  Well,  I like my SUV,  though.  Well,  I got to agree with you there.  He made a decision.  Got to agree with you there,  Mikey.  You're contributing to the problem.  Well,  anything else that you can't wait for Obama to do for you? 
[03:01:30]  Not really.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why don't you get a Prius?  Hey.  Yes.  Hey,  Nick.  Actually,  I like those.  Those things are pretty cool.  There you go.  Problem solved.  Pretty cool.  Hey,  Nick,  where are you right now?  In Warrensburg,  Missouri.  In,  no,  what,  like,  are you in your house?  Yeah.  What part of your house?  My room.  Yeah,  don't go in,  don't go in the living room. 
[03:02:00]  Why?  Because,  they're waiting for you.  Really?  The intervention people,  they're there waiting for you to come out of your room.  You're going to want to jump out your window and run.  Oh,  crap.  Run!  What are you on there,  sir?  A lot of people saying you might be on something.  What's your drug of choice there?  Vicodin.  Vicodin.  Nice,  right?  Nice.  Yeah.  Why are you on the Vicodin, 
[03:02:30]  sir?  What?  Yeah.  Why are you on the Vicodin?  Because,  it feels good.  How many do you do a day,  sir?  About,  like,  10.  What?  You do 10 Vicodins a day?  Yeah.  And why?  What,  what are you trying to cover up?  What kind of pain?  Well,  I don't know. 
[03:03:00]  Homosexuality?  Let's get into this.  Yeah,  pretty much.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you gay?  Yeah.  What?  Are you gay?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  Did I say that out loud?  A lot of times I just think that in the mirror.  We got jet lag,  uh,  Jimmy today,  by the way.  Jet lag,  Jimmy.  Oh,  God,  listen to that.  It's bubbling.  Yeah.  You have a cauldron in your head.  You just turned this guy on. 
[03:03:30]  He thought it was a cum bubble.  Ah.  So does,  uh,  mommy and daddy like your homosexuality?  They don't care.  So why the Vicodin then?  Because,  I love it.  All he wants for Christmas every year is a wider plunger.  He's got a shot for it.  All right,  Nick,  I don't know if we're going to get much more out of you.  Sorry.  Okay.  All right,  go Obama,  right,  sir?  Yeah.  All right,  thank you.  All right.  All right,  bye-bye. 
[03:04:00]  Bye.  There goes Nick in Missouri.  Let's get back to the phone call about the,  the Western burger,  right?  Uh,  yes,  that's where we were.  Back it up a little bit.  All right,  this bitch complaining about her stupid burger.  Oh,  I want to stab her.  I said,  I am not leaving the spot.  And I said,  I will call the police because I want my Western burger done right.  Now,  is that so hard?  Okay,  what exactly is it you want us to do for you?  I said,  I'll stay down here.  I want,  I want them to make me the right.  Ma'am,  we're not going to go down there and enforce your Western bacon cheeseburger.  What am I supposed to do? 
[03:04:30]  This is,  this is between you and the manager.  We're not going to go and enforce how to make a hamburger.  That's why,  that's not a criminal issue.  There's nothing criminal.  So I just stand here,  so I just sit here,  you need to calmly and rationally speak to the manager and figure out what to do between you.  She did come up and I said,  can I please have my Western burger?  She,  she said,  I'm not dealing with it.  She walked away because they're mopping the floor and it's all full of beds.  And they don't want to run,  they don't want to go through there.  And,  and,  ma'am,  then I suggest you get your money back and go somewhere else. 
[03:05:00]  This,  this,  this is,  this is not a criminal issue.  We can't go out there and,  and make them make you a cheeseburger the way you want it.  Well,  that is,  that,  you're supposed to be here to protect me.  What are we protecting you from?  A wrong cheeseburger?  No.  Is this like,  is this a harmful cheeseburger or something?  I don't understand what you want us to do.  Well,  just come down here.  I'm not leaving.  No,  ma'am,  I'm not sending the deputies down there over a cheeseburger.  You need to go in there and ask like an adult and either get your money back and go home. 
[03:05:30]  I can't stop asking like an adult herself.  I'm sitting here in my car.  I just want them to make my kids a,  a,  a Western burger.  Ma'am,  this is what I suggest.  I suggest you get your money back from the manager and you go on your way home.  Okay.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  Unbelievable.  What a fucking cunt.  What a fucking cunt.  What a dummy.  We're not going to enforce your fucking burger.  When her fucking job is to get that woman's burger made.  That poor lady picks the kids up from karate.  Oh,  just wants a Western burger. 
[03:06:00]  Those lazy bums don't want to slip on the sus.  Are you drowning in your own snot?  Yes,  I am.  I can't even listen to you anymore.  I'm a snot boy.  Can we make the snot tea,  please?  You definitely have plenty.  It regurgitates.  Yeah.  It's all clear right now.  All right.  You want one more of these phone calls?  We got plenty.  Which one we got left?  Domino's?  Domino's,  yes.  Domino's.  Here we go.  Would it be asking too much for the guy to, 
[03:06:30]  you know,  connect?  Of course not.  He could do it.  This poor person to Domino's.  Yeah.  Come on.  Help him out.  Is anyone going to acknowledge the huge fucking piano in the studio today?  Oh,  I didn't even notice it.  Holy shit. 
[03:07:00]  Are we,  anyone going to acknowledge that there's a massive baby grand in the studio today?  That isn't even a baby grand.  What is that?  That is a grand piano.  What song does Randy Newman play?  That's Randy Newman's piano?  Oh,  is it?  What's he play?  He's doing Rod and Fez today.  Don't play it.  Don't play it.  Do you know how to play?  No.  No.  Wireless player.  You don't know how to play?  Can you hear this note over the air?  Yeah. 
[03:07:30]  All right.  When you hear that note later on.  No.  No.  Oh,  Christ.  He just wiped a booger on that note.  He's going to be doing short people and land right on that. 
[03:08:00]  I was going to go with one of the lower keys so he can't do the Jaws theme, but I said,  fuck it.  When you hear that note later, there's going to be a nice little surprise.  Did he do the Jaws theme too?  No,  I'm just saying.  That's it.  Most people know how to do that,  that,  that,  that,  that,  that.  Oh,  I got a good one too, 
[03:08:30]  man.  Go look at it,  Jimmy.  It's still on the key.  Which one is it?  Oh no.  It's the one that goes,  boom.  Jimmy's looking for it.  Hope he's going over there to lend some assistance in finding said key.  Look for the one with the booger on it. 
[03:09:00]  It's easy.  With the smeared snot.  Hi.  There you go.  Remember that note.  Oh,  poor Randy Newman.  that made me fucking laugh.  What if he gets some kind of a cold because of that and ends up dying of pneumonia?  Oh,  wait,  wait.  Oh no.  What,  Jimmy?  Mike real quick.  I ain't going to hurt it. 
[03:09:30]  No,  no.  Come on,  Jimmy.  Is that the,  uh,  Mike?  Oh,  are people short? 
[03:10:00]  Are they?  Oh,  did you lace that one?  I ran out like eight of those keys.  Wait till you hear that note later.  That's what I call a booyah.  Booyah.  Booyah.  Oh,  wow.  That's awful.  Oh no.  Should we take a quick break?  Okay.  That's horrible.  I don't know. 
[03:10:30]  Now I'm going to have to listen.  There's a guy that knows exactly what note it was too.  Of course.  Bill from Portugal.  All right.  I'll read it.  Why did you guys put a booger on the F note?  Don't read this out loud or they'll know where you put it.  All right.  We'll,  uh,  take a quick break.  We got a pastor breaking into a woman's home to steal a couple things.  We got,  uh,  we can maybe squeeze in bombs and flubs.  Oh,  we should do that.  Yeah.  Let's do that as well.  Stay there.  Jimmy, 
[03:11:00]  you want to play along to this song?  Uh,  we got a grand piano in studio.  Watch out for one of the,  and we're learning that Randy Newman,  could someone get a mic on Jimmy?  And we're learning that Randy Newman is going to be performing on the Ron and Fez show.  I believe.  Is this hope?  Is this on?  Yeah,  that's on.  Okay.  Play along to short people.  I like it.  Turn up short people.  I like how Ops says Ron is going to be performing on Ron and Fez, 
[03:11:30]  I believe.  Oh no.  Oh no.  Oh no.  No,  he's not.  Jimmy's playing the piano with his ball bag.  Short people got no reason to live,  huh?  A fucking helmet and bag all over it. 
[03:12:00]  We wonder why we sit in this studio alone every day.  Fucking helmet,  shaft,  and bag all over that fucking thing.  It looked like you were shaping a hamburger patty.  You better pull the fucking white gloves on.  Oh my God.  All right.  Thank you.  Get rid of that short people thing.  What do they expect?  You can't leave a fucking piano.  How do you not expect someone to put their dick on it? 
[03:12:30]  That's true.  It's the first thing you think of when you see a piano.  I'd like it to get somebody like Duffy or something and put his ball bag underneath the  little top thing and then just let it fall down.  Oh,  nice.  See if we can take the pain.  Take the pain.  I wonder how much it was to rent that.  How the fuck did they get it up here?  It could be $10,  $20,  Jim.  Oh,  all right.  I thought more.  Yeah.  How'd they get it up here in pieces?  A piano mover.  But they had to put it together up here?  Didn't you?  No,  I would think maybe the leg. 
[03:13:00]  They brought it in from the sidewalk.  They lifted it up and then took one of these windows out.  Sure they did.  Yeah.  I would say freight elevator.  Roll it on a dolly on its side.  Put the legs on.  You're good to go.  Let's get this audio.  For those of you wondering.  We got a pastor with a perv switch, my friends.  Ah,  yes.  A church pastor is under arrest.  His congregation in disbelief.  48-year-old Scott Murray is accused of breaking into a woman's house and stealing a sex toy. 
[03:13:30]  And now he's facing felony burglary and larceny charges.  And members of New Covenant Church and Clyde are reeling.  Investigators say the incident happened late Friday night.  And by Saturday, he had turned himself in and quit his job.  What'd he do?  He broke into this woman's home and he stole her vibrator and her lube.  So what?  He should have said that he felt it was evil.  He was trying to protect you from the devil.  Oh,  very good.  Murray is facing felony charges, accused of breaking into a woman's house. 
[03:14:00]  Rummaging through her drawers and stealing a sex toy and a bottle of personal lubricant.  This is just unreal.  What's personal lubricant?  Oh,  well,  it's different than public lubricant.  It's got her name on it.  Different than the old public lubricant?  Yeah,  it's very personal.  She had it monogrammed with a W for whore.  This is just unreal.  That's just not what I can say.  It's just unreal.  The community is stunned.  The congregation is stunned.  And the church's senior pastor is heartbroken.  Who wouldn't be?  Who wouldn't be?  Huh? 
[03:14:30]  Who wouldn't be?  Yeah.  The reverend's in trouble.  Did he go stealing a dildo and lube?  How'd you know?  I just figured he would.  By the way,  stunned.  Stunned.  I'm stunned.  Broken.  Nick Hohnerkamp tells News 13 that he and his entire staff were shocked by these allegations.  He says he is deeply grieving for the victim in this terrible situation.  Shut up.  He is praying for her, praying for her family, and praying for Scott and his family.  Yeah.  And I'm sorry for the whole church, all the members. 
[03:15:00]  I'm just sorry for everybody that has to go through this.  All the members, even the dildo?  I mean, they don't have questions to ask him, and they're going to ask him why he did it.  And it's a question that may never get answered, but church leaders say they'll move on and move forward with a little prayer and a lot of faith.  They don't react this way when one of them molests a kid.  No.  No.  That poor dildo.  Yeah.  Personal lubricant.  Charlie has a pretty good point on line two here.  Charlie in New York City. 
[03:15:30]  Charlie?  Yes, Opie.  Hi, Charlie.  What do you expect from us?  We boo a comedian because he doesn't do a good job at a show, but it's okay for you to wipe your ball bag on an established songwriting piano?  Do you expect us to be better than that?  The difference is this, sir.  You never said it makes sense.  I'm not rubbing my balls on it while he's playing it.  I'm not interfering.  Booing him.  He was stuttering. 
[03:16:00]  He was mumbling.  He couldn't get the job done.  So he got booed.  I'm not saying he's a great comedian, but that night he didn't get the job done.  And maybe you go see him another time and he's great.  And, you know, that's all I got to say.  But you expect so much of us when you show us, you know, that what you guys do.  I learned it from you, okay?  Is that what you're trying to say?  That's exactly what he's saying.  Do as I say, not as I do. 
[03:16:30]  That's right.  Every parent knows that one.  Do what I say, not what I do.  Oh, we haven't shown...  Booyah to you, too.  We haven't shown Jimmy the booyah.  I like booyah.  Jimmy, do you know what booyah is yet?  I don't, but I've been hearing it a lot.  You need the sound, too.  All right.  Obviously, for the booyah.  Which one is this?  This?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, Jimmy, this is booyah.  This is the inside joke we're playing with the regular radio audience.  What the fuck?  Booyah! 
[03:17:00]  That guy.  I like to see, actually, part of the version where he gets...  Yeah, yeah.  Look, he pulls his penis out of her vagina, and then his balls out of her asshole.  Hence the booyah.  He pulls his balls out of her asshole, and they were in there.  He had...  Because you could hear the pop sound up.  That's why we told you to make the pop sound before the booyah.  He had his balls in her ass.  That's something.  How did he do that?  I don't know.  Just so he could say booyah. 
[03:17:30]  Booyah.  The real strange part, he was a white guy.  Before?  Yeah.  Put his balls in her ass, and they came out, oops.  Yes.  You guys want to try...  Oopsie on his balls.  How about we do bombs today, and then we do flubs tomorrow?  Hmm.  You want to do that?  Yeah, I'm sure I don't have any bombs in there, so let's start.  Yeah, sure.  One, two, three, four, five.  Oh, no.  No.  No.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  A couple? 
[03:18:00]  Here's the first bomb.  Get a good one.  This is bombs and flubs four.  Wow.  We did three probably a year and a half ago.  All right, here we go.  Bombs and flubs.  We start with Anthony.  Oh, damn it.  Yeah, so what do they do with this guy?  I don't know.  I mean, I don't know what they can do with him.  Do they take him out back and give him a beating?  No, of course not.  Send him down to Cuba.  Take the sick him on.  Let him hit him with the phone books.  Phone books in the belly.  Who are you working for? 
[03:18:30]  WAP.  With a Dick Tracy fedora on.  I'm going old school.  I don't know how to get out of this.  I'll say hi to him.  I don't know how to get out of this.  That was a bombing.  I was just, that was a carpet bombing.  I just kept going.  The next bomb.  And minefield.  The next bomb is from me.  I've been saying that men 18 plus is not the demo we should be shooting for. 
[03:19:00]  It's persons 15 to 17 and then women over 60.  That's our core.  That's what we're going to be gunning for now.  We want to talk about depend undergarments and bubble gum.  We want women with braces.  That's what we're shooting for.  That's right, on their legs.  So they can't run.  Often.  A polio joke.  Yeah.  I knew it, Bob, because I said, so they can't run right after and kick it in to hear me.  Yeah. 
[03:19:30]  All right.  Here's the next bomb.  Nothing really manly about the peacock.  Yeah.  So stupid me.  I'm like, oh, it's just animals that don't look manly.  They look gay.  All the decorative stuff is around his ass.  I know my thinking is unorthodox.  I'm sorry, but I didn't hear you.  I didn't hear you.  All right.  That's a double bombing.  That's definitely it.  I thought it was funny, all the stuff around his ass.  I'm still standing behind that joke.  I'm standing behind that joke.  All right. 
[03:20:00]  Here's Jimmy with the next bomb.  Yeah, good luck.  Thanks, man.  Apparently, Travolta's trying to figure out how to make domed cities because of global warming  and our environment.  So he's trying.  You think I'm kidding?  No.  No, I think that'd be cool as hell.  Guys, out of his mind.  He said something about domed cities and we have to look to other planets.  That he's right about.  Domed cities, he should shut his face because that's what his head looks like without the wig.  But how about nothing?  Well, this is a...  Nah. 
[03:20:30]  No.  This is uncomfortable.  His head looks like a domed city.  Yeah, I know.  It does, but who gives a shit when I say it?  I should have just thought it.  The next bomb is from Mr. Rich Voss.  You just start looking and going, I got to get out of here.  There's going to be traffic.  Tank explodes in Massachusetts.  Is it mass?  My dad drives an auto-trike in Massachusetts.  Wow, you're talking about a strike. 
[03:21:00]  That wasn't Alex.  I have never heard silence like that.  And I've been in the woods camping.  Fucking by myself and fucking Maine.  Holy shit.  Boss.  Here's, uh, Jimmy.  E-me.  E-me.  Hey, would you listen to that beautiful chorus of voices?  Thanks, kid.  It's Rocky meets Tony Dan.  Hey. 
[03:21:30]  Hey.  Sounds like Fonzie.  Huh?  Nothing.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Nothing.  Instead of Fonzie, I said Fagzie.  Wow.  Fagzie.  Ha, ha, ha.  E-yuck.  P-U.  Here's Imus and Sharpton on the Today Show.  This is the latest audio.  Although now there's even latest, latest audio because, uh, Jesse Jackson is talking time  this right now.  It's actually Imus and E-D-A-Mean.  Not a clip of me and that, uh... 
[03:22:00]  No.  Hold on.  Maybe my mic didn't work.  E-D-A-Mean.  Yeah.  It worked.  Shame, shame, shame, shame, shame on you.  We're cakes for nothing.  That was for you, Jimmy.  It's uncomfortable.  I don't like this.  Well, uh, the Steve C. story's coming in.  From Stephen S. from Bayshore.  A bear in chaps.  A C for Steve C. 
[03:22:30]  Wow.  A boyfriend.  A Nazi.  Wow.  Oh, shit.  A car crash.  But back in our real life time, that was fucking...  Wow, that was really just nothing.  I was alone in the room.  Yeah.  Half of the time, we're just not listening, though.  Well, we heard that one. 
[03:23:00]  Oh, yeah.  We heard that one, okay.  Oh, yeah.  You could have been yelling fucking a recall in the Grand Canyon.  Wow.  It looks like Ben holding the island.  Yeah, the set is on his cheek there, I think, right?  Okay.  Trying to tag your joke, and I should have just, like, let it go.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's wonderful.  I like that.  Okay. 
[03:23:30]  You lost faith in it halfway out.  I could hear it.  Oh, no shit.  And finally, we'll do flubs tomorrow, but here you go with the last bomb.  And now we go to E-Rock, who is keeping track of Jimmy's answers.  Jim Norton, according to this website, should be voting for who?  Jimmy tied for first place.  Absolutely.  Man keeps clean shirts.  That was the famous you really thought that was his name. 
[03:24:00]  Jimmy tied was a guy.  Yeah.  Jimmy tied.  Oh, fuck.  You want to do flubs?  We can do flubs.  Oh, no.  We got a few.  Let's go with it.  All right.  Let's do the flubs.  That was the bombs.  Here are the flubs.  That's why we don't go to the kids too often on this show.  Can't go to the kids too often.  She's stinging into a Susie Bake Oven.  Let's go to the, uh, Easy Bake Oven.  Oh, she called it Susie Bake.  Susie Bake Oven.  That's what the Germans put out. 
[03:24:30]  Susie Bake, I don't know any better.  Susie Bake Oven.  Hence a flub.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  What happened there?  Hold on.  What happened?  Rick Voss, DVD, Amazon.com.  This is a good place to leave it.  Amazon.com?  Did you just say Amazon.com?  Amazon.  That's where you should go for Voss's DVD. 
[03:25:00]  Amazon.com.  Amazon.com.  Amazon.  Amazon.  Voss is always good for one.  I hope Sherlock Holmes isn't here.  Sherlock Holmes.  I like this next one.  This is like incestuous abuse.  This has nothing to do with our topic of the day.  You have to call on incestuous abuse day.  Well, we're going to wait.  That's right.  That's usually Monday through Tuesday through Wednesday.  Oh, God.  Actually, tomorrow we're going to...  Oh, my God. 
[03:25:30]  Jimmy.  Monday through Thursday.  Sa, de, son, de, vans, de, fras, de, mal, de, mal, de, apolonia.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Very funny.  Imagine someone just, like, changes the title of your book like that.  Yeah, that would be awful.  Be horrible.  Poor OJ.  They don't buy the rights to my book.  They'll call us why I'm an anchorage slash third wheel. 
[03:26:00]  Why I'm a show wrecker.  Anchorage?  I know.  What are you?  Why I'm a city in Alaska.  That was a flum out of Bob.  Wow.  What a waste of ear energy for everyone to have to hear that.  Why I'm an anchorage.  Oh, that's fucking terrible. 
[03:26:30]  Why have a Timbuktu?  What a fucking cunt.  Oh, these are funny.  They just, ah!  They hand the camera to Christopher Reeve.  Oh, Christopher Reeve.  Damn it.  He's dead.  I meant Michael J. Fox.  Damn me.  Fuck.  So if the cigarettes are gone, okay, I won't get cancer.  But let me shove food in my fat feast until my morbid obesity. 
[03:27:00]  Did I say feast?  I was thinking obesity.  What did I say?  Shove food in my fat feast.  In my fat feast.  In my fat feast.  In my fat feast, you know.  It's so cute when Jimmy does that.  He just doesn't know what he's saying.  He gets ahead of himself.  Obese feast.  Here's the next one.  How would he wear shanks at night doing a hit?  It makes sense.  Because Omar says so. 
[03:27:30]  Says so.  Because Sosa says so.  Oh, yeah.  Sosa.  I'm dumb.  Omar got hung.  Omar didn't help.  You hear Otto?  Yeah.  He's got the great slap.  The next one is E-Rock.  This is a great one.  Ill-tempered and quarrelsome.  Disagreeable.  Disliked her cantankerous landlord. 
[03:28:00]  Difficult to handle.  Had to use liquid helium, which is super cold, costly, and tank-  Can-  Tankerous.  Oh, jeez.  Okay.  Tankankerous.  That was his made-up fucking name when he was in high school.  He thought he was tough.  His name was Tankankerous.  Tankankerous.  He would fantasize that he was Tankankerous.  Lady killer.  Captain of the football team.  Tankankerous. 
[03:28:30]  That's right.  And all the girls would go up, oh, tank.  And he always wore his trademark tank top.  Instead of fucking Pelican deck fucking jizz bag, he was Tankankerous.  Pelican deck.  Tankankerous.  Newest name on every message board is going to be Tankankerous.  That's right.  He didn't want to be flubbing cunt anymore.  It was Tankankerous in high school.  He would kneel on the bed, like kneel on the side of the bed and hold in his shits 
[03:29:00]  and just fantasize about getting respect and having a shirt with a TH on it.  Tankankerous.  Fuck you.  My boyfriend Tank is coming.  And he'd pretend that he walked in and he was Tank with his fucking shitty flock of  seagulls hairdo.  What the fuck?  Just beat him up.  Just go in there and punch him in the face.  No, he might be Tank.  Tankankerous.  His alter ego, Tank.  Don't make me angry.  You wouldn't like me when I'm angry. 
[03:29:30]  Or when I'm not.  Look at this thing on MSNBC.  Wow.  What the fuck is she?  A woman bills state for gas.  She was stuck in traffic and decided to bill the state.  That's good.  That works.  I wonder what Tank would have done.  Tankankerous?  Or...  Oh, Tank.  Tank, you got anything to say?  That's you. 
[03:30:00]  No.  Not a word.  Why would it?  It's perfect.  Why would he go with that?  You've surprised them with your improv of silence.  Yeah, why didn't Tank chime in?  Oh, he's got nothing.  What's he doing?  Hi, guys.  Are you doing...  He's doing a voice?  He's doing Tank.  E-Rock, what kind of voice could you do?  Hmm.  What do you think?  Yeah, come in studio. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah, we need you to become Tank.  Yeah, we need you to work on your Tank.  Tankankerous voice.  It's got to be your tough guy.  Captain of the football team.  Lady killer.  You're wearing a Tank top.  Your name's Tankankerous.  And you've been the darling of the school sports program.  That's right.  And don't do my Tank.  Because I do a little character on the show every once in a while.  Tank, the sports guy.  Oh, Jesus.  What's he doing? 
[03:31:00]  That's right.  He said a Tank top, not a fucking midriff.  Yeah, there's a difference between...  Tank top is...  No, you keep rolling up like that.  It's not staying.  Tank would do that.  Of course it's not.  It's embarrassing for you.  All right, Tank.  All right.  What do you got?  What's up, Jim?  I'm Tank.  Oh.  Hi, Tank.  What's going on?  Not much.  Love your book.  Thanks, Tank.  I didn't pick you for a reader. 
[03:31:30]  I didn't pick Tank to be so complimentary and gentle.  Strong, but silent, Tank.  Wow.  So how's the wrestling going, Tank?  Don't do wrestling.  Football.  It's always good in improv.  Say no.  You do football.  Oh, okay.  What position?  I am running back.  But you're not black. 
[03:32:00]  You could be the quarterback or something.  Yeah, you're quarterback or like running back.  I mean, why?  The black kids are always the running backs.  We didn't have black kids in high school.  This sounds more like shit heteros.  All right.  That went well.  All right, Tank.  And scene.  Once again, Iroh helping out the show.  It's sex.  It's sex.  Then again, it's boring.  It's really our fault.  Kids in their mind in his business trying to not play sound clips when we need them. 
[03:32:30]  And we say, hey, your new name's Tank Hankorous.  Go with it.  Become Tank Hankorous for us.  Yeah, exactly.  Beat Brando in fucking 68.  Improv.  Go.  Why 68?  On the waterfront?  He was just young then.  No, on the waterfront.  Jesus, what am I talking about?  My God.  Here's another flop.  I heard she got the dog from Jack Jack.  Same place.  Steve from Bayshore.  She got the dog from Jack Jack?  From Jack Jack.  The cat handed over a dog.  The cat handed over a dog.  Yeah.  Wow. 
[03:33:00]  Pardon, pardon, pardon.  Yeah, that was.  Yeah, it was going on out there.  I hear Steve.  I can't go back there right now, but later on.  Can't go back where?  To the world of women?  He can't even walk through the hall.  What were you talking about, Steve? 
[03:33:30]  I can't go back there now.  You can't go back to where?  I fucking, I was talking to Derek about a sweeper he made, and I told him I couldn't  listen to it right now.  Why?  What are you doing?  That's important.  Listening to the show.  And I didn't want to go back to production, and then it missed something.  So I told him I couldn't go back there right now.  And as I said it, I realized I said something very incriminating past an open mic.  Oh, yes, you did.  Yes.  I'm just foggy one notch.  That's the remaining one.  You poor bastard. 
[03:34:00]  Is this a daily event for you?  You go through this hell all the time.  Hey, Steve.  Nature Spree doesn't clear that up.  Steve, I got a question for you.  Yeah, go ahead.  What is E-Rock's new name?  What is that?  Hank Tankerous.  Was that right?  Yeah.  Let's just put it this way.  You had plenty of time to go visit Derek.  Or Tank Hankerous, or whatever the fuck it was.  Yeah.  Fuck, I was so close.  Hank Tankerous.  Well, that's close enough. 
[03:34:30]  But you're listening to the show, so that's good.  Tank Hankerous is a tough one to remember.  Yeah, sure.  All right, and finally, the last flub of this.  E-Rock's improv was awful.  Tank, hi, Tank.  You always know someone does nothing when they start asking questions.  What's going on?  Yeah.  Hey.  How you doing?  Love your book.  Yeah.  Thanks.  Strong, silent type.  Exactly.  So he doesn't have to talk.  Exactly.  How about the verbose, funny type?  Well, the peeps are demanding, and all Tank Hankerous, 11 o'clock. 
[03:35:00]  What a nightmare.  Tank Hankerous feeds on cum.  Cum eater.  Fucking cum eater.  He's a big bully by day, but he likes to eat the cum out of nerds' hands.  That's how you quiet Tank Hankerous, is you cum in your hand, and you, hey boy, and he  kneels down and lapses.  He won't hurt you.  He won't be the bully he is during the day.  Christ.  What's wrong with your kid?  Well, either she's toothing, or her tits are swore. 
[03:35:30]  Swore.  Swore.  Toothing?  Toothing?  Is that toothing, or her tits are swore?  Did you just say teething?  Oh, God, Jimmy.  Right on.  That's not too bad.  Who put this together there?  Travis, bombs, and flubs for?  How did you have none?  In the books.  You had no flubs.  I'm perfect, Jimmy.  Because everyone's scared of me.  What can I tell you?  That can't be possible.  I flubbed more than anyone. 
[03:36:00]  I know that.  But none.  What?  There's more of that as well.  All right, we'll do more.  Why don't they put together fucking, just put like fucking eight of each.  Or ten of each.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Quiet.  Quiet.  Stop it.  All right.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:36:30]  It's that time of the show.  Is it?  That's the nasal spray.  Is it?  Yeah.  Is it working?  You think Randy is going to be pissed when his finger goes into a nice snot?  I can do that one.  That's right.  God damn.  It's time for Sam's wrestling promo.  Oh.  Sam, what's going on with the WWE and you and E-Rock?

[03:52:30]  Relating to that subject  He added  It's very emotional and a very powerful song  Not like anything that people are used to Paul McCartney doing  In the song, Sir Paul says  Miss Mills rescued him from the dark days  After the death of his first wife, Linda, from breast cancer in 1998  And she charged me a hundred million pounds  No shit  She rescued you  The lyrics read  I was awakened by magic  I was alone in this world  Take me away from here  Where, reality?
