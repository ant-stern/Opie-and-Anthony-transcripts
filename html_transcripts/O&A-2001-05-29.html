<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, transitioning rapidly between segments. The show began with a recap of their experience at the WBCN River Rave in Boston, contrasting it favorably with a K-Rock event.  They recounted encounters with various musicians, including Green Day (who famously trashed their studio in the past), Steven Tyler of Aerosmith, Marilyn Manson (who surprisingly wasn't very "rockstar-like"), and members of the Black Crows.  This segment heavily featured a physical altercation between Opie and Stevie Richards of the WWF at the River Rave. Opie described Richards choking him during a supposedly planned skit, resulting in a painful and genuinely un-staged fight.  A caller, Robbie, corroborated the incident, though with some differing details on the timeline.  The video of the altercation was circulating online.  The hosts also discussed their impending departure from their radio station and speculated about potential programming changes. A call from their former general manager, Bruce Mittman, followed, filled with reminiscing about past escapades and damage control.

The show then shifted to a more rambling discussion.  It began with a Vermont Teddy Bear Company commercial, followed by a story about a short, pizza-loving former boss and his unorthodox SUV entry method via a rope ladder.  They further discussed their experiences at a Marilyn Manson concert and another call from Bruce, who expressed his desire for a less stressful job.  Earl, promoting a "Wow" sticker shop, called in, recounting a funny interaction with Yankee Bernie Williams.  Opie shared a story about getting a speeding ticket for crossing railroad tracks as the gates were lowering, despite attempting to use his PBA card (which failed because the officer wasn't a fan of the show).  The conversation meandered through topics such as Pearl Harbor (deemed boring except for the bombing), Al Sharpton's hunger strike,  the hosts' speeding tickets, their encounters with Green Day, and a behind-the-scenes anecdote about an NSYNC music video involving an injured band member and a stand-in.  They promoted an NSYNC ticket contest and discussed the book "The Dirt" by Mötley Crüe, focusing on Nikki Sixx's near-fatal heroin overdose and an incident where his bandmates almost threw him in a dumpster.  The hosts also discussed their opinions on *Shrek*, with one host mentioning bringing a blanket to the theater.  Rockaway Bedding was also promoted.

A substantial portion of the show centered on a debate about *Shrek*, focusing on the film's message about inner versus outer beauty.  The hosts engaged in a heated discussion, using vulgar language, about whether the princess's transformation into an ogre was a positive or realistic life lesson.  Callers, including Frank, shared their views.  Another caller criticized Eddie Murphy’s performance.  The conversation abruptly shifted to a news story about a 56-year-old man undergoing a sex change and selling his testicles to fund the procedure.  The hosts discussed this with offensive language and humor, speculating on his motivations and the lack of a market for testicles.  A tangent involving the hosts' experiences using women's restrooms ensued.  Further callers offered opinions on both *Shrek* and the sex change story.  The hosts also discussed the physical changes women undergo as they age, using crude and sexually suggestive language.  An "Auto Lock Pro" car security device was promoted. The show concluded with a discussion about a morbidly obese woman requiring a rescue from her apartment, leading to more caller discussion on body image and relationships.  Concert ticket giveaways continued throughout this final segment.

[00:00:00]  1027 WNW  Look at Ben playing a couple songs from the River Rave Anthony  The River Rave, that's right  That's where we were this weekend  Green Day, Welcome to Paradise  Arrow Smith before that, back of the saddle again  It's the O&A Show  212-757-1027 is our phone number  We've got to get right into the show today 
[00:00:30]  We can't fool around with a cute sound effect  No  We don't have much time left, we've got to get it all in  Oh!  Why, how many days technically?  Technically we have the 29th  I think we only have three days left on our contract  Today, the 30th, the 31st  That's it, right?  You know what's funny?  Management finally realized that we're dead serious about leaving  And now they're scurrying trying to figure it all out 
[00:01:00]  Yeah  They thought we were bluffing or something  That's pretty interesting, let's say  So now it's, yeah, it's today, Tuesday, Wednesday, and then Thursday  Now they're running around with their heads chopped off  Trying to figure out what they can do  Are we going to have a three-day weekend?  Or, you know, Friday  Technically, technically we're, you know  We don't have to work Friday  No?  Technically  No, I'm serious  I don't know what's going to happen  Slappy and Wappy come in? 
[00:01:30]  All I know is we're dead serious about leaving  And the company finally figured that out  And now they're running around like crazy  Yeah  Trying to figure out what they can do  But we don't want to bore you with that right now  No  And we got to talk about our trip to Boston this weekend  What a bang-up time we all had  We had a lot of fun, man  We were invited to the WBCN River Rave  It's kind of sad that we have to go to another city  To enjoy one of these fine music festivals  Because, yeah  Because the rock station that we own in New York City hates our guts 
[00:02:00]  So we have to go somewhere else to see some fine bands play  It kind of sucks  I'll tell you one thing, though  Thank God it's that way  Better than the other way around  Because as I'm driving back from Boston  After this kick-ass show that WBCN put on up there  Unbelievable  Just the names of the acts  I mean, you got Aerosmith, Marilyn Manson, Green Day, Live  And just a crap load of other bands that were there 
[00:02:30]  Black Crows  Yeah, Black Crows  Did you enjoy Life House, Anthony?  No  That looked like your cup of tea, Life House  Really?  That's the type of tea I drink  Right there's a band selling an S-load of albums  I know  That's huge  So driving back from that show  You know what I think about Life House, not to interrupt you?  The drummer was wearing a Missing Persons concert T-shirt  Really?  I thought that was kind of cool  It's not every day you see, like, Missing Persons concert T-shirts  No  Go ahead, sorry, you were driving back  But you come back from a kick-ass show like that 
[00:03:00]  And you hear ads for the dysfunctional family picnic  I guess K-Rock's putting on  And it just pales in comparison  And it's the same company  I'm not dissing any company  Because it's all the CBS Infinity family  But they, I mean, they put on a friggin' show, man  Foxboro Stadium, packed  Huge  It's a stadium  They play football there  You know?  And then you come back and you hear, you know, bands that are playing  And it just seems a little pale in comparison 
[00:03:30]  Well, yeah, they had it going on  They had  How many bands played, seriously?  30?  Between the two stages, right?  Yeah  And then the DJs included  Then they had the rave tent  Where all the little girls on E were hanging out with their glow sticks  Yeah  Holy ass  Holy ass  What a great time, though  Who went?  It was me and Opie and our chicks  Ben  Ben went  Black girl  Black girl  And we hooked up with our buddy Jay  Right  From up in Boston 
[00:04:00]  Soon to be coming down here, thank God  Yeah  Funny son of a bitch  Very funny guy  And, yeah, we were all hanging out  Our never-ending quest for beer  And we had a great time, though  Yeah  Hanging kind of  Kind of  The backstage thing  Well, we went backstage  I guess we could start by running into the gang from Green Day  Yeah  Oh, that was a bad  That's always funny  Hey, I thought you guys got fired  They go, hey  You guys are like the ones that got fired for saying the mayor died, right?  True  Right  So, are you 
[00:04:30]  You guys are really funny and stuff  You still doing radio somewhere else?  Hey, butt plug  Hey, stop  You're gonna read me  Completely remembered us  They were freaking out  It was hysterical  Now, they want to come on our show  Yep  And Green Day's coming down here in a couple weeks  Mm-hmm  But, you know what?  I'll say it right on the radio  Somebody  Mm-hmm  Who will remain nameless  Said that it's gonna be tough to get Green Day on the show  Because Steve Kingston from K-Rock  Yeah  Will block Green Day from coming on our show 
[00:05:00]  Even though Green Day wants to come on our show  Yeah  And they want to hang out with us  Yeah  Because they enjoy us  We hung backstage for well over an hour and a half  Yeah  Talking about everything besides music  Yeah, it was a good time  And they're like, look  We will look you up in New York  But we have a feeling that we will be blocked from going on your show  Mm-hmm  Because Steve Kingston plays hardball  And is a real sea sucker when it comes to this stuff  That's exactly what'll happen  I'm like, great  And what's he really gonna do?  Like, not play Green Day? 
[00:05:30]  I don't know  You know, it's the  You know what it is?  It's the record company that's got to just  No, see, but the record  The band doesn't care  I know  It's the record company that gets all scared and stuff  Right  So we'll see what happens  You know, that's one of the things that has to change if we're gonna stay here  Yeah  We need to get some of these music acts on our damn shelf  Especially when they're friends of ours  I consider them friends  So do I  They said it was the best interview they ever did  When we had them live in our studio in Boston  Where we were, like, getting high and drinking beers 
[00:06:00]  And we completely destroyed the studio  Yeah, because it's not like  They'll never forget it  It's not like doing a radio interview  They even said, we still have the CDs you guys gave us  Because we told them to get rid of all the crappy CDs from the studio  So we gave them, like, Jethro Tull CDs and Winger CDs and Warrant CDs  They go, you guys, you still have those  Hey, you're eating  So that was fun running into those guys  And what a show they put on, man  Oh, my God  The end of their set  They completely destroy their stuff  And it sounds like, all right 
[00:06:30]  You know, you've seen bands smash their stuff  Well, it's kind of cliche, Anthony  Big whoop  But no, I mean  They did it, like, tenfold  They smashed the crap out of their stuff  Then they poured lighter fluid on everything  And lit it  To, I mean  To the dismay of the fire marshals that were there  And the stage crews  Who come running out with fire extinguishers  Trying to put the stuff out  And Trey grabs more lighter fluid  And starts spraying it on the smoldering mess  And it goes  Back up again 
[00:07:00]  I mean, these guys  They were taking that whole  Breaker equipment thing to the extreme  To that next level  Yeah  That was kind of cool  Yeah  So it was fun hanging with Green Day  We're hanging out  We're hanging backstage with Green Day  And Stephen Tyler came up to us and said hi  Yeah  And said thanks for the support, guys  Which is cool  Very cool  Because we're starting to be considered  Like a rock and roll talk show  I kind of like that  Yeah  Stephen goes, hey  We had a great time with you guys on the air  You know, a few weeks back  Thanks for the support  Blah, blah, blah  And then they went on stage 
[00:07:30]  And they kicked ass  Yeah  They only played five songs, though  I know  What the hell was that about?  It's their home crowd  Festival show  You know, a lot of bands  I think they want you  Leave you wanting more  And what was the first song they did?  They did Beyond Beautiful  Then they did Back in the Saddle  Then they did Jaded  And then they did Sweet Emotion  And then Train Kept the Rollin'  Train Kept the Rollin'  That was awesome  At least they didn't pull your Armageddon ballad out  No, no  No, they just rocked  You know  And the Black Crows had a great set  And Joe Perry came out to jam 
[00:08:00]  To Fleetwood Max O'Well  Kate Hudson was hanging on the side of the stage  During the set  To try to move in  Trying to move in  Trying to move in on them  You know that Chris Robinson and Kate Hudson  They were there for a total of 30 seconds  They arrived in their limo  Went right to the stage  Chris Robinson and the Crows did their thing  Kate Hudson was on the side of the stage  As soon as it was over  Boom  Gone  They were out of there  They were the only ones that didn't hang  We hung with everybody else  We hung with Fatboy Slim  You were hanging from 
[00:08:30]  Ian Asbury  Yeah, from the cult  From the cult  He's kind of wacky, that guy, man  He's like  First of all  He wears his head in this babushka thing now  Right?  A la  What's his name?  The guy from the surprise  That looks like, yeah  What's his name from  Oh, yeah  Yeah  Little Stevie  Yeah  Little Steven  And he's got that whole thing on  But he's also got this big robe thing on  Like he's a monk  And his hands are always in the perpetual praying position  And as he's talking 
[00:09:00]  He's kind of shaking his head up and down like yes  And moving his prayer hands forward and backwards  Like, Jesus  What kind of wacky religion did you find?  The crowd wasn't digging the cult that much  I was kind of surprised  No  I was kind of surprised  And then we saw Marilyn Manson backstage without his makeup  Yeah  He had his big rosy sunglasses on  The rear admiral  The nerdiest guy I've ever seen in my life  Oh, yeah  Of course  He is completely different when he's not on that stage  Yeah  I hate seeing, like, these rock guys backstage 
[00:09:30]  You know  It takes away from the mystique of it  The guy was as nerdy as they come  You know what was really funny with him?  We were sitting down in the tent area  That the bands have to walk through to get to the stage  And it's one thing when you see Marilyn Manson on stage  And the lights are there  And he comes out and does his thing  It's totally another thing to watch him walking to the stage  With his ass hanging out of those bands  Like, out of his element  You know, because there's couches and people are hanging out  It's like some naked, half-naked guy walking through your living room 
[00:10:00]  Right  He's kind of looking up  Looks weird until he gets on the stage  Ben ended up partying with those guys after the Riverhead Saturday night  Those sickos  He was hanging out with most of the guys from Marilyn Manson  Yeah  And some of the clubs in Boston  And they're ordering the good stuff  Dude, they're completely normal  We're ordering Dom Perignon  Talking about what gourmet restaurant they're going to go to  And they're, like, totally normal  Yeah  Just, like, totally cool  And this bimbo waitress is like  Oh, I want to get into the music business 
[00:10:30]  And they're, like, totally picking her up  You know, meanwhile, we're in a place  These guys look like mutants, you know  The funny thing about Manson, though  The biggest thing about backstage  She had noticed that every, like, hot chick back there  Went up to him and was, like, all over him  Yeah  It was, like, normal girl  So it wasn't like  Man, they should see him without the makeup  It's a whole different game  Yeah  Whole different story  Another thing I noticed while being up there, of course  Again, the whole Yankee thing  Now, it doesn't matter what event you go to in Boston 
[00:11:00]  I'm convinced if on Sunday morning  I went to a church up there  The priest would be up there just saying  Yankee suck  Right  Yankee suck  And everyone would start screaming and chanting Yankee suck  Everywhere you go  Every event I've ever been to in Boston  Whoever's up there on stage starts the Yankee suck chant  And everyone gets behind it  And you think about it when you're here in New York  And you go to shows  Or anywhere  You never hear  Red Sox suck every two seconds  It's assumed 
[00:11:30]  They're up by everyone  They are so obsessed with the Yankees up there  They truly are  You know what's funny about going back to Boston?  The whole area is filled with Psycho Marks  It's hilarious  Like, Psycho Mark is  Now I feel like Psycho Mark comes from another planet  And that planet is Boston  Because they all, like  They all kind of sound like him  Hey, Bobby  Right  But they're all just slightly different than Psycho Mark  But there's just a bunch of, like, Psycho Mark clones everywhere  I mean, he's the loudest and most obnoxious 
[00:12:00]  But, man, it was funny  Want to go to the phones here?  Sure  Let's go to Damien  Damien, what's up, man?  Yeah, I read and saw the video that you guys got in a fight with Stephen Richards from the WWF  Oh, yeah, the Stephen Richards debacle  Has anyone noticed my voice yet today?  Having a bit of a time, are you?  Holy  Was that real or fake?  Let me explain this  Because we're getting a lot of heat from this stupid thing  Let me hang up on you  We'll explain, okay? 
[00:12:30]  Okay  Yeah, the WWF was up there  Stephen Richards or Steve Richards  Stevie Richards  Whatever the hell  Right to censor, I guess  His little group  Whatever that douchebag calls himself  Because I'm pissed  And I'll tell you in a minute here  The Raven was there and Molly Holly, right?  Yeah  And a bunch of representatives from the WWF  They're filming all sorts of things  For Sunday Superstars, whatever that show is  Yeah  All right  And they go, hey, guys, you know  We want you to do something, you know, with Stevie Richards  Yeah 
[00:13:00]  Or Steve Richards  So it's like, okay  And we kept blowing them off  Because we were hanging  We were really having a good time, man  I wanted to meet Fatboy Slim  After a while, though  They kept dragging  Right  So we're like, all right  All right, no problem  So we go up and they have this idea that, you know  Steve Richards is, you know  Going to talk about how our show shouldn't be on the airwaves  Because he does his whole right to censor thing  Yeah  And how, not only that  But how the whole scene taking place at the River Rave  Was just too bad 
[00:13:30]  With all the sex and the rock music and everything  How horrified he was  Right  And we were, you know  I was going to talk sense to him  Right  So he goes, let's just go with it  You know, I'm going to trash you guys and your show  And, you know, you give it back to me  Yeah  All right  Then he whispers to me  He goes, oh, I'm going to choke you  But don't worry about it  It'll be cool  He goes, it'll be fine  I won't hurt you, okay  Last time was Richard Belzer and the Hulkster, if you remember  Right  And Belzer ended up getting choked out  And his head split open  Right  But he warns me ahead of time 
[00:14:00]  He goes, I'm going to choke you  But it's not going to hurt, okay  Sure  I'm like, fine  Just the wrestler  I think I really got to him  I swear to God  Because I was just playing it, you know  All the way  Making fun of his tie  We both were just going at it with him  Yeah  I was pointing out, like, hot chicks that walk him  I go, well, look at that  Right  Look at those cans  What's wrong with you?  I go, I think maybe a little light in the loafers or something  You're not into girls  Right  That's why you're doing it  No, let me tell you  I'm into respecting women and blah, blah  So we're going to be choked  Right  I heard it  Okay  Let me go on record 
[00:14:30]  I once in Geneseo  Punched a brick wall  Because I got bad grades  And broke my hand  Yeah  I broke my ankle  I've had a lot of breaks in my life  As far as, you know  Playing sports and things  Worst pain I've ever felt in my life  Happened Saturday when he was choking me  He was choking you  He said it wasn't going to hurt  You know, it'll be fine, okay  Now at one point  Opie just taunts him one more time  He spins around  Grabs you kind of by  The back of your  Shoulder, neck area 
[00:15:00]  With one hand  Right  And then puts his other hand  Directly over your throat  Right  And now he's squeezing  And lifting Opie off the ground  So he's just barely  Like, you can see  Your tippy toes  Are just kind of touching enough  That you weren't being hung  See, there's a video  That's circulating  You don't see that my leg  My feet are off the ground  The guy lifted me up by my neck  And was choking me  Yeah  Worst pain I've ever felt  Going, holy ass  I can't breathe  I was turning beet red 
[00:15:30]  And you and everyone else there  Thought it was all part of the gag  So I just jump on his back  Right  I go, hey, let go of my radio partner  What are you doing?  Right  You know  I'm kind of trying to  Trying to  Like  I don't know what I was trying to do  To tell you the truth  Because there was nothing  I could do to this guy  I was on his back  Yeah, the Heimlich  I was giving him the Heimlich  Right  I'm on his back  And it was nothing to him  As he's choking open  Right  And I've got to say it again  You don't see it  Here's a picture of it  I am off the ground 
[00:16:00]  He is lifting me up  By my neck right there  And you're  You're pretty much  Hugging him  I'm hugging him  At this point  I think this picture is on one of the websites out there  I'm like a bitch  So he finally lets me go  And it seemed  I swear to God  It seemed like forever  That he was choking me  And then he flipped you over his back  Right?  Yeah, after he  He like kind of threw you  Like enough with him  And then he realized  There was a gnat  Or a tick  Or something  On his back  And he just  He just kind of threw his arm back 
[00:16:30]  I tumbled  And hit the pavement  On my elbow and shoulder  Right  From right off his back  Right  Like he did nothing  To get me off of him  But I flew  He says he's like 230 pounds  Yeah  Not an ounce of fat on him  No, no  The guy is really strong  So I start catching my breath  And I'm like  Holy  What the F just happened?  And he comes running up to me  He goes  Did I hurt you?  Did I hurt you?  He goes  I just got caught up in the whole thing  And I apologized  I'm like  You said you weren't going to like

[00:28:00]  What did you learn  On the show today?  What I learned today  This bit's still tough  The Opie and Anthony Show  106  The Opie and Anthony Show  On 1027 WNAW  Black Crow is definitely  One of the highlights  From the BCN River Rave  Up there in Boston  We had a lot of fun  This weekend  Yeah  Opie's not here though  Right now  It's Opie Clifton  Was not fitting in  For Opie 
[00:28:30]  Black Crow is one of those bands  They were born too late  Yeah, they would have been in  Well around the time  The Stones were really big  Sure  They would have fit in  Quite nicely  With like Humble Pie  And those guys  In the 70s  You know  Yeah  Smoking all their pot  Hey, we lost the guy  That filmed the fight  Oh no  Is that him, Robbie?  Is that him again?  Yeah, okay 
[00:29:00]  If you're just tuning in  I got choked really, really bad  By Stevie Richards  From the WWF  Right to censor  Crack guy  Yeah  Douche nozzle  He warned me  That he was going to choke me  We were like  Doing a little skit  For the WWF  One of their TV shows  They may show the footage  Who knows  And the guy really choked me  And lifted me up  By my neck  And was swinging me  And thought it was all fun  Yeah  I'm here to say  It was the worst pain 
[00:29:30]  I've ever felt in my life  Was it actual pain  Or panic?  Pain and panic  Because when you're being choked  It's like  Well, there's nothing  I can do about this  And I'm really going to die now  Anthony, if you want to know  What I felt like  Go like this  No, I had Norris do that to me  Okay  Remember I was telling you  Just last week  When Norris tried to demonstrate  This karate movie he does  And he put my throat  In the crook of his arm  By his elbow  And just squeezed  For two seconds  And I went  God  Yeah, just take your windpipe  Like this and squeeze  No  As hard as you can 
[00:30:00]  I'm not going to do that  For about 15 seconds  And you tell me  If it was panic or pain  I won't do that  I was freaked out  And the guy said  It wouldn't hurt  And then he  Afterwards was like  Oh my god  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  I just kind of got lost  In the moment  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  As I try to gain my breath  Robbie  Yes  You filmed the damn thing?  Yeah, I was the guy  Who was sitting with him  Right behind you guys  I wasn't the WWF camera crew  I want to see these good friends  And I was the one  Right behind you guys  Taping it the whole time  Alright, so the video  Everyone  Don't be really mad 
[00:30:30]  The video that everyone's  Checking out on the website  That's your video?  Yeah, I took that video  Oh, thank god  Because you're not that good  At filming, man  Well, I'm not a pro  No, I mean  Because I'll tell you why  Because he lifted me up  By my neck  And you can't see that  In your video  That I'm off the ground  Well, what he said  To me afterwards  Was he didn't start  Choking you for real  Until Anthony  Jumped on his back  And then he slipped  And just clamped down  Slipped and clamped down  They stink  He's laughing outside  Robbie, I'm here to say that 
[00:31:00]  He was choking me  Right from the beginning  Really?  And then it got worse  And probably that's when  Anthony jumped on his back  Or whatever  Yeah, he said he felt really bad  Because as soon as he jumped  On his back  He clamped down  He's like, I was choking him  For real  Yeah, I know he was  And everyone's around laughing  Like, oh, look  They set up a cute little bit  Maybe they'll be on the WWF show  You know what I'm saying?  Like, no one around me  Understands that  He is choking the life  Out of me right now  But I had to come on here  To clear his name on two fronts 
[00:31:30]  Because he's in Canada right now  Right  And can't be reached  Well, we want to have him  On the show today  Well, I have a cell phone number  But I tried to call  And Canada  There's no reception for him  Oh, all right  Well, if you can hunt him down  We'd love to talk to him today  Because that was  That was a little twisted  And then I went up to him afterwards  Like, what were you thinking?  He goes, man, I'm sorry  He did say exactly  What you just said  What the hell were you thinking?  The one thing I wanted  To make sure I pointed out  Is the girl who was following  Him around backstage  Had nothing to do with him 
[00:32:00]  Oh, no?  No, she was just following him around  Because he was famous  He has a very beautiful fiancé  Oh  Who could be listening to this  So I wanted to clear his name  All right  I actually saw them  Having some kind of sex  Yeah  No, I was around him  The whole time  I don't know what she was doing  On her knees  Behind the trailer  But, hey  Who am I to say?  One good joke  That's right  I guess I wasn't the only one  Getting choked  But they said it wasn't  Going to be on WFTV  Probably  So that's why I put it up 
[00:32:30]  On the site  All right  That's cool  Great  I got choked for nothing  All right  But I will pass on  The message to him  All right, Robbie  Thank you  Get in touch with you  All right  Thank you very much  Robbie from  What is it?

[00:35:00]  Like an AOL screen name  Well, I thought you know who he was  If he works there  No clue  I don't know who that is  So, just like you  We don't know who the source is either  Maybe he's not a real source  Are you getting your info from Deep Throat?  No  All right  Sure  All right 
[00:35:30]  Let's go  Long dead by now  All right, let's go  What do you have on our current situation?

What else?  The sports guys will be replaced by 
[00:36:00]  Two new people who have very little experience  Or brother weed  Depending on if you sign or not  Uh  Wrong  That's an absolute wrong  The sports guys have already been replaced  20 times over  Think about it  The original sports guys are now gone  Oh  Okay  All right  What else?  Um  Ron and Fez will move to 7 to 11  And Don and Mike will move to your slot if you leave  Oh  Well  I might even give you some of that  That's a possibility  We don't know what would happen here if we left 
[00:36:30]  But that seems logical  Sure  All right  Um  Radio check will take the rest of her slot  That's definitely a possibility  Okay  Don't know anything  And they'll sign with uh  Q104.3  Who will?  Clear channel  Who will?  You will  You will?  Yeah  All right  Who's the source?  But that's been speculated already  Yeah  Yeah  All right  What else?

[00:58:30]  How tall was he  Like he was like  A midget  Yeah he was a little  Bigger than a midget  But smaller than a person  Yeah he was a short  Little prince  Yeah that's our old boss  Right there  And Pearl Harbor  Sucked  Did it  Why  It was so boring  For the first  I don't know  Hour and a half  Or whatever  I didn't care  Once the bombing started  I didn't care  I was bored  Where am I still  I wanted to go  That's why  I'm just waiting  I swear to god  I will walk into that movie  Right when the bombing starts  And leave right when it's over  That's all I care about 
[00:59:00]  I'll pay for a 40 minute movie  Anthony  Yeah  You got to talk about  Reverend Al and his hunger strike  Oh we are  I think we're going to get  Reverend Al on the phone  From his jail cell  Where he's having his hunger strike  A little later  That's going to happen  In a little bit  Thank you bud  Anthony really fast  We got pulled over yesterday  Yeah you  I'm so glad that the cops  That are less than a mile  From my house  Are very supportive  Of the O&A show  Now what did you do  Because I know with me  It's usually speeding  I was playing Bonnie and Clyde 
[00:59:30]  Bonnie and Clyde  Yeah  I was  The railroad crossing  Was coming down  And I said to myself  I can make it  See  Now this is a bad  Bad thing  I wasn't stopped  I was just going  He could have got me  For speeding too  Now that I think about it  How far were you  From the crossing  When the lights started  And the gates  Starts coming down  I don't know  A good couple hundred yards  I guess  A couple hundred yards  Which you can make up  In a couple seconds  Right  Plenty of time 
[01:00:00]  To stop though  Yeah  Wouldn't have been a problem  No  But it was going down slow  And I had my timing right  All right  Did you have to  Go into the middle  Of the crossing  To get through it  Or else you might have  Hit the gate  As it's coming down  You know how the angle  Of the gate works  See it would be cool  If I said I had to  But no  No  No I stayed on my side  Of the road  The gate was coming down  I'm like I could easily  Make that  And I went through  All right  No big deal  That's very dangerous  Even to  Even if it's not down yet 
[01:00:30]  Right  When that starts  You never know  It could be a  Wacky signal or something  And you get creamed  Right  Well  I do it  And I see the cop pull out  Because he obviously  I mean  Obviously  People are doing this  You know  Day and night  So you know  They need someone right there  To catch everyone  Going through the railroad crossing  Oh boy  He was just sitting there  Waiting for someone  To do exactly what I did  Without a doubt  So he comes out of nowhere  It's always the cop's fault  We love the cops 
[01:01:00]  But it's always the cop's fault  When they pull you over  Of course  How is it the cop's fault?  Because I made it  I did good  Because I made it  I did good  The second those lights  Come on  He should have let me go  For the effort  The second the lights  Come on  Regardless of  If the gate's coming down  Or something  It might as well be  A red stoplight  You know what  I thought  I didn't know the rule  I swear to you  I just thought  You could take the chance  As long as  The gate's going down  Obviously you can't go 
[01:01:30]  Around when the gate's  Completely down  But I'm thinking  Fair game  Gate's going down  You still got time  To give it a shot  So I gave it a shot  I did fine  So he pulls out of nowhere  He was obviously  Waiting for someone  To do this  Because people are  Doing this all the time  All over the place  They gotta  Stop this  It's an epidemic  People doing this  Trying to beat  A railroad crossing  So the cop pulls out  And every time  I see a cop behind me  I go into panic mode  And Sandy always laughs at me  She's like  The cop's not pulling you over 
[01:02:00]  So once again  I see a cop behind me  I'm like  Getting pulled over  And she goes  Will you shut up  I'm sick of you saying that  Every time there's a cop behind us  I'm like  No  We are getting pulled over  Look how fast he's coming  You get the vibe  And they come up real close  Get right on the bumper  Before the lights come on  You know it  Right  I've pulled over  At times  Before they even  Turn the goddamn lights on  I know I did something wrong  They come up  Why bother  Don't waste the bulb  In your beacon there  I'll just pull right over  Right  So  So yeah  We get pulled over 
[01:02:30]  And I'm like  And now Sandy has to  Lecture me  And say  You know  Be nice  Because she knows  I'm like  Just a complete tool  Because I'm  Just an idiot  I know it though  Because I get so pissed  And frustrated  When I get pulled over  Yeah  So he goes  License and registration  Now I hate you today  By the way  Why  Because you're pulling  That PBA card crap  All the time  When you get pulled over  I only pulled out  A PBA card once  Usually I carry on  A little conversation  And somehow it gets out  That I'm on this program  If you remember  The past conversation 
[01:03:00]  Yeah the last time  There's people from this show  That they pull out  The PBA card  Wow you're from  The Opie and Anthony show  Works like a charm  Right  And what if I always said  In the past  I don't like pulling that move  Because I feel kind of  Embarrassed  Right  Feel a little dicky  About it  Right  Because maybe they're  Not a fan of the show  Do you remember  That conversation we've had  Yes I do  You have to look  And see if  They're in the demo  You know what I mean  Right  Well guess what  The cop that pulled me over  Not a fan of the show  No  So 
[01:03:30]  So he goes  License and registration  So I give that  And I go  What did you say  What did you do  I go  Will you accept  A PBA card  Will you accept  He keeps shaking his head  Will you accept  A PBA card  Well how else  Do you do it  Do you take  MasterCard  Or just cash  Right  Would you accept  A PBA card  Or Amex  I might as well  Have said  Will you accept  A hundred dollar bill  And we can all  Move on here  Would you accept it  Should I even bother 
[01:04:00]  Pulling it out  Now  Now that it's real  Awkward  That I ask you  If you accept it  Right  So he goes  So he goes  Yeah  He goes  I accept  PBA cards  Yeah  Nice  Now I swear to God  Except  Do you have a little  Chain thing in front of him  Like the ice cream man  Chain thing  So he can run it  Through his suite  And give you a copy  I'm just  I'm just pathetic  I cannot  I don't know  Here's your carbon  Right  I'm just a lawyer  So I go  I go 
[01:04:30]  Wow  Someone's saying  It's two points  Yeah  That's a bad one  Aw  It's points man  Aw  Because there's so many  Dopey kids  Like that  Freaking kids  That go around the gate  And get cleaned  Oh I gotta back up  Because they  Keith knows this  He goes  Do you know why  I'm pulling you over  Guess what my answer was  Why  I thought I made it  Wrong answer  I thought I made 
[01:05:00]  Oh  You did  Oh okay  Go ahead  I thought I made it  Here's your PBA card  Go back  You know  It's going down  And I thought I made it  That's what I told him  I thought I made it  I thought I made it  And then I said  Will you accept the PBA card  Because I remember  All the stories  Of everyone  Everyone associated  With the show  Getting out  With the PBA cards  He goes  Yes I would accept  A PBA card  And I'm like  Nice  How many cards  Have we gotten  Over the last year  Seriously  That was so formal 
[01:05:30]  I know  Will you accept  You just got  You guys just take it out  And go  Hey  Here you go  Seriously though  How many cards  Have we gotten  In the last year  Would you say  A hundred  Is pretty accurate  I would say a hundred  So I go to the guy  I got about a hundred  Of these things  Now  You got to update  First of all  You got to keep  One current one  In your wallet  I love it  And not  Not the one you had  All right  So I hand him  The specially made 
[01:06:00]  Opie and Anthony  PBA card  Oh Jesus  Wait  It's not even  From this year  I didn't say  What  Did you give it to me  Because I couldn't  Remember who gave it to me  No I didn't  It's a year old  All right  Well  Like the Abbott and Costello  PBA card  Instead of  You know  Saying who gave it to you  It has our names  It was specially made  By the fine folks  From the NYPD  Yeah  And he goes  I think that was  The hang up on the wall  In the office  Probably  You know  And on all the PBA cards  We've got  I'm like  This is the coolest one 
[01:06:30]  I'm assuming to have  In the wallet  I know your mindset here  You're thinking  All right  It's a PBA card  And it kind of opens up  How'd you get this  If they're a fan of the show  Right  I understand  So I hand him  I go  I go  It's an Opie and Anthony  PBA card  And now  And now I know  Why I don't do this crap  Because I always lose  He goes  He goes  And who are you  I'm Opie  He goes  Wow you're Opie  Oh now you're like  I'm sitting there good  Right  Yes 
[01:07:00]  So he goes  Well who gave you  The PBA card  I went  I don't know  Right  I don't know  We have a hundred of them  How am I going to remember  Billy Mac got those  Yeah  You got to know  I apologize to Billy Mac  But I didn't know  And he goes  Besides that  It's a PBA card  For the year 2000  It's 2001  He had to remind me  Of the year  Should have told him  Hey  Stinky told me  It was the year 2000  Right  I don't know  So then he goes  I'll be right back  And proceeds to write me up a ticket  Aww  I'm just 
[01:07:30]  Damn  I just look like  A complete idiot  I hate  I always hate  Pulling out the PBA cards  For this reason  Just in case  They're not a fan of the show  Or they don't give a crap  Yeah  Aww  So he comes back  With a ticket  That's soft  And then he said  Which really pisses me off  He goes  If I was you  I wouldn't show that PBA card  To anyone else  Aww  Aww  Aww  Aww  Aww  Damn 
[01:08:00]  That was it really  Now  This also was  Suffolk County  It was two miles  From my house  Big  Big difference  Between the NYPD  And Suffolk County  I know  You're living in Brooklyn  And the cops  I love the Brooklyn guys  I think I know half of them  Already  By now  The cops wave at you  And they pull up alongside you  Hey Anthony  One of the guys  One of the guys today  One of the guys today  I'm waiting outside of the apartment  Comes by  Whoop whoop 
[01:08:30]  He goes  You need a ride  No I'm cool  Whoop whoop  You know  It could have been two  Remember last year  We had that incident  Out in Suffolk County  Whatever  I'm just pissed at  You know  The cops two miles from my house  Wouldn't give me a break  Because I made it  I made it look good  Saral from Tenafly  I'm surprised  Opie could reach  The PDA card  With his T-Rex on  Billy Mac  What's going on  Well I'm glad to hear  That you made it  And you didn't get whacked  By some train  But I'm believing 
[01:09:00]  That that was probably  A Nassau County cop  And your 2001 card  Was on the way  Oh really  Nassau  Was it Nassau or Suffolk  No I think it was Suffolk  Well I don't know  Where you live  No it was Suffolk  It was Suffolk  But the card you got  Is for NYPD  Not for those squirrels  No and the sad part is  I do have some PVA cards  From Suffolk cops as well  We got them from everywhere  Nassau  Suffolk  Westchester  NYPD  I'm sure you do  But  The guy could care less  Exactly  They chase squirrels  And mules out there  That's about it 
[01:09:30]  It just pissed me off  That he was just sitting  Waiting for someone  To do exactly what I did  It's like  I must be an epidemic  People are doing this  All the time  I pull out a deck  And tell them  Pick one  I'm like Harry Blackstone  And then I flip the deck  The other way  And flip them  And they're all  The ten of diamonds  And then I actually  Take the current one  Out from behind  The officer's ear  It's amazing  That's the Psycho Mark  Approach  You pull the rubber band off  And you flail him out  The guy's face  What do you need? 
[01:10:00]  I got a hundred  I got one if we were  In Hawaii  Mike, what's up?  No, you can get out  Of this ticket  How?  On the back  There's a box  That says not guilty  And request a supporting  Deposition  What the officer has to do  Is write up  Fill out a form  This crap never works  It's worked for me  Go ahead, I'm sorry  They don't send you  The supporting deposition  And it gets thrown out  Or eventually  They're just going to  Schedule it  And you can pre-bargain down  I mean, that you can't  Get help with  But ask for a supporting 
[01:10:30]  Deposition  Because my father was a cop  It's just more paperwork  That they don't want to fill out  All right  Freud checking in  At least it didn't make you  And Sandy walk home naked  In West Summit County, man  You know what?  I've been on a really good  Streak lately, too  Yeah, you were getting  Speeding tickets every other week  In multiple states  And those are finally  Off your license  Yeah, I don't think  I have anything  We talked about this  In the past  When we were living up in Boston  This is no joke 
[01:11:00]  Within a little over  A month's period  I got four speeding tickets  In four different states  Yeah  Beat that  Bad  I got one in New York  Driving from Boston to Geneseo  Yeah  I got one in New Hampshire  Going skiing  One in Vermont  Going skiing  And one in Massachusetts  Going  What the hell was I doing?  A school zone  I was doing 55  In a 25  Oh!  See, there are  That's not a common sense thing  And that was the guy  Who said, you know what?  It was a Sunday morning  And he goes, you know what?  I'm supposed to arrest you  For going 20 
[01:11:30]  Yeah  With a speed limit  But, you know  A school zone  It's a major hassle  And I'm not going to do that  Wow  That's like something  But see, the school  You can't waste your school zone  Here's my philosophy on that  Sunday  School's not around  25 mile an hour  Don't mean nothing to me  It wasn't a Monday  Or a Tuesday  It was a Sunday  Everyone knows  No one's at school  On a Sunday  Sometimes it says  25 when flashing  And it stops flashing  On the weekends  Right  School zones are like hot spots  You've got to be enough  To speed through the school zone 
[01:12:00]  I'll be waiting there  I was thinking  Sunday  They're in crossings  I'm thinking Sunday  Sunday's about  A 35 mile an hour  I figure  You know  I can sneak a 50 in  Sneak a 50?  I went a little too fast  So 50  What was it?  About 55  Yeah  Wow  I'm more a highway speeder  You know what I mean?  I don't know  Back roads and stuff  I don't really like  Whizzing through those  Alright  Well, that's my  Cute little story  About being pulled over  Damn  Well, it's two points  On a license  So you better 
[01:12:30]  Mark  What's going on?  Hey guys  How's it going?  Alright  I took a honeymoon  Over at Pearl Harbor  Hawaii  It was all Japanese  It's like we lost the war  We lost the war  Oh, the Japs  Own everything in Pearl Harbor?

[01:13:00]  Listen  No  The thing is  Even at Pearl Harbor  They hadn't changed  The whole story  We had a trade embargo  Against them  And we bottlenecked them  Right  And they attacked us  To open up the shipping lanes  Yeah  Yeah, that's what they say  It was unreal  Alright, Mark  Thank you  Okay  Take care, guys  I was being polite to Mark  And now the guy  I really wanted to  Go to hung up  Who does Opie think he is?  Tony Soprano  With the PVA car  I know who I am  There was a cop on the line 
[01:13:30]  That said  The cop should let me go  And now I want to know  Why the cop would say that  But he hung up  Because I was being polite to Mark  Damn it  You should have offered him  Take the wife out for dinner  You know  Do something like that  He's going to go shop  And the poor guy  Is going to be working  Behind the counter  It was sad  Because when he goes  Hey  I'm sorry  He goes  You're Opie  I go  Yeah  I'm like  I'm a dick  I'm like  Yeah, I'm so in  Yeah  Look at that  Like Sandy  I'm like  I'm in  I'm in  All of a sudden  I'll be right back  Out

[01:18:30]  Right  Hey what's up  Hey you're the guys  Like that get fired  For saying the mayor died  Right  Yeah they're like  Funny dudes  Like where's Anthony  You're funny  Where's Anthony  Are you still doing radio  What happened  Hey dude  What happened  Hey  We forgot him  Tossing his beer bottle  Like way up in the air  Backstage  Remember  He was trying to  Smash his beer bottle  Because  Like we play  Your butt plug  Prank all the time  Still  Hey  Shut up  You're greeny  So you guys  Like in New York  Can we come by  And then I told them  How we have 
[01:19:00]  All of New York  Saying hey  You know  Cut it  Cut it out  You're going to  Green it  That's where you  Got it from  You're going to  Green it  You're going to  Green it  Anyway  Alright  What do we want  To move into here  We've got so much  To pick up  Yes  The body part  Thing is sick  That's a great story  The woman  That's a  The big fatty  The big fatty  Holy ass  Where do you want  To go  Well quick  Would I be dubbed  A homo 
[01:19:30]  If I said I watched  The making of  An NSYNC video  On MTV  Yeah  I think  I'd be dubbed  A homo  I just want to  Know where I stand  Yeah  I mean  Because you know  How MTV  Has the making of  I like  And they show  How they make a video  I like the making of  I saw the Britney Spears one  For which one  I don't know  Whatever  I don't like  I even know the song  I'm not even sure  It was NSYNC  Was it NSYNC  Yeah  The big  The big guy  Joey  The big fat guy  The hair face  Yeah  The fat guy  You just  Describe  A member 
[01:20:00]  Of every boy band  There's always  The fat guy  Well no  These guys are  Distinctive though  I think the guy  Though that  To who  To like  You're like  NSYNC fans  No to you Rick  You said he's distinctive  I think the guy  That Marco's in love with  Is in the stands  I'm just saying  No I want to  Take it  Calm down  Why is he distinctive  Because he's like  The fat guy  In the group  So yeah  He's distinctive  To that  But they all got that  Like I couldn't tell  I looked at all of them 
[01:20:30]  And said  It's the same lineup  You got the old guy  The fat guy  The blonde guy  The father guy  The one all the chicks  Want to bang  The one all the guys  Want to bang  How fat for a topper  All I know is  I think  One of the guys  In the band  Band  In that mess  Was the guy  That Marco's in love with  So it led me to believe  It was NSYNC  He's in love with JC  Oh  I think he's in love  Alright  Let's just say it is  Because I don't even care 
[01:21:00]  Yeah  And so I'm watching this  You know  See all the stuff  That goes into making  One of these videos  Of him  And the Joe guy  The big guy  He was practicing  Something with a trap door  And the trap door  Squished his leg  Kind of broke it  And cut it open  And stuff  So they're filming  This video the next day  And he can't dance  He can't dance  With the band  Oh no  What are they going to do  So what do you do  Do you put off  Making a video  They can't  Because on their CD  There was a sticker 
[01:21:30]  That said  On this date  Such and such a date  Which was listed  Look for the release  Of their video  So it had to be done  That day  So  They take the choreographer  Who's this skinny kid  They paint a beard  And mustache on the guy  And kind of make his hair  As much as they could  Look like  The big guy  The Joey guy  And he does all the moves  In the background  With the rest of the band  Like  They could just drop  The guy in 
[01:22:00]  And do the video  And you're watching  The video going  It's not him  It's not the guy  It doesn't even look like him  Like he's a skinny guy  I mean you think  It's like a real band  But you don't see them  Dropping Joe Perry in  To Aerosmith  And some guy in the background  Because Joe was off  On a drug binge  Years ago  Well they're  They're replaceable  We all know that  But  It just happened  At home  But you were saying  In the back office though  They would take shots  Of the real Joey  From like the chest up  The close up shots  Make him do all those  Head convulsion moves  And the shoulder twitches 
[01:22:30]  That they're doing  They're going to look like  He was the guy dancing  And then they go  For the far shot  And then they would be  The standing  And the standing guy  It was worse than watching  Because I also watched  On the sci-fi  I watched the Star Trek thing  They had a whole weekend  Of Star Trek  For the holiday weekend  And it was like  A William Shatner fight scene  A Captain Kirk fight scene  The up close thing  Where Kirk kind of  Slowly wipes  That trickle of blood  Coming out of the corner  Of his mouth  With his hand  I'm gonna kick your ass  And then the long shot  Is a totally different guy  Like  Wait a minute  Who's he fighting  I don't even know 
[01:23:00]  Who that is  That's what it was  But it just drove  The point home  That these guys are so  They could just be replaced  Like that  It's not like a real band  They want to come off  Like a real band  And yeah  I'm a faggot  Right  Okay  Fatty McPatty  Such a faggot  Let's go to Matt  Matt what's up  Hey what's up  It's Matt  The Kid donated  The NSYNC tickets  Yeah  When is the contest  Going to start  Well that's a good point  Because we've been  Kind of tied up  Trying to figure out  You know 
[01:23:30]  Where our careers  Are going  Yeah  We kind of forgot  About some of the things  We're supposed to do  On the radio  One of them is  Mommy what would you do  For NSYNC tickets  We gotta do it this week  Because the concert's  What this weekend  Six days  In six days  Yeah  We have a few  Mommies that were  Coming in to do  A couple things  Yeah what happened  I don't know  We gotta  Game on  We gotta  You know  Push this again  We need some  Mommies to  Give us a call  And tell us  What they would do  For the NSYNC tickets  For their kids  Yeah  It's a great contest  We do this from time to time

[01:24:30]  I don't think she agreed  To the sludge factory  No  But she would  Do the boob thing  Yeah definitely  Someone wrote that down  Somewhere  Probably  Alright well we gotta  Like get that going  Yeah game on  Damn  Earl's checking in again  To tell us  He's still at the sticker stop  Earl  Earl  Earl  Earl  Alright  Earl's doing a wow  Sticker stop today  At the Route 4 Auto Mall  Located at Dodge  Hyundai of Paramus  On Route 4 West  In Paramus  Says he's only going to be there 
[01:25:00]  Until 5  And he's calling to tell us  That he's going to be  Okay guys  I'm leaving  Right  I just wanted to tell you  Just want to let you know  I'm leaving now  Alright so  We gotta get the  NSYNC thing  Going  Big time  Yeah  Ladies come on  You want your daughter  To go see NSYNC  Don't you  Buy her love  Right here  Mario  Yes  Hey  Hey that stupid  NSYNC crap  Did you see when they  Had to give him a  Tetanus shot  Because he was afraid  He was going to get  Sick from the metal  Yeah they give him  A tetanus shot 
[01:25:30]  And he's on the phone  And he makes  His stupid face  They showed him  Getting a tetanus shot  Yeah  Right in his ass  You know all the girls  Were just  Oh oh show his ass  Please please  They did show some  Hot chicks  There were these  Oh they had to pick one  Yeah  They had to pick one  Real hot chick  That was kind of  Going to start this  Video off  And they had a bunch  Of extras  That were sitting around  And none of the  Except the Joe guy  None of the other  NSYNC guys  Even cohorting with the  New vile young 
[01:26:00]  Nymphos that were on the set  Well it's obvious  They're packed  Alright Mario  Thank you  Thanks  While we're talking  About quote bands  Yeah  I'm still reading  The Motley Crue  The Dirt book  Now that's a real band  We gotta get  Vince Neil back  On the phone  Because this book  I can't put it down  It's like 500 pages  I'm 300 pages into it  The stories just get  Sicker and crazier  As you go along  In this book 
[01:26:30]  I don't know  I don't know  When they had time  These guys were  Always effed up  There's a story  In the book  They were on  A tour of Japan  And Nikki Sixx  ODs on heroin  Right  In a drug dealer's  You know  Apartment or whatever  They thought he was dead  Is Steve around?  Because Steve  Could fill in the details here  They thought he was dead  So know what they did?  They're like  Wow  He's dead  But let's give it a try  They took a baseball bat  And beat the living crap  Out of him  While he was  You know 
[01:27:00]  Unconscious  Now who's actually  Beating him up like this?  Like the drug dealer  And I don't know  Whoever was hanging  Some of his friends  Or whatever  They took a baseball bat  I'm telling the  Nikki Sixx  OD story in Japan  They take a baseball bat  And beat the living crap  Out of him  Hoping to shock his system  Back to life  Right  Well that'll do it  You always see the best ERs  With like Louisville sluggers  Hanging on the wall  Just in case you  OD and your heart stops  Right  Well there's just nothing  Subtle about  Nikki's heroin addiction  At all  He just does heroin 
[01:27:30]  And injects things  Into his system  Whether it's booze  Or heroin  Or cocaine  Or whatever it was  Until he passes out  Right  He has to be revived  Right  So they tell the story  About him  Odin in Japan  They beat him up  With a baseball bat  To try to get him  Going again  And they tell the story  They were convinced  He was dead  So that one of the guys  Was carrying him  Over his shoulder  And they were going  To throw him  In a dumpster  Just heave him  In a dumpster  Heave him in a dumpster  In this back alley  In the middle of Japan  And I guess  I forgot what happened  But as he's over 
[01:28:00]  This guy's shoulders  They're walking him  To the dumpster  He started breathing  He started snapping  Out of it  But that's just one  I never think  That would be enough  To get you to stop  Doing heroin  When you OD  And your friends  Throw you away  A drug dealer  Throws you away  Because he doesn't  Want to get busted  For selling drugs  How close was that  To just reading a headline  Going oh my god  You know  A member of Motley Crue  Found dead in dumpster  Right  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  There's a million  Of these stories  In the book  I'm so surprised  No one died  The amazing thing  Is he's right 
[01:28:30]  There are tons of times  That this happened  And he never learned  He just overdosed  Yes he didn't have to  He still walked  Exactly  Hell  He had a party  Well when  Well he died  No he died  They tell the story  In the book  And we saw it  On Behind the Music  On VH1  Yeah  If you like the  Behind the Music  Motley Crue  Which I still think  Is the best one  They've done so far  The book takes it  To the next level  And they get more  In detail of what  Was going on  And things like that  But after he actually  Died and they got him  You know  He talks about how  He saw his body  On the gurney  He was above it 
[01:29:00]  Oh really  He tells the whole  All the details  Right  And then he  He like  When he came to  In the hospital  Or whatever  He undid all his  Tubes and stuff  And walked out  Of the hospital  He's like  Screw this  Went home  And did the biggest  Shot of heroin  Shot of heroin  He ever did in his life  And passed out again  Oh my god  And changed his message  On his machine  Because it was being  Reported before  People could find him  In the hospital  That he was dead  So he changed  His answer machine  Going hi  This is Nikki Six  And I'm not here 
[01:29:30]  Because I'm dead  And as he's doing  The shot of heroin  In the bathroom  After breaking out  Of the hospital  As he's like  Going into  La La Land  Again  He could hear  His answer machine  In the other room  Saying hi  I'm Nikki Six  And I'm not here  Because I'm dead  As he's passing out  Again on the  Bathroom floor  Wow  But they don't  Hold anything  Back in his book  No punches pulled  Whatsoever  I thought it was  Going to be  Another one of these  Fluff rock and roll  Dogs  Where they might  Hint that they  Slept with someone  Famous or something  Like that 
[01:30:00]  Screw that  They talk about how  Tommy Lee  Used to show them  All pictures of  Heather Locklear  Or was it Heather  It was Heather Locklear  He would  Heather Locklear  He'd bang her  Take pictures  And show everybody  Really?  Yeah  What are those?  I wish I knew  Wish I knew  But it really is  A great book  We gotta get Vince  Back on the show  To talk more about  Some of the things  In the book  Him and Nikki  Andrew  What's up guys?  Hey  Yeah man  Some of that stuff  In the book  Was a little  Unbelievable  About him 
[01:30:30]  Seeing himself  On the gurney  Remember the part  He's talking about  They're making a  Shout at the devil  Yeah  And he's saying  That there's  Forks and knives  Flying around  In his house  Yeah  I mean come on  Well it could have  Been the drug  Probably the drug  But he was getting  Into like black magic  And Satan  And all that  And all the members  Of the band  Or a bunch of them  Swear that they  Would go over  His house  It would be  A bad vibe  And they would  See things  Flying around  His freaking house  They all  Poked up  The unbelief  Right  Anyway there it goes  Alright man  How do you live 
[01:31:00]  Through that many  Like near death  Experiences  He probably made  A deal on his  First time out  You know  Like alright  I'm dead  But  Satan  You can have  My soul  Just put me back  A little longer  I'm having a  Really good time  So just put me back  And then when it's  Really done to  Catch it  And  Oh man  It's just a million  Stories  Okay I could use  A good band down here  A million stories  In this book  Wow  It's called The Dirt  It's a really good read  That would probably 
[01:31:30]  Be one of those  Band books  That you could  Really make a great  Movie out of  If they did it right  I think Gene Simmons  Is already called  For the movie  You know  He's another one  He's in the middle  Of writing a book  Like that  And someone like him  He fills it with  Double entendre  He's very subtle  About all the  Yeah  All the starlets  He's had sex with  These guys just  Put it right out there  I mean they probably  Made a lot of enemies  Everything from the  Porno tape that got  Released with Vince  Neal and Tommy Lee  You know what sucks though  Gene Simmons 
[01:32:00]  Thinking about putting it  Out as a movie  The guy is just  Going to look at  How much money  It could make  Right  If it's too offensive  It's not going to  Bring as many people  In as  You know  It should just be  Hardcore what it was  So you could really  Get a feel for it  In a movie  Instead of  The Gene Simmons  Well how are we  Going to get  A PG rating  Right  And get  The most people  That we can get  Into the theater  Right  Well just look at  All the people  That flocked to  Detroit Rock City 
[01:32:30]  Because it got  A R rating  And nobody  That's another reason  Gene Simmons  Should just go away  I saw him on  The encore presentation  Of who wants  To be a millionaire  It was terrible  What was it  I can't remember  The question he blew  But it was  It was really  An easy one  And he just like  Oh sorry  I screwed up  Mark what's up  What's up bro  Hey  Check it out  Maybe Nicky Six  Had a little credit  There for  Kickstar my heart  No that song  Is exactly  About him 
[01:33:00]  Dying and coming back  Isn't that awesome man  Yeah  Those guys rock  Alright  You guys cleave  Bye  Let's go to Frank  1027 WNW  Frank what's up  Yeah I just want  To say like  Back in high school  The crew  It wasn't really cool  To kind of listen  To the crew  Because it was more  Like a chick band  And then  Just two summers ago  You know what  I gotta stop you there  I don't agree with that  A lot of chicks  Were into that band  But I mean  They were more into bands  Like Poison  And White Snake  And all that crap  But it was like

[01:41:30]  Fantastic  Freaking Linus  Over here  Yeah  It does sound like  More of a security issue  Than a warmth issue  No it's just  No  Whatever  Here come the calls  I'm just trying to understand it  Hope is a fag  Blah blah blah  Yeah  I don't know  I don't know if that fits in fag  Before the movie starts  He ties the little knots around it  And he runs up and down the aisles  Like he's Superman  Cake  Yeah  That's what I do Rick  Exactly what I do  I didn't say it's faggy  I'm just  Alright  No mommies calling yet 
[01:42:00]  Do we have the numbers  From the mommies  From last week  We should call them  And see if  You know  They're in  There's one  I don't even think  Is really good  What did she want to do  The banana split  Food thing  Yeah but  Hey  You know  We gotta start somewhere  Yeah  We have nothing at this point  We have the tart and feather girl  Oh  Oh that's right  I knew there was one  We were forgetting  When is she coming in  Tart and feather girl  We gotta call her  And send her up  Alright call her up  We need her tomorrow  Immediately 
[01:42:30]  We gotta split out of the A  We do  That was a separate girl  Alright  Well let's call those two  And get them on the air today  See if they're in  We gotta get them in here by tomorrow  Cause we're running out of days  For this week already  But I don't think  We're working Friday  Cause we're not gonna be  On the contract  Yeah I don't think  That's wise  They might take advantage  Of us Sophie  If we work without a net  As they call it  Anyway  I saw Shrek  Yeah  This is the point  I wanna make  If anyone else saw Shrek  Please help me out  And back me up on this 
[01:43:00]  Okay  Wearing blankies  Or just people  That saw it  Oh okay  Whatever  People that are  People that are  Freaking normal  And go to the movies  When like  Regular people go  Oh okay  By the way  I'm never on  What  Come on  You already said  No  What  Does it matter  It's just a pet peeve  There was like  We were literally  The only ones there  I think there were  Six other people  In the theater  For some reason  They had four people  Behind the candy counter  Yeah  And there was a couple  In front of us  One of them was 
[01:43:30]  You know  Helping out that couple  There was still three  The concession people  At movies before  The worst employees  Ever  And don't even bother  Calling or try to  Plead your case  I've been to enough  Movie theaters  And concession stands  Where your phone call  Is not gonna change  My opinion  The worst employees  Ever  Work at concession stands  At goddamn movie theaters  They are the slowest  Bunch  Of jerk offs  They can't get  Anything right  And it takes them  Forever  There's a line 
[01:44:00]  Of ten people  One person wants  A popcorn  On that big  Vat of soda  And they cannot  Get one order done  In less than  Five minutes  Thank you  Alright very good  So I saw the movie  Shrek  And they're  Giving the wrong message  It's a message movie  Wait a minute  They are sending out  The wrong message  To these  Little girls out there  Wow  Not like this show  Now the  They sent the right message  Out to the little girls  Well the movie was good  I thought 
[01:44:30]  This guy says it sucked  But I thought  It was good  And then  You know  The computer animation  Just amazing  They just keep  Taking it to the next level  Yeah remember when  Toy Story was like  The big  Look at what they're  Doing with computer animation  That's still pretty cool  Oh I know  Without a doubt  But now  They've gone to the next level  With the  Leaves them down  Yeah  So I don't even care  If you haven't seen Shrek  Whatever  But basically  They're trying to tell  The little girls out there  In my opinion  That Beauty Anthony  Yes  Is on the  Inside 
[01:45:00]  And not on the outside  Was that the lesson?  Without a doubt  It was  Sort of a timeless lesson  Though  In movie history  If you look at  Things like  I beg to differ  I think of Snow White  And the Seven Dwarfs  And Cinderella  Hot pieces of asses  Every girl wanted  To be Cinderella  And every guy  Wanted to bang Cinderella  When we were growing up  What about  What about  The  What was that  The swan thing  The ugly duckling  Ugly duckling  See  The ugly duckling  Showed that 
[01:45:30]  You'd be  Attractive on the inside  See the ugly duckling  Was ugly  But it was very personable  Basically  And then it turned into  A beautiful swan  At the end  Well there you go  Yeah  Became a beautiful swan  In the end  Right  Because that's what  No whatever  Okay  So in Shrek  Guess what happens  In the end of this movie  What  The hot  Princess chick  Yeah  Becomes a big fat  Slob  Ogre  But it's okay  Because beauty's on the inside  Not on the outside 
[01:46:00]  Ah it's a croc of ass  Who the hell's gonna buy  That life lesson  It's a life lesson  Yes  We all look at  Attractive people  And go wow  She's hot  Whatever  I'm talking to the ladies  See it  Don't even say it  But you know  It'll be isolated  I hear it's against you  Forever  But the ladies do the same thing  As what I want to try to say  Okay  Yeah  And then after that  You hope that they have  Some substance  You know  To them  After you look at  Their hotness  From the outside 
[01:46:30]  Okay  And then you hope  They got something inside  Yeah  But this movie's basically  Saying to the little girls  It's okay to be a fat little slob  Ogre creature  As long as you're nice  Because you will have  Your own prince  I think it's lesson was  Stay with your own kind  Don't dilute the races  Stay with your own kind  If you're an ogre  You stay with an ogre  Goddamn ogre  Frank  What's going on?  Hey  I saw it the other day 
[01:47:00]  I took the kids there  I thought it was a pretty cool movie  Okay  The part you missed  Remember when she said  They were saying  That your true love  Will be when you get kissed  Right  So really  That's why she stayed  Like an ogre  And she didn't turn back  To the hot looking girl  In the beginning of the movie  Because it was okay  Because the ogre  Didn't mind a fat  Stumpy slob  As his love interest  Well yeah  But still  But the thing was  Stupid 
[01:47:30]  It doesn't work in real life  I don't buy it  Well of course not  I think what I'm trying to say  Is that you know  The political correctness  Policers are starting  To mess with our movies  And trying to give us  These lessons  That are just  Not feasible in real life  Yeah but think about it  You think a 12 year old girl  Is going to look at that movie  No  That's a movie for like  A 6, 7, 8 year old  Who still doesn't understand  That anyway  Don't be sorry  It's a lot  What? 
[01:48:00]  I'm in his blankie  No I  I bet  He's for a 6, 7, 8 year old kid  It wasn't even  You were taking a kid with you  Well listen  Well you know  Opie is  A child  In the mind  Thank you Frank  You're welcome Opie  Alright  Let me go to Mike  Who's next time  1027 WNAW  Mike what's up  Hey what's up  Hey  Eddie Murphy is not funny  Unless he's cursing  He was so bad in that movie  And on all the trailers  Said he was a comedic genius  He was terrible  I thought he had a few good lines  A few good lines  I'm not the biggest 
[01:48:30]  Eddie Murphy fan these days  But I thought he did okay  He did okay  Didn't Shrek sound like  Fat Bastard  Yeah  A lot of people said that  I think the funniest part  Of that movie  Is when he blew up the frog  Yeah  He used it as a balloon  But what do you think  Of this lesson  Where the hot  You know  Hot princess chick  Becomes a fat  Stubby ogre  It was terrible  And it's okay  Because beauty's on the inside  Not on the outside  And listen  And this is her  This is her true self  And it's okay  It's okay kids  Turned into an ogre  The movie had nothing 
[01:49:00]  My kid loved it  Because he liked  All the pretty colors  Alright  But I don't think  There was anything there  Alright thank you  Alright take care  Bye  God damn  You get an ogre  They should stay  With an ogre  I want my fairy tales  To end  Where the prince  Is banging  The hot piece of ass  Not a stumpy  You know  Little sausage  Finger ogre  Because it's okay 
[01:49:30]  Fairy tales  Don't mess with my fairy tales  Life lesson  The hot chick  Just banged  Turned into the  Freaking stubby ogre  I am pleased  See because in the old ones  The ogre would have  Turned into like a prince  Right  And they would have  Run off very attractive  And very happy  Well happily ever after  Like all the old  Fairy tales  Well see  What I thought 
[01:50:00]  What was going to happen  In this movie Anthony  And they went  You know  And they obviously  Went the other way  The ogre  Shrek  Yeah  Ugly piece of crap  Right  Kisses the princess  I'm thinking  Oh he's going to  Turn into a prince  Right  That's how it usually went  And they'll live  Happily ever after  Oh no  Not in this case  Oh no  You lose the hot  Piece of ass  And you wake up  Next to like  Green Aunt Jemima  Green Aunt Jemima  Tony what's going on 
[01:50:30]  Hey how you doing guys  Hey man  Alright  Hey  I wanted to know  I wanted to know  If you guys talked about  The guy that's going to  Donate or sell  His testes  For a sex change operation  Yeah  Tony we were talking  About this in the office  And we're trying to figure  You know  Where this guy's going  To sell his testes  Where do you  There's no market  For testicles  Maybe they can cook up  Something down in the village  And use that for something  What do you think  Well  All seriousness 
[01:51:00]  There's no  I don't know  If they could use  Testes  To transplant  You can't do that  No  Once they hit the air  They're useless  Right  I think so  Yeah  How does the story go  Well this guy  Gerald  DeRoset  Opie  Who now goes by  The name of  Sherry  Leanne  DeRoset  How's that for a  Topper  Says he spent  56 years  As a woman  Trapped in a man's body  If you're 56 
[01:51:30]  Why bother  How are they going  To reroute the plumbing  If you're like 20 years old  And you're a gay guy  Or something  And you're doing this whole  Woman trap  And a man's body  Shmear  I would think  If you're in that situation  Yeah  I don't want to like  You know  Put myself in a bad position  Again today  But I'm thinking  If you're in that situation  Yeah  Wouldn't you want to be  A hot piece of ass chick  And not like an old  An old tranny  An old  Like 
[01:52:00]  Yeah  Like you're talking about  Now  You want to go through  Life being accepted  As a woman  Right  So you go through  This whole operation  Very painstaking  And even if it goes  Very well  And you look like a woman  You're going to look  Like an old woman  Because the guy  Waited too long  Right  Until he was 56  Why bother that point  That's what I'm saying  If you're going to go  In that direction  Wouldn't you want to  You know  Try to be a young  Hot piece of ass  Right  You want some  Young man meat  Instead you look  Instead you  You know 
[01:52:30]  You wake up  Looking like  Aunt your mama  Looking like  An old woman  Well now he's  Offering his testicles  Nothing worse  Than an old woman  He's offering  His testicles  For cash  To escape the  Trappings of  What he calls  His tortured  Sexuality  Says I'm not  A greedy person  I'm just trying  To cover the cost  Of the operation  His sex organs  Could help  Doctors  Who are now  Using tissue  From animal  Testes  To treat brain  Diseases like  Alzheimer's 
[01:53:00]  And Parkinson's  They're using  Testy tissue  From animals  For Alzheimer's  And Parkinson's  Well they want to  Make sure the  Alzheimer's  Patients aren't  Faking  They put the  Testes in their  In their mouth  And if you're  Faking the Alzheimer's  You're going to  Wake the F up  Really quick  Now these are  Testes  You're going to  Put these in your  Mouth  And you have  Alzheimer's  So once we  Take them away  You're not even  Going to remember  They were in there  Okay forget it  Stop it 
[01:53:30]  I just did this  To get the  Wife off my back  Okay I'm fine  I remember everything  I was in the  Navy in 1940  Okay  Best friend's name  With Pete  We used to  Bang whores  In Sicily  I'm fine  I'll go home  Thank you for  Nothing  Screw off  Just don't put  Testes in my  Mouth  And for Parkinson's  I guess they  Put it in your  Mouth  And if you  Could hold  Them in there  Without shaking  Them out  They know  You're really  Far gone  You better not  Be dumping
