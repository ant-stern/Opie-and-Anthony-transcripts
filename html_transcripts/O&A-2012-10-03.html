<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about their Facebook page being hacked and filled with disturbing photos, prompting a temporary shutdown—a humorous anecdote for the hosts.  This led to a discussion of past radio shows they’d mocked, including a specific instance where their commentary caused a rift between a couple.  They mentioned their "Fun Fridays" segment, revisiting these past shows. Tom Papa was in the studio (Amy Schumer was present earlier but left for boxing), and they discussed her upcoming shows and a future show featuring her, David Tell, and Artie Lange.

The show then heavily criticized David Blaine's latest Tesla coil stunt, dismissing it as a rehashed, safe trick. Sam, who filmed the stunt, showed a video clip, further fueling the mockery. This was followed by a sarcastic interview with David Blaine himself.

Next, the hosts moved onto a local news reporter's (unnamed) reaction to an email criticizing her weight. They played a video of her response, where she framed the criticism as bullying. Opie, Anthony, and the other hosts (including Jimmy and Chip) heavily criticized her response, arguing the email, while insensitive, wasn’t bullying and that she was overly sensitive.  Derogatory jokes about her weight were made repeatedly throughout this segment.  This discussion continued later in the show with Jim Norton in studio, who joined in the fat-shaming, using terms like "fat news lady," and analyzing her perceived victimhood.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to humorous 911 calls.  Audio from "Superhero Jimmy," who repeatedly called 911 about a supposedly stolen bus, was played to great amusement. Pat, the listener who submitted the audio, was briefly interviewed.  Jim Norton's own 911 call about a potentially stolen bus, which spanned eight minutes and showcased his frustration with the operator, was also played and heavily commented on by the hosts and Tom Papa.

The recurring "Jocktober" segment featured a critique of "The Stan, Heidi, and Joe Show" on 107.5 Frank FM in Maine.  Clips of their show were played and analyzed with significant mockery, including sexually explicit jokes and crude commentary.  Tom Papa and Amy Schumer were guests during this segment.  The hosts repeatedly used the phrase "Heidi, the hole" as a running joke.  They also discussed the Maine show's Facebook page being overrun with aggressive and offensive comments, eventually leading to its deletion, and analyzed segments focusing on memory tips with further sexually explicit humor.  A side conversation involved a host's bad experience with ticket connections for a Pearl Jam concert and Yankee games.

The show included various tangents—crude and offensive jokes, speculation about the Maine hosts' personal lives, celebrity impressions, and recollections of past confrontations with their station management. Norton also discussed his recent encounters with celebrities, including Coach K, and there was a discussion on the upcoming presidential debate and the historical significance of Christopher Columbus, treated with varying degrees of seriousness and humor. The show concluded with plugs for upcoming appearances by Tom Papa and Amy Schumer.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Ah, yeah.  Ah, why don't we do that?  Hump Day!  It is what they call Hump Day.  The middle of the week, the hump.  Yep.  Down the back side of it, sliding toward the weekend.  Oh, boy.  And a big hearty, hearty heart to you.  Yeah.  Huck!  Oh, Wayne.  What is Jimmy doing?  I just tested my new camera. 
[00:00:30]  He's got a new camera.  You get a new camera every week.  No, I haven't.  The last one I got was that one I've been carrying in that big case probably two years ago.  They're very, you know, two years for cameras.  It's a world.  It's a world.  This is smaller, and it's easier to...  The other one was just too bulky.  It was like...  So this one's a little bit easier to carry in my pocket if I have to.  It's got one of them boner lenses on it, huh?  Yeah.  The lens comes out like a boner.  It's a Sony.  It's good.  Wait, what?  Yeah.  It kind of looks like a good camera one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:01:00]  It is.  It's a good camera.  It's 20 megapixels.  Really?  Megapixels.  What else about it?  Well, it's very easy to operate.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Oh, my God.  Everything on is pretty simple.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't know what this one is.  I don't care.  He doesn't care.  I don't care.  I'm getting this really weird flash.  I lost interest.  Were you fighting crime last night, Jimmy?  I was not.  No crime fighting?  No, I did take a quick ride around, a quick safety inspection of the city. 
[00:01:30]  God, I'm so annoyed by David Blaine.  Oh, yeah.  The guy pops up every, what, two years at this point, maybe?  It's like four years.  Every four years.  I couldn't help myself.  I tweeted him personally yesterday, and then the guy just follows me.  I don't want you following me.  I basically told him on Twitter yesterday, why are you continuing to do these lame stunts  that morning zoo radio shows have been doing for years?  Yeah.  We even did this dumb fucking stunt he's doing.  Did you not see this video? 
[00:02:00]  I haven't seen your video yet.  I know you went down there.  He's shooting lightning.  No, he's not shooting lightning.  It's incredible.  Do you remember at NEW, we had that girl come in.  It was a throwaway bit, Ant.  We did it for fucking ten minutes.  Yeah.  She came in, and she electrified herself.  Yeah, a Tesla coil thing.  Tesla coil.  She had the electricity shooting through her.  I think her hair fucking went nuts.  And it's a completely safe stunt.  We were bored with it within a couple minutes.  Like, oh, that was cool.  But all right, anyway, we got to fucking move on with our show. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  He's doing that for three days.  This guy's magic.  No.  And the media is like, oh, my God, David Blaine with another electrifying stunt here in New York City, blah, blah, blah.  It's nothing.  Only one person.  I've been reading a bunch of stuff on this.  Only one person called him out and said it's completely safe, and the only thing he has to do is stand there for three days.  That's the stunt.  That's the stunt.  The stunt is stand around for three days and make it look like you got, you know, this electricity that could, you know, electrocute you. 
[00:03:00]  It's so annoying.  It's so annoying because there's nothing to it.  You don't understand the hidden dangers.  You were not at the press conference yesterday.  What do you say at the press conference?  Well, see, the helmet he's wearing has like, it's not like a knight's helmet.  Can I tell you about the helmet?  Because I know what you're going to say.  Sure.  The helmet is to protect him further because the only thing that could happen to this guy is if he takes his finger and touches his face, he could fuck up his face a little bit. 
[00:03:30]  It wouldn't kill him, I don't think, but it would burn and whatever, leave something.  So he realized, well, I can't take any chances whatsoever.  So he put like this birdcage around his head, right?  So now he can't touch his face.  So it makes it even safer.  Well, theoretically, because he's wearing a chainmail suit, like he's wearing a full pants, shirt, gloves, everything.  But the caged helmet is big enough to stick a finger in. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, my God.  So he said after three days of no sleep, you start to hallucinate, at which point maybe he forgets and scratches his cheek.  You think he's going to tease that a little bit?  Like he's going to start reaching toward his face all confused and go, oh, wait, oh, yeah, that's right.  I can't touch my face.  And then everyone goes, David, no, David, no, David.  No, I can't touch it.  Oh, thanks, guys.  I'm hallucinating from standing for three days. 
[00:04:30]  He's counting on the people to interact with.  Where are these guys, the real guys that used to amaze us, the Harry Houdinis?  And I hate doing that, by the way.  I don't know why I'm doing it.  I don't like pluralizing people.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I hate when people do that.  But, you know, the Opie's, the Anthony's, the Jimmy's, the Jimmy's, the Chipster's, the Opster's.  We're the real guys because this is so weird.  He's got a birdcage on his head.  That's stupid.  He has good endurance.  That's what he should be getting ready for.  You love birds.  He's in good shape.  He's in good shape. 
[00:05:00]  But if you were going to get all the attention he's going to get in the next three days, you would be able to stand around for three days and not sleep.  Like, he's got a great PR department because, you know, he comes to the city once every two years with these dumb stunts that so many people have done, and they all just eat it up.  You're going to see nothing but a shitload of coverage on this.  It's nonsense.  It's really a dumb trick that if you searched Mr. Wizard Tesla coil, you'd see Mr. Wizard did this with nary a problem. 
[00:05:30]  Actually, he had kids do it on his show.  Right.  Sure.  Sure they do.  Remember when he was frozen in that block of ice?  Yeah.  That was a company, when I was first starting out on radio, they went around the country getting morning shows to do that very same bit.  Right.  Because you're not even cold inside the block of ice because your own body heat is keeping you nice and warm.  The key to that trick is make sure your skin doesn't touch the ice so there's enough room within the block.  Morning shows did that bit all over the fucking country. 
[00:06:00]  And then the Buried Alive, they did the exact same bit.  A whole bunch of morning shows.  Okay.  Me and Vosch button saw him when he was buried alive.  It was right behind where we live.  He was just in a glass box, right, that you could look into?  Yeah.  You looked down into the ground.  So he wasn't even buried.  No, he's just claustrophobic.  How they used to do it in the old days, they actually buried you.  And then they had like a closed circuit TV, you know, so you could see what's going on.  And people would, it would be at a car dealership or something dumb like that. 
[00:06:30]  And then listeners would come by like, well, there's the morning show.  They're buried alive.  Oh, my God.  When are they getting out?  This is crazy.  And he's doing...  Upside down.  Huh?  What about his upside down?  We've all been upside down.  What was that?  That one, that one was so lame that even morning zoos didn't do that one.  Because they knew that was just ridiculous.  Well, I mean, aside from getting put up right side up every like few hours.  Remember?  Because we called them out on that one too.  We're the only show that calls them out on it.  You went down there and called them out.  Like, why are you not staying upside down if that's supposed to be the stunt? 
[00:07:00]  Oh, right.  Remember they had him right side him up?  How would you say that?  I don't know.  Uppend him.  Uppend him.  Uppend him so he would get his blood flowing the right way for a little while.  And then he would go back and be upside down again.  Yeah, there was a cherry picker next to him the whole time.  So like every maybe two hours, he got pulled up from hanging upside down.  And he got to stand up for a couple minutes.  So can we play the video or this disc?  You went down there. 
[00:07:30]  That's the interview.  This is just the amazing, death-defying stunt.  Yeah, let me see how amazing this is.  Okay.  Look how amazing this is.  Is this your video, Sam?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It'll be up on our Facebook page and all that?  Yeah, look up David Blaine shooting lightning.  All right, let's...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Standing on a platform.  Be careful.  Look how careful he's getting up there.  Look at all the photographers.  They told all of us press that we had to stay very far back. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, really?  Stay back.  Stay back.  Three, two, one.  Oh, my God.  He thumbs up and he's okay.  Thank God.  He's scared.  You're fucking magic, this guy.  You're scared for him?  Yes, I am.  Fucking lightning or something.  That poor Chip, he gets scared.  They just stop it and no one gives a fuck. 
[00:08:30]  He is plum out of ideas.  Yeah.  He's just out of ideas.  Oh.  Cutting a gasser.  We're just seeing, like, electricity going from his hands and his head.  They're cranking the Tesla.  It's like a weed lacquer.  Yeah.  But it's completely safe.  It's literally a mystery.  He's going to stand there, like, just for three days to that noise? 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  He's got ear things going, though.  Oh, he does?  Yeah.  Because otherwise it's loud.  Another guy that is extremely famous for just lame-ass shit.  Lame-ass shit.  You know what the worst part of this video is?  Huh?  Not Sam's logo.  It's in Reagan.  It's in the bottom corner.  Where it looks like one of those things that fly in during true TV shows.  Yeah.  Where fucking, you know, they'll show, like, the NASCAR storage walker guys.  Because it looks like a cartoon Sam is in the audience. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  No.  I'm enjoying the show.  It's a shitty gray font that blends right into the background.  It's terrible.  Yeah.  Not Sam.  I wish that's who was sitting next to me.  Let me ask you.  It's not going to be electrocuted for three days, either, is it?  No.  Of course not.  It's going to be like, all right, I guess we're going to turn electricity on for a while.  No.  The way it works is, it's like electricity is surrounding you.  That was one of his people, by the way, that probably started that applause.  Oh, yeah.  Of course. 
[00:10:00]  They actually, somebody asked that, and he said, no, it's not technically him having electricity  running through him for the three days.  It's around him.  The way he was surrounded by ice.  The energy is there around him the entire time.  Right.  So the electricity, they're actually going to have a giant electricity show around him.  Oh, good.  It's a bloody taboo.  Look, I was a big fan of his with that street magic and all that. 
[00:10:30]  It was amazing.  He had a couple of those specials.  I was blown away by some of the stuff he was doing.  But then he went into this area where it's like, dude, what the fuck, man?  Just terrible.  He doesn't sleep that much, though.  You got to give him that.  There's Jimmy, who gives a shit.  Oh.  What?  Here's the big interview with...  You don't sleep.  That's right.  Here's the big interview with David Blaine.  Sam went down there yesterday.  We're here electrified with David Blaine.  Fake.  Fake.  Fake.  What's happening?  You tell me.  The last time I saw you, I was upside down. 
[00:11:00]  See, he remembers you, huh?  Oh, shit.  It was funny, because before we started talking, he remembered me.  And he said, yeah, let me...  He was trying to remember.  He was like, you asked me a funny question last time, right?  Uh-oh.  I said, I don't remember.  Probably not.  What was your question again?  I don't remember.  He remembers you.  You don't remember what he asked him.  Cool.  The question that I couldn't remind him of was, why do they call you the mind freak?  Ooh.  And I was like, I'm not going to remind him that...  Right.  You're not going to remind him that you asked him.  Fucked around like that.  That's funny. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, jeez.  Well, the last time I saw you, I was upside down.  Right, right, right.  And you complimented my hair that day.  And I still compliment it.  Thank you so much.  It's nothing compared to what you're about to do.  You're going to be electrified for days.  How do you prepare for something like this?  I stopped eating a week and a half ago because obviously there's nowhere to get rid of solids.  So I've prepared that way.  I've dropped about 45 pounds.  So I have less weight because this weighs 27 pounds.  So 27 pounds over the course of three days becomes a bit of a difficulty. 
[00:12:00]  Stop.  He's just making shit up.  It's so annoying.  And by the way, I just checked my Twitter.  YouTube high wire workers.  People do this shit for a living.  I know.  What?  He's mocking people that do this for a living.  They get no credit.  And this fucking guy is going to get so much credit.  Oh, man.  A lot of adulations.  Those guys step out of helicopters.  Remember?  Onto those fucking high tension wires.  And just practice in the environment.  You do a lot of, I don't know if you, stunts. 
[00:12:30]  I don't want to call them illusions because they're actually something that's happening.  Was stunts the word?  Very good.  Yeah.  You do a lot of them that they last days.  You end up very hungry, very tired.  What do you think about, like, for your next stunt doing something that takes, like, three  to four hours, and then you get the afternoon?  I have that one in store, but I don't know how to get ready for that one.  It's a tricky one.  I have that one.  On my poster, I have a decade poster. 
[00:13:00]  If you go on my website and look at it, and just look at the bottom left corner, Tesla's  one of the people there, but there's four other people, and those are the four other things  that I want to do.  So one of them is what you're talking about.  How much experience have you had with electricity?  Like, have you tried, like, sticking for it?  Did you challenge him?  Please tell me you challenged him.  This is a pretty good interview so far.  I like it.  Did you tell him how lame this is?  Yeah, with electricity.  I would look him right in the eye and go, this is so fucking lame.  Turn off lights. 
[00:13:30]  Because you're combative.  I ask goofy questions.  Oh, he's what?  Oh, he's what?  Combative.  Oh, boy.  At times.  Yeah, it's a little extra.  Why do you make words longer?  The extra it?  Yeah.  Combative.  Combative.  I like combative.  Combative.  You can say combative, I think.  If you're an asshole, you can.  Combative.  Have you tried, like, sticking forks in the toasters?  No, what I have at home is this shocking system that I've been playing with.  And you get zapped.  You take it.  You feel it. 
[00:14:00]  And you just get used to it.  You get used to it.  But that's worst case scenario.  The suit is supposed to protect me.  So unless it does what it did.  It's not supposed to.  You already know it does.  I hate this.  Of course it will.  You can't even hear his energy.  He's not up for this.  This guy's magic.  You don't understand.  He could be killed.  I fucking love this guy.  Why is he doing this?  He's going to get shocked to death or something.  Chip is a huge fan of doing this.  My mother would always say, Chip, I don't put nothing in the toaster.  Oh, boy.  Fuck, a guy's got electricity.  He's like God or something. 
[00:14:30]  No, he's not.  Yes, he is.  It's coming out of his fucking hands, cocksucker.  I've seen it.  I think you might be right, Chip.  Fuck, yeah.  Poor Chip.  He's so frightened of this whole thing.  I'm worried about David Blaney.  After two days, he's going to fall or something to itch himself.  Chip is like a black person when he sees magic and gets freaked out.  Don't they get so scared?  Of course.  African-Americans, very scared of magic.  Yep.  They go like, ah, shit!  They run away.  They run away from the magic. 
[00:15:00]  They're the best audiences, right?  Oh, yeah, please.  What about the time he was in a glass box?  And people, that was in London, right?  Yeah.  People in London said, fuck you.  They started throwing like eggs and everything at him.  Yeah.  They were muscing up his glass box.  Yeah, because after a while, they're like, wait, you're just in a glass box.  There's nothing going on here.  I watched a documentary, and he was talking about how jarring it was, having the loud sounds  of things smashing against this box that people were throwing.  What could we do to this idiot down there at the pier? 
[00:15:30]  A pier with a super soaker.  You know what I was thinking about is that if they said for the first time, he'll have  like a, I guess a laptop or something up there with him.  Oh, really?  Yeah, because he's going to, he said.  Because he's bored.  He said he'll be able to interact with the audience, and for the first time, because  Intel is like doing it with him, like they're sponsoring it.  Yeah.  And they're trying to sell this dumb.  You've got a sponsorship.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they're trying to sell this laptop.  And so they're streaming it live, and people can interact with him on the internet, and  Doesn't fuck up the laptop? 
[00:16:00]  I would think so.  The electricity around him?  But I would also think with all the internet trolls.  Yeah.  I don't know if all the commentary on the internet will be positive.  Oh my God, probably not.  Stop doing this dumb shit.  Probably not.  Here, we're, you know.  Yeah, it's open.  Yeah, we're going to fix that.  That's not encouraging.  No, that wouldn't be a good thing, because once it goes in, it's a nightmare.  Yeah.  Are you worried that, for it was ice, it was water, now it's electricity, that you're  going to run out of places to be hungry and tired in? 
[00:16:30]  This is the most ambitious thing, I think, of all.  I don't think I can ever top this thing.  Stop it.  I think this is pushing to the limit for me.  I think it is, too.  Before we let you go, you have to tell me, do you think that Chris Angel feels like a  little kid with a magic set when he sees you doing amazing things like this?  No, I think he's a hard worker.  I don't really follow that much, but...  Oh.  Well, this is incredible.  Congratulations on pulling it off, if you do.  Thank you very much. 
[00:17:00]  I'll see you afterwards.  Fucking Chris Angel, don't let electricity shock him like this.  No, shit.  This guy's fucking magic.  It's not magic.  It's simple science.  I don't know.  I mean, I actually...  Simple science.  I usually don't agree with Chip, but this time...  Yeah.  This time, I kind of do.  He's like Zeus or something up there.  Have some lightning bolts, motherfuckers.  Oh, yeah.  You know what else was electrifying?  That interview.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  It was pretty amazing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank God there's some sarcasm in there, at least.  Just a tiny bit sprinkled in.  Yeah. 
[00:17:30]  It's a big drop-off from the big hit video, though.  Yeah.  Everything.  You've got to live up to that.  Good luck.  There is no other rate.  This is like...  That's like me saying, like, you know, you have to live up to the Windows video.  It doesn't...  You know, we do what we do, Anthony.  We do what we do.  We do what we do, don't we?  That is true.  Don't we?  But in fairness, this is very tough.  What do you think of David Blaine, Jimmy?  I have mixed feelings about David Blaine.  Really?  I met him the night I met Edward Norton at the Comedy Cellar.  I'm sure he's a nice guy.  He was such a nice guy. 
[00:18:00]  I don't think...  I think you're right.  The street magic stuff was interesting, and he was very good at that.  But this stuff really is kind of lame.  It's like, who cares about...  This is basic shit that's been done a lot, and no one else has gotten credit for doing  it.  And for some reason, because he's like, what, a rock star?  Looks like a rock star.  He's got a good PR firm.  No, the PR firm is it.  His publicist or whatever, his PR is great.  He's able to get major attention for stuff that's been around forever that has been done  a million fucking times.  Not for three days.  He was in a glass box just hanging out.  Who would allow that?  If any of us went to Mayor Bloomberg and said, hey, I want to just hang out in a glass box 
[00:18:30]  above a bridge for three days, they wouldn't let us do it.  He said this is the longest possible time that he could stay standing.  He will be standing, no rest, no sleep, no food, for 73 hours.  He said any more than that, it's impossible.  Wait, hold on.  What?  Sorry, I dozed.  I dozed off during that.  73 hours, huh?  73 hours.  I bet you a few of our soldiers have fucking stood for three straight hours, three straight 
[00:19:00]  days.  My God, man.  With electricity shooting out of their head?  No, with fucking bullets flying all around them.  Yeah, how about that?  And they're not going to get any fucking credit.  Oh my God, man.  I don't know why this annoys me.  I don't know.  And he said...  I don't know.  This is ridiculous.  At the press conference, in his pants, the chainmail kind of busted a little bit.  Uh-oh.  And he said if that is to happen, the lightning bolts will strike his leg.  What about his pecker? 
[00:19:30]  I mean, if it ripped in that area, sure, it could strike his pecker, too.  But he has a kill switch and all that.  He probably has some kind of kill switch with him.  In his hand?  Probably.  There's an immediate kill switch.  But something that he could probably hit, too, if he had to.  Or there's a cut.  Probably something on the floor, maybe.  Or there's something that will just cut it.  Because I don't even know if you can move if you're getting electrocuted.  There's probably something that cuts it.  I think there's somebody on duty at all times ready to hit the kill switch.  He also said that he normally wouldn't have done this.  This is because he has a daughter now. 
[00:20:00]  But he will be clipped to the pole.  Because it's like 20 feet in the air.  So there is no risk of him falling off.  Oh, so there's not even a risk of him falling.  No risk of him falling.  It will not happen.  A lot of people that know this shit even more than us are saying he's using low amps, so nothing really could happen, even if something would go wrong.  But it's almost impossible that anything would go wrong.  He said one million volts, always on.  Yeah, but it's not really always on him. 
[00:20:30]  I mean, yeah, I guess one million volts would be the collective volts.  Like right now, millions of volts are on at power plants all over the country.  Right.  We're getting more electrocuted right now than he is.  Oh, it's right.  Like doing this radio show, yes.  Yes, yes.  Of course.  All right, so there you go.  David Blaine back in our dumb city doing a dumb stunt with everybody paying attention.  And he's shielding his eyes, too.  He's got that red thing to make sure.  Because imagine the light.  What?  Like what?  Cyclops?  No.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Actually, it does look a little like Cyclops. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  Cool.  You know, so I think it's going to be amazing.  I'm going to go down and check it out.  Well, you heard Chip is very amazed at it.  I can't believe this guy is not getting more accolades.  Yeah, you should get some accolades, huh?  You see the time he was underwater for all that time?  You should get accolades.  I watched the whole fucking thing.  Without the accol.  He should be at the debate in between the president just going, oh, fucking shooting electricity.  Talk about electrifying.  So you think David Blaine can just shoot lightning wherever he is? 
[00:21:30]  Fuck yeah, he's like zoots or something.  That he just goes places and just starts firing lightning out of his fingers.  Fuck yeah, man.  It's like Green Lantern or something.  I say we have Chip do a stunt for everybody.  What kind of stunt would you do, Chip, you think?  Fucking whatever.  I would just like lay in the water or something and throw lightning.  Would you rock out for like three days straight without sleeping?  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  While he's doing electricity, I just play guitar.  Yeah, fucking shock everybody.  And see who gets more attention.  I think you, probably. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  Maybe.  That is Blaine.  He followed you after you insulted him?  Yeah, I was fucking frustrated.  Why would he follow you?  That wasn't the opester.  That was Opie.  Yeah, that was.  I was just like, what the fuck are you doing?  You're doing another morning zoo radio stunt.  That was combative Opie.  And I said, what happened to your creativity?  Because the guy used to have some creative street magic.  He was different than other people that were doing his shit.  Do you think Criss Angel messed him up?  Because Chris is a really good street magic guy, too. 
[00:22:30]  I don't know what happened, but these are such lame-ass stunts.  Yeah.  I would imagine he would come up with something better, something a little more unique.  All right, I don't know if I made my dumb point.  It's electrifying.  He's going to be surrounded by electricity.  No, yeah, it's crazy.  Three days.  Three days.  73 hours.  Three days and one hour.  Yeah.  Did you, um, I'm sure we all got this sent to us through our Twitters.  Um, the fat news reporter. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, yeah.  I watched it finally this morning.  She, uh, I guess...  I don't really have much of a problem with her.  I don't.  Well, you know what?  She, um...  I think she should try to lose weight for her own fucking health.  I don't think the letter was as bullying as she made it out to be.  Right.  Oh, did she say bullying?  Honest, yes.  Well, October.  We picked the perfect month to do, uh, Jocktober because October is, uh, Bullying Awareness Month 
[00:23:30]  or something like that, or Anti-Bullying Month or whatever the fuck they call it.  You know, I agree there's bullies out there and stuff, but they're making just normal, everyday  things bullying now.  It's, especially, uh, like kids at school.  They, kids at school will argue, they'll fight, they'll make fun of each other.  It's not necessarily bullying.  I think bullying has to be repetitive.  I don't think if you have an argument with someone at school and either they, they just  call you a name or take a little pot shot at your, your fucking head, uh, it's not bullying. 
[00:24:00]  It's just the way kids fucking act at school.  It's the way you grow up.  It's just part of growing up.  But they, they, they were asking kids, you know, have you been bullied?  And 90% of all children say at some point they've been bullied.  So that means, so that means everyone's been bullied.  But it's not bullying.  90% to me means everyone.  Yeah.  That means those kids that don't fucking socialize at all and they're untouchable.  Yeah.  But it's not bullying.  But the rest of us, the masses, we've all been bullied.  It's just fucking, uh, life. 
[00:24:30]  It's not bullying.  If you actually say who's been bullied at school, I bet it's less than 10%.  Continues to this day.  I bully people on Twitter.  People bully me on Twitter.  It just continues, man.  Every insult is not an example of bullying.  Exactly.  Every insult, bullying, I think it is a consistent thing.  And it's when one, it's when there's a total domination by one over the other.  Yes.  If you have an argument with somebody and they're like kind of being addicted, it doesn't mean  they bullied you.  It's not a bullying episode.  If there's some fucking kid that's got some fucking one leg shorter than the other limping 
[00:25:00]  around school and all the kids goof on them, that's bullying.  Right.  And we all used to do that.  Of course we did.  Anything different, we made fun of.  Bullying's fun.  Um, so many people checking in.  I'm a lineman for a utility company.  This is perfectly safe.  I know.  Of course it is.  I'm talking for you guys today.  Is he a lineman for the county?  Is he a lineman for a living?  For a living roots?  Have any of them scratched their faces?  Like, got an itch on their cheek or something?  Well, that's true. 
[00:25:30]  If he has an itch, you can't fucking scratch it.  What if he has an itchy asshole and he burns his asshole and he's scratching it?  We're watching for three days hoping he scratches his face.  He has a little patch of stinky chain mail.  So this video went viral.  You got a fat news lady in Wisconsin.  She got an email.  And she responded to the guy on her show.  Whatever she does.  Do you know what she does on this news show?  Anyone know?  Bees fat.  Yeah.  She's the diet section. 
[00:26:00]  They just kind of show her.  And they put arrows up that she's just not aware of.  And they go, do you want to look like this?  Take care of yourselves.  And she's like a fucking large fat.  She's got big boobies, though.  But it's amazing how she's on a news show.  I wonder if she ever, if this is what she's concerned with,  did she ever, like, read the letter to one of her own constituents  who maybe went after the parents of a murdered kid at a bad time  and asked a stupid question?  I wonder if she ever objected to that, this fucking fat skunk. 
[00:26:30]  You want to play the video from there?  It's the same as what I got, basically, right?  Huh?  Yeah, I'll have to pull it up, though.  Yeah, yeah.  Why don't you pull it up?  Pull it up, Sam.  Jesus Christ.  Everyone's talking about this woman today.  We've got to wait for this video.  Jeez.  It's been a while, right?  It's been forever.  All right.  It's called...  Technology that's called Community Responsibility.  Oh, boy.  She way overreacts to this.  You think?  Yeah.  And I think she does. 
[00:27:00]  It's a letter that, you know, it might be a little inappropriate, the letter, but nothing  wrong with it.  You know what's funny about this?  She's fat.  And if you look right next to her hip, she's standing next to something that makes it look  like she's that much wider.  Oh, is that the back?  The table or something?  Yeah.  When I saw this on my phone, I'm like, wow, she is fucking fat.  Yeah.  Just because how she's standing on set.  Like, she should have had a, you know, a light background. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  She didn't do herself any favors.  No.  She's standing, like, next to her post or something that makes it look like it's part  of her body.  All right.  Hit that.  Take a moment to address a situation that has become a talking point in this community  over the past weekend, especially on Facebook, that centers around me.  Oh, boy.  On Friday, I received...  Uh-oh.  Oh, she didn't just do that.  Oh, no.  Oh, Facebook.  Oh, boy.  Look. 
[00:28:00]  I don't know where Facebook is or what the name of it is, but oh, boy, I don't think  she's going to be able to read any of those letters.  I don't know.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  There's a lot of insensitive people out there.  Oh, I know.  We don't encourage anyone to find that Facebook page.  Let me say this, and for the record, we do not condone any type of bullying on Facebook,  and I absolutely would tell people not to do anything to upset anybody. 
[00:28:30]  However, I would never say don't do it or do it.  I would just say...  Well, there is a freedom out there.  Do what you want to do.  I personally wouldn't do it.  I wouldn't.  And I admit that I would laugh if I read it.  I probably would.  I'm a creep, and I laugh at harsh shit.  Sorry.  I laugh on my own Twitter when people call me a fucking AIDS bag.  Oh, yes.  I think we got the message out.  Okay, good.  Oh, no.  How rambunctious this time of the year.  Oh, no.  So, she's cute, man.  But she's standing next to an eight this morning.  It should be a one next to her. 
[00:29:00]  She's not an eight.  Unless you're talking about Richter scale.  Uh-huh.  Although she looks like a squishy eight.  It's what she constantly did before the show.  Someone said, how did you wind up like this?  Oh, boy.  That's right.  We're making fat jokes, lady.  Now, we're only ten seconds into this.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  Following email from a lacrosse man with the subject line, community responsibility.  And it reads as follows.  Okay.  As follows.  Hi, Jennifer. 
[00:29:30]  It's unusual that I see your morning show, but I did so for a very short time today.  I was surprised, indeed, to witness that your physical condition hasn't improved for many years.  Surely you don't consider yourself a suitable example for this community's young people, girls in particular.  Obesity is one of the worst choices a person can make and one of the most dangerous habits to maintain.  I leave you this note hoping that you'll reconsider your responsibility as a local public personality to present and promote a healthy lifestyle. 
[00:30:00]  Okay.  Hold on.  She has to do this.  She had to read that.  That's great.  Now, anyone that would consider that bullying, and she absolutely, as far as I recall, watching the video last night, she does call this letter bullying.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, it's not.  It's actually, he's making a point.  All forms of criticism are not bullying.  Right.  If you're writing, hey, if you write, say, 50 in a row or 20 in a row, and you're like, hey, fatso, I'm going to come and kill you, then you're bullying somebody. 
[00:30:30]  That is not.  But we can't have it both ways, either, because we make fun of local news because all they do is hire, you know, beautiful people.  True.  And now you got this slob that probably does a good job with this local news program.  But we just want to see the beautiful people.  We do, right?  The beautiful people.  Yeah.  But I don't even know why they're hired, because they look good.  Sure.  Exactly.  They don't know what the fuck they're talking about.  Of course not.  And I don't mind her.  They're good readers, and they have nice tits. 
[00:31:00]  But her being on the news, I had no problem with it.  I don't care what she looks like.  And maybe this guy is kind of a dick for writing that, because what she looks like shouldn't matter.  But it's a legitimate point he's making, even if it's mean, and it's none of his business.  But it's not bullying.  I think she could lose a few pounds.  But out of debt, she could lose 50.  And I think it would be very easy for someone like her.  I think there's other people that it's a lot harder to lose weight.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've changed my opinion on the whole thing.  Look at Mike Baker.  What a handsome devil he is.  Leather jacket. 
[00:31:30]  He looks like Indiana Jones today.  I guess he's on Imus.  But yeah.  He's got his leather jacket on.  That guy is so killed people.  Oh, you know it.  He snaps on nicks.  But it says choices.  Now, those of us in the media, we get a healthy dose of critiques from our viewers throughout the year.  A healthy dose of pepperoni pizzas.  And we realize that it comes with having a job in the public eye.  But this email was more than that.  What was it?  While I tried my best to laugh off the very hurtful attack on my appearance, my colleagues could not do the same. 
[00:32:00]  Especially my husband.  Is it hurtful?  It's not hurtful.  Until you've decided to live your life like this.  Yeah.  You're in the public eye.  Because if it is hurtful and really bothers you, you would actually do something about it.  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  And even if it did hurt her feelings.  Okay.  That stinks that he hurt your feelings.  Right.  And I've gotten emails that hurt my feelings.  You know what?  Yes.  It's part of being in the public.  And you can hit back harshly.  I have no problem with her addressing this guy.  But don't be a fucking victim about it. 
[00:32:30]  You're in the public eye.  He insulted you.  Insult him back if you want.  But don't cry like a little baby about it.  Hit him back.  And she's making it sound like this email was horribly worded, insulting, and stuff.  It was a very well-written opinion on why she, in the public eye, should probably put an unhealthy appearance.  But the guy is also lying, by the way.  Yeah.  He's following the shit that we hate. 
[00:33:00]  He goes, I normally don't do all that shit.  He probably watches every day.  And he hates her.  Yeah, we get that shit.  He knows.  Remember the old days?  Because he said for years, she hasn't.  You know, I was in the car, and my elbow happened to hit, and I came upon your pro.  Shut up.  Just admit you listen, and you don't like us.  Yeah.  Don't make believe you stumbled upon it.  That's bullshit.  Just bullshit.  My colleagues could not do the same, especially my husband, our 6 and 10 anchor, Mike Thompson. 
[00:33:30]  The chubby chaser?  Mike posted this email on his WKBT Facebook page.  Mike.  And what happened next has been truly inspiring.  Hundreds and hundreds of people have taken the time out of their day to not only lift my spirits,  but take a stand that it can't let go.  There's so much to admit.  Oh, it's every fucking word.  And incidentally, why are people's positive comments valid? 
[00:34:00]  Right.  But that negative one is bullying and invalid.  Yeah.  And again, as a performer, I understand.  I love the positive comments, and I smash and block the shitheads, but really, we have  to be honest.  Why are those positive comments, why aren't you considering them, even though they're not  bullying, invalid?  It doesn't make sense to me.  Yeah.  Only nice things.  She should say.  Only say nice things.  And she's making it so much more worse.  I don't care what she says, that everyone has come to her defense. 
[00:34:30]  You just make it worse by acknowledging this.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Yes.  Yes.  Hundreds of people have taken the time out of their day to not only lift my spirits, but  take a stand that attacks like this are not okay.  Now, we're going to have more on that in just a second.  But first, the truth is, I am overweight.  Oh, no.  All right.  Now, she pulls a John Candy.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, I am a little overweight.  Can you go back and say that? 
[00:35:00]  More on that in just a second.  But first, the truth is, I am overweight.  That's terrific.  Okay.  Fair enough, sir.  Fair enough, sir.  Fair enough.  Go on.  Hurt me.  I'm an easy target.  I'm an easy target.  Yeah.  I am overweight.  The moose out front should have told you.  Only that's me.  The hippopotamus out front should have told you.  Just a second.  But first, the truth is, I am overweight. 
[00:35:30]  So if she was, let me ask you, if she was, and I know she's just saying I am overweight,  but she's making choices to eat, and it's really hard.  Food is a motherfucker.  Sure.  It's a really hard one.  Sure.  Because you can't swear off at 100%.  Yeah.  It's like, I equate sex and food as the same one where it's much, much harder to, you can't  just go abstinent, like alcohol and drugs.  But if she was a falling down drunk, and this guy had written and said, look, you look  like shit.  Your drinking is out of control. 
[00:36:00]  Your face is red.  Your nose doesn't look right.  And then she went out and said, you know, this is inappropriate.  First of all, look, I am an alcoholic.  Yeah.  Like, why is this one such a victimized status and not about choice?  Yeah.  But the other one, she could be ostracized for.  There's absolutely some choice involved here.  Completely.  Absolutely.  Dude, you know how hard it is to not eat the shit I want to eat lately?  Right.  I've been eating better for like the last month.  It's fucking brutal.  Yep.  See, I don't want to shove pretzels in my fucking dumb face or cake. 
[00:36:30]  Of course I do.  If she had some self-control and lost weight, she would be looking at that email as having  inspired her to get healthier and lose the weight.  But now it's bullying because she doesn't agree with the opinion.  I will someday comment on why I have hit the gym.  I won't do it now, but I will someday comment on it.  And it's funny.  I never cried about bullying.  I never cried about my feelings being hurt.  Someone got to you.  Annoyed me.  Yeah.  But it was... 
[00:37:00]  I can't find your dick, daddy.  Really?  Yeah.  But I don't...  Again, I didn't even think of that until...  But again, it made me fucking...  It motivated me.  I was like...  Well, first of all, I was like, well, fuck this.  But on the flip side, it motivated me.  And that things can...  Yeah, you can get inspired to do things because of that.  Don't come over to my house.  My kid will point out your flaws like it's nothing.  Oh, kids say the darndest things.  Oh, boy, do they.  Right before you belt them.  Do you know...  Remember, you know, Pete Dominick has a great... 
[00:37:30]  The guy from PONUS has a really funny joke.  And he says, if you want to...  Something about if you want to see what your flaws are or what the...  Have a kid draw you.  And it's a...  That's fucking great.  We got to get that.  It's a brilliant joke because...  That's funny.  How old does the kid have to be?  Oh, shit.  I don't know.  And I think he's got children.  I don't know where...  We should actually do that.  Dude, it's a genius joke because it's exactly...  What's wrong with you, the kid will fucking pick out.  That's Pete Dominick's joke. 
[00:38:00]  Let's go back to the fat newswoman.  Because I don't know her name, so I have to, like, describe her that way.  Okay.  More on that in just a second.  But first, the truth is...  Gosh.  I am overweight.  So to speak, literally...  You can call me fat.  You can call me fat.  Well...  O-M-G.  All right.  Yeah, go back.  More on that in just a second.  But first, the truth is...  I am overweight.  Because you are a disgusting fat body, Private Pile! 
[00:38:30]  So, isn't this great?  All right, let's play that again.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, let's get it.  All right.  More on that in just a second.  But first, the truth is...  I am overweight.  Well...  No shit.  Let's play it, yeah. 
[00:39:00]  Well...  More on that in just a second.  But first, the truth is...  I am overweight.  What's your name, fat body?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  More on that in just a second.  But first, the truth is...  I am overweight.  Hello, exactly!  Open your mouth! 
[00:39:30]  They're paying for it!  You eat it!  You folks fell on your face.  You get an F-minus in my book.  Oh, God.  This job is fun.  Oh, it's hilarious.  More on that in just a second.  But first, the truth is...  I am overweight.  Oh, God!  Jesus. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  Oh, God.  You've got to be kidding me.  What's your name, fat body?  More on that in just a second.  But first, the truth is...  I am overweight.  Food!  All right!  No.  My health doesn't allow it.  More on that in just a second. 
[00:40:30]  But first, the truth is...  I am overweight.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen!  Goodness gracious!  All right, let's play.  Yeah, we've got to get through it.  More on that in just a second.  But first, the truth is...  I am overweight.  Are you about a size 14?  Are you about a size 14? 
[00:41:00]  It's just so fucking juvenile.  I love being immature.  Well, are we going to be mature and move on, you think?  Well, I guess it's...  As we both peer through things.  People don't see the view I get, but I know things like when something played, and I just 
[00:41:30]  see Opie looking down, and I just see fucking Anthony's right shoulder, because I see he's  peering into his machine.  I know.  I know it's going to be a fucking...  There's going to be a lot of mean shit.  Yes.  No, no, no.  Let's get through this.  Oh, okay.  Let's get through this.  More on that in just a second.  But first, the truth is...  Yeah.  I am overweight.  Everybody want a piece of my chicken, so I can try it.  It ain't nothing.  It ain't Friday.  You and me.  Friday.  Ah.  You and me.  Oh, boy. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, God.  All right.  Well.  Man.  Eat that watermelon.  Eat that watermelon.  Jesus.  Jesus.  All right.  Oh, God. 
[00:42:30]  Oh.  Are we going to...  Yeah, I think we should move on.  Are we going to play through it?  More on that in just a second.  But first, the truth is...  I am overweight.  Man.  You are one pathetic loser.  Oh.  Oh.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  That answer is...  True.  Yeah.  I think... 
[00:43:00]  You get nothing.  You lose.  Good day, sir.  All right.  Maybe...  I'll play.  More on that in just a second.  But first, the truth is...  I am overweight.  I am overweight. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's overweight.  She's a big lady.  Oh, she's...  All right.  Why don't we move on?  Truth is...  Yeah.  Let's see what...  Yeah.  Let's see what she says after that.  One third of the way through this clip.  Yeah.  More on that in just a second.  But first, the truth is...  Yeah.  I am overweight.  Right.  You could call me fat.  And yes, even obese on a doctor's chart.  Ah, on a doctor's chart.  But to the person who wrote me that letter...  Whoa.  Whoa. 
[00:44:00]  What's this on a doctor's chart?  That's all shit.  Because she doesn't consider herself obese.  You're big.  You are obese.  Technically, on a doctor's chart.  Here's what she just said.  She's huge.  I'm heavy.  But have you seen some of the real fat fucks out there?  Right.  Right.  She's saying I'm not obese compared to what's out there.  She's in total denial, by the way.  Yeah, of course she is.  To the person who wrote me that letter, do you think I don't know that?  That your cruel words are pointing out something that I don't see?  You don't know me. 
[00:44:30]  You are not a friend of mine.  You are not a part of my family.  And you have admitted that you don't watch this show.  But...  So you know nothing about me...  No, no.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You do know something about her.  She's in the public eye.  Yeah.  She's a fucking public figure.  A fat figure.  Yeah.  But she's discounting this guy's opinion and his freedom and ability to write her a letter.  And this is where she's also incorrect.  She's right. 
[00:45:00]  Like, you don't know me.  But you don't need to know you to understand that you have made choices that have led to obesity.  Yes.  Because the size you are, you're not just eating salads getting that big.  So I can look at her and make a pretty accurate decision about her eating in general.  That it is not that healthy because she's that big.  I absolutely can come to that conclusion without knowing her and without watching her show.  Well, you know nothing about me but what you see on the outside. 
[00:45:30]  And I am much more than a number on a scale.  I will pause a group of numbers.  If you are more than a number on a scale, you're a bunch of them.  I'm also a comma in those numbers.  I am much more than a number on the Richter scale. 
[00:46:00]  Birds are pointing out something that I don't see.  You don't know me.  You are not a friend of mine.  You know nothing about me but what you see on the outside.  And I am much more than a number on a scale.  You see what she's doing right here?  And this is what annoys me.  He didn't say you're a bad person.  Nope.  He didn't say you're a bad wife or a bad mother or you're an invalid newscaster.  Or you're nothing but numbers on a scale.  He didn't say that.  What he said was, I don't even watch this show, but your health or whatever doesn't appear to have it. 
[00:46:30]  He was just commenting on her appearance.  He made no claims to what type of human being she was.  No, and his opinion is that her poor choices in eating is not a good role model.  I hate the whole role model thing.  But he's saying you're not a good role model for kids that might be watching.  And that was the whole point of it.  And I wonder if she objected as vehemently when all these women's groups came out against the Barbie doll.  Right.  Because they all said that's not a realistic role model for a girl to have. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  Is to live up to this blonde, perfect thing.  Not one woman complained about that.  Nope.  However, if you say that I think being obese is a bad role model, well, hey, you don't know me on the inside.  It's, again, you can't have it both ways.  What the guy said was kind of shitty and insulting.  Your feelings are hurt.  I understand that.  But just say that's all it is.  Right.  She wants to have her cakes and eat them too.  Here is where I want all of us to learn something from this. 
[00:47:30]  We're going to learn.  If you didn't already know, October is National Anti-Bullying Month.  And this is a problem that is growing every day in our school.  It's a major issue in the lives of young people today.  And as the mother of three young girls, it scares me to death.  It doesn't scare you.  Hold on.  She's got three kids.  It doesn't scare you to death that your kids might inherit your unhealthy fucking lifestyle. 
[00:48:00]  And why does it scare you to death?  They're taking care of bullying.  Sure.  It was a lot different when we were growing up.  And this is not bullying.  No, man.  Not at all.  Bullying is on everyone's radar as far as kids go and them growing up.  You're not getting away with that shit anymore.  This doesn't fall into the category of bullying at all.  I know, but she's saying that bullying with the three girls and stuff.  So what she wants to say is, only make positive comments about my appearance.  Because if somebody wrote, you're really beautiful, I love the way that fits you, she would have no issue with it. 
[00:48:30]  So if somebody makes a negative comment, she has an issue with it.  I mean, again, I understand why that is as a performer or a person.  But don't come off.  Why don't you just tie this into al-Qaeda and terrorism?  Bullying is not the issue here.  Yeah.  Play, Sam.  For me, I have a very thick skin.  Literally, as that email pointed out.  You need to hold all that in.  And that man's words mean nothing to me.  Pause.  She's lying.  They mean a lot to you.  That's why you bring it up. 
[00:49:00]  That's why you bring it up.  They absolutely mean a lot to her.  Those words point out everything that you think, like when you look in the mirror.  Every day, yeah.  When you straighten out that jacket and you think to yourself, like, well, I look a little slimmer in this and this looks a little bit better.  He hurt your feelings.  He got to you.  He said something awful about what bothers you the most about yourself.  Okay.  But don't lie and give this bullshit.  Yeah.  And otherwise.  And that man's words mean nothing to me. 
[00:49:30]  But what really angers me about this is there are children who don't know better, who get emails, as critical as the one I received, or in many cases, even worse, each and every day.  The Internet has become a weapon.  Our schools have become a battleground.  And this behavior is learned.  It is passed down from people.  And so is overeating.  Now I'm really starting to hate this woman because she's making it about the kids. 
[00:50:00]  Get the fuck out of here.  You didn't like what he said.  It did hurt your feelings.  And even though he's a stranger and he is a jerk off, it mattered to you what he said.  So don't try to segue it into a bigger issue about the children.  Shut the fuck up.  It didn't scare you about the kids.  Keep it where it is.  This guy hurt my feelings, and I don't like what he said, and it shouldn't bother me.  But for some reason, this nobody out there invalidated me in my own opinion. 
[00:50:30]  Stop fucking segueing it about the kids because she feels it's too petty.  Because she knows every counterargument to what she's saying is, so what?  Who cares what he thinks?  So she has to make it a bigger issue where the counterargument doesn't work, and you have to talk it through.  The kids.  Shut up.  Wow.  The children.  Jim Norton, everyone.  But you know what I mean?  That's driving me crazy.  That's a very good point.  ...who wrote me that email.  If you are at home and you are talking about the fat news lady, guess what? 
[00:51:00]  Your children are probably going to go to school and call someone fat.  We need to teach our kids how to be kind, not critical, and we need to do that by...  Why not critical?  No, no, no.  No criticism.  That's all bullying, Anthony.  No criticism.  Don't be critical.  If she wants to be obese, I mean, it is her choice.  It is her choice, and if you're stuck next to her on a plane, too bad.  Right, yeah.  We need to teach our kids...  Notice how not once does she say we need to teach our kids healthy habits.  Right. 
[00:51:30]  We need to teach our kids to take care of their health, to exercise, to live longer lives.  Michelle Obama's childhood obesity, I actually like the fucking cause she took on, because  it's a big problem, and everybody talks about it, and Michelle Obama, why isn't she talking  about that?  We need to emulate what the First Lady of the United States is fighting, which is childhood  obesity.  That's what she should be focusing on, instead of segueing into this guy writing her an email  is going to teach kids to bully.  Bullying.  How about me being up here and being obese is going to teach people to be obese?  Fat news lady. 
[00:52:00]  Ryan, that's great.  Look at your home talking about the fat news lady.  And laughing at her.  Of course.  Now a lot of people are going to be talking about the fat news lady.  Oh, I suspect they will be.  Yeah.  Example.  So many of you have come to my defense over the past four days.  I am literally overwhelmed by your words.  Oh, overweight.  My colleagues and my friends from today and from years ago, my family, my amazing husband,  and so many of you out there that I will probably never have the opportunity to meet. 
[00:52:30]  I will never be able to thank you enough for your words of support and for taking a stand  against this bully.  We are better than the bullies that would try to take us down.  And I leave you with this.  To all of the children out there who feel lost, who are struggling with your weight,  with the color of your skin, your sexual preference.  Oh, God.  Color of your skin is not a lifestyle choice.  You can't dye it black off of yourself. 
[00:53:00]  She's basically saying white is great.  She's putting herself.  She's basically saying white is great.  Well, yeah.  She's acknowledging that.  Finally, something I agree with.  She's making herself a fucking.  She's doing everything.  And maybe she's not lying.  Maybe she really believes.  I can't even say she's lying.  You know what?  She's honestly believing.  She just is convincing herself of this bullshit.  She's putting herself in the category of a downtrodden, the minority, the victim.  Right.  Whereas, you know, if she made some better choices in her life, she wouldn't be. 
[00:53:30]  Dude, I hate fucking not eating what I want to eat.  I hate it.  It stinks.  And I'm eating egg whites.  You think I don't want to eat waffles in the morning or pancakes?  They're delicious.  Who the fuck wants to eat fucking egg whites every morning?  It sucks.  You know what she shoves down that craw?  Ugh.  She just shoves food down there.  And then, you know, she's the victim. 
[00:54:00]  This guy is not a bully.  He's a dick.  Not at all.  And he's not a nice...  He doesn't seem particularly nice.  And he was throwing a jab at her.  And he is insensitive.  That's not bullying.  Who's on the pad data?  It shouldn't be fat reporter.  It should be fat news lady, obviously.  Fat news lady.  Fat news lady is the thing to write.  Marvin, I don't know if he's pissed or happy with us.  Oh, shit, I shot Marvin in the face.  Marvin in Florida.  What's up, Marvin?  I was listening to this story, and what I was thinking is, all newscasters are sleazebags. 
[00:54:30]  We know that.  They have this bullying thing they want to bring up.  So I'm saying they fabricated this letter just so they could bring up the bullying.  Fake.  Totally fake.  I wouldn't put it past a news organization to do just that, sir.  Yeah.  That's exactly what I'm thinking.  I'm sitting here listening to this guy.  It's like, hmm, how do we get into this whole October is anti-bullying thing?  Well, I'm a fat news lady, and maybe I could read a make-believe letter that someone went after me. 
[00:55:00]  Well, then she'd have to agree to throw herself under herself.  No, I think she really got the letter, Marvin.  I think it's a genuine letter.  Yeah, I really do.  I think it was just a shitty, insensitive viewer, and I think she did get the letter, and I think it really got to her.  But I don't like when people go, I don't care what you think of me.  You do.  Yeah.  Admit that you do.  Admit that I don't know why this bothers me or it shouldn't bother me, but it does, and it was mean-spirited.  But don't paint yourself as a fucking victim.  You're making choices that have led to this. 
[00:55:30]  Yep.  And I'm not saying he's a nice guy, but come on.  Yeah.  Black or white or yellow or red.  Those are not-skin colors are not choices.  No.  All right.  Let's finish this up.  It's almost done.  Oh, here we go.  Acne on your face.  Oh.  Listen to me right now.  Okay.  Do not let your self-worth be defined by bullies.  Like I have, don't let your self-worth, don't take some random shitty hater Facebook page 
[00:56:00]  and make it into a news story on television.  Don't do exactly what I have done.  Don't take the criticism of some anonymous jerk off who may be fat.  Right.  Who may be a guy in high school I refuse to fuck.  Who may just be a hater or a hateful person.  Do not take that random comment and turn it into a campaign on television the very way  I have done.  Very good.  That's exactly what she's done.  Of course it's what she's done. 
[00:56:30]  ...that the cruel words of one are nothing compared to the shouts of many.  Yes.  We'll be right back.  You know, that's amazing.  Wow, that's a very dramatic ending.  The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one.  Spoken by a true person with his dentures falling out of his face.  Spock.  And always remember, important.  Yes.  Kind words and compliments are to be believed and are appropriate. 
[00:57:00]  Unkind words are bullying.  Yes.  That's where we live now.  Remember that.  If I can leave you with anything, it is that double standards are acceptable.  Un-fucking-believable.  Yes.  It's turned into this.  It was just fun to make some fat jokes.  It was fucking phenomenal.  It really was.  It was just fun.  Play some sound clips.  We had a great time with old Fatty.  Remember what I said?  I saw this this morning.  I was like, all right.  It was good for her.  Whatever.  Any comments? 
[00:57:30]  Any comments?  I wouldn't mind if she just blasted the guy.  I would prefer she blasted the guy and not played the victim.  If she came out and said, yeah, I'm overweight, some would say obese, but whatever, I've had  a hard time with it.  I would have really loved her if she was just...  There would have been a lot of respect.  She spun it.  But if she was just like, look, food's a tough addiction.  I don't need you being nasty to me about it.  I would have respected her tremendous, but the way...  I have kids. 
[00:58:00]  What's that?  Hey, what happened?  Sam, what's up?  Sam's...  Sam, what do you got going on over there, man?  He's checking the Facebook page.  What's up, Sam?  Come on there.  Sam?  This is not good news.  What happened?  They have some weird viewers.  Why?  What happened?  Where is she from?  She's from La Crosse, Wisconsin.  I was just looking at some pictures.  Oh, my God. 
[00:58:30]  They're making their way onto...  That's the famous picture where that girl looked really...  That's that Facebook voodoo shot?  Oh, right, right, right.  Yeah, her face looked great.  Amazing.  And then there's the rest of her.  That's a little fat news lady.  Fat news lady.  Are people writing nasty things on the Facebook?  Oh, boy.  See, we didn't...  See, that's what...  No, that's probably what happened after she did her...  When did she do that?  Did she do that yesterday?  Yeah, I'm sure it was.  Oh, no.  What happened?  All right, there's a Hungry Hungry Hippos box, but there's a picture of E-Rock naked squeezing 
[00:59:00]  his tits on the box.  Oh, boy.  That's from the Fat E-Rock website?  FatErock.com.  And then, of course, the Hulk...  Hey!  Hey, where are you going?  I did this for you.  It's the Hulkster.  He's doing a leg drop on the building.  It's terrible.  These are all mixed in.  I like cake.  Like, you get this.  One guy writes, great job, Jen.  And the next person writes, I like cake, exclamation point.  Oh, that's just mean.  It looks like they're deleting stuff as they go, because...  I hope so.  The internet's just become a place for bullies. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, it's not right.  But you know what?  Even that, like, guys being dicks, like, on Twitter, I've never once, and I've gotten  some hateful comments, said, why are you bullying me?  You should.  But I've never thought of that.  No, of course.  I've been like, I've written back, go fuck yourself, drop dead, or this guy, you know,  you're a cunt.  But I've never felt bullied.  I just feel like people can be assholes, and I can be an asshole sometimes.  But I never felt victimized by it.  I agree. 
[01:00:00]  Yes.  All right, we should break.  Did you, uh, we...  What happened?  You gotta play, just play a moment of track one, which Travis gave you.  It's, it's...  Right now?  Yeah, before we go.  It's, it's a weird...  I wouldn't call...  I would call it kind of a crutch.  I...  I don't know.  No, no, no, you...  Just, just play a moment of it.  I got a, I got a mystery, uh...  From Travis.  A mystery disc in front of me.  He said he was working on something.  I have no idea what this is.  He said just play it.  Yeah.  And then he says if you play the first track, you're gonna want to play the second track.  It's something I think he was working on, but I, I kind of... 
[01:00:30]  Right?  911, what is the emergency?  I'm on, uh, 10th Avenue northbound and I'm behind a bus.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What?  Oh, my God.  How'd you get this?  Eh, you know, fans send things.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yes.  Superhero Jimmy's 911 call.  Exclusively here on the Opioid Anthony show.  Look, I hate to do this, but this is a tease.  Oh, my God.  We do have to break.  Yeah, we do?  Oh, my God. 
[01:01:00]  How the fuck?  It was emailed to me yesterday, and I, and I'll say that...  Oh, my God.  Why did we waste time with this?  This was funny.  This was funny.  This was hilarious.  Oh, my God.  I fucking, I, Travis, I said don't tell Opioid Anthony, which we're going to play it live  on the air.  I figured that, uh...  Crime Fighter Jimmy's 911 call from yesterday.  We'll explain the whole thing after the break.  Oh, yes.  Also, uh, the third day already of Jocktober. 
[01:01:30]  Jocktober's going to have to wait, because we've got to play the 911ers next.  Also, Tom Papa coming in today, and Amy Schumer.  Just the beginning of that.  Oh, my God.  I'm on, I'm following.  Oh, God, Jimmy.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  We've got listeners everywhere.  Yeah, we do.  Crime Fighter Jimmy.  Nice.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:02:00]  Good choice.  What's going on with these guys, MGMT?  They working on a new album?  Anyone know?  Their last album grew on me.  Just grew on me.  You like MGMT, yeah?  I think we've been down this road, huh?  I really haven't paid much attention to MGMT.  Yeah. 
[01:02:30]  Well, we had that big radio tease.  Yes.  The Jim Norton 911 call.  And then Jimmy leaves the studio.  He's a very busy man.  We can handle this stuff.  Of course we can.  A little stretch.  I'm looking for you.  Listen to their song.  I'm into it today.  I'm looking forward to the debates tonight, by the way.  Are you?  Yes.  It was, you know what?  Very, I have a choice, too.  I could either go to the Yankee game again.  Again. 
[01:03:00]  Or, I kind of want to do a simulcast of the show.  Do a little live from the compound.  Yeah.  And do that.  So I think I'm going to simulcast the debates.  We're allowed to do that with our new contract.  I know.  Exactly.  So I'm thinking of doing that.  I mean, I kind of want to go.  Don't say.  Oh, why?  Because I went to the past two Yankee games, and they've won last night 12 innings.  What excitement at the stadium last night. 
[01:03:30]  It went 12 innings.  It was kind of misty the whole night.  It kind of rained for maybe five minutes, and that was it.  So not a lot of people at the park, but the energy was there in those extra innings.  I can't stand how every time A-Rod comes up, everyone cheers in a plot like he's going  to finally do something.  It's infuriating.  That's your David Blaine.  See?  Yes.  He almost looks like him, too.  He gets.  Although A-Rod's way more talented. 
[01:04:00]  He gets fucking.  He comes out, and everyone's like, whoo, like, here it comes.  Yeah.  And he just, another fucking pop out, another fucking strike out.  But it's just, why do people think he's going to do something?  Does he kind of stink when it matters?  Oh, my God.  He kind of does, right?  Does he ever.  But, wow, was that very cool when they finally fucking tied it up in the bottom of the ninth,  and then took it away.  He fucking won it in 12. 
[01:04:30]  So where are we at?  Well, we're at tonight.  I guess if they win.  The Yankees win, they win the division.  They win the division.  Oh, my God.  You've got to go tonight.  I know.  That's why.  That's a big celebration.  Dude, I'm like, fuck, man.  But no one's allowed to run on the field or anything anymore.  No.  God, I missed that.  Remember?  I don't know.  You got to destroy your own fucking home park.  Amazing.  It was awesome.  But I don't know. 
[01:05:00]  I'm just going to leave it to the Yankees.  I'm going to leave them.  I was very proud, though.  I took the subway all by myself from my apartment to Yankee Stadium without anybody's help.  You went by yourself.  I went solo last night.  I just went solo.  I would have gone.  What?  No, I did.  I swear.  No, no.  I'll be shaking his head going, no, you didn't.  I swear.  I swear to you I went alone.  To what?  Why would you do that?  Because it was cool.  You've got friends. 
[01:05:30]  Not really.  The Yankee game?  No.  Yeah.  He went by himself.  I didn't really have any.  But the D train at Yankee Stadium is easy.  Game nights, it's easy.  Do that on a, like, I don't know, a Friday night when the Yankees aren't playing.  Oh, well.  And then tell your story.  No.  How brave you were.  Well, I had to take the C first.  The C?  To the D?  Then I got off at the 145th Street.  Oh, boy.  That's a little off.  And I got to the D. 
[01:06:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Why did you just take the D?  What?  I couldn't find the D.  There's no D by my apartment.  The D's right downstairs.  From here?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm up on 451st.  You're not that far.  That's two blocks.  That's two blocks.  Why would I walk when I could just pop into the fucking station is right next to my apartment?  Oh, you got the C near you, but you didn't want to walk to two blocks for the D.  But if you walk to the D, then you don't have to do the transfer.  I didn't care about the transfer. 
[01:06:30]  All right.  It was cold.  What did you see on the train?  A lot of Yankees fans?  Yeah, you know, those Yankee game trains, you got a lot of Yankee fans.  I just, you know, you sit there and you fucking H-stop.  You got to look at someone else's stupid face across from you.  Yeah, I know.  And you got to put your head down so you're not looking at anybody.  Do you have to stand?  I did have to stand and grab the Petri dish pole.  I hate that thing.  When you're on the subway and you look at that person like you just said, you always wonder  to yourself, is he going to be the one that rubs his penis on me and molests me?  That's all I think about when the train's crowded, that there's someone rubbing and coming in 
[01:07:00]  their pants.  There's someone that just wants to rub their turgid rod on you.  A rubber.  And they don't care if it's a girl, a fucking man, a boy.  They don't give a fuck.  Not at all.  They just need to rub their turgid penis.  Yeah.  Well, I did that.  That's good.  Got to the stadium.  A lot of fun.  Of course, our connection at the stadium.  Mm-hmm.  She better fucking take care of me.  It's been a while.  Let me tell you something. 
[01:07:30]  She rules.  I know she rules.  I got a seat last night right behind the Yankee dugout.  Wow.  It was actually to the press.  Wow.  Right next to the dugout.  It was just amazing seats.  Who was our friend in the Yankee?  Yes.  I want to go.  She is the best.  She comes up.  She takes me down into the Legends area for dinner.  Gets me a seat right there.  I'm just dining, watching the beginning of the game.  But you know what?  Fantastic.  We've taken care of her over the years, too.  So relax.  She told me, I can't tell you how many times I sat in my driveway and laughed at you guys. 
[01:08:00]  So it's payback for all that.  Let me tell you something.  The more you talk, the more you talk, the more times she's going to sit me down at my table and turn to me and go, what's with Opie, that fuck?  He's not going to get shit out of me.  No.  You watch.  You watch how I fucking spin this shit.  And I said, I hear you.  Believe me, I appreciate the tickets.  Who was at the Pearl Jam show?  I was.  This is the same connect that you complained about the Pearl Jam show? 
[01:08:30]  Yes.  Because when you went to the Pearl Jam show, you said.  Yeah, I didn't complain.  You didn't have VIP tickets.  She should have done better.  It was open seating.  If you got an amazing connection, then they should do better.  But it was open seating.  No, there was some kind of like Budweiser VIP areas that were nice.  There was.  There were some stages that were a little higher.  They weren't close to the stage.  But then you got the Ron Howard backstage.  He's much more famous than you.  I'm not saying he isn't.  But this connection we got, she could get things done.  And I think she got lazy that day.  Oh, my God.  And she's on notice. 
[01:09:00]  You're hanging yourself here.  She's on notice.  You're hanging yourself here.  She's on notice with me.  I think she got a little lazy.  I want her to know.  Because she took care of me at Yankee Stadium.  I had the amazing seats like Anthony.  I am totally happy of everything you've done for me.  I think she got a little lazy.  And I don't think you got lazy at all, my dear.  I think you've done a fantastic job.  I am nothing but grateful.  You know what?  I'm going to write her right now and tell her she got a little lazy with the Pearl Jam tickets.  And she owes me.  Oh, Jesus.  And I want a, and I want a, I'm sorry, and I want a, I will try to do better next time. 
[01:09:30]  You might get that, but you're not getting tickets.  This is what we talked about with burning bridges.  I want to go to that Yankee.  What happened?  You want to go?  What are they playing?  Tonight.  I can't tonight.  I got an event.  Tonight's the day you got to go.  Game before the playoffs.  All right, then you can, then.  Can I go to the playoffs?  Well, I would hope so.  I'd pay for the tickets.  She doesn't have to get me a free ticket.  If she'd get me a good ticket.  Oh, yeah.  You just want good tickets, don't you?  Yeah, nice seat.  She might go, Jimbo, welcome.  Hey.  Do you have her number? 
[01:10:00]  I deleted her from my phone after the Pearl Jam.  Oh, what?  You're kidding.  I was mad.  No, I'm not.  Why were you mad?  I don't, I, I just got a little upset.  I really thought she could have done better.  You are.  Yeah, I really don't have her anymore.  When I texted last night, I was like, I was like, oh, these seats are great, thank you.  Because they were great.  I guarantee she'll say I'm sorry before the end of the show.  This will get back to her.  Ticket diva.  Yeah.  No, not really.  Just try a little harder.  You can't take a situation like that and shit on it.  Oh, my God.  No. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, my God.  So, Jim Norton.  You know, the reality is with this show that there's a lot of people right now that don't  know what happened yesterday on the show.  But, Jimmy.  So, we got to set this up before we play the piece of audio we got.  Well, I was driving home a couple nights ago.  And I was behind a bus on 10th Avenue northbound, which is how I tend to describe it when I'm calling 
[01:11:00]  911.  Jimmy did the movie version of what he felt he should do in this situation.  The audio is okay.  I mean.  It's better than okay.  But, the point is, you thought it was a stolen bus.  You followed it for about eight minutes.  And then, after eight minutes, you couldn't be bothered anymore.  Well, I followed it.  And then, I called back.  I just took a call.  Because the first time, I thought they were going to do something.  And I followed it north.  Then, I followed it north, west, south, west, and then north again. 
[01:11:30]  So, it was a double bus.  And apparently, that thing on the back.  Double bus.  Fucking double bus, motherfucker.  Big, big car, suckers.  Take us out, you fucking news lady.  No, no, no.  We just got away.  You've been sitting on that, you bastard.  No, I love it.  Okay.  All right.  Oh, my God.  That's too good, man.  So, and then, I called back.  And they just learned this.  I thought it should have gotten a greater amount of attention.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, here's the 911 call from superhero Jimmy. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, that's okay.  It was good for about eight minutes, fighting crime.  This is a short call, though.  911, what is the emergency?  I'm on 10th Avenue northbound, and I'm behind a bus.  And the sign says, call cops 911 on the bus.  It's bus number 5610.  We're on 10th Avenue, and it's crossing 47th Street.  Okay.  So, you said it's 10th Avenue, and it's crossing what? 
[01:12:30]  47th.  No, we're northbound.  And now we're crossing 48th.  I'm right behind this bus, but that automatic sign.  Okay.  So, it says west.  So, I'm just trying to get there.  You said it's 10th Avenue on west 47th Street?  Yes.  And now I'm at 49th.  We're northbound.  Northbound.  Is it an NTA bus?  Yes, it is.  Bus number 5610.  Oh.  Five, sixer, one, or zeroer.  Five, or six, one, zero. 
[01:13:00]  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Oh, my God.  Oh, you're volunteering information.  Yes, I am.  Very happy to help.  Oh, my God.  Doing my civic duty.  One, zero.  Oh.  And you said it's heading which way, sir?  Northbound.  The only way you can go on 10th Avenue.  And now it's about to make a left.  We're on 10th making a up.  Hold on.  It's still going straight here.  Okay.  It's still going straight.  Yeah. 
[01:13:30]  It looks like it's going to make a left on 57th Street.  On 57th Street?  Yep.  It's a double bus.  Just made a left on 57th Street.  Oh.  She doesn't care.  No one cares.  She just doesn't care.  No one cares about this.  She doesn't care.  It's like, why is my time being wasted by this wannabe crime fighter? 
[01:14:00]  Oh, God.  Yes.  There he is.  Ah, yeah.  Bus 5, Niner, Niner, 3.  Make sure.  Yes, I'm in pursuit.  I need backup, though.  I need you to send a system.  Eh, I got him going home.  I'm tired.  You turn.  You turn. 
[01:14:30]  It's one of those double-decker buses, correct?  No, it's a double bus.  Why?  I love how annoyed you are.  You're trying to be cool, because you're fighting crime right now.  But you're getting so annoyed, because she's getting everything wrong.  Yeah, which way on 10th Avenue?  There's only one way, stupid.  You told her, look, 10th Avenue, it only goes one way.  And now you're like, no, it's not a double-decker.  I told you already.  It's just a double bus.  A double bus is different than a double-decker.  A double bus is correct? 
[01:15:00]  No, it's a double bus.  One after the other.  One after the other.  Okay.  And we're headed towards 11th Avenue.  And it says call 911?  Yes.  Call cops.  Call 911.  Call cops.  I'm just getting the information.  Oh, yeah, no, no, I know.  One shit at a time.  I'm getting the information.  No, she says I was getting irritated.  Thank you, nice lady.  I mean, because she's not writing anything down or whatever.  She stinks.  You've got to repeat everything to her.  I'm in high-speed pursuit, making a left on 57th. 
[01:15:30]  This is Sheriff Jim T. Norton.  Jim T. Cell.  Oh, yeah, no, no, I know.  I know it sounds repetitive.  I'm just getting all the information.  I understand.  And now I'm making a left on 11th Avenue, southbound, still behind this bus.  All right, so what is your name?  James Norton.  N-O-R-T-O-N.  Oh, James Norton, November, Oscar. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  I know.  It was very official.  It was very official.  Jimmy's just a nice guy in the end.  He always tries to do the right thing.  He's trying to be helpful.  All right, sir.  Assistance will be there as soon as possible.  Thank you so much for calling.  I'm southbound on 11th right now, pulling up.  Uh, 55th Street. 
[01:16:30]  Do you want to stay on?  She's passing a cop right now.  He's parked for a fire.  I mean, because of the return.  So the last course that you just passed by now.  What is that on?  11th?  54th Street.  Stop what you're doing, police.  If she wants me off this fucking course, she does.  I guess she's not allowed to hang up on you for whatever reason.  No.  Bus with a light on.  Wow.  It's embarrassing that he said, maybe I should just stay on with you.  I know.  Like I'd be giving directions to the cops until they cut them off.  Of course.  Yes, you would.  I'm a cunt. 
[01:17:00]  You're giving suggestions to the police officers.  If you cut up 57, you can head them off at the pass.  I love you.  You're 11th and 54th.  Okay, 54th.  I'm calling you super scallop.  All right, sir.  Thank you so much for calling.  Okay.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Oh, no.  So, uh.  That's call one.  How did you feel at that point?  Irritated that I didn't feel, um.  I was like, I was probably taking you seriously.  Yeah, I'll probably take a cop a minute or two.  That's cut down.  That was a much longer call with pauses and shit. 
[01:17:30]  But I think I will get the cops here shortly.  Um.  And I followed him for a total of about eight or nine minutes.  I kept following.  Oh, God.  We went all the way down 11th.  Right.  Oh, boy.  This is after we went down 11th.  And then we made a right on 34th.  And, uh.  He had lost me in a light.  Mm-hmm.  And then that was when he was slowing down before hitting the red light.  Like, I knew he knew I was behind him.  And before we made the right on the West Side Highway.  Anyway, so, uh.  You called back.  Because you still don't see the cops. 
[01:18:00]  Yes.  Pursuing the boss.  So, Jimmy called 911 again.  No, always.  Emergency.  Hi.  I'm on.  I tried to get called and no one is doing anything.  I'm sorry.  I just called and no one is doing anything.  There's a crime being committed.  Do you understand what I'm trying to tell you people?  It's like he's seeing a murder happen.  Yeah.  And there's no help coming.  Yeah.  Concerned, Jimmy. 
[01:18:30]  Jimmy's so disappointed.  Eight minutes.  Eight minutes of utmost concern.  No one's taking me seriously.  No one's doing anything.  No one's doing anything.  For Pete's sake.  For Pete's sake.  No, always.  Emergency.  Hi.  I'm on.  I tried to get called and no one is doing anything.  I'm following a stolen bus, I think.  Enough about the bus.  He figured he'd make it sound more important.  Not just, there's a bus with a light on.  Now it's like, it's a stolen bus.  I think.  I think.  Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. 
[01:19:00]  I'm following a stolen bus.  I'm in pursuit of a stolen bus.  I'm glad I didn't mention any hostages.  Oh, God.  It says, call cops.  I'm northbound on the west side highway now.  Westbound on the north side highway.  Where were you before when you called?  Who cares?  On 10th Avenue and 11th Avenue, it's a double bus, and it's northbound on the west side highway.  By what street is it crossing over?  34th Street.  We just passed over 34th Street.  I think he knows I'm right behind him. 
[01:19:30]  But there's no cops doing anything.  I think he knows that I'm following him.  He said, I think it's a, uh, yes, it looks like a stolen bus.  How did you make that assumption?  Jimmy, how did you make that assumption?  Are you qualified to say that?  I am, yes.  I just think it's a stolen bus.  It looked stolen because of the way he was driving.  I felt he was driving a little erratically.  And I also, that big sign on the back was flashing.  Did you feel because it was an African-American gentleman driving that that made you think  it was stolen more so than if it had been a white gentleman? 
[01:20:00]  No, I didn't, uh, no.  If he would have had a uniform on, I would not have thought that.  But it was pitch black in the bus.  There was no internal light on.  And you never see it that dark in the bus.  Oh, boy.  There was something shady going on.  Oh, boy.  Dark, shady.  I'm hearing catchphrases, keywords.  I like how you paused.  You said, it looks like, yeah, it's a stolen bus.  It looks like, oh, wait, wait.  Upon further investigation, it's a stolen bus.  Yes.  I think we have a 836 in progress. 
[01:20:30]  Geez, Jimmy, this is great.  I was helping.  You were helping.  You are adorable.  The call cops thing is on.  But no one is doing anything about it.  So he's northbound now.  And he's almost stopped driving because he knew I was following him.  What's the bus number?  I already gave him.  I don't remember.  So I just passed him.  I'm sick of following him and no cops are coming.  But I've been following him for 10 minutes.  But now we're passing 40th Street.  But before when you called, what's the street you gave? 
[01:21:00]  10th and 11th, but then he came down 11th, and now we went up 10th.  He's probably going to turn off because you're going to lose him.  But I can't believe he can't get a squad car in Manhattan to follow the fucking guy.  Now you're cursing.  Squad car.  There's a lot going on here, though, because she doesn't know about the prior call for whatever reason.  If you're a 911 operator in New York City, wouldn't some of that shit be popping up on the screen so they could cross-reference it?  Crowler needs a jump. 
[01:21:30]  As funny as this is, obviously, there is some fucked up shit in here.  And who cares where I was before?  Of course.  Where I am now, dummy?  Tell the cops.  Did he start throwing JFK's golf clubs out at your car?  I know that one.  Dude, I can't get a squad car in Manhattan to follow the fucking guy.  You keep saying 10th and 11th, but 10th and 11th are on parallel.  What street and 11th?  I know.  He was on 10th, and then he went down 11th.  On what street?  Now he just went back up north.  Oh, my God.  You're not going to get to 40th.  But now, right now, he just turned off. 
[01:22:00]  Okay.  Forget it.  You know what?  He just turned off.  He just turned off.  Okay.  Okay.  And that's it.  Forget it.  Forget it.  You finally had it.  Yeah.  But that's how dumb they are.  Yeah.  Well, yes.  But, I mean, they probably heard that and just said, who gives a shit?  Where were you before?  Who gives a fuck?  I'm here.  I'm on 34th and Westside Highway.  Send the police.  What they're probably not telling you is they made a quick call, and they went, no, that's  our guy in that bar. 
[01:22:30]  That's Reggie.  They don't even care.  Yeah.  Do you understand, though, Jimmy?  It was very important to you.  I understand.  You were making the call.  You wanted some kind of result.  That was the same service that was called when people said, there's a plane crashing into  a building.  Yeah.  You know, a real emergency.  I know.  I'm surprised they didn't say, what was the longitude and latitude of the plane that was  coming in?  What kind of plane was it?  How many people are in first class, and how many were upgrades? 
[01:23:00]  That's probably the type of questions they asked on 9-11ers, asshole fucking operators.  I love official Jimmy.  I'm fucking, they both annoyed me so much.  People are so uncomfortable, they're just writing, oh God, hang up already, Jesus.  It is.  It's so uncomfortable.  Is it uncomfortable?  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  We're trying to do the right thing.  Well, kudos to whoever fucking found that and sent it in, because that's just amazing  that we talked about that yesterday. 
[01:23:30]  And we got it.  And we got the call.  Yep.  Trying to do the right thing, and no one cares.  I just want to be helpful.  You certainly did.  You're a crime fighter, Jimmy.  I'm a helpful boy.  You are.  I'm a good citizen.  You really are.  And it's because of people like him who help the police.  We are going to take a break, and when we get back, we're getting into day three of  Jocktober.  All right.  I can't wait.  I don't even know who's featured today, to tell you the truth.  It seems like a very similar show.  Well, we get a lot of these. 
[01:24:00]  Yes, we do.  You got the guy, you got the girl, and you got another guy.  Oh, nice.  I love a good show.  You got the other guy's a little edgy, you got the radio veteran, and then the whole.  Seems like we're following that formula today.  They're all similar shows.  Well, when you get a successful format, why would you...  And they all wonder why they don't stand out.  Because there's a million shows doing exactly what you're doing.  It's all the same show out there.  That's why you're not standing out.  Tell your stupid PD, no, I'm not going to have a fucking hole.  And I'm not going to have the fake edgy guy that does sports and stays out all night. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, yeah.  Can I give the listeners a hint as to what state we're going to?  No.  Ooh.  Because it kind of fucked up our Facebook thing.  No, last time it did because Danny said the name of the show when he was in here.  Oh.  I think there's a lot of people to wear.  They're shaking their boots.  Oh, yeah.  You mentioned a state, and I think a lot of those radio stations will say,  you know what, fuck it, we don't know if it's us, but let's just shut down everything.  That's what I meant to tell you.  I'm still friends with the guy who was Scorch's sidekick in Syracuse. 
[01:25:00]  He's still working in radio up there.  Yeah.  And he was texting me and said, you have no idea how many texts I got today.  He said this to me yesterday about what happened to Ted and Amy.  Oh, really?  Like, you were the talk of Syracuse radio yesterday.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  And shutting down their Facebook page and everything.  Yeah, everybody in Syracuse was in their Syracuse radio industry.  We were on the radar up there.  Oh, big time.  People realize when this is going on. 
[01:25:30]  We move on to somebody else now today.  Some guy wants, some guy is calling saying he sent in the phone call, but I, all right.  I don't know if we should do that.  The guy wants credit.  Well, put him on if it's him.  Yeah, but I think it's, all right.  Yo, Pat.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  You're sending the call.  Thank you.  Yeah, no problem.  I sent the new Jimmy's email.  Yeah.  How did you get the call?  I work for the department, so I have access to some of that stuff.  Were you laughing when you found it and listened to it? 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, you know, I happened to listen on the radio.  And when I got the call, the second call, especially when it gets all pissed off, I was dying laughing at work.  That's great.  How come nobody was leaping into action?  I used to work over there, man.  They hear those calls all the time.  They don't want to be bothered with that crap.  They get to the corner, the bus is gone, and they just say, all right, you know, unfounded or whatever.  Yeah, we're on it.  Yeah.  If you go about your business, we're on it.  Don't worry.  Yeah, exactly.  Basically, there's more important things to do.  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:26:30]  Definitely more important things to do.  They didn't want to stay on the phone with me while the police chased them down, while I gave locations.  Chased them down.  Was that your dream, Jimmy?  I love the fact.  You'd be on the phone.  A little danger.  A little danger, but you'd back off a little.  And then the cops would come flying in from the side, maybe crash into the bus to stop it.  He's bound on 50th, crossing over 7th Avenue, southbound.  Little Jimmy's out there.  And afterwards, he's got a medal pinned on him at City Falls.  One of the cops just got me out there, and I'm parked twice. 
[01:27:00]  They're cuffing him.  Yeah.  Well, what happened was I was on my way home.  They're thanking you.  What's that?  Jimmy can star in Speed 3.  Yeah, following the Speed 3.  Speed 3.  He follows a bus on its way to the maintenance garage.  Well, thank you for sending, man.  That was a great grab.  Yeah.  No problem, guys.  Thanks, man.  Take care, Pat.  Take care, Bill.  I just didn't want to take his call because I didn't want to get him in trouble.  Yeah, he's all right, I guess.  Quick break, and we roll right into Jocktober next, and Tom Popper joins us as well.  Amy Schumer a little later. 
[01:27:30]  Stay there.  The opening of the show.  It's Jocktober.  A celebration of all things shitty in radio.  That's not very nice.  Very nice.  Fantastic failures of pontificating proportions.  That's so bad.  Wow.  An interactive exploration of what makes radio rancid.  Jocktober.  OMG.  Hosts, holes, bits, and stunt boys. 
[01:28:00]  This isn't funny.  It's time for Jocktober.  Jocktober.  How happy are you?  It's time for Jocktober.  Oh, man.  Day three.  Love Jocktober.  God, I love Jocktober.  I like the new intro.  I like it a lot.  We move on from Syracuse.  That was yesterday.  And we're going to go up to Maine, huh?  Oh, yeah.  To Maine's classic rock.  Ooh.  What's their slogan?  Classic rock. 
[01:28:30]  It's 107.5 Frank FM.  Frank FM.  And, of course, the show is Stan, Heidi, and Joe.  All right.  Do they feed your need for rock?  No, they just...  They don't feed your need for rock.  They don't do that, no.  Really?  Oh, my God.  But they do consider themselves Maine's classic rock.  What do you see, Andy?  I'm seeing the website here.  It's the exact same show.  It's Stan, the seasoned veteran.  He's the seasoned radio veteran. 
[01:29:00]  Heidi's the hole.  Yep.  And, of course, Joe's the gruff guy.  Look out, Joe.  Looks a little like Patton Oswalt.  A little bit.  But I bet you he's a bit edgy.  Oh.  I bet you he has a tough time getting there in the morning because he's out.  He's out at the sports bars.  Yeah.  This is going to be bad.  I don't know.  Why?  Because on their Facebook page, again, I think it's a terrible idea for anybody to...  We have never said attack.  No, never.  Please don't, as a matter of fact. 
[01:29:30]  Don't do it.  Just don't.  We've never said that.  But they're asking their listeners, what do you think of how she handled this?  And it's the video of the fat news lady.  Oh, really?  I mean, that's double trouble, if you ask me.  Oh, shit.  They're just asking the people to be rude.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  They actually posted that?  Yeah.  But, again, that's not something any of you should do.  So why don't we get right into this today?  Yes.  It's Stan, Heidi, and Joe on Maine's Classic Rock 107.5 Frank FM.  Another trend in radio. 
[01:30:00]  You go with the first name for your radio station.  Yeah, yeah.  It's that personal touch.  Personal.  Hey, I'm listening to Frank.  You feel like you know him a little more.  Yeah, you certainly do.  They gave up on the animals for a while.  Now it's first names.  Yeah.  The fox.  Yeah.  Well, I worked at a couple foxes.  I worked at a couple animal stations in my time.  Uh, we start with Joe's, um, so Joe's what?  The, uh, the, the kid?  The younger guy?  Yeah.  Okay.  Just so people know.  We start with Joe's Dumbass News. 
[01:30:30]  And it's called Dumbass News?  Nice.  That's edgy.  I don't want anybody to think I'm referring to it as Dumbass News.  Of course.  Like, that's what the segment's called.  They call it Dumbass News.  Yeah, because Joe's Prep Burger News was, like, you know, too inside, I guess.  You think they're Prep Burgers?  Maybe.  You think they use the Prep Burger?  It's the same show.  Guilty of using the Prep Burger?  It's day three of Jocktober.  We've already followed it.  These are the same shows as each other.  Now, who else uses, uh, Prep Burger?  Who?  David Blaine. 
[01:31:00]  Does he?  Yes, he does.  That's where he gets his stunts.  A stunt you could do for listener involvement?  Well, we're gonna hear, uh, Joe's Dumbass News as the trio's chemistry flows through the radio.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's the difference maker about this show, that a lot of shows can cover the same  things.  But it's the chemistry between these three that really sort of...  All right.  It's Joe Lerman's Dumbass News.  I'm Frank FM.  Well, in, uh, Brooksville, Florida, guys, Shaheed Mohammed Kalam, I believe that is his 
[01:31:30]  name.  If not, it is now.  Where's he from?  He deposited a, uh, $1,000 check.  I think he's from Delaware.  Uh, $1,000 check of a, uh, stolen or forged variety.  This is the same show.  We already heard this.  So we really don't have to do Jack-tober.  Here's the guy.  We've kind of done it, right?  Hey, and, uh, here's a story.  It's like, uh, and now they'll try to riff with it, right?  And it just will go nowhere.  You don't think it'll go anywhere?  Oh, never does.  Well, don't be too sure, Mr. Know-it-all. 
[01:32:00]  Who's the pig?  Eric.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, Jesus.  Oh, look, he's just sitting there.  He's not even the poor guy.  Does he know what we're talking about?  Yeah, I wouldn't think so.  He's, uh, he's either downloading bikini pictures.  He loves bikini girls.  Uh, writing fan fiction.  WWE fan fiction.  Right.  Or, uh, memoirs of his time spent as a youth in school in Florida.  Or, I've heard he's writing a book about working for Scott Shannon.  Oh, yeah, really? 
[01:32:30]  I've heard it.  That'll be a page-turner.  Yeah.  A thousand-dollar check of a, uh, stolen or forged variety at 3 a.m. at a local credit  union, and then attempted to withdraw the cash from an ATM.  Unfortunately for Shaheed, the ATM card he used was expired, and he was using the wrong  PINCO.  Oh, no.  The machine swallowed the card, prompting Shaheed to back his vehicle up into the ATM machine,  tie a seat belt to it, and attempt to rip it off the wall. 
[01:33:00]  That always goes well.  When that predictably failed, Shaheed used a stolen handgun to fire a bullet through the  front door, shattering the glass.  Yes, the ATM surveillance camera captured the comedy of errors, and Shaheed was busted when  he returned to the credit union for unrelated business.  I'm exhausted.  What other business do you have in the credit union?  Yeah, you don't have a valid card, you don't have a valid account, you don't have anything.  There is no business at the credit union.  Probably he was trying to make a withdrawal.  Yeah, I get, probably. 
[01:33:30]  Wow.  Holy shit, that was exhausting.  The radio voice is what drives me crazy.  Yeah, yeah.  And he was trying to make a withdrawal.  But he sounds like Pat Oswald, too.  He sounds like him.  Yes.  I've, I've, yes, I've seen Ratatouille enough to know.  Trust me.  Oh, my God.  Move on to another movie, kid.  Sure.  But you guys don't like how the bit kind of crescendoed?  Crescendoed?  Yeah.  There's a nice little fucking zinger at the end.  Yeah.  That would be the out.  Frank F. 
[01:34:00]  Tom Papa joins us as we're doing Jocktober.  Did they tell you what we're doing?  Good morning.  Have you been here for Jocktober yet?  I've never been here for Jocktober.  Welcome.  You might not want to be here for Jocktober.  Welcome to Bridgeburner's 101 for comics.  Now you see one day, a month, and what I have to fucking navigate as I go on the road.  Oh, no.  And realize, oh, we attacked this show.  Yeah.  You play anywhere up in Maine?  Because that's where we are.  Portland.  Are you in Portland?  Portland, Oregon, for that matter. 
[01:34:30]  This is a show in Maine, I guess.  You've done some of these radio shows, huh, Tom?  Oh, yeah.  We've got painter's caps this morning.  We're bringing little Jimmy Norton.  He's kind of crazy.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's it.  I've been him.  That's awful.  All the time.  Why do they do that?  They're trying to muster up some energy.  They hate their lives.  Because, yeah.  All right.  We're going to move on.  It's Stan, Heidi, and Joe on Maine's Classic Rock, 107.5 Frank FM.  That's right.  So was that it with the dumb ass news? 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  I mean, I thought, yeah.  The chemistry was pretty good, though.  And the great punchline at the end is delivered, and they move on to the next story.  It's just...  A story about a woman with her kid in the trunk of her car.  Don't worry.  Heidi brings the funny.  Leave it to Heidi.  Oh, she's still a little nutty.  You can tell already, right?  Yeah, Heidi is really kind of unpredictable.  When Washington State Patrol troopers pulled over Ann Boyle for speeding, they noticed that  she seemed a bit nervous.  Now, it could have been because she had, you know, speed, heroin, pills, and drug paraphernalia 
[01:35:30]  in her car.  Or maybe it was just the marijuana aroma that was billowing from the vehicle.  When the trooper inquired about the smell, Ann admitted that she took a few hits earlier.  As officers were searching the vehicle, they heard a thumping sound coming from the trunk.  Which turned out to be Anna's eight-year-old daughter, her two sons, ages seven and five,  and a small dog.  Child Protective Services took the kids into custody, and police took Anna and her fiancé  into custody as well. 
[01:36:00]  Why would you put three kids and a dog in the trunk?  Whatever.  Well, I mean, listen.  God!  And she, and, hey, by the way.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  The chemistry is amazing.  The wit.  The wit.  Yeah.  And now we welcome Amy Schumer.  The lovely Amy Schumer.  We're in the middle of Jocktober.  Yes.  Have you been here for Jocktober, Amy?  I have not.  Oh, boy.  Do you play any places in Maine?  No.  Oh, good.  You're good today, man. 
[01:36:30]  Because we're totally wiping one radio station off the map for any comics.  That is in such a way with this show.  Yeah.  Even guys that aren't here will feel their wrath.  Yes.  And we're focusing on this show today, and there's two guys in the hole.  Is this?  These are the people?  Yeah.  Okay.  The pig is the hole.  Amy, you might, you might, this might sound familiar to you when we did the Louie thing.  Oh, are they the real deal?  Exactly like that.  Yeah.  Oh, now. 
[01:37:00]  It's, ugh.  Whatever.  It's terrible.  I just see no reason for those people to be alive.  Yes.  That's exactly why we do this.  Until you have to sell tickets in Maine.  There's no, there's zero demand for me in Maine.  There's no demand in there.  Oh, and now Sam's way over there.  Sam?  We need some lumberjack jokes.  Yeah, Sam.  Yeah.  A million hit Sam.  A million?  How about fucking four?  You just insulted him.  Five million hits.  It's five million hits.  One hit, one of Sam's.  It's crazy.  It's crazy.  He just insulted him. 
[01:37:30]  I apologize.  He's a web juggernaut.  I wasn't even looking for him.  I just went on YouTube and he was on the main page.  I was like, what the?  Infuriating, right?  Is that the same?  What the hell?  Did you have a viral video?  Oh, you did.  Oh, boy, did he.  Finally.  What are you doing?  For the iPhone 5.  Yeah, interviewing a woman who was waiting for the iPhone 5, but she didn't know anything  about the iPhone 5.  She was whack-a-doodle.  She was so psyched to get it and she wanted it.  She waited online.  She was one of those people that were within the first ten people online or something. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  And she was waiting for days.  And then Sam asked her about the phone and what she's excited about, the features.  She knew nothing about it.  She just knew she had to get it.  It was frightening.  But she's kind of like a weird squirrel lady.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Kind of bizarre.  She wanted people to buy it so they can make it at her company.  Do you know what I mean?  You'll see those.  Oh, she doesn't have a company.  I think this lady lived in a hollowed out tree.  She could reverse engineer the box that came in. 
[01:38:30]  She looks like Vern Troyer.  But it's literally, you know how you do stand-up where you create videos and then you're like,  I can't wait until I get like, maybe I'll get a lot of hits on this and nothing happens.  This is going to be the one.  Sam just blew everyone out of the world.  I've never caught lightning in a bottle.  I've had it and I dump it out of the side and ignore it.  Who's going to want this?  Our ticket connection got back to me.  Oh, what did she say?  Bye-bye.  See? 
[01:39:00]  Bye-bye.  You shit on her.  That's the bridge.  We have a connection at Yankee Stadium for Yankee tickets.  She's amazing.  Love her to death.  And Opie just shits on her.  And now, me?  I've been to the Yankee game the past two nights.  I could go tonight if I wanted to.  Your crazy Twitter pic from the, like, two feet from Jeter?  Amazing, right?  Man, oh man.  Are you a stalker, Tom Papa?  You know a lot about us.  I miss you guys.  You guys are fascinating.  I hadn't seen you since June.  I just came like, what are those guys doing? 
[01:39:30]  What happened?  I was gone the whole summer.  Anything good?  Yeah, I shot a movie.  Ooh.  Thanks for asking.  Can we get back to Sam's video?  You couldn't see it, but I watched you.  A movie with who there, Tom Papa?  Michael Douglas.  Wow.  And Matt Damon.  Well.  Did you cut your chops?  It's the Liberace movie.  You cut your chops.  Tom plays the ace.  I trimmed them back a little.  This, uh, starring as the virus, the invading design-y Tom Papa. 
[01:40:00]  Tom Papa the boss.  This is your second Matt Damon movie, by the way.  Yes, it is.  Yes.  Yeah, we're good pals now.  I guess so.  It's not a big deal.  You're co-stars.  Wow.  Co-stars.  Yeah, exactly.  I play Liberace's manager.  I play, uh, Michael Douglas' manager.  Hey, Lee.  Hey, pal.  Hey, pal.  They call him Lee.  Yeah, they call him Lee.  Very good.  Lee, I remember when he would be on, uh, like Mike Douglas and things like that.  Yeah.  We always, we always talk about how they, Mike, uh, Douglas and Merv and everybody would, would  interview him and talk, talk to him about women. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  Like, oh, you know, any women in your life, Lee?  Uh, you know, any lucky ladies?  Oh, I'm still lucky.  And everybody back then was like, well, he's lucky.  Oh, really?  They just accepted it.  Yeah, no.  No one even.  No.  He fought it off three times in the press.  Yeah, yeah.  People said he was gay and he fought it off three times in one.  I also, I think of Liberace as being way further in the past than, that he could have been  on the Mike Douglas show.  Yeah.  Well, he died in the 80s.  Yeah. 
[01:41:00]  In the AIDSies, we call it.  That decade was crazy.  So hot to die of AIDS.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know a lot about this Liberace.  It was a grapefruit disease.  Aw.  Isn't that what they said?  Yeah.  It was a grapefruit related.  Really?  Yeah.  It was on a grapefruit diet or something.  I remember that one.  You haven't, right?  Yeah.  Which half?  Which half?  Yeah.  Oh, sorry, guys. 
[01:41:30]  Amy's doing live jock-tober.  I like it.  It's true.  Oh, God.  What happened to me?  I'm going to do that a little more.  You almost don't have to do jock-tober today.  We got a lot of funny people in the studio.  Should we do another track there?  Let's listen a little more.  It's jock-tober.  Yeah.  Why not?  It's jock-tober.  We're looking at the Stan, Heidi, and Joe show on Maine's Classic Rock, 107.5 Frank FM. 
[01:42:00]  They go over a list of ways to remember things.  Oh, boy.  As if people can't just write a list.  That's helpful.  I put a pin in my clit.  That sounds very helpful.  Yeah, this is helpful, guys.  Three ways to remember everything or anything that you need to.  Number one.  This is the first tip.  Look, snap, and connect, the experts say.  This three-step method helps you create meaning, which leads to faster and more accurate remembering. 
[01:42:30]  Look, snap, and what?  I don't know.  Lip.  I wasn't listening.  I forgot how to remember.  Yeah, look, snap, and point.  What is that?  Look, snap, remember?  Connect.  Connect.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Nice.  I got a gold star.  So how do I look, snap, no, connect.  Look, snap, connect, or look, connect, snap?  Look, snap, connect.  Look, snap, connect.  Guys, if you just pay attention, you'll figure it out. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  Look, snap, connect.  I never remember a thing.  You girls.  I swear.  My tits weren't sewed on.  I'd leave them at home.  Just like my wife.  Now, now.  Now, now, Amy.  Look, snap, connect.  If I see a girl that I fuck that at the point and go, man.  Oh, God.  Faster and more accurate remembrance. 
[01:43:30]  A puker.  Hang on.  Yeah.  I'm looking at you, Heidi, right now.  Yeah.  Well, here's an example.  See, that's what I'm thinking.  I'm like, hmm.  I'm like, if I was just meeting you, I would look at you and say, your name is Stan.  Okay.  Stan.  And I'd snap and point at you.  Well, here's an example, guys.  This is how it works.  Okay.  Here's an example, guys.  This is horrible.  This is horrible.  Here's why.  He couldn't get to his example.  Like, they're trying to do a joke with him, and he's fucking, he's the example kid. 
[01:44:00]  He wants to get back on track to the example.  The example kid.  While fucking, that lady, while fucking Frances McDormand from Fargo is trying to fucking improv a little shit.  The monster is trying to get a joke in there.  Give her credit for that.  Who does her hairdo look like?  That fucking British hairdo is...  Cindy Lou who?  Cindy Lou Jew.  They almost look like Paius.  She almost has Paius coming down.  It's sort of a, um...  She has hair like Herb Tarlick from fucking WKRP in Cincinnati. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, it works.  If you have to buy, you go out to the store and you've got to buy eggs, you've got to buy stamps, and you have to buy shoes in one trip.  Eggs, stamps, and shoes.  Okay?  And you want to hit all three.  Imagine yourself...  I know how you remember it.  You put those three together.  Eggs, stamps, and shoes.  My wife wants to have kids, so I don't.  So I should put on my shoes, kick her in the eggs, and then stamp on her pussy.  Done. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, my God.  I'm not sure that's what they meant.  Oh, God.  I'm probably mistaken.  Imagine yourself holding a large egg with a stamp on it, and then watch the egg slip from your hands and break all over your shoe.  Right.  So you've the egg, the stamp on it, and then the shoes that it's falling down and getting off.  And then you look down and you're like, wait, what was I trying to remember?  And you're like going through like fucking people with memories, and you're like, no, that's not how I got it back out of my shoe. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, that's right.  It was the egg.  Because it looks like cum with yellow stuff in it, which would be hepatitis.  And then the shoes that it's falling down and getting all over.  Well, you're used to having an egg in your hand, right?  What?  Kill it!  I don't know what it means, but it's crazy.  What the fuck did that mean?  Well, actually, two eggs, and they're usually in an oniony smelling bag while I'm smoking a fleshy pipe. 
[01:46:00]  What the fuck just happened?  I don't know.  What the fuck did that mean?  It took a year off our lives.  Can we go to the end again?  I listen to that clip a lot of times.  What happened?  I don't know.  The music in the bed.  And then the shoes that it's falling down and getting all over.  Well, you're used to having an egg in your hand, right?  Can we call and ask?  Let's call and ask.  I think I know what it is.  For real?  Yeah.  I think this guy has cancer.  And the guy is making fun of the fact that he's always handling his tumor. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, that's it.  By the way, we've already hit phase three.  Phase three?  This phase is...  You guys have no idea what this is.  What's going on?  You've got to hit the computer real quick.  Yeah, you've got to reach over, Amy.  Yeah, let's just...  Reach around.  Yeah, reach around.  Give me the mic, stupid.  I'm hoping nobody...  Because a lot of times the fans, we don't want them to do this.  Five billion hits.  Wow, we went from phase one, phase...  I mean, wow.  They go to the Facebook page and they're kind of aggressive with it. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, no.  Are they their fans?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think it's their fans because we didn't tell our fans to go there.  We would never say that because that would be not nice.  It's not nice.  Oh, boy.  Yes.  Wait, is that the same people in this picture?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's the same girl?  Yeah.  Yeah, that pig is...  Yeah.  They've started blocking people.  They've closed down their walls.  All right.  Public people.  So we didn't get to see anything yet.  The normal.  Fuck.  Well, I mean, like, good morning.  We'll see what the comments are on good morning.  Do you want to check?  Yeah.  Where's the... 
[01:47:30]  Let's check because we could...  Oh, wow.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  What kinds of...  Oh, no.  Boy, Sam, I believe that's the N-word.  Yeah.  Welcome to Maine.  There's a picture of Sam next to it.  Somebody asks, is Stan the cuckold?  Look, you fat fuck.  Snap out of your fat streak and connect the gun to your skull.  I can't believe their fans are doing this.  Three is violent.  Yeah.  Yeah, it does get very violent. 
[01:48:00]  Yes.  Wow.  Resistance is futile shit dicks.  Phase three, phase three.  Stan looks like a bull prepper.  Phase four, they make believe they never had a Facebook page.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they just...  They take it offline.  Just take it offline?  Take it offline.  Oh, no.  I mean, this one, I don't even understand.  It says good morning, and the response is AIDS mouth.  Yeah, that doesn't even add up.  What is a bull prepper?  Why would they say that one of them looks like a bull prepper?  A bull prepper.  That's amazing.  Oh, God. 
[01:48:30]  Wow, I mean, now they're talking about Heidi's vagina.  Oh, guys.  We don't need that.  That's awful.  That's terrible.  I can't believe this is that type of show.  Why don't you...  Yeah.  Why don't you...  Refresh?  Refresh.  Okay, let me refresh.  We might be in phase four.  No, we're still in phase three.  Oh, okay.  Still in phase three.  I got wrong information.  I'm sorry.  Does it happen that quickly, like phase four will happen right before our eyes?  Yeah, it'll happen.  They deleted the posted video, by the way, too.  Remember?  Oh, we didn't even see what they said.  There was a video of that fat reporter, yeah.  That's right, yeah.  They deleted that video, because I guess they asked people to comment on it. 
[01:49:00]  I guess they didn't appreciate the comments.  Do you think the comments are unkind?  No.  Very supportive.  A lot of times they'll put really tasteless pictures up, which I don't know.  Yeah, yeah.  We don't condone any of this.  Nope.  That's terrible.  Never said to do it.  I do laugh at it, though.  Of course.  Their chemistry is amazing, though.  It's really good.  Back and forth.  The funny, witty little thing, the egg.  You usually have an egg in your hand.  I don't want to interrupt. 
[01:49:30]  Phase four has been achieved.  Phase four?  What?  Their Facebook page is gone.  No.  It just happened?  Three for three.  It just happened.  Wow, this is the quickest, I think.  Yeah, we only got three clips.  We've only thought about ten minutes.  Man of action.  We've only got ten minutes to jump over.  Phase four.  We are fucking assholes.  We will never.  It's just assholes.  We will never go to Maine.  No, it's done.  Done.  I hope you guys can't watch it.  What are you, a bunch of lobsters?  I don't know.  Why don't we do that?  Should we play another clip? 
[01:50:00]  Fucking shit, man.  Yeah, I guess.  I think when Jimmy sits there in the chip face for two minutes after he says something.  Relishing it.  Like his own fart.  You guys came in a little late.  You should have been here earlier when we played Hero Jimmy's 911 Call.  Yes.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Yesterday.  Was it last?  No, it was night before last.  Two nights ago.  Two nights ago.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  He was driving around and he saw one of those city buses.  It was 10-1-12.  10-1-12. 
[01:50:30]  He'll never forget.  One of the city buses.  And on the back, they got those lights that come on in an emergency that says, call 911.  Yeah.  Call police.  And he saw that and actually called 911.  And somebody, a listener that works down there, sent us the recording.  No.  I'm northbound.  I just thought he was.  You know what?  Was he really calling?  Yes.  I called.  He's a crime fighter.  I saw something.  He said something.  I was following the stolen bus.  For eight minutes.  Wow.  Eight minutes of concern before.  What a hero with a cell phone.  Eight minutes and then he gave up. 
[01:51:00]  And then he gave up after eight minutes.  Yeah, someone coming to his apartment.  He thought.  He thought cops were going to come screw.  He was screaming in the street that he was on.  Yeah.  Pursuing the bus.  They were going to lift him up.  Cover of the post.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Thank God for this man.  The mayor.  Key to the city.  Great.  Instead, I just wound up going home because nobody gave a shit.  No one cared.  The 911 operator could not be bothered.  You're going to have to play the 911 call again.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We will.  After Jock's home.  Of course.  Yeah.  Let's do another clip from Stan, Heidi, and Joe on Maine's Classic Rock. 
[01:51:30]  107.5 Frank FM.  A way to remember what song you're listening to.  They get into it.  They even reference if you have a smartphone, this is what you can do.  Does it involve an egg?  I hope so.  Don't we have apps for that now?  Shazam.  Of course.  We all know about Shazam.  Shazam.  What are they talking about?  They'll know.  It's Maine.  I don't know what they have up there.  That probably is.  Tip of the tongue.  You know who's jamming on the radio?  You know what band is jamming on the radio?  Jamming.  Jamming. 
[01:52:00]  Jamming on the radio.  He said it twice to make sure everybody knew.  You know what band is jamming on the radio?  I mean, everyone else is rocking.  I say jamming.  I'm a half cat.  Even Cousin Bruce, he's like, that term isn't used anymore.  Jamming.  What did he tell you?  23 Skidoo.  I know about jamming.  Anyone have an example of a song that jams?  Hubba hubba.  Anything by Fish.  Raindrops keep falling on your head.  Yeah.  That's a good jam.  We built the city on rock and roll. 
[01:52:30]  Yes.  Amy Schumer.  Right?  We built the city.  That's a great jam.  That's been your go-to lately.  That's my idea.  I love it.  Who do I play that to?  Oh, DeRosa.  Because he's wearing a denim jacket.  He's wearing a denim jacket.  This is your soundtrack.  I can't play it.  Just the beginning.  It's a lot of abuse for his clothes.  Oh, clothes.  Anything can cover those tattoos.  Yeah.  Someone called him Steve Austin or what's...  Oh, yes.  Six million dollar man.  Lee Majors.  Yeah.  Oh, Bill Burr.  Bill Burr called him Lee Majors.  He crashed him. 
[01:53:00]  Hey, Lee Majors.  Jesus, Joe.  Although, that's not the version of the song that is the better version.  Oh, well, we know.  Yeah, there is a...  My dick's all shitting.  Oh.  Oh, I love that.  My dick's all shitting from your ass.  My dick's all shitting.  My dick's all shitting.  And I will get stuck in your head.  My dick's all shitting from your ass.  This guy sells it, though.  It sounds like kids are singing it.  Listen to the guy sell the song, though, man.  He's all in.  Oh, yes.  This will be in my head for a fucking month now. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, no.  He never leaves.  Really?  Never.  Never.  It's your fantasy.  Oh, God.  Got it.  Got it.  Why can't you go me?  Is this boss?  Say you only take the car in your dirty face.  I like the subtlety of it.  Yeah.  I don't know where he's going yet.  You're really going to think it over.  Duty on my dick.  Duty on my dick, really?  It looks just like a black man's, but not quite as thick. 
[01:54:00]  Because it's brown.  It's like the harmony.  You're cool, eh?  Because I'm in your cold and cold.  Got a dirty handwork.  And my dick's all shitting.  Bring it home, buddy.  I'm in your ass.  Oh, my dick's all shitting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm in my dick's all shitting from your ass. 
[01:54:30]  I'm in my dick's all shitting.  Picture him in a headband.  I'm in my dick's all shitting.  Oh, guys.  Come on, Tom.  Is he jamming right now?  He is.  He's jamming.  He's jamming.  My dick's all shitting.  By the way, Amy, a lot of people are offering you a ride home today.  Oh, now.  Oh, thank you.  How nice.  How nice.  Oh, boy.  Let's get back to this, I don't know, how to remember a song bit.  Yeah.  Jamming.  Tip of the tongue.  You know who's jamming on the radio.  You know what band is jamming on the radio, but the name is escaping you. 
[01:55:00]  You're like, oh, my God, I used to love that band, and you're hearing something on Frank,  and you go, but I just can't remember what the name is.  You're hearing something on Frank.  Grab your smartphone or a piece of paper and jot down.  The station is the Frank.  Frank.  Frank.  Frank.  So, of course, you're listening to Frank.  You're not listening to some other station.  Right.  You want your band.  Yeah.  Or the multitude of other places you can get your music.  Or your fucking iPod.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You don't have to sell the station you're on all the time.  We're on a first name basis.  But then again, they're being very helpful here. 
[01:55:30]  I bet the program director was like, I really liked how you got the station in there.  That was a great choice you made.  It sounded very natural.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We need more of that.  Guys, I hate to interrupt, but how do you remember these songs?  I don't know.  That's why we're playing this, Tom.  You grab your smartphone.  So far, all I have is you grab your smartphone.  Yeah.  And hopefully you scroll to one of your cock photos, and you show the gal in the seat next  to you.  And you say, what song is this?  You go, but I just can't remember what the name is. 
[01:56:00]  Grab your smartphone or a piece of paper and jot down all the clues you're using to figure  out the name.  Grab your kite or your F-15 fighter jet.  A smartphone or a piece of paper.  Yeah.  That's brilliant.  Jot down the clues.  What the fuck is that?  Yeah.  Jot down the clues.  Grab this rock or this nuclear missile.  When was the last time you jotted down clues?  I've never, I've never, when you're figuring.  There's a beat.  Yes.  The chorus.  He sounds African-American. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, God.  And your smartphone or a piece of paper and jot down all the clues you're using.  And the last thing you see the guy write down is, wall.  I don't even know.  I don't even know.  I don't even know.  I don't even know.  Jot down all the clues you're using to figure out the name.  Okay.  Including specific lyrics of the song.  Okay.  The year you think it was released.  Okay.  Or the name of the year.  Look, if you don't know the song, you're not going to remember the year.  What about get a friend, cocksucker, and go, what's that song that goes da-da-da-da-da-da-da? 
[01:57:00]  Then he'll tell you.  What the fuck?  That's exhausting.  Get another friend who jots.  I think most radio stations now show you what's being played, right?  Jot down.  Even on regular radio?  Yes.  Just jot that down.  Jot down your jam.  Yeah.  The year you think it was released.  Or the name of the radio station.  Of the producer of the song.  The name of the backup musicians.  The studio bass player.  What type of strings he used on the guitar.  What the fuck? 
[01:57:30]  This guy's making it much too complicated.  This is a bit, Sam.  Where's the twist?  Yeah.  There is no twist.  We're like, ah, he's fucking with us.  Heidi even tries a little bit to give it a twist.  The moose?  He's like, no.  Oh, boy.  It is me.  It is me.  That was endearing.  Yeah.  Yes.  They love moose.  Of the radio station, which, of course, is going to be Frank FM.  Tip of the tongue.  Wow.  I can't even say it.  Tip of the tongue.  Tip of the tongue experiences are from your memory. 
[01:58:00]  That's already in there.  You just haven't retrieved it for a while.  You do know who that band is.  You just can't find it in, as Stan would call it, his filing cabinet.  Yeah, I got a filing cabinet in there.  That you've got in your head.  That's all.  When you see things sometimes on paper, it will come to you.  What's going on?  Holy shit.  They've talked about it so often.  Do you know how many times he's bored people at parties with this discussion?  You actually do know the name of the song.  I call it my filing cabinet.  All you're thinking is, it's my filing cabinet.  Drive drunk and get killed. 
[01:58:30]  That's all you're thinking about.  I'd just be like, yeah, I'm going to go grab a drink.  I'll be right back, though.  Yeah.  Hold that place.  Everyone leaves.  Yeah, everyone leaves this guy at the party.  You will look at him awkwardly sipping his beverage, looking around the room at everyone  who's left him.  And he's getting drunk thinking, fuck these motherfuckers.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The whole room looks like a daisy cutter was dropped on him.  Just fucking people spread away from him as far away as possible.  Oh, God.  When you see things sometimes on paper, it will come to you a little bit quicker than just 
[01:59:00]  trying to think of it off the top of your head.  That makes sense to me.  Yeah.  No matter what I have to do, because I have to remember a lot of things, I always do the  alphabet game.  Do you do the alphabet game when you dress up?  I do this when I try to think of an actress.  Who stole that?  N?  This can't be real.  It can't be real.  I think it's real.  It's the realest ever.  I do this when I try to think of an actress or an actor.  Does Al Shrug to have AIDS?  Reverend Al looks like a shrunken head. 
[01:59:30]  Oh, I hope he's sick.  He really doesn't look good.  He fucking got that lap band, obviously.  Oh, did he?  What?  He must have.  Reverend Al is so skinny now.  He's 58 today.  Oh, is he?  Not that he cares, but what a guy.  Maybe he's doing another hunger strike.  It's like they made an Al Sharpton doll out of leftover skin from Al Roker.  Tom Papa will be at the improv in Washington, D.C. tomorrow through Saturday. 
[02:00:00]  Nice.  Yeah.  And Tom Papa on Twitter.  I try to think of an actress or an actor.  Absolutely.  I go, A-E-T-T-E.  And it will trigger in me.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you'll think of the first or last name.  You'll get to the case and you go, Kate.  That's who that woman is.  Her name is Kate.  Blah, blah, blah.  You don't do that?  No.  Really?  I do that for songs.  I do that for actors.  I do that for movies.  People's name.  And it does work.  Absolutely work.  You're standing over your girlfriend going, what am I going to do right now, A, B, C?  It might come in your face. 
[02:00:30]  Does this belong on a morning radio show?  This is some of the most.  It's like that self-help shit.  Boring drivel.  There's consent for this stuff.  Who's the audience?  Who's the audience?  You know what?  It's every mom.  Just, just.  I said the other day.  Elderly mom who thinks that these are kids.  Did you hear the kids this morning?  I said the other day that the audience is from Fargo, Jean Lundergaard, the wife that 
[02:01:00]  got kidnapped, who's sitting there watching that morning show and laughing.  Ah, like watching Brainerd today.  In her mom jeans.  And she's just like, oh, that's a good one.  That's funny.  That's exactly the audience.  And eating dinner later that night.  Have you heard about the file cabinet?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, she repeats the things that they said.  You know, I got a handy way to remember things.  Yeah, I heard a funny egg joke.  I'm going to the Costco.  The people from the station are going to be there this morning.  Oh, God. 
[02:01:30]  They're signing mugs.  Ah, you know, just putting a face to a name.  It's fantastic.  Long-time listener.  Yeah.  She's skinnier than I thought.  Oh, you're a happy person.  You'll never hear that.  Wow, she's morbidly obese.  She doesn't sound such a fat pig.  That's true.  I didn't know you're so close to dying.  This is getting Irish, you guys.  Isn't it?  Well, shut off.  Well, there.  You're a moose. 
[02:02:00]  Should we continue with this?  Please.  Yes.  Have we heard about it?  Please.  I have to know.  Really?  Yes.  Yeah.  All right.  Another news story.  This one is fun for the whole family.  This clip illustrates exactly what you just brought up.  Like, you try to figure out who is enjoying this.  Like, why would you do this?  You tell me if you think this is appropriate for, like, a fun, you know, upbeat morning show.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fun for the whole family.  Right.  All right.  Watch it start off.  Andrea Yates.  Here's the deal.  A Connecticut man shot dead a masked man he believed was trying to break into his sister's home. 
[02:02:30]  Now, his sister lives next door to him.  So, his sister basically called him up and said, I think somebody's breaking in.  There's somebody outside the house.  Right.  So, he runs over, gets into the house, and as the person is breaking into the house, he  notices they're dressed in black, have a ski mask on, and a gun.  So, what does the guy do?  Shoots him.  Shoots him dead. 
[02:03:00]  Mm-hmm.  Takes the mask off.  It's his son.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  And now, here's Seely Dan.  Are we jamming to that song?  I think we're jamming to that song.  Yes.  You're down on the clothes.  Yes.  Amy Schumer is going to be in Pittsburgh.  Very good.  Pittsburgh Saturday in Poughkeepsie on Friday.  Nice.  Nice.  We've got a couple plugs going on here.  Oh, yeah.  It's a little confusing here, I think. 
[02:03:30]  Friday in Poughkeepsie at the Bardevon Theater.  Is that how you say that?  Sure.  Yeah.  And then Rex Theater in Pittsburgh on Saturday.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  I'm hitting my two favorite cities, same weekend.  Nice.  Lucky you.  We built this city on Amy Schumer.  Come on.  Wow.  It's going to be in my head forever.  Sam, they didn't have anything after that, huh?  Well, they did.  Oh, wow.  That was a little bit of a downer, but you can always count on Heidi.  What she does is she takes that story, and she's actually got a personal experience. 
[02:04:00]  It's just completely the same thing.  It relates.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It relates entirely.  You've got to do that on the radio.  Thank God.  You've got to relate to some of this shit.  She lets everybody know she's had to deal with stuff like that as well.  Oh.  Yeah.  All right.  I just can't imagine what this guy's going to go through the rest of their life.  Yeah.  I mean, that's, you know, you're suffering enough there.  But I've known people that have, you know, you're back over the family dog that's running  around.  That happens all the time.  Scared to death.  And the guilt, you've got to live with that.  I backed over the lawnmower once. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  My husband parked his brand new John Deere right behind my car.  Oh, it was a John Deere?  Yeah.  You can't run over a John Deere?  And I didn't know that he parked it there, so I backed up and kind of ran over the front end  a little bit.  That's not quite the same as murdering your own son with a handgun.  You stupid bitch.  Yeah, that's a bit of a drop-off as far as trying to relate to the story.  She has nothing to add.  One time I remember I burned the stake. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, yes.  Killed his son.  Yeah.  Yeah, really.  And equate it to your lawnmower with her bumper.  It was a John Deere, though.  Yeah.  I didn't know that he parked it there, so I backed up.  And kind of ran over the front end a little bit.  And then pulled forward and thought, what was that?  And she's got to live with that every day.  I know.  Yeah.  Every day.  Oh, boy.  Do you think that father is listening to this show right now being like, at least somebody  knows where I'm coming from?  Yeah.  I understand my pain.  He's been through it.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  And I didn't even know it was his lawnmower until he pulled the ski mask off and realized 
[02:05:30]  that it was.  The stupid fatso son.  Are we done now?  Well, I mean, you know, it's Frank FM.  Yeah, but we've got some funny people in the studio.  What phase are we still in?  I didn't know if you guys wanted to hear the frankly impossible question of the day.  Frank?  Of course.  Of course.  Because the station is Frank.  They have the frankly.  They don't do that.  They have to work in that Frank as much as possible.  I think the question of the day is, who married that Sasquatch? 
[02:06:00]  Do they give away like Franks?  Yeah.  Is that what they do?  I bet Frank is all over that.  Do you think that's pretty popular?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Frank giveaways?  Frank's friends.  I don't like that station.  Oh, Frank was better.  Oh, Frank was better.  We looked at a show yesterday.  They gave away, for their impossible question, whatever, they had some kind of trivia.  They gave away dinner at a, what was it?  Itchy Bon.  Itchy Bon.  Nice, right? 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  But you can only go on a Wednesday.  That's hilarious.  They said you could use this, but you could only use it on a Wednesday.  I love it.  A Wednesday night.  I like their other promotion.  They're giving away beer mugs, actually.  Oh.  Yeah, with African Americans on them.  And they call them the Frankenstein.  Oh, boy.  Hello.  Oh, boy.  Frankenstein.  It's a racist joke, kids.  Very racist.  Frankly, I'm offended.  I get it. 
[02:07:00]  I get it.  All right.  Why don't we do this, Sammy?  What is it again?  Frankly, impossible question.  Frankly, impossible question.  Jimmy.  Harvesthillfarms.com.  Or you can win a pair of tickets right now.  Just answer this impossible question.  All right.  Here it is.  USA Today says, if you play this game, you'll likely live four and a half years longer than  people who don't play this game.  I know what it is.  You don't play this game.  I know the game.  Cutting your dick off. 
[02:07:30]  Come on.  How do you know?  Turkey foot.  No.  That doesn't make sense.  Terrible.  Sure it does.  If you play.  So it says Monster Rain.  You can't play Monster Rain.  If you play this game, you live four years longer.  Longer.  What?  I guess Russian roulette's out of the question.  I was just thinking of it.  Come on.  That's crazy.  I'm going to guess it's chess.  For a show like this, that would be a good line.  Well.  You know?  That would get them out of here. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, yeah.  That's crazy.  What, Sam?  Sam?  You guys asked.  I think Tom just asked what phase we were in.  We thought phase four was the end.  Oh, yeah.  I'm just getting an update because we have people listening.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no.  Since the Facebook was taken down, they have not gone live on the air whatsoever.  It's been only music production and commercials.  Oh, my God.  And nobody is picking up the request.  Oh, no.  Oh, that conference room is smoking.  Oh, yeah.  The donuts are cleared off the table.  There's a PowerPoint presentation. 
[02:08:30]  Why are we affecting their show?  We've been attacked.  This is terrible.  What happened?  I mean, I will offer some radio play, but this is just.  You know, a good-natured ribbing of each other's shows is fine,  but this has just gone too far.  They should just goof on it.  Why would they?  No, that would not be good.  I need someone get me a shoe, a stamp, and an egg.  I'm going to war.  Four and a half years longer than people who don't play this game. 
[02:09:00]  What is it?  Can I take a guess?  Yeah, you can.  Cribbage.  No, it's not that.  No.  USA.  That's terrible.  Yes.  I would never get it.  Even if you said, what card game rhymes with bibbage?  I would never say that.  Yucky.  That's where she should have said Russian roulette.  Hey, what's the best edge to stick your cock in?  What? 
[02:09:30]  Can I take a guess?  Yeah, you can.  Cribbage.  No, it's not that.  USA Today says that if you play this game,  you'll likely live about four and a half years longer than the people who don't play it.  What is it?  How about poker?  No.  I didn't even know her.  Back in two minutes.  Hang on.  That's a closer.  You're going to celebrate.  You know a closer when you know a closer.  I was feeling a little bad.  I was feeling a little guilty when Sam just said that. 
[02:10:00]  And then now I feel great.  I feel wonderful.  That would take us out fucking high fives around the room.  He felt very good about his quickness there.  He was very proud.  You know we weren't going to top that.  If there's a God, they're having a meeting right now where they're all into a suicide pact.  Poker in the front, licker in the rear.  If there's a God, the meeting opened like this.  Look.  They're right. 
[02:10:30]  Want to hear that again?  Let's hear that out.  About four and a half years longer than the people who don't play it.  What is it?  How about poker?  No.  I didn't even know her.  Back in two minutes.  Hang on.  You know, because it's all fun.  Because it's all fun.  Hang on.  Hang on.  It's all fun.  Very casual.  Hang on.  Don't let you go anywhere.  Back in two minutes because he walks over to her and he starts hitting her.  You don't laugh at what I'm saying.  Back in two minutes.  Really?  Back in two minutes.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah. 
[02:11:00]  All right.  And he pushes the mic away.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wish you left a sweeper in there because you know it came in strong.  Frank Evan.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  That was bad.  That's it, I guess?  That was a doozy.  That was physically painful.  Yeah, it really was.  My stomach's still tight.  Uh-oh.  We got another communique.  Why doesn't E-Rock just read the communiques?  Why don't you hand them to Sam?  Um, oh, wow.  What happened?  They were in the middle of a contest.  This is from listeners in Maine. 
[02:11:30]  And they just started running a segment from last year without announcing what happened in the contest.  They're finished.  They're done for the day.  They were in the middle of a contest where they shut down everything?  There's no result to the contest.  What was the contest?  That I don't know.  Least entertaining radio show?  A moose ride.  You win a moose ride on the host.  Wow.  Death Con.  They're showing.  They're actual.  We just thought that Facebook gets shut down.  Their actual show.  Is this a first?  Yeah, I think this is a first. 
[02:12:00]  Which is, why are they shutting this show down?  What the fuck's rolling people?  Holy shit.  What's babies?  This means phone calls from them to...  This is crazy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Guess what?  We're not shutting down Jacktober.  Shut up.  That's exactly what we're trying to do.  Oh, boy.  I love Jacktober.  Oh, boy.  What if we get the ass out of all morning press from now on?  Yeah.  On the road?  I don't want to do anything tomorrow.  You're like, look, I'd love to do it, but they said no.  So they go to the phones to get the answer to that question, I guess?  Well, yeah, of course.  And we can't leave the listeners on a cliffhanger like that. 
[02:12:30]  On here, yeah.  Dan, honey, and Joe, what's your guess?  Scrabble?  Scrabble.  Scrabble.  Nope, that's not it.  What's your guess?  Good guess for it.  How about Chess?  Chess.  Chess.  Nope, not that.  These are all good.  Yeah.  Dan, honey, and Joe, Joe, what's your guess?  Is it Angry Birds?  Angry Birds.  Why are they laughing?  No, that's not it.  Dan, honey, and Joe, Joe, what's your guess?  Solitaire.  Solitaire.  Solitaire.  No, that is not it.  Hello, what's your guess?  It's golf. 
[02:13:00]  Golf.  You know, how do you know it's golf?  I know it's golf because I play golf a lot.  I've heard this before.  Well, USA Today says that if you play this game, you're likely to live four and a half  years longer than people who don't.  The answer is, indeed, golf.  That's nice.  I don't agree with that.  I'm usually hammered when I'm playing golf.  All right, Stan, honey, and Joe, Joe, congratulations.  Thanks.  Ooh.  Yeah.  They're jamming right there.  Back to jamming.  Def Leppard, right?  Def Leppard, yeah.  Nice. 
[02:13:30]  And we learned something.  That's a jamming song.  Yeah.  Wow.  That was fascinating, radio.  Yeah.  It really was amazing.  Oh, God.  And, of course, they announced the Frankly Impossible question.  They looked it up in USA Today.  So anybody who had a USA Today could have found the Frankly Impossible answer.  Yeah, it's not Frankly Impossible at that point.  No, you just need to get USA Today.  Everybody checking out of a Days Inn in Maine.  Yeah.  Well, there you go.  Jacktober for today. 
[02:14:00]  Enjoying the continental breakfast.  Jacktober.  Do you want another update?  Wow.  Another update.  Yes, you're on.  All right.  From people calling in, the contest that they were doing was wrestler nicknames.  Went right to music.  And the bit they're playing now is about a cancer benefit from last year.  Maybe that ties in with the wrestler nicknames.  Oh, no.  It's Lumpedo.  Lumpedo.  Old Puddin' Head McGillicuddy.  Oh, no.  It's Sad Tired Man. 
[02:14:30]  House.  Wow.  So they battened down the hatches here.  They went to the mattresses.  Why?  They could just do their show without taking phone calls.  We're not even going after their live show.  We're not going after their show.  Why would they panic like this?  We're not calling their show.  Maybe they were just humiliated.  They are panicking.  They were panicking that we were going to go after their actual show.  We're not.  We're not calling your show.  Yeah, by tomorrow we won't even remember you.  No.  That was a good Jack-tober, Sam. 
[02:15:00]  You enjoyed it?  Wow.  Who's tomorrow?  That was a delight.  I don't know who tomorrow is.  Is it time for Terry Clifford?  Un-fucking-believable.  You're really, I mean.  What?  Un-fucking-believable, that show.  It really is.  And the fact that they're going crazy over there now because.  The Facebook page.  Because of what?  We'll be back in two.  Stick it out.  You've got to be proud, though, you know.  Sit back.  Sit back.  Look at how you did it.  High fives around the room with that break. 
[02:15:30]  That was a good one.  That was a good one.  What's weird is it just came off the top of my head.  You know, let me tell you.  I wasn't even planning it.  How do you do it?  Oh, God.  You think the PD poked his head in?  Good job, guys.  Good job.  Oh, he poked his head in.  He goes, well, you make the big bucks.  That's what I was talking about in our air check meeting.  Yeah, yeah.  He's still air checks.  They've got to bring in, like, the show on a tape, and they go over it with the PD.  That was good, what you did there.  I like that.  See, that's what I was getting at.  Putting in Frank.  Just mention Frank.  During our last meeting.  As many times as you want.  You worked in the Frank thing perfectly. 
[02:16:00]  Look at Frank as a friend of ours.  He's a fourth jock.  Frank.  The station should be a fourth jock.  Oh, my God.  It's a person.  It's a personality.  He's your imaginary friend.  You want the listeners to think of Frank as their friend.  My wife was saying in the car the other day, she actually sees Frank in her head.  Yes.  Frank.  We live this shit.  Oh, yeah.  We had a PD actually go, okay, let's picture your typical listener.  And he had his yellow legal pad.  We actually had to sit there in his office, and we're like, I don't know, probably like 
[02:16:30]  a blue-collar, good blue-collar guy.  Yeah, yeah.  And they were like, female-ish?  No, no, no, no.  Not your audience.  Not female.  No.  And then we had to figure out, like, what?  How many kids?  What kind of car?  His annual income.  His annual income.  What he does on the weekend.  I'm like, what are we doing?  I'm like, what are we doing?  I didn't understand it at all.  I was brand new to radio, and I'm just sitting there going, this doesn't sound fun.  What was the point?  Why are you doing that?  So you could picture that person.  It makes you a better jock to your audience if you understand who your audience is. 
[02:17:00]  And then I think you wanted us to hang pictures of this person in the studio, so you're talking  to that person.  Find it in magazines or newspaper who you think your audience is, and put them up there, and  it feels like you're talking to them.  Oh, I put my John Wayne Gacy up there.  Pedophiles.  Is it Gary Glitter?  Me.  If I remember correctly, we had Ceterfolds in the studio when he walked in, like, oh,  you're just not taking me seriously.  Because we always just fucking busted his balls. 
[02:17:30]  I love the picture of you two quiet in a meeting.  It was terrible.  It was exhausting.  Staring at him.  I had no clue.  I was a fucking newbie in country.  I was the replacement in the nom.  Just all fucking green behind the ears.  My other favorite memory is...  What happened behind the ears?  Green.  It's not green behind the ears.  It's stinky fucking ears.  You're only green behind the ears after a few drinks, and you're in your yard.  I'm falling down on my lawn. 
[02:18:00]  Another meeting that was classic, we did a gay bit.  And it wasn't even that bad.  It wasn't that edgy.  No one believes you.  I swear.  This goes back when we were still trying to test the waters.  And a gay group gets involved, calls our PD, and puts a meeting together with us  in this gay group.  And they're handing out fucking brochures...  Pamphlets.  Pamphlets.  Oh, no.  And books to read.  Yeah, it was great.  And then this fucking...  The Last Unicorn.  It was about people that had to come out. 
[02:18:30]  Right.  And they had to come out, and how painful it is to come out to your family and friends.  And we were just making that much more difficult.  Oh, yeah.  And they wanted us to read books and stuff.  And then finally, the general manager stepped in.  Like, no, no, no.  The meeting's good enough.  You're not coming back so we could see what they learned from literature.  Yeah, they wanted to quiz us.  All of a sudden, you're in a book club.  It was unbelievable.  Oh, man.  And then our GM, because Bruce Mimmon, he was cool in the end.  He was very edgy himself.  He used to smoke pop to the listeners.  I don't think he wants his wife to know that, but he did. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  He had to act like the general manager with the tie.  And he would, like, scold us in front of them.  Like, I hope you guys are learning your lesson, boys.  They want to quiz us.  Right.  Like, I'm going to sit there and fucking, bam, what is amyl nitrate poppers?  Yes.  Yes.  What is breeding?  Do you remember what Bruce Mimmon said as soon as that door closed?  The gay group leaves.  Oh, he did say something like, well, I guess that takes care of the fegalas. 
[02:19:30]  Now, you go back in there and continue doing what you're doing.  Boys.  That's great.  As opposed to when we had to meet with what he called the shwoogies.  Yes, we did some kind of ethnic humor, and the shwoogies were upset.  Shwoogies?  Shwoogies?  I love it.  Really?  I love it.  This guy couldn't have been more than 5'4".  He comes in with a giant check, and he starts scolding us.  He's like, I'm supposed to be on the golf course, boys, but I've got to hand this check to the shwoogies. 
[02:20:00]  To the shwoogies because of your break that you did.  Sorry.  Oh, my God.  Giant check, because he was always going for the photo op.  He figured if he could get his face in the paper showing Boston he's doing the right thing,  that they would leave us alone.  Just looking around at the giant check.  It means I'm serious.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking love it.  We did those meetings, though.  We had a PD that goes, consider me the third member of the Opie and Anthony show.  He was the third member of the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, no.  This guy was the worst.  Should we?  The worst.  Probably worse than the guys that are around here. 
[02:20:30]  So what's happening in this meeting in Maine?  What's going down?  I bet you the big one is crying.  Yes.  They're consoling her.  Yeah.  They're just panicking.  They're panicking.  We probably just gave them a day off.  Just enjoy your day off.  We'll start fresh tomorrow.  It's like you're having your balls broken.  That's all this is, is breaking people's balls.  It's like, what fucking baby?  This is...  No.  In 2012, this is bullying.  This is absolute bullying. 
[02:21:00]  It's anti-bullying.  They are going to do...  It is.  Yeah.  They are absolutely going to do some kind of thing about bullying because of this.  It happens to everybody, though.  Everybody gets bullied.  Yeah.  It's not even bullying.  We were talking about that earlier.  It's like, at school, it's just, you get into arguments, you name call, you might even  get smacked in the head or something, but not everything is bullying.  No.  And maybe they'll go back to what they used to do.  Maybe Heidi will go back to riding tourists around the Grand Canyon.  Now that's bullying, Amy. 
[02:21:30]  Hey, man.  That's bullying.  You didn't learn anything.  Come on.  Oh, man.  That's mean-spirited.  Oh, man.  I thought that was really funny.  All right.  Listen.  Tom Pop is going to be at the DC Improv tomorrow through Saturday.  DCimprov.com.  Damn.  Very good.  Yeah.  Amy Sherman's got two plugs.  Friday at the Bardavan Theater, I believe, in Poughkeepsie, and then Saturday at the Rex Theater  in Pittsburgh.  I see theater next to your name now, Amy. 
[02:22:00]  I know.  But they're little.  They're not.  Nothing.  Nothing's changed for me.  They're like, they seat 80 people.  They're like, oh, you're in theaters now.  That's good.  Pittsburgh.  We've got to replay the 911 call to these guys.  Oh, I'd love to hear it.  The whole story.  I have a plug.  My special, Please Be Offended, is now on Netflix.  Yes.  Oh, I can download it on my iPad.  Yes.  So you can see it on Netflix.  But how are we going to remember that?  Oh, right.  Snap.  Snap.  Snap.  Point and jack.  Yes.  Put an egg in your mouth. 
[02:22:30]  Right.  And back your tractor or your son.  No, you're saying picture it.  You have to picture my face.  Yeah.  And picture still a half-empty comedy club.  And then go to Netflix.  Boys, you have to get a little more racially sensitive.  I'm getting a lot of phone calls.  We'll have a meeting about it at the chink restaurant.  Boys.  Oh, yeah.  I got about that, too.  Yeah, of course.  I took care of the yellow people.  Every time he wanted to scold us, he would take us out to lunch to a Chinese buffet. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  And I think his logic was they don't understand English, so I could yell really loud in front  of these people.  It's great.  I think that's what that makes sense to me.  And he could write off the buffet that he loves.  Yes.  And he was 5'4", and he had a giant car.  Remember?  We used to talk about how he would have to roll a rope ladder out so he could climb up.  That little guy.  He was adorable.  I do love Bruce Manny, though.  Can't reach the stuff in the back of the buffet. 
[02:23:30]  No.  Could you get some of the Moogoo guy pad?  I can't seem to reach it.  You've got to be nicer to the homosexuals.  Can you hand me an egg roll?  Yes.  Well, he's shoving in my rectum.  They didn't know how to control us, so then he decided if I drop my kids off.  We had to watch his kids while we were doing a radio show.  Oh, my God.  That's great.  No.  We've got to write the book for him.  His young son and young daughter would be sitting in our studios.  We were trying to do a show.  Edgy show.  Oh, so he figured, well, if I have a couple kids in there, maybe it'll calm them down. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah.  That is incorrect.  I don't remember how that worked out in the end.  I doubt that worked out well.  What the fuck are you doing?  We can't watch your kids.  Ew.  Unbelievable.  It's hilarious.  That's why we do this in October.  We've lived this shit.  It's great.  We've lived it all.  It's so great.  And like I said, I just never knew.  I was a construction worker who just got into radio.  I thought radio was all shits and giggles and nothing about media.  Like, that's what you did in a real job.  This was the fun job. 
[02:24:30]  And I'm sitting in a meeting with somebody yelling at us about what we talked about on  the radio.  I'm like, when did this happen?  Every break, we would open the door and our PD would be hiding in the shadows.  And he would start yelling.  And my thing was, I would just start openly laughing at him.  Because I didn't know what else to do.  I'm like, you know.  We recorded him sometimes and then incorporated it into a bit.  Oh, no.  Oh, can you play the Da Da Dave for these guys?  Oh, he just loved it.  All right.  Here's.  So, we.  Whatever.  So, you never took it seriously?  Like, you never had a moment where you were like, maybe he's right. 
[02:25:00]  Let's try it.  No.  Never.  I swear, not once.  We even knew you.  And not trying to be like, we're crazy, outrageous.  Don't listen to the boss.  Not once.  Not even like that.  Not once.  Awesome.  But we did not fucking, because we knew it was career suicide to listen to this guy.  With Bruce Midman, with Bruce Midman, we took him seriously at times, but not Dave.  No.  Right.  So, we did this gay bit and he calls up, he hotlined.  We haven't been hotlined in probably 10 years, but it was a big thing with program directors.  If they didn't like what you were doing, they would hotline you.  Oh, you'd see the hotline blinking. 
[02:25:30]  And you'd have to answer immediately.  Oh, shit.  And they would yell at you.  It's like, this is the easiest job in America.  Why are you yelling at me?  Right.  Right.  So, he didn't like the gay bit.  And play the phone call first.  Yes.  Hotlined you.  Hello.  Hello.  What's up?  I just wanted to...  Why are you on this line?  Well, I figured it was easier than getting out of my chair and coming down the hall.  Oh.  Just wanted to make a request.  Yeah.  Maybe we could steer the show in a little different direction so that this doesn't get out of hand. 
[02:26:00]  What's getting out of hand?  Well, I think we're going into the gay zone and we all know where that leads.  Yeah, we do.  We do agree.  Not really, but...  Pokey, pokey in the butt.  No, no.  Licky, licky.  That's fun stuff.  Yeah, it's fun, but you know what?  It's going to get us in trouble.  Just, you know, steer somewhere else.  If you keep going this direction, it's going to be trouble.  I'm just warning you.  Not from me. 
[02:26:30]  I'm talking about outside.  I'm cool.  I'm cool.  You've been down this road before.  The old dirt road.  Yeah.  A little heads up here.  All right.  Okay.  Head.  See you.  I guess the trouble we got into was being massive radio stars.  Becoming number one and he's long out of the business.  He sounds like the guy from Office Space.  Oh, he was.  Yeah.  I'm going to need you to go ahead and steer clear.  Steer out of the gay zone. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  We took his phone call and decided we needed to do another gay bit.  Yeah.  That's correct.  So instead of listening to it, we took his call, incorporated his own words into something  completely offensive.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah.  And this is what we did.  Wow, you were doing this right off the box.  Oh, yeah.  And this is what we put together.  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  Hello.  Going into the gay zone.  We're going into the gay zone.  Going into the gay zone.  Wanted to, uh, you know, pokey pokey in the butt.  Yeah.  Pokey pokey in the butt. 
[02:27:30]  Oh.  Gaze, gaze, gaze all.  You know, pokey pokey in the butt.  Yeah.  Pokey pokey in the butt.  Licky, licky, licky, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  Licky, licky.  Yeah, it's fun.  Licky, licky.  Yeah, it's fun.  Pokey, pokey in the butt.  No, really.  Da, da, da.  Da, da, Dave.  That's great.  That's awesome.  And he fucking was pissed about that.  Really?  That turned his face bright red.  Really?  Did he have a meeting?  Did he just come here?  Yeah. 
[02:28:30]  Really?  He'd open the door.  He'd fling the door open the second we went to commercial break, and his face would be red.  And he'd be yelling at the top of his lungs, like, pointing at us and yelling.  We're like, this is a fucking fun job.  We're just doing fucking dick jokes.  We're little angels.  Why are you so mad?  Dad.  Dad.  It was like that, man.  Oh, God.  Well, I think the conflict we heard over the years is that his wife hated us in the show.  I think she was a holy roller.  She was a holy roller, and she hates us.  So he got back, and that's the type of show on your station you allow them to do that? 
[02:29:00]  As he's fluffing up his pillow.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, we were going to go to break, but Sam comes running in and says, don't go to break.  And then he handed me a disc.  I don't even know what this is about.  Well, thanks fully to our listeners and not our worthless interns.  Oh, man.  Can't do a thing.  They suck.  Yeah, they're terrible.  But thankfully, our listeners have half a brain, at least.  Yeah.  Our show on Frank FM that we were just talking about, they did make an announcement about 
[02:29:30]  somebody hacking.  What?  Hacking.  What?  Somebody hacked their Facebook.  Maybe that's what happened.  Yeah.  Maybe it got hacked.  I can't blame us.  Maybe someone hacked their Facebook.  What do you mean?  They said it on air?  They went on the air.  That's the audio.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  I love interactive radio.  This is fun.  Is this a new phase?  A new phase.  A new phase.  Our Facebook page.  So, well, behind the scenes here at Frank FM, we don't know what is going on, but it looks 
[02:30:00]  like somebody has hacked into our Facebook page, and they've been posting very, what would  you say?  Graphic and disturbing photos.  Those are the ones you put up.  Yeah, that's just your profile picture.  You know what?  Maybe that's what happened.  Maybe that's what happened.  You're right.  Maybe that's what happened.  Maybe one of their fans hacked the Facebook page.  I don't know.  Could happen.  We didn't tell anyone to do this.  Very, what would you say?  Graphic and disturbing photos. 
[02:30:30]  Graphic photos, yeah.  And disturbing photos.  So, if...  Yeah, and I don't want anybody seeing them.  So, is there a way we can just block this or take it off?  Yeah, I think that what we're going to end up having to do here is...  Certainly don't want to bring attention to it and have everybody go to it right  now, because it's not a good time.  No.  Something's going on.  Yeah, we're basically going to shut down our Facebook page for right now.  That this doesn't continue.  And I have no idea who does this.  We've been hacked!  We have been...  Upsetting tens of listeners.  We're going to be giving away big-time wrestling passes right now.  That's right.  It's a pair?  Oh, my God. 
[02:31:00]  They know exactly who it is.  They're flustered.  Exactly.  And the PD came running in and said, you make an announcement.  You've got to make an announcement.  People are wondering what's happening here at Frank.  We have no idea who's involved.  I want to talk to Frank.  Where's Frank?  Frankly, this is out of control.  Bring up the calls again like you did.  Here at Frank FM.  She's crying in the conference room.  I just feel bad for Frank.  He doesn't deserve this.  It's a station, you dummy. 
[02:31:30]  All right.  It's a friend.  All right.  Wow.  This is exciting.  It's interactive.  It's good.  You do something, you get a response.  Right.  In Maine.  Yeah, in Maine.  It's quite amazing.  It feeds our egos.  We like that.  We're living in great times, bros.  We'll have another show tomorrow.  We're going to move on from these idiots.  Yeah, we're down with them now.  Can you give me a hint?  What's tomorrow?  I mean, I have a couple options to go to, but I want to wait until Fun Fridays when we 
[02:32:00]  bring back the old classics.  Fun Fridays.  Yeah, we like to look back at some of the other shows we've made fun of to see if they've  learned.  Yeah.  Oh, that's funny.  Yeah.  See if a year has taught them.  Have you ever noticed changes?  One year, we got into one guy's head so bad, he started like, remember that one?  Where he started going after the hole?  Yeah.  Does anyone else remember that?  We got so into his head.  You made them turn on each other.  Because we were speaking his language.  He believed everything we were saying. 
[02:32:30]  It's like, it finally got to him.  And he started telling her, shut up.  He started getting snippy with her.  Remember that?  Yeah.  You're the one to blame.  Where was that?  You remember that?  I don't remember where.  It's years ago at this point.  Yeah.  People are like, it's such like an event in the lives of these shows.  But for us, we do a different show every day.  Yeah.  I don't even remember who we did yesterday.  So we don't remember any of these shows ever existed.  Oh, no.  I do remember.  Ted and Amy and Syracuse.  But the first day, I swear I don't remember.  Me neither.  Maine is just right now fucking in turmoil. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, yeah.  The entire state of Maine.  Someone's hacked into their Facebook page.  It might be anonymous.  You mean posted?  Something happened.  Something happened.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Something happened.  Disgusting.  Disgusting.  Yes.  And we got to take it.  Is there a way we can take that down?  So people don't see it.  People don't see it.  Just put it up like you usually have it.  Who the fuck?  No one sees it.  So they didn't sign off?  They just went to, like, best of it?  They had to have it for the day?  They had an emergency meeting.  I would assume they're back on now.  Yeah.  You're right.  They decided how to handle it. 
[02:33:30]  They didn't take themselves too seriously.  All right.  More with Tom Papa and Amy Schumer.  Right.  Jim Norton's 911 call again.  Oh, I can't wait.  Just for you guys.  I can't wait.  Sirius XM.  This is the OPNN 3 Show.  Tom Papa in studio.  Amy had to leave. 
[02:34:00]  I know, man.  She didn't tell us ahead of time.  I know.  She's going to box.  Boxes.  Box.  I regaled her with some Twitter information before she left.  I told her that a lot of the people on Twitter want me and Amy to fuck.  And I told her that.  Yeah.  And she ran out of here.  Apparently she ran out of here.  Yes.  Specifically, she said she needed a time machine so she could go back to being 14 so she could fuck you.  Yes, she did say that.  That Amy is quick.  Frankly speaking, she is quick. 
[02:34:30]  And I like the fact that you're now using your multiple Twitter accounts to somehow say...  Hey, I think you should fuck Amy.  One tweet, one follower, one following.  But he gives himself away because they're all the same initials.  Who's Arnest Cunningham?  Who's Albert Campbell?  Oh, I get it.  Well, the Schumer, we should give her plugs one more time.  Friday, Bardavon Theater in Poughkeepsie.  Saturday, Rex Theater, Pittsburgh. 
[02:35:00]  Amy Schumer is blowing up.  And we're doing November 3rd.  Myself, Amy, David Tell, and Artie Lang.  Oh, that's right.  It's sold out.  Congratulations.  Look at you, Jim Norton.  And Mystic Lake.  No more tickets.  Whoa.  Where's that now?  Mystic Lake, Minnesota.  Can I go?  You can go.  You should follow Amy everywhere.  You'll receive a complimentary ticket.  Nice.  He's my gym buddy, so we take care of each other.  My gym buddy.  My buddy. 
[02:35:30]  I forgot my line already.  Is that from my buddy and me?  No.  No.  It's from my gym buddy.  Remember the doll, my buddy?  Yes, I do.  But that sounds like my buddy.  Very funny Hustler cartoon.  My buddy was a guy fucking the doll in the ass.  It was my buddy.  B-U-T-T-Y.  Hustler.  Fuck Playwood.  Hustler had the funniest cartoons ever.  Yes.  They were funnier than that Playboy funny ears.  And the old, broadened Playboy with his chest, saggy tans. 
[02:36:00]  Hooray.  What a hoot.  There was one Hustler one where Superman was sitting there with his pants.  His dick was out.  And there's a woman kneeling in front of him.  But her fucking head is in the ceiling.  And her fucking, like, his cum is coming out of her mouth.  And her head is severed from her body.  Pull her head off of the fucking load.  Dude, they were fucking racist.  Hilarious.  Trosley.  T-R-O-S-L-E-Y was one.  Billet.  B-I-L-L-E-T. 
[02:36:30]  Or Belay was another artist I remember.  They were fucking brilliant.  Dirty, but brilliant.  Oh, there's some of them.  Finally, I'll support you and say, we have the name of that show where they turned on us because of Jocktober.  Oh.  Do you want to know?  Yeah.  I would love to get the clip again because it was amazing.  What do you mean they turned on you?  Tommy.  We did Jocktober.  We pointed out all the flaws of the show.  And then it got into one of the guys' head.  And he started beating up the whole kind of thing.  Oh, right.  Brian and Philly.  Help me out. 
[02:37:00]  Hey, good morning, Hopi.  Good morning, everyone.  Welcome aboard.  Thank you, Jimmy.  It was Nicky and Amelia in Baltimore in 98 Rock.  The guy actually said he was a fan of the show and listened to the show on the way in to his job.  And he called into your show.  And then what happened?  Like, are they still doing radio together?  I believe so, yeah.  Oh, then he didn't learn, now did he?  Still got the whole.  Yeah.  They do sleep at her a bit more often.  All right, good.  Good.  They keep her in line. 
[02:37:30]  All right, Brian.  Thank you.  Here's how the show works.  Tom Papa's studio.  So Tom's been gone all summer.  Yeah.  It's good to be back.  I missed you fellas.  Yes.  I miss coming in here and seeing you guys.  We like having the Tom Papa on the show.  You guys.  Don't we want to play Jimmy's 911 call for Tom?  Do we?  Yeah, we do.  Yeah, yeah.  It's kind of fun.  Do we have to?  Yeah.  Really?  All right.  I'd love to hear it.  I'm embarrassed.  I'd really like to.  We're going to listen to the replay.  Oh, Jimmy. 
[02:38:00]  It's already in the can.  Was he really serious?  Was he serious on it?  Oh, boy.  Can we just play the very beginning then?  He knew he was alone?  Oh, I just want to hear the very beginning.  Oh, Jimmy.  Please, let me hear it.  I never planned on hearing this one.  Please.  Yeah, of course.  Jimmy was fighting crime for eight minutes.  Yeah.  That's the headline.  He's an eight-minute superhero.  He was all in, though, Tom, for eight minutes.  And I was just like, oh, fuck this.  But he followed this bus for eight minutes.  Oh, yeah.  A stolen bus.  Right.  Because my job is to help people. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  My job is to keep people.  Does he rock not have that?  Oh, okay.  You want the other thing, though?  Bring it up.  We got his theme music there, Tom.  Yeah, yeah.  Because he's a superhero.  For as long as it's convenient.  That's right.  He's a superhero.  That's pretty much it.  This brings it all together.  He's a empathetic man.  Convenio.  Convenio.  This is his theme music for eight-minute superhero.  Because I'm going to tell you something.  If this city isn't protected, this city will crumble.  Yes. 
[02:39:00]  And if no one stands up, then the city will definitely crumble sooner.  So it's my job to stand up.  And not only to stand up, but to fight.  And to fight for the little people who can't fight for themselves.  And to fight for people who nobody else will fight for.  And to go after people who, you know what?  I'm tired.  So all of a sudden, it's not fun or convenient anymore or exciting.  I need a massage.  Yeah, yeah.  He told this manic story two days ago.  And then it was like, well, then someone was waiting for me. 
[02:39:30]  So I gave up.  But for eight minutes, it was an amazing story.  And 911 operator wasn't being cooperative enough with Jimmy.  Jimmy wasn't approving of how they were handling this situation.  Cops weren't swarming in on the bus like it was Al Qaeda.  Where's the helicopter?  Yeah, it's the helicopter, too.  Tom.  So Jim just had it.  And we have listeners everywhere that got us the 9-1-1, the actual 9-1-1 call.  That's awesome.  As Jimmy's following this, quote, possibly stolen bus for eight minutes.  Cop went and got it.  I thought his bus was stolen. 
[02:40:00]  I like to give my location.  When I know the bus is stolen, I want to give a location.  You're a helper.  Just the beginning.  I love means well, Jimmy.  I love means well, Jimmy.  Just the beginning.  9-1-1, what is the emergency?  I'm on 10th Avenue northbound, and I'm behind a bus.  And the sign says, call cops 9-1-1 on the bus.  If it said jump off a bridge, would you?  I just said bus twice.  Bus?  It's the bus?  Something about a bus? 
[02:40:30]  I'm behind a bus.  It says stolen on the bus.  All right.  Get it?  Oh, oh, boy.  Yes, I just want to tell you, the wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round,  round and round.  Yeah, so you know that Lindbergh baby?  I haven't spotted him.  However, I have a double bus making a left on 57th.  Apparently a man of color is not authorized to be driving.  9-1-1, what is the emergency?  I'm on 10th Avenue northbound, and I'm behind a bus. 
[02:41:00]  And the sign says, call cops 9-1-1 on the bus.  On the bus.  It's number 5610.  It's the number from the bus.  We're on 10th Avenue, and it's crossing 47th Street.  It's the bus.  The bus.  Okay, so you said it's 10th Avenue, and it's crossing what?  47th.  No, we're northbound, and now we're crossing 48th.  That's all I've said with him.  I'm right behind this bus, but that's why I'm not excited.  Okay, so it says west.  Sorry, I'm just trying to get there.  You said it's 10th Avenue, west 47th Street? 
[02:41:30]  Yes, and now I'm at 49th.  We're northbound.  Fourth time.  He's already disgusted with her.  He's combative immediately.  That's the fourth time I said northbound.  Four times I said northbound.  10th only goes north.  But I should tell her, this is a pursuit.  Excuse me.  It's not a stationary call I'm making.  It's a pursuit.  Who would bother with this, though?  No one.  Jimmy.  Apparently no one opened.  Sorry, Jimmy.  Sorry.  You're right.  He's immediately teaching her how to count. 
[02:42:00]  49, 48, 49.  What are you talking about?  It's going up.  Send the fucking cavalry.  Now, we took out a lot of the pauses, but there's still a lot of long pauses.  Oh, really?  Because she's like, well, you just go home.  What is this?  She wants to say, just go home.  Just go home.  What are you doing?  Is it an NTA bus?  Yes, it is.  Bus number 5610.  Oh.  Bus number 5610. 
[02:42:30]  Which way, sir?  Northbound.  The only way you can go on 10th Avenue.  Right.  Now it's about to make a left.  We're on 10th, making a up.  Hold on.  Still going straight here.  Okay.  Still going straight.  Erroneous turn.  He tried to lose you.  Now he made a mistake.  Yeah, he fucked up.  He's chastising her for being a dummy, and he's like, making a left?  Nope, not making a left.  How bad do you want to talk to the guy driving the bus?  Because you know he has a different story.  Fuck, I think some creep is fucking following me.  He's on 911 to someone else. 
[02:43:00]  I'm being followed.  I'm just trying to do my stupid job, and some weirdo is following me.  Some kind of bus I'm on.  I'm driving a bus.  I think he's a skinhead.  He's a skinhead flashing his high beams at me.  He wants me to pull over and fuck him in the mouth.  It looks like it's going to make a left on 57th Street.  Doesn't care.  Doesn't care.  Doesn't care.  Doesn't care.  You don't think she cares?  She's like, on 57th Street? 
[02:43:30]  Yep, it's a double bus.  Five or seven.  Left on 57th Street?  Doesn't care.  Dealing with a murder on the other line.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  There's a suicide on the Empire State Building.  Someone's getting a busy signal right now as a robbery's in progress.  Right.  Sir, there's a woman being raped somewhere in the Bronx.  Right.  I would love to know 911 protocol, because it sounds like she can't say, look, go home.  Right.  I think it sounds like you have to stay in line with the person for a while before you 
[02:44:00]  could say, all right, look, we've got the info.  Thank you for calling.  Very good.  You see a bus.  Good boy.  Good boy.  Hey, it's a big bus.  It's got wheels, and it's got a light.  Oh, yes.  Oh, it's one of those double-decker buses, correct?  No, it's a double bus.  One after the other.  Oh, see, now he's just mad.  Now Jimmy's just mad.  It's a double bus.  No, it's not a double-decker.  Poor Jimmy just wants to be taken seriously.  I said it's an MTA bus. 
[02:44:30]  Right.  We already went through that part of it.  Exactly.  How many fucking times do you guys do the same thing, lady?  There's a fucking emergency happening.  Some nut was following me, Norton.  Now you see why Batman would just disappear for a while.  Right.  They shoot the signal up.  He's just not responding.  He's like, you know what?  I can't handle it.  I'm not dealing with this.  Jimmy Norton, crime fighter.  Yeah, I don't give a fuck.  Convenio, man.  When it's convenient to him, he'll be there.  Dun-da-da.  Dun-da-da-da.  Oh, it's one of those double-decker buses, correct? 
[02:45:00]  No, it's a double bus.  One after the other.  One after the other.  And we're headed towards 11th Avenue.  And it says call 9-1-1?  Yes.  Call cop.  Call 9-1-1.  Call cop.  I'm just getting the information.  Oh, yeah, no, no.  I know.  Oh, wow.  Oh, you short.  Jimmy's getting short.  But he's also still in the I'm hoping stage.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  That I'm not going to take care of something here today.  Oh, he puts it with the medals being put on by the mayor. 
[02:45:30]  He's aggravated that he can't hang up and call the post to meet him on 57th Street.  My victory photograph.  Yes.  Were you hoping for a victory photograph, Jimmy?  No police had been sent.  Were you hoping for flashing lights to appear?  Oh, yeah.  Just screaming in.  Screaming.  Jim's in there with the pursuit.  Thank you, sir, but we got it from here.  Yeah, the cop actually looks at Jimmy and throws him a salute.  Thank you, sir. 
[02:46:00]  John Q. Citizen.  Yeah.  And you drive home with a smile on your face.  And we couldn't have done it without Jim Norton.  Citizen.  That's why I gave my number.  I couldn't wait until they called me back.  Can you tell us what you saw?  Boss making a left.  Fucking boo.  Oh, God.  I love this.  Helicopter spotlight.  I'm just getting the information.  I know.  I know.  I know it sounds repetitive.  I'm just getting all the information.  I know.  And now I'm making a left on 11th Avenue, southbound. 
[02:46:30]  Still behind this bus.  Get it.  What's great is now Jimmy's going away from his apartment.  Yes.  He's off his route home, and he's now committed.  I'm now involved.  He's committed.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  What's your name?  James Norton.  N-O-R-T-O-N.  Oh, he's annoyed.  All right, sir.  Assistance will be there as soon as possible.  Thank you so much for calling.  I'm southbound on 11th right now.  Oh, God.  Don't hang up. 
[02:47:00]  Don't hang up.  Don't hang up.  Don't hang up.  Don't hang up.  I got to see this to the end.  Yes.  Where are you going, miss?  We haven't arrested the perp yet.  Why aren't you staying on the line with me?  Why aren't you giving me instructions to cut off the bus?  Yeah.  It's like the...  Jimmy looked at it like an air traffic controller cutting off the call to the guy that doesn't  know how to fly the plane.  Right.  Talk me down.  What am I supposed to do?  Keep my nose up? 
[02:47:30]  I know.  Flaps?  What?  Don't take the hint, guy.  Oh, Jesus.  Yes.  Don't tell the most important guy that he should just go home.  I'm on 11th right now.  Pulling up 55th Street.  Do you want to stay on?  He's passing a cop right now.  He's parked for a fire.  I mean, because of he turning.  Okay.  So the last course that he just passed by now, what is that on?  54th Street, Crossview, 11th, and 54th South Valley.  Why didn't you stop and tell the cop? 
[02:48:00]  And 11th.  I was busy.  All right, sir.  Thank you so much.  This is not how it went in the movie.  Yeah, exactly.  This is not how it went.  When Keanu Reeves was on the bus, there were helicopters, and tanks were coming and blocking  off.  So what were you expecting at this point, Jimmy?  Somebody to be interested in the fact that I had a crime in progress.  You hung up with 911.  Now what?  I continued following the bus.  Yes, you did.  Hoping to see police car.  I'm like, they've got to be on it.  You're like Superman.  What did you think was going on on the bus? 
[02:48:30]  I didn't know.  I thought there might be at first.  I was like, well, is there a hostage?  Yeah.  I didn't know.  Did you ever see 48 Hours where Gans and Billy Bear and Luther were in the bus shooting?  Shooting at fucking Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte?  That's exactly what Jimmy pictured us.  Sleepy bus just...  Nice gun.  Softly going on 10th.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sauntering.  No.  Old lady looking out the window.  I want to see if any buses have been reported stolen the last two days. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, we need to know more.  You're going to investigate this further.  Because it's humiliating if it was just a maintenance guy.  A follow-up to our earlier story.  You're hoping for a news story?  Like, maybe the bus...  See, I don't know why that light was on.  It's a call cough.  Maybe the bus had just been repaired and he was just driving it.  And then forgot to turn off the light.  Yeah.  Right.  Like leaving on a blinker.  Were you hoping for a news story?  A local news story?  Yes, I was.  A national news story.  Comedian turned hero, Jim Norton. 
[02:49:30]  See something, say something.  Yeah.  You know, I just knew something was wrong, man.  I saw that light and I'm like, you can't just go home.  He knew something was wrong.  And indeed there was something wrong.  Tom Papa, he called 911 back.  He called him back.  Why wouldn't he?  Yeah, he did.  This is important.  That's hilarious.  Oh, boy.  Because how many minutes between hanging up and calling back?  Seven or eight.  Following.  So you're following. 
[02:50:00]  So he continued following.  And he's like, what the fuck?  Where are the cops?  So he calls 911 back.  It's picking up passengers.  Yeah.  More people are going into the bus.  Yeah, I don't know.  There's some kind of conspiracy.  There's people gathering in the bus.  Where are you now?  Yeah, I'm in South Jersey.  Yes.  He made a stop at the Borgata.  Now it's headed northbound back on the parkway with a bunch more people on it.  These old people are boarding the bus.  They don't know what they're getting involved in.  Yes. 
[02:50:30]  Now I'm always.  Emergency.  Hi.  I just called and no one is doing anything.  She's like, you again.  Oh, brother.  Oh, boy.  I love Jimmy's voice.  And no one's doing anything.  No one's doing anything.  James knows he's on the line again.  Busy body Norton.  Yeah, it's a fucking busy body, chinless fat tits again.  Oh, fuck.  No one's doing anything.  No one's doing anything.  Dejecting.  Oh, God.  Jimmy's making weapons out of his spiral notebook. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, what do I use to stop this bus?  What do I have in this car?  Oh.  Now I'm always.  Emergency.  Hi.  I'm on.  I just called and no one is doing anything.  I'm following a stolen bus, I think.  Now it's definitely.  I think.  I'm northbound on the west side highway now.  Where were you before when you called?  On 10th Avenue and 11th Avenue.  It's a double bus.  And it's northbound on the west side highway. 
[02:51:30]  Now you're on the bus.  It's a cross and over.  34th Street.  We just passed over 34th Street.  I think he knows I'm right behind him.  But there's no cops doing anything.  He knows.  I think he knows that I'm following him.  Because I think it's a.  Yes.  He's looking at stolen bus.  I think it's.  Why does he know?  I love that.  I think it's.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a stolen bus.  Yeah.  It's a stolen bus.  And he knows I'm on his trail.  Yeah.  He knows I'm telling him.  He's.  We have gunfire.  He's shooting out the window. 
[02:52:00]  I'm basically saying he made me.  Yeah.  He made me.  He made me.  Let's remember.  57th Street.  Now he's all the way back down at 34th with the bus.  He's going back to the station.  Detective Norton.  Get in my office.  Get in my office.  I'll have your badge.  Well, you know.  Lieutenant.  I followed him and I made that left, LT.  Yeah.  You got to play battle rules.  I don't care.  That light was yellow, damn it.  Don't talk back to me, Norton. 
[02:52:30]  That big scene in the office.  You're going rogue.  Yeah.  He's going rogue.  But I had to talk without my hands-free device.  It was an emergency.  Hand in your cell phone.  Yeah, his cell phone and fucking some lubricant hits the desk.  And his sialis.  His sialis.  His sialis.  Hand in your condoms.  And that the original ones issued never used.  Fucking Jimmy.  I think this is better the second time. 
[02:53:00]  Yes.  It looks like a stolen bus.  Yeah.  Yes.  It's definitely a stolen bus.  The call cops thing is on.  But no one is doing anything about it.  So he's northbound now.  And he's almost stopped driving because he knew I was following him.  Oh.  What's the bus number?  I already gave him.  I don't remember.  I just passed him.  I'm sick of following him and no cops are coming.  I love that.  He's so angry.  What the fuck?  I'm trying to do something here for the good. 
[02:53:30]  I'm sick of following him and no cops are coming.  It's a stolen bus.  I passed him.  It's a stolen bus.  I'm the only one.  I'm out there by myself.  What number?  Fuck you.  I gave you the info.  I'm basically telling him they blew it.  That was me handing in my gun in bed.  Right?  Yeah.  You just...  Fine.  You catch him.  I've had it.  The system's broken, man.  You're like Serpico.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  There's just a chubby guy drinking his big gulp.  What is this guy doing?  I'm just trying to bring it back to the station. 
[02:54:00]  He's trying to lose him because he's thinking this guy's trying to steal my bus.  Right.  But he's got a double bus so he can't really make any maneuvers.  Right.  He's just got to go forward like a tugboat.  I think this guy's trying to steal my bus.  I want to talk to that guy.  He's so mad.  Wouldn't it be great?  Nobody's doing anything on you.  I'm going to follow him and no cops are coming.  I've been following him for 10 minutes.  But now we're passing 40th Street. 
[02:54:30]  But before when you called, what was the street you gave?  10th and 11th.  But then he came down 11th.  And now we went up 10th.  He's probably going to turn off because you're going to lose him.  But I can't believe I gave him a squad car in Manhattan.  Squad car.  You keep saying 10th and 11th.  But 10th and 11th are on parallel.  What street and 11th?  I know.  He was on 10th and then he went down 11th.  Oh, wow.  And then he went back up north in the 40s.  But now, right now, he just turned off.  Okay.  Forget it.  You know what?  Thank you.  He just turned off.  He just turned off. 
[02:55:00]  Okay.  Forget it.  Forget it.  Forget it.  This has all of a sudden become inconvenient for me.  I don't care what happens now.  If you don't care, I don't care.  I don't care.  Forget it.  He's acting all tough with really the guy just walking into a hot dog stand.  Yeah, yeah.  Never mind.  No, he turned off probably to go back to the bus depot.  Yeah, he probably did.  Yeah, he's driving.  He's going into a place called the Bus Hut.  The Bus Hut.  Bus Hut. 
[02:55:30]  To have his bus painted.  That is great.  Now he's hiding among all the other buses in this giant garage.  He's trying to lose me.  Playing the old shell game with the bus.  He has a garage full of stolen buses.  And he's even stolen an MTA sign and put it on the front of the building.  He's a genius.  All these people have stolen MTA uniforms.  We have to find the real bus driver. 
[02:56:00]  Find a naked man because this guy is dressed in a uniform.  Busting this case wide open.  Yes.  They even put it where the boats are supposed to be.  It's a place called Port Authority.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Wait, I think someone's stolen a subway train.  Yes, I'm looking up at stolen planes.  Stolen planes.  Jimmy's back in his apartment checking out CNN.  See the coverage.  Something's going to happen. 
[02:56:30]  Just waiting for the story to hit.  Maybe on the scroll.  Exactly.  But the one day when there was a U.S. airplane going into the drink, I'm like, no, no, no,  it's just a guy flying low.  No, shit, no, no, no, no, no.  Why call 911?  No problem.  That's awesome.  You are great.  That is, I love you out on your own adventure.  That's right.  Yeah.  Fighting crime.  That's what Jimmy does.  For 10 minutes.  Comedian.  10 minutes though.  Fucking radio personality.  Crime fighter.  That's right.  Convenio.  Convenio.  When it's convenient for him, he will be there. 
[02:57:00]  I think I see a stolen taxi.  Yes.  He's swerving back and forth.  His light is on.  As you hear his battle cry of, forget about it.  And they did.  They certainly did.  They couldn't have been happier.  Oh, they did.  They couldn't have been happier hearing you say forget it.  They probably went, finally.  She was so annoyed.  Where now?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now he's up 47th.  Where is he going? 
[02:57:30]  You should have tweeted that.  I didn't think of it.  Never fear.  Jim is going home.  I've had it.  Yes.  There's no need to fear.  Jim will drive by.  If it's on his way home.  Yes.  Here I come to sleep.  Here I come to check things out.  Then I'm on my way. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, Jimmy.  I love it.  It's great.  Not even enough time to put your cape on.  Not at all.  Sizing his doorman.  Did you hear?  Yes.  Oh.  That was me.  Poor Jimmy.  In other news, Jimmy, did you get your picture with Coach K?  Who's Coach K?  Yeah.  Coach the Olympics to their gold medal.  Where was he?  In the bathroom.  I peed right next to him.  Oh, I didn't know he was here.  That's so cool about this place.  All of a sudden, you go in for a leak.  Next thing you turn your head, you're like, what the fuck? 
[02:58:30]  Coach K right next to me?  I saw that guy.  I didn't know who he was.  That's Coach K.  That's Coach K.  I will say that in the next couple of days, there may be a couple of photo opportunities  for your pal.  Thus, then, why the new camera?  That's why I got the new camera.  Are we talking what?  I don't know.  No, I don't think presidents.  Talking dinero?  No, I won't say until it happens.  Oh.  Something around here? 
[02:59:00]  It's in the city of New York.  Oh.  It's a biggie, huh?  Possibly.  Don't know yet.  Oh, it's a big one.  Oh, it's a biggie.  Is it the one who Kidd was talking about?  No.  No, no.  I did a gig the other night in Santa Rosa, California.  I hate you.  And you would have, I was like, what would Jimmy do in this situation?  Take photos.  Barry Bonds, Ronnie Lott, Marcus Allen. 
[02:59:30]  Oh, boy.  Eric Dickerson, Joe Morgan.  And I just left.  Wow.  You just left.  Look at you.  What was the gig?  Not a photo.  It was a fundraiser thing.  Michael J. Fox charity thing and Ronnie Lott's charity.  Was Michael there?  He was not.  I was like, Jimmy would go nuts.  I didn't know any of those guys were really in the audience until it was over.  Did you do well?  I did do well. 
[03:00:00]  How much time?  An hour.  An hour?  An hour?  Yeah.  Damn.  Wow.  Look at you, Tom Pop.  An hour pretty clean, right?  Damn.  Yeah.  Gotta do that clean shit, huh?  If they wanted four minutes, I'd be happy.  You don't want to offend Joe Morgan.  No.  And his wife.  Was it a black crowd or mixed?  Mixed.  Very rich.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Black guys, blonde girls.  Yes.  When are you doing a Clint Eastwood gig? 
[03:00:30]  I don't know.  I don't know.  I've lost touch with Clint Eastwood.  What do you think of Clint Eastwood talking to the empty chair?  That's right.  You're pals with him.  You don't have to comment.  I thought it was hilarious.  I liked it.  Got the big debate tonight.  Everyone's got to be watching.  Yeah, it's a big one.  I think a lot of people are going to be watching this one.  Final Yankee game.  This fucking country's divided, man.  People are going to be watching.  Final Yankee game.  The big debate.  It's a big night.  Yep.  Yep.  And then I think I have to be in court. 
[03:01:00]  What?  Just to follow this up.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Witness depositions.  Jimmy's just showing up at the police station.  Is there anything you want to ask me?  Yeah, and I've had some reports on a stolen bus.  Yeah, we don't have one guy that works for the MTA that could call us and do a little  fucking...  I want that report on my desk!  I'm James Norton.  Crime hitter.  Yep.  James.  I've never heard James.  See nothing, say something.  See nothing, make something up. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, shit.  See nothing, make it into attention for yourself.  I'm a fool.  I'm a cock-sucking fool.  You just want to be taken seriously.  Yes, I do.  That's all.  Yeah, he's looking after the city.  You don't want to be taken seriously.  I was walking home from John's Hogg the other day, and there was a backpack leaning  against one of the signs on the side of the street.  Uh-huh.  Just leaning against there.  Oh, no.  And like, you know, kind of the dirt that's around the bottom of the front. 
[03:02:00]  Just throwing in the garbage.  No, so I walked, and it was during the UN shit that was going on, so there were cops  at every corner.  So I walked a little ways, and I stopped and just leaned against the building and looked  at it for a while to see if somebody was going to pick it up.  Good man.  And someone did indeed after about two minutes.  Oh, okay.  Then he yelled, ah, Akbar, and ran into a store with him.  He picked it up.  But any longer, and I would have gone to one of the cops and said... 
[03:02:30]  If you didn't wait, you would have shut down the city for a couple hours.  Exactly, so I didn't want to...  You would have been that guy.  You would have been the guy.  Yeah, yeah.  So I assessed the situation.  Very good.  Good.  Good job.  For a little while.  Actually, I was hoping some fucking, you know, Muslim extremist would have picked it  up, and I would have been able to rattle a few shots off at his head.  That's right.  Ah, you know.  I'm packing.  I'm packing heat, motherfucker.  Look out.  See something, shoot something. 
[03:03:00]  Some poor guy just came, picked it up, got back in his truck, and drove off.  Right.  Yeah.  There went my fantasy of fucking heroics and medals, and they like jimmies.  This is like the Avengers in here.  It really is.  The Avengers.  We are terrible.  Everyone's got these delusions of grandeur.  Oh, God.  Yeah, we all want to be heroes.  The pretenders.  Don't we?  Yeah.  We're the pretenders.  We're the pretenders.  Oh, yeah.  Stolen buses. 
[03:03:30]  We care to a point.  And we just don't.  Are we working Monday on Columbus Day?  I don't know.  Is that a company holiday?  Oh, it's a big holiday.  Is that a company holiday, Sam Roberts?  I don't think.  If you're Italian.  Let's say.  I am Italian, and I say, we are taking the day off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ah.  Hey, you should.  Hey.  Hey.  I don't think it's a company holiday.  That's a big holiday, though.  It's a big one.  It's not.  It's a big one.  It's really big.  Kids are off from school.  Yeah, they celebrate that racist that came over and killed people. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah.  He messed with the Indians.  Man.  He wasn't here before.  He shouldn't be celebrated, man.  They're kind of right.  He wasn't the first.  Think of what was going on back then.  The guy got in a boat and came across a fucking ocean of horrors.  They're kind of right, though.  And it was like, you know what it was back then?  The beginning of Monopoly.  Where you just buy shit up.  That's what the world was back then.  Except they were stealing it.  But that's just it.  But then after everybody has their shit, then you've got to make negotiating deals and play politics. 
[03:04:30]  At first, you're just like, gimme, gimme, gimme.  No, no, no.  Here's what happened.  What?  This is like when you land on Marvin Gardens and there's a hotel and you go, cool, look what I found.  No, no, no.  But I already own Marvin Gardens.  No, no, no.  I got this.  I got this.  You can't possibly say that the explorers, the people that took ships and didn't even know what was.  And wore clothes.  Right.  Machinery.  Shoes.  Fucking navigation.  Things like that.  Don't forget about the monsters in the water.  Monsters in the water. 
[03:05:00]  Those fucking sea serpents.  Flat Earth.  And did that.  They deserve to do a little conquering.  Fair enough to submit, though, that they conquered.  And who's to say they wouldn't have gotten their ass kicked by the people that were here?  Well, specifically because they had guns.  Okay.  And the people that were here did not.  Yeah, exactly.  They didn't have any.  Sorry.  But I'm just saying, say it was an invasion.  No, it wasn't an invasion.  It was a conquering of people.  Yeah.  But not in vain.  It was like coming to a land with wild animals on it.  Right.  But he didn't know anything. 
[03:05:30]  There were no roads.  Right.  There were no buildings.  Exactly.  Nothing to show they own this place.  I'm happy we did it, but I'm just admit what Columbus did.  I'm not saying.  We were the first terrorists.  Explorers.  Man.  Explorers and conquerors.  Yes.  They did conquer.  Civilized people.  But conquering back then wasn't like it is now.  No.  Yeah.  It was just you went and you conquered.  You were like, you had a few beers.  They took.  No harm, no foul.  Right, Anthony?  Took what didn't belong to them.  Hi, 911.  Yeah, there's a guy in this big golden helmet and he's harassing the indigenous people. 
[03:06:00]  Could you please send somebody?  Yes.  Where are you?  I think he's an invader.  Some cut.  Wait.  Yes, he's invading.  He's invading.  He's got one horse tied to the other and I'm right behind him.  No, there's three ships.  The Nina Pinta and the Santa Maria.  I told you already.  Exactly.  We made a left in Ecuador.  I told you.  Ah, forget it.  Ah, forget it.  Yeah, forget it.  All right, enough.  Let him die. 
[03:06:30]  Forget it.  What could these people possibly do?  Yeah.  I'm going to ye old pub.  Ah, whatever.  No harm, no foul.  You think there were a lot of ye old pubs?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Ye old everything.  Ye old.  Ye.  You got to visit ye old Smithy.  I got to go.  They really fucked up with that Manhattan deal, didn't they?  Yes, they did.  They really fucked up that one.  25 bucks?  Yeah, they didn't really see the potential of this island.  Not this rock.  You know why?  There's water everywhere.  Because it was nothing until the people that conquered built shit on it. 
[03:07:00]  The Indians were not going to be.  You weren't going to see fucking the Empire State teepee.  It wasn't going to be there.  Fucking giant fucking teepees and wigwams.  I live in the wigwam district.  It wasn't going to happen.  I just don't like the fact that they give Columbus credit for discovering something.  You've got to give him credit.  How do you not give him credit?  You've got to.  Coming halfway around the world.  They thought the world ended.  They thought he was going to go over the side.  But you can't discover something where people were already living. 
[03:07:30]  Not people.  Oh, please.  I love agreeing with Tom Poppins' sarcasm.  Tom Poppins being sarcastic.  I'm like, yes!  Finally, they understand.  Finally, some of the things like me.  Savages.  No more important than the buffalo.  Just admit what he did.  Wild savages.  He did exactly what happened back then.  It wasn't bad back then.  It was.  No, it wasn't.  Everyone knew it was wrong.  It was doing business back then.  It's always bad.  No, it wasn't always bad.  It was bad when Rome did it, when Alexander the Great did it. 
[03:08:00]  No, it really wasn't.  That was what was accepted.  It was the way of life.  It was progress.  Well, for the people doing the conquering.  For the people being conquered, it sucks.  Sometimes people went in to conquer, and they didn't conquer.  They got their asses handed to them sometimes.  That's true.  It was a risk.  And there was a risk just getting on those ships and coming over.  What's that?  There was definitely an inherent risk in doing that.  Absolutely.  But when you come over and you see an indigenous people, and they don't have the technology 
[03:08:30]  or weaponry to fight you off, you can take their shit.  Indigenous is another word for gross.  Gross and really not as civilized.  Which is what I agree with you, but that's what happened, so we should at least say that's  what happened.  I don't mind that definition.  I don't think anybody knows that that didn't happen.  What did they think happened?  Because they're saying, because they're giving Columbus credit for being a guy who discovered  a land, and they're putting, they're not addressing it with the harshness and with the reality,  like what you just said. 
[03:09:00]  He discovered it for the Europeans.  He came here.  Discovery is all relative to the term, I mean, things that have been discovered have been  there.  And he wasn't like a, he didn't come in with guns blazing either.  He just sailed up on the boat.  I'm sure he got off the ship.  People act like he got over the machete and just started hacking.  The front of the fucking, the front of the Santa Maria came down, he came out like Saving  Private Ryan.  Right.  Get him.  Engines with fucking machine arrows.  Right.  The bottom line is he just had a beret and got off the boat. 
[03:09:30]  We're taught in school, Columbus discovered America.  That was what we were taught.  Not Columbus came here, found people living here, and then they were conquering.  Which I'm okay with.  It is what it is.  And it was over a long period of time.  It wasn't Columbus's guys, his henchmen taking out a whole continent.  I tell my children that Columbus discovered America for the good people.  Yes.  Right.  Thank you, Tom Popper.  Finally.  You know how when you flush, the duty goes away?  That's thanks to Columbus.  They don't build sweat huts out of it. 
[03:10:00]  Right.  Exactly.  Enjoy your takeout.  There's some logic here.  It's not an invasion if they didn't know people were already there.  Right.  Right.  They didn't know anything.  That's right.  They knew nothing about the...  Right.  They thought it was empty.  They thought.  When they realized, what's the thing when you walk into a house and you realize someone's  living there, you just leave.  You don't just sit in.  If only they could have built houses, we would have taken that town.  Yeah, exactly.  They were a little behind.  They were just swinging from the trees.  We had to help them along a little bit.  They didn't know.  I mean, the art, the culture, the architecture, the transportation, everything that was going 
[03:10:30]  on in Europe at the time.  You're just upset.  When you came over and thought you were going to see that, if you saw that, it would be  a little hard to think, oh, well, now we've got to get war and we've got to conquer  these people.  But when you just see some people dragging around shit, you know, you didn't even have horses  until the Spanish came over, it was crazy.  You look from your boat and there's an Indian making out with a turkey and you're like,  you're like, why?  Who cares?  It's just like, you know, let's build some roads. 
[03:11:00]  We're not going to take the whole thing.  We're just going to push them west a little.  And you also looked at it like we're helping them.  We are.  We're going to teach them how to live.  God, I love how Tom Papa actually knows about this stuff.  It's the truth.  Very good.  It's the truth.  He speaks the truth.  He speaks the truth.  Tom Papa's going to be at the DC Improv.  Yes.  Starting tomorrow.  We've got someone waiting for us outside.  I see.  Tomorrow.  I see that.  We've got to leave on time.  Oh, really?  The big hunt show.  Do you guys have a meeting today?  Not really. 
[03:11:30]  Do you guys have a meeting?  I think, boys, the Shugis want to talk to you.  No, I think we're just going to shake some hands.  We'll meet.  Pat each other on the back.  Oh, that's nice.  Job well done.  Tom Papa's going to be at the DC Improv tomorrow through Saturday.  Good to be back and see you guys.  Yes.  Yeah.  Very cool.  Yes.  We'll have you back soon there, sir.  I've seen Tom Papa, though, recently a couple of times.  Yes, socially.  Parties.  Socially.  We were partying together.  Parties.  Things like that.  Yeah.  Nice, nice.  Hanging out.  Two men. 
[03:12:00]  Similar ilk.  Follow Tom Papa on Twitter, please.  P-A-P-A.  Tom Papa.  Yep.  What do you got?  Hang on.  All right.  Oh, by the way, tonight, I will be simulcasting the debate on Live from the Compound.  So tune in.  Oh, boy.  The debate on vodka.  Yes.  And I will be drinking.  So it will be fun.  What time does that shit start?  9.30, I think.  Is it 9.30?  Yeah.  See that bombshell stuff they had on Obama?
