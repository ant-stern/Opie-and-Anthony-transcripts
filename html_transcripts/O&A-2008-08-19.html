<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts' usual banter, focusing on Jimmy Norton's unappetizing oatmeal and Anthony's belated glee at Jimmy Durante's death.  The conversation then shifted to Norton's mustache and his upcoming facial hair removal.  A significant portion of the show was devoted to the Olympics, specifically the hosts' crude and sexually charged commentary on the physiques of female athletes, particularly in beach volleyball and discus throwing.  They analyzed the attire of female athletes, speculating about the relationship between increasingly revealing outfits and television ratings.

The multi-million dollar divorce settlement of Phil Collins was another major topic, with extensive discussion of his three divorces and the substantial sums paid to his ex-wives.  The hosts speculated about his prenuptial agreements and made numerous jokes about his appearance and personality.

A news story about an elderly woman assaulted in an elevator segued into their "which way is north" segment, advising listeners to avoid engaging with strangers asking seemingly innocuous questions. This led to listener calls, discussion of Gary Glitter's release from prison, a lawyer suing Columbia University over its women's studies program, and an Australian mayor encouraging unattractive women to move to his town.  A Matthew McConaughey beef commercial was briefly criticized. The segment concluded with a discussion about a man with a diaper fetish, setting the stage for the next segment.

The next segment heavily featured discussions of adult baby diapers and related fetishes. The hosts recounted a previous guest appearance by a large man in a diaper with a dominatrix.  The conversation then veered towards online searches for "adult baby" images, followed by a news story about a 31-year-old man, "Boy Diaper," arrested multiple times for wearing diapers and exposing himself to children. The hosts expressed disgust and anger at the man and his mother.  This was followed by a discussion of disturbing videos submitted by a listener, including graphic beheadings and self-immolation, along with a caller describing a video of Bjork's stalker's suicide attempt. The discussion then turned to collecting historical artifacts, specifically Nazi memorabilia, sparking a debate with callers about the ethical considerations of such collections.  A book detailing the whereabouts of various historical body parts was also mentioned.  Dr. Bodden was briefly mentioned as a previous guest.

The following segment began with a discussion about Napoleon's penis size, transitioning to a news story about parents complaining about overly sexy children's clothing,  and then to Disney merchandise, specifically a line of girls' underwear with the suggestive phrase "Dive In." A caller from Baton Rouge discussed the show's removal from local radio stations. The hosts then played audio of a 1996 incident involving a Björk fan who mailed a bomb to the singer and committed suicide, followed by a discussion of their mandatory and ironically serious FCC training. More calls followed, including one from a listener in the Army complaining about excessive online training.  The conversation then turned to Björk's music and, finally, to the show's interns being barred from the studio due to corporate policy, leading to frustrated exchanges with staff.  The segment ended with a mention of a news anchor seemingly saying "cunt" on air.

A significant portion of the broadcast focused on crafting a humorous, assertive email to Sirius XM CEO Mel Karmazin proposing eliminating the intern coordinator position to increase the hosts' salaries, using highly offensive language.  This was followed by discussion of the end of the Mike and the Mad Dog show on WFAN, playing clips from their final show and mocking Mike Francesa and Chris Russo's on-air personas.

The final segment opened with insults, a discussion of the Iraq War, a rant against "IMHO," and a humorous anecdote about Cindy McCain sustaining a handshaking injury.  They then planned a "silly time sweeper" segment, including crude humor and discussions of violent acts. The McCain injury was revisited, leading to discussion of creating a "bleep game" for the audio. Commentary on Norm Macdonald's performance at the Bob Saget roast followed, along with descriptions of other comedians' crude jokes.  The show concluded with a "line of the day" segment featuring sexually suggestive and offensive listener submissions, further banter, insults, and a frustrated exchange with a staff member, "Y-Rock," due to a botched sign-off.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Phone number 877-212-O-N-A.  Wow.  Ah, you know how I know it's a wonderful morning.  I'm smelling Jimmy Norton's...  No, not that.  I'm smelling Jimmy Norton's oatmeal.  Wonderful maple syrupy smell that's wafting around the studio. 
[00:00:30]  Just wonderful.  Choke on it.  You're eating the worst food on earth.  I mean, I like oatmeal, but that oatmeal sucks a big one.  Yeah, Ope tried that once and he didn't find it as enjoyable as Jimmy Norton did.  You can caulk your bathroom with the stuff.  Caulk?  Caulk!  Oh, okay.  It's dry. 
[00:01:00]  Sorry.  It's thick.  It is very viscous.  It's one of those foods you have two teaspoons of it and you're completely full.  It's sacrete.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  How's everybody this morning?  Very well.  I'm a little tuckered out.  Tuckered out?  It's still hard to sleep.  Is it?  Because of your schnozola?  Well, you're sitting.  We call him the old schnozola around here now. 
[00:01:30]  Who are they calling?  Oh, Jimmy Durante.  It was the old schnozola.  What a douche.  I'm so glad he's dead.  Oh, good.  I'm so glad he's dead.  You and your nose.  Get out of here.  You're famous for your big nose.  He's been dead 30, 40 years.  But now you're finally glad he's dead?  It just hit me.  It just hit you.  The joy of his death has just come upon me.  When did Jimmy Durante die there, stunt brain?  Stunt brain?  And you're still sleeping, sitting up, I'm assuming, there, Jimmy?  I will be for a while, yeah.  Oh, God.  I was scared. 
[00:02:00]  I thought you were going to shave your mustache overnight, but I'm very, very happy that you  decided to continue the look.  Oh, yeah.  I love it.  But don't cheat.  You've got to shave the rest of your face today.  Yeah, I'm going to.  All right, good.  Oh, so everything else clean shaven?  Yeah, of course.  So the mustache stands out more.  Of course.  Yeah.  It's even more obnoxious.  That is.  Your mustache!  Yeah, people are digging the mustache.  You know, the girls like it.  Of course they do.  We lost Mr. Durante in 1980.  80?  The music lingers on in car commercials.  A cha-cha-cha-cha. 
[00:02:30]  Oh.  A dinka-dinka-doo.  Oh.  Shut up.  Oh, is he horrendous.  Can the coffin.  There's a Michael J. Fox movie where Kirk Douglas plays his uncle.  Yeah.  And he's pretending like he's an old rich.  Uncle and Michael J. Fox.  Michael J. Fox plays a paint shaker.  No?  Oh, that might have been a newer movie.  It's horrible.  It's not even five after.  I know. 
[00:03:00]  It's horrible.  What was that?  Oh, that was the music in E-Rock's head.  Danny does it and E-Rock gets blamed.  No, he just had it on.  Ah, cha-cha-cha.  It was, uh, the cue was up a little loud.  That's all.  Let's hear what you were finding there.  How was he famous?  I don't know.  Holy Jesus.  This is when they really hated black people.  Oh, boy, did they.  Wow.  Once upon a time, they sang the Vodio Doe. 
[00:03:30]  The Vodio Doe.  But that was long ago.  Yeah.  Everybody started into boop-boop-a-doo.  Ew.  They got tired of that, you know.  Oh, that's terrible.  Oh, no.  That's terrible.  That's just awful.  Wow.  They're critiquing him now?  Oh, wow.  Yeah, of course.  Of course.  But in a Michael J. Fox movie, not where he plays the painshaker.  Right.  That was the hardware store Follies.  And, uh, he's trying to curry Kirk Douglas' favor. 
[00:04:00]  And, uh, Kirk Douglas was a, uh, was a, uh, they just make him do Jimmy Durante as a kid.  So now as an adult, he keeps doing Jimmy Durante, Kirk Douglas.  Somebody else will remember the movie, and he keeps taking his hat off, going like,  rah-cha-cha.  Stop it.  It's so awful.  No one's going to remember that.  Awful.  No, somebody will remember it.  Wow.  Is it called Greedy?  Greedy, yeah.  Thank you, Snubber.  Greedy.  Wow, you're, you're earning your name today there, sir.  Wow. 
[00:04:30]  We're putting him to work.  Woo!  A painshaker.  Just amazing.  Hey, Michael J. Fox, I need a raise.  Anyone, uh, watch the Olympics last night?  Oh, is that still going?  Oh, my God.  Oh.  Geez, I missed that.  Just not into the Olympics this time around?  No?  Eh.  What about that?  You know what the odd thing is?  I'm more into the Winter Olympics.  Well.  I like the, uh, the, uh, the big ski jumping. 
[00:05:00]  The Winter Olympics are more.  I like the snowboarding.  Uh, more of a rock and roll type of a thing.  Yeah, yeah.  They kind of, uh, got a little more of the X Games vibe to it than, uh, than the Summer  Olympics.  The Summer Olympics, very stuffy, very traditional and boring.  Yeah, but the girls wear less clothes in the, uh, Summer Olympics.  True.  A lot of, uh, the toe of the camel.  Why are they wearing, like, uh, bikinis to pole vaults?  Where did that start?  Whoa.  Now, why am I not watching this?  I'm not complaining, but it seems that they've, uh, drastically changed the outfit since the 
[00:05:30]  last Olympics.  And how they use the pole.  Right.  Which is even more interesting.  I think they just started, uh, shortening up the shorts until eventually it got to be  where, uh, they wear the bikini bottoms, just like the marathoners do now.  Now, you missed the, you missed the point.  They started shortening the, the shorts until the ratings got to a place where they're like,  okay, short enough.  Yeah, well, there was a big controversy over the vacation of why are the men wearing shirts  and long shorts in volleyball while the women are wearing bikinis? 
[00:06:00]  Yes, I'm very upset.  That's where it came from.  How did you know?  So I can't get enough of that beach volleyball.  Oh, it's the best.  And we've won what?  These two girls have won 107 consecutive matches.  Uh, Misty, whatever.  Misty May and Carrie, whatever.  Now, I haven't been watching, but I have noticed something.  Smokin' bodies.  Ugly.  Smokin'.  But, uh, a little, a little, uh, I don't know, tranny on the faces.  Although when they wear their sunglasses, it covers up a world of hurt. 
[00:06:30]  And then they take the sunglasses off for the interview and you're like, uh.  Put the sunglasses back on.  Yeah, they need those huge cataract sunglasses.  Really?  This Carrie Walsh is what, 6'2"?  Yeah, 6'2".  Her body is ridiculous.  Yeah, they're also giant girls.  All of them.  And they went up against a, I think it was a Romanian team where the girls, both of them  were over 6'2".  One was 6'4".  Really?  And they almost lost that one set.  Really?  Yeah.  Really?  Really?  That's what they sounded like.  I gotta tell you another thing. 
[00:07:00]  I watched for literally seconds the, uh, the woman's, uh, discus throw.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Seconds?  Seconds.  They are the ugliest women on earth.  Discus.  They are beasts.  Oh, yeah.  Did you see them?  Yeah.  And who goes into the discus throw?  Yeah.  Like, uh, you wanna try out, uh, well, they're opening discus.  One of the, it's like, what do you want there, uh, honey?  Discus or the shot put?  Right.  One of the discus throwers, uh, she was a huge fan of, uh, Mary Lou Retton growing up. 
[00:07:30]  Really?  Oh, I bet, huh?  Wow.  A real big fan?  It's like she ate Mary Lou Retton.  Wow.  In which way?  Jimmy, look at this body.  Her face is, uh, eh.  Her face is average.  What is that?  All right, that's a, that's a nice ass.  This is, this is Kerry Walsh.  Yeah.  They're gonna win the gold medal.  I don't care.  Although now I just freaking jinxed it, but they're gonna win the gold medal.  They haven't lost a match in, uh, over a year. 
[00:08:00]  Last time they lost was in Boston.  Got my Olympic, uh, trivia last night.  Just taking up wasted space in my brain.  Yeah, she, she does, uh, she does look good.  How about a face shot there?  Doesn't matter what her face is.  No, I mean you.  How about a face shot on me?  Anything?  You don't need to ask?  Just, just, I don't need to ask.  Just go tie my shoe and pretend you're yawning.  It'll happen.  Uh, her face is irrelevant.  It could be a billboard for diapers. 
[00:08:30]  It's so banger.  She just turns around and there's no human face.  It's a diaper and.  She really does have a, uh, nice, uh, ass on her.  But she figured out the sunglasses to make her face look way better.  Oh, yeah.  There's a problem there.  Wow.  She looks like Larry Bird.  She really does.  Yeah, she.  An ugly Larry Bird.  Body's ridiculous, though.  Yeah, they are, uh, they're in shape, I guess.  Yeah.  To be in the Olympics.  By the way, uh, Stunt Brain's getting a little abuse. 
[00:09:00]  Uh, Stunt Brain.  Uh-oh.  We haven't won 100 matches in a row.  They have won 100 matches in a row.  Ah.  That's Matt B in California.  You're one of those guys.  People don't like the win.  I'm one of those guys.  When your team wins, we gotta congratulate you like you were on the field with them, right?  Exactly.  Yeah.  I have pride in my country.  Yeah.  Hmm.  But you're not, uh, on the team.  No.  Those are our girls, though.  Our girls.  Can you get a picture of the, uh, the, uh, the disc throwers?  I'm sure, I'm sure you're not gonna get a lot of results if you Google that.  Ooh. 
[00:09:30]  You Google, though, beach volleyball, man, you could, you could be looking at pictures  for days.  They gotta be walking around just from the back, people going, holy jeez, that's fantastic.  Yeah.  Then they turn around, whoa.  How is beach volleyball a sport?  Yeah, it really took off, though, a few years back.  You see some of these, these other sports?  Yeah, exactly.  This one, this one, they should, actually, they're getting rid of baseball.  That's insane.  Why?  Because the rest of the world doesn't play it.  That's why.  Europe doesn't play baseball. 
[00:10:00]  The Olympics are all about Europe.  It is kind of dull for, uh, the Olympics, too.  You know?  Yeah.  Baseball's not the fastest-moving, most exciting game.  How long did they have it for?  Was it always there?  Uh, no, it wasn't.  Since ancient Greece, when they played naked.  No, they...  Uh, and held the bats in a strange way.  Swing-ba-da.  She's one of the hot ones.  Danny's trying to find, like, pictures of discus throwers.  She's one of the hot ones, believe it or not.  Really?  I can't even describe this beast I saw last night throwing the damn thing. 
[00:10:30]  Because it would turn into an Ima situation, I do believe.  Beast.  Oh, really?  Oh, just a...  All right.  Just a beast.  I understand.  Just a beast.  Oof.  That was all that was our last night was the beach volleyball, right?  Yeah, they...  That's it?  Well, on some of that dumb track and field where the guys don't really run that hard because  they're saving it for the finals.  That's like the new thing.  What?  You don't really get exciting races.  All they have to do is come in, like, uh, the top four positions. 
[00:11:00]  So, you know, they start coasting.  That's the one I saw last night.  Jesus H.  Christ.  Who is that?  That's the one I saw last night.  I do believe.  Wow.  I do believe.  I thought that...  I thought this was just open to people.  What happened?  Wow.  Look, I didn't say anything.  I'm just saying.  I was wondering what she did when Gimme a Break was over.  Oh, wow.  She's awful.  Holy mother of God.  But they could throw that discus.  Discus.  They're good at throwing the discuses. 
[00:11:30]  Why don't they just call it a disc?  They have to go to the Greek discus.  It's a discus.  Unbelievable.  And then hot female wrestlers.  I wasn't watching.  What?  What is this guy doing?  How am I missing the Olympics, then, if all this is going on?  Well, the pole vaulting started yesterday with the bikini bottoms.  That was terrific.  That I got to see.  Picture, Danny?  Comment?  Comment?  And all the...  What? 
[00:12:00]  Look up Alicia Sacramone.  Who is she?  She's a gymnast.  I didn't think she was...  Oh, yeah?  She's the one with the huge neck.  And she's the one who stumbled twice.  Is she the blonde?  She's one of the blondes who cost us the team medal.  Oh, cost...  Okay, not the Russia Ruschki one.  No, that's Nastia Lukin.  She ain't too bad.  She's one...  She's all right.  Oh, yeah, this chick was all right.  I don't mind that.  What the hell is that?  That's a little too much muscle going on in the thigh area.  Alicia's Sacramone looks a little bit like Jessica Simpson. 
[00:12:30]  Let's go to Mike in Smithtown.  Mikey.  Mike?  I want to go to Mike.  What's going on?  How are you, Mike?  Believe it or not, they had girls on trampolines.  That was one of the events.  Not a sport.  Not a sport.  What did they do?  They just jumped up and down and did splits like the old man show.  Like the man show.  I kid you not.  I called my wife and I said, put on the Olympics.  And she goes, well, I don't want to curse, but that's what she called me because I was  watching it. 
[00:13:00]  The sport is not the girls jumping.  It's the guys watching.  It's who can repaint the ceiling the most effectively.  They're just the inspiration for the sport.  If you put them in bikinis, the Raiders will go up in four years.  Believe me.  Well, NBC's having a massive problem because everyone was watching Michael Phelps do what  he did.  He's going to be on the cover of what?  Sports Illustrated?  With all of his medals a la Mark Spitz.  He did the shot?  He did the Mark Spitz pose.  The money shot?  He did the Mark Spitz pose. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  It didn't look like the Mark Spitz pose, though.  He should have done something else with his dumb medals.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was just a little weird and stuff.  You know, the Mark Spitz pose was done in black and white.  It wasn't a color shot.  Really?  Yeah, it's very odd.  And then what?  Then they hauled him out to England because they were afraid because he was Jewish and  they had the little problem there.  So they moved a lot of our Jewish athletes out of...  Where the hell was it that year?  Munich.  Munich.  Yeah.  1972. 
[00:14:00]  Munich.  Oh, nice.  Oh, what is that?  The pole vaulting in the bikini?  Yeah.  All right.  Look at Danny go.  Getting a lot of help here.  Brad Miller from Port Jefferson.  He says, Ope, show aunt the Russian pole vaulter that won the gold.  She's effing hot.  Let me check out that other shot you just showed because I want to see that.  You know something?  I'm not going to say anything, but I think someone maybe like Olivia Newton-John would  do good in that sport because I'm looking...  That's the one? 
[00:14:30]  This is the American who trashed...  Would knock that pole down.  Not how they go over it.  All right.  This is our woman who trash talked the Russian, and the Russian lady said that inspired her  to beat her.  I must break you.  That's the hot Russian pole vault?  Whoa.  This is the American.  This is Gene.  That's a pole vaulting pose?  Jesus.  It looks like tub girl.  You've got to get into the tub girl position to get over the pole.  I guess so.  So, the Olympics are all right, but the second week of the Olympics, they don't know what 
[00:15:00]  to do because there's no more Michael Phelps for the world to watch.  He's done?  Like, that's it?  Yeah.  He had the best week ever.  They ought to stretch that out.  You know that dumb show on VH1?  Best week ever?  Well, there you go.  He had the best week ever.  He should be the guy.  Who had a better week in the history of the world than Michael Phelps?  Seriously.  Yeah.  He won that many golds.  The guy's money went up.  He's going to be making $40, $50 million next year. 
[00:15:30]  He had the best week ever.  Name a person that had a better week in the history of this world.  I'd love to know what Mark Spitz made in endorsements back then because it was probably in the tens  of dollars.  He probably hit a million.  You think even that much?  Maybe.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What did he endorse?  Is he dead?  Pools.  No.  He's going to be on the CW 11 this morning.  He's got some...  Mark Spitz?  Yeah.  Mark Spitz is...  Wow.  I mean, Olympic coverage, worldwide coverage. 
[00:16:00]  And Mark Spitz, man, how bad is his life gone?  Oh, he's on the CW?  Oh, Jesus.  Now he's on the local news here in New York doing a little something-something.  He was bitter, wasn't he, about something he was snubbed?  Well, he was known as an a-hole.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Most people say that he was not a nice guy.  Wow.  At all.  Was he a fruit?  No.  No.  The diver was the fruit.  Seven what?  Greg Leighanus?  Yes.  In a two-year period.  He made $7 million in a two-year period. 
[00:16:30]  Seven mil back in...  Is that 1972 dollars?  It's saying in 1972 he came back to the U.S., got some endorsement contracts, earned $7 million  in a two-year period.  Wow.  Not bad.  That's a lot of money.  What's he even better about?  Yeah.  That translates...  He was bitter about not being invited or something to watch...  This year?  ...the swimming competition, like in VIP passes.  You know how at PNC, when we get friends that want to get backstage passes and they get  cranky because they don't have it?  That was Mark Spitz. 
[00:17:00]  Well, did Mark Spitz have to go through Club Snow to Kenny?  Yes.  I'm sorry.  I got you lawn seats to watch the diving.  But you don't have a wristband.  Well, Kenny, they're my brothers.  It's like, what are you doing?  Well, maybe Mark Spitz should have called his travel agent and got a little ticket for  the Olympics in China.  Just a side note about that $7 million that Spitz made.  Yes.  It's saying here that $1 million in 72 would be equivalent to more than $10 million today.  What? 
[00:17:30]  So, he did quite well.  He did very well.  I don't understand how that works.  Ooh, back to school clothes.  Too sexy.  We'll tell you after the break.  Oh, a tease.  Absolutely.  And stupid Phil Collins lost another $46 million.  We'll explain why.  Sure?  Yeah.  Because he's a douche.  We'll explain why after the break.  Opie and Anthony just getting started.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:18:00]  Remember that interest instrument being in there.  How stupid is Phil Collins, huh?  Very.  This is a topic that gets Anthony very excited.  Ah.  Extremely excited.  I love when people decide to throw money away multiple times.  You've got to give everyone the one shot. 
[00:18:30]  Give everyone one.  You get yourself married.  Things go a little awry.  And you lose a crap load of your money.  Phil Collins did it three times.  And this last wife got 48, just about 48 mil.  What the hell?  Wow.  Any writing credits on any of his albums?  Well, this is why you'll never get married again, right, Ant? 
[00:19:00]  Exactatickatackly.  You'll do the one.  Or you did the one.  I did the one.  And that's it.  That's it.  It sucked.  Sucked.  Well, Phil Collins just doesn't know how to learn a lesson.  I don't know.  I'm doing some quick math here.  His first wife took him for, it looks like, about 4 million.  About.  4 mil, the first wife?  Unless I got this wrong.  She's got to go back.  Then the second wife took him for 34 million.  Mmm. 
[00:19:30]  The third wife, which is going down, it's in all the papers today, is going to get 46 million dollars.  Holy Jesus.  He has doled out 84 million dollars in divorce.  In wives.  In divorces.  How difficult is he to live with?  What the, yeah.  What a dope.  84 million.  And his third wife is 35, he's 57.  So he had a little chippy.  22 year difference there. 
[00:20:00]  Relatively speaking, a chippy.  And for the people that are keeping track at home, yes, he is paying more than Paul McCartney.  Wow.  Yes, officially this is the biggest divorce settlement, the biggest celebrity divorce settlement ever.  This is Sue Sudio.  Ah, there it is.  Did she help write this?  Is that what happened?  Yeah, that's what we don't understand.  Because I don't understand why he had to shell out that much money to an ex-wife. 
[00:20:30]  I don't get this.  Well, let's break out the Genesis albums.  Yeah, well, look at the writing credits and see if any of his wives are on there.  Yeah.  And this, as Jim said before, his wife's name is Sue Sudio.  And she stuttered.  And they would say, what's your name?  And she would go, Sue Sudio?  That's brilliant! 
[00:21:00]  Oh, what a dope fellow.  Looks like the wives are taking his advice and Sue Sue Sueing.  Sue Sue Filio.  Right.  What a jerk.  Sue Sue Dopeio.  What an ass.  He really is a dummy.  Three times.  Just a dummy.  How bad was his prenup?  Yeah, and if you get taken the first time, and then especially again the second time,  why the third time when you have a prenup?  How long were they married this time? 
[00:21:30]  I don't know.  It's probably a really bad prenup.  He's like, if we don't get along, you only get $35 million.  They were only together for six years.  Oh, my God.  What kind of money was he making in the last six years?  He did some of those Disney or Pixar.  Oh, right.  He had some of those hit songs and those cartoony movies, right?  Oof.  Who's his lawyer?  Master Poe?  I would just settle.  Give it to us.  Sorry.  One of the wives he divorced or broke up with by fax.  He sent her a fax and said, it's over. 
[00:22:00]  And I think that hurt him in the divorce hearing.  And just to clarify, because there are a couple messages coming in,  it was the biggest divorce payout in British history,  because I think we've had a couple bigger here in the States.  That's far as celebrities go.  Yeah.  Because this is a celebrity.  Okay.  What is it?  I thought he was like slamming some broad on CBS News or something.  Dana Tyler, I think.  Yeah?  We are a couple.  Yeah.  There's rumors that he's been dating her.  Well, because they separated like two years ago.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  And he did get rid of one of his wives by fax. 
[00:22:30]  That's just.  By fax?  That just.  McFly!  That just proves.  No, I'm divorced.  No.  That just proves how stupid he is.  By fax?  You want to keep her very calm when you're like ending the marriage  knowing she can take you.  I'm going to send her a facsimile.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's smart.  He sent her a link to beatitbitch.com.  Probably had some shock jocks to it.  Hey, can you call my wife? 
[00:23:00]  No wonder he's got that hairdo.  Three wives?  Because he's got one hair left on his head.  Yeah.  That one little hair that he combs back in the middle.  Yeah.  What's leaving faster, his hair or his wives?  His wives.  Give me a close one right to the end.  Oh, buddy.  His bank account is like the wound in Kennedy's head.  It looks good from one side.  God, that's awful.  He's just dumb, dumb, dumb. 
[00:23:30]  Great.  Just shave that dumb thing on the top of your head.  Enough already.  It's a little straight.  It looks like a stripper's landing strip.  Enough already.  One of those stripper do's that they use.  I think he got transplants just to make that little weird thing at this point.  That thing is really staying, isn't it?  Because it's his trademark, I guess.  Holding on for dear life, that weird little thing.  What do you call it?  It's like four hairs wide.  Four hairs wide that goes all the way to the back where the rest of the hair still grows.  Where the rest of the hair is.  It still grows. 
[00:24:00]  It looks like the mark a dog makes on the rug when he comes in, when he scoots.  And he does a little scoot on Phil's head.  Yeah.  Phil Collins had no prenups in any of his marriages.  So he didn't even learn when the second one took him for $34 million.  He should have learned after the first one took him for $4 million.  The only way I would justify number two and three is if his first wife got $20,000 in a divorce.  He'd probably go, yeah, I got it made.  Yeah.  Smart for these bitches. 
[00:24:30]  I want to be the responsible one on this radio show and just acknowledge that there was a savage attack in an elevator.  Another hat removal.  Yes.  There was another hat removal.  I just want to go on record and say that it's a terrible thing that happened before this gets a little out of control.  Oh, it was horrible.  It's on the front page of the paper.  This guy, he's got a thing.  He likes to kind of strangle old ladies in elevators. 
[00:25:00]  He put her in the sleeper hold, brother.  Yeah.  In an elevator.  He gets in there.  They're just standing quietly like people do in the elevator.  And as they start going up or down to the way the elevator was going, he grabs her by the throat and just starts choking her out.  And she's wearing a, it looks like she's ready to go to the Kentucky Derby.  She's got an Easter hat on.  She's got her Oprah Winfrey hat on.  Yeah.  What movie did Oprah wear that? 
[00:25:30]  Oh, is that The Color Purple?  Or Beloved?  One of them.  I don't know.  Here's the same movie.  Here's the story.  The more you see, the angrier you get.  Really?  Surveillance video, the elderly woman rides an elevator with a man who waits to attack until her back is turned.  Other cameras in the building catch him running to freedom with a woman's purse and cane.  85-year-old Lillian France was mugged last Thursday afternoon on her way to visit her niece.  The Guyanan-born retired Garmin District seamstress is recovering from severe neck bruises, cuts to the face, and lacerations on her cheeks and the roof of her mouth. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, that's terrible.  Oh, no.  That's terrible.  That's just awful.  That's her cheeks.  The psychological damage runs deeper because the mugger never seemed threatening before he struck.  A mugger.  He played the old woman.  He pretends to be friendly, asks her what floor, presses the floor for her.  All right.  This is...  Sorry.  But this is exactly what we talk about.  Which way is north?  This is exactly what we talk about. 
[00:26:30]  Well, we haven't explained which way is north in a while, so when you find folks out there that want to visit New York City.  Any urban city, I believe, around the country.  But in New York, we've noticed if somebody comes up to you and asks you what time is it, which way is north, run.  Run for your life.  Run!  Because if it's a nice summer day out and you hear, excuse me, which way is north, and you go to point, you will feel a huge meat fist hit the side of your face. 
[00:27:00]  You'll hear that ringing noise for a split second.  And then you'll regain consciousness to snow outside and Christmas music playing because you will have been unconscious for months.  For a long, long time.  Run!  So what happened here with...  Yeah, he was in the elevator, and I guess he started up some chit-chat with the woman, acting friendly, and maybe inquiring to which floor she's going to. 
[00:27:30]  It was the floor of the elevator, apparently.  How dumb is she?  Chit-chat in an elevator.  No one does that.  No.  If someone starts talking to you in the elevator, you should just turn and go,  What do you want?  Stupid Bob Kelly does it.  Yeah, I know.  I hate friendly Bob in the elevator.  Oh, is he just annoying when he does that?  Hi, I'm Bob.  What's your name?  Here's our which way is north thing.  Yeah, which way is north?  Oh, well, let me see. 
[00:28:00]  It's rockin' around Christmas tree at the Christmas party hop.  So there was some chit-chat in the elevator.  Yeah.  See, and she's all friendly.  Yeah.  And then the guy just chokes her out.  Leaves her on the floor of the elevator with her chapeau laying next to her.  How she's looking around in this video, you know she's like, Oh, dear God.  I'm in trouble.  Oh, dear God. 
[00:28:30]  She's just looking at that door praying that it opens up.  And there's some savior on the other side of it.  Where's my floor?  Where's my floor?  Oh, and then she turns it back.  He joins the door.  Oh.  And there it goes.  Yeah, that's what I took her out, brother.  He does a classic wrestling sleeper hold on her.  Yeah.  I was walking up from Starbucks yesterday, and there was this weird little guy, Puerto Rican  or Italian.  He walked up to me as I was walking, and he starts engaging me in a conversation. 
[00:29:00]  Trouble.  Nothing but trouble.  And walking with me.  And I'm like, What?  What do you want?  Yeah.  But usually that, when you're very abrupt with people like that, like, What?  What do you want?  Yep.  They usually are, Nothing.  What time of day?  Middle of the afternoon.  Oh, he just wanted money.  You've got to yell.  You're right.  You have to yell at these people and go like, What?  No.  He was drunk.  And he was asking me, like, for a favor.  He's like, Um. 
[00:29:30]  What did you need, Danny?  He was engaging me in a conversation.  He was walking.  He was like, No, man, because I've got to drive my thing down, and you can help me because  I've got to.  But he wasn't asking me for money.  He was almost like, If I just leave it, I've got to pick it up later.  It was almost like he was asking me to drive his car.  It was some bizarre.  What?  I don't know.  He was loaded.  I just kept walking.  I'm like, What?  What are you talking about?  Anybody wouldn't stop talking to me.  It was like, And then I was like, All right.  I can't tell him to go, uh, to go F himself because he's, he's conversing with me like 
[00:30:00]  he, either A, thinks he knows me, or B, he's like asking me something that makes sense to  him.  It was like, he wasn't a homeless guy asking for money on it.  It was so weird.  Yeah.  But then I keep walking.  It was on a little, uh, some drugs.  That's all.  I didn't really know what he was doing.  I'm like, Where's your stuff?  Yeah.  I'm like, Where is it?  Then you got to start asking them questions.  Maybe he saw you on the, uh, Bob's Sanket roast.  I don't think so.  No.  I don't think.  Yes, it was Cloris Leachman.  She's a short Spanish man. 
[00:30:30]  I don't know what he wanted, but it was just weird.  I saw, um, a homeless guy go up to an older gentleman in my neighborhood asking for money.  The classic guy, you know, I need to, I, he even said, I need some change because I,  I, I need to eat.  And it was obviously he didn't need to eat.  He wanted this for something else, probably booze or drugs.  Right.  Of course.  So the older gentleman, he had to be in his sixties easily.  He goes, Oh sure.  No problem.  Young man.  I watched this whole thing go down.  Right.  He pulls out his wallet and, and you could see the homeless guy just licking his, he's 
[00:31:00]  all excited.  Like he's got, he's got a good one.  Right.  The freaking older guy takes the money out.  And I don't know how much it was, but it looked like a few dollars, anywhere from a  couple of dollars to about 10 shekels.  And then goes, come on, young man, I'll go get you something to eat and puts his arm around  the homeless guy and starts walking him toward a bodega.  And the conversation at that point, they were out of, uh, you know, I couldn't really hear  anymore, but you could tell the guys was just like, well, I'm going to eat later. 
[00:31:30]  And I, and I, and the guy's like, no, I'll, I'll get you something to eat.  Oh, he wanted booze or drugs.  Sure.  And then the guy kind of like wrestled out of the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, older gentleman  had on him and, and just took off.  Very funny.  Cause it won food.  Oh, because he pulled out the money and just had him going, had him going, uh, back to the  old lady in the elevator.  Presses the button for her.  When they arrive at five, he says, this is your floor.  She begins to step out.  Then he grabs her from behind.  She said, all I saw was blackness for the rest of her life. 
[00:32:00]  Well, the guy next to her, she's going to no longer trust.  She's going to be in fear.  So her sense of security that everyone, welcome to our world is gone.  Oh, brother.  Uh, path from Munaki, uh, third floor robbery, assault and hat removal.  Uh, another picture postcards.  He'll get that.  Vinny's jumping ahead here.  Vinny. 
[00:32:30]  Hey, we're professionals.  We're professionals.  We're going to get to what you have to say here.  They took my cane.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They, uh, this guy took her cane on top of it.  Yeah.  Why?  So she wouldn't be able to walk and get help immediately?  Chase him with a cane.  Yeah.  Why you?  Here's the, oh, sorry, sir.  This may have been more than a simple mugging.  Lily in France had nearly $900 in her handbag, withdrawn a few minutes before from the  Banco Popular here on Eastern Parkway. 
[00:33:00]  Banco Popular.  He believes the mugger may have an accomplice she remembers from inside the bank.  Oh.  Ah, so he knew she had, uh, nine, uh, nine, uh, what they call clams on her.  Nine clams.  You see how heavy he's breathing, too, at one point.  Yeah.  Look at his breath.  He's ready.  He's all psyched up for it.  Shallow breath.  Yep.  You can see before.  Psyched up for the attack.  He's getting pumped up.  What a beast.  And the floor comes.  You can see his hand gesture.  Like, here's your floor.  And he kind of like.  Yeah, he points.  There's the door.  She goes to walk out.  She thinks she made it. 
[00:33:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  She should have been looking, walking out.  I'm tired, though.  She's 85.  Oh, my gosh.  She's stupid.  She's not a merchant marine.  She did.  Are they saying the accomplice was on that floor?  Because that's a little weird that you would mug someone as the door's opening, because there  could be someone on the other side that's going to help her out.  Well, it could be, right.  You're right.  How do you know someone's not waiting there?  So the door opens.  There could have been an accomplice that was keeping people away from the elevator at that  point or something.  Because why?  You know what I mean?  Why wouldn't you mug her as the elevator's going down, then the door opens, and you're 
[00:34:00]  out of there?  Well, they were going up.  I think they were going up.  If she had just come from the bank, they were probably going up.  Oh, I see.  And if you look, he runs down the stairs.  But why wait for the door to open?  What if somebody was standing there waiting to come into the elevator?  Probably because once the door's open.  Maybe he wouldn't have nailed her then.  Once the door is open, you know that you can walk right out and get out of there.  That's probably why I put the cane as a weapon in case anybody tried to stop him.  I'm guessing.  Why else would you take her cane?  It was her cane, yes.  Unless it was to protect yourself from someone else trying to stop you. 
[00:34:30]  Plus, you know what?  Yes, they're dead.  It also looks like one of those old school elevators where the inside door opens, but  then you have to push the outside door to get out.  Oh, that's a nice one.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  That always spells great neighborhood.  Yeah.  He took her cane, by the way, because it got jammed in the door.  Oh, really?  Yes.  The cane fell.  At the end of the video, you could see the cane fell.  He didn't steal the cane.  I think he just pulled it out of the door so nobody would see the door jump open and catch him.  Oh.  And then he took the cane with him.  Yeah.  Sure, he just kind of threw it in the stairwell. 
[00:35:00]  What a guy.  And moved on.  But they probably have his fingerprints all over that button because they know what button  he was pushing.  There's probably nobody there after him pushing it.  So they'll get him.  And they got some video on him that looks pretty clear.  He's got 50 shots.  This guy's got, like, American Idol footage.  Them walking in the building.  Singing.  Oh, they got him good.  Jen on Long Island.  Jen.  Hey.  What's up, Ant?  Oh, sorry.  I can tell by the voice.  It's not you.  No, it's not the one you hate. 
[00:35:30]  Mm-hmm.  Trust.  So I was going to say, you know, you're talking about she's, uh, she was, you're welcome  to your world because she saw that blackness.  You do realize the victim was black, too, right?  Yes.  Yes, we do.  You saw the neighbors and the neighbor testimony.  Another black-on-black crime.  Isn't it a shame?  It is a shame.  We need more white people to be victimized.  Come on, black people.  Step it up.  All right.  I'll be to your house later.  Okay, Jen.  Thank you. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, African princess.  Calling from, uh, Wyandanche, I would guess.  Uh.  No?  Well, now she's got to call back.  Problem?  We could play guest of town with Jen.  She just said Long Island, so I'm thinking Wyandanche.  Amityville.  Wheatley Heights.  Malvern.  Malvern.  Hampstead.  Right.  Or would it be West Hampstead.  Uniondale.  Uniondale.  Uh, if you don't understand these towns, just insert your own around your city.  Sure.  Well, a, uh, American hero is getting out of jail today, and, uh, really? 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  And here's the story.  This is a quickie before we squeeze in a break here.  British glam rocker, Gary Glitter.  American hero.  How did you?  Why are you calling him American hero?  Well, who hasn't done a little, uh.  Da-na-na.  Hey!  Da-na-na-na-na-na.  Hey!  Yeah.  Stupid Gary Glitter ruined it for everyone.  This is him trying to grab his laptop back at the airport. 
[00:37:00]  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Down and a-  Hey!  No!  No!  This man should be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Oh, should he?  Oh, my God.  For this song alone, right?  Every arena does this song.  That is true.  We're used to.  I think they're creeping back in, yeah.  Ah, there was a, there was a movement to get rid of this song at that time.  They played at the Little League games.  No.  Da-na-na.  Gay!  Da-na-na-na. 
[00:37:30]  Let's hear it.  This is great.  Hey, where's the hey?  This guy is famous for saying hey.  That's it.  Only on to what channel?  I barely hear the hey.  Must be nice to be, uh, famous for this.  This is what it sounded like when he was in jail.  I didn't even hear the hey.  Yeah, he was in, uh, I guess, uh, somewhere in Southeast Asia, right? 
[00:38:00]  In Vietnam?  Vietnam, I believe, yeah.  And, um, he, uh, no, he was the way, yeah, he had been there, but then he took his, a computer  to the computer store, uh, to get fixed.  What a dummy.  And, um, I actually think hard copy prints of child pornography fell out of his laptop.  Oh, yeah, the laptop.  He had a lot of kiddie porn on his computer.  He dropped off the laptop.  As soon as he left, uh, the laptop started screaming, help me. 
[00:38:30]  Help.  Help me.  Ow.  Help me.  Ow.  But it's obvious they got it fixed, so that's a good endorsement for the place.  Well, yeah, they, they, they got the pictures.  Yeah, that should be their commercial.  We fixed Gary Glitter's laptop.  Yeah.  Here's the story.  British glam rocker Gary Glitter is out of prison this morning.  He served nearly three years in Vietnam for molesting two girls, ages 10 and 11.  His lawyer says Glitter, whose real name is Paul Francis Gad, does not want to return to his hometown of London.  If he does, he'd be required to register as a sex offender. 
[00:39:00]  Glitter is expected to live in either Singapore or Hong Kong.  Singapore?  They don't, they don't mess around in Singapore.  He better be a good boy.  Wow.  Really?  That is like the scariest place in the world to live as far as, you know, the rules.  Yeah, you litter there.  They, they, they cane you.  Hmm.  That's a, that's a gutsy move on his part because I don't think the perv is out of him.  Can I say that I would love to get at least a certain lawyer on the phone?  Who?  This guy was suing Columbia University. 
[00:39:30]  What is that about, Jimmy?  His, that name is Roy Den Hollander and he's a, he's an anti-feminist lawyer and he's suing  them because he's, I guess he's tired of all the women's studies and they don't have men's  studies.  Like he sues clubs for ladies night because they charge men more money.  Right.  I do.  I love this guy.  This guy hates women.  No, he's probably just tired.  No, he's probably just tired of the stupid left wing thing where it's okay to, you know,  women's study.  Yes.  I'm bringing up another case. 
[00:40:00]  I just love this dude.  I would love to talk to this guy.  Just annoying Columbia.  I hope they have to get rid of all, or get rid of all their stupid women's study groups  or, or have as many for men or you don't get as funny.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll see.  Just a waste of time.  I love the story that pops up every few years where the guy has to like sue Hooters.  Oh yeah.  Cause he wants to work there.  It's like, all right, enough.  This guy may have a shot though.  I mean, if I don't know the law that state and federal funding for schools, but they  have to abide, that's why you can have like private schools, Christian or religious, but 
[00:40:30]  you can't have state funded religious schools.  I don't think.  Speaking of broads, you hear about, uh, where is it in Australia?  Australia, the town in Australia where, uh, this, uh, this, uh, the, the mayor or whatever  the hell he is, the big, the big cheese.  He wants ugly girls to move to his town.  Ugly girls.  He's encouraging the ugly girls to move to his town saying that you could find a husband  in my town because there's a lot of men here and not enough women. 
[00:41:00]  So he's calling all ugly girls, calling all ugly girls.  Let me tell you something.  I've, uh, trolled, I've trolled many a website, uh, for, uh, pornography and, uh, I've seen  some exclusive, uh, Australian girl porno.  They are not the most attractive women, uh, that I've seen.  Aussie, Aussie girls.  There's a few of them out there, you know, ones that, uh, end up being, uh, celebrities,  stars, movie stars. 
[00:41:30]  But for the most part, they really don't look that good.  I mean, wow.  It's all that, uh, that, that, you know, that, that breeding.  That breeding.  Yeah.  Cause they were all, uh, like prisoners from England shipped over there.  And it was really hard to get over there for, for a few hundred years there.  They got the scurvy.  So they kind of had to have sex with each other.  The rest of the world, you know, you get to get a few combinations going.  Yeah.  You know, it's just too much white in their blood. 
[00:42:00]  Not good.  Aussie mayor urges unattractive women to move into town.  The mayor of an Australian outback mining town has come under fire for urging unattractive  women to move in.  How great is this?  Assuring them they will find a man because there is a shortage of women.  John Maloney, mayor of Mount Issa, uh, told a newspaper his town was a place for ugly ducklings  to flourish into beautiful swans and called on the beauty disadvantaged to flock there.  Beauty disadvantaged.  In the face of outrage over his remarks, Maloney stood by his comments saying he did, he did 
[00:42:30]  not mean to cause offense.  Well, I said beauty disadvantage, he told national radio.  Now beauty is in the eye of the, uh, the beholder.  Beauty could be a good set of teeth.  Beauty is a nice wavy hair.  Uh, beauty could be blue eyes or green eyes.  Is there such a thing as disposition, temperament, manners, general attractiveness, attitude,  and demeanor, uh, demeanor.  All those things tend to make a person attractive.  Mount Issa City Council Gary Asmus said that while there was a shortage of women, uh, Maloney's 
[00:43:00]  comments were an insult to their town's menfolk.  Ah.  Oh my God.  That's, that's, that's, uh, that's Aussie porn right there.  Yeah.  See, they're just, yuck.  They're all off.  Yuck.  They've gone a little off.  Uh, the mayor was returning us to the dark ages and making the guys that live in this  town seem like sex hungry star men that will bounce upon the first girl that they see walking  down the street, he said.  So there's a bit of an outrage in this town. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  Huh?  That's, that's pretty ballsy.  I like that.  When does that, I like what, when, when did outrage reach a mining town in Australia?  Well, we've, we've totally lost.  That as a planet, when a mining town has to be politically correct, it's, uh, it's, uh,  the old internet making the world smaller, smaller.  Yes.  Uh, let's say hi to Mike in Jersey.  Mike.  How's up, boys?  Hey.  Um, I used to work at a computer shop and, uh, people would constantly be bringing in 
[00:44:00]  their systems.  And, uh, we, we had three instances where they actually had, um, titty porn on it.  And these, these perverts wouldn't even try hiding it or anything like that.  It would be all sprawled out on their desktop to see the files.  So we'd actually have to call the, uh, the feds or call the police.  Um, and they would, we had to wait for them to, uh, to come and get the machine.  Meanwhile, the people are calling in.  They, what are you guys doing with my computer?  Why are you taking so long to fix my computer?  I'm going to call the cops.  And they're like, well, I think the cops are going to actually end up calling you 
[00:44:30]  pretty soon.  Well, the thing is, they probably don't think you can see it or they're, well, what kind  of an idiot doesn't just chalk it up to a loss when you're, when your computer, what's  wrong with people?  Exactly.  It's amazing that I find that to be the problem and not the kiddie porn.  I really am an idiot.  You gotta be, my publisher decision-making afterwards.  Why don't they store it in a special file?  Well, you gotta jerk I am.  You gotta be smart.  You gotta be smart in naming the files.  You gotta name it like 2007, uh, tax, taxes. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, yeah.  Exactly.  They were naming like 13-year-olds.  Right, right, yeah.  You're not even trying.  Idiots.  You name it 2007 taxes and then you get audited.  And there, there's the IRS guy.  Oh, this is interesting.  You're claiming a Loatian boy.  Yeah.  Yeah, just, you gotta name the file differently.  The 2007 easy, easy form.  Who's gonna click on that?  Thank you, Mikey. 
[00:45:30]  Thank you.  More of your phone calls.  877-212-018.  You got any files on your computer?  Not, not, not anything bad like that.  Like illegal stuff.  But have you ever tried to hide anything on your computer and named it a different file  and put it somewhere deep in like the system?  Like the Windows system?  Wow, what are you up to?  No, no.  Well, you know, sometimes there are pictures and things that you maybe don't want somebody  else to see.  So you hide it in the system file and name it something, you know, that sounds like a 
[00:46:00]  system name or something.  What are you hiding?  Glockenspiel.  What are you hiding?  In general, porn is porn.  What are you gonna get in trouble for?  No, let's say, let's say you have pictures of yourself nude that are, no.  All right.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Maybe it's like pictures of other people nude.  Ah.  Something like that.  Ah.  So you want to like tuck them away.  Ah.  So you hide them in deep in the Windows like registry files. 
[00:46:30]  I just, but I rename them.  I'll put like, I'll put girlfriend, but then I'll put naked N-E-K-K-I-D.  I misspell it.  N-E-K-K-E-D.  Yeah, I've done that.  I got a few pictures of my hog.  Oh, do you?  Yeah, of course.  Yes.  Could I see those, please?  Here, we got a lot of...  They're files that are delicious.  We could continue with this after the break.  And people are requesting the Ernest Borgnine today.  Can we replay that today, please? 
[00:47:00]  Can we find that?  Words to Live by Lloyd.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, let's play that after the break.  More of your phone calls, too.  877-212-0&A.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Hi.  877-212-0&A.  Make sure you check out onaradio.com.  Still got lots going on to discuss.  Some of the colleges out there are getting together. 
[00:47:30]  They want to drop the drinking age back down 18.  Wow.  This is one of those things that I thought wouldn't happen.  Like, who gets behind that one and tries to rally support?  They're trying because they're saying at these universities that the kids are ignoring the drinking age anyway.  And it's causing a lot of binge drinking.  And they think they could control the binge drinking if they make the legal age 18 again.  What's the logic behind that?  Not really sure.  They probably want to be able to sell it on campus and make money.  And they have to figure out a good way to do that. 
[00:48:00]  So they say if we sell it to 18-year-olds, we'll make more money, but we can't just say that.  So let's figure out a medical reason that makes sense.  They're lying.  And then maybe if they go into the liquor store or something and they're hammered, they won't sell it to them or in a bar.  You can cut them off.  But you can also not sell it to them anyway, and they'll still get to drink the way they are.  And now this is legal for them to have it.  I don't see how that works.  Terrible logic.  Well, one of the guys that are for this says,  If kids are going to drink, whether it's legal or illegal, we'd at least be able to have a more open dialogue with students about drinking as opposed to this sham where people don't want to talk about it because it's a violation of the law. 
[00:48:30]  Wait.  He thinks that if they're allowed to drink, he said we'll have a more open dialogue.  Like, it's against the law now, but now we'll make it legal.  And then you'll be willing to sit down and listen like gentlemen.  I like to hear that dialogue with drunken 18-year-olds in some room somewhere.  Yeah, it's great. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, that's not going to work.  Fast Freddy's giving us an alert here.  What's the Matthew McConaughey commercial?  He hates it.  I don't know.  Maybe it was playing over on satellite.  No, it's over here.  No, it's over here.  I am.  And Fast Freddy's saying it's the gayest crap ever.  Yes.  What?  Gayest crap ever.  I'm the expert.  Yes.  It's the new improv.  It's the new beef commercial.  He's voicing it.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, really? 
[00:49:30]  Do you like beef commercials?  No.  Perfect improvisation.  Just amazing.  See, what you do is just give a one-word answer.  It's a hail of gunfire, no matter what response.  Sorry.  Just walk into the left, get shot, walk into the right.  You don't have to hold on a piece of loose leaves to defend yourself.  I wasn't, though.  I'll put it down.  Boo.  I actually didn't even mean that paper. 
[00:50:00]  It's meant in general.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Thanks, Steve.  Terrific.  All right.  Anyway, where were we?  Is the beef commercial worth playing for the rest of the country?  Is it awful?  It's pretty bad.  I'm just saying it's bad, though.  Now, didn't the old beef commercials used to be voiced by that strapping  beefcake gentleman who was in Roadhouse?  What's his name?  Swayze.  No, he's got the deep voices.  Sam Elliott.  Okay.  Sam Elliott. 
[00:50:30]  Beef.  It's what's for dinner.  That was the guy.  Now Matthew McConaughey is a...  Jesus.  You got it?  What's he doing with it?  I want to thank Fast Freddy for completely stopping the show.  Thanks, Fast Freddy.  With his observation.  Thank you, Fast Freddy.  Thank you.  I got this for him.  Oh, that's terrible.  Oh, no.  That's terrible.  That's just awful.  Awful.  Aye, nigh.  All right.  Well, we got a guy that...  Man, he's a perv. 
[00:51:00]  He's got that perv switch.  Perv switch went off?  Well, I don't know if it went...  Couldn't hold back?  I don't know if it went off.  He's into something a little different.  Oh.  Let me cue this up here.  My interest is piqued.  Well, that's what we try to do on this show.  All right.  Well, here you go.  Well, authorities say that he's got a fetish with diapers.  He allegedly wears them.  All right.  I just don't get this one at all.  Diapers.  Did you go in your diety? 
[00:51:30]  He's called infantilism.  Yeah.  Remember we had the guy that was in diapers and he came on with the dominatrix?  I sure do.  And we were told not to laugh at him.  Yeah.  Then he comes in dressed as old school baby.  Well, like, how do we not laugh at him?  You can't come in like old school baby with the big bonnet on it.  The bonnet.  He looked like the baby from The Little Rascals.  That was like, ah, go chase yourself.  Yeah, sure.  He was a big, fat guy in a diaper and the little, like, baby dress outfit and the bonnet. 
[00:52:00]  And the bonnet.  He was well over 250 pounds in an oversized diaper.  And he got changed, didn't he?  Yeah, he sure did.  The dominatrix changed him, like, laid him down on a little mat on the floor and he was kicking his little legs, his big fat legs.  And he's like, I don't mind talking about this.  He was trying to be all serious and we're just laughing.  This is what I do as a release for a thing.  You're in a diaper.  Shut up.  No one's taking you seriously. 
[00:52:30]  Danny, could you go back to that picture you found?  Adult baby pictures could be the funniest thing you can find on the internet.  Just put in adult baby on Google, I guess.  Is there anything funnier than that?  Right there.  Look at this tool.  Can we get that up on O&A Radio?  And he's trying to bend his legs in that friggin' bow-legged baby stance.  Well, the bending of the legs is so, you know, mama could, you know, clean you up.  Oh, clean you up with a little baby wipe?  He's getting into the clean-up position. 
[00:53:00]  What love do you need?  Huh?  How much love do you need?  What happened in your youth?  What was missing that drove you to that?  Fetishes suck.  You're right.  Fetishes are awful.  They're just embarrassing for everybody.  They really are.  And Jimmy's like, well.  I can't even disagree.  They're horrid.  You know something?  Even the most subtle thing that you might do while you're taking care of business for  yourself goes right out the window at the moment of completion. 
[00:53:30]  You're just like, ugh.  What you got to do with fetishes?  I got to clean this up.  And it looks all silly.  Throw teenage boy sweat socks off your face.  What you got to do with fetishes is just, you got to turn off your brain.  Because if you really start thinking about the situation you're in, it's just ridiculous.  Yeah.  It just looks silly.  You have to somehow, like, just shut the brain off and then maybe, maybe you can get into it.  It feels stupid. 
[00:54:00]  Like, look at this guy.  Oh, stop.  I want a montage of baby adult diaper pictures on O&A Radio.  Did his parents, like, send him out to work at three or something?  Like, that's the only way.  I missed my childhood.  Oh, God, look at this fat retard.  He's got, he's got, like, a little, a pacifier around his neck.  A giant safety pin in the front. 
[00:54:30]  What company makes the adult diapers?  Not, not the ones.  Yeah, not like the pens.  Right, but this, old school diapers that look really big.  He looks like me.  He does not look like you.  Yeah, he kind of looks like you.  He's much fatter, Jimmy.  He is fatter, but he looks the face.  You're svelte, Jim, now.  It's the face.  Yeah?  Oh, it's terrible.  You think he looks like you?  It's terrible.  Let's get back to this guy.  Find more adult diaper pictures, please. 
[00:55:00]  Well, authorities say that he's got a fetish with diapers.  He allegedly wears them and is accused of showing them to young children.  I know these guys got to be professional, but how are you not laughing as you're doing this story?  Show them to young children.  Get a load of this clown.  What an ass.  Why the seriousness?  Like it's a space shuttle launch.  Oh, my God.  Nappy guy.  Nappy guy.  Oh, nappy guy because he's taking a nap.  Well, it's taking a little nappy.  Nappy's a British diaper, I think.  That's the term for British diaper. 
[00:55:30]  Is it?  Yeah.  How did you know that?  Who doesn't?  Right?  Common knowledge, Ed.  Yeah.  I bet it is.  In some sectors.  Certain circles.  Certain circles of nappy guy.  Should we give out this website or should we wait to get all the goodness for ourselves first?  I was just talking about diapers in England.  Yeah.  So I can't really get to anything.  All right.  Well, oh, damn.  I have the password.  Why am I just bashing Steve today? 
[00:56:00]  You're not.  You're just doing impressions.  They come in and go, oh, yes, you do.  Yes.  The password is.  Yes.  Let's get him in here for a minute.  Please.  I want to ask him something.  Where is the improv?  You want to ask him?  Please no more, Steve.  I hate him on the radio.  Please.  I have to ask him.  I hate Steve on the radio.  I got to be honest.  We need Steve for a second.  Please no.  I'm impervious to improvisation.  Please no.  Please.  I want to ask him to improv something.  We got to have him do like taggots and stuff.  You know, those little improv things. 
[00:56:30]  Here goes Steve.  Give him an occupation and a location and have him act out a scenario.  We're looking at adult baby pictures.  Yes.  And we have this one for nappy guy, a website.  And Anthony was joking that you might have had a password.  Yeah, Danny said it's a pay site.  What is your username and password on the adult diaper site?  Oh, my God.  Loves adult babies.  Password.  Nothing.  Oh, I hate him on the radio. 
[00:57:00]  Steve.  Yes.  Why would your username be loves adult babies?  Because it's easy to remember.  No, it's abbreviations.  L-U-V-S.  Or L-U-V-Z.  I'm sorry.  Yes.  A-D-L-T-B-A-B-I-S.  My scalp is tingling.  Steve Rosé shows his password.  Nothing comes to mind.  It's wonderful.  All right, Steve.  Thanks.  We move on. 
[00:57:30]  Showing them to young children.  A neighborhood in Holiday knows all about this man known as Boy Diaper.  Boy Diaper?  Wow.  Oh, he's really going for it.  The best part of that sentence is everybody knows.  I mean, it might be okay if one or two people know.  Yeah.  I know your name is Boy Diaper, but when it gets to the point, everybody knows.  Aren't you Boy Diaper?  Well, he's the guy that Robin actually aced out for the job. 
[00:58:00]  Holiday knows all about this man known as Boy Diaper.  31-year-old Martin Bagness was charged in February with wearing a diaper and showing it to kids.  Police know all about him.  In 1999, he was convicted for a similar crime, and he's on Utah's sex offender registry, where his alias is Boy Diaper.  The February case happened on this street in Holiday, and he was charged with 11 counts of lewdness involving a child.  He always had a big bag on him. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, oh, okay.  I was sure we were going to have to dump that until she continued.  Whoa.  I don't know what kind of diapers he's using.  Do they make transparent ones?  On him with diapers in it, and then he would ask the kids if they wanted to see his diapers,  and then he would pull his pants down and his shirt up and show them that he was wearing diapers.  Aw, it's cute.  Aw.  Is that pedophile, though, or is he just... 
[00:59:00]  Exhibition.  Or not even sexual, but really trying to be a kid.  That's weird.  Um, yeah.  That's bizarre.  Yeah.  I want to find out where he works, and then we can make some more decisions, you know.  Play he's a lawyer.  Preying on the most innocent of victims.  Yesterday, Bagness was arrested after authorities say he came to this recreation center  and exposed the diaper he was wearing to children.  We're frustrated because we've made numerous arrests, numerous contacts with this man, 
[00:59:30]  and it seems that he's back out in the street.  The 31-year-old lives with his parents in Holiday.  Of course he does.  His mother claims Bagness suffers from dyslexia and was a victim of bullying during school.  Oh, God damn it.  Shut up.  You stupid enabling mother.  Smack him in the face.  And say, take that diaper off.  Dyslexia.  And he was bullied.  Shut up.  Well, he's dyslexia.  Everything's backwards.  He's big, but he wears small person clothes.  Yes.  Little person's clothes.  He's going backwards. 
[01:00:00]  Stop it.  Yeah, he should be shot.  In school, she says he never recovered.  Maybe his happiest time was when he was a little child, and maybe that's why he's so got this fixation on children.  Kill yourself with diapers.  Well, that's another problem.  That's a physical problem.  Maybe mommy shouldn't have been taking tennis lessons.  A little attention might have helped.  She says that the diapers are a physical problem, so she's trying to blame it on the fact that perhaps he's incontinent and has to wear diapers. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  He's showing children, and it doesn't seem like he's wearing adult diities.  Well, that's another problem.  That's a physical problem.  But those living on Kentucky Avenue have no sympathy with his past.  They're upset.  Bagness still gets to walk the streets despite his records.  It's frustrating to see that the system doesn't work.  Because it's only a matter of time before someone else.  And I don't know.  He just grosses me out. 
[01:01:00]  Grosses me out.  How would you feel if you were a mother?  Let's put devil's advocate for a minute.  All righty.  You do the best you can.  Yeah.  And your best work is being arrested at age 31 for wearing diapers and showing children.  How does that make you feel?  That's where your best efforts got everyone.  What a monumental failure this woman is.  Yes.  She has failed at the easiest job ever.  I do believe she wasn't a good mommy. 
[01:01:30]  Just giving birth and making sure the kid has what he needs.  You couldn't raise a bigger goose egg.  And he lives at home.  It's not like, look, my son, the physicist, wears diapers.  Yeah.  He lives at home.  He's been arrested for showing his diapers to children.  And he continues to do so.  She has to make his mac and cheese every day.  Exactly.  What was that last picture you had there, Danny?  Don't even attempt to say it was hot.  Now, hold on. 
[01:02:00]  Don't even attempt to say it was hot.  The girl in the diety.  That's hot?  It's not hot because it looks like it's used.  And there's like a pad around back or something.  But there's something.  No, rip the diety off.  I'm undressing her with my eyes is what I'm doing.  It's boy shorts made out of diaper material.  Yeah.  It's not hot.  I agree it's not.  Brow.  It's not hot.  I thank God the diaper fetish never grabbed a hold of me.  Oh, my God. 
[01:02:30]  I don't know how embarrassing that would be.  Do you want to say a fetish just line up at my door because they know eventually I'll invite them in?  You're going to latch on to one?  They really do.  They're like birds.  I'm like an old man in the park and fetishes are like little pigeons.  They just know that I'm going to drop bread eventually.  Sometimes I feed the birds.  I hope Jake will be by.  Is that his name?  I never thought certain things would grab me.  But lo and behold.  Yeah.  It's late at night.  You're online.  You're rifling through your Rolodex. 
[01:03:00]  And, boy, don't you find a video that just tickles your fancy a certain way.  Oh, really?  What is that video, Jim?  I mean, I'm speaking in general.  Just in general.  Whatever, yeah.  So, you know, you'll indulge as you watch the video?  Yeah.  Maybe I'll try that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Lavoris afterwards?  Oh, okay.  Oh, it involves liquid?  Sometimes, sometimes not.  Oh, right.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:03:30]  Mm-hmm.  You're a weirdo.  Dude, I know.  Oh, Opie and Anthony.  Thank you.  Opie and Anthony.  What were you talking about, Jimmy?  A fan.  I normally don't go to video links, but this fan sent me a link to a video site.  He goes, it's the worst site on the net. 
[01:04:00]  And I don't remember the name of it.  I'm trying to find it.  Foundry music.  Oh, my God.  Before I got a sentence out, you had that one ready.  Yes, foundry.  Get out of my way.  And it's got all the horrible videos, like the beheadings and the horrible stuff.  And I always watch that stuff.  I wish I didn't, but a part of me.  I know.  Why do you watch?  I don't know.  It's like you're trying to conquer something.  There's no pleasure in it. 
[01:04:30]  You're trying to.  I don't know.  I wish I had a better answer for you.  Yeah, I can't go there.  The same as the people who are rubberneck.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  And the beheading videos I've seen are so bad.  But the ones that they have on this site are even worse because they're, I'm guessing they're, it's Muslim, I think, because someone's yelling Al-Aqbar, but they're not like, they're not Iraqi or Jordanian.  I want to guess Chechnian or something like that.  That's still Muslim, yeah.  Yeah, but it sounds like they're speaking Russian or something like that or some Eastern European.  Just, it's just horrible. 
[01:05:00]  And they do the beheading slow?  Yeah, that was what I was telling Anthony off the air.  It was, it was, they don't just do it and get it done.  It's almost like the one guy's filming and there's a bunch of soldiers.  It looks like, it looks like, because they're all armed, heavily armed guys.  It looks like it's some kind of civil war or something.  And they're all just laying on their stomachs and they're just bleeding them out.  But the one guy's grabbing the guy under the chin and lifting his head so he's trying to breathe.  It's like, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Oh, my God.  And the guy holding the video camera's like chuckling about something.  Why do you watch this?  I don't know. 
[01:05:30]  You're like a crazy person.  It's just.  It's going to give you nightmares.  It was awful.  People have tried to set themselves on fire.  Like suicide's bad.  Is it toxic?  Well, I don't want to give out this site just in case, but is it toxic something?  I don't believe it is.  I don't know.  All right.  I might not even know it if I heard it.  Okay.  I don't think I'd actually give this one out on the air.  This is just too creepy.  Yeah, too.  A little too.  This is too awful.  And you saw like videos of guys burning alive?  This one guy did like a medley, if I maybe prevented, of people who have set themselves 
[01:06:00]  on fire in suicide attempts.  And some have actually lived.  And there's a bunch of them.  First of all, if you're going to kill yourself and you set yourself on fire, if you commit  to do that and you do it, if I had a hat, I'd tip it to you.  I don't get it.  That has got to be the most painful way to go.  Hold a match under your finger.  Burning.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ow!  It's horrible.  Now, that on your entire body, fire stinks.  Who lights fire on them? 
[01:06:30]  No one.  Who sees a fire and says, that would feel wonderful all over me.  All over me.  All over me.  I've got to just rub fire all over my body.  That's horrid.  Yeah.  And this one guy, some of the videos are terrible.  This one guy, he really wanted to commit suicide.  He's like on the 8th or 10th floor of an apartment building.  And he sits in the window and he sets himself on fire and then just leans back out the window.  And jumped?  And falls backwards out the window on fire and hits the ground.  Did he go out when he hit?  It looked like he died.  I mean, who knows? 
[01:07:00]  No, I mean, did the fire go out?  No.  No.  Smoldered and burned him.  Did he go?  Of course he's dead.  Now, it looked like he could have passed on.  Let me tell you something.  There's one guy, it looks like he's in a park somewhere.  And most of these things are not in America.  So you can't really understand what people are yelling.  I imagine it's ouch in another language.  How do you say marshmallow in Portuguese?  And this one guy's in a park and it looks like he's standing and he's just burning.  But he's on fire. 
[01:07:30]  And some guy keeps trying to put him out with a blanket.  And it looks like the blanket just gets caught on the guy and starts to burn.  And the guy's walking around with their hands on their hips looking at this guy like, what do we do for him?  What is the guy that's burning?  What is he doing?  Is he walking?  Is he standing?  He's standing and he's moving.  What type of stance?  If you could relate it to a common stance that maybe we've seen people.  Hard to say if he was trying to put himself out with the blanket or if he was trying to get it off him so he would die.  I couldn't tell.  Like instinct is probably that you want to put the fire out. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, and you probably instantly go, wow, bad idea.  Yowza, that hurts.  Really hurts a lot.  It's hard to say because the video is kind of choppy on this one.  But he's standing there and there's a really weird moment where the two guys are just kind of looking at him because they don't know what to do.  And the guy's on fire the whole time.  And they finally get him on the ground.  Go to the horrible wig store just in case you pull through.  A body wig, baby.  A wig wouldn't help this guy. 
[01:08:30]  If he's going to get one, he should go blonde.  Just be completely arrogant about it.  And then they finally get him on the ground.  They finally put him out.  And he's literally just smoldering.  The man is smoldering like a piece of charcoal.  And you can't hear him, but his chest is going up and down.  And his arms keep reaching out a little bit for something.  He's alive.  It's horrendous.  I'm sure he didn't live very long.  I doubt he did well.  So what goes on in your brain when you're seeing these videos and you say to yourself, this is horrendous, and you continue watching? 
[01:09:00]  I can't watch that stuff.  It happens.  It's almost like, first of all, I get really nervous.  It makes me not want to sleep.  You start to realize your own mortality.  I get scared.  And then I'm like, hey, stupid.  None of them were comedians.  None of them were entertainers.  Like, the majority of the beheadings, at least.  Oh, phew, I wish they were, though.  Stupid Bob Kelly.  A puddle of boiling fat on the street.  But your fellow comedians are pretty impressive when they decide to kill themselves, though.  Yeah, but they do it with a gun, usually. 
[01:09:30]  They don't do anything.  There's nothing.  What about the one in L.A. there?  The Hyatt on Sunset Boulevard, where the guy decided that he needed to jump from the roof and land.  He wanted to hit the entrance of the comedy store, where they weren't too nice to him.  And he fell short by 50 feet or so.  He didn't run long enough.  He didn't get a good start.  That guy, you know, he jumped off the roof.  I mean, when all it's said and done, he did just jump off a building.  Richard shot himself.  And, you know, I know a couple other comedians. 
[01:10:00]  I know another guy that hung himself.  Another guy who gassed himself in a garage.  Said, Din the Clowns.  Yeah, right.  Another girl who hung herself.  Hey, funny man.  What, local comedians?  People have comedians.  Anyone that was famous?  No, just Jenny.  I mean, and I didn't know the one guy from the...  Richard Jenny.  Freddie Prinze.  I didn't know Freddie.  He shot himself.  Yeah.  Fire.  Tried to with fire.  Did he try to kill himself?  Yeah, it was a suicide attack.  Oh, wow. 
[01:10:30]  But that's a rare, you know.  You know, he's Richard, so he had to go extreme.  But the idea of doing that, just putting fire on yourself.  That's insane.  But when I'm watching this stuff, I don't know why.  But then I start thinking, like, most of the beheadings tend to be in areas where there's  some kind of a conflict, an armed conflict.  It's religious stuff.  Yeah.  It's not at a mall.  Yeah.  It's not happening in the States.  They usually, a lot of them are soldiers, or they're foreign soldiers, or they're people  who are in that mix.  It still doesn't, like, a clip like that, even though it's far away, and they're speaking 
[01:11:00]  some other language, it doesn't take me far enough out of it to not be completely disturbed  and not be able to watch it.  I can't watch those.  It's still, because no matter where you're from, when that's happening to you, it's  the same reaction you'll get from anybody in any country.  It doesn't matter what language you speak or what religion you are.  My head is being sawn off.  Would you watch those videos on high def?  Oh, God.  The Olympics, they look pretty impressive on high def. 
[01:11:30]  You like that?  Maybe some of these videos on high def.  Jimmy, would you go high def with these videos?  You wouldn't want to.  The one of the guys on fire is jumpy.  A lot of them are jumpy because people are just grabbing them when they're happening.  Yeah.  And there's one from the Fadi Inn in Iraq.  Fadi Inn.  Well, I guess the guy, they translated for you, the guy had failed his mission.  Oh, that dummy.  I gotta be a real wimp.  What is this?  No, turn off my screen.  No, I will not watch that.  What is it?  I'll watch it.  Oh, my God.  Is that Pearl? 
[01:12:00]  No, dude.  I'm not even kidding.  How do I turn this off?  No, it's not Taylor, bro.  Oh.  The green button.  Hit the green button.  I swear to God, this is my line.  I cannot even look.  I don't even care if people call me a wimp.  I can't.  I'm looking straight ahead.  I can't watch the Army of Antsar.  Whatsoever.  I can't watch.  Who is it?  Army of the Twelve Monkeys?  What?  No, there was...  Then there was Tal Wheaton Jihad.  I think they were called.  They're one of them.  Yeah.  That was...  I was aware.  The guy's just talking.  He's just there talking.  Yeah, well... 
[01:12:30]  Is that the one that Elzar Cowie did by himself?  He actually did it?  I don't know.  I don't know.  But if you're in a video...  Yeah.  And you're kneeling...  They always have you kneeling.  If you're talking, and there are, like, arms behind you holding a weapon, and some type  of Arabic-looking writing on a piece of something hanging...  Oh, you're in trouble.  That's a bad video to star in.  You're in Dutch.  You are in the doghouse.  You're in deep, dude.  Oh, you're in a pickle.  As we say... 
[01:13:00]  See, I keep kind of looking, and I don't want to.  Oh, and then the guy's reading a statement.  Oh, boy.  He's got the old hood on.  This is just despicable.  We don't have to watch it.  I mean, I've seen so many of these.  You just want those people killed in horrid ways.  I hope a bomb went off just outside of range to kill him instantly.  That's it.  Thanks, E-Rock.  Oh, that's the site?  No, I don't know.  E-Rock found it. 
[01:13:30]  I don't know.  I don't care about watching this stuff.  It's just...  It's very disturbing to watch, but when people do watch it...  Turn it off, Danny.  I can't watch it.  Oh, Jesus, Danny.  What the hell?  He's over there like it's a cartoon.  It is uncomfortable, though.  It really violates you in a weird way.  Yeah.  I mean, other people out there, I'm sure, have seen them, and I wish I didn't watch them.  It's because the only thing you can do watching videos like that is imagine what that would be like.  You watch it and then imagine, how would that feel?  What if I was in that position?  And it's incomprehensible, the horror that that would be. 
[01:14:00]  So I'd rather not watch.  But even...  That's why we watch porn.  You want to be in that...  Exactly.  See?  You're right.  The porno is great because it puts you in that situation, but why would you want to  put yourself in that situation?  You don't.  You're right.  Of course.  You want to be the person in the movie.  Yeah.  You're like, she's having fun.  Let's go to...  Do people pay attention to her?  Let's go to Jersey.  Jersey.  Hey, I could just picture Jimmy sitting there going, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, 
[01:14:30]  fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, everywhere.  Lee, Lee.  I found the...  Do we have Jimmy's fire song?  I found the website.  The fire ones are bad, but the beheading ones are so graphic.  The fire ones are just...  It's just something on fire.  I mean, they're terrible because you know it's a person and it hurts.  There's one that's kind of funny because the guy, I think, tried to set himself on fire  and then had a thought otherwise and was screaming and trying to take his clothes off.  And he did live.  It looked like he did it to make his girlfriend mad or something.  Oh, that's good. 
[01:15:00]  But he did live.  But was he not pleased with the decision?  Fire is just one of those things where no matter how good it seems an idea at the time,  when you're doing it, you've got to just go, wow.  For the most part, you can't psych yourself up to get that point.  Because you've probably put some type of thing that makes the fire stay on you.  Because you can't just put a match on your head and burn to death.  No.  You have...  You've applied something.  You look silly.  A little match, your head would be ow, and you'd smell like burning hair.  Within seconds, you realize this was a really, really bad idea. 
[01:15:30]  Nick in Beachwood, what's up?  He's got something about the fire people.  Good morning, boys.  Morning.  You guys know the cover of the Rage Against the Machine album?  It's like a Tibetan monk or somebody set himself on fire.  Yeah, that's a famous shot.  Yeah, yeah.  Apparently, after he set himself on fire, he just sat there.  He didn't scream, didn't complain, nothing.  Wow.  Well, that's some of that yoga teaching.  Is that yoga?  Yeah, a little meditation and yoga gets your mind set.  That's some discipline. 
[01:16:00]  It's all about the discipline, my friend.  That's some discipline.  Let's say hi to Jim.  Jim in New Hampshire just doesn't get it.  Jim?  How can you watch that?  Two girls and one cup and not a little beheading.  Are you out of your mind?  That's a big jump, my friend.  Yeah.  Some people can't watch two girls, one cup, I understand.  But that's a big jump you're making right there.  I'm trying.  Yeah.  All right.  You're not doing a good idea.  Set yourself on fire, sir.  Let's go to Marcos in Jersey.  Marcos.  By the way, when fire is on you, I'll bet you the first thought you have is get it off 
[01:16:30]  me.  Get the fire off me.  Can you please leave?  Fire, leave.  Fire, stop it.  Go away.  Fire on you is really unpleasant.  I think the first thought you have is I think there's water around here somewhere.  Yeah.  Let me get in it quickly.  Let me look around and see where the water is.  Marcos.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, Jimmy.  The video you're talking about with the soldiers, that's the one where they're all lined up  like on a hill and they're dragging them one by one? 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, well, yeah.  And the camera's like right in their face and he's like smacking around while they're  bleeding to death?  Yeah, it's really terrible, man.  Oh.  It's really terrible.  Savages.  I think I got the same thing that you got, Jimmy, bro, because for some reason I have  to watch it, I don't know why, and I'm there by myself, it's sick.  I don't know, something's wrong with me, I guess.  It's almost like, nah, because you're not watching it, it's not like watching it for  sexual pleasure or because it's funny, it's just, it's this event that happened, it's  real, it happened. 
[01:17:30]  I mean, everybody has the instinct, because we all do look at the old example at a car  accident.  Every person, there's an instinct thing with that.  I don't know what it is.  Sure.  It's finding a way to avoid it, and I don't know what the instinct thing that drives you  to see that is, but it is there.  Because we all look, we see some disasters happen, we all look.  Maybe we could get a psychologist or psychiatrist.  Which one do we need to talk to?  Which one does the meds?  I believe a psychologist.  Psychologist and the other one just gives you the meds?  Gives you the dope.  Maybe one of those could call, one of those whack jobs could call us and tell us why we 
[01:18:00]  look at this crap.  One of those quacks.  Yeah, those quack quacks.  Thanks, Marcos.  Let's have some fun with Ernest Borgnine once again today.  One of the better clips to come down the old pipe in quite a long time.  Ernest Borgnine, very famous Hollywood actor, 91 years young.  He was being interviewed.  I think a lot of people have seen the video by now, but it's just worth playing again on  the radio here.  To the show show, but real quickly, you're 91 years old.  You look fantastic.  You look like you're in your late 60s, early 70s. 
[01:18:30]  What's the secret?  I don't dare tell you.  You don't need me.  I masturbate a lot.  Okay, I think...  Thank you, Ernie.  That was great.  I actually heard that.  Ernie, have you ever been on YouTube?  Listen, listen, yesterday, yesterday...  What are you talking...  I like this guy.  Okay, we're going to take a quick time out. 
[01:19:00]  You'll be in the after the show show.  Right on to Fox and Friends dot com.  I just shook his hand!  As great as that audio is, they kind of blew it because Ernie there was going to explain  He was going to elaborate.  Because he went, yesterday...  Yesterday.  I really wanted to know what he was going to say after yesterday.  Oh, he was probably going to go into gory details about how he did it, what he used.  I was imagining he was just going to give a number.  Yesterday. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Like 12 times?  Yesterday, 12 alone.  Brian, Long Island.  Hey, yeah.  There's this great, sick video of the guy who was the stalker of Bjork.  And...  The jork.  Yeah, the jork.  The jork.  He sent her a bomb in the mail and documented this all on video.  And I was timing it so that he killed himself.  The exact date of what a package should have gotten there.  And you see it all on camera.  And the disturbing part is, you see him shoot himself and he falls out of frame.  But then you hear all this stuff leaking out of him as he's on the floor. 
[01:20:00]  I saw that video, actually.  Wow, no way.  Yeah, this goes back a few years.  Yeah, Bjork.  He times it so that he does it the minute, like, the last song on her album that he loves.  Yeah, this guy was a real creepy dog.  Wow.  He was doing suicide.  He was, like, shaving parts of his skin off towards the end.  Yeah.  He had all his red bands across his face.  Yeah, I watched some of that video.  It was very disturbing when I watched it.  But jork had a stalker.  I just saw it last night for the first time.  Oh, the suicide guy?  Yeah, it's awful.  Is it?  It really is. 
[01:20:30]  Falls out of frame, though, huh?  Yeah.  But it's just creepy, the whole, like, build up.  And then he finally kills himself.  And then he falls out of frame, like you said.  Yeah.  And you hear.  You hear.  It sounds like something.  Did you say that?  I'm sorry, sir.  You might have said that.  Yeah, you said.  You hear it leaking.  You hear.  It sounds like he's pouring soup out.  Or water.  Wow, that much blood is just pumping out of him?  It literally sounds like water is being spilled.  It sounded, the sound was so.  The makeup makes it creepy, too.  It makes it very creepy.  Because he made up his face in kind of like a tribal, like, look.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, look.  He's a big, fat idiot.  But he shaved his head. 
[01:21:00]  Good.  Good riddance.  He's got the bajorka on freeze frame in the background on a crappy TV.  What does the sign say behind him?  The best of me.  This was 12 years ago?  I thought this was, wow.  Okay.  It's all said that he was going to meet her in heaven because she was supposed to die the  same day because of his bomb.  Oops.  Oh, really?  That's what he was planning.  Wow, what a whack job.  So he mails.  Hold on.  They busted him on it.  They were able to intercept the package.  I'm sorry, Brian.  It's your reason.  Ah.  You continue.  Yes. 
[01:21:30]  So he sent her a bomb.  Yes.  It was supposed to blow up at the exact moment he killed himself.  But they intercepted it.  What a dope.  Eh.  Yeah, the video is very disturbing.  He's in the afterlife just going, where's bajork?  God, what a douche.  Yeah, don't get him.  Very creepy.  All right, see you guys.  Thank you, Brian.  He's all fat in a thong.  How long is this?  He's wearing a thong?  Yeah, he's covering his penis.  It's just, I thought he was naked until he turned around. 
[01:22:00]  He does have a covering on.  He's not nude.  He's got the man boobies working.  He's awful.  Dude, you know what, dude?  She's a very good singer, dude.  Look at the discus.  They finally got video of these beasts throwing this disc.  Look at that thing.  Let it be known.  I'm looking at the gold.  All right, anyway, stunt brain.  Go ahead.  Yeah, I was going to say, what's with the Darth Maul makeup on this guy?  He's got like Star Wars makeup.  Yeah, before that movie came out. 
[01:22:30]  Where does he shoot himself?  He was ahead of his time.  In the mouth.  It's not even graphic.  You hear it, and then he falls.  He's deep breathing right now.  Watch.  No, you don't see anything.  He shoots himself.  Nothing comes out the back.  Oh.  But he makes it.  The noise is uncomfortable.  Oh, I got you.  He makes it.  If you get the audio of that, it's just, if you didn't know what it was, it wouldn't  bother you.  But it's like a pop.  And then he goes like, oh.  And then it just sounds like somebody's spilling water on the floor.  It's disgusting.  It sounds fake. 
[01:23:00]  You don't really.  Danny's just like, oh.  The heavy breathing before he pulls the trigger is really disturbing.  He's listening to one of her songs.  He's really getting himself pumped up.  Dude.  What?  What, Danny?  What I'm watching in the video, I just rewound it a couple of times.  Nothing comes out of his head, but you can see the top of his head actually bubble up  a little bit and not break.  I'll back it up so you guys can see.  It bubbles up a bit.  Oh, thanks for that.  A little piece to his head.  Watch the very, very top of his head right when he pulls the trigger.  Yeah, his head's shaved, so it's kind of easy to see. 
[01:23:30]  It's like someone shooting at a steel door.  What a bad fan he is.  Bam.  You see?  Oh.  Rock.  Wow.  Wow, that bullet wanted to go on.  Yeah, almost came out.  Wanted to leave his brain.  Too bad he didn't have a hat on that could get lifted up.  That'd be almost Laurel and Hardy-ish.  It kind of looked like one of those guys you see on the streets that has the bad toupee  and the wind just kind of puffs it up a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what happened to the top of his skull.  Wow, dude.  That's disturbing.  I never noticed that.  Oh, that is so sick. 
[01:24:00]  See, this is...  I could watch this, though.  Yeah, because there's no real...  Beheading videos I can't watch.  Whoa, that bullet wanted to give him an old exit wound.  The old turkey timer in his head went off.  Can you get the audio of that?  Yes.  All right, Larry in Texas.  Larry!  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, George Carlin used to have a term for this in one of his bits.  And there's an adjective that describes wanting to watch all this crud.  You know, and he would describe it as burning buildings falling on people. 
[01:24:30]  Jimmy, don't you remember that from one of his...  I don't.  I mean, obviously, I'm sure he addressed it because he addressed every...  You certainly captured the essence of Carlin's bit there.  Anyway, I can't remember what it is, but somebody will mind it.  See ya.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Larry, Texas.  Why don't we take a break?  Back to school clothes?  Too sexy?  No.  We'll tell you about it after the break.  And Disney says no to musical panties.  What? 
[01:25:00]  Disney, these people know what they're doing down there in Disney or wherever their corporate  offices are.  Yeah.  Musical panties?  They know how to sell stuff through sex.  I'll explain that one after the break, too.  And then you got a stillborn baby found alive in Morgue.  Hey, we were just talking about that with Dr. Bodden.  Yeah, Dr. Boredom.  What?  Is that what they were calling him?  No, that's what I'm calling him.  Dr. Boredom.  Yeah.  Boredom.  I write a lot of my own material. 
[01:25:30]  Yes, that was Dr. Boredom.  Well, you know, he was stuttering a bit, but he got the point out eventually.  We had the legendary Dr. Bodden on our show yesterday.  Yeah.  He loves talking about death.  He sure does.  And he brought another one of his ghoul friends with him from England.  Ah, whatever.  It's all inside stuff now.  I understand.  O.P. and Anthony. 
[01:26:00]  How's everybody today?  Doing good.  Are you?  Nice.  They just answered their radio.  They answer.  They went, yeah.  I know they're out there.  They went all right.  877-212-ON-A.  Let's go to Seaford.  Rob, what's up, buddy?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Rob.  How are you guys doing today?  Um, good. 
[01:26:30]  So, hey, Jimmy, you're sick, dude.  I love the show, but you're going to creep me out with all this blowing your brains out talk.  But I do have some insight into the crazy Bjork guy.  Okay.  Um, so basically, it was a few years ago, because this stuff is old.  I was, you know, they did a date liner, some sort of 2020 special on the guy.  And the reasoning behind the makeup is, I guess, when these nut jobs go to kill themselves, they will do things like shave their head and paint their face. 
[01:27:00]  Um, so that when they, because, like, this guy was videotaping himself and probably watching it all, but they're looking in the mirror.  And they do these things so they don't recognize themselves.  So it makes it, it makes them, makes it easier for them to kill themselves, basically.  Wow, that's fascinating.  I didn't think that...  Boo!  Right.  Screeching halt.  New York City's going to help us out.  TK, what's up? 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, I want to know if Anthony collects, um, uh, turbans and the kerchiefs that the Muslims wear and bits of blown-up bombs.  No.  Well, you collect Nazi memorabilia, and they killed women and children in pits and dropped babies from the top of the buildings.  What's the difference?  Um, they were snappy dressers.  Oh, but you called the Muslims barbaric, but the Germans are not white, because they have blue eyes and blonde hair, and they look good in a nice uniform.  Uh, no, I don't think I said that. 
[01:28:00]  I said I was a fan of the era.  The whole, uh, thing with the World War II and the 40s, and it was...  Are you a fan of the 2001 era?  It was one of those noble wars, and, you know, uh, and, uh, the, uh, the German army, you gotta admit, snappy dressers, good clothes.  So if the Muslim terrorists dressed really well in a Hugo Boss suit, you'd be a fan of them also?  Uh, I'd be a fan of the way they dressed.  And you'd collect their stuff?  You'd collect their uniforms? 
[01:28:30]  Um...  They blew up 80,000 Americans in our city.  No, I think as time goes by, people would collect more.  I think now it's a little too, you know, soon.  No, I'm not talking about people, I'm talking about you.  You called the Muslims barbarians, but the Nazis were worse.  They, they, I, what am I, what am I praising, uh, the Nazis?  I don't think Anthony ever denied the Nazis were barbarians.  I, I think, yeah, I don't think...  Well, anybody who collects their memorabilia has to be a fan at some subconscious level.  Really?  I, I, I would think so.  I can't just, uh, uh, uh, be, uh, uh, uh, uh, of collecting historical, uh, trinkets and whatnot? 
[01:29:00]  That's, that's the line lots of you guys like to use.  You guys and meaning, by, by you guys, what do you mean?  I mean, all the guys who, like, say, I collect anything about history.  It's a part of history.  Meanwhile, 100% of the collection is beautiful stuff with lovely swastikas on it.  Yeah, it's history.  It's a part of history that you then own.  What's the problem with that?  Why does the History Channel show Hitler footage and all that stuff, sir? 
[01:29:30]  Why do they constantly show this stuff?  Because that's history.  People should know the truth.  Yeah.  But people do collect war artifacts.  You don't think I know the truth?  When Opie says these Muslims are so barbaric in the way they do things.  They are?  It wasn't Opie.  He makes lovely jokes about all the stuff he collects from the Third Reich.  I feel there's a strong juxtaposition going on here.  What's the juxtaposition, sir? 
[01:30:00]  Explain to me what is juxtaposed.  That you were on the dais roasting Bob Saget.  Yes.  All right.  Thank you.  T.K., you made your point.  Thank you, sir.  I don't think you really made much of a point there.  I know what he was getting at, but I didn't agree with him at all.  It's so ridiculous.  He's trying to equate collecting stuff from the 40s, the 30s and 40s, from a part of history  that was probably the most important event of the 20th century. 
[01:30:30]  And he's trying to equate that with Muslims and them being barbaric.  And why don't I collect turbans and stuff?  Stop.  And you would collect stuff like that, by the way.  It's like, it's any time.  It doesn't mean you're four.  When I was in Iraq, me and Colin went to Baghdad Airport.  I did get stuff.  I get my photo taken.  There really wasn't much you could take.  They got a Cinnabon there?  I don't think that.  It's really like that.  It's like a flying in 1973.  Yeah.  You really want to, but you do want to bring something back. 
[01:31:00]  I'm certainly not pro-terrorist, but you collect things sometimes.  Would soldiers over there now grab art?  I guarantee you, like watching Generation Kill, they do grab stuff.  Grab art, things like that, of course.  What if you put one in Osama bin Laden's head and you rifle through his pockets and find  a knife or something like that?  Of course you'd take that with you.  And you tell all your friends when you display it at home, this was bin Laden's knife right 
[01:31:30]  after I shot him.  It's a conversational piece there.  Yeah.  It's one of those little trinkets of history.  When I went to the big pool party this past Saturday, I noticed your very, I mean, when  I say very, I mean very tiny Hitler figurine.  Yes.  Somebody sent me a little Hitler figurine.  This thing was not even close to an inch tall.  Yes.  It's very little.  Extremely little.  And it's giving the old Sigh Heil.  Well, yeah.  And it's just a little trinket. 
[01:32:00]  It was from the era.  I think it's also a way, on a psychological level, and again, I could be off, but it seems  like a way of controlling something that's horrible and scary.  Like, if you own a knife that was used in a war, it's almost like the suffering somebody  felt at the other end of this, and then here I have it, and it's not doing anything awful  to me.  It's just a memorabilia thing.  You got something like, quote, cool, like, wow, this was used in World War I, World War 
[01:32:30]  II, Vietnam, whatever.  Steve from Bayshore actually gave me a little trinket.  What was it?  Gave me a piece of rock, a piece of stone from the Reichstag building.  He gave me a...  What is that?  It's like where the head muckety mucks did all their fun stuff.  All their muckety?  All their planning.  All their muckety.  Yeah, the Reich's chancellery.  You know he went to some dump somewhere in Bayshore and got that, right? 
[01:33:00]  No.  Steve is all legit.  He's on the up and up.  When it comes to memorabilia, I'm very suspicious of, like, pieces of buildings and bricks and  stuff.  Yeah, but he went there.  Yeah, did he?  He did.  Yeah, okay.  He went there.  Why?  Yeah.  He's a fan of the era.  So he's...  We've been on Pal Talk a few times where me and Steve have done a little show and tell.  You do a little show and tell on Pal Talk.  Hey, here's a, you know, a flag.  A nice little flag. 
[01:33:30]  All right, let's say hi to John in Jersey.  John, what's up?  Hey there, Jan.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  When my brother came home from Iraq, he brought with him a piece of Saddam Hussein's palace.  I had friends who came home from Iraq who brought home their headgear and clothing and  things like that because it's memorabilia.  It's things to remember when they were there.  It's not that they respected these people or that they wanted to be like them.  I mean, this guy's a retard.  Fuck him for yelling at you.  Excuse my language.  Well, thank you, sir.  I say the same thing.  Yeah, Anthony. 
[01:34:00]  Ask him for yelling at me.  Little known fact.  Anthony was part of that war, so...  Well, you know, when I hit the beaches of Normandy...  Let's go to Jim in Long Beach.  Jim.  Hey, what's up, Owen?  Hey, Anthony.  Jimmy, I love you, man.  Oh, thank you.  Anthony, no, I'm with you on this.  That guy's a bit of a douche, you know.  My grandfather actually was in Missouri in World War II, and one of the kamikazes that  crashed into the ship, he kept the flag because he always wanted to give it back to the family, 
[01:34:30]  you know, when we came at peace with the man, and he still has it, you know, it's a great  artifact to have.  There's nothing wrong with, like, well, think about all the Nazi swords.  I don't know if you guys brought that up, but these guys are brought back, you know what  I mean?  The artifacts.  The history.  Yeah.  You know?  It's not like Bob Kelly searching through Mayan artifacts, but, you know.  Yeah, Mayan ruins.  That idiot on his spiritual adventure.  I only wish he was kidnapped and worshipped.  Thanks a lot, fellas.  I appreciate it.  Or put on a spigot. 
[01:35:00]  For the villagers.  Yeah.  And Apple.  They would think there's going to be a good harvest because of the giant sea monster that  they were able to land.  Here's Steve from Bayshore saying, Hitler's chancellery was demolished by the Russians after  World War II, and the granite and marble was used to build two huge Soviet war memorials  in Berlin.  In 2003, Steve went to one of them that was being repaired, and he grabbed a nice chunk.  Yeah, did he?  So that is where that came from. 
[01:35:30]  You know, the people over there just put a pile of rocks together, knowing people like  Steve would just grab those rocks.  You think?  Yeah.  Of course.  Well, I'm taking his word for it.  How much attention does John Mayer need?  I know he's kind of a friend of the show, but he's just bagging things on.  He hasn't been here for a long time.  Yeah.  He knows we'll ask him uncomfortable questions.  He's wearing a Batman hoodie with Batman ears.  What a douche.  I think he enjoys the attention that the paparazzi gives him. 
[01:36:00]  All right, whatever.  He's thrown over him.  The picture just popped up online.  Hey, Dano, what's up?  Kentucky.  Check it in.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Happy birthday, Amy.  Thank you.  Hey, Anthony, I'm sorry that guy called and tried to make you an awful person.  We all think you're an awful person, but I'm not going to pass judgment on you.  I'm kidding.  I love collecting.  I have a rock from Noriega's house in Panama, a piece of marble from Saddam's Victory Over 
[01:36:30]  America's Palace.  I have all kinds of rotten people memorabilia.  It doesn't mean you worship them.  It just means it's cool and you like to talk about it.  It's an excellent trophy.  Back in the day when I was working at Buffalo, we gave pieces of the Berlin Wall away, a little  known fact.  So the 103rd caller got a piece of the Berlin Wall, everybody.  And I got a piece of the Berlin Wall, and it sat in my apartment for a while, and no 
[01:37:00]  one gave a crap.  So guess what?  I don't have a piece of the Berlin Wall anymore.  You threw away a piece of history.  Hell yeah, I did.  Because there was no way to prove that this was part of the Berlin Wall.  A dopey radio station of Buffalo has pieces of the Berlin Wall that we're giving away?  Well, a few people have.  I know this one.  I think it's a club here in New York, is it?  Or was it Massachusetts?  That had a big piece of the wall with the spray painting on it and everything, and actually 
[01:37:30]  put it in the bathroom.  And they put the urinals on it.  See, that would be kind of cool if it's a big chunk.  But I'm talking about this.  This was a piece that was just a little bigger than the marble.  What are you going to do with that?  Yeah, that's...  Some people take body parts.  I'd collect body parts.  Body parts?  Of famous people, yeah.  That would be kind of cool.  You walked around for the longest time with that goddamn finger bone on your necklace.  Yeah, well...  And it smelled...  And you used to just smell it. 
[01:38:00]  You'd sit there smelling it because it smelled a little like death.  Well, you're exaggerating a little.  No.  I was trying to smell death.  I didn't really smell death.  You were always sniffing it, though.  I was trying to smell death, yes.  I got rid of that.  Yeah.  That was cannibal jewelry from our old pal...  Yeah, cannibal wear.  Chuck Farnham.  Our old pal Chuck Farnham.  Chuck Farnham.  Who was a special, special individual.  He'd get...  He'd, like, send away...  Because you could get pieces of cadavers. 
[01:38:30]  And one thing you could get is little finger bones.  You know, the tips of the...  From the last knuckle to the fingertip.  And he would put them on necklaces.  And you would wear these things.  A human bone.  And he would call it cannibal wear.  And, yeah, it was pretty creepy that you were wearing that.  Yeah.  I can't do anything with people's body parts.  It just creeps me out.  Yeah.  That's...  During...  Patrick Munaki is saying,  Got any toes?  He could use one.  During our vacation, one of the papers had an article about all these famous body parts. 
[01:39:00]  It's funny that this guy brought it up.  And where these famous body parts are.  I wish I saved the article.  Maybe you can find that stunt brain.  Like John Dillinger's...  Yeah?  Actually...  That's supposed to be pretty big.  Actually, it was somebody's junk.  I forgot which famous person.  I think it was Dillinger's.  It was...  Maybe that's...  Not the one in this article.  And then they had Einstein's eyes.  They're just floating around somewhere.  Yeah.  Floating around.  Who wouldn't want Einstein's eyes in a jar?  That would be freaking cool.  Looking at you. 
[01:39:30]  Let's go to Mike in New York.  Mike?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, uh...  I'm with Ant on this one.  I served in Iraq.  And I took a bunch of souvenirs from there.  You know, flags and stuff.  Doesn't mean that I like them.  Ears?  Scalps?  I didn't take ears.  No, more hands and feet than anything.  Collecting war memorabilia from either an ally or an enemy is not signing off on what they did.  It's not embracing their ideology. 
[01:40:00]  It's just silly.  Silly.  If you have a Nazi flag hanging in your house and you, like, agree with Hitler's speech, it  doesn't matter if your Nazi flag is brand new.  You know, you embrace the Nazi ideology.  Yeah, where did you hide all that stuff during your pool party at?  Uh, actually, it was, um, on, uh, in the kitchen.  Was it?  But underneath, like, a basket.  I had to hide it.  And some of it was in the office.  And then, um, my lawn jockey is in the closet. 
[01:40:30]  I didn't buy these things.  Um, people give them to you.  Yeah, they give them to me.  And Keith thought it was very funny when I was on vacation once.  Um, the first day of my vacation, uh, he put a lawn jockey on my lawn.  So it sat there for a week.  And I came home and went, what the hell is that?  And there's a lawn jockey on my lawn.  And, uh, another friend, Joe, decided, uh, when I was on vacation during Christmas to put a giant menorah in my window. 
[01:41:00]  Uh, so our Jewish neighbors were very confused with Christmas lights and a menorah.  How did your friend Joe get into your house while you weren't there?  He was taking care of the cat.  Oh, all right.  It was the old days.  Stunt.  Day brain.  Uh, yes, sir.  There is a book that just came out called, uh, 2,500 Years of History Unzipped, Napoleon's Privates.  And it, uh, details where some of the great private parts and organs of history are housed.  Apparently Bonaparte's, uh, member was sold at auction in 1924. 
[01:41:30]  Bonaparte.  And now a, uh, urologist has bought it and has it on display as well as Che Guevara's hair was sold in 2007.  And, um, Lincoln's skull fragments, Beethoven's ear bones, Grover Cleveland's jaw lesions, and even poet Shelley's heart.  And there is a Kennedy collector outside of Baltimore who claims to have George Washington's finger.  That would be cool.  Yeah, the first finger.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  The first, the father of our country's finger. 
[01:42:00]  Part of Lincoln's brain?  Or, or the skull?  Maybe, yeah.  Come on.  The book just came out, so the guy's probably around doing a book tour.  It came out the last week of, uh, July.  Yeah, that'd be kind of cool to get that guy.  Yeah, let's get him on the show.  What was the, uh, what was the first piece of memorabilia you said there that was, uh...  Uh, Napoleon's...  Yeah, Napoleon's member.  The poor bastard.  How do you know it's his?  Yeah.  They can do DNA.  Supposedly have a giant one.  Really?  Yeah.  In this article, someone had a body part under their bed for, like, 20, 30 years. 
[01:42:30]  It was a real famous...  Yeah, but he's so short.  I wish I had the article.  Poor Napoleon.  No, he couldn't have had a baby.  Napoleon probably had a tiny, a tiny little mule, because that's why he had to conquer  the whole world.  Yeah.  Overcompensate.  Yeah.  He had a small penis and a Porsche.  A little chip on his shoulder.  All right.  Uh, back to school clothes.  Too sexy?  You want this?  I say no.  Let's do this, uh, really quick. 
[01:43:00]  There's two, uh, stories about sexy, sexy clothes.  We'll start with this one right here.  Well, back to school shopping is here, but when it comes to buying clothes, parents give  the fashion trend an F. Here's why.  Parents say that clothes meant for children and teenagers are just too sexy for school.  They're furious that kids as young as 12 are wearing such revealing clothes.  But just because-  This is a weird, like, phenomenon, by the way, because the kids themselves, they don't  think, some of them anyway, they don't think they're in really hot clothes. 
[01:43:30]  No.  It's just the trend that is happening, because Britney Spears started and now you got Hannah  Montana and the rest of them dressing ridiculously sexy and they're copying them, but they don't  realize what that does to guys, what they're wearing.  They have no clue.  No, they're just-  They really don't have a clue.  Yeah, they're just going with the trend.  But just because you don't see your teenager in the skimpy clothes, it doesn't mean she's  not wearing them.  Doesn't mean she's not a goer.  Yeah.  That slut's changing in the bathroom. 
[01:44:00]  That's right.  As soon as you drop her off.  Yeah.  But just because you don't see your teenager in the skimpy clothes, it doesn't mean she's  not wearing them.  A teenager told me she changes her clothes in the restroom when she gets to school.  Makes me absolutely furious as a mom.  Well, stinky stuff.  How can I put it?  I'm sorry.  I don't know how to put it.  Kids are just inundated with sexy imagery on the internet and TV, and one counselor says  teenagers think it's the norm, so they copy it.  He says the best thing you can do is set limits and consequences. 
[01:44:30]  I totally agree.  They're not doing it to look like a stripper or anything.  It's just what they're wearing these days.  It's just a good side effect of the whole thing.  And then, speaking of which, we go to the Disney faux pas.  They do this all the time.  They sell a lot of stuff with that sex thing.  Yeah.  Subliminal messages and all that.  We've done that break over the years.  You get an artist that did the cover of one of the videos for a cartoon, and like Aladdin. 
[01:45:00]  Aladdin had an obvious penis painted on the cover.  Did it?  Yeah.  Can we find that?  Where they had to pull it.  Not the, you know.  They actually, you know, pulled the product.  Yes.  Very good.  Well, Disney's at it again.  They got these musical panties.  Disney said on Friday that it has stopped selling a line of panties for girls after parents  of Britain complained about the message printed on them.  What does it say? 
[01:45:30]  Juicy?  It says dive in.  No way.  Yes, it does.  Kids underwear that says dive in.  It says dive in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  There's the picture of the penis.  That's tough to see, though, man.  I know.  It's pretty obvious.  Where is it?  What?  It's the big thing that looks like.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I got it.  Sure.  Yeah.  We'll throw that up on onaradio.com.  A disgruntled employee. 
[01:46:00]  So, the underwear made for tween girls.  Tween.  Invited the reader to dive in and was, according to company officials, theme for a swimming  pool scene from the Disney Channel hit movie, High School Musical 2.  Oh, so they just mean literally dive in the pool.  No, they know exactly what they're doing.  Yeah.  I mean, how does that get past everybody without one person going, wait a minute, you know.  Yeah.  No, that'll be our excuse.  That's what we're going to do.  When they ask us, we'll go, no, it's because of that, not this. 
[01:46:30]  Unfortunately, an oversight was made.  How do you make an oversight like that?  Oops.  Dive in.  Yeah, it's looking and going.  On little girl's panties.  Oversight was made and the text on the underwear was used out of context.  Man, someone is so fired over this.  Or maybe not, because now we're all talking about these panties.  Yeah.  It was supposed to read, dive into this young ****.  No?  Well, this product will not be part of any forthcoming collections and the remaining  product has been removed from shelves. 
[01:47:00]  So the children are once again safe from the dive-in panties.  Thank God.  Can't they just take the words dive in off them?  Yeah.  I'm sure that's what they're going to do, right?  Yeah.  Put something else on there.  No, they'll probably sell them at a cut rate price to like Bangladesh or something.  Maybe a bunch of little kids over there running around with Patriots Super Bowl jerseys.  We did that bit as a joke and then somebody out there, man, they really helped us out.  But they found pictures of everybody wearing all the Super Bowl champion Patriots gear that 
[01:47:30]  was supposed to be worn by everybody up there in Boston.  It was in some third world country.  They were walking around with Super Bowl champion Patriots.  In this third world country, the Patriots want to know the Super Bowl.  They don't know.  They don't know.  Well, they get it wrong every year because they get the other team.  Ulysses. 
[01:48:00]  Ulysses.  Ulysses.  Ulysses.  Ulysses.  Nice.  Were you named after Ulysses S. Grant, sir?  Yeah, and it's a coincidence.  I used to live in Virginia, so I had to hear it all the time.  Yeah, but were you named after him?  No.  I was actually born in Puerto Rico, so it was a...  He's probably named after some guy named Ulysses Snodgrass.  Some creep.  Why are Puerto Ricans being named after Civil War heroes?  Ulysses.  That is a little weird.  What is going on in Puerto Rico? 
[01:48:30]  I know.  My mom wanted to be different.  My dad just wanted me to have a normal Latino name like Alex or Carlos or something like that.  So they settled on Ulysses?  Ulysses.  How is that a compromise?  Well, in Spanish, it's Ulysses.  But in English, it's Ulysses.  And I had to hear it in Virginia from redneck people all the time about the Civil War and all that stuff.  Well, we bring it up today.  I'm sorry.  But what do you have there?  Well, going back to that memorabilia story, I got one for you. 
[01:49:00]  My friend, he just got out of the Army.  And he collected one of those Saddam bills off a dead insurgent.  And it had, like, the blood on it.  And one night, we got so high that we accidentally rolled it up and smoked it without even thinking.  So that douche that was trying to give you a hard time, I mean, we don't really think about it because I'm prior military myself.  And you'll be surprised with stuff we try to collect. 
[01:49:30]  All right.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you, sir.  A little Iraqi blood.  I got a little Saddam money when I was over there.  Yeah?  Could you bring it in for show and tell?  Yeah.  I don't know if it's legit.  Like, the stuff at the Baghdad airport, I didn't have much faith in.  Yeah.  Me and Colin took pictures with the guy who was selling, like, little trinkets there.  Yeah.  All right.  Didn't think it was real, though.  It was weird, like, going to the bathroom there.  I think I used one of the urinals or something.  It was bizarre.  Walking through that place that I know that in my life I never should have walked through. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, right?  I never should have been in the Baghdad.  Because you could see where it said Saddam Airport.  Yeah.  They had taken the word Saddam off, but the sun had kind of made...  They just removed airport.  Oops.  A little error.  They're not good spellers.  But the word Saddam was still there, but the letters were gone.  But walking through the airport, there was no one in there.  It was empty, except me, Colin, and some military guards.  My family coming in from Disney.  It really wasn't bizarre.  A lot of the continental flights were late. 
[01:50:30]  I was...  Where's my frequent flyer?  The President's Club.  It's a hangman's noose.  It was just bizarre.  Yeah.  Knowing that this was the airport, that, like, Saddam would have people come through.  It was just really a weird place to be, man.  Yeah, that is odd that you say that.  You know, you never should have been there.  That's true.  What I wanted to do was go on the...  There was a couple of planes, which when he...  When the U.S. invaded, I think, he had the engines taken off these commercial planes  so people couldn't leave the country. 
[01:51:00]  And they were sitting there at the gates with no engines.  Going nowhere.  I really wanted to go on the...  I know, it's probably the same condition they were in when the airport was in its...  Yeah.  In its pride.  There's still people sitting on there waiting.  I wanted to walk on one of the planes, but the guard said no.  Why?  I don't remember.  Maybe they weren't authorized to bring us there, or maybe we didn't have time.  Just go.  Just do it on your own.  Why don't we take a break?  We got the Bajork fan suicide audio.  We can do that.  We have the stillborn that came to life in the morgue. 
[01:51:30]  Oof.  And more of your phone calls.  Opian anthem.  All right, all right, all right.  What?  Louie.  Baton Rouge.  Hey, guys.  What's up, Louie?  Oh, man.  This is crap, man.  I'm stuck with friggin' Walton and Johnson now.  Walton and Johnson?  Those guys are great.  The one guy who does all the voices.  Yeah, he does a little fruit. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, is that it?  Yeah, exactly.  It's crap.  We've been stuck with them for like 30 years, and now we're back to them, I guess.  Yeah, we were kind of like downplaying it, but a lot of people calling from Baton Rouge.  Red Stick.  Yeah, we...  That's what they call it.  Red Stick.  Citadel, I guess they're teaching us some kind of lesson that we really don't know.  Yeah, we have no idea what it is.  We don't know what the lesson is, but they sure are teaching it to us.  They took us off another one of their radio stations.  We get it.  They don't want to do business with us. 
[01:52:30]  And they took us off a station in Baton Rouge.  And a lot of people call and they're not happy about it.  I guess you get the old satellite radio, my friend.  Get a little of that satellite radio in you.  I guess I'll have to get my iPhone and do What's the App.  Yeah, do a little What's the Apps or something.  You know, the bigger...  The big-time fans will find us.  I don't know what to tell you.  This Fareed, I guess he was a friend of ours.  I guess.  Yeah.  And something went down.  Something's going on.  And he decided not to pick up the phone and give us a little phone call to tell us what's going on. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  He's just doing it, you know.  Ah, he's the big guy in charge, so he can do whatever the hell he wants.  But, you know, I thought we had some kind of friendship where, you know, he could pick up the phone and go,  Hey, guys, it's not working or this or I need to do this or I need...  But, nah.  We find out when people call up and say, You're not on in this city anymore.  Yeah.  It's like, Oh, thanks.  Thanks for the heads up there, Fareed.  Way to go, Fareed.  Way to go.  We had a hell of a friendship, didn't we? 
[01:53:30]  It meant nothing to you.  Thanks, Louie.  All right, guys.  So we got this, the Bajork.  We talked about this.  We got the Bajork fan who committed suicide.  This was back in 96.  I thought this was a mere four or five years ago, but we're talking 12 years ago.  I guess that's when Bajork almost was famous.  She had that video with the big teddy bear chasing her through the woods.  Human behavior.  Human behavior.  Ah!  I don't like the Bajork. 
[01:54:00]  Nah.  I'm not into the Bajork music.  I was never a fan of that.  But this guy sure was.  What a creep.  And he sent her a bomb to kill her or something and let her.  What a scumbag.  Yeah.  So basically, if you weren't listening earlier, this creep decides to kill himself.  But in a very unique way, he mailed a package that Bajork was supposed to get that was going  to blow her up, basically, right?  Could we?  What?  Could we not have people try to correct us as to the pronunciation of Bjork?  We don't want to say it, right?  I think we understand her name is Bjork. 
[01:54:30]  It's for the people that linger longer.  That's how we always have said Bajork.  We always said her name sounds like the sounds you make when you puke.  Just the Bajork.  Bajork.  That's who we're talking about.  So this creep, he's going to kill himself at the exact time that Bajork was supposed  to.  Now it's going to be funny when we say Bajork.  Yeah.  He's going to be killed by one of these mail bombs that he sent, right?  A Bajom.  A Bajom.  He sent a Bajom to kill Bajork.  Bajork.  And then he killed himself.  Yeah.  With a gun. 
[01:55:00]  And are we allowed to link this video or is this a little too crazy for the stupid  lawyers?  There may need to be just a warning that violent content is there.  Oh, well, okay.  If you get that done, then I would officially say we're getting places there, Stunt Brain.  We're getting places.  So this guy shaved his head.  He put on some kind of tribal makeup on his face.  And he slowly but surely went through the whole suicide process.  And we got some of that audio.  See, apparently shooting yourself in the head is okay to put on the website. 
[01:55:30]  Perish the thought.  A naked woman is on the website.  That's the problem the lawyers have.  Yeah.  You could blow your brains out.  Yeah.  Doesn't matter.  But a naked woman, oh, that might disturb somebody.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ, people are stupid.  Because the lawyers are gay.  Well, we all know that.  I hate the lawyers.  I don't even acknowledge they exist anymore.  Why?  You don't understand how the lawyers are.  Do you have to take the FCC training online? 
[01:56:00]  No.  Why would they?  They don't acknowledge them here.  That bag of dicks?  No.  That was useless.  It's amazing.  As much as I talk on this show, it is amazing they wouldn't think.  I'm glad.  I don't want to take it.  But it's amazing that they wouldn't think, you know, you should probably take this.  They just don't.  Anthony and I get an email every once in a while.  Every quarter maybe.  I don't know.  It's FCC training.  And we have to answer questions.  Yeah.  It is the biggest waste of effing time. 
[01:56:30]  But I guess they're like justifying their jobs.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Or covering their.  I don't know why they do this.  To be honest with you.  It's a way to screw us.  Because then they have it on file that we took this test, went through all the hoops.  All the training.  And the training.  And now we know better.  Yeah.  So that if something happens on the air, they could turn around and go, you know, you can't plead ignorance here.  You knew better.  Yeah.  So we will now fire you.  Yeah.  And it's a way to protect their own ass. 
[01:57:00]  Also, it's a way for them to work less.  Because back in the day when we were doing the N.E.W. thing, we actually had to sit down with the lawyers.  And they actually had to go into some in-depth conversations with us and hand out other cases of radio guys getting in trouble.  Now, you know, they don't want to work just like anyone else out there.  So like, ah, online, online training, FCC.  An online test.  But the point of this is at the end of it, when you pass their FCC online training, these dopes that have no clue about anything that's real in this world, 
[01:57:30]  they actually have a certificate that they want you to print out.  That's right.  To prove that you passed.  And I guess they want you to display the certificate in your home or something.  Frame that thing and hang it up.  No, they don't.  I swear to God, Jimmy.  You're being ironic.  There's no certificate.  I swear.  There is a certificate.  You sit through their horse-ass test.  And then at the end, it's all exciting.  Like, congratulations, you passed. 
[01:58:00]  Blah, blah, blah.  Here's the certificate to print out.  Whoop-a-dee-doo.  That you pass, and it has your name on it.  What's the certificate?  Is it a picture of a guy with junk in his mouth?  Yeah.  It's to put over the glory hole.  But they-  Poke through.  But they have this as a serious thing.  Like, you're excited, and you would actually print this up.  Who would print this up?  I graduated.  Yeah, well, here's the Bajork fan suicide audio.  I hate this guy.  Okay, it's time. 
[01:58:30]  I've got my gun.  I just want to say that my last words, what are my last words?  Well, f*** the world.  That's my last words.  And f*** New York.  And her and her f***ing self.  The chances of it being entirely successful, like I said before, I'm not going to count  on it.  But nonetheless, it being out there, I consider it a great venture. 
[01:59:00]  Just shoot yourself.  I hate this guy.  Just pull the trigger.  He's babbling.  He's just a-  Just the fact that he tried to hurt her is why I hate him so much.  And why did he say F you to Bajork?  Yeah, the stalkers are like that.  Yeah, they're angry because-  She didn't send a letter back, I bet.  She should love him.  He's a fat pig.  She wouldn't like you if she worked in a deli, Fats.  Why don't you yell at him?  He's dead for 20 years.  I'm going to go to a gym.  I bet he's skinny now.  But I'm like addressing a man who painted his head and shot himself like he's mentally 
[01:59:30]  competent.  I'm talking to him-  Why don't you pull yourself up by your bootstraps?  I'm talking to him like he's an intern at Columbia Presbyterian.  What a fool I am.  Oh my God.  Did this guy say maybe the world even? 
[02:00:00]  Uh, yeah.  Like the pain and suffering that the-  What?  The world caused Bajork.  How's this going to help?  Um-  What are you doing?  I know, you're making an ass out of yourself.  Look outside.  You look like an idiot.  Go to Starbucks and get a latte.  Everything's going to be okay.  Have Bob Saget intro it and then put a laugh track under it. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  And this guy blew his brains out.  Womp womp.  He's a $10,000 winner.  What is he doing?  It's like-  Shooting himself.  I'm making it up to you.  It's almost like she's going to feel bad and go, all right, well, at least he did this.  Yeah.  I feel bad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, oh, he called her a blank lover?  Yes.  Blank lover.  Ah.  She was dating a blank and this guy didn't like that.  Is that what's going down?  Oh.  Oh boy.  All right.  Suddenly he's a little more sane. 
[02:01:00]  Is that what we're led to believe?  No, he's just a-  He knew that she was getting it good.  Yeah.  Oh, he knew that they got it.  Well, that angered him.  Putting it to her.  Sure.  Well, uh, should we warn the people that this next clip might be a little, uh-  Nope.  Saucy.  Saucy, literally, like tomato sauce.  Yes.  Wow, is that a topless bajork?  Where?  Hey.  Hey, come on.  Get out of town.  I think there's some juxtaposition.  That's not bajork naked.  I think it was juxtaposed. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  Is she still doing music or is she still-  Who knows?  Yeah, a little midget.  Is she short?  Yeah.  Who knows?  How tall is Bjork?  Quickly, in answer.  Two feet.  She just likes to wear silly things.  That's what I know about bajork.  And make her hair into, like, freaking danishes and stuff.  Look, there's a danish shot.  Is that how hard is it?  Yeah, it is.  What is she doing?  Why don't you stop with the neck brace, put a hat on, wear a Mets hat, do a song, whore.  What are you doing?  That guy killed himself for that.  This nutty bitch who can't pick a hairstyle. 
[02:02:00]  Let's go to Mike in Fort Drum.  We were bitching about our FCC thing.  I guess the Army has you guys doing silly stuff, too, huh?  Really?  Hey, morning, guys.  What's up, Mikey?  Hey, that's all we have to do.  We get hit with so much online training, and there's always a certificate that you've got  to print out and provide to your supervisor.  And some of this training takes hours.  It's ridiculous.  And all it is is check-the-block stuff. 
[02:02:30]  It's just CYA for the brass, basically.  Oh, he was trained, you know, and so they can hold you responsible if you mess up.  And it's true, you could print up a certificate at the end?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Some of them are in color.  Some of them look pretty fancy schmancy.  Huh.  Oh, my God.  The Army.  Jesus.  It's so weird, too, because the certificates I've gotten have all been awards I've won.  I have a certificate printed out for sweetest boy in town.  I don't think you won that.  I did.  How old were you? 
[02:03:00]  From ages 13 to 29.  And boy, most likely to brighten your day.  I won that one.  Boy.  It's obvious you're in a new competition.  Gayest mustache ever.  Oh.  I keep forgetting I have it.  I keep forgetting.  We haven't forgotten.  The latest mustache picture is up on onaradio.com.  I'm going to take one every day.  Jimmy's trying to get to Friday with his mustache.  I have a cute smiling picture on my MySpace one.  Oh, it's adorable.  It's a handsome mustache pick.  Bajork is 5'4"? 
[02:03:30]  Yes, sir.  Oh.  She was born in 65.  I didn't realize she was.  She's 43.  I think she's 25.  I'm an idiot.  She was around, you know, back in the 90s.  She's been around hacking it up for many years.  I can't even name one Bajork song.  I can't either.  And I did a lot of music radio.  That one that we just.  Yeah, this one.  Nice paint.  This is her big hit.  This is her big hit.  Yeah, this is the big teddy bear walking through the woods.  If you ever get close to a human. 
[02:04:00]  He shot himself for this broad.  All right, I'm going to challenge you, Ant.  I think there was a more popular song than this.  Huh.  I don't know.  She stinks.  Yeah, more popular?  I think so.  When I think Bajork, I don't think this song.  How is this a hit anywhere? 
[02:04:30]  In Iceland.  We've got to find a bigger hit than this.  She's terrible.  This is like a big hit.  Yeah, I'm just going to challenge you.  I think there's another song.  She actually had a box set?  She had a box set?  Give me a list of Bajork songs, because now I've got to show some Bajork knowledge.  I'm going to find one that was more popular than this, Ant, I think. 
[02:05:00]  All right.  Good luck to you.  Oh, Stunt Brain is in.  Album, singles.  Army of Me was pretty big.  Army of Me?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Find Army of Me.  I want to shoot myself now, but not for the same reasons Fatso did.  Dolt.  Try Army of Me.  Wow.  Maybe I don't know crap about her.  Yeah, a few people said that on instant feedback.  Let's hear Army of Me.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:05:30]  What?  Never heard of it, sir.  What is she doing?  She has a B, a J, a K in her name with the two dots over the O. She has one vowel in her name. She's horrible.  I give you an A for effort, but what are you doing? How is this a popular song?  I don't know what this one is.  I don't either, Ant.  I'm just trying. Let's see when it kicks in.  Travis, do you know the big B, a Jork song?  She had one.  I thought that was it. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, I know. I suck.  Oh, so quiet.  What?  It's not in the big system, huh?  People are saying oh, so quiet was the big one there, Anthony.  We're stuck in B, a Jork hell.  She's terrible.  I don't know.  I think that human behavior one is the big one.  I remember the video.  Like, that's when she was at her peak.  At least the listeners could get out of B, a Jork hell.  They could just turn the dial. 
[02:06:30]  We're stuck in B, a Jork hell.  What happened to Fiona Apple?  Oh, she was so tortured, the poor girl.  Where did she go?  She's still doing it.  After she did Criminal.  She had a cool video, actually, for Nothing's Gonna Change My World.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, it's a cool video.  Criminal was a good video.  I mean, a lot of sex and sweat going on in that.  She was banging, oh, yeah, I tell you about Paul Thomas Anderson.  Yeah?  I'm the director for the Boogie Night.  She was like, oh, okay.  Oh.  Earth Intruders, Pieces of You.  Can we find a bigger B, a Jork song, the big hit? 
[02:07:00]  I mean, Anthony's gonna win this.  Yes.  Let's say hi to Marie Long Island.  Marie.  Hey, Marie.  Hey.  I work for the local cable company on Long Island.  Yeah.  And we also have to take the online ethics and sexual harassment training and print out  our little graduation certificates at the end.  Oh.  Apparently, people don't know that you're not supposed to pin your secretary up against  the desk.  What?  My brother had me laughing. 
[02:07:30]  He's got a great new concept.  I was hanging out with my brother Scott and the gang out there in, way out there on Long  Island.  He goes, instead of sensitivity training, they should have insensitivity training.  How brilliant is that, though?  Just what show.  Why do we have to change?  Get these prises and teach them how the real world works and make them go through insensitivity  training.  How to handle it.  Where you just, you know, that stupid secretary that's not willing to get a pinch every once  in a while.  You throw her through the insensitivity training.  You teach her how to not spill coffee if her rack is being squeezed angrily. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, exactly.  I laugh so hard, and then I'm thinking, you know what?  It's kind of brilliant.  It really is.  Because why?  I mean, the reality is that it's a minority of people out there that are getting offended,  and the rest of us are suffering.  So bring the minority into the majority, and force them to live in our demonic world.  Train them to take the, what, the hand on the ass?  All that.  Yeah.  The purple nurple. 
[02:08:30]  Force them to, you know, put their boobies on the copier.  Just hang up the most insensitive crap in your cubicle.  But force them to.  Yeah.  You know.  That they have to also.  I really think it's brilliant.  As much as he was going for the joke, I'm like, you know what?  Yeah, why do we have to?  Yeah.  Why do we have to do this crap?  You should make the tapes.  You'd make a fortune.  Cleese made a fortune doing office training videos that were funny.  You guys could make a killing.  Yeah.  What else can we do for insensitivity training? 
[02:09:00]  Racial insensitivity, of course.  Oh, yeah.  Just force them to just.  And just start yelling the word.  Have to just.  You just.  Everywhere you go, you're just telling the most insensitive jokes.  Yeah.  At the water cooler.  Yeah.  Hey, did you hear the one about the.  And the.  Someone's saying that sensitivity training was on Penn and Teller's BS.  But my brother's too poor to have cable.  So I think he didn't get that from that. 
[02:09:30]  So here's the audio of the guy finally shooting himself over.  Right.  By the way, he waited to the end of the Bajorque song.  Everything was very, very calculated with this guy.  Trying to see if it got any better.  Yeah.  When it didn't.  Kaplowy.  Just leave and go to a movie or something.  Cut it out.  What are you doing?  Do a shit up, fat boy.  I can't breathe.  I will send them free. 
[02:10:00]  I will send them free.  Did he knock over something? 
[02:10:30]  Boo!  What did he say right before he pulled the trigger?  Something like, like, sir!  I think it was some kind of bachork nonsense.  Or was it?  Can I see how smart Anthony is?  What?  It didn't even occur to me that when he fell forward, he might have knocked something over.  Yeah, he might have knocked a beverage over.  Like, he might have had a can of soda or something.  Yeah, I mean, it could be blood.  We've all seen Arbor Dwyer, and it really did pour out his nose. 
[02:11:00]  But, uh, I don't know, that really was kind of pouring.  But did you hear the noise he made after he went, oh!  Yeah.  He, he, there was a noise that came out, he felt it.  That's ow!  He felt...  Yeah, that was, ow!  Why did I do that?  We've been pretty morbid the past couple of days.  I know.  Not...  Oh, what do you got there, young Samuel?  Are we gonna get out of bachork hell by playing her biggest hit? 
[02:11:30]  Oh, this is it?  I apologize that we went into bachork hell here.  What happened, uh, Samuel?  She hasn't had this, uh, much attention, um, ever.  Since, uh, old Fatty blew his brains out.  Yeah.  So she attacked that reporter.  Oh, right.  That's a classic video.  Why did she?  Yeah.  She just flipped out.  I don't know.  She was just sick of the paparazzi taking her picture.  Taking pictures of her baby, I think.  Yeah.  Because she's freaked out.  Because she's a tortured artist.  Yeah.  Shut up!  Just go away!  Hey!  Morbid Jewelry. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, yes.  This is from, uh, a deodorant commercial.  Stinks.  It's oh so quiet.  It's oh so still.  No.  This isn't bigger than...  Nope.  It's huge.  No.  Human behavior.  Anthony, there's another one.  I'm telling you.  And so peaceful until... 
[02:12:30]  You fall in love, peaceful.  The sky is...  What the hell year is it?  Christy Yamaguchi skated for this in a gold medal routine.  Oh!  Thank you, Stunt Brain.  Who did?  Christy Yamaguchi, the American gold medalist and great champion.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  It's over.  I suddenly love Bjork.  Why? 
[02:13:00]  Because I'm watching her attack a reporter.  Oh, yeah.  She really went at it.  She's an animal, that's for sure.  And it's amazing how none of the other scumbag reporters tried to help the other one.  They just filmed it.  Yeah.  They're just pigs.  They love it.  They're hyenas.  You know how bad you would look if you help your buddy out as he's getting beaten up by a girl?  No, it was a woman.  It was a woman.  Yeah.  Oh, it was a woman.  Look at her just socking her in the head.  Nice.  What year was this?  It's about, what, four, five, six years?  Seven, eight, nine?  I love it. 
[02:13:30]  I love when you just give out too many numbers.  Sure.  Why don't we throw this up on oneradio.com?  Why don't we?  Is there any bigger sign of stupidity when someone gives out the higher number first?  It's got to be between, like, ten and six years ago.  People pointing out that she does have a vowel in her name.  Who cares?  I said there was only one.  He said there was one.  I said there was one vowel.  I know what an O is.  All right.  I said it's got the two dots over the O.  Whoever's saying I didn't imply it was a vowel is a vowel.  Yeah, but the two dots over the O makes it not a vowel anymore. 
[02:14:00]  Stunt brain?  Tell him.  I don't know.  It's Icelandic.  I question it.  The two dots makes it a consonant.  Does it?  Yep.  Tell him.  I have to learn on this one.  They love J's and K's.  Reykjavik is a big place.  She's huge points in Scrabble with the K's and the J.  That's ten points each letter.  Yeah, but you can't.  No, K is five points and the J is eight.  I hate to correct people.  You do know Scrabble's for queers, right?  B is three.  Wow.  R is one.  Queers.  R is one.  Scrabble's for queers.  Dave Gay Scrabble? 
[02:14:30]  Scrabble stinks.  I love it.  I hate it.  I can't spell worth the crap, first of all.  There's no spell check on Scrabble.  You play against those people that know those dumb little two-letter words that give you  a million points.  I have the whole rack and I cannot get one word out of it.  And the stupid timer is going.  That little ancient hourglass is going and I'm sitting there going, I can't make a word. 
[02:15:00]  I don't know.  I don't know how to spell.  The sands of time, my friend.  Yes.  Like the sands in an hourglass.  I'm sorry, man.  It's okay, Jimmy.  I said the attack was 96, he's saying.  So I wonder if it was a question about the suicide or something.  Oh, wow.  That was a fun year for her, huh?  She had fans killing herself.  She's attacking people.  Yeah.  Tomorrow, for the people out there, help us out.  I think this insensitivity training thing that we kind of touched on could be a lot of  fun because I know I know I'm not alone where I hate the human resources department. 
[02:15:30]  HR has no business in radio whatsoever.  Puffing stuff?  HR and lawyers have no business in radio whatsoever.  Mm-hmm.  This dumb business was a bunch of guys getting high playing songs.  Why has it come to the point where we have to meet with human resources and sit down with  lawyers?  Go away.  So we'll talk about it.  Get out of my way.  We'll talk about sensitivity training tomorrow, human resource departments, all that crap. 
[02:16:00]  Hope they can get that stuck in your head.  Oh, yes.  They're a stunt branch.  And the O with the double dots over it is referred to as an umlaut.  Sure.  And I do believe it is a vowel according to several sources.  Of course it is.  I'm just messing with you.  Oh.  Well, thanks for making me learn.  Okay.  We'll see you next time. 
[02:16:30]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show where I was walking in and I saw Steve giving Master  Poe a talking to.  What?  Yeah.  You know, at the end of the other show, we kind of touched on it, but I'm serious. 
[02:17:00]  This is just a dumb radio show.  It's a dumb business.  No one takes this stuff too seriously for the most part.  Not the people that are actually doing the show.  We defend our show and all that.  But I mean, if you really think about it, it's just a dumb profession.  It really is.  And it all started with a bunch of guys just smoking weed and hanging out and playing records.  Now you got lawyers and corporate and human resources involved. 
[02:17:30]  The latest thing is our interns who work for free, who commute using their own money, they're  not allowed up here because their internships ended.  These fucking guys want to continue working because they want to continue learning.  They want to make sure they keep their face in the whole thing just in case a job opens.  Sure.  And we're not allowed to have, look, they're marching out.  Who's making our interns leave?  They're marching the fuck out.  Who is making our interns leave? 
[02:18:00]  Dude, when I started in this business, which granted was a long time ago, I lived at radio  stations, lived at them.  And I soaked up everything.  But there's some kind of dumb policy down in Washington where, where the interns after  their internship is over, they have to, they're not allowed to be here.  It's probably some fucking whore insurance stuff.  And what the fuck?  And Master Poe, you know, he's not one of us.  I'm sorry, Poe.  You're not one of us.  You suck. 
[02:18:30]  Why are you making them leave?  Master Poe is instead of like, all right, well, you know, let them fucking stay here.  They're working for, they're getting our fucking coffee.  Let the kids play.  Let the kids play.  Let the kids.  Who, who thought this was a good idea down there in Washington?  What dopey fucking lawyer thought this was a good idea?  And what are they protecting against?  One of these kids falling and cracking their head or something?  Is it an insurance thing?  So who do we have right now looking for us? 
[02:19:00]  I'm sure it all has to do with insurance.  Who do we have doing stuff for us?  The whole, the, the, the staff that's on, that's on the payroll.  We have no interns.  No, we have no interns.  Why don't we have just marched out?  But I mean, why don't we have new ones?  Because the, the way it works is there's a, there's always a gap in between the end  of the previous intern period and the beginning of the new one.  What fucking asshole is in charge of interns?  I've never understood it, but it's always been like that.  Well, why don't they send the fucking dummies who are being paid up from Washington to do this?  I don't, why would they care?  If people want to work for free. 
[02:19:30]  Dude, it's the subject of countless emails that I have written and bitched about.  With who?  The people in D.C.  With who?  Who's the guy in charge of interns?  Who?  Who is he?  Who?  His name is Ross and he's not working today, so I can't get him on the phone.  And he's, again, he's just following company policy.  Who do we have to, who goes above him?  Who?  We don't have a company.  Who's at the top?  I don't know.  I don't know who's at the top anymore.  We don't even have a company.  I don't know who's at the top of this whole thing.  That means nothing.  Sirius took us over.  What's their policy?  Was today the first day that we weren't allowed to have them here? 
[02:20:00]  No, this happens every fucking semester.  It happens every semester.  And we send them out every time?  And we do this break every fucking semester and nothing gets done.  These guys want to work for free.  When I was their age, I worked for free because I knew that I could learn something.  And a job might open up.  Dozens of independently owned radio companies back then.  These fucking guys are using their own money to come down here.  They're working for free and they're not even allowed to do that.  Wait a minute.  The corporate is saying, you're not allowed to use your own money and work for free.  I'm sorry.  How about this?  What the fuck?  We want them as guests today. 
[02:20:30]  Tried that one.  Didn't work.  I tried that one.  Whoa, what do you mean?  Says who?  Says DC.  Well, DC has no say over who our guests are.  Apparently they do.  The interns are still in the hallway.  So why are they making this a real sticking point instead of just going, all right, go ahead.  I don't know.  Can I ask a question?  Yeah.  How come we could have strangers come in off the street, but we can't have people that  we know come up and just chill?  Believe me, these are all valid questions.  Can we grab someone off the street and make them an intern today? 
[02:21:00]  We'll just have them fill out paperwork.  Well, that guy came in today.  We got one guy in there.  Dude, you're going to be an intern.  We have one listener today.  Have Master Poe get our fucking coffee and stuff there.  Yeah, why can't they come in as guests?  Just spit in this.  Try that one.  Believe me, and it was...  Wait, if I want to talk to Bob on the air right now, we can't...  What the fuck is this?  What are you talking about?  I know.  It's ridiculous.  I don't believe that.  I don't believe we can't have them as a guest.  I was going over this all...  And why was this not...  Like, how come...  Why is this happening all of a sudden?  And why did nobody call this... 
[02:21:30]  It happens every semester.  I mean, why was it yesterday when the guy was in the office?  Why are we dealing with this on the air now instead of yesterday when this was  going to happen today?  Because it had, because the email chain started after the show ended, basically, and that  was...  Okay, well, how come the guy didn't...  We didn't talk to the guy on the phone.  So does this guy have an idea for us what we're supposed to do without interns?  Because, you know, as much as we make fun of these guys, they're very valuable to the  show.  So this guy decided that we can't have those interns, so what is the game plan?  When are we getting our new interns?  Just to do shitty radio or something?  I haven't even started interviewing the next batch of interns yet, but we have just started 
[02:22:00]  getting the applications.  We're trying to get the ones that are carrying over to get their paperwork finished.  And that's...  And why are we listening to Tech Sam at this?  But they're nobodies.  They got taken over.  This wasn't a merger.  This was a takeover.  So what is Sirius' policy on this?  Exactly.  Because that's what I acknowledge now.  Not these dopes down in Washington.  I'll go find out.  Can we call somebody...  I can't believe we're handling this now.  Didn't we know when the time was up, though?  It's every semester, and we try to do something, Jimmy. 
[02:22:30]  We try to do something every semester.  It always happens.  And we try to, like, get them to extend it, but it never works.  Can we pay them for their, you know, give them, like, $10, and then they get to stay  because now they're being paid?  I wonder if that'll work.  Try that one.  Why not?  We'll give them $10 each to work for the day.  Right.  Let's see if that works.  Thank God.  Leave wages.  Thank God I have no money in my wallet today.  How about that?  We want to give them $10 each to work.  How about these shit dicks in Washington leave the fucking show alone? 
[02:23:00]  We know what we're doing.  Why is Poe fucking being so hardcore about it?  Just let him in.  Because Poe, he's a corporate guy.  He makes believe he blends in with us, but he's not one of us.  Sorry, Poe, but you're not.  Fucking annoying, man.  They're just standing in the hallway, by the way.  It's amazing how selective some people are about a fucking...  Here's Tony, who's been working for free for two years.  Tony, you're in the hallway just standing there?  Yeah, you guys all right?  You want us to go downstairs and maybe get something?  Yeah, I'm kind of thirsty.  Maybe you could get something and just leave it at the door and knock a couple times. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, all right.  I can get you something.  I'll bring it home and knock.  Tony, has this happened to you before?  This has happened once before where nobody was allowed in for a couple hours,  and then I think we got it squared away, but never to this extent where it was...  Tony's been working for the show for free for two years, and this is how they...  This is how they...  What fucking shit?  They take care of him.  Tony.  They say, now you can't be here for free.  Tony.  It's unbelievable. 
[02:24:00]  Can you do me a favor?  Can you go run to Staples real quick and print me out some instant feedback?  You got it, buddy.  Thanks.  Run to Staples.  And just slide it under the door.  So who's doing it?  Is Poe going to do instant feedback?  Poe, well, he just came to talk to us.  He's standing by the door.  I didn't hear what he said there.  What is he doing?  What did you say, Poe?  I'm waiting for him.  He's waiting to hear.  He's waiting what?  Company man.  He's waiting to hear back.  I think I upset him. 
[02:24:30]  It's interesting, though, how selective some people are about it.  I can see if somebody's a strict company man all the time, but it's amazing how people  will bend the rules of the company when it benefits them.  Like, you can't bend them now to let these guys in.  But if it's to do something that's convenient for other people, like leave early one day,  that's different.  I don't even acknowledge that XM exists at this point.  All my XM numbers on my phone went bye-bye.  I just want to know who the guy is.  It's some bullshit insurance thing. 
[02:25:00]  They're not insured to be up there because the insurance will only cover, you know,  just more fucking scumbags in the insurance industry.  Just more fucking scumbags.  Absolutely.  Corporate.  All right, Tony.  Have fun in the hallway.  I'll be out here.  Call me if you need me.  I never liked you anyway.  Stay in the fucking hallway.  I'm kidding, Tony.  Throw yourself down the elevator shaft.  Yeah, really.  I'm sorry you shot yourself during that Bjork video.  Visual humor on the radio. 
[02:25:30]  Hopey and Anthony starring Jim Dorn.  Shepard Smith said cunt.  Did he?  Oh, yeah, he did.  What?  Again?  A couple weeks old, but I think we were on vacation when this went down.  I think he said that once before.  Says cunt, then explains why he said it.  They said probably, name something you'll never eat.  They genuinely believe is going to uncover tens of millions of dollars in health care fraud. 
[02:26:00]  Wow.  Jonathan Cunt live in our Southern California newsroom.  He was on this Thursday, August the 7th.  No, that's his name is Cunt.  He just called him Jonathan Cunt.  It's not.  No one ever pronounces coont or coonts or anything like that with the cunt.  I've told the story many times about Anita Cunt.  Right, right.  The fine hot woman I used to caddy for at the Huntington Crescent Club.  The caddy.  I don't even think his name was spelled with a hard K. 
[02:26:30]  I think it was like, I might be wrong, but I think it was just like Hunt or something.  There was no reason for there to even be a hard K sound.  He's going to explain why he did this.  Jonathan Cunt live in our Southern California newsroom.  Someone dropped something when he said it was Thursday, August.  Of course they dropped something.  Did you hear like the crash when he said cunt?  Is it Jonathan K. Hunt or something?  No, that was the program director of the show dropping dead of a heart attack.  You said what?  I got two kids I got to get through college. 
[02:27:00]  We're so fired.  Live in our Southern California newsroom.  Oh, wait, we didn't.  Hold on a minute there.  In health cat fraud show.  Jonathan Cunt live in our Southern California newsroom.  He was once.  This Thursday, August the 7th, 2008.  Did you see Jonathan Hunt's report earlier in this newscast?  The producer in the booth behind.  Oh, there's a segue there?  Okay.  All right.  So the first part is him saying it.  And then obviously later on in the show, that's where you hear the fade. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah.  He has to go back on the air and explain that he, uh, I'm guessing it's Jonathan K. Hunt  or something like that.  Oh, my God.  Well, let's see.  All is in health cat fraud show.  Jonathan Cunt live in our Southern California newsroom.  He was once.  This Thursday, August the 7th, 2008.  Did you see Jonathan Hunt's report earlier in this newscast?  The producer in the booth behind me is Jonathan Glenn.  So I was talking to Jonathan Glenn, and then I was about to thank Jonathan Hunt, and I said,  Jonathan, you get it.  I don't think he said that. 
[02:28:00]  How is it not a findable offense?  He said cunt on the air.  Dude, he's saying he said Jonathan Gunt because he was going to talk to Jonathan Glenn.  So he went, Jonathan Gunt.  Yeah.  No, that was, he said cunt.  Yeah.  Hey, by the way, I want to do the British Bob bit today.  So now this dog shit that they're doing is affecting us on the air.  Exactly.  Yeah.  And how, first of all, how are we only taking care of this last minute? 
[02:28:30]  Like how are phone calls not made Monday?  We should know, or last Friday, how do we not know that this is going to happen today,  Tuesday, whatever today's date is, August 19th?  It's Tuesday.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Tuesday.  What did we got?  Tuesday.  Sorry.  Like I said, I got, I started getting informed about this yesterday after the show.  We should know the cutoff date for interns, don't we?  It's not a mystery.  No, it's not a mystery, but it's usually just they give it out at the beginning of the semester  and then it's one of those things that gets lost in the shuffle. 
[02:29:00]  And we never really paid attention to it in the past, to be honest with you.  All right, but the fact that it wasn't handled is why we're in this situation right now.  It can't get handled, unfortunately.  How does it get handled when the cutoff date ends?  There's always going to be this nebulous period of like, you know, a month where we don't  have any interns.  What, um, what did you say about getting them getting paid?  Uh, I'm waiting for a call back from, uh...  Who'd you call?  Bruce.  Bruce?  Yeah.  Bruce who?  Um, Bruce.  Can you call us?  Yeah.  Oh, whatever.  Uh, Chris.  We can't get anybody on the phone for this.  Chris. 
[02:29:30]  Not yet.  I just talked to him.  Chris.  Hey.  Gotcha.  Hey, I won't let those interns in there, but he'll have 40 fucking criminals up there  when he does his own show.  Yeah, no kidding.  That's the hypocrisy of all this.  We had guys that spent some hard years in the joint up here.  But a stupid intern that wants to work for free and get us our dumb coffee isn't allowed  to.  Is Kenny allowed up here?  He probably isn't.  Is Kenny helping out?  But he's not really allowed to be up here, you know, following those rules, because he's 
[02:30:00]  not an XM employee officially.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Interesting rules.  They don't seem to really be rules, you know?  For them to tell us we can't have Bob on the air to discuss this as a guest is fuck...  Who said no to that?  Who said no to that?  Uh, the intern coordinator.  What's his name?  His name's Ross.  Oh, okay.  This is an intern coordinator?  What is that?  What's the show?  What's he doing?  Uh, he's not at work today.  He's not.  How are you off on a fucking Tuesday?  Who takes their day on Tuesday?  Dude. 
[02:30:30]  But the point, because we started earlier...  I started on radio.  There was no intern coordinator.  There was one intern that said, well, need more interns.  I'll go find some of my buddies.  Dig some up.  Now there's an intern coordinator?  What does he coordinate?  Why can't we call a cell phone?  Interns.  But how do you coordinate an intern?  I don't know.  Hey, Mel, I found some more money for you.  Get rid of the intern coordinator.  That'll save him.  I bet you he makes about 100 Gs, too. 
[02:31:00]  We're not allowed to, like, just go and solicit for our own...  Like, they have to contact, like, XMDC before they can be our intern.  So we're not allowed to just go get our own interns.  We have to wait for them to send us prospective interns before we are then allowed to further the process.  Oh, really?  So, yeah, they have us by the balls like that so that when we get stuck...  We know that we're going to run out of interns.  It's just that if they don't send us...  What's his name?  Ross Horosian.  If they don't send us applicants, then there's nothing we can do.  We can't just pull people up.  The applicant is a bum. 
[02:31:30]  So we knew that this was going to happen.  I'm saying we didn't...  To Mel Karmazin.  We didn't start doing anything.  Let's see.  Intern problem.  I demand...  Request.  Request?  Yeah, get more flies with vinegar than the honey.  How about we start with, I realize you're trying to figure out how to save money with the new company.  I realize that you are cost-cutting.  No.  That's kind of corporate.  You know what? 
[02:32:00]  While...  Liquidating.  That's more accurate.  I understand you're trying to get rid of the dead weight.  I like that.  Yes.  Oh.  I understand you're trying to find more money to pay us.  Oh, that's good.  Oh, very good.  Killed two birds with one stone there.  Nice.  And we will help you find that money.  By helping you get rid of the dead weight.  Too early.  Something about cost-cutting. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, okay.  Something about...  What do we got so far?  Now I'm all confused.  Okay.  I got to Mel Karmazin.  Subject.  Subject.  Cost-cutting.  Cost-cutting.  He'll open that.  Well, I wrote in subject, I am God.  Is that good?  No.  No, because you probably think it's spam.  Yeah.  It'll go in a spam folder.  Just cost-cutting.  Cost-cutting.  Hold on.  Cost.  And by the way, for the people that don't believe that we're actually going to send this,  you're delusional.  Cost-cutting.  How do you spell cutting?  Two Ts or one?  K-U-T-T-I-N-G. 
[02:33:00]  All right.  I'm going to put an N in there and make believe I made a mistake.  Cost-cutting.  Okay.  Cost-cutting.  Subject, cost-cutting.  Yes, Jimmy.  Go ahead.  We have figured out.  We here at the Opie and Anthony program.  We here.  Have figured out a way for the company.  What are you?  I'm not a secretary.  Oh.  Opie and Anthony program.  Mm-hmm.  Have figured out.

Responsible.  All right.  To get our dick beaters on more cash.  To.  We might have to taunt at that a little bit.  All right.  Executive here.  Although I'm keeping cost-cutting.  Because I think that's like.  But you're.  But you're writing to the CEO. 
[02:34:00]  All right.  To get our meat hooks into some more moolah.  That's one way to get.  All right.  Our meat hooks.  Hooks.  Into what?  More moolah.  Moolah.  M-O-L-A-H.  I got it.  Okay.  I got to go exclamation point after that.  Have to.  Just one, though.  All right.  I know you're not a big fan of the exclamation point.  Yeah.  Especially when you're writing to a CEO.  It should be business letter-ish.  Yes. 
[02:34:30]  Yes.  It has to sound official.  All right.  Oh, I spelled Anthony with an M.  Hold on, man.  Oh, shit.  It's all right.  Anthony.  Amp-thuh-y.  Amp-thuh-y.  All right.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Moolah.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Whatever monies.  M-O-N-I-E-S.  Whatever.  Monies.  M-O-N-I-E-S.  The use of the word monies.  I love it.  Whatever monies.  Are currently being.  Are flushed.  Currently.  Being.  Flushed.  Um. 
[02:35:00]  How do we put this?  Flushed down.  Flushed down.  The turlet.  The.  I want to write the turlet.  The shitter.  Yeah, flushed down.  Yeah, flushed down the turlet.  I like turlet.  The turlet.  T-I-R-L-E-T.  Turlet.  And then put in parentheses.  Yeah.  Also known as.  Also.  No.  Intern coordinator salary.  Intern coordinator.  I'm going to CC.  I'm going to CC and blind CC the entire company, by the way. 
[02:35:30]  Also known as intern coordinator.  Yeah.  Position.  Yeah.  Also known as intern coordinator.  I can't.  Intern coordinator.  In parentheses.  Yep.  How does that go?  Whatever monies are currently being flushed down the turlet.  Also known as intern coordinator.  Salary.  Intern coordinator salary.  Intern coordinator's salary.  Salary.  Yep.  Okay.  Money.  Whatever.  Yes.  Can be put into our checks.  How about we use allocated?  Yes.  We haven't used a last word in a while. 
[02:36:00]  Can be allocated.  Can be allocated.  Towards our raises.  Towards.  Ours.  I would think.  Our.  Can be allocated toward on air talent.  I.E.  The Opie and Anthony program.  You're killing me.  According to someone.  Can be allocated toward what?  On air talent.  Toward.  Specifically.  On air.  Talent. 
[02:36:30]  Specifically.  The Opie and Anthony program.  Is that what I.E. means?  I don't know.  The.  Opie and Anthony program.  Again.  Okay.  Okay.  Wait.  Now how does that one sentence go?  Whatever monies are currently.  Hold on.  I'm going to.  Hold on.  I'm going to.  I'm going to proofread now for everybody.  This is what we got so far.  All right.  To Mel Karmazan.  Subject.

[02:37:00]  Get our meat hooks.  Into more.  Moolah.  Moolah.  Fucking.  Moolah.  Whatever monies.  These are currently being flushed down the turlet.  Also known as intern coordinator salary can be allocated toward on air talent.  Specifically the Opie and Anthony program.  And then put a comma.  Mm hmm.  When.  Mm hmm.  That bum.  When that bum.  Is fired.  Is fired.  With no compensation package. 
[02:37:30]  With no compensation package.  Probably a run on sentence.  Yeah.  Should I write please alert us so we could watch the hilarity ensue?  No.  Because I don't think we're kidding.  Yeah.  He has to know that this is serious business.  All right.  All right.  So far so good I think.  What's Orbicast?  Yeah.  Computer stuff.  I got it Danny.  Don't worry about it.  I can't find it because my computer.  Opie and Anthony program when that bum is fired with no compensation package. 
[02:38:00]  Yes.  Okay.  A new sentence.  When that bum is fired with no compensation package.  Okay.  What's the point of this again?  I don't remember.  To get interns.  Well the point is to get this dope fired.  Well they might put someone else in his place.  So it's the position that needs to be eradicated.  Yeah.  Now we also suggest that the position is.  We'd also like to suggest in the strongest of terms. 
[02:38:30]  That this position be eradicated as were the Nazis.  To what?  We would like to strongly.  That's not going to make sense.  Yeah that this position be eradicated due to it's complete uselessness to the company. 
[02:39:00]  Hmm.  Yes.  It has become an anchor around the neck of this organization.  An albatross.  An albatross.  Everyone knows it's an albatross.  And it will drag us all down into the financial abyss.  We would like to also suggest that this position is eradicated.  This position be eradicated.  Be eradicated.  Be eradicated.  Due to.  Eradicated.  Due to it's complete uselessness.  Due to.  It's.  Complete. 
[02:39:30]  Uselessness.  Uselessness.  To Sirius XM.  You should show that we're company men.  Company guys.  And I'm putting Sirius in capital letters and XM in small caps.  Hmm.  Nothing wrong with a little brown nosing.  A little ass kiss in there.  Sure.  Uselessness to Sirius.  Look at this.  And you shouldn't put.  Tiny X.  Tiny M.  Look.  Because you got taken over you dopes.  I wouldn't put.  Uselessness to Sirius XM radio.  I wouldn't.  By the way I wouldn't put content because this spam folder might pick that up. 
[02:40:00]  Oh.  I'm telling you.  Spam folders grab this.  A corporate spam folder will grab anything that seems even remotely fun.  Hmm.  All right.  Um.  Oh.  Wait.  Uh.  Okay.  All right.  I switched that.  That sucks.  Uh.  When Anthony.  When that bomb is fired with no compensation package.  We would like to also suggest that this position is.  Is to be eradicated.  No.  No.  This position be.  You don't need is to.  Yes.  This position be eradicated.  Be eradicated.  All right.  Don't hurt me.  I'm not.  Uh. 
[02:40:30]  This position be eradicated due to its complete uselessness to Sirius XM.  That's right.  Radio.  Yours respectfully.  Steve Carlesi.  That's right.  Ha ha ha.  Well how about.  Wait.  Um.  Respectfully yours.  Hmm.  Are we dumb?  Respect.  Fully yours.  Fully.  Steve.  Yours.  The gay queer producer.  Ha ha ha.  Steve.  The gay queer producer. 
[02:41:00]  Why?  Oh no.  Why?  I'm sorry.  I should have said producer.  Oh shit.  Oh no.  Do you have a water?  You do.  No.  Don't dump it on me.  You don't want to.  I have to go somewhere.  I like this stuff.  Because they have a gay channel over there.  So.  They do.  Ah.  We're showing that we're open to this type of program.  Homosexuality.  Steve.  The gay queer producer of the great Opie and Anthony show.  That's right.  Award winning.  Yes.  Oh yeah.  Okay.  What's the award they give out?  We don't have to prove it.  Award winning. 
[02:41:30]  Just say award winning.  Fuck it.  Radio show.  So.  Of the award winning will be an Anthony show.  An Anthony show.  We should demand a response immediately to our email.  No.  I wouldn't.  I think he'll get.  I think he'll see the seriousness of it.  A man of his stature knows.  He'll read that and go.  All right.  This has to be handled.  All right.  To Mel Karmazin.  CEO of Sirius XM.  Cost cutting.  I did switch that up for you, Jimmy.  We here at the Opie and Anthony program have figured out a fiscally responsible way to  get our meat hooks into more moolah. 
[02:42:00]  Whatever monies are currently being flushed down the turlet, also known as intern coordinator  salary, can be allocated toward on-air talent, specifically the Opie and Anthony program.  When that bum is fired with no compensation package.  We would like to also suggest that this position be eradicated due to its complete uselessness  to Sirius XM radio.  Respectfully yours, Steve, the gay queer producer of the award-winning Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:42:30]  I like it.  It's official.  It makes sense.  It shows the softest side of the program.  Yeah.  And this is how stupid we really are.  Push.  Send.  Why not?  That's not a nasty email.  It's simple.  You should send it.  He'll appreciate that.  Prove that I just sent it.  Mel will appreciate the fact that there are men who are willing to write emails and not  go through agents.  Yeah, right.  That's about that.  I guess that's the gig. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, whatever.  He might find the humor in it.  He might not.  Whatever.  I think he'll enjoy that.  Why wouldn't he?  Yeah.  Industrial result?  People are helping us out with a right size in the company.  Wow.  There's some smarties on the line.  Yeah, but they're boring.  You know, you send a quick one.  Keep it quick.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Greg on Long Island.  Greg.  You're going about this all wrong.  They're not interested in saving money.  They just hired Mike from Mike and the Mad Dog.  They got to find the money somewhere, my friend. 
[02:43:30]  They hired the Mad Dog.  We'll be there.  You should sign Poe's name to it, too.  By the way, they signed Chris, not Mike.  They didn't sign Mike, that boar.  Yeah, Mike's a douche.  Mike?  Hey, dog.  How you doing, dog?  Mike's a douche, and they didn't want him.  They wanted the excitement of the team, which was Mad Dog, who's a great guy, by the way.  I met him a couple times.  Are they really naming the whole channel after him?  I don't know what they're doing, but they just signed him to a big contract, and I think  he's going to do a great job.  He's a great guy, man. 
[02:44:00]  Great guy.  Huge Bruce Springsteen fan.  Seems like a better guy than that fucking boar, Francesa.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's very passionate for his radio show.  Wait, you don't think Francesa's going over there after, do you?  Hell fucking no.  No.  Meaning, you don't think this was a way to move Mike and the Mad Dog one at a time, because  maybe Francesa has a longer contract.  Usually the contracts run side by side.  Yeah.  Like Ebony and Ivory.  What?  All right.  If my buttons aren't set up, I would crash myself. 
[02:44:30]  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Scamming my nose is driving me nuts.  Listen.  We have Chris crying on his last show.  No way.  Oh, yeah, we do.  Actually, we have Mike and the Mad Dog's final show together.  You want to go through it a little bit?  We've got some clips.  I'd like to hear the crying.  I always found this show to be mildly interesting at best.  For the rest of the country, Mike and the Mad Dog, got to give it to them.  They were mediocre here in New York City. 
[02:45:00]  Definitely got to give that to them.  They did okay as far as sports radio goes.  They didn't have huge ratings.  They didn't have bad ratings.  They were just there, and the advertisers loved the show, and they were good at talking  about sports, although they don't know anything about hockey whatsoever.  Yeah.  They would always neglect hockey.  Yeah.  And they've been together 19 years, and Mad Dog ran to satellite radio, leaving Mike  behind.  He finally couldn't take that fucking fat jerk off anymore. 
[02:45:30]  He's like, enough with Francesca.  Yeah.  And then Mike went on the show, and he was told, because this is what corporate does,  you know, we don't want Mad Dog doing a final show.  No one gets to do a final show on radio.  But then I give Mike a little credit.  He actually had Mad Dog call into the show.  Oh, they wouldn't let him in?  No.  What?  Oh, no.  Babies, everybody is.  They wouldn't let him in.  And this is what blows my mind.  Obviously, they're pissed off that after 19 years, Mike and the Mad Dog are done, right? 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  But why not, like, for once go, wow, this Mike and the Mad Dog show made the company millions  and millions of dollars, so why don't we do the right thing and let them have a final  show?  It's not going to hurt the bottom line in the end.  And why don't you think about all the good the guy did for your company instead of right  away?  Oh, no, no.  Erase him from everyone's memory.  And wasn't fucking Mad Dog making less than Mike?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Probably.  I don't know.  I wonder why he's fucking annoyed.  Because Mike is pretty damn pompous.  And if they end up working together on satellite radio, I still say exactly what I'm saying. 
[02:46:30]  You got to hear what Mike said.  The end of this radio show is just like the Beatles.  What?  Breaking up.  Yeah.  That's why, I mean, the crying audio is great, but you got to hear, like, some of this other  stuff.  Mike and the Mad Dog, trouble you with me.  Yes, you can say it.  Good afternoon, everybody.  How are you today?  The Mike and the Mad Dog radio program.  Program?  That's how they start every show. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, it sounds great.  And this is Mike pushing the button, you know, doing the intro.  And, of course, that's Mad Dog doing that.  So, and then Mike comes on all somber because it's a sad day for the Mike and the Mad Dog  program.  You know, and for 19 years, a week short of 19 years, that is how...  That motherfucker has sat next to me.  Yeah.  For 19 years, I needed him to pump up my radio show. 
[02:47:30]  That is how we welcome New York to this program.  Every day, or most days, sometimes not in the summer, sometimes a rare day here or there.  But that was the sound that beckoned everybody that started the Mike and the Mad Dog program.  As you know, last night you learned that the Mike and the Mad Dog program will be no more.  As Dog has decided to move on. 
[02:48:00]  And the response has been, to me, overwhelming.  You know, we started this program on September 5th, 1989.  It was a shotgun wedding, as everyone may remember if you're old enough.  It was almost a quickie divorce.  We did not get along very well in the beginning.  The show was considered to be a colossal misjudgment the first couple of weeks.  Within nine months, it was the toast of the town.  And fortunately for Dog and myself, it has remained that for these many years. 
[02:48:30]  It has remained the show that has been at the top of the ratings, thankfully, for all those years.  Because of you.  And I know for many of you, and for me, and I know for Dog, this is a very sad occasion.  Is it?  Is it really Mike?  I'm so happy the dog moved on.  He saw some fucking real money at Sirius, and he was like, fuck this fatso.  He bugs me with the way he wears his headphones so they don't mess his hair up. 
[02:49:00]  He's irritating.  He really is.  Oh, I like these guys because he backed on us.  I like Francesca, too, for that.  These guys really backed on us.  I mean, he did the right thing from time to time.  But overall, you've got to look at his body of work.  He's a douche.  A douche.  Of the nozzle variety.  He is.  Here we go.  The history.  We get into the history of this show.  Over 19 years.  This will actually be really good for Mad Dog, by the way.  Because a lot of people in the press are saying, well, no one knows him on satellite radio. 
[02:49:30]  No one knew us on satellite radio.  We did quite well.  So you get a little history of the Mike of the Mad Dog show.  Because there are a lot of people out there going, who is this Chris Russo?  So I think we're helping him out today.  Over 19 years, we've experienced a lot here.  Not only are fights that were very public, and that is the part that seems to get accentuated.  But remember, five or six nasty squabbles in 19 years is not that many.  We've gone through marriages. 
[02:50:00]  We've gone through the birth of seven children.  We've gone through fucking in the ass.  How do they do that?  Sounds like you and I, Ant.  We've had about five or six fights.  I've been through...  No kids.  No kids.  Either one of you.  At least seven of your girlfriends.  I've been through some children.  You've been through a lot of children.  You're making your way around...  Seven girlfriends?  I thought that would get a pretty good laugh.  No?  All right.  What's this hurtful? 
[02:50:30]  It's funny.  It's hurt Ant's feelings.  Let's just hurt it.  Look at Sad Anthony.  Let's just hurt his...  Nice hand, dick.  Douche.  Asking of loved ones.  Mm-hmm.  We've gone through some very memorable days.  And with you, with us, all the while.  And thankfully, we were able to be here all those years and to become very much the fabric,  a part of the fabric of this great city and really part of the foundation. 
[02:51:00]  As someone who called me last night said, that you and Dog became the sports soundtrack  of everybody's lives in New York over the last...  Calm the fuck down.  Holy shit.  You were the only sports show for like 15 of those years.  Shut up.  I can name you six million women that don't know who you are, Fesso.  Right.  Of everybody's lives in New York over the last 20 years.  That Mike and the Mad Dog became a must-listen was something that was always appreciated. 
[02:51:30]  I don't think ever taken for granted.  And something that I think, you know, will remain a big part of our lives for as long  as we live.  I know, you know, anything else I do from here.  I'm 54 years old.  I've just agreed to stay here for five more years.  Oh.  Wow.  That's...  Motherfucker.  I bet you.  You got your money, didn't you, Mikey?  Yep.  No, no.  Oh, my God.  Let's talk about this for real. 
[02:52:00]  That's what happened.  They were in negotiations and Mikey got his money and Mad Dog didn't get his.  So Mad Dog said, fuck you.  I'm going to go get my money, Mikey.  Good for Mad Dog.  For once, I'm going to go get my money, Mike.  The fact that Mike wouldn't say we have to stay together.  Wow.  And make the same thing.  Yeah.  Wow, wow, wow.  After 19 years, they should be making the same money.  Just stay here for five more years, and I'm going to, after a quick vacation, put together  a new program that'll have some new elements. 
[02:52:30]  What?  I said I'd never have another partner, and I won't.  That's not the idea.  Because he never wanted...  No.  Let's really get into this, fucking asshole.  This guy never wanted a partner.  Nope.  If he spins this and goes, because no one could replace the partner I had...  That's what he's going to say.  I will stick two fingers down my throat and puke.  Uh-oh.  If you don't want to use your fingers, I guess I'm...  I said I'd never have another partner, and I won't.  That's not the idea.  The idea is for me to have some folks along who can, you know, offer some opinions, have 
[02:53:00]  some fun, offer some, uh...  Hold on.  Can you point out, what kind of fun are they going to have, asshole?  He cannot have fun.  He's incapable.  Are you going to have strippers in the studio?  Are you going to have big tits all...  What's going to be fun?  I'm a shock jock.  Talking to you.  He's describing interns right now.  Oh, I'm going to have interns around.  Some fun.  All right, who do you think's going to win a ball game?  Oh, it looks like the Mets, I think, because they got Santana.  That's fun.  What's fun?  That's the least amount of fun I've ever heard anyone having. 
[02:53:30]  And that includes the man who was on fire in the video I watched.  He had more fun.  Will you blow your fucking nose?  Hopi, I can't.  Please, just once.  Listen.  I know.  Listen, I'll do this for four hours.  Oh, fuck.  That's some snot you got piling up.  No, it's not.  It's blocking.  No?  Because of the swelling.  I have a little bit of liquid back there.  A little bit.  I have a little bit of mucus.  Mucus.  High school, I was voted, boy, most likely to have mucus leak onto his upper lip. 
[02:54:00]  All right, here we go.  I have some folks along who can offer some opinions, have some fun, offer some different perspectives  and some personality, and I'm looking forward to it.  We have not picked anybody.  We have not even remotely begun that process.  We have not even talked to anybody.  And might not for another week or two.  We're in no rush.  We're in no rush.  We'll put together a name. 
[02:54:30]  We'll put together some jingles, and we'll put together some people to join us on the  program.  Some jingles?  That's a fun part?  Of course.  Mike Princessa.  That's a little big.  Just like fucking Mike.  Hi.  We're going to have fun.  Whoop-dee-doo.  This is going to be a disaster for him, man.  Mike and his fat tits.  Mike and his wig hair.  Mike has no friends. 
[02:55:00]  What a tool.  Wouldn't it be funny if he actually just got a dog with rabies so he could still use Mike  and the mad dog, and it just sits there growling at him.  It just barked and shat all over the studio.  Foams at the mouth.  Say goodbye to those big numbers.  Mike and the cock hole.  Mike and the cock hole.  Or Mike.  Ah, whatever.  I stink.  And 19 years is a long time.  It's a long time to be part of a team.  Yeah. 
[02:55:30]  Not always easy being part of a team.  It isn't.  Maybe it should be.  Wasn't long enough, wasn't there?  Yeah, it wasn't long enough to demand equal pay.  For some friend.  Oh, this is funny.  Friends like that, who needs enemies?  Oh.  Watch it.  Language.  Not always easy being part of a team.  It isn't.  Maybe it should be.  I want him on our show.  And frankly, there were times I was not a good partner.  Many times.  Name them.  And I'm sure there were times when Dog probably felt the same way.  Oh, really?  You weren't a good partner?  Wow, that's not what we heard over the years.  Hey, I'm putting words in my mouth. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, shit.  Stop.  I appreciate it.  That's a pompous ass right there.  He's sort of admitting that he's a pain in the ass to work with.  But, and Mad Dog was, you know, he would say that he was a pain every once in a while.  Yeah.  If you've ever met Mad Dog, he's just happy all the time.  That's his fault.  He's happy at everything.  That's his burden.  That's his burden.  He's joy personified.  And I'm sure there were times when Dog probably felt the same way.  Wrong.  No.  I don't think for a second that we haven't loved every minute of this. 
[02:56:30]  Like I said, I understand today when I got up and I heard the folks talking about, you  know, us not being together anymore and how much it impacted him.  And I know people say it's a silly show, but I do understand that it has become part of  people's lives.  And that is the greatest testimony to it that anybody could ever give us.  Why did it happen?  Our relationship might be part of the reason.  Opportunities may be part of the reason.  Our contracts were coming to an end. 
[02:57:00]  The station's gone through a lot of upheaval in the last year, as everyone knows.  A lot of changes.  And a lot of opportunities present themselves.  I've had opportunities in the last year presented to me.  I know Dog's had opportunities presented to him.  I really wanted to stay.  I really want to finish and really wanted to finish my career here.  It was important to me.  I wanted to hopefully.  That's horseshit.  Oh, my God.  It's not important to you.  You go to the guy that's going to give you the most money in this business these days. 
[02:57:30]  There used to be a loyalty.  Very important.  There's nothing important about staying at the station anymore.  I have every pardon.  And you learn that lesson very early on.  Because they don't look at you that way whatsoever.  They'll replace you like that.  What do you think about Joe Beningo getting the spot?  You know, Joe, I think, is too good for Frances in the sense that he's too much of a strong personality.  But Beningo is a fucking passionate fan.  He's a huge Jet fan. 
[02:58:00]  Mike and Beningo.  Beningo is fucking good, man.  Didn't he start as a listener or something?  He was a listener from Saddle River.  He was Joe from Saddle River.  And he won a contest to get, like, your own show for a day or something.  Yeah.  And then he went to a Connecticut School of Broadcasting.  And I know everything about Beningo.  I should be shot.  Look at you.  But I think he's great.  Yeah.  And he became a fucking overnight guy.  I hate that he's not on overnights.  I used to ride around.  We were kicked off the air.  I couldn't listen to regular radio.  I'd listen to Art Bell and him.  What about that other dude?  Who? 
[02:58:30]  The Schmooze.  Oh, fuck him.  You don't like the Schmooze?  How can you?  What was his thing?  Steve's Schmoozing under the covers.  Are you?  Yeah, but, uh...  Smelling your own meat farts?  But he befriended Jerry Seinfeld.  He used to talk about that all the time.  Schmoozing.  And the New York Knickerbockers have lost another game.  The Nassau...  Why don't you just die?  The Nassau mausoleum.  It has gone worse.  The Nassau mausoleum.  Mausoleum.  Yeah.  And who would be behind the glass?  Eddie.  Eddie behind the glass.  Who knows?  He just... 
[02:59:00]  All I know is fucking...  Joe Benningo was great.  The Jets would lose.  Yeah.  And he was just a fan.  He's miserable when his teams lose.  Nice.  It was important to me.  I wanted to hopefully begin and end this career at this one station.  It's very important to me.  The dog decided to take a different avenue.  Nothing wrong with that.  Basically saying, and it wasn't important to dog.  Yeah.  What a jerk.  You would so leave the fan if someone offered you a lot more money. 
[02:59:30]  Nothing wrong with that.  The idea that we couldn't work together.  Hey, we've had our ups and downs and we haven't had a good last six months.  But you know what?  We've always been able to work together.  Haven't had a good last six months?  Six months, yeah.  That must have been a treat.  Yeah, no kidding.  Going in there.  Holy shit.  We might go a week to where we're like, ugh.  But six months.  What was the problem?  He does seem like a dick, right?  The talk on the street is he's just not a nice guy. 
[03:00:00]  Word on the street?  Word on the street.  S girl.  We're getting to the mad dog clip because then he calls in and starts crying.  I love it.  I love it.  I love it.  They took my time, Mikey.  When I came on after I went to Yankee Stadium that day, I said the show was at a crossroads.  I thought it was.  I did not know what was going to happen.  When Dog addressed the audience after the first stories were written, he did not know  what was going to happen. 
[03:00:30]  Decisions had not yet been made.  Everything came to a head at the same time.  Now, if you wonder, remember, stations deal on lead time.  They have to know what the future is going to hold.  Not three months from now.  They need to know what's going to happen six and nine and sometimes even a year out.  So they need answers sometimes that maybe you think should, hey, let everyone wait three  months or six months, but they don't feel they can.  They want to know what the future may hold.  Mike and the Mad Dog probably happens to you once in a lifetime, and it happens to very 
[03:01:00]  few people once in a lifetime.  Yeah, I can count two.  You and him, idiot.  Once in a lifetime?  Get a hold of yourself.  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  Happens once in a lifetime.  You know how many successful radio teams there have been?  This is a lifetime.  Guy's talking about like a fucking miracle.  A bit full of himself.  Wait till you hear the Beatles thing.  I hope we got that.  Few people once in a lifetime.  It is a very special gift, and it has been a very special gift. 
[03:01:30]  Now, I know that I've been left the best piece of sports real estate in this town.  Now, Drive Time on WFAN is the best piece of real estate in this city.  Dog made it that way.  I made it that way.  If I had left today with Dog, whoever would have taken over today would have walked into  a situation and would have received that same piece of real estate.  Now I have it.  With it comes opportunity, and with it comes some pressures to try to live up to what we 
[03:02:00]  created with Mike and the Mad Dog.  Won't be an easy task.  I'll try to do it.  I hope he paints his head red and puts on a Bjork song.  You're really bugging me, Mike.  Stop trying to wax poetic.  You spent 19 years.  You've made no difference.  Your whole job is to do this.  I don't think they're going to score this many points.  I don't think they're going to score that many.  What do you think?  We'll go to the phones and see what you think now.  How many points?  What you talked about for all those years was nonsense. 
[03:02:30]  Just stupidity.  Now, that said, I still like Russo a lot.  Well, now, this next clip, Mike goes against the corporation, and we'll have Mad Dog on  the phone.  Oh, man.  Yeah, man.  But first, we're going to take a quick break.  And then, because I thought it was important, I might have overstepped my bounds here with  the corporation, because, listen, corporations are ticklish, and they're sensitive.  And when a guy leaves, and he says goodbye, usually... 
[03:03:00]  Coochie Coo Corporation.  Coochie Coo.  Exactly.  Too bad you didn't fucking tickle the corporation into fucking...  I couldn't...  I had nothing.  Oh, boy.  I ran out of steam.  I was unraveling.  Boring myself.  Give Mad Dog some money.  Do we have that?  That's what I was going to say.  Yeah, exactly.  My grandmother had a cup, a cup to drink coffee out of it, and it said, if you tickle  my fancy, I'll tickle yours.  Oh.  She had it.  Did you ever tickle Granny's fancy?  Yes.  When I took the cup, you ever see Young Frankenstein, how they clank mugs and won breaks? 
[03:03:30]  I did that against her forehead.  Hey, do we have our new clip over here, or...  We only pay attention to CBS, right?  Yeah.  Why pay attention here over at XM?  All right.  I don't have the new clip for you today, Jimmy.  Maybe tomorrow.  A little clip.  And when a guy leaves, and he says goodbye, usually that's it.  But when we come back, Dog will be with us, and he will get a chance to address the audience  and say goodbye to you, because it should not be any other way.  We'll break and come back with Dog.  You're a rebel, man! 
[03:04:00]  Shouldn't be any other way.  And he does it before spots, and no one is going to turn the dial.  Yeah.  He just teased it.  He teased his partner leaving.  Shit.  To get some PPMs up.  The old PPM, the new way.  Well, here we go.  Mad Dog on the phone with Mike for the last time.  Listen, I think the two things that I need to address is that there's this lingering thought  that I'm leaving because of you and I not getting along. 
[03:04:30]  And that is not the reason.  I know you know that.  I called you a win tonight to tell you that again.  I know you know that.  And I think the audience is a little hesitant.  They think that maybe I'm leaving because you and I were fighting in the spring.  That's not it.  48.  It's time for a little change for me personally.  I think this will both do us a little good.  I think you'll do very well.  I can tell you a challenge.  Looking forward to it. 
[03:05:00]  You know, whatever I decide to do.  And I haven't yet quite.  I mean, listen, sooner or later you're going to find out what I'm going to do.  But I think that I just need a little challenge in my life, a little something different.  I just think that it was the right move at the right time.  They signed him without him knowing what he's going to do.  I got to put on a phone, man.  Not a lot to say where I'm going yet.  Maybe I guarantee you that that was one of the conditions of him coming on.  Maybe.  Don't.  Yeah.  This is a very, very tough call. 
[03:05:30]  This was not a decision that was made because, you know what?  I don't like FAN.  FAN's not treating me well.  Mike and me are fighting.  That's not it.  I just thought at this point in time, I just thought right now, it was time to try a little  something different.  Again, I think it would help the both of us in a lot of ways.  There was many a year that you and I were on.  We did a wonderful show. 
[03:06:00]  And I think that people thought the show had reached its peak.  I don't even believe that.  I think you and I did a good job in the spring, despite our problems.  I think that you and I, with the big moment, we're still as good as anybody.  Wow.  They're so taking the high road.  What happened in the spring?  Major problems.  There was something that happened in the spring.  Oh, yeah.  They're taking the high road, both these guys.  Did Francesca fucking rest his balls in Russo's mouth when he passed out, drunk, watching  kiddie porn?  What the fuck happened to these two?  This sounds like something huge went down in the spring.  In the spring, when I rubbed my shit dick all over his curtains, and he set my children 
[03:06:30]  on fire.  When I had sex with your wife, then I cut his rabbit's throat and put it in the soup, and  he took my kid on the amusement park.  What the fuck happened?  I don't know.  Something evil happened.  I bet it was something stupid, like fucking Russo used two of Francesca's creamers, and  then Francesca Hill hid the napkin holder.  And they just lost their minds at each other.  Where's the napkin holder, dog?  I don't know, Mikey.  Your mother's a cunt.  Dying. 
[03:07:00]  AIDS.  Puddle of AIDS reminds me that Mike and the Mad Dog did a bit, because you heard how  self-important Mike is being, right?  Puddle of AIDS reminds me that they once did a bit where they read the TV ratings of sporting  events, and this went on for 20 minutes.  I actually heard that.  You did?  I swear to God, and I kept it on, because I couldn't believe they were actually reading  TV ratings for sporting events. 
[03:07:30]  Well, that did an 11.2.  I thought it would be, I thought it would do an 11.3.  What do you think, Mikey?  Mikey, you gotta look at about the Super Bowl XI.  Let's go back to Super Bowl XI and see what the ratings were.  You were doing something important.  You were doing TV ratings.  I know.  Talk.  I actually know what they're doing, because the Mike and Mike are on ESPN Sports.  They're actually going to FAA.  They're all going to team up.  Just give me Mike and Mike and Mike.  Mike and Mike and Mike.  The Mike and Mike.  Enough about the Mikes.  Mike and Mike and Mike. 
[03:08:00]  They're going to have a bumper sticker.  Mike and the Mike and Mike.  But they're going to have a bumper sticker.  Mike to the third power.  Yeah.  Because they're going to try to be cool.  I hope we get the woman they call Mike in the hole.  People don't realize how long five and a half hours is.  I know Mike.  He knows me better than Mike knows Roe and better than I know Jeannie.  I mean, the bottom line.  I dream of Jeannie.  My favorite show.  Sorry.  I think they had sex with each other.  Yeah.  They are really. 
[03:08:30]  I know Jeannie.  I mean, the bottom line.  Mike knew me before I knew Roe.  Before I had three kids.  I knew Mike before I had four kids.  I knew my wife.  So.  Oh, here we go.  Here we go.  My favorite part.  Ew.  Pull the phone away.  It's nice.  Sounds like Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Sorry, Jimmy.  That was hurtful.  Chris.  You're blubbering. 
[03:09:00]  You're not Louis Pasteur discussing the process.  You guys spent the last 19 years discussing men who threw balls to each other.  It's meaningless.  Yeah.  Relax.  I hope for Russo's sake, that was all just an act.  He was acting and he was like naked at home, just like throwing money up in the air and  going to his wife.  Watch this.  Watch this.  I'll get him with the fake crying bit.  Stupid Alan Sniffen on the board.  Kudos for shut up.  Shut up. 
[03:09:30]  Kudos to Mike and the Mad Dog.  Do we have audio of what Alan Sniffen did with this whole thing?  I imagine, you know, just...  On board reflection.  What a stupid move.  Bad for F-A-N.  Who's going to know him on satellite radio?  Oh, I hope he gets...  Shut up.  It's like I said before, satellite radio just isn't taking off.  Let me tell you something about Alan Sniffen.  I almost hope Mel offers him a satellite radio show.  Yeah.  And then hires him.  Yeah.  And then he makes it name him, I'm a dentist and a cunt. 
[03:10:00]  And he has to just talk about being a dentist.  And a cunt.  Yes.  But he smells it with a K, so it's not offensive on the packaging.  On the packaging.  Here's how his show starts.  Goddamn rich cunt.  Board reflection.  Because that's how I am when I hear them.  A little longer.  Let's hear him. 
[03:10:30]  It wasn't an easy call.  I'm going to miss that show.  I wanted to stay away.  I didn't listen this morning.  I didn't think it was the...  I couldn't listen to the calls this morning.  I didn't want to listen.  Big schnozzle.  One guy today said, because I'm going to break the mood here.  Oh, you got to break the mood because you don't have a fucking emotion in your body. 
[03:11:00]  Why did he interfere with him?  Why didn't he let him continue?  Why would you want to break the mood, you fucking fat dope?  Let me break the mood.  A dog is making a spectacle of himself.  The same way you break escalators.  People's feet would just step on him.  Fucking fatso.  Wait till you hear how he breaks the mood, by the way.  You're going to be amazed at this pompous ass.  Taking the moment away from Mr. Mad Dog there. 
[03:11:30]  We got to go back to the blubbering, though.  Yeah.  Sounds like he's deciding if he should have a limb removed or try a radiation treatment.  Yeah.  Dude, fucking John or something.  John Walsh wasn't this depressed at 81 when he was doing interviews.  Oh, shit.  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  He has some more blubbering dogs.  Sounds like he had to make a tough decision and pull the plug on a family member or something.  Exactly.  This is not euthanizing someone.  You're making $15 million or whatever you're making. 
[03:12:00]  Good for you.  Hey, he's doing about $3 million a year over the next, ow, five years.  Damn, I broke my finger.  Wait, wait, you know.  God, is he sucking snot.  This is going to take a while, but the boys out there are jumping on board.  Boomer from Jersey.  He wasn't crying.  He was doing lines of coke off a hooker's ass. 
[03:12:30]  All right.  Now we go back.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  It wasn't an easy call.  I'm going to miss that show.  I wanted to stay.  I didn't listen this morning.  I didn't think he was here. 
[03:13:00]  I couldn't listen to the calls this morning.  I didn't want to listen.  He listens.  Mr. Dog, one guy today said, because I'm going to break the mood here, because you're going  to make me cry, and I'm never going to forgive you.  But one guy said today that we would like the breakup of the Beatles, Eddie told me when  we walked in.  But Eddie said, be comfortable, Chris.  Hopefully, Leonard and Harrison.  This mic doesn't have a clue. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, he's a dope.  This is a moment, and you have to, like, open your fat face.  Shut up.  Did you hear him going, because, you know, you're going to get me starting to cry.  Boy, he sounded on the verge of breaking up there, didn't he?  He sure did, Anthony.  He sure did.  Going to get me crying, and I'll never forgive you.  You.  One guy today said, because I'm going to break the mood here, because you're going to make  me cry, and I'm never going to forgive you. 
[03:14:00]  But one guy said today that we would like the breakup of the Beatles, Eddie told me when  we walked in.  But Eddie said, be comfortable, because the guy said you were John.  And I said, oh, good, as long as Dog was Ringo.  They should have broke up 15 years ago.  Even in his analogy, he has to say he's Lennon.  What a dick.  Anyone knows Lennon was the great Beatle.  Exactly.  Here, sign this, Mike. 
[03:14:30]  Could you sign this record, please?  Oh, Brian from St. Louis.  Mike in the sad dome.  That's good.  That was awful on that one.  That was uncomfortable.  What a shitty reaction.  He acts like the guy just fucking told Woody Allen's a moose bit.  How funny was that joke? 
[03:15:00]  I got to hear that.  It was so dumb.  It wasn't that good of a joke.  It was just awful.  Oh, God almighty.  I want to make like a tree and leaf.  Kudos.  All right, hold on a minute.  I just got to.  All right, here we go.  He said, because I'm going to break the mood here, because you're going to make me cry,  and I'm never going to forgive you.  But one guy said today that we were like the breakup of the Beatles, Eddie told me when 
[03:15:30]  we walked in.  But Eddie said, be comfortable, because the guy said you were John.  And I said, oh, good, as long as dog was Ringo.  Yeah.  Oh!  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Boo!  He stinks, and I don't like him.  Oh, my God.  We're almost done here.  It's a joke, son.  Don't you get it? 
[03:16:00]  I made a funny son, and you're not laughing.  That's funny.  I'm funny.  Yuck.  Does anybody remember Lasker?  He had like a puppet laugh.  That was fucking terrible.  I would never try to make him laugh, ever.  No.  He was laughing, because he's like, oh, now I know why I'm leaving. 
[03:16:30]  I don't have to deal with that dope anymore.  You make me cry, I'll never forgive you.  Yeah.  Really?  You wouldn't?  You're going to make me cry, and I'll never forgive you.  Fucking dope.  You didn't even see what your partner was doing.  You just signed on for five years.  Sign, sign, sign, sign, sign, sign, sign, sign, sign, sign, sign, sign, sign, sign, sign, sign, sign, sign.  Have you talked to the dog to see what he's going to do?  No.  Just give me the pen.  Sign, sign, sign here, sign here, sign here, page eight, sign here, sign here, copy, paste, copy, paste.  Yeah, dog, you're going to miss me. 
[03:17:00]  You don't even know it.  I'm going to miss you.  I'm going to miss dog.  I'm going to be a month from now.  I'm going to be saying, boy, you know what I'm going to say to my wife?  I really miss dog.  And she's going to say, get out of the house.  Did he say, what are you, nuts?  Get out of here.  Exactly right.  These two are exactly right.  They should do their breakup show every day.  Oh, yeah.  Listen to this.  I've never heard two people who were less funny together.  Oh, God.  I've never heard.  Hitler and Stalin.  Had bigger laughs going back and forth in the fucking meetings they had. 
[03:17:30]  The guy on fire had a funnier exchange with the other guy trying to throw the blanket  on him.  This exchange stinks.  Ah, cool.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  What?  Did he say, what are you, nuts?  Get out of here.  Exactly right.  You know, I felt very bad.  And then he just, ah, you know.  It's still real to me, damn it.  Ah, boy. 
[03:18:00]  Let's get out of here.  Exactly right.  You know, I felt very bad here in the last three or four months with all this speculation.  I probably, maybe I could have handled it a little differently.  You know, I think that the thing that you and I had more than anything else, we had passion  for sports.  You know, I love sports.  You love sports.  Missed the big game.  I'm going to miss that.  You did this with your eyes open.  You know what you're getting into.  I think you'll have a lot of fun.  I don't think there's any question.  You know what?  You will have a great time doing what you do.  You know that you did this. 
[03:18:30]  And I can never, never pay you back for these 19 years.  It's been that good.  Uh, it's something that I could never even have dreamed of having 19 years like this.  18 and a half.  Remember you hate each other for six months?  Yeah.  Oh, where's the 10th clip?  Oh.  The big goodbye clip we don't have.  Oh, boy.  Adios.  Oh, E-Rock!  Oh, no.  No, it's not E-Rock, is it? 
[03:19:00]  Here he comes.  Oh, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.  You dumb asshole!  We just spent an hour to get to the point where he actually says goodbye for the last time,  and I don't have the clip there, E, to the line.  All right.  Give me one second.  You'll have it.  Sorry.  I thought it was on there.  You thought it was on there?  You thought it was on there?  All right.  That makes everything better.  All right.  He's sorry.  He thought it was on there.  Wait, can we ask Steve?  Come in for a second.  God, here's your prof. 
[03:19:30]  And just FYI, Sniffin didn't do a board reflection about it yet, but this is what he had to say  about it.  He said he's not sure if SiriusXM should be spending big bucks on anybody, but he felt  that if they were going to hire somebody, they should have went after Mike Francesca instead.  Oh, really?  Oh, brother.  Francesca?  Yeah.  Francesca.  Francesca.  Francesca.  Mike Fresca.  Steve?  Yeah.  Sorry.  What did you want?  The last clip.  Yeah, where was it?  I thought E-Rock cut it up for you. 
[03:20:00]  Did he not?  No.  If you were listening to the show, you would know.  No, I know.  I know.  I was listening.  Yes.  I know.  I know E-Rock's getting it right now.  Yes.  What did E-Rock say, if you were listening?  He said, I thought it was on there.  I'll go get it right now.  I love the Gene Wilder clip, by the way.  Oh, I know.  You dumb asshole.  That is my favorite clip.  That is a good one.  All right.  What do you think of Mike and the Mad Dog breaking up? 
[03:20:30]  I think it's tragic, really.  That's it.  Why?  You don't even know sports.  I don't know sports.  And quite frankly, I could give a shit, but you know, I had to say something.  I had to say something.  I'm kind of nervous I sent that email.  Really?  Why?  Yeah, there was a lot of energy when we started the show, and now I'm like, why did we send  that awful email?  Was it awful?  It was silly.  Nothing hateful about it.  Hey, Jimmy, I heard back from that lawyer, by the way.  What?  The one you asked me to get on the phone before.  Want to talk to him today or tomorrow?  Tomorrow I think.  Okay.  Thank you.  Can we get the fucking clip? 
[03:21:00]  You dumb asshole!  That is a good one.  Boy, is that a fucking gem.  Crystal clear quality.  Oh, yeah.  So, uh, where's the clip?  I'll go fetch it from you, Rob.  All right.  Don't worry.  It's not like the new bosses are listening right at this moment.  Well, we just emailed them.  They're probably reading emails.  That's true.  It's not like they're spending their time listening to our show at this point with 42 days left 
[03:21:30]  in our country.  Aren't you glad I talked to you out of cause counting?  Yeah.  I gotta ask you something.  Why would that clip not be there?  Was it an error in the burning process?  Or did he just not put the actual time he says goodbye on the disc?  That's a really good question.  I wish somebody would just address Eric.  I really want to know.  Hey, hey, hey!  Eastside!  Eastside does a great mad dog. 
[03:22:00]  We'll do filler.  Eastside!  Do you think Gene Wilder would have anything to say to Eric?  Uh, yeah.  You dumb asshole!  I love that one.  There we go.  Eastside, do your mad dog.  I hear you do a great mad dog.  We're playing the audio of their last show together.  Thank you, Ron.  Hold on a minute.  Fuck Ron.  Hold on.  Yes.  Ron Fez, noon to three. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah.  And get off the noon, everybody!  Howdy today, Mike and the Mad Dog Radio Program on August 19th, 2008.  Talking to you about the world of sports.  Michael, how are you?  I'm fine, dog.  That's it right there.  Oh, yeah, both of them.  That's it right there.  My specialty as a mad dog is Francesa.  Are you doing Francesa?  Yes.  Because all he does is reverse the subject and predicate and sentences  and then pretends that what he said the second time is somehow profound. 
[03:23:00]  Like, Eli Manning needs to improve his quarterbacking skills.  His quarterbacking skills, Eli Manning needs to improve.  That's it.  That's good stuff right there.  Ron Fez, noon to three.  All right, thanks.  Got pulled in there a little late.  All right, thank you.  Thanks for the party the other day.  Oh, cool.  You like to...  It was fun to hang out with Jim and everybody.  You like the big pool party there, Eastside Dave.  Yeah.  Got to hang out with every one of my friends and heroes from radio.  A little drinking. 
[03:23:30]  Did Gene Wilder like Dave's impression?  You know, I'm not sure.  Why don't we ask him?  You dumb asshole.  No.  I just got off the bus.  I'm very...  It's high outside.  You got a little Gene Wilder to you these days.  Do I?  A little bit.  Oh, I see you shaved.  So we're not beer buddies anymore?  Nope.  You take a bus here?  Yeah.  I take a bus from the...  Holy shit.  All the way down from the Jersey Shore just to get up here.  No, no joke.  Tell these guys how long you're on a bus every day. 
[03:24:00]  Hour 10 minutes.  The entire commute's hour 40.  Hour 40.  Each way.  Each way.  Where do you live?  You're on a bus for three hours a day.  Yeah.  More.  More than that.  20 minutes for the mathematicians out there.  Right.  And then there's the subway, Mr. Opie.  And then there's the driving to the bus.  Sure.  Where do you live?  Oh.  I live down by the Jersey Shore now, Jim.  We're a place near Howell.  Why?  It's too far.  I don't know.  What are you doing?  I wasn't thinking properly.  A child came into my life and she slowly made me bankrupt. 
[03:24:30]  A little fucking...  Oh, you saved money.  Yeah.  I thought I was going to save money and then I realized that's not happening either.  Yeah.  Because you're spending a lot of money on the commute.  Yeah.  I forgot about little details.  Right.  Wow.  I'm not reliable.  Yeah.  Well, that's what happens when you have substance abuse problems.  You forget about the small things.  And I'm like, wow.  More money's leaving the house than Ben's coming in.  Oh, you got that going on.  Yeah. 
[03:25:00]  So, you know, if you ever want to throw an extra hundred or so, I'm open for anything.  What do we got today?  Thank you.  Who do you ask for a raise, Opie?  I did.  Don Wicklin gave me $70 a month last time we were up for raises.  $70 a month?  That's right.  Jesus Christ.  Dave, I could give you $9 today.  All right.  Thank you, Opie.  $9.  Thank you, Opie.  We're on a Fez Noon to three.  All right.  There's your $9.  I won't be giving you anything. 
[03:25:30]  Sorry.  Thank you very much.  All right.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  Goodbye.  Now, that was called filler.  And we still don't have the clip.  You want to take a break?  Where's E-Rock?  Can we have a camera real quick?  Yeah.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  That's not me, by the way.  I'm a good man when my phone goes off at somebody else's.  Not me.  E-Rock.  What happened?  I don't know what's going on.  I was doing something else.  You dumb asshole. 
[03:26:00]  Don't roll your eyes.  You fucked this up.  No.  The 10th track had a problem burning.  Steve's burning right now.  It's almost done.  I mean, I know you're busy, but how come it didn't get burned before the other stuff came  in?  Yeah.  Because I thought it was.  I thought all 10 tracks were on.  I wish you were burning like that guy that would put on the video.  So now what?  Right there.  You guys do realize the new bosses are listening and taking notes, right?  You dumb asshole. 
[03:26:30]  I hope.  Here's track 10.  I so hope it doesn't work.  Oh, please don't worry.  I hope he burned his data.  And here's, well, because timing's everything.  And here's the last clip where they say goodbye to each other.  This is it.  The last time they talked on a radio show together.  When I was in this, I was with a friend of mine in the city and I was not married and  everything, obviously.  And I got a call from Mason saying, listen, this is what we're going to do.  You talked about this before, too.  We're going to put you with Mike, the two of you. 
[03:27:00]  And I said, geez, they're going to put me with a partner here.  I haven't worked with a partner in my life.  Mike, Mike doesn't know me.  Boy, Mike and I, I mean, Mike's dominating.  How am I going to do this?  Mike does.  I'm a nutcase.  How's he going to deal with that?  And if you would have told me then, except, you know, August of 89, that I'd be sitting  here August of 08, still doing a talk show and having this much success, I would have  thought you crazy.  And so I heard you say the same thing.  I would not be in this situation. 
[03:27:30]  It wasn't for you.  You would not have been in this situation that it wasn't for me.  And we all ought to the fans.  Bottom line, we ought to the fans.  Absolutely.  Knock him dead.  I'll speak to you soon.  Dog be well.  You dumb asshole.  That was the most unemotional ending I've ever heard.  Dog be well.  Knock him dead.  See you soon.  Dog be well.  Dog be well.  Take care, fatso.  Beat it, lisp.  That's what they should have just said to each other.  Hey, get a lot of fatso over there.  All right.  It's the Mike and Impediment show. 
[03:28:00]  We just filled for 15 minutes to get that on the air?  Yeah, that was it.  All right.  Well, why didn't Iraq tell us that it wasn't really worth playing?  Iraq didn't know what was going on.  And we're going to take a break.  Jimmy is going to maybe blow his nose.  I can't.  I can't.  You don't understand what's happening, Gregory.  My mustache hairs.  Hold on.  I'm not Greg.  I know you're not.  But it just sounds more efficient.  That's why the two G's at the end.  Yeah.  Here's what I'm going to do with my mustache, by the way.  I've decided I'm going to grow it very, very long. 
[03:28:30]  And then I'm going to comb it up over my face and part it with bobby pins.  So I look through a hair curtain at all times.  Boo.  Boo.  LOL.  Ugh.  I hate when people write IMHO on message boards.  Oh, in my humble opinion.  Oh, fucking stinks.  In my humble opinion.  Shut up.  Do you abbreviate in real life like that?  Fucking asshole. 
[03:29:00]  And it's never a humble opinion.  No, it's not.  There's some overblown, pompous bullshit.  Some fatso.  It's just your opinion.  Exactly.  What's humble about it?  If you were humble, you wouldn't write it.  Yeah.  You'd think it.  Yeah, exactly.  Fucking cunt.  Shut up.  It's not a humble opinion.  What's humble about it?  We're back.  But Kane's wife still has that cast. 
[03:29:30]  That's a handshaking injury or something?  A handshaking injury.  I heard something when we were on break that she, like, has a handshaking injury.  What'd she shake with?  Michael J. Fox?  She's licking with damage.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Actually, I got the audio of that.  It's an old story, but...  And then they warn people that you can hurt your hands shaking hands.  What?  Is there a war going on? 
[03:30:00]  Have you ever?  The fucking Chinese are coming.  Some politicians say it's an injury waiting to happen, and it happens...  Who says that?  Who says that?  I've never heard that.  Who says that?  Fucking Yitzhak Rabin?  Boo!  Boo!  You dumb assholes!  Let's get it.  See, that was going to say, I'm worse than not.  Other people have been killed. 
[03:30:30]  Some politicians say it's an injury waiting to happen.  What?  A bullet to the head?  What made you think when my dead guy went bombed that that was a great subject?  Because I swung twice and missed, because you know why?  I got to admit something.  I never heard your line.  And I'm quick to push the buttons, though.  I never heard your line.  It was about a guy getting shot.  I get it now. 
[03:31:00]  Oh, Jesus.  I swear to God, I just knew it bombed, and I ran right from my machine, and the beauty  of it, I tried the same fucking thing.  All right, let's try again.  Some politicians say it's an injury waiting to happen.  Robert Kennedy?  Fuck.  All right.  It's silly time.  We need a sweeper.  All right, find a black guy.  What?  We need a sweeper while we go into silly time. 
[03:31:30]  Steve!  Get Steve in his notepad.  Make him improv.  Let's get him improv.  Make him do a little improv.  Silly time sweeper?  Silly time sweeper.  So, like, we're kind of getting a little silly.  So, I want to be able to acknowledge that, and all of a sudden, we hit the silly time sweeper.  I'll go there.  You got a concept for the silly time sweeper yet?  In the last 30 seconds? 
[03:32:00]  No.  Yeah.  But, um...  Oh!  Excuse me!  No, you're welcome.  I'll just step aside.  Silly time sweeper.  Well, we can take...  What's your first vision of the silly time sweeper?  A silly time sweeper, I think, has a lot of non-sequitur drops that don't make any sense of where you guys are screaming and cursing.  And, um...  Saying things that really don't go together.  And, uh...  With carnival music.  And, uh...  Followed by some kind of explosion.  And, uh... 
[03:32:30]  And then a big booming voice at the end says,  It's silly time.  Hmm.  What about, like, uh...  Some Laurel and Hardy, aren't I?  All right.  No?  What do you got, Davey?  Yes, I agree.  I have a great...  I have the perfect bed for this.  Perfect bed for a silly time sweeper?  All right.  We're trying out a, uh...  Music bed for the silly time sweeper.  It's really fucking weird right now.  Steve, say something silly.  Um...  I'm straight.  Yeah. 
[03:33:00]  I said silly.  I can't believe I've been doing this shit for ten years and have not blown my brains out.  How about that?  Ooh, show your head.  All right, here it says...  Yes, I love Bjork.  Bjork.  Uh, here we go.  Here's the music we want to use for the silly time sweeper, according to Danny.  That's it.  That's the silly Danny music.  All right.  That's pretty fucking...  That's pretty good.  Work off that, Steve.  We want something by tomorrow.  That's silly.  We got the big bosses listening right now. 
[03:33:30]  That is a silly song.  They're taking in all this goodness and deciding what they want to do with this show.  I'm not a rapist, but to do it to this song would be just great.  Holy shit.  Or just a horrific murder.  Yeah.  Oh, good.  Could someone get this...  Put it behind the beheading video?  Oh, that's horrid.  Or the guy on fire?  Or the guy on fire would be good.  Man fights to keep private heavy swingers club open. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah, he's a big fat guy.  What, the water's getting involved and they don't like the fact that only heavy people could  do this swinging at this particular club?  No, I think it's in his backyard.  Oh, that's the problem.  There's kids around.  Bunch of naked fat pigs trying to fuck each other.  Oh, God.  They want to declare it a pig farm.  People want to...  Well, Mongo is suggesting that the listeners create the silly sweeper.  We haven't had audience participation in a while.  You do one.  And let's see if yours is better than what the listeners come up with, Steve. 
[03:34:30]  Of course it will be.  And if it's not, you get fired and the listener gets your job.  I don't agree with that.  But I can almost guarantee you that what I come up with is going to be better than what  people come up with.  By the way, people are saying if you do kill yourself, please do it live on the air.  No, I will not give them that satisfaction.  And Danny's going to play the part of the listener.  That's actually really good.  And Danny wrote that.  He wants to be the listener because if his is better, then you're out the door and he 
[03:35:00]  gets your job.  That's why that was really funny.  I'm sure that's what he wants, too.  Yeah, that's why it's really funny because there is some realism to it.  All right.  Back to McCain's wife getting injured because she shook a hand.  Some politicians say it's an injury waiting to happen.  And it happened to Cindy McCain Wednesday when one supporter took things a little too  far.  I'm absolutely fine.  Just we had a great lunch and fundraiser and I shook hands and it was still a very enthusiastic 
[03:35:30]  supporter.  Mrs. McCain had surgery for a wrist injury several years ago.  Wednesday's firm handshake aggravated the injury and left her in his leg.  All right.  He doesn't make cumsies easy.  He's got to jerk him off for a long time.  Where's Sam?  This is a bleep game waiting to happen.  You can make this sound like it's a good pink sock injury.  Oof.  While some believe good handshaking could be considered an art form, experts say the action  should be taken seriously because injuries on the campaign trail are actually quite common. 
[03:36:00]  So much so that the American Occupational Therapy Association devoted a whole campaign to  helping people stay safe while meeting and greeting on the trail.  Keeping your elbow at a 90 degree angle is actually optimal.  Protecting the shoulder and back by not reaching forward and over things and into crowds.  Sam, you better make it here.  And there's a couple of places where you're not going to think you're going to want to 
[03:36:30]  put a beep, but you got to put the beep there.  Yeah.  If you know what I mean.  The beep game.  I don't even know what she said at the end of the clip.  Now we just got to play it with beeps.  All right.  Beeps.  We could do line of the day, but also we have Norm MacDonald said on the Saget roast that  people are saying it's one of the most brilliant things ever done on TV, Jimmy.  It was great.  Or at least one guy said it on instant feedback.  One guy.  I heard he was, you know, doing a, um, kind of a, a, a character almost mocking the very 
[03:37:00]  institution of the roast and Jimmy thought, and, and, and parodying it.  Jimmy thought it was brilliant.  I thought it was great.  Jimmy.  Poor Jimmy.  Can't.  He can't breathe.  Jimmy.  Yes.  It's sleepy time.  So tired.  I can't breathe.  He goes.  Ouch.  Here's Norm MacDonald.  Well, John has a reputation for being a bit of a swinger.  Did you know instead of an umbilical cord, John was born with a bungee cord? 
[03:37:30]  And Cloris Leachman is here.  Cloris?  Cloris, if people say you're over the hill, don't believe them.  Why, you'll never be over the hill.  Not in the car you drive.  Greg Giraldo is here.  He has the grace of a swan, the wisdom of an owl, and the eye of an eagle. 
[03:38:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, this man is for the birds.  Oh, God, they're awful.  Susie Essman, of course, is famous for being a vegetarian.  Hey, she may be a vegetarian, but she's still full of baloney in my book.  In my book, I...  Gilbert Godfrey, one of my best friends.  I love Gilbert.  When you go to the men's room later, you'll see a sign that says, 
[03:38:30]  Gentlemen, pay no heed, go right in.  There's no room that says Scoundrel on it.  Scoundrel?  Oh, God, it's this, like, scoundrel.  And then he gets to, uh...  Who were you guys roasting again?  I forgot.  Bob, you have a lot of well-wishers here tonight,  and a lot of them would like to throw you down one.  A well. 
[03:39:00]  They want to murder you in a well.  Seems a little harsh, but...  Apparently, they want to murder you in a well.  It says here on this card.  Now, but Bob has a beautiful face, like a flower.  Yeah, cauliflower.  No offense, but...  Your face looks...  Like a cauliflower. 
[03:39:30]  Now, I heard you have hair in your chest, Bob, and, uh...  Well, let me tell you something.  That isn't your only resemblance to Rin Tin Tin.  Rin Tin Tin?  Your dog face.  How can you not get that?  No, there are times when Bob has something on his mind. 
[03:40:00]  When he wears a hat.  With no thoughts at all.  Just a hat.  And Bob isn't the biggest sports fan.  I don't think I'm telling any tales out of school.  I took him to a...  I took him to a ball game, and he came toting a double-barreled shotgun.  You remember that? 
[03:40:30]  I said, what the H is that for?  Bob said, I heard the Lions were playing the Tigers.  You remember that?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  It's horrific.  No, he's a good guy.  He's a good guy.  He's never bought Christmas seals.  He told me he wouldn't know what to feed them.  Christmas seals?  This concludes...  Well, that's not the best one.  The Joker... 
[03:41:00]  Oh.  What happened?  The line that made me laugh the hardest.  He goes, oh, well, you know, Bob.  He's the same stinker he's always been.  He's a stinker.  He called Bob a stinker.  That act was, like, right out of 1960, like, five.  You know what's weird?  I have a rod.  Oh.  You got...  Holy fuck, that is really funny.  What a goose.  The next instance of feedback?  Okay, sorry.  I'm a don't-get-the-bit guy.  Yeah, it's one of those things. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah.  Either I think it's hilarious or it sucks.  Just tap.  Are we going to make it to the end here?  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Sponsored by Carbonite.com.  Carbonite backs up your computer hard drive,  so you never have to worry about losing any of your files.  But we're getting the bleep game together.  I want to try to play before we get out of here.  Check it out at Carbonite.com.  Promo code XM.  Here is a runner-up line of the day. 
[03:42:00]  She does look good.  How about a face shot there?  Doesn't matter what her face is.  No, I mean you.  How about a face shot on me?  Anything?  Don't need to ask.  Just...  Don't need to ask.  Just go tie my shoe and pretend you're yawning.  It'll happen.  It'll happen.  Ah, that was funny.  Do we have to worry about Tropical Storm Fae?  Oh, no.  All right, good.  Runner-up line of the day.  Another one.  What is your username and password on the adult diaper site?  Oh, my God. 
[03:42:30]  Loves adult babies.  Password.  Um...  Nothing.  Oh, I hate him on the radio.  Steve.  Very good.  Steve's stinking up the joint.  Yep.  Another runner-up line of the day.  Yeah, I've done it.  I got a few pictures of my hog.  Oh, do you?  Yeah, of course.  Yes.  Could I see those, please?  We're getting a lot of...  We found that they're delicious. 
[03:43:00]  Steve got a little bit of a beating today.  All right, we'll do it tomorrow.  Here is your line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  This fan sent me a link to a video site. 
[03:43:30]  He goes, it's the worst site on the net.  And I don't remember the name of it.  I'm trying to find it.  Foundry music.  I don't know what's going on.  I was doing something else.  Oof.  Steve's got a beating.  You're right.  Yeah.  Earl.  Earl.  Hello.  Hello.  Look at Earl just kind of...  Saunters in.  Earl.  What do you think of the Mike and the Mad Dog thing?  Weird. 
[03:44:00]  First thought in my head is weird.  Yeah.  Why is it weird?  Just thought it was one of those things that you wouldn't...  Never see in.  By the way, Ryan and Fezzman in the 3.  Too late.  I was supposed to say that first.  So you're a little broken up about it.  A little busted up about it.  Yes.  He's sleeping.  Jimmy is taking a little nap. 
[03:44:30]  He's very tired.  He's breathing into the microphone.  Very loudly.  Jimmy, you're sleeping.  Jimmy, you're sleeping.  Jimmy, Jimmy, what are you doing?  Relaxing.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Yes.  What are you doing?  Relaxing.  What are you dreaming about? 
[03:45:00]  Tell us your dreams.  Two guys dying.  I think I did those for a second, though.  You did.  You definitely did.  Jimmy.  Yes.  Yes.  We'll do the bleep game with that. 
[03:45:30]  We'll do the bleep game with that.  Yes.  Handshaking thing tomorrow.  See you guys.  Bye.  Bye.  Ugh.  Yep.  Mm-hmm. 
[03:46:00]  Yep.  What happened?  What?  What are you talking about?  He just didn't do it.  What's he doing in there?  What is he doing?  Y-Rock, what are you doing?  You didn't signal me.  You just said goodbye.  That's usually the signal.  No, it's this.  Holy Jesus Christ.  I really believe we could get a monkey to do some of these jobs around here.  Better.  If you have to wait for a signal when it's so obvious that was the out. 
[03:46:30]  Holy shit.  What?  God damn you.  Y-Rock, what are you doing?  What's wrong with you?  You usually say goodbye, and then you go on for a little while, and then you wait and  wave to me to go.  You dumb asshole.  What do you have to say about that clip?  That's your new clip.  Does it make you happy or sad?  On the air, please.  Ask him where he thought it was from.  Oh, yeah.  Where did you think that clip was from, Y-Rock? 
[03:47:00]  I said, I don't know.  It's probably from, oh, crap.  Charlie, no, Willy Wonka.  The listener called, he said, where is it from?  He said, probably Willy Wonka.  Willy Wonka would say this.  You dumb asshole.  He was talking to his kids in that movie.  That's what he caught Charlie and Grandpa with the fizzy lifting drink.  He's asked.  You dumb asshole, and I have to clean this fucking tube.  It was a kid's movie.  A bit dark, sure, but it was a kid's movie. 
[03:47:30]  I'm not going to be calling the kids an asshole.  Yeah.  Charlie's a dumb asshole.  Would you like the new clip, Y-Rock?  It's just for you.  You dumb asshole.  It's when Charlie gave the gobstopper back at the end.  When he sold it to Slugworth.  Yeah.  Why do I find this funny?  I'm going to leave.  All right.  Well, we're going to.  I guess we have to. 
[03:48:00]  Handle the out.  Well, as long as we point to him, you know.  Yeah.  Hands going up in the air, and there goes the point.  And there goes the point. </pre>
