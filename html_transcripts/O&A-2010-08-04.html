<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show, with Opie absent due to illness, opened with Anthony Cumia and Robert Kelly discussing Kelly's appearance on the Joy Behar show, his subsequent aggressive Twitter blocking ("blocking Gestapo"), and his experiences (graphic details provided) at massage parlors, including a humorous back injury.  The conversation delved into the differences between past and present methods of audience feedback (letters vs. immediate online comments),  featured a detailed, graphic description of a pornographic video, and included anecdotes about Kelly's childhood and the death of a friend.  They also discussed various television shows and movies, including *Space 1999*, *Doctor Who*, *Barbarella*, and *Seinfeld*, criticizing their portrayals of the future.  Kelly promoted his upcoming stand-up shows and mentioned Buzz Barton's karaoke.  The segment was punctuated by highly vulgar and sexually explicit language.

The show continued with a discussion about jailbreaking iPhones, featuring guests Sam Roberts and Travis, and later Jimmy Norton.  They discussed the process, risks (voiding warranties), and benefits, including custom interfaces and using different cell service providers.  Tangents included discussions of "Friendly Bob" elevator encounters, Joe DeRosa's phone, and Robert's acting roles in *Louie* and *Curb Your Enthusiasm*.  The conversation frequently veered into explicit discussions of oral sex, fueled by listener calls and interspersed with clips of poorly singing American Idol contestants.

A rambling conversation followed, featuring guests Jimmy Norton, Otto, and Robert Kelly.  This segment included graphic descriptions of sexual acts, discussions of a jailbroken iPhone, prostitution, massage parlors, and perceived inadequacies of women's handjobs.  A significant portion detailed Jimmy Norton's disastrous comedy performance at a Montauk yacht club, leading to discussions about comedians' insecurities.  Other topics included a Connecticut workplace shooting, a graphic violent movie, Joe Spinell's career, Otto's misspelled text message, an interview with Bernard Getz, doctors and healthcare,  more bad comedy gigs, and a past encounter with Jack Nicholson.  The show also mentioned Tiffany Haddish's previous appearance at a Montreal comedy festival.

The show then shifted to a discussion about zombie movies and their conventions, featuring guests Otto, Bob Kelly, and Jimmy Norton.  The hosts debated fast versus slow zombies, referencing films like *District 9*, *28 Days Later*, and *30 Days of Night*, and reminisced about classic horror films, including Italian horror directors like Lucio Fulci and Mario Bava.  They took listener calls, frequently interrupting and insulting the callers, awarding some Blu-ray copies of *Kick-Ass* and *Cop Out* for particularly bad calls.  One caller, Brian from Arkansas, launched into a lengthy, offensive racist and homophobic rant.  The segment also included a graphic description of a tasering incident and a sample of an abusive voicemail from Sandy Kane.  A news story auto-tuned to sound like a rap song concluded this segment.


The final segment began with a graphic discussion of the "Monsters Inside Me" show, specifically an episode about maggots in a child's eye, and further detailed descriptions of parasites and bodily fluids.  Guest Jimmy was present, along with Bobby Kelly who discussed filming for Louis C.K.'s show,  his auditions, and a humorous anecdote about his interactions with Opie on the Letterman show.  A lengthy, expletive-laden rant followed about Kelly's hotel room being given away for a bowling convention and his dealings with the club owner, Scott Bruce.  Phone calls resolved the issue with a room at the Ramada Inn.  The show concluded with the hosts and guests promoting their upcoming shows and merchandise, discussing touring experiences, merchandise sales, and travel exhaustion, with final plugs and thanks to the crew.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:00:30]  A box of chocolates that Forrest's mother was talking about.  You're a no-good son of a bitch, Bobby.  You motherfucking...  We're so much fucking better than you.  Absolute lunacy.  If you're giving me the hook, fine, whatever.  What's going on?  I do what I'm told.  I'm completely out of control.  It doesn't get better than this.  Come on.  It's shocking.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, the sound of wake the fuck up. 
[00:01:00]  Love it.  Wake up, everybody.  I'm glad I don't listen to this show.  This would be the most annoying fucking sound coming out of like a clock radio next to your bed.  Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up.  Hi, it's the Opie and Anthony program.  Good morning. 
[00:01:30]  Opie's still infirmed, as they say.  Infirmed.  Sickly.  Has strep throat, I think it was.  I got a few texts yesterday as Bobby Kelly tries to get Mars to blow him.  I got a few texts from Opie yesterday.  And, yeah, he's got like a strep throat, sore throat, no voice, just a wreck. 
[00:02:00]  But rumor has it, manana, as Mars says, manana, with that little thing over the end to make  it sound like meh.  But, but, I'm joined by the lovely and talented Robert Kelly today.  Robert Kelly, star of stage, screen, and television.  Bobby was Louis C.K.'s brother on an episode of Louis. 
[00:02:30]  Last night.  Last night.  Last night.  Did you see it?  No.  See, in this age of DVRs, what am I doing?  It's like, did you see it?  Because everything, you used to have to watch everything when it was on.  Now you don't.  No one does.  When do you watch a show when it's actually on?  Well, yeah.  When I'm on it?  When you're on it, yeah.  When my friends are on it?  Like, like Joy Behar.  That makes sense.  Joy Behar.  Joy Behar. 
[00:03:00]  It's Behar.  Wow.  Is it Behar?  Behar.  Is it Behar?  Yeah, there's no heart at the end of it.  It is to me.  It's just Behar.  Behar.  But, uh, I didn't even watch it.  You didn't watch it?  You were honest.  I know.  I didn't even watch it.  I just checked Twitter to see if I did well.  That's what I...  Isn't that what you do?  You go, eh, maybe I could catch it, like, at a later date.  I didn't go home last night until 1130 because I didn't want to watch it.  I just wanted to...  I didn't want to go in and watch it with my wife.  You're wandering around like Rupert Pupkin did, not looking at the Jerry show. 
[00:03:30]  I can't tell you what I did.  I'm married.  No.  I am.  I stayed out, yeah.  I actually was...  Because I wanted to go.  I didn't want to watch it with her, and if it did suck, if I blew, to have her go,  oh, baby, no, it's okay.  Yeah.  That's, you know, my wife can't lie to my face.  Yeah, you don't want to do that.  You want to first test the waters, a little bit of electronic media there, your Twitters,  your emails.  You want to get a little reconnaissance on your performance, and then you can get in 
[00:04:00]  and watch it DVR'd with somebody.  Right, especially these fans.  They'll fucking...  Oh, they're in too.  As soon as you suck.  Good job, faggot.  That's what it is.  I think my performance last night on the Joy Behar show garnered four blocks on Twitter.  I blocked four people for their critique of me.  I didn't...  I will block a motherfucker in a second now. 
[00:04:30]  It is the best thing, one of the best feelings ever is fucking hitting that block button,  but I'm such a sensitive twat that if I read one bad one, I'll start going through them  all, and anything I see, I'm just frantically blocking, and I block people who actually complimented  me.  Like, I'll go back and read the tweet, and it's like, dude, you didn't suck.  I just saw suck.  You block them.  I really love you.  Yeah, I just block them, and I gotta go back, and I bring people back, though, too. 
[00:05:00]  I don't think I've ever brought anyone back from the Twitter dead.  Really?  I never bring them back.  I block them, and then if somebody...  Because this happens, too.  You'll get the friend of the person you blocked will Twitter and say, dude, why'd you block  my friend?  And then you know where that gets you?  No.  Blocked.  Wow.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You're fucking Gestapo.  I'm fucking insane with it.  That's what I am.  I am a blocking Gestapo.  Twitter Gestapo.  I fucking thumbs up, thumbs down, get in the Twitter boxcar and off to Twitter Auschwitz, 
[00:05:30]  you motherfucker.  I don't need it.  I don't need it.  After years of being a slave to message boards and things like that, where you just had  a look at a post and go, you cocksucker, and there was no real recourse, you could just  get on and then post a fucking 20-paragraph answer that is concise and fucking well-thought-out, 
[00:06:00]  run-through spellcheck, grammatically correct, and then after it's just like, faggot can't  take it?  And you're like, yeah, why do I bother?  Now, block.  Don't need it.  It's fucking, it's great, but I unblock people.  Like, if they send me an email, I'll be like, dude, I'm going to be fair.  I have rules, though.  You have to put a smiley face.  You need a good begging.  No, right?  I need a begging if I block you, but if you're going to fucking smash me, I need a smiley 
[00:06:30]  face.  Yeah.  An XO.  Hugs and kisses.  Hugs and kisses.  Just one each.  Yeah.  Not fucking XOXO.  Or I love you, Bobby, just so I know that you're a fan of, you know, especially this show,  I'll know you're a fan of ONA.  Because if not, it's just the people who fucking hate you.  Back in the day, if you hated a fucking star, you had to climb a wall, fight security.  You had to get by cameras to get to that mother.  So if you had to fucking write a letter and lick an envelope to tell them how much, and 
[00:07:00]  they'll never see it.  Maybe they'll read that shit.  Now they can just write in your phone on the way to a gig when you already feel a little  insecure about the show.  Yeah.  And you're reading, you fucking faggot.  I hope you die.  It's like, what?  Yeah.  Right on your own phone.  You're reading shit like that just is bashing you.  So how did we get to that point?  Because we're low.  Are we insecure enough?  Or we're just pieces of shit that just want to be told by as many people as possible how 
[00:07:30]  great we are so we can wake up another day and do this shit job.  And plow through this shit one more time.  Exactly.  I don't know how you fucking do this fucking six, this five.  You must get up at four.  Now you know.  You saw me walk into the elevator at five to six.  That's how I do this.  I put my cigarette out.  I still had half a cigarette.  I was like, I got to get up there.  Maybe Anthony wants to do a little show prep.  What?  I'd walk in.  What's that?  You're walking behind me. 
[00:08:00]  I was walking in.  I got here after Bobby.  I was staying at the hotel.  Oh, that is.  So Kenny comes by and gets me.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't know why.  It's nice of Kenny.  Believe me.  I do appreciate that Kenny comes by and gets me.  But it's like a one block walk.  It's not very far.  I do like the fact he picks up the little suitcase. 
[00:08:30]  He will not let me roll my own suitcase down the sidewalk.  Kenny, I do appreciate it.  But why do you do that?  Oh, how about a mic there, Sam?  I like the way Kenny grabs the microphone, like it's his turn on the cock in prison.  Yes, Ken?  You know what my greatest fear is?  What, Kenny?  Not being there.  Really?  Yeah, like for instance, that terrible shooting yesterday in Connecticut.  Yes. 
[00:09:00]  If I was present during that exit interview, I probably would have saved lives.  I would have wrestled that gun away from that guy.  You would have wrestled or just made sure he wasn't letting off any more rounds?  Because I would have done what I had to do with what I got.  I hear you.  Kenny's also very bored because he doesn't have a lot to do.  Oh, damn.  Especially with only you here.  He doesn't have to take care of Opie.  He was sitting here down there at like five o'clock when he got in and just sitting next 
[00:09:30]  to Troy who was trying to get work done and saying, well, got to call Anthony in two minutes.  Got to call Anthony in three minutes.  Got to call Anthony in one minute.  And just looking at his phone and waiting.  Just waiting to call me.  Aw.  That's very sweet of you, Kenny.  I'm diligent.  He's got nothing going on.  He is diligent.  And then he's waiting down in the lobby of the hotel.  And then I barely get out of the elevator with my little rolling suitcase in my backpack. 
[00:10:00]  My backpack, as Sam says.  And he's got it in his hand.  He's very diligent.  But see, here's the thing, Kenny.  It's just a little thing.  And I think you know where I'm going with this.  You're a grown man and you don't need somebody to carry your fucking suitcase.  You go to the bathroom by yourself.  That is very good, Bobby.  And that is probably number two as to why, Kenny, really, it's not necessary that he does it.  I appreciate it, Kenny.  I appreciate it.  Right.  But it's not necessary.  Here's why. 
[00:10:30]  If, by chance, I am walking here and the proverbial shit goes down, don't you think I want a piece  of that?  Don't you think I want to jump in there and fuck a motherfucker up?  Yeah.  Don't you think he wants to use some of those bullets that he spent fucking millions on?  No, he shouldn't have to.  He's a very important person.  Yeah, but he wants to use a couple rounds. 
[00:11:00]  It would be kind of fun to just, you know, protect yourself.  Feel like a man.  You know, regardless, Bobby, I'm not even talking that.  I'm just talking maybe of a little martial arts.  You threw an upside down punch to the sternum.  That was when I came back with the other hand.  It goes upside down.  I saw it on a movie.  Yeah.  Ying Yang.  You'd break your fucking wrist if you threw an upside down punch. 
[00:11:30]  Little do you know.  Okay, look.  I probably wouldn't.  I probably wouldn't use my fist, but okay.  But I understand why you're there, though.  So just in case.  Yeah.  It is.  It's very.  And it is appreciated, Kenny.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I mean, I got to justify my job.  All right.  That makes more sense, at least.  You and everyone else around this joint.  Yeah.  The hardest job here.  Yes.  Staying awake.  Oh, damn. 
[00:12:00]  He didn't.  No, he didn't.  Sam's just jealous because he sucks on the radio.  So every morning, every morning since I started on Hits One, Kenny has come into this building  and pointed out a break that he didn't like.  He listens to my Hits One shift every morning on the way in here.  Isn't that every break, though, Kenny?  And tells me he doesn't like it.  They only let him talk three times an hour.  It's four times an hour, and that's the standard.  And do you give out your Twitter address still every single break? 
[00:12:30]  Not every break.  Oh, you got over that crutch?  Only when it's relevant.  It was a crutch.  He doesn't have to give it out anymore because the pad data says, tweet Sam at NotSam.  I don't control the pad data, Kenny.  You want to be famous so fucking bad.  He really does.  You want to be a fucking just a hit.  Of course I do.  You know what he said yesterday?  This is one of his breaks yesterday.  Hi, I'm NotSam.  No, it's not.  That wasn't one of my breaks yesterday.  Well, I'll paraphrase.  Can he tell the fucking joke? 
[00:13:00]  Jesus Christ.  He was wrong already.  Hands down, the worst break ever.  He goes, Katy Perry got her fiancee Russell Brand a $200,000 ticket to the moon.  Talk about bang zoom.  That wasn't it.  Holy shit.  Even if it's close to that.  It was close.  That's pretty fucking bad.  It was close.  But I'm also, I explained to Kenny, he's a man of a certain age at this point.  He's older.  I'm targeting a different audience than Club Soda Kenny.  Your audience wasn't even alive when the Honeymooners were on. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, bang zoom is.  Bang zoom to the moon is something people know, though.  They might not know where it's from, but they know the phrase.  Danny.  Maybe they know it from the Honeymooners remake.  Exactly.  With Cedric the Entertainer.  Maybe Cedric said it.  They know the Honeymooners.  It was in theaters.  Did he say it in the remake?  Do you think I would watch that?  He did.  Do you think?  He did.  He actually hit her, though.  Okay.  Because, you know. 
[00:14:00]  That'd be great if he actually just wailed his wife in the face.  Sam, the show, you do four breaks an hour.  Yeah.  You do things like bang zoom.  Sure.  Any I Love Lucy references?  No.  Or My Mother the Car?  No.  No?  I think, I thought bang zoom to the moon was well known and relevant enough that even  the kids today would at least sort of get it.  Do you know he never said bang zoom to the moon? 
[00:14:30]  I didn't know that.  He either said bang zoom or he went to the moon.  No, I said bang zoom to the moon.  Separate.  Never, never one right after another.  That's what I said.  I said she bought him a ticket on the spaceship.  Bang zoom to the moon, indeed.  End of the song.  Boom.  Hit the post.  I'd listen.  Who listened to the moon?  I'd listen to the moon with a mouthful of yogurt.  I'd listen to that shit.  The fucking putting on the pops.  The utter crap.  Hey, it's Sam.  I'm putting on the pops. 
[00:15:00]  You know who's really good on the radio?  Who, Kenny?  Troy Kwan on Liquid Metal.  Is Troy good?  Oh, yeah.  He knows what he's talking about.  Does everyone have a fucking shift around here?  Well, Troy's been on...  Is that what happens?  He's been on Liquid Metal since even before we got here.  But he's good.  But, like, he's got another job, doesn't he?  Yeah.  Like, everyone's got five jobs around this fucking place.  Well, Sirius' motto.  And they're still crying poverty.  Sirius' motto, do more with less.  Do more with less. 
[00:15:30]  They do.  Jesus.  Everyone does an air shift.  Yeah.  What?  Are they going to hire jocks?  Apparently not.  Hopefully not.  Yeah.  Jim Norton's got two other shows now.  Jim Norton's got two other shows.  Yeah.  You're doing a show.  Troy does a show.  But then I see everybody that has the shows is walking around doing, like, fucking clerical work.  Yeah.  I mean, they can't just hire a DJ.  If they're going to hire you for an air shift, they also got to make you do something else.  I have a show, too.  He's a co-host. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, right.  You're a co-host.  I'll butt that, and then I have tech hits, and I do all the techs.  No, you don't.  I do.  I have the tech hits with Bob Kelly.  It's on every Thursday.  Every other Thursday of every Wednesday.  Of every Wednesday.  Of every leap year.  Flying sack of shit.  That should be, though.  We were talking about you yesterday.  I heard.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  You called.  We were talking, and you are the tech guy, and Patrice has said, it's okay. 
[00:16:30]  Because you owned it, and if you want that, it's yours.  I'd like to claim something else.  I'm also the massage parlor guy.  I know what every massage parlor is in the country.  Don't you think Jimmy is that guy?  No, he doesn't like, he's not a big Asian.  I'm talking Asian.  They were Asian.  You're not a big Asian Yankee Cranky.  Oh, he's not a big.  He's not a big, you know. 
[00:17:00]  His place, like, I could go in.  I've been into basements.  Oh, really?  Oh, just a basement.  Dingy, musty.  With five-gallon buckets they're sitting on.  I've been in places where they're actually cooking, like, fish on a skillet, like a hot plate.  No way.  Oh, yeah, I did.  Oh, yeah.  I've been to some bad places.  Can I ask you why?  Why didn't you just pick a...  Because they're going to jerk me off at the end of it into a paper towel.  That's why.  There's not too many options.  But isn't there a better place you can go? 
[00:17:30]  Not in some places.  Back in the day, around 15 years ago, they actually had...  I remember in New York, they had hot chicks.  I mean, regular broads were in massage parlors.  Like, your normal American fucking girl that wanted to be a star ran off to the city.  Absolutely.  Ab met by the fucking guy at the bus station.  Absolutely.  That guy.  Dude, there was a place up on...  You look a little hungry.  I'll buy you lunch.  Okay. 
[00:18:00]  Where you from, baby?  Oklahoma.  And he strangles in the back of a fucking cab.  Oh, yeah.  All nice and good to her.  Gets her lunch.  She feels good.  And then gets her in the cab and then just looks over at her and clocks her in the fucking face.  Just belts her.  Why did you do that?  Because I love you, baby.  And the white cabbie's just looking back and just...  I love those 70s fucking prostitution movies.  They're always like that.  Eve Plum in her dramatic role after fucking The Brady Punch. 
[00:18:30]  Ends up getting pummeled by some black guy in a fucking Cadillac.  And then he turns her out.  That was great.  That was...  Dirty Harry?  Dawn.  No, Dawn Portrait of a Teenage Runaway.  And it was Eve Plum as Dawn, the prostitute.  A prostitute!  And it worked out just like that.  Like, every fucking movie was that.  The girl came from some small town, either running away from parents that weren't that bad. 
[00:19:00]  And they were just like, oh my god, you didn't make you a bed.  And then from a rich fucking family, I can't take this anymore, mother!  And she runs off.  Usually some shady friend at school talks her into it.  And she gets on that Greyhound bus, pulls into the city.  The second she steps off the bus.  Like, it's like fucking Neil Armstrong's foot hitting the moon.  The second her foot touches fucking pavement, a fucking pimp is all over her shit. 
[00:19:30]  You look lonely, baby.  You want to be a star?  Yeah.  And then, by 15 minutes later, she's sucking dick.  Pimps are gone, dude.  I know.  There's no pimps anymore.  The internet killed CDs and pimps.  Killed the pimp.  There's no streetwalkers anymore because of Craigslist.  You got any kind of internet fucking hookup you need.  Where's the pimp?  Where's the furry-hatted, huggy-bear-looking pimp?  Some nerd that knows how to do fucking internet stuff. 
[00:20:00]  I like the Asian places just because it is what it is.  And you get a massage.  You go in.  It's usually $45.  But back in the day, you used to walk in and it was regular broads and you get to pick  them.  Like, there was a place you used to have to hold a newspaper up.  You couldn't be in the lobby.  Every guy had a newspaper.  What was that?  Like a fucking...  I don't know.  A little message that you were there for Yankee Cranky?  No.  They didn't want people...  People didn't want other people seeing them. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, seeing them, seeing them.  So you had to hold a newspaper up in front of your face the whole time.  You couldn't take it down.  If you took it down, the lady would get kicked out.  So it's just all guys holding newspapers up in front of their face.  Like, in what kind of place was it?  It was like a building.  Just a regular apartment complex.  And you'd go up to the fourth floor and into an apartment.  And hold a newspaper up.  And they'd made a little lobby and you'd have a newspaper.  You'd walk in.  Everybody had newspapers. 
[00:21:00]  And then when it was your turn, they'd go, excuse me.  And you'd walk up.  You'd go into a hallway.  And around nine girls would come down and do a spin and then go.  Do a spin and then go.  And then you'd pick the one you wanted.  You'd do whatever you want with them for like $150, maybe.  Ass sex.  Anything you wanted, dude.  Wow.  Anything you wanted.  But now, you...  You didn't have to fuck them with holding the newspaper, did you?  Yes, you did.  Yeah.  Just pound away reading about health. 
[00:21:30]  Mayor Abe Beam is breaking New York City.  Abe Beam.  What the fuck?  Who the fuck is Abe Beam?  I was going way back.  See?  Because it was back in the day.  So you're holding an old newspaper.  I actually...  I like the Asian places now.  Because a lot of them have shitty breath.  And they smell.  But it's really...  Massage.  I actually...  This is fucked up.  Because what they do is they tease you the whole time.  Yeah.  They give you a regular...  You're on your stomach.  They give you the back rub.  And then they go to your legs. 
[00:22:00]  And then they start going, reaching in.  And then they'll almost reach...  Like, very at the end.  Like, you get an hour massage at 46 minutes.  Oh, shit.  They start tickling your sac.  And then they graze it.  And they'll giggle.  Like, oh, sorry.  Sorry.  I actually hurt my back in getting a massage.  Trying to lift my ass up in the air.  Oh, you're doing the cat in heat move?  Yeah.  Rawr.  Rawr.  Rawr.  Rawr.  Rawr.  Rawr.  You have to take your foot and hit him in the ass just to watch. 
[00:22:30]  I picked my asshole up.  Because they jerk you off from underneath.  They start grabbing your cock.  Wow.  So you pick your asshole.  And then they...  They'll, like, tickle your asshole.  So I picked my ass up and I got on my knees.  I'm literally in fuck me, my asshole style.  Now you're just like...  Your ass is sticking up in the air.  Right.  But I'm not used to getting fucked in the ass.  So my back...  Oh, you should work here.  Yeah. 
[00:23:00]  So my back...  I pulled the muscle in my back.  My back knotted up.  After getting an hour...  Like, a 45-minute massage on my back...  You got a backache from a massage.  Yeah, from trying to take it in the ass.  So she sticks her little pinky finger in my asshole.  Which they very rarely do now.  Yeah.  Yeah, very rarely do they give you a little asshole rub.  That sucks at, like, zero hour.  They just start fooling around with you.  They should do it more at the beginning and hook you up.  That's the best.  No, you do it at the beginning.  It's just a massage. 
[00:23:30]  Fuck that.  I want a massage.  I want to...  You're like a fucking jack job.  I like the...  What is this?  Cock milking.  Danny brought up some cock.  Yeah.  Is that your position?  Yeah, but I hurt my back doing that.  Dude, that is the best.  I want that right now.  Some guy is just naked looking hysterically silly on all fours on an old wooden table.  And this regular-looking girl has got his junk, like, pulled out from behind him. 
[00:24:00]  I like how it's a two-camera shoot.  It is a two-camera shoot.  Yeah, they're going back and forth.  Actually, maybe three-camera.  This could be a Desi Arnaz.  That was actually the close-up of the cock.  That was the cock's close-up right there.  Yeah.  And she's just milking away.  And she's talking.  What could she possibly be saying, Sam?  Instructions?  What could she possibly be saying?  Let's listen in.  I call that the Doverman Pinscher.  Yeah, it does look like a dog when two dogs are fucking, and they get hooked together ass-to-ass and look silly. 
[00:24:30]  It just looks silly.  He does look dumb right there.  I bet that feels good, though.  It feels tremendous.  Yeah.  If you're in shape and your back doesn't knot up.  You don't get a back spasm.  Is that what she was doing, though?  That backwards jerk thing?  That's exactly.  See what?  That might be a little painful.  No.  No, with that fucking wedding ring on, she's fucking doing it with. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  She turns it backwards.  Just diamond cutting into your fucking head.  How do we get here every day by this time?  What time is it?  I don't know.  It's 6.33.  It's probably some smutty thing is always on.  Look at her face.  Yeah, she...  What is that called?  Uh, the cock milking.  I'm fucking...  I'm getting the app for that right now.  That just looks a little...  It looks a little gay. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, it's definitely gay.  And it's a girl manipulating a guy, but there's something about it that just doesn't look completely  hetero.  How do you think it feels?  It probably feels great.  When you're on your...  No, dude, it's...  You gotta get past the getting on your knees and arching your back.  Yeah, because you're kinda...  Oh, wait a minute.  She's going in for...  No.  She just does strictly a jerk job.  Would you be able to keep a rod like that?  Because at some point in time, I would just be like, I feel ridiculous right now.  Yeah, yeah.  It feels silly, and I know it looks silly. 
[00:26:00]  I'm getting fucking crazy.  And then pulled back like that can hurt if you're really, like, raging.  You know?  You can't pull it back.  You can't hurt mine.  Like that, no?  No, it's not fucking...  It's not like 14 where it was just like fucking a flagpole?  No, I haven't gotten a fully hard in around eight years.  It's one of those ragers where it just like... 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, it hurts.  Like it ricochets off your stomach.  You can feel your heartbeat in your dick shaft.  Oh, God.  Jesus.  He's making his own fucking crazy glue.  Crazy.  That's amazing.  All right.  When's the money shot already?  You already had it.  I didn't do this all day?  That wasn't a money shot.  That was just dripping a little fucking loo.  Look at that. 
[00:27:00]  Now she's just using two thumbs.  Very talented.  That's fucking great.  If you could get a guy off with just two thumbs.  I've seen a few of these videos.  Yeah, look.  Oh.  What is that?  A little slow motion fucking...  She's barely doing anything.  She's singing.  What is she singing?  She's saying, I want it all.  A nice little cumpile you made.  What?  Who sings that song?  I mean, you don't need her saying things like, 
[00:27:30]  nice little cumpile you made.  Why not?  Girls can say some shit that take you right out of the mix.  Right out of it.  All right.  Left a little...  What an anticlimactic climax.  He just left nothing.  Oh, thank you, Sam, for turning the volume up.  All right.  On my accord.  Shit.  All right.  Enough of this.  She's drawing with his cock.  She's drawing in it.  I thought you guys just wanted to watch a little cock milk in this one.  I'm watching it.  Yeah, that was it. 
[00:28:00]  The backwards thing.  I'm not...  That looked a little gay.  I don't like my ass sticking up in the air with anyone behind me.  It is fucking...  I'm like just...  I'm not into that.  I'm such a faggot when it comes to that.  I don't mind the ass play on the girl doing that.  I'll do that in a second.  Like anything.  But just steer clear of mine.  And it's no fear of anything.  It's just...  And I love making sure everything's squeaky clean all over me. 
[00:28:30]  But just that is...  It just seems silly.  It is.  I don't think I'd get very excited because it would just make me feel gay.  Well, you know these...  Some of these massage parlors now, they're legitimate places.  Like you'll have some fat lady from England in the little thing next to you.  It's like they take like a one bedroom or a studio and they make...  They put like five massage tables in there and they put little curtains up. 
[00:29:00]  So some people are getting legit massages?  Right next to you and you're just...  You got to keep quiet.  Oh, yeah.  You got to...  Because some...  You can hear some British lady like, hey, can you do my calves?  And I'm just coming on a paper towel where some guy's going to fucking lie in around 10 minutes.  Yeah, you were the guy lying there, though, 10 minutes after some other guy.  That doesn't bug me at all.  No, you can put my face in a wet spot on one of those things.  I don't care.  It's disgusting.  I don't care.  Jesus Christ, is that disgusting? 
[00:29:30]  It's awful.  They're terrible places.  But the fact that she's giving you a regular massage and then at the end, they always pretend like, you know, is this okay?  They go in and go into the...  A massage is...  The natural buildup to a massage is coming.  Yeah, that's the...  Well, that's the end product.  Yeah.  You ever get a regular massage and they're rubbing your ass and they're doing your cheeks and your inner thighs, the natural progression is blowing a load at the end of that.  If you don't get to blow a load at the end of a fucking really good massage, you're going to kill somebody. 
[00:30:00]  But you know something?  That is also a sex move that a guy will use on a girl if it's the first time you're with them or you're doing something and you're not quite sure of how far something's going to go.  Right.  And, you know, maybe a little back rub, a little this, that, and the other thing.  And you start delving into areas that are a little more sensitive.  So, and then you look very diligently for the reaction. 
[00:30:30]  Anything.  A little twitch, an ass raising.  Yeah.  Breathing in air.  Yeah, yeah.  A deep breath.  Yeah.  A little ass wiggle.  Yeah.  And your hands go...  And then you're like, all right, all right.  But now you can't just go right in.  So you've got to go a little closer.  And again, constantly assessing the situation.  Right?  Don't you do that?  Yeah.  Until your finger brushes a lip.  And then you know.  If you don't get a fucking punch in the face, you're good. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  You're gold.  If you feel her pussy and it's like a camel's mouth after he ate a banana, it's just...  If he's angry and spitting at you.  Yeah.  Spitting camel.  When you rub the thighs, the inner thighs, and then you just go from one thigh to the other but via pussy lips.  And they go...  The lips are getting like a horse after you just fed them an apple.  They're just going...  And this thing's running out. 
[00:31:30]  It's beautiful.  It's a beautiful thing.  I like nice wet panties.  Oh, God.  That's fantastic, right?  What is that?  Is he spitting at his face?  Not the goat.  The goat is spitting at a guy.  It's great.  Good.  There is nothing better, girls.  Nothing better.  And I'm talking to both of you out there.  There's nothing better than sopping panties.  I like sopping panties.  I like...  I will make out with sopping panties.  What's the matter? 
[00:32:00]  No, no.  I swear.  It's great.  Wet.  You give a little, you know...  You give a little action to the tummy and the thighs and things like that.  And then when it's just sopped, you just go in and fucking just make out with wet panties.  I do like the dry...  It's a little dry on the outside, and then you break the seal.  You know, like when you touch a tent inside when it's raining?  All of a sudden, the drip won't stop. 
[00:32:30]  Why is that?  What is...  Why does a tent leak when you touch it?  Why do the panties get wet?  You know, when you're fucking abroad and you're pushing it in and it hurts, it hurts.  It's like, oh, fuck.  You get that head...  You get your head in, and then you push it, and then all of a sudden...  It's like breaking through the atmosphere.  You feel that fucking warm cake sensation?  Of course.  But it's...  Half of your dick is still dry.  Why is this the same conversation I had with my friends in our tree fort when I was fucking 
[00:33:00]  like 15 years old?  Not Richard.  No.  It's the same conversation.  I was like a kid.  Did you fucking suck a guy's cock in a tree fort?  No!  What happened in the tree fort?  No, Richard wanted to suck my cock.  Oh, you suck your cock.  Yeah, sorry.  Sorry.  I feigned sleep because he was my best friend for like three years.  And it's hard to, you know, go fishing and hang out and horseback riding with your best  friend and then have him want to suck your cock.  It does put a damper on the friendship.  Or it takes it to the next level. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, yeah.  Depending on anybody's frame of mind at the time, it can take it to the next level.  But, um, yeah, that was that.  And then I saw him many years later when we were both adults.  You had kids and a wife?  And that was creepy.  No.  Was it just fucking flaming?  All flaming.  Really?  Went hunting with me.  And we went out to California to see my dad.  It was me and Plankfoot.  And, uh, that's Joe Curry and my brother and a bunch of our friends just tore out to California.  And we all gear up to go pheasant hunting, uh, with my dad. 
[00:34:00]  We all got shotguns and shit.  We're heading up into the hills.  And, uh, Richard's there.  And he decided to go curtain shopping with Corey, my, uh, my father's wife.  We're all ready to go hunting and he's going curtain shopping.  And I was just like, yeah.  Yeah.  And it's very effeminate voice and stuff.  And, and it was all awkward because we were adults now.  Yeah.  And, and still, when I looked at him, all I thought was like the tree fort and how he tried 
[00:34:30]  to blow me.  Yeah.  So it was just like.  Before your cock was tainted.  And before, and then I find out he moved to a Lake Elsinore, uh, California, where he,  uh, died at a very young age of, of pneumonia.  Onya.  Onya.  Get it?  Yeah.  I don't get it, but yeah, I get it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I hope I don't get it.  Yeah.  I hope I don't get it.  So, uh, yeah, that, that, that is the follow-up ending to that story. 
[00:35:00]  That sucks.  Tree Fort Richard wound up getting the hiv and fucking, uh, dying at a very young age.  Wow.  Yeah.  Is anybody dying from the hiv anymore?  Uh, oh, it's still, you know, they still got the, uh, epidemic status.  Really?  Africa.  Does anyone die here anymore?  They just give them drugs and.  You get it like they have the cocktail, right, Sam?  Sam, right, Sam.  What are you taking for the AIDS?  I don't.  Sam, what do you got for your AIDS?  I don't have that. 
[00:35:30]  You get the new strand of AIDS, the twink AIDS.  Ooh.  Wow.  He can't bear to lose any weight.  He'd die in a day of AIDS.  You know how people hang in for fucking years?  Magic Johnson and shit.  They're all in shape.  Sam has no leeway with his weight to have even a cold.  I'd live till I was 90.  Yes.  I've had AIDS for 50 years.  It's wonderful.  I don't even feel it. 
[00:36:00]  I'm finally at the weight I wanted to be.  I'm at my goal weight.  Yes.  Sam, Sam looks like fucking lay in Philadelphia when they had the party.  You should get him a sailor suit.  Sam would look adorable in a sailor suit, wouldn't he?  God, what the.  Make him salute.  Yeah, not a, not a, not a, not a crackerjack.  The actual, the, the, the, the real one, the whites.  Yeah.  The end, like Richard gear at the end of fucking. 
[00:36:30]  Officer and a gentleman.  Yeah.  Oh, like a naval aviator.  Yeah.  Like Tom Hanks had in the fucking Philadelphia movie.  That'd be cool.  You could fucking pick up Bobo from Queens and you go girl.  I don't have AIDS.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  No.  That's something you never want to have to say.  But Sam does have AIDS forehead.  What's AIDS forehead?  It's just, you have a thin forehead.  It's like your forehead needs to gain weight.  Like the skin on your forehead is thin.  Yeah.  It's almost Klingon-like. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Uh, because your hair is pulled so far back.  You almost have a Klingon forehead and not the original series.  I'm talking, you know, next generation.  Worf.  Oh.  You have a Worf head.  You could be a fucking Klingon.  You're absolutely right.  And his upper lip.  He has that, he has that cat upper lip.  What's a cat upper lip?  Worf head.  You have Worf head.  Okay, I don't know about that.  Well, you don't have anything, any, you pulled all your hair back for so long that you wound  up getting a Worf head. 
[00:37:30]  I have a big forehead.  I think I look handsome.  Oh, you do look handsome.  Thank you.  But you do have some type of Worf head going on.  You do have a, it's those two fucking lines that the bones, you have two bones that protrude  out of the, protrude out of, protrude.  Protude, protrude, protrude, dude, dude, I say words, dude, and I fucking, you know,  I just say what I, you know what I mean, dude.  What the fuck is that?  Jesus Christ. 
[00:38:00]  What is that?  Worf wearing a fucking leprechaun outfit?  That's Worf from one of their terrible holodeck episodes, which I could never fucking sit through.  I hated the holodeck episodes of Next Generation.  I don't mind Star Trek for Next Generation.  It's not a bad Star Trek series, but the minute that they were, like, they just had nothing  and it was a whole holodeck show, I'm like, I gotta tap out, dude, I don't give a fuck.  I wish we could holodeck this show some days.  Yeah, the holodeck shows are like, oh, come on, right.  I don't want to see the crew in the 1800s.  They're dressed like fucking pirates.  They're dressed like fucking ancient Rome. 
[00:38:30]  Well, you're into space, y'all.  Hanging out with Shakespeare.  It's like, be in space.  Is that Picard?  Yeah, Jean-Luc Picard.  Computer, Earl Grey.  Hot.  That guy?  Yeah, I've never heard of Mortar T.  I never really watched all the Next Generations.  I catch, like, every time I tuned in, and I hate when this happens with a show, it was  the same episode.  Like, sometimes you only catch three episodes.  There are a thousand episodes of certain shows, and every time I tune in, it's like, I'll 
[00:39:00]  give it a try.  All right.  Fuck, I saw this one.  TBS says that with Seinfeld a lot.  It's like, they'll rotate the same eight Seinfeld episodes over and over again.  Like, there's fucking, like, what were there, nine seasons, something like that?  Of what, Seinfeld?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think so.  And they play, like, one season's worth.  When would Star Trek The Next Generation, when does that take place?  What year?  Way in the future.  That's it?  That's it?  Just way in the future?  They don't give a year?  23rd?  2300s?  2300s?  I don't know. 
[00:39:30]  When was the regular Star Trek?  That's a good question, Bobby.  60s?  60s?  Yeah, it was 66 to 68, I believe.  2364.  2364?  Yeah.  2364 through 2370.  Aw.  100 years after the original.  Have you?  So the original was supposed to be 2264?  That came a long way.  Yeah.  That's 100 years.  That, and then you watch, like, the, it takes you out of the mix, but you watch the redo, 
[00:40:00]  which was fantastic.  I loved the newest Star Trek that they made, where they got, and recast it, but it's supposed  to be a prequel to the original, and the equipment is 8 million times better than the original  show equipment.  Right, right.  But it's supposed to be the future.  That kind of takes me out of it.  But they can't have a shitty cardboard set.  It's not just a red, green, and a blue button.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's the stupid fucking digital readout that would just spin, time is going  backwards, Captain. 
[00:40:30]  And it's like your old flip digital clock, alarm clock.  It's just a fan.  It would just go back, the numbers, boop, boop.  They'd have one sound on the bridge.  When they had radar, too, they would just be that circle.  Yeah.  Like an outline of the exact animal that's coming.  Yeah, their radar just ruled.  Just had a rhino coming down.  And when they go into orbit of a planet, the planet had no clouds or anything, or an  atmosphere.  It was like they took a globe and just shoved it in a dark room, put a light on it. 
[00:41:00]  Stunk.  What show is, what show, it has to be a show that did the future back then, but it was  now, and we haven't, we haven't done it yet.  Oh, Space 1999 was one of those, with a moon, they had moon bases, and then the moon blew  up.  Oh, that was the guy that was also in Mission Impossible, and he was in Ed Wood.  He played Bela Lugosi in Ed Wood.  Right, yeah.  Martin Landau?  Yeah, Martin Landau was the big star of that one. 
[00:41:30]  He goes to the IHOP in West Hollywood every day.  How do you know?  Because when I was there for three months, I'd go to the IHOP every day.  That fucking guy would be sitting there every day.  That's him right there, see?  That's him every day.  That's him young.  And that's his wife.  That's so cool.  Barbara Bain was his wife, and he had to work, imagine having to work on a show with your  wife all the time, like fucking Voss and Bonnie do.  That's the Voss and Bonnie of 1966. 
[00:42:00]  That show stunk.  Space 1999.  That sounded so futuristic.  I remember that show.  I don't know what the fucking, what was the, what was the, oh, yeah, this is the big  theme.  Very dramatic.  And their ship just sucked ass.  It looked dumb.  Looks like a bone with a cock head on the end of it.  Yeah, cock head.  Damn.  And then they completely, what's with the disco thing? 
[00:42:30]  What year is this?  What the fuck?  In 1974?  What year did this come out, Danny?  Because it was a shitty show.  God, what a horrible show.  Oh.  75.  No way.  Yeah, 75 to 77.  I don't buy that.  Two years, it's a, ah, that's funny.  Space 1999.  A British science fiction.  Oh, that's why it sucked, too.  Anybody get into Doctor Who? 
[00:43:00]  Doctor Who's big now.  Why, though?  Doctor Who's big because it's coming.  Right, shut that off.  They got a new, ah, they got a new series on, I think, BBC.  Does he still wear that shitty fucking jacket, that brown jacket with the turtleneck?  But it's so stupid.  Like, he's a dumb fucking looking typical English guy.  And is he in space?  And what, what is that?  I never got into it.  I never got into it either.  It just looks so dumb.  And people try to get me into it, and I'm like, no. 
[00:43:30]  I don't get it.  I'll tell you what was a good show.  Firefly.  What was that?  That was a good show.  Never heard of it.  Look at that guy.  The theme was the best, though.  With his dumb ass, bro.  Yeah, see his stupid jacket?  He always had dumb clothes.  With a big scarf.  Who was your favorite doctor?  Because, you know, they changed doctors.  Did they?  Yeah, that's like part of the whole gimmick.  So there's always like a new doctor.  A new doctor?  I guess it was this guy.  No, I hated this guy.  Yeah.  Is this the theme, too? 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, it's rock so hard.  Doctor Who rocks so hard.  No, it doesn't.  Oh.  Yeah, play that theremin.  The Moog synthesizer.  This stunk, too.  God, there really was nothing to watch back then.  And this was on, like, PBS all the time.  Please send your contributions in to TBS.  Or TBS.  What am I saying?  TBS.  Buy some new Seinfeld episodes, please.  Why am I an asshole?  PBS.  Because it's seven.  That's why. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  I'm fucking exhausted already.  My eyes are shutting.  No, PBS always had, like, Doctor Who on.  And you'd be like, why?  I don't want to watch this.  Was it you?  Because occasionally they'd show a tit on PBS.  Like, Monty Python would come on and you'd see, like, an animation tit.  How great was it back then when we weren't desensitized to tits?  Oh, well, you'd see a tit and just fucking.  Oh, Benny Hill?  You'd get, like, that feeling.  Your breath and breathing would kick up.  Remember Benny Hill?  Yeah.  They never showed anything, but it might happen that he might just get his cock sucked. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, fuck.  One of these chicks would be running around in fast motion.  You'd see a lot of cleavage.  Yes.  A lot of big English broad tit.  Benny Hill was the best.  What a fucking pedophile.  Just a creep in that little old man.  The little old man running around chasing fucking young girls.  Benny Hill eyebrows were the funniest.  Yeah, that was, uh, everybody in school would talk about Benny Hill. 
[00:45:30]  But again, that show was even kind of just silly.  For back then, it was all right, though.  Yeah.  When you were a kid?  Maybe I was a kid.  You had to go to PBS, though, for a little bit of tit.  Maybe they'd do a National Geographic thing and you'd see some tit.  Yeah, like, skirts were always blowing up and you'd see panties and things like that.  But, yeah, we weren't desensitized to it at the time.  So, you're breathing, we'd get like.  Yeah, that back in the day with the skirt up and the thigh highs. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, my God.  There was always that, uh, we're gonna, last episode of the season, we're just gonna rape  five chicks on the show.  I had to go see a Barbarella in a drive-in with my dad and Corey, his wife there, and  sit in a fucking, a pickup truck, and I was in the, in between the two of them, and the  beginning opening sequence is pretty much her, naked, spinning around through space,  kind of a, kind of a James Bond-ish thing. 
[00:46:30]  Right.  And it was almost a little in silhouette, but you could see her.  I started breathing so heavy in this truck, the windows were getting all fogged up, and  I'm sitting between my father and his fucking wife, but I couldn't control myself.  Like, I couldn't breathe normal.  It fucked me up.  Like, I was trying so hard.  Just a big, raging kid boner.  It was so embarrassing.  Just pulsing through your tiny whities.  It was raining, it was raining inside the fucking truck, the, the, the condensation 
[00:47:00]  on the, on the windshield.  I've never seen Barbarella.  Yeah, she does this, and then she takes that space suit off, and she's all fucking,  like, naked.  Yeah.  You know how hot this was to a, to a, a kid?  She takes a dumb fucking futuristic space suit off.  And when was this supposed to take place?  In the future of 1985?  Yeah.  And she's floating through space, getting naked. 
[00:47:30]  She was hot back then, huh?  Yeah.  You see her now?  She's a fucking mess.  She turned all commie.  She's a...  The plot says that it was in the 40th century.  Wow.  Okay, that's way in the fucking future.  All right, they, they bought themselves a little time.  I like when they buy themselves a lot of fucking time.  40th fucking century.  Jesus.  There's not even going to be a copy of that left by then.  Because some things just, they really fucked up.  2001, a space odyssey.  We don't have a space station like that. 
[00:48:00]  That's what I'm talking about.  What?  That's 2001 where they fucked up.  We don't have that.  It's 2000.  The year 2000 made a lot of things that, that fucked up.  Because people in the 60s and 50s, when they would make these sci-fi movies, always thought  the year 2000 was going to be, holy shit.  I was sitting in a diner once.  And, and it's like 2000 something, whatever.  And I'm sitting, uh, with my girl at the time.  And I just, I had to bring it up.  I go, I go, look outside. 
[00:48:30]  There's still wooden poles with wires on them.  And, and fucking lights hanging in the middle of streets.  So cars can know when to go and stop.  I go, you could look at the fifties and see the same fucking shit.  They look better.  They work a little better, but it's still a wooden pole with wires on it and tar on the  street.  Yeah.  But if you go stand in front of forever 21 in times square, they have a huge screen that  you can see yourself on and a girl come pick you up by the head.  Yeah. 
[00:49:00]  Is that what's going on over there?  I was there for fucking two hours yesterday.  I would go there for the girl with the pocketbook.  Love forever 21.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, the store's great.  Oh, my God.  You could just stand outside and jerk off until someone else takes you away.  It's not the girl with the little purse.  Security.  Security.  You go jerk off.  I'll stand out in front and stop the girls that shouldn't go in there.  Not forever, honey.  Yeah.  It didn't work out.  Just a saying.  I do that.  They don't mean it literally. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  It's not forever sizes.  Beat it.  I do that, too, but I do it at Claire's Accessories.  Is that at Claire's Accessories?  Claire's Accessories?  Nothing more embarrassing than taking your girl into Claire's so she could buy little fuzzy  feather hair clips for her pigtails.  Yeah.  You know.  Back to school.  There are some embarrassing moments that do happen when you're a fucking pederast.  I bet you have an easy button for fucking pencils and pens and rulers. 
[00:50:00]  That is terrible.  What are you going to do?  Come on.  Help me out.  Oh, I'm fucking...  You know what we're going to do?  It's been an hour.  Did I get my sandwich yet?  Oh, no.  It's usually here by now.  Well, Kenny.  Because some people were bitching yesterday.  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  Jesus Christ.  He burst in like Kramer.  The door's stuck.  Now the door is stuck open.  I'm going to eat my sandwich so I'm not doing it on the air. 
[00:50:30]  And then when we get back, oh, my God.  Bobby Kelly.  You're going to cock milk me.  I'm going to cock milk Bob.  You asshole.  I'm going to cock milk Bob.  I was telling Bobby earlier about the wonderful and talented Jimmy Norton.  He sent me a text yesterday and it was, he goes, Anthony, check out this chick I'm fucking.  And I'm like, what?  So I click and it was a picture of his ball sack so close and he's holding his dick up like pulling it. 
[00:51:00]  And it was taffy dick.  He didn't even have a heart on it.  He just like pulled taffy dick so his nuts were pulled up and just snapped a picture at like macro focus range.  I just started cracking up.  I'm sitting at a bar looking at a man's ball sack on my iPhone and just laughing. 
[00:51:30]  Jimmy is hysterical.  He'll, uh, Jimmy should be joining us at some juncture here.  Uh, I know his plane's late.  Kenny, info, please.  His plane just landed and is taxiing to the gate.  Oh, good.  Oh, very cool.  Right.  He has a driver standing by for a curbside pickup.  Fucking A.  Yeah.  That's correct.  We'll be ready.  Looking forward to Jimmy Norton joining the show.  Good.  With Robert Kelly.  Bobby, where are you going to be?  I'm going to, I'm going to be your own fucking plug. 
[00:52:00]  I'm going to, I'm fucking.  I love this show.  Your own fucking plug.  All right.  Uh, off the hook comedy club.  I fucking hate listening to myself on this show.  Why?  I fuck.  I'm just, I'm okay.  The listeners.  Yeah.  I'm all, you know what?  Occasionally I'll give it up.  I do, but I was on the way here.  I was just like, shut the fuck up.  Fuck off the hook comedy club.  Is that Captain O'Brien's restaurant? 
[00:52:30]  Captain O'Brien or Captain Brian?  Whatever he is.  All right.  Well, you fucking all whipped up.  Whatever he is.  Captain Brian.  You have, he's, I don't, I'm not, I'm not calling him fucking captain, but he owned a boat in Boston.  He insists.  So now it's Captain?  Yeah.  He insists on calling himself Captain.  It's not happening.  It's like the maestro.  I can't have enough fucking Seinfeld references today.  What the fuck is going on?  Yeah.  He's Captain, Captain Brian.  It's off the hook comedy club, August 19th through the August 22nd of this month. 
[00:53:00]  And then at the end of the next week, very next week, Anthony, I don't take breaks.  I'm bringing my comedy caravan across this fucking beautiful nation of ours to, cause  we need jokes.  We need laughter.  We need to laugh during these trying times.  Yeah.  You're not going to pay $70 a ticket to see me.  You're going to pay 10 to 15.  You understand people are unemployed.  Things are tight.  You're giving them a little break.  And I'm kind of famous.  I'm hoping last night's episode will fucking shoot me to the top. 
[00:53:30]  Come on.  Oh, he'll fucking, you know, Louie will fucking just have a new brother just to be weird.  Oh, I'll just be a, you know what?  I want Todd Barry to be my brother this year.  Every year it's a new brother.  Why would they, why would he do that to you?  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  That's just my brain.  I suck.  But it is kind of something Louie would do.  He is crazy.  Richmond Funny Bone.  I'm going to be there August 26th.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:54:00]  Through the 29th.  Are you going to hang out with your friend Buzz Barton and sing karaoke?  Oh, fucking Buzz.  Please fucking get Buzz on the internet.  Is Buzz good?  He sings karaoke.  In my ways, it's claimed to fame.  Fucking, it's on the internet.  And I watched it a hundred times.  You've got to have a bigger repertoire than just my way.  He lives in Richmond, Virginia.  My karaoke repertoire is getting quite large thanks to Danny over here.  You're talented. 
[00:54:30]  Thank you, Danny.  Buzz is good.  Is he good?  Have you heard it?  Ex-cop.  No, I'm going to have to hear.  We'll find a little during the break and maybe play some of that because I love karaoke.  Oh, I can't get enough of it.  I've watched you at fucking three in the morning.  I'm live from the compound with Danny drunk with a cowboy hat fucking sleeping behind you.  I've lived the life of foal.  Suck my cock, you 18-year-old hoa.  I don't know if those are the ones.  Sam getting milked by Travis. 
[00:55:00]  I'd pay for that.  Getting jizzed in his shitty beard.  That's a wonderful rendition.  Dude, you look brilliant.  I've got to do another one of these.  People are clamoring for my karaoke with guns.  I like the .50 cal sniper.  Yeah, the .50 cal one was very good.  This is the one that made it.  This got a lot of play. 
[00:55:30]  A lot of play.  See, the trick is to sing seriously and look ridiculous.  Very dramatic part.  Hello.  Is it me you're looking for?  I can see it in your eyes.  I can see it in your smile. 
[00:56:00]  You're all I've ever wanted.  My arms are open wide.  By the way, I have an AK-47 and a Desert Eagle on me.  And a Nostromo shirt from Alien.  I want a psychopath.  I can't even watch this and I'm thinking, why did I do this?  You point with a gun.  Yes, I love you and you point with a gun.  Thank you, Sam, for the volume. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, that was fun.  I got to do that again.  You sing.  But you sing great.  You have such a gentle voice.  Voice like an angel, Robert.  Oh, my God.  I try.  I guarantee you, you're going to be huge on those fucking websites.  That one kind of wound up in a few places.  What are those fucking goddamn gorillas?  What are they called?  What are the fucking rednecks in the middle of the country now?  They're not KKK militia.  The militia guys.  They switched it up. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, look at this man.  He's got some good weapons.  Good chops.  And he can sing so he can entertain the militia.  We should try to get him for the next barbecue.  I'd love to see you at a rally.  Oh, so would I.  They wouldn't have me.  I'm a little too Mediterranean.  Mediterranean.  That's how I like to put it.  Mediterranean.  Just shave your head.  You know how hard it was to hold that gun during that entire song?  It's got to be like fucking 100 pounds, right?  Thank God I've been training.  That gun is very heavy. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, that's all up on my YouTube site.  It's O-P-A-N-T-X-M.  That's my little site to check out my videos.  I'm going to work on my radio voice for the rest of the show.  I'm going to talk a little different.  A little deeper?  Yeah, my voice.  See that?  It's a little.  You don't want to be nasal and squeaky on the radio.  I'm going to try to slow it down.  Okay.  And, you know, bring it a little slower.  And be more precise with what I'm trying to say. 
[00:58:00]  And when I'm going to say it.  And a little deeper.  A little deeper.  And I'm going to try to pronounce my R's inside of the word.  Oh, so it's not so accent.  Why?  Like New York.  Yeah, well, it's not going to be as nasally.  And it's going to be more precise.  That's good.  Use this show to train for the radio.  That's great.  Yeah.  Just a little training ground.  Instead of maybe doing it in a studio somewhere where no one's listening.  And it's not a kind of an important program here on the platform. 
[00:58:30]  I'm sensing frustration in your voice, Anthony.  Well, that was very articulate.  You really did pronounce every syllable.  Yes.  All right.  I did.  We're going to take a break.  We'll get back.  And I want to hear about what you've done to your goddamn iPhone.  That's it.  Don't say another word.  We're going to take a break.  Be right back.  And now picking up where they left off.  The O.P.  Anthony Show continues.  Quite the staple song of the 90s. 
[00:59:00]  Bringing you right back to the 90s.  Hi, O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P.'s out. 
[00:59:30]  He's sickly.  He's sickly today.  But he is hinting that tomorrow he's coming back.  Tomorrow.  Me and Nina.  So hang in there.  Hang in there.  I guess he talked to Dr. Steve, our resident physician.  And he wound up getting strep throat or something.  Ouch.  Ow.  You don't want that.  Especially with a baby around.  I'd be scared shit to get sick and then have a baby around. 
[01:00:00]  Because then it's like, oh, my God.  If I get the baby sick, that's got to make you feel a little guilty.  Poor little guy's like, wah, wah.  You did this to me.  Wah.  What'd you do?  Come fucking.  Did you just come sprinting back after a cigarette?  And now you're breathing like a marathon runner?  Yeah.  You okay, Bob? 
[01:00:30]  You weren't even sprinting.  I just ran.  I was just walking.  It was just a walk.  I ran from the door to the seat.  Oh, okay.  I did a jump.  Try to make it look like you were running the whole way.  Yeah, I was Friendly Bob on the elevator today again.  I hate Friendly Bob.  Unfortunately, Friendly Bob was friendly with Jeremy Coleman, who was in the elevator.  Oh.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Well, I'm friendly.  I'm just friendly.  Was Jeremy Friendly back?  Yeah, it was a good exchange.  Jeremy used to be our boss back at NEW, or one of them. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He was under Ken Stevens.  Nice guy.  Not under Ken Stevens.  Well, like, with.  All right, look.  I'm going to leave it at that.  He was there with him.  Yes.  Exactly.  All right.  Got no problem with that.  So how was?  Very friendly back.  Yeah?  Yeah, very friendly back.  That's nice.  I could tell Sam was very uncomfortable.  He's a slight man.  He's nice.  Nice guy.  Yeah, I am.  Very nice in the elevator.  Very sweet.  Yeah, people like Friendly Bob. 
[01:01:30]  No, they don't.  No, the people.  People are uncomfortable with Friendly Bob.  When you pulled Friendly Bob on the elevator the other day with those two girls, I was mortified.  I couldn't get off of that elevator quickly enough because you don't stop.  Like, anyone will say hi to you on an elevator just to be courteous, and then when they turn  their head away and start looking at the numbers ticking down to see what floor they're on, it  means I really don't want to have a conversation.  But you keep asking questions and commenting on things, and it's uncomfortable. 
[01:02:00]  You know what?  Someone once told me there's no such thing as a dumb question.  You have to.  You have to.  Have you heard the show with Voss on it?  Those are dumb answers.  Both.  Questions, answers.  Anytime his mouth is open.  How did you make your DVD?  What did you do there?  Did you burn something?  I heard you could burn movies.  Is it too hot for my computer? 
[01:02:30]  Dolt.  When's he coming in?  I'm sure soon.  Sorry, Rich.  It's like whoever's in here gets to beat up whoever's not.  Yeah, I know.  Yesterday it was you.  Oh, God.  Yesterday we were talking about the iPhone versus Joe DeRosa's Evo.  The Evo that he was so very proud of.  Last one in town. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, last one in town.  And he was so very proud of it.  And no one gave a flying fuck.  Now we're pretty much all, look at us.  We're iPhone people.  Oh, yeah.  Yet I feel left out because what I have found out is Primetime Sam Roberts and even Bob Kelly.  Now when Primetime did this, I just blew it off as, all right, Primetime fucked up his shit.  He's just a kid.  He broke his toy.  You know, one of those things. 
[01:03:30]  Mommy will yell at him.  But now Bob is the tech guy.  We know this.  We talked about it yesterday.  And Bob, I found out now, did the same thing.  Jail broke your phone.  But this is the best part.  You can do it from your phone now, Sam informed me, before you used to have to hook it up.  It was this whole process.  It takes 90 seconds now.  But I'm afraid because I know you have to at some point back up your phone on your computer.  You have to then update your phone when various updates come out. 
[01:04:00]  Now, what does jailbreaking do when you have to do that?  You have to restore your phone.  Right.  That's it.  To the last backup.  So your phone will go back to what it was at the last backup.  Right before the jailbreak.  Right before the jailbreak.  And then you can download.  It's just like it was.  Then you update it.  And then you can jailbreak it again.  And then you jailbreak it again.  But this used to be a pain in the ass because you used to have to plug it in.  That already sounds like a pain in the ass.  All you have to do is go to the website on your phone and slide your finger and it's jailbroken again. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  That's it.  Two seconds.  Should I do this?  Oh, yes.  Do it right now.  Do it right now.  Right now.  Do it right now.  All you have to do.  No, I'm afraid.  Just do it.  Fuck that.  If you go to the website.  I've got to back my phone up.  All right.  Just go to the website on your phone and just look at it.  Shut it.  I'm not going to do this.  Just do it.  Just do it.  Just try it.  Just do it.  Is it illegal?  No.  Not anymore.  Not anymore.  Because Whoopty is saying Apple says it's illegal.  No. 
[01:05:00]  No.  Apple says it can still void your warranty.  Oh, Travis.  Travis.  They say it'll void your warranty.  I was told I'm supposed to say who's talking.  Oh.  Like that's why I go, oh, Danny.  Oh, Travis.  Oh, Sam.  It's like because the listeners, they don't know the different voices.  This is what I heard in a meeting one day.  Right.  So I decided, you know what, I'm going to take that to heart, and the one thing I'm going  to listen to, as far as sitting in a meeting, I agreed to listen to one thing.  And that's it. 
[01:05:30]  And that's identifying who's talking.  Mm-hmm.  So that was Travis saying that it voids the warranty.  Yes.  Now, what type of warranty do I have, Travis?  You're very up-to-date and hip on the iPhone.  If I'm right, it probably has to do with, like, AppleCare.  Like, if something happens to your phone and you bring it in to, like, a Genius Bar, you  know, and if you jailbroke your phone, they'll say, well, that voided the warranty, so we  don't have to fix this.  Question.  Question.  What if my phone is jailbroken?  Then I back it up to the previous un-jailbroken and then bring it in. 
[01:06:00]  If you restore it, it un-jailbreaks it, and then you're cool again.  And they never know?  They don't know.  They can't look and go, I'm seeing that you jailbroke this.  No.  No, it's just some schmucks who work in this.  They don't know.  Oh, don't call him that.  No.  Except for the guy.  I have many good friends that work at the Apple stores that keep me from standing on  very long lines.  They'll never know.  They'll never know.  They're not going to say, oh, you jailbroke this, and then, no, they'll just be like,  oh, look at this.  It's got our Apple operating software. 
[01:06:30]  See, but I just broke-broke mine.  Right.  See, it's cracked in the back.  Right.  Mine isn't jailbroken.  It's just broken.  You didn't have a finger ring.  You didn't have a finger ring, dude.  You got to get the Bob Kelly finger ring.  Yeah, I'm working on it.  You have to get the finger ring.  I wish we were on the air when Bob said, who sold it to him?  He certainly didn't say, a black gentleman on the street.  Bobby has other inventions, too, that I'm sure he'd love to tell everybody about.  Yeah?  I do.  Well, you know.  The finger ring is a ring, and it's connected to a string, and it goes on your phone, so you 
[01:07:00]  don't drop it.  Right.  You put your finger in the little ring, and then you're tethered to your iPhone, so you  don't drop it in the turlet, and you're taking a whiz, or if someone bumps into you, yes,  and it hits the ground.  The finger ring.  True.  Yeah, you get surprised.  Like, watch Bobby.  Watch this.  Anyway, so I'm talking, hey, Bobby!  Oh, wow!  And then he would have dropped it, but the finger ring protected that.  Oh, God.  Thank God I had the finger ring, dude.  That was better acting than your Louis appearance. 
[01:07:30]  I was good last night.  I was actually really good.  I got to see it.  I really do have to see it.  I was actually surprisingly good, and, you know, it was good.  It was very well edited.  And FX picking Louis up for another season.  Yesterday.  13 more episodes.  Yeah, they just found out yesterday they're picking up for season deuce.  That's fantastic.  That's crazy.  That's great.  It's great.  Congratulations, Mr. CK.  We all love Louis CK.  He's a funny motherfucker.  That's such a great show.  And, yeah, good show.  It's a great show because it's not... 
[01:08:00]  Because you're in it?  No.  It's a great show because I'm in it.  It's not like I'm paying my mortgage off.  I got to go to fucking Red Lobster.  Ooh, fine dining.  Yeah, it's not fucking huge money.  It's not like, you know, a regular...  Well, you get your face out there.  You never know what's going to happen.  Fucking dude, it's the greatest show.  And that actually, the episode, the first one that I was in with the diner scene, they  showed it at the premiere. 
[01:08:30]  And that's what actually got me the little tiny spot I did on Curb yesterday.  Oh, shit.  Really?  Yeah, I mean, I'm assuming Jeff Garland, who is a great guy, he was there, and he was  like, yeah, it was really good, man, really good.  And then I got called in, and he was in the audition, and, you know, he came up yesterday.  He just, you know, they just fucking, he was like, oh, yeah, give it, you know, give  it to this guy or whatever.  He definitely helped.  Great guy.  What was your part in Curb?  That's pretty cool. 
[01:09:00]  We had to yell at, I don't know if I can tell you.  Oh, hey, then go fuck yourself.  I don't care, then.  What the fuck?  It's actually very funny.  I'll just say Bill Buckner's in it, which is great.  What?  It's going to be a very funny, it's very funny.  They won't give you the script.  You don't get lines.  I could kind of figure it out.  You literally, you go in for the audition, and it's one sentence.  That's all they give you.  One sentence, and then you go in with Larry.  And the producers and everybody. 
[01:09:30]  And you just act out there.  It's all improv.  Yeah.  And you just do it.  And then you leave.  And that's it.  But they were fucking just gone.  It's a little scary.  No, fuck that.  It's so much.  Dude, you know how many times I fucking learned 14 pages of text to go in and get, thank you,  like two seconds, thank you, bye, and never hear from them again?  I was up for two days all night walking to the, the worst part of doing an audition with  lines and fucking learning all that shit.  And when you leave, you're still doing them. 
[01:10:00]  I'm in the elevator, and I'm still going, so anyways, Kathy, I really like, ah.  It's over.  For days.  It's over.  You worked your ass off to learn all, you know how hard it is to memorize 14 pages of text?  I'm terrible at memorizing.  Dude, it's a, it's a motherfucker.  To go into an audition, nothing, no, just go in, do this.  You want to do this to this guy.  Just in front of some guy sitting there looking at you.  That doesn't even fucking faze me anymore.  It's the lines.  When you fuck up.  Why don't you just get up on all fours naked, pull your dick back behind you. 
[01:10:30]  Right.  And do your lines that way.  Start milking myself.  Start milking yourself.  That's got to be intimidating, though, just having some guy sitting there judging your  performance without it in context of, you know, the set and another actor.  That's what you want is when you go in with producers and the guy, Larry David was in  the room.  How crazy is that?  That's what you want because you're eliminating five steps.  When you go into a room and it's a casting director with an assistant in front of a fucking  camera, you know, you're never going to get seen. 
[01:11:00]  Callback.  You're never going to get seen.  If you're lucky.  Dude, there's a hundred guys on videotape and then there's guys that go right to producers  like famous people that.  How'd you get that fucking thing then where you went right in front of Larry David?  I told you that Louie show.  Oh, he saw me there.  And I don't know.  I mean, they just called me in.  It was, you know, Jeff Garland is a really great guy.  Really going on to bigger and better things.  I hope so.  Cause I suck at radio.  I don't want to wake up at six in the morning, do this fucking show. 
[01:11:30]  I'm fucking, I'm very excited to be here filling in on my, with my new voice that  that is good.  That is good.  Yeah.  And again, Jimmy will be here at some point, but whatever.  And also I think Otto, yeah, Otto's coming in later on in the, in the, in the  program, eight 30 or so.  We'll have Otto come in to hang out now about the jailbroken phone since we took a  little tangent.  Yes.  What is so good about it?  Like why sell me on it?  What is so good about the risk of voiding the warranty or, or, or wiping out everything 
[01:12:00]  I fucking have?  First of all, you're a fucking gazillionaire.  No, I'm not that fucking.  All right.  You're a thousandaire.  Like Patrice puts it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  So you, you can buy a new phone.  It's only 300 bucks.  What's the risk?  I don't want to lose everything on my phone.  You won't.  Is it backed up?  You already backed it up, right?  Yeah.  But you know, you always add new shit.  So you got to kind of back it up all the time.  What have you added since you backed it up?  A couple of apps, you know, some fucking contacts you get shit like that. 
[01:12:30]  You know, pictures, shit like that.  Pictures.  All you have to do is when you go home today, back up your phone, plug it in and back it  up.  Well, I will, but you know, that's why I don't want to jailbreak it right now.  You can still back up your phone when it's jailbroken.  Yeah.  Just go home and back it up.  But I don't want to jailbreak it.  If it fucks up my phone and I lose all my pictures and everything.  That's what I'm saying to you, that you're backing it up today and you'll have those.  You'll just go back to that backup.  Yeah.  I'm not.  Why?  I'm waiting.  It won't, it won't screw up your phone. 
[01:13:00]  Because you know why?  What?  Because I have like new pictures on my phone, nude pictures, new pictures on my phone.  And if something happens to it, those aren't backed up yet.  I just said back, go home today.  Yeah, I'll do.  I'll do that.  No, but you can, but you want me to, you want me to jailbreak it right now?  Bob Kelly did it in the office before the show.  It's not going to fuck up your photos.  It'll fuck up.  But this is the best part is that you can customize your phone to, you can have your 
[01:13:30]  phone when you open it, you know, the slide, it's a fucking gun.  Or a fingerprint.  And then people will think it has to read your fingerprint.  It doesn't really slide it.  It's just a picture of a fingerprint.  It's a gun slider.  And when you slide it, it goes, or you can have it that when you slide it, it goes.  And then, okay, not really selling me on the risk of fucking my life up.  You're not going to fuck your phone up.  It could be a gun, Anthony.  See the service bars?  I have guns.  I don't need one on my phone. 
[01:14:00]  Like next to your service bars, it says AT&T, right?  Yeah.  That's normal.  Not Sam is what mine says.  Yours says not Sam?  That's right.  People say, what service do you have?  Just, no, not Sam.  Don't worry about it.  You can customize your whole phone to make it say and look whatever way you want it to look.  My shit looks like a vending machine.  First of all, the way...  I see your abs and stuff.  It's so fresh.  It looks like one of those vending machines.  I can't have that.  I'd eat my phone.  I'm not really feeling it, though, still.  It sounds like they're just kind of some graphics tricks. 
[01:14:30]  And...  All right, cool.  I could look.  You could see this.  Big deal.  What's the big selling point of jailbreaking?  You can unlock it, too.  And then you could tell people that you jailbroke your phone, and then you could sound just as  cool as Bobby and Sam.  Is that the real thing here?  It's like, yeah, jailbroke it, man.  Next time I'm in a hotel with a laptop, and they say, oh, this is how much it costs for  Wi-Fi.  I'll say, no, thank you.  I'll just turn on MyWi 4.0 and use the 3G service on the phone as a Wi-Fi hotspot. 
[01:15:00]  So now your phone itself can become a Wi-Fi hotspot.  That's right.  Where if I have my laptop here and pull up networks that are all over the place, it'll  show, what, Sam's phone?  Yep.  And then I click on that, and I will use your 3G.  That's right.  Right.  Now, what about the data transfer charge?  Anything?  Data's unlimited.  Unlimited data.  And when you have that app, the 3G, it tricks, when you go to YouTube videos, your phone 
[01:15:30]  knows it's on 3G, okay, on the cell line.  Yeah.  So it will give you the shitty version of the YouTube video.  But now it's going to trick it to think it's on Wi-Fi.  That's right.  So you always get the best version of YouTube.  So it sits there buffering for fucking 20 minutes.  Or you could do FaceTime over 3G.  Now that, okay, all right.  You've got to be in good 3G service.  Or you can use your phone outside of the country.  Just pop a SIM card in it. 
[01:16:00]  Go and get a SIM card wherever you are.  What am I, fleeing?  I got my Wi-Fi on.  I'm the lamb.  Where am I going?  I got my Wi-Fi on right now.  You're just a dirty American.  Exactly.  I'm not going anywhere except my house.  Take me home.  I don't know.  Oh, wow.  That's scary.  Whoever wants to try to tap in.  I mean, of course, I have my password.  It's password protected right now.  But Sam Roberts' iPhone is a Wi-Fi network in this studio.  Right now.  Right now.  That's right.  So are you saying that I could take my phone or my computer and use your connection? 
[01:16:30]  Mm-hmm.  Sure.  Why would I ever do that when I just have my phone in the first place?  You're not kidding me, Danny.  I do everything on my phone.  I don't even need a computer.  When I go travel now, I don't bring my laptop.  That's silly things.  No, I bring a laptop.  I do work.  I need to.  I'm a professional.  Oh, shit.  He just needs to what?  I need to face you.  Go to wrestling message boards.  I could do that on my phone.  Face you.  Plug in the voice recorder.  Sam, TMZ is on your phone also.  Oh, my God. 
[01:17:00]  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  I want to go to Mike in Boston.  He's got something just imperative here that needs to be on the air.  I love our callers.  Mike from Boston.  Please.  What?  What's up, man?  What's up, Bobby?  Hi.  Hi.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, listen.  I'm just talking.  I just want to jump in.  I have a jailbroken iPhone.  And I would have the phone even if it wasn't jailbroken.  But the best part about jailbreaking is you can customize it and make it a little bit easier for yourself.  I have an app called Infinidosh that allows me to put multiple apps on the dock on the bottom. 
[01:17:30]  So I have to flip through all those pages.  Boom.  And I have a 3G app.  And I have multitasking already involved with the 3.0 software, not the 4.0 software.  And I'm more interested in the 4G phone.  Do callers really add anything to the show?  I just, I really want to.  He said who you're talking to.  Hey, thanks, Mike. 
[01:18:00]  No problem, boys.  I just.  Glad we got to the bottom of that.  Yeah, I don't.  Anthony from Connecticut has something to add about jailbroken phone.  Because the biggest criticism about yesterday's show was, hey, Anthony, we want phone calls.  Actually, people said, thank God you didn't take any phone calls.  So that's why I'm taking them now, just to annoy those people.  Hi, Anthony from Connecticut.  Hey, what do you got for the O&A show? 
[01:18:30]  Do-do-do-do, boys.  Hmm?  That's all I got.  Fucking Christ.  See, this, I just, I'm proving a point.  I'm proving a fucking point.  Dave from Connecticut.  Dave, Dave, how you doing?  What do you got for the show?  I'm doing great, Anthony.  How are you?  Fine and dandy, Dave. 
[01:19:00]  Excellent.  How about a Back to the Future theme for your iPhone?  You jailbreak it, you can make it look like Back to the Future.  Look at that.  Back to the Future phone.  Like on the slider?  Yeah.  Instead of a little thing that you just put, what if it's a DeLorean that you just put your finger on, slide it across.  Now your phone's unlocked and there's a DeLorean that just moved.  And what about that?  So it sounds to me like jailbreaking lets you Puerto Rican your phone out.  I mean, I don't want to get racial.  This is like the iPhone equivalent of like hubcap spinners. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, this is a Celica with gold spray-painted rims.  And there is also a package called, I think it's called install-less or install-us or something.  This one is illegal.  But can you hang a CD off the phone?  It allows you to download any app in the actual app store for free.  That's stealing.  That sounds a little illegal.  I don't think that's Apple fucking certified.  That's illegal. 
[01:20:00]  How about this?  How about this?  Well, you know your screen, how you have to slide through all those screens, even though they have folders now?  Yeah, I love the folders.  Okay, now you can push the home button and it shrinks all your pages onto one screen and then you can hit it.  Wow.  So that one screen.  You don't have to scroll through anything.  This doesn't sound like, I mean, the Wi-Fi thing may be in certain circumstances.  I like the FaceTime through 3G, although I wonder what the quality is.  Oh, I got this. 
[01:20:30]  You can use this.  You can actually put your credit card and use this as a credit card so you don't have to carry your wallet.  You can just scan your iPhone over it.  I saw that that's going to be soon.  I'm kidding.  Not yet.  All right, whatever.  But I did see that.  That's going to be soon.  Did you see what fucking Citibank is doing?  I saw the commercial for that motherfucking thing where if you have a check that you want deposited in your account.  I already have that.  Shut it.  What?  What is it?  Chase does it.  Yeah.  What is it?  You don't have to go there.  You got a check, right?  Maybe you got paid like $100 for some comedy gig that you did. 
[01:21:00]  I like that you're doing a commercial.  All you got to do is you take a picture of the front and back of your check and then boom, it's deposited in your checking account.  Wow, that's crazy.  Isn't that fucking crazy?  Now, I was thinking when I saw that commercial, can't you in essence do this?  Take a picture of the front and back of a check that you're sending to somebody, not the bank.  Like, you got to pay somebody and then you send it to them and then they take it and deposit it into the bank through their phone. 
[01:21:30]  Now, you've just paid somebody like there's no need for paper, a paper check to be traveling around anymore.  You could just transfer it to another person who then can transfer it to the bank.  I've had I've had the same checks since I opened my account.  Like, I don't think anybody really uses paper checks anymore in the first place.  I do sometimes.  I know, but I think the only thing I actually pay with a check is my my rent check.  I think when you use a paper check, you're buying milk. 
[01:22:00]  No, yeah, milk.  I when I have certain bills that have to be paid that aren't in my computer and I'd instead of just it's a one time deal walking out with a checkbook.  So instead of fucking mall.  No, no, no.  It's at home.  Just, you know, filling out checks for certain bills that I don't want to put on my phone.  Shit like that.  Right.  Because it's a one time deal.  Right.  One time deal, Wade.  Listen to me.  Go see Bill Deal.  And then Northwest Federal.  You ever get tired of a picture of your check? 
[01:22:30]  No, he's not at Northwestern.  Don't you get sick of this font on the iPhone?  I just it hurts my eyes.  Luckily, I got font swap.  So it's no problem.  Dude, I can totally.  Can I get Comic Sans?  Yeah, you could.  What about Comic Sans?  What about Papyrus, though?  Let me tell you something.  Any font you could imagine, it's available.  Yeah.  Helvetica?  Yeah.  Oh, Helvetica.  You could get Zap Dingbats.  Let's run through every font.  Zap Dingbats.  Yeah.  Ding, dingbats.  Yeah.  Anything.  Those are useless.  You can change all your fonts.  Unless you're canceling people on SoundTalk. 
[01:23:00]  And in your emails, too.  So anything you read is the font of your choosing.  That's right.  How about just fucking letters?  The font that the man chose for you.  Oh, is that it?  It makes you feel like you're just not fucking kowtowing to the man.  Well, this is the thing of that, the Evo and all those other phones that you can customize  your fucking phone and you can't do it.  Apple makes you have, everybody has the same icons.  Everybody has the same text.  Everybody has the same fucking iPhone.  There's nothing personal about it. 
[01:23:30]  Now, I mean, now you can change all that and make the phone that you want and show your  personality through your phone.  So you can literally have an upside down cross on your phone.  My pictures.  Through my pictures, I show my personality.  Degenerate.  The first app I got was that one that locks your pictures up under a password.  Because, wow.  Show me one picture.  I don't want to see one photo on your phone.  I don't want to see one picture.  One photo that will fucking back up why you need a password protection. 
[01:24:00]  Okay.  Let me go to my little vault.  Don't show me anything I have to lie in court about.  No, no, no, no.  It's nothing like that.  Silly.  You silly.  Where do I have it?  Oh, it's under photography.  And then there's the vault.  You're taking a course at a community college after the show?  Yes.  Oh, God.  Just, no, cancel.  I don't want to fucking network.  I hate when the network pops up.  You want to use my network?  No.  Say it on your iPhone?  God damn it, you motherfucker. 
[01:24:30]  Okay.  Eh, eh, eh, eh.  All right.  We'll go there.  And now we'll scroll down a little.  Hold on.  Oh, jeez.  What a degenerate I am.  This is terrible.  Oh, God.  You're really winning this Android argument for people.  No, no.  I'm looking through my pictures.  And they're just...  There's a million photos of little girls.  No, they're not, you fucking asshole.  What are they, women?  Yeah.  Are they women or girls?  Yeah, no, no.  That's a good...  This is one of my favorites. 
[01:25:00]  Right?  I fucking hate my life.  I fucking hate my life.  Isn't that a good one?  Did you take that?  What?  Did you take that?  No, no.  That was sent to me, though.  Oh.  I was going to say, that should be the iPhone camera ad.  Oh, it's fantastic.  Did you notice that every FaceTime commercial for the iPhone is literally fucking...  Someone's going to show their cunt on the thing.  What?  I know.  I saw, like, a black guy and his son, and the black guy was showing his new baby to his 
[01:25:30]  grandfather.  Yeah, I noticed that all the FaceTime ads on TV are all about...  Sexual.  No, they're not sexual.  They're just about having kids.  It's like, oh, like, finding out that you're going to be a father on FaceTime.  Yeah, but...  Because it's two separate, like, giving birth.  Like, oh, going to be a dad commercial.  Yeah, yeah.  Going to be a dad.  Yeah, but if you look at some of them, though, it's like, the girl's like, he's like, come  on, just show me.  And she's like, I can't.  And, okay, it's...  The beginning starts out like, just show me.  I want to see it.  And then the girl will be like, all right.  And then she opens her mouth, and she has fucking braces. 
[01:26:00]  But it's like, maybe it's just my creepy mind that is like...  I think you're beautiful.  Thank you, Daddy.  Don't call me that.  You got another one you're going to show me?  No, no.  That's it?  I was just looking at something.  I'll show you later.  It's great.  It's his own cockpits.  Yeah, it's Jimmy's balls from earlier.  I saved it.  You can never bring your iPhone to Apple.  Oh, no.  I'd have to...  No.  Because they can...  They'll crack that fucking code in two seconds. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, believe me.  They'll fucking crack it.  They'll look in it.  They'll fucking post everything online.  That SS...  They'll go right into your SSH and fucking look at...  What?  What the fuck is that?  That's when you can hook your iPhone up to your computer and literally go inside of your iPhone.  Yeah.  And see everything.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It brings up a screen.  I don't need that.  And you can move shit around.  You can't fuck...  Unless you know what you're doing, you don't fuck with that shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've done it.  And you...  We have the option.  We have the option of SSH-ing. 
[01:27:00]  Ooh.  Well, good for you.  I don't...  Well, you know something?  After all said and done here, you haven't sold me on jailbreaking my phone because...  Why don't you just try it and then unjailbreak it later?  Don't want to fuck around with it.  Oh.  I am a regular iPhone guy.  You know what?  You've actually convinced me to unjailbreak my phone.  There's nothing going on there.  I'm taking it off.  There's nothing going on there that is so exciting that I need to...  This is what happens with jailbreaking is you do it and you go ballistic on fucking  free, crazy apps and you buy them all and then a month later, you're going to be like, 
[01:27:30]  eh, fuck this.  Yeah.  We're both going to be back to it right now.  It's just something to fill the hole of loneliness when you're alone on a train or you're driving  somewhere.  It's just...  It's like literally like a game.  Jailbreaking your iPhone is like a new game where you can just fucking change your font.  Instead of slide to turn on, it says fuck off.  But you do that with your regular phone that isn't jailbroken either.  I noticed yesterday, I spent the entire day taking my phone in and out of my pocket. 
[01:28:00]  Like the second you put your phone away, you're like, boop, it comes right back out of your  pocket and you're just doing something else with it.  If you had the finger, the finger thing.  You own your finger thing.  Pull it out like a ripcord.  It's also the section option.  I hope it breaks.  That's the second option of the Bob Kelly finger ring.  It's not the Bob Kelly finger ring.  That's the...  Apparently, it's the Nigerian down the streets finger ring that he's selling.  All right.  Enough about your fucking jailbroken iPhones. 
[01:28:30]  I want to take some calls.  Okay.  I want to take some calls.  Matt from Jersey has something very interesting to say.  Matt?  Yes.  Hi.  How are you today?  I'm great.  How are you?  Great.  Great.  Hey, so to the thing where the cell phone takes pictures of the checks now and they can  send it out for a deposit.  Yeah.  A lot of banks have been doing that.  It's called remote capture.  So like if you go into a bank and make a deposit, all those deposits and checks are scanned and 
[01:29:00]  then sent to Fidelity or whoever processes them.  And like, say, God forbid, if you see that a check didn't get deposited in your account,  you go right to the branch and all of your checks are there and they could rerun it.  Yeah.  You're talking about the banks scanning stuff, not you taking a picture with your camera  phone and fucking sending it.  But it's the same thing.  The banks are just taking...  Yeah.  I know the banks have been scanning shit for years.  I know.  You're doing it at your house now.  I get a fucking statement and it shows all of my checks scanned. 
[01:29:30]  I don't get my physical checks back.  They're all scanned.  What are you talking about?  We're talking about apples and you're talking oranges, Matt.  Good day.  Good day.  You know, you can deposit a check at the ATM now.  You know, you don't even need the envelope anymore.  Dude, you don't even need your phone, your camera on your phone.  You can just go to Best Buy.  You can get a...  They actually have cameras.  They have cameras.  They have digital cameras.  I can't make a picture of those.  Dude, when I went to the bank, I brought my passbook and they don't even type the amount  of deposit anymore in your passbook. 
[01:30:00]  All right, ancient banking guy.  See, that's a caller that's just like, what is he saying?  He said he had something to add about the scanning thing.  And then you go to it and it's that.  I love that you hate them.  Oh, I hate them.  It's once in a fucking thousand calls that I have any use for these motherfuckers.  Well, phones are lit.  I mean...  I know.  There's got to be a wealth of just interesting...  Oh, God damn.  There's got to be some... 
[01:30:30]  Somebody has something to do.  All right, someone does.  How about we go to Mark in Philly?  Mark in Philly.  Mark, how are you?  How's Philly?  Philly's doing well today, Anthony.  How are you and Bobby doing without Opie?  Great.  Having fun.  Hanging out.  What do you got?  Question for Tech Talk with Bobby.  I heard you can now use any service, not just AT&T, if you jailbreak your phone. 
[01:31:00]  Is that correct?  That is correct, but you need a SIM card from that provider.  You can use Verizon.  So how can you put a SIM card in your fucking iPhone?  Get a fucking Verizon SIM card.  There's a SIM card in there.  There's a SIM card, yeah.  Hold the phone, though.  You have to now open up your fucking iPhone?  No, you just...  It doesn't pop that hard.  Yeah, you just pop it out.  You pop the SIM card out.  Oh.  What the fuck?  You can dismantle a 50 cal and put it back together in 30 seconds, and you're worried 
[01:31:30]  about fucking taking an iPhone apart.  Yeah, because the second you take it apart...  You push with a fucking paperclip.  Oh, my God.  Now you're shoving paperclips in holes on the phone.  It comes with a paperclip.  I hope springs and tubes come out.  You push in here.  The SIM card comes out.  You put the other SIM card in.  Where does the SIM card come out?  It comes out right this little...  See that slot?  That tray comes out.  That tray.  It comes out.  You can put the SIM card in, and you can actually cut a SIM card, a regular Verizon 
[01:32:00]  big SIM card.  These are mini SIMs, but you can get a Verizon big SIM card, and you can literally cut it  in a certain way to make it a mini one, and then stick that in, and you can have Verizon  on your phone.  What?  What?  What?  Look at you, hacker.  What?  What?  What?  Bob, you can't have Verizon on your iPhone.  Dude, they don't know that.  Dude, it's not compatible.  It's not compatible.  It's not compatible.  You fucking bearded lesbian.  It's not compatible.  Thanks, Mark.  Travis is right on that one.  I know.  He's right on that.  I was lying. 
[01:32:30]  You can get T-Mobile.  T-Mobile.  That's it.  Yeah, you can use T-Mobile.  T-Mobile.  T-Mobile.  Or you can use Rogers or Orange.  I don't care.  Yeah, I want to get a Rogers phone.  You can get Rogers or Orange.  You can't get that in the U.S. unless you jailbreak.  I used my jailbroken phone in Iraq.  What?  What?  Who were you calling?  I called.  You were able to call here from Iraq with that phone?  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  How come people don't fucking...  Dude, I was in Afghanistan in the fucking middle of the battlefield.  They do.  I've never heard one of those calls. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  Liar, liar, pants of flame.  They don't record them, but they do it.  I don't...  Somebody would record a battlefield fucking phone call.  Dude, I have one right here.  They'd be up on fucking...  It'd be up on YouTube or something.  Dude, I have a battlefield phone call in here from someone who called me.  I'll play it for you right now.  Jesus Christ, dude.  Will you?  Just settle down.  Hang on.  Let me push the button.  All right.  There's a battlefield phone call.  Here we go.  Maybe they're busy battling.  Here we go.  Ready?  Yeah.  Hey, who's this?  Dude, help me, man. 
[01:33:30]  All right.  All right.  Shut the fuck up.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Wow, this is close combat.  How old are you?  How old are you?  Dude, I just like the fact that as Bobby is doing that, he's holding the phone up to the  microphone.  Yeah, yeah.  To make it more visually appealing to us.  I'm not trying to fool the fucking listeners.  I'm trying to fool you in the studio.  It didn't really work.  If it doesn't work with you, dummy, it's not going to work with them. 
[01:34:00]  Enough about your goddamn jailbroken iPhones.  It didn't sell me.  Fucking jailbreak it.  All I want to say.  Just jailbreak it.  It didn't sell me.  If you go to the website, you'll want to do it.  No, you won't.  All I know is I want to keep it a little.  You have a big, huge cock.  I want to keep it a little.  I want to go a little local right now, but with a national twist to it.  Whoa.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  As we all know, at the Meadowlands, they had the auditions for American Idol. 
[01:34:30]  And this year, wow.  Exactly like last year.  And the year before.  And the year before that.  And the year before that.  I love how the news stations pick up on it and just play the same fucking stuff.  People singing poorly online.  The crying people.  The people that you know will never get in.  But I saw some on the news this morning and had to, had to request some of this singing from American Idol. 
[01:35:00]  So here are some of the people, I guess, that were standing on line.  And the news loves trolling the line for people and getting them to sing.  So here are some people auditioning yesterday for American Idol.  Uncertainty about who will be on this year's judging panel didn't seem to phase the thousands of American Idol hopefuls.  They still want to be on that show.  Of course they do.  Well, they lined up outside the ISAD Center in the Meadowlands for the New York area auditions. 
[01:35:30]  Our Fox 5's Ann Craig checked out some of the talent.  Visions of me with you on the time.  Every time I close my eyes.  Every time I close my eyes.  I see my name in shining light.  Did you ever know that you're my hero?  Oh, shut the fuck up.  They make it. 
[01:36:00]  But I've watched that clip since American Idol started.  It's the same clip.  They grab people that can't sing and make them sing.  That's funny.  And it's just, is it supposed to be funny?  Yeah.  And it's these, these people that think they, do they think they have a chance?  They do.  It's, it's infuriating to watch.  And I'm tired of it.  I'm sick of the song.  I'm sick of fucking Seacrest. 
[01:36:30]  I could give a shit who they get to replace, uh, uh, Simon.  Might be Steven Tyler.  Ellen's gone too.  Who cares?  And Terry DeGord.  All of them are gone.  Except no, Randy Jackson's staying.  Well, thank God.  The dog.  Dog.  Dog pounding the house.  Uh, by the way, Ellen is leaving.  And, and what they said is because she doesn't have it in her to criticize people and be mean  to people and criticize their, their shortcomings about, uh, their, their singing and performing  when the truth of the matter is the ratings dropped. 
[01:37:00]  She wasn't fucking pulling them in and she's gone.  She was horrible.  It's like, yeah, she was horrible in that show.  And I, I only saw clips.  I like how they had, I refuse to watch the show anymore.  I like, they had to cover her neck.  Like after the first episode, they just, they had to, she had to, they put a scarf around  it.  They started covering it up cause it was on, on HD, her neck.  She was a fucking 90 year old woman neck.  You know what happens?  And this is why when you're eating pussy, it stretches your neck. 
[01:37:30]  Think how bad your neck feels the next day.  You ever eat pussy for like fucking like an hour.  And, and, and no, no, fuck them.  I've never done that.  I'll take a couple of swipes and then I stick my cock in their mouth.  You need a couple of swipes.  You need, you need a neck brace the next day, but it'll stretch the skin out.  So that's probably why she has that warbly Turkey neck.  You've never eaten pussy for that long. 
[01:38:00]  No, I, I, I like, look, I, I hated eating pussy when I first started.  It was fucking, you know, it tastes like a fine fucking brandy.  Oh my God.  It was terrible.  And then I finally got into eating pussy.  Uh, I started getting into liking eating pussy cause I thought I didn't even know about  the clitoris.  I was just eating the, like licking the whole, just the big, you know what I mean?  My tongue, my chin was in it.  I didn't know how to eat pussy.  My whole face, my nose was on the clitoris and my tongue.  I'm trying to get inside and find her G spot with my tongue. 
[01:38:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  It was just a mess.  There's no one to really teach you that is there?  Well, actually Jimmy Norton.  Oh, fucking gave me a couple of great tips.  It got to the point where you were old enough where you knew Jimmy at the time.  Well, no, I already, I learned how to eat pussy before that, but Jimmy gave me some great  Jimmy's fucking got this little tongue thing.  He told me about this little tongue thing that he does.  And it fucking works. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  You have to, cause you know, I, you know, the fucking clit is this crazy, crazy fucking  nugget that's on a chick's pussy that, and they're all different clits.  I mean, some girls like the left side of the clit rubbed and some girls like it hard.  Some girls, you have to be very, like you can't go from one clit to another clit and just  use the same technique.  Like you have to, you know, I have to adjust and you have to adjust.  Yeah.  But Jimmy had this little thing that works pretty much across the board of, it's like 
[01:39:30]  a skeleton key for clits.  Yeah.  Where you kind of bury your nose on the bone, the, the fucking twat bone, whatever that bone  is.  The pubis.  Yeah.  The pubis.  The pubis bone.  Where the bush fat lies.  Right.  Right.  Exactly.  And then you, uh, get the clit and it doesn't hurt your jaw.  Cause that was my thing is I would, I would take such big swipes.  Like I was a fat kid eating ice cream.  And then I, you know, but it's, it, this actually saved my jaw muscle from going, you 
[01:40:00]  don't have to use your jaw.  You know, it's more.  Yeah.  It's the tongue.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, uh, you just swipe it really soft and gentle.  And then, and then I always go sideways.  I'll go up and down and then I'll go sideways.  You can't break the rhythm though.  When they're ready to blast off.  I can't break the rhythm or look at them or speak.  Yeah.  Cause if you, if you break the rhythm, uh, that, that fucks them up. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  If they're ready to let loose, you got to keep the, the, the, the little.  You got to keep that going.  Yeah.  Cause, cause I didn't know that going swirly, swirly round and round after going the back  and forth, right.  When she's ready to go, it'll be like, ah, why'd you do that?  Yeah.  It's like most chicks need a constant rhythm.  Suck at jerking off.  Like they fuck.  It's very rare.  You get a chick that because you have to, you have to be looking down at a cock and coming  from this angle to be able to get a fucking good. 
[01:41:00]  And they don't understand that you, you have to have, you have to take that skin and you have  to go over the helmet and back down the helmet.  You can't like most girls would just jerk your shaft off.  Like that.  You're fucking the base of your cock is it.  That does nothing.  The helmet is where you get the, the jismotic fluid action pumping.  And you gotta, you gotta, it's like asparagus.  The, the tip is always better than the base.  Yeah.  You, I, there should be a course on jerking off. 
[01:41:30]  I wish chicks would just learn how to jerk off.  Like I like when you get a blow job and they do the, the twist, the two handed twist.  Two handy twisty.  And they go over the helmet.  They kind of just come off the cock.  But, but a straight handy.  Um.  It just sucks.  Very rare that you find somebody that can give you the straight handy.  Now it's either too hard or they don't go up over the helmet.  Oh, I see a suitcase coming in.  Oh, look who's here.  It's Jimmy Norton.  He's home.  Doom to do. 
[01:42:00]  Jimmy's here.  Are you sleepy and cranky?  Really?  Oh, no.  You're cranky?  We were just talking about how, um, how you, you pretty much taught Bobby Kelly how to eat pussy.  No, no, no, no.  He gave me good pointers.  He advanced me to the, I'm, I was a purple belt.  He, he made me a brown belt.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, so you lick ass too.  Is that what that means?  I'm not a black belt.  I'm not a black belt with three brown stripes on it.  Looks like a wallet.  Yeah, we call it belt to you, right?  Oh, fuck.  Oh, Jesus.  We get an insta-chip. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, fuck.  The show instantly gets better.  Jimmy.  Uh, what, what happened?  Why are you cranky?  I'm just tired from flying and the plane was an hour late.  It was an hour late?  Yeah, I should have been here a while.  I don't want to read your tweets.  That's terrible.  There was nothing about the plane.  No?  The fat pig that stepped on my foot getting off the plane.  Well, what happened?  Big fat lady stepped on my foot with a flat ass.  Trying to get her, uh, her little carry-on out?  No, just lumbering like a fucking fat ox.  I hope she's dead. 
[01:43:00]  I hope she's in the airport dead.  All fat chicks do have-  Why does the fat not go into their ass?  It's just a fat hips and just a flat-  All the flat ass is one of the worst asses ever.  It goes from-  Oh, you got a picture?  It goes from the knee to the fucking bra.  Jimmy took a picture of her ass.  And she's wearing the definitive mom jeans.  Yeah.  Like, those are the mom jeans where the ass is just flat, non-existent.  Oh, what a horrid ass.  I know. 
[01:43:30]  You see her fucking side blubber, too?  She's enraging.  She's enraging.  Oh, look at this fucking-  Yeah, there's the side fucking fat.  Look at this fatso I had to sit next to on a fucking umbrella.  Oh, God.  Look at that.  That's bad.  That's my arm under his fat arm.  Ugh.  Ew.  Look at that fucking mess.  How annoying is that?  What?  Just don't fly.  I believe he's playing a picture of you, too.  He's showing someone right now.  But the funny thing is, I was trying to take the picture when fatso was sleeping, and I  had the flash and the sound on. 
[01:44:00]  So I went, phoomp.  This guy went, he actually shook.  He was like, what the fuck was that?  Shit.  So how were the gigs?  They were good.  I just did something with David Tell for his show on Showtime.  We watched porn and talked about it.  Yeah.  Yeah, we did the-  That sounds cool.  It was good.  We did the tribute to Seika.  Dave's good.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Tribute to Seika?  Yeah.  She was lovely.  In her day, she was quite the porn star.  A little older now.  She came out.  She was there.  A little older. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, but she's still big, fat tits.  Yeah.  I'd have to suck them.  Would you really, though?  Yeah, I really would.  Yeah.  Just to do it.  Just to do it.  Just to say I did it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, nice.  Jimmy, you taught me how to-  I was telling him that you advanced my pussy-eating techniques with that little-  Oh, the tongue, yeah.  How does it-  Yeah.  That's it.  How did you do it?  I went-  No, that's fine.  Yeah, that's fine, but I didn't-  You add the-  It's a flick.  See, what Bob would do is flop his tongue up and down, like paint the fence, but quicker. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  And what you got to do is kind of line it up under your tongue.  So it's kind of like darts back and forth on the clench.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You need a little-  Yeah, I told him.  I used to lick the big hole instead of the little one.  That's crazy.  I used to put my face in the pussy and just-  And then my tongue would go-  Like a St. Bernard drinking water.  It's a giant nasty tongue laughing away.  Come up with a pool of green fucking mooky stuff on my tongue and have to spit it out 
[01:45:30]  every swipe.  It's horrible.  Who are you with?  Who has green shit in their pussy?  You're in bed.  Visit the emergency room.  I know.  Maybe a cow is chewing grass and spitting in her box.  I'm tired.  Dude, fucking-  I've been sucking.  I never-  I'm fucking wake up at six.  This is fucking unheard of.  Have you been bombing all day?  No, I'm not bombing.  I'm just fucking mediocre.  Yesterday's show was so funny.  My heart was great.  Oh, my God.  We had a blast.  I was fucking laughing.  Well, we were talking about Lady Gaga and her bullshit down there in Arizona. 
[01:46:00]  That whole, you know, thing.  Patrice.  Patrice just-  You can't even describe what he was doing.  He was fucking doing the song, but just making it-  But he was doing this thing, this weird thing.  He was doing an intro to the song.  He was going, bop, bop, skoom, doom, doom, bop, skoom, gop, gop, gop.  It was fucking ridiculous.  It was fucking the funniest thing I've ever heard.  It was really fucking funny, man. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, fucking for a half hour they were doing this shit.  And DeRosa was great, too.  Oh, was he good?  Yeah, we had a really good time.  Yeah, DeRosa was funny.  And now this morning we've just been bullshitting about everything.  Stupid fucking jailbroken iPhone and prostitution.  Talked a little bit about massages and the backwards milking technique.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, like it's an animal's tail and she's pulled on it.  You know, when they go on at the end, they'll kind of reach under and you bring your butt up a little bit. 
[01:47:00]  But I usually get on all fours and arch my back like I'm about to take it in the ass.  And I did it one time and I actually hurt my back.  I pulled a muscle in my back trying to get her to finger fuck.  At a massage, he pulled a muscle in his back.  I walked out just limping.  That's wonderful.  With a wet spot on my jeans.  You try to make noise like when they're going, oh, there's a little video of it.  That's nice.  It's like happy typing girl.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Wow.  What a nice milking that is.  Isn't that great?  God, that looks like it's fucking fun to do. 
[01:47:30]  Lucky girl.  What a plain Jane this one is.  She's actually a close up.  She doesn't look like happy typing.  Yeah, that's what I was saying.  Like earlier when we were watching this, I was like, yeah, she's kind of just a plain girl.  Yeah.  Knows how to give a fucking good handy.  She's having fucking pig's blood dumped on her.  As she's the queen.  Yeah.  Fucking witch hands.  Queen of the prom.  Yeah.  We were watching that.  But girls apparently don't give good handies.  No.  It's like you can make yourself fucking get yourself off in two seconds if you need to by jacking. 
[01:48:00]  But girls just can't get that rhythm down, I guess.  The stroke isn't right.  It's like a fucking car with the, when you shut it off and it keeps running.  Yeah.  They just can't get the stroke going.  Yeah, they got fucking eight rings on from Spencer's gifts.  Fucking shredding your cock.  Yeah, take the rings off.  You don't need that pinch.  They go really fast and then they shift hands.  It's like you were just starting to get it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a job. 
[01:48:30]  It's fucking, it's a hand job.  And you really got to work.  You got to put some elbow grease into it.  You can't stop.  It's amazing how you advance yourself.  Like I remember I used to have to jerk off with Vaseline or all the, now I get.  You wanted to more so than just the dry jack.  But you could do the dry jack too, like right from the beginning, right?  Oh, no, no, no.  Really?  No, not on myself.  You can't dry jack?  On who then?  Who were you?  I'm kidding.  Fucking both of you guys didn't pick up.  I know. 
[01:49:00]  Literal Anthony.  I dry jack.  Now I can fucking jerk off with two fingers and my thumb.  I can literally just two seconds and I'm done.  But I still have to lock my legs, you know, like when I'm standing up.  But yeah.  What is it with leg and ass muscles that are essential with jerking off?  I think it focuses you just when you need that.  Your body, I just tense up.  So you're fucking, you're focusing on one thing.  Christ's legs are more relaxed during the crucifixion than mine on when I'm fucking shooting. 
[01:49:30]  My girl always giggle because she knows I'm about to come because my body just becomes wood.  Doesn't that just take you right out of it though?  You don't want to hear a giggle?  No.  Yeah?  No, I'm used to it.  No, I hate giggles.  I don't know.  I don't give a fuck.  I don't need that.  Like there's sometimes it's like.  Have you seen my cock?  No.  Thank God.  I've heard.  Really?  No, I haven't.  I saw Jimmy's balls though. 
[01:50:00]  What a great picture.  Oh, you got the photo?  What a great photo you sent me.  Thank you.  Holy shit.  Just this fucking nutsack hanging down.  Yeah, my bag looked good.  My bag is normally very small and tight and wasp nest-ish.  It must have been warm because it was very caffy-like.  That was my L.A. bag.  My New York bag is decidedly smaller.  Wonderful.  Well, Jimmy's here.  We got Otto showing up at, I guess, 8.30. 
[01:50:30]  Yes.  8.30 or so.  All right.  We'll take a little breakage.  Get some more phone calls, hopefully.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Because they've just offered so much today.  Have they been awful, the callers?  Every one of them has sucked.  They offered nothing?  Did you just show them your bag?  Yeah.  You know what, though?  From a glance, it looked like a pussy from the side.  I thought it was a pussy.  When I first pulled it up, I was like, oh.  And then I saw it was his bag.  I didn't mean to hit the fucking video. 
[01:51:00]  I didn't mean to hit video.  Hold on.  Just look at how awful my face is.  Jesus.  What is it?  Wait, hold on.  He's got video, accidental video of him taking a picture of his nuts.  Yeah, I think it's video.  See, look at how awful my fucking face looks.  Oh, God, you look like a killer.  That's fucking funny.  You want to pixelate your pud and post that. 
[01:51:30]  That is hysterical.  Your face looks really disturbing.  I was trying to take a photo of my bag, and I just hit the wrong button.  It's so intense.  I wasn't in a bad mood.  I laughed about it later.  That's fucking great.  You look creepy.  Who called so far that was awful?  Oh, whoever from whoever, wherever.  It's just reiterating what had already been said.  I love that one.  Yeah, Bobby was talking about jailbreaking the phone. 
[01:52:00]  You know, I did that, too, and it's cool.  Thanks.  I'm un-jailbreaking my phone right now.  Are you really?  Fuck it, yeah.  Why are you not jailbreaking it?  It's illegal now.  It's fine.  I'm un-jailbreaking it.  Why?  You don't answer why.  I just want to go against Sam.  You're just going to jailbreak it again when you get home.  You know you're going to just jailbreak it again.  I just un-jailbreak it.  How do you un-jailbreak it?  You can't.  You didn't.  You've got to plug it into your computer and restore from a backup.  He's lying. 
[01:52:30]  Wonderful.  Jimmy's home.  He's back.  He's back with a vengeance.  It's a plane fart.  Good news is, a few job openings in the beer factory.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, wow.  Ooh, he was a little angry.  I didn't really, I don't know.  Well, the family's response was a little cold.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're kind of just defending.  It was all racially motivated.  The guy racially motivated. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, this is a guy in Connecticut, worked at a beer distributor, went in there, shot up,  how many people was it?  Eight or dead.  Nine, something like that.  And himself, yeah, shot himself.  You don't see black guys doing that very often.  That's usually a white guy crime.  No, that's usually a white guy.  Anyway, but he said it was racial because he had been a victim of racism in the workplace.  But there have been no complaints.  The union never heard about it.  His supervisors never heard about it.  It was never brought to him. 
[01:53:30]  And the family is like, well, let's not, you know, rush to judgment.  Let's look and see what the whole situation was.  Situation was your crazy fucking relative burst into a place and shot a bunch of people he worked with.  They had a video of him stealing beer.  And when they showed him the video and told him to quit or be fired, that's when he opened, he picked him up.  Yeah, yeah, there was a complaint of theft against him.  And they were going to, yeah, fire him.  And he came in and decided to shoot a supervisor and a bunch of other people. 
[01:54:00]  And the family just, you know, well, I heard there were things drawn on the walls.  Shut the fuck up.  Exactly.  You got a lunatic fucking thieving asshole relative who decides to shoot up his workplace.  Always make excuses.  Shut up.  Take responsibility.  Fucker.  We'll get into that next.  After these words.  Oh, we're rocking. 
[01:54:30]  Between screams that this day can be gone.  Oh.  Even sinners must scream.  And I can be the one.  Oh.  Oh.  Don't cry.  Yeah.  Oh, heaven and hell.  Holy shit.  Sounds fucking good.  Yeah, it's a new one.  Yeah. 
[01:55:00]  Hi, everybody.  Opie and Anthony show.  Well, Jimmy's here.  Jimmy's back.  Yes, I am.  From his travels.  Yay.  His world travels.  We are also joined by Robert Kelly.  Yes.  The lovely Robert Kelly.  Who was, oh, yes, Kenny wants to say something.  Well, speaking of traveling, Jim has to go somewhere tomorrow, too.  Oh, where is Jim going tomorrow?  I'll be in Tampa tomorrow through Sunday.  Tampa tomorrow through Sunday.  Then I'm back for a while.  At the Tampa Improv. 
[01:55:30]  Not Sunday, Saturday.  I mean Saturday.  Oh, he got mad at you.  Yeah.  He's tired.  He says the same thing about you.  I'm just tired.  And also joined by the wonderful Otto.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  From the comedy team of Otto and George.  Thank you.  I'm glad you said that because, you know, a lot of people don't know who I am.  Just some schmuck with a stupid name that brought it in here.  Otto.  Yeah.  I kept an Otto in.  It's good to be back on.  Yeah.  I only seem to get called when somebody's sick lately. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, really?  Yeah.  Like a fucking doctor.  Yeah.  They call me when fucking, fucking Aunt Opie's is out.  Find a lump on your sternum so I can have a career.  Holy shit.  Fuck.  Yeah.  So, yeah, Otto's in.  Where are you going to be?  Got any plugging anything there?  Got some shows?  Yeah.  I've been juicing lately, you know, using a juice extractor and the fucking bowel movements 
[01:56:30]  that are coming out of me, man.  That's what I hear from people that use that thing.  It's like, yeah, it's great.  It's great.  And then you just shit like fucking.  I just turned 50 and, you know, and then you got to get a call.  They tell me I got to get a colonoscopy and everything.  I'm going to bring a fucking opening act for that.  I'm not going to go on first, you know.  The fucking guy that opens for me, I have a fucking camera up his ass first.  Yeah.  I hope it's given by Caligula.  Yeah.  Caligula.  Yeah.  So, this juice thing, man, I got the fucking antichrist coming out of me with these fucking 
[01:57:00]  carrot and spinach shits.  I feel I'm eating better, but I feel like shit.  I feel like I'm dying.  Does it like.  I feel great when I eat gyros and stay up until three in the morning.  You start taking care of yourself and you fucking feel like crap.  It's not.  When does the payoff come back?  Yeah.  When is it supposed to actually work?  I feel horrible.  When you juice stuff like that, it's, it's, I don't think it's made to be fucking juiced.  If you want to eat a carrot, eat fucking carrots.  It's at least got some kind of fiber to it to hold the shit together or you're just going 
[01:57:30]  to be pissing out your asshole.  Yeah.  I'm enjoying you to commiserating on how carrots aren't healthy for you.  No, they're very healthy, but not in juice form.  The shit that you're eating.  I don't know.  I mean, maybe this, it's good.  I don't know.  I think when you start making money, you think you want to live forever.  You're going to fucking die anyway.  I'm not going to get to spend it all.  Just fuck it.  Eat like shit.  I, and, and the last show I did in my forties was a fucking horrible bomb.  I, I had to go out to the Montauk fucking yacht club to perform for super blue blood, 
[01:58:00]  rich people.  Like not people like you that earned what you have, which, you know, congratulations.  Thank you, sir.  A salute.  You know.  A salute.  Yeah.  But these fucking people hated me.  I was working in a, in a giant, like a circus tent and they were serving a lox, lobster  Newberg and these fucking rich little dogs that they had running around.  Champagne.  Champagne cocktails.  Bring out the sensation peppers.  High in the Sierra mountains.  They were just one Italian in the bed.  That was no heart attack. 
[01:58:30]  All right.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  The guy that played Willie Chi Chi and Joe, Joe Spinell.  Yeah.  You know him?  Uh, he was great.  He used to come to Dangerfields.  I, I, uh, he invited me to a screening of a movie did years ago called Ida Jury.  Armand DeSante was in it.  Oh, yeah.  But yeah, I smoked pot with him.  He was great.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He got discovered.  Yeah.  He got discovered driving a taxi and, uh, the director, Sam Peckinpah, saw his fucking 
[01:59:00]  hack license and said, you look like a murderer.  You should be, they're making this gangster movie.  You should try out for it.  He got cast in The Godfather.  It looked like a murderer.  Yeah.  That's great.  He never stopped working.  Never took an acting lesson in his life.  He got discovered from his hack license.  Wow.  So, he tried out for The Godfather, got cast, worked the rest of his life.  He was in every movie in the 70s.  Yeah.  Rocky.  Rocky.  Yeah.  Gangsta movies.  Yeah.  Rocky.  Yeah.  He was amazing.  Yeah.  Damn.  Yeah.  Joe Spagnoli.  His real name is Spagnoli. 
[01:59:30]  Because his hack license looked like a fucking killer.  Yeah.  He had these fucking, he made this movie called Maniac that was really graphic.  Yeah.  It was a very graphic movie.  Well, is Pesci it?  No, no.  It's a different one.  Who was in that?  Maniac?  Oh, no, but he's just this guy going around New York fucking raping and killing women  and fucking scalping and ripping their fucking scalps off.  It's one of the bloodiest movies ever.  Sounds great.  Yeah.  So, anyway, these rich people hated me.  I mean, I just...  How long into it did you know that it was going to be bad?  I had a bad feeling the whole time I was there. 
[02:00:00]  Trish is like, let's enjoy ourselves.  There's all this free food.  You know, I had Trish there with me and I go, look, I can't enjoy myself before a show.  You know, until I get the first laugh, I feel like a fucking trespassing here, you know?  Like someone's going to go throw you out.  You know, I mean, I've been killing for fucking 30 years in clubs.  When is my confidence going to kick in, you know?  Fucking, I'm reading this book about Charlie Chaplin who was the most successful comedian ever  and his image is still known. 
[02:00:30]  And, you know, he worked fucking 90 years ago and he had this chronic fear that one day he would wake up  and just everything that worked would stop working and that he would just one day not be funny.  He had that fear his whole life after all that success.  Yeah.  I mean, the guy was making $3 million a year in 1914.  Right.  And at that time, you could buy a mansion for like 25 grand.  He was making, and he still didn't feel like, you know what I mean?  It makes sense, though. 
[02:01:00]  Just because it happened that many years ago, comics are just fucking insecure people.  Yeah, if you want to be secure, you have to become a doctor.  I don't know.  I haven't met one that isn't.  Really?  I just haven't.  Rife with fear?  Yeah.  Wait, did you have an opening act?  Oh, at that place?  No.  No.  No, I had a DJ, too.  A DJ.  Oh, it's great.  Oh, and the hostility in me was building, and by the time I went up there, I was like,  um, there was some fat fuck that had like a fucking $25 million yacht. 
[02:01:30]  Yes, I was borrowing it.  I sailed the seas.  I was screaming at them about fucking two-for-one Filet-O-Fish at McDonald's, you fucking rich  cunts.  Oh, shit.  I go, take your fucking pocket rat dogs and kick them in the fucking ocean.  I was wishing fucking blood diseases off.  Was that your opening line?  No, I'm supposed to be doing, like, entertaining them, you know?  Yeah, they probably thought, oh, a cute puppet act.  Jesus.  Otto sent me a very funny, uh, raging bull text. 
[02:02:00]  Hold on.  I think I still have it.  But I got such a kick out of it.  I was so depressed, because it was the last show of my, that decade that just ended for  me.  It was fucking, oh, it was awful.  How are you doing?  This is a text I got from Otto.  Otto, 11.37 p.m., just did a yacht club where they all hated me and all the other bullshit.  And he spelled yacht, Y-A-G-H-T.  Is that not right?  Of course it's not right.  I wouldn't have pointed it out if it was right.  What, do you think I was congratulating you? 
[02:02:30]  I was educated in Staten Island.  I went to Peruglia School.  That's great.  Hey, now, wait a minute.  Um, did anybody see that, um, the, uh, Shatner interview with Bernard Getz that was on you?  No, I didn't see that one.  He's got a new show where he's interviewing all these fucking people that went through  Hollywood.  Yeah, Shatner all of a sudden is the fucking guy to go, the go-to interview guy.  Oh, it's so great.  By the way, you had him as a guest, right?  Getz is insane.  Yeah.  He's fucking nuts.  He's the best. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, we had him in, and, uh, he, he, apparently, it was, uh, gonna run for mayor in New York,  and, uh, he, he had a pet squirrel, and it ran away, and he's talking  about vegetarianism and how that is the key to, uh, non-violence.  That's exactly what he said on the Shatner thing.  Meanwhile, Hitler was a vegetarian.  He was?  Yeah.  And it's like, oh, vegetarians are very docile and very non-violent.  Every one of those guys that he shot later, like, committed more and more felonies.  Of course they did.  Except the one in the wheelchair, because he couldn't rape anybody. 
[02:03:30]  He couldn't rape anybody.  Yeah.  Oh, Daryl Cabe.  Yeah, yeah.  Just fucking hang his dick out and roll into bitches.  I know.  They, they, they asked him for five bucks, he shot all four of them, and then the, then  the guy sues him for 40 million dollars.  Yeah.  Which is pretty stupid, because when you ask him for five, he shoots you.  So now it's fucking up for 40 million.  Stupid fucking monkey.  I like, I like that he turned around and said, oh, you don't look that bad.  Yeah, that's what got him in trouble.  And fucking shot him again.  That's what got him in trouble.  They were all lying there. 
[02:04:00]  He goes, you, he goes, you still look okay.  And then shot him again.  Yeah, yeah.  He goes, now you were starting to enjoy it.  You, you were, you were no longer threatened at that point.  Yeah, yeah.  The guy wasn't going to do anything at that point.  And then they immediately churned out another Death Wish.  If you ever check out Death Wish 3, it's so fucking bad and slapped together.  Because they, they go, we got to get a Death Wish out immediately.  Because that, that was like a hot topic.  The subway vigilante.  Yeah.  Before they found him.  Oh, Death Wish 3 is the worst and greatest movie ever made.  Because Bronson was like, I didn't, he didn't want to do it because his wife had cancer 
[02:04:30]  at the time.  Jill Ireland, right?  Yeah, Jill Ireland was dying and they go, look, we got, we're going to do it with fucking  James Colburn.  They go, look, we'll shoot it in five days.  Just, you know, come to New York, we'll give you 10 million bucks.  And you got to see it.  It's just, it's just, they show the streets of New York are just running wild with savages.  It makes no sense.  It's just, it makes no fucking sense.  Great.  I probably have it.  I don't remember it.  He gets this gun.  It's a, it's an, it's called the auto mag.  It's like, it's a dirty Harry Magnum, but it's an automatic that has a clip that's like 
[02:05:00]  this big.  And he's just fucking blowing gigantic holes in people.  Yeah.  Oh, it's great.  Hey, that's my car.  It's, it's just the fucking greatest movie.  Get away from her.  It's just a, and, and, and there's all these like nice Jewish couples living in this building  and fucking, and like, why don't they move?  It's like, it makes no sense.  It's just savages.  The first one was great with the fucking, that roving gang of idiots.  The first Death Wish is great because he, it's, he goes through a metamorphosis. 
[02:05:30]  He's not a violent guy in the beginning.  He vomits the first time he, he has an encounter when he hits the guy with the quarters.  He becomes a violent person and he's going, look, I'm, I'm, I'm just going to shoot every  scumbag I see and, and hopefully I'll get the guys that killed my family.  You know, and, and every other Death Wish after that, there's like five, five bad guys  attack him.  He hunts him down and kills him.  So it's just a revenge piece.  But the original Death Wish, he never encounters the guys that, you know, raped his family.  Jeff Goldblum. 
[02:06:00]  No, he never gets Jeff Goldblum.  He just shoots anybody.  I'm too rich, cunt.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's great.  Was that the one where they, they raped the, uh, wife?  They, they kill the wife.  No, no, no, no.  They beat the wife to death with a blackjack and a, they kick her with a fucking heavy bull.  And then they spray paint the girl's ass with red paint.  It was a hot scene.  Very violent scene.  Very disturbing.  It was really sexy, too.  Look, Danny finds it.  Death Wish 3 is fucking, it's so funny.  If you watch that.  He's just annoyed being there. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, yeah.  Charles Brunson, I'm annoyed.  They slapped that together because right after the Bernard Getz case happened.  That was a huge story.  What road are they on there?  That's the helix.  It's like the Gowanus or something.  I'm going to the Port Authority.  Oh, yeah.  I got that smelly urine.  I have to shoot somebody.  It's fucking funny as shit.  I dig.  To get out.  I dig.  Yeah.  Death Wish 3.  Death Wish 3, it's when he has carpeting installed and they don't cut it right.  He goes out and blows their fucking heads off. 
[02:07:00]  He kills the tacker.  Yeah.  Brunson was great, though.  He was underrated.  He just, he would take any, any movie for a million bucks.  Give me a million.  Give Jill 300,000.  We'll be there.  He didn't, I don't think he read scripts, you know?  He was great.  He was good.  And what was the one where the fucking guy with the best ass in movie history is running  down the street?  Warren.  He's killing people naked.  Oh, yeah.  For checking off.  Use this foot.  10 to midnight.  10 to midnight.  Checking off.  But in the 60s, he was in every movie in the 60s, every important film.  The Great Escape. 
[02:07:30]  The Great Escape was, yeah, a great movie.  The Magnificent Seven.  Battle of the Bulge.  Once Upon a Time in the West.  It was fucking, Brunson was good.  Once Upon a Time in the West, he was Harmonica, right?  Yeah, yeah, they wanted Eastwood for that.  That was the first Spaghetti Western, right?  No.  Well, no, it was supposed to be Eastwood, but he got tired of it by then.  You went for two facts.  It wasn't the first Spaghetti Western.  That was what you were eating when you watched it.  That's the one where Fonda was a bad guy.  Yeah, that was Fonda. 
[02:08:00]  He shot a kid, right?  Yeah, he goes, well, now that you told him my name, he fucking shoots a five-year-old kid.  Oh, yeah, he was a nine-year-old ginger in the first fucking scene.  Oh, it's fantastic.  Yeah, it's vicious.  But, yeah, I'm fucking Henry Fonda.  Once Upon a Time in the West?  Yeah.  Was that before, like, Fistful of Dollars, Good, the Bad, and the Ugly?  No, it was after.  Right, so that was Spaghetti Westerns.  It was after Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, so he had the best budget.  They said it was actually the best of the Leone movies.  It was.  But Eastwood by then was like, that's it, I got to do a Hollywood film. 
[02:08:30]  He couldn't stand it anymore.  Yeah, he had to go hang around with fucking orangutans.  Yeah, fucking asshole.  Yeah, that was the second highest grossing movie of that year.  Oh, I thought you were talking about another movie.  But anyway.  Any Which Way But Loose you were talking about.  Yeah.  Okay, yeah, yeah.  But anyway, about rich people, like, I just don't think rich people need comedy.  It's the blue, you know, blue collar, you know, the people that came through the virus  tours were, like, you know, working class.  Those are the people that need comedy. 
[02:09:00]  Rich people don't need comedy.  I don't understand.  They don't need laughter.  They have a wonderful life.  They wake up laughing.  And these aren't people that earn it.  All the way to the bank.  They were too young to have earned it themselves, these people.  Yeah.  They fucking inherited it.  It angers me, you know.  I mean, I know Jim's parents.  They're fucking working class people.  Jim is fucking, whatever he has, he earned.  And he fucking, he deserves it.  When I was growing up, if I wanted toys, my mother had to sell her pussy.  I thought that was your toy.  I know both of Jim's parents. 
[02:09:30]  They're very, very wonderful people.  I liked it.  Hey, what was the, what was your, do you remember what your opening joke was?  Was it this one you've used before?  Or was it just like, did you try something off the cuff?  No, I did something.  It's nice to play a room that you could land, you know, land a helicopter in.  Something about it being too big.  Like, you know, comedy club should be, you know, low ceiling.  I don't want to attend what did the opening line get.  Did it get any kind of laugh?  They were all sitting back.  They were all fucking stuffed from crab legs and prime rib and an open bar for fucking 10 hours. 
[02:10:00]  Fucking all sunbaked and fucking rich.  Oh, I want sunbaked and rich.  Every detail of the story makes me happy.  It sounds so fun.  And the richest guy there, you know, you know that scene in Scarface when he's going to,  the fat guy in the nightclub, he goes, he's got more cash than anybody in there.  He's a real hossa.  So the guy who hired me, he goes, that guy there, he goes, he's got the fucking $35 million  yard out there.  He's like a James Bond villain, you know, and just all fat with a big Hawaiian shirt. 
[02:10:30]  It's like, so what?  It's fucking going to be a fucking heart attack waiting to happen.  I wanted to just fucking gut him like the fucking shark in Jaws.  I had so much rage in me.  How much time did you do?  How much time were you supposed to do?  How much time?  I don't really know how much time I did, but, but their demeanors were a lot different  afterwards.  Really?  Before, before the thing, it was like, oh, can we get you?  You go, it's a wonderful day.  Oh yeah.  Well, you're big O&E fans.  And then after the show, they just gave me the check. 
[02:11:00]  Couldn't even look at me.  What the fuck is wrong with them?  Do they know you?  Look, I, I, I, I know a bomb.  I know when I don't give a good performance.  I know when it's my fault.  This was an inappropriate booking.  Why the fuck do you need a comedian?  And why do you put me on after they eat?  You know, what is it?  They're Jews.  They're not going to leave until they get this sponge cake.  You know, put me on when they're still hungry and lean.  They're fat fucking overfed rich cunts.  I fucking hate them.  You know, I couldn't wait to get back to a fucking shitty bar gig, which is my, pretty 
[02:11:30]  much my entire career and just perform for real people.  You know, that, you know, that, no, I, I, I could have beat the shit out of 90% of  the guys there.  And I'm a small guy with, with, with almost no fighting experience.  You know, I could have just those.  I had so much rage.  I could have fucking bit.  I could have killed them.  Long Island, East end of Long Island motherfuckers.  Just the way they wouldn't even give me, you know, fucking a fake laugh or anything,  you know, just, just humor me.  It was a horrible drive out there, man. 
[02:12:00]  It takes forever.  Oh, to leave Midtown to go to fucking Montauk on a Friday was a fucking horrible.  The highway stops.  At one point, the highway just ends and you're on like a fucking windy road.  We crawled the Long Island Expressway the entire way.  And then you got to get on this fucking other shitty road where they sell, you know, vegetables  and shit on the side of the road where everybody's fucking taking their time.  It turns into Pennsylvania.  If I didn't have, if I didn't have to perform there.  It really does.  If I didn't have to perform that night, it would have been a wonderful, wonderful time. 
[02:12:30]  It was a beautiful place, you know, the staff was really cold and, you know, but, uh, boy,  I feel like a fucking circus monkey.  I was really depressed.  I mean, physically depressed.  Yeah.  For about four days after that.  I was really, I was really like not suicidal, but I just, I couldn't snap out of it.  Jesus.  How long after that was your 50th?  This, um, like just a couple of days after that.  After?  So you had that on top of it?  I mean, I made more out of it than I should have.  I, you know, everybody's going, Hey man, you, you kill all the time. 
[02:13:00]  So what?  You bomb.  But it's like, ah, fuck.  I did all this stuff.  All this stuff that usually cheers me up, like going for a walk or just playing with my dog  or putting on a movie like that makes me laugh all the time.  Like big Lebowski, nothing worked.  Nothing.  Wow.  And it was, the sun was shining.  I go get some sun.  That'll cheer you up.  I was just fucking, it was in a funk, man.  Jesus.  You think it was the combo of like 50?  Cause how'd you deal with that? 
[02:13:30]  Were you freaking out a little bit?  Oh, about the, well, the, no, it's like, you know, I outlived JFK by, by, by, by, um,  four, what was he?  Forty, five, four years, you know?  So.  And a brain.  That's true.  Although he did better in Dallas than you did in Montauk.  Oh, shit.  Holy shit.  But that, that wasn't, uh. 
[02:14:00]  It was not good.  It wasn't freaking you out or anything?  The, uh, the 50 wasn't.  No, no.  It's, no, it's good.  You know?  I mean, I, I lost like, I lost a lot of friends that didn't even make it to like 40.  Yeah.  You know, and I was the one that everybody thought would die cause of my drug problem  and shit.  And why, and, and, uh, and this guy, this guy, Ray Garvey, who you knew, right?  Yeah, sure, man.  Ray Garvey could snap anybody in half.  He was a fucking powerful guy.  That's copy.  He died of cancer.  That fucking, that scared the shit out of me.  I go, if this guy could die, that means, that means anybody could, this guy was fucking 
[02:14:30]  powerful.  He was strong, wasn't he?  He was a powerful fuck, man.  Really?  He, he, he gave me a pat on the back once and I thought I had to go to the emergency room.  It's good to see you, Ralph.  It's good to see you, Ralph.  Yeah, Garvey, rest in peace.  He was a fucking funny guy, man.  He used to, we used to go bar hopping in Brooklyn and he would fucking make, he would go, he  would run the light and I go, what are you doing?  I got the badge.  He was a cop at the time.  I got the badge.  I go, you're running a red light.  What if we get hit by a cement truck?  What's the badge going to do? 
[02:15:00]  Is that going to get you out of a wheelchair?  I go, you're out of control, man.  I got the badge.  I'm on the job.  I drive like a fucking old lady.  And then he used to shoot canned hams behind pips and sheep's head bait with cars going  by.  And cars going by, boom.  I got a badge.  Yeah.  He was a fucking sick fuck.  Oh, that's hysterical.  I'd love to do that.  He was great though.  He was in a bunch of Woody Allen movies and shit.  Oh, yeah?  Woody liked him.  Woody liked him a lot.  Oh, shit.  But Ray was a pisser.  He had stomach cancer. 
[02:15:30]  The worst kind.  Yeah.  Fucking, he suffered badly.  Yeah.  Didn't they find it late though?  Like, he wasn't, I don't think he was a doctor kind of guy.  I think they found it when he was like stage three or four.  Like, he was in bad shape when they found it.  I think when he got the job at the Borgata, I think that's when he got sick.  Because he was probably fucking eating steak like five times a day and shit.  Raw red meat.  He told me he never ate fruits or vegetables his entire life.  His, you know, he just, just fucking meat in his colon.  The last thing they did to try and fix him was they actually cut him open and poured 
[02:16:00]  fucking, what is that stuff?  Drano?  Not Drano.  Fucking chemotherapy.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The chemo stuff.  Radiation shit.  Really?  They poured it right onto the, it was like the last resort.  Oh, my man.  Yeah.  But he fucking.  He was awake for that?  I don't know if he was awake for it.  What torture is that?  No, but he either could numb you.  Yeah.  Numb you?  They're cutting open your stomach and pouring it on.  He still has his fucking jeans and sneakers on.  It's a local, like the dentist.  No, but I'm saying, Edward Kennedy. 
[02:16:30]  Edward Kennedy was awake when they drilled into his head.  Really?  Ted Kennedy.  I'm sorry.  For some brain operations, you have to be awake for it because they ask you questions.  They numb your fucking head.  Was that the way they were?  Were they pouring shit into the watches?  Why did they have to see if you're, they have to make sure they're not affecting your  motor functions.  Yeah.  Or sometimes it's to see if you are affecting a certain thing.  That's like, if you have a tremor or something like that, and they want to calm it down,  they poke at your fucking brain with some shit until it stops.  And then they just zap that part of your fucking brain. 
[02:17:00]  Sick shit.  Who does that?  Fucking archaic.  Brain surgeons.  Oh, fuck.  Yes, I hope.  They don't know.  The guy down at fucking Jiffy Loop.  Fucking drill a hole in it.  But apparently your brain doesn't have...  Doctors are very overrated, man.  They don't know what the fuck...  They don't even...  You want to think they do.  They don't even know what the common cold...  They don't know how the central nervous system works.  We're tinker toys to them.  They know how to stitch and be in an arm cut off.  They can do that.  They're kind of like mechanics. 
[02:17:30]  They don't know.  They don't give a...  And the other thing is, they don't really care about you.  You know, what if Saturday Night Live is on and you're screaming for morphine in the next room  and they want to see, you know, their favorite host?  They don't give a fuck.  Yeah, they're going to love you.  They don't wait.  Yeah, they're not family.  As soon as you get to a hospital, get the fuck up.  If you can walk, walk out of there.  They're not going to help you.  Fuck that, man.  But not all doctors are good either.  Like, they're shitty.  My first knee doctor did a shoulder operation on my knee from 1992 that they stopped doing. 
[02:18:00]  And then when I went to the next guy, which is Asian guy who did the Jets,  he almost filed a suit against this guy.  He was like, we haven't done this in fucking eight years.  There's just some horrible...  Yeah, shitty hospitals with gum under the operating table and fucking...  They don't love you.  My doctor, Dr. Vinnie Boombats, told me.  Oh, hey.  Hey!  I didn't all have...  I'm going to say the plug.  Yeah, you don't know...  Like, you'd like to think they know what they're doing and shit, but...  They're just...  But they also don't care about you. 
[02:18:30]  And they're terrified of doing the wrong thing.  Yeah.  They're paralyzed with fear about doing the wrong thing.  So they'll get sued.  So they do nothing.  You know, and they wait for the next doctor to come in.  You know, we're not going to do anything.  You know...  Yeah, pass it on to him.  They're paralyzed with fear.  And then if a doctor fucks up, they're not going to say that that doctor fucked up.  It's like the, you know...  Nobody wants to go to medical school anymore because there's too much litigation and shit.  They're constantly being sued.  Yeah. 
[02:19:00]  For trouble.  Yeah.  Some of them legitimately because they are fucking pieces of shit.  Yeah.  Other ones, eh.  Who knows?  There's no noble fucking doctors.  Hey, rent the aristocrat.  See me in that.  Can't get enough of this yacht gig.  Yeah.  I know.  I'd love to hear.  If I would have said, how was it I destroyed, I would have never had another question about it.  No, no.  But with a comic, you know, it's like, you want to hear about bad gigs.  They're more fun for us to hear about.  Yeah.  Every horrible moment is a fucking, is a novel to me.  How long did you stay after they, after you were done? 
[02:19:30]  You know, if I had another comic with me, but the fact that Trish is like, you know,  wants to, you know, do this roadside shit and look for jelly the next day, you know.  You stayed out there?  No, no.  We stayed overnight and then the next day we drove back.  But, you know, I wanted to fucking either murder somebody, shoot heroin or shoot myself  with a bullet.  And she wanted to buy jam and fucking, oh, nectarine stand.  You didn't want to get nectarines?  You know, she's been around me a long time and she doesn't still, doesn't understand that 
[02:20:00]  comedy is a very hard job and it's, it's not physically hard.  She, you know, she goes, well, you get to, like, she's, I'm, I'm, I'm bitching about  when I got up this morning.  Get up.  Well, she goes, you got, you saw it, you got to get up at six o'clock twice a year,  you pussy.  Cunt.  I think it's funny that she's, she's happily nectarine shopping while fucking cranky auto  sets in the car.  She's not just squeezing nectarines, trying to find the right one.  And he's just fucking mumbling into the fucking rear view mirror alone. 
[02:20:30]  About rich, rich cunts.  Yeah.  God damn rich cunts.  Fucking 50 years and I'm bombing in a yacht club.  She's fucking picking out fruit like Brenda before he gets shot.  Yeah.  I don't know.  This, um, this took place a long time ago.  Did I ever tell my Jack Nicholson story?  No.  I was at, um, well, this is when I was a street performer in Central Park and I was my, my first  girlfriend, her name was Martha.  She worked at Bloomingdale's. 
[02:21:00]  I mean, I used to go, I, I would do a few shows in the park and I'd go see her.  So I was, um, I was, she, she worked on like the second or third floor and I'm staying  there, you know, she's talking to a customer and I hear behind me, honey, can we get out  of here now?  These fucking lamps are giving me a headache and I go, ah, it's a good Nicholson.  I turn around and fucking Jack Nicholson is standing there with Angelica Houston and  she's like lamp shopping and dragging him to the store.  Like any other pussy with boyfriend, this is right after like the shining came out and I 
[02:21:30]  was like, holy shit, fucking Jack Nicholson was like, I got, I was like buzzing the rest  of the day just to have been in this, like a few feet from him.  But there he is like any other schluck.  Like any other guy being dragged to the store, but he, but he was, he's, he was just exactly  like he is in the movies, like cranky with sunglasses.  It was great.  These fucking lamps are giving me a headache.  That's great.  I mean, drag off to that fucking, oh, what's up, uh, Chip?  You should have done like an impression to him and said, I'm just going to break your 
[02:22:00]  bulbs in or something like that for the shining.  Fucking Chip.  Very good, Chip.  Thanks.  I fucking hate Chip.  I fucking can't stand Chip.  You know Chip's Coney, right?  You know, he was, he was on the market.  I sat behind that cunt judge on the plane.  The English guy?  That British douchebag, yeah.  He got pretty far though.  He went like to the third fucking sector and shit.  Um, you guys should have him up here as a guest.  He's got a lot of good stories, man. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  I love chips.  He fucking, he met Steve McQueen.  He was in, he was a jazz drummer.  He knew Pesci and them when they were in a musical group.  Oh, Frank Vincent, I think.  He tried out for the Yankees.  He's got like a life story.  Jesus Christ.  He's got a life, a really cool life story.  What kind of life story is this?  Well, I mean, yeah, I mean, it ends up with, you know, him being a comedian, but.  That ain't bad though.  Yeah.  Try out for the fucking Yankees.  That sucks that, uh, that America's got talent.  No, you don't get paid unless you get the million.  They gave him $25 a day fucking food per diem. 
[02:23:00]  That's it?  Yeah.  What am I, a squirrel?  You gotta, you gotta love these fucking shows.  There's no overhead.  Howie Mandel was great.  Howie Mandel got him though, you know.  Howie Mandel definitely fucking got him.  Yeah.  He got what he was doing.  He's, he's a comic, you know.  My, my respect for him went way up.  I always thought he was a little fucking douche with a balloon on his head, but.  Yeah.  You know, cause he could, you know, anybody that helps a friend of mine, fucking, he's  alright with me now.  A little loyalty.  Yeah.  He needs some loyalty in his business.  He needs a lot of loyalty. 
[02:23:30]  In his goddamn business.  It's not, it's not the business.  It's like, you know, what else is life made up of, you know.  You, you gotta have some friends.  Very important.  Yeah.  You know what I think we should do, Jim?  Um.  Fucking milk each other?  All, uh.  What is milk now?  All, all learn from that life lesson?  I got that.  You should have friends.  No, I got this.  What?  I think.  When was the last time you had a bomb?  I mean, when.  Oh, dude.  I had, I'll tell you.  Do you bomb intentionally just cause you're so tired of the approval?  No.  No.  Cause come on, when you, when you do a show now, it's ONA fans. 
[02:24:00]  You're a fucking rock star when you get on stage.  I haven't bombed as a headliner in a while.  My last, like, death bomb.  Yeah.  I couldn't get out of it.  Yeah.  Death bomb.  Which, when I was warming up for Leno stuff, I had like a seven, ten minute clean set that  I was working on.  Right.  And I went into a small room, and I, I bombed, it was like one of those bombs where you're  like.  Well, one of those coffee houses in LA, like.  No, it was in New York.  Oh.  But it was, I mean, it wasn't a lot of people, but it was still a fucking horrible, like, I can't  get out of this.  Did you do that set on Leno in spite of that? 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, but not, it was like a few.  A week later or whatever, but I was trying to time it out, and, but it was like one  of those bombs that you couldn't get out of.  It was like, it was a putrid bomb.  I was like, I was like shaken up by it.  Like, after I walked out of there, I was like.  Wow.  That was like, wow.  Doubting everything you've ever done.  I'm in the business five weeks.  There's a difference between.  Did you, did you see anybody else go on that night?  Were they rejected?  Yeah, they were doing it.  The guy before me did fine.  It was me.  There's a difference between.  Like, I know what he's, he's getting paid probably good money. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah, yeah.  To fuck, you know, I've, I've bombed.  I was hired for an Indian wedding.  That's an inappropriate booking.  You didn't bomb?  Like, rich, rich fucking Indians.  Yeah.  Downtown.  Fuck that.  It was just fucking millionaires, and they had me come out and do comedy.  And you took, you, you agreed to that just for the money.  You have.  You don't.  You get the money, but you also, but you also, they, what happened with him, what happens  all the time where there's one guy that goes to the cellar all the time and says, you got  to get this guy.  He's hell.  And he sells you on everybody else. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  But he sells you to like five or six people, not 80% of the people, 20% of the people are  like, yeah.  But then he, but then when you're doing your show, he won't laugh because he, you know,  he doesn't want to look bad in front of his friends, you know, faster.  Oh, he hangs out to dry too.  I actually, I actually had one of those bombings so bad, same shit, wouldn't even look at me  after the show.  This twat let her kid pick me out of a tape.  And she was, and she was like, my kid said you were the one.  I lost the, I was so nervous and shell-shocked, I lost the check. 
[02:26:00]  It was for thousands.  Yeah.  I lost it at the gig.  So I finally made it out of there.  It was over.  I'm walking home.  It's like fucking 20 below January, New York City.  Was that the Indian wedding place?  No.  Oh, this was a Christmas party gig I did.  And I fucking had to go back and get the fucking, I had to go back.  Hi.  And she was like, what the fuck?  What?  And I was like, I lost the check.  And now I had to go back in the room and look, go all the spots I were looking for this 
[02:26:30]  check.  Horrible story.  And then I finally realized, just mail it to me.  Fuck it.  But I was nervous that they would say, fuck you.  She was mad that you came back?  Yeah.  I just ruined her fucking, ruined her Indian party.  I ruined Ed Fuck.  It's ruined.  That's happened to me so many times.  Oh my, you ruined her, everybody.  It's the worst.  You had one O&A fan that was like, you're going to kill.  Yeah.  They have no concept of comedy.  Yeah.  They have no, they just think we can just jump anywhere.  And da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  The yachts out there was sick, man. 
[02:27:00]  It was like, you know, fucking James Bond villain kind of money.  Yeah, giant fucking bo-hole.  If you did good, you would have been on one of those.  Bikini-clad whores.  Fucking Pacino will be handing you an envelope with a fucking card in it that said, a friend  of ours with a hundred.  Oh, remember that?  Yeah.  Oh, is that horrible, that scene?  The remaking Arthur now with Trish works in a Brill building.  What the fuck?  Fuck, I just, I just watched that movie maybe two nights ago. 
[02:27:30]  I just watched the original movie.  Fucking, yeah.  It was really funny, man.  You forget how funny Dudley Moore is in that goddamn movie.  Oh.  God damn.  It was great, great, great, great, great, great comedy.  You're a hooker.  All of his little mannerisms and shit.  Great, great comedy.  Yeah.  Don't you hate Perry's wife?  Yeah.  It's such a performance.  Go in there, Perry.  It's a real performance.  Oh, you're a hedge.  Hey, how is Montreal, Jim?  He talks in the baby that's not there.  Yeah, Jim, you did the Montreal thing this year?  Yeah, it was, the nasty show was good. 
[02:28:00]  Bob, we did it, we did it together.  Pretty, pretty grueling, right?  Three, three.  Yeah, I've done it before and I always say no to it.  That Club Soda thing?  Club Soda, yeah, it's like fucking 16 shows in a week.  It's a lot of work.  But then I went back and I flew home.  That's a hot show in town, man.  It is, but it means nothing.  It just makes money for the festival, but it doesn't help us career-wise.  I saw two wine neighborhoods beat the shit out of each other in the alleyway.  It's entertaining.  I mean, this guy bashed this guy's fucking skull in and he was back 20 minutes later drinking  at that shitty bar. 
[02:28:30]  What a shithole neighborhood.  That's a shit neighborhood, you're right.  Well, they actually took away a lot.  I was there three years ago and it was a lot worse.  They had all the, yeah, they had all the strip.  They did?  Yeah, they took all those buildings down, all the strip clubs and all the fucking, they  have like one cock shop left.  Cock shop.  That's it.  You walk into the street, it's a cafe, cafe, window of dicks, and then a cafe, and then poutine.  Who else is on the show with you guys?  Geraldo hosted.  Voss.  Voss, me, Bobby, and a girl named Tiffany Haddish. 
[02:29:00]  And I think it was the whole show.  That was it.  Oh, so only one Canadian or you, they always have to get one.  No Canadian.  No Canadians.  She was a black girl and us.  Oh shit.  So all Americans?  Wow.  Yeah.  They fucking really treat their own like shit, the Canadians.  They have a self-hatred problem, I think.  They do?  They should.  Yeah, it's an inferiority complex because the United States is right down here.  I did it with Dennis Leary the first time.  We went through customs with fucking Mary Tyler Moore. 
[02:29:30]  She was like on the gala show that year.  Me and Dennis Leary got, we both had had arrests.  Mine was for marijuana, smoking pot in a car, and he had like a couple of DUIs, but they  sat us down like we were fucking criminals in a room and said, were you over arrest?  We want you to admit it.  Tell us what you did.  Tell you, don't fuck up here.  We don't fucking, I go, I smoked some fucking pot in a car when I was 19.  So what?  Treat me like fucking Dillinger?  They really were grilling you like you just committed a crime. 
[02:30:00]  They acted like I was fucking Dillinger, man.  You know, what do you think, you're a different country?  If somebody fucks with you, who do you think's going to come and kick their ass?  You better be fucking nice to Americans, you fuck.  I hate those people.  Jimmy, did you see the whole thing with Lady Gaga and that Arizona?  I heard that she made some nonsensical point about it.  It was a ridiculous point. 
[02:30:30]  And you've got to see Death Wish 3 all the way through.  You'll fucking laugh.  Sorry.  No, it's great.  Shut up.  Okay, sir.  What got me about the whole thing is they were talking about how she said she was still  going to do the show because some people said she shouldn't do the show in Arizona and she  was still going to do the show.  Yet she gets up there and starts talking about Arizona, how shitty their policy is on the 
[02:31:00]  immigration thing.  And then she said, you know, what are a bunch of stupid rock stars going to do to stop,  you know, this legislation?  So I figured I'd do the show.  And then you think, like, didn't musicians pretty much end apartheid by not fucking playing  in Sun City and South Africa?  They just wouldn't fucking go down there and really kind of brought that whole thing to  light?  Did they?  I don't know.  Yeah.  That was like a huge thing during apartheid. 
[02:31:30]  And she's just like, oh, yeah, well, I have this point and Arizona sucks and this legislation  sucks and the Mexicans should be able to come up here.  But now I'm still going to fucking sell the T-shirts and play the gig and fucking take  the money.  I hate those guys who do one thing to try and help the world.  Fucking cut a check, you know?  Just cut a check and shut up.  A lot of businesses wouldn't.  A lot of major companies stopped doing business with South Africa because colleges were 
[02:32:00]  protesting.  A lot of gas companies wouldn't.  Like, that's, I think, what finally stopped it.  No, I don't think any one thing stopped it.  But that really brought, like, worldwide attention to it when they did that whole fucking  song.  They did, like, a We Are The World thing for fucking apartheid.  They did, like, a song.  Didn't they do a stupid fucking song about that?  I remember Bono being involved, of course.  Fucking walking around saying it's horrible.  Well, now, you know, now we'll look at South Africa.  Okay.  You want to be in charge here?  Is it pretty bad over there? 
[02:32:30]  Have fun.  Whoa.  They've been fighting for, like, years and years and years, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The white majority gave up.  The white sharks are fucking gone.  The white majority.  Minority.  Wow.  Yeah, that was bad.  Hello.  I fucking skid right over that.  Because you didn't say great white sharks.  You said even the white sharks are gone.  Yeah.  Wow.  I thought maybe just some fucking white people.  Man, it was Shark Week.  Yes.  Yes, it is.  The white minority down there gave up power. 
[02:33:00]  Oh.  And the black majority took over.  Right.  And I don't think anyone wants to play down there anymore.  Yeah.  It's like District 9, right?  Yeah.  It really is not a nice place.  The Prawn.  Yeah.  That guy was such an unlikely lead in the film.  If you ever see that movie, it's fucking great.  Because, like, one second he's, like, he does the right thing and he's, like, great. 
[02:33:30]  And then he's, like, bad.  And it's like, you don't know which way.  Yeah, he was in here one day and I was talking to him about that.  It's like.  What an amazing film.  I said, like.  Name dropper.  Well, it was a guest of the program.  Yeah.  And I asked him if that character was supposed to be so fucking goofy at the beginning of  the movie.  Yeah.  Because it turns out he's kind of like some badass at the end.  Yeah.  And he said he was supposed to be even goofier than that.  Really?  And they kind of tamed it down.  Because he's hysterical.  Unlikely lead in a film. 
[02:34:00]  It was just going, like, oh, look at the little one.  Come here.  It's Mr. Sweetie Man.  Yeah, yeah.  And he smacks him with the cat.  You little fucker.  You little fucker.  I knew you fucking prudence were smart.  It's fucking great, though, man.  The fucking cat food.  Oh, God.  Funny ass movie.  It's, uh, yeah.  I didn't know where the fuck that was going.  That had me from the second it started.  Yeah, yeah.  And I'm not a big science fiction fan at all.  Really?  No.  You pegged for, like, kind of sci-fi.  Well, yeah.  Like, 2001, I loved.  I didn't give a shit about any of the Star Wars. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  I could not get into that baby.  It was like, I don't know.  It was too stupid for me.  Yeah, well, when it came out, I was into it.  Really?  But I was kind of young.  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess it was a child thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Now you watch them, and it's just like, oh, God.  This could have been so good.  No, I always liked urban crime films.  That genre.  Good comedy or urban, you know, stuff like Godfather Goodfellas.  Yeah, I like, I like.  Like, very narrow taste in films.  Good crime shit, and then also post-apocalyptic stuff, I like. 
[02:35:00]  You do?  Yeah.  Zombie shit.  Oh, zombie shit.  I'm very big on anything with a zombie.  Except I don't like when they make them into comedies.  That bothers me.  Yeah, yeah.  And it also bothers me when zombies move too quickly.  Really?  Well, we've had this argument many, many times.  No, zombies are fucked up.  And the thing with zombies is they can't outrun you.  They just, there's so many of them that they eventually scratch their way in and eat you.  And get you.  But when they start moving like vampires, it's not a zombie move anymore.  Well, I don't like fast, fast zombies, but I like a zombie that can kind of get at you. 
[02:35:30]  You like that startlecy when they lunge at you.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  But when they can fucking run fast, it's not a zombie move.  I like that they're all Kenyan zombies.  They run very quickly.  Now, George Romero set down the book of rules on what zombies are.  There are rules to, you know, there should be rules to monsters.  You know, you kill Dracula with a stake through the heart.  Or the wolfman, you need a silver bullet.  There should be rules.  Yeah, don't change them up.  But if you remember the first Night of the Living Dead, we were talking about this the other day, when Barbara's in the cemetery. 
[02:36:00]  The first zombie.  And then she gets out, that first zombie is kind of coming after her car.  He's hauling ass a little.  He's got a little jog on.  All right.  He's got his jog on a little bit, which is odd, because every other zombie after that was just kind of, ugh.  Yeah.  You know, but he was, uh...  Romero rewrote those zombie rules a bunch of times throughout his films, though.  Like, I don't like the fact that, you know, zombies could remember their past lives and, you know, little bits and pieces of it, like in Day of the Dead, when Bub knows to shave with a razor. 
[02:36:30]  I hate the Bub one.  Oh, where he teaches them how to use the Walkman?  Yeah, come on, man.  I don't like the one with Bub.  And they shouldn't be able to use tools.  That was Romero's favorite, he said.  Yeah.  Wow, that's fucked up.  There was some good gore in that, though, man.  When that guy gets ripped right in half and he sees his own lower body being dragged away...  That's pretty twisted.  You ever play Call of Duty with the zombies, where they just come out, they just, they keep coming?  I fucking hated zombies until I did that.  But he's right. 
[02:37:00]  When they just, it's not they're fast.  It's, there's a fucking million of them.  But I liked, see, the fast zombies were...  Like the Ving Rhames remake.  I enjoyed it, but I enjoyed, I mean, I loved watching it, but I go, it's not zombies.  It's something else.  They're just fast zombies.  Fast dead people.  Fast dead people.  Or 28 Days Later was another one.  But that was a virus, so...  They're all good.  They're all good shit.  They moved fast.  But I love that shit.  It's fucking, you know, survival.  Yeah.  What was that vampire movie where they were in Alaska and they had, what was it? 
[02:37:30]  Oh, yeah.  30 Days a Night.  30 Days a Night.  That was a fucking good vampire movie.  Yeah, that was, the sun went down for fucking a month.  I can't believe no one's ever thought of that.  I know.  It's like fucking Alaska's dark for a month.  That's what I thought.  It's like, it could be out all the time.  A bunch of vampires shoveling their driveways.  Oh, yeah.  It stinks.  There's a zombie movie made by an Italian director just called Zombie.  Did you ever see that one?  Yes, it's awesome.  Lucio.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking great.  There's a zombie fights a shark underwater and fucking eats the shark. 
[02:38:00]  He fights a shark.  There's violent shit.  Really violent shit in that.  And it's funny that we were just talking about Romero, because he kind of stole a piece  of that film for his later shit.  He did?  Where, what was that awful one with John Leguizamo?  I don't even want to think about Land of the Dead.  Oh, right.  Where the zombies traveled to the...  Dennis Hopper was in it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They traveled to the island by walking underwater.  Oh, they walk on the bottom of the fucking...  Oh, is that right?  Is that where he got from?  Yeah, that was kind of lifted from Zombie, I think.  Yeah, the Italians made some good, good shit. 
[02:38:30]  When they used to have chiller theater when I was a kid...  Chiller.  I would watch that.  There would always be a lot of nudity and big-titted women.  In those Italian horror films.  I liked the old black and white ones they'd show on Creature Feature, a chiller theater.  That was more of the universal Lon Chaney.  Yeah, yeah.  Those are great.  But they would have...  They were black and white, but they would have those damsels in distress with the fucking  tits just hanging out of the top of their dress, screaming as like the... 
[02:39:00]  Wasn't Creature Double Feature mostly Asian, though?  No, Creature Feature sometimes showed Godzilla movies, but they'd also show some...  You know, some of the classics like fucking...  Well, the two great Italian monster guys with Dario Angento who did the Suspiria or something  like that.  Yeah, Suspiria.  And then another guy, Mario Bava, who like invented the whole genre in like the early 60s.  Very gory shit.  But there were times when I was a kid, I got up from in front of the TV and ran away with 
[02:39:30]  my friends just like screaming.  House on Haunted Hill was one of them.  Oh, that fucking woman coming out with her fucking hands out?  That was so creepy, man.  That's still a disturbing image now.  That was Vincent Price.  That's fucked up.  It's a fucked up image.  Yeah, because she was floating.  Yeah.  She liked...  It wasn't a walking thing.  And she's not like trying to hurt anybody.  She's just in the room and she's like just skates by and you go, what the fuck?  Yeah, and she's like got these arthritic hands held up and all crinkled. 
[02:40:00]  That was some scary shit.  And her face is fucked up.  And she just drifted at you.  And we were just like...  Yeah.  Had to run out of there.  That's a disturbing image.  The other one was The Last Man on Earth with Vincent Price.  Yeah.  Where the woman's knocking and she's going, let me in.  Last Man on Earth was the first version of the...  Omega Man kind of I Am Legend.  I Am Legend, yeah.  Yeah.  And he was supposed to burn his wife because she had the plague.  Yeah.  And he didn't burn her.  He buried her.  Oh, yeah.  And she came back to fucking life.  And she's going, let me in. 
[02:40:30]  And he opens the door and she fucking grabs him.  The Tingler.  That had some fucking fucked up shit in it.  Yeah.  I want to see the fucking lady floating.  Because I think I remember that.  Wasn't there a lady floating in the movie Black Sabbath, too, with Boris Karloff?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  There was, right?  Oh, that was a very scary trilogy, Black Sabbath.  Yes.  There was like three stories.  Yes.  A headless horseman or something.  Yeah.  But that woman floating was terrifying. 
[02:41:00]  Fucking those movies.  That's a Mario Bava.  That's a fucking good shit.  They use that clip in a commercial now.  That fucking clip from that.  The underwater shot.  Yeah, it's in a commercial.  Yeah, it's in a Windows 7 commercial.  Oh, is it?  What year is that movie from?  It's like the early 70s.  But there's one scene where this girl's like hiding in a closet and the zombie like breaks  through the closet and he's pulling her eye towards this shard of wood.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And the fucking eye, the fucking thing goes through her eye and like rips through her  temple.  And you see the whole thing happen.  And it's like, and there's a big chunk of wood going like through her eye. 
[02:41:30]  It was a close up, like a close up of it.  Oh, yeah.  And you see the eyeball and the fucking, it was.  And this big splintery piece of wood just goes right through.  And you see it like compress and then pokes through.  It could not have been gorier.  Yeah, really disgusting.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, there you go.  Danny finds everything.  This is awesome.  Watch this.  It's very cheap.  It's cheap, but it's so like.  It's a cheap model.  But the thought of that actually happening to you is bad.  Yeah, that's what it is.  It's not so much the effect as it is the thought of that happening. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, that's pretty cheap right there.  It goes right through the eye, Molo.  George has the mirror.  Yeah.  This fucking guy's ruining someone's puppet.  My eye has got a piece of wood in it.  Yeah.  Kind of fucking sick, though.  Yeah.  Oh, Christ.  Want to take a little breather and.  Yeah, make love.  I'm at Wisecrackers at the Ramada Inn in Allentown, PA.  This weekend, 9 p.m. show, Wisecrackers. 
[02:42:30]  Wisecrackers.  Wisecrackers.  JFK's in a casket.  And I'm at Wisecrackers in Ramada Inn.  Who do you feel worse for?  I'm going to be at the Off the Hook Comedy Club on Marco Island.  Marco Island?  Yeah, it's an island.  That sounds nice.  They're Marco.  How do you get there?  You have to take a boat or a train.  Take a ferry?  Or a submarine.  There's submarine ferries.  Oh, like Lost.  August 19th to the 22nd, Captain Brian.  You ever play Off the Hooks?  You've been there, Off the Hooks? 
[02:43:00]  I don't think I have.  You sure?  Yeah, pretty sure.  You'd like it.  I would remember that.  It's all right.  With the captain.  It's good on on-season.  Off-season, there's like two people on the fucking island.  You need a passport to get there?  No, it's in Florida.  It's in Florida?  Yeah.  You take a fucking $100 JetBlue flight and you're there.  It's a good thing you said that.  I had no clue.  I was picturing some place off of fucking Montauk.  Plum Island.  Plum Island.  Remember Plum Island?  You're playing the Plum Island fucking animal disease.  Under SWAT team surveillance, of course.  I'm going to be playing Fire Island and Milking Guys. 
[02:43:30]  Cherry Grove.  I'll be at the Empty Tampa Improv this weekend.  You're at the Tampa Improv this weekend.  Empty.  Why?  Why?  Because it's a big cavernous room and it's going to be empty.  It's actually three floors.  I know.  It'll be empty.  It's like where Lincoln got shot.  And it's got two stages.  It's a gorgeous room, but it's a fucking big one.  It's a big one.  And it's in Ybor City, which is fucking after 10 o'clock on a Friday or Saturday,  you have to be escorted back to your house by the police. 
[02:44:00]  Really?  They got fucking...  The cops there wear just the badge and no shirt and just tight jeans with a fucking gun.  It's all like bad boys.  It's pretty crazy.  Yeah, be careful.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll be right back.  Don't go anywhere.  Yeah.  We now return to the worldwide broadcast of the Obey and Anthony Show.  Uh, okay.  What the virus?  What the virus?  It's XM. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, I like that.  I was invited to come on with it.  You've lived together for a while.  We've got a lot of good co-stars.  Hi, everyone.  Obey and Anthony Show.  Obey's still sick.  Sickly.  Sickly.  So we're here.  Got Otto and Bob Kelly.  Tired.  And, of course, Jimmy Norton.  Yes.  Jimmy Norton.  Back from the left coast. 
[02:45:00]  Yes.  Fantastic.  Fantastic.  Uh, well, you know what I wanted to do?  Suck my cock?  No, I wanted to, um, to take a phone call.  Oh, yay.  You know what?  I really did.  Uh, let's check out, um, uh, ECW Zombie from Staten Island.  All right.  I love the phones. 
[02:45:30]  Hi, sir.  First is just the quality of the call.  It's great.  What's he doing?  The mechanical, logistic thing.  Fuck you.  Fuck your mother.  Does your phone work, sir?  All your mother's content.  That's great.  That's good.  Listen to it.  Let's just listen to this for a minute.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  That's great.  I just want to listen to this. 
[02:46:00]  I'm fascinated by it.  Does he know he's on the fucking air?  No.  Who knows?  Ah, goodbye.  How about, oh, well, you know who's always good?  Footer.  Let's go to Footer.  Hi, Footer.  Yo, what's up, boys?  I'm just holding on to listen.  I knew you weren't going to take calls, but if I do have to add anything to the show,  I'm just going to say E-Rock's a big, fat pig, and I'm punching out.  Waiter, boys.  Okay.  Wow. 
[02:46:30]  That was good.  Give him a tape.  That's a prime example of the shit.  You hate the callers?  I fucking hate the callers.  Let's try the next one.  Let's not let every bad apple spoil the bunch.  All right.  Let's go Mark in Philly.  Mark.  Hey, Anthony.  I'm just relaxing by the pool, listening on hold.  Congratulations. 
[02:47:00]  Congratulations, Mark.  You've won a DVD.  You've won a Blu-ray DVD of kick-ass.  Yeah, just keep talking over what I'm fucking saying.  You got mad.  You love it.  Don't go anywhere.  Stay on hold, because you won.  Okay.  You get a copy of kick-ass on Blu-ray.  What is kick-ass?  It's a great movie.  Nicholas Cage, boy.  Nicholas Cage and a little girl that curses.  Travis, get his address.  Courtesy of Lionsgate Home Video, which is one of D-Boy's favorite movie companies. 
[02:47:30]  Lionsgate.  Kick-ass.  And you won, because you were one of the worst fucking callers of the day.  We said off the air that the first caller who's horrendous is going to win a DVD.  Now, the first guy would have won, but he didn't pick up the phone.  Footer hung up.  Yeah.  You happen to stay on long enough.  So we got to get your address.  Yeah, so hold on, and we'll get your address and send that right out to you.  He lives in Philly?  Congratulations.  Is that any of your Wisecrackers at the Ramada Inn? 
[02:48:00]  Oh, it might.  In Allentown, PA, both nights, 9 p.m.?  It's very close.  It might be.  866-424-2411 for tickets.  Ottoandgeorge.com.  Ramada Inn, you motherfucking...  I'll be at the Jim and the other joint.  Yeah, I'll be at...  Yeah.  How about Chris from Florida?  Let's talk to Chris.  Hi, Chris.  Hey, Ed.  Jimmy, I heard you're in Tampa at the improv.  You got five shows.  I was looking for your recommendation as to which show I should go to. 
[02:48:30]  Who gives a fuck which show he goes to?  Just bring a lot of people.  It's a cavernous room.  Well, sometimes you get a bonus on Thursday for selling nothing on Saturday.  Whichever show you're available for when you're not watching, the Blu-ray you've just won.  Yes.  You want a Blu-ray copy of Cop Out on Blu-ray, directed by, of course, Kevin Smith.  It's got Bruce Willis, Tracy Morgan, and Jim Norton's in there.  It's courtesy of Warner Home Video, and you, my friend Chris from Florida, have won that 
[02:49:00]  DVD for sucking ass as a caller on this fucking program.  So hold on.  Hold on while we get your information.  There it is.  Do you want to know the weather that weekend, too?  What the fuck is...  You know which show's going to be good.  It's...  I can't...  There's got to be a good caller.  Explain to you how I hate the callers.  Hold on now.  Bobby said there might be a good caller.  There's got to be a one good caller.  Bobby's trying to take lemons and make lemonade.  Atta boy, Bob.  Is there a way to take another call while two people are on hold? 
[02:49:30]  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Now let's go to maybe, I guess, Norm in Queens.  Hi, Norm.  Norm.  Norm in Queens.  Maybe it's not Norm.  Anthony, can you hear me?  Anthony, can you hear me?  Yes, sir.  Yes.  Yes.  What's up?  Hey, I'm new to the show.  This is the first time I've ever called in.  You know about jailbreaking your phone? 
[02:50:00]  I was going to say that the reason why you do it, not to get those shitty cheap apps,  but you can do it in order to unlock certain things that AT&T makes it so you can't do.  For instance, tethering.  If you wanted to use your phone as a modem for your computer wirelessly through the Bluetooth,  connection, you could do that.  I remember.  You could use your laptop on the Internet.  Talking about this.  Yeah, we already had this morning.  I was trying to pull this morning. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Thank God.  You made it through now, though.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, and another thing.  And another thing?  How about you win a copy of Kick-Ass on Blu-ray, my friend?  That's right.  Kick-Ass on Blu-ray, courtesy of Lionsgate Home Video.  And that copy is going to you, sir.  Hang on while we get your information.  That's right.  Kick-Ass because your call sucked ass.  Oh, shut up.  Shut the fuck up. 
[02:51:00]  All right.  Let's go to Kurt Love from Brooklyn, of course.  Hey, Kurt Love.  I'm looking at his name over here.  I see it over here.  Kurt Love, how you doing?  Good morning, Opie.  When is Anthony going to be back?  I heard he was sick of something.  This guy's all right.  I'm not fucking...  I'm not dealing with a bit.  This is not a bit.  We got Norm.  We got that.  Let me randomly pick one.  I can't see what they want to talk about.  Right.  I don't have a board in front of me. 
[02:51:30]  So let me just take a guess.  All the phones are lit.  I'm going to guess...  It's five!  Pick up five!  Five.  Hi, sir.  You're on the air.  Who's this and where are you from?  Dan from Columbus.  Hi, Dan.  Dan from Columbus.  What do you want to add to the Opie and Anthony program this morning?  Honestly, guys, I've been listening for ten years.  And I just wanted to say that I love you guys. 
[02:52:00]  Well, you know what I want to say, sir?  What's that?  You're going to get a copy of Cop Out on Blu-ray.  Cop Out on Blu-ray.  Directed by Kevin Smith.  Starring Bruce Willis.  Tracy Morgan.  And, of course, the lovely and talented Jim Norton.  Courtesy of Warner Home Video.  You got that because your call sucked a fucking cock.  That's right.  Taking your call was a cop out to the entertainment world.  We copped out.  What do you want them to do? 
[02:52:30]  Anything.  Anything of substance.  So praise is not good.  No, no.  Praise is boring bullshit.  How about a thought that would get us to go like, wow, you know, that could start a conversation.  We converse with him.  He says something.  We go back.  A debate.  Something other than, you guys were.  I was just on hold.  I was on phone.  I love you guys punching out.  I was compelled to dial it.  Oh.  Yeah.  Just fucking useless. 
[02:53:00]  There's got to be something.  No, we're at seven.  Let's go to seven.  We'll try seven.  Hello.  Who's this?  And where are you from, sir?  This is Evan from New Hampshire.  Evan from the great state of New Hampshire.  Just give him the same day.  Live free.  Just give it to him.  Just give it to him.  Evan, anything you'd like to add to the program?  I just wanted to see if you guys saw the video, My PP, on YouTube.  And what is that?  YouTube.  It's silly. 
[02:53:30]  No, I know what YouTube is.  What's the video?  It's about my PP.  See, he's trying to call in Be Bad on Purpose.  No, no.  Do it.  I don't buy that.  Guy hanging up.  I don't fucking like the, on purpose, try to be that guy.  Exactly.  Just be yourselves.  It's awful.  Yeah, it's horrible enough.  You don't have to try so hard.  Yeah, but you guys are professional entertainers.  You're speaking to commoners.  Exactly.  You can't expect anything from them.  I know.  But they expect us to expect things from them.  Do you have to take calls legally or something? 
[02:54:00]  No, no, no.  That's why I never take calls.  But I've read some things, which I don't really put any credence in.  Does the suicide rate of the listeners go up if you don't call them?  It's like, why?  You know, I wonder why Anthony doesn't take calls.  I'm just actually just trying to make a point.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think it's blatantly obvious why I don't plunk the phone.  All kidding aside, let's take a good call.  Let's stop fudging around, excuse my French.  Someone has something to say.  Number two.  Let's go to number two.  All right, line two. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, your mother's crying out.  Hello, who is this and where are you from, sir?  Slippy in Florida.  Hey, what's up, buddy?  All right, what do you got for the show today?  I got two words for you, Anthony.  Choo-choo.  What?  Choo-choo.  You guys don't remember the choo-choo bit?  No, what the fuck are you talking about?  What?  Oh, my God.  Seriously?  What are you talking about?  What?  Explain it.  You guys had on the, when you were doing the guys being murdered by trains last week. 
[02:55:00]  And?  Choo-choo.  And we remember, stupid.  I said it.  Of course we remember, dummy.  And then he said it, and I pointed it out.  We're the two guys.  Yeah.  What the fuck do you think?  Hope his phone was cut off.  Oh, yes.  By a choo-choo.  By a fucking choo-choo.  Severing his fucking head head from his body body.  Oh, I hope he was fucking chained up by, like, a fucking villain in the 1920s. 
[02:55:30]  All right.  There has to be, um...  Sometimes you leave them on hold too long, they get nervous.  You should pick a fresh call.  All right.  Because sometimes when they're on hold too long, they're listening, they get fucked up and nervous.  Number five.  All right.  Number five is new, right?  We'll go to number five.  Go.  Hey, this is RJ from North Carolina.  Hey, man.  Hey, I went and saw Jimmy in Atlanta on Saturday night, and he killed. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah?  So, what, do you want to go on the air and talk about that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Hold on a second.  Hello?  RJ!  Hey, I went and saw Jimmy Saturday night.  He killed...  Hold on.  Hold on.  You're not on yet.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah.  I just want to let you know, uh, you're up next.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  RJ from North Carolina.  How you doing, man?  Hey, how you doing?  I went and saw Jimmy Saturday night in Atlanta. 
[02:56:30]  We're not ready.  Hold on.  We're recording.  We're not ready yet.  We're recording this for a later break, dude.  I'm sorry.  And, uh, we didn't have it running.  I'm sorry.  Fuck, man.  Shit.  Keep the energy up, though, okay?  All right.  All right.  I'm sorry, man.  All right.  Three, two, one.  RJ from North Carolina.  What's up, man?  Hey, I just wanted to, uh, call in.  Shut the fuck up. 
[02:57:00]  Are you honestly fucking this stupid?  Are you this fucking stupid?  Holy shit.  Do you listen to the show and know we just take calls and don't record them?  You dumb motherfucker.  I didn't, but Anthony, I didn't even hear what he was going to say.  He said Jimmy killed.  God, what an asshole.  RJ.  RJ.  RJ, what were you going to say?  For real.  He hung up.  Sheer embarrassment.  Kill yourself.  Jump off a bridge. 
[02:57:30]  RJ.  You're wasting a fucking life.  A real jerk off.  Oh, God.  Damn it.  Thank you.  Sheswick, stay off my side.  But sometimes they hang up on me, Mr. Hardy.  I don't want your phone topics or your phone topics.  Keep the energy level up.  But he did.  He did.  He came back.  Hey, hey.  I saw Jimmy.  Okay, okay, I'll wait.  I'll wait because I'm an idiot.  Oh, yikes.  There's got to be somebody.  There has to be. 
[02:58:00]  You can't.  I mean, they get the bit now.  They know what the hell's going on.  Someone is called up.  Why are you guys promoting that other movie that Jim's not in?  Oh, a kick-ass?  We're doing a promotion.  Yeah, Lionsgate Home Video has been kind enough to give us a couple of copies.  I guess they're gone.  Did we give out two kick-ass?  And I think two cop-out?  I think we got one more cop-out left.  Mmm.  Mmm.  All right, let's go to...  Did you go see that in the movies, Jim, when it was out?  I liked it.  It was good?  No, I didn't see cop-out. 
[02:58:30]  I saw that one.  You didn't go to see it in the movies?  I saw cop-out at Kevin's house.  You know how it is.  Oh, yeah?  You know how it is.  Just a private screening at Kevin's house.  That's cool.  Before there was any music or anything in it?  The music makes the movie.  Oh, so you saw a rough cut.  Real rough, yeah.  Yeah, the music makes the movie.  Who's in it?  Who's this?  Let's go to line numero...  Ah, shit.  Do nine.  Let's...  Nine.  Okay, go to nine.  Go to nine.  Spags in Allentown.  How you doing?  That is fucking good.  Fucking awesome, dude. 
[02:59:00]  I'm awesome.  I got nothing.  This is the best part.  I got nothing for the show, and I don't even want to give nothing, because it's worthless.  Please come to Wisecrackers.  Yo, I've been to that place.  It sucks.  It won't suck this weekend.  I'm there, man.  You're in Allentown.  Fuck a Ramana Inn.  You fucking suck.  Oh, I'm there, dude.  I'm there.  Yeah, please bring some of your fucking drunken friends.  Bring Jimmy Norton in Atlanta the other night, and he ruled.  You did not.  Shut up. 
[02:59:30]  I'm not even giving this guy a cop-out fucking shit.  No, without me.  No, right, no.  He tried that reverse fucking psychology.  I know.  Exactly.  All right.  How about line...  Oh, Brian in Arkansas, I guess, wants to say something.  Brian!  You Jew motherfucker.  Yeah.  You ever call my show again?  I'll kill you, you Jew motherfucker.  I just wanted to call up and say that I am an extreme, right-wing, conservative Christian,  and I wanted to thank you, gentlemen, for giving me something to laugh at every day 
[03:00:00]  that I could not laugh at in public, ever.  What does right-wing Christian mean to you, Brian?  Abortions?  Well, no, no, no.  Not quite that far right-wing.  But, you know, you all...  You hate the niggers and the Jews, don't you?  You hate the...  Oh, no, no.  ...the Jew judges and the nigger police up in New York way.  And the Guinea DAs.  And the faggots, milking faggots with my mouth.  I am Christ killers and porch monkeys.  I am a staunch, conservative, Republican, Christian, and I don't like abortions. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Asshole is a goddamn exit.  Yeah.  Deliverance was not a documentary.  Not Adam and Steve.  Get it?  Get it?  Homosexual.  God hates fags.  I do.  Sounds pretty familiar.  Yeah.  Ha-ha-da-da-da-na-arkin-sass.  Every day, because I try and repeat a joke of yours, and everyone looks at me like I'm  a horrible individual.  Stop doing it in church. 
[03:01:00]  He's in church all the time.  Yeah.  Fucking making bombs for abortion clinics.  Yes.  You fucking loony.  Excuse me, pastor.  Did you ever hear a queef?  Yeah.  Then Jimmy goes, she shit on my chest.  You get it?  Well, thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Go molest some children.  What was your favorite Smokey and the Bandit movie?  Was he off the air?  Some bitch.  Some bitch.  The one where he drives the Trans Am.  Oh, yeah.  Awesome.  Gentlemen, have a great day.  I appreciate it.  Thank you, Brian.  Thank you for all you do, guys. 
[03:01:30]  Thank you.  Actually, Gage.  Gage is from Arkansas.  My favorite porn star.  Gage.  Yeah?  Who are the kids who got killed in front of a pet cemetery?  Yeah.  Is that your favorite porn star?  Mine too.  A little flattened tiny.  Stupid little Gage.  Exactly.  And the stupid parents not watching porn.  Oh, and that great trucker.  Fucking squash that little fucking kid.  I want to say congratulations.  I have a congratulations shout out. 
[03:02:00]  I'm doing a shout out of congratulations to a friend of mine.  I'm not going to say who it is or anything, but I have a lot of friends in law enforcement  who got to experience his first tasering of somebody.  Oh, that was a fun.  Over the weekend.  Over the weekend.  Very, very happy.  First tasering.  Some Irish guy from Southie.  Boston fucking head.  Oh, Jesus.  And just being belligerent out in front of a bar.  Guy decides he's going to take a few fucking shots at one of the officers when he's got 
[03:02:30]  one hand behind his back with the cuff on it, trying to get the other cuff on.  Wham!  He comes around, slams one of the cops.  They try to subdue him.  Slams the cop two more times.  This officer backs off a few feet.  Pulls the taser out for the first time.  And the guy had like a jersey on that was pulled over his head a little bit from the other  cop.  So both barbs went into bare skin.  He looked like one of those blow-up things in front of a car place. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Apparently he just tensed up and fell right over and just laid there for a few.  Do cops try that on themselves just to know how...  Yeah, there have been cops that do that.  I think a lot of them have to trust it on themselves.  They have to get maced.  It's like one of those things where they get tased.  I don't know if it's mandatory in every state or anything.  It's a lot of voltage, isn't it?  Yeah, it's a hell of a lot of voltage.  And it just laid the guy out.  I got one this big that's on a nine-volt battery that will fucking drop you.  Never mind a gun. 
[03:03:30]  The rumor has it he tried to get up again.  Really?  And he gave him another shot while he was laying on the ground because he tried to get up again.  Sure he did.  Yeah.  He tried to get up again.  He was probably trying to breathe.  You've got to respect a guy from Southie taking a swing at a cop with one handcuff on him.  Oh, fucking Irish Southie drunk.  Wow.  Fuck you.  Fuck you, officer.  Fuck you.  You know my father, you fucking cocksucker.  Fucking piece of shit cocksucker.  Go ahead, fucking dude. 
[03:04:00]  Fucking hit me, kid.  I don't give a fuck.  You're not a fucking cop.  Because of the altercation, there had been a fuckload of people outside.  You know his girlfriend was just going, Sully, shut the fuck up.  Shut up.  They're going to tase you, you dumb cocksucker.  It hurts wicked bad.  Fuck you.  Dude, they're tasing Sully down the street right now.  Ah, fuck.  Ah, fuck.  I told that cocksucker to shut his fucking pile.  He's so many clock in Arizona.  He's fucking nice.  Yeah, once he go up there and have some tea parties or something. 
[03:04:30]  Oh, fuck.  I wish I had a taser right now.  Yeah, that's...  Does he have to do a lot of paperwork after that?  It all depends.  It's not like firing a gun, right?  Hold on.  Do you have a DVD for worst question or word?  No.  How long did they plug it in for?  I mean, do you get yelled at?  Boo.  Was it daytime or nighttime?  Nighttime.  Apparently, whoever fires the taser, that person's boss has to do all the paperwork. 
[03:05:00]  Oh.  That's crazy.  So you never want the guy below you to fire the taser, because then you've got to do the  paperwork.  But if you fire it, then the guy above you has got to do the paperwork.  Oh.  Yeah.  That seems to be how it works.  I developed a nervous twitch from Norton attacking me.  Oh, shit.  I'm not attacking you.  I'm just giving you little kisses.  It was just funny, though, because there's a great taser shit, the pants story.  How many pages of paperwork would that be? 
[03:05:30]  I don't know.  I don't know.  I came all over this girl's face.  Really?  What did she have for lunch?  I don't know.  With the eggs poached.  What happened to the groceries?  Yeah.  David from Israel.  Wow.  What?  We've talked to David from Israel, I think, right?  David?  Wasn't he in return?  A couple of times, and you poked on me, and that was fine.  Stop using Otto's word.  Otto just had poked on me, and you stole it and used it for yourself. 
[03:06:00]  Of course he did.  David?  How is Israel?  Where are you?  We forgot.  Tel Aviv?  Where are you?  Jerusalem.  Jerusalem?  Why don't you leave?  Yeah.  Hop on a bus.  Why don't I leave?  Because the money here is better than the U.S. right now.  That's why I'm living here.  Of course.  Yeah.  Better be better.  I'm Jewish.  What do you expect?  Take your testicles out of the top drawer and speak like a man.  We don't like your breathy woman's voice.  It's bothering everyone.  What do you do for a living over there?  Yeah. 
[03:06:30]  Telecommunications.  Telecommunications?  Aren't you worried about being blown to bits?  The last time that I saw a bombing here was 11 years ago.  The people, when you call, do they always say, hello, 50-year-old lady from Long Island?  Oh, no.  They just say, hello, ma'am.  It annoys me.  And in fact, I think it was when you guys first came on XM, Anthony ripped on me for about  10 minutes for my voice.  God, if you're up there, send a missile through the window and kill this fucking hermaphrodite.  Please. 
[03:07:00]  If you're up there, send a missile.  How old are you?  How old are you, dude?  28.  You're 28?  Yep.  Do you have like a patchy beard that doesn't connect?  No, not really.  Are you of Jewish descent?  Yeah, I'm Jewish.  You have payers?  Nope.  You believe in Jesus?  They don't pay nobody.  Do you wear a yarmulke?  You have a yarmulke on right now?  Yeah, I do.  Oh, you do.  Does everybody in Israel just walk around with a yarmulke? 
[03:07:30]  No, just the religious people do.  Hey, what's the little, on the Ascidic Jews, what are those little ropes hanging off  them, their belt, those little catfish things?  What is that?  What, the things with the strings?  Yeah, what are the little strings for?  If you pull that, does a prize come out?  What's on that?  Is that the wallet?  Is that how many wallets they have?  That's so good God can bungee jump.  What is that?  Two Jews walk into a bar.  They own it. 
[03:08:00]  I have a question for Jimmy.  What's the strings?  Tell me the strings, you motherfucker!  You Jew motherfucking you!  Don't make me pop your fucking eye out!  You fucking cocksucker!  What are those fucking strings for?  Wait, Henry, what kind of fucking people are they?  What are the strings?  What are the strings?  You got wearing a fucking ascot, you smoking with a fucking cigarette holder, and I'm out  of control?  You got the fucking strings hanging out of your head?  You motherfucker! 
[03:08:30]  He really thinks who the fuck he is, doesn't he?  What are they fucking parachute core, you cocksucker?  You star a David, shoot out!  You only exist because of me!  My David.  David?  Yeah, Jimmy, you had a quick question.  What the fuck are the strings?  You got no question!  You got answers!  I'm in a bad spot here, Frankie.  I really fucked up with this broad. 
[03:09:00]  Ben's a Jewish guy, he sounds like a broad.  Suitcase keeps getting smaller and smaller.  I just want to know.  All right, what's the strings?  I just want to know.  Is Bobby fucking a Jew's question?  That's no good, it's bad for business.  Bad for business.  They found a head in the desert.  Keep an eye on him.  Keep an eye on him.  He makes money.  Yeah.  Keep an eye on him.  I love that guy.  He's making money for us, yeah.  He's making money for us. 
[03:09:30]  The strings, the strings, David.  What's the strings?  You're a good girl, David.  It's some religious thingy that back in the day if you had a...  Charlie M!  You make me...  You make me pull the strings off your belt for Charlie M!  You talk like a woman on the phone for Charlie M!  So what are the strings?  You know, you're a degenerate. 
[03:10:00]  Now you're going to take this money and you're going to go buy new strings.  Yeah, your fucking lights are off.  Your wife had to call me.  Hey, Spider, but it was really you.  I thought it was your wife.  Yeah, let me find out how you gambled it.  I'll fucking leave you where I find you.  Sorry, sir.  Go ahead.  What were you saying?  Okay.  So the tic-tic, it's a religious garment.  If a garment has four corners, I have to have some kind of strings on it.  I don't know everything about it.  That's why...  What the fuck?  I can't get a ring and burst.  I can't go on.  All these chips just come out of my own fucking pocket.  Back and forth. 
[03:10:30]  Back and forth.  Dude, you got strings, dude.  And then this guy smoked my cigarettes, dude.  He's got...  So if it has four corners, you had to need strings.  The fuck does that mean?  Who came up with that?  What fucking pair of pants has four corners?  Something that was passed down from a long time ago.  You're a shit-kicker.  Yeah.  Get you.  Yeah.  All right, Jimmy.  Yes, sir.  I always hear you shitting yourself on the radio.  I saw you in the stress factory about eight months ago, and you killed. 
[03:11:00]  I was just curious, why do you constantly shit on yourself and think you're nothing when  you have a crowd, a packed-out crowd, and you're killing everybody that liked you?  Thank you, sir.  Oh, boy.  Um, well, sir, low self-esteem is not based on how many people are in the audience.  Oh.  My self-esteem was based on a lot of other things.  See, full house does not compensate for lost erection in the middle of sex.  Now put that in your fucking strings and smoke it. 
[03:11:30]  Ah, shit.  Thank you, David.  Thank you, David.  Let's go to Ed in Ohio.  Frankus!  All right, a little...  Frankus?  Frankus!  Ed from Ohio.  How are you, sir?  I'm good.  Morning, boys.  How you doing?  Hi.  I listen to the show every day, and yesterday kind of irked me when, Anthony, you guys were  talking to the intern, and you did your own for chase work for giving him hell about being  30-something years old, going back to school. 
[03:12:00]  You, uh, you, uh, and if you forget that, uh, Anthony, you weren't a spring chicken when  your career was handed to you on a silver flag.  Yep.  Go fuck your mother's asshole.  Oh, your mother's cut now!  Let me tell you something, Ed.  Let me tell you something, Ed.  Yeah, I didn't fucking sit there and go to school at fucking 31.  Not that that's a bad thing if you want to, but I didn't want to fucking do it.  And if somebody else wants to, I'm going to make fun of it.  Because him, a 31-year-old guy in college looks silly.  He really does. 
[03:12:30]  That's what I said.  That's what I meant.  I didn't forget where I came from.  And no career was handed to me, butt fuck.  I fucking earned it.  I was able to fucking perform.  I was able to perform.  We put you on the fucking radio, motherfucker.  See if you can hit number one, you cunt.  I did!  You called in the Opie show and doing a couple funny voices the same time.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  I called a show and gave entertainment, dummy.  I didn't call up with fucking nothing. 
[03:13:00]  Do you understand that?  You glum cunt.  Is that what Mel called her?  You never, uh, you didn't have to pay no dues.  You know what I mean?  I didn't have to pay those dues.  Sure, he's right, though.  He is right.  I've been doing this shit.  Otto's paid dues.  I've been doing this shit for many, many years.  As long as your mother's been fucking a whore.  She's been a fucking whore.  I couldn't even spit that out.  I wasn't about that one day.  Shut up, Ed.  You live in Ohio. 
[03:13:30]  Blow me.  Yeah.  Anyway, on another note, Bob, Bobby Kelly saw you in Columbus a couple weeks ago.  You were a gay man.  Thank you, brother.  I appreciate it.  Thanks, everybody.  Don't thank him.  Just paying my dues, man.  Nasty Joe and then he's complimenting you to Bobby.  This guy's an asshole.  Jerk off.  Handed it to me on a silver platter.  A gold platter, my friend.  It's all gold now.  Yeah.  That's right.  But it was paid for by the listeners.  Don't forget that.  Shut up.  It was not.  It was paid for with my wonderful talent. 
[03:14:00]  Anyway, boy.  All right.  Take it easy, Ed.  Don't take no shit off nobody.  Don't fuck your mother.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  You didn't mean that.  Fuck your father.  Crawl up, pull his dick between his legs backwards, and milk your father.  Exactly.  Milk him into your mouth.  While he pinches his nipples, it's just fucking harder.  Use your two thumbs and stroke his vein.  What would you do if you walked in and saw your dad with his dick between his legs being a girl? 
[03:14:30]  Oh, God.  The image.  My girlfriend hates when I do vagina boy.  When I put my dick back and I tell her to lick my pussy.  Oh, you tuck?  And then I make her lick the little fatty pubes.  No, you don't.  Oh, yes, I do.  Does she?  She hates it.  But she'll do it just so I pop my dick back out.  I do that, but I don't trim my bush fat, so I look like my aunt.  It's just a fat gut, like a bunt.  With a big bush?  Yeah, I have a fucking bunt. 
[03:15:00]  Is your aunt fat?  Yeah, all aunts are fat.  You can't tuck if you're fat.  It just looks silly.  You can tuck, but you have just a little bit sticking out, just the top of the shaft.  It can't get it all back.  It looks like you've got camel toe, because the fat's going around your dick shaft.  Triangle clit.  Bend backwards.  Triangle clit.  I don't even know what that is.  I don't know.  Well, the phones worked out really well.  They were good.  I like that.  We should next maybe read some instant feedback and see the humor that's coming in off of that. 
[03:15:30]  Let's see.  Do we have any good ones?  Dan?  Let's see.  I won't be ignored, Dan.  This dude's voice sounds like Seinfeld's fake voice when he pretends to be Rafe when trying  to find out the tractor story from his one girlfriend.  Oh.  Okay.  Brilliant.  That's a good one.  Aw, I was hoping it was Sandy Kane they tased. 
[03:16:00]  Holy shit.  That creature's still living?  Oh, God.  Yeah, unfortunately.  She really got pissed last time she was here.  How does she exist?  I mean, does she does comedy?  She's doing the naked cowgirl now, which she's being sued for by the naked cowboy.  Oh, boy.  She goes into Times Square, wears a cowboy hat, and a bikini bottom, and pasties.  The Fantastics closed, but she's still fucking working.  The Fantastics.  And she has people take pictures with her, and they give her money like they do the naked 
[03:16:30]  cowboy.  But she's got like an injunction now against her.  She's not allowed to do it, but she's doing it anyway.  So we had her come in and talk to the naked cowboy on the phone.  Oh, okay.  And they got into it a little bit.  And then she got all pissed.  She wanted to get paid for the appearance.  And then somebody perhaps might have misplaced her hat, her little cowboy hat that she wears  out there.  So she got very angry, left some nasty fucking voicemails.  Wow.  Nasty.  Travis has the voicemails.  Travis, could you play an example of the voicemail? 
[03:17:00]  Because listen to this.  This woman is fucking insane.  I had to work a weekend with her in Albany at the comedy works.  Oh, that must have been a nightmare.  Disgusting.  Did she come in your mouth?  No, she fucking left cunt hairs on the stool.  No.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Yeah, chips went up there and went, blowing the cunt hairs into the audience.  Remember the time we got snowbound up there in fucking Albany?  We were snowbound at the fucking Days Inn.  Oh, my God.  That's real.  Remember Boog Powell was there?  How long were we up there for? 
[03:17:30]  I love some of the names Otto comes up with.  Boog Powell was a fucking...  You were the one who spotted him.  We were snowbound from like...  It started snowing on Friday.  They canceled the second show.  We were trapped there until like Monday.  Oh, shit.  I vaguely remember that.  The snow was halfway up the side of the hotel.  Was it Albany or Buffalo?  It was the Albany room, the comedy works.  I like the room.  Yeah, he was definitely with me.  Did you just snuggle with each other for the whole week?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It was like The Shining.  It was an empty, freaky hotel. 
[03:18:00]  The cook.  Cuddling?  Yeah, yeah.  Boog Powell was there.  And then after like three days of eating and drinking for free, he wanted to charge the  cook for an autograph.  I thought he was a fucking jerk-off after that.  Yeah.  The cook wanted his autograph.  He goes, yeah, 50 bucks or some shit.  For an autograph?  Yeah.  Probably wanted him to sign a ball.  Fucking tool.  But he was up there for an autograph convention.  But come on.  He ate for free for three fucking days.  Motherfucker.  Yeah.  Travis.  You don't remember that, Jim?  Oh, well. 
[03:18:30]  Clunk down, stupid Sandy Kane.  Let me hear this.  You know, Steve, it's a Tuesday night.  I just came in.  You know, being Britney Spears and all that bullshit, I left my fucking hat up at the studio.  And it's Tuesday night.  And it's Tuesday night.  We did it Monday morning.  And I'm first realizing that I don't have my fucking hat.  Because, you know, it just, it really threw me.  I couldn't, of course, I couldn't do that Dutch interview.  They were all out there.  And I had to stand them up.  And my fucking hat, which I need to work, is gone. 
[03:19:00]  And probably your stupid interns, your Sam Roberts and your Danny probably stole it.  They had my stuff all over the floor.  I mean, my blue wig.  They had all my stuff fucking on the floor, disgusting.  And then they probably stole the hat.  Somebody could have called and said, well, you left your hat here.  You know I need that to work, to make a living.  You know, and you guys have absolutely no feelings for me. 
[03:19:30]  You know better than the naked cowboy.  And you were.  You know, I did that was backwards for you.  I did that.  And I didn't make money on Monday.  You know, for your stupid makeup artist.  She got shit all in my eyes.  My eyes were burning all day.  She threw away my eyelashes.  I had to go today, buy new eyelashes.  And I don't have my fucking hat.  Now, how would you like it, Steve, if people treated you like you treat me? 
[03:20:00]  I don't have my fucking hat.  Now, I hope you have it up there.  Because I want to pick it up.  Now, it would be so good to call me tomorrow, not too early.  I'm going to try to go out to work.  Don't have my hat to work with.  Be considerate enough to give me a call and tell me when I can pick my hat up if Sam or Danny haven't stolen it.  Thank you.  You know my number.  You know what I'm noticing about that call? 
[03:20:30]  Yeah.  Is that when she's leaving that message, she says that she was in Monday and it's Tuesday night and she's just realizing that she doesn't have her hat.  So, she didn't even know what the deal was with the hat.  She just basically forgot it here, assumed that we were going to fuck with it.  Yeah.  And then left a nasty message because she forgot her dumb hat.  And if she didn't leave the nasty message, we wouldn't have fucked with it.  But because of that call, that hat went down to the fucking rifle range.  Is that the only one?  Yeah, it's a fucking big important hat. 
[03:21:00]  Went down to the rifle range and got quite a few holes put in it.  Poor Sandy.  You want the other voicemails or do you want to stop?  Nah, it's good.  That kind of explained it all right about there, didn't it?  I thought she was threatening people's lives, didn't it?  I don't know.  I'm trying to look for the sheet with the thing on it with all the stuff.  What sheet?  Is there any fun stuff that we should probably listen to? 
[03:21:30]  Let's see.  Oh, you want audio stuff?  Yeah, why not?  You want the they be raping everybody auto-tuned?  Yes.  No, I don't know if I want that.  What is that?  You remember that news story from the other day where that weird black guy,  that he was kind of effeminate and he was saying that they'd be raping everybody up in here?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was the same guys that did the double rainbow guy auto-tune.  Did they be raping?  Yeah, well, it's the auto-tune the news fellas.  I want to hear that. 
[03:22:00]  It's a quick one.  We'll hear that.  It's no big deal.  But yeah, that was a really good story.  It's all over the place.  Everybody knows this guy.  Take a listen.  Well, obviously, we have a rapist in Lincoln Park.  He's clamming in your windows.  He's snatching your people off.  Trying to rape him.  So y'all need to hide your kids.  Hide your wife.  Hide your kids.  Hide your wife.  Hide your kids.  Hide your wife.  Can't hide your husband.  Because they're raping everybody out here.  You don't have a call.  They confess.  We're looking for you. 
[03:22:30]  We're going to find you.  We're going to find you.  So you can run and tell.  I'm not digging this.  I'm not digging it.  It's just stupid.  Yeah.  It's so hit and miss with the internet.  You never know what's going to be awesome.  And it's usually miss.  Send it to fucking Z100.  Yeah, but you know what?  It's all over the place.  It should be.  On the floor.  It's doing better than Double Rainbow Guy.  Didn't Weird Al Yankovic fucking do a parody of that?  Did he?  Yeah.  Weird Al Yankovic.  He's funny.  Yeah.  Of what? 
[03:23:00]  White and nerdy.  I like the original story.  Yeah, that's what that was.  It was just a news story that they auto-tune.  Yeah.  White and nerdy.  Some people like that.  Some people, you know.  I like the Double Rainbow one.  That was good.  That one, I couldn't really understand what the guy was saying.  Like Double Rainbow, the guy's very concise.  That guy, you couldn't understand him even not auto-tune.  All right.  Well, fuck you then.  No, no.  Nothing personal, Danny.  Yeah.  If you want, we could do Maggot Found in Teens Eye. 
[03:23:30]  I got one.  Okay.  We don't drink.  We don't smoke.  Nor fuck.  Nor fuck.  What?  I have no idea what that was.  I like it.  What's happening now?  What's up?  What's up?  Well, you know, last time Bobby was in...  I just got that.  Oh, fuck.  We were talking about that Monsters Inside Me show.  And I guess the news is picking up on it and how creepy it is.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  So, yeah, they're starting to do some reports on it.  And I guess this is one of the episodes.  I don't know if it aired or if it's coming up or whatever, but apparently there was a maggot 
[03:24:00]  in some kid's eye.  Why couldn't they get it out with drops?  Yeah, what?  You weren't there for that, right, James?  When they're talking about this?  You should see that fly video where they take like a fly larva out of some chick's head.  It's so fucking sick.  It really is.  It really is disgusting.  If you go to Belize, these flies lay...  They literally lay eggs on your head and then the maggots are under your skin just feeding.  And they grow.  And you can feel them and hear them in your head.  You hear them scraping on your skull.  And the only way to get them out is by closing the hole and suffocating them. 
[03:24:30]  And then you pull them out because the hole is how they breathe.  Oh, wow.  How long did it take for them to die?  Seven years.  No, I'm kidding.  You just put...  It takes a couple days.  They pulled it out with a tweezer and fucking at the end of it was pus.  It came out of the hole.  It went like...  And then out of the hole dribbled like a cream pie.  This fucking green pus came fucking dripping out of it.  I see it.  But you don't know.  It's big. 
[03:25:00]  You can't see how big it's...  The tail is thin and small.  It looks like a little worm.  When you pull it out, it just gets bigger and bigger where it's been feeding.  And on your fucking juices.  Yeah, yeah.  So the last bit of it is just this...  Like, she was going, ow!  What are you supposed to do?  Fly out when it's done?  It's a fly larva?  Yeah, it fucking turns into a fly and fucking flies out of your head.  So why kill it?  Just leave it there until it goes away.  No, I think...  You sick fuck.  The fly can't get off.  Because you can't sleep.  You hear it going...  I love to see that fat Andrew Zimmerman eat one of those on Bizarre Food. 
[03:25:30]  God damn it, I can't look.  Oh, it's secreting waste.  It's shitting out of his head.  Leave a dead cat and get it.  That's puss.  I can't look.  Secreting waste.  The fly taking a dump out of your head.  Puss really fucking is disgusting.  Puss is disgusting.  It's one...  There you go, there you go.  See, it's little, little, little, little.  No, no, no, I'm not going to watch this.  Oh, wow, yeah.  I can't watch it.  How does Bobby watch this?  Watch how big it gets.  No.  Oh, that's long.  Where is that?  In someone's fucking head? 
[03:26:00]  It's in their head.  Look at that.  Ew.  It's in your fucking head.  What, they eat at Arby's?  How big it...  Look at the trail of...  God fucking damn it.  Is that thing dead or alive?  It's alive.  No, it's dead.  It has to be dead to pull it out.  Yeah.  If it's alive, they grip on the inside of your head.  They hang on, so you have to kill it by covering the hole.  He has another one there, too, in his arm.  This guy's got flies all over him.  Why doesn't he fucking relax?  Quit putting jelly on his arms before bed. 
[03:26:30]  This guy's been spreading jelly on himself.  I thought I'd keep the flies away.  Squeeze some lemon juice in there.  Oh, he's got the next two.  This guy's fucking...  He's covered in fly lardy.  This guy's fly McGillicuddy.  People tape and fucking watch everything now.  Yeah, there's nothing you can't see.  There you go.  Look at that one.  Where's that coming out of?  The Lansing boils.  Is that his...  No.  And shit.  Oh.  Oh, God.  I can't watch that.  Get that fucking...  Ah, God.  They fucking drop flies all over this fucking guy. 
[03:27:00]  It's so nauseating.  It's like a fly city.  Oh, God.  That's a long baby.  Wow.  Hey.  You make me pop that larva out of your head for Charlie M?  Exactly.  You let a fly lay an egg for Jeff Goldblum?  That's huge.  What is that thing?  It's a fucking...  It's a fucking fly, baby.  But flies are way smaller than that.  Not inside when they're feet on your...  Why is he paying it with a dime?  He put a dime next to it.  What's he giving the fucking larvae a dime?  Go start a life for yourself.  What is that, Canadian? 
[03:27:30]  I mean, it's worthless.  Yeah, that is disgusting.  This guy's got flies all in him.  Shit.  Yeah.  Fuck.  I can't.  But, yeah, anything you think you can see, you can see.  You can totally see it online.  Yeah.  Wait.  There's another one.  Ah, shit.  Oh, look.  Another one.  Look at all the pus.  What's with the pus?  Enough with the pus.  Oh, wait.  They pop up to breathe and they die?  They breathe out of the hole.  But wait, what do they put?  Fucking Vaseline on it?  They put... 
[03:28:00]  You can put a wax on it or...  A piece of tape.  But wait, if it grips, does it hurt?  Yeah.  Yeah, you can't pull it out.  It won't leave.  It's attached in there.  You know, Obama's been to the oil spill in New Mexico three times this summer.  You know, it's summertime.  He wants to be darker.  What do you think of that joke?  You don't think they do good with that?  It's summertime.  He wants to be darker, too.  Okay.  Fucking cake. 
[03:28:30]  I can't write for shit.  If I don't say cunt, I don't get a laugh.  I'll fucking throw cunt in there.  Your mother's cunt.  I got this joke I've been trying out on stage.  I'll go up there and I'll go look at this oil spill.  Why don't you just put your car in the ocean and get all the oil you need?  Fucking black people get...  Beautiful.  Chip.  Fucking black people get really rigid when I bring up the president now.  They go, okay, what is it?  Oh, really?  Like, where's he going with this?  They're ready to fight.  It's like, he's my president, too.  Fuck you.  He's white and black. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah.  Fuck you.  Nah.  You know...  Has your life changed one fucking iota because there's a spook in the White House?  You don't give a shit.  Jesus.  You have a horn?  Hey, hey.  I need this job.  Oh, okay.  And I don't have a dump button.  No, sorry.  Sorry.  I have...  Yes.  Person of color?  Exactly.  Whew.  Oh, that was frightening.  Wow.  It's like the old days.  Nah, just that isn't. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  Kind of a sensitive, touchy issue.  Congrats to Louis C.K.  Louis C.K., season two.  Season two, huh?  Yeah.  What, that show that's on FX?  Yeah.  Yeah, I've seen it.  It's pretty good.  And Bobby is on that show.  That was on last night.  It was on last night.  It was one of the...  Yeah, I'm on next week, too.  Just a small little piece.  Oh, that's cool.  Yeah?  Look at you.  What did you shoot at?  The comedy seller?  I thought...  No, just all over New York. 
[03:30:00]  You take a cab.  It's literally fucking the best gig ever.  You take a cab.  He makes you do it a bunch of times, and that's it.  You're done.  There's like no budget, right?  No budget.  No budget.  It looks like a very inexpensive show.  Yeah, it's not like a regular...  You know, where you get cast.  I mean, he literally just calls people up and says you want to do it, which is great.  You don't have to fucking, you know, audition, audition, audition.  You know, Jim had to fucking audition for Lucky Louie, and randomly, he's lucky...  He went on tape in New York.  Randomly, Louie saw Jim on the tape. 
[03:30:30]  Usually, they don't even fucking look at those things.  You didn't know Louie C.K. before that?  No, he knew him.  That's the only reason I did the audition.  I never would do an audition on tape.  I just did that one because I'm like, oh, Louie's my buddy.  Yeah.  Usually, they just run...  They fast-forward through those fucking tapes.  Do you remember that, Bobby, when I was at your house and I was at Bobby's apartment?  Get ready to do that audition.  Yeah.  And he actually saw Jimmy.  He's like, oh, shit.  They were fast-forwarding.  They saw Jimmy.  Oh, let me watch it.  And then Jimmy got the part.  Wow.  See how that works?  It's wonderful.  Yeah, so...  And, yeah, he got picked up for another season.  Yep.  Another season, which is great. 
[03:31:00]  And he puts a lot of motherfuckers to work, too.  A lot of motherfuckers.  A lot of New York actors and comedians.  A little more Jimmy.  Oh, he was on the fucking best episode ever.  A little more.  He will be.  There'll be plenty of time.  Yeah.  On another one.  I do, too.  I'm sure it'll happen.  I did the Joy Behar show because of Jimmy.  How was that?  It was actually because of Jimmy.  Why?  That's what this business is, though.  Jimmy said really nice things about me.  You went on by yourself or with Opie, too?  I just went on.  I just went on there.  Every time he saw you on Letterman, you were the only one who talked. 
[03:31:30]  Opie didn't say a fucking thing.  It's a weird situation.  Yeah.  Because, first of all, the seating, you know?  Because the way the camera's looking at you.  But you're like the John Lennon.  I mean, you did all the talking.  He seemed...  I get very...  He was like, oh, look, this camera's like a dopey little fucking blonde-haired guy.  Oh, my God.  You were a chatty Cathy.  Yeah, you took control.  It was great.  Here's what happens.  The way the graphic is, and the way you look at it, it says Opie and Anthony.  So Opie's got to be to the left.  I got to be to the right. 
[03:32:00]  Here's what happens.  Or it's Anthony and Opie.  Oh.  So I'm sitting...  Hold on.  I'm sitting next to the host.  Yeah.  So I'm kind of close to the host talking.  Yeah, okay.  And then, when I get on, all I'm thinking is, I got to keep this going.  Yeah.  Make it count.  If there's a fucking minute, a minute, a fucking second of silence, that's something that could  have been thrown in.  Were you nervous?  Were you very nervous?  Yes!  Oh, my God.  I was standing in the wings waiting to go on, just fucking freaking out.  Because you have so much microphone time, but very little camera time, so you notice 
[03:32:30]  it's like being shoved out.  So it's like, shove out, sit down, and just bam, bam, bam, bam, let it go.  Very hard to get used to it.  Because even though, like, when you do a TV show like that, even though it's taped and  it airs later, it's still live, because whatever you do is what they're going to air.  That's what they're going to air.  It's still basically, you know, if you fuck up, they're going to show it.  And the audience is there, you know, you're fucking, yeah.  You suck.  Well, I consider that live, because when I did my set, it's like, if I go, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da,  you know, they don't airs that way set.  I find that, as long as you don't, excuse me. 
[03:33:00]  Oh, oh!  I'm sorry.  If you don't curse.  Bobby's blonde.  He literally touched the top of my cock.  So who was Ollie at?  I don't know.  It was two women.  One was blonde, and I think a comedian, but I'm not sure of her name.  Did you bring a gun with you?  And then I never really discuss where and when I carry my weaponry with me.  It would be nice to know you could kill everybody in the room, especially that show.  Holy shit! 
[03:33:30]  If you felt like it, you could just blow everyone's head off sitting there on the couch.  I don't think Otto could get a license.  You still look all right.  Bam!  Oh, shit!  Cunt thinks she's funny.  Holy shit!  If that show was on and I couldn't find my clicker and I had a handgun, I would blow  my fucking brains out rather than continue to watch that.  It was like, gun, clicker, can't find the clicker, bang! 
[03:34:00]  My life would be all over.  I wouldn't have to be at Wisecrackers at the Ramada Inn in Allentown this weekend.  Oh, and they gave away my fucking hotel room.  They said there's some fucking bowling convention going on.  So I got to drive back and forth to Allentown.  Wait, who gave away your room?  The hotel?  The fucking Scott Bruce.  He goes, I...  Is that the one we had the trouble with?  I'll never work that fucking room again.  That's the first thing he says to me.  I have some bad news.  There's no rooms in town.  There's some bowling fucking convention.  What?  I went, I'll drive back, but give me fuck. 
[03:34:30]  I want to be compensated for the inconvenience.  Yeah, I had a very bad experience in that place.  You did?  You went to a club in Reddick.  What?  It's got another club in Reddick.  Oh, it wasn't that one?  Yeah, I'm doing Allentown.  He's got a couple of different ones.  He ain't a bad guy, but fucking, you know, I was looking forward to, you know, staying  and fucking watching HBO.  I would never accept no room.  There's got to be a nearby town that could put you in a room in.  It's unacceptable.  I had so little work in July, and I got to get on stage because I haven't performed 
[03:35:00]  since that bomb in Montauk.  Oh, you got to get back on the horses, they say.  It's unacceptable.  Until I hear my next laugh, I feel like a fuck.  I still feel like a little piece of shit.  It's unacceptable.  I bet if you called the hotel right now in that area, if you called them, there'd be  a room available.  You should call a few hotels.  Absolutely fucking lose.  Yep.  I bet if you called right now a few hotels, there's guaranteed a room in that fucking...  Guaranteed.  Where is it?  Redding?  No, it's Allentown, PA.  Allentown.  Yeah.  So there's got to be...  Look around the towns right around it.  Like maybe 10 or 15 minutes away, you get something.  Did you have one of the interns do that just so I can fuck with Scott Bruce and call him 
[03:35:30]  a liar?  I'll fucking...  I'll cancel the gig.  I got money in the bank.  I don't give a fuck.  There you go.  Yeah.  A few bucks in the bank.  Easy come, easy go.  I used to do that.  I had it and I went with it.  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck that.  Yeah, no room is unacceptable.  It's not a long drive, though, from where I live, though.  It's not terrible, you know?  It's not over two hours.  I make them give me a room when I do Caroline's.  Oh.  No, I'm kidding.  Oh, you do?  You could, bro.  They would come and go, fuck myself. 
[03:36:00]  They would?  Oh, they'd piss on me.  Louis Fran, they would spit in my face.  I got a room when I did Letterman.  There was a snowstorm, but that was great, though.  I demand a room when I do the comedy cellar.  Sometimes, if you do live out of town, you do got to get a room, though, because I, like  yesterday, of course, George Behock.  See, I don't pick scabs anymore.  What hotel was you supposed to stay in?  Dying to rip this scab off.  Ow!  But I won't do it now, see? 
[03:36:30]  What'd you do?  I'm older and maturer now.  You're mature.  You won't rip that off?  I'm mature.  I want to rip this fucking thing off my arm.  What hotel?  The Ramada Inn.  Oh, yeah?  Hello, mother.  Here I am at Camp Ramada.  It's a Ramada, so it's pretty good.  That song always made me laugh.  Oh, hello, mother.  Hello, father.  I'm here at Camp Granada.  Here I am at Camp Granada.  Yeah.  They say we'll go outside.  If it stops raining, people laughed. 
[03:37:00]  Shut up.  He did a lot more than that.  Oh, shit.  Now you touched the nerve.  I got a box set of Alan Sherman.  He was funny.  You can't put him on the radio without telling him.  I just saw Danny pan.  I've never seen his hand flip out like that.  But you know why?  I don't have a dump button because fucking Eastside Dave, who's here once a week now on  Saturday, spilled water again in the fucking controls.  So I don't have a mic and I don't have a fucking dump button. 
[03:37:30]  I know.  So Travis has a dump button.  He can't use that area anymore then because that can get us fucking all right.  I know.  Oh, when you do.  Yeah, but I'm the one that goes like, you know, and the problem is, is that, you know,  there's not one over here by this main board.  So, like, let's say, let's say I say heck.  Let's say Travis is previewing something, you know, and he doesn't and he's not hearing  the live.  I didn't know.  Does that actually function?  I didn't know.  I'll reach over.  I'll smash that fucking thing.  You were fucking waving at me like fucking you were hailing a cabin. 
[03:38:00]  Well, because you can't put somebody on the air unless they know.  That's illegal.  Who are you talking to?  I didn't know that.  Who are you talking to?  That's almost as bad as calling a president.  Yeah, that's wicked illegal.  Who are you talking to?  The lady in Vermont.  Hey, you cunt.  Take that cock out.  She's on hold.  Yeah.  Fuck.  He's calling up.  He's going, uh, I need a room.  I saw a snail on the edge of a straight razor.  That's my dream. 
[03:38:30]  Hey, Colonel Curtis.  That's my nightmare.  Look at the motherfucker.  I smell a little bug.  Yeah.  I need a room.  A few clicks up the Nung River pile of tiny inoculated arms.  They wanted Steve McQueen to play the Martin Sheen role.  That would have been great.  Yeah.  Sheen was good, though, man.  Martin Sheen was good, but Steve McQueen, that would have been interesting.  He was a little, uh, I don't know.  Yeah.  A little too well-known at that point.  Too well-known to play that?  Yeah. 
[03:39:00]  Like Brando's not well-known?  No, no, the Brando part, but the Martin Sheen part was like, he was just some young fucking-  He needed some authenticity, yeah, I see what you mean.  Yeah, that might have taken me out of it a little bit.  Yeah.  Steve McQueen was fucking-  I saw that at the Zigg film, opening day.  It was a very anticipated film.  Yeah.  It was like his, you know, he hadn't done anything since Godfather 2.  It was fucking amazing.  Yeah.  That one-  They showed the whole film with no credits.  They didn't show Paramount Presents.  They didn't show Brando. 
[03:39:30]  Nobody's no credits at the beginning or the end.  They just ran the movie.  Just-  To make it feel like you were out, you saw war.  Yeah.  Like you were there.  It was one of those, like, groundbreaking movies, because it kind of changed the war movie,  especially the Vietnam war movie.  Oh, fuck, on a big screen?  Yeah.  That was unbelievable.  Because it showed how fucked up shit was.  Yeah.  Before that, everything was kind of cool.  Oh, yeah.  In war movies, everything.  The Americans were all these good guys.  Yeah, John Wayne.  Yeah.  They'd shoot him, and the German would fall down, and that one was just kind of like, 
[03:40:00]  wow, this is kind of fucked up.  And then Brando shows up fat, so that's why they only filmed his head.  He was supposed to be this tough, marine, 40-year guy living in the jungle, living off  the land, and he shows up, like, 600 pounds.  Giant.  He got nutty butty butters in his pockets, you know, and Coppola was really pissed, so  that's why they filmed him in the shadows and only his head.  I loved it, though.  I thought it worked.  It did work.  I mean, Brando's interesting at any weight, but he wasn't the guy that he was supposed 
[03:40:30]  to be.  He was supposed to be lean and mean in that.  Okay, thank you.  I'll call you right back.  Bobby's just making a business proposal.  They have 15 rooms available.  Are you kidding me?  The reason why you're not getting a room is because it's $219 a night.  Oh, hell.  So fucking Scott Bruce liked him.  Well, what happened was he's probably got a deal at the hotel for like, you know, 60  or 80 bucks, and then they said, I don't know. 
[03:41:00]  I would just ask him about it.  Do the gig and then just say, look, you know, you have, they had 50, yeah, she said she has  15 rooms.  But they might have canceled his room rate for that week because of the ball.  Yeah, they might have said, they might have fucked him out of the room, but.  Just don't put him on the radio if you're calling him.  I'd go just because of the chicks that'll probably be around for that bowling thing.  How far is the gig?  Is it under an hour, under two hours?  Yeah, it's under two hours.  Yeah, go on.  Yeah, sure.  Two there, two back, two there, two back.  It's only eight hours. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah, why would you need a bed?  Yeah, why would you want to put your little sweet head down?  Yeah.  Even if there's a room 15 minutes away, what are a couple adjoining towns?  You can get a room a couple of towns.  I don't give a shit about the room.  What the fuck is this?  He's pissed that he's fucking being bullshitted.  Otto feels like he wasn't dealt with fairly.  No.  Goodbye.  It's the first time.  And also, this guy's had comedy work for 25 years.  Suddenly, he wants to book me?  It's like, oh, thanks for the steady work.  When I left him a message, he goes, well, you implied that I've, uh, didn't, you, you. 
[03:42:00]  Hold on.  I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what probably happened.  You ready?  That's livid.  Hold on.  I want to see what.  I ran out of thoughts.  I'm so tired.  Oh, no.  Poor Jimmy.  I'm exhausted, too.  Jimmy's sleepy.  I'm tired.  Yeah.  Wow.  And what are you fucking, like, flying out again?  Tomorrow afternoon.  Yeah?  I'm doing, you know, we're plugging the shit out of the show.  They called.  Hold on.  Don't leave the room.  We want to hear this.  They called the fucking Ramada Inn.  They said they got 15 rooms available there. 
[03:42:30]  Hmm.  15.  They called the Ramada Inn in Allentown.  They said they have 15 rooms available.  Talking to Grandpa?  They said they have 15 rooms available.  Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  Can you hear me, Grandpa?  I know.  I don't give a shit.  We're just fucking, we're fucking with you.  That's all.  No, but that's the truth.  They have 15 rooms available.  If it's, if it's, if it's, I just, you know, I just want to be compensated for the inconvenience of driving back.  Make sure your son, you know, has some extra money for, you know, to drive back and forth. 
[03:43:00]  Otto does not get that room.  It'll make him a big star.  It's perfect for him.  It's got coffee maker and a little kitchenette.  But don't call me back as a moneyer.  It'll make him feel comfy and cozy.  You don't, well, if you get satellite.  What are you on the internet?  What?  If you wanted to hear the show on the internet.  www.getmearoommotherfucker.com 
[03:43:30]  He said, www.getmearoommotherfucker.com  I don't know, I'll be in Anthony, I guess.  I'll see a search for it.  It'll turn up somewhere.  We've got a lot of good plugs in so far.  He should get you a room in a nearby town.  Some fucking guy called who lives in Allentown.  I said, you better fucking show up.  Douche.  Scott, Scott Bruce, he's a good guy.  Get him a room.  He's got 15 fucking rooms available.  Get him a fucking room.  You deserve a room.  I'm like a gentleman.  He's got to do a gig like a gentleman.  You're fucking 35 years in this business.  You deserve a room.  Yeah.  You need like a piece of shit over me. 
[03:44:00]  Come on.  Come on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  You know something?  He's the big guy, right?  The big Italian guy?  No, no.  What are you doing?  Not at all.  He's adjusting his dick.  My schmeckle.  He's adjusting his dick.  Dicks have to be adjusted every so often.  Is that the guy from the comedy works?  No.  No, you're thinking of Tom Nicky.  Yeah.  No, Scott Brooks.  Yes.  I like Tom.  He's a good guy.  I like him.  Tom's a good dude.  Older guy, gray hair.  He's all right, though.  Nice guy.  Why don't we get our respective plugs in? 
[03:44:30]  Fuck yeah.  And that way I can go.  I'm in Atlantic City with Jim Florentine at the end of August at the showboat.  The showboat with Florentine.  August 30th or 29th, something like that.  We're doing the showboat.  It's a good gig.  I don't even know.  Yeah.  Levy, me, Florentine.  It's me and Otto and George.  Relax.  It's a good time.  We're going to have a good time.  Truthfully, get there early.  I'm sponsored by Wishbone.  Blue cheese now. 
[03:45:00]  Jimmy?  I'm in Tampa Improv.  Tomorrow's Friday, Saturday.  Be there or be square.  That's hip.  Are you burnt out from flying?  I threw the red eye and I'm exhausted.  I mean, in general, are you tired of traveling and making piles of cash?  I make good money, but it's not piles of cash.  But I mean, yeah, I was in Atlanta and then...  How's merch selling these days with the...  Some are good.  The stuff they have is not, you know.  What sells best of your merch? 
[03:45:30]  Would it be T-shirts or DVDs?  The new T-shirts are selling pretty well.  Are they all black?  No, these are white.  They're white?  Two Uncle Paul shirts and one Chip shirt.  I had this conversation.  People don't buy T-shirts unless they're black.  They're buying the white ones, though.  The people?  People.  They don't want fucking any color but black.  It's weird.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  And all of our fans are fat.  They think it's slimming.  Yes, it is very slimming for our fans.  But is your merchandise good, even in the economy's shit now?  No, it doesn't do as well in the bad economy shit. 
[03:46:00]  I can throw out all the mediums I bought.  I can toss them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's one.  Done.  Now, the double X.  No, a medium doesn't fit anybody.  A child, it fits.  Well, the girls.  Girls.  Hot chicks.  Oh, yeah.  But no hot chicks.  Yeah, okay.  Put a medium on them.  They'll look cute.  Yeah, get in there.  Make you cry.  Yeah.  Get in there and put some design X on there.  Design X.  Covers up the sauce pots.  Bobby, Bobby, where the fuck are you going to be?  August 19th through the 20th, Off the Hook Comedy Club, Marco Island in Florida.
