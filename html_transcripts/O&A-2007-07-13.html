<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a recap of their recent Philadelphia trip, detailing a busy schedule including Jimmy Norton's book signings, a listener party at a lake (with amusing anecdotes about observing elderly people), and their extended wakefulness.  They highlighted positive interactions with staff (Karen Buck and David at YSP) and listeners.  A bizarre incident involving a guest, "Duffy," who revealed a body part resembling a manipulated brain, was recounted, along with the subsequent icing-a-cake and cupcake antics, culminating in Louis Twitchell Santani eating the cupcake icing for money. Photos were said to be available on their website.

The show then covered the Don Imus controversy, expressing their opinions on freedom of speech and criticizing Al Sharpton's response, using highly offensive language to describe the Rutgers women's basketball team.  Upcoming tour dates were announced, including discounted tickets and a free admission offer for military personnel in Massachusetts.  Scheduled guest appearances by D.L. Hughley and a phone call with Michael Moore were mentioned.  A listener called in to describe having his XM radio repeatedly stolen, leading to a discussion about car break-ins. Opie shared a personal anecdote about being robbed at gunpoint at a McDonald's. The "Guess the Sound" segment featured two sounds, one speculated to be spanking or tasering.  They also joked about Jill Nicolini's absence from her morning show, promoted Jimmy Norton's book signings further, and included a humorous segment about producer Sam's unusual dinner choices.  The entire broadcast was filled with frequent offensive language, crude humor, and discussions of potentially sensitive topics.

The next segment began with a discussion of the show's message boards and a shift in conversation from show-related topics to more personal ones. The hosts then discussed the return of CBS FM in New York, comparing its oldies format to the previous Jack format, criticizing the latter's lack of personality and repetitive playlists, and commenting on the minimal on-air personality coverage in the local news.  A "Guess the Sound" segment followed, with increasingly explicit descriptions of sounds, one involving genital electrocution and the other a woman's sounds interpreted as either laughter or pain during an apple-related activity (later revealed as sexual).

The show promoted their "Virus Tour," with a confused but comedic explanation of discounted ticket offers, including a special offer for Philadelphia and a military giveaway in Boston.  This was followed by a conversation with D.L. Hughley, discussing his career, censorship, boycotts, and views on freedom of speech, particularly regarding racial issues and corporate sponsorships.  Hughley shared anecdotes about dealing with controversy and refusing to apologize for his jokes. The conversation explored the complexities of racial sensitivities in comedy and the pressures faced by comedians.

This discussion continued in the next segment,  with Hughley arguing that comedians should face no limitations on their material. He used the example of the symbolic burial of the N-word in Detroit, contrasting it with the city’s actual violence. He emphasized his aim was to make people laugh at societal flaws, citing hypocrisy among prominent figures.  The conversation then shifted to the challenges faced by comedians in an increasingly sensitive climate, with Hughley expressing frustration with censorship.  The hosts and Hughley discussed the influence of corporate lawyers and executives on creative content and the relationship between difficult times and great comedy.

A significant portion of this segment played audio clips of Michael Moore criticizing CNN and mainstream media bias, particularly regarding the Iraq War and healthcare.  The hosts and Hughley shared their opinions, discussing inherent biases, conflicts of interest, and corporate influence in news reporting, particularly concerning pharmaceutical and insurance companies' influence on healthcare. Hughley advocated for addressing these issues rather than fully embracing socialized medicine.  The segment concluded with further discussion of the comedy tour, including details on ticket promotions and a military event in Mansfield, a humorous story about Hughley's departure due to a scheduling conflict with Hot 97, and mentions of other comedians Demetrius Nicodemus and P.J. Buttland present in the studio.  Anthony’s large casino win was also mentioned.

A subsequent excerpt included discussions on the hosts' political leanings, Jim Norton's book "Happy Endings," and a listener's criticism of Norton. Norton recounted a story about receiving oral sex from a gay man, leading to a discussion about sexuality.  The conversation covered Norton's book signings, including an anecdote about signing a man's buttocks, along with their musical preferences and opinions on Gene Simmons and Ozzy Osbourne.  There was a significant update on Big A's health following tumor surgery, and an unexpected in-studio appearance by Pat Duffy and his girlfriend, resulting in explicit discussions about their relationship.

Another excerpt started with a humorous anecdote about oral sex in a car, followed by a discussion of stick figure love notes before a planned interview with Michael Moore. Moore discussed his film "Sicko," the American healthcare system, HMOs, and his experience anonymously paying for the medical bills of an anti-Moore website operator.  The conversation explored various political and social viewpoints, including discussions of socialized medicine and media criticisms. The hosts shared their opinions on Moore's filmmaking and political stance.  The interview concluded with listener calls and emails, including a humorous exchange about "Super Size Me," and further banter, including a discussion of "We Built This City on Rock and Roll" and a final line of the day segment.

The final excerpt began with a discussion of gifts received, including wine instead of an iPhone and a chocolate gift in a toilet.  This transitioned into a discussion of a K-Rock radio contest for Smashing Pumpkins tickets, followed by a story about Billy Corrigan's accidental profanity on satellite radio. The main focus shifted to a prank call segment where the hosts, using various personas, called the K-Rock contest line, using sexually suggestive and crude questions about callers' penis size. The hosts used numerous profane and vulgar comments and questions, harassing callers with repeated vulgar inquiries about their penis size. The segment abruptly ended with mentions of upcoming segments and a Howard Stern anecdote about a "wow" sticker.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their audience.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Paris, your strip search was the search of something we like to call the old two-hander.  Did they do the old grip and rip?  This is where the favorite is going.  What is that?  Extreme camel toe.  Ew.  Oh, God damn. 
[00:01:00]  Ew.  Oh, God, you got a complete camel toe.  Opie and Anthony.  If you are here, give us a sign.  Oh, boy.  My wallet is gone.  Oh, my God.  It's with us beyond the grave.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the roll.  Where are we?  What city are we in? 
[00:01:30]  Where are we?  We're at our flagship station.  We are?  Let me look out for the car.  We're at the flagship.  Oh, yeah.  The buildings are a little taller.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Good morning.  This is the Opie and Anthony show back in New York City.  What a time in Philly.  Man.  I got to tell you, I was leaving the hotel yesterday.  Yeah.  In Philly.  I got a little sad.  Did you?  I actually did.  I got sad.  Aw.  They treated us like rock stars down there.  The show sounded great. 
[00:02:00]  The staff down there, real motivated about the radio show.  Of course, talking about the staff at YSP, Karen Buck and the gang.  David.  Very cool.  And we took off, and I got a little sad.  It really went very, very well down there.  I was just too delirious for anything but driving.  I had to go.  We had a schedule down there.  That was a hell of a schedule.  Not like, you know, not talking like manual labor, work type, getting tired that way. 
[00:02:30]  I'm just talking the sheer number of hours we were up and awake and doing things.  A lot of stuff.  And then Jimmy's book signings were just a rip.  Had a great time for listeners.  It started Tuesday night with a book signing in New York City, then jump into our cars,  go down to Philly, sleep about four or five hours, do the radio show, and then go party  with the listeners at a bar on a lake.  Next to old people, by the way. 
[00:03:00]  We haven't even talked about that.  Oh, God.  That was funny.  I forgot about that.  We show up at the Lagoon in Essington down there in Philly.  And really cool joint.  You got Octane, a really good band playing, wet t-shirt contest.  It was a nice rocket party.  Yeah.  Too bad it was 1130 in the morning on a Wednesday.  No problem.  Yeah.  Actually, it wasn't a problem for our listeners.  And then you just kind of look off to the right, and there's old people in lounge chairs reading  like books and stuff.  Yeah.  Apparently, they all collect by that lake over there and just kind of sit in their little 
[00:03:30]  chairs that they bring with them and umbrellas and then read.  Yeah.  And I just saw some old couples sitting next to each other just looking, and you know  the guy is just miserable.  Why the hell are you dragging me down here every day?  Just trying to do something.  Oh, Iraq got pictures of the old people.  Oh, there's the old codgers.  Okay.  So that's up on our website that we still can't mention because that would be hurtful for the  radio show.  Hurtful. 
[00:04:00]  But just trying to figure out our website.  It has something to do with the name of the radio show.  Do's Google.  Well, yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, they are.  There's pictures of old people reading with umbrellas and beach chairs.  Yeah, old people.  And then there were some young children playing a little further down and some creepy guy  in a suit looking at them.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  That's never good.  Never good.  That never turns out good.  But apparently, that's what they do.  The old people just hang out there. 
[00:04:30]  It's like a little place for them to read and reflect and die.  And then after that, we went and did Jim Norton's book signing at the Barnes & Noble.  That was a huge success.  Man.  Then we went out to dinner, another four hours of sleep, five hours of sleep, and then the  radio show.  And then finally, boom, hit the road back to New York to go to bed for about 16 hours.  That was a tough drive.  Anthony had a little contest in the office, and I guess you won.  Oh, yeah.  That's why you wanted the contest.  You knew you would win.  Of course, I knew I was in. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  I was like, come on, who slept more?  Who slept the longest after that whirlwind trip to Philly and back?  I had a slight, like, I woke up for two hours at 9 p.m., so I was up from 9 to 11.  But in between that, without counting that, I was asleep from 2.30 in the afternoon until  4.30 when I woke up.  It was just, but it was great.  I got in the door at 2.28. 
[00:05:30]  I was asleep by 2.30.  I just, a trail of clothes, into bed, boom, and then for, like, maybe a minute, I woke  up at 4.30 in the afternoon, which just freaks me out.  I look.  I go, oh, my God, no.  It can't be time to get up already.  It cannot be time to get up.  And I look out the window, I notice it's a little too light for it to be 4.30 in the 
[00:06:00]  morning, because I thought I had to get up and come here.  Yeah.  But then you're looking around, you're all confused, and then I just fell back to sleep.  Didn't get a call from Than, so I was safe.  Didn't matter.  Than's your third alarm clock.  He's my fail-safe.  Yeah.  If it hits 5.15, then he calls me, and if I'm still at home, that's my fail-safe point  where I could still make it in by 6 with, you know, brushing my teeth, getting dressed,  out the door, and a million miles an hour into work. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Fail-safe.  Well, there you go.  But, yeah, I just slept.  It was after that kind of a couple of days.  But it was great, because we got done with the show on, what, Tuesday, and then we left?  Then we have all those shenanigans in Philly.  And, hey, look, it's Friday.  It is Friday.  It's Friday.  It's Air Guitar Friday.  No, don't Air Guitar.  I'm going to, I'm pointing and laughing at you for Air Guitarring.  It is Point and Laugh Friday.  It's FU Friday.  It's Mispronunciation Friday. 
[00:07:00]  We might have to dump that one.  Why?  Why?  I don't know.  Isn't it popular?  And then Jimmy.  I think you've already got it with World Wind.  You know, since we've seen Jimmy, he did another book signing.  Oh, I know.  People were asking if I was going.  You're going to Jimmy's book signing?  I'm like, I love Jimmy.  I'm going to drop dead if I don't go to sleep.  I don't know how you did it.  I did phoners from 11 a.m. yesterday, probably until 5 p.m. 
[00:07:30]  A lot of our affiliates, they talk to Shred and Reagan in Buffalo.  They're great, huh?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A lot of the states, Grand Rapids, Michigan, all of our states.  You got the wolf.  I screwed up that one.  Missed Q on time.  Oh, you missed the wolf.  Yeah.  You blew them off, huh?  No, I called them 15 minutes early and they didn't call me back until I was already asleep.  Yeah.  So, yeah, the books were sold out in Jersey, so try to get to these things early because  there was like 70 people who had to just order and not get books, so I signed CDs for them 
[00:08:00]  instead.  Really?  Cool, Jimmy.  Congratulations.  Sold out?  Yeah.  Sold out.  That's, you know.  It was sold out.  The funny, on Amazon, they took the reviews down.  Why would they take those wonderful reviews down?  For happy ending.  I don't know.  They took the reviews down.  I think somebody probably complained and they read all the Robert Reed jokes and broth and  robe.  What is it?  So, do you need the pest to do real reviews now?  Nah, whatever they want to do is fine.  All right, all right.  You know who's a real dick behind the scenes? 
[00:08:30]  Who?  Kid Chris.  What?  I'm just trying to get the message boards going.  He was unbelievable.  That guy was a blast, man.  What a pisser we had with him doing his show and then him coming on our show and then the  satellite portion of the show.  Wow.  That got way out of hand.  How do we, do we have pictures of what happened on the satellite show yesterday?  They're going up.  They're going up?  Okay.  I hope Kid Chris told everybody down there in Philly because we finally had to get off 
[00:09:00]  the air.  Oh, man.  And continue on XM.  And Kid Chris stayed with us.  Yeah.  And I know a lot of the people listening right now know what happened, but there's a whole  bunch that didn't.  Yeah.  Or don't know what happened.  Uh, basically the guy with the huge, huge, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.  He was able to take a part of his body.  Thank you, Anthony.  Um, and squeeze it with his thumb and forefinger and make it inflate like, um, like two balloons. 
[00:09:30]  Like, um, two balloons put next to each other very closely.  Like a brain it looked.  It looked like a brain actual size.  Yeah.  It was just giant.  I don't know what freakish problem this guy said.  He said there was a buildup of fluid in this part of his body.  Um, and he was able to, uh, like squeeze it and the, um, the, uh, container that the actual 
[00:10:00]  parts are in, uh, expand to look like a brain.  Wow.  You're brilliant.  Giant.  You're brilliant.  And he was holding this.  It was as big as a, uh, a nice size fist.  Yeah.  A fist.  Easily.  And he's holding it.  Everything else was, uh, neatly contained where, where it belongs except for that.  He brought that out, uh, and, and just kind of held it.  Oh, look at the picture.  Look at that picture. 
[00:10:30]  It is absolutely a brain.  You know what it looks like?  It looks like the top of the hiney headed aliens from the menagerie episode of Star Trek.  They talk through telepathy.  Oh, I didn't, I didn't see, I didn't see this when I was down there in Philly.  Oh God.  It's disturbing.  I saw what you're looking at or what we're all looking at now from a, from a distance.  And now this, this is a closeup.  That's amazing.  It does nothing short of amazing.  Oh my God.  Oh yeah.  It looks like the head in Mars attacks. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Doesn't it just put a helmet on it?  You know what it looks like?  You ever get one of those dumb, like stress things?  Yeah.  The stress relieving.  Uh, and you squeeze it in the head that gets really wide and the ears pop out and the  eyes pop out.  That's what it looks like.  Something like that.  And, uh, he, he took them when he had them in this, uh, position and condition all expanded.  And, um, Jimmy had a wonderful cake.  Somebody made Jimmy a wonderful cake. 
[00:11:30]  That was, uh, actually the cover of his book was at the top of the cake.  Octane did that.  The band.  Octane.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was beautiful.  And it looks exactly like the book.  Yeah.  You probably have seen this by now.  They have this new technology with the blah, blah.  Yeah.  You could eat it.  Yeah.  Well, you wouldn't want to after this stunt.  Well, no.  But, uh, he took what he was gripping in his hands and wiped it on the icing on the cake.  Really dug it in.  Well, but that didn't, uh, do the job.  So then, uh, uh, then he decided to, uh, ice a cupcake. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  He iced a cupcake.  Put icing on a cupcake.  He grabbed what he had in his hand, uh, squeezed and expanded.  Oh, we got pictures of that.  Oh, I see.  So it looked like a cupcake.  And then he took a knife and put it in the icing and iced it.  All this was because Louis Twitchell Santani was in studio and he was offered, um, a sum  of money to remove that icing. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  With his tongue.  Yeah.  And, uh, he did.  Yeah.  Well, he, he got down to the point where he was ready to do it.  Um, well, I was trying to figure out how this guy Duffy, he's the, he's the new star of  the Opie and Anthony show.  This guy Duffy, how he was going to get out of this because he's got a, he's got an answer  to his friends after this, uh, this radio stuff.  Yeah.  Like, dude, we, we were listening to Opie and Anthony this morning.  You let a guy do that to you?  Yeah.  You know what?  Yeah.  I think he walks away and, and, uh, still, still cool to his friends. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Cause at the last second he was like, I ain't letting him like nothing.  He, he decided to, to just like press it into, into Twitchell's face really hard.  He pushed the icing into Twitchell's face and Twitchell's just gets up going, ah, and he  had it all around his mouth.  He had it everywhere.  He was just a mess, but, uh, there, there's a picture of Twitchell's now, uh, up on the 
[00:13:30]  site with icing all over his face, which just shows where this part of, uh, his body  landed.  Yup.  It was his, his, uh, upper lip, his, both of his lips, his whole mouth and his chin.  He had him on the chin.  Up under the nose.  Yeah.  So that's what happened after we got off the air at, uh, at, uh, YSP yesterday.  Yeah.  So the pictures are up on the website and, uh, just amazing.  By the way, that was on XM. 
[00:14:00]  I don't want anybody to think that we get off the air and just did that for our own leisure.  Well, cause then, then we would have problems.  Could have done that.  All right.  Hey, uh, next stop, Boston, everybody.  Yes.  Next stop is Boston.  A week from tomorrow, believe it or not, is the next one traveling virus comedy show  brought to you by Bud Light.  It always worth it and go to virus tour.  One word on my space for all the info on the comedy tour.  But so far, the reviews have been great for this tour.  We're, uh, believe it or not, we're halfway over.  Well, no, not really. 
[00:14:30]  After Boston, we'll be halfway over.  Um, we're doing something very, very special for Boston.  Uh, you guys have to know by now that we completely support the troops, completely support the military.  And, uh, I guess there's going to be like 10,000 troops in the Massachusetts area undergoing training.  And some of the bases reach out to us to find out about doing a discount for the troops to come down and see the show.  Well, we've decided to take this a step further, everybody.  Hmm.  Uh, in an effort to support our troops, we are offering free admission to the traveling virus show in Mansfield, Massachusetts, 
[00:15:00]  a week from Saturday for anyone who presents a valid military ID.  How cool is that?  Nice.  Tickets will be available at the show.  One ticket per military ID and the seats will be, uh, pavilion seats, not lawn.  So they're good seats as well.  You're not just throwing the military, uh, you know, on the lawn.  They're going to have a nice seats in the pavilion for free.  And we're going to take a couple of phoners from some soldiers later on this morning.  Okay.  So that's what part of their training, put them in the middle of a bunch of people. 
[00:15:30]  They probably aren't going to like or get along with our listeners.  It's going to be a nice mixture of the Mansfield show, but that's really cool.  Once again, if you've got a military ID, you get in free, uh, a week from, uh, tomorrow in Mansfield, Massachusetts for the comedy show.  Okay.  Yes.  Uh, and then this is really cool.  And Boston is out of this one.  Boston is not doing the $10 promotion.  We are announcing a $10 promotion today for Detroit, DC, the PNC in Jersey. 
[00:16:00]  And of course the Philly show.  When we go back there to the tweeter center in Camden, New Jersey, $10 lawn tickets go on sale.  Uh, this coming Tuesday at 9am through Ticketmaster, $10 lawn seats.  I read on a message boards and whatnot that, uh, people were waiting for this, right?  They fully expected it and we're, we're waiting this gag.  Well, it's finally here and, uh, we're only going to do it, uh, uh, Tuesday.  That is it at midnight.

That's only Philly.  Only Philly.  Wow.  For the tweeter center.  For the tweeter center.  You could be from anywhere.  If you're going to the tweeter center, we don't want to say you have to show Philly ID center in Camden.  Well, that's a big thank you for Philly because they were just unbelievable to us.  I mean, we're giving a thank you to every city, obviously, but we want to, we, we want to do something a little special for Philly because, uh, they just rocked the last few days. 
[00:17:30]  So Philly, uh, the $10 lawn tickets will be on sale from Tuesday at 9am running through Friday at 5pm.  A little, a little, a little, uh, confusing here.  I, I, I understand.  So if, uh, if you're online, go to virus tour, one word for, for the update on the tour.  Okay.  But basically $10 lawn tickets go on sale Tuesday for Detroit, DC, the PNC in Jersey, and the tweeter center in Camden, New Jersey.  Very good.  All right.  There you go.  Uh, just getting warmed up here.  We got DL Hughley coming in today. 
[00:18:00]  Yes.  We got Michael Moore calling the show today.  Michael Moore's calling.  Yep.  You saw his movie sicko, right?  Yep.  All right.  We'll talk about that next.  How's that?  Yeah.  And Michael Moore lost his, uh, lost his, you know, what on, uh, CNN the other night.  We got the audio.  It's pretty good.  Lost his, uh, mind, his, uh, patience, his, uh, you're going to have to stick around to find out.  Excellent.  No, no, no.  Still, he still has that.  And of course, if you have something for the show, 877-212-5762, it's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:18:30]  Now, how about the Imus debacle?  I want to get your take on this.  Well, how do you always have it?  You know what?  I'll tell you what.  Freedom of speech is kind of a zero-sum, uh, you know, proposition.  Either you believe in it or you don't.  Now, whether you agree with what Imus says or not, I found it funny, he had the right to say it.  You know what?  It has never been about what somebody called you.  It's what you answer to that's the deal.  I mean, I wouldn't take down Imus.  He looked like a werewolf that didn't finish changing.  Don't he?  He looked like he was just about to be a werewolf, but then the sun came out. 
[00:19:00]  And Al Sharpton was on TV more than the women of Rutgers.  He did.  At one point, I thought he played for Rutgers.  I'm like, who's the chubby chick with the perl?  The chubby chick with the perl.  All this marching he's doing, he can't lose no weight?  Are you kidding me?  And then, let's face it, you know, he called them hoes, uh, nappy-headed hoes, and they weren't hoes. 
[00:19:30]  But it was some nappy-headed women on that team.  Shut up, I'm gonna say it.  I don't give a damn if y'all like it or not.  You know, it's true.  Them is some of the ugliest women I've ever seen in my whole life.  Are you kidding me?  Thank you.  Good night, everybody.  We're off to you.  Thank you.  Let me tell you something.  If you can palm a basketball and braid your own hair, somebody's gonna say something about you.  You know what I mean?  Oh, the first time they had makeup on was the press conference.  You kidding me?  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:20:00]  The double standard is alive and well.  That's great.  That's D.L. Hughley.  He's coming in in about an hour and a half.  How great is that he did that on Leno?  Amazing.  Yeah.  And Leno wasn't a baby about it.  No.  You know what I mean?  And that was when he could have gotten in trouble for it.  Right at the heat of that controversy.  Jumped on there.  Said it like it was.  We got another clip.  You want to hear it?  Sure.  And this is what I'm saying.  This is my whole point.  Yeah.  I don't believe that you have to look at something and if it's politically incorrect, you decide that that's not funny. 
[00:20:30]  You can understand.  You can laugh at anything you want to.  And now they want to say it now, Jesse and Al and everybody, you don't like white people are wondering, how come I can't say the N word or the B word or the H word?  You can.  You can say whatever.  I wouldn't do it in Englewood.  Right.  They're like, how come rappers get to do it?  You know, the only cool thing about being black is you get to say stuff other people can't say.  But if you want, we can trade.  We'll rule the world and you guys. 
[00:21:00]  And we'll throw in sickle cell and police brutality just because we got one.  He just killed on Leno.  Absolutely killed.  There's one more.  It's a quickie.  And then we'll move on with the show.  Now, should Don Imus have gone on Al something?  No, man.  He shouldn't apologize.  He said what he said.  And that was it.  You know, I'm glad that our black leaders have their priorities together because, you know, it's amazing because one in three, every 93 percent of black people in this country are killed by other black people. 
[00:21:30]  One in three black people in this country can't read.  And more black men are in prison than in college.  But we went after Don Imus.  We finally got the one white guy that was responsible for holding us back.  Thank God stuff will get better now.  That's all I'm saying.  There you go.  Where's Al when it comes to that stuff?  Where's Al?  Great point, man.  Yeah, we'll talk more with D.L. Hughley about some of this stuff later on this morning.  Is he playing Caroline's?  Is that why he's coming in today?  I do not.  Does anybody have his info?  I think so. 
[00:22:00]  I do believe that's the reason.  He'll sell out wherever he's playing.  Well, we met him in Washington because he was doing his HBO special the same time Jimmy was.  And he was staying at the hotel.  And we had a great, great little chat there.  And he can't wait to come on our show.  So we're excited.  I did Tough Crowd with him twice.  That was when I met D.L. back in 2003.  And I didn't think we were going to get along at first because I figured out politically we're completely the opposite.  Yeah.  It's great, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He speaks his mind.  Yes.  And he's allowed to because he's black.  He's allowed.  Double Standard is alive and well. 
[00:22:30]  We'll talk about that with him.  But he would never ask you not to speak your mind.  No.  Oh, I'm not playing out.  Yeah, absolutely.  It's white guys in suits that ask you not to speak your mind because they're the Gilbert ones.  He's not.  He's great.  As cool as Leno is, I think if a white comic went on right around the time I just got kicked off the air and tried to do exactly what D.L. Hughley, you know, what you just heard.  No way.  Yes.  It's not flying.  They're going to be like, ah, no.  Yeah.  That's one of the problems that we're having, this Double Standard thing. 
[00:23:00]  It's very difficult to work with when you're doing radio.  It's all over the news since, you know, we're back in New York here and they got the, you know, kind of the cop killer.  Got to call him the cop killer because he pretty much killed this guy's life.  Well.  I mean, the guy's still holding on, but he's paralyzed.  He took what?  It's real bad.  Yeah.  Of 45 right to the head.  Two.  Two shots to the head.  Two shots to the face.  Two.  And they found these animals in the Poconos.  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  Just kind of hanging out in the woods.  Could you find a place where black people would blend in less than beautiful Mount Airy Lodge?  Mount Airy Lodge.  They were all found in one of those big champagne glasses in a hotel room.  They set the dogs after them.  Yeah.  The bloodhounds.  And that was it.  They found them.  They found them in some bushes.  Well, they found Dexter on the side of the highway.  Is that true?  Yeah.  He was just kind of walking on the side of the highway.  And then they found the other guy kind of in the woods sitting up against a tree with 
[00:24:00]  a hood kind of covering his face.  And he was begging for mercy as the cops, you know, approached him.  Yeah.  And he's screaming, I don't have a gun.  I don't have a gun.  Please.  He was begging.  I should have just.  There's no cameras in the woods.  That's it.  There's no video cameras in the woods.  You could say there was a little resist thing.  You take out the clubs.  You tune them up a bit.  And then you take them in.  Yeah.  I mean, they had to do some symbolic things like the cuffs they used to cuff them were 
[00:24:30]  one of the cops' cuffs that they were using.  One of the guy that's clinging to life, Timothy there.  I'd love to say his last name, but I keep forgetting.  I mean, Russell, why did I say Timothy?  I'm sorry.  Russell.  His last name is Timoshenko.  Yeah.  That's why I got a little confused.  Yeah.  Russell Timoshenko.  His cuffs they used to cuff these guys when they found them in the Poconos.  Yeah.  Too bad they couldn't use his gun.  There you go.  Too bad they couldn't use his gun.  There you go.  Get those shots off that maybe he missed getting off. 
[00:25:00]  Street justice.  Right.  Too bad.  But they got them.  And now they're looking into whether these guys were using these stolen cars that they  were.  Because the one guy had a job at a car dealership.  They had a job at a car dealership and they were stealing cars from there and using them  for various criminal activities, prostitution, robberies.  Picking hookers or making girls hookers?  Making girls.  Yeah.  So kind of recruiting.  What does that all matter? 
[00:25:30]  The one guy's definitely going to jail for life.  He's not going to get the death penalty.  We talked about that earlier this week.  We don't use the death penalty.  New debate, of course, because of these events that if you kill a cop, you should get the  death penalty in New York.  That's mandatory, I think, in New Jersey, especially in uniform, because their target's  in uniform.  Yep.  Exactly.  They're a target.  It ain't going to happen.  No, of course it won't.  It's not going to happen.  Especially if it's a black guy shooting a white guy.  Somebody will tap into the guilt of that and go, well, you know, they had the history  with the police.  You know, some nonsense. 
[00:26:00]  Enough.  So we got the two guys, but we're all like, all right.  You know?  Yeah.  What do you think?  Now it's just going to be like years and years of court battling.  I know the NYPD, there was a lot of rejoicing and a lot of applauding at the hospital because  they're just hanging out at the hospital.  Yeah.  But I don't know.  I just got to wish the guy the best.  Maybe a miracle will happen.  I just wish there was some kind of, you know, some kind of fleeing that occurred and, you 
[00:26:30]  know, the trooper had to do what he had to do.  Had to do something, you know.  But there you have it.  Let's go to Steve in Boston.  Steve, what's going on today?  Hey, I just got to give a big FQ to the guy that keeps on breaking into my tie.  I'm taking my XM.  Third time.  He breaks into what?  Your condo?  Car.  No, my car.  What do you have to pick it?  My car.  My automobile.  But I get on.  I live up on the North Shore.  I go all the way down to Framingham. 
[00:27:00]  You guys know where that is.  Yeah, of course.  55 miles each way.  And then Jerkoff keeps on taking my XM.  And that's all I get to do is listen to you guys in the car.  Well, why don't you get the hint and maybe get a unit that you can take with you or put  in your glove compartment?  Because I had an XM unit stolen.  And I got another one.  And I made sure it wasn't in clear view there.  No, I'm an idiot.  I'm an idiot.  Okay.  All right.  Well, at least you're the good guy.  As long as we got that straight. 
[00:27:30]  Man, you get your car broken into once.  You're hiding everything after that.  I don't even leave change in my car anymore.  Because I know that's all it will take for someone to break your window.  So for lousy change, they'll break a side window.  Yeah.  No, I just, I want to say, like, if this kid's listening, I will gladly go shopping with  him.  And if he knocks on my door next time, and, you know, maybe we can figure something out  in the backyard. 
[00:28:00]  And if he wins, we'll go shopping.  Right.  All right, man.  Well, good luck to you.  I'm sorry.  Well, that sounds like an invitation any criminal would take up.  All right, I'll go to your house.  Yeah, all right.  Knock on your door.  We'll do a little shopping at Best Buy.  Truth of the matter is, you always feel violated when you get ripped off, and you just never  get any retribution for it.  You've just been violated, and that's it.  It's such a weird feeling, isn't it?  Yeah.  It's a weird feeling to know that someone was among your stuff.  When you go back to your car and just see the glass on the ground, and it doesn't hit 
[00:28:30]  you yet, and you go like, what the, why is there, my window's broke?  Did someone throw something through?  And you look in, and like, your crap's just gone.  You just see wires.  Yeah, wires are pulled out, and you're like, no.  And then you think maybe you could solve it quickly just by looking around.  You stand up on your tippy toes and look around the lot.  Oh, there it is.  Like the perp is still running down the sidewalk.  There it is.  I could just rewire this back in and get the window fixed and be on my way.  He's long gone.  No.  Your stuff is already resold.  You're driving home with a butt cheek full of window. 
[00:29:00]  Right.  And you're hoping your whole car doesn't start on fire from a short circuit with just the  sound of the wind blowing over your side view mirrors because you don't have a radio  anymore.  Oh, that just sucks.  Cursing under your breath.  When I moved to Buffalo to do radio, my car got broken into, and this is how stupid I was  back in the day.  I'm still pretty stupid, but I had all my possessions up to that point in my life in a little Honda 
[00:29:30]  cord, and I was too lazy to empty out my car into my new apartment.  Of course.  And I thought I was living in a pretty good area.  Learned later on that, wow, this was not a good area.  And I go to work.  I was doing overnights, and I go to work, and I walk through the parking lot.  I was parking the Honda in the parking lot, and there I see everything I owned up to that  point all over the driveway, or the parking lot, I should say, the parking lot.  That's just... 
[00:30:00]  With not one, but two windows broken.  They went through everything.  Yeah.  And they didn't really get much, because I didn't really have much at that point.  Just stuff that was important to me, but wouldn't be important to anyone else.  Right.  Awards were just thrown on the parking lot, and pictures, family pictures.  They got to rifle through stuff pretty quickly.  Yeah.  My CD collection that I cherish, just thrown all over the place.  And they got a couple watches, and I don't even remember anymore. 
[00:30:30]  Just a couple watches, and maybe a necklace or something.  That was it.  You hear about this guy in Massapequa here on Long Island, out on Long Island.  A guy in Massapequa wakes up to a couple of guys punching him in the face.  How's that for a, pssh, pssh, wake up, wake up, come on.  Just guys punching you in the face, and a flashlight in your face.  Yeah.  Another home invasion, and apparently they came in through, and this always gets me, 
[00:31:00]  they came in through an open window on the first floor because it was warm.  It was warm out, so they opened the windows.  And people that do home invasions just love this.  They love the cheapos that won't shut the windows and put on the air conditioning  or open up an upstairs window, which is bad, too.  You know, they could access that.  My window's locked.  No kidding.  Locked year round.  You even have to say that? 
[00:31:30]  I have the air conditioning on.  That's what it's there for.  We live in a wonderful modern age where you can turn on your air conditioning  and lock those windows.  The alarm, beep, beep, it's on.  Set all the time.  All the time.  I've set it off when the Chinese guy comes to the, the Chinese food guy comes to the door.  I get out of bed maybe early on a Saturday or something like that.  Saturday afternoon.  I sleep till noon.  I was going to say early for Anthony on a Saturday. 
[00:32:00]  It's like three in the afternoon.  No, I want some lunch.  From bed, I'll phone the Chinese food place.  I order some Chinese food, and then I hear the doorbell.  I run downstairs.  I'm still a little groggy.  I just fling the door open.  Woo, woo, woo, woo.  Oh, boy.  He thinks he won something.  Like he's the millionth deliverer.  He gets all happy.  Probably could be.  They're scared, though.  The delivery guys are scared.  Even in my neighborhood, which is a pretty nice neighborhood, 
[00:32:30]  you could tell that they're scared because a lot of people will call delivery guy  and then rob him or kill him, something like that.  So every time I'm walking down the stairs, I look,  and I could see the poor little guys like peeking in my window  that's kind of on the side of my doors, kind of looking in going,  oh, is this going to be safe?  You're insane.  Why?  In your neighborhood, hell no.  But they're scared.  Hell no.  Exactly.  They're taking that time to look in your window to see what they can come back for 
[00:33:00]  when you're on the road.  You haven't heard what the criminals do these days?  They rent mansions for a weekend?  No, they find ones that are not sold yet.  They break into them, call up, give the address.  It's a vacant house in a nice neighborhood to lull the guy into a false sense of security.  And then the door opens up, and in that second,  the delivery guy knows there's a problem.  And, yeah, he gets the crap beat out of him if he's lucky. 
[00:33:30]  It's a million-dollar house, and your hat is sideways.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, oh, there's a problem.  Hey, Brad in Atlanta, what's up?  Good morning, boys.  How you doing, Jimmy?  Hello.  I pretty much was just calling in and giving F you to my ex-girlfriend.  She pretty much left me because I had no money and no prospects,  and my grandfather just died sadly and has left me with a half a million dollars.  So, hey, F you, Kaisley.  Good boy.  Wow.  Wait.  I spent a bit on poker with you. 
[00:34:00]  So you were in love with this girl.  It didn't work out.  She left you?  Oh, yes, sir.  I was devastated.  Oh, you were devastated.  Okay.  And then how much longer that your grandfather died there?  It was about roughly, I mean, like on and off.  We kind of broke up officially for about a year, you know,  but we're still effing each other and whatnot.  Yeah.  And, you know, probably about three months.  So, hey.  Congratulations to you.  But you're a sucker.  You're going to go back to her anyway.  You're going to try one more.  Huh?  No, sir. 
[00:34:30]  Not a chance in hell.  No?  I'm going to spend my money on playing poker with Anthony Cumia.  Oh.  Hey, there you go.  Wow.  All right, Brad.  Congratulations to you.  Good luck to you.  Let's go to Matt in Boston.  Before you go to Matt, can I tell you a moment?  We know you're in trouble.  Yeah, yeah.  With a robbery.  My girlfriend and I, years ago, were eating at McDonald's in Jersey.  And it was August.  And it's late.  And this girl, Tina, I was dating.  And we're sitting there.  And I see three guys running in wearing ski masks and big heavy coats.  And I'm like, uh-oh. 
[00:35:00]  You immediately know you're – because I'm like a detective.  And in August, when I see three black gentlemen running in with big parkas and ski masks,  I think they've either just gotten off a plane from a fun ski trip.  I didn't have time to change.  Or we're an hour from the airport, and there's nowhere around here to ski.  So they're probably going to rob us.  And instinctively, I understood this was a robbery.  Yeah. 
[00:35:30]  And it was scary.  They came in.  You saw a robbery going on?  I had a gun pointed at me.  I was involved in one.  The guy walked in with a –  There's three guys.  At McDonald's.  We were sitting there facing the window.  So the guy was running to our left.  You know, everybody to the mother-effing in front of the store.  And there was – I'll never forget this black woman who was in there.  Excuse me, sir.  I'm eating my Big Mac.  I said that to him.  I'm like, are you going to provide a refund for these cold fries?  And there was a black woman.  I'll never forget her going, oh, oh. 
[00:36:00]  She just didn't handle it well.  No, she didn't.  And she ran out of the store.  Wow.  Ran out of the store.  One guy runs up to the front with a pistol.  He's waving it.  The one guy runs to the one side of the store.  There's two exits.  He blocks the exit.  The one guy with the pistol takes the employee to the back and is screaming, open the safe.  Open the – I mean, I'm like, this guy's going to get shot.  And the other guy kind of does crowd control.  So he gets me and my girlfriend up.  What do you mean by crowd control?  Making sure that we all –  Yeah.  Everybody listens. 
[00:36:30]  I thought he might be doing a little comedy or something.  Yeah, you get five minutes.  Where are you from?  He does impressions, but only the voices.  I'm a burn victim because he has a ski mask.  I'm like, you're a criminal.  Yes.  So he calls –  They singled you guys out?  No, no, no.  They made everybody get to the front.  But he walked – we were by the doors.  We walked in.  He goes, come on, come on, get up.  So he kind of grabs my girlfriend by the arm just to get her up out of the seat.  She trips and falls.  I'm like, he's going to take her and rape her.  Like, I mean, not realizing that in a robbery they're not going to rape you at a McDonald's,  which is probably healthier than actually eating there. 
[00:37:00]  So he takes us both up to the front, and I'm like really scared that they're going to do something to my girlfriend  because, you know, she looked good.  And so I just kept telling her, look down.  Don't look at his face.  I mean, he's a ski mask, but like don't let him think you're trying to identify him.  Just look down.  Just look down.  And the guy's like, it's going to be all right.  No one's going to get hurt.  Just do what we tell you.  And the guy came out.  With the pistol.  And they left.  And they got into a car and took off.  But it was scary, man.  Wow, yeah.  You have no idea what's going to happen.  Yeah.  It was very scary.  What if they would have taken her? 
[00:37:30]  You know, in hindsight, I should have offered her up.  I don't know what a C she's going to turn into.  Good luck, guys.  Godspeed.  Could you please take her off my hands?  She gets lippy.  A pistol whipping wouldn't be out of order.  Wow.  Does it annoy you that there's no, like,  no retribution?  There's no, you, wouldn't you like to have them in front of you with you having all the  power and say, you know, something you mother, and just like bash their faces in? 
[00:38:00]  In that circumstance, no.  I'll tell you why.  Why?  They didn't rob us as individuals, and nobody got hurt.  They didn't, the guys, he did what he said, they came there strictly for cash.  They didn't come to hurt anybody.  I'm not saying it's right, but an armed robber to me who actually just takes your money and  goes, he took, no, I wouldn't.  I would be, no.  Oh, you're a nice guy.  But there'd be nothing I would say to him because the guy was in complete control of  us.  How about you scared the crap out of me?  Okay.  You bastard.  But it could have been worse.  He was in complete control.  That's all they did.  Cave your teeth in. 
[00:38:30]  There's a lot worse people.  Yeah.  There was a guy I heard disrespecting Ozzy Osbourne.  I would rather cave his teeth in.  Oh, well, obviously.  Well, there you go.  That's, that's, that's pretty good.  You're forgiving.  No kidding.  That's something that's, like, is beyond forgiveness for me.  If somebody puts me in that situation, I will just spend the rest of my life gritting  my teeth and insane that I can't get some kind of revenge.  But have you ever been, like, where a guy has a pistol in a robbery like that?  It's weird.  It's not like the Stockholm Syndrome or whatever it's called, where you're a munch house and 
[00:39:00]  whatever the hell it is, where you become, like, you know, bonded with your captors.  But in that, I understood it in a way, like, this guy's robbing a store of their money.  They're not looking to do anything to me or my chick.  We just happen to be here.  All I want is our hands up.  That's a fine line, though.  There are people that do break into the stores and shoot the people in the head.  Yeah.  To me, that's a, well, that's a completely different type of person.  It's like a guy who robs a house and then a guy who robs a house and rapes a woman.  You don't think those people are capable of doing that? 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  I think there have been occasions where they went in to do exactly what they did in your  situation, but they end up killing somebody because they go into a panic.  Someone like that lady, oh, my God, oh, my God, running out of the store makes the person  go, oh, God.  Off-duty cop is in there.  He pulls his gun.  What do you think they're going to do?  Of course, do it.  Yeah.  Without a doubt.  Yeah.  Shoot.  I'm only talking about the interaction me and my girlfriend had with him.  Like, that's what I want, retribution.  And it's like, no, because nothing happened.  You didn't feel violated at all, even though they didn't take your money? 
[00:40:00]  No.  Had it been in my apartment or something, of course I would have.  But because it was a McDonald's and it was just, I could comprehend it in a weird way.  I'm not justifying it.  I mean, he was obviously a criminal.  Off-duty cop was there.  He probably would have been shot if he pulled his gun.  There's no explaining it.  I just personally didn't want any retribution because he didn't bother me.  I can't give it his case, Ringo.  They were okay with us.  And unfortunately, Tango and Cash weren't there to slide in and say funny things.  With their bad over-the-top acting. 
[00:40:30]  All right, we're going to take a break, but I think we might play Guess the Sound today.  We've got two of them.  Two sounds.  Here's the first one.  I think I know that.  Really?  Yeah.  One more time?  You really think you know that one?  Yeah.  Did you look at the answer?  No, but I think I do.  I know what that is.  All right, what is it?  It's a deaf man singing happy birthday to you.  I actually was trying to cover for you, but you had to stop this show. 
[00:41:00]  So now I don't deserve to be covered for it unless it's with a plastic bag with my fat face.  Back goes Griffey looking up, and it's out of here!  Or is it?  No, it's off the wall. 
[00:41:30]  My mistake.  Yeah, your mistake.  Yeah.  All right.  You really know what that is, Ant?  I think I do.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right, go ahead.  Sounds familiar.  Go ahead, go.  Is it a guy being tased?  No.  Okay.  I didn't think so.  I didn't hear that crackle.  You want the second sound?  We got two today.  Yeah.  We're doing a double. 
[00:42:00]  All right.  I don't guess that sound.  That's good.  Want to hear that one again?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  She sounds sad.  What do you think, Jimmy?  Jimmy's girlfriend at a McDonald's?  What do you think? 
[00:42:30]  By the way, the first one, a lot of people say it has something to do with a spanking.  No.  Not that either, huh?  It's not that easy.  I'll guess it was from Bad Boys with Sean Penn.  Yeah.  No?  No.  No?  All right.  We'll see if someone could get either one of these.  We got two of them today.  I like this one.  By the way.  I like that one.  We'll take some of your answers next. 
[00:43:00]  Yes, Jimmy.  Quick question.  Who made up this one sheet on DL Hughley?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Why?  Sam, because he left a word out.  What was the word?  He wrote very good things about DL, but one of the things he...  I'll ask him when he comes in.  I want to see if he can figure out what he missed.  He left it out because we buried that word.  No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, my God.  What?  We have to take a break.  What?  We'll do it when we come back.  All right.  Yeah, let's do that.  Okay.  Let's see if Sam can figure out what he did wrong.  All right.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:43:30]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Lots going on this morning.  Later on, we got DL Hughley stopping in.  We're going to talk to Michael Moore.  What else?  What else?  What else?  What else?  What else?  What else?  I have some impressions.  Are you working on a new impression, Jimmy?  I knew it had to be thrown in there.  I just figured that there's maybe a couple people that haven't heard a couple of the ones I've been doing. 
[00:44:00]  I do guys from the 70s.  That's what I do.  Oh, from the 70s.  Yes.  It's very entertaining.  Ralph from Belleville.  Belleville.  He's good for one or two every morning on the NCAA feedback when he's not bitching about the show.  Opie, where the heck is Jill Nicolini?  I've been watching Channel 11 since 6 a.m.  and no Jill TV this morning.  Can't get through on the phones.  Can't get through my morning without seeing Jill's headlights, even though one is much bigger than the other one.  Let us know where is Jill.  Well, it's funny you should say that, Ralph, because every morning we watch Jill TV as we're getting ready for the radio show. 
[00:44:30]  People in here in New York know it as the Channel 11 morning news.  But the rest of America just knows it's Jill TV.  Jill TV.  It's all about Jill Nicolini.  She does the traffic.  She wears lingerie pretty much in the morning as she tells all of the Tri-State area where the traffic jams might be.  Right, right, right.  And we got a TV dedicated to Jill TV.  We screen cap her every day.  We throw the screen cap on our website so you can get involved with the radio show and involved with Jill TV. 
[00:45:00]  And when we notice that she's not in, then we come up with some excuse for her in the office.  And today's excuse, we think it's that she stayed out late for Thirsty Thursdays at some bar in Center Reach.  Out in Center Reach?  That's what I'm going with.  Thirsty Thursdays.  Some bar in the Center Reach area.  Could you imagine what that called?  So she had a call in sick today.  Guys, I can't make it in today.  It's really, um, my throat's kind of feeling a little scratchy.  I don't think I'd make it through the traffic. 
[00:45:30]  She takes a lot of time off.  And we think it's because, you know, she's a Long Island party girl.  I really, I'll be in, I'll be in, um, Monday though.  Have a good weekend.  Jill, who are you talking to?  Oh, wait.  Shh.  I'm on the phone with my boss.  Shh.  What's your name again?  It's the fantasy right there.  Yeah, of course.  Jill at Thirsty Thursdays.  Thirsty.  Thirsty Thursdays.  I came up with Thirsty Thursdays with some bar.  I'm going to get real specific.  I'm going to start naming bars now. 
[00:46:00]  I'm just saying some bar in the Center Reach area.  Yeah.  They had Thirsty Thursdays.  The fantasy is, wait, what's your name again?  Anthony.  Yeah, who are you kidding?  But I'm here listening.  Guess the, oh, uh, Sam.  Oh, yes.  Good call.  Sam.  We went to break with a fine radio tease by our own little Jimmy Norton, who has a book  out called Happy Endings.  And he's going to be signing books later on today.  Where?  I'll be in Washington, D.C.  Washington.  Barnes & Noble on 3040 M Street Northwest. 
[00:46:30]  I'll be there at 7.30 p.m.  And then tomorrow I go to, uh, uh, Cheekawaga and Rochester.  Buffalo, Rochester.  No, you don't.  Yeah.  Cheekawaga?  Cheekawaga.  Stop with the Indian name.  Cheekawaga.  I'm near Buffalo in borders and Rochester.  Yeah.  Tomorrow.  Cheekawaga.  Um, Sam, do you have the one sheet on the, uh, the very, uh.  Uh, first, Sam, a little quiz.  When you have a DVD or CD, actually CD, they are divided up into what?  They are called what? 
[00:47:00]  Uh-oh.  Chapters?  No.  Stop giggling.  CDs have different...  Titles?  Tracks?  Let's see.  I said it too much.  Before, when he just naturally was talking, he said, uh, it's on Cheek, Cheek 1, Cheek 2.  You say it normally.  Trek.  No, no, he's going track.  Track.  Check.  Track.  Check.  Track.  You're from...  More importantly, what did you have for dinner last night? 
[00:47:30]  Yes, I want a dinner update.  Sam eats like an eight-year-old, everyone.  Yes.  Well, last night, uh, I got some chicken tenders.  We should actually have maybe that...  Like, I want kitty music playing when he gives his little update on what he had for dinner.  All right.  We got a lot of people listening.  They got, uh, you know, children around eight years old.  Yeah.  Well, Sam eats just like your child.  Yeah.  We'll prove it right now.  No difference between him and a child. 
[00:48:00]  And Sam, you swear you don't make this up, right, for the radio.  No, no, no.  Okay, thank you.  All right.  So what did you have for dinner last night?  It wasn't that bad.  It was, uh, chicken tenders and buffalo wings from Whole Foods, and then some, some baby  carrots and milk.  And it was milk.  Milk with chicken wings.  Oh, God.  And we never smell your farts.  Do you even pass gas?  Everyone else does.  I'm a gentleman.  And chicken wings and milk.  But baby carrots? 
[00:48:30]  Well, small carrots.  Yeah.  Were they, uh, cooked or raw?  No, I don't eat cooked carrots.  No.  Uh, and he, he just writes it off like, nah, nah, stop it.  I don't eat cooked carrots.  So you, you're sitting there just going, crunching him.  I'll bet every time he crunches him, the sound makes him giggle.  And he's wearing diapers with no shirt, and he kicks his stupid feet.  His girlfriend gives him to him when he's sad, but the crunch will make him giggle.  Well, and then, uh, you have to have dessert every night. 
[00:49:00]  Sam is one of these guys.  He has to have dessert every single horse.  And it's some kitty dessert.  It's a child.  Go ahead.  What, what was the dessert?  Well, maybe it was a good humor ice cream bar and, uh, maybe some frosted animal cookies.  Maybe.  Frosted animal cookies?  What do you, do you get all excited when you hear the ice cream man coming down the street?  Maybe, yeah, I mean, who doesn't, though? 
[00:49:30]  That was really funny.  By the way, we're working our asses off here.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're working our asses off here.  We, we talk for five hours almost every day.  Nah.  Because I'll say five hours every day, and then on the message board,  no, that's not true, actually.  Tuesday, they left 15 minutes early.  I wouldn't put it as working our asses off.  Why didn't you say they gave us 10 minutes of extra time?  But then, on Thursday, they left a half hour early. 
[00:50:00]  Copy, paste, copy, paste, copy, paste.  Blind CC with fake name.  Blind CC with fake name.  Blind CC with fake name.  So I'm too, too scared to show my real name and face.  You just drooled.  That was so great.  We do put in a lot of hours.  Oh, they listened to every effing word we say on this show.  I actually went on the message boards for the first time in a while.  Last night.  And I was thinking, you know what?  We had a really good trip to Philly.  We did some crazy, crazy stuff in those studios at YSP. 
[00:50:30]  I want to get the feel of the fans and what they thought of the Philly shows, right?  Mm-hmm.  Not only did they not bitch about this show, they didn't even talk about our Philly radio show.  It's mutated beyond that.  It's mutated into them just talking about themselves.  They talk about other board members, other boards.  It was kind of depressing because I'm like, wow, they're not even talking about the show anymore.  They specialize on things like they'll specialize on Jimmy's book signing type of a thing or Big A's operation. 
[00:51:00]  It's now a big community of people.  Big A's operation went very well, by the way.  Hopefully we'll get an update later.  Oh, thank God.  When a message board just starts, it's about what the message board is about.  But after a while, it mutates because the people get to know each other more.  It becomes like a communication hub for everybody on the message board.  That just happens.  It's a natural progression of a message board.  And a little tip.  Someone will say, well, we do talk about the show. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, they have a listening thread.  Well, the listening thread, I'll tell you, there's a lot of people that just go to the message boards  and they're not going to dig through a listening thread to see people talking about the radio show.  They're just not.  That's too much work.  Too much work.  Like, but anyway, it was kind of like, all right, well, I went to the boards yesterday  and I was like, okay, they're not really talking about the show good or bad.  No, you'll get, you know, what type of meat do you like to eat? 
[00:52:00]  Just an observation.  Things like that.  We do some heavy lifting every morning.  We talk for four or five hours.  Some of this stuff sticks and some of this stuff, yeah, sure, we fall flat on our asses.  But local TV today is all over the fact that CBS FM is back on the air here in New York.  CBS, a couple of years back, I guess, was turned into one of the Jack radio stations,  which is supposed to be like your iPod.  That's the theory behind the Jack format.  It's like your iPod. 
[00:52:30]  A bunch of different songs, a bunch of different styles.  And they just, you know, run the tunes.  Right.  Well, they had taken CBS FM, which was the oldie station here in New York,  off the air and replaced it with this Jack format a couple of years ago.  Much to the chagrin of a lot of the CBS fans who are falling down with their graham cracker hips.  But they missed their doo-wop music, I guess.  And it's back. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  It's back.  It's been brought back.  And it's going to do very well.  It really is.  It's going to do much better than Jack did.  But this is the problem I have.  So you got all the local...  Der-wop, der-wop, der-wop, der-wop, der-wop, der-wop, der.  All right.  This is the problem I have, though.  All the local news stations are in the CBS FM studios yesterday and today talking to jukeboxes.  Mm-hmm.  Talking to the personalities that aren't really personalities.  The jocks and Mr. G, who's the weather guy. 
[00:53:30]  They don't...  Mr. G.  They don't do anything.  Yeah, it's pretty much...  They intro songs and give you a quick weather break.  And they're getting all this attention there.  They supposedly have a lot of personality, from what I read.  If you use an echo behind you, you have no personality.  That's why they use the echo, to kind of spice up what babble you have to say.  They give you little tidbits of information about maybe the year that the song came out. 
[00:54:00]  That's their job.  Yeah.  And the 60s, guess who couldn't vote?  Stupid.  But they could write music.  Here's Marvin Gaye.  Let me tell you something.  CBS FM is going to be like an iPod with dementia.  Nobody wants to hear that dumb echo anymore.  But I'm happy they brought it back.  I think it's cool.  Are you?  Yeah, Jack annoyed me, even though I like the music.  I like the music.  I just don't like the, uh-oh, we're getting pretty nutty hair. 
[00:54:30]  Hold on to your hats.  It's anything we want.  Yeah, anything goes, kind of, but it doesn't.  The problem with the Jack stations, they're competing with iPods.  Obviously, that's the whole concept.  And you're not going to program a radio station better than someone's iPods.  You've got to give them something else besides that.  Yeah.  So they went on the air, and it was like no jocks, just playing what they thought was like  a lot of interesting tunes.  And it wasn't interesting tunes.  It was the same playlist.  So now, apparently, the CBS oldies station is playing 80s music, too? 
[00:55:00]  Is that considered oldies now?  Well, 1980s, 27 years ago or so.  Jeez, that's right.  I guess so.  The Bangles' Hazy Shade of Winter was being played.  Oh, really?  The Bangles are oldies.  When's it changing over?  Uh, yesterday.  Yeah, yesterday.  This is the second day on the air.  Oh, haven't you watched the news?  They've been showing the inside the studios.  They have one of the reporters from the CW11 over there, and she's dressed in 50s attire.  Yeah. 
[00:55:30]  But they're playing 80s songs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Well, they came back at 101.1 p.m.  Oh.  I get it.  And they played Do It Again by Steely Dan.  Whackalicious.  And you know what Jack's last song was?  What?  Don't Stop Believin'.  Was it?  Yeah.  So what does that mean?  I don't know.  Does that mean you're going to bring Jack back somewhere else?  I don't know. 
[00:56:00]  You went in one format with Don't Stop Believin', so that gives hope to the people that like  the Jack format.  Someone's great idea.  Like, don't Stop Believin'.  We'll be back.  But we're going to do it again with the whole deal.  Oh, well, thank God.  Jack is staying on on HD Radio, Opie.  HD Radio.  Do you have your HD receiver?  Yes.  HD.  That is just no one I know, and I'm in the business. 
[00:56:30]  You're going to piss off people in corporate.  Knows about HD Radio.  I'm hoping this is going to take off.  Well, let me tell you something in corporate.  Do something that lets people know, first of all, what the hell it is.  Because here's what I don't even know.  They call it HD.  Yeah.  HD has nothing to do with high definition, by the way.  I didn't know that.  It's just two letters they pulled out of their keisters.  Well, because HD sounds cool.  Sounds cool and new and modern.  So that's why they call it HD.  It doesn't have anything to do with high definition.  What does it mean?  It means HD. 
[00:57:00]  See, they figured out a way to take your radio signal that your regular radio station's on.  And splice it.  And splice it a little bit.  And put another, like, station in there somewhere that's got to be picked up with a special receiver.  It's all digital.  So they put it in there, and now you can get that.  But you need a special receiver and everything.  But wait.  Well, wait.  Wait a minute.  Don't get me crazy.  If I buy, who cares about a satellite?  If I buy an HD, are you telling me I can still get Jack? 
[00:57:30]  Yes.  If you can find it.  Because I don't really know how the HD technology works.  I don't know how HD works either.  I don't even know what you tune in.  Is it letters, numbers?  What do you do?  But you're telling me I can still get Jack if I get HD.  Absolutely.  I'm speechless.  Yes, so am I.  All right.  I can't get over how happy I am.  Oh, I thought you were going to say I can't get over how much I could give a crap.  Oh, no.  Why would I be sarcastic?  I'm happy about it. 
[00:58:00]  Can we help CBS FM this morning maybe play some of the audio the news is getting?  I'm sure it's just terrific stuff.  Oh, yeah.  CBS FM!  Yeah.  Hello, love!  You might remember this one from 1977 from the movie Grease.  Do you think Sirius is mad they gave Cousin Brucie $308 million?  Anyway, we got Sam.  So, you had a problem with Sam.  We go back to Sam.  I'm back.  I'm in the hot seat.  His eight-year-old diet. 
[00:58:30]  Now we just have a problem with Sam.  Well, Sam.  I was trying to do Quincy, but I can't do it.  The Biles are good.  Oh, the Biles.  Oh.  I can't do it because he's not Asian.  I know.  He's not like the Sam I know and love.  You're not Robert Edo.  You had the diet of a baby, Sam.  Oh, that's it.  Perfect.  You know, if you're crying, I'm going to give you carrots to make you smile, Sam.  Aw.  Little Sam. 
[00:59:00]  So, what was your dessert?  It was a good humor ice cream bar and maybe some frosted animal cookies.  What's your favorite frosted animal cookie?  Well, I don't necessarily have a favorite animal, but they come with pink and white frosting.  I prefer the pink ones.  Do you take the horse and break the ass end off it and just look at it and go, I know how you feel?  God.  All right.  So, with Sam, what's up?  I want to see if Sam can take a copy of D.L. Hughley's one shoot. 
[00:59:30]  I'd like you to read what you wrote about D.L.  In Quigley.  Okay.  Not as Caroline's gig tonight through Sunday, but I'm saying from the bottom.  From the bottom.  D.L.'s also.  According to Wikipedia there.  Why is this happening?  All right.  No, Sam, just start reading.  You said from the bottom.  Just want to remind everyone in the studio we're talking to a million people.  All right.  Go ahead, Sam.  Maybe a little energy.  Sam.  The D.L. is promoting the new reality hidden camera show he is hosting on BET, SOB, Socially 
[01:00:00]  Offensive Behavior.  The show premieres a week from Wednesday on July 25th at 10 p.m.  and will air Wednesday nights after that.  Keep going.  D.L. just shot a one-hour special for HBO called Unapologetic, which will air September 29th.  He was one of the few comics who came out in support of free speech during the I Miss Controversy.  He plays Simon Stiles on the NBC.  Let me stop you here.  I want you to go back over all the stuff you read and think if you left a word out somewhere. 
[01:00:30]  I don't have the sheet, I mean. 
[01:01:00]  Danny, do you have the answer?  I think I caught it.  All right.  What is it?  Is it the fact that he mentions D.L.'s new show and then fails to mention what station  it's on?  No.  I said on BET.  Oh.  You got to listen to your radio.  Oh.  I tried to tune you out.  Oh.  What?  I tune you out.  It's kind of like a radio thing.  Yeah, yeah.  What was the word, Jimmy?  Uh, black.  He was one of the few comics in support of free speech of I Miss. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, a lot of comics.  Almost every comic.  Coming out.  Yeah, almost every comic understood.  But he was pretty much the only black comic.  Yeah.  Yeah, because like, uh, stupid Steve Harvey, who does radio here in New York, was outraged.  Whoopi was outraged.  And they're comedians.  Yeah.  But they didn't understand the whole thing.  Steve Harvey does a whole redneck, uh, bit.  Which, you know, fine, let him do it, but you then should not, uh, chastise another  radio personality for doing some kind of a racial stereotype. 
[01:02:00]  I didn't mean to make that into a 40 minute bit.  It was only because.  But it is a good point.  It makes comics look like we're a bunch of, and this is all comics, not just me, but  a bunch of sissies who thought that was tasteless, he should be fired.  Why did you do that, Sam?  Well, I kind of meant in a mainstream way, like on Leno or something.  You didn't see any other comics on Leno.  They wouldn't be allowed to do what D.L.  Hughley did.  That's the only reason.  They were all clamoring to get on Leno to talk about the Ima situation. 
[01:02:30]  Trust me on that.  Yeah, everybody was.  All right.  So D.L.  Hughley will be in in 40 minutes.  Yes.  Uh, guess the sound.  We'll take a few of these before the break.  So we got two today.  We got this one.  It's not a spanking.  That, see, I would have thought it would.  That's too obvious, though.  And, uh, I'll give this much away.  Uh, nothing is being slammed.  Hmm.  An electric shock.  What the hell is that noise, then?  And then we got the second one. 
[01:03:00]  Second one, much more interesting.  I think I know what it is.  Let's say hi to Brian in New Hampshire.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, that second sound is the last sound Jimmy Norton hears before he slams his trunk closed.  Thud.  Let's go to Eric in, uh, Pennsylvania. 
[01:03:30]  Looks like the Philly area.  What's up, Eric?  Hey, guys.  Uh, I was just calling to say thank you for an awesome show yesterday.  It was just amazing.  Yeah, we had a lot of fun, uh, down there at YSP.  Well, I wanted to really thank Sam.  Um, he, I was sitting in front with my girlfriend that you guys had a lot of fun with yesterday.  Yeah.  And, uh, I wanted to thank, I'm sorry?  Nothing.  I said, all right, I remember her.  Yes.  And I just wanted to thank Sam because, uh, you know, he took our, he took our shirts back to you guys and got them autographed. 
[01:04:00]  And that was really cool.  And, uh, it was just an amazing show.  And, uh, my girlfriend really had a great time.  Uh, thanks, Eric.  Thank you.  What was, uh, what was your favorite part of our two days at, uh, YSP?  Oh, I'm not far.  Oh, wow.  That could be.  Mark the date.  Oh, no.  Mark the date.  And it's because I'm a little tired.  Oh, no.  He's too big a fan.  He knew.  Oh, no.  That could be the first failure ever. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Don't do it to me.  Don't do it to me, Charlie.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I only got three bits and I might have lost one today.  No, wait.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I, I think.  I know what he was going to say.  That did not fail.  That bit did not fail.  No.  No.  You guys are wrong.  What happened?  What he was saying.  Yeah.  Was I am not falling for the old pick your favorite bit gag because I loved all of them. 
[01:05:00]  And for me to pick a favorite would imply that I loved others less.  Beko's Holiday.  He's on the track.  He's at the wall.  She's gone.  The milkman delivered.  Now, what are they saying?  You got it right.  All right.  There it is.  All right.  I'm back.  Yes or no?  Oh, you added an extra E.  Oh.  Ow.  You are never to blame. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, no.  I've made an ass of myself.  I'm sorry I did that.  Oh, no.  I'm embarrassed that I did that.  Oh, no.  This is a sad day.  Oh, no.  It's hysterical.  Can't wait for that.  God.  No.  No.  Oh, my.  I'll tell you something.  How did that not go in?  Yeah.  How did it not go in?  No.  No.  Well.  Everyone's pointing and laughing at me.  That does.  Yeah.  Including Kevin from Connecticut. 
[01:06:00]  I'm getting some feedback.  And I was quick, too, man.  I almost got it done.  Oh, you went for the hang-up so quick on that one.  Because I wasn't feeling confident.  I knew Philly was too smart.  They nailed you.  It's over, Johnny.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to John in Yonkers.  John, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Good.  I think I have an answer for the first sound.  All right.  I'm thinking someone getting hit with, like, a mousetrap or a rat trap, like, on their  hand or somewhere. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  We said it has nothing to do with spanking or slapping or something coming down hard.  Okay.  I lose.  I'm out.  All right.  So that's not really.  Let's go to Nelson in Massachusetts.  Is the sound being made?  Yeah.  Nelson, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I have an answer for both of them, if I could.  All right.  First one, a guy getting, like, his back waxed or his chest waxed.  Or something like that?  Yeah.  That doesn't sound like a waxed strip being removed.  No.  No. 
[01:07:00]  No.  And what's the second one?  Second one is a girl getting tickled and laughing.  That's tickled.  You creep.  That's how you tickle girls?  She doesn't seem to be enjoying anything in that clip.  With a knife.  Yeah.  Let's go to Tom the Trucker.  Tom.  I'd like to take this opportunity to point and laugh at Opie.  Ha, ha, ha.  Point and laugh Friday.  Well, how about the laugh, sir?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:07:30]  That's how it works.  My God.  All right, Tom.  Thanks.  Um, hmm.  Another answer, Anthony?  Yeah.  Can I read it?  It's from Doug from Boston.  Okay.  Shot with an air rifle.  Ooh, which one?  Come on.  No.  No.  I say he was zapped with something.  Jimmy's on.  On to something.  Ah, okay.  There's a shock.  Um.  Finger and a bug zapper. 
[01:08:00]  No.  Um.  He, uh, he touched his toe to an electric mousetrap.  No.  I can't.  I don't.  I don't, uh.  It's, uh, we're talking about the, uh, the one area.  You definitely want to leave alone.  No way.  Yeah.  Electrodes?  You just want to leave that area alone.  Oops, that's the other one.  I will tell you after the break. 
[01:08:30]  Damn it.  And this time we will.  Better.  All right.  Maybe someone will get it on the, uh, the phone lines.  Okay?  All right.  Also, after the break, Scott Baio has a small one.  Right?  And Joni's telling everybody.  Joni tells all.  Details on the way.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Uh, Jimmy, can you help me out?  I babbled through it the first time.  We got a $10 ticket Tuesday promotion going on for the O&M. 
[01:09:00]  A traveling virus comedy show.  Yeah, well, what we're doing is, um, for Detroit, Washington, D.C., and PNC and Homestyle,  for those three gigs, $10 lawn seats, 9 a.m. on Tuesday until midnight Tuesday.  And this is what a lot of the fans have been waiting for.  It's finally here.  This is your only shot to get, uh, $10 tickets.  Yes.  Now, as a special thank you to Philadelphia, because, uh, the, the, the crowds came out  both days.  Everything we asked for, they did. 
[01:09:30]  It was great.  Actually, we're just, uh, bribing them to listen to us instead of pressing it, Steve.  Let's be honest with each other.  It's a more emotional blackmail thing.  But make it sound like, you know, where this is a thank you to them, because they were so  cool to us in Philly.  Well, as a bribe.  As a bribe to continue listening to a humorous show, instead of those sound-obsessed, we  have a whole jizzbuckets.  All right.  That's all right.  Take two.  Take two, Jimmy.  Instead of those silly geese. 
[01:10:00]  I can't say the J bucket words.  No.  $10 lawn seats.  Uh, $10 lawn tickets from 9 a.m. Tuesday until Friday at 5 p.m.  It's a longer one on, uh, and, uh, on, on, for them.  And, uh, we're doing a military giveaway in, um, our Boston show.  Like a big cluster F.  You're just as bad as I was.  It's hard.  There's three different ones.  We'll see if Anthony does a better job later in the show.  He won't.  Detroit, D.C., PNC.  Now, unless, of course, you're going to Philly. 
[01:10:30]  But then again, if you're in the Army and you're in Boston, lucky you.  How about this?  Buy a ticket or die.  Go to virus tour.  One word on MySpace.  I'm sure it's all, like, laid out nicely for you.  It's unbelievable.  On our MySpace.  Here's the thing.  Slash virus tour.  One word.  And brought to you by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  Always worth it.  Yes, Jimmy.  Go ahead.  Uh, the Washington, D.C. tickets.  I will be having special information tonight at my bookshop.  Wow.  Wow.  Barnes and Noble.  What?  Can I not give special information because I care about this show? 
[01:11:00]  There's a special code word.  Absolutely.  A special code word you give where you will be able to get these tickets.  Yeah.  Bleh.  Oh, yeah.  The code word.  Bleh.  Bleh.  Bleh.  No, yours sounded stupid.  Bleh.  Bleh.  When other DJs promote stuff, it's so smooth.  It's like, they get the info out.  It's very clear to the listener what they need to know.  It's concise.  Yeah, concise.  Now we give out.  We just babble and stumble and fall over ourselves.  Well, how about this?  I don't know where to go.  Yeah.  Because the ticket promotion for three of the four cities, they all start at the same 
[01:11:30]  time.  Right.  9 a.m.  Tuesday, $10 lawn tickets.  That's good for Detroit, D.C., PNC, Philly.  That's perfectly clear.  Perfectly.  However, if you live in Detroit, D.C. or PNC, you better buy them by midnight Tuesday or  else.  However, Philly.  If you live in Philly.  Because we love them the best.  We certainly do.  That's what I would think if I was a listener. 
[01:12:00]  Why does Philly get the special treatment?  Yeah.  Because they were good to us.  No.  You don't need to rush.  Because we need ratings in Philly.  No, that's not why.  We don't care about ratings.  And it's time to ask your friends.  If they're listening to Preston and Steve, it's time to just point at them and go, why?  Why?  Because I certainly don't get it.  And then when they give you some kind of explanation why they listen to Preston and  Steve, just openly laugh at them.  Like, oh, you stink.  Laugh.  What happened to being cool, man?  And then say, here's what you have to do.  You grab them by the lapels and you shake them and you go, they have a hole. 
[01:12:30]  Exactly.  That's enough.  Right.  That says it right there.  And then the military thing.  Oh, of course.  You get in free a week from Saturday if you present a military ID.  Yes, if you have a military ID and an Iraqi sword.  That's often.  Which you have to swing at somebody.  In humor.  In humor.  In humor.  All right.  Guess the sound or Scott Bale?  What do you want to do?  What do you want to do?  What do you want to do?  I would say guess the sound has to be finished. 
[01:13:00]  To finish, get the sound.  For once, we're going to finish a bit.  So what is this sound?  Guy yelling.  Huh?  Man yelling after a sound.  Let me know if Al lets this go through there, E-Rock.  Brian from Jersey is going to attempt to guess the sound.  Go ahead, Brian.  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  I've been trying to think of a good way to explain this.  Here it goes.  Okay.  It sounds quite like a gentleman with some sort of conduit wrapped around his nether regions, 
[01:13:30]  placing it into an electrical socket and therefore getting a little charge out of an area you don't want to be zapped.  Yeah.  Okay.  Is that it?  Did he dump out?  No.  Is that it?  Thumbs up to Brian in Jersey.  He got it.  He got it.  And it got through.  Yes.  Brian, you're made for radio, buddy.  By him and the audio.  And by the way, you get nothing. 
[01:14:00]  Wouldn't that be great if we had a prize closet to go to?  We do.  Where we could just say, hey, you win.  All right.  I think we got prize closet.  That encourages people to call.  Yeah.  Basically, it's a man who has put tinfoil on a part uniquely identifiable to a man.  This was what was written out to us.  Right.  Basically, read this and it'll go through.  Yeah.  Makes two points on the foil.  Uh-huh.  And then inserts the foil into an electrical socket.  We don't recommend anybody at home try this unless you want to. 
[01:14:30]  And there you go.  And that's the sound.  Wow.  Very good, Brian.  Hold on to the line.  We'll give you something from our fine prize closet.  Basically, it's like SNL best ofs.  Preston and Steve suck.  Huh?  I said Preston and Steve suck.  All right.  Hold on to the line.  Thank you, sir.  Atta boy.  And then the second sound for today.  That is a woman either laughing or crying.  Yeah, that is pleasure or pain. 
[01:15:00]  Can't quite figure it out.  Um, I think it starts with a little pleasure and ends with a lot of pain.  Really?  Oh, my God.  I'm looking at the video of the guy.  What a sick F.  Oh, let me see.  Can we get this video up on our website?  Look at this sick F.  Ah.  And then the lights go out in his house or in the room?  The love plug.  What is wrong with people?  Watch this.  I know it's radio.  I'm sorry.  Yeah. 
[01:15:30]  I have to, um...  Where can they find this video, man?  We got to share this with everybody.  You can't really say the name of the website.  Why?  Oh, yeah.  I see why.  Oh, my God.  I think I'm going to call shenanigans.  Really?  On his, uh...  Well, there's a lot of fake videos out there.  We understand that.  No, I'm calling shenanigans on the fact that my limited knowledge, yet extensive knowledge  of everything...  Why do you have to be so smart?  Uh, well, I...  You take away the fun from this radio show by using stupid facts and knowledge. 
[01:16:00]  The prongs that he made on the tinfoil...  Yeah.  ...do not go to his, uh, flesh before they meet each other, which would short-circuit.  That is a short happening, and it is not zapping him.  You could hold on to that thing and put it in there.  You could hold on to a fork.  Don't try it at home.  Believe me, don't try it at home.  Just in case you do it wrong.  But you could hold on to a fork, take the tines, and stick it into a socket and not be 
[01:16:30]  electrocuted.  What?  I didn't know that.  By just holding on to the one metal piece.  Because once the metal joins...  Yeah.  ...you get a short circuit, and you'll blow the fuse, but the energy will not go...  The electricity will not go through the handle into your hand.  You get what I'm saying?  Yeah, I do.  Whatever it is...  Which takes the fun out of the show.  Oh, so what happens?  I'm sorry.  How can you get shocked?  You would be able to get shocked if he took two pieces of tinfoil, let's say, and taped 
[01:17:00]  it one to each side of his...  Whatever.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then shoved it into the wall like that.  Now you're using yourself to make the short, to complete the circuit.  See, he's not using his body at all to complete the circuit.  What you need is your flesh to complete a circuit.  That is just the tinfoil that he's making the prongs out of completing the circuit, shorting  it out, and that's it.  I think you're wrong.  Okay.  I think a lot of times whenever you put something in a socket, it could hurt.  It could. 
[01:17:30]  You're absolutely right.  It could.  Maybe it's the sound he's making is like, you know, he's kind of scared.  Like, oh my God.  Well, that could be.  And then there's relief that he didn't really get shot.  Or this, it could have heated up the foil enough where the heat itself would have hurt  him.  But I don't think there was enough time for that to happen.  And there's a lot of foil between the prongs and where his flesh would be.  There's a long portion of foil and then the prongs.  So I'm calling shenanigans. 
[01:18:00]  But the video is hilarious.  The video is very funny.  I don't call, I don't think it's shenanigans.  He actually is, you know.  Oh, he's doing it.  He's blowing a fuse.  But the shenanigans part is him actually being hurt by this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe.  See, it's a guy that knows exactly what Ant's talking about and knows that this would make  a great video and he wouldn't get hurt.  Very funny.  Oh, well.  I wanted to buy into it.  You're sweet.  And the second sound, Jimmy? 
[01:18:30]  It's a woman.  Yeah.  It's a woman.  Yeah.  That's all I know.  Yeah.  Travis, screening calls?  It's a woman.  I wish I could read the real one.  Should I read the real one and just let Al dump?  And then read the fake?  Not the fake one.  Can I see the real one?  I won't say it.  Yeah.  Number two on that.  It's obviously fake. 
[01:19:00]  Well, I got a way we can say it.  Enjoying an apple.  Enjoying an apple.  Holy Jesus.  Not enjoying an apple.  That conjured up one image in my head.  Well, there's a couple possibilities.  There could be.  There's definitely still a couple possibilities.  Well, let me think about this.  There could be. 
[01:19:30]  Wait.  Is this the video?  What is wrong?  What the hell is wrong, you guys?  Is that an orange?  No, that's an apple.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  What is wrong?  Oh.  Why?  Who put the apple back?  Oh, my God.  Oh, okay.  That's the one?  Yeah.  Well, that's a green apple.  Wow.  This should be a Granny Smith commercial. 
[01:20:00]  So many places you can place an apple.  That's someone.  Wow.  That's someone's daughter.  My God, man.  Once when I was a kid, I got apples like that for Halloween.  They're on a stick.  Yeah.  And they're, uh, it's not the cherry, uh, covered, uh, uh, apple.  I believe they're called Caramel Apple.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  Good egg.  Remember I said there were two possibilities? 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  She also knew that there were two possibilities.  I never would have guessed that.  No.  No.  Nobody would have.  Oh, wow.  Oh, there it is.  There it is.  We can't even mention the website.  Well, how about this?  Wow.  Use your imagination and just, uh, Google Apple popping out.  That?  And you might get there eventually.  Whoa.  First time.  Does, does, does it come flying out here?  No, no, no. 
[01:21:00]  No?  I don't think so.  Oh, there it is.  Wow.  That looked like a pirate cannon.  Yeah, but firing, firing a cannonball, like a foot, and then it drops into the ocean.  Yeah.  A very ineffective cannon.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  We, uh, we got to squeeze in Scott Baio here.  This is terrific.  There's a new show on.  Sounds like that should be easy from what, uh, the news is.  Ha, ha, ha.  No kidding, man.  Oh, don't be fresh.  Yeah.  He's got a new show, uh, VH1, that celeb reality thing they do.  I love the celeb reality.  Celeb reality. 
[01:21:30]  I can't say the word.  Takes our celebs.  I love their programming.  The celeb reality.  And makes reality shows with them.  Dice's show sucked.  That was the first celeb reality show that sucked.  Because Dice sucks.  You know.  But they got Scott Baio.  Uh, he's got a show called 45 and Single.  If you know anything about Scott Baio, he lost his virginity to, uh, Joanie.  That was a known thing back in the day.  Real life little romance budding from Joanie Loves Chachi.  And then, uh, and then I, I guess, uh, Scott Baio after that got glasses or contacts. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  And started, uh, banging all the hottest bras in Hollywood.  Oh, when he was doing that, uh, what show was he doing that, um, um, Charles in Charge.  That was a big show.  He was banging that, uh, girl from there that then went on to Baywatch.  Also Pam Anderson.  Yeah.  And, uh, who was the, uh, Playboy model?  Uh, Julie something?  Help me out, child.  Julie something.  It's in the article.  Oh, I don't know. 
[01:22:30]  Julie Child.  She's Julie Child.  She's, she's, uh, dead.  Is she?  I don't know.  She's 60 and naked holding a turkey over her head.  Uh, here it is.  Uh, playboy model, Julie McCullough dumps on him for cheating.  For cheating.  Yeah.  So she, uh, he was, uh, banging Julie McCullough.  Why would she reward him for cheating?  Uh, really dumps on him for cheating.  And she, uh, she writes in the review here.  I had my first AIDS test because of him. 
[01:23:00]  Jim?  Because of, uh, Scott Baio.  Oh, Jim Norton.  That's how much.  I got mine.  That's how much Scott Baio cheated on a Playboy model.  She actually had to get her first AIDS test.  Good for him.  And now he's 45 and single.  And, uh, VH1 is doing a little reality show with him.  And, uh, this is just, uh, terrific.  He has a life coach.  And he has a girlfriend, actually.  And, uh, obviously they're doing this for TV.  The life coach said, get rid of your girlfriend for eight weeks.  And let's, uh, let's, uh, do some dating. 
[01:23:30]  And let's go back and talk to some of your exes.  Why would a life coach, uh, suggest you throw your life in turmoil like that?  I don't know.  What's a life coach?  You're 45 and single and all you do is bang hot chicks.  Yeah.  As a life coach, you just go, continue.  Job well done.  When you're 75, maybe you want to stop this.  Yeah, then we'll talk.  Uh, here's Scott's life, uh, coach.  Three quick clips.  Who's the first person you ever had sex with?  Uh, a girl I did a TV show with.  Who?  Um, Erin Moran from Happy Days. 
[01:24:00]  She was your, your first?  Yes.  Joni did love Charger.  Right, right, right, right.  I haven't heard that.  I know, I know, I know.  Go ahead.  That's a hell of a start, Scott.  But he was not her first.  Tom Bosley was.  Little known.  That's right.  He covered her face with a glad bag.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yuck.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:24:30]  And then Mary and Ross came in holding an apple, uh, in an odd way.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  And said, where's Chuck?  And said, everyone yelled, we don't know.  He just disappeared.  Chuck just left.  There was a reason Chuck left.  There was an Amber Alert and Chuck hasn't been talked to in 17 years.  He's on the lam.  He did something bad because they didn't even acknowledge that he ever existed by season  two.  Amazing how they just didn't even acknowledge.  Got rid of Chuck.  He wasn't needed.  What did Chuck do?  Imagine that poor actor just going, shit, I'm on Happy Days.  I got a part on this new show, Happy Days. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  It's got Ron Howard in it.  Find out what happened to Chuck from Happy Days.  So they just never explain it.  Maybe like what he did in acting after that, uh, after that, uh.  Well, you hung out with Ron Howard.  Why didn't you ask him?  Yeah, you should have asked him, hey, what happened to Chuck?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  As he walks away, disgusted.  Next time I see him.  Yeah.  All right, uh, and now, uh, Scott asks Erin why they broke up.  Scott talking to Joni here.  Now, let me ask you a question.  Okay.  Did you do something to me or did I do something to you at any point? 
[01:25:30]  Okay.  Okay, the month and a half that we were together, you had said, I'm going to marry you.  We're going to get married.  How old were we?  14, 15.  No.  Yeah, sir.  I didn't say I'm going to marry you at 14.  For real?  Okay.  Oh, listen, you know what?  Women have better memory than me, so go ahead.  You've got a great memory.  I freaked out, and that's right after that I broke up with you.  Oh, because he was taking it a little seriously. 
[01:26:00]  Boy, these are the kind of things that people want to know about.  Yes.  Well, the next one is.  Was that Paul McCartney with his ukulele in the background?  Holding his lapels and puckering up?  Great lyrics.  His woman's lips.  That's just the setup.  This is the get right here.  I think you had another reason.  I'm pretty sure I know what it is.  I had another reason to what?  Um, that, uh, you would grow? 
[01:26:30]  Grow.  Oh, no.  My thing?  Yes.  Uh-huh.  Yes.  And you stressed it.  I'm not crazy.  You stressed.  You said, trust me, trust me, I'm going to grow.  It is not.  Okay.  When you're young, you're impressionable.  And when you have a small pee-pee.  I love you, pee.  And it starts growing.  Yeah. 
[01:27:00]  Wow.  So she just, uh, short-changed him there and said, uh.  He's got a small one.  Yeah.  Wow.  And he had a real problem with the fact that he had a small one.  Wow.  Well, right after that, she started dating Lionel from the Jefferson.  Yeah.  Oh, that's embarrassing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But that's been kind of a rumor around Hollywood.  Because he slept with so many women that, uh, the rumor is that he's, uh, not very well  endowed. 
[01:27:30]  So, uh, but, but he gets the girls, apparently.  Gets them at least once before they go, ha-ha, point and laugh Friday.  Point and laugh all the time at Scott Baio when he's, uh, when he's naked.  That sounds like a fascinating show.  Charles is in charge and he rolls with an iron pinky.  Dope.  Dope.  Why would you allow that on TV?  How desperate is it getting in Hollywood?  Pam Anderson slept with him.  Yeah.  And then Tommy Lee. 
[01:28:00]  Well.  It was after that.  Actually, officially, Pam Anderson never slept with him.  Oh, well, officially?  Wow.  What is it?  Alleged?  Yeah.  Unofficial?  Some, you know.  Was it Tommy Lee first or second?  I would say second, right?  You gotta be able.  I think Tommy Lee was second.  You gotta be able to touch the side to make it official.  Oof.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  It's not official unless you're touching the side.  Man, cause, uh, well, we all know Tommy Lee from the tape.  Oh, yeah.  There's no turning back after that.  That was probably a secret.  It was Bret Michaels and then Tommy Lee. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, so she stepped up.  Yeah.  She started out small and ended, uh.  Kind of stepped it up like, uh.  Impressively.  Yes, Jimmy.  Of course.  Very nice.  So you don't get stretch marks that way.  All right.  Well, that show's on, uh, VH1.  VH1.  Check that out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  DL Hughley's here?  Sure is.  DL Hughley joining the show next.  He's being, he's gonna be at Caroline's all weekend long.  I think, uh, tonight, uh, he's doing two shows.  Either two or three tomorrow, Saturday, and then Sunday. 
[01:29:00]  I think he's doing one or two shows.  I should probably have that in front of me.  He's gonna have a very busy weekend at Caroline's.  Yeah, he sells out everywhere.  We'll talk to him next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, that's right.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  In studio, DL Hughley.  What's up, man?  We, uh, we met DL down in Washington.  He was, you were taping your HBO special the same, well, the day before, I guess, or something  like that.  Night after the end.  Mattel, and then myself, then DL. 
[01:29:30]  You know, always the brother laughs.  What type of stuff is that?  Give him the Sunday?  Give him the Sunday.  Sunday.  Brothers like Sundays, don't they?  Yeah, it was cool, man.  I had a really good time.  And DL walks into the studio.  I'm like, oh, man, we played your appearance on Leno again.  He's like, oh, enough of that.  No, you know what it is.  I don't, and I was just joking.  I think people just need to light it.  Joke's a joke.  Well, you know what it is.  You don't have to tell us.  You can get suspended for actually having an opinion that's different than everybody 
[01:30:00]  else.  And they send you to the shop like you, the defective robot.  This is the bad robot.  He actually thinks differently than everybody else.  You have to be fixed.  Take the blue pill.  Go back to the Matrix.  That's a great way to look at it.  Man, and you just, you know, and I don't even understand.  How do you get fired?  I mean, suspended from a show where people hate or pay to hear the stuff y'all do.  That's what we said.  Yeah, we got suspended for 30 days.  Right.  Yeah.  I mean, what happened to I'm is almost happened to us. 
[01:30:30]  And all we're trying to do is entertain people.  Right.  And then you got to do it the way.  And then you don't even get a chance to explain what happened that day because all of a sudden  they're running with like a 10 second clip from the bid on CNN.  Lawyers jump in.  You know what?  Don't tell me.  I mean, I'm telling you literally, I've been boycotted and picketed.  Yeah.  Didn't they protest you in Dallas or something?  In Dallas, man.  But it was just like the weakest.  It's three dudes.  But three dudes can have a lot of power.  That's what we argue all the time.  It's like tell these special interest groups to shut up and we're going to run our own company 
[01:31:00]  the way we want to.  But you know what?  The thing about it, they can do that when you run.  Like you literally work for a corporation.  So you're a corporate.  Shields.  I mean, no disrespect.  Hey, not at all.  I'm taking.  That's not true.  I got sponsored by Bud Light.  Brought to you by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  When you boycotted comedian, I'm like, I don't work for nobody.  I just sell more tickets.  What are you doing?  Independent contractor.  You can say whatever the hell you want.  Who's going to protest you?  I'm not going to fire me.  Yeah.  I'm the last one. 
[01:31:30]  I've decided to fire myself.  You got to call a big press conference, get the podium, all the microphones.  I've decided I am irresponsible.  I am firing myself.  I've had enough of my unintelligent comments and I'm going to.  I'm going to.  Effective immediately.  How great would it be if you got in front of a bunch of press and started a boycott on  yourself?  Right.  I'm going to announce a boycott on me.  Hey, man.  It'd be fantastic.  I'm going to do it.  Do it.  And you know what?  I promise.  I'm serious.  Hey, hey, hey, Red. 
[01:32:00]  That's what I'm going to boycott myself.  Just boycott yourself.  Yeah, that'd be hilarious.  I'm going to do it.  And they would be sitting there like, well, we got to run this on the news.  It's DL Hughley.  I'm going to join the people that are boycotting.  I'm going to boycott myself.  I got to hurry up because I got a show to do.  I boycott myself in between shows.  In between shows.  I'm going to call the news and see if they'll watch me boycott.  Yeah, yeah.  Now, I got to ask you.  That's hilarious.  They will.  That's the first bit I'm going to do.  Oh, the news will, too.  They're vultures.  Now, on radio, we already know we're not safe.  Like, we're going to say something stupid, and we're just going to try to entertain somebody, 
[01:32:30]  and we're going to get in trouble again.  How does a grown man get in trouble?  But if you're a cartoon, or if you're doing the same type of material on a TV show, or on  a movie, it's fine.  But radio, for some reason, we're the scums of society.  It's not just radio.  Music is...  Wow, the music, the rap thing is still going to be easy to go after.  It really is not.  And now that...  You know what?  I honestly, and I really respect anybody's right to disagree. 
[01:33:00]  I think it's arrogant to go, I don't like something, so I believe nobody should have  the right to see it.  That's what I...  And that's just really...  I don't...  And people are always...  You're apologizing for Don Hymans.  Damn, Don, I don't even...  I don't know him.  I never met him.  I'm arguing for his right to say what he wants to say.  That's all I'm saying.  Because I am going to then say what I want to say.  That's right.  You have the best quote, too, about...  That's right.  They wanted you to apologize in Dallas.  It was, I'm not going to apologize for making jokes about life as I see it.  Right. 
[01:33:30]  And it's amazing, as comics, how they expect you to apologize, or you have to justify  why you're laughing at something somebody said.  It's disgusting.  I don't know the Dallas situation.  What happened?  These ministers...  Can you say it, or...?  Yeah, oh yeah.  These ministers.  And it's always...  And this was something you did in a comedy club?  Well, no, it was Jay Leno.  Okay.  Right?  They took the clip from Jay Leno, and they were upset that I made the joke.  Oh, okay.  It had something to do with that.  And then they didn't want...  I was playing a performing arts center, and they didn't want me to play the performing  arts center, so they called, just like Caroline's got a call, and the guy asked them to pull 
[01:34:00]  a show.  No.  Just because of what you said on Leno.  Yeah, but three months ago, what are they getting this on?  Telekite?  Pony Express delivering this?  Special delivery message.  Then they said, you know, he called them...  First off, I never call them hoes, but now they want to ban the word ho.  And I'll stop saying ho when I start seeing them.  I know if you're hoes.  I really do.  And I love hoes.  I'm hoping to meet three or four tonight. 
[01:34:30]  Just because you stopped saying hoes, they're going to stop...  They're going to disappear.  I mean, if five dudes claim to be your baby daddy at the same time, you're a hoes.  Let's move on.  What is that all about?  You got to be politically correct.  They're not hoes.  They're girls who know the value of a dollar.  Right.  I don't understand it, man.  I don't...  Oh, man.  So it was very refreshing.  He said, I ain't apologizing.  Right.  But it was a very eloquent way to put it because it was without anger.  You know, I tend to react too angrily and I lose my point.  But that was a perfect way to put it. 
[01:35:00]  And the way you explained it on Leno was a perfect way to put it about, look, this is  the reality and this is what I want to say.  Well, you know what it is?  When people that are different...  Like, I've said whatever.  I've said I've been consistent from the beginning.  If you watch me 20...  10 years ago, I have the same point.  John Rocker said something 10, 15 years ago on Kings of Comedy.  I said he had the right to say it.  This ain't new for me.  I'm not a new guy who just all of a sudden...  I've always felt like when Michael Richards said what he said, I didn't like it. 
[01:35:30]  He had the right to say it.  I know what I...  If you call me...  If I say that word, if you call me a nigga and I know I ain't one, then why am I going...  How do you call somebody a hoe in Chicago and a woman in Florida get mad?  That's what I...  What is it?  Is it a hoe hotline?  What is it?  I mean...  They're all connected.  You know that.  I don't understand.  And I get that.  They're all sisters.  They're all sisters, man.  They're sticking up for each other no matter what. 
[01:36:00]  I get that some of the things that people say, but I am a nightclub act.  That's right.  People come out at night with drinks and nachos to hear me say some of the most vile shit you could say.  Right, right.  That's what they pay me for.  Right.  And I'm supposed to pretend like I don't say that?  What committee on decency?  Like, even if you tell me about Don Iams, how does taking the show off the air that we didn't even know was on help us?  Yeah, I really don't think that...  I don't think any of the Rutgers team was listening to Don Iams.  They probably wouldn't have known about any of that if people that told them, hey, look, you better be affected by this. 
[01:36:30]  And here's my thing.  Anybody has the right to argue about my point.  Anybody has the right to say, I don't like that.  And you have the power to come see me or not see me.  But if I got a microphone, I'm going to say what the fuck I believe, not what you want me to believe.  That's it.  Why not?  I'm not going to let some dude that I don't even know tell me what I believe is decent.  You don't know my experiences.  I'd love to have Bill Cosby's career or Sinbad's career.  I just don't see the world the way they do it.  Bill Cosby more than Sinbad. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, but I'm sure it's not Bill Cosby.  Sinbad up until 95.  But it's just like I don't get it.  And then you do stuff that I don't understand.  Like even if, you know, and I said this bit on my HBO special.  I don't understand.  We have real problems in our community.  And if you're going to be a civil rights activist, you have to address the stuff that really goes on.  One in three black people in this country can't read.  Ninety-three percent of black people in this country are killed by other black people. 
[01:37:30]  There are more black men in jail than in college.  You don't worry about what I'm saying, but I guess that makes sense because apparently that was the one white man that was holding us back.  Yeah.  Right, right, right.  Now that he's gone.  Yeah.  Jubilee.  All those problems are going to be solved.  It's easy, though.  That's the easy stuff to go after.  It's the easy target and stuff.  And I don't know why.  It just annoys the crap out of me that you can't get a black leader that addresses those issues seriously and gets to the point publicly where they're like up there and as well known as Al Sharpton is. 
[01:38:00]  Well, here's the thing.  I don't want to lead anybody.  I don't want to change anybody's life.  I'm going to just keep doing what I do.  Like, I don't think what I do is important.  I don't think what I do matters.  I don't care.  You know, I'm not, you know, like I'm not standing on a podium saying like they have a tendency to kind of say since I said it, it's reflective of a view I have of the whole.  No, man.  I got it.  Here's the thing.  I came from a nappy head mama and I'm a nappy head daddy and I got nappy head kids. 
[01:38:30]  I can't make a comment.  Yeah, you're not allowed.  I can't weigh in on this issue.  It's just to me.  But if I now I will I will sit and say the same thing on Tom Jordan show.  I'll sit and say it on, you know, BET.  I got a show on BET.  But if I sit in front of white dudes, if I say they have the exact same conversation in front of white dudes.  Yeah.  Then I'm saying something crazy.  I'm going to be whoever I am.  I said what I said on Jay Leno.  I said it on BET.  I'll say it on HBO.  It don't make me a difference where I said I'm going to be who I am regardless of who's around me. 
[01:39:00]  It seems like a lot of times that black guys, if you disagree a certain way, there's a whole other racial angle from other black people.  Like white guys or white people, if we say something, conservatives will come after us or liberals will come after us.  But it's almost like with black guys, you have the other angle of, hey, you're kind of disagreeing publicly.  You're saying something publicly in front of white people.  Well, I don't get the memo.  You know what?  All I can say is this.  I don't get the memo.  They didn't give me the memo.  I never get the email that says what the part. 
[01:39:30]  Like I watch people get offended when Barack Obama got called articulate.  You can't call them, you can't say the N word, you can't say articulate, you can't say nothing.  White people are going, what can we call these people?  It'll make them happy.  Some newscasts are like, he is very well spoken.  It's like, well, what does that mean?  Yeah.  What are you getting at with that comment?  We're losing our minds in the country.  And you know what it is.  I literally, I was doing a show and this Asian dude, I said Oriental and he hopped up and said, 
[01:40:00]  I'm not Oriental.  I said, man, how do I know?  Right.  All I know is y'all all run from Godzilla the same way.  That's all the hell I know.  I don't know.  Orientals is stuff.  Right, right.  Yeah, that's from, and for years it was Oriental, Oriental, Oriental guy.  And then it changed and went from, no, Oriental is a thing.  Right.  It's like an Oriental rug or something like that.  Right.  We are Asian.  I didn't get a memo.  And you're like, I, I, I, I didn't know.  No one told me, right.  No memo came in. 
[01:40:30]  I didn't get that.  But I thought you guys were supposed to be on subscription radio.  We, yeah.  Well, that's, uh, yeah.  Well, that's on nine o'clock.  That's nine o'clock.  You curse only one.  We're still on regular FM radio.  We're on both right now.  That's all right.  We're on regular till nine.  And then we're on also on.  Super unleaded.  Yeah.  Oh, then, then it becomes, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I got to stay till nine, damn it.  I got to get on it.  Oh, yeah.  Believe me.  This is like the white death jam.  I'm into this.  Yeah.  Once, once nine hits, all bets are off.  But it, it got, it got to the point because, uh, you know, we work for, like you said, 
[01:41:00]  a corporation that you have to adhere to their rules.  And, and it really isn't a freedom of speech issue because it's a freedom of whatever the  hell the corporate ties want you to say or not say based on advertisers and stuff like  that.  But you, you have a mic, you get up on stage.  Why the hell can't you say whatever you want?  Ever.  You know, here's the thing.  And ultimately, it is the public that will decide.  Yeah.  They'll tolerate from it.  Yep.  Right?  It'll be the public.  But people, uh, and Jim, you, you, you've seen me. 
[01:41:30]  I talk about every single issue.  I'm, I'm, I'm like, I talk about social, I talk about as many social issues as any comic  I know.  Mm-hmm.  Like war, peace, uh, well, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the sim cell.  I mean, I'll talk about anything.  So they'll take one small thing that I said.  Well, there you go.  And that will indict the whole thing.  And I, and I'm just saying this, I really personally don't believe, I believe freedom  of speech is kind of a zero sum proposition.  I believe if I'm going to be able to say something, I can then not, I'd be hypocritical if I denied  anybody else the right to say it. 
[01:42:00]  Like that, that's all.  There's common sense in when you say things and when you don't say things, there's basic  common sense that will keep you from getting your ass beat.  Right.  That's for sure.  But I mean, uh, especially in comedy, comedy, cause comedy, there should be no limit.  None.  If you can make, if you could make fun and make people laugh out of some heinous crap,  you should be able to do it.  That's a talent.  Right.  That is a genuine talent.  If people aren't laughing, like you said, the public will decide and go, you know, I saw 
[01:42:30]  that guy.  He's just an ass.  He's not funny.  You're not going to go back to see him next time he's in town.  Or maybe some people see him.  Some people want, but comedy is then put under this microscope for some reason of late where  even that is being treated.  Like I said, like national public radio, like this show is being treated with the same rules  as NPR is now.  So if some guy on NPR gets up there and starts talking about people, yeah, four people listening  and using the N word or whichever one you want to choose from now, there's a few N words 
[01:43:00]  we're not allowed to use.  Uh, then we're going to get in trouble.  But comedy, I just don't like to hear grown people, grown men saying they're going to  get in trouble, in trouble.  You're right.  Like, I'm not a kid.  How's my father going to come down there and take the keys away?  But I'm going to get a whooping or something.  Remember when you were a kid and getting older meant you weren't going to get in trouble  anymore.  That's what you get grown for.  Right.  That's what you grew up for.  That's what you took those beatings on your ass from your father. 
[01:43:30]  It was so you could grow up and not get beat anymore and get in trouble.  I, I, I, I, you know, and, and I, here's my whole thing.  It's just a matter of common sense.  You know, now in New York, they want to pass a bill that says you can't say the N word.  Right.  Which, okay.  Well, they buried it in Detroit.  But if you, but, but if you took a list of the problems that I, that, that are in our  communities, the N word would be about 350.  Oh.  How about this?  Now, the N word, I don't know personally ever killed anybody, but pork chops, pork chops 
[01:44:00]  and not exercise in Duke.  Yes.  You know what I'm saying?  They do.  That's going to creep up on you eventually.  You eat enough pork and sister.  And you know, that, that, that's the deal.  What, what, what tends to happen is that you can't say, Hey, you know what?  We're overweight.  Hey, we don't do this.  We don't do that.  Then you're wrong.  Sure.  But you can say, make a symbolic gesture, like killing the N word.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, and, and the same day that you were symbolically burying the N word, probably four brothers  in Detroit really got buried because of violence. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  That's so, it's, it's just dumb to me.  And I, I don't pretend to know anything like that.  We were amazed that the mayor of Detroit went with that whole bit, like actually burying  the N word in a pine box at a funeral.  You know something?  Yeah.  It's kind of hard for the mayor to not show up though.  The mayor kind of has to show up for that.  The mayor can't go, Oh, that's silly.  It's right.  Keep it alive.  We ain't talking about Vermont.  How about, how about you show up for that?  But it was just so silly to us.  How about you show up at other funerals, a gang related killing funerals and speak out 
[01:45:00]  against that a little, that's a little more, uh, something to grab onto than this symbolic  thing.  But that's real.  You can't have, we don't really want, but just like in this, like it, that is symptom of  a symptomatic of the whole country.  We don't really want to do anything.  We just want to give symbolic gestures.  Like after nine 11, remember they had the national guards standing around.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They didn't want to change anything.  They just want people to think that they feel better about it.  And that's just it.  So our job is as a, as a comedian and I just, you want to keep pounding this ad nauseum. 
[01:45:30]  I'm not trying to change people's perceptions.  I'm not trying to get a rallying group together.  I'm not trying to get people to follow me.  I don't want to change the world.  I want to laugh at it.  Yeah.  I want it to stay just as, as vile and sick as it is, or I won't have any material.  Exactly.  We're losing the battle though.  Something's got to change.  Yep.  You're right.  If everything is great and everybody's getting along and there's racial harmony, you're on  stage, you're going to go, hello.  Right.  Everyone's out having fun. 
[01:46:00]  Life sucks when everything is great.  They wouldn't even be at the comedy clubs.  They'd be enjoying their lives.  Right.  Not just sitting there drinking like fish saying, please someone else make me laugh.  Everyone I know can't do it.  And Jim will tell you, the more, the harder stuff gets, the more depressed people are,  the meaner the world gets, the better comedy does.  Absolutely.  And again, as long as you're not trying to change people's lives, it's like, no, we're  not that arrogant.  We just want to make you laugh at it.  Right.  I'm not pompous enough to think that I have a tremendous influence.  Some of the best comics came out at some of the worst times, man. 
[01:46:30]  Look at the 60s, Vietnam, all the, uh, talk about Vietnam.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what people don't understand.  Right.  Right.  This is our time.  And I say that all the time.  This is our kind of, there haven't been this kind of political and social upheaval since  the 60s and a division of, of the country.  Like people are so divided on party lines and, and as far as the war goes.  So it, there is this turmoil going on that comedians feed off of, but people are seeing  it as this political incorrectness that needs to be thrown under a carpet somewhere. 
[01:47:00]  Right.  No, I'm your, I'm your illegitimate child.  You don't want to.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Please go.  Don't, here's a couple of bucks.  Get out of here.  Don't ever call me daddy.  Yeah.  But it's just, and I think that it is comedians.  And I say this all the time.  I like mirrors and generally mirrors show you a lot of things you don't want to see.  And, and, and that is what we're reflective of.  I didn't come from a foreign planet.  I'm from this earth.  I'm, I ain't from a vacuum. 
[01:47:30]  I've seen the same things you have.  I've watched the same things you do, but I have a different experience.  If I had the same kind of take that you did, I'd be the banker that's driving to work wanting  to kill itself right now.  Yeah.  I'd be the guy who's going through a job.  He, I love my job because I get the art is somebody said this to me.  Michael Dyson said this to me and he said that art, and I consider comedy the highest  form of art, um, makes you uncomfortable.  It makes you, it's non-conforming.  You're not supposed to sit down and go, wow, that really soothes me.  If you want to be sued, get some fish. 
[01:48:00]  I'm not.  Yeah.  I'm here to, I'm here to tell you, like, I'm not here to get a cat, a parakeet.  I'm not that.  You want people questioning themselves.  Like, I can't believe I'm laughing at this.  What is wrong with me?  He's absolutely right about the uncomfortable thing and stuff.  Like there, there have been movies I've watched.  Good movies.  You sit there, watch them.  They're done.  You just don't even think about them again.  If there's a movie that like all of a sudden the credits start rolling and you're like,  they better not start rolling the credits.  What the hell?  You're not finished.  This movie isn't done yet.  And it gets you so pissed. 
[01:48:30]  Like, I'm sitting there with my chick discussing it an hour later going, what happened with  this?  Why did they do this?  Because it's different than everything else.  It left you feeling like you needed something more.  It made you uncomfortable.  It was, I was pissed when I was done.  Sometimes that, it makes you more alive.  It makes you discuss more.  It makes you feel like you're, you're in it.  People never really seem to get this, but the simplest things to be different.  All you got to be is who you are to be different.  All you got to do is be, all I'm trying to do honestly is be who I am. 
[01:49:00]  I don't want to ask for permission.  I refuse to ask for permission to be what I'm supposed to do.  Well, this might be funny.  Should I, I should pass it by the decency committee to see if they're going to approve this.  And I hope they get back to me.  You're hurting us.  Cause I got to show it seven o'clock.  You're hurting us because we have that committee.  It's called corporate lawyers.  Lawyers.  Funny people never make the determinations.  It's never, it's not like people who run comedy or who are in charge of it are funny.  Right.  They're nerds.  They've never been funny in their lives. 
[01:49:30]  So they're making determinations on what's a problem.  We don't walk into the lawyer's office and he sits there with squeezes something and  his tie pops up and he's just having a blast.  He squirts us with a carnation and tells us we can do any bit we want.  It never happens.  Those lawyers are nothing but granite.  They're just cadavers.  Body spoke.  They're dead.  Shake her hands.  A little party zapper.  Wouldn't that be funny?  Ha ha.  Sit down.  Wookiee cushion.  You know what makes us the most uncomfortable is sex. 
[01:50:00]  Sex.  Race.  Like sex.  You always see some right wing Republican who was like he's some right wing nut job who  was pro family and against this and you'll find out he's screwing hookers.  Oh yeah.  Or maybe something's on his computer and yeah.  Right.  Right.  Mark Foley that Republican that naughty boy that Mark Foley was.  You're a naughty boy.  David Bitter.  Bill O'Reilly and his trouble that we all.  Right.  Yeah.  Bill O'Reilly swept that under the carpet with a little settlement.  And now he's wearing a wedding ring.  You see that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well he's a family guy. 
[01:50:30]  Come on.  Give me a break.  It's hypocrisy man.  And his sister used to come to the office with a little league chest protector on it.  I don't understand him.  But so you know and I'm not the greatest thing about what I get to do is I don't I don't  ever take myself seriously.  I don't ever believe that that that what I'm saying is important and I never like I  never believe I'm as good as I think I am or I never believe I'm as bad as they say  I am.  I believe that that if you don't like what I'm saying you won't come see me. 
[01:51:00]  Right.  If you do you will and I'm not going to kiss your ass either way.  If you don't fuck.  I mean I'm sorry but that was for the eight o'clock.  Yeah.  Right.  By the way.  I don't want that.  That actually got the $200,000.  It got through on XM.  Do you have to get out of here?  No man.  I'm staying.  Oh someone said you have to leave at 825.  I don't work for nobody.  I'm not kidding.  I got to know.  It's him.  He's the guy.  He all has to leave at 830.  I have to protest me.  Yeah.  He's protesting.  He's got to pick it.  I got to.  I know. 
[01:51:30]  That was your that was your out.  Just in case it wasn't going well.  Look guys.  I got to be out at 830.  Wait.  Does he have more press?  No.  He's right here.  I know.  He's the guy.  I'm saying I got to talk to me.  Hang on.  Yeah.  He's going to have a meeting with himself.  Greg's just creepy.  He just brings people around.  Hey Jim.  So I want y'all to get somebody to come cover me.  Protest myself.  That would be hilarious.  You know what would be funny is if you had like a wig on and nobody recognized you and  you were out doing the thing.  And they question you.  All right.  We got to take a quick break. 
[01:52:00]  Why are you marching in?  He doesn't have to leave.  Why?  You really have to leave?  Says who?  He doesn't even know this.  DL doesn't want to leave.  I'm not leaving.  Says Greg.  Wait.  Well get Greg in here.  Greg.  Let's get to the bottom of this.  This is what we do with our show.  Obviously.  D-Rock.  What do you know?  Maybe something else lost.  You know more than DL Bugle himself.  What does D-Rock know?  What?  All right.  This will be a tidy two seconds.  Greg Charles told us that he had to leave at 8.30.  Hey man.  Look at that.  Look at this.  Always somebody telling somebody what to do.  He's got to.  It's got to happen. 
[01:52:30]  Why?  He's got to go.  I don't know because it has to.  But nobody can ever tell you why anything has to happen.  No, no.  It just has to.  I'm thinking you have to be on TV or something.  I'm thinking TV for, yeah.  Now let's watch it funny if he comes in.  Well DL has Good Morning America in 15 minutes.  You know what?  That was a good point.  Should be out of here.  Yeah.  Should be gone.  Here comes Greg Charles.  Greg Charles.  All right.  Why does DL have to leave?  You're not the corporate steal.  Yeah.  We saw him in a suit the other day.  He's like, I had to go to a meeting.  I did.  I got dragged.  First of all, nothing says I didn't shower like a collared shirt and a baseball hat. 
[01:53:00]  Why does he have to leave?  We actually had him scheduled to do something else down the block.  What?  Hot 97.  Oh.  Oh, you said it on the air, too.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Well, if you want to hear DL and a little more of DL, tune over to Hot 97.  See, we'll even plug your appearance on Hot 97.  Sorry.  Now look at DL.  Well, in fairness, we did ask.  Craig doesn't know.  He's a sweet boy.  Right.  We did ask him, and he didn't want to come in and lie. 
[01:53:30]  Right.  Yeah, I would never lie.  I mean, granted, that was a debacle what you just did.  I wanted to be honest.  And it does take a little while to put your Kevlar on before you head over.  How about this?  We're going to break.  DL might be here when we get back.  He might not.  Let's see.  If we can talk to the man.  Right, right.  He's definitely playing Carolines all weekend long.  I can't wait to see it, DL.  I'm going to be there.  212-757-4100.  Yes, sir.  And it's tonight, two shows.  Tomorrow, Saturday, there's three shows.  And Sunday, 8 o'clock, there's one show. 
[01:54:00]  Obviously, DL's a theater act, so these will all sell out.  Because you usually don't do clubs.  You usually do theaters.  But I love Carolines, and I can't wait.  Right on.  I'm coming to picket me, so.  All right, cool.  DL, real quick, also promoting on BET, SOB, Socially Offensive Behavior.  It premieres a week from Wednesday on July 25th at 10 o'clock p.m.  And it's Wednesday nights after that.  Thanks, man.  I love the way you look at comedy and the way you look at yourself.  Absolutely.  It's great.  I don't get BET.  Why?  The ghost of my father comes in and shuts it off. 
[01:54:30]  What the hell are you doing?  What kind of music is that?  Knock that off.  And did we, say, watch him on HBO in September?  Yes, September 29th.  I heard his special was unbelievable.  Hopefully, we will be able to talk to him before.  Yeah, come on back.  Because I know you're leaving us.  No.  I'm going to stay.  It'll be a nice surprise if you're here after the break.  All right, we'll see.  DL Hughley, everyone, at Caroline.  Let's see if he believes what he's saying.  Let's see.  Let's see who wins.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  Tracy, the new PD here in New York, came in and got everyone arguing about health care 
[01:55:00]  in America.  Well, I was supposed to speak to Michael Moore.  Yeah.  Later on.  We have some audio of him on Larry King, I guess that was.  So we were just talking about socialized medicine.  Wolf Blitzer, actually.  Oh, it's Wolf?  Yeah.  Oh, is it the situation rule?  The situation room.  Oh, my God.  We've got a situation.  Whoop, whoop, whoop.  I just want to say how great DL is, man.  Yeah.  Goddamn guy just gets in here and speaks his mind.  He was awesome.  That's, you know, it's refreshing to see, really is. 
[01:55:30]  And it should be as simple as what he's saying.  Yeah.  It's very simple.  But unfortunately, it has to be over the top complicated.  What he says about comics is true.  It's like, no, you're not changing people's lives.  That's what's so annoying about, like, entertainers that take themselves so seriously and get on  the news.  Shut your face.  Yeah.  Either speak through your art or shut your mouth.  Yep.  We're not changing people's lives.  You know, the radio guys, you know, you guys have a responsibility.  No.  No, we don't.  We're jugglers. 
[01:56:00]  We're jugglers.  We're just as important as jugglers.  We're plate spinners.  We're entertaining people who are trying to.  I don't allow Imus or anybody to influence the way I live my life.  No.  So why would anyone allow me to influence the way they live their lives?  If they do, they're stupid.  That's it.  And if I have that much influence, how about this?  If you're female and you're attractive, when I walk by, kneel and open.  There you go.  Look at that.  Not as much influence as they thought.  Well, we got Bye Bye Plane.  We got the Michael Moore audio from Wolf Blitzer. 
[01:56:30]  I'd like to hear the Michael Moore audio.  Do you want to go there?  Let me hear that.  I think Michael Moore is calling in a little later this morning.  Yeah, 10.30.  10.30 today on the opening of the show.  Okay.  Here he is on Wolf Blitzer.  Michael, thanks very much for coming in.  You want to respond to anything we just heard?  Yeah, I'd like about 10 minutes to respond to what was said.  Give us a couple headlines.  What would you like to say?  I don't talk in sound bites. 
[01:57:00]  You know what?  Because I know you're not a fan of Michael Moore,  and that's fine in general.  No, no, I actually met Michael Moore,  and we spoke.  We liked him.  And I like the guy as a guy.  Yeah.  As a guy, I like him,  and I like how he handles the press a lot of times.  With that, I'm not going to speak in sound bites stuff.  He just said something so important there  that has killed us personally.  It's killed many people out there.  CNN, Fox News Channel, all of them.  It's a big thing to say.  They speak in sound bites.  Could you give us just one thing? 
[01:57:30]  You've got 10 seconds to wrap up what you really need 10 minutes to say.  And that Paula Zahn.  She stinks.  She stinks.  Because this is the same network, CNN.  Yeah.  And that's what they did to us.  They spoke in sound bites and didn't get the whole story out there  with what happened to us.  You know, tough to defend, I understand.  But trust me, if they had all the facts out there  when we were going through our latest controversy,  it would have been a lot different.  But they spoke in sound bites  because that's the glamorous thing to do. 
[01:58:00]  You know, they know people don't want to pay too much attention.  Short attention spans.  And all that.  So Michael Moore said something really important right there.  That's why he said, I need 10 minutes,  but I'm not going to speak in sound bites like you guys do.  Yes, sir.  I don't talk in sound bites.  So that report was so biased.  I can't imagine what pharmaceutical company ads coming up  right after our break here.  But, you know, why don't you tell the truth to the American people?  I mean, I wish that CNN and the other mainstream media  would just for once tell the truth about what's going on in this country, 
[01:58:30]  whether it's with health care.  I don't care what it is.  I mean, you guys have such a poor track record.  And for me to come on here and have to listen to that kind of crap,  I mean, seriously.  See, I don't know what they played just before.  Yeah, what was before that?  That really pissed them off.  Was it a negative review on his movie?  Were they skewing the facts?  What happened?  Do we know?  It was probably some kind of a little answer  to one of his situations in his movie. 
[01:59:00]  I would assume it's something like,  hey, you showed this in your movie, but we found this.  Steve, do we know what that is?  I have no idea what you're speaking of.  Does anyone know?  Who cut this up?  We need a little more info on this.  Anybody?  All right, all right.  Sam.  Let's play the next clip.  It goes on.  This gets really good.  I haven't been on your show now for three years.  The last time I was on, you ran a similar piece about Fahrenheit 9-11 saying,  oh, this can't be true, what he's saying about the war,  how it's going to be a quagmire, the weapons of mass destruction. 
[01:59:30]  Why don't you start off, actually, with my first appearance back here on your show in three years  and maybe apologize to me for saying that three years ago  because it turned out everything I said in Fahrenheit was true.  Everything's come to happen.  Everything I said, I mean, I took you in that film to Walter Reed Hospital.  It took three years before you or any of the rest of the mainstream media would go to Walter Reed Hospital  and see what was happening to our troops. 
[02:00:00]  And CNN and the rest of them, they don't take any responsibility.  They did a really good job trying to destroy our careers, and then they just move on to the next thing,  the next story, the next fluff piece.  He's making some good points here.  He's murdering.  He really is making some good points.  Oh, boy, do we have a situation, don't we, Wolf?  Yes.  You're in the middle of a situation you can't handle.  Wolf.  That's probably his screen name. 
[02:00:30]  Wolf, older gentleman.  Why don't you sit down, Wolf?  Sam, what happened for that?  Well, basically, before he came on, they aired a little video package about the movie  and said what it was about.  And then they said some of his numbers were inaccurate, and they posted what their findings were.  And it was just one or two facts that he had said that they said were off.  And they said, you know, at the end of it, that they said positive things about the movie,  but they said that some of his facts were fudged. 
[02:01:00]  Can we have the facts that were supposedly fudged because we got him at 1030,  so you can ask him for his response on that?  Yeah.  Yep.  What did you have for breakfast today?  I know we usually ask what you have for dinner, but what the hell?  Well, this morning I...  Well, hold on.  I mean, Iraq over there, about as prepared as a boy can be.  I'd like to know what the...  You know, sucking down fruit punch.  Well.  Is he sighing heavily?  Of course he is. 
[02:01:30]  This morning I had...  Aw, what did you have for breakfast?  Um, well, I had a hamburger roll with butter on it on the drive-in, and then I had a soda  called Werner's, which is from Detroit.  Werner's soda?  Yeah, it's really good.  It's a ginger-based soda.  Like ginger ale, but a little stronger.  Oh, wow. 
[02:02:00]  It tastes really good.  Uh, they don't have it here, but my parents were luckily in Detroit over the weekend.  Blah, blah, blah.  His parents sent him a soda.  So they got me a couple cases of Werner's, which...  You like.  And that was it?  Yeah, that was it.  Hamburger roll with butter on it?  With butter on it.  And Werner's.  And some soda no one has heard of, except for the people that are listening to us in Detroit.  Right.  All right, Sam, thanks.  And, uh, that's...  What else did you have in 1930 when that audio was captured?  Like an updated version of that.  Well, you know, by tomorrow we'll have something nice.  Well, I'm putting my foot down. 
[02:02:30]  All right, very good.  Uh, Michael Moore continues.  You're the ones who are fudging the facts.  You fudged the facts to the American people now for I don't know how long about this issue,  about the war, and I'm just curious, when are you going to just stand there and apologize  to the American people for not bringing the truth to them that isn't sponsored by some  major corporation?  I mean, I'll sit here for as long as it takes if you can do that for me.  Wow.  Well, that's a good point also, because we brought up the fact that, uh, the news is  a sponsored, uh, show, um, and, and until they're not a sponsored show, you're going 
[02:03:00]  to get some type of bias, conflicts of interest, uh, and, and such.  And, uh, that's, that's kind of the point he's bringing up where, you know, a pharmaceutical  ad comes on, uh, where there's one on right now, as I look at the news that we're watching  on TV, there's a pharmaceutical ad on, um, and, uh, uh, from what, uh, Michael Moore is  saying, you know, these pharmaceuticals, uh, are making huge amounts of money, um, charging 
[02:03:30]  huge amounts of money for the medicine, which really doesn't cost that much, uh, and that's  where the crime is.  I, I don't think we would need, um, socialized medicine if, uh, people would just be able  to get the insurance companies and the pharmaceutical companies in line, because that's where the  big problem is.  I, I, the insurance companies, if they're having to pay thousands of dollars for prescriptions,  they're going to jack their prices up and not accept certain people and, and, and whatnot. 
[02:04:00]  And then everybody blames the lawyers.  Well, it's because the lawyers sue and it's a giant, it's a, it's a cyclical thing that  nobody would actually ever be blamed for totally because it's, it's a group effort, but that  implies that if the lawyers weren't suing, the doctors in the medical industry and the  insurance companies out of the goodness of their hearts would provide and they're scum  and they're money based and they wouldn't, the doctors aren't scum, but the insurance companies  are, and they would not provide regardless of being sued. 
[02:04:30]  They would always try to squeeze you regardless of what's good for you to make more money.  It's the reality.  Yeah, it is a cyclical thing.  It's, uh, you know, the, the doctors, uh, lawyers, insurance companies, uh, each one can  pin the blame on the other.  So nobody really has to take the blame.  And the, do you know, uh, pharmaceutical companies, uh, do all kinds of favors and, uh, for doctors  like these pharmaceutical salespeople visit doctors and, um, sign them up. 
[02:05:00]  And in order to do that, they do certain favors for them.  And, um, they're, uh, I'm not saying there's money, uh, bounce back and forth, but perhaps  that's it going on, uh, trips, things like that.  So that when you go into the doctor's office and you say you have a certain problem, he's  more apt to prescribe you the medicine that got him the best favor, uh, that shouldn't  be happening.  Things like that.  You know, you're not getting the best care.  You're getting the best care.  The doctor wants to give you also in his best interest. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  I can't wait to see sicko.  It's really good, dude.  I'm kind of bummed.  I didn't get to see it before.  Uh, we talked to Michael Moore, but I've, uh, I've again, historically I've, I've a time.  I like Michael Moore's filmmaking, even though I know that at times I, I would love to ask  him about Roger me when he calls in too, cause there was rumors that that a lot of that was  fudged, but I, I really liked this a lot.  Yeah.  All right, cool.  Let's, uh, play another clip here.  Uh, I think we'll finally tries to defend himself.  In fairness, we had a lot of commercials for sicko that we've been running on CNN as well.  So, uh, so, you know, we, we, we have commercials. 
[02:06:00]  This is a, this is a business obviously, but let's talk a little bit about one of the nightly,  you have a nightly medical report.  You have something called the daily dose.  So I watched CNN, you have it every day, the daily dose sponsored by fill in the blank  and you are, you are funded by these people day in and day out.  Don't even compare that to my movie being out for a couple of weeks.  I would say that ads for 15 seconds.  I don't know if you're familiar with, I don't know if you're, I love it.  Oh, he's spanking him pretty bad. 
[02:06:30]  The stupid wolf thinks he's too cool for everybody else.  Too cool for the room.  You know, wolf is a nerd.  He really is a nerd.  Blitzer.  His dumb situation room.  Oh, we got a situation.  Do we?  And then you tune in and he's talking about the three H's cause it's really hot on the  East coast.  Wow.  That's a situation.  All right.  Something that's been happening since the beginning of time.  That's on the upper right hand monitor.  Yeah.  What's in the middle one situations, lots and lots of situations.  I saw Dr. Sanjay Gupta over there embedded with the troops at the beginning of the war. 
[02:07:00]  He and the others of you in the mainstream media refuse to ask our leaders the hard questions  and demand the honest answers.  And that's why we're in this war.  We're in the fifth year of this war because you and CNN, Dr. Gupta, you didn't do your  jobs back then.  And now here we are in this mess.  What if you'd actually done the job on that?  Yeah, that's why anybody who hears anything of what you say now about universal health  care should question what you're saying, what you're putting out there.  You didn't do the job for us with the war. 
[02:07:30]  You're not doing it with this issue.  And I just I just wonder when the American people are going to turn off their TV sets  and quit listening to this stuff.  Ain't going to happen.  One thing that's interesting to me, and again, I'd love to ask Michael more of this.  Wolf Blitzer could obviously jump in and respond.  Yeah, I'm wondering.  And again, I could be completely naive.  Does he on some base level agree?  And yet he has to toe the company line.  Well, that's a really good observation.  I think most reporters are more liberal than they are conservative. 
[02:08:00]  I think more guys who are especially over at CNN are more likely to agree with him and  disagree with him.  And maybe on some very base level, Wolf agrees with him.  I don't know.  I could be wrong.  Maybe Wolf tore into him after.  You know, perhaps they have hung out again when we were sitting chatting with Michael Moore  one evening.  You know, I got along with him fine.  And believe me, we were pretty far apart on our ideology.  But we're pretty close together on just being guys. 
[02:08:30]  You know, the guy isn't a bad guy to kind of just talk to.  But his ideology, me and him are pretty far apart.  But he said something cool to us because he knew about us.  We went to that Beatles thing that was a waste of time back in the day, about four or five  years ago.  And we were fired at that time.  We weren't on the radio.  And he's like, you guys got to get back because radio and media in general will always need  the Sex Pistols.  And he thought we were kind of like the Sex Pistols, just effing things up constantly 
[02:09:00]  to make it interesting.  And I thought that was kind of cool coming from him.  I never forgot that.  The monkey wrench being thrown into the works.  All right.  We got to wrap up on this side of the Opie and Anthony show.  Damn it.  You know what, though?  Anthony has to help us out with the plug.  I did an awful.  I'll admit it.  It hurts to admit this, but I did an awful job with the ticket plug.  Jimmy, you're a much better author, Jimmy.  A much better author.  Happy endings.  You know, doing very well.  But as far as plugging our comedy show. 
[02:09:30]  May I, just for tonight, DC?  Yes.  Barnes & Noble.  Yes.  Ann Street Northwest.  Yes.  Tomorrow is Buffalo Borders.  Yes.  Walden Avenue.  And also tomorrow night is Rochester, New York.  Yes.  Borders.  All right.  All right.  And we got a lot going on as far as our comedy show goes.  Yes.  A week from Saturday is Mansfield.  What do we got going on, Anthony?  Well, here we go.  It's the $10 ticket Tuesday promotion that we're talking about.  For Mansfield?  Oh, Mansfield.  Anthony, you've already ruined it.  I don't care about the Mansfield thing. 
[02:10:00]  Why?  It's for the military.  For the troops.  I know, but I don't have that in front of me.  Oh, my God.  You told me specifically to take care of this.  Hold on.  White shoes.  Oh, my God.  Nurse shoes.  Michael Caine at the end of Dressed to Kill Shoes is walking in.  Yeah.  Kenny and...  Kenny's wearing nurse shoes.  With travel day shoes and his short shirt, Mansfield, next week, Twitter Center, free.  If you have military ID, Iraqi sword being swung is optional.  You will receive free admission because it's a thing we're doing for the soldiers. 
[02:10:30]  That's a week from Saturday.  In Mansfield, a week from Saturday.  And you get seats in the pavilion, not on the lawn.  Good seats.  All you have to do is show a military ID and they go, come on in.  Hoorah.  They get a whole section reserved for the military.  That is cool.  I'm psyched that we're finally doing something substantial for the military.  Now.  Now.  Ah.  The $10 ticket Tuesday promotion, my friends, begins this coming Tuesday, 9 a.m.  Ticketmaster, of course. 
[02:11:00]  Detroit, Washington, D.C., and PNC in Holmdale, New Jersey.  Listen up.  This is for you.  Detroit, Washington, D.C., and PNC in Holmdale, New Jersey.  $10 lawn tickets.  Now, this is from 9 a.m. Tuesday until midnight Tuesday.  That's it.  Philly.  This is just for you, Philly.  And why is it just for Philly, Anthony?  Because Philly rules.  They treated us great.  So Detroit sucks?  No, we haven't been there yet. 
[02:11:30]  I'm sure they'll treat us great, too.  Jersey sucks?  Yeah, Jersey sucks.  Just saying that.  It smells.  What the hell's going on on that turnpike?  I'm sick of my girl looking at me.  Was that you?  I'm like, no.  How many times are you going to ask me?  You've got to say it first.  You've got to go, oh, Jersey.  Jeez, this stinks.  But if you've got to cut one while you're driving, you can blame it on Jersey.  Between exit 8 and 14.  Anytime you see the refineries and stuff.  Anywhere between the GW and Delaware Memorial Bridge.  Look at us going local for the whole turnpike. 
[02:12:00]  I like the swim.  Okay, now what about Philly?  Philly, Philly, this is for you.  $10 lawn tickets from 9 a.m. Tuesday until Friday at 5 p.m.  So you've got Tuesday until Friday, $10 lawn ticket for Philly.  We're calling a special thank you to Philly for being so cool to us the last couple of days.  And thank you for all the instant feedbacks and the emails and the phone calls from people in Philly saying,  hey, it was really cool having you guys.  That was nice to see.  Thank you.  And once again, thanks to YSP for having us the last couple of days. 
[02:12:30]  All right, well, we're out of here.  Have a great weekend.  If you're not joining us on XM Satellite Radio.  Radio.  If you can't show, the virus is spreading.  Nothing but dramatic music.  It's nonsense.  Very important.  It really is nonsense.  We'll acknowledge that.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We're live.  It's XM Satellite Radio.  Hi. 
[02:13:00]  We were just talking in the back room.  We need to do a couple of things in the next couple of weeks with the radio show.  We need to do car crash comedy for New York.  That was a lot of fun.  That was amazing down in Philly.  Yes.  So coming soon to the show, car crash comedy for New Yorkers.  We want to take this on the road.  We've done Philly so far.  We'll do New York hopefully in a week or two.  There you go.  And we also want to finally just nail down a date for What the Hell is That?  Part 2.  What the hell is that?  What a great, great thing. 
[02:13:30]  That promo that Steve runs is unbelievable.  Yeah.  So what we have to do is just say, all right, we're going to do it on this date and let's  get it done.  Get her done.  Get her done.  So we got to do that in the very, very near future.  Okay?  Yes.  So coming soon to the show, car crash comedy for New York and What the Hell is That?  Part 2.  We're waiting for my pal, my brother, Brother Weez. 
[02:14:00]  You're going to be up there in western New York doing the book signings, right, Jimmy?  I am, like in Rochester and I had put, you hear an echo?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, I put the phone down just in case he jumps on and says, hey.  I had wanted to do Brother Weez's show.  And again, I didn't want to impose.  It was probably very close and we were probably tough to break up, right?  Did you do that thing where you went off to college and you were going to try to stay  together and then it's...  That's exactly what happened.  Let me get up.  Oh, let him do our radio today.  Ow.  I was hoping you were going to do like five or ten minutes and we'll just sit here and 
[02:14:30]  listen to you and then we don't have to do our show.  And then you disappoint me and you're like, just stop the subject to get to us.  Oh, but you show up.  I'm there for you, brother.  I know that.  And I know we got a mission.  I just want to tell you, I got two comedians in the studio.  But also, I got a young boy who, his name's Carl Garitano and he was a New York State  football champion for our local, you know, one of our high schools.  And as a matter of fact, they beat Rockland.  What was the name of the...  North Rockland.  North Rockland from over by where you're at.  And then he just finished four years at Fordham where he was a football player. 
[02:15:00]  And now he's here and he wants to be on radio.  So, you know, this is boring to you, but I was asking him how he broke up with his cheerleader  girlfriend when he went to college.  Oh.  You know what?  Yeah, that's got to be a tough thing to do, break up with your cheerleader girlfriend.  Why would someone work so hard and go to so much school to get into radio?  Jesus.  That's a great question.  That is a great question.  I think he went to college to play football.  Yeah.  Well, how did he actually break up with her?  That's what I wanted to know, but then you called. 
[02:15:30]  Well, it was a long...  No, we want to know.  Let's do this together.  All right.  Long distance.  It didn't work out pretty much.  She was there.  I was here.  No, see, that's the lame crap.  We don't want to know that.  We understand that you left.  She's here.  We know that.  We want to know what you told the poor chick.  What was the phone call?  The phone call.  That's what we want to know.  I took a little mini vacation.  Okay.  Didn't call her until late.  She ends up calling me off the hook, text message, all that stuff.  See, once again, I need to call her this up.  You went somewhere and back to other broads.  When I came down, you back to other broads. 
[02:16:00]  That's what vacation means.  I mean, I try to keep it clean for a while I was with her in high school, but when you're  away, it's an area code difference and stuff.  So you went on a vacation and she called and said, what the hell are you doing?  Yeah.  Well, no, I didn't.  I can't use my phone in that situation.  I'm out with another broad.  I can't.  Okay.  Now you're talking.  I silenced it.  I silenced it, man.  Okay.  You don't have to silence the door.  We're digging for it, but it's nice to that.  So the next day, you know, I got to make the call.  I'm with my buddy, girls in the room, whatever.  I got to make the call.  So I leave.  And she's still at school, so I mean, now you know her cheerleader coach is right 
[02:16:30]  ugly.  Her cheerleader coach works here.  I wouldn't doubt it.  She does.  Yeah.  Oh, by the way, these are champion cheerleaders.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, so she had no problem.  Probably an hour later after that phone call, she was already back to the mattress.  Before the phone call.  During the phone call.  But was it easy or hard?  It was hard because we'd be there for a long time.  That's what I'm saying.  So how long did she torture you?  On the phone?  No, I mean, how many days? 
[02:17:00]  Oh, days?  Years.  That's what I'm talking.  Now you're two hours ago.  I got a phone call.  Now you're talking.  You're talking.  Get off your back.  This is what I'm thinking.  Talk, girl.  Now listen.  Opiate ante on the phone because Brother Norton is coming to town.  Norton, you there?  Hi, Wheeze.  Yeah, I wanted to come do the show or something, but I don't think my agent followed through  with it or just requested if it was possible.  Are you kidding me?  No, you could have said it.  No, you're full of crackers.  Opiate would have called me.  We don't turn anybody down.  You would have been the headliner in a joint. 
[02:17:30]  Don't turn anybody down.  Yeah.  Obviously.  You're talking about some football dude.  No, but I mean.  Breaking up with his cheerleader girlfriend.  I said to my agent, I would like to try to do Brother Wheeze's show.  Is that possible to do a phone or to come in?  And my agent just probably didn't ask anybody.  So it's like it probably never got to you.  It didn't.  Yeah, my agent's a dope.  What comedians are in studio?  Demetrius Nicodemus, a black Greek dude, and a big, bald, white kid named P.J. Buttman. 
[02:18:00]  Buttland.  Excuse me.  Wow.  Don't ask the guy's name.  Can I ask what the black Greek guy is promoting?  No, he's here promoting his show tonight at the Comedy Club.  World Peace.  Oh, okay, cool.  All right, cool.  Stolen statues.  I don't know.  Freak.  Nothing.  All right.  Gotcha, Jim.  Speaking of the car crash comedy.  Hey, Norton.  Yes, sir.  You're going to be at Borders tomorrow at what time? 
[02:18:30]  I don't know.  I think 7.30.  I'm going to be there doing a signing for my book.  So I was just hoping that people would come out.  But I didn't want to just come on and plug.  I feel kind of guilty doing that.  Like, I wanted to come on and make a real appearance.  No, I'd rather.  Well, that would have been great if you could have come up or if you could have done a phone  or that way.  But I want to make sure people, I got the book in my hand for the first time I've ever  seen it is this second because I sent a producer down the hall to find one of these books.  And it's a really cool book.  I'm only pissed off that in the picture of you and Jeff Goldblum, you don't give the guy  credit. 
[02:19:00]  What, the guy who took the picture?  No, it's a good you.  Who the guy is in the picture?  Oh, I figured people knew it was Goldblum.  It's just my fat face and Goldblum signing something for someone else.  He's just completely distracted and irritated.  And in the other picture, my chin is cut off and there's a lot of ceiling room.  It was some stupid girl that took the picture.  I wanted to brain her.  I'm like, could you take a photo?  So she gets me standing there and she just snaps it with Goldblum signing something.  I'm like, thank you for nothing, stupid.  Why were you at a Goldblum signing? 
[02:19:30]  I was stalking Alan Alda for a photo.  I really was.  I was outside of Glendary, Glen Ross here in New York and Goldblum was signing something  else and I just walked over and bothered him for a few minutes.  Hey, you guys want to hear an Alan Alda impression?  Yes, sir.  All right.  All right.  Just close your eyes.  This is Alan Alda's left arm.  Yes.  Yes.  I see they're not impressed.  They're not supposed to be.  That's the beauty of it.  No, no, no.  That sounds and looks just like him, but they can't see it.  It's amazing.  That's taking off with our listeners and we don't know why. 
[02:20:00]  By the way, I see the picture of Norton and Alan Alda and that poor Alan Alda, this  guy's an inch from the box.  Oh, my God.  He's next to dead, my man over here.  I walked past him the other day and his pants are getting a little too high.  Now, I want to change the subject just for a second because I heard something terrible.  I heard Anthony got lucky at the Mohegan Sun.  Oh, he's a big gambler, Ant.  I was hammered. 
[02:20:30]  I was playing blackjack for hours and hours on end, just doing the max bet, and I raked  him.  I did a great job, wound up walking away with 50 grand.  Oh, he's got only a dream in the Weezer's world.  It was one of those situations, dude, I know what you're talking about, that it just never  happens.  No.  And it was one of those where you're like, oh, my God, I can't believe this.  And I was, thank God I was so hammered, and it was so early in the morning that I had  to walk away from the table.  Well, you were up 68 at one point. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, I was up to 68 grand at one point.  I dropped like 18 down to 50.  At least you weren't drunk enough to not leave at 50.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's it.  I was so hammered and tired, and I just said, you know, I'm going back to the room.  And I didn't even know until I got to the cage and they counted it all up.  It was like, oh, you want the security to take you up?  I'm like, what?  I'm not used to this security to take me up with, what, my receipts from the ATM?  Anthony, that frigging black jacket, I've been playing a ton of poker in the casinos.  And by the way, because of you dicks, believe it or not, I play at Bodog. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, yeah.  Are you still with or without?  Are you with or without, Anthony?  I actually, I'm with, I play there, but I also play on another one where I could put a  little money on there and play some cash games.  No, I'm playing for money at Bodog.  Oh, you are?  Okay, I wasn't sure if they wanted the, you know, there's some kind of scandal going on  with which companies still have money that you can play with and fake money. 
[02:22:00]  Because I play Bodog, but I also pop on full tilt every so often.  Well, listen, at least at my station, I mean, I've been playing on Bodog for a long time  only because I heard it on your show.  So, and I mean, I've been getting paid so far regularly.  I've been hearing some rumors.  But so far, I've gotten four different thousand dollar checks from that joint.  There's hardly anybody there, but.  Really?  Yeah, seriously.  You're kicking ass on there then.  No, it's okay.  I mean, it's the site's pretty, it's not very well populated, but, you know, you can get 
[02:22:30]  a game any time.  If I want to, go ahead.  Go ahead.  I was just going to ask, are you still going to those poker joints?  Yeah, I got great poker joints here in town.  I shouldn't say on the radio.  When Wee's was getting his chemo here in New York, I mean, like, dude, just rest.  But he was going out and going to these underground poker games in the middle of nowhere.  And then one of them got busted.  Right.  You know, that's the one that was called the PlayStation.  Have you guys heard of it? 
[02:23:00]  It's not there, so I can say their name.  And, you know, I don't know if I introduced you to Fat Anthony that was running a joint, but that  was the one where one of those New York Yankees went in.  A-Rod.  A-Rod went in the joint.  It was in the paper.  And then they busted him.  Yeah, he was heavy into some of the poker clubs.  And once they found out, he had to be a good boy and not go to him anymore.  But one last thing I wanted to tell Anthony, when I'm at the casino playing poker, because  I'm a degenerate gambler, I have to find a way to my room without walking past blackjack. 
[02:23:30]  Because when you walk by blackjack, you sit down with a gee whiz.  And, man, they eat you.  Man, you got...  Oh, I know.  The fact that you won 50 grand, it's a goddamn miracle.  That blackjack, no matter...  You're right.  You get 20, the guy takes three cards and makes 21.  You want to kill him.  It never fails.  You're absolutely right.  It just never fails.  You could sit there and go, all right, at least I'm sitting on, you know, a pair of queens  here.  I got a 20.  The dealer's showing a 7.  Yeah.  So, you know, every other time they got a picture card under there.  So I'm looking at a 17. 
[02:24:00]  You start counting your money, and they flip over that 7, and there's another 7 underneath  it, and then they pull up another 7 on top of that.  You're like, what the hell's going on here?  So I can play poker all night and get lucky and win 900, something little like that, and  walk by poker, go into my room, blackjack, and in 10 minutes, give them the whole friggin'  thing.  Everything.  Yeah.  Because you got to, you know, if you lose enough, you got to make up for it, and you  can in one hand.  Yes, you can.  That always works when you just go, oh, let me just put all this on one hand. 
[02:24:30]  That's it.  And then they don't even give you the chance to try to win, because they turn the card  over, because they have blackjack.  Uh-huh.  That's no fun.  Oh, is that annoying.  Hey, one of our listeners, Wheeze, he's saying that Bodog has been sending you checks for the  on-air mentions, not for the winnings.  I only wish.  I only wish, my brother.  They ain't giving me a...  Hey, by the way, we got Michael Moore in about an hour here, Wheeze.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to tell you, so I didn't want to start with Norton.  I wanted to respect him, because he's coming to town to sign his book at Borders tomorrow. 
[02:25:00]  No, go with it, man.  Listen, I saw Sicko.  The critics saw Sicko.  It's a phenomenal movie.  And before you...  Just give me 60 seconds before Norton beats me up.  This movie, this movie, the right-wingers that want to belittle this movie, they've been  on TV.  The stuff that they found that might not be true is benign.  Go see the movie, one of you guys, before you beat it up.  Well, you know what?  You know what?  I loved it.  I thought it was great.  Yeah, I thought it was a good movie, man. 
[02:25:30]  You're not going to get an argument here.  I think that...  It sucks.  I'm sure he has his perspective skewers.  I like Michael Moore more than I used to.  And I really like the movie.  I think even if there are certain things skewered, like any documentary maker will do,  you cannot defend the insurance companies.  And I loved what he did with that.  They are scum.  And there are certain things that are irrefutable.  I mean, and I thought he did a great job with it.  Well, what kills me is when the right-wing media comes out to try and beat this dude  up, how can they beat up when you see that lady from the health insurance say that they 
[02:26:00]  get paid to deny?  You saw the terrible things.  People were talking about people with health insurance.  People with health insurance that died because they were denied access to a certain treatment.  It's disgusting.  Yeah, it really is that they will send a very sick person.  I mean, maybe not with a gunshot wound, but they'll send you to another provider before  they'll take care of you in the hospital you walk into.  It really is.  That's kind of repulsive.  And nobody has said, hey, this is not true. 
[02:26:30]  Nobody.  And believe me, they would like to say it.  How about the nut lady that they drop off on the street in her hospital clothes?  Well, they had to have a little comedy in the movie there, Ruiz.  Yeah, that kind of sucks it up.  Sucks it up.  The only thing I can say about it is he obviously enjoys Canada and the way they handle their  health care system there.  I'm sure you do.  But my argument, and it will be with him too, is this country is not ready for any type of  socialized program to that degree. 
[02:27:00]  We can't, the rich are a very small portion of the people that will pay for the poor who  are a very large portion of people that will take advantage of anything socialized in this  country.  We're not used to it.  Like, you know how Russia, when the Iron Curtain came down and all of a sudden they had democracy  dumped in their lap, they didn't know how to handle it.  Like, we won't know how to handle any socialized program to that extent because we have too many  people that, A, will take advantage of it, and B, don't want to part with their money  to pay for it. 
[02:27:30]  So, what are you going to do with 48 million uninsured people, and even worse, according  to Sicko, the people that have health insurance, we're getting screwed by those HMO people like  we can't believe.  Yeah, but the thing is, the people that are paying for this are the wealthy.  We're not talking about socialized medicine, the wealthy are paying for it through higher  taxes.  The poor in this country have a great way of taking advantage of any type of government  program.  I'm hearing you, but all I'm saying is, we can't go on the way we are when you see this 
[02:28:00]  movie.  I'm not saying what the answer is.  I understand that, but I think a better answer than trying to emulate Canada and have a socialized  medical program is getting the insurance company and the doctors in line and not have these  pharmaceutical companies paying off the doctors, charging hundreds of thousands of dollars  for medication that doesn't cost that much.  That's where the real answer lies, and I think that could help a lot more than trying to turn 
[02:28:30]  a little socialism on in this country.  By the way, when you do the Michael Moore, that'll be on XM?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I can hear that all day and night.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I've actually gotten more liberal in the last couple of years, I guess because of all the  stuff I've seen happening on radio, which is coming from pretty conservative influence.  I've gotten more liberal in the last couple of years.  It's kind of annoying me, but I am.  I find myself hyphenating when I talk, like, well, he's an African-American.  What?  What did I say? 
[02:29:00]  It was so easy when it was just one word.  Yes.  I go to borders about it, and I just debate with nothing.  I enjoyed that very much.  I mean, we had a very fun debate, but, like, on the sicko thing, I would completely agree  with you.  I mean, I...  That's why you're getting lame.  I like those right-wingers that stick up for every piece of crap that comes out of the  right.  You're not doing it.  I can't.  It's just driving me nuts.  I want a bleeding-heart liberal president right now.  I really...  I want someone that thinks pornography is fantastic, and that even the seven dirty words should be 
[02:29:30]  allowed on radio.  It's killing us.  That would be very nice.  By the way, a conservative called me up to beat me up.  The other day about the Michael Moore movie, and then he got to this...  Once he crapped out and had nothing, he went to the fact that I demean women, and I go,  which I don't even do.  That's your guy's job.  I'm a pussy.  I'm a half abroad myself.  I got estrogen.  And the guy goes...  The guy goes, wait, listen.  The guy says to me, do you approve of strip joints, Wheeze?  I go, of course I approve of strip joints. 
[02:30:00]  You demean women.  I go, what are you talking about?  I'm not even a strip joint fan.  I'm lame as hell, but I'm not going to take it away from Norton.  Thank you.  A lot of people do love them.  Because you're a big star in Rochester, and a lot of women will sleep with you.  Norton needs the strip clubs.  Norton needs the strip clubs.  Anyway.  Norton doesn't...  Then the guy...  What was it that the other thing was even worse?  Oh, check this out.  Yeah, this was not...  This was so lame.  It's hard for me to put this on the air, but once, many, many, many, many years ago, I 
[02:30:30]  let a guy give me a knob job.  You understand?  I love this story.  Did you really?  Yeah.  I'm not going to tell you guys the whole story, but it's been on this show a few times.  He told me on the way to a Bills game one year.  On a party party.  It better have been in a foxhole with a North Vietnamese talk about five yards away.  It was connected to that.  It was involved with that story.  But listen, I just want to give you the point about this dickwad that calls me up to try 
[02:31:00]  and beat me up.  Because after he went through sicko and an eye to mean women, he goes about...  He said you're a bad father for telling that story on the radio because of the abuse it  would put on your kids.  So check this out.  I have a kid that's 19 years old.  I told that story when he was about four.  Nothing's happened to him.  I thought in debating skills class, I win.  Because I have a kid that's 19.  He's been around for like 15 years in that story and no one's ever said anything to him.  So that makes that statement completely full of crap. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, it's not affecting the children.  You know what would be great though if I said, why did the guy give you a knob job?  And you said, well, he needed book plugs.  And then I realized...  You know what?  It's not fair to our audience.  So you got to give the quick story now.  Yeah, I'm dying to know that because he's a man's man.  Well, here's the story.  I'll tell it as nicely as I can.  I went to Vietnam three different times.  And on one of my trips home, I'm a 19-year-old freaking dude. 
[02:32:00]  I'm out drinking with all the fellas.  I was 18 was the age back in that time in New York State, let me just say.  And we're out at the bar.  We're drinking all night, trying to do what all dudes do, get laid.  And I was not the best-looking dude in town.  And getting laid was not happening for me that evening.  So at 2.30 in the morning, I went to the local diner with all the drunk guys.  You know we all do that, right?  And this gay kid from high school was there.  And he came up to me and he said, you know, now we're, you know, I'm in Vietnam. 
[02:32:30]  He's in college.  We're just 19.  And the dude said, I always wanted to win with me.  Oh, you had a hair lift?  You had a hair lift.  He said, I was not a hair lift.  You had to talk with his mouth full.  And I said, you know, I think I'll give it a shot because I'm dying to get off.  You just sat there.  So hold on a minute.  I take him over to my father's house right around the corner.  Oh, that was in the car.  This was at the house.  Oh, he's just classy. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, nice.  I mean, there was wine and everything.  No.  Oh, I took him over to my house.  It's now about 3 o'clock in the morning.  Oh, that's good.  And I'll tell you something.  I can remember it to this day.  And I forgot a lot of bronze.  Yeah.  I can remember it to this day.  The bristles made it stand out.  And I say this when you argue.  I mean, there's so many men that this freaks out.  You know, it's a bunch of crap.  If I could, what's the difference?  I didn't touch this freaking guy.  The guy gave me a knob.  Hold on, hold on.  You didn't correct his head or anything?  I didn't do nothing.  How do you get a knob and not even touch the guy's head? 
[02:33:30]  Easy.  You don't even know.  You go, bro, that's great, man.  That is awesome.  You're hitting it.  You're hitting it.  Yeah, he was that good.  He didn't even have to steer him around with his hands or nothing.  And I love the rules.  It's not gay if you're not touching the guy's head.  I love that one.  To play devil's advocate, you could have been a better egg about that and returned the favor.  It would have been acceptable.  What kind of...  No.  Oh, now we've gone too far.  No, no, no.  The whole thing is I want to tell guys that are uptight about all this crap.  Number one, you know how women, they say, know how to eat the peach a lot better than dudes? 
[02:34:00]  Sure.  They got one.  Yes.  Well, this dude was a pro schmeckles.  And that was some piece of a thing that went down there.  He was the A-run of his situation.  Absolutely.  Now, I'm going to tell you, I never went back.  But it was...  It was more...  Times were crazy.  This guy was a professional.  Right.  That was something.  Wow.  What happened to that guy, you think?  He's dead.  Is he?  He died in the early AIDS epidemic.  Oh, wow.  Really, he did?  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  I was hoping maybe you'd get a phone call someday. 
[02:34:30]  Hello, wheeze.  Yeah, like maybe if we hooked back up again.  Imagine that.  Just some guy.  All these years later.  I might call him back over.  But anyways, Jim Norton's book is called Happy Endings.  Brother Norton's going to be right out there by Marketplace Mall.  Borders.  Borders books.  Signing these books.  And these books are not only very funny, because Norton's one of the funniest comics in the country,  but it's got pictures.  Pictures of celebrities with the Norton.  And I have to say, Norton, let you talk. 
[02:35:00]  That fat broad thing you hosted, I'm looking at?  Yes.  What's the deal there?  Well, I wanted it because I wanted to get the biggest disaster I could on the cover in a massage position.  And so I said, would fat fans please email?  And I should have just said, would any female fans we have please email?  Well, and boy, was she the hands-down winner.  I got that.  I opened the PDF file, and I just, the heavens opened.  And I'm like, you slob, get on a bus.  And now she's on the cover of your, she's on the cover of the booklet.  That's not even what I was referring to. 
[02:35:30]  I'm referring Norton to page 20.  Is this the Fatty Pig Fatty contest?  No, this is the Babe Fest for YSP in Philadelphia.  Oh, the one who was riding me on, I was on my hands and knees, she was riding me like I was a pony.  Oh my God.  She was like on my back.  Oh my God.  Now you guys know you're all going to hell for this fat broad thing.  Yeah, she was a plus-size delight.  YSP hired her just to kind of spank me in front of 3,000 people, and I allowed it to be a good egg. 
[02:36:00]  And I never spoke to her again, though.  I think I just was kind of grossed out by the whole thing, because she had fat, sweaty legs.  I'll never forget that.  I could feel her legs sweating through my shirt as she rode me around like a pony on a stage.  You keep saying it was her legs.  Hey, by the way, who's the dude you're interviewing?  I don't have time to read the text.  There's nothing under the picture.  You seem to be interviewing some rock and roll guy on page, like, 224.  Do you know who that is?  Um, oh no.  You guys don't have a book sitting there?  No, Nathaniel's running together. 
[02:36:30]  It wasn't Paul Stanley, was it?  Oh yeah, it was.  That's who it is.  Paul Stanley from Kiss?  You know, it's funny you bring that up, because Norton, you can hate me later, but I think you have the worst taste in music in the world.  But I guess for your audience, it's good.  But Kiss, we just did a set on Kiss about a half an hour ago.  So that friggin' Gene Simmons, got to be, I'm ashamed to be a Hebrew with that friggin' Israeli, because you can't get lamber than that son of a bitch.  Wait, you don't like the same music I do?  You don't like Sabbath? 
[02:37:00]  Let me tell you something.  When we get together, I'll tell you my Ozzy stories.  Really?  Because I spent time with Ozzy.  Do you like him?  I said no.  Not necessarily.  But you felt bad for him.  I feel bad.  I always felt bad for him.  I'm talking about before.  Before he had the hives.  How about one night in Syracuse?  This is years ago.  One night in Syracuse when he was doing the set where he wore a toga, and it was all that Roman stuff.  And he broke out in hives backstage because Sharon wasn't with him. 
[02:37:30]  This is for the kids.  Really?  Jeez.  And I felt so bad for his fans, his macho fans out there that were thinking he was some macho dude.  And backstage he was crying for his whole life.  For the chance of Ozzy.  Let me tell you something, Jim.  Ozzy, whatever he is, I'm sure a nice human being.  I've spent time.  I mean, Sharon is the whole energy behind all that.  Yeah, she's definitely, he said that in interviews.  He said every successful man has a straw woman behind him with a good left boot.  He's very, he acknowledges the fact that Sharon is the boss and that he's terrified of her. 
[02:38:00]  She made him.  She rescued him.  I mean, he was in a hotel room with pizza boxes on him doing drugs in 1979.  Sharon picked him up and encouraged him to do Blizzard of Oz.  I'd say without her there would have been no song.  Sharon's father owned Jet Records.  Yeah, Don Arden.  Yeah, he was kind of an SOB.  And I don't know if you've ever seen a picture of Sharon from today, but it's a completely different person.  Ooh, Glee.  She was a fat, ugly broad.  She wasn't lovely.  She must have had a lot of personality.  She could have been on the cover of your book. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, back in 1981, she didn't look great.  But Norton, this Gene Simmons guy, he's heinous.  I'm telling you.  He is an ass.  He is.  We openly admit that except for Jimmy.  Well, and I apologize for talking over you.  I'm hearing an echo.  I know you guys aren't hearing it, but that's why I keep starting and stopping because I don't want to step on you.  Hey, listen, I'm going to let you guys go.  Hey, Norton, I got a show tomorrow, a music show I do from 10 to noon.  I'm going to promote your book.  I hope everybody will come out and see Brother Norton.  You've got to come to the club and work. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, well, your best friend JJ is here.  He said he'd give you $75 to play at Commons Cafe.  I would be very happy to do that.  You almost punched him in Montreal at a dinner with us.  I don't blame you.  Don't worry about it.  I don't know if you remember.  Oh, I kind of do.  Oh, yeah, we had a nice dinner.  We were off the air.  Yeah, I do remember that.  We had a great time that night.  Yeah, and he offered you like $100 to do a set up here because you told him about what goes on in New York.  There's a live story.  Hey, you want to do a set tomorrow night for real?  What time is your show? 
[02:39:30]  No, no, seriously.  No, he's talking about the comedy club.  No, no, I know.  I'm saying what time is the comedy show?  It's any time you go.  There's an all night.  Yeah, I would love to do a set.  If I can get out of the signing on time, which hopefully I won't because there's too many people,  but if I can get out of the signing, I definitely will.  I'll bring my recorder.  I want to do sets because I'm doing Kimmel the 24th, so I need as many sets as I can get.  JJ, if Norton shows up, give him a couple thousand and put him on the table.  Of course he's in.  Look at JJ.  He's in.  He's in.  Of course he is.  Thank you, JJ.  By the way, did I tell you that JJ's got a club in Aruba? 
[02:40:00]  Oh, really?  Yes.  Anybody interested?  Norton, you interested in a week in Aruba?  I'll expect it's gorgeous.  Nice tax shelter.  Yeah, I would love to.  You wouldn't want to go there, right?  What's it called?  I'd like to perform in the Natalie Holloway room.  That's why he gets the big bucks.  That was good.  Thank you, Weed.  Oh, how come you're not coming, bro?  I'm thinking of jumping on a plane tomorrow.  Well, let me know.  A little JetBlue action.  Call my ass.  All right.  How's the cottage? 
[02:40:30]  See you tomorrow, bro.  We're going to pound this.  Thanks so much, Weed.  I appreciate it.  I really do.  Anthony, stay lucky, you bastard.  Thank you, man.  50,000 sons of the rich guy.  Rich guy.  I got lucky.  All right.  The great brother, Weed.  He's a stand-up guy.  He's great, man.  And it's interesting to listen, like as he's interviewing that guy, how he's like, you always  said he was good at taking a regular guy and making them interesting.  But it's great watching him pull facts out of somebody.  It doesn't look like he's, he just looks like he's a guy hanging out with a guy, but he's 
[02:41:00]  really pulling facts out of the dude.  Yeah.  It's really interesting.  He was getting stuff out of that guy.  But the audience can't hear.  There's just an echo in the headphones.  They really effed us up.  Yeah, because it was so weird.  Like, we're talking to him, but then I'm like, he starts, I'm like, oh, that's me.  I'm hearing it.  Wait, but I'm not going to hear it.  That's why it was so awkward.  Yeah, that's why you got a couple of stepped-on moments.  Yeah, that's all that was.  It was the echo.  Now we don't hear it.  He was loving it.  That's why I kept us on so long.  Yeah, he was, he's very good, man.  Reese is the man.  I have a bad pain in my ear.  What happened?  Oh, no.  What happened, Jimmy?  It's a consistent pain I get with wearing headphones. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, is it the headphones?  No, I get that, too.  If we keep the headphones on too long, that's when it happens.  It almost feels like there's a knot in there in the back.  Ow.  It only happens when we're on, like, for a really long time.  But you don't think that's a tumor?  It could be.  It could be.  Yeah, it definitely could be.  Oh, you're fine, genie.  Speaking of tumors, can we get Big A or some kind of Big A update?  Yeah, I want to hear.  I heard the tumor's out.  Did they do the test on it?  Is he okay?  We'll get an update after.  Big A.  Try to get an update.  Is he able to talk? 
[02:42:00]  I don't know.  Is he ever?  Yeah.  Jeez, good point.  Imagine, like we said the other day, he gets on the phone and now he talks completely normal.  I know.  And then we have no use for him.  Big A, how are you?  I'm feeling much better.  Great.  Wonderful.  It would be great if they were wheeling him out and just ready to put him under.  And the doctor goes, okay, you don't have to worry.  We'll take off that diseased leg in a minute.  And he goes, no, it's my leg.  Oh, too late.  Yeah, there it goes.  And he just knows, like he's trying to say it's not my leg and they hack it off. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  But he's still awake through the operation.  Like a big wounded animal.  He just has to lay there.  Like a fucking giant sea lion.  It must look like when they tag a bear or something and just sits there with the tongue hanging out.  They don't let him go like in a wheelchair to his car.  They just take a cage, put it outside and lift up the front.  Just scare him out of it.  The best transformation, by the way, was Tibby Tom.  When they sobered him up. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, yeah.  And we talked to him in the hospital and it was a completely different voice.  It was probably...  Tibby Tom's like this, just talking about getting drunk and hanging out and getting stoned.  And then he was sober as a judge.  He's in the hospital talking to us on the phone and he's like, well, let me tell you something.  He was the gayest guy ever.  The doctors here have been fabulous with treating me.  I've shaved.  They've fed me some fabulous food. 
[02:43:30]  We had to send someone to the hospital because we thought someone...  To confirm it.  Because we thought someone was putting us on.  He just sounded like he walked right off the gay parade line for an interview.  Yeah.  The guy...  But when he's drunk, he's...  I'm all man by the dumpster.  Reading from Whack Bag.  Should Wee's really be saying pound this after the blowjob story?  Ah.  That's some story.  Jesus Christ.  Good for him.  He didn't even try to pretend that she had a dress on or anything. 
[02:44:00]  No.  It was just...  He was a guy I used to know.  Yeah.  And he blew me.  I was in a diner.  I had a rod.  You know how it goes.  How do you not love that?  Fucking Wee just yanked it out.  Ah.  Suck it.  Ah.  What a trooper.  All right.  We're going to continue in just a bit here, obviously.  But there's...  I have to Tinkle Ope.  Oh.  Oh, Washington tonight.  Get that book signing in.  Yes.  It's a 3040 M Street Northwest.  I think JFK's been hitting it.  And, you know, I'm doing that tonight at 7.30 p.m.  And I'm hoping that people come to the Barnes & Noble.  The signings have been great, man. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  The fans have been...  It's fucking...  It's fun, man.  It's really cool to see.  Really fun.  Really, really meeting a lot of nice people at the signings.  Yeah, man.  It's more normal.  I had...  Oh.  Someone's got to send the...  I signed a guy's ass last night.  Ooh.  Yes.  I didn't have a pen.  With your cock?  Yeah, of course.  Sorry.  Why did I have to set it up with...  I didn't have a pen.  Why did I not...  Why did I have to go right for the obvious?  Sorry.  I just...  Paltalk just went over.  My foot just hit the headphones at Rapp around Paltalk.  Sorry.  Okay.  No, there was a guy who said, could you sign my ass? 
[02:45:00]  And I'm like, all right.  It's a ghoul fault.  I was in front of a homeroom full of people.  And he had...  I have to say, the cheeks were almost...  Marbled.  It was almost a work of art.  Really?  But they were hairy and disgusting.  Thank God.  I could see it was a guy's ass that way.  Oh, wow.  So, because if it was no hair, you would have thought a girl's ass would have made you a  little excited.  No, I wouldn't say excited, but I mean, I would have probably said, well, that's nice.  Yeah.  And fucked it.  No.  Okay.  What?  It's not gay.  If you just take your cock and go like this between the cheeks. 
[02:45:30]  Ah, a little...  Just a little slap.  Kenny?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Here comes the showstopper.  Well?  Yes, Kenny.  I don't want to be the bearer of bad news.  Oh, this is a nice fun thing.  Uh-huh.  On Friday the 13th.  Oh, Jesus.  Thanks for the reminder.  Oh, no.  Is it really?  Yeah.  This should be your birthday.  Thank you.  Happy birthday.  He's fucking under a ladder with a black hat in front of him.  A broken mirror.  Yeah, that's true.  All right.  We have five things equal a good joke.  Go ahead.  You would know. 
[02:46:00]  He's so funny.  That's the difference between me and him.  And he's a good author, too.  All right.  What's up?  Author.  What's up with the nurse shoes, really?  They're fucking awful.  They're brand new white sneakers.  You found the worst sneakers possible to buy.  Why?  They're brand new.  White is the symbol of purity.  Wow.  I got really mad.  Well, you know how he says they're brand new.  They're probably like, fuck, because Kenny's a chiseler.  They're probably like 1997 white shoes that he hasn't gotten a speck of anything except 
[02:46:30]  I got him for Father's Day.  All right.  I'm sorry.  Was it a gift?  Was it a gift?  Yeah.  Yeah.  From one of my siblings.  All right.  I'm sorry.  My offspring.  Siblings.  My offspring, I meant to say.  Now I know why he got mad.  No, no.  Yeah.  He's a very defensive father.  Of course he is.  He loves those boys.  I sure do.  And he's proud of the one in the Air Force there.  Yes.  Godspeed.  Godspeed.  Godspeed.  Off we go into the wild blue yonder.  Right?  The security forces he's going to follow in his father's footsteps. 
[02:47:00]  Oh.  Very proud.  Very proud.  And then, of course, Douglas is just a terrific young lad.  He's a golfer now taking after you.  Maybe you can go out on the links with him.  And getting very, very tall.  Yes.  How tall is he?  He shot up.  Eight feet.  He's getting up there.  Yeah.  He's really sprouting up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But the reason why I stepped up to the mic.  Oh.  Speaking of Jimmy's book signing last night, I'm surprised somebody didn't call in one of  those own midget sighting.  Midget sighting?  Maybe nobody knows what a midget is. 
[02:47:30]  What is a midget?  A magic midget.  Yeah.  It was, you know, a nice little person.  That's if Hyman Roth sees a short person.  If I see a midget, but they're people just like us.  Yeah.  No.  I love that show on TV.  Those little people.  I have feelings for midgets now because they're little people, big world.  Yeah.  They're a roll off.  More emotions coming into my heart.  I don't know why.  Yeah.  That's their name.  They roll off.  Why is this happening to me?  I feel for the little guys now.  Oh.  Yeah.  There was a midget sighting?  Yeah.  No.  A nice little little fella came and he stepped up to the table and reached up to put his book 
[02:48:00]  to sign it.  How sure was he?  He was like mini me size.  Very, very small.  Aw.  Yeah.  Really small?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, it could have done you good if he would have had to buy like 10 books and stack  them into stairs to walk up to you.  To meet the big star.  And then have another one for him to sign.  Yeah.  He's just a fan.  Aw.  Look at Jimmy now.  Jimmy's got feelings too.  Jimmy's an author now.  Now he's like, well, you know, they're all great people.  To tell you the truth.  A mere two months ago, you would have stepped over the little fella. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, you slammed him.  Kicked him out of the way to get to Starbucks quicker or something.  What you're missing is that he is just a fan.  However.  Yes.  I threw somebody $8 to slam their car into him.  Oh, okay.  And I had a debate with somebody whether he was a midget or one of them progeria kids.  Oh, really?  He's not an adult.  He's not progeria.  Progeria kids die young.  He was like fucking.  No, but he was a young guy.  A primordial dwarf is what I was going to say.  Could be that, too.  Yeah, whatever.  Different than the progeria kids.  Did he talk like this when he was arguing? 
[02:49:00]  Did he have that voice?  Yeah, he said, hi, Jimmy.  Yeah, because that's like, oh, Jimmy, I've been a big fan for many, many years.  I'm 22 years old, and I'm four foot nothing.  I need a couple of books.  Could you sign this?  To waste of life.  Oh.  That's just hurtful.  They are.  Words hurt.  Yeah, they do.  Yeah, especially in writing.  He's a nice guy.  If you're listening, thanks for coming to you.  Great.  I mean, thanks for coming, and good luck to you. 
[02:49:30]  Someone is suggesting that.  What did you say?  Midget?  Yeah.  That's how Popeye's.  Midget.  What time is our train, you idiot?  Isn't he terrific?  I love him.  I just love you guys.  Taking the choo-choo down.  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah, yeah.  That's privilege information I'm not going to give out over to you guys.  I'll tell you in private.  Okay, one o'clock.  Who's going to show up with this fucking monolith there with a pistol and bother me? 
[02:50:00]  Kenny's convinced that, you know, it's like the Beatles back in the day.  We give out a hotel or a train schedule that, oh my God, all hell's going to be around to get you.  Oh, the girls are going to be just running.  The hotel he's right about, because fans will call just to bug us.  They do that.  Yeah, they'll drive just to say hello.  Hey, Norton, you coming down?  You know, the thing is...  By the way, can we give the hotel a plug now that we're out of Philly?  Because they were great.  The next time we're in Philly, what happens?  Yeah, that's our new joint.  That's our home base.  That's our new joint.  Yeah. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  But anyway, I wanted to make a point.  Like, you guys work so hard that I want people to respect your off-duty time.  You know, in your private lives.  Now that the microphone's off.  Anyone talking?  I don't know what happened here, Mike.  I don't know.  It broke.  It's getting embarrassing.  I'm just trying to save shit.  I mean...  It's weird to hear you spinning things in a fun way.  Yeah.  Nobody likes it.  Yeah.  I know.  Nobody likes it.  Just point to the part on the...  Point to the tooth print on the laces part of your shoe.  Yeah, tell us where that perp... 
[02:51:00]  How far he flew when he kicked these...  Fucking dental imprints off the fucking soles of his shoes.  These shoes haven't had the pleasure yet.  I bet you his fucking old cop shoes are the Dentist Hall of Fame.  These shoes...  These shoes bought me a wing to my house.  I'm a pro.  You don't leave marks.  Yeah.  All right.  Now it got too serious.  We're going to have to check his dental records to ID him.  But I have only one pair of shoes. 
[02:51:30]  Yes.  I got to get home.  What am I supposed to do?  I could tell an interesting story, but it would be like hypothetically.  Okay.  Well, it would probably be somebody you didn't know or something.  Maybe I read it in a book or seen it in a movie.  No, let's use an example people would believe.  Maybe I read it in a book.  He's on fire today.  What was the last book you read there, Kenny? 
[02:52:00]  Last and first?  I haven't read a book in a very long time, but I'll tell you the first book I ever read,  I was 18 years old.  The first book I ever read cover to cover was Serpico.  Nice.  And that's when you decided you wanted to be a police officer.  Because he hated Serpico for being a rat, and he realized what he could get away with.  Yeah.  He was looking at the other side.  This is great.  That book should have been called Tattletail.  Okay. 
[02:52:30]  Where's the, what's the story?  Now, hypothetically, some rookie cop, some guy got locked up for something, and he wouldn't  get in the police car.  Right.  So, you know, sometimes when they're handcuffed, you try to go around the other side, pull  him through with the cuffs.  He wouldn't get in the car.  So, the rookie cop told the other cops to stand back, and the rookie cop gave him a stepping  side kick right into the midsection, and the guy doubled over, the rookie cop shoved his  head, stuffed him in the car, and took him to the precinct. 
[02:53:00]  The only problem was, that occurred on a dark street corner.  Yeah.  When they got to the lit up precinct, the rookie cop's shoe print was perfectly on the guy's  white t-shirt.  So, what did the rookie cop do?  Did he put eight more so it would look like a shirt pattern?  Did the rookie cop go, no, he bought it like that?  Those shoes belong to a guy named Charlie.  Charlie.  That's what happened, because this never happened.  Hypothetically. 
[02:53:30]  God, a little too much detail.  When does the Kenny book come out?  No kidding.  I think Kenny should write a book.  No, I want you guys to write a book.  Well, how interesting would that be?  Ixnay on the book A. It's all about Jim Norton and his happy endings.  Ixnay on the book A. Right. It's all about Jim Norton and his happy endings book.  I don't know.  I know.  It was by me.  That's the only way I do pig Latin, by the way.  Right. 
[02:54:00]  That's the only way I do it.  Thank you.  Hold on.  Say Dominus Plurus.  Wait, hold on.  Go.  Dominus Plurus.  That's pig Latin.  E-Rock threw something at me.  What did he throw besides, obviously, not food he was going to eat?  I don't know.  It's very similar to dummy Latin, so I wasn't able to get the translation.  Poor E-Rock.  E-Rock was right to throw something? 
[02:54:30]  Yes, he was.  Anthony was short-sighted and not car crashing me horribly.  No, I liked that.  I didn't even figure it out yet.  What about me?  You're just sweet.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Well, all right.  Can you leave?  Yes.  Thank you.  I have to tinkle badly.  So do I.  I got to wash my bag.  Contest?  What's the matter?  I'll be official.  Want to see who's bigger?  I think I could.  No.  Let's go helmet to helmet.  Helmet to helmet.  A couple of men. 
[02:55:00]  Warriors.  Being like a big X.  X marks the spot that men make.  I got two minutes in me easily.  You got a stopwatch?  No, I piss so sporadically because of my fucking.  My bladder problem.  I'm diagnosed.  Your iPhone has a stopwatch in it unless that's crashed too, fam.  All right.  We'll talk about the iPhone thing next because now we're starting something fresh, which could  be good.  Uh-huh.  And also we got Michael Moore coming.  Well, coming to a phone booth.  Coming to a phone near us.  Yeah.  Whatever.  He's going to be calling it.  Yes.  It's in about a half hour.  Cool. 
[02:55:30]  And I know there's no more phone booths out there, so shut up already, please.  Phone booths.  Before you.  I hope he's out of touch with phone technology.  Here's Secret Asia Man.  Club Soda Kenny, everyone.  There's a man who leads a life of danger.  To everyone he meets, he stays a stranger. 
[02:56:00]  With every move he makes, another chance he takes.  Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow.  Secret Agent Man.  Secret Agent Man.  They're giving you a number and taking away your name.  Beware of pretty faces that you find. 
[02:56:30]  A pretty face can hide an evil mind.  I'll be careful what you say or you'll give it all away.  Odds are you won't live to see tomorrow.  There he goes.  Secret Agent Man.  Secret Agent Man.  They're giving you a number and taking away your name. 
[02:57:00]  Is this the chorus?  Yeah.  I thought a little lead went here or something.  A little more Secret Agent Man there, right?  Yeah, but there's another first, but I don't know when to start.  Hold the direction.  We hold the direction for this big dumb thumb moving.  Here it comes, Secret Agent. 
[02:57:30]  Secret Agent Man.  Secret Agent Man.  They're giving you a number and taking away your name.  Swing in on the Riviera one day.  No.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We're looking at censored photos of Vanessa Manolo. 
[02:58:00]  Can we turn down the musical so we can hear it, Jimmy?  We don't have a lot of control of all our buttons right now.  And Nick Lachey.  Nick Lachey.  And I want to see her naked badly. 
[02:58:30]  Holy crap.  Is he having sex with her?  I would hope so.  Yeah.  He's been hanging here for a year.  X-rated honeymoon.  Wow.  Wait, do they get married?  I don't know.  He's giving her a deep...  And why do we care?  We're like little hens.  He is deep-ticking her from behind over here in that one picture.  It says, check out Nick's face.  Like, you have to...  Like, who wouldn't know?  That's their way of saying, look, he's fucking her good.  She's sexy, man.  Yeah, there's a leg up in the air.  Oh, this one where he's nailing her from behind. 
[02:59:00]  Look, he's got his fuck face on.  She's holding on for dear life.  How the fuck did they...  That's a telephoto lens, man.  Yeah, but are they on a balcony, or...  Where are they?  Hot tub in Mexico.  A hot tub, okay.  Outside their room or something?  Someone had just shitting it.  Everybody else jumped out.  I saw the video.  Where are these pictures?  Where can we tell people to go?  Eatabullet.com.  You dick.  Why?  There's a lot of fucking hot photos up there of Vanessa. 
[02:59:30]  So what?  I was telling Althea, I did two pilots with Vanessa.  And the first one I did...  Yeah.  And she's really...  She's very nice, actually.  And I thought, like, maybe...  I didn't even know she was an MTV VJ at the time.  But I'm just like, ah, she's just a chick they hired.  Yeah, she was just starting out when you ran the tour.  Now she's massive.  She's huge.  And I'm like, you know, I bet I could fucking maybe work this.  I had no idea how out of my league I was.  Yeah.  And then she was panicking because something had leaked in the New York Post.  And she's like, well, he said this and that. 
[03:00:00]  And I'm like, what?  Who is she?  And then someone said, oh, yeah, she's been banging Derek Jeter.  Oh, okay.  And I'm like, oh.  You had a shot.  I kind of put things into perspective.  Yeah, you had a shot.  She's just being nice to me because we're working together.  I was a little ashamed.  Little Jimmy Norton had high hopes.  It's amazing how fast you go from being an edgy comic to just little Jimmy Norton.  Little insecure Jimmy.  Stupid Jimmy.  Whose girl is running off with somebody a little more popular and handsome.  Okay, magazine. 
[03:00:30]  Had the photos.  And now they're up on TMZ.com.  That TMZ, boy.  But they're getting into some action.  She has, her body.  Is built for sex.  Her body was.  Let me see if I can say this radio friendly.  Oh, okay.  Her body was built for hubba hubba.  Whoa.  And by that, I mean shitter poking.  Oh, is she lovely.  I thought you meant something like that.  Hey, let's say hi to Big A. 
[03:01:00]  Mr. A of the big variety, how are you?  Hi, Opie.  Hey, Anthony.  Hi.  Hey, little Jimmy.  How about this, Andrew.  Just from now on, go, hey, everyone.  Okay.  Just faster.  Hi, everyone.  So when was the surgery?  Two days ago?  No, yesterday.  Yesterday, okay.  And for the people that don't know, Big A had some kind of neck pain or something and discovered it was a tumor, right?  Yes.  But we learned it was a B9 tumor. 
[03:01:30]  B9.  That's one of the better tumors to get, obviously.  Of course.  Yes.  You don't want the M7.  That's horrible.  He got the B9.  Yeah, he got a B9.  What happened?  What did the doctors do?  What did they say?  Walk us through it.  Actually, I haven't received my surgery yet, but they made a incision and took out the tumor, and I haven't heard anything else. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, my God.  Your hearing's gone?  No.  No, no, no, no.  I like that one, Ed.  That's cute.  Did you cut any of the cable off?  No, you didn't hit any major cables running through that neck of yours?  No.  Good.  I heard it was near the salivary glands. 
[03:02:30]  The salivary gland?  Ben, could you have had a salivary gland tumor?  I thought he was going to say it was near the silent lucidity.  Did you get to save the tumor?  No, I couldn't, no.  Oh, why not?  Could have brought that in, have someone eat it.  You don't know good radio.  Imagine someone eating Big A's tumor. 
[03:03:00]  That'd be great.  So, Big A, you feel okay?  How was recovery?  Recovery was good.  I was recovery too, oh, too damn long.  I didn't, I didn't get it, the bed until 1245.  Mm-hmm.  Please get a job working for, like, Microsoft or something in customer service,  helping people fix their computers.  How beautiful would it be to hear this voice when you call up with a problem? 
[03:03:30]  Is it on, did you hit, is it, did you have to hit, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, ss, 
[03:04:00]  Now Jimmy's interested in the movie.  I certainly am, my friend.  What do you think so far?  It's a great read.  Oh, thank you.  Very interesting.  What's your favorite part so far?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, he hasn't read a page.  No, no, I have him.  I think I hear him rifling through the book right now. 
[03:04:30]  Of course, he's just trying to find a chap that he can say.  His part was by Las Vegas.  What?  Las Vegas.  It could have been your favorite.  Is that your machines going off in the background?  You all right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I want to hear a bunch of beeps turn into a steady, long, steady tone.  The answer to the noise then giggles.  Yeah, that's why.  He's all right. 
[03:05:00]  When are you getting out of there?  Yeah.  Um, I don't know.  Ooh, it sounds like you just got excited by that question.  Anyone else here in the beeps going?  So you're okay, eh?  No, no, no.  I'm doing great.  I have no pain.  I'm doing great.  All right, cool.  When are we going to be able to see you again?  Um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, maybe a couple of weeks or maybe, I don't know yet.  All right.  Did the doctor tell you what you did to get that or what you shouldn't be doing? 
[03:05:30]  anything like that  not yet  I haven't seen  Doc yet so once I see him  I'll definitely ask him  Big Egg I want to hear the machines  get the phone near the machines  then we'll ask him questions  and what meter is  what machine is that 
[03:06:00]  is it your heart  actually  every time  I move my arm  on the fluid tube  it beats  I was going to ask you questions  but we needed you hooked up to some kind of heart monitor  it's probably actually the scale that he's on  I like the mouth  but then the heart monitor  and had that kind of problem 
[03:06:30]  any nurses washing you  not yet no  they are but they're wearing masks  like when they wash the Holland Tunnel  there's a non-potable water tank in there  big huge elephant brushes  what about drugs  how are the drugs  not bad  I don't have much pain

[03:16:30]  I like that guy  you're the  tell people  where to go  girl  and I was like  who is that  talking to  Iraq and realized  how stupid  some people can be  and it's a step  up  so Iraq got  involved with  this matchmaking  he really didn't  get involved  he just pretty  much said  that's Pat  and I was like  oh okay  Eric knows how  to make it happen  Pat kept talking  about her  and he kept  going on  should I ask  her  I got tired  of it  so I just  took him  and I walked  there and he's  like he likes  you  and then I left  what the fuck  are we in  fifth grade  he likes you 
[03:17:00]  he really  really likes you  look at that  fucking  look at the hat  how do you expect  him to introduce  a guy  responsibly  here  now a very  important question  I have to ask you  do you know  a lot about  Pat  I think so  do you know  about his  relationship  with this  program  here and there  here and there  do you know  how he got  his job  with this show  yes  oh you do  okay  of course  the baby bird  that's all  I wanted to know  at Jones Beach  I was sitting  next to him 
[03:17:30]  oh okay  and what did he do  just like try to  distract you  the whole time  it was on  like you know  pointing at something  else  I'm not squeamish  like that  what a good girl  it's cool  oh nice  no problem  watching him  get puked  all over his face  that was kind of  funny  it was funny  yeah  and what do you  think about his  Amish beard  I think it's him  you know  it's a little crazy  but it's cool  I think it's  you can't wait  you can't wait for him  to shave it  no  I didn't say that  but no  you can't  what's he like  away from all this  what's he like  as a person 
[03:18:00]  is he crazy  is he violent  is he nice  he's the same  as he is  any time  he really doesn't  change  boring  a little bit  no I'm kidding  no  I know you know  oh he just made  a very straight face  is he packing  yes  wow  she didn't even  hesitate  wow  look at Pat  with a high five  nice  that kid's all  cock  yes  she did not  hesitate  she's like  yes  yes  yes  yes  yes 
[03:18:30]  Alan Alden  wow  she was waiting  for that question  so Pat's a big boy  yes  budding romance  how long  does he get  the job done  um  I get the job done  I think  yes  oh boy  wait a minute  that means  hold on  after Pat  while they're kissing  I don't know what I'm allowed to say  and what I'm not allowed to say  while they're kissing  you can say whatever you want  Pat will make comesies in his pants  after kissing  in my mouth  oh  alright  that's nice 
[03:19:00]  yeah  fuck  why not  alright look  hold on a second  some stuff  we were trying to be nice and polite here  she's great  we were in polite mode  but fuck that  CBS  forget it  alright  wait so  Jimmy why don't you take this  is the whole staff as open minded as you are  I had no idea  we worked in this mecca  we would have said hi a long time ago  oh fucking great  so um  sorry Pat  don't worry about it  a nice swallowing girl  yes  oh that's nice 
[03:19:30]  and you can accept all of the huge Pat Duffy cock  yes  Pat talk dirty in bed  is he a dirty talker  um  yes  okay  oh my god  wow  in front of his friends  what  I do it back  even trade  like what will you  like what will he say to you  something he'll say to you  no fine I don't care  whatever  yeah he don't care  no Pat Duffy's pretty open  don't be a scared  don't be a scared  you say it  no by all means  it's all you  go for it  Pat  don't be a scared of him 
[03:20:00]  Pat good  I like to say um  is that what you wanted  after what  you bring her a bowl of fruit  exactly  is that what you wanted  yeah we need  the line needs a set up  yeah what  what do you do before you say  is that what you wanted  well for example  uh  we were uh  fucking around in her car  recently  yeah  and um  she  and then she saw a guy  walking into an apartment  and you know  is that what you wanted  a boyfriend with a home  no and uh 
[03:20:30]  she um  she actually had to uh  she got so excited  she had to pull off  into a parking lot  and give me oral treats  oh  and as soon as she went  down on me  I was like  is that what you wanted  fair enough  that's good  that's good  alright  I thought that was a hack  I wanted first  but if she couldn't  help herself but to do it  fucking Pat kind of had to  is he more dominant  he seemed like  he'd be more dominant  that's kind of a silly  question though  is that what you wanted  we pulled over  she pulls out  oh fuck I'm blowing you  no I wanted something  out of the glove box  what do you think 
[03:21:00]  so what was her line  um  pretty much yeah  I had a mouthful  I really couldn't talk  yeah  nice  Pat will say  but that's not really dirty  is that what you wanted  that's kind of like  redundant  like rhetorical  in a way  we gotta interrupt this  we got a big star  oh we got Michael Moore  don't go anywhere  wait Matt the intern  I thought it was Michael Moore  what the F  who is this  Matt the intern  what's up  uh I want to ask Pat  about the uh  the love note drawings  he does for  the stick figures 
[03:21:30]  oh stick figure love note drawings  oh wow  he has no headphones  you put headphones on  you do stick figure love note drawings  I do  oh no  I uh  I like to live  I get here much earlier  than she does  so I like to live uh  little things on her desk  you like to live little things  leave little things  alright now we got the real  Michael Moore calling in  yeah  oh you're  you've been saved  wait for a few minutes  yeah we will definitely  get back to you  okay  alright thank you guys  uh Michael Moore  hey  hi Michael 
[03:22:00]  there he is  hey why did you start  with that hey  we're very energetic  here Michael  look how  let me explain  what's going on  because he's been beating up  on uh CNN  yeah Michael  he's a little tired  you're talking to Opie and Anthony  we met uh back  you're exhausted  uh we met back in the day  and I know what's going on  it kind of wears you out  yeah well this is probably  your 20th interview of the day  and you're just like  at least  hey man  no no no  at least I can sleep  I said I would only do two this morning  oh really  oh okay  yeah I said it had to be you guys  and uh the Tom Joyner show 
[03:22:30]  you know Tom Joyner  yes  of course  yeah  Michael uh  saw Sicko  it was great  and uh  believe me  uh uh  I am not uh  probably not on the same  uh wavelength  as you are politically  uh I'm not uh  one of those loony  crazy right wing  um uh Republicans  but uh  I think our ideology  uh probably  parts ways  when it comes to  a lot of socialized  uh programs  and uh  uh  a lot of your subject matter  in Sicko  but I think it was a great movie 
[03:23:00]  you did a very good job  of um  showing what's going on  in this country  as far as the uh  medical profession goes  well  congrats  and uh  actually I made it  for guys like you  um  who don't necessarily  agree with me  um  and I  well you saw it  so you can see  that it's a different movie  than uh  than the last one  I've liked all your movies  though  I gotta  gotta be honest with you  it's uh  even when I completely  disagree  I'm like  Jesus Christ  this son of a bitch  he knows how to make a movie  but yeah  I sit there  and you know  I 
[03:23:30]  I  there are some things  I agree with  some things I don't  some things I think  maybe  maybe you're  cause here  I like your narrative  uh  there'll be nice music  playing on a fun part  where  where things are  supposed to be light  and uh  Michael will talk  like uh  and we went into  this guy's office  and he didn't want to  talk or he's saying  this  and then  when something very  very sensitive  is going on  we brought these  soldiers into the  hospital  your voice changes  and I'm like  god damn you  he knows how to work it  you can work it  do you do that 
[03:24:00]  consciously  I wish I was that  talented  when you're  narrating  you make it sound like  I actually know  what I'm doing  it's like I know  to be sad now  because Michael's  voice got sad  Michael uh  this is Jim Norton  nothing  I was hoping  to be recognized  my name  um  and I  I like  I like  a sicko  very much  it really is  what was the most  despicable thing  you think that you  found  I mean  it's really hard  for anyone to  defend the insurance  companies  somebody made this 
[03:24:30]  point to me  is this correct  or not  because I'm not  as well versed  on it  I was talking  about well  the HMOs  kind of suck  and he was saying  that what really  pushed the HMOs  through was trying  to get socialized  medicine and Hillary  Clinton  are what made  them as powerful  as they are  is that complete  nonsense  well what  they really got  their start  with Nixon  because he  I have these  secret Nixon  tapes that  nobody's heard  and I put them  in the movie  and you get  to hear how  Nixon and his  the Karl Rove 
[03:25:00]  of his time  this guy  named John  Ehrlichman  sat around  in the Oval  Office  trying to  figure out  a system  where  insurance  companies  and doctors  would provide  less care  so that the  insurance companies  would make  more profits  and how would  that benefit  the president  and why  would he be  interested in  doing that  they were  among his  main contributors  and they  wanted to  happen  and they  had come  into the  Oval Office  and met  with them  saying look  we've got  this great 
[03:25:30]  scheme  cooked up  the insurance  companies did  where  we're going  to rig the  system where  doctors do  as little  as possible  so that we  don't have to  pay out  very much  money  which will  increase  our profits  and it  worked  and the  whole country  fell for it  too  I mean  everybody  said oh yeah  HMOs  manage care  this is a good  idea  we'll be smart  about it  and we won't  go to the  doctor for  everything  and blah blah  blah  and what  it ended up  with a system  here as I  show in the 
[03:26:00]  movie  the case  like with  one woman  who she  goes in  for an  operation  and it  ends up  costing too  much money  and the  insurance  company  goes we  don't want  to pay  this bill  this is  too much  money  so they  send an  investigator  try and find  something in  her past  where we  can claim  that she  didn't tell  us  that she  had  she had  a yeast  infection  years ago  and because  of that  they dumped  her  off the  rolls  and tried  to get  their money  back from  the doctor  from the 
[03:26:30]  operation  you're a  great visualizer  just as a  filmmaker  you really  have this  brilliant way  of putting  and again  whether I  agree or  disagree with  certain points  like when  you brought  the Columbine  I think it  was kids  into Kmart  that was  just such  a brilliant  couple of  things to  have  you're great  at having  things collide  like visual  images collide  on film  to make a  point  it's really  something you're  great at  well thank you  for saying that  I really enjoy 
[03:27:00]  doing this  and I think  film is a  great way  to tell a  story  and that's  what I try  to do  and I try  to make  movies  that appeal  to  I come  from Flint  Michigan  and you  don't really  go to many  documentaries  in a place  like that  and I never  did and I  never really  liked them  I always  thought they  were pretty  boring  and I  thought maybe  there's a  different way  to do this  it will make  it a lot  more entertaining  because it's  Friday night 
[03:27:30]  you're going  out on a date  or you're  taking your  wife out  or whatever  and you  don't say  hey honey  let's go see  that healthcare  documentary  it's like  you worked  hard all week  and especially  if it's a date  you're sitting  there during  the movie  thinking about  what's going  to happen  after the movie  you don't want  to be having  the buzz kill  of going to  see a documentary  that's just  going to ruin  the night  there's been  critical stuff  obviously about  you like  there's a  website  Michael Moore's 
[03:28:00]  Lies or  something like  that  there's dozens  of websites  oh yeah  the question  I have  and again  I don't know  if this is true  or not  and Roger  and me  I thought  was great  you kept  going to  Roger's  country club  to ask  if you could  speak to him  and he was  continually  saying no  I've been  told  and may be  wrong  was that  not his  country club  at all  that you  were going  to  yeah  no it  wasn't  that's right  in the film  I go there  and they  say he's  not here  you're in  the wrong  place  so then we 
[03:28:30]  go to  another  place  I mean  that's  right  when people  make up  stuff like  that  they hope  that people  haven't seen  the movie  or forgotten  it  like I read  this thing  recently  where they  said  he actually  talked to  Roger Smith  you know  and I'm  thinking  yeah  it's in  the movie  at the  end of  the movie  I bust  into his  Christmas  party  and have  a brief  interview  with him  so you  know you  just you  read this  stuff and  you realize  look I  understand  why they've 
[03:29:00]  got to go  after me  you know I've  been you know  somewhat successful  in getting my  message out to a  lot of people  it doesn't just  preach to the  choir it reaches  across wide deep  into mainstream  America and that  makes it frightening  to them and so  you know they  go after me and  I accept that I  understand why  they do that  but on this  issue with  health care it's  like everybody's  got a story to  tell how they've  been screwed  over you know  by their  insurance company  by a doctor  by a hospital  by something 
[03:29:30]  you know you  know the people  can you know how  many times have  you had to wait  in an emergency  room for God  knows how many  hours I mean  you know everybody's  got some story to  tell everyone's been  affected by this  so going after  me on this I  don't know what  to do because  people sitting at  home are going  yeah you know I  can tell you a  story I'm sure  do you have an  answer sitting there  can tell a story  you know do you  do you have like  an answer to this  what would work  because I saw  obviously Canada  has socialized 
[03:30:00]  medicine and there  were just fantastic  stories coming out  of Canada in your  movie but I  honestly cannot see  the country with  the way we are  we're different  people than  Canada obviously  I cannot see  this country the  way we are  accepting some  kind of huge  socialized program  like that you'd  have a very small  minority of people  the rich paying  for a very large  majority the poor  trying to get 
[03:30:30]  health care and  probably maybe not  being very honest  or up you know  upright about it  and I don't think  we're the type of  people that can  handle that just  as the communists  when the Iron  Curtain came down  weren't really that  hip on democracy  and figuring that  out I think there's  there's too many  people that that  would take advantage  on the backs of  too few of the  people that are  actually a foot in  the bill I know  we don't we don't  trust ourselves very 
[03:31:00]  well do we no we  really don't they  don't in those other  countries they don't  think like that they  don't think somebody's  going to scam the  system here you know  what what they do is  they say well you  know what a small  percentage will always  try to scam the  system but the  majority of people  aren't that way the  majority of people  actually are honest  and good people and  and they'll they'll  behave properly and  I was always wondering  where that like during  your movie I'm just  going okay but where  the where is the  money coming from  where is all this  money coming from  all the money that the 
[03:31:30]  money parts the easy  part if we if we  switched to a universal  health care national  insurance plan right  now it costs it costs  us the consumers close  to four hundred billion  dollars a year in  administrative costs for  these private insurance  companies not to mention  the profits that they  have to make so they  have to build that into  it all of that would be  eliminated it would  actually cost us less  that's why in Canada you  know if we spend like  around seven thousand  dollars a person here in 
[03:32:00]  health care each year  Canada Britain France  these these other  countries you know  spend around three  thousand dollars less  than half of what we  spend and yet they all  live longer than we do  and in fact they don't  have to wait to see a  doctor in Britain in  France and some of  these other countries  the way we have to  wait you can call a  doctor in say Germany  or Britain and you can  see a doctor that day  or the next day and  that happens about 70%  of the time well you 
[03:32:30]  brought up a good  point there about  people living longer  in some of these  countries we we as  Americans live an awful  lifestyle there are  some very unhealthy  people here just  because of the the way  we live and eat and  these you know fast  food restaurants I got  to say Michael you're  not the picture of  health yourself as far  as your weight goes  and there's there's an  epidemic of obesity in  this country that I  think would be would  would cost a lot of 
[03:33:00]  money to take care of  yeah two-thirds of the  country is overweight  it's it's it's a big  problem part part of  why they don't have  this problem as much in  these other countries is  because they really focus  a lot on preventive  measures preventive  medicine they talk a lot  about nutrition they  start that right in the  schools and you're not  going to go to a school  in Britain or France  and find a coke machine  like right in the in  this country and so 
[03:33:30]  you've got kids you  know fourth graders  fifth graders you know  in this country going to  the pop machine soda  machine and drinking  cokes during the day and  it starts there and it's  a very bad place to be a  very bad situation don't  you see that though as  don't you see that though  as being like there seems  to be this huge outreaching  spider web of of what our  country is about that  affects the health care in  this country and and  that's why I don't think  socialized medicine can 
[03:34:00]  really work until we fix  all that other stuff  because it's just we're in  such a mess as far as  the health of this  country goes that I  really think there's a  problem having the  taxpayers foot the bill on  this one well I think you  make an excellent point and  in fact I tried to say  that in the film that  that ultimately just  having universal health  care isn't going to fix  the bigger problem that we  have and I think one of  the bigger problems we 
[03:34:30]  have is that as I say in  the film that that we we  live in this me society  it's all about me I got to  get mine you get yours I  get mine every man for  himself pull yourself up by  your bootstraps and the  other kind of these other  countries these other  western industrialized  countries it's about we  and you know it's it's  they they structure  themselves differently  they they don't feel  good if too many people  fall between the cracks  our attitude is hey 
[03:35:00]  buddy you know sorry I  got my problems I got my  problems you got yours  you fix yours I'll fix  mine yeah but we're not  going to be able to change  that anytime soon that's  yeah it's such a it's it's  just again if we start  thinking differently  though if we just start  treating each other and  that's why I show in the  film I reach out in the  movie to this guy who's  got this anti-Michael Moore  website you know he's a  right right that was a  great part by the way and  he yeah and he he you know  his wife he can't afford 
[03:35:30]  her medical bills and and  she's got serious problems  and I thought to myself you  know he said he's gonna  have to shut his website  down attacking me and I  just thought well geez that  that isn't right I mean why  should his first amendment  rights of free speech be  curtailed because he can't  afford his wife's medical  bills I don't know how  you've done that there  have been some message  board posts where I  actually want to go over  and kill his wife kids  family  that's horrible no no  that's I don't want them  anymore and I and I say  this to people I put that 
[03:36:00]  in the film to say to  people who are on my side  of the political fence look  we're not going to fix  anything in this country  until we reach across the  great divide that exists here  and find some common ground  we've got to start with this  attitude we're all Americans  we're all in the same boat  we're going to it's worse  now than ever we live in a  crazy world right now how  can we how can we survive in  this world with you know  you know terrorist attacks and  the other things that you know  that that have occurred that  may occur again if we don't 
[03:36:30]  all say hey man we are all in  this together we can have our  political differences but damn  it you know that we can't we  can't be messing around like  this what was his reaction  Michael when you because that  was a great part where this  guy is attacking you and you  actually anonymously I don't  know if you just said that but  you anonymously paid to have  some of the things taken care  of so the website kept up and  obviously he learned that since  since that's happened what is  his reaction been or has he  had I called him just before  the film came out to tell him  that it was me that sent the  twelve thousand dollar check for 
[03:37:00]  his wife's medical bills and  and because I didn't want him  sandbagged and blindsided by the  media calling him when the movie  came out I you know but when I  sent it to him a year ago at  the time I didn't tell him who  it was because I wanted him to  cash the check I didn't want  him to think that that came  from Michael Moore I'm not going  to cash the check but but I did  this as I mean look I was I was  raised in you know and with  certain basic values and one of  those values said that you're  actually you're to love your  enemy you're you're you're to do 
[03:37:30]  good to those who persecute you I  don't know you know if you guys  went to those churches or had  those nuns but you know that's  the way I was taught in and and  and and it was it was a hard  thing for me to do I didn't want  to give this guy twelve thousand  dollars of my money every day he  writes hateful stuff about me but I  thought well but you know he  shouldn't he should have the right  to do that in a free country and and  and not having health insurance  means his rights are taken away so 
[03:38:00]  suddenly we're not a free country  simply because his wife's sick that  made no sense to me I don't want to  live in that kind of country and I  want it to change and I'll may I'll  take the first step by saying  here's here's something I'll do for  someone who hates me now now can't  we all just figure out a way to to  structure ourselves differently and  take care of each other and not let  so many people in our society fall  between the cracks won't we be living  in a better world if we do that it  sounds great but I just don't have 
[03:38:30]  enough faith in in the government to  be able to pull something like that  off and make it work without it  turning into what the HMOs have  turned into right this did just  doesn't seem to be a way to make  this utopian society work I know what  you're saying about the government but  when we if we start to see the  government of buying for the people  mean that we actually control it and  if we actually showed up at the polls  and voted for people that are going to  do the job and if they don't do the 
[03:39:00]  job we vote them out of there you  know if we started doing our job as  citizens maybe the government would  be a little bit better there was a  time when the government actually did  things right I mean ask your parents  or your grandparents you know if  social security if their social  security check comes every month I  mean they love social security the  the check always comes on the same  day every month it's for the right  amount they never have any trouble  with it it's a big bureaucracy and  yet they they take care of tens of  millions of senior citizens every  single month and they do it well we 
[03:39:30]  put a man on the moon in eight years  president Kennedy said we're gonna put  a man on the moon by the end of the  decade and then we just did it you  know president Roosevelt said we're  gonna defeat the Nazis and the  Japanese and we did it we did it in  less time than it's taken us to  secure the road from the airport to  downtown Baghdad now that was a time  when we did things and the government  functioned well and it got the job  done why can't we go back to that  what is wrong with us that we can't  it just seems like now it's too you 
[03:40:00]  know it's too big teams and they're  against each other all the time never  never working together to get anything  done and that's that's what we've  gotten into and they're the names you  got you got the big names and they're  the only ones that can run and the  only ones that could realistically be  elected and people just have this apathy  that they you know I can't make a  difference I can't vote in an  independent and life goes on and and  things get worse and worse and we come 
[03:40:30]  become more and more divided well we've  got to find a way to change that and I'm  and I'm saying as one of the strong  voices from the left in this country  that I'm willing to find a way to fix  that because we're not going to make it  through the rest of the century it  divided like this we've got to come  together and we've got to find issues  where we can find some common ground  if health care can be one of them  great let's do that but you know I'll  do my part as one individual and if  everybody else can do that maybe I just  don't want to sink into this kind of 
[03:41:00]  the cynicism that says you know it's  all fucked you know forget it in the  end of it well Michael I think a point  to like you're right about Kennedy  getting the man on the moon and the  government working well I will say  though one of the problems securing the  airport road in Baghdad I know it's  just an example but I think it's a bit of  an unfair one because the military in  Iraq could dominate and absolutely do  whatever is necessary there the  problem is the public outcry for what  it would take to do that I mean if  they wanted that road secured and we're  allowed to do whatever it would take to 
[03:41:30]  secure that road I mean the road would  be secured the problem is that the  public is too involved now in all  military operations I well I think that  the problem is is that that the  commander-in-chief who's the top  essentially the top general how do you  feel you think Bush is a good  president you know I don't know if you  guys you know if you played football in  high school or whatever but the last  person you'd want as the quarterback of  the football team is the guy from the 
[03:42:00]  tennis team and that's what we've got  here we've got people who've never been  to war never really served in the  military never really and don't  understand what this is about and it's  scary when you think about it because  we do need a military to defend this  country and I think that we're not in a  very good shape or I'm very good shape  right now in terms of being able to  defend ourselves against what what the  real enemy may be yeah are you scared  that the president could have your food  poisoned no I think he's way too busy 
[03:42:30]  now trying to work his way out of a box  he must really want you out of the  picture though is I'm thinking I'm  thinking maybe they go old school and  get a little poison in your I think  they go into the White House screening  room and check out Michael's movies  and go hey look at this look at this  park here I come again hey Michael  before we let you go we played the  wolf blitzer confrontation earlier on  our show today it was just great  because we've been fucked by CNN and  the media ourselves with this whole  soundbite mentality they have and that's 
[03:43:00]  right it was great to have someone on  CNN really just blasting wolf blitzer  right to his face about the whole thing  you did smash it really well thank you  very much because you guys are a good  example of this of how you do things  that are extremely funny and also very  satirical in terms of really you poke the  pig is what you do with your humor and  and and so when you've done that in the  past instead of you know relaying the  whole context of what you've done you get 
[03:43:30]  seven seconds of it and it makes you  sound like you're you're straight self  and it it so I know you have been the  victims of that and you're not the only  ones a lot of people have and I and  ultimately then the public is them of it  and and and we should you know and the  only thing we do is we bring our  experiences this just to tell people I  listen our show I'm we yell and scream I'm  telling you they're getting the facts  wrong about what happened to us so can 
[03:44:00]  you imagine what else they're doing to  to the American people with their with  their quote news you know well I thought  the first time it happened to me I  thought jeez I don't think I can  believe anything I hear again because  now I've seen how it happens I've had  this this peek behind the curtain that  the public doesn't have and now when  they're amazing things I just I don't  believe anything in fact and I tell  people when it comes to me don't  believe a thing you hear about me or  read about me unless you hear out of  my mouth myself or see me do it do not  believe it even if it's good stuff 
[03:44:30]  about me don't believe it just don't  believe it I have to know this is Jim  Norton again from Lucky Louie yeah we  know nothing still okay got a book out  happy endings what what did the guy say  when you called him to tell him that  you were the one who had sent the  check you didn't want him sandbagged but  when you told him is that site still up  is he still attacking you as hard like  what was his reaction just as a man when  you called him he put a thing up on his  website about 15 minutes later thanking  me and wishing the film well and you 
[03:45:00]  know everybody told me you know when  you call him he is gonna be so mad he  is gonna rip you another one and I said  no I don't think so I think he's gonna  appreciate the fact that this came from  the heart and I did this because I  believe in it and that's that's how he  responded and and yes his website's still  going and yes he still goes after me and  and that's the way it should be in a  free country absolutely man all right  well thank you uh the film really was  great and again I haven't agreed with  everything you've done either point 
[03:45:30]  wise but it's like I can't not say that  this was really really interesting and  there's no way to defend the insurance  companies uh it really was great man I  enjoyed I enjoyed thank you guys thank  you so much for what you do thanks  Michael okay bye-bye there goes  Michael Moore yeah go check out sicko  for yourself yeah I mean there you go  check it out for yourself it's good there  there are plenty of things I don't agree  with him on but then there you know  there's other things makes you think  other things you know he's trying to I  think he also understands that the more 
[03:46:00]  controversy he makes with his films the  more people are going to see his films  he's a filmmaker all right he's not just  this crusader that runs around trying  to get the change done he's a  filmmaker and when you're a filmmaker you  want people to see your films we found  in so he found a great way to get  people to watch his films everyone has  been this controversial thing that went  when he announces his next movie the  second he announces the subject of his  movie there are people bashing it  they're talking about it right up until  it comes out and and past that which you 
[03:46:30]  know that's a talent in itself we're  getting a lot of phone calls all of us  yeah that means something's wrong why  what was yours I don't know was yours a  I don't know what area code yours was  what was yours I don't know I got a  voicemail it's easy to check on the  iPhone 202 let's hope not no it's a  516 oh wow that's Buffalo yeah no it's  what's in Buffalo it's a Long Island  thing book signing let's go to Matt in  Virginia Matt 
[03:47:00]  first of all it was a great interview  you know I really you know after seeing  that at Fahrenheit 9-11 I kind of had a  sour taste in my mouth about Michael  Moore and you know I had really no  reason to like him but you know after  that interview he really came off as  you know just a regular guy he just  wants to do what he can to help you  know you hear so much of this right  wing bashing of him you really kind of  buy into it and you know it's just good  to hear him talk like a regular guy with  people like you guys who are going to  really you know tell it how it is and  not hold punches and and not only talk 
[03:47:30]  the right wing talk I mean it was just a  great interview and it's someone on  instant feedback they go they go time to  put on your knee pads boys I don't think  that was going on at all to be honest  the first three minutes I thought it was  going to go that way and then you know  Anthony when he started getting into  you know just the social programs I  think it really turned around and  that's when you guys really got  comfortable with being able to let him  know how you felt you know so I mean  overall it was an amazing interview  guys that's all I got thank you man 
[03:48:00]  thank you yeah I mean you're not gonna  here's what you do you can't get on  there and just bash bash bash bash and  have him fight back and that you know  that's that's entertaining and stuff  but it wouldn't be honest it's not on  it or go against everything he says I'm  not a liberal it's the last thing I am I  hate liberals but there are some ideas  that they have and that Michael Moore has  that I think like wow they're at least  at the very least you got to say  thought-provoking you know to where you  want to go out and learn more about that 
[03:48:30]  subject and what's going on it's these  people on both sides the liberal and  and conservative side that just blindly  follow what their leaders tell them and  will never even listen to the other side  to then maybe want to look into it  further that's how you learn things  you can you could just say oh whatever  that person says is bullshit well check  the facts look it up it's readily  available everywhere and do that and  what I got to say about Michael Moore the 
[03:49:00]  guy does put out some thought-provoking  stuff some of it I've written off as  complete bullshit and emotional and stuff  but I did like what he said about just do  for other people at this point in this  country the way we are like I said I  don't think a socialized medicine works  because this country isn't that hip on  socialism we're so entrenched in  capitalism and making the best of  ourselves and getting ourselves to the  top of the pyramid and and that in this  country the example of that is being  successful wealthy whatever you want to 
[03:49:30]  call it other people have other ideas  happiness this that the other thing the  the quintessential success symbol in this  country right now is the dollar period  I want to hear from anyone else that  that's not the way it's portrayed it is  until that changes socialism in any real  way isn't going to work in this country  we aren't built for it we aren't set up  we haven't been trained for it as  Americans Americans are very independent  people that's why he was saying people 
[03:50:00]  you know don't fall through the cracks in  a lot of these other countries we're an  independent people we like our freedom  we like it independently and as far as  charity giving goes I'm a lot like he is  I'll say that as far as I give to people  I know that need stuff or to people like  like I'll read something in the paper  that'll be horrific and I'll find the  address and I'll send a check so some  pudding-head little girl could get her  wheelchair back you know her van right 
[03:50:30]  the van in the wheelchair was stolen but  there's things like that that kind of  he's in cahoots with Marge from the  little shelter little shelter I yeah you  know you have donated to the little  shelter we and we don't ruin it and we  beat her up every time she calls don't  read it there are certain things I do on  my own I don't like the idea of being  forced into this socialized government  program which amounts to more taxes I 
[03:51:00]  pay enough taxes I pay taxes up the ass  to keep the country rolling that's fine  but to then come up with these  socialized programs that are supposed to  help let the people in your communities  that have you know made something of  themselves and attain some type of  American dream help out and if that  happens then people are getting fixed  they're getting healthy they're they're  doing better and and you don't need this 
[03:51:30]  government involvement in in your  medicine I think you got to start your  political talk show oh you think that's  what I ought to do yeah you're done with  dick jokes  John and Philly what's up hey guys  what's happening  you guys know I hope Ben Kingsley heard  that because you guys get better  interviews than CNN or any of them  stupid news shows looks like I always  said it's like I always said Ben Kingsley  is a bit of a cunt fuck Ben Kingsley and  his fuck hole that's wow an Oscar winner 
[03:52:00]  absolute take that fucking Oscar and  shove it up his ass shove it up his ass  thank you John you know because that that  put on a hat that says Gandhi and pay  someone a shit in your face what do you  think of them apples BK we we we get a  horrific reputation but if if a guest  comes on our show and is gonna be  interesting and thought-provoking we we  can do a very good job but if a guest  comes in here and calls it in we're  gonna call him out on it right these  publicists and these people out there  that are booking you know guests for 
[03:52:30]  shows they just don't understand that  we really do a great job for their  people what opie means is the Jews  but seriously man Ben Kingsley found out  you know who we were and said fuck it  instead of why not come in here and  challenge us yeah we'll challenge you  let's go I'll have some fun probably be  very nice to him I was gonna say come  in my first question would have been  mr. Kingsley you won the Oscar what's  with this fucking knighthood shit who  the fuck are you where's your suit of 
[03:53:00]  armor night all right so are we gonna  start the precedent Steve donations of  money to our enemies oh oh I had a good  question too for no you didn't I  certainly didn't know you didn't because  he won the Oscar of all the female  Ben yeah co-stars you have worked with  mm-hmm who's kind most smelled like  garbage juice mr. Kingsley I say now 
[03:53:30]  that's probably a question I won't say  definitely but probably a question he's  never been asked if he has been please  send me the his answer all right all  right oh look at the time yeah well we  gotta get Jimmy on a choo-choo I got a  piss I got a call Sarah and no name in  San Francisco at 1130 and then I gotta go  you're going on a choo-choo train it's

[03:56:00]  inside I was trying to I was trying to get  it in there for you that is true and one  of the points I was trying to get to is  the fact that he Michael Moore is one of  the reasons like that the socialized  medicine thing could be a problem in  this country because we're kind of built  awful there's this country is just full  of obese people who would need tons of  medical care because it's all based also  on preventative care and tons and  preventative medicine so we're beyond the
