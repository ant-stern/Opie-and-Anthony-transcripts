<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Larry King's introduction, followed by Opie and Anthony's characteristically playful banter, including jokes about show titles incorporating Jim Norton's name.  They discussed a scheduled guest appearance by Shane from *The Walking Dead*, ultimately cancelled due to Opie's conflicting schedule.  Other potential guests, including Amy Schumer and Will Ferrell, were mentioned, setting a tone of unpredictability. Robert Kelly's weight loss attempts were subject to good-natured mockery, leading to a discussion about Eric's planned elliptical purchase and a digression about Pat from *Munakiâ€™s Cribs* and his unused gym equipment, punctuated by repeated "womp womp" sound effects.

The conversation shifted to *The Walking Dead*, including spoilers about Dale's death, provoking strong reactions from the hosts.  A substantial segment focused on augmented reality and the "String" app, exploring its potential uses in advertising and other fields, including interactive displays and heads-up displays in cars.  The hosts also discussed the ethical implications, including privacy concerns, the potential for misuse (like scanning tattoos containing sensitive information), and the possibility of constant internal health monitoring.  They speculated on a future where thoughts and emotions could be read through technology, raising societal and privacy implications.

The show then moved to a discussion of Joseph Kony and the Invisible Children campaign, analyzing its effectiveness and questioning the organization's motives.  They commented on a video interview with Kony, focusing on his appearance and demeanor, as well as that of his guards.  The attire and appearance of Kony and his associates were discussed.

A subsequent segment started with a humorous anecdote about reenacting Star Wars scenes, which transitioned into a darkly comedic comparison of a New York Times reporter entertaining the Taliban with Beatles songs to what the hosts would do in a similar situation (involving explicit sexual acts).  The conversation included derogatory remarks about a Taliban leader, comparing his appearance to various TV characters, and graphic descriptions of the Taliban's brutality.  The hosts' reluctance to sign online petitions due to past political blacklisting was also mentioned.  A significant portion focused on the hosts' and guests' (Joe DeRosa, Bobby Kelly, and Jim Norton) weight and diets, featuring graphic descriptions of eating habits and gym experiences.  The discussion then veered to jailbreaking iPhones and crude jokes about sexually explicit content in contracts.  The final major topic was the possibility of societal collapse due to a lack of electricity, with anecdotes about past blackouts in New York City, including looting and violence, interspersed with offensive jokes.  The hosts also discussed survival strategies and weaponry.  Promotion of upcoming comedy shows was included.

Another segment was dominated by vulgar and graphic discussions of sex, featuring crude language, descriptions of sexual encounters, and anecdotes.  One host recounted childhood camping trips in the Mojave Desert, leading to further sexually explicit discussions.  The hosts also discussed Siri, a listener bracket contest for $1000, and a bizarre bit involving smelling a deodorant-treated testicle. A guest, referred to as "Iraq," participated in this segment.  The segment concluded with promotional information for the hosts' upcoming stand-up appearances.

A chaotic and vulgar segment followed, featuring Opie, Anthony, Dice, Chip, Valley Jim, and Dominic Lombardozzi (who joined later).  Topics included highly offensive opinions on Bill Maher and Sarah Palin, crude impressions, phone jailbreaking, a graphic discussion of a mall hostage situation, extremely vulgar commentary on menstruation and sex, discussions of *The Fly*, *Predator*, and *Your Friends and Neighbors*, offensive stereotypes about redheads, and a discussion with Lombardozzi about his roles in *The Wire* and *Breakout Kings*, including the emotional response of the cast to a character's death.

A final segment began with a vulgar anecdote about Mardi Gras in Baton Rouge, then shifted to the porn industry's relocation to Louisiana, including discussions of porn genres.  Unnamed actors shared experiences with auditions for *The Sopranos*, *Entourage*, and other shows, often with vulgar descriptions.  A critical review of "Lily Hammer" followed, and the broadcast concluded with a comedically bad rehearsal of a scene from *A Bronx Tale* by a staff member and Chaz Palminteri, promotion of upcoming shows, and discussion of a UFC event.  Bob Kelly and Joe DeRosa were in-studio guests, along with several unnamed actors.

The show's final excerpt featured Opie, Anthony, Bobby Kelly, and Sam Roberts, focusing on sexually explicit jokes and accusations about their sexual experiences and orientations.  Bobby Kelly's wrestling appearance was promoted, along with the hosts' podcast and stand-up shows.  A listener call-in segment offered tickets to the wrestling show.  The show concluded with excited announcements about Will Ferrell's upcoming appearance and a final burst of shouting.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, this is Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  You get it. The thing's out of control. Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard, you know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mouth?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to intro it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, you're good.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning. Good morning. Friday morning. Welcome aboard. Welcome aboard. Come on in. Come on in. Good morning. Good morning. 
[00:01:00]  Hi, everyone. Good morning.  Can we get that main headphone volume up a little?  Yeah.  Going.  Going.  There you go. That's good.  Down a little.  There we go.  All right.  Hi, everybody.  Hey, buddy. 
[00:01:30]  How you doing?  Hi, Ant.  Ah, Jimmy Norton.  What do we call this show?  Because Grim in the Morning is when it's Greg and Jim in the Morning.  Oh, that's Grim in the Morning?  And Morning Jam is Jim and Sam.  Oh, that's a good one.  Yeah.  What's Ant and Jim?  Let's see.  Uh, AIM.  Ah, AIM, I think, works.  And how about...  Alka Norton? 
[00:02:00]  I like that. That's smooth.  Rolls right off the tongue.  Like a fucking, like a bed bug.  Racist, racismy?  I'm so bummed.  I just, we got that guy from the show coming in.  Shane, Shane from The Walking Dead is going to be coming in, um, when?  Tuesday?  Tuesday.  I'll be gone.  Fuck.  And?  Uh, Jimmy's not in.  I'm in L.A.  That's for that day.  That ruined my day.  I was so looking forward to talking to him. 
[00:02:30]  It's going to be, uh, what?  Me and Amy Schumer?  I think so.  Amy Schumer.  Is she a fan of The Walking Dead?  I sure hope so.  She's here Monday, right?  Oh, is she here Monday?  I don't know.  No, Will Ferrell's here Monday, right?  Yeah, Amy's supposed to be here Monday, too.  I have no idea when these guests come in.  It's like a surprise, though.  I sit my ass down, we start doing the show, and it's like, hey, look who's here.  Yeah, Roland said it was very easy to book guests for today and next week because he  came in today, and I'm working on some comedians for the show, and you said, yeah, all right,  whatever.  I don't care. 
[00:03:00]  Bye.  Bye, I don't care.  It's their fucking privilege to be here.  That's what I say.  Yeah, Opie's on vacation.  Um, various people in for the vacationing Opie.  That's what they say on the news.  For the vacationing.  Um, so it's going to be, you know, me, Jimmy, and then various incarnations of people.  I believe today, Joseph of the DeRosa variety will be in.  And, um, is Bobby coming in also? 
[00:03:30]  Yes.  Robert Kelly, who, uh, we really have to just have an intervention at this point.  It's just not right what he's doing himself.  Has he stopped?  He told me he started going to the gym.  So did he, though.  That is true.  Yeah, no.  Point at the window.  Yes, of course.  Uh-huh.  Uh, boy.  It's E-Rock.  It is.  How are you doing on your points?  I don't feel like I'm losing any weight on my points.  Pertz.  I'm doing all right.  You don't feel like I'm doing all right?  I'm still under on my daily intake.  Me too.  I'm doing all right.  Didn't you just start? 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I restarted last Friday.  Oh, okay.  But every day I've been under, so.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good for you.  I'm not going to bash him.  He's trying.  Oh, good one, Jimmy.  No, he's not.  No, he's not.  Well, I mean.  We've talked about this ad nauseum already, but, you know.  I wouldn't call what he's doing trying.  Really?  He's half-assing it.  That's all a diet is anyway.  It's trying to listen to.  Look at that.  See, it's a different meaning of the word trying. 
[00:04:30]  It's trying on us.  Yes.  Yes.  Very trying.  Yeah.  It's like you should try harder or something.  Oh, yeah.  It's not the meaning at all.  Oh, yeah.  Weight Watchers points.  It's not magic weight loss.  No.  No, you just eat better.  You eat, like, less.  Like, I find myself with portion control.  That's all I've been talking about is portion control.  Yeah, but you know what, Jimmy?  At least you'll go downstairs to your gym in your building.  Eric's just going to sit there and play video games.  Yeah.  I'm not shitting on him.  It's the truth.  I'm not saying anything that's not true.  You're just speaking the truth.  You rock? 
[00:05:00]  No, I'm getting stuff for my house soon.  I'm getting elliptical.  More video games.  Oh, God.  In elliptical for the house?  Yeah.  I would do that.  Where are you going to put it?  You can block the fridge.  In his seventh bedroom.  Yeah, we got extra bedrooms, so I'll just throw in one of there.  Just make an exercise room.  Yeah.  Go with the Nagel workout room.  Ah.  Yeah, but I've said this before.  Nagel fitness club.  I was just thinking that.  The Nagel mansion is going to have one room that has a couch, a television, every video  game console, and tons of DVDs. 
[00:05:30]  The most used room in the house?  And another room with an elliptical.  Which room do you think is going to be occupied?  It's going to be like Pat from Munaki's Cribs.  He had that back bedroom that was just filled with cobwebs and a weightlifting set.  Yeah, the weights were literally rusted.  They were rusted and the bar was resting on the bench, and there was like a permanent  dented line in it because it hadn't been moved in 12 years.  It hadn't been moved.  It's Pat a hoarder, though.  He used to wear it.  No, he's not a hoarder.  He doesn't have a lot.  He doesn't have enough to be a hoarder. 
[00:06:00]  No, he doesn't have enough to be a hoarder.  He doesn't have enough to be a hoarder, poor guy.  Oh, poor bastard.  Yeah.  He had a video up last night.  I guess he was doing some reading contest at the Devil's Game.  In Jersey.  And he had video of him up watching the game with a bunch of the Devil's cheerleaders  around, kind of around him.  Very close.  And you see these hot girls with the little pom-poms and little short skirts, and he was  showing them, and then he quickly just turns the camera on himself with that, ah, face. 
[00:06:30]  What the fuck is he doing?  How would he do that?  I don't know, but it's Pat, and he's endearing.  I like the Pat.  I like when he showed up to your house last time with a shirt that said, meh, meh, he's  got merch.  M-E-H.  Yeah.  Pat's got merch.  Meh.  Meh.  Merch.  I saw somebody spell the Ropers theme.  I've heard the, like, the...  Womp.  Womp, womp.  But I also, someone spelled it M-W.  Oh. 
[00:07:00]  Womp, womp, womp, womp.  Womp, womp, womp.  Wow.  It's a womp, womp.  Yeah.  I think it's womp, womp, womp, womp, womp, womp, womp.  Whatever it is, it's beautiful.  Womp, womp, womp.  Everyone loves this.  It's Friday.  Come on.  No, we're not going to stop playing it.  Why do people beg to have this stop playing when everyone knows how much they love it?  Somebody's waking up to this right now.  Ah, fuck.  The alarm goes off. 
[00:07:30]  They're like, no.  Wow.  Because it just gets ingrained in your noggin the entire time.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's gross.  I can literally listen to this for four hours.  Oh, yeah.  It's the greatest thing I've ever heard.  I think we have during this program.  There have been a couple of those days.  I don't think I've ever watched an episode of The Ropers, though.  I had.  I can't tell you what the hell the show is about. 
[00:08:00]  Hey, I'm so distracted thinking about missing Shane.  I can't tell you how fucking bummed I am that I'm missing that dude.  Because I like the show a lot.  Are you caught up totally?  Yes.  Is everybody caught up totally on Walking Dead?  Yeah, you?  I didn't watch the second or third season, but I read the book, so I know what happens.  Thank you, Bob.  It's, uh...  You watched?  You're caught up?  Let me see.  The last episode was, uh...  Um...  Judge, jury, and executioner.  Is that where, uh...  Oh, oh. 
[00:08:30]  Ah?  Ah?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Um...  Yeah.  Well, all right.  We'll see.  I've given you a spoiler on Walking Dead, so just...  You have fucking ten seconds to turn the radio off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  How happy were you that fucking Dale bought it?  I hated him.  I hate Dale.  Stupid fucking Dale.  Hated him.  It's like, hey, uh...  Zombie apocalypse.  There's no place for your fucking preaching.  What a douche. 
[00:09:00]  You can't kill him.  Oh, oh, oh.  We gotta do the right thing.  With his dumb face.  Yeah, his dumb eager eyes.  I wanted Shane to fucking knock his teeth out.  Yeah, I was very happy to see him disemboweled.  Oh, I've never been happier to see a character killed.  With that horrified, puzzled look on his face.  Yeah, yeah.  That's how we looked every time we took a stance.  And his dumb fucking hat.  His fucking...  That was one of the, uh...  On Golden Pond hats.  Oh, I hated it.  What a goody gumdrops. 
[00:09:30]  Minding everybody's business.  Yeah, he was always in everyone's shit.  Yeah.  Needs him.  And his dumb opinion.  Without spoiling it, I guess.  Where are they in the show?  Because I haven't been following.  Like, are they in the woods still?  Have they made it past that?  Just say they're in the woods.  No, they're not in the woods.  No, they're in...  Yes, they are.  They're in a farm.  Yeah, they're at the farm.  Okay.  That's all.  I got you.  And they're all eating oats and honey brand cereal.  And the old preacher came.  And they just found out he's making them shit sandwiches. 
[00:10:00]  And they help.  A barn full of fucking stupid monsters.  Monsters.  I like the fact that the...  Yeah, it's still spoiler alert and stuff.  If you're not caught up, the little girl was in there that they were looking for.  That was a great scene.  Yeah, that's a good one.  I kind of like that, that they didn't cop out on that one.  Not at all, man.  Like when they kill kids in TV shows.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  And Andrew Lincoln coming in is what made me watch that show because we had him in.  Yeah.  Who plays the...  What's the guy's...  How am I not known the name? 
[00:10:30]  Rick.  Rick.  Yeah.  Rick.  Rick.  With his dumb English accent.  And fucking...  The department here takes a photo of me with him.  And they can't find the picture they took.  Oh, I have no.  I have your picture.  I took a nice picture of him.  And they took one of...  So fucking irritated.  I don't understand you in pictures.  How are you going to do it with your camera?  I don't remember.  Why was I going to do it?  Because I really didn't know who he was.  It's very important.  And I just did because he was such a fun guest.  You had the video, right?  Yeah. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Can I kiss?  What...  Anything go on last night?  I didn't watch.  No, I mean just in your life.  Last night.  Nothing fun.  I was doing geeky stuff.  Oh, yeah?  I was like, yeah.  Computer stuff.  There's something going on.  And, you know...  I'm pretty geeky.  But I'm sure a lot of people know about this.  But the...  I guess the future of this looks pretty fucking cool.  Augmented reality. 
[00:11:30]  Dude, this is like...  I got this app last night.  And...  What the fuck is it called?  Here we go.  It's called String.  String!  And...  What you do is you get the app.  Then you go to their site.  And you print out these...  Just 8x10 paper.  And it's like a little...  Kind of artwork on it.  There's some type of artwork on it.  Then you lay the artwork on the floor. 
[00:12:00]  Put it on the wall.  Or something like that.  Then you fire up the app.  And it starts up your camera.  On your iPhone or smart cam.  Whatever the fuck.  A smartphone.  And then you go around.  And you're seeing your room.  Whatever it is that you got on camera.  And then when you finally reach that piece of paper.  And you put that in frame on your camera.  It comes to fucking life.  One I had was a brick wall with a hole in it.  And this little dragon peeks his head out.  And it just flies away.  And there's another one with this little pink fucking wobbly guy. 
[00:12:30]  And he kind of walks around.  And you touch the screen.  And the shit that's going to go on with this is like advertising.  You could be walking through a mall let's say.  And they have these symbols that are placed around the mall.  And all you have to do is put your camera on it.  And maybe a sneaker ad pops out of it.  And comes out like it's almost a three dimensional ad.  They're making shirts that do that now. 
[00:13:00]  Oh shit.  Where like you buy the shirt.  And then you shine it.  You put your camera on.  And you can have like an alien bust out of you.  Yeah whatever it is.  Oh man.  It's really fucked up.  It's pretty early on in it.  From what I saw in this app.  But that's really fucking cool though.  What do you think this app will turn into?  Like you know how when you talk about the computers from 10 years ago.  The video games you play.  Yeah.  And now you look at that like wow that was fucking ancient history.  Where do you think this will be in like 10 years?  I got to see it huge in advertising. 
[00:13:30]  But I could also see navigation.  It would kind of be pretty big in that.  I don't just see it being with smartphones either.  Let's say you're driving.  You got a little heads up display in your windshield.  And there's symbols on the side of the road.  They could then put something on your heads up display showing what's coming up at the next exit.  Shit like that.  Just like instead of passive signs on the road. 
[00:14:00]  It would be an active sign.  I don't think you'd have it too distracting.  Might be a bit much if it's very distracting to the driver.  You mean there won't be a dragon dancing across your windshield?  Yeah.  Just coming across.  Or make it look like people are walking across the street.  Just everyone's jamming on the brakes.  There's a dragon with a fucking.  With an Exxon hat going.  Da da da da da.  Pointing towards the exit.  People just skidding into the woods.  Wow.  That's cool, man.  Yeah. 
[00:14:30]  How about with glasses maybe.  Just to have them built into glasses instead of having the phone.  And this isn't way off science fiction.  I mean you could absolutely do this.  I think it's almost like They Live.  You know where you put the glasses on.  And all of a sudden you see all this weird fucking alien advertising.  But with that basic gist.  The idea of having glasses like Rowdy Roddy Piper had.  Oh, yeah.  And They Live.  And seeing other things than you would see without the glasses on. 
[00:15:00]  It's completely legit.  You know?  And it's.  I think it's pretty cool.  I was looking at it last night at home with that app.  And just going, wow, the future is pretty fucking badass.  And you got to print out the paper.  Yeah, that's like right now you have to print out the paper to get it in your house.  Because the paper is what lets the smartphone or whatever the fuck you're using.  Know that that's the actual thing that's going to come out based on what the print is. 
[00:15:30]  And it acts as a tracker for the animation that's incorporated in your video.  So you can move it as you're looking at it.  And let's say it is the dragon again.  And if you go to the left, you'll start seeing that side of the dragon.  Oh, that's cool.  It moves along with it.  It tracks perfectly with the video.  And the printing the paper is the part where, of course, in like two years, you'll be, remember you had to print the paper?  You had to print paper out.  Remember that shit?  Yeah, yeah.  When they do it on t-shirts then, does that mean that you actually, you can't just shine it on the computer with a picture of the t-shirt on it? 
[00:16:00]  It would have to be the shirt itself.  No, I tried that last night.  I put it on the computer and it works too.  Oh, okay.  With a picture on the computer.  How it does that is amazing.  It knows exactly how far over to each side you're moving it.  It's just really fucking cool.  I love new shit and the future.  And what's printed on the paper?  Just like, this was just like a crest, like a family crest kind of a thing. 
[00:16:30]  It could be any picture as long as, you know, the app identifies it as the picture that would go with a certain thing.  There was another thing, a sneaker ad.  And what you would do is you look through the camera, a sneaker pops up and you could look around the entire sneaker and change the colors of it.  It becomes interactive.  Like you could click and say, ah, I want the side of the sneaker to be red.  So you click on your phone on the side of the sneaker.  You could change the look of it.  And then you could, might be able to just order it on your phone at some point. 
[00:17:00]  Like that's why I'm thinking if you're walking through a mall and you go past a shoe store and point your camera at a sign in the shoe store and then a sneaker comes out, you could customize it and order it just like that on the spot.  It opens up a lot of shit for advertising and buying shit.  Now, can you imagine that, that kind of advertising technology combined with those 3D printers that Jeff Dunham was talking about?  Yeah.  That make everything.  Like, again, in 10 years or 12 years. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  When you'll be able to have this stuff, the material will be able to make it in your house.  Yeah, yeah.  For smaller items.  You'll be able to just fucking do that and press a button and order something into your living room.  Yeah.  There's shit coming out all the time that people go like, ah, I don't see any home application for that.  But when people said that in the future there'd be computers in every house, everyone thought, well, that sounds great, but there's no need for a computer in your house.  Like, no one really could figure out why you would need a computer in your house. 
[00:18:00]  All those futuristic things that they kind of told you about in the 70s movies and shit like that.  It's like, no, that never really was why you needed a computer in your house.  Right.  Because the whole thing of the internet and that wasn't even a â€“ you never even thought about that, like that these computers would be linked together.  You just thought you'd have a computer in your house and be like, now what do I do with it?  But the whole linking it together with other computers is what made it like, oh, now I could see because we could share information and commerce and stuff like that. 
[00:18:30]  I also like the idea of using the phone at airports.  You have your ticket on the phone now instead of a ticket and you just â€“ they scan your fucking phone.  Shit like that is what the future was supposed to be.  When they said also in the past â€“ I'm just remembering a lot of shit that was brought up years ago, moneyless, cashless commerce.  And it was like I could never imagine not having money on you because that's how you bought shit. 
[00:19:00]  And it's like, no, in the future you won't need money in your pocket.  You'll have a device.  And so it's like, what?  Get the fuck out of here.  What, a credit card?  No, not even a credit card.  A smart credit card.  What?  What about â€“ oh, fuck.  I forgot what I was going to say.  Whoopsie.  There's something about the scanning.  Yeah, at the movie theaters, they're scanning stuff now.  Yeah, now they scan at the movie theaters.  Fandango it and they email you a little barcode.  And you never have to put it on paper.  It's right there on your phone. 
[00:19:30]  I just do it to save the trees.  Is that why?  No, I'm a green guy.  I bet there are people, though, that are like, it's great because it's green.  People that are looking for another fucking cause.  I know.  It's green with envy.  Ah, Chip, that's always funny when Chip says it.  What is the name of the app?  That one was String.  How much is it?  It's free.  Yeah, they're just kind of â€“ I think they're kind of advertising and shit like that.  Oh, my God, a tattoo?  Kind of.  He got a QR code cleverly, like, kind of hidden â€“ not hidden, but in the tattoo. 
[00:20:00]  The tattoo.  Which then links to a video so he put his phone up against his tattoo and it looks like it's animated.  That's so fucking weird.  Dude, how about, like, people are tattooed in prison with something like that and then  when they're arrested, you just lay it on â€“ you lay it on their tattoo and all the  information for them comes up like that.  I was in Best Buy the other day.  I buy some stuff and they have QR codes on all the prices.  Because they have to use white ink.  So it's great. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  Because if you want to check out reviews or anything, like, you don't have to start going â€“ like,  go to bestbuy.com on your phone.  You just scan the thing.  It brings the product page right up and it's just easy.  I love doing that, too.  I feel like an asshole doing it still, but â€“  I think whenever you download one of those apps, one of those scanning apps, you just  go around scanning shit around your house.  Hey, look, it works.  What's the scanning app do?  Bottle of water.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  You just scan the UPC on stuff.  Now it's, like, more than just UPC.  Those QR codes are â€“ you know what I'm talking about, Jim, right? 
[00:21:00]  They look like squares of just â€“ it looks like static.  It looks like white noise.  Yeah.  Oh, I remember.  Yeah, they got, like, little blocks in them and stuff like that.  Yeah, and you scan those things.  They're using them â€“ yeah, they're using them a lot of stores now where you could â€“ you  scan â€“  Oh, yeah, sure.  You scan something like that.  Like I hear now, I think it's â€“ is it Macy's where you scan one of their codes  and P. Diddy can come up and tell you information about things?  That's what I want.  I want to know what P. Diddy knows about Macy's. 
[00:21:30]  Yee.  Look at that.  That's so fucking weird.  There's a little thing.  And what is that doing now?  Well, it's loading whatever it's linked to, but I don't know what it is, so it could be â€“  Oh, gay porn?  It could be a store.  It could be Meatspin.  Who the fuck knows?  Meatspin scan.  Each one of those is individually indifferent.  Yeah, yeah.  This is â€“  It's for a QR reader.  It's for a QR code maker.  Oh, okay.  Code maker.  I've seen those on billboards and shit like that too though where you could just fucking 
[00:22:00]  check them out on billboards.  It's really fucking amazing.  The iPhone can do a lot more than I fucking give it credit for.  Yeah.  The thing is it's changing every day.  You know, there's new shit coming out and the capability for the iPhone, it already  has shit built into it that I don't even think they knew about, you know?  People are kind of making shit up as they go along.  Do you know, I hate people who are just like regular guys.  Ah, what do I need to phone for?  Phone call?  Ah, just a regular guy.  I don't know about that scan. 
[00:22:30]  Ah, go ahead.  Scan your ass.  I'm a knock around guy.  A knock around guy.  Yeah, you know something?  That might be easy for the kids, but I like putting a little elbow grease in them, what  I do.  Yeah, what do I want?  Pictures jumping out at me?  I'm going to run into something?  Get out of here.  Give me the phone.  I'll make a call.  Give me my old regular phone and my house phone and a Polaroid camera and I'm set.  Really?  Are you?  I can't believe that.  That tattoo thing with the prison, you're right.  That's fucking information on people can just be right there and you can access it. 
[00:23:00]  It will just jump out and tell you what you need to know.  It can just be read like that.  How great would that be?  Why would a chick, you know, and all of a sudden the meaty pussy app jumps off and she  has fucking syphilis twice?  Yeah, medical records, shit like that.  It's funny because, you know, people have the, you know, in the 90s when it was cool  to have like a barcode tattoo.  Yeah.  I mean, look, now it's legit.  Now it's really, you could do that and it's viable.  It's really what it was meant to do. 
[00:23:30]  Have your information on there.  Uh, at the very least, some kind of a, um, uh, wristband or something that could be changed.  The tat might be, you know, say you don't have AIDS and then you have to get a new tat  when, well.  Yeah.  The old, the whoops-a-daisy addition to the tattoo, which is a frowny face that goes, well.  Well, not necessarily because, uh, the tat could just link to the, to the file, like  your file.  Oh, right.  I think they could change the information that the tattoo has in it.  The link, the link could stay the same.  Right.  You could, what the fuck am I thinking?  See? 
[00:24:00]  That's the shit.  You, you don't really think about, uh, the capability in that way.  But yeah, you change the information that goes along with the tat instead of changing  the tat for the information.  It's like people with one of those, uh, uh, the RF tags.  Right.  You know, that's just, that's just, it's not like you have to get a new RF tag if something  happens.  Yeah.  So if you, uh, let's say, yeah, let's, let's say you fucking, you, you go out with a girl  and, uh, you scan each other's, uh, tats and you see the date it was updated and make  sure they don't have the AIDS.  That will happen. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  I totally see that.  You have the online service that porn people use where it's called aim or something where  you could go check each other's HIV status immediately.  Like within a week, they do it.  You're right.  It will be fucked.  How about an employer with an employee coming in?  And you could check right away if they have any fucking previous felonies or if they're,  uh, uh, sex crimes, shit like that.  The, by the way, the ACLU would go so fucking deep into this.  But people used to think that you'd have to have a microchip implanted in you.  Right, right.  Yeah. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  No, it'd be, what's that?  That's a small microchip.  But it doesn't have to be hardware.  Right.  But it doesn't have to be implanted.  Right.  Just a little barcode thing.  But how will you get, because eventually people's blood work and stuff, how will you  get people's blood tests immediately?  Like, how can you scan somebody and read if they have AIDS or if they have fucking high  blood pressure?  I guess if they take their blood, let's say they take their blood test, uh, that information  immediately gets uploaded, um, and, and updates that, that, uh, tattoo. 
[00:25:30]  No, no, but how can you do it past that where you don't even take the blood test where  I can just meet you or Sam and just go, like, toot, and scan?  There has to be a way.  It can be.  That's some fucking Star Trek shit right there.  Yeah, yeah.  There's something inside of you.  Maybe, maybe that's where you have something implanted.  Oh, man.  Which will, uh...  It's like constantly testing your blood for shit?  No, no, no.  There's something that, like, yeah, it picks up, like, when you have something, um, and  so any scanner will read it when it happens, just to prevent, uh, disease.  That would be kind of cool.  Like, like, your phone is constantly reading your, uh, your internal transmitter, uh, health 
[00:26:00]  transmitter, and, uh, checks your blood and everything, and maybe you wake up one day  and it's like, hey, your blood sugar's low.  Yeah, that almost reminds me of, uh, uh, uh, Nike Plus.  You know, it's like a little thing that you put in your shoe.  Yes.  And that connects to your phone, so it reads all, all your, your stats as you're going  for a run.  Oh, hey, look at that.  It's close.  I mean, it's in your shoe, but, I mean, they could just put it in your chest and just reads  your, yeah, reads, reads everything to see if, you know, early detection of a disease. 
[00:26:30]  Well, they're working on that thing for the guys going to Mars.  Uh, they want to have those little...  Spaceships, yeah.  Spaceships.  They're working on spaceships.  Right now, they have, they have cars, but they just can't seem to get them to go straight  up, and plus in space, they get ruined.  They get ruined.  My car was ruined in space.  It was ruined.  No, these, um, the little, those little fucking subatomic things that will test you as you're  going, because if you, if you start getting cancer six months into a three-year trip, 
[00:27:00]  there's nothing you can do about it.  Oh, right, yeah, yeah.  So they want these little things that will test your blood as you're going and kind of go  through your body like little, uh, robots and pick up whatever is wrong with  you and fix it.  Oh, man.  Or at least know it.  Like nanotechnology, yeah.  Yeah.  Imagine that you're, you're fucking on that long trip to Mars, and your little nanotechnology  thing goes off inside you, and you have to make the call to, to NASA, and you hear,  Uh, well, what kind of fluid?  Sorry.  Oh, it's Dr. Steve.  No. 
[00:27:30]  He's the guy that has to tell you what to do.  Yeah.  What would you do?  Oh, oh, the actual thing inside you fixes you?  Or just tells you what it is, and then you know what to do to fix it.  Um, because there's no way for disease prevention, if you have a three-year space trip, there's  nothing you can do.  Well, you got to take a Bones McCoy with you.  Yeah.  Some doctor that could, uh, hook you up.  But from there, from there, eventually it will learn to read, like, all of a sudden you'll  get negative vibes, you'll get anger, and that will register.  And then when you go for a job, they'll go, well, you know what?  You have these really weird anger flares that are showing up in your scan. 
[00:28:00]  I'm telling you.  It really does open up a bunch of things where they'll be able to tell a lot of shit about  you, um, from the outside, not really having to, uh...  Absolutely.  And then eventually, and I'm not being paranoid about Big Brother.  This is the way it's going.  Negative thoughts.  We're so thought policing now.  Negative or racist or inappropriate thoughts will start to be, will start to register.  Oh, boy.  And then eventually they'll find a way to use that, uh, against you. 
[00:28:30]  You guys are very excited about all the possibilities or the things that future is here, like the  QR stuff and all scanning.  That's not that far out of, uh, you know, out of reach.  Now, you have to take the good with the bad.  What about, like, here are some, here are some nanorobots that are, like, legitimate in  your bloodstream, yeah.  Doesn't that just look like, uh, the Matrix?  Yeah, that, that does look like the Matrix.  And, and it opens up some scary stuff if, if there's a malfunction and that thing just  starts eating your liver.  Yeah, you know, so it's, it's like, oh, you know, look at all of this stuff that we've 
[00:29:00]  seen in movies for years starting to come to fruition and stuff.  Well, you know, there's other stuff, too, that, that's along the same lines.  The same people that invented the stuff that's happening now invented the bad stuff, too.  Yeah, and there's always going to be a, a problem with every, you know, solution if  you're making a problem.  We're, we're, we're, I mean, how many years are we away from legitimately becoming the Borg?  Like, that's, that's just a fact.  Like, I mean, it's, I mean, it might be, uh, overblown on TV and the movies, but that's  really where we're headed and we're not too far away from that.  Just some kind of machine.  Where we're just, everyone is all knowing, we're all connected at all times. 
[00:29:30]  I mean, that's just, that's where we're going.  And everybody will know thoughts won't be private anymore.  Everyone's thoughts will be known.  And that's why individuality is a fucking, and I, I've said, it's a primitive quality because  once you're all connected to individuality, you're just part of the collective.  Well, we, I think we're getting a good, uh, a good test to see how people would, um, respond  with that kind of technology based on just social networking, because we are so eager to  throw our private lives out there for everybody to see. 
[00:30:00]  We want everybody to know what we're thinking and, and what we think about a subject.  You read Twitter, uh, on a daily basis.  It's, it's amazing that people want to be heard on, on, uh, subjects that are in the  news and popular culture.  Uh, and this whole thing, like what's going on with, uh, with Kony, you know, everyone  wants to get involved and say, I'm helping the world.  I'm making a difference.  Now people really have this need to make a mark in the world because you feel like you're 
[00:30:30]  just, uh, you know, here for your life and then you're gone.  But if you did something, oh, and now with social networking, um, people feel like they're  doing something, but then you take to the next step where it's more an internal thing  where it's not a, you know, you need that interface of a computer or your phone.  Uh, how much would we be sharing?  Yeah.  With each other.  And then how much, how much personal information that's kind of detrimental to you operating in 
[00:31:00]  a society is going to be thrown out there.  But when things aren't private anymore, when everybody is on the same, cause once we figure  out what makes a thought, like, how can I read your mind specifically, like not the  impulses, but the actual thought itself.  Yeah.  Once we figure that out and we all connect, everyone's going to know everyone's thoughts.  Privacy will be non-existent.  It's embarrassing though.  It is embarrassing, but we'll all have it.  Um, and then you'll start getting penalized for your thoughts or your desires.  Can't wait for that to happen.  And that will eventually go away and people will stop having those thoughts and desires.  Oh, you think that'll make people kind of stop even thinking that? 
[00:31:30]  It will just become, it will just, evolution will remove it.  It's, it's a weird, uh, maybe people always have it, but whenever you see, like aliens  are always so disconnected and like weird.  When do you see aliens?  I should, I should rephrase that.  Yeah.  Jesus, Jim.  Yeah.  Whatever you, whatever you, I see interpretations of, you know, whenever you're going to the  bathroom and you just see one pop out of your penis, whatever you see, uh, whenever  you're eating a vagina and you see teeth, yes, yes.  Whenever you see interpretation of aliens, there are always these like weird fucking 
[00:32:00]  detached things that don't talk, but that's why they're on that fucking, uh, they're in  a whole nother level.  Yeah.  They don't need to talk.  What are they going to yap at each other?  I guess not.  Imagine a woman being fucking tied into your thoughts.  Oh, you wouldn't like that, right?  No, no.  Believe me, she wouldn't either.  No, no.  See, that's why it becomes either embarrassing or detrimental.  He's smiling.  No one's perfect.  He's thinking, cunt, but he's smiling.  He's smiling at me, this lying sack of shit.  Yeah. 
[00:32:30]  That's coming.  I, uh, I was, uh, checking out that whole, uh, Coney thing.  Uh, it's still, I don't think a lot of people.  Is the TBS show still the same as the NBC one?  Because I haven't been checking it out.  Really?  Coney.  I know.  Yeah, everybody's making their Coney jokes.  Uh, this is that guy.  Joseph Coney.  Joseph Coney.  He works here as a maintenance worker.  He's, uh, he's, uh, uh, apparently a very bad man. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  He, um, was in Uganda up until 2006, uh, committing all kinds of, uh, war crimes, kidnapping children,  putting them in his little army where they would go out and, uh, kill and mutilate people.  And he'd make them kill their parents before they left or something.  Yeah, yeah.  Bad guy.  Yeah, really bad guy.  Uh, so everyone's on the bandwagon.  This is the cause du jour, um, where everyone's getting involved, trying to tell celebrities  that they need to get involved.  Um, but I, I've been reading a lot about the organization behind this, this invisible children 
[00:33:30]  thing.  Yeah.  And, oh, invisible Uncle Paul.  Uh, and it just seems to me like, uh, like the operation's a little shady.  I don't know.  There is something that feels weird about it.  Yeah.  But, either way, he, there's a really brilliant marketing thing they're doing.  Oh, amazing.  And, uh, even if they're shady and they're rapists, I don't care.  The, the genius of, like, and then April 20th, they're going to do this really weird thing 
[00:34:00]  where at night, everyone's going to go out and hang up posters when they wake, people  wake up the next morning.  Yeah.  There's going to be these fucking Coney posters all over.  Their job was to make him famous so he can be removed because that will keep pressure  on the government to get rid of him.  Um, it's a really weird experiment of how, uh, everybody can just get, get this message  out there through the back door.  Does that make any sense?  Yeah.  Without, without mainstream, uh, through just social networking only.  But I think if you're in Central Africa, I don't care how fucking famous you are. 
[00:34:30]  I don't think the people there are watching much television.  They're not, but our government is.  And our government, and that's what the thing is, keeps the pressure up to fucking keep  advisors over there or to, or to give some help in getting him.  Um, because when it becomes such a thing at the tip of everybody's tongue in this country,  then this government notices.  And when this government notices, but people, people are questioning whether we even have  any business doing that.  I mean, he's obviously a bad guy, but he's in a line of bad guys.  The organization itself wouldn't stop with his death or capture. 
[00:35:00]  But is he number one on that list?  Uh, yeah, he's number one.  Um, but also he's apparently hasn't been in Uganda since 2006.  Where is he?  In the woods?  He's, uh, in, I think the Congo, um, uh, uh, I, I, north, uh, he went further north  than Uganda, whatever's there, whatever fucking despicable country is there.  But, uh, they, they, they're still kind of funding Uganda and the Ugandan army to, to find 
[00:35:30]  him, but he's not really there.  But isn't he still recruiting Sudan?  Sudan? Yeah, he's in, like, the Sudan.  That's a terrible part of the world.  Which is a horrid place.  Yeah, in the Congo.  Oh.  Yeah, what a, Central Africa is just really a terrible place.  Fuck that, that's where he is, right in the middle of that fucking, oh boy.  So I don't care how fucking famous you are, uh, I think he's just gonna go about his business.  But believe me, nobody, this guy kind of kept, kept in obscurity for a long time. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  And now everybody's gonna know who he is.  It's gonna, it's gonna be harder for him to, uh, to, to not get caught because then  we're gonna put, uh, you know, Predator drones, once they start looking for him, it's gonna  be harder to fucking hide.  I, I don't think we'd ever put Predator drones over fucking Central Africa to look for anything.  There really isn't any interest in, um, in, in, uh, us being there.  Like, people, all right, kids are dying, people are dying, but it happens all over, especially  in, uh, uh, some of these African countries. 
[00:36:30]  But we kind of just don't give a shit.  And now this, you know, it's mostly a youthful movement that, uh, happens and people are  like, oh, we gotta do something.  So it catches fire for a little while and then people forget and it goes back to what  it was.  What happened to Darfur?  Darfur.  Is everything fine and dandy there now?  Or did everybody just kind of lay off that whole thing?  What was happening in Darfur?  Ah, more civil war and, uh, warlords and, and, and killings and war crimes and rapes. 
[00:37:00]  Wouldn't be surprised if my manager was fucking, uh, Facebook friends with Joseph Coney.  He probably hung out with the guy.  Yeah.  That guy looks like one of those movie African bad guys with those, anyone dressed in those  uniforms that he wears, never a good person.  Danny, can you find, uh, on, uh, on, uh, YouTube interview with Joseph Coney.  He granted one interview, I guess to a British journalist who probably had to go through hell  to finally get to him in the jungle.  Cause they, I'm sure they blindfolded him.  Oh, they, they had a meet at some place and then, uh, they had to walk into the jungle 
[00:37:30]  for like over an hour.  That's not bad though.  I mean, how did he get to the place to meet at?  Uh, a bumpy ride in a Jeep.  Oh, but was he blindfolded or?  I don't think so.  I think, you know, once you can disappear into the, into the forest, like he does, he's like  magic.  Well, there's an interview with him.  See how it's done, Sam?  See how it's done?  He's so, he does not seem, he's a charismatic guy though.  You understand why he is a, uh, a leader, but the people around him, the guys he has 
[00:38:00]  guarding him, their eyes, they are fucking, they have zombie eyes, man.  They are, they are hard hearted fucking dudes.  They talk about, uh, just yet gutting people with their bayonets and, uh, it's really, that  is some hardcore shit.  We, when you see the guys, there's a couple of guys around him that you know that they  came as, Oh, I didn't see this part.  Where they go through the, uh, he's going to the interview.  Yeah.  They go to, um, this place in the middle of the bush, uh, that they, and they say it wasn't 
[00:38:30]  even there the day before.  They kind of made a clearing and they put up some huts and then from that area you had  to walk.  So, you know, they really kind of keep this guy under wraps.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But the guy's guarding him directly.  This is a better video.  None of them walking to it.  Like, this is the documentary of, uh, the camera crew going to see Coney.  Yeah.  But, uh, it's just this one guy's interview. 
[00:39:00]  And when you see his guards, man, can you fast forward just a little bit?  I want to see these guys around him.  Like, if this is the moment, this, that's him, but this is not the interview.  Yeah.  So, yeah, I'll just finally get an exclusive interview.  Joseph Coney.  Someone brought up the fact that, uh, like in America, uh, black people, uh, tend to  name their children, these weird fucking African names.  And in the middle, the most African motherfucker there is, this guy is named Joseph. 
[00:39:30]  Joseph.  Who's Charles, uh, the African, uh, yeah.  It's like, yeah, there's a, uh, he's not, he's not named Malik.  No.  That's Joseph.  Hey, oh, that bad guy, Doug.  He's been chasing for a year.  Oh, look at him.  The man who's eluded the Ugandan government for 20 years.  Of the handful of images of Coney, the most famous is the man in his 20s with dreadlocks.  He's wearing a...  He's now in his 40s, but his hatred of the Ugandan president, Yara, the 70s, hasn't changed. 
[00:40:00]  You are the first journalist that has to come to me in the booth like this.  And he speaks English, yeah.  Yeah.  Smart guy.  He's not clicking.  Look at the guys behind you.  Yeah, yeah.  The guy with the green hat.  That's what it is.  They just look fucking hardcore.  Brain.  I have, I wear a glove also.  Describe yourself to me.  Paul, Paul, right there.  Oh, my God.  These fucking guys.  Look at the guys.  Look at that guy. 
[00:40:30]  It's just, yeah, they're showing, uh, the guys.  Their faces, they kind of look like, uh, the cast of Platoon when they found, uh, who was it?  Manny.  Manny.  Who was skinned.  Manny and Sal.  And they were all just standing there and they panned them with the camera with that  dead fucking thousand yard stare.  And they're all just standing still holding their weapons.  Uh, yeah, these are bad, bad people.  Yeah, these are fucking.  Ah, come on in, gentlemen.  What's that about?  Uh, these are very, uh.  Have you got another chair?  Do you want Danny Rusk to stay on the computer? 
[00:41:00]  I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, what, I'm a military position who's fighting, uh, in Uganda.  I'm a freedom fighter who's fighting for freedom in Uganda.  But I'm not a terrorist.  I'm not a terrorist.  And then they're showing kids with, like, their faces cut up.  But the manner used to achieve these political aims has been horrific.  Yeah, he's not a good guy.  He cuts noses and lips off.  He gives them Jackson family nose jobs.  Ah, Joe DeRussi can't look. 
[00:41:30]  It's gross.  It is gross.  I mean, that's me.  I don't mean it's gross.  It's sad.  Well, it is gross.  You've been accused of terrible crimes.  Look at the guy in the back.  He's got his head in his hand and he's just kind of like, ah, let my leader talk about  those war crimes.  I've seen the photos of people with no name.  Yes, yes, yes.  That is propaganda with Musabini men.  And these guys in the background, people pause that.  Atrocity's been very, very good to me. 
[00:42:00]  I love that he's wearing, like, some old dad's soccer shirt.  Yeah.  He's got his microphone.  From, like, Idaho.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Some dude had donated that to the Salvation Army.  Now this savage is wearing his, his soccer shirt.  He's wearing a, uh, Pat's, uh, championship shirt.  I like that the guys in the background are dressed like Anthony.  That's true.  The views just aren't as radical.  There is no negotiating with those guys.  No, no.  That's, that's the face of somebody that you can't go, look, let's make a deal or, hey, 
[00:42:30]  please, I have a family.  Like, these guys that could chop the arms off a kid, like, easily.  I guarantee you could show them an iPhone.  They'd be like, what is that?  What is that?  Okay, give me that.  You can go free.  And then you'd give it to them and they'd cut your fucking dick off and shove it in your  face.  I need more.  You'd give them the iPhone.  They would look at it and they would go, this is the jungle.  And they would throw it in the mud and cut your fucking eye off.  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  iPhone, schmy phone, they would say.  Schmy phone?  AT&T.  The reception here is no good either. 
[00:43:00]  You tried to give me AT&T phone?  Does this have the apartheid app?  Why is Whoopi in the back?  Oh, my God.  So pissed off.  The guy is bored.  There's a guy sitting there that's just bored because he's not ripping someone to shreds  at that moment.  Those are the guys.  Those are the guys that commit those fucking crimes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He really is like, did you guys ever think there's more to life than just cutting these  kids' lips off? 
[00:43:30]  He's the Joe DeRosa of the group.  Come on, man.  Is this it, dude?  Is this hip-hop?  Yeah.  Let's listen to a little more of his wonderful speech.  Are you saying that the LRA have never been involved? 
[00:44:00]  Never been involved in any abductions, any mutilations, any rapes?  Yes.  They've never been involved?  LRA has never been involved.  That's good enough for me.  Oh, this humongous seems like a reasonable man.  But he's a soft-spoken guy and a character like, no, I could not do that to my brother. 
[00:44:30]  He's like a movie guy.  You know who he is, right?  They kidnap fucking kids and make them fight in the rebel.  They are brutal, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking brutal.  I thought there was a new show on Comedy Central.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But now this is like the big cause that's going on now is to kind of make such awareness  of this guy that he has nowhere to hide.  He gets captured and brought to justice for his war crimes. 
[00:45:00]  And it's like the new cause everyone has.  Fuck Occupy, Wall Street.  Fuck Darfur.  It's all about this guy now.  They'll get him.  Yeah.  Because what would happen is as the more interest it grows, the reward...  And he doesn't have religious fanaticism like Bin Laden had.  The more the reward grows for him, because there will be a reward eventually, one of  his own guys will just kill him.  You think?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Bin Laden's bodyguard.  One of his bodyguards turned on him, I think. 
[00:45:30]  Or I know Khaled Mahat.  Those guys even turn on each other.  So these guys absolutely would for the right amount of money.  Oh, yeah.  These guys.  Forget about him.  I don't think there's much loyalty.  For U.S. dollars?  Oh, man.  They're sitting in the jungle.  Yeah.  Nobody wants to hang out in the fucking jungle all day and listen to him talk in his soft voice.  Yeah, it doesn't look like a very organized operation.  It looks like when you would play, like, guns in the woods when you were a kid.  So it gets, you know...  I swear.  Can you imagine that that hard to...  It looks exactly like when I used to go out to Coram to play paintball.  It actually looks like a negative of when we used to go out to Coram to play paintball. 
[00:46:00]  It's COD.  That's it right there.  Yeah, yeah.  That's COD.  Those are the guys you fight.  Oh, and you know which map it is.  And it is.  That's exactly who you're fighting on that map.  Yeah.  Oh, sorry.  These guys are fucking scary, dude.  They are scary fucking...  Because they all have different uniforms.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Those are the scary people.  They all have different uniforms.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They have the desert uniform, but one guy has the fucking Navy SEAL water camo.  Yeah.  They're in the middle of the jungle with desert camo. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, this guy's got the camo that Salt-N-Pepa had in one of their videos.  It's a fluorescent yellow.  Vietnam tiger camo, and another guy's just wearing a fucking Yankee hat.  Where's the general?  He's the guy in the Hawaiian shirt.  Oh, wow.  That's horrible.  Juggling clits.  Juggling.  Could you zip through this a little bit?  We can just look at it.  I kind of like this guy's little diatribe.  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  What's he drinking?  Oh, man.  They all have old weapons that, you know, yeah. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Who's going to play him in the movie?  Jesus Christ.  Somebody from the wild.  They'll probably get Denzel.  Yeah.  You know, gussy him up a little bit.  Look at that guy.  Look at that guy.  That guy has no soul in his eyes whatsoever.  I think that guy was my roommate when I first moved to New York.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, these people.  We're zipping through this.  But he's wearing rain boots.  Wait.  Yeah, stop.  They're all three of them wearing rain boots, and this guy's got a beret that doesn't match 
[00:47:30]  his outfit.  One guy has an Ocean Pacific shirt on.  They're all dressed like they live in the East Village.  One guy's reading Wired Magazine.  They're wearing Urban Outfitters Springline.  But you can tell the guy in the middle is like one of the muckiny mucks, because he's  got like the beret on.  It's like the guy from What's Happening.  It's Raj.  Hey, hey, hey.  We're going to cut your clits off.  Yeah. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, wait till mama sees you cut my clits off.  Surely I'll take a grape soda and a noseless baby boy.  He has a watch on, a cheap Timex.  For what?  You're in the jungle.  It's time to kill someone.  He probably doesn't dress like that normally.  It was probably just for the cameras.  Yeah.  Give me a blue shirt.  I want to wear a blue shirt.  He wants to look more like a regular dude.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He probably wears camo for real.  Not quite military.  Yeah, because if he's dressed like a general, you're thinking he's killing people. 
[00:48:30]  He's got a map.  Look at that horrid map.  Is that a triptych from AAA?  We're using 3D images.  This guy has a map.  Here's a map from mobile.  One inch is a thousand miles.  Go into mobile.  Get the map.  You know what's really funny?  You guys talk about augmented reality and terminated glasses.  Like, literally, look at the end of it.  It really says Uganda Traveler's Map. 
[00:49:00]  Traveler's Map.  Yeah.  And it's the guy's hand who owned it is still attached to it.  Yeah, and they're like, where are we going?  Something.  That ship sucks.  Right?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, they're going over the map for some reason.  And then, what, these village elders he's talking to?  Now he's looking badass.  Yeah, it's a comedy show.  They're going to bring a Starfleet hat on.  Oh, God.  They're negotiating for peace.  These are people that they're talking.  I guess they're all...  Oh, that's good.  So the one side, it's just old people in regular, like, ratty clothes. 
[00:49:30]  And then there's the guys in the camo with the guns.  Turn that a little bit this way.  Who wins the peace?  That's good.  That's good.  I'm just...  I can't stop looking at that guy with his hand under his chin, who has a really weird dreadlock  that almost looks like fucking, like, white guy hair.  Yeah, yeah.  Not that long.  Look at that shit.  Look at the...  Go back on that man's face.  Oh, man.  Back...  Look at that right there.  They are...  Who has to talk to this guy when he's...  And talk your way out of being murdered by that guy?  Oh, it just...  There's nothing you could say.  There's nothing you're going to say that's going to move that guy. 
[00:50:00]  I would just take the billion-to-one shot with a Jedi mind trick.  You don't want to kill me.  Because, like, that's all that's going to work if anything works.  Yeah, but you never know, though.  Have you ever seen the movies that have one little thing like that?  Star Wars?  Hey, Star Wars!  Star Wars!  Like, that's their favorite movie.  Yeah, and they're like, you're Star Wars!  And then you...  Yeah!  That's hilarious.  And you're just stuck doing lines with each other.  They make you reenact it every night.  Yeah, yeah.  Like a Tropic Thunder.  And you do it.  Yeah, like Tropic Thunder, yeah.  Some New York Times reporter was held by the Taliban, 
[00:50:30]  and one of the ways, like, to amuse them,  he would act out Beatles songs.  Oh, my God.  She loves you, yeah, yeah.  Like, if he would do that, he would just sing and dance,  and he amused the Taliban as a Times reporter.  Do you understand, if he did that,  do you understand what I would do?  Oh, man.  I would just be pushing my dink in and out and go,  look, flower grows, flower grows.  I have a vagina.  You'd be like, oh, that reminds me.  Let's cut it off.  It would never work.  It would take around 45 minutes.  It keeps going back in like a turtle's head. 
[00:51:00]  It's got its own defense mechanism, yeah.  That fucking face is...  They just look badass, and they're wrapped in ammunition.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, these are just guys that are just polishing with their guns.  Here's the deal, though.  We could go in and take those guys out in 20 minutes.  Really?  I mean, come on.  Those guys have...  Didn't work in Afghanistan, did it?  That's all their fucking ammo right there,  what he has around his neck.  That's all he has is one...  And then he's out.  I don't get how this guy became the main guy. 
[00:51:30]  He looks like a fucking assistant high school basketball coach.  You know what I mean?  He looks like somebody's dad,  but everybody else is so much scarier.  You'd think one of those crazy fucking guys.  Just think, yeah.  He's the guy that leads those motherfuckers.  Do you know how deceptively fucking vicious he is?  Because he's smiling, and again, he's soft-spoken.  Yeah.  But that guy probably has the fucking...  The worst heart of all of them.  He kind of looks like the...  Who's the guy that hooked up with Florida Evans after James died? 
[00:52:00]  Oh, I don't remember.  JJ?  Kind of looks like that.  No, she didn't hook up with JJ.  He looks like the butler from The Fresh Prince.  The second butler.  Yes, he does.  Who is this guy?  Coney!  Will.  Oh, Coney!  You killed Michael!  You cut Michael's nose off!  Coney!  Michael was such a douche.  Little Michael.  My little militant.  I fucking hated him.  It's Black Jesus, Mama! 
[00:52:30]  Black Jesus.  Here we go.  Yeah, that kid with that most annoying younger sibling on a sitcom ever.  Next to Dee on What's Happening.  Dee was really annoying.  At least she was funny.  She would have those mean lines.  Yeah, yeah.  I enjoyed Dee.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  Yeah, so that's Coney.  The big cause these days.  That look.  Oh, man.  Oh, shit.  One of his guys, they just showed a close-up of. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, shit.  And it's fucking dead eyes, man.  Yeah, he's not even black.  He's Pompinickel.  Yeah.  Like, he's like, holy shit.  He looks like he would be delicious with some mayo and ham.  Think of what he's fucking seen and what he's done.  Dude, the ability to fucking do this.  The ability to fucking mutilate a pussy.  Like, you're killing someone's one thing, but these guys are mutilators.  They're like lip cutter offers.  Yeah.  That's just pure evil.  Jesus Christ. 
[00:53:30]  Scary dude, man.  And you see, like, the online, like, petitions about this stuff.  It's like, here's the thing.  I'm embarrassed to admit this, but, like, after reading all the stuff about, like, the McCarthy  hearings and the blacklist and everything in the 50s.  Yeah.  I don't sign any fucking thing because all those guys, they would just sign something at  a party or something and go, it seems like a nice cause.  And they would sign it.  A communist party.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden, you don't have a fucking career.  So even when I see stuff like about this and it's like, sign to support to get, I'm like,  no, I'm not fucking signing anything. 
[00:54:00]  Just in case he's in charge someday.  Comes back.  Where is Joe DeRosa?  He signed a paper against me.  Oh, yeah.  Or Joseph Coney would be the fucking head of talent at Comedy Central.  Or some job.  Wow.  He'd really have to make up for some evils to get that gig.  I don't like alternative.  I like high energy.  Where is Robert Kelly?  I like his humor.  He danced.  Big fat man dance.  Wow.  Geez.  Lose weight? 
[00:54:30]  Lose weight?  I lost a little bit.  I like that he hit me with a nice fat one.  And then he goes, did you lose weight?  Lose weight?  Did you?  He hit me and he hurt me and then he hugged me.  He hit me and hurt me.  What are you working on?  Because everybody here is working on the points.  The points.  The Weight Watchers points.  I'm on the South Beach and I actually started working out again.  I went back to the gym last week in Minneapolis.  It was either that or fucking hang myself on the fucking Crown Royal.  Oh.  Pumping some iron. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  The gym.  Fucking gym, man.  It's just, there's no way around it.  I was talking to him about it.  There's no, you got to go back and sit on that stupid treadmill.  Yeah.  And go up and down and up and down.  And there's a guy next to me just running.  He's over in his 50s.  Chcoom, chcoom, chcoom, chcoom, chcoom.  You just hear that shit on the treadmill.  Yes.  And you're just guilty because you're going.  I'm going, I'm going.  I like this.  Chcoom, chcoom, chcoom, chcoom.  Chcoom, chcoom, chcoom, chcoom. 
[00:55:30]  Chcoom, chcoom, chcoom.  Chcoom.  All right.  Chcoom.  Chcoom.  Guys pounding away on the fucking treadmill.  It's just, it's.  But then they look over at you.  And you know.  Yeah.  If I'm looking at your speed and I'm looking at how fat, I know you're looking over at  me.  Because when I was in shape, I would look over at fat people and be like, come on, push  it up a little.  Try a little kid.  You're wasting your time.  Yeah.  Wasting your time.  And then they're fucking like straight up and down, perfect running form. 
[00:56:00]  Like gazelles.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, because there's no, there's no mercy like in something like that.  Like if you're in good shape, physical shape, you have to be so regimented and fucking Nazi  like about it.  I feel like you have to hate people out of shape because it's dude, it's always a fucking  cheeseburger away.  Like, you know what I mean?  Like you get in that groove and you're eating the sprouts and the fucking working out all  that stuff.  And the day that you go, fuck it, I'm going to get KFC today.  It's just falls the fuck apart. 
[00:56:30]  You don't go back.  One fucking burger isn't going to do shit to you.  You could go right back to your bean sprouts and stuff and not be affected in the least.  But for some reason, when you fuck up, you go like, well, I fucked up.  I might as well just keep fucking up.  No, it is though, though.  It's when your mouth is clean, when you're not eating shitty and you're the sodium and  you don't crave that carb and the sodium and then all of a sudden you have it, you want  it.  You remember how great it was.  Yeah.  It's that carb and salt and fatty. 
[00:57:00]  It reminds you.  I'm having such a hard fucking time getting back to a good eating regimen because of that  fucking cruise.  And yeah, you know what I did the other day?  There was there was a and who I could fucking strangle sometimes.  She buys delicious treats for the house and she she brought over a coffee cake, fucking  coffee cake.  I didn't even get a knife out to cut a piece off.  I opened up the box.  My hand was like a spatula.  I fucking cracked a corner off and I'm just eating it. 
[00:57:30]  Are you talking to me like that surprises me?  Bob is shocked that you opened the box.  Bobby just looked at me the way Alky's look at each other in a meeting when somebody's  having a good share.  But here's the thing is everybody in this room, like all of us, except for Sam, is  I mean, we're all fatties.  But you're you used to be a fatty. 
[00:58:00]  No, I was never a fatty.  But you had some.  I was I was way out of shape.  Yeah, you was.  And I was definitely.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You get out of shape and you.  I've been to your house to your house.  I'd be a mess.  And the older you get.  And this is true, too.  You get money when you get money.  When I was in my 20s, I couldn't afford a black shirt with just coffee.  How's this?  Coffee on your shirt. 
[00:58:30]  You know, joy.  You just brought Anthony.  I was going to the gym yesterday and I looked down and I only have like two shirts that fit  me to go to the gym.  I looked down and there's fucking this egg yolk on my shirt.  There's just egg from from me eating and you can't get it was already dried.  So it's like you're going to chip it off with your fingernail.  I hate him.  Yeah, it's so hard.  But I don't think I've ever I don't I think I've always taken the time to get a knife out 
[00:59:00]  and cut a little block of coffee cake.  And then I realized I'm just and then as I'm eating the coffee cake, I'm looking around  for something else to fucking eat.  Dude, what is that?  I do.  Do you plan your meal?  I plan my meals out like when I'm going to have a real fat ass day.  I'm like, I'm going to fucking eat tacos for dinner.  So I can't eat any red meat for lunch.  All right.  We're going to go fried chicken at lunch.  You justify tacos at dinner.  And if I know and then I'm like, I want to I really say to myself, but if I eat this 
[00:59:30]  now, what am I going to eat at eleven thirty p.m.?  And I have to figure it out like thinking that far ahead.  Yeah, I don't want to eat barbecue chicken now because then I won't be able to eat  something sweet later.  You know, I really it's fucking terrible.  You understand the amount of food I can actually eat is so impressive to even me.  I can fucking stuff my fat face.  Yeah, I can sit down.  I'll get a burrito and I'll look at my wife.  We'll get the burrito.  We'll get chips and we'll get all this shit. 
[01:00:00]  You got me hooked on those fucking lime.  Those lime.  Oh, tostitos.  Lime tostitos.  This fucking Satan brought lime tostitos to my house.  Why are they I can't stop eating the best thing ever?  Oh, yeah.  Your stomach.  It's it's like the you impress it.  I think it's like the boss on Mad Men going Draper.  I don't know how you do it.  You impress me every time.  I can.  I can put it away.  Yeah, I can put food.  The fuck I can eat a whole pizza and chicken wings and like chips, like a bag of chips. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, boy.  I can't talk food around this guy.  Oh, boy.  What's the fattest?  The fattest assest thing I ever did was I think was in front of Bobby.  I was at his house.  We were podcasting and I started shaking and I was like, I'm so fucking hungry, dude.  I haven't eaten.  And I went over going.  I'm on a diet.  Dawn and made like apple cake.  And I'm like, I'm not eating that fucking cake, man.  I'm on a diet.  I'm good.  Dude, an hour went by.  I was like, I'm starving.  I got up.  I was taking pieces of cake and dunking it into a tub of butter. 
[01:01:00]  No fucking way.  I swear to God.  And he's going, you fucking piece of shit.  Why were you dunking it in butter?  Because it was delicious.  I mean, why?  Because it was dunkable.  Why would you not do that?  Why would you get a fork out and spread it on evenly?  Fuck it.  Dunk it in.  It would seem like just eating it gets you thinking like, eh, probably shit.  But then to make that leap, to start dunking it in butter.  This was the thought process because he gave me, he gave me a thing. 
[01:01:30]  He goes, put some butter on it, dude.  He really is like a fucking devil.  Yeah.  And he gives me the, I love you for it.  He gives me the tub.  Yeah.  And there was only butter at the very bottom.  It was almost empty.  Oh, good thing.  And I was like, well, it's more efficient if I just dunk the cake.  I woke up the other night at three in the morning and there was pork ribs from the barbecue place.  Korean barbecue is my new thing now.  Oh, God, I can't stop going to Korean barbecues.  I like it, but it's a fucking working for it and cooking your own meat. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, yeah, that's the thing you were talking about where you've got to cook it at the table.  Yeah, don't always sit there and wait.  By yourself.  Oh, they did it for you.  They cooked it.  I cooked it for you.  I cooked the whole meal for you.  Yeah, I know that, but you're my friend.  If I was by myself, who would have done it?  No one.  The lady does it.  The lady does it for you.  Yeah, they make you eat it like you're actually in North Korea.  Yeah.  You've got to squat on the floor.  Yeah.  Every time you're squatting like you're taking a shit no matter what you're doing there.  Yeah, reading, eating, fucking squat.  You want to eat?  Huh?  You want to eat?  Oh, yeah, we should do that.  Yeah, we'll take a little break. 
[01:02:30]  We'll eat some food, then we'll be back with the lovely and talented Joe DeRosa and Bobby  Kelly, and of course, James Norton, and me.  I want to promote this morning, 10 o'clock, tickets for June 9th at the MGM Foxwoods Casino  go on sale this morning.  It's a June 9th show.  Myself, Artie Lang, Nick DiPaolo, and Dave Attell on June 9th, 10 o'clock.  Can I say a promotion?  Yes.  I'm going to be at McGoobie's next week.  Yeah, exactly.  It's a good gig.  Yeah, McGoobie's Comedy Club next Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. 
[01:03:00]  McGoobie's.  Yeah.  I'm doing a bunch of shows for the next two weeks through the Southeast, starting this  coming Tuesday in Asheville, North Carolina, hitting Atlanta.  What are you, Smokey and the Bandit?  That's bootlegging, because he's thirsty.  He took a gun across the state line.  That kidnap, that's a man act.  He's never been missing.  Kidnapping, or background, is baby shit compared to what this dude's doing. 
[01:03:30]  My bad.  But Joe DeRosa is a truck dude.  Where are you going to be, Joe?  I'm going to the Southeast.  Break up for the Joe DeRosa.  I'm going to Greenville, North Carolina, to Atlanta, Georgia, Chattanooga, Tennessee.  Pick up a truck again.  Double course.  With snowmen.  It ain't never been done before, hot shit.  Visit JoeDeRosaComedy.com for details. 
[01:04:00]  All over the Southeast.  There you go.  From Texarkana.  The best line of that movie is when Burt Reynolds goes, that's great psychology.  Why don't you try to say something mean about my mom next?  Your mama.  Is so ugly.  The little midgy guy?  Yeah, probably.  It's the best part of the movie.  Although I like when he's in the car with Junior, no one makes you fatigue justice look  like a possum's peckin'. 
[01:04:30]  He goes, except for that, shut your ass.  Shut your ass.  He had an answer.  Except for that, shut your ass.  That's a great fucking movie.  All right, yeah, we'll take a break and we'll be right back.  This is the O.P. Anthony Channel.  On Sirius XM.  You might think you can sing.  But you're wrong. 
[01:05:00]  Come to Joe Frazier's karaoke camp.  Call me Smoke Wave.  And learn to sing like a champ.  Who's making love with my old lady while I'm out making love?  Joe doesn't just teach you to sing the classics.  He beats the awful right out of you.  When a man loves a woman.  Words is the most important thing to, let's say, songs.  Because sometimes, you know, you...  After a few short weeks with Joe's unique approach to vocal training, you'll be belting out tunes 
[01:05:30]  just like Smoke and Joe belted Muhammad Ali.  Or you'll have brain damage.  Spend two amazing weeks in Joe Frazier's 700-square-foot apartment above his Philadelphia boxing gym.  And floor your friends with your amazing vocal chops.  Joe might have high blood pressure, diabetes, and needs to carry a cane to stand upright.  But his magical voice will bring you to tears.  Mustang selling now, baby.  Oh, yeah.  Think you better slow than Mustang down. 
[01:06:00]  Ow!  And if that doesn't, his left hook will.  You'll be hitting the high notes faster than Joe Frazier hits the canvas.  Come to Joe Frazier's karaoke camp.  Where our motto is...  Me, you ain't used these as you better.  Hey, dawg.  Serious accent.  It's the OPN entry show.  It was all a dream.  I used to read Word Up magazine.  Salt and pepper and heavy D up in the limousine.  Hanging pictures on my wall.  Every Saturday, rap attack, Mr. Magic Molly Mall. 
[01:06:30]  I let my tape rock till my tape pop.  Smoking weed and bamboo, sipping on private stock.  Way back when I had the red and black lumberjack.  With the hat to match.  Remember rapping Duke?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You never thought that hip-hop would go like this far.  How many years ago?  All right.  Hey, sexy.  Hi, Anthony.  Hey, good morning.  How many years ago did he die?  15 years ago.  15 years.  At the age of 24.  At the age of 24.  That's it?  That's it.  Yeah.  Damn, yo. 
[01:07:00]  I love Biggie, man.  Biggie.  Biggie's good, man.  And it launched the career of P. Diddy.  Puffy.  Puffy.  Puffy.  Puffy, as he was known.  Puffy.  Puffy.  Puffy.  Puffy.  Puffy.  Puffy.  Puffy.  Puffy.  Puffy.  Puffy.  Puffy.  Puffy.  Puffy.  Puffy.  Puffy.  Puffy.  Puffy.  He made a whole career out of the fact that he was a flunky for the dead talented guy.  Jesus Christ.  That's true.  He ran the record label.  He was a flunky.  He produced all the songs.  I'm with Anthony.  All right.  Anthony's right.  And then he made a name for himself by doing that fucking Sting tribute song. 
[01:07:30]  With the stupid dancing in a puddle.  Right.  Right.  Fucking aggravated.  I could have done that dance move.  And that put him all over the top.  People already knew who he was.  Everybody was all.  Not to the point of P.  Diddy fame.  Well, I don't think.  And he never would have gotten that fame if he would have stayed with Biggie.  If Biggie would have stayed alive.  That's not true.  Yes, it is.  The guy's produced hit after hit after hit.  He did this beat.  He loved the beat.  Right?  He didn't do this beat.  He didn't do this beat.  You guys are delusional.  He didn't do this.  You're looking at the world through brown colored glasses. 
[01:08:00]  You just said.  Jesus.  He just said that like it's a fact.  You don't even know that's a fact.  Look at that.  You do it.  I'm not into my job.  You've got a computer.  Look at that.  You've got a computer.  Use your fingers.  You've got a computer.  This is a sample from a song called Juicy from the 1980s.  He sampled it, but it's still.  But he produced the song.  Right.  But here's the point.  I think he's a little more than his lackey.  I think, you know.  I'm not a big tough daddy there.  You've got to be careful, though.  You can't sing Biggie songs on planes. 
[01:08:30]  No.  Now you know.  You can't do that.  Oh, wow.  No.  Why just planes?  I've actually done that.  I've just been on a plane.  I've been like, no, nigga.  And you look around like, oh, shit.  Why can't you?  You've obviously bought two seats.  Oh, gee.  See, the guy next to you wouldn't be there.  What, do you want me to laugh at it?  What?  What, do you want me to fucking join in on the fun, you thin cunt?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  He really hit it with a, he really hit it with a Mr. Roper delivery, too.  He did, too. 
[01:09:00]  Why not?  Joe doesn't like my delivery on anything.  Why don't you do everything but roll your sleeves up before you said that.  Ha, ha, ha.  You should have looked at Sam and then turned to me slowly like the fourth wall was broken.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Away we go.  Why not?  You bought two seats.  No.  Party.  Take the sloths and cut off.  I jailbroke my phone, and it's awesome. 
[01:09:30]  Why do you do that in this day and age?  Look at that.  Let me see.  What's the cool thing?  All right.  So you got the little spirally thing from anywhere.  And all my stuff is right on the front screen now.  Boom, like that, dude.  You open it up.  You tap it.  Boom.  And then look at this.  Boom.  It's a flashlight automatically.  I don't even have to fucking do nothing.  Wow, that's actually pretty cool when you jailbreak it.  Yeah, let's fucking check this out.  It's a flashlight.  Oh, wow.  And now I can do this, too, which is awesome.  I can put attachments in my mail now, like photos, more than one. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, I like that.  More than one photo, video, whatever I want.  I can attach to an email now.  It has that little paper clip.  They should do that, yeah.  Can I see the neat things?  Because you faced it that way.  I couldn't see any of the stuff you did.  That would be cool.  So when you jailbreak it, let me involve Joe into this.  Wait, when you jailbreak it.  No, you wait.  Joe needs to see.  Joe needs it.  When you jailbreak it, how do you make it go back to regular?  You hit the button.  It has a regular button.  Oh, that's good.  You hit the button, and it's regular. 
[01:10:30]  No.  See, right here.  I don't have to jailbreak it.  So you couldn't upgrade it to 5.1, then.  It does.  You just un-fucking-jailbreak it.  And then you got to jailbreak it again.  Nobody.  Ooh, it takes four seconds.  Nobody can make swiping in one direction sound like more tedious and exhausting than Bobby.  You'd be like, why'd you get that new iPad?  Because, dude, you can swipe like this.  Dude, swiping like this stinks.  Dude.  Yeah.  Up and down all day.  Ugh.  Go fuck yourself.  Now I can go horizontal or vertical.  I'm swiping, I got my coffee, I can zip shit. 
[01:11:00]  You know what's a fucking great app for the phone?  And this, you don't have to jailbreak it for the TurboScan.  Because now you can take a photo.  You don't have to have to sign something, like a document, and send it back.  And you just take a picture of it, sign it on your iPhone, and then send it back.  And it makes it a PDF file.  That is pretty goddamn good.  Yeah, but how do you get the whole thing in the photo without your fucking, you get half  your desk in the picture?  No, you don't.  You fucking, it has a crop button, you fucking, you loon.  Settle down.  Dude, there's an apple juice and a banana in the photo, and I'm going to send this 
[01:11:30]  back to NBC's.  I got to send this to my lawyer?  I didn't touch that boy.  Dude, there's a bloody hand with a pinky missing.  That would be funny, like little things you can put in the picture of your contract.  A picture of two men sucking into his cocks.  Send just a silhouette of two dudes putting their cock heads together.  Or just the top eighth of an inch of your cock heads so you kind of know what it is.  What is that?  It looks like a cock head.  It's got a zit on a truck.  In the contract. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, you can't get zits on a dick.  That's like the two cocks would be Jim's like wax stamp like they used to have in the  old days.  To certify that it was Jim.  Yeah.  Two cross dicks.  That's pretty cool.  A little sword fight.  That's his crest.  I got my Twitter right on the front now, too.  Right with your jailbroke phone.  Right then.  With the kids.  With the things.  Yeah, but this is what it's like with him.  And I'll see him at the cellar tomorrow.  I'll be like, you know what, dude?  You fucking get the app.  You put the app.  Look at the door.  Look right in the front.  And here's what it's like with you guys. 
[01:12:30]  Guys.  Six months later.  I jailbroke my phone.  It's the best thing ever.  Me too, Anthony.  We should blah, blah, blah.  You guys were talking about stuff this morning that I told you that's shit with the fucking  animation stuff.  I talked about that on the show.  Fucking five years ago I talked about that.  Stop it.  Rewind the tapes.  Rewind the tapes.  Five years ago.  I swear to God.  Maybe you were speculating as we all do about the future.  That shit's been out for a long time.  Not on phones, but on your computer.  You print out the paper and you hold it up to the computer. 
[01:13:00]  To what on the computer?  The fucking game.  I turn Italian when I get nervous.  Bob's phone case on the back has a little area for your fucking...  It's got a little wallet-like thing.  But he shows this off like it's the fucking wheel.  He's like, look at this dude.  You put your Metro card, your credit card, and then he turns it back to the phone and  then back again.  You put all these cards in here.  So when you lose your phone, you lose everything.  Exactly.  No, other way around. 
[01:13:30]  My father once told me is when you have something important attached to your house  keys, you won't lose it because it means something to you.  I agree with that.  Thank you.  I agree with that.  You know, Anthony, we're not...  Can you tell me that before you fucking balled up his fist?  Not that father.  The third one.  Yes, Joe.  We're not all highfalutin' big time rollers like you are.  Some of us need to hang on to our wallets.  Well, not a man of my means can afford every luxury.  Yeah, you don't have a wallets.  You have a guy that holds your money. 
[01:14:00]  Fucking butler, cunt.  He's a lieutenant with a gun holding a bag of dice.  The douchiest thing fucking kubia I've ever seen him do.  We were at a bar the other week and he gets up to leave and I go, I go, he goes, let me,  I was like, whatever, the fucking check came.  And he gets up and he goes, I got it.  And I go, no, no, no.  And he goes, I got it.  And I go, no, no, no, he tosses a hundred dollar bill at me.  He goes, take it, dude.  I got tons of those.  He really is just an ass.  Because I hate the argument of, no, I got it, I got it. 
[01:14:30]  So I'd rather just say something dumb that just stops the stupid argument.  Right.  Yeah, and then you did take the bill.  No, Bill, I'll take the check.  Okay, Ralph.  I'm not, I'm not.  I don't have the money.  I'm a bus driver.  Well, I tell you what, though.  I mean, I don't, you know, Norton has some cash, too.  But Norton's a very generous one.  Of course.  You go out with Norton, I mean, he literally fucking, he'd take you to really nice places  and just picks up the tab, no problem.  That's how you should be.  That's very nice.  You've got a few extra bucks with your friends. 
[01:15:00]  That's right.  You spend.  Yeah.  That's how it is.  That's how I do it.  That's right.  Guys, in 20 years, I'd like to take you all out.  All right.  When I reach that point, I'd like to take all of you out.  Joe is very generous, though, when he goes out to a bar and see, you're always, you know.  I like to buy some drinks from my friends.  All I know is he fucking spills drinks on my iPhones with those long fingers when he's  trying to make a point.  I pestered in for months to come hang out in a bar with me.  I'm like, just come fucking hang out with me in a bar. 
[01:15:30]  It gives me a little just to come hang.  And he's like, fine, dude.  I'll fucking go.  Me and Bill Schultz go to a bar.  Me and Schultz.  Not a bar.  It's like a bar from 1978 New York.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, it's like a dude with an afro and a pick outside.  It's like, yo, man, what's the code word?  I'm fucking going to this stupid bar.  Jeff Goldblum was arm wrestling a guy in the corner.  He's there 10 fucking minutes.  I'm shit-faced.  I hit my beer by accident.  It spills all over his iPhone.  Oh, shit. 
[01:16:00]  The Republican Party for a bar.  Oh, God.  It was fun.  I literally was like, okay, all right.  Bye.  All right, guys.  I got to go.  It's really got to suck, though, being with drunk people at a bar because they are just  knocking shit over and talking loudly about shit you couldn't care about.  Oh, it's just awful.  But what about, you know, I'm not interested in anything.  Everyone becomes very adamant about what they're saying.  And you're just, and you're not drunk.  So it stinks. 
[01:16:30]  Well, I remember that one.  But then they get offended.  They get offended.  That's what, I don't mind being there.  Just don't, stop getting offended and sensitive.  Dude, you all right?  Am I, I'm fine.  Yeah, you want, I know you're not drinking, but you're good.  Oh, I would never ask that.  You know, listen, I don't, am I being too loud?  No, just shut your fucking face.  Jimmy's right, though, with that whole, you know, dude, it's fucking, you know, they're  playing politics on it.  It's just inane arguments that have no point, that go round and round with no real knowledge 
[01:17:00]  or shit behind it.  High school fucking thinking.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the government, dude, they're all, oh, shut up.  Yeah, they ought to bomb that place into the stone age, make it a parking lot for us.  Oh, God.  How do you people do that?  This place, too, with us in it.  You fucking bore.  I've been sober for 26 years.  I'm sober 26 years.  Now I'm home with my iPhone and a bag of brown rice because you're a fucking asshole.  Oh, long fingers.  It's not just, you know, it really, I guess it really isn't for you guys just about the 
[01:17:30]  addiction and not drinking and either health or your mental state when you did drink.  It's just not being around those assholes.  Well, by those, I mean me.  Yeah, but you're not an asshole.  Joe's actually a good drunk.  He's a funny drunk.  He's not.  Yeah, yeah.  You guys are fun.  Thank you.  Yeah, I mean, look, when I drank, I was a fucking asshole.  You're a fucking asshole sober.  That's what I'm saying.  You're a fucking bully.  Yeah, damn. 
[01:18:00]  All right.  You win.  You know, you win.  Jimmy has me down, though, man.  He just says I get very loud and I repeat myself over and over again with stories and  things.  Yeah.  But it's always with my eyes at half mass and a full smile.  It's like being in the pool with Billy Batts.  I'm going to get what's coming to me.  All right.  You know it.  I know.  I heard you in the fucking beef and the jacuzzi when you said I did my fucking time.  You look over, he's just smiling.  He's holding one bullet. 
[01:18:30]  You're like, what the fuck?  Where did he get that?  Yeah.  Let's do karaoke.  Let's do karaoke.  Yeah, motherfucker.  You're right.  I am very boisterous.  It's great.  I mean, loud drunk.  But it's not an annoying drunk.  He's a fun drunk.  Not at all.  Not at all.  I'm having fun.  People that are annoying drunks is when they come up.  They just start talking to you and they just stay and they won't get the hint and they  just keep yapping and then they get sensitive.  I hate sensitive drunks.  Right.  They fucking suck. 
[01:19:00]  What's the matter?  What?  Am I annoying you?  What am I annoying?  No, no.  Dude, it's cool.  It's cool.  You know, you got to have me on a show, man.  You got to have me on.  Oh, no.  Shut the fuck up.  No.  The worst.  Oh, God.  I know.  The fucking worst.  That's E-Rock.  It's like my father used to say, you know, just fucking, you do it or you don't do it.  You know, when they start doing all those fucking philosophies.  I'll tell you, bro, I'm fucking, this is a great drunk one that comics get. 
[01:19:30]  I'll tell you, bro, I'm fucking hilarious, dude.  You know what I mean?  Like, I thought about getting up there and, dude, shut, you know you haven't.  Get the fuck out of my face.  I could do that and shit.  You know, I got material.  But I got a family.  But I got a family.  You know.  Oh, God.  No, dude, am I bugging you?  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to bug you, man.  No, no.  And then they turn away and say something like, you're bugging the big comedian.  Yes.  Like, then it's got to be that. 
[01:20:00]  It drives me nuts when you're taking a picture of people and they go like, they'll say like,  hey, I'm not gay or anything.  I'm not accusing you of homosexuality because we're taking a photo.  You awkward fucking dummy.  Shut up.  You know about the gay fighter in the UFC?  What?  You know about that?  You must be right.  He just hits them with like this.  Hi.  He's like the gay slap.  He's actually.  Hi.  He hits them with his purse like Ruth Buzzy.  He's actually.  UFC.  Uncut fucking cock. 
[01:20:30]  He did gay porn.  But he's a badass.  He's a good fighter.  He's.  There's nothing worse than that.  A guy can kick your ass.  Just get down there and suck it.  I'm the alpha.  What do you mean?  There's nothing worse than that.  That's your fantasy.  It's not gay.  He's forcing me.  I can't come without fingerprints in his head.  I sent Jimmy a picture of my underwear.  I had a night omission. 
[01:21:00]  What?  I had a night omission.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  You.  I came in my pants.  I was sleeping.  Wow.  Those are great.  I had a full, full-fledged orgasm in my dream.  Like I.  Awesome.  I came in my dream and I woke up and my pants were fucked.  What food products were you dreaming of?  Donuts.  Donuts dipped in chocolate.  Sorry, Jim.  That's funny.  Am I ahead of the pictures?  Do you still have it?  No.  I do.  No, don't.  We don't have to fucking show people my jizz. 
[01:21:30]  I'm going to show my room full of guys my jizz panties.  Wet dreams are always great.  It's like, oh, man.  I haven't had one.  It's so rare, though.  Yeah.  They're very rare.  It was fucking amazing.  I came.  I was fooling around with this chick and then we went to go do it and she got on her belly  and I pulled her pants down and put it in just a little bit.  Yeah.  Just like with the pants were still on and I put it.  Isn't it amazing that the feeling is exactly the same in a dream as it is in real life? 
[01:22:00]  Like, you literally get that feeling.  Your mind fucking makes it.  Yeah.  Amazing.  It was crazy.  I woke up with just warm jello in my pants.  Oh, shit.  And I was like, oh, my God.  I thought a little bit.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  I've done that where there's a little remnants of some pre-sem.  Yeah.  Right.  But this was a full on.  I'm trying to find the picture of your underwears.  Wow.  Wow.  I did a thing where I didn't watch porn for like a month and I was reading up on it online 
[01:22:30]  and there were guys that like...  Oh, you're in a coma?  I had to stop watching it for a little while.  I was really approaching fucking Jake the Snake territory.  Oh, shit.  If you ever saw that documentary where he's like, you got two chicks in the corner peeing  on each other.  Can't get up for your wife no more.  I was like, I don't want to be that guy.  So, but I was reading up on stuff online and there were guys saying like they cut out  porn completely and after like maybe three months they started to have wet dreams again 
[01:23:00]  and stuff.  Oh.  I never had one.  Because they cut down masterminds.  It was the most amazing thing.  I wish I could do it at will.  I wish I could do it again.  It was unbelievable.  I'll find the picture.  It would be nice.  I just came home from doing radio.  I was in Vegas.  I was up all night.  Did radio.  Came home.  Took a shower.  Shaved.  I like put on brand new fresh underwear right out of the package and I went to bed and  then I woke up and they were just ruined. 
[01:23:30]  It looked like, you know, when you go in the salt water with something cotton on and then  like around where the wet is, it's just like, like white salty.  It like wicks in all of the solid particles.  Yeah.  Go out to the edges of the wet stain.  Yeah.  Is that what that is?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I never knew why a stain did this.  Science.  It's fucking kumia.  Hey, you must be watching that new show about the, the, the, uh, the fucking end of the  world motherfuckers.  Oh yeah.  Doomsday people. 
[01:24:00]  The preppers.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've seen that.  I like how they show it, but then they give them a little test at the end.  They give them a little assessment of how well they're doing.  Yeah.  And some people are just armed to the teeth and fucking, you know, they have some food,  but the guns are the big thing.  And then I saw this one where they had a family and, uh, they were growing food and  it was very communal and they're like, well, we don't have weapons because that's not what  we're about.  We think we could, um, get everything we need through love and mutual understanding and  community. 
[01:24:30]  And all I'm thinking is fucking like the road warrior guys rolling up on them, just  shooting, raping and taking everything they have.  And they're not taking into account mental illness.  There are crazy people out there that can't be negotiated with because they're nuts.  And in that environment where it would be like a, you know, kill or be killed.  Uh, you're either going to starve or take someone's food.  You know, you're, you're done for, but you take away electricity.  I remember when New York had that power outage.  Remember we're in the same building.  I was with a girl.  It was, we're buying her birthday gifts in Macy's and all of a sudden the power went 
[01:25:00]  out.  So I didn't have to pay for her gifts.  Oh, nice.  We walked back to my house and we just walked out with the stuff.  No, we just left it on the thing.  Oh, okay.  One day without power, the, the, there was no cops to direct traffic.  People were just blowing lights, almost killing people.  Civilians, civilians were trying to direct traffic.  And then as soon as the sun went down, there was no street lights.  And when there's no, you do forget that the city lights, uh, to be able to see walking  down the street, it was, there's no electricity.  It's the fucking woods. 
[01:25:30]  It's the fucking woods of New Hampshire, New Hampshire.  We're walking up the street.  There's a barrel on fire.  A guy came up behind me and my, my wife and went, and you couldn't see him.  You couldn't see him.  The, the, the people that were in their, uh, uh, element were the homeless people.  They were like, fuck it.  Yeah.  They were walking around grabbing, uh, chicks, asses and tits and molesting chicks.  All this fucked up shit was in one day.  If we didn't get that power on, it would have been, it would have been fucking a wrap.  My car was available because I was parked in the same building on 43rd street. 
[01:26:00]  And my car was in a place where they could just back it out.  They didn't have to lower it.  I was very lucky.  Oh yeah.  So I went for a ride around the city like that.  It was really, it was cool.  It's pretty creepy.  And you do realize like.  It's pretty a fucking car.  Carlos and Peter the park.  Yeah.  Carlos, can I get my, what thing?  What thing?  What thing?  That's what?  Seven.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Oh, Frank's car was better.  You remember that guy who worked at night shift at that fucking place?  That stole your shit?  No, that was the day shift guy.  That scumbag.  This other guy, uh, the other guy who would never smile or say hello. 
[01:26:30]  That fucking like, uh, third world fucking guy should be in the back of a pickup with a  machine gun.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was a fucking late night parking attendant who Bob and I hated to.  And we both had our cars in the building.  Yeah.  But Carlos was the shit.  And be the fucking car.  Carlos.  We are very close to, uh, to just complete anarchy at some point.  When, when, when there's no electricity, uh, if it lasted for a while and it was just  not, not just like one city, one city is bad enough, but imagine an entire breakdown 
[01:27:00]  of the system and, uh, uh, in the whole country or, or the world.  Katrina, Katrina, they were shooting at cops stealing.  They would just, when that shit happened, they just said, fuck it.  They were doing it before the hurricane.  Yeah, exactly.  You're acting like that was Bev Hill.  Bev Hill.  Oh my God.  They were, they were shooting at cops, taking whatever the fuck they wanted.  The cops were looting.  It was, it was, I couldn't imagine New York city without electricity for a week. 
[01:27:30]  Very, New York city has gotten, uh, away from the seventies, New York city, where there's  this veneer of politeness and this like this little thin layer of where we're a great city.  It's safe now.  We got that.  But man, you take away those fucking times square lights and, and, uh, stop the subways  and shit like that over Johnny, that shit will peel off and the ugly New York will come  out.  Carlin did Carlin on his second to last special did a really good bit about like what it would 
[01:28:00]  take for the, everything to collapse.  And he goes, all we would have to do is lose electricity.  Yeah.  And he started to, he gets really into like exactly what would happen.  And he's like timeline.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he, and he talks about, because Joe doesn't have real life experiences.  He has TV and movie experiences.  Does anybody have real life experience with the end of the world?  I was there.  The lights went out.  They were giving away free ice cream at all the bodegas.  I was in the house.  I did.  That's what you remember from that experience. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  Ice cream.  And you do too.  You're right next to me.  Oh, okay.  Remember the ice cream?  I do.  We were very happy.  Yay pudding.  The most fascinating part about it is he talks about the jails and he, and how all the prison  cells are electronically, they're, they're controlled.  The doors are controlled electronically.  He's like, so if power went down, like actually went down, the fucking cells would all open  up.  Oh, they got to have some back.  And he talked about like everybody that would come out of the jails and he's like, and he  just is listing everybody. 
[01:29:00]  And he's like, and these are just the ones we caught by the way.  Like everybody else is still out there.  That wouldn't happen.  That actually wouldn't happen.  They're on generators.  They have a lot of back.  What about a complete wipeout?  Yeah.  Like forever.  Like if electricity went down forever, the end of the world would occur within like three  months or something like that.  We're having solar flares now.  Crazy ass fucking solar flares are going on.  I told you that would happen.  Don't have a point at me.  Dude, five years ago.  I said it.  We got an app for it.  Yeah.  We have the sun app.  We have the solar flares. 
[01:29:30]  And I don't remember snow this winter.  Do you know that we had that one storm like on Halloween?  I'm wearing a hoodie.  And then, you know, it's been nice.  No snow.  No real.  Yeah.  But I keep a chunk of cash.  Yeah.  I got a fat chunk of cash and I got a game plan.  And because when that electricity went out, I got into a fight with Don because I because  that was after September 11th.  And I was like, if anything happens, you get the fuck wherever you are. 
[01:30:00]  Get up the highway and meet me at the house.  That's what we do.  We meet at the house no matter what.  This this fucking broad went out for margaritas.  I call her up.  I'm like, it's like hours after the electricity went out.  It's just about to get dark.  I go, where the fuck are you?  We're downtown having margaritas.  Everybody's I was a get the fuck out.  You fucking walk up the West Side Highway and meet me at the fucking corner.  Wow.  Two hours.  Just have a little fun.  As soon as as soon as there's no caps.  As soon as the lights went out, people girls are starting to get attacked by people. 
[01:30:30]  And yeah, you couldn't see in front of your face.  You can't.  It was a big, great time.  It was.  It was.  It was.  For alcoholics, it was.  There was a weird sense of people helping each other out.  But again, by day three, it would have been.  It was like how long was it?  24 hours or a little more?  24 hours.  Around 24 hours.  And you started to think, like, as I was looking up, because I was on the 22nd floor and it  was in Jersey, too.  I was like, you start to think, like, it's not coming back.  Like, you forget.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, oh, my God, I'm not going to get it back.  The people on the 38th floor, if we didn't get it back, you're going to have to walk 30. 
[01:31:00]  Your apartment, your penthouse, you have to.  You're the only one.  I'm on the fifth.  I can manage that.  There's no fucking elevator going to take you up that high, right?  I was on the 22nd floor and I would just walk.  It was fucking awful.  Oh, God.  There was people in the stairwell going, because they didn't have flashlights, and people would  go up with, I had a candle.  They'd be like, what floor are you going to?  Do you mind walking me?  I'm on the 28th.  I'm like, I'm on the fifth.  I'll walk you up five.  And they'd walk up five.  And they'd just keep going because you couldn't see in the hallways.  Now, all the buildings in New York, because of that outage, they have those strips. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  Emergency lighting.  Yeah, that's one day.  You're fucking, it's done.  Yeah, after, once the battery goes out.  I'm going, I'm stealing a fucking moped and I'm going right to your house.  Yes.  A lot of people are going to be coming up by my house and I'll be picking them off from  my window.  I can't share.  I went to Ant's house during the blackout, the most recent one.  And he had like little lights set up in the house.  Generators running out back.  But we had to power back first.  Yeah, but here's the thing.  That would suck to make it all the way to Ant's house on a Vespa and then you just take me 
[01:32:00]  out.  Oh, man.  Oops.  Well, sorry, Bobby.  I don't got enough food and shelter and everything else.  I just wake up.  I'm half, I'm half alive, half dead.  Someone's giving me CPR.  You're going, ah, it's Bobby.  No one's going, fuck him.  Who gives a fuck?  Exactly.  I'll just be looking at the crying Vespa.  He'd be looking at the, he'd be looking at the food.  There's not enough food.  Fuck him.  Everybody would show up like it was one of your parties.  And I brought a water purifying tablets.  I'd be going karaoke. 
[01:32:30]  Woo.  Yeah.  Motherfucker.  The, the, the, uh, uh, the thought of having a complete breakdown like that, uh, and, and  having to get shelter and, and food and stuff.  People always speculate.  They're like, Oh, what would you do?  What do you need?  What do you got in your go bag?  And shit like that.  It's like, I really think that guns kind of win.  You know, I am hungry.  Not right.  They have food and no guns.  Not right.  I will take their food.  Well, yeah, but not right away. 
[01:33:00]  That would, for it to break down, not day one.  Yeah.  I mean, it would take a while for that day one.  You start pulling out guns and the lights come back on.  You're arrested.  Then you realize someone just turned the lights off.  Oh, that's all it was.  You blew a fuse.  You're shooting the neighbors.  Yeah, exactly.  Raping their children.  It's not the end of the world.  What are you doing?  Thursday.  It wasn't a solo flare.  The building got fucked up.  Yeah, exactly.  They just unplugged it.  There was a sign in the lobby.  That's the end of the world.  Off my wife.  You kicked your fan out, stupid. 
[01:33:30]  Hey, shit.  You have a plan, though, now?  I got a plan.  We get cash ready to go.  I mean, you know.  By the way, now I know what I'm looking for next time I'm at Bobby.  Exactly.  That fucking load of cash.  I'm in the bathroom for an hour and a half.  I'll be right up.  He probably has some awful hiding spot, like the inside of his shoe that he thinks nobody  will look in.  Oh, yeah, no one's going to look there.  Nobody will look in his shoe.  It's a clog.  There's your wallet.  I forget.  I got nothing.  And you don't have, like, a go bag or anything? 
[01:34:00]  I have a couple weapons.  I got a couple weapons.  I got a knife.  Well, that's not even a weapon.  The knife is to actually fucking survive.  Cut the cheese.  And make a lean-to.  Lean-to.  You need a lean-8.  See?  It's big.  I actually, I loved it.  I'm sorry, Bobby.  I had to try not to laugh at it.  What's the lean-to?  Oh, my God.  I don't know what it is.  You know who's going to die?  He's so dead.  I was just thinking the same thing.  He's fucking dead.  He's going to suck cock in the park. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  They find Jimmy rolled up dead in the fetal position in front of the comedy cellar.  God damn it.  Both of these fucking idiots are dead.  They're both dead.  Both of them are fucking dead.  No, I would just hook up with smart people and fucking hang out with them and make them laugh.  Yeah.  Give me some water.  I'm like, dude, dude, Beatles songs, interpretation.  Yeah.  Dancing.  Listen, Meg Ryan chin and this fucking asshole, I'll fuck it as soon as it's done.  If you have to ask what's a lean-to, that's kind of, yeah.  I don't know what it is.  I don't know how to make fire out of my own piss. 
[01:35:00]  Listen to me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I will get into Anthony's base before you will because I will go in and get shit-faced  with this man and have a good time with him.  Here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  We've got to drown our sorrows.  I'll have my own base.  I'll be gone.  And when Anthony fucking finally loses it and he gets that fucking crazy king disease  where he just starts killing his own people.  Like Colonel Kurtz.  Yeah.  You'll be fucking dead.  Joe DeRosa's head rolls into your lap.  Yeah.  I just wanted to see what it would look like off his body. 
[01:35:30]  On the spice in front of my house.  How do you get it back on?  I can't get it back on.  Oh, that doesn't go back on.  King disease.  Oh, that's right.  I got this on my little keychain thing that I got.  What is that?  You know what that is?  That makes fire.  Yeah, fire.  Yeah, fire.  Yeah, you pick shavings of this and then you strike it on the flint because fire.  How do you get shavings of it?  You take a knife.  It's very soft metal.  Yeah.  And you scrape it with a knife and go and it makes little shavings.  And then when you make a spark on it, it goes. 
[01:36:00]  And kindling.  Kindling.  It's like 2,000 degrees.  Yeah.  You can make fire on a pistol.  You can put it in a bag as long as you're not dehydrated.  If it's not yet, put it in a bag.  Let the sun hit it.  The sun goes through, makes the magnifying glass and you can point it into some.  Some kinlin.  That sounds like a lot tougher than this.  Who's got a clear bag with him at all times?  If I was a tie, you could fire one.  But Norton, he tried to fucking drink it.  Just pour it over my face.  Did you drink the fire again, Norton? 
[01:36:30]  At least I ain't pissing on my pants or something.  Oh, God, Chip.  So what else can you do?  Yeah, that's pretty good.  I have two weapons.  I have a knife.  What's a lean-to?  A lean-to is a shelter.  So you get two.  It's just a flat surface that goes on an angle.  I know the name.  I know what that is.  Where do you have your lean-to? 
[01:37:00]  I've built one before.  I went out into the woods of Maine with this fucking psychopath.  What a dick he called.  A lean-to.  Fuck you.  In a hotel.  What, are the fucking rooms going to fall out of the building?  I don't care if it's fucking got no lights.  Go sleep in a building, a fucking hotel.  Yeah, you got your lean-to, your app, your flint.  I love this.  What would you do?  I hope the first day he does that, a bear kills him.  We're saying if it all goes to shit, Jimmy.  Who cares?  I don't care if I die if it all goes to shit. 
[01:37:30]  Wow.  Let it.  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, who wants to live in, like, the road?  You know what I mean?  Who wants to live like that?  It'd be fun for a little while, anyway.  I wouldn't mind fucking...  It's like a video game.  Yeah, you would mind.  Back in the day?  No, I fucking...  I love camping and shit like that.  Yeah, the first time you ate a pussy that hadn't been showered until we'd shit,  be like, oh, I'm electricity rolled.  I miss fucking water on these things.  Hot water.  Yeah, what the fuck?  I ate a girl's ass, and you smell that onion-y fucking pike itself.  Oh, come on.  It's got to be great.  It smells like fucking the purple onions.  I keep the...  That's really gross. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  Rebuild civilization with that nasty pussy.  I've spent the night in the woods.  You ever go camping?  Yeah.  Did you ever go camping?  I hate camping.  Yeah.  Can you wait till I finish before you fucking ask the next person?  Oh, man.  You ever go camping, guy?  You ever go camping?  Exactly.  I'm saying the same words.  My crocklet group over here.  Go!  Go!  I don't want to get fucking slow.  Yeah, I don't want to hear it.  Well, I'm trying to think if I had, yeah.  He bored me right with it. 
[01:38:30]  Nah, one time.  Yeah.  Who'd you go camping with?  I don't act interested.  I don't know if it was ever real camping.  I was in the yard.  Someone's yard.  Oh, no.  In the yard.  Yeah.  With the sliding glass door open just in case you need snacks.  Mom!  Mom!  We're camping out here.  Can you make us grilled cheese?  That's camping.  Camping.  Yeah, camping's pretty fun, man.  I mean, I don't know if I've ever done it outside of a camp. 
[01:39:00]  I think I've done it in tents.  Yeah?  Yeah, I've camped in tents.  Like, but out in the fucking woods or a campground?  No, on a campground.  No.  Where there's trees and shit.  Out in the middle of nowhere.  I've done it.  I've done a lean-to out in the middle of nowhere.  That was fucking bullshit.  Yeah.  Yeah, sleeping by a fire.  You wake up with that, like, fucking, your sinuses are all fucked up.  Your clothes just smell like a fucking arsonist.  You get a headache because of it, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  We went in the Mojave Desert and camped, and it was blazing hot in the day and literally 
[01:39:30]  freezing at night where the water would freeze.  Yeah.  And you have to bring your own water in with you.  Why would you do that?  Because it was, I don't know, I guess I was a kid at the time.  I was like 12, 13, 14 during those years.  And my dad would go with his buddies, and we would just all load up pickup trucks and  doom buggies and guns and go out in the middle of the Mojave Desert and camp for like 10 days.  It's all making sense now.  Yes, yes, it is.  I never heard the back story.  That was like seeing a prequel. 
[01:40:00]  It's crazy.  You wake up, and it was so fucking cold, and you'd have to like wash, and the water was  frozen.  It was fucking, you'd have to break like a little layer of ice, and it was cold.  Then there was a, we used to play in an abandoned mine shaft, a silver and turquoise mine in the  middle of the Mojave, and that was like what we did.  We'd climb up these big fucking mountains that were there, where there were just snakes 
[01:40:30]  underneath the rocks.  Did you ever get bit?  No, I never got bit by a snake.  I was lucky that way.  But then we would find like old, there was old shit everywhere, like from the early 1900s,  old mining carts.  And then we found these old, this old stove, and one of the kids that were there also took  a, took an aerosol can and just sprayed the whole can inside the stove, and then threw  a match in it, and the fire, like just blew out right into his face and burnt his, he 
[01:41:00]  had no more eyebrows, and his hair was singed, and we're all just laughing at him.  It's in the middle of nowhere.  I like how the kid was like, this abandoned mine shaft isn't dangerous enough for my taste.  Not dangerous enough.  And then we would all just jump in the dune buggy and drive, and it was kids driving,  fucking like, like I said, early teens, driving a dune buggy.  With other kids holding on to the roll bar with guns, like Rat Patrol, just fucking  shooting anything that moved.  That's a fucking blast.  Anything that fucking moved. 
[01:41:30]  If a poor jackrabbit got in the way, or a lizard.  And with all those stupid shows on now, where they find shit that's worth like a million  dollars.  Oh, yeah, I know.  All that shit you were, that stove's probably fucking half a million.  Yeah.  We used to walk on the train tracks and find something called date nails.  They were these nails that they put in the railroad ties every like 10 ties or so, with  the last two digits of the date that the track was laid.  And some of them were like 25, like 1925, and a few of them were the 1800s.  And you used to try to collect all the date nails, and I don't know if there's any collection. 
[01:42:00]  I don't even know why I'm telling you this story.  It's delicious, like big nuggets or something.  No, they were.  But that was like another collector's item thing.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, there was so much like old fucking Coke cans and old like oil cans, just like shit  from the early 1900s when that mine was actually being worked.  And then this guy, Charlie Reyes, bought it and thought it would be a great place to  take the family camping until he shot his son.  I've told that story. 
[01:42:30]  We were out there, and a gun went off, and his son got shot in the shoulder, and we  were in the middle of nowhere, and they had to load him up in the pickup truck and drive  How far of a drive?  It was 50 miles off the highway in between Barstow, California, and Needles, Arizona.  Jesus.  Needles?  Yeah.  It was in the middle of fucking nowhere.  The Old Woman Mountains.  That's what they were called?  Yeah, yeah.  It was scary as fuck.  And then the cops had to show up to take a police report because it was a gunshot.  They showed up hours and hours later, and it was pitch black, and they showed up, and 
[01:43:00]  they were fucking petrified.  They came up with their guns out, flashlights going, I want everyone out of that shack.  Because they didn't know there's a gunshot.  They thought, like, Manson was out there or something.  It was just, no one should be there.  Yeah.  Very close.  Did you see Wes Craven shooting movies?  Yeah, I was there.  It was pretty, it got pretty creepy at night.  I got, I did that wood shit in Maine, the middle of fucking Maine, and I went with this 
[01:43:30]  kid.  Rich kid.  Really rich kid.  And he said, oh, I got, my family's got a house up.  Yeah.  What were you like?  My bodyguard fucking Phillip Peach took you?  He said, what was his name?  What do you want, help?  Say it, stupid.  No, the kid's name.  He wants help smashing me.  What was his name?  Stop it.  Clifford Peach.  Clifford.  Clifford Peach.  Yeah.  He took me out to the woods.  It was a shack.  It wasn't a house.  I thought it would be like a palatial fucking nice place in Maine.  It was a shack with no heat. 
[01:44:00]  Then he took me way out in the woods with this broad too, sexy broad.  And we went out, we went out to the woods in the middle of the night, something was coming.  Like he was a fire and us in the middle of the woods and you heard something coming  like those footsteps.  Yeah.  Crack, crack.  And he got fucked up.  And he had a 30 odd six and I had a shotgun.  Oh.  And yeah, but it doesn't matter.  I, I would, I never shot a fucking head.  You should put toothpaste on it.  Brush your teeth.  I didn't get it. 
[01:44:30]  I love that.  Shot yourself in the head.  See?  I got it.  Toothpaste on it.  Brush your teeth with it.  That's hilarious.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  What happened?  So you're in the woods, you hear a crickling noise.  Mean Jimmy, mean Jimmy, sorry you fucking likes being mean.  Sorry you two mows with guns, you hear a fucking deer walking and you're both panicked.  Mean Jimmy.  What's the use of having guns in the woods?  Really?  If you were in the woods in the middle of the night in Maine and you heard fucking cracking,  what's that, what's that, what's that, what's that.  I would not cut my gun and go, what's up, yo? 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  That's what you do.  I'd sit there like Charlie Sheen in Platoon.  Yeah.  Just kind of looking through your fucking hood.  Yeah.  I'd be like Gardner.  Piece of shit.  No, it's what happened.  Nothing.  Exactly.  Come on.  Exactly.  I'm done.  That's why I handled it well.  You heard the footsteps.  You know when Jimmy has nine more, well, so what's going on?  Tell me more.  Keep going.  Fuck you.  You're hanging yourself.  Go fuck yourself, no neck.  Bobby ended up shooting some prowling queen in the forest.  Just looking to go get fucking laid in the bushes. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, they were 15 yards from a fucking public parking lot.  Two guys trying to suck each other.  We weren't in Maine.  We're here between Connecticut and Rhode Island.  We had two guys trying to suck each other.  We had two other guys trying to do it.  What did you do, wait until the girl fell asleep?  Girl.  Did I say girl?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, dude.  I can't come unless your hand's on my head, dude.  Dude, come on. 
[01:46:00]  Hold my head.  Make me take it.  Hold my head.  Stop fucking pawning your shit off on me.  Stop it.  We know what you're doing.  Bob doesn't like the creepy details of him being sexually assaulted.  No, because I know it's what he does.  But yeah, I can't come unless you push my head down, sir.  No, it's like, oh.  So you're thinking, oh, Jimmy can't come unless.  No, it's just a mirror.  Bob didn't like when I talked about making him eat cum.  No, I didn't like cum eater.  Laugh and cum out of my hand.  I don't like cum eater. 
[01:46:30]  That just fucking grosses me out.  Yeah, he said, you're a cum eater.  I was like, I almost fucking, I almost wanted to bite him on that one.  Yeah, of course.  It made you hungry.  That's just not good.  That's just.  There's nothing funny about it.  There is.  In order to come up with that thought, you had to actually eat a puddle of cum out of somebody's  hand.  Like if I had cum in my hand and I'd point at it and I'd say, yeah, we know what you  did.  Clean.  Did you say clean?  Clean my palm, bitch.  He's using technical fucking terms now. 
[01:47:00]  Clean my palm.  He's using technical.  Yeah.  Lick all the nooks and crannies.  He's using inside of fucking knowledge.  And then I just pictured, beyond the cum, I just pictured the way the palm would taste.  It's like that sweaty, salty palm taste.  Jesus Christ.  What fucking details are that?  I went all the way with it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It smells like it's not.  Oh, there's a gross.  There are.  Have you ever gone down on a girl after you've shut a load in her? 
[01:47:30]  No.  I wouldn't talk to her after that.  Go towel out, you fucking hole.  I don't mean, but I don't mean like digging in and fucking, you know, like a fucking.  It smells like fucking cauliflower.  You smell cauliflower.  It's it's got a it's got a hint of jizz smell to it.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Smell.  I've never noticed.  Absolute fucking.  I've noticed bleach and I've noticed those cum plants that you pointed out.  Yep.  The jizz trees.  And they're coming back right now.  They're in blue.  You don't like them? 
[01:48:00]  I hate them.  And the cauliflower.  I don't like.  I cook it.  I can't have it when she's cooked before she cooks it because it smells like fucking jizz.  I think it smells like like fucking gas.  Smells like jizz.  Get cauliflower and fucking.  It smells like fucking.  Could you could you lick your own cream pie out?  What's that?  Can you come at a girl and suck it out?  No, no, no.  Yeah.  I've delicately diddled the clit with my tongue after blowing a load, but not.  It stinks.  Not.  I'm dug in.  I won't give it like the gusto like I do beforehand. 
[01:48:30]  I actually put my chin on the top of the pussy and flick down on the clit like.  Using your chin as a blockade.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I don't like the fucking when you after you fuck a pussy, it's got the consistency  of like squid.  It's like Sly Stallone's mouth.  It's just kind of.  It's not symmetrical anymore.  It's all beat up.  It's like boiled.  Yeah.  Boiled California.  Yeah.  It's got that rubbery.  It's been.  It's like swollen. 
[01:49:00]  Leftover eggplant parmesan.  Oh, my God.  You don't like when the white stuff is on your dick?  That yeast smell?  Oh, God.  What?  That makes me sick when they cream like that.  I'm like, ugh.  You don't like that?  No.  It's fucking gross.  I don't like anything to do with that.  I hate when the jizz dribbles down into the butthole.  Makes like a little fucking, like the bitch's eye.  Where's the eye?  From the Beastmaster.  What was it?  Clash of the Titans.  Clash of the Titans.  Give us the eye!  You know what the eye used to be? 
[01:49:30]  That's what it looks like.  Because it goes down.  It goes down in a thin stream.  Bobby's right.  It goes down in a thin stream.  And then it widens at the bunghole.  It's disgusting.  Yeah, it's gross.  Yeah, it's really gross.  And then it actually highlights the fucking, the awfulness of her asshole.  Awfulness?  Yeah, it's a wonderful place.  It's a magical place.  You like asshole?  Yes!  I'm not talking to you, you homo.  We know you like asshole.  I'm talking to a fucking guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Nice girl's nice ass like that. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  That's a big right in.  I hooked up with this Irish girl once, and she was a waitress at a comedy club, and she  was foul.  She was great.  She was blowing me, and she's going, I want you to come all over my tits, and then rub  it in.  I want you to chisel all over my tits, and then rub it in.  Is it your laugh?  I'm doing a terrible, I'm doing like an Australian accent.  Yeah.  You're doing Duncan McLeod from McLean McLeod.  And I'm like, come on my breast, Highlander.  There can only be one load on my asshole.  Yeah.  And I was so into it, I'm like, you fucking, you dirty fucking, and as soon as I came, it 
[01:50:30]  was like the worst thing I've ever had to do.  It immediately, cum immediately got cold, and you're just rubbing, you're not turned on  anymore.  Oh, no.  You're just rubbing cold cum into a girl's tits.  Oh, God.  It was awful.  It was like when you play that Halloween game, when you're blindfolded, you're going  to put your hand in a bowl, and they go, ooh, it's eyeballs, or whatever.  That's literally what it felt like.  It's intestines.  Just cold.  Trying to help her cum.  I always put the chick to cum first, but as soon as I cum, I am completely finished with 
[01:51:00]  this.  Useless.  There's nothing worse when a girl, I had this girl a long time ago in Vegas, smoking,  like way out of my league, but she liked me for some reason.  She came up to my room, she takes her clothes off.  And I'm trying not to cum.  I'm trying not to cum, but it didn't work.  She kept doing that shit, like backing up into it, and I just blew my load.  And it came out just, and I was like, and I didn't even feel the orgasm. 
[01:51:30]  It just dribbled out.  And then she was like, it's okay, baby.  I'll make you do it again.  I go, good luck, bitch.  Oh, no.  And she sat on top of me, and she's trying to push my mushy dick into her pussy.  Oh, she's using finger splints.  Yeah.  Make it hard between two fingers.  Yeah, like she was a fucking magician.  Like, hang on, if I can just get it in here.  Like one of those balloons you make balloon animals with.  If you squeeze the bottom enough, the top will get full of air enough where you might  be able to work it. 
[01:52:00]  It's still mushy.  I'm one and done.  It's still mushy.  One and done, baby.  As soon as I blow my load, you can call it fucking quits.  Do you have a recovery time, though, where it's not like 24 hours?  Yeah, it's fucking next week.  Exactly.  Yeah, a new face.  Right.  Exactly.  A whole new pussy.  Oh, shit.  It is incredible.  It never ceases to amaze me.  The fucking extreme, immediate contradiction.  Like, right up until the moment I'm going to cum, I'm like, I'm going to fuck this  chick three times a night. 
[01:52:30]  Like, every fucking time I take it.  And as soon as I cum, I'm like, do you care if I go to the couch?  I just, can I just say, what's on TV?  Yeah, nothing.  Their voices go from, yeah, baby, I want to make you cum to, what are we going to  watch?  We want to get something to eat?  Get the fuck out of my life.  Once I cum, if a girl touches me, I feel like I'm being molested.  Yes.  That's what it feels like to be molested.  It's like, don't stop, respect my body.  But it, but it is, it's from, I think it is from some fucking fucked up sexual shit 
[01:53:00]  that happened when you were a kid.  Yeah, you shouldn't feel molested when you, when you fuck somebody.  Well, I agree with that.  Exactly, I know exactly what he's saying.  There are times where you're just kind of like, I just want to fucking watch TV.  Yeah, because you're being punched by someone.  And she's laying on your chest and grabbing your soft dick and you're like, will you fucking  cut it out?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's intimacy.  You don't like the fucking, it's like her kiss after I blow my load is like acid.  The saliva is still on my cheek and the wind will hit it. 
[01:53:30]  And I can feel right where her fucking shitty thin lips were.  And I just want to fucking scrape it off with a knife.  Get the fuck.  There's the time period between when you cum and when you're actually able to go and play  that video game and not get in huge trouble.  Yeah.  Like you can't just cum and go right to the.  I thought you meant the time period where you want to do it.  I was like, what?  No, no, that's instant.  As I'm coming, I'm hitting that center button on the Xbox controller.  Level up.  You're hearing the Xbox startup music.  Whoa. 
[01:54:00]  No, you got a compliment on the way out the door.  You compliment on the way into the living room.  You're like, oh, fuck.  That was real.  Oh, my God.  I'm just going to go out and that was fucking amazing.  And then just close the door and let her land.  You're like a pig.  That'd be a great app.  A great app would be get me out of this where you've said it, where your phone rings and  it's just a guy in the back.  We need to talk right now.  And it's an emergency.  And you just put it on speakerphone.  All right.  I'll be right there.  Yeah.  And you get out of bed.  You're able to get out of bed.  Yeah.  But you're at your house. 
[01:54:30]  You know what?  The same guy calls a minute later.  Nothing, nothing worse than fucking blowing a load and realizing what the illusion just  falls away.  It's over, Johnny.  It just falls away.  It's so easy to see behind the curtain.  Oh, it's terrible.  I can't get them out fast.  If a girl said to me, like, if I came on, look, I'm not even going to wipe this off.  I'm just putting my shirt on and getting the fuck out.  I'd be like, oh, I'm glad you stopped over.  I would never go, no, no, go ahead and clean yourself.  Yeah.  I agree.  If I could fuck a girl on a skydiving plane, as soon as I come, just kick her out. 
[01:55:00]  No shoot.  That's why prostitutes people, why would you have to go with a prostitute?  I want to fuck.  I want to feel an orgasm.  I want to feel loved.  And then I want you to leave.  I want you to get the fuck out of here.  Wow.  As soon as they're gone, prostitutes are great.  All right, take it easy.  Gone.  No intimacy, huh?  None.  Unless it's before.  Fake intimacy.  See what you're kissing.  Fake intimacy is the best. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  Pretending that you love each other, soft kissing, all that shit.  And then you blow your load and you're done.  Yeah.  There's nothing worse than after you blow your load.  You want to go get disco fries at the diner?  Ugh.  No.  You don't ask for food after I come, idiots.  Jesus Christ.  I love that.  Are you planning to go get something to eat, then you want to fuck in them first?  Are you still going to get something to eat?  It's like, nah, shit.  Are you joking?  There's some bread in the fucking kitchen.  I got some brie cheese from a party I went to. 
[01:56:00]  I don't want to go get something to eat.  Fucking blueberry.  You don't like just laying there and watching TV or something?  Joking around a little?  I like that.  I like a little like we're throwing a Twilight Zone DVD.  Right, right.  Some old school good fucking show.  It depends on the girl.  Right, exactly.  Some girls I want to boot right out.  Some girls I'm like, no, I want to lay and cuddle.  But those, you know.  Oh, fuck them.  I hate the ones that want to fuck around again.  Yeah, that sucks.  And they start playing with you.  Like 20 minutes later, they start playing with your dick again. 
[01:56:30]  Ooh.  Sometimes that's fine, though.  Fuck that.  Get away from me.  It's not happening.  New girl?  I need like a day or two to fucking.  If it's the same girl, yeah.  I got to rejuvenate.  First time with the girl.  First time ever.  Very excited.  It's great.  And then that's it for like 48 hours.  Who do you think I'm banging?  Megan Fox?  Yeah.  Yeah, these chicks.  I'm banging girl versions of myself.  Yeah.  These chicks.  Jamie Foxx. 
[01:57:00]  Exactly.  Yeah.  We're not fucking talking about hot chicks.  We're talking about chicks.  Yeah.  We're fucking a German shepherd mole under her eyelash.  German shepherd mole?  Yeah.  She's got a fucking missing fucking front tooth.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, dude.  Yeah, we're not talking about smoking chicks.  We're talking about chicks that are hot.  And then when you bust your load, you can see their face changes.  It's like the...  It really is like the Ender Raiders of the Lost Ark. 
[01:57:30]  Where that fucking beautiful thing turns into a demon.  It's beautiful.  Stuff's screaming and your face melts.  Great.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Yeah, the shit that you thought was hot before.  And then right when it happened, you're like, oh, God.  Look at that fucking...  Her quirky smile turns into a buck-toothed bitch.  Yeah.  Is that it?  That stupid fucking eyelid that doesn't open.  Her Joe eyes turn into...  Or what are they called?  Slow eyes? 
[01:58:00]  When they're at half-mast and now they look like mongoloid.  It's like, wait, was that attractive?  I thought you just looked sleepy, but I guess your mother drank while she was pregnant.  I don't know.  Yeah, the breath always stinks after you blow your load.  Always.  Always just stinks.  I had to go with flu breath blowing me all the time.  Fucking...  How do you not know you have flu breath?  Oh, that's disgusting.  What the fuck is...  What is...  What is...  What is...  It's a putrid, sick, sweet smell.  It's a wet smell. 
[01:58:30]  That's disgusting.  I know exactly what you mean.  Flu breath.  That's fucking disgusting.  Did you make out with her?  No.  No.  I made out with a girl after she puked.  Oh, Anthony.  It was...  I was...  She was like...  It was high school.  What got her to...  Oh, okay.  It was high school, though.  So I was...  I wouldn't give a shit, you know?  I didn't care at all.  I was all revved up.  I bought her some wine.  I think she was 15.  I was like 16.  26.  Yeah, I was...  It was last week.  She was 15.  And we got our hands on some wine, and she wouldn't stop just chugging it. 
[01:59:00]  And then we're, like, making out, and she's like...  She just starts puking out the door of the truck.  And then she fucking, like, just kind of spits a few times.  And then she just comes right back to making out.  And I wasn't...  I was not...  Oh, you mean right after she puked.  16?  I wasn't even gonna fucking...  Did it stink?  Oh, yeah.  It was like I was fucking licking up vomit. 
[01:59:30]  It was terrible.  I haven't done that.  But I could...  No, you know what?  How often did you get laid at 16?  And it was gearing up to be laid.  A lot.  I'm not talking about people fucking you.  A lot.  I've had both.  I did both, you fucking little pussy.  Bobby never got pussy.  Bobby was a plump, tiny little fella.  I was banging a lot.  I got plenty of pussy, but it was like...  It was usually some type of relationship.  Oh, fuck relationships.  I did most of my drinking between 10 and 15.  I got so much box.  If you had relationships, it was called stepson. 
[02:00:00]  He didn't rape me.  Jesus, don't say that.  That was alleged.  He put the word alleged.  I don't know.  Like, just...  There's very few 16-year-olds that at that point would go,  Oh, man.  No, I'm not gonna fucking kiss you.  Like, you just...  You continue where you left off, hoping to get laid.  But, like, it's true.  There's a lot of 16-year-olds that go,  Beating you, bad breath, bitch.  No, fuck.  Get out of here.  Hold on.  This is the thing. 
[02:00:30]  Why are you standing up?  I don't know.  I gotta keep moving up and down.  The, uh...  Just like an elevator or something?  I'm a mover, baby.  I'm a mover.  What is this, your morning zoo show?  Hang on.  Sit down like the rest of us.  You're making me nervous.  I just stand up for a second.  Here's the thing.  Like, what...  Okay.  Listen to me.  He really does lose his shit when he sits down.  Sit back up.  Stand up.  Sit back up.  Like, I would get at 16 if you were like,  She puked and then she chewed some gum  and I was able to get over the thought that she puked 
[02:01:00]  and it didn't taste like puke.  Being 16 doesn't alleviate your fucking gag reflex  when you taste puke in your mouth.  You're so fucking revved up.  She still had it in her teeth when she was kissing you.  Whatever.  Pieces of corn and fucking...  Whatever.  As long as my dick went in there later.  What would you rather do?  Puke or your own jizz?  My own jizz.  My own jizz.  Jizz is fast.  Two fucking fairies.  My own jizz.  My own jizz.  Some other guy's jizz.  Some jizz. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, it wasn't a choice.  They just said jizz.  Jizz.  Would you drink your own cup out of a glass?  My own cup out of a glass?  Really?  You're fucking...  What the fucking...  What's wrong with you today?  You're fucking...  Are you tired?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Would I drink my own jizz out of a cup?  Again, specific Jim.  Yeah, yeah.  He knows exactly.  He sure does.  Would you do it?  What kind of cup, Jim?  No, I mean...  A Planet Hollywood glass.  Dumb Planet Hollywood glass. 
[02:02:00]  Have you ever done that?  Look at me.  Have you ever...  Have you ever...  Fucking took a shot of your own jizz?  I've hit myself in the mouth by accident while I was jerking off out of the eye.  With your jizz.  Not somebody...  Yeah.  We're talking about her jizz.  By himself, he means another guy.  No.  No.  No.  Yeah, her sundress didn't come up in time.  So...  I've never tasted it.  Ever.  Never tasted your own jizz?  I got it in my eye once.  I shot myself in the eye. 
[02:02:30]  It fucking burns like a motherfucker.  Sorry about that.  But I never got it in my mouth.  Huh.  I would teach things.  Practice makes perfect.  Yeah.  Stretch.  Yeah.  Have you ever done it?  No.  Just like I said, like diddling a clit there with your tongue after you blow your load.  You kind of do pick up what that fucking shit tastes like.  What is that fucking that pussy smell?  What is that smell?  Like, I mean, every pussy has that smell.  It's like a...  Disgusting.  It's like a...  It's like a...  Like a foot...  A foot? 
[02:03:00]  What is that smell?  It's like a sweaty...  What are you going out with?  It's a sweaty...  Makes me mad.  When a pussy smells, it makes me angry.  How do you get really mad?  It makes me angry.  And I won't go down.  I do a test.  What I do is I finger her.  That's good.  And I slide my...  When we're making out, I'm fingering her.  And I slide my hand up her back and I put it on her shoulder like this.  And I kiss her neck.  And as I'm doing that, I sniff my fingers.  Does your fucking clothes fall off because her pussy has acid in it?  I just shove litmus paper in there and do a pH test.  I have a friend.  Do you want to hold on two seconds, miss, while I mix these chemicals? 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  If you get your deodorant, if you rub your finger under your armpit and put it in her pussy and she screams.  Oh, shit.  No, I'm kidding.  Don't do that.  I wouldn't do that.  They're all going to scream.  I have a friend that claimed, and he will not...  No, you don't.  It's a good point.  All right.  I know a guy.  He won't break on it.  I've known this guy for 10 fucking years.  He swears to me.  He dated a girl that had such a bad case of vaginosis or whatever the fuck it's called.  Vaginosis.  Vaginosis.  That it ate through her genes.  No way. 
[02:04:00]  And for 10 years I've gone, that's not possible.  And he swears to me in a way that I'm like, it must have fucking happened.  Did he go down her?  He said he did once.  He said it was awful.  Don't let her fuck her tissue, her skin up.  Hang on.  That's what I kept saying.  But I say all this, and he's a very trustworthy, reliable guy, and I say all these things to  him.  He doesn't lie.  He doesn't exaggerate.  And he's, in fact, a very private person.  When I bring this up, though, he goes, I swear to God.  And he looks at me like he's telling me...  That's where the seagulls were pecking. 
[02:04:30]  He said it was like the worst thing ever.  He just said it was like the...  He said it was unbearably fucking bad.  I used the...  Yeah, he said it was his girlfriend, and he really cared about her, so it was hard for  him to break away.  So he tried to...  Did he tell her about it?  No, but he said he eventually broke up with her, and he was like...  He said that was the reason.  He was like, I couldn't...  He kept squirting alcohol in her pussy.  Did she know it stunk? 
[02:05:00]  I don't know.  I never asked him that.  I don't think she did.  I dated a girl once, like, for a while that had a really smelly box.  Wow.  And I...  What do you say, dude?  You can't be like your pussy smells.  You could...  You might have to, though.  Sorry.  You're like, look, you either shoot something about this, or I'm removing myself from your  life.  I had a girl go down on me.  She's one of the hottest chicks I've ever been with.  Stripper broad.  She would...  Her box stunk.  Just fucking stunk.  And she went down on me after fucking me a little bit, and she went, ugh. 
[02:05:30]  And I was like, it's not me.  Wow.  And she was like, I know.  I go, well, fix it.  Because I don't even want to fucking be near it anymore.  Smoking hot.  One of the hottest chicks I've ever been with.  She went, ew?  Yeah.  Because she smelled her own pussy on my dick.  You know what I mean?  Ew.  But it wasn't me.  She knew that, but he had to rub it in.  Wow.  It's not me.  It wasn't me, you fucking dirty whore.  Yeah.  Stop rubbing your box in that fucking pole.  You smell like you've been catching fucking halibut in Seattle. 
[02:06:00]  Pelican pussy.  Bitch has dead flies in her snatch.  Bad fucking vaginosis.  I'm using that ball stuff.  I get fresh balls.  I put it on today.  Oh, God.  I will fucking swear by this shit.  Wow.  I love it.  It's deodorant for your balls.  I don't need it.  I don't need it either, but I put it on, and it fucking keeps you dry and nice, and your  nuts smell fucking awesome all day.  Do you have it on today?  All day long.  Do you have it on today?  Yeah, I have it all day.  Yeah.  I got mine on. 
[02:06:30]  Look at you, too.  What the fuck?  No.  Can I get it?  No.  Look at it.  Oh, I guess we're all filthy balls, Jim.  My balls almost never stink.  No.  You got to scrub them.  That's because you have to scrub the DNA off you fucking twice a day.  Scrub them down.  No, my balls stunk one time really bad when I was a teenager.  Why?  He wants to do a small...  I want to smell his balls.  I'm wearing the same shit.  I want to see if it works.  We've been talking about this.  You made Norton grossed out.  Rub your fingers. 
[02:07:00]  Do the old back of the pointer finger test between your leg and...  Oh, God.  That's a bad spot.  Between the leg and the balls.  No, I'm not doing it.  Oh, you're doing it.  I'm not doing it now.  I'll do it.  I'll smell it.  All right.  Now, Bobby's going to rub his finger between his ball bag and his thigh.  If you drop trowel, I will smell your balls.  You got to do it.  Jimmy!  I'm going to take out...  Holy shit!  I'm going to take out my...  I'm going to take out my bubblegum.  One ball.  From my...  Pull a ball out. 
[02:07:30]  I'm going to take out the bubblegum.  Oh, God.  I love watching Sam run to the curds.  It's one of my favorite things.  Like the fucking execution going on in here.  It might be.  Yeah, that's true.  I got to see these awful balls.  I got big saggy nuts today.  Do you?  Today?  Come on.  Get him out.  What are you doing?  He's so excited about it.  Stop screaming at me, you fucking homo.  You like that fucking thing in the carnival that grabs a fucking stuffed animal?  Grab your balls, you asshole.  Trying to get...  Yeah.  I'm trying to get...  Oh, I wish you were on fire right now. 
[02:08:00]  Let me see.  All right.  Oh, God.  There's his big fucking brain.  Ew!  Now, DeRosa is...  There we go.  Ready?  Take a nice woof.  DeRosa's going to take a little...  Take a nice woof.  Don't get my balls in it, though.  Because then you won't be able to put it.  Shut up.  I hate pushing it.  I hate pushing it.  You, dude, come on.  Dude, come on.  Ah!  That made...  I got it.  Come on.  Go, go, go.  Go, go, go.  Hold on.  Go, go.  You keep pushing it into his face. 
[02:08:30]  I'm pushing...  Stop doing it.  I'm filling up.  Jimmy's pushing him.  I'm getting...  My dick is filling up.  Stop it.  Hang on.  I'm just going to...  Here we go.  Ready?  Smell his balls.  Did you get a whiff or no?  No.  Yeah.  I know.  That's the nut right there.  Oh!  Smell good, right?  I keep trying to push Bob in a Joe's nose.  What is balls smell like?  Was it good?  They smell really good.  Yeah?  This stuff is... 
[02:09:00]  Fresh balls.  If you had an ounce of integrity, you would have done that with stinky balls.  That's a testimonial.  Fresh.  Ew.  That's a real test for the ages.  Oh, fucking shit.  Smells good, right?  Oh, I smell really good.  Will you smell mine?  No.  Please.  No, not a recommend.  No reciprocate.  Will you smell mine?  What a one-way motherfucker.  Sam?  No.  Iraq?  Get Iraq?  Somebody should.  Iraq smells balls?  I swear to God, I'm not saying that. 
[02:09:30]  No, but his balls are different.  Those are Egyptian balls.  Yeah.  Yeah, those balls fucking...  Here comes Iraq.  Here comes Iraq.  Here comes Iraq.  Don't touch them.  Oh, it's Roland.  Roland, Roland, Roland, Roland.  Hi, Roland.  They smell...  I mean, my hand.  I gotta kiss.  Yeah, no.  Fucking fresh.  Fresh balls.  Iraq's coming in.  He's gonna smell Joe's balls.  He's gonna smell Joe's balls.  Dude, you didn't flinch at all when I made those kissing noises.  No, he's yours.  That was you?  I went...  I couldn't hear it, dude.  I'm too fat. 
[02:10:00]  And I couldn't see it.  If I was thinner, I would...  If I was thin, Bob, I would've fucking been mad.  I was actually gonna kiss your balls.  I was afraid you were gonna punch me.  Wow.  Wow.  I wouldn't have punched you.  You kissing my balls?  You kiss a man's balls like that.  Yeah, wow.  You know?  For a gag.  You gotta love college, Joe.  All right.  Iraq.  Iraq, you're gonna smell Joe DeRosa's balls to see how they are.  You wanna do...  Freaking on the mic, Eric.  No videotaping.  No, I'll do it. 
[02:10:30]  Okay, right now...  This is so awful.  You're gonna do fresh balls.  Joe's wearing fresh balls.  That's where my balls is going.  What?  Oh, no.  Oh.  My balls is going.  I'm so happy.  Turn your back to the camera.  I hope it's the same green...  Ah, fuck me.  What'd you say?  I was gonna say Tom Green Cancer joke, but I didn't.  Here it goes.  Iraq.  Iraq.  Is...  Dude.  Gonna kneel down.  It's in there.  It just went back in a little bit.  It's probably humiliating.  I think you got enough nut out there to smell.  I can't get the other one out there.  He's not gonna...  He's not gonna teabag you. 
[02:11:00]  I like the fact that fucking Fruity Iraq turned his hat around.  Because he knows I had to suck it.  Over the top.  Are you getting my...  No, I'm not getting my...  It's definitely balls.  All right, here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Ready?  Smell it.  What does it smell like?  Do one more.  There's...  Nothing, right?  Get close.  Bobby pushed him.  Pussed him into his ball bag.  Did you hit his balls?  I didn't get his ball, but I felt hair just whipped across me.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 
[02:11:30]  How did it smell?  No smell at all.  It smells?  Wow, that's pretty good.  Fresh balls.  It smells like fiber softener.  Would you wear fresh balls?  Yeah, definitely.  How do you apply it?  Well, it's a cream.  It's a cream.  It's a cream, and it turns into a powder.  It comes out of a cock?  It comes out of a...  Yeah?  It's a cream, and you put it in your hands, rub it in your balls, and it turns into like  a powder.  Wow.  Okay?  It's like magic.  It doesn't get mushy like talc.  Right, right.  When you sweat.  It would get gummy.  It doesn't get gummy. 
[02:12:00]  Oh.  That's the best part.  It's like you're wearing talc with no fucking, you know, bread batter.  That's magical.  Fresh balls.  All right.  I'll get you some.  You want some fresh balls?  On that note, let's take a break, and then we'll all just go in the bathroom and smell  each other's nuts.  Yes, we will.  All right.  I'm actually getting fresh balls.  I want to try it.  Yeah?  I got some for you.  You want some?  At 10 o'clock when tickets go on sale for June 9th.  Oh, Jimmy.  Foxwoods, myself, Artie, Nick, and Dave.  I have a...  Why do we have to sign something else? 
[02:12:30]  Oh, a new bit to play to break.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Can I...  Whoa.  I'm going to be at Magoobies.  Magoobies.  Next week in...  Where is it?  Maryland.  Yes.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  And I'm doing South by Southwest next Tuesday.  Ah.  The festival.  Yes, the big festival.  With Amy Schumer.  Yes.  And Gary Gorman.  Up toward the southeast, starting this coming Tuesday in Nashville, North Carolina, and  on to Atlanta, Georgia, Chattanooga, Tennessee, some other places. 
[02:13:00]  Check out JoeDaronesOfComedy.com for all the venues.  Are you going to be driving with a fucking orangutan in the passenger seat?  It's the Every Which Way But Loose Tour.  Hey, boy.  That would have been...  Yeah.  That would have been...  Yeah.  If I had any idea how to market anything.  Yeah.  Ah, you know.  All right.  This is...  We'll be right back.  Making Plans with Jim and Tom.  Oh, okay.  That sounds fun.  Yeah, here you go.  Well, it's time to bring it down a bit. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  Making Plans with Jim and Tom.  You going to stick around for the Sunday show?  You know what?  Everybody got that on the day.  Sunday is the day of the Lord.  Is that day of rest?  I don't like to work on the Lord today.  If the Lord don't work, I don't work.  So I fly casual.  I fly casual on Sunday.  Mm-hmm.  And I'm going to come home and relax and praise his name.  You best have a good show.  It's going to be a 30-year anniversary down there.  Go on, now. 
[02:14:00]  I do believe we will be going to that show.  It's fun.  Lordy, it's hot today.  Yeah.  Why are you ever going to be gone today, gone?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're barely out of the jungle on this planet. 
[02:14:30]  Barely out of the fucking jungle.  What we are is semi-civilized beasts with baseball caps and automatic weapons.  And this civilization of ours that we're so proud of, this civilization with its so-called  civilized behavior, you ever stop and realize how fragile all this is, how easily it could  all just break right down?  Just break right down.  Wouldn't take much.  Probably happened in less than two years. 
[02:15:00]  Wouldn't take much to throw us right back into barbaric times.  All you'd have to do would be eliminate electricity.  That's all.  But completely eliminate electricity.  So, no electricity, no lights.  You're back to candles and lanterns, campfires and bonfires.  Batteries couldn't be recharged.  Generators couldn't be refueled because fuel is pumped electrically.  So is water, by the way.  So no lights, no fuel, no water, no computers.  And computers run everything.  And among the many things computers run and that operate on electricity are security systems. 
[02:15:30]  It's in all of our jails and prisons and nut houses.  So suddenly, without electricity, all across America, the gates and cell doors of penitentiaries  and mental institutions would fly open.  And out would come all of our old friends.  The ones who've been away at camp.  Serial killers, mass murderers, felony rapists, armed robbers, carjackers, home invaders, thieves, 
[02:16:00]  burglars, kidnappers, sadists, pedophiles, sexual predators, pimps, pushers, pornographers, speed freaks, crackheads, sick junkies,  all the ethnic street gangs, black, Spanish and Asian gangs, Japanese jacuzzi, Russian mafia, neo-Nazis, white supremacists,  Sicilian hitmen, Italian mobsters, Jamaican and Colombian drug gangs.  And those are just the ones we caught.  Let's not forget their counterparts still on the outside right now, waiting to hook up with their prison buddies 
[02:16:30]  so they can start a new organization, the American Federation of Sociopaths.  Just what the country needs.  Another special interest group.  Eight to ten million of them there'd be, counting all the parolees and all the probationers  and the ones who've never been caught.  Eight to ten million bitter, angry, violent, sexually hyperactive alpha males  with nothing to do, no hobbies, no medications, no scruples, just a bunch of bad guys looking for a good time. 
[02:17:00]  Maybe dropping by your house.  I hope we're not intruding.  Got any beer?  Oh, good.  Well, I got about 1,400 really thirsty guys here.  How about women?  Got any women?  Oh, just your wife, huh?  Well, I think we can make that work. 
[02:17:30]  Now, boys, there's a lady here, so I want you to mind your manners and wait your turn.  Police wouldn't help you.  They'd be gone at the first sign of trouble.  They'd be home protecting their own families.  So would the Army and the National Guard.  You'd be alone.  You'd be on your own.  You'd be SOL and JWF.  Shit out of luck and jolly well fucked.  Shit out of luck and jolly well fucked.  After a couple of years of living like that, beheadings would be the least of your problems.  People would be lining up to be beheaded. 
[02:18:00]  So let's get back to suicide, which now seems like a reasonable alternative.  What are we listening to here?  This is Eminem.  Oh, okay.  I'm in my Siri.  I changed it.  So she calls me. 
[02:18:30]  You are my master motherfucker.  Really?  Hey, just change your name and your fucking contact.  And your contact.  Did you hear that?  What, did he just blast one?  I hate the Siri commercial where the kid's like, show me a B-flat minor.  Because I was saying the same thing.  Yeah, I'd say that.  Oh, I was a flat minor.  Because you know how funny that is and how fucking lightning fast that is on fucking so  many levels. 
[02:19:00]  The fact that this quick cocksucking comedy genius, and I'll never say that again, actually  did that character with B-flat minor.  Fucking hilarious.  I was going to say that.  No, you weren't, Chip.  Oh, fuck you, Chip, you ruiner.  No.  But that doesn't work.  My wife did Chip last night.  We were watching fucking TV at two in the morning.  I wanted to punch her in her fucking cheekbone and crack it.  Yeah, Siri doesn't work that well like that.  It doesn't have any noise at all. 
[02:19:30]  It sends you to a fucking website.  I could search Google, motherfucker.  I want it popping up on the screen.  I changed it with the jailbreak.  Now it opens up apps for me.  So I go open up Notes, and she opens it up.  If I'm driving, I don't have both thumbs.  Well, if you're driving.  What the fuck are you doing, you lazy?  If you're driving.  If you're driving, you don't want to look at your phone and flip through the shit.  Don't you have to look at it to press the initial button to start it?  No, not at all.  Go ahead.  Just talk to your phone and make it turn on.  Siri, open YouTube.  I think you've got to press a button. 
[02:20:00]  And then don't you have it locked?  YouTube.  Is your phone locked?  Yeah, but huh?  So now you've got to slide it into the car?  No, I go like this.  Open YouTube.  I'm afraid it doesn't work.  It doesn't work.  I don't want it to work.  Fuck.  Look it, look.  Why didn't it talk to you?  Why didn't it say, opening YouTube, douchebag?  She opens up the apps for me now.  It opens the apps.  She does.  She.  I can change my voice on Siri, too.  I can change that.  I can have an English dude.  Hello, Robert.

They go crazy when you do that.  Who's they?  That's uncomfortable because your fucking thing is... 
[02:23:00]  Your squawk is hitting their fucking cunt.  That's when you bring it home.  I do this.  You get on the clip like this and just go...  No, Jimmy does have a...  I've seen Jimmy at work, and he does...  He has a fucking technique that really is...  I don't know if I have it in me, like I can breathe that long.  I don't know if it's because he's a fucking cold-blooded fucking lizard.  I'm reptilian.  It is very reptilian.  He can hold his breath like an alligator, but he does a technique that I've tried to 
[02:23:30]  recreate, and I can't...  I can't get...  Because what happens, I'll do the thing, and then my brain will realize that I'm doing  it for a long time, and then it will just go schizo.  I don't believe you.  That walnut...  This is just terrible.  A walnut!  That fucking stegosaurus brain realizes nothing.  That's just fucking...  You gotta breathe while you're listening.  First of all, wait a minute.  Way back up, you fucking mean people.  I like you. 
[02:24:00]  That's a very angry room.  You call me a walnut...  That's just mean.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  I like this Walter Coppedge guy.  Ah, look at them.  Sitting there on a bite of brook.  She's so hungry.  It's the child fund to send money to starving children.  Yeah, you give them some...  Here's a...  Didn't that used to be called the Children's Christian Fund or something?  Yeah.  And they kind of wanted to take the religious thing out of it, I guess?  Walter Coppedge.  And they changed the babies.  They changed the babies from the African babies to these little Filipino broads.  The shooter ones, because the African ones get too crazy when you pick them up. 
[02:24:30]  They don't have...  I was going to say something terrible, but I backed off of that.  They kick and scream and make all kinds of noises.  They're trying to kiss their tummies.  They show the kids now that look like those women in South America that wear the bolo hats,  and they all look exactly the same.  What are bolo hats?  Those round derby looking hats.  Oh, you're talking about the Guatemalans.  Is that Guatemalans?  Yeah, they wear those hats.  Yeah.  Those with the hats. 
[02:25:00]  They wear those derby hats.  Some of them wear top hats.  Those fucking pieces of shit.  Other guys will just fucking lambast an entire peoples like that for no reason.  And they're wearing bolo derby hats like Edwin G. Robinson.  What pieces of fucking shit?  Really, Dice?  I gave Dice a bit one time.  It was in the limo.  And I'm not going to say the ethnicity, but it might not be the obvious one that somebody 
[02:25:30]  might be thinking.  Yeah.  But it was...  I actually don't remember the ethnicity, but I was complaining about some group.  And I get in the limo with Dice.  Are you?  But I forget what I was saying, but I said something about those little flat-faced fucking monkeys.  And I don't remember what set me off.  This was just us joking in the car, and he's howling.  And he fucking goes on stage that night.  And it became...  I couldn't believe you had the balls to do it.  Hang on.  Honestly, I'm not even being evasive. 
[02:26:00]  I just don't remember what set me off on it, or even what the group was.  And this fucking cunt.  Wow, really?  Dice.  Talk about fucking...  I care about you so much.  Fuck yourself in your ass.  Talk about fucking the people in bolo hats, please.  Oh, those fucking animals with their face.  They all got that face.  Don't they carry a lot of shit on their head up a mountain?  Yeah, on their head.  I like that Rex Ahanti coffee guy with the donkey. 
[02:26:30]  They bring their coffee beans down the mountains, these stupid fucks, with their derby hats.  Fuck off with your derby hat.  I'm looking down.  This one is sucking my cock.  I can't even see, because I'm looking at the top of a stupid fucking hat.  Really does.  She's blowing it with the hat on? 
[02:27:00]  Is that really happening?  I don't know how you're retorting like this is real material.  Oh, yeah, yeah, I know.  What am I doing?  That's right.  That is me.  It's not Dice.  Yeah.  I thought I was listening to Dice for a second.  Dice, don't the little kids sell chicklets?  They try to sell chicklets.  Oh, chicklets, sir.  Chicklets.  Get the fuck out of here with your gum.  I'll give you gum.  Goosh, goosh.  Dice, what do you think about how Bill Maher said Sarah Palin's a cunt? 
[02:27:30]  She is a cunt, but he's a faggot.  Fuck them all, you cocksuckers.  Even the impression couldn't get Anthony to enjoy Bill Maher.  No.  Real Anthony creeps out.  Yeah.  You don't like Bill Maher?  Hey, big fucking forehead.  I like that you fucking drive a truck into that forehead.  You faggot.  Holy shit. 
[02:28:00]  Fucking Chip just laughed.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  What is Valley Girl Gym?  State Dice.  Oh, my God.  Dice, what are you, the casino or something on the table?  What?  What happened?  Chip, what?  I fucking hate Chip.  Hey, Chip's funny.  Yeah.  Me and Dice go out of the road or something like that.  Hey, what are you doing?  We're all around like a bunch of Yahtzee Dice or something.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Dice.  And I'm going to use that one, Chip.  That's hilarious. 
[02:28:30]  Hey, look at it.  We should be in Vegas Dice and Chip or something like we're on a table.  I'm a big stack of chips and you're rolling around like all crazy with steak eyes.  I hope Jim gets amnesia.  I hope he gets in the car and he wakes up.  I think that every time you talk, I wish I had it.  Mean Jimmy.  Oh, shit.  Mean Jimmy.  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Jimmy really woke up.  He really did.  Oh, shit.  He was mumbling his words earlier. 
[02:29:00]  He's dangerous.  Amnesia.  How much is the jailbreaking phone?  You think I'm a sucker?  I don't know.  You think I'm going to fall into your fucking traps?  I mean...  You think I'm falling into your...  Exactly.  You think I don't know you?  You see that?  Look at the shit-eating smirk on his face.  The phone costs $400.  I don't know if I say I like money.  Who's that?  Bidding.  Who is that?  That's his new character.  Who?  Scream out any time someone says the price of something guy.  So if you go like...  Yeah, it costs like $2,500. 
[02:29:30]  I was like, I can't get my spell.  I can't get my spell.  He gets very agitated.  The new iPad is like $600.  $600.  That's it?  $600.  iPad.  What is your eyes?  You can't see or something?  Who's Valley Girl Jim?  I don't know Valley Girl Jim.  He's just this grody guy that comes around here every now and then.  Grody?  Yeah.  He's just grody.  Well, he's not grody.  He doesn't like grody people.  Valley Jim.  I hate Valley Jim.  You hate Valley Girl anything.  I'd rather take Chip the entire show than Valley Jim. 
[02:30:00]  Valley Jim's more rad than grody.  Rad?  He's just like this rad guy.  I think he's from the West Coast.  I fucking hate him.  Can we...  He says gag me with a spoon.  No, he doesn't.  I say gag me with a spoon.  Oh, God.  Oh, the face.  Isn't that embarrassing?  The fucking...  It's like, I'm embarrassed.  The cocksucker makes the face.  His face...  Ugh.  Well, how am I supposed to talk?  Like, with my butt or something?  I know. 
[02:30:30]  Right up.  Bobby's leaving.  Bobby's leaving.  Valley Jim stinks.  Oh, my God.  Bobby's had it.  I fucking hate it.  Isn't that terrible?  I hate...  You know what I hate?  Is his face acting.  Yeah, he's like, oh.  He actually does...  Oh, yeah?  Well, why don't you talk to the mirror or something?  You're really...  You're so grody.  Oh.  Holy shit.  Talk to the mirror.  I hate him. 
[02:31:00]  It really is just embarrassing.  I'll take Chip over that fucking...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  ...fucking piece of shit from the 80s.  It's gold.  Any day.  Yeah?  Like, totally, you'll take something.  Oh, his fucking nose crinkles up.  Yeah, he does the whole Valley Girl thing.  Oh, my God.  Moon Unit Zappa Valley Girl.  I love Frank Zappa.  I hate that song.  That was so bad.  What if it happened to the kids?  They were famous for a minute. 
[02:31:30]  Well, they drank their milk and fell asleep.  Hopefully, fucking Coney woke him up one morning.  The last thing you want to see is Joseph Coney tapping you.  The Joseph Coney alarm.  It's time to wake up, cuckooches.  The last thing Joseph Coney wants to see is Ahmed Zappa.  Oh, shit.  All right.  All right.  Sorry.  What do you want to do?  Joseph Coney is full of spleen of me.  That was the first.  No, you know.  What did you say? 
[02:32:00]  I fucking hate him.  I missed it.  Oh, I don't know if you're going to repeat it.  Valley Gym.  Joseph Coney is full of baloney.  I fucking hate him.  I can't stand him.  Oh, he's so terrible.  I hate him.  You get embarrassed?  Yeah, it's very embarrassing.  Yeah, it gives you two shivers.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's one of those things that are like...  It's more obnoxious than Chip.  That's worse.  Chip is bad, though.  Chip's an asshole.  Chip's addictive.  Yeah.  Chip's addictive. 
[02:32:30]  Well, other people start doing Chip.  Yeah, other people get addicted to doing it.  Yeah, people love doing the Chip thing, even when it's completely inappropriate and doesn't...  It's not a Chip.  I like when people go, would a Chip say that?  It's like, no.  I know.  Just shut up when you stop with your fucking T-S-S-S.  Shut up.  I like the fact that your ring fits like a corset.  Oh, man.  It looks like salami string.  Oh, fuck. 
[02:33:00]  Really?  Joe's really a punch...  Joe Reynolds had to punch up a joke.  He stood up for that one.  That was a good one.  He's standing.  I'm sick of him standing and sitting.  I get antsy.  Shut up.  You're not getting antsy.  You're not fucking in your 60s.  You're not nervous legs.  You're not getting them in your pouncey.  Oh, thank God.  It is horrible.  And the hand acting that goes along with the face acting for that character is really what's really...  It's the only time you'll see hand acting.  Yeah. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, no.  He puts his hand up.  Oh.  But his nose.  Yeah.  Fucking...  I don't like the sides of his nose.  Crinkles.  Yeah.  Well, I don't like the smell in here.  Okay.  Stop it.  Stop.  It's an embarrassing old impression that people used to do.  Like, there are certain impressions that you just can't do anymore because they're so hacky and old and dumb.  Overdone.  Yeah, yeah.  They were done fucking decades ago.  It'd be like if a guy on this show still did a Ronald Reagan impression. 
[02:34:00]  Yes.  Oh, shit.  Talk to the hand.  Yes.  Well...  Jesus.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Yeah.  You're a grody.  Yeah.  Bag me with a spoon, my man.  Oh, my God.  You're so old.  You should call dirt by name or something.  Oh, look at...  Let's do some improv.  Do Arnold Schwarzenegger, but as a governor, not an actor. 
[02:34:30]  No, I don't do real Arnold.  I can do him.  I can do him.  Go ahead.  I do fake Arnold.  I'll be back or something.  Chip's the worst.  Has Chip ever gotten a good one and elbowed you?  Let me tell you something.  I hate...  Oh, no.  I hate the physical contact, and then I hate the...  The...  Yeah.  Honey, tell you.  Well, I hate your hat with you, hurry or something.  Get off the nudge.  I hate the nudge.  It's uncomfortable, his forearm nudge that he gives you.  It's supposed to be like an elbow to the ribs, like, right? 
[02:35:00]  Ha-ha.  But he goes like...  And he molests you with his forearm.  It's disgusting.  It's uncomfortable.  It feels like a raw chicken wing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking terrible.  Chip's the worst.  Valley Girl, whoever the fuck that is, is an asshole.  Valley...  Dice, what do you think of Valley Girl, Dice?  Hey, yikes, fucker!  It's always just about the fucking...  Can you talk about the pan-faced assholes?  What was the thing you said?  Flat-faced fucking monkeys. 
[02:35:30]  No, these fucking...  Where are they?  Guadamonkeys?  They fucking with the hat?  And they're always carrying tobacco or coffee on their heads?  What is that?  Get a truck, you fucking savage.  You're letting the drive.  What's this, a balancing act?  On your head?  What?  You dumb motherfuckers.  What?  Holy shit, dude. 
[02:36:00]  That never gets old.  I love when he does that.  Whatever.  I hate him.  I hate him.  I hate him.  There was a news story yesterday.  I heard...  Who cares?  No, Mall in Jersey.  I'm kidding.  Mall in Jersey.  Some guy was shoplifting and took a chick hostage with a knife.  Oh, as if.  Oh, God.  I'm in a person.  Oh, God, no. 
[02:36:30]  It's just annoying.  Oh, I hate Valley Jim.  Yeah, it was...  A guy was shoplifting.  Security kind of catches on the shoplifting.  A guy?  Yeah.  A guy.  Well...  Say it.  Yeah, well, I'm...  A guy, yeah.  A gentleman.  All right.  A gentleman.  A gentleman.  Yeah, right.  And so he starts running away from security, realizes he's going to get caught, grabs a  woman, random woman, and just holds the knife to her throat.  Right.  So these cops, uniformed cops that work in the parking lot or some shit, come inside,  tell them, drop the knife, drop the knife. 
[02:37:00]  He doesn't drop it.  They fucking take the head shot.  One of the cops takes the fucking head shot while he's holding the woman with the knife  to the throat, blasts him right in the fucking head.  He's dead.  Hostage is fine.  That's movie shit.  If he died immediately, but then as he fell, he just slowly sliced her throat.  He just plunges into her and then goes down and cuts her like fucking Antonio Andolini.  Ah!  Can you imagine you're going to the mall, though, her story? 
[02:37:30]  How is the mall?  Well, I was in line, and the next thing you know, a man's holding a knife to my throat,  and then he gets murdered.  I was trying to get those new colored tampons at Target.  They have new color-y ones?  Yeah, they're fashionable.  Ew, for what?  They're going to be red and awful when you pull them out.  You really hate periods.  Jimmy hates periods.  I found, I almost took a picture of it on Instagram.  What?  It was a fucking tampon fell out of the garbage.  Where? 
[02:38:00]  On the street.  Oh.  And it was fucking blood.  You shouldn't call her that.  Hey, garbage!  Hey, your tampon fell out of garbage!  I told her, hey, garbage!  Bleed to death, then!  Eat!  Oh, you did that.  Eat my shorts.  Oh, fuck.  Billy Jim's going to have an owl.  It was on the ground.  Fuck, and I looked over my...  I didn't see it, but I saw my girl dog going over it or something, and I looked. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, man.  I almost threw up, because you could see the dark red period blood.  It was full.  It was full.  Deep, dark, rich...  That's like espresso blood.  Yeah.  That comes out of a pussy.  It is.  Yeah, really?  It is the fucking dark chocolate of blood.  That's the blood that would kill a vampire.  That rotting, stagnant, vampire-killing blood that comes out of that thing.  Barf me out.  Oh, barf me out. 
[02:39:00]  I'm sorry, guys.  He really is the worst character.  I'm sorry.  I'm fucking...  It's my fault.  I apologize.  I know.  The second you said it, I'm like, oh, no.  It's my fault.  Some douchebag on Twitter told me to fucking ask him.  Some asshole on Twitter was like, ask him about this.  And I was like, okay.  Great.  Yeah, I remember the old days when girls used Kotex pads, you know, those big pads.  And I guess, you know, mom was still getting her period and had to wrap it up in the toilet 
[02:39:30]  paper and put it in the bathroom garbage.  And then occasionally the fucking dog would get at it.  Nice.  And it just looked like a jackal on the plains of the Serengeti.  Just ripping a zebra neck out.  It was terrible.  That wrapped up pad in the trash.  It looked like a fucking prom abortion.  You know, they fucking just emptied out into the fucking can.  You know, that dog was like this.  Bacon.  Bacon.  Bacon.  Bacon.  Why can't I get more bacon?  Kotex. 
[02:40:00]  He ran up to that garbage bin.  Oh, my God.  She left a steak in the barrel.  To them, that is like a fucking steak.  Fuck, yeah.  Because it's thick, dark blood.  And there's always a hunk of something on the outside.  And that's like a clot.  Oh, my God.  What the fuck's wrong with...  What are you talking about?  That's what the fucking tamps look like when they're that thick.  How do you know?  They're clotted.  Oh.  I've sucked them.  No, you haven't.  No, but there are guys that do.  So what do you mean?  What is that called?  It's a period fetish.  It's disgusting.  It's disgusting and sick.  It's disgusting.  I've had sex.  I've had sex. 
[02:40:30]  I don't mind having sex when they're on their periods.  It's not as good as when they're not.  It feels weird.  You roll over.  You feel like Jack Walsh.  Like who?  I'm the godfather.  Who's Jack Walsh?  The guy with the horse in his bed.  I start pulling the sheets away.  When you fuck with the period, it gets dry.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Once the blood hits the air, it just turns into fucking shock.  It's a horrible murder scene. 
[02:41:00]  It's gross.  And then you get it like you could get it.  Sometimes if it's light, it's just a little ring around your dick.  Yeah.  But sometimes, I swear, it can go from like almost your kneecaps to your chest.  It looks like you were blasted with a shotgun in the groin.  It's like he's being Zed from fucking Pulp Fiction.  Girls get mad, too.  I've had girls get mad at me.  Come on.  It's just a little blood.  It's like, all right, let me fucking slice my dick open and you suck on it.  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:41:30]  Fuck you.  Yeah, you whore.  Exactly.  Thanks a lot, AIDS scare.  Get out of here.  Did you ever see that movie, Your Friends and Neighbors, with Jason Patrick and Ben Stiller?  No.  Brutal fucking movie.  It's brutal, man.  It's about three couples that just, they're miserable people.  It's fucking brutal.  But there's this, Jason Patrick plays this fucking, like, scumbag womanizer.  There's a scene where he corners Kathleen Keener in a library and he goes,  you're a useless fucking cunt. 
[02:42:00]  Like, it's just a brutal movie.  But there's a scene where he's yelling at a chick through his bathroom door and she's  in the bathroom crying and you're like, he's free.  You're like, why is he dressing her down like this?  And you find out it's because she got her period.  And he fucked up his sheets.  And he's literally going, you stupid fucking whore.  Like, you didn't fucking know you were going to get it, you piece of shit.  Wow.  Yeah.  Dude, it's one of the most brutal movie scenes I've ever seen.  It's this guy, Neil.  It's the guy that did In the Company of Men. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, he was great.  That's a great movie.  Neil Abute.  Dude, every movie is like guys somehow just dismembering, not literally dismembering,  but just like dismantling women.  Imagine a girl like that.  It's brutal, dude.  She bled on the sheets and you just dressed her down like that.  It makes you uncomfortable for the women.  Yeah.  Really uncomfortable.  You feel a lot of empathy for the women, though, even though these must be the most fun  roles to play.  I'm going to say, what?  You're a fucking cunt.  You had your period.  I could sing that in my sleep.  Sing it. 
[02:43:00]  You cunt.  You had your period.  Did you break it in my office and steal my script?  Wait a minute.  Jimmy's song is the best.  I want that as my ringtone.  Can you sing it more?  You cunt, you got your period.  Period.  I love that he chose classical.  He could have chose hip hop.  I could have done a little queen.  You are a cunt and you got your period.  Oh. 
[02:43:30]  Is that queen?  That's good.  What about some rock and roll?  Some heavy.  You're a cunt and you got your period.  That's all I got.  I hate shit.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  That's.  But I'll tell you.  These guys are great.  For some reason, blood does come out of the sheets.  It does.  It comes out of the sheets.  It never stains.  No.  No.  No.  Of course you'd know that.  You fucking goddamn creepy old dude. 
[02:44:00]  I'd just be period blood then.  Yeah.  Not bad.  You know.  Not murder blood.  You got to throw those away.  It's the same rule.  I won't fucking do it.  And I don't.  I don't like redheads because you can see the blood pumping into their vaginas.  Oh.  That kind of translucent.  That inner thigh.  The visible woman model.  Where do you fuck them?  On an operating table?  Who looks at the thighs and the blood?  Just fucking turn the lights off and do what I do.  Put your face down and I can just groan.  What a treat. 
[02:44:30]  And smell their ears.  Thanks for the advice, Jim.  What are you doing?  What my friend Jim told me to do.  Yeah.  Because the side of the blood rushing into your pussy makes me physically ill.  Jesus Christ.  Fucking ginger doll.  Oh, shit.  So their pussy lips get real red?  The redheads?  Redheads, yeah.  Their pussy lips get recon...  Yeah, because there's no...  Never had a henna head?  I have, but I didn't notice.  Yeah, there's no...  They bruise easy.  You grab their leg a little bit and all of a sudden there's a black mark. 
[02:45:00]  What are you doing?  Your fingerprint is actually in her thigh.  What are you, a goon-legging them?  Yeah, I don't fuck with redheads.  Rebanon?  I like a good freckled redhead.  Yeah, it's good because it's different, you know.  Yeah.  I like those risen moles, too.  They're bumpy.  Just a bump.  Your hand goes over it and it fucking...  Ugh.  And the hair on their arms is rougher than regular, let's say, humans.  But red hair tends to be coarser.  Unless you get a strawberry blonde girl.  Because it's like...  And then it's like... 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, it's like survival hair.  You know what?  Seriously.  It's very wiry.  Because their fucking skin is more...  Oh, it's fair, so it's got to, like, shade them from the sun.  Yeah, it's like...  Their hair is like a fucking...  Like a canopy in a rainforest.  He just made that up, but it sounds great.  I just made it up.  I don't know.  Just Wikipedia that.  I don't know.  Redheads have coarser hair to protect them from the elements.  By the way, in a couple years, we won't be able to make fun of redheads anymore.  Or we'll go back and go, do you remember we used to just trash redheads?  Why?  Who can't we make fun of them now?  Why they're going to be...  No, but I'm saying, like, every special interest group. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, right.  They'll be like the redheads against fucking bullying.  Yeah.  Some thin-lip cunt.  With one...  With a messed up fang tooth.  Yeah.  Just a dead tooth.  All redheads have one dead tooth.  What do you mean?  Like a crooked one, or...?  Yeah, they got some cat out there.  Oh, what's the matter?  Are you getting personal?  No, not at all.  I'm just saying.  I like...  Certain redheads make me...  I like the dark redheads that can tan.  The ones that can tan are fine.  The ones that can't go in the sun, because they're... 
[02:46:30]  Real pale.  Oh, their fingernails will fall off.  Fuck them.  Their fingernails?  What does that mean?  I hate them.  I hate them.  The sun gets under there, and they just pop off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or slide off.  They slide off.  The fly.  Oh, yeah.  That's what I was going to say.  Great.  What's happening to me?  Am I dying?  Probably one of the worst parts of that movie is when the fingernails, he's just like chewing  it.  That is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen in my life.  What is that?  The Fly with Jeff Goldblum.  Yeah, that was a good one. 
[02:47:00]  Holy Christ.  That didn't scare me at all.  Why was it scary?  It was gross.  It's so disturbing to watch.  David Cronenberg said when he remade it, he goes...  He said AIDS was so popular in the media at the time that he goes, I just thought  it'd be really terrifying if I made it like this degenerative thing where he fell  apart.  Yeah, yeah.  And that's what's so disturbing about it.  He's like literally slowly becoming deformed and falling apart.  It's so scary.  And the worst part of it was like he knew it and kind of felt all like there was nothing  he could do about it.  It wasn't like, ah, I'm a monster.  Look out.  But he was still like just, oh, fuck, man. 
[02:47:30]  I'm falling apart.  Remember the old movie?  All of a sudden, the guy goes in in a suit and he comes out wearing a fly hat.  Like, oh, wow.  He's got big wings.  He's zipping around, landing on shit.  He really was the worst fly because he was just a human body and the fly head and arm.  Yeah.  And he'd still wear like a fedora on it.  I'm going to work, honey.  What?  Right?  It's a stupid fucking fly hat.  He really was big, dumb eyes.  Hey, can you see that?  No, it's in the next town.  Fucking good eyes.  And that's one of those movies, too, where everybody goes, one of the scariest scenes 
[02:48:00]  in film history when she takes the hood off and you see 20 of her because it's fly.  It's like it's not scary.  It looks like it's Spencer's Gifts, man.  It's not scary.  Even if it was the 50s, it wouldn't scare you.  In the 50s, though, that would have scared people.  Not even if I was a fucking fly hunter.  It would have scared people in the 50s.  Negroes.  Exactly.  Patch of Blue scared people in the 50s.  Fucking guess who's coming to dinner in the 60s.  To serve with love.  He came out of the telepod with a tan. 
[02:48:30]  She starts screaming.  She takes the fucking thing off his head.  He's black.  Yeah.  Yes.  The movie theater's fucking screaming.  People are running out fainting.  Brock Peters.  Calm down now.  Everybody, calm down.  Calm down.  It's me, baby.  It's me.  It's me, baby.  Oh, shit.  What you getting all riled up for?  Yeah.  It's not like I'm a fly.  I'm the same motherfucker you've been with.  Yeah.  And look at this.  Oh, my God. 
[02:49:00]  Whoa.  Holy shit.  Gold blew me up.  It was because it was.  I love that we just.  I love that we just fucking ran out of steam.  No, we didn't.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are you, a bunch of steam engines or something?  Fucking the worst.  Really?  And then when he starts going crazy from it and he's going, there wasn't all I need to swallow  a fly.  Perhaps we'll die.  He starts doing all that shit.  It's so crazy.  It's like, Jesus.  Is Sam growing horns?  What do you mean?  Oh, he's always had those side little demon things from his hair.  What is that?  Are you getting thin, dude?  Are you losing weight? 
[02:49:30]  Uh-oh.  It's.  Oh, my God.  Bag your face.  Oh, God.  Sam looks like one of the Fright Night vampires.  It doesn't look like a vampire.  It looks like the ghoul, the vampire helper.  Do you mean his head ridges?  Yeah, that's the fucking.  Those fucking Hellboy things?  Yeah.  What is that?  Are you all right?  Yeah, the big twisted ones.  Yeah, I'm fine.  I've lost some weight since I was younger, but.  Yeah.  What the fuck is going on with those head ridges?  Yeah, what are those?  Meandrus.  How do you lose weight?  You're like a skinny guy.  I had some baby fat and it started, my metabolism started slowing down. 
[02:50:00]  Would you lose weight in your head?  I just, you know, body fat.  You lose it.  Have you ever got that checked out?  That might, you might be like another species.  It's the shape of my skull.  Like if they find your skull like a hundred years from now, what the fuck is this?  Yeah, why is he at least two fucking weird like guardrails?  Yeah, you fucking stupid Nefertiti head.  His skull would be perfect for the predator to like run his fingernail over as he's holding it.  Yeah, on the brow.  Yeah, definitely. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, when he gets mad, some wings shoot out of that forehead.  Yeah.  Oh yeah, the predator would hold the skull.  Yeah, he'd hold the skull and kind of run his fingernail over it like all proud of his kill.  Fucking predator rules.  I like when he pulled that spine out.  It was fucking, that was great.  First predator.  That movie was just a great fucking movie.  That scene where, it might be my favorite scene and it's not even anything crazy, but  just when he's got to fix himself, the predator's to fix himself.  Yeah.  And he does, and he lets out that fucking scream. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  And you see Schwarzenegger's crew, they have that reaction like when they realize like  what the fuck are we up against out here?  Like what just made that noise?  Well, when he did that, that was just Schwarzenegger was the only one alive.  What?  When he cut his leg?  No, no.  No, no.  The others were alive.  It's because it's when they all unloaded.  Yeah.  I don't know why I had to fucking correct you, but I just.  And that was a great scene when they're all just shooting into the fucking brush.  It's just an amazing display of firepower that they're all just shooting.  Did anybody hit him or no? 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, that's where he got hit and they left some of that glowy green snot blood.  But talk about a badass movie because that was still when Carl Weathers was like still  like an action star.  Oh yeah, badass, yeah.  And Jesse Ventura was still like wrestling related.  So it's like when those two guys were part of the crew and they just got fucking iced.  Like not that far in.  Jesse's chest gets blown up and then Carl Weathers is like this thing's not fucking around in this movie.  I love how they do that in the movies.  They did that to Seagal in that president.  What was that movie with? 
[02:52:00]  Where he was the cook?  No, no, no.  He was in the first like five, ten minutes of the movie.  And then he gets sucked out of a stealth bomber.  Remember they were going on the plane with John Leguizamo and Kurt Russell?  They were under siege.  Kurt Russell.  Kurt Russell.  It's not under siege.  Yeah, I know what you mean.  Yeah, it's under siege.  Executive decision.  The president's hat box.  Executive decision.  Executive decision.  Seagal was at the top of his game and he was out of that movie in the first ten minutes.  Wasn't he going from plane to plane?  Yes.  Oh yeah, that was cool.  And you were like, what the fuck? 
[02:52:30]  Seagal's dead fuck.  The whole movie, you're expecting him to come back.  I had a parachute.  You know what I mean?  Somebody didn't.  Yeah.  Well, that's what was so ridiculous about the predators, the new one they made.  You're like, fucking Schwarzenegger led a pack of the baddest dudes on earth in the jungle  to fight this thing.  One of them.  One.  And Schwarzenegger barely made it out alive.  Yep.  Now you guys are up against five of them.  I'm supposed to believe Adrian fucking Brody is the guy that got you out of this right 
[02:53:00]  now.  I haven't seen that.  Yeah.  It sucked.  It's not a predator movie.  What was it, Predator vs. Jason?  Was that one?  No, they had Alien vs. Predator, which I don't consider a Predator or Alien movie either.  Alien vs. Predator.  Don't like it.  Did you see Adrian Brody?  I think it was Splice.  The horror movie just came out a couple of years.  Like last year, Adrian Brody's in it.  And they create like this alien baby or this demon baby or some shit.  Oh yeah.  And he winds up fucking it.  Really?  Him and his girl create this, they're scientists, they create this new life form and it's just 
[02:53:30]  crazy.  I didn't see the, I forget the fucking beginning of it.  She has like these fucking deer legs.  She has wings and a regular.  And he fucks it?  Well, yeah.  She's kind of hot.  She's kind of hot with deer legs?  Yeah.  She's kind of hot.  They have a sundress on her and she kind of clicks around like hooves.  And then his girl goes out one day and the chick, the alien thing kind of catches him  in a, you know, in a weakened state and he fucking bangs the shit out of him.  Guys would do that though.  Yeah. 
[02:54:00]  Five fucking aliens in a second.  It's like, I'll fuck it.  Deer legs.  Deer legs.  Fucking hold those legs right up over her head.  And then his chick comes home and she's like, what the fuck?  Wow.  He's fucking this broad in a barn.  And then, yeah.  Did it get pregnant?  It, uh, no, it died.  From being fucked?  No, his jizz killed it.  His human jizz killed it.  I wish the girls I fucked would do that when I'm done.  Just die, you fucking cunt. 
[02:54:30]  You can say anything in that voice.  Oh, dice.  Oh, look who's here.  Uh, we should, you want to take a break or you want to invite him in?  Uh, what time is it?  It's, uh, 23 after the hour.  Do we need another break or no?  I don't think we do.  I don't care.  Do you have any reads over there?  I don't know.  Reads?  Schmeads, I say.  Leave him for the shit show.  Can someone bring Bobby in a chair?  Yeah, Bobby needs a chair.  Preferably an electric one.  See?  To kill you.  Or a wheel. 
[02:55:00]  A wheelchair.  You gotta wait.  You can't just laugh.  I know.  Wait, you fucking anxious asshole.  I'm terrible.  You know, I could be funny.  Like the gym.  I could do that.  When you say something, it should happen.  I know this.  When you say something, it should happen.  A lickety split.  And the fact that you're the talent, you have to work this shit out.  Dominic Lombardozzi.  You might remember him from The Wire.  Right?  And he's Breakout Kings, which is a more popular show.  Yeah.  Than The Wire.  In The Wire?  I think, yeah.  It's mainstream popularity. 
[02:55:30]  Absolutely.  Oh, yeah.  It's pretty impressive.  Is it a Bronx tale, too?  A Bronx-ish tale.  No, he was.  Was he?  It says he's a native of the Bronx and started acting in 93 in a Bronx tale.  I'm going to ask him about that.  Hey.  Hey.  Dominic, what's up, man?  Hey, Dora.  Take a seat.  Have fun.  We're on the air.  We just do this.  We're like, ah, screw it.  Come on in.  No, we were going to.  And then we said, screw it.  Why bother?  Mike Six.  Mike Six.  Why bother?  What's up, man?  You're on. 
[02:56:00]  That's Bobby and Joe.  Hi, buddy.  How are you?  Nice to meet you, man.  There's a bunch of comics in here today.  Good to see you, man.  What's happening?  Good to see you.  What's going on?  And Jimmy Norton, of course.  You smell really good.  Dom smells good.  Jesus, man.  You smell great.  What the fuck is wrong with it?  What is it?  Fresh balls like you two are wearing?  Jesus Christ.  Fresh balls is good.  I saw Dom outside the building a week ago, and we said hello, and we hugged, and on the holy  home, I could smell you on my shirt.  I feel like a girl.  What a hot date that was.  Wasn't that in Brokeback Mountain? 
[02:56:30]  He was smelling the other guy's shirt the whole time?  Well, no.  Wasn't it quite like that?  Yeah, I know.  It's good.  This was more of a hello, not a tent rape.  We just said hi to each other.  I was like, this is what me and Norton could look like if we fucking, we had better genes.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, it really is depressing.  But you're in season two now, man.  Yeah.  Breakout Kings, yeah.  This Sunday is the second airing, second episode.  Do you think this is more popular than The Wire mainstream-wise?  Because it seems like this is getting a lot more attention than The Wire did when it was 
[02:57:00]  on.  A lot of people are talking about this show, maybe because it's Twitter.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, it's getting out there.  You know, A&E, which is really now known for their scripted series, more reality.  It's getting out there.  And, but, like what we talked about the last time, The Wire is so big now.  Yeah.  With the DVDs and people, you know, people, word of mouth, it's just become like this cult  classic.  And that must be odd for you guys because, you know, to you, it was a while ago. 
[02:57:30]  It's a job you did quite a while ago.  So, when people first watch it now, to them, it just happened, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  We started in 2001.  I think we finished in 2007.  Are they ever going to do a movie?  Are they going to, didn't I hear talks about maybe doing a Wire the movie?  No, but I think that a lot of those other shows on, on HBO, I think like Entourage might  be doing a movie.  I don't think that's David Simon's kind of thing. 
[02:58:00]  Really?  The Wire animated series?  No.  You were on Entourage too.  I did.  I did three episodes.  Yeah.  I remember I turned it on.  He was just blasting the chick from behind.  He's just fucking, and he opened the door.  What's up, man?  He's just fucking cranking this broad.  Yeah.  Came in like a tornado on that show.  Yeah.  What did you wear when you fucking banged it?  You got to wear something to like keep your...  They make this, it's like this sock.  A cock sock?  Yeah, something like that.  Did you get a rod? 
[02:58:30]  Is that the name?  Yeah.  That's it.  I don't know if I would have got a rod in front of those people, but it would have  been hard not to.  It's the most uncomfortable feeling in the world.  Oh, really?  Yeah, that's got to be, man.  That's got to be.  Do you understand?  If I, it wouldn't fit in the thing that they gave me, I'd actually have to get a semi just  to get it in it, because I have a little mushroom.  You're making it sound like it would be, like it would be too big.  No.  That's what it sounded like.  That's the way it came off.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the way.  No, not at all.  He has to get a cock sock with a rubber band.  They'd be like, put it in this. 
[02:59:00]  I'd have to rub it.  Hang on one second.  I'd never done a fucking fool around scene with a girl.  I made that with Nina Hartley.  Yeah, yeah.  You did a little kissing.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How was that?  It was phenomenal.  Yeah?  Because I was nervous.  I had never kissed.  It was a comedy.  No, this is probably 98, 99.  I love her so much.  She's very sexy.  And I walked up to him, like, look, I never did a kissing scene before.  Are we supposed to use tongue?  Like, I don't want to be disrespectful, because she was a porn chick, and I'm like, I was actually  being extra.  Oh, yeah.  Don't be disrespectful.  Well, that's why, though. 
[02:59:30]  At the comic strip.  Principles.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You don't have a fucking resume.  Asshole.  DP.  She's doing DP, but you don't want to be disrespectful by asking for a kiss.  Drink nine loads out of a martini glass.  Listen, I've never...  Should I jerk off on your cheek after we make out?  What's the proper etiquette here?  I know you've done ass-to-mouth, but listen, let me ask you a question.  I don't want to offend you.  Can I kiss you?  Yeah, in hindsight, that was a very silly stand-up.  Of course you can.  So she's like, yeah. 
[03:00:00]  She's like, yeah, come here, baby.  We're supposed to be attracted to each other.  She just starts making out with me in the green room.  Like, the little dress room area, yeah.  And she's rubbing my dick, and...  Oh, on the rehearsal.  That's exactly what it was.  Let's get this right.  Come on, now.  It's not Julia Roberts, you ass.  I'd rather fool around Nina Harley.  I'm amazed.  She started, like, touching me.  Yeah, she's porn star.  She kissed me right away.  She was doing research.  Yeah, yeah.  She knows.  She's a professional.  She was fucking sexy, man.  I'd rather fool around her than Julia Roberts.  Julia Roberts is hot, but... 
[03:00:30]  I love Nina Harley.  Yeah, she's hot.  Yeah.  Remember that?  Oh, right.  She was the one that was fucking...  She was the one that was fucking...  William H. Macy's...  Yeah, yeah.  Whatever you want to call it.  His wife.  Fucking the guy in the parking lot, and they're all gathered around watching, and William H.  Macy is just like, man.  Leave me alone.  He goes, what kind of lights do you want?  He goes, my wife's got an ass in her cock.  Yeah.  He said it back.  Yeah.  So, William H. Macy is so great in that movie.  He's great in everything.  I love him.  An ass in her cock.  An ass in her cock.  The way he just walks in and blows his fucking head off. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, yeah.  It's like a New Year's Eve party.  Jesus Christ.  He said the guy was asking him about the...  I think it was the first day of shooting the porno the next day, and it was like a kickoff  party.  That was the scene, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he was like, I'm thinking this for tomorrow, and he just came out.  Yeah.  He's watching it get fucked, but the group watches are fucked well.  He was great in that movie.  Fucking...  Did you ever see him in Oleana?  Holy Christ.  I was in it.  I was in Oleana.  Oh, yeah.  You told me that one.  I was a fucking...  The only extra work I ever did, first, when I was in Boston, my acting teacher got me 
[03:01:30]  the gig.  I got in trouble because I ordered a pizza.  Because they went, you know, leave it to you.  They don't fucking feed you.  You got to wait.  Jesus Christ.  He's starving in a fucking hot sun in a field.  I ordered a pizza.  The guy pulled up in the middle of a fucking scene, honking his horn because he couldn't  be...  He was honking his horn on the phone.  He was honking his horn.  He was honking his horn.  He was honking his horn.  God.  And then all of a sudden, this German broad who took care of all the...  Who ordered the pizza?  On our headset. 
[03:02:00]  And I was like, I dig, you fucking twat.  Feed me.  If we're both here, isn't it our time?  And they ran out of...  I was in one of my fats.  I think it was my third fat.  So they didn't have fucking clothes to fit me.  So they dressed me in...  I looked like Fred Flintstone.  They didn't give me a backpack because it was a college.  They gave me a bowling bag.  I'm so...  I'm in...  Nothing fits me.  I'm just a fatty with a bowling bag in the background.  That stupid movie.  Damn it.  I love it.  Can you be seen in the movie?  Yeah.  I never watched it.  It was the most...  I watched a couple minutes of the Mammet back and forth. 
[03:02:30]  I want to fucking...  I love Mammet stuff.  You don't like Mammet stuff?  I do.  I like some of it.  One of my favorites.  That one was fucking annoying.  Oleana's annoying.  It's really persistent.  That one.  Yes.  Yes.  But what I'm saying...  But what I'm saying is...  What I'm saying is that...  What are you saying?  It's...  Jeez.  It is...  But that scene at the end...  What scene?  Have you seen it in Oleana?  Have you seen it?  No, I haven't.  Never mind.  But that's that type thing.  But that's that back and forth shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's very...  You think I should go?  I think I should go.  It's really weird.  Mantanya's great at that shit. 
[03:03:00]  Do you want to go with?  I will go with.  He's a little old Mammet.  Do you see Edmund?  Yeah.  With William H. Macy.  Brutal.  I didn't like the message at the end, but...  Don Amici?  No, that's called Things Change.  Don Amici?  Yeah.  Don Amici?  Who's she?  Don Amici?  No, Don Amici.  The actor, Don Amici.  Don Amici, yeah.  Don Amici, yeah.  He was in a Mammet movie called Things Change.  He was like a failure gangster.  Yeah, yeah.  Fucking hug Joe's in his element right now.  This cocksucker loves trivia movies.  Man, right? 
[03:03:30]  Look at him go.  I got one.  In life, he doesn't have experiences.  He relates it to a scene in a movie.  To movies, yes.  I like the cable guy.  It's like when Joe Montana said...  What?  No, Joe Montana.  Whatever the fuck his name is.  Joe Montana.  I don't give a fuck.  I'm talking about the quarterback when he did that commercial.  Here's a trivia question.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  Who played the Don in Godfather 2?  The Don?  Michael Cordelia. 
[03:04:00]  Really bad trivia questions.  And you're making dumb faces when you do it.  Yeah.  I just...  Why are we talking other movies and shows and actors?  I don't know.  That's right.  Because he knows all these guys.  Or at least he's aware of their work.  On the new show, though, there's the nerdy guy.  What's his name?  Jimmy Simpson.  Jimmy Simpson.  He...  Yeah, he's a fucking talented guy.  He's phenomenal.  He's really...  He's in a show...  He did an episode of Psych.  That's one of my favorite shows.  Yeah, yeah.  He's fucking hilarious.  The producer, Mel Demanski, directed a few of our episodes. 
[03:04:30]  Right.  And they're coming back for another season, aren't they?  Yeah, they just came back.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's weird, too, because I didn't know this, because I never really did TV-TV.  I've done, like, a part here and there, Law and Order, whatever.  But on that show, 2-2, there's a different director, a different crew.  You know, the crew kind of stays the same, but there's a different director, PA.  All these people change out.  And there's, like, six or eight writers. 
[03:05:00]  And there's all these directors.  So every week, you're switching up who the fuck's...  Completely.  Completely switching up who's there.  So some directors, really cool.  They like you.  They get you.  Some guys are very business.  Let's fucking go.  Shut your face.  Gotta be rough for the crew.  Yeah.  Right?  I didn't know that.  I Law and Order.  I'm an asshole.  No, I Law and Order is the same way.  But I didn't know that because I only did one at a time.  But being on that show, the 2-2 every episode, it's like every week, you have a different  director that you have to...  Different director.  And did they switch off the first ADs? 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, it's like...  Odds and evens, kind of...  Yeah.  Because the reason for that is because...  The AD is the assistant director.  Assistant director.  No, I'm kidding.  And...  Google it, people.  They're preparing.  So when one AD is there, the other one is usually preparing or prepping the director  that's going to do the next episode.  Right.  That's why they switch off.  But, you know, I think there's some shows where there might be two or three different 
[03:06:00]  directors and what they do is they alternate.  Why do they do that, though?  Because they have to do their cuts.  Because you have to...  You can't do it every week.  Yeah.  You have to...  There has to be one...  You can't trap and cut it at the same time.  Yeah.  Jake Gyllenhaal's dad was a director on one of the shows.  It was...  He used to do...  I think he was History Blues.  Yeah.  He used to do directors.  History Blues.  Yeah.  A little show.  A while ago.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Fuck.  What's happening in Breakout Kings?  Because I saw the teaser about somebody getting... 
[03:06:30]  They fucking...  What are they doing?  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is all over Twitter.  They dropped a big one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, it's no surprise, I guess.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We could talk about it.  They killed the character, Charlie Duchamp.  Yep.  And now, what they did was, they created a show that's set up as a procedural.  Now, they put some sort of serial aspect to the show.  So, now, we would be chasing the Damien character throughout. 
[03:07:00]  So, there's a running storyline, and then the other peripherals, the storylines that go around with it.  It's pretty much like an extra ingredient that they put into the show.  I like when that happens on a show.  Like, you know, shows like The X-Files used to do that, where they'd have that story about David Duchovny's sister and that whole alien thing.  But then there were weird shit stories that would go on.  What's a procedural?  What's that mean, a procedural?  Well, it's when they take a finger and touch your prostate.  And the procedure's like a law and order. 
[03:07:30]  Like, every episode...  A one-off.  It'll, you know, there'll be a case, and by the end, you know, you're...  Oh, there's no running...  Gum-gum.  There's no ongoing sort of story, like, you know, The Wire, Sopranos.  Those were serialized shows.  Oh, okay.  They're an ongoing story.  Procedurals are wrapped up every episode.  Different storylines.  And that's what they incorporated into Breakout Kings this season.  Oh, okay.  So, it's kind of like a procedural...  That must suck as an actor to...  I mean, you know beforehand, but to get the script, just see dead. 
[03:08:00]  Oh, yeah.  It's like, oh, boy.  How did they tell you this guy was going to die, they just gave you all the script, or  did they sit you down and go, look, we're not renewing his contract?  Well, you know, I heard from Laz.  He called, you know, it was something we knew we were going into the first episode.  And, you know, I had mentioned it on Twitter.  It was the hardest day working on a set.  Why?  Because, you know, you work with somebody. 
[03:08:30]  You create a show.  This show has went through a lot of different obstacles.  And we've always been together.  You know, so you become sort of a team.  You're out, two years out.  Become a little family.  And then you're not going to be working with some guy.  And then on a professional standpoint, that's the guy who I bounce off of.  That's the guy who gives me the friction.  You know, that's the guy who gives me, who gives my character, Ray, the energy.  And I was sort of thinking, so where do I get from here? 
[03:09:00]  Yeah, where are you from here?  What's going to fuel me now?  And I had to make some really quick decisions.  Just imagine if E-Rock left.  Right.  There would be no one to make fun of or nothing to look at and feel physically ill.  There's not a, there's nary a grin on his face.  He was behind that glass, just miserable, looking out, going, fuck you, Anthony.  But is everybody quiet on the set that day when they kill somebody off?  Yeah. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah, until lunch.  And they're like, hey, let's, that's cool.  Let's go.  Dude, they got fucking Mexican for lunch today.  Let's see the next script.  Is he hoping for dream sequences and shit where he can come back?  He took it well.  You know, last took it like a man, you know?  His mother-fuckers said dream sequences.  Hey, like Big Pussy.  Big Pussy.  Yeah.  What is it, Charlie's Angels?  So what happened?  He, you, uh, what was it like on the set as it was happening, as the scene was shot?  And then, like, they said, yeah, he's wrapped. 
[03:10:00]  It was, uh, it was a, it was a pretty emotional day, to be perfectly honest.  I mean, I remember, I think they, um, they did that the last day.  And, um, and, um, you know, it was just, no one really talked about it.  So we just, we all went to dinner that night.  Afterwards?  Well, yeah.  I mean, cause last, you know, Laz is a real gentleman.  Right.  You know, he, uh, he, he, he, he, he did what he wanted, he needed to do for the show and,  and, and, you know, took it like a man. 
[03:10:30]  Why did they do it?  There's just, it was just an important thing to do in the show to have one of the main guys  go.  Yeah.  It's just something that, that just happened from a creative standpoint.  It almost seems like shows now, and I credit HBO with this more, uh, I think with this,  with killing big pussy and the Sopranos is these guys, David, David Simon, David on the  wire.  He did it with, uh, what's that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I knew he said.  When he killed D'Angelo.  Oh God.  Yeah.  It's season six.  Uh, what was first?  That or big pussy? 
[03:11:00]  I thought, I think pussy was first, but I could be, that was the sixth episode of the second,  uh, yeah.  Big pussy.  I think was first.  Yeah.  How did big pussy die?  How did they kill him?  They fucking off the back of a boat.  They shot him.  Yeah.  Okay.  And then threw him in the water.  But it's like, now it's almost like you have to kill because life, because reality TV and  you understand how real life works, the heroes don't always make it.  Yeah.  And five or six or seven main guys in a, in a story like that, or Sopranos or wire where  there's gunfire all the time.  Yes.  Someone's going to have to.  D'Angelo represented hope. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, and there was no room for hope on, on the wire because he wanted to get out and  he wanted, he had a, if, if there was anybody who had the potential  to, to become something different than what, what he was presented at on the show.  Right.  It would be D'Angelo.  And yeah, I think David just nipped that in the bud.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Put a stop to that shit.  Like that's not, that's just a fucking sad day.  I don't think that's always the case.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think they, you know, there are many different reasons why people get off shows, you know? 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  Sometimes it's budget.  Sometimes you're like, look, we need to save that much money.  I couldn't believe they killed off the, uh, the character on Boardwalk Empire.  I don't know if anybody.  Oh my God.  But I couldn't believe that, that Jimmy got killed.  He was phenomenal, that dude.  Who'd they kill?  Big fan.  Jimmy Darmody.  Jimmy Darmody, yeah.  The end of season two.  I couldn't, because you think they're going to shoot the, uh, the Jewish, uh, Delegatessen  guy, that, that dude, the Jewish Kingpin.  We'll enforce that. 
[03:12:30]  And they fucking pop and fucking Buscemi pops Jimmy Darmody.  I couldn't fucking believe.  I think I went, ah!  That really bugged me.  That's a great performance on Steve's part.  Yeah.  You know, because he, he didn't play that guy.  You know, he played, he played, you know, you go do this and, you know, you go kill that  guy, but never really the guy pulling the trigger.  Gotta love Buscemi.  His whole, yeah, he's phenomenal.  I mean, I mean, plus his fucking teeth are the worst teeth in the business.  And he's just a superstar. 
[03:13:00]  I mean.  He's a talented director.  Fucking just unbelievable.  His mouth is literally, should just be fucking archived in a museum.  Yeah, he fucking rules, man.  I'm not going to debate you, Jerry.  Yeah.  Don't you always say that?  Jerry, this isn't a debate, Jerry.  I'm not going to debate you.  Yeah, yeah.  I love that.  I love Buscemi.  Fucking great.  That was Fargo.  He was fantastic at Fargo.  He's great.  Again, William A. Macy.  Hey.  Fargo.  Fan-fucking-tastic.  Oh, yeah.  I got the facts right here, yeah. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, the numbers are smudged, Jimmy.  Smudged the numbers.  That's right.  Well, okay, then.  We'll just...  Wait.  Wait, it's Gene.  Oh, geez, wait.  That's great.  He's practicing his phone call to Wade, and then he gets on, hello, I...  Yeah, I'll wait.  Like, nothing ever worked out for him.  Does this show shoot in New York City?  Um, it takes place in New York.  We shot this season.  First season, we shot in Toronto.  This past season, we shot in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. 
[03:14:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  Great town.  Yeah?  Yeah, I really enjoyed shooting there.  Do you, uh...  Do you go out and maybe partake in some nightlife every so often?  Uh, where?  Here in New York.  Anywhere, you know?  Because a lot of...  Some people go, like, no partying, I don't do anything.  Um...  No?  Not really.  Yeah?  You don't want any trouble on the set, right?  You don't want to do something in the fucking...  I just mean just being anywhere, you know, maybe...  I'll go out, I mean, you know, usual dinners and stuff like that, but I'm not on, like,  some dance floor in the club or...  I don't mean that either, like, but I just hear Baton Rouge is a pretty fun place to go 
[03:14:30]  out and maybe hit a bar or two.  You're an hour away from New Orleans.  Yeah.  Um...  Which is fun for five minutes.  Until you're like, all right, I gotta go home.  You're clocked on the side of the head as you're walking down the street.  Ah, it's just fucking awful.  You know, it's good during the day, it's kind of cool, but at night, it's like,  shut the fuck...  Yeah.  Woo!  Shut up, fucking beaded assholes.  I hate that women are fucking so uptight and they go to fucking Louisiana for plastic 
[03:15:00]  beads, they'll throw their dignity out a fucking window.  Go fuck...  If you look at those videos, too, it's always this hot college girl with a bunch of her  friend...  guy friends around her, right?  Yeah.  And she takes her...  She looks around, takes her shirt up, and then there's one black hand that will always  come in and grab a tit and shake it.  Oh, shit!  On all those girls...  Really?  Yeah, you see a black dude in the back waiting, waiting, she takes her shirt up and then just  grabs a tit, shakes it, and pulls it away.  A little quality control.  Hilarious.  And that's the crap services guy. 
[03:15:30]  That was supposed to be shitty.  Testing it out.  Is it cheaper shooting down there?  Oh, the rest of me.  Dom or me?  Are you shooting something here?  Yeah, I think Louisiana, I think that's why all these projects are going down to New  Orleans, Man Rouge, other parts of Louisiana, I think, because of the tax incentives.  This is smart.  Pittsburgh did the same thing.  It's like they're fucking New York and L.A. are losing...  L.A. is going to lose porn.  Detroit's got a lot of... 
[03:16:00]  New York's filming a lot, though.  New York's got a lot of shows.  New York went to Miami, right?  Probably because the fuck in L.A., now you have to wear condoms.  It's mandatory.  They voted it in porn.  And you still need the outdoor kind of beachy pool shots.  Well, it's just hot chicks more than that.  Yeah, but you know what?  If you're in L.A. and you're filming a porno, how many of them take place out by the pool?  You can get those hot chicks to live in Miami, too.  Yeah, no, I understand that.  That's probably why it's in Miami and not in, like, Montana.  Wait a minute.  I'm sick of seeing the...  You know.  I'm sick of seeing the pool. 
[03:16:30]  I think they watch a girl get fucked right against a dead tree.  You don't want to see, like, the leaves crunching under their feet.  Fucking love higher to the pool.  He likes that Russian porn.  Yeah, exactly.  Bane.  That Russian porn with some old car that was popular here, like, 30 years ago.  Detroit is...  She's got a wool skirt on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some blouse.  She has a blouse.  Fucking 18-year-old with a blouse and a wool skirt. 
[03:17:00]  Sucking big Russian vein dick.  You can put a quarter in his pee hole.  Just shoots jizz like a fire hose.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ, Robbie.  That's awesome.  And then Stevie Van Zandt shows up, and it's his new show on Netflix called Berrywood.  What the fuck is it called?  Lily Hammer.  Lily Hammer.  Berrywood.  What is it?  You even see that show?  I haven't.  Is it good?  Not this shit on the...  No, it stinks.  It's terrible.  Wow, really?  Is it?  Not this shit on the guy, but it's like, it's Stevie Van Zandt plays this mobster that 
[03:17:30]  goes in the witness protection program.  Does he have a bandana or the hair?  No, he's like...  It's basically a Sopranos character, but not the same name, right?  So they go, he goes, I'm going to give you up to, you know, I'm going to give you the  guy you need.  He goes, I want you to put me in Lily Hammer.  And they go, where the fuck is Lily Hammer?  And he goes, the fucking Olympics were there.  Beautiful snow, da, da, da, da, da.  And nobody's going to be looking for me.  And then like, right from that minute on, it's like, Lily Hammer isn't ready for this  crazy WAP. 
[03:18:00]  He's going to spin things around out here.  Oh, really?  It's a fish out of water?  Yeah.  I swear to God, there's a...  You stop moving, you move my microphone out.  I'm sorry, sorry.  Come on, Rodney.  Don't touch me either with those fingers.  Yeah, Lily Hammer, you're okay.  Every time he moves his chair, my microphone flies out of control.  There's a scene where he's in the car going to the airport and the FBI guy turns over from  the front seat and he goes, here's your file on your new identity. 
[03:18:30]  Your new name is Fernando Hendrickson.  So they gave him just an Italian first name and they just changed his last name to Hendrickson.  And it's so bad that you can't tell if that's supposed to be like a dumb joke.  Oh, are they really?  Is this funny or...  Is this a comedy?  It seems as shitty.  Is this a comedy?  It's supposed to be a comedy.  His next door neighbor is the chief of police.  What channel's it on?  And Lily Hammer is his name?  Giovanni Hendrickson.  Wait a minute.  Netflix has a...  Fernando. 
[03:19:00]  Fernando.  I couldn't say.  Yeah, that's not Italian.  That's Spanish.  Hey, I never said it was good on my feet.  Listen.  You keep standing up.  Yeah, Giovanni Hendrickson.  What channel's it on?  Netflix?  It was made by Netflix.  Oh, okay.  And it just stinks, man.  It's really bad.  It's never good.  The thing with it...  I'm going to have to stare at him tonight.  Netflix made it like it's just on your Netflix app thing.  Exclusive to Netflix.  I'll give it a shot.  I'll give any... 
[03:19:30]  I like shows like that.  People with a shit show.  I'll give it a shot.  I'll probably like it.  He makes that face...  Did you realize he makes that face?  Every scene he's like...  He's like doing...  You're like...  Yeah, it's the over-the-top like...  Gangsta face.  What happened to all those Soprano guys?  They were the fucking shit back then.  They're in every fucking commercial you turn on still, pretending to be mobsters.  Hey!  I don't mess around.  I'm not a wise guy when it comes to my laundry.  You try to tie up.  Don't fuck yourself. 
[03:20:00]  You guys get cars?  Go to the general.  This guy's no joke.  Oh, shit.  There's always some weird fucking reference.  Some whacked reference.  Oh, yeah.  Did you audition for the Soprano?  I did.  This close.  This is when I knew they didn't know what the fuck they wanted.  It was me, some 40-year-old dude, and Pat Cooper.  Pat Cooper?  Pat Cooper comes out of the audition and does this. 
[03:20:30]  You guys can go home.  I got it.  And does five minutes and kills the room.  The audition room.  He fucking levels it.  Everybody's on the ground.  He was on that.  He totally took me out of my fucking thing.  I go in, and I did all this crazy hand movement.  And the casting lady comes up.  She goes, listen, do it again, but don't move your hands.  Oh, you thought you were doing well with the hands?  Yeah.  It was a good scene.  They're going to love the hands.  I got killed, too, which is, you know, that's what everybody waited for us.  Pat Cooper coming off to analyze this? 
[03:21:00]  I don't know.  I don't know, but he fucking, he fucked me, dude.  He can be funny in any room, dude.  He killed in an audition.  He came out, oh, blah, blah, and just went off for five minutes.  Then the elevator went, ding, and he went, all right, take it easy.  Good luck, guys.  Break a leg.  And he was gone.  God bless.  God bless.  And then they go like this.  Robert, and I was like, I don't think I'm going to do this.  I got to go get some gabagol.  I got to go.  I got to go.  Bobby goes in there and starts making shadow puppets on the wall.  Yeah, do you know what show I did go in for that I thought I was so fucking going to get? 
[03:21:30]  And this is when I used to, remember I used to wear the baseball hat backwards all the time  when I had the goatee?  Fucking entourage.  I went in for Turtle.  I went in for Turtle.  And I'm like, you know when you get something, I'm like, I was probably auditioning.  It's just, you just mean.  It's just a mean asshole.  He's not even funny anymore.  It's just mean.  It's just mean.  I don't even have to think you're right.  It's just mean.  Yeah, that was nothing but mean.  It's not even like, you're just looking.  I thought you did get Turtle Gamera. 
[03:22:00]  He's got an old school Japanese monster creature double feature.  I get it.  Oh, shit.  That was just on the double.  I don't.  Come on, almost.  You can't be on my side and then jump on their side.  You're right.  You're either on their side or my side.  I'm sorry.  I'm coming back.  I'm sorry.  I'm on your side.  No, it's okay.  It was funny.  Gamera was funny.  I would be a good killer on Breakout Kings.  Oh, yeah?  I don't think I haven't been thinking about you, man.  What would you do?  Put his name in.  What would you do?  Come out of a hole in the ground? 
[03:22:30]  No, he would have to be the guy that the other guy sneaks out with.  And do all the dirty work.  You can do a scene where your character.  Hey, can you just put a rattle on the end of his fucking foot?  You can do a scene where your character gets hit with toxic waste.  He should be a C.  I'll get Jimmy comes out.  I like to have him on as a C.  Oh, my God.  Oh, fuck it.  Yeah, they've got to find a cure for that to get you back to normal. 
[03:23:00]  Hey, guys.  My sick brother's coming on the job this week.  He's got AIDS cancer.  I don't know how to come back.  Don't make fun of him.  Oh, fuck, man.  Oh, shit. 
[03:23:30]  Maybe.  I had a really good experience working with him, you know?  So every now and then, you know.  Where'd you guys work together?  Oh, now all of a sudden somebody lost it.  A show called Bork did that.  I can't believe they canceled.  That was a funny fucking episode, man.  I auditioned for that, too.  I auditioned for the fucking role.  Me and you went for the same thing.  Was it the same thing, or did you win for Dom's role?  I might have won it for his, but I fucking bombed.  Really? 
[03:24:00]  Yeah.  You know when you leave an audition and you're doing it in the elevator?  Yeah.  You're doing the right lines the way you should have did it in the elevator?  After the fact?  After you leave.  You know you bombed when you're in the elevator going, you shouldn't do that.  Don't fucking look at me.  Oh, shit.  I fucking.  That was the way.  Oh.  I went back in once.  I did that old.  You just thought it would be a Hollywood legend story someday?  Like, wow.  And then he went back in.  And if I didn't go back in, dude, I never would have got it.  I went back in.  I believed in myself, dude.  And all the story was, all the story was, this asshole came in and bombed again. 
[03:24:30]  In fact, sure.  He was born the second time.  They have the story now.  I'll never see him again for anything.  I took the elevator.  I literally, I hit the elevator button.  I hit the elevator button, like with, you know, pride.  And I went, I'm going back up.  And I hit three.  I went back up.  Did the elevator cry when it's three?  I went back into her office.  I walked by the sign in. 
[03:25:00]  I went right to her office.  I go, hey, listen, I really messed up.  Is there any way, I'd love to do that again for you.  She went, no.  Oh, no.  I'm good.  We're fine.  And I went, really?  She goes, no, I know.  We're fine.  I went, the second elevator ride, I wanted to kill myself.  The first one.  Huh?  You ever just walk out of the room?  I have, yeah.  I have, like, walk in.  No.  And then walk right out.  Like, look around and walk out?  No, like, look at them.  Uh-huh.  And walk out.  No.  Oh, yeah.  She's never did that. 
[03:25:30]  They asked me to.  But I walked in.  Why?  Why?  Just.  I'm not going to mention what it was.  Just give them a look and.  Really?  Just walked in.  I wish I had in.  And said, you know what?  Today's just not the day.  Not going to work.  And walked right out.  Really?  Why?  You just didn't feel it?  I just didn't feel it.  I thought you were just acting with your face and figured you'd get the role just going,  like, ah, I'm looking at them.  They'll walk out.  They go.  She's brilliant.  The hard look, yeah.  What's the most important thing to you when you get a script?  Is it to learn the dialogue immediately and then go from there? 
[03:26:00]  Or do you start to get, like, the emotion or whatever?  Or do you want to learn the words first?  Because some guys don't want to be off book completely.  You know.  All the auditions, I'm off book.  Just because that's just my process.  It's easier for me to be comfortable that way.  Right.  Memorizing the lines and knowing the lines are two different things.  When you memorize the lines, then you're able to play around with the lines and then 
[03:26:30]  have fun with what you're doing.  To me, it's a very instinctual thing.  It's, you know, you could prepare for a scene.  You could say, I'm going to do this.  I'm going to do that.  And then when you're on the set, you don't know what's coming at you.  Right.  So I never really set anything in stone.  You've got to adjust.  Oh, right.  Be able to, you know.  But auditioning, having the gig and auditioning are two different fucking animals.  I mean, getting the gig and the audition room and the second one, but being honest, in 
[03:27:00]  the set, it's like they fuck around the thing.  I mean, they, they, like the, the two, two that you can, they change that shit all the  time.  You can make shit up.  Things happens.  It's actually funner and easier, more relaxed, but auditioning.  It's like they want you to fucking.  That's the hardest part of the job.  Yeah.  That's the shit one.  And do you, do you just, do you go off?  Like, like, do you learn it and say them exactly the way they're written?  No.  Or do you, not you, dubby.  Or do you allow yourself to, how do you allow yourself to fucking, to go off a little bit 
[03:27:30]  if you, you know what I mean?  I try, I try to be respectful and, and stick to what's on the page.  But if I'm in an audition and I happen to miss something, I'm not going to sweat it.  Right.  I'll change words though.  If it feels like if they say, um, why are we going to do that?  I'm comfortable saying things like, you know, do you think we should do that?  Why would we do that?  Like, like little things that make it your own.  It's more natural.  It's easier to do.  Because you, you, you know, that, that's you being human and you making it sound real. 
[03:28:00]  Some words are hard for me to deliver it the same way.  Why are you doing that?  Well, I, and I'll actually do this with my head and make the question mark.  I think I'm so married to the, but I, I had to do this thing recently where the line was,  uh, toss my room regularly.  My mom would toss my room regularly and that's hard for me to say.  Some words are just hard for me.  Like, you know, toss my room, right?  It's just like a room.  So I had to, I had to switch that up a little bit.  Would you keep saying salad?  My head.  Mother fucker. 
[03:28:30]  I hate you.  You cocksucker.  I was slow drawing that.  I had it right there.  And you fucking, if I had seen your face, I would have known you.  Why would my salad toss my room?  Oh, Jimmy.  Who's that?  I was right there.  Toss my salad.  Cocksucker, Anthony.  I wanted that line so bad.  Sorry, Bobby.  That's funny.  I remember, I got, I got a salad doesn't come in or go out of your mouth.  God almighty.  I know. 
[03:29:00]  It's terrible.  He couldn't pick a salad out of a lineup.  What'd you come up with?  Oh, I don't remember.  I did a bunch of, we did a bunch of different ways.  I said room regularly.  And I just said my mother would always fucking go through my room.  Regularly.  Regularly.  It's not natural for me to say regularly.  Although I have, I was, I was voted boy with best diction in town.  No, you weren't.  Yes, I was.  Two years in a row.  Are you, are you just offer only now?  Or do you have to still audition?  Well, I auditioned.  Not you, dumb, dumb.  You really do look like a fucking shrunken hymn. 
[03:29:30]  So yeah, are you offer only?  Oh, no, no.  You'll audition?  Yeah, of course.  I would hate to see him in an audition.  You're like, we're both, you know, I have short hair, he has short hair.  If they thought we'd be sure we're off with the same cop part.  It's a hard process for me.  You know?  What cop part would you go for, Jim?  But you know, they just, they send you on a, whatever.  Dog cop.  But it was just, when you see like a real actor, you're like, oh, you fucking shit.  That's the worst. 
[03:30:00]  You do have that definitive cop kind of look and attitude when you're acting, the voice,  everything.  So that, the, you know, the, the cop, the friend.  Yeah, yeah.  The fucked up friend, you know.  Well, who'd you play in Bronx Tale?  Oh.  Nikki Zero.  Oh, right.  Selling the guns.  Yep, yep, yep.  Holy shit.  Selling the guns.  Fucking A.  I just saw that again.  I didn't realize it was you.  I didn't realize it was you.  I just saw.  I had hair in here.  Can I look you up for me? 
[03:30:30]  I was 15.  Holy shit.  You were 15 in that?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  I'll be the 36 this month.  That's fucking hilarious.  I love when I see famous bald people.  It just gives, you know what I mean?  Like, I like seeing famous fat people.  Like, when that chick won the Oscar, I was like, good.  But when I see bald guys, it's like, ah, it's like hope.  Like, maybe I could get something.  I actually, seriously, Dane Cooks had his sitcom, his pilot.  He just picked up a pilot, didn't he?  He picked up another one, yeah.  Yeah, he just got one.  He, he, his best friend, Robert, it was literally written, it was me. 
[03:31:00]  It was my, my voice, my lines, shit I've said.  It was down to me and three other guys.  And Sony said to him, ah, and he goes, what is it?  Because he's bald?  They go, we like hair at Sony.  Oh.  They actually said that.  It was like, yeah, we kind of like hair.  It's the Kramer Kramer thing from, uh, from Seinfeld.  We kind of like hair.  The real Kramer couldn't play Kramer.  That means fucking I'm bald and they don't want to fucking do it.  Which one are you, Dom?  No, he's the guy that sold him the, uh. 
[03:31:30]  That sold him the guns.  I want to see a picture of you from him.  Sold him the guns.  Yeah, I'm trying to find it.  Type his name.  Why don't you just, uh, Google it and then put image Google, Dominic Lombardozzi, and then  hit, uh, what's that?  Nicky Zero.  Why did Nicky Zero Bronx Tale image and it didn't, how do you spell your name, Dom?  It's right there.  He's actually doing, uh, the one man show.  I've seen it.  I've seen it.  Which, which, just him.  Everybody's, it's an amazing show.  I've seen it. 
[03:32:00]  I've seen it.  It was amazing.  He came by here last time he was doing it.  He's just fucking fantastic.  He's a great guy.  It was unbelievable, that show.  He spits a lot when he does it.  Oh, yeah, we made Rich Voss act, uh, with him.  We told Voss he was doing a scene.  We talked about this last time.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Because he was just in, like, two weeks before that.  Yeah, fucking hilarious.  Yeah, Voss, what did he do?  Stunk.  Yeah, Voss just was horrible.  We told Voss it was going to be me and him doing a Bronx Tale, like he's a goof.  So he was, like, actually looking at the script and getting nervous.  And then as we're at the microphones, I brought Chaz in from the fucking dressing room and he 
[03:32:30]  had to do this scene with Chaz Palminteri.  He was nervous thinking he was going to do it.  Just Jimmy just had to have to do the part.  And it's actually fucking Chaz Palminteri comes in.  Did you hear it?  It's really bad.  It's fucking hilarious.  Loley beans.  Loley beans.  I want to hear that.  You're reading, John.  Oh, fuck.  He really was trying to act because he thought that Chaz might be, like, not bad.  DeRuss, you ever hear it?  No, I would love to fucking hear it.  Oh, it's terrible.  You know what?  Let's just, we might as well.  We're here.  We're not going to hear it. 
[03:33:00]  Let's, uh, yeah, give it a play there, Iraq.  I can't hear it.  No, John is the name because that was the name.  Headphones on.  It's not sunny.  I got right behind you.  Right behind you.  The name John was from the play.  It's not sunny.  Yeah, yeah.  There's a couple of little things that have changed.  In the play, his name is John.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Okay.  Ready?  Yeah.  Oh, that's better.  There it is.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Let's go.  All right.  Here we go.  Go ahead.  Louie, Beans, I want my money.  Beans, you can't dodge me forever.  Oh, God.  See, what are you doing?  Come on.  What are you yelling about?  John, I got a problem with this guy over here.  Louie Beans, this guy owes me 20, and it's been two weeks now, and every time he sees 
[03:33:30]  me, he keeps dodging me, John.  Should I crack him one or what?  Listen, see, come on.  Sometimes violence is not the answer.  Is he a good friend of yours or not?  Nah, John, I don't even like him.  Well, there's your answer right there.  Look at it this way.  It costs you $20 to get rid of him.  He's never going to ask you for money again.  He's never going to bother you again.  He's out of your life for $20.  Come on.  You got to have cheap.  You're right, John.  You're always right.  How do you know the right answer all the time, Johnny?  Well, I try to keep my eyes and ears open all the time, and I read. 
[03:34:00]  You read?  Yeah, I read.  Come on.  Let's go to Mario's next door and get something.  What do you read?  You know, I read things.  You know, I read philosophy.  Philosophy?  You read philosophy?  Come on, John.  Sure.  You read a Machiavelli?  Come on, John.  Come on, John.  There's so fucking great.  The tone is the same.  There's not up and down.  There's no emotion.  Come on, John.  No colors. 
[03:34:30]  Chaz is so fucking smooth.  He's just like, well, come on.  He's so good.  And then, hello, he's being.  You read time.  Jesus.  It's Mark and Veli.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Now we know why he's fucking working restaurants and the Catskills.  He literally acts like in a sitcom when the principal at the last minute has to jump into the school play.  The fucking worst, man. 
[03:35:00]  He stinks.  Just no fucking instinct.  Incredibly bad.  It just goes to show how hard that is to do.  It's easy.  Is it really?  When you got the gift, man.  Is it the gift?  Is it the gift, Jimmy?  Yeah.  The whole thing.  Your teeth are just waiting.  Hold that gift back.  That's fantastic.  What, are you talking about a fucking silent film face?  That's when Jim does his best acting with a train coming. 
[03:35:30]  With a fucking ragtime piano playing in the background.  His fucking face actor.  America's sweetheart.  Oh, what do we got?  All right.  Well, I'll do this after we should.  Oh, my God.  Oh, I forgot to mention.  It's after 10.  Yeah.  Shit.  Tickets went on sale five minutes ago for the June 9th show I'm doing with Artie Lang,  David Tell, Nick DiPaolo, and myself, the antisocial comedy chore. 
[03:36:00]  Jesus Christ, that's a show.  June 9th at Foxwoods in Nantucket, Connecticut.  Wow.  The MGM.  That will sell out.  It sold out last year.  Once there's a man from there.  What's that?  Glad Artie's back.  Huh?  Glad Artie's back.  He's doing great.  He's doing so happy.  I'm a big fan.  Really big fan.  I always wanted to do a show with Artie Lang.  Yeah.  I wanted to, because we know some of the same people.  I'm like, it would be great to do a sitcom with him.  I finally saw.  I really threw that out there. 
[03:36:30]  I finally saw Artie when you guys were playing the show at the Borgata.  That was the first time you saw him.  The first time I ever saw Artie.  He is fucking funny, man.  He's fucking, one of the funniest guys, but one of the nicest guys in the business, too.  I loved him.  Barely.  He's a great guy.  I didn't see that.  You didn't see Barely?  He's a great guy.  One of the nicest guys in the business.  One of the nicest guys.  He would give you the shirt from his back.  How about this?  He's the nicest guy on that show.  How hard is that to be?  He's the most psychologically stable, too. 
[03:37:00]  The reception for him was fucking amazing.  Yeah, man.  Amazing.  The crowd fucking.  Did he get married?  No, no.  Not the reception.  Oh.  Baby.  The crowd reception was fucking fantastic.  I get it.  I know.  But let me just finish my sentence.  Yeah, people are really happy to see him back on his feet.  I mean, that show is fucking.  It's not as big as my show at Mgooby's next weekend.  Oh.  Wait, why is it not?  Yes, it is.  Again.  Again, he gets hit.  Well, I'm going to Baltimore.  Baltimore, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah.  I think your Mgooby shows will be good.  But whereas you're playing one venue, I'll be playing several on my Southeastern Any Which  Way But Lose Tour.  Any Which Way But Lose Tour.  That starts this Tuesday.  You should get an old truck, a case of Budweiser, and a fucking rag attack.  Yeah.  Right turn, Clyde.  This cogsucker.  What's that girl got on?  Her mind.  Yeah.  And, of course, Dominic Lombardozzi, right?  Yes.  Yeah. 
[03:38:00]  Breakout Kings.  Breakout Kings, season two.  It's in progress.  Sundays at 10 o'clock on A&E.  But you can, I guess, go on demand, too, if you miss an episode.  Yeah, yeah.  That's so fucking cool now.  You just, hey, I want to watch this now.  You can go back home.  First season DVDs are coming out pretty soon.  Oh, really?  And you can watch the first season, I believe, online.  On Netflix?  Fantastic.  Not Netflix.  On demand.  Get cable.  What's wrong with you?  I have the fucking ultimate cable.  You do?  I called the guy last night at two in the morning.  My thing's fucked up.  Okay.  Fixed it right from where the fuck he was. 
[03:38:30]  Which cable was that, Favos?  No, it's the Time Warner Supreme.  Time Warner.  No, the news didn't.  High up.  It stinks.  It stinks.  But it's.  Here's my Time Warner when I'm watching a movie.  So, what do you think he should buy?  It just skips.  It's pixelated.  That's because you're sucking cock while you're watching TV.  No, it's not me making that noise.  It's the TV.  It's the fucking TV, you jerk off.  Hey, asshole. 
[03:39:00]  Go fuck your mother.  You piece of shit.  You don't like Time Warner, Dice?  I hate.  Time Warner cable.  It's like a hoa that won't fuck.  That's good of you.  Get the fuck out of my house, you cunt.  Right, Dice.  Yes.  That's fucking brilliant.  You're still reacting like it's him saying.  I know.  I can't help it.  It's just the way. 
[03:39:30]  Fuckin' Anthony's possessed.  Hey.  Jake golf.  Holy shit.  Do you like Fios, Dice?  You into Fios?  Hey, Fios is the good one.  That's the one like a hoa that grabs your balls and plays at them while you guz guz in  the fuckin' face, you piece of shit.  Hey, Dice, what about those Central American fuckin' chicks who wear the derby hats?  Oh, the derby hat girls from South America? 
[03:40:00]  Where they from?  Guadalajara?  I don't know.  They wear the hat.  They carry the coffee beans on their back.  And they fuck Alexa Hentai's donkey.  And they're good.  Like Dice.  Hey, Dice.  Do you know about Joseph Cody?  Hey, Anthony has to talk tonight, okay?  This hurts his throat.  What, are you on a table or something, Dice?  Oh, Chip, shut up.  I hate Chip.  Jesus Christ, dude. 
[03:40:30]  At least we got rid of that other one.  God damn it, man.  The other one was the worst.  You know what?  We're going to wrap up.  But I'll be back for a read after, like, Iraq plays a quick thing, right?  Yes, we will.  That way we, you know, start fresh with a read.  I got you.  I don't like doing reads in front of, like, real actors.  We shouldn't be here in the room.  Ah, yeah, yeah.  Get some tips.  Do the read.  Get some tips.  Ah!  Get some tips from an actor.  No, Rachel, tonight on FX.  No, I'll do it later. 
[03:41:00]  Can I see what it is?  I want this one to see what it's for.  It's, uh...  What the hell is it?  Palopanies.  Palopanies.  No, Rachel, you've come back.  That's my favorite show.  It's fucking great, isn't it?  I love it.  I got the box set.  I take it on the roll with me all the time.  And you can watch the same episodes all the time and still laugh just as hard.  I watch them all the time.  The Honeymooners.  Oh.  Classic episodes.  Hilarious.  Trying to get the lost one.  There's a new box set out of all the ones. 
[03:41:30]  Because I had the classic 39 one.  And there's a new box set out with all the other shit.  The lost episode.  I got the movie with the black guy where he actually does hit her at the end.  He goes to the moon and cracks her right in the head.  When they made that movie, Cedric Tater goes, he goes, I took out all the stuff where he says  he's going to hit her because I didn't think that was right.  And it's like, oh, you mean the part I die for in every episode?  Yeah, everything.  The thing I fucking wait for the whole time?  I look under his brother and he goes, you're 30 years old. 
[03:42:00]  He like shakes his fist.  He wants to punch her in the face.  Here's the thing.  He doesn't, in the classic 39's, he never says the thing about to the moon.  He never goes, he goes.  It was a different show.  He never goes, one of these days, pal, right in the kisser.  He never says that.  What episode?  When does he say that to her?  Because he doesn't say it in any of the classic ones.  He would go, he'd look at her and go, bang, zoom.  That's all he would do.  When you say classics, you're talking about the lost tapes?  The box set we were just talking about, like the classic 39 episodes or whatever.  He never says, one of these days, pal, right in the kisser. 
[03:42:30]  Yes, he does.  Look at this.  Joe, you're wrong.  I believe him.  Even though you're one of my best friends, I don't like you anymore.  I'm actually scared to argue with him right now.  Joe, you have those glasses on.  You can argue with anybody.  Doug's literally going like this.  He's going, no, yes, he does.  I've heard him go, bang, zoom.  I've heard him go, pal, right in the kisser.  And I've heard him go, you're going to do that on the moon.  But he doesn't go, bang, yeah, I'm telling you.  He doesn't sit down, Joe.  He used to say, to the moon.  Did he ever say, bang, what, bang, zoom, to the moon? 
[03:43:00]  He doesn't go, this is the one he says.  That's it.  That's such a great line.  Hey, there.  I'm going to hit you so hard.  He was so ahead of his time.  I'm going to hit you so hard, you're going to go to another planet.  That's how hard I'm going to hit you.  Well, the moon is technically not a planet.  Well, it's a satellite.  So are you.  My favorite.  Really?  You fucking asshole.  I know, Bobby.  He's a sata heavy.  All right.  Tag.  All right. 
[03:43:30]  I'm good.  A sata heavy.  I don't like this fucking lizard and this midlife crisis.  I'm not even giving me a shame at the end of the line here.  I'm sorry, Simon.  I know.  What do you think?  He's going to be 106?  Hey, wait a minute.  I could do some math.  That's not right.  Yeah.  I'll do the read now because tonight on FX, I didn't know it was tonight, catch the special  premiere event of The Ultimate Fighter live.  The coaches are UFC favorite and bitter rivals, Uriah Faber and Dominic Cruz. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah.  And they're going to coach their teams to survive in the octagon.  It's every Friday on FX.  It's live, too.  It's live this year.  I think every show is.  The fights are live.  It's just every Friday night you'll see a live fight.  Yeah.  There you go.  And go inside and outside locker rooms, which has never been done before because the fights  are always pre-taped.  And, you know, I guess nobody ever has a spoiler, but these are actually live.  This is going to be great.  I love what FX is doing with the UFC.  I do, too.  And it's good for all the shows that are on FX to have them there.  Yeah. 
[03:44:30]  32 fighters from all over the world with different backgrounds.  You're going to fight their way into the house and have the unique opportunity to train  with professional trainers and fellow housemates.  The pressure mounts as the fighters are shut off from the outside world with no contact,  family, or loved ones.  The drama unfolds in the house that the guys who live together, it's like every reality  show.  You want fucking all alpha males with no contact to anything female or anything that helps  spell disaster, right?  No phones, nothing.  No.  That's how the thing started.  That should just end with a guy rape in a closet. 
[03:45:00]  These guys come with their fists.  The drama unfolds in the house as the guys who live together and train together become  opponents, vying for the chance to earn a UFC contract and become the next Ultimate Fighter.  Don't miss the special premiere event of The Ultimate Fighter live tonight at 9 o'clock  only on FX.  And Faber and Cruz really are rivals.  And I'm very psyched about this.  Yeah, Cruz actually, when they were doing a thing for charity, he was signing over Faber's 
[03:45:30]  face on the poster.  Oh, really?  That's an insult.  You're here for charity, you sign it, and he just looks over at his face, has the other  guy's name on it.  Was he joking?  No, he was just being a dick.  He's like, go fuck yourself.  Right on his face.  Good job being a dick, yeah.  Yeah.  They really do hate each other.  All right, gentlemen, thanks so much for coming in.  Always a pleasure.  You guys are hilarious.  Thanks.  This was a blast.  Always have fun with you guys.  And it's Springsteen tonight.  Oh, yeah.  We're going to be there.  Boo.  Well, I was going to the Hasberry Puff. 
[03:46:00]  Guys, this is my wife.  Give it up.  Ugh.  Three fucking hours.  Roland's saying this could go on for three hours.  It's a very big, serious event.  Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da with the fucking horns and three hours of,  I love America, but I don't mean it.  I'm being ironic.  Well, I mean, I love Levi's jeans.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da 
[03:46:30]  Nah.  All right, everybody.  So have a great day.  And, of course, Breakout King Sunday, Sunday at 10 o'clock on A&E. 
[03:47:00]  And hasta maÃ±ana.  See you Monday.  Or Monday, maybe.  You next.  You've heard about it.  You've waited four long hours for it.  And now the moment you've waited for rears its ugly nose.  Head after Opie and Anthony Live is coming up next.  Serious XR.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After Opie and Anthony Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts. 
[03:47:30]  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Four hours of radio and not a phone call.  I wonder who is hosting today.  Fabulous show by Anthony Cumia.  Flying solo as he's going to be flying solo today.  And all of next week, Opie left for his vacation.  So it was just Ant and Jim today.  Along, of course, with the greats Bob Kelly and Joe DeRosa.  It's very funny. 
[03:48:00]  Ant just doesn't like talking to you guys.  I don't know what it is.  But he doesn't.  I mean, he's active on Twitter.  So he likes that you exist.  He likes you listening.  But there's just something in his DNA that he does not want to hear from you.  He does not want your voice invading his show.  I mean, I can understand it.  I get it.  But I don't know how that makes you feel.  I don't know if that means that maybe you guys need to start stepping your game up as listeners, as callers. 
[03:48:30]  You know, because you can't blame him.  He knows what's best for the show.  Anthony Cumia is the one who's been doing this for years upon years.  He's the professional here.  Not you guys.  So I think that's something.  That's a flaw that you have to examine in yourselves.  Because today's show, let's face it, was gangbusters.  Okay?  It was a fantastic show.  And it was without phone calls. 
[03:49:00]  Okay, Roland has been walking around here like a kid on his last day of school before summer vacation.  It's like he had too much sugar.  It's like summer vacation is today.  Yes.  Bobby Kelly.  Travis was making fun of you again for calling him.  Remember we talked about this before?  What do you mean?  How Travis makes fun of you for just calling him to talk?  I like Travis.  I woke this morning.  The first thing he said to me. 
[03:49:30]  We rode up the elevator together.  Okay.  And I've talked about this before.  Too much details.  No, no, no, no.  This is what we do.  I've talked about this before.  I like riding the elevator by myself.  Are we on the shit show right now?  No, it's called After Opie and Anthony Live.  Oh, okay.  Yep.  But he told me, yeah, Bobby called me again last night.  And he goes, Bob, it was talking to me.  Somebody get Joe in here.  Bob was talking to me.  He's just standing out there waiting.  No, he's not booked.  I only booked Bob Kelly.  Oh, I'm sorry.  He's not booked on the show.  No, he's not booked.  He's not booked. 
[03:50:00]  Come on in, you fuck.  He has a lesbian, alternative lesbian face.  But Travis says that you guys were talking for 20 minutes about electronics.  I love when Bob calls.  And then he said, Bob, why are you calling me?  And your response was, oh, I don't know.  I just wanted to see what the talking points were for tomorrow.  Yeah.  How long have you been doing the show?  Dude, I was being sarcastic.  That's not the way Travis told the story.  What, did you think I was serious?  I knew he was being sarcastic.  That's not the way you told the story.  But that's the reason why he called.  For the talking points.  Yeah.  To sarcastically ask. 
[03:50:30]  Stupid.  First of all.  Why'd you call?  I literally called to say, what's up?  You like Bob.  And I like that he does that.  First of all.  No, you don't.  You make fun of him every time he does that.  That doesn't mean I don't like it.  You come to work and say, fucking Bob Kelly keeps calling me.  What a loser.  You call me a loser?  He never said that.  Yes, he does.  You call me a loser?  Yes.  I've never said that.  You know I would never say that.  Stop for a second.  You asked me a question.  Did he call me a loser?  Roland has no idea what's going on.  Look at me.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, I know you like.  He's got Springsteen tickets.  He's all hyped up on energy.  Listen, horns. 
[03:51:00]  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah, you know what Sam does.  He instigates.  Listen, first of all, you know I was kidding about talking points.  That's a joke.  You know that, right?  You see what I'm saying?  I've done this show longer than you.  I know when Opie's away, I know that Anthony's not going to whip out talking points.  There's not that much show prep going on with fucking.  I'm just saying, listen, you did four.  Next week is the easiest week for us.  You did four and a half hours of radio and took zero callers.  Can I be exact? 
[03:51:30]  I love that, by the way.  Yeah.  But here's the deal.  I remember when I first started doing O&A, though, I would actually wake up and read the paper.  Would you write things down?  Because when we first started, when you guys were at the other place, you were there at the radio station.  We were at 57th Street.  Right when they came back, we had to go to two places.  Oh, when we were on K-Rock.  And you would have to show up at K-Rock at like a quarter of six.  If you were doing the.  Quarter to six.  If you.  Wait, let me.  Sam and I used to be there at four in the morning.  No, the guests.  When you first started, they would say, all right, show up at quarter of six or 530. 
[03:52:00]  Because you would do shit.  They were like, we're going to do show prep.  And everyone would have a newspaper.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right?  Everyone would have a newspaper.  In the office.  In the office.  In the office.  And someone would say, well, what do you think about this?  And that's it.  That's show prep.  That was it.  That was fun.  What?  I used to love sitting in the office.  Do you know what show prep is now?  Like, even when Obie's here or whatever.  Yeah.  Obie's here.  Obie's here at quarter to six.  Yeah.  Anthony's here, say, ten to six.  Yeah. 
[03:52:30]  Travis and me, we used to get here at 430.  We're now squeaking in at 530.  Right.  Um, and it's just, it's not, we talk to them a minute before they go on the air and throw  some shit at them and say, talk about it if you want.  K-Rock, K-Rock was the end of, of.  A radio show.  A collective show prep.  Yeah, yeah.  Because you don't need it.  Everybody's a professional.  You know how to fucking talk about something.  Bring up a topic.  Go ahead, Sam.  Any topic.  Go.  Watch me.  K-Rock sniffing Joe's balls.  Oh, fucking Christ, man.  What the hell was that? 
[03:53:00]  What was that?  And K-Rock over here is saying, oh, I'll do it.  Eric.  Yeah, because.  I mean, first of all, it's interesting.  Maybe Iraq likes smells like gasoline.  People like markers, sharpies.  He likes scents.  He likes scents.  So maybe that's his thing.  Maybe it wasn't a fucking sexual thing.  Or maybe he likes balls.  Maybe that's his thing.  Maybe it's both.  Maybe it's a fucking, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's an infinity little thing.  I can think of at least a dozen things that Eric has protested longer than, hey, come  smell Joe's balls.  Like what?  Like coming to work on time. 
[03:53:30]  Like, I don't need to get here at 530.  Yeah, I'll sniff his balls.  Like we had to, we had to convince Eric.  Like not eating a third piece of cake.  Yeah.  That's just mean.  We've had to convince him to like, you know.  Oh, there he is.  Sorry.  I thought he was gone.  It's not mean if he's not there.  You were really quick.  I thought that was behind your back, Iraq.  I'm sorry.  No, I actually waited until Jim, he's just going like this.  What did you say?  I was waiting.  I just stood in here.  I'm like, no, we got to go break.  We don't really have to do this.  And Jim's getting that face where his teeth clenched together and he's waving.  Get in here. 
[03:54:00]  Yeah.  How about this?  You've done things.  No matter how angry Jim's face is, I'm not sniffing another guy's balls today.  Oh, Jim's angry.  I was surprised Jim wouldn't do it.  Why?  He never does that.  He doesn't give up.  He never does that.  He wouldn't do anything?  No, he's not going to do that unless he's paying you.  Yeah, exactly.  Unless he's giving you five bills on a fucking nightstand.  Joe, were you creeped out that Eric was so quick to be like, I'll sniff those balls?  No.  I regret terribly.  Bobby and I have discussed this Fresh Balls product for a while. 
[03:54:30]  Which I totally backfired.  Are they sponsoring your podcast?  No.  They should be.  The guy, Brooke, he sent me a package of it, a bunch of it, to try out.  They used to sponsor the show.  Yeah, I know.  Look, I fucking love it.  I think it's great.  I like being fresh.  I wasn't freaked out at all.  I was fucking pushing you to let me do it.  Yeah, I know.  That's what's freaking me out.  That was weird.  I was, but in my head, I was like, if we ever do this smell each other's balls thing, 
[03:55:00]  I'm going to kiss Bobby's balls.  That was your fantasy.  And watch him leap up in the air.  And then I just didn't do it.  I got scared that he was going to get mad, and I just chickened out.  I'm like so mad I didn't do it now.  First of all, baby girl, I would never get mad at you for that.  That's beautiful.  Bobby wouldn't flinch.  But while we're sitting here.  That would freak me out.  Would it?  If I felt his little fucking Arabian lips on my balls.  I should have done this.  Dude, Eskimo kissed my balls. 
[03:55:30]  Damn it.  Why did I do that?  We're sitting here saying, why is E-Rock?  E-Rock was so quick to sniff balls.  And Joe's like, not only do I not regret being quick, my regret is that I didn't get in closer  and use my mouth.  Yeah.  No.  Just watch a guy fucking yelp.  It's so funny, man.  I've got some regrets.  He wanted to put it in his mouth like a hard-boiled egg and just hold it.  Yeah.  It was the hardest I ever laughed in my fucking life.  I was peeing with my friend Mark in a bathroom, and we were drunk, and he's like, check out 
[03:56:00]  my balls, dude.  And he goes, I dare you to touch one.  And I reached over, and I squeezed one of his balls like that while he was peeing.  Dude, we were laughing so fucking hard.  Is that funny to you, Bob?  Is this a comedian thing I'm missing?  That's funny.  You're gay, Travis.  It works out that way.  There's funny things that do in that.  Travis is a gay.  His body is.  I don't know.  And his beard.  And his whole head is just like, he was a gay teacher.  Don't talk about his wife like that.  Oh, you mean the beard he has? 
[03:56:30]  Okay.  There's funny things you do in the bathroom.  Like what?  Like back at 57th Street when you used to walk into the bathroom, and Jim would be there at  the urinal with his pants literally down to his ankles taking a piss.  That's funny.  Yeah, but Joe, he talked about it on the podcast.  But it doesn't mean you shove your finger up his ass and say it's a joke.  Well, no.  Joe used to do fucked up shit in college.  He used to do, what was that thing with your friend where you'd, hey, everyone,  I'd go out of the room.  I'd wait until everybody was like from our hall, like from our whole wing was all in 
[03:57:00]  one dorm room.  Because they'd always hang out in my friend Jim's room, and they'd all be watching football  or whatever the fuck they were doing.  And I would sneak out.  And I would set this up with my friend Jim, but he was the only one that knew I was going  to do it.  I'd sneak out.  I'd strip down naked in the hallway.  And I'd knock on the door.  And Jim would be like, who could that be?  And he'd open the door, and he'd be like, hey, everybody, look, it's Joe and his cock.  And I'd come dancing in, pulling on my cock.  And I'm like, hey, everybody.  Are you proud of your cock?  No.  So you'd just use it for comic relief.  I mean, it's not shameful.  Every once in a while, Joe would send me a picture, random. 
[03:57:30]  And it's come up.  I'm talking to Esty, the lady who books the cellar.  Sure.  I'm literally at the bar talking to her about some shit.  And a photo of him will come up with just his cock out, like from his balls up, like  some artsy Instagram photo of his helmet.  Do you think that's a little gay?  Or funny?  There's something about Joe that doesn't make you gay.  We've done that a bit on the show.  Gay or funny?  Yeah.  I think it's funny.  Like, to me, it stopped being funny when E-Rock said, well, when you push, I didn't get 
[03:58:00]  any ball on my face, but I did feel the swipe of hair brushing across my cheek.  That's pubic hair brushing across his cheek.  Across my nose and eyes.  From a man.  When I used to live with Jay Oakerson, I used to live with Jay Oakerson.  And one time, he was sitting at the computer.  Uh-huh.  And I snuck up behind him.  I took my cock out.  I put it, like, right on his fucking shoulder.  Uh-huh.  And I kept being like, Jay, turn around, turn around.  And he was like, kept being like, no, stop.  Like, he didn't know what I was doing.  He just thought, like...  Did you think it was your hand? 
[03:58:30]  He didn't feel it.  It was just kind of resting there.  What a cock do you have?  It's very light.  It feels like a hand.  Well, it was short enough that this happened.  He finally turned and went, what?  And my fucking dick just went across his cheek.  Ah.  That's just funny.  You think that's funny?  That's not good.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Which one would you want to be?  You'd want to be Joe.  No, I think he'd want to be Jay.  No, you'd want to be Joe.  You'd want to be Joe.  I don't want to be the guy that's being done, too.  I think Travis would want to be Jay. 
[03:59:00]  Travis does want to be Jay.  No.  You're hilarious, Joe.  Yeah, he wants the tip of a cock to rub over his lip and leave, like, a trail of pre-jizz.  Yeah.  Like, like, Blistex.  Yeah.  Snail trail.  The new Blistex that really leaves your lips shining.  Travis would do the prank and not realize why nobody thought it was funny because Travis was  fully erect when he was doing it.  If Travis had a dick rub across his lip, he'd do that thing where women put too much makeup  on and they rub their lips together and they put it on a napkin. 
[03:59:30]  I just think the stories are funny.  I wouldn't want it to be happening to me.  Who's the gayest in the room right now?  Travis.  In the room?  The gayest in the room.  I don't want to say Travis.  I wouldn't say Joe.  I'd say Sam.  How is that?  I don't have a thing for listening to your voice.  I don't have a thing for trannies.  I don't have a thing for...  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I don't have a thing for trannies either.  I don't have a thing for a particular tranny.  It's two different fucking ballparks.  I'm not sitting here talking about how much I wish I had more experience putting dicks  on people's shoulders.  I don't say I wish I had more experience. 
[04:00:00]  So you're saying it's down to Joe and Travis?  I would think so.  Okay, you're not even in the mix.  No.  Really?  Eric smelt his balls.  Yeah.  Yet this is the guy who's deep-throated a dildo that's been attached to Eric.  I wasn't deep-throated.  You deep-throated a dildo.  I put it in my mouth, but I didn't deep-throat it.  Why?  Because you couldn't?  Well, yeah.  I mean, I'm not experienced enough, Travis, to deep-throat something.  How did the weight of it feel in your mouth, like on your tongue?  It felt unnatural.  It's the first thing I wonder.  Yeah.  I mean, it felt like a popsicle that doesn't melt. 
[04:00:30]  It wasn't like a comforting weight.  No.  No.  It was horrible.  Really?  Oh, my God.  Dude, first of all, I'm going to tell you something right now.  I'll tell you why I know Sam's gay.  I'll tell you why I know this kid is a smoocher.  Because he put a fake cock in his mouth, but he covered his teeth like a fucking chick who sucks a real dick.  I'm not going to do it.  That's only somebody who sucked a cock knows to cover your teeth.  I'm not going to do something half-assed. 
[04:01:00]  Yeah, see, and he's sucking in at the end.  So you're a professional cocksucker.  I could be.  I'm not.  I could be.  You covered your teeth, dude.  That looks right, dude.  You think so?  That looks right.  That finally looks natural.  Yeah, you don't look unnatural.  Look at that.  That looks like a guy that knows how to suck cock.  You know how to suck dick, dude.  Travis was born a gay guy.  Let me tell you something.  He used to play games when he was a kid that is just typical gay kid stuff.  Sam, I'm sorry. 
[04:01:30]  I know this is your show.  It is.  But I'm seriously.  I'm not joking.  You and those photographs know how to suck a cock.  And by the way.  That's not your first thing in your mouth that you sucked.  Speaking of who's the gayest in the room.  Yes.  I've never gone to a radio show and flirted with one of the male producers for years at a time.  Bobby Kelly.  Yeah.  Okay.  What show?  This one, dummy.  Who do you flirt with?  That little fucking thing right over there.  All right.  That professional cocksucker over there.  So, so far, I would say there was a reason you were flirting.  All three of you were gayer than me. 
[04:02:00]  I was right on the money.  If I knew you had to suck cock that good, I would have fucking, I would have done it earlier.  Now everything got sexual instead of just romantic.  Now it's just lust.  That photo, honest to God, that's a guy who sucked a dick before.  Yeah, I got news for you, Sam.  I'm going to be flirting with you from now on, too.  Maybe I'm just a natural.  I think we should all try to fuck him.  What is that?  That's Bobby and Sam.  What is that?  Which one?  Which one is that?  You attacked Sam in our old office one time.  Oh, I remember that.  He kneeled down on his neck and was trying to pull his pants off. 
[04:02:30]  You tried to have sex with me.  Was that when I was a retarded dude with the banana on my head?  No, that's not when we were playing Bob Kelly.  Yeah.  That was one of the last days of 57th Street.  That was thin Bob Kelly, too.  Look at those skinny jeans.  He wanted it, too.  Look at you.  I didn't want it at all.  How about happy birthday?  You didn't fight him?  Where's happy birthday?  That's creepy gay kid on YouTube.  Which is you?  That was a character.  Creepy gay kid.  Listen to me.  He sang happy birthday to me.  He tied his shirt in a knot.  No, I was doing a character.  He sang happy birthday. 
[04:03:00]  You're not a police officer.  But you played a character.  I'm with you.  But not on this show.  I'm with you.  This is my only venue.  He's dressed.  He's dressed like a fucking teenage girl that works on a farm.  Yeah.  Yeah, he really does.  You have a record store down in the East Village.  I don't have any record store.  Listen to me.  You know how to suck it down?  You have a Newsy hat on.  Tell me you've never sucked a cock.  I've never sucked a cock.  How did you know how to cover your teeth?  Because who wants teeth?  On a fake. 
[04:03:30]  It's a fake bill, though.  It's fake.  You don't have to really suck the dick.  You can just put it in your mouth like you don't like it.  And number two, he closed his eyes.  Yep.  You closed your eyes.  And like, oh, I don't want this to be reality.  No.  I don't want to see this.  Kind of like, oh, what if this is really Eric's penis?  I'm torn here.  And as much as I want to trash you about this, I got to say, I've never blown anybody.  That you didn't like.  You fucking almost.  I think if I had to blow it, like if somebody was like, dude, listen, you got to blow somebody 
[04:04:00]  and you got to do it good or we're going to blow your brains out or whatever, I think  I would know how to do it.  Of course you would.  Just from seeing it done and having it done so many times, I feel like I would just know  how to do it.  Okay.  Here's the thing, though.  First of all, would you get on your knees and put it in your mouth and show the world  that you know what you're doing?  If it was like, dude, we're going to murder you if you don't do this.  Or if Bailey said, just do it. 
[04:04:30]  If Bailey said, hey, baby girl, get on that.  That's Randy that Joe has a thing for.  We have to take a break because you guys don't take breaks on the main show.  Well, even on the, there's a guy that likes our podcast.  Can't we talk to Marcos?  No.  I'm going to take a break.  Why?  Your podcast is at riotcast.com.  We'll be back.  What's it called?  You know what, dude?  How many millions listen to it, Joe?  Millions.  And millions of things.  Finally.  Finally.  All right.  We'll be back.  Hit this tweet for Eric.  Sam is gay. 
[04:05:00]  The ONA show continues.  Sort of.  This is after ONA Live.  Stay tuned.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is after ONA Live.  Bobby Kelly's hanging out.  Sam Roberts.  I love the fucking shit show.  Yeah?  It's the after show.  I love.  Okay.  Why is that?  Because it's, I think it's a good hang.  Just a hang, right?  I like the fans of the shit show.  Yeah, after show.  We call it after show.  I keep resting that up.  I think it's a, you get good fans. 
[04:05:30]  Speaking of fans, I figure I should reward somebody since nobody got to be on the air today  because Anthony was hosting and he doesn't like talking to the people.  So, me and, during the break, Bob Kelly and myself, earlier today, we're talking about professional wrestling.  You're back on board.  I'm back on.  Because of The Rock, really.  Well, I was back on a few weeks ago.  Well, I'm doing, did you see the movie The Wrestler?  Yes.  Come on.  Of course.  Come on, son.  You know, those little wrestling shows and gymnasium.  Yeah.  I'm going to Raleigh to do one of those tonight. 
[04:06:00]  No shit.  Same name as Bruce Springsteen.  It's in a thousand person venue.  So is the Bruce.  It's not like anyone.  That's what I'm saying.  Bruce, it's not like everybody's going to see Springsteen.  Well, they can listen to it.  People can listen to it at home.  On Sirius.  It's true.  Does anybody know?  If I have Sirius, I can listen to the show tonight.  The show live, yeah.  No shit.  That's cool.  I'll do that.  What channel is Springsteen on?  I wonder if I can hear Jim going.  Do you mind if I take a picture?  I don't know.  I'm looking it up.  No, you'll hear.  So anybody.  Yeah, Tom Hanks going, no, get away from me. 
[04:06:30]  Anybody who's close to Rawway.  That's where it is.  Rawway, New Jersey.  Anybody who's in New York or New Jersey, call up the show right now if you want tickets  to this wrestling show.  Because the Shockmaster, Bob Kelly, you've seen this clip on YouTube, right?  Where he falls down on his face.  Yeah.  The Shockmaster is going to be at the show tonight.  Oh, no shit.  In Rawway.  I'm working at the show with the Shockmaster.  Wow.  The hotline.  Yeah, I know.  That's when he comes to the wall, right?  Yeah.  One of the funniest clips ever.  I'm hoping he does something where he just falls down again.  Fucking gross.  Is nobody screening calls?  Oh, there's a call right there. 
[04:07:00]  Go to Marcos.  So have somebody screen calls.  We have a live show on the air.  What are people doing?  What's Marcos?  Wait, all three lines.  We have it in here.  You can't see it?  Yeah, I can see it.  All three lines have information.  I know, but somebody's been calling the hotline for the whole time, and nobody picks up the phone.  I don't know.  You have a room full of people.  By the way, it's Channel 20 E Street Radio tonight, starting at 6 o'clock.  Boo!  Marcos!  Hey, what's going on?  My man.  What's up, Marcos?  Nothing.  I just wanted to tell Bobby, man, and Joe, I love the podcast, bro. 
[04:07:30]  It's one of my favorite ones right now.  Thank you, buddy.  Does it make you sad when we fight on it?  No, actually, I find it entertaining, man.  I like how you rag on Joe, and I love the whole Joe and Kathy episode.  It was fucking hilarious, bro.  That's going to be on next weekend, right, Eric?  Yep.  Yeah.  Next weekend, they were playing on the channel, right?  Yeah, next Saturday at 11 a.m.  Marcos, what are you doing tonight?  You working?  No, not all today. 
[04:08:00]  So why don't you come out to Rahway and go to a wrestling show?  You want to?  How far is that for me?  I'm not going to fuck you then.  Sam just wants you to come out so you can suck your dick.  Yeah.  I'm not going to do that in front of all those people.  Marcos.  I have to say.  Marcos, I love his response.  How far is that?  It's in Rahway.  It's prowrestlingsyndicate.com.  Hello.  You're on After Open Anthony Live.  All right.  I'm getting out of here.  What's up?  I got to go.  This is getting weird.  There's all these guys coming to a box.  That's the show.  Yeah, but they're getting a...  This looks like a real show coming in.  I got to go. 
[04:08:30]  I got to go to the Apple store.  Yeah, I got to go take a piss.  I got to exchange headphones, you cocksucker.  Me?  Oh, I get it.  Huh?  Why are you mad at him?  No, he's just saying it.  Because remember what we were talking about before the break?  Because he sucks cock.  Yeah, he does.  What's your name?  Dave.  Dave, where are you from?  Woodbridge.  You want to go to this wrestling show?  Sure.  All right.  I'll see you there.  I'm going to put you on hold and give the phone screener your name, okay?  Sounds good.  All right.  Hang on. 
[04:09:00]  People want Springsteen tickets.  I don't have Springsteen tickets.  There's 1,200 people going to this thing.  Don't get mad at me because your fans want what you don't have.  I already gave Dave tickets to the pro wrestling syndicate in Rawway tonight.  You forced it on him.  No, I asked him.  He went, yeah, fuck, I guess.  What the fuck else did he call in for then?  He's not going to go.  No, I guarantee you nobody you give tickets to gets them.  They've already pre-sold like 500 tickets to this thing.  Oh, so 500 people are going to be there.  It's in a rec center.  How many people do you think are showing up?  Fucking Voss sells more tickets.  How many people do you think are going to show up?  It's not in the garden. 
[04:09:30]  1,000, right?  No, not 1,000.  I want to ask Voss if he's coming to Madison.  Are you going to Madison?  No, but go to robertkellylive.com and you'll find out where I'm going.  What about you, Joe?  JoeDarosaComedy.com for the Any Which Way But Loose Southeastern Tour.  Dates start Tuesday.  I loved how mad you...  I've got to just...  Let's see this.  I'm out of here.  Let me see it.  It's unbelievable.  Stupid Rowling gets excited because he got good Springsteen tickets.  This is just turning into a better show. 
[04:10:00]  I've got to go.  The tour kicks off on Tuesday in Asheville, North Carolina.  Yeah, check it out.  We've got to go, man.  We'll see you next time on the show.  You have more time.  This is just rush.  You know why I don't have time?  I've got to go.  Because you idiots don't take breaks and don't leave on time.  Riotcast.com.  That's why I don't have time.  It's your fault.  Don't get mad at me.  It's not my show.  I'm just talent.  Say it.  Would a cock make you feel better?  No, it wouldn't.  And you know that.  It would probably make you...  One specific cock, though, would make you feel better, Joe.  Goddamn. 
[04:10:30]  And I know whose that is.  Sam, I'll see you later.  Bye, buddy.  Thank you for hanging out.  Bye, Roland.  Bye.  You want to go to Raleigh tonight, Bob?  Yeah, I'll go.  Leave tickets at the door for me.  Okay.  Look, Raleigh's going to be a good time.  UCB Fred's probably going to be there.  You're an asshole.  Yeah, really?  Your mic's not on, stupid.  I don't get all the time screaming.  You can get all the Springsteen tickets you want.  You still can't talk on my show.  You're an asshole.  Why don't you go complain to management, kiss-ass?  Oh, I will.  Your name's on target.  Your management's boy now, Roland? 
[04:11:00]  Number one is management.  You love the company, huh?  I love the company.  Company, man.  Are you excited about this Springsteen show?  You know Papa Shongo's going to be at this wrestling show in Raleigh?  I don't care.  You don't care about that?  As long as...  Because Clarence is not going to be at the Springsteen show.  But his nephew is Jay Clements.  Oh, my God.  That's a great replacement.  Tell him everything he knows.  What song are you looking forward to hearing the most?  Incident on 57th Street.  That's your song.  You don't know the lyrics, but that's your song. 
[04:11:30]  That's my song.  Well, listen, Eric, you're not going, are you, to the wrestling show?  You can't...  He's going to smell Joe DeRosa's balls.  Is that what you're doing?  You're going to smell Joe DeRosa's balls?  Yes, that's my new gig.  Eric's got to hang out with his parents tonight, so he can't go to the wrestling show.  Liam's coming in with the guitar.  There's some crazy shit that's happening today.  Stay tuned for Ron and Fez.  If you want to come out and say hello, I'll be in Rawway tonight.  ProWrestlingSyndicate.com for all the directions.  Roland will be at the Springsteen concert. 
[04:12:00]  Wait till you get a dick.  One day, you don't get a dick in the ass.  You're all smiles.  You sell out.  You sell out.  Over under, he falls asleep.  Thank you, sir.  How many shoes do I have?  Shows.  Shows?  A lot.  Exactly.  We're all sell outs.  I'm not a sell out.  I want to do shows.  Yeah, you're like, yes, sir.  I'll do the other show.  I don't get asked to do them.  I ask to do them.  Shut up.  Just get the fuck out of here.  Just wrap up and say good morning.  I'll see you on Monday.  I'll bet him he falls asleep.  Of course he'll fall asleep.  Oh, yeah, big guest on Monday, too.  Who?  Will Ferrell.  Will Ferrell's going to be here on Monday?
