<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a self-aware introduction acknowledging their controversial "shock jock" status.  The broadcast then launched into a discussion about Halloween songs, punctuated by playful insults and listener calls requesting Halloween tunes or discussing the Boston Red Sox's World Series victory. Opie and Anthony recounted their boisterous trip to Boston for the games and a subsequent Halloween party, detailing encounters with other radio personalities.  The conversation segued to Alex Rodriguez's contract opt-out, eliciting strong negative opinions from the hosts.  They also discussed the impending closure of their Chicago show and its replacement with Spanish programming. A listener's experience with AT&T following a house fire was briefly covered, followed by a segment on David Copperfield’s alleged bizarre behavior.  This included a listener’s account of their brother's Britney Spears Halloween costume and  detailed a rape accusation against Copperfield, describing the alleged incident on his “Rape Island” and the ensuing FBI investigation.  Further allegations of Copperfield's unusual methods of selecting women for his shows and obtaining personal information from potential assistants were discussed, along with listener calls corroborating these claims and detailing creepy personal experiences with the magician. The segment concluded with a $1000 call-in contest, punctuated by comedic commentary on an air check of E-Rock, the show's producer.  Rob Bartlett was in studio during this part of the broadcast, contributing to the discussions.  Other news items, including Al Roker's reaction to the n-word and predictions for a Patriots-Colts game, were also touched upon.

The show continued with a humorous discussion about the upcoming Colts vs. Patriots game, using the mascots to predict the winner.  A listener call from Tom in Chicago, expressing dissatisfaction with their current radio station and mentioning Steve Dahl, led to an absurd debate about buffaloes versus jets.  In-studio guests Rob Bartlett and Bob Kelly joined the show. Bartlett shared anecdotes from his time hosting Monday Night Raw, including interactions with Vince McMahon and Yokozuna, which prompted numerous offensive jokes and racial slurs targeting Yokozuna's weight. A clip of Bartlett's crude commentary from a wrestling broadcast was played. The discussion then shifted to a news story about a blind man shooting a home intruder, followed by further tangents.  The hosts promoted Bartlett and Kelly's upcoming appearances. The potentially changing format of their Chicago station to Spanish programming was discussed again.  A highly offensive and graphic call detailing a teacher accused of sexually abusing children culminated in increasingly vulgar and graphic listener reactions.

A segment followed focusing on listener calls detailing their childhood runaway attempts, with stories of short distances covered and reasons for returning home (hunger, fear).  One caller recounted being beaten by his mother, and another described a critical stepfather.  A lengthy, rambling discussion concerning Bob Kelly's childhood trauma involving being thrown down the stairs and his mother's reaction ensued, followed by jokes about his weight loss. A song seemingly mocking Kelly was played, prompting an angry outburst. A caller recounted his parents unexpectedly moving while he was at school.  Another caller detailed being beaten after running away with his brother. Rob Bartlett, again in studio, revealed he had kidney stones in his pocket, prompting a bizarre discussion. The show concluded with the hosts showing Bob Kelly a video of a woman defecating.  Red Rum and other unidentified individuals were also present in the studio. Further plugs for upcoming stand-up comedy shows featuring Bob Kelly and Rob Bartlett were included.

A segment was dedicated to a prolonged, highly vulgar, and sexually explicit discussion around the "Two Girls, One Cup" video. The hosts, along with Bob Kelly, made bets on how long Kelly could watch before becoming nauseated. Music was used in an attempt to help him endure the viewing.  Bob Kelly eventually left the studio, overwhelmed.  The discussion continued, including reactions from others who viewed the video, and various unrelated tangents, including plugs for upcoming comedy shows and further sexually explicit and offensive conversations.

Finally, the show featured a conversation centered on one host's recent wedding, including his unsuccessful attempt to connect with his estranged father.  Details of the small, informal Hawaiian beach wedding were shared, highlighting the lack of traditional elements and comical mishaps with the butterfly release.  Reactions from comedians like Nick DiPaolo, Colin Quinn, Dane Cook, and others from The Cellar who watched the webcast were discussed.  The discussion extended to the hosts’ personal lives, including post-marriage sex lives and general personalities, along with tangents on wedding logistics, traditional wedding customs, and other unrelated topics. The segment concluded with the playing of "The Monster Mash."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Shocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their options.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial Radio Personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Shocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Shocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Shocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Shocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Shocks, Opie and Anthony.  If you want to put it, feel free.  I've done it before.  I'll let you go from to my and that's really sick.  This is where entertainment is going.  More audio V-Rock in the bathroom.  They are sick. 
[00:01:00]  Can you pop this?  I want to see something squirt out.  Aim it over there.  This is the worst.  Go on.  The worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Ah, good morning.  Good Monday morning to y'all.  Let's do this the proper way.  How?  Before we start the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes.  It's rolling.  Singing.  The Star Spangled Banner.  Okay.  Okay.  Jose, can you see me by the stout early lights? 
[00:02:00]  For the ramparts we watch, with some gallantly gleaming.  And the rocket's red glare, God's words bursting in air, gave proof to the light, that our flag was still there.  Who's a disaster-spangled banner yet wave? 
[00:02:30]  For the land of the free, and the home of the brave.  And now we're ready to broadcast the Opie and Anthony show.  Got to clear the tear out of my eye.  That's right.  You know, there's some renditions of that song that just gets you. 
[00:03:00]  We got to have Roland sing some Halloween songs before Halloween.  A couple days left here, so.  Oh, yeah.  He's not taking my Monster Mash.  Do we have Monster Mash today?  We'll play that a little later on this morning.  Yeah.  I hope so did Kenny do a Monster Mash.  We'll do, uh, Roland do a Monster Mash or, or, or Monster Mash.  Or that other Halloween song.  Monster Mash.  Monster Mash.  How many Halloween songs are there?  Three? 
[00:03:30]  Halloween, the Halloween Shuffle?  The Halloween, what?  There is not the Halloween Shuffle.  Halloween Shuffle, what?  Here, list all the Halloween songs for us, E-Rock.  Werewolves in London?  That's a stretch.  That's probably what a classic rock station would do on Halloween.  We're going to be playing your Halloween rock song today.  Yeah, people.  Here's, uh, Werewolves in London, Ward Zeman, on your classic rock station, The Beaver.  Oh, the, uh, Thriller?  Yeah, that would probably be like a Halloween song, but it wasn't made as a Halloween song. 
[00:04:00]  No.  Are there any vampire songs or mummy songs?  It's pretty much Monster Mash.  It's just Monster Mash.  It's pretty, that's it.  That's all that stupid holiday, uh, not even a holiday.  After Monster Mash, all those artists out there were like, ah, that's good enough for Halloween.  Screw it.  One, one-eyed, one-horned, flying purple people eater.  Yeah, we'll throw that in the category.  I don't know.  What about Spooky? 
[00:04:30]  Ooh.  Spooky something.  Spooky.  Spooky?  The song Spooky?  I don't know.  Isn't there something with Spooky in it that could be a Halloween song?  Ooh.  Spooky Scary.  That's right.  You're a wolf from Mitzka.  Spooky Scary.  Horses becoming men.  Men becoming wolves.  And that's all it is.  That's what drives me nuts, that 30 Rock.  They should have had a full-length freaking video of that, man. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, absolutely.  But knowing like Tracy, you can't keep them focused enough to do more than 15 seconds at  a time, unfortunately.  You know, you'd start going off on something else.  But you know what?  That 15 seconds is always hilarious.  Hilarious.  That's hilarious, you guys say it.  That's hilarious.  Oh, Rocky Horror.  Sure.  We'll add that to our Halloween music list.  Hey, it's Bruce in Louisiana.  Bruce?  Man, that role in is damn hilarious.  How does he end every song like it's a question? 
[00:05:30]  I don't know.  I don't know, because he looks around.  It's the whole thing.  He looks around trying to get approval from people, and he's not sure.  Yeah.  So he's, eh?  Eh?  Well, you know what?  Before the end of this break, let's do Ave Maria.  That's my favorite role in song.  Because you talk about a question, and he goes, Maria?  Maria?  Maria?  Ave Maria?  How about Chris on Long Island?  Chris, what's up?  I put a spell on you.  I put a spell on you. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, yeah.  What are we doing?  A Howie Carr bit?  Who gives a crap?  What's your favorite Halloween songs?  I'm going to be paying millions and millions of dollars to do hacky bits.  What's your favorite Halloween song of all time?  Come on, everybody.  Be calling.  I actually, Howie Carr is a, believe it or not, he really is a talk show hack.  Mm-hmm.  But the older people in Boston love the guy for some reason.  And I was driving to Cape Cod once, and he actually asked people for an hour what their, 
[00:06:30]  we bring this up a lot, but their favorite ice cream flavor.  Yeah.  How many are there, and who cares?  Call after call, tell us your favorite ice cream flavor.  Once you get through vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry, kind of a drop-off.  And then they got outrageous, because then when they were running out of flavors, they're like,  well, how about a topic?  What's your favorite topic for ice cream?  And then you get someone silly going, I like mayo on my ice cream.  And Howie's like, well, that's outrageous.  Thanks for calling it, E-Rock. 
[00:07:00]  I saw you looking at him.  I was going to, I beat you to the punch.  I know.  I was just thinking of him looking at the phone screen.  I was saying E-Nagel.  Ray Parker Jr., yes, Ghostbusters.  All right, we got to find him.  Oh, Ghostbusters.  Ghostbusters.  Let's go to Steve on Long Island.  Steve?  It's a 6am.  Hello.  Yeah?  You're playing Roland singing.  I hope he dies of AIDS.  It's too early for Roland singing? 
[00:07:30]  He dies of AIDS.  You guys are killing me, and somebody needs to give him AIDS.  It's a patriotic song.  Yeah, we're going to start every show with that, unless you approve.  Robert, California, what's up?  Hey, you got Dead Man's Party from Wingo Boingo.  Well, we'll add that to our Halloween music list.  That one?  Dead Man's Party, or something like that.  All right, thank you, sir.  Let's go to Neil in Buffalo, listening on the edge, the home of Shred and Reagan.  What's up, Neil?  Hey, boys. 
[00:08:00]  Hey.  Witchy Woman.  Oh, if we start going into songs like Witchy Woman.  Well, that's what the classic rock stations do.  Yeah.  Not the classic rock that really rocks radio stations, just your run-of-the-mill classic  rock station.  Hacky.  We'll do their Halloween special.  Classic rock.  Oh, DOA has to be on that list.  Yeah.  On that list.  By Blood, by Help Me Out.  This is obscure.  BAB used to play it.  The home of rock and roll used to play it every Halloween.  That home of rock and roll.  DOA. 
[00:08:30]  Help Me Out.  I can't.  What?  Yeah, Blood Rock.  DOA.  A one-hit wonder.  But the song gets played every Halloween.  All right.  Let's play this and get it over with.  He and the Rockies are down to their last strike.  Game over.  Series over.  And the Red Sox are world champs again.  And so the Boston Red Sox, as they did in 2004, celebrate a world championship on the 
[00:09:00]  road.  One, two, three, four.  Dancing, I said, my gravy shot it.  We're not here, I'm not so loud.  Boston, you know we love you, that they're about to the sound.  Oh, don't blame us if we ever doubt you.  You know we couldn't live without you. 
[00:09:30]  Stop testing it.  You are the only, only, only, only.  The Rudy showed up at the grounds.  And there you have it.  The Red Sox win the World Series.  Is that their song, the team song?  Yeah, I don't like the team song, Tessie, whatsoever.  But yes, that's their song.  What happened to Dirty Water?  Love that dirty water.  I hate that song, too.  You don't like Dirty Water, really?  No, I hate it.  I love the original, and I love every cover ever made of Dirty Water. 
[00:10:00]  Something about that song.  You know Dirty Water.  Womp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp,  Standells, I think, right?  Couldn't tell you.  You really don't know?  No, I really, if that song comes on, I cannot get it off.  You don't like this song, really?  No.  Why?  It just, I don't like the song itself, because it's like, listen to them.  I'm going to tell you about my...  Shut up, who cares?  I've never heard this. 
[00:10:30]  You've heard this?  Come on, Jim.  Really?  What's that?  This is a huge hit.  Down by the river.  Down by the river.  This is a 60s?  Yeah.  Sounds like something you'd see, like, in a Vietnam, like a montage of a Vietnam, during  a Vietnam movie.  You really never heard this song?  Not to my knowledge, no.  Along with lovers and brothers and thieves, I'll be there. 
[00:11:00]  This is going to go on the hook.  Don't worry.  Well, I love that dirty water.  Oh, Boston, you're my home.  There you go.  Let's say hi to Brian in Boston.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, if the curse is broken, go Sox go, baby.  Go Sox go.  And a lot of people are like, well, that means you didn't really want the Sox to win the  World Series.  I'm telling you, when it comes to American League teams, that's the only team I want  to see win.  I don't like the Yankees.  That's sacrilege. 
[00:11:30]  I'm a Mets fan, so you can't vote.  You can't root for the freaking Yankees after the Mets are knocked out.  You just can't.  Give me another American League team I should be rooting for.  Nobody.  They all stink.  Kansas City with Oils all the way next year.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, they still play Dirty Water after every win.  They play Dirty Water after every home win.  Yeah, when do they play the Tessie thing, though?  I don't know when they're losing, because that's their rally cry.  They want the fans to rally behind a bunch of bums, but... 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, I don't get the Tessie thing whatsoever.  I don't get that.  I like the Dirty Water.  All right.  I'll get on it.  Thank you.  All right.  Puss it out.  Yeah, there you go.  Red side.  Thank you.  We were up there.  I don't even know when we were up there.  It was a blur, man.  We went up Friday after the radio show to Boston, and man, that town was into the socks, obviously.  You pointed out that every storefront had Go Socks.  It was just, you couldn't get away from it. 
[00:12:30]  It was just...  Go Socks.  Let's Go Socks.  Printed out things.  Signs all over the place.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We stayed at a hotel right next to Fenway, and as you're waiting for the elevators, you  could actually see Fenway.  Yeah.  And it was kind of creepy, because knowing that they were in Colorado for the game, and  it was a rainy, crappy morning, and there's Fenway just completely empty.  Yeah.  And you're like, that team is in the World Series.  In the World Series, and their house is empty.  And their house is empty, right.  Thank God.  Because the last thing I would have wanted to do was to have been up there during the 
[00:13:00]  World Series and having them home.  Yeah.  Because we wouldn't have had a hotel room.  No, we wouldn't.  And if we did get one, it just would have been a mob scene.  I would have loved to have been up there for the Red Sox winning it all.  Yeah.  And I want to thank Toucher and Rich and the rest of BCN for being very nice to us up there.  Had a good time, definitely.  Wow, that Toucher could drink, huh?  Wow.  Wow-wee.  You got some stiff competition, my friend. 
[00:13:30]  Wow.  You got some competition.  Those guys look like Alkies.  I've done their show a couple times.  They definitely look like, yeah, they certainly like Alkies, both of them.  I don't even know if Toucher knew where he was at the Halloween party at the Hard Rock.  Well, yeah.  On Friday night.  The beers were flowing.  Wow.  Oof.  So then we did the Halloween party, and then we were back on a train Saturday morning.  It was the weirdest thing ever.  Yeah, it was just one of those get in, get out, put on a show and leave. 
[00:14:00]  Right.  And yeah, got back Saturday and then just kept going.  Did you really?  Kept partying, yeah.  I made a huge mistake on Saturday, too.  What'd you do?  Well, I had my car here in the city from last week, and then my girlfriend had her car.  So I was like, all right, just, you know, you go.  I'm going to stop off at the Apple store.  I wanted to pick up a couple of things. 
[00:14:30]  I get to the Apple store.  There is a line around the block to get into the place.  Why?  For the new operating?  For the new operating system, Leopard.  But wait a minute.  Why would there be a line to get, it's open 24 hours.  Yes.  They don't have enough Apple stores.  Exactly.  Oh, you couldn't get in for anything?  Couldn't get in.  Because I leaned over.  I was like, hey, dude, I'm just looking for some graphics stuff.  I need, you got to go to the end of the line, dude.  My friend, I'm so sorry, but this is the Apple store, and I hate to turn you away because 
[00:15:00]  it's so, like, unfriendly, but you have to go online.  And then I'm just standing there all like, brr.  I wasn't going down there for that, but there are so many people down there, I guess, the  fire code to have a certain amount of people.  So you got to wait for a bunch of people to come out before they sent a bunch of people  in, and a lot of people weren't coming out, so.  How long was the wait?  I didn't wait.  I went home, click, click, click on the keyboard, and ordered stuff I needed online. 
[00:15:30]  Screw it.  The Apple store here in New York, there's one downtown, but the 24-hour one is on 59th  Street.  It's in a perfect location, and Fifth Avenue.  And when you walk up to it, people haven't seen it, it's a big glass cube.  Yeah.  And you walk in, and the store is actually in a basement.  It's downstairs.  Well, you should explain, the big glass cube is the size of, like, a large elevator.  Oh, yeah.  That's it.  That's the Apple store, what you see on the street.  Right, on the outside.  Right, that's what's so cool about it, and then, go ahead, sorry.  How many feet would you say wide it is? 
[00:16:00]  I'm not good at judging.  The glass apple thing itself?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just a piece of glass.  It's really high.  It's, I don't know, I would put it at about 15, 20 feet wide.  20 by 20 by 20 by 20, something like that?  With a big cube, with a big white apple hanging in there.  Yep.  And that's all you see from the street, and then you go downstairs, and it's just massive.  Oh, it was cool.  You go down the spiral staircase that's made of glass that some poor schlep has to keep  mopping.  Yeah.  His whole job is to sit there with a Swiffer mop and just clean up the dampness so no one 
[00:16:30]  slips and owns Apple.  It smells like electronics in there, though.  It just smells really good.  It's the best smelling store in the country.  And there's people just on computers all the time, and just, it's just, ugh.  The last time I was in there.  I'm trying to buy something.  The last time I was in there, I was buying something, and the workers were distracted,  and I'm like, what the hell's going on?  And they finally let me in on the whole thing, that there was a guy jacking at a laptop.  He was jacking. 
[00:17:00]  Wow.  You know, it's a wide open store.  There really isn't a nook or cranny to get your jack on.  And then there was a whole scene as they were kicking the guy out of the Apple store.  Did they arrest him?  No, they just kind of kicked him out.  I think he was kind of like a little off.  Was he in the little pillow kid section?  Maybe that was a problem, too.  He was close to homeless.  I wouldn't call him officially homeless, but he was well on his way.  That's a great place to go if you're homeless. 
[00:17:30]  You just want to look at a little porn?  Yeah, and you don't even try to do it discreetly on one of the smaller models.  No, yeah.  You just grab the biggest one with a 30-inch monitor and just put hardcore porno on it.  A big G5, you get like 15 a terabyte of hard drive.  Open up six windows, just smut.  So your mistake was going to the Apple store or was that a bigger mistake?  No, I went to the Apple store and then...  Usually when you say there was a mistake over the weekend, it was I went gambling. 
[00:18:00]  No, no.  I decided to drive 150 miles an hour.  Yeah.  I decided to shoot something in my basement.  I mean, we're kind of breathing a sigh of relief that your mistake this time around was that  you didn't want to wait online at the Apple store.  Those aren't mistakes.  Those are just things I do in life.  A mistake was me.  I should have known that the new operating system was out and it was going to take forever.  Jimmy, do you want to partake in the new OS?  No, I actually almost did.  I was going to go at night after the cellar because you can go 24 hours. 
[00:18:30]  You go three or four.  There's people in it, but I mean...  Amazingly enough, I know there's still people hanging out in there.  I ordered the operating system for five computers.  I got the five computer one and I'm just going to put it on my PowerBook at first and see how  it runs because I barely use that for anything and see if it's all right.  The test run at first and you may see a PowerBook go into it.  I'm going to do a shredder if it doesn't work because I get very angry with operating 
[00:19:00]  systems that don't work.  All right.  Listen, moving on.  I want to spend literally one minute on this.  A-Rod, that bum!  Minutes too long.  All right, good.  I just looked at the clock.  I'm glad you didn't agree with it.  I see how that second hand's going around.  For the rest of America, A-Rod has opted out of a...  How much?  I'm going to say $250 million contract this morning.  Where was it?  Which I'm happy.  Good.  I want him gone.  Yeah.  Bye-bye.  Great regular season player. 
[00:19:30]  That bum has never won anything.  I would love him to leave.  Goodbye.  Bye-bye.  Supposedly it's not completely over.  Please let him go.  A little maneuvering on everyone's part and then the Yankees might go back to him now  that he's a free agent.  I guess he's officially a free agent.  Let him go.  I guess they're going to see what he gets on the open market and then they might...  He's a disloyal...  They might come back into the negotiation.  He's a disloyal pig.  He really is.  He's a disloyal slob.  Yeah.  Well, that's why he doesn't have a ring.  Just go.  Yeah, but most... 
[00:20:00]  Good for him.  Most athletes today are disloyal.  Yeah, and a lot of teams are too.  I mean, they really are.  But I would still like to see him go.  I hate him.  But he takes the cake, right, Jimmy?  He certainly does.  He takes the cake.  He's just a douche.  I'd like him if he won things.  How about this?  I'll give you A-Rod for David Ortiz.  How about that?  That would be nice.  Give me that savage left-hand swing.  I'll take that in the World Series or in the ninth inning over that stupid ass who hits  a lot of June homers.  Yeah.  August 9th, another homer. 
[00:20:30]  He could slam that ball in June, July.  Oh.  How was Mr. October?  Then the clinch comes.  Huh?  How was Mr. October this year?  Oh, Mr. October.  He sucks.  I hate him.  I want that stupid, big-toothed Alfonso Soriano back.  His awful teeth that Kevin Dillon bashed in in platoon.  That's how Soriano laughs, man.  He had those big, giant choppers, that stupid face.  There you go. 
[00:21:00]  He's a problem in the clubhouse.  I love him.  Hey, really fast.  The reporters here in New York, they're reporting on the A-Rod story from a very, very dark and  empty Yankee stadium.  Why do they have to go all the way up there just to say that A-Rod is now officially a  free agent?  We're here in front of Yankee Stadium where no one will be for months and months.  There's like a homeless guy sleeping in the background.  That's about all.  I don't understand why they bother.  The freaking reporters do that. 
[00:21:30]  Let's say hi to Jennifer in Jersey.  Jennifer.  Hey.  Hey.  How are you guys doing?  Great.  Anthony hates your name if you haven't figured that out yet.  Can I change your name, please?  I'm really upset because you guys don't know why it's here this morning.  You're just noticing?  Yeah.  Well, I was out of work for like three days, so I'm probably missing something.  Yeah.  So are we.  A job in Philly. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  We're a bit sad.  I think if like the Pest could rally something, we would go down there and at least say, hey,  thanks.  Thanks for the memories.  We should go down there and at least throw a thanks a lot party.  But yeah, we're currently searching for a new home in Philly there, Jennifer.  Jennifer.  Okay.  Well, they can get rid of Preston and Steve and put you on 93.  Oh, yeah.  Well, of course they're going to do that.  Yeah.  That's what I would do if I was running a radio station. 
[00:22:30]  I didn't know the eye test was today.  All right.  Sure.  Is the station eye test today?  What's that?  I don't know.  E-Rock picked the smallest possible print for writing down stuff on his little monitor  that we all have to look at.  Well, there you go.  Thank you.  Hey, by the way, we're going to do E-Rock's air check.  Maybe we could do that after the break.  E-Rock-tober wrapping up.  I know I'm sad about it.  Me too.  But E-Rock-tober only gives way to Povember. 
[00:23:00]  Povember.  Which I'm very excited about Povember.  We've got to do a better job of introducing Master Poe to a lot of the listeners.  Well, that's why we're going to spend the whole month of November doing that.  So we've got to break out some of the old Poe clips.  Povember.  Povember.  So I hope the guys are on it.  Poe's greatest hits of Stupidity, please.  He's greatest hits of Stupidity.  Jesus.  Oh, he could kill you with a pen, but, you know, he's...  Not writing with it, he can't.  No, no, no.  I think you would have the advantage if it was a writing contest. 
[00:23:30]  Poe's the security guy at XM who greets everybody when they come in.  Hello.  And he's a good spirit and a good soul.  Gentleman.  But frustrating as hell on the air.  But I'll say this.  I hope he's not listening.  The man is a boob.  Oof.  All right.  Hey, we're going to take a quick break.  We got lots to do today.  So there you go.  The Sox win the World Series.  Bravo.  Yay.  Bravo.  Congrats.  We're going to talk about Copperfield next.  This story's got some legs. 
[00:24:00]  This David Copperfield.  Oh, I love it.  We'll get into that.  It's hilarious.  What a ghoul this guy is.  Just a ghoul.  Yeah, absolutely.  And the more money you have as a ghoul, the bigger ghoul you can be.  Yeah.  Jesus.  And for the people that don't know the sound you're waiting to hear today to try to win  $1,000 between 7 and 7.30, we'll give you that sound after the break.  We're going to make you wait a little bit, okay?  Run.  And also E-Rock's air check all on the way.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Broadcast program. 
[00:24:30]  Saturday Night Virus.  Coming this weekend to the Saturday Night Virus, Kevin Smith does nothing.  We just play shit he already did.  So tune in this Saturday from 9 to midnight to hear three of Kevin Smith's modcasts.  That's happening this Saturday at 9 p.m. Eastern on XM202 The Virus.  Chewbacca! 
[00:25:00]  I love this riff.  Here, check it out.  The Opie and Anthony show.  I don't think Boston's awake yet.  What time did the game end last night?  Anyone know?  Had to be like 1 in the morning, right?  What time did it end?  What is it?  It's at 10.  Couldn't have been that.  Oh, no.  Had to be.  Stocks win the World Series.  You know that by now. 
[00:25:30]  Well, it wasn't one of those ridiculous scoring games, so it might not have been that long.  4-3, though.  Sometimes those games take a lot longer because it's, you know, a lot of strategy going on.  Phone number 877-212-ONDA.  We got another chance for you to win $1,000.  This is what you're listening for today between 7 and 7.30.  Yeah, when you hear that between 7 and 7.30, if you're the 10th caller, you will win today's $1,000. 
[00:26:00]  Phone number 877-212-ONDA.  All right.  Well, I guess the fires are pretty much under control out there in California.  A few are still burning, but.  The winds died down.  The Santa Ana winds.  And, yeah.  The fire department.  All of the fire department.  Like, a thousand fire departments.  And those planes. 
[00:26:30]  That's something you never see around here.  Those big dudes.  Just dropping a crap load of water.  But they're like 747s or something like that.  I know.  It's not even like these little planes anymore.  And then they got the helicopters and the little planes.  Yeah.  And these giant jets that have been transformed into water carriers.  The belly just opens up.  Yeah.  Just a massive amount of water.  A bunch of water drops out.  Rumor has it they found a scuba diver in the middle of the forest now that the fire has been put out.  Well, he wasn't even burnt, and he was in full scuba gear in a burnt-out forest. 
[00:27:00]  I'm amazed how they found that guy.  Oh, the guy that got dragged out of the plane?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're starting to think that maybe they scooped him up when they were getting some water to put out the fire.  Yeah, to put out the fire.  And he was dropped from above with the water.  And that's why they found him without a burn on his body in full scuba diver gear.  You wonder how he didn't have a burn, though, if they dropped him onto a fire.  It's amazing how that happened. 
[00:27:30]  It's not like they dropped him on the polar ice caps.  They dropped him onto a forest fire.  Right.  And yet there was not a burn in his body because apparently the little trickles of water falling out with him extinguished the fire and sort of his wet scuba body.  Yeah, that old gag.  I love that one.  But it's amazing there's not a lot of live frogs in forest fire wreckage.  Yeah.  And fish.  You don't see a lot of fish swimming in those puddles.  Oh, no.  Old scuba guy.  God bless him. 
[00:28:00]  Matty from Greensboro helping us out.  Game ended a little after midnight.  That's a quick little baseball game right there.  Right around four hours by the time they did the first pitch.  Not too shabby.  Not too shabby at all.  Congratulations, Boston.  Yes, of course.  So you go back to the fires and now you got the reporters, you know, just kind of showing people going through their soot, trying to find stuff, their wreckage.  And I saw like where this lady was just devastated.  And then like a neighbor found like a photo album and gave it to her and she started crying. 
[00:28:30]  Pet story.  Because it's...  That happens all the time.  Because it survived the fire.  Survived.  The photo album survived the fire.  How do you not take the stupid photo album?  The fires.  The fires were like, all right, the fires will be here in two weeks.  I mean, it's very sad, but everybody knew the fire was coming.  Grab the photo album.  Grab your valuables.  Well, I wonder how that worked.  Like were people just calling U-Haul companies going, oh my God, get over here immediately.  This fire is on its way.  Or at least, you know, load up your trunk with your pictures and things that are irreplaceable. 
[00:29:00]  Or put it on disc.  Yeah, how about that?  It's 2007.  Hello.  By the way, Matty S.  Did I say hello?  I hate that hello.  It's on crack.  Matty S is absolutely wrong.  He's in Greensboro, North Carolina.  The game ended for him a little after midnight because I'm sure he just couldn't give an S.  A real Boston fan's checking in.  The game actually ended at 1245.  Ah, yeah.  That seems a little more like it.  The game ended for me a couple of weeks ago. 
[00:29:30]  Yes.  Poor Yankees.  It ended for me in 2005.  It's true.  Like a blown off, I'm just a boy.  I just wanted.  You just wanted a little autograph.  I'm just a boy.  And got nothing.  All right.  Hey.  And this next story is in.  Yeah, that's where.  Jaws tight.  Yeah, it was a little segue into this very interesting story.  So one of the people that lost their homes had to call AT&T.  Uh-huh.  And this is what happened.  Listen to this.  You had to take a call today that was rather interesting, to say the least. 
[00:30:00]  You spoke with people at AT&T because you were wondering about your cable bill, essentially,  and your phone bill.  And if you can, as succinctly as you can, tell me what happened.  And I called there to let them know that our house was destroyed to cancel all this stuff.  And the first thing they asked me was if I had a chance to grab the receiver for the satellite dish.  And I told them no.  That's the last thing that was on my mind.  So then they told me that I would have to pay the $300 for the receiver. 
[00:30:30]  I went ahead and tried to argue it.  I asked to speak to the supervisor.  And she pretty much told me that we will be receiving the bill for the $300 for the receiver that they lost.  Oh, they're going to send the shame, shame, shame team out on them, I bet you.  AT&T, I guess it's good that they're concentrating on that stuff instead of fixing the reception here in New York.  It's good.  Collecting their $300 from burnt receivers.  They are an atrocious company.  All over the place.  What was your reaction to this? 
[00:31:00]  I'm angry.  I don't think that's right at all.  I don't understand how they can do that to people I asked to have the bill postponed until we got reimbursed through our insurance.  And she said, sorry, you have to pay it as soon as you get your bill in the mail like any other normal bill.  And you clearly identified yourself as a San Diego fire picker.  Yes, I did.  I told her that our house was destroyed and things like that.  I'm not just calling to get out of it.  Okay, well, that's actually kind of disturbing.  Kind of. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, kind of.  Well, let me get back to the Red Sox thing.  Bill from Waterford, who I can trust.  This guy is a faithful listener.  He writes, Opie, first pitch was at 830.  The game ended at around 1205.  The Boston guy who told you 1245 is still drunk.  So now it's back to the game ended right around midnight a little after.  Three and a half hours of game or something.  That is a distinct possibility.  We did also hear that there were 35 arrests.  30, yeah.  Or thereabouts in Boston.  All around Fenway. 
[00:32:00]  They just love getting a little raucous after the game.  And the game wasn't even there.  They were under control, considering.  Were they?  Yes.  When Detroit wins it, forget it.  Well, that's Detroit.  There's a curfew for everybody.  That's Detroit.  Where was it?  The Cardinals never won the World Series, did they?  I'm sure they have.  Or did they win the pennant?  What happened where it was the lamest celebration ever because they're just all like, they're 
[00:32:30]  all just white bread family people.  And they were just.  Hooray.  What was it, Travis?  You know the story?  That was last year.  Huh?  That was last year at the Cardinals won.  Oh, they did?  Yeah.  White people hanging toilet paper under the arch.  Bunch of corn balls.  Yeah.  And they were.  They were all just like, yay.  Yeah.  Like the lamest celebration ever.  It says the celebration appeared milder than three years ago when the Sox ended their long 
[00:33:00]  championship drought, but as the revelry continued into the morning, fans overturned cars and  set small fires.  Some were wrestled to the ground by police who said they had made at least 37 arrests, mainly  in the Fenway area by 2 a.m.  37 arrests wouldn't be that much if it was people leaving Fenway, but the game was, you  know, 2,000 miles away or so, and they're just getting raucous in the bars, coming out. 
[00:33:30]  Of course, you have to.  Get arrested?  Yes, you have to get arrested for your team.  It's got to go old school.  That's ridiculous, man.  I saw the video of the Yankees winning it in 1977.  Yeah.  Oh, you want to talk about a celebration, man.  Yeah, they kind of stopped that whole thing.  Unfortunately, they took that away from us, the fans.  The cops come right in on horseback and just, like, stop everything.  Yeah.  There's a police presence all over the place. 
[00:34:00]  Something about seeing a policeman on a horse stops you from, you know, running onto the  field to get your share of the field.  You are absolutely not going to win that foot race, that foot-hoof race.  We should get some, like, some stats from 1977, because I saw it recently, and I'm like,  wow.  And I remember reading or seeing that people were actually carrying their own seat out  of the stadium and everything.  Oh, yeah.  They just felt they could take whatever they wanted.  That's great. 
[00:34:30]  I'm just going to rip this out of the ground and take it with me, and there's no one there  to stop me.  No.  Could you imagine trying to leave with a seat now?  You know, it's worth mentioning again.  I like to bring this up, but the Bills win the AFC title back in the day when I was doing  radio up there, and you talk about how they've taken this away from the fans.  Yeah.  Like, all of a sudden, the Bills fans jump on the goalpost.  They were like, I don't know, a dozen, like, guys that were insane enough to figure out how  to, like, climb up the pole. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, that was the big thing.  And get up on the goalpost, and then the rest of the people are shaking it.  This thing, I wish there was a video of this on YouTube.  It's one of the most amazing things I've ever seen in my life at a sporting event, and I  have not been able to find a video since.  We're just looking at some old Yankee footage there.  This is the 1977 clip that you can see on YouTube.  The field is covered with people.  Yeah, people were ripping up the grass.  They were filling up little, like, beer bottles with the dirt. 
[00:35:30]  They were carrying their own seats out of the stadium.  People probably still have that dirt.  It's all hardened.  And they're still showing people the bottle, and people are like, shut up.  Who cares?  I was at that.  No one cares.  You're an alcoholic, and there's roaches in your apartment.  Why don't you feed your wife?  Now, if you had, like, a mummified Billy Martin head.  Exactly.  This is a windshield with a skull mark in it.  Now, that is a piece of trivia I would like.  Look, this is a plane with a Canton, Ohio destination, and there's a mustache in the steering wheel. 
[00:36:00]  You want the steering wheel with the mustache in it?  The mustache.  Certainly do.  Wow, wow.  That's great.  Here's a burnt-out husk with a catcher's mitt still inside of it.  Would you like that?  Jesus.  There you go.  That would be some memorabilia.  Well, that would be something to show your friends.  Hey, come down to my basement.  I've got to show you something. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, young George.  Wow.  But anyway, so really fast.  So then they're on the goalpost, they're shaking it, and they're able to completely knock it down.  Yep.  Completely knock it down while the rest of the field is packed with people.  This is way before YouTube, so it's hard to see this video.  I need to see this again.  And then the Bills fans got the bright idea they needed to get the goalpost out of the stadium.  And I know the faithful listeners have heard this story, but I love telling this story.  And you can't just take it out the old-fashioned way and, like, just walk out of the stadium with it. 
[00:37:00]  Through the, yeah, exit.  So as a group, I guess they've realized if they carry the goalpost to the top of the stadium, they can throw it over the side.  It just becomes this savage bunch of ants.  So, yeah, it's a bunch of ants.  They carry it all the way to the top of the stadium.  And I watched this thing go over the top, over the top.  And I'm sure they made sure to look out below to make sure nobody was walking around there that could become impaled on a goalpost. 
[00:37:30]  I need to find this video again.  And then we went back to the, you know, some tailgating.  We're just hanging out, throwing the football around, do a little barbecue, a few more beers.  And we finally, like, leave, right?  And we watched the – I don't know how many guys were left on this thing, but maybe, like, three or four guys on a piece of the goalpost that easily was 10 to 12 feet long,  just walking down the road that leads to the highway.  And it was pretty much the last guy that has it gets it.  And to this day, I've heard that in all the local bars in the area, they have pieces of the goalposts from that memorable year. 
[00:38:00]  That's something you just don't see anymore.  No, you just – so, I mean –  That would be so arrested in a second.  But so, 38 people arrested outside Fenway.  Ah.  The old days, it was crazy.  Remember – what's his name on the horse backwards with champagne?  Wade Boggs.  Wade Boggs.  Thank you.  Yeah, there you go.  Well, that was at Yankee Stadium, right?  And he was a Yankee.  Yeah.  I mean, he was on the field.  Yeah. 
[00:38:30]  How about a great piece of memorabilia?  I actually saw a DiMaggio World Series ring from the late 40s.  The World Series ring still had a piece of Marilyn Monroe's cheek skin in it.  When she got a little lippy.  Absolutely.  The whole world may think you're fantastic, but as far as I'm concerned, you're fat asses in front of the TV.  That's why they called him old Jolting Joe.  So, she sure was jolted when she mouthed off.  Hey, could – Iraq, I know I'm going to change gears here, but could you go to Brother Elmo's MySpace page? 
[00:39:00]  I'm hearing rumors.  My sister called me yesterday.  I want to turn a lot of people on to what an insane person my brother is.  I'm not sure if it's up there yet.  Give me one second here.  You know, it's Halloween and everyone's figuring out –  Oh, by the way, like Ant and I, we were in Boston for a Halloween party.  If you're thinking as going as one of the Rutgers girls, do not do it.  Everyone is doing that costume this year. 
[00:39:30]  That's a big one.  And if you're thinking of doing Britney Spears, do not do it.  Everyone's doing Britney Spears as well, including my brother Elmo.  All right.  That's weird.  That's my brother Elmo.  Go to Brother Elmo on MySpace to see what he dressed up as this past weekend.  And please, Stephen S. from Bayshore, if you're listening, put this on the show rundown on onaradio.com later on today.  Put the picture up of my brother.  He decided to dress as Britney Spears at the VMAs.  The guys that dress like girls on Halloween, there's something going on there. 
[00:40:00]  Don't call my brother a fruit.  That's all I'll say.  Don't call my brother a fruit.  I would never.  Don't call him a fruit.  I love Elmo.  He's straight, but maybe he just wanted to feel pretty.  But there's something going on there.  I don't know what it is.  I'm not going to make any accusations.  Right.  I'm just saying it's that one day a year where, as a man, you are completely free to dress  as a woman, and you choose to.  Yeah. 
[00:40:30]  I mean, a little weird.  Hey, can you go to the-  Do you ever dress like a chick?  No.  How about you just go to the picture of your head?  I don't need other pictures.  You guys have bang for.  E-Rock's just surfing on his own, and now we lost the picture.  Just keep it on the picture so we can describe it.  What do you do, Eric?  E-Rock's trying to figure out how to buy a couch or something.  My brother dressed as the chubby Britney Spears, and it's up on his MySpace.  That's what he did for Halloween this past weekend. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, there were girls at the BCM party that were dressed as various phases of Britney.  They had, like, the Britney when she was the innocent Britney, and then they had the crazy  Britney, slutty Britney, pregnant Britney, things like that, all walking around in a  little group.  That's all.  That's all I'm trying to say.  All right.  I guess there's nothing more there.  Go to Brother Elmo on MySpace if you want to see my brother dressed as a fruit. 
[00:41:30]  Tim in Cleveland, what's up?  Yeah, I had a story for you guys about what happened to the stadiums when the fans go nuts.  Yeah.  It was back in 95 when Cleveland had their last game at the old stadium, the old Cleveland  Browns Stadium.  I was, like, fucking, oops, sorry.  I was, like, 12 years old.  And after the game was over, we were playing the Cincinnati Bengals, and we got our asses.  God, I don't remember if we lost or not, but the fans just went nuts. 
[00:42:00]  They started tearing the rows out like you were talking about, and in the dog pound, the  dudes were tearing up the old bleachers and chucking them on the field.  They were actually, they were, like, a couple years ago at the new stadium, they were throwing  bottles at the actual players.  Just back in the day, man, we were throwing stadium chairs, we were throwing bleachers  at them.  They tore up whole rows and chucked them out there.  It was frickin' awesome.  Yeah.  Like I said, I was only 12 years old, so I just got to sit back and watch. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, I miss that stuff.  When your team won, I loved when you would just go completely insane.  Rush the field and take whatever you can.  People used to take the bases and run out of there and, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  Some people were smart enough, they not only ran on the field, they knew where they were  going.  They were running right for, they won at home plate.  Yeah.  And they would try to grab that and just run out of the stadium as everyone else is rushing  the field.  They're, like, getting recruited on their way off the field by the management.  They're, like, hey, we need that guy. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  Bunch of people fighting after the World Series ring trying to break Joe Pepitone's Coke  spoon in hand.  That's the local references of the degenerates we've had around here.  Hey, I want that Holly Hobby doll from Luis Polonia's car.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Good old Luis.  Let's see.  Let's go to Cindy in PA. 
[00:43:30]  Cindy.  What's up, Cindy?  Listen, I used to listen to you on 94.1 WYSP and the last week or so, you're not on that  station anymore.  Yeah.  And I just wondered what happened.  Oh, boy, we went over it a lot, but they are stupid enough to think they need to go in  another direction, so we're actively looking for a new home in Philadelphia.  Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.  I've been listening to you since I lived in Brooklyn.  Okay.  I'll keep watching out for you. 
[00:44:00]  All right.  Thank you.  You can still listen to us, by the way.  I know.  Really?  All right.  Well, I guess you're not there.  Okay.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  F-Y-S-P.  F-O-M.  By the way, are we on in Chicago today?  Because our days are numbered in Chicago.  I at least want to be able to say goodbye to the audience we did have in Chicago.  Once we get the boot, we can always call Steve Dahl and ask if he'll send a message.  Yeah, there you go.  Well, it was reported that Steve Dahl's going to another station in due mornings, and the 
[00:44:30]  station we're being heard on, CKG, is going to some kind of Spanish programming.  Oh, really?  So unless we-  By caramba.  I did six years of Spanish.  Oh, really?  Maybe if I brush up, maybe we could save this gig.  El Choco-Chocos.  That's-  You took it from Lucille Ball?  Right.  That's Lucy Spanish.  He's going to another station, huh?  Uh, yeah.  Dahl is moving to another station, and I guess this station's going Spanish. 
[00:45:00]  So I just want to say goodbye to everyone in Chicago before it happens, because they  never tell you when it does happen.  No, they don't.  God forbid you can say goodbye to the audience.  Yeah, all of a sudden, you're just gone, and they make believe you never existed.  Yeah, but the people right now, that's six people they're not being considerate of.  All right, we're going to take a quick break.  Copperfield next?  Please.  All right, let's do that next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:45:30]  We got Moose Nose from Whack Bag.  Moose Nose?  On the line.  I want to give Whack Bag some props.  They're actually talking about the radio show.  A little more lately.  Thank you so much.  Hey, Moose Nose, what's up?  Yeah.  Hi.  Moose Nose.  Moose Nose.  Hey.  What's up, buddy?  How you doing?  Not much.  I'm sick, that's all.  You guys are still out in Chicago so far, and as soon as I get to the job, the radio's 
[00:46:00]  all gone on CKG.  Yeah, cool.  I do believe that today might be the announcement.  I'm sorry to hear that.  So if it is, Caja de tu madre, thank you for everything.  You got to talk about one of the worst baseball disasters ever.  Yeah, do we?  What's that?  The disco demolition in 79.  Oh, we've talked about that before. 
[00:46:30]  Thank you, sir.  It's always fun.  Thank you.  Bye.  It's always fun, except this time.  You know your cold medicine just ruined everything, right?  Yeah.  That's what it's supposed to do.  I was just going to say Caja de tu madre to everybody in Chi-Town.  Ah.  Did he say it first?  Did this guy say something in Spanish?  No, he just babbled over.  Oh, he's babbling and babbling and babbling.  He just babbled over you.  He just babbled over you.  He just babbled over you.  I like the guys that work at the station. 
[00:47:00]  They're very nice.  Drew, they're all very supportive.  Drew Hayes rocks.  Yeah.  Really good dude, man.  Steve Dahl.  Thanks to everybody.  Steve Dahl rocks.  They both bleeds in the show and helped us try to make something of ourselves in Chicago.  And Steve Dahl's producer, who I'd like to sleep with more than I'd like to breathe.  What's his name?  Bill.  Wow.  That old gag.  She's lovely.  I let her kick me around in a room for an hour.  She's wonderful.  I love how we just blurt the same stupid jokes out. 
[00:47:30]  We're a couple of mows in a room.  What's the matter?  We're all over again.  What's his name?  Oh, it's a guy.  I get it.  And Bill.  Can I have thought of a more creative name?  Bill.  Hello, Bill.  Continued success for Steve Dahl as he moves to another station.  But I don't get it, man.  I know the show is way better than a show like Eric and Kathy's.  But I don't know, man.  For some reason, they like what they like out there. 
[00:48:00]  Whatever.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  Whatever.  Let's say hi to Ziggy.  I'm here on a daily basis and have fun.  Let's say hi to Ziggy.  Ziggy!  Hop up in that gag.  What up?  Hey, man.  It's Itchy Fish Ziggy.  Oh, no kidding.  What's up, bud?  I got my free couch out last night from Jordan's Furniture because the Red Sox won the World Series.  Yeah, what was that all about?  They did a promotion for like a three-week span if you bought any amount of furniture in those weeks free. 
[00:48:30]  100% free.  Well, they did an insurance policy, but.  Yeah, the insurance.  They take out like a contest insurance policy because they'd go broke.  Ziggy speaks the truth, by the way.  Free furniture sits well with faithful fans.  Thousands of Red Sox fans are sitting pretty on their new free World Series furniture from Jordan's.  Others are kicking themselves on their old stuff.  The happier ones took advantage of the Jordan's Furniture promotional offer for full rebates if the Sox win the World Series.  Wow.  Jordan's Furniture promised free sofas, chairs, and beds to customers who bought between March 7th and April 16th if the Red Sox won the World Series. 
[00:49:00]  Jordan's took about 30,000 orders during the promotion.  But what did Bernie and Phil do?  I'm going to get to that in a second.  Okay, Chief Executive Blah Blah hasn't disclosed how much the rebates would be, but he won't have to pay it all.  He bought an insurance policy to cover losses in case of the sweep.  30,000 people took advantage of this.  Wow.  So I guess it was a way to get you into the Jordans, you know, to buy Furniture, like between this date and that date. 
[00:49:30]  And then he's hoping that the Sox don't win.  Wow.  And then he just makes a lot of money.  Yeah.  And even so, the insurance company pays for it, so he still makes a lot of money.  There you go, Ziggy.  Congratulations to you.  All right, guys.  Hey, tell me if this sounds like a phone hanging up.  Anyway, speaking of Bernie and Phil, when we were getting ready to take the train back to New York on Saturday,  a Bernie and Phil commercial came on, but it's not the old couple anymore.  Have they finally moved on?  They don't have Bernie and Phil anymore. 
[00:50:00]  They're huge institutions in Boston as far as furniture sales go.  And they did their own commercials when we were up there.  And they're just the worst collection of commercials ever.  But it was them.  And they'd act out little skits and sketches.  One of my favorites was when Bernie, who is the guy, and Phil, who's the woman, the wife.  But barely.  His name's Phyllis.  But he would call her Phil. 
[00:50:30]  He woke up on the couch and goes, I had a nightmare, Dr. Phil.  And she was his psychiatrist.  And it goes through this whole thing.  I dreamt we were selling furniture at much too higher price.  Well, that's impossible, Bernie.  And they just go back and forth with this lame conversation about furniture.  It had nothing to do with furniture.  It was horrible.  But, man, they are huge up there.  Just like a ship captain.  Aye, aye, first mate, Phil. 
[00:51:00]  Where are we steaming off to, Bernie?  We're steaming off to furniture savings.  Are you?  Hit an iceberg.  Or to the David Copperfield rape island.  I'm doing the Leon Klinghoffer impression.  Some savage is going to throw me overboard.  In a comfy chair.  We're getting info on this.  Maybe we shouldn't be making fun.  James in New Hampshire, what's up?  Hey, gentlemen. 
[00:51:30]  Hey.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Just an update.  The new people on it are Bernie and Phil's kids.  Because Phil is shaking like Michael J. Fox nowadays.  No.  Oh, yeah.  They put her on every now and again.  She'll still be in it.  But she won't talk that much.  And she'll just be just shaking like there's a good tune on.  Hey, Phil, is this our new vibrating bed?  No, Bernie.  I just need my medication.  Watch it out. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, that's not cool, man.  We loved Bernie and Phil when we were up there.  Oh, God.  Remember the Western one they did where Bernie had the big...  I think he was the sheriff.  I'm a sheriff.  And as the sheriff, I'm making it the law to make lower prices on our furniture.  Oh, Bernie.  Bernie, look at the loons.  I'm trying to find pictures.  I don't know what they look like.  Oh, they were just old fossils back then.  We absolutely loved Bernie and Phil. 
[00:52:30]  We couldn't get enough of them.  I don't see any Bernie and Phil.  Bernie and Phil.  Let's say hi to Nancy in New York.  Nancy, what's going on today?  Actually, I called because my alarm clock went off.  And I didn't know whether the...  That's what I do.  When my alarm goes off, boom, I call the radio station.  Absolutely.  That's right.  Get right on the live radio to wake me up.  Hello.  What's up, Nancy?  Did I win the contest?  That's all I want to know.  Yes.  If the contest was the first dumb whore to call after the 7 o'clock hour, you would  be the winner.  Oh, well, that's me. 
[00:53:00]  Sorry.  That was a little harsh.  Nancy, Nancy.  Phil is not working at Home Depot and the paint department as a paint shaker.  Come on.  Some reports are coming in, and I don't believe that is true.  Nancy, good news for you.  We have not played the sounder yet, so hang in there, okay?  Okay.  Thanks.  All right, you got $1,000 up for grab still sometime between now and 7.30.  All right?  So I'm so mean to Nancy.  So Bernie and Phil, blah, blah, blah.  All right, you want to do the Copperfield thing?  Yeah, I love this story. 
[00:53:30]  Ooh, do I love it.  This beast, this animal.  Funny about David Copperfield, he's a big Otto and George fan, loves Otto and George.  All right, now it's making more sense.  Yeah, of course it is.  And I don't know Copperfield.  I met him one time.  I walked into the comedy cellar years ago.  We had a big meeting among the comedians.  And something was going on there.  And that night at the show, in the back, was Copperfield.  Yeah.  Just sitting there by himself.  And I walk over to him.  And he goes, hey, I like that movie you did with Louis Black. 
[00:54:00]  Ooh.  And he signed an autograph.  I never saw him again.  But he loves Otto.  Wow.  Really?  Yeah, I love Otto and George.  Did he disappear or something?  Yeah, he just pulled something over his head and then he was gone.  Yeah, I made my face look like a chair cushion.  And then I motioned for Claudia Schiffer to come over.  Take a load off.  Yeah, he was.  Was he married to Claudia Schiffer?  Or are they just going out?  I don't know.  Married for a while.  He picked her up when she was pretty young on the modeling circuit.  And now it seems he's got this thing going on that allegedly, allegedly, police are investigating. 
[00:54:30]  The FBI has his computer.  They're looking through emails and stuff.  But allegedly, he's been using his notoriety and fame to pluck young, naive, blonde girls out of the audience.  And either talk to them to see what their vibe's all about.  Or take it even further.  And I guess taking it to the utmost is what happened with this latest victim.  She has reported him to the police on rape allegations. 
[00:55:00]  And the story behind it, though, is just so Copperfield.  You can't just grab a woman and rape her in a hotel room like some basketball star or something like that.  He has to make it very elaborate.  It's like one of his tricks.  It's very elaborate.  He purchased an island a while ago.  He bought Rape Island.  Rape Island.  He bought it like a few years back, I guess. 
[00:55:30]  When you have that much money, that much Vegas money, you can buy your own island.  Highest paid act in Vegas for a long time.  So he's got this huge island.  The only way to get to it is you have to take a plane.  And then some kind of a short sea hop plane.  One of those little sea planes.  And then a boat.  You got to take it then.  A boat.  And then you're on the island.  So he's talking to this girl.  She comes in with her family. 
[00:56:00]  She's 21 years old.  Blonde girl.  And he instantly swoops down and starts chatting with the whole family.  Gets them all backstage.  But he singles the girl out.  And this is all her complaint.  And starts talking to her.  She wants to get into modeling.  So, of course, David Copperfield.  David Copperfield.  Can help with her modeling career.  So he invites her to his private island.  To a big party, he says. 
[00:56:30]  To network, meet people, and discuss her modeling career.  So she takes this friggin', I don't know, 18-day excursion to try to get to his island.  It's like the island on Lost once you get there.  You don't know what's going to happen.  So she goes through the planes and the boat.  Gets to the island.  And much to her horror, she realizes there is no party.  It is just David Copperfield and her.  And an island.  He's standing there at the dock with a hammer and some rohypnol. 
[00:57:00]  She says then they.  But she was the only one that was dropped off on the island?  That sounds a little.  That sounds almost impossible.  That was it.  Just her.  This is what she is alleging.  Okay.  That she was alone on the island with David Copperfield.  Yes.  Very frightening.  The swashbuckling David Copperfield.  With a knife in his teeth and no pants. 
[00:57:30]  So she, I guess, gets off of the boat and goes to the house and starts slowly realizing there's no one else there.  All alone with David Copperfield.  Was he moving his hands like a magician?  Making her dignity disappear?  Yes.  Making black eyes appear.  Yeah. 
[00:58:00]  So apparently then she alleges that she, for two days.  He copped a field.  Yes.  That's where the name comes from.  She was beaten and raped by none other than David Copperfield.  Copperfield. 
[00:58:30]  You are never to blame.  By the way, kids, rape is not funny.  Of course not.  We're just trying to be shocking.  She was, yeah.  And then she gets, he just sends her back out on the boat.  Just ships her off like some cargo.  Ships her off. 
[00:59:00]  And she got home.  I guess she lived in Washington.  And immediately told her parents, who then took her down to the hospital, the police.  They did a rape test.  They've taken some samples off her clothing.  Some suspicious samples off her clothing.  How anxious was he?  Man.  Yeah, right.  I know.  There should never be samples on the clothing.  No, your bodily fluid should never be on her shoes.  That's not the sign of a patient, man.  It's like on her parka. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  And her hair, her earrings and her shoes.  None on her skin.  He couldn't wait.  Right there on the boat dock.  And then he just sent her back.  Oh, my God.  You showed up.  And then he grabbed my leg and he humped like a little dog.  And then he threw me back on the Cessna.  Yeah, it throws her back.  And now he's going to try to make a rape charge disappear.  Yeah.  Good luck there.  The FBI has seized all the emails because apparently they had some email correspondence back and forth. 
[01:00:00]  And they're starting to say that maybe this isn't the first time this has happened on Rape Island.  Did you hear about this warehouse of his in L.A.?  No.  It's like a warehouse where he stores all his magic stuff.  All his magical tricks.  And it's like, I guess it's massive.  It's like this massive warehouse.  And you know how you get into the warehouse?  How?  Through a sex shop.  I was reading.  Does he own that?  Maybe we can find the story.  But you have to do something in the sex shop to get to the secret door. 
[01:00:30]  And then he has the key after, I guess, like a secret panel is revealed or pushed away or whatever.  How do they bring stuff in?  Like ship it in.  There's got to be a warehouse entry.  There must be another way in, I guess.  But that's how he goes in.  Supposedly he brought a reporter or somebody and they had to go through a sex shop.  Yes.  Secret door in a sex shop.  Meanwhile, around back, there's 18 loading docks.  I don't get it.  Just people working.  And now you've got to put your mouth by this hole in the wall.  That's a key.  And the key comes through.  And then you have some key juice. 
[01:01:00]  And you gargle with the key juice and question yourself as you walk around back to the loading dock.  Key juice.  Let's go to Eric in Connecticut.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, Eric.  Hello?  Yes.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, we're in the middle of our David Copperfield bit.  What's up?  I thought I heard the sound of the day. 
[01:01:30]  Chris in Jersey, what's up?  Yeah, what's up?  Hey.  I think I heard the sound of the day.  Samantha, Jersey, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  What's up?  Hi, Sam.  What's up?  What's up, Samantha?  I'm driving home from work.  I was listening to your show.  Yeah. 
[01:02:00]  And I thought I'd call in and chat.  No, you thought you heard the sound, too, didn't you?  No, if I thought I heard the sound, I would have said, hey.  Oh, God.  What I love the most is interacting with the audience.  You never know what to expect.  David Copperfield.  It's different every night.  David Copperfield eyes a woman in the audience at one of his Vegas shows.  He came on stage, and it was creepy.  My husband leaned over and said, like, he keeps looking at you.  It was weird.  I did not want to be going on stage. 
[01:02:30]  He actually came down and pulled me up on stage.  As TMZ first reported during his shows, when David thought a woman was hot,  he used the code word mama, which told his assistant the magician wanted more.  He did say mama, which was weird.  By the way, I told the story on the air.  When we were in Vegas, Copperfield grabbed my chance out of the audience to be an assistant on stage.  Really?  Yeah.  And he was just like, it was blonde.  And I remember at the time, it was kind of creepy because he was like, he was combing the audience, 
[01:03:00]  just looking around, looking around.  And then his eyes locked on her.  And I went, he's coming to get you.  Oh, boy.  And she's like, no way, no way, no way.  And sure enough, he came right up to her, grabbed her.  And she was an assistant on stage for one of his tricks.  Wow.  And then at the end, he made her kiss his cheek and go, remember who got you over your stage, right?  Yeah, exactly.  How about it then, guys?  I don't think I went to the mama stage where, you know, all of a sudden she's being, you know, dragged backstage. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  Who knows what to have?  Whisked off to Rape Island.  Yeah, no kidding.  It didn't get to that point, but I saw this whole thing go down.  I was an eyewitness to it the last time we were in Vegas.  We went to that dumb Copperfield show.  And I even came back to New York and said how awful it was and how dated his dumb Vegas show was.  But he did drag my girl up on stage to help with one of the tricks.  Maybe he doesn't get certain vibes.  Maybe he didn't get the certain vibes of her.  Or maybe he's weird with, like, he saw the boyfriend. 
[01:04:00]  Maybe there's different things that would go into, like, eh, this is not going to happen.  Steve from Bay Show is saying he couldn't make up his mind between Lindsay or Opie.  How about the other time?  This is not the first time this happened in Vegas, by the way.  Can you say the N-word for the thing on the girl?  Probably not.  Wait, I'm trying to figure that out.  Oh, oh, that.  See, because the N-word is only one word for me.  Well, we're going to go N-word, woman, chest. 
[01:04:30]  Can I say that?  So when you hear the N-word, that's what I mean.  $25,000 pyramid?  Well, remember I was telling you about the sex shop and how he gets in?  This is how he, I knew I read this somewhere.  The Illusionist gave the Jackmans a tour.  The Jackmans?  Well, when Hugh Jackman was in The Illusionist, right?  But they were somewhat taken aback when showing the entrance via an adjacent sex shop.  So there's a sex shop next to his warehouse, his hidden warehouse. 
[01:05:00]  He went into the sex shop and then he pushed the N-word.  Oh, you've got to push the...  Of a mannequin triggering the release of the warehouse doors.  It's like Clockwork Orange when he wanted some milk in the car.  Here's more from one of the victims here of Copperfield's scam.  One of his assistants came to where we were sitting and just said,  if you guys would just wait, David wants to meet you.  And I said, I can't bring my husband, and she said no. 
[01:05:30]  Backstage, David did his thing.  He took a picture with me with the digital camera.  And he took like a full body shot and then a head shot and then made me turn and do almost like a profile shot.  Then, the dossier.  She gave me a survey to fill out, asked me what kind of jeans I like to wear,  the whole cologne question, some personal questions.  I think there was like your height and your weight, describing what you look like, all that.  And then she talks about the Bahamas. 
[01:06:00]  Can I tell you something?  This woman is as dumb as they come.  And I'm kind of bummed that they didn't pick up on this at TMZ.  This is how he gets info so he could use it in his stage act.  In his act.  And all of a sudden, it's like, oh my God, this guy's amazing.  He knew everything about this woman.  Yep.  That's all he was doing.  That's all he was doing.  After the show, though.  I don't know if it was before or I don't know.  But it's so obvious.  Those questions are like going to be used somehow in one of his tricks.  Because I'm saying, well, is that because he wants to have the clothes that she wants there? 
[01:06:30]  If you say, let's go backstage and don't bring your husband, why do you allow that as the husband?  And why is the wife you okay?  I'm a pervert and I would never say, leave your husband outside.  You can't do it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But husband's going to go, all right, honey, go have fun.  With David Copperfield.  David Copperfield is so mysterious.  A guy that's pretty much a billionaire.  You just go have fun.  I'll sit out here.  Yeah, my fat Midwestern gut's sticking out.  And worry about how we're going to pay for this Vegas trip when we get back to Omaha.  Yeah, you just go have fun with the billionaire.  Or maybe it's... 
[01:07:00]  I'm going to play a couple rounds of Blackjack.  Or maybe it's go in there and take one for the team.  We can sell them and the Vegas trip is taken care of.  I lost six G's.  Right.  Go to the sex shop, stupid.  Help us out.  Two months later, she got an email from David's assistant trying to reestablish contact.  I got an email from one of his assistants saying, David would like to contact you.  The story is similar to Amanda from Atlanta.  He kept eyeing me throughout the show.  I did notice a lot. 
[01:07:30]  I do need to borrow a lady from the audience.  The FBI has seized Copperfield's digital camera equipment and computer hard drive after  a Seattle woman claimed Copperfield sexually assaulted her in the Bahamas.  Today, the National Enquirer reports Copperfield allegedly used the same ammo on his accuser.  And after the alleged assault, tried to buy her silence by offering her two million bucks.  Copperfield denies any wrongdoing.  So what he does...  First of all, she's a blabbermouth. 
[01:08:00]  Two million, shut your face.  And second of all, he would have all these digital pictures.  He would just look at them probably.  And that's what I would do.  I would look at them and then go, oh my God, that one was hot.  How great to have an assistant.  That's what I need.  An assistant.  Contact her.  They just start snapping pictures and then you choose a couple of mil.  It's not rape if you're going to be paid two million.  Well, if she takes the two mil.  Yeah.  How do you know?  She doesn't.  It's pretty much rape.  Why are you raping people when you have that much money? 
[01:08:30]  Do you get that spoil that you're so used to getting whatever you want?  I don't understand the appeal of rape when you could just go, no?  Okay, no?  Okay, yes.  If he's smacking a girl around and forcing himself on her, if he's doing that, there's  something more going on than just, hey, I'm into a little bit of kink.  You know, this guy's got some, if that's the case, this guy has some really serious issues.  Well, what do you think?  Don't know.  Too soon to tell. 
[01:09:00]  I need more facts.  I need to go to Rape Island and do my own investigation.  Sounds like there's something there, but I don't know.  It's pretty wild.  If he offered a two million and she didn't take it, that's a big one.  He must have been a bad boy.  Well, she probably knows she can get a lot more than two million by getting him convicted.  We got some sounds from Rape Island.  Is that him trying to lull her into a false sense of security? 
[01:09:30]  All right, we got to take a quick break.  I know that was a stretch today.  I'll acknowledge that.  I honestly didn't see it coming.  I did not know what clip you were going to play.  I'm like, oh, that makes sense.  Bit of a stretch today.  We'll be back.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Good morning.  Thanks for checking us out today.  Still got lots to do.  We want to talk about Al Roker a little bit today. 
[01:10:00]  Hey, he wasn't offended by the Friars Club N-Bomb thing that we discussed.  No.  We'll explain a little later.  Also a second grade teacher, blindfolding girls, putting toppings on his...  No way.  On his, on his, on his...  No way.  Topping meter.  And then making them play the tasting game.  Are you kidding me? 
[01:10:30]  How did that story get past me?  Minorities less likely to trick-or-treat.  They do trick-or-treat.  Oh, really?  They do with a gun and they say carjacking.  That's not what I saw.  Thanks, Eric.  Yeah, they're less likely to trick-or-treat.  We'll get into that story a little bit.  We have a dummy attempting to exit a plane mid-flight through the emergency door.  Trick never works. 
[01:11:00]  We got a blind man shooting a home invader.  We'll get into that a little later.  A blind guy?  Yeah, we'll get...  Hopefully we'll do that real soon.  Awful home invader.  And then a hunter either photographs Bigfoot or a bear with a bad skin condition.  I did a little Google search.  I threw Bigfoot in there.  Yeah.  Lame.  Really?  You got the famous picture from the video.  But you got Paris Hilton.  Ugly, disgusting, big feet she's got.  And then you got a lot of Photoshop crap. 
[01:11:30]  Look up, is this the face of Bigfoot?  And then there's like this face and it's like the woods that someone took a picture.  And then you look closely in the woods and it looks like it could be the face of Bigfoot.  But it's so fake.  Look at that.  Not the face of Bigfoot.  Anyway, you can do that at home.  But it's just lame.  There is no face of Bigfoot.  No.  There is no Bigfoot.  All right.  We got to say hi to Annette in New York.  Annette.  Annette.  Cigarette.  Annette, you've been trying to win the $1,000 a lot, right? 
[01:12:00]  Yes.  Yeah.  It's just about dancing.  Right?  Yes.  And you've been suffering with this radio show, haven't you?  No, I love your radio show.  Oh, man.  Then it's really going to hurt me to tell you that you're the ninth caller.  I'm sorry.  Damn.  All right.  I swear to God, I'm sorry.  Okay, thanks anyway.  See, now you're a...  I hate doing that to a real fan.  It's actually Greg.  Greg's the winner today.  Greg?  Greg, you won $1,000, sir. 
[01:12:30]  Hey, thanks, guys.  I appreciate it.  It's going to come in great.  You just come in this upcoming week for me.  Why?  What happened?  I'm going to Vegas.  Oh, you're going to Vegas?  Yeah.  All right.  Put it all on black.  Yeah, what are you going to do with the $1,000?  Pay for the trip, or are you going to actually use it to gamble?  No, actually use it to gamble, of course.  Or bring your wife to see David Copperfield and try to parlay it into $2 million.  That's the real bet in Vegas.  Yeah.  How many...  Exactly.  How many guys...  Fucking fat girls in blonde wigs.  Go ahead. 
[01:13:00]  Go smile at them.  Will you just take one for the team already?  You know what we could do with $2 million?  All right.  Well, congratulations, Greg.  Have fun in Vegas, okay?  Thanks, guys.  I appreciate it.  Are you a fan of the show?  Oh, yes, I am.  Going back to the first day.  Oh, that's good to hear.  Thanks, Greg.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  There you go.  We've got to figure out what the sound's going to be for tomorrow, so stick with us for a  little longer, and we'll figure that out.  Or, Anthony, you pick one sometime in the next 15 minutes. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, I'm looking around on the screen.  You don't have to do it right to the second, but there you go.  Oh, we had a thought.  Oh, Fantasy Island.  Oh, I just, we were kind of hashing out the fact that he should at least not just be alone  there, but maybe just have some greeters on the island to at least make the girl feel  a little better, I think.  Yeah.  Be better than just the plane showing up and her getting off all alone and David Copperfield 
[01:14:00]  being there.  And, I don't know, put her at ease a little bit.  The plane.  The plane.  Ah, yeah.  Yeah, see, that always relaxed them a little more.  That was always, remember?  Yes.  Tears.  Tears, everyone.  Welcome to David Copperfield's Rape Island.  The plane.  The plane.  She was very badly raped, you see?  Yes.  Come in. 
[01:14:30]  Take, take your clothes off, or I will do it for you.  Where are my punches?  Damn, you've just been punged.  I used to like when Tattoo would always ask what the fantasy was, and Mr. Work would have  to go through the explanation.  Yeah.  Well, Tattoo, she wants to lay on a rose petal and then be kicked in the face and repeatedly 
[01:15:00]  sodomized while somebody yells  ta-da!  There you go, that was a fantastic  tattoo of David Copperfield.  She wants to be  sawed in half with a  hanky over her face with magical  sleeping fumes in it.  Magical. 
[01:15:30]  That isn't a very good Mr. Rourke.  Let's say hi to Karen, Jersey.  Does it matter?  It could be Khan.  They get the point.  Kara, what's up?  Hi, good morning.  Good morning, Kara, how are you today?  Good, I heard the sound bite.  Of course you did.  Yes.  Welcome to F.H. Island.  Hey, hey.  That's the parking lot out back. 
[01:16:00]  F.H. Island.  Ah!  Oh!  Oh!  I like turtles.  Of course.  Oh.  All right.  Kara!  Do you want to kiss me?  I'm going to kiss you on the mouth.  Ah, yes, Kara.  Kara? 
[01:16:30]  Yes, here.  Kara.  Yes.  Show me with your mouth.  Show me with your mouth.  Kara?  Kara?  Yes.  You can't possibly think the $1,000 is still up for grabs.  Why not?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Hope is a virtue.  Hope is a virtue?  No, it's not.  Is it?  Hope is not a virtue. 
[01:17:00]  Patience is a virtue.  Right.  Yeah.  Well, even if it's not, that is one of my favorite sound clips.  I remember when you had that.  Jared in Boston, what's up?  Poor girl.  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Hey, good.  Was David Copperfield's victim's name Aaron?  Ooh, you linger.  Linger Linger.  Wow.  Linger Linger.  That one goes back.  All right.  Why don't we get to E-Rock's air check?  I love, by the way, on Fantasy Island, I would love when Tattoo would talk how they would 
[01:17:30]  just play the midget plink-a-link-a-link music.  Plink-a-link-a-link.  It would just become like a...  De-shame.  De-shame.  Well, Tattoo, she wants to see a midget shoot himself through a pillow.  Hey, can you get Rob Bartlett, too, from I Miss' show?  He'd stop by to say hi.  Well, while he says, ow, it hurts.  He said that?  Oh, yeah.  Apparently, he recorded it. 
[01:18:00]  He audio recorded his own suicide little tattoo, and it was pretty horrible.  There he is.  How you doing, Rob?  What's up, Rob?  I got the phrase that pays.  You got the phrase that pays today?  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  Ooh, ooh.  I'm a prize whore.  A prize whore.  We got plenty of them.  I hear.  You like the prize pigs when they call them?  The prize pigs?  It's just, it's so lame.  Please, God. 
[01:18:30]  Well, that's what radios come down for.  They call it before and after.  Yeah.  Never just in a nick of time.  That's because they come from Philly.  That's why.  Hey, leave Philly alone.  Leave Philly alone.  All right, Rob, we're going to get to what you're doing, but we got E-Rock and his air  check.  Oh.  People have been, like, waiting for it for the last week.  It's an e-check.  Have you alerted the Museum of Broadcasting?  Yeah, we should.  Yeah, this absolutely needs to be inducted.  What are you eating?  In the what never to do section. 
[01:19:00]  Well, we got to play the first part again.  What is he eating today?  Cheerios.  Cheerios.  Regular Cheerios.  The berry Cheerios.  What are berry Cheerios?  And are they real?  We already went over the berry Cheerios from the other day.  He kind of slinked away as Jimmy crushed his box of cereal.  No.  What are they, those sugar-dried fruit things?  He just got another box of the kind that Jimmy stomped on.  What kind of milk do you have in them? 
[01:19:30]  Regular?  1% low-fat.  That's good.  Very good.  You take care of the 99%.  1% and he just drops his neck in the bowl.  Are they real blueberries?  Blueberries.  You want to go longer.  Blueberries.  I'm part of the lakers longer.  So when are you going to work for Imus again?  I hope soon.  Because I'm tired of eating SpaghettiOs.  You're going to be part of the new lineup, right? 
[01:20:00]  Ramen noodles.  I only know what I read in the paper because, you know, when I speak to him, he's like,  well, you can't be trusted.  I can't tell you anything.  You can't be trusted.  But he's supposed to start in like a month.  Well, you know, my bags are packed.  I'm ready to go.  You're ready to roll.  Waiting for the call.  Could this be your last appearance on our show?  Or one of many.  Depending on what goes down over the next couple of weeks.  No, I'm assuming I'll get the call.  But, you know.  Yeah.  All right.  You never say until you get the, you know.  First of all, you don't want to jinx it. 
[01:20:30]  Number one.  And number two, you got to, you know, get the paper.  Yeah.  Put your name in the paper.  Well, Rob said to me before, he dares Imus to replace him.  Speaking of Imus, we got a quickie.  You know that Al Roker, like, pretty much demanded that Imus get fired for saying what he said on his radio show.  From the MSNBC side.  Yeah.  Well, and, yeah, he was outraged by that type of language on a radio show.  And then we're at the Friars Club for the Pat Cooper roast, and the N-word was being thrown around like crazy. 
[01:21:00]  And there's Al Roker laughing it up on the dais.  And I couldn't believe it.  I'm a little hypocritical.  And he's finally has put out a statement about that.  Do you have that, Jimmy?  Did he?  I did.  I might have thrown it out.  I know he wasn't that.  It says here.  Ooh.  Roker not offended at Friars N-bomb.  Al Roker was only mildly offended when host Lisa Lampanelli dropped the N-bomb during Pat Cooper's recent Friars Club roast. 
[01:21:30]  It was off-color, Roker, who was on the dais, told us at the Quill Awards Monday night.  But at the same time, it's one of those things where it's just a joke, and you're at the Friars Club, so you kind of expect that.  But see, that's what you expect from a radio show or a Don Imus radio show.  An edgy radio show.  So it's kind of being hypocritical because Imus was just doing his job and following FCC regulations.  So really, Al, what's the difference? 
[01:22:00]  And Lisa Lampanelli did, in her defense, come with Ted Danson.  Yes.  She was really good that night.  She was great.  And Gilbert dropped it, and Pat dropped it.  Yeah, there were a few people that dropped the N-bomb, as they call it.  And Al thinks it's okay.  I guess it's different.  Yeah.  I guess it's different.  I wonder if you would have asked him in public, do you think there's any place for that word?  He probably would have said no.  I don't know for sure, but judging on his past performance there, I bet he would have said, 
[01:22:30]  no, there's no place for that word.  Except the Friars Club when I'm hanging out and laughing my ass off when people drop it.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, anyway, that's a quickie.  Ginger in Jersey.  What's up, Ginger?  Hi.  Ginger?  Hi.  Ginger?  She hung up.  She heard the sound.  Of course she did, but this contest is over.  That was Opie doing it, by the way. 
[01:23:00]  Opie does a great impression of the Poe.  Opie does a great impression of the first part.  That's amazing.  I went a little deeper on that one.  Right there.  It's great.  Yeah.  Uncanny.  I had it as a ringtone for so long.  I got it nailed.  I got that one.  Hey, all right.  Let's do some E-Rock radio. 
[01:23:30]  This part you heard, but then we're going to play some new stuff from E-Rock's air check.  E-Rock, back in the day, where were you?  WGNX in Vero Beach, Florida.  All right.  And, Rob, you could pile on and beat them up like we're about to do.  So, you were doing Sunday nights?  No, Monday through Friday, 7 to 11.  Oh, Night Jock.  The nighttime attitude with E-Rock.  Linger longer.  All right.  Here's E-Rock.  Let's get right to it.  Hey, Sunday nights. 
[01:24:00]  GNX is the place to be.  Violent Femmes, Psychedelic Furs, Susie and the Banshees, Haircut 100, B-52s, Michael Penn, Joe Boxers, and plenty, plenty more.  So, original MTV DJ Nina Blackwood takes you through three hours of the new Wave Nation every Sunday night from 9 to midnight on 99.7 GNX.  Hey, GNX.  Yeah, hey there.  Can you, like, play Pride by U2?  I can, like, do that for you.  Thanks.  What's your, like, name?  This is Brian.  Brian, where are you, like, calling from?  In my car.  I'm out delivering pizzas.  Oh, what pizzas?  Papa John's. 
[01:24:30]  My favorite.  Of course it is.  Why wouldn't it be?  A hubcap with sauce on it.  My favorite.  You know where the station is, right?  Could you come by here, please?  He could have said anything and it would have been his favorite.  Creamed corn.  Wow.  My favorite.  My favorite.  Oh, God.  And that too cool for the room.  Yeah, like, where are you from?  Like, because the guy said like.  I understand that. 
[01:25:00]  But then you, like, kept doing it and, like, tried to be, like, too cool for the room.  Like.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I understand.  Cool DJ.  Just happy to be there.  Talking over the music.  Did he get food delivered every night?  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sure.  Every Thursday and Friday.  My favorite.  What did he get every Thursday and Friday?  It was an alternate between pizza, checkers.  Checkers.  And I forgot the third one, but.  You ate Nixon's dog?  Checkers is like a burger place.  Which is pretty much like eating Nixon's dog. 
[01:25:30]  Checkers.  All right.  Let's.  I think.  I want checkers.  I think we're finally moving on.  More, uh.  E-rocket.  For you?  Thanks.  What's your, like, name?  This is Brian.  Brian.  Where are you, like, calling from?  In my car.  I'm out delivering pizzas.  Oh, what pizzas?  Papa John.  My favorite.  I love the garlic butter sauce.  Well, next time you're in the area, make sure you stop by, all right?  Nice edit.  Nice edit, too.  I love the garlic butter.  So, next time you're in, like, the old tape razor blade edit. 
[01:26:00]  On the 360.  On the 360.  Oh, is it the 360?  That is a sloppy-ass edit.  Wait, so you wanted him to stop by with some pizza if he was in the area?  Yeah.  I didn't notice the edit.  I didn't notice it.  Oh, listen closely.  You can hear it.  I love the garlic butter sauce.  Well, next time you're in the area.  Garlic sauce.  Like, he must have talked over your S.  Yeah, yeah, probably.  You know, I love the garlic butter sauce.  Or maybe you were shoving food in your mouth and couldn't finish the word. 
[01:26:30]  No, he had to cut off the rest of what he said, which is, I love the garlic butter sauce  and well-endowed men.  There's your sound for tomorrow's contest.  I love the garlic butter sauce.  Hey, yeah, we could use that.  All right.  Wait, can you clean that up?  And then we'll play it as the sound for tomorrow?  That's not a bad idea.  Oh, what pizzas?  Proper John.  My favorite.  I love the garlic butter sauce.  Well, next time you're in the area, make sure you stop by, all right?  Okay, will do. 
[01:27:00]  Okay, man.  Bye.  Bye.  Baseball season is here.  Oh, that was a good one.  I could see it.  Baseball season.  Baseball season.  Is that you doing a commercial?  Yeah.  Ooh.  Bye.  Bye.  Baseball season is here and the Los Angeles Dodgers are back.  Back at Holman Stadium at Vero Beach's own Dodger Town.  Better than ever.  14 games for less than.  Oh, God.  Listen to you rambling through that.  Every freaking radio commercial cliche.  Listen to you rambling through that.  And I know you didn't write the copy, so you got to give them a little bit of a pass.  But it's a no-one-gives-a-crap delivery, too. 
[01:27:30]  It's just like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I love that back and better-than-ever crap.  Yeah.  Just awful.  What do you expect for them to be back and just, bah, we're just going to kind of lose  every game?  See, I thought he was very believable.  I really felt that he had something for the Dodgers.  Just bad summer radio.  And by the way, this is a commercial for minor, not minor, spring season.  Spring training.  Spring training.  Spring training.  Sorry.  Very big, yeah. 
[01:28:00]  In that area, the Dodgers are the big home team.  Yeah, there's spring training campers right there in Vero Beach, so they show up a couple  times a year.  It's a big deal.  The Dodgers are back.  It's okay, man.  Bye.  Bye.  Baseball season is here, and the Los Angeles Dodgers are back.  Back at Holman Stadium at Vero Beach's own Dodger Town.  Better than ever, 14 games for less than $200.  14 exciting spring training games with our Los Angeles Dodgers taking on the Florida Marlins,  St. Louis Cardinals, Atlanta Braves, Houston Astros, and the New York Men. 
[01:28:30]  Pearl Jam, I am mine on the rock station, 99.7 G and X.  I'm Sex Bagel.  Give me a call.  I've never heard you say that you're a sex bagel.  This is a first for the show.  I would have respected you more if you said, I'm John Mark Carr.  Oh, God.  Scott Muti is rolling in his gray.  I'm not good.  I'm not good.  I'm not good. 
[01:29:00]  I'm not good.  Sex Bagel.  I'm not good.  Haircut 100.  Oh, Sex Bagel.  Right after me, it's Sex Bagel.  Sex Bagel.  Keep it tuned to the Sex Bagel.  Yeah.  Playing your alternative rock right after me.  Scott Muti.  Coming up after Sex Bagel is Rape Croissant.  Rape Croissant.  Oh, God damn.  I'm Sex Bagel.  Do you think that was going to take off?  Sex Bagel stinks. 
[01:29:30]  A little ONA history, when we discovered Sex Bagel and he told us he was Sex Bagel, one  of the first things we did was change your name.  Remember?  There was that whole thing, trying to figure out what to name you.  We almost named you Hawk.  What else?  Something cooler.  Hump Muffin.  I still call him Hawk sometimes.  I don't know why I like that name.  Yeah, Hawk was cool.  He did some fine assaults on the media.  That one famous one, you flapping your wings like a hawk.  Something cooler than Sex Bagel, like tampon. 
[01:30:00]  I got to hear Sex Bagel with you again.  Oh, yeah.  Exciting spring training games with our Los Angeles Dodgers.  Taking on the Florida Marlins, St. Louis Cardinals, Atlanta Braves, Houston Astros, and the New York Met.  Pearl Jam.  I am mine on the rock station, 997-GNX.  I'm Sex Bagel.  Give me a call.  877-997-9469.  That spells out GNX.  In case you didn't know.  Single wireless users, you have pound GNX.  Which, by the way, you know, since we don't run the Metro...  You're just babbling. 
[01:30:30]  Wow.  And he tripped, too.  Like, he's a little stupid lip.  Well, he worked for one of those stations where your delivery had to be...  This part coming up here.  They were proud of the fact...  And they promoted the fact that you could give them local traffic updates.  So, what's come up here is you had to do this twice an hour to promote that they could text you with local traffic updates.  Oh, wow.  His mouth's just not used to moving this much without actual food being in it. 
[01:31:00]  Let's go to Pauline in Connecticut.  Pauline.  Hello.  How are you doing?  Good.  What's up, Pauline?  No, nothing on my way to work, listening to you guys.  Okay.  And?  And I like you.  And?  And?  And?  And?  And?  Hello, hello, hello, hello?  Why are you calling the radio show?  Just for the heck of saying hello.  I know the price.  Holy crap.  Back to you, Ron.  No, single wireless users, you have pound GNX.  Which, by the way, you know, since we don't run the Metro traffic at this hour, it doesn't mean the traffic reports have to stop. 
[01:31:30]  You know?  No.  Oh, perish the thought.  Just be, hey, just because they're not running it, doesn't mean the traffic reports have to stop.  Perish the thought.  Just because it's nine o'clock at night doesn't mean there isn't a pileup somewhere.  Yeah.  Right.  Oh, God.  It's a big rush to go down to the stadium and see those Dodgers.  I actually feel for him, man.  I had to do this crap.  Oh, he's just being a good soldier.  This is just radio crap.  Why don't you just get on and go, this sucks. 
[01:32:00]  Half the liners.  No.  Half the liners that jocks have to read are just crap to fill up space.  Who would, actually, anyone listening to you at that hour, who cares?  They're not listening for dumb traffic.  That rock station format lasted three weeks.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They flipped it from an 80 station, turned it into an alternative rock station, which they  thought the Greaseman would be a good morning show.  Waddle-doodle.  Bone dry.  Stay tuned for a sex bagel. 
[01:32:30]  Sex bagel.  It was sex muffin, but I shot a hole through it while I was slinging lead, and now it's  a bagel.  I might have some of his IDs.  Bagel-de-wool-dee-doo.  Goes good with a bone dry.  Bone dry, snarlings, snarlings, sex snarlings with you.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Well, now people are doing their own traffic reports for E-Rock.  The drive-thru traffic at the McDonald's has backed up. 
[01:33:00]  Thank you, Smokezilla.  If only we had a truck strong enough to drag E-Rock behind it.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  There's your pound GNX, which, by the way, you know, since we don't run the metro traffic  at this hour, it doesn't mean the traffic reports have to stop.  You know, you're on the roads.  You're our eyes and ears.  So if you see something going on, you can report it.  Oh, no.  You're our eyes and ears. 
[01:33:30]  So if you see food, tell me.  Because I'll be the stomach.  Yeah, if you see any coupons in the local paper, please bring it to my attention.  You're on the road.  You're our hands and feet.  You're our eyes and ears.  Oh, my God.  Yes, you're on.  This one wasn't scripted, but they had bullet points of key phrases.  Bullet points should have been going through your head.  Exactly.  Pull guns from paper bags.  Hollow points. 
[01:34:00]  Our bud sex-twire.  Was there a big book of cliches that you just kind of flipped through?  Oh, this is so good.  Is this the Lazlo from Long Island?  He writes, Sex Bagel, the radio nickname for a guy who loves food so much he wants to...  Sex Bagel.  You see something going on, you can report it faster pretty much than they could anyway.  So dial up pound GNX on your single wireless phone. 
[01:34:30]  Let us know what's going on.  You know, it helps everyone get home or out and about much easier.  Okay?  Cool.  Going to hit you up with some more music before she gets really pissed.  It's Puddle of Mud, She Hates Me.  On the rock station, 99.7 GNX.  Hit the pose.  Hit the pose.  Cha-cha-cha.  Everything.  Oh.  Why do DJs do that?  I wish you'd hit the post in a car.  Exactly.  And then phone pound GNX so you can tell us about it. 
[01:35:00]  It's a fat hack pileup.  Oh, Sex Bagel stinks.  Drunk driving with Papa John's grease all over the middle of the chubby fingers.  All that garlic juice.  I like garlic butter sauce.  That's all he brought us, though.  You don't have any more, E-Rock?  Oh, you have to.  The GNX stuff, that's all I got.  Well, what else you got?  I have an air check from WBLI, Long Island, two days after Christmas. 
[01:35:30]  They had nobody, and I was the overnight board op, so they made me do a couple hours.  WBLI.  Please bring it in tomorrow.  I need more of this.  Yeah.  Bring it in tomorrow.  All right.  All right.  God, E-Rock.  That is just some classically bad cliches.  Let's go to John in Jersey.  I know, Dan.  You're doing your job.  Hey.  Let it be known that Dan is doing his job. 
[01:36:00]  He's holding up his brakes on.  John, go ahead.  What's up, guys?  I got a traffic update for you.  There's a mayonnaise truck flipped over, and people are handing out bread.  We like the intent of it.  Yeah, I like that.  Which was just hurtful.  Yeah.  Tara in Jersey.  Tara.  Hi.  Good morning.  Good morning, Tara.  How are you today?  Very well, and you?  Good.  Why are you calling the show?  I wondered if I still had a shot at that $1,000, and I really like the show. 
[01:36:30]  You can't be serious, right?  I'm serious.  You played one of my favorite clips today, too.  The guy seeing you went up.  Yeah.  We gave the money away like a half hour ago.  But I didn't hear it on the air.  I've been listening and listening.  I didn't hear you hand it to anybody.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  Today's the first time I got through. 
[01:37:00]  I've been calling almost.  Are we ready for tomorrow's sound?  It's part of that air check.  No, we didn't pull it yet.  All right.  We'll tell you right after the break what tomorrow's sound is.  It's from the E-Rock air check.  Oh, please.  What was the line again for the people that might not be able to figure out?  The line?  Help them out a little bit.  But I love garlic butter sauce.  What?  I love garlic butter sauce.  All right.  But it's going to be from the air check.  We'll play the actual clip after the break.  But just to give you a little heads up with that. 
[01:37:30]  Okay.  Rob Bartlett in studio.  We got Bob Kelly coming through that door in a minute or two.  Rob's going to be playing November 10th at the Seven Angels Theater in Waterbury.  Waterbury.  Oh, Connecticut.  Connecticut.  203-757-4676 for tickets.  Or go to robshow.com.  That's it.  All right.  We'll continue with Rob Bartlett and Bob Kelly next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, I forgot to give him a plug as we were doing the E-Rock air check. 
[01:38:00]  Coke Logic did a great E-Rock animation.  It's up on ONARadio.com.  The station here in New York has kind of hired Coke Logic.  They're hiring, like, O&A fans like crazy if you want to send in a resume.  You got Stephen S. from Bayshore doing the show rundowns on ONARadio.com.  Coke Logic does, like, a video every other week or something like that in animation.  And he animated us just beating up E-Rock at his air check last week.  It's really, really good.  Check it out later on today. 
[01:38:30]  Bob Kelly in the studio.  The just-married Bob Kelly.  Yes.  How long has it been?  A week?  Two weeks now?  Two weeks.  Two weeks.  And I'm back to lonely Bob Kelly.  Why?  I don't know.  It just went away.  It was good for two weeks.  I know.  I felt like a man.  And now you realize that's not going to help your problems.  No, but neither is a new pair of headphones that I tried to fill it with yesterday.  Nothing.  I was not saying it's over.  What are you saying?  You're back to humping into the sink?  Linger Linger! 
[01:39:00]  I'm going to say it now.  For those haters out there, shut up.  Hey, your team won, though, there, Bob.  You should be happy.  I see the Boston Red Sox hat, the T-shirt.  Yes, they won.  It wasn't the same, though.  But congratulations.  What do you mean it wasn't the same?  It wasn't the same.  They're getting all jaded.  You got two goddamn victories and you think of the Yankees.  Good.  I hope the Sox win so long that it just becomes completely meaningless to you.  And they never win at home.  It's actually feeling better now seeing you angry. 
[01:39:30]  Completely meaningless.  You know, that's what it is.  It's like the Yankees are kind of, you know, crapping.  But you go through those phases so that you feel to succeed and then get to the series and stuff.  See, you guys are all like, you expect it now every year.  No, no, no, no.  Go ahead.  Start expecting it.  That's not it.  Look, you guys have been winning for 100 years.  You've had a team every once in a while that would just kill people.  We haven't won in 86 years.  My whole life we didn't win. 
[01:40:00]  And we came close to winning.  And then we finally did it.  And we did it in the fashion that we did it on the backs of Yankee fans.  And then we went four straight.  And then we did it.  And it was like, oh, my God, you can't get better than that.  It's like nothing's going to compare.  It's like dating a hot stripper and then going back to a regular chick at a bar.  It's just it's not the same thing.  It's you're not feeling greedy, greedy Boston animal.  Well, we had the Yankees beat the Braves down to nothing in 96. 
[01:40:30]  Yes.  That was the best of all of them.  Right.  That was a satisfying victory.  And, you know, it was amazing.  It was Torrey's brother was, you know, Frank was in trouble with his stupid heart.  I mean, it was a big whole thing in New York.  But after they were still victories after it were nice.  But you guys are just like, that's old hat.  Well, yeah, I think he's on to something, though.  I think there's an energy that's lost after your team wins a championship because then  you're like, now what?  Like you're excited today.  You'll be excited the next few days.  And then it's like, all right. 
[01:41:00]  Now what?  Yeah.  Now what?  Because now you're hoping for, I guess, a dynasty or something.  That was where that's stunk that you guys got blown out by Cleveland.  You know, that would have been great to beat you guys to get to the World Series.  That's what happens.  That would have been fantastic.  But you guys stink.  You miss your enemy.  The Mets stink.  Hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  I was rooting for your socks in the World Series.  I wanted you guys.  I wanted to play you guys.  Who wanted to play Colorado?  Who wanted to go to a mile high? 
[01:41:30]  I said this on the air last week.  I pride myself in knowing a little bit about sports, a little bit about all sports.  I couldn't name one player in the Rockies.  I couldn't care less about the Colorado Rockies.  They stink.  Thank you, E-Rock.  Whatever you just did.  You had to adjust your microphone for whatever reason.  Oh, wow.  He's a professional.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sex bagel.  Well, I'm excited for the Patriots now, too.  I met Tom Brady, too, last at Miami.  Really?  I've never wanted to.  When?  When?  Recently?  Yeah, I was at the Miami Gay.  At the Miami Gay. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, while he's, like, working his ass off and his chick is just sunbathing on South Beach?  Yeah.  That time?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She could care less.  She was, like, on the beach and in the water and stuff while her man was, like, throwing,  I don't know, 12 touchdown passes.  Yeah, but she dresses him now.  And have you seen how hot he looks at the post-game interviews?  I mean, he's switching it up.  Last week, he looked like a presidential candidate.  Yesterday, he looked like a GQ model with a little hat on.  I met him, and I was frozen in my tracks with his presence and his good look. 
[01:42:30]  I would kiss him.  I wouldn't even kiss him sexually.  I would kiss him, like, love.  Like, suck on his bottom lip.  Oh, my God.  And slowly pull away.  So, like, that little bit of saliva would be touching me and him at the same time.  Bobby never has a problem talking about how attracted he is to guys.  No, Tom Brady.  To certain guys.  Tom Brady.  You do that to Mr. Brady.  Greg?  Yeah.  Bobby? 
[01:43:00]  Kelly?  So, he's in your top five.  Who else is in your top five?  Oh, top five men?  Yeah.  Oh, jeez.  I think Brady would take up two.  Wow.  I would try for Brady once.  If he rejected me, I'd try again.  Yeah.  Are you a Brad Pitt fan?  Brad Pitt.  Oh, God.  You ever see his shoulders?  His rounded shoulders?  And I love that he has a little acne scars, too.  That makes him even sexier.  Yeah.  Who else is in your top five?  Oh, keep naming people.  Come on.  No, you ain't dragging me into that. 
[01:43:30]  Jerry Van Dyke.  The world of the home office.  The other one who brought up Tom...  You brought up Brad Pitt real quick.  Well, that's the go-to one.  If guys are going to talk about guys, they mention Brad Pitt.  Oh?  That's not a stretch.  Really?  I never get caught up in that.  And if I ever have to say something, I'm always like, you know, girls do seem to find  him attractive.  That's as close as I'll get.  Because sometimes it's just, you know. 
[01:44:00]  How'd you meet him?  How'd you meet Tom Brady?  Well, it's not as you'd think.  How would you think I'd meet Tom Brady?  I would think you have a wide stance when you take a crap.  And perhaps your foot was tapping.  A little tap, tap, tap.  Tapping the foot.  Yeah.  Wide stance.  How'd you meet him?  A Starbucks, something stupid, right?  No, I was at the game.  We went back in the locker room after the game.  Oh, you were hanging with Dane Cook, obviously.  Well, no.  No?  You were able to do this on your own?  No, absolutely not.  Yeah, Robert Kelly Live got me back in. 
[01:44:30]  Have you been to my website?  I have a MySpace.  No, I was with Mark Wahlberg's brother, Jimbo Wahlberg.  Oh, not Donnie.  I'm thinking, all right, Donnie Wahlberg.  But he could say Donnie.  We would know who that is.  But it's Pete Best of the Wahlberg family.  Wow, Jimbo, huh?  I tell you what, though.  That name.  Get your place.  That name just.  Oh, I meant Belichick.  Went to his back little room.  He just got out of a shower all wet, kooky-eyed.  Like, one eye's going this way, one eye's going that way. 
[01:45:00]  Who, Andy Belichick?  It's just meeting people with famous last names.  Gummo.  It was uncomfortable.  Gummo.  Gummo.  The worst was Gummo.  Eric B. from New Hampshire, he writes,  Opie just basically said dance monkey,  and dumb Bob started talking about banging dude.  I'm just being honest with you, folks.  How about those pats, though, man? 
[01:45:30]  You know that Brady set an all-time career record for himself,  touchdown passes, and the season's only half over.  Yeah.  And people thought he was a great before this year.  Yeah, he's not.  What has he got, 28, 29 already?  I think it's 30.  I think he's on pace.  He's up to 30.  I think he's on pace to do 60.  60 touchdowns.  To do 60.  And the record is 48, I think?  48, yeah, by Peyton.  By Peyton Manning.  Yeah.  And then you got the big game this Sunday.  You got the pats playing the Colts at home.  Yeah, Super Bowl 41 and a half.  This should be the Super Bowl.  Screw the actual Super Bowl at the end of the year. 
[01:46:00]  This is the game.  Yeah, this is going to be a big game.  This is going to get massive ratings.  And it's never been done.  No two teams have ever done this.  Undefeated this late in the season?  Nope.  The last time it happened, both those teams got defeated the week before.  Oh, really?  Yep.  So now this is going to be, the pats are going to beat the Colts.  You got to go pats on this one.  I think Belichick, what happened was he got accused of cheating.  And then he was like, okay, okay, now I'm going to stick it to every team from now on. 
[01:46:30]  I'm going to just bury every team that we play.  And show we don't need no stinking tapes.  Show that these tapes work.  All the backlog tapes that I have.  Yeah, he still has them.  I don't need to do it.  What kind of points are we talking in a game like that?  I think the Patriots are actually favored.  Are they?  It's got to be by nothing, though.  Yeah, by nothing.  Even though the pats are away.  By the way, this is a great opportunity to say the football picks sponsored by Dish Network.  I went, well, my brother did the picks once again.  And I went six for seven. 
[01:47:00]  I'm tied for first this week with Derek.  We're going to decide that tonight.  So your brother went six for seven.  Oh, yeah.  I have nothing to do with it.  Elmo Spears?  Elmo Spears.  Link in me!  Brother Elmo on MySpace if you want to see him as Britney Spears.  Yeah, Dish Network.  It's time to get more TV from your TV.  Sign up for Dish Network today.  Yeah, I went six for seven.  But this week, Ant's going to do the football picks.  And he's got a great strategy. 
[01:47:30]  Why don't we start with the pats and the colts, Anthony?  Using your strategy.  You're going with the names of the teams.  Yes, I figured just the names of the teams and what they represent, you should be able  to determine who's going to win.  So we're looking at Patriots.  Guys in three-quarter hats.  A Patriot.  Three-quarter hats.  Goofy hat, though.  Goofy hat.  Musket.  Doesn't matter, though.  And a musket.  I mean, Patriot sounds really cool.  But let's remember, goofy triangle hat and a musket. 
[01:48:00]  Where you can shoot one time every 20 minutes.  And then shoes with buckles.  Yeah, but muskets.  I've seen a lot of muskets take down a lot of colts.  You're going to have to shoot the colt more than once with a musket.  That could take a long time.  In the Civil War, or even in the Revolutionary War, let's say, since that's the Patriot.  In World War II.  Which side were the Patriots on?  Let's see what it was.  In the Revolutionary War, I would say many a musket took down many a colt. 
[01:48:30]  The only shot the colt has is horse gag and that video from Seattle.  That's the only shot the horse has.  So you've got to go with the Patriots.  Yeah, but while the dumb patriot is like getting his musket ready, which is the same motion you do to take care of yourself.  He gets trampled to death.  The colt could kick him in the head.  I'm not saying a Patriot has never died from a wound inflicted on him by a colt, but the majority, I'm sure, more colts have been victim of Patriots musket fire than Colts hitting the Patriot. 
[01:49:00]  Burton Philly reminding us that Paul Revere did ride a wild colt, and because of that, he's saying Pats win this game.  Pats win.  Pats win based on that.  That's my pick.  So a Patriot beats a colt every time.  Right.  Patriots over the colt.  Colts.  You don't see horses by the family being driven around by people, do you?  Being pulled through Central Park.  The horses are slaves. 
[01:49:30]  Exactly.  They're fun to just abuse and make glue out of and we're done with them.  So based on just what their names are.  One musket shot, though, is going to just piss off the colts.  Nah.  He's going to have a fight.  Down.  Well, it's one colt if it's colts plural.  Colts.  Yeah, but if it's Patriots, plural, now you've got a nice firing line.  Fire!  While the other ones are reloading.  Fire!  Camping down the blunderbuss.  All right, hold on.  Fire!  Hold on.  Before you make your official decision, you've got the Patriots. 
[01:50:00]  Do they have the wacky drum guy?  Yeah, you've got to have the wacky drum guy and the flag.  How is he going to take on a colt with his dumb drum?  He doesn't need to.  He's just showing how they kick ass.  Yeah?  They kick ass.  And the colts, what are they going to do?  Especially at range.  You just walk up to them later, they're all dead.  You shot them from frigging 100 yards away.  It's done.  Colts over, or Patriots over Colts.  Oh, Patriots over Colts.  Patriots over Colts.  All right, we'll have the rest of your picks later on this week.  Of course.  Thank you, DirecTV. 
[01:50:30]  Hey, here's the sound for tomorrow if you want to win $1,000.  You're listening for this sound between 7 and 7.30.  Here it is.  I love the garlic butter sauce.  Sauce.  Sauce.  Not even sauce.  Sauce.  Yeah.  I love the garlic butter sauce.  Sauce.  Hold on.  What a puker.  Here it is again.  I love the garlic butter sauce.  Sauce.  A garlic butter saw. 
[01:51:00]  Or garlic butter sod.  Sod.  It also sounds like.  Probably would taste better.  One.  That awful stuff.  Papa John's pizza with butter and garlic sauce.  That's wonderfully healthy.  Wow.  Yeah, by the way, good point.  Tom in Chicago, listening to us for the last time on WCKJ.  Yes, Tom.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Last time?  What are you talking about last time?  Get ready for Espanola.  Mira la cosa que tenis on my head aquí. 
[01:51:30]  You better be asking me, man.  I'm from New York originally.  I've been listening to you guys since WNEW days.  Just remember, there's still lots of different ways to listen to the O.P. and Anthony show.  Now, Tom, what do you got for the show today?  I will.  Jimmy throws the towel with the whole accent thing.  I'll go that way if I have to.  God forbid.  But I want you guys syndicated on the radio.  Yeah, I kind of want to be on a station in Chicago.  That's for sure.  What do you got, Tom?  I'm out here to put this Steve Dahl character.  The station you guys are on here, no disrespect sucks.  Well, Steve Dahl's moving to the station that's doing Jack, right? 
[01:52:00]  I'm out of Canada because the station sucks in Chicago.  All right, Tom.  What do you got?  I'm sorry, O.P.  It's all right.  Just what he was saying and how his strategy of picking teams based upon the mascots.  Yeah.  How the Colts and the Patriots.  So you're saying, Anthony, a buffalo beat a jet yesterday?  Have you had the size of two mascots?  Yes.  Buffaloes can absolutely beat a jet.  Yes.  I can.  Can I? 
[01:52:30]  How is a jet going to beat a buffalo without crashing?  Exactly.  And then the jet dies.  It crashes.  And buffalo can tear apart a jet on the open prairie.  The buffalo.  Wait, wait, wait.  Who was home?  Who was home?  Ah, the jets.  The jets.  My brother.  So let's see.  It's at an airport.  My brother picked that.  You're right.  My brother picked the bills over the jets.  Dude, birds take down planes.  Yeah.  So you'd have to, you'd have to, you know, the buffaloes.  Could you see a buffalo getting sucked in a 747 engine? 
[01:53:00]  That plane's going down, baby.  How about on the runway if it just runs over the buffalo's big stupid body?  It's probably going to get, you know, a herd of buffalo.  You got to line up that buffalo.  You ever see a buffalo, like, maneuver on an open plane?  But how's the buffalo going to get through the metal detector?  He doesn't have metal on him.  But the, I mean, the size of him, it's just, you can't, oh, he's not going to fit.  He's not going to fit.  He'll have to be padded down.  Okay.  He's going to have to go around and get padded down.  Buffaloes are queer.  Yeah, but a jet has a rocket. 
[01:53:30]  A rocket?  Yeah.  It's called a jet engine.  No, rockets that you shoot.  You're talking about, like, a jet jet?  Oh, a military jet.  Yeah.  No, the jets aren't based out of, out of, out of, you think they're based on commercial  airlines?  Of course they are.  Look at their helmets.  They were named in LaGuardia Airport.  Dude, they used to play at Shea Stadium.  Yeah, what a crappy logo.  They had a reworked logo, but back in the day, it was obviously a commuter jet.  They used to play at Shea.  They didn't even pick a military jet?  No. 
[01:54:00]  Like a TWA passenger jet with propellers?  New York Air Force.  Propellers, jets.  I got to jump in.  I just want to make it perfectly clear.  Yes, sir.  The football picks are sponsored by Dish Network.  Yes.  It's time to get more TV from your TV.  Sign up for Dish Network today.  All right, we got to take a break.  We got Rob Bartlett.  We got Bob Kelly.  Bob, you promoting anything?  Yeah, I'm going to be at Uncle Vinny's this Friday and Saturday the 2nd and the 3rd.  Yeah.  Guess where I'll be.  You going to be in Jersey?  No, way north. 
[01:54:30]  We can do alternate plus because I'll be way north in Queensbury.  No.  Queensbury.  No, no.  Oh, yeah.  Upstate New York.  No.  Vinny Marks Club?  Queens.  Queensbury.  Queensbury.  I'll be in Queensbury.  No, I'm doing teeny comedy clubs to do my new hour.  Sweet Basil Restaurant.  It's Vinny Marks' place.  Oh, is it?  Oh, Vinny Marks.  Yeah.  Okay.  You're doing Sweet Basil's Restaurant?  Yes.  Teeny places.  And you're doing Uncle Vinny's.  Uncle Vinny's.  Huh?  Over in Dover.  Some of us are doing theaters, even though we don't have a, you know, place to promote.  You know what I'm saying? 
[01:55:00]  It's a theater.  It's such a theater.  You're doing tiny places.  It's a theater.  Well, but it's a theater.  That's my point.  It's a theater.  But I like doing the smaller comedy.  I like doing the restaurants because you just have a fun eating atmosphere.  You get a free meal, too, which is also great.  Nice.  I should be shot.  I really should be.  You've got an HBO special, a DVD, a best-selling book, and you're in an Italian restaurant.  I'm trying to work.  I got the new hour I'm working on, so I have to work it out.  I work it out.  Do you have to go with bigger people on a bigger ticket?  What are you, nuts?  I like small little rooms. 
[01:55:30]  Do you have to promote the special?  No.  No?  No.  No, it's over.  Let's take a break because you're just babbling now.  Yeah.  That's good.  Sometimes you win.  Sometimes you lose.  All right, and we've got to get to the home invasion.  Blind guy shot a home intruder in the neck.  We'll have that story for Anthony next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Rock and roll. 
[01:56:00]  Full studio today.  Opie and Anthony.  Once again, congratulations to the Red Sox.  People are finally waking up in Boston.  In their own vomit.  They slept in.  No showers today for a lot of people.  They're all waking up like Bon Scott.  We had the car service that took us from the hotel to the Hard Rock for the Halloween party  up in Boston with WBCN.  I want to thank everybody up there.  That was really a great time, and WBCN took care of us. 
[01:56:30]  That was very cool.  But the car service obviously had been used the night before.  Probably had every car service in Boston been used to transport people from Fenway to various  bars, locations, and maybe their homes, whatever.  And nothing but the smell of vomit and crumbs and booze spilt in there.  Like, the guy didn't even really clean the limo up. 
[01:57:00]  Or he did as best he could.  He probably didn't have time.  Did you see the last one we were in?  And there's a little foot thing, a foot thing for my foot, a foot thing that you stand on  when you're getting in and out.  And that was covered in vomit.  Oh, really?  Like, someone had opened the door to boof out that door, and it just hit that foot thing.  And the crevices probably.  Yeah, yeah.  And all the little crevices.  Sure.  Pavement chowder.  Yep.  Yeah.  Pavement chowder. 
[01:57:30]  That was some pavement chowder.  What is that?  New England?  Manhattan?  The white choice.  Hey, I'm going to try a little something here.  Rob Bartlett in the studio, Bob Kelly in the studio.  Just want to try something here, see if this works.  It might not.  Who knows?  Let me just try it.  Got you.  Welcome, everyone, to Monday Night Raw!  Oh, no.  Manhattan's here on this command.  Wow.  Now with the macho red, Randy Savage, Bobby Heaton's on the outside.  Who's on the inside? 
[01:58:00]  Rob Bartlett.  Oh, God.  And tonight, live in London, the great matchup, you'll see the state players in tag team action.  Caught a very special interview with Razor Ramon.  Razor Ramon.  They have a great matchup.  You're talking with sex bagel here.  Oh, my God.  What was that?  What was that?  Beware versus Yokozuma.  You know, the guy's got the soccer thing going right up there in the middle between the dead man's land and no man's land.  Watch out! 
[01:58:30]  Hey, Mr. Bartlett said that about Yokozuma.  That's all I can think about right now.  But also...  I hope that sound is a UFO ready to take you off the planet.  Oh, God.  What was that?  At that point, I was hoping.  You were announcing a wrestling thing with Vince?  Yeah, not quite enough sound effects.  One of the first hosts of Monday Night Raw for the first 13 weeks.  1992, right?  Then you got fired!  Yeah!  I did the first 13 weeks.  In week 12, Vince was getting some kind of an award, some humanitarian award. 
[01:59:00]  And I did him.  I wore his tuxedo.  They put the big things in their shoulders.  The makeup person did all the makeup on.  And I did him.  I did the whole night.  I just went.  I don't know.  I didn't get it.  And the next week, Vince went, very funny.  Very funny.  I think we're going to do some stuff outside.  You know, we're going to do some pre-production with you.  You're not going to be live.  Oh.  Who took your place? 
[01:59:30]  I'm trying to remember who it was.  Oh, the guy, the king.  Jerry the King Lawler.  Oh, Jerry the King Lawler.  Jerry the King Lawler.  Oh, my God, King!  Yeah.  That was his name.  Yeah, the other guy there.  That gets the...  Hey, you know it.  The Bell's palsy.  The J.R.  J.R. gets the Bell's palsy.  J.R.  I got Bell's palsy.  Oh, my God, King!  All right, he can't...  Half my face is dripping down on my shoulder.  Yoko should spend a little less time at the sushi bar, a little more time in the salad bar,  Vince. 
[02:00:00]  Well, we'll see about that.  Oh, my God.  Can I tell...  Well, we'll see about that.  I got a great observation.  Hey, Vince!  Great observation.  Rob Bartlett is a very funny guy, but Vince hates you, and there's absolutely no chemistry.  He's like, yeah.  Yeah, I just...  This was the wrong...  You can just tell.  It was the weirdest thing, because I had done this.  It has nothing to do with you.  It's very obvious.  Listen again. 
[02:00:30]  Yoko should spend a little less time at the sushi bar, a little more time in the salad  bar, Vince.  Well, we'll see about that.  All that way Yoko and Zuna use his sushi.  We'll see about that.  And the macho man said he has thus far not even been knocked off his feet.  Much less undefeated.  He hasn't seen his feet quite some time.  That's a good point as well.  That's a good point as well.  He hasn't seen his feet, meaning he's fat.  You know, make fun of everything.  You make fun of everything.  And the minute you start to make fun of everything, well, it's wrestling. 
[02:01:00]  You can't make fun of wrestling.  What do you think you're doing?  What in the hell do you think you're doing?  You think you're funny.  You're trying to be funny.  We want you to be funny, but don't be funny.  I don't enjoy it, baby.  You got some nerve coming on my show and trying to be funny.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:01:30]  You want to do fat jokes, Rob?  Come on.  Those are fat jokes.  That's right.  Those are fat jokes.  Yokozuna just did a new movie around his waist in 80 days.  Fantastic.  Let's go.  I'll move on.  Yokozuna wakes up every morning and has a sheet cake for breakfast.  Enough about Yokozuna.  We get it.  He's fat.  People saying Yokozuna is sitting on the couch behind us. 
[02:02:00]  They're looking on Paltuck.  No, that's Robert Kelly.  That's Robert Kelly.  A little confusion out there.  Oh, wow.  I thought that was the tape.  I know.  It does that one to a T.  That's one of my things.  Take a look.  505 pounds.  I wasn't that heavy.  Yokozuna.  That's one big butt and a** this.  Oh, jeez.  You dropped the N-bomb, didn't you? 
[02:02:30]  No?  Oh, you got to dump out the...  Oh, boy.  What?  Oh, the racial...  What?  Oh, boy.  What got beeped?  The O-word.  That was back in the day before it was really a...  Wait a minute.  The O-word.  Oh, where they...  But the O-word is for stuff.  Not people.  Yeah, or oriental.  They beeped the word oriental?  Yeah.  Yeah, oriental is things.  It's things. 
[02:03:00]  Asian or people.  Yeah.  They beeped the word oriental.  So you could have been talking about his shorts.  I learned my lesson.  Yes, yes.  Who beeped it?  Danny decided that.  We couldn't hear this.  Well, I had asked.  I was told that it happened.  Is that hysterical?  Of course it is.  That is something that happened on wrestling years ago.  It's not really...  It's a nostalgic look back.  It is.  It's just...  Faulting.  That is something.  Bunch of cowards.  Anyway. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, thanks.  Oh, man.  That's one big butt of a...  Vince.  And then Vince is just like...  He hated me.  He hated me.  Oh, you can...  Well, you can kind of hear it.  Well, what happened was this.  I had done some charity event for Special Olympics.  And he was in the audience.  And he was wearing a peach-colored velour suit.  And I did 20 minutes just on his suit.  And didn't do any material, just 20 minutes on his suit. 
[02:04:00]  And it was such a big hit.  You know, all of a sudden, a couple days later, I got this call.  How would you like to come on and be a commentator on a new live show?  Live show.  Live show.  That was great.  You know, I saw you work with those retards.  And I'd like you to come and work with my retards.  Come on.  You ought to work with my retards.  Hello.  That's what E-Rock's waiting for.  Sex Bagel. 
[02:04:30]  How would you like to come and work for me?  Sex Bagel.  Sex Bagel.  Give you all the garlic saw you could eat.  Another movie series.  Garlic Saw.  Garlic Saw.  Saw 5 Garlic Saw.  Where E-Rock, as Sex Bagel, has to chew through his own body to get out of the cuffs.  And he doesn't mind because he tastes delicious to him. 
[02:05:00]  Let's hear the rest of the Rob Barley clip.  Commenting about Yokozum.  Oh, God.  That's one big butt of a bitch, Vince.  Uh, in a matter of speaking, yeah.  It's in a matter of speaking.  He's got an ass like an amphitheater.  Woo!  I heard that.  Woo!  Woo!  Step into a Slim Jim.  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  No, you didn't.  No, you didn't.  Another fat joke, Rob. 
[02:05:30]  Well, it was Yokozum.  What's the amphitheater?  550 pounds.  I knew nothing about wrestling.  I had, you know.  I'm making fun, but I do have to say, I would watch Vince, Macho Man, and Rob Barley.  Oh, hell yeah.  Dude, it looks so awkward.  Just Vince going, yeah, well, in a matter of speaking.  In a matter of speaking, but not like that.  Jesus.  This guy, I mean, fat jokes, what the hell is going on here?  Vince, explain that one to me.  I didn't get it. 
[02:06:00]  I didn't get what he meant by amplifier.  No amphitheater, dummy.  Yeah.  Ooh, yeah.  He's got an ass like an amphitheater.  Woo!  I heard that.  I heard that.  It's Monday Night Live, folks.  It's uncooked.  Uncut.  And uncensored.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, did you say ass?  Oh.  I like that, Rob.  Oh, man.  I've been on the internet. 
[02:06:30]  I was voted one of the top ten worst wrestling announcers in history.  Wow.  Yep.  I wear that mantle proudly.  Uncut and uncensored.  So you could say, f*** him in the f***, even if he's a f***ing f***er.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Snap into a f***ing Slim Jim.  You f*** it.  Live and uncensored. 
[02:07:00]  Censored.  No, you didn't.  I'll be at the Walmart opening on Thursday.  In a matter of speaking.  In a matter of speaking.  In a matter of speaking.  What does that even mean?  Oh, I'm just saying, you know, after the show, it was like one of those where it was  really, really tense, you know.  Oh, I bet.  Oh, just awful.  Just awful.  Or before the show, you know, just there at the city center, just, you know, after the  first week, it was just like.  That look was.  I thought it was a good idea at the time. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, all uncomfortable.  Yeah.  Been there, man.  Oof.  Oh, man.  I couldn't buy enough pies.  Linger Lunger.  Vince has a knack for picking radio guys that aren't going to work out.  Linger Lunger.  What do you mean?  XFL?  Oh, yeah.  Don't make us bring in our XFL tapes.  Linger Lunger.  My favorite was the one where you guys did the live event from the Hard Rock when it 
[02:08:00]  was still, well, it was before it was the Hard Rock when it was still the WWE restaurant.  Yep, yep.  And, you know, you were like peeking in.  You were like the man on the, you were peeking in the dressing room and watching some fight  with some of that.  Oh, good God.  And they were on stage.  Oh, yeah.  It was like all the tests were there.  And they actually, you were going to break and Opie did the raise the roof thing.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Really?  Yes, you did.  Yes, you did.  Dude, you raised the roof. 
[02:08:30]  He raised the roof.  All right, we'll bring those tapes.  Isn't that around when I was starting to come on the show?  I don't think I was a full-  Unfortunately, you couldn't join in that debacle.  Oh, no, no.  But I kind of remember being there and just being happy that I was on the show, that all  this stuff was happening on.  You and Florentine were doing like time to warm up the audience.  Florentine was warming up the audience, helping us out with that.  Getting them all pumped up.  And I remember thinking like, wow, this is really cool that all this stuff is happening.  This stinks.  This stinks.  What was the name of the guy that was trying to make into a big star on XFL? 
[02:09:00]  He hate me?  He hate me.  Oh, yeah.  But then he had a brother, too.  He hate me, too.  He had the same thing on the back of my head.  Oh, really?  He hate me, also.  He hate me, too.  Can we get a Vince ID before we get out of here?  This is Vince McMahon of the WWF.  And if you love a good cage match, you're going to love Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  That's it?  In a matter of speaking. 
[02:09:30]  In a matter of speaking.  Let's squeeze this in.  Blind man shoots home intruder in neck.  Gainesville, Florida.  Anthony loves these home invaders.  A Gainesville man's lack of sight didn't stop him from defending his home from an intruder.  According to police.  Wow.  Wow.  Savon Curtis Jr., 28, broke into Arthur Miller Williams' house.  Wait.  Arthur Williams' house?  Williams' house.  Arthur Williams' house in Gainesville at around 3 a.m. 
[02:10:00]  Curtis' police said knocked on the door, asked to be let inside, but Williams refused.  Curtis then tried to force his way into the home.  The 75-year-old retired taxi dispatcher, who's been legally blind for the past 61 years,  opened fire on the would-be thief who kicked down his door, police said.  Police said Williams shot Curtis, who tried to flee, but collapsed on the front porch in  the left side of the neck.  There you go.  Blind guy.  Just started firing a gun on a sit-and-spin.  That's about the only way I can figure it pan out for a blind guy. 
[02:10:30]  No, I'll tell you, this is how stupid the crook was.  He's trying to break in, so he's making a loud noise at the one place the blind guy can  identify without looking, the door.  Right, right.  This place is true.  Kick!  Kick!  Kick!  Right about there.  I know where the door is.  I walk in and out of it.  When you throw a brick through the window first, a little diversion.  A little diversion.  Guy knows nothing about diversionary tactics.  Absolutely.  Turn a radio on or something.  I must have been surprised.  Guess I'll leave through the back door. 
[02:11:00]  Crooks must hate crooks.  What is this, 1940?  Crooks must hate when a lousy screw gets the drop on them.  Most mugs.  But they must hate like that instant they get shot and just go, oh, man.  I could have had a minute.  Yeah.  You think they're saying that?  They talk it out like Gans.  I got shot!  Got shot!  Ah!  Top of the world, Ma!  You shot me! 
[02:11:30]  Nice gun.  The greatest was in Kiss of Death when Victor Mature tells the cops, now pull up in a couple  of minutes.  And when they do, he gets himself shot.  So as the cops are pulling up, they see Richard Widmark shooting him.  And then they get him on gun charges.  He gives up his body to arrest the guy.  Or you get him shot.  That's a stupid movie.  That's love.  It was so 50s or 40s.  Yeah.  We have to leave this side.  No!  Yeah, we do.  Tomorrow's sound.  Between 7 and 7.30, we're going to play this.  I love the garlic butter song. 
[02:12:00]  Saw.  Saw.  When you hear that tomorrow, between 7 and 7.30, if you're the 10th caller at 877-212-ONDA,  you will win the $1,000.  That sound will be up on onaradio.com.

[02:12:30]  Are they nice, Vinny and his wife?  No.  Adorable.  No.  Really sweet.  And, you know, if you talk nice, a little three-way action.  Oh, cool.  Yeah.  And Bob Kelly, is it what?  Uncle Vinny's?  Uncle Vinny's.  Uncle Vinny's.  Friday and Saturday.  877-UNCLE-VIN.  And robertkellylive.com or on MySpace.  And Comedy Central special.  When is that out?  It's coming out after Christmas.  After Christmas?  Why do we have to wait so long?  We're putting it on the new CD.  Yeah?  Yeah, I don't know.  Comedy Central takes forever to do them. 
[02:13:00]  You did great, man.  I was in the audience.  That special is going to kill.  Oh, thanks.  Yeah, that was good.  All right.  Good time.  Well, it was a good time.  What kind of pat answer was that?  I had fun.  I got uncomfortable.  Good time.  Good time.  I don't know why.  Let people love you and come with your friends.  By the way, I love you a la caja de su madre.  Linger a little longer.  Linger longer.  We might be saying goodbye to Chicago today.  Chicago.  We'll see you again, I guess.  I don't know.  This business. 
[02:13:30]  You guys are getting kicked off?  We'll see.  You'll love it.  What the hell's happening?  It's a new tour.  But this time around, it's not right.  I mean, they're going Spanish, you know.  So it's not a kick in the teeth like YSP was.  This is a weird one.  Well, they're only going Spanish from 6 to 9 a.m.  Yeah.  Oh, swim walk.  All right.  There was some.  Oh, congratulations to your Red Sox there, Bobby.  All right.  Thank you.  That's you and your wife. 
[02:14:00]  And to my wife.  Yes.  My new wife.  And now it's all about the Pats.  Go Pats.  Go.  Go Patriots.  Go.  All right.  Huge win.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  In a manner of speaking.  This is the O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[02:14:30]  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  On XM 202.  I'm firing.  Dummies.  Chak-a-tat.  They dumped Oriental?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They fucking dumped it.  They dumped Oriental.  And the context in which they dumped it was so weird.  I was just describing the difference between Oriental and Asian. 
[02:15:00]  Because we were listening to an old WWF tape that included the multi-talented Rob Bartlett  from many years ago.  Many years ago.  And he said something about someone having a fat ass and then added the Oriental tag on  it.  Oriental, though, now is like furniture and rugs and Asians are people.  And I was saying that and they actually dumped out of Oriental. 
[02:15:30]  How is that?  Why would they?  But I...  And then Tracy was waiting for me outside.  She's like, if that's true about Chicago, changing formats and going Spanish, I hope  you're not going to spend the whole show tomorrow raging about that.  I'm like, do you understand the difference between the Philly situation and the Chicago  situation?  Are you paying attention at all?  The Philly situation and the Chicago situation.  We need to really have to sit down with the...  How did it come to this?  I won't have it still to the children.  That's an infamnia. 
[02:16:00]  And how about what Tracy worries about is them dumping out of the word Oriental.  Go yell and scream about them dumping out of Oriental and don't worry about how we  handle us getting dropped from Chicago.  And how about you worry about the fact that you want us to do a guy's talk show and meanwhile  you fucking hand us dresses and cut our balls off and say, here you go, sissies.  I don't mind the dresses, but ow.  Me neither.  All the balls being cut off, but combine them and it's shit.  A bunch of cuckolds while dark men fuck our wives.  We're just sitting there applauding. 
[02:16:30]  Cuckolds.  Stupid cuckolds.  I hate that word.  Cuckolds.  Cuckolds.  I love it.  I hate it.  I love when Jimmy says it.  Cuckold.  That's just fucking mind-boggling.  Picture some poor bastard sitting there shaking as his wife is just being pounded better than  she ever could be by that poor slob.  When unfunny people get mixed up and try to tell funny people how to be funny, it always  fucking stinks.  Wait a minute.  Unfunny people get mixed up with funny people.  With funny people.  And trying to tell funny people how to be funny, it always stinks. 
[02:17:00]  No one funny is ever in charge.  Which guy's the funny one?  Tom.  I'm trying to figure out.  You understand?  It's never.  There's never funny people in front of things.  Ever.  Because they wouldn't be doing that if they were funny.  No.  They went to school and got law degrees.  Sorry, but Whitney is only in the 10th grade and says she meets guys on the internet to have  sex.  Wow.  Look at this.  Look at the set of tits on her.  Look at this thing.  She ain't done.  You don't know me.  Oh, she must have just said Oriental. 
[02:17:30]  Is this the way you want to watch it?  You just picture Cartman every time now.  Look at the South Park episode where Cartman was the hot chick on one of these shows.  When your mom died.  When your mom died.  Okay?  Yep.  Your aunt took care of you.  Been taking care of you ever since.  Why do you turn on her like that?  Because she gets on my damn nerves.  I don't care.  You don't care.  No, I don't care.  You knew that actually.  Oh, that's going to sound good.  She did.  She really wants to disappoint Daddy.  She sure does.  Telling the truth exactly.  And that's why, because you're a selfish little thing. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, I do it.  Little thing.  Little thing.  I thought you were going to call her a slut.  Exactly.  Maury loves parading 14-year-old girls out in scantily, uh, all scantily clad.  Y'all okay.  Y'all okay.  I care about me.  You don't care about anybody.  I care about me.  Because y'all can't get this.  Yeah, that's right.  I don't care about me.  You'll have fucking.  Hello.  Why don't you sit down over there and have some lemonade?  Jesus.  You thought you were here to meet a young ligger.  Yeah. 
[02:18:30]  On the internet.  It's Sam Jackson.  You're going to chamber to a radiator.  God, we've got a dog shit film.  You should be shot for that.  It didn't turn you on?  No.  To be chained, would've.  She's got cellulite on her ass.  At 14?  Back dumper.  Jesus.  I'll leave the audience just loves it.  What's with the beeps?  I sure do.  How many?  More than 100.  Wait, she's...  She fuck more than 100 guys?  I like to beat up on people.  I sure do. 
[02:19:00]  Beat up?  What?  And I wish somebody out here would step up to me.  I wish somebody out here would step up to me.  Oh.  I'll be Ali out there.  I'll be Ali out there.  Yeah.  The whole crowd attacked her.  I know.  That would be great.  What, the security guys fucking gave her a good teabagging?  David Copperfield takes her to Rape Island.  Exactly.  On his little boat.  Did you make that shitty assimilating accent disappear?  I know.  This chick's going to have to retire by 15, man.  That body's not going to be kind to her in another year or two. 
[02:19:30]  She'll have a cunt lip in each sock.  Cleared this guy.  Cleared this guy.  Cleared this guy.  Cleared this guy.  Cleared this place.  She has a barrel chest like the first Superman.  She really does.  George Reeves?  Yeah.  Is that a George Reeves reference?  It certainly is.  She should end up the same way as he did.  Well, that's what Maury's doing today.  That's great.  Maury, I got young girls on.  Naked.  What does Opinette 3 have?  Instead of Lex Luthor, she's got Lex Steele firing at her face. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, shit.  Swim walk.  Swim walk.  Oh, shit.  Hey, where's the penis story, man?  We couldn't do the penis story.  I'm going to sex it up a little bit.  All righty.  No.  Yes.  How could you mistake the penis story?  Are there two?  Yes.  What?  I'm almost positive.  Oh, shit.  How many of these mouth-watering stories are there?  Oh, no, you didn't.  Oh, no, you didn't.  Uh-uh.  I wish you would step up to me.  You just want this. 
[02:20:30]  You just want this.  You're so stupid.  Hey, could you get the Carmen clip?  And she has that from South Park when he did the mocking this shit.  The shiny.  What do they put in their hair to make it like that?  The white house.  Cameron Diaz, dude.  No, the fucking...  It makes their hair look wet all the time.  White homegirls do it.  Squalene?  Is that what that is?  I don't know.  Squalene.  Squalene.  Sex for a double cheeseburger.  Nice.  Oh, man. 
[02:21:00]  I've done that.  You get hungry.  What are you going to do?  Here's the taste of the...  I've had sex with a double cheeseburger.  How great is that?  You pull your dick out and you never explain to your chick while it smells like that.  There's lettuce and you just suck it.  Quiet.  What?  Parents are a sesame seed.  Diddly, diddly, diddly, diddly, diddly, diddly, diddly.  News of cock.  Yes, the cock news.  You know why I didn't know this was a story?  Because listen to this headline.  Parents say they complained about White weeks before arrest. 
[02:21:30]  I thought it was White's in general or whatever, but it's a guy named White.  Yeah, of course.  All right.  Okay.  Parents of two children concerned about a game that teacher John White was playing with  their children had told Urbana school district officials their concern several weeks before  a criminal investigation into his conduct began.  So they were complaining ahead of time.  Those parents testified Thursday in pretrial motions in the case against White, 26, accused  of sexually molesting their daughters and seven others at Thomas Paine Elementary School. 
[02:22:00]  Nice.  At Ass Paine Elementary School.  White was playing the tasting game.  The mother said she picked up her seven-year-old daughter from aftercare at the school on November  2nd and immediately noticed that her child was wearing red rubber fingernails.  She said, we got to play the taste testing game today and I won a prize.  Oh, no.  The mother recounted of the conversation she had with her daughter as they drove home. 
[02:22:30]  The mother said she had heard her daughter mention the tasting game about three to six  times before that day.  Never question what the tasting game was three to six times before or whatever the fuck.  But hadn't talked with her about it.  What she learned from her daughter is that the game took place in White's classroom after  school, sometimes with her alone and sometimes with other girls present.  It involved White putting toppings on a banana and having the girls taste the banana to identify  the toppings.  I bet that's how it started.  Okay.  When she asked her daughter if she ever saw the banana, her daughter replied, no, silly. 
[02:23:00]  We always have blindfolds on.  Oh, silly.  Don't be silly.  Holy shit.  This guy is a douche.  The woman said after her daughter described the second game, White played with the girls  and demonstrated how he put his hand on the back of the girls' heads while they bobbed  their heads.  This cannot fucking be real. 
[02:23:30]  The mother finally became alarmed at that point.  Finally?  At that point?  At that point?  The blindfolding fucking banana licking?  Well, it was when the back of the girl's head was, you know, pushed.  That's when she was like, all right, something's up here.  I tried to keep the conversation as casual as possible so she wouldn't see or hear the  panic going through me, she said.  Blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Another mother testified that she learned of her daughter's participation in the tasting  game as the two of them ate dinner at a fast food restaurant over the school break in December. 
[02:24:00]  After hearing many of the same details described by the other woman and seeing her daughter  demonstrate how White held the banana and put a hand on the girl's head, she told her daughter  it wasn't appropriate and not to do it ever again.  It's amazing how, like, the father's fucking seven-year-old girls, like, I guess you can't,  but how does a father not just show up with a bat?  Just kill the guy, yeah.  Like, how do you keep that rage inside you?  Oh, man.  Scumbag.  She got candy for doing the test, the mother said, adding that White also had her daughter 
[02:24:30]  go to his room to clean.  Hmm.  Not that these are the brightest kids.  I guess at seven you don't know.  You don't know at seven.  And the parents are the ones that, like, if there is the tasting game in school, you  gotta ask, well, what is that?  Well, doesn't every parent start, when they first see their child, go, so what'd you do  in school today?  Yeah, and they would go, well, the tasting game.  And you go, oh, that sounds like fun.  And you just drive and go, okay, that's great.  And you're on the cell phone with your stupid yenta friends, not thinking about what the 
[02:25:00]  fucking tasting game could be?  Did you ever see the banana?  That's something.  What do you taste?  What is toppings?  Um, bleach.  And foot.  The cream topping never seems to go away.  Well, there's a game Bob Barker wished he was the host for.  The all-new tasting game.  70-year-old girl, come on down. 
[02:25:30]  The mountain climber on his penis.  This is something we call Plinko.  Plinko, yeah.  Yeah.  We're going to be right back with the tasting game, so don't go anywhere.  The tasting game.  That is really, um, I can just picture the guy picking up those, those toppings, all shaking  and all frozen sex stuff.  I can't believe we're going to get away with this.  All right, I need some sprinkles.  I came up with the perfect scheme. 
[02:26:00]  Butterscotch.  Ah, the chocolate chips.  I'll give a...  And never, like, one of the, you know, don't say anything.  That seems to be something you, you would be like, well, don't, don't say anything.  We'll have to stop doing the tasting game.  Well, they don't know what they're tasting.  They just, they could be his thumb.  You know, they don't know it's on his penis.  They had a blindfold on, right?  They thought it was a banana.  They thought it was a banana?  Yeah.  That's a penis bump.  Until someone said, dude, this is your cock.  I get it, Ope.  Not stupid. 
[02:26:30]  Let's say hi to Brian in Illinois.  He lives in the town from this story.  He might have some more to...  Brian White, hello.  To offer.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Yeah, this guy, this is the second school district in Illinois this guy worked at.  He did it at another school.  And they finally caught him.  So then he moved to this town.  And, yeah, they hired him again.  He'd been doing it for months and months.  He's finally going through the court system.  But, yeah, he's going to get a man to him.  He did it to a bunch of kids.  Good. 
[02:27:00]  So I just wanted to comment if that contributed anything to the show.  Yeah.  I mean, I didn't realize it was the second school district.  By the way, Shane from Dallas in a car.  I have a six-year-old girl.  I would murder this sick fuck.  Absolutely.  You'd have to kill a guy.  You got to be careful, though, because that guy in jail now,  who, like I said, is two years old, is so young to communicate anything.  But she, like, thought that the neighbor molested her or she told the mother something.  Oh, yeah.  So this guy goes next door and just stabs the neighbor to death. 
[02:27:30]  And it turns out the kid was wrong.  The girl said he comes over when the stars come out.  That's all she said.  She goes, the neighbor, whatever his name is or was, said, yeah,  he comes over when the stars are out.  And the guy went over there and fucking killed him.  And it turns out he never did anything.  But now the guy is writing a letter from jail saying, no, he was guilty.  Like the guy is trying to defend himself from prison.  Right.  Saying that the guy did do it.  But you can't, you got to be careful.  Let's go to Rob in Maryland. 
[02:28:00]  Rob.  Hey, morning, guys.  Hey.  I'm just wondering, he's telling these girls that this was a banana.  What happens if one of them decides to take a nibble?  Yeah, I guess there were some rules.  I guess there were some rules in the tasting game.  You already know it's a banana, so you don't need to, like, figure out it's a banana.  Has to be rules.  You just got to taste what's on the banana.  I want to save the banana for later, so just the topping.  This isn't the way I play it with daddy.  Oh, God.  That'd be funny if the chick took her blindfold off and winked. 
[02:28:30]  I know what you cuck.  I know what you do.  Let's knock the game shit off, okay?  Just gave him a wink.  I'm just in it for the rubber fingernails.  She just went, are you going to get hard or what, you faggot?  Could you come up with some better price?  Jesus Christ, Bobby.  I've been sucking your dick with butterscotch for 20 minutes and you're still soft.  Let's go.  Speed it up.  I got nap time.  Fuck.  What's wrong with you?  You're a married man.  What are you going to do? 
[02:29:00]  Let's go to Joe in Jersey.  Joe.  You mean the tasting game isn't real?  Great.  Playing the part of a victim.  That went over wonderfully.  Well, let's go to Wally.  Wally.  It's Sting.  Is he playing the loot?  Is Sting still looting?  Oh, motherfucker.  He's looting?  Hold on a minute.  We're on the Today Show.  Can we pilot?  Yeah.  Hold on.  How do we get to the loot? 
[02:29:30]  That sounds like Maury.  Oh, you just have to go and put...  Oh, it's too late.  That's stunning.  All right.  Switch up the TV so if they go back to the loot, we're ready.  Let's go to...  I hate the fucking loot.  I thought you were talking about if the Lakers won a championship again looting.  No, not that looting.  It's worse.  It's worse looting.  It's the loot that fucking Sting plays.  Wally.  Hey, boys.  Can you hear me this time?  Yeah.  G, Wally.  Yeah.  You know what?  I got two little girls and I would absolutely kill this fucking guy, but my step-sons, I'd let 
[02:30:00]  them do it.  Yeah, I think we should all just homeschool our children at this point.  Did he say he'd let his step-son do it?  Yeah.  Jesus.  I guess he was trying to make a joke that he doesn't care about them.  His little step-children.  Well, that's awful.  No, it isn't.  No one cares as much for their step-kids as they do for their real kids.  Yeah, I know that.  It just doesn't fucking happen.  I know.  Oh, you know?  I got punched in the face for five years. 
[02:30:30]  You know, personally?  Oh, yeah.  I was never a step-kid, so I don't know.  What years were you a step-kid?  From, uh...  17 to 22.  Oh.  30 to 35.  I was a step-kid, but that's like to Sal when I was already older.  I mean, like, as a kid, though, like, during those formative years, you're just fucked if  you were a step-kid.  Yeah, he, uh...  Yeah, my mother married Billy.  Billy.  Just a six-foot-four part of his head to the side. 
[02:31:00]  Really?  Oh, he'd throw me down a nice flight of stairs.  And he would, like, fucking beat you?  Uh, just call you stupid.  Smack you in the back of the head, and then he'd go...  He used to go make me wash his spokes on his, uh, Monte Carlo with T-tops.  With your tongue?  Wait, you lived...  You lived with your...  Wash my spokes.  You lived with your mother for a while?  Yeah, I lived with my...  Your birth mother?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I thought you didn't live with either parent.  No, no, no.  He lived...  That...  He's the guy who kind of set me off.  He...  She...  She didn't want to marry him, because he was a lunatic, but then she married him. 
[02:31:30]  And, uh...  Because she needed stability?  Was it one of those?  Oh, she...  Yeah, she lived...  We lived with my Irish Catholic family, like, 13 of us in a two-bedroom.  So, it was just creepy.  This is the start of every horrific movie, where it was the loving family, something happens  to the freaking husband, and then she goes out and gets a man because she needs the stability,  and then someone to raise the boy, and then that guy becomes the complete asshole.  Right.  And beats the shit out of the kids.  But they're always...  The guy was nice, though, at the beginning.  He was...  He was nice.  Oh, I can't...  I remember we...  They got married.  How old were you again?  I'm sorry. 
[02:32:00]  I had to be in first grade.  Kinder...  So, six to ten, six to eleven, around there?  Okay.  Yeah, five to...  Five to six.  Five to ten?  Young boy, you shouldn't see things like...  I went from sleeping on the floor to having my own bedroom.  My boy, Bobby got a heart big as all outside.  Oh, you dare hurt that boy.  Get the fuck out!  Get the fuck out of my house!  I'm fixing to kill you, Bobby. 
[02:32:30]  Reckon I'm going to take this blade, cut your head clean off.  Why don't you throw him down the stairs a few times first?  I like to watch it.  Fucking Bobby is getting beaten.  It's awful.  I go down and hug him a little bit and then throw him down the stairs.  So, you went from having no room to having your own room.  Mommy's got a new man in her life.  I remember walking to my bedroom. 
[02:33:00]  I had a toy box.  He filled it with toys because he had a lot of cash.  Yeah.  Filled it with toys.  My own bed.  I remember that I had a chandelier, like a little...  Well, it wasn't a chandelier.  It was like a light fixture.  Yeah.  I've never seen a light fixture before because at my grandmother's house, it was just the light bulb.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And I had a little side room with my own TV and a bean bag.  That sounds nice.  You don't understand how great it was.  It was unbelievable.  And then I remember being on my little bean bag.  I don't know how long.  It must have been months later. 
[02:33:30]  After he set you up nice.  New room, new toys.  Oh, toys.  Everything's good.  Desk.  Had a desk with all little school stuff in it, ready to go.  And then he set me up.  I was sleeping on my bean bag watching TV.  I fell asleep.  And I remember waking up and I was kind of just woke up from a nap.  This is my new life.  Five years old.  Yeah.  I had my own little room.  And I think I was in Fiji pajamas.  No, no.  I think I was in...  I actually had this shirt that said Slugger.  Oh, you're a little slugger. 
[02:34:00]  I had a baseball and it said Slugger.  Did your pajamas have a little bloody hatch in the back?  And it wasn't an SLU at the beginning of that shirt.  And I remember walking out and I heard a noise in the kitchen.  And I thought it was a TV.  I walk out.  My sister's crying.  And I've never seen anybody cry.  Oh, no.  Up to this point.  You know what I mean?  Oh, shit.  Sister's crying.  Oh, shit.  My mother... 
[02:34:30]  I walk in right when he punches her in the gut.  What?  Yeah, he just punched her right in the gut.  I punched my mom.  Wow.  My sister went to grab the phone and he hit her and ripped the phone up, but it was kind  of around her neck.  So she fell on the ground.  And then my mom...  And I'm in shock.  And then my mom grabbed us all into the room, shut my sister's door, and he was banging on  the...  This guy was 6'4".  Big, big dude.  He's banging on the door.  And then I remember I was... 
[02:35:00]  What'd your fucking mom do wrong?  Holy shit.  Continue.  I remember I was holding the door, trying to hold it back.  Because you were the...  I was...  Yeah, I was the guy.  The little man of the family.  The little man of the family.  Right.  He's trying to hold the door.  I was Slugger.  Oh.  And I remember he kicked the door and I went flying.  Smashed me against the wall.  So ever since then, you said, I'm going to be a fat fuck so that if this ever happens 
[02:35:30]  again...  I'll wait.  All right.  Sorry.  All right.  He kicks down the door, then what?  This is what's weird is I remember that this is the first time I've ever felt fear and  I pussied out.  And I regret it to this day.  Well, of course you're pussied out.  You're fine.  No, but...  You got a toy box full of toys.  I mean, come on.  Yeah.  He slammed me against the door and I hit the wall and I pretended to be hurt more than I  was. 
[02:36:00]  Oh.  You know what I mean?  Like, I pretended to be like...  Well, that was a tactic.  I pretended to be like gazed.  Yeah.  And it was self-preservation.  You were like playing possum.  You were playing possum instead of being a tiger.  No, playing dead.  He was playing dead.  Hoping the big bear would smell him and then walk away.  That's insane.  And then five years later, I chased him around the house with a knife and a hatchet.  But it wasn't to kill him.  Wait, wait, wait.  I had bread and butter and Bob was hungry.  So you pretended you were more hurt than you actually were?  Oh, yeah, dude.  Hold on, hold on. 
[02:36:30]  I hurt my knee, man.  I hurt my knee, man.  Wait, there's two...  Only back then.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand.  So, dude, you chased him with a knife.  Wait, wait, wait.  I want to back up, though.  So what did he do to you guys after he got in the room and you're, like, playing like  you're hurt and stuff?  Did he go after your mom and stuff?  He came in, he said one of those things you say, I don't know, like, you know, shut  the fuck up.  That type of shit.  You know, like, fuck you. 
[02:37:00]  Wow.  And, like, kind of like, if you didn't do this, then this wouldn't have fucking happened.  What was his problem?  Yeah, well, dude, just an anger issue or...  Dude, he was...  I think this is...  I don't think he wanted kids.  I wanted...  My mom was hot.  Oh, boy.  My mom was a hot mom.  I think he wanted my mom, but he didn't want...  Want the kids.  Hang on one second.  Yeah.  I just said my mom's hot.  Who went, hmm?  Who didn't?  Exactly.  And I think he wanted...  He didn't want to deal with us, but to get... 
[02:37:30]  My mom blew him off for a lot.  It was like, screw you, screw you, screw you.  And then he started treating us nice.  I mean, this guy's such a scumbag.  When my mom finally said, fuck you, I'm out of here.  And he had money, too.  He bought us Atari, but it was when Atari first came out.  Yeah.  And we were in sixth grade.  So it's like, he came...  She came home one night, and we were all sitting around, me, my sister, and him, playing Atari like best friends.  It totally worked. 
[02:38:00]  It totally worked.  We fucking were like, Mike, maybe you shouldn't divorce him.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, maybe you should work things out.  I mean, he's a fucking scumbag.  So he worked, you guys.  Oh, dude, he was a...  What happened to him?  I have no idea, dude.  I saw him one time...  He's dead.  ...years later.  Yeah.  I was working at Grossman's Bargain Outlet, and I seen...  I seen...  I don't know if it was him.  I'm 99% sure it was him.  And I saw him.  And this is when I was...  You know, I think I was like 22 or 20.  And I saw him, and I had to go upstairs and leave the floor, because I was going to fucking... 
[02:38:30]  I was going to get beat up by him again.  Yeah, you go up to be a tough guy, and he pushes you on the floor, and you make believe  you're hurt again, more than you are.  He pushes you over a carpet.  Punches me in the...  And then he goes beat...  He beats the shit out of my mom.  Just finds out where your mom lives and beats her up again.  I told you to keep this kid in check.  So then it drastically changed after that, and he started beating you guys?  Dude, this guy would...  I remember coming home late.  I was happy that I got Miss Julian for second grade. 
[02:39:00]  Who wouldn't be?  You know, at the end of the year, you got told who...  Who your teacher's going to be.  Who your teacher's going to be.  And it was either really good news or like, oh, fuck.  Right.  A summer of, oh, fuck.  Exactly.  You know that you're going in, Miss Irving, you're fucked.  I got Miss Julian, and she was...  It was great.  I was actually skipping home.  I got Miss Julian.  Did she play the taste game?  Huh?  No.  I wish she did.  Mr. Washington sure did.  Put chopped meat, lettuce, and tomato in there and say, eat the taco. 
[02:39:30]  Nice.  We're going to paint my pussy today.  Be wonderful.  Yeah, she...  I got home late, and I got in and I went...  I don't know if I called him dad.  I was like, hey, I got Miss Julian.  And he goes, you're fucking late.  I was supposed to be out of here 20 minutes ago.  And he threw me down a flight of stairs. 
[02:40:00]  And how old?  You were six, seven?  I was in second grade.  Second.  So you're 16.  Now you're up to about...  That was right.  I was actually 15.  I was 15.  I get it, Jim.  He's stupid.  He's as dumb as a day is long.  Wow.  So he tossed you down the fucking stairs.  Oh, yeah.  Nice hot one down the stairs.  And your mom just looked the other way?  You know what, dude?  I don't know.  I don't remember.  I remember telling her shit.  But I remember...  This is fucked. 
[02:40:30]  I remember I ran away.  Remember when you run away?  Good job.  Where are you going?  Yeah, it's like, dude...  You run to the end of the yard and then realize it's a scary place.  I ran to...  Over the fence.  Exactly.  Exactly, dude.  You run away.  You got such good...  I'm out.  I'm running away.  I'm gone.  And then you get like two blocks away and you've never been there.  You look around, it's just strange.  You feel like a mouse that saw humans for the first time.  They saw the...  And the weather's different two blocks away. 
[02:41:00]  The cars are bigger.  Right.  There's more noise.  Nothing familiar.  There's a little leaf out there.  I remember standing at the bus stop.  At a bus stop.  I just stopped at a bus stop crying.  Just crying.  And this hot chick was like, hey, where are you?  Blah, blah, blah.  You all right?  And I was like, I ran away.  And she was like, where do you live?  I'll take you home.  I was like, okay.  I just want to go home.  And I remember, you know, you run away because you want your parents to be like, where the  fuck were you? 
[02:41:30]  And I got home.  My mother opens the door.  Yep.  I don't think I ran away long enough.  Yeah.  You know, make sure you have to be away for at least a couple hours for her to panic.  Because if you come back 10 minutes later, she's like, hey, what's up?  Yeah, where'd you go?  Can I jump in?  Tim H. got it figured out in Columbus.  He writes, he ran away but ran out of breath at the end of the driveway and collapsed.  Bob was a good looking kid.  He was a good looking kid.  Bob was a slender.  I was at the cellar last weekend with the Philly crew and, you know, all those headshots. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  You know, as you're going downstairs.  Yeah.  There's one of you.  It's unrecognizable it's the same person.  I was gorgeous.  Bob was a fucking handsome pussy guy.  A full head of hair, no goatee.  Gorgeous.  Safe full lips.  Safe full lips.  Safe to say 40 pounds lighter?  40.  40.  More?  That was fucking two or a third Bobs ago.  I was 185 in that photo.  He's Bob on Jupiter now.  I'm teasing you, of course. 
[02:42:30]  I knew Bob back then.  Well, at least I was good looking once in my life, Norton.  Were you?  You lost a bunch of weight and you're still you.  Exactly.  So I learned to get pussy as a myth.  You, we, do we have a...  Well, it doesn't matter because you have a girl now.  I was saying, you'd be in bad shape if you were still single.  No, I wouldn't.  Shut up.  Excuse me.  Come on.  All right.  We got a song for Bob.  We got a song for Bob.  I said, shut up.  Bob, a little number.  Bob, just for you today.  Listen, listen closely.  Is it going to make me cry?  My name is Luca.  Ah. 
[02:43:00]  I live on the second floor.  Oh, yeah.  I talk when the game is on.  I know.  Yes, I think you've seen me before.  Ah.  Ah.  You hear something.  Ah.  Some kind of trouble, some kind of place.  Ah.  Just don't ask me what it was.  Stop talking.  Just don't ask me what it was.  Ah.  Just don't ask me. 
[02:43:30]  What it was.  I think it's because I'm clumsy.  I try not to.  Oh.  Oh.  Motherfucker.  Maybe it's because I'm crazy.  I try not to act proud.  Only hit me.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Jesus Christ, man.  What the hell is wrong with you?  Please.  Just shut up.  You just don't ask me.  You lie.  You're a fucking liar. 
[02:44:00]  Shut up.  You need to shut the fuck up.  No fucking way.  No fucking way.  No fucking way.  No fucking way.  Shut up.  You shut up.  You shut up.  Shut up.  God damn it.  Are you fucking with me?  You are fucking moron.  Would you kindly shut your noise hole?  Yes, I think I will.  Shut up and sit down, you big bald fuck.  What the hell is wrong with you? 
[02:44:30]  I hate you. 
[02:45:00]  I hate you.  I hate you.  Yes, I think you've seen me before.  Ringing a bell?  You guys are hitting so many buttons, it looks like you're launching the space shuttle.  Right down the steps they are.  We get it, you assholes.  A bunch of asses we are.  How many buttons did you just hit?  I don't know.  Hey, it's a sad day. 
[02:45:30]  All right, well, here you go.  My name is...  See, that makes it all better, Bob, right?  Well, I didn't finish the sad part.  Yeah.  When I left and I came back, my mom was crying, like, where are you?  Exactly what you want.  Oh, yeah.  When you run away.  And then when I got upstairs and she hugged me and said, I love you.  And I went, I love you too.  No, I went, oh, mom, I love you too. 
[02:46:00]  And I was high and everything was better.  You know what I mean?  Everything was better.  Yeah.  And it was hot.  Wait, here we go.  Ready?  Oh, boy.  All right.  Hang on.  Can't end like that.  Let me get the proper button.  Hold on.  Is that the way it ended?  A nice one?  No, no, no, no.  Oh, that's nice.  Why don't we go to break?  That's nice.  No, no, no.  Oh, that's real nice, Bob.  No, no.  I'm hiding under the coffee table, happy that I finally got some love and attention in second  grade, going into second grade.  Yeah.  And I heard my mother on the phone talking to one of her girlfriends.  And then she goes, and then he comes back and I told him I love you. 
[02:46:30]  And then he goes, oh, mom, I love you too.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, no.  So she laughed at that.  You thought it was like.  Hysterically.  And I remember.  Oh, and it was everything to you.  Oh, dude.  Oh, and just a fucking joke.  It was a. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, wait, wait, Bob.  Was it a joke or was she laughing like out of relief, like how cute it was?  I, dude, at the time, maybe now.  You broke my trust, dude.  You broke my trust, dude.  Voodoo deck, long beach.  You fucking idiot.  Ah, that was funny.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  You look like assholes right now, man. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, is that horrible?  Poor little Bob.  There you go.  Poor little Bob.  Wow, that really stuck out in your head too.  Oh, I remember it to this day.  Yeah.  Oh, mom, I love you.  And then he said, oh, mom, I love you.  What a dope.  And then he went into foster homes after that?  No.  Then I snapped.  Then I started using drugs in sixth grade.  Yeah, you should have.  That guy went after me one day and I pulled the knife out.  Nice.  And then a hatchet and I went after him. 
[02:48:00]  Nice.  And I was going to kill him too.  I'm not even kidding.  He stuck his hand.  My mother grabbed me.  He was like, go ahead, do it.  I didn't even think.  I just pulled the knife right down.  You were going to just kill him right there.  I was going to gut him.  Sixth grade, I was going to gut him.  I was going to gut him.  You'd have been out already.  Huh?  You'd have been out already.  What did mom say goodbye to you?  What'd you say?  Didn't your mom say goodbye to you too?  You had to start living in other places?  What is that?  What are you doing with the spoon?  Yeah. 
[02:48:30]  No, I went to jail.  I went to juvie jail.  At what age?  At what cute little Bobby age?  13.  13.  Juicy lips.  13, juvie hall.  Wow.  There's no gay sex in juvie.  Oh, please.  You're only in there for three months.  If you're sucking dick, you're gay.  You're getting out in a week.  I'm not saying you wanted to.  I'll suck your dick for cigarettes.  Dude, at 13, you got 100 boners a day, though. 
[02:49:00]  I bet when you walked in, they referred to your mouth as the fuckery.  You think black people knew what fuckery meant?  That's why you got full lips.  They're still swollen.  How do you know I have full lips?  Because you said, don't forget to talk about my full lips.  It was a callback.  Peter, Massachusetts.  What's up?  Oh, this story reminds me of when I was in third grade.  I got out of line.  My mom used to whack me with a whiffle ball bat.  One day she'd whack me.  I'm like, that's it.  I'm out of here. 
[02:49:30]  I'm running away.  I run down the street and I start hitchhiking.  Like, I'm going to, you know, run away.  Frickin' neighbors call my mother.  Tell them I'm down the street hitchhiking.  I see her car coming down the road.  She fucking says, get in.  Get home.  She just fucking beats me up some more with a whiffle ball bat.  That's great.  Then she made you do the challenge.  Good job.  His mom had to do the challenge in their asses.  Let's take a quick break.  I think Peter's on to something.  We want your stories of running away as like a third grader. 
[02:50:00]  Because it's just completely ridiculous.  But in your mindset back then, you were convinced, I'm running away.  Yeah, it's done.  But you're like eight.  Like, what are you going to do?  But a block is like ten miles.  Yeah, yeah.  I want to get some of those stories because it can be funny.  Like, then what finally hits you, like, ah, shit, I can't do this.  Fuck.  Yeah, I'm hungry.  I'm hungry, right.  I need clothes.  I need whatever.  I don't know.  The mistake you made was having that chick take you home instead of her place.  Yeah, really.  Oh, I wish.  What a goodie kushes. 
[02:50:30]  Scored.  I definitely relate to the guy that doesn't want the kids.  Because my mother was going out with some guy.  And he was like a lot younger than she was.  And he was just so demeaning to, especially me.  Like, my brother didn't give a shit because he was already out.  Like, he didn't care.  He'd just leave and smoke pot.  My sister was the girl and too young to really.  But me, I was just like constantly being fucking criticized by the guy. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  It was like everything I did.  Everything I did.  And then I was putting together a model of the visible V8.  It was a V8 engine.  And it was like you could see through it, you know.  And the little lights lit up when the spark plugs happened.  And I happened to put the crankshaft in backwards.  So, I'm like, the pistons wouldn't line up.  And then I realized I had to start taking shit apart.  And he comes and he goes, what happened?  I go, oh, I think I put the crankshaft in backwards.  And he goes, everything you do, you fuck up. 
[02:51:30]  He goes, everything you do, you just fuck it up.  And I'm just sitting there like, just fuck the model.  It's a model.  Let's fuck.  But everything was like that.  Everything I did was all fucked up.  Not good enough.  Don't fuck yourself, you cocksucker, you fucker.  You motherfucker, literally.  Yeah, fuck him.  Fuck mine.  That could have been a much worse story, though.  That could have been when he pushed my face into the model and ruined my bottom.  He just gave you a little scolding. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, no, it was all just like mental.  It was all this mental abuse like that.  Like, I was into drawing at one point.  And I had a little wooden case with pencils and paper and stuff.  And I would draw things.  Usually, I would try to draw naked chicks.  You know, you got to kind of have talent for that.  So, I'm just drawing.  And he'd come by and look and go, that sucks.  Jesus.  That sucks.  I love this guy.  Oh, he was the worst.  Dennis. 
[02:52:30]  Dennis was his name.  Oh, fuck yourself.  I used to figure my mind would make me go outside and do yard work.  And I'd pretend like a weed whacker.  Like, I wouldn't do it right.  And he'd come out and go, look, you got to do it this way.  And then he'd do it a little bit.  Good do it then.  Give it back.  And then he'd fuck it up again.  And he'd go, just get the fuck out of here, you idiot.  And he'd just wind up doing it.  It was stupid.  He was like, good.  I didn't want to do it, you fucking idiot.  Who's the idiot now?  That was a douche.  Oh, I should have stabbed him.  Hey, we got some phone calls coming in.  This is the mind of, like, a seven-year-old. 
[02:53:00]  Here we go.  John in Texas.  Go ahead.  Tell your story.  Yeah, man.  I don't know what it was, but I got fed up.  Had enough.  And I grabbed, you know, the old big brown paper sack you get groceries for.  And I popped it full of clothes I could get out of my drawers.  Started out the house.  And, you know, without any hesitation, I got probably, as far as the mailbox, and the bag  just got too fucking heavy.  I came back to the house.  Oh, that's good.  And my mom and dad, my aunt and uncle, are sitting inside the house laughing. 
[02:53:30]  And they'd lock the fucking door and wouldn't let me back in.  Jesus.  That's what I want to hear.  Because everyone has the great idea of, I'm going to run away.  And then what caused you to turn around and go, ah, fuck, I'm stuck until I'm 14, 15.  Fucking Clarice Starling was better at running away than you, too.  She carried a lamb.  I know.  You grabbed two hams and a butt cake.  Let's go to Cross Critter.  Cross Critter.  Hey, boys.  I was about, I was living over in Japan.  We were in the Air Force and everything. 
[02:54:00]  And me and my sister, I was in the first grade.  We took off, even grabbed my, you know, goofy-ass little stuffed animal.  Went down to the, ah, the park there.  Waited until, gosh, it must have been about 8, 9 o'clock at night.  Ended up, we, we just, you know, chickened out.  Went back to the house.  My parents were in bed asleep.  Didn't even know we were gone.  Thanks for sharing.  Yeah.  Okay.  And then he hung up.  All right.  All right.  Get what he meant, but he didn't really tell it with much, um. 
[02:54:30]  Gusto?  Gusto.  Let's go to Tom in Philly.  Tom.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Good.  When I was about five years old, I ran away from home, but I wasn't allowed to cross  the street, so I just ran around the block.  Hoping a bridge was built.  We got Doug in Los Angeles.  Doug.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  Okay.  When I was either 7 or 8, my mom caught me playing doctor with this girl down the street. 
[02:55:00]  So, she grounds me, and I was so upset at this that I ended up, I decided to run away.  I threw a bunch of toys into a pillowcase, and I opened my window, and I was going to  run away just going out through the window, but I couldn't bring myself to do it.  So, I'm sitting there on the windowsill for about 45 minutes until she finally, you know,  poked her head into my bedroom to see what I was doing.  Because I just had to sit there until the last second when she was going to, you opened  the door, and then I was going to jump out the window.  I wish that happened in the 20th floor. 
[02:55:30]  I know what he's saying, though.  I did that.  You don't want to kill you.  I tried to fake suicide.  I hung out a window for an hour, and they never came up.  I was like, and I'm crying, and then I'm waiting for them to try to knock on the door  and get in.  I put the bureau up against the door so they could get in.  So, they wanted to break it.  What are you doing?  And then I was going to pretend to jump, and they finally did come up, but the bureau 
[02:56:00]  opened too quick, so they just went there, and they're like, what are you doing, dummy?  I think my father went, it's a second-floor window.  What, are you going to break an elbow?  You're not going to kill yourself.  Well, no, this is the first floor.  I wanted them to see me as I was leaving, but I couldn't commit to the running away.  Oh, all right.  You wanted them to stop you and rescue you.  Yeah.  Let's go to David and Dallas.  A couple more of these.  David?  Yeah, I got as far as the neighbor's garage. 
[02:56:30]  All right, hold on.  What?  I ran away.  I was about eight years old.  I got as far as the neighbor's garage.  Fell asleep in there.  There's five of us in my family.  Nobody knew I was fucking gone.  All right, here's the kicker.  Here's the kicker.  I brought my dog with me.  It wasn't a fucking chihuahua.  It was a goddamn Great Dane.  And they didn't know either one of us were gone.  Probably happy.  They probably were calling the dog.  Yeah.  Come here, boy.  They probably were a while.  They probably took the dog eight in me and left.  I don't know.  But, you know, that's my life as the youngest of five. 
[02:57:00]  There you go.  Thanks, David.  Two more, and then we'll move on.  Mike in Kentucky.  What's up?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hey.  Yeah, my old man was going to whip my ass with a belt for about the 60th time, and I decided  that I wasn't going to have it anymore, so I grabbed my shotgun, went on out in the woods.  I was probably about nine years old.  I was going to go out there and be Grizzly Adams and survive on the land.  Yeah.  I got out there and sat around.  It was in the fall time for about five, six hours. 
[02:57:30]  It started getting dark, and I got scared.  I remember my old man yelling at me when I was in the woods.  You got to come back to eat, you little thump bitch.  So, I was getting hungry, and he was right.  I went on back to the house, and they fed me, and then he put me in the bedroom there,  and he got the belt out, whipped my ass with the belt anyway.  It was probably harder than he was going to.  Wow.  That's good.  So, you are going to run away.  He's got a good belting on the ass.  And then it got dark, and you had to turn around.  I got dark.  It got dark. 
[02:58:00]  I got hungry, and he was right, and I probably got it worse than I would have if I just would  have hung around.  But that was my lesson.  See, I knew it.  Most of these end with, you got to go back home.  But this guy, I wonder if this is true.  Richie in Connecticut, tell your story.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  I was 12 years old.  It was 1986.  I ran away to Washington, the state of Washington.  I was from Long Island.  My parents were Coke dealers, and I just took $8,000.  They didn't even know I was gone for two weeks.  They thought I was at my grandmother's house.  And you really went cross-country at 12? 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  I got nailed in McDonald's.  The reason I went to Washington, because the Goonies were from Washington.  I couldn't believe it was them or some shit like that.  Wait, wait.  Hold on, sir.  You got a big laugh, so we missed the next line.  So the Goonies were from Washington.  So I thought I'd go live out there and, you know, live with the Goonies or something.  I don't know how I was thinking.  But I took, they caught me in McDonald's because there was a cop next to me, and I took out,  like, I had, like, $600 in cash. 
[02:59:00]  And he's like, where'd you get that money, little fella?  And they wound up nailing me that way.  Oh, that sucks.  Smart enough to get a cross-country with $8,000, dumb enough to think the Goonies are real.  I mean, you took it 12 years old, at least I wasn't sucking cock under it.  You missed out.  That's true.  You should have turned your parents in.  Yeah, well, Bob Cup sucks.  I helped me die.  That was really funny, though.  Oliver, Texas, what's up? 
[02:59:30]  Hey, guys, what's going on?  Hey.  I remember one time when I was, like, years old, I got pissed at my mom.  I don't know what she wanted me to do.  I think it was, like, clean my room.  And I looked up at her and I said, well, you know what?  You don't love me anymore.  I'm going to run away.  And she looked down at me with that stern face.  My mom had a set of balls on her.  And she looked down at me, and she goes, well, fucking do it.  And so she goes off and does her own little thing, sits down.  I don't know what she was doing.  So I walk outside.  Right when I get into the middle of the street, I look back at the house.  I got cold.  And I just said to myself, oh, well, she's going to come out 
[03:00:00]  because she's going to feel sorry.  She's going to be crying.  She's not going to know where I am.  So what I ended up doing is I hid in the neighbor's bushes.  And so I'm crouched there in the bushes like a dumbass.  And the neighbor comes out and looks into the bushes and sees me.  And I look it up in one of those big eyes.  And I said, shh, I'm not here.  My neighbor pretended I wasn't there.  And then he comes out with the big old, you know, that huge water gun you attach to your water hoses.  Yeah.  It starts spraying me down, and I get all wet and muddy. 
[03:00:30]  And so when I come back home, I finally, because I was getting sick,  so I come back home, I walk inside.  My mom's sitting there having a martini on the couch.  She looks at me, and she just starts laughing.  And I just go home a wet mess and a broken shell of a kid.  But, oh, Jesus, that is good.  Yeah, I'm checking out, guys.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Bill in Iowa.  Bill!  Yeah, I was, like, seven, and I'm like, yeah, I'm doing the same thing.  I'm running the fuck away, you guys, or whatever.  I had to clean my room, something stupid like that.  I mean, I was like, all right, fine.  So he throws all my shit in a bag, gets me in the car, and drives me out of the bus station. 
[03:01:00]  Here, I got your one-way ticket.  Where do you want to go?  And I started bawling like a little girl with a skinned knee.  And, of course, went home that night and spent the week in the house, in the room.  See, they never worked out.  It seems like a good idea.  But, uh, you bailed at the last minute.  Let's go to Bruce in North Carolina.  Bruce.  Yeah, I ran away in nothing but my underwear one time.  I told my mom I was going to run away, and she says, well, I bought those fucking clothes,  so take them off. 
[03:01:30]  Jesus.  And run away.  You run away naked.  And all she let me wear was a pair of fucking tighty-whities.  I made it about six miles before.  Before you had lots of rides.  Yeah, exactly.  Imagine a pedophile going, oh, my God.  All right, who's fucking with me?  He was just out of one car door into the next one.  It's got to be my pedophile friend.  They're fucking with me.  What is this, April 1st?  What's going on?  That's a midget.  There's no way.  That's real.  Huh?  I swear to God, a cop picked me up and then took me to my grandparents' house, and then 
[03:02:00]  they got me some clothes.  Oh, you're so lucky, my friend.  Yeah.  We're trying to move on, but the stories are really coming.  Like, we got James in Iowa.  James, go ahead.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  Hey, when I was 16 years old, my parents ran away from me.  They ran away from you?  I come home from the school.  My mom, my dad, and my little brother moved to a whole new town.  Get out of here.  That's God's truth, man.  Were they renting, or was it... 
[03:02:30]  No, I got in a fight.  The old man knocked the hell out of him, and I was 16, and they sold the fucking house  and moved the whole thing three days.  And where were you then?  You didn't notice this was going down.  I was in high school.  I was 16.  I was going to school.  Right, right.  They went and picked up my brother from school early.  I didn't know it, because he was in grade school.  Did you know where they...  I got home.  Go ahead.  I got home, and all my shit was on the front porch.  The fuck the fuck says the house was empty, but the fuck the hell, I hung out for a few 
[03:03:00]  years.  I didn't know where they lived when I was 21 years old and married.  Wow.  That's a great story, man.  Jesus.  Yeah, laugh if you will, motherfuckers.  It kind of destroyed my life.  Oh, I'm sorry.  No, I just thought the way the other thing.  I'm just kidding.  What'd you call up for help?  Yeah, no kidding.  That retard kid in the humpback fucking retard.  Oh, that's pretty funny, man.  All right, thank you, sir.  I'm just kidding.  Is this the Brother Joe?  Brother Joe.  Yo, guys. 
[03:03:30]  Ant, do you remember in Central Islip when I ran away, and you went out...  You went out...  Actually, you encouraged me to do it at first, and then you went out, and you busted me,  and you brought me back home, and the old man beat the living shit out of...  Wait, what happened?  I figured I could make some points.  Really?  On bringing him back.  Yeah, like, I'll bring him back.  I'll get him.  He's a politician?  Yeah, first, I'm like, I'm telling him to go, and he goes, and then I was like, yeah, 
[03:04:00]  I know where he is, so I'll bring him back.  And I brought him back, and of course, yeah, the old man pulled out the strap and nailed  both of us.  Yeah.  Why you, though?  You guys were...  I don't know.  Were you in cahoots together?  It was what to do.  Because he's a fucking traitor.  Yeah, I was a traitor.  Fucking traitor.  Turn your brother in.  I'll bring your boy back.  The head, the tail, the whole damn thing.  The whole damn thing.  Okay, so I can run away again.  I'll talk to you later.  All right, man. 
[03:04:30]  We got...  Well, this one's pretty good, too.  Damn.  Tom in Westchester.  What's up, Tom?  Hey, boys.  I ran away when I was about 11.  I took my Raleigh 3-speed.  I drove from the Bronx to Orchard Beach.  What, a banana seat?  Yeah, I handle my sissy bar.  Hold on, hold on.  You got to back up a little bit, Tom.  Yeah.  So you rode from where to where?  Yeah, I was 11 years old.  I ran away from home because I was pissed at my parents.  I took my Raleigh 3-speed bike.  I drove to Orchard Beach about maybe a quarter mile from the beach when I got a flat tire or 
[03:05:00]  the chain fell off or something.  This guy pulls up while I'm walking, says he'll take me home, opens up his trunk and  throws my bike in.  And I'm just about to get into the driver's side of the car when I look in the back seat  because I had a weird feeling about this dude.  Both of the back door locks were wired shut with coat hangers.  No.  I said, I said, no, no, no, thanks.  I'm not going to get in the car.  Just give me my bike back.  The guy started screaming and pleading at me to get in.  When I refused, he drove away with the bike.  I had to go to the stranger's house and call my parents.  My father picked me up in the car and fucking beat the shit out of me. 
[03:05:30]  You never saw your bike again, huh?  Guys, I sniffed the seat.  God damn it.  No covering left on it.  All they found was the seat with nostril marks all over it.  Oh, were you a little sweaty, upset with dad boy acid in the city?  Only a few hours before.  That guy's probably like a bloodhound.  He probably smelled your bike seat so much he knew what you were fighting about.  Oh, he was upset he wanted to stay out later. 
[03:06:00]  He wears Landry Tomp, but not today.  Let's go to Jeff in Jersey.  His seat is worn.  In a way, I'm sure he wears tough skins.  You know how big your bag was?  By the way, his little ball mark was very subtly worn to the side of your seat.  You're fucking the CSI of children's seats.  He knew exactly.  All those wheelies you did, you frightened boy ass. 
[03:06:30]  Wow, let's go to Jeff.  Hey, Jeff, you're on the OPNF show.  How's it going?  I actually have a runaway story that worked.  I was about eight years old.  I wanted to go on a trip with my friends.  And I ran away, and I snuck back in through the basement  and snuck back up to the basement door and listened to them.  And, you know, they laughed about it when I first left.  And time went on and time went on.  And, you know, meanwhile, there's all the luxuries of a house in the basement. 
[03:07:00]  There's TV to watch, a couch.  I just relaxed and listened to them freak out more and more  to the point where they called the police and they left the house.  When they left the house, I had a free run of the house.  I just hung out, watched TV, ate dinner,  and waited until they finally came back freaking out.  And then let them know, you know, I'm going on the trip  and ended up going on the trip.  Yeah.  Macaulay Colton.  Ah, whatever.  Macaulay Colton?  I got a little nervous with the c-c-c-cals. 
[03:07:30]  Macaulay Colton.  That was the first one to snap on you when you mispronounce something.  Well, dude, that wasn't just a close one.  Macaulay Colton doesn't exist.  You made a person up.  I hate how serial killer smart you are.  You don't have to be smart to know Macaulay Colton.  That's not exactly a Harvard B.A.  to know that little douche.  Yeah, you bang trannies.  Who doesn't?  What am I, a communist?  That's my comeback.  He just pulls that one out whenever he can.  I'm surprised you didn't call him trannies, stupid. 
[03:08:00]  A little t-shirt.  Let's go to Washington.  Brad, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  Hey, a little back story.  My stepdad was just getting out of the military, so we decided we were going to tour Europe  on motorcycles.  I was about seven years old, and I wanted some ice cream, and I wanted it bad.  And complained, complained, complained, and next thing I know, I'm standing in a street  corner in France by myself for about two hours. 
[03:08:30]  Now, if that didn't scare the shit out of me, then nothing did.  Yeah, you wouldn't even know where the hell you are.  That's creepy as a kid.  Yeah, in France.  In France.  All right, we got it.  Thank God it worked out.  So you're Macaulay Culkin.  Yeah, Macaulay Culkin.  Culkin.  Macaulay Culkin.  We're going to try one more, and then we're going to possibly end this.  I was doing a character.  There was a word you couldn't say, but we'll get back to that.  Remind me of what he couldn't say.  Oh, go ahead.  I don't remember.  What word couldn't you say? 
[03:09:00]  Oh, I can't say phoranthepist.  Eminent.  Phoranthepist.  Phoranthepist?  Eminent?  Yeah.  Eminent?  You said it now, right, but you can't say enemant.  I can't say, I can say, fuck me.  Enemant?  What word can't you say?  Phoranthepist?  What is it?  How do you say it?  Just say it.  It doesn't matter.  Just say it once and I can get it.  No.  Why, so you do an impression like a parrot?  No.  Figure it out.  Say entemans a few more times.  Entemans?  I could say that.  That's what I could say.  Eminent, he could say.  Phoranthepist. 
[03:09:30]  Phoranthepist.  Phoranthropist.  A phoranthropist.  Now you get me saying it wrong.  Fuck.  It happens.  Palopanese.  Palopanese.  A phoranthropist.  That's somebody who's nice to flowers.  All right, let's...  Rachel.  Jason in New York, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  When I was about seven years old, we lived in the country.  We never lived in a town, so I got really pissed off at my dad one day, and I went into  the woods, and we had a bear. 
[03:10:00]  We had a bear and a couple coyotes that lived around the house, and a bobcat, so by dark  time, I got pretty scared, and a deer ran through the yard, and I freaked out and ran  back to the house.  That's all it took.  Yeah.  I think it's funny now that even as an adult, you describe it as dark time.  It's a childlike description.  Dark time.  Dark time came.  Dark time came.  I had to go.  I got to piss.  Yeah, we'll take a break.  Kevin and...  Kevin the trucker, what's up?  Hey, man.  I was about 12 years old. 
[03:10:30]  I hated my dad.  My mom wouldn't leave me.  He used to knock us kids around quite a bit.  So I decided I was going to run away.  I was going to go live with my stepdad.  My mom would see his husband in Arizona, living in Washington State, so I hitchhiked  down I-5, ended up getting a ride all the way to Hollywood, and I was walking around  the streets of Hollywood, walking down the hill, and the guy goes, whoa, you...  I was looking up at the building, and the guy goes, whoa, you can't go that way.  Not from around here, obviously.  I'll give you a place to stay.  Well, he was living with his sister in a flat in North Sycamore Street or whatever, 
[03:11:00]  somewhere around there, and he'd go to work, and his sister, Debbie,  he turned out to be his girlfriend, de-virginized me, and found out that it was going on, and  he took me down to the basement, or was trying to, and I hit the first floor button on the  elevator.  He chased me down the street with a meat cleaver.  I ended up in Arizona in a jubilant institution, and my dad flew me back home, so I ended up. 
[03:11:30]  Shake it up!  Oh, God!  Shake it up!  Shake it up!  Shake it up!  Shake it up!  I'm sorry, man.  I smoke a lot.  Yeah.  It sounds like you already have the drink.  What do you smoke, carburetors?  Keep smoking.  All right, sir.  Good story. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah, man, take it easy.  All right, well, this is worth doing too.  Say the guy lived in a bacon-smoking house.  Shake it up.  He lived in a glass gargulterium.  What'd you do?  We made asbestos cookies.  Or the kingdom of nakedness.  Yeah, he scored.  So I went out to the desert and started the kingdom of nakedness.  That is some friggin' voice, man.  Lionheart, what's up? 
[03:12:30]  What's up, pal?  How's it going on?  Hey.  Hey, quick, we all got to piss.  Yeah, there's a lot of peeing that's about to happen.  I'm not going to take a shit.  I was about nine in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  I figured I was going to take off.  I was mad at my dad for something.  And I figured the best place, me and my friends had this fort,  you know, we built in this woods by our house.  I figured I was going to head out there because, you know,  that's a safe place to be.  But around that clock, I realized, man, I should have brought a light.  It's really dark out here.  And then about 10 o'clock, I realized that the fort where I had,  me and my kids played during the day, 
[03:13:00]  was where they did a lot of drug deals at night.  Oh, I'm sorry, dude.  How about you hung up on me?  No, we're listening.  We want to.  We're good listeners on the show from time to time.  No, they just, they started doing drug deals around me and looking at me  and talking to each other about me.  And eventually I just left and I went to,  the only other thing I knew to do was go to Krausers and ask them if I could stay there.  Krausers?  And they called the cops.  What a Jersey reference. 
[03:13:30]  And called the cops.  What's Krausers?  Together, the 7-Eleven in Jersey.  I was like, can I, like, work here and you give me some food or something?  What is this, the fucking 30s?  He's one of the little rascals.  Can I work here?  Sure you can, kid.  But you can't bring that dog.  And they told me I could, so they put me doing something in the back.  Thank you.  And they called the cops and they showed up.  Oh.  They're like, this douchebag kid is back there working.  Yeah, you always had the impression that you should have the stick with the fucking bandana on it  and something in there. 
[03:14:00]  I don't know what it was, but something was supposed to be in there when you ran away.  A can of beans.  Yeah.  Fucking diaper.  Homeless people always ate beans.  Beans.  Beans.  Yeah, they did.  Come on.  On the can.  They had just that bandana and the stick, but then all of a sudden there was a frying pan somewhere.  They'd have a frying pan, beans, and a big, huge fucking spoon to shovel it into their mouths with.  And the beans always looked great.  Did they?  Oh, they looked great with a big hunk of pork in it.  All right, we got to take a break.  We got some familiar faces outside today. 
[03:14:30]  Hello.  Yeah, I put them up on the cam.  Say hi, pal.  Talk.  Red rum.  Red rum.  You got all the hot chicks.  Red rum.  All the hot chicks.  Oh, I didn't even know that was her.  Red rum's in studio.  I zoom in on them.  They get all embarrassed.  I don't recognize her in clothing.  I know.  It's a little strange.  They get embarrassed.  Watch.  She gets naked.  She's the one who shower cams.  Oh, my God.  I'll give you a little zoom in on this girl.  No, she's the other girl.  Not me.  I don't do that.  I'll keep her on camera, though.  I don't do that.  Red rum, will you get naked for Bob Kelly today?  Sure.  She don't give a shit.  Is her boyfriend here? 
[03:15:00]  Her husband.  A husband?  Is that the married woman?  The guy looks like me if I was in a biker gang and I killed seven people?  Yeah.  That's great.  That should be comfortable.  They could have sex in front of you.  What do you want?  I don't care.  I'm married.  Do whatever you want now.  I don't fucking...  It's plug time.  Bob, where are you going to be?  Uncle Vinny's.  Friday and Saturday night.  Call 877-UNCLE-VIN for tickets.  Very good.  And Rob Bartlett?  November 10th.  Saturday night.  Seven Angels Theater.  Waterbury, Connecticut. 
[03:15:30]  Robshow.com.  Robshow.com.  Robshow.com.  You want to get information.  I'm going to be in the bathroom.  Well, Jimmy's going to be in Queensbury.  Queensbury, New York.  This Friday, Saturday.  What's the name of that place, Rob?  Sweet Basil's.  Sweet Basil's Restaurant.  There's a fucking SaratogaComedyClub.com.  I think it's called.  Anti-pasta and laugh.  Yes.  Should be a lot of fun.  The appetizer is laughter.  Yucks are on the menu.  I got to piss.  Yeah.  It's piss time.  I broke my knee, man. 
[03:16:00]  I broke my knee, man.  Knee, man.  Knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  What the fuck the fuck the fuck? 
[03:16:30]  Oh, my hand, man.  Hi.  Hi.  You mother.  Hi.  I just love listening to Opie and Anthony.  Sometimes I laugh so hard,  I forget about all the times  my Uncle Henry rubbed my special place.  Opie and Anthony. 
[03:17:00]  All right.  Piss break is over.  Opie and Anthony.  What's up?  What's up?  Shake it up.  Rob Bartlett in studio and he just informed all of us.  He's been hanging with us for about three hours  and finally he decided to tell us that  in his pocket he has a few kidney stones.  Yeah.  Wow.  A few.  Let me see that.  Holy jeez. 
[03:17:30]  Now you have to take that to the doctor  to have him figure it out.  I know your doctor needs him.  Analyzing?  It's got to be analyzed.  Oh, my God.  That came out of your pee hole?  How did you catch that tiny one?  Well, you've got to pee through like a strain.  You've got to have a little fishnet, you know?  First, it has to travel through like  fucking angel hair pasta kidney.  Right.  Which, like your kidney is just a bunch of  wound up fucking thin pasta. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah.  And it's got to go through all that.  Yeah.  Which is just horrific pain.  Well, what happened?  What did you do?  Did you drop one?  You didn't drop one.  No, you didn't.  You just didn't do...  You just did not do...  Oh, my God.  Did you do a poker chip thing of my kidney stones?  No, I didn't mean to.  You fuck.  I didn't mean to.  I got nervous.  What's that?  One bite fell out.  No.  Oh, you know.  God damn it.  There's my cure right there.  Wait, can you get it?  My cure.  No, that's a crumb.  It's going to be a crumb or a rock. 
[03:18:30]  The doctor's going to be like,  what the fuck is this?  Well, you've got too much urea acid  and you should use a little less yeast.  Anyone have a flashlight?  Son of a bitch.  God damn it, O.P.  O.P., you ass.  I didn't mean to.  That thing you have for that fucking thing  out of travel?  He's on all four.  Rob, first of all...  I had blood coming out of the end of my dick  and you lost it.  I almost...  I only lost a little.  I'm going to do it.  I have to blame Rob a little bit  because why are you giving O.P. anything?  You know the show well enough. 
[03:19:00]  No, you don't understand.  I didn't mean to drop it.  I just got nervous  because I knew they were valuable.  This one was actually one.  It broke in two pieces.  Oh, what a big piss hole you must have.  I know.  See, it's the whole point.  I was able to pluck the one from the end,  which was good.  Oh, how awesome.  It was just stuck there?  Stuck there.  Which is great.  It's always fun when you're trying to pee  while there's a rock stuck in the end of your dick.  It's kind of like the little sprinkler  you just have when you're a kid.  It's spraying all over your bathroom.  Is that a tooth?  Did your tooth break? 
[03:19:30]  What was that?  No, it looks like a piece of...  It looks like a baby tooth.  Like a kernel.  Yeah.  From popcorn.  Can someone hold that in their mouth?  Half a kernel, it looks like.  Can one of our guys hold that in their mouth?  Christ.  Not eat it, but just hold it in their mouth.  The results will be all fucked up.  That's right.  A lot of man's saliva on it  and they'll think he's getting his dick stuck.  Some guy.  Oh, that old gag.  That's all right.  We don't have to do anything.  Just have your boyfriend suck the rest out.  We got good news and we got bad news.  Oh, man.  I'm telling you. 
[03:20:00]  Oh, that's...  It's worse than getting your dick caught in your zipper.  I never had it.  My brother had them and said they were just...  Oh, I don't know about that.  It was the worst pain.  It's Pat Duffy around.  Why?  Why?  Not today.  Oh, fuck.  Because you said it's worse than getting your dick caught in your zipper.  Our boy Pat Duffy would do a little experiment.  I don't think you could do that on purpose.  We'd have to give him a kidney stone, though, so he could compare.  That's one of those things like, go ahead, punch yourself in the face.  Like, I don't think you could really give it your all.  Well, someone remind me tomorrow, because Pat Duffy will be in tomorrow and we'll have 
[03:20:30]  Pat...  You've got to accidentally zip your dick up.  I think he could, like, keep a little, like, a little out, a little skin out.  Maybe we could have a friend help.  Then he'd do it slow.  Franks and beans!  No, you've got to pull a little out.  Yeah.  Zip her down, holding the skin that got pulled out, and on three.  That isn't even how you do it.  Oh, man.  And the worst part of zipping up, because right now I'm in pain just thinking about it, is  that surprise, because you never intend on doing it.  Oh, no.  It's when you go zip and just... 
[03:21:00]  Oh!  The worst place is when you zip over the cock hole, like, over the hole itself, and  you zip up, and the bottom piece is caught like a fish hook on a lip, so then you have  to fucking...  Because your cock...  You can't pull back because your cock skin is caught.  That's great.  And then after you're done, about an hour later, it looks like you're pissing out of Amadou  Diallo.  Keep going.  Kelly's about to puke.  Kelly, you want to see his kidney stones?  Yeah, I would love that.  That shouldn't get you to puken.  I would love to see it.  Would you let someone give you a paper cut across your cock hole? 
[03:21:30]  No.  How about your eyeball?  God damn it.  Don't say paper cut in the cock hole.  How about the edge of the corner of the paper?  That almost happened the other night with Esty at the cellar, just grabbed the set list  and dragged it in front of my face, and it almost sliced my eyeball.  Imagine taking the corner of some sharp paper, just poking it out at the corner.  Oh, I can do that.  That's easy.  Esty's still at the cellar?  Oh, yeah.  How about Soupy?  Oh, yeah.  Who's Soupy?  Who's Soupy?  I think he died.  Sales?  No, it was a guy named Soupy.  He was being manager with Esty.  Soupy... 
[03:22:00]  Can I see the thing that came out of your penis?  Just as a tribute to the size of my cock.  He's got a man to the doctor.  Yeah, it really is.  Wow.  You know, if you smash this and put it in tea, it cures cancer.  I'm hung like a salmon.  That came out of your penis.  And what is this?  Kidney stone, man.  We don't know.  It's a kidney stone, but we don't know what it's...  It's probably, what, calcium or something?  Calcium or...  We don't know.  Salt.  I take medication to keep me from getting ureic acid kidney stones, but obviously it's  not that.  Sure, it's not a piece of candy from a kid? 
[03:22:30]  It might have been, you know.  We do play the tasting game.  It looks like a little tooth from a shih tzu.  Oh, wow.  Pop rocks.  It's kind of creepy.  Oh, wow.  Ow.  All right.  Why can't they be, like, smooth like pearls?  Oh, no.  Smooth and round.  I'm going to have earrings made.  Something like jade comes out of your dick or fucking diamonds or something.  It's got to be some kind of crappy fucking calcium thing you can get anywhere. 
[03:23:00]  If you piss diamonds, at least it would be worth the pain.  Oh, ow, ow.  Oh, that's a nice one.  All cut.  And somebody lops your arm off.  We're going to play this.  He just hobbles you so he can't leave.  Remember Lee Abrams was in.  He said the audio of the...  I know.  Oh.  The mid-air collision was out.  Yes.  We got the audio.  Yes, Republic Airport.  Two small planes kind of banged into each other on the way in.  That happens a lot at Republic. 
[03:23:30]  When?  About two, three weeks ago.  Oh, okay.  Around there.  I live really near there.  That's why I was curious.  Who is today?  I might want to make a call home.  They both landed, though.  Oh, they did?  They were both able to land.  But I remember a few years back, probably about over 12 years, maybe 15, two planes were  coming in, and one was above the other one and didn't see him, and he was descending  at a faster rate and came right down on top of him, as they were both still in the air,  and both of them just...  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  Probably didn't make that sound. 
[03:24:00]  That would be silly.  Yeah.  But...  Died listening to cartoon sound effects.  Yeah.  Wow, wow, wow.  Actually, one plane went...  As he flew all around the sky.  Beep, beep.  And the other one hit with a tremendous...  Hey, Bob, can we play a video for you today?  What's that?  Just a video.  Oh, no.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he's really good.  Yeah, sure.  All right.  Just a video.  This shouldn't be awful for you.  That's what's going on? 
[03:24:30]  Yeah, don't worry about it.  I can put it up.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you put it up on the other screens?  Yeah, put it up on the new studio.  We got screens lying around all over here.  Oh, Opie's...  You want screens, Norton?  We got screens.  We got screens.  We need to send...  Well, lousy with screens.  Oh, lousy.  We need to send Opie...  Get the screens, Norton.  Get the screens.  Some men are going to watch some television.  We need to send Opie to an acting class.  We really do.  He's losing his touch.  There used to be a day where he actually set people up, and they'd be like, yeah, sure,  no problem. 
[03:25:00]  But now he's like, hey, Bob, can we show a video?  He acts like Norton on Lucky Louie.  Oh, that was very good.  Oh, wow, that was very good.  I was kidding.  He is good.  He is good.  I'm not even trying a bad actor.  Why would someone that calls you stupid fat Bob Kelly, why would you annoy him with that  and insult him?  Norton is a good actor, as long as there's no sound and a villain with a woman on a train  track.  Yeah, no music. 
[03:25:30]  Just in case...  Angry.  Scared.  Just in case you're hoping to look away, we got it on six different screens.  Wow.  Yeah, look at this.  He won't look away.  It's all over.  It's a stupid video.  Don't look away, Bob.  No, of course.  Listen to me.  Look that way, though.  You put my cell phone in someone's asshole, I pretty...  Look, this screen's a lot closer.  Oh, that's kind of cool.  What is that?  All right, here.  Turn this way.  Turn this way.  This is weird.  No, Bob, turn that way.  I'm right here.  Yeah, but that's closer.  Actually, that's actually better for me. 
[03:26:00]  All right.  All right, whatever you want to do.  I'm sorry.  Let's see if I can find a screen here.  Are you guys going to try to make me throw up?  No.  No.  Why would we do that, Bob?  No, let me ask you something.  Just to let you know, I got nothing in me.  I had the shits all day yesterday.  That was pretty good.  I like it.  Bob.  Bob.  Bob.  Good, good, good, good.  There we go.  Is it Carly?  All right, you ready?  I can just put it straight on the count.  Oh, you're a good guy.  All right, you ready?  Yeah.  Don't read my email, Paul. 
[03:26:30]  Here we go.  What is it?  Make it full screen there.  Here we go.  For you, Bob.  Let's go.  It's hot.  It's lesbian stuff.  See, the girl's like...  You got to let Bob look.  Wait.  Stop the tape.  Stop the tape.  Stop the tape.  Stop the tape.  Go back.  Go back fast.  Stop the tape.  Bob saw only two seconds.  Oh, my dear Lord.  A girl shitting a comic.  And all of a sudden, Mr. Sensitive is fucking gagging. 
[03:27:00]  So now we have to start over, Bob.  Wait a second.  Bob, you didn't even get to the good part.  I don't like the fact that it makes one comic throw up and another one gets a hard on in  this room.  Pleasure and pain.  It looked like mousse.  Chocolate mousse.  Bob.  It's got an airy consistency.  It's light and lovely.  You know, it froze up, unfortunately.  Oh, come on.  No.  I backed it up.  All right.  There we go.  Bob, now look.  Bob.  Bob.  She shits like a horse.  All right, Bob. 
[03:27:30]  You got to watch.  You got to watch.  You got to watch.  Watch the whole thing.  Watch the whole thing.  Now, turn around.  Just watch it.  Please, Bob.  Man, I got you.  You'll love it.  I got you.  Come on, Bob.  I'm with you.  Watch.  Don't turn away.  Because it's very interesting.  It's hilarious how she shits.  Yeah.  Look how she shits.  It fills up the cup so fast.  Here we go.  You got to watch.  Just watch.  What an amazing dog.  There you go.  A little lesbian action.  Watch.  Wide open.  Wait, wait, wait.  Bob.  Don't turn away.  Don't turn away. 
[03:28:00]  You're not a fan of Carvel?  What are you there, Bob?  Yeah.  It's thinny-thin shit.  What bother?  You don't bother them?  Here's a bother.  Fudgy the whale-sized dump.  Right after they shit, the asshole opened up again, and a little stringy piece went from  the asshole to the cup.  A little stringy piece. 
[03:28:30]  Oh, Bob, you're the best.  I want to thank Aaron Buzzard.  He wasn't looking close enough.  Yeah, Bob.  Bob.  Wait.  Bob.  Bob.  Bob.  Hold me here, man.  Hold me here, man.  Man.  How could you pay to get somebody to do that?  How could you not?  What are you?  Danny, could you go a little bit that way?  Come on, Bob.  There you go.  I just need the camera on Bobby.  There you go. 
[03:29:00]  What's wrong with him?  No.  What's wrong with him?  We got Danny.  Now, Bob.  I don't know how you guys could just watch that.  Bob, sit down.  There's a lot more.  You got to watch the rest, Bob.  Bob.  All right.  Hopey.  We weren't even at the best part.  Can you stop acting like my stepfather and just relax?  All right?  You're going to miss the part where all the toppings...  Hopey just said, sit down.  All right.  I'll bring you.  You want to smack me in the back of the head and call me stupid?  Bob, I'll talk to you like you're 10 years old again.  Does Bobby want little plugs for his comedy date?  Yes, I do.  Then he better sit down and look at the film. 
[03:29:30]  Don't threaten me, you asshole.  After the big log comes out, Bob.  Bob.  Yeah.  Bob, just get to the next thing.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  Let's take bets.  Get my wallet out.  You got to watch this.  How long does Bob last?  I think Bob will last because after the shit comes out...  Fuck, I got no money!  Watch...  Damn it!  Bob, watch the asshole.  Gee, that's unusual, though.  I get it!  Bob, you got to watch the stringy piece.  Like, when the asshole spits out the last piece.  Hold on.  All right. 
[03:30:00]  Here we go, Bob.  It's like peanut butter.  Are they betting on pal talk at least because I have no money today?  Fuck.  Pal talk, have fun.  How long do you think Bob will last?  Let's put him on the clock.  All right?  All right.  Why don't you bet me?  Bet me.  I bet you.  How much?  Yeah, how much?  How much, Bobby?  I bet you $6.  I like a little cute Opie.  I bet you $20.  How much, Bobby?  I like that.  I bet you $20 that you won't last past the fucking original shit in the cup scene once  you look at the asshole opening up and the last piece being spit out. 
[03:30:30]  Not with your fucking David Mammoth description.  It's almost like a fucking earthworm spitting something out while I let the asshole open up  again.  Are we betting out there in pal talk land?  Hopefully.  Here we go.  All right.  Here we go, Bob.  Just watch the asshole.  How many seconds?  How are we going to?  Someone get on the clock because I want to watch Bob's reaction.  That's way better than the clock.  All right.  You got it?  All right.  Here we go, Bob.  Concentrate.  Now, obviously, the first scene's wonderful.  There's a girl, like, you know, sucking on another girl's tit.  That's nice, right?  Yeah.  All right. 
[03:31:00]  Here we go.  All right.  Okay.  Nice.  Very nice.  Watch the asshole.  Watch.  All right.  You got to put the bucket underneath the screen.  Bob!  Did you see the asshole kind of spit the last piece out?  God damn it.  Can we hold his head?  Bob, will you let us hold your head?  Orange, yeah.  Huh?  And I don't fucking like Indian chicks either. 
[03:31:30]  Oh, that's the real problem.  Oh, yeah.  That's what really spuds them off.  There's actually a video that's...  Because you know the one girl shitting curry.  There's a video floating around the web of just people's reactions to the video.  Oh, really?  That's a great idea.  Well, add this one to the fucking...  What happened to Sammy?  Is he still around?  Oh, he's on the floor.  I got one cam now on the video.  All right.  We got to watch more, Bob.  Bob.  You keep getting past this floor, so you keep coming at the same floor.  I just want to get one on Bobby.  Don't tap out, Bob. 
[03:32:00]  You are.  I'm with you, Hope.  I'm with you.  Talk nice again.  All right.  I don't like the angry stepfather over here.  A quick plug to make everybody feel good.  Yeah, go ahead.  This Friday and Saturday, the Sweet Basil Comedy Club.  I will be appearing in Queensbury, New York.  518-792-5233.  The Saratoga Comedy Club dot com.  And I'm going to be in Jersey.  Yeah, good.  Jersey.  Now watch the video.  Uncle Vinny's.  Uncle Vinny's in Jersey.  Now, Bob, come on, because there's another... 
[03:32:30]  I'm with you.  I'm with you.  There's another scene we wanted to get to here.  All right.  Get to the scene.  You know what's coming, so just hang in there.  Yeah, hang in.  Don't look at the little gluey pieces that are sticking in the ass.  I don't like that you...  By the way, I've got to explain something.  We're not telling you the website, because then everyone's going to go there, and then we  can't do this little bit with Bobby.  Eatabullet.com.  There you go.  All right.  Here we go, Bob.  Oh, God.  Concentrate it.  Starts with a nice lesbian scene.  The girl's sucking on a tape.  I'm going to make it through the sky.  What's wrong with that?  I wish you will.  He made it seven seconds.  Seven seconds.  Let's try for 30.  All right?  Never. 
[03:33:00]  He'll never make it 30.  No.  Not with this shit like him.  He won't make it a 10.  This time, as soon as he turns around, we'll stop the tape, and we'll continue from there.  No, hold the bucket under the fucking screen right there.  It's right there.  Okay.  Wait.  No way.  Put the bucket right under the screen.  It is right there.  So he's forced to stare at it.  Hang on.  I've got to take my hat off, because my head's getting hot.  Look, it really is.  Look.  Look at his head.  It's sweating in beet red.  Oh, fucking.  You're going to pass the kidney stuff.  Hang on one second.  Give me the fucking bucket.  No, we're putting it right under the flat screen.  Really?  Are you, really?  You fucking Vietnam con fucking torturing asshole. 
[03:33:30]  Put it right there.  Oh.  All right.  Here we go.  TV.  Okay.  All right.  Here we go.  Let's go.  All right.  Let's go.  Let's watch this.  Go ahead.  I can fucking do it.  I'm going to do this.  All right.  You can do this, Bob.  I'm going to do this.  Look.  Look.  You're sucking on a tit.  Yeah.  It's easy.  I like that better.  It should make you sick.  Support.  I don't know, Mr. Fucking.  I'd pay 400 for this.  All right.  Let's go.  You should laugh at it.  It's cute.  Please get to the next scene, Bob.  Because we want to move on.  What's the next scene?  Not as bad.  It's not as bad.  Two girls, one cup, you silly goose.  It goes back to nice lesbian shit. 
[03:34:00]  There's the shit.  You can handle that.  See?  So far, so good, Bob.  Right?  All right.  Now watch.  Now they're looking like an ice cream cone.  Hang on there.  Bob, hang on there.  Bob, hang on there.  Hang on, Bobby.  Hang on, Bobby.  Bob, what the fuck is happening here? 
[03:34:30]  Uncle Vinny's Friday and Saturday.  He's got to leave.  He just walked out.  He fucking walked out.  That sound.  Oh, that was gross.  That was like, I mean, rules, man.  The part that got him.  Now you got Wednesday sound content.  He's fucking Vito Corleone playing with his grandson in the tomato. 
[03:35:00]  The girls were licking the shit in the cup.  And then the one girl was like, kind of like putting it in her mouth and then sucking it back in the way you will an ice cube.  Yeah.  And there's a little fucking brown nugget on her fucking lower lip.  Well, she's sucking it out a little bit.  Looks like she's sticking a brown tongue out.  The rate she fucking shits in that cup is stunning.  It's wonderful.  It fills it up so fast.  That's a Metamucil shit.  Yeah.  That's a great dump.  No, it is.  It is.  That's a great dump.  There's space on the garbage pail. 
[03:35:30]  How much longer on this video?  We might as well watch it.  All right, push play.  I want to see what part we're going to do.  Oh, God.  All right, he'll get past this part.  No.  Are you kidding me?  No way.  All right, she swallowed it.  All right.  Yeah.  Is that the end of the video coming up?  No, there's puking, too.  Wait, go ahead.  Keep playing it.  He won't get past this.  Right there.  You got to show it.  No way. 
[03:36:00]  This is where we're going to start it.  Where the girls are making out with...  Shit in their mouth.  Right here.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, okay.  That's what you're saying.  That's what you're saying.  All right, go back.  All right, go back.  All right, a little further back.  Right there.  Right there's good.  Right there.  Right there.  And it stops.  No, wait.  No, forward, forward, forward.  Yes, forward.  As soon as you see the tongue.  It ends with a baby bird.  As soon as you see the tongue coming out.  Right there.  Right there is good.  Okay.  Bob, come back in.  Bob, we want to make nice.  Bobby. 
[03:36:30]  Bob.  Bob, come back in.  No.  No.  Bob, come on.  I'd rather plug on a zoo.  Come on, Bob.  Come on in.  I'll use my MySpace to get people to come to my shows.  Bobby, you got to see this.  Now that you're married, you're really...  I've seen it.  Something's wrong with you.  You're like...  I don't know what's wrong when you're ever since you got married.  Oh, don't use that stupid tactic.  It doesn't work.  Come on in.  Come on in, Bob.  Please.  I wouldn't lead you the wrong way.  Yeah, you would.  You have since I've met you.  All right, Bob.  Come on, Bob.  You got to watch this.  Can somebody take this?  I don't like holding this.  I feel like I have to do my...  Danny, make sure you have them. 
[03:37:00]  Make sure you have a mic.  Okay, Bob.  Look.  Yeah, I got it.  We fast forward to a better part of the video.  Yeah, yeah.  All right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right?  I'll be able to look at it.  All right.  I'll be able to do it.  Wait, wait, wait.  Just give me one second.  I'll be able to do this.  You can do it.  I'll do it.  We're almost done.  All right.  She's smiling.  She's happy now.  Full screen now.  Okay, I got it.  It's made all done.  You're coming after me, aren't you?  No, I'm not coming after you.  All right.  This is going to be fun.  We'll have a good time.  Oh, yeah, we will.  Relax.  Oh, we're going to rumble.  I'm going to be able to do this.  All right, let's go, Bob.  All right, hang on one second.  Wait, get ready to turn around. 
[03:37:30]  Just give me a second.  All right.  You can do it.  Let's give me a second.  Come on, Bobby.  Prove your stepfather wrong.  You didn't shit in my mouth.  By the way, I didn't know about the reaction stuff.  We're going to tell people where to go for that because that's...  Okay.  Here we go.  I got to see a couple of those, by the way.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Bob, ready to go.  I'm ready.  I'm ready.  Are you going to fuck with us?  No, I got you.  Tough it up.  Hopi, will you relax?  Go ahead, Bob.  What are you getting insecure for?  Because it's radio gold.  Shut your face.  All right, let's go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Hang on.  Ready?  I'm going to count to three. 
[03:38:00]  You ready?  Yes.  I'm going to count to three, and then you hit the button.  Okay.  All right?  You're on the chair.  Wait, give him a tissue.  Jesus.  I got a tissue.  I'm good.  He's good.  He's good.  He's good.  I'm good.  Ready?  I'm going to say three, and on three we go.  Yes.  All right, here we go.  I look.  You push play.  All right.  All right, concentrate.  Do we have any Rocky music?  Oh, yeah.  We can give you a rock music.  Come on now.  Hold on.  I just want the part where it goes, dung, when she goes, win.  Dung.  Yeah, right at the end.  Right at that part.  We have dung.  Wait, put headphones on. 
[03:38:30]  Dung.  Put headphones on.  We'll give you some inspiration.  You want some chariot, some fire?  What do you need?  I need a little Rocky music.  A little Rocky?  All right.  Yeah.  Hey, Rocky, you got some Rocky for our pal?  All right, here we go.  Yeah.  All right.  There you go.  Let it kick in a little bit.  Exactly.  You tell us when to go.  Yeah.  You're feeling it.  Bob's feeling it.  I need a little bit.  All right, you're feeling it, Bob.  Come on now.  Come on, Bob.  I'm from Tiger.  You are a monster.  What do you say?  You ready?  I'm going to wait until it kicks in. 
[03:39:00]  All right.  I'm going to get you.  Oh, here we go.  All right, he's bobbing his head.  All right, here we go.  Red Sox won the World Series, baby.  You got inspiration out the ass today.  Let's go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Turn it up.  Turn it up.  How do I turn this up for about it?  Here we go.  She shits like a tiger.  Come on, Bobby.  Come on.  Yeah.  I had the tiger.  Rising up.  Rising up.  One, two, three, go. 
[03:39:30]  No, stop it.  What are you doing?  Go back.  It's a second.  Rocky don't work.  The girls are making out with wet shit in their mouths.  Rocky don't work.  Fucking rookie can't take it.  Full mouth.  Mouth.  Mouth.  Yeah.  Full of shit.  But, Bobby, you got to see the next part.  It's fucking wonderful.  It's like these girls ate, like, the biggest spoonfuls of chocolate mousse that they could. 
[03:40:00]  Both of them.  And then started open mouth kissing.  The next part you got to see.  The girls, by the way, out on the bleachers watching the show.  All wet.  Completely disgusted.  All wet.  They're completely disgusted.  They're all hot.  Turned on.  Bobby, obviously, we need another song.  What do you think?  Chariots of Fire.  No.  Final Countdown.  No.  We need an inspirational song.  I need something.  I need something.  What else is inspirational?  I don't know.  I used to know something. 
[03:40:30]  It's hard for me to say I'm sorry.  I just called to say I love you.  Oh, shit.  I don't know if the only inspiration Norton needs is a whistle.  Someone on Pal Talk.  Help us out.  Yeah, we need an inspirational song.  Like, the song.  Like, fucking.  You don't get much higher than Rocky.  No, there's a few out there.  Yeah, I know.  That is.  That made me want to jog.  Chariots of Fire?  No.  You've never ran before.  Chariots of Fire?  Inspiration.  I'll give you 20 bucks if you can make it for the next 10 seconds. 
[03:41:00]  And I don't have to give you nothing?  You don't have to give me nothing.  20 bucks for 10 seconds.  How about?  20 bucks for 10 seconds.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  I think I got it here.  20 bucks for 10 seconds.  This was very inspirational.  You might have one in?  Yeah.  How about a little ecstasy of golf for the third time today?  20 bucks for 10 seconds.  All right, Bob.  Come on, Bob.  I don't want the money.  I don't want the money.  I want you to do it.  I don't want the money.  Okay.  Nine.  If you made it 100, that'd be good.  Hold on.  I think we got it. 
[03:41:30]  I got a fucking mortgage, you asshole.  What do you think?  I'm going to get a cab right back to my apartment?  There you go.  All right, we've used this before, but this is inspirational.  And it'll bring back your youth.  Can I hear a little bit of it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  There you go.  Come on, right?  That's the free song.  That's like it.  Yeah.  What's up?  What's up?  Yeah.  Little Daniel's song didn't think he'd be able to do it.  And then... 
[03:42:00]  I had one of these girls rubbing my shoulders.  How about we play a little Don't Stop Believin'?  Don't Stop Believin', a little journey.  That's a good one, too.  Don't Stop Heavin'.  Just as we get you back.  All right, let's go.  A little journey.  Don't Stop Believin', just to get...  Not the actual song that gets you...  You know what song gets me going?  That Kill Bill song.  Which one?  That instrumental.  Oh, I have that.  Battle Without Honor.  Yes.  Oh, really?  Wait, which one?  That will get me through it.  The Green Hornet theme. 
[03:42:30]  Wait, the whistling or the...  No, not the whistling.  That's fucking going to make you want to stab myself.  I know.  That's awful.  That's awful, isn't it?  You got it?  Stop enough with the whistling.  How about some Boston?  Foreplay, long time?  No.  What are you reliving your old radio days?  It's like a V8B playlist.  Next one, Boston, and then the theme song.  Come on, Bob.  You can do it.  This is Ope.  Tough it up.  Star Wars theme.  Here we go.  Ready?  Stupid Ope.  He's got it.  He's got the one all we got.  All right, let's hear it.  We got it.  Let's hear it.  That's it.  That's it.  No, let's stop.  Wait. 
[03:43:00]  Get it back.  Get it back.  I like how you think, Bob.  I like how you think.  Let's go.  Just tell us when you're ready, though.  It's going to be ready as soon as I go one, two, three.  It's going to be ready right when that...  Right there, right?  Bob, can you promise us one thing?  You already saw the girls making out with the shit in their mouth.  Can you at least get past that part?  I'm going to try.  I'm going to try.  I'm going to try.  All right, here we go.  Because I don't take this as...  I'm going to try to get a tougher stomach.  All right, you're doing it for robertkellylive.com. 
[03:43:30]  Huh?  You're doing it for Uncle Vinny's.  No.  And Robert Kelly Live on MySpace.  Remember.  How do you know by MySpace?  All right, let's go, Bob.  Let's try to do this.  You ready?  I can do this.  I know you can, Bob.  All right, thanks, Ope.  All right, here we go.  All right, here we go.  Wait, play the song.  Someone's suggesting Eat It by Weird Al.  Adam B, Vegas.  A little louder.  Yeah, a little louder.  Come on.  Robert Kelly Live.com.  Ready?  One, two.  Almost.  That's right when it goes.  Dan, dan, dan. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah.  Ready?  Here we go.  All right.  I'm in a yellow jumpsuit.  I have a samurai sword.  Go.  All right.  All right.  You're past that.  You're good, Bob.  You're good.  You're doing it, Bobby.  Do it.  Watch it.  Watch it.  Watch it.  Wait, he's still in there.  Watch it.  It's still in there.  Don't you.  Don't you take your hand.  Hang in there, Bob.  Hang in there.  Oh, we lost.  The girl peeked the air girl's mouth. 
[03:44:30]  It is lovely.  He's leaving.  He's leaving.  I can't do it.  I don't know why it's so fucking funny to me.  It doesn't matter what you play.  I think that music helped you for a while, though.  All right.  That's like kick-ass music.  You're walking in slow motion with your friends. 
[03:45:00]  Well, we'll tell the people what Bob got through.  Bob got through the girls making out with their mouths filled with shit.  It's old hat to him now.  And then he kind of got through the part where the girl was holding the big cup filled with  shit as the other girl puked on top of it.  And then she went in for a taste.  And then he almost lasted when they were puking into each other's mouths.  Almost.  Almost.  That's where we lost you this time.  But there's a close-up of a girl on her knees.  And the other girl's doing the old fingernail.  I don't feel good.  I don't feel good.  How do you think she feels?  I think I lost all my electrolytes. 
[03:45:30]  Does anybody have a Gatorade?  Does anybody have a Gatorade?  Does anybody have a Gatorade?  I'm spitting up blood.  Really?  No.  Can you eat fucking chocolate right now?  How about we play some pot pie?  Fucking some shepherd's pie.  How about we play I Will Survive?  No.  I'm done.  I'm done.  He can't.  All right.  Just play the video.  That's bad.  All right.  Just play the video.  It's awful.  This is what you missed, though.  Just for us.  Because we, you know.  Go ahead there, Thin.  Puking in the mouth. 
[03:46:00]  Good.  Oh, it's done.  Yeah, see?  That's all right.  See?  See, Bob?  See, it's over.  All right.  That was it.  That's it.  Done.  You pretty much made it through the whole thing.  You were three seconds away from finishing.  So what do you say we just run it from the top?  No stopping.  Of course, that video.  I'll tell you what.  There's certain things that I don't like.  The asshole part.  Yeah.  I don't like the puking part.  So you don't like the video, Bob?  Well, you don't like this part right here, Bob.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Look, look.  Watch.  She fills the cup up. 
[03:46:30]  Watch.  And the fact that she's Indian.  I don't like Indians.  Watch.  She's filling the cup up.  Wait, watch.  Does this part bother you?  This is great.  I love this.  Watch the asshole at the end.  Watch my life.  Look at the string.  Of course, this is two...  Sorry.  TwoGirlsOneCup.com.  Number two, number one.  They're sharing.  The sharing is caring.  TwoGirlsOneCup.com.  Don't spell out two or one.  Hey, uh...  And then, Than...  Uh, Than, sorry.  Danny told me that on YouTube, there's a reaction to this video.  Yeah, I'm sure it's up on YouTube.  It's on a lot of the video sites that are out there. 
[03:47:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's just a very long compilation of people's reactions to this video.  Bobby should be included on that.  Yeah, can we find that?  Yeah, definitely.  Bobby should be the fucking highlights.  There's only one video of Norton jerking off.  My dick hasn't budged on this fucking silliness.  All right, here.  Is that...  That doesn't do it for you?  Wait, go...  Yeah.  Go while I large screen on this.  All right.  We'll turn you guys on to...  What?  Oh, I was gonna...  All right.  You wanna try to get the audio?  Yeah, I'll see if it's...  God, that was fucking...  What is this called so they can play along at home? 
[03:47:30]  Two Girls, One Cup, reaction...  Yeah, I just typed in reaction.  Number 10?  Oh, there's a million of them.  Yeah, there's a compilation.  Two Girls, One Cup, reaction on YouTube.  You can watch actual people watching the video.  Like we just did with Bob.  I didn't even know this was up there.  All right.  YouTube rules.  You wanna hear it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hopefully this should work.  It's not working at all.  It's not working.  Oh, there we go.  Oh, a guy turning his head.  Oh, baby. 
[03:48:00]  Oh, he's gagging.  Guy's gagging, covering his mouth.  This is what we saw with Bobby.  He's gonna fucking boot on his power book.  He looks like a fag, too.  It's just probably because there's two women...  There is just something so primal about...  Primal?  ...watching that and wanting to puke.  Like it's an instinct.  It's just you know shit is bad for you. 
[03:48:30]  Hey, you know it shouldn't be consumed.  Well, it was...  Hey, Sam, you gotta put his reaction up.  That could be a huge hit.  Just Bob Kelly's reaction to two cups, one...  Honestly...  Two girls, one cup.  When it's in the cup, it doesn't look bad.  Exactly.  Really, like visually.  Appreciate it in the choir.  It's the vis...  It does look like a big thing of chocolate ice cream.  A mousse.  It looks like yummy mousse.  It looks like a mousse shit in the cup is what it looks like.  It looks like a chocolate ice cream. 
[03:49:00]  I don't like the way she shits like a fucking savage.  She shits like a Clydesdale would shit.  It looks like a...  The one guy's just watching it laughing on the reaction.  The girl's not looking.  I want to see what happens there.  Because she's got to lose it.  This is hilarious, man.  I'm going to watch all these.  People are running out of the place.  Two girls, one cup reaction on YouTube.  There's a million of them.  That is really good.  Two girls, one cup.  You're going to love the names they come up with, though. 
[03:49:30]  Classic.  Because two cups, one girl was a bum.  They each had their own cup of shit.  No one cared.  One girl, two cups of shit.  She licked it.  No one cared.  She did a prop joke where it was an oldie time telephone.  She put the shit up to one ear and talked into the other one.  Can you please connect me to 215?  Two girls, one cup.  Also, they're saying bestreactions.com.  Yeah.  All right, Bob. 
[03:50:00]  Oh, this is the audio of the planes colliding.  I don't know.  Oh, that's where we were.  That's the 72 mic.  Possible traffic off your 11 o'clock and a half a mile westbound at 1,100.  That's the mic.  Good traffic.  Republic Tower.  We have a mayday, mayday, mayday.  We have a collision.  We are four or five miles to the east.  We need immediate landing instructions.  All right, use that, please.  Four three, four five zero.  Start over four three, four five zero.  Four five zero.  Proceed direct to the airport.  And if you're able, I'll give you a transmonica. 
[03:50:30]  Squawk seven, seven zero zero.  Seven seven zero zero.  We have a little collision.  We are still under control.  But we'll let you know.  Okay, I understand.  What about the other guy?  Didn't he call?  He's busy.  Probably eating shit out of a cup.  Wasn't very bad, though.  The guy kind of kept his cool there.  Those guys are always cool under pressure, man.  He's talking fast, but it wasn't like...  Plane hit plane. 
[03:51:00]  Holy shit.  Just puking.  You're a fucking classic, Bobby.  I didn't think we were going to get any puking out of you today.  I thought we were going to be human beings for once.  No, that was great.  The line of the day is brought to you by BodogFantasy.net.  It's over.  The show's quick, huh?  The one site on the web that offers scouting and stats, live scoring, and personal customization.  Yes, it does.  And it's absolutely free to fantasy football fans everywhere. 
[03:51:30]  BodogFantasy.net.  Check it out if you're playing fantasy football this season.  BodogFantasy.net.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  This chick's going to have to retire by 15, man.  That body's not going to be kind to her anymore.  Still have a cunt lip in each sock.  That's a great line.  Yeah. 
[03:52:00]  You make me so happy, Bob.  Bob rules.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  What kind of milk do you have in the regular?  1% low-fat.  That's good.  Very good.  You take care of the 99%.  Let's get the Rob Bartlett plug out of the way.  Rob?  Seven Angels Theater, November 10th.  Yes. 
[03:52:30]  Whatabury, Connecticut.  RobShow.com.  Are you going to be passing any stones at that show?  Hopefully, I'll be bringing the passed stones with me.  That's great.  Hand them out to the other, like picks.  A little show-and-tell.  Like, you know.  Show-and-tell.  You can buy one.  You'll sign them.  I'll sign it, right.  Like signed rice.  Yeah.  All those little things you wear around your neck.  I got a little Asian-laden autographs on your fucking kidney stones.  And I apologize.  I didn't mean to drop them on the floor.  I just got nervous.  No, it's fine.  That's fine.  I got really nervous. 
[03:53:00]  Eight hours of agony, and you treat it like this.  Yeah, just throw it around.  Like, it's poker chips.  Thank you.  It's robertkellylive.com.  Yeah.  I'll be at Uncle Vinny's Friday and Saturday night.  It's in New Jersey.  You seem surprised by that.  Yeah, because I actually haven't said it.  Just to let you know.  Than just handed me, remember to say the state.  Than helped you out.  The other side of the show where you got a lot of, like, New York and Jersey people listening.  Right.  You just said Uncle Vinny's.  Yeah, Uncle Vinny's.  You know where it is.  Thanks for helping me out, guys.  877-862-5384. 
[03:53:30]  Come on down.  And you can thank us for all the weight you lost today.  Wow.  Yeah, liquid.  How much did you really puke?  Dude, I...  Whatever he had in him was gone.  I didn't...  Yeah.  I had diarrhea all yesterday, so I'm kind of glad.  God.  So do those girls.  It's just awful.  I wish I had a...  I'll show you the video one time of the chick shitting into a toilet.  And the toilet has a hose under it that goes into a face mask over an Asian guy's mouth. 
[03:54:00]  And you can see him, like, swallowing everything and spells from all these different girls.  I've got some gems for Bob.  That's heinous.  Come on.  Yeah.  I got some gems, Bob.  All right.  Let's...  We'll have to bring one of those in.  All right.  Yeah.  Photo on fantasy.net.  Here's your line of the day.  Here comes...  Poe getting my truck.  Poe getting my truck.  The line of the day.  Thank you.  Please. 
[03:54:30]  But they must hate, like, that instant they get shot and just go, oh, man.  I could have had a minute.  Yeah.  Cool.  Yes.  Rob.  A gold star.  I got line of the day.  Congratulations, Rob.  Actually, Obie gets the gold stars.  I get the sparkly unicorns.  You'll have to think up something else.  Can I get the green rainbow?  You get rainbow.  I was going to go rainbow.  A little too gay. 
[03:55:00]  I get a cup of...  I get the cup of shit.  That's taken.  Yeah.  Then I get...  He pours it in my mouth and I puke on him.  You really power puke.  Yeah.  I just can't take that.  You're a great puker, man.  Well, what is it?  Because, I mean, it's gross, obviously, but I can look at it.  It's the...  It's certain...  It's the asshole muscle.  Oh, that's what pushed you over the edge?  I don't like how it opens, like, an octopus's mouth.  Ugh.  But why does it make you react like that?  Like, it's shocking, obviously. 
[03:55:30]  The asshole muscle is Kenny.  We call him Kenny.  I just don't get it.  Like, some people can look at that shit and they're reacting like, holy shit.  All those kids have to turn away.  Yeah, there's certain things I remember...  There's something so wrong about it.  When I was...  The first time I started banging this...  We used to bang this local whore.  She was...  I think she was retarded.  She was like 30...  Oh, that helps the story.  She was like...  That makes it okay.  She was like 38.  By the way, she wasn't a whore. 
[03:56:00]  She was retarded.  Well, you know what?  They have some sense.  My God, Jesus.  She knows not to put a hand in a fire.  She should not to fuck eight 15-year-olds in a bus.  Holy crap.  Can we do...  Can we do...  Forget it.  Redo line of the day.  Yeah, there you go.  I...  Well, she...  Yeah, I remember...  They were all fucking her on this bus.  And then it was my turn.  And she was standing up.  And...  Oh, God.  I was fucking her.  And then...  I don't know what happened to her pussy.  But it just started shooting out. 
[03:56:30]  Like, somebody turned...  You know when you first turn on a tub?  Those old paw tubs?  Yeah.  It just shot up.  What was shit?  Water.  Something came out of her pussy.  Yeah, she was a squirter, I guess.  No, it wasn't...  I don't know if it was...  It was the other guy's cum.  Oh, God.  I just went in.  There was 15 guys' cum.  Oh, fuck.  That's disgusting.  Just...  Ever since then, I've had a very weak stomach.  Would you take a cream pie?  Like, if you... 
[03:57:00]  I don't know what a cream pie is, my friend.  Like, a cream pie is when a guy fucks a pussy or an ass.  And then you open your mouth under it.  And they leak...  The girl leaks the cum into your mouth.  All right.  Did you just ask me if I'd swallow a man's cum?  I wouldn't do that if you take a cream pie.  I wouldn't do that if you put it in a fucking sherbet dish.  And some shaved lemon skin on it.  No, you asshole.  Why would I drink guys' cum from an ass?  But it's out of an asshole.  But it's an asshole, Bob.  She pushes it over you and it bubbles out.  I've seen a video.  It's disgusting.  It's like we'll just bubble out. 
[03:57:30]  The cum's almost defeated.  Like, all right, all right, where do you want me?  That's why I love Norton.  He really makes...  You would never be able to talk about this shit...  No.  ...if he wasn't here.  He brings a certain...  Je ne sais quoi.  I don't know.  He gets away with it, too.  So we don't consider him a homo.  Somehow we don't consider him a homo.  Oh, no.  I would never do that.  Never.  I've seen it with chicks doing it.  I would never take a fucking load like that.  Of course not.  Yeah, I know.  I was asking if you would.  You can't even have a guy in the room with you.  Oh, by the way, Matt LaFaugh from Queensbury. 
[03:58:00]  Queensbury?  Yeah, he's a regular.  He writes,  Meanwhile, at this moment,  that girl that you were talking about,  she's saying,  I used to fuck this fat guy.  I think he was retarded.  That was a good line.  From Greensboro.  He'll be at Sweet Basil's with Jimmy.  Oh, Matt's from Queensbury.  The Sweet Bables.  That's Matt.  Because Matt's going to come by and say hi to you, Jimmy.  You're going to go,  Oh, you're Matt from Queensbury.  Queensbury.  The Friday Saturday.  LaFaugh.  All right, let's get the fuck out of here.  Bye, guys.  Later. 
[03:58:30]  Thank you for listening,  and we will see you tomorrow.  Now, why do we do this?  Why do we wait and wait and say,  Turn the fucking mics off,  and let's be done with this.  Spoken my last word.  Thanks for having me in.  It was good to be back.  Don't we have, like,  a guest pitch meeting or some shit?  I wish we could say the same, Bob. 
[03:59:00]  You didn't like me in, O?  I didn't like the first seven days of your appearance.  Really?  Came on straw in the last day.  We're still on.  Don't let him fool you.  That's good.  Thanks, O.  Thanks for your support.  Your support always really does give me a lot of fans.  I'd probably get more fans if I didn't come on this show.  More off-the-air stuff.  It really is.  I've just gotten to the point where I really can't.  You bring open mics in here,  you give him more support than me,  you fucking loser.  Then every once in a while you throw in, 
[03:59:30]  oh, he's funny, though.  Every once in a while you throw in,  ah, he went to a show,  Rob's really funny,  when you know people aren't listening.  Fucking loser.  Beat you up for hours and give you one bone every once in a while.  I come in here,  say some great lines.  Who was in the audience for your Comedy Central?  You really did come down.  Did you watch my wedding?  No.  It was too late.  What do you mean too late?  10.45.  That's too late when you wake up early.  Did you watch the Red Sox last night?  No.  What time did you go to bed?  Last night I was really tired from the weekend,  so you're going to laugh.  Eight o'clock. 
[04:00:00]  That's rare for me.  Did you watch my wedding, Anthony?  You know what?  I couldn't get on fucking line for it.  Really?  You missed the fucking...  Did your wedding on line?  Yeah.  He goes to Hawaii,  and we all sit at home.  We all sit at...  What am I doing?  I'm not even talking into a microphone.  We all sit at home and watch it online.  But this is the part of the show  where we're making believe we're not on the air.  Yeah, so the mic could be down a little bit.  Down a little bit.  You just get like ambient background noise.  Yeah, like you're off back a little bit.  Background noise.  So you didn't get on?  You can make yourself sneak up on yourself.  I couldn't get on.  I kept clicking, 
[04:00:30]  and then there was nothing to click on.  I clicked on some other friggin'  some Hawaiian woman doing a hula  to test to make sure it worked.  Yeah.  And it worked,  but then I couldn't find fucking Blobby.  Hey, Blobby.  Blobby.  When I get married,  I'm going to actually invite you to the wedding.  Yeah, well, if I had Opie money,  I'd fucking invite you too.  Well, it's going to be probably in Philly.  You're going to get married in Philly?  Yeah, that's where my fiancée is from.  My fiancée.  I hate that, by the way.  I like being engaged, 
[04:01:00]  but I hate the,  oh, this is my fiancée.  Oh, wait till you write the day you get married  and you go back to the hotel.  Yeah.  And she goes,  this is my wife.  Wait till you get the ad out.  She's going to say that?  No, when you go,  when you go,  this is my wife.  Did he say that?  That would be odd.  Great.  Thanks, Bobby.  Thanks, Bobby.  This is my husband.  It's weird, right?  This is my,  oh, it's weird.  It's cool, though, right?  Yeah, it is cool.  It lasts for a couple days.  And then you're like,  shit, this didn't solve anything, right?  No, you're back on Craigslist,  ordering pizzas, 
[04:01:30]  fucking jerking off three times a day.  Bobby, I was at your taping.  Yes.  And I ran right up to you at the end.  Yes.  I stayed around to say that it was amazing.  I invited you.  I never invite him,  because I know he won't show up.  Right.  I don't show up to shit.  I know.  You don't leave Long Island.  No, I don't.  You're like your own house arrest.  I'm afraid of the bridges and the water.  Let me tell you the observation, too.  Everyone was very excited  at the end of your taping.  They thought you did an amazing job.  Thanks, man.  And you kicked the other guy's ass,  and he was pretty funny, though.  I don't know his name, 
[04:02:00]  but he was pretty funny.  I don't know his name either.  He was from Minnesota?  Yeah, well, he had the map of Minnesota.  Yeah, it was, right?  Which I don't like.  I hate when they do that.  He was pretty funny, but...  Prop coming.  You blew him off this day as a boat.  Yeah, I was glad you were there.  You and your...  girlfriend at the time.  She was a girlfriend.  Yeah, I think so.  She wasn't a fiancé.  Yeah.  Not yet.  I was real happy when you asked her to marry you.  Yeah, I'm very happy about this.  Oh, yeah.  She's a smoker.  You keep her.  Well, she's more than that, though. 
[04:02:30]  Yeah, she's a great girl.  She's got a good personality,  down to earth.  She's got a cool family, and...  Keeps me sane.  And she's an 11.  She's smart, and she adores you.  Yeah, she's an 11.  You can't even...  You know when your friend's girlfriend is hot,  and you can't look at her  when you talk to her?  She notices that, by the way.  You can't...  You know what I mean?  She goes,  Bobby never looks at me.  Can't.  Why?  Because she's so hot.  You know what I mean?  Oh, God damn it.  You're so weird.  I would never want to, like...  Dude, your chick is hot.  Your wife's hot,  but I can look at her.  But I don't want to ever, like,  ever have that thought. 
[04:03:00]  You know, like,  she's really...  Like, Lindsay's eyes  almost look fake.  What color are her eyes?  Um...  Like, crystal magic blue?  What do they call it?  I was trying to think  what color blue to say.  Yeah, they're really nice blue eyes.  Yeah, they're crazy blue.  It's like, uh,  Caribbean water blue.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, you know...  Opie had her built, uh,  years ago.  You and him put a bra on your head?  Took all the Opie money.  Opie fortune. 
[04:03:30]  That's a weird science reference.  See, I'm good.  I'm that damn good.  But, uh, no, Bobby.  See, I'm trying to be serious with you.  Yeah, we are.  You bring a lot of laughs to the show.  Thank you, buddy.  And the puking thing,  I know it's like, kind of like,  you know,  smash the watermelon Gallagher type stuff,  but it's still terrific, though.  He's a prop with his own puke.  I like it because  one day you're going to  actually get me through this.  I won't have a gag reflex.  Someday.  Yeah.  You'll learn.  And that's when I'll go  right to another radio show.  And I'll be honest,  I thought that bit was played out,  but then that guy... 
[04:04:00]  See, we take you inside the show  after the show.  Guy on his feedback goes,  you got to show Bobby  two girls in one cup.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's give it a shot.  There you go.  I'm a team player, Ope.  So.  How long has it been  since I've been in?  Two months?  Yeah, about that.  Yeah, where have you been?  Besides the married thing.  You weren't away that long.  Were you?  Yeah.  How long were you in Hawaii?  Two weeks.  Wow.  Did you surf?  No, I went in the water  with turtles.  And then I found out  that tiger sharks,  their favorite food 
[04:04:30]  is a turtle.  I looked at the mirror naked  and I was like,  I'm not going back in.  What do you do with the turtles?  Do you ride them?  You can't touch them.  Supposedly,  in some places,  you could actually hold on  to their shell  and they'll give you a ride.  Really?  Yeah, I swear to God.  Swear to God.  Well, if you type in...  There's a way of holding  on to their shell  and they'll propel you  along for a while.  No shit.  Yeah.  No, they told us.  How big were they?  They were like  the size of little Jimmy.  What do you mean?  They were like big.  There was one  that had all 
[04:05:00]  the barnacles on its  fucking fins.  It was huge.  Right.  Why didn't you surf?  Supposedly,  every 10 feet,  there's somebody  willing to teach you  how to surf.  I'm afraid of sharks.  And I don't like  those fucking...  My girl wanted to surf  and I told her she couldn't  because of those  fucking guys  who teach her how...  The locals...  You know what I'm talking about.  Those guys.  You look out  and she's out there  and he's got his hand  on her ass.  Dude,  you've got to come back.  We bring it up  every once in a while.  You go on vacation  as a fat slob,  white,  because you've been 
[04:05:30]  in New York  in the middle of winter  for eight months  and you go down  to one of these places  and these guys  are ripped,  been tanning  for 350 straight days  and they hit on your women  right in front of you  and you feel like a loser.  They've got curly black hair  but it's a little blonde  because of the sun.  They've got abs  not because they're working out  just because they haven't  eaten in three weeks.  And then you're getting  pissed off  and she's like,  oh, he's just being nice.  Why are women  so fucking naive?  Really,  why are they so naive? 
[04:06:00]  He's just being nice.  He had his hand  on your asshole.  You were standing up  on the board  only because his fist  was clutching your cunt.  And you're on the beach  just raging.  Just fucking raging.  You don't want to fight  one of them too  because you know  they know that  island fucking jiu-jitsu.  Yeah.  It looks like  they break dancing  but they can kick you  in the face  with a fucking toe.  Alright.  Where are you going  for your honeymoon?  I don't know.  I was thinking 
[04:06:30]  maybe Hawaii.  Don't go to Hawaii.  Why?  Too commercialized?  Well, there's one island.  Too many people?  Yeah, well,  big Hawaii is  like fucking crack.  Wouldn't this be done  in a phone call?  Yeah, we're just hanging.  Sorry, Jesus.  Just fucking with you.  We know where  you're getting married.  There's no...  I ain't fucking  getting married.  I ain't getting married again.  Fuck that noise.  Never?  Never again.  What if they do it  in the woods  and you're Robin Hood?  What kind of fucking  drugs 
[04:07:00]  in the woods?  How about you have  like a commitment ceremony  though?  Like something.  Am I gay?  Commitment ceremony.  Like do the old  like Goldie Hawn  and some of these  couples that don't get married  they have like  some kind of  commitment ceremony.  That's some kind of compromise  on somebody's part  to make it seem  like you're married  or more like you're married.  Fuck it.  You should do that.  Done.  You should whittle her  a ring  out of some wood.  Whittle.  Go whittle 
[04:07:30]  your fucking ass.  I ain't gonna whittle  a ring.  God.  I'm done with marriage.  Come on, D'Artagnan.  Give it one shot.  That's it.  It's not baseball.  You don't get up there  for three fucking  swats at the ball.  You're done.  I fucking struck out.  Ain't doing it again.  Never.  Ain't going through  that crap again.  Really?  Yeah.  Are you in love?  I like being able to  yeah but I need to get  my fucking pool.  Oh my God.  I need to get my  built in pool  and my fucking  I don't want to be 
[04:08:00]  handing money  to anybody else.  The first one  got a nice chunk.  Believe me.  So you're  getting a pool?  I'm a selfish  materialistic douche.  No, I'm just  not getting married.  You want a kid?  No.  Ugh.  Worse than a wife  would be a kid.  Yeah but I  tell Annie  he would be  a great father though.  I'd probably be  the bestest  father ever  but some poor 
[04:08:30]  little fucking  bastard ain't  ever going to  find that out  because I  can't stand  children.  They're loud  obnoxious  and they embarrass you  and you can't  do anything.  But for the most part  I can't stand  other people's kids  but I could stand  like my brother's  kids and my sister's  kids and I'm thinking  my own kids  that would be  really cool.  Yeah you could  leave your uncle  your nieces and nephews.  So your thinking's  not that off.  I mean you don't  like other people's  kids but wouldn't you  really like your own  kids?  Do you know a couple 
[04:09:00]  of years of your  life at least  at least a couple  of years of your  life are completely  fucked.  They're completely  dedicated to taking  care of a child.  You can't go on  these fucking wild  vacations.  You can't just  spur the moment  go I want to go  to fucking Bahamas  or I want to do  this.  No you can't.  You have a fucking  kid that has to  fucking be near a  tit all the time.  I get that side of  it but don't you  think it'll also  bring you some  enjoyment into your 
[04:09:30]  life?  Maybe on my  fucking deathbed  I'll be going  I wish I could  have passed on  myself to other  it's a selfish  thing.  It's like the world  needs a fucking  an heir to my  fucking throne.  No but as you're  living you don't  think they would  enrich your life in  any way?  No I'd rather have  my life enriched by  just people I'm  fucking around that  die around the same  time I do.  I don't want people  around that are  going to be around 
[04:10:00]  long after I'm  gone and forgotten.  Fuck them.  I want this whole  world to blow up  the day I die.  I want Armageddon  to happen.  That's how I want  to go.  A big media hits  there's nothing  left.  You want our  generation to be  the last generation.  That's it.  Man.  I don't like the  idea that business  is going to go as  usual when I ain't  around.  Fucking stock market  is going to open and  close.  Fucking trains are  going to run.  People are going to  go to work.  Fuck that shit.  The sun's going to  come up and go down  well over a million  times after you're 
[04:10:30]  gone.  I don't want that.  I want a fracture in  the planet that's  going to send everyone  off into space going  oh Anthony.  That does piss me off  to a point.  After you're gone oh  man there'll be lots  of sunny days for  others.  Fuck those people.  Tweeting birds,  changes of seasons as  your fucking jaw is  doing the drop.  It's horrible.  But not this wasn't  about Bob Kelly.  It's about Bobby.  And showing Bob some  love.  Well Bob's got love. 
[04:11:00]  He's married.  Your childhood stories  bothered me today.  I don't know why.  You didn't like them?  No they were good  radio.  Yeah.  It was really sad  especially when you  said what did you  say first time you  were yelled at like  that was you were in  shock.  Oh yeah.  When he hit me.  Or the first time he  hit you or yelled at  you like you had no  concept of that.  That bothered me for  some reason.  I think the mom laughing  at the I love you too  mom was pretty much  that you know you  could have become a 
[04:11:30]  stand up or went up  on a tower with a  high powered rifle.  Both.  And where is your  mom?  She's dead.  How long ago?  No I'm joking.  She's in Boston.  She's still there?  Yeah she's funny.  Put that in your act.  She's in Boston.  But do you guys have  you been hanging out  your whole lives?  Well yeah.  I had it wrong man.  I thought like your  parents like.  I got a huge Irish  Catholic family.  Was she down for your  taping?  No.  No they didn't come  down for that.  Why?  It's a big day for you.  They're ashamed of him. 
[04:12:00]  Um no it wasn't that  big of a day.  You know that my mom's  never been to any of  my stuff.  Why?  Not a one.  I've met Anthony's  mom.  Yeah.  But I've never met  anybody from your  family except your  brother.  My dad couldn't get  enough of this career  that Ant and I have  been doing but my mom  not a one.  She's proud of me.  Yeah.  She hasn't been to  one live show.  She hasn't been to  any of the tapings.  She's never seen this  studio.  She never saw any W.  She never saw K-Rock. 
[04:12:30]  Not a one.  Really?  Never saw us in  Boston.  I think your parents  came up to Boston  right Ant?  Yeah a few times.  Right?  Fuck yeah.  Not a one.  Yeah.  No.  Is Roland here?  I don't know where  my uh I don't know  where my real dad is  though.  I don't know where  that guy is.  No?  A Vietnam vet.  That would have  been cool stories.  Wait when was the  last time you saw  him?  I told you about  years and shit  and fucking.  So he was part of  your life off and  on?  Yeah.  In ten years 
[04:13:00]  I haven't talked  to him.  He gave me a  thousand dollars.  What happened  the last time  you saw him?  I don't know.  I think my sister  needed a kidney  transplant.  She was gonna die  and then he went  in to get tested.  To get tested.  Were you in  contact before now  or you had to  fine him for this?  We were in  contact and then  he uh found out  he had hep C  or some shit.  No shit.  I think he got  mad and then he  gave my sister a  letter like you  missed my birthday  and I think he  you know what  happened?  Then he got  like you know  what fuck this 
[04:13:30]  because we were  kind of around  on holidays  or some shit.  I think he uh  thought we were  just around for  that hundred dollar  fucking birthday  card.  Huh.  You know what I  mean?  So so then  that's it.  Ten years ago  that was it.  Gave my sister a  letter like look  I'm done with  you blah blah blah  and then I you  know I had a  stick up for my  sister.  So then he's  like I'm done  with you now.  But he never  said it to me.  Now he never  sent me anything  I just said  fuck it.  So he doesn't  know how famous  you are?  Well no he doesn't  I don't have  I've never heard 
[04:14:00]  from my guy.  Because ten years  ago you weren't  that famous yet.  You were on your  way.  I moved to New York  I had five jobs  and I quit them  all to move to  New York.  He's had a C on  TV by now?  Maybe.  Wow that's fucked up.  I don't even know  if he's alive.  That's fucked up.  Yeah.  You should find  him.  How?  That empowerment  protective.  Well you know  what I actually  sent him an email  there's this website  you can go to  I forget what  it's called  and you can  look up anybody  anybody  and for no fee  and it comes up  with all their  information  and you can 
[04:14:30]  send them  they won't  give you the  email but  you can send  them a message  and I sent  them a message  that I was  getting married.  Wow.  And I have  never heard  back.  And you go  back to that  website  and it will  say his  message will  be there.  Do they at  least tell you  that he got  the message?  You have to  go back to  that website.  You can tell  if something  was read.  Nope.  You have to  go back to  that website  and his  message will  come up  under your  message.  Wow.  It's never  come up.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  You get a 
[04:15:00]  private detective  and a social  security number  and you can't  find him like  that.  You don't  care.  He's a cool  guy but I  don't want to  fuck up his  life.  It's kind of  like I don't  want to fuck  up his life.  You know what  I mean?  You know what?  You got to  get closure on  it.  You got to  make amends  with it because  what will happen  is you'll find  out later on  that he ended  up dying and  then there's  going to be  a little part  of you that's  always going  to think.  You know?  I'm just  saying for  you.  I think  Bobby's at  peace. 
[04:15:30]  I'm just  telling you.  You think  you are  until you  do.  I think  that if  he die  yeah maybe  but I don't  want to  fuck up  his life  either.  But you  know what?  All of a  sudden I'm  back in his  life.  It's his  choice.  I think his  wife might have  been involved  in it too.  He has a  daughter with  her and she  might have been  like you know  what?  These kids  they never  do this and  that.  They only  show up  for it.  He was  like you  know what?  Fuck this.  In 10  years you're  in a different  place.  He's in a  different place.  He'd be  maybe close  to dying.  You just  have that 
[04:16:00]  little bit  of before.  Makes  all the  difference  in the world.  I'm telling  you.  We're not  supposed to  acknowledge  that we're  still in  the air but  Goober from  Whackbag writes  is the website  called I  miss my  daddy dot com.  Actually they  have that  website Goober.  What is the  website?  Because there's  actually people  wondering.  For me it  would be.  Because they  got some  lost people  they want to  find.  I miss my  daddies.  What's the  website or you  don't want to  give it out?  I don't know  it.  I forget it.  I really do.  I give it out.  But you can  just Google that.  You can people  search them all  over.  There's like 
[04:16:30]  millions of  them.  Just boom  boom boom.  Were you hoping  your dad was  going to respond  to your email?  I was just  throwing that  out just to  see if you  wanted to.  Because it  was on the  internet.  That live  Maui webcast.  It's what's  that my dad  is not around  for it.  Because when  he was alive  I was in a  bad place.  Right.  And I was  just not  happy.  Not a happy  person.  So it kind  of sucks  that he's not  going to see  that I turned  it all around.  Did he know  you and your  girl were  going through  trouble? 
[04:17:00]  Oh yeah.  He was like  yeah yeah.  He was like  he thought I  should have  walked way  before I did.  Really?  Oh yeah.  That's weird.  Oh yeah.  That sucks.  What's cool  is I talk  about him  in such  a way  that Lindsay  every once  in a while  I go oh  that's something  your dad  would say.  Like she  knows him.  So I'm  like I  think I  did a  pretty good  job  kind of  explaining  what kind  of guy  he was.  Yeah.  My brother  has a lot 
[04:17:30]  of videotapes  on him so  I can probably  sit down  with her  and show  her a video  of him.  You should  put something  together.  Yeah.  That's the  biggest bummer.  But then you  get the people  how do you  know he  doesn't know?  How do  how do you  know he  doesn't know  that you're  happy?  That is weird  though dude.  What if you  I mean  I mean  you're so  fucked if you  say that  doesn't exist  and then it  does and you  get up there  and then you're  fucked.  Because he's  like you  dummy I was  watching you  the whole 
[04:18:00]  time.  Yeah but  you know  what I  want to  know.  Either way.  I don't  want to be  wondering well  yeah maybe.  What the hell  is that?  It's your  dad.  Time?  Text.  What was my  dad?  Daddy?  Oh god.  Daddy?  Daddy?  All right.  Yeah but  that's the  bummer about  that's why  I asked that  because you  were probably  hoping that  he would  have some  kind of  reaction to  the fact  you were  getting  married.  I figured  he would  watch it  on the  internet. 
[04:18:30]  I imagine  he did.  Maybe he  did.  You know  what I  tried to  find out  who  watched  it but  the guy  deleted  the log.  But I  tried to  find out  who was  there.  Because I  did send  out  you know  I sent  of course  you guys  I sent  you invitations.  I tried to  watch.  Yeah and I  said  couldn't get  it on the  internet.  I wasn't  fucking dead  in heaven.  Apparently they  could get the  internet up there  according to you.  All the guys  at the cellar  were watching it  trashing me 
[04:19:00]  the whole  time.  Which was  fantastic.  You were  stupid to  do that.  You know  what?  If I didn't  give you the  invitation  to any of  these guys  they would  have been  like you're  an asshole.  I had to  take that  chance.  And I  think it's  funny dude.  I wish I  recorded them.  It was  Nick DiPaolo,  Norton,  Colin Quinn,  and Gnome from  The Cellar and  a bunch of  other comics.  Now you  expect those  guys to be  asses watching  your wedding on  the comics.  On the web,  right?  I expect you  guys to  fucking.  Did anyone  give you a  reaction that 
[04:19:30]  kind of shocked  you?  Like wow  that was  pretty cool  or maybe  away from  the gang  like dude  I know  you're going  to hear that.  When Dane  called me up  he was like  let me tell  you something  man.  I just  watched your  wedding.  It was the  most amazing  thing I've  ever seen.  It was  beautiful man  and I'm so  proud of you  and you know  what?  I fucking  can't do  this.  That was the  corniest shit  I've ever  seen.  And then  he goes  butterflies?  You  fucking  moron.  What?  That was  your wedding  song?  No we 
[04:20:00]  released  26  butterflies.  Why 26?  What did  that symbolize?  That's how  much I can  afford.  I couldn't  afford 50.  Did he  give everyone  like butterfly  nets?  No.  At the end  there was a  box.  I'd rather  light a candle  together.  Let me tell  you how  anticlimactic  it was.  These butterflies  were frozen  for like the  day so they  wouldn't die  and then they  were hot from  being under a  tree and then 
[04:20:30]  I opened the  box and there  was like like  three of them  were just like  paralyzed and  there was a  dead one.  I had to take  my fucking  index finger  and smoosh  the dead  one underneath  the cotton.  What are you  throwing in the  air?  Look honey.  We did.  We had to  throw a couple  of them in  the air like  to get them  out of their  coma that  they've been  in.  This is very  anticlimactic.  Did they just  flop to the  sand or did  something fly  away?  Well the  original ones  kind of flew  out a little  bit but they're  gone.  And then there  was a couple  that were just  in the box and  we had to like  shake them up and  kind of warm  them. 
[04:21:00]  And then there  was just a dead  one I had to  push underneath.  It was very  anticlimactic.  And they fell  right to the  ground.  A few of them  just fell.  These stories of  alienation,  sadness,  and regret were  brought to you  by Bodog  Fantasy.  Thank you  Stig.  Getting married  without the  family though  was great.  Was it great?  Dude.  You married  Who was the  closest person  there?  Nobody.  It was just  you two?  What about her 
[04:21:30]  family?  You got to  think her  family.  Her mom's  too sick,  dude.  They couldn't  even go.  I was telling  Nick DiPaolo  this the other  day, her mom  is very sick.  She basically  sits at the  kitchen table  and smokes  and she can't  move.  They actually  had to put  tinfoil over  half the table  because she  would fall  asleep with  a cigarette  in her hand  on the table.  So her father  just put tinfoil  over the table.  Oh shit.  And Nick DiPaolo  goes, you should  fucking put  gasoline. 
[04:22:00]  No shit.  Yeah, they  couldn't make  it.  But let me  tell you  something.  We woke  up that  day, went  to some  chick's  house, $65  got a  license, went  to the beach,  hired a  Hawaiian to  blow into a  fucking shell.  A conch shell?  Yeah, right at the  beginning.  See, we want to  do something like  that and then you  kind of start  realizing, and no  offense to you,  but it makes  sense, I guess,  but then you  start feeling,  oh God, this is  pretty goddamn  selfish.  Nope, dude. 
[04:22:30]  For everyone  that you would  want to travel  and stuff.  Nobody.  Because to you,  it's like, this  is cool, but  everyone else  is like, fuck  man, I got to  take four days  off from work  and got to  bring kids.  You know how  happy people were  that they didn't  have to get up  and go to a,  nobody wants to  go to a wedding.  Everybody watched  it, they were  there, they saw  it, they could  watch it again,  they all getting  DVDs.  Nobody wants to  go to a fucking  wedding.  I went to a  wedding around  Christmas once, I  think it might  have been  Christmas Eve.  And I'm like, 
[04:23:00]  what the, you  selfish motherfucker,  do I care about  you this much?  The only people  that like weddings  are the fucking  two people that  get married.  And yeah, and  it was like, it  was, or, or  Christmas, one of  these, it was  right around a  holiday where it's  like, are you  fucking kidding me?  And it was because  that's the only time  they get the wedding  hall.  Oh, it's every part  of it, the church  is at a wedding,  parking, going to  the reception hall,  waiting for them to  come in, sitting at  that stupid table  with people you  don't know, then  there's the dance,  and then the other  dance, and then the 
[04:23:30]  father dance, and then  the fucking chicken  dance, and then the  fucking dumb food  comes out, and then  you eat, and then  there's all these  drunks, and you're  just waiting for that  moment where you go,  are you ready?  Yeah, I'm ready,  let's get the fuck  out of here.  And then it takes  20 minutes to say  goodbye to these  fucking assholes.  That's why we're  trying to figure out  what we can do  different, so it's  not like that, like  a little tradition, but  more of like a  party.  You know what I  mean?  A celebration.  Yeah.  That's the thing  to try to figure  out.  What was your  wedding song? 
[04:24:00]  I don't know, I  think it was the  Hawaiian guy blown  into a fucking  thump shot.  I don't think we  have one.  But the funny part  about my wedding is  that when you watch  the video, it does  look like a really  beautiful wedding,  like the ocean's in  the background, and  we're in a circle of  flowers, and this  Hawaiian dude, and  the sun's coming  down.  I would get married  like that in a  second, with maybe a  few people around.  That would be  perfect for me.  Well, what you  don't see is that  every beach in  Hawaii is public, so  right behind the  camera was a fat 
[04:24:30]  American family.  I'm not even  kidding.  Just playing in the  sand.  Just staring at me  the whole time.  Just this fat  family, this fat  guy who kept  wanting to cross  the camera shot,  and then there was  another marriage  going on down the  beach.  We had cropped  everything out.  That's hilarious.  That was fucking  ridiculous.  But it was a good  time, and you're  done.  Right when you're  married, it's over.  We went back, we  had dinner, we  fucking fucked.  When did you get  to the fuck?  Oh, right.  Oh, right after  dinner, which I  think should be  opposite.  I think you should  fuck right when he 
[04:25:00]  says, I do, you  kiss the bride.  Yeah.  You should go in  the limo and  fuck and get it  out of the way.  And then eat like  a pig, so then  when you have all  the gas, you don't  have to worry  about it.  Oh, it was a  mess.  Or if you're  looking a little  bloated or  something.  Oh, it was a  mess.  Well, in your  case, a lot  bloated.  That was a good  one.  I started  We're trying to  have a little  serious conversation.  Somebody did that  one.  It was a good  one.  They said they  should throw me  back into the  water.  Yeah. 
[04:25:30]  You should  definitely fuck  right when you're  done.  I do, and then  stick it in there  and get it over  with.  Sex life better  or worse after  marriage?  Sex life was  actually better.  For two weeks?  It's been better,  but I'm sure it's  going to go downhill  again because of my  issues, not hers.  I'm a fucking  idiot.  She's awesome, by  the way.  She's a cool chick,  man.  She's cool.  Why do you think  she puts up with  you?  Huh?  Why do you think  she puts up with  you?  I don't know,  dude.  I mean, why does  any chick put up  with any of us?  We're all a bunch  of fucking assholes.  I mean, think of 
[04:26:00]  you, think of him,  think of Norm.  I mean, we're all  fucking crazies.  I rule.  You what?  I rule.  Yeah.  Yeah, I rule, too.  I'm ruling video  games, you 40-year-old  loser.  All right, well,  this was, like,  not really part of  the radio show,  so don't, like,  judge us on this  segment, please.  Jesus Christ.  It was like a  Dr. Phil program  and just...  Yeah.  It was interesting.  It was.  It's the kinder, 
[04:26:30]  gentler side of the  O&A show.  Yeah.  All right.  Unmasked with  Bob Kelly.  Thank you, Bob,  for stopping by today.  All right.  Jimmy's awake.  I'm awake.  Just had your eyes  closed.  He's resting his eyes.  I don't blame you.  I saw him.  I saw him.  All right.  Is Roland doing  guest today or no?  I don't think so.  Not anymore.  All right.  Yeah.  Fuck it.  Pitch a guest,  fucking put on a 
[04:27:00]  pitcher's glove and  pitch it to me at  home.  Rob Barlett,  thank you.  Thank you, guys.  You don't have to  sit around.  Rob, thank you so  much.  It's my pleasure.  You kidding me?  You don't have to  sit around, though.  It was just us  shooting the shit.  This was called  shooting the shit.  I like shooting the  shit.  I'm going to pitch  this to X-Ab.  Shooting the shit.  Shooting the shit.  And then if somebody  could actually bring  guns in.  Shooting the shit.  And shoot.  But then he'd  throw up and then  it wouldn't be a  shoot shit. 
[04:27:30]  Would you throw up  if you actually  shot shit?  Holy shit.  By the way,  Rachel in  Illinois, this is  exactly what I'm  thinking.  Oh, my husband and  I had a reception  with appetizers only.  That is the fucking  way to go if you're  getting married.  A new group of  food came out every  hour.  Plenty of food,  no sit-down dinner.  That took two  fucking hours.  It was great.  Everybody loved it.  My brother got  married recently.  His cocktail hour,  whatever the fuck  you call it, it was  an extended cocktail  hour.  It was amazing.  It was every type of  food you could  possibly want.  And then it went 
[04:28:00]  off in my head.  I'm like, this is  what we need to do.  Fuck the sit-down  dinner after all this  great food.  It was everything from  clams and shrimp and  mussels marinara and  some sushi and  salads and cheeses.  It was like a buffet.  But it was everything  you could possibly want.  Then I'm thinking to  myself, why are we  going to sit down and  eat at this point?  That's wasting the  time.  That's what we were  going to do.  That's always the  turning point at a  wedding when you have  to sit down for the  fucking food.  You know how you  should get married?  Online for a free  pregnancy test. 
[04:28:30]  That's how you get  married?  That's how you should  do it.  Yeah, but you're going  to do a big wedding  though.  Huh?  You're going to have a  fancy wedding.  Like a whole fucking  giant pipe organ.  I don't know.  She's like low-key.  She doesn't like all  this attention.  I had flip-flops on  at my wedding.  That's cool.  I like that a lot.  That's what we're  trying to figure out.  It was the best.  By the way, that's 
[04:29:00]  round 10.  Someone's keeping  track.  Every time that bell  rings, someone's like  round 9.  Now we're up to  round 10.  All right, we're  babbling.  But it's shooting  the shit.  Another installment  of shooting the shit  on the road.  One of these days  we'll do this again.  Just sitting around  fucking around.  No pressure.  I like the no pressure.  I was telling Anthony.  I'll tell you one  other thing.  This is inside,  but fuck it.  And I went to  Boston for the  BCN Halloween  party, right?  And it was so good  to be on a stage  just fucking around 
[04:29:30]  and doing our thing.  And we did very well.  Everyone said we did  a great job up there.  Knowing that people  weren't watching us  so closely to  write about our  every move  on a fucking  website.  It was really  exhilarating  just to do it  and not worry  about it.  Because unfortunately  none of our listeners  could get into the  party.  So it was just us  doing our thing  knowing that it  wasn't going to be  written about anywhere.  And it was a good  feeling.  I know this is  inside and stuff,  but I'm speaking 
[04:30:00]  from the heart.  It was nice.  That's good.  I like this.  It's kind of like  with Jimmy,  probably like  with the small gigs  you're doing.  Exactly why.  You go up there  and you're like  no pressure, right?  You know that you're  trying out shit  and you're like  there's not eyes  just watching  your every move.  Yeah, I don't,  I mean.  I want you to come  and I want you to  like it,  but there's no pressure.  I have paper.  I sit on stage.  I would love to see  you under those  conditions.  So they know  that you're just  working this up.  Yeah, I mean,  I'm not big enough  to do Dane's gigs,  but I'm not doing 
[04:30:30]  100 seat theaters,  100 seat restaurants.  The audience  is what Jimmy says.  Actually,  I just want to speak  for Jimmy.  Fuck his audience.  That's what he says  all the time.  He's going  Janine Garofalo style.  Yeah, yeah.  All confused  at the pay.  Well, let me work  this out.  No, I got like  it's all new.  It's not the HBO stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah, but see when  here's the difference  when Janine Garofalo  does that.  It's her.  It's her act.  It's her honed act  that she's been doing  for 10 years.  Like, let me see  what I'm going to try next.  And it's something  she's been doing  for 10 fucking years.  Yeah, exactly.  That's the difference. 
[04:31:00]  All right, guys.  Enough.  Shooting the shit is over.  Over, I say.  How many rounds?  I think it comes in now.  I was working in the lab  late one night  when my eyes beheld  an eerie sight  for my monster  from his slab  began to rise  and suddenly 
[04:31:30]  to my surprise  he did the mash  he did the monster mash  the monster mash  it was a graveyard smash  he did the mash  it caught on  in a flash  he did the mash  he did the monster mash  from my laboratory  in the castle east  to the master bedroom  where the vampires feast  the ghouls all came  from humble abodes  to get a jolt  from my electrodes  they did the mash 
[04:32:00]  they did the monster mash  the monster mash  it was a graveyard smash  they did the mash  it caught on  in a flash  they did the mash  they did the monster mash  the zombies  were having fun  the party  had just begun  the guests included  wolfman  dracula  and his son  the scene was rocking  and all were digging  and all were digging the sounds  Igor on chains 
[04:32:30]  backed by the banging hounds  the coffin bangers  were about to arrive  with the vocal group  the crypt kicker 5  they did the monster mash  they played the monster mash  it was a graveyard smash  they played the monster mash  they caught on in a flash  they played the mash  then they played  the monster mash  this got a lot of lyrics  out from his coffin 
[04:33:00]  drac's voice did ring  seems he was troubled  by just one thing  he opened the lid  and shook his fist  and said  whatever happened  to my transylvania twist  it's now the mash  it's now the monster mash  the monster mash  and it's a graveyard smash  it's now </pre>
