<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast from Bill's Bar in Boston on Patriots Day (Marathon Monday) was a raucous, highly profane affair.  The show, originating from Bill's Bar, featured Opie and Anthony alongside a rotating cast of guests including Wheelchair Fred, Twitchels, Bam, Big A, Club Soda Kenny, Master Poe, Psycho Mark, and No Filter Paul, along with the band Buckcherry (Josh and Keith), and representatives from Barstool Sports.  The broadcast was punctuated by frequent and unrestrained use of offensive language, crude jokes, and insult comedy directed at the guests, the audience, and even the Boston Marathon itself.

The show opened with discussions about Boston vs. New York sports rivalries, fueled by audience chants of "Yankee Suck!", and the hosts' recent removal from DirecTV, which they discussed at length, comically attempting to read an official statement with the help of various guests.  Bam unveiled a "Bubba is a cunt" t-shirt, and discussed a video he made documenting a homeless woman ("Lady Di").  Big A's carrying of a camera bag (mistaken for a "man purse") provided further fodder for ribbing.  The hosts recounted their experience at a Dane Cook show, and discussed Jimmy Norton's involvement in "Meet the Creeps."  Wheelchair Fred was repeatedly goaded into various actions and comments, highlighting the show's often cruel and demeaning humor.  Twitchels' involuntary movements and participation in stunts added to the chaotic atmosphere.


A significant portion of the broadcast stemmed from the Jägermeister Music Tour at the Bank of America Pavilion earlier that day.  This segment detailed a contest involving the awarding of boomboxes to audience members who performed humiliating acts, culminating in an "underwear sniffing contest" centered around Wheelchair Fred.  Numerous audience members participated, demonstrating a willingness to engage in increasingly vulgar acts for prizes. No Filter Paul, an Englishman, created a hostile exchange with the audience while giving away t-shirts. Chris Daughtry and Taylor Hicks impersonators were brought on stage for comedic effect. Buckcherry discussed their new album, "15," the "Crazy Bitch" music video (and its availability on SuicideGirls.com), MTV censorship, and their use of MySpace to find women for the video. The segment also featured a woman who exposed her breasts and Johnny Tork, whose ambiguous gender and strong-smelling underwear created a highly uncomfortable and offensive scene, leading to extreme reactions from the hosts and crew.


Back at Bill's Bar, the show continued with discussions about a man’s unusually large and foul-smelling underwear, prompting further disgusted reactions. A bet was placed on how long Twitch, a person with Tourette's Syndrome, could remain silent, leading to audience participation.  A highly interrupted attempt at interviewing Barstool Sports women was marred by the hosts' crude commentary and audience heckling, including repeated chants of “Eat her box” and “Die from AIDS,” alongside plentiful shouting and obscenities. Microphone malfunctions added to the overall chaos.  Psycho Mark delivered a characteristically profane performance, fueled by alcohol. The broadcast ended with more chaotic interactions with the Barstool Sports representatives and the hosts’ usual vulgar closing remarks. The overall tone of the broadcast was one of unrestrained, often cruel and offensive, humor.

[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  We love when Hawk fucks up. 
[00:04:30]  Shut up.  But more importantly, we see Derek's balls.  You just relax. Here comes the funny.  Problem, Hawk?  My cross is burning so bad.  Shut up!  What's up, Boston?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Holy Jesus.  Bunch of animals.  Holy cow. 
[00:05:00]  They're drinking.  They're drinking already.  Holy shit.  What's up, Boston?  Oh, no.  Right away.  Wheelchair front in the front row.  Ah, wheelchair front.  I'm seeing so many old friends.  Jesus Christ.  All right.  Got a couple of girls.  You know, I've noticed we've got more girls as time goes on at these appearances.  That's a cheer before you get raped. 
[00:05:30]  That's wonderful, ladies.  It's beautiful.  Give a big woo-woo to let every animal know where you are.  It's like the gazelle going, here I am to the lion.  Wow.  I'm amazed.  Marathon Monday.  Everybody who really isn't very athletic are the ones that are here.  Everyone else would have maybe at least watched or something or gone to.  Anyone going to watch later or anyone give a shit or what?  No?  Hell no. 
[00:06:00]  It's all about the partying, hanging out.  And, OB, they're drinking beer.  They have these red lights that I swear are going to give people.  I want to see.  The first person to get an epileptic seizure from the red light will give a prize to or something.  These things are all over the face.  Big Kev comes up and just, like, shoves it in my face.  He goes, look at this.  And they're handing them out to everyone, right?  Yeah, you're going to get one of those Pokemon cartoon seizures.  Well, I guess we've got to tell the rest of America we're at Bill's Bar on Lansdowne Street, 
[00:06:30]  right behind the Green Monster here in Boston.  And there's a huge line outside.  And I guess they're wanting everybody.  Whatever the fuck.  Wanting.  Wanting.  Wanting.  Everyone.  So we've got, like, half the place filled so far.  The beer taps are flowing.  Wanting.  Wanting.  It's early, man.  We left the hotel and everyone was getting ready to run the stupid marathon in our hotel.  You see that?  Oh, that woman that came up.  We're just going to get some water or some shit.  And some woman comes up and, like, she's already, like, like this. 
[00:07:00]  It's a little visual.  But she's in front of the counter, like, I'll have some of the cookies.  She's jogging in place.  I got a cargo boost.  So get me some of that.  Shut up.  I hope you snap an ankle when he says go.  Yeah, it's great to be here in Boston for this.  But the marathon, I'm sorry.  I don't get it.  Fuck that shit. 
[00:07:30]  Thank you.  There you go.  Fuck that shit.  I was having so much trouble as a broadcaster finding the right words.  So thank you, sir.  What I meant was fuck that shit.  Wait.  Fuck that shit.  Fuck that shit.  Fuck that shit.  Fuck that shit.  Fuck that shit.  Oh, we like when they chant stuff.  Wait.  Who said fuck the marathon besides wheelchair Fred's inner voice?  Oh.  Oh, wow.  You're tough, Fred. 
[00:08:00]  Fred's giving us the finger, Anthony.  I don't know what to do about that.  It's just another rolling Monday for Fred.  Just another they-can-do-what-I-can-t Monday.  Oh, shit.  God damn it.  She died.  Wow.  I understood that perfectly.  That's right.  Oh, you're stupid.  I'm stoned.  Oh, you're stoned?  Oh, you're stupid.  Oh.  We're stupid?  You know, I'll take stupid from a guy that shoved a dildo up his ass anyway. 
[00:08:30]  You guys.  God, Fred's been here five minutes.  He hasn't asked us for money yet.  This could be a new record.  Surprise, surprise.  Yeah, wonderful.  Surprise, surprise.  That's what the doctor told him when he woke up.  Take this, sit in it, and stay there.  The good news is you won't be getting any mud on those new white sneaks. 
[00:09:00]  Ready to take lemons and make lemonade.  LOL.  Oh, wow.  Great to see you, Fred.  A lot of people from New York did the road trip.  Came from New York.  Yeah.  We got the regular.  Yankee suck!  Oh, there it goes.  Oh, let me see.  Yankee suck!  I'll join that chance.  Four minutes in.  Wow.  You guys are slacking.  It's just Boston Red Sox shit everywhere. 
[00:09:30]  Wherever you go.  I hopped in a cab, and it's just stickers all over the place.  You guys just got to constantly remind yourselves, yes, this is where they play.  Great.  Don't you know that they play here?  You don't need the stickers.  You don't need the Yankees.  The Yankees who won, I believe, last night, right?  Yeah, but the New York Mets have the best team in baseball.  There you go.  There you go.  That's good.  That's something you can say every year.  Well, thanks.  It's all about this year.  We'll see. 
[00:10:00]  I see a bunch of, I predict, a bunch of bright, shiny, new Mets caps on people.  They're going to be the bandwagon jumpers for the Mets.  I doubt it, because like we were saying last week, it's the worst logo to wear in baseball.  Yeah, and you brought up a great point that the brothers aren't wearing it.  If the brothers aren't wearing it, it's not a good fashion.  It ain't cool.  You know, Yankee caps everywhere.  Boston caps.  I'm sure a lot of the old-time Boston fans are a little pissed off when the guy shows up with a nice, brand-new, shiny one,  especially after they won the World Series. 
[00:10:30]  Ah, you took it.  But we haven't a couple pointed out over here.  Like, I see this guy over here.  This guy's got the chewed-up Boston cap, probably had it since he was like eight years old.  Let me see that.  And this guy's got the brand-new Yankee Boston hat.  Oh, look at that.  Well, it's from 04, actually.  Oh, no.  That's a cut.  Yeah.  Throwing his cock all over it.  Now your hat has A, stupid.  Yeah, change that B to a big A. 
[00:11:00]  And Ben was giving us some Ben facts, talking about the Boston Red Sox cap, the pink one.  Sure wasn't giving hair care styling tips.  Nice haircut, Prince Valiant.  What did I say his hair looked like on Saturday night from one of those New Guinea tribes?  Where they just style it with mud?  We need to Photoshop him. 
[00:11:30]  Is it the New Guinea tribe that has, like, bole-y in the back?  Where they put the bole-y in the back?  Yeah, it's like the bole haircut.  It's kind of, like, Mayan or Aztec guy.  Shouldn't you be cutting off a clit with that haircut?  It looks like a lunch lady who has the hairnet on.  Let me see the back.  Come on.  I'm sorry.  Ow, ow, ow.  I don't understand.  I don't understand.  I would get put a cap on, but they can't make one that fits. 
[00:12:00]  I don't know.  Ben is home, and he couldn't be happier, so.  What were you saying about the pink Boston Red Sox cap?  The number one female-selling hat, like, sporting gear in the world.  Yeah, where'd that come from, by the way?  Marketing director of the Red Sox.  Yeah.  All right.  You didn't see the pink fucking Yankee cap ever, like, years before.  Oh, yeah.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  We're ripping you off.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I see no Phil DePaul made the trip.  Of course he did.  He hung out in the studio Friday, and we didn't even put you on mic. 
[00:12:30]  Thank God.  And I think he was bummed about that.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, no Phil DePaul?  How you doing?  Glad to be in Boston.  Never been here before.  Well, uh...  Go fuck yourself.  Well, the one good thing about you being in Boston, you don't have to worry about looking  around before you make a black joke.  I don't know.  Yeah.  The racist fucking city.  You actually keep it to yourself if there are no blacks to hear it.  It's like, why waste this, good one? 
[00:13:00]  Huh?  That's it?  Wonderful.  That's all he's got.  Don't I notice about the Opie and Anthony fans is the New York Opie and Anthony fans,  and then there's the Boston Opie and Anthony fans, and they kind of have this thing.  They kind of hate each other in a weird way.  Yeah, of course they do.  Stop it.  Like, the Philly fans always got along with everybody.  Yeah.  They're a bunch of whores.  Not that they can't hear us.  White wheelchair friend.  I'm both.  You're both?  We know you're both.  I live in New York. 
[00:13:30]  I grew up in New York.  You grew up in New York.  I live...  No one cares.  No one cares.  No one cares.  No one cares.  I thought when he said, I am both, he was talking about his sexuality.  We already know that, Fred.  What do you mean Boston and New York?  You're a burden in both cities.  I grew up in New York.  I live in Boston.  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  I got something for that. 
[00:14:00]  Somewhere.  Oh, no.  Little crickets.  Thank you, Fred.  I know you look like shit.  What?  That's really accurate.  I know I look like shit.  Huh?  I...  I know I look like shit.  How does it feel that we replaced you with new crazy guys?  Tell them, Fred.  Like, where's...  Like, where's...  Like, Twitchell's is...  Like, Twitchell's is here.  Twitchell, come to the stage, Twitchell. 
[00:14:30]  He's the new star of the OPN Anthony show.  Jump!  Jump!  Jump!  Jump!  Jump!  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah.  Jump!  Jump!  Jump!  Jump!  How hard is it to walk through the crowd and jump at the same time?  You see that?  So much excitement.  There he is.  Jump!  Jump!  Jump!  Jump!  Jump!  Jump!  Jump!  Jump!  Jump!  Jump!  Jump!  Jump!  Ben, give him hot coffee.  Give him hot coffee.  He is so...  How was your short bus tour show? 
[00:15:00]  Oh, it was great.  I had a great experience with it, and a lot of people from New York showed up.  I appreciate...  I was...  For someone that switches around and moves as much as him, he's so out of shape.  It really is.  Like, wow.  You would really think he'd get a good ab workout.  Yeah, like...  Look at this.  There's your first photo op, everyone.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Jesus Christ.  Everybody start chanting, crunch, crunch. 
[00:15:30]  Crunch, crunch.  Push up.  Push up.  Yeah, too bad he doesn't have that twitch.  He'd have a six-pack stomach.  Is there a Tourette's where you just work out and don't stop?  You should get it.  God is cruel, man.  If you had the right twitch, you'd have a six-pack there, Twitchels.  And he's wearing the Phillies cap.  What do you guys think of the Phillies?  Who gives a fuck?  Exactly.  Fair enough.  Jesus Christ.  Wheelchair Fred gets more exercise than you.  I never met Wheelchair Fred.  I never met him.  Oh, there you go. 
[00:16:00]  There's old, new.  Oh, it'd be nice to meet you.  Isn't that wonderful?  We're bringing freaks together for years now.  We have another microphone.  I actually feel more...  Hold on, hold on, Twitchels.  We have another microphone for Wheelchair Fred so these guys could converse a little bit.  Chit-chat.  No?  A little chit-chat.  Yeah.  Hey, Ben, we got a guest headset over there.  Yeah, headset.  Give that to Ben.  Great.  Yeah.  Give it to Twitchels so he can fling it off his head when he twitches.  There you go. 
[00:16:30]  You are...  I hear...  I hear you're crazy, motherfucker.  I hear you're crazy, motherfucker.  Wheelchair Fred.  I think you're crazy.  Make him jump.  If you say jump, he'll jump.  Jump.  Jump harder.  That's so good.  Jump on your ass.  No, you just have to say jump.  It'll jump, Fred.  Yeah.  Jump on your ass. 
[00:17:00]  Tell Fred to walk.  Jump on your ass.  Tell Fred to walk.  Yeah.  Jump on my ass.  Really?  Hey.  Uh-huh.  Jump on my ass.  Come on, Fred.  Roll.  Roll.  Roll.  Roll.  I can do that.  Ooh.  Ooh.  We just told the wheelchair Fred story about him trying to walk and stay on stage.  Remember when I tried to heal you on stage?  Yeah, I like it. 
[00:17:30]  Drank it!  Drank it!  Drank it!  Drank it!  Drank it!  I think it's on you.  Yeah, it's on you.  Oh, my God.  Drank it!  Drank it!  Drank it!  Hold on.  You can't put it on his head.  All right, listen.  Listen.  We're losing control.  Why aren't you putting it on your head?  All right, Twitchels.  Don't be so overwhelmed.  It's all okay.  I can't hear anything.  All right.  Now we're set, okay?  Hey, speaking of Twitchels, we put the Twitchels videos up on Beat.com. 
[00:18:00]  Break.com.  Oh, Break.com.  Sorry, Break.com.  And the comments, man, we were getting killed.  What was that about, Steve?  Everyone thought that the videos were really, really cruel.  Yeah, a lot of, I don't know.  Some people get a conscience every once in a while, and some people thought it was really  mean, but they don't, but even though it was posted that he was a complete willing participant  in the whole process.  I read those comments that they wrote on Break.com, and after I read the comments...  Hold on, Twitchels.  You've got to put the...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, shit. 
[00:18:30]  This is working really well.  Wait, Steve, you mean they thought it was mean that we took a guy with an affliction and  had him slap pubic hair into his own face?  Yeah.  They're right.  We're garbage.  Oh, okay, then.  Then they were accurate.  The deal is, though, they saw the video, and they thought we were exploiting him, not knowing  that Twitchels has no problem doing it.  Right, Twitchels?  All right, why don't you...  It'll never, ever be where we can do something and people don't think we're being cruel.  I was just thinking the pest might want to go to Break.com and tell them a thing or two. 
[00:19:00]  The most important thing is we don't give a shit.  We never have.  That's right.  I mean, look, we made Wheelchair Fred lie in his own bathtub and stick a dildo in his  ass, and it was funny as hell.  That was nice.  Thank you.  That was nice.  Thank you.  Did he eat it?  Mine?  We got complaints from people, but he sure didn't mind.  Hey, Twitch, uh, uh, uh, Fred, how's your love life?  Lousy.  Lousy?  Looking for a chick?  I'm so lonely. 
[00:19:30]  It's ridiculous.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Oh, thank you.  Go back.  So he's still lonely there.  Uh, no surprise, right?  No.  Yeah, I was ugly.  You're going to be, uh...  You're going to be, uh, trying to find a chick here today? 
[00:20:00]  These are like your opportunities.  You're a star, so you should work the crowd, try to find something.  I see some pretty girls up front here and everything.  Yeah.  Uh, maybe you could work, uh, work the room.  They won't give me the right time of day.  Uh, what?  Who speaks Fred?  They won't give me the right time of day.  Oh, they won't give you the time of day.  Look, look, you got a girl.  Oh, Fred.  Fred, a beautiful blonde-haired girl sitting on your lap. 
[00:20:30]  Look at that, Fred.  She looks real thrilled to be on Fred's lap.  So thrilled.  I'm, I'm so excited and thrilled by Fred.  Oh, really?  If you're excited by Fred, why don't you, why don't you make out with him?  It's one thing to sit on his lap.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Let's see how excited you really are.  I live in my room.  Why don't you smell his underwear?  Oh, man.  Oh.  All right. 
[00:21:00]  Why don't you see what kind of cranky ass he has?  A little bit.  He smells a little bit?  A little cranky ass?  Sitting in that chair for hours and hours on end?  Yeah, we understand, Fred.  How was that, though?  You got a little thrill there?  Pretty girl sits on your lap?  Yeah, very, pretty girl.  Hubba, hubba, hubba.  Hubba, hubba, hubba.  That's great.  That's wonderful.  That's usually reserved for people in wheelchairs from polio. 
[00:21:30]  Hubba, hubba.  That's right, Fred.  But now I'm drooling.  23 skidoo.  What is he?  He's now drooling?  Now he's drooling.  That's just a normal day.  You may be crippled, but you have a good rap.  Oh, baby, lay my fire.  Oh, shit.  Well, at least he's in the 60s.  He's working his way up decade by decade.  Also, we want to say hi to Bam.  Where's Bam?  Oh, in the back. 
[00:22:00]  I was walking over here to Bill's Bar in Boston, and I saw Bubba is a Cunt t-shirt.  Yeah, those are wonderful.  And how many did you guys print up?  I don't know.  I didn't print them.  You didn't print them?  The diaper did.  Who did?  Why don't you come up here?  There's one.  Could you move closer to the front?  Shut up.  Or move closer to a microphone or something?  Oh, there he is.  Oh, there's Bam.  I was in the back.  There's like hundreds of people here.  It's hard to get to know.  Okay, why don't you stand up so everyone can get a photo up here? 
[00:22:30]  That's right.  This is the latest creation by the pest, I guess.  Bubba is a cunt.  Bubba is a cunt.  The hit single from my brother Elmo is now on a t-shirt.  Wow.  You know, I hope this show today isn't mistaken for a workout show.  Yeah.  Wow.  There you go.  There you go.  There's a naked belly.  There.  He ain't got nothing on me.  That is fucking Elvis, eight minutes before he died. 
[00:23:00]  Fat Jew!  Fat Jew!  Fat Jew!  Fat Jew!  Either they're all sneezing or they're calling you a fat Jew.  And also, I'm hearing rumors that you did a homeless cribs or something?  Yeah.  With Lady Di?  What's that about?  We tracked down Lady Di.  Now, how did you do that?  She's staying probably around two miles away from where I live.  So, I know the area pretty well.  You knew that it was a Pathmark?  Pathmark.  And a train platform. 
[00:23:30]  Abandoned?  Abandoned.  Abandoned railroad platform.  Yes.  And that's where all the homeless live in the area.  So, you went down there with a video camera?  Yeah.  Myself and Sergeant Magoo, we went down there Saturday night.  Sergeant Magoo.  Jesus Christ.  We went down there and we filmed Cribs with her.  We have her making out with another homeless person.  We have her...  Was she drunk?  Oh, wasted.  Yeah, wasted.  Wasted chugging beers.  All right, hold on.  Cribs speak straight.  Walk us through this.  So, you went to the Pathmark?  Where did you find her? 
[00:24:00]  Well, we went up top in the train tracks to start looking for her.  Did you see her ex-husband?  I must see her ex-husband.  Of course, he killed himself in front of a choo-choo.  So...  Ah, funny motherfuckers.  She wasn't there and we were just starting to interview all the other homeless people about  her and they're starting to tell us how she's sleeping around with all the people there.  Did you get into graphic details?  Graphic details about...  Like what?  What is she doing?  Ponytails and face waking up in the morning, not drunk, not knowing that she slept with 
[00:24:30]  the guy the night before because she passed out drunk.  Um, about her, which guy she's sleeping around with.  You know what, AIDS...  AIDS will make her lose a few pounds, which might actually be good for her.  Did you ever see the movie Throw Mama from a train?  I did, I did.  That's exactly what she looks like.  She's looking more like that.  I wonder where you got that, uh, that from.  You've been saying that for years, right? 
[00:25:00]  Ooh-hoo.  So, uh...  You finally got a hold of her?  We finally got a hold of her as we were leaving.  Hey, look, it's stuck at us.  Doug calling.  That was Doug.  That was Doug.  Yeah, Doug calling you.  Fucking guy.  What a smartass.  All right, so you found her as you guys were leaving.  We found her as she was leaving and we got her, uh, to give us a little tour of where  she's living, the bed she's sleeping on.  We got her to admit that she's...  Is it just a mattress?  It's a mattress on the ground and she broke it while sleeping with another guy on there. 
[00:25:30]  While having sex, the mattress caved in.  Hobo come!  Oh, hobo come.  Hobo come.  That's right.  That'll be the next t-shirt.  Hobo come.  Well, that is fantastic.  We have video of her panhandling, making out, a couple of other things.  She thought we were actually there to help her out.  That's great.  Now, you're going to be editing this and then putting it up where?  Yeah, we're going to put it up on SoulBlownAids.com.  Very nice. 
[00:26:00]  And, uh, yeah, we're going to...  We'll link it everywhere.  We'll give everyone copies of this, so Steve will have a copy.  I can't wait to see it.  You know how many guys are fucking her and waking up and running right to AA meetings?  That's their bottom three.  Really?  It's motivation?  What gender is it?  Well, that's great.  And the t-shirts are wonderful.  Yeah, thanks.  Sniper pros.  I'm sure walking around the streets that won't offend many people. 
[00:26:30]  Aware proudly.  That's good.  Thank you very much.  Very good.  Have a great...  Have a good one.  Have a what?  Have a great one.  He's a little nervous.  He forgot what is happening.  The first car crash of the day.  Hey, I saw you take out the cell phone.  Could you just hold your hand straight out?  It's not as bad.  Yeah, it's not as bad as the police.  He's calming down a little bit.  You're shaking a little bit.  Yeah, absolutely.  It's a lack of alcohol in the morning.  Yeah.  Well, get a drink.  Start drinking, God damn it.  That's what I was doing.  All right.  How many on their first beer? 
[00:27:00]  All right.  Wow, look at these alcoholics.  How many on their second?  All right.  How many on their third?  Third beer.  And how many over three so far?  All right, man.  Hey, Pam, Pam.  All right.  Why don't we take our first break?  Because they're trying to get more people into Bill's Bar here in Boston.  Yeah, bring them in.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show live from Boston.  Let's hear it, guys.  We want to get back to talk about Anthony and his gambling. 
[00:27:30]  We went to the Dane Cook Show.  And we got to talk about DirecTV.  Something awful happened as far as the show goes.  And we'll get into that next as well.  Stay there.  Wah, wah, wah.  Live from Boston.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's showtime, folks.  Turn it on and watch a show.  You're going to be made fun of.  All right.  Man, those guys are really cards.  Why don't you shove it out your ass?  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:28:00]  Ah, you're checking out the Opie virus spreading across America.  We're in Boston this morning.  Let's hear it, Boston.  We got a crowd.  We're at Bill's Bar on Lansdowne Street, right behind the Green Monster.  The Red Sox are playing at 11 a.m. today.  The only time all year long, they play at 11 o'clock, right? 
[00:28:30]  It's a crazy time for Boston.  The whole city is not working today.  You got the marathon.  You got the Red Sox starting at 11.  And you got the Opie and Anthony Show live as well.  That's not a bad thing at all.  I'll be locked in my hotel room.  Thank you.  Why?  Because I don't like dealing with this city when it comes to the marathon or Red Sox games.  It's just a pain in the ass.  You can't get around.  You're a party pooper.  No, I'm not.  You're a party pooper.  I've never pooped one party. 
[00:29:00]  I swear to you.  Are you going home tonight?  I was going to, but apparently you can't get out of this city on marathon.  It's going to be impossible.  Yeah, it's impossible.  Hey, we just went to the bathroom.  No show tomorrow.  Oh, there's no show tomorrow.  You're absolutely right, sir.  Are you kidding me?  I knew it.  This is how we do things here at XM.  We're faggots.  We're in a hotel room for three days to do a three-hour broadcast, and we take a day off afterwards because we work so hard. 
[00:29:30]  We're exhausted.  Don't tell the bosses.  So there's a huge line outside, too.  They're going to open up next door, I guess?  Yeah, just because people keep coming.  Huh?  Yeah, we're going to throw the overflow into the bar next door, and supposedly there's going to be some kind of video feed.  And so they could check out this crap.  Jesus.  Fucking bunch of zilches under red lights.  Fascinating to watch.  Also, we got the Pal Talk cameras here, right, Anthony?  Yes, we do.  I just, we got three up and running. 
[00:30:00]  One right over here.  Of course, you want to put the girls on it.  Makes it look like girls are here.  And then there's a couple of stage cams.  So people that couldn't make it here can check it out for the comfort of their own home.  Are the girls allowed to let one slip out for the Pal Talk cameras, or...  If they so wanted to, the camera's right there.  It's pointing right at them.  I mean, I don't see why they couldn't.  All right, it'll be up to them.  They might let something slip out a little later.  Maybe a couple of beers. 
[00:30:30]  There's a few, I see they got some Jägermeister little tags on and leis.  What are those?  Little leis, little orange leis they're giving out.  With Jäger logos on them.  Nothing better than a chick after too many Jägers.  That's great.  Just sticking her ass while she's puking off the bed.  I don't know.  Also, Master Poe has made it to Bill's Bar.  Oh, yeah.  Master Poe. 
[00:31:00]  No, your mic's not.  All right, here we go.  Here's Master Poe.  He came 250 miles just to say...  Hey, guys, we're going to have a good time today.  Wait, you got to...  What happened, a tire blowout?  What was that?  Come on, Nick.  Ah-ha.  Ah-ha. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  All right.  He doesn't need a microphone, I guess.  He doesn't need a mic, and he could kill you with that microphone.  Did you bring some of your students?  Yes, I did.  Yeah?  Where are they?  Hey, Matt, where are you?  I got to tell you, this...  Master Poe came here on his own dime.  Yeah.  And where are you staying, like 45 minutes away from here?  Hilton Hotel.  In Randolph?  By the airport.  Oh, by the airport. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, wow.  Which one?  Dulles?  All right, by the airport.  Well, that's not too hard of a ride.  It's going to be real easy to get back to it, too, after the show.  I hope you brought a tent.  I hope you brought a helicopter.  You're not sleeping in your bed tonight.  No way.  All right.  Master Poe, everyone.  All right, guys.  O&A Party Roll!  Why not?  Why not?  Why not?  Get a new line! 
[00:32:30]  Get a new line.  Get a new line.  Also, we have Ziggy here from MyRadioStore.com.  Yeah, I got one of his cameras up also.  What, he's got a PalTalk camera set up?  Yeah, he's running sound for us today on PalTalk, and he's got a camera up.  There's a roving camera.  There's a lot of people at home.  I know a lot of people bitch when we talk about PalTalk.  Go fuck yourself.  Yeah.  But at home, it lets people participate up.  They can see everything that's going on.  And now we have, like, a four-camera shoot today.  Yeah, Ziggy, what's up, buddy? 
[00:33:00]  I'm the manager's hanging out, enjoying the fucking Boston shit.  Are you?  You guys have a lovely city here, by the way.  It took us a whole three hours to visit the entire city walking.  Ziggy.  You're not a big fan of Boston, Ziggy?  No, it's nice, but, you know, three hours walk, you see the whole thing.  You did the little walking tour.  Yeah, we saw the big ship in the fucking water.  The big ship.  You see Paul Revere, the church.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wonderful.  Freedom Trail.  The Freedom Trail.  Did you do the Freedom Trail?  Freedom Trail. 
[00:33:30]  Fuck the Freedom Trail.  Did you go to Faneuil Hall?  Follow the Red Brick Road, all that good shit.  Did you have a drink down at one of the bars in Faneuil Hall?  A few too many drinks, thank you.  A few too many, that's always fun.  I'm actually not drinking this morning.  No.  Hey, what's wrong with you?  You got a fever or something?  That's a new thing.  That's a new thing?  And you're selling all your fine XM products, right?  Yes, go get your Opie and Anthony shirts at myradialstore.com.  There you go.  Myradialstore.com and all your XM needs, right?  One last thing.  I'm just really, really happy.  Today's a great day for me. 
[00:34:00]  Liquid Metal is back on XM.  Oh, good.  Happy times.  Yeah.  I guess only for me, though.  And it's also replaced us on DirecTV, so there you go.  That I had nothing to do with.  Sorry.  Yeah, a lot of rumors over the weekend.  We have been taking off DirecTV, Anthony.  Yes, we were very happy to be on DirecTV.  People at home, if they didn't have XM and had DirecTV, we were right next to, we were  one channel down from Channel 2.  So, like, if you're watching Channel 2 and you screwed up, all of a sudden there we would 
[00:34:30]  be.  And people seem to enjoy it.  We got a lot of calls from a lot of people that listen to on DirecTV.  And I see you have an official statement in front of you.  I have the...  This is an official statement?  It's Steve's chicken scratch on the back of a ripped piece of paper.  I'm very suspicious because it's communique from Washington.  I'm not completely buying that Washington had nothing to do with this, by the way.  This is a direct quote from ELO about DirecTV. 
[00:35:00]  This is what I think of ELO's statement.  Have Wheelchair Fred read it to everybody.  All right.  Wheelchair Fred, if you would read this official statement from Eric Logan.  An official communique from Washington and why we're off DirecTV.  Here's Wheelchair Fred to explain to the faithful listeners of the Opie and Anthony program.  Go ahead, Fred.  Go ahead.  I can't read this chicken shit.  I can't read this chicken shit. 
[00:35:30]  You guys, this guy is like...  All right.  Oh, my God.  No, no, no, no, no, Fred.  You got to read it.  Ladies and gentlemen, Wheelchair Fred can't read.  An after-school special.  That's right.  You got to read it.  You got to read it.  According to ELO, company is gay. 
[00:36:00]  Company is gay.  I don't think ELO wrote that.  Company is going AA.  Yeah.  Company is going AA.  You go to a music comedy direction.  Uh-huh.  I love you, bro, grab you.  Uh-huh.  Wow.  Come on, Fred.  This is the official statement. 
[00:36:30]  It sucks.  Fred.  Yeah.  Hoo-hoo.  Tell him, Fred.  Oh, God.  Fred, shout up your ass.  Fred, shout up your ass.  That's good.  Good job.  Well, now he's wiping his ass with the official statement, Anthony.  Wait, well, now I'm not going to read it.  All right, enough.  Bring the official statement back up here.  I'm not reading it.  I'm not touching it.  I'm not doing it. 
[00:37:00]  Get the fuck away from me.  Is Big A here?  Yeah.  Where's Big A?  Big A will be.  Big A, get up here.  Another person that made the road trip from New York to be here in Boston.  He's making his way to the stage for the first time in Boston.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Big A.  Big A.  And make sure before he says it, he says, this is Elo's official statement. 
[00:37:30]  That's right.  All right, here comes Big A, everyone.  He made it to the stage.  That's right.  Another awful haircut and another awful body.  Another awful body.  He's got a purse!  He's got a purse!  He's got a purse!  He's got a what?  He's got a purse!  Purse?  Turn around!  He's got a man purse! 
[00:38:00]  He's got a man purse!  Turn around and show your man purse!  He's got a man purse!  The crowd has noticed that Big A has a man purse.  Oh, you faggot!  That's worse than a fanny pack.  He's got a man purse!  He's got a...  That's a purse!  Let me see.  Turn around.  What do you carry in there?  Mints and a rape whistle?  Turn around.  Let me see that.  It's a purse!  Let me see that thing.  That is a purse, you faggot. 
[00:38:30]  That's a purse.  That's...  That's my camera.  It's a what?  Big A.  It's a what?  Big A.  It's my camera.  Big A.  Big A.  Like the cock!  Big A.  Like the cock!  Big A.  Like the cock!  Apparently, Big A.  Like the cock.  Big A.  Big A.  Big A.  Big A.  Big A.  Big A.  He keeps his birth control in there.  Zero.  A man purse.  That's a man purse!  Talk into the microphone.  Talk into the microphone. 
[00:39:00]  You have to defend yourself.  Yeah.  I'm telling you, it's my camera.  I don't know if it's anywhere.  Oh, that's fair enough.  Camera.  It's just big enough for a baby leg.  So, is 1951 hairdo going to read the statement?  Sell.  Sell.  Sell.  Sell.  Sell.  All right.  Read the official communique from Washington.  You've got to say it's Eric's official statement.  Yeah.  Say, this is Eric Logan's official statement about DirecTV.  You're going to read it! 
[00:39:30]  The company is...  No, you have to say this is Eric Logan's official statement.  We're going to read it.  On DirecTV recording...  No, you idiot.  You idiot.  Repeat after me.  Come on, man.  This is Eric Logan's statement about DirecTV.  Come on, you shit dick.  Statement!  This is Eric Logan's...  Statement!  Yeah!  Statement!  Statement!  Statement!  About the stoppage of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:40:00]  Right.  All right, let's go.  Yeah, about the stoppage of Opie and Anthony.  Uh-uh.  Fuck this.  Punch!  Statement!  Stop it!  Stop it!  Toppage of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:40:30]  That's right.  On one of DirecTV's stations.  One of DirecTV's...  Stations!  Stations.  Due to the fact they've changed their standards.  Stations!  Stations!  Stations!  Hell yeah, Jimmy!  Hell yeah! 
[00:41:00]  Who put the big A in A?  Due to the...  Due to the fact...  Um...  Um...  Um...  Um...  This...  Of this...  That is painful.  For the new listeners, you can't say ST words.  That's why I haven't figured it out yet. 
[00:41:30]  All right.  Hey, Paul, fuck you.  Hey, Paul!  You're gonna take that!  All right, you got balls, big A.  You got balls.  Go fuck yourself, you stuttering cunt.  Ooh, all right.  Hey, he cheated.  He cheated.  What do you mean, he cheated?  He told me he cheated.  The last assault in the media contest, he fucking cheated.  He told me.  He called.  He was the motherfucker that called the fucking TV station.  You motherfucker. 
[00:42:00]  By the way, that's Sonny Pharrell.  I want to fucking run with the fucking Santa Claus, too.  If he didn't fucking call the fucking TV station.  Some motherfucking blimey British cock-sucking asshole.  Wow.  Paul, what do you have to say about that?  Fuck Boston and fuck Sonny.  Oh!  That is a smack talk going down.  Fuck you, Paul!  Fuck you, Paul!  Fuck you, Paul!  Fuck you, Paul!  Fuck you, Paul!  The act for Paul is amazing. 
[00:42:30]  We're still the reigning champions in New York, though, right?  Fuck you, Paul!  Fuck you, Paul!  Fuck you, Paul!  That's right.  Hey, Paul, where's your wife?  Is she here?  Oh, she's doing the Easter shit, son.  What?  Doing the Easter shit.  Sonny said,  some guy's using his cock to hunt for her eggs.  Jimmy Norton, everyone. 
[00:43:00]  Jimmy!  Jimmy!  All right, listen.  They're just babbling now.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right, back to Big A.  Big A.  It's very serious business.  We got kicked off DirecTV,  and we want to get to the bottom of this, by the way.  And I don't think the pests are going to take this one lightly,  but here's the official statement from Washington.  That's right, buddy!  Jimmy Norton, stay 12th!  The Orpheum!  Good points, man.  Awesome.  The alcohol's kicking in.  Why would anybody yell,  Jim Norton, May 12th, The Orpheum? 
[00:43:30]  Who cares if I'm the Orpheum?  It doesn't matter.  Me and Dave Attell.  It's not important.  Don't even think about it.  There's bigger business.  Go right ahead.  All right.  Go ahead, Big A.  Big A, read the statement, please.  Go ahead, Tweety.  Come on, Big A.  Come on, Big A.  Come on, Big A.  DirecTV, according to ELO.  The company is going in a music-only direction.  All non-music programming was removed from the platform. 
[00:44:00]  The decision to take off 12th content was not based on content or performance.  Major League Baseball Channel was also removed.  Any comments or questions need to be directed to DirecTV, not XM?  You're the reason, honey!  Oh, XM doesn't want to take any response to this at all?  No, no.  XM is saying it was DirecTV's choice, decision. 
[00:44:30]  They did it.  They said, I think what I heard from the big idiot up on the stage here is that DirecTV  decided they were taking all talk programming off, including, like, baseball, anything that  was a talk show, and just going with music.  So they took us off and replaced us with liquid metal.  Well, do we have a customer service number for DirecTV that we can give out?  Because some of the listeners may know what's going on and know somebody at DirecTV they 
[00:45:00]  could call.  We would want serious calls only, of course, at DirecTV.  Right.  Yeah, serious calls only.  I don't care what your name is.  It could be Bob, it could be Frank, it could be Ramone.  That's right.  I think any calls to DirecTV to let them know your dissatisfaction with this decision would  be greatly appreciated.  We have a customer service number we can give out because I think it's only fair in the  spirit of, but we would want serious calls.  I don't think they thought we were pulling our weight on DirecTV, so I think we have to 
[00:45:30]  Oh, is that it?  We have to give them a showing here.  Oh, thank you, Kenny.  1-800-DIREC-TV.  Club Soda Kenny, everyone.  Thank you.  We haven't heard from Club Soda Kenny yet.  Let's have Club Soda Kenny direct me.  This is Kenny's first appearance.  Skip!  Skip!  Skip!  Skip!  Skip!  Skip!  Skip!  Skip!  Skip!  Skip!  Skip!  Skip!  Skip!  Skip!  Skip!  They want him to skip, Anthony.  Skip!  Skip!  Skip!  Really?  Are you done chanting?  Listen, I want to thank everyone for coming. 
[00:46:00]  Get into the light, Kenny.  Get where people can speak.  Hey, Kenny, you're in the dark.  Stay where they can see you.  Yeah, where people can see you.  Yeah.  See how nicely dressed you are.  All right.  Come on, Joe Kenny!  Let's get together for the new chant.  Ready?  Look at that, Kyle!  O-N-A!  You know what I say.  O-N-A!  All the way!  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  Worst chant ever.  It is.  It's all long. 
[00:46:30]  It's kind of a question, and it's, you know what I say.  All right.  Well, I'll be fine.  Next round.  You've got to think about it for a little while.  You've got to hit it quick, Ken.  All right.  Club soda, Kenny, everyone.  That chant just wrecked the room.  No kidding.  It took the energy right out of this damn place.  We know some people on the papers.  He was a dirty cop.  He told pedophilia jokes.  He told pedophile jokes.  We got a lot of, they would like that story.  Think about his dog, his family.  They'll like a story like that.  We got people on the payroll. 
[00:47:00]  So what are we doing with DirecTV?  We're going to have a pest attack there?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck yeah, man.  And the number is 1-800-DIREC-TV.  There you go.  879 is no longer on DirecTV.  But they have to know, because they won't understand.  I would say, make sure you mention the Opie and Anthony show before you Ramone them,  because they won't get it at first.  Oh, they won't?  Really?  Well, no.  May I help you? 
[00:47:30]  Who Ramone?  Just going to show them how many people are listening to this radio program.  All right.  Anthony just got into town last night.  You stopped off at what?  Foxwoods?  I stopped off at the lovely casino resort of Foxwoods.  Got to thank some of the people down there.  I'll thank them by name, you know, when we get back to the studio.  But fantastic.  Loved it.  Went there.  You know I like to gamble a little bit. 
[00:48:00]  That's a lot of fun.  No.  No.  A little bit.  Rolled in there, and by, I guess, three hours in, I was down about two Gs.  About two large, playing three-card poker.  Which, if you've never played, it's three cards against the dealer's three cards.  You've got to get the best hand.  The dealer needs a queen.  If the dealer doesn't have a queen or better, you pretty much win. 
[00:48:30]  It's a game where you just kind of watch.  You kind of sit there, get your cards, and go, I'm fucked, or I think I'm going to win.  But what if you don't like your cards?  Can you say, no, no, no, I don't want that one, and he'll get you another one?  No.  You just sit there and watch.  You're stuck with your shitty cards.  But then if you get shitty cards, you can fold them, and you don't have to back up your bed.  You know, go down, play, lose some money, you'll have a pisser.  So I was down for a little, which I guess was making the casino very happy. 
[00:49:00]  And then I put $100 down in what is called the pair plus circle.  Now this thing, if you get a good hand, it pays certain odds.  It doesn't matter what the dealer has.  You get a pair, it pays even odds.  You get a straight, it pays like six to one, things like that.  And I wound up hitting a straight flush, which pays 40 to one.  I took those engines for four large. 
[00:49:30]  Four Gs.  Nice.  Right.  Which proves the adage, the rich get richer.  Why am I laughing?  It was a disgrace.  So again.  So how much were you up when you left?  I was up $3,000.  Look at that.  And I had to go.  I had to stay there and normally done what I usually do, which is lose everything I want  and go further into debt. 
[00:50:00]  But I had to go.  Kenny was calling me.  Anthony, you have to get to the hotel.  He actually called me.  I'm at the table.  It was a good luck charm, right?  Yeah, he said.  He goes, this is your good luck call, which seemed to work, but it also almost got me thrown  out of the casino.  They love when you're talking on cell phones at card tables, like camera phones or anything  that they think might give you any advantage whatsoever.  I'm at the table behind you. 
[00:50:30]  I could see what the dealer has.  You know, they really don't like any radio communication going back and forth.  So I pretty much hung up on the stupid guy.  No, I'm hanging up.  But your good luck call works.  And for that, I think I might buy you a bottle of water or something later.  I know how to give.  Can you imagine Kenny counting cards, Anthony?  A card counter for you?  Please don't make a fuss over me.  Kenny doesn't like when people make a fuss over him.  You deserve to win. 
[00:51:00]  Thank you, Kenny.  By the way, I spent a couple hours with Kenny, a few other people in the room last night  watching the latest version of Meet the Creeps.  Oh, yeah?  Jim Florentine's project featuring our own little Jimmy Norton.  Oh, Jimmy's involved.  And Club Soda Kenny.  These two are the stars of the latest Meet the Creeps video.  What was the premise of this one?  Well, Kenny plays a terrific gay guy.  Oh, you play a homosexual?  I play a great faggot.  Let me tell you. 
[00:51:30]  He plays a faggot in the latest version of Meet the Creeps.  Do you want to give the crowd a few of your gay lines there, Kenny?  I talk about taking yoga so I can almost suck my own cock now.  I misplaced my gerbil and I slipped on a condom and hopefully the next thing that was going to come out would be the gerbil.  But the highlight is little Jimmy Norton shirtless.  So go to meetthecreeps.com and buy the DVD. 
[00:52:00]  Anthony, I've got to tell you.  Yeah, Jimmy does three or four skits.  They're not skits, really.  Whatever.  Yeah.  And he's topless walking into these stores in Manhattan.  Everyone is completely horrified.  Why?  Why?  Yeah.  Are you being a gay guy?  No.  No, I'm just kind of like his friend who kind of yells at him in the store.  It's actually pretty funny.  He walks into the store, these stores, you know, no shirt on, and he yells at Kenny. 
[00:52:30]  Like Kenny's like a retarded type of person, a slow person.  Remember last time I was smacking Jimmy around?  Yes.  Well, the tables are turned this time, my friend.  Ah, okay.  Now this time I play the big retard and he yells at me.  That's a stretch.  Well, I like the one with the Chinese restaurant free buffet.  Yes, yes.  That's on the motherlode, ComedyCentral.com.  Right.  But this is like the X-rated Meek the Creep from the DVD now. 
[00:53:00]  Not the sanitized ones.  I can't wait to see it.  And you are retired now, right?  No problems.  Yes, I am retired now.  Thank everybody for their support.  It was overwhelming.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  And enough about me.  Let's get back to the stars of the day.  Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy.  And roll Jimmy Norton.  All right.  Thank you, Kenny. 
[00:53:30]  We spent Saturday night at the Dane Cook show.  Now.  Oh, don't they love Dane.  Yes.  I got to tell you.  They love Dane.  Besides, like, the three girls in the front row here.  Yeah.  The Dane Cook crowd is a little different than the Opie and Anthony crowd.  Now.  A little different.  What do you mean by that, Opie?  Whenever there's a rape, these are the people doing it, and the people at his show are the  ones receiving it.  They're a younger crowd, kind of like a more female-oriented fucking... 
[00:54:00]  Let's put it this way.  Really.  We should do less shit jokes.  You think it, yeah?  And we'd have that kind of crowd?  And we would have more women showing up at our events.  It was an arena full of fucking hot chicks and occasionally some boyfriends.  It was fucking...  As a comedian to watch, it was really depressing to see another comedian in front of 17 or 19,000  people.  19,000.  Doing that well.  But it was good, man.  It really was good.  It was very enjoyable.  Anthony, ready for this?  Yeah.  19,000 people.  Show ends.  They turn the room so he could do it again. 
[00:54:30]  Jesus Christ.  In one night.  Yeah.  He got 38,000 people.  To fucking...  What's it called?  That garden where the Celtics play?  The garden!  Oh, the garden.  I forgot.  Yeah.  The garden!  The garden!  There's two sold-out shows there for a Santa comic.  How was it, though, to hear?  Can you hear...  I don't know.  I was too busy crying.  Normally, comics, you know, it's more of an intimate atmosphere.  He's actually...  It kind of works better that way, I think.  You can work the crowd a little bit.  I wasn't... 
[00:55:00]  One thing he...  Hey, guy in section 306, up in the ropey, you're a fat.  Nice shirt.  Shirt.  Shirt.  No, it actually, he worked the room really well.  It was a big theater.  It was like a stage in the round.  It was just...  It was...  He worked it well, man.  And actually, any comic can do that amount of people and make it look comfortable.  It's him.  And he really did.  It was...  An honest assessment, Jimmy.  Material.  Funny.  Yeah.  I mean, it was stuff I haven't seen before.  Yeah.  They were all great.  We went backstage after.  Everybody was really...  Oh, you did? 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Glenn Close was back there.  Yeah, I saw Glenn Close.  I fucked her.  That's right.  You won't do...  I know.  I thought that would get like a big laugh.  I kind of paused.  I fucked her.  All right.  But I keep moving.  Did you touch her arm and go...  Glenn?  I don't believe that.  For a little picture?  I won't be ignored, Dan.  Yes, you will since that film.  And it was Bob Kelly's job to get the celebrity photo, thank God.  Oh, Bob Kelly had the pressure of getting a photo with Jimmy and Glenn Close.  I was off duty.  Yeah.  It was Kelly's job. 
[00:56:00]  And an old fathead Bob do.  He did good.  He looks like Sonny Farrelli.  Yeah, they look very similar.  But the Dane Cook show was amazing.  It was good, man.  It was really good.  And I'm sure he got the fucking HBO cameras in there.  It was really...  He held the crowd and everything.  That's tough to do.  Did Ben go with you guys?  No.  Ben, no.  I got a call from Ben from Fenway.  And it would have been easier to hear someone in battle in Fallujah than it was to hear Ben  trying to call from Fenway. 
[00:56:30]  What were you trying to tell me?  It was just...  You would call me to ask if we were off on Tuesday, but I missed the call because I was  watching the Red Sox.  You're twitching more than twitches, man.  Oh, he's crazy.  Jesus.  Yeah, so he's calling me from Fenway.  I don't know.  Where were you?  In the park.  Watching the game.  It was already going on.  Yeah.  I couldn't hear a goddamn word you were saying.  Watching the Sox.  No, I'm not watching the Sox.  I'm not watching the Sox.  I'm not watching the Sox.  Going to the game again today.  The Sox. 
[00:57:00]  Oh.  Enough about the Sox.  Exactly.  You've got to love the Yankee Sox chant five minutes into the broadcast.  Yeah, you've got to.  Way to galvanize them.  And everyone else here loved it, too, Ben.  You've got nothing on that, and you should have got a big one for that one.  All right, we're going to take a break, get the energy back in the room.  We're live from Bill's Bar in Boston with the O.P. and Anthony Pest, and we'll continue  in just a bit.  Stay there.  I am from Buffalo. 
[00:57:30]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Oh my, how ruthlessly absurd.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  We are live in Boston at Bill's Bar. 
[00:58:00]  Land down three.  Patriots Day.  Marathon Monday.  Nice.  We've got Jägermeister shots for everybody.  I think they're getting a little more into it.  They're passing out the Jägermeister shots.  Yeah, I'll do a little shot with everybody.  Who's got a shot in their head?  Anthony, you said Jägermeister shot.  Yeah.  A little bit.  Hey. 
[00:58:30]  Those motherfuckers.  And there you go.  Oh, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.  Anthony, why don't you take your survey with the beer thing?  Jägermeister's good stuff.  Just to see what's going on here, okay?  See how it's progressing.  All right.  Who's on their first beer?  Wow, now that got a pretty good cheer when we first got in.  Who's on their second?  Who's on their third? 
[00:59:00]  Who's had four?  Four seems to be good.  Anyone?  Five.  All right, a lot of five.  Six are over.  In the back again.  Those are the ones that are just hanging out at the bar.  Yeah, they're hanging at the bar, just slamming.  They don't give a shit about the broadcast.  They just want beer.  I just came here to drink, motherfucker.  All right, a few things really fast.  First of all, where's Don Wicklin? 
[00:59:30]  Don, grab a microphone.  Don Wicklin.  I want to find out what we got to give away here today, Anthony.  Don, why don't you tell everyone what we got to give away today.  Don Wicklin, everyone.  Here we go.  Jägermeister Skateboard signed by the boys.  Jägermeister Skateboard, very good.  Sky-Fi 2s with boom boxes.  Sky-Fi 2s with boom boxes, nice. 
[01:00:00]  Wait, wait, what about the boom boxes?  The boom boxes, okay.  We got two prizes so far.  Got a couple of those.  And we also got a pair of tickets for the Boston Jägermeister Music Tour  was stained at the Bank of America Pavilion.  There we go.  Did you used to do radio or something?  You got some, like, AC delivery there.  Hey, we got...  We got...  Boom boxes.  Way to jump on a boom box. 
[01:00:30]  Boom boxes.  Boom boxes.  Hey, all right.  If you guys want to win any of those prizes,  who's going to help us out today?  Oh, how about Tim?  Our intern from Springfield.  He used to commute from Springfield to New York Incurs.  Tim, here's the deal, guys, because everyone's getting hammered.  If you want to win one of those prizes that Don Wicklin just announced,  go up to Tim and tell him what you would do for the prize.  All right, get a pen and paper.  Maybe we got something pretty cool.  Oh.  I'm thinking maybe sniff wheelchair Fred's underwear for one of them. 
[01:01:00]  Ah.  It could be good, right?  God damn it.  No.  That can't ever be good.  Let's have an underpants sniffing contest.  We get Big A's underwear.  We get wheelchair Fred's underwear.  We get Twitchell's underwear.  Who do you think could be the worst?  It has to be wheelchair Fred, although Big A could be close second.  But wheelchair Fred's just, like, grinding it in all day.  Yeah.  You know.  Cranky-esque.  We could try.  You ever spend a lot of time in the computer, on the computer, playing a lot of computer games, 
[01:01:30]  maybe after a dump or so, and you don't feel so fresh?  Yeah.  You know?  That's what he does every day.  So, we're on to something here.  Yeah.  Underwear sniffing contest, or if your underwear smells worse than wheelchair Fred's, you get a prize.  There's something here.  I don't know what it is yet, but we'll try to figure it out.  You're working it out, Opie?  Let's try to work it out in our heads here.  How are we going to get Fred's underwear off, though? 
[01:02:00]  We just, I don't know.  Well, we could have him just kind of, kind of, all right.  Here we go.  I at least got how to do it.  See?  Now we're getting.  He's, of course, wheelchair bound, so we can't have him walk up here.  But he can lean over the stage, pull his pants down, and someone could just shove their nose up his, or something.  All right.  Fair enough.  I don't know.  Whatever it takes.  That's not a bad idea.  Wheelchair Fred, are you up for that?  Who's that guy?  Wheelchair Fred, are you up for that?  I'm up for anything. 
[01:02:30]  Who wants to sniff wheelchair Fred's underwear?  Wow.  We have a tanker.  Two tankers.  Would you do it?  All right.  Those guys will do it.  What do we give them if they sniff wheelchair Fred's underwear, Anthony?  Is that good enough for a boom box?  A boom box.  All right.  We'll give away a boom box if you sniff wheelchair Fred's underwear.  That's horrible.  All right.  We'll do that in a little while.  Okay.  Also, really fast.  No filter Paul's on stage, and he wants to give out some t-shirts. 
[01:03:00]  What do you got, no filter Paul?  I got six Bubbers of Cunt Shots.  What pizzazz he has.  Yankees suck!  Yankees suck!  Yankees suck!  You assholes, I'm from England.  Yankees suck!  I don't care.  I'm from England.  Yankees suck!  Hey, you assholes.  To him, that means we suck.  What, you're trying to say Americans suck? 
[01:03:30]  We're the fucking, we're the Yanks.  It's no filter Paul trying to say that Americans suck, Anthony.  Army is suck!  Army is suck!  They're chanting to an Englishman that Yankees suck.  Yeah.  You guys are fucking retarded.  I'm from England.  Fuck you!  Fuck the Yankees!  Fuck the Red Sox!  Oh, that's good, Paul.  That's good.  Get the whole room hating you.  That's really good.  All right.  Yet again, another really in-shape guy on stage. 
[01:04:00]  Jesus Christ.  How many shirts are you hiding onto that shirt?  Just a couple.  Hopefully all those...  We kind of will have that age look like yourself.  Get off your shirts!  Yeah.  I'm not in charge of this broadcast.  These guys are.  Well, will you throw it your stupid shirt?  Throw the shirts?  Yeah, this was supposed to be a 10-second thing.  Yeah.  Throw the shirts out, yeah.  It's not about you, douchebag.  Right.  Wow, he throws like a girl.  Anyone else noticing this?  Go ahead, throw it, look.  Yeah!  What a fucking... 
[01:04:30]  All right, hold on.  What is wrong with your arm?  I throw like a girl.  Fuck you.  What's wrong with your arm?  That's really how you throw?  I play baseball for a fucking living here.  You know England have a bad country.  Yeah, they don't play baseball because they throw like that.  Yeah.  Hey, I never saw a gay pride sticker in a car until I got to the mass turnpike.  Okay, faggots?  All right, thank you.  Thank you.  There you go.  No fouls.  There he goes.  I like how he got the retarded American Idol in the corner, Chris Daughtry and Taylor Hicks. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, let's bring them up real fast.  They're a visual, but...  The retarded version of American Idol.  Here you have.  Sonny Pirelli.  Here, bring them up on stage.  That's a good visual.  Here we go.  Anthony has noticed that these guys look like the retarded American Idols.  Ladies and gentlemen, your American Idol contestants, Chris Daughtry.  Chris Daughtry, everyone.  Turn around, Chris Daughtry.  And Taylor Hicks.  And Taylor Hicks. 
[01:05:30]  On the Planet Bizarro.  Get the fuck off.  All right, that's it.  We just want to make fun of you.  Get off the stage.  Yeah, that was just purely to make fun of you.  That's right.  That's right.  All right, you guys, we've got our first guest here.  A couple of guests here at Bill's Bar.  A mic needed.  We probably...  But Kenny's got to remove them because it's awkward.  Yeah.  Which is really funny for us.  They want to leave to applause, but it's just a fat man walking off the stage uneventfully. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, they were hoping to get something out of that.  Nothing.  You get nothing.  Hey, we got Buck Sherry here, guys.  Josh.  Yeah.  Josh and Keith from Buck Sherry.  Enjoying the party.  Oh, thanks, man.  Thanks, man.  What's happening?  Hey, Jimmy, what was that about?  There was a little whispering going on there.  He said he saw me working with Dice in Vegas, and he said he enjoyed the show a lot.  Of course.  But it wasn't this asshole.  It was Andrew Dice Clay that made the night of success. 
[01:06:30]  Okay?  Hey.  Hey.  Don't you fucking people have jobs?  Jesus.  That's right.  No, these guys are unbelievable.  Well, I got a Patriots Day or something.  It's like a legal fucking holiday.  We thought we were going to some fucking, like, you know, little studio, you know.  I mean, nobody else.  Sorry.  We apologize.  It's a fucking catastrophe out there.  We just rolled out of our bunks.  Is there something going on here today? 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  Apparently, there's going to be people running.  There's a bunch of people outside.  Yeah.  A couple of people out there.  And then they're going to all be wrapped in mylar later going, I did so well.  What was my time?  Shut the fuck up.  No one will care.  No one cares.  Unless you're a 90-pound Kenyan, no one gives a fuck about you.  Or unless you were Uta Pippig years ago, pissing, shitting, and having your period, puking, eye crust, snot, whatever else could come out of her body.  Does anyone remember that fine moment where Uta Pippig crossed the finish line? 
[01:07:30]  It was convulsing.  96, 97.  Yeah, 96, 97.  Me and Opie were at the finish line broadcasting for WAAF, ladies and gentlemen.  WAAF.  We were actually at Marianne's.  I have no idea.  I was intoxicated.  And we saw Uta Pippig run by, and everyone is cheering as she's coming up. 
[01:08:00]  You just hear the crowd because she's like one of the stars cheering, cheering.  When she got near the crowd, you just heard, yeah, yeah, like this groan down her leg.  She was wearing like super mini fucking shorts, and you just saw blood down the front, shit down the back, and she had vomited.  And this is something that you're supposed to do to show you're in shape. 
[01:08:30]  Remember the guys running behind the bar to take dumps in the middle of the race?  And then we saw some Asian guy running, running, and then he runs behind a building, squats, and just takes a dump on a girl's face while a guy was filming it.  And that girl was named Jimmy Norton.  Anyway, so back to Josh and Keith.  Yes, it's Patriots Day.  The rest of the country has to work, but everyone in Massachusetts gets the day off for some reason.  Because of running the marathon.  And then you got the Boston Red Sox across the street. 
[01:09:00]  Another day.  Where are you guys from?  Another reason to get loaded, right?  Another reason for Boston to get drunk.  Like you needed another.  We live in L.A.  L.A., okay.  Yeah.  That's a whole different head out there than the West Side, baby.  The Dodgers just suck.  All right, see?  And they'll chant it for you.  Dodgers suck!  Dodgers suck!  Dodgers suck!  But not with the same vigor that they get with the Yankees suck chant. 
[01:09:30]  Yankees suck!  Yankees suck!  Yankees suck!  Yankees suck!  Look.  Yankees suck!  We understand you're like the little brother that wants to be like the big brother.  We get it.  We understand.  I see buildings going up, new buildings.  You'll be Manhattan in no time.  I see the cranes building new stuff.  Give it 300 years.  Yes.  300, 400 years.  You'll have a metropolis. 
[01:10:00]  You'll be right there with us.  Yes.  You'll be the terrorist target, not the place they fucking leave from.  We won't live that one down, you bastards.  Hey, Logan Airport, come on in.  Come on in.  We'll let anyone through.  That should be their slogan.  You're on the watch list, but you got a hat with a B on it.  Get on the plane.  So, hey, is Johnny Damon a sore topic?  Oh, Johnny Damon.  You guys like Johnny Damon?  Johnny Damon. 
[01:10:30]  See how they turn.  See how they turn.  They're saying, you can have him.  You can have him.  He was their fucking hero.  Remember when he wouldn't cut his hair?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  He cut it when George said to cut it.  Cut that off.  You look like a faggot.  Slice.  To be a Yankee, yeah, he cut that hair.  Of course he did.  So, you guys just stumbled off the tour bus?  Did they give you a hotel?  What's going on?  We literally just stumbled off the tour bus.  Yeah.  Right into, you know.  Yeah, whatever the fuck this is. 
[01:11:00]  Whatever this is.  You know what makes it better?  And I got to tell you, Shottie Yeager.  You guys like Yeager?  I know it's like 9.30 in the morning and shit, but.  I'm going to have to pass on the morning Shottie Yeager.  Yeah.  Wow.  Hey.  I bet peer pressure works on you.  I'm sure Johnny Damon would take a shot.  They think we don't do this every fucking night.  Yeah, really.  I think this is a new idea for us. 
[01:11:30]  It's brand new.  They're trying to sober up for maybe one hour a day.  That's all.  We've got to tear you, son, you fucker.  What is that?  He said I should know if I could tear you.  Hey, you know what?  He said he wanted to eat my asshole.  Yeah, I think so.  How come the intelligent guys are always the loudest ones?  It's you right there, fucker.  I see you, fuckface.  Yeah.  You can't fucking hide.  A bunch of fucking smartasses, man.  Yeah, it is a little hard to drink on a Monday morning.  Sure.  Why are you guys in town? 
[01:12:00]  Are you doing a gig?  We've got a gig tomorrow night here.  Yeah, where are you working?  Where are we working?  We're playing in the Middle East tomorrow.  Oh, right on.  Great rock club, man.  Oh, that's actually a club.  I thought he was fucking around.  Where is that?  No, it's in Cambridge.  It's a great place.  What did you think?  He was flying over to the Middle East?  I thought he was just kidding.  You don't know anything about Boston.  It's a club.  It's a lame name for a club.  It's been around for a while.  Yeah.  It's a lame name, but it's a good club.  Now, the rat, that was a club.  The rat was fucking dope, man.  What the fuck, right? 
[01:12:30]  Love the rat.  Come on, it's the memories of throwing up on the floor of that place.  Everybody, right?  Am I wrong?  And now we're staying in the hotel that took over for the rat, right?  They took the rat out.  I can't believe that.  We played the rat.  Good move, Opie.  Good move.  What?  Tell them the hotel we're at.  Oh, like they're going to be, like we're the Beatles.  They're going to be running down the hallway trying to grab our underwear.  I know, but when you get a Ramone call at three in the morning, go fuck yourself.  That's right.  Ramone. 
[01:13:00]  Break Hughes' room, please.  Mr. Hughes, did you order room service?  No, I don't think I...  Ramone.  Send this man a cock on ice.  Ah, well, I'm disconnecting the phone now.  But I want to call you.  You guys got a new album out?  Are you working on one?  What are you doing?  Yeah, we got a record.  It came out April 11th.  It's called 15.  Kickstack. 
[01:13:30]  Cool, man.  Yeah.  See, they know.  Crazy Bitch.  Man.  There's a song called...  Yeah, Crazy Bitch is on it.  We like Crazy Bitch.  A song called Crazy Bitch that I think some of these people may have heard.  Yeah, definitely.  A lot of these people have heard Crazy Bitch.  So, from the look of this crowd, about noon, should be having some Hungry Sparrows up here, right?  Cool.  Ready to take down some of that stuff.  Yeah, by noon...  Change your oil.  Yeah, this is...  The closest I could get to this is kind of St. Paddy's Parade in New York City, where people start drinking real early. 
[01:14:00]  And you get staggering people, hungover people by noon.  They're like already nursing a hangover.  Right.  Because you just start drinking so early.  Because, uh...  Why?  I can understand St. Paddy's Day, but...  Yeah, we gotta drink because people are gonna be running.  Yeah.  And, uh...  You know, you gotta...  You gotta drink because other people will run today.  Are, uh, running and...  Yeah.  It really doesn't make sense at all. 
[01:14:30]  It makes no sense.  Why can't we have...  You've turned this into St. Paddy's Day.  Why can't we have a holiday like that in New York?  Nothing.  Marathon Day, what happens?  Nothing.  Nothing.  No one cares.  No one gives a shit.  No one cares.  Except for the people running.  All right.  We love it.  It starts at noon and you won't be able to move.  Have fun.  All day long.  Have fun.  Hey, what's up with the sausage fest in here, man?  Hey, that's what's been...  That has been our curse.  A lot of swinging dicks.  For years.  This is actually more chicks than we normally have. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, no.  This is...  This is a good turnout.  You've got, like, three...  You've got three...  You've got three blondes up here.  We need more chicks.  Somebody's hiding back there.  There's three...  And that's it.  It's guns to buns in here.  There's three cute blondes up front.  Any other girls you see, check them for dicks.  Right, right.  And then tell Jimmy, because they can make some money.  Hi, Daddy.  Hi, Daddy.  Hi, Daddy, Tats.  So what about a video?  We have a video for Crazy Bitch. 
[01:15:30]  It's on the website.  And it's on suicidegirls.com.  Buckcherry.com.  And buckcherry.com.  There's titties in it.  Oh.  I think you'll like it.  All right.  That's good.  R-rated version.  Is it a bitch to get anything on MTV?  It's kind of impossible.  Or does it even fucking matter anymore?  Every time we submit the video, they come back with, like, you know, 65 edits of too many  open leg shots or...  Well, if you were hip-hop showing, like, some fat booty and shit, then maybe you'd get 
[01:16:00]  some time.  I don't think it has to do with your content.  Right.  I think it has to do with the fact that maybe you're just a white rock band.  I think they're afraid of white booty.  Yeah.  White booty.  No one wants to swear.  And they don't even play the videos anymore anyway.  So they bust your balls for no reason.  Yeah.  Now there's like three videos in rotation.  They'd rather play that Sweet 16 show over and over again.  Ooh, hey.  Nothing wrong with that.  That's why fucking Satellite Radio kicks ass, man.  There you go.  Thank you, my friend.  Satellite Radio kicks ass.  Yeah.  Kicks ass. 
[01:16:30]  Satellite Radio kicks ass for a couple of weeks.  You guys were hanging out with my old roommate.  Jim Florentine?  Yeah.  You guys know Florentine well?  We played Irving Plaza and he came to the show and we all hung out.  With Laura?  It was dope.  Yeah.  Jimmy hung out with Jim.  I want our bass player.  With Laura?  I don't know.  Maybe he did.  Did he fucking help?  I don't know.  Hey, you guys are big fans of MySpace?  That's where you got the girls for Crazy Bitch?  That's right.  Oh, that's pretty cool. 
[01:17:00]  Nice.  What were the requirements?  That they beat 14 and not police officers.  You know what we did?  God, there are so many sluts on MySpace.  Oh, you gotta love it.  Fucking great.  But now, how did you determine who was really good on MySpace?  Because a lot of them, you know, they show one eye and half their nose and they're shot  and it looks kind of hot.  But then you look at the rest of their pictures and, well...  Let's just say we had a little auditioning process we put them through.  Oh, that's great. 
[01:17:30]  If you know what I mean.  Whenever they're...  You drop a little message and say, hey, you know, we're looking for chicks for a video  and you look...  We just gave an address, told them to show up, had an open bar at 10 a.m.  Took the hottest ones in and, like...  You know, you could do that and kill them.  Yeah, you could do that.  Did any fat shows show up?  No, actually, it was all very, very talented women.  Good.  It was beautiful.  That's a great idea, man.  MySpace is getting a bad rap, but it's really the place to go.  So if you want to get some chicks... 
[01:18:00]  If you want to get that sausage serviced, right?  Well, no.  This is the place for the sausage.  Yeah, this is the sausage fest.  Unfortunately.  I'm not saying you.  I'm not saying you, honey.  You know, miss, you're doing a lot of yelling for someone who's not showing her tits to the rock band.  There you go.  No?  No, no.  Okay.  All right, he moved the camera.  Drum roll, please.  Don't be a goose. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  God bless her.  Thank you, madam.  God bless her.  That's a good sport right there.  We know, you know...  Those are going to be nice someday.  Oh, Jimmy.  That's nice.  I'm kidding.  They're fantastic.  Inappropriate.  Now, we know it's not a total sausage fest.  Do you want to say something to him?  Too bad his dick's smaller than my tits.  Oh! 
[01:19:00]  Oh!  Oh, you're going to take that!  You're going to take that!  You're going to take that!  What's the matter?  What's coming to this?  Well, there's only one way to settle this.  That's right.  That's right.  You and me in a bathroom having a few laughs with you catching hepatitis.  No, I can't whip it out, but I'll get in trouble. 
[01:19:30]  She just asked you if she could pee on you.  Do you want to tinkle on me, Miss?  He's been known to enjoy that.  Yeah, he likes the tinkle.  He likes the tinkle.  She's a lovely girl.  Yeah, she's got better tits than me.  Oh.  She's still insulted by the tits thing.  Oh, I was only kidding.  You're a pressure fantastic.  You're a pressure fantastic.  Wait, shit.  Hey, Ben.  Give her a microphone.  Give her a fucking microphone.  I'll take that.  Shut up!  What were you saying? 
[01:20:00]  Oh, she's coming up.  Well, she's trying.  Oh.  Jimmy, show me a tits, baby.  I won't show you a tits unless you show them again.  You've got to show them in the crowd again.  I'm not showing the fucking crowd.  I'm not showing the crowd.  How about showing the crowd your hiney?  Show the crowd your hiney.  My hiney?  Your hiney.  Hiney.  Hiney.  Hiney.  Hiney.  Why not?  Just show them. 
[01:20:30]  This way.  Wow.  Are you fantastic?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can I see it?  Holy mackerel.  Hey, see, Jimmy?  Very nice.  Wow.  I lied.  But I'm sorry I said that about your breasts.  They're lovely.  Your breasts are very pretty.  Wow.  Wow, she just gave you the finger and everything.  There is nothing wrong with that, girl.  You are a fucking asshole.  There's nothing wrong with those breasts at all of you, Four Kings. 
[01:21:00]  They're fucking fantastic.  It's a tan, man.  That's what happens when you drink your breakfast.  That's really interesting.  See?  Any other girls want to show Buck Cherry a thing or two?  Hey, she's a team player.  That was good.  Three girls.  I think you've got to give a big hat.  She's a good sport.  Someone's got to give her some love for that.  Any other girls want to show Buck Cherry a thing or two?  Hey.  A thing or two about a thing or two?  A thing or two?  I say two about her thing or two.  Do we have another contestant? 
[01:21:30]  Maybe we could have the craziest bitch contest.  Apparently we have two more contestants.  With all five of these girls.  Oh, fuck.  All right.  Well, we're going to have a...  I guess we're going to have a crazy bitch contest.  Oh, wow.  Shit.  There we go.  We're going to do a crazy bitch contest.  All right.  For Buck Cherry, we've got Josh and Keith playing in the Middle East tonight.  Yeah.  We have to get their names.  Of course, we have...  Let's see the talent.  Kara from MySpace was never wowed on camera before.  And are you going to wow, too? 
[01:22:00]  Lisa?  Lisa?  Is that mic even on?  I can barely...  Okay.  They're just speaking softly.  This one's going to be nice.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's good.  A little lesbian action on the stage.  It's not going to hurt anybody.  Jesus Christ.  They are making out.  I'll say that.  It looks sincere.  It looks like Lowe.  That's good.  Like, a lot of girls that do that shit, but that looks sincere.  More.  More.  More.  More.  More.  More.  More.  Yeah. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Second base.  Second base.  Second base.  Second base.  I can't believe I'm in my 40s.  Second base.  Hey, are you guys real buns?  Yeah.  Hey, ladies.  Buck Cherry has a question for you.  Josh and Keith.  Are you guys real buns?  No.  No.  No?  Oh, God.  I don't believe you.  Show the rug.  Show the rug.  Show the rug.  Wow.  That's it. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Is there a rug there?  Oh, Opie and Anthony panties.  Opie and Anthony panties.  Opie and Anthony panties.  My mom would be so proud.  Oh, it's fucked up about the Opie and Anthony panties.  The guys are wearing them, too.  Oh, sorry.  You guys could have these girls.  I could shoot.  It's good with those shows, too.  All right.  You're absolutely right.  With a rupee and some duct tape, we could have those girls. 
[01:23:30]  Now, Opie and Anthony panties, the panties, they come with a snail trail already.  Already in them.  Yeah.  We don't fuck out.  Oh, the girls are making out a little more.  A little more over there.  Any other girls want in on the Crazy Bitch Contest that we just started?  So far, everybody's been great.  Crazy bitch.  That's sexy bitch.  Any other ladies in the back?  Any ladies in the back?  Anyone?  We got Buck Cherry on the stage, Josh and Keith.  Bueller.  Bueller.  Who cares about chicks kissing? 
[01:24:00]  Hey, faggot, why don't you come up here and you can kiss wheelchair Fred's cock.  We like chicks kissing.  That's right.  Oh, I'm sorry.  It was Mark Perrano yelling that out.  I really didn't realize.  Congrats on, you know, your prison sentence.  Congrats on surviving jail thus far.  Any other ladies for the Crazy Bitch Contest?  Anyone in the back? 
[01:24:30]  Feeling crazy?  Aw, man, we're going to look bad.  Will one woman just come up here and pick up a bottle with her vagina, please?  Just one?  Nothing?  Nothing?  Nothing?  No.  That's all right.  Dude, the more they have to drink, then the crazier they get.  Well, they're not going to hang out all morning, though.  They're fucking rock stars.  They're not going to wait for you.  They've got things to do.  They're also going to pick things up with their badges.  All right.  How about a fat girl?  Can a fat girl pick up a bottle with the back of your neck? 
[01:25:00]  I'd like to see that.  That'd be fun.  Any fat chicks here today?  BK's New York.  BK's New York.  Yeah?  Fuck me, Louie on HBO.  Love me.  Thank you, son.  Now they're just shouting things out.  The Opian Anthony Show has always appreciated the fat chick.  Where is she?  I know there's one here.  And you're not fooling anyone. 
[01:25:30]  Exactly.  You don't walk in saying, maybe they won't know I'm the fat chick.  They know.  Come on, lady.  Where are you?  Where is fatty?  Where is fatty?  Where is fatty?  Fat chick appreciation day.  Hey, fat chicks need love, too.  They certainly do.  She even comes in with a mannequin head on her shoulder so it looks like two people and  nobody will notice.  Come on up here.  We promise not to ridicule you and point out how unfuckable you are. 
[01:26:00]  Come on, a free XM ham.  Nothing doesn't.  Tuggy chasers up here.  Why don't we, we'll give you the XM skateboard.  You can stand on it and break it.

[01:30:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back live at Bill Sparrow in Boston.  It has definitely reached Boston on this fine Patriots Day. 
[01:31:00]  Ah, go fuck yourself.  Oh, food.  Nice.  Ooh, goodies.  Also, the Red Sox starting in, what, an hour?  That's crazy.  That's crazy.  Now you're just talking crazy.  Fucking crazy.  Once again, I want to thank Buck Cherry for stopping by.  Hey, they didn't know what they were getting themselves into.  Yeah, they expected a radio studio interview, and they got this madhouse.  They got this.  That's fun, though.  Josh and Keith, they're playing the Middle East tomorrow night. 
[01:31:30]  I kept saying tonight, so.  Hey, Anthony has a story about Wheelchair Fred he was telling me just before he came back.  Yeah, this is what I heard.  Wheelchair Fred always has problems getting places because, well, he's crippled.  Let's bring him up on stage for this, actually.  I, I...  Could you guys lift Wheelchair Fred up on the stage for a minute?  There you go.  This always goes well.  We need some big boys to lift the whole wheelchair up on the stage.  It looks like he's gained some weight since last time we've seen him. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, what the fuck, Fred?  Wait, you don't need the chair.  Just drag him up.  Oh, here he goes.  Ladies and gentlemen, heel.  Heel, Fred.  You can walk.  No, not again.  There he goes.  Same way you'd put a sack of potatoes up on a loading dock.  All right, now stand up, Fred.  Only one is less important.  We should have him just sit there all day. 
[01:32:30]  Don't even give him the wheelchair anymore.  Hey, somebody smell that seat.  Somebody smell that wheelchair seat.  Sniff the seat.  Sniff the seat.  Get him up.  There it is.  Get him up on stage.  That's good.  Oh, he's trying to get up on his own again.  That never works, Fred.  Come on, Fred.  You can keep trying.  Get up on there.  You think that wheelchair seat smells?  Yeah, I think so.  You can do it!  We got something better planned than sniffing that seat. 
[01:33:00]  Fred is now sitting on the stage.  The wheelchair is up here also.  He's trying to roll.  Whoa, he's standing.  Kind of.  Fred, Fred!  Oh, this is going to be good.  Come on, Fred.  You're almost there.  His pants are falling down.  Fred, Fred, Fred!  Come on, Fred.  Come on, Fred.  Fred just knocked the camera over.  He's slowly but surely making his way up to his wheelchair.  And no one's helping him.  There it goes.  Punched out of Kenny with his sense.  Kenny just threw him into the chair. 
[01:33:30]  Kenny just threw him into the chair.  Hello, Mom.  What?  Hello, Mom.  Hello, Love.  Hello, Love?  Hello, Love.  Hello, Love.  Now, he has a hard time getting from point A to point B because he's got no money.  And if it's any distance, he can't really roll there.  Yeah.  So this time...  He has been known to roll, though.  Yeah.  On what is it?  Route 9?  Route 9.  Yeah, he's been rolling down Route 9 sometimes, almost getting hit, unfortunately. 
[01:34:00]  He's still here.  Yeah.  But, uh...  Well, no, I...  He had enough shut up.  He had enough for, uh, cab fare, but, like, one way.  He's only got cab fare one way.  He always decides to show up somewhere without any plan on how to get home.  So I don't know how he gets his money, but he had enough for one way.  Uh, apparently, the cab pulls up, uh, Sonny Pirelli's out there.  And Sonny, uh, the cab driver's asking for the money, and Sonny says, uh, he's got AIDS. 
[01:34:30]  He told the cab driver that wheelchair Fred had AIDS, and the cab driver, like, recoiled  and said, keep your money, keep your money, and, like, shoved him out.  So, apparently, he's got cab fare to get home now, because the cab driver didn't want to  take his AIDS-ridden money.  Which, by the way, is such a typical Boston story.  You guys are very understanding here.  I told, I told the cab driver that he had full-blown AIDS. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, I like it.  Okay.  Wow.  Fred.  Yeah, Fred.  Look at the hair growing off the side of his ear.  He's long.  Wow, Fred, you got ear hair, like, severe.  Like Peter Boyle.  Peter Boyle.  I like you.  I thought he had, like, long hair in the back, and I was, you know, pushing forward.  That's really a pussy.  Gross.  All right, we got, uh, wow.  Wow.  Yeah, put that right up against his ear hair. 
[01:35:30]  Ew.  Oh, my God.  Oh, is that disgusting.  Fucking Crypt Keeper.  Wow.  That is a hairy ear.  That is pretty creepy.  I'm sorry.  You might want to trim that up there, Fred.  Can't you just trim it?  Let's go.  But I got to tell you.  I've been six lefties on tonight.  Fred, how'd you get so fat?  What happened?  What do you think?  I'm kidding.  I was fat.  You got fat. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, you weren't always that fat.  Way to make him feel bad about his body, Ann.  I looked good.  Yeah?  You looked good?  You eating?  I looked good.  Hey, uh, Anthony.  Yeah.  A little earlier, we asked the audience what they would do for the fine prizes we have  at Bill's Bar tonight.  Right.  Including tickets to see Stained, courtesy of the Jägermeister Music Tour and other XM stuff  like Boomboxes and Sky 5-2s. 
[01:36:30]  And I got the list in front of me.  We have a guy that's willing to sniff Fred's underpants.  Holy shit, you're kidding.  Right there, you.  The guy's got it.  He has an empty cup with a lime at the bottom and two swizzle sticks.  Something tells me Diet Pepsi wasn't in there.  All right, so we got that, Anthony.  We also have Rich.  He will let Jim fart in his face.  You got any farts brewing there, Jimmy?  Can you fart on Q?  No, I can't.  Damn it. 
[01:37:00]  He can flee.  Maybe if there is someone here that can fart on Q, we can use him.  All right.  All right.  And also, we got Randy.  He'll put Fred's undies in his mouth.  Holy shit.  No way.  Fred, can you get those...  Can you somehow get the underwear off?  That seems like a chore.  What is that around your waist?  A fanny pack.  No, we can do...  No!  We can cut the underwear and then just...  Absolutely. 
[01:37:30]  Like it's a fucking...  Like he's an accident victim.  Yeah, can we cut your underwear off and get them out?  Cut the middle and then the waistband.  Cut the side.  Cut it down the side.  Cut the side and down the side.  Cut the two sides and then it'll come off like a diaper.  The back, the important part, is still intact.  Yes.  Anyone have a scissor or anything like that?  Or anyone with a knife that's not drunk?  Oh, Christ.  All right.  So we got that.  That's going to happen in a little while.  Kenny's got a Swiss Army knife. 
[01:38:00]  Kenny has a knife and scissors.  Well, who the hell is going to do this, though?  Kenny.  All right.  Wheelchair Fred.  Club Soda.  Unbutton those slacks.  He's undoing his pants.  All right.  Give the mic to Club Soda Kenny.  Now, Fred, hold on.  Don't pull your pants down.  We don't need a seat.  We don't need your pants to be down.  All we need...  All we need is your underwear.  Is your underwear.  Now, this can be surgically removed without having to take your pants off.  But now, listen to me.  Fred.  Fred.  How long have you been wearing the same pair of underwear?  I've got it for you. 
[01:38:30]  I'm waiting.  Honest.  Four hours.  That's it?  Did you shower?  Did you shower last night?  I did this morning.  You showered.  Now he's all fucking clean.  I bet someone else is more filthy than him.  I'll stay from the back.  This guy right here.  That's the way to ruin it.  Did you have any chili last night or anything that might make this interesting?  Yeah.  No, thank you.  How about Big A's underpants?  Ant.  He's got to have cranky ass. 
[01:39:00]  Big A?  No, he's got cranky ass.  And even your underpants.  I will guarantee in four hours he's got something going on down there.  You lick your ass.  Now he's telling the pretty girls that he'd lick their ass.  Either that or the guys.  Lick your ass.  Who wouldn't lick her ass, Fred?  Way to stretch.  Yeah, right.  What a stretch.  What a reach, Fred.  Fred goes, I'll lick your ass, and then gives the come here finger.  How about if Lady Di was sitting there, would you still be saying, I'll lick your ass?  No. 
[01:39:30]  All right, let's take Fred's underpants off.  And we'll see what's going on there.  Hey, Big A, how long have you been wearing your undershorts?  Big A?  Four days?  Four hours.  Everyone's on the four-hour mark with their underwear.  But like Opie said, wheelchair Fred has to have cranky ass.  I'm guaranteeing there's something going on, because he doesn't wipe well to begin with.  I think four hours is plenty.  All right, pump soda candy, take the, pump soda candy, everyone, is now. 
[01:40:00]  All right, we're getting some late-breaking news on Twitchell's underwear.  What's up with Twitchell's underwear?  Twitchell's has been wearing his underwear since 3 a.m.  Where's Twitchell's?  So, uh...  He can shit when he has to.  Look at this.  All right.  This is not right.  Oh, my God.  Here comes his underwear.  This is not right.  Oh, Jesus.  Someone get those from him immediately.  I don't care if you need gloves. 
[01:40:30]  Hey, Fred, throw them to Anthony.  No.  If you do, I'll kill you.  I swear I'll kill you as you sit.  All right, someone study the underwear.  Is there anything going on there at all?  Now, study the important part.  Any skid marks?  The band is dirty.  You wear sexy underwear.  All right.  Well, you know what?  I'm not seeing any real problems there.  If there was anything going on, this place would have just went nuts.  That should look like a shoeshine rag, but it's really...  All right. 
[01:41:00]  You know what?  Who else wants to give up their underwear for the contest?  Now we have to go to the bullpen.  Who might have a skid mark they want to show?  Who?  Who else?  Let's go!  Let's check out Big A's underwear.  Big A.  All right, let's get up here.  Don't be shy.  Big A!  You'll be compensated.  You will be...  We'll financially compensate you for your underwear.  We'll buy them from you.  Who else might have some problems in their underwear?  You got to take one for the team today. 
[01:41:30]  Twitchels?  Twitchels, what do you think?  Yeah, well, I started getting ready to leave for my commute around 3 a.m., so that's when  I put mine on.  Yeah.  Any dumps from the time you...  I took...  Actually, I took a crap right before they started letting people in.  There could be a problem there, then.  Could be.  Could be.  All right, well, maybe we can place his...  Keep track on whose it is.  All right.  Keep that.  Who else wants to give up their underwear for the contest? 
[01:42:00]  Mine are clean.  They don't smell.  All right, well...  Twitchels, you want to give up your underwear?  All right, hold on.  We got a good idea.  Get a chair.  Get a chair.  We got a good idea here.  Maybe a good itch.  A good, satisfying itch before you take your underwear off.  The type where you push the finger in and close your chin.  Yeah, like scratch.  Scratch real hard.  Get a good one.  All right, let's get a...  And then take the underwear off.  Let's get a chair on stage so Twitchels can sit down and so clubs go to Kenny, kid. 
[01:42:30]  Give yourself a good, deep itch, son.  Cut his underwear off.  You know the itch that makes you almost feel like scratching like a dog?  Yeah.  The real good one.  Did you itch?  Did you give a nice itch?  Dig in there.  Stand up.  Give yourself a wedgie.  You can do it through your pants.  Puck Soda, give him a wedgie.  Oh, my God, he's going to fall over.  Holy shit. 
[01:43:00]  That was an atomic wedgie.  Wow.  Jump!  Jump!  Jump!  And there he goes, put his jump in because he has to.  Puck Soda Kenny getting a wedgie right up to his neck.  Twitchels, through the pants, through your pants.  Give a good itch.  Oh, there's a problem here.  He's got black underwear.  Oh, shit.  Look at that.  That's the whole smell.  All right, Kenny, cut Twitchels' underwear off.  Oh, my God.  All right, sit down, Twitchels.  Sit down.  Sit down.  Here we go.  Anyone else have underwear that may be a problem? 
[01:43:30]  Make your way to the stage.  Twitchels.  Oh, he's going to twitch, and he's going to take out his liver.  All right, we're cutting.  This is ridiculous.  We're cutting Twitchels' underwear off him.  All right, Tom.  Oh, God damn.  He's twitching like a motherfucker.  You are going to stab this guy.  And the sick fans are making him jump as Club Soda Kenny is trying to cut his underwear.  He'll jump. 
[01:44:00]  All right, pull those underwear out.  Go, go, go.  Yeah.  All right, let's take a look.  Jesus Christ, like a T-shirt.  Let's take a look.  Club Soda Kenny, anything going on with Twitchels' underwear?  Besides being the biggest pair.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Turn it around.  Turn it around.  Let me see.  What's that?  There's a whitish spot.  Did you do J-O?  That's like white shit, dude.  And have a little fluid.  That's Hobocom. 
[01:44:30]  All right.  All right.  That is really grossing me out.  All right.  All right, put those over there.  So far, 0 for 2.  Any other...  You have the snip test.  Anyone else have some underwear they're willing to give up for the contest?  You will be compensated for the loss of your underwear.  Anyone else?  Anyone else, no?  All right, well...  Anthony is taking...  Yeah, we got like, you know, how much is underwear?  Not you. 
[01:45:00]  You already gave.  You already gave.  You lost out.  Anyone else have some problems?  Ladies and gentlemen, we're offering $20.  Wait, they're pointing to someone in the back room.  We might save this contest yet.  We got someone that's going to help us out back there.  Come on to the stage.  Make room.  Make room.  There has to be one filthy person in this whole bar.  One filthy person.  One filthy person.  It's our brand new bitch, man.  A filthy animal with just three-day-old underwear.  Yeah.  All right, someone's making it up to the stage, I believe. 
[01:45:30]  Yellow in the front.  One dirty red socks, man, with filthy underpants.  One sweaty, nervous anus.  Wow.  Is this a guy or...  Who is this person of questionable gender?  All right.  Come on up.  All right, this guy will be called.  Holy shit.  It looks like Laird in drag.  Hey, almost Bono.  Come up here.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  Hey, Denny Lee, get up here. 
[01:46:00]  I'm not sure if this is a girl or a guy.  Whatever you are, get up here.  How are you?  Get up here.  How are you?  All right, turn around.  Turn around to the crowd.  Turn around.  Turn around now.  Fucking hairdo is all the way.  Wow.  All right, Twitchels, get up.  What's wrong, Twitchels?  Get him, friends.  Shit, man.  He stinks?  Literally, I'm not kidding.  Ladies and gentlemen, Blue Oyster cult's Buck Dahmer.  I'm burning, I'm burning, I'm burning. 
[01:46:30]  For you.  Hi, mister.  Well, Twitchels said this guy stinks, and who, does he stink back there?  Does he stink it?  Yeah.  Sir, sir, what happened now?  When was the last time you showered?  About 4 a.m.  4 a.m.  Have you taken a dump since then?  No, I haven't, but I'm almost close.  So your turtle head may be poking out?  Well, I've been drinking a lot of Guinness, so it's very possible.  Now, why are the people saying that maybe there's an odor coming off of you? 
[01:47:00]  There shouldn't be.  I'm totally clean.  It's a he-shee!  All right.  He-shee's possible.  It's a he-shee!  Have you been mistaken for an older woman?  Yes, I have.  Jesus Christ.  Why don't you maybe cut your hair like a guy?  I like it this way.  Do you?  No, you don't.  Yeah, I do.  You've got to ace that hair.  Yeah, I do.  And, Chris, if you're listening, the chappers suck.  All right.  All right.  Whatever that is.  Now, what you've got to do, get up, dig in, give a good scratch. 
[01:47:30]  Wait, no.  No, like right...  No, no, no, no.  Hey, but Kenny, give him a wedgie.  Dig in there, sir, slash...  Through your pants, give a scratch.  Right at ground zero.  They're calling for it, Anthony.  All right.  Here comes a wedgie.  They're calling for the club star to Kenny Wedgie.  Oh, wow.  Kenny's...  Oh, shit. 
[01:48:00]  Sir, sir, did you pee your pants?  No, I did not.  Why is it wet in front?  Hey, turn around.  No, he's just having his period.  Oh, his underwear, I'm hanging out.  Hey, this is past.  No, I didn't.  Somebody bumped into me when I had a new Guinness.  Oh, shit.  All right, can we take your underwear off of you?  Yeah, let Kenny cut your underwear off.  All right.  Sit down and let Kenny cut your underwear off of you.  What a fucking awful radio show I'm talking about.  This is the worst thing we've ever done. 
[01:48:30]  Show me your pussy!  Show me your pussy.  Oh, he's got bikinis.  Yeah.  Wait, are those panties?  Are those panties, sir?  Are you wearing panties?  Opie, I just saw something.  What?  He pulled his panties down, which he is wearing.  Panties.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Kenny, what is that?  Hold on, hold on. 
[01:49:00]  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on, we got a photo op for everybody.  Turn around.  Photo op.  Show him your ass.  What is that?  There is a golf ball.  Sir, what is the golf ball on your ass?  Turn that way, turn that way.  Turn up this way.  It's a fucking hemorrhoid the size of a hornet-ness.  And it's like on his hip.  What is that?  It's pooped out of his ass. 
[01:49:30]  What is that?  What is that goiter?  What is that?  Wait, wait, get him a mic.  I don't know.  I've taken it to a doctor.  They won't take it off because of the area it's on.  Why?  What's wrong with the area?  Oh, no.  They just said it's a place that could get infected if they suture it off.  There's a lot of dirt down there.  It just grosses them out.  They won't go near it.  Yeah, the doctor didn't even want to touch it.  Now, what's this yellow stain on your shirt?  No, no, look.  Somebody bumped into the front.  Oh, Guinness also.  I have your fresh Guinness.  Somebody bumped into the front.  Let me tell you what happened. 
[01:50:00]  When he was taking the panties off, which they are, panties, I caught a glimpse of what could  be an infantile penis and testicles.  Wait, wait.  Sir.  Not quite, but very close.  You have some kind of problem where your genitals are very small for a man.  I'm standing in front of a bunch of guys, yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, he was pulling them down, and before he pulled them back up, I caught a glimpse  of something that looked like something a mom might see changing an infant. 
[01:50:30]  Yes.  Standing in front of a bunch of manless, of course it's going to shrink.  Wow.  Do you have a hormone thing going on?  A little bit, yes.  A little hormone thing.  Are you a gay man?  No, hell no.  All right.  But do you have a problem with female hormones, maybe breasts, or?  Yes, I have.  Do you have breasts?  Minor.  Minor?  Minor.  Can we see that?  What do you have for breakfast?  It's not that bad. 
[01:51:00]  It's not that bad.  You've got, like, big pink nipples.  Yeah.  There's big pink nipples and some kind of underlying.  Did you ever have surgery to reduce them?  No.  All right.  All right.  Maybe in the future.  Can we get you something like a shot of testosterone?  Yeah.  You just really need.  Sorry to come from you, Jimmy.  All right, listen.  Kenny was holding up.  Hold it.  Are those panties you were wearing?  No, they're not.  They're not panties?  What are those?  They're like silk. 
[01:51:30]  Kenny, bring the panties back up.  Look at the label on the panties.  All right.  This is what we cut.  Dude, you're wearing women's underwear.  It says Victoria's Secret right on the label.  Holy shit.  Dude, you're wearing...  Oh, my God.  I smell it from here.  All right.  Get the fuck away from me.  Get it away from me.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  What's wrong, man?  What's wrong?  Dude, get it away.  I can smell it.  What's wrong?  What's wrong?  Oh, my God.  I smell it from here.  Wait, put it away, Anthony.  Shit, I can't run away.  I'm wired in.  No, get the fuck away from me.  I'll kill someone. 
[01:52:00]  I swear I'll fucking...  Hold it by Anthony so you can see it.  No, get it away from me.  I can't smell this.  They're given to me by an ex-girlfriend.  It smells like an underarm.  Oh, my God.  He's...  He's now saying that he got the panties from an ex-girlfriend.  Ex-girlfriend?  Yes, and I'm still good friends are there.  Did you pull it off her body after she was dead for about a week?  Because those smell awful.  Who did you date?  She was very happy with him.  I got me laid.  I bet her name was Pat.  We know how Jimmy likes him.  I've already heard those stories a hundred times.  Dude, there is no way you're pegging anything on Jimmy. 
[01:52:30]  You are a one of a kind here.  Yeah, we like...  Thank you, sir.  We like this guy.  What's his name?  Yeah, what's your name?  Johnny Tork on Blackback.  A and Pro Bonas.  Johnny...  Oh, really?  Johnny Tork.  Okay.  Johnny Tork, everyone.  Johnny Tork.  Okay.  Wow.  All right, I think we found the underwear.  Those underwear are throwing something off, though.  Maybe it was the wedgie or something.  It had to be the wedgie.  Do you clean back there very well?  Very well, and I was fresh in the shower today.  Goddamn psycho mark.  I bet you they got goiter juice on it. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, there's got to be goiter juice or something.  All right.  Have they told you what that tumor is?  It's not a tumor.  It's just a body mark, and they said, if I cut it off from where it is, it could very  well get an infection if I wipe it properly.  Anthony...  So they don't recommend taking it off.  It's a speed bump to the top.  Jeez, you're acting like I'm twitchels or something.  All right, look.  Anyone else want to give up their underwear for the contest?  Underwear, underwear.  We're looking for...  Well, you never know, but I think we found the underwear that we need.  Yeah, that was a good one. 
[01:53:30]  Anyone else?  Thank you, sir.  How about no filter Paul?  He's got to be...  English people are very gamey.  Yeah, hello.  Paul.  How about Paul?  Paul.  Paul.  Europeans are known for not really stour in.  Fucking filthy overseer.  Dirty animals.  All right.  That uncoward sucks.  All right, let's hear it for Johnny, first of all.  All right, Johnny, little dick, great job.  Goodbye.  You got your underwear?  That's right.  Fucking wearing panties and drinking estrogen.  No, I swear, his, like, yam bag... 
[01:54:00]  It's all stuff.  And he had the piercing.  Everything was lit.  It was so tiny.  It's disgusting.  It looks like one of those old bombs.  What is it?  The fuse?  It's an old time, yeah.  Like an old time spy versus spy bomb.  Yeah, that's what it was.  I'm trying to remember.  All right.  Unbelievable.  Dude, why are you sticking your fucking tongue out at guys?  What are you doing?  No, he's getting ready.  He's preparing. 
[01:54:30]  The smell of the underpants.  All right.  Let's, uh...  Ben.  Ben.  Let's get a mic to this guy, please.  Get rid of him.  All right, what's your name?  Johnny.  Johnny?  Yep.  And what were you, what are you willing to do here?  I was going to sniff some panties.  Well, you're going to sniff the panties that the guy was wearing.  Oh, yeah.  The guy with a hemorrhoid.  That was no hemorrhoid.  Whatever it was.  That was beyond, that was like... 
[01:55:00]  Uh, that was a goiter.  That was like Twado.  Yep.  Which was like Coado.  Ass-o!  Just ass-o.  Yeah.  That's about it.  I don't know what that thing is, but I pray to God it's malignant.  Takes over his body.  So what do you want to do?  Kenny, bring out the underwear.  Bring out the underwear.  Let's get Johnny on stage.  What do you want to win, Johnny?  We have a choice of, uh, what are the prizes again?  John, what do you want to win? 
[01:55:30]  I already have the boombox and, uh, the sky fight, so...  He stands like a superhero.  Oh, shit.  Doesn't he?  Hey, get those panties here.  All right, well...  We'll give him something.  Oh, my God.  Kenny just wrapped the Victorian secret.  It smells delicious.  Nasty fucking man-woman panties.  Shit!  Shit!  Shit! 
[01:56:00]  Shit!  Shit!  Shit!  Shit!  Shit!  Why?  Shit!  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Now, uh, sir, what does that smell like?  Asshole!  What does it smell like?  What does it smell like?  Serious.  It smells like cabbage.  It smells like cabbage.  Hey, Jimmy!  Punch him in the fucking house!  It smells like Jimmy's queash.  Yeah, it's me!  I'm very hygienic, sir, in my asshole in the ball area.  Oh, wow, that is disgusting. 
[01:56:30]  Puffs out of Kenny and the panties all over his face.  He's having a rough time with it now, though.  Look, he doesn't really want to get involved.  I think he hit ground zero on it.  Yeah, Kenny.  Kenny, where is ground zero on that?  Where's ground zero on those?  Right in the middle.  I think it's more that.  All right, right in your mouth like a horse bit.  Right in your mouth.  Oh, this is horrible. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, it's the worst catastrophe I've ever seen.  Oh, very, very good.  That is horrific.  Let's hear it for Johnny, man.  Well, Johnny, Johnny's going to win something for that.  I've never seen anything so repulsive in my life.  Yeah.  Hey, you know what we should do live here?  We should do a Trichols bit.  A Trichols bet.  Oh, yeah.  You want to see how quiet Trichols could get? 
[01:57:30]  You guys want to make a little side money among your friends?  We like doing this on the radio.  We're going to try it live for the first time.  Trichols, as you know, has a really tough time keeping quiet.  So we're going to bet and see how long he can keep quiet before he has to do his dress thing.  What do you say?  I bet one second. 
[01:58:00]  How about, why don't we get some bets going here?  All right.  I got...  He's very active today.  Very tense.  He's all amped up.  Actually, you know what?  Why don't we let the listeners bet?  Why don't we get like five, I don't know, up to ten people up to the stage?  We're going to talk to them next.  They're from Barstool Sport.  Nothing but the best guests for the Opie and Anthony show.  We're on the road, by the way.  Psycho Mark's molesting them.  Great to see him back.  All right.  Why don't we...  You know what? 
[01:58:30]  Here's the deal.  All right.  We'll take a break.  We need someone that's working for the show.  I don't even know who's working for the show right now to get their money.  It's a $5 bet.  You guys got to figure out how long Quichels will keep quiet.  Whoever's closest will win all the money.  A quick little bet, okay?  Right.  We'll do that, and we'll also talk to the girls from Barstool Sports in just a few minutes.  Stay there.  It's Opie and Anthony live from Bill's Bar in Boston.  Let's hear it, guys.  It's Patriots Day, and we're having a good time. 
[01:59:00]  We'll continue in just a bit.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony live from Boston, Massachusetts.  They constantly portray abnormal sexual behavior as being normal.  It's like pinning down an alcoholic and pouring vodka down his throat.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, yeah.  She's a woman, you know what I mean.  You better listen, I don't listen to me.  She's gonna say she's a baby.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:59:30]  What do you think, guys?  You having a good time or what, huh?  We're having a good time here in Boston.  Bill's Bar, Patriots Day, the Opie and Anthony virus.  Having a great time.  We've got Twichels on the stage.  We're gonna do a quick bet for some money for what lucky, man?  Also, we got the girls from Bar School Sports.  We're gonna talk to them in a couple minutes.  And we gotta say hi to an old friend. 
[02:00:00]  An old friend wants to stay high.  Oh, yeah.  Give him a microphone.  It's been a while.  Been a while, man.  Too long.  Give him a microphone and watch the magic.  Ladies and gentlemen, Psycho Mark!  Yeah!  Psycho Mark!  Tack, tack, tack.  Psycho Mark's been drinking.  Where's his mic?  God damn it.  Twichels twitched and fucked the mic up.  The microphone doesn't work, so...  Get my headset. 
[02:00:30]  Another person that wasn't allowed to do his catchphrase.  He's got his catchphrase, too.  I'm not even gonna do it.  I'm not even gonna do it.  I'm not even gonna do it.  Welcome to Boston, guys.  Welcome back to Beantown.  Go Sots!  Go Sots!  Yeah!  Fuck the Yankees!  Oh, my God.  He hasn't changed.  And fuck Johnny Damon, too.  That faggot that's got a haircut.  Fuck the Yankees!  He's now a cum-guzzling Yankee. 
[02:01:00]  Yankee, Yankee, Yankee, Yankee, Yankee.  Now, where can we take him out and do some jumps on the tracks all back over here?  You wanna put him on the train tracks?  I think the 935's coming by.  What was it?  Psycho Mark representing Boston perfectly, by the way.  Psycho Mark's been drinking a lot of Guinness.  Now, wait a minute.  Does the mayor know that you guys are back in town?  I don't know.  I think they give him meetings and stuff and important things to do so he doesn't know we're back.  My name is Thomas Benito.  I'm opening an anthem and I'm back in town. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  I love him here.  Wait a minute.  I died in the car wreck.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Hey, hey.  Can you do your Ben impression?  Oh, Ben.  Let's do a Ben impression.  Oh, Ben.  Oh, Ben.  We're smelling shit.  We're smelling crap.  Hey, you guys need a paper?  You guys need a paper?  Hold on.  Hold on.  It's fine.  It's fucking fine.  Shut up.  Hey, Mark.  What do you think of the girls?  We're going to interview from Marstool Sports.  Honestly, why did we not sniff their panties? 
[02:02:00]  Why were we sniffing things?  I don't get it.  That is the most important thing I've ever heard you say.  Do you know what she told me?  She's not wearing any panties.  Holy Jesus.  Hey.  By the way, is there any girls out there that want their panties cut off?  Yeah, we didn't ask the girls if they want any panties cut off and put over people's  heads like Jimmy Norton.  Come on, it's friggin' Patriots Day.  Patriots, go Pats.  I don't think that's what it's about. 
[02:02:30]  Oh.  What are you talking about?  It's Patriots Day.  Go fuck yourself and go fuck Ben Thierry.  Fuck Ben Thierry.  He sucks.  Holy shit.  And so do the Yankees.  Go fuck the Yankees.  He's the king of the cheats here.  He's out of control.  Actually, testically, it's evacuation day.  The evacuation day?  Of what?  The Irish?  What?  Get the Irish out of town.  It's evacuation day.  There's no more Guinness. 
[02:03:00]  You all gotta run in the marathon.  Speaking of which, where's the wheelchair guy?  Is he in the marathon today?  Wheelchair Fred's over there.  Now, Fred passed out or something.  What?  He's either passed out or dead.  Well, come on.  We still got time to get him to Harkington.  All right, hold on.  Get him out to Harkington.  He can run with the Hoyt kid.  All right, Mark.  Hold on one second.  Oh, the Hoyt kid still runs?  Oh, come on.  That's not.  Hey, that's the only way I want to go in a marathon.  In a fucking wheelchair.  All right, hold on.  Here's wheelchair Fred. 
[02:03:30]  Mike, don't work.  Wheelchair Fred again.  Yeah, another mic that's not working.  A lot of mic casualties today.  All right.  Anyway.  I think what he said was push me out on the tracks.  Here we go.  Why are you falling asleep, Fred?  I guess he should try.  Kill yourself.  I don't want to bring it out.  All right.  Well, that explains it.  I'll be billed by. 
[02:04:00]  All right.  Hey, wait a minute.  Thank you.  Danny.  That's Mayan Manino.  That's not wheelchair Fred.  All right.  Here we go.  Mark, hold on for one second.  We got Twitchels.  Where's our bets?  Yeah, where's the bets?  Right in front of me.  Right in front of me.  Okay.  We're going to be taking bets with the crowd.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Slap your face.  Slap your face.  Slap your face.  All right.  Hold on. 
[02:04:30]  Slap your face.  Twitchels.  Hey, wait.  We should have a couple of girls sit on his lap.  Yeah.  Twitchels, stand up.  Twitchels, stand up.  This is what's going to happen.  We got like 20 guys.  A couple of girls in here as well.  They all bet $5, Anthony.  Five bucks each.  We're pretty much doing what we did in the studio a few times with Twitchels.  We got like 20 guys.  They all bet $5.  And they wrote down how long they think Twitchels can keep quiet before he has to do his Tourette's  thing.  Okay?  All right.  And Danny, where's all the money? 
[02:05:00]  There you go.  What do we got?  65 bucks.  65 bucks.  The winner will win 65 bucks.  Whoever's closest.  Okay?  All right, you guys.  We should have girls on his lap, though.  We should have a girl sit on his lap.  We'll get shot.  No, after that, we'll do that with the jump thing.  All right.  Get to the front of the stage, you guys.  You guys, you know how this works.  If you listen to the Opie and Anthony show, we're going to try to get everyone at Bill's  Bar as quiet as possible.  Good luck.  I know.  Good luck.  And we need to time this.  Anyone has a timer?  All right.  Steve.  Steve's got the timer. 
[02:05:30]  Steve.  Martini Steve will be the timekeeper for this.  All right.  Give Steve a mic.  Steve, you tell Twitchels when to go here.  All right.  Here we go, guys.  All right.  Here we go.  I just want to say thank you, Boston, for having me.  Oh, shut up.  You fucking prickly.  All right.  Hold on.  Here we go.  You're not being welcomed with open arms, you ass. 
[02:06:00]  Your affliction is being bet upon.  Exactly.  All right.  No love here.  They give them the key to the hospital.  All right.  Here we go.  Let's give this a shot.  If everyone can be quiet, just for a second.  Oh.  I want to be on fire.  All right.  Twitchels.  Twitchels, you ready?  Ready.  All right.  All right.  Listen to Steve.  As soon as you hear Steve, you've got to be quiet as long as you can.  All right.  Ready?  Set.  And start.  Start.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go. 
[02:06:30]  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  He's trying real hard to keep quiet, Anthony.  I'm making him jump, but he's staying quiet, Anthony.  There he is.  Staying quiet.  He's struggling, man.  He's struggling.  He's struggling.  He's trying. 
[02:07:00]  He's breathing heavy.  Oh, 36 seconds.  It hit at the 36-second mark.  36 seconds.  I believe the closest would be 35, unless there's an exact hit.  Boston Strangler, 35 seconds.  He wins the money.  He wins $65.  $65.  Wow.  You know, the smell of that fucker's underwear is just still... 
[02:07:30]  I knew I would get on the air somehow.  There you go.  Hey, Doug, where are you tonight?  They're all asking for Doug OutDug.  All right, Doug OutDug is on PalTalk.  Doug is on PalTalk, allegedly banning people he just doesn't like.  That's what I'm hearing.  All right.  Boston Strangler, thank you.  $65, Richard.  Bullshit!  Bullshit!  Bullshit!  I guess we have some sore looters that lose it in the crowd. 
[02:08:00]  Jesus.  All right.  And it turns into a Yankees sucker.  I don't know how we're going to get this done, but we got three very hot ladies from  Barstool Sports.  Twitch, let's get off the stage.  Your time is done.  Get off the stage.  Look at his asses already twitched with water in his head.  What the hell do we have here?  What the fuck is the...  What?  I think they're girls, Opie.  Girls.  We got girls. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, she needs a microphone to talk to this round.  In her mouth.  Ow!  Look at that fucking card cutter.  All right.  Jimmy said he appreciates your derriere.  Show your kids!  Show your kids!  Show your kids!  Show your kids!  Show your kids, you geese.  Show your kids!  You geese.  Show your kids!  Show your kids!  The girls are going to be going to show their kids, which means they're not going to. 
[02:09:00]  No one's showing their kids.  This is going to be a disappointment.  All right.  This is a disappointment.  Another bust.  Well, let's see.  Ladies.  Ladies.  Fucking disappointment.  Does that work?  The mic?  I don't think it's working.  Show your kids!  There we go.  Now it's working.  Show your kids.  Now, girls, what do you do?  Like, well, you got to talk into the mic.  I can't hear you.  What do you do?  What do you guys do?  We bartend and remodel for Barstool Sports.  Now, what does that entail? 
[02:09:30]  Like, what does that mean?  What do you do?  You've never seen a Barstool Sports report?  No.  What is that?  What is it?  Yuck.

Let's go babble if they're getting anyone's listening to them.  Hey, would you show your heinies to the crowd?  Would you show your turd cutters?  Eat her box.  Not like that.  Obie, is that an eat her box chant I hear?  We haven't heard that since 1965.  Back in the...  An eat her box.  All right, so...  It's not a party until you get an eat her box chant.

Jimmy, you got a question?  Uh, I just want to know what this is.  Turn the mic up, though.  Worthless hoes!  Worthless hoes!  Now, gentlemen...  Hey, you guys!  Steve from Yellowstone wants to ask a question.  Listen, if you want us to show you our tits,  you're going to have to listen to us first.  Yeah.  I mean, listen to me.

All right, look.  I don't normally get upset with a crowd,  but if these ladies aren't allowed to talk,  I'm going to get pissed off.  Yeah.  Now, shut up and let the girls speak.  All right, ladies.  Ladies.  Hey, what exactly?  Oh, wow. 
[02:13:30]  See, ladies, that's how it's done.  That's how it's done.  Sarah from Nice Pace.  Lovely.  That's how it's done.  Hey!  That wasn't a lady from Barstool Sports.  Let her...  All right, guys.  I want one girl from Barstool Sports  to just let us know what it's all about.  Just let that and exactly tell what it is you do.  Because I have no idea still.  I'm trying to figure out what this is all about.  All right.  Now, please, be good.  Be good.  What exactly is it you do?  Barstool Sports.  Ram, Ram!  Get these cock-teasers off the stage. 
[02:14:00]  You guys be good.  Oh, he's there.  So it's a magazine?  Is it a magazine?  Bible Forge is a magazine.  Ram, Ram!  That magazine sucks black dick.  Basically, it talks about your two favorite things.  Barstool Sports and fucking hot chicks. 
[02:14:30]  So, you better...  Ram, Ram!  Hot girls that don't show their tits are useless.  Oh, yeah.  All right, wait a minute.  Oh, yeah.  The girls have been teased enough.  Oh, they're only teased enough.  Oh, yeah.  You want to see a crowd won over in a second.

This crowd would love you.  They would love you.  Allie, come on.  Show us your tits.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Now we got our fans. 
[02:15:30]  The female fans are coming up and showing the girls at Barstool.  Yeah.  I love when it gets to this.  Beat it.  My God.  Steve from Yellowstone was a little abrasive.  Well, what the fuck?  They just sit there and chit-chat.  No one cares.  Show you tits or hit the bricks.  They were nice girls, James.  But they weren't up here for their IQs.  We got five minutes left in this fine radio program.  Ain't there any more librarians that want to come up? 
[02:16:00]  Well, we had a lot of fun here in Boston today.  We had a lot of guests that we were...  Yeah, a lot of them must have got stuck in traffic.  Well, it was good to hear from the return of Psycho Mark.  Yes.  Psycho Mark and...  Buck Cherry.  Anything else to add?  Another typical Boston whores that won't show their tits.  Boring!  Ladies, please.  He is not a reflection.  She wants to say something. 
[02:16:30]  He is not a reflection.  She wants a mic.  She wants a mic.  Get her on mic.  Oh, now she wants a mic.  Psycho Mark is not a reflection of us on this show.  First of all...  Ramone!

Just fuck Jimmy.  She was giving Jimmy the business.  She was giving me the business.  I saw that.  And then she got a mic and then she didn't say anything further. 
[02:17:30]  I think the girls were fabulous.  They were.  Oh my God.  Psycho Mark.  No.  I could.  Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark's ready to cut girls' hair off.  Yeah!  Come on, Timmy.  Let's go take them to a dumpster.  Barstool scores.  Dump them off in half a nanny.  You remember what happened to that girl around the corner?  All right.  Well, we had a lot of fun here, Bill's Barstool.  My God.  What a day.  It's not stopping here, folks.  We're going to continue the party.

Let's ask Ben all the guests that were supposed to be on the show.  Who are we supposed to have today?  That didn't come.  That didn't come.  Dane Menino.  Dane Cook.  Dane wasn't scheduled.  Dane Cook was possibly supposed to show up.  Lily Clark was supposed to show up, right?  Yeah.  Ben, you got to find the phone.  Spaulding.  Ben.  All right.  Spaulding.  Ben, you can't even speak?  Are you that intoxicated?

Spaulding didn't even show up this year.  Spaulding didn't even show up.  We were blown off by fucking Spaulding?  Yes, you were.  All right.  Well.  I seriously think, really, the last words should go to the girls from Barstool.  Come on, man.  Give her a mic.  Come on, guys.  Let's just be fair here. 
[02:19:30]  Be fair to the girls.  Ladies, what's it all about?  They won't learn.  What's it all about?  What's it all about?  Give a plug.  With me.  You guys are fucking drunk.  Ramon, shut this bitch up.  Fucking drunks.  Bunch of fucking drunks, right?  Bunch of fucking drunks, yes.  Bunch of fucking drunks, yeah.  I know, but we love them.  We absolutely love them.  You guys are fucking pussies.  Yeah, that's going to win the crowd over.  Yeah.  Yeah, that'll help.

We'll all know them as victims tomorrow.  You guys want to see all of us half naked in bikini?  Do you want to see us all naked?  Boo!  Mark it away.  Program complete.  Johnny.  Yes.  Good evening.  Yeah.  Well updated.  OK.  I'm not back to the man. 
[02:20:30]  You're right.  Yeah.  Once, I know.  I'll be able to see you.  About time to say goodbye.  To today.  We'll be playing behind.  You're right.  I can't believe in.  Fucking hell and bye.  I can't believe in.  Maybe I can.  By thinking they're ready.  Half of them are okay.  Like a cake.  You're right.  I can have a fucking leaf.  Half of them are fresh.  Bye.  einem blast.  I feel free.  And get back to the Jeremiah. </pre>
