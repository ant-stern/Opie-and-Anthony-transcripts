<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with Jimmy Norton recounting a disastrous paid massage experience with a significantly older woman he described in graphic and disparaging terms.  This led to a discussion, filled with sexually explicit commentary, about the woman's age and appearance.  The conversation then shifted to a news story about a 57-year-old woman expecting twins via IVF, sparking debate about the appropriateness of older motherhood.  Listener calls followed, focusing on disruptive movie-going experiences, frequently employing offensive language and racial stereotypes.  The segment concluded with a discussion about a dominatrix involved in a lawsuit with her nanny, with Norton sharing a vague anecdote about a past encounter with her. This section was also characterized by sexually explicit and offensive humor.

The show continued with a focus on sexual fetishes. One host described a sexual encounter involving a woman urinating in her panties, which he later wore and used for oral sex.  Multiple callers shared their own fetishes, including smelling dirty underwear, attraction to pregnant women, and various BDSM practices.  The callers and hosts engaged in graphic descriptions of sexual acts and preferences, referencing movies like *Monster's Ball*, *Brown Bunny*, and *Kids*.  The discussion briefly veered to a news report about the mother of an astronaut reacting to space shuttle damage, before returning to sexually explicit calls, including a detailed account of a woman's encounter with her UPS delivery man involving BDSM roleplay.

Next, the show pivoted to Anthony's germaphobia, triggered by an intern's clumsy handling of a knife. Opie then shared a humorous, detailed story about his visits to Barry Williams' (Greg Brady) house, speculating on Williams' impending divorce. Listener calls followed, interspersed with a song parody about a frequent caller known for flamboyant clothing, Steve. Opie also recounted a disappointing date arranged through a CB radio.

A significant portion of the show was devoted to an eggnog drinking contest.  The contest, featuring ten in-studio contestants and five remote guessers, was preceded by discussion of Martini Steve, his flame-adorned clothing, and his music parody.  The hosts described the eggnog in detail, comparing its texture to various unpleasant substances. The contest itself was extensively documented, focusing on contestants vomiting, the eggnog's changing consistency, and the hosts' humorous commentary.  Contestants were identified and details of their progress were provided.  Jimmy Norton suffered a minor injury by hitting his head on a window.  Many contestants hailed from Long Island and New Jersey.  The contest, characterized by copious amounts of vomiting and detailed descriptions of bodily functions, culminated in Pat's victory, after consuming over 70 double shots of eggnog.  Martini Steve attempted to calculate the caloric intake of the winner.  Dice, John, and Pat were highlighted as making it to the final rounds. The show concluded with Pat's win, a studio reeking of vomit and eggnog, and a discussion of Pat's caloric consumption.

[00:02:00]  THE END 
[00:02:30]  WHICH IS THE WORST 
[00:03:00]  THE ABSOLUTE WORST  AND YOU'RE LISTENING TO THE WORST OF OPIE AND ANTHONY  THE WORST OF OPIE AND ANTHONY  IT'S ABSOLUTELY AWFUL  Rob checking in from Florida on the instant feedback Anthony says, dude, the Tara Reade's boo picture is up already on opieandanthony.com. 
[00:03:30]  Hey, there we go. Maybe I should look at opieandanthony.com more often.  Now, suffice to say, if I was to pay for it, it would have to be a young, hot chick.  You know?  Oh, a little discussion we were having during commercial.  Yeah, Norton saves his best stuff when we go to break.  And then I have to look at him like, why aren't you talking about this on the air?  He went to Sacramento. He's a successful touring comic when he's not doing the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:04:00]  He pretty much goes somewhere every weekend.  He was in Sacramento and he had three sold-out shows.  The fourth show was pretty much sold out as well.  And all the fans were there and everyone saying he killed.  And then he went back to Adam and Ariel's house.  The couple that is in the lead as Sexiest State in America.  Which, there is a controversy on that, but we'll get to that in a second.  And he went back to their apartment just to meet their creepy friend Ed.  I mean, these people think you're a rock star when you're not on stage, bro. 
[00:04:30]  They know I'm an ass.  And then, what did you get? You got a massage?  Last night before I flew home.  Now, this is a prime example of somebody who does this so much.  Who pays for women's company so much that it's nothing special anymore.  It's nothing you look forward to like somebody who never does it.  And would really go through the shopping process and make sure you're paying for the best thing you could possibly get.  Like, I've never paid for it.  I couldn't bring myself to do it. 
[00:05:00]  It's something I just...  Why are you looking at us in shock?  I know, how weird.  I almost...  I, in recent history, have stopped girls from giving me Hummers.  Because I had one I wanted to pay for later that night.  I'd rather pay for it.  Isn't that odd?  Why would you rather pay for it?  I don't know.  It's just the way he is.  It's part of the dirty factor?  I don't know, man.  Is he feeling extra naughty?  Probably.  I just like the idea of it.  Like, here's the cash.  You know, there's just something about that exchange.  That is saying something about yourself. 
[00:05:30]  Like groupie or something, let's say?  No, no, I'm not an idiot.  I mean, I'm not going to blow off a nine just to pick up a seven or a six for money.  I'll tell you what it is.  I'll do a little psychoanalysis here.  Jimmy is so self-hating that he feels he has to pay for it.  Like, he's not worthy and he has to pay for it.  He shouldn't be getting it for free.  Right.  Like, the girl has to get some type of compensation for doing stuff to him.  You know, because I hate my fat tits.  So, whenever I'm paying for it, I don't care that they're dangling.  Right. 
[00:06:00]  I'm like, I'd play out my nipples.  Now, he'd be self-conscious if the girl's doing this for free.  He's a little more self-conscious about what's going on.  If he's paying, it's like, screw you, bitch.  I'm paying you.  That's why you're here with me.  Yeah, exactly.  We all know this is honest.  It's going to be awful for you.  Just play with my nipples.  We'll both dissociate and get through it.  So, now, if I was paying for it, it would be, I would shop around to find the best, hottest chick for the money I was paying.  But sometimes it's, you know, Jim and I have discussed this.  Sometimes it's not about the hotness of a chick. 
[00:06:30]  What is it about?  Sometimes the slobs, you know, try a little harder, give you a little extra, and that's kind of a turn-on, too.  Well, Jimmy, what did you have?  Well, I was in Sacramento.  I said, you know what?  I'm flying home in a couple hours.  Why not get a massage?  Relax myself a little bit.  Relax a little.  That's good on the air.  Coughing.  But it's not about the massage.  Well, no.  It's about the end of the massage.  Right.  And this girl was $100, and I went to her online.  Girl.  Stop saying girl.  All right.  This 49-year-old.  49-year-old woman he's paying for.  And how did you know she was 49? 
[00:07:00]  Well, I looked at her online.  She looked good.  And there was a picture of her hiney up in the air, and the thong was barely covering.  You know, so she looked like she really had, like, a nice little hot dog pack down there, which I like.  A nice big lip.  So I'm like, all right, this is the girl for me.  She comes over.  She gets lost.  She comes in and has that old lady reek of cigarettes.  You know that old lady cigarette smell?  Yeah.  It's in their hair.  She looked good in the picture.  What was a brand new AMC pacer behind her? 
[00:07:30]  Her fingernails were all yellow from all the smoke, and she does.  Oh, dude.  She had on, like, brown.  What do you want, honey?  She had slacks on.  They were, like, mom slacks.  Slacks.  Brown mom slacks.  And she had a bunt, and her breasts were kind of, like, awful.  I'm 50 years old.  I'm 50 years old.  Don't I look good?  I'm 50 years old.  100 bucks.  I'm like, all right.  100 bucks.  So I lay down on my stomach, and she starts giving me the massage, and she strips down to the thong. 
[00:08:00]  But it didn't, here's what, like, you ever see somebody with a bunt put a thong on?  They pull the thong up high.  You know, so the thong comes all the way up to almost their belly button, and it's covering their bunt.  Oh, no.  That is horrible, man.  And she had a dark tattoo of a flower right by her crotch, but it was, like, almost like an old sailor tattoo.  It was, like, an old guy, his arm is all, like, black and blue-ed, it looks like.  Ozzy's knuckle color, like the Ozzy on his knuckle, like that type of color. 
[00:08:30]  It's lost any brightness to it whatsoever.  It was awful, and I'm looking at it, and I can kind of see the lips.  I'm like, I'm getting turned on.  And she's like, yeah, not bad for a grandmother.  And I was like, oh, no way.  Where to God?  Not bad for a grandmother.  How did you know she was 49?  She told me.  No, that means she's older than 49.  Who are you kidding?  You know what?  You're probably right.  You're probably right.  I mean, you've got to add a minimum of five years onto that.  She's probably 53, 54 years old.  She probably was, yeah, 53, 54.  It was 100 bucks. 
[00:09:00]  Wow.  Especially if she says 49.  That is really, really heinous.  Well, she was massaging me, and I don't know why.  She's like, do you want to massage me?  And her ass looked like two lima beans.  It was long and flat.  Oh.  But I kept, I massaged it anyway, and I was trying to, like, peek between the legs.  And then, uh.  Why?  I don't know.  See, now I'm with Anthony.  Now, at this point, I'm out.  I had to get on a plane.  I had a full rod, and I'm like, I was trying to get her to, you know, drink from the mule.  And, uh, she's like, oh, I don't know.  Did you hug her after she got out of the bathtub and then run out of the room? 
[00:09:30]  Dude, that's exactly, I wrote about her, and that's exactly who I referenced.  Did she claw at Danny's sweater?  Danny.  Oh.  Danny.  That is exactly what she reminded me of.  Danny, who did he?  I think we better take Danny to a doctor.  When do you think maybe we should take Danny to an escort?  Oh, that's horrible.  Awful.  Oh, lima bean ass. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, that's brutal.  She was topless, too, you said?  Well, she told me, I was playing with my nipples, I'm like, I just like, like, sometimes  when a girl's rubbing me, I'll lay on my back, and like a praying mantis, I just diddle  my nipples, and it's just completely disconnected from any human contact while she does what  she does to my mule.  And, um, she's like, my nipples are sensitive, too, and she pops them out, and they were like,  ugh.  Oh, man.  They were brutal.  Yeah, dragging on the ground all day, they would be sensitive.  Little Pinocchio noses.  But I did toy with them, and she's like, I like both, she wanted me to toy with them with both 
[00:10:30]  hands, because I think she just didn't want me touching other body parts, which I wouldn't  have anyway.  Oh, I almost forgot the best part.  So I'm playing with her nipples, but meanwhile, I want to play with mine.  So I try to, like, you know, pull her thong aside, and she's like, well, I don't know,  I have a tampon in.  So I pull it aside.  Oh, my God.  I swear to God.  She did not.  She's been through menopause.  She pulled it aside, there was a string, I just wanted to see the lips, and there was a  string.  It was awful.  It was disgusting. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, she gave a pretty good Hummer, though.  She gave a pretty good Hummer.  Of course.  She's had a lot of practice, many years.  Yeah.  I forgot the tamp.  Oh, my God.  She uses the old 60s technique that she learned, I'm sure.  The old hippie bitch technique.  So did she whack you off?  Yeah, well, she drank it.  Her arthritic hand.  She drank it, huh?  Well, she didn't drink it, but I mean, she, you know, she was, uh...  It's good for my osteoporosis.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  You're saying all the right things there, honey.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[00:11:30]  How you doing tonight, darling?  Oh, you thought you were going to get action from Ariel, one half of the sexiest couple  in America, and you end up with a grandma.  I thought at least I get to watch Ariel.  Nice weekend.  Ugh, I stink.  Oh, oh.  That's my life, dude.  That's what my life is.  I hang out with the hot chick, and then the guy, I'm like, all right, cool, man.  I get to watch him bang, and I wind up with a grandmother with a tampon.  She's wearing a locket with her grandkids' pictures in it.  Or one of those old lady bracelets that has the little grandchild heads around it.  Grandchildren little trinkets around it. 
[00:12:00]  The charm bracelet.  Yeah, charm bracelet.  Then she just took her money and left.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She had a candle she brought with her.  And, uh...  My youngest just got out of college.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Dude, that's awful.  That is a really awful story, and you paid for it.  How much total?  Usually I enjoy your stories, but...  190?  190?  Well, 100, because it was late.  She had a driver, so it was 120, and I tipped her 70 for the Hummer.  I probably could have gotten...  The driver was probably one of our grandkids.  Ugh.  That is despicable.  She had a driver? 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, they always do it.  For safety.  Yeah, safety.  Drive.  I'd fall and break her hip.  Driving Miss Daisy.  All of a sudden, I'm banging her, and I inadvertently hit her life call, and the ambulance came.  Yeah.  It was amazing.  Driving Miss Daisy.  Yeah, driving Miss Daisy.  I'm just trying to drive you to Jim Naughton.  That is really heinous.  It was bad.  Is that the oldest broad you've been with?  How old is the oldest gal you've been with, Jimmy?  In that...  Probably in that area.  I don't mesh with older women.  I don't...  Obviously you don't. 
[00:13:00]  Well, I mean...  Aside from very recently.  Very rarely.  Very rarely.  She was 20 years older than you.  I don't have that fetish at all.  I don't have that fetish.  It's not only not a fetish.  It is something to repulse you.  I'll agree.  You can not have a fetish to something, but still, you know, if it comes your way, take it.  Yeah.  That is somewhere I dare not venture.  I assume, you know, God willing and the river don't rise, there'll be plenty of time to bang old broads.  Yeah.  You know?  She was awful. 
[00:13:30]  You do it now, it's...  I don't see any...  I paid for it.  I don't see anything sexy about that.  I don't either.  It was awful.  That is a horrific story out of The Shining.  I just started hugging her and she looked really good.  And then I just pulled back and when she started laughing, I looked at her back.  Oh, hot.  Speaking of old broads, there's a 57-year-old lady in the paper that's going to have twins, Anthony.  How about...  How do they make this one work? 
[00:14:00]  I mean, is it a natural child thing happening here?  It's probably the drugs.  They give them all kinds of drugs.  Let me see this.  Because these selfish whores want to be mothers.  Yep.  This selfish whore.  I always knew I wanted children.  A 57-year-old career gal is now ready to start a family.  Career gal.  That's it right there, by the way.  Face it.  You have reached the second plateau.  It's over.  Now it's just selfish.  Alita St. James is expecting the best gift of her life for her 57th birthday this week. 
[00:14:30]  Newborn twins.  St. James, a motivational speaker, and the eldest sister of guardian angel leader Curtis Lewa.  Did you read that?  I didn't know that.  She's the sister?  Yeah, it's set to shatter conventional limitations of childbirth tomorrow when she is slated to  deliver a baby boy and girl at Mount Sinai Hospital just three days shy of her birthday.  Oh, that kid's been in a womb that's probably like leather.  All dried up like a saddle.  Like saddle leather.  She conceived through in vitro fertilization, and she will become the oldest American woman 
[00:15:00]  to give birth to twins.  What an...  Oh.  You want your career?  Have your career.  You want a career?  Have a career.  You want to be a mom?  Be a mom.  Make a decision.  Do you know how awful it's going to be for that kid?  What's she, 57?  57.  Picture 13 years old.  You've got to take your mom to the PTA or the parent-teacher conference, and a 70-year-old  mother comes in the door.  70.  If you're still alive at all.  Your kid's 13. 
[00:15:30]  You're 70.  You know the other kids are going to be making fun of you, and it's going to crush the poor  little kid.  Here comes old grandma, old droopy-titted mom coming in, and there you are.  There you are, bringing your mom in, probably on a, maybe even a walker.  She'll have a walker coming into school.  And then there's the other hot moms from the other kids.  Your child will be jealous of the hot mom.  Well, yeah, I mean, 57's not that old. 
[00:16:00]  You know, it really isn't.  Yes, it is.  Well, no.  I mean, she's looking at this like, yeah, I'm 57, I can handle this.  But, you know, a quick 10 years go by, and like what Anthony's talking about here, then  it's a whole other game.  I had the hot mom in school.  You were the one with the hot mom?  I was the one with the hot mom, and my mom dressed like a slut.  She had a, she would, I used to like whine and cry for her to be one of the field trip  mothers, you know, the mothers that go along on the field trips?  Because my friends were just, they were flabbergasted.  She would dress like in white knee-high go-go boots, put pigtails in her hair, halter tops 
[00:16:30]  and shorts, and she's on the bus and like, you know.  That's how she was dressed this summer for that party.  Yeah, of course, she does that.  For your sister.  65 years old or whatever she is.  She's still doing that.  I met her once.  Aunt's mom is still high.  Very solid.  She's a gym rat.  Your mom is smoking, man.  She's an animal.  But back, sorry.  Back then, when she was, you know, she was in her mid-twenties, I guess, or mid to late 
[00:17:00]  twenties.  You had a young mom growing up, right?  And she was the hot, you know, she was hot.  I had the hot mom.  And it was cool because, you know, all my friends and stuff would be like, oh, your mom  is so pretty and everything.  And it was kind of, you know, something to be proud of.  And this woman is going to be the laughing stock.  She's going to make her kid the laughing stock.  You know how embarrassing it is?  I knew kids that had like really old parents.  It's embarrassing for the kid.  She can't do anything.  Go to a parent student, like, outing. 
[00:17:30]  One of those things.  She's going to be sitting there nodding off with oxygen and a walker.  Bedpan under her.  Ugh.  She'll be 75 when her kids graduate high school.  It's selfish.  75.  Look at Tony Randall, that old bastard.  Had those kids and then drops dead.  And all those people were applauding like, oh, good for you.  That's great, Tony.  Good for you.  You know, he wants to be a dad to a little kid.  And those kids are now, what, five, six years old and they don't understand why daddy's  dead already?  We'll never know the father. 
[00:18:00]  What a selfish, selfish thing to do.  Eef.  All right.  You should adopt a kid, at least.  Yeah, adopt some mongoloid.  Yeah, take in a little black boy or something and touch its smooth skin.  Well, she says something about the adoption thing here.  Oh, she does.  The reason that I wanted to carry these children rather than adopting them is that I knew that  I could give them, while they were in the uterus, a tremendous amount of love, a tremendous  amount of support.  I wanted to give them that start. 
[00:18:30]  Oh.  I don't think of myself with a number.  I don't think, oh, I'm going to be 60.  I think I'm going to take these kids to school, she added.  Yeah.  Sure.  You probably got to sew the thing up like one of those turkeys after you put the stuffing  just to hold the kid in for term.  I'm ready.  Ready to fall out with her uterus.  I'm ready, she said, with great determination, resting her swollen frame against the living  room wall.  Oh, man.  You kind of like that, though, don't you?  Because you like pregnant and you like him older, too. 
[00:19:00]  No, I hope he digs the older.  Oh, he does.  He's a weirdo.  He's a weirdo.  I like to eat.  I have an older woman fetish, but that was when I was younger.  Now that's a problem.  I got to get rid of that fetish because, well, you know, we're getting up there now.  So now for that fetish to happen, I got to be into, like, I don't know, 50-year-olds.  Never liked older women.  I'm talking when I was, like, 18, 19, 20, and I saw the mothers in their, like, early  30s.  That was a major turn-on, even as high as 40.  Yeah.  Well, I got to get rid of that fetish, obviously. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, let's see.  Birth canal looks like the Indiana Jones ride at Disney.  Kid'll come toppling out of there, big boulder chasing him.  Hey, Bill, what's up?  Bill, you still there?  Hey.  Yeah.  All right, let's go.  Hello, Bill.  I teach kindergarten in a Philly suburb.  Philly?  How about those eagles?  How about those eagles?  Yeah, well.  Whatever.  Go ahead.  We got old bags coming through that like you wouldn't believe, man.  In kindergarten, huh?  I had a mom last year.  She retired while her kid was in kindergarten, and she still had a three-year-old. 
[00:20:00]  But what they do is they do their careers, and they get a bunch of money, and then they  get a nanny to come and take care of the kid.  And they take the kid out for a little while for, like, a walk or something.  Well, you know, it's definitely the new thing.  People are having kids a lot later in life.  It's the drugs.  They're able to do that in vitro.  They're able to give them drugs, and they can have these kids out of their selfish,  for these selfish reasons.  Well, that's the problem.  That's why this 57-year-old bag is having twins. 
[00:20:30]  I've seen old bags with triplets.  And, man, they don't have the energy to take care of those kids.  Of course they don't.  They don't have the energy to take care of them or to do what's necessary to, like,  raise a healthy kid.  Oh.  You want to be able to interact with your child, not be a mess sitting there in a chair  because you can't go out there.  What a selfish thing to do.  Well, a lot of these women have this thing where it's so hip, and they think that any  woman that wants to be a mother is, like, a cornball or submissive to men.  She's like, oh, I want my career.  I'm not going to be a slave like that. 
[00:21:00]  And then they realize that they're unfulfilled whores by the time they're 60.  And they're like, gee, maybe being a mom wasn't such a degrading, awful thing.  Let me try doing that now.  Yeah, let me take a whack at it now at 60.  Yeah, that's it.  Because their career left them unfulfilled.  Yeah.  What, your two cars in the garage didn't quite bring you the satisfaction you thought it would?  Your self-centered pigs?  I ran out of air.  I saw that.  I completely identify with that problem, Jim North.  Oh, I knew I was running out of air quick with that one.  I want to announce I'm going to be a father. 
[00:21:30]  Your face turned red and everything.  I can't believe it.  I just ate four burritos and drank a pot of coffee.  Anyone for trouser chilling?  Oh, God damn.  Oh, God.  He will be an enemy show.  Oh, God.  Hello, MyRadioStore.com.  Yo, my bro got me XM yesterday, but it went off because it was stolen.  So I really need to get one for myself.

But the movie going experience, I wish everybody handled the movies like me.  Hey, I go in with the only reason I have to go to the movies is to see the goddamn movie.  I don't talk.  I sit there.  I watch the movie.  I don't answer cell phones.  I don't do anything. 
[00:24:30]  What is the problem with people that they don't, that they have to be doing other things  and ruining the movie going experience?  Because there's so many people out there that they go with someone else to the movie  that they feel like they have to acknowledge their presence in the theater.  I don't go alone.  Huh?  I don't go alone.  I know, but you're like a normal person.  But there's a lot of people out there just because they are going to the movie with their  friend or boyfriend, girlfriend, what have you.  Yeah.  They have to acknowledge them throughout the whole movie.  Like, oh, my God.  You see?  Oh, wow.  You see that? 
[00:25:00]  So I was saying, well, at the office the other day.  Right, right, right.  No, what?  You're at the movie.  Shut up.  Shut up now.  They got to yap.  Go talk about the movie at Starbucks after the film's over.  There you go.  The answer to your question, why do people yap at the movies?  They actually need to do a study.  The answer, melanin.  There certainly is a disproportionate number of black people that like to talk at the movie  as opposed to whitey.  I wouldn't know because I go to the white movie theater. 
[00:25:30]  Well, I do now too, Opie.  But as you know, I used to live in Brooklyn.  You search out the white movie theaters.  I had to go to the black movies.  And it is a little frightening.  And unfortunately, it's not like you can turn around and say, hey, shh, please, I'm trying  to watch the movie.  Because you'll probably get shanked in the throat.  Or punched and then wake up in a hospital with Christmas music.  The latest Christmas movies will be out.  Right.  You can catch. 
[00:26:00]  Excuse me, sir.  I'm trying to watch the movie.  Bam!  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  What happened?  I was...  Okay, I remember.  I was watching Star Wars.  I heard a cell phone go off.  It was late May.  It was like, yeah, late May.  Why is there a Christmas tree in my room?  And now...  And this isn't my room.  It's 4.30 in the afternoon.  It's dark out.  I see Christmas lights.  And there's presents around me. 
[00:26:30]  Excuse me, sir.  We're trying to...  Bam!  Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock.  Jingle...  What?  What happened?  You used to go to the Comac movie theater, right?  Yep.  Until there were so many shootings that we got the hint.  And Whitey realized, okay, this movie theater isn't for us.  More action in the lobby than on the screen.  They had so many people shooting at the screen, shooting each other online. 
[00:27:00]  Stabbings, too.  Stabbings.  It was a place where the gangs would just hang out as you, as a law-abiding citizen,  wanted to see a lousy movie.  Latin Kings from Brentwood would come in.  Very scary.  To get you through the weekend.  All you want to do is watch a dumb movie.  And you couldn't even enjoy that because you were worried that you were going to get shot or something.  That's all.  Just trying to see a movie.  And you've got to worry about getting in a fight.  And it doesn't matter.  I have the worst goddamn luck in movie theaters.  I will get there a little early.  I'll search out a good spot. 
[00:27:30]  Okay?  Because I don't want to have to deal with climbing over people.  I don't want to sit in a seat that's too far away or too close.  Because then it's always on my mind.  I'm like, goddammit, I'm too far.  Or I'm too close.  So I get there a little early.  I pick out a good seat.  Mm-hmm.  And it never fails that right before the movie starts, a gaggle of criminals comes in and sits right around me.  Right around me.  And then I'm tense the whole movie going, oh, I'm going to be killed because they're not going to shut up. 
[00:28:00]  And I'm going to get pissed.  And I'm going to throw something.  And there's going to be a fight.  It never fails.  I'll sit there and go, I think we made it.  I think we made it.  The movie's starting.  The lights are dimming.  And there's no one around us that could possibly, yeah, I think this seat here good.  It's the last.  Oh, no.  It's always the last minute traffic.  It is.  Because I'm the same way.  Ah, no one in front of me.  This is awesome.  The previews are just about over.  Mm-hmm.  And here comes the movie.  And all of a sudden, last second, they always sit right in front. 
[00:28:30]  Here they come, right in front.  And they're punching each other and laughing and trying to smoke or drink or do something in there.  Answer their cell phones.  Yeah, all their cell phones are going off like crazy.  You know how you do that thing, a kid running by screaming?  Yeah.  You ever been to a movie theater where, like, they decide that the movie is good enough for a babysitter, I guess?  Yeah.  They bring their kids to the movie theater, and their kids will run up and down the aisle?  Yeah.  Have you been in one of these?  Ah, ah, ah, ah. 
[00:29:00]  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Up and down the aisle, and you're looking at why aren't they containing this animal?  Why?  Because it is.  It's a babysitter now.  They're on the cell phone in the corner somewhere conducting business that they can't conduct  when their kid is around the house yelling.  And their kid now can just run around in the movie theater.  Yeah.  Because who cares?  It's their babysitter.  It just cost them a couple of bucks to get in there. 
[00:29:30]  And I'm just trying to watch the goddamn movie.  Let's go to John and Comac.  John, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Comac, home of the Comac Motor Inn and the Comac Movie Theater.  Yeah, good times back in high school, man.  Good times.  Good times.  Yeah, my first date ever.  I took these couple of girls, me and my buddy, took these girls to the movie theater,  and we had a gun pulled on us.  Oh.  Why would you have a gun pulled on you?  Were you being robbed? 
[00:30:00]  Did you speak up?  What happened?  No, we were a bunch of Comac kids.  You know, we were wearing little pieces of gold, walking in there like we owned the place,  and a couple of kids of Brentwood do it otherwise.  Brentwood.  That is a dangerous area these days.  Yeah, good thing my friend's mommy was outside, so we pulled ass to her car.  My friend's mommy.  The station wagon pulled up and let you kids off?  Yeah.  And you guys think you're badasses?  Yeah.  All badasses from Comac.  Which is fine, Gold.  Go, go, go. 
[00:30:30]  With your very thin bling on, thinking you're all that.  And then the Brentwood Hispanics come in, and it's over, Johnny.  My friend with his bar mitzvah gold on, thinking me and shit.  His bar mitzvah gold.  All the people are wearing license plates.  I went one time to, I figure a movie was with my buddies from work, there were all these  hardcore black guys, we worked in a warehouse together, and I didn't realize that there  was a one seat rule when you sit next to another guy, and it was an empty theater.  So we all walk in and sit down, and I sit right next to my friend Malcolm, and he goes, 
[00:31:00]  what the fuck are you doing, man?  We're not dating.  Move over.  Leave an empty seat for a man.  Suburban idiot.  Thanks to another man.  No surprise here.  Let's go to James in Comac.  James.  What's up, boys?  What's up?  Hey, man.  Two quick stories for you.  First one was, and I never go to the Comac movie theater anymore because it is just run  by criminals, but I ran into a pimp walking out one time.  Not a guy who looked like a pimp, or, you know, the full getup.  The loud green suit, purple hat with an orange feather, and a gold cane. 
[00:31:30]  Huggy bear.  Yeah.  And had the whores from Brentwood nearby.  Second story was, and I told him.  Wait, and he was trying to get the girls some dates as people were leaving the movie theater?  There you go.  That's a little business.  Oh, yeah.  What you guys got to understand now, you know, there are towns that just have these theaters,  like these black, whatever you want to call them, these gang theaters or what have you.  Gang theaters.  That's good.  But this Comac multiplex is in a relatively nice area. 
[00:32:00]  Nice area, but it borders with crap.  Yeah, and people come from all over because it was the first real multiplex in our area  on Long Island, and this is the stuff you just didn't expect at first.  No.  Going there.  But slowly but surely, all this has moved in.  The pimps, the drug dealer, and the gangsters.  You know, when you look in the parking lot and just see, like, a ton of old Toyotas with  spoilers on them, that you're in trouble.  And gold-painted hubcaps.  You know there's trouble.  Second story for the guys. 
[00:32:30]  I told this a couple years ago on N.E.W.  Was gone in 60 seconds.  A Latin family comes in right as the movie's starting.  We're there with my friends.  And they're stealing the cars and whatnot, and the Latin boyfriend, baby daddy, whatever  you want to call him, is going, yo, man, I haven't tried that.  I got to fucking try that one.  He's picking up pointers.  Yeah, meanwhile, the grandmother, who looks like she's 25, has the three-year-old kid  rocking back and forth, hitting it to my legs as I'm trying to watch the movie, and baby 
[00:33:00]  daddy's telling me about his methods of stealing cars.  It's a very safe movie theater.  That's classic.  All right, thanks, James.  Yeah, that one time I was at the movie theater in Brooklyn, and I had a Hispanic family in  front of me, and they just went on and on and wouldn't shut up, and it was an entire  row in front of us that was just full of Hispanics, and I'm sitting there going, oh,  jeez, they're not going to shut up, they're not going to shut up, and my girlfriend at 
[00:33:30]  one point just yells out, would you shut the fuck up?  Oh, great.  And I'm like, and that's when the guy turned around and said of his chick that was up  there, said, oh, she's in battle mode.  Now she's in battle mode, and I'm like, battle mode, oh, this is trouble.  This is trouble.  You bring up something that's great that maybe we can get into later.  You know, our chicks, and I'm saying our chicks, I'm talking about all guys out there  to get us in trouble. 
[00:34:00]  You know, that's obviously something your chick should have said, right, Anthony?  Right.  But they're not turning around and going to confront the chick.  No.  They're going to confront you.  No, it's me.  Now you have to defend your honor, her honor.  Because then the woman turns around and goes, how about I smack your face?  I'm like, I just came to see Mission Impossible 2.  I'm trying to see Mission Impossible 2.  And now I'm in a fight for my life with some Hispanic family. 
[00:34:30]  Now it's just going to be a mission to get out of this.  Mission Impossible.  Get out alive.  Exactly.  Honestly, she's throwing young Hispanic children at me.  It's just horrific.  Yeah.  Quick, go for the exit by the screen.  I think our car's parked outside.  Baby, you go for the door.  I'm going to head for the ventilation system.  I think I can get them on my trail and lose them.  Oh, she's in battle mode, is she? 
[00:35:00]  Unbelievable.  It was frightening.  Did you have to change seats?  What I did was probably one of the, you know, the biggest whitey pussy moves ever.  I got up and left the theater.  Just left.  What was I going to do?  Dude, there were, it was a complete row.  One Hispanic family.  Guys, those chicks that'll pull razor blades out and slit your throat.  And screaming children.  It was a whole family that did not give a shit what was going on in this theater. 
[00:35:30]  It was their living room.  It was their roach infested living room at the time.  Anyone in there was an inconvenience to them.  So I went up, you know, I find the, I find the assistant to the assistant manager of the movie theater.  Hey, Red, you're the assistant to the assistant manager.  And I was placed in another theater that was playing Mission Impossible 2. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, that's pretty cool.  That was just starting.  So I got to sit down with other frightened white people that had left that theater, I think.  Because it was just, there was only a few of us.  And we were all white, just sitting there, kind of, I'm a pussy, but at least I'm seeing the movie and I'm alive.  You know, this is not a movie that comes out that I want to see that badly that I'll go on weekends or when the movie theater's crowded.  Yeah.  All these movies, I wait to almost the day it's going to be out of theaters and then I finally see the movie.  And then it's a lot less people and a lot less hassle. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  Every once in a while I do get in a situation because maybe other people want to go or what have you.  And I'm in a, you know, a crowded movie theater.  I have the strangest pet peeve.  Maybe there's other people out there that feel the same way.  But when the previews are done and it gets really quiet for that minute or two as the movie's slowly but surely starting up,  I start hearing everyone eating their popcorn and opening up their candy and drinking their soda.  It goes right through me where I start, like, getting all, I get nuts. 
[00:37:00]  I get nuts.  It's kind of like the same thing that happens when, you know, I hear vacuum cleaners.  Yeah.  It goes right through me.  I don't know what it is.  I mean, when you're in a theater and there's a couple hundred people all eating popcorn at the same time,  it sounds like locusts.  It is the most disturbing sound.  It is our locusts.  Next time, listen closely.  Animals.  As, you know, it gets dark and really quiet in the theater and listen to what's going on around you.  It is amazing.  Everyone.  Yeah.  And the packaging for, you know, all this stuff is just the worst because it's not a quick little rip and you're ready to eat. 
[00:37:30]  It takes forever for these people to open up their shit.  They're all digging in their hands and making noise.  I don't even want to admit this on the air, but it just, it drives me.  It's gotten to the point where I'm with people and they have to tell me, just relax, relax.  It'll be over soon.  Yeah.  And there's been a few times where I want to just walk out.  I can't handle it.  And then I'm just waiting for everyone to finish up with their popcorn and stuff.  And it usually takes a good 20 to 30 minutes.  And then I can finally relax. 
[00:38:00]  Do you eat anything?  If I do, I'm so considerate because I know how bad it is.  You wait until the movie gets loud?  Or either, yeah, or I'll open up my stuff beforehand.  No joke.  Yeah.  I'm eating popcorn like.  Just letting it melt in your mouth.  Basically, yeah.  Soften it up.  Squeeze it between your tongue and palate.  It is one of my worst pet peeves.  Dude, it's like.  That's a little rough.  It's like if you were taking your nails and just right across a chalkboard.  Yeah.  It's the same effect to me.  Wow.  With me. 
[00:38:30]  It just drives me nuts.  And people that go with me, they think I'm out of my mind.  I'm a Twizzlers guy.  See, that's nice and soft.  I don't think that makes much noise.  No.  Popcorn makes a lot of noise.  Oh, it's just like.  Like I said, I'll say it again.  Like locusts just going at it.  Donnie on Long Island.  What's up, Donnie?  Hey, a couple of things.  One is here's worse than guys talking.  These guys are the gangsters talking around you.  And I'm there with my wife.  And my wife turns around and goes, you guys haven't shut up in the entire fucking movie. 
[00:39:00]  And so my wife opens the can of worms with them.  And now I'm the one holding the bag that I have to like defend her and everything.  And I look over and I go, why don't you just shut up?  Let them, you know, let them talk.  Let them do whatever they want.  Yeah, because she turns around and she starts it.  And then I got to get involved, you know?  What did they do besides apologize to her for being loud?  Yeah.  You little bitch.  And the girl starts licking my wife in the head.  And then the other thing is, you ever just wish you were like Charles Bronson at that 
[00:39:30]  moment and just deal with it that way, you know?  It's like, imagine Charles Bronson next to the theater.  Okay, you guys shut the fuck up now.  Pull out a magnum and blow their heads off.  Yeah, that would be nice.  That would be fun.  Unfortunately, yeah.  But then you would go to jail for a long time.  Yeah, you'd go to jail.  And the lawyer fees would be astronomical.  You're a man in jail.  What can you say?  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's go to Mark in Long Island.  Mark, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I went about 10 years ago.  Me and my girlfriend at the time went to go see A Time to Kill. 
[00:40:00]  So we're trying to go.  She lived on the South Shore.  And so we're trying to go to Rockville Center, sold out, trying to go to, you know, Westbury.  Anywhere we could go, it's all sold out.  The only place we can go to the movies is the Green Acres Mall at Valley Stream to see  this movie.  Now, you guys know Green Valley Stream.  So you get in there, and it's just like a crime scene waiting to happen.  And it's all, you have to go through metal detectors to go through there.  Now, in the movie A Time to Kill, there's somebody that's, some white guys rape a little black 
[00:40:30]  girl and whatever.  Everybody in the movie theater thought they were in a courthouse, and they were ready  to lynch, like, all the white people.  And me and my girlfriend are sitting there just like, oh, my God, we are going to die.  It is rough to go to a movie that's racially charged and look around and see it's a very  diverse audience.  People do tend to feel a little uncomfortable, don't they?  I sit there and, oh, this is uncomfortable.  I think it was a bad move.  I went to see Malcolm X in the theater, and there's one scene where the cops are beating  up a black guy before X and the rest of the Muslims go down to protest, and I actually 
[00:41:00]  went, good job, Officer Ho.  That could be some trouble for you there, Jimmy.  Let's go to Paul on Long Island.  Yeah, hi, my wife and I just moved to Ronkonkoma, and we were looking to go see that movie Saw.  Yeah.  And we went to the Comac movie theater, which was a bad idea.  But all the gang kids, and they just keep using their bleep, bleep Nextel cell phones  the whole time.  Oh, yeah.  Talking to them, bleep, bleep, bleep. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, all the time, bleep, bleep, bleep, and they're laughing.  That's why they've got to bring the drinking age back down to 18, I'm telling you right now,  because these kids have nothing to do but hang out at movie theaters.  Go to the movies.  Yeah, I mean, you know, the parents are on to the keg parties at their houses when they're  away on those little weekend jaunts.  Yeah.  So what happens, it was happening in Huntington, you know, every Friday and Saturday night,  the theaters, it didn't matter what movie, were just packed with teenagers, because that's  where they socialize and hang out, and maybe cop a feel during the movie, and they check 
[00:42:00]  their cell phones, and they're text messaging, and they're running, they're getting up 10,  12 times a movie to run out in the hall, to run into another theater, because they heard  this dude is there, or this chick is there.  Yeah.  It's just a whole social thing that has nothing to do with watching the movie.  With actually watching the movie.  Get the drinking age down to 18, so these kids have something to do.  There you go.  Because then that means, you know, you'll be drinking at 15 again.  Yeah.  Like the good old days.  Like the good old days.  Let's say hi to Brian in Virginia. 
[00:42:30]  Brian, what's up?  Hey, I cannot stay, but the last movie I went to because of this kind of crap was Spider-Man,  and we had the most cliche family, everything.  The little kid, the cell phones.  I got so effing tired of it.  I literally pulled out a $20 bill, walked up to him and said, if you just fucking leave,  you can have this $20.  They all stopped, looked at each other, and like they won the lottery.  Okay, great.  That was the best $20 I ever spent.  Never thought of that.  Yeah, right on.  The Brooklyn theaters I went to, they probably robbed me, though.  If he has $20 to give me, he's probably got a lot more on him. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, or do they just take it and go, I ain't going nowhere.  Thanks, and buy popcorn.  Yep.  Or some jujubes or whatever else, young gentleman-like.  Ammunition.  Yeah.  Hey, this is Laszlo from the Technophile at Grand Theft Auto.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony with a wow sticker, some air guitar,  and a roofie.  Shit sucks.  Jimmy, you know this dominatrix in the paper?  Yeah.  Scarlett Constance LeMay or something like that?  I don't know her last name. 
[00:43:30]  I just knew her actually through friends.  Also known as Vampyra, is being sued by an ex-nanny?  I don't know the nanny.  So what?  She whips people during the day, and while she's doing that, she's got a nanny taking  care of her kids at home or something?  I think she has one sign, and there's a nanny, I guess, apparently who takes care of the kid.  She may be a dominatrix, but she claims to be the one feeling the pain.  Oh, I get it.  Daily News is good.  Feeling the pain.  Enough with the jokes in the New York papers. 
[00:44:00]  They're awful.  They're so witty.  Vampyra, when fronting her, she was slapped with a lawsuit by a former nanny who alleged  she was underpaid and abused.  Vampyra denies the charges and says she's the victim of an extortion plot hatched by Brazilian  immigrant, Luzenda Lee Campos, whom she fired last year. 
[00:44:30]  Probably right.  I am the victim here, says the dominatrix.  She is trying to take every penny she can from me.  She's trying to get back in me and ruin my life.  Do you notice that every sex trade person that winds up in the newspapers here, I somehow  know?  Yeah, that's what amazes me.  It's like, Jimmy, you know this woman?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What, you use her services?  Well, I actually knew her through a friend and wound up maybe meeting once for, you know,  maybe.  Wait, what's the deal?  Because I was reading the rest of this. 
[00:45:00]  I met her through a friend in other settings.  I knew her through a buddy.  And maybe we hung out one time and there was Tinkle involved.  Maybe.  I'm not saying there was.  Oh, God.  Can I not speculate as to what may have happened?  You're taking Tinkle from a mother.  She's a mother of a six-year-old son.  How do you feel about yourself?  Thirsty.  So she came over to your pad?  I'm not saying that.  I'm not saying that at all.  I'm just saying that it could have happened in some alternate reality. 
[00:45:30]  I'm getting the heebie-jeebies.  Oh, you.  Don't be a silly goose.  I just don't see that as a fetish.  She's actually a nice girl.  Is she?  Yeah.  She had a little chat before or after.  No, no.  I knew her before through another friend.  I had met her socially just as a person.  Talked to her and all that stuff.  And she's very nice.  And I actually believe her that this stupid Brazilian is probably extorting her.  You know, you have these conversations with a girl like that, right?  And then you invite her over to maybe do something like Tinkle.  Do you think about what might be going on in her head? 
[00:46:00]  No.  Because you had had a conversation.  It wasn't just like she knocks on the door.  Here's two strangers.  Do this.  And she's like.  Like, do you think she might have gone, wow, he seemed like a nice guy when I was talking with him?  And now I'm squatting over him.  No, because I think that anybody who's a dom is comfortable with that and understands it.  They talk to people all the time who would never acknowledge they have that side of them, but they know that people do.  Do you understand what I mean?  It's like judges, cops, lawyers, all these guys. 
[00:46:30]  A lot of repressed married guys go to doms.  I'm not like that.  I'm just open about it.  That's the only difference.  So I don't care who knows it.  Big deal.  If I was married, I'm sure I'd care.  But they talk to people all the time.  I talk to people who appear so normal and nice, but I know.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, but you would like to think she's so used to it and desensitized by it and doesn't really think that.  But she's probably thinking, oh, my God, what a freak.  Well, no.  We didn't actually talk about it when we met socially.  But I think that she's probably into it, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, they don't look at themselves as freaks. 
[00:47:00]  I don't look at myself as a freak.  I mean, a freak is a pedophile or a guy that, you know, bangs animals.  I mean, to me, that's like antisocial to a point.  Whatever you've got to say to get yourself to sleep at night.  Believe me, I will admit an asterisk here.  I've actually had this little dialogue with myself on the pillow as my nose was stuffed from tears flowing down.  You know how you're crying, you get stuffy.  You know, at least you're not touching children.  Yeah, but where's the line, man?  I think everyone has, like, fetishes.  It has to turn me on.  No, I know.  I understand that. 
[00:47:30]  But, I mean, where's the line where your fetish is normal but, you know, the pedophile and the bestiality thing, obviously, is...  Consenting adults.  Well, that's obviously wrong.  But a lot of people would say a dominatrix taking a leak on you is way out there and wrong, too, though.  It is out there.  I'm not going to say it's wrong, but it's certainly out there.  I mean, most fetishes are, like, foot fetish.  I like big-breasted women.  That's the standard.  Sure.  I like a little spanking, you know, that type of thing.  And you're way over to this side. 
[00:48:00]  Well, believe me.  And you're trying to say that's as normal as a foot fetish thing?  No, not as normal.  Foot fetish is much more accepted because it's seen as a cleaner thing.  But, no, it's not normal.  The norm...  The foot fetish thing, I don't get it.  Me neither.  I think it's deeply disturbing.  Yeah.  Someone saw little mommy's tootsies when they were a little boy.  They were playing in the kitchen, and there were mommy's painted toes, and they got confused.  It's a little bump in their undershorts, and it became that nuttiness.  Is that where that comes from?  I believe so, because it's submission.  The foot is a low part of a person. 
[00:48:30]  I mean, even the Bible, Christ washes the feet of the beggar.  Yeah.  You wash that foot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wash all nine of those toes.  Thanks, Lord.  Jesus.  You can knock off a little early.  Nine toes.  You're going to be hanging around?  So, I think...  I don't know where a fetish comes from.  Maybe you get bored.  I get bored a lot of times.  It's very hard to turn on sex.  You get bored, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, bored.  Whew.  Yeah, but I think everyone has a fetish, if you really asked every person.  I don't have a foot fetish, but, like, nasty feet are disgusting. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, I thought you were going to say, but nasty feet turn me on.  No, that's, like, big, nasty, long claw toes and gnarly things.  Ugh.  Like, that's really rank, and that could ruin things, you know.  You don't have any fetishes, though.  Like, you're pretty, like, normal.  Like, you just, like...  I bet you...  I mean, it's not going to, like, share, but I bet you if we talked to him long enough,  he would tell us something.  A fetish?  I think every person has some kind of fetish.  I'll be honest. 
[00:49:30]  I'm trying to think.  A fetish is more of a non-sexual thing that you sexualize, so liking big breasts is not really  a fetish, it can be a preference, but I think, you know, like, you know, tinkle or feet are  non-sexual things that are being sexualized, like, you know what I mean?  Like, that type of, like, wearing panties, which has never been a fetish of mine.  Oh, I did it with one girl I dated once.  One night, I put pants...  Would you?  Would you?  You put on some panties?  Yeah, I'll tell you what happened, and...  Oh, my God.  What she used to do, this is a long time ago... 
[00:50:00]  Wait, can we regroup for a second?  What?  I'm trying to tell you.  You just throw that out like it's no big deal.  It's not.  Would you?  It's not.  Fuck me.  Can I help you with that?  Would you?  Would you?  Would you?  I love that one.  Audio of the girl.  Are you about a size 14?  Jimmy?  No.  I was seeing this one girl, and, you know... 
[00:50:30]  It rubs the lotion on its skin and does whatever it's told.  I was wearing the girl's suit.  Will you go ahead and tell your story?  I, um...  Well, she used to, uh...  It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.  God.  I can't...  I have to hear the next one.  I know.  Put the fucking lotion in the basket.  In the basket.  He's just so exasperated with her.  Her tardiness with the lotion.  Their questions.  Oh, yeah.  Why isn't that lotion in the basket and in my hand right now? 
[00:51:00]  Doesn't want to humanize her.  Put the fucking lotion in the basket.  In the basket.  Keep mentioning her name is Catherine.  That's smart.  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  I was, um, seeing this one girl who I, again, I like, uh, you know, some golden shower.  And, uh, she would tinkle in her panties for me.  Oh.  And, uh, yeah, it was kind of, not a lot, just a dribble, just to wet it.  And, uh, oh, I would...  Wow, that's some control shit. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, yeah, she was a good egg.  And, um, you know, it was kind of hot.  And, uh, so she would do this for me and I'd go down on it.  It was really nasty.  And then one time, she actually liked guys to put on panties because she liked the way  a guy's mule looked in panties.  Uh-huh.  Um, and one time she wet her panties and she asked me if I'd put them on.  I said, yeah, so I did.  And I stood up and she gave me a Hummer through the panties.  Wow.  After she had wet them.  Wow.  One of the dirtiest things.  That is filthy.  I have never had a rod like that.  To see her doing... 
[00:52:00]  Because it did, like, when you put them on, your mule looks monstrous.  Like, you know, the thing that was built just can't contain it.  And the fact that she had done that first in them and then was like...  And she was so turned on doing it.  Because we both realized this is so a step beyond the perversion we had engaged in.  Yeah.  And then, you know, boom, pulled them down to finish me off.  But that was one of the most turned on I've ever been.  But I never did it again.  It just wasn't a thing for me. 
[00:52:30]  It's not a fetish.  I don't feel it's naughty underwear thing.  But at that moment, it was a complete turn on.  Why not?  Dude, it was hot.  She grabbed it after she had wet it and I put them on and she was just all over it.  Wow.  I've never been packing like that in my life.  It must have been some scene.  It was fantastic.  You continue to amaze me.  Why?  That was great.  Just when I thought I've heard every story.  Put the fucking lotion in the basket!  That wasn't that bad.  That's not that bad. 
[00:53:00]  Mmm.  Well...  Silky.  All nice and silky.  Yeah.  They weren't granny underwear, were they?  No, no, no.  They were regular.  They weren't her period panties either.  They were just regular ones.  All right.  Well, that makes it okay, I guess.  Oh, yeah.  They were hot little panties.  Yeah.  Let's go to Josh in Wisconsin.  I blow that relationship.  Josh.  Dope.  Hey, man.  What's going on, guys?  You guys rock.  All right.  What's up, Josh?  Jimmy, dude, I just got to say, man, you killed in Chicago when you were out here, man.  You were awesome.  Oh, thanks for coming, man.  I appreciate it.  Anyway, I'm just calling out.  Yeah, you know, I'm an ass, man.  You know, most guys, they're either a tip man or a leg man. 
[00:53:30]  I'm an ass, man.  And what I used to do with my ex-girlfriend is I'd go in her bathroom and I'd go through  her clothes hamper and I'd just smell all of her dirty underwear.  That's, um, so you like, like, an ass in your face, right?  Not just, like, not just anal sex, but, like, the smell of an ass in your face.  Well, yeah, you know, I like that.  And I just, I like how, you know, a perfectly shaped ass and just things like that, you know.  Oh, yeah.  I believe you, dude.  I completely relate.  Hey, man, we all, we all love it.  Punch it out.  We all love the ass, but the, uh. 
[00:54:00]  It's got to be, there's a smell of an ass.  Let's clear this up here.  It's, that's, that's, that's some touchy, uh, touchy ground there.  There is a fine line.  It can be, if it's rank, it makes me want to retch.  It's gross.  There's nothing worse than an ass that smells like an armpit or one that smells like, uh,  like, yeah, there's some brutal ones.  But, you know, a nice, if it's clean and there's hygiene, it's very sexy.  Yeah.  Uh, let's go to freak show.  Freak show.  Hey, I can't believe Anthony's giving, give Norton a hard time when he's got a thing for pregnant women. 
[00:54:30]  You know, you want to have sex with a baby with a woman with a baby three inches away.  That's true.  No, no, I don't want to have sex with, uh, pregnant women.  I do not.  I, I find it to be a, a turn-on, though, yes.  Wow.  So you're turned on by a woman with a baby with a baby.  Yeah, but I don't want to have sex with some.  Norton just wants somebody to pee on them.  I don't want to have sex with some lady that's carrying some, you know, other dude's baby.  Now, guys, you really are having trouble with phones.  You're fading in and out real bad.  All right.  Well, no, I, I mean, I, I think, uh, pregnant woman is, uh, very sexy, though. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Not a thing for me.  I don't think it's awful, either.  Well, she's got to be hot.  Too.  She can't be a fat mess with pregnant women.  I really don't think about it.  Let's go to Brett.  Hey, Brett.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to say, uh, perversion can actually be viewed as going hand-in-hand with complexity.  Intelligence.  Because if you look at the more advanced societies, like Japan and Germany, and, you know, really  advanced, sophisticated, intelligent people, and you look at the disgusting, fucking depraved 
[00:55:30]  shit that's coming out of those countries, and that's considered normal, and then, by  contrast, you look at something like an African Bushman or just some primitive Peruvian, all  they want is a big, fat chick.  All the guys in Germany, like, all this fucking enema ass porn and the Japanese with the bukkake.  You're trying to say, uh, they're more intelligent in Germany than, than here in the United States?  No, no, he's saying that this, he's saying as opposed to other cultures where they just  put it in and knock them up.  Right.  But I, I understand what you're saying, but I think that's more based in repression. 
[00:56:00]  Like, Japan is a very repressed society.  Yeah.  Yeah, and boredom.  And boredom.  Boredom?  Well, Japan, I'm saying, is very sexually repressed.  Like, you know how, like, they're very proper, and they're very, very strict, and they're  very discipline-driven, so that's their chance to be really, like, you know what I mean?  It's almost like, uh, guys that are really dominant tend to be submissive, and women  that are real bitches in the office and run the thing want to be spanked.  It's just, it's, it's like that, that, that vent, it seems.  Yep.  Well, I made my point.  You get the idea.  I'm putting it.  Yeah, yeah, you know, I don't even disagree with it.  I just think it, I don't know if that ties in as well. 
[00:56:30]  All right.  Keith, let's go.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hi, Keith.  And first, I just wanted to say what you were talking about yesterday real quick.  Axiom is getting all of my money solely for you guys.  Well, there's a lot of people that got the service because of us so far.  But, uh, I was telling the guy who answers the phone, yeah, my, my fetish is, uh, I look  for porn where black guys are fucking fat white chicks, but I like the ones where they  do the vaginal cum shots, and they come inside them.  Cream pies. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  Cream pies.  What's a cream pie?  What?  When you finish internally, it's a, it's an internal pop.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  The money shot seems to be the closer.  Yeah, but it's black, specifically black guys fucking fat white chicks.  Not regular white chicks, but fat white chicks.  What does your mom look like?  I'm not even kidding.  Jimmy's an expert at this time.  I'm not.  I just say, you never know.  I mean, we're all, I'm not even being, is your mom fat?  No.  All right.  Because that could be a hatred of mommy.  Ooh.  I could watch her railed by young criminals. 
[00:57:30]  You never know.  You know, I got to bring it up again.  One of the hottest movie scenes ever was the black drug dealer banging Julia Stiles.  That was not hot.  No, that wasn't hot.  In traffic.  That was disturbing.  That was disturbing.  That disturbed me.  That was unhot.  That was beyond hot.  No.  God damn, what is wrong with you?  And I was discussing that with my brother at Mardi Gras, and he's with me.  What is wrong with you?  My brother Brett thinks it's one of the hottest scenes ever, too.  What's hot about it?  Huh?  What, Keith? 
[00:58:00]  Take me out of the car crash.  I got to go.  No, you did fine.  No, I don't think that disturbed me.  Oh, what's wrong with you?  She was a well-to-do girl from the suburbs, nice family, and her addiction was so bad  that she was in, like, a crack den, and this is what she had to do to get her drugs.  It's disturbing, not hot.  I picture someone I love having to do that.  It's like, ugh, just creep me out.  Oh, oof.  Creep me out.  It was, I'm telling you, man.  I don't know what it is, but it was hot. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, my God.  And the father's just so close to finding her, but just missing the dad's nightmare.  Oh, the father's nightmare.  Yeah, it's just disturbing.  I have a fine line of what turns me on, but whenever it seems like someone's truly being  victimized, it just, like, creeps me out.  Yeah, that doesn't work for me at all.  She wasn't being victimized.  Victimization.  In the end, she was getting her drugs.  No, I know that.  She volunteered.  She showed up.  He didn't put a gun to her head.  She showed up.  She was in her drug euphoria. 
[00:59:00]  That's victimized.  And there you have it.  Did you guys see another drug movie, which was Requiem for a Dream?  No.  That movie disturbed me so much, I had to walk around my apartment for a half hour.  It was with Ellen Burstyn, who was phenomenal.  And there's one scene in there where it's about doing drugs, and the guy gets in jail, and  he's got gangrene on his arm from shooting dope.  And who else was in that?  One of the Waynes brothers, I think it was Marlon, was great in that.  And the girlfriend of his goes to see, who was the black guy? 
[00:59:30]  It was, what's that?  No, no, no, no, no.  From Platoon, his name is the same.  Keith David, David Keith.  One is white, one is black.  The one from Platoon, the black guy, plays a drug dealer.  And the girls, he'll only give the girls money, give the girls dope if they come over and  give them a hummer or do a dildo show in front of a group full of guys.  And she was going over to his house and seeing him, and it was just so disturbing.  Because you can picture your girlfriend or someone you love having to do that.  It's just awful.  Oh, damn.  Yeah, that is just, you know. 
[01:00:00]  Go ahead, call me prejudice.  No, no, anybody, even if it was a white drug, it just would have annoyed me that somebody  had to do that.  The other movie that had that hot scene was with, what was it, Meg Tilly?  Where she was banging, banging the dude while her boyfriend or husband was tied up in the  other room watching.  That was hot.  That was really hot.  How do you love those victim movies?  That movie sucked.  What was it called?  Runaway or something like that?  Yeah.  Because the guy was the victim in that one.  Yeah.  And she was volunteering to bang. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, all of a sudden she fell in love with her kidnapper or whatever, and then they're  banging, and the guy's tied up in the other room.  And they kind of, they left the door open for a while, and then they closed it and said,  you pervert, stop looking at something like that to a guy.  Oh, something about that scene too, man.  That's really bad stuff.  Let's go to Shit Dick Killer from Whack Bags.  Hey, what's up, buddy?  Hey, what's up, y'all?  I got to tell you, man, the hottest love scene I've seen in a movie had to be the racist 
[01:01:00]  Billy Bob Thornton just anal banging Halle Berry in Monster's Ball.  How's it going?  Yeah, I don't, was he doing the poop shoot, though?  No.  No, but he's just...  I think at one point he was.  See, black guys didn't like watching that either.  Really?  Black guys.  I bet you they didn't.  Black guys did not enjoy that scene.  Yeah.  Good.  Welcome to our awful wives.  Yeah, why did they, why did they start banging?  There was a desperation in that one too, right?  Yeah.  Well, her son Patrice had been killed on the side of the road. 
[01:01:30]  No.  What?  Well, it was a fat kid, yeah.  Oh, it was.  Oh, it was.  That's what it was.  I just saw the sex scene.  I didn't see that one.  It was a mother that lost her son.  Oh, he's a big fat dummy, and they're walking in the rain, and you hear a thud, and you  hear her, like, scream.  And next thing you know, you got Billy Bob Thornton just banging her.  Yeah.  Puffy Combs was in that.  Sean, Pete Diddy.  Doesn't she look at him and just go, F me?  I don't remember.  She just, like, yeah.  Yeah, and all of a sudden, she just looks at me, looks at me, Jesus, I wish, looks at 
[01:02:00]  Billy Bob and says, F me.  I just saw that sex scene, like the clip of the sex.  It's a great sex scene.  You ever see the one from Brown Bunny, the Hummer?  That is a really sexy, what's his name, Vincent Gallo, gets a hardcore Hummer.  Oh, yeah, they talk about that.  I didn't see that one.  It was such a hot scene.  Yeah?  Yeah, because it's real.  I mean, that's exactly what a guy's like when he's getting a Hummer.  It wasn't any of that, you know, porn overdone stuff. 
[01:02:30]  Best Hummer scene was Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone at Casino.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Oh, yeah, that was a good one.  You need a sponsor?  She had no choice.  It was just like...  She's crying.  Okay, nodding.  I love when he's talking about veal and he gets in the car and he just grabs the girl's  head and he drops her head in his lap.  Let's go to Rick. 
[01:03:00]  Rick, what's going on?  Hey, I'm just recognizing, like, the enjoyment you get out of this,  it's a rich chick getting railed by the drug dealer.  Oh, it's another one.  Ah, good tie-in.  Maybe it's the fact that the girl is rich in the movie.  Yep.  Yeah, I...  Good point.  Because you heard Ope...  Jesus.  Did you hear Ope say he likes when the drug dealer grabs the rich girl and throws her nice  packaged lunch on the floor and steps on it?  What is that scene from?  Brown Bunny, Chloe Sevigny. 
[01:03:30]  Where'd you find the still shots of the BJ scene?  I heard William Morris dropped her for this.  Jesus, she's actually doing it.  That's what I'm saying.  It was a hardcore scene.  Shot in Europe.  It was really sexy.  Did he finish?  I think he did in her mouth.  Money shot?  No, no, no, no.  That's what it was great about it.  It was for real.  And I believe that William Morris was her agency and they dropped her if she agreed to do the scene.  Wait, if people are at home at their computers, they've got to see how hot this is, man.  Dude, that was a sexy scene.  Where can you find this, Eric?  With a video.  NitroVideo.com 
[01:04:00]  NitroVideo.com  And look, Steve's already in here.  Don't worry, it'll be up on FoundryMusic.com  No, it won't.  I need the hits on my website.  No, no, no.  I ain't posting this, but I'll post the link.  You can get it on Mr. Skin, too.  Couldn't you also go Google, like, Brown Bunny oral scene or whatever?  Maybe.  Yeah, Google it, because the video is very sexy.  Why would she agree to that?  I don't know.  Why not?  Really, I mean, probably what she had to do to get the part to begin with, so why not roll the camera?  What other movies was she in?  Oh, at the time. 
[01:04:30]  Gallow was Chloe Sevigny's boyfriend.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Okay.  And that's why she did it.  Oh, I didn't know that.  I think you're right about William Morris dropping her, though.  That takes away some of the hotness for me.  I thought it was just an actress.  I didn't realize that they were actually dating.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right, let's go to John in New York City.  John?  Yo.  Hey, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Remember the movie Kids?  I didn't see it.  I didn't see that either.  Chloe Sevigny, whatever the hell her name is.  She got banged.  Ten Ways to Heaven on that one, man.  There's a couple of good ones.  They're all like 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds host me, at least. 
[01:05:00]  That's the movie.  All right.  Yeah.  John, I got a bail on you.  Your phone stinks.  Yeah.  Sorry, Gunn.  Probably a good point to take a break.  I guess we should play one of our favorite things as we go to break in honor of Jim's little...  Oh, one more sex scene that I thought was really a good one.  Oh, you actually were the one that turned me on to this movie.  Oh, Swimming Pool?  Yeah.  Swimming Pool?  Everyone loves that movie.  I didn't see it.  Oh, my God. 
[01:05:30]  It's about some chick and...  Dude, it's the hottest movie you could see.  Oh, my God.  I don't even remember what the story was.  It's a writer.  It's an old writer.  And she has a writer's block.  So she goes to, I think, her book agent's kind of slash villa mansion type thing.  Yeah, kind of away from it all.  In the country to think and try to come up with this next novel.  Yeah.  And then you're not really sure if she's imagining all this stuff that's going on with the agent's daughter. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, so then the agent's daughter shows up at the house unexpectedly.  And she's supposed to be how old?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Move the cursor.  Can I see that?  There it is.  Look at this chick.  She's supposed to be 17.  This chick is the hottest girl out there, man.  And she brings home guys from the bars and just has sex with them.  And the woman, this old prudy writer, has to listen to them having sex.  Yeah, as she's trying to write her novel.  Swimming Pool?  Yeah.  Did you take a look at her?  Look how hot this girl is.  She really is sexy. 
[01:06:30]  I mean, this movie is...  Who's the blonde with her?  Oh, that's...  You old school marm.  That's the old lady.  And then later on in the movie, she gets completely naked.  Any more of those?  Yeah.  But, yeah, if you haven't seen Swimming Pool, I don't know if it's a good movie.  There's just some really great hot scenes in there.  She bashes the one guy with a brick.  Oh, nice.  There she is taking everything off.  Yeah, she's completely nude with a big rock and committing a murder.  But that was a hot sex scene. 
[01:07:00]  Her having sex with the guy she brought home from the bar.  Pretty good stuff.  Keep that website up during the commercial.  Before you go to commercial.  Oh, she's...  Yeah, that's the scene where she's in the pool, up to her ass in water.  A guy is sitting on the edge of the pool, and she's giving him a hummer.  Yeah, good stuff.  You want to talk about disturbing scenes?  Hands down, the most disturbing sex scene I've ever seen. 
[01:07:30]  It's in a French movie called Irreversible.  Oh, someone's got that on the line.  Go ahead.  There is a rape scene in that movie.  It is so disturbing.  Really?  It is such an upsetting scene, man.  It's brilliant.  It's brutal.  And it's an absolutely...  I guarantee you that's what a real rape scene is.  I haven't seen that.  It's French, and the movie, Irreversible, kind of goes backwards.  It's a really weird film, but it's good.  It's stupid French.  Nah, but it's a really interesting movie. 
[01:08:00]  I do, too.  They stink.  And if an American had raped this girl, it wouldn't have been as bad,  but it was a French on French, so I kind of felt like, you know...  But it was such an awful scene.  With the guy in a Nazi uniform, just raping her?  No, that would have been kind of hot, actually.  Clothed in a French flag.  Would have been good.  A little subtle.  Sick F is online.  Sick F.  Yo.  What's up, buddy?  Do you guys remember that really, really delicate scene?  I mean, it wasn't that hardcore as some of the ones you're talking about,  but in 8mm?  I didn't see it. 
[01:08:30]  8mm.  Yeah.  Nicholas Cage, right?  Yeah, I saw that one a while ago.  I thought you were going to talk about Devil's Advocate.  No, no, no, no, no.  That's just for the call screen.  No, the real delicate scene in 8mm,  where the guy is chopping the fucking girl into, like, little bits.  That was kind of cute.  I hated 8mm.  That could have been a really good...  No, that was just to get through the phone screener.  Oh, great.  8mm could have been a good movie if it didn't star Nicholas Cage doing the exact same acting  that he does in every other movie.  Dude, I was never a fan of his. 
[01:09:00]  I liked it in Leaving Las Vegas.  That's it.  I'm sorry.  What was the Vegas movie?  What was the Leaving Las...  No, no, no, no.  Was it where he plays an alcoholic?  Yeah.  He was Leaving Las Vegas.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's right.  But he plays...  He acts the same way in every movie, whether it's a comedy or...  Yeah.  I had enough with Nicholas Cage.  Like Coppola's nephew.  That's how he acts.  He was good in Valley Girl with Deborah Foreman, though.  That was a fine one from the 80s.  I had a big crush on her.  Rich in Philly.  I love the cooler. 
[01:09:30]  I don't remember the hot scene in that.  You don't remember that scene?  The one with William H. Macy?  Antsword recently.  What's the scene?  He has sex with the young girl, right?  Oh, yeah.  A couple times.  They even show his nice little old ass.  No, with the girl?  With the hooker girl or whatever she was?  With the girl that used to be on ER.  I don't remember her name, though.  She's not hot.  She had an awful ass.  There's a scene where they're both on their...  I said it's not him.  Yeah, right. 
[01:10:00]  There's a scene where they're both on their knees,  like making sounds to annoy the people in the next motel room.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And her ass is horrid.  They show from behind.  It's this saggy, like, nasty ass.  She wasn't hot.  She had bad tits.  She wasn't really that hot.  It was a good movie, but not for that.  On the Opie and Anthony Show, we're going to make fun of people with Down Syndrome.  I just didn't want to be in the middle of the flight and have him yank that handle hoping candy comes out and blow the door off the plane. 
[01:10:30]  We all get sucked out except for him because his head gets stuck.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Lo más malo de Opie and Anthony en XM2-02.  All right, we were talking about the mother of the astronaut.  Yes.  Fox 5 just interviewed her.  We got a few clips, Anthony.  Shuttle to murder.  She's very, very angry with Mary.  Her son, a Queens native, I believe, right?  Yeah.  And, you know, now she's wondering if her son's going to come back in one piece. 
[01:11:00]  Mm-hmm.  So here's the exclusive interview with Fox 5.  Well, I didn't hear that they had grounded it until somebody called me and told me.  All I had heard is that the piece was a small piece.  Then somebody called me and told me it was as big as a pillow.  I didn't know that Lynn Samuels had a son that was an astronaut.  That's wonderful.  My son, the astronaut.  You could just see her bragging outside her little house. 
[01:11:30]  Those houses that are two feet wide all next to each other.  Right.  Did you hear about my son, the astronaut?  He's in space now, the astronaut.  Would your son a doctor, a lawyer?  I have an astronaut.  I'm very upset here.  Just smoke it as he's talking.  Very dangerous.  It's the size of a pillow.  I've got to hear that again.  The mother of one of the astronauts.  Well, I didn't hear that they had grounded it until somebody called me and told me. 
[01:12:00]  All I had heard is that the piece was a small piece.  Then somebody called me and told me it was as big as a pillow.  It was as big as a pillow.  So I'm suing for punitive damages here.  I was watching the shuttle launch.  I was very angered.  They said they were pieces, but it was the size of a pillow and my shoes. 
[01:12:30]  I saw the pieces.  Well, I couldn't see them because my glasses, I can't see, god damn it.  My son's an astronaut and it's tearing the ass out of me.  Oh, man.  She didn't know.  So she's going to sue everybody.  What a typical mom.  Oh, it's classic.  Just like, you know, you try to tell your mom about what you do in life, like this radio show.  And she still thinks I'm just playing with my friends, you know, that it's not a career that I should, you know, maybe get something to fall back on. 
[01:13:00]  Same thing with this guy, probably.  You want to go into space?  You want to be on a rocket ship?  Why don't you learn a trade?  Be a plumber like your uncle.  At least learn a trade.  If the astronaut thing doesn't work out, you could always earn a good wage.  My mom had that conversation with me.  Isn't that great?  So I got a minor in computers.  Oh.  And you know me, I'm the worst at computers. 
[01:13:30]  Is that what you did?  Yes.  A computer minor.  The speech worked?  Mine didn't.  My mother's speech didn't work.  Thank God.  A minor in computers?  Oh, it's awful.  Back then?  That's when they were teaching computer languages.  That must have been great.  Like Fortran and, uh, uh...  Pascal.  Cobalt.  Cobalt.  And, uh...  Basic.  Turbo Pascal.  Pascal.  Basic.  What? 
[01:14:00]  I will now learn the if-then commands.  Right.  If two equals four, then go to 150 syntax error, motherfucker.  Yeah.  Thank you to the guy that took that out of play.  Oh, God.  No one has to worry about that crap.  You just have to program shit yourself.  I was so in on the early part of computing, and I loved gaming, but you actually had to program your own fucking games. 
[01:14:30]  I got a book with program language in it, and you used to have to program in Basic for a game.  And it would never fail.  Syntax error, line 112095, and trying to debug the goddamn thing.  Yeah, Tandy, Commodore computers.  I had the Atari 800XL.  And just trying to program those things.  Ugh.  Just so you could play some stupid-ass game.  Oh, yeah.  All right, back to the mother, Anthony. 
[01:15:00]  Yes.  I'm very upset over here.  Talking about her son, who's up there in space, and she's very worried.  Oh.  Well, I'm confident that they could fix it.  I don't know whether they'll be able to fix it in space, but they always told us, and this is what they've been saying,  that they'll get the astronauts back.  You know, that there was a backup flight going up this, they had to, you know, stay on the station. 
[01:15:30]  So, that's what I'm hoping that that'll take place.  This, dude, this is the mother of one of the astronauts who obviously doesn't tell her shit.  Either that, or they sit down for coffee, and she just, I don't know about all this space stuff.  Tell me, but how would the kids?  Right.  Like, she doesn't care, or want to know, or know anything.  I hear there's a flight going up. 
[01:16:00]  I think it's Delta.  They've scheduled flights.  They did have some, like, harebrained scheme of using the Atlantis if something goes wrong,  but, I mean, their backup plan is using the Soyuz to bring them down with the Russians.  There's some type of other flight.  I believe it stops at Newark Liberty Airport.  Why don't we, uh...  I want my son in first class, goddammit. 
[01:16:30]  And he eats a vegetarian meal.  All right, why don't we go to the third clip, because we got Elo standing by here.  Oh!  The mom of, uh, the astronauts.  Elo.  One of the astronauts.  As a mom, though, you have to just kind of sit and watch and wait and hope and pray  and have faith that it'll all turn out, right?  Right.  And Charles always had faith.  He never shouted for a minute that everything would be all right.  He, you know, it's the mothers that worry, not them. 
[01:17:00]  And, uh, like Eileen even always said, we wouldn't be going up if we thought that anything  was going to happen.  Oh, my God.  That's a very interesting Babe Ruth clip.  I have loved baseball for many years.  That's fantastic.  Isn't that great?  Make sure you wear clean drawers up there.  Right.  Because, God forbid, something happens and they recover your underwear and it's dirty. 
[01:17:30]  I'll look like a bad mother.  Yes, you can just...  Fantastic, then.  You can just hear the other side of that conversation, the astronaut.  Yes, Mom.  Oh, yes, Mom.  Yes, I'll be visiting soon, Mom.  What if something goes wrong?  There's a backup flight, Mom.  There's somebody who's going to fly up and take us home.  Make sure you call me when you get there.  Yes, Mom.  Call me.  Leave, even if I'm not here, leave a message. 
[01:18:00]  Me and your father would probably be out.  But leave a message on the machine.  On the recorder device.  Now I've got to go watch my cereal, so leave me alone.  I'm going to watch my programs.  So you call from your shuttle.  Call from the shuttle.  And let me know you arrived okay.  Right.  It doesn't matter what you do for a living.  This guy's in space.  Right.  He's an astronaut. 
[01:18:30]  And you know he's embarrassed because it goes right back to being in school.  Hey, dude, your mom was on TV this morning.  Did you see your mother on TV?  Hey.  Yeah, she just worries.  She's a little worried.  I'm very worried about him.  Did she pack your lunch, dude?  You can just see them just killing them up there.  I hope you're eating well.  Hey, this is Michael Rapoport, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  NBC Nightly News anchor Tom Brokaw is going to be donning his hiking boots, Anthony. 
[01:19:00]  Really?  And he's going to be reporting live from Yellowstone National Park.  Yellowstone?  What's he doing there?  I have no idea what he would be doing in Yellowstone National Park.  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  Live from Yellowstone National Park, where I will be investigating where all the picnic 
[01:19:30]  baskets seem to be disappearing to.  The prime suspect is Yogi Bear, who I will be speaking to later, and his cohort, Boo Boo.  Live from Yellowstone National Park.  Tom?  Yes, yeah.  You sound extra woozy today.  Well, a little groggy.  It seems I went to go see Old Faithful, the geyser.  Yeah.  And I was told to put my face down in the hole to take a look, because I'm an investigative 
[01:20:00]  journalist.  So I was investigating the hole when the geyser went off and shot me up about 100 feet in  the air and lowered me back down.  So I'm a bit woozy.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  He's live from Yellowstone.  Is Yogi Bear the picnic basket culprit we will learn tonight?  Or is it just a plot, a ploy by Ranger Smith to try to make an arrest in these crimes that 
[01:20:30]  have been going on playing in the park for many years?  Could it be Ricochet Rabbit?  I haven't seen Ricochet Rabbit a few times when he runs away after his ping, bing, bing.  Yeah.  All I see is a cloud of smoke and a streak.  Who knows what he's doing in the interim?  He could be the picnic basket thief.  You know, this crime has gone unsolved for many years, and Ranger Smith was very desperate 
[01:21:00]  to find a perp, as he likes to put it.  We even talked with Jeopardy Dog.  Jeopardy Dog, yeah.  He just seemed to laugh and not say much and act very stupid.  And I spoke earlier with a huckleberry hound who couldn't speak to me long and then hopped 
[01:21:30]  in a funny-looking car and drove away.  But Tom Brokaw getting to the bottom of his picnic basket for a debacle from Yellowstone.  The what?  Debacle.  Oh, debacle.  Okay.  I don't think this crime has been handled right from the start.  There should have been more investigation.  Very important stuff.  Why are they pegging this on Yogi?  He seems like a jolly fellow.  There are signs all over. 
[01:22:00]  Don't feed the bear.  And why would Boo Boo hang out with him?  Well, I'll be investigating tonight.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  Well, thank you, Tom, for stopping by today.  All right, there he goes.  Tom Brokaw, everyone.  It's the worst.  I'll be in Anthony.  All right, we've got to go to the phone real fast.  Dee Dee's checking in.  Remember Dee Dee from Washington?  She does the news for us every once in a while?  She was going on a hot date, Anthony, because her parents were in town for two weeks, so she  couldn't get any action. 
[01:22:30]  Of course.  So she was setting herself up for a nice sex weekend.  Hi.  What's up, Dee Dee?  Hi.  Bill.  Didn't that sound like that?  Wee.  Yeah.  Wee.  I told you I'd call in about my date for the weekend.  Yeah, so set us up.  So the parents were in town for two weeks, so you couldn't...  For two long weeks.  Were you at least masturbating after they went to bed?  Because you're...  No, because I felt weird.  They're my parents.  They're in the other room.  I couldn't even release. 
[01:23:00]  It was two weeks of not being able to release.  Because you're a horny one.  I'm thinking even if your parents are staying with you, you've got to figure out how to take  care of yourself for a while there.  They're my parents.  All right, so they're in the other room.  I'm a good Catholic girl, kind of.  Were they banging?  I don't even want to know.  They're so good.  All right.  Well, so they finally left town.  Yeah, thank God.  Thursday.  And you had a hot weekend?  Mm-hmm.  It ended about midnight last night.  Oh.  When did it start?  What? 
[01:23:30]  When did it start?  Friday.  Start of Friday, ended last night.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  Who was tied up?  A little bit of both.  Really?  Yes.  Is this a co-worker?  No.  No?  This would be, you know, my delivery man.  Jesse?  No.  Steve.  Wait, you're back to the UPS guy?  Yeah.  My UPS, Steve.  What's his name?  Steve.  Oh, okay.  Steve.  Steve.  I just want to tie you up and spank you. 
[01:24:00]  I want to paddle your bottom.  So, Steve came over Friday.  Friday evening, yes.  Friday evening.  Had some dinner, watched a movie, then.  Yeah, what'd you watch?  You were able to eat dinner and watch a movie before getting into some action?  Well, we had a little bit of action, too, beforehand.  Yeah.  Did he wear his uniform?  No.  No?  Doesn't work weekends, I guess?  No, no.  He's off on the weekend. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, walk us through this.  Come on.  Oh, God.  Well, what do you want to know?  Well, you guys did the dinner, and what movie did you watch?  I don't even remember.  It was some lame-ass movie on TV.  Oh, my God.  You guys were having sex watching the movie, right?  Probably, yeah.  On the couch, yes.  Oh.  A little on the couch?  Yeah.  Did you tie him up?  Well, not until we got to the bedroom.  So, what did you do on the couch?  You know, a little bit of floor plate stuff.  A little cunnilingus?  Oh, my God. 
[01:25:00]  I'm not kidding.  Cunnilingus and flesh show.  Did you do a little, uh, did you get a little of that cunnilingus?  A little flesh show?  Lick, lick, lick.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Did you fillet him?  Dip his head down there.  Okay, stop.  Did he put his head down?  It sounded like he was eating a sloppy joe through a straw.  Oh, my God.  Did you fillet him or what?  I can't.  Okay.  With a little, a little bit.  Gave him a little gag. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, sir.  I'll give him a little gag.  Does he use little UPS euphemisms when you're having sex?  Like when he's going to come, does he say, get ready for Saturday delivery?  Oh, my God.  That would be fun.  Thank you for that idea, Norton.  Yeah.  All right.  So, you go to the bedroom.  Now what?  Well, you know, I tied him up.  You tied him up?  Yeah.  With what?  I had these, like, little, like, satin kind of like, I don't know what you would call them, 
[01:26:00]  like, rope sashes or whatever.  Were they made out of satin?  Yes, they were made out of satin.  Is he tied up?  Satin.  Is he tied up or could he get out at any given moment?  Well, he didn't, but I guess he could if he really wanted to try.  I don't get that whole tied up thing.  Just don't even get it.  I didn't get it until I did it for the first time, and then I got it, and I was like, whoa.  Oh, I'm tied up.  It's a power trip for you.  I don't know what it is and why.  I don't like it all the time, but with certain people, it's okay. 
[01:26:30]  So, they made a cloth, these things?  Like, out of satin.  There's, like, a whole bunch of things you could use.  Wait, what are they made out of?  You like how it's satin.  Oh, okay.  Satin, satin.  Satin.  Satin.  I drive a satin.  A satin.  Satin.  Satin.  Sorry.  All right.  Guys getting tied up is so ridiculous because it's like, oh, you've tied me up.  Gee, don't fuck me.  You know?  It's like, if you tie a girl up, she can play off this fantasy like, ah, I don't want to be fucked, 
[01:27:00]  and then all of a sudden you're banging her.  But a guy is like, with a huge rod, you're going to be laying there going, oh, please.  Oh, what are you going to do?  Oh, I hate that you've tied me up because now you can fuck me at will and I can't fight you off.  It's ridiculous.  You ever get tied up and have to hold your own restraints because you get out?  You slip right out of them.  Oh, I'm tied up.  Oh.  Please don't.  Oh, geez.  It slipped out.  Okay.  Please don't use me as a toilet, you know. 
[01:27:30]  I mean, you know, yeah.  I'm tied up.  All right, so he's tied up.  Now what?  Okay, do I have to go into all details?  Yes.  Are you naked at this point?  What?  Yeah.  Are you naked?  Well, yeah, we both are.  Are you going down on his rod?  I guess you could say that, yeah.  Did you strap one on, Didi?  What?  Oh, you did?  No.  Come on.  See, that would be an answer to the tied up thing.  Yeah.  Because that would be like, oh, please don't, you know, oh, don't have sex with me, don't.  Okay, look, we're not fucking around anymore.  Put that fucking thing away. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  Untie me.  Untie me, bitch.  Green, green, green, green, green, green, green, green.  I didn't say green all weekend.  No.  No one said green all weekend, huh?  No.  Oh, look at you.  All right, so what was...  Oh, come on.  It was two weeks.  So what was the big moment for you?  You had him tied up.  What do you do to a guy when he's tied up?  Oh, sometimes he likes a little bit of pain.  So, you know, nipple clamps or whatever.  Do you do any cockball torture?  No, no, no, I don't do that. 
[01:28:30]  Is that twisting and mutilating?  No, not mutilating.  I guess just twisting.  The nipple clamps.  Now you're tied up and you've got the big rod happening.  Now you've got your nipping and nipple clamps.  That's awful.  Well, some people are, you know, into that.  Do you smother him at all?  Sit on his face?  Say that again, Norris.  Do you smother him at all?  Sit on his face?  No.  What do you do?  Just put nipple clamps on him and go, huh?  No.  Hey, how about that?  Look at you now.  Look what I do now.  Look what I do to you now. 
[01:29:00]  All right, so you've got the nipple clamps on.  Then what?  That's what makes any of this ridiculous.  Yeah, because now you're sitting there like, yeah, you got me.  I got the nipple clamps.  And you've got to think the guy's just going, when are we just going to fuck?  We all do silly stuff in bed and you're just, I don't know.  I don't know what you're going to have to do.  You're so close the whole time, just bursting out laughing.  Yeah.  Because the whole act is ridiculous.  Because now you're tied up his arms and his legs.  He's got the rod and he's got the nipple clamps on.  I'm laughing at this point if it's me.  I'm laughing.  I'm like, what are you doing? 
[01:29:30]  You're like, this is silly.  This is really silly.  So what do you do next?  You just kind of pull on the nipple clamps.  Taser his yambag.  And what does he do, scream for more?  Or does he have to, what?  Sometimes he'll scream for more.  Yeah.  And what are you saying?  You're a bad boy.  Yeah.  I'm going to fuck the FedEx guy.  Yeah.  There's a five-car pileup on the LIE.  Ow.  That one sounds like it hurt.  So what do you do?  So do you have a feather, too, or something? 
[01:30:00]  Actually, I do.  And then I also have, like, a few lips.  You got a crop, a riding crop?  Are you cropping across his belly or something?  You know what?  Next time you're in town, I'll just bring the equipment in and you can look at it.  Good idea.  Hey, do you smack his penis with the riding crop a little?  A little bit, yeah.  You've done this before, haven't you, Norton?  No, I'm just very familiar with it.  I'm not really a submissive, to be honest.  You're a dominant?  I don't know what I am.  I just don't want to be tied up.  You're a pervert.  Yeah, I'm just filthy.  John wants to know if you used a ball gag on him. 
[01:30:30]  No.  Like the gimp?  No, okay.  The gimp, no.  So, all right, he's got the nipple clamps, he's got the feather, you're pulling on the  nipple clamps a little bit.  What else?  Yeah, just a little bit of, like, you just talk kind of rough.  What do you say?  I don't know.  I invited Zed over to fuck him in the ass.  Yeah, I did.  Yeah, give us some of the dialogue.  No, I can't.  You've got to.  Give us some of the Dee Dee dialogue.  Here I am.  I'm tired.  Ooh, I can't move, Dee Dee.  Ow!  Oh, those clips hurt.  Now what do you do?  Come on, Dee Dee.  Come on.  I'll just tell him to shut his whining. 
[01:31:00]  Shut your fucking whining.  Whoa.  And then what do you do?  I can't do this.  Stop whining.  Yeah, what do you do now?  Stop whining.  Because I'm still whining.  I'm who?  I can't.  How do you say stop your whining?  I say stop your fucking whining.  Stop whining.  Really?  Stop whining.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Stop it!  And then he gets fake scared, right?  Oh, he acts like he's really scared.  Quiet.  You think he's faking it?  And then that gives you a little power, right?  Yeah.  And it gets you even more moist. 
[01:31:30]  Now we're having fun.  Oh, my God.  Stop whining.  And then do you climb aboard?  I guess you could say that, yeah.  Climb aboard.  All aboard!  All aboard, everybody!  All aboard!  And then eventually you let him go and he just has his way with you, right?  Then what happens at the end?  Oh, what do you think happens?  Use your imagination.  But do you let him go and then he has his way with you, or do you just ride him that way?  For a while, yeah, sure.  I do that.  I can't do it.  Then you untie him, and are you then a little submissive? 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, and then I'm the submissive one.  You're on the bottom?  A little bit of roller plane.  Bottom, top, or both?  What do you like?  A little bit of both.  Yeah?  Yes.  Did he spank you?  Of course he did.  All right, this is the fast round.  Come on, guys, because she only has like 30 seconds.  Okay, you know what?  How many times did you come?  Let's just say we were both very happy numerous times.  Numerous times, okay.  Come on, I had my whole weekend here.  What does he say to you when he spanks you? 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, what does he say to you when he spanks you?  You bad girl, you.  Yeah, you like that.  You like that.  Well, we use the F word a lot.  You tell me about all the cock you suck when I'm not here, you bad girl.  Hold on, keep talking, Opie.  Yeah, Opie.  Yeah.  You'd be good at that.  You go pass out and marry some English counterfeiter.  Yeah, you bad girl.  Actually, never mind.  That counterfeiter is an asshole. 
[01:33:00]  Well, what else?  Come on, DeeDee.  Um, you know.  What does he say to you, sweetie?  Yeah, what does he say to you?  He might be listening.  Good.  This is going to hurt me more than it hurts you.  Yeah.  I told you to do better in your studies.  Yeah, do you role play?  Do you make believe you're a little girl or anything like that with him?  Sometimes I am a little girl, yeah.  Well, with the voice, you know.  How old?  He has a voice.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How old?  High school, college.  What a rookie.  College? 
[01:33:30]  Can you play one?  College.  You want me to be a little girl?  All right, so you're like a high school girl or a college girl, and what is he?  Okay, he likes me to say, I've been bad, Daddy.  What do you say?  Oh, I knew he'd get to that.  Okay, I got to go.  How do you say it, Dee Dee?  You don't say it.  How do you say it?  I've been bad, Daddy.  I can't say it.  Jesus.  I got it out.  You got me to say that much.  So he spanks you, and you say, I've been bad, Daddy?  I've been very bad, Daddy. 
[01:34:00]  And then you look down, and he's throbbing at that point.  But I don't smart.  You can barely get Daddy out before he just goes, oh.  So when he spanks you, do you say, like, I've been bad, Daddy, I'm the sheriff?  No.  Okay, you know what?  Next time when you guys are in town, I will bring some stuff in.  I've been bad, Daddy, huh?  I've been bad.  Very bad.  Like what?  What have you done?  I just say it.  No, no.  And then he goes, well, why are you bad? 
[01:34:30]  You know, I have to go do a report.  Daughter?  Yeah.  I have to go do a report.  Whenever you're having age play, you tell her that she's your special girl.  What?  You're my special girl.  That's what you do when you're having Daddy, daughter age play.  Oh, really, Jimmy?  Yeah.  You know that?  My special girl.  Sure.  You're my special girl.  That's right.  Could you put on a little pink tango hat and go missing?  I have to go do a report.  No?  All right, DeeDee. 
[01:35:00]  DeeDee's got to do some traffic, everyone.  Sorry.  All right, DeeDee.  That was so uncalled for.  It's so uncalled for.  And go missing.  Oh, yeah.  I've been getting emails from some of your listeners.  Oh, you have?  Yeah.  And go missing.  Yeah, they're a cordial bunch.  And?  Oh, they just want to know if I snort while I have an orgasm.  Oh.  Yeah, do you?  No.  No?  Maybe if he cracks a joke in the middle of it, you'll...  So, Dad, he spanked you, does he?  Yes, he does.  I've been bad.  Does he put it in while he spanks you? 
[01:35:30]  Well, what do you think?  Yes.  I don't know.  It depends.  A lot of people would separate those things.  And then you start yelling that you're going to be good from now on?  That type of thing?  Yeah.  I've got to go.  No, you don't.  No.  Yeah, I do.  I have to go do a Chicago, Dallas, and Minnie.  Yeah.  Tell them you've been bad, too.  I've been bad, Minneapolis.  Yeah, you should shock the hell out of the people that are stupid enough to listen to  those dumb traffic stations.  Traffic is so bad.  Right.  You want an audience on the traffic station. 
[01:36:00]  Dance on to something.  Traffic's naughty.  It's so bad.  Traffic is bad, Daddy.  Traffic is bad.  Yeah.  It's all backed up.  Yeah.  Don't go through that tunnel.  It's wet and slippery.  Oh, my God.  No.  All right.  Well, you guys have a good day.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  You too.  All right.  She's going to do traffic.  Bye, DeeDee.  But next time you're in town, I'll bring some stuff in.  Yeah, bring your toys.  Give me a notice.  DeeDee, you've been so bad.  I've been very bad. 
[01:36:30]  Very.  Very bad.  I've been very bad.  Satin.  I've been very bad.  With satin.  Satin.  Satin.  Satin.  Satin.  Satin.  Thank you, perfect diction.  Go do traffic.  Hey, Norton.  Okay, bye.  Bye.  That's it.  Come on.  Satin.  There's so much more to her.  Yeah.  She's a filthy girl.  We're just scratching the surface there.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Gut-busting.  Ab-crunching.  Boy, how bad can he get?  Have you seen a man eat his own head? 
[01:37:00]  Yes.  Now you'll get used to it.  Anthony spent $300 on fags.  Ass clowns.  Anthony.  This is the freakiest show I've ever been party to.  It should be illegal.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You guys suck.  All that talk is crazy.  The worst.  The Opie and Anthony.  I know.  I was a little impatient this morning with one of the interns.  Oh, yeah.  Let's get into that.  My God.  I'm sitting on the couch. 
[01:37:30]  We're all just in a really good mood because we got these news teasers that made us laugh  really hard.  And we got a huge story we're going to get into in a few minutes here that's going to  get people thinking and talking today.  And Anthony got his breakfast order.  We have a new crop of interns.  They're great, by the way.  Here that are in.  Some would scare the shit out of them, which is unfortunate.  What?  They're all jumpy.  They're all like little chihuahuas that wet the rug whenever their owner comes in.  They just freak out. 
[01:38:00]  And early on, when we first started the show, we got a crop of interns that turned out to  just be gold.  Right.  I hate kissing their ass and stuff, but they really did.  They turned out to be very good.  And it really raised the bar for anybody that's going to be coming into this place.  And since then, we've had some lemons, and now we have a new crop that is proving themselves  to be worthy.  Very good.  And they're so attentive in the morning with getting this food and beverage for everybody. 
[01:38:30]  So this morning, I got my bagel, toasted bagel, with some cream cheese on the side because  I like dolloping it on myself.  And I get it.  You don't like dolloping it on yourself.  You just don't want anyone else to touch anything.  Well, that's true, too.  And they always decide to put, like, a brick of cream cheese on your bagel.  What the hell is that about?  I just want a little, as the Jewish people say, a little schmear on the bagel.  That's all. 
[01:39:00]  So I need a plastic knife.  And what the hell's his goddamn name?  Mike.  Mike.  Mike.  Mike, the young go-getter.  It's Mike.  Mike, the intern.  He comes in, gives me the bagel, and then gives me one of the plastic knives.  And how does he hand me the plastic knife?  Ugh.  Ugh.  I see him walking in with the knife.  Why is that a problem?  And he's holding it by the blade.  It's just awful.  Of the plastic knife.  The side that I'm going to put in the cream cheese and put on the bagel. 
[01:39:30]  But why is that a problem?  Because it's somebody's hand.  But I would just take my shirt or whatever and just wipe it fast and boom.  Joneses are gone.  Look at all of us throughout the day.  Look at our hands.  And look what they do on a daily basis.  They're pawing through newspapers that some savage is putting on his newspaper stand.  They're, you know, up nostrils.  They're picking ears.  You're coughing into them.  I don't know what people are doing.  So then he holds the knife by the blade. 
[01:40:00]  He comes over.  And I just instantly, what popped out of my mouth, I couldn't even hold it back.  It was really funny.  It popped out of me before I even knew what I was doing.  Let me tell everyone what Howard Hughes said to the intern.  Tell me what you did.  He comes over.  This is an exact quote.  I had to write it down.  Tell me what you did.  He hands it to me and I go, tell me what you did.  Tell me what you did.  And he jumped.  He went, oh, I'll get another.  And like freaked out, ran, got another knife.  These guys are all frazzled.  They're so frazzled. 
[01:40:30]  But I didn't even go like, excuse me, the knife was it.  I just looked right at him and went, tell me what you did.  That's why you should handle that.  It jumped out of me so fast that I started laughing at myself that that even came out of me.  It was funny.  Tell me what you did.  These guys are working for free.  Then I rolled up the Daily News and smacked him on the nose.  I shoved his face on the knife on the floor and went, no, what did you do?  Bad intern.  And he knew and he ran and got you another knife. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, he'll never hand it to me blade first.  You germaphobe.  But beforehand, he'll probably stick it up the crack of his ass and then hand it to me.  I've ruined that.  I can't have him get me breakfast anymore because now I'm afraid he's going to spit in it.  Right.  You have to bring your own knife now, psychopath.  See?  In your back pocket.  I do.  I'll bring a box of plastic knives and keep them on my desk.  I had no idea you had this in you, this whole germ thing.  It's not really a germ thing.  I don't know, man.  It's not about the germs.  It really isn't.  It's about being disgusted by bodily fluids. 
[01:41:30]  I'm not afraid of the germs that are in snot.  People have this misconception that I'm a germaphobe.  I'm not afraid of germs that are in mucus.  I hate mucus.  I'm not afraid of germs that are on people's hands from earwax or that.  I just think it's disgusting.  Do you know that Anthony is the only person alive that has never picked his nose?  I don't believe he's never picked.  I've picked.  Are you sure?  I use a tissue on my finger.  Finger.  Finger.  You never just got in there?  Finger.  You never just got in there and went to town? 
[01:42:00]  No.  There have been times I've had to, but it's definitely not around any other people.  On the job site back in the day when I was working for a living?  That's what I don't understand.  You used to do some crazy things on the job site and now...  Opie, those things are necessary for your own survival.  Now, a stupid plastic knife with maybe an intern's thumbprint on it drives you nuts.  It's anybody's hand.  You used to shit in...  Spackle buckets.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The old days.  That's what I did.  And there was no toilet paper around, right?  No, no.  You had to use toilet paper.  Stop.  What would you think I was going to wipe with? 
[01:42:30]  Although, once I think I wiped with an old T-shirt.  Yeah.  And then I put it back on and continued working.  I was walking...  Me and my friend Paul McKay were walking to Seal comic books years ago, and I had to take  out one of those dumps.  It's almost like if you don't shit now, you're just going to collapse in the street.  Yeah.  Your legs actually give out on you.  We had walked three miles from home, all these comic books.  I had to go into this woods area, and I'm taking a dump, and as I'm shitting, there's  yellow jackets flying in between my legs.  What kind of a caveman dump are you taking? 
[01:43:00]  It was awful.  There was bees flying around.  I think I had to use my underwear to wipe my ass and throw it out.  Yeah, it was awful.  Sometimes you got to do what you got to do.  Old salt and vinegar potato chip crack is what I had walking.  Let's go to the Gooch in Cleveland.  Gooch!  I'm sorry, man.  I'm still laughing at Norton's.  Sorry, guys.  What do you think?  Anthony, you are going to end up with fucking plastic over your furniture like my old Italian  grandmother.  You are a complete fucking germaphobe, man. 
[01:43:30]  Complete germaphobe.  You're going to have psychosis.  No.  I saw Bubble Boy the other night.  Did you?  The John Travolta movie there?  It was Bubble Boy.  Boy in a Plastic Bubble.  Boy in a Plastic Bubble Boy.  And I was, look, I'm in a bubble.  I was, and I was, Sandy, I'm in a bubble.  I was thinking of Anthony.  All right, Gooch.  Yeah.  Later, fellas.  I got it.  Hey, by the way, Danny, can you get rid of everyone that wants to talk about my dumping  problem with their remedies?  This guy says, Anthony, I hope you never accept change from a cab driver in New York City. 
[01:44:00]  I work for New York City, and whenever a cab is involved in an accident, you can always  find a bottle of urine under the driver's seat.  That's how they go to the bathroom.  So you know they're not very clean, and they're probably dribbling on themselves if you've  ever taken a leak in any kind of a bottle or anything.  Oh, yeah.  Many times.  And, yeah, and then they're just handing your money back.  And by the way, no, I don't care.  I will never accept change from a cab driver.  Really?  I swear.  I just hand them whatever I have. 
[01:44:30]  If the ride is five bucks, I'll hand them a 20 if that's all I got, and go, yeah, keep  it.  See?  I can't touch.  Another example.  Dude, I can't touch a cab driver.  The bills are filthy, though, even if he's not touching that dirty.  No matter what money you have, it's dirty.  Yeah, but, ugh.  As long as I don't see it, see his filthy, urine-ridden hand.  It's odd to watch somebody slowly go down the slope.  I know.  I know.  It's not fast.  It's little things.  It's tiny.  I've got to start keeping a list.  It's slow.  Because you're so right. 
[01:45:00]  The slow slope.  Right, yeah.  And he's smart enough to be able to justify it, like, very, like, no, dude, it's not.  You think Howard Hughes just said, I'm a nut?  No.  Of course he didn't.  He said, oh, no, no.  It's just that, you know, five layers is what you need to open the skin.  That man was a genius.  He was.  Yes, he was.  Some people think you're a genius, Anthony.  That's right.  But another side of your brain is rotting away, man.  Something is happening.  You think something's happening?  But I'm glad to report that you're wearing a shirt I've seen before. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, right.  Okay.  And you know something?  When I put this on this morning, I went, I think this is a familiar shirt.  They might notice.  Yes, this is a, this.  Because in the dark, I thought it was a periwinkle shirt for a second.  Not that we study each other's dress habits here, but we see each other every morning,  and everyone has noticed that you just don't have a rotation.  Yeah.  This is the first shirt, and I'm not even kidding.  This is not a bit for the radio.  This is the first shirt I recognize that you have worn before.  Like, you know, Jimmy's worn that shirt.  Sabra-cadabra.  Probably a hundred times.  Probably.  Yeah.  I know you're like a periwinkle shirt with the red around the neck. 
[01:46:00]  This isn't periwinkle.  What is it?  That's cornfield blue or whatever it's called.  It's cornflower blue.  It's just a light baby blue.  Baby blue.  Yeah.  It's got like a white undertone, too.  It's like a cloud blue.  It's nice.  Yeah, you're very good.  Yeah, yeah.  Cloud.  It's not that bad.  No, it's not.  The problem with me today is I got the jeans on that I started wearing.  Oh, no. 
[01:46:30]  What day are we up to?  Oh, Jesus, no.  Thursday.  These go back to last Friday.  Last Friday.  Easily.  Yeah.  Don't you know?  Dude, I do the smell test.  We don't have big meetings or things to do after the show, so as long as it's not, you  know, reeking, I throw them back on.  Here's the thing, though.  New underwear and all that.  You rollerblade in in the hot weather.  Right.  And then you, without only, you know, bathroom breaks and stuff, but for the most part, we're  doing, we're doing no breaks for an hour, an hour and a half sometimes that you're just 
[01:47:00]  sitting.  Mm-hmm.  Sitting after sweating.  I agree.  Not good.  I do the smell test, though.  But.  Quick smell.  There's a bunch of stuff on my, on my floor.  How about just wash them instead of sniffing around?  The sad part is I got at least 10 to 12 pairs of jeans.  They're just waiting there all nice and clean and ready to go.  And then there's a bunch of jeans on my floor.  And then I, I, I do like, well, a lot of guys do.  You'd start looking around the, your bedroom floor and you pick up a few things, smell them. 
[01:47:30]  If they smell okay, you throw them back on.  If we had something important to do, then yeah, I'd make sure everything is clean.  You know what's not accurate about the smell test, though?  Sometimes on the floor, you could pick it up and it doesn't smell bad at all.  When you start wearing them, though, the second anything happens, any bodily moisture, any  sweat or anything, and it just brings out, uh, its true aroma.  It's hiding in there.  Every once in a while, I'll, I'll, uh, fail the smell test. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  And I'll be sitting here going, oh, and I just want to go home immediately.  How often do you do your laundry or have it done?  Um, really must have.  I don't know, like once every two weeks, I guess.  Oh.  Why don't you have the Pollock show up every weekend and do it?  She's too busy cleaning the rest of the place.  Her awful accent and her cigarette smoke.  Really?  She smokes?  She smokes?  Oh, yeah, she smokes outside.  They all do.  They all do, though, those Europeans.  But she likes her rock and roll.  Rock and roll.  She wants me to turn on the rock and roll.  That's right, sir.  Have her come home once a week and fetch your clothes. 
[01:48:30]  How about this for a smell test, quickly?  Me and my chick are in a restaurant, eating, and some woman has a baby.  And, uh, right in the middle of the restaurant, she goes, oh, I think somebody, you know, has  a dirty diaper or something.  Picks the baby up.  Picks this friggin' baby up.  Shoves her nose right into the baby's ass.  And, dude, starts sniffing.  You live in a whole different world.  I don't have kids, obviously.  Yeah.  You didn't know that? 
[01:49:00]  Mothers do that all the time.  In a restaurant where people are eating.  I know.  Where my children come to play with their toys.  And that she didn't have the courage to pass the kid around.  Ooh, appetizers.  That's what mothers do.  To see if the, you know, they need to change the diaper.  You know, if you're trying to eat.  In the old days, you took a little peek.  Nowadays, they just go for the quick smell.  If you're in a restaurant trying to eat, that is an inconsiderate abhead of a mother smelling  your baby's stink ass.  Go to the bathroom. 
[01:49:30]  Take your little yuck to the bathroom and shove your nose up its ass and take a whiff.  Not in front of diners.  People that are eating.  That is disgusting.  And they just think, oh, it's, you know, this is what you do when your parents and everyone's  with a parent and has a kid, right?  No, we don't.  I don't want to see that.  Ugh.  I agree with you, Anthony.  And I'm sure Jimmy does, too.  But the way you express.  Yeah, I understand.  Your displeasure is a little creepy. 
[01:50:00]  You know something?  I go home and I sit at the computer and I listen to the replay of this program.  And there are times I turn and look at the radio and I say out loud, I go, what a lunatic.  And you're talking about yourself.  And I'm talking about myself.  I swear to you.  Just yesterday, just yesterday, I went to my girlfriend and I said, I am just a whining  ass.  I don't know, but I was just, I'm like, I'm this idiot.  And I'm just, I'm whining about something. 
[01:50:30]  And I just look at the radio and go, who is this idiot on the radio?  And it was me.  It was me.  You're losing it, dude.  I'm losing my mind.  We're all losing it, though.  I think it's the hours.  I really think the hours have a lot to do with it.  I've been having a lot of discussions about this in recent weeks.  I was talking to Jimmy about it yesterday.  That was one thing we did talk about for a little while on the way home.  Yeah.  This is a very lonely existence.  Oh.  It's really lonely, man.  You do the show. 
[01:51:00]  And, you know, if we were in our 20s or something, there'd be so much to do during the day.  Yep.  But everyone you'd want to hang out with has to work.  So you're left most days hanging out by yourself.  Yeah.  There's nothing to do.  Just filling up hours of time.  And I know people are out there going, oh, poor babies.  I understand.  It's a cool lifestyle.  But it's also really strange.  And you have no nightlife.  None whatsoever.  You don't have a nightlife then.  You say, all right, well, there's nobody to hang out with during the day.  Everyone's working.  You're home alone.  Well, at least you could go out at night. 
[01:51:30]  No, you can't.  I cannot leave.  Well, I just cannot leave the house.  But I cannot go out anywhere after, like, 5.30.  5.30 in the afternoon, I start thinking about bedtime.  It's like, eh, eh, can't really get started on anything.  It's almost bedtime.  It's just weird.  Yeah.  I don't want anyone to feel sorry for us, obviously.  I do.  It's just really weird.  And I think, slowly but surely, we're all just losing it slightly.  We're losing our minds a little bit. 
[01:52:00]  Slightly, yeah.  Like when he just hands me this apple with his hands.  It's like, if you're going to...  Oh, no.  Who did that?  Yeah.  If you wash the apple, it should be handed to you with a napkin.  Yeah.  How do you think you eat an apple?  What do you think?  I'd fucking peel it first with a knife and eat it?  I know.  If somebody brought you a steak, holding the steak in their hand,  and plopped it down on the plate, would you eat it?  Or go, what the hell is your problem?  Why is an apple any different?  And I'm not a germaphobe.  I don't want to eat that.  Neither am I, Jimmy.  Directly, Stu.  I would take the apple and just shine it up on my shirt,  and I'd be all set to go. 
[01:52:30]  Shine it up real nice.  Turn it sideways.  That's got to be re-washed now.  Oh, cool.  I'll do it myself.  Get Mike.  I'll do it.  Oh, look at him running.  I'll just wash my apple.  All right.  No, it's all right.  I just...  You're little Mr. Hands all over everything, aren't you?  Is that the one who did you?  Yes, he is.  I'll do it.  I'll watch it.  Little Mr. Hands on everything.  I replaced the knife.  I got a knife in two seconds.  Yes, you did.  Yes, you did.  I fucked that.  I appreciate that.  I appreciate that.  Fucking furious George.  He's a picture of everything with his bare hands. 
[01:53:00]  He looks at it.  Furious George.  Why don't you just carry two apples, one under each armpit,  and then just drop them on the table,  so you don't inconvenience yourself.  In a starchy world wired in imperfection.  What the hell is that?  It's a bagel, but for some reason at this place,  they put it like on the grill.  One man.  It's all about me, me, me.  You challenge the status quo.  They don't have a toaster?  That annoys me.  Navigating treacherous terrain.  There's crap all over it. 
[01:53:30]  Like I'm seeing grease.  Confronting the unknown.  And there's something green on it,  which could be a pepper or a booger.  It's awful.  With a platoon of interns.  You sheep.  And military precision.  Go, go, go.  Fix it.  The rule of your witness.  A revolution.  Bagel diva.  Coming soon.  Come on.  To a bakery near you.  Are you kidding?  It's the worst.  Baby, you really need to drink more than you.  I don't do it, Anthony.  All right, really fast, a friend of ours is getting a divorce, Anthony. 
[01:54:00]  Ah.  And I don't know.  You know, I don't know.  I've hung with the couple many times.  And when, I think you sent this to me, right?  Yeah.  I was just amazed.  Absolutely amazed.  You didn't see it coming.  Not at all.  Mm-hmm.  So I'm wondering, there's got to be a really good story there.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, during our hiatus, I went out to L.A. a lot, and I've been to Barry  Williams, his house, three times.  Yep.  Had the barbecue and smoking the cigars, drinking the martinis.  Invited you to watch the sunrise, sunset. 
[01:54:30]  Which one was it?  Well, that was really quick.  I was going to say funny, and I stopped myself.  Oh.  But I was, like, doing some inline skating down on the beach there.  You know, you could go all the way to Venice Beach and Santa Monica Pier right along the  water on your skates.  It's very festive, Anthony.  Yes, I've seen it in the movies.  People are biking and running, and you could, you know, throw in some skates and just skate  along all afternoon long.  And I get a phone call from Barry.  Hey, you know, I hear you're in L.A. or whatever.  I left him a message, and he's like, yeah, I want you to come up to the top of Beverly 
[01:55:00]  Hills.  Like, he's way up top, overlooking all of, you know, Los Angeles and all that.  He's like, yeah, come up around 5, and we'll have a cigar, and we'll drink some martinis,  and we'll watch the sun go down.  And I'm like, uh, uh, let me call Anthony, because I always call Anthony when I'm in these  weird situations.  That's what Robert Reed used to say on the Brady Bunch set.  Let's watch the sun go down, Greg. 
[01:55:30]  So I'm like, uh, instead of saying, yeah, I'll be there, I'm like, I got to make a phone  call.  Yeah, he calls me up.  So I call him, like, from Venice Beach, just kind of hanging, you know, with people watching  and stuff.  I go, Anthony, here's the deal.  Barry Williams, who's been on our show many times in New York, you know, he always said,  when you're out to L.A., give me a call, and we'll hang.  And a lot of our, quote, you can't call them celebrity friends, but a lot of celebrities  that have been on our show, they always say that. 
[01:56:00]  But then you're in L.A., and you make a few phone calls, and you can't get anyone on the  phone.  No, they don't want to see you.  No, not at all.  You know, they're using you for some promotion, and that's the reality of it, and that's fine.  Yeah.  But Barry, no, he was different.  He's like, oh, my God, yeah, you're here?  Cool.  And he, you know, what I just told you, he wanted to do.  So I call up Anthony.  I'm like, Anthony, all right, drive up to the top of Beverly Hills Mountain, or whatever  it's called, have cigars, steak dinner, martinis, and, and Anthony's like, wow, that sounds  great.  Sounds great.  I'm like, do you like him? 
[01:56:30]  I'm so excited.  Is he cute?  So watch the end of Survivor.  All right, all right, all right.  So, uh, so then I finally gave you the last piece, and like, and he also said, like, make  sure you get up there at, like, five so we can watch the sunset.  Uh.  No, I'm listening, Ben.  Don't worry.  It's a little odd.  Huh?  That's a little odd.  Yeah.  That's what I said.  I go, that's a little odd.  Like, he wants to, any of these things separate aren't really that bad, but you put them all 
[01:57:00]  together, and all of a sudden you're on a date with Greg Brady.  Right, well, that's what I'm thinking, is like, all of a sudden we're sipping a martini  and smoking a cigar, and the sun's going down, and all of a sudden, like, he makes a move.  And I have to tell Barry Williams, and I'm like, gay, uh, Barry, uh, maybe this is a bad  time to tell you, because I just ate your food and drank your booze and smoked your cigars,  but, uh, I'm not gay.  He goes, you will be when the roofie hits you.  And then I can imagine, I have to, you know, tell him no, and then all of a sudden the 
[01:57:30]  sad Brady bunch of music, like, kicks in or something.  Yeah.  Greg.  I'm not gay.  Oh, gee.  So, so then I called him back.  Yeah.  Because I think you were like, well, trying to, you know, feel him out a little bit.  We're actually having a discussion as to whether he should or shouldn't go with Greg Brady,  because it might or might not be a date.  Yeah, because, but, you know, it's freaking Greg Brady. 
[01:58:00]  Of course it is.  We all grew up watching the Brady Bunch.  Brady Bunch.  Opportunity to go to his actual pad, you know.  There you go, you gotta.  So I, I called back and, uh, you know, it ends up, you know, well, my, my wife will  be doing this and my agents will be there.  And then, so I was like, oh, okay, dodge that bullet.  All right.  I'll be there at five to watch the sunset.  All of a sudden.  Yeah, right.  All right.  I'll go over Greg's house.  Everything seems fine and dandy now.  Now that I think about it.  Yeah. 
[01:58:30]  Music was following him the whole time I was at his mansion.  Here he comes.  Coming into the room with our wine.  One of the most surreal, um, moments, though, you know, you pull up to his place and you  ring the, you know, he has the gate around his, uh, his house and, uh, and all of a sudden  you ring the buzzer and you hear Barry's voice like, who's there or whatever.  And I'm like, hey, it's Opie.  And he's all happy, you know.  And then all of a sudden the front door opens and then you're thinking to yourself,  is that Greg Brady coming to let me into his house? 
[01:59:00]  It's like the strangest feeling ever.  Hey, here he comes.  Just a minute.  I'll be right there.  Yeah, all happy.  Dude running down those stairs.  Does the inside of his house look like the Brady Bunch house?  That would disappoint me if it didn't, right?  Did you pull up into that driveway by the carport and walk over the AstroTurf to the sliding  glass door and walk into the little den area off the kitchen?  Alice making your dinner for the night? 
[01:59:30]  That's terrific.  Step in one of Tiger's logs in the kitchen and you're wiping up with Oliver's face?  See Mr. Brady come down in his robe looking all weak and skinny?  So then I go in and he goes, you want a tour of the place?  And we're walking around and I don't know, all of a sudden on the wall there's like pictures  of him when he was a lot younger obviously.  When he was Greg.  Right.  Groovy Greg.  And there's like a picture of him surfing and I go, wow, where was it taken? 
[02:00:00]  I swear to God.  Just thinking because it's like, of course you know where it was taken.  No, but I'm thinking, you know, it's like any other, like if I'm walking around your  place and you have some photo of you on vacation and he goes, oh, that was taken in Hawaii.  And I'm like, of course it was.  Hawaii.  Of course.  The Hawaiian episode.  And I'm like, I was looking at pictures of the, you know, when he wasn't filming the  Hawaiian episode of him just hanging, surfing and doing whatever.  Did he have the evil tiki on?  No.  The bad luck tiki?  No.  And it was just really weird.  And then in his living room he had like every episode of the Brady Bunch on VHS tapes. 
[02:00:30]  And it was just strange to be like, you know, because it was all like, you know, Brady  Bunch stuff.  How much did he have that on display?  That's kind of creepy.  Not that on.  That is kind of weird.  No, it's like, you know, you have your films or whatever that you like.  Yeah, but it's, I mean, it's within arm's reach.  He could pick out an episode, pop it in the VCR and show people.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That is weird.  That is a little weird.  And then it was like a very Brady Christmas and all that stuff.  Yeah, so.  But anyway, I saw nothing but happiness in that house is what I'm getting at, Anthony. 
[02:01:00]  Him and his wife.  There was another time I went there and, you know, he told me we're going to have a steak  dinner and the same thing.  You know, it was always about let's have some steaks and drink martinis and watch the sunrise.  He just, dude, he loves our radio show.  I mean, that's all he talks about with, you know, his friends and stuff.  He always had a good time when he came in.  That's for sure.  He actually had a friend come by.  Maybe too good of a time is what the problem is.  You can guess who he didn't like on the show.  I got vibes off of me.  Hated my guts.  Yeah.  Wow.  He had a friend come over that was about the same age as him.  I think Barry's about 50, 51, somewhere around there. 
[02:01:30]  And this guy was a doctor and swears that he didn't know what the Brady Bunch was when  he met Barry Williams.  Stop it.  It's impossible.  I'm like, there's actually a person out there that has no idea what the, you know, that there  was a show on called the Brady Bunch.  Was it the Dittmeyer kid from next door?  No.  He's a doctor now?  But the guy swears.  And that's why, you know, he's really good friends with Barry because he just knows Barry  is Barry and not as this, you know, celebrity, whatever that used to be on TV.  He's lying.  He is absolutely lying.  There's no one that could grow up in this country. 
[02:02:00]  He said he never watched the show growing up.  You didn't have to watch the show.  It was just part of pop culture.  You just knew Greg Brady.  Right.  It was everywhere you looked, right?  Yeah.  So, you know, there was another time I came over and the wife didn't realize I was showing  up and instead of having steak dinner, I watched him and his wife, you know, whispering  and pointing at stuff in the refrigerator.  And it turned out, it turned out.  That's an odd thing to see. 
[02:02:30]  Well, because I was there for dinner.  Yeah.  And, you know, usually there's like a maid or some help that is like.  Alice.  Yeah, we know.  Yeah.  She's in the center square.  You know, serving food and drinks and stuff, you know.  But when I arrived, obviously there was no help around.  And obviously the wife had no idea that I was coming by.  So what they were doing at the refrigerator.  Now, Greg, when you have guests over, it's always polite to have something available  for them to eat.  I'm sorry, Dad.  How about this hog?  You want to eat that? 
[02:03:00]  So what they were doing at the refrigerator was pointing out like leftovers that I was  going to have.  You're going to eat some Brady, very Brady leftovers?  So I had leftovers.  Some kind of fettuccine with like peas and a cream sauce.  What if they're the people that kind of scrape it from their plate back into the container  because they don't expect guests?  I had Barry's leftovers there, Anthony.  And then.  You know what I noticed?  And then he had just really fast because I looked at my plate of food going, I hate  this.  And he had a nice spaghetti with a nice.  Yeah, we gave you like crap. 
[02:03:30]  And his was a nice meat sauce.  And it was just smelling very fresh.  And mine was kind of crusty because it's been in the fridge a while.  How about ordering some takeout?  Yeah, some Chinese food.  But it was just really funny to see him and his wife at the refrigerator discussing, you  know.  I didn't expect this asshole to come over.  Look, I told him to come yesterday.  We watched it.  He put a scented log in.  He started a fire.  All right?  We have to have him back.  Why did you invite him over?  I didn't invite him.  He just shows up.  You know, our listeners are a bunch of asses out. 
[02:04:00]  For some reason, Opie goes to California.  He doesn't get a hotel room.  He stays with Bob Eatman.  He stays with me.  Wine 6, Fred in Texas.  Java log with Greg Brady.  Oh, no.  Line 7, Kevin and Philly.  No, I'm not going on the phones.  I'm just quickly going over them.  Line 7, Kevin and Philly.  Opie called in for a Java log because I forgot my name.  Java log.  I don't want him here.  Every time he comes, the marshmallows disappear.  I don't know what he does.  I didn't know I was married to Joaquin and Philly.  I didn't know I was married to Joaquin and Philly. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, we're going to talk about that a little later.  That's a very good segue.  Anyway, Anthony, the news out of Hollywood, and I'm very surprised because I saw just a  loving couple.  I really did.  Yeah.  I really did.  I'm really surprised when you emailed this to me.  But Barry Williams, a very Brady split.  Oh, they've got to put that in there.  Growing up, Brady apparently didn't do much for Barry Williams' love life.  Anthony, the former sitcom star who played Greg in the Blended Family series is in the  midst of his second marital breakup after wife Ella, Mary, Matt Williams filed for divorce 
[02:05:00]  on Tuesday.  This was, I guess, last Tuesday.  So the wife filed, huh?  Yeah.  What did she do for a living?  She had money too, right?  She was like a banker or something?  Like international banking.  I mean, like loaded, like a big wig in the financial world.  Now, does he have a lot of money?  Because I know back in those days, I don't think they did the residuals the way they started  probably in the late 70s, early 80s.  I mean, did he have money from that?  He obviously did real well with his career and stuff, but not like the sitcom stars of 
[02:05:30]  today.  They don't get the residuals.  So I heard that she just made a boatload of money.  Yeah.  That's what I've heard.  A big wig?  Was she as big as the wig Jan wore in that episode?  She went to the party and tried to change her personality by wearing the big wig?  I'm the new Jan Brady.  I'm the new Jan Brady.  It's my imaginary boyfriend, George Glass.  The couple married since 1999, formally separated earlier this month.  Uh-oh.  Meaning, yeah, right around the new year.  Ella Williams requested... 
[02:06:00]  This is where...  Here's the weird part.  This is where it gets a little ugly, in my opinion.  Ella Williams requested sole custody of the pair's two-year-old son and asked that Barry  Williams only be permitted to visit with a nanny present.  What does that mean?  Uh-oh.  Maybe they're afraid he'll take the kid.  Let's play...  Let's go...  What, like take and run off?  It happens.  Who the hell's not going to see Greg Brady, though? 
[02:06:30]  Where's he going to hide?  It's Greg Brady.  I'm just saying that because of the possible reason.  I mean, who knows?  I don't want to make any Woody Allen-ish accusation.  It could just be because...  Right, right.  She's afraid he'll take off or she's being a ball buster.  Well, you know, I mean, obviously something happened.  Yeah.  Concerning Barry, obviously.  Do you think that the kid knocked his prime rim over?  Pride rim?  Oh, my God.  I knew what you meant, but Jesus.  I really did.  I thought he said his prime rim.  His pride rim? 
[02:07:00]  His pride rim.  His nice chrome one he put on his van.  Wonderful.  And he knocked it over.  It went clang.  Got kicked right in the ladder.  Pride rim.  Jim from Munaki, I suck.  Pride rim.  All right, anyway.  So, it's a developing story, but...  Yeah.  She might be doing it for a little more leverage.  I honestly did not see that coming.  And I've been to his house three times easily in L.A.  I've talked to both of them on the phone a couple times.  And even Ben and I actually ran into them at... 
[02:07:30]  Oh, no, not ran into them.  We had dinner with Barry and his wife and a bunch of couples from, what, Connecticut or something?  Remember?  Yeah.  Remember those asses?  Remember?  Hold on.  Let me get your mic on.  The funniest thing was...  Hold on.  The funniest thing is coming?  Wait, wait.  Let me stand on.  What happened?  Hold on.  Andy, did you hear that?  Yes, I heard that.  He said the funniest thing.  Now, this isn't just something funny.  Yeah, this is...  This, now, what we're going to hear is the funniest thing.  Tyson, you heard that, right?  Yeah, it's the funniest thing.  You've seen some funny things, probably. 
[02:08:00]  But this will take it.  This is now funnier than any of that because it is, as he...  Let's put it, the funniest thing.  Richard Pryor live in concert?  Nothing compared to this.  Nah, stop it.  Eddie Murphy, delirious?  Nothing.  Garbage.  And you brought your laughing cap, right?  Tyson has...  It's on.  ...has put the laughing cap on, so we're now ready for...  People, I beg you, please strap in.  Pull over, folks, if you're driving, because a real laugh is coming.  This is Ben's amaterial, if I do say myself.  The funniest thing.  The funniest thing about Barry Williams and his wife and having dinner in New York that 
[02:08:30]  time, right?  Yes.  All right.  All right, Ben.  We're all prepared.  We're all ready.  We all have our smiles ready to go.  Hope's talking about the radio show to one of Barry's friends from New Cane, and he's like,  why don't you guys broadcast from another country on a boat?  Remember that?  That was funny.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's play a new game.  When I'm around, you say something stupid like that, punch in the face.  Wow.  That was funny stuff.  Terrific.  That wouldn't even be funny if Natalie Wood said it as she was falling off. 
[02:09:00]  Scott Peterson had a funnier boat story.  The Modesto Follies.  Another gem from Ben Sparks, everyone.  It's the story.  Gloop, gloop, gloop, gloop, gloop, gloop.  Of a man named Scotty.  Who was drowning two cock blockers of his own. 
[02:09:30]  All right.  There you go.  There's a fetus in one of those squares.  The Peterson.  I will say this much, though.  Walking around with Barry Williams through New York, through Midtown.  That guy is so famous everywhere.  He can't walk two feet without everybody.  That's why that guy is full of crap saying he didn't know who he was.  Stop it.  The guy can't walk without being mobbed.  We went to another place to have drinks, and I'm telling you, man, they were so happy. 
[02:10:00]  It's going to be really interesting when the story comes out, because they always do.  Women between the ages of like 30 and 50 just all wanted pictures with Barry Williams, wherever we went.  I heard rumor, rumor has it, they were in the house.  She was listening through a vent, and actually heard him propositioning a girl, and it turned out to be a goat.  Yeah.  And she was upset by that, because she thought he was cheating with a girl, and it turned out to be a goat. 
[02:10:30]  And he later asked to have the goat join in.  That's really good.  In the bedroom.  Well, wasn't there a time, though, too, that she really, really thought that he was planning a surprise party?  Yeah, yeah.  She kept running in with her arms out, and he kept going, what do you want, you annoying whore?  There's no party?  Nothing.  And then there was a time she had actually, because she's a bigwig in the banking business,  she had some important bank documents, and she asked him to bring them to the office,  and he got on his bicycle, and the tube, he found some girl that he knew, 
[02:11:00]  and left the tube in her station wagon, and drove off and lost the important documents.  And then actually gave him a second chance, and he lost it again while he was looking at magazines of hot rods.  And wasn't there also a time, like, they bought for their bedroom some sex toys,  and he couldn't put them together because she's not mechanically inclined?  I believe that was his brother.  Well, yeah, but I know she also complained she didn't like him smoking in the house  and calling her parents by their first name.  That was true, yeah.  And his alter ego, Johnny Bravo, was getting to be a bit much. 
[02:11:30]  His singing around the house.  Yeah.  All right, well.  I forgot about that.  Well, all I hear all day long is school and talk,  great Marsha is with this, or how wonderful Marsha did that.  Marsha, Marsha, Marsha.  Marsha, Marsha, Marsha.  Marsha.  Marsha.  Looking at the screen, what does this feeling mean?  I got this either way down deep in my loins.  Her blonde-haired beauty, and who ain't she a cutie? 
[02:12:00]  The best in every club that she joins.  She teases all the fellas, her little sister jealous.  Goddess from her head to her toes.  Well, she wears a groovy skirt with a flowered print shirt.  She's turning heads wherever she goes, and all the things she does to me.  I, I, I, I got my very first border watching Marsha Brady on a black and white sheet on TV. 
[02:12:30]  Marsha, Marsha, Marsha.  I got my very first border watching Marsha Brady.  On a black and white sheet on TV.  Marsha, Marsha, Marsha.  Love me, she.  Billboard Junior High, her sparkling blue eyes.  The smile anyone I'd die for. 
[02:13:00]  Well, I almost got my load at the Hawaiian episode.  But mommy started knocking on my door.  She's sweeter than a peach in her bikini on the beach.  The other girls couldn't compare.  Yeah, and what a piece of ass when she took that hula class.  Her skirt so short, I think I saw her hair.  And all the things she does to me. 
[02:13:30]  You're in love for Janity.  I, I, I, I, I got my very first border watching Marsha Brady on a black and white sheet on TV.  Marsha, Marsha, Marsha.  I, I, I, I, I, I got my very first border watching Marsha Brady on a black and white sheet on TV. 
[02:14:00]  Marsha, Marsha, Marsha.  I, I, I, I, I got my very first border watching Marsha Brady on a black and white sheet on TV.  It's the worst of the Opie and N3 show.  Ant used to pick up a little CB horse.  This is.  Come on, man.  Remember the big CB radio craze?  I was like in my early teens.  And it was a way to get girls, you know?  Yeah.  Okay. 
[02:14:30]  Um, Breaker, Breaker19.  Go ahead, good buddy.  Yeah, um, uh, Breaker for a radio check.  You're coming in four by four, good buddy.  Thank you.  And then you're sitting there like, yeah, what else can I say?  Come back.  I'm 10, 10, 10-8 on the side waiting for you, good buddy.  Meh.  Because I didn't drive, so what was the use?  You're just sitting in there. 
[02:15:00]  It can't be like, you know, I'm double nickels all the way.  Looking out for the Smokies.  Yeah.  Oh, look at that.  We got some pretty seat covers here today.  Down the old blacktop.  Keep her between the ditches.  Good buddy.  Yeah.  Well, all right.  I did that.  What else can I say?  I'm just on the CB.  Oh, I got to explain this.  This just never, explaining never works on this show, does it? 
[02:15:30]  I was living in California at the time, and I was very equestrian.  I had a horse, and I used to ride, and my handle, because I ran a rent string.  This guy I knew had a rent string, so you used to take these Marines from Camp Pendleton  that wanted to be a cowboy for the weekend.  And to guide them up in the hill.  So I was like the guide.  And I'd take them up there, and then go down, back down the hill, and get the next batch, 
[02:16:00]  and bring them up.  And so I was the wrangler with you.  Hey, good buddy.  You got the wrangler.  Good buddy.  The butt wrangler.  Ah, shut up.  What was your handle?  Diamond dust.  Diamond dust?  Fag!  That's worse than butt wrangler. 
[02:16:30]  It wasn't butt wrangler.  It was the wrangler.  Because a wrangler was a guy on a horse that got together the livestock.  Diamond dust?  I don't know.  Hey, you got the diamond dust.  Hello, diamond dust.  Butt plug, you out there?  Good buddy?  Go ahead with your little cute story.  Why?  Got your ears on? 
[02:17:00]  Here's a rubber duck.  A rubber duck, what's it?  Big fan, come on.  You shake the trees, I'll rake the leaves, good buddy.  For sure, for sure.  Oh, God.  Clean, clear the flight test.  Oh, dude.  I'm kidding.  The big pin's water.  Shut this off.  Yeah, we definitely got the front door, good buddy.  Mercy sakes alive.  We got us a convoy.  We got a convoy.  I was a kid looking for chicks.  Were you in a roller skate?  Hey, there's a chick in a roller skate. 
[02:17:30]  Uh-oh.  All right.  Hey, take her down to Double Nickels up by the interstate, good buddy.  We got a Kojak with a Kodak.  Good buddy taking pictures, giving away invitations.  I'll be back.  I got to go 10-100.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you see any Tijuana taxis out there?  We got us a Tijuana taxi. 
[02:18:00]  Whoa, I just got passed by a crazy man on a crotch rocket.  You better watch out for the Smokies.  Come on, everybody.  All right.  All right.  Meet you up at the choking tube.  All right, the Wrangler.  Well, explain the rest of your story.  So then there was this girl that I used to communicate with on the Citizens Band.  And her handle was Dreamweaver. 
[02:18:30]  You dick.  Dreamweaver.  Dreamweaver, this is the Wrangler you got your ears on.  And she sounded hot.  Yeah.  So I invited her down to ride horses.  The key, ladies and gentlemen.  She sounded hot.  What did he look like, Ant?  Oh, shut up.  All right, go ahead.  So I was all excited for my little date. 
[02:19:00]  And I saddled up my horse and the other horse.  And kind of, shut up.  Dreamweaver, I'll meet you down at the stable at 2 o'clock in the afternoon.  This is the Wrangler, over and out.  Dreamweaver.  So I'm all psyched.  You're an ass, man.  And I believe we can't.  So, all right. 
[02:19:30]  So I saddle up my horse.  And I spend time, you know, brushing the horses, making sure they look all good and everything.  And then I saddle up the other horse.  And I take the reins and put her on the saddle horn.  And I'm kind of trailering the other horse, you know.  Down to meet her by the riverbed where we were going to ride.  Well, she comes walking up.  And I see kind of in the distance.  I'm like, okay, that must be her.  All right, now, wait, wait.  Now, you did say that you had the 10 and everything and you were hoping to score in the woods, right? 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I packed like a whole thing.  Saddlebags were all packed up with a couple of beers.  And I had bedrolls and a tent just in case things went well because we had a bunch of hills to ride up in and stuff.  I'm going to camp out with my Dreamweaver.  Dreamweaver, tell your mom you're going to be spending the night, Dreamweaver.  Tell her you're at a friend's house because we're going to camp out.  This is the Wrangler.  Over and out.  I'm 10-10-10-8. 
[02:20:30]  On the side, Dreamweaver.  Looking forward to my little date.  Yeah.  Well, she comes up.  Even before I was gravely disappointed, the horse that had a carrier looked pissed.  I wasn't sure if I should take the saddle off of the horse, put it on her and let the horse ride her.  Dreamweaver.  She was huge.  Dreamweaver.  I believe you can get me. 
[02:21:00]  Dreamweaver.  All right.  Yes, I was gravely disappointed.  I believe you can get me.  I believe you can get me.  I believe you can get me.  So Dreamweaver was a big...  Are you a Wrangler?  Yes.  Please don't be Dreamweaver.  I'm Dreamweaver. 
[02:21:30]  All right.  Let's go for a ride.  So we went like up and down the riverbed for about an hour.  I was like, oh, look at the time.  Here I had like bedrolls on the back of this thing.  It was like I was Paw Ingles going up to Walnut Grove.  I was going to go over the river for a week to go get supplies for the family.  I mean, I had this thing packed out like a pack mule.  I was like a prospector.  I had crap hanging off the horses.  Oh, look at the time. 
[02:22:00]  You were ready to rock.  I was ready to rock.  I was a dreamweaver.  I had firearms.  I was going to hunt for food.  Then I realized looking at it, I'd need to beg a moose.  So, you know.  We used to hunt.  We were hunting little rabbits and stuff.  Your feet and the heart would be forget about it.  Gee, okay.  No, there's not many bison left on the plane.  I could live off your thigh for a couple of weeks.  I can't breathe.  Oh, it was horrid.  I was so disappointed because she's talking that she, you know. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, yeah.  I look like Tatum O'Neal.  Yeah, sure you do.  Great.  So, I let her, you know, I let her off and she rode off into the distance.  You didn't do the drive-by?  How are you going to do a drive-by on horseback?  Well, what, I'm the only guy with two horses, one empty?  Are you a wrangler?  No.  No, just looking for another girl.  You should have tried to, like, meet her in town or something, did the drive-by. 
[02:23:00]  The whole thing was riding up like Clint friggin' Eastwood, dude.  I understand that.  I had the whole look.  You've got to remember something.  I'm a kid.  I'm, like, maybe 13 years old.  And this was mid-70s.  I had cowboy attire on.  Believe me.  This was in San Juan Capistrano, California.  A very equestrian town.  Used to ride.  This was what we did, you know.  And I'm, like, you know, I had firearms on me. 
[02:23:30]  I swear to God, I had a pistol.  Just in case I had a fight for her honor.  For any bandoleros.  Meanwhile, they'd have been, you keep her.  We don't want her.  Maybe she could pull the wagon.  Oh, man.  But this was, like, I was so pumped up for this.  And so was she.  Pumped up.  But, yeah, it was very disappointing.  But to bring it all back to the beginning of this story, she was a girl. 
[02:24:00]  All right.  I haven't laughed that hard in a while.  My eyes are teared.  This song brings back memories every time I hear it.  I got to tell you, to this day, when I hear Dreamweaver, I think of the whole day, how happy I was and psyched and how disappointed I was riding back to the ranch that day.  Oh, that's funny.  All right.  Very good story.  Thank you.  Hi, this is Chris Griffin, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony, just like me.  I like bad stuff in my mouth. 
[02:24:30]  Your mom's box.  Hey, Steve.  What's going on, man?  How do you know?  There he is.  There you go.  I'm not seeing as much flame wear.  Only on this one little side.  Yeah, I know.  One side of his hat is flaming.  Trimmed it down.  Trimmed it down.  You have to take these things in moderation.  That just seems like the pilot light.  Really?  He hasn't lit himself up yet.  But he's got a pilot light that's always on.  Yeah.  Actually, I think they're all in the wash.  Is that it? 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  I've got six or seven flame shirts in the wash right now, so you've got to rotate them.  Sizzling.  Are you excited about Friday?  Are you going to have more food coming down here?  I hope so.  I hope so.  We have a lot of people coming, hopefully, from out of state, too.  We've got a lot of...  Well, we're talking about the eggnog drinking contest.  Oh, yeah.  It happened on Friday.  You know what?  We have to just tell folks, because people are getting a little scared.  We're not going to have Stalker Patty's pubes in the eggnog.  Yeah, don't worry.  Come down.  Just come down.  Yeah, that's actually been getting emailed in a lot. 
[02:25:30]  That was more for us to just kind of have some wacky fun with everybody.  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  So don't worry about the Stalker Patty toenails or the pubes, okay?  It's just going to be eggnog.  It's just going to be an eggnog drinking contest.  Last man standing will win a MiFi, the Portable XM Satellite Radio.  That's the hottest Christmas gift this season, okay?  Yep.  And Steve, once again, is requesting, if you come down here on Friday, to bring food.  Yeah, that's...  Bring food for Steve and toilet paper for Ben.  Right.  Exactly. 
[02:26:00]  Because for some reason, that's a way to tell who's getting in.  It was when we had a whole bunch of people.  I don't know what Steve's whole logic to that was.  One place has been reserved for the person that comes to furthest.  Yeah, we had actually a guy email last night from Arizona.  Wow.  He said he'd be willing to make the trip.  Really?  Yeah.  He's just going to start driving now?  He's taking a plane.  Mike Tyson.  Where do you go fly?  Yeah, he's taking a plane.  They kind of got that stuff down, though.  Oh, yeah.  That flying thing.  Why don't we...  Why are we always taking trains and cars and... 
[02:26:30]  Because we're cheap?  We drove to Cleveland.  XM is cheap.  Who drives to Cleveland from New York?  We do, evidently.  Yeah, you guys.  I was doing a little vehicle shakedown for the Cleveland drive.  I was going to fly.  Yeah.  And then I just got a new vehicle.  I was like, I want to check out the navigation system, see if it knows where Cleveland is.  There you go.  Wasn't that when XM couldn't get the flight information, got a little screwed up?  That was another thing.  I was kind of forced into it.  Kind of like the Vegas trip that's coming up.  You don't hear about the flights until it's 5 in the morning, you get a call. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, that's right.  You've got to be at the plane.  Oh, what?  Wow.  All right, so the MiFi thing is happening Friday.  People just show up at the station before the show, and then you guys will kind of pick  who comes up.  Well, we're going to try to streamline it as much as possible, but we're going to have  extra help.  I think Kenny's going to be here helping out, because the requests are flooding, and we've  got another few hundred people asking if they can drink a whole gallon of eggnog for  a MiFi.  You think they could drink a gallon?  People are claiming that they can drink a gallon.  There's two ways to get out of this contest. 
[02:27:30]  Either you have to take a leak.  If you leave the studio to take a leak, you're out.  Or if you puke.  Or if you puke.  I think it's going to be the puking that it's going to be.  I think a lot of people are going to barf.  I really do.  I've seen this before.  It doesn't work well.  And what are we doing?  It's a double shot of eggnog every minute?  Right.  Double shot every minute.  Is that not going to last 20 minutes?  No.  You've got to stretch it out a little bit.  Double shot every two minutes?  No, it's got to be every minute.  Will they be out because 20 double shots of eggnog are going to puke? 
[02:28:00]  Got to see who's going to be the champ.  We've got some 300 pounders that are emailing in saying it's a pussy challenge.  I don't know.  Plus the fact, you know, with the brand new Opie and Anthony show, we're trying to like  not stretch our bits all day because we actually have material to do.  We're going to do it all day.  Right.  So maybe it's a quick little half hour, 40 minute contest when it's all said and done.  Right?  Right.  All right.  If they last longer, they last longer.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  So that's happening.  And Steve, we were just saying, and I know you're in the other room, there's going to  be an assault on the media, greatest hits on opianathlete.com? 
[02:28:30]  Working on it.  Working on it.  I'll have them up throughout the day.  But the real reason you're in here.  Oh, yes.  Martini, Steve.  Oh.  Anthony came out of retirement.  Yes, I did.  Want to explain it?  I've gotten soft over the years, Opie.  You know, what got me into radio in the first place was writing the O.J. Simpson song  parody, wrote the Gun Electric Shock O.J.  Are you going to be writing a follow-up Gun Electric Shock Scott Peterson?  Scott Peterson?  No. 
[02:29:00]  But I, you know, I haven't written a song parody in a while.  And I was so inspired, Steve.  So inspired by Steve and his flaming clothing that I had to go back to write another parody.  It's touching.  It really is.  I collaborated with my brother, brother Joe, who did the music.  And we put it together.  Yeah.  I'm very touched.  Thank you, Steve.  I heard it before, and it's impressive.  And the fact that Joe was able to put all that work into putting the music together, 
[02:29:30]  and you actually sang the track.  I mean, that's it.  What an honor.  Hold on.  We've got to take one step backwards real fast.  Jason in New Hampshire.  What's up, Jason?  What's up, guys?  Hey, real fast.  What do you got?  Hey, you know, you've got to revise your rules a little bit.  Why?  You said if you've got to leave the studio to piss, you're out.  Well, you know somebody's going to piss in a trash can, and Norton's going to be pulling  on himself.  Well, what if they're wearing diapers?  Hmm.  Do we check them for diapers?  We've got to check everyone for diapers.  If you wear diapers, you've earned the right to stand there and urinate on yourself. 
[02:30:00]  You know, I almost agree with you, Jimmy.  But you've got to at least tell us that you're wearing diapers so we can mock you.  You can pee your pants if you wear diapers.  Oh, this place is going to stink.  You know what?  Yeah, if you take a leak in studio, out of studio, you're out.  If you leak, you're out.  Okay.  No leaks.  All right, so back to the song that Anthony made for Martini Steve.  Yeah.  Ready to play this thing?  Sure.  All right, check it out.  It's the Martini Steve song.  Martini Steve song. 
[02:30:30]  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire.  The only buyer's blaming attire. 
[02:31:00]  His clothing's like a barbecue.  His laundry never needs a dryer.  If you're selling burning shoes,  this drunken Lebanese will fire.  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire.  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire.  The only buyer's blaming attire. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  You know he's got some flaming shoes.  The kind that Satan would desire.  If you're with him drinking boots,  the smoke detector is required.  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire.  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire.  He only buys flaming attire.  He only buys flaming attire. 
[02:32:00]  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire.  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire.  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire.  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire.  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire.  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire.  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire.  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire.  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire.  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire.  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire.  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire.  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire.  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire.  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire.  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire.  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire.  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire.  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire.  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire.  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire.  And Foundry Music.  Oh, yeah, exactly.  All that stuff.  A little Foundry Music. 
[02:32:30]  I appreciate that.  No problem.  That's really touching, man.  That's great.  I'm a little disappointed you're not wearing more flames today, though.  I'll make up for it tomorrow.  I will have flaming boots, flaming shirt, flaming hat.  People can't see your face.  When he's hearing that song, he looks like one of the girls that Johnny Fontaine was singing to.  Yeah, you were just...  Well, that's also partially because one of my eyes is tearing up because I clocked myself in the head yesterday.  But other than that...  With what? 
[02:33:00]  A cardboard box.  I know.  Stupid.  He's trying to put himself out.  He hit himself.  You've got to give props to your brother there.  Oh, yeah.  That's great.  Joe's the music guy.  I guess he just shows up at your house with all the equipment.  He's hysterical.  He shows up yesterday.  He's got his truck, and he just comes into my house with a little mixing board and microphones and sets up.  We blow it out, and then he leaves.  And I'm like, you're like a doctor making a house call, you know?  Parody done.  You'll get my bill. 
[02:33:30]  Just burns it right there in the house.  Burns it.  Hands you the disc.  Here you go.  This was a piece of cake.  Thank you.  It's good to get back into making a little song parody.  All right.  And to do it to Steve, one of our favorites.  Thank you, Anthony.  We found your music wear today.  Yeah, well, they're easy because I have so many of these effing shirts.  What a lousy, stupid idea this was.  What?  What?  Never make 150 shirts, though.  You're not sure that people would buy 10 of them.  Why?  People don't buy them with the FM on it?  That's fantastic. 
[02:34:00]  I love the logo.  Actually, they would if we could figure out how to sell them easier.  I just got lazy and decided I didn't like mailing these effing things out.  So we're working on it.  How many have you sold?  Actually, we did sell them.  We probably sold like 200 of them so far.  Out of 150?  I know.  I probably have 150 left out of like 400.  All right.  No one cares.  Anyways, thank you.  No one cares.  Thank you, Anthony, for dragging me through that.  There he goes.  Martini Steve, everyone.  All I want is to get laid and eat sandwiches. 
[02:34:30]  That's it.  That's the closest reference you can get to something cool, hip, and groovy.  Cool how?  Hip and groovy.  Great.  Ha, ha, ha.  Dick.  Yeah.  Where do you go when your wife changes a lot?  See, I'll be at everybody's show.  I want to be on you.  Well, you've come to the right place.  I help you.  You help me.  We all laugh.  Don't worry.  We're not listening because this is a boring conversation.  Love you too, sweetness.  If you walk past them, they'll only take your jewelry, take your purse, or whatever, you know.  You have no idea what they are.  There are a lot of questions about them.  Real.  Dirty looking.  Pinky mouth.  Shut up.  Bring on the booze. 
[02:35:00]  This is the O.B. and Anthony show?  Okay.  It's the worst.  The end, Anthony.  I like my penis.  Oh, no, no.  Fred no more.  Just a killer pieces.  You prepare for war.  Slow me in.  Settle the score.  Trust me again with the words that you will evermore. 
[02:35:30]  Gotta love Metallica.  God damn.  Never gets old, right, Anthony?  No.  This is drive-like 90-mile-an-hour music.  Oh, yeah.  Love it.  I think it's time for the eggnog drinking contest on the O.B. and Anthony program.  Steve is in place with his video camera, filming it for opiananthony.com and foundrymusic.com.  Oh, I hate these type of things. 
[02:36:00]  I kind of get giddy.  I like these things.  Look at all the eggnog is out.  Many cups lined up.  Yes, our ten contestants.  My brother Darren's going to be one of the official pourers.  Now, mathematically, this is a little rough because if these guys are doing shots every  minute and there's ten guys, do a little quick math.  That would be six seconds per cup.  Six seconds to pour out each cup so that everyone's ready for the next shot. 
[02:36:30]  I'm up for the challenge.  You're up for the challenge.  Yes, absolutely.  It's a challenge within a challenge, O.B.  Do we have enough eggnog opened up?  I think this is going to be just a clusterfuck.  I mean, I have confidence in our guys, but I don't know.  I think something's going to go horribly wrong here, Anthony.  They're dirty animals.  I think it's probably closer to five seconds per pour because you're going to need a little  bit of time for them to then pick it up and do the shot.  Yes.  You know, the in-between time.  This sounds like the Warren Commission, you know, with the shots.  I need to reload the cartridge before I pour again. 
[02:37:00]  He can't possibly reload those cups quick enough.  You have me consorting with a real cast of beverages.  All right.  It looks like they've got a system in place.  All right.  We'll see if it works out.  Noah's helping out.  It's his birthday today.  Oh.  Happy birthday, Noah.  Happy birthday.  Will you be banging a porn star for your birthday today?  Next month, hopefully.  Next month, hopefully.  We're getting in on the books.  She'll be back.  Did she call you or text you with a happy birthday message?  No, not yet.  She knows, though.  We talked last night, so she's good to go.  Oh, you talked last night. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, we did.  You guys really have something going.  No, not really.  I think we kindled a little something.  Yeah, you do.  Yeah, you do.  You anxiously wait for a phone call.  It's kind of a relationship.  You know when you're next seeing each other.  You call and talk to each other or text each other.  Technically, it's a relationship.  It's really low maintenance.  That's for sure.  I've got to give you that one.  Do you have a girlfriend?  No.  You don't have a steady?  No.  Well, that wouldn't last very long at this point.  No?  No.  No, because he's banging a porn star on the side.  What girlfriend's going to put up with that?  That is kind of tough to tell your girlfriend. 
[02:38:00]  A really good one.  A really good one.  There's a few of them out there that would.  Would.  I guess.  I don't know.  Congrats.  All right.  Thank you.  And then we've got Nathaniel in between doing stand-up.  He's now an official pourer in the eggnog drinking contest.  Well, we all have dreams, Opie.  All right.  I guess we're ready for the contestants.  Oh, boy.  I just had a cup.  I could probably do five shots.  Really?  Really?  Is it thick and creamy and noggy?  Yeah, but it has a watery undertone to it.  It's thick with a watery undertone. 
[02:38:30]  You know what?  It's like drinking a blood clot.  Listen.  Oh, listen.  You're good.  But Anthony is brilliant when it comes to describing what contestants have to direct.  You did such a great job with the chowder eating contest.  The chowder was easy to describe.  The eggnog is a little harder, but it is, I don't know, a creamy mix.  There you go.  Just thick and creamy with a heavy flavor of vanilla.  Lukewarm.  Lukewarm.  And unfortunately, the cups are a little too tall to fill it up to the tippity top. 
[02:39:00]  But it's up to the tippity top of the line.  Of the line.  Pushing a little over the line.  And you just have to swig it down.  Perhaps it backs up a little in your esophagus where you can't get it down quite fast enough.  You've got to give it an extra swallow.  You've got to wish you had maybe a little piece of bread to kind of tamp it down.  And then before you know it, oh, the next shot, ready to go.  Thick and creamy like the first.  Filled right up to the tippy top of that line. 
[02:39:30]  And down she goes for another one.  Gulp.  And oh, before it even reaches your stomach.  Before you feel that gentle caress.  Yes.  Of thick nog lining your stomach walls.  Bam!  It's time for another.  And the cup is full in front of you.  And just like the first two, you belt it down.  And thick and hearty.  And creamy as it is.  And getting warmer and warmer.  It works its way down. 
[02:40:00]  Just a little warmer than the last shot.  And you just know shot after shot after shot is going to get a little warmer and warmer and warmer.  And the ones at the edge next to Steve's shirt are going to be bubbling, piping hot, dare I say.  So good luck to all our contestants washing this mix down.  That's how you describe it, Morgan.  Wonderful.  He's the pro.  It's hilarious.  All right, let's get the contestants in here.  We've stalled enough. 
[02:40:30]  Bringing them in.  Ten of them, huh?  You're going to have room for all these guys?  Ten contestants.  Selfie, savage.  We've had to remove.  I want to let everyone know that knows the description of the studio.  We've had to remove the lesbian couch.  That space is now replaced with lined garbage pails.  It looks like my bathroom floor.  Yeah, there's plastic on the floor.  And there's garbage pails.  There's garbage pails where the lesbian couch usually is. 
[02:41:00]  And, guys, I cannot emphasize enough that those pails are there.  They are to be used just in case that creamy, thick mix of egg and nog starts working its  way back up.  You can turn around, grab a pail, and go to town.  All right.  Well, why don't we meet our contestants, Anthony?  Let's meet our contestants.  And don't forget we've got five other contestants from all over the country that are playing as  well.  Right.  They guessed how many shots the last guy's going to do without puking. 
[02:41:30]  We'll see who's right, and they will see but my five as well.  Who do we got?  How you doing, guys?  I'm Dice.  Hey, Dice.  What's up?  I brought you those shirts.  I brought some DVDs this time around.  I just got to say, that shit dick song fucked me up.  Yeah, you like the shit dick?  I was banging a chick in the ass on Wednesday night.  I finish, and I'm humming shit dick the whole time.  It's not the best thing you want to do.  The chick I'm banging likes a shit dick.  We'll play that again for you.  Thank you.  All right, as soon as you puke, we'll play that for you.  Works for me.  Where are you from, Dice?  Long Island. 
[02:42:00]  Long Island, right on.  Of course.  We met Pat.  Pat.  Hi.  From earlier.  I really should be working to pay off those tickets.  Yeah, he did our last contest.  It cost him like $900.  Yeah.  Because he decided you could just, yeah, park your van in the middle of 57th Street in New  York City.  He had a suspended license.  He got arrested for it.  He even stands like a psychopath.  With the hands straight down, not moving.  How much away, Pat?  $350.  $350.  He's got to be one of the favorites.  I'm thinking the fatter guys are the favorites today. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah, this would be my forte.  Forte.  All right.  Thanks.  And Pat, where are you from again?  Munaki, New Jersey.  That's right.  Munaki, New Jersey.  And then we got Matt.  What's up, Matt?  What's going on?  Where are you from, bro?  Jersey.  More Jersey guys.  Jersey just supporting the show.  Jersey represent.  Wow, big time.  Any shout outs?  Anything you want to say before the contest begins?  Just if you've got a Dodge truck.  I like to work on it.  Check out RamChargerCentral.com.  It's a good message board.  Yeah, I'm plugging my website here. 
[02:43:00]  What the hell, man?  Fine.  You should get at least five hits from that today.  You belong to a truck message board?  Yeah.  Do you put in parentheses, sound of air horn?  That's quite exciting.  Driveshaft, LOL.  Do they have names like that?  No.  It's like Hemi.  I'm Hemi 102.  Hey, hi.  How you doing?  Hey, whatever. 
[02:43:30]  It's just a place to go if you need help with your truck.  Oh, you sound a little taller in email.  All right.  All right, let's move on to Joe.  Joe, where are you from?  From Queens.  Queens.  Nice.  Representing Queens.  No, I can't compete with truck driving message boards.  So right now I'm thinking this is probably the worst idea I've done this morning.  How many shots do you think you could do?  The guys are starting to look at the eggnog.  Yeah, you know what? 
[02:44:00]  You can see them.  I don't even think it's the color.  It's this.  Oh.  I'm going to try to do 20, and then I might have to punch out.  To be honest with the color, it's like old jizz yellow.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a hepatitis load.  Hey, how do you feel about Pedro joining your Mets there in Queens?  See, I'm a Yankee fan, so you know what?  I'm glad we got Randy last night.  Did they really?  Well, they've still got to work on some deal through the Dodgers.  Eric Duncan, something like three minor leaguers. 
[02:44:30]  Vasquez goes to L.A.  The fucking Yankees.  Can they stop giving up young talent for 50-year-old pitchers?  Cocksucker Steinbrenner.  That really annoys me.  Thanks.  Young talent?  There you go, Joe.  Thank you, Joe.  Who else?  Joe from Queens.  Do it again.  BJ.  We know BJ.  He's been around the block a few times.  Where are you from, BJ, again?  Oakdale.  Oakdale, Long Island representing Anthony.  Anything you want to say today, BJ?  I want to say hi to Big Dave and Thundar out in Oakdale. 
[02:45:00]  And everybody in whackbag.com.  And I'll plug Hugbox.net.  You know, free girl porn site.  Hugbox.  You ever do any drinking down at the wharf down there?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, you used to go down there a lot when we had a boat.  This is a shithole.  I know.  It's a real shithole.  But it's a great place to go if you have a boat real close.  Yeah.  You do some drinking.  You go out on the boat.  You drink.  You come back.  Maybe slam some guy from Pennsylvania in the back of the head.  Come back.  Drink more.  It's a lot of fun. 
[02:45:30]  Then you go on N.E.W. and do a radio show.  Baby.  Fabulous.  BJ.  All right, BJ.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bang the girls from the college over there, do you?  What college is there?  Dowling?  Dowling.  No, I don't talk to anybody in Dowling.  Nothing good there at Dowling?  No, there's a bunch of black people and Chinese people.  Black people and Chinese people?  Yeah, we don't talk to them much, no.  Good boy.  If they're not stealing, they're staring blank with no expression on their face.  Got a little boat sale.  Thank you, BJ. 
[02:46:00]  All right.  You're welcome.  Hey, John, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Where are you from, bud?  I'm from Connecticut.  Connecticut representing.  Yeah.  And what do you want to say today?  I don't much want to say hello to the guys at opanthony.net.  I'm on there as grizzly.  I also thank my sister for coming down.  Moral support today.  She's out.  I thought she was going to be in the contest.  We were hoping one of these girls were going to be in the contest today.  Well, she really doesn't like eggnog.  Who does, though?  I know.  I do.  Yeah.  Oh, we were going to have little bite-sized fruit cakes here.  Oh, right.  We forgot about that.  A little awful fruit cakes.  I see it's Land O'Lakes eggnog. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  The same company that makes the butter.  So it's all creamy, buttery, I'm sure, also.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm ready.  And you guys, make sure you don't puke on us, please.  You guys all look around and see where the garbage pails are.  We should have made the meat.  Do our best.  Eggnog and some sort of meat.  Some sort of meat?  A little cube of meat.  Like pork?  Yeah.  Okay.  Joe Rogan giving out 50 grand.  No, thanks.  All right.  Let's move on to Steve over there, who's wearing one of my brother's fine T-shirts, I noticed. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, cool.  Turn around this month.  Got a sign on the back by the artist today.  All right on.  Yeah.  Wow.  Look at that.  My brother's What's-In-Your-Pants T-shirts.  Fine T-shirts.  Very cool.  Not much to say.  From Brooklyn.  All right.  You can email Dr...  Dr. Duckhasm.  Dr. Duckhasm?  Yeah.  Dr. D-U-K at AOL.com if you want one of these fine,  Opie and Anthony, What's-In-Your-Pants T-shirts?  Shameless plug.  Shameless plug.  Speaking of shameless plugs, eatable.com.  Thank you, mister.  Look at you, Steve.  Anything else you want to say?  Downtown, December 23rd, next Thursday. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, by the way, Nathaniel will also be performing there with me.  Our intern will be doing some...  Yeah.  Norton at the downtown.  Throwing the kid a bone.  No, he's funny.  Who's breathing like Darth Vader?  Is that you?  Yeah.  What's wrong, Steve?  Wow.  Well, it's just a little hot in here.  I thought we were on the Death Star.  It's really hot in here.  It's hot so you have emphysema.  It really is hot in here, which is going to make this contest even worse.  Oh, even better.  Oh, man, the eggnog is starting to boil a little bit.  Oh, by the second, it's just getting hotter and hotter.  It's starting to get a little clumpy, I notice, Anthony. 
[02:48:00]  Oh.  All right, Ellis, we talked.  He had his stomach done, so he's just not going to last.  Who is he kidding?  I'd like to dedicate winning this my fight to my surgeon,  who helped me lose 140 pounds.  All right.  There you go.  All right.  If I don't pass out first.  Okay.  And then, finally, Doug.  We talked to Doug earlier, too.  He's from Arizona.  He flew in just for the contest, Anthony.  Dedication.  Anything you want to say, Doug?  Go Sun Devils in the Sun Bowl.  Fuck Purdue.  Fuck Purdue.  All right.  There you go.  All right, Doug. 
[02:48:30]  Fuck a chicken.  All right.  I think we're ready.  Do you want to give the rules, Anthony?  They're pretty simple, I guess.  The rules are simple.  All our contestants will do one of these glasses full of creamy eggnog every minute.  Every minute.  If you puke, out and see.  If you have to take a leak, whether it's in your pants or you actually leave and go to the bathroom,  oot.  You're oot.  The last guy left that has not puked or pissed himself is the winner of the MiFi. 
[02:49:00]  That is how we play the game.  You all understand?  Very good.  You guys all know what cup you're going for?  I guess the cups are numbered, Dan?  Yeah, we will not be doing a Le Mans start where they run to their cups.  And you guys all know where the garbage pails are, right?  Sadly, right behind me.  Yes, please.  More important than an exit in a building on fire, please take note. 
[02:49:30]  Delegate the cups.  Just pick up whichever cup you want.  You're going to have to hold it the whole time.  Wait, one question.  Do we have to kind of like slam them or can we take the whole minute to drink?  You have a minute.  Whatever you want.  You will have a whole minute.  You can strategically use that minute however you want if you want to do it slow.  But then just remember, the next one's right around the corner.  Some guys that want to chug it can then use the rest of the minute to relax and maybe get that down.  Guys, here's the deal, too.  We've got two sets of cups here because they're pouring as you're drinking.  All right?  So just try to go for the... 
[02:50:00]  Well, whatever.  Just grab one.  Can I make a holiday toast for the first shot?  Sure, Kenny.  All right, Kenny.  Good one, Kenny.  Let's everyone raise their glass to our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  And Jim.  Because, and of course, little Jim, who I love dear.  Now, don't drink until you hear the bell because we want it on one of the second hand on the 12.  We're going to go right at the 12, Kenny.  So go.  Go with your toast.  You've got five seconds.  And Opie and Anthony, this would not be made possible.  So here we go. 
[02:50:30]  Cheers.  And there's the first one.  The contest has begun, Anthony.  It has begun.  Every time that second hand sweeps to the 12.  All right.  No, you don't have to drink it right away.  Yeah, hold your...  You should hold the glasses.  Oh, they're just going to be doing it.  Hold on.  No, no.  Yeah, but then we won't be able to keep trying.  It's got to be every minute.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Every minute, guys.  Every minute.  Every minute.  They're already wrecking the contest.  Just a minute.  You can't start chugging them all down.  I like that enthusiasm, though.  I like that, too.  All right.  Everyone did their first shot of eggnog, right?  What did it taste like? 
[02:51:00]  And that guy...  It tasted like the squid bucket from Bob Murphy.  And that guy...  Fill up Steve's cup.  He's screwed up.  He's officially on the clock for drinking only one eggnog.  Right.  He decided to get cocky, Anthony, and do two right away.  Opie, if this comes down to one eggnog and he's in it, and it worked out that that extra  shot he did, puts him over the top, I'm sure we'll have a disappointed lad.  All right.  Are the...  The cups are all filled?  Wow.  And look how quickly this comes about.  Wow.  That is quick.  All right.  Two.  One. 
[02:51:30]  And here goes the second round.  Second round.  Eggnog.  Goes down as easy as the first.  I see BJ's taking that slower drinking of the eggnog.  Doug from Arizona is having a little problem there.  I see it in his face.  What's going on, Doug?  Strategy.  Do we have a mic over there?  I'm six.  Strategy.  Strategy.  Slow and steady wins the race.  Slow and steady wins the race.  All right.  So, Anthony, everyone finish their second?  Everyone finish their second.  John automatically grabbed his third, and he's holding it there. 
[02:52:00]  Eager beaver.  Ellis, what's going on with that little stomach of yours?  No problem.  Not a problem at all.  I'm feeling good.  He's got a nog mustache going.  All right.  Looks like he just got a ride from an older gentleman.  Jesus.  All right, Anthony, we're getting close to the third round.  Everyone's got their eggnog in their hands, waiting for the start of the third round here.  Amazing how quickly that minute goes by, isn't it?  Wow.  There they go.  Too quick, right?  It's here already.  I'm thinking after five or so, you're going to start seeing a bit of a change. 
[02:52:30]  There goes the third round.  People's attitudes.  I'm looking around the room.  Dice is doing okay in the corner there.  Joe is the first to finish there.  Taste animal.  BJ's, everyone's down.  How's everyone feeling?  Still confident?  Still confident.  Wow.  It's starting to weigh me down.  Yeah, Joe, what's going on?  It's starting to weigh Joe down a little bit.  What?  What's going on, Joe?  You don't look too good already.  Yeah, I said it's starting to weigh me down like Connor and Lacey.  All right.  Uh-oh.  Ben, anything else?  Any other observations? 
[02:53:00]  All right, Anthony, the third round is done by everybody.  We're filling up the cups for the fourth round.  Is anyone starting to think, wow, I might not be able to do this after just three?  No.  Anyone?  No?  How about you, Steve?  You're on your ninth.  I'm fine.  Good to go.  Good to go?  Good to go, Jim.  All right.  Any trash talking?  Nothing?  You guys are?  I think Dice over there is starting to puss out, man.  Oh, wow.  No.  I got moved over by the Birdman.  I was fine on the other side of Pat.  All right.  Here we go.  If I got a puke, I can climb over him. 
[02:53:30]  Hit the bell for the fourth round.  Here we go.  This is the fourth double shot of eggnog.  It does come around quickly.  Oh, it sure does.  All right.  Joe slammed his cup down.  Thank you.  There they go.  Doug from Arizona.  Pat, how are you holding up over there?  The big guy, Pat?  Tastes like pancake batter.  Tastes like pancake batter.  Warm pancake batter, Anthony.  And why would you know what pancake batter tastes like?  Ooh.  Ooh, a little trash.  I like it.  All right.  Nice punch in the stomach after a bunch of eggnog. 
[02:54:00]  I know what's in my pan.  A good horse foot to the stomach.  Another carton done.  Ellis, you were a little slow there.  You all right?  I'm just pacing myself.  The pace?  He's the guy with the small stomach.  Yeah.  He's not going to last too much longer.  I got a minute to drink this thing, you said.  Yeah, you're right.  Hold on.  We're getting ready for the fifth shot.  Wait for the bell.  Wow.  Go ahead, Raisin.  We've already got four double shots in him, Anthony.  How could that little stomach hold that?  It won't.  It really won't.  Yeah.  We're coming around again.  Another minute is complete. 
[02:54:30]  And there you go.  This is the fifth double shot of eggnog.  There you go, Bob.  Let's look and see.  It's not going down as fast with a couple of people.  Joe's got...  I don't know.  Your eyes are tearing a little bit or something's going on there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's got a little redder in the face, a little hotter in here.  Anyone else have something to say?  Just raise your hand and Eric will give you the mic.  Ellis is sipping it like it's a Manhattan.  Ellis has a minute.  Ellis is the one with the small stomach.  I got a minute, man.  I got another 30 seconds before I got to finish this one.  Yes, you do.  Then the next one will start immediately.  Anybody else? 
[02:55:00]  Anyone else?  When did a small stomach become equal to you to a pussy, exactly?  You were talking shit outside.  Like, ooh, I can do this.  I wasn't the one out there blowing a midget to stay warm.  Ooh.  Oh, wow.  Hey, wow.  I don't know what that means, but whatever it is.  Ellis just finished.  I'll leave it on that one.  I got nothing.  All right, Ellis.  15 seconds left.  All right, Ellis finishes up.  Five shots done already, right?  Five shots we're on?  Yeah, somebody's got to keep tabs on this.  This is the sixth round coming up in about five seconds.  Shot number six.  I think they're going to get to the ten easily, and then it's going to get interesting, Anthony.  Yeah. 
[02:55:30]  Get ready.  There we go, guys.  Sixth round of eggnog.  Eggnog, good news.  And Joe is the one who's finishing consistently first.  Animal.  Got to get him down quick and then rest for 40 seconds, I guess.  That would seem to be the good strategy.  I think the guys that are nursing it for the whole minute, a little more pressures on these guys.  Has everyone finished?  Even Ellis slammed that one.  Okay.  Anyone feeling anything?  Stepping up.  I'm feeling good, man.  I'm good.  Everyone's good so far.  It's coming out of Ellis' nose and ears now, though. 
[02:56:00]  That could be a problem.  Yeah, Ellis is leaking eggnog a little bit.  Uh-oh.  All right, they're filling up the cups, Anthony.  The seventh round is on its way.  Damn.  Pat, how are you?  One pussy coming.  All of a sudden, you're slamming them with the rest of us now.  Hey, what do you want me to say, man?  Ooh.  How about I drink yours, too?  I don't think I'm going to be able to handle it.  I don't know.  Side wager?  Dice and Ellis are going at it, Anthony.  There's a problem there between these two.  All right, on the bell, guys.  The seventh round of eggnog will begin. 
[02:56:30]  There's another minute gone.  Jesus, a minute goes quick.  I'm looking around the room.  And another round.  Pat is done.  Dice is done.  Matt's done.  Joe's done.  BJ's done.  John's done.  Steve's done.  No, Steve's still sipping.  Okay, now Steve's done.  Ellis is done.  And Doug.  Doug, how are you feeling from Arizona?  Fantastic.  You?  I don't have to drink this crap.  I'm doing all right.  It's not affecting them yet.  No.  You think it's going to be a little higher than we anticipated, Opie?  I don't know.  No.  Or you think it'll kick in?  No, BJ's already shaking his head. 
[02:57:00]  No way.  Or you think it's going to kick in, like, quickly, where it's going to turn around?  That's not going to hit you.  Absolutely.  BJ is the smallest contestant.  I think he's in risk of getting out very early in the competition.  Smallest contestant in this batch doesn't mean you're small either.  Believe me.  If I'm the first one out before Ellis, that really sucks.  You don't want to lose to Ellis.  I'm kind of scared.  I'm beginning to smell like a puke smell coming from this dude right here.  Remember the little chick that always wins the Nathan Hochdall contest?  Yeah.  True.  So, you know, all right, thank you, Club Soda County. 
[02:57:30]  It's brilliant, as always.  Here it is.  Here comes the eighth round, Anthony.  Eighth round.  This is eight double shots of eggnog.  Most of the guys having no problem still.  Joe making a lot of faces, though.  Dude, it was like a chunk of I don't know what in that one.  Well, the eggnog's getting clumpier.  It's been warming up all morning.  Yeah.  Now, eight of these two-ounce shots would make it 16 ounces.  That's right.  Anyone feeling anything they want to talk about?  Anyone?  Anyone? 
[02:58:00]  Anyone?  You guys all good still?  There's another carton gone.  You all right?  Did anybody get the stalker patty pubes?  No, that was a toenail.  No one's having any problems.  Joe, you look like you're having problems.  No, no, I'm good.  I'm good.  Maybe it's strategy.  Maybe he's playing possum, Anthony.  Playing possum.  It's like poker.  That's true.  All right.  He could lay back, make people think he's injured.  Ellis, you all right?  Good, man.  With the small stomach?  Okay.  I cannot possibly see how he's doing that.  All right, here we go.  We're just coming back around, and there it is. 
[02:58:30]  And we're up to the ninth round of eggnog.  I'm trying to get a line on how they're feeling by the way they drink these down.  Yeah.  Steve's taking his slow approach or slower approach.  Ellis kind of having a little more trouble washing this one down?  No?  No, just the taste.  He's making a little...  Just the taste is kind of snotty.  Well, maybe not the taste, the consistency.  It's kind of like a viscous, you know?  Yes, very thick.  Smooth.  Very thick and viscous.  Yeah.  Like grease and oil.  Yeah. 
[02:59:00]  All right.  Ellis is the only one...  Oh, Ellis and Steve.  They're starting to slow down a little bit.  Yep.  Steve, you all right?  I'm all right.  I'm fine.  All right.  Steve finished up his knife.  He's fine.  And the cups get refilled.  Double shot of eggnog.  Ellis, you're done?  I'm done.  Okay, Ellis is done, too.  These guys are all East Coast drunks.  You're not going to get anybody puking on 10.  It's going to be a little while before...  Yeah, but it's a lot different than being out drinking some real fun booze.  This is thick, creamy, nauseating...  Heavy.  Heavy.  Did I say thick?  Yes, you did.  And creamy. 
[02:59:30]  There it is.  Number 10.  Here goes number 10.  We thought we'd be seeing a reaction by 10.  Looking around the room, Anthony.  Pat's done.  Dice is done.  Matt's done.  Joe's done.  Wow.  BJ's slowing down a little bit, but he just completed.  John.  Ellis.  And, of course, Steve and Ellis taking their time once again.  Steve taking their time.  And Doug from Arizona having no problem so far.  Ellis is starting to swish it around in his mouth, like, hold it in his mouth a little  bit.  That's not a good sign.  I think I found my talent.  Yeah.  What's that?  What's that?  What's that?  What's that?  Well, there's a resume stuffer.  That's a good one.  Pat's definitely the one to beat right here. 
[03:00:00]  He has the eye of the tiger.  Yeah, definitely.  He's enjoying it.  It's like the eye of the tiger and the stomach of a rhinos.  Do I mention my diabetes?  I mention my...  What an ass.  And, John, I saw you shaking your head like you were shaking off a punch after that last  cup.  I was just letting it all just drip down the gullet a little bit.  You ever see a boxer get hit and he kind of goes, you know, shoots it off?  I saw him doing that.  Yeah, it's getting a little more interesting.  A little bit.  I think we're going to get to 20, no problem, and then it's going to just get any.  It won't be no problem. 
[03:00:30]  We're on 10 now.  There it is.  This is the 11th round, Anthony.  That's all the eggnog we got?  John looks like Brother Joe with Down Syndrome.  Are we going to run out of eggnog?  If we're going to run out of eggnog, someone better go get some now.  Like pronto.  That would ruin the contest.  We only have two...  Six.  We only have six.  How many have we been through?  Three gallons, and I'm not sure how many we've been through yet.  There's four in here.  Where can we get eggnog?  Supermarket.  Somebody better go right now.  Oh, my God.  Just in case. 
[03:01:00]  Underestimation of the eggnog supply?  Just in case.  Perhaps.  All right, Anthony.  What?  This is the 11th round.  How's everyone doing?  I was studying the eggnog in the cooler.  Very good.  I like how you jumped on that, though, Opie.  You saw maybe a dilemma developing.  I saw Nathaniel to my left panicking, going, we're going through this very fast.  Yeah.  I'll be bringing a different one.  If we switch brands of eggnog, is that going to affect people?  No.  Hey.  All right.  Everyone get their 11th round down?  Steve is slowing way down, dude.  Wow, Steve.  I haven't even finished it.  Steve, you might be out. 
[03:01:30]  Steve, did you finish?  Drink, drink.  No?  Is he out?  I don't know if we made that one of our rules, did we?  Well, you have a minute to drink every round.  He's got to finish this up.  All right.  From now on, if you don't finish by the time the next round starts, you're out.  Steve barely made it.  I don't think we made that clear.  All right.  So now we're up to the 12th round, Anthony.  I know.  Steve is sounding like Frankie Blue.  No problem, baby.  And there's no alcohol in this eggnog, but it affects you the same way.  Steve, you had a problem with that last cup.  Please let us know what's going on. 
[03:02:00]  I'm not drinking this one.  Eric, get over there.  Steve, get over there.  Pay attention.  I'm all right.  You're all right?  Well, you have 25 seconds to finish that one up.  Get it down.  Get that thick beverage down, that thick, heavy beverage.  Uh-oh.  Now he's fine.  Has everyone else finished?  Swallow that thick beverage.  15 seconds, Steve.  Everyone else finished, right?  Filled with sugar.  You can do it.  10 seconds, Steve.  Steve?  Come on, Steve.  Five seconds, Steve.  Wash it down.  Oh!  He's still in, but barely. 
[03:02:30]  He's all right.  And pick up another one, Steve.  Is Ellis out?  I can't take any more down.  A small stomach Ellis is out, Anthony.  Ellis is out.  Let's say goodbye to Ellis.  Thank you, Ellis.  It was great coming up here.  He was the wrong shot in this contest with his little pea stomach.  So, uh, good luck.  That's right.  He couldn't handle any more eggnog.  Now beat it, Raisin Belly.  We're in the middle of the 13th round, Anthony.  I'm on my way, too, guys.  Huh?  What?  I'm on my way, too.  Go ahead, Steve.  Oh, come on, Steve.  Chug it.  Come on.  We've got 30 seconds left.  Come on, Steve. 
[03:03:00]  Come on.  Take it like it's the load of an uncle.  Yeah, we don't want you bowing out without finishing.  You've got to at least give it a shot.  We want to see some puking, man.  You can't get a puke.  He'll be fine.  All right.  You've got 20 seconds.  Everyone else finished their round, right?  Come on.  All right.  Here goes Steve.  Come on.  Take that cup of liquid snot.  Come on, Steve.  Give it a shot.  Thick and creamy.  Come on, Steve.  Ten seconds to get the 13th shot of eggnog down.  Uh-oh.  He's having some trouble.  Come on, Steve.  Five, four, three, two. 
[03:03:30]  You can't do it.  He's out.  He is out.  And the 14th round started.  There it is.  Now, Steve, you've got to spin it in a circle.  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  Thanks, guys, for letting me come on.  Thank you, Steve.  There he goes.  We'll see you after the contest,  but we just want to clear the studio out.  Oh.  Oh, burned.  Anthony, this is for the Modify.  Burned.  We're down to eight contestants.  We're in the 14th round of the eggnog drinking contest.  What's going on?  We lost two in a row.  What's going on?  We lost two in a row.  Everyone else.  I've been concentrating on those two 
[03:04:00]  that have just been knocked out of the competition.  Haven't really given any attention to the other guys.  How are we feeling?  Fine.  Good.  Everyone else is fine.  Wait.  Everyone drank their 14th like nothing?  Yep.  Wow.  We're just sitting here waiting for the 15th round to start.  It doesn't affect you guys that two guys are out now?  They don't care.  It's good.  It motivates us.  It motivates you.  It doesn't make you think,  wow, a few more shots and it's going to get ugly here.  That too.  All right.  Wow.  There's a cheering section outside of the window  holding up signs now.  Great.  They got fans. 
[03:04:30]  Big boys.  And the 15th round starts.  Go, Pat.  And then another sign.  Hope you puke.  Wait.  We only have seven contestants?  I don't know.  Didn't we start with ten?  We started with nine.  Oh, we started with nine.  Okay.  I don't know, Opie.  All right.  I just start thinking of Fox's ear.  What?  Oh, we had a spot for the guy from Maine.  All right.  This is the 15th round, Anthony.  It seems the eggnog is draining any humor  that might have been in these guys. 
[03:05:00]  Jesus.  Dice, how are you feeling over there?  Feeling fine.  Feeling fine.  Okay.  Pat, you all right?  Piece of cake?  I don't even notice it yet.  Uh-oh.  I'll go a couple more hours.  A couple more hours.  All right.  Yeah, you can.  Everyone got their fifth.  BJ's still in the contest, Ant.  BJ, yeah.  He was thought to have been one of the long-cats.  But he's standing too stiff.  BJ's not happy right now.  He's standing too relaxed.  He really wants to vomit.  I was surprised to see Steve out so early.  Yeah?  Yeah, he's a big guy.  Do good.  I knew that an old change purse stomach 
[03:05:30]  was going to have trouble.  But we're up to the 16th round  of the eggnog drinking contest.  John slammed his.  Doug from Arizona slammed his.  Going around the room.  Everyone's still having no problem.  John, how are you feeling?  You're rubbing your belly.  You're rubbing your belly.  Just massaging it in there.  All right.  It's good.  I'm getting close, I think.  I hope not.  BJ's getting close.  Now, what makes you think you're getting close?  I want to know what the feeling is. 
[03:06:00]  I don't know.  Bloat?  Kind of, yeah.  But the thing is, like, the other two, they just quit.  I'm going to keep drinking until I puke my brain.  Do we see your pins?  That's what we want to hear today.  Somebody just shit that pounce.  I don't know if that's strategy or something, but it is horrific.  Someone fart over there.  Who the F farted?  Kenny, is it you?  That was my big announcement.  All right, well, Anthony, it stinks in the studio. 
[03:06:30]  There it is, guys.  Another one.  17th round in the eggnog drinking contest.  17th.  And John just slamming it.  Pat slammed his.  Doug from Arizona.  A little slow, but he got down.  A little slower than before.  And BJ still in the competition.  Everyone done?  John?  Hooray.  Joe or eggnog?  They better hurry up.  No.  How are we doing on eggnog supply?  How many left?  Three over there.  How many over there?  We should be all right for now until we get more.  Two left over here. 
[03:07:00]  They're going to buy too many now.  They're going to bring back 30.  Oh, we're going to have like 800 things of eggnog over here.  Guys, any, Matt, how are you doing?  It's filling up, but it's, yeah, just make a little more room.  Making a little more room.  Oh, my God.  I like his flaming shirt.  I like Steve.  BJ's closing his eyes, Anthony, and concentrating.  Is it a concentrating move or is it like I'm going to puke move?  It's a concentrating move, trying to ignore that little sharp pain in my stomach right  now.  And 18. 
[03:07:30]  There we go.  It's going to be a little hard to ignore when you're drinking a little more.  Here we go.  The 18th round of the eggnog drinking contest.  Pat's just slamming.  Wow.  Pat's unbeatable.  What does Dice have to say about that, though?  Dice?  I think it's me and Pat at the end.  Really?  You're having no problem?  Dice and Pat having no problem?  I'm a long-eyed alky.  What do you expect?  Matt having a little bit of a problem.  Joe just making a lot of faces.  I don't know what that means, Anthony.  But he seems to be putting it down okay.  BJ, I got a few more rounds left in me, and if he doesn't show any cracks, it's his. 
[03:08:00]  No, no.  You got it.  I mean, we need to see some puke, man.  You got to take one for the team.  BJ?  His stomach's pretty full.  Oh, you're fine, BJ.  Yeah, he's...  Sure.  Wait, did you finish your last one?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  So everyone finished it.  18th round is done.  Doug, how are you feeling over there from Arizona?  I'm going until I vomit.  All right.  The Arizona spirit.  Who's cheating?  I was...  Figured out quick.  You were what?  Grab number nine.  Fuck it.  Go with nine.  Oh, they're mixing up each other. 
[03:08:30]  All right.  Here we go.  19th round has begun.  Somebody else's backwash?  In the eggnog drinking contest.  Someone is...  The notes are going up on the window.  Do it for Connor, BJ.  There's a hope you puke on the window, and big boys rule, go Pat.  I think...  BJ's ready to puke.  Eric was a little alarmed that Joe was having a problem.  Did he gag a little?  Joe's fine.  A little...  A little reflection.  A little...  Ah, a little trouble getting that one down, huh?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Well, you have 30 seconds. 
[03:09:00]  BJ's going to puke soon.  This may be at this one.  Nah, you'll be fine, BJ.  Come on, BJ.  Well, he got that down, right?  BJ's face is looking a little different than earlier.  That festive, I'm here having fun look, gone from his face.  It's been replaced by a holy shit, I'm going to vomit look.  That determined, I will not puke.  You know that look of you when you're fucked up and you know you're going to vomit?  I'm not going to puke, man.  Not this time.  You're fine, dude.  You're fine.  I just got to get through my radio shift.  Kenny.  Baby. 
[03:09:30]  And 20th round has begun in the eggnog drinking contest.  Kenny, you can let the girls and stuff in.  We have more room in the studio.  Yeah.  Pour eggnog, please.  Oh, wow.  Uh-oh, BJ.  BJ, you're fine.  Take it down.  All eyes are on BJ.  Oh, his glasses are coming off.  He took his glasses off.  Uh-oh.  He doesn't want to fall in.  He doesn't want to fall in the...  He got 45 seconds.  ...in the fell as he pukes.  Come on, BJ.  Come on, BJ.  Plenty of time, BJ.  BJ.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh! 
[03:10:00]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Here it is!  Should I finish this so I can puke more?  Yeah, you can.  Go ahead, BJ.  Sure, you got 20 seconds.  Everyone else finished the 20th round.  BJ, we're going to have to say goodbye to BJ.  Like a champ, he's finishing up the 20th.  Oh, wow.  What a good sport he is.  What a good egg.  What a trooper, man.  Let's hear it for BJ.  Whackbag.com.  Whackbag.com, yes.  Our first vomit release.  That was a pretty puke.  That was a good one. 
[03:10:30]  Here it is.  Uh-oh, Joe.  You dragged it down, right, Joe?  You're all right.  Joe just drank it down.  He's holding the edges of the bucket and leaning over a little and bouncing.  Was that his 20th or the 21st?  Yeah, that's one.  That was 20th.  Whatever we're up to.  All right.  That was fine.  Oh, so Joe still has to do the 21st.  No, no.  Joe just did the 21st.  No, that was fine.  Oh, he sucked that one right down.  Oh, okay.  You can't make him spin in a circle after every shot.  How nice of this is.  Whoa.  All right.  We're down.  BJ's still puking out there.  Is he?  Oh, he's going, oh, that was cool. 
[03:11:00]  Thank you, Club Soda County.  All right.  What did Jimmy Norton just do?  Did you get that on tape?  I went to look out the window, and I fucking forgot that the glass comes in.  I just smashed my head on it.  It's double-paned with about a foot and a half in between, and he thought it was the far  window, so he went to look out it and smashed his head.  Did he puke?  Yes, he did.  Did you puke?  Yeah.  I slunk him out.  Oh, Joe is out. 
[03:11:30]  Joe is out.  Ready to drink more.  Punch out, Mark.  Wow.  Joe puked.  All right.  Joe puked.  The 22nd round of the eggnog drinking contest.  Oh, no.  Why don't we move the contestants into the center so we know who's who now?  We've got Doug from Arizona.  We've got John still in the contest.  We've got Matt, Dice, and Pat.  Wow.  We're down to the last five, Anthony.  We have had two puking losses.  That's a good sign for me.  This is for the MyFi, the portable XM satellite radio.  The Wolf.  Shane, ring us on.  Which one?  The shit dicks are behind you, Dice. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Classic.  They're putting up signs as the contest continues.  Look at that smudge your head left on the window, Jim.  I know.  I know.  That big spot on the window where you clocked your head.  Eric, everyone get their 20-second shot down?  Yep.  Okay.  Yep.  We're coming up on, what, 10 seconds left?  Before the next one.  Nope.  They're all gone.  Two people out by puking.  Two more out by just saying they've had it.  And we have five seconds left before the next shot, guys.  Here it comes. 
[03:12:30]  There you go.  And we're up to the 23rd round of the eggnog drinking contest.  Pat putting that one down like he put down his first, Opie.  My brother's not seen the case.  My brother's very impressed with Pat.  I'm getting a good whip to puke in a garbage can.  How is it?  It's great.  It's beautiful.  Uh-oh.  Nice and creamy.  Doug from Arizona having a little problem.  He came a long way, Anthony.  Come on, Doug.  Think of all the egg yolks.  We're going to have to eat oatmeal for a week and get our cholesterol back down.  Probably a month.  Your stomach's like a side-side when you bring up cholesterol.  Wait, what?  Dice, who brings up cholesterol when they're trying to talk shit? 
[03:13:00]  That's a good point.  Go have a piece of bacon.  Your cholesterol will get higher today.  That was just fucking stupid.  Doug is just sipping, Anthony.  I don't think he's going to make it.  No, he's not going to make it.  Come on, Doug.  We've got 15 seconds left, Doug.  Doug said he'll drink until he pukes.  Doug from Arizona is still in, Anthony.  What a trooper.  He's still in.  Drinking like one of those Arizona Indians.  Nothing?  They prefer Native Americans.  Wait, is everyone in?  Matt and I make this one. 
[03:13:30]  Matt's got...  No.  Matt's fine.  That's right.  Drink it down.  Wait, is he one behind?  No.  No, he's on.  No.  Okay.  I thought he was behind.  So this is the 24th round of the eggnog drinking contest.  How are you feeling?  And Matt looks like he's...  It's filling up.  It's good between Doug and Matt.  That one out next, I think.  Doug has a full cup left.  With 40 seconds to go.  It's been 20 seconds.  Come on, Doug.  You can do it.  To this round, he hasn't taken a sip.  There's his first sip.  Doug, you flew all the way from Arizona on JetBlue, man.  Think about the motion of that plane. 
[03:14:00]  Turbulence.  30 seconds, Doug.  25 seconds, Doug.  The smell of a bad pussy.  He is trying, man.  Wash his ears.  Yeah.  A little rough.  Someone scrape it their tongue and hold it under your nose.  He's...  15 seconds.  15 seconds, Anthony.  He's fine.  Is the end of the...  Just suck it.  Oh!  Wow!  Wow, that was as close as you could come to puking.  You got five seconds, my friend.  Come on, Doug.  Five seconds.  Come on.  Slam it.  Slam it.  Slam it.  Slam it down. 
[03:14:30]  You got it.  Yeah, he just made it, Anthony.  There it is.  Just made it.  And just in time to do another.  The 25th round...  Oh!  Matt has puked.  Matt is out.  He's shaking like a dog and it's flying everywhere.  Matt is out.  Matt is out of the contest.  Just couldn't do it.  Wow.  Couldn't do it.  Let's hear it for Matt.  Man, his puke went kind of flying all over the place. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, my God.  It was like a scene out of Turner and Hooch.  Yeah, that's exactly it.  He's shaking his head and vomits flying.  Uh-oh.  Doug's got a problem again, Anthony.  Doug's got 20 seconds left and he's got almost a full cup there.  Come on, Doug.  You flew in for a drink.  Wait.  And I'm also noticing Dice doesn't have a...  All right.  He's getting it down.  No, Dice went...  10 seconds left.  Yeah, Dice went with some strategy.  Wait till the last minute.  Oh, Doug is bowing out.  Doug, you're bowing out with that zona.  Oh, and that's it. 
[03:15:30]  That's it.  We got a gag out of Doug.  Dice is having problems.  She's having problems.  Dice is having problems now.  Please.  I think Matt puking right next to Dice was a little bit of a problem for Dice.  All right.  We got Dice, Pat, and John left in the contest.  There's only three guys left.  Dice, you got 45 seconds and a full glass.  You haven't touched it yet.  What are you thinking?  Absolutely nothing.  All right.  He's having some trouble.  No, he's fine.  He's fine.  Uh-oh.  Wait.  Is he putting it down? 
[03:16:00]  Yep.  Hold on.  Uh-oh.  Why don't you at least hold your cup so you can finish it if you feel the urge?  Dice, you have 25 seconds left.  I don't know.  It's for the my five.  Everyone is moving away from Dice.  Come on, Dice.  You just got to wolf it.  Here he goes.  Just shoot that down.  Dice.  It's not going to get you, Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice is still in, Anthony.  He finished it.  Nice.  Dice and John.  I haven't heard that chant for 10 years. 
[03:16:30]  And bang.  There's another.  Pat washing it right down.  Oh!  Was that a puke?  Oh, yes, it was.  Oh, yeah.  It was a power boot.  God damn.  Dice is out of the 27th round.  Eggnog drinking contest.  Dice.  Good job, though.  Wow.  Let's hear it for Dice.  I'm going to bow out gracefully.  We are extreme dot com.  Very good.  There he goes.  Dice.  Made a great effort, Anthony.  It is down to John and Pat.  John and Pat have done their shots already. 
[03:17:00]  They both get a garbage pail.  The first guy to puke loses, obviously.  And the other guy gets the MiFi.  We're just down to these two.  On the satellite radio.  This is it.  Wow.  Here we go.  Guys, how are you both feeling?  Good enough?  Were you confident that you can win this?  I'm winning.  And Pat?  I'm fine.  Pat is fine.  That's totally fine.  That's a big fuck, man.  Pat came in second place on our last, the Cherry Darts competition.  Just missed winning a MiFi.  This time, I mean, he's hell-bent.  But come back.  He is confident he's winning this. 
[03:17:30]  And ding.  28th round of the Eggnog drinking contest.  Straight psycho arms.  Pat just knocks it right back.  John.  Pat.  Very quick second.  Pat.  More Eggnog.  Yay.  We don't need that much.  That's all right.  We had to make sure.  We don't need that much, Danny.  That's funny.  Danny, we didn't need more Eggnog.  John, you got it down, right?  Thank you.  All right.  They both got it down.  That's all down.  They have their next shot in their hands already.  Hold on.  Interesting.  How many more shots do you guys think you could do?  How many you got?  Pat's feeling no ill effects from this whatsoever. 
[03:18:00]  I don't know, though.  It might be striking.  Just another day for me.  John, are you feeling any ill effects?  I'm definitely feeling it, but I can keep going.  I think he's playing possum.  He's hurting.  You think he's hurting a little bit?  Yeah, he's hurting.  All right.  And, John, where are you from again?  Connecticut.  Connecticut.  And Pat's from?  Munaki.  Munaki.  Jersey and Connecticut.  Jersey.  I got diabetes, but I got nine more toes.  Oh, wow.  That wasn't bad, though.  I like him.  He takes a lot of practice weights.  And, guys, look what time it is. 
[03:18:30]  29.  This is how many shots Jim from PA, who's on the phone, thought the winner would do without  puking, by the way.  Wow.  Pat knocks it right back.  John, a little slower drinking than Pat.  Uh, it's like a two-gulp thing, or three maybe, and then Pat just knocks this back like it's  nothing.  I have not yet begun to drink.  Wow.  All right.  What was that?  29?  That was 29.  That was 29.  We're coming up on our 30th shot.  That is 60 ounces of creamy, thick, viscous, land-o-lakes eggnog. 
[03:19:00]  When Pat's walking down the street, people just point at him and say, there's Pat, the  best there's ever been.  Great.  All right.  We're just kind of waiting.  Pat letting off a little steam.  I'm rumbling from Mount Vesuvius.  And John, uh, John has a posture to him that looks a little uncomfortable.  Yeah, he's not moving. 
[03:19:30]  As we start the 30th round of the eggnog drinking contest.  30 double shots of eggnog, Anthony.  Two gulps for Pat.  I'm going to move for some eggnog.  Thank you.  He just takes that other cuff.  Good day to you, sir.  You know, it really makes you appreciate the athleticism of these two when you see how  easily the others were knocked out.  That's the difference between the people that came and might have thought they had a chance  and the true champions in eggnog drinking, Opie. 
[03:20:00]  I'm really amazed that these guys are so above and beyond the guys that have been counted  out.  Pat?  And I didn't think I'd accomplish anything in life but this.  John?  Uh, all right.  Oh, man, John.  I'm rooting for you.  I'm getting there.  Don't let this big fuck beat you.  I'm not done yet.  Not done.  Here we go, Anthony.  We're just about ready for the 31st round in the eggnog drinking contest. 
[03:20:30]  You know, I like Pat, but I would like him to be the Susan Lucci of my fives, you know?  Where he's always in it but just can't seem to pull it off kind of thing.  They both got it down pretty easily.  The Buffalo Bills of my fives.  A lot of burping going on.  Size 14.  Size 14.  Size 14.  We haven't played that in a while.  Need some help.  Would you?  Would you?  Would you?  Would you?  Pat?  I got nothing. 
[03:21:00]  It puts the eggnog in its belly.  Does this every minute.  She spilled my eggnog.  This is like the lull before the storm, Anthony.  They're just piling up, aren't they?  Oh, it's the Autobahn in the fog.  All right.  Oh, God.  John, head tilted slightly askew.  He's bent over a little.  Is it hard for you to stand up completely straight now?  I think Pat has him psyched out. 
[03:21:30]  He might.  All right.  It's the 32nd round in the eggnog drinking contest.  Aaron from Texas.  This is what he thought the winner would do without puking, by the way.  Wow.  And right in the hand.  No problem, John?  It's getting there.  It's getting herculating.  Come on, John.  Hang in there.  Hang in there, John.  Are either of you getting a nauseous feeling?  Yeah.  Oh, really?  I'm just starting.  No, just starting to drink.  Right, right.  Mmm, this is really a tough one. 
[03:22:00]  Holy shit.  Let's say hi to Aaron in Texas real fast.  Aaron.  Yeah.  They did 32 shots, no problem.  Yes?  Yes.  That's too much damn eggnog.  I know.  Well, the next guy, Jim from Illinois, can we get him on the line?  Any of these guys on the line or no?  He said that the winner would do 33 shots without puking.  It's like Steve's closet on TV.  Yeah, the big fire on the parkway.  All right, Anthony.  A little long in the action, but we're just about ready for the 33rd round of the eggnog 
[03:22:30]  turkey contest.  There it is.  Oh, my gosh.  Yummy.  That is just not even waiting.  Pat just chugs it right.  I hate Pat.  Pat, how are you feeling?  Fine.  John?  He is built for this, John.  Yeah, I might have to give it to him.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  All right.  John.  No, John.  John.  John.  John.  Come on.  Come on, John.  I finished my last one.  I can try another.  Yeah.  Uh-oh. 
[03:23:00]  Pat has to be feeling confident.  You've got to be feeling confident, Pat.  Yes, I am.  This could be a scenario where Pat is like the Yankees and John is like the Red Sox.  You count them out.  You think it's all over.  Looks pretty much a done deal.  Jim?  Yeah.  From Illinois.  You might be out.  They both did 33 shots.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Yeah.  One more.  Come on, guys.  One more.  And here we go.  We're just about ready to start the 34th round of the eggnog drinking contest. 
[03:23:30]  Jared, by the way, from Maine, who hates Ben, he said that the winner would do 35 shots.  35.  He might be right on.  Maybe.  Pat, no problem once again.  Pat, just putting it right down.  John having a...  Come on, John.  You have 40, 50 seconds.  You're fine.  Come on, John.  There you go.  You're fine.  There it is.  No problem, John.  John just put another one down.  It's really a little tough.  Well, we got some audio from the Tonight Show appearance.  Opie and Anthony.  It's great.  I like to have those guys on radio.  Wow, that's really nice.  Really nice.  Opie and Anthony show on XM Satellite Radio.  It starts with an O&A plug before headlines. 
[03:24:00]  Opie and Anthony show on XM Satellite Radio.  Very nice.  Test tested.  Leno approved.  They plugged us like three times last night.  Yep.  Opie and Anthony show.  How to show the news.  How to show the news.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Did I just fart?  We're about to...  We're getting close to the 35th round of the eggnog drinking contest.  Jared from Maine.  What's up, Jared?  John not picking up the cup after his...  I think it's coming.  Hold on.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Hold on. 
[03:24:30]  You can do it.  Jared?  Oh, boy.  Oh!  Hold on.  Hello.  Another volley.  Another volley of vomit.  Oh!  Another.  A third volley of vomit.  Oh, my God.  Oh, the humanity.  Oh, my God.  Power booting.  Power booting.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  I am speechless.  Time for another shot. 
[03:25:00]  And Pat wins and puts another one down.  More.  More.  More.  Pat.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  Pat.  John.  Victory shot.  Let's hear it for John.  Wow.  Come on, Pat.  Unbelievable.  And Pat's drinking another one.  Wait, how many are you up to?  Let's see how many you can do.  More.  More.  How many was that?  37.  That was two after.  37.  37.  This is my victory lap.  All right, let's just keep.  Jared, guess what? 
[03:25:30]  You won the other MyFive.  We'll talk to you in a minute here.  But first, let's say hi to, say hi.  Let's say bye to John, I guess.  John and John.  What a great effort.  Three powerful fire hose boots into that garbage pail.  It was stunning, wasn't it?  It was the first one.  Just this powerful fire hose-like nozzle spray of puke.  And then, bam, another.  And then, bam, another.  The worst part was I farted during each one, too.  Did you?  Yeah. 
[03:26:00]  Wonderful.  Cheers, guys.  Thanks for having me on.  John.  HappyAnthony.net.  Thanks.  HappyAnthony.net.  What an effort.  What an effort.  There he goes.  John, you represented well today, buddy.  And Pat.  Hey, John, John.  Drinking another one.  Oh, nailed him.  Nailed him.  There's another one with my name on it.  All right, now just for the hell of it.  We're going to see how many shots Pat can do here.  He's up to 38.  He might finish every single one.  39.  39.  Keep filling him up.  Yeah, let's just keep filling him up.  I'm a little thirsty.  Let's watch the fat guy puke.  I'm a little thirsty. 
[03:26:30]  You've got to give him the minute, though.  You've got to give him the time, right?  Why?  Okay.  Now he's just putting him down like a madman.  Does somebody have a blood glucose meter on him?  All right.  You can do it at your pace.  I am at my pace.  You're up to what?  40?  This is 41.  40.  Come on, now.  41.  You've got to stop.  50's a nice even number.  All right, let's go for 50.  We'll go for 50.  We're at 41.  You're not really diabetic, are you?  Yeah.  Oh.  God, if he loses a leg, he gets a mi-fi and a prosthetic. 
[03:27:00]  We could call this the Mabel King commemorative contest.  There goes 42.  That was a little warm.  Uh-oh.  That's the first even hint of a complaint I've heard from Pat.  Yeah.  Could be the turning point.  I do feel my stomach going up into my ribs a little bit.  We just want to set the bar for future contests.  Yeah.  43.  Pat's the heavyweight champion.  What do you got?  This is 40 what?  43.  43 going down. 
[03:27:30]  43 double shots of eggnog, Anthony.  Wow.  Oh, I know.  What are you thinking, Pat?  It won't be accurate, but I'm thinking I can't wait for breakfast.  All right.  Here goes 44.  Yeah?  Anything?  You're looking a little different, though.  A bit peaked.  Yeah.  Well, I'm a winner now.  You won a mi-fi.  Yeah.  Great if he throws up on us. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah.  His shorts out.  Sparks flying out of it.  Puke.  He's taking eggnog out of it.  How many is that, Eric?  This is 45.  45 double shots of eggnog.  Scraping puke.  Off the display.  Yeah.  You know that nice and new smell of electronics?  No.  It's ruined.  You look worried.  It's a vile stomach.  This is 46.  46.  46.  46.  Double shots of eggnog.  All right.  You've got to get to 50.  Hey, I can pick up your tree.  I've got a nice big van.  Everything out of this guy. 
[03:28:30]  47.  47, Anthony.  47.  47.  More crash in the back?  Oh, my God.  He's done 12 since the contest ended.  Amazing.  Yeah.  Where am I at?  This is 48.  48.  Two more left, and we'll just call it.  No, I think he should keep calling.  Are you kidding?  Till what?  He won't be able to go.  Till what?  It's up to...  This is 49.  Past 50.  No way. 
[03:29:00]  He's got to go past 50, because if he pukes, then he's actually doing himself a favor.  He'll get all of it out of him.  This is number 50.  I don't think he's going to puke.  No, he won't.  I don't think he...  It has to.  It doesn't bother him.  He's superhuman.  Yeah.  That's 50?  How does 50 feel?  50 feels like victory.  Just keep going, man.  Out of curiosity, I want to see it.  51.  51. 
[03:29:30]  Curiosity?  Hope he would be great in the Third Reich.  No, keep putting these spikes in his head, and let's see how long it takes for him to pass out.  Sew her legs together while she gives birth.  52.  52?  Pat, what do you think?  I'm slowing down.  All right, good.  All right.  No, you're nuts.  Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat.  He's slowing down.  No, he isn't.  He just sucked that one right down.  And I started my diet today. 
[03:30:00]  Oh.  Jesus, Harry Chapin.  53.  53.  Uh-oh.  Someone's got to figure out how many calories he's done.  Wow, yeah.  How many calories?  Well, it only goes up to eight digits.  Uh-oh.  Did you just kind of...  Yeah, he's starting to gurgle.  No.  Eric, what are we up to?  This is 54.  54.  Jesus.  He's making everyone else look like a bunch of pussies. 
[03:30:30]  Oh, he laughs at them.  Pat laughs at them.  Isn't he double what some of the guys were out at?  Oh, yeah.  Way.  Pat?  His hands are in his pockets.  He's getting uncomfortable.  Yeah, it's uncomfortable.  Uncomfortable.  All right.  You want to keep going, Pat?  Oh, a couple more.  Yeah, why not?  55.  I'm one for the road.  You'll probably crash soon.  I'm going to put windshield wipers on the inside of my windshield.  Gray on that button, you son of a bitch.  What is this now?  This is 55.  55.  All right.  Kenny, what do you think? 
[03:31:00]  I think that's good for me.  I'm not standing nowhere near him, because when he lets loose, it's going to go across  the studio.  I think it could hit the back window behind Anthony.  Just think of the pressure that stomach's under.  It is.  It's like a big rubber bag all stretched, waiting to squeeze it out.  He's going to have hypervelocity.  He's going to puke.  It's going to keep blacks out of a college in 1964.  I'm just going to roll him out to the sidewalk. 
[03:31:30]  Let's turn the lights back on.  All right.  That's for Kenny.  This is 56.  I think he needs to get to 60.  56 is such a weird number.  Yeah, it is.  56.  I mean, what is that?  Pants?  Wow.  What's wrong, Pat?  You're fine.  I'm feeling a little full.  Of course you are.  A little full.  All right.  57.  Three more.  Is he burping?  I'm starting to space out that garbage can.  No, you won't puke.  You have four more.  Oh, man.  You're fine.  We're all starting to like... 
[03:32:00]  I'm starting to look around where I can duck.  It'll be after 60.  What?  It'll be after 60, though.  Oh, cocky.  Oh, you think?  Oh, look at you being cocky.  58.  Have you ever drank as much eggnog before?  Martini Steve's in the studio.  He's figuring out how many calories with his little calculator.  What's he up to now?  57.  This is 58 right here.  And they're double shots, sweetie.  Right, right.  Yeah.  So how much is one, Steve?  One 70.  Multiply that by 57.  Thank you, Jim.  58 now.  58 now.  Just add...  Take 57 and add whatever...  Jim, can you stop, please? 
[03:32:30]  40 calculations.  All right, Pat.  9,860 so far.  9,000.  Just about 10,000 calories.  This is number 59.  59, Pat.  He's really slowing down.  Yeah.  The face is looking a little different.  How are you feeling?  Getting ready to go.  One more.  Oh, boy.  All right, here's 60.  That's the first one he hasn't shot. 
[03:33:00]  No, it's really slow.  But he's also not doing it in a minute.  He would probably do more if he had a minute in between each one.  Yeah, maybe.  Pat, what do you think?  Ready to go.  Pretty soon.  If you do 60, I think you could do 62.  Nah, 62.  Don't make him go up at 62.  62 is fine.  Yeah, 62.  Have you ever drank...  This is 61.  Yeah.  Yeah, you could do two more.  Yeah, two more and then...  What are you, a gay?  What are you, a girl?  Come on.  Come on, eggnog dick.  Oh, he's really slowing down.  Yeah. 
[03:33:30]  That's not done.  He didn't finish it.  That's not done.  Yeah, you didn't finish that.  That's not done, kid.  What's wrong with you?  60 what?  61.  61?  62.  Oh, 62.  Yes.  Oh, oh.  He's like William Holden looking at the coffee table.  Oh, my God.  He just slammed 62.  Well, if you do 62, I think you could do what?  63, Jim?  I can't bend over to puke.  Oh, well.  Someone better light a fire over here.  Someone's moving.  Someone better raise that fucking garbage can, man.  Look, dude. 
[03:34:00]  If you did 62, you could do 63.  I mean, come on.  It's only one more.  What do you think, Pat?  Ugh.  There has to be a grand finale.  Pat almost 63.  Doubled.  Yeah, there has to be a grand finale.  You can't just walk out after 62.  It's such an odd number.  It really is.  All right.  Here goes Pat.  63.  Maybe he needs some encouragement, everyone, in the studio.  Let's go, Pat.  Yeah.  63.  Don't puke.  He won't puke.  He's fine. 
[03:34:30]  Pat, what do you think?  He's fine.  There's no more room at the inn.  Wow.  You sold out?  All right.  What are we up to here?  This is 64.  64.  Done.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  What does that mean, Pat?  You can't just walk out after 63.  65 is such a good number.  I'm going to explode.  You want a donut?  Oh, yeah.  This is going to be like from the Monty Pine movie.  Waffle, Waffle, Waffle, Waffle, Thin.  Mr. Creoset. 
[03:35:00]  That's the right ta-ta, but the wrong ho-ho, Pat.  Well, Pat, what do you think?  I'm getting gas pains now.  Uh-oh.  Gas pains?  Oh.  Oh, please shit your pants.  All right.  64.  I mean, he's so close to 65.  65 is that number.  65 is his max.  He can't go over 65.  That's enough.  Yeah, I don't think.  I think he's a pussy.  He can't go over 65.  He certainly can.  No, he can't.  No, 65.  That's a fine number to stop at.  Hey, they're cheering outside.  They want 70.  70 is such an even number, I think. 
[03:35:30]  65.  Be happy with 65.  I don't know.  They want 70 outside.  The other contestants want 70.  Well, that's your BJ puke.  He's fine.  Yeah, BJ's fine.  Look at him.  He's smiling.  What is he up to, Eric?  This is 65.  65?  Only 65.  65 double shots of eggnog.  How many calories is he up to?  Well over 10,000 now.  I think there's a point where I have to make myself puke.  Uh-oh.  No.  Yeah, you might have to.  Yeah, you might have to.  You've got to get rid of that stuff. 
[03:36:00]  11,050.  Oh, no.  He has raised his two fingers, Anthony.  Do you want to do 66?  66.  66.  66.  What do I win?  66.  You're going to puke it out.  The respect of the Opie and Anthony show.  You're the champ.  Here he goes.  66.  Dude, you're raising the bar for a future contest here.  66 down.  66.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  I have to make myself.  No.  Yeah, you might have to make yourself.  Oh, then you better go before 67.  I say you. 
[03:36:30]  It's like a valve.  It's going in, but it ain't coming out.  Pat, Pat, I say you do 70 and then you make yourself puke.  I think that's.  I think everyone would like to see that, right?  How many have you done?  This is 67 right here.  67 double shots of eggnog.  Oh.  Holy shit.  Only three more in there.  Only three more.  That's okay.  That was 67.  Oh, my God.  Dude, he's getting 20 pounds in front of our eyes, man.  All right.  Here comes 68.  68.  What are you thinking, man?  You're studying him. 
[03:37:00]  I don't know what to think.  68 double shots.  You're sweating sweat.  Just have him puke.  Well, no.  He's got to get to 70.  69.  No.  He's got to get to 70.  It's really.  No.  I say stop.  He's got to get to 70.  You should stop him.  What do you want, Pat?  You want to walk away after 68 or?  It doesn't matter.  If he pukes, 69 going down.  It's all coming out.  69.  69 done. 
[03:37:30]  Take a breath.  70.  An even 70 shots.  No more, dude.  No more.  Wow.  All right.  Let it up.  70 double shots.  Meg Donk from Pat.  You doubled with the other guy.  From Monaki, New Jersey.  Representing.  Yeah.  What do you want to do?  Bring the thriller park.  What do you want to do?  I want a puke.  All right.  Then you better do that.  Why don't you lift those two fingers up?  He's lifting his two fingers up.  Oh, boy.  That's all right.  He's got to do it.  Here we go.  He's got three fingers in his mouth.  Oh, Jesus.  This is Pat from Monaki, Anthony.  This guy. 
[03:38:00]  That was just a warm-up.  That's two shots.  That was a warm-up.  That was a half gallon on the inside.  All right.  Everyone, listen.  Listen.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[03:38:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, I don't know.  Oh.  I've never seen someone say...  Get me a bucket.  Oh, thank you. 
[03:39:00]  I can't live any harder.  Oh, my God.  There's no way more is going to come out of this guy.  Is that it, Pat?  No.  It's 12,000 calories.  He's still puking.  Bad day to start a diet. 
[03:39:30]  Maybe he can get his name a puke shot.  Well done.  Oh, you're done?  Yeah.  Pat from Monarcha, New Jersey.  Thank you.  Wow, was that a marathon puke.  How do you feel, man?  You all right?  I feel better now.  Of course.  Holy S.  He did 70 double shots of eggnog.  He got it out, too.  He got most of that out.  Oh, yeah.  That was a lot.  Well, Pat's pretty heavy. 
[03:40:00]  That bucket's, like, swimming.  Make Eric take that out.  I think Eric should have to carry that out.  Eric vomited.  Eric vomited.  How are you, Eric?  You can't speak.  Eric, take those buckets out.  Uh-oh.  Take that bucket out.  Eric.  Smell it.  Darren, get Eric on mic.  Eric, what's up?  No, no, no.  What's the matter?  I'm going to throw up.  No, you're not.  You're fine.  Smell that wonderful puke smell.  Just, Eric, be careful.  Listen to that slosh around in there, Eric. 
[03:40:30]  Oh, wow.  Wow.  I was laughing so hard.  I couldn't breathe.  Hey, I'll give somebody ten bucks to smell Pat's two fingers.  All right.  High five.  Oh, Kathy.  All right, Pat, congratulations.  You won the MiFi.  Thank you.  Oh, it does smell.  Now I smell it.  Notice Ben hasn't been around.  Of course not.  Because Ben hates this stuff.  Where is it?  He's calling me his hair with a hammer.  No, it was puke.  It's fucking...  Wow.  It does reek in here now. 
[03:41:00]  That was 4.3 gallons at 12,000 calories.  Nice.  You drank 4.3...  Not gallons.  4.3 gallons.  You sure?  Yeah, 4 ounces per cup.  70 cups.  4 ounces per cup.  Do some more math, Steve.  Okay.  I thought it was 2 ounces per cup.  It should be about 2 ounces.  There's no way the guy did 4.3 gallons.  You know, Steve...  Even 2 gallons would be crazy.  It's 2 shots. 
[03:41:30]  2 shots.  It was 2 gallons, but it's still 12,000 calories.  A little over 2 gallons of eggnog from Pat.  All right, Pat.  We got to give him something extra for doing all...  He did an extra 35 shots.  He's double...  He did.  I don't know what we can give him.  We'll give him a...  We'll give him a t-shirt or something.  No.  Yeah, all right.  Why don't we get everyone out of the studio?  Pat is the winner of the eggnog drinking contest.  Congratulations.  Hey, Pat.  Any parting words?  Pat?  Parting words?  Yeah, Pat.  What do you want to say?  One.  I feel like the biggest loser. 
[03:42:00]  Oh, jeez.  Thank you, Pat.  Thank you.  Great job, Mike.  Go away.  Pete from Connecticut Online.  Yes, Pete.  Yeah, I do.  I'm going to mind if I get 27 awful jokes by the end of the eggnog.  27 awful Pat jokes.  Very good.  Thank you, Pete.  Pete from Connecticut.  Let's say hi to Eric in New York City.  Eric, what's up?  Good morning, guys.  Hey.  Good morning there, sweet tits.  Hi there, Angel.  Angel.  I have a good puke story for you.  All right.  I'm three months into dating my girlfriend. 
[03:42:30]  And I'm trying to get laid and get invited to a wedding.  I'm going to get really drunk.  Where are you calling from?  A nuclear reactor?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that hum.  We're going to cut our losses there.  Brian from Long Island.  What's up, Brian?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Syndication how?  Hey, I just wanted to say 70 shots.  It's crazy.  It's insane.  Yeah, it was definitely insane.  I cannot believe the guy just did 70 double shots of eggnog. 
[03:43:00]  Hey, where's Jared?  Remember Jared?  Oh, yeah.  Who hates Ben?  He ends up winning the other MyFy.  He guessed.  He was closest to how many shots?  40, right?  I think he was right on the button.  He said 35, I think.  35.  He did win.  He did win.  Oh, my God.  Jared, give us a call back.  You won the other MyFy today.  That's funny, watching him stick his whole fist down his throat like that and just gurgling.  It's probably better for him that he puked out, without a doubt.  That's why I wanted him to keep going because if that's settled in, I think he would have  major problems later today. 
[03:43:30]  I was actually getting worried about him.  I'm like, dude, he's diabetic, man.  I don't want to see if he gets gurgled, gurgled, gurgled.  How funny would it have been if he went into diabetic shock?  Hilarious.  We could all teabag them, all the ambulances on its way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Eric, you feeling better?  Starting to, yeah.  It really stunk, though, man.  That's sloshing vomit.  Oh, my God.  Did you get a whiff of that, dude?  Dude, how hard were you laughing?  Oh, that's too goddamn funny. 
[03:44:00]  It was, how many times did he power boot?  Like 10 times?  It's gotta be 10, and it was liquid.  Did that pill get used?  Yes.  No.  Shut up, Jimmy.  All right, Jared.  How you doing?  Good.  What's up, Jared?  I won a MyFy.  Yes, you did.  After all that, you won the other MyFy today.  Awesome.  So I guess we'll get some info from you, so stay on the line, okay?  I already got the info.  Oh, you do?  All right, congratulations.  Anything you want to say to Ben?  Ben, you're not a dick. 
[03:44:30]  Ben is kind of a dick, because he blew off the whole contest.  He's a computer in there.  Is that the computer?  He's probably answering your stupid emails.  Yeah, bring, let's get Ben in here.  There's no puke in here.  He could come back into the studio.  Ben.  I made a mistake, too.  They want to talk to you.  I only sent, like, 11 emails to Steve.  All right.  What does he say?  He's saying no.  He's not coming in.  He said he's doing stuff.  Yeah, Ben has a serious problem with...  Oh, that's right.  He wasn't in here the whole time.  No, he ran out as soon as the contest started. 
[03:45:00]  He went to screen the call.  I think he's got to be in here for these contests.  You're the boss open.  I think that you and Ed can put your feet down.  He should.  All right, Jared.  Jared, congratulations.  You won the other MiFi from Maine.  I appreciate it, guys.  I look forward to coming to the show, and you rock, Jimmy.  Thank you, buddy.  There he goes.  Jared from Maine.  Are we getting rid of all these people out here?  I would say if they want to hang for the extra time, we're almost done.  Yeah.  They're probably going to want to take pictures and stuff like that, probably.  Okay.  The gurgling, splashing sounds of vomit. 
[03:45:30]  Well, you need a rowboat going, a motorboat, a rowboat.  Fucking asshole I am.  A rowboat.  Row, row, row.  You stink.  A rowboat.  Ah, I can't find the clip.  Shut up.  A rowboat.  It was stink.  All right.  This is the end.  What are you talking about?  Of the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Well, okay.
