<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a pre-show hosted by Sam Roberts.  This pre-show heavily featured listener calls, many debating Diane's invitation to the "Unmasked" event, often using profane language.  The hosts' declared aversion to guests, causing stress for their booker Roland, was a recurring topic, despite the eventual appearance of Danny Trejo and Bob Saget on the main show. Trejo shared stories from his life, including his path from prison to Hollywood, and his collaborations with Robert Rodriguez and Eric Roberts. Saget's interview was previewed, highlighting the contrast between his clean public image and his raunchy stand-up. Other pre-show topics included Sean Hannity's comments about Opie, the missing Malaysian plane (and CNN's coverage), a Pittsburgh stabbing, a school bus fight video, incidents at a Brooklyn McDonald's, and listener-submitted unusual baby names from NYC schools.

The main show started with a discussion about the unruly behavior of middle schoolers at a McDonald's, including vandalism and pretending to use Sweet'n Low as cocaine.  This segued into listener calls about bizarre baby names like Femel, Tephylus, Clemyda, and Shea Stadium Johnson.  An NYPD officer caller attributed the McDonald's incident to a lack of parental discipline.  Audio clips of confrontations between students and teachers were played.  A humorous, crude recap of the 1977 miniseries *Roots* followed, filled with references to other TV shows and actors.  Upcoming guests Dave Attell and Brandon Steiner were mentioned, along with a 7'5" high school basketball player and further discussion of Sean Hannity's comments about the show and Opie's reluctance to appear on Hannity's show due to political disagreements.  Hannity's perceived misrepresentation of Opie's political stance was discussed at length.

The show continued with a segment focused on the hosts’ political views, expressing support for conservative candidates like Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, wishing for a "clean sweep" of Democrats and a "miserable, disastrous term" for President Obama.  This led to another critique of Sam Roberts for misrepresenting Opie’s political views.  Opie explained his preference for using humor instead of serious political debate.  A comedic bit with Dennis Falcone and his unusual sunglasses ensued, followed by discussion of Jim Norton's frustration with online political arguments, particularly concerning the Trayvon Martin/George Zimmerman case, and his Twitter interactions with Sean Hannity.  A lengthy, vulgar, and argumentative phone call with Marion advocating for Diane's "Unmasked" tickets dominated a portion of the broadcast, with speculation about potential celebrity guests like Ricky Gervais, Robert De Niro, and Jack Nicholson.  The segment concluded with advertisements.

A subsequent segment began with an emotional reaction to a movie clip showing a baby being taken, followed by graphic commentary on Rihanna's nude photos from a French magazine, comparing them to nude photos of Elaine Benes.  Listener questions from Harvey on Twitter, including Julia Louis-Dreyfus's net worth, were addressed.  A detailed and explicit recounting of a text exchange between Bobo and someone offering "Unmasked" tickets in exchange for sex acts followed.  Bobo’s subsequent phone call included confirmation of the events, his defense of his actions, and multiple hang-ups.  His sister Lindsay called in to express her disappointment.  Comedian David Teller then joined the show to promote his Comedy Central specials, "Roadwork" and "Comedy Underground," discussing other comedians and Sam Kinison's comedic style.

The final segment featured a conversation with Richie about their Long Island upbringings, including humorous stories about farts, a comedian's suitcase full of sex toys, and the deaths of Sam Kinison and John Panette.  Mickey Rooney's financial struggles were lamented. The conversation moved to humorous tombstones, potential cemetery businesses, and grave robbing, before returning to Long Island memories – dirt bomb fights, sumps, ice skating, and childhood weaponry, including an incident involving an Army ordnance simulator.  Brandon Steiner's absence due to a meeting was noted.  More Long Island memories (skitching, ice cream trucks, local characters) and Richie's childhood antics, including possible ice cream truck burglaries, were shared, with a brief, unexpected appearance by Cousin Bruce Morrow.

[00:01:00]  Welcome to the pre-show  My name is Sam Roberts and we are here  To celebrate the fact that we have another glorious day with Opie and Anthony about to begin  866-WOW1-WOW  If you want to call up the pre-show this morning  866-969-1969  Call the pre-show  Talk to me  We're going to be covering everything  That's going to go down today on the Opie and Anthony show  And getting deep 
[00:01:30]  Into all that happened on yesterday's show  Because you can't go forward  If you don't know your history  Do you know what I mean?  I think you do  866-WOW1-WOW  And you too  Can be a part of today's Opie and Anthony pre-show  It's going to be a big show  Other radio DJs were talking about us  Eric, you have that audio, right?  Right  Mr. Sean Hannity  Had Opie's name on his lips  And I think  That he should keep Opie's name 
[00:02:00]  Off his lips  I don't think Opie's going to be  Terribly happy  With what Sean Hannity said about him  Because Opie's  Gone on the record  To say that he's not a political guy  That he is  He doesn't vote  That he's just not  He doesn't affiliate himself with any party  Because he thinks they're all liars  And he was described as very liberal  By Sean Hannity yesterday  So we'll get into that  And a whole lot more  Yesterday  On the show  It started with 
[00:02:30]  One of the statements  That fills Roland's nightmares  You know how like  Everybody has those  Anxiety dreams  About your job  Going as poorly as possible  Whether it's  Opie and Anthony  Have always said  Having the radio dream  Of  Forgetting  Of not having another song to play  Or  Having that same  College dream  Or high school dream  Where you just find out  That you haven't  Gone to class 
[00:03:00]  All semester  And you're about to fail  It's those  Whatever  Whatever  However your anxiety  Manifests in its dreams  This is  Roland's anxiety  Opie and Anthony  Deciding they don't want to have  Guests on the show anymore  Roland is our talent booker  He takes his job  Very very seriously  So when Opie and Anthony  Say stuff like this  It sends him into a panic  Let's go to track  One  From yesterday's show  Sal  We just told Roland  That we're saying no  To all guests  All guests  So he's like 
[00:03:30]  Power eating in the back  Right now  He's a little upset  About that  Oh boy is he  Opie goes  When you submit  People  To be guests  On the show  He goes  Opie goes  Just put an automatic  No  In my column  Ah you know  Sometimes the guests  Are great  Yeah  And sometimes it's fun  To meet a big star  But in general  Sometimes it's what  They call a chore  Yeah  I'm not sure  How seriously  Roland takes that anymore 
[00:04:00]  I think he still  Takes it very seriously  Was he panicky  In the office at all  No he was smiling  He was smiling  Roland is a very  Mysterious guy  Because you never know  Exactly what's  Going to tip him off  Like  I guess he knew  That the guys  Have said that before  Or maybe he just knew  He wasn't going to  Cancel the guests  That we had booked  Regardless  Of how they started  The show  But Roland  Definitely  Is easy to stress out  But that's not  The first time  Opie and Anthony  Have said that 
[00:04:30]  They've said that  They don't like guests  They've said they don't  Want to have guests  On anymore  Danny Trejo  Stopped by yesterday  And listen to the stories  That Danny was telling  This is the story  Of Danny  Entering  Of course Danny Trejo  Is the guy from  Machete  That's what he's  Most famous for  Right now  But he's been  In 150,000  Different things  And he talked about  Going from prison  To becoming a  Hollywood actor  Yesterday on the show  For the 17 years  That I was out  You know  To 1985  I was just  Helping people  And then I  I was helping 
[00:05:00]  This one kid  And at night  I remember  I was getting ready  To watch Johnny Carson  And this kid  Calls me up  And says hey  There's a lot of  Blow down here  In my job  1985  He says can you  Come down  And just hang out  With me  I go yeah  So I went down  And hang out  With him  I thought  He worked  In a warehouse  Because it was  In the warehouse  District of LA  So I thought  We were going  To sit in the  Parking lot  Smoke cigarettes  Drink coffee  You know  And then  And then he was  Going to go back  In at break  And everybody  Was going to  Think we're gay 
[00:05:30]  You know  Two guys  Sitting out of  Car  And it wasn't  It was the movie  Set of a movie  Called Runaway Train  With John Voight  And Eric  Oh yeah  I remember that one  Sure  And I walked  On to it  And this guy  Is funny  This guy says  Hey do you  Want to be  In this movie  And I says  What do I  Got to do  And he says  Do you want  To be an extra  And I said  Extra what  And he said  Can you act  Like a convict  I think I got  That down 
[00:06:00]  I've been in  Every prison  In the state  Of California  I'll give it  A shot  Took off my  Shirt  And I have  That big  Tattoo  On my chest  This guy  Comes over  And says  Hey  You're Danny  Trejo  And I go  Yeah  And he goes  I saw you win  The lightweight  And the welterweight title  Up in San Quentin  I go  Yeah  You're Eddie Bunker  I knew this guy  Oh wow  And I said  Eddie what are you doing  He says  Danny  I adapted the screenplay  Because he was a writer  You know  And he used to write  He got real famous  In the joint  Writing Ritz  Because Ritz  Have to be  Grammatically correct  And they have to be 
[00:06:30]  Like you know  According to law  And he got famous  Doing that  Because he knew  How to do it  And he could spell  You know  Because if you have  One word spelt wrong  In a written  They can kick it out  Right  Right  Right  So  He says  Hey are you still boxing  And I says  I train  And he says  We need somebody  To train one of the actors  How to box  Wow  And I said  What's it pay  And he says  320 a day  And I said  How bad do you want  This guy to beat him  I thought 
[00:07:00]  I wasn't making that a week  I started training  Eric Roberts  How to box  No kidding  In the movie  Runaway Train  Andre Kodzalowski  The director  He saw that Eric  Would kind of  Do what I told him  To do  And he came over  And said  You be in movie  And I go  Okay  Alright  Wow that's  And that's how it started  That's how I got in  Because then  It drives you crazy too  Because everybody  Who wants a career  In show business  Is trying to  Make the right moves  And be in the right place  At the right time  And impress the right people 
[00:07:30]  And you gotta  You have no control over it  You have absolutely  No control over it  Because stuff like that  Just happens  And you just have to be able  To adapt to the situation  Danny Trejo was so  Interesting yesterday  Let's go to Peter  On Long Island  What's up Peter  Hey Sam  It's been a while brother  How you doing  Oh my car  Has no engine in it  That means it's sitting  In a parking lot  In my dealership  And I've been in a  Loaner car  With no XM  For almost  Four weeks  Jesus Christ  But you're back  Well no no

[00:17:30]  They're listening  For  Like what is it  About the show  That really gets  Them going  I don't know  I really don't  Bob Saget was on  The show yesterday  And that was  Another one  That Opie and  Anthony were  Sort of  Unsure about  The ironic thing  Is that ONA are  Unsure about most  Of the celebrities  That come on to  The show  That are paid  To entertain people  Like that's what  They do for a living  Is be entertaining  But they'll have  Lady Diane Marion  On the show  Seven days a week  They will add  Weekend shows  If they can have 
[00:18:00]  Lady Diane Marion  On and I get it  But it is strange  It's a strange thing  They were talking  About Bob Saget  Before he came in  A little bit yesterday  And I sensed  They were just  They were a little  Ornery yesterday  This was right along  The same time  They were talking  About not wanting  To have guests  On the show  And they talked  About how every  Other interview  With Bob Saget  They have to bring  Up the fact  That well  He was super clean  On the TV show  But he's very dirty  Let's go to track two  We got Bob Saget 
[00:18:30]  Yeah  Did you know that  Like on TV  He was like  You know  A family sitcom guy  Yeah  But in his real life  He's kind of dirty  I didn't know that  Perhaps we can  What  Did you know that  I didn't know that  I was actually  Unlike you guys  I was aware  Yeah  Because I  I saw him  As this squeaky  Clean guy  I was a  I was a bit  Surprised to find out  That in his real life  He was dirty  Wow  Because he was so  So clean for TV 
[00:19:00]  You know  I bet people go there  Thinking they're going to see  The clean guy  From the TV show  And then  They're shocked  Maybe  Right  You know  This may be an angle  That you guys want to take  With the interview today  I hope that's in our prep  I'm thinking  That we should do that  For the fifth time  Oh Jesus  Oh shit  Please don't be listening  Oh boy  We love Bob Saget  You know that  Of course we do  That's obvious 
[00:19:30]  And the name of his book  Is called Dirty Daddy  Oh  How nice is that  I can't imagine  Being in Bob Saget's shoes  And having to do that  Same interview  For years and years  I mean it was  Ten years ago I think  That the aristocrats came out  And that was the first time  That people as a general public  Became aware that he was  Actually a dirty comic  But it just comes up  We turned on Fox and Friends  When Bob Saget was on  And just listened 
[00:20:00]  As they went right there  Let's go to track four  Oh  Family man  It says right there  Yay  Saget played lovable father  On TV series  Look he's dancing  With the fucking meth head  He's good  Well and now that dad  Is dishing  Oh now that dad  Is dishing  Oh here it comes  Dad is dishing  All the dirt  From behind the scenes  On that hit show  And more  We're talking with Bob Saget  He's got a new memoir  Dirty Daddy  He joins us now  You expose yourself  In this memoir  Well in a robe  But I am  Right  Yeah it's a story about 
[00:20:30]  Actually it's about comedy  And death  And how they intersect  Because we had a lot of  That in my family's life  And with comedians  And your mom just passed away  Since I'm mom  We lost my mom  Oh my god just a couple months ago  Oh Jesus Christ  Kept me from being too funny  When I was nine  He's on the shelf  And that made me want to be funnier  At least no he's not listening right now  So it's about family  And comedians like Rodney Dangerfield  And Richard Pryor  That were influences in my life  Did your mom get to see most of what was in the book  My mom read to about 111 
[00:21:00]  And then stopped before I got to a chapter  That was called  Things I Shouldn't Have Done  That's good  And relationships I'd rather not talk about  See the thing about Bob Saget is  The world knows you  Oh no  There it is  Stand on Full House  But in real life  Bob  You have got a six sense  There it is  There it is 
[00:21:30]  The whole world knows now  That's our point  Of course  The whole world knows now  Is our point  Of course they do  We started talking to Bob Saget  Probably  Ten years ago  Probably close to ten years ago  And he was talking about that  On our show  Yeah  That's right  And it was like 
[00:22:00]  And it was right when his stand up  Started becoming like  Something people started knowing  And being like  Wow  You know  You go see this guy  You expect one thing  You get another thing  That's true  Ten years later  It's like  And do you think like  People at Fox and Friends  Are sitting there going  Oh man  Oh this is an angle we could take  Yeah I can't wait to get into this with him  Like  Do they not realize  That that's every interview  He's ever done  Why would you go out of your way  To make sure that you had the same interview 
[00:22:30]  That Bob Saget has done  Over and over again  Why be newsworthy  On a news channel  Let's go to Jeff in Philly  What's up Jeff  Morning Sammy  Morning buddy  Hey  I mean I don't know if you interacted with  Bob yesterday  But  He like sounded completely like  Cooted or hammer drunk or something  Like  Something didn't sound right with him  I think that's just  Bob  He was  Completely sober  As far as I could tell  I interacted with him  During the breaks and stuff 
[00:23:00]  And  Yeah there was nothing wrong with him  But  He's got that sort of  Deep  Slow moving voice  So maybe that's what it sounded like  I don't know  But I don't  I don't  Think he was under the influence of everything  This was  Bob Saget walking in  To the show yesterday  Let's go to track 11  As Bob Saget enters  The Opie and Anthony studio  Bob Saget  Hi Bob  Hey  How you doing Bob  How are you  What's up Bob  It's Bob Saget  Friends

[00:24:00]  I wish that even for  The guy in the audience  With his arms folded  That's nice  That's the last line  But what you don't say right  I said before that  Was cancer  And the opening line  Of the book  Cock  It's delicious  Oh Jesus  Call me Ishmael's cock  Was the beginning  I think  I'm proud of it  You guys actually like it  Are we in it  Uh  That's a no  Oh no  Heartbreaking  Oh Bob  Ladies and gentlemen  That was Bob Saget  Thank you  Thank you for coming in  It might be 
[00:24:30]  I don't remember  The book is called  Happy Endings  The book is called  I'm not in it  Fuck you Bob  You don't have one story  With us  Well it's not that many stories  It's a lot of dead people  Oh Bob  If you'd have killed my uncle  Or buried my mother  Two weeks ago  Oh god  Two weeks ago  Two weeks ago  No it was  It was eight weeks ago  And she was alive  When I buried her  Oh that's  See that's  That's very funny  Um  They wonder  Why sometimes  Guest interviews  Don't go so well  When  Listen to how they  Started that interview  Hey did you guys 
[00:25:00]  Read the book  No  And if we're not  In it  We don't want to  Like what  What type of  Hostile environment  Is that for somebody  To walk in on  Let's go to  Dan  Dan in Indiana  You are on the pre-show  Hey Sammy  How's it going  Good buddy  Hey yeah  I just wanted to mention  In case anybody  Had forgotten by now  The fact that  Roland  Was more interested  In keeping his  Cronut connection  Than actually  Providing good  Material for the show 
[00:25:30]  I just wanted to  Mention that he's  Probably a fat  Cause he's  Homosexual  She's fired immediately  I don't think that  Roland should be  Fired at all  He brought two  Guests in yesterday  That were great  He's working  By the way  On having the  Cronut guy  Come back in  And today  Roland's got another  Two guests on the show  Brandon Steiner  Is going to be in  Which  You know what  That means  You can call up  The show  And win some  Sports memorabilia  How is that  A bad guest  Huh  You're going to  Be able to 
[00:26:00]  And  If you got  Baseballs  You can call  The show  And ask how  Much they're  Worth  So  That's coming  Up today  And  Maybe the  Funniest guy  That we have  On the show  Dave Attell  Will be  On the  Opie and  Anthony show  Today  The intern's  Looking at me  Getting excited  That's when you  Know you've got  A good show  Lined up  When the intern  Is like  Oh I've been  Here for three  Weeks  Which means  I'm jaded  Already  But  This actually  Sounds like  A good show  And it will  Be a good show  Let's go to  Alec 
[00:26:30]  In Tennessee  What's up  Alec  Hey  Well let me  See  So  Roland  If memory  Serves  Is on the  Vinny  Totorich  Diet  I thought it was  Testaverde  But go on  Whatever  Oh yeah  It's Testaverde  You're right  And I believe  One of the  Provisions of that  Is like  No carbs  And no sugar  Yes  How in the  Hell  Does  Even on  A cheat  Day 
[00:27:00]  Does  Does he  Justify  Having a  Kronos  Well he  Makes that  He makes  That very  Clear  Roland  Does  It's  Celebratory  So if  You're  Celebrating  Something  You can  Have a  Celebratory  Dessert  I don't  Understand  Why anybody  Has a  Problem  With that  Roland  Has been  Getting a  Lot of  Heat  Lately  It seems  I don't  Know  People  Are  Just  Calling  Up  Out of  The  Blue  To  Smash  Roland  Look  Roland  Brings  All the  Guests  On the  Show  You gotta  You gotta  Respect  The fact 
[00:27:30]  That he  Is responsible  For making  Sure that we  Have great  Guests  Danny Trejo  Was great  Yesterday  Bob Saget  Hilarious  David Tell  And Brandon  Steiner  Today  Both  Are gonna  Be great  And that's  All Roland  Baby  And  Roland  Has to  Deal with  The fact  That O&A  Just enjoy  Sabotaging  Their  Interviews  Right  Before  They  Happen  He's  Got a  Tough  Job  Now  I know  E-Rock  Is still  The MVP  Of the  Week  Because  Of his  Appearance  As the  Hawk  On the  Cronut  Line 
[00:28:00]  I get  That  But  It doesn't  Mean we  Should wish  Death  Upon  Roland  Either  Real  Quick  While we  Still  Have  Time  I'm  Not  Gonna  Play  The  Bobo  Clip  Clips  From  Yesterday  Cause  We had  Enough  You know  We had  Some Marion  On today's  Pre-show  And I  Feel  Like  I  Don't  Want  To  Put  You  Through  Too  Much  But  We  Were  Listening  To  That's  Just  The  Way  It  Is  Yesterday  And  I  Believe  This  Is  The  Clip  Of  Jim  Taking  Some  Artistic  License  With  The  Lyrics  Just  The  Way

[00:32:30]  Oh, oh, oh. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, oh, oh. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, oh, oh. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, oh, oh.

[00:35:00]  It was beautiful.  After 20 years, these children of the 80s have arrived.  Their hugely popular radio show is not just in New York anymore.  Opie and Anthony's showing.  Yeah, I don't show the radio.  Through 55-gallon drums and whiffle ball bats.  You push it in until you're comfortable.  From mayors to mayor.  It was an April Fool's hoax by two radio disc jockeys.  With bottle rockets and bra bombings.  And wieners and pigs. 
[00:35:30]  Opie and Anthony got their hands on the photo.  I tweeted it.  Two men that have taken a box of cocks further than any.  Well, these people will definitely stop.  Guaranteed.  Lift up the...  They've met friends along the way.  Jim Norton.  I have a raging hard-on right now.  Can I please put my dick in your donuts?  And through fines, scandals, suspensions, cancellations, and terminations,  it's the one show that remains unscathed. 
[00:36:00]  Striking fear into the hearts of management everywhere  comes a radio show that after 20 years remains above all else...  real.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Morning.  Morning.  Hi, everybody.  What's the deal? 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  What's the deal?  Oh, I like that.  Look at that.  What?  Nice even increase of the faders with a piece of paper.  Oh, thank you, sir.  On four faders at a time.  I learned this in broadcasting school.  Was that it?  It cost me like $20,000 to...  Did they teach you that?  No.  Oh.  I'm so dumb.  But they didn't teach me much of anything, obviously.  Oh, thank God.  He admitted it, finally. 
[00:37:00]  Shut up.  Oh, my God.  That's funny.  Enough with the plane.  Seriously, enough with the plane.  Enough of it.  Until they find it, shut up.  Enough with the fucking plane.  And it's only CNN.  Yeah.  Because they got a little jump in ratings about two weeks ago.  And they're desperate for any ratings.  So they will not get off the plane story.  Enough.  They love it.  Just move on.  They love it.  Move on for a little while.  Oh, yeah.  I don't need to know about silt.  Is there silt down there?  Is it called silt? 
[00:37:30]  There's a few feet of silt.  So it can be buried in the silt.  Oh, look out.  That's the latest?  Yeah, they got some more beeps.  That's what I heard this morning.  More beeps.  If you get a beep.  Narrowing down.  How hard is it in this day and age?  You go, that's, all right, there's a beep right there.  Let's GPS that shit.  I guess when it's coming from 15,000 feet of water.  Is it moving around in the silt?  Silt.  In the silt.  They get a little beep, and then I guess the ship goes out of range if they keep going in one. 
[00:38:00]  So they got to keep crisscrossing.  How about they don't go out of range?  Triangulate.  How about you sit right the fuck there?  I mean, you see that weird boat.  Yeah.  I'm sure that boat could stay in one place for a while.  That giant front-end boat.  Wacky-looking ship.  With a tiny back end.  Yeah.  Looks like a helicopter or something.  Pretty zany-looking craft.  Oh, CNN.  Just move on.  Move, move on, please.  Move on, please.  Nothing to see here.  Stop standing on the big fucking map. 
[00:38:30]  The long.  But they did realize they can't step on countries anymore.  Yeah.  Because I'm sure someone complains.  Someone.  You're stepping on our country.  So now they just stand in the middle of the Indian Ocean.  Yeah.  The fake Indian Ocean, of course.  What about the guy in the simulator?  There's really nothing he can do anymore, either.  I only know about the silt.  Because I watched for just a few minutes yesterday, and they were on the plane thing again.  And I'm like, come on.  But I saw them talking about silt. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  And then I moved on.  So I don't know if they're doing the simulator still.  I have no idea.  No clue.  So.  Yeah.  But they're sort of talking about the stabbing in Pittsburgh.  Yeah, sort of.  What you do is you take that kid, right?  Uh-huh.  In front of everybody.  In front of everyone that's completely shocked and frustrated and sad.  And you stab them to death in front of everybody.  So then the next psycho fucking lunatic will think twice.  They go, um.  We need to get mental health care in here to try to figure out why. 
[00:39:30]  The dialogue sure is different when it's a knife and not a gun.  Yeah.  When it's a knife, it's all about the kid.  It's like, what did we do?  How did we know?  How do we find out who the next kid is that might do this?  What drove him to do this?  But when it's a shooting, it's all about we need to get guns away from everybody.  Everyone.  Everyone.  Wow.  Yeah. 
[00:40:00]  Does a kid like this kid in every school in America?  Yeah, the weirdo.  So stop saying, well, the signs were all there.  I can't understand why this happened.  Because every school has that kid where the signs are all there.  Think back.  Was there a kid in school that you went to school with that you looked at and went, oh,  he's going to snap at some point?  Yeah.  Yes.  Exactly.  But we didn't think guns back then.  No, but you thought he was going to snap.  Yeah.  Just saying that.  Yeah.  You think of the kid from your school that could have very easily done this. 
[00:40:30]  And for whatever reason, he didn't.  He made it through without doing it.  He pulled through.  Right.  They said he was very bullied.  He was one of those kids that probably got beat up a lot.  He looks like an asshole.  Yeah.  He was constantly bullied, they're saying.  But what about the, there's no bullying going on anymore?  That's been in schools for a while now.  It's not allowed.  You can't bully.  You combine mentally ill, crazy people with being bullied.  Right.  And someone is going to get fucked up. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  My point is, bullying is worse than ever.  So those bullying campaigns are not working whatsoever.  See that great clip of that?  Whatsoever.  Now it's a lot easier because they just go on each other's Facebook pages and stuff and bully.  And they bully.  You got to do it in front of someone's face, which was a bit of a risk.  Yeah.  You got to make sure you could take that person if you were going to bully them.  See the clip of that kid on the bus?  That fat kid on the bus with the black chick punching him in the face and head?  I saw.  Just punch and punch and then he fucking had had it.  Yeah. 
[00:41:30]  He puts her in a choke hold and just starts almost killing her.  He's choking the shit out of her.  Right.  Oh, it's fantastic.  Yeah.  Where's that video?  Dumb chubby kid.  I don't know.  Uh, uh, uh, Sam Roberts?  Sam Roberts?  Good morning, Sam Roberts.  Fine.  Fat kid bullied on bus.  Or something.  Yeah.  Or bully revenge.  Or something like that.  I saw it tweeted last night.  Quit looking at Hulk Hogan videos.  Uh, I think he's, uh, yeah, right?  What?  What?  Fat kid.  When bullies get owned? 
[00:42:00]  Volume 1.  Nice.  I love a good bully on us.  Bully revenge.  Is it bully revenge?  Might be bully revenge.  Might be bully revenge.  Might be bully revenge.  No, that's not that's right.  No.  I would go a little higher for bully revenge.  Bully revenge.  Oh, my God, Sam Roberts.  Is that bully revenge?  Is that a bus?  No, it's gotta be on a bus.  All right.  Bully revenge bus.  Oh, you already have that in the search.  School.  School.  Bus.  Bully revenge. 
[00:42:30]  Uh, fat.  Kid.  Bus.  Bully.  Bus.  Is that, is that the kid in the red?  Bus.  Is he on a bus?  No.  No, that's.  All right.  That, that one's called fat kid fights and emo kid at bus stop.  Oh, shit.  Come on, you assholes.  You're on fucking, you're watching the show here and you're not even helping.  Someone's got to know what it's called.  Oh, well, way to bring it up, Ant.  I know, right? 
[00:43:00]  I, I, school bus bully gets taste of her own medicine.  I think that was, uh, I remember that headline.  That's the title?  That's it, man.  Taste, meta, medicine, medicine.  Watch school bus.  Okay, here we go.  All right, here it is.  All right, here we go.  Thank you.  Go get it.  Thank you.  Why, why, why is the, what, what did the fat kid do?  Seriously.  He's just a fat kid.  Oh, he's been here since 530. 
[00:43:30]  Oh.  And he's, uh.  What, and he's white.  What did the fat kid do that he had to do this on the school bus?  He's the poor dumb white kid that his parents don't know to get him out of that fucking town  so he doesn't have to go to school with a bunch of fucking maniacs.  It's on World Star Hip Hop.  Of course.  Let's play this.  World Star.  All right.  Please stop.  I want to go home.  I can't see it, sir.  Please tell me.  And the kid.  Fuck you.  Pulling his hair.  Ow.  Please stop.  Why don't you go home? 
[00:44:00]  And, and, and the, the fat kid's saying, please stop, I want to go home.  Yeah.  The little fat kid.  Sure.  I see this every day.  Yeah.  I know you're facing it.  Just let me off the bus right here.  Our house just gotta go home.  We don't let you off the bus anywhere.  Call 911 now.  Oh.  Kicking him in the head.  Kicking him in the head.  It's just this, this unsupervised sad.  Savagery that goes on.  Now the fat kid has to fight back.  Let go of my sister.  Let go of my sister. 
[00:44:30]  The other hair.  How about you tell your sister to stop?  Nah, because there's no fucking rhyme or reason.  Who's holding this camera should be killed for now?  Now he gets, gets her in a chokehold.  Here it is.  Oh, hell.  Get the, get the fuck.  Holy shit.  Get the fuck off the fucking shit.  Now he's lifting her off the fucking ground.  By the neck.  You hear her choking.  He's got a lock too.  Oh boy.  Now she's choking bad. 
[00:45:00]  Good for the fat kid.  Yeah, good for the fat kid is right.  I don't know his name or I would call him by his name.  That's it.  You just hit it.  You good?  I have to go.  Stop.  You okay?  And then he says, you okay?  She's fine.  She's standing there.  Yeah.  But he turns around and turns it around on her.  Good for him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Good for her.  Good for her.  Him.  Whatever.  Shit.  Go on. 
[00:45:30]  Him.  Her.  Fat kid.  Whatever.  Poor fat kids, boy.  They sure don't have it easy in school.  Parents ought to do something.  My kid's bullied.  How about you fucking make it so your kid's not fat?  You guys bully the fat kid every day.  Of course.  He's not fat, though.  That's in school.  That's why it's a good joke.  It's his responsibility, not the parents.  Really.  He's not even close to fast.  That's why it's fun.  I don't know if not close is right.  It could be some closeness. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  A woman flips out in a diner after being kicked out for having a loud, profane cell phone conversation.  Oh, yeah?  What is this one about?  Is it reasonable?  Well, I guess the woman had been talking loud on her cell phone for a while.  Yeah.  And the manager made the error of asking this enchantress to leave.  Shit.  Where was this?  I don't know.  I believe it was in Hell's Kitchen.  It was on 23rd.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Really? 
[00:46:30]  It was on...  Yeah.  What was her name?  They listed her name, too.  Hell's Kitchen.  What's her name?  It's pretty close to here.  It's not in this article.  Oh, it's not in that article.  Okay.  I want to say it was LaMita something.  LaMita?  I believe so.  Do they have a cell phone conversation?  Latima Brown.  Oh, Latima.  Latima Brown was being a little loud on her phone, was she?  Yeah, I guess not being in public and...  Amazing.  I would have a tough time hiring anyone named Latima.  Right?  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Latima. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, unless you had LaHelmus and LaJersey.  Latima.  Get it?  Yeah, I know.  I got it.  Wow.  Oh, Latima.  Yo, Latima.  I'm all for that.  I'm all for an unusual name, but...  What an odd name.  Wow.  Okay.  So Latima was being boisterous.  Maybe it's Latima.  Latima?  Yeah, maybe she has another sister, LaHarvia.  Her powers were big carbon attacks.  Oh, God.  It took a turn for the worse.  I'm glad I didn't say LaSteve Lawrence. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  I just don't understand why you would name your kid after acid reflux medicine.  Latima.  Latima might take two days to work.  I don't understand.  Or it sounds like mouthwashes or something.  Prescription strength Latima.  Right.  Well, get rid of that bad breath.  So she's being loud on the phone.  And then what happens?  I guess somebody tries to tell her maybe to keep it down.  Yeah, because it's a business. 
[00:48:00]  So she said, oh, I'm sorry, and started talking more quietly, right?  No.  Oh.  I was surprised.  Oh, I thought that was where the story went.  No, I was shocked.  No.  She walked in and she just sat down at a booth and just talked for 30 minutes.  She didn't order anything.  Is that what Latima was doing?  That's what Latima was doing.  So she walked in, into this diner.  It's like five in the morning.  Sits at a booth and starts loudly talking on the fucking phone.  And cussing.  Pig.  You pig woman.  And cursing, of course. 
[00:48:30]  And being loud.  So the manager says, excuse me.  Could you not do that?  I don't know.  And she left the premises peacefully, right?  After 30 minutes, that's a long, you know, he shushed her or something.  But after 30, that's a long time of the other phone.  Well, he asked her to go.  Exactly.  And so she did the logical thing of spitting in his face.  Oh, there you go.  What a pig.  There you go.  They'll do that.  I've seen it in certain venues.  Who's they?  Well, they spit.  Who's they, yeah?  Animals. 
[00:49:00]  Oh.  Animals do that.  That's what animals do.  That's what a llama does.  Those are hilarious videos.  You ever see people that walk up to a llama and the friend's going, look out, look out.  Right in the fucking face.  And then you go, ah, it's funny because it's a stupid animal that doesn't know what it's  doing.  I never said that, but I understand the sentiment.  I never laughed about a llama doing that.  I just said those words.  Llamas are hilarious.  They really are.  Big dumb.  How many L's do you need in that word? 
[00:49:30]  Right?  Stop it.  Llama.  Llama annoys me.  Oh, so there's video.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is there audio?  Not really.  Damn it.  They ought to put audio on these surveillance cameras.  This is going to be useless.  Not to us.  We do radio.  Oh, is that her?  Oh, there's Latima.  Oh, boy.  There she is.  Misbehaving.  Yes.  Who's the...  Fat lady throwing things.  Smacking at the manager.  I bet she's saying, don't touch me.  You don't touch me. 
[00:50:00]  Throwing ketchup bottles at the mirrors.  They think they're golden.  You're not supposed to touch them.  Well...  I love when the cops are trying to roust them.  Is that her friend?  I don't know.  Trying to get her out of there?  Yeah.  Okay, her friend's getting her out of there.  Oh, now Latima's just pushing things over.  It's the pig.  Holy shit, you fucking slop pig.  Oh, it's just fucking infuriating.  That's where, like, as a business owner, why can't you just grab her by the hair and  throw her through the window? 
[00:50:30]  Just throw her through the window?  I'd love to see that.  But anybody behaving that way in public deserves to be thrown through a window.  Thrown through the fucking window.  Anybody.  He's fighting with this pig, trying to get her out of his establishment.  And she's going down the counter.  Flipping the various things on the counter over into the work area.  Right.  Holy shit.  Who acts like that?  So now what happens to Latima?  Nothing.  I'm sure she just walks through life. 
[00:51:00]  Talks about what an asshole he was.  Don't touch me!  That's my favorite when the cops are just like, step out of the vehicle.  No!  You don't do what I do!  Step out of the vehicle.  Don't touch me!  And then it just turns into resisting and it gets the taser out.  I love it.  What was the famous tasering?  Where she was really cocky?  Oh, she's on the phone.  Yeah.  And within a split second.  Wow.  He's pointing a gun at me!  And then instant compliance. 
[00:51:30]  Can we find that real fast?  That's an amazing video.  Once you hear that grrrr, you just see your fucking instant compliance.  You know you're in trouble.  Yes, sir.  My hands are behind my back, sir.  Oh, boy.  Awaiting your handcuffing of me.  Yes, sir.  My shit has left my body and is in my trousers.  I don't know, sir.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Someone has to find that link for us, too.  Please.  Let me say hi to Jay in Staten Island.  Jay? 
[00:52:00]  Hey, my wife is a schoolteacher in the New York City School District.  Yep.  And if you see a sign with a cigarette with a slash, what word do they usually say underneath it?  Smoking permitted.  No, there are kids in our school named Nassma King.  No smoking.  But it's called Nassma King.  That's the kid's name.  Come on.  There's no way.  I'm not believing that.  No joke.  And if you take the word American and put it backwards, they got kids that are named Nassarima. 
[00:52:30]  It's a nightmare when she comes home and she sees all those worksheets.  I'm like, I don't know where the hell they get these words from.  Where do they get these names from?  I think it's detrimental to a kid's future to give them an odd name that racist people might stereotype.  The worst was Pajame.  What's that?  Pajama.  The worst was Pajame.  Wow.  Pajame.  Come on.  This is not a kid named Pajame.  This is one of these orange jello, lemon jello.  Right.  Come on. 
[00:53:00]  This is what we used to joke about.  Right.  I am not joking.  Levor team.  Didn't we go with that joke once?  Levoris.  Levoris or Levoris.  Bactine.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yo, Bactine.  Accutane.  Accutane.  I know some of the names get weird, but I don't know.  Yeah.  The Pajama one.  I don't know.  Come on.  Pajame.  Pajame.  That's pretty cute.  Prove to me there's a Pajame out there.  Pajame.  Yeah, right.  Pajame.  I don't believe it.  I don't believe it.  No.  Yeah.  I guess there's a big blowout in McDonald's in Brooklyn every day, too. 
[00:53:30]  What do you mean?  That was on 1010 Winds.  I heard that story.  They're, I guess, a school lets out, and these unsupervised, what they were calling unruly  teens.  Oh, did they really use those words?  Yes.  Which we have joked about over the years as being a code word.  Unruly teens.  They come into this McDonald's and just start having fights and yelling at customers and 
[00:54:00]  the workers, slashing the seats, and being generally assholes.  And not a mention of why this is happening.  Because they're like, they don't know why it's happening.  Yeah, you do.  There's unsupervised people that act like fucking animals and completely get away with it.  It's amazing.  It's in Brooklyn?  Out of control, yeah.  PS 375, motherfucker.  So why don't they step in and take care of the situation over there? 
[00:54:30]  Um, I don't know, because it's just, oh, it's just unruly teens.  It's got to be a nightmare to work at that McDonald's.  Why you fucking running?  Wait a minute.  Shout out to the girl.  The trouble, uh, uh, out of control.  Wait, why don't you start with the first line, which is terrific.  No happy meals for these little terrors.  For these little, what childlike language?  Right?  It's like, oh, it's just kids having fun.  Wait, they're middle schoolers?  Yeah.  For these little terrors. 
[00:55:00]  What's middle school?  About, uh, 17 to 21?  Certain areas, yeah.  That's true.  He goes to school after shaving.  What is middle school for?  I want to say 7th and 8th place.  It's supposed to be 7th and 8th.  Yeah, something like that.  6th through 8th, somewhere around there.  I think 6th is still elementary school.  6th is still elementary.  All right.  Elementary, my dear.  Not in all places.  They get weird with how they change that around.  Yeah.  Hordes!  Hordes of wild teens torment an Empire Boulevard. 
[00:55:30]  At McDonald's on a daily basis.  Workers at the fast food restaurant said.  It's out of control, said employee Tempest Whitman.  Or Whiteman.  That's Whiteman.  Yeah.  Hours before a rambunctious public school 375 students flooded the Mac War Zone.  Oh, God.  Wednesday, oblivious to an afternoon lunch rush.  The trouble began around 2.30 p.m.  As students arrived at the Prospect Leffert's Gardens Burger Joint in twos and threes until 
[00:56:00]  a few dozen students took over a back room.  Why you fucking running, nigga?  Shouted a girl in a purple shirt.  Crashing into an employee before tumbling into a window and punching a kid in the back  who had just filled his hands with pink packets of sweet and low.  Jesus.  It's just...  It's just crazy. 
[00:56:30]  Ah.  Alright, sweet and low.  Friends perched on top of tables, threatening each other with fistfights, which never actually  happened on that Wednesday.  I'm surprised they didn't say fisticuffs.  Yes, fisticuffs.  Meanwhile, a softball-sized wad of paper and foil whizzes from one end of the room to the  other as customers hunker down and head out, and another group of boys cut lines of sweet  and low with their Metro cards, pretending it's cocaine. 
[00:57:00]  Ah, we've all done that.  Yeah, of course.  That's kind of hack.  The tiny boy sweeps a pile into his hand and tiptoes around the crowd.  He waits until he's two feet behind a girl in a black jacket and then blasts her in the  back of the head with a cloud of fake sugar.  More yelling.  All this is pretty mild.  Could you scroll?  Pretty mild compared to the more frightening episodes, which happen daily, employees and 
[00:57:30]  customers said.  One of the students brought a knife in two months ago and slashed the seat covers on a  dozen or so stools.  Customers report a recent beating in the children's playpen.  The girl was getting jumped, said Taliqua Thompson, 17, who isn't part of the group.  She came out crying.  Well, because avoid confrontations, if possible, and keep the number for the 71st precinct handy,  they said. 
[00:58:00]  When you say stop cussing, they curse at you and say, I'm going to throw something at your  face.  A few incidents have occurred in this area.  School officials concede, but the students are typically disciplined, are they?  The problem has the attention of the city council, Matthew Eugene, Democrat of Flatbush, I mean,  who probably blames other entities, who chairs the council's youth service committee and called  the behavior senseless.  We have too many young people throughout the city who engage in the wrong activities as 
[00:58:30]  a result of not having access to resources and positive influence designed to instill respect  for themselves and others.  That's pretty much it.  Now, you know.  Why does this hire a cop to stand there?  You know.  How much does that cost you?  Who wants to hire fucking cops at McDonald's?  You don't want to, but I mean, how much would it cost?  Looks like a nice McDonald's, too.  I don't know what they do down there at McDonald's. 
[00:59:00]  They're not drinking milkshakes, I assure you.  People are wanting in on these names.  Do they?  Matt, Nova Scotia.  Matt.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  So I've got a fucked up name for you guys.  Yeah.  So one of the girls I know, she's a nurse, and probably about 20 years ago, she was on  the tourney ward.  She went in to see this family, and she was like, oh, it's a beautiful baby. 
[00:59:30]  What's her name?  They said, Femel.  Oh, yeah.  She goes, oh, that's different.  How did you guys come up with that name?  The family was like, we didn't.  That's the name they gave her when they brought her in.  Oh, come on.  Because it was female and male on the...  Yeah.  It was Femel and the last name.  And I'm a police officer, so about two years ago, I had the honor of running in with this  Femel.  So I found out it was a true story.  They named her Femel. 
[01:00:00]  And she still goes by Femel.  And it's spelled female.  That's great.  All right.  All right.  It happens.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Madison in Westchester.  Madison.  Good morning.  Hey.  So I am a school teacher.  And about 15 years ago, I used to work in early intervention.  And we would always have, you know, these great names, Asia, Africa.  However, my best names were two little girls. 
[01:00:30]  And when I got the list, I saw their names were Tephylus and Clemyda.  Tephylus and Clemyda.  Tephylus and Clemyda.  Come on.  This is not true.  Where are these coming from?  Look at the phones, though.  Tephylus.  I swear to God.  And as I'm looking at this, I'm like, okay, you know, is this really how you spell syphilis and  Clemyda?  Right.  Wow.  They did get the spelling right, but they just put the accent in a different place. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  All right.  So enjoy.  We love you guys.  Thank you.  We love you, Madison.  Let's say hi to Jay in Jersey.  Jay.  Hey.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey.  I'm a medic in the city.  My best ghetto name that I've ever had was about 15 years ago.  The kid's name was Shea Stadium Johnson.  And I asked the dad, I said, why?  He goes, apparently dad was on the grounds crew at Shea Stadium.  He goes, well, I wanted to name the baby where it was conceived. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, jeez.  Because he knocked him up in the bullpen.  All right.  That's wonderful.  I have to drive safely, yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Pete in Jersey.  Pete.  And then we got a cop that wants to talk about this McDonald's.  Cop you did.  But first, Pete, go ahead.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning.  All right, buddy.  I'm a physician in a hospital.  These are firsthand.  I've seen them myself.  So a woman names her baby, Jesus Loves Me, spelled backwards. 
[01:02:00]  So that his first name is E-M-S-E-C-O-L-S-E-J.  Oh.  Wonderful.  How do you pronounce that?  I don't even know.  I saw it on a...  E-M-S-E-V-A-L.  E-M-S-E-V-A-L-S-E-V-A-L.  I don't know.  Sousay.  I don't know.  And then another woman had twins.  Right.  Twins.  She named him Duan and Anaduan. 
[01:02:30]  Anaduan.  D-U-J-U-A-N and A-N-A-D-U-J-U-A-N.  Anaduan.  I think it just makes it hard to get a job.  Anaduan.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Good for a story.  I'll tell you that.  You'll enjoy that.  Absolutely.  I think this crazy name thing is real, because look at these phones.  Jim in North Carolina, and it's all over the country.  Jim.  Yes, I'm a pediatrician in North Carolina.  I have a patient in my practice whose name is pronounced Shethead, spelled S-H-I-T-H-E-A-D. 
[01:03:00]  His name is spelled shithead, but they pronounce it what?  They pronounce it Shethead.  Swear to God, he's in my practice.  Oh, my God.  Thank you, sir.  That's hilarious.  Someone called it on the Pell Talk.  They already said that.  He goes, watch, this one's going to come up.  Yeah, there's a bunch of... 
[01:03:30]  There's ones that I just think are jokes.  Are you joking, Jim?  Come on.  I'm sorry, Jim.  But it's like Urban Legend, where it's like, no, I knew the guy.  It's like, ah.  Yeah, you should have hit the floor.  Right, right.  But we would have only got a couple phone calls if this was bullshit, though.  Yeah.  I don't know.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Mike in Brooklyn.  NYPD.  Check it in.  What's up, Mike?  What's up, gentlemen?  How are you today?  All right.  Pretty good.  What happened to the great names like Shanene and Shaquica and Lexus?  Those were the good names when I grew up. 
[01:04:00]  Well, not anymore.  Got to get a little more creative now.  Right.  Yep.  So I wanted to talk about Flatbush in that area.  It is ridiculous.  You talked about they need access to respectability and all that.  Well, guess what?  That's called parents?  Yeah.  Right?  Isn't that called parents?  So there are no parents in this area.  There's kids living with their grandmamas or their grandpas.  They don't even know where their parents are.  Yeah.  So why don't we spend more money on them to try and introduce them to parents?  Why don't we spend our money to put them into these places where they'll go and we'll 
[01:04:30]  set them up in a sports gym.  And next thing you know, they're having blade fights in the locker room as they try to get  changed to do free clinics.  We try everything.  Yeah.  You can't just throw money at this problem.  That's what it is.  Everyone wants funding for programs.  You can't throw money at a problem that is a lot deeper than just, you know, they're  bored.  There's no structure.  There's no parenting.  There's no discipline.  They get away with anything. 
[01:05:00]  Could you imagine looking at your teacher back when you were in middle school and saying,  go fuck yourself?  Oh, God.  What would happen to you if that got back to your parents, if that principal called your  parents and said, your son used the F word at a teacher?  You would be fucking crucified.  I broke a girl's arm when I was a kid in elementary school.  I didn't mean it, but the principal choked me out.  Bounds of pressure per second, per second. 
[01:05:30]  He got choked out.  Choked out.  He choked me out.  He's like, dude, you can't do it.  See, I go, you don't break the girl's arm.  I go, all right.  Valid point.  Valid point.  And I learned my lesson.  There's a valid point.  Right.  These fucking punks don't know what they're just a bunch of punks, and I blame the, you  know, I can't say it, the Moulignons.  What can I say?  Oh, geez.  NYPD.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Right near the neighborhood, there's these little people that live, that go to that McDonald's. 
[01:06:00]  They're small, and they get picked on all the time.  Yeah.  So why would they keep going there?  And the little guy was holding on a plasma TV, and I asked him to say, buddy, you  need help, taking the plaza out?  He goes, fuck you, it's my iPad.  Have a good day, boys.  Watch it out.  That's a joke.  All right.  Thank you.  He's joking.  My gay.  NYPD.  Check it in.  Jesus.  Little people go there.  See?  It's my iPad.  I understand.  Plasma TV.  Funny thing is, I remember that joke when I was a kid. 
[01:06:30]  Nobody got it.  There's also another video, speaking of teachers, where there's a teacher fighting a kid.  Oh, yeah.  I saw that one, too.  And people are saying, way to go teach.  This guy was a wrestling coach.  Right.  And I guess there was a kid selling weed in his classroom, right there in the classroom.  Really?  Yeah.  So the guy walked up to him to tell him to knock it off, or he was going to tell him  to go to the office, whatever disciplinarian thing he was trying to do.  And the kid popped him in the face. 
[01:07:00]  So the teacher then grabbed him and wrestled him to the ground, and now he's on administrative  leave.  Like, as a teacher, I guess you're just supposed to stand there and get pummeled.  As a teacher, as a bus driver, administrator, whatever it is, you're not supposed to do  anything to even protect yourself against what amounts to criminals that are assaulting  him.  I can't imagine this in school.  Like, if a guy said shit at the teacher, it was like, not even cursing. 
[01:07:30]  If you would have said, oh, yeah, make me, or something like that, it would have just  been like, all right, get out of the room, and you are now in a cavalcade of discipline.  And we were threatened with that permanent record shit.  Go on your permanent record.  It used to scare us.  That's right.  Like, this is nothing.  This is called pre-prison.  That's what fucking school is.  Can you push play on this?  Sammy.  You don't ever hang up on my mother.  Don't ever hang up on my fucking mother.  I did. 
[01:08:00]  Well, you better be with my phone back right now.  I don't think this is it.  Move out of my way.  Let me get it myself.  This is another teacher and a student.  Yeah, because the student's calling her mom during class.  Move out of my way.  Move out of my way.  Marlena, don't put your hands on me.  Don't put your hands on me.  Don't put your hands on me.  That don't touch me thing.  Don't put your hands on me right now again.  I swear to God I'm going to hit you.  You put my hand on me.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Give me my fucking shit.  Give me my fucking shit. 
[01:08:30]  Could you imagine?  No.  Give me my stuff right now.  There's no sense of consequence.  No.  Cheswick asked for his cigarettes better.  Oh, this is great.  There's not one ounce of what's right or wrong going on here. 
[01:09:00]  Like this fucking bitch.  Don't put your hands on me.  I did not put it on you.  Yes, you did.  Get your hands off of me.  I'm backing up.  I have no idea.  Don't put your hands on me.  I'm not putting my hands on me.  Can you move?  No.  Give me my stuff.  Can you give me my stuff right now?  I'm getting real pissed off right now.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Can you get the fuck out of my way?  You're not a fucking pussy.  Holy shit.  Is that the teacher?  Yeah. 
[01:09:30]  She's brawling with the teacher.  She built a fist fight.  And no one helps.  No.  I wouldn't do that.  I wouldn't do that.  All right.  One girl is helping.  This is...  The students are all just helping pull them apart.  Fucking get the cops.  Arrest that piece of shit.  Yeah, the teacher.  And follow through.  Yeah, the teacher.  World star!  World star! 
[01:10:00]  World star!  World star!  Someone yelling world star?  They might as well.  Anthony was.  I was.  No, no, no.  There's just no sense of anything right there.  There's no consequence.  It just happens.  And then she'll fucking talk to her friends and be like, yeah, I'll show her.  Hoopers.  Hoopers!  Here it is, yeah.  There it is.  Yeah, this is the one.  Santa Monica wrestling coach has a fight with a student that was dealing drugs. 
[01:10:30]  Science teacher at Santa Monica High School.  Yeah, he's a wrestling coach.  Right, he's on administrative leave after wrestling a student to the ground.  There was always that one.  For dealing drugs.  The kid's dealing drugs in his classroom.  So the teacher wrestles him to the ground, and now he's on suspense.  Because he punched him, too.  Administrative leave.  There's always that one teacher that could kick his shit out of it.  Like, for us, it was Mr. Takis.  Mr. Takis.  He was a social studies teacher.  He was a problem.  He was a really quiet guy, but I think he was ex-military, and he would just jog through 
[01:11:00]  the neighborhood.  And Mr. Takis was a fucking big karate expert.  Yeah, and everybody knew, don't fuck with that guy, because he'll kick a hole through  you.  Yeah, he just had that reputation.  He had muscles.  Everyone knew that he was-  We grew up at a time, not many people had muscles, because there weren't a lot of gyms  around.  You really had to go out of your way to get muscles.  Coach Cirillo and big, fat Gil Lilienthal with two guys that would fucking-  Oh, boy.  Perfectly coiffed hair, just steadily jogging.  Yeah, and then there were stories that were kicking heavy bags off the things that they 
[01:11:30]  were hanging on, like what they were practicing.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Nice guy.  That's great.  That's a major problem.  But he has a problem.  Yeah, so you kind of knew just-  So here, let's see this teacher fight.  Oh, what is the sound?  Oh, there it is.  Hey, hold up.  Yeah, this is a fight.  What do they expect?  We didn't see the beginning of it.  He's going for the single takedown.  He is.  Right, he's just trying to-  He's got to watch out for that big right arm. 
[01:12:00]  I'm sorry, I'm just doing it, Rogan.  Where's Rogan when you need him?  Jesus, who shot this?  He's taking him down.  He's just trying to take him down.  Yeah, what a terrible wrestling coach.  He can't take down one little skinny pop.  Yeah, there he's got him.  He's got some UFC stuff.  Older teacher, too.  He's tying up his legs.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's got him on the ground.  This teacher is not doing a good job.  And the guy's holding his head.  He's trying to mount, but he can't get into his guard.  I'm just throwing out words.  But this teacher now got administrative leave because- 
[01:12:30]  Well, did they show at the beginning?  Did the teacher just throw the punch or-  No, everybody in the classroom said that the kid punched him in the face first.  Okay.  First thing he did was he walked up to the kid and said, you're dealing drugs.  You know, not in this class.  Right.  Go to the office or whatever the fuck he was saying.  And then the kid popped him.  How do you think that's going to work out as a student drug dealer?  Oh, I'll punch this guy in the face.  Yeah.  What do you think is going to happen?  There's no-  Think.  That's the word.  Why is he on administrative leave? 
[01:13:00]  Because it's unacceptable.  To take the kid down after you punched him in the face?  I guess.  I'm guessing because they didn't see the punch.  They probably just had to make sure that's what it was.  Maybe.  Well, the teacher wasn't punching him back.  He was doing the-  Yeah.  He was trying to wrestle him to the ground there.  Figuring that would be the least-  Tie him up.  There is just-  That's the least thing I could do and control the situation, right?  Oh.  Let's say hi to David in Connecticut.  David.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  I have a consultant out working for me whose name is Princey Dixit. 
[01:13:30]  D-I-K-F-H-I-T.  Come on.  There's no way these names are real.  Are you guys all in on this together today?  No.  With that community, the Indian community, there's a lot of dick shits, a lot of princes.  They're all over the place, so it's pretty common, actually.  I don't know about the shit part.  So one of your consultants is named Princey Dixit.  Yeah, what kind of a company is it that you hire them?  Fucking baby wipes? 
[01:14:00]  No, it's all technical guys, like computer programmers and stuff like that.  Who wants to ask computer questions to a man named Dixit?  Yeah.  Is that his name?  Yep.  That would be his name, Mr. Dixit.  D-I-K-F-H-I-T.  Is he foreign?  Yes.  Okay, that might be it if he's from somewhere else.  Thank you, sir.  One more about McDonald's.  This guy used to work at McDonald's.  Maybe not this particular one that's in the news today.  But Alex in Tennessee.  Hey, boys. 
[01:14:30]  Hey, Alex.  Yeah, well, I had one scenario.  I had just started working there.  How old was she?  Oh, I thought it was a name.  Scenario.  It was a scenario.  No, it may well have been.  I don't know.  But I had just started working there.  I was 18 years old.  And so they asked me to go and deal with this woman as being loud and obnoxious and tell her  to politely leave the premises.  Now, I don't know what I'm dealing with because I've been in the back and I've just been sorting different condiments and whatnot. 
[01:15:00]  Right.  So I go out there and this woman must weigh like about 350 pounds or 1.5 E-rocks.  Oh.  And so.  That's .5, by the way.  Oh, boy.  That's a coin call too many.  So now I'm about 5'9 and weigh about 150. 
[01:15:30]  What sign are you?  What?  What sign are you?  I can't.  All right.  How many shoes do you wear?  I'll get to the point.  I just decided to do a podcast.  Yeah.  On our show.  Yeah.  I'll get to the point.  Okay.  So I go and I say, okay, could you please leave?  And she's like, oh, I don't have to leave.  And then I'm like, ma'am, I'm afraid you have to do.  And then I'm like, could you please?  And I motion with my right hand and guess what she said.  Don't touch me? 
[01:16:00]  Oh, yeah.  Don't you touch me?  And I'm like thinking, oh, fuck.  There's this mentality where you cannot get in anyone's space like that.  It doesn't even, you don't even have to touch anybody.  It's just don't touch me.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  So I can't take you anymore.  I can't take your call anymore.  He hasn't finished his story.  He has a girl.  What's wrong with you, Ed?  Yes.  You talk about the barometric pressure of that day.  Barometric pressure. 
[01:16:30]  You are a bore.  He hasn't finished his story.  No, I was just saying I'm punching out.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Thank you, Alex.  That's one fucking phone call too many.  I just want one really good call.  Like what happened was there's a customer.  I gave him some ketchups and he asked for another one.  So I picked up a greasy spatula and slapped his face.  Now that would be good.  That's like eating one bad blueberry.  Like, fuck.  Now all the blueberries are bad.  We had some good calls in there.  But now one bad one ruins it. 
[01:17:00]  I watched, I started watching Roots last night.  Oh, no.  The original Roots.  I was watching that.  And it's like six parts.  Right.  And it was a miniseries on television back in 1977.  And so it goes a little fast because you don't have all those commercials.  But holy fuckaroni.  What they got away with back in 1977 as far as language went.  Wow.  Really?  And all your favorites.  I mean, I'm sitting there watching. 
[01:17:30]  First, you got the father.  The father from the Waltons.  He goes with Lou Grant on a ship to Africa.  And they pick up La Forge, who's also the Reading Rainbow guy.  Right.  But then O.J. is trying to get Reading Rainbow guy to hook up with his daughter.  O.J. was in that?  O.J.  I don't remember that.  I don't remember O.J. in that.  They come back and they sell.  The guy that's selling La Forge from Star Trek The Next Generation is Sosa from fucking Scarface. 
[01:18:00]  Ah.  It's Sosa.  Sosa.  So he sells him, he sells La Forge to Ben Cartwright from Bonanza.  Really?  Whose brother is fucking his wife and his brother is Mr. Brady from the Brady Bunch.  The irony of them all.  And then the guy from Rat Patrol, Vic Morrow, is a real prick.  He starts whipping him.  But then the sergeant from Officer and the Gentleman befriends him. 
[01:18:30]  Wait, Lou Gossett, right?  It was fantastic.  And they're all dropping in bombs.  It's fantastic.  You know when they're on their way over and the guy says to Ed Asner, do you want a belly warmer?  You want a belly warmer?  He sends in a black chick as a belly warmer.  That's the best description of Roots ever.  It was fantastic.  That could go viral, sir.  That one could go viral.  I loved it.  You forgot when the girl with the glass eye got her beverage spat in.  Whoopsie.  Whoopsie.  It was so much fun. 
[01:19:00]  I got up to part three.  So I'll watch the rest.  There's six parts.  For the time, you could tell it's dated and you could tell it was a TV movie.  The music is sometimes very, it almost seems like an episode of The Love Boat sometimes,  which, you know, ironic.  Not much love going on on that trip.  They were trying to keep it nice for everyone.  Keep it nice.  You could do that with music.  And very television-y.  But the odd thing is it was Quincy Jones that did the music.  Right.  And it doesn't sound at all kind of Quincy Jones-ish.  But it was very well done. 
[01:19:30]  A lot of, and I also said, if you were black in the 70s and were not in Roots, just hang  your acting career up because they found every black actor and put him in there.  Because then the third part starts up and LaForge turns into the father from good times.  Whoa.  And he then becomes, and then they chop his foot off and hobble him.  And then he gets married and has a kid who I think is Kizzy. 
[01:20:00]  Were you jerking off this whole time?  No, it was just, it was very well done.  It was very well done.  You could tell how LeVar Burton, especially at the time, because he was everywhere back  then.  He did a very good job.  It was very good.  And it was brutal.  I mean, that whipping scene that everyone knows the, what's your name, Kunta Kinte.  No, your name's Toby.  And Vic Morrow is, boy, can he play a great prick.  Yeah.  Your name's Toby.  Now tell me your name. 
[01:20:30]  Kunta Kinte.  And then he just, he tips his head to another black guy like, okay, give him a few more.  He's whipping him.  What's your name?  And then he finally goes, Toby.  And broke him.  I think the black guys on set looked at Vic Morrow like, you mother effer.  It's like, you're not acting.  It's like, you're either the greatest actor in the world.  Or you're the biggest racist ever.  The most unbelievable part of the whole thing, though, was watching Mr. Brady seduce a woman  in an open field as he's taking her top off and making that yuck face. 
[01:21:00]  Exactly.  He didn't know what to do.  He's just putting things over her breasts.  You know what he did?  He curled his hand up by her groin and tried to put his mouth over something.  And he put her on her hands and knees and said, I need a bucket of lawn.  And he tried to green it.  That was, Chuck Connors was in that?  Yeah, Chuck Connors is in some of the later parts of it.  Who played Curious?  Curious?  Oh, my God. 
[01:21:30]  Chicken George.  No, I'm not thinking of him.  Chicken George.  Ben Vereen was in it.  Ben Vereen.  Yeah, Cicely Tyson.  Right.  Remember Cicely Tyson?  She was LeVar Burton's mother back in Africa.  But Lou Gossett was really good in it, too.  He was really good.  Oh, this is African Guinea man.  African Guinea man.  Yeah, it was really well done.  The Next Generation had a couple of names in it, but nothing like the first one had all the big stars. 
[01:22:00]  The Next Generation had guys like, not Ernie Hudson, but who's the other guy?  Oh, Jesus.  What?  Who's the other guy?  They had, what, Buffalo Butt from Good Times, and they really went second tier.  No, there's that one guy, he played, like, you've seen him in a million things.  I think he was in Harlem Night.  He was in a bunch of, was Ernie Hudson in Ghostbusters?  Ernie Hudson was probably that.  Yeah, Ernie Hudson was a Ghostbusters.  There's another guy who played Toomer.  Toomer.  Oh, right, that guy.  Yeah, I know his face.  Don't know his name.  Yes, yes, yes.  No close, sorry. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, pretty good, though.  That, uh, showing the, the, the ship, a ride over from, from Africa.  Right.  Uh, was, that was a pretty good segment, too, because really brutal.  The vomiting, yeah.  Just puking on each other in the hole, just chained up right next to each other.  Someone dies, and you gotta just lay next to the dead guy for a while.  Well, and, uh, yeah, that was pretty good.  Pretty, uh, pretty well done.  I haven't seen it in fucking years, and it was on, uh, Netflix, so, again, what the fuck?  It was on not long ago, actually, on, uh, I want to say BET, they were, they were just 
[01:23:00]  showing.  Better than just do it without commercials, though.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, it's just take forever with commercials.  Probably for Black History Month.  I don't know, I want to say it was before February, but I could be wrong.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, we got the food.  Oh, yeah.  We got food.  David Tell's coming in today, and, uh, Brandon Steiner.  Very cool.  Oh, what time is Brandon here?  I'm leaving today.  Nine?  Oh, okay, good.  I'll get to see him.  Yeah, we like Brandon.  He comes in, talks about, like, you know.  Indeed he do.  Collectibles and stuff.  Maybe he's got some Jeter stuff for his final season. 
[01:23:30]  If he's got, uh, you know, stuff, uh, sports memorabilia that you think is rare or, you  know, worth something, give us a call.  He'll tell you.  He had those boxers at his place on the island the same day.  I think he had Tyson, Holyfield, Sugar Ray, Thomas Hearns, and Duran.  All at the same time.  Not at the same time.  I think in the same few hour period.  Like, you know, he probably did.  He rotated them, I think.  I've never wanted to go somewhere and bother people as much.  Fuck, man.  You better bring us stuff today.  I want Duran.  Hey, Brandon, if you're listening, bring us stuff. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  I want a glove with all those guys on it, and I want all those guys in studio taking pictures  with me.  Uh-huh.  Or none of those things.  Or none.  High school basketball player is seven foot five?  Seven five?  Tallest high school basketball player.  Seven five?  He's an Irish kid.  It's really weird.  Seven foot five?  That is freakish, huh?  What the hell?  You don't see many seven-something in high school.  All right.  A lot of six-tens, maybe, but... 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  I want to get a team together where they're all over seven foot tall.  How would you beat that?  How would you?  Why?  Well, they probably wouldn't get back on defense quick.  Yeah.  I don't know how that would work.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You get some Oakleys and some Barclays to just check them and break their backs.  Right.  Get these fucking thug players that just really know how to put you in the stands.  All those guys would get knocked around, man.  Or a guy like Shaq, who's like, what was he, seven one, but just a fucking giant rock of a man. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, you couldn't move him.  No.  Kareem was, I think, a bigger guy than people think, too, because he was seven two.  But he was, I think, a stronger guy.  But he was lanky, though.  Yeah.  Yeah, but he was also a...  They were able to push Kareem around a little bit.  Oh, absolutely.  Shaq is big and big.  Right.  He's not that lanky guy.  And then you had the Manute Bull.  Oh, God, that's just a freak.  And then you had the white kid.  Manute Bull's the guy that came out of the ship in fucking Close Encounters.  Then there was the white kid.  John Stockton!  No.  We had a white kid that was about 7'6", that Sean something. 
[01:25:30]  Right.  What was his name?  Sean Bradley?  Yeah.  Might have been.  But he pretty much was a bust.  He was a bust.  Sean Bradley, 7'6", awful.  Yeah, he was a bust.  He sucked.  How are you 7'6 and suck?  Can't play basketball.  Amazing.  Wow.  We got food.  So Dave Attell, Brandon Steiner, and other things.  Stay there.  Relax.

It's the Opie and Anthony Show on SiriusXM.  I guess Sean Hannity was talking about us yesterday. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, yeah.  My Twitter exploded.  He was talking about you, too.  He didn't mention me.  No?  He mentioned you.  He just got your name wrong.  I know.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  I don't really understand Sean Hannity. 
[01:35:30]  You don't get him?  No, I really don't, to be honest with you.  We've done his show over the years.  And, you know, we've all gotten along.  But he's obsessed with me and my political views.  And if you just listen to the show, I don't have the passion like you two to talk politics.  Isn't he just being silly, though?  Like, I didn't hear this clip.  But when he says that to me, he's always just being ridiculous or tongue-in-cheek.  He's not being a...  I didn't hear it.  But he's just ridiculous.  He really is.  We've had very, very good conversations over the years. 
[01:36:00]  Sure.  We've done gigs together.  We've done his show, his radio show, his TV show.  Yep.  And he's obsessed with me being a liberal?  A lib?  Is he calling you a lib in this again?  I'm not a big fan of government in general, is my stance.  And I think the right way is to pick from both sides.  I really do.  Pick and choose.  Pick and choose.  A la carte.  Yeah.  I think that's the way to go.  But that's just my dumb two cents.  But I don't have the passion to fight it every day. 
[01:36:30]  I really don't.  And the fact is, I wasn't an Obama supporter.  He thinks I'm an Obama supporter.  I have to say this over and over again.  When the whole Obama thing was happening, people in this country were like,  there's no fucking way they're going to elect a black president.  People in this studio.  Yeah.  People in this chair.  Yes, exactly.  And you're paraphrasing, by the way.  Yes, it is paraphrasing.  But you were one of those guys.  Not just because he was black or whatever, but you're like, 
[01:37:00]  there's no way this country is going to do that.  And I'm telling you, you could feel the momentum at the time.  Like, holy shit, this is actually going to happen.  He's been in office, what, six years.  So now it's like, whatever.  But you've got to go back in time and go, wow, this is really going to happen.  And that's when I started that whole Obama.  Yeah.  Just to annoy you because you're like, there's no way this is going to happen.  Everyone else.  Yeah.  Because once again, I did not vote for him. 
[01:37:30]  I've never voted.  Obama president.  But Hannity just obsesses about it.  He thinks because of all that.  And I've talked to him about it on his show.  And no, probably not on his show because we stopped doing his show.  But I talked to him about it at events and stuff.  Like, dude, I'm not an Obama supporter.  I don't really support government in general.  So what did I, I didn't hear this at all.  This is the Sean Hannity Show.  Yeah.  You know, my buddies, Opie and Anthony on the radio, I've always gotten along. 
[01:38:00]  We met on 9-11-2001.  Opie and Anthony, they're on Sirius Satellite Radio.  Yeah, we got along.  Thank you, Sean.  We got along.  A little plug-a-rooney.  Yes, a very nice plug.  A huge radio show.  He couldn't get in the city after 9-11 or on 9-11.  We broadcasted that day, right?  Yeah.  And he couldn't either, so we found studios in Garden City, the old, I don't know if they're  still around, L-I-R or T-R-E, whatever the hell they're called.  Yep.  I have no idea if they're still in business, but we found their studios, and they were, 
[01:38:30]  you know, nice enough to let us broadcast that day, and Sean was there as well.  Yeah.  I don't know why we hit it off.  I mean, for all intents and purposes, I mean, they do a wild, wacky morning show, afternoon  show.  And that bothers me.  I'm going to stop this a lot.  That bothers me, too.  So, we were more than just wacky.  We always were more than just wacky.  But that's his descriptor.  That's Sean's.  That's like him saying, ah, they're a little nutty.  Right, right, right.  That's the way Sean talks.  That's how he talks. 
[01:39:00]  I think some of the things he does is wacky.  And as a casual observer back in the day, I don't think people were really on to the  fact that we were talking about a lot of different things.  But between all the, I mean.  With the publicity we got, we did come off as wacky.  Yeah, but in between all those crazy stunts and the nudity, we certainly were doing other  things.  But, you know, when you look back, those are the, what are you going to do?  I know.  Maybe the 9-11 show, maybe.  But all the other serious conversations we had over the years.  Overshadowed by. 
[01:39:30]  Overshadowed by.  Let's have teen girls eating each other.  Right.  Okay.  And to him, by the way, calling somebody wacky is not akin with calling somebody a bag  of shit.  Like, to us it is.  To this show, being called wacky is like, oh, fuck it.  Of course.  But to him, he's saying that.  That just means kind of out there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The intent of the user is not to be a dick.  And, you know, I do a more news-oriented program.  Anyway, on 9-11, neither one of us could get into our studios in New York City.  I already said this.  So, we met in the whole... 
[01:40:00]  Can I just say this?  That's great.  Why is Imus cooking outside on Fox?  That's not Imus.  I know.  He's got that big head of hair like Imus, Chip.  Can I answer to Chip?  No, you don't.  It's hearted.  You should follow my lead.  You don't.  I feel compelled to.  You don't have to.  You don't have to. 
[01:40:30]  It's the right thing to do.  I know.  You're just getting back with a Marion call.  That's how off he deals with it.  Let's go to the phones.  You think I don't know?  Every time I hear, who's on the line, I'm like, all right, that was Edgar in 0-9 that I'm paying for.  No, I don't want people to really think that.  Just a fun little angle.  Another bit.  So, we met in the halls of what was then WLIR, 92.7 in Long Island. 
[01:41:00]  You're copying me.  I said this.  It was an unbelievable coming-together moment for radio.  Because, literally, there were multiple shows going out of the studio in Garden City, Long Island, on 9-11.  And they were...  Radio stations would never do this today.  Especially under the current environment, where you have, you know, the biggest, dumbest people running large groups of radio stations.  All right.  Brothers.  So, it just wouldn't happen today. 
[01:41:30]  Anyway, there were literally wires up and down every hallway.  Everybody, all hands on deck.  How they figured that out is amazing.  Opie and Anthony were on WNEW at the time.  They got on the air.  We got on the air.  I think Light FM got on the air.  Another station got on the air.  And they were doing their own broadcasting.  An unbelievable moment.  Light need to play Muskrat Love during 9-11 to make people feel better.  Why did that track just end?  Uh-oh. 
[01:42:00]  Huh?  Uh-oh.  I don't know.  Who made the disc?  E-Rock.  Oh, no!  Why did that just end?  It just cut off.  Did it have gravy on it?  Why did it end?  Maybe give it another shot.  Maybe you're a machine board.  Maybe.  It's just part of that plane-apart machine.  Sure.  Sure.  And then go to the next one.  Eric says it's supposed to cut off.  We got on the air.  I think Light FM got on the air.  Another station got on the air.  And they were doing their own broadcasting. 
[01:42:30]  An unbelievable moment.  Did he stop it there?  But wouldn't he leave a moment in broadcasting, probably?  Or in radio.  He says that was done intentionally.  I don't know.  Who's laughing?  Is that Eric laughing?  Oh, Sal.  Sal, why are you laughing?  What was that?  Why are you laughing?  Because why the fuck would you cut it there?  Oh, boy.  That is room. 
[01:43:00]  We may have to go to the...  Oh, boy.  Someone is pounding down the hall.  Here he comes.  We have to go to the Lummox camp.  Look at him walking down the hall.  Oh, boy.  My water is getting ripples in it.  I feel sorry for the pothole crew.  Chaos theory.  Repair crew, right.  Sal is taking shots at you.  We're defending you, by the way.  Shut up.  This is where Sean ended his thought.  Because then he started going into the next track. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  So it was a weird transition.  But it went up on that word.  Right.  Are you always talking?  And then he jumps into the next thing.  Like, he finished the thought and blended into the next thought.  Ah.  I got you.  Ah-ha.  So basically, you didn't make a mistake.  You actually made a very good edit for tone.  Oh.  Mid-sentence.  All right.  That's where he finished.  Because then he continues on the next track.  Allegedly.  We'll see.  Hey, Sal.  Take that shit.  Yeah.  Exactly.  While you're in there busy fucking trimming your beer and your vagina hair.  Good. 
[01:44:00]  Breathe it in.  You hipster douche.  Hey, come on.  Anyway, Anthony is the more sensible, reasonable, nice, smart, libertarian conservative.  I have to.  Anthony, from Hannity's point of view, Anthony is more reasonable.  I understand him saying Anthony is more sensible.  He's more conservative.  No, no.  Nice is the word there.  You're not nice.  I'm not nice.  No, you're not a nice person.  And I can be extremely unreasonable.  Yeah.  Of course.  Which proves that Hannity is also crazy. 
[01:44:30]  We share a lot of political views.  Ideology?  Ideologies.  We do.  Yeah.  But then again, there are many that we don't agree on.  But the problem is, if you don't share his ideology, then you have to be a crybaby liberal.  There's no in-between ground with this fucking guy.  Well, tear the tone.  It's always been a problem with me and him.  And he knew from the beginning Obama was going to be bad.  Yeah.  And then you have Ed Norton, who's just funny.  Ed Norton is great.  And he seems not Ed Norton, you stupid fuck. 
[01:45:00]  He's been on your show how many times?  Well, I addressed it on Twitter.  I love Ed Norton.  What did you say?  Just Ed Norton, capital E-D.  And I said, please have the respect to call me Ken like everyone else.  Yeah.  Oh, that's true.  You had fun with it.  Ed Norton.  Maybe I should have had fun with my tweets.  Well, the thing is, that's one...  I decided not to have fun with my tweets.  That's my problem.  The thing that, it's like, I know he knows me, so it's just like, I can't get mad at that  because I've done, you know...  Ed Norton, you've done his show a lot.  Yeah. 
[01:45:30]  But people just make that mistake.  I think it could be a little slip-up, just saying Ed Norton.  Ed Norton, a very popular actor.  Or if you go back, it's, you know, Ralph Cramden's buddy.  It's just a more famous name.  Right.  I handled it just as well as you on Twitter yesterday.  Oh.  Hey, Sean Hannity, stop the bullshit.  I'm not even close to a liberal.  Never voted in my life, which includes Obama.  I hate liars.  Wow.  That's probably unnecessarily harsh.  That comes across, though, like, especially Obama, I hate liars, it comes across like  you're calling Obama a liar. 
[01:46:00]  I understood that.  That's not the only thing you wrote.  Ah, good one.  I was calling them both liars.  Ah!  That's not the only thing you wrote.  Well, then I wrote, dickheads with no brains think if you're not a right-wing nut, you're  automatically a liberal.  They're unfamiliar with the middle or independent.  Right-wing nut, though.  You use that, it makes you come off like a lip.  I understand.  Dickheads with no brains.  That's probably not a good way to start a conversation.  Ed Norton.  After a while, it was just annoying.  At least you guys have your...  I've explained this point to him personally on a few occasions. 
[01:46:30]  On our show, in person.  Who wrote Swanee River?  Ed Norton?  Yeah, but at least you guys got the plug.  Now there's a lot of people Googling Ed Norton because he said I was funny.  That plug in front of 22 million people did me no good.  Do you understand?  That's like if he went to plug you guys and he goes, and that Bob and Tom show is terrific.  Right.  He'd be like, you missed it.  I don't want 22 million people thinking I'm a crybaby liberal either, so. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, yeah.  It was going to be bad.  And then you have Ed Norton, who's just funny.  And he worked on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.  Both of them come on my show.  And Opie's a little, you know, he's a little baby.  He won't come on my TV show.  Oh, shit.  He wouldn't come on, ever.  Because I've explained this too.  I don't need TV time just to have TV time.  I don't have a passion to talk politics like that.  I just don't.  He's invited me at least six to eight times.  I just don't want to do it.  Because I don't have the...  It's not my thing, really. 
[01:47:30]  I'll throw my two cents in here and there.  I do broad strokes as far as this stuff goes.  But I don't dig in deep.  I've stroked it to broads.  You.  That's crass.  Crass.  And his show is...  It's very, very political.  Yeah.  It's just not my arena.  Yeah.  Ever.  And he was a big Obama-loving liberal.  Now he's talking about...  I can't believe there's not a revolution. 
[01:48:00]  You know, in the country.  The government is oppressive now.  They're telling you how much you can drink, the salt you can and cannot use.  Yeah, this has always been my point, you stupid fuck.  Oh, Jesus.  Come on, he's a radio partner.  Oh.  But you know this.  He knows this.  And you know this.  I've never supported a side strongly.  Yeah.  I almost liked Clinton.  And believe it or not, when I was growing up, I almost liked Reagan.  Yes.  There's two guys that are pretty opposite, right? 
[01:48:30]  Hello.  But my problem has always been, yeah, the government's in our shit.  And they're full of lies down there in Washington.  Yes, and...  I've always been that guy.  Ed Norton is very funny.  Will.  22 million person plug ruined.  God.  Sean.  Ed Norman Schwarzkopf.  Yeah.  Is, well...  I know.  Oh, God.  That one hurt.  Drink the salt you can and cannot use. 
[01:49:00]  They're taking bigger and bigger and bigger, bigger chunks of every penny you make.  Yes.  It almost sounds like Anthony.  You die and they take a hundred...  They want a hundred percent of what you got left.  Amazing.  They want the gold in your rotting teeth for crying out loud.  There!  There ought to be a revolution.  Yes.  We need new government.  Yes.  That's what this election hopefully will be about.  Hopefully we'll get some solid...  Yes.  Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Mike Lee, Marco Rubio conservatives in the Senate and the House.  Come on, November.  They keep dreaming. 
[01:49:30]  It's going to be the same shit and you know it, Sean.  Let's get the Dems out.  It's going to be the same shit.  Let's make Obama a true lame duck.  I'm all for that.  It's going to be the same shit.  Oh, yeah?  Damn it.  It will.  Damn.  Cruz doesn't have a shot to be president.  It's going to change.  Not president, but, you know.  I just want a clean sweep.  Get all the Dems out.  Make it so that Obama can just sit there and write out the rest of his fucking miserable, 
[01:50:00]  disastrous term.  It's not pretty, but I'll say it again.  I was never an Obama supporter.  I just knew that the country was going to do that and vote him in.  Vote in your boy?  It's your boy Obama, right?  Good one.  Sam Roberts lobbing some shells across your bow right there, Opus.  What did Sam say here?  What did you say?  What did Sam hear?  What did you say?  Hold on.  I just wanted to reiterate the worst statement in radio history.  What did Sam hear? 
[01:50:30]  What did you say?  I was wrong on every word.  No one has ever been more consistently wrong with a string of words.  Sam was saying it was Opus' boy.  So, there you go.  It wasn't, I mean, that bad, obviously, but it was still like, it's just annoying.  Yeah.  It wouldn't be annoying if I didn't sit with the guy and explain to him exactly my stance  on shit.  He loves giving you a good ribbing like that. 
[01:51:00]  Because he doesn't understand why I woke up on a show and it has nothing to do with  him.  I do like the guy.  He is one of the few in radio that's stuck up for us.  And he also is one of the few radio guys that called me personally to basically tell  me that we got to calm our shit the fuck down.  Yeah, that's true.  Because when we first got back to satellite, we were out of control right away.  And I remember, and then we got in trouble.  I think it was the homeless guy.  The homeless Charlie thing made some big headlines. 
[01:51:30]  And Sean, and I respect him to this day for it, he called me.  What are you doing?  What?  He was like, what are you doing?  And he said, what are you guys doing?  Yeah.  You just sat out over two years.  You're back.  You've got to fucking calm the fuck down.  Whoops.  So.  Yeah.  But the reason I don't go on his show is because I just don't have the passion to talk  politics on that level.  I just don't.  I'd go on with you and fool around a little bit maybe, but I don't know.  There are some shows he does that aren't heavily political leaning if something's happening 
[01:52:00]  that day, maybe, you know, entertainment wise, or he's got a panel on that's a little more  goofy or something.  So, yeah.  And then there's, you know, the hardcore political shows for the most part.  I always find, even with the political stuff, I try to find the angle that I relate to.  Right.  Because I don't, I can't sit there and debate politics with, even, you know, whether Democrats  are, but guys who do that for a living.  Yeah.  They're doing it every day. 
[01:52:30]  They're talking head guys.  Right.  I'm going to, I'm going to lose those debates because they know how to say it quick.  And they have everything memorized and all the stats and everything.  Yeah.  So I just use it as a platform to fuck around.  Like, and I make a point.  Right.  Regardless of what their point is.  And try to be funny with it.  And be funny.  Yeah.  Nothing worse than being on one of those shows and you make like a, a passionate statement  about something and then they just nail you with all sorts of stats and dates and names.  Yeah.  But, well, I was just having fun. 
[01:53:00]  Well, I just thought it was a good idea that we would do that.  Ed Norton.  Well, what about the Blah Blah Act from 1949?  Exactly.  Oh, that one.  Right.  Yeah.  That slipped my mind.  Do you realize that 57,000 people would be affected by what you just said?  Yeah.  That slipped my mind.  Yeah.  Senator Glunson, a Republican, signed the vaccine.  Senator Glunson.  I didn't vote for him. 
[01:53:30]  Yes.  I did vote for him.  You do turn it to Brian Rink.  But I thought.  I thought.  But I thought.  See, but I thought it was a good thing.  But I thought free Pop-Tarts would be a good thing.  I thought the people would rally around it.  Right.  I thought they'd rally around it.  Rally.  The big yellow one is the Democrat.  Right.  Yeah.  I guess I made my stupid point, but.  Yeah.  He's Sean. 
[01:54:00]  He's Sean.  You know?  He's Sean Hannity.  A dickhead with no brain.  Damn.  Yes.  Yes, Sam.  Reiterate it.  They heard you the first time.  Don't worry.  Damn.  Well, you said it once.  No, you said it twice.  You brought up my other tweet.  Oh.  That is true.  So you referred to dickhead twice.  Hold on.  What?  Just looking at Twitter.  Oh.  Why?  No reason.  Why would you do that?  Why would you do that? 
[01:54:30]  I barely look.  I look.  Here's a video.  I'm selling a shirt.  And here's us with a celebrity.  Bye.  I realize.  That's what it's become now.  I had jumped back into the racial discussion fray of late.  And then it just always turns into a rehashing of the Trayvon and Zimmerman thing.  And it's like, that's done.  Enough already.  Then I get roped in.  You do get roped in, huh?  I get roped in and start going off on it. 
[01:55:00]  Because people just, they're deniers of fact.  And you just want to set them straight.  And a lot of times I do use some people as a means to an end.  You know, it's easier for me to answer something to discuss it than it would be to just throw it out there as a here.  It's better to just answer somebody else's statement with something.  But why would you argue with people that, you know, obviously don't like you or your stance and you know you'll never turn them?  I can't be bothered with that anymore. 
[01:55:30]  I know there's people out there that simply don't like me.  And I'm like, why am I arguing with these people?  They're never going to like me.  I could cure cancer and they would find a problem with that.  I think it's because I can get my word out there.  I can get my opinion out there.  I can get another discussion started maybe with people that, you know, are a little more adept to debating.  But in order to get it started, I need that jumping off point.  And sometimes it's some asshole with two followers that, you know, that makes sense giving shit. 
[01:56:00]  That certainly makes sense.  It's like, oh, wait, maybe if I explain it to this guy, you know, you never change it.  Of course not.  That's funny.  And when you realize that, it's very freeing.  Yeah.  Sometimes I don't have the time or ambition to do anything and argue with somebody.  So I'll just retweet them knowing that the listeners will just destroy them.  So I'm just like, yeah, let me retweet that.  And you guys have a little fun.  It's like when I'm having a sandwich and I give a little piece of cheese to Beavis. 
[01:56:30]  Here you go.  Here you go.  There's people on Twitter.  Sean Hannity, you owe Jim Norton an apology and you should plug all of his appearances for the next six months.  Signed Jim Norton.  Yes.  Yes.  My favorite.  And Pete Hoare said, Jim Norton, maybe Ed Norton, Sean just meant erectile dysfunction, Norton, in which case he nailed it.  It's not true sometimes.  Sometimes.  That's funny.  Can we get Dennis Falcone in here for a second? 
[01:57:00]  Hollywood Denny Falcone?  Well, I have to.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  He's the one who's walking by dressed a certain way just to get noticed.  You know why?  You didn't see what he did today to do exactly that?  Yeah, of course.  That's what I'm saying.  Why?  You know what it is?  I think it's because he's dying.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  I think it's because he's done a couple of our shows, the pre-show and the after-show and stuff.  And maybe people are starting to know his name.  He's got to be a little undercover, a little cutie.  He's got sunglasses on today.  He is, isn't he?  He's got sunglasses and he's walking around and he had to walk by our area. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  When we went to break, by the way.  Yeah.  So Jimmy's absolutely right.  And I'm thinking he had some kind of eye surgery, cataract surgery or something.  Here he comes.  And you know what the glasses are?  They're like the ones Denunzio was wearing in Caddyshack at the pool.  They're just the worst sunglasses ever.  His big mirror sunglasses.  Very good.  Denunzio.  Denunzio is a boob.  Oh, of course he was.  Of course he was.  Hey, mama.  Here he comes.  Look at this. 
[01:58:00]  The sunglasses are horrendous.  Wow, those are pretty good.  That's great.  You truly have reached a new level of ass dump.  It's Brundle Falcon.  No, I just got these in and I wanted to see if I could walk around with them.  They're very dark.  Yeah, they are.  I should practice it in the fucking subway.  See if you can find the edge.  But there's a lot of hallways around here.  Why did you pick our area?  To get noticed, right?  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  Of course.  Why not?  I can't argue with that.  If I get your opinion, then I know they're awful.  They're horrendous.  Take them off like our part of the wire. 
[01:58:30]  Everybody else is going to say, oh, they're nice.  They're fun.  No, I'll come to you guys and I get the truth.  You told me outside the studio you thought they were nice.  What if they're going to be good for giveaways?  Why are they fun?  This is the company that makes them.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I got them at the DJ show in Atlantic City.  They sent them to me.  Oh, the DJ show.  You could bounce some lasers off of those mirrors and they would look cool.  These are pretty cool.  This is like when you play EDM music, you know?  Electronic dance music.  Yeah.  You know how you just graduated from fucking Apex Tech and you're going for a welding job?  I can't phone you because I'm a douche. 
[01:59:00]  See, then you could look at me and then you could comb your hair on the glasses.  These are perfectly mirror sunglasses.  They don't fit to any head, though.  Those are good.  We'll get some of these, you know, for the parties.  I've got an $8 million camera next to me and I'm fucking using my iPhone to take a picture of this.  You look like a little girl wearing her mother's sunglasses with one of Joan Crawford's kids, trying to be like mommy.  How many did you get?  What's that?  How many?  Oh, you could buy like by the dozen, so I'll probably buy like 12 dozen. 
[01:59:30]  That would be like 144.  144, yeah.  You buy a lot of them and what, hand them out at parties and stuff?  Oh, okay.  How much?  See, now I get it.  How much are they?  I think they're like a buck a pair, $2 a pair.  It depends.  Yeah, ripped off.  No, these are good.  Yeah.  You know what?  Then you could, uh...  They're not good.  You could be at a party, right?  You're DJing at a party, right?  They're fucking horrendous.  And I bet it's like, uh, uh, go get yourself some cheap sunglasses.  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  And then you'd be like, okay, everybody, we got the cheap sunglasses coming out.  What?  No. 
[02:00:00]  Old time rock and roll.  Oh, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Oh, I got it.  And then you do the dance, you know?  Right.  What about my future's so...  So bright.  Timbuk 3.  Timbuk 3.  Right, I gotta wear shades.  I gotta wear shades.  There's a bunch of sunglass-based songs that you can...  Cory Hart, I wear my sunglasses at night.  At night?  Yeah.  So I can, so I can.  Do you go a little vaguer, like Hazy Shade of Winter or something?  Oh, because they're shades, you know?  That's a good one.  That's sort of depressing, too.  You want to keep the party up.  You want to keep the party up. 
[02:00:30]  Good times and fun.  Good times and great oldies.  Good times, great oldies.  Keep the party pumping.  You like that Arnold Schwarzenegger character, the douche-inator?  I'll be bluff.  I like the whole Sean Hannity bit this morning.  You did?  Oh, that's hilarious.  I'll be bluff.  That was fun. 
[02:01:00]  Why was that fun?  Because he was talking about the old studios and everything.  Oh, yeah.  See, that's what he likes.  Oh, he liked the radio angle.  Yeah, he's talking about that stuff.  Yeah.  But, you know, I'm like, with Hopi, I can't talk to politics either.  No, huh?  No.  I can get on there and talk some radio.  If they need a radio expert, I think you're a go-to guy.  I could talk some politics.  You can't talk any.  No, not at all.  Okay.  There's a difference.  No, I admit that.  Thank you.  I admit that.  You know what you know?  The politics of fun.  Politics of dancing.  The politics of dancing.  Good song.  The politics of feeling good. 
[02:01:30]  132 beats a minute.  You can mix that puppy in and keep the dance floor hopping all night long.  Alex, I'll take things people should be shot for saying for a thousand.  We hear politics of dancing now.  Politics of dancing.  That's a good song.  Talk this up for us and then get the fuck out of here.  Oh, it is a great song.  Oh, they're great.  I like those.  Those are hilarious.  Yeah, what's...  Politics of dancing.  I'd like to give them a green version. 
[02:02:00]  I hope you're getting a massage and you're looking through them.  What happened?  Just dropping some beats in there.  Yeah.  I got it started like this.  Yes.  We would cut this out.  We would cut this out.  We would edit this out.  Yeah, it's not fun.  No.  You need the full, you know, the whole thing.  Well, here it is.  We're one day away from the weekend.  Almost ready to reach around, slap yourself on the back and say,  Hey, Friday is on the horizon. 
[02:02:30]  But you know what?  Thursday is also the unofficial start of the weekend.  We're finally getting some sunshine.  We're finally getting that feel.  So you know what?  Let's get everybody out there on the dance floor.  Get those hands up in the air.  Wave them like you just don't care.  Because we could talk politics all day in online blogs.  Ah, you're wordy.  You got stepped on.  No, no, no.  And then it's still going.  It's still going.  Your voice is thin.  All right, dog.  What the hell?  You think he's a thin voice?  Yeah, it's very thin.  It's still going.  His fucking voice is like tracing paper. 
[02:03:00]  That's one intro right there.  It's horrible.  Fucking onion paper voice.  Hey, lambskin condom voice.  Got to get some balls behind that voice.  I'm going to go out and smoke a pack of camels and come back to the studio, okay?  Let me hear your defense voice.  All radio guys can, like, you know, bring it down a little bit.  Then there with the processing.  I like to stand up.  It sounds boss jock-ish.  Boss jock.  Yeah.  Well, I have a pretty deep voice.  No, you don't even have close to a deep voice.  You don't.  Yeah.  What song?  What song you want to say?  Yeah, you're the host of W. Progeria. 
[02:03:30]  Do we have anybody on the birthday list celebrating a birthday today?  We have Brian Setzer.  There you go.  I have Stray Cats.  Let's do this.  We could rock this town.  All right, let's do rock this town.  I want to hear your deepest radio voice.  We have to get the Stray Cats on.  Yeah.  Don't worry, we're getting it.  The Straw Hats, as we used to say, for fun.  That's not fun.  No.  What's fun about that?  Oh, it's just like a play on words.  I understand that, but I don't see the fun.  That's fun if you're saying it while a girl eats your ass.  The Straw Hats? 
[02:04:00]  The Straw Hats.  You did not say that one.  Yeah.  I know they ain't related, but they do be brothers.  I know a few of those.  But that one.  We never did Straw Hats.  We got a request here for the Straw Hats.  Oh, wait.  That's the Stray Cats.  I never heard that one.  What are some of the others?  What's that?  I'm trying to remember something.  No way.  Let's see.  Elbow Parsley.  A lot of 50s and 60s disc jockeys used to do for Elvis Presley.  Elbow Parsley?  Yeah.  They did not do that. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, wow.  They did.  He actually is right, because I was listening to the Elvis channel, and they did a 30-minute  discussion on how Elbow Parsley got started by somebody that saw him in a diner once.  One of my favorite bits that I know the listeners don't care about is listening to the Elvis  channel.  I know.  I love it.  One of those mundane stories that goes on forever from a guy that almost saw Elvis one  time and has a story about it.  But Anthony listened for 30 minutes.  Oh, I love it.  That's what I'm saying.  Those horrible stories.  He's just a dumb guy. 
[02:05:00]  I know.  That's funny.  He's a savant.  Is he?  Yes.  Is that what it is?  I have great respect and fondness for Denny Fowler.  By the way, a little classic rewind gave a little shout-out yesterday.  Oh, yeah?  I told her.  Christine Stowe?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Oh, because we were talking about it.  Yes.  I told her.  I said that Opie really enjoys the channel and said he was listening to the show.  Some of that.  Piece of shit.  Ouch.  Yes.  I was just saying how I respected you.  Let me answer you.  Yes.  Oh, okay. 
[02:05:30]  Opie was really doing a rhetorical question.  No, Opie was going off the other day saying he really liked classic rewind.  Heard Christine Stowe.  I like Christine Stowe's voice.  She's a nice voice.  She's not going to say anything crazy, but she's got a good voice.  Keeps the music going.  Oh, that's right.  Okay.  I was just saying I like this, the channel.  Opie was complimenting her.  Okay.  By the way, Christine Stowe has a much deeper voice than you.  Yes, she does.  In a sexy way, too.  Yes, she does.  She doesn't sound like a truck driver.  She sounds very sexy.  Damn.  Are you trying to sound sexy? 
[02:06:00]  No.  Why is she not trying to sound sexy?  I'm not.  Because you're trying to look sexy with those glasses.  I'm not.  I'm not.  Absolutely.  You're a sexy dude.  Thank you, Sam.  I appreciate that.  Yeah.  Your voice just, like, falls apart before you even hit the microphone.  It's so thin.  It is a thin little voice.  Yeah.  It's just like throwing snowflakes into a fire.  That's his voice.  It does.  It's kind of.  The processing has nothing to work with.  Yeah.  You need something to actually work with to process.  All right.  Let's hear your deep voice for the straw hats. 
[02:06:30]  Do we got straw hats?  Scary cats.  And Brian Setzer's 55th birthday.  55.  It's not Rockistown.  What's the version of this?  What is this?  What are you doing?  This is Rockistown off Dirty Boogie.  No, no, no.  No, you've got to give me the original.  The original.  The original.  Back from the 80s.  Just the stray cats?  Stray cats.  All right.  Just dirty boogie.  What, are we all going to get hungry?  I typed in Brian Setzer and that's what came out of it.  Oh, no, no.  Oh, no.  Boom.  Is that the one they play in the gay clubs?  Trap.  Yes, it is.  It's the only one I know. 
[02:07:00]  We're going to harp on this for quite a while.  Yeah.  We're going to continue to talk about this.  Oh, God.  How could you do that?  No.  Oh, there we are.  Why anyone tries to do anything around here is beyond me.  I think.  You just get shit on me.  Exactly.  That's the one.  You're feeling the tension, right?  Yeah.  Among everyone.  Yeah.  We've got to release the release valve.  Yeah.  It might be time.  It's going to happen soon.  Something's going to blow.  Tension.  Where?  With everyone.  Yeah.  You can tell Travis is getting a little annoyed. 
[02:07:30]  Travis got a little annoyed at me before when I went in there to ask him something.  Did he?  Yeah, a little something.  What was it?  For a blowjob.  Yeah, I'm like, Travis, why don't you just pop this puppy into your mouth and earn a few  bucks?  All of a sudden, he's like, I've got work to do.  Yeah.  Sal took shots at Iraq.  Iraq took shots back.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, I said, hi, Iraq.  How are you?  He told me to go fuck myself.  Right.  You're dead.  Yes.  It's quite tense around here.  It is, right?  Yes.  Maybe.  Why is that, Sam?  I don't know why it is.  But it'll reach a breaking point. 
[02:08:00]  Why?  What's going on?  Yeah, tell us.  I don't know.  The Lamoxity of Iraq, I think.  All right, let's go with the Stray Cats.  We're going to try to hear Dennis Falcone's deepest voice for radio.  Well, good morning.  I'd like to wish you a very, very happy birthday.  That's my voice.  I am what I am.  That's my voice.  We told you to try to do your deepest voice.  Don't talk like that.  I mean, this is my voice.  Yes, but this is my voice.  You dress like you start in Papillon.  I don't like this shirt.  But if the bit is... 
[02:08:30]  It's like old prison.  You want me to put a voice?  I don't have that voice.  This is my voice, though.  Yeah, hey.  Then tell us you can't do the bit.  The bit is Dennis Falcone trying to do his deepest radio voice.  So you go, okay.  We set the whole thing up, which took five to seven minutes.  And then you just did your regular voice.  Yeah.  Is there a waffer-thin voice?  Pizza garbage.  Sorry, guys.  Okay.  There you go.  I'm going to try it down low like this.  There's nothing there.  There's nothing there.  Just a piece of voice.  See, I would just be more happy and excited to say, hey, if you see Brian Setzer today, 
[02:09:00]  wish him a happy birthday.  He is 55 years young.  The pride of Massapequa Long Island.  Let's rock this town.  All right.  You can hit a post.  That was nice.  Yeah, exactly.  I'll give you that.  You can hit a post.  You have a very good radio voice.  I do all right.  I had a horrendous Long Island accent when I first started this crowd.  I've got to tell you something, though.  He's got the right voice for what he does.  That deep voice doesn't work when you're doing that.  That progressive FM radio is for the deep voice. 
[02:09:30]  He's doing the party.  Hey, everybody.  When I listen to a music station, I don't want to hear a willy-nilly voice.  You don't want willy-nilly voice.  Well, you don't even think he's going to survive to the post without running out of air.  That's little parrot lungs.  What else did you say there that bothered me?  Oh, if you see Brian Setzer.  Who's going to see him?  Who's going to see him?  It's exactly when DJ said that. 
[02:10:00]  Hey, if you happen to run into Brian Setzer today.  But these people aren't going to run into Billy Joel on his birthday or whatever.  You never know.  Yeah, you hunk of shit.  That's just the fun thing.  If they have a...  Hey, this guy said I run into him.  It isn't fun.  They're right.  If you see the piano, man.  That's right.  Yeah.  You're just...  And you're acting like Captain Jack.  Oh, fucking boo-a-roo.  And the funny thing is, if you did see someone like that and try to wish him a happy birthday,  you'd probably get punched in the face by one of his crew.  Yeah.  Stay away.  No, he was very nice.  I sat next to him in a Mets game once. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, Brian Setzer?  Yeah, up in the press box.  One box next to me was Richard Nixon and the other box.  Yeah.  How about that?  Richard Nixon, myself, and Brian Setzer.  I wish you were next to Kenny on the way to the fucking mart.  On the trade note of the trademarked.  You just lied there, too.  I'm not lying.  I'm not kidding you.  You didn't sit next to him.  There was three different press boxes.  I'm not lying to you.  So that's not sitting next to him.  Yes.  He's in the next section.  You're in the same building.  No, we were in a press box.  You could see him.  That's a lot different than what you said I sat next to him.  What was Nixon doing there? 
[02:11:00]  Why didn't you say hi to him?  Watching the ball game.  Did you say hi to him?  It was 86.  Shea Stadium, 86.  Why was he in New York?  I don't know.  I was in San Clemente, home of the Western White House.  And this thin-voiced man was sitting next to me.  He wanted to keep his eye on the Jews.  Yes.  Hey.  Are you a Jew?  Jew boy?  Oh, wow.  You didn't sit next to Brian Seltzer.  Seltzer.  See, that would have been funny.  Brian Seltzer, he did sit next to him. 
[02:11:30]  He's taking that one.  See, that's funny.  I'm going to take that one.  Brian Seltzer, everybody.  Brian Seltzer, no.  And then you're ruffling the paper.  Seltzer?  Seltzer.  Seltzer.  Seltzer, Seltzer.  He was in a press box next to you.  Right.  That's not sitting next to him.  So you don't know if he was nice or not?  No, he was.  How do you know?  I waved to him, and then when we walked out at the end of the game, I said, hey, you know, I'm  from the South Shore of Long Island, too.  He goes, yeah, where about?  And I said, I grew up at Seaford.  No kidding.  Oh.  Yeah.  And I said, hey, remember hanging out at the OBI?  Yeah.  He goes, I used to play the OBI.  Oh, my God.  He said, let's go out for some Seaford. 
[02:12:00]  Hey, nothing better.  See, I like that Seaford.  Of course you do.  Nothing better than small talk.  Exactly.  With a thin-voiced man.  Exactly.  If I thought you were a sick kid, they brought to the game.  Pretty serious.  Did you, uh...  Wow, that was pretty good.  Did you get a picture?  No, no.  No, huh?  No.  Now, why would you?  And Nixon's there.  Why would you talk to Nixon?  Well, because he's nowhere near him.  Tricky dick.  You could see him just like everyone else.  Did you try to get as much information about yourself out as you could about radio and  everything? 
[02:12:30]  No.  Like, hey, I'm on the radio.  Just make some small talk.  Yeah.  Some chit-chat.  She's got big tits.  Wow.  Aren't they amazingly fucking...  Look good shaped, too?  Yeah, they're probably really good to just hold on and suck like a little baby.  I would wrap my legs around her and hold her breasts while she cupped my head.  Like a child.  And suck them and make mommy noises.  Can you do that?  It's one of my favorite things to do.  This is how Jimmy takes care of a girl's breasts.  I wrap my legs around her waist, and then I hold her big breast with one hand, and  I go...  Oh, who's got... 
[02:13:00]  He opens his eyes real wide and looks around.  Yeah, I get my feeding.  How ghoulish is that?  Feed me.  Oh, that is really creepy.  Yeah, I dig my nails into them.  I think I bite you.  It stiffens your nipples, didn't it?  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, it's great.  So the sunglasses...  But for a dollar, okay.  Yeah, we got them for two dollars.  And sometimes you can get different colors on the sides, so if you're having a theme party... 
[02:13:30]  Right.  Do you get your name on the side, at least?  I could put my name on the side.  What's on the side now?  Did you say that earlier?  I don't remember.  No, it's just the company that makes them.  Shermanparty.com.  Shermanparty.  There he goes.  Nice plug right there.  That's the company that makes this stuff.  So they should give you a whole bunch of sunglasses for free.  I wish you were taking them back to O.J.'s wife.  Now beat it!  It's not going to get worse than that, so beat it.  Exactly.  The news would have been reported so much differently if it was him bringing the sunglasses back. 
[02:14:00]  A tragedy and a blessing!  He cut his throat with a nail clipper.  A little pencil neck.  I broke your motherfucking legs driving once.  That's O.J.  Look at the stuff, you guys.  Oh, light-up disco stick that you could buy from what?  Sherman Party?  Oh, wow.  Light-up disco sticks.  These are the ones you buy in volume.  Everything?  I like that.  For that light-up disco stick, where's the place that makes it stand straight up on the  chair?  See?  See, you're putting your hiney.  Yes. 
[02:14:30]  We should get some of this stuff for the unmasked.  That'd be great.  Oh, that'd be good.  Hand it out to the crowds.  Yeah, have me run around giving out that stuff.  Oh, boy.  Pump it up the party.  Pump it up the party.  I'd rather have Ryerson at the fucking unmasked.  Those things.  Did Mary call the pre-show again?  Yeah, she did.  What was her angle today?  It wasn't about her, but she wanted Lady Di at the unmasked.  How long was the call?  It's about four minutes.  You want clips?  The callers really did not take well today.  No, they don't. 
[02:15:00]  So then we definitely want clips.  Okay.  All right.  Exactly.  I think we do.  But we need them right away before Dave Patel gets here.  Okay.  Please.  Do you have an assistant that goes to gigs with you that blows up the saxophones and  everything?  No.  If people are ordering those, I tell them to please bring them ahead of time.  Blow it up.  He's got an agenda.  I love it.  He's so organized.  You have to, because that saves time.  Yeah.  I do respect your work ethic.  I really do.  But wow.  So then when we put on a good rock and guitar song, you start giving out the guitars. 
[02:15:30]  Oh my God.  Let me see you guys playing some air guitar.  How about we rock and roll all night with Kiss?  Yeah.  And that gets the, you know, because of the whole, you know, air guitar video games and  what have you.  I'd love to bring Jimmy out to one of the parties.  He'd probably have a good time.  Oh yeah.  I'd rather be the guest of honor at a lynching.  Why don't we just play the Marian Call?  Travis has it.  Oh shit.  We can tap out whatever we want.  I'd rather be, are you a party I'd rather go to? 
[02:16:00]  The one where I have to read statements while fucking, while the Cali cartel stands behind  me.  Warming up the chainsaw.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh my God.  All right, let's hear it for Dennis Falcom.  Classic Dennis Falcom.  Hey, thanks guys.  Always a pleasure, sir.  Give him your best today because Sean Hannity pranked out a lot of new people, you know,  cuming the show today.  He's the cum in the show.  I love it.  No one's cuming.  None of that shit works.  Check it out.  It might work a little bit, maybe, but not as much as the PD would like to think.  Sam, we'll just play it for you. 
[02:16:30]  Okay.  So, so Marion called the pre-show, more begging for the unmasked tickets.  Right.  And the Bobo rule is in effect.  No Bobo, no lady died, no one else that babbles.  So that would be Marion as well.  No rambling.  Although Marion's trying to say she can't go, even if we ask her.  I can't go anyway, but why wouldn't you have me?  Right.  So let's listen to a little bit of the phone call from Marion this morning.  It's Denny Falcom.  Marion, welcome to the pre-show.  How are you, Sam?  How are you?  Well, hey, I think one thing. 
[02:17:00]  Opie and Anthony should reconsider and give Diane tickets to next week's, you know, get-together.  Right.  Now, uh...  I think they should, because everything that she has done for you guys in 20 years, they should reconsider, honestly.  And, you know, I don't care about Bobo.  I don't know what you guys got going with Bobo.  Lou, did you have a question for Marion?  Marion, do you think this one last, is it for you or for me?  No, it's not about me.  It's not the guys.  But the thing is, it's about people that are going that used to belong to the show, okay? 
[02:17:30]  And Diane did an internship for them three weeks ago, okay?  It wasn't a real internship.  I'm calling about it.  You're a delusional.  I don't give you shit anyway.  But I'm calling for Diane, and I think Diane should be able to go.  Why not?  She's been around for 20 freaking years, as long as old Queen Anthony.  She went up there, did an internship.  It wasn't an internship!  What a babbling narcissist.  And I think they should give her tickets.  Over and over.  Delicious, do not care that you can't go with your word if you can. 
[02:18:00]  I don't fucking care what you think, okay?  I don't fucking care what you think.  Oh, boy.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I think Diane should be able to go.  You had a lot to have said.  All right, Lou.  Lou, I think you've been putting your place quite frankly.  Thank you so much.  Marion, I'm sorry that you didn't deal with that.  I don't fucking care.  But let me tell you something.  I think that you guys should give Diane a break and give her some goddamn tickets, right?  Right.  How many tickets do you think she should get?  Amanda.  Well, one, because I can't go, so she should get a ticket. 
[02:18:30]  Now, don't you think that there is a danger of her being a bit of a distraction?  No, I don't think so.  I think she would behave this time.  Okay, well, she behaved so poorly the last time we saw her, she had to be banned from  the bathroom because she refused to vomit anywhere except the sink.  Well, I'm going to tell you something.  Maybe you should give her a call today or next week and tell her if she behaves herself  that she should go.  But she really would like to go and be a part of this.  Well, let's see.  Ray in Philly, do you agree with Marion or no? 
[02:19:00]  Give her a chance.  Marion, when she lost her virginity on a train track, her boyfriend or whoever was fucking  her should have just pushed her in front of a fucking moving train.  And let me tell you something.  That's not my situation.  That's not my problem.  So that's up to Diane.  That's not my problem.  That's not my problem.  You know what?  You dress up in a purple sweatshirt.  If you have a people, Diane, take it to Diane.  Don't take it out with me, okay?  You suck.  All right, all right.  I think that's a little...  Fuck yourself, okay?  You go to hell.  Good for you, Marion.  That was a little unfair.  I'd rather spend my time with someone. 
[02:19:30]  Brian in Detroit.  Hey, Marion, why the fuck do you keep saying that wildebeest?  I'm so tired of your fucking retarded ass, too.  All right, shut up, okay?  You fucking asshole.  Oh, fucking asshole.  Fuck you.  You are an asshole.  You don't know me.  I don't know you.  All right, so if you have anything made to say that, you don't have to say that old  jerk off, okay?  Good for you, Marion.  This is not how you want to start the morning, is it?  I don't give a shit how I start the morning, okay?  I'm on my way to work.  But let me tell you something. 
[02:20:00]  Say it honestly.  Have the guys reconsider and give her a ticket.  Well, I think Bobby in Connecticut actually agrees with you.  What's up, Bobby?  Give her a chance, Brian.  Morning.  You know what?  Opie and Anthony, they're just ungrateful.  They wouldn't have this career if it wasn't for Diana and Marion, and I think they should  be alive.  I wouldn't say that, but they've been around a lot longer than me and Diane, and there's  a lot of people that used to be with the show that ain't around anymore.  Who knows what happened to a lot of people?  But Diana really would like to go.  They're all dead. 
[02:20:30]  So you're going to be all fired up when you get to work this morning, huh, Marion?  I'm good.  I'm good.  I'm calling because I'm saying Diana's my friend.  How long is this fucking clip?  Right?  Do you think there's a possibility that she'll get all...  Don't you think there's a possibility that she'll get all kind of fucked up and piss herself  at the unmask?  I don't think so.  I really don't.  I think this time she'll really behave.  And she told me yesterday on the phone that if she was able to go, if you guys get her  a ticket, she's not going to go there drinking. 
[02:21:00]  She's going to behave herself.  And you know what?  Truthfully, Sam, she has been behaving herself the last couple of days.  No, she has.  The last couple of days were internship here.  Well, I wasn't there.  I don't know anything about that.  I don't know if that's true.  I mean, I don't want to get involved with that.  Okay.  Right.  I understand that.  Josh in Pennsylvania.  Morning, Sam.  Morning.  Hey, Marion.  Yes? 
[02:21:30]  Don't be upset that they didn't get invited because D's didn't get invited.  I don't want to go.  No, he said...  No, Marion.  Marion, he said D's...  D's didn't get invited, Marion.  D's didn't get any tickets.  Who?  D's no...  Okay.  We are.  That's going to be...  God damn it.  I placed it.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Oh, my God.  It's so annoying.  It is so annoying.  I mean, Marion admitted that Lady Di is an alcoholic. 
[02:22:00]  An alcoholic is not going to, you know, control themselves.  She's going to control herself.  She'll get all snotty drunk and then do that whole...  No, no.  No, I'm not.  No.  No.  No.  But she's been behaving herself the last couple of days.  Is she?  Yeah, the last couple of days.  Yeah, the last couple of days.  Sure.  Someone on Twitter suggested that we make Lady Di and Bobo film a sex tape to get tickets  for the unmasked.  Oh, God.  You think they would do it?  Wow.  Yeah, that's the problem.  I think they actually would.  Probably. 
[02:22:30]  They probably would.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If they would, I don't think it's a good idea to do that.  Why?  Because, number one, nobody wants to see it.  Number two, it's...  That would be wacky.  It would be wacky, but it'd probably also be...  That's right.  It would make Sean Hannity proud that we're still wacky.  Wacky.  Sounds like some form of prostitution.  You think?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think so.  Kenny researched the laws last night.  Oh, he did?  Yeah.  He's still working through it.  There is a gray area, but we think we can work through that.  Yeah. 
[02:23:00]  Lady Di's crotch.  All right.  Why is Marion pleading her case?  I don't know.  She's been calling in every morning.  It's not that big of a deal.  It really isn't.  Especially since she's not going anyway.  Yeah.  Why is she...  It'll be on the radio.  It's going to be on our channel and Raw Dog at the same time, I believe.  Live.  Live, right?  Yeah.  Wow.  Okay.  So that's cool.  Why does she have to be involved?  And then it's going to just be...  It's going to be a quick hour and a half total.  Uh-huh.  An hour with Raw, then a half hour signing, then we're out of there. 
[02:23:30]  Uh-huh.  It'll be on demand, too.  You're here whenever you want.  Okay.  I'm calling.  Jesus.  Oh, the celebrities coming through will be cool, though.  Where are we at with that?  It better be with none.  It better be none celebrities.  Well, I thought we had agreed that as long as it was slices of cake instead of cupcakes,  you were fine.  Oh, was that it?  I thought so.  Okay.  I fucking...  I love that Wiki came in here and just fucking was like, no.  That was a horrible mistake, and I'm not even revisiting. 
[02:24:00]  Here's your cupcake.  You're fired.  Oh, hey, Donald Trump.  Thank you, Donald Trump.  The Donald is here.  The Donald brought the cupcake.  Oh, who else is coming through with cupcakes?  I wonder if any other celebrities are coming through.  Who else is going to cut off Ronnie B in mid-sentence to...  We only have an hour.  An hour that we have.  If we did a four-hour broadcast, then I could see where maybe.  Maybe.  I'm just saying maybe.  Right.  But a quick hour, an hour, like, we'll go like that.  Exactly. 
[02:24:30]  Any other celebrities walking through?  I don't know.  Who is this that's coming through?  No.  Oh.  Oh.  No?  Um.  Oh.  Oh, hello, guys.  I've got a cupcake for you.  Oh, it's Ricky Gervais.  Oh, Ricky Gervais is here.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah, I thought you could use a cupcake.  I was going to do an interview, but I figured I'd blow the appearance and just give you a cupcake and then see you in nine months.  Right.  That's great for no one.  That's great.  Is there any other celebrities?  Who else is walking through? 
[02:25:00]  Who else is walking through?  Who are Carolines?  Do you know?  Whoa!  Mr. De Niro!  Bobby De Niro!  They asked me to bring you guys a cupcake.  Yeah.  A couple of palookas.  Wow.  Wow.  How'd you get De Niro?  Amazing.  Thanks, guys.  Oh, look who it is.  It's Jack Nicholson.  Yeah.  Here's cupcakes.  Oh!  These are one of his catchphrases.  Oh, my God.  They got Christopher Walken.  Ow!  You like a cake of cup. 
[02:25:30]  Ow!  Cake of cup.  It's great.  All right.  We got a break.  David Tell, I'm sure, is here.  We'll get him on the show next.  And then Brandon Steiner, talking sports memorabilia, will be here around 9 o'clock.  So if you've got some of that stuff laying around at home and you think it's worth something,  today is the day to find out how much.  Yes.  And Jimmy's leaving soon to go to Tampa, right, Jimmy? 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  Any Tampa plugs officially, or you good?  Well, I wouldn't say good.  Define good.  I'm doing side splitters tomorrow and Saturday, and then tonight I got the cowhead roast.  The Stangle brothers are going to be on.  That's going to be a fun one.  Actually, Florentine.  Oh!  Yeah.  Bob Kelly.  And that's the end of the big names.  Cowhead's got to be a big deal.

After 20 years of amazing people with their obscene ability to entertain  on an unprecedented level,  it's about time Opie and Anthony were celebrating. 
[02:35:30]  Combing through their 20-year history,  this is an Opie and Anthony radio gem.  Tom.  Tom.  This is your favorite movie.  No.  Sophie's Choice.  So.  Look.  Well, no.  Sophie's Choice is very different.  No, look.  See?  It's Meryl Streep.  It's the daughter.  You're right.  Here it is.  Here's your movie. 
[02:36:00]  You're right.  Look at that fine gentleman.  All right, listen to the movie.  No, he has a man.  Tom, listen to the movie.  Here we go.  This is the scene that got you sad.  Here it comes.  The Nazis talking to Meryl Streep as she's holding her daughter.  What's going on?  Tell us.  Tell us.  She's protecting her child.  Here we go.  Here we go.  They're going to steal her baby.  There's a tragic movie. 
[02:36:30]  No.  This movie broke my heart.  They stole her baby.  Because there's not a kind of radio camp in Germany.  No.  No.  No.  Tell her.  The Meryl Streep, she's drumming him. 
[02:37:00]  That movie's so tragic.  That was wrong.  The Germans were wrong.  And I'm German.  And I'm wrong.  I didn't do that.  I would never do that.  That was your people, though.  Yeah.  You know.  I was raised that way, but I'm not that way.  Tom, why are you so upset? 
[02:37:30]  I don't get it.  Yeah, you got so upset watching that clip.  Why are you so upset?  There's tears in your eyes.  It's wrong.  Why'd they take the little baby?  It's wrong.  What was wrong about that?  I'm sure he was taking the kids to get some good health care or something.  In those times, things were different, I guess.  You ain't gonna boo that shit now.  Why'd they take the baby, though? 
[02:38:00]  The little baby got taken.  Oh, look.  She's...  Oh, no.  Look, here's the scene.  This is what bothers you?  Yes!  It's Meryl Streep!  It's Tara, baby!  That's wrong!  No!  I would...  I would go fight! 
[02:38:30]  Yeah?  Fight those Nazis?  That's a funny movie, right?  Do you laugh when you watch that movie?  That's funny.  I like movies, yeah!  They're rich.  I'm free, it's beyond!  And they pee.  But they're dark.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony Show.  On Sirius XM.  Love that tippy Tom. 
[02:39:00]  He was the greatest, man.  Oh, yeah.  The Germans were wrong!  Oh, wow, really?  Were they?  He would have been invited to the Unmasked.  Oh, yeah.  Happening a week from today, right?  Caroline's?  Looking forward to that.  Yeah, there's a week from today.  Right, Thursday night.  You like this?  Yeah.  Yeah, Sam?  Oh, yeah, I love this song.  Would you tattoo his name on your arm?  I already did that.  Oh, that's right.  More human than human. 
[02:39:30]  Man.  Man.  Very dated.  It won't kick in, though.  Because we're on the Jim Car show.  Oh, what happened?  Yeah!  Wow, wow, where are they?  Yeah!  Oh, come on.  No, why would we?  Here it comes.  Oh, here it comes.  Yeah!  You see the naked Rihanna picture, Sam?  Oh, my God.  My God, I'm all in. 
[02:40:00]  Really?  Let me see.  Is that really good?  And I already know Ant's reaction, but I'm sorry.  No, you never know.  This is, she's doing a photo shoot for a French magazine, I believe.  Ooh, la la.  And she's bottomless in the doggy position with a top on, and there's something ridiculously  hot about it.  Yeah?  And the tan lines?  Yeah.  Where is she?  Come on, Sam.  She's not really showing anything.  It's just that you know she's completely naked.  Look at that shot.  Oh, my God. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah, she has a nice rump.  I don't like her face in that picture, though.  No.  What about the other one?  She's getting a little beaten in the face, to be honest with you.  What?  That's her right there.  With her tan lines.  She's just walking around naked in between shots.  I would have been the creepy guy standing right behind her, like, gazing into her asshole.  I can't really see.  Zoom in.  Face down, ass out, bottomless.  I mean, the crack is blurred.  The crack is blurred?  Who's blurring it?  Why would they blur the crack, TMZ?  It's wrong with an ass crack.  TMZ does stink, because they could get away with that. 
[02:41:00]  Blurring the ass.  It's a crack.  What good are you doing?  Who was standing there with a camera, and why weren't they covering her up better?  That's hilarious.  These shots are amazing when she goes into the doggy position.  Yeah.  Her vagina is just out in the open.  Oh, I know.  Stinking up the whole balcony.  Smell like someone was eating a fucking filet sandwich.  Cats were mewing.  Is that her boobie sticking out?  A little bit.  Yeah, a little bit blur.  What's going on there? 
[02:41:30]  Got a nip.  Where are these pictures?  She looks all right.  Oh, my God.  I'll say it.  Look at that ass way up in the air.  Yeah.  We'll post a link to the TMZ gallery at ONA Show on Facebook and Twitter.  Way hotter than the Elaine nude photos.  You don't like the Elaine photo from Rolling Stone?  No.  I don't.  Look at that.  Elaine looks pretty good, I think.  She's all photoshopped.  Look at Rihanna.  Do they have a video on TMZ for that?  Rihanna.  Rihanna.  Rihanna's naked. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, fuck.  What question is Harvey asking about the Rihanna photos?  It's bottoms up for Rihanna.  Oh, do I hate the TMZ video guy?  You don't like it?  Why?  That fucking voice.  It's kind of cartoonish.  It's fun.  Every time I click on one, I remember it, and I go, oh, God, this douche.  Well, they don't do it every video, though, so.  Yeah, there's enough of them.  Do it every video.  Every video.  Oh, okay.  Oh, there's the Elaine picture, where her ass is kind of at the top of her ass. 
[02:42:30]  Her ass cracked.  No one's skin is that smooth and perfect, so they photoshopped the hell out of it.  Yeah?  Where are all the moles?  Oh, you didn't know moles?  You think there should be some moles there?  And sunspots.  And age spots.  You're trying to tell me that there's not one of those on her body?  Yeah.  Maybe one of those red freckles?  Ah.  Oh. 
[02:43:00]  Aha.  Yeah.  She picked the wrong day to have everyone check out her photo shoot.  Why is that?  Because Rihanna.  Hmm?  Rihanna blows it away.  Oh, and so you're saying that she should have waited.  I don't know.  I mean, what do you got to tell me?  The top of her ass, you can tell it's a little wide.  That's fine.  And there's some photoshopping going on.  Yeah, it's fine right there.  It almost looks like her head is on someone else's body in that picture.  Oh, yeah? 
[02:43:30]  I don't know.  I'd put my prick right in there.  Would you?  Oh, my gosh.  She has nice cheeks.  Put your prick in there?  I'd oil up between them and just rub my dick that way until I cum.  Yeah?  I've done that, but that's been a long time.  That's a good way to cum.  It's nothing between two butt cheeks.  Not for the woman, though.  What does she get?  Probably money.  She's at my house.  All right, fair enough.  What did Harvey say about Rihanna?  We love when he asks the questions on his Twitter. 
[02:44:00]  Let's go to his Twitter.  Even if we don't have a question about Rihanna, he'll have some fun questions for everybody to answer.  Won't he?  Oh, and Sal, get in here with the text.  I know Jimmy's going to be annoyed, but there's a whole Bobo thing happening that we have to talk about on the show.  We have to.  I wouldn't know, because I'd block anybody who mentioned it to me.  Wait till you hear the latest on that, what he's doing to try to get tickets for the unmasked.  Do you know, with Julia Louis-Dreyfus, do you know that whole thing about her net worth? 
[02:44:30]  Is that the truth?  What?  Her net worth is $3 billion.  Why?  $3 billion.  It's mine.  Why?  Because, have you ever heard of the Dreyfus Fund, that mutual fund thing that for years and years and years, it's the Dreyfus Fund?  That's her family.  Oh, my God.  So she has, like, an inheritance.  She never had a work.  Billions of dollars.  Ah, the rich get richer.  Am I right or wrong?  Ah, you're right there, regular Joe.  Yeah, you know. 
[02:45:00]  Holla.  Yeah, wow, that's crazy.  I bet you it is true.  I think Seinfeld is only worth $800 million or something like that.  He's got to be pushing.  Oh, he is pushing a billion at $800 million.  Only.  Seinfeld's like $800 million.  This one says only.  Here it is.  Rihanna.  She beats everyone, Oprah.  Rihanna.  Face down, ass up, bottomless.  Check out the pics and share your thoughts.  That's Javi.  It's not a question, though.  Kind of bummed that it wasn't a question.  There are other questions. 
[02:45:30]  There are?  I wish he would say, am I a douche?  Answer yes or hell yes.  She falls right between Spielberg and Oprah.  Wow.  That's a lot of fucking money.  Oprah has more than $3 billion?  Oprah's only got $2.9 billion.  And Spielberg has $3.1 billion, so she's right in there.  She squeezes right in between those two.  Yeah.  The hell yeah thing reminded me.  SiriusXM just posted video of the Iron Sheik in here the other day.  And it's so funny when he starts saying Hulk Hogan's a jabroni, and then he says, give me a hell yeah. 
[02:46:00]  But there's only four people in the room.  It's not like he's in front of a big crowd of people.  Oh, God.  All right, what are some of the Harvey questions?  Chris Brown.  Motto claims his company screwed her royally.  Whose side are you on?  Why?  I'm on no one's side, because I don't know the facts.  Whose side are you on?  That's a popularity contest.  Right?  I have no facts on the issue. 
[02:46:30]  Jenny Garth Photog, she played Do You Know Who I Am? card.  What do you believe happened?  How could you possibly know?  His Twitter is utterly worth it.  It's so bad.  Who cares?  He wants people to discuss, obviously, but there's a better way to do that.  People, discuss.  Larry King calls for a woman in late night while eyeballing a hot chick. 
[02:47:00]  It's funny.  He didn't say that when he was on fucking CNN.  No.  I didn't hear him calling for a chick in late night when he was doing it.  Yeah.  It's easy when you're retired and going to softball games at age 96.  Bill Maher.  Don't cross the gay mafia or you'll get whacked.  Do you believe there's a secret gay mafia?  Yes.  Well, what is in Harvey?  Absolutely.  Isn't Harvey, uh...  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's gay.  So why isn't he answering that question?  I think so, yeah.  Chloe in French. 
[02:47:30]  Strip club.  House hunting.  We could hide the gun behind his prostate.  See?  It's up his ass.  Behind the fist, behind it.  Behind it.  Hey, I want my brother coming out there with more than just three or four dicks in this end.  One more.  Chloe in French.  That was an Italian cock here.  It's an old Sicilian message.  It means Luca Brasi hates the fishes.  I was just obsessing about Harvey. 
[02:48:00]  Sorry.  Coffee.  Chloe in French.  Strip club.  House hunting.  Are they banging?  What do you think?  Sal.  Get right on that.  Tell them what I think.  You're right.  This Twitter's horrendous.  So Sal brought to our attention that Bobo texted him yesterday.  No, it was today.  Today.  Yeah, it was only...  And then this leads to what Sam has on Bobo, all revolving around trying to get into the  unmasked a week from today.  This is only 20 minutes ago.  Bobo texted me.  He goes, me and my mom are going to call into the show tomorrow if that's okay. 
[02:48:30]  Also, this is Bobo.  She is out today.  That's why the Bobo and his mom call in will be done tomorrow.  What?  Oh, good.  Why?  Good for Jimmy.  Jimmy's very happy with this news.  Jimmy will be in Tampa.  But why is he calling in with his mom?  I have no idea.  Did he have his mom plead?  I guess.  And he also referred to himself as the Bobo.  The Bobo.  Yeah.  And he has called me.  He texted me. 
[02:49:00]  He said, it's me, Bobo.  Can I have tickets to own AMS?  Please, if you can.  And I said, I don't have tickets.  I don't have control of the tickets.  We've heard the stories from Jimmy over the years.  He can't be there.  He's a distraction.  But what did you find out, Sam?  I mean, I guess some of the listeners still have Bobo's cell phone number.  Right.  And he was in a text message with somebody.  And I got a whole bunch of screen grabs from this conversation.  Right.  That it's really just, I mean, he is, I've never seen anybody so obsessed with anything 
[02:49:30]  as he is getting into this unmasked.  Right.  This guy started texting Bobo.  And pretended to be a woman.  Of course.  Boy, if that gag hasn't gotten him 80 times.  Jesus.  Jesus asked if Bobo wanted to go to unmasked with, quote, unquote, her and her husband  because they had tickets.  Even though we've said on the air, nobody has tickets yet.  No one officially has tickets.  So, of course, Bobo said yes. 
[02:50:00]  Right.  And then this man pretending to be a woman said that Bobo, the only condition to the unmasked  tickets is that Bobo would have to go back to their hotel room and have sex with both  of them.  And then it went further on.  He didn't bite.  Please tell him for once he didn't bite.  Well, you tell me, based on this photo, let me find the photo that he sent.  Okay. 
[02:50:30]  Do you think he bit, Jim?  Oh, my God.  He said, take pictures.  He writes back.  They said, I'd love to see it.  And, of course, I'll wow you.  All right.  He sends back a picture.  For some reason, there's a small fire hydrant in some weeds on a fleshy sidewalk.  He writes, for you, Jen, did you see the photo now?  Your turn to wow me.  Right.  And she writes, sweetie, I'm going to make you trim back that hair. 
[02:51:00]  Looks like a thick cock.  Roll back up.  Well, that's the whole thing.  Yeah.  And there's, I mean, there's a picture.  Let me see the pic.  Fuck.  I want to talk to Jen.  That is so bad.  So Jen flashed, it looks like.  The Jen.  Yeah, I mean, it's just fake photos.  Sure.  Right, right.  It's awful.  So they keep going.  Right.  Wait, what did that say?  Anything?  There was nothing to do?  I mean, do you want to read the whole conversation?  It's long.  Yeah.  I kind of do.  Or parts of it.  Bobo agreed.  He said, yeah, I'll have sex with you and your husband as long as I don't get fucked in 
[02:51:30]  the ass or I have to blow anybody.  And she, quote unquote, she said, well, yeah, you don't have to blow him, but he might  want to blow you.  To which Bobo agreed.  Oh, Bobo.  Well, hold on.  Sometimes you have to stick up to Bobo.  These are hard to get tickets.  Jesus Christ.  She asked for more pictures.  I want.  Okay.  Apparently, she writes, I want to see in these.  I want to see you in these.  Which is spelled. 
[02:52:00]  Panties.  And it's a picture of panties.  He writes, yes, I will.  Oh, she writes, babe, that's hot.  He says, yes, it is one more for you.  And she writes back, do you have access to any panties now to slip on?  Oh, no.  And he sent a picture of what looks like a small tree that was cut down in a yard.  Oh, God.  What is that?  It looks like a small dog.  This penis is a disaster.  It's a wreck.  It looks like a dog.  Chewed it.  It looks like a hairless gerbil.  Like, there's a hairless gerbil in his lap.  Just born. 
[02:52:30]  Those just born gerbils.  It looks like a just born gerbil that you pulled out of the mother's mouth because she  was eating it.  Yes.  Yes.  They do that sometimes.  You know what that looks like?  It looks like a planned parenthood ad.  Or, no, a pro-life ad.  Where they show that his dick looks like a fetus.  Yes.  I feel bad for him, actually.  It's really bad.  I feel bad for him.  I don't.  I used to feel bad for him, but now it's just enough for him.  At least he sets a handsome glamour shot.  Look at that.  His selfie is cool.  His bedroom eyes.  He sat there.  The worst selfie I've ever seen anyone take. 
[02:53:00]  Right.  I mean, his face is pushed back, so his chins are piling up.  He looks like...  He's unshaven.  He's unshaven.  He just has this dead look in his eyes.  He's not smiling.  Why would he?  Why would he smile for the picture?  And, of course, she responds to the picture with the word cutie.  Right.  Oh, boy.  No, I don't.  Sorry.  He says, yours will be my first.  What does that mean?  That is a fat cock.  Mom, sister, girlfriends, come on, babe. 
[02:53:30]  Go put panties on.  I'll show you my pussy.  He writes, yes, it is.  More photos of you.  I like them.  So she's, quote, unquote, she is trying to get him to put panties on.  What is he doing?  Well, some of us have done that.  Right.  So, you know, she's sending just fake pussy photos and stuff.  You missed one.  And then...  Well, that's just him in his underwear.  Oh, okay.  I've read all...  God, it's just sticking straight out.  Yeah, he sent her a photo of...  Wait, read all these. 
[02:54:00]  They're...  Okay, so he goes, yes, it is.  More photos of you.  I like them.  Mm-hmm.  I got something like it.  My mom is home and my sister's room is locked.  The sister walks her home.  Of course she does.  You don't want your Bobo fucking going for your panties.  Go ahead.  And she said, go sneak a pair of hers.  Right.  And he said, here you go, and sent her a photo of him with his pants at his ankles, wearing  tighty-whities and having an erection.  And you could see all the wow stickers in the background. 
[02:54:30]  Big fan.  He's a big fan.  That's, by the way, the best advertising we've had in a long time.  Right.  But that is rancid erection.  And she writes, those are yours, silly, meaning the, you know, the underwear.  I want to see you in panties.  Yeah.  Then he sends her another photo.  Okay, let's see the photo.  Oh, there it is.  He's in.  And she writes...  It looks like Let's Go Mets panties.  Yeah, they are.  She writes, can I play with your ass with one of my toys while you wear my panties? 
[02:55:00]  He says, get it ready for my husband's cock.  And he goes...  I like this, Jen.  He sent a photo of himself wearing Mets panties.  Yeah.  And then writes a photo.  Okay, whatever.  Get his rotten, dirty dick sucked.  Yes.  With his awful gut.  That's the mouth.  There's a lot of hair coming out of those panties.  It's horrendous.  Is that...  That's it, hopefully.  Looks like Dan Haggerty wearing a chin strap.  Anything else? 
[02:55:30]  He writes, next time it will be yours.  I have on.  I like it.  Quote, unquote.  She writes, I'll suck your cock while he fucks your ass.  Uh-oh.  What does he say for that?  All at once.  While you wear my panties.  He writes, I want to fuck the shit out of you.  And then he writes, that's fine.  That's fine?  As long as I get to fuck you alone, too.  Oh, see.  He says it's okay if he fucks the husband or boyfriend fucks him.  In the ass.  That's okay, but he wants to fuck her alone. 
[02:56:00]  All right, look.  He's not a good negotiator.  Who is he, Bob Eatman?  Yeah, the guys will take less money, but you also have to not advertise them.  And all this sexy talk was going on at 925 a.m.  A.m.  And the A.  Let's see.  Hi, who's this?  Yeah, this is Bob Eatman.  What?  What?  Huh? 
[02:56:30]  She's a friend of mine, and I was texting her, and I just saw how she reached.  Your phone sucks.  Where are you?  I'm outside.  You're outside where?  I was just on my way back from the post office.  Oh, yeah?  This is actually better than most of her calls.  You can't hear it.  Bobo, that's not your friend you were talking to.  Bobo, that's not a friend.  They sent all the pictures and texts and everything. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, you're going to let a guy pop you in the ass just to go to the unmasked?  Oh, God, listen to this disaster.  No one can hear this.  This calls the audio version of your dick.  Yeah, exactly.  Sit on a bowl.  Yes? 
[02:57:30]  They sent us a picture of you wearing panties.  Bobo, you're wearing pink Let's Go Mets panties.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, you didn't sound too happy about that.  So explain yourself.  Yeah, I was too thrilled about that.  I only did that for her, but I trusted her. 
[02:58:00]  She wasn't going to make these pictures public.  Bobo, it's not her.  It's a guy.  Right.  This is a guy.  And stop trusting these people.  Stop fucking around on the internet.  How many times are you going to get tricked?  I'm not going to get tricked again.  We won't get fooled again.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice.  Won't get fooled again.  What if you fool him several dozen times?  Right.  Well, I won't get fooled again.  He doesn't even care.  All right.  Obviously, you don't want to go down mass, so we've got to move on. 
[02:58:30]  Thank you.  I do want to go down mass.  I do want to go.  I do want to go, guys.  Oh, we're losing here.  We can't hear you, Bobo.  No, I do want to go.  We can't hear you.  Hello?  I guess he doesn't want to go.  If he wanted to go, we'd hear him.  Yeah, we felt bad about the panties, and we were just going to give him tickets.  But if we can't hear the guy, what are we going to do?  Obviously, if he wanted to go, he would have stayed on the phone.  He hung up on us.  Bobo!  Bobo!  He hung up. 
[02:59:00]  He hung up.  We have one extra ticket, but we also have a pair of O&A panties.  Well, should I just send the panties to Bobo?  Yeah, I feel bad that he had to wear the panties, so I was going to turn around and just give  him the tickets and be done with this, but he's not even on the phone.  Why would he hang up?  Right before we give him tickets, he hangs up like that?  That's fucked up.  I'm on the phone, guys.  Very funny.  You guys are going to mess with me, buddy.  All right, I just...  You're going to mess with me, Rach.  Very funny.  You guys are going to mess with me, Rach. 
[02:59:30]  Lindsay, what's up?  Hi, guys.  I want to talk to Bobo for a second.  Oh, he hung up.  Dan!  What?  I'm watching her.  Yeah, he hung up.  I'm watching you.  Wow, pretty girl.  Are you watching me, Anne?  Yes.  Let's see what she looks like.  Go ahead.  Let's see.  Let's see this bitch.  There she is.  Hi, guys.  Yeah.  Oh, we know you.  Yeah, we know.  Yeah.  Very nice.  You're a woman of low stock.  Yes, I agree. 
[03:00:00]  That's correct.  I am.  What's going on?  I wanted to yell at Dan for being a fucking retard.  I can't fan his shit.  I get pissed off that he just, you know, is so trusting all the time.  All the time.  He fucking tries to...  He thinks these guys are girls.  And he gives them phone numbers and pictures.  There's a picture of him wearing Let's Go Mets panties.  Oh, my God.  No.  And he was actually going to take it in the ass from a guy so he can fuck the girl and get tickets. 
[03:00:30]  Right.  It's crazy.  I'm so disappointed.  I mean, it's bad enough that I have to monitor his Twitter DMs.  It's fucking ridiculous.  You're way too overdressed, Linz.  Me?  Right now?  Yeah.  You're way too overdressed.  Uh...  Yeah.  Where are you going?  I take something off, but I have to go to a doctor's appointment.  Oh, sexy.  Oh, that's fucking hot.  You're going to take off your clothes and have him check you for cancer?  Yeah.  Oh, my God. 
[03:01:00]  Jesus.  Yes, if you said it, it's my cuda.  My cuda.  Hold on a minute.  Hold on.  We got him back.  Oh, here's Bob's.  Bobo, we had a pair of tickets for you because I felt bad about the panties thing, but we  had to move on and give them to someone else.  What's up?  I'll have the tickets.  You hung up.  It's too late.  What the fuck are you doing?  I didn't.  I did not hang up.  Dan, it's Lindsay. 
[03:01:30]  What the fuck are you doing?  What have I told you a million fucking times, Daniel?  Probably no.  Besides no.  Seriously, Dan.  Yeah, don't trust him.  And what the fuck are you doing?  I know.  I was a little bit of in a bad mood that time yesterday.  Man, when I'm in a bad mood, I don't put panties on. 
[03:02:00]  Exactly.  Well, we differ.  I know.  Seriously.  Seriously.  You know what?  I'm all done.  I'm all fucking done, Dan.  If you do that shit again, me and you are not friends because I'm not going to keep defending  your ass if you're going to act like an asshole.  All right.  I'm not going to do that again.  He'd said that so many times.  I promise I got the word on that.  I swear to everybody. 
[03:02:30]  But you can't swear on something that you're incapable of doing.  Right.  Because you've done this.  Bobo, you've gotten tricked so many times over the years.  Yeah, I know.  I swear on the life of all my friends and family.  Oh, great.  You condemn them.  You're condemning them to death because you're incapable.  Well, I really am going to not do anything like that.  I'm not going to fall for it again.  But you said this last time. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, you're a liar.  Well, this time I actually said this, that I swear on the life of all my friends and family.  All right, so two people.  A lot more friends than people think.  All right, well, we think zero, so one is a lot more than we think.  How's the Jim Norton boycott going, by the way?  Yeah, yeah, you're boycotting Jim.  How's the Jim Norton boycott?  I closed off.  Yeah.  I closed off.  Bobo, where'd you get Mets panties? 
[03:03:30]  Where'd you get the panties?  Whose panties are those, Bobo?  I can't say, because I don't, because I don't, I can't say who.  Bobo, you have to say.  You have to say.  I guess you don't want those tickets.  I guess not.  No, I do want the tickets.  All right, well, I want to thank Lindsay from Massachusetts for calling.  My sister.  They're from my sister.  I want to thank you, Lindsay from Massachusetts.  Your sister's panties.  Your sister's panties. 
[03:04:00]  Why are you wearing your sister's panties?  And she probably wore them first.  He probably took them out of the laundry.  Exactly.  Normally he wears them as a visor.  All right, Bobo.  Bobo.  We really need people that want to go to this thing, because we don't have a lot of seats.  I really want to go to this.  I really want to go to this.  It was good talking to you, and please don't be fooled anymore by these fake women, all right?  Yeah, don't get fooled again.  Are you talking to me?  I really want to go to Don Matt. 
[03:04:30]  I really want to go to Don Matt.  He hung up again?  He hung up.  Bobo.  That's rude.  Bobo.  I'm really here.  I'm really here, guys.  Bobo.  Yeah, he hung up.  Fucking guy.  I'm really here.  All right, we got David Teller in the studio.  It's too bad he hung up.  Hey, guys.  Can I just say one thing?  Yes.  Where was he calling from?  A World War II battlefield?  That sounded like he was under fire.  It really sounded like, just drop it on my position. 
[03:05:00]  He is under fire.  That's for sure.  Oh, shit.  By the way, I didn't like Lynn's calling him Dan.  Like, she's the one who will talk to him and get through.  I'll break through.  No, you won't.  His name is fucking Bobo.  I'll break through.  She's going to be the one that saves him.  Exactly.  You're not the Dennis Quaid with this bill.  Dan, what can I tell you, Dan?  I don't know because I was listening to a lamp. 
[03:05:30]  Right on.  That's fucking funny.  What's up, David Tell?  How you doing, guys?  We're just doing our thing.  Thanks for having me in.  You're doing your thing?  You got a new show, right?  Two big projects in the works.  That's awesome.  This Saturday, I believe, April 12th, midnight, the Roadworks special is coming out on Comedy Central.  And that's the special that I shot in five different clubs.  Wow.  And it's not a big theater show. 
[03:06:00]  I know Jim is a theater act.  He's classed all the way.  This is down and dirty.  It's a handheld camera.  It's pretty much what I do all the time.  And I really put a lot of cash, put a lot of time into it, and I'm excited.  I think the people are going to like it.  And after that, right after that special, there's more good, the Comedy Underground show,  which Jim was on.  It's in the vein of the Rodney Dangerfield kind of specials back in the day, uncensored,  unfiltered.  Oh, nice. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  Comedy Underground, it's called.  Comedy Underground.  This is not a political rant, spoken word thing.  It's just in a basement underground.  And that's where the comedy was.  Yeah, it was shot in the Village.  Yeah, the Village Underground.  Oh, the Village Underground.  Yeah, North Club.  Yeah, that's a nice place, man.  And, you know, it was really cool because we had, like, you know, people like Jim and  Amy Schumer, Artie Lang.  People like them?  Who are they?  No, actually them.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  I saw it.  None of them could make it.  Some of the best impersonators in the business come by.  And Jeff Ross. 
[03:07:00]  Dressed up a piece of shit.  I was just trying to have some fun on the radio and be wounded.  And then we have some of the new kids, you know, the young faces, they come out.  Who are the young faces?  Well, you show that movie, Punchline.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  A kid who wanted to be a doctor.  Right.  But then he didn't want to.  No, yeah.  Sally Field.  Barry Sobel.  Did you guys hate Punchline as a movie?  No, it's very believable.  The lockers and everything.  Lockers. 
[03:07:30]  The only thing believable about that is that the mics were plugged in.  That's got to be insulting to you guys.  That's the one movie that people have seen about stand-up.  It's just silly.  What about Lenny?  I think that's a better movie, actually.  Yes, and more uplifting.  True, true, true.  I love that movie.  That movie is great.  That's always on, like, right at that point.  Like, either you're hungover or you're brutally sober.  You just watch it.  It's great.  I haven't seen that movie in 10 years.  That's a great one, too, with, like, The Champ or some other, like, really sad.  Yeah. 
[03:08:00]  You don't make me question yourself.  That's great.  That's how we feel after most shows.  You know what I would like to be a comedian?  Look at fucking Ricky Schroeder and Jack Warden.  That's what it's like.  You're trying to get your money.  Boo.  You know who did it?  Jay Oakerson, Kurt Metzger, Mike Vickie on those guys.  Oh, it was Kurt on it, too?  All right.  Yeah.  Really, really, really good stuff.  It was a lot of material, and, you know, it's dirty, which is now, like, an endangered species.  Yes, it is.  Boy, is it.  There's only a few places where you can actually cut loose now.  America's Funniest Home Videos.  Yes, of course. 
[03:08:30]  Parks and Rec.  Parks and Rec.  I hope there's not a lot of salty language in this.  There's some raunchiness, you know, as the olders say.  There's some raunchiness.  You were very funny, too.  David was really just fucking improv-ing and working in the crowd.  It was very funny.  Yeah.  Very impressive to be able to do that on television.  It was really good.  Yeah, there's some of that in there, because I had no jokes, because I just did the hour.  So I figured I'll, you know, go to plan B and just work the crowd.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  And then after that, I guess it would have been some magic.  Juggling is good.  You've never really seen an uncensored magic show. 
[03:09:00]  That's one thing.  Like, they seem to really not care about that.  Look, it's a rabbit, you cunt.  Instead of ta-da, they drop an N-bomb.  And, you know, the cool thing about it is, like, you know, because I was broke doing  that porn show, so I made some money, and I took some of the money, and I donated to  this charity called Military Assistance for the, sorry, National Military Family Assistance.  It's for, like, the veterans and their families, and they got this cool program called Operation 
[03:09:30]  Purple, where, you know, they send the veterans' kids to camp, and they have these special programs  for them.  So there's some good in the dirty.  That's all I'm saying, guys.  That's all I'm saying.  Some good in the dirty.  Is there a website for that?  Yeah.  Let's make more money for that.  The end justifies the means, I say, right?  There you go.  There it is.  Let's find the website.  So why are you funding trying to close these camps down?  Fighting these camps.  He's finding these money for the court case. 
[03:10:00]  You're right.  Imagine how brutal that would be.  No, the...  Negative publicity.  Right.  No, because I did the charity over the weekend, and there was, like, a very low turnout, and  I was like, what's going on?  Is there a bigger charity in town?  It really bothered me.  So then I figured I'm just going to step up, drop my own coin.  Out on the island.  Okay.  Yeah, and I was like, this really bothered me.  Because usually, you know, you do, like, a nice charity.  There's always, you know, like, the group of people that come down for it, you know,  like, buy a raffle ticket.  Were you just doing stand-up there?  Yeah.  Okay. 
[03:10:30]  Well, what should I have done at the charity?  Well, no, no, no.  I mean, was there other stuff, or was it just a show?  I didn't know if it was, like, a whole...  Yeah, no, it was CJ Ramon was there.  He played, and, like, yeah, no, they had, like, a big deal there.  Okay.  And they put a lot of work into it, so I was into it.  That sucks.  There you go.  But, yeah, the underground show is going to be fun.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  You know, I realize that I've hit that point now where it's, like, you know, I'm so old  now, like, I watch the younger comics and their talk, their rants and all that stuff.  What bothers them? 
[03:11:00]  Like, something like an email will bother them, you know, and, like, I find that, like, really  hilarious, you know?  For me, it's, like, a smell I can't describe, you know, something like that.  Like, what is that?  Is that, like, peanut butter?  Or is that, like, the first stage of diabetes?  What is that?  My urine shouldn't smell like that.  So, you know, it's funny how they, you know, they teched it up, these kids, and they all  have their, you know, whatever, their podcasts and whatnot. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, yeah.  So we're hoping to get the word out that way, too.  Very cool.  All right.  So this is the website, I think, right?  What is it?  Yeah, militaryfamily.org.  Okay, cool.  Sounds like a good program.  It's a great program.  They have all these great programs.  Thanks for putting it up.  They have great programs.  Donate if you can.  Dave is always nice to the soldiers.  I'm going to donate.  I'm going to donate.  That's the whole thing.  It's like, yeah, you guys, once this comes out on download, all these different things,  just don't pirate it or misuse it.  Yeah, you fuckers.  And I'll throw it that way. 
[03:12:00]  I'll throw it that way.  Exactly.  But yeah, if they want to donate or, you know, do all that stuff, too.  Where can you see this?  When is it on?  It's on this weekend, dude.  Okay.  April 12th.  You're on, like, one of the few episodes back.  Okay.  The first one is Jeff Ross, Jermaine Fowler, Jay Ockerson, and Joe DeRosa.  Old Joe.  Oh, Joe.  Good old Joe.  We remember him.  Remember him.  He flew in for the show.  He's now working for Pete Holmes.  Oh, did he?  Left Coast Joe, yeah.  Left Coast Joe.  We haven't seen him since he left for the Pete Holmes show.  He had to zip across the country to shoot something, and then he zipped on back. 
[03:12:30]  Yes, yes, yes, yes.  I sure did.  I don't do stand-up in it, but I have an interaction, which was kind of cool.  Oh, cool.  We put Jim in the crowd, and he's there with Farrah Abraham, the teen mom.  It was a great, there was some chemistry there, I believe.  Oh, nice.  Yes.  I wanted to fuck her, and she wanted to be dead.  She did kind of eye-roll you out of the room.  Oh, wow.  She's crazy, man.  But she was, no, she was cool.  That's a crazy bro.  She was very cool.  She did it all right by you.  I'm so glad you did the show.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  I should shut my mouth.  I'm going to hit the old canaroonie. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, I think.  You going to take a shit?  Yeah, I might.  I'm going to think on the way there if I need a piss.  Well, we've got to take a break anyway.  I hope you don't make it.  Oh, that would be great.  Jim, didn't you do a show like this at some point for HBO, right?  Down and Dirty with Jim Norton.  Did he?  Oh.  So I assume that was even more uncensored.  Yeah, we let the Hex and Dams fly.  Oh, I don't like that.  Darns.  It was great.  It doesn't give a good message to the children.  I love the HBO show, Jim Norton.  Did well, too.  They never give, like...  They should have done more. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  They never give, like, good names to, like, the really censored shows.  Like, you know, you kind of are always, like, pulled in, but then it's always, like,  super censored.  Yeah.  Like, they should call it, like, you know, Golly G.  Golly G.  Golly G.  Skip to Maloo.  Easy.  Skip to Maloo and Golly G.  And then it's filthy.  Yeah, it is.  It's filthy.  We got to take a break.  David Teller's here.  And we got Brandon Steiner here as well.  Nice.  And Jimmy's leaving us soon to go to Tampa.  Oh, Jimmy.  I leave in 17 minutes. 
[03:14:00]  Are we going to road it up at all this year or what?  Yeah, we're doing some gigs.  You want to?  I would do, yeah.  You sure?  Absolutely.  All right.  Absolutely.  Me and David.  It's hard to lock Jim into a gig.  It's all good.  O&A will be right back on Sirius XM.  You could change the channel, but it would be a horrible regret.

[03:25:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show is back on Sirius XM.  Best news ever.  Hey, David Tell in studio promoting Roadwork Comedy Central this Saturday night at, looks 
[03:26:00]  like midnight.  Midnight.  Oh, cool.  And then you got at 1 a.m., Comedy Underground.  Very cool.  Series premiere on Comedy Central.  It's the David Tell Weekend on Comedy Central.  Yes.  Well, I would like to say it's about Mad Men, but yeah.  Oh, all that stuff's on Comedy Central.  That's great.  No, you're both your things.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  That's phenomenal.  David's such a great comic.  I can't watch comedians, and we do gigs together on the road, and it's like you come back sometimes, 
[03:26:30]  and I'll watch like the last five minutes because I have to go out at the end, and we go  out.  Yeah.  And it's just depressing.  It's so good.  It's like, oh, fuck.  Yeah, but Jim, your turnaround now is like incredible.  I mean, you did, how many specials have you done in the last three years?  Well, I've just done, I've done two in the last two years, yeah.  That's pretty amazing.  I want to do one.  Yeah, Jimmy can write some shit once a year.  Exactly.  You said that right.  Your probably, only problem now is thinking of more hilarious, ironic names for your specials.  Yeah.  You probably have a team in Korea or something. 
[03:27:00]  Special names.  That is tough.  This is the next one.  I'm just calling back again, folks.  And the poster is me with my arms up in the air like, what the heck?  It's real.  Speaking of comics, 22 years ago today, we lost Sam Kinison.  Oh.  What?  With that car crash.  This guy, man.  You know what?  I always loved him, but I never really knew how much I loved him until I really had been  doing comedy about 10, 15 years.  Really?  And I was like, he is the, I don't know if you're allowed to curse here or not.  Oh, yeah.  Go ahead.  He was the, he was the best, you know, like when you watch him, just like the way, the 
[03:27:30]  way he, the way he just like filled the place up, the stuff he had to say, this was before  like, you know, all the media, the social media.  Right, right.  Like, I remember hearing lines from him, like, just from like everybody, like everybody,  everybody was on his stuff.  It was so good.  Yeah.  Back before you could just tweet something out there, people actually had to see it.  Yeah.  And want to talk about it.  And butcher it.  In public.  And butcher it, right.  And butcher it, right. 
[03:28:00]  And then he goes, there's fucking sand.  What?  And he goes, move, move by the, the, the water.  The thing.  What was it?  The thing.  What was it?  No, it was funny.  It was funny.  So I'm making fun of people relaying jokes.  I loved Kinison.  Oh, no.  His material was unbelievable.  He was a great, great comedian.  I loved the, like, the dynamic he had.  Because everybody knows the screamy.  Yes.  Yes.  But that dynamic when he would just be like, yeah, so, you know, you're just sitting around.  And, like, that whole very soft-spoken, you know, it's like a cameraman could give him 
[03:28:30]  a sandwich.  You know, something like that.  A sandwich.  The high and low of it.  It wasn't always, yeah, it wasn't always screaming.  It was fucking great, man.  I never got to see him at the comedy store before he hit big, because Maren, I was talking  to Mark Maren, and, like, he would see him all the time there.  And I was like, I wish I could have seen that.  But that must have been great when he was working all that stuff out.  Yeah.  You know, he was just working it out.  But he was like, you know, at the comedy store, like, if you're the last act, like, you go  long, and you, like, just, like, roll out.  And he must have been doing that there, like, just, like, because that's the latest club 
[03:29:00]  in L.A., so he must have been doing it, like, you know, the strippers and the drug  people and the cool people.  Just, like, rolling for, like, L.A. late, you know, 1230, 1 o'clock.  Yeah.  L.A. late.  L.A. late 30.  But, yeah, now, he, I would love to have seen him, like, getting all that together.  That must have been really cool.  What didn't make it?  Yeah, yeah, what the, yeah, what fucking, yeah, guess I won't use that.  Yeah.  I gotta go, guys.  I'll see you later.  No, Jim.  Jim, have a great weekend. 
[03:29:30]  Thanks.  Fun-filled it's gonna be.  What's that flight gonna be like with Kenny?  I wouldn't know.  I'm not in the same part of the plane.  Florentine's on my flight, too.  He is.  Yeah, why?  Why are we flying together?  What's fun about it?  Just fucking logical fingers.  Why?  I got some really bad gasses.  Yeah, I was dropping gassers.  That's fun.  Did you smell that one?  His logic is so perfect, it makes me ill.  He's gonna ask you about it, if you smelled one.  Yeah, did you get that?  No, he was gonna get that one. 
[03:30:00]  We watched Sabbath together in the fucking sound booth, and I would just smell, like, rancid  potato chips, and I would look over and see that asshole smiling.  I'm like, really?  While they're playing Age of Reason, really?  I'll see you guys.  Have a good week.  See you, Jim.  Good luck.  Watch Dave's stuff.  It's fucking...  I saw a lot of that material on the road with Dave.  It was really brilliant.  Oh, thanks, buddy.  Comedy Central, David Tell this weekend, and Jim Norton in Tampa.  Oh, good news.  Wow.  No, no, good news.  You're staying.  After this weekend, I am back for well over a month. 
[03:30:30]  Oh, boy.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Really got a little fruity towards the end of that.  It kind of did, didn't it, Dave?  What does he mean, well back over a month?  Oh, he's not on the road.  No.  No.  Jim.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He does a lot of Fridays off to show the world his comedy.  He's a busy guy.  Yeah.  You see him and Kenny, you know, go out on the road.  You see them, you know, Kenny with the bags and everything.  Yeah.  Jim wearing his goggle glasses.  Right. 
[03:31:00]  You don't have to be preparing for a flight or a stunt.  Right.  It's going to set up a ramp.  I love Kenny's comfy clothes.  Yeah.  When he comes in, it's just, you know.  I told him today I'm buying him new jeans.  Yeah.  Those are just...  He has one pair of jeans that he wears when him and Jimmy hit the road.  So you get to see it on Fridays.  I haven't been to the big and tall place to buy new ones.  Some old Tuftsians or a dungaree.  Dungarees. 
[03:31:30]  He's a 38-34.  Wow.  Is he?  38 waist, 34 length, which is a little strange.  Wow, that's kind of weird.  Because I think I was wearing like 32s and he's much taller than me.  Two inches.  I don't understand it.  Those kind of...  Well, the pants are a little high on him, right?  They are, right?  He's a torso man.  He's a torso guy.  I need to be able to access my ankle.  He does have a swimmer's build, Kenny.  You know, when you think about it.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's Moby Dick.  But he's one of those guys when he packs, he can only pack a few items because he has 
[03:32:00]  just giant clothes.  Yes.  Patrice was like that.  I saw Patrice's suitcase once.  He had one pair of pants and like, I don't know, a hoodie.  And then it filled up his whole fucking suitcase.  Topped off with glass dildos.  Right.  Oh, the day he brought in those glass dildos.  He actually brought them in, huh?  We had a heart-to-heart with him.  He was all excited to show us all his glass dildos.  And we...  Me and Ann just looked at it and went, well, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  What is this? 
[03:32:30]  So where are they now?  Are they like in a museum or like...  Yeah, right.  What do you do with those afterwards?  That's a weird...  That's a good question.  Fucking make wind chimes out of them and...  That's a weird thing in a will.  And the glass dildos will go.  I bequeath my glass dildos under the prerequisite that they be only utilized in Brazilian hooker  asses.  But if they are not, I bequeath them to a school for children to be sold off. 
[03:33:00]  Hold up the biggest one to the North Star.  You'll find with a treasure.  The keyhole to the treasure.  It's like the Bill Hicks bit, where the parents have to go through his place after he dies  and find all the weird shit.  Wow, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  So one of his family members had to do the old...  And what's in this box?  That bit's hilarious.  It's like, he was such a good boy.  Right.  Oh, what's in here?  And it's just porno.  What was it again in the Bill Hicks bit?  I'm trying to remember.  I think it was like...  What kind of porn, though?  He wouldn't just say porn.  Yeah, it was like just gay fucking animal porn, whatever the fuck. 
[03:33:30]  That would be the new business.  Like, you know, we get rid of your porn after you go.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  After you go, they come in and clean it like the wolf in Pulp Fiction.  Replace it with just, you know, Ted Danson movies.  Yeah, yeah.  Family-friendly fair.  Loved Bill Hicks.  Yeah.  Loved him.  But Sam passed away before Bill, or was it vice versa?  Before.  I think it was before.  Sure.  Yeah.  Because I remember I was at SNL when Bill Hicks passed away. 
[03:34:00]  I was so bummed out.  I was like...  Yeah, yeah.  I was really like, wow.  I couldn't believe...  And I was asking people, I was like, did you know...  I don't think any of them really knew him.  Yeah, he was just...  Like, he never was that kind of guy.  No, not at all.  He was a comic, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  He was definitely not right in there as a known comic when he went.  Which is crazy, because he was brilliant.  Yeah.  He was brilliant.  I saw him with Adam at Governor's one night, and I was able to go in there and actually...  How was that show?  Oh, boy. 
[03:34:30]  Look out.  I never saw him.  It was very cool, though, to hang out and actually talk to him for a little while.  That's awesome.  Just, you know, small talk, but it was definitely fucking cool.  Did he mix it up good with the Long Island crowd?  Oh, yeah.  Because that's a tough crowd sometimes at Governor's.  Yeah, yeah, which is weird.  Long Islanders, they seem like goofy people that want to laugh.  I don't know.  Gotta earn it.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what it is.  Long Islanders, they're not just going to fucking laugh at it.  A little tougher.  Coming out on stage.  Because that room, like, when Bill told me that, like, you know, when you see him,  like, I guess you can still see it on YouTube, like, all these crazy Southern gigs, 
[03:35:00]  you know?  So he was, like, everybody says he's the father of, like, modern-day all-comedy.  It's like, he played these rooms that even, like, regular straight-up, you know, puppet  acts, you know, would be like, oh, I'm not going.  They're not going to get me.  Am I right, Mr. Tickles?  They're not going to get us.  He's playing a hardcore road.  He was on the road.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I always admired that about him, you know?  Screaming at the guys in the audience.  I love that.  Mr. Tickles.  Yeah, yeah.  That's great.  Yeah, I remember that when Sam died, I was, uh, it is weird, because it's so hacky to 
[03:35:30]  just say, like, I remember where I was, right?  But you do, within those situations.  I was in my parents' driveway.  I know exactly where.  It was one of those things.  I was really bummed by his passing.  I was doing a gig at Westbury Music Fair, but it was an air-conditioning and heating gig.  I was actually installing.  That's a gig?  It was.  A gig's a gig, though.  It's installing air-conditioning.  You hear the electric wrench.  What did I just hear on the radio?  What?  Turn off that sawzall.  I gotta hear this. 
[03:36:00]  And now, recently, Panette, who is another, like, road legend, John Panette, sad passing  there.  He was only 50 years old.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  See, I've been doing comedy 25 years.  That means he's been doing it almost, pretty much from when I was a tweener, because he  has to be doing it 10 years more than me.  Longer than you, right.  Easily.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, he was like a legend on the road when I started.  What kind of guy was he?  You know what?  I have to tell you this.  Because every club in America, when you go to the club, and John Panette was just there,  they always are, like, still smiling. 
[03:36:30]  They love him.  He was such a great guy.  He was like the crowds, you know, like my crowds drink, his crowds ate.  Like, they would be like, we're out of chicken fingers.  Panette was just here.  He was a great guy.  He really was.  And, you know, it's a sad passing for him.  I mean, really, it's just sad.  Yeah.  Because I know he tried to, you know, he went to rehab.  He tried to figure his shit out.  We never had him on the show, I don't think.  No.  Why not?  I don't know.  That surprised me.  I don't know.  That surprised me.  He was on the last episode of Seinfeld. 
[03:37:00]  Seinfeld.  Yeah.  So now it was him, and then recently also the guy that was the prosecutor in the Seinfeld  case episode.  No way.  He just recently died, too.  So I'm thinking cursed episode.  It was a cursed episode.  Yeah.  Cursed episode.  Morty is dead.  His mother, right?  Wow.  Dead.  Yeah.  What about George's mom?  That's sad.  No, she's still alive.  Oh, sorry.  Sorry, George's mom.  Oh, the curse.  He's all the lovable characters. 
[03:37:30]  Right.  Oh, that's sad.  Yeah.  But yeah, John, he was a good dude, and he also, you know, for a road guy, he really  did, like, sell it out.  You know, you're always like, oh, Panette would sell this out easy.  And, you know, he played the city and everything, too, so he would go to Caroline's and all  that kind of stuff.  Who died at some point that people were like, wow, that guy was a real scumbag?  Like, I know Hitler.  Yeah, Saddam Hussein.  Saddam, Uday, and Hussein.  You've got to put Bin Laden on that list. 
[03:38:00]  Bin Laden.  But, I mean, as far as entertainers go, it's very hard for people to be like, that guy  was a fucking asshole.  Yeah.  Well, Mickey Rooney, I think, is a great guy, because when you look at his story, eight  marriages, broke.  He was broke when he was 40, so what year was that?  Like, 1898?  I mean, he was broke.  Yes!  I think he's the coolest guy.  He was in World War II.  Do you know this?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, he was a sniper in World War II.  Really?  You didn't have to do that.  You didn't have to do that. 
[03:38:30]  You could have sold war bonds.  Of course.  Judy Garland's and whatnot of the day.  The Danny K's.  With the uniform on, dancing across the stage.  All the USA!  Fucking thousands of miles away from any bullet.  He would tap up to the enemy.  When he was a sniper, did he, yeah, walk around like a bush or something?  Yeah, he's a little fucking rock.  I love that about him.  I can't believe, did you read how much he was worth at the time of his passing?  18 grand.  18 large, motherfucker.  18 stacks of high society. 
[03:39:00]  A Hollywood legend.  You would think some of those assholes out there in Hollywood would notice that Mickey  Rooney's broke by just looking at probably what he was wearing and maybe slip him an envelope  every once in a while.  Mickey.  Take care of the legends.  That is sad, isn't it, huh?  You would think one of those guys that has more money than they'll ever spend would have  like, you know, maybe sent him something.  He had to keep working.  Like, the guy was constantly fucking had to keep working.  He was 93, so that's a lot of money for a 93-year-old, though.  Yeah, you know.  I mean.  What are you going to do with it?  But he has those eight wives, so like, I'm sure they were always calling him all the time. 
[03:39:30]  I'm like, I'm not here.  I've got old timers.  I don't remember marrying you.  But he was talking about the times, all the movies he made early in life that he just  got nothing for.  They paid you like shit.  And that was it.  Ah, you're going to be huge here at Metro.  Right.  It's just fucking, you just get shit on and they fire you and that's it.  Our relationship's ending here, but it's amicable.  That's what the news will say.  God, your jokes are accurate. 
[03:40:00]  Metro.  Here at Metro.  18 grand in 1938 money.  Let's figure that out.  1938 money.  What did you buy?  And they're still abusing him because they're fighting over where they're going to bury the  guy.  Are they?  And he doesn't want to be buried by the stepson that did him wrong because the stepson  has some kind of plot already.  Yes.  Isn't there that Hollywood cemetery that a lot of celebrities are buried in?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What makes it cool?  They have all like all the celebrities like like Valentino.  He's there.  Ah, Valentino. 
[03:40:30]  I'm trying to.  I don't know.  They have like all the cool celebrities.  Yeah.  Fred Mertz there.  Marilyn Monroe, I believe, is there.  I want to be buried there in the voiceover.  Uh, shadow, uh, shadow, shadow area, extras, extras, one line, extras, they're buried like  on the, on the driveway up.  Cause there's like all these cool, it's really like really cool, like a monument and all that  kind of stuff.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, like, uh, are any of you guys Russian Orthodox? 
[03:41:00]  No.  They have the coolest tombstones.  It's like, uh, reflective black marble with a face staring at you.  Wow.  Like you see like an effigy of them.  Really?  And it really looks cool.  That's kind of creepy.  It is really creepy.  They're putting a lot of things in tombstones now with, uh, like, um, these little hologram-ish  things of the people that look, you know, so you can see their face from different angles.  Uh, yeah, yeah.  Audio of them speaking and, uh, video screens where when you come up to the, you start pushing 
[03:41:30]  buttons.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you get like video, like fucking YouTube videos of, you know, your loved ones.  That's exactly right.  Where you can tape a message and have people, you know, so you can berate them from the  They have this for real.  Yeah, yeah.  There are tombstones with actual multimedia embedded in it.  And, uh, yeah, you're just there.  Well, the ultimate thing to do is to like, just tape them at, you know, thank you for  coming.  You are the love of my life.  And just like, name a different name than your wife, Claire. 
[03:42:00]  Wait, who's this Claire?  I've always loved you.  If your name starts with a C, press one.  Thanks for coming.  Yeah.  Thank you.  I want a robot voice.  Thank you for coming.  Move along.  The, the grave diggers are stealing.  They have stolen my gold teeth from beyond the grave.  That's a, that's a, yeah, that's a new business.  We can do that. 
[03:42:30]  Yeah.  Right.  Wouldn't you get into that?  I don't know.  I think some cemeteries, uh, poo poo things like, unless, uh, they're just the standard burial  and tombstone, they get like, well, some cemeteries don't even like you to put flowers on graves  unless it's a certain time of the year or occasion.  Oh, right.  So there, you know, things like that.  So I think multimedia might be a thing.  So their thing is, let's be as sad as possible.  Sad as possible.  Well, somebody wanted a tombstone shaped like Spongebob because Spongebob is kind of like  shaped like a tombstone.  Right.  So they wanted a Spongebob tombstone. 
[03:43:00]  Nice.  And, uh, the cemetery was like, nah, we can't have that.  Why?  Because then you think about it.  I think if everyone did something weird, it would kind of look like a miniature golf  course.  Yeah.  You know?  That's a great idea.  That's a wacky thing.  That would be just put your way through the cemetery.  Why would it make it more, more people would go if there was more fun there?  Why would it be the guy that starts that cemetery?  Yeah.  You would do all right.  That's the business.  Well, you can do anything.  Miniature golf and a cemetery combined.  That would be great.  The grass is there.  Copyright there.  The obstacles are there with the tombstones.  You could have the different one.  Get it in the loved one's mouth. 
[03:43:30]  Because it's your uncle?  Yeah.  Because the kids don't give a fuck that they're there.  So give them something to do, right?  Putting.  You sure that's not something out there already?  Because that is a great idea.  I know.  It just popped in my head, so I hope not.  I really would.  That's a really...  You better...  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I got to jump right on that.  Oh, too late.  Someone's got it, I'm sure.  Yeah.  Mini golf cemetery.  That would be great.  I like that idea.  I like the idea of, you know, with the screen.  Yeah.  With the screen there.  And people are now burying their pets. 
[03:44:00]  That's another good idea.  Big money in that.  The pet cemetery.  Because you're not allowed to bury in your backyard.  You can't do that anymore.  I don't know.  What is it?  Some kind of a hazardous waste thing?  Yeah, some of the water table.  Oh, the water table.  Look out for that water table.  I think my dad used to just throw our pets in the woods somewhere.  Save the money.  There you go.  As a kid, it was a very Lord of the Flies kind of an existence.  When you'd walk through the woods and you'd go, you'd start smelling and you knew it was  like a nearby dead animal.  Right. 
[03:44:30]  And that was someone's family pet.  Try to find it.  Growing up on Long Island, there always was that one kind of weird river.  And there was always a garbage bag with a dead dog or cat.  I don't know if that was somebody's job.  Like, let's make this as weird and sad as possible.  Serial killer-ish.  But it was like just a trickle of disgusting water and you're like that.  Flies.  What is it?  Oh, it's a dead cake.  Yeah, it's the smell.  And as a kid, you know, that was fucking great.  It was an adventure.  Yeah.  You know, you're out there like exploring. 
[03:45:00]  Being a kid.  But I do remember Long Island when I was growing up as being very adventurous.  There was a lot of shit.  I was in East Isol at one point.  It was by that Heckscher Park area.  And just going through there, it was very, like, a lot of ferns and weird amphibians.  Like, Long Island used to have amphibians.  Like a newt.  You could find a newt.  I don't know when they went extinct completely.  Let's talk Long Island weaponry.  Like, when you were a kid, were you a BB gun man, wrist rocket, or nunchucks are all three? 
[03:45:30]  My brother was a nunchucks guy.  He loved a little bit of the martial arts.  I could tell what job your dad had by your weaponry.  We would have a weaponry.  I think that was working for the town.  You were able to make.  And you would just make it.  Like, all right, I got a couple of these dowels I found in the garage and some chain.  We would make my mom buy stuff that we could wrist rocket with.  Like, Mom, can you get the ball bearings?  Could you, bleh?  Hey, where are all the nuts and bolts? 
[03:46:00]  Oh, we wrist rocketed it all over the yard.  Yeah, yeah.  We were constantly, we were wrist rocketing.  We were making, what was the movie, like when, like, like a Bible movie where they made their thing.  Yeah, yeah.  A lot of eyes and teeth were broken.  Yes, a sling.  A sling.  A sling like Davian Goliath.  It was David's slew Goliath.  I do remember it was very hard to get your parents to talk them into why you needed six feet of surgical tubing. 
[03:46:30]  It's a fucking thing that you could stretch out and fire things at light speed.  And then we had the rocketry.  Did you have your own?  I have your rockets.  Estes model rockets.  My brother, he was in charge of that.  Yeah.  We were at that age right before we realized the glue was more fun than the rocket.  But we were, like, rocketing.  We were constantly seeing how far or low we could aim the trajectory.  Right.  Before it became a weapon.  Well, you know what?  I think the rules said you were saying. 
[03:47:00]  Joe, my brother was in the Army for a while, and he had some friends that visited from the Army.  And they had brought, like, a trunk full of ordnance.  And it was training ordnance, but it was still, like, there were these little tripwire things.  There were things that would set up on these obstacle courses and exercises.  Like smoke.  Simulators. 
[03:47:30]  Smoke.  They would make explosions, but without the shrapnel and stuff like that.  And noises and tripwires and whatnot.  And flares, those things.  You'd take the top off the tube, hit the bottom.  Right.  And a flare would come down on a parachute.  And it lit the night sky up, man.  It just lit the neighborhood up.  And we had this one.  It was an Abrams tank shell simulator.  So it would blow up with the intensity of the blast of a tank shell hitting something.  But without all the pesky, you know, metal and death and fire raining down on you. 
[03:48:00]  Depleted uranium.  Yeah, it depleted uranium, all that fun stuff.  But it needed a dry cell battery to set it off.  So we went and got a dry cell and got about 50 feet of wire.  50 feet of wire on a spool and went down to the John Glenn High School track.  Me and a bunch of my buddies and unrolled it.  And boy, that 50 feet looked real short when you know what's at the other end of it.  Because I unrolled it.  I'm like, I think I'm really still close to this thing.  Very close to it. 
[03:48:30]  So I thought, here's my physics at the time, my science.  I'll put the negative terminal.  And I'll put the wire on that one.  And then I'll hook the wire.  And I'll stand back in a running position and drop the wire on the contact and run,  beating the speed of life as the electrons flow through the wire.  50 feet.  Yeah, yeah, 50 feet.  Picturing it, that's not far.  Well, you got away a little bit, right?  I got away a little. 
[03:49:00]  I turned my back, which was good.  I dropped it and fucking got flung a few feet in the air and hit the ground.  And I woke up like blinking.  Someone's giving me a message.  Sorry, go ahead.  I woke up like blinking and counting my fingers like one, two.  It was a concussion.  A concussion blast.  A fucking blast.  How, how, where did you do this in front of your house?  No, this was at the high school track.  Yes.  Okay.  You always went down to high school. 
[03:49:30]  You know, that was a big field.  You could, everyone knew where it was.  That's hilarious.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was fun.  I got to interrupt.  Uh-oh.  Brandon Steiner is pissed, I think.  Is he mad?  Is he coming in?  He's got to go.  Oh, no.  No.  He looks like he's walking the other way and Roland's walking with his head down.  Get him in here.  Did we blow him?  What happened?  We didn't blow him off.  I'm leaving.  Roland, Roland.  No, you're not leaving.  I wanted to go through the memorabilia with him.  What happened, Roland?  Did we mess this one up?  Roland, did we screw up?  What happened?  I thought, uh, I thought he had time. 
[03:50:00]  What happened, Roland?  No, he said to make sure you two know this.  Oh, no.  What?  What?  He had to go to a meeting.  He said, uh, just to reschedule him because, uh.  All right.  But was he in the city anyway?  No, he came all the way from upstate.  That's where the.  No way.  That's where the.  No, but where's his meeting?  What?  Where's his meeting?  Um, Connecticut.  So to have him come in for a few minutes.  But he came from all the way from Albany.  Connecticut.  So have him come in now. 
[03:50:30]  No, no.  Did he come in the memorabilia mobile?  Tell him, come on now.  Oh, no.  He had a 10 o'clock meeting.  I didn't know that.  We're running late today.  We didn't know that either.  He got a call.  He goes, I really have to go.  He goes, we'll just reschedule and I'll see you another time.  I feel horrible.  What kind of meetings does he go to?  Yeah, that's a good signed ball.  He just left.  He didn't just leave.  He's right there, Eric.  Bring him in.  Let's get him in here for a second.  Yeah, let's.  Let's go.  Came away from Albany, guys.  Albany.  He's gone.  Yeah, because. 
[03:51:00]  He's got a meeting at 10.  No, he was fine though.  He goes, hey, I get it.  They're on the topic.  He's cool with it.  Yeah.  He was not mad.  He came in from Albany, guys.  He's trending up New York.  It's Albany.  It's the same state from Geneseo.  That is a long drive, though.  I give it to him.  That is a long drive.  Yeah, he just said that.  You know what a long drive is?  Binghamton.  Yes.  You ever do that drive to Binghamton?  Yes, many times.  It's a college drive.  It sucks.  It's a college drive.  You know you're only doing it to get pussy if you're a guy.  To get to college.  Because God knows I wasn't going to college.  But that was the halfway point to go to Rochester and Geneseo for me. 
[03:51:30]  Halfway point.  That was halfway.  We would stop at Binghamton for lunch.  We still had to keep going after that.  That's like either you're very young or very old.  Yes.  It's college fun or apple picking.  Apple picking.  Apple picking.  Pick an apple.  I used to have to go to Quinnipiac College for a girl.  Where's that?  In Connecticut.  Oh.  Connecticut.  Yeah.  You used to have to drive there.  And that was always like, oh boy.  I was just at Foxwoods.  And let me tell you something.  That has the feel of like a college campus. 
[03:52:00]  Have you been there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Definitely.  You drive through the woods.  It's like a little town.  Yes.  In the middle of the forest.  You go all the way through.  It's like one lane to get to a casino, which is always weird at night.  No lights.  Yes.  It's very stark in the middle of nowhere.  And then you get the room.  You go up and look out the window.  And it's just trees.  In the middle of nowhere.  Right.  In the middle of nowhere.  There's a lake.  There's a mountain.  It's really nice there.  It's beautiful.  But you know what?  You want some shit around you?  It's probably a good thing that it's not close.  Like you always have to drive far to get to a casino. 
[03:52:30]  Exactly.  Which is probably a good thing.  Not anymore, though.  They're popping up all over the place.  I would be like, oh yeah, I'm going to run out to the store, get some bread, and play  a few hands up like that.  Let's go to Matt in Texas.  He's from Long Island, and he's surprised we're not talking about one thing about growing up  on Long Island.  Dirt bomb fights?  Dirt bomb fights were a biggie.  It was like fucking wars over the fences.  Sure.  Matt.  Hey, you guys don't remember hanging out in the sump?  The sump.  The sump.  Yes, every time he had a sump.  He had the sump, and there was always a story of some kid that drowned in the sump. 
[03:53:00]  Be careful.  Every sump took a kid.  That's Billy's watch.  He went to the sump.  I remember that.  That's a great one.  Yeah, that is a good one.  His mother never got over it.  I remember she was on the stoop crying when the cops told her.  With a house coat.  Yeah.  We mow her long as we feel bad for her.  That's exactly it.  The Long Island tragedy.  The sump drowning.  And kids fall through the ponds.  Yeah, fall through the ponds.  You used to be able to ice skate wherever the fuck you wanted. 
[03:53:30]  That's true.  When we grew up.  And then you just pulled over and just said, ah, this looks good enough.  There was this Suffolk County cop that had white hair, and everyone called him Stoneface.  And the rumors that went on about this guy that he was only 25 years old, and he had  this stark gray hair because he rolled up on a horrible accident where children were  dead all over the street.  And you don't want to get pulled over by Stoneface because he's very strict.  Because he saw children die, and his hair went white overnight. 
[03:54:00]  How did you get around?  Like, were you bicycling around?  As a youngster, it was all about bicycling, man.  Everyone, like, they were just roving packs of friends on bikes.  You don't even fucking see that.  Parents are so scared to let their kids out, I think.  But we used to bike everywhere.  And the parents, on the weekend, it was like, all right, we'll see you later.  And you'd leave the house at, like, 8 in the morning, and you'd come home when it was 
[03:54:30]  dark.  Supper time.  And your parents didn't give a flying, fuck where you were, what you were doing.  But that's the beauty of New York compared to, like, growing up on Long Island, you see  anybody on a bike, you know that, like, that was their plan B.  Someone couldn't give them a ride.  They're pulling a power mower to a job.  Some guy's holding, like, half a weight bench.  He's going to his friend's house.  It was always like, oh, this is so sad. 
[03:55:00]  They always had that look of, like, you know, Anthony was going to pick me up.  Fucking ass.  Squirrels.  You know, like, just like, yeah, I wish I was hotter.  I would have a boyfriend with a car.  It was just always bad.  In New York, it's like, everybody has to just, like, chin up.  Oh, I'm on a bicycle.  Look at how cool I am.  Yeah, yeah.  So I'll never get over to that one.  I'm just, like, everyone on a bike.  It's a hot day.  A ball's hanging out.  It's not just, like, some old weirdo on a bike.  If you were over 16 on a bike, yeah, you got fucked somehow.  Yes.  You were the one that got the DUI.  Right, right. 
[03:55:30]  You lost your license for a while.  Yeah.  But then the worst thing was you would get your car.  You'd get 16.  You'd get your license.  You'd get a car.  You're, like, fucking styling.  But you didn't have the money to maintain it.  Or if something broke, you'd have to wait, like, a week or two weeks to get the money to fix it.  So then you were relegated back to the bike.  Yes.  Which really sucked because you were used to driving now, having a car.  We got Richie.  God, I love this.  It has to be the same Richie.  Richie, is this you?  Yes, it is, sir. 
[03:56:00]  Hold on.  Really fast.  Did you just join Twitter or is someone faking you?  No, no, no.  It's me.  I've been on, but I just never paid much attention to it.  That's me.  All right.  Richie, we got David Tell in the studio.  I love your style, Richie.  Who's got a couple things happening.  Let me give the plug really fast because we haven't done it in a bit.  David Tell is going to be on Comedy Central this weekend.  Saturday night, he's got David Tell Roadwork.  And then right after that, it's Comedy Underground.  Comedy Underground.  Comedy Underground.  So check it out on Comedy Central.  Taking it to the depths of comedy. 
[03:56:30]  One of our favorites, David Tell.  But anyway, go ahead, Richie.  You guys never mentioned Skitchin, Moe.  Skitchin.  Oh, there you go.  That was a long-out thing.  Bad kids.  And I got one more question.  Anybody ever lose a glove in the back of a bumper like I did?  Oh, wow.  You grab onto the back of the bumper, the car takes off, and they...  Yes, I had that deal.  Oh, the King Cullen, uh...  Yes!  Absolutely. 
[03:57:00]  And then if you got wheels...  That was our winter boots.  You put the fucking, uh, bags on.  Oh, the bags.  Not my house.  But you had a...  Cousin Brucey.  Brucey.  Brucey.  Oh, wow.  Really?  Come here to see.  Cousin Bruce Morrow.  Hold on, Richie.  I'm going to go back to you.  Hold on.  Cousin Bruce Morrow.  There he is.  Come back to Cousin Brucey.  We got a real interesting...  What do you got?  What do you got?  Wait, get on mic.  Dave Clark is coming on.  Dave Clark of the Dave Clark Five.  Dave Clark Five.  You know, he did a...  It's down to Dave Clark Three, but... 
[03:57:30]  It might not be on Mark.  PBS special?  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  By the way, you guys look...  UGLY!  Oh, no, you do.  Isn't that why we all got into Radio Cousin?  That's it.  Yeah, you're right.  Really nice.  We got into the business right there. 
[03:58:00]  Tip of the hat.  There he goes.  Thank you, Cousin Brucey.  Here it is.  Easy.  That's amazing.  I think he was at JFK when the Beatles landed.  Right there.  I think he was one of those guys.  Right there at Idlewild.  How old is he?  He looks fucking great.  He must have that stuff just in his closet that's worth millions of dollars.  Millions.  Oh, Bobby Darin's inhaler?  Sure.  He left it at this funny story.  He left it at the studio.  Inhaler.  Sammy Davis' real eye.  He gave it to me as a gift.  And formaldehyde.  78. 
[03:58:30]  78 years old.  There's no way that guy's 78.  He's the right with it.  He's all with it, too.  I listen to the 60s on 6 every so often, and you get Cousin Brucey there spinning the  old hot wax, as they said back in the day.  Let's get back to Richie in Long Island.  Richie.  I got one more.  I got one more.  Not that I ever did it because it's not legal, but did you gentlemen that  we would perhaps enter an ice cream truck at nighttime?  Wow.  No.  You were one of those kids.  You were the cool kid.  You were the cool kid. 
[03:59:00]  You did the stuff you were too scared to do.  Yes.  You ever do a B&E on an ice cream truck?  No.  No.  My mother said if I finished my chores, she'd buy me an ice cream.  You ever tune up a gas station attendant?  I love this guy.  Off the L.I.E.?  Yeah.  Well, why don't you explain, Richie?  Well, like I said, not that I did it, but I used to hear stories about people that live  close to circus men, like outlets or other things.  And back in the day, it wasn't a big deal. 
[03:59:30]  You could get into these places.  No cameras and no doors.  Right.  Pesky security.  It was a better life.  But anyway, we used to make it into the ice cream truck at night, and we don't talk about  forget about it.  There's no limitations.  Yeah.  The one thing I was happy about was I didn't have diabetes after all that business.  Hey.  So let me ask you this.  Would you, was that for just the fun of it, for the ice cream or to resell the ice cream  on the street to, you know, down the road, like, you know, out of the trunk? 
[04:00:00]  You know, I didn't have much of an entrepreneurial spirit back then, but I was kind of just in  it for a while.  I'm not supposed to be doing this shit.  Yeah.  Hey, Jimmy, what kind of ice cream you got?  How you doing?  You complain, but who'd listen?  This guy's always good for something, a sandwich, an ice cream sandwich. 
[04:00:30]  But what Jimmy really loved were ice cream trucks.  That's great, because any guy who drove an ice cream truck in the 70s and 80s, you knew  had pot, but would never give it to you because you weren't a chick.  Like, it was all like, that was like his thing.  Like, you know, hey, oh, your cousin's in the neighborhood, you know, like she, she got  all the cool stuff.  Hey, you got a phone.  You got a phone.  Two niggers stole my ice cream truck.  The cool thing about that time was, like you said, the driving, like once you started 
[04:01:00]  driving. </pre>
