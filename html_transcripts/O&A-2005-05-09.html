<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, Opie, Anthony Cumia, and Jimmy Norton, complaining about new headphones. Norton then announced his HBO show pickup for 12 episodes, detailing his character as a pot-dealing friend.  A discussion about tax issues ensued, with Cumia recounting a humorous traffic stop stemming from an illegal right turn, culminating in a phone call with one of the officers, Chris, who playfully recounted the incident.

The show transitioned to a discussion of Brian Regan's stand-up performances at Caroline's.  Regan joined the show as a guest, sharing anecdotes about his recent physical, his doctor's comments on his weight, and the general absurdity of medical interactions, particularly doctors’ euphemisms and dentists’ bedside manner.  The conversation returned to Regan's shows, focusing on hecklers and contrasting his approach with other comedians.  Norton then recounted a negative experience with a massage therapist, leading to a broader discussion of unconventional medical practices, including acupuncture, and listener calls detailing unusual medical experiences and alternative therapies.  One caller, Joe from Philly, described his acupuncture treatment, including needles placed "underneath my ball bag," for rheumatoid arthritis and muscle problems, sparking a debate on the purpose of needle placement.

The show then featured an interview with Nanny Yvonne from *Nanny 911*. The conversation covered the show's dysfunctional families, challenging children (including anecdotes about a four-year-old using the "F" word and calling her mother a "fat fuck," and a child who wasn't potty trained), and various parenting styles and disciplinary approaches, ranging from "the evil eye" to spanking.  Callers shared parenting challenges and sought advice from Nanny Yvonne.  One caller's anecdote about his son's game "Monster Rain," involving potentially sexually suggestive actions, led to a discussion about addressing inappropriate sexual behavior in children. The interview also touched upon Nanny Yvonne's appearance and age. This segment concluded with a discussion of the etymology of "fuck," a debate about profanity on live television (citing System of a Down on *Saturday Night Live*), and the playing of Pat O'Brien remixes, one featuring a woman believing Anthony to be her father.  The hosts expressed frustration with Fox for rushing the interview.

Following this, the show continued with sexually suggestive and offensive language, discussions about child-rearing, nannies, and weight. The hosts played listener-submitted audio clips containing explicit sexual content and offensive remarks, and engaged in a comedic bit about handling female co-hosts.  A listener called in discussing his preference for a "medium build" woman, leading to further discussion of body image.  Several phone calls, including one about an ex-wife's weight loss and new relationship, were incorporated.  The hosts frequently used phrases like "no offense" before making highly offensive comments and promoted Opie and Anthony merchandise.

The show later shifted to a discussion of overweight people in malls, transitioning to a caller, Tammy from Maine, who shared her 115-pound weight loss journey.  Clips from "Marriage 911" were played, followed by a discussion of a lawsuit against David Barton Gym alleging rampant gay sex.  A former employee of a different gym called in to corroborate the claims. Opie shared a story about a man blow-drying his hair naked in a gym locker room.  A caller, Beth from Seattle, recounted a sexual encounter in a gym locker room. Ross Bennett was a guest in the studio during much of this segment.  The show concluded this section with discussion of Tony Danza’s anger issues, a Gamefly promotion, and additional caller interactions, including a request for a sarcasm segment and a somewhat explicit phone call.

The final segment featured a discussion about a comedian's experiences working on cruises.  This transitioned into a pre-planned segment where Ricky, an unpaid intern, nervously presented a poorly written and possibly plagiarized report on sarcasm.  The hosts and studio crew, including Nathaniel (a comedy contest winner), heavily criticized and mocked Ricky's presentation, repeatedly interrupting and insulting him.  The segment concluded with further jokes at Ricky's expense before the show ended.

[00:04:00]  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  We are going to dumb this thing down  to the point that we're going to be number one  with Down Syndrome children.  Don't do it!  It's terrifying.  The OVNN show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  Okay, terrific.  Dylan!  Stop it!  You're so stupid!  Quiet, quiet, quiet.  You're a phony!  Hey, this guy's a great big phony!  Stop whining!  You're a great big phony, you know that?  Stop whining!  That's right.  You're a big fat phony!  Stop it!  Ah! 
[00:05:00]  Howdy, Quaid!  What the hell were you thinking?  Mom!  Please stop calling me!  You son of a bitch!  Mom!  I'm not the Lord!  I have to do this now!  I'm a cop, you idiot!  You're an idiot!  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony program! 
[00:05:30]  Hello!  Ah, man, we're testing out new headphones.  Yes, we are.  Right off the bat, I hate them.  Do ya?  You get used to them.  They're a little more muffled sounding than they're usual.  They're muffled.  There's a lot of bass in there, right?  Yeah.  That is skinny.  Where's my old headphones?  Uh-oh.  Yeah, go get them.  Oh, boy.  Well, I lost, I don't know, close to 20% of my hearing.  What?  Exactly.  Doing this radio thing for so many years. 
[00:06:00]  I don't know, this is going to be a little strange.  What?  What?  What?  What?  You got new headphones, Jimmy?  Yes.  How do you enjoy them?  It's hard.  I haven't been happy with my sound at all, so it might just be that I don't like the sound  of my voice in headphones.  Yeah.  I feel like I'm talking underwater right now.  But that might not be anything wrong with the mic.  I don't know.  Jimmy sounded a little low.  Okay.  All right, I'll turn him up.  There you go.  Now that he's a big star.  That's right.  Hey, hey.  Jimmy's got huge news. 
[00:06:30]  No?  Oh.  Ricky's late with the coffee?  Well, that's not huge news.  No, that's the same old news.  Yeah, I found it on Friday.  They picked this up.  HBO picked up 12 episodes.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  So, I'm guaranteed sick.  I don't know if I'll be in.  How many I'll be in.  I have no idea.  Yeah.  I think we start shooting in July or August.  What's your character?  I play his friend Rich.  Rich.  Yeah.  I had one scene in the pilot where I play like this, just this cranky douchebag he hangs 
[00:07:00]  out with.  And it turns out that I sell pot to like high school kids.  Yeah.  Um, so yeah, it was, it's definitely a role.  I predict you will be like the Fonzie character in Happy Days.  All of a sudden.  The breakout character?  It starts and he wasn't even a character.  He was just some guy that, you know, rode the motorcycle, kind of a filler thing.  And before you know it, when you walk in, everyone will go, woo!  And you'll have to stop your line and then restart it again.  Yeah, you'll be that guy. 
[00:07:30]  The difference would be that I, I would have probably hit shortcake when she was 14.  You'll be the and as guy.  And Jimmy Norton as the beaver.  The beaver.  When you're like selling drugs, can Anthony and I just be in the background like leaning  up against a fence?  Yeah, you could be two older gentlemen hanging around the schoolyard.  Yeah.  I could get my SAG card now, you know.  You can?  So then I could, yeah.  Yeah, I got paid just the other day.  Got some check from, some residual check from some recording we did, some voiceover work. 
[00:08:00]  Did you get that yet?  Uh, where was it sent?  Oh boy.  Oh brother, you're a mess.  No?  Didn't get that?  When did you get that?  Yesterday.  Oh, alright, maybe I'll get it today.  And mine was actually, I guess down at the residual factory where they print these things  out and send them out.  Uh, my envelope was, was open, so the sticky part that you're supposed to lick was stuck  to another envelope.  So I wound up getting some other guy's check from North Carolina. 
[00:08:30]  I wanted to open it up and see what he's been doing.  But, uh.  That would have been cool.  I didn't.  I threw a stamp on it and put it in the mailbox.  No.  Nice guy.  What I got, um, yesterday was a, a letter from the government, Anthony.  Oh.  My taxes weren't paid.  What happened now?  I, I should have brought this in.  This would have been fun for the radio today.  Why didn't I do this?  My taxes weren't paid.  Your taxes weren't paid.  And the reason, I forgot to sign the check. 
[00:09:00]  And because I didn't sign the check for my taxes.  It's already up to $1,500 in penalties.  Going up, I don't know, 6% every 10 days or something crazy like that.  Like a loan shark.  It is unbelievable.  Yeah.  Just because I forgot to sign the check.  And the reason, because our taxes are, you and I, I don't even know what the hell's going on anymore.  We just get volumes of papers that we have to sign.  We just get like a stack of papers and, and they give us little post-its.  Sign here, sign here, sign here. 
[00:09:30]  Initial this, initial this.  Put this in this envelope.  Right.  And make sure you sign the checks.  Checks.  Yeah.  Lots of them.  Oh, boy.  So, um, one of the biggies, I didn't sign.  So it's just a complete nightmare.  And they give me all this paperwork, how to solve the problem.  But you could read the paperwork.  I wish I brought it in.  Three or four different ways.  I don't know what to do to solve this problem.  Now you don't know what to do.  And it's just going ching, ching, ching in my head.  I'm losing money by the hour here.  Call super agent.  Yeah.  He'll straighten it out.  Yeah, I'll, I'll figure that out today. 
[00:10:00]  Get his accountant on it.  One stupid signature, though.  That's what happens.  That's how they get you.  And they have all, they have all sorts of stamps on the checks.  So I don't know if I'm supposed to just sign that check and send it back.  Or write a new one.  Or write a new one for all the money I now owe.  Or do I owe the money because they sent me a form that I might not if I could pay this in 10 days.  You know what the best thing is?  When you send in a check now to pay the penalty.  But you send it in and then another penalty chalks up. 
[00:10:30]  So you haven't paid the full amount.  And then you forget about it because you paid it.  And then there's more money that you have to pay later on.  That happened to me.  I kept sending him a check.  Finally, I wrote him a check for more than I had to.  Just to cover another penalty just in case I had sent it during that time.  Pain in the ass.  The government is so freaking confusing.  The paperwork they send out.  Look, I just want to take care of the problem.  Stop fucking with me.  Just tell me, you know, step one, do this.  Step two, do this.  Step three, you know, put a stamp on your envelope. 
[00:11:00]  Horse with a clock in its stomach.  One skinny chicken.  And to mail letters.  The government allows you that.  To mail letters, it's like 37 cents now, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  I think so.  I wasn't sure.  I'm not even kidding.  Get the roll of stamps at home.  So I was dealing with that yesterday.  I got pulled over this morning on my way in.  That's why I was late.  It's a little late this morning.  The old lights put on me. 
[00:11:30]  And I come out of that Midtown Tunnel, right?  And it's kind of tricky over there.  When I'm making my right turn onto 3rd Avenue.  When you're making your illegal right turn onto 3rd Avenue.  Highly illegal turn.  What they've done, when you come out of the tunnel, and you want to make a right turn on 3rd Avenue,  they've divvied it up.  It's four lanes.  Two lanes are for going straight and not turning on 3rd.  The two other lanes to the right are for turning right on 3rd. 
[00:12:00]  And there's cones in between.  So you can't mix this up and try to, you know, edge in there.  If you're to the left of the cones, you better go straight.  If you're to the right of the cones, you better make your turn.  Light turns green, but it's a red arrow.  Which means now you can go straight.  You're not allowed to make the right turn yet.  There's no reason at 5.30 in the morning, almost 6 in the morning, that you shouldn't be able to make that right turn.  During midday, I could see why they do it. 
[00:12:30]  They allow the pedestrians' time to cross before all that tunnel traffic is making the right turn.  Because people would never be able to cross.  There'd be people getting hit.  It'd be crazy.  But at that hour, there's no pedestrians.  So what I do, there's a lot of people waiting to make that right turn.  I don't like waiting on that line.  So I go to the straight lanes, and then when the light turns green for me,  I make the sweeping right turn in front of all that traffic that has to wait for their arrow.  No problem.  I do it every morning. 
[00:13:00]  So I do it this morning.  I get all the way up now by 54th, which is quite a ways away from my illegal turn.  Quite a few blocks.  And there it is.  The lights.  Whoop, whoop.  Whoop, whoop, whoop.  Lights hit me.  Like, oh boy.  What did I do?  And I'm trying to think what I did, because I'm so far away from my illegal maneuver.  Uh, but, what I do, I promptly pull over.  And, uh, as they pull their car behind me, I'm already getting out all my stuff. 
[00:13:30]  I roll the window down.  I've got everything in hand, ready to give to the officer, uh, with my hands in plain view.  I don't make them nervous or anything.  I, I'm, I'm an easy pullover.  So, uh, he comes to the window.  I give him my license, uh, my registration and insurance, and I'm going in my wallet for my license.  And he goes, uh, sir, would you, uh, roll down your passenger window?  And I look, and there's another cop at my passenger side.  You know, they got that flashlight, and they're waiting just the, it's the other guy. 
[00:14:00]  It's the guy to intimidate you guy.  Because one cop isn't bad enough.  There's the other guy that's going to be, as you're making eye contact with the cop by your window,  he's just going to be searching your vehicle.  So, um, I roll the, the passenger window down.  And he goes, yeah, I don't want to miss anything funny.  Like, oh, bro.  And they both start laughing at me.  They both start laughing at me.  I'm the idiot.  They're all, like, nervous, pulled over, getting my stuff all ready. 
[00:14:30]  And, uh, yeah.  They go, we saw you make the turn.  And saw it was an escalade.  And, um, pulled up kind of close to me and said, yep, that's him.  And decided to have a little fun with me.  They waited all the way to 54th Street?  Yeah.  That's a, that's, that's like 20 some odd blocks from where you made the illegal right.  It's right by, uh, as a matter of fact, it was right by the planters that, uh, were blown up the other day, uh, in the, the bombing there.  Right.  So, uh, yeah.  So, uh, that was, uh, that was my fun this morning. 
[00:15:00]  That was my little shot of adrenaline.  It would have been great if they had a little baggie of weed and went and just dropped it in the passenger seat.  Wow!  Look what we got here!  Hey, uh, Anthony.  It looks like you got a taillight out.  They should have really fucked you up, man.  Start ransacking my car.  I want to do the back big bag of cocaine under the seat.  I want to encourage the NYPD, if, uh, you're really fans of this show, next time you see Anthony, really F him up. 
[00:15:30]  Stop it!  It's all cute.  You guys have done this, uh, with Anthony over the years, where you, how many times have they, you've been pulled over by a fan and they just mess with you for a while?  I've been pulled over a few times.  All right, the next time, guys, you got to really, really make it look good.  Knock out a taillight.  No.  Pull him out of the vehicle.  Start beating me on the sidewalk.  Tune, tune him.  I was going to say, tune him up a little bit.  No tune-ups.  Leave me alone.  They're a little too cute with the fake, uh, the fake pullovers with you. 
[00:16:00]  They got me this time, though.  The guy that came to the window was all business.  He, he didn't even crack a smile.  I, uh, I noticed he was definitely in the demo, you know?  He was a younger guy.  Um, younger white guy.  So he's definitely in the demo.  Yeah.  But he didn't crack a smile or anything.  It was all business.  And then he said to roll down the passenger window.  I'm like, oh, here's the other cop.  He's the one going to be looking.  I would love to answer the phones today, but we can't for some reason.  Looking for that roach in the ashtray when they do that. 
[00:16:30]  We have, uh, do it that way?  Hit it over there.  We got Chris the cop who, uh, pulled you over, Anthony.  Oh.  Chris!  Yo!  Oh, jeez.  Hold on, man.  What's wrong with the phone, Opie?  I don't know.  Where's Mars?  Did you guys test the phones this morning?  Uh-oh.  It crashed right as we, uh, went on the air.  Well, we want to get Chris the cop on the air here.  Yeah, right here.  Oh, right here?  Mars knows how to work this?  Watch.  Connect.  Desktop. 
[00:17:00]  Director.  No director.  Pick it up.  Pick it up.  Which one?  Chris the cop, line three.  Let's see.  That work?  All right, thank you.  Chris the cop, what's up, buddy?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, you bastards.  I was going to say, you know, uh, Anthony, you really didn't, uh, have too much to worry  about, because, you know, you're white.  You drive.  Oh, jeez.  Dude, relax.  Watch out.  We don't want to get you in trouble, buddy.  You guys, you scared the crap out of me. 
[00:17:30]  I'm trying to think of what I did wrong.  Well, it was funny, because, you know, we were watching the fact that, all right, you know,  here's this escalator that made this, uh, highly, as you said, illegal maneuver from  the third lane over, nearly, uh, you know.  I'm such an asshole.  Plus the fact that we had to chase it down for about 20 blocks.  By the time we get up to you, you're almost, uh, crashing into the car in front of you.  I was kind of speeding down third.  You know what it is?  You've got to make those lights.  They're all timed.  And sometimes those cabs get in my way, and they piss me off. 
[00:18:00]  Well, that's the only difference.  I mean, if your car was, uh, instead of a black one, it was a yellow one with a four-digit  license plate, it couldn't tell a difference between you or the other guy.  Yeah.  Hey, you know what I need?  I need one of those, uh, uh, beacons that I could put on top of my car.  Can you hook me up?  I want to turn on the siren and, uh, blast the escalator like I'm carrying Bloomberg with  me or something.  It's not really, it's really not that far-fetched, because over the years, Anthony has gotten some  very impressive stuff from the NYPD. 
[00:18:30]  I used to have one of the windshield, uh, placards that would go in there and get me  out of some, uh, parking.  Get you out of some major shit.  I live on Long Island now, so I don't have to worry about parking.  I, I mean, I got the, the cute, you know, uh, uh, uh, the PD, what the hell is it called?  Oh, the PBA card.  The PBA card.  Yeah, that's it.  I was going to say PDA.  He was expecting me to pull out.  He was expecting, he goes, I was expecting, like, ten PBA cards to come flying out the window.  The PBA card is, like, that's amateur stuff for Anthony.  He's, he pretty much has a cop uniform at this point.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jesus, not anymore. 
[00:19:00]  Hey, Chris, were you guys working it out when you were pulling me over, like, all right,  I'm going to get out.  I'll totally, uh, I'll get his, uh, license and Reggie and everything.  Yeah, I was, I was pretty much, I was going to play the straight guy, you know, having  the, uh, you know, I put the hat on, tried to get my pie all, uh, nice and, uh, you know,  uniform and, uh, all presentable and scare the hell out of you at first.  You're totally dead, man.  You totally got me.  I was, uh, I definitely thought I was getting a ticket.  Yeah, you guys got to tune him up next time, man.  Take him out of the car and work me over a little on the sidewalk. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, that would look good for our, uh, image.  All right.  Feeding the hell out of a motorist.  Well, Chris, uh.  What did he, what did he do wrong?  Did he throw a hand grenade?  No, he was just speeding a little bit.  So we had to teach him a lesson.  Yeah, he was following a cab a little too closely.  We had to, uh, show him who's boss.  Did they, did they catch the guy that, uh, planted the fake, uh, grenades there?  Uh, unfortunately, yeah, that's, uh, that's still pending.  Okay.  Yeah, they didn't catch him. 
[00:20:00]  All right, Chris.  Chris, uh, you're very funny.  Now go out there and, uh, be safe.  All right, thanks, man.  Take it in, man.  You'll be, you'll be safe.  Yeah, I know.  I'm such a dick when I drive.  That's awesome.  How great would it be if they dragged you to, just gave you a good plunger treatment?  Yeah, I don't know who.  Because you're crying and bleeding.  We're just kidding, man.  I love the show.  Plunger.  Uh, Sean from Staten Island.  What's up, Sean?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Good morning.  Good morning.  No, I was, uh, you guys remind me of a funny story that, uh, once happened to me. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, a funny story.  Hold on a second.  Did you say a funny story?  Oh.  Funny story.  Put your laughing hat.  Hold on, Danny Nathaniel.  You ready for a funny story in the audience?  Funny story.  I want you to sit down first, buddy.  Everybody, all right.  We're sitting by and ready for a funny story from Sean.  Okay.  Uh, no, I used to date this girl, and her father was a detective in Brooklyn.  And, uh, I was driving, you know, her home one night in Staten Island, and, uh, we get  pulled over by the cops.  And I didn't have, I didn't know why we got pulled over, you know, I had my seatbelt 
[00:21:00]  on, I was doing a speed limit and everything.  So I pull over, you know, and all of a sudden, you know, the cop comes on the PA, and he's  like, driver, turn the vehicle off.  So I turned the car off.  He's like, driver, with your right hand, take the keys out of the ignition, and drop the  keys out the window.  So I do the window, I drop them out of the window.  And he's like, driver, place both hands outside the window, and with your left hand, open  up the door from the outside of the vehicle.  So I do that.  He's like, okay, slowly get out of the vehicle and face towards the front of the vehicle. 
[00:21:30]  So I do that.  And then, uh, he's like, okay, very slowly walk backwards towards my voice.  So I walk back towards his voice.  I get to the back of the car.  He's like, okay, now get down on your knees, and lay flat on the ground with your hands  spread out.  So I do that.  So they come over to me, and he pats me down, and puts my hands behind my back, and locks  me up, and pulls me over, picks me up off the street, and walks me over to the cop car.  At this point, I never saw the cop's face, because I wasn't even looking at him or nothing  like that.  You know, so he sits me on the front of the car, and I turn around, and it's my girlfriend's 
[00:22:00]  father, just scaring the hell out of me.  Oh, come on.  I was so scared when he did that, man.  That was actually, it actually was a good story, but you kind of, when you said my girlfriend's  father's a cop, I kind of figured that was what was going to happen.  Right.  You know, the whole thing is, I was in Staten Island, and he works in Brooklyn, so I never  would have thought that it would have been him.  Oh, okay.  You know, if we were in Brooklyn, it would have been a different story, you know?  Actually, that's not a bad story at all. 
[00:22:30]  Thank you, Sean.  All right, guys, punch it up.  Bye, Angel.  Bye.  All right, we're going to take an early break today, because we're going to do something  a little different.  Brian Regan was at Caroline's over the weekend.  Oh, my God, the guy effing killed.  Oh, yeah.  I went Friday and Saturday night, and it was two different shows.  I'm kind of annoyed I didn't go.  Two completely different shows from Friday and Saturday night, and both were great.  People gave him a standing ovation at the end of the sets on Friday and Saturday  night.  It's just, he's one of those comics that, the audience is old people and young guys 
[00:23:00]  with piercings, it doesn't matter, and everyone's dying laughing the entire show.  There isn't one down moment.  There's just, you know, him doing his thing, and it's genius.  It's hysterical.  Yeah, my face hurt Saturday.  The guy woke up.  My face hurt from laughing so much.  One of the best comics working.  He might be the most, like, have the most, the biggest range of audience of anyone I've  ever seen before.  It's amazing.  It doesn't matter who goes in there and sits down, they're going to laugh at his shit. 
[00:23:30]  How the hell do you do that?  I know.  How do you do comedy like that?  The whole crowd, too.  The whole crowd.  Because usually you go to these comedy shows, and there's a bunch of people that stumble  into something, they're not really sure what they're getting themselves into, because maybe  there's one fan, and they bring friends in that just aren't digging the act.  But with Brian Regan, I'm always looking at the crowd a little bit here and there to  see what's going on.  There wasn't one person just sitting there with their arms folded going, this stinks.  Not one bad word.  Not one bit about sex at all.  I mean, I couldn't imagine doing something like that. 
[00:24:00]  It's amazing.  He is amazing to watch.  Because comics always hate clean comics.  But Regan is one guy who all comics agree on.  There's guys like Attell, Regan, Chappelle.  He's in that category of guys that people just look at and all comics even agree.  The guy is just fucking great.  Amazing.  He's a genius.  And he's always been funny, but it seems like he's really stepped up his game in the  last couple of years.  Because we had that little time off there.  And yeah, his new stuff, just as funny as the old stuff. 
[00:24:30]  It's not like, oh boy, I wish he would do his old stuff.  All the new stuff is drop-dead funny, hysterical.  Who was he with?  Do you remember?  Do you know who was on the show?  Pete Correale, who was really funny.  He did a great set as the middle.  And God, I can't remember the first guy.  And he was really good, too.  And he was trying to sell a CD after the gig, too.  We'll find out his name.  He gave me a smart card.  I've got to give him a plug.  Oh, you did?  Brad Trackman.  Yeah, Brad Trackman.  He was pretty funny, too.  Yeah, I've known Brad for a long time.  It was actually just a good show from beginning to end. 
[00:25:00]  A lot of times, there's a couple hacks and then the headliner.  But, you know, Correale was rocking pretty good over the weekend, too.  Yeah, he was really funny.  So, well, we want to do something a little different.  Brian Regan, he did our show, what, Friday, I guess?  And he taped Letterman on Thursday night.  Was that the deal?  Or, I don't know.  Whatever.  He flew in Monday for that.  I think he said Friday.  Oh, okay.  But, Brian Regan's been a friend of ours for many, many years.  Many years.  And he was on Letterman last night.  And we'll probably get in trouble for this, but what the hell. 
[00:25:30]  Brian Regan on David Letterman on Friday night.  Our next guest is a very funny gentleman.  And I have here a copy of his new DVD entitled, I Walked on the Moon.  Ah.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome back to the show, Brian Regan.  Brian Regan.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Wow, you guys sound great.  I'm feeling good. 
[00:26:00]  I just had my annual physical with my doctor.  And I was nervous going because my cholesterol.  I knew it was going to be high because last year it was high.  And I hadn't done anything different.  What are the odds your cholesterol is going to plummet for no reason?  Come on, 200.  Come on.  337.  How can that be?  I had Burger King coupons in my pocket. 
[00:26:30]  It's inexplicable.  So I was nervous going.  And I realized that's the only time as an adult that I feel like a little kid.  Because when I go to the doctor, you didn't do what I told you, did you?  No, no, I didn't.  What should you have done?  I should have listened when you were talking to me.  What are you going to do from now on?  Pay attention when you say things.  When are you going to start?  I'm going to start right now.  Tall doctor.  First thing he said when he walked into the office. 
[00:27:00]  Hey, Brian, you should probably drop a couple pounds.  Oh, hey, how are you?  How have you been?  Only your doctor has carte blanche on insults.  He just pummeled you with insults and you're paying for all the insults on the way out.  Well, you should lose some weight and those moles are looking pretty weird.  All right, how much for that, doc?  When can we get together again?  Big fat mole man walking out of your office. 
[00:27:30]  Thanks for the confidence boost.  I'm off to the Macy's Day parade.  Grab a rope!  What does he care?  Thanks.  Thank you.  Thank you.  But he does care because doctors are good people, man.  That's why they avoid the word pain.  They don't want to scare anybody, so they don't use the word pain.  Doctors will tell you all about pressure.  If a doctor tells you you're about to feel some pressure, buckle up. 
[00:28:00]  In a moment, you're going to feel a little bit of pressure.  Hey, that pressure hurt like hell!  All pain involves pressure.  You could be swinging a two-by-four at your head.  In a moment, you're going to feel a little bit of pressure.  Hey, bring it on.  I'm good under pressure.  I like pressure situations.  So I told my doctor that I get heartburn sometimes. 
[00:28:30]  So he goes and gets me a list of things that cause heartburn.  I'm looking at the list and I'm like,  I already know this.  I know how to get it.  That's like going into the hospital with a cannonball wound  and they show you a list.  Here's how you get cannonball wounds. 
[00:29:00]  I already...  I have a cannonball wound.  It's gaping.  Do you have a tube of cannonball wound ointment?  I mean, I think doctors say things that they'll never think about the rest of their life 
[00:29:30]  and you'll wonder forever what they were talking about.  My dentist, he's getting ready to work on me.  He goes, Brian, I need for you to relax your lower lip for me, please.  Why don't you go ahead and relax your lower lip?  Well, I've gone an entire lifetime  without even beginning to wonder how I might relax my lower lip.  So I wanted to go ahead and relax it now.  I'm just like...  Now you're tensing it.  I need you to relax it.  I'm trying to find the brain cell that controls that.  There we go. 
[00:30:00]  Let me just lay it on my chest for you.  Give you a nice wide open work area.  What the hell are you talking about relaxing my lower lip?  You relax your lower lip and tell me how you did it.  How do you relax your lower lip?  What do you tuck it in your shirt pocket?  Sometimes you just want to relax.  You guys are great, man.  Thank you very much.  Brian Regan, Opie and Anthony, XM Radio. 
[00:30:30]  I don't have any verbs.  I don't have any verbs.  Now you know that you're mine.  And you know that you're mine. 
[00:31:00]  All right.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  There were a couple of tools at the Regan show.  The second show.  I stayed for both shows on Friday.  And first show, the audience was great.  Second show.  A couple of tools up in the back. 
[00:31:30]  Just one guy yelling,  O and A!  Opie and Anthony O and A!  Why are you yelling that out at the comic?  Why are you yelling that?  What possible response could you be expecting?  Aside from,  Shut up!  I just,  Some comics,  you just shouldn't heckle.  Yeah.  The one guy was ruining it on Saturday night  by saying congratulations to everything Brian said.  Oh, really?  And then,  so Brian had to do about 10 or 15 minutes of improv 
[00:32:00]  to get through that,  you know,  maybe 10 minutes to get through that whole heckling thing.  And you know,  he still pulled it off  because he's a really good comic,  a very funny guy in general.  Yeah.  But he has prepared material  that he really wants to get to.  And it's kind of like,  I was describing this to someone over the weekend,  it's kind of like going to see Zeppelin  and all of a sudden Zeppelin  is not allowed to do any of their songs,  but they're going to still give you a good show  because they're just great musicians,  you know what I mean?  But they're just going to jam.  But you still want to hear going to California  and, you know, 
[00:32:30]  what have you.  Uh-huh.  And that's what's so frustrating  because even though he pulled it off  and did a great job,  that was probably 5 to 10 minutes of,  you know,  time that he could have done  one of his brilliant bits.  What's congratulations?  Is that one of his old bits?  Or is that...  Well, no,  the guy, you know,  Brian goes,  I have a new, you know,  baby, a toddler running around.  And so the guy's like,  congratulations.  And it was funny.  So Brian's like,  oh, thank you, whatever.  But then everything that Brian said,  like that,  the guy had to say congratulations.  Oh.  Just another guy who wants to be funny.  It's awful. 
[00:33:00]  Man.  It's awful.  Now, how you don't just, like,  carry a gun with you  and shoot them in the head.  They're the hard ones to deal with  because you want to smash them,  but you know, like,  that they're just having fun  and they're trying to be funny  and they're not trying to mess you up.  Those are the hard ones  because it's easier  when someone's just heckling you  than when you can just attack them  and hopefully him  and his awful party leave.  Right.  But when they're just chiming in  and trying to be like,  you know,  they're looking at their dates.  Look at me.  Yeah.  And Brian is so accommodating  that instead of pretty much  yelling at the guy  to shut the fuck up, 
[00:33:30]  I got cool stuff here for you,  you know,  he goes with it,  you know,  because he doesn't want  to offend anybody.  But it gets frustrating  for everybody else  that goes and knows the comic  and knows that he has  just a ton of material  that he can pick from  and instead he's doing  a little improv for everybody.  There are certain comics  like Voss  that, you know,  just eat that shit up.  Yeah.  Somebody yells something  from the crowd  and Voss will turn around  and just make them look stupid  and it'll be hysterically funny.  Well, it's called crowd work,  you know.  Brian doesn't really do crowd work.  No.  You know,  he's got a lot of  really, really funny bits 
[00:34:00]  that some of them are,  you know,  10, 15 minutes long.  That everybody wants to hear  and they don't want to hear  the heckler guy.  Ugh.  Right.  Shut up.  Exactly.  Nothing to work.  It's just irritating.  Just they want to be funny guys.  Someone told them they're funny.  They secretly resent you  for being up there  and getting the attention  that they're not getting.  Their chick is laughing  at stuff you're saying  and he's looking all pissed.  It's amazing to watch them.  Even from the stage  in the cellar  where it's really small,  you can see  how people will react  at times. 
[00:34:30]  They get resentful  that you're up there  and you can tell  usually a tone  when someone's heckling you.  But it's the eyes.  There's a confrontation there.  Really?  Yeah.  Sometimes they're trying  to be funny  but you know  what they want to do  is derail you  because they're sabotaging  the scumbags.  His head is the level  of your foot.  You can just walk over  and punt his skull.  That'd be great.  Not for the cellar though.  It's the same height  pretty much as the thing.  But if I'm paralyzed  you give him a good boot  right in the head.  Just boot him  right in the head.  Nick DiPaolo would.  He punched a heckler  in the face.  Years ago he came in the cellar  with a broken hand. 
[00:35:00]  I'm like,  what happened?  He's like,  punch the heckler.  Nick is an animal.  He really is.  He is just an angry  Boston animal.  That's awesome.  Just before the show  we were walking  into the studio  and I was asking Jimmy  how his weekend was  and stuff.  He goes,  I had a massage  last night.  You would love her.  Which means  that's code for  she doesn't do  anything sexual.  Oh really?  We have different ways  of looking at massages.  I actually go for  legitimate massages  just to mellow out  and whatever  get some stress out.  And Jimmy 
[00:35:30]  can't be bothered  with that  if a girl's not  whacking him  by the end of it  it's a waste of time.  I go to get  something else out.  Something more tangible.  But I did think  I was on a certain  place looking for  masseuses  and I knew  it was a legit massage.  A lot of them  post like  therapeutic.  And I'm like,  ah, let me go  because it seemed  like reasonable.  I called her  and she was nice  but she sounded  a little older.  Oh yeah?  And I get there  and it's like  after my set  and it's like  eleven o'clock.  A quarter of eleven  I show up. 
[00:36:00]  Because she runs  a chiropractor's office  which should have  told me  they usually  don't whack you  off.  There's like  degrees on the wall.  Degrees on the wall.  She opens the door  for the thing  and she's fifty.  She's wearing a  black blouse  and black  like lady slacks.  And I'm like,  ugh.  Why didn't you  just turn away  at that point?  I knocked on one door  but it was a couple  doors down  so I called her  and she opened the door  and looked out  and I almost ran.  I was like,  I should just turn around  and just act like  I'm just going away.  Yeah.  But I'm like,  be a person,  get the massage. 
[00:36:30]  So I go in there  and her other client  is still in there  with her.  And oh,  they're having a chat.  This is awful.  When you want to lust  and you want to be a pig  you want to be alone  with the lady.  And this guy's talking  and he's like,  oh,  my back feels better.  She has him walking  around the office.  She's like,  put your arms above your head.  He's like,  alright.  He's putting his arms  above his head  and then he's like,  you gotta talk  to my fiance.  He calls his fiance  and this lady is like,  I want to have a cigarette.  So she opens the main door.  She's smoking a Kent.  A Kent cigarette. 
[00:37:00]  A Kent.  Who smokes Kent?  And no one under 48.  I'm standing there  holding the door open.  She's smoking a Kent  talking to this awful woman  while this guy  just kind of stands there  and smiles  at this whole experience.  Ten minutes  I'm in the doorway.  I want to strangle  both of them.  I'm like,  there's no way  you're getting a load off here.  And I wind up going in  and just...  But why?  At that point  you know nothing's  going to happen.  Because I'm like,  you know what?  I've had some foot pain  in the right ear.  I'm like,  just get the massage.  You're here.  And it was only like  95 bucks  which is a very fair price 
[00:37:30]  for an hour  of real massage.  And she seemed to know  what she was talking about.  So she does weird stuff.  She doesn't just massage you.  At first she works  on your joints.  You know what I mean?  Does real tendon work.  So the gal let me do it.  And it was actually very good.  She did me  for almost two hours.  She wouldn't let me  off the table  because she's like,  you're not done yet.  And she was like,  fixing my ankles  and my heels.  Really?  Yeah, 95 bucks.  I think she wanted  a little tip  so I gave her like 150  because she really  worked really hard  and she was great.  But it was kind of  annoying at the same time.  But she was the first  masseuse I ever wanted me 
[00:38:00]  to stay under the towel.  Yeah.  Yeah, I took a Viagra  before I went.  Oh no.  I do that sometimes.  I like to turn over  and just not have to  ask for anything.  It's like,  you know what's going on.  Let's earn our tips, sweetie.  So were you rocking?  Well, my nose, no.  When you turned over?  No, my nose was really  stuffed.  That happens sometimes.  I took a half of a 50  so that's 25 milligrams  and I'm laying on my stomach  and it was still  like a wilted wet mushroom.  I was so not in a sexual vibe.  When she showed me the towels, 
[00:38:30]  I'm like, good,  I don't want to be naked.  I didn't want to even have anything  and she was completely legit.  Yeah.  But it was weird  getting a real massage.  This is how,  if I'm going to get massaged,  this is who has to do it  because for me,  I'm such a,  a guy would creep me out.  I couldn't have that  unless it was strictly  a foot massage  or something,  upper back  and a woman,  I can't have to do it  because I'm a complete filth ball.  Sure.  This is who has to do it.  She has to be 50.  Smoking kents.  Smoking kents.  I went to pee at one point  because I had to whiz  like an hour into it  and she goes out  and she has a kent again. 
[00:39:00]  She comes in,  she smells like smoke.  Oh, reeking of kents.  Yeah,  but she was still  really good though, man.  She gave a very good massage  and she like made sure,  she was bending my,  she had her knee on my leg  and she's stretching it.  She said she's trying  to lengthen my leg  because my one leg  is shorter than the other.  That sounds like  some kind of quackery.  I completely agree,  but it was still a very,  it was still good  for massage purposes.  Yeah.  However,  I don't feel any taller.  Lengthen your leg.  How about the one  in the middle, lady?  That's the leg.  I once went  and got a massage.  You just remind me 
[00:39:30]  of something  because some of these people  are kind of kooky.  Oh, yeah.  And, you know,  getting a massage  for stress relief,  it really works for me  and I like it  from time to time,  all right?  I went to this one lady once  and she wanted me  to see golden lights.  What?  And so I'm trying  to have an open mind  because of it,  you know,  they're massaging you  but then they're pushing  the pressure points  or whatever.  Yeah.  So she would do it  with like some kind  of pressure point  on my wrist  and then the other wrist  and then that was supposed  to make me see  some kind of golden light  in my chest  and she would be over me 
[00:40:00]  going,  all right,  when you see the golden light,  nod your head.  So I'm like,  I have my eyes closed  and I'm trying  to have an open mind  like,  all right,  maybe I'll see  some golden lights  and then it's like  just way too long.  Nothing is happening,  obviously,  and nothing is going  to happen  and now I'm in  a weird position.  I'm like,  do I tell her  nothing's happening?  Will she get all stressed  down and freaked out?  So do you lie?  Of course I lied.  Also, I'm nodding  and she's like,  that's very good.  Okay.  And then she like  was doing something  with my forehead  and I don't know, 
[00:40:30]  like in the middle  of my chest,  she goes,  do you see the golden light  in the middle of your chest?  I'm like,  I would wait  just enough time.  Yeah,  when should I be seeing it?  Probably now.  I started counting  in my head,  one,  one hundred,  two,  one hundred,  three,  one hundred,  golden light,  nod,  yes,  very good.  And then she wanted me  to see a golden pyramid  from my,  I'm trying to remember  all this,  but from my forehead.  What a bunch of kooks.  Back down to my shoulder blades  and across to make  a perfect pyramid.  I'm like,  yes,  I see that.  She's like,  very good. 
[00:41:00]  I don't know.  I forget.  This was a few years back.  They just want to make  something more  of what they do  than what they do.  Yeah.  Just massage.  There's no golden light,  you quack.  You don't want to see  this golden squat over me  and let me have it.  There's the golden light.  Give me asparagus breath.  There's no golden light.  Does anyone ever  fess up to this lady?  I don't know,  but it put me  in an uncomfortable situation.  My shoulder blade  hurts,  you idiot.  Right. 
[00:41:30]  Tell me about golden lights.  Just rub.  But there I am  just nodding on the table.  Yes,  I see it.  All right,  good,  good,  good.  You're almost healed.  A couple more.  She's probably like,  look,  another idiot  that can't tell me  I don't see it.  Well,  you want to shut them up  and just have they move on  and massage properly.  Because the actual massage,  when they're working,  it feels good and all,  right?  But when they're doing  this stupid golden light crap,  all they're doing  is pushing pressure points  and you know  the clock is ticking  in your head.  Like,  I got an hour massage  and she just wasted  ten minutes  so I could see 
[00:42:00]  some stupid golden light.  Yeah.  It's an experience.  We have to relax you.  You have to shut your face.  Yeah.  Just get the kinks  out of my lower back.  Screw the freaking,  you know,  golden light.  Rub,  tug,  get out.  Oh,  yeah,  this is the music they play.  Are you seeing the  usually with water  playing?  Do you see the golden lights?  Let me rub here.  I'm going to put my finger  on your forehead  and my thumb  up your ass.  You're probably going to see  a bright white flash  when I do this  and feel a little pain. 
[00:42:30]  Is this Yanni?  Yeah,  I know this crap.  Oh,  how do you know this?  I wouldn't have known  that was him  if he was playing  it on the console here.  I'll tell you,  this is from one of the  coolest albums ever.  Stop it.  As far as this music goes,  I've got to preface it.  Why,  this is on Houses of the Holy?  Better be.  This is from  You just said that.  This is from an album  called  Keys to the Imagination?  Oh.  Keys to the Imagination. 
[00:43:00]  I'll tell you why.  Most people should know  this music, actually,  because there's other  tracks on here  that ABC Sports,  NBC Sports,  CBS Sports,  ESPN Sports,  all use when they're  doing highlight reels  and stuff,  and intro and outros  to some of their  sports programming.  Sounds like the  background music  in one of those  rides you go on  on Epcot.  The Wonders of the World.  Sit back and enjoy.  Sponsored by Monsanto.  Monsanto.  Welcome back to 1968.  Thank God. 
[00:43:30]  Wow.  Your favorite comedy show  done by Texaco and?  Mike from New Jersey.  What's up, Mike?  The Living Seeds.  What's up, Mike?  That whole golden triangle  thing's bullshit.  I had the same thing myself.  I think those people  just have nothing better  to do,  so they just act like,  you know,  there's going to be  a golden light,  and they go home,  and they're like,  yeah,  I made two other  assholes today  say that they saw  the golden light.  Of course.  You think,  all right,  yeah,  okay,  maybe they're  playing us.  Exactly.  They are.  You look like an idiot  because you're sitting there  like,  I see it, 
[00:44:00]  I see it,  and they know  it's not there.  How about this?  Oh, go ahead,  the woman I went to  last night,  I would say,  like,  the whole stretching  the leg thing,  but the only thing  that kind of impressed  me about her  is when I walked in,  I mean,  this guy didn't know me,  I didn't know him,  he put her on the phone  with the fiancee,  and he was telling me  this fiancee's a surgeon  or a doctor,  and he's had some neck problems,  and I listened to this woman  smoking her Kent  and talking about  muscles in the neck  and, like,  the third and fourth  thing in the spine,  and she was having,  like,  a real medical conversation  with the surgeon,  yeah,  about what was wrong  with this guy, 
[00:44:30]  so she knew  what she was doing.  You think the guy,  like,  had to call the fiancee?  Something was going on there,  where it was like,  look,  you could go to  the massage place,  but you better have  that bitch call me,  and she better know  her shit  to make sure the guy  isn't going to  a Yankee Cranky place.  I don't know  if it was that direct,  but I thought  there was something weird,  like,  he couldn't wait  to put the,  I think he's probably  gotten caught doing  something,  or gotten caught cruising,  and he still wants to go,  and she's like,  alright,  and he was so proud  that he actually got  a legit one,  he was like,  here,  talk to her,  prove it. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah,  there was a trust issue  going on there  between that guy  and his woman.  Yeah,  I was going to say,  that guy reminded me  of something else,  too.  I was going to a dentist  for a while  that was like  one of these  natural dentists.  Uh-oh.  Didn't believe in,  like,  you know,  painkillers.  What?  I mean,  he would do the Novocaine,  but then,  you know,  I had some serious,  like,  tooth pain  after the procedures  and stuff,  and he made me,  like,  chew down on roots  and all sorts of crap  instead of giving me...  How about Vicodin? 
[00:45:30]  Exactly,  instead of giving me  legitimate medicine,  he's like,  he's like,  you know,  prescribing his,  like,  his weeds  and his...  Roots!  ...and his natural pills  and it didn't work for shit.  Get out of here.  Give me the drugs.  Like,  that's all well and good,  but you're a dentist.  That's great.  You're back in the 1800s.  Right!  Now,  they've come up with  some really good drugs for pain.  Give them to me.  I'm trying to remember,  and I had them all  in my medicine cabinet  with all these weird names  and none of that crap worked. 
[00:46:00]  Of course it doesn't work.  You need stuff  that you swallow  in a pill  and it goes to your brain  and shuts down  the pain receptors.  Just shuts them off.  Not roots.  What's a root gonna do?  Chewing on a root  like some savage.  I think homeopathic stuff  is great  and natural stuff  is great,  but for immediate things  you gotta go  with Western medicine.  For pain,  you gotta go...  Of course you do.  I mean,  if it's like a condition  that can be worked out  over time,  I think that kind of stuff  can work really well.  I was watching a great thing  last night 
[00:46:30]  about a guy  who was injured  in some CIA raid.  He was a CIA guy  and he said  that the natives  had this awful burn  stuff they put on.  Yeah.  It was like,  you know,  this cream.  This was in the Congo  in the 60s  and they said  the CIA tested it  and it was actually  as good as the best  stuff medicine had.  So once in a while  they hit it.  Yeah,  natural stuff works.  Yeah.  It's all snake grease  and that kind of shit.  Snake grease.  But it's like,  you got pain, man.  You got to take a pill.  Of course you do.  Well,  I'm going to try  the acupuncture next.  That's actually helpful.  I used to go for that.  No,  it's not bad.  Why are you doing that? 
[00:47:00]  I'm just going to try it.  For what?  Have you seen  that I'm not as intense,  Anthony?  Not even for a pain somewhere?  For a stress thing?  I don't know.  I'm just going to go  for just like,  I don't know,  overall health  and maybe to sleep better.  Really?  And maybe,  I don't have as much stress  in my life,  so maybe not for the stress anymore.  Pins.  Yeah,  I'm going to give it a shot.  What the hell?  I've done it.  It works.  Yeah?  I've done it.  I got a guy I'll recommend for you  that I used to go to in Chinatown.  He's phenomenal.  Of course.  And it's like regular doctors, 
[00:47:30]  a lot of them acknowledge acupuncture,  like they can't even ignore it.  A lot of them are MDs.  Supposedly,  yeah,  it's the real deal.  Yeah.  Western medicine is finally acknowledging  that there's something there.  It's all very vague  on how it works.  It's all very vague.  I'll give you a full report.  I'll be honest.  Some specifics.  I didn't see the golden lights.  I wasn't going to come on the air  and make believe  I saw stupid golden lights  and I'm telling you  the root crap from the dentist  didn't work.  So I'll give you a full report  on the acupuncture crap.  When he would put needles  in certain parts of me,  I would get numb  in other parts.  Like my,  when he was doing like whatever, 
[00:48:00]  like on the arm or whatever,  he put them up.  They usually don't hurt either.  Not even a teeny twinge,  but I would feel like  part of my right thigh.  Really,  he was telling me  that blood flow was happening  and the needle  was nowhere near there.  So I felt,  yeah,  there was something weird going on.  When I put them under  you're occasionally,  you get one  where the nail meets your skin.  Are you a fingernail?  Are you kidding me?  They stick one there?  Only under,  like occasionally,  it's very rare  that you'll get them.  That's a torture.  It only hurts for a second.  It only hurts for a second.  But there's like  a couple of reasons  because that's like 
[00:48:30]  a real jump start.  Like once in a while  you got to do that,  but it's rare.  Get out of here.  I hear it's very relaxing,  is it?  Well, for me,  it's so hard to lay there  and relax.  Right where your nail  emerges from your finger.  Yeah,  it was either on the foot  or the hand.  I got a couple of those.  Rare.  I used to get like  three in the head  or two in the head.  Didn't hurt.  One in the middle of the head.  That golden light stuff  is probably all based  on certain real pressure points  in acupuncture  that these quacks take  and think they can use  their thumb  to do something.  You know,  the Chinese have been doing it  for 2,500 years.  I mean,  there's something to it.  Yeah. 
[00:49:00]  I mean,  they are pretty healthy,  young looking folks.  Communists.  Let's go to Corey.  SD,  is that South Dakota  or San Diego?  Yeah, I'll deck.  South Dakota?  Yeah, South Dakota.  One of them roots  that you're talking about  is the echinacea root.  Yeah.  It goes down here  along the White River  and it works.  But it's got to be fresh.  Oh, the echinacea?  Yeah,  you can't let it all dry out  and get all scabby  and shit.  It don't work then.  But if you get it fresh  while it's moist,  you chew on that 
[00:49:30]  and it numbs  your whole mouth.  I mean,  right now.  That's got to be good  for when you're sick too,  right?  You eat it when you're sick  because echinacea  is good for that stuff.  Yeah,  it's really good.  It works.  Right down here  is one of the only places  left in the world  that it's growing  on its own.  All right.  Thank you, Corey.  Pfizer's growing it.  I don't want it.  Jay in the city.  What's going on, fellas?  It's nothing real.  Hey, Jay.  Hey, listen.  I wanted to address  Jimmy's leg problem.  You know,  there actually is  such a thing  called a leg length discrepancy  and it usually is a result 
[00:50:00]  of what's called  a functional scoliosis  which means you just have  a compression on one  side of your spine  and usually  your hip shifts  and it makes your leg  look like it's shorter  but it's actually not.  It's just a shift  of your pelvic aspect  as it relates to your spine.  That was actually  what she was saying.  She was talking about  the pelvis has to be  like a little loose  and she said a lot  about the hip.  That was exactly  like what you're saying.  It was almost like  she was trying to stretch  the muscle  or whatever in the pelvis,  the leg muscle a little bit  and just kind of relax it.  I had the same thing  from training in martial arts. 
[00:50:30]  Let me tell you  I had this girl  sticking her elbow  up my ass practically  to break up my  you know the musculature  or whatever it relates.  I saw for sure  she was trying to  just shove the table up there.  I didn't want to turn around  and say it.  It was crazy  but it definitely works.  You just got to go  a few times  to get that thing loosened up.  She said everyone's got  like a little leg discrepancy  as far as like  an eighth or a quarter  of an inch of length  and I felt that my right leg  is a little shorter.  Easily.  Which I felt it  like I could stand there straight  and I could feel  that my left leg  has to bend a little  to accommodate  my awful short right leg.  But you don't limp  when you walk around.  Oh no it's not like 
[00:51:00]  a two foot difference  but it's just like a  polio kid.  Dude that's how  you should walk out  on stage  like one leg  shorter than the other.  That would be hilarious.  But it is  like you can feel it.  My leg's all stiff  and happy  and the left one's bending.  Let's go to Philly.  Hey Joe.  Hello P.  Anthony, Jimmy Norton.  How are you boys doing?  How do you do Joe?  We're just warming up  I guess for today.  Oh this is  I don't know  you might remember me  Joe from Philly. 
[00:51:30]  I've hung out with you  a couple times.  Yes.  What's going on man?  Oh the Joe.  What's up Joe?  Okay well  I just wanted to let you  have an idea  who you're talking to.  I get acupuncture  all the time  because I have  that rheumatoid arthritis  and that muscle  problem shit.  When I get my acupuncture  they'll put three needles  in the gooch  underneath my ball bag.  Stop it.  I swear to God  it's that  next time Jimmy  if you go  or when you go  ask the doctors  about it.  Not a lot of doctors 
[00:52:00]  in the you know  I'm not taking needles  to my taint Joe.  It doesn't hurt though  does it?  Not one bit.  I'm petrified in needles  and getting acupuncture  is the greatest thing  I've ever done.  But getting the needles  to the taint  what does that take care of?  It's all connected  dude there's a map  if you ask them  to look for it  you can probably  look it up on the website  of like all these lines  that run up and down  the body and crazy shit  and yeah it's  I don't know dude  the whole body  just feels  the best way to describe it 
[00:52:30]  is when somebody  releases the air  out of a tire  you know when you  push the stem  the needle  it just feels like  shit's blowing out  of the needle tip.  Yeah well you know  something you should  absolutely know  what is affected  by getting needles  in your taint  because if the  if the acupuncturist  said alright  I'm going to stick  these needles here  wouldn't you ask  hey what does that do?  I don't know man  you just kind of  go with it  because I'm afraid  of needles  so I just lay down  you know and just  and close my eyes 
[00:53:00]  and try and fall asleep.  Jesus Christ.  Alright boys  you guys have a good day  take it easy.  Alright later Joe.  No way  no way am I  taking needles  to my taint  into your taint  without knowing  absolutely why  he's doing this.  Why are you  sticking needles  in my taint?  I'll take a couple  to the head maybe  maybe around the elbow  I don't know  where else?  Anywhere  the taint is bad  especially if you get  the face one  where it was  in someone else's taint  the next thing you know  the needle's under your nose  I can't really  leave this needle 
[00:53:30]  in a pile of onions  Yeah well  do they sterilize  all these things?  Yeah  I don't know  I'll find out  The needle's like  Chinese  they don't do it  it goes in like  an eighth of an inch  and the way they do it  is he'll do some  rubbing thing  and then twist it in  and you don't even feel  it's very light  and he'll tap you  a little bit  it's great  this guy was like  a third generation  acupuncturist  that I went to  he was Asian  I don't want a white guy  or a black guy  I want him Asian  Yeah  I'm like  in front of his pants  no bulge whatsoever 
[00:54:00]  I'm like  go ahead  stick it in my arm  no expression  no nothing  I couldn't tell  if he was screaming at me  or just quietly dozing off  We're gonna put the  Pat O'Brien thing  to bed I guess  Yeah  the remixes and stuff  Maybe we should play  a couple of our favorites  before we retire this bit  but we got a couple  new ones  that came in  over the weekend  The first one's really long  I didn't get to  pre-listen to this one  It's Pat O'Brien  and Ant's daughter Lynn  Huh?  Who?  Remember Lynn? 
[00:54:30]  Lynn  Ant has a stalker too  by the way  You should Ant's daughter  She's from Boston  Well that's the problem  I know Ant doesn't have  an actual daughter  but this girl Lynn  I know Eric  This girl Lynn  called up one day  thinking Ant  was her father  I remember her  Yeah she called up  and was calling me dad  and oh stop it  and she was  not even like you know  daddy trying to be sexual  she actually  thought I was her father  or something  and it would have worked out 
[00:55:00]  where I would have  been like 8 years old  and had a kid  Yeah but she was convinced  absolutely convinced  she was a complete kook  and we haven't heard from her  in quite a while  Lunatic  Well we should call now kid  because daddy's doing well  financially  There you go  Call up  you and Cosby's daughter  should hang out  Where are you?  We got the nanny though  from nanny 111  9911  111  That doesn't sound like  much of an emergency  Nanny from 911  I'm sorry  Nanny Yvonne right? 
[00:55:30]  Hello  Good morning gentlemen  Hello  Good morning  Hello  Or have I got  the wrong station  No you've got  the right station  Why do you say that?  Love the accent  Good morning gentlemen  Yes gentlemen  We are truly gentlemen  Alright then  Okay I'll give you a break  Well I watch the show  Opie  I watch nanny 911  I find it hysterically funny  Some of these families  are completely dysfunctional 
[00:56:00]  and I don't know how  within  How long do you stay  at the house?  We're probably there  about 10 days  between 7 and 10 days  Within 10 days  they turn these  this husband and wife  that pretty much  can't stand each other  and little monsters  that are running around  the house  into the perfect  little family  Isn't that lovely?  It is lovely  I wish I could  remember now  I've got to tell you  all of you nannies  it might sound like  I'm a nanny racist  but you all look  and sound alike  Well that's because  we're all British  They're all British 
[00:56:30]  very well to do  and which families  have you handled?  Maybe that will give me  a line on which one  No it probably won't  actually because  this is my first show  coming up tonight  Oh you're a brand new nanny  Yes they're breaking me in  with a big show  that's on tonight  I actually have been  on the beginning  of each show  but this is my first show  we are doing another series  we're filming over the summer  so you'll see me  back in September  So what's the problem  with the family  that you go to tonight? 
[00:57:00]  Well actually  there's 23 boys  with special needs  I saw  I saw  I saw the trailer  for this one  That's terrific  That's terrific  I saw the trailer  for this one  You got like  there's a family  that adopted  23 boys  Yes  She actually adopted  32  but there's 23  on the show  And they're all  special needs  All special needs  And you are being  brought in  to help  What problem?  It seems to me  like if you adopt  that many special needs 
[00:57:30]  kids you kind of  know what you need  to do  Well can you guess  what the problem is?  They needed a break  A break  So you're going to  now stand in  and do what they  normally do  on a daily basis  so maybe they can  go out and have  a cigarette?  Well yeah  a little bit more  than that I think  Yeah  Just bring over  a gallon of glue  you'll be fine  Super glue  Yes we'll super glue them  No it was  very interesting  and they needed a break  The dad's  actually in a wheelchair  as well  He's a paraplegic  Oh my goodness 
[00:58:00]  Are you insane?  No I'm  I'm telling you  the truth  And this is your  first outing?  It was my first outing  but I've got a  handicapped brother  and I've worked  with handicapped  children before  Oh really?  Fantastic  I can't believe  that you're finding  this so funny  Well no that's  Robert De Niro  finding it hysterically  funny  Oh it's Robert De Niro  Oh I see  Yeah yeah  And that's Opie  finding things  hysterically funny  Well are there  any uncomfortable  moments that we  might find  hysterically funny 
[00:58:30]  in tonight's episode?  You'll have to watch  I dealt with dinner  one night  and you know  dad Jim  runs it like  a tight ship  I don't think  I had quite  the sails on right  I mean it was  it was  it was pretty busy  put it that way  but it was  a lot of fun  I took some  of the kids  surfing  Hey I liked  you took them  surfing?  I did  You're a surfing  nanny?  Well I am now  Oh okay  so you don't  surf but you  took them there  to surf  I went in  I got up 
[00:59:00]  on a surfboard  Nanny don't surf  Yay  Nannies do surf  Where do you  shoot the show?  That was in  California  Oh you do  shoot the stage  okay  How do they  do surfing?  How what?  Sorry?  How did the  special needs  children do  surfing?  Well some of  them you know  obviously not  the ones in  the wheelchairs  but we did  take some  of the ones  that were able  to and they  were actually  better than me  at it  so that was  embarrassing  I've actually  never seen  the show  but a buddy  of mine  like has  seen it 
[00:59:30]  Are you  going to  watch it  tonight?  I absolutely  will  but he said  that like  there's some  really funny  moments  but then like  by the end  a lot of  times you  know you're  like wow  because things  are like boom  Yeah  literally  we're there  for like  10-12 hours  a day  Really?  And you  do see a  difference  there is a  difference  Like boom  yeah  Yeah  a lot of  times even  though there's  humor with it  you do see  some kind  of an  improvement  as opposed  to like  you know  like whatever  was like  you know  the first  thing  That's why  I think  the show  is so popular  because you  know you're 
[01:00:00]  learning something  but it's also  a lot of fun  I mean you do  there is a lot  of moments  where people  find it  entertaining  I had two  of the moments  that were my  favorites from  the show  had to be  the cursing  little girl  Oh wasn't  she bad  Yeah this is  a couple weeks  back  There was a  little girl  she had to  be maybe  four  I guess  four years  old  and she  would use  the F word  and call  her mother  a fat F  fat fuck  Yeah  Wonder where  she got it  from  Yeah and the  parents are  completely  they were both 
[01:00:30]  just very nasty  to each other  they actually  brought in  a marriage  nanny  after that  and then another  one of my  favorite moments  was the  young boy  who wasn't  potty trained  and the mother  would take him  outside the house  to just piss  all around the  house  in the flowers  the fire hydrant  down the street  as the neighbors  watch  and somehow  I don't know how  but the nannies  seem to get  these kids in line  Well yes  it's just  usually it's a  simple case 
[01:01:00]  of saying no  Right  some of these  parents  they don't know  how to parent  They don't know  how to say no  Were you actually  a nanny first  or how did you  kind of get  into this  Oh yeah  I was a nanny  for 14 years  and I worked  in a school  for 4 years  Really?  Yeah and I  actually got  my certificate  in the UK  a long time ago  Did you ever tell  kids they couldn't  have their pudding  until they finished  their meat?  No?  No  My mum used  to tell me that  Really?  Oh yeah  Your mum  I actually  had a nanny 
[01:01:30]  a British nanny  growing up  her name was  Louise Woodward  Oh stop it  Jesus  Come on  someone's got to be  impressed  I pulled that name  out of thin air  You certainly did  Yeah you did  didn't you?  How long have you  guys been on the air  of the show?  The show's been on  for two seasons  we've actually been  picked up for another  season  so we'll be filming  over the summer  Oh cool  And we'll be on  in September  Yeah  There is an element  of fun  We've got a sound  clip here  Ooh  Yeah sound clip  from  Mary Puzzle  Oh 
[01:02:00]  Do you go around  singing?  I've done this  in my time  You have huh?  I have  a lot of comparisons  to  I think that's why  they made all of  the nannies  from 9911  British  Yes because  we're practically  perfect in every way  Right  And I think 
[01:02:30]  it's a lot harder  to get angry with you  with that adorable  accent  Isn't that nice?  Yeah you guys look  a little too perfect  for me  Oh no  you can never  look too perfect  You guys got like  a dark side?  A dark side?  Yeah  I think everyone  has a dark side  don't you?  Yeah  Well what's your  dark side?  Oh I'm not  telling that  Because that would  make too good  for radio  Yeah that's right  Do you ever get mad  at the kids  you're working with?  I mean it's got to be  frustrating sometimes  It is frustrating sometimes 
[01:03:00]  and obviously  if I said no  then it would be  totally ridiculous  yes you can  but you take  you remove yourself  from the situation  or remove them  from the situation  Hey Nanny Yvonne  we got Kevin  on Long Island  he has a question  for you  because he's got  a few kids  Okay Kevin  Kevin?  Hey how you doing?  Hi Kevin  how are you?  Hi Nanny  What's your name  Nanny?  Yvonne  Yvonne  Hi nice to meet you  Listen I got a daughter  and she's a real pain  in the ass  This girl screams  she curses  she spits out a mother 
[01:03:30]  and every time  your show is on  I sit her in front  of the TV  I strap her to the couch  because she won't  sit down  and I make her watch it  and I threaten  that you guys  are going to come  to my house  It's like  is that the right  thing to do?  Yeah actually  I think really  what you should do  is look in the mirror  Look in the mirror?  Yeah  because I think  that's probably  where our problems  are coming from  Oh  I was raised right  I don't want to hear that  Well what are you  doing wrong then Kevin?  I'm not doing  anything wrong  it's my daughter 
[01:04:00]  she's a bitch  Oh come on now  come on now  you're the parent  How old is she Kevin?  She's seven  She's a seven year old bitch  And you can't control  your seven year old Kevin  Oh my god no  I think we should have  a school for  unruly parents  I think Kevin  should smack his kid  Oh no I do  every once in a while  I keep in mind  That's good Kevin  Do you condone  a little physical  Absolutely not  with the children  No?  Hey hey  my father gave me 
[01:04:30]  a couple of whacks  when I was a kid  I turned out fine  Yeah well we all  got spanked  growing up there  Yvonne  Well my mother  never had to do that  My mother had to  just give me the evil eye  and change the tone  of her voice  Thank you Kevin  But don't you think  a lot of these kids  would behave better  if you smacked him  around a little bit  We all got  and I'm not even kidding  we all got spankings  I got the wooden spoon  every so often  whack right on my ass  and I didn't do  whatever I was doing again  Do you know you can be  arrested for that  sort of thing?  Now you can  Nowadays  I don't know  and it seems like 
[01:05:00]  they're getting more  snotty children  these days  What's wrong with  teaching them  from an early age  manners and respect  I mean that  just seems to be  sad to you  Who has the time?  A good smack  takes care of it  sometimes  I got work to do  I got smacked  and thrown in my room  and then my parents  went about their lives  A lot of times  if I ever misbehaved  I got spanked  it would just teach me  that if I misbehave  my skirt's going to  get hiked up  and I'm going to  put on some thigh highs  and get a good paddling  Your skirt?  Yeah  Jimmy would wear  some skirts  And what do you think?  Do you think 
[01:05:30]  you turned out okay?  Yeah I'm fine  I'm pretty  I'm alright  It's kind of weird  but the phones  have exploded  A lot of people  out there have kids  You want to give  some advice  real fast  Yeah sure  Alright  Serious questions  only for Nanny Yvonne  Let's go to Mike  on Long Island  Hey Mike  What's up?  Hey guys  How's it going?  What's up  Little Jimmy?  Hey buddy  Hi Mike  Nanny  I have a quick question  I have a little boy  and he plays  this game called  Monster Rain  Wait wait  Monster?  Hold on  Monster Rain?  Yeah Monster Rain  I don't know  where the hell  he came off  What is that?  What is it?  But what happens 
[01:06:00]  is he goes  under the porch  and he'll  Monster Rain  and all of a sudden  they're doing  some weird sexual thing  I don't know  Nanny  What would you do  in this situation?  Well it sounds like  he's really  sort of mimicking  his parent  I'm sure that  he's learnt that  from somewhere  and you know  if I was you  I would just  you know  I don't know  what to say  I don't know  guys  do you think  maybe it's possibly  learned it from  like television  or the radio  or something like that  Wait  alright so Mike  you got a young boy  is it?  Yeah 
[01:06:30]  he's about  four years old  named Jimmy  Little Jimmy  alright  little Jimmy  and what  clouds are coming in  or something  and he yells  Monster Rain  goes under the porch  with other little boys  I don't know  what the hell  and they're making  all sorts of weird noises  and heads are bobbing  up and down  Nanny Yvonne  how would you handle  some kind of  inappropriate sexual behavior  between kids  how do you approach  that situation?  That's a good question  Mike  thank you  Is it healthy  Mike  Mike  Nanny 9-1-1  we'll come and  sort it out  Is it healthy 
[01:07:00]  if you catch  because my niece  if we caught her  doing something  like touching herself  you just point at the area  and yell  dirty  dirty  bed  That sounds like  a good thing to do  Oh yeah  I can see why  yeah  I can see why  you're not on  Nanny 9-1-1  Dirty  Dirty  Shame  Oh my god  Now isn't it  that you tell them  they're going to go blind  or something  Hold the phone  Hold the phone  I've been watching  Nanny 9-1-1  I see the nannies 
[01:07:30]  show up at the door  Yes  And I gotta say  they're very good  at their jobs  but they are a little  what would be called  matronly  What do you want?  I am now looking  at Nanny Yvonne  I am looking at  your picture  on the website  You are very  very attractive  Very attractive  Are you sure  you've got the right  Yvonne?  Oh yes  It says  Nanny Yvonne  Are you blonde?  I am  Wow  And I know  it's not very polite 
[01:08:00]  to ask  but are you  in your 20s?  Oh  I think you must  have the wrong Yvonne  She said 14 years  she's been a nanny  she has to be  in her 30s  And four years  in a school  Well you're thin  blonde  shoulder length hair  Yeah there was  another Nanny Yvonne  which you may be  confusing me with  I better not be  Well I hope not  You're very  very good  But there was  another Nanny Yvonne  so you may be  confusing me with her  Well then I will  blame MJ from Philly  who sent me the link 
[01:08:30]  Alright let's go to  we have a few more  moments here with  Nanny Yvonne  from Nanny 911  It's going to be  a great episode tonight  What channel by the way  What channel there?  It's Fox  I don't know what  your local Fox is  Oh Fox  Okay Fox  That's channel 5  here in New York  Let's go to Rich  in New York City  Rich what's up?  What's going on?  Hey  Nanny  Hello Rich  My wife Andrea  and I  we have five children  and whenever they  act up  she always threatens  them with a bath  and seems to get  them a little nervous  and kind of 
[01:09:00]  straightens them up  but I was wondering  if there's like  anything that might  be going on  that I need to  worry about  Sorry I didn't hear  what she threatened  them with  a bath  A bath  Wow that doesn't  sound healthy  His wife Andrea  threatens them with a bath  the five kids  All five of them  Now don't you think  that's going to make  the kids afraid  of a bath?  No I think  it'll make them  cleaner  Really?  They get very nervous  I'm not sure  No no no  don't worry  I think it'll just  make them cleaner  Don't worry  Nothing to worry  about there  They'll equate a bath  with something bad  A bath 
[01:09:30]  with something bad  Like if she's  punishing them  with a bath  Oh I see  what you mean  Yeah perhaps  then they're going  to equate  something bad  with a bath  and maybe  have bad memories  of a bath  Oh the bath  Oh the bath  Yeah let's  have a shower then  and then you can  always give them  a bath  Ah Nanny Yvonne  doesn't think  there's anything  wrong with that  there Rich  Don't worry about it  Yeah just let  your wife Andrea  let her give  the kids a bath  All right let's  go to Scott  in Modesto  Scott  Hey Owen  How you guys  doing today  How's California  today Scott  Hey uh 
[01:10:00]  Nanny Yvonne  I got a question  for you  I'm married right  now  I am not  I do not have  any children  but I am about  to have a nice  little baby boy  I'm going to  name him Connor  but the problem  that I got  is that my wife  is an overbearing  and pardon the  lack of a better  term  an overbearing  cunt  I really don't  feel like I should  be able to  smack the kids  or anything else  like that  but just being  a new dad  what would you

[01:12:00]  Bye bye  Bye  Wow Fox doesn't  have a sense of humor  I just got a note  Fox people saying  you need to wrap up  Fox is going to  drop the line  Oh they didn't  Why?  We were getting  calls from Scott  in Modesto  And Andrea  Five kids  People in the  industry  the entertainment  industry  just don't get it  No  They're all just  uptight assholes  Fox is like losing  their minds  because we're having  fun with 
[01:12:30]  Nanny Yvonne  A we liked Yvonne  and B  Fox  Look  Fox is the greatest  at exploiting things  Come on  you gotta relax  a little bit  Just relax  Don't worry about it  It's probably some  publicist  That's all it is  And British women  love the C word  Yeah  Benny  I use it all the  time over there  Oh yeah  I forgot about that  Ben was running in  and saying  you gotta wrap up  you gotta wrap up  to get a little  uptight  blah blah blah  Uptight about what?  What?  People were listening  to the interview  instead of having  a boring interview  Wow that's really great  32 special need boys 
[01:13:00]  on the show tonight  Tell me more about that  Now that ought to be a lot of  variety  to tell you the truth  Yeah roll tape for tonight  She was unflappable  though you gotta respect that  The British are like that  They are  They'd be amazing  And most of them  are very dirty  and kinky sexually  They're submissive  A lot of the British women  are very bright  They're very strong  But man they got that side  I dated a British girl  She wanted to be bitten  When I actually started  going on your show  back at NAW  I was dating this British girl  And Opie and Antony  Antony  She was really funny 
[01:13:30]  and caustic  Really?  Really smart  Brutal  Brutal humor  I went to her on a date  We were eating dinner  And she yawned  I'm like  You're tired  She's like  No you're boring  It's the hardest a date  has ever made me laugh  She was just funny  She was just a hilarious person  And she liked to be bitten  She liked to be  Remember I used to say  the girl used to want me  to hold her head  under the steering wheel  I used to force feed her  and she wanted me  to hold her under the steering wheel  so she couldn't  not give me head  Wow  And bite her back  and bite her back  and smack her 
[01:14:00]  And man  if you were to talk to her  face to face  she was like a school teacher  Nice  Like the British girls  Yeah  Dirty girls  Yeah  That's pretty cool  Dirty girls  I do watch that show though  9911  I thought that was a lot of fun  It's a laugh  Some of these people  are so dysfunctional  And you know damn well  when that nanny leaves  at the end of it  it's not all done  You know  they through editing  make it look all nice and dandy  but you know  it's still the same assholes  that she came into  10 days prior  and the kids 
[01:14:30]  are so nasty  You watch it  like a 5 year old  just punching a 3 year old  in the face  and the nanny's like  we're going to have to deal  with this problem  and bam  the kids just punching  the other kid  the other one  with the fat wife  and the husband  he was saying  this isn't what I bought  We should get into that next  because we still have  the audio from that  Clips of that  Yeah  Marriage 911  Right  This isn't what I bought  Those are fatty  Why don't we do that  after the break  Sure  Because you saw this one  Yeah  Alright  Brutal 
[01:15:00]  Now the Fox people  have got to chill  the fuck out  That was a good interview  We were having fun with her  Now people know  that the show's on tonight  Let's all relax  Is that a clip of the show?  Did they show Nanny Yvonne?  Which one is she?  These are all the special needs  These are special needs kids  That isn't her is it?  No  No she's like the head nanny  That's her right there?  That could be her  That might be her  Alright she's alright  Oh my god  British  What's their name?  Silcock?  Yeah  British  Jim and Anne Silcock 
[01:15:30]  Silcock  I think British humor  is very overrated  but at times  the one thing I love  about the British  is they're like  if that guy would have  called up with an American  woman on the phone  and said that  but the British  are like ugh  There are times  where they're very  they still don't have  that PC nonsense  in their humor  which I like  they still can be  pretty brutal  in humor  and be very funny  without worrying  about offending  so that's one thing  about British humor  you're going to love  Yep  Alright we'll take a break  as we go to break  here's an example 
[01:16:00]  of British humor  from Family Guy  British porn  check this out  it's a quickie  Peter the toilet paper  is made of money  Yeah and look at this  they even got some  of that high class  British porn  almost  almost  almost  there we are  Well done  The very worst  of the Opie and Anthony  F.U. Life  You two sick bastards  I need you every morning  like I need a  fucking morning  with this 
[01:16:30]  Fuck you  I'm coming down there  today  kick  Master Paul  right in the fucking nuts  so you tell him  get ready  I'm coming  Hey I want to give  a big fuck you to Ben  you come goes one whore  buy some new t-shirts  Yeah how you doing  I'm out of the bar  with my friend  and my friend Benny  cold fucked me  in the lift  A big fuck you Benny  you hit like a  fucking bitch  Yeah you did  This is for the  fucking math lizard  tour from 
[01:17:00]  Jamaica Station  150 times 7  is 1200  you fucking puke  Get a calculator  bitch  Fuck it  Call the Opie and Anthony  F.U. Line  at 1-866-FU  Line 1  1-866-FU  Line 1  Oh fuck you very much  Healing roses  disappearing  into mold  as the dry mouth  breaking into  birds 
[01:17:30]  I'm stealing  our intentions  and the  sitting  with the  oil  crying  and the  toe  of  solution  still you  feed a  slice  from the  pit of  blood  blood  clallelalalalalalalala  Everybody's going to the party  Have a real good fact  Dancing in the desert 
[01:18:00]  blowing up the sunshine  System of a down  System of a down  Is that the song they  played on SNL?  Yeah  B-Y-O-B  right?  Oh this is the one they cursed on  right?  Pretty good stuff  Everyone is up in arms  because the F word  made it on SNL again  Who cares about the F word 
[01:18:30]  at this point?  What's going to happen  12 o'clock  on Saturday night?  Artists are just doing it now  to be edgy  because you know you can't curse  on TV  Guarantee they're not cursing  in the rehearsals  I watched Metallica rehearse there  when Brewer got them on  years ago  They go  30 times they play the song  to make sure it's timed out right  Everything they go over  So there's no shock  They're just doing it  now to get their name out there  Well it's getting some ink today  as they say  Some ink  Some press  System of a down  I guess it was the guitarist 
[01:19:00]  right?  At the end of that song  when they were performing it live  he said fuck yeah  Who cares?  Even five year olds  are saying the F word  It's just a word  But no one's going to say  no one's going to say  anything about it  at midnight  Just in case you missed it  here it is from Saturday  And like the camera 
[01:19:30]  was right on him too  when they did that  Yeah  When he did it  So you could see him  yell that out  It's really another  who cares story  Put on a five second delay  That's all you've got to do  But  What's the problem with that?  Like where is any problem  with him yelling that  fuck yeah  during that song  on TV  What is it going to do  that is so bad  that laws need be made 
[01:20:00]  to keep anybody  from doing that?  I don't get it  I wonder if  the industry's going to  ban him or Vince Neil  for dropping the F-bomb  on live shows  like they did for Dice  when he cursed  on MTV's Music Awards  I wonder if there's  going to be the same  backlash against musicians  Absolutely not  Once again  another example  I know I keep  bringing up Dice  he's just the point  of comparison  with comics  who have caught  shit for language  Let's just see  if there's any type  of backlash  against any musicians  like there was  against him  It won't be 
[01:20:30]  Of course it won't be  Of course  Another case of  double standards  in the industry  Alright here we go  It's a big story  though  It's on page 3  of the Daily News here  F-bomb maybe  blow to SNL  Oh  Saturday Night Live  has added another  live follow up  to its long history  of unscripted flubs  just as the  toughening standards  of broadcast decency  raised the specter  of more federal fines  The guitarist for  System of a Down  screamed  fuck yeah  as the camera  zoomed in on him  near the end  of their musical performance  Saturday night  It wasn't the first  SNL snafu 
[01:21:00]  involving the F-word  Three actors  have let it slip  during sketches  in the show's  three decade history  and singers have  occasionally unleashed  the expletive  during late night  musical numbers  But coming after  Janet Jackson's  Super Bowl  breast-bearing incident  Last year  in an FCC  crackdown  on indecent TV  the incident  has raised  the possibility  of trouble  for NBC  Anthony  Trouble  SNL is not  commenting obviously  and quite frankly 
[01:21:30]  no one really cares  The papers are  making a big deal  out of this  You know that  when Norm MacDonald  said the F-word  back in 1997  NBC said it received  two complaints  and three calls  of support  Two complaints  and three calls  of support  Right  That's it  People just don't  care about the F-word  anymore  They just don't  People go  wow did you hear that  Yeah  But they have to make  a big deal  out of it  down there  in Washington  Anyone that would  complain  isn't watching  the show  first of all 
[01:22:00]  The only people  that would  complain now  are these  watchdog groups  that would have  found out  second hand  that it happened  They wouldn't have  been watching it  either  and then they  send all their  cult members  these forms  to fill out  to send to the FCC  They received  thousands of  complaints  Not one of them  from anyone  who actually  saw the show  It's from the  Parents Television  Council  and they  send out these  things to their  followers  followers 
[01:22:30]  their flock  of sheep  and they  fill it out  as if they  watched it  and complain  and demand  something be done  and the FCC  goes  We received  thousands of  complaints  They're all  bogus  fake complaints  All from the  Parents Television  Council  Yeah  All of them  from one  organization  that is just  terrorizing the  nation with  their bullshit  Enough  Mitch from  New Jersey  They should  fine SNL  for just doing  a shitty show  Yeah  SNL's in one  of their  transitional 
[01:23:00]  phases  I think  Yeah  They started  this one  I think  in 88  How about  just having  a five second  delay  and getting  over it  That's all  you do  You have  a guy  and a dump  button  That's it  Problem solved  No blow  to SNL  How about  we just  realize  in the year  2005  that fuck  is part  of the  English  language  now  Who cares  Everybody  uses it  in everyday  speech  It's a great  word  to just  pepper things  about  SNL was  funny  a few years  back  Will Ferrell  on there  Yeah  What's her  name  Sherry Oteri 
[01:23:30]  during that  whole phase  That was  pretty good  Definitely  And then  it's kind  of slowly  been going  down  They've had  some funny  stuff  But now  I mean  Daryl  I think  is funny  Daryl's  very funny  Yeah  That's about  it though  You know  I hate to  say that  So there  you go  Not to say  there aren't  talented people  on there  They just  don't know  how to  use them  I think  a lot  of it  is that  the edge  that they  had  years ago  like Pryor  and Chevy  Chase doing  that sketch  with racial  epithets  says nigger  and Pryor  says dead 
[01:24:00]  honky  I mean  I heard  that they  kind of  winged that  and it was  just such  a great  moment  and a funny  moment  and you'd  never have  anything like  that  because again  watch the  groups  would be  up in arms  and SNL  would never  let it go  through  Yeah  everything's  a little  too PC  now  They want  to make  it seem  like they're  whoa  look how  out on the  edge  we are  but nah  they don't  want to  offend  anybody  except  they do  a good  job goofing  on their  own  the Hollywood  people  they do  that pretty  well  but as  far as  issues  or anything  like that  they stay 
[01:24:30]  steer clear  of it  and a note  to these  bands  they're not  getting outrageous  anymore  by saying  the F word  yeah  it's like  stop  yeah  you know  if you really  want to  mix things  up  go for the  C word  on live  TV  there you  go  we did  it  now that's  the word  guys  we did  it  we got  the F bomb  on live  TV  with the  N word  point at  someone in  the audience  and yell  it  there you  go  now you're  being edgy  shit up  yeah  now you're  doing it  oh you sure  are  but if a show  puts you on  like especially  as a band 
[01:25:00]  how about  point to a  black woman  in the crowd  and call her  an NC  absolutely  yeah  now you're  talking  amen  wow  FNC  why not  that would  be huge  but if they  put you on TV  you don't need  to yell that  just do what  you're doing  stop again  stop going  to be outrageous  exactly what it is  it sounds like  they just got  caught up in the  moment  you know  it didn't seem  like he was  really you know  trying for the  the headline  but he got it  today and there  you go  that's what it's  all about  they got some  nice exposure 
[01:25:30]  today  system of a  down  all right  we did the  nanny thing  you want to do  marriage 9-1-1  or you want to  listen to these  two Pat O'Brien  remixes that came  in over the  weekend  this bit's just  about over  yeah  yeah  let's hear some  Pat O'Brien  stuff  all right  I really don't  know with this  aunt's daughter  Lynn if this  one's a good  one or not  the second one  is really funny  you don't remember  Lynn  no I remember it  but I don't  remember any details  from it  I don't remember  what she said  or anything  so you know  it's kind of like  it's kind of odd  because everything else  you kind of know 
[01:26:00]  what lines are being  said and what  context they were  meant in in the  first place  and how silly it  is now to be  that person be  reacting to Pat  O'Brien  but this one  I don't even  remember  all right  I gotta back up  slightly though  we gotta go to  North Carolina  Carolina  Carolina  Tyler what's up  hey man  big fan here  in North Carolina  just wanted to ask  Professor Anthony  if you knew  where the roots  of the word  fuck came from  you know  a lot of stories  a lot of urban  legend behind  where the word  fuck came from  a lot of people  think it's 
[01:26:30]  for unlawful  carnal knowledge  but this has been  proven to be  a fallacy  Opie  the truth of the  matter is  there really isn't  any definitive  answer as to  where the word  fuck came from  a lot of theories  a lot of things  people will tell you  are absolutely  the truth  but truth of the  matter is  there's no  real origin  of the word  fuck  forget Aristotle  and fuck  Socrates  here comes  Professor Anthony 
[01:27:00]  the worst  the worst  explanation I ever  heard was someone  told me that it  was like from  medieval times  and they put it  on your door  and it stood for  fornicating under  the consent of the  king  shut up  no it doesn't  and that's like  the golf one  gentlemen only  ladies forbidden  shut up  not true  maybe fuck  means  is from the  german word  freaking  to strike  I got that  we're gonna play  that  hey guys  I wanted to ask  you I was away  on vacation  what happened  to Mitch  Hedberg  he died 
[01:27:30]  they think it  was drugs  or it was hard  or something  no one really  came out  with a real  answer  yeah  that's like  the word  fuck  I saw  one of his  last appearances  at Caroline's  very funny guy  and then went  backstage  met him for the  first time  and he gave me  a big hug  and a kiss  which was a little  weird  he was out of  his mind  that night  backstage  and then  he wanted to do  our radio show  really bad  we exchanged  numbers and stuff  and then  we went on  vacation  and I get a  text message  from Ben  and I couldn't 
[01:28:00]  believe it  yeah I heard  he got gangrene  in his leg  from shooting  eggs or something  no there was  more urban myth  no no no  I don't know  who was gangrene  or not  I heard the same  thing this guy  saying that he  was busted  in an airport  for having  heroin needles  which apparently  at the time  saved his leg  they said  because it was  either gangrene  or getting there  I don't know  if it was true  or not though  because I never  saw Mitch  after that  he spent some  time in a hospital  and again  this is just  what I've been told  and people didn't  know if he cleaned  up or not  but I guess he didn't  I mean he wound  up just probably  going right back  to it  getting gangrene 
[01:28:30]  in the leg  is a shot  across the bow  if that doesn't  tell you  look  maybe you ought  to knock this off  maybe you should  just get an ounce  of pot  a case of beer  or something  it's all the same  stuff man  if you do one  you're going to  probably do them  all if you're  that far  I guess his mom  said he always  had a heart  problem  oh it's possible  too  well I just  wanted to say  I love you guys  I get everyone  I know to buy  the XM radios  I used to listen  to you in Jersey  and I'm checking out  thanks yeah  the virus is spreading  slowly but surely  every week  so thank you for that  let's go to  Aaron in New York 
[01:29:00]  Aaron  yeah what's going on  guys  what's up  listen we all know  Howard Stern invented  the word fuck  he invented everything  no one said that  before me  punch it out  wait till you hear  our second  Pat O'Brien remix  today  Scott on Long Island  what's up  tell him Fred  I said fuck first  all my in-laws  are German  and I can definitely  tell you that  fuck comes from  the word flicken  in German  because that word  is just ingrained  in every sentence  these people say  yeah and how does  fuck come out  of that my friend  well flicken 
[01:29:30]  is the German word  for you said  to strike  or to do  or things like that  and how did that  turn into fuck  your guess is  as good as mine  how does any word  become a word  but I can tell you  they think they  invented it  and I tend to  agree with them  alright thank you sir  it probably does  sound like some  foreign word  or something like that  probably  let's take a quick  listen to this  perhaps one of the 
[01:30:00]  most interesting  words in the  English language  today is the  word fuck  out of all of  the English words  that begin with  the letter F  fuck is the only  word that is  referred to as  the F word  it's the one  magical word  just by its  sound can describe  pain  pleasure  hate  and love  fuck  as most words  in the English  language is derived  from German  the word  which means  to strike  in English 
[01:30:30]  fuck falls  into many  grammatical categories  as a transitive  verb  for instance  John fucked  surely  as an intransitive  verb  surely fucks  its meaning  is not always  sexual  it can be used  as an adjective  such as  John's doing  all the fucking  work  as part of  an adverb  surely talks  too fucking  much  as an adverb  enhancing an  adjective  surely is  fucking beautiful  as a noun 
[01:31:00]  I don't give  a fuck  as part of a  word  abso-fucking-lutely  or  in-fucking-credible  and  as almost  every word  in a sentence  fuck the  fucking fuckers  as you must  realize  there aren't  too many words  with the versatility  of fuck  as in these  examples  describing situations  such as  fraud  I got fucked  at the used  car lot  dismay  aww fuck it  trouble  I guess  I'm really 
[01:31:30]  fucked now  aggression  don't fuck  with me buddy  difficulty  I don't understand  this fucking  question  inquiry  who the fuck  was that  dissatisfaction  I don't like  what the fuck  is going on  here  incompetence  he's a fuck  off  dismissal  why don't  you go outside  and play hide  and go fuck  yourself  I'm sure you  can think of  many more  examples  with all of  these multi-purpose 
[01:32:00]  applications  how can anyone  be offended  when you use  the word  we say  use this  unique  flexible  word  more often  than your  daily speech  it will  identify the  quality of  your character  immediately  say it loudly  and proudly  fuck you  ah and there  you have it  a classic  we haven't played  that in a while  wonderful  fuck is a very  old word  recorded in  English  since the  15th century  and some 
[01:32:30]  of the  some of the  words that it  is thought  to come from  Dutch  fucken  meaning to  thrust  or copulate  with  Norwegian  dialect  fuke  to copulate  and the  swish  swish  swedish  dialect  foke  to strike  push  copulate  I say one  of those  three  that's the  risk I'll  take  it means  that the  term's  origin  is likely  germanic  even though 
[01:33:00]  no one  can as  yet point  to the  precise  word  it came  down  to us  from  out of  all the  possible  candidates  so  yeah  no one  actually  knows  there's a  few  likelihoods  but  any  of the  acronyms  that people  come up  with  are bullshit  fornication  under  consent  of the  king  forbidden  under  charter  of the  king  oh  shut  your  faces  knowledge  you  boobs  fornication 
[01:33:30]  under  christ  the  king  who  got laid  under  the  cross  that's  awful  was  that  mary  magdalene  was  getting  railed  while  he  was  crucified  you  morons  yeah  none  of those  are  true  all right  we got  another  little  something  to play  here  uh let me get a nickel bag 
[01:34:00]  fifteen  fifteen bucks  little man  put that shit  in my hand  if that money  doesn't show  then you owe me  owe me  oh  my jungle  oh  yeah  oh  we owe  we owe  i think i wanna  know you  know ya  yeah  what  thank you  thank you eric  there you go 
[01:34:30]  all right  i like that kind of language  you want to do the pat o'brien uh... remixes we got two more to play and then we might put this one to bed unless something comes in overnight all right we've had a lot of fun with the pat o'brien sex tapes anthony  of course we have now this guy came up with one uh... featuring ants daughter lynn  yeah it doesn't have a daughter lynn but this uh... this woman that calls every once in a while from massachusetts her name's lynn obviously  she really believes that anthony is her father it is the creepiest thing we haven't heard from her in a couple of years ever since we got fired i guess uh... haven't heard her heard from her on the new show here on xm so i don't know what she's been up to but she's a real kook 
[01:35:00]  i remember she called in once i think did she ever call any w or bcm when i was with you guys any w they don't ever hearing her we would do  well i don't know thirty forty five minute conversations with the girl  yeah i'm completely out of her mind or so and she would start crying and stuff and remember  she would start crying it was the weird awful daughter she is and is she hot  uh...  get a picture of her man maybe little jimmy could uh... work it and say i'll talk to daddy for you my son-in-law 
[01:35:30]  she's uh... she's the real deal though you don't want to mess with uh... you don't want to mess with this one there's something going on there  so we haven't really heard this yet but it's basically aunt's daughter lynn and pat o'brien getting together for this remix let's take a listen we might have to stop it if it's uh... stinks not happening  because uh... someone gave us a pat for minaki one it just blows  oh that was pretty good i like the fact that some of these pat o'brien ones do eight minutes of pat o'brien and then one clip of someone going okay  yeah i don't even think it's worth playing so bad right i want to jerk off in your face 
[01:36:00]  oh to say that to me  what yeah exactly it doesn't make sense some of the clips  you know what sucks  in my car  i know how this radio thing works  now we have to play it  because now we brought it to everyone's attention  if we didn't bring it to their attention they wouldn't know how bad this is  but now that we're telling people it's bad we have to play it  here's a bad example  i want to eat your pussy and i want to fuck you  oh no you're at the door  yeah that ties in vaguely stupid  it doesn't make sense  all right we'll have to listen to this 
[01:36:30]  give a listen op  but here's the setup we acknowledge that this one isn't that good  stinks  hawk push it in  it's so bad that it wouldn't even queue up in the cd player  who uh... who made this  oh uh... nanny yvonne is going to be on z100 in five minutes  oh we should tune in  i'm sure that'll be a similar interview  of course  let's see how wacky their interview is  we ought to tune in  well we do the wacky radio bit from time to time  and we could do that uh... this morning with z100 here in new york city  yes certainly could because i'm sure they're gonna just get just as outrageous as we did  now the uh... daddy you go to the house 
[01:37:00]  shut up  where were you when i was growing up and needed someone  zoo crew laughter  they're all laughing and cackling  and the stupid token broad is trying to keep everyone in line  oh now let me ask a question  you keep turning off your mic aunt  i do  i think  maybe i do  oh ok  yeah  do i sound ok on mic  unfortunately you do  that's on  there we go  fuck face  i'm there now  here we go  uh... so yeah this is pat o'brien and uh... pat from monarchy 
[01:37:30]  this is just awful  yes  do i know you  uh...  you're so fucking hot  uh...  i wanna fucking  suck your pussy  watch you and betsy eat each other  suck my cock  i suck more than a black hole  read over your face  oh wonderful  yeah you're so fucking hot  uh... 
[01:38:00]  i fucking want  to just  fucking make you crazy  that'll do it  and betsy that you have to hurt  i'm gonna watch you guys make out  i got bigger press than her  i just fucking have sex and fun and drugs  fuck with me  you wanna get under me?  haha  i feel a little gay right now  oh  but that was a really good editing job  what'd you have two fucking cassette recorders across from each other? 
[01:38:30]  awful  alright  you know  we could do 10-15 minutes on how bad that is  but uh... the nanny is on z100 right now  so let's listen in  and  there's a wacky radio uh... bit going  going down  it takes you a long way when you're an adult as well  and you learn it when you're a child  um... that and structure  um... you can see from watching the shows  there's a lack of it  but nanny  these kids are  monsters on some of these shows  they spit  and they they cut  they throw things at people 
[01:39:00]  and then you  and the mothers and dads look like they wanna jump off a cliff sometimes  i feel so sorry for them  i was telling the guys here in the room earlier that  no offense to those who love kids or having them  watching nanny mary is the best form of birth control that i've ever seen in my life  it really is  it really is  no offense guys he's kidding  i think that's hysterical  and i think you know as you  no you don't  no offense to anyone who has kids  yeah cats are pretty tricky too 
[01:39:30]  um... but uh... everyone that doesn't have children always say  you know oh i i wouldn't do that or you know i i would do that differently and my children will never be like that  but until you get them you really don't know what you're going to encounter  nanny nanny ivan do you do you have children  i don't actually  so i wonder if your kids would be like out of control brats  take care of other people's kids i guess is my thought  well what i can tell you is that i you know i've been with families for many many years 
[01:40:00]  one family i was with i was with for six years so i basically um and i had the children from day one  um so i basically brought the children up while the parents um you know were working  right so i think as long as you start the children off um as they as you mean to go on and you start at an early age  then wonders can happen miracles can happen  you know one of the things that parents discuss all the time is the argument is whether you're supposed to be your kid's friend or you're supposed to be their parents 
[01:40:30]  yeah absolutely  and a lot of people today want to be their kid's friends rather than their parents  okay  uh... you know you you need to be a parent and you need to be the one that's teaching them  and that's how the respect comes in  you know if you've got a child swearing at you  and as you've seen in the show  there is absolutely no respect there  that's what i was going to say nanny there's a prevalence there  with the authority figure  i'm really a lot of the times it seems like the kids are running  you should never use the word prevalence on a radio show 
[01:41:00]  exactly stupid  you know i wasn't brought in that way  that's why i didn't say no  that's funny  most people don't bring their children up their way  that way but once you do  someone's got to come in with a joke  they've gone too long without laughing  here in the room is uh... our friend danielle  who is how many months pregnant are you danielle  six  she is six months pregnant  kick her in the stomach  and then yvonne she doesn't look nervous but you know  as a parent is expecting their first child  oh god here we go  advice for the new mom to be  what is your number one piece of advice from day one with that child 
[01:41:30]  get a belt  it's basically manners and respect  don't trip on your stomach before the kid pops out  i do  i do  because  because i  you know  stay away from rowboats  friggin  little fishing trip  christmas eve  hold off on the martial arts classes  if you start with manners and respect  and they respect you  they respect what you  then you'll get communication  car seat minivan  boat ramp  that's what you're saying  and  you know  it just is the basics  and if you start off like that  you know  i've had babies  in 
[01:42:00]  you know  high chairs  you know learning the basic please and thank you  i mean you can do it  nanny  what kind of disciplinary tactics do you have  because my mom used to beat me over the head with a chancleta  and i don't think that that is really a  what's that a chair  no she would hit me over the head with one of her high heels  a high heel  what would you suggest to people who aren't you know  who are  you know  what should we be beating our children with  what should we be beating our children with  yes exactly  no i find that cause and effect  i mean if you know again communication  you know there have been situations where 
[01:42:30]  you know  are we done with this  no it's just great  i'm learning something opie  i want to hear more wackiness  at that moment  can i ask nanny a question  and remove the child  we're listening would be really good if we could ask questions  we've got to figure out somehow to get into the other people's shows  nanny  nanny  how do i get the kids to lick milk off my dick  trust and respect  just point at it and say go on lick it  it's alright  what a toy  what a contrast with what goes on in radio man 
[01:43:00]  we went right for the juggler  and they're doing a real interview  and that's the chick they tossed christina nagging for  and this is what's a miami zelch  here you go i'm gonna beat you with a shoe  nanny 9-1-1  we'll be watching  looks like you guys have your hands full tonight  that's gonna be a great show  yeah cause they're all retarded  full of retards  thank you  now their little wrap up  well you know what  with their job  they just go  most parents have their own kids  that they have to struggle with raising 
[01:43:30]  these people  these nannies go from one bad situation  to another  every day in their lives  is crisis time  i know they're gonna have a show coming up  where it's like a check-in show  to see all the families they help  and see how they're doing now  that would be good  can you stop trying to have personality stupid  you know what  after every sleeve report  we give away zutopia tickets  we're just now  alright  thank you for that wacky radio alert  touch tones  beep boop boop boop boop  beep boop boop  beep boop boop  beep boop boop boop  beep boop boop boop  no offense to anyone who has kids 
[01:44:00]  who's about to have kids  you middle of the road motherfucker  that is  that said it all right there  what do you think's gonna happen  you're gonna tease kids  in paris can go look  i don't like we make fun of kids  i have them  yeah  hey we're losing advertisers  that's what  exactly what he's thinking  can you have one ounce of balls  no offense to anybody  doing anything  ever  no offense to anyone who has kids  or doesn't have kids  but kids drive to the pedophiles out there  should we follow the nanny  across america today  because i guess she's gonna be calling  uh...  uh...  the morning buzz  in new hampshire

[01:45:00]  a female  on the radio  i just cringe  i just curl up  in a little ball  they add nothing  to those shows  here's what they should  be saying on the show  all right let me spit  my gum out before i put  that in my mouth  atta girl  and then get the coffee  oh she would hit me  in the head with a  chongrita  what the hell was that  just put her in a  dunking tank  and give her some news  to read  that's what women  should be doing  on the radio  that's it  stay out of the room

[01:53:00]  to go  up in there  one foot on the seat  one on the floor  bent forward  like we were  discussing last week  as long as the  door is closed  you don't need to  know what's behind  that door  he's got a whole  stance and everything  one foot  wait a minute  it's like a  heisman trophy  on the toilet  you get up off  the toilet  i stand  you stand up  now you  hold on  you can't stand  that messes  everything back there  it mushes him  back together  no can i stand 
[01:53:30]  it's kind of like  hold on hold on  i got a quick thing  it reminds me of  you know  painting as a kid  and you have  paint on one side  and then they make  you fold the  paint splot  yeah and then you  open it up  it's like  ah wow  now that paint's  over there  you're doing a  Rorschach test  between your butt cheeks  how did you know  that was called  a Rorschach test  you don't know that  no one knows that  Rorschach didn't know  they named it after him  until he just heard  you say it  what i do is  i stand up  now do you face  the toilet  you turn and face it  and put one foot up 
[01:54:00]  on it  that really depends  on what the way  you kind of have  to kind of face  the bathroom  yeah yeah okay  i mean i don't get  backed by the septic tank  like i'm Washington  on the front of the boat  sit one foot up  and look forward  throw a nickel  across the bathroom  he has a toilet stool  we've discussed that  we've heard about  his toilet stools  in order to  get a good dump  jimmy has a little  footstool  that he puts  his feet up on  to help the clean up  right  no no no no  while his feet are 
[01:54:30]  elevated  it's easier for him  to dump  it's better for your  intestines  it's a healthier  position to be in  and i actually  it takes your feet  off the floor  about six to eight  inches  yeah  it just makes  your insides  bed up a bit  so he's sitting there  like he's in a  mercury capsule  sometimes i'll put  my hand on my chin  and the other on my  knee and i look  like the thinker  but i put  i get off the  ball  i put my left  foot on the floor  my right foot  on the seat  oh my god  i lean forward  lean forward

[02:03:30]  your mom's trying  to lose weight  these must be  these must be  a no fat chocolate bar  she's eating  like so sarcastic  and very nasty to her  and one thing he said was  that he's mad at her  for being so fat  because that's not  what he married  and that's not  what he bought  he said  this isn't what I bought  so he's pissed  good for him  they always show  the fat lazy husband  nice to see that  good  and he comes home  and he bore this  weird resemblance  almost to  who the hell was it  from lethal weapon  was he black or white 
[02:04:00]  white  Mel Gibson  Mel Gibson  but it was like  Mel Gibson's  retarded older brother  kind of looking  but you could see  how someone would  trying to strike up  a conversation with him  might say  you kind of look  like Mel Gibson  so he comes home  and he's always  telling his wife  how many girls  at the office  told him he looked  like Mel Gibson today  so he's just  twisting it to her  and she's twisting  it to him  an interesting twist  in lethal weapon  the woman  the picture of his wife  that died 
[02:04:30]  that was Dice's  first wife  really  yes  bit of trivia  Dice's first wife  is a picture  of the dead  that caused him  so much pain  yes  how about that  is the guy  keeping himself together  yeah for the most part  sure  you know  regular guy  working Joe  kind of guy  back to the office  but he doesn't help out  with the kids  and she's pissed at that  I've been working  on a new bit  yeah  and I'm trying to figure out  how to get it done  without getting punched  in the face  but I want to walk  around the streets  in New York  you know how they 
[02:05:00]  have the outdoor cafes  yeah  and I'm dead serious  I'm just trying  to figure this out  maybe do it  with club soda candy  it would be a great bit  for meet the creeps  by the way  and when you see  a fat lady  just eating something  really disgusting  on the sidewalk  for lunch  you know  it's called  no wonder you're fat  you don't even have  to describe it anymore  wait a minute now  wow  can you imagine  the reaction  how do they  how do they  like  how do they respond  to that  you're walking 
[02:05:30]  down as just  you know  a Joe worker  we see it every day  I see it all the time  because I'm so sick  of these people  saying they can't help it  it's something  that genetic  bullshit  but you see these  fatties  eating  just this awful  stuff  for lunch  and stuff  and I just  want to play  a game  called  you know  actually the game  would be called  and you wonder  why you're fat  yes  and  I'm not even kidding  I'm going to get  a dat recorder  I'm going to try 
[02:06:00]  a few  you would just  stop  yeah  point at their food  point at their food  and say that  and wait for the reaction  and just say  and you wonder  why you're fat  and you wonder  why you're fat  no offense to people  who might be overweight  or having trouble eating  how funny  not that listeners  should do that  and send in clips  because that would be  really offensive  to have a bunch of  fat people being assaulted  of course  all over New York  that's hilarious  that is really good  everyone has seen it  the old bad person  just stuffing their face  you know what  give me  I haven't done street stuff  in a long time  give me a freaking  dat recorder  I'll try a couple  what the hell  chase you 
[02:06:30]  of course you could just  oh people in the restaurant  will be appalled  oh  oh  oh my god  that is rude  no wonder you're fat  I'm not  I'm not going to go  into restaurants  it's all these outdoor cafes  they're right on the sidewalk  and you walk by  you can get a quick one in  where they can jump over  the railing  and then chase you  and you wonder  why you're fat  just yell that at them  point  walk away  alright anyway  so here's the first clip  from Marriage 911  what attracted me to Laura 
[02:07:00]  was she was very tall  very leggy  just beautiful  the moment Laura  became pregnant  everything changed  as far as her eating habits  she just started eating  everything and anything  she wanted  a lot of candy  a lot of cookies  a lot of snacks  get your priorities straight  you know  she porked out  I was freaked out  in fact what I told Laura 
[02:07:30]  was this isn't what I bought  this isn't the person  that I made a decision  to spend my life with  you know  get away fat ass  get away fat ass  I love this guy  he just  he's saying  he calls it  like he sees it  that's it  she gained hundreds of pounds  and he's pissed  you know  when you get married  never been married  but when the  sorry  I am so distracted  there's a new commercial out  it's  I guess  is it Old Navy  the bikini commercial  the bathing suits  for the family commercial  best commercial 
[02:08:00]  on television right now  there's just  hot chicks in bikinis  holy crap  like laying on blankets  and they all look like 18  could that black guy  be darker  yeah  looks like a Haitian  who lives on Venus  that's the darkest  black man I've ever seen  that's the Jamaican  that's going to be  stealing your girl  in those bikinis  his name is Token  why do they have to do that  we get it  black people  wear bathing suits too  there's got to be the black person  and the Asian  in every commercial  we get it  they can't just be white people 
[02:08:30]  want to represent everybody  everyone must be represented  there are exclusive  black McDonald's commercials  but in every other commercial  you see they've got to put a mix  but there are like  no it's great  boom  boom  boom  boom  yeah  Mickey D's  you know it's just going to be a black  those are the hiring in-house videos  anyone else notice that  when they try to represent  everybody out there  in some of these commercials  they find those models that  wait  Asian  black  yeah  the Asian black  white person  they take care of three or four 
[02:09:00]  with one model  yeah  yeah  because they can't get all these people  on the screen at the same time  I don't want to do that  a Blatino  we got Nuts from  whackbag.com  hey  proud to be fat  hello  hey what's up man  how you guys doing today  how you doing  little sweet teeks  I'm okay Nuts  I hope you're well too  I'm doing wonderful  good good  hey I am proud to be fat man  not every fat person  says that it's from the glands 
[02:09:30]  or it's from  you know  genetics and all that bullshit man  I'm proud to be over 500 pounds  can I disagree with you  and say that  is it pride  or is it just a defense mechanism  like I'm not going to let  the true pain of this episode  get me down  almost like a defiance  out of sadness  yeah you're probably right Jimmy  I don't think  you should use the word pride  no one wants to be fat  you don't want to be fat  you might be okay  with your fatness  and that's fine  but to say I'm  proud to be fat  is a little weird 
[02:10:00]  I don't think anyone's proud  to be in  I don't think people are proud  to be in good shape  it's just  what you choose to do  well you should be  if you've ever seen  Ope when he stretches  that little sweater  comes up  onto the belly button  and you see those V lines  how can you not be proud  of that  for Pete's sake  Jesus  sometimes you want to  run your fingers over it  and go look at the  muscular outline there  no no no  you've seen him  you've put his hands over  how are you not proud  of that  oh yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah 
[02:10:30]  yeah  I'm kidding of course  I mean no offense  to gay people  anybody who might have  some gay friends  or you know  I'm just saying that  in good nature  wait till we get to  today's gay story  the gay story of the day  we might have to start  a new segment on the show  called gay news  because gay news  man there's some  there's some gay sex  going on all over  New York City  some gay stuff  going on in this city  boy  let me tell ya  we'll get into that  in a little bit  alright so marriage 911  we like this guy right  yeah it's great 
[02:11:00]  okay here's an  I can't stand the fact  that his wife  turned into a pig  yeah when you get married  and the guy who marries you  a priest or whatever  he does for better or worse  I think you're not  looking at your woman  thinking yeah  if the worst means  she's going to gain  100 pounds  I'll be there for ya  yeah  you're not thinking that  when they say that  that famous phrase  you know what  everyone wants  you're thinking that  if she gets a little cold  you'll help her out  a little bit  yeah  maybe her logs  become too long  and solid  that's okay  sorry 
[02:11:30]  again that horrified look  alright that's true  maybe you should marry her  and then put her in a room  and fuck her in the mouth  hey and what the hell  is wrong with you today  I expected from Jimmy  not you  I pictured a wacky  morning show  just you know  gathering around  showing her a thing or two  she's double pumping  from left to right  both hands working  of course  alright well 
[02:12:00]  let's play another clip from  oh that's right  you know  a guy gets married  and the woman  or even the guy  gets fat  sure  you love the person  inside  and it shouldn't matter  what the hell happens  if they gain a bunch  of weight  and stuff  but the fact of the matter  is  that's part of it  you don't want to be  married  to someone that's fat  you don't want a big fatty  if you married a fatty  that's one thing  you can't then say  hey lose some weight  fat ass  but if you marry  a nice slender  girl 
[02:12:30]  and she porks up  like that  you should not  catch shit  for saying  hey  what's going on  over here  I think you want  someone that  is willing to  at least try  take a whack at it  take a whack at it  and try to stay in shape  take a whack  and try to stay in shape  after you have a kid  but there's so many  couples out there  there's one or the other  just giving up  just giving up  they don't even try anymore  you know  you hear these excuses  I was listening to  1010 Wins  and they were doing  a whole little piece  on Hollywood moms 
[02:13:00]  and how they snap back  into shape  and look beautiful  and they were talking  to regular moms  around the city  and the big excuse  was well  if I could afford  a personal trainer  to come in on a daily basis  and work out  I could snap back too  there's a gray area there  you don't need to be rich  and have a personal trainer  and if you can't afford that  it means going  and stuffing your face  every day  with fat  and Twinkies  that seems to be  what they do  well I can't afford 
[02:13:30]  the trainer  so I'm just going  to eat all day  and not exercise  right  what the  he didn't buy that  that's what he said  and he lets her know  on a daily basis  let's go to the next clip  even if I were thin  it wouldn't matter  because he would  find something else  you're laying in bed  when I'm coming home  you lay in bed  and watch TV  you lay in bed  and talk on the phone  you could go out  and work  you could pull an income  and contribute  more than just  laying on the bed  all day  you're the biggest  slob in the world  wow why are these two  even married 
[02:14:00]  oh I know  they hate each other  and at the end  of course  at the end of the episode  they were kissing each other  they showed a sunset  and they're sitting out  on their porch  and the camera  is looking through  the window  of their house  so you know  it's all set up  and staged  yeah  he then  opens up a ring box  takes a ring out  and puts it on her finger  beautiful ring  and you know  they kiss  and the nanny's  looking out the window  like  my job here is done  no it's not  it's just awful  wasn't it a guy 
[02:14:30]  yeah it was a guy  or something  that was doing this  counseling  my job is done  perfect  Pete  alright we got a trucker  that likes his fat wife  Ryan  really  what's going on  you like your fat wife  oh she's not really fat  I mean she's like  the medium build  okay  but you know  I like her like that  I like in women  who's got some  it on the bone  was she skinny  when you married her  uh  she's probably  125  130  and we've had  two kids  since we got married  and she has 
[02:15:00]  put on some weight  but  I don't think  I'd have her  any other way  how much does she weigh now  uh  probably  I'd say  160  maybe  alright so she's put on  like 30  35 pounds  and how tall is she  uh  about 5'3  I'd say  she might be 5'4  but I mean  she's got some belly rolls on her  but she looks good  alright man  that's what you're into  that's fine  yeah you don't got  nothing wrong with that  I guess  well hey  I've been listening to you  for about two or three weeks  and I love y'all  and I'm not going to be  the stupid truck driver  that stays on the phone all day 
[02:15:30]  so I'm out  thank you my friend  bye mister  I'd like that  call on  keep her between the ditches  we personally offended the guy  I'm sure  and he's still listening  and enjoying the program  he's 10-8  so you can be honest  on your radio show  and people will still listen  it's just opinions  and you know  it's just crap  that we spew out every day  good point sugar  alright  let's go to this clip  although I guess  this is the reason  why they don't get  a divorce Anthony  in this clip  you're so hurt right  so if you want better  then go get better 
[02:16:00]  I've told you many times  get the hell out  the only reason  I like having you around  honestly  is because I don't want  to be a single mother  out there having to work  she doesn't want  to be a single mother  so that's why  her side of the story  that's why she stays  with the guy  having to work  one of their daughters  my daughters  they're dodging me  one of the daughters  actually wrote  on her little chalkboard  split up  or shut up  because they're just  arguing all the time  and in little  kiddie handwriting  is split up 
[02:16:30]  or shut up  because they're  constantly fighting  with each other  this is just hell  this guy  even her  they're just both  in this nightmare  that probably  sounded good  at one point  yeah we'll get married  we'll have kids  their kids are nightmares  their marriage is a nightmare  he doesn't love her  she doesn't love him  he thinks she's fat  she is fat  it's a mess  and you know what  the sad thing is though  it really is the kids  that suffer  the kids  what of the children 
[02:17:00]  yeah  good point  you stayed upstairs  I got everybody ready  by myself  that's your job  we agreed on that  Laura and I made a decision  early on  that I was going to be  the king of the castle  Chris we never really  did agree on that  you just told me that  over and over  that's your job  that's your job  that's your job  that's your job  what's your job  go out and work  and make the money  that's exactly my job  you want a medal  and then he goes  that's exactly my job  and she goes  you want to win a medal  that's what he does  oh my god  he should just quit his job  and just start sitting  around the house 
[02:17:30]  and watch everything  collapse around  there you go  just quit  you go out and work  you fat pig  selfish fool  you know  in families like this  in family situations  like this  the guy is working  that's his job  he comes home  she should be working too  around the house  that's it  there are other situations  where the woman  also is  you know  has a career  she goes out and works  and in those situations  both of them  if they can't afford  to have housekeepers  or anything like that 
[02:18:00]  have to contribute  to the house  that's how it works  but a woman like this  what she sees  is all this  all the stories  of the career women  that are saying  you know  get in here  and help out  you have to help out  also  because I work  and they interpret this  as something  they should be saying  she should be going  hey you help out  no  he goes to work  on a daily basis  you take care  of the house  that's how it works  unless you're well off  enough to hire people  to do it  well to do  well to do 
[02:18:30]  what am I spending  money on  do I take care of myself  do I go get my nails done  no  do I get my hair done  not even  but you could  yeah but you'd bitch about it  no I don't  I have five kids with me  I can't do these things  I'm so stuck  I can't do anything  Laura just lost interest  in doing the feminine things  all the foo-foo stuff  and I love that stuff  oh I see  you got reduced fat chips  good move  you know how I feel  they're probably 
[02:19:00]  a little more expensive  but it's worth it  oh what an asshole  this guy is classic  he is hysterical  oh I see  you got reduced fat  and then he looks  he gives her the up and down  on her fat body  he just looks her up and down  oh good one  I gotta play the other side  of this though  I mean the guy wants her  to be all ladylike  and stuff  but he decided  with her to have  five kids  five kids  right  there you go  eh  you know  something's gonna  I assume  something's gonna suffer  if you're gonna have  five kids 
[02:19:30]  maybe one or two kids  like that  she's gonna snap back  if she really puts  an effort to it  but after five  you're pretty much saying  you know that's a miracle  to get her to snap back  well I'm from a big family  when you have five, six  we had seven  for a while  yeah  lost one somewhere  she's still alive  I don't know where she is though  um  my mom didn't have time  to do lady stuff  because her whole time  was just trying to raise us  spent raising the kids  yeah  I mean I could see  maybe one or two  that you could still  maybe still  you know 
[02:20:00]  sneak in some lady stuff  but five  but five  you know  there's a funny part  she would try to walk  around the house  and he would step  on her uterus  and she's trying to walk  and she's just  pinned to the floor  let's go to Lost Boy  the trucker  hey Lost Boy  hey  yeah  you were talking about  wives porking up  after you marry them  oh I got the reverse  I uh  married my wife  she was a big girl  real big  lazy 
[02:20:30]  the only reason I married her  is because I fell in love  with her daughter  whoa  are you serious  whoa  no no no  hold on you guys  she had a  she had dad  just had a baby  six weeks  before we got together  oh so you know  you fell in love  in a different way  the idea of being a daddy  okay  I thought he fell in love  like uh oh  no no no  good way to get to her  I gotta step in here  uh  Anthony and I did a program  once on stepdaughters  yes  yeah  things that are going on 
[02:21:00]  and  we had  we had  fathers admit  that they are  looking at their  stepdaughters  they're looking at  he goes  you know  these guys are like  yeah  I fell in love  with the mom  uh  I  I  moved into the house  and there's nothing  going on  I would never do  anything to the daughter  but  it's  you know  a 17  or  a 16  17  18 year old girl  walking around the house  with her little tiny  Britney Spears outfits on  he goes  you're gonna look  it's not my daughter  so you're gonna look  and go  oh Jesus Christ  yeah 
[02:21:30]  I mean  they keep to themselves  they don't  turn on the perv switch  like we like to talk about  on the program  and then I guess  after a while  getting used to it  they walk around  in their little panties  oh  daddy  and you gotta go  scrap  because of that  but you can't  think of that  you gotta probably  focus on something else  otherwise you're gonna  feel like a complete deviant  oh  alright  lost boy  so uh  she was  you fell in love  with her daughter  and she was uh  a big woman  right  yep  we were together  we were together  five years  she was  corkly challenged  the thing was 
[02:22:00]  what's the kicker  is okay  about five years  before we got together  I had gotten sick  of being fat  I'd been fat  all my life  I was like  700 pounds  oh my god  yeah  wait how much  700 pounds  you're not the guy  ordering the  8  uh  X  uh  wait  what are they  8  uh  how do you  how do you do  shirt sizes  8X  thank you  we're all  bombing today  hold on  because  uh 
[02:22:30]  no  I don't know  because I wear  medium  what is it  8XL  you're looking at me  what is it  doing shirt sizes  it goes  well it's not 8M  8XL  yeah  8XL  alright  because really fast  because my  my brother's  taking pre-orders  for these  Opie and Anthony  spread the virus  t-shirts  yeah  hold on  hold on  the pre-ordering  is going to end  any day  like you have  today  maybe tomorrow  maybe  uh  Wednesday  to pre-order  these really cool  Opie and Anthony  spread the virus  t-shirts  which are on  opieandthony.com  it relates to this

[02:23:30]  I know this  I couldn't do  nothing  how much are you  now  that's the thing  when we got  together I was  190 pounds  it took me  I mean I just  I busted my butt  did you get the  stomach stapling  or no  no I didn't  no I didn't  I wanted to  but I thought  well I'm gonna  try to lose it  myself first  you lost about  500 pounds  yeah  I was averaging  I lost about  100 pounds  a year  did you have  like all that  extra skin 
[02:24:00]  or was there  what like  that's gotta be  that's a huge  loss  I was a lot  younger  so I had the  loose skin  but nothing  like what you  see people  that have that  stomach stapling  yeah okay  but anyway  she uh  make this quick  is she was a  big girl  I still loved  her  we ended up  having all kinds  of problems  and we got  a divorce  that now  you're gonna  want to use  the C-Word  C-Word alert  oh boy  hold on  hold on  we like when  you guys warn us

[02:26:00]  change  he's not  going to change  in a week  you know  he's just not  see you don't  really you don't  know him  everybody always  thinks he's  Mr. Wonderful  you know so  one day of him  taking care of me  doesn't impress me  yeah I can't do  anything right  it's just it  doesn't matter  what I do  I can't cook  right or clean  right or raise  the kids right  or nothing's good  enough for him  I've gone where  I've tried to be  overly nice and  do everything he  wants and that 
[02:26:30]  doesn't work  I love when  they get him  crying on this  always  even the guy  was like  getting all  emotional and  tearing up and  crying on the  episode  she's  fat  fat pig  yeah  little fat  chips  good one  by the way  someone came up  with the size  anthony  yeah  fat fuck  ff  oh double f  the size is  double f  for fat fuck  Jesus  well you know 
[02:27:00]  that's the goal  of just about  every show  out there on  TV  yeah  to get people  crying  even the sitcoms  have to do their  teary eyeball show  well this whole thing  you could just tell  this is all in the  editing  it's all in the  editing  they shoot for  ten days  whatever it is  and then they  piece this together  they uh  I'm sure they take  some of the days  where they're being  nice to each other  early on  and stick that at  the end of the show  to make it look like  they solve the problem  and I'm sure 
[02:27:30]  at the end of the show  they have plenty of  footage of them  yelling at each other  and they use that  earlier on in the show  it's all just about  how they make it look  like they're leaving  the house  a nice happy couple  because TV has to  wrap up everything  nicely  yes it does  I'm like why  they put this  commitment in  and by luck  every time they  go to a house  they fix the problem  that just happens  they're that amazing  there is one show  that they just  walk out and go  I don't know  what to tell you  you guys are doomed  you talk about reality  shows  why can't they  just be honest  and just show 
[02:28:00]  one of these episodes  where they just  couldn't get anything  done  couldn't get anything  done  you're a bunch  of low lives  and losers  die  we tried  but this is what  happened  we tried  that's the show  I'd watch  burn the house down  knowing it's not  going to be wrapped  up into a nice  tight little bow  at the end of the show  what did I do  nothing  Laura  what did I do  just how you come  in the door  you drop your stuff  and say yeah well  another three women  thought I looked  like Mel Gibson  today  I mean things  like that  you know  driving in the car

[02:29:00]  to a T  a woman  who'll look  good  on me  say  are you  about a size  14  are you  about a size  14  in order  to get victims  you've got to  lie and trick them  so I put my arm  inside a sling  I've got her in my sights  she's appropriately  fat  I'll wait for her  to notice me  I hope she fed  her cat  she's perfect  yes but one more  thing will need 
[02:29:30]  you to be seen  is she about  a size  14  she'll see you  with this couch  I'll get her  in the van  I'll punch her  in the face  and drive away  and that's the plan  I'll cut off  all her skin  and wear it  like a dress  I'll dump her  in the ocean  let the cops  clean up the mess  are you about  a size  14  are you about  a size  14  if you want  to find the one  you need  it's always a tough  and she's also  gotta be naive  I'll keep her  in a well 
[02:30:00]  they'll never  ever find her  I'll tuck my dick  between my legs  you'll think  it's her vagina  I'll look just  like a girl  by golly  I'll have fun  but for now  be quiet  she can make  a sample  so she calls  can I give you  a hand with that  you look a little  handy  cow  she's coming  towards the van  I'll ask her  to get in  I'll check her tag  and if she fits  I'll cut off  all her skin  are you about  a size  14  are you about  a size 
[02:30:30]  14  my aunt  he's in  blue sewing  and if you like  me let's get going  and I'll put you  in a hole  where you can  scream  I'll bet  she's a size  14  I'm looking  for a size  14  she brought  this on herself  because she  offered me  her help  and she's  an idiot  for trusting  me  are you  about  a size  14  this land  was worth  the waste  he saw her  in his trunk  she took  the bait  and now  she's  out of luck  that's one of 
[02:31:00]  our favorite things  from silence  of the lambs  the musical  by the kaplan  brothers  dude I love  the line  where he goes  something about  feeding the cat  it's like  that's how great  this is  they stay true  to the film  yeah  it's a little  detailed  brilliant man  we're gonna have  to find another  hit off this thing  yeah  we play that one  we've played  uh  put the lotion  in the basket  and we have tried  if I can smell her  she  yeah  you gotta take  it home  yeah  we'll find out  let's go to  Vicky in Jersey  Vicky  hey 
[02:31:30]  what's up  what's up  Vicky  we actually  I was talking  to my boyfriend  and we've had  this talk  about getting  fat  and he's  claimed  he doesn't  care  but it's  me  it's all  on my end  I don't feel  when he started  dating me  I was 140  pounds  I don't feel  I should gain  over that  regardless  of what he  says  so I'm  the one  running  while he's  there going  nah  don't worry  about it  have that  ice cream  whatever  is he afraid  you're going  to leave him  I don't think  so  because he's  standing here  right now  smiling  some of those  guys  they want 
[02:32:00]  to pork  up their  chicks  so they  don't leave  they keep  them fat  some guys  are like  fatty chasers  I'm not saying  that he is  but a lot  of guys  have this  horrible  motherly  fear of  abandonment  oh jeez  I work  in an  obesity lab  and I'm  terrified  of it  I see  the models  and I  shake  until I go  home  and I just  run  right out  what's an  obesity lab  please tell me  you put fat  people in  cages  no I'm a  medical student 
[02:32:30]  so I work  with trying  to come up  with drugs  or what not  it's all about  the food you eat  for the most part  oh yeah  but you'd be  amazed at how  much they don't  want to hear  hey put the  fork down  that's not  what they want  you know  Anthony  I think I'm  going to be a  little too lazy  to try out my  new bid on the  streets of New York  I think I want  to hand that  one over to  the listeners  the listeners  because this  is a lot  of audience  participation  going on  these days  you want  to take  my bid  and run  with it  and then  maybe I'll  do a few  as the leader  right  basically  you walk 
[02:33:00]  up to one  of these  outdoor cafes  you see  someone that's  just not  taking care  of themselves  having a  very fat  type of lunch  and they're  a big person  and you just  look them in the  eye  tape it for  the radio  and say  and you wonder  why you're fat  and see what  kind of reaction  you get  when you see  someone really  fat sitting  there eating  a salad  or some  grilled chicken  you're like  alright  that person's  trying to  get things  moving  it's not easy  but when you  see somebody  really overweight  eating something 
[02:33:30]  really bad  it's like  I understand  addiction  but there's  a time  where you have  to take  responsibility  and just  try to do  the right  thing  you usually  see them  in the malls  and there's  at least  two of them  two big  fatties  sitting there  at the food  court  just stuffing  their faces  looking at  the girls  I'm self  conscious  about my  torso  but you know  what  I've never  blamed  anybody  but myself  when I eat  I put weight  on  that's the way  it is  I don't exercise  I'm lazy  when I don't  eat or I eat  healthy  I lose weight  that's the reality  make a decision

[02:46:30]  hang out socialize  you've been there  huh yeah many times  ross have you been  there never even  heard of it  good answer  great job  look carlos  that's the answer  we're looking for  carlos sosa  i don't like him  suing  25 grand  he's uh trying to  get because he  claims that  gay sex is rampant  in the locker room  and this is a posh gym  this is one of these  uppity up uh gyms  there anthony  and that the club  staff has been unable  to stop the steamy  hijinks  since when his ass  fucking called hijinks  by the way 
[02:47:00]  what's the address  on that  oh  yeah  i'll give you that  it's not gay  if you just stop  in the workout  and get blown  uh  he says he was shocked  to see men  performing sex acts  on each other  in the shower  uh  is it ogling  or ogling  ogling  or ogling  i always say ogling  i say ogling  i say ogling  ogling would be  two o's anthony  ogling  ogling  i say ogling  ogling  what do you say  ogling  ogling 
[02:47:30]  ogling  ogling  ogling  i've been mispronouncing  that word  i add that to the list  of words i mispronounced  great  just like peeping at him  looking  longingly  looking at him  in the locker room  and leering  at him as he changed  his clothes  the gym misrepresents  what it's all about  says sosa's lawyer  they represented themselves  as a serious place  where you could actually  work out  where you could actually  work out  is this like  you can't even work out  in here  is it that bad  you expect me to believe  they're faggots 
[02:48:00]  because sosa says so  sosa says so  no  i don't fuck men  it becomes a  saucy steam room  that reminds me of  the ancient roman baths  is what sosa said  what is he a time traveler  how does this remind him  of the  it reminded him  the ancient roman baths  he's been there  can't just live another life  the david barton gym  once hailed as one of the city's  hottest new workout centers  when it opened last year  in a building that housed 
[02:48:30]  the ymca  that reputedly inspired  the famous village people  gay anthem  the ymca  that should tell you  something right there  absolutely  well this building  has a history  they needed a security guard  to monitor the showers  the locker room  and the steam room  if that's not peculiar  i don't know what is  so apparently  they know there's a little  issue  so they have a security guard  that monitors  the areas  where all this  gay sex is going on  a lawyer for david barton 
[02:49:00]  blasted the suit  as frivolous  and without merit  so the client  runs a clean establishment  he claims he first  noticed the sexual  frolicking in november  a few weeks after  he started exercising  at the gym  which charged him  950 dollars  for a membership  is that a lot of money  for a gym membership  oh yeah it is  950 bucks  he said one day  he was walking  into the shower area  here we go  this is where it gets hot  he spotted an employee  calling out to someone  in a stall  he said he saw men  getting it on  through the gaps 
[02:49:30]  between the two stalls  what are you peeking for  fruitcake  stop looking  these guys  were doing something  to each other  he said  you could see it  in a silhouette  sounds sexy  doesn't it  I'm getting hot  doesn't that sound  I really am  all steamy silhouette  looks like they're  banging two little  lego people together  and you realize  it's their cocks touching  maybe they're just  good at shadow puppets  they're just wanting  to throw everyone off  I don't know  I saw one head bobbing  and then a little bird  flying above  Sosa said he was 
[02:50:00]  so disturbed by the  experience  and other times  when men came  on to him  he was afraid  to use gym  amenities  such as the steam room  he claimed he saw  gym employees  trying to stop  the shenanigans  shenanigans  but said their efforts  were ineffectual  now I'm really  uncomfortable  and I'm paying  for this he said  I felt I had to  avoid the steam room  because god knows  if I'll step on  something I don't  want to step on  he's talking about 
[02:50:30]  maybe a little  pile of jizz  on the floor  that's why they do  it in the shower  though it should  clean it up  fairly quickly  right down the drain  no muss  no fuss  and he can wash  your hair  while you're  blowing someone  that's gotta be  you know  he's putting  his hands in your  hair  just rub that  scalp a little  put a little  shampoo there  it's all lathered up  as he's pressing  the back of your head  and read this part  right here  it says  everywhere I would walk  they would stare  at my big cock  and make remarks  at plaintiff  Ben Sparks  he's not gonna 
[02:51:00]  come in  he's not gonna  come in with that  so so  let's see  he claims  the last straw  came in January  when a man  approached him  in the locker room  while it was empty  sat uncomfortably  close to him  and leered at him  it's bad enough  in a regular gym  that all these  shenanigans  as they so eloquently  put it  are going on  when you're in  the locker room  and there's  naked guy  that's just  walking around  it's really simple  I work out  at a regular gym  and you've told  you've told  a story in the past 
[02:51:30]  as well  and there are guys  that just openly  walk around the  locker room  completely naked  completely naked  no reason to  I mean  if you're naked  more than the time  it takes  to  if you're gonna  take a shower  or whatever  to take your  underpants off  and put a towel  on  you're gay  or you're done  take the towel  put your underwear on  now you're dressed  there's no reason  to take the towel off  get out of the shower  as you're drying  your bag  and everything  and then walk around  these guys have  blow dry their hair  completely naked  it's like why  in front of the mirrors 
[02:52:00]  by the sink  their pelvis  sticking out  yeah look at my cock  the hell is that  all about  there's no need  for that  of course not  many years ago  Florentine and I  were doing these  sketches for MTV  it was Rich Franchese's  had a show  in a bathroom stall  it was actually  in a New York  this was many years  maybe 8-9 years ago  in a New York gym  and there was a guy  me and Jim  were so immature  we were standing there  at the mirror  and this guy came over  totally nude  and starts blow drying  his hair  and I'm not kidding  his cock was standing 
[02:52:30]  straight out  it might have been  an inch long  me and Jim  are in the mirror  like he's on one side  I'm on the other  we look in the mirror  make eye contact  both look down  at the guy's hog  and just fucking  start laughing  we had to walk out  of the gym  two men laughing  at your junk  just two guys  laughing at the  tiny genitals  of another man  it was so immature  we had to walk out  he should have  just killed himself  when I finish today  I'm going over  to the friars club  and take a steam  and what you're  talking about  is basically just  what happens 
[02:53:00]  every moment  over there  really  that's just  nobody  you take your clothes  off actually  before you enter  the building  there's a place  you check your clothes  outside  you're out on the street  you walk in naked  and they're all  very cordial  and no problem  yes  and they've had to move  the powdering area  because you powder  after you take a steam  you powder yourself  so you don't chafe  and they've had to move it  because there was so much  powder going on  that it was going through  the circulation system  the ventilation system  it was shutting down  the ventilation system 
[02:53:30]  because everyone's  powdering up  what the hell is going on  over at the friars  a bunch of 80 year old  old showbiz faggots  just cleaning off  looking at each other  naked  I love  powdering my anus  there's just  I'm just saying to myself  I don't believe I'm doing this  I'm just running my hand  up and down the crack of my butt  in front of other people  applicator or just your hand  yeah I use an applicator  it is called my hand  really  just a hand  no powder puff  powdering your ass  is kind of like the way  astronauts would have  semen thrown on it 
[02:54:00]  just dried up  like a tank  kind of  it's like  why did I have to  get a cum joke  what's wrong with me  you had to  my apologies  no  exactly  it's the fact  they bring it with them  and it's already  freeze dried  just add water  and throw the load  in someone's face  that's a good friend  trying to bail me  out of my awful bomb  thank you  I'm fucking sinking  that one myself  Sosa claims he soon  has to be let out  of the gym contract  but was refused  said after several  attempts to work  the matter out  he decided to bring  the civil suit 
[02:54:30]  you think there's a  possibility he's just  a cheap fuck  and wanting his money  back  it seems like it's  a pretty prestigious  gym  it says here  Matt Dillon  Susan Sarandon  Calvin Klein  have all been spotted  at this upscale gym  the membership contract  clearly states that  such behavior  is not tolerated  when it has to be  in your contract  that no blowjobs  should be going on  in the shower  should tell you  something right there  but he wants  his membership  feedback and  $25,000  for emotional  distress  luck 
[02:55:00]  it is disturbing  to be around  that kind of  activity  if you don't  like it  is it  yeah  well I wouldn't  know  but  you were in the  army  you do know  yeah I saw it  on a daily basis  in the army  oh sure  really  but this was  back  they didn't have  the standards  they do now  they let me in  and anything  could go on  in that situation  really  yeah  just two men  alone  very rarely  were they alone  there was usually  like some sort  of a line  a bunch of guys  next 
[02:55:30]  general son  tell us about  the general son  what is this  there was this  there was this guy  this was 1973  this is 1973  and there was this  and he seemed gay  I didn't know  what gay was  at that time  but he just was  very effeminate  and everything  and one time  I was a squad  leader  and they actually  six black guys  had him in the  corner  and they were  forcing him  to do them  one at a time  and I came in  to break it up  I was 145 pounds  I had a neck 
[02:56:00]  the size of your wrist  good job  and I broke it up  and they let him go  and then they corner me  oh no  and I got out of there  with  I think I had to do two  you know  I was like  Tim Robbins  in Shawshank Redemption  you know  if you do this  you stick it in my ear  it's going to  make my jaw lock up  and you're going to lose  whatever's in it  it's going to be  bitten off  oh my god  that's funny  I'd peek in and go 
[02:56:30]  okay  you boys have fun  but you know  you can threaten them  that you're going to  bite their cock off  but when it comes  right down to it  it's very difficult  to do  you know  because you  you tend to  over empathize  with your attacker  it's the Stockholm  syndrome  of cock sucking  that's right  well  I know that  if I was in this  situation  I'd want it  to feel like this  and not have to  be afraid  of having it  bitten off  who am I  to judge  Ross Bennett  everyone  that's funny 
[02:57:00]  that's really good  so that's about it  Anthony  with the gay gym  I don't know  about the 25 grand  for emotional distress  though  it just seems like  something you would want  I obviously give the guys  membership back  if he's not into  that kind of thing  but as far as  emotional distress  you've got stories  to tell your buddies  I walked in there  and how funny would it be  to walk in the bathroom  here  and look in the  crack in the stall  and see two guys  going at it  you'd come back in here  and laugh  you might  well Jimmy  would come back  and wipe his mouth  off and then laugh 
[02:57:30]  emotional distress  is if they didn't  want to do you  that's the emotional  distress  maybe he was  feeling a little  dejected  the whole thing  sure  I joined the  David Barton  gym and I sued  so I was in the  locker room  eyeing someone up  and they said  beat it fatty  I was so hurt  so hurt  they weren't  ogling or ogling  or leering  or ogling  shenanigans going on  I think we got a guy  that used to work  at the gym  Chris from New York  Chris  fellas I actually  used to work  at the Reebok  club on the  Upper West Side  but one of my  trainer friends  asked me if I could  fill in for him  for the day  down at the 
[02:58:00]  Barton gym  and so I go down  there I'm just  going to paint a  picture for you  you know when  you're at a party  and a new hot  girl walks in  and everyone  turns to look  yeah  that's what it's  like being a  trainer there  the first day  you go there  oh my god  and to paint the  picture even more  it's like doing  a training session  at Studio 54  Circus 81  oh come on  upstairs  come on upstairs  you walk in  and you  you hide up and  down by 40  people it's like  you're on a  runway when you  walk in  and then like  you said 
[02:58:30]  if they don't  look at you  and I'm a  straight guy  you start  getting a  conflict  like man  why aren't  these guys  looking at  me  it's nice  to be asked  yeah  that description  is not over  the top  what that guy  said  why don't they  just give the  guy his money  back  if a guy  acts like  he's going  to sue  just give him  back his  900 bucks  yeah  right there  Chris  yeah  you got the  looks though  well yeah  like you said  I heard about  the place  and I heard  the reputation  of yeah  it's pretty  much a gay  place down  in Chelsea  to work out  but it's also  had a great 
[02:59:00]  reputation  as a nice  facility  got nice  abs and stuff  on you  Chris  yeah  had a great  reputation  but yeah  you walk in  and you got  the cheap  t-shirt on  the David Barton  black tight  t-shirt  and it pretty  much goes  from there  like you said  it's like  doing a  training session  Studio 54  did you get  out of there  alive  yeah  you got  out of there  alive  but like  you go home  and you try  to explain  it to your  girlfriend  what you did  for a living  today  and it  doesn't come  off well  in any way  you gotta scrub  off in the  shower  nothing worse  than the smell  of a fucking  men's locker room 
[02:59:30]  it's like doing  a training session  at West 4th  Street bathroom  balls and ass  thanks Chris  it's awful  every locker room  that's why  even you know  a high school  locker room  it's the same  thing  you walk in  and just  ugh  didn't you have  a story where  you were at a hotel  or something  and you wanted  to just go for a  swim  was that in Boston  and you had to  walk through the gym  and you told this  one story once  and you were just  horrified by just  the nudity  yeah well you had to  walk through the 
[03:00:00]  locker room  right that's what I  mean  to the pool  the pool  I mean  yeah  and I'm just  you know  I'm just in my  swim trunks  I got my towel  your swim trunks  pulled up a little  too high  all high  right under my  nipples  and I'm just  walking through  just want to go  for a dip in the  pool  and I want nothing  to do with a  men's locker room  at that moment  I just want to  go into a pool  but you have to  walk through the  locker room  and it was a  gauntlet of  penis and ass  and nutsack  just walking through 
[03:00:30]  and they're all  talking to each  other naked  and the bend over  to dry your foot  as it's up on  the bench guy  he's got his ass  just sticking out  into the aisle  I'm walking past  it's like if I  want to go to a  pool why should I  have to walk  inches away from  hairy man ass  I shouldn't  I tell you  I was working out  at New York  sports clubs  and sports club  in Huntington  once  and you see the  same people  you know  worked out there  all the time  and you start  acknowledging people 
[03:01:00]  because you see  them all the time  because it's awkward  when you're going  from machine to  machine  and I see this  one guy  and you know  so many times  I finally figure  I might as well  say hey  you know  so he's kind of  nodding at me  and I go  hey what's going  on  he goes  I'm going to  go take a  shower  alright  and I'm like  great  why would he  say that  how about we  start with  hey how are  you  is that like  I don't know  is that a code  word  I don't know  maybe it's a code  word  you know  New York sports  clubs 
[03:01:30]  they're legitimate  at gyms  but this guy  had to tell me  he was going  to take a shower  I don't know  if he was expecting  me to follow  I didn't know  what the hell  was going on  wow  it was the most  awkward thing  because how do you  answer that  well you go  take that shower  be right in  the answer  it's really weird  it might have been  actually code for  I need to take  a shower  you think it meant  nothing  yeah it could have  just been you know  I don't know you guys  it's a great show  you are a bit  homophobic  I'm going to be honest 
[03:02:00]  one of the things  I like  I like about gyms  is I like being  around men  yeah  and you know  having to be naked  not be an issue  having my body  not be an issue  going to the steam room  I love that whole  I love the homoerotic  nature of the whole event  you see  when he was talking  about  when he was talking  about the Roman baths  I would have  I would have  I would do anything  to go back  and spend an hour  in the Roman bath  back in time  to have a slave  scraping my back 
[03:02:30]  and applying olive oil  a young male slave  doing that  I don't even care  how old  I mean if they're  behind you  what difference does it make  that's true  what they stand  on a couple of phone books  some people  don't seem to care  those ancient  papyrus phone books  those Roman phone books  yeah what  that's right  V-I-V-I-I  X-I-V-I  X-I-V-I  oh he's not home  for Alexandria  and surrounding 
[03:03:00]  fuck surrounding  oh  damn  Jimmy  resounding areas  got it out  oh well  in my building  oh wait  sorry  that's right  there's actually  a steam room  and I would go into it  but I would wear  a bathing suit  I would never go in naked  I just couldn't go in naked  yeah  I mean it's helping  do that with the towel  and then they take  the towel off  while they're in there  now I don't have a bathing suit on  why would you  a bathing suit  I just like that  Ross Bennett noticed  that we're a homophobes  we are 
[03:03:30]  being on the show  for 10 minutes  we're the worst  it has nothing to do  mind you  with any type of  condoning of violence  for homosexuals  or anything like that  I don't care  they don't gross me out  it's not like that  but as far as being  homophobic  in that I just  don't want to see it  or have to be  have to deal with it  around me  that's when I'm  homophobic  in a locker room  something like that  there's no reason  for naked guy  to be walking around  none whatsoever  naked guy  he should know 
[03:04:00]  that other people  probably don't want  to see his schlong  flapping around  as he goes from  the shower  to his locker  although if you're gay  I mean  you can't  not gay guys  where are you  supposed to go  alright well  there's a bunch  of naked people  walking around  there was like  all chicks  why should they  be the lucky geese  that's what I'm saying  why can't I  you know  it would be nice  if I could walk  into a girls locker room  and just sit around  and watch them  walking around nude  maybe I'm just  a little jealous  why don't you  show up and tease them  that delicious  Italian body of yours  and just walk out  with your tight slacks 
[03:04:30]  that's what I'll do  hi ladies  give out the wrong number  yeah  hey we got a  maybe a good story  here on the phones  Beth in Seattle  Beth  hey  hi guys  how's it going  what's up Beth  hi  I actually did  hook up with a girl  in a locker room  once  wait you hooked up  with a girl  in a gym locker room  yeah  it happens  it was really cool  well  how did it happen  well we were  I was  I was 
[03:05:00]  I woke up  at like 2 in the morning  and I go swimming  and there was no one around  and this chick came out  I'd seen her there  a couple times before  and she was like  you know  walking around naked  which a lot of women do  which isn't always  a good thing  in those locker rooms  but she came out  and was like  talking to me  and saying hi  and I'm gonna  wait wait wait  let's slow down  are you putting this picture  in your head  of course  I can play  it's playing like a movie  in my head  this could be the hottest thing  alright so wait  you're done swimming

[03:06:00]  and  and  what's going on  in your head  are you like  bisexual  lesbian  what's going on  with you  well  I don't know  I'm a college student  whatever  I don't know  you girls are just  freewheeling these days  I love it  how old is she  was she your age  or older  um  she's probably  a bit older  she's like  20  I don't really know  I would guess  she's in her  mid to late 20s  good  and how old were you  I am  I'm 20  20  so young  so tender  so innocent  wow 
[03:06:30]  teen  lesbianism  so what happened  well  she  we started talking  and I've seen you  around the gym  and I saw you  out at this place  one time  and she's naked  while you're talking  to her  yeah  and you have  your little swimsuit on  yeah  it was very disconcerting  I mean  you're talking to someone  and it's hard enough  when you're  you know  talking to someone  with clothes on  not to let your eyes  kind of wander down  right  yeah  naked  you're like  uh  hi  when did you get  to the fingering  hopey 
[03:07:00]  hold on  just grab her bush  hey  nice bush  when did it get  to the point  where you're like  oh my god  I need that  well she  she actually  took the first step  she kind of like  kept taking steps  towards me  yeah  and I was like  standing  against the locker  and she's like  so um  hey  can I kiss you  and I was like  did you just go like this  shivering

[03:10:30]  sandals down first  so that her knees  didn't actually  have to touch  the gross  slimy  so she looked like  when you try  to make yourself  look like a midget  and put your shoes  on your knees  and stand there  a dwarf  dwarf  dwarf on pussy eating  temp conway  going down  on you  hey man  you're wrecking  this  sorry  you know  like the next  day she'd wake  up with like  acid foot  on her knee  or something  like that  that is so funny  dwarf  oh  mrs  she got a

[03:15:30]  or 81  Richard Pryor  was working  out his live  on Sunset  strip at the  comedy store  and so by  the second or  third week he  was doing it  everybody in  Hollywood is  there so this  room that should  see 200  has like 300  people in it  people are  stuffed in the  aisles standing  and the doorman  kept walking by  Tony Danza  and he'd brush up  against him  and he goes  if he does that  again I'm gonna  deck him  wow  didn't even see  his hand move  all I saw was  this guy on the  floor  he punched  him in the  head  yeah  see we've been  saying this on

[03:17:30]  you're just hating it  the cover art  you buy it for the  cover art  well you know what I  mean I don't know  that was always horrible  back in like the  early 80s when gaming  first started  like home computer  gaming  and the cover art  was great  you'd look at this  and go  oh this game  looks fantastic  hey how you doing  this is Joe  and we just get  stuff being played  over the top  was that Nathaniel  was that your  fuck up  what was that  fan  a promo  for one of  brother Joe's gigs 
[03:18:00]  playing over the top  of our program  alright well we gotta  get through this game  look how nervous he is  look how nervous  his hand is over his  mouth  he's like oh my god  I screwed up  they're not going to  talk about my segment  today  he's in the main seat  today because Derek's  not here  and actually he's been  doing a great job  until that  right until that  right exactly  he looked like the  barber in the  untouchables when he  accidentally nicked  I'm sorry  and then you gave him  this look  nah that's ok  that's ok  just wait till we get  off the air and get  you back in the office

[03:19:30]  well that's  what I was  saying  the old  video games  the cover art  was so good  I remember  Microsoft  Flight Simulator  it was like  I'd always loved  the flight simulators  now they're  amazing  like the latest  one that's out  now  I mean you get  the photorealistic  grounds  and airport  and actual  airline traffic  and it's just  as difficult  to fly this  thing as it is  a real aircraft  it's just  really detailed  the first one  that's the number  one game in the  Middle East  they love it  the first one 
[03:20:00]  the cover art  was of a Cessna  flying over the  countryside  I think you're  scared Ross  all this  you know  you can fly  an airplane  Microsoft Flight  Simulator  you get it  it's one single  line as a horizon  and some  very crude  instrumentation  just some numbers  on round circles  and it refreshed  like I guess  the refresh rate  was one frame  every three seconds  so you got this  choppy kind of  movement  and it was just  impossible to try  to fly this thing 
[03:20:30]  as a realistic  flight simulator  and then they got  the hang of it  but at that time  it was like  I can't believe this  it's just like  flying a real airplane  it was horrible  all based on the  cover art  they'd have that  Tarzan game  or one of those  like Frogger  or something  it would look  all exciting  on the cover art  that's what I mean  you get it home  and it was just awful  because we all know  the main titles  you want to play  but then after a while  you've played them all  and so you're always  searching for that game  that might be cool  that you didn't hear about  and it's always because  the artwork looks good  alright let's go to  Theo in Virginia 
[03:21:00]  Theo  hey  what's up  I want to hear  Ricky's speech today  I've been waiting  for Ricky's speech  oh Ricky's report  on sarcasm  yeah  totally forgot about that  alright we'll do that next  when we come back  here's what I'm thinking  I'm thinking uninterrupted  like let the boy shine  just for a minute  and let him  maybe he'll break  into a stride  toward the end  or middle or so  and it could be great  good point fella  alright we'll do that  alright it's  Playstation Portable  PSP  I just know it is PSP  that's alright  I don't know what it is  they're also reminding us  that we would

[03:23:00]  go crazy  bye  let's do it  it's the OPNM video  and  we're back  with the OPNM program  Ross Bennett sitting in with us today  thank you Ross  anything you want to plug  just in case we forget 
[03:23:30]  to thank you  or  oh yeah  I'm going to be at the  I'm going to be on a cruise ship  I want to plug the fact  that I want to kill myself  on a daily basis  what ship are you going to be on?  I'm going to be on the  NCL  the Norwegian  I don't know  oh is it the one that  no no  I'm going to be over  doing a Mexican cruise this week  oh  Mexican  nice  I'll be at the stress factory  in the summer  that's my big gig  they hook you up though  on those ships huh?  not in the least  no?  they give me a room  that's their version 
[03:24:00]  of hooking you up  is it a nice big suite  with a balcony?  no  I mean I'm not in the crew area  no  although some ships  I am in the crew area  because there's nothing  more comfortable  than not having a window  on a ship  that is a little  a little troubling  if you can't look out the window  and kind of see something  I feel like Carrie  you know in the closet  you know  and I just put a bunch of  you know religious relics  on the wall  and I pray until my mother  lets me out  but no  that's my big life right now  do they make you pay for the  I'll tell you  could you at midnight  flip on the bilge pump 
[03:24:30]  and then turn it off  it's your only duty here  we're always right over the  even when I'm in the  passenger area  I'm always right over  the engine room  the engine room  yeah  pretty noisy  wow  do they make you pay  for your own food?  no the food  everything's included  alright  so you're making money  off the gig  if I drink  oh that's why I go  well you never know  what some of these gigs  I've heard you guys have to do  the  I just go  because it's the best money  I can make  at this particular point  in my career  do they  do they  do you stay on  for the entire cruise  or do they drop you off 
[03:25:00]  somewhere and fly back  sometimes  it depends  sometimes I fly in  I did a month  in South America  I did Valparaiso Chile  around to  Argentina  whatever the big city is  in Argentina  who knows  who even cares  down there  but I went around  the horn twice  going back and forth  really  but that was like  you're on for the  duration  even though I did  like four shows  in a month  but this one  I'm going to go in  they're going to fly me  in halfway into the cruise  like they'll fly me  into Acapulco  and I just like 
[03:25:30]  saying that  and then they're  going to take me  up to Los Angeles  and I'll fly back home  so I only do  half the cruise  but I get paid  for the full week  I always wondered  that because  last cruise we were  on the comic  that was there  a couple of days  in he was just  gone and I  assume they  threw him  overboard  it depends  everybody has  a different  kind of a deal  it's whatever  they can make  they run it  through a computer  and if getting  your ass off  the boat  is going to  save them  ten bucks  then you're  back home  sleeping in your  own bed  trade you for  some fuel  well we got 
[03:26:00]  Ricky in the  studio  Ricky  oh his mic  ain't  that's alright  like it really  needs to be on  he's got his  headphones on  he's a professional  so you're growing  a beard too  that's nice  yeah  are you  yeah  that should  come in  in a mustache  wow  2010  yeah really  more hair  on little  Connor Peterson's  tummy  than on your  chin  why don't you  just shave  it  for real  once in a while  I just gotta  shave it  anything that  shows up  just get rid  of it  because it  looks dirty  yeah when it  comes in like  peach fuzz  it ain't happening 
[03:26:30]  there were more  hairs in the  Yates's bathtub  yeah  so Ricky  we forgot  why did we  make you do  a report on  sarcasm  because I don't  get sarcasm  he doesn't  get sarcasm  yeah but why  I mean  how did that  come about  again  remember Nathaniel  oh okay  I'm sorry  yes  Nathaniel was  sitting in the  office  and for some  reason he's  working very hard  and for some  reason there were  a bunch of  chairs  empty chairs  just around  his chair  and he looked  around I guess 
[03:27:00]  maybe he was  gonna get up  or something  he looked around  and went  Jesus  could I get  another seat  around me  and um  yeah  Ricky uh  then got up  and started  pushing the big  couch  in our office  over toward him  as to get  another seat  over by Nathaniel  Ross has taken  off his uh  glasses  he has pushed  the mic away  he doesn't  even want  to be part  of this  now if you  were goofing  on sarcasm  that would  be funny  if he was  in fact  going alright 
[03:27:30]  and tried  to push it  but was  was playing  a little joke  on Nathaniel  that would  be funny  the fact  of the matter  is you  actually were  doing what  Nathaniel said  give me  another seat  yeah I just  heard him say  that I said  oh let me  just react  on it  just do it  and  you'd make  a great  Nazi  just follow  the orders  who cares  what they're  saying  I'm not  I'm not even  thinking about  the logic  that goes into  what he's  saying  he wants  a seat  I'll get  him a seat  he wants  me to  open up  this can  and dump  it in the  top of  this roof  vent  I'm doing  it 
[03:28:00]  let's get  Nathaniel  in  Zyklon B  Zyklon A  I don't  know what  the hell  it is  I'm not  even going  to ask  Nathaniel  yes sir  so what  were you  thinking  when this  went down  I was  thinking  that can't  possibly be  the actions  of another  human being  by the way  congratulations  Nathaniel  oh right  congratulations  are in order  well we're  going to do  it tomorrow  because we're  running out of  time but you  won some kind  of a comedy  contest right  yes a laugh  off if you  will  a laugh  off at the  comedy cellar  a laugh 
[03:28:30]  off at the  cellar  you got up  there you  did your  schtick  yep  and it was  well received  sure was  who judged  this  it was sort  of the  applause  thing at the  end  oh  applause  o meter  yes  right  they put a  hand over  everyone's  head  kind of  and just  said  and he won  that's awesome  winner is  Nathaniel  and everyone  clapped  and what  do you win  I win  four spots  at their  new talent  show for  the next  four weeks  oh  so 
[03:29:00]  any  nice  any good  free  performance  we got  your winning  performance  we're going  to get  into it  tomorrow  all right  cool  we're going  to give it  some time  thank you  all right  but first  it's Ricky  and his  report on  sarcasm  Ross  jump in  whenever you  want  gotcha  this kid  won't even  know that  you're making  fun of him  so just  just let  it rip  he's a good  boy  go ahead  Ricky  read  he screws  everything up  by the way  too  see these guys  in the booth  over there  those are interns  they don't get  paid to be here  they do a job  as if  they were being  paid  hundreds of  thousands of  dollars a day  to be here  they work very 
[03:29:30]  hard  they're picking  up the business  they know  their shit  Ricky is also  an intern  he doesn't get  paid  he's just  buying his  completely clueless  we can't even  fake it anymore  that he's going  to pursue  some line  of employment  in this business  and be successful  it's just  over for him  he should go  to McDonald's  and get a job  there  you really  don't have  what it takes  I don't think  things could  change  who am I  to say  but from  what I'm  seeing right  now  I stink  you stink 
[03:30:00]  he has no  confidence  whatsoever  no confidence  constantly being  beat down  the sad thing  is when you  said that to him  there was no  sarcasm whatsoever  no  I've never seen  such earnestness  this was like  Pope John Paul  II's deathbed  every statement  was being made  yes father  yes  yes  so we figured  a good start  for him here  would be to  be able to  identify something  like sarcasm  sarcasm is used  on this program  a lot  and he seems 
[03:30:30]  to his first test  in the office  with Nathaniel  in the chair  he didn't really  pass the sarcasm test  so we instructed  him to make  a little report  on sarcasm  and what it is  and I guess  how you use it  so you got  your  you didn't  give a handout  to Ross  he only had  three  that's okay  I'll hear it  for the first  time  and I'll get  on another level  alright and  Ricky start  from the top  because I know  we tried to  get into this  a while back  and then we  had to cut you  off or something  I was nervous  and drunk  at the same 
[03:31:00]  time  so it was  worse  now this time  I'm just nervous  because I hate  doing prepared  speeches  wow you're good  off the cuff  right  you like to riff  you're a little  nervous why  I don't know  I really just  hate doing  speeches  or whatever  is his mic  really low  or is he  just speaking  I can't even  crank it up  it's a shame  level  why don't we  invite everyone  in for the  report on sarcasm  yeah get everybody  in here  he's looking  Nathaniel's like  Nathaniel's like  you know what  Nathaniel's like  right now 
[03:31:30]  it's like when  Kirk beams down  to the planet  he takes like  Spock with him  and stuff  and all of a sudden  Scotty's at the  helm  like you're not  used to seeing him  there but he  can't leave  he can't just  leave and beam  down also  now who's up  it's like  Chekhov's at the  helm now  wait I wanted  Martini Steve in  here too though  Steve's over there  yeah we want  everyone in here  for the report  on sarcasm  alright now we're  getting the guy  Riley  now Riley's  at the helm  wait I want  Eric in here too 
[03:32:00]  why are you  taking over  oh no  Jesus  and now here  comes Eric  we don't need  anyone at the  board  we really don't  need anyone  at the board  for what  what's going to  happen at the  board  what could possibly  happen  now there's  no one at the  helm  we want Ben  in here  this is Ricky's  report on sarcasm  alright Ricky  look how nervous  Ricky is  look how nervous  Ricky is  we're all here  don't be nervous  now I want your  voice to be  clear  be assertive  what happened  there Ben  have confidence  have confidence 
[03:32:30]  in what you're  saying  speak loudly  into the  microphone  use your radio  voice  right  let's go  we've heard you  on the radio  you're very good  off the cuff  thanks Jimmy  here you go  alright this is  Ricky's report  on sarcasm  go ahead  my report on  sarcasm  starting on the  definition of  sarcasm  a cutting  often ironic  remark  intending to  wound  why are you  nervous  you're blowing  through this  you're screwing  up every word 
[03:33:00]  slow down  man  it's like a  seven word  sentence and  you muffed  four of them  come on end  of a car  commercial  it's not like  there's a lot  of people listening  it's not like  there's people  listening all over  the country right  now let's just  calm down a little  bit  enough with the  mumble mouth  speak  you realize that  XM's going to  reach four  million subs  any day now  right  okay so it's  not like there's  a lot of people  listening let's  calm down a little  bit take a deep  breath and start  over sound like  there's a ton of  people just staring  at you here in  the studio  right  let's just relax 
[03:33:30]  all right just  picture everyone  naked if that  relaxes you  it'll see Jim  it worked in  that Brady Bunch  episode once  right  in their underwear  it was the  driving test  Marsha had to  take the driving  test she was  very nervous she  pictured a driving  instructor in the  underwear  so picture everyone  naked  what do you see  when you look at  Jimmy naked  I don't know  I don't think I  want to see Jimmy  naked  no wonder you  don't like prepared  stuff whenever you  fly off the cuff  it's magic  all right let's go 
[03:34:00]  let's go  sarcasm  you know that  you know his mic  is up so high that  it's taking away from  everyone else's mic  look at this  yeah it got loud  all of a sudden  watch this  hey I'm completely  off mic you can  hear me now I  shut my mic off  sound good  you can hear me  now  on this mic  you're messing up  everyone's microphones  I gotta turn you  down a little bit  so you're gonna  have to use your  booming voice  use your voice  radio voice Ricky  all right let's go  it's the big boy voice 
[03:34:30]  all right everyone  just stare at Ricky  go ahead buddy  don't be nervous  sarcasm  a cutting often  ironic remark  intended to wound  like if someone says  hey that's really smart  that you pronounce  the T in often  and what's a wound  uh wound  a wound  yeah you didn't  really pronounce that  right  well we're picking  apart every little  thing now  let's let them  roll a little  all right  the second definition  a form of wit  that is remarked  by the use of  sarcastic language  and is intended  to make 
[03:35:00]  all right  what  it's a victim  remarked  yes remarked  a form of wit  that is remarked  by the use of  sarcastic language  could you read this  yeah that was really  nice Jim  yeah  you have to  read you wrote it  right  yeah I wrote it  when I was drunk  well then you should  no just read it  don't worry so much  yeah  no one cares the fact  that you have a nose  like the vulture  from the spider-man cartoon  your beard makes you  look like a nun 
[03:35:30]  you really should  shave  I mean  Italian grandmother  face  that's right  little hairs  I want some  I want some pasta  poking down like that  read it nice  a form of wit  that is marked  by the use of  sarcastic language  and is intended  to make its victim  the butt of  contempt or ridicule  good  I don't think you should  use the word  you're trying to define  in the definition  you're defining sarcasm 
[03:36:00]  by saying  it's use of  sarcastic language  good point  good point  sarcasm  see sarcasm  doesn't work  yeah  that was the definition  I was given  I don't know  I just put it  alright shut up  let's go  relax  alright  yeah  I don't know  I'm going to skip  the  no you're not  no you're not  don't think  the root of the word  is what's important here  yeah  that's right  it's from the  it's the late Latin word  sarcasmus  that comes from  sarcosmos  and then from 
[03:36:30]  sarcesian  which means  to bite the lip  in rage  snare  which is taken  from the ancient  Greek word  for flesh  sarx  what does that mean  not a clue  so you just  wrote this down  it's pretty much  plagiarized  from a website  yeah this course  part was just  definitely plagiarized  you didn't do anything  to maybe understand  what you were writing down  yeah  well he's giving a  definition I think  Ricky's trying to  give a definition  and go this is what  it is  and let's  do you have  examples of the  sarcasm  yeah that's  one of the  following paragraphs  alright let's go 
[03:37:00]  everyone's sarcastic  in one way or another  just to be funny  or just to mess around  with another person  do me a favor  could you put a little  less inflection into it  oh my goodness  sorry  and Jimmy  fine example  of sarcasm  right there  yeah I'm sorry  less inflection  okay  that was just  brilliant  it depends on  the situation  and what it's  supposed to be  used for  $50,000 isn't  anything is one  example of sarcasm  there are some  times in which  sarcasm is used  but you can't  really tell  the people that  can't really tell  the difference  are idiots 
[03:37:30]  oh now  is that a little  self-deprecating  humor  well there's more  than one people  like there's  some audience  people out there  there's more  than one people  you're right  there's some  audience members  out there that  still don't get  the sarcasm either  so I'm along  with the group  of people that  don't get it  calling them idiots  and then including  yourself in that  idiot  so you're king  of all idiots  no  hoo hoo  ripping them off  hoo hoo  go  the example  I said before  about Opie  saying to Jim  that $50,000  isn't really anything  was obvious sarcasm  but there were 
[03:38:00]  people that  thought  hold on  there's just a  goby desert  going on in his  mouth  do you hear that  crackling  it's like  Rice Krispies  in his dry  cotton mouth  the nerves  pasty white tongue  you sound like  everyone I smoked  pot with in high school  it's not like  there's a lot of  people listening  like I said  we're going to get  4 million subs  do you need some water  I think I'm cool  for now  they say that  that equals  about 12 million  listeners  give or take  very distracting 
[03:38:30]  3 people per sub  so it's about  12 million people  could be listening  to this  that's nothing  we used to talk  twice that  on a daily basis  so it's no big deal  go ahead  go ahead sweetie  where was I  oh  but there were  people that  thought he was  saying that  without a second  thought that it  just may be  sarcastic  it was made  obvious  in saying it  in such a way  that it was  obvious enough  for listeners  and enough times  for listeners  to pick up on it  and say  alright he doesn't  mean that  he doesn't mean  that to be serious  he's just 
[03:39:00]  messing with Jim  but it did not  come off that way  with a few people  do you know  you arguably  have the worst  idea conveying  ability of any  human being  I've ever met  I did kind of  write this drunk  so I just  no no  it's the wording  and it's the reading  like this  and you might as well  just say sarcasm  exclamation point sarcasm  Steve is really pissed  because Steve  go ahead  Diction  go ahead  go ahead  no you really  Jim hit the nail  on the head  you tried to give  an example of sarcasm  and you never even  the thought never 
[03:39:30]  was never clearly formed  you never actually  established what  Ope was talking  to Jim about  you never put this  example in any  kind of context  so you're just  assuming that  everybody has some  clue as to what  you're making  reference to  but you know  they don't  this paragraph  is awful  let's keep going  read it with a little  unthom  we're running out  of show here  let's go  for Pete's sake  thus leading over  to yell  it's called sarcasm  sarcasm is all about  hearing the tone  of how someone  says something  and that is sarcastic  another scenario 
[03:40:00]  was with my case  with Nathaniel  okay  he had a lot of  office chairs  surrounding him  he then said  that there weren't  enough chairs  around me  I need more  I need more chairs  Ricky passed me  that couch over there  me without thinking  obviously  actually moved  the chair over  without catching  sarcasm at all  did Nathaniel say  Ricky give me  that couch  move me that  couch over here  no  he did  no  alright  and Ricky  started moving  the couch over there  I like the way  too  it's really cool  because you always 
[03:40:30]  put the emphasis  on the right words  when you're reading  which makes it  really exciting  he said  Ricky  pass me  that couch  over there  me  without thinking  obviously  actually  move  the chair  alright go  Ricky  we're running  out of show  come on Ricky  that's an instance  where you must  always be awake  and order to  catch the  sarcasm  another case  of sarcasm  is callers  ending their  calls with  you guys  suck  they don't  mean that  at all  there are  times where  there isn't  sarcasm  at all  like when  Norton  told Dragon  Wagon  to cancel  his 
[03:41:00]  XM  sub  in front  of Eric  Logan  that wasn't  really sarcasm  but still  a great line  thanks  kid  attaboy  Rick  also not  sarcasm  is people  back in  the olden  days  saying  syndication  now  back in  the 1800s  yeah  the olden  days  syndication  now  he's trying  to get out  of the fact  that people  think he's  dumb  so he wrote  older and  people go  this kid's  worldly  syndication  now  I like  Ike  syndication  now is  in the  olden  days 
[03:41:30]  back when  they were  just in  NY for  two years  before actually  getting syndicated  to about  20 cities  and now  they're on  Exxon  covering  the whole  US  and Canada  in conclusion  sarcasm  is not being  serious  in what you  say  and saying  in such  a way  giving a  hint  holy fuck  what did I  write  wow  this is  awful  look at  this  conclusion  read that  again  in conclusion  sarcasm  let me read  it forward  forward  just to show  you guys  how much  of an  88  I am  that's  what you  were
