<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a jarring juxtaposition:  a song about Major Tom interspersed with chaotic chatter about money and a potential car fire.  The hosts then abruptly shifted to a discussion about childhood dioramas,  jokingly evolving into a listener contest for Opie and Anthony-themed dioramas and other elementary school projects like macaroni creations,  with one caller even suggesting a macaroni AK-47.  

The show then welcomed Dr. Michael Baden, a forensic pathologist, and a colleague (later identified as British coroner Peter Dean) for an extensive interview covering his career highlights, including autopsies of John F. Kennedy and Sid Vicious.  The discussion ranged widely across forensic pathology: challenges in determining cause of death, particularly in suffocation cases; the difficulties in prosecuting serial killers;  the limitations of forensic science as portrayed in media; the JFK assassination; TWA Flight 800; determining time of death; and anecdotes from Dr. Baden's career, often employing frank and darkly humorous language. They also discussed the surprisingly long preservation of bodies in extremely cold conditions, citing a 1930s plane crash victim as an example. A caller's question about cryogenics led to a comparison of U.S. and other countries' coroner systems, and Peter Dean shared experiences investigating deaths of British citizens abroad, particularly in Kenya, touching upon the Lockerbie bombing and the use of fat emboli to determine if victims were alive during the crash. The coroner's roles in investigating deaths, even those outside their jurisdiction, were explained, along with their professional relationship, including co-authoring books with Dr. Baden’s wife, and anecdotes about their experiences with passive-aggressive behavior during this process.  Famous cases like O.J. Simpson, Robert Blake, Klaus von Bülow, and Terri Schiavo were analyzed, highlighting forensic aspects and legal battles.  Dr. Baden’s involvement in the Phil Spector trial (under a gag order) and the Billy Martin death investigation were also mentioned.  The discussion included humorous anecdotes about unusual requests (exhuming Shakespeare, DNA testing of royal remains) and misconceptions (sewing up anuses in the morgue),  along with speculation about the nature of coroner parties. A caller's question about organ transplants prompted a discussion about organ allocation and ethical considerations.  Finally, Peter Dean shared his hobby of photographing tattoos on the deceased, noting regional and subcultural differences in styles.  A superfan, Sam, had a highly enthusiastic, albeit somewhat awkward, interview with Rob Zombie.

Following this, a segment on eco-guilt featured eco-therapist Melissa Pickett, interspersed with numerous interruptions from the hosts, callers, and a Pen & Teller bit.  Callers shared anxieties about their environmental impact, ranging from water usage to the carbon footprint of IEDs in Iraq, and one caller even described self-induced constipation due to eco-guilt.  A particularly contentious and highly offensive phone call with Maria dominated a portion of this segment, involving sexually charged exchanges with the hosts, primarily targeting Jimmy, with personal attacks and details about her family life, including a child with a disability.  The segment concluded with a discussion of the studio’s cockroach infestation and a pest control expert caller sharing anecdotes.

Subsequently, the show devolved into a series of bizarre and disgusting listener calls: a bird infestation in a gingerbread house, rat-killing stories, a cockroach emerging from a caller's anus, and more on the studio's cockroach infestation. This transitioned into a crude discussion about the definition of "gay" behavior, with explicit descriptions of sexual acts,  further fueled by Jim Jefferies' participation in the debate.  A live cockroach hunt in the studio, involving interns and culminating in one intern, "Cream Pie Jones," eating a cockroach on air, ensued.

The show continued with a rambling, sexually explicit discussion about masturbation and self-fellatio, involving Patrice O'Neal, and featuring a caller mentioning Ron Jeremy’s opinion on self-fellatio.  This was followed by graphic descriptions of a video depicting a man defecating on a strap-on during a sexual encounter with a prostitute. The hosts then brainstormed increasingly vulgar and sexually explicit ideas for a contest offering a listener a prom date with Anthony Cumia, generating increasingly offensive contest names.  Finally, the show played and mocked clips from *Quincy*, criticizing the acting and production values with offensive language, before concluding with an advertisement.

[00:04:00]  oh my god what's going on it's the worst of opie and anthony it's stupid something ridiculously  loud and obnoxious i've had like the best of down syndrome records we're never gonna make 
[00:04:30]  everybody happy so why do we have to now make more people not happy oh no it's stupid it's  audio vomit if i may use the word duty it's the worst of opie and anthony i didn't even know what  a diorama was until you just explained it yeah i knew it was a shoebox thing because we all  had to make them in school but i didn't realize it was called a diorama is it a diorama i would  yeah it sounds like it would be yeah you'd make like a little scene in a shoebox yeah and then 
[00:05:00]  you'd cut the um like part of the top off yeah and cover it with wax paper yeah wax paper and then  you'd cut a hole in the front and you pick it up and you put the uh open end of the shoebox that you  open and covered with wax paper uh under a light and then you look through the little hole and you  see the little scene that you made inside with little army men a little mirror for a lake you  know the kids that did real well making dioramas you know what they're doing today what working in  museums or doing radio i was i was very good at the diorama were you really oh yeah yeah i used to 
[00:05:30]  impress all the girls with my diorama you know the a little known fact about anthony i have some  diorama could i get some pepto-bismol you were a goody two-shoes growing up it's pretty obvious oh i was  you talk about looking in your microscopes as a kid and microscopes telescopes and yeah yeah i was a  little um fairy is what uh is what you would call them today i was a little fairy mary your dad ruined 
[00:06:00]  you man because you had the makings of being a brilliant scientist and he he thought you had the  makings of being a fag uh that was pretty much if you were a dear old dad uh kind of he thought i  was going to be a wussy if he would have let you be you probably would have done great things i may  have been uh an astronaut not that we're doing astronaut not that we're not doing great things  with this unbelievable radio show on a daily basis i look back with pride at what i did on that day 
[00:06:30]  i'm so proud people look at a guy like einstein whatever or they wonder what would happen if he  hadn't had like this nurturing as a child let's just say alcoholism had been involved  Einstein would have been a comic genius on the radio yeah yeah like instead of discovering exactly  discovered something yeah i i really do think uh there was a defined fork in the road of my life  sure and um i kind of took the the maybe a wrong turn it's it's funny because a lot of people wonder 
[00:07:00]  why we don't have flying cars like the jetsons the reason because anthony's dad thought he was a fag  and had to get rid of all his scientific yeah stuff yeah yeah everything kind of you know come on  big a man hey you're in man training you would tell me hey i don't know if there's a bit here  we're always thinking bits okay it's a lot of this stuff it falls by the wayside yeah which is  brought up a lot by ron and fez that we have a lot of things that never never develop oh really never 
[00:07:30]  go to the full stage ends in that that that stage that that pupa stage whatever the hell it's called  yes but then some of these things do take off like our animation festival will happen you're saying  we have a lot of bit abortions yeah i'm wondering if uh maybe some of the listeners could like develop  some of these dioramas or whatever a diorama based on the show that could be pretty funny  that would be based on anything to do with the show there's a picture of a diorama yeah that one's 
[00:08:00]  done differently though that one's up on its end yeah we should like the one you look through  yeah but i think the one up on the end is better for for our purposes yeah yeah then you'll see it  then you can put these up on the website uh-huh we we really should do that man we should have a  dumb little contest the best the best opian anthony diorama diorama we're giving you homework  the show's giving you homework we're your cool teacher you know we're the teacher that takes  you outside on a nice day to teach you outside under the tree and let you smoke pot behind the tree

[00:13:00]  the death ghoul no on this side of the show today very cool guest dr michael bodden yeah but he did  like five hbo specials uh the autopsy series and they're fascinating the autopsy uh autopsy series was  fantastic you can't not great you can't not enjoy watching a guy talk about death as knowledgeably  and comfortably jimmy yeah you think this michael uh bodden likes death i don't know i don't know 
[00:13:30]  yeah loves it loves death he really loves death there was always a great uh that show autopsy was always a  a good little mystery thing because they they'd have a case and uh he would tell how they solve it  through uh the autopsy and find out what what the dead could tell you it was a thing like the dead  can tell their story i love when he finds like a fingernail next thing you know he could tell  you it was a white male well yeah between the age of 35 and 37 perhaps round perhaps we could uh ask him 
[00:14:00]  about uh that case the uh one where they found i believe it was the tip of a finger yeah um in a  lake yeah where a man had put his wife through a wood chipper yeah uh yeah i bet you he can not  only tell you what happened but what she said to deserve it well should we bring him in he has a  friend with him who's i know absolutely hey roland can we bring uh bring the good doctor in what he's  traveling with another ghoul he has another coroner friend with him i don't know if they like to be  called ghost yes perhaps not the official oh i know that guy there you go hey i know you sir hey i know 
[00:14:30]  you got some you got some terrific eyebrows there  sunburn yeah serious american how you do things here on hate oh satellite yeah yeah he doesn't  understand they don't do that in england now we have a lot of terrestrial stuff a certain amount  of satellite but not satellite radios yeah it's like a oh yeah yeah they don't have it over there 
[00:15:00]  yeah you get to curse on this uh this medium well you know i'm here to learn yeah put the headphones  on there so you can hear everybody we get the headphones and uh yeah dr bodden make yourself  comfortable thank you dr bodden yes we've done about 12 now 12 uh hbo documentaries one a year  oh really well i thought it was five wow that's okay we you've been sleeping a little bit  yeah we were talking earlier how uh uh we enjoy uh the show the show autopsy was great uh watching 
[00:15:30]  your your specials and you are so you're so comfortable with the subject and it's what i do  i know the thing the thing is you're comfortable sitting here and i'm nervous yeah yeah but you know  something your line of work is a little more disturbing uh it depends how you look at it yeah  when i started out i started out as an internist at bellevue hospital intern resident  seeing people die and not being able to do anything to help that's really disturbing once they're 
[00:16:00]  dead then they're out of pain and suffering it isn't what's the worst that could happen you get  a pulse we've had that happen a few times really a guy goes to the morgue and sits up and says what  am i doing here is that real wow it does happens it happens uh because sometimes the the uh especially  in older people the pulse becomes so faint and the breathing becomes so faint that it's easily  overlooked and uh after a few hours they may come we had a few we've had a number of these in new 
[00:16:30]  york but they're all over in the states so do you need that male nurse for that angel of death guy you  know with the pillow it's with those guys dr bodden jesus that's that's the kind that we can't tell  that's the pillow yeah that seems to be like a really let's take that uh let's let's run with  that for a minute the old pillow over the nose thing when you suffocate somebody uh how do you  determine that somebody was was murdered or if they just died in their sleep oh we're on we're on 
[00:17:00]  oh yeah yeah make sure you say fuck a lot hey watch your language the thing about that is that we don't  like to give primers on how to kill people well i wouldn't uh yeah but i must say that suffocation  is the hardest uh diagnosis for medical examiner to make is it because whereas shootings and  stabbings and baseball bat injuries uh leave something to see at an autopsy if somebody suffocated  when the suffocating device the hands or the pillow take it off everything pops back to normal 
[00:17:30]  yeah so those are the hard it was easier when we had feather pillows because the feather pillows  would often break and they'd inhale the feathers oh so you can see when i first started out we had a  few people who had in here with feathers in their windpipe and lungs and we could say hey there's  something wrong with this he's been suffering yeah i guess attacked and murdered by a chicken  well how do they wait don't they tell care doesn't don't the teeth leave a print in the back of the 
[00:18:00]  in the back of your lip oh that you're pretty good at this sometimes it depends on the amount of force  used or if something is pushed in the mouth like uh we if a sock or something is pushed into the mouth  to assist in the suffocation it can leave uh injuries on the tongue and the inside but if it's one of the  things that happens with the sudden infant death cases with babies who don't struggle very much  um they can get wrapped up in uh in uh bedding or they can get wrapped up in plastic in the old days 
[00:18:30]  these were plastic to as a to prevent uh uh injuring the the um uh mattress when a kid urinates that's  great they uh they can get wrapped up uh it it can cause death and not leave any uh signs so uh those  are the things that we uh look at very carefully i just uh uh was watching um i like watching the a  many uh crime shows and they had a case where a man had uh he was suspected of killing his infant 
[00:19:00]  and they had it as sids and uh a few years prior he had uh another baby with another woman who who uh  died of sids and uh it turned out that um they convicted him of murder right well the thing there is  and the hbo specials you're talking about we've had a couple of those where the way one often identifies  suffocation of babies is it happens again and again right and that alerts uh alerts the um uh 
[00:19:30]  police and the investigators that uh this isn't just by chance uh so uh the ones that get caught are  the ones who usually have more than one what's the toughest one you've ever worked on where you had  to uh uh prove uh that somebody was murdered and there really wasn't much evidence but you pulled  it out well well part of the problem is when we investigate a case as medical examiners we're we're 
[00:20:00]  there not just to do something in prosecution we're there to do something for either side so our  investigation is was a crime committed now some of the tough ones are when we uh have a crime uh the  police think it's a crime we don't find any evidence of a crime we say so but i think the toughest one was  a serial murder in um in massachusetts where a nurse was thought to possibly be poisoning veterans 
[00:20:30]  by injecting various uh potassium into the uh intravenous lines this is about five or eight years ago  i hear that's very hard to detect and uh yes it is because as soon as we die the potassium starts  getting screwed up in the body the red cells break and all that and initially there'd been some  identification by um uh the toxicologist but he had his information on it was wrong he had a the wrong 
[00:21:00]  decimal point and the judge wouldn't um let him uh testify so we were able to make the identification  in court not by toxicology but by the electrocardiogram which with potassium shows uh certain abnormalities  that is when the codes were called they did an ekg and we went back we're able to find some of the  ekgs and able to establish the toxicology not by chemical analysis but by clinical symptoms 
[00:21:30]  and electrocardiogram that that's kind of tough the person get convicted yes she a female nurse  convicted and um uh it was in uh massachusetts which is a a non um death penalty state but this  was federal because it was in um in uh the federal uh va hospital right so i had to then testify  at a sentence at a uh sentencing hearing and the prosecutors the federal prosecutors going for the 
[00:22:00]  death penalty in massachusetts uh and the jury voted 11 to 1 for uh capital punishment but because  one person held out she's still she's jailed someplace in texas gotta be unanimous and she's  she's been in the news every now and then because she has had affairs with various prominent female  murderers oh really in in in the old prison prison all right so she's a good egg yeah  she's a fucking guller in jail how do you not like that so uh you've been even involved with some 
[00:22:30]  really high profile cases too i didn't even realize uh it said here's sid vicious's death yeah well that  was when i was uh the chief medical examiner in new york city and um sid vicious had been  arrested for stabbing nancy sponget at the chelsea hotel a wonderful hotel in east 23rd 20 west 23rd  street that uh a lot of famous writers had lived in and he was in jail for stabbing stabbing nancy 
[00:23:00]  sponget and uh he got bail out he came out and within a few days he was dead from a drug overdose  and when i went down to his mom was there collecting his things uh down greenwich village  someplace and he had a very high level of heroin because he had lost his tolerance while he was in  jail so he came out and shot up the same stuff oh wow and he died because he didn't wait to 
[00:23:30]  gradually develop the tolerance wow that'll happen yeah that and that's why often it's amazing it  doesn't happen more often because addicts there's no fda approval for what's in the little packets  and when in the old days when i started out in the 60s 70s when there was sort of organized crime  distribution of heroin there we'd analyze the packets and they had pretty much the same amount  of heroin in them then as more different groups came into it and there was disorganized distribution 
[00:24:00]  of heroin uh the amounts of heroin in a packet varied a great deal and if a kid  instead instead of taking the usual packets took one from a different uh supplier and had more  heroin he could die from an overdose so the overdoses increased wow wow yeah you were uh uh  what you were head of um the medical exam medical examiner's office in new york city and what year  was that because it was oh i was in the and sid vicious about 1978 79 so i was in the office for 
[00:24:30]  about 25 years jeez so uh you probably saw a lot coming through there huh oh we yes we had  uh we were up to 2 000 homicides a year yeah now it's down to uh about 500 or so yeah 2 000 a  year during the time you were in there or is that uh that was yeah that was and that wow that's a lot  of work yeah we got a lot more homicides than in england in england uh where they used to not have guns 
[00:25:00]  you know there was a lot less uh murders but they're great there's a lot more stabbings i think  a lot more yeah they're still angry they're just using different uh tools that's right but usually  see the thing is when you stab somebody usually you don't kill them you know a gunshot wound to the  head is pretty devastating or to the chest but stabbing you have a person is more likely to survive  unless one of those multiple just you know over anger well like uh you know oj will take that 
[00:25:30]  whole thing uh well see there you are again oj the the jury said he was not guilty of course they  did and you go along you probably even think lizzie borden was guilty well you know they made up a  little rhyme about her it has to be uh has to be true that it's pr even back then it was about  1890s lizzie borden took an axe gave her father her mother 40 whacks when she saw what she had done  she gave her father 41 yeah now the the hip-hop culture of that day that was a rap still live 
[00:26:00]  it's still lives with us and it obscures the fact that she was found that guilty that was some  gangster rap back then wow in england now what do you know that was excuse me that was in massachusetts  massachusetts yeah river what uh uh uh the the the oj thing uh um now obviously i i detect a tad bit  of sarcasm um what and i know it's ancient history at this point but what what do you think went wrong 
[00:26:30]  with that case i mean they had him well i think partly in the united states the uh government has  to prove its case and i think uh the general agreement even the people think that oj like uh  uh buglucia bugliosi who wrote a big thing about others who were violently uh thought that uh oj had  done it they all agreed that the prosecution failed to prove its case i think the criticism in large 
[00:27:00]  measure is the prosecution uh didn't present its case effectively you testified for i was surprised  because i was a fan uh i was surprised when you testified uh for the defense it actually made me kind  of question like well you know what what kind of evidence must they have then because they got dr  biden testifying what was what was the basis of them asking you to testify well i the basis there  were two bases which um and one has to be careful in in these cases we don't testify i don't testify as 
[00:27:30]  to guilt or innocence i testify as to certain points and with every medical exam that testifies in  in a case then like an oj there may have been 50 or 60 other people testifying uh who may have had  more impact on the jury but one of the things was that the the medical examiner testified from the  stab wound of the young man goldman's uh uh body that the person who did the um uh who did the stabbing  was right-handed about six feet tall and uh stabbed him uh from the front um and i says you can't tell 
[00:28:00]  that from an an unwitness stabbing it could have been a midget stabbing him who was left-handed  stabbing him from the back yeah i always thought that was a little odd on tv shows especially where  like he's obviously he was right-handed and you're like well he voted democrat look at the stab wounds  unless unless somebody sees the positions they're in facing each other or something um there's no hint  at to whether it's left-handed or right-handed and that was one of the issues that i testified it's it's 
[00:28:30]  that they it added in a lot of bad bad information with the good information they had a lot of good  information i think the dna evidence was really good except that it was presented it was presented  wonderful for a physician i'd love their five days of testimony on dna uh but somebody who just  graduated from high school isn't going to understand what they said that's one of the things that  we're very uh concerned about uh in testimony is how does the jury understand what we're saying 
[00:29:00]  right it's like you must have guests who'll come in they'll say wonderful things in phd terms that  are true but nobody understands right right except and i think that's partly what happened in oj also  so there's like a real there's a misconception testifying for the defense just means that they  called you to talk about a certain piece of medical evidence but it does get presented like  oh dr biden must have thought he was innocent because he was i agree i'm glad you said that  that doesn't at all mean that when i testify for the prosecution though because 99 90 percent of 
[00:29:30]  time i i work now with the new york state police i worked in new york city for 25 years we'd be  called by the prosecutor to testify sure i would hope that they got the right guy but the the thing  about it would be that the the testimony i give theoretically could be useful for either side  uh and um we have to be fair and now half the time in my when i'm asked to testify in private  i'll give an opinion and i won't be called to testify because my opinion doesn't agree with the 
[00:30:00]  um uh theory of the of the defense attorneys so when i get to testify it's because the the lawyers  think i'll be helpful but at the same time um you don't know the public doesn't know all the times  we don't testify because the because your opinion disagree wow see i'm glad uh yeah i was curious  i figured there was a reason for it but it's like you don't realize like oh they would call different  guys just to talk about one piece of the evidence yeah and uh yeah look at the prosecution is saying 
[00:30:30]  you can tell by stab wounds stuff about a guy you can't tell that's right you know all right well  they gotta bring in somebody to counter that what creeps you out like does any of this death stuff  creep you out ever yeah what would creep me out when i started and still is young kids and children  who are um innocents so much of what we do as medical examiners the victim is often um uh involved  in the death you know the the alcoholic who gets in a fight or the drug addict who gets killed by a 
[00:31:00]  pusher or in a family affair the the spouse who's been in a terrible marriage and fighting and all that  for years and one kills the other uh there's it's it's all sad but there's uh an understanding of  that when a parent or stranger kills a kid um uh who's perfectly innocent especially when i had kids  the same age it really was creepy even this creepy this kaylee case that's a kaylee anthony that's going 
[00:31:30]  on now right in florida um is this the guy who killed the little brother and and it's just i'm not  sure there's the mom there's the mom who's in jail and refused to say what happened to her yeah the  kid is three-year-old kid yeah that's really creepy because he has an innocent kid and obviously there  are things going on that uh um are upsetting can you think of one case though that was the most like i  guess it's hard when you look at say 10 different stranger children you can't pick which one but is  there one that stands out for you that was just the most enraging or the most upsetting well the only 
[00:32:00]  one i ever cried at i actually cried when i was asked to be ahead and head of pussy i'm kidding  it is is okay no no no no it's that it's sensitive i understand i had to  the the only one that i that i really tears came out was when i examined the candidate john f kennedy  autopsy for the select committee on assassinations that was established back in 1978 79 to review the 
[00:32:30]  deaths of john f kennedy and martin luther king and i looked at that autopsy in the photographs  and there was such a terrible kind of autopsy and photographs where there wasn't a proper cleaning of  the body and the proper attention paid you know to show our president who had been killed and to show  what i would consider not proper respect for the remains what really upset me apart from the fact 
[00:33:00]  that they got the uh the entrance and the exit uh and the trajectory wrong you know in our president  uh when when the that autopsy was done by hospital pathologists who uh never had any experience doing  gunshot wounds and one of the problems uh when i started out in the 60s 80 85 percent of murders in new york city  were uh solved now counterintuitively it's down to about 49 percent solved with all the new dna and all 
[00:33:30]  the new stuff and part and that's around the country and part of the problem from around the country that  the solve rate for murders has gone down so so much is because the people doing the autopsies are  hospital pathologists uh largely who uh do not know about gunshot wounds and stab wounds as with  president kennedy and that's still the situation in this country they're they're good um pathologists to  look into cancer and heart disease and natural disease that kill 92 percent of people but the eight 
[00:34:00]  percent of people accident suicide homicide that medical examiners deal with forensic pathologists  there are probably less than 400 pathologists in the country compared to 800 000 doctors  and most of the murders today 50 murders in the united states today will be done by uh the autopsy  will be done by pathologists who are not qualified 50 murders or 50 percent 50 murders about 50 murders  a day in the united states okay so sorry and uh hospital pathologists do the autopsies who are not trained in 
[00:34:30]  forensics and that's one of the reasons that even with the better forensics we have the people doing the  autopsies aren't as with john f kennedy was he uh shot from the front or the back you think he was  shot twice and only twice from the back and one missed the first one misses second one um hits a him in the  uh back and goes into john f kennedy  uh connelly governor connelly says he hears a shot and starts turning around that shot he thinks hit the president 
[00:35:00]  but it missed it hit the curb  when the second shot comes in he's partially turned  to look at what happened and that's why that uh gunshot wound is thought to be  curves around oh because he's turned around he's turned in a straight line uh through his back  into his left thigh and they're assuming he's sitting there straight but he's not which he wasn't  and then the the third and he might have survived that one but the third shot  um is uh the one that kills him that's in the line of fire with the oh yeah yeah movie about that 
[00:35:30]  also about the uh these i know the house select commission commission on assassination 78 they  they actually said that they're i guess through acoustics they did acoustic tests they thought  that there might have been a fourth ball and they said that they think there definitely was but now  they're going back on that that's a very good question and the reason it's a good question goes back  our forensic pathology panel concluded two and only two shots from behind from where oswald was  but there are other experts just like in every trial just like with oj and the experts in the 
[00:36:00]  acoustical trial said there was a fourth shot which i which there's no evidence from the autopsy  so they concluded that it was a conspiracy because the fourth shot would have been too close to the  third shot to have to reload it was like a second apart wasn't it a uh they said  it was a policeman's motorcycle audio that had been left on and now but then they said later  maybe it was the wrong mic that they had thought so what they were hearing was actually a noise from 
[00:36:30]  somewhere else and not part of the assassination yeah that that that's right and the policeman whose  car it was whose motorcycle was with the mic that presumably was open that they heard the fourth shot  he he denied that it was his that it was his uh radio that was on he just has consistently denied it  and um i think that the noise i've listened to that uh just a lot of static yeah you guys would  probably have heard it because there was a nice little professor from queen's college who said it  was a fourth shot but there's no evidence no other evidence no evidence in the body no evidence 
[00:37:00]  so you have no dad oswald did this huh that's correct no no question is his fingerprint his  handprint is on the weapon he purchased the weapon under a false name no no and the trajectory lines up  to where uh the um if you assume that uh connelly is sitting slight turning slightly to to look at  because he was a hunter and he heard the first shot and he recognized it as a shot which didn't hit 
[00:37:30]  anybody except you can see on one of the zapruder films where it struck the curb and then the second  shot hits the president and connelly and there was also jfk too it's funny it was was on a seat that  was raised a little bit and it was more towards the middle where all the old diagrams like they  showed connelly facing forward kennedy but kennedy was to connelly's left i believe a little bit so  the trajectory does line up a little bit better yeah and he was he was they said that he was kind of uh  slumped down which is why the suit jacket was raised all these things that the  the the thing about it is that uh the connelly was on a jump seat in front so it was lowered down 
[00:38:00]  and to the left a little bit to to the left of uh kennedy sitting behind him you know jump and that if  you take it all into account it's clear uh and we concluded almost unanimously uh that um uh that  bullet that the second bullet that um oswald shot struck kennedy in the back went through his chest 
[00:38:30]  uh went through his neck sorry and into and to connelly's chest and into his thigh wow that's the  so-called magic bullet the whole uh autopsy thing uh where it was so you know uh dirty and uh it seemed  like it wasn't uh well like was that just business as usual back then or yes that was business  except it was the one thing and this is uh one of the things that hospital when hospital pathologists  do work and do autopsy and people die cancer and heart disease people evaporate upon they'll have 
[00:39:00]  the chairman of the surgery department and the residents and interns there to to learn from it  to give information about how the what went wrong in the operation for example here when the president  is killed you can't when medical examiners do autopsies you can't have interested people in the  autopsy room the autopsy room belongs to the pathologist in charge of doing the autopsy and  what was happening in in um the kennedy autopsy is that there were admirals and cabinet members 
[00:39:30]  in the autopsy room who shouldn't have been there and giving him orders and we asked him  i interviewed uh dr humes who in washington we would interviewed him i said had you ever done an  autopsy on a gunshot victim before no uh did you tell this to the to the uh people asked you to do  the autopsy you should get a medical examiner not a hospital pathologist and he said look when all  these generals and admirals are there we don't say anything wow they tell us to do something we do it 
[00:40:00]  wasn't he military too doctor wasn't he military and kind of more subject to orders than somebody else  yes he was a commander wow yeah yeah and and uh he was stationed at the hospital and he just so  happened they took the body illegally from dallas where they had an excellent forensic pathologist  who'd done hundreds of gunshot wound and rifle wound uh autopsies and brought it up to uh illegally to 
[00:40:30]  because it was at that time a state crime uh to uh washington dc where the doctors who did the  autopsy had no experience doing the uh gunshot wound cases why'd they do that did they ever say  why they did that they say they did it because the secret service felt that this might be a conspiracy  and they'll be after jackie kennedy they're going to shoot other people we had to get the and there  was a confrontation the medical examiner in um in um dallas said stood at the um emergency room door in  the hospital and said you can't take the body out of here this is a state of texas dallas county 
[00:41:00]  case it's illegal to move the body and the secret service there and they and they had the dallas  police in the in the um emergency room had a brief confrontation and there was a concern of some  people that they were going to draw guns and start shooting but uh even though uh there was this  objection the decision was made to overrule the uh medical examiner in dallas and to move the body  down to uh washington which was a big mistake and i think a lot of the there'd always be uh questions 
[00:41:30]  but a lot of the questions that have risen about uh autopsy uh misfindings because the autopsy report  has a lot of incorrect information um would have been avoided if a proper forensic pathologist had  done the autopsy as was present in dallas what about the brain they lost his brain is that true yeah  yeah the brain see one of the things that medical examiners have to do is look at the brain gunshot 
[00:42:00]  wounded the brain so instead of examining the brain right away dr yumes put it in formaldehyde  to test it to examine it you know a few weeks after it was hardened and then it disappeared  wow in my further investigations later on it sounded what i was able to include was of course we  interviewed lot lots of people about where's the brain you know and um uh we were able to determine  uh and we interviewed the the um gravediggers that anybody come and put the brain in it's like old 
[00:42:30]  catholic and old jewish tradition is when the body is buried it should be all the pieces should be put  in so god can fix it uh and um what happened here is that the um gravedigger said nobody ever came  but then we found out that there was a midnight vigil when the body was removed from the temporary  uh grave to the eternal light where it is now it is now around midnight where a number of people 
[00:43:00]  including bobby kennedy came no gravediggers were there and he put the material into the cast  near next to the casket and that's where the brain probably is next to the casket in uh arlington  cemetery and wait so they would never allow the body to be exhumed right is that what it was well  that would have been an issue see we considered that and i had to discuss uh with other people  there whether we should ask for the body to be exhumed which the family wouldn't have uh wanted they 
[00:43:30]  they made it clear they didn't want uh exhumation and there was an issue what if we want thought it  was necessary they go to court and we decided independently that look um if the family doesn't  want it and since we have all the information we need to explain the bullet trajectories and the  cause of death that we shouldn't press for it and we didn't press for an exhumation  should see if the uh eric nagel brain is uh also deep in that grave  it's one of our employees yes he's hoping you could do an autopsy 
[00:44:00]  yeah he's been found we're getting at x-ray show he just has a stem  it's amazing there's nothing after the stem and he still functions and walks around we think it's all  motor reflexes as they say they think that lawyers work like that too why don't we uh  dr uh quincy douchebag oh no quincy quincy was very good uh except what quincy shows what the  what the problems are with csi and all that is that um you can't just let a case develop normally  because too boring you got to have the csi person do the dna in three minutes or else you don't have 
[00:44:30]  a show and that show yeah so uh there's a lot of information giving these programs that isn't quite  true like quincy well quincy it seemed quincy was always out there and and people were shooting  at quincy sometimes yeah that that's the kind of doesn't happen with quincy and the csi the one  person does everything yeah he does the autopsy goes to the scene he interviews people all which  doesn't happen a young girl was murdered doctor i disagree you sit around i go out and find who did 
[00:45:00]  it yeah very good very very good but the thing about it is i think the public this is the problem  i have with the quincy and other shows yeah the public um um realizes at some level that this is  all video uh license you know that they're allowed to do things that aren't real one person doesn't do  six different jobs in real life they realize that what they don't realize is that all cases don't get 
[00:45:30]  solved the the thing about oj simpson how come only oj simpson uh uh you know he's the only  high profile cases in hollywood don't get solved uh more than half the murders in the united states  don't get solved see uh more i i don't think anybody's studies 40 30 percent of people who commit  murders wind up getting convicted well in la it's probably gonna be 10 percent with their horrendous  prosecution did they blow the menendez they blow they blew oj they blew a lot of big cases right 
[00:46:00]  well maybe if they were doing a case they don't they don't not everybody gets convicted  look at louisiana in new orleans where they got what a two percent uh uh solve rate for murders you  know wow since katrina two percent yeah they're less than two percent i think i think there's one  murder conviction in new orleans partly i think because they're very weak sweeping up a very weak  district attorney's office oh yeah how did you catch the one guy how bad was the one guy who  kept confessing let's take a quick break and continue okay hi this is jimmy smithson you're 
[00:46:30]  listening to the worst of opium anthony we're back with the opium anthony show dr michael bawden  in studio the the famous uh pathologist and uh i want to ask uh what made you want to go into this  field most people wouldn't it just by accident because uh since birth my mother had wanted me  to be a doctor and i wound up uh going to city college new york and nyu medical school and just 
[00:47:00]  but to be a real doctor to treat living people you know um and when i got to nyu medical school  at that time the autopsy room was at bellevue hospital together with the medical examiner's  office so when i went down to look at uh organs from dead people um there were the medical examiners  in the corner with all the interesting cases and i just got interested by chance because  the the medical examiner's office in the bellevue pathology department uh shared the same autopsy 
[00:47:30]  room were you creeped out by the first dead body you saw oh yeah i was creeped out it's interesting i  was creeped out for a couple reasons one the odor of death and two that some of the medical examiners  were drinking coffee and eating sandwiches i was gonna ask you about that smoking yeah they'd smoke  while they're doing the autopsy in those days just chatting somebody who died of lung cancer you know  smoking a cigarette and they drink coffee and i said that's horrible and that really creeped me out 
[00:48:00]  but after about a week of going to the autopsy room no more odors because i guess it knocked out  all my smell uh things and i started drinking coffee in the autopsy room i got a i got an idea are you  are you a fun guy you like to have a little fun well uh as long as we don't get sued for it well we  have a guy that has horrific breath and i'm just wondering if uh if it's worse than death if it's  worse worse than death right well there's a the autopsy room has a very unique kind of smell because 
[00:48:30]  you're smelling gases coming out of the intestines of people who are all right autopsy plus there's a  background of formaldehyde of course you use formaldehyde in the autopsy room to put organ  tissues to look at them under the microscope so this is a very unusual kind of smell it's a little  different than just the odor of a dead body like walking by right right some dead animal on the side  of the dead animal and the dead human pretty much smells similar yeah that smell is uh oh should we 
[00:49:00]  bring in iraq i really want to do this i kind of want to tell if it's worse than death he's in a bad  mood today though do you put anything under your nose like uh like silence of the lambs yeah no it's  the most amazing thing up until a silence of the lambs nobody used mixed vapor except occasional  policemen but then when uh jodie foster used it under her nose it was life imitating art you know 
[00:49:30]  everyone started everybody uses now vix i think the vix vapor rug is a more horrific smell than the  natural smells of a dead body death i have a feeling he gets in there and gives a nice yeah  i'm at work that's that's natural smells and what about the uh the uh gallows humor that you see  sometimes in movies and stuff do the guys around sometimes you got a case that isn't particularly  you know i don't know it's awful but some people you do feel a little more sympathetic than others 
[00:50:00]  and maybe you joke about an injury that's the problem with when when cases get videoed and sound  is on sometimes one does um uh second autopsies from for uh murder cases and the defense wants their  video and they have a second um uh autopsy done and they have the sound on and you can hear things  in the background and there is sometimes to relieve the tension sure people tell jokes and things and i 
[00:50:30]  don't like that at all and i'm doing an autopsy because it can be misinterpreted as disrespect for  the body which it really isn't of the dead person uh but the classic um um uh gallows humor  that i when i came in uh there was an old uh very distinguished uh first chief medical examiner  in new york city uh nars and he was professorial and huge and he was dictating a case to to um a um 
[00:51:00]  stenographer that was before uh uh what do you call it uh the laptops and stuff like that this is back  in the 30s in the 20s and at the end of the dictation the stenographer says hey you didn't mention  anything about his penis i said what about it well the penis it goes all the way over his leg down  to the table uh isn't that unusual and uh the stenographer the stenographer uh says you didn't  mention that and he says well why i i have one like that and he uh stenographer says you have one as 
[00:51:30]  long he says no one just is dead that that's that's the kind of uh gallows uh humor that uh is uh not meant to be  disrespectful right right body farms i read a book called uh stiff that was amazing it was yes it was  i wrote marion roach it was a book about uh the dead and what they do with uh the bodies and how they  they test them for all sorts of things and how useful bodies can be after death and helping the 
[00:52:00]  community helping they actually try doctors cosmetics on uh dead people and stuff like that  cosmetics and they have different uh surgeons ent head surgeons and neurosurgeons and abdominal  practice on dead bodies or do anatomy and do dissections and it's wonderful with permission  from the next of kin they put them in car crashes yes that uh wow pope doesn't like that even with  permission the pope came out with where they run cars into bodies with permission that are hanging 
[00:52:30]  down from the ceiling who the hell has that job wow in uh in i had a friend of mine down in baltimore  the medical examiner there would shoot dead bodies and and run into dead bodies and then write the  papers publish the research so that the car companies could learn from it and the people made um  uh vest bulletproof vests can learn from which bullets really go through and which don't  and a lot can be useful but it has to be done very carefully with permission of uh the next of kin 
[00:53:00]  yeah and the pope doesn't like this why would he yeah the the i remember at the time uh a few years  ago the pope came out and said that uh even with commission you're not allowed to run into dead bodies  they can't run into a lot of that in germany the german pathologist well they of course they were  but the best those guys only a certain group i'm sure the best part of the book was uh how they  were describing these body farms yeah that one of the things that uh that's the gold standard the  golden um um that that the people that medical examiners are looking for is how do you tell time 
[00:53:30]  of death how do how do you know when somebody's died and one of the ways that's been worked on is in  the body farm is to see what happens to the body after death how long it takes to decompose  can you tell from the maggots and flies that come into the body how long they've been dead and  they've been doing a lot of research dr bass was the founder of this down in um uh tennessee  university tennessee anthropology uh school and uh they've learned a lot about um how bodies 
[00:54:00]  go from ashes to ashes dust to dust this is god's way of recycling a body uh a lot of it with bacteria  and with um maggots and insects that um break the body down but they put these uh bodies in all  sorts of scenarios in this body uh farm yes like uh i don't know stuffed in a trunk or a drowning  victim or yes in all different ways and there's only one and they study how the body does in these 
[00:54:30]  situations and how long it takes to decompose so if you find a body you can tell you're dead for  three months or three years right and the problem with that though is that how fast the body decomposes  is so temperature and climate dependent it's all dependent the higher the temperature the faster  it breaks down and what good what works in tennessee doesn't necessarily work in new york or in alaska so  that there is uh the that we're still searching for the holy grail of how to tell how long somebody's 
[00:55:00]  been dead do you find uh like uh you look where the the mummies were done it's pretty impressive  the way the egyptians took care of the dead right yes it's it's very impressive and it's even more  impressive how god takes care of the dead remember the 5 000 year old oh yeah that was found in the  austrian alps was an excellent condition because cold freezing prevents the bacteria from starting  when we die the first things that happen to uh start breaking this down is the all of the 
[00:55:30]  bacteria in our intestines start spreading through the body and the bacteria eat up things and create  gases and if it's below um 33 degrees or 34 degrees fahrenheit the bacteria can't work and bodies will  stay uh like mammoths and will will stay forever in ice what about um oh god what what is how do flies  no they smell they smell they smell the dead but and it's not you're right and in fact when somebody's 
[00:56:00]  unconscious the flies will start coming in even before the body the person is dead if unconscious  we'll see bodies uh in hospitals where the person just dies by the time they're down into the uh more in  their refrigerator uh flies it's amazing during season how many pregnant flies there are they'll run  around and they'll lay their eggs in any kind of moist surface but where do they come from all of a  sudden yeah well lewis pasteur i think found out that flies come from other flies and not from the 
[00:56:30]  and what happens is that uh during summer during spring uh there are lots and lots of uh pregnant  flies that have these maggot eggs in them and they'll go wherever they can smell that there's a moisture  and in using the nostrils and the nose in the first place or in in holes in the body like bullet  holes and stab wounds they'll lay their eggs there we have to be very careful about the distortion that 
[00:57:00]  can cause oh yeah how about not sleeping people if you're drunk and passed out will fly actually  crawl in your nose and lay eggs you know maggots not usually i've had i've had cockroaches in in the  bronx when babies and alcoholics who fall down have uh crawl into the ear or crawl into the nostril  and really cause a lot of pain but cockroaches don't eat they don't bite people don't know that  cockroaches don't bite and they don't remove tissue but they can cause a lot of pain in the ear by 
[00:57:30]  scratching the eardrum that's that's pretty nasty stuff how do you get one of those out you just  gotta go with a couple of tweezers you know you well you actually you put water in and you irrigate  the uh with a little plunger and you wash it out you wash that comes out like it's on a water slide  did you do uh belushi's autopsy um i didn't do the autopsy but i reviewed it and i testified in the  grand jury and the trial no i saw the photographs he was in uh l.a right uh yeah he died in uh 
[00:58:00]  maramond hotel right in the maramond hotel in los angeles and it turned out with a lot of heroin  and um cocaine in his body and they've the district prosecutor called me to come in the case because  i'd done it written a lot of papers about heroin and cocaine from new york city and it looked like  he had been on a cocaine high and the heroin was given by the girlfriend uh not the girlfriend but the  gal who whom he paid to make the injections um uh in order to bring him down from the high it wasn't 
[00:58:30]  really a cannonball you know kind of it was the heroin used to counteract the cocaine that's what  killed him and um i had an interview with his doctors and all that he hated needles and um  uh that's why he hired a person to inject the cocaine and there were a number of um of people  there de niro and um robin williams robin williams were with him the night before and uh they uh 
[00:59:00]  testified in the grand jury in the same time i testified that um he didn't like um uh needles that's  why he paid katherine smith i think it was to do the injections and she was the one who was brought  up on the charges that even though he asked her to do it that's not excuse was she convicted yeah  she she had gone to canada and i had to testify send testimony to canada get her extradited back to 
[00:59:30]  to los angeles and then she was convicted and she had to spend uh a manslaughter or something and she  spent about 10 years in jail or something she did 10 years for that i'm not sure she may have gotten  10 years and spent five years wow but she's back in canada as i last i heard what was uh your  greatest case well i think the the one that was most important to me was the uh john f kennedy case  and i think we got it all right because it's still a controversy after 15 oh yeah always yeah all right  you want top seed interesting one of the uh one of the with the flight 800 twa flight 100 yeah it's 
[01:00:00]  everybody's nightmare um because you know i i correct me if i'm wrong by this the plane it goes up  13 000 feet explosion blows off the cockpit first yeah and the uh plane continued to ascend for i  think another 3 000 or 4 000 feet something like that yeah uh because the wing engines uh were  unaffected yeah and the weight difference now you tip the nose up because the right up cockpit's gone  and they were alive when they hit the ground when they hit the water yeah i i don't remember where 
[01:00:30]  i heard that obviously i'm gonna guess it was some kind of an impact death but wasn't it drowning  or did they say that they technically drowning um yeah the the the problem is when you hit water  like that it's like hitting concrete really and they had a lot of injuries although a few people  had inhaled water which would make it drowning but they probably were unconscious and had severe  injuries at the time uh so even once we're dead brain dead we can still be breathing uh for 
[01:01:00]  a little bit and when you inhale water that's technically drowning okay but i the question  about the cases that have me the biggest concern the two groups of cases that is one is when i get  involved with people who i think are really innocent they're innocent people that get convicted on bed  medical examiner work those are the cases that are most disturbing because people are in jail for  15 20 years and you find out that it wasn't a murder at all that they made a mistake and  the eyewitnesses were wrong and stuff like that and they get out and the prosecutor says well 
[01:01:30]  it shows you the system works because the guy gets out here for 15 years well and the the other case  that's most difficult for medical examiners around the country deaths during police restraint they're  the ones that the hardest because invariably there are people saying that uh he died because  he had uh he got too excited and he died and the and the um uh friends who are the uh in the witnesses  from uh the non-police witnesses say no he was saying i can't breathe i can't breathe but they still 
[01:02:00]  were sitting on him and he couldn't breathe and he died of not breathing those are the cases that become  the most difficult and i think the most important for us to solve correctly because uh once we start  trying to uh make sure the police don't get blamed as often happens is we're really becoming partial  rather than impartial scientists where's where was there just to go back to flight 800 for a minute  were there any people uh that had burn uh injuries on them that would have been sustained before they 
[01:02:30]  died from from being in a place with an open the open wound to the front of the plane a lot that was  very confusing at first when we went up to see there were about 230 people on the flight including  everybody all who died of whom died the first hundred were floating the other 130 were were not  and it was exact number 100 came out and they had a lot of skull burns on their body which was very 
[01:03:00]  puzzling at first but later turned out to be because they've been lying in the jet fuel they had the full  jet uh fuel tanks yeah and the jet fuel is very irritating to the skin even after death so there  were a lot of burns on the exposed portion of the bodies not on the clothed portions but they all  happened after the death while they were floating before they were brought in uh to to the morgue did  any of them live maybe there's no way to tell but maybe you know something about what happens to the 
[01:03:30]  body did any of them live all the way down or or will your brain uh because the pressure not work  no when somebody's falling out down you you you don't lose consciousness usually people jump off  the empire state building they get in trouble when they land they're still conscious uh here uh we had  evidence of some people breathing in water and um and bleeding into their lungs and all which would  indicate in my opinion there was some dispute about this in the uh um insurance claims because in the 
[01:04:00]  civil litigation the longer somebody's alive theoretically the more money the family's going  to get but the in the important thing is not living it's consciousness so i think that after the  explosion there were most of the um uh people who died lived long enough to get into the water  and then breathed a bit and uh had injuries internal bleeding to indicate they were still alive in  the heart was pumping but it's a bigger issue to say how long were they conscious my experience 
[01:04:30]  with people who have fallen and survive you know in stories that they tell afterwards who jumped out  of building and then survived is that yeah they knew when they were hitting the ground so i think that  that many of them would have been conscious and you'd have that much conscious pain and suffering  a few seconds which could mean a lot uh in a civil action  oh sure but falling 13 000 feet i just wasn't sure if the cabin pressure i mean i was always  kid cabin pressure was gone because of the pole i just wondered if that type of fall but i guess 
[01:05:00]  people skydive is not that bad people skydive it's not like they're 35 yeah yeah and and also the  skydivers know the interesting about falling objects bodies even with the astronauts who fell  you know hundreds of thousand feet a miles up um the terminal velocity only goes to about 120 miles  uh an hour on impact because of the atmosphere that prevents that whole thing up and that's why 
[01:05:30]  in the astronaut deaths the uh the bodies were in good enough condition to identify all the  astronauts they don't they don't uh smash into smithereens as was said in the world trade center  you know 40 percent of the world trade center bodies were never identified partly because no autopsies  were done on those that remained but the excuse given was that they smashed into smithereens or  something bodies don't smash into smithereens they say remark the skin stays intact even though  there's a lot of uh internal yeah your guts may shoot out your ass in your mouth right but i mean uh 
[01:06:00]  they said that's what happens if you jump naked somebody jumped naked i think on the empire state  building it was like a real passive aggressive thing like i jumped nude and then it's just to  give his body the fucking all the guts and blood to blow that can happen jeez how do you know these  things i just i masturbate a lot jimmy's a morbid morbid guy you know if you take this and give this  the fbi behavioral unit i think they may think we have a serial killer they're not the only ones  he studies uh serial killers but i read about stuff like that i say he studies it myself but he says 
[01:06:30]  he reads about it it's a little hobby but he knows more about serial oh yeah knows all their names and  everything yeah it's unbelievable but yeah it was interesting to uh i see i was under the illusion  that those flighted hundred people had probably passed out before hitting the ground but term of a  i guess it's it's it's amazing the the how the body stays intact and uh in my because nobody's  ever done a study on this you know uh having a person talking to a microphone while he's falling 
[01:07:00]  down but uh i think the evidence is that uh most people falling from heights uh such as the empire  state building and even airplanes are a lot are still conscious when they hit the ground even at pan am  that explosion of a lock and be which is a full 30 something thousand feet when they they dropped  right yeah there was another there was one about 10 000 when i first started out as a medical student  with two airplanes crashed over um brooklyn and a kid survived who fell into a snow bank it was during 
[01:07:30]  the winter and he was able to remember things that happened on the way down but then he died oh wow it  was about 10 000 feet up i think he survived the ending he survived for yeah right he survived for a few  weeks but then he died he had enough injuries what's uh the baby mummification case about someone  wants us to ask you about baby mummification ask about the baby mummification case no i'm not quite  clear that although babies uh can mummify after they're dead we've had some situations where babies 
[01:08:00]  the parents don't tell anybody the baby died and over time in war in in warm climates what's interesting  on the desert and then when we die there the bacteria from the gut starts going in to decompose  the body and bloat it up but also there's a drying out in hot climate hot climate so if the drying is  faster than the ability of the of the bacteria develop the bacteria need water to to develop fluid 
[01:08:30]  if they dry out very quickly the body has a leather a leathery mummification  and can stay for hundreds of years in that condition wow yeah they just recently found like  i i think the hand of a passenger from a plane that crashed in the 30s and they were able to  identify this guy was it something yeah by fingerprints by fingerprints and uh dna yeah yeah it's amazing now  story they were able to develop some fingerprints from um it was a a merchant marine in an airplane 
[01:09:00]  yeah and it crashed in the mountain in canada and it was because it was in this cold after  60 70 years they're still able to get a fingerprint fingerprint off his hand it's the most amazing  thing yeah absolutely yeah it was something just read that one all right uh let's say how to brian  in kentucky brian oh hey let me show up um i'm pretty raw i hope i don't get cut off i wonder  what the doctor thinks of that cryogenics is that just bullshit or is that a legitimate science or 
[01:09:30]  what's his opinion uh it's bullshit but but it but it's interesting and you it's interesting  kentucky has a great medical examiner system in different states that half the united states is still  the old coroner system which we inherited from england in colonial days in which any citizen can get  elected uh coroner as long as he's uh voting age kentucky has a very excellent medical examiner system 
[01:10:00]  uh it's interesting also that the coroners in the united states are entirely different than  coroners in england and canada because they upgraded the coroners so coroners today have to be  doctors or lawyers or very well trained in england and canada and australia but united states coroners  still are the way they were in the uh eight uh what is it uh 1660s so you can just wow a bunch of 
[01:10:30]  ups drivers just become one yeah just become one what does what does he do over there with the  eyebrows he's a coroner we have peter dean has been visiting me he's a coroner in england is he  famous or something he's famous over there he goes to africa and he finds out where english people  have been killed in africa and they cover it up it was that in kenya really in kenya absolutely  fascinating yeah it's been really interesting actually listening to the discussion and particularly  when you're talking about airplane incidents as well i mean certainly after lockerby that was one 
[01:11:00]  of the big issues as to whether people were alive for the fall itself and what they actually looked  at was little things called fat emboli in the bodies when they were recovered and found that maybe  70 percent of them had these little fat emboli which suggested that they still had active circulations  and therefore were still alive during the fall itself yeah that's interesting as peter says  because our bones have fat in the bone marrow and if you're alive and the bones break some of that 
[01:11:30]  fat gets into the bloodstream and the heart has to be pumping all right to get pumped around so that's  good evidence that they were alive it still doesn't tell you if they were conscious right right but  tells you they were alive so you now what why are people being murdered in kenya from britain what  happens is with the system that we have in the united kingdom if a body comes back from abroad to your  jurisdiction if it was an unnatural death you still have to investigate that death so english corridors  get involved therefore in investigating deaths that actually happened abroad as long as the body comes 
[01:12:00]  back to your area you still have responsibility for investigating the circumstances how are they  being killed um a variety of means really not all not all criminal cases a lot of them may be a natural  death for other reasons accidents abroad like diana and dody indeed yeah they were killed in uh  they died in paris in an auto accident yet the coroners in england did autopsies yep and you get to see  those bodies no i was not involved in that hey don't look at me he's like he's saying like hey 
[01:12:30]  absolutely no it's interesting to watch the whole thing develop but again it's an example of just how  if the body is killed in some incident abroad criminal or otherwise it still becomes the subject  of an english coroner's inquest if the body comes back what are you two you two guys just like coroners  hang out together so yeah yes you guys do and just talk about people we learn about it i learned  about how people die in england from peter and he learns about and all that's in new york by just 
[01:13:00]  walking the streets it's fascinating when you come to things like the american academy of forensic  sciences the range of expertise you guys have that's where you go to the same kind of conferences  and for forensic scientists from around the world peter could you say uh wasabi please  was subbing i would uh you said you're going back on the um uh on uh what was it queen mary too  to give a seminar what kind of fun cruise is this they always have a range of lecturers on board they 
[01:13:30]  have general interest lectures sometimes there'll be um lectures themed to destinations now this one's a  transatlantic cruise and they have different lecturers on board so i'm just going to be talking  about kind of legal history i don't know i kind of like rum drinks and feeling hot hot hot and  listening to uh caters for all tastes i mean peter once gave a lecture on the titanic and then they 
[01:14:00]  forbid him to do that yeah no more no more cruises for you hey you want to play shuffleboard or go  listen to the coroner talk about it's a little unusual the first time i did one they had a british  comedian on board in fact and he said uh first night he's doing a show in one of the areas and he was so  bad they mixed you two up he's going down the list of people on board and says it says here they've  got a coroner on board must be a miss british it must be a crooner i said for the rest of the crews  i think they just thought there was some crooner you're the crooner but it's interesting to have 
[01:14:30]  different lectures you know michael and i think we did a there's a halloween murder mystery crossing  once it was very fascinating they themed the whole they take it a little far though and actually do an  autopsy on the poor person these two would be a ball at a keg party i was just gonna say  you guys have you guys are either really fun or you have the worst parties like it's a bunch of  people with black coffee and black balloons and the shades are all drawn they're just maniacs and  they let loose and have a good time well like what do you talk about like you're a married guy we say 
[01:15:00]  keep drinking and smoking because it's good for business what do you talk about in like in your  personal life i can't picture dr bonden and his wife just discussing music or what do you want them to  eat it just my wife is a former prosecutor in new jersey and um and now does uh civil work uh and we  we talk we're writing books now about um uh now we have a series going now the first one was uh  remain silent the next coming out in january skeleton justice about uh a male medical examiner a female 
[01:15:30]  prosecutor and how they get into twangled with intertangled with each other and have disputes  and non-disputes they're not married yet eventually i think in book four they'll get married  are there little passive aggressive things about the relationship kind of coming out  absolutely oh absolutely it's it's i hadn't appreciated how possessive my wife was of her  words i'll change words and she'll get very angry with it and that's brought out it's amazing we're 
[01:16:00]  still married like do you how do you change the words do you do you make it better or does she think  that you're dumbing it down like she'll write something really eloquent and you'll just kind  of put like the man fell that reads better well i think it's just the opposite i try to put into  shakespeare i put into iambic pentameter punch it up with it and to try and you know make it more  literary and uh she may think that misses the point she yell you yeah yeah from time to time like a 
[01:16:30]  prosecutor she doesn't yell at me when peter's around though she's very good when company's around  but if she wants to ask questions about that like you just will she sit you down like you know  you're in trouble when she'll start like michael uh and then you start kind of going over  she starts saying what about this hair that was uh on your shirt let's discuss a hair and how much  evidence it potentially has oh that's got to be great though you can do everything about science  you could probably just cheat and explain everything away let me tell you something that which i have 
[01:17:00]  learned a good cross examiner can do very well no matter even if she doesn't know anything about  science she knows the kind of questions to ask trip you up cross examination is is a um is a art as  an art in itself what about dennis was it dennis fong was his name i think right the uh dr barry  sheck uh it was very interesting because people remember that with the oj simpson where barry  sheck was able to uh have the criminalist dennis fong uh who worked for the los angeles crime 
[01:17:30]  department admit understand that he had made some mistakes right his analysis uh and in his uh  protection of the evidence but i thought the most the most uh spectacular thing was peter neufeld who  works with him cross-examining those boring kind of thing the the statistician phd statistician world  renowned and going over his evidence and getting the statistician on the stand to say yes my i made  a mistake in this statistical uh um uh testimony and which i thought you know nobody knew there was 
[01:18:00]  a mistake there because you know who would know who the hell knows statistics but this this uh this uh  high regarded um uh phd professor of statistics saying you know you're right i didn't think of that  but you're absolutely right i made a mistake that blew my mind wow that's why oj walks around  we gotta go back and plays golf plays golf on instant feedback steven s from bayshore he writes has uh  has the good doctor ever told his wife during an argument that she better watch it because he can 
[01:18:30]  make it look just like a heart attack if if i ever told if i ever told my wife that i would not be  around for no but uh um steven s also has one for the english uh coroner he writes uh the queen's not  looking well is peter wringing his hands together in joyous expectation over cutting into that royal 
[01:19:00]  clump i think the royal family has wonderful genes and she's gone for a long time yet but also there's  one coroner assigned to the royal family right i would assume really since henry the eighth time  they've had a coroner appointed uh as the royal coroner she had a code my head's gone  well henry the eighth decided that there should be a coroner appointed to prevent malicious bloodshed  within the royal palaces ah i think you reckon he could look after all the non-malicious bloodshed  himself i would assume he was probably you know at the beck and call of uh whoever's in charge if 
[01:19:30]  something was a little fishy yeah i mean historically it's interesting to look back at that stuff the  way it all developed yeah absolutely but you see yeah the the thing i would love to do is they didn't  have a royal obstetrician who made sure the baby came from the right person ah one of the the the two  the two things that i would love to do in my is one to exhume william shakespeare and do certain  things there which are interesting and the second thing is to do dna to do dna on all the kings and 
[01:20:00]  queens you know where are they buried all in uh westminster abbey and do dna to see who really  belongs and who doesn't belong in the in the lineage boy would that shake things up yeah i bet  there's a couple of gaps in there i would imagine so what would you like to do in shakespeare what would  you like to find out what's interesting shakespeare he died around 1620 and um in those days when you  died people who gave eulogies like ben johnson and other giants or they would give the eulogy and then 
[01:20:30]  have it written on rag paper rag paper stays much longer than than uh wood paper and they put it into  the casket and it would be wonderful to see if any of these eulogies are still intact because the body is  buried inside um the um the church in uh stratford on the stratford yeah and um that though whatever's in 
[01:21:00]  that casket might still be in good in good condition there's a logo there's it written on the casket  something about um anybody who uh who dis disinteres me um um that break his bones or something like that  you know they were always afraid in those days that um people would be disinterred and things robbed  from them so there's an interesting uh four line uh allegedly uh written by shakespeare about people 
[01:21:30]  not disturbing his body after death so you want to get you want to get the boys together and do some  uh grave robbing well grave investigation grave investigation what about uh you said you did uh billy  martin's death yeah billy martin was interesting because um he died after leaving a bar around  christmas time in binghamton new york with a driver and they went off they skidded off it was snow  and he's billy martin is dead in the passenger seat and the driver is drunk in the driver's seat and 
[01:22:00]  brought to the hospital and it always occurs when two people die in a um in a in a car crash whether  they're as with billy martin or a fire often they're fires and one lives and one dies after  talking to a lawyer the the guy who the person who's alive remembers that he wasn't the driver  and the issue came up as to who the driver was and we were i was able to investigate the car and go 
[01:22:30]  over things and the hair in the in the um in the driver's side um which belonged to didn't belong to  billy martin it belonged to the other guy but when i went in to get the hair sample uh from this guy  who said he was in the passenger seat um i got a court order to get the hair sample he's in the  hospital he's talked to his lawyers and he's sure that he was in the passenger seat and while taking  the hair when i pulled it out a little bit his uh ill-fitting robe sort of separated that he was in 
[01:23:00]  hospital and there's this huge impact of the um steering column on his chest and the problem with  that is it doesn't appear in the in the in the records because it didn't break anything so they  didn't have to treat it they didn't get paid by blue cross for doing anything so they don't even  mention it but looking at him there was the steering wheel impact against his chest which  clearly showed that he was a driver yeah he went to jail for that too pardon me he went to jail  it was you know he didn't he didn't go to jail but this was came up really in a civil lawsuit 
[01:23:30]  in a civil lawsuit because he was suing uh they were suing each other billy martins people were  suing him he was suing billy martins i i don't remember if he went to jail or not he may have gone  to jail for a little bit he there was a criminal trial you're right he did go to jail but for a short  period of time and what about uh it said here you get with phil specter's murder trial for the defense  yeah i was called in there because with which is coming up again the phil specter case is coming 
[01:24:00]  up again and uh i'm still on a gag order so i can't really talk too much about it well but um  the issue is the that um the weapon there was a gunshot of the mouth that the the the gun was inside  the mouth and she dies of a gunshot wound and one of the things i testified in open court so that  is that 99.9 percent of the time when there's a gunshot wound in the mouth it's self-inflicted 
[01:24:30]  you don't kill people by putting guns in the mouth because they keep their jaws shut and just the way  it works out is it's self-inflicted and that that was part of the testimony was that the issue was  whether he held the gun or she held the gun at the time it went off whose hand was on it's like  chicago whose hand was on the gun you know was there powder burns on her hand at all or powder  there was a lot of powder in her hands none on his oh all right huh yeah which is the usual way we tell  things but in los angeles the prosecutor there was so much publicity about it they they brought a 
[01:25:00]  murder i know they wouldn't settle for anything else except murder one but idiots that's so interesting  how la just like terrible prosecutors robert robert blake the robert blake case i got involved with  that a bit because uh he was in jail for um they're quite a while uh because of um uh he there's no bail  because it was um uh he was in waiting and hiding and waiting to shoot him so there was heard the death 
[01:25:30]  of the wife plus he was laying in wait was the thing that got him no bail and the reason that that  that um uh they was laying they said he was laying in wait because the gunshot wound was going from the  jaw up into the head an upward angle so the police thought that meant she was sitting up and he was  he was below the window and shot her that was that was the reason there was no bail the lawyer called  and we talked to the lawyer about it i said the the thing is if just because the gun is uh shot is 
[01:26:00]  going up uh that's how we describe things at the time of the autopsy but if she saw a gun coming and  she leaned to the right to the left it would still be all right same angle but it'd be horizontal and  it's not laying in wait and the lawyer for uh for uh blake was able to cross-examine the uh person  who did the autopsy the expert for the for the um prosecution who agreed that that was not 
[01:26:30]  laying in wait that this could have been her reacting to a person she saw with a gun in the  hand and that permitted him to get out and to not be in jail while the trial uh preparation proceeded  and he was uh he was acquitted so uh do you think in your personal opinion uh what do you think i didn't  get involved in the rest of the trial i think that uh i believe in the american system i mean if the  jury said not guilty uh it really doesn't mean he didn't do it it means no it just prosecution 
[01:27:00]  didn't prove it yeah they didn't prove it and i think that the prosecution has a job to prove its  case and the problem is that um if we know somebody's guilty and we're going to say that  we don't need a trial we know oj's guilty we know they're guilty um you're going to have a lot more  innocent people in jail we've got hundreds of innocent innocent actually innocent people who have  been serving time i've been on cat on death row and stuff like that and um we have to be careful  not to uh make it easier to convict innocent people and if a couple of um guilty people 
[01:27:30]  get free that's the price you have to pay for not getting innocent people and so that's a delicate  balance so you think let's put it this way you're right about the court system but do you think when  robert blake talks to god for saint peter there may be an issue yes there could be issues well there  could be issues with all of us when we talk to whoever our maker is and i don't mean to just keep 
[01:28:00]  going down the list but you've been involved in so many interesting things uh what exactly is with  the klaus von bulow klaus von bulow was very interesting because a lot of people think do you  think that he killed his wife i don't know wasn't she injured once and then killed or what was the  story with that she's still alive oh she is still alive she's alive in a nursing home this this happened  back in uh in the uh 1977 or so 70 around that time so that's over 30 years ago and she's been in coma 
[01:28:30]  since uh but alive uh and the issue with klaus von bulow she was in one in her mansion out on newport  rhode island and was found unconscious in her uh bathroom and the nurse who took care of her  like miss danvers in in rebecca or something uh was sure that the that that the husband had injected 
[01:29:00]  insulin into her even though there was no evidence the evidence was faulty that there was any extra  insulin in her body and she remained in coma he was there were two episodes right the two episodes  as she lost consciousness but it turned out that there'd been studies done at presbyterian hospital  in new york city that she had hypoglycemia that she would drop her glucose very low um uh without any  provocation and pass out and that may that's probably what happened to her that a couple days 
[01:29:30]  after uh she was in the hospital the barbiturate level the sleeping pill and alcohol came back very  high and enough to kill to cause her to go into coma but that my impression is that when i looked into  the case and all was that once the um prosecutor had accused von bulow of injecting insulin and uh trying  to murder her uh the doctors didn't come forth and say no she'd had an overdose of barbiturates and  alcohol which she may have taken herself because she was drank a lot of alcohol took a lot of pills 
[01:30:00]  uh because they didn't want to get sued for missing the diagnosis you see if they had treated her right  away for the barbiturate overdose uh they she may not have gone into coma into permanent coma so i think  she's in coma and he underwent two trials first trial he was found guilty and then it was overturned and the  second trial uh with dershowitz and puccio tom puccio uh who found not guilty so he's alive and out 
[01:30:30]  he's alive and well and in in um london and with children and grandchildren and she's uh in a coma  for 30 years and she's in a coma do you dream when you're in a coma  probably not you probably may dream but not know it because the that part of her brain is totally  atrophied i mean it's like uh the gal down in in florida uh who was shiavo who was in coma for  10 years you can have parts of your brain that are damaged and necrotic uh that you can't think you 
[01:31:00]  don't see or you don't feel anything but the breathing center and the cardiac center are still  working so with proper care you don't get pneumonia you don't get ulcers but bed sores because she's being  handled very she can live for a very long time just without any consciousness what about the people  that do come out of it because i mean when you look at shiavo's the videos of her it really even  though they said it was a response but when the father's talking to her and she's like even though 
[01:31:30]  it was like it wasn't like a really good conversation it looked like she was some interaction  going on sure yeah an interaction yeah yeah but that you see that's the problem the problem with  these things is that families want it in my experience i don't know about shiavo they want  to feel something for their loved one they'll say yes she squeezed my hand or she blinked her eyebrows  or she looked like she was paying attention and families want to hear that they look for that and  it's not always there certainly when they did the autopsy in shiavo and examined the brain it's not 
[01:32:00]  possible that she could have known what was going on from the brain uh examination oh so they were  actually the ex-husband was right about she was yeah the ex-husband turns out he i mean uh he wasn't as  likable as the family and he had a girlfriend and all that but uh he was right about her being  in coma and in fact uh in the first couple of years the doctors who treated her there's something  to do with high potassium and all uh paid out money you know because of medical malpractice about 
[01:32:30]  shiavo and now what they were saying 10 years later is that really it wasn't the medical malpractice  it was the fact that he beat her up yeah oh wow and that was turned out not to be true wow so  okay about also about sunny von bulow i i know i know i know little very little about comas but  isn't it like a a type one or type two or something like that once whatever type you're in you kind of  look like you might come out of it someday but you never will is she beyond ever coming out of it  because people it's called the nagel yeah yeah the the the uh uh she uh um sunny von bulow will 
[01:33:00]  never come out of it uh occasionally people come out depending on what part of the brain  is damaged and it's amazing today with all the cat scans and mris and all one can get a much better  idea of which parts of the brain are damaged than was possible you know 20 30 years ago but it turns  out with that with sunny von bulow she'll never come out of it shiavo would never come out of it 
[01:33:30]  some people are marginal why wouldn't they just put her like like killer i mean or just unplug the  machines or 31 years that becomes that becomes a discussion you need to have with god yeah that  becomes a moral issue and also the issue is she's got enough money to she's got enough money that she's  paying for all this nursing care that she gets and she has a big fortune to do that the issue becomes  more more telling when the person is on being paid for by the taxpayers of the city like uh like uh 
[01:34:00]  i'm not going to pay for it but i want the city to pay for my uh mother's uh eternal uh survival in  coma and meanwhile the money that goes to that person doesn't go to kids who right have uh uh sore  throats or rheumatic uh fever or uh strep throats and all that stuff so there's a delicate balance as  to how much money society should pay for somebody who's not going to recover even though the family 
[01:34:30]  wants it uh and it deprives there's no limited budget anymore in medicine you just you just want  them all on the slab don't you you just want them all see the slab but one of the things we do on  this slab you see is we we try to help the living by finding out what what happened uh we can try and  tell the families what happened we tell them if they have any genetic problems to worry about and  we can help society if somebody's done something wrong to punish the wrongdoers also so the reason 
[01:35:00]  we do the autopsies is to help the family bring closure and to help society uh pursue whatever  should be pursued when a death occurs are you going to be very good are you going to be called  in for the uh the bigfoot autopsy or i saw the photos there certainly looks like a raccoon code  or something but i think i've been involved before with bigfoot stuff because people really yeah people  used to bring in um material or something yeah hair and blood spots that they saw in the woods 
[01:35:30]  to ask us to do uh serology to look for i hope you charge them a lot no we i found it interesting  we should do it for free but it all turned out to be you know not true so the the little experience  i've had with bigfoot there ain't no bigfoot but uh um we found one in the dumpster though there we  got to see what that's all about they have something that looked like and the newspaper is like some  kind of old raccoon coat yeah yeah it looked like uh yeah an old raccoon coat they threw some pig 
[01:36:00]  23 skidoo but but it's interesting that there have been some uh uh very well-known uh hoaxes uh on  the we had the piltdown uh man in uh in the in in the united states piltdown was london it was  english case piltdown was the english case in the 1920 1910s um some people at an excavation site in  england found skull and bones and a jawbone that looked like they came from the missing link the 
[01:36:30]  missing link because it looked part part human and part ape and the professors in england all came down  they said what a wonderful find is the missing link and it turned out that somebody was playing a hoax  they believe it might have been sir arthur conan doyle because he had been in africa and it was really  the jawbone of an ape and the skull of a human you know and he had put them together and all these  professors uh thought it was real so that the fact that it was a hoax didn't come out till 1942 
[01:37:00]  where after all of the professors had died because they were afraid to embarrass the professors by saying  and then it turned out that it was a hoax because people somebody threw body parts into the into the  pit uh to make it look like it was a new animal when it wasn't all right let's get alex in o-town  alex hey what's up guys thanks i had a uh question for the doc i was going to ask him uh you guys were  just talking about basically the whole procedure with um what what happens uh how much care you should 
[01:37:30]  give a uh you know to somebody that's basically never going to come out of a coma my girlfriend has  had cancer about four times already and uh she's had to go through dialysis three separate times  and because of her having such a high risk of cancer they're telling her that basically she can't  get a uh kidney transplant because they don't consider it worth their time i guess um i just  want to know what your opinion is on something like that yeah the problem with that kind of a an issue 
[01:38:00]  unfortunately for your girlfriend is that there's a national organ transplant kidney organ transplant  organization that tries to provide the kidneys toward the people who are going to benefit the most  and uh there was a big criticism remember when mickey mantle i think was dying of liver cancer  oh yeah they gave him one and they gave him one there's a big there was a big uh a fuss made because  he jumped the line and he got the liver transplant that instead of somebody else getting it even though he 
[01:38:30]  wasn't going to get cured because the cancer had spread through his body and he died shortly thereafter  so they want to give it the kidneys to those people who are going to live the longest as a  result of the kidney transplants and that has nothing to do with the medical examiners that  has to do with a consortium of um kidney donor personnel and the problem is that there's such a  shortage of kidney uh kidneys for donate that are donated and one of the things that the the  government is trying is to get more people to donate kidneys when they die don't you think though if 
[01:39:00]  you hit over 500 home runs you deserve a kidney uh i think there's there's there's a good issue  there sure right yeah i think as a human being i i feel that way but not as a doctor all right  thanks guys thank you thank you we should let uh the good doctor go yes it's fascinating having  you here well it's good to see you guys and uh to see what comfortable surroundings they give you  and they give you all this uh oh yeah reading material oh yeah anything we need terrific thank you 
[01:39:30]  yeah thank you so much peter and yes peter thank you uh for uh stopping in with dr podden yeah thank  you did you enjoy it there uh peter fascinating fascinating what was your favorite part just always  really good listening to michael hey who collects uh dead tattoos i do that's true yeah all right get  back here peter keep snapping your pictures photos photos photos yeah not the actual real fast we're  still on the air oh because this came in i didn't believe it and uh you collect dead people yeah 
[01:40:00]  one of the ways we identify uh decedents is by tattoos they're very unique and uh i got interested  in tattoos uh a long time ago at the beginning and i've taken a hundred thousands of photographs  of tattoos of people in new york city who died in new york city and the regions have different kinds  of tattoos we have a lot of criminal tattoos in new york city prison people who who get them in in uh  in prison how do you know that prison tattoos are different sure and uh in other places like 
[01:40:30]  the people coming over from cuba had mario boat tattoos which were different and the east coast tattoos  tend to be different also so um uh it's it's been very interesting because you get all kinds of  interesting tattoos thumb through that little photo album you're asking me what's the best tattoo i  ever saw well no but you could yeah sure there was uh get a guy who's a true story who's an alcoholic 
[01:41:00]  who's dead and he has on his uh penis tattoos or it was very interesting and it said on his uh was your  name and you know made a prison type tattoo which was not professionally done yeah and when the brother  came in i asked the brother uh why uh uh do you know what that your brother had a tattoo on his  penis is sure is it what was the uh what what did it mean because often there's significance he said  well my brother was an alcoholic he never had enough money uh to get drinks and alcohol so he'd go 
[01:41:30]  into a bar true story go into a bar up to up to a um a guy he didn't know and said i'll bet you a drink  that i have your name tattooed on my penis and the guy would look at him said sure  and then he'd pull out his back and he'd get a free drink your name your name that's a long way  to go how thirsty are you yeah well you will just put prison dye ink in your dick and show it to  people for a drink for a drink can you tell us if an executive producer is gay by his tattoos 
[01:42:00]  there are certain gay tattoos yes one you want to get some tattoos we had we had uh peter sit down  we had one of my best tattoos is uh a guy who was a hunting scene uh hunting scene multicolored  professional with uh hounds and and the fox tail sticking out of the anus he's running into the  anus and i i uh thought that was a wonderful tattoo i showed and then somebody pointed out that was a 
[01:42:30]  gay tattoo i hadn't appreciated that oh here's steve you want to take a look at his no i noticed his  tattoos these are professional tattoos yeah turn around show him that one why are you hiding the  one that might be i'm not i'm not he's just holding my arm see these are not criminal tattoos  no these are professional sure how long ago were they done um the most recent one is the one under my  um bicep and that's about two years old that he gets a paycheck as criminal but you know it was  interesting in watching the in watching the uh olympics the great number of olympians who have 
[01:43:00]  tattoos yeah but they're not criminal tattoos they're little butterflies and names and things  like that the criminal tattoos are like the cross which is a pachuco sign uh just with the line not  not fancy like uh steve has on him and then of course the teardrop well la teardrop for the eye  and the drug addicts what does the teardrop mean they just saw on golden pond  just uh as best i interview some people just that they were sad about something in their life 
[01:43:30]  and the mother died or something they killed somebody well the killing tattoos are a little  different they're i thought it was a the teardrop cb no no the ones i saw were drug addicts who  okay but there may be they can cross over what were the killing ones uh what are the murder notches  the murder ones tend to be pachuco tattoos at the base of the thumb where in order to uh have this  cross with three lines above it oh made a prison tattoo three dots or three lines you had to 
[01:44:00]  commit murder arson and rape in order to properly put those on your fingers and then in prison they  knew you were a bad guy couldn't you just get someone to tattoo it on you anyway and yeah but  then but then if you turn out to be a wuss you're not going to last very long yeah you're not you'll  be the last one on that in prison the last one you mentioned yeah the faculty class a paycheck is  criminal steve has a question uh there isn't doctor there's an urban legend uh that foundry music  was a good band exactly uh that uh when when new bodies come into the morgue that uh protocol is 
[01:44:30]  to have the anus sewn up yeah of course no no no not true that's not true mike it's not true yes  someone just suggested to you that you have yours so what is we do look at the anus because sometimes  one can tell if there's been sexual activity in the anus by the shape of the anus but that doesn't  work usually either but they don't get sewn up because anything that's inside you want it to come  out if they can't tell by the anus can they just look at the expression on the face if it's really 
[01:45:00]  sad they're like well maybe looks like you can't tell you can't tell anything from what the face  looks like even though in in books they say well died happy died not not happy it's because when we  die all the muscles relax uh and we all become uh sort of faceless and then depending on what position  the body is in on the left side on the right side in the front will depend how the rigor mortis is  going to set in after death so you can't can you do a public service and tell people not to watch 
[01:45:30]  uh their loved ones uh die it's not romantic that's that's that's the tough thing oh as we talked about  earlier uh when i i started out really in in the uh business of uh treating living people sure uh and i was  an intern resident bellevue hospital and the worst thing was watching people die cancer heart disease  you couldn't do anything about it that's terrifying that's awful in the family it's awful but once  they're dead and this is what people don't understand about uh uh medical examiners once they're dead they're 
[01:46:00]  out of their pain and what we do is much less upsetting doing autopsies trying to help the living  uh than watching people die right how about the beheading videos did you see any of those  i saw saddam hussein and i read about the guillotine that's a quick way of uh doing away  with somebody but i i mean the al-zarkawi uh in the middle east when they would be heading people  with butcher knives that's that's awful that's awful it seemed like a really a painful way to go like  this well it depends how quickly it's done if you can take a a weapon like a guillotine and just 
[01:46:30]  strike off the head uh that's much faster and probably less painful you know actual physical pain  than um uh being shot you know in a firing squad or even getting uh lethal injection now this was  actually the state they saw through the head with just a big butcher knife and you can hear the guy  that's terrible that's terrible because they saw through the neck see the neck part is about a third 
[01:47:00]  of the is soft tissue of the neck and the heart part is the spine spinal column and that's where  it's hard to cut through but if you have a you know person who knows what he's doing  could you still be conscious as they're trying to hack through your the spine part of your neck  yeah you can still be conscious until they transect the spinal cord which takes some doing because  you got to cut through tough bone oh we saw some i know it's awful it's an awful situation well peter's 
[01:47:30]  depressed now let's stop oh wow we're all having fun yeah no kidding oh just you know peter want more  pictures cheer you up a little bit peter peter it's it's it's uh really a thrill for him to take  pictures of live people yeah thanks guys see you guys thanks very much enjoy your cruise thank you  hopefully you'll find a floater drag someone in for you a man could dream right there you have that  all right doctors a big man peter all right there you go very uh lovely to have them in 
[01:48:00]  they're fun right yeah great guests they're just a fun loving fun loving that is a hoot corners  christopher mad dog russo guess what listening to the worst of open anthony  this is primetime sam roberts and you're about to hear me light up a mic as only i can do  on the worst of the opie and anthony show 
[01:48:30]  rob zombie everybody hello rob we haven't talked to you in many many years we go way back we used  to talk to you when we were at uh waf but i don't all right yeah i don't think you would remember yes  i do and then we talked to you uh when we were doing afternoons for a while yeah that was a while  like although yeah yeah right we've had we've had a few screw-ups since then been around but 
[01:49:00]  shuffled around always land on our feet i'm very jealous of his friendship with tom papa  tom's really you are oh it makes me sick i want to wreck it because tom's like the cleanest cut  comic he's like you know he tours with seinfeld like a letterman guy and him and zombie are really  close and it really bugs me how did that how did you meet tom papa i don't know but everyone  keeps asking me that that was like a big topic yesterday too like how would you know tom papa  and it's a simple i couldn't even remember how i knew tom papa because i was kind of thinking 
[01:49:30]  like yeah why do i know tom you're saying the same thing why would i hang out with this but i remember  we uh both flew across country to this not together but we ended up at this wedding together that was  so boring that we just started talking and you know we we just sort of bonded over the misery of  being at this wedding and then we you know it's all it takes sometimes funny guy yeah he's a really  good comic i like funny guys it bothers me that that somebody i'm friends with is friends with a  rock star that i like well jimmy you being a comic also you would think that you would have friends 
[01:50:00]  like that you have like uh sully from god smack yes there's a friend of yours yes he is uh ozzy  osborne has no idea i'm alive you know now sully's all insulted you said you don't know any rock stars so  he's like no sully i'm an ozzy fan and i watched him the other night he performed on the top of the  hard rock and me and florentine stood for an hour and 20 minutes and waited for him to come out the  side door really like what's wrong with me you're like a kid i know you already have pictures with 
[01:50:30]  you have every single thing you could possibly have of ozzy there's nothing rob we got to explain he  has to get pictures with everybody that's famous and uh ozzy especially he's like an uber fan uh  he's got multiple photographs with ozzy he's got with him audio he's got how many you need  exactly thank you this is going it's not thank you you're not going to become friends with him  yeah there's nothing how many times that is his fantasy he doesn't want any friends this is what  i want your but rob is right this is what i where is this going is pretty much what i was saying to 
[01:51:00]  myself at 11 30 at night i'm 39 and i'm waiting for a british alcoholic to walk out so i could just go  hi i remember me i didn't think you would take care god bless he even has a picture with all of  black sabbath when they were inducted into the hall of fame yeah the rock and roll hall of fame but  here's what i want from ozzy i want ozzy to one time walk out and i'll go hey and they'll go hey jim  and keep going that's all i want it'll never happen i know you could be on tour with him for a year  and it would you know you've given him a new hope though he's hoping someday it's like jimmy isn't 
[01:51:30]  this a boring wedding it's so boring it's mine i'm right you know whore sit down tom papa will  come in and c-block you from him too i mean i don't know maybe tom papa you know he'll hang out with  you yeah he'll hook you up hey you dude uh i'm really i'm also this is another thing that makes  me very jealous and sick is that you have to work with malcolm mcdowell who's uh one of you know my  all-time idols obviously from oh yeah you get it bad don't you this is yeah i'm just an envious  little fanboy did you uh well who does he play does malcolm mcdowell play the donald pleasant yeah 
[01:52:00]  he plays dr oh wow uh we're talking about halloween obviously we should go up to speed the remake of  halloween directed by rob zombie you're considering it a remake or is it a new vision you know i don't  know is everything's just a new term for the same thing it's a remake i guess there's a lot of new  content so remakes makes it sound like you know it's like a shot for shot read you know redo which is  not so it's but you know it's the same story yeah a lot more backstory and a lot more stuff added  uh what about i gotta ask you the the captain kirk mask is that still uh part of the yeah we 
[01:52:30]  we yeah i mean that's really the only you know if you lose that constant yeah what the hell is it  no we are like jason making a new friday the 13th with a catcher's mask on or something you should  have it uh yeah a william shatner mask of what he looks like today yeah today it's the price line  shatner right age the mask like shatner aged why halloween like what what when did you say all right  this is a movie i just i just want to redo or do well i didn't i never thought about it before  it just was one of those opportunities that came up and somebody offered it to me and at first i 
[01:53:00]  didn't want to do it i just thought maybe it was kind of a stupid idea but uh you know i went away  and thought about for a couple months and came up with the way that i thought it could be done you  do it differently and then you know what the hell jumped in on it why is it coming out when it's not  coming out halloween it's coming out like september right yeah i don't know august 31st august 31st it  comes out i mean i don't know that's fine with me if you come out i think that's smart because then  you'll get another little boost at the box office right i mean if it came out on halloween by november  1st everybody's like i'm over it you're done with halloween yeah you're sick of it yeah i always 
[01:53:30]  thought that it was stupid to have these movies come out right uh a couple days before halloween  that's why every christmas movie comes out in november because if it came out on christmas  the next day we're sick christmas is over it's over yeah nobody's going to see the santa claus  it's the build-up to the holiday i guess yeah it's december 23 all right good i'll show you that  i'm in show business for 17 years and i know nothing why not just release it on the same night  all the kids will go explains the aussie scenario is it the same music the same music in it the same 
[01:54:00]  some of it yeah yeah well we we took the same you know music and redid it a little bit so it's  a little different but it's pretty pretty close it up a little bit not really because we whenever we  try to jazz it up or anything it sounded kind of like cheesy oh really simple and so perfect that  when you kind of like try to it's like the jaws overdo it yeah when you overdo it you go like why  are they ruining something that's perfect so we kind of left it the same and then we tried to do  other new cues that's you know had the same body did you do a um any uh cameos you get any uh  jamie lee curtis face in there or anything no no playing the teacher i love when they do that 
[01:54:30]  i didn't want to do that good you know it breaks it breaks the reality you're watching the movie then  you go oh why did they i don't need that awful movie that i i thought was awful the uh  remake of lost in space which was just horrible and they had a cameo of everyone that was still  alive from uh lost in space and it does it just takes you right out of it you like to oh there she  is there's the mother and there's adam they had to throw her a bone yeah major west look he's playing 
[01:55:00]  some guy that isn't major west yeah he's playing an old guy i'm just imagining uh his version of  halloween a lot of hot chicks right well yeah a lot of busty busty hot teenage bodacious busty broads  it's hard to find normal girls to be in a movie yeah it is i always liked the regular normal like  girl next door chicks in those movies were always better than the busty blonde oh yeah no i tried to  find people that look normal because you can't you watch that like oh it's haddenfield illinois and 
[01:55:30]  here's the school girls yeah they're all out of hollywood plastic surgery in illinois  how violent is it like because you seem to like a gore it's not that gory but it's pretty violent  more than the original uh yeah but i mean the original is pretty tame when you watch it now gore  doesn't get people these days as much as this weird kind of suspense jump out at you crap it's like  like things that scared me i'll tell you what petrified me was the ring either the original 
[01:56:00]  japanese version or the even the remake american version that kind of crap that like just comes  out at you or that old time black and white weird movement yeah i mean gore is not scary no it's you  and if it's too much it's laughable yeah people start laughing yeah no i kept that to a minimum and  you just i just kind of you don't want it to be real you know so it's just the actors selling the  scares and the suspense yeah also you don't want to see the monster too much when you start seeing 
[01:56:30]  the monster too much in a movie it takes you out you're like you want to be surprised when he's  just jumping that was the best part about halloween though you'd see him walk by a window real  fast and then you wouldn't see him for two minutes yeah and you forgot that he was walked by a window  she didn't see him and then all of a sudden he's right behind her with that mask and he never ran but  he caught everybody it was like michael myers is the slowest walker ever he's like and all of a sudden  she's running and then five minutes later he's right there with that stupid tilted head he was  horrified let's say he knows all the shortcuts yeah yeah that's it speed walker that creepy 
[01:57:00]  outfit yeah what scariest film you've ever seen would you have to say scariest film i always thought  jaws was the scariest movie ever so that was the one time i ever remember being scared but i was also  in third grade so the extras didn't scare my girlfriend saw that recently with me she'd never  seen it and then she's like no it was good but it wasn't scary like nobody ever thinks anything's  scary it's annoying i'll fess up to being petrified at a lot of movies i can't even take like ads on tv  it's late at night it's dark i'm like thumbing through the uh channels and then that stupid  you like uh the grudge ad came on yeah and i was like god damn little kids and those two girls in 
[01:57:30]  the shining every time i cannot look at them way down the hall that kubrick shot of them way down the  hall come play with us danny whoa i can't look the first half of the shining is just scary as all  hell yeah well so is the second half half is scary well second half is more funny grady and him in that  bathroom scene is a scream your son is attempting to bring an outside party into this situation i thought 
[01:58:00]  the first half was really scary because because of the whole transformation of his character  yeah and then he was what he was for the second half like a complete lunatic but watching him  losing his mind in the middle of this uh yeah hotel i i saw it recently and and the way he grady  changes in that bathroom of course it starts out with oh let me get that off of you sir let me and  then when he's like you know you chopped up your wife and kids and then grady knows the jig's up it's 
[01:58:30]  like over and then he just gets this attitude like you know you know what you have to do yeah perhaps a  a bit more needs a talking to i like a talking to or perhaps a bit more either have a chat or chop  them into pieces and the beautiful thing is that nicholson catches him he goes no no no you chopped  your wife and daughter up and then you blew your brains out like uh-huh yeah i gotcha gotcha like  crazy you're right i did commit suicide let me get the avocado thanks for mentioning it that was one of 
[01:59:00]  the classics hey we should change gears slightly here you know how we're talking about ozzy with uh jimmy  norton like he's an uber fan of ozzy yep we have an uber fan of rob zombie in this room right now  and you met him oh yeah it's the same thing that you're saying about jimmy it's not even a joke  but you don't have an ozzy tattoo do you no this guy has been freaking out about this this is sam  our own hello yes and look think how he he was panicking because uh uh my my girlfriend had a 
[01:59:30]  a gallbladder surgery last night so i was calling up everybody going look i might not make it into  the show and when i don't make it into the show we usually don't do the show because it's kind  of awkward and stuff so this show was almost going to be canceled and his little heart was going to  break if he didn't get to meet you or see you here today it doesn't get met before yeah we met at  comic-con and i remember oh wow i'm like the aussie scenario yeah i i yeah oh jimmy hello jim

[02:01:00]  when you get the autograph to it well he did an autograph signing when he came out with dedicated  horses at uh in time square yeah and i signed with a tattoo gun  well now that's permanent separates the real fans oh boy we're gonna be here a while  it's been 10 hours and he's only on the second person look how rosy his cheeks are right now  oh yeah drive home from syracuse because that's when i was going to school yeah just for the one day 
[02:01:30]  like i drove home that morning so i could get there i had my girlfriend wait online at the virgin uh  store uh with all the uh people for a for you know a bracelet oh my god oh my god he's never  like this wow and then and then so you know i finally i decided at the last minute that i would  just ask him to sign my arm and then uh we went to the concert which is the nokia theater uh right  after it and so i had to take another day off school to uh go to the tattoo shop as soon as it opened the 
[02:02:00]  next day and get it signed and you went go right over this and by the way don't you screw up your  hero doesn't eat like an eight-year-old you know you should change your yeah your eating habits you  know someone that's into rob zombie like this you think you'd eat a little more i don't know cooler  cooler the guy eats like an eight-year-old he eats like an eight-year-old child this guy eats just  like an eight-year-old like the aunt just said how is that i don't remember how an eight-year-old 
[02:02:30]  eats well watch we have no idea what he ate last night uh uh sam what'd you have for dinner last  night it was an elio's last night uh elio's pizza and some uh some more celery celery sticks and he  eats um like fish sticks and and chicken fingers yeah he eats like finger food that you give a little  kid right because they make much and then he washes it down with a big glass of milk every night big glass  of milk and for dessert he'll have like gummy cola bottles it tastes like cola but they're like gummy 
[02:03:00]  yeah waxed what was your dessert last night drink whatever that was out of it we got more ice cream  so i got to have ice cream last night oh sweet any any topping on there sprinkles or no we still don't  have any any toppings in the house oh that's a shame we'll have to buy you somewhere that you like rob's on  zombie like with line of richie being your dad it's just weird it does look like the head from  the hello video do you want to ask that clay head that the blind girl made oh god yeah didn't even 
[02:03:30]  look like him look like neanderthal man yeah jesus but the whole point was even though she's blind  she knew exactly what he looked like god damn well the guys prepared questions the caveman from the geico  ads the guys the guys prepared questions for sam to ask rob zombie ah thank god look at his rosy  cheeks you're getting to talk to your hero in an equal setting look at rob he's like oh come on  like this isn't gonna be good for any crap now believe me it's different than the average interview 
[02:04:00]  though we try to do things differently i'm glad he's a realist and not working this up to something  good right this is gonna be a lot of fun for everyone rob i want to apologize this is gonna suck  rob's like whatever can you at least promote halloween's coming out go ahead sam these are  questions um how would you rate your remake of halloween on a scale of one to ten one being really cool  ten being ridiculously awesome  eleven wow um why do you skip the oh you already know the answer to the first one yeah the first one 
[02:04:30]  one was do you remember me do you remember my tattoo but all right yeah we have established yeah  yeah it's weird um what do you think about the current direction of hard rock  oh god it's coming back a little bit there was a there was like a five-year period there  no a little shaky dude it's still pretty shaky oh yeah you think my theory is that uh it all died with

[02:07:00]  sam hold your hand out straight  you're a mess i try to take a when i went to comic-con in the press room i tried to take a picture  uh with my uh iphone but it's hardly you can't even tell because it's completely blurred we'll get  a real picture well i i mean luckily my girlfriend is there with a real doing some kind of tapping  thing with your leg too i'm noticing this is my one i told fan this is my one vulnerability this is  that it's his week he's holding on to the counter you are his kryptonite walk out from there 
[02:07:30]  because you're someone catching mickey falls yeah look at look at him  he's so vulnerable right now  and what happened did you get your picture today yes i did and what happened well yeah i uh  i'm shaking he's got a lean on something he's very uncomfortable oh is he uncomfortable  i asked him if you'd be so kind to sign uh the other two pictures i had with him and then asked 
[02:08:00]  him to sign the third one at which point he asked if there was anything we were doing in this picture  that would make it different  good for you good for you ron geez what an ass well let's get the pictures we'll compare yeah  yeah are they is there anything you want to ask that you really want to know yeah one last question  because we have to take a break here like your own yeah sure um what creatively did you get to  do differently as a solo artist that you didn't get to do when you left white zombie oh as the lead 
[02:08:30]  singer of white zombie uh truthfully i creatively sort of stayed the same i just didn't have to argue  with everybody anymore makes sense you know how how did how did you get all that dust off of you  you used to be very dusty little mini back remember that time that was awesome hey this is rob  zombie and you're listening to the worst of opie and anthony opie and anthony  opie and anthony it was awful worthless they're the worst just screaming every racial epithet you 
[02:09:00]  can think of an abomination it's the worst of the opie anthony show we got this uh chick melissa pickett  she can't hear us right now she's an eco-therapist we were turned on to her by uh watching  bullshit oh you saw oh i saw this episode yeah oh that's right you're in that day i'm sorry i  actually i know who you exactly who you're talking about so we're going to lead her on a little bit  and and you know say we're really get into it and yeah we saw i'm really into and we're hoping for 
[02:09:30]  maybe a good ramoni possibly yeah maybe a little bit of interrupting interviewer or maybe uh maybe  some serious phone calls from the listeners all right be smart folks game on let's say hi to melissa pickett  we'll get her on you got her yeah we're we really want to talk to uh melissa melissa are you there  i am here i am hey hey melissa pickett uh thanks for calling the greg and tony show how are you i'm  great good uh we were turned on to you because we we saw you on that uh that bull uh well we can't 
[02:10:00]  say the word dookie no the bull ass show that uh pen and teller do on showtime uh-huh and we were  fascinated by uh what you what you offer and we felt they kind of gave you a a bum rap comment  uh no i don't feel that way um i i actually did watch the show in fact just yesterday yeah and uh  found it humorous yeah the the subject matter you know the the final um place that they came to in 
[02:10:30]  the show was they couldn't dispute uh or affirm human impact on the planet exactly that's what i  noticed too and uh i think they were making light of uh of the work that you're doing which um  i think is fantastic helping people in such a way was uh a very noble thing i think it's uh very  important uh uh to uh have people uh get together and be one with nature like that well you know i 
[02:11:00]  first uh came to the work that i'm doing and the focus of this because i had people coming in to see me  and they were complaining of all different kinds of symptoms and as i began working with them to try to  help them figure it out yes yes yes uh it became apparent that root issue was their their concern 
[02:11:30]  for nature and environment and this was this was actually affecting them physically it can affect  them in many different ways that's uh that's quite amazing that uh just this and is it a guilt thing  eco guilt i think you call it eco guilt is that well where i see that show up is in people not knowing  what to do and if they if they are driving their vehicle if they're if they're feeling like they're 
[02:12:00]  not doing enough sure they do feel guilty when they throw away trash yeah plastics they do come they  do comment about i feel really guilty i feel bad i don't know what i can be doing and and it's really  important not to go to a place of helplessness it seems like the uh the carbon footprint people are  leaving seems to be uh how would you say it um detrimental yes yes that's a good word um to 
[02:12:30]  everything right or wrong certainly uh you know my the way that i look at it is i can't exactly say  what my impact to the planet is every day well you're helping you're obviously helping you're you're  you're giving a hoot yeah well i think that's what we all have to do in our own way in whatever way  that is and you know the the way that i look at it is i have to be having some impact in in the way i 
[02:13:00]  live and how can we have so many people i'm sorry i'm sorry no you no you go how about you because  you were all right no go ahead i'll go you want me to go i'll ask all right go ahead no no you you  go you're excited about the very very yeah very we're jumping over each other so bob once you uh 
[02:13:30]  are you sure yeah okay i'll go i'll go yeah how you doing this is rich voss uh how are you this is  melissa pickett hi melissa how are you i'm a big fan first of all saw the show and uh big fan i just  wanted to get into uh the rocks i mean you you went to the parking lot you picked up rocks out of  the uh out of mother earth i did i would say right and you handed them to these people and what does  that do like can i just go to ever tried it no i mean i live in manhattan so it'd be hard i'd have to 
[02:14:00]  dig up the sidewalk there uh well think of it i'm living on one and envision how you feel when you go  out into nature what is the effect of that uh-huh you feel naturally slowed down right you feel calm  you aren't around a lot of hustle and bustle so you have clear space yeah what do you mean by hustle and  bustle well a lot of static around you it's a lot of people a lot of airwaves a lot of radio waves  you know uh day-to-day life traffic horns honking sirens going you know what's the effect of all 
[02:14:30]  that on the nervous system do you pick you know what i've noticed the world's gone and gotten itself  in a big damn hurry we are in a big hurry that's part of the problem we are we're going so fast we're  not paying attention yeah melissa so what does a rock in your pocket uh do the rock in the pocket  is to help you remember that there is something that you are connected to that you've forgotten 
[02:15:00]  so you feel it kind of it kind of uh when when you live with the daily grind as we like to say  the rock in the pocket centers you a little bit it centers you well i wasn't finished but you go right  ahead you just go ahead i didn't mean i wasn't finished but go ahead oh go ahead do you feel that  it's um it grounds you and will help refocus you or is it something that's going to kind of  distract you because your your mind will be elsewhere um all right sorry about that go right 
[02:15:30]  ahead it's centering no no it's all about you i didn't actually talk on the radio show a part of  go ahead yeah what were you saying centering we'll finish this one you were uh it's centering in  in what way i i feel better really way to say it i just feel better any any time you know if you  have why do people like to put flowers in their offices yeah yeah we all know about that but let's  get back to what you were doing with the rocks do you feel because a lot of people say that the rocks 
[02:16:00]  are a distraction i've heard that argument made yeah as you say they're centering and i've heard  other people said they're a distraction and they remove your focus because they they put your mind  in a place where you're not focused on the task at hand um you know i've heard that  well but um all right go ahead i'm sorry whatever you want to say you go right ahead maybe we should  just give you the mic okay it's kind of in a way just yeah i'm sure it is theoretical discussion  because the truth is in the pudding and uh what does george harrison's head have to do with any of 
[02:16:30]  this yeah we we don't understand that whole truth is in the pudding thing what does that  really mean it's the proof the proof is in the pudding it's an old saying but what does that  really mean though the truth is in the pudding the proof yeah it's in the experience okay sure  sure but but but you excuse me if someone wants to have if someone wants to find a way to have the 
[02:17:00]  best most functional fulfilling life and they are concerned with their well-being and how they can  make we got we got i get what you say we got to focus you you're rambling in circles melissa pickett now  what is an m-a-l-p-c what exactly does that stand for yeah uh licensed professional clinical  counselor oh very nice very nice what about the um the labyrinth this sounds very mysterious almost  frightening well there's a lot of information on the internet about the labyrinth and i think people 
[02:17:30]  can look that up for themselves i'd like to know about your labyrinth and what that um what that means  because i when i saw it uh it labyrinths uh oh they scare me a little bit well try it out see what  see what you are yours made out of hedges no they're in a cornfield they're stones do you remember that  scene in the shining that it was so scary oh my goodness right there was the uh they had choices 
[02:18:00]  you know i i want to go back i know you said i was sure you go ahead you run the interview  oh no no go ahead we're just guests on your show because i don't think the question is is answered  no no well go ahead whatever you think there uh ted koppel take us wherever you want we're just  we're just actors in your play the um for for people who are looking for a way to have a healthy  happy life sure we're on this point again go ahead whatever whatever way they can find to make  connection with with some deeper part of themselves is what i encourage right okay should we go back 
[02:18:30]  anymore what else do we do wrong apparently we're not uh asking questions your satisfaction go right  ahead it's all about you you go ahead yeah go ahead welcome to the melissa pickett show go  i think melissa is making some uh fine valid points here this is because i've noticed melissa i've  noticed i feel terrible uh when i use certain things that i know are going to be in a landfill for a long  time uh these are these things affect me what can i do to make myself feel better about this 
[02:19:00]  pay attention to how you live and do do the little things melissa i'm feeling ego guilt  i'm sorry yeah this is uh this is uh ted melissa he's uh uh please bear with us he's a bit slow i try  to be environmentally conscious and yet i find myself leaving a bigger carbon footprint that i intended on  leaving we feel like all voices should be heard on our show so ted's a bit slow but uh his point is uh  just as important so uh please listen to ted melissa 
[02:19:30]  what can i do to help lighten my carbon footprint  that will be your turn to answer the question because i tend i tend to do things like when flowers  are blooming i'll pour gasoline on them well that's not very eco-friendly no that's not  melissa melissa yeah you're not answering my questions i need help what could you uh tell uh  ted today ted's yeah ted's a little you know melissa i'd say uh 
[02:20:00]  ted's a little stressed out yeah a little bit all right let's go to our phone calls they've been uh  wanting to uh talk to you all morning here uh let's start with bob in connecticut  bob you're on with melissa pickett she's a eco-therapist hi good morning uh greg and tony  love the show long time oh thank you sir thank you bob thank you miss pickett mrs pickett i'm sorry 
[02:20:30]  excuse me i'm not familiar with your work i'm not sure if you're married or not but i have this tremendous  ego guilt anytime i use the bathroom to the point that i forced myself to contain my bowel movement  for the last two weeks and it's becoming extremely uncomfortable and all i can do all day is daydream  about taking a giant steaming ship oh yeah wow um booyah uh melissa we're gonna have to beep that 
[02:21:00]  yeah we're yeah they beeped it down the hall but uh he makes a very good point because uh you know when  you're when you're doing that we how do we explain it on the radio when you're when you wake up  in the morning and you do that uh isn't that uh uh wrecking the environment in a way  the um the concern that people might have with that is the use of water for example we live in a drought 
[02:21:30]  area here and we had people who were very concerned literally with their toilet flushes  they were concerned about conservation of the water and not having it yeah and uh you know that became  a concern for people in new orleans of course that became a concern for people in atlanta but they had  plenty of water in new orleans it's it not drinkable oh so you know i got confused because you were 
[02:22:00]  talking about a drought water is a uh the nectar of life we don't have water we can't exist oh i like  that nectar of life so if you don't have water you can't exist no no not at all are you suggesting we  raise a generation of uh super kids i'm suggesting we raise a generation of conscious kids sure and  should we give kids rocks like if you give a should you give your kids rocks or is that  would that be for like adults or is that a certain age or can that help kids too i suggest we take 
[02:22:30]  kids out into our park yeah camping we give them experiences with oh yeah we get them off the tvs and  the computer where did jimmy go uh melissa did uh we got a soldier that came back from iraq and uh  this i i i've been following the green movement and this is uh this has come up a few times uh rich  in colorado what do you have for melissa pickett the eco-therapist hi melissa i'm a huge fan of yours 
[02:23:00]  i saw your show uh well i saw you on pen and teller and uh i saw your little labyrinth the rock garden  and it reminded me of when i was in baghdad for 15 months and i was walking around in circles  there kind of being doing useless stuff but the question i have is i was driving you know those  big huge humvees around which put all the carbon footprint stuff and i was wondering how much of  a carbon footprint do ieds leave i have no idea i'm not environmentalist so you'd have to go on  the website figure that out for yourself but you would imagine melissa there would be a lot of ideas 
[02:23:30]  there's a lot of smoke and stuff and a lot of parts from trucks flying around i was just wondering  like what would you guess like ballpark figure what are we talking i have no idea because i'm  not an expert in that area all right but uh the point uh being melissa that that that i'm sure that  would uh bring on a lot of guilt if you're one of these soldiers that uh is fighting the the good  fight over in iraq and afghanistan yeah i would i would hope that we would all just send a uh 
[02:24:00]  good good words and a blessing of support sure oh sure let's hell yeah we can we're running out of  time uh because we got to take a break for the uh the npr news but first we got steve from uh where is  he from a yellow something yellow yellow yellow star hello yes you're on with melissa pickett steve  i i have a a bad connection i may speak with miss pickett uh you're on the line with uh miss pickett  oh hello hello i'm here i i think that a lot of people don't seem to take the uh environment 
[02:24:30]  seriously and i don't think that they understand that their impact like people don't feel as individuals  like because i personally had my stomach stapled and yet i didn't change the problems inside that  made me do that to begin with um and i find that uh what's really been happening is people don't seem  to understand the impact we have that are on the earth that one person can make a difference  i hope that we all are probably understand that what's that i'm sorry i i said i hope i hope that 
[02:25:00]  you're doing your part to help people understand that well i find it but it might sound crazy but  i'm not drinking really bottled water anymore i'm drinking tap water because i don't want to  continually use all the bottles and the plastic which i don't believe are recycled properly that's  probably true could you elaborate on what else i could do because i'm i'm feeling like i just don't  know but i really do want to contribute and participate accurately i'm really worried about this one though 
[02:25:30]  because again it always hurts my throat and yet it plays funny on the air so what do you think i  could be doing differently add to what you're doing  someone leave a carbon ball print on this bitch's nose bridge  ramon melissa carries rocks under her clith hood  ramon melissa should be chased through a labyrinth by a bleeding edge patient 
[02:26:00]  are you finished yes that's all i wanted to say but i really do want to know what you 
[02:26:30]  think i might be doing better to help the environment oh my goodness you know it never  fails caller gets through and uh she didn't answer my question we couldn't uh we couldn't cut it off  quickly enough i'm so sorry melissa that uh sometimes these callers get through and they  just want to make jokes there's no need to apologize let's just let's allow that anyone 
[02:27:00]  listening to this show in their heart of hearts make their own decision about what's happening out  there how it's affecting them and let them know that we're all human and we're all sharing in the world  together god damn rich cunt yeah i hear you that makes good sense it sure does uh melissa  hello hello yeah yeah okay wasn't sure any other any other questions or any other callers 
[02:27:30]  yeah we have uh plenty of uh calls coming in yeah why don't we uh this is a very good question  coming in from steve in uh union new jersey steve hi melissa how are you doing today good how are you  i'm excellent i i uh i realize my ideas might not be 100 percent orthodox but um i was really wondering  what you thought about um marijuana see i believe that that comes from nature and it's very difficult 
[02:28:00]  for me to be centered when i'm not really big so what's your question comment my question is uh how  you think that helps the ego footprint because i mean i'm planting a lot of trees here in new jersey  and uh you know it's helping people get centered in their lives i'm just wondering what you think  about that she said she's not an expert on that are you are you feeling uh a bit of guilt because  you're smoking the weed steve oh not at all not at all uh melissa can i ask you something yeah uh of 
[02:28:30]  course we're concentrating here on the united states but um there there seems to be a lot of uh uh  i don't know it's almost eco crimes going on in other countries you understand what i mean so it's kind  of hard uh for us to do something knowing that uh other countries are just uh screwing up by the  numbers here you know i don't think it's just a united states problem it's a world problem it is a 
[02:29:00]  world problem and we got uh you know to the south we have uh uh mexico uh just pumping out uh pollutants  and uh to the north we got just moronic stupid ass canadians uh that just don't know uh anything  about anything to tell you the truth that brings a lot of stress and guilt yes a lot of guilt yeah  i mean they're like our retarded neighbors to the north that have to be cared for and coddled 
[02:29:30]  as they ruin the planet sure uh we got uncle paul uh checking in uncle paul you're on with melissa  pickett the uh eco-therapist uh hello this is paul hello how are you you know i i teach uh children  and uh what is it it seems it's very hard to get an eco-responsible message through to younger people  because it all starts at home with the interfering parents that's true and what is the best way do you 
[02:30:00]  think to try to get that message to children because i deal with the very young kids and it's it's very  hard because they don't understand consequences or what tattling can do to somebody so exactly what is  it how do you make that fun for children uh meet children where they are i'm not sure what you  mean although that sounds playing outside letting them draw talking about what they like in nature 
[02:30:30]  letting them go  melissa should pick up rocks from her driveway with her conch lips  somebody fuck this four-eyed bitch in the back of an suv with the air conditioning going full blast  this four-eyed nerd should be sodomized with a giant sunflower  you know i want to go back to the comment about uh yeah because it really seems very hard to get 
[02:31:00]  that message across because they just they keep telling you tell them this is going to get me in a  lot of trouble you've got to keep your mouth closed but they tell they always tell part of the 
[02:31:30]  problem is we we want to blame other people  yeah no well gentlemen i've enjoyed our time together today  i um have to go out in the world now and  and so i'm going to wish you well 
[02:32:00]  all right  somebody tell this dinosaur next  bitch to shut up already to have a wonderful day  i understand yes your parts thank you  thank you  yes  thank you so much be a better place  i agree god bless you all thank you so much uh melissa pickett  bye-bye there it goes i think that was a real cop-out melissa pickett 
[02:32:30]  oh this has got to be the funniest  oh my god  i don't think there's anything funny  when he just  i don't think there's anything from you  on the fucking planet earth  i don't think there's anything  fucking funny what the fuck jimmy  hey this is pen gillette of pen and teller and you're listening to the worst of opie and anthony  when you see a lake you think picnics  and i see a large mouth up on that log

[03:00:30]  that was depressing hey but i want a lot of echo can you put a lot of echo on me  hey this is lee turkerson you're listening to the worst of opie and anthony  all right let's get uh the cockroach count this is all i thought about this week  la cucarachas we learned last week that there are uh cockroaches that have completely invaded and taken  over this facility it's infested it's infested um so we laid down some traps on friday saturday 
[03:01:00]  somewhere friday and now we get to see what our traps caught sam has one of the traps in his hands  one of the other trap that was under a file cabinet just got one  oh god that one's this one was under the sink and has the real problem is that there's like at least  i count six to seven baby cockroaches okay which means they're reproducing 
[03:01:30]  oh wow cockroaches reproducing in an environment of filth and fucking food and disgust  they're also all still alive because they're moving their antenna but they can't move because  they're trying to figure out they're trying to communicate hey my feet are stuck so are mine  idiot talking to each other how are your feet stuck i'm walking but i'm not getting any closer  what's happening yeah it's glue idiot we're in a glue trap this we're so dead  i'm walking you're not getting any closer could you explain that ted the cockroach 
[03:02:00]  it said the imperceptive cockroach i'm hungry but there's no food to be found and i can't seem to  get anywhere so there's a total of 16 baby cockroaches in this and full sizes one two three four five six  seven eight nine nine nine full-size let me see that so there's 25 in this one trap alone  yeah oh we're the real big guys though i the big fatties like the one that uh post stepped on the 
[03:02:30]  other day oh my they're there one yeah he's right look at how many cockroaches look i can't stand  the cockroach there's way more than 16 disgusting little tiny ones in here one two three four five six  seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifty sixty seventeen eighteen nineteen  you said nineteen on the one side and then one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven  twelve thirteen you missed fourteen you missed that guy dude there's there's thirty something in this 
[03:03:00]  trap alone you miss counted well i got one in this trap so that's correct and and one in that yes  so there you go be funny there's all those roaches and a dog or a turtle just some weird animal  hopefully uh there's an armadillo in here let's fuck it hopefully travis's bulldog will get caught in  one of these oh that useless animal yeah absolutely or travis's beard and by that i don't mean lisa 
[03:03:30]  here he's gay here you go oh come on  no it's all right and it's okay the road strap bounced right by you yes i know one of them might  have fallen out yeah get that look they're all moving around do you think they're saying to each  other hey uh we just got thrown and yet we didn't fall out what do you think happened it's new safety  standards unfortunately safety standards that's why you see the gloves are good thing they don't want  us to fall we're buckled up yeah that's good so now what are we laying down some uh new traps yeah 
[03:04:00]  put some another new trap under the sink because that's where the cornucopia of roaches came yeah  sure uh i put one in poe's office because i can only assume how many roaches will be found in there  yeah all right so yeah so not bad for our first uh our first hunt we got about 30 to 35 cockroaches in  the two traps well the one trap wasn't impressive at all but no well you know it adds one right let's  go to north carolina again sean yep you guys shouldn't be killing the cockroaches in studio 
[03:04:30]  because the eggs don't crush and then they uh sit on whatever you kill them with whether it be like  sole of a shoe or something and then you uh transport those eggs into your home  and then so you step on one and then you walk like three city blocks in the heat and uh  um and then still the eggs are still good yeah so you don't understand i don't i don't actually  step gingerly i moonwalk when i go home yeah i moonwalk and dance over roaches you might be 
[03:05:00]  okay if you moonwalk home yeah i do because it scrapes them all right we're learning a lot about  cockroaches a lot of people saying don't step on the cockroaches you'll bring the eggs back to your  house i don't step that was poe i was the one that jumped on that yeah how great would it be all  of a sudden he came home there was fucking 50 roaches sitting on his front door gentlemen 50 less than  usual yeah i have a feeling that poe has a lot of roaches at his house you think oh yeah oh i hope  not being um we should ask you're profiling no they're creepy they're still moving in the trap 
[03:05:30]  yeah they're icky okay icky i thought they just cut it out  and you're gonna eat yes well i'm not that's what does it what's the matter there po i'm not gonna  pose insulted why why is poe insulted you have no roaches right you have cockroaches at your house  i guarantee it no i don't have any roaches but i had i had mice i don't have mice anymore  what happened you have mice still no how did you get rid of the mice i got rid of them because i 
[03:06:00]  with a spinning back kick tell me how you got rid of the mice and and what happened is they were coming  in through the uh the dishwasher and i covered up the holes oh wow yeah so you don't think you have  mice anymore well they're not coming in anymore i don't see any more uh how do you know they're  there if they are i haven't seen jimmy turned me on to the whole mice thing i go jimmy uh i i i  found a mouse in my apartment and jimmy freaked out he goes if you have one that means you have  hundreds i'm like shut up jimmy no fucking way i got just one dumb stray mouse and i killed that 
[03:06:30]  motherfucker in a glue trap and then proceeded to kill between 50 and 60 more with electric traps  infestation yes jimmy was correct oh they're all around you they're just trying to figure out how  to get back into your apartment because they know that's where the good eats are good eats yeah right  the num nums huh how'd you get how'd you get rid of the the mice i made a deal with them we played  tic-tac-toe i won three out of four games they had to leave that's right you temporarily got rid of 
[03:07:00]  the mice my friend so they're still there right yeah i would guarantee it know what uh any of those  electric traps around i'm not sure say one of those electric traps i guarantee i will bet you  a hundred dollars but then i don't know if you're going to be bullshitting me shocking that you find  one uh by tomorrow morning if if i set the one electric trap i'll bring it in with some peanut  butter in there okay all right you got it i'm telling you they're still around let's say hi to  dave in new york dave yeah hey dave how you doing guys good good evening hey you happy birthday jimmy 
[03:07:30]  thanks dave do you work in new york city i'm i yeah i work in new york city i'm a pest control  operator i'm licensed in new york and new jersey and i just want to let you know you can rest easy opie  you know those egg casings can be dropped in a bucket of acid and nothing will get inside them  but if you crush them with your shoe there's nothing that's going to hatch from them all right  what if one gets uh in the you know the yeah the tread the tread of your sneaker or something 
[03:08:00]  no they they can't you know they got to move around they can be killed very easily when they're  very small sir the way i kill roaches is i sit on them bare bottom what if some of the eggs get  caught in my ass hair i don't i don't have an answer for that i wish i did but hey dave  dave screw the roaches i want to know about rats uh you do pest control in new york city  yes i do all right what's your feeling on rats how many rats are in new york city  millions millions millions you know i go out and i i fight the good fight every day but there's 
[03:08:30]  more and more i read uh i finally i never told anyone finally uh got to the end of that rat book  that i've been uh you know picking up every once in a while and uh just fascinated with rats yeah  they're they're everywhere why don't we see more rats then everyone says there's millions and millions  in new york city but you you rarely see one usually they're not totally you won't see them until the  infestation is so big that they're running around the street during the day right so you know they 
[03:09:00]  burrow underneath and every once in a while like if you're driving up west street and you know how  they have those little you know those concrete things with the trees coming out of them on the  promenade yeah every once in a while you'll see one of them popping out or popping out of the sewer  from there they're just going to grab something and they're running right back into the hole you know  where i see a good amount of rats not now that they're not doing they're doing construction but  washington square park when you walk by at like three in the morning at the park you just see  like the great the uh the leaves scuffling constantly they're moving around yeah infested 
[03:09:30]  all parks are infested with rats yeah especially in the subway systems also i mean there's not any  time of the day you can go down in the subway and see multiple rats i know that uh when i'm walking  uh to the studio in the morning uh any garbage day just pick any garbage day that there's a bag on  the street of new york if you kick it rats will come running out of them and it's happened to be a bunch  of times just plenty of rats they actually come towards you and they turn around real quick they  can they can get you with their tail yeah and that hurts like a sumbitch how um how how bad have you 
[03:10:00]  seen like roach infested apartments or rat infested apartments i've actually uh lifted up drop ceilings  in office buildings and and apartments where it actually pours down i mean it looks like a showerhead  full of cockroaches are coming down oh they just start pouring out of the ceiling yeah it's disgusting i  actually when we're going in to do a clean out i have to wear um something similar to like a a tight  turtleneck kind of thing and zip up my my cover all all the way to the top how about a glue hat in 
[03:10:30]  case they fall on your head glue hat a hat made of glue i wear earplugs it's gross my neighbors think  i'm insane i gotta strip down before my wife lets me into the apartment i'm standing out there in my  boxes before i can i gotta bag everything up before i can come into my apartment sure and the thing about  rats uh you'll never get rid of them they get smarter with all the stuff you guys are coming  out with uh to kill them right they learn it's true well rats are smarter than actually much because  what a rat will do is send a probe rat out if there's something new in the environment when we 
[03:11:00]  date they'll send a probe rat out just to check it out see what's going on and if they come back  and everything's all right then i'll bring a few more of his buddies it's actually kind of spooky  a probe rat is that why like they've done studies on rats they've actually heard when you listen real  close one going but it's not my turn all right you got point i don't want to go so what's gonna  be a bad feeling about this one yeah what's gonna end up happening with uh with the rats let's say in 
[03:11:30]  new york city is they gonna get to a point where what's or do they control themselves because there's  not enough food like how does that work why aren't they continuing to multiply to to the point where we  have to just give up and leave new york city well actually if there's not enough food they will turn  to cannibalism right you know so it's just it's a kind of delicate balance between baiting enough  and then taking enough food and harborage away you know this is where like the parks department  comes in like if they keep all the stuff trimmed properly then there's no harborage for them uh you 
[03:12:00]  know we need to be doing a regular baiting thing uh on a regular basis for some of these areas where  where you know a lot of these uh they wouldn't allow baiting before that kind of thing what  do you mean by baiting like like like say telling one rat that the other one said something about  them wait why would they allow baiting well because you go you get a lot of these typical  conservationists in new york city that won't allow you know they feel that a rat is is you know an 
[03:12:30]  animal and you know animals have quality of life and that kind of thing for the conservationists in new  york state especially in new york city it's kind of tied our hands and kept us from doing the proper  thing we're fucking doomed yeah that's pretty much what's going us in are you kidding me ridiculous  environmentalists that's it that's it i mean i'm kind of glad you're here i have a job that's how i  pay the bills but i uh recently i was walking home um after a late night uh drink with some uh some of  the philly crew and stuff and we walking by a brownstone and there's some garbage and i saw a rat go 
[03:13:00]  running into like the front area of a brownstone where there's some garbage right i go wow that's cool and i  i want i went in for a closer look and i swear to god and maybe you could tell me what this means  that the rat hissed at me i didn't see it anymore yeah no shitty hiss that you it started hissing what  what does that mean was there babies in the area it was a cat no no usually what happens is when you  get too close and a rat is trapped it'll get up on his hind legs and kind of do this hissing kind of 
[03:13:30]  guttural sound kind of to scare something away or choose your face off dude let me tell you  i was fucking petrified because it was dark and all i heard was this hissing coming from  the darkness i couldn't run fast enough yeah it's it's disgusting what and the problem with rats is  on a hardness index their teeth are actually harder than steel is there a way when the rat's like  standing up like that you hear that you can't just blow by that their teeth are harder than steel  okay on a hardness index yeah they can make buildings out of rat teeth 
[03:14:00]  smarty go ahead jimmy i'm sorry but that that's an amazing like uh fact about rats they they could  gnaw through anything is basically what this guy's saying yeah they can actually gnaw through sewer jars  uh anything you know below ground any conduit that carries pipe uh that carries uh um you know electrical  wiring anything like that so they're really really a nasty nasty nasty problem and they also uh know how to  uh uh unlock their own jaws so they could like uh get through like tiny areas and stuff they unhinged 
[03:14:30]  their own jaws yeah they don't have bones they have college yeah they can flatten their skeletons out  yeah yeah if they can get their head into something they can get their whole body you can actually take  a rat and fold him backwards to where that you know his head is touching his paint kind of thing  right yeah he won't break his bones i heard that's the equivalent of tickling a rat  he loves it fold them backwards you can actually hear them go teehee look i'm sniffing my own 
[03:15:00]  asshole yeah they kind of laugh about it like oh you got me you got me that's a good natured about the  ribbon yeah the one thing about this uh book that i read they said um at any given time i think i  mentioned this on the air but at any given time when you're walking around new york city you're within  feet of a rat yeah they said there's all sorts of tunnels under every sidewalk they're in the  walls of almost every building they're just everywhere let me ask you it's like a whole 
[03:15:30]  network moving right under your feet while you're walking on the sidewalk what about this way of  getting rid of them i've heard this might work whereas like what you do is you get into their  like nests and you take out their little their little positive affirmations that they hang  and you write negative things and it's a pressure  you could do that cinnamon under cover like a little rat 21 jump street or something i don't  know all right thank you sir good knowledge thanks guys a little knowledge uh today for everybody  let's go to louisiana carly carly what's up wipe that out hey guys i have to tell you what happened

[03:18:30]  a lot of birds the house is black the house is black how did the birds get in what what did your  house look like well it's a little house on a stick and it just has a hole in the front  and that's where we live  and and the floor has all kinds of little seeds on it seed floor yes it's a gingerbread house and the  birds like it and that i can't even like talk to my boyfriend it's too loud we're having to scream  at each other were your floors made of newspaper maybe they misunderstood yes my house is made of 
[03:19:00]  cage wiring what's that it was that it was crazy and the birds flew in and they killed all the mice  and it was it went on for like 45 minutes and then they all left and we never had mice again and we  finished the house sounds like a scene out of heaven almighty that's an amazing it was it was horrible  all right carly okay thank god you are right yeah let's go to duane in minnesota duane  what's going on fellas what's up duane not much i was just gonna tell you to shut up let her finish 
[03:19:30]  your story but uh after that ending uh well you see we're kind of just uh duane here's the brilliance  of us because i see what you're saying up there do you have to ruin every story we knew that story  was going nowhere fast so we're trying to get some humor out of it no i didn't know where it was  going duane the bottom line is i i knew she was going to get to the end we were having fun with her  along the way what you don't understand like if we just would have let her say it then you have  to go back and recapture moments that you want to goof on it doesn't work so a lot of time i got 
[03:20:00]  you jimmy look at that he's cutting you off now all right he understands all right duane thank you  let's let's uh take a couple more here keith in jersey keith yo how you doing oh hey hey hey  i got a little story uh for uh opie and his little garbage experiences yeah uh i used to live in  manhattan and uh after a nice long night of drinking uh our stupid uh stupid little game was to kick the 
[03:20:30]  garbage piles on garbage night and watch all the rats scatter and uh we would all run after the rats  and try stomping on them and uh we used to catch a couple of them and make a nice little splatter  that's like serial killer shit though yeah you know there's a way to get rid of rats without  just stomping on them with your boot by the way that's a cool beginning to a story that's not a 
[03:21:00]  cool story that's a cool beginning that should be part one i think i think if you lined up a hundred  guys i think there's maybe one that would actually run after a rat and try to stomp it the rest of  them even though we'd all act like we're brave most of us like would be like fuck that you know the  best way to catch rats and i found this is you dip your dick in cheese ah and then when the rats grab  onto it you flick their little heads that sends out a message all right let's go to tony and jersey  tony hey jimmy you're on fire today you're killing me i had a huge bong hit it was probably a six 
[03:21:30]  dollar toke i swear to god and you said my house is on a stick with a hole in the front i lost the  whole thing i talked for two minutes you owe me kid i just want to let you know right on man let's go  to kansas city i didn't mean that though because that was a birdhouse hey guys this is kansas city  dave kansas city dave what's up how you guys doing all right uh i used to go to oklahoma and stay  with my ex-wife still because we still uh i still fucked her for a little while after we got

[03:31:00]  duty hat he made a duty he made a duty yeah jesus christ this boy made a duty this was on two  separate occasions though there was one one occasion of the duty hat and then there was another occasion of  him just lifting up what looked like a pulled pork sandwich out of the toilet bowl and then waved  goodbye to it and put it back and flushed it away bye bye and he had to say bye bye duty  we gotta show him that video we had it right that's big boy big boy makes a duty  we were extremely disappointed that this didn't take the internet by storm by the way greg yeah how could 
[03:31:30]  it not i think we had 112 people view this video there's a guy wearing a shithat and that didn't get  any youtube right what do you gotta do to get anybody's attention yeah really yeah i want to  talk about the cockroaches as he finds that video now how many cockroaches have we really seen  oh so many back there have you seen them yes i'm hearing just rumors i haven't seen them  there have been sightings get like people who have come here and have seen them right like where the new 
[03:32:00]  studio comes in right where the audience is there's at least two scenes there um when they were cleaning the  back sink like the first clean that happened at the beginning of the week they found six in one  shot oh like six just started running do we know where they might be hiding yeah yeah there that's  the front there's two fridges there's the front fridge and then the rear fridge and the ronafez office  that the front fridge i don't if anybody has anything in there just forget about it don't put  anything in that fridge i've opened that fridge and seen roaches running inside of the fridge they 
[03:32:30]  creep up on you how the they get in there i don't know but the roaches live in the ice in that fridge  like the ice maker has ice and roaches in it and the roaches are moving around they're  fucking dinosaurs right now i don't know if they're there now but someone go look i really want to  find like because they say if you see a couple that means there's hundreds that means there's a  million we found where are they then there's gotta be a place where they're really hiding the walls  we found at least a dozen here this week this week alone yeah and how are we going to capture these 
[03:33:00]  things get some glue traps okay glue traps glue traps for roaches yeah yeah that'll work absolutely  restaurants do that you lay them out because when it gets dark they come running around you know  trying to find them and they go whoa and they get stuck yeah because we got to have proof yeah jim how  can you eat after that i could i could be there's nothing i can't eat how about we get how about we  all how about this we all get a glue we all get a glue trap it's like it's just a piece of paper with

[03:39:30]  let's say hi to darwin in newark i just think it's funny by the way that i would have like that  we would actually have a glue trap by eric's mouth but a shitting rhinoceros is such a big animal  yes to stick in a glue trap i meant to discover it  that would have to be the weakest shitting right off oh yeah can't get out of that glue trap  what's up darwin yo you guys are smart as hell 
[03:40:00]  xm cannot afford to get an exterminator so he got you guys to manipulate a way to get these guys to do  the job for him very nice cool uh yeah well xm hasn't really done any upkeep lately no they don't  have enough to the point where we're infested with cockroaches yes sam i think i might know uh one of  the reasons the cockroaches is there behind that file cabinet where we just found a bunch we also  found an old bottle of eric's hawaiian punch  uh ladies ladies gentlemen green pie jones green pie jones what do you want me to do they

[03:51:00]  i can probably make his pocket if you want  no  all right let's see you rock everyone  well uh  jim jeffrey's admitted that he likes snowballing  that is a fucking gay thing i don't like snowball i just don't have a problem with it 
[03:51:30]  if you've done it when you say you've snowballed i've done it many times you  what's the definition of snowball  kissing kissing a  fucking woman with your own  after you come in her mouth  yep she kisses you with her with your come in her mouth  and you swap it that's snowball  no no no that's  fucking  i've done it when  you're going to say it's not gay and jeffrey's is not saying  wow  i've done it not even kissing where they've stood above me and spit it down my mouth  that's not gay 
[03:52:00]  sometimes i like to humiliate  because that's why you come in your own  mouth would you do it with someone else's come  no i wouldn't do it with someone else's come  that to me would be gay  someone else's come be gay  i wouldn't do it with someone else's come  have you ever gone down the girl where you've come inside her and then gone down on her  no that's  fucking despicable  you ever eat your own boogers but you wouldn't eat somebody else's  first of all you just tried to  trick me by saying i did something that you didn't ask me about  i said did you ever eat your own boogers  i didn't answer yet no  but it's a speculative question  i don't eat my own i never ate my own anything 
[03:52:30]  no  if there's spit in my mouth  that or if i  i gotta spit it out  really  i have to spit it out  oh i don't  no i know i'll just swallow it back  there you go  but that comes from two snowballers  we got a lot of reports coming in  fast freddy from jamaica station  snowballing is 100% gay  no it's not  absolutely  it's like i remember being like a 40 year old boy  and coming to my hand  both of you gay gyms  ew  more importantly  no i think it's because i learned what it tastes like  hold on we're out of something here more importantly 
[03:53:00]  i want to ask jim how does it feel to meet your clone  i never snowballed  but you two are very similar  the australian doppelganger  shape the same  fucking same thing  snowballing  this is like the australian uh version of norton right here  no i don't  i'm not saying you snowballed  but you guys have very similar tastes  yeah but i prefer to have a circumcised cock  it's like bizarro norton  yeah but it's fucking uh  i've done some filthy sexual things  snowballing to me was always just gross  like my girlfriend has kissed me like after she's blown me  even pecking there's a numbing it's horrible 
[03:53:30]  i'm felched man  i'll put any any  he's into humiliation  any juice any juicy pussy shit  hold on a second the guy just admitted that he's fel  you suck cum out of a girl's ass you fucked  yeah yeah  you're cum  yeah that's gay man  i've been  i've been  that is so  it's gay man  i've been wasted man  i'm just fucking  and i'm not  i'm only judging it because it's fucking gay  like it's  it's a  it's a gay thing to do  if you admit it  hold on  how many millions of people 
[03:54:00]  hold on  and my mom will never hear it  no listen nah  you gotta walk us through the  the felching  like  give us some details  okay  what's so bad all right  you're already looking at where she shits from  why don't i add a bit of cum  you're not but first of all see the thing is about ass about  ass licking the  asshole  the anus is not where she that the  shit is in the lower intestines  the  asshole is  licking the  asshole  licking the 
[03:54:30]  asshole is a  clean  i don't mind licking the  it is not clean  we live our whole lives  we have a  shit  we do is shit  there's shit smith everywhere  we dry it off with a bit of paper and go  that's clean enough for me  yeah  and then we lick the  fucking thing  no  you should take a shower  we don't waste the paper for what  if you take a shower but felch and do anything but you  no  does felch you know use any straws or anything  no no i'm not sick  would you make it sick  that's crazy  and it wasn't like i was going and now my dear 
[03:55:00]  the felching begins  did she sit on your face  it was just like i'll be  fucking  you break out a crazy straw  i'm licking a cum again i go lick her ass a bit  a bit of cum i'll lick it out  jim would you if you came on her stomach  yeah  if you think it's gay  to come on her stomach  and then lick it off her stomach  no i've never done that but i wouldn't think it's gay  not gay  i've never done it  humiliation is different than gay  gay is wanting another man someone's spitting your own  no i'm telling you somebody's spitting your own cum in your mouth  which to me is not my thing i've never done it i wouldn't do it  you're getting the taste of a man's 
[03:55:30]  fucking product  in your mouth  yeah but it's still the same chemical composition as any man's  come in your own hand and lick your cum out of your hand  before i had sex i had done that because i wanted to know what it tastes like  jim is gay jim jeffries is a sissy  it's not like i ate it  i just sort of put me in a tongue out  and you know what makes me  how many cocks do you take before you call it gay  i bet you simon kyle's a sissy too  i have never i have never touched  i have never touched a cock with my hands 
[03:56:00]  but there's been like a spit roast  where my cock is rubbed against another man's cock  like he's gay  why won't anybody join me  i don't think he is  no  jim is gay  i'm not gay  i don't know  he's rubbed his dick on somebody  i've never done that  no no i haven't rubbed it  i'm talking like  fucking a chick  yeah it's a fucking a chick  like if a girl's sucking two cocks at once  that's that's the most gay thing i've ever done  that's absolutely gay  because that is a fucking excuse  to have your dick  it's just because the  bitch's mouth is the receptacle 
[03:56:30]  but he was a friend of mine  somebody's dick  take the girl out of the mix and you're just rubbing dicks  yes  oh yeah take the girl yeah yeah  take the girl out of the mix  he's just humping the bed  hey hey hey  wait wait wait wait wait  let me just say this  let me just say before i forget  before i forget  what you just said  it makes a lot of sense  oh my god  it's all the gayness is in context  yeah yeah  of a girl  i'm gonna lick my cum  i'm gonna rub balls  i'm gonna do all kind of juicy  shit with my own insides 
[03:57:00]  but there's a bitch involved  that makes it not gay  exactly exactly  it's a publicity stunt  that's like saying having sex with a woman  if you take the woman away and put a man there  it's fucking gay  you can't just  you can't just take people out of the equation  let's do it  a strap-on  a strap-on's not gay  getting fucked with a strap-on's not gay  it's absolutely  no it's not  bracketing shit  are you out of your fucking mind  no it's not  you've never had a girl strap a cock on and fuck you up the ass  no not even ever  and she's waking you  i've never even had a bitch go fingernail deep in my ass 
[03:57:30]  oh my god  patrice hold on i was with patrice until then  but when we start talking about the strap-ons  these phones will fucking light up with guys that say that it's not gay  and that they've done it many times  it's not  it's a man  i've never done it  i didn't know that  why isn't a fucking woman with a with a with a with a uh uh uh uh  a virtual dick  because it's humiliation  in your ass hole  it's humiliation  it's humiliation  it's humiliation  i've done it right  what makes it gay is if the strap-on looks like a cock  if it looks like anything else then it's not gay 
[03:58:00]  no it's humiliation  it's all about a woman  yeah  do you believe that opie  if it's a strap-on giraffe or something it's not gay  if it looks like a fist  right  if it looks like a fist  a girl's fist  a girl's fist  i mean it sits on your face it doesn't make you a chair  if it's like a fist and it's got an engagement ring  but but if you're getting if you're getting if a strap on  if a girl puts a strap on  all right wait can i ask  if a girl puts on a strap on and fucks you in the ass  it's humiliation  no no  i'll tell you what no dude i almost had it i couldn't go through it 
[03:58:30]  it's not humiliation  it feels awesome  a dominatrix one time  doing it to me uh and she was staring me in the face  she was fucking staring me in the face  and called you a faggot  no  i couldn't i couldn't do it because it hurt  but it was it was about this woman with these beautiful tits being so perverse  i didn't think wow i wish that was a guy's cock it was nothing to do with it  it was her she turned me on however you rationalize it  thank you but i didn't do it thank you  okay if any girls out there that would like to date a guy that does all the things that i do  please please email me 
[03:59:00]  or men any men that want to date him  i want to go backwards a little bit because you said you know he's a friend of yours so  i immediately i was thinking anthony and i'm like oh jesus  Hold on, hear me out, hear me out  Trust me, he wasn't there  Anthony, trust me, we're on the same page  So we're friends, could you imagine  We have  No  No, don't even say it  One girl's mouth  One girl's sucking both on cocks  And both of you, first of all 
[03:59:30]  Even being around another motherfucker  Okay, take the sexuality out of it  Your dick is just in the vicinity  Of my dick  That's the problem I have with swinging  The one thing is just the  If we swing and swap  It's the dick  Get your dick out of here  You take the dick out of it  Only women like anything  That has to do with a dick  Men shouldn't like anything that has to do with a dick  And I'm not even being a fucking homophobe 
[04:00:00]  I'm just saying  Dicks are not a pleasurable looking thing  Well you grab your own dick  What's the difference  Put that on another guy  Is masturbating gay  Because it's a man's hand on your cock  To jerk off  You're giving sexual pleasure to a cock  Look, if you can convince me  Jerking off is gay  But I'm saying  You're gay  You're gay  Because I jerk off  With your big manly hands  Just a different thing  But you're a feminine cock  I don't think that's being gay  But if you can tell me that's being  I'm not going to  Put it this way  I'm not going to stop saying 
[04:00:30]  Felchin and Snowball is gay  If jerking off is gay  Then we are all gay  But you're also gayer  No  You can't be gayer  You're either gay  Or you can't be gayer  There's no one  Well you could be gayer  Jerking off is gay  Felchin is super gay  Jerking off is not gay  Alright, do you ever had a girl  Put a finger up your ass?  Who hasn't?  No, I'm just saying  She gave it a try  Didn't like it  Okay  Not a fan of that  You're the most heterosexual man in the world  Or you don't have a prostate gland 
[04:01:00]  No, no  I just  It just  You know what it is?  It's just  The penetration  It just feels funny  Like, you know what?  This should not be happening in my ass  Alright, what about if you  Fucking go in the ass?  It's a strange thing  If you fuck a girl in the ass  That would be gay by your definition  Because there's an ass in that  I enjoy woman ass fucking  I enjoy woman's asses  No, no  Men and women both have asses  You know  So you're fucking a woman's ass  It's not like she's got a cock too  And she's used to being the fucky  Women 
[04:01:30]  Everything about a woman is going inside  Her mouth  Her asshole  Her ears  Yeah, so the second something's going inside you  Yeah  You are taking on the feminine role  I'm just saying  You can argue that everything's  Something goes inside you  You're taking on the feminine  How about guys that get tied up?  Guys that get tied up and trampled  And stepped on  It's all about humiliation  That's humiliation  I'll give you that  All of it is  Men are saying normally  My sex is pretty standard  They're humiliated gaming  These are isolated incidences  These are isolated  He's saying his sex is pretty standard  These are isolated incidences 
[04:02:00]  This isn't like  Tuesday  Every day  Right  You're fucking sucking  Come out of your ass  Sometimes the sex is relatively normal  A punch here  A slap here  A cut  Is this a bunch of people on here  Opie who fucking enjoy felching?  No, no  Not  Well  Phones are lit though  I'll tell you that  We'll go through those in a second  There's a song by King Missile  That'll solve the argument  Someone is saying  Have you ever heard  Gay  Where is it?  God damn it 
[04:02:30]  A King Missile song called  Gay Not Gay  Someone is saying  If you play this song  It'll solve the argument  I'm sure that's a fucking band member  Writing it  Yeah, because rock bands  They have all the answers  Exactly  Alright, well let's go to this guy  We're gonna  You know  We do play  You know what  This is perfect  We do play a game on this show  Called Gay or Funny  Or Gay  We can change it to gay  Or not gay  Yeah, fine  Alright, because people now have  Things that they're calling up about  Fucking Trannies isn't gay  Alright, let's go to  No, no  Fucking Trannies is gay  No, it's not  No, no 
[04:03:00]  If you used to be a man  If there's a cock involved  That's amazing  That you were saying  No, no, no  Because he's like  Listen, I suck my own cum  Out of a bitch's ass  But this whole tranny thing  That tranny thing  And I happen to agree with you  That fucking a fucking man  Oh, I agree completely  Who thinks he's a woman  But he has a dick  But you  You've qualified him as a woman  Oh, stop with all your double talk  Yeah, you can  No, no  It's fat  Just because you put tits on a thing  Fat  You can put your pig onto the rib 
[04:03:30]  It doesn't make it a fucking swat  Oh, cut it out  Alright, let's go  Oh, come on  Leave it to Beaver  We're playing gay or not gay  Gay or funny  Right now we start with Jess in Chicago  Jess  What's up, guys?  Hey  Even my fucking girl thinks  Taking cum in the mouth  Is fucking gay  I fucking came in her mouth  On accident  She fucking swipes it out of her mouth  And slaps me in the face with it  Sounds like an enchanting relationship  Good luck 
[04:04:00]  She sucks  You pay for her  Shame on you for tolerating that shit  Yeah, right?  Swallow it, slobber  Walk home  Slap her back  This girl's not slapping me with my cum  So gay  They're spitting it on me  There's a vastly different situation  That's not gay  Because you didn't see the handful of cum  How do you accidentally cum in a girl's mouth?  No, I'm gonna go  I'm gonna go  And did she go  Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo?  Yeah  Jess was gay  Your name's girly  You're a fucking gay  Next  Alright  Glenn the trucker 
[04:04:30]  Glenn  Hey, everybody jacks off, right?  Yes, sir  But if you could suck your own dick  Wouldn't you swallow your load?  No  No  I would suck my own dick  But I wouldn't swallow my own dick  I wouldn't suck my own dick  So what, you'd stop sucking and beat it off then?  No, I'd beat off the end, cover my face a little bit, like I do with girls.  I don't want to have a cum in their mouths.  I just jack in my face and then look in the mirror and say, you're a nasty girl.  The guy on the phone says, it sounds like he really, he didn't even assume for five seconds  that some of us won't suck our own dick if we could. 
[04:05:00]  No, I'd suck my own dick, man.  Like, he goes, you'll suck your own dick, right?  No, I wouldn't suck my own dick.  If you say you wouldn't suck your own dick if you could, you're a liar.  Okay, I'm a liar, you fucking dickhead.  I'm not lying, I wouldn't suck my own dick.  You wouldn't suck, you would not suck your own dick if you could.  No!  But you'll beat it off.  That's gay.  Why is that gay, Jim Jeffries?  Because you're repressing yourself.  A dick is in your mouth.  Just because it's your dick doesn't make it not a dick.  No!  It's a dick in your mouth.  No, it's your dick.  Your dick.  Which is a dick. 
[04:05:30]  That's the same as saying, if you put your hand on it, you wouldn't put a man's hand on it.  What's the difference?  It's your hand.  Do you like your nipples licks?  Do you like your nipples licks?  No, I'm too busy swallowing cum for that.  I like my nipples licked, but I've never left it up to lick my own nipples.  That's gay!  There you go.  You think that's gay?  You've licked your own nipples?  No, because it wouldn't turn me on to do so, but I don't think...  I can't do it.  I can't do so sucking your own dick.  I don't get nipple play, man.  Like, Jimmy loves that. 
[04:06:00]  I don't get it, man.  Do you rub your nipples when you jerk them off?  Dude, I can't jerk off unless there's a woman licking my nipples.  If there's not a bitch around licking my nips, it's not even a feeling.  It's watching a girl with a tongue out licking my nipples.  If I have to pinch your nipples right now, is that gay?  Yes!  Yeah, a little bit.  Under the context.  If it's just fucking...  You keep your homosexuality to yourself, Jim Jeffries.  I just like this fight, man.  Jim is a sissy. 
[04:06:30]  I don't think he's gay.  Maybe not a sissy, but he's definitely a pofter.  A pofter.  He's got shame.  He's filled with shame.  That's a shame thing.  He should be, because he eats cum out of women.  He should be filled with shame.  I don't eat other men's cum.  There might be some residue from the night before, but mostly standard.  It's my cum.  It's mostly yours.  During the spit roast, there wasn't two loads of cum.  I didn't felch during the spit roast. 
[04:07:00]  It's not gay if you don't know you're eating another man's cum.  I don't know.  I don't know about that.  If you don't know.  In God's eyes, it's gay.  Yeah, yeah.  You know when you're...  He's going out for a piss.  Don't touch your own cock, you queer.  Yo, I just want to know one thing.  What about felching is normal, but adding a straw to it makes it weird?  No, no, no, no.  I just don't like...  Because it's just in the moment.  If you just go down there and look at girls' eyes in the moment, if I have a straw ready...  That makes it a little silly.  It makes it a little bit... 
[04:07:30]  You know, a spoon.  I would give you a spoon.  A teaspoon.  Yeah.  Let's see how to...  Heat it up like heroin and shoot it into my veins.  Brooklyn.  What's up, Eric?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Listen, for the past hour, I've been hearing nothing but cum and dick.  You guys are all fucking fairies.  I guess we're all a gang.  Yeah, hey, I'm fucking fairies.  You've got to cover this.  All right.  I wish that would turn me on.  Because I'm such a fucking pervert.  A girl spit my own cum in my mouth.  I would love to have a new avenue to go down.  Really?  It just doesn't do anything for... 
[04:08:00]  I don't want to lick her pussy after I fucked her.  It's not a major thing for me.  I'm just saying I've done it a couple of times.  It's not one of my things.  You do know you guys need to hang out, right?  Not to have sex with each other, but you guys have a lot of...  I do know that my agent was considering me being a support for you, too.  I think this could be a marriage made in heaven.  I have gotten into very disgusting areas sexually.  Very.  How far have you gone?  What's the worst?  Well, what's the worst that you can think of?  I'm just swallowing cum out of a girl's ass. 
[04:08:30]  Okay, look.  Jimmy's willing to play, but he's going about this slowly.  Just curious.  He's not tipping his hand here.  He's not tipping his hand.  He's not going all in yet.  We've got two poker faces going on here.  I've already told you.  I've had my cock touching another man's cock shoved into a girl's mouth  while making her say that she's a slut with two cocks in her mouth  so that she mumbles it.  That's about as bad as I've really...  And I've eaten my own cum out of a girl's asshole.  That's nasty.  Anything else you want to put on the table?  I'm trying to think of something else that would be...  Oh, there's a girl that used to like to be cut. 
[04:09:00]  But that wasn't me.  That's what she was into.  And just little razors that you cut up coke with  and just slashing her shoulder blades as you...  Holy fuck.  That's the worst I've got.  That wasn't me.  I don't like doing that.  It's not gay.  That's not gay.  All right, Jimmy.  No, but that doesn't make him a Puerto Rican.  Jimmy, you asked Jim Jeffries.  I like it.  I should have got more.  I didn't hear you.  That's all right.  Do you want a counter now?  I've never had my own cum in my mouth.  Not my thing.  Piss, would you do piss?  I've pissed on a girl, yeah.  That's probably standard, though.  Would you let a girl piss in your mouth? 
[04:09:30]  No, I would not let a girl piss in my mouth.  But that's just hygiene problems that I have.  It's a personal thing.  Not a bad thing.  I wouldn't have a...  I don't have a problem with it.  Would you take a load on your chest?  Yes.  No.  No, no shit.  No shit.  No one shit, Jimmy.  Yes.  No shit.  I don't have a problem with it.  I've watched the board.  I watched Two Girls, One Cup with you guys.  Enjoyed it.  Had a good time.  But no, no shit is going to be involved with me.  Two Girls, One Cup just didn't bother me.  That made me laugh, really.  That made me dry wretch, Two Girls, One Cup. 
[04:10:00]  Now, when you talk about being a creep,  Two Girls, One Cup turned me on  because of watching Two Beautiful Girls  just be that cruddy.  I don't need them being cruddy with me.  You know what I mean?  So if the girls are being disgusting,  it's something sexy about girls just doing dirty shit.  What bugged me about that was the shit and the puke were...  If it's a solid log, I could have enjoyed it.  But the fact that they were chewing it up,  that to me is incomprehensibly gross.  It just was kind of sexy to me. 
[04:10:30]  They have fathers as well that would have had to watch that.  Although, it's saying that,  I just hope my mom's not listening to this show.  We're going to go to Teresa from New York.  She's just amazed by the last hour.  Teresa, what's up?  What do you got?  I think this is...  Do you guys talk like this like when you go to bars?  We talk worse on the radio.  We're playing it down because the public can hear.  Yeah, this is the beauty of it.  Imagine when me and Norton are alone.  Oh, my God.  You guys are the most sexually honest people I've ever heard in my whole life.  It is just amazing what I'm listening to. 
[04:11:00]  It is unbelievable.  I love it.  You ever been fisted?  Yeah, Teresa.  What's the craziest thing you have done?  Oh, Christ.  I knew this was going to turn to me somehow.  Well, it's all right.  It's all right.  I'm really, really, really very plain.  I'm sorry.  I have nothing for the show.  Have you done anything?  I have no fingers going anywhere crazy.  Wait, Tudor, have you ever had a guy ask you to do something that you thought might be a little gay?  Gay on his part?  Yeah, like you're like, I don't want to do that.  I don't want to put a finger in his ass or whatever.  No, actually, it's gone the other way.  Like, I've tried it and it's never worked out. 
[04:11:30]  Okay, if I let it come out of your ass, would you consider me to be a gay?  You know what?  In the moment, I don't think you would.  Yeah.  I don't think the girl would because it's just some old, it's some, like, dirty.  Yeah, dirty stuff.  Like, treating a man like how you treat them because they're the fuckies.  Exactly, so if you get a chance to turn it around, you want to use every chance you can.  Wow.  And hold it against him, too, to make him less sexy.  Exactly, and talk about it to all their friends.  Exactly.  So he can get shoes.  Exactly, so she can call you a fucking cum-eating asshole, lick him. 
[04:12:00]  Exactly, and call all his friends up, tell all his friends what he did.  Oh, you like that, don't you faggot?  See, the thing is, with me, you can tell on my friends, my friends already know.  It's like, eight million people listening to this or something, they already know.  What's the big deal?  One of my favorite, you know what?  You can't disgrace me.  Teresa, thank you.  One of my favorite clips was brought in by Patrice, Gavin.  Do we have that for Jim Jefferies?  Oh, is that great?  Holy, can you set this up, Patrice, for everybody?  Not really.  You don't remember?  I wasn't here when he did it. 
[04:12:30]  Okay, Gavin is one of our friends that Patrice introduced us to.  He's real good friends with Patrice.  From England, by the way.  From England.  He was in a hotel room with a hooker, I believe.  The hooker strapped it on and did Gavin's friend in the ass while Gavin filmed the whole  thing on a cell phone.  And laughed.  And laughed all the way through it.  And his friend is getting it.  Gavin who?  I'm not knowing.  Gavin, no, he's as big as that doorway.  Gavin McLeod.  He's on a love boat.  And I thought that was gay at the time. 
[04:13:00]  And even Gavin just sitting there with the fucking camera, taping it, and listening to  this guy get mashed in his asshole, it's just, I'm like, this is...  Because he's in such pain.  Maybe you go way too far thinking things are gay just because they have anything to do with  something as opposed to what...  Because gay men kiss.  I think fucking fetches.  Can I say that?  I'm not saying this like, naughty, naughty, you're gay.  I'm just saying, that's gay. 
[04:13:30]  Can we be friends?  And there might be some things I do and I go, eh.  When Gavin set this thing up, I was thinking, wow, Gavin is gay.  And I'm certainly not going to tell him because he's about 6'6", 300 pounds.  And he's the least gay dude I know.  Yeah, now it's a fad on him.  And then we played this thing on the radio.  I'm like, it's not gay.  The guy just made something not gay.  Listen, we don't have the video.  He just gave us the audio.  The audio is really good though.  Listen to this.  We got it, Danny?  Yeah, but you guys are talking over it. 
[04:14:00]  We are?  Yeah, I have it.  It's just with you guys laughing and talking and stuff over it though.  All right, well, this is the only version we got?  I thought we had a clean version.  Yeah, I mean, I think Eric says that we should have it.  So if you want to just give it a minute, he might be able to dig it up somewhere.  Oh, E-Rock.  And I thought that was good, but you know, he's laughing and this and that.  I'm like, this is so gay.  But I'm not saying it like, hey, stay away from me, you fags.  It's just like I go, eh, ass.  Look at your own cuffs.  It's just gay.  It's like, that's gay.  But it's not like I give a fuck.  It's not like we're less friends. 
[04:14:30]  Let's get all the fighting in this game.  We got sucking your own dick stuff.  Tom at Alabama, yes.  Tom, let's go.  Hey, what's up?  It's Brian.  Oh.  Hey, yeah.  A girlfriend that I've been able to suck my own dick found out when I was 12.  So it was like heaven.  But it is overrated because you can't enjoy it as much while you're giving it to yourself  and receiving.  But I had a girlfriend.  Whenever we were fucking, I'd pull it out, put it in my mouth, lick her pussy juice off 
[04:15:00]  my dick and put it back in.  And she loved that and told all her friends about it.  Sagat.  So after we broke up, one of her friends out of the club knew I could do that, asked me  about it.  She said, I heard you can lick my clip while you're fucking me.  I was like, yeah.  So she went home from the club with me.  So that makes it negatively gay.  That's pretty funny.  Right?  Like, you can lick her clip while you're fucking.  You can lick her clip while you're fucking.  That's just like a magic trick.  You can't do that.  You can suck your own cock.  You can't do that.  Jeremy can suck his own cock. 
[04:15:30]  Can I ask you a question about this dick?  Why sucking your own dick is gay?  For the fact that, how do you approach sucking your own dick?  You try.  You try.  Like how a fucking bitch would suck your dick?  Do you suck your dick well?  Or you suck it like a dude who's not gay?  Do you suck dick well when you suck your own dick?  Are you doing a good job?  Do you twirl the tongue?  Yeah, yeah.  Do you let spit come out?  You're fucking sissy. 
[04:16:00]  Are you giving yourself a good one?  Or are you giving yourself a bad blowjob?  Exactly.  Are you sucking it just to put your mouth on it?  Why is jerking off okay?  It's just for a bit of a jerk.  You know what?  I just realized jerking off is for pleasure.  You want to cum.  Sucking your own dick is for pleasure.  Yes, but the thing is jerking your dick is like, there's a, there's really a, it's no pleasure.  You're trying to get to an end.  Sorry, sorry.  You're like, you're looking at a pussy. 
[04:16:30]  You just suck your dick and then stop.  And you're pretending that it's a puss.  And you're looking and you're just jerking your fucking dick.  Patrice makes a good point here.  Patrice, if you suck your own dick, do you suck it like you're jerking it off?  Like, hey, I'm just going to suck it just to make sure my cum comes out.  You got to keep your eyes closed and maybe cry a little bit.  And you make mmm sounds.  Like a bitch.  You're sucking your dick like a bitch or like a dude who's jerking off. 
[04:17:00]  When you jerk off, when you jerk off, do you do it like a girl would jerk you off?  Are you trying to be sensuous with your own cock?  Or are you just pounding your meat until you come?  How much do you hate a bitch trying to jerk you off?  It's senseless.  When they try to jerk you off and it's just like, okay, it's a idiot.  It's like, let me do it.  The second I'm ready to come, you grab it and fucking just do the last couple of sucks.  I will give you the credit.  You take the credit.  How do you eat it?  You get the collar.  It's kind of like going fishing with your dad. 
[04:17:30]  He caught the fish and then you reel it in.  How do you create a style to suck your own dick?  We can't do it.  That's why it sounds so crazy.  None of us can do it.  If we could do it, we can't answer that.  The rarity.  For us, it's foreign because it's such a rarity.  But if you could, would you do it well?  If I could.  At 13 years old or 12 years old, if you said to somebody, will you jerk off, they'd probably  go, no, I wouldn't.  When you're a kid, you never want to admit you jerk off or that you would.  It's incomprehensible.  Well, as adults, that's still the way dick sucking is to us because we never learned to do it. 
[04:18:00]  Patrice, very famous story on this show.  My brother sucked his own dick as a kid.  And he's not gay.  He's not a gay dude.  And he explained it this way.  He goes, I wanted to get one.  I didn't want to give one.  Yeah, that's a good point.  You do it for pleasure.  When you jerk off, are you thinking, wow, I got a big dick in my...  No, you're going, oh, this feels good.  Boy, this one's a wobbly one.  The feeling of the cock in your hand...  The feeling of the cock in your hand is overridden by the feeling of being jerked. 
[04:18:30]  So I'm imagining being sucked...  Let me tell you something.  When I jerk my dick, I don't even pay attention to my dick.  Right.  My hand and my dick are inconsequential to the fact that I'm looking at something or thinking  about something and jerking off.  But the act of sucking your own dick is no thought.  You are sucking your own dick.  But we can't do it.  You don't have to be paying attention to that shit.  Sometimes I put love beads up my ass while I wank.  Is that gay?  And then yank them off just as I'm coming.  No.  We must establish you're gay, Jim.  You're already out of the picture, man. 
[04:19:00]  David in Tennessee, what's up?  Hey, fellas, what's going on?  The great Ron Jeremy says sucking your own dick feels incredibly good.  Right up to the point you realize you have a dick in your mouth.  Well, Ron does a lot of funny things.  Hey, if I can make an observation here.  Who's that?  I have no idea.  Listening on hold is so much different than on the radio.  Fly on the wall is amazing just to hear it on hold.  Why?  What's the difference?  What's the difference?  I don't know.  You feel like you're listening in on something you're not supposed to listen into. 
[04:19:30]  It's a weird...  You get a little tee-hee.  Yeah, it's cool.  All right, David.  By the way, I wanted to make an announcement.  We're starting to get the lineups together for the ONA Traveling Virus Comedy Show.  And, of course, you know, you know.  I would love to.  We're going to see if we can get you guys.  We'll call it a tour.  Your name came up a lot yesterday, Jim Jefferies. 
[04:20:00]  Oh, thank you.  And, of course, Patrice.  I mean, that doesn't have to be said.  Of course.  But we're starting to get the lineups together.  We can do a double like me and you called Guy Not Gay.  Yeah, we can just perform on the same mic.  Right.  All right.  Oh, we got Gavin's audio.  Clean.  So listen to this.  So, once again, this is Gavin, our friend, filming his buddy getting a strap-on up his ass  from a hooker in a hotel room.  They're all together.  We're all together.  In your bum hole. 
[04:20:30]  Oh, boy, that's it.  Okay, so we've got Wayne, the job, and Mrs. Gildred, going away.  And Lloyd, he's just going to get involved there. 
[04:21:00]  Let me just get this one.  Don't put it on me.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Where's that phone?  That's it.  That's it.  I don't think I'm going to shit one.  Oh, oh.  What's going on?  Ah, ah. 
[04:21:30]  Oh, oh, oh.  Ah, ah.  Oh, fucking God.  What is it?  Come on.  Wow, is it nice?  Is it, uh?  It's like my fucking eyes.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Ah.  Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck it up.  Oh, that was going to be, what the fuck was it?  Oh, do you like shit?  Yeah.  Oh, I can't lie.  Do you see that? 
[04:22:00]  Give me a towel, because if he's covered in shit, I don't want it all over me.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  You might still be all over the cup.  Oh, shit.  Well, I'll stick up to you.  Yeah, I'll stick up to you guys as well.  Oh, it's maybe there.  Oh, it's maybe there.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  It's better than it.  Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ah, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, ah, ah.  Oh, fuck it up.  Ah, ha, ha.  Um, yes! 
[04:22:30]  Yes!  Oh, God!  I might have to figure that out.  Well, get in there and fuck him out behind there.  It's a lot more fun.  Get in there and give it a good ride.  No, come on, because I don't want to talk too much.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  There you go.  Get in there later.  It is fucking riding.  Good lad, good lad. That's what I'm talking about. 
[04:23:00]  That's what I'm talking about.  That's what I'm talking about.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh! 
[04:23:30]  Oh, fucking hell!  There was a moment where I started to get an erection.  I'm not kidding you.  Oh, my God.  That's fucking horny, man.  That's okay.  That bitch going, I got shit all over me to get a towel.  I was like, that's fucking hot, man.  He shit all over a strap on dildo.  Patrice under his breath.  What's wrong, Patrice?  He's calling Jimmy a piece of shit.  Why?  Because it smells, but that's the way the fucking room probably smelled.  This is like a new thing in the future.  Oh!  Oh!  Smell a radio.  Yeah.  It's like scratching stiff.  Fucking Gavin laughing to the whole thing just kills me.  Oh!  Oh!  That's what I'm talking about. 
[04:24:00]  He was just taking it.  Is that McCain's wife in the red?  Yeah.  Huh?  Fucking hot broad.  Yeah, McCain's wife's alright.  She's like Amy Pollard.  Oh, broad.  Fuck that.  Jeez.  Look at this little Halle Berry fucking...  Fucking hell.  Oh!  What is she...  You want to do?  Hey, let's uh...  That's great.  Listen to this orgasm.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah! 
[04:24:30]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  There's just something in his ass.  How would you like to come like that?  Can you play...  Is there something in his ass?  Could you play the famous one?  Where...  It was uh...  Guess the sound?  I...  I don't want to give it away.  Where uh...  Oh, right, right, right.  Do you have it there?  With the ee-ha guy?  Yeah.  I have it?  I think so.  Here's uh...  Tom Sizemore from his uh...  Porno movie that he did.  Oh! 
[04:25:00]  Oh!  Mother...  Fuck!  Yeah!  Little Asian uh...  Woman...  Um...  Getting shit on.  That should be their national anthem.  They fucking love it.  The unhappier the girl is, the fucking happier the girl is.  Oh, yeah.  The Japanese are mental when it comes to it.  Oh, yeah.  They're sick.  I'm telling you.  I watch it.  They pixelate the cock, but they don't pixelate the shit.  No, the pubic hair. 
[04:25:30]  Yeah, and the dog's cock is fine to have in there.  You know, it's...  Horrible.  Horrible stuff.  It's all...  It's all rape, and it's all tying up and...  Pedophilia.  Yeah.  It's all...  All dressed like school kids and stuff.  It's a fucking horrible...  It's a World War losing thing.  I'm telling you, because Germany is the same way.  Yeah.  It's...  It's got something to do when your country concedes a World War.  The whole fucking psyche of the nation goes down.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  That makes...  No, the porn in Japan is fucking...  Even I go, it's fucking sick, man.  It's just shit coming out on her. 
[04:26:00]  You hear it crackling.  Yeah, you hear the crackling of the...  Pudding.  Do you guys want to...  Of the sausage.  That fucking chocolate mousse crackle.  Hey, you're listening to Opie and Anthony, and if you're not listening to him, you might  be deaf or retarded, and just have the radio on, and just be looking at it, staring,  and nothing's really computing in.  But you wouldn't be offended by this, you can't hear me either.  All right, let me unzip.  I'm kind of suspicious, because your relationship ended just in time for prom season.  What's that about?  Well, you know, I like getting in a limo. 
[04:26:30]  I like a nice limo ride.  Dude, please go to a prom this year.  You want me to go to a prom?  Please go to a prom.  There's got to be one 17-year-old girl out there that needs a prom date.  What girl wants to go to a prom?  I'll take a prom.  That'd be the start.  It's a hacky radio bit.  I should go to a prom.  But please.  It wouldn't be a radio bit.  A radio bit.  That's what I'm saying.  That's why we would actually think about doing it.  How horrible would that be?  The father beats me up, because I'm fucking pounding his girl in the backseat. 
[04:27:00]  On tomorrow's?  That's awful.  Tomorrow's show, we're going to have potential dates call you.  Only a prom date, though.  We're not looking for any other...  That's a prom date.  Hi, Anthony.  I don't have a date for the prom.  You'll take care of all that on your own.  We're looking for a prom date for you, though.  A prom date?  I bet you there's one or two listeners that would actually do this.  Yeah.  But they have to put out.  They have to put out.  In the ass.  Yeah.  You have to open up your ass for it. 
[04:27:30]  There's no putting out.  That's right.  You've got to give Anthony the stinky mushroom.  That's fucking like...  You've got to give up the brown eye for Anthony.  If you want to...  You've got to let him shoot potato...  I've got to give you two words.  Hey, you'll let the Cheerio and...  Right in the tailpipe.  The fucking tailpipe.  That's all.  Got to let him cram potatoes by the tailpipe.  Pull it out, put potato flakes all over your rink knuckle.  Stink wrinkle.  Rink knuckle?  Whatever.  No, he called it the...  A rink knuckle?  Yeah, he called it the stink knuckle. 
[04:28:00]  Stink wrinkle.  The asshole is the tailpipe.  Potato flakes is...  Yeah, you're dried cum.  He's the worst, man.  I love that guy.  I love him.  He had a million of them.  Sewer.  Oh, I can't remember.  We have to...  We've said in the past, we've got to get a montage of all those.  Just throw them together.  You've got to give Anthony a rusty trombone with Chuck Mangione playing in the background.  Yeah.  And accurately play it.  Dude, I think there would actually be a girl that we'll call tomorrow and see if you're 
[04:28:30]  serious about this prom thing.  Would you do it?  Yeah, I would go to the...  What if we made it 18 so you don't get arrested?  So there's some girls that are already 18.  17 in New York according to...  Legal?  Well, according to ageofconsent.com.  Oh, my God.  That's how you know you're a piece of shit if you have that bookmark.  If you have that...  Yeah, right?  Let me just...  No, that's your home page.  Just in case.  So we got our animation contest and now we got the open up your ass for Anthony contest, 
[04:29:00]  which we'll start tomorrow.  Open up...  16 in New Jersey for anybody who has a Jersey prom.  How do you know this?  That was a bit I was doing.  Oh, okay.  You were researching a bit.  I was researching a bit.  Yeah.  It's called living as a pederast.  That's it.  Yeah, and Pete Townsend was researching a book. 
[04:29:30]  All right.  We got lots of contests to do tomorrow.  Open up your ass for Anthony and we got to start talking about our animation festival.  Animationpalooza, I think it's called.  Yes, I like animation.  Well, animation festival is going to be the...  That's going to be the working...  Animapalooza, I don't know.  Animation festival is going to be the...  Cartoonapalooza, that was it.  It's going to be the working name.  Yeah.  It's not going to be the official name.  Cartoonapalooza.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  You have to go to a prom.  You have to.  Oh, my God.  And this is what it is. 
[04:30:00]  A girl's got to be legal, depending on what state that you go to the prom, and she has  to put out a little.  No, what is a little?  Just a little.  What is that?  Like, you get to, like, squeeze her little boobie.  And I'm going to be squeezing any boobie.  You have to squeeze her little boobie.  How horrible is it for a...  And you don't even have to go under her dress or anything, just on the outside.  Like, let's negotiate with these girls.  But I have to come over, though, and as the parents have taken pictures, I got a pin  of corsage on her.  Yes.  But she has to agree that later on the night, when Mommy and Daddy are gone, you get to squeeze 
[04:30:30]  her boobie a little bit.  And maybe touch the top of Patch.  I can't touch the top of Patch.  Well, we got to negotiate.  It doesn't work like that.  I guarantee we'll find a girl that is dead serious about taking you to their prom.  There's something called date rape.  If not, if she agrees.  Yeah, even if she agrees.  If she doesn't want to.  Huh?  It's date rape.  You don't want to get into there, do you?  Hey, what are you, a mind reader? 
[04:31:00]  Oh, I guess we found a subject that Dan's ready to talk about.  Jesus Christ.  We've been throwing lobs at you all day.  You finally hit one back.  All right, Dan.  Let's get into this a little bit.  Lord Shire Horse says.  Isn't it Horst?  We forgot that guy's name right, Jimmy.  Lord Shire Horse.  Shire Horse says there's a girl available for the Daddy Daughter Dance if anyone is interested.  Daddy Daughter Dance. 
[04:31:30]  How about she has to touch your giant hog through your tuxedo?  No!  That's...  No!  Why?  Oh, God.  I'm just helping a brother out here.  Pretty embarrassing.  Tim W. from Rochester, the home of Brother Wheeze, always will be.  He writes, Anthony prom equals pink sock hop.  All right, we got so much to talk about and think of. 
[04:32:00]  Yeah.  Think about it for tomorrow's show.  Open up your Ask for Anthony contest starts tomorrow officially.  I don't think...  Let me...  I'm just gonna...  What?  Go off on a limb here and say I don't think we're really gonna get many contestants if that's  the name of the contest.  Huh?  I don't think we're gonna get a lot of takers.  Because if it's a prom thing, then you're talking, you know, girl with the parents and 
[04:32:30]  if it's open up your ass...  Jimmy, do you have a problem with the name of the contest?  Yeah, I think it should be open up your asshole.  I think open up your ass is too vague.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  Too much.  Too fucking much.  You really have a problem with the name?  That's weird.  Well...  Voss must have a daughter that's doing the prom this year.  Yes, I spent some time talking with the Voss daughters at one of the... 
[04:33:00]  That was the most uncomfortable thing I've ever experienced.  Oh, was Rich just infuriated?  Oh.  He was so pissed.  I got her phone number and Rich just was funny.  He wanted to punch me.  He wanted to punch me in the head.  Like I wasn't ever gonna use it.  But it was just funny because I knew it annoyed the shit out of Rich.  True.  I was offering her drinks.  I was offering her booths.  There was a bit of realism there.  I was standing right there. 
[04:33:30]  I was like...  Just talking.  By the way, yes, I'm sorry, Shea, and to everybody else that have been with us a long  time.  Shea from Connecticut writes, come on, Ant.  Remember how much better everything is when you put teen in front of it.  So it really should be open up your teen ass.  Hole.  Hole.  Thank you, Ant.  Jimmy's rule.  All right.  So now we're up to open up your teen ass pause hole for Anthony contest.  Can't possibly work. 
[04:34:00]  We can't get contestants for the change thing.  So we're up to open up your teen ass hole.  Open up your teen asshole for me.  No, no, no.  Make sure you got the pause in there, Jimmy.  Or how about, um, if it's too long to put that on a flyer, how about this?  Uh, prom cunt.  How about prom cunt?  You're the winner of the prom cunt contest, which means you get to get me, Anthony Cumia, 
[04:34:30]  a big celebrity with an even bigger cock and huger bank account, to take you, the pig,  to your prom.  The first prize is you drink a load out of my balls.  That's also second and third prize.  Fourth prize is you get your ass and pussy fucked in that order.  All right.  We're on to some, Ant.  Ant, bear with us.  We're on to something here.  I drop you off at the end of the evening with a fucking, with a load stuck to your back  and your fucking, your stupid needing money father comes out and cleans my cock off with 
[04:35:00]  your mother's wedding gown.  At least the strapless dress will, at least the strapless dress will stay on after all  that cum on your back.  All right, Ant.  Prom cunt.  Ant, are you in one?  Brought to you by the Opie and Anthony program.  Ant, are you in?  People are very excited.  They're typing in caps at this point.  This will never work.  That's right.  And you have to do a special dance.  Right.  You get to do a fucking, you get to slow dance with this slob after a Cialis with your  big dick pressing against her while they play the chicken dance at the prom. 
[04:35:30]  And you slow dance with this fucking manatee.  Yeah.  Oh shit.  Prom cunt.  She gets, you know what she has to do?  She has to fucking drain a load out of your balls and then go fucking knuckle deep in  your asshole.  Fucking her father gets to smell the fingers for extra money and guess which one was in  your ass.  And if he, if he guesses, if he guesses right, you don't punch his daughter in the face.  Prom cunt. 
[04:36:00]  Sponsored by XM satellite radio.  Void where prohibited.  We're definitely on to something.  Oh shit.  More suggestions coming in instead of open up your teen ass hole for Anthony contest.  Uh, they're suggesting that we adjusted just slightly and, and, uh, and rename it.  How the fuck did it go? 
[04:36:30]  Uh, all right.  Get the pin of corsage on right into her fat torso.  So you just stick it right into her.  You just, what you do is you fucking put a safety pin through a plastic flower.  Yeah.  And you just fucking palm it right into her fat tit.  Yeah.  What do you say?  There you go, slobo.  You might have.  Come on, slobo.  Time to head to the dance.  Oh shit.  Oh shit.  Maybe you can roll a marble on the dance floor and then hit her on the back and she'll  eat it like Hungry Hungry Hippo.  That's the fucking prom song you dance to. 
[04:37:00]  Hungry Hungry Hippo.  Then you fucking, you stick your dick right in her shitter in the parking lot and dad picks  her up.  She has to fucking sit on her side.  She can't even sit properly.  On the fucking side bone.  How was it?  What's up?  Let's, uh, let's Google bomb the name of this contest.  So we get a little, uh, so it has some legs.  The only thing, and you might have to come up with like, um, first semester, uh, tuition 
[04:37:30]  for a college, but that's easy.  You fucking wear a white, a white tuxedo, a white tuxedo to show the fucking damage on  the front.  You want her father just by the colors on the front of it to know how many holes you got  in.  Well, I see a clear crustacean mixed with red, but no brown.  Thank God.  My girl, she kept her on a, she saved her asshole.  Douglas, uh, from Austin writes, my daughter was demolished by Anthony Tuesday. 
[04:38:00]  Well, here's, uh, Don, the trucker.  He writes, uh, open up your teen ass hole.  Very good with the dot, dot, dot.  Thank you, Don.  And give Mel Carmers in a heart attack contest.  I fucking like that, man.  Yeah.  What do you say?  Are you in?  You gotta be in.  You want to, you want to sleep on it?  You know, run it, run it past Logan.  Yeah.  See what he thinks about that.  See how that goes past that.  That's right. 
[04:38:30]  And as a special bonus, when the fucking millionaire comes to pick up your fucking white trash daughter,  your wife can suck his balls and then wipe her fucking brow with his pubes.  What do you think of that?  You fucking cuckold.  You cuckold.  And the millionaire will throw a few bucks at you.  And you, you and your wife can both fish around on the linoleum for them.  The way Sonny threw the money down at the camera, Anthony could throw a few fucking tens down.  Oh.  Here you go.  Fetch.  Oh, shit. 
[04:39:00]  I found those legs.  I found the line, by the way.  We just, uh, just in the first word of the contest to pull open your teen ass hole for Anthony.  Contest.  Oh.  It's very, it's a subtle change, but I think it gets the point across.  Well, pull open implies that she's putting her hands in her ass cheeks and like using  her middle fingers from each one and just grabbing the cheek and physically opening  it harshly.  Right.  You know, the way one would fucking, uh, what would you open?  You know, when you try to open a new piece of electronics, it comes in that fucking hard 
[04:39:30]  plastic shell.  Yes.  You finally get a knife in there and you have to position your, your, your fingers in there  pull.  Like that's how you're going to open your fucking.  Yes.  Your frightened prom asshole.  Supposed to be the biggest night of your life.  And you're going home with a millionaire's load and your fucking pubes.  What do you think of that?  This big night.  Take your fucking, take your corsage out and fucking vomit.  Yeah.  So we get, we'll need an answer.  You can sleep on it. 
[04:40:00]  Oh.  All right.  All right.  It's either that or, uh, or, uh, Black Panther hunting.  No, there's no Black Panther hunting.  That's great.  All right.  So you're open to this idea, right?  Oh.  Oh yeah.  This will go over.  And she's fat.  So we have to put a little thing around her and we'll call it a cumberbunt.  Open your hole for Anthony's pole contest.  Uh, Stig.  Stig.  Yes.  Uh.  Ream your teen contest.  Three line Jim C.  Uh, well, dry blood is suggesting we go with the contest. 
[04:40:30]  Uh, we name it the cock of love.  It has to be a prom theme.  Yeah.  Of course.  It certainly does.  Jimmy.  Mm.  Mm.  All right.  Good.  I think we're up to something.  Yeah.  Prom rapist.  Prom rapist.  Where you can, you have to be 18 or older to enter, but you can, you can enter for a  chance to win a brutal assault on your prom night by fucking Anthony in the limo in your 
[04:41:00]  driveway.  And then he fucking speeds off in his Shelby.  Or you show up at your own prom with a black eye.  Yeah.  Cause he really has better things to do than hang out with you all night.  You show up with a black eye and try to make the most of it.  Your fifth wheel.  Yeah.  You'll, you'll spend all day getting all pretty.  You'll spend all day getting ready for your prom.  And it's only going to be with you for five minutes.  That's right.  The Shelby will still be running.  That's right.  A nice assault right in the limo in your fucking.  That's right.  Right in your driveway. 
[04:41:30]  While your parents wave stupidly.  Right.  They have no idea what's going on in the backseat.  Boy, they sure are in the driveway for a long time.  And they fucking see the window crack.  And they have a feeling it might've been your head getting smashed against it on the inside,  but they're not sure.  Right.  Holy shit.  All right.  We got to decide on a name.  We got to decide on a name because my bros are ready to go into production with the t-shirts.  Oh my God.  So what are we going with?  Pull open?  Sick motherfucker. 
[04:42:00]  What is going to be on the t-shirt?  Pull open?  We haven't figured out.  Brother Elmo, we need a t-shirt for this.  It's brilliant.  It's brilliant in how simple it is.  The Milk Anthony's pole contest?  Milk Anthony like a cow?  Yeah.  It just isn't going to fucking work.  Why?  What seems to be the problem?  Everything.  We could adjust the name a little bit.  A little?  Yeah, but you know.  Oh God.  That's right. 
[04:42:30]  We'll give it a little bit on the name, but the rest of it we got to be tough about.  I'm going to be fucking laughing.  I'm going to be fucking laughing.  And bring your appetite.  Bring your appetite.  You're going to be sucking a lot of clothes.  That's right.  Maybe we could just call it your special night.  Right.  But it's so sarcastic.  All right.  Because your special night.  Well, special in quotations.  Your special night.  Yeah.  It fucking, you'd never make it into the dance.  You're fucking, you're drinking Anthony's goat cheese.  Yeah.  In the fucking, in the back of the limo.  Let's, let's get a rider together and make her the only girl that sucks cock on the dance 
[04:43:00]  floor while everyone else is slow dancing around her.  Yeah.  You have to, you have to service Anthony on the dance floor.  On the dance floor while everyone else is thinking that they're in love.  While they're all dancing and falling in love.  Right.  You have to hold fucking cocktail Franks in one hand.  Right.  And blow the millionaire.  That's right.  Cocktail Franks in your hand.  And it's a giant hog.  So you're not going to be able to hide what you're doing from anyone.  Why cocktail Franks? 
[04:43:30]  Because we said so.  That's right.  Pigs in a blanket.  Yeah.  Pigs in a blanket.  Cocktail weenies, fatty.  Hold them.  I can't fucking take this.  Just so your fingers smell like hot dog Franks on the way home.  And you know, and this will show how good we are.  We're good guys here.  We will supply the diaper after Anthony ruins your ass.  So you can enjoy the rest of the prom.  Right.  Without fucking butterscotching your new dress.  No one wants to butterscotch all the fucking, all your prom song is playing. 
[04:44:00]  Your date can meet you there.  After Kumia wrecks you in the fucking limo, you can get out and see your stupid senior date.  Right.  If he stands there with a fucking corsage, a flower to hand you.  Yeah.  And a goofy emo look.  Exactly.  But he should be handing you his fucking Oxycontin and anal stitches.  All right, Ant.  We're, we're so onto something here. 
[04:44:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're onto something.  All right.  Did you write all that down, Dan?  Oh, yeah.  Dan wrote it all down.  Oh, God.  We're gonna, we're gonna run it by, uh, Washington.  We got no room for fucking, no, no vague language in this contest.  Yeah, please.  We insist.  This has to be.  We insist on this one.  We want the lawyers to approve this one.  We're not willing to budge.  That's right.  We're not willing to budge on this one.  We're not willing to budge on this one.  We've budged enough over the years.  This, this is one they need to give to us.  Well, how about chocolate prom?  At the end, at the end of the night, for your prize, you fucking lay back in the limo 
[04:45:00]  and fucking Kumia drops a shit right in your mouth and then leaves without an explanation.  Pac-2 from Philly writes, the deep dick under the sea pants.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We got some potential with chocolate prom.  Absolutely.  You all right with this, Ant?  Oh, yeah. 
[04:45:30]  Just run it past Washington.  All right.  We'll run it.  It'll go off really well.  We're gonna, we're gonna hope that they blue sky this by Wednesday.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure it will be.  I'm sure we'll have to let it bake for a day or two, but after that, we should be good  to go.  All right.  I'm gonna be laughing all fucking day because of Jimmy.  I'm Anthony Kumia and I approve this message.  Do it!  Hey, it's Opie from the Opie and Anthony show.  By now, you probably know that Anthony is single. 
[04:46:00]  He broke up with his girl right around prom season.  I think Anthony wants to go to a prom.  Bring Anthony to your prom.  We're looking for women out there that would consider taking Anthony to their prom.  You can be Anthony's prom date.  Send a picture to us.  Where?  I don't know because I don't have like someone's email in front of me.  But I think voice guy will tell you where to send your picture.  Call 866-FU-LINE-1 if you're interested in being Anthony's prom date.  I think Anthony wants to go to a prom.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  It's a prom date with Anthony. 
[04:46:30]  And please be 18 or older.  Thank you.  Over and out.  Now I gotta cut loose.  Put loose.  Can we go with the sudden death shoes?  Hey, we got something that's been making its way around one of the fan sites.  I don't know which one I would give you credit.  But the Quincy clip.  Oh.  See, Jimmy does Jim C, obviously.  Jim C.  Which is based on Quincy, obviously.  Loosely based on the Quincy character's Jim C, which is exactly like Quincy.  There have been similarities. 
[04:47:00]  People have pointed out.  Yeah.  No fingerprint expert.  He has certain weird clipped words.  Yeah.  Clips.  Clip.  I guess the next stage of this bit, people are finding Quincy clips that they think are  ridiculous or funny or whatever.  And it's not supposed to be funny because it was a drama.  It was a drama.  No one really realizes that this show had credibility.  It was a serious show.  And it was on the heels of the odd couple.  It was after he had left the odd couple as Oscar Madison.  So it was kind of odd to see him in a drama. 
[04:47:30]  There was some comedic moments and comedy elements throughout the thing.  But basically, it was supposed to be like a serious show.  Right.  And at the time, I don't know how, but it was.  He would.  Now, you listen back and it's like, this is horrible.  This stinks.  And when Quincy would talk, he would take his thumb and he would take the other four fingers.  Picture going, mamma mia.  Right, right.  The way you do your fingers from mamma mia.  Yeah.  That's how he would talk. 
[04:48:00]  Like he would.  Even when he was just talking casually.  He's a harder guy to do when he's not angry.  Yeah.  He's wearing a dick sweater or some fucking Iranian president members only jacket.  And is this the punk rock clip?  Yeah.  He wants to talk to a bunch of punk rockers.  This stinks.  It's it's almost a parody of a show that stinks.  Oh, yeah.  It's so completely bad.  He's in a punk rock bar.  Do you want to play the first clip, even though it's slightly long?  I mean, the punk rock clips are the big get here.  Oh, yeah. 
[04:48:30]  But the first clip is funny because the the the the over the top caring is like, why would  you care about the answer?  Oh, right.  It's the one we listened to earlier.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's start with this clip from Quincy way back in the day.  And then we'll get to the punk, the punk club.  Punk clips.  Punk.  I could blow up even bigger if you want points.  Oh, thanks.  I can blow up the size of an elevator.  We still wouldn't get a clear print out of it.  Clear print out of it.  Clear print.  Clear print.  Clear print.  This isn't my day.  It's not your day.  What problems are you having? 
[04:49:00]  It's overlapping fits we found on the ice.  That was some of Steve's acting right there.  Not your day.  That was his fucking awful boss.  John Astin, his real name was, I think?  I don't know.  Was it?  He had that fucking dumb mustache.  What was his name?  How'd your parents die?  Yeah.  I don't know.  We haven't done an autopsy.  You could blow it up as big as an elephant.  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  I'm not going to get a clear print print.  Clear print.  Clear print.  Listen to the Steve actor by the other guy.  This isn't my day.  It's not your day.  What problems are you having?  It's overlapping fits we found on the ice brick. 
[04:49:30]  These?  Yeah.  What about them?  We blow them up.  Hoping to squeeze some more information out of them, but no such luck.  You know, Quincy, maybe there is a way to unscramble these prints.  It's like trying to put the toothpaste back into the tube.  There isn't a fingerprint man alive who'll get a positive ID based on what's here.  Not a man, but a machine, maybe.  Machine?  I had visions of buying one until I looked at the price.  Remember that computer show I went to in May?  At the convention center?  Yeah.  Who cares where it was?  At the convention center? 
[04:50:00]  No, no, the arena.  You sure?  Because I remember the one at the convention center.  Right.  Who cares where it was?  A computer show at the convention center?  What do they have?  One computer?  Yeah, one computer.  See, because they were real large back then.  That's my large computer joke.  It was so bad, the information they were giving.  It was too pricey back in May.  Yeah.  Who gives a fuck?  Just a machine?  A machine?  A computer?  A machine?  I was going to get one, but it was a little too pricey.  Oh, you were a Jew. 
[04:50:30]  So because it was too pricey, there's like dozens of murders they're not going to solve.  Yeah.  Too pricey.  I'll try to do it the old fashioned way and save a few bucks.  We would have fingerprints, Sam, but the boss is a jerk.  That's right.  This guy never saw a penny that he didn't like.  We can't get a clear print.  A clear print.  I bet we could get clear prints off a penny from your pocket.  A pocket.  You're a Jew.  That's it.  Quincy's an anti-Semite. 
[04:51:00]  There's six million of them, Sam, and they're hiding somewhere.  Bobby Fischer was right.  The whole thing was a lie.  They were never murdered.  Tom, wait a minute.  Thomas Overbeck from Dallas.  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking crime lab.  You're in my...  Quincy!  This plot was murdered. 
[04:51:30]  Here, let's go back to this clip.  At the convention center?  Yeah.  Quincy, they had a graphics computer that could take two combined pictures and separate the images.  No.  Do you remember who was displaying it?  But I was too cheap to buy it.  Too cheap.  Oy vey, Quincy.  Right.  Do you remember who was displaying it?  Comtow.  Maybe I'll just give them a call. 
[04:52:00]  Pick up some modern computer equipment there, huh?  Help Quincy out.  It could actually separate two sets of fingerprints and play pong at the same time.  Yeah.  That's awful.  So then Quincy, in this particular episode, he goes to a punk rock club.  Yeah.  And he convinces the punk rock club manager to let him go on stage and talk to the youth.  He wanted to talk to the kids.  But is the part where he's trying to convince them, if I could just convince them. 
[04:52:30]  And the fuck, he's wearing this shit dick sweater.  Yeah.  And the manager stinks.  Go ahead.  It's so bad.  Good luck.  If you want to, good luck with that.  And the punk rock kids are, not kids, first of all.  Right out of central casting, as they like to say.  Just awful.  The dialogue.  Hey, man.  Right.  They're just really not convincing.  They look like they have Halloween costumes on.  Yeah.  It looks like now how you would Halloween dress as a punk. 
[04:53:00]  Right.  Of course.  Well, they can't have real punk rockers on TV.  That would scare the shit out of everybody.  It was wholesome TV back then.  So this is the edgiest they could get if they have a punk rock character.  But look at how fucking fast the music shuts down.  They're all quiet.  Listen, there's nothing not awful about this.  It's amazing how they took awfulness and they just stretched it over a bunch of moments.  Wasn't punk rock all about, fuck the establishment.  Yeah.  Establishment. 
[04:53:30]  As soon as Quincy walks on, obviously, like, he's the establishment.  Oh, the music shuts down.  Everyone is quiet immediately.  They'd be like, what the fuck?  Wouldn't you just start throwing chairs at the man?  I wish it was a Gigi Allen show.  Right.  You could shit in Quincy's face.  Fucking shit out of banana.  He just shoved up his ass into Quincy's mouth.  Him and his brother Merle would have homosexual relations, Sam.  He's pissing on the crowd.  Gigi.  A Gigi Allen show.  Fucking Gigi rules.  I want to talk to the murder junkies. 
[04:54:00]  The murder junkies.  The murder junkies.  The murder junkies.  Here's something about Gigi.  Oh, yeah.  Could we stop the music?  You hate me and I hate you.  He's throwing feces at me, Sam.  And the things I say I do.  So what?  No.  You never liked me, so I said fuck you.  Yeah.  You know, you know.  Quincy tapping his foot, singing along.  Fuck you.  And fuck you.  Quincy's shoving a banana up his ass and then throwing it at the audience. 
[04:54:30]  With those stupid Mamma Mia fingers.  Mamma Mia fingers.  Looks like the Italian guy on a pizza box.  Yeah, exactly what it is.  If I could just talk to him.  Everything's an intense moment.  How about this?  You give us an autopsy report and then go fuck cardboard ass.  Cardboard ass.  Because that's all you're supposed to do.  Exactly.  The coroner isn't going out investigating at some punk rock club.  Of course he's not.  He's a coroner.  He's a cop.  He's a lover.  He's an alcoholic. 
[04:55:00]  He rubs his fucking dirty balls on his boss's awful mustache.  And he fingers Lieutenant Monaghan's ass when he's fucking tired.  He's a busy man, that Quincy.  They play let's check the prostate.  We both know what it's about.  Sticks his whole hand in there with his Mamma Mia hand.  Five fingers go up there.  I'm going to fist you.  Here we go.  This is Quincy talking to the punk rock club manager before he goes on stage.  It's great.  We need your help.  I want to go on stage for two minutes and talk to the kids. 
[04:55:30]  Maybe you'd like to take over to the opening act.  You paint a target on your head, I might arrange it.  I want to find an innocent girl.  You look for an innocent girl.  Yeah.  Is it too much to ask for a few minutes to try to save a life?  Hey, be my guest.  But if you expect any of these kids to help you out, you've got another guest coming.  Go ahead.  This should be fun.  That's punk rock by the way.  Go ahead.  This should be fun.  It sounds like...  I am rock quarry.  And listen to the music that's supposed to represent punk rock. 
[04:56:00]  Yeah, that was the punk rock band playing in the background.  See, they can't even commit because it's stupid TV.  It's just some kind of easy listening rock.  Kind of like Dwayne Allman or something.  It's not punk.  No, that was punk, man.  I want to help an innocent girl.  Girl.  And the guy is like, well, baby, you've got another guest coming if you think those kids.  It's like they took everyone who auditioned and started from the bottom up like the worst actor got the game.  No, then you heard.  Well, what are you going to say when you go up there? 
[04:56:30]  If that's the guy that got it, how bad were the ones that didn't?  What did they say?  No, that's no good.  You didn't speak English.  It was close.  All right.  We'll give him a call back.  All right.  Here's Quincy trying to talk to the kids from the stage, man.  Please tell me the music.  The awful music stops.  I think so.  Yeah.  Please.  Can I be attached to please?  It's very important.  There you go.  Wow.  Dead silent.  Wow.  Just like that.  Not shut the fuck up. 
[04:57:00]  Yeah.  Who are you?  Put the music back on, asshole.  Yeah.  What happened to fuck the man?  Please.  Can I be attached to please?  It's very important.  Oh, God.  Thank you.  Thank you.  How many of you know Abigail Garvin?  Garvin.  How many of you know that the police are looking for in connection with a murder that happened  right here in front of this stage?  Now, all the charges against her have been dropped.  She's innocent.  If she comes back, nothing will be done to her.  Why should we believe you?  Jesus. 
[04:57:30]  If I knew who that girl was, I sure as hell wouldn't tell a cop.  Because that's all you are, man.  It's a dog without a uniform.  I don't care what kind of names you call me.  Call me.  This is so fucking bad.  I don't care what kind of names you call me.  Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah.  I'm rubbing your glue.  Sticks and stones can break my bones.  That's right.  But names will never hurt that girl.  I don't care what kind of names you call me.  You can call me a coroner. 
[04:58:00]  You can call me a sloppy sports reporter.  Just over the top acting.  Call me a flat ass fucker.  Right.  If she comes back, nothing will be done to her.  Why should we believe you?  If I knew who that girl was, I sure as hell wouldn't tell a cop.  Because that's all you are, man.  It's a dog without a uniform.  I don't care what kind of names you call me.  I'm only interested in helping Abby.  This is right out of a John Wayne movie.  That guy's got to laugh.  Is there four people in the club?  That guy's killing.  Yeah, there's like 20 people. 
[04:58:30]  Big crazy club.  Yeah.  You're just a dog without a uniform.  I don't care what kind of names you call me.  Names you call me.  I'm an asshole.  Is it just the worst?  I'm rubbing your glue.  Sam has tiny genitals.  Look, we have reason to believe that she's with Zach's real murderer, Molly Howard,  and Molly is trying to push her into a codeine overdose.  So please, if you have any information.  That's a crock, mister.  You think we're all zombie killers.  You're the killers.  You're the killers. 
[04:59:00]  Your whole sick society.  That's who's guilty, man.  We're just your lousy scapegoat.  Besides, man.  The scapegoat?  Who the hell cares?  And Clint leaves the stage.  Dejected.  Moping.  And unsuccessful.  Oh, wow.  Oh.  Mamma Mia hands in pocket.  And he gives all the details.  Molly Howard is trying to push her into a codeine overdose.  Yeah.  What?  They would just be sitting there going, what?  An extra aspirin? 
[04:59:30]  I mean, wow.  Codeine overdose?  What?  That's outrageous, huh?  Whoa, hey.  Molly Howard is trying to get her to take Tylenol PM.  She's giving her melatonin.  Instead of regular Tylenol, it's Tylenol PM.  It's just horrid dialogue.  She's taking Abby's Breathe Right strips and rubbing them in her own ass crack first.  Considering they won't be invented for years.  Stupid Quincy.  Quincy stinks.  Quincy's a cunt.  He stinks. 
[05:00:00]  But listen again.  It's the typical, like, punk rock speech, man.  Yeah, man.  You're the problem, man.  Society.  Society's the problem.  Does the dopey kid say a scapegoat?  He says a scapegoat.  You'll hold sick society with his dumb accent.  Look, we have reason to believe that she's with Zach's real murderer, Molly Howard, and Molly is trying to push her into a codeine overdose.  Codeine overdose.  So please, if you have any information.  That's a crock, mister.  You think we're all zombie killers. 
[05:00:30]  You're the killers.  Your whole sick society.  That's who's guilty, man.  We're just your lousy escape goat.  Besides, man.  Escape goat.  Who the hell cares?  Yeah.  That really got him right there.  When the kid said, who the hell cares?  Yeah.  It's like, ah, well, no one cares.  How do I battle that?  Smokezilla writes, codeine overdose.  Are they doing cough syrup shooters?  And someone else, Jimmy Jakes writes, I love that they just all take turns yelling at Quince. 
[05:01:00]  Yeah, yeah.  They don't all jump on at once and shut the fuck up.  Your line, my line.  Yeah.  Her line, his line.  Back to me line.  You're sick society.  Society.  And he said, escape goat.  Escape goat.  It's like, he was wrong.  The word is escape, and he shouldn't have used it there.  No.  Anyway.  There you go.  Some Quincey audio.  Yeah.  That was an actual, a legitimate program back then. 
[05:01:30]  Yeah.  Were people just dumber back then?  Was TV all so bad and unrealistic?  We just didn't know any better, man.  It was that sick society.  I don't know.  It just seems like something like, we should have looked and gone, I don't think a coroner  does this.  Hey, this is Brian O'Halloran.  And this is Jeff Anderson from Clerks and Clerks 2.  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Shouldn't we just say this is Dante and Randall?  Nobody knows who the heck Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson are. 
[05:02:00]  Yeah, that is true.  We're there.  We're there.  We're there.  We're there.  We're there.  We're there.  We're there.  We're there.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Is that Lindsay Lohan?  I actually saw this.  Who is it?  Little Joni Cunningham.  Ew, no.  Erin Moran.  Wait, is there a porno with her?  No, it's fake. 
[05:02:30]  It's from Celebrity Fit Club.  Well, then what the fuck was she doing?  Fucking...  They were having a dumb little party and she decided to do a fake orgasm for everybody.  That is so unsexy.  Absolutely.  Don't yell out fucking directions like that.  I know.  Right there, right there, right there, right there, right there, alright.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, right there.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Jesus.  I'll just punch you in it.  After happy days when her and Scott Baio branched off and did Joanie give Chachi a brown 
[05:03:00]  shower.  He called her because she's shit in mid-sentence.  He goes, give it to me, short curve.  Short curve.  Short curve.  Oh, God.  All the chocolate cake.  It's awful.  And then they would use a glad baggie.  Tom Bosley would kill her glad baggie and clean off Scott Baer's face. 
[05:03:30]  It only lasted four episodes because it was the same thing every week.  She eats for the first half and then shits on his face for the second half.  And then Fonzie's other little nephew, Spike, would come in and give Chachi's balls a tickle.  Remember Mullet Leather Tuscadero?  I'm a dyke. 
[05:04:00]  Stupid Ron Howard.  He was fucking bald by season three.  I've had enough of him.  I get it.  You're a director now.  Fuck yourself.  Marian Ross actually had a clit ring.  Did you know that?  She had a big meaty clit with a ring on it.  It looked like Ed Bradley's ear.  Except not black with cancer.  Fonzie was fucking twins as usual. 
[05:04:30]  They're both four.  They're fucking dogs.  Give it taste. 
[05:05:00]  Hey.  Yeah, the twins are coming off and they were just fucking...  Yeah, crawl around.  Jenny Piccolo farted a cum bubble.  Right into Chuck's mouth.  That's why he had to leave after season one.  Because he took a cum bubble in the mouth and no one respected him.  They were like, you're a cuckold, Chuck.  He's like, no, I'm a basketball player.  I beat it, cuckold.  He moved to Milwaukee to act out rape fantasies with Laverne DeFazio. 
[05:05:30]  She wanted to be raped with a Schlitz bottle.  For the illiterate and ignorant, this is dangerous propaganda.  Opie and Anthony.  No!  No!  And that's the worst.  The worst.
