<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts expressing extreme frustration over persistent malfunctions with their studio's audio equipment. Opie, using copious vulgar language, blamed the station's cost-cutting measures and poor maintenance.  They compared the inferior equipment to their superior Sirius XM setup, speculating that management only responds to complaints when offensive content is involved.  Numerous attempts to fix Opie's microphone, including physical force, were unsuccessful.  Callers, including Steve from Jersey, corroborated their complaints, highlighting the age and poor condition of the studio's equipment.  Other callers offered support and suggestions, including a complete switch to the Sirius XM studio.

The conversation then veered to sports, specifically the Tampa Bay Rays' success, the Philadelphia Phillies' lead over the Dodgers, and the changing names of sports teams to remove potentially offensive references.  A discussion on reporting intoxicated fans via text message led to a broader discussion of "nerd culture" and social interaction.  The hosts mentioned a colleague's arrest due to outstanding warrants, followed by a humorous imitation of a baseball game broadcast featuring Joe Torre and Mariano Rivera.  They also recounted meetings with Sirius executives, their exhaustion from work, and a bizarrely bad wig encountered in the building. Upcoming guests were announced: Ludacris, Patrice O'Neal, and Ed Norton.  A recent CNN appearance by Lewis Black, discussing the negative perception of the word "government," sparked a discussion about the political climate.  The segment concluded with a continued discussion of the Red Sox's history of racial discrimination and the perceived insignificance of their first black player, Pumpsy Green.


The next segment heavily featured a discussion on racial dynamics in Boston, specifically the Celticsâ€™ predominantly Black roster and their overwhelmingly white fanbase.  Patrice O'Neal joined the show as a guest.  Callers from Boston shared anecdotal experiences regarding racial tensions and perceptions within the city.  The conversation touched upon the 2008 presidential election, the "Bradley effect," and the economic policies of Obama and McCain.  A significant digression focused on Willie O'Ree and his hardships as the first Black NHL player in Boston.  Rapper Ludacris (Chris Bridges) then joined, promoting his movie *Max Payne*.  He discussed his career, boycotts (including one by Pepsi), and the challenges of navigating stereotypes and prejudice.  The hosts and guests continued debating racial and socioeconomic issues.


The discussion with Ludacris continued, focusing on his acting career, upcoming album *Theater of the Mind*, and his thanks to Oprah and Bill O'Reilly for past contributions to his success.  O'Neal observed that Ludacris, and celebrities generally, play it safe in promotional appearances, avoiding controversial topics, contrasting this with his own confrontational comedy style.  The conversation expanded to address the challenges faced by Black celebrities in Hollywood and the pressures to avoid controversy.  Chris Rock's experiences and Sean Penn's reaction to one of Rock's Oscars jokes were mentioned.  O'Neal expressed frustration at Ludacris's perceived avoidance of past public feuds, analyzing the dynamics between race, celebrity status, and public image.  The segment concluded with further discussion on the pressures faced by celebrities to protect their image, referencing Mel Gibson and Howard Stern. Edward Norton was mentioned as a future guest.


A lengthy discussion about race relations in America followed, featuring frequent use of racial slurs by the hosts and guests.  The conversation focused on the perceived hypocrisy surrounding racial slurs, the complexities of race relations, and the pressure on celebrities to maintain a certain public image.  The hosts and guests debated white people's capacity for honest self-reflection on race, contrasting it with perceived freedom of expression within the Black community.  The Don Imus controversy and the careers of Michael Richards and Ice Cube were discussed.  Later, Edward Norton called in, discussing his new movie, *Pride and Glory*, his political views, and his perspective on Obama's candidacy. He also discussed the challenges of portraying intense scenes, using *American History X* as an example.  The segment concluded with more discussion about *Pride and Glory*, race, politics, and listener-submitted musical covers of "Pendulum".


The phone interview with Edward Norton began with a discussion of *Pride and Glory*, touching on themes of institutional loyalty and whistleblowing. He described a fight scene with Colin Farrell.  The conversation shifted to his past films, including his dislike of *Hulk* and his selective approach to film promotion.  The discussion included extensive and vulgar conversation amongst the hosts and O'Neal about various actors, Edward Norton's personal life, movies (*Entourage*, *The Wire*, *Crash*, *American History X*, *Saving Private Ryan*, *Battlefield Earth*, *The Cosby Show*), and a highly graphic and sexually explicit discussion about the attractiveness of various women, including numerous female celebrities.  The conversation included frequent use of racial slurs and other offensive language.  Jim Norton's comedic stylings and upcoming performances were mentioned. The segment concluded with further discussion of Edward Norton, jokes about race, and sexually explicit conversation.


The show concluded with Patrice O'Neal as a guest, discussing a joke referencing "Crash," and transitioning into a debate about body types and racial preferences in women. O'Neal openly discussed his attraction to Black women, critiquing the perceived double standard regarding body image for women of different races. The discussion included graphic descriptions of female anatomy and preferences, with O'Neal expressing a preference for larger body types.  The show ended with plugs for O'Neal's upcoming stand-up shows and a cut-short "Line of the Day" segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, let's get the show on the road.  Good morning, socialists.  I love my mic.  I love when it sounds like this.  My mic sounds so good.  I'm glad it was checked before the...  That's been good, Joe.  I was going to cry.  Hold on.  Is that better?  No, no. 
[00:00:30]  A little better.  How does this happen?  How is my mic fucked on a daily basis?  How is it?  How is it?  Every day.  Change everything between the transmitter and my microphone.  Isn't that a new module?  Yep.  Well, then, it's not the module.  It's whatever the module plugs into.  It's not a new module. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, my God.  Module.  Good module.  It's off.  It doesn't work.  All right.  Hey, I hope you did me do the show.  I'm going to leave.  This is so stupid.  I love talking like this, though.  It is pretty cool.  It's like I'm at that LOS portion of the flight of Apollo behind the moon.  Come out.  I'll see you guys on the other side. 
[00:01:30]  Holy mother of God.  Was this checked before the show?  Honestly.  I want an honest answer.  Was it checked before the show?  So, five minutes ago.  What?  I can't hear you.  I do.  I turn all the mics on before the show real quick, and it didn't sound bad.  It didn't sound bad.  I mean, I yell from across the room.  I don't walk right up into it, but, you know.  I think every mic has to be like, hello, hello, hello, with headphones on, with whoever's mic we're at.  Because this is silly. 
[00:02:00]  This should happen for three seconds if it should happen at all, and then it should be fixed.  It shouldn't happen at all.  Like a professional radio station in the number one market in the country.  I'm just going to talk like this now.  I don't even care.  I want the world to know that this is how a radio station is run.  In 2008, when they cut back on everything, and we're left with crap. 
[00:02:30]  We're left with garbage, and this is what happens.  This is what a radio host sounds like in the number one market in the country.  This is it.  There's a college in Iowa where some douche kid is sounding 80 times better than this.  Hello, hello, hello.  Check 1-2.  Check 1-2.  Should I be doing a check 1-2 like a junior high school band?  Can we just go to our other studios? 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  Can we just go to our XM studio where at least the crap works?  We have two studios.  At least the other studio, we still have engineers and people that are working on the equipment constantly.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  We don't have oldie time radio equipment in front of us.  We got all brand new digital stuff over there.  Look at this crap.  This is so ridiculous.  This doesn't happen to Rush Limbaugh and talk show hosts that get respect from their company. 
[00:03:30]  There's no reason to do this.  And I apologize to the audience that at 6.02, I'm screaming again about some kind of crap.  I know the audience just loves hearing nagging, but listen to this.  Can I give you this one?  No.  We don't want to use that one.  That one sounds like crap.  I get on that one and it sounds like crap.  I like this mic.  It's the mic I'm used to.  It's like, yeah, tell a race car driver. 
[00:04:00]  You know that car you've been practicing?  Use this one.  Use the Chevy Chevette.  Oh, my God.  I want to curse so badly.  What does this company have planned for us?  Will they let us know?  Because this is getting ridiculous.  If this happened just this morning, whatever, things happen.  But we've been bitching about this for a couple of weeks.  Easy.  Easy.  Yep.  Is anyone listening to us at corporate or are they all scared and hiding in their cubicles 
[00:04:30]  hoping they're not the next fire?  No, no.  They listen if we imitate an Asian voice.  That's when they listen.  They listen if we make a slight racial joke.  That's when they'll listen.  But when the equipment doesn't work and it's impossible to even do any show,  even a milquetoast crap version that they love, then they don't listen.  Eh, they'll get over it.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  That seemed to work. 
[00:05:00]  Did that work a little bit?  Yeah, that's good.  Yeah, just bang on the mic a little bit.  Bang on the $1,000 microphone or whatever it costs.  What is it, $3,000, $5,000, whatever it is?  Where is this getting plugged into?  God only knows what microphone.  Is there a, make sure there's a brand new battery in the Mr. Microphone.  Uh, before we tuned it into the, uh, FM radio and then, uh, I, I, I, I'm so disgusted.  Now what?  Let's see how this works.  Now what are you doing?  Timmy. 
[00:05:30]  La, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Uh, check one, two.  Oh, that sounds fantastically muddy.  And, uh, it's got no, no processing on it.  I sound like, I sound like shit.  Did you hear that?  Hmm?  Did corporate hear Anthony say shit?  Oh, God.  I'm not sure if they heard that, Ant.  Maybe you want to, you know, say it again.  I can't do this.  Take, take, take, take a God effing break and pull that module out and get a new one in there. 
[00:06:00]  Just pull the friggin' thing out, punt it out the window, and put a new module in.  What?  How long does it take?  What the fuck is going on around here?  Now there's too many curses.  At a dump is what's gonna happen.  It doesn't matter, man.  I mean, they don't care, so why should we care?  We were talking about this crap for two weeks.  Oh, take a break. 
[00:06:30]  Perfect song to come back to.  Breathe in.  Breathe out.  Just breathe in.  Breathe out.  Okay.  Well, I think I'm fixed.  I got it.  Good.  Opie and Anthony.  Good morning to everybody.  We were just saying that, like, we understand S happens, but when you're talking about something 
[00:07:00]  for a couple weeks easy, and it's still not fixed, there's a major problem with the company  you work for, and someone needs to step up and do something about it.  We don't know what else to say.  Yeah, it's one of those weird situations.  Well, it sounds much better than it has in quite a while, at least in my headphones.  I sound wonderful.  Good. 
[00:07:30]  Which I should.  877-212-O&A.  Let's say hi to Steve in Jersey.  Steve, what's going on?  Steve.  Hey.  Yeah, I do weekends over at K-Rock.  I was in there on Saturday night.  There was an engineer that came in at, like, 2 or 3 in the morning, and he was fixing something.  He had to do it while I was on the air.  And I said, you know, O&A always pitch about this type of stuff.  And he goes, you know, I'll be amazed if they even notice what I did this time.  Ah, well, we did. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, we did.  That's for sure.  I'll be amazed if they even notice.  Let me just take a ball-peen hammer to Fader 2.  I mean, this board is really old.  I mean, we're in New York City.  We're a radio show broadcasting from New York City, and this thing is really old.  Dude, there's wood on it.  In, like, Hofstra University radio station.  Yeah.  This board has buttons that are labeled Jackie, Howard, Fred, Robin. 
[00:08:30]  For real.  Billy West.  Billy West.  That's how old it is.  That's right.  I mean, it's a really old board.  Yeah.  It's ancient.  And I don't understand why they don't have updated equipment here in New York City.  And this company is the one that insists that we broadcast from here for the first half of the show  and then go to our other studio for the second half.  So if you demand that, then you've got to have everything right for us.  Is it true that they rope it off at night and bring tours through as a museum of old radio stuff? 
[00:09:00]  Exactly.  Like, old tube equipment?  It's just ridiculous.  Talon, the trucker.  How are you, Talon?  I blame Obama, by the way, for all this.  Good morning, guys.  Yeah, thank you.  I don't know if it was a good moment, but maybe they want you to use your old-style radio voice.  Yes.  Bye-bye.  Thank you.  We're broadcasting here live from Lakehurst, New Jersey as the Hindenburg comes in.  What's the biggest disaster, the Hindenburg or this studio's equipment? 
[00:09:30]  Oh, goodness.  Get out of the way.  I'll be throwing something.  Yeah, great.  Now I've got to get another x-ray.  My effin' toe.  Look at that.  And my shoe fell off.  That's pretty impressive.  I don't know what.  Did you get the metal garbage, pal?  Give a little punt?  Hand punt.  Let's say hi to Bob Bland.  It ain't working. 
[00:10:00]  Why ain't it working?  Ain't working.  Bob Bland.  Good morning, boys.  It's Bob Bland from Baltimore, and I'm calling to congratulate you.  I love the bit about the fake and faulty equipment.  It's really edgy, and it doesn't offend anybody.  I'm punchin' in.  Well, thank you, Mr. Bland.  Wonderful.  You liked our little bit, our little skit.  Yeah.  Rob on Long Island.  Rob.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, if anything else goes wrong this morning, I think you guys should just call it in for 
[00:10:30]  all that stuff on CBS and just walk over to XM and do a, you know, full-length XM show.  It's been a few years since we've gotten, like, you know, four hours of, you know, uncensored  material.  Well, I'll tell you this much, you know, we've got a really nice state-of-the-art studio over there.  You know, CBS is the ones that insist that we're here every day.  So, all we ask if we're going to be here every day is we have nice equipment that's not going to go, you know, go bad on us. 
[00:11:00]  That's all.  They just keep cutting and cutting and cutting.  It's just amazing.  All right, boys.  Well, good luck.  That's all I got.  Punch it out.  It's this new climate, this new climate we're in where it's just every company, it's not just radio either.  They just cut back, cut, cut, cut, consolidate jobs for people, and it's just, and I do hate to make this political,  but you think it's going to be any better when they're just taxing the living hell out of these companies on top of all this?  There's going to be no money left for them to do anything. 
[00:11:30]  They'll just fire more people, more engineers.  There's, there'll be, there'll be like fire extinguishers here just for when things spontaneously combust,  we can put the fires out ourselves.  You can imagine just, uh-uh, yeah, put out the fire, chief.  Yeah.  Just grab the fire extinguisher and start spraying it on the board.  By the way, there's still a hum, but we gave up on that a while ago.  I like it.  It's sort of a, it's a calming hum.  I feel like Pete Townsend. 
[00:12:00]  I just, I just figured I, I spent too many.  It's tinnitus.  Yeah, I figured I just spent too many years touring the world and I'll just deal with it.  I'll make believe I'm Pete Townsend.  Yeah, don't talk for a second.  Let me hear.  Wow, yeah.  Oh, that is a good one.  We bitched about that a while ago.  Just to make sure you have his laptop.  Yeah.  We gave up on that one a while ago.  See, we have to give up on stuff, but we at least need Anthony's microphone to work.  And now it just throws off the whole, the radio guys and a radio station is like a very delicate ecosystem. 
[00:12:30]  It really is.  It really is.  You need all the equipment to work.  You got to settle in and you got to, you got to eat and have a cup of coffee and just get, get your, your, your, your, yourself set.  And when this stuff goes wrong, it really messes up a lot of things and takes a while to get back on track.  It's like tripping on the starting line.  Right.  For a race.  And then trying to like, yeah.  And try to place in the 100 meter dash.  It's just not going to happen.  Let's say hi to Brian in Philly.  Brian.  What's up, boys? 
[00:13:00]  Hey, Brian.  Yeah, I just want to say bad equipment plus ants bitching equals great radio.  Yeah, I'm loving that ant bitch.  How are you, Brian?  I'm loving the, uh.  I just get all anguished.  I love that.  I get anguished.  But I'm resilient.  I'm adaptable.  So what's going to, what's going to be done there, Stunt Brain?  Like, what happens now?  We leave here at nine and then what?  Are you going to go right up to, uh, corporate and start, like, you know, strangling people for us?  I've already started the angry email.  That's good.  Right.  And, uh, sending that out.  But, yeah, I'm going to go knock on the door. 
[00:13:30]  What do they do?  Well, part of the problem.  What do they do up there, really?  Well, the problem is this board has apparently been on since we got here.  So it hasn't been shut down and maintained.  Which you should do.  And the age of it has something to do with it.  Why does this board have to be on?  We're basically the only show that uses it.  Oh, no.  We have another studio that the rest of the jocks use for the most part.  Because since we've gotten the new neighbors here, the studio allocation has changed.  Right.  So it's not always, you know, we have Nick Carter is in here and then occasionally other talent is in here during the day. 
[00:14:00]  All of them are in here, apparently.  So this thing is never maintained properly.  It's old.  Needs a little downtime.  Yeah.  This thing is really old.  It needs a nap.  A nap?  It has a look Fred button.  I mean, this is old.  Does it have a look Fred button?  Yes.  Two of them.  It has two look Fred.  What happens when you press it?  Does the light go on?  No.  There was a light.  There was a light.  There was a light. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  Right now, Fred's going, wait a minute.  Sorry, Fred.  Fred's trying to do his job from at another studio and we're shining a light in his face, I guess.  Yeah, then it says, there's a button that says, who, who, Jackie, Fred, Robin.  I mean, this thing is old, man.  Look at the dust on it.  Yeah, it's very dusty.  All right, well.  Yeah.  Okay, where were we?  Well, we were rudely interrupted. 
[00:15:00]  That somebody would hit a button to get somebody to look instead of the way we do it, which is, hey, stupid look.  I know.  That is true.  So there's like, yeah, let's just press a button and then you look over here so I can give you a signal.  It's just like, hey, dummy.  Yeah.  It's like, hey, fatso.  Hey, drunk.  Hey, idiot.  Whatever.  All the same person.  Where were we?  Well, we were going to start the show and that's what we'll do.  Yeah. 
[00:15:30]  What happened last night?  Let's see.  Well, you got the Rays beating the Red Sox.  I didn't even know they were just called the Rays anymore.  That's how much I don't care.  I went, oh, so the Devil Rays and then I was reprimanded by Travis.  Right.  That's just the Rays now.  You know what?  I'm calling him the Devil Rays still.  What's wrong with the Devil Rays?  Why did they change that?  Oh, did they actually, the team changed it?  Yes.  It's the Tampa Bay Rays.  Hey, Ray.  You can't have evil. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, you can call me Ray.  Oh, you can call me Devil Ray.  That guy.  How did he have a career?  He was the worst.  How did he have a career?  Every time that commercial aired, he should have lost a toe under a lawnmower.  But you doesn't have to call me Johnson.  Ray J. Johnson.  All right.  Every bad variety show in the 70s, that douche showed up on.  He was a goose.  But, yeah, they're the Rays now, and apparently they're kicking Boston's ass.  Well, you've got to get evil and Indian stuff out of sports. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  That's what happened the last few years.  Devilish.  No more devils and no more Indian stuff.  Travissimo?  Yeah, they say that, I mean, because they were terrible for 10 years before this.  So, before this season, they changed the name, they shortened it, changed their logo, colors,  everything.  So, they say it was like just a whole team.  That makes the team better?  Well, no, I'm saying that they say it was like part of a whole team makeover.  Yeah.  But, you know, you could totally be right that they just wanted to get the devil out of  the name.  Of course. 
[00:17:00]  Because that's what's happening in high schools and colleges.  They don't want to see that.  Oh, my God.  I'm not going to see a team with devil in the name.  No one was going to see them anyway.  Yeah.  True.  Yeah.  Well, they're beating up on the Red Sox, the champs.  13-4 last night and lead the series three games to one.  Oops.  That series is over, my friends.  Well, that's what we said.  Over?  You know, when the Yankees were up on the Sox.  Yeah. 
[00:17:30]  Remember that one.  I think I do.  Yeah.  So, and then you got the, well, you got the Phillies leading the Dodgers 3-1.  So, is Bill from Waterford saying it's a Christian owner of the team?  I have no idea.  Oh, really?  Oh, perhaps.  Well, there's a whole family-friendly thing happening in sports.  It's in sports and everything.  Yeah, which is driving me nuts.  Yeah.  Because they're trying to get, they're pretty much trying to take fighting out of hockey  now.  Yeah.  They just don't want that because, you know, there's kids, there's kids in the stands. 
[00:18:00]  And then they play the little peewee league and they start punching each other.  Well, that's good.  It is.  Makes the kids a little tougher.  And the parents get out and start beating each other up and the cops are called and it's  fun.  Yeah.  It makes good YouTube clips.  Yeah, it's fun for everybody.  And apparently I was reading that at the New Eagles stadium now, you can actually text  security about like drunk fans ratting out drunk fans anonymously through that. 
[00:18:30]  We've entered a weird age.  That's the nerd.  Danny?  That's the nerd.  Danny wants to, he wants to comment that he was texted on.  Yeah.  Although I wouldn't doubt it.  Whoever.  By whoever you were with.  No.  By the beer vendor.  This kid won't stop waving at me.  Get this kid out of here.  No one else can get a drink in the park.  He's ordering drinks four at a time.  Yes, Danny?  I can't even defend myself. 
[00:19:00]  Whoever said that the Devil Ray's owner was a Christian, that's probably false information  considering the guy's name is Stuart Sternberg.  Oh.  Good job, Bill.  I'm thinking the Christian angle isn't there.  Way to go, Bill.  Way to go.  Bill is the goose of the day on Pal Talk.  Way to go.  You're a silly, silly goose, Bill.  That's hilarious.  That's hilarious.  So you can rat out people that are drinking too much at sporting events now? 
[00:19:30]  That's more of that nerd culture, man.  That just reminds me of...  You shouldn't be able to do anything anonymously.  One of those little kids in a movie, you get one of those little kids from like Nazi Germany  or Stalin's Soviet Union that just walks up to someone and points at them and they're  taken away.  Yeah.  That's what it is.  It's just, there's a man in seat.  What seat is he in?  What seat?  Okay.  He's in 5B in section 402 and he's intoxicated and ruining my family's experience. 
[00:20:00]  And then what do they do?  They drag you off?  That's it.  They probably come watch you.  Come on.  They come over there and they watch you a little bit.  See if you're going, meh, you son of a meh, meh, meh, meh.  And then they drag you to that cell that every new ballpark has.  Every new ballpark, right?  Don't they put little gels in there now?  Yeah, downstairs.  Fantastic.  Let's just sober up.  Ah, I'm catching the game from here. 
[00:20:30]  Master Poe out of jail.  Yes.  One of our guys got arrested yesterday.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Outstanding warrants.  What?  I don't know.  I had a couple of tickets, he said.  Some traffic stuff.  A couple of tickets that, you know.  Yeah.  You don't pay those things.  People, they look for you.  Yeah.  And he's like, I was on the cell phone with no seat belt.  Dude.  I passed one of those checkpoints yesterday.  They set up a few of them around the city.  They'd put, like, one of those little rolling phone booths that the cops use in the middle 
[00:21:00]  of the road, and then two uniformed officers on either side of it, and they're just looking  at you, just looking, seat belt, you on the phone, you're Reggie, inspectioning, you know,  up to date.  Yeah.  It's like, oh, God, you know, could you just maybe leave that alone?  It really is sad.  But, yeah, he was here this morning, so.  I'm looking at this Dodger loss. 
[00:21:30]  Yes, the Dodgers in trouble, too.  I like Joe Torre.  They're yelling at Torre, actually, about their last loss.  One fault he had with the Yankees was he always brought Rivera in in the eighth inning, especially  after Stanton and Nelson left.  He would always bring him in, and it just overused him a little bit.  A little too early, yeah.  Same thing.  That's what he did.  Was he doing that?  Even though he's a good manager, but that's the same thing.  Yeah.  He brought his clothes in.  They're screaming about it.  Stop bringing your clothes in the eighth inning, stupid. 
[00:22:00]  Stop panicking, Joe.  Stop panicking.  Take a third inning.  Get Rivera!  Just a base hit.  We're up 4-1.  Get Rivera!  Get Mo!  He goes out to the mound, plops his prostate in his glove.  Here, pitch this.  Yeah, try this.  Try the old spitter.  This one will curve real good, yeah.  I'm sorry, we can't use that.  It's a softball.  He panics.  What is he, Joe?  He gets a panicky Pete. 
[00:22:30]  The Dodgers are in trouble.  Yes, they are.  It's the bottom of the eighth.  The Yankees, 4-1.  Uh, uh, uh, two outs.  Uh, ball one.  Get Mo!  Get him!  He's a relaxed show.  He's calling for Mo.  Rivera's, she pitched the ninth inning.  I know Eckersley used to pitch for a long time.  You know, he pitched three.  Mm-hmm.  Stop panicking.  That's right, Jim.  I can't help but agree with you.  You're right.  Got to meet Mad Dog yesterday.  Yes.  Yes, the Mad Dog. 
[00:23:00]  He's in the, uh, he was in the office next door to, uh, the office we were meeting in.  Yeah.  Over there.  And the doors are shut and everything.  And you just hear through the wall.  Yeah, come on.  I can see that one.  I can see that one.  I can see that one.  I can see that one.  Does the guy sleep, you think?  No.  It was, I swear, I thought he was doing his show from his office.  he was just  he's such a hyper guy  he is a really good guy though 
[00:23:30]  very fun  the mad dog  sounds like a tickle me Elmo  it's a tickle me mad dog  stop it with the cookie goo  I bet you in his personal life  he's an abusive drunk  he's probably a humorless  abusive beater 
[00:24:00]  and he's all fun and everything  yeah well  I'm a little mad about the Dodgers  yeah those meetings  wow  I gotta tell you  I uh you know  we're in the getting to know you phase  of a lot of the brass  over there at Sirius  because you know  it was a nice equal merger  sure  which means  everyone from XM gets fired 
[00:24:30]  yep  and everyone from Sirius stays  yep  I don't know how that happened  but it's just the way it is  and we go over for meetings  and these post show meetings  it's like some kind of competition  for me to stay awake  and it's no reflection  on the content of the meeting  or who's speaking  or anything like that  usually  no you're being polite  it absolutely is  no  because I think these guys  have to justify their job  so they feel like  they have to have FaceTime with you  it's like  just let us do our thing 
[00:25:00]  you do your thing  we'll communicate  through a BlackBerry  and that's it  it's the future  we don't need to sit in an office  after doing five and a half hours of radio  I think if you could turn in drunks  at a ballpark  with text  right  you could carry on some business  yeah you could get a lot done  through the BlackBerry  yeah a few little things there  but I can't sit in a meeting  and it's always been like that  like even in class  sitting in class in school  I would just doze  and if I had a great night's sleep  it wouldn't matter  it's just this whole thing  of somebody talking  and me having to listen 
[00:25:30]  yeah  I guess that's why it's a perfect job  I could just talk  I don't have to really listen  if you listen to the replay  you could tell  because a lot of times  I repeat things people said already  well you know  because you're thinking ahead  yeah that's what it is  you're thinking ahead  but I get so like drowsy  yesterday I just started yawning  one yawn after another  and I felt bad  I'm just like oh god  you had wobbly head too  yeah  I'm looking down at my shoes  I'm kind of looking up at the ceiling 
[00:26:00]  I'm just trying to stay awake  yeah  when I get in my truck  and it's a two ton  90 mile an hour thing  guided by someone asleep  yeah  I'm convinced the two companies  want to just turn us into zombies  yeah well good job  do the first half of the show here  do the zombie walk to another studio  continue your radio show  after that  after that's done  walk in eight blocks  or whatever it is  walk in eight blocks  city blocks  go through security  go up 40 floors  and sit in a room for a while  yeah  what are they trying to do to us 
[00:26:30]  it really is just  we had to be in three different locations yesterday  no one has to be in three different locations for their job  ridiculous  it's just ridiculous  I was out of there so quick too  yeah  I was out of there  like I wanted to wait for Jimmy  but I think Jim  was it your tummy Jimmy  or did you have to go wee-wees  I had to tinkle  I wouldn't do anything else there  no  no I don't need  oh well there's serious people coming in and checking it out  let them get to know you  listening to the sounds  sense  yeah 
[00:27:00]  they could smell you  yeah because I wanted to wait you know  for a little while  and I just got the hell out of there  I went right downstairs  I didn't expect  I was in the bathroom  I walked in probably ten seconds later  I'm like where's Ant  he's like he's on the LIA  oh hell yeah  I was gone  he hid down on the elevator bank  quicker than I had ever seen anyone do that before  so  yes  and I was  by the way Jimmy  I was laughing all night 
[00:27:30]  thinking about that guy's wig  that we saw in the lobby  oh my god  we're in the lobby  worst wig ever  and this guy had a wig on  that was  it wasn't a toupee  it wasn't  it was a hair hat  wig  and we're in the elevator  still laughing about it  and Jimmy brings up a great point  that  what did you say  it would look more realistic  if he just like wrote  hair on a piece of paper  and taped it to his head  laughing  that had me all night 
[00:28:00]  just hair  tape it to your head  laughing  that's a great line man  it was the most  terrible  attempt  at looking like  you have hair  oh  I couldn't tell  if it was a wig  or if it was like  really dark shoe polish  no that was such a wig  because  me and Jimmy  did a flyby  we went real close  to like the side  and back of his head  to take a look  because you had to know  we had to  yeah get a good look  and it was this kind of  reddish  brown color  the wig 
[00:28:30]  and then underneath  you could just see  gray  black  like  with the  consistency of pubes  kind of sticking out  the bottom  of this wig  of this Mike Myers  colored wig head  that's his tiny  little horseshoe  that he's got left  oh just awful  yeah  there was space  in between the wig  and his head  like I saw his wallet  his card  he could just keep  things in there  it was like an army helmet  he's got like  sulfur  things up there  to help his wounded comrades  sir you have  born to kill 
[00:29:00]  written in your hair  laughing  that was a creep  oh boy was he  he's probably  he's probably  he's got his phone  near schools  he's not allowed  near them  so he puts on  different hair colors  and hopefully  he can get a little closer  walk someone home  with his briefcase  alright we're getting  back on track  we got Ludacris  coming in today  we also have  Patrice O'Neill  coming in today  Patricchio's coming in  we also got Ed Norton  calling us today  Lewis Black  a good friend of ours  was doing something 
[00:29:30]  for CNN and Time  some kind of  symposium  a symposium  what is a symposium  something he would be  involved in  what's the definition  of a symposium  you get in front  of some people  and you  and you  symp  sympose  sympose  sympose  what is it  something to do  with an orchestra  it's a  it's a  it's a conference  or a meeting  hobby  hobby  yeah I know  it's some kind  of conference  to discuss a subject 
[00:30:00]  oh that's a symposium  I think back in the day  though  called a conference  you kind of did  some drinking  and stuff  at a symposium  yeah you sat around  and just kind of  had a few beers  and kind of  shoot the  shoot the yes  the convivial  definition  yes is a  drinking party  there you go  symposium  so Lewis Black  was doing one  of those things  and he got  really angry  that the word  government  is seen as evil  wow  just one thing  and that is  everybody seems  to think it's fun  to parody 
[00:30:30]  what you call  parody  the United States  etc  but I find it  very interesting  that no matter  where you go  in the world  everybody still  wants to come here  no matter what's  happening  and the main  problem with Amtrak  is it's government  run  ok  that's  that's interesting  is that the problem  is government  the word  that's bad  he's building up  alright  wouldn't it be  interesting  would Enron 
[00:31:00]  have run better  would these guys  who just basically  destroyed the economy  what is it  at what point  doesn't anyone  comprehend  that government  is not a word  it's people  it's people  who do the job  that's what it is  and whether you're  working in a business  or you're working  in government  there are rules  and you follow  those rules  and it's the people 
[00:31:30]  in those positions  who are responsible  for it  not the government  holy  jesus  he's not happy  louis  i was just doing  a train joke  yeah  right  louis  i was like  i was slouching  in my seat  listening to that  like i was being  yelled at  yeah  louis has a way  of doing that  you knew the guy  was in trouble  and louis said  is that the problem  is that the problem  yeah he was  he built it up  oh so  that's the problem  you never want  to hear that  it's people 
[00:32:00]  the jackass  who was in charge  who does that  wait a second  because if we're  going to get into  that you're insane  because to say  it's clinton's fault  that he picked  a schmuck  then look at  numbnuts here  and the amount  of idiots  he picked  they both pick  him  but it's sad  that we've  reached a point  where government  service is a dirty  word  where it's  shoveled behind  i come from dc 
[00:32:30]  my father worked  for the government  he did a hell  of a job  for them  and i'm sick  of people  demeaning it  if we're the  greatest country  on earth  maybe we could  have the  greatest government  louis  louis is running  for office i think  i want to vote  for louis  i don't like the  fact that louis  is doing this  pro-government  thing because  the democrats  are about to  step in  i don't like it  if that would  have happened  two years ago  he'd be going  you're right  the government's  insane  exactly 
[00:33:00]  dumb  louis  the government  he's a funny  bastard  he really is  i took a lot  of what i  anger directed  at you mostly  had to do  with some  went through  today  it really  didn't have  to do  with you  just so you  know  i'm serious  i yell a lot  and sometimes  i step over  the line  but that  had to do  i'm getting  okay  so it  wasn't  i apologize  well then he  apologizes  bottle doodle 
[00:33:30]  sorry homeless  charlie said  that  this is what we  gonna do  we're gonna take  a break  we're gonna  regroup  for real  we're gonna  get patrice  o'neill in  here  and we're  gonna rock  the rest of  the morning  for everybody  877-212-ONA  if you got  something for  the show  it's opie  and anthony  stay there  it's the opie

[00:34:30]  rays still  the devil  rays  tampa bay  rays  they just  call them  the rays  did they  change the  name for  religious  reasons  i'm sure  somebody  complained  or something  and uh  someone  buck  hold  just like  the  washington  bullets  yeah  they had  the washington  uh  wizards  because uh  the bullet  bullets  is very uh  makes people  deadly  nervous  yeah  you gotta love  that a team  called themselves  the bullets  and probably had  nothing to do  with crime 
[00:35:00]  probably speed  or something like  that  yeah  yeah  right  but it is a  pretty accurate  yeah  watch team name  sure  it's had to  change it just  to change the  feel  yeah  the dc  drive-bys  are playing  the phillies  the washington  bullets  and they had  the cool  bullet logo  they were  i love that  the little  the little  but now  it's you know  the wizards  well now we got  the rays  the rays are  you know  no devil  no devil  no devil  you can't put  any uh  indian  things in there  no woo  no yeah 
[00:35:30]  no war like  things  no  i didn't know  woo woo  was a bad  thing  it is  i didn't know  this  was a bad  thing  well pulling  your corner  of your eyes  apart to  imitate asians  is not really  a bad thing  but it is a  bad thing  and they get  mad yeah  they get angry  yeah  but you know  a lot of  sports teams  have been named  after indians  kind of you know  which is actually  a compliment  yeah  because it's  they're warlike  right 
[00:36:00]  warlike fighters  they're warrior  you're out there  battling  and you want to  emerge victorious  sitting bull  yeah  and uh  whatever the rest  of them  Pocahontas  Geronimo  Geronimo  Geronimo  um  the red skins  Larry the Indian  who no one  talks about  what about  Ted the Indian  the dude  that cries  over garbage  yeah  he was the  manic depressive 
[00:36:30]  Indian  nothing to do  with the garbage  the really upset  garbage Indian  uh  Chief J Strongbone  and his  unknown  cousin  Jewel  Strongbow  who was around  for a couple  of years  oh my god  wow you're  going way back  the girl on  the Mazzola  yeah  Mazzola butter  thing  Orlando  legs  and if you  cut that right  and folded it  you can make it  look like her  kneecaps were  her boobs  which was a lot  of fun when  you were a little  kid  yeah 
[00:37:00]  but if you're  naming your team  after some kind  of Indian  thing  you're basically  saying we're  strong  we're fighters  we're yeah  what else do  they have  they try to  race everything  so dumb  yeah  I'd like to  name a team  the Kentucky  escaped slaves  the Nat  Turners  that could be a  problem  the Pennsylvania  Nat  Douglass  I wouldn't get  them  can you imagine  that  and the Harriet 
[00:37:30]  Tubmans are  taking the field  Harriet Tubmans  the Anne Franks  are 0-7 so far  Anthony the new  thing is just  to cut out the  knees and just  put them up  there as boobs  oh is that it  I know you used  to fold it  but now they  just they're  lazy so they  just cut out  the knees  and pop them  up there as  boobies for the  Lando Lakes  girl we'll put  that up on  onaradio.com  now the  double ray  well the  rays  you were saying  wow how  exciting  I can't wait  it's going to  be the rays 
[00:38:00]  and the  phillies  how can you  wait  Tampa Bay  versus Philly  they'll make  more money  I'm helping  baseball right  now they'll  make more  money if they  put it in  pay-per-view  other than  like you said  if they sell  advertisement  for the free  game  they'll make  less money  than if they  sell it  pay-per-view  and only people  in Philly  and Tampa  buy it  those are the  only people  only baseball  fans  in Philly  and Tampa  are going to  watch this  no one  cares  it's not 
[00:38:30]  like you  know when  you get  the Yankees  Red Sox  thing going  that's a lot  of people  Red Sox  anyone going  is much  better than  the Rays  and Yankees  anyone going  sure  well and we're  going to lose  the Dodgers  too  which is a big  market  that probably  would have gotten  some Yankee  fans just to see  how Torrey  runs the team  but the Manny  Boston thing  the Manny  Boston thing  would have  been tremendous  but no one  told the Devil  Rays  and no one  told  did you see  the thing  though 
[00:39:00]  the Red Sox  and you know  I love  anything racial  of course  it makes  white people  look bad  but I was  reading it  and I couldn't  even understand  they would  I didn't  understand  what they  were trying  to make  me be  angry  or informed  MSN  has a thing  about how  the Red Sox  have no  black people  like it's  is they racist  or something  I don't  what are you  trying to say  I don't know  what I'm  trying to say  you're lost  what happened  it's the  wasn't that  about the lack  of Latin  players or  something  no the lack  of black  players or  something 
[00:39:30]  on the Sox  Latin they did  at 1.2  they did a story  on Latin  nah it wasn't  Latin  because everybody  on the Red Sox  is Latin  they did it  after many  there's white  people in Latin  there's no black  people  well I don't  think the black  athlete wants to  play in Boston  for the most part  oh  but they said  Jimmy the Greek  I was just  going to say  okay Jimmy the  Greek why don't  you enlighten us  you see  you see what  they did back  in the old  days  all right  Jimmy  it was such  a Jimmy the  Greek  state bath 
[00:40:00]  we don't play  baseball anymore  anyway for some  reason  I don't know  what's going on  what do you mean  black people don't  play baseball that  much  no  the numbers  are dwindling  they kind of  went down  and you know  Dominicans  that's a smart  I had a son  I made him play  golf or baseball  you can play  baseball until  you're 49  no injuries  if you get a  baseball injury  you're a sissy  what'd you do  you twist an ankle  really  what happened  you ran against  the wall  going for a 
[00:40:30]  fly ball  stupid  the bridge  of your nose  hurts now  look at these  football players  that are rolling  around in  wheelchairs  they call  football players  old at 32  like what's  the boy name  Tony Gonzalez  from Kansas City  wants to get  traded  and they go  well we don't  know if we can  get full value  for him  he's 32  now  it's like  32  do you know  that's a young  man  so if he  retires at 35  what is he  yeah  he's a young  he's just a  big young  old man  that's why  all those guys 
[00:41:00]  just open up  car dealerships  in some  crappy little  town somewhere  and hope that  pans out  shakes hands  with people  hey I'm the  guy  remember  there's pictures  of him  like on the  walls of his  office in the  car dealership  playing football  and if you  weren't training  yourself to be  a dude who knows  how to talk  at the end of your  career  you can't even  get a job  no because that's  why again I'll go  with the car dealership  thing you go to  we've traveled around  a lot and you go to  some of these markets 
[00:41:30]  and you watch TV  and you see these  guys it used to be  sports figures and  they're selling cars  because they own the  dealership now it's  like you'll definitely  score when you come  down to my car  dealership we have  touchdowns and savings  Lin Swan Ford  Lin Swan Ford  they're just trying  their best to to  blurt something  intelligible out  like come down  you'll be driving  like I used to  drive over the  gold line  it's like all 
[00:42:00]  right  we need another  analogy  this is Jack  Tatum's Chevy  we break high  prices back  you won't be able  to move  if you come on  down and  Jack Tatum  oh that's awful  oh that's awful  but some people  are prepared for  the end of their  career  Lawrence Taylor  Chrysler  come take a crack  at our prices  we're breaking 
[00:42:30]  the legs  at high prices  oh no  oh no  oh god I'm so  happy I don't  know his name  so I don't get  in trouble  there's an OJ  Simpson slashing  the prices  oh well  and Pac-Man  like he's  Pac-Man  God what  you know Pac-Man  would be like  in the real  trouble if he  wasn't playing  football  he would be  he got 
[00:43:00]  suspended  he got suspended  might be open  no I know  he got suspended  for beating up  his bodyguard  it isn't even  his bodyguard  yeah the  Cowboys gave  him a bodyguard  to keep him  out of trouble  right  and he got  in a fight  with the  bodyguard  that's keeping  him out of  trouble  but the point  I'm making  is this guy  is in trouble  but this is him  behaving  because he's  in the NFL  if he's out  on the streets  forget it  he'd be  away for life  by now  this is him  behaving  he's insane  but come on  do you dismiss 
[00:43:30]  it as insanity  when you got  a million dollars  and you can't  stop  like if somebody  like they're  telling him  don't do it  like if somebody  said Patrice  you're gonna  lose everything  if you need  eat another  banana nut  chocolate chip  muffin  and you know  to almost  everybody else  you go  alright I'm  not gonna eat  that  what  but if you  said Patrice  you'll risk  everything  for a nice  you know  Dunkin Donuts  flatbread turkey  if you eat  another one  it's over  yeah  and you're  just like  everybody else 
[00:44:00]  like okay  so it's like  it's like  Pac-Man  hey look man  don't stab  nobody else  or you're  gonna lose  10 million dollars  hey  someone wants  to defend  my Jimmy  the Greek  statement  good  James  in New  Hampshire  help me  out here  hey  I'll be the  Greek  I just  want to give  you a little  support  I know  Tim Duncan  of the Spurs  actually has a  clause in his  contract that says  he cannot be  traded to Boston  there you go  proving my point  why would he have  that  because he doesn't  want to play  in Boston  that's the old 
[00:44:30]  school Boston  this is not the  Bill Russell Boston  maybe it's a Celtics  thing though  he may be  he hates the Celtics  which Celtic  did they pull over  because he was  driving a really  nice car  Dee Brown  was it Dee Brown  I know all the  races  I know every  I know the  racist timeline  in Boston  starting which  my earliest  memory was me  and then  the next one  was Charles  Smith  what was Dee  Brown  he was on  Route 9  he was on  Route 9  in Wellesley  in Wellesley  what was he  doing in 
[00:45:00]  Wellesley  exactly  he was just  driving through  did he have  like a nice  Mercedes or  Jag or something  he had a  really nice car  and the police  pulled him over  going there's no  way a black  guy can have  a nice car  like that  and Bill Russell  called him  he said stop  crying  they used to  egg Bill  Russell's house  on the regular  as he's winning  championships  he won him  what like 15  championships  12 million  championships  and they  egg his house  and break his  windows  and stole  his rings  they stole 
[00:45:30]  his god damn  rings  they stole  his rings  is that true  yes  stole his  championship  rings out of  Boston  oh that's  great  oh my god  am I going to  scream about  that November  15th  I'm up there  doing that  show  oh Jimmy  love Boston  wait a minute  are you doing  that's  comments come  home that  time  I'll be up  there  comments come  home is the  same day  I believe so  good job  agents  wonderful  I'm not sold  out  we get back to 
[00:46:00]  the Bill  Russell thing  so he's winning  championships  they're egging  his house  he hates  Boston  how do they  steal his  rings  they went  in his  house  because he  lived in  Wellesley  the doors  are open  it's against  a lot to have  locks in  Wellesley  so they just  walked up  in his  house  how great  is it  he's on  that court  with his  blood  and the  sweat  and the  robber's  like well  we know  he's not  coming home  because he's  winning  another  championship  went in there  and took  his damn  rings  took one of  his 11  rings  his thumb 
[00:46:30]  ring they  stole  those dirty  rotten  guns out  there  we got more  on the  Duncan thing  Dennis  helping out  my Jimmy  the Greek  thing  go ahead  Dennis  the reason  Duncan  doesn't want  to play  is because  Bill Russell  wasn't allowed  to live  in certain  areas  in white  Boston  when he  was winning  11 championships  for the city  and the Red Sox  were the last  team to have  a black player  like 15 years  after Jackie  Robinson  this is  wacko up  do you understand  why I'm angry  does it make 
[00:47:00]  sense  that's great  about the  Jackie  Robinson  thing  like  alright  Jackie  Robinson  comes around  and then  there's a bunch  of teams  like  we'll give  it a year  or two  but give  it 15  years  Boston  waited  it's  amazing  you want  to be a  little careful  like I  don't know  but 15  years  first black  player was  Jim Rice  I don't  get it  man  wait 15  years after  the last 
[00:47:30]  after Jackie  Robinson  after  they broke  the color  barrier  that's a  whole  career  for somebody  another black  dude  started his  career  and retired  before Boston  and Boston  is like  alright I  guess it's  going to be  okay  and y'all  call it  the  we're a  racist  town  curse  some black  person  put a curse  on the  thing  until  I don't  know  what  happened  right it  off  I guess  because  Manny  and Ortiz  finally  kind of  made it  yeah  alright  let's say  hi to  I had a  good joke  but it's 
[00:48:00]  no  I filtered  it  instead of  curse of  the  Bambino  curse of  the  you know  yeah  loud and  clear  very good  of course  let's go to  DC  home of the  Baltimore  Bullets  Baltimore  Bullets  Washington  neighborhood  yeah but it  used to be  the Baltimore  Bullets  back in  the day  oh yeah  it was  was it  uh  Steamer  what's up  hey guys  good morning  good morning  and Patrice  this one's for  you since we're 
[00:48:30]  doing the  racial card  thing  the uh  racial card  I'm sorry  could you not  dismiss this  as a card  when we just  were stating  facts  do you accept  those facts  you're just playing  the race card  do you accept  those facts  that Bill  Russell had  his ring stolen  in Boston  D Brown got  pulled over  in Wellesley  for no reason  uh  that that the  Red Sox  didn't put a  black play on  the thing  till 15 years  after the  color line  look that up  is that a race  card  did somebody  get out of  what are you  talking about 
[00:49:00]  the race  card  what are you  talking about  Patrice I'm  on your side  man  I'm sure  you are  go ahead  I just wanted  to share  with you  that the  uh  when the  Boston Braves  moved to  Atlanta  they were  considering  naming the  team  after the  original  baseball team  in Atlanta  which would  have been  the Atlanta  Crackers  really  yeah  but  well  alright  well you know  what Cracker  is right  I've heard  things  the what  the whip  cracking  yeah the  crack of the  whip 
[00:49:30]  is it  really though  absolutely  it's not  saltines  like people  think it's  you're named  after the  white crack  it's the  crack of the  whip  yeah  that was  the guy  we got  the story  on the  black player  for the  Red Sox  the Boston  Red Sox  this is  this hilarious  I'm sorry  were the  last major  league  baseball  team  to integrate  their roster  in 1959  12 years  after  Jackie Robinson  broke the  league's  color barrier  by joining  the Brooklyn  Dodgers 
[00:50:00]  the Red Sox  brought infielder  Pumpsy Green  up from the  minors  Pumpsy Green  Pumpsy Green  come to  Pumpsy Green  Chrysler  because that's  what was in  his back  all kind of  Pumpsy  big Pumpsy  he survived  all the  shoes  oh my god  12 years  that's where  I grew up  12 years  after  Jackie Robinson  that's where  I grew up  man  I understand  the year or two  you're not so  sure  how it's going to  play in your  city but 12  years later  and the 
[00:50:30]  new Celtics  all black  all black  and I'd like  to sit down  with a nice  card carrying  white person  from Boston  a real  one that'll  have a real  conversation  ask him how  he really feels  about that  it was a big  it was a big  parade and  everything when  they won  but I'd like  to just sit  down with a  nice dude  from a  Sully  from a  Sully  or something  and go  what did  you really  feel dude  not one  white dude  was significant  you know  on the team 
[00:51:00]  like if it  really does  that way  I'm curious  I don't know  I don't know  because I can't  really get a  nice  only honest  racial thing  I can get  is coming in  here  get a good  honest  I bet for a  white like  Celtics fan  like that  it's the Celtics  the Celtics  yeah  it's like an  Irish thing  and it's just  a bunch of  black guys  on the team  they probably  should change  the name  of the team  you know  it's like  they really  should  it's like  glory be 
[00:51:30]  glory be  I'm part of  I'm part of  the Boston  that doesn't  make sense  a bunch of  Irish guys  running around  they're keeping  their racism  alive up there  because they  really should  change that  name  black coach  all black  I don't know  if it was a  white  I think the  white guy  the one  white guy  on the team  I think  he was a  I forgot  his name  but he wasn't  even on the  playoff roster  I think  Scalabrini  was on there  and another  dude  and they  weren't even  on the  playoff roster  it was all  black  what about  Pumpsy 
[00:52:00]  Pumpsy Green  good old  Pumpsy Green  I love the fact  that the first  guy they get  is named  Pumpsy Green  like they wouldn't  have just held  out for some  guy with just  you know  I don't know  Bob Smith  yo  Pumpsy Green  he only played  five seasons  in the May  yeah  how did  Pumpsy do  wait the New York  Mets picked  him up in  63  the Mets  picked up  Pumpsy Green  for 17 games  he only got  eight at-bats  his whole time  in Boston  his hands 
[00:52:30]  was full of  cotton  what's up  Danny  yeah  you got some  Pumpsy Green  info Danny  yeah I was just  reading up a little  bit  Jimmy's not too  far off  they pretty much  used him as  like a pinch  runner  and like used  him as like  a day off  guy so when  one of the  other guys  wanted a day  they would put  in Pumpsy  and they really  pinched him  that's what  they would do  they would sit  there and pinch  him as he's  trying to hit  he's a pinch  hitter  they would hit  him and pinch  him  they would talk  about him right  in front of him  oh you ought to  see him run  we throw him on  the base he runs 
[00:53:00]  right around  put your hand up  for him to stop  Pumpsy's sitting  there  poor Pumpsy  can you imagine  being so insignificant  that no one knows  who the first  black player for  the South  he only had  196 hits  in his career  and they picked  up a sucky  black guy  yeah they just  did it to  because they  were probably  getting starting  to get some  civil rights  pressure  from who  back in  50 what was  it  59  that's late  it was no  civil rights 
[00:53:30]  pressure  cranking  just started  cranking  no it was  no like  yeah there was  no like  political correct  pressure from  back then  it was money  pressure back  then  no one like  goes  why did they  pick up  black people  into the  why would  they get  Pumpsy  Pumpsy sucked  let's say  hi to Scott  in Boston  Scott what's  going on  how you doing  I had a 
[00:54:00]  friend of mine  his dad worked  in the clubhouse  back in the  late 70s  and they  segregated back  then they had  George Scott  Jim Rice  Louis Tiant  and I'm not  sure who else  but like in  separate  area of the  clubhouse  segregated them  put like  four lockers  together  come on  those guys  I swear to  God  when Jim  Rice was  playing  come on  maybe they  just chose  to like  hang out  together  I'm telling  you  that's  no lie 
[00:54:30]  I don't  know if  that's true  Mikey what's  going on  I'm fascinated  with Pumpsy  Green  it's all about  Pumpsy  I want to  know everything  about Pumpsy  Green  where he came  from  where was he  born  what did he  do  you know he  was born down  south  no way he  wasn't born  down south  Oakland  California  Pumpsy  oh no man  that's a  southern name  Oakland  there's no way  he was born in  Oakland  what do you mean  Oakland Missouri  yeah Oakland

[00:58:30]  the Hicks  would be bad  but seriously  I go to  Malden  and it's  crazy racism  there  that's all  Revere over  there  Malden  what we  noticed about  Boston  man  they just  separate everyone  very nicely  the blacks  are in one  area  the Jews  are in one  area  oh we're  surrounded  blacks are  surrounded by  greater Boston  it's just  amazing though  the Irish  are over  here  I've never  seen such  a segregated  city  we're in  the middle  and it's  just  really 
[00:59:00]  oh boy  let's say  hi to  Marky Mark  from Boston  Marky Mark  hey what's  going on  hey  yo so  I just  want to  take notice  to the fact  that  Patrice  is totally  right about  the Celtics  the whitest  they can get  here  in Boston  with a bunch  of black  people on  the team  I got no  problem  black people  but all my  friends  all fruit  and they're  all like  we'll never  bring the  fact  I'm like  yo  we're in  the Celtics  got a bunch  of black  guys  we even  got a  side  roster  guy  who's  white  the fact  that I 
[00:59:30]  bring that  up  I'm called  a racist  in Boston  what the heck  guys  is that racist  I ain't a racist  guy here  but come on  that's  yes you are  you sound very  open minded  am I racist  I'm not a racist  guy over here  we got Larry  in Boston  he's saying  he's a car  carrying white  guy  Larry what  what part  of Boston  I was born  and brought  up in the  north end  is that good  enough  alright  that's pretty  good  an Italian  Larry  he sounds like 
[01:00:00]  he knows  Whitey Bulge  in them  yeah  oh boy  okay he's  he's a car  carrier  he's in the  north end  I can't even  I have to go  around the city  because there's a  toll that gets you  to the airport  on time  I gotta be very  careful  and go around  all the way  around  to the back  way to get  to Logan  I can't even  get a good  sausage over  there  yeah listen  listen man  I grew up  in the era  of John  Havlicek  guys like that  Bill Walton 
[01:00:30]  and back then  and back then  really the only  on the Celtics  back then  the only  decent black  player was  Jojo White  if you want  to go that  far back  I'm 47  years old  I'm going  pretty far  back  alright  Jojo  are you happy  that the Celtics  have a black  team  I'm not  unhappy  or happy  I'm happy  that the Celtics  have a good  team of players  color don't  make no  difference  color doesn't  make any  difference 
[01:01:00]  unless you know  it's the house  next door  I grew up  I went to  Boston Latin  school  alright  I grew up  I had a lot  of black  friends  and I know  saying that  now makes  me a racist  right  but  you know  what  I was  brought up  in a different  era  back then  it was a lot  less tolerance  than there is  now  between the  races  maybe  there's a lot  of  let me ask  you a quick  question  when did  your day  of tolerance 
[01:01:30]  happen  like not  the fact  that the law  made you  tolerant  but the fact  that you  said man  I'm tolerant  now  when did  that happen  I was never  in that  situation  because I'm  not  I'm colorblind  I was never  in that  situation  that didn't  affect me  this is amazing  that everyone  from Boston  that's calling  is just so  progressive  and open  minded  there's not  one guy  that's just  like  hey  listen  I'm not  saying that  I hung  around  with guys  from South  where 
[01:02:00]  nobody of  any race  other than  white  could walk  through  never mind  not just  black  nobody  of any  race  I hung  around  with guys  like that  but that  just wasn't  me  personally  right  all right  Larry  my neighborhood  was like that  but that  wasn't me  all right  Larry  we got to  get to a  couple others  the phones  everybody wants  to talk about  this  we got  I'm white  I will talk  to Patrice  I'm from  South Boston  we got  Nicky  Nicky  hey what's up  guys how you  doing  pretty good  yeah I grew up  in South Boston 
[01:02:30]  actually an old  colony and  that last guy  was a real  sweetheart  compared to  wait a minute  how old are you  and did you live  anywhere near  D Street Projects  D Street  D Street  D Street  well yeah  I mean it's close  it's a couple  blocks away  but I grew up  there in the 80s  so it was really  bad when I was  around  he's a car  carrier  yeah my father  grew up there  during the whole  busing issues  and everything  so you  Ray Flynn 
[01:03:00]  my father knew  Ray Flynn  Kevin White  oh Jesus  alright  let's hear  what he got  to say here  I'm sure  he's heart  changed too  see the whole  Celtics thing  I mean people  don't even pay  attention to it  anymore because  it's sort of  a black sport  so we don't  even really  pay attention  to it  that's the  rational  that's a  real car  carrying  rationalization  this guy's  a real  white guy  it's like  you know  that makes  sense  it's Bruins  and Red Sox  where I'm  around so  that's it man  basically what 
[01:03:30]  he said is  anywhere where  white people  still have  hope  is the  sports where  white people  still dominate  that's the  ones they pay  attention to  the white guy  we root for  the astronauts  he just  wrote off  basketball  on the whole  just the whole  sport  you gotta pick  your battles  it ain't like  when Larry  Bird played  and boy  he was smart 
[01:04:00]  he was much  smarter then  now it's a  bunch of  running and  jumping  let's do one  more  Steven Boston  how are you  he's very  happy  what are you  happy about  Steve  now I'm a  little confused  here  well I'm just  very happy that  Larry Bird is  one of the  greatest Celtics  and he's white  and Kevin McHale  Larry Bird is my  favorite basketball  player of all  time  but it still  has nothing to  do with it  I love Larry  Bird  you were happy  when the Celtics  were white  I mean yeah 
[01:04:30]  I mean they  had a time  but it's a  different age  now  yeah it's  Oz  it belongs  to us  it's Oz  Patrice hit  on something  it's Oz  what is  Boston doing  they gotta get  some white  players  on the team  even if they  sit on the  bench  to get people  in the stands  they need  a white  guy hero  in Boston  they're not  acceptable  you can't  have this  all black  if there was  a white  guy that  came off  the bench 
[01:05:00]  they would  have made  him spectacular  they need  a white  guy hero  hasn't been  once since  that's really  really good  the only black  guy hero  they was  looking for  was Lynn  Bias  Boston was  ready  for Lynn  Bias  if he didn't  die  if he didn't  die  he played for  Boston University  nah he played  for Maryland  he would have  been  he was  better than  Jordan  in college  Lynn Bias  was a beast  some people  say  a beast  Bill in  Boston  what do you  got  hey yeah  I just  wanted to  grew up in  East Boston  I live in 
[01:05:30]  Memphis  and I'm not a  big basketball  fan but I got  friends of mine  who are fanatical  about it  they won't  watch the  Celtics on  TV  they'll listen  to them on  the radio  and just  believe that  like  and change  Garner's name  to Bird  in their own  mind  Kevin Bird  on radio  you sounded  a lot taller  on the radio  where's  Sheriff Branson  on radio  they can make  believe they're  a white team  don't watch 
[01:06:00]  the score  scroll on the  bottom of  another channel  there's my  white Celtics  but they're  black  I don't know  they're black  I only listen  to them on  the radio  coach Doc  Holiday  what  Doc Rivers  some white  sports center  where they  just change  all the names  to make  them nice  and white  never have  to hear  Kevin Garnett  sounds Irish  that sounds  like an Irish  name  jeez 
[01:06:30]  I know  what's funny  about  Pumpsy Green  by the way  what  the name  this is how  far behind  the Red Sox  were  they went  with the  first black  hockey player  in Boston  before  they went  with the  first black  baseball player  what was his  name  Willie  Willie  Zamboni  driver  Cleophus  Zamboni  he was walking  across the ice  look we got  one  the Willie 
[01:07:00]  O'Ree  story  Willie  O'Ree  I believe  what was it  they used  to make him  go lick  the ice  before  they  they put  a different  letter on  the front  of his  uniform  1958  he was  the first  black  hockey  player  in Boston  had the  first black  hockey  player  they decided  to get  the first  black  hockey  player  before  they  went 
[01:07:30]  with  the  first  black  Red Sox  oh  that poor  guy  oh man  that must  have been  something  the crap  that must  have been  yelled out  he must  have had  hockey  blade  cuts  all over  his nose  and eyes  they probably  beat him  that's the only  sport you can  get away  with  having a  fight  he must  have been  the toughest  man  on planet  earth  tougher than  10 Kimbo  slices  because he  played in a 
[01:08:00]  sport where  you can  fight  this position  was puck  we're only  five minutes  into the  first period  and this  is  Willie O'Ree's  fifth fight  and he  hasn't even  gotten off  his own  bench  yet  oh my god  that poor  swollen man  he spends  more time  in the  penalty box  than any  other player  what happened  same penalty  as the  white guy  got  why do  it  oh  Boston 
[01:08:30]  this gotta  be a lie  there's no  way  where's a  picture of  him Danny  it's true  the Willie  O'Ree story  yes  oh you  can't be  oh my god  Willie O'Ree  alright we gotta  take a break  take a little  breaky  a little  break  we got  Ludacris  coming in  you gonna  help us  out with  Ludacris  what do  you need  I don't  know  I know  he's in  Max Payne  oh he's 
[01:09:00]  in the new  Max Payne  we like the  Max Payne  but you know  that Pac-Man  Jones fight  happened  right after  one of his  parties  were added  oh really  Ludacris  yeah  I think so  Ludacris  is what they  call a  renaissance man  in hip hop  now  he's  I don't  know if  he's as  high as  Jay-Z  but he's  about there  he's a  mogul  and I think  he's trying  to retire  from hip hop  he's getting  to that point  I think  alright we'll  continue with  Patrice O'Neill  he's gonna be  at Catch a Rising  Star in  Providence  Rhode Island 
[01:09:30]  go to  Catch a Rising  Star dot com  thank you sir  this week  alright stay  there  Opie and  Anthony  we got  Ludacris  coming in  in a few  minutes  what Max Payne  that's what he's  promoting today  right  very cool  Opie and  Anthony  Patrice O'Neill  in studio  already  877-212-0&A  is our phone  number  Joe B from  Philly  here we go  is it a  coincidence that  the U.S. is  about to have  its first black  president  and for the  first time 
[01:10:00]  in our history  the U.S. has  bad credit  oh damn  see  but he has  nothing to  shut up  see  by the way  I learned  a new thing  a new  term  what  called the  Bradley  effect  never heard  of that  before  oh yeah  I heard  about  the Bradley  effect  can I tell you  what the  Bradley effect  is  go kill  him  tiger  it's  the people  that  will go  in the  voting booth  and do  the complete  opposite of  what they're  telling all  their friends  lying polls  that's right  Governor Bradley 
[01:10:30]  was running  I think  Tom Bradley  was running  for governor  of California  he was leading  in the polls  by 4,000  according to  your people  they were all  going to vote  for him  went and closed  that curtain  and whoops  fell on the  white man's button  you know  that would  be a great  strategy  because  if  their  confidence  is so  boosted  by poll  numbers  they won't  be as  aggressive  in their  campaigning  especially  in the  last few  days  of the  campaign  they 
[01:11:00]  they  you know  what I  mean  those  people  yeah  okay  and  and they  won't  be as  aggressive  which  will  hurt  voter  turnout  and stuff  and then  Whitey  Tricky Whitey  goes into  the booth  and goes  and pulls  the lever  for the  white guy  I've always  rejected  polls  and I  just  and that's  why I  have no  faith that  he'll be  president  but I  enjoy the  whole  what  would  happen  if  John  McCain  was  in a  landslide  a landslide  like  like  what  the  hell 
[01:11:30]  is  this  you  heard of  the Bradley  effect  right  a ridiculous  just like  Reagan  type  landslide  or  oh  they had  a  God  would that  just be  like  well  I'd love  to hear  the talking  heads  the next  day  where they  would  just  be  like  where  is  what  happened  I mean  this  is  just  yeah  hey  before we  move on  we got  more on  Willie O'Ree  the first  black  hockey  player  really  from  back  in  1958  how much  more  could  there  be  well  this is  a great  fact  if it's 
[01:12:00]  true  and we  need to  find out  Fast Freddy  writes  Willie O'Ree  was the  only  right  winger  to  ever  wear  a  goalie  mask  during  play  I believe  that  it had  to be  true  that  was  that  was  taking  slap  shots  for his  face  yeah  oh  that  that's  when  hockey  was  all  about  not  wearing  anything  I  mean  the  goalies  were  barely  wearing  masks  he  had  to  be  the  toughest  person  on  planet  earth  man  he  had  to  be  find out  about  the  goalie 
[01:12:30]  mask  and  Willie O'Ree  they  weren't  chopping at  his  skin  with  those  hockey  sticks  yeah  so  getting  back  to  the  election  so  the  debate  is  tonight  the  last  debate  yep  and  what  do  you  think  is  McCain  going  to  lose  his  mind  and  go  after  him  and  call  him  a  terrorist  and  all  that  well  that's  what  they're  saying  they were  saying  is this  going to be  the one  where he  pulls out  his  relationships  he's had  with  some  radicals  back in  the day  some of  those  radicals  but then  they're  saying  if he  does  that 
[01:13:00]  then  Obama  can  come  out  and  say  that  he  was  involved  in  that  whole  scandal  yeah  yeah  that  whole  debacle  so  they  could  both  trade  barbs  that  way  I  don't  know  I  think  people  are  bored  with  the  economy  talk  out  of  these  candidates  because  that's  all  they've  been  talking  about  because  they  just  jump  on  and  blame  each  other  for  it  and  then  you  get  the  market  goes  up  a  thousand  points  one  day  and  everybody  kind  of 
[01:13:30]  forgets  that  it's  still  pretty  treacherous  but  I  think  little  better  because  it's  all  about  finance  it's  all  about  what  Obama's  going  to do  with  the  economy  and  McCain  no  other  are  there  though  but  forever  there's  been  everything  yeah  I  mean  you  know  defending  the  country  immigration  yeah  immigration  is a  biggie  their  tax  plans  and  then  the  stupid  things  I 
[01:14:00]  want  to  hear  him  talk  about  well  what  do  you  want  in  terms  of  what  do  I  want  to  be  able  to  obviously  exercise  my  second  amendment  right  which  Obama  wants  to  completely  take  apart  yeah  not  guns  it's  the  right  to  bear  arms  people  go  guns  you  gun  people  I'm  just  saying  it's  the  outdated  kind of  thing  it's  the  number  two  it was  made  during  you know  back when  this  country  was  fighting  for  freedom 
[01:14:30]  and  they  just  needed  guns  but  we  don't  really  need  guns  and  slaves  I  didn't  know  that  was  part  of  the  whole  thing  taxes  yeah  taxes  are  big  thing  I  don't  like  the  idea  what  do  you  want  from  the  tax  thing  what  I'm  asking  you  is  not  like  what  is  your  mental  platforms  that  you  want  to  be  addressed  by  I'd  rather  have  a  candidate  that  wants  to  cut  the  ridiculous  spending  that's  going  on  in 
[01:15:00]  companies  that  employ  people  out  of  people  that  have  made  successes  of  themselves  in  this  country  and  then  just  take  that  money  turn  around  and  give  it  to  people  who  Obama  believes  needs  it  based  on  his  judgment  and  his  upbringing  I'm  looking  at  this  like  McCain  two  things  have  happened  Obama's  committing  to  saying  he's  going  to  help  out  the  middle  class  which  is  actually  the  lower  class  he's  helping  out  McCain  is  dancing  around  the  fact  that  he's 
[01:15:30]  going  to  try  to  help  rich  people  keep  their  money  I  can't  imagine  that  if you  go  with  a  platform  of  poor  people  keeping  their  money  you  can't  win  I would  stick  with  poor  people  keeping  their  money  to  go  over  rich  people  to  keep  their  money  you're  buying  the  crap  though  it's  not  rich  people  keep  their  money  but I'm  saying  if I'm  going  to  say  something  I'm  going  to  say  poor  people  are  not  going  to  get  more  time  you're  buying the  hype  though  it's  not  rich  people  keeping  their  money  it's  employers  of  the  country  keeping  up  more  of  their  money  so  they  don't  have  to  fire 
[01:16:00]  more  people  it's  not  the  corporations  it's  middle  class  low  business  it's  those  small  businesses  that  we're  not even  concerned  you're  talking  corporations  but when  you're  talking  about  businesses  they're  middle  class  too  some  guy  that  owns  a  subway  franchise  he's  not  talking  about  that  he's  not  a rich  guy  according  to  Obama  he's  making  enough  money  to be  considered  one of  those  taxable  rich  people  look  if  you're  making  a million 
[01:16:30]  dollars  and  somebody  else  is  making  a hundred  thousand  the  million  dollar  person  needs  to  come  out  of  their  pocket  if  somebody  million  dollars  come  out  your  pocket  more  than  a  guy  with  $50,000  it does  we already  give  every  quarter  it's a  ridiculous  amount  of money  it's  already  there  it's  already  there  the rich  and the  corporations  are paying  a lot  more taxes  than  the middle  class  let me 
[01:17:00]  ask you  a question  so  33%  of  $10  million  and  33%  of  $60,000  you think  that's a  fair  it's  not  33%  for  for  who  for  somebody  making  a million  bucks  33%  we'll take  that deal  tomorrow  we'll take  that deal  tomorrow  I will  kiss the  ass  of the  politician  that lets  me pay  33%  tax  oh my  god  at least  a 50-50  split with  the government  I'm doing 
[01:17:30]  right now  at least  a 50-50  split  you don't  have like  a  Kumia  incorporated  of course  hide your  money  there's no  hiding it  but I'm  incorporated  I have a  corporation  I have that  yeah  what about  the plumber  did you see  the plumber  talking with  Obama the  other day  here's a  plumber  he probably  had his own  business  because he  was in  that bracket  of making  too much  money  as far as  Obama's  concerned  and he  said  he goes  why should  I have  to give  up  my hard  earned  money  for  your  programs 
[01:18:00]  and what  you want  to do  he goes  no  we gotta  spread  that wealth  around  and he  is just  some  poor  ass  plumber  who made  good  you know  he's making  a good  living  but he's  not rich  by any  means  he's still  going out  and humping  his ass  in someone's  attic and  basements  every day  and Obama  says  well what about  the people  behind you  we have to  build them  up  since when  is everyone  entitled to be  built up  on the money  of other people  that are working  their asses off  to make 
[01:18:30]  their money  I'm not  far away  from what  you're saying  my thing  is  if we're  dealing  with  like  your story  your story  is  I got a  weird story  but I'm  saying  a lot  of people  have your  story  though  bum  made  good  okay  so  I wouldn't  quite word it  that way  but all right  we're all  bums  made good  and  essentially  that's  that's  the American  dream  exactly  I'm talking  about this 
[01:19:00]  I'm talking  about  you know  Nike  or somebody  or General Motors  or whatever  taking  their money  and  going somewhere  else  outside of the  country  to pay  less money  to  foreigners  to build  stuff  and taking  American  product  and leaving  the country  I think  is what  needs to be  controlled  I don't think  he's trying  to control  a plumber  how do you  take care of that  how do you 
[01:19:30]  stop these  maniac  things  other than  other than  having them  collapse  and then  controlling them  which now  makes us  sound like  we're  socialists  that's correct  we  the government  owns  Obama's one of the biggest  socialists ever to run  but no  he was  socialist in terms of  what you're saying is  everybody helps  it trickles down  but instead of  trickling down  it's actually  you're helping down  which is kind of  the idea  of communism  but  the socialism 
[01:20:00]  thing  is basically  what's going on  with the government  right now  is that they  own  our property  we have to  answer to the  government  for our  personal  stuff  which is  way worse  than  Obama  trying to  get free  health care  he's  going with  the idea  of utopia  as opposed  to that  corporate thing  which is  come on man  it's not as bad  as a corporation  on the backs  of  who  who  who has to  now support  people  that 
[01:20:30]  either by  their own  means  or  bums made good  and not just you  I'm talking about  look if I get  if I get some money  that's  that's significant  I'm a bum made good  and I want to keep  my money  because I always  but rich  rich people  ain't worried about it  these sons of bitches  think  that we tiptoe around  zippity doodahing  that we don't pay  any taxes  whoopee  look at all the money  I have  I'm going to throw it  in the air  and bathe in it  it's  the tax 
[01:21:00]  is already  ridiculous  for people  that are in the bracket  he wants to tax more  it's already  ridiculous  why the hell  pay more taxes  50-50  partner with the  United States government  and he wants more  he wants more  how about cut  the goddamn spending  I have no problem  with him cutting spending  he wants to cut spending  cut the crap out of it  but  you know  what  why  everyone must be  lifted up  shut up 
[01:21:30]  but I don't think  he's not entitled  yes he is  he said it  I don't think  he said it  but how can he  give me the goddamn quote  how can you do  now  here's what's going to  happen now  is that the corporate  the fact is  capitalism  evidently doesn't work  I don't know if I'm saying  that  if I should say that  no no no  evidently it didn't work  because capitalism says  see you  and everybody in this room  is a self-made person  you don't have a bunch of  employees 
[01:22:00]  and a bunch of this and that  the corporations took  the jobs from the country  and this is what I think  people like me who  understand once I turn 45  I get money  but  younger poor people have to  understand  if you make things in this  country  pay a little more  pay the people a little more  the country would be back  to where it was  when we had things happening  and we made it here  but the fact is 
[01:22:30]  if you pay five dollars  for a t-shirt  but if you try to explain  to somebody  listen if you pay 12  for a t-shirt  ultimately the country  will be better  yeah  no one understands that  you don't understand  that as a poor person  you want to go buy  made in China  for three dollars  and it destroys  the economy  if they would still make  in China  they would just make  a bigger cut  instead of making  two dollars a shirt  for five  they would make  nine dollars  but why not put  that in Iowa  or wherever you want 
[01:23:00]  to make these  why not keep  building here  you know why  because it's a world  economy we're in now  it's a world economy  it wouldn't be  if we made stuff here  how is it a world economy  if China's making it  it's China's world  if we make it here  then it's our world  it's China  it's South America  some South American countries  well just stop being cheap  pay people the money  right  look 50 million  is the same as 25 million  what do you want  you know something  fix that too 
[01:23:30]  because there are reasons  that the companies  don't go with  American employees  because there's too  god damn demanding  as far as money goes  some of these unions  are out of hand  maybe they just don't allow  American people  don't allow you  to just come in  and beat you in the face  with a shoe  because you're not  sewing the night strike  fast enough  it's the fact  that they pay  these third world people  to get treated  like garbage  for 10 cents  and then they sell you  a shoe for $100 
[01:24:00]  why not sell you  a shoe for $150  pay this dude  so he has some  health insurance  keep it  if you notice  once this stuff  starts outsourcing  the problems  start beginning  when we had everything  in house man  this was alright  America was doing  alright  when the wars  were going on  when everything  was being made here  when it was just  you know  Rosie the Riveter  yes  making her bomb  people made money  because we got no  we're not 
[01:24:30]  selling anything  we're only  buying stuff  we suck  because we got no  because the idea  I'll agree with you  on that one  because the idea is  the corp  now  you  regular Joe  rich guy  has to make up  for the fact  that these corporations  took their jobs  and left  now  middle class  poor people  they don't care  about what's going on  because they already  lost their job  so they hope  you 
[01:25:00]  die  they hope  every rich guy  misery loves company  so they hope  that you're going to  have to pay the tax  because they already  lost their health  insurance  they're already  suffering  that plumber  is already suffering  ten years ago  his job went to  India  he can care less  all of this  when I watch TV  and I see rich white  people worrying  I know I ain't got  nothing to do with it  I ain't got nothing  to do with it  because they're not  showing poor people  worrying  it's Lehman Brothers  is going under  who gives a damn  about Lehman Brothers  I ain't got 
[01:25:30]  whatever  I don't know  you do  well  it does trickle down  exactly  as you said  it trickles down  you're worried about it  I'm not  I'm not rich  this is rich people  wearing  see  you got a nice watch  according to Obama  you're rich  that's n word  rich right there  according to Obama  according to Obama  you're very rich  they'll tax the crap  out of you  you know what  I'll take it  because we need  we're just bad  right now  we're not  we're not good 
[01:26:00]  but now that the  you let the corporations  run ragged  now the government  got us  now they got us  it's that big brother  stuff  it's just happening  they're controlling  the banks right now  that's not scary  that's a little weird  that's not scary  to you  that the government  that's not scary  that's a bit weird  private  private  there's no  China's going to  own our homes  because we owe China  yeah  China owns my house  if they come and get it  they got to give it to China  we don't own it  the government 
[01:26:30]  don't own it  the Arabs own it  we're done  I'll agree with you there  I've always said  take your money  and save us  we're doing as a nation  we'll save us  I'm saving myself  save us man  I'm saving myself  bro  saving yourself  means nothing  if the country's gone  what are you going to do  go in your bunker  with your gun  yes  stop it  yes  stop it  I'll be the last man  on earth  you're not Texas  I'll be I am legend  I got the car  I got the gun  all I need is the dog 
[01:27:00]  gotta get the dog  and that's it  I am legend  some nice daredevil footage  on TV  well listen  we gotta take a break  the phone's  man just  just on fire  people agree  with Patrice  people agree  with Anthony  that's a good point  about Obama  looking for a utopian  type of thing  as opposed to  a corporate  type of social  yeah his vibe  is just like  everybody  we blew it  we need to help now  and people  with more  can help more 
[01:27:30]  I know it's unfortunate  but we should have  stopped Exxon  from going across  the seas  we should have  stopped Nike  we should have  stopped  you know  Wrangler  Wrangler's gone  now my jeans  some Chinese girl  made them  and I buy them  and they're still  $120  let's take a break  is Ludacris here  I think he is  not yet  I don't think so  he's proud of his way  alright we'll  continue with Patrice  and Jimmy  and the rest  maybe some of your  phone calls  before Ludacris 
[01:28:00]  gets here  Opie and Anthony  stay there  right into this  it's the Opie and Anthony  show Patrice O'Neill  in studio  and Chris  Ludacris  Bridges  has made his way  into the studio  yes yes  you want people  to start calling you  Chris right  man you know  for the movies  of course  Chris Bridges  Ludacris is a character  within himself  so you know  every movie part  I don't want to be like  hey that's Ludacris  so of course  you know  we're just making sure  we're keeping it  all the way professional  uh oh  that means he's  retiring from rap  nah that's  it's gone  it's done  he's fading out  the Ludacris  oh it's over  he's fading that out 
[01:28:30]  I am legend too  Jack it's coming  a year from now  it's gonna be  Chris Bridges  nah man  I actually have an album  coming out November 25th  so album number 6  man I'm loving it  I'm still loving doing both  so we're just balancing  the two out  that's very cool  start doing any movies  where you're in SUVs  with a bunch of kids  going across the country  or something like that  I mean you never know  yeah  you never know  get a little RV action  yeah  something like that  don't do that please  I know  keep it real stops 
[01:29:00]  keep it real stops  once you make a few mil  exactly  like all of that  just is  let me ask you a question  Chris  am I gonna say Chris  or Ludacris  I know he was Ludacris  it's all good man  you can call me Ludacris  what is the thing  cause I'm sure you grew up  you know hood  what is the thing  that since you've been  successful in the world  that you go  man I would've never thought  I'd be deeply into this  where you go  boy I would've called me  a sellout  listen to me  I eat  coming from where I'm from 
[01:29:30]  eating raw fish sushi  I try to get my friends  to eat sushi  and they just  oh I see what you're saying  you feel what I'm saying  like where you go  uh oh  like you get your toes done  or you do something  where you go  oh man  what am I doing  you know I definitely  never thought I would be  as bougie as like  like you're saying  like eating certain foods  and stuff like that  things that I never thought  I'd like sushi  is definitely one of them  but yeah I feel you on that  but I mean one thing  that I sit there  and say I've always wanted  and I go down my driveway  in Atlanta Georgia 
[01:30:00]  every time  it's just like  thank God  it's like 22 acres of land  15,000 square feet of house  and that just kind of like  blows my mind every time  I mean every time  I go down my driveway  so it's a beautiful thing  yeah I don't doubt it  uh we were talking  we were talking about  the uh the election  and me and Patrice  constantly at odds  on this whole thing  um it seems to be  uh more uh class  against class  on this thing  uh now  you've obviously  made a few bucks 
[01:30:30]  we've been  we've been blessed  to have made a few dollars  and it seems like  we're gonna be the people  that might take the brunt  of this tax hit  if Obama gets  what is this  what is this tricky white way  and to lead him  to be us  why don't you ask him  what he thinks  before you say  hey  because I'm not  putting color to it  I'm not gonna let you  I'm not gonna let you do this  he's got an angle  I like that  I like Anthony's angle  I'll tell you like this  I see where you're  going with it man 
[01:31:00]  my thing is that  everybody gets out there  and votes  and just makes their voice  heard for the next  four years of our lives  that's what's extremely important  do you want to pay more taxes  do I want to pay more taxes  I don't think anyone  some tells me  when you're writing that check  you feel a lot like  like me  that handshakes  I don't think anyone  wants to pay more taxes man  but of course  you know we all  we all play a very big part  in trying to  you know change our lives  for the better  so you know  whatever we have to do  in order to make that happen  somebody's gonna have to  everybody's gonna have to  make sacrifices  basically is what I'm saying  it's just about  which means 
[01:31:30]  that says right there  the black president  listen to you  look he's not  look he has a career  and things  he has to  I'm telling you  I'm gonna  I'm going to  tell you  what a person  with a career  black person  with a career  talk is  we have to make  sacrifices  he doesn't want to do it  but we have to make  sacrifices  we all gotta do it  we all gotta make them  which means the black president  do you want to make  some sacrifices  my friend  there we go  that's what I'm talking about  good question Chris 
[01:32:00]  I make  giant sacrifices  that's great  well then there you have it  I'm already making sacrifices  I just don't want to make  more sacrifices  by pressing that button  that says negro  it's not pressing  the negro button  boy is that a sacrifice  I know you got  top of tunnel syndrome  in both wrists  you are an ass  Patrice  Anthony is the guy  in Crash  that sold the girl  the gun  there you have it  that's pretty much it 
[01:32:30]  right  speaking of movies  Max Payne  there you have it  Max Payne comes out  this Friday  you got myself  Mark Wahlberg  Mila Kunis  Bo Bridges  it's loosely based off  the video game  for all the gamers  out there  but I guarantee you  if you've never played  a video game  or know about it  you're still gonna  walk away from this  experience very satisfied  the movie is  ludicrous  I was psyched  when I heard  they were even  making this  when I first heard that  because I'd played  the game  very cool  very creepy 
[01:33:00]  eerie  kind of a thing  going on  how does the movie  compare to the game  like the character himself  honestly it's like  the game  is one thing  but it's like  the movie  it's loosely based off  the game  but it takes it  to a whole other level  so you know  the cinematography  is stylized  it has that kind of  film noir feeling  you know  that dark  matrix type feel  but you know  the storyline  a man that  his family's  brutally murdered  and he's out  to seek revenge  and he's definitely  destroying anything  in his pathway  to find out  who killed his family  it's a great story 
[01:33:30]  my friend  so I think  you'll definitely  enjoy it  especially if you  played the video game  and you are  Jim Bravura  so do you remember  Jim Bravura  from the video game  Jim was  his little buddy  that would help  him out  every so often  not really  Jim Bravura  internal affairs agent  so it was actually  written in  for a 60 year old  white man  I went and auditioned  for the part man  and the director  called me two days  later and told me  I had it  so you know  I'm in there  this will make you  read for parts  sometimes 
[01:34:00]  you know  just to make sure  that you do a screen test  so that you go up  against certain people  make sure everything's right  make sure the chemistry's  alright  exactly  and the good thing is  I don't die in the first one  as the black man  so it's a very beautiful thing  there's room for me  to come back  if there's a sequel  it's a beautiful thing  what do you think it is  about hip hop artists  that make it  the transition to film  so easy  like a lot of good actors  have come out of rap  well I mean  you gotta think  that when we  we write our own music  of course  so you know  that's kinda like  our emotion on paper 
[01:34:30]  and then we  do it visually on video  so when we do videos  it's already a form  of acting in our own character  and basically the things  that we've written down  like I said  as far as music is concerned  so it's a good transition  half of it is being comfortable  in front of the camera  in my opinion  but I think that's why  so many artists  you know  they make that transition  because they're already  doing a form of it anyway  it's just about  taking on different characters  now is the change  in the name  we're going back to you  it's like Chris Ludacris Bridges  is that more the studio  because like 50 Cent's  doing the same thing  he's being billed  as like you know  a Curtis 50 Cent Jackson 
[01:35:00]  and it seems like  a lot of the rappers  they're trying to get to use  is that a studio thing  no that's something  that I'm trying to do  personally  it's just because  like I said  Ludacris is a character  all within himself  so you know  that's the music side  and when I'm Chris Bridges  it's me taking on  other characters  of course  satisfied Jim Douche Norton  why  it's a good question  Anthony Alitascomia  how much did Bill O'Reilly  cost you in 2002  oof  he probably made me  more money  so thanks to Bill O'Reilly  yeah in the end  he made you a lot of money 
[01:35:30]  absolutely  we were just talking  about boycotts  yesterday on our show  because you know  we're threatened  with boycotts  from time to time  and you know  the special interest groups  what do you think  of that whole thing  with Pepsi  getting rid of you  like I said  man it was a learning experience  it made me want to learn  more about how businesses  can even do things  like that  so I take adversity  and I make it a positive  you know what I'm saying  I think that's what life  is all about  but for them to just go  and just get rid of  just like that  you know  without even like  hanging in there  and seeing what develops  it just amazes us  that corporations  will do that  believe me 
[01:36:00]  it amazed me  when it happened too  but I mean  like I said  at the end of the day  I got life  life goes on  and you know  you just  you keep moving  and you make sure  that you stay successful  so that  at the end of the day  it was just like  a speed bump in my life  but you know  you need some adversity  sometimes  in order to become  a stronger person  at the time though  it's a lot more  than just you know  a speed bump  when stuff like that  happens  because you're  you kind of go  what the  what is  what is this about  like this  dummy  Bill O'Reilly  gets on  and just starts 
[01:36:30]  lambasting you  about  you know  why is Pepsi  hiring him  here's what he does  here's what  but it's like  you know  it's a lot more  when you dwell  so much on the past  and stop thinking  about the future  that's what it is  I'll be honest with you  let's think about  what's to come  and forget about  what happened  unfortunately  that stuff is still  happening  yeah that's why  we bring it up  we're very passionate  about it  I think boycotts work  yeah like  people are all  saying that  stop drinking Pepsi  it's  no 
[01:37:00]  Pepsi  you know  yeah right  alright  what about the  Oprah thing  2006  that was a very  long time ago  but what would you  like to know  about that  let's keep the  adversity going  what about it  that was a general  statement  but you've been  involved in some  very controversial  things that are  worth talking about  we've never talked  to you about them  Oprah didn't want  to empower rappers  and doesn't believe  in rappers and hip hop  I mean  you know  that's pretty crazy  I mean  what do you want me  to say  my friend  well just your 
[01:37:30]  I guess your  thoughts on it  yeah I guess you  could say my  thoughts on it  is that some  people can have  a disagreement  and you can agree  to disagree  so that's basically  what it comes down  to  you don't want  to piss off  Oprah  no one does  no  she's very powerful  I've openly  voiced my opinion  about the whole  entire subject  and that's what  I'm doing now  so you know  yeah  it's not about  keeping controversy  going  it's like a lot  of times  these things happen  and they're  frustrating to watch  from the outside  it's frustrating  to see  especially when I  see other artists  getting attacked  it's really irritating 
[01:38:00]  and they're getting  attacked on content  and when I see  the corporations  buckler  I see someone  like Oprah  who's an artist  who made it  attacking it  it's aggravating  to watch  and it's like  we don't get to  talk to a lot  of the guys  until unfortunately  two years later  and it is something  that people still  associate  like this radio  show has gotten  in trouble  and it's annoying  people still associate  with a lot of  the problems  it's had  man  y'all gotta do  your job  man  it's all good  I'm here to answer  whatever questions  you want me to answer  we've seen a lot  of really good radio  shows go away  because of dumb  things  that's all  it's very important 
[01:38:30]  to us  for her not to  be into rappers  is ridiculous  but you hit back  musically too  on Bill O'Reilly  you hit back  which is nice  it's gotta be  satisfying artistically  to be able to  take a swing  and do it  in the right context  which is  through your work  artistically  I voice my opinion  through my music  sometimes  and that's what  we do  and of course  he voices his opinion  on his show  so we all have  our own formats  of doing things  same way  this radio show  has their own  format of doing things 
[01:39:00]  you know  let's all keep  our jobs  yeah  that seems to be  the goal  that's what it  comes down to  yeah we try  but you know  of course  a lot of people  you know  a lot of rappers  we don't get  open invitations  everywhere  so we have to  fight for  you know  trying to break  that whole stereotype  sometimes  and that's what  everybody has to do  we all have  kind of a stereotype  that's even what  Crash was all about  trying to not  be so quick  to judge certain people  and that's the  whole situation  you know  with the Oprah  situation  and at the end  of the day  like I said  I still have a lot  of respect for her  and a lot of love for her 
[01:39:30]  I mean if you don't  respect Oprah  you have to respect her  just because of what  she's accomplished  in her life  and I just feel like  when it came to that  like that crossroad  it was just something  that we agreed  to disagree on  but wouldn't you like  be able to make  all your money  without dealing  with white folks  I would  god I would like  to get rid  of my white agents  I wish I could  make zillions  just with black folks  I really do  so I don't have to  look at your stupid  faces ever again  that is interesting  that you said that  I really want to  good luck  you end up like 
[01:40:00]  end up like who  like a lot of boxers  wait Don King  made a lot of millions  yes he did  off the backs  of the guys  that didn't want  the white guy  helping him out  so  so  Tyson did give  Rudy the boot  good  that's what I'm saying  man  you can't just say  so  I just want to  so so so  your pants  I don't know  exactly  can I talk about 
[01:40:30]  Crash for a second  because it was  it's a long time ago  though  Crash was a long time  I know  I've done it in the past  we better not  but that was  such a great movie  it was like  it ain't better than  Max Payne though  I haven't seen  Max Payne yet  and I'll be talking  about Max Payne  two years from now  but I haven't seen it  so I'm not going to lie  Max Payne is in  Theor's Friday though  so I'll come back  Monday and talk  about Max Payne  that's right  Crash  we all loved Crash  it was about  I mean it was about  like stereotypes  and not judging people  but it seemed like  every character in that  got redemption somehow 
[01:41:00]  which was great  like they show like  the ugly  stereotypical side  of every person  and then they also show  like every person  kind of getting redemption  it was just a great  great movie man  thank you man  I greatly appreciate it  were you surprised  it won the best picture  you know what man  to be honest with you  it was up against  some really good movies  that year  and I knew we had a shot  but you know  we absolutely  like the whole cast  we were kind of wondering  whether or not  it was going to make it  that's why we were so  surprised when it did  but I knew it had a shot  and I knew it was  a great movie  and it was kind of  one of those  word of mouth type movies 
[01:41:30]  that just built up  over a long period of time  so I was real happy  about that  but no I didn't know  right away  that it was going  to get the Oscar  did everybody get  that money  that situation  worked itself up  that situation  is still going  people didn't get paid  right from that movie  yeah like back ends  oh wow  people stole some money  from Crash  probably a lot  on DVD sales too  because a lot  of the DVD stuff  the actors  are still having trouble  getting all their money  I'm talking about actors  like I can do it  it's amazing  how pompous I am 
[01:42:00]  because I was surprised  that you had to read  well I've done some acting  I don't like to be  called in to read  I'm like they should  just kind of offer me  something  and I can't even get  into a Dane Cook movie  so the fact that  you're still reading  kind of makes me feel  better like well  if he has to read  after some of the  stuff he's done  makes you feel better  yeah but he wouldn't  I have to read  he wouldn't have to read  because you're going  to be reading forever  yeah he wouldn't  have to read  if like in terms of  in terms of rap  hip hop  royalty  if that had to do  with Hollywood 
[01:42:30]  he wouldn't have to  read a thing  but he's a rapper  Hollywood's crazy  they're not like  hey  little Chris  you're wonderful  here  you gotta read  you gotta read  up until  I bet you  every Negro  gotta read  probably except for  Denzel  except  they just fired  Terrence Howard  from Iron Man 2  did they fire him  or did he quit  he fired  I didn't know  he was fired  he was black  asking for  too much money  whiteness  oh jeez 
[01:43:00]  they almost got rid  of Favreau  and find out  what happened  Favreau was  gonna go  well I should  get double  really  cause Marvel's like  hey look  Iron Man sells  himself  we can put  you know  somebody in a  wheelchair  play Iron Man  Jack  we don't need you  so everybody  in Iron Man  that started  standing up  for that money  got the boot  starting with  Terrence Howard  which is  you know  that's how it  starts  replace Terrence  Howard  Don Cheadle  he's not even  the same body  type  he's not  war machine  no but to answer 
[01:43:30]  your question  man  like sometimes  I do have to  audition  other times  I don't  it's kind of  like half  and half  right now  but like  he said  you know  I mean  I've been  blessed to  be in  some good  projects  but I still  you know  I consider  myself fairly  new  and I'm  definitely  you know  continuing  to increase  the body  of work  and just  to pick  diverse roles  and sometimes  like I said  they want to  see you up  against the  person  so to make  sure there's  chemistry  so that's  the reason  that you  would audition  as opposed  to them  just giving  you something  all the time  until you get  to say a  Denzel level  you get any  people that  get like  annoyed at you  or a little  like oh man 
[01:44:00]  look at him  now he's  doing the  acting thing  he's kind  of like  you lose  some credibility  with some  people  you know  what they  call it  in the hood  some people  some people  haters  when Metallica  does a song  that's not  as thrash  as it was  on Ride the  Lightning  people like  they're changing  they're not  the same  band  I mean  do rappers  get the  same thing  from people  who are like  I don't want  to hear you  do hip hop  I don't want  to see you  acting  I don't want  to see you  yeah they  don't want  to see him  do anything  they don't want  to see him  living  he can do  anything  he's dropping  an album  he's acting 
[01:44:30]  there  he's haters  of course  in this day and age  you know you have  a lot of  entrepreneurs  or I call  myself an  entreprenegro  so you know  there's a lot  of different things  we do besides  just rap  and I think  that people  have accepted  that at this  point because  they look at us  as businessmen  so it would be  good to expand  certain things  that you're doing  instead of just  doing one thing  all the time  I fell in love  with Crash  when you guys  were walking  with the pistols  and you're like  we're dressed like  UCLA students  or whatever you said  and then they  pulled the guns out  and robbed them  and took the truck 
[01:45:00]  it was so great  because Hollywood  has gotten so bent  on showing you  every stereotype  and then completely  going the opposite way  like you're crazy  to ever feel  uncomfortable  or you're crazy  to ever be afraid  of something  and Crash  just put it  right in your face  it was just  I can't stop  talking about that movie  it was brilliant  I know  are you a good guy  bad guy  gangster  what are you doing  internal affairs agent  so you know  Max Payne is considered  the anti-hero  I guess  or kind of the bad guy  breaking the rules  yeah man 
[01:45:30]  just doing something  different  we are acting now  Luke  absolutely  I signed on  just to be able  to point a gun  at Mark Wahlberg  and get away with it  so that's really  why I did it  we gotta get  Chris out of here  so Max Payne  in theaters this Friday  yeah  and then Rock and Roller  a movie that Guy Ritchie  wrote and directed  that's actually in New York  right now  limited release  so go check that out  and then the album  November 25th man  Theater of the Mind  album number 6  so  greatly appreciate it  got a lot going on  hopefully Oprah and Bill O'Reilly  will all go purchase the album  you're right there 
[01:46:00]  they did help  Aerosmith did the same thing  they thanked Tipper Gore  when they won  because her complaining  about labeling  and all that stuff  helped push them through  and somewhere else  he thanked O'Reilly  when he won the Grammys  yeah yeah  that's why I said that  and Oprah for that matter  even though it did happen  a long time ago  but hey  it's all good  we're here  if you want to exchange numbers  when this stuff happens  we'll call you the next day  don't even worry about it man  we can get it right on the radio  I'm also a good actor too  so it happens to be  you're acting right now  I'm peeping you out  it's pretty cool  you're doing good  I'm very good  I'm putting my arms open 
[01:46:30]  I'm actually gesticulating  I'm actually very good  yeah  I don't know what to do with your arms  I stink  you know what to do with your hands  when you act  I know we're trying to go to break  but my problem when I act is my hands  I never know what to do  with my hands  it depends on your character  like are you playing Rain Man  or are you playing a basketball  I always try to like audition  like the guy is paralyzed  below the neck  I just kind of sit  something you got to work on man  just work on it  you'll be good  alright it's Chris Ludacris Bridges  everyone  Max Payne in theaters Friday  thank you Chris  thank you very much man  alright quick break  we'll continue  O.P. and Anthony  alright 
[01:47:00]  we're back  the O.P. and Anthony show  Patrice O'Neill in studio  this weekend  Catch a Rising Star  in Rhode Island  AIDS ever  he writes  well that was uncomfortable  Patrice checked out  checked out  that's not a black thing  not at all  because Patrice kind of  tried to do a black thing there  black white  we get a lot of  a lot of celebrities 
[01:47:30]  that do exactly  what Ludacris does  keep it very safe  what is it  you just don't want  I don't know  when you're  and this is  look I've been guilty  of it on a much lower level  because I'm not that far  and I'm not  look let me say this man  I'm not  all I'm saying is this  look I'm going to Rhode Island  there'll be  there'll be  two black people there  maybe  I'm not saying  I'm saying  look it's very difficult  to entertain  and this and that  and keep your head  when everybody  has to be entertained  but I'm saying 
[01:48:00]  in terms of  not every answer  needs to be  political  all the  like who is he  hurting  just answering  something in the real  Oprah doesn't want to  have anything to do  with him  it just  on our level  it's like when  certain comedy clubs  don't pass you  this is for us  whether it was Lucian  who ran the comic strip  for many years  or whoever it is  and then you finally  get passed at the club  and my anger  towards Lucian  once I got  he was a guy  he's dead now  but he ran the comic strip  for years  I hated him  hated him 
[01:48:30]  when I finally  got passed at the strip  I really kind of  stopped bad mouthing him  like I was  I was like  and this was not even  in a public forum  like this  my anger towards  Lucian wasn't as bad  anymore  because I finally passed  good is good  if it's good for me  you were happy  because it was you  it wasn't phony  it was just  I wasn't as angry anymore  even though I would have  been like a little more  likely to bash him  than he was Oprah  but again  it wasn't on that level  and it wasn't public  but let me ask you this  I just want to say  the whole Oprah thing 
[01:49:00]  you made a great point  during the break  you said the reason  he doesn't want to even  talk about the Oprah thing  because there's a possibility  Oprah will have him on  to promote Max Payne  the question I got  for Patrice  how would you have  liked that interview  to go  just  you know what it was  ready  yeah  just  it was not going to  here's what stopped me  here's what stopped me  from being involved  because look  I'm on you guys show  and it's just  not for me  as a black dude 
[01:49:30]  to challenge  Ludacris man  I'm just not going to do it  on your show  it's up to you guys  to challenge him  but when he said  he segued into Max Payne  that's when I left  in my head  when it went there  because  that's what he's here to do  and he has to go do it  at this place  and that's the job  and everything  but maybe I don't  this is what I was saying  off air  maybe I don't want  what I have to do  to get at that level 
[01:50:00]  maybe I can trick  this business  into giving me  a couple of mil  and then take it  and hide it  under my mattress  and then go back  because I don't know  what do I have to do  do I have to be  that way  I don't know  and that way  is  it just wasn't  nothing  significant  was going to happen  but as a comic  you're always going to  talk as a comedian  you're always going to  speak through your work  I'm certainly always  going to speak through  my work  as an artist  he did his attacks  and I'm only playing 
[01:50:30]  devil's advocate  because he did hit  O'Reilly  and he did address  that stuff  through the work  and when you're out  promoting a film  you're out promoting  a film  he addressed it though  we're going to get  the Max Payne plugs in  but the stuff  that has happened  to Ludacris  it hits close to home  with us  we want to know  hey what do you  think of this  really  and what goes  through your mind  and blah blah blah  how could Oprah  not want  a hip hop artist  on her show  and she says  she doesn't want  to empower them  that's crazy 
[01:51:00]  what do you think  he addressed Bill O'Reilly  and he addressed  on the bio  he addressed Barack Obama  he addressed Bill O'Reilly  and he addressed Oprah  in what?  in rap  in his rap songs  that was his  what the interview  should have been  he did it in a rap song  so here  it was like  there's the rap part  which is the whole  Chris Ludacris  last name  the thing is  I'm here as  the actor Ludacris 
[01:51:30]  and he said  that Ludacris  is a character  yes yes  and that  he can rap  as that character  this is how  his character felt  so he's now  separating  what his rap  is saying  to what he's  going to be saying  when he  when he's Chris Bridges  the actor  dude  it was  you were really annoyed  because you  you bailed  because I didn't want  Patrice put his head down  and just  I looked over  at one point  and I'm like  thinking  why isn't Patrice  asking any questions 
[01:52:00]  or talking  because my  I'm the only  it's just  the only honest  mother ever  in the room  no  no  you want to  you want to  try to keep it  real  no  what's the deal  when I talk  it ain't EF Hutton  man  I'm just a  a maniac  a loser  a maniac  nothing I say  means nothing  did you not  when I go on Fox  and talk about  Don Imus  I'm a fool  like no one cares 
[01:52:30]  but  these guys  man  Chris Rock  ludicrous  50  these guys are powerful  man  and they can  say something  when I say it  I'm an idiot  nobody cares  until somebody  who's seen  bigger in the business  says something  but once they reach  that point  they stop saying  and when they get  to that point  it's like  I'm gonna  man  it's just  man who gives  a who gives  a damn  Max Payne  who cares  Mark Wahlberg 
[01:53:00]  will be talking  about that all day  and if you ask  Mark Wahlberg  I wanted to bring  up the fact  you know  he plays a guy  who gets to  point a gun  in Mark Wahlberg's  face  but it was a break  I was gonna say  why  to shoot him  for good vibrations  when he was a rapper  do you know  what I'm saying  but I'm not saying  he ain't keeping it real  I'm saying  he can  he can mix  something up  man  I mean  is it because  I got nothing  that maybe  I'm talking  because I don't  know what's out 
[01:53:30]  there  that's gonna  make me change  so I'm setting  myself up  to be a hypocrite  right now  because somebody  go Patrice  here's a hundred  million dollars  and I never  want you to  open your big  black mouth  again  and I might  go  believe me  we're trying  to pull our  cash  yeah no kidding  why did he  get annoyed  so fast  at the Bill  O'Reilly  talking about  like the past  but that's not  talk about that  already  I know  no I'm saying  like you said  it was the past  and it was kind of like  but for us it's not  we've never talked to you  before and it's  you know 
[01:54:00]  it's good stuff  is it annoyed  and another thing  we weren't doing it  I'm a fan  I'm a fan  of him  is it annoyed  or is it like  when you walk  into a radio show  because we do  an up press on the road  we know how some  of the radio shows  are cool  some are dicks  is it annoyed  or is it defensive  like you don't know  what the show  is trying to do  when they go after  something or mention  something  we know what we're  trying to do  which is just  basically talk about  something  which is what put  them in the spotlight  in our eyes  what difference  does it make  if you go on a show 
[01:54:30]  and they ask you  anything  what difference  does it really  make to you  to me  no different  but we do  this show gets sick  of every time  somebody asks  about sex for Sam  the response is  yeah alright  we've addressed that  and it does happen  sometimes  so that's one of the  where if people ask  you about certain  instances of the  radio show  what about the  voyeur bus  they'll ask me  that in interviews  but if they ask  you about sex  with Sam  Norton  and you're tired  of it  but there's context  to everything 
[01:55:00]  if they talk  about sex  with Sam  to make you  look like  you're an idiot  and you were  fired  it's a different  context  than they want  to know about it  because they don't  know about it  and you know  the difference  most times  I know  but either way  and I'll answer it  but when they ask  for the reasons  of just wanting  to know about it  I don't get angry  I don't get  like  but I'm like  ugh  with this  what do they  because it does happen  or every time  it's brought up  in the paper  it's just a reference  point  but even though  you know  it's just a reference  point 
[01:55:30]  again  it's still  a little annoying  I'm not saying  he shouldn't  I look  I'm a comic  I answer things  differently  why I checked out  of the thing  I'm gonna just  tell you why  I checked out  I'm a fan  that's why  I checked out  you're a fan  of ludicrous  Steve  I'm a fan  what do you guys say  just to confirm  what Jimmy said  when he left  he was absolutely  it was absolutely  confirming what you said  he just did  he wasn't familiar  with the show  he wasn't angry  he wasn't defensive  he wasn't anything  he just  it was his first time  and he didn't really  no he didn't really  get the vibe  but he wasn't angry  and he wasn't upset  he you know  he was just doing  what he was supposed to do 
[01:56:00]  you walk into a room  with a station  that you don't listen to  and again  I've done it  where you're just  not exactly sure  where everybody  is coming from  you don't know exactly  why are they raising this  like what  we've been through this  they're just trying to  start some crap  on my name  I'm not saying that  I'm only saying  because I've been in those situations  you don't know exactly  and I didn't take it like  oh he's trying to  mother eff us  I didn't get that vibe  I didn't either  it wasn't  it wasn't  that's not what I'm talking  I'm saying dude  I had a million things  I could ask 
[01:56:30]  I wanted to ask him  it's just  you know  he's royalty really  in the hood  I mean he's royalty  he is  so when he comes in here  for real  he's a big  big celebrity  but not  here  if I wasn't here  he'd just  oh okay  what's up man  I want to know some  but  I could have drove it  and I was trying to  drive it into that place  where it's like  more and more stuff  but it was just  I'm here for Max Payne  I'm not here to  cause  but  you're already 
[01:57:00]  this is what I'm saying  you're already  caused it  like  we're not  embraced  by Hollywood  it's just  not going  to happen  who's weird though  we  yeah  niggas  I'm saying  you're looking  you're making it that  and I'm saying  that every celebrity  on that level  that comes here  has nothing to do with that  and that's what I'm saying  every celebrity  on that level  who's not black  that's what they do 
[01:57:30]  let me tell you man  Chris Rock  and this thing  we're in the same world  so I gotta be careful  with that  but I'm gonna say  he found out  that he wasn't  one of them  when he did  the Oscars  and  and he found out  that he really  wanted to be  one of them  which is  I watch MTV  and he  he trashes  when you watch  MTV Awards  he trashes  rappers  and he sing  he got the funniest  stuff you can think of 
[01:58:00]  talking about  all the rappers  cause he felt like  an outsider  he felt like  I'm a comic  and I'm gonna hit  these guys  yeah  and he's relentless  and he's ruthless  he did the Oscars  and he  and Sean Penn  gets up  and says  what he says  to Chris  and it  and it flustered him  cause he realized  oh man  I'm not an outsider  I'm trying to be an insider  and he let Sean Penn  hurt his feelings  Sean Penn  if I'm at Chris's level  at that level 
[01:58:30]  where am I gonna go  where can I go  once I'm at his level  if I say to you  if I say  uh uh  Sean shut up  yeah  go play your little  retarded characters  and go stand  go go  go ride your boat  through Katrina  shut up  you didn't think  he was pretty brutal  on some of those people  but when  he ruined their night  yeah but then  yes he ruined their night  but what Patrice  is saying  when Sean Penn  stood up for a joke  Chris Rock told about  we always forget his name  I know  what Patrice 
[01:59:00]  I think is saying  Chris should have  got up there  and hit him right back  hit him right back  because he's an outsider  to Hollywood  right  yep  and we're outsiders  but as a comic  and I'm not saying  I would love to attack  Sean Penn  or see him do it  for whatever reason  he didn't  maybe it just took him  off guard  and he didn't want to  you know  for whatever reason  the one moment  of him not attacking  Sean Penn  doesn't  it doesn't matter  because it's not like  the rest of it  was polite  the rest of it  was pretty brutal  for an Oscars host 
[01:59:30]  I mean even me and Colin  talked the next night  he really  was kind of  crappy to a lot of them  so it was almost like  he came in as a comic  doing what a comic does  and it was only that  one moment  where he maybe not  reacted  because that was  the one moment  of  of confrontation  that  that  them  said  you're  not us  you're them  Sean Penn  it was a them thing  where he goes  his name is  what is that guy's name  Jude Law 
[02:00:00]  I would have been like  both of you  shut up  neither one of you  have anything  to do with me  Jude Law is one of our  finest actors  get out of here  he sleeps with his nanny  I'm kind of aware  Patrice  that deserved a beating  because that was so  ridiculous  but it was shocking  because he realized  that man  the edgy stuff  Chris Rock was doing  during the Oscars  but you have Sean Penn  saying something  as ridiculous as that  how do you as a comic  not go for that  only because  and punch back  a little bit  I don't understand 
[02:00:30]  that the more  black people  do get into  I don't know  Hollywood  politics  things like that  golden handcuffs  the more angry  you get  that  they're doing this  no  you see it  wrong  you see it as  would you rather see  fire hoses and  German shepherds again  no no no no  I mean or or this  there's an acceptance  with  you twisted that up  Anthony  you're twisting that  into me being angry  about  I I love 
[02:01:00]  this is what's  making me angry  because I love  there is no  black hierarchy  of us  there every  there's a black  hierarchy of me  and then we're  in this  but Oprah  is her  and ludicrous  is him  and 50 is him  but I'm not  saying that they  I want everybody  to have some money  I'm saying  what is it  and I said this  earlier  what is it  about that 
[02:01:30]  level  that makes you  not say  anything  fear of losing  that level  yeah  and it's all  celebrities on that  level  you're looking at  him the way  a lot of guys  would look at you  even though it's a  total  you're not the  typical case point  because you're  Patrice  but say most  comics that are  on your level  who are like  still brutal  but you know  guys like us  don't  we're not  stupid brutal  we know  we will tease  people in this 
[02:02:00]  you know  and there's people  who might have  known years ago  why is he doing  this  why is he  why is he not  coming that hard  and that in a way  is he's on that  level higher than us  right  that's what I'm  saying it's  leveling up  and a lot of  celebrities do it  like when they  I'm not saying  he's supposed to  be a maniac  Norton  I mean look  I mean we're  talking about it  but it's like  you know I'm  going to say  the wrong  thing  until I say  the right  thing  I'm not  saying that  he's supposed  to come on  here and go  F Bill O'Reilly  or I'm just  saying  we just wanted  to get his  point of view  on the whole  yeah  that's all  exactly  we weren't 
[02:02:30]  about it  it would be fun  if he did  because we  hate the guy  but yeah  we just wanted  his thoughts  on it  just not  just not  like the  carefulness  I'm not  saying  I'm not  saying a  maniac  I'm saying  the just  carefulness  of just  hey I'm  here for  Max  but like  just the  careful  what  but you know  it's just being  very safe  yeah  and it's not  a black thing  we've seen  it with  absolutely  big white  white stars  you got a studio 
[02:03:00]  sending out  like and they're  saying promote this  and you make it  X amount of million  for a movie  it's almost like  why go through  the hassle  and we weren't  saying attack  over  we weren't  saying attack  alright  we were really  just asking  about it  but if you  walk into a  situation  where you  don't know  the players  it's not like  where a station  the guy's been  on  like Kevin Smith  comes in  and he'll talk  about anything  because he knows  us he's comfortable  when you're in a  situation where you're  promoting this  major film  and you know  in the last couple  of years  it's not like  he's been  doing major films  for 10 years  where do you go  with that 
[02:03:30]  like do you  attack these  icons  now that the  storm has  settled  let me ask you  this  I just  I think he  should have  because all we  were asking  was how do you  feel at the time  you could be  honest and say  you probably  wanted to go  down there  and twist  Bill O'Reilly's  head off  at the time  he cost you  so much money  and that's why  I said  and I said  to him  I went  at that time  when it  happened  like that's  when you can  say yeah  this is what  I wanted to  do  you know  in hindsight  now it wasn't  that big a thing 
[02:04:00]  at the time  that was my  livelihood  this son of a  bitch was  taken away  that's you know  that's  that's honestly  we could  we talk about  Bill Donahue  it's the same  situation  at the time  I wanted to  take his gray  head  and smash it  on a curb  and now  he's been  on the show  and I'm like  you know  alright  he's just  doing what  he does  I'm not  kissing his  ass to get  advancement  anywhere  but time  water under  the bridge  whatever you  want to call  it  but at the  time  and I  can be  honest  still  I can sit  here and  go yes 
[02:04:30]  at the  time  I wanted  to smash  him  okay so  you're right  at the  time  I would  like to  have heard  a little  bit more  about that  yeah  be a little  honest  once  you get  to a certain  point in your  career  and you see  how fast  it can be  and do  really well  but when you  see how  quickly  one of  these guys  one of  these  massive  people  like when  you see  how the  machine works  and how  it can  just chop  you off  like for  you to  lose a  major  endorsement  just because  stupid  all right  it's  you're  probably  hesitant  for no 
[02:05:00]  reason  at all  so that's  considered a  sellout  no it's  not at all  technically  I mean  I wouldn't  I wouldn't  you just  not agree  or not do  it  I would do  it too  can I  ask what  you said  I think  a sellout  would be  if O'Reilly  attacked him  again  and he  was like  oh well  you know  that's just  that to me  you said  a thing  like if  he knew  the show  you said  Kevin Smith  knows the show  let's say  this  if he knew  the show  and then you  asked him  those questions  if he knew  you  he knew  what you  were about  his friends 
[02:05:30]  say his  radio show  friends  asked him  those questions  then what  would be that  maybe  you're just  more comfortable  to go back  there  and know  that if you  say man  I was really  aggravated  I hated  the guy  you kind  of know  that when  you answer  certain questions  you might  not know  where this  show is  going to  take it  or what  we're  I don't  know  I'm only  speculating  because I've  been on  different radio  shows before  and I know  sometimes you  walk in  and there's  a weird  vibe  sometimes it's  a great  vibe  but once 
[02:06:00]  you're on  more than  once or  twice or  three times  then you're  more comfortable  I can't wait  to get back  to that  show  they took  care of  me  they treated  me right  I felt  comfortable  there  first time  in any  show  especially  look the  reputation  for the  show is  very  aggressive  I'm amazed  at how  aggressive  this show  is  when I do  other shows  like Jesus  we really do  say some harsh  things even  on terrestrial  radio  where we  I mean we  really do  address things  with brutality  so a lot  of times  you're going  on a show  that look  people are  aware  this is what 
[02:06:30]  they know  about  Opie and  Anthony  oh those  are the guys  sex for Sam  sex in the  church  they know  the crazy  outrageous  stuff about  us that  he probably  thinks we  know about  him  so I'm  only saying  look I would  love to have  had answers  but that's  why I'm  not mad  about it  that's why  I'm not  because I  didn't feel  like it  was being  he was  trying to be  a dick  to us  I think  that a lot  of times  he just  you're not  100% sure  where someone  is going  I don't  think he  was  I don't  think he  was  I just  it's that  it was  just the 
[02:07:00]  let me  get to  it just  it wasn't  forget  all of this  snowing  and it's  just  so what  did you  feel about  what happened  in your  life  and then  it just  answered  as opposed  to  I'm not  what is  he doesn't  insight  on your  personality  who you  are  before we  get to  the plug  that might  have been  and that's  way more  interesting  to us  than talking  about Max  Payne for  20 minutes  there's a  problem  we need 
[02:07:30]  to get  our listeners  into what  we're doing  and we  know that  talking about  Max Payne  for 20  minutes  is not  going to  get the  job done  I'm sorry  it's just  not  and that's  why you  look at  these bios  and go  wow  that's  something  that's  worth  talking about  and he's  had some  interesting  stuff happen  in his  career  he might  give us  another  angle  these guys  don't  understand  our side  of this  they want  to come  in here  and just  give us  very boring  Max Payne  plug  type radio  and that's  not going to  do him  any good  or us  any good 
[02:08:00]  in the end  see I know  that as a  comic  and stuff  and I'm sure  he's done  a lot of  radio stations  but a lot  of the guys  a lot of  celebrities  do TV  and when  you're doing  TV  it's a  very set  way of  doing it  where you're  on for  6 minutes  or 7 minutes  you get a  little clip  of the thing  shown  they talk  about the  movie a lot  it's very  you know  what I'm  saying  it's like  you know  exactly  what the  drill is  you know  exactly  what the  routine is  when you  walk into  a radio  show  you have  15 minutes  and all  of a sudden  there's five  guys  and they  start bringing  up stuff  from the  past  and the  studios  you just  don't know  exactly  where it's  going to go 
[02:08:30]  I know  why we do  it  we get to  go long  form  you know  I call  that  what you  just  described  who gives  a crap  TV  it happens  all the time  and that's  why I don't  watch any  of that  stuff  because I  know  nothing  is  going to  happen  no I  know  I'm  with you  I'm just  reiterating  look  if I ever  got to the  level  of  respect  and money  and glory  I would  love to  just let  every other  black person  who knows  what 
[02:09:00]  happens  on that  way  what you  got to  do  and got to  deal with  and explain  even  what  even the  fact that  he had to  do  Max Payne  explain that  just tell  me  what it's  like to  be at  your level  and be  black  let me  know  yeah he  didn't seem  to want to  be black  at that  moment  he just  wanted to  be the guy  yeah I know  you're voting  for Obama  well I just  got to tell  you it's  just important 
[02:09:30]  to get out  there and  vote  but most  celebrities  on that  level  would say  that  most  celebrities  it's not  a black  white thing  most celebrities  on that  level  promoting for  a major  movie  with Mark  Wahlberg  or any  we're not  talking about  phony white  people  that's what  white people  do  that's a  celebrity thing  it's not a  white black thing  that's a celebrity  thing  but I didn't even  catch that  because you know  if he says  I'm voting for  Obama  then everyone  voting for  McCain  might not  some of these  people aren't  going to go  see Max Payne  now  or it might  just open a 
[02:10:00]  political argument  I'm not saying  that it might  open a political  argument that you  don't want to get  into when you're  promoting a film  well you know  something  you're promoting  a film  you want people  to kind of like  you know you  a little bit  I think it would  have been good  it would have  been compelling  radio to hear  his point on  you know  a guy that is  successful making  a lot of money  why are you voting  for Obama  knowing that  more of your money  is going to be  taken away  just things like  that  then you get  that answer  well the important  thing is just  get out there  and vote  that was  kind of  it's obvious  he's voting for  Obama  he has a rap 
[02:10:30]  song about it  but it's about  people that might  be buying movie  tickets that are  voting for McCain  and next thing  you know they're  going to go see  some other  I'm with Patrice  on this one  I'm not even  against Patrice  yes you are  you're racist  you can kiss  our black asses  I'm only listening  to his argument  and it's almost  like we've seen  enough guys  who don't want  to go into  certain areas  and they're doing  promo or whatever  for it to not be  as much of a  black and white thing  it's just a celebrity  on a certain level 
[02:11:00]  thing  you get to  a certain level  of celebrity  and you get  exactly what  happened today  that's why  we say no  to a lot of  these guys  because we know  it's not worth it  because we know  we're not going  to get good radio  out of them  oh our music  ended  more importantly  happy birthday  to you  happy birthday  to you  happy birthday  dear Marissa  baby girl's birthday  coin city yourself  another year older  hey over at  Sirius.7  we have  Edward Norton  calling in  I think 
[02:11:30]  in about  45 minutes  which should be  about what I  expect  oh Jesus  that I  expect out of  Edward Norton  that's all  last time he  called in  he was plugging  it was a political  it was an  environmental thing  and I'm like  on Ludacris  the rapper  it's a lot of  things  I'm a fan of  the dude  and Norton  called our show  a couple times  what do you  remember from  the last time  he called  mostly discussing  his view on  environmentalism  that's what he 
[02:12:00]  called  was the  plucks  of environmental  things  yeah  all right  Patrice O'Neill  is going to be  where  Patrice  Catch a Rising  Star  in Providence  Rhode Island  this weekend  I'm going to be  nowhere  Catch a Rising  Star.com  we got to get  out of here  let's go  all right  we'll see you guys  tomorrow  tomorrow  there's a lovely 
[02:12:30]  young lady  showing her  press  boob  boob  boob  boob  boob  naked  chuck them  girls all over  the country  flashing their  lovely boobs  guess how many  boob nights are  in  can  I don't have  those  you are  spectacular  here we go 
[02:13:00]  the show continues  and the discussion  continues  it's all right  it's what we do  we discuss what's  going on around us  why 
[02:13:30]  fuck  it's all good  it's all  light  it's all light  fuck it  fuck you  the discussion  continued  down  57th street  to the elevator  bank  you forgot the elevator  across six  to the elevator  down the elevator  57th  yeah  yeah  we're not even in that  a real disagreement  because as comedians  I love comedians  a guy  Colin  who's a guy  on a bigger level 
[02:14:00]  than we are  who will say  almost anything  to anybody  I love comedians  for that reason  more than I love  any other performers  and what you just  said  it's  I think there is  just an attitude  it's  you're  you're  anti  establishment  kind of  person  or you're not  and  Colin  is big enough  to  or Nick DiPaolo  is big enough  to not cause  himself problems 
[02:14:30]  and I always look at  white guys that  cause themselves  problems  and I go  he doesn't have to  he doesn't have to  but white guys  that will cause  themselves problems  look at Lewis Black  that interview  you played with him  he's causing  he was gonna cause  himself problems  at some point  if it  if it  if it dug into  him too much  look  I wanna  I'm not  man I  it was a lot of  things and like  you said you guys  have seen it all  in terms of  interviews and you've  been disappointed  by many  yeah  my thing is  he didn't  disappoint me 
[02:15:00]  all I just  was like saying  is man  what the fuck  happens  in hot  please  school me  that is  completely  legit  so what the fuck  they do  for you to not  say fuck Oprah  not saying  nigga  you a sellout  you didn't say  fuck Oprah  it's like  I hear it  man  I hear it  Lewis Chris  I hear it  and that's why  I was like  you want me to  call you  Lewis Chris  I'm just trying  to keep him  happy  and I just  wanna know  please tell me 
[02:15:30]  what the fuck  is going on  please  so I can  I can know  to know if I'm  ever gonna be  there or not  please tell me  are you a  Scientologist  are you  what goes on  it ain't talent  and I'm not  saying  I'm saying  it's not  talent where you  go  I'ma just make  it cause of  talent  I used to  believe in that  shit  and I go  god damn  well  you gotta  be friendly  with somebody  yeah  but at what 
[02:16:00]  point  if I have  20 mil  in my pocket  I figure  that I can  like  the whole  I always said  this about  Mel Gibson  and that whole  thing where they  would try to  make him  anti-Semite  yeah  and I was  like wow  didn't he make  a half a  billion dollars  from that  Jesus movie  and I go  how much  money do you  need  before you  can be  an anti-Semite  let me tell  you  if you have  a half a  billion dollars  you want  and feel  you need  a billion 
[02:16:30]  dollars  it's just  the way  it is  Patrice  look  are you  satisfied  with what  you have  right now  and what  you make  it's not  even monetary  it's creative  too  end of the  world money  dude  is 500  million dollars  man  you don't  want to be  out  but let me  tell you  something  creativity  creativity  and I'm  not saying  this to  sound  fucking  conceited  or anything  creativity  will just  fucking  come out  of you  it doesn't  matter  if you're  a great  actor 
[02:17:00]  you don't  have to  sit there  and go  fuck  I gotta  be creative  alright  I gotta  put everything  else on a  shelf  and be  creative  it's just  gonna happen  the bottom  line is  it gets  to the point  where  and this  doesn't  this isn't  a sell out  thing  or that  it's all  about money  and materialistic  things  the thing  is  you benefit  from your  creativity  just because  you did  some people  are very  creative  very talented  they'll go  to their grave  fucking poor  some people  aren't very  talented  and they  make it  it's a lot  of luck  involved  but when  once you 
[02:17:30]  are there  and you're  making a good  living  you got a  nice place  whatever the  fuck it is  I understand  you don't  only want to  keep it  you want to  advance  when I say  creativity  I don't mean  the ability  to create  I mean the  place to do  it  like you  don't want  to be  ostracized  do you remember  when Homeless  Charlie happened  here's a perfect  example  how we were  all  it was scary  because we  knew  nothing wrong  had happened  and yet  it was all  about to be  taken away  and every 
[02:18:00]  one of us  you read  the apology  but dude  you read  the apology  we were all  in agreement  none of us  were being  mavericks  behind this  we were all  like we hate  doing this  it stinks  I wasn't  going fuck  you aunt  don't do it  I was like  please read  it politely  we were all  thinking that way  we're not a  sell out radio  show  we're brutal  but when you  see it's already  been taken away  once  and when you  see it possibly  going to happen  again  it's fucking  scary  we still  would have been  the same  humans  but when the  opportunity  the place  to be who  we are  which is on 
[02:18:30]  this show  could have been  taken away  we were all  kind of smart  about it  and said  you know what  the bigger picture  is  we will have  so much more  time  I understand  in a critical  situation like  that  you're a millionaire  Anthony  well I agree  with Brett  the Vaccaro  voice  but I just  want to tell you  you were going  to ask me  for money  you're a millionaire  right  well I'll answer  that question  Patrice by telling  you this  everyone needs  money  yes  I think everyone  should get out 
[02:19:00]  there and earn  their millions  if you have  500 million  dollars  okay if you  have a billion  dollars  a billion dollars  you are  a multi  yes  millionaire  you're a thousand  millionaire  you can buy  a thousand  things  for  a million  dollars  right  you are  a millionaire  a multi  millionaire  so you're okay  if you live  like a  if you're a billion  you live like a  multi  if you have  500 million  you buy your  fucking mansion  that's worth  10 million 
[02:19:30]  and you have to  keep it up  a million a year  some shit  it's not all  about money  I think  you want to  still do your  thing and be  creative  and you know  we I mean  the fact is  let me tell you  something though  I'm not going to  sit here  in front of a  fucking microphone  and live back  in the apartment  I was in  in fucking  1990  I of course  not  I don't want to  fucking do that  I don't want to  be that  I could be  just as creative  and sit here  and do that  shit  but I don't  want to  fucking live  there again 
[02:20:00]  but it's  about also  like cockroaches  and fucking  shit all over  the place  fuck that  noise  part of it  is about  the goddamn  money  because  that seems  to be the  measurement  of success  in this country  now when you  have enough  like Mel Gibson  has more  let's be honest  more than the  show  he probably  doesn't think  he does  to do what  he wants  Mel Gibson  if he wanted  more money  though  Mel would  make movies  like Apocalypto  which was  brilliant  but he would  make movies  that were  more mainstream  he would  make The Passion  of the Christ  which is not  looking like  it's going to  be a mainstream  hit  Mel is on 
[02:20:30]  an artistic  place  that made  him  millions  he could be  making Lethal  Weapon 6  knowing it's  going to be a  hit  they were just  talking about  that and  they backed  out or something  do you know  what I'm saying  for him  he's ready  to do that  he was one  of the very  rare cases  he's an  anti-semite  and a lot  of the studios  won't distribute  his shit  but he's so  big and so  above it  he's iconic  Mel Gibson's  a bad example  because he's  iconic  some people  are famous  and some  people like  Al Pacino  Robert De Niro 
[02:21:00]  Denzel  Morgan Freeman  they're  they're not  famous  they're not  they're iconic  yes  you don't even  see them  Joe Pesci  you don't hear  from a Meryl  Streep  you don't hear  so if you're  going to be a  person that  doesn't want to  fuck with  anybody  don't fuck  with anybody  but then if  you're going to  be a person  that's on  something where  you're supposed  to be  saying something  and look at  Sean Penn  he's a fucking  maniac with what  he believes in  bring it back  to us  I mean  you decide  what you're  willing to do  I mean 
[02:21:30]  we can make  more money  than we're  making now  if we decide  to go  mainstream  we've had  chances  can we  yes  we've decided  hire that  hole  let's do it  and let's go  I don't want to  get fired  but we've decided  a long time ago  that that's not  our thing  there's a balance  we love money  but we also  like have  integrity  with what we  do with our  radio show  we absolutely  could be  making a hell  of a lot  more money  if we decide  to maybe  soften our  delivery  and go a  little  mainstream  how much  money  is the end  how much  money 
[02:22:00]  can I give  you  right  honestly  and I go  look  I don't want  you around  anymore  in radio  how much  can I give  you to get  the fuck  out of radio  I'll take  10 grand  I like  what I do  I mean the  fact is if  we get kicked  off the air  again  I'll be fine  but I  like doing  this  you have  a payoff  for your  rest of your  career  I don't 
[02:22:30]  think so  and not  because of  the same  reasons  the thing  is  like I  said  if you  have a  million  you want  two  you become  you get a  lifestyle  that then  costs a  little more  it's relative  it's all  fucking relative  so if you  have 10  million  it's rare  chance that  you'll live  like a  multi-thousand  air  you probably  won't  no I  would slowly  start spending  money  it's like 
[02:23:00]  Howard Stern  500 million  dollars  do you think  he's completely  satisfied and  goes I don't  want to make  any more  money  do you  think  no  of course  he does  it seems  like it's  possible  to be  Bill Gates  things like  that  he's very  charitable  and that's  like an  insane amount  of money  that's the  amount of  money that  probably  people go  I really  don't need  any more  money  is when  you're in  that thing  where they  list the  top 10  fucking  people  and still 
[02:23:30]  is the  richest  in the  world  there are  those people  that are  on the  top 10  wealth  list  that probably  a lot  of them  are like  but you  know if  I didn't  make another  dime  but to  be truthful  if the  career ended  you know  and there  was zero  income coming  in for me  no I  wouldn't be  fucking  happy and  I wouldn't  be able to  fucking live  like I live  it's not  and I'm  not spending  a lot of  fucking  money  relative to  what I  make  I'm not  like over  stepping  my means 
[02:24:00]  but I  got a  fucking  mortgage  just like  somebody  that's  working  a job  making  50 grand  or whatever  or two  people working  in a household  they're pulling  in 80,000  they're paying  their mortgage  they're paying  their electric  bills  they're doing  this  doing that  they got  a car  it's the  same  fucking  thing  only it's  relative  it's up  a notch  I might  have a  better  car  a bigger  house  things like  that  but I  can't  fucking  stop  working  tomorrow  but what  makes  what would  make Bill  Gates  you know 
[02:24:30]  like say  if he did  the radio  what  this is  all this is  is me  wondering  Seinfeld  has 250  million  he can  stop  working  because he  probably  can't  have a  lifestyle  that exceeds  that  unless he  goes  lunatic  what would  Bill Gates  do  if Bill Gates  came on  the show  what would  keep him  from going  the nigga  from Dell  can suck  my dick  you have to  face those  guys  it becomes  a matter  I think  for those  guys  of social  you know  you're socializing  with them  once we got  to know  Bill Donahue 
[02:25:00]  we became  less angry  at him  because we  saw him  in a different  way  not just  as this  fucking  guy  this thing  but oh  yeah  he's a  guy  that has  humor  you start  to see  them  differently  because  they acknowledge  you differently  too  so to them  Ludacris is no  longer just  this fucking  black kid  rat  he's all  of a sudden  oh that's  Chris  he's a nice  guy  I had a  drink with  him  he's a  funny dude  we had  fun with  him  they look  at you  differently  too  everyone  sees each  differently  as you're  saying this  right now  I just  realized  something  I'm  irrelevant 
[02:25:30]  Jesus  I'm  not of  the new  world  your old  world  I think  Boston  has damaged  me beyond  repair  I don't  I just  don't  believe  in  white  society  like that  I just  believe  them  the reason  I don't  believe  Obama's  going to  be the  president  is the  same  thing  what you  just  said  made me  realize  that I  just  can't  see  a  different  fucking 
[02:26:00]  America  I can't  see it  I think  I'm  being  really  honest  man  I just  think  I'm  irrelevant  you're  irrelevant  you don't  want to  get your  hopes up  and be  hurt  that's  not  irrelevant  to not  want to  be  disappointed  to not  want to  love  something  so much  or want  something  so much  that when  it's not  there  it really  hurts  that's not  irrelevant  I mean  I don't  consider that  to be  irrelevant  I just  think  I don't  know  you speak 
[02:26:30]  your mind  Patrice  you've  always  spoken  your mind  on  Tough  Crowd  you  you  spoke  your mind  and yet  you weren't  you  you played  the game  in the sense  where you  knew what  you had  to do  to be  successful  on the  show  but you  you always  spoke  your mind  I just  want to  clear things  up on  Pal Talk  Patrice  didn't say  I'm an  elephant  so don't  don't say  that  I'm lost  why  seeing 
[02:27:00]  ludicrous  is a big  gentleman  like that  what does  Patrice  want for  this country  or for  you  what does  seeing  ludicrous  like that  do to  you  because  it  affected  you  in a  way  it  was  like  you're  looking  at it  differently  than I  am  but it  seemed  like it  hit you  in a  different  way  I  just  you  wanted  him  to hold  true  to who  he  is  I  just  want  when  he's  hanging  out  with  his  friends  and  not  hanging  out  with  the  Hollywood  and  I  just  maybe  I  just  feel  like  if 
[02:27:30]  I  make  something  it's  more  than I  should  have  made  and  if  I  make  millions  in this  country  and that's  what I  mean  I  just  this  is a  world  and I  love  America  because  there's  nowhere  else  where  a  motherfucker  like  me  could  make  money  you  know  talking  yeah  and  you  know  so  this  is  not  an  anti  American  this  is  just  I  think  this  country  niggas  are  villains  man  you  think  that  I  think 
[02:28:00]  niggas  are  villains  and I  think  motherfuckers  who  make  it  are  still  villains  I  think  Oprah's  a  villain  to  this  country  I  think  that  she  is  trying  her  best  and I  think  Obama  shows  you  how much  a  villain  we  are  because  it's  going  to  take  white  people  to  make  him  the  president  it's  going  to  take  white  people  to  put  him  where  he  needs  to  be  and  and  it's  real  I  don't  I 
[02:28:30]  think  being  a  black  celebrity  is  not  real  it  takes  white  people  to  accept  you  or  go  into  the  movie  theater  and  pay  the  tickets  like  you  just  don't  like  the  idea  that  white  people  have  to  put  these  people  over  that's  a  numbers  game  though  it is  it's  the  idea  it's  the  idea  that  I  look  you  think  there's  still  a  big  control  issue  I  consider  more  white  guys  to  be  in 
[02:29:00]  this  world  right  now  than  black  people  I  got  two  three  black  friends  maybe  left  because  I  had  to  leave  Boston  that's  where  my  friends  are  most  people  I  deal  with  are  white  you  know  yeah  and  it's  not  I'm  not  delusional  about  it  I'm  just  saying  we're  not  accepted  dude  we're  not  accepted  no matter  what  ludicrous  does  and I  just  use  him  as  a  euphemism  for  all  of  no  matter  what  he  does 
[02:29:30]  he  gonna  be  a  nigga  man  to  the  people  who  he's  trying  to  not  be  a  nigga  to  but  who  though  to  whatever  that  magical  to  the  great  odds  I  don't  fucking  know  but it's a legit question  because like  Lewis Black  was saying  people lump in the  government  and they  look at  the  government  as  this  entity  yeah  who are  the  people  I'm a  white  guy  I have  no clue  so  maybe  that's  what I'm  afraid  of  I  don't  want  to  look 
[02:30:00]  if  this  business  really  is  a  beast  I  would  think  Oprah's  in the  belly  she is  she's  as deep  inside  of the  beast  hell yeah  I'm not even  in the mouth  really  I think  I'm just  still running  around  waiting to be  food  and  you're  like  but she's  not a  bed bug  on the  tip  of  the  nose  she  has  done  something  but all  it will  take  is  one  thing  for  white  people to 
[02:30:30]  go  naughty  naughty  nigga  no matter  what you  do  you might  as well  just be  you  and make  that money  and that's  what he was  doing  and I  and look  I've been  there  I understand  all that  shit  I understand  not having  a fucking  dime  that a  motherfucker  gives you  you know  my girl  would tell  you  I used  to sit  up  with headaches  worrying about  money  yeah  but at the  same time  motherfucker  called me  and go  Patrice  we need  you to  do this  this  and the  third  like I  stopped  doing  web  junk  because 
[02:31:00]  I couldn't  talk about  Chinese people  kicking each  other in the  balls  no more  I was  done  and I  said look  for me  to do  this  this is  how much  money  I'm  gonna need  to continue  to lie  the first  two things  that web  junk  I kept  I  I was  honest  the next  thing  I was  lying  and I  said this  is how  much  you gotta  pay me  to lie  and  and that  money  was  goddamn  good  watching it  come in  those checks  every week  oh my 
[02:31:30]  goddamn  look at  this  and  once I  decided to  stop  I  stopped  and  I'm  not  holding  everybody  to some  standard  dude  because  there's  things I've  done that I  shouldn't have  done  but I'm  saying what  the fuck  man  when you  get to  this level  and you  don't share  with other  black people  share  just information  what the  fuck  is going  on  for you  to be  at the  level 
[02:32:00]  that you  are at  Will Smith  please  please do  me a favor  how did  you become  this big  and please  don't say  it's just  talent  where you  get to be  a nigga  on screen  for an  hour  and 25  minutes  until the  first other  person  comes  just a  nigga  and some  monsters  did you  want  something  from  ludicrous  like  not  something  you know  what I'm  saying  you seem  to be  taking  him being  a typical  celebrity  in a really  personal  like 
[02:32:30]  is it  like  I want  to be  proud  of  anybody  who makes  I want  motherfuckers  to at  least  let me  know  that  there  are  some  despites  if that  makes sense  that I  made it  despite  I'm in  here  despite  something  man  I'm in  here  I wanted  my dumb  ex-managers  man to 
[02:33:00]  make it  with me  and I  it couldn't  happen  I want  black  management  black  eight  I want  that  I want  it  I want  the shit  I want  black people  to be  respected  man  and he's  a respected  black man  respected  loved  and I want  the motherfucker  to come in  and say  this is how  you get  to be  that  and  and I  respect  ludicrous  man when I  watch him  but then  in this  forum 
[02:33:30]  I watched  him  and I  didn't  respect  him  but how  is he  not saying  that by  doing what  every other  celebrity has  to do  it's not  every other  celebrity  it is  we've had  enough  how is he  not saying  that  this is what  you gotta  do  people  it's  different  not when  you're that  on that  level of  celebrity  they're all  the same  on that  level of  celebrity  as far  as the  way they  answer  questions  and you're  reading into  it from a  black white  issue  and I'm 
[02:34:00]  saying  maybe he  is telling  you  this is  how you  get  respected  you don't  say stupid  shit  or you  don't get  controversial  when you  don't need  to  or in  situations  where it's  not necessary  maybe that  was an  example of  how to  do it  maybe that  was an  example of  how to  do it  you know  what though  we don't  we don't  operate  this is what  I tell  people about  Boston  if I had  to teach  a white  class  and not  just like  if I had  to really teach  black people  how to be  proactive  is to 
[02:34:30]  understand  passive  aggression  that's one  of those  things that  white people  will have  over you  and I  learned this  by getting  in trouble  unfortunately  with the law  and I had a  probation officer  and I realized  Skagnetti  Skagnetti  and I realized  no matter what  this is what  bothers me  I guess  and again  my training  from Boston  and a lot  of people  don't have  if you lived  in Brooklyn  your whole  life  you don't  have white  people training  you just 
[02:35:00]  hang around  niggas  till you  don't  and you  see white  people  and go  oh shit  oh  white people  that motherfucker  when I came  in angry  the angry  fucking  the victimized  angry  fucked over  by the system  nigga  right  when I came  in there  and I was  being that  and I was  fucking salty  and I was  looking at him  like I wanted  to kill his  whole family  things were  bad 
[02:35:30]  when I came  in there  finally  got just  tired of it  and he sees  I go hey  good morning  they beat me  down  I finally  changed my  name to  fucking  Toby  he didn't  give a fuck  about  what was in  my heart  he didn't  give a fuck  what was  behind my  eyes  as long as  I came in  and smiled  and said  hello sir  he didn't  give a fuck  about as  long as I  came in  there  and I  smiled a  big fucking  smile  and made  him feel  comfortable  everything 
[02:36:00]  was okay  and that's  what I  learned  when I  was 17  that white  people don't  give a fuck  they don't  give a fuck  no matter  what you  do  no matter  what you  do  Floyd Mayweather  was talking  about  white people  just want  and when I  say white  dude  again  I say  this on  stage man  white people  when I  say white  people  they ain't  you  motherfucker  jerry  the trucker 
[02:36:30]  shut  the fuck  up  john  the milk  man  shut  the fuck  up  white  people  you  happen  to  use  the system  that fucks  you too  but makes  you think  that you're  one of them  it's  it's  it's  that's  what's  they don't  give a fuck  and I'm  looking at  ludicrous  like man  they don't  give a fuck  no matter  what you  do  you're doing  the right  thing  yes  but it  don't  even  fucking  matter  did you  ever think  that the way  you're looking  at it  though  has been  skewered 
[02:37:00]  and maybe  I just  said I'm  irrelevant  I'm not  saying irrelevant  but I'm  saying without  saying irrelevant  or going all  that way  maybe the way  you're looking  at it  is 50%  right  but the other  50%  that you're  lumping in  there  is not  right  because again  when you talk  about Obama  how white  people have  to put  people like  the guy  it's like  it's not  as black  and white  with every  single issue  he's doing  even though  it doesn't  let me tell you  something  the only thing  black he's being  Obama 
[02:37:30]  and I understand  this  because he needs  to be the  president  the only thing  the only thing  black he's doing  is being black  and he's still  a nigga  none of them  are that honest  but again  on that level  none of them  are honest  none of them  not one white  guy comes out  and says a  fucking honest  word either  not one guy  on that level  and these are guys  who are part of the system  who are as accepted  as you can be  they get thrown out  Trent Lott  said one wrong thing  you can't be more in 
[02:38:00]  than Trent Lott was  he said one  wrong thing  out  they throw each other out too  on that level  it is disloyal  to everybody  yeah but they don't  throw an entire  fucking  culture out  see  you're right  a lot of times  white people will give up  white people will give up  one of their own  just to make a big  like okay  we're gonna trade  alright niggas  here we gonna trade you  this is why I spoke up  against this whole  Imus thing  it's like  I don't  this is our platform now 
[02:38:30]  Don Imus  we will trade you  one old white man  saying nigga  and an old television icon  saying nigga  for  you never  saying nigga  the fact that  black people  own language  own language  we can say  anything we  fucking want  that was the  reparation  reparation  was the fact  that we can  be honest  about  what  has happened  to us  and white people  can't be honest 
[02:39:00]  so the fact is  white people  are sitting there  going  man I can't  say nigga  how the fuck  we gonna stop  niggas from  saying nigga  now  I'm not gonna  say that  Bill  the fucking  cable guy  is doing this  and thinking of this  but I'm saying  at some point  do you believe  that white people  are gonna let  niggas run around  doing shit  that they can't do  so what happened  was we will  trade you  one Imus  and one  Michael Richards  for the fact that  you can't say  nigga no more 
[02:39:30]  and we're gonna  invent a euphemism  for nigga  that I'm gonna  say way more  than I ever  said nigga  in my life  which is n-word  but the you  you keep saying  was pushed  by Jackson  and Sharpton  the you  so you  was pushed  by the NAACP  that wasn't  white people  didn't push that  that's why I got  mad  because that's  that whole thing  was irrelevant  out of date  niggas  dealing with  irrelevant  out of date  white people 
[02:40:00]  and that's who's  doing shit now  me and Patrice  have to go to  the old racist  home  because  I feel as  irrelevant as you do  Al Sharpton  made a deal  we're gonna hear  what the deal was  get rid of  Imus  get rid of  this motherfucker  we trade you  two big white  icons  here's what we  want  we want a  couple of  goofy niggas  on MSNBC  to read the  news  and we want  black people  to not be able 
[02:40:30]  to say nigga  if we can't  and the radio  why is it if we  can't though  why is it still  a white person  pushing it thing  when you look at  rap lyrics  Sharpton and Jackson  those guys  were targeting  which is why  I was so  aggravated at  rappers  they were  targeting it  way more  than white  society was  the white  people got  mad about  the cop  killing shit  but with  the word  nigger  was all  black people  pushing that  the only place  you heard it  was like  in a bar  somewhere  it was like  well if  they can  say it  why can't  we say  that's where 
[02:41:00]  you heard it  from Whitey  but then  everyone else  Jim's right  it was  fucking  Jesse  it was  those guys  didn't I  just say  that though  yeah  yeah  but you  can say  if we  don't say  it  you can  never say  it  but it's  not  see again  I'm saying  white  is  look  I said  this a million  times  the thing  the thing  that makes  us angry  and a lot  of us  don't even  know it  see  Jews  the thing  that was  good about  the Holocaust  and listen  to me 
[02:41:30]  Jesus  I don't  fuck that  man  just  if it is  Jews  listening  and ready  to say  something  I know  where you're  even  back in  the pyramid  days  Jews  had a  villain  it was  Pharaoh  and it  was  Hitler  so you  can look  at a  motherfucker  it was  so much  Hitler  that a  motherfucker  can't  even have  the  Hitler  mustache  it was  it was  names  it was  Himmler  it was  Heydrich  it was  Rommel  it was  fucking  Mingler  it was 
[02:42:00]  a bunch  of  motherfuckers  these  motherfuckers  and  their  cronies  who  were  the  villain  right  black  people  when we  say  white  the  color  white  is  like  the  mustache  except  for  there  was  no  crime  ever  committed  there  was  no  crime  ever  said  to be  done  it  was  we're  gonna  own  you  now  we  don't  goodbye  all  we  got  left  is  your  skin  color  I  don't  look  at  you  as  an  oppressor 
[02:42:30]  white  people  when I  say  white  it  is  it's  vague  it's  not  even  you  I  wish  I  could  move  on  not  every  German  is  looked at  like a  Nazi  because  Nazis  were  defined  whiteness  was never  defined  and  as far  as the  world  changing  everything  is internal  man  you have  internal  changes  when the  fuck  has there  ever been  an internal 
[02:43:00]  change  in this  country  in terms  of  how we  feel  about  each  other  I  don't  like  being  a  villain  man  I  don't  like  feeling  like  a  villain  no matter  what  I  do  there's  been  this  huge  change  over  time  in your  own  lifetime  there's  been  a huge  change  that I  see  I  see  it  on  the  street  if  you're  a  golfer  a white  guy  golfer  from  1910  and then  the fact 
[02:43:30]  is that  somebody  decided  now  niggas  can  golf  where's  the  change  other  than  niggas  can  golf  the  change  is  that  it's  not  this  thing  where  we  need  the  national  guard  every  time  a  tiger  woods  tees  off  but  it's  legislation  and that's  change  but people  going  you act  like  someone  puts down  a law  blacks  do  this  you said  there's  no internal  change  when  something  like  that  happens  that's  what  I feel  they do  but  it's  not  tigers  embraced 
[02:44:00]  white  people  don't look  at it  like that  I'm a  white guy  it's not  a matter  of  he was  embraced  by  fuzzy  zeller  when he  called him  chicken  eating  okay  that's  fuzzy  zeller  golf  is a  fucking  shitty  example  you talk  about  internal  change  in a  society  people  having  internal  change  do you  really  think  that  everyone  is  only  going  by  the  letter  of  the  law  stuff  that's  wrong  here's  my  problem  there  is  no  gray  area  you don't  credit  that 
[02:44:30]  no I  do  there's  no  gray  area  white  people  meaning  this  either  I gotta  deal  with  and not  you guys  I gotta  deal  with  fucking  nigger  or I gotta  deal  with  I've never  even heard  the word  yeah  I'll give  you that  I wanna  deal  with  an  honest  fucking  I'm not  a racist  wanting  everybody  to die  racial  white 
[02:45:00]  person  I've  never  met  a  run  of  the  mill  racial  white  person  who admits  that black  people annoy  him  but doesn't  hate  black  people  exactly  let me tell  you  I'll be  completely  honest  with you  when I'm  driving down  the street  I'll be  partially  honest  I'll be  partially  honest  with you  when I'm  driving down  the street  and I  get cut  off  or  some  Asian  guy  is in  the car  in front  of me  just doing  that  fucking  30 mile  an hour  shuffle  down the  expressway  I will 
[02:45:30]  look at him  and just  blurt out  a horrible  Asian  epithet  I'm in my  car  he doesn't hear  it  it's not  hurting  anybody  I don't  give a  shit  it makes  me feel  better  fuck it  but  that doesn't  mean  I'm like  wow  fucking  Asians  fucking  I'm not  doing that  if a  black guy  is doing  the same  thing  cuts me  off  fucking  or some  fucking  little  thug  motherfucker  is crossing 
[02:46:00]  against the  light  and doing  the little  shuffle in  front of  my truck  so I  can't  fucking  move  oh you  damn  well know  what's  going  through  my  fucking  head  but  I'm not  going to  look at  the next  guy  on the  sidewalk  and go  you're all  fucking  I'm not  going to do  that  I don't  I don't  feel  I don't  feel that  I don't  feel that  black people  like Oprah  I don't  think  I don't  feel they  owe money  I mean  I don't  feel a  motherfucker  owes me  their money  or owes  black people  but I do  feel like  I owe 
[02:46:30]  my mentorship  to  a motherfucker  underneath me  I owe  how do you  distribute that  to people  I don't  know  how do you  then distribute  how does  ludicrous  then distribute  that to  you  and say  alright  because you're  talking  he made  it  what's  the  machine  let me  in on  the  secret  I don't  even think  that  motherfucker  knows  what the  secret  is  I think  he just  made it  and went  holy shit  look at my  house in my  driveway  and you know  you know  there's this  machine  you know  that I  can't tell  you how 
[02:47:00]  the fuck  I got  sitting  here  I can't  when I  was doing  construction  see white  people  the beautiful  thing about  being white  on that  level  is that  you  you don't  white people  get to be  individual  there's  nothing that  you do  that  represents  an entire  group  and when  an entire  group  is still  trying to  figure out  their place  in some  ways  I just  feel like  if you  that question  I asked  them which 
[02:47:30]  had sellout  in it  but I was  getting at  is  you know  no not  sellout  I'm sorry  about that  but what  do you  do  different  and you  go  wow  shit  nigga  I get  my feet  done  every week  that's all  I was  looking for  because you  know what  that would  help  some nigga  on the  street  who's  keeping  it real  who love  ludicrous  and that  motherfucker  go  shit  man  every week  a face  you'll do  me good  nigga  that's all  he owe 
[02:48:00]  all he owe  is to get  this young  man  who's  on the  corner  man  who don't  believe in  nothing  who don't  believe in  nothing  just to say  you know  what  wow  I like  I like  that group  Leonard Skinny  man  I don't know  I like  that music  I like  the way  that you  think  I like  some corny  shit  yeah I watch  Yogi Bear  coming up  just a  motherfucker  that you  think  keeps  it  hood  just say  look man 
[02:48:30]  I really  like  maybe he  does that  but just  not through  the vehicle  of your  question  maybe he  does do  that  through doing  films  and for being  an Oscar  winning movie  that's not  enough  but maybe  and he's also  again I have to  defend the guy  because he has  attacked  in his work  he has  attacked  it's not like  he laid down  and praised  O'Reilly  this is not  about  ludicrous  though  it's just  cause he  do you think  then Ice Cube  is looked at  so people  could go  I could be  in goofy  shit  and look 
[02:49:00]  like an  idiot  climbing up  the ladder  and falling  down off  the roof  no you  know why  cause Ice Cube  doesn't go  look man  let me explain  to you  what's going  on  here's what  a motherfucker  on the street  look cause I'm  in the middle  I'm getting  to the place  where  oh here  these motherfuckers  come get ready  to rob me  I'm looking at  young killers  like shit  and they don't  know me  so what the fuck  they gonna do  but rob me  and shit  but Cube 
[02:49:30]  his thing is  they looking at him  like nigga  that motherfucker  this is what  I want to stop  do you understand  like look at this  motherfucker  doing this goofy  ass out of the air  yeah  nigga  what the fuck  but Cube  is 40 something  he's not a killer  no more  he used to be  a killer  so please let me  know  what it's like  to used to be  a killer  and then something  happens and you're  not a killer  no more  and ultimately  please  just let me  know  how to get 
[02:50:00]  some place  without  having to be  lucky enough  to once  had been a  killer  and then I  rapped  cause right now  rap  is the only  cause he said  Ludacris said  something  he goes look  I'm a young  black entrepreneur  please  just  throw the  other shit  in there  cause I know  I can't freestyle  rap worth a fuck  and not everybody  I know is a funny  motherfucker  and not everybody  I know can dunk  so please  let me know  and that's  that's doctors  that's pilots 
[02:50:30]  black pilot  nigga talk to me  talk to me  what the fuck  please tell me  how you decided  to be  cause we need  an us  kind of thing  beyond  the negativity  but a  a positive  us  I think a lot  of the things  you're bringing  up though  are basic  human things  and not so  race based  like the whole  thing  easy for you  to say  no I think  they are  like how do  you go from  killer  to making  goofy movies  like that  the guy is  he's in his  40s now  it's called 
[02:51:00]  what  mellowing  with age  or this  I don't think  it has to do  with like  motherfuckers  don't know  about that  good credit  let's take  good credit  alright  my mother  had to  co-sign me  a truck  when the  bill collectors  used to call  when I had  no credit  didn't know  what it was  didn't know  how to get  it right  they call  and I go  suck my dick  yeah really  I used to  listen to  American Idol  with them  I used to  be sitting  there going  wait let  this motherfucker  finish singing  I'll talk  to you after  this  get back  on the phone  laugh at  him  fuck with  him  and then  one day  I looked  my credit  said seven 
[02:51:30]  something  and I went  holy shit  then I had  to figure out  how to be a  motherfucker  you know what I mean  and I have to  share with somebody  what I used to do  and then what  happened I had to  get co-signed  by my mama  who got her  credit right  by waiting  15 years  you know what I mean  I just get  just a little  information man  again that's a  human thing  I fucking  the car I slept  in was repoed  dude  because of my  credit was shit  it's human  experience I know  man but again 
[02:52:00]  what white people  can't do  is  and what black  people can't do  either  is separate  the color  thing  from  the issue  like I know  dude I know  your story  I'm not looking  at you like a  white  like I said  you're a fucking  bum made good  and I say that  with all due  respect man  that's what this  country is  is bums made  good  but once you  make good dude  you owe  somebody something  once you make 
[02:52:30]  good  you owe  something  not your money  you owe something  you owe  listen we gotta  break in  you're absolutely  right  we got Ed Norton  on the line  here  Edward  Edward  how you doing  man  we're having  an intense  conversation  about black  and white  and race  and Obama  and McCain  it's getting  pretty good  in here today  Opie Anthony  Jim Norton  Patrice O'Neal  how you doing  today 
[02:53:00]  I'm good  you guys  good  good  we had  here's what  this is about  we had  Ludacris  come in  and  do you want  to  when you're a  celebrity  you're a big  star  does there get  to be a point  where you don't  want to talk  about certain  things publicly  because of  what it can do  to you  or what the  overall  consequences  of it  can be  you know  I don't worry  so much  about that  but I also  like don't  necessarily  think that  you know  I mean it 
[02:53:30]  depends on how  you talk about  it  I think  you got to  sacrifice a bit  of honesty  is that like  I just think  you know  I don't always  think that my  opinion is  necessarily  what the world  needs  you know  what I mean  I don't take  that  that's a good  point  because there's  this credibility  issue I think  is kind of what  we were talking  about  where people  now Ludacris  especially now  working his way  up to be  being you know  in movies  doing movies 
[02:54:00]  and it seemed  to Patrice  like he's kind  of not being  as honest  as he used  to be  in order to  keep that  that bit of  celebrity  and success  going  let me make  sure  you're not  don't  because this  is a dangerous  thing  I don't  it's not I'm  saying he's  being dishonest  I'm saying  what is it  what is it  that once you  get to a certain  level in this  game  I just want  to know  what it  is  where you  just  can't 
[02:54:30]  say  shit  that's  that really  impacts  and you talk  about having  an opinion  Edward  it's like  your opinion  does need  to be heard  because in  this business  perception  so because  I'm just a  crazy useless  motherfucker  talking  because I'm  perceived to  be nothing  in the game  but a man  who got  respect  Oscar  nominations  this that  your opinion  is valuable  valuable 
[02:55:00]  I don't  I don't  think it's  less valuable  than anybody  else's  but I guess  my point  is  the only  thing is  I try to  make sure  I'm actually  informed about  what I'm  talking about  you know  what I mean  because people  will ask you  your opinion  for a lot  of things  and I think  sometimes people  reflexively  answer  they'll like  just answer  just because  they got  asked  and not  enough people  say  you know  what I don't  I don't  really know  enough about  that  to speak  with standing  on it  but  things I feel  like I know  enough about  I'll give 
[02:55:30]  a perspective  on  I mean I  agree  like  look you know  we're in  some perilous  times  and I definitely  think it's not  a moment for  people to keep  quiet  I agree with  that  you're cautious  because you know  you're Edward Norton  you know people  are going to ask  you and listen  to things  you have to say  about subjects  that they wouldn't  listen to the  average person  about  regardless of  how informed  you are  like so you're  more careful  about answering  because you  don't  I also think  you know  on a some  level  you just  got to be  careful  like people 
[02:56:00]  give you a  platform  for one set  of reasons  it doesn't  it's great  I think  you know  I'll tell you  something I admire  about Barack  Obama  very sincerely  which is  I think he  I think he  very sincerely  holds within him  the notion  that people  with a different  view might  actually have  a point  and I think  there's a  I don't think  it's a political  posture with him  I think  having known him  a little bit  I think he's  a guy with  a  it's really  interesting to me  that conservatives  want to like 
[02:56:30]  slap the radical  label on him  because he  he's actually  if there was ever  a quote unquote  liberal that  conservatives  should be  comfortable with  he's the one  because he is  a very measured  guy  I don't think  I've heard  him say  you know  you shouldn't  go into politics  if you think  you're the revolution  and I think  his  I think  as a listener  and as a  person who  genuinely takes  in the notion  that the  opposing side  might have a  point  he's  someone I 
[02:57:00]  think  he's a real  model to me  of kind of  listening with  respect to the  other side  of the conversation  so you're  saying that  just from what  you know  about him  he's not  a knee-jerk  reactionary  guy  he will  actually weigh  options  as opposed  to a lot  of politics  I think  it's very  interesting to me  to hear conservatives  talk about him  as though he's  a radical  he's a much  much more  measured  I think  politician  than what  we've had  I mean  radicalism  is what's  gone on  for the last  eight years  that's radical  that's 
[02:57:30]  ideological  radicalism  do you think  he's going  to win  what's that  think he's  going to win  I do actually  based on  what  based on  the fact  that I  think  that  you know  you can  you can  only  you can  only sucker  people the  same way  for so long  you know  what I mean  and Americans  we may be  we may be  complacent  because we're  comfortable  and that  makes people  lazy and  complacent  and  and  and kind 
[02:58:00]  of more  inclined  to  to just  kind of  go along  with what's  been going  on  but  but on the  other hand  Americans  I think  get very  I think  Americans  we may be  slow to  kind of  perceive  you know  the way  we're getting  hoodwinked  and bamboozled  but once  we do  I think  Americans  have a real  righteous  kind of  anger  at being  suckered  and I  think  and I  think  that the  I think  that the  you know  I think  that the  emperor's  clothes  is off  this particular 
[02:58:30]  set of  lies  that we've  been being  fed  for a while  and I  think  I don't  think  he's  going to  win  by a  landslide  but  but I  think  that  I think  people  are  kind  of  recognizing  that  we're  not  that we're  not as  dynamic  as we  used to  be  and  I don't  think he's  going to  win  you don't  think so  based on  the fact  that there's  200 million  white people  in this  country  and I  don't  think  enough  are  going to  vote  for a  black  president  that's  that's  what I  that's  why  I don't  think  going to  win  and  again  that's  why  I  think  maybe  I'm 
[02:59:00]  just  maybe  I'm  outdated  I  think  that  you  need  a lot  of  white  people  to  walk  in  and  push  a  button  for  the  black  president  I  think  he's  got  that  though  I  don't  think  he  does  and  I  think  that  if  you're  in  Los  Angeles  or  if  you're  in  New  York  maybe  Chicago  and  I  don't  know  Alabama  with  a lot  of  they  took  Barack  over  Hillary  white  people  had  the  choice  and  they  took  Barack  over  Hillary  very  strongly 
[02:59:30]  but  this  is  based  on  the  fact  that  you  believe  in  this  system  and  again  some  shit  I  heard  that  bothered  me  that's  why  I'm  trying  not to  pay  attention  because  I  don't  want  to be  bothered  I  don't  want  to be  upset  is  the  fact  that  the  Bradley  effect  the  Bradley  effect  where  motherfuckers  lie  representing  the  entire  like  Nielsen  ratings  it's  one  goofy  family  in  Ohio 
[03:00:00]  representing  what  I  watch  I  think  that  there's  going  to  be  there's  a lot  of  interesting  things  at play  in this  election  I  think  that  there's  no  doubt  that  it's  going  to be  a real  referendum  on how  much  the  country  has  grown  up  or  not  I  mean  I  think  with  conditions  in  this  country  as  bad  as  they  are  if  those  kinds  of  prejudices  prevent  us  from  making  a  dynamic  change 
[03:00:30]  when  we  need  it  it's  going  to  say  a lot  about  who  we  actually  are  and  how  much  we  have  actually  grown  up  and I  think  it's  going  to be  really  interesting  to see  I  think  it's  going  to be  very  revealing  it's  pretty  wild  it's  going  to  say  a  lot  whichever  way  it  goes  it's  going  to  say  a  lot  you  know 
[03:01:00]  Obama  you  hung  out  with  him  I  interacted  with  him  I  work  on  low  income  housing  issues  and  stuff  like  that  I  interacted  with  him  when  he  was  first  in  the  Senate  on  some  of  that  kind  of  work  and  I  was  really  very  sincerely  impressed  with  him  I  thought  he  was  a  very  unvarnished  kind of  guy  very  self  aware  so  you  knew  him  or  had  interacted  with  him  before  he  was  on  the  national  stage  very 
[03:01:30]  very  much  so  I  thought  I  was  very  impressed  with  his  intelligence  with  the  measured  way  that  he  listened  and  he  seemed  to me  to be  a  very  good  manager  he  just  seems  to me  to be  a  guy  who  knows  very  well  effectively  how  to  use  the  skill 
[03:02:00]  sets  of  the  people  around  him  and  I  think  that's  a  huge  asset  for  someone  I  mean  people  keep  talking  about  experience  like  there  is  not  a  person  on  the  planet  who's  ready  for  that  job  that's  just  the  truth  of it  nobody  is  ready  for  that  job  it's  that  job  is  beyond  anybody's  experience  level  it's  I'm  much  more  interested  in  somebody  having  a  sense  of  the  times  that  we're  living  in  and  being  able  to  articulate  a 
[03:02:30]  vision  for  who  it  is  we're  aspiring  to  be  in  the  years  ahead  I think  most of  the best  presidents  have done  that  have understood  what the  country needed  at the  moment  that it  was  in  and  I  think  that  is  there  a  piece  of  you  I'm  just  trying  to  maybe  catch  up  to  maybe  where  people  are  is  there  anything  in  you  that  sees  a  black  guy  anything  that  you  go  wow  it  might 
[03:03:00]  be  a  black  president  or  is  it  all  colorless  I  mean  I  it  both  excites  me  for  that  reason  in  the  sense  that  I  think  to  me  I'm  not  I'm  not  immune  to  the  symbolism  of  wanting  someone  to  lead  us  who  I  think  actually  represents  the  diversity  of  who  we  are  but  at  the  same  time  it's  irrelevant  to me  completely  irrelevant  so  I mean  it's  weird  it's  schizophrenic 
[03:03:30]  on the  one  hand  I  think  the  fact  of  it  is  it  is  there  and  it's  historic  and  exciting  but  his  black  it  means  nothing  to  me  the  fact  that  he's  a  black  guy  right  yeah  okay  fair  enough  boy  you  are  a  good  actor  no  I  mean  from  watching  American  History X  wow  hey  the  curb  scene  took  55  takes  I  just  couldn't  do  it  can  you  CGI  my  foot  off  his  head 
[03:04:00]  hey  guys  I  gotta  jump  oh  damn  yeah  we  were  getting  a  message  there  but  we  didn't  even  talk  about  pride  and  glory  this  movie  I  call  you  back  how  long  are  you  on  oh  all  right  you  just  gotta  go  do  something  else  for  a  little  bit  yeah  we're  on  another  pride  and  glory  when  you  call  back  all  right  good  enough  that's  awesome  Edward Norton  everyone  the first half  of the interview  I don't  agree with his  politics or anything  I think he's a great  actor and  I expect that 
[03:04:30]  everything that  that's what I expect  but maybe it's the truth  though  but what's  my thing is  I'm not saying you're  wrong to respect it  but what's phony  about it  if that's Edward  to tell the truth  like he  he  he  he  about  like hey  you know  him being a black  guy is part of it  you know  where it's like  wow it's exciting  and stuff  but here's the thing  I think that  him calling  made me  is helping me out  is this  when you say  the same thing  he didn't  say  this is what I mean 
[03:05:00]  do you see black  what  and  and something  something  some something  something  something  some something  and something else  yeah I see that  motherfucker's black  yeah  that's all I'm  that's why I'd ask  but he did say that  in historic  don't forget  he's also a guy  that knew him  and he was  instead of harping  on words like  platitudes  like oh it's hopeful  and it's great  he was saying  yeah I think he's  a really good manager  he's a guy who manages  people around him well  he was a guy that was  actually giving you  tangible reasons 
[03:05:30]  why he likes Obama  instead of some phony  I think it's wonderful  what I want to hear  what I want to hear  is  the  just the words  that  look  fucking  you talk to me about  and just to let you know  there's not  you talk to me about  Robert Blake  Beretta  this is old school shit  but the reason I thought  Beretta never killed his wife  yeah  wrong right  he goes  I think he did  he goes  wait a minute  but here's what made me feel 
[03:06:00]  that way  and then  the reverse  on OJ  what made me finally  really believe he did it  one is  he wrote a book called  If I Killed the Bitch  if I killed the bitch  this is what I would have did  where I go  you fucking asshole  Robert Blake goes  my wife  I hated the bitch  I wish she was dead  the wish came true  that's it  is that an exact quote from him  but I didn't  I didn't do it  which I said  holy fuck 
[03:06:30]  if you're a liar  you can't even lie like that  no you'd be  I'm so devastated  that motherfucker said  thank god that bitch is dead  but I didn't kill her  a motherfucker to say that  that to me  seemed as honest  as you can get  but  I could be wrong  but I'm just talking about  just  is he  do you see that he's black  this is what I mean  either  either as a white person  this is the frustration  you gotta be  a fucking maniac  what a  what a  with a hood  or  you gotta be 
[03:07:00]  a person who  doesn't see color  but he did  he didn't  I know what you mean  but it's like a lot of times  you're expecting too much  out of people  on a phone interview  for them to just  come right out and go  okay yeah he's a black guy  and I feel this way  and that way  as opposed to  when you ask him a question  like do you like Obama  he's giving you a genuine answer  when you ask the racial question  he was saying that like  yeah I understand  in a historical context  it's great  but  I mean  it's not the main reason  I like him  and I think that was  a pretty genuine answer  it's almost like  I didn't say he was being  disingenuous  no no no  but 
[03:07:30]  do you see a black guy  Norton  what do you mean  when you see Obama  yeah I see the first black president  and you see a black guy  but not in the  I don't know how you mean that  in the sense  do I know he's black  yeah  but when I started to like him  was when I heard the answers  he gave Matt Lauer  and I heard some of the answers  because I didn't like him  well I want a black president  enough to go for a guy  I didn't like  just to see a black president  when he started giving like  really tangible answers  like oh yeah he is specific  like you heard that  oh he just talks  in all these platitudes  and whatever  and then I heard  fucking Palin doing that 
[03:08:00]  but what I heard him doing  I liked the answers he gave  when I heard him answer directly  so that's when I started to like  so did I see a black guy  like I see you as a black  of course I know you're a black guy  but I see Patrice  I don't see him as Obama  on that level  because I don't know him  or love him  but it's  but I asked him on a level  because I don't know him  right  I just asked him on a level  do you see a black guy  yeah I do  but it doesn't need a context  but that's the thing  about all of this  that is dangerous  for Ed Norton 
[03:08:30]  dangerous for Jim Norton  dangerous for anybody  is that the people  who for some reason  fucking assholes  are in charge of context  I see black guy first  that's what I see  when he was running  I'm like  oh black guy wants to run  and you don't give a fuck  because you've established  and this is  listen  this is the reason  here we go  Pee Wee Herman  and Michael Richards  don't have a career  right now  yep  is because of this  fucking blacks  I will  I will never 
[03:09:00]  take a job  for Disney  mmhmm  because I ultimately  know at some point  I'll jerk off  like  like  you're gonna jerk off  ultimately  I'll get caught  jerking off something  I'll get caught  doing something  un-Disney  mmhmm  I know me  right  so I need a job  where it doesn't matter  if I'm gonna jack off  at some point  and get caught  exactly  he said  he's a jack offer  who set himself up  to be a child 
[03:09:30]  man  yeah  yeah  one of these  Michael Richards  set himself up  to be  oh Jerry's  wacky neighbor  who in his heart  can just go  nah  and he  set himself up  to be a liar  mmhmm  and it's like  that's what I'm talking about  just  if you just say  what you are  for half a second  no one will be able  to stop you  these people won't be able  to throw things  in your face  what about this  what did you mean  remember that motherfucker  that said  he goes  he insinuated that  fighting dogs 
[03:10:00]  was as  as worse than rape  yeah yeah  and I had to  I had to sit there  and look in the air  and go  wait a minute  if I see a woman  getting raped on the left  and somebody choking  a kitten on the right  yeah  which do I jerk off to  both  I jerk off to both  see what I'm saying  I don't know  like ultimately  we're so ready  to be  pushed in the corner  of the  the ass  why do fucking  cornballs  get to run 
[03:10:30]  why  why do cornballs  get to fuck up  my ludicrous interview  I really want to  know that  I really want to  meet them  really want to know  them  but  cornballs  out there  the people  I don't know  the white people  that's not you  make motherfuckers  answer questions  like  zoobity zap  ze bop  doobity bow  like  I don't want the jazz answer  just say the shit  it's just be  yeah be honest  and just  give an answer 
[03:11:00]  I agree with you  100% on that one  it's like  idealistically of course  we would love that  from those guys  and there is a way  to say shit  and I'm not  talking about  zuba dabba  jazz saying shit  there is a way  to be completely  honest  and say it  so it doesn't  come off  nasty  or anything  it's just  honesty  it's like  this is me  this is how I feel  about certain things  this is how I get  at certain times  this is what  whatever the fuck  there's a way  to say it  where it doesn't  sound like  you're an extremist  or a nut 
[03:11:30]  but it's just you  be fucking honest  about it  just be you  that's it  just be you  but you're right  there's so many people  just want to dance  around shit  and not give  a right answer  you know  that answer  do you see  you know  black  and they're like  no I wasn't even  he's black  you heard it  it's ridiculous  you heard it  I wasn't trying  to muscle him  I'm just saying  do you see black  and he never said  black  he did fess up 
[03:12:00]  to it  when he said  yes  him being black  and being the president  did excite him  that was something  that he did want to see  he did say that  yes  you know  but then  do you see  do you see color  do you see color  that was kind of  a scooby dabby  dooby doo  but you may get  the jazz answer  I love the jazz answer  I'm just gonna say that  now when people  ask me shit  that's a tough question  for somebody  who doesn't know  who's asking 
[03:12:30]  what the context  of the whole day  on the phone  all of a sudden  do you see black  yeah  but what do you mean  we could have been  talking about  how only racists  see black first  the whole morning  he doesn't fucking know  that  all of a sudden  you're saying  this guy  do you see black  he knows Obama  fair enough  yeah but  a lot of times  context doesn't matter  fair enough  why don't we take a break  lady  I'm gonna have you  fix Norton's mic  oh dude  I'm sorry  this is  do it  just keep doing

[03:21:30]  This sounds like the beginning of Blade Runner.  It's not him, though.  Oh, is it?  Yeah, it's not me.  The audience.  Sent in covers of his song.  Yeah.  We're trying to get a verse.  That's right. 
[03:22:00]  This song would have opened for Devo.  Yeah, exactly.  I want to do a popper and suck in his dick. 
[03:22:30]  He's singing into a fan.  Wow, there you go.  What I've learned from this contest so far is that a lot of our listeners are very musically  talented, but they have no voice.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They can't sing, and then they try to process it, and it just makes it even worse.  It makes it worse.  Well, Brother Joe did a version.  Brother Joe had to do his own version.  Yeah, it's obviously done in the style of James Taylor. 
[03:23:00]  Pendulum.  Brother Joe's version.  It's a sweet version.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you know we'll swing at the center of attention  Just another day, another condescension 
[03:23:30]  Mock you, shock you, gonna lock you down  And you know we'll shift with a little bit of pressure  Go too slow, and the pendulum will get you  Show you, mow you  Gonna throw you around  Yeah  You did the crime but not the time  Now you gotta pay for what you've done, you better run 
[03:24:00]  Had all I can take, all you're screaming in my ear  My back is gonna break if you push me one more time  My blood's getting heavy, my blood's getting cold  You change me into something that I can't control  If you see me coming, let's get out of my way  Then your lumb is swinging back the other way 
[03:24:30]  Swinging back the other way  The pendulum can take only so much yelling  What he'll do next, well there's no telling  Bump you, shock you, gonna dump you out  The pendulum will break under too much tension 
[03:25:00]  Breaking down the walls of my detention  Wrecking, falling, kingdom falling down  Down, down, done the crime but not the time  Now you gotta pay for what you've done, you better run  I've had all I can take, all you're screaming in my ear  My back is gonna break if you push me one more time 
[03:25:30]  I, I, I, I, I, I  It's getting heavy  Wow  Freaking Joe  Yeah, that's a classic old fucker  Blood's getting cold  It's so sweet  I hope Joe makes it into a hit and then sues Steve  Wait, why?  I don't know  Because it'd be fun  Yeah, no reason  How about one more?  See you raked over the coals in the legal system for no reason  Yeah  One more taste  What is this, JV2? 
[03:26:00]  I think it's J7  J7 he goes with?  Okay, J7, he did this version of pendulum  One more before we take a break  Because I think Ed Norton's gonna call back  I think it's J7, he's gonna call back 
[03:26:30]  It's J7, he's gonna call back  Would you fuck me? 
[03:27:00]  I would fuck me  This is music to fuck another man in the ass to  What music is this?  I like it 
[03:27:30]  Sweaty dance club  A bunch of gay men  Nice  Nice  Wow  You're getting a lot of answers  Wow that was some techno huh?  Sure is  Damn 
[03:28:00]  One more or no  I was raving  I mean if you want to talk to Norton  He's calling back in like five minutes  Let's take a break  We'll talk to Edward  We'll come back and then we'll play more  Edward Norton after the break  Stay there  Great song  It's a great great song  It was done by a character  How you ain't gonna fuck?  Bitch I'm me  I love this song actually  It's a little guilty pleasure  I like some of these rap songs  We're back  We got Edward Norton on the phone 
[03:28:30]  Calling back  He's a man of his word  We like that  Cause sometimes people go  I'll call you back  And next thing you know  They're off doing their thing  Edward  Hey  So why don't we talk about the movie  There's a nice buzz about this movie  Pride and Glory  It's a good one yeah  I'll vouch for this one  Good one  See they play their role  We play ours  We had openly admitted  Some of the movies that we pushed  Just cause we liked the guy  And you know 
[03:29:00]  I don't know  Like yeah maybe it wasn't so good  But  Yeah you know  What we do is  We're lucky enough to get screeners  And I swear  No one offered me a screener  Of Pride and Glory  I have no idea  So what I'm about to say  Might be a little weird  But  We'll get the buzz ahead of time  And we'll purposely not see a movie  So we could have integrity  When we talk to some of you guys  I haven't seen it  Yeah  But we know damn well  That it's probably not gonna be a good one  But we're hearing that 
[03:29:30]  This is really gonna be a good movie  This Pride and Glory  I don't know  It reminds me of like  The guy who directed it  He just  He really  I don't know  He had  Like the deer hunter  You know the way the deer hunter  Really feels like  Like about working class  People  And it feels like  He just achieved this really  I don't know  Really strong authenticity  And if you're a New Yorker  It's like  It's cool  It's a real  In the street  Kind of badass  Yeah for the people that don't know 
[03:30:00]  The movie's about what  It's  It's about a family of cops  In New York  And  And the one  You know one of them  Kind of  Realizing that  Some of his family  Is tied up in some  Some shit they shouldn't be  In  And kind of  Having to figure out  What the hell  You know what he's gonna do  But it's  It's a very hard hitting film  There's a bit  You know you guys were making the joke  About the curbing scene  In American History X  Oh yeah 
[03:30:30]  There's a  There's a scene  In this movie  I'm not  It was Colin Farrell  In it  That  Since  Since  I remember standing  In the back of the audience  Watching that  That scene in American History X  Watching the way audiences  Would pretzel up  You know when that happens  Pretzel up  And there's a scene  In this movie  That does that harder  Than anything I've seen  In a while  Really  Yeah it's a  It's one of the most  Like the audience  At the film festival  We first just went  Just went into  The fetus position  Like it was amazing 
[03:31:00]  To watch  Is it  Let me ask you a question  As an actor  Because you're like  You're a nice dude  You're not a brutal guy  Even though you are acting  Are there any scenes  You've had to do  In all these years  That were just hard to do  Like they said  When they  Like an example  They did Amistad  They said it was like  Really shaming black people  They said it was really  Like a weird experience  And painful for a lot of the actors  And it went beyond  Just hey we're actors  Doing this  Like it was hard  Is there anything  You've had to do  Or been asked to do  Like even though you know  You're acting  It was kind of difficult  You know sometimes 
[03:31:30]  It's not the things  You would think  I mean stuff like  Stuff  You know violence  Is done so technically  You know it takes  So many angles  And you have to do things  With such kind of  Choreography and precision  That it sort of  Takes the emotion  Out of it  But I think  I think sometimes  It's  You know it's  I mean I guess  You know I've never  Had to do anything  With like  Treating a kid  Really badly  Or something  I mean I think  That would be tough  But  But 
[03:32:00]  But I don't know  You gotta  You kinda gotta  Believe in the  Big picture on a thing  If you  Like American history  Actually  If you  If you don't  If you don't believe  In what the movie's about  Then  Then you're in trouble  Because you're gonna  Have to do  You know  A bunch of stuff  In it that  You're going  Why are we doing this  You know  I was thinking  That movie in particular  With the  The scene you do  With Elliot Gould  Is pretty brutal  Right  Yeah  See now that  I mean that's an example  But  But what's interesting 
[03:32:30]  In that is like  What  What makes that good  Is  Like Elliot  You know  We worked a while  We worked on the lines  Together  You kinda craft  A scene  And then you're really  You're really  Doing it together  And  And  And so you've  Kind of all been  Going over  And looking at it  And going  Is this  You know  When you work on it  With somebody  It kinda takes the  Yeah it takes the edge off  It is amazing  When you watch it  Cause as a viewer  You're just watching it  For the first time  You see it  And you just go  Holy shit  That is brutal 
[03:33:00]  Yeah  That is brutal  I think  I think that  You know  There's  This movie  Pride and Glory  Has some  Pride and Glory  Has some really  Really hard hitting stuff  In it  I think it's  It's  It reminds  It reminded me  When I read it  Of like Serpico  You know  Like some of the  Really good  Lumet films  In the 70s  Of really  Kinda gritty  Gritty  Street life  Of cops  And  Does it take place  In  The cops who have seen it  Have been really  Really into it 
[03:33:30]  Does it take place  In you know  Today  Or is it  Yeah  And it's all  Shot up in  Washington Heights  And it's  Yeah  I think it  I mean  Not to put too  Political  A thing on  We were talking  Politics  It's  It's kind of  I kind of  Think it's about  Things that the  Country's been going  Through  Like institutional  Lying  And you know  What do you  Like I was thinking  When I was reading  The script  I was thinking  About Abu  Grieve  And  Like the way  That you know  There was some  Soldier  Some soldier  Somewhere  Who was like 
[03:34:00]  Really loyal to his  To his  You know  To his  Comrades  And to his  Army  And to the  Country  And all these  Things  Somebody said  I'm going to  Mail these pictures  Because this is not  What we signed up for  And I was reading  The script  And going  This is  This is kind of  About that  Like how do you  Make  How do you decide  When it's that  Moment where you're  Going to kind of  Blow the whistle  On an institution  That you're  Loyal to  You know what I  Mean  When do you  When do you  Start holding  You know 
[03:34:30]  The institution  Accountable  Well you  Not to interrupt you  But you play a cop  Who's  You're kind of  Investigating a case  That it  Reveals an incendiary  Police corruption  Scandal  And it involves  Colin Farrell  Who plays your  Brother-in-law  So he's kind of  A guy that's in  Some kind of  Trouble  And you're  Investigating something  That uncovers him  Yeah  Exactly  Colin's amazing  And he's  It's a really  Down in the shoes  Performance for him  Does he have to  Do the whole thing  Without the accent  Huh  Yeah  You know 
[03:35:00]  It's great  He sounds like  He's  That's  That's  We were so  God damn hard  I don't know  How they do it  I don't know  I could do it  For a few  Like seconds  Or a few  Words  Or a line  Or a sentence  And then  It's just me  Yeah  We have a good  Brawl in it  Colin and I  Have a fight  In the end  That's  It was up there  With the  It's tough  Who do you think  Would really  Kick ass  In that one  If you had to  Fight him  Colin's  Colin's  You know  Like compact  And tough  But I've got  Reach on him 
[03:35:30]  You know  Yeah  I think I could  Like do the thing  Where you hold him  By the forehead  And you know  Keep him swinging  At air  And then just  So what's your  Build in this one  American history  X  Or fight club  Build  What's that  Oh  You know  Cops  Winter  Chunky  Oh okay  They're thick  You know  A little  Thick  Yeah  More towards  Fight club  Show me a skinny  New York cop  Right  True  Edward Norton 
[03:36:00]  And friend  Jim Norton  I mean  There's something  About the ring  Of that  Which I think  A lot of people  A big buzz  Would be created  Would it  Should be a buddy film  Yeah  The Nortons  What if it just said  Norton  Norton  Absolutely  Edward and Chip  Like both our names  Over it  Kind of the way  De Niro and Pacino  Have their names  Above  The movie  We could have done  Like stepbrothers  Yeah  That is the big thing  To do on the ads  We were  I don't know why  We were doing this film  Down in Louisiana  And there's  Some character actor  Whose last name 
[03:36:30]  Is Cheeseman  Going to be in the movie  And we started laughing  Thinking like  You know  What if you were  Like this really  Like serious  Dramatic actor  And your last name  Was Cheeseman  And it was like  You know  Brando  De Niro  Cheeseman  Cheeseman  It would be really hard  It would be really hard  Some of them  Don't fit on the billboard  Very well  They don't look  Very good on a billboard  Cheeseman  Mastering commander  You know what I mean  Cheeseman  What if it was like  Jim Norton  Ed Cheeseman 
[03:37:00]  It's pretty bad  You know  You worked with  Our own Patrice O'Neill  That we have  Sitting here right now  Do you remember  Guys from like  Small scenes  You've done  Or guys that only  Had like a one scene  A lot of times  Do you remember  Yeah  It was in  25th hour  Patrice you played  Big black door guy  Yeah he's a big  Black door guy  Yeah at the club  At the club scene  Yeah that's Patrice  Patrice  Knock it off  Was Patrice  Was Patrice a good actor  Who's difficult to work with 
[03:37:30]  Because he said  That you're an intimidating  Guy to work with  You know  Well Spike  Spike kind of casts well  So  Must have been  Something he saw  That's a backhanded  Compliment  I like that  Hey Spike  Like some fucking  I got paid  I got to say  A few words  In front of him  Screw it  Patrice  Tony Siragusa  Was in that movie  You remember him  The Baltimore Ravens  Linebacker  Oh really  He played the big  Russian muscle guy  Yeah  Oh yeah okay  Oh wow yeah 
[03:38:00]  He was big  No no  I do remember  He was big  No I haven't seen  The movie  But I remember  No  I did see that one  I think I've seen  All your movies  Jesus Christ  I've not seen  25th hour  That's a good one  Hey Edward  Your version of  The Incredible Hulk  Is out  Coming out on DVD  Is it  I'll see your  Okay  Well then  We got the  Well it says  His version  So I was wondering  If you finally  Made good with that  Whole Hulk experience  No no  Okay  I don't know what that  That's a  Wow that's a bad typo 
[03:38:30]  Then  I didn't even  I thought you guys  Made nice  Cause I  You know  It's  It was  Was it coming out  It was well documented  That you were not  Not happy with the  Whole Hulk movie  No no  I just  Wasn't  You know  It was more like  Marvel  Those guys  The director  And I were great  He was great  Yeah  You like  I like the fact  That if you don't  Like a project  You're obviously  Not going to go out  And promote it  But like a lot of guys  Like you see  De Niro and Pacino  Just did  Righteous Kill  And you know  We all know  De Niro and Pacino  Are you know 
[03:39:00]  I mean  They are who they are  And it wasn't a great film  And I'm sure  That they knew that  I mean  They're not dummies  I mean  They've both done  Enough brilliant work  Where they know  When something is like  A paycheck  What's going through  Someone's mind  Or as an actor  When you've got to go out  And promote something  That you know  Is kind of like  Not your best  Or the film itself  Is there a frustration  With that  I mean  At times  I'm sure  Contractually  They're obligated  I haven't had that  Experience really  Too much  I mean  I  You know  I really  I pretty much  Try not to work  On stuff  Unless  Unless  I think there's 
[03:39:30]  Something in it  That's going to  Interest me  You know  To talk about  And  You know  I've  I've had my  Differences  With  On some  But  But I guess  You know  One thing is  I think one thing  Is you've got to  Keep perspective  I mean  Movies are movies  You know  It's not  We're not running  For president  We're not  You know  Yeah  I think  I think it's nice  I mean  I try to keep  An integrity  If I  I'm not going to 
[03:40:00]  Go and sit  And say a bunch  Of crap  About something  That I don't feel  Right  And I definitely  Will say to people  If like  You know  If  Don't put me  In a  You probably  Don't want me  Out there  In a situation  Where I'm going  To duck and dive  Around a question  Because I'm not  Going to fake it  Yeah  But  And so  In a lot of ways  I'll leave it up to them  You know  I mean  I'm a professional  And I'll do my  Do my bit  But  You know  The only problem  To me  Is if people  Expect you to say  Something that you're 
[03:40:30]  Not feeling  In particular  I think that's  Always your right  To kind of  Say  How about the Jets  This year  We  We may have asked you  The first time  You called  I don't remember  But I know  That there was  A big thing  I think it was  Tony Kaye  Who directed  American History X  Was really unhappy  With the final thing  Do you know  What it was  That he wanted  To happen  That they didn't  Let happen  Or what did he  Want to do  That they didn't  That was all  Kind of a tempest  In a teapot  He got into  Tony was an  Interesting cat  He  He  He kind of 
[03:41:00]  I just think  Had what I would  Call like  Completion anxiety  You know  Some people  Never want to  Let it go  And let it  Be out there  He didn't  Ultimately have  He didn't  Ultimately have  Like  He didn't  Ultimately have  Really  Specific  Differences  With them  I think he  Just literally  Never wanted  To keep  Working forever  And  But I  You know  I know  We have  You know  Mutual acquaintances  And he  I know  He  I know  He is  Very proud  Of the film  Completion anxiety  Is actually a good  Way to put it 
[03:41:30]  When you look at  Like  Chinese democracy  Axel Rose  Doing Chinese  Democracy  It's like  Sometimes I think  People are afraid  Just to kind of  Let the work be done  And just kind of  Put it out as it is  They kind of  Become affectionate  About it  Well then also  It gets judged  You get to a point  Where you realize  Like with these things  That you never  At a certain point  You let them go  Because you're too  You're too close on them  And you never really know  How they're going to break  Across other people  And  You gotta  You gotta get out of the way  You know  You just gotta let it  Yeah  Let it 
[03:42:00]  Let it be what it is  But  Are you gonna be  On Entourage  Or what  Nah  You know  They're talking about  You a lot  On this  Second hand  From everybody  Yeah  A lot of people  Thinking you're gonna  Make an appearance  On Entourage  Is there a payday for me  In it  Huh  You know  Is this a big payday  Can I get a like  You know  A huge  Like fee  For a brief guest spot  Yeah  A quick little cameo  Yeah  Hey Jim  Are you still doing  The cellar  I am  Yeah  I'm there  I'm there  Sporadically  Throughout the week

[03:43:30]  I think  I think  Your audience  Will like that movie  It's a good one for them  Alright  It feels like  A thin fall too  I don't really  You know  I mean  I'm trying to figure out  What I'm really stoked to see  I can't really  Yeah  There's not really much  You should  Come in and see us  One of these days  Yeah  That'd be fun  Edward  Edward Norton  Alright  We should let him go  Yes  He's a very busy man  Pride and Glory  In theaters October 24th  Nine days from now  Thank you Edward  Thanks for the time  Bye  Good luck man  There he goes  Edward Norton  Maybe one of these days 
[03:44:00]  We'll actually get him  In the studio  Well you know  Wouldn't that be something  I mean it really seems like  We do have good phone conversations  With this gentleman  He's a good phone  You know  He's conversational  He doesn't back off  I like him in rounders too  I didn't see that either  Oh fuck  You gotta see that  He's really good  Plays a really good douche  In that one  You know  I will actually probably see that  Before I see him at the cellar  Because I want to  Probably talk about that  When he comes  Oh god  He asks about  If he's gonna be at the cellar

[03:45:00]  No you didn't  He means me  I had a party  None of you were invited  It was called  A blanket party  It was me  And a few marines  And Roland  We beat him with soap  Ow  Ow  No but I did though  You did  Yeah he did  I was very bothered  I was like  Roland why don't you bring me  He would have been  So surprised and happy  To see me  Were you just sitting  In the corner by yourself  Or were people talking to you  No people talked to me  The whole Judd Apatow crew  He threw a party  What did you sweat on  What kind of furniture  Does he have  He has a Bruce Springsteen  Memorabilia  Oh he does  He told me  Don't steal it 
[03:45:30]  You had a  Oh you  Walking out of his house  With some shit  My dad has a guitar  Bruce  Really  Does he  What were you telling me  On the way home the other day  Elvis Presley autograph  Guitar  Oh my dad has a  He's got an  Elvis Presley autographed guitar  In his family  Yeah but it's bullshit  Because it's on a 1985 calendar  They think that Roland  I expected more of that  Quick improv calendar  He said it was a guitar  Roland snored  He did  Because we already  Established that it was a guitar  But it was a signed guitar  And you said a calendar 
[03:46:00]  Yeah  Oh  Not even an answer  Just oh  Alright  What am I going to say  Literal open answer  Sorry  Jim the joke didn't work  Because it was established  It had already been  Pre-established  We established the fact  That it was a guitar  That's all  You're right  Fucking Rangers  Go  Go screw Roland  I know  Yeah I know  Yeah  But your prospect  Dies of a heart attack  So there you go 
[03:46:30]  Yeah one down  Why do you think  They're so good this year  I mean are they  Going to remain good all year  Or is this kind of like  Something that's just  Kind of starting  Young players  Fun of the day  Is brought to you by  Webex.com  Hold meetings  Make presentations  Do it from the comfort  Of your own home  Or office  Check it out at  Webex.com  Let's get right into  The runner ups  A runner up line of the day  I'm already making sacrifices  I just don't want to make  More sacrifices  By pressing that button  It says negro  It's not pressing  The negro button

[03:47:30]  You alright  It's fine  Catch a rising star  Yeah  Providence Rhode Island  This weekend  I told you  About Edward Norton  What would happen  If you said  I was in a movie with him  But you didn't talk to him  So he probably  If you would have said  Yeah remember that scene  We did  He might have relayed  Of course he would have  But we got the real honesty  Which was  Yeah Spike made the choice  If Spike made the choice  I'm sure he was good  I don't remember him  From a hole in the wall  Because you weren't  Connecting him to anything  Like  I know what you're saying  But if you would have said  To him hey  What about  This scene we did  He might have talked to you 
[03:48:00]  And go yeah you were good  Or whatever  He just  You just won more guys  I wasn't good  That's why I didn't say anything  Oh  Because he said  Listen you tried it  That way ten times  Why don't you try it  I swear  Did he really say that  Yeah but  Oh shit  But Spike told me  That I did something different  And Spike said  What the fuck you doing  He said but  I said uh  I said I'm the director  Oh shit  That's true  I'm sorry  I'm sorry I brought it up  Then Patrice  No it doesn't matter  I'll tell you  I just wanted to see  I was curious to see  If he remembered you or not

[03:50:30]  Where you go  He had just came out  I think with 40  What was that movie  51 or something  Yeah the baseball  The baseball movie  61  51 was no good  Because that was still nice  10 short of the record  And so  He does that  He does that  But I just go  I just fuck with him  And I go  Hey man  I loved you in Battlefield Earth  Thought that was the best  Oh shit  And  You touched it  The reality of a motherfucker  By saying  What evidently  Is the worst movie ever made 
[03:51:00]  Of all time  And if he had to went  Thank you  Thank you  Then I don't know  This guy's a dick  Yeah  But he looked at me  Like I'll fuck you up  You say some shit  Like he really was like  And I go  Good man  Good fucking man  And he just goes  That movie  And he just started  Yapping about shit  Yeah  And it was hilarious dude  Oh that's cool  He was Roger Maris  Yeah  And then he  Then he asked Patrice  A question  Because he thought  He was a lighting guy  He had no idea  He was actually a guy  Who would go on the radio  And say it  Nah but 
[03:51:30]  But it's  But I didn't say  That's what I'm saying  I'm not betraying  What he fucking said  Nah no  In the first time  You know  I don't want to  But fucking  But I knew he would  Because I only saw  Ed Norton  During the scene  He would  After he said cut  He would walk away  And go back into  What he was doing  Yeah  And it was weird  Because it was all  Like  Those type of actors  They were all  Not  Actual  After cut  It was done  So it was like  Anna Paquin  And  Rosario Dawson  But not everyone wants to yap  Like you do  It's not a yap 
[03:52:00]  Oh shit  Oh fuck it  Wait what do you  Is it a method actor thing though  I don't know  It's not even  It's just  Oh dick cheney's going to hospital  Oh shit  That's what I said  Oh no  That's news about  Yeah  Yeah  Fuck it  Now he's no big deal  So uh  How are Hoffman  Were you going to see  No they were all  You know they were all  Um  Actors  Meg Ryan  Any movie I've been in  Was just with actors  Like they do their thing  Meg Ryan's the same thing 
[03:52:30]  Yeah just  What's she being like that for  If I do like  14 takes  It was never  Hey what's  What's  Hi  Really  No  Nope  Alright now I'm into this  It's not even  It's not a fucking  Acknowledgement that you're  A human being  Alright  I apologize about the  It's not just a  Hey how's the weather  Cause I'm not that guy  I'm an aloof asshole  So it was just  The connection thing  There was no connection  Like hard to connect with them  Off the camera  Yeah it was just  It was just absolutely  Nothing  You would think they would  Actually talk a little bit 
[03:53:00]  About something  I got it now  Alright I'm sorry  And cut  Nice shoes  Nothing  It's like uh  Watching extras  You know  With your face  What happens is  When you're doing  Especially when you're doing  A series  Oh yeah  You a lot of times  We'll just do it  And then go back  To your trailer  For a little while  Do it time  Back to your training  Trailer  Training was something  I apparently have never had  If you've seen my work  Sure I have  Open mouth  Money up front  Stan Oslovsky  He's the name of that  Fucking transvestite  He sucks  Mr. Oslovsky 
[03:53:30]  Hey Stan  Why am I helping him  With this  I'm chipping in  On my own faggot joke  Well yeah  I mean it wasn't bad  I just knew  He just didn't cut  The only thing he had to say  Was try it another way  And I did  Did he say  Was he trying to help you  Or was he just not liking it  Of course he didn't say  Hey you fat non-actor  No but was he trying to help you  Or did he not like it  You think like  No he didn't like it  Where was fucking Spike  To just say  Spike is the one way of directing  And then  Why weren't he directing that 
[03:54:00]  And then his one  I was  So basically  I was doing okay at the time  Cause  Spike didn't say nothing  As soon as I  Did it his way  Spike goes  What was that  Were you changing  Cause I would laugh at  I would laugh  Spike liked I was laughing at him  For doing seven years  For whatever reason  Spike thought my character  Should be like  Damn that's fucked up  Cause that's how niggas would be  Yeah yeah  Like damn  Nigga you can't do seven years  But in  In white method world  It'd be like  You should be more concerning 
[03:54:30]  Cause a white guy would go  Dude  But a black guy would go  God damn  Nigga  Cause that's our way  Of loving you  It's like  Yeah yeah  Nigga you got age  God damn  Nigga that's fucked up  Let's go out and chill  You know  Yeah  But I was doing it  Just like that  Like god damn  You wanted like  Oh man  Like oh  Sugar beats  Oh  Seven years  Oh  So how'd you do it  For what Edward's take  I cared  Like you were like  Oh seven years man  Yeah  And Spike was like  What happened to the laugh  I go 
[03:55:00]  Boop boop boop  What made it in the movie  Which version  I've never seen the movie  I forgot  I don't know  You didn't see it  Who are you  Fucking Spencer Tracy  You don't want your own work  Nope  What's the matter with you  I don't  Jesus Christ  Guess who ate all the dinner  Holy shit  That's fucking fun  Let's do another runner up  Line of the day  WebEx.com  Here's another runner up  We're only five minutes  Into the first period  And this is  Willie O'Ree's  Fifth fight  And he hasn't even 
[03:55:30]  Gotten off his own bench yet  Stupid Willie O'Ree  First black hockey player  Pudge him  Pudge him  Pumpsy  Pumpsy  Pumpsy green  Pumpsy green  Pumpsy  Give me a Pumpsy  The fuck is this  Rolling  Go Sabres  Motherfucker  Go Sabres  Hey can I get a copy of him  Go Sabres  Motherfucker  Thank you  Pride and joy  I wanted to talk about 
[03:56:00]  That Marvel thing  But that wouldn't have  Like Marvel is  The fact that he said that  It means Marvel is coming out  They're assholes  Yeah  Marvel comics  That's they  You know they're like  John Favreau  Not gonna get his money  And it's really  Anytime a successful movie  Comes out  The sequel  Motherfuckers get double  What they made before  And they fucking  With Favreau about that  And Terrence Howard  Wanted his money  And Marvel's like  Motherfucker  The characters are  The star 
[03:56:30]  Yeah  Not you  Go fuck yourself  Who Terrence Howard play  I didn't see the first one  He plays War Machine  What's War Machine  It's Iron Man's  Sidekick  Is he critical  In the movie  War Machine  If you're a comic fan  War Machine and Iron Man  Is like  Robin  Here's why they said that  About Terrence Howard  Because they replaced  Batman 50 times  It is the character  They also replaced  The Joker  Look at what happens  You know what though  X-Men  Look at what happens  Look at the Batman movies  And what happened to them  Once they start going into 
[03:57:00]  Yeah  Changing  Yeah but I didn't like  You can't change like  Wolverine though  I didn't like Terrence Howard  In Iron Man  No  Okay  I was thinking about it  How was I with you  You know  It was unbelievable  You a fan of  I love Cheeto  And everything he does  I love both of those guys  I'm a fan of Terrence Howard  But I don't know  He kind of took me  Out of the movie  A little bit  But do you know  The character of War Machine  Hell no  It doesn't matter  Right  I feel you  Hell no  I mean  I love the movie by the way 
[03:57:30]  But you know  But I can see why  They might want to replace him  I wish  They didn't replace him  Because he sucked  They replaced him  Because he wanted some money  Yeah  I wish Ludacris  Would want to talk more  About Crash  I want to talk about  Terrence Howard  He had nothing to do with Crash  How he should have fucking  Ludacris was barely in Crash  How uh  He was actually really  He had a great moment  He had a very important  He had a few  Very important scenes  There was so many fucking  Matt Dillon  Should not have been nominated  For that  As much as I like him  Should have been Terrence Howard  Should have been the supporting actor 
[03:58:00]  Matt Dillon was  Fucking great  He really was  But I thought the deeper role  Was fucking Terrence Howard  Playing that guy  Tortured by Hollywood  And breaking down  And fucking  Fighting the breakdown  For so long  Crash  Not as predictable  Crash was amazing  I'll argue  What?  I'll argue Crash  With anybody  Fucking  I rate you  Stupid role in his  God damn  Rangers  And then he pulls her  Out of the car  I rate you  Man I save you  But that was a statement 
[03:58:30]  No that wasn't about him and her  That was kind of a statement  About the duality  Statement of  Of the way you look at cops  Where yeah  Because Hollywood always paints  The racist white cop asshole  But in this case  They show you like  Alright there are this side of them  But then again  These are guys  That fucking  Will crawl into a burning car  To pull you out  It wasn't about  The symbolism of him saving her  Was not him saving her  It was just about  The duality of everybody  Everybody got  Was painted stereotypically  And everybody was given redemption  Everybody  I love the fact that 
[03:59:00]  They show him being a fucking scumbag  Because that's how you expect him  To paint a white cop  And then you see the  Side of him holding his father  And you're like  Oh yeah there is another side  That you don't fucking  Just like with Ludacris  And the other dude  Yeah  I mean the other dude  Is a fucking  They're robbing somebody  And then all of a sudden  He's got this St. Christopher medal  And you see that  There's a fucking gentleness to him  There's redemption for every guy  Don Cheadle  A motherfucker  But that's why The Wire is good  That's why The Wire is a great show  Because there is no  You know when you pitch a show 
[03:59:30]  In a room  And you go  Hey listen  I'm gonna play a motherfucker  That just says fuck you  Right  So where's the  They call it this  The comeuppance  Where's the comeuppance  It's like  What comeuppance  Where does the character  For being what he is  End up suffering  That's what I'm saying  There is no  The Wire would write  A death  For a motherfucker  Who was really  Really not supposed to die  In Hollywood land  And I don't  I don't give a shit 
[04:00:00]  About redemption  No no no  But I'm saying  This is not  But it wasn't a politically  Correct redemption  It was  They were just showing  The fact that they showed  The white cop  Being a fucking  A scumbag  Is how you expect it  They showed things  You didn't expect  Them to show  Like the little girl  When she was about to get shot  I was absolutely convinced  She was going to get shot  Yeah  Because that's the big  Emotional scene  But they did it  A different way  When Ludacris  And the other guy  Robbed fucking them  They showed you  You know what  She's not some paranoid  White suburban bitch 
[04:00:30]  Who's just scared of blackness  You know what  There was a right reason  For her to make that judgment  You know where  Okay I'll go with  Here's where  Only thing I'll go with  Is this  Like I'll go  I'll go with you  On everything except for  It would have been cool  If Matt Dillon  Had a finger popped  What's her name  Yeah  Like he did  And then  Another white cop  Saved her  Like instead of him  It wasn't about  Saving the same bitch  That he finger ate  It wasn't about  Her though and him  I think that you had  Do you understand what I'm saying  I'm with you 
[04:01:00]  100% except for  The little girl  Like  Ludacris and Lorenz Tate  Didn't have to rob  Her  The girl  Who was like  Fuck black  Like have another  Arbitrary black person  Do it  And then  Have them rob  Somebody who's not  Fucking her  And instead of  Right right  All these weird  Six degrees  Don't forget  Bug me  Don't forget  I mean when you look  At The Wire  Which is my favorite show ever  You have five seasons  Of development  When you look at a movie 
[04:01:30]  You have an hour  And 45 minutes  To get your point across  Which is  When you look at a guy  Like Matt Dillon  They didn't want to give  Redemption to all cops  They were just showing you  An individual  Almost like  A little piece  And it wasn't necessarily  If he would have rescued  Another black woman  In a fire  You would have been like  Who gives a fuck  But this was to kind of  Make the point a little bit clearer  I didn't take it as literally  As that  They were showing you like  Yeah this guy was a scumbag  And he caused this rift  And then they showed you  This fucking turmoil  That these fucking two people  Have to go through  In their marriage 
[04:02:00]  Because of the shit he did  That it's not just  Hey they go home  And don't care about it  You know what I mean  They almost destroyed  The fucking marriage  I love the fact  They showed what Hollywood  Does to black directors  Isn't he supposed to be  The smart one  Like  When Terrence Howard  Was fucking fighting  To hold on to this  Thing and this  You know what I mean  It was like  They really got in deep  I thought  But you had to  Juxtapose these people together  For that to make sense  I mean that was just  Matt Dillon  You know what  You should have diddled her  When she was  Hanging by the fucking seatbelt  And you're loving it 
[04:02:30]  I would have shown  You love it  More than I hate it  So I'm  Oh  Like Norton  Norton  Loves it  His point is  Which by the way  Is why I'm  You know  Obama just cause he's black  Cause I don't want to be  Convist otherwise  Cause he might convince me  Otherwise  Like cause his  His thoughtfulness  Is way outweighing  My thoughtfulness  Of why I don't like it  I just don't  I just didn't like it  On just a fucking  Prehistoric level  Norton was like  Norton was like  An NYU film student  Yeah 
[04:03:00]  But I really  Studied it  So I  That movie really  Hit me  Like most movies don't  Because I so  You so know the formula  In all  You know what I mean  It's like  What did they show recently  Where they just  This is how they deal  With stereotypes  Is they just  Put a black guy  And a white guy  And switch them  With no thought  To it at all  Like oh look  The bad guy's white  The cop is black  It's like such a  Phony  Like I hate it  I hate it when they had  Michael Clark Duncan  As Kingpin  I'm a big comic book guy  And Kingpin is a big  Bad white dude  In the comics  And I don't want to see 
[04:03:30]  A black Kingpin  Just cause  Just because  Why  Like I don't want to see  Nothing black  That's like  You know  Here's negro  For ya  Like please don't  I want to see  White people  Where they supposed to be  Look how  Look how good we are  We actually  We know it's a white guy  It's supposed to be a white guy  We cast a black guy  In this  Another great  Great moment  Jaws will be played  By a stingray  That's fucking hilarious 
[04:04:00]  Fucking awful  Poor shit  That's right on man  Alright with that  Let's do  Another runner up  Another runner up  Line of the day  Slowly going through these  What did you say  It would look more realistic  If he just like  Wrote hair  On a piece of paper  And taped it to his head  That had me laughing  My ass off  That fucking wig  Was  Atrocious  I've seen burn victims  Look better in baseball caps 
[04:04:30]  Than that guy  That fucking wig  I wish we took a picture  Of that  Dude it was horrendous  We'll be back  I tried till my camera  Kept closing  I was embarrassed  When the shutter  Wouldn't open  Paul in Brooklyn  Was winking  Paulie what's up  Hey guys  I know you guys  Trying to wrap up  But I kind of wanted  To piggyback  Jimmy's point  About the duality  Of the characters  Because the guy  That shot Lorenz Tate  Is he Ryan Felipe  The guy who played  The cop  Who was originally  Matt Dillon's partner  Yes  Right  So he was this 
[04:05:00]  Do good cop  And stop judging people  Based upon  What they look like  And Lorenz Tate  Gets in the car  And he's so afraid  Of the guy  That he basically  Blows him away  And he leaves him  In the field  You know  It was a good scene  I really liked the movie  And I kind of disagree  With Patrice  No no wait a minute man  I'm not against  I'm just saying  My problem with the  Duality of man  Is that it happened  To all the characters  In the twine of the movie  That's all  I agree with you  The duality of man  But his duality  Had to be to shoot  One of the characters  It's like 
[04:05:30]  That affected him  If he did that  Why didn't he just  Shoot any arbitrary nigga  That's what would happen  In real life  I think they were  Trying to say  That that's it  In each one of us  And I mean  It would have been great  If they could have just  You know  Had 50 million actors  Trying to portray  Hey you two motherfuckers  Love that shit  You have  Deconstructed it  All I did was like  Ah fuck this  And your deconstruction  Outweighs my fuck it  You guys like it  More than I hate it  But you know what  Him shooting  There's one more point  Him shooting that guy  Again there's certain 
[04:06:00]  Anti-Hollywood things  I liked about it  And they always make  The idealistic guy like him  The hero  Who is without flaw  And in this case  You're like wow  Even a guy who thinks like this  Is a fucking fearful  Reactionary  Little racist shit too  It just reminds me  Of Pretty Woman  It just reminds me of  Pretty Woman was so good  You carry the hooker  You know  I love  Hooker make good  But I get what you're saying  Well this guy gets it  Topper and Reno 
[04:06:30]  Says you have a point there  Patrice  Topper  Hey guys  How you doing today  Good  Patrice you got a point  In what you're saying  Because in the first Batman  They cast Billy T. Williams  To be  You know  The black guy  Harvey Dent  And then realized  When they were making  A second Batman  That they screwed up  Because Harvey Dent  Turns into Two-Face  And they had to kill  White guy  So Billy T. couldn't  Replay his role  Because  Right  Because they added  They added  Mr. Black guy  That's what I  Here's the 
[04:07:00]  On in here  Here  Negroes  Where does this  I'm  I'm  I'll put  Whoever's black  In the comic  There's not many  Black comic book  Motherfuckers  But you know  Spawn  Spawn  And that movie  Suck balls  And Meteor Man  They've made  85  Meteor Man  They made 85  Punishers  Meteor Man  They can make  Another Spawn  That's better  Yeah  Or Power Man  They didn't care  No one  No one cared about Spawn 
[04:07:30]  A lot of  And they will not  Let Punisher suck  No  Thomas Jane did it  Shitty  What's his name  Did it  Dolph Lundgren did it  Did Dolph  Yeah  He did the original  Punisher  And Thomas Jane  Did it  And they both  Stunk  And they're doing  Another one  Wow  Cause he's white  That's right  Well maybe not  Ain't no second  Nigga characters  They'll have a  Green motherfucker  Come back for a  Second movie  Which is the Hulk  Before a bad  Nigga movie  Ain't no  Boys in the hood
