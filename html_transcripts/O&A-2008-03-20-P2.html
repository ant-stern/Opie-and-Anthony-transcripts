<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a shocking segment featuring comedian Bob Saget's disgusted yet humorous reaction to the "Two Girls, One Cup" video.  This transitioned seamlessly into a lengthy interview with Ricky Gervais.  Gervais discussed his career, including his experiences creating and working on both the UK and US versions of *The Office*, highlighting the comedic timing and awkward silences crucial to the show’s success, and the development of the character David Brent. He detailed the cultural differences between the British and American versions, promoted his show *Extras*, and shared anecdotes about the casting process, preferring unknown actors.  He also mentioned his podcast with Karl Pilkington, referencing Pilkington's quirky personality and infamous catchphrases, like "I could eat a knob at night," which was even made into a dance track.  Gervais spoke about co-writing a song with David Bowie, and his opinions on other celebrities like Larry David and Christopher Guest, often offering strong, negative, and humorous commentary.  Ron from "Ron and Fez" made a brief appearance, and the show’s producer, Roland, was frequently mentioned. Numerous listener calls expressed admiration for Gervais' work, with one caller sharing an emotional reaction to a Christmas special and another discussing finding solace in *The Office* after a breakup.  The segment concluded with a recording of a disastrous attempt to get a promotional announcement from the Iron Sheik, resulting in a rambling and hilarious performance.

Following the Gervais interview, a similar exercise in comedic frustration ensued with Jimmy Superfly Snooker, who, like the Iron Sheik, struggled with simple instructions. A caller, Bob, compared the two wrestlers' performances, noting the Sheik's apparent amphetamine use contrasted with Snooker's sobriety.  Further comedic moments involved a listener's anecdote about being chokedlammed and a discussion of using a Jim Brewer bit as a show exit strategy.  Jim Brewer then joined the studio, delivering a highly profane and chaotic comedic bit about his dog's reaction to a Razor Rollerboard scooter, culminating in a comical meltdown involving shouting, threats to call the police, and a dog hiding under the bed.

The show then took a short break, the hosts citing the need for decompression in their "confined environment with a bunch of volatile personalities," interrupted by a commercial for a self-tuning guitar.  A lengthy call with Jay Moore followed, pitching increasingly absurd ideas for a segment on his ESPN show, *More Sports*, involving Opie and Anthony.  These ideas ranged from massages and homoerotic scenarios with Ozzy Osbourne and Rakim to a three-way with Tara Reid and a steam room encounter with other celebrities.  Moore also shared news about his wife's pregnancy via in-vitro fertilization, leading to further comedic tangents.  The segment concluded with frustration over an overzealous censor, Craig, leading to heated arguments and threats towards his job.  A final brief conversation about Moore's appearance on *More Sports* and a selection of audio clips, including the "Jay Moore moan," concluded this segment.

The show resumed with discussions about Magic Johnson, the cost of coffee in South Central Los Angeles, and a joke about the LPGA and Annika Sörenstam.  A caller, Chris, led to jokes about massage and sexuality.  Discussion moved to an ESPN interview with Jay Moore and an anecdote about Bono’s perceived sex appeal.  Pre-recorded bits from Jay Moore, Patrice O'Neal, and Rich Voss followed, with Voss detailing an offensive stand-up performance at a bagel shop. Dave Attell then joined in studio, leading to a discussion of Chris Hansen from "To Catch a Predator," a "Wussy Skater Fight" YouTube video, and a previous confrontation with disruptive audience members at a comedy club.  Calls from Iraq, Canada, and Missouri followed, with discussions about performing for military personnel (Bill Burr’s reluctance was highlighted), Canadian culture, and the Canadian dollar. A listener criticized the show, and Jim Norton shared a story about a hooker encounter in Vancouver.  Doug Stanhope joined via phone, leading to a discussion about primordial dwarfs, the ethics of "To Catch a Predator," pedophilia, and various types of pornography.

The show then delved into a segment dominated by listener calls detailing unusual sexual experiences and practices.  Callers described inserting candle wax into a urethra, dildos in urethras, ball enlargement, penile splitting, and various extreme pornographic acts including scat play and urethral penetration; website links were even shared.  Doug Stanhope remained in studio, reacting to the callers' stories and explicit content. The hosts also discussed a Disturbed music video deemed too controversial by MTV and Opie's attendance at a Colin Quinn show featuring transgender singers.  The segment ended with further discussion of extreme pornography websites.

The following segment focused on Jim Norton's experience at a transgender nightclub with Colin Quinn, featuring descriptions of the performers Joey Arias and Raven O,  and homophobic slurs and speculation about Norton and Quinn’s sexuality. A caller mentioned Lakewood, Ohio’s large gay population.  The conversation included phone calls from other comedians, leading to a contentious interaction with Rich Voss regarding a potential comedy tour, filled with insults and personal attacks. The segment concluded with discussions about other comedians, including Otto and George, who were guests in the studio.

The show's final segment began with reminiscing about Otto’s unpredictable appearances, attributed to past cocaine use.  The hosts discussed career ambitions (or lack thereof), and a planned bed and breakfast trip, focusing on their crude plans to disrupt the stay. This segued into a discussion about helicopter crashes, playing an enhanced audio clip of an eyewitness account described as potentially involving sexual activity.  The hosts then engaged in dark humor regarding helicopter crashes and human fascination with violence and death, citing celebratory gunfire in Iraq resulting in casualties. The show concluded with promotions for upcoming comedy shows featuring Patrice O'Neal, Bill Burr, and Louis C.K., along with plugs for the show and sponsors.

[00:01:30]  Of the worst.  Of the comedians.  Of the O.P. and Anthony show.  Just hilarious, I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Really funny.  Really awful too, by the way, I'll acknowledge that.  Now presenting comedian Bob Saget.  It's the best of the worst of the comics on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Two girls, one cup for Bob Saget and Jeff Ross.  Good, right?  Huh?  Nice.  Oh. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, no.  I can't.  Come on, Bob.  I don't do poo.  Open your eyes.  I'm not a poo guy.  I can't do it.  That's your reaction.  Can't do it.  No, open your eyes.  Come on.  Can't.  Come on, Bob.  Can't do it.  Look, it's great.  Now open your eyes.  I'm quitting show business.  I'm not going to do this.  Jeff, are you looking at that?  Wipe that shit-eating grin off your face.  I cannot believe.  That was the grossest thing I've ever seen. 
[00:02:30]  No, keep watching.  Keep watching.  Come on.  It's almost over.  Well, they're going to puke.  That's what they always do.  You think Ken Burns found another second and a half?  Here we go.  Watch.  No, no.  The music does work for me because that's all I can do.  Oh, here we go.  Just to make it a little better.  No, no, no.  How do you guys watch it?  How do you not?  How do you?  I'm just not into, I'm not a poo guy.  Well, none of us are liars.  What's in it for these girls?  This night, that I knew was going to happen.  A bus token? 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  Well, it's bulimic.  All right.  All right.  Well, I think they have an eating disorder.  Yeah.  That's what I think.  I wonder if they scooped that out first.  As a dad.  Right.  As a father.  The director said, all right, look, don't puke into the shit cup too soon.  That's the climax.  Now I'm supposed to go on with my life?  That was the aristocrats.  That was the worst thing I've ever seen.  Wow.  That was really good. 
[00:03:30]  That'll stick with you.  How do they talk them into doing that?  What is it?  Lily, you were gagging?  I was gagging.  Lovely Lily.  Never seen it before.  You've never seen that?  Oh, yeah.  Ron and Fez, Noon 3.  Never in my life.  That's the most vile shit I've ever seen.  Wait, wait.  Where did you see it?  Oh, I was watching from there and Danny was forcing me to watch it.  Do they?  You look very good today, by the way.  Thank you.  You're dressed to solve a mystery.  It's that hat.  She's got her cute little detective's hat on.  It's my Annie Hall hat.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Now, did you have a good view of it? 
[00:04:00]  I did, yeah.  What was the worst part of it for you?  The shit.  And the girl.  Why was it green?  Oh, turn around.  No, no, no.  Just take a look.  Just turn around.  Do you like the cup?  No, I can't.  I can't.  No, no, take a look.  Please turn around.  Just take a look.  Just look.  Oh, my God, it's everywhere.  Just look.  No, no, take a look.  Take a look.  We got it on all 12 screens right now.  Oh, my God, it's disgusting.  We got it on 12 screens.  Just look at the girls with their dogs.  Look at it.  It's not that bad.  They must have put some sugar on you.  Run it fast, 12 to noon.  Look at it.  12 to 3. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, my God.  12 to noon.  It's a very brief show.  Oh, that's everywhere.  It's everywhere.  You can't turn around anywhere.  Oh, my God.  It's on every screen.  It's like being in heaven.  I can't look at it.  It's two girls, one cup in the round.  In the round.  I know.  I can see it.  It's everywhere.  Open your eyes, Lily.  Take a look.  Oh, she's gagging.  Oh.  Don't gag.  You're okay, Lily?  Run and Fez.  12 to 3.  Look at it for the vomiting of the shit.  Do it for Run and Fez.  What?  Do it for Run and Fez.  Do it for Run and Fez.  Oh, your eyes are tearing.  This part's the best part.  Watch. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, watch this part.  It's cute.  Watch.  They both just look so uncomfortable.  She's gagging.  They got big mouths full of shit.  The best part is they woke up and put makeup on, saying we got a big day.  We got a big shoot today.  How do people like that?  Well, they're interns.  I think it's more for the comedy.  That's more for the comedy.  That's Brazilian porn, man.  Wow, her eyes are tearing.  Is that Brazil?  Is that Brazilian?  Yeah, of course.  MFX?  Yes, they're all Brazilian.  Oh, poor Lily.  Her eyes are all teary from gagging.  Well, you know what you could do?  You could just puke into your hat. 
[00:05:30]  Easy clean up.  But I like my hat.  Rio Diarrho.  It's the best of the worst of the comics on the O.B. and Anthony Show.  O.B. and Anthony.  It's the best.  Boo!  The best of the worst of the comedians of the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Just hilarious.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Really funny.  Really awful, too, by the way.  I'll acknowledge that.  Holy mother of God. 
[00:06:00]  Now presenting comedian...  Ricky Gervais.  Hey, by the way, don't get comfortable. 
[00:06:30]  We've got a big star waiting to get in here.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Enjoy.  All right.  Maybe you should replace Ricky's seat so he doesn't have to sit in the same seat that  you were in.  Dust it off.  Steve.  That's his name.  Okay.  I'll remember that.  It's always good when Roland actually points to the cutouts of us to tell him, well, that  one's Opie and that one's Anthony.  That was just going on.  Good Roland.  Stop.  Would you spill your cereal?  I would just go like this and point to get him in here.  Dude, if anything goes into the board, you could be shot for that.  All right. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  What are we doing?  He's right there.  Let's get him in.  I know.  I've been watching him.  Very psyched.  I know.  I hope we're making him laugh.  He just got here.  Oh.  So he hasn't heard anything yet?  No.  Hasn't heard shit.  He just heard us be mean to an intern and you spill cereal and me chewing on his shirt.  Thank you.  Good night.  Yeah.  Let's bring him right in.  Yeah.  Why isn't he being brought right in?  Yeah.  Why is he being seated out there?  Please have Mr. Gervais put it.  There he is. 
[00:07:30]  How you doing, sir?  Don't mind me cleaning up cereal.  Yeah.  Oh, he feels compelled to eat.  This is being broadcast, is it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Believe it or not.  Surely you're going to tighten this up and then put it out.  Yeah, and then we record it and then we tighten it all up, take out the dead spots, unentertaining spots.  Right.  Let's start now.  Press play and record.  Just press play and record there.  Yeah.  Okay, we're on.  Now we're on.  Now we are actually doing a show.  That really doesn't make us feel good, but we hear it all the time.  Is this being heard by anybody? 
[00:08:00]  Listen.  Yeah, unfortunately.  It wasn't a criticism.  It was a compliment.  A lot of people come in and have no idea the show's actually on and they're just bullshitting,  talking about anything and then they'll go, you know, when do we start?  It's like you've been on for 20 minutes, just babbling, talking about how small their  penises are or they've been raped when they were a child or something that they didn't  want out over the air.  Roland had a point.  This is just like Letterman.  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  Roland pointed to our cutout so you know who's who, I bet, right?  He did indeed.  Yeah.  I saw that go down.  I'm like, oh, great. 
[00:08:30]  Did Roland tell you that he was vomiting and shitting last night walking on 73rd Street due  to food poisoning?  We're lucky we have him today.  Really?  Yeah.  Has he cleaned it up?  Probably not.  I'm really happy you're here.  I'm a little nervous, a little starstruck.  Big fan.  I know.  Big fan.  Really?  Yeah.  The Office.  I mean, ridiculous.  Love it.  Thank you very much.  Got the box set.  Wasn't watching it when it was originally on but got the box sets and just couldn't stop  watching the goddamn thing.  You are the consummate tool. 
[00:09:00]  The consummate jackass on that show.  I just watch it and go, how did he capture the essence of this middle management douchebag  so well?  It's so much fun to play the fool, the idiot.  In extras, I sort of play more the straight man, I suppose.  I'm more the normal guy.  I'm more the Tim character.  Yeah.  But it's so much fun to say the worst thing possible, just the most stupid thing you  could say.  It's so liberating.  I don't know how you get that.  How do you get the writing?  But you got to know how. 
[00:09:30]  Did you ever work with someone like that?  Yeah.  Well, I worked in an office for seven years.  Oh, okay.  That explains it.  That's where you get the management speak and the petty backbiting and all that.  Just that minutiae of life.  And you run into those people that just think they're funny.  Well, The Office was actually a comedy about comedy, I think.  I mean, we never said that at the time.  But it was always getting stuff off my chest about people who thought they were funny would  shout catchphrases and not have a mind of their own, really. 
[00:10:00]  They'd find each other because they all shouted, wazz up.  Yeah.  Just that sort of thing you want to go on.  Yeah, that's right.  I know.  What's up, huh?  What's up?  I love that.  Every office was doing that.  What's up?  There's a scene in season two where you do motivational speaking and it's one of the  most uncomfortable.  I was embarrassed for the cast.  It was like, how did you bring that out of me?  It was so good.  Well, it's so funny, isn't it?  Because it makes me cringe a little bit when I come in the baseball cap and try and be  cool and try and talk hip hop. 
[00:10:30]  But there's a bit of me that thinks, I wonder if there's anyone out there that thinks that  I think this is really cool.  You know, just for a split second.  And the press go, I go, oh, well, he's just like David Brent.  I go, no, I'm not like David Brent.  I'm not.  And I talk like him.  I used my voice and I used my face.  And it really annoys me that anyone thinks I'm like David Brent.  But you're not acting.  You just stepped into it.  It's the subtleties, too.  It's a real documentary.  Right, right, right.  It's the subtleties, too.  Like the way your eyes will kind of dart back and forth as you're talking, not even comfortable 
[00:11:00]  in your own skin.  Well, I was never trained as an actor.  But when I watched television, I always thought people overacted, oversold a point.  You don't need to.  You use your hands and you don't finish sentences.  You don't need to spell stuff out.  So it was sort of like an exploration into sort of, you know, body language.  And fidgeting with the tie when you're uncomfortable.  When someone's lying.  When they can't look someone in the eye.  Yeah.  It's one of those.  Yeah, it's such typical like body language.  You could totally read that, you know, you're uncomfortable.  You're lying.  You know, you're just bombed. 
[00:11:30]  I love when you even realized as your character that you just bombed and you slowly back out of  the room and kind of look and wait for some reaction that never comes.  Isn't a bad joke the worst thing in the world?  To be part of.  You know, in an office, someone makes a bad joke and you have to laugh politely.  But you're dying inside.  Yeah.  It's the worst feeling in the world pretending to.  It's interesting you say that because Jim Norton, to your left there, he brought something  great to this program.  And I have been doing radio a long time.  And when we try something and it bombs, we would get that uncomfortable feeling and want 
[00:12:00]  to move on quickly to the next thing.  As fast as humanly possible.  He was the one that brought it to our show to, wait a minute, slow down.  And let's enjoy that bomb for a while.  The first time it happened, like somebody said something and it completely bombed and  we were ready to move on.  And Jimmy, Jimmy goes, no, no, let that sit.  Yeah.  You let that just sit and simmer now.  And I'm sitting there going, what?  You crazy?  Why would you do that?  I think you've got to get a sound effect.  When everyone makes a really bad joke, just the sound of like tumbleweed. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, no, we got that.  We do have the crickets.  We're on the same page.  We got crickets.  And then we got this one.  Dead silence and then...  Oh, he's getting hit.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah, dead silence.  And the car wreck.  These are all the ones we...  Oh, one cough in a church hole.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, is that a good one?  Can we play all of them?  Can we play them all for them?  Yeah.  If you do it...  You got them on?  Come on.  If you do a bad joke in this show, you get one of the following.  Make sure he's on first. 
[00:13:00]  You're on?  Me, me, me, me.  Can you hear me?  Yeah.  He doesn't want to mess up that hair of his.  I guess you're doing TV today, huh?  Yeah.  All right.  So you get the, you know, the classic.  Yeah.  Then you get the Kelsey Grammer.  He just fell down.  Falling down.  Then we get, you know...  The old game show ending.  Still good.  Yeah.  And then over the top...  And then we did Price is Right.  When you get the price wrong. 
[00:13:30]  So we enjoy a good bombing on this show.  What you should do, though, you wouldn't need those if you just made good jokes all the time.  Now, see?  I mean, a lot of work's going into those, but we could eradicate those.  Let's just do good jokes from now on.  Why didn't we ever think of that?  The subtle...  Here's another great part of season two is that they bring in new people and new characters,  and one of them is a girl in a wheelchair, and you're constantly moving her.  It's constantly, like, adjusted, but it's never really, like, I don't think spoken about. 
[00:14:00]  It's just constantly, like, pulling her back a little bit or moving her forward, just always violating her.  You'd never do that to anybody.  You'd never just pick someone up and move them out of the way.  You'd say, excuse me.  But because it's on wheels, bang.  You know, and I know that happened to people, you know, people that said, you know, sometimes  at a party, someone would just move you out of the way, because they can.  And, of course, also, he wants to be seen as helping disabled people.  So every opportunity, he wants to be the one on camera. 
[00:14:30]  That's why he's doing it.  Everything he does is because it's being filmed.  Absolutely everything.  Right, right.  That's why we had to make it so clear that it was a documentary all the time.  We had to keep reinforcing that.  Because without that, it's a boring sitcom, but when you suddenly know he's acting that  it's because he wants to be famous, it suddenly sort of comes to life.  That's what makes it so real is how you work your eyes, like, shifting and all are comfortable  and stuff.  Knowing you're being filmed.  Exactly.  The zero improv skills with the big rubber penis.  Exactly. 
[00:15:00]  That's the one I was watching last night, yeah.  You just grab it, and you've got nothing.  You've got nothing.  But before you grow up, it's so – I can't watch it.  Well, even improv to me is, I think, sort of easier to do than watch anyway.  Because when you're watching these guys, even if they're good professionals, you're  thinking, just make it rhyme if they're doing a song, or just make this funny enough.  You know, it's just torturous to watch anyway, someone desperate.  Just so everyone knows the scene, there's a big, you know, blown up dick.  Yeah, rubber. 
[00:15:30]  And you guys were trying to figure out, you know, things you could do with this.  This, and what's his name, grabbed it, but he had nothing.  And you grab it back like, look, don't waste anyone's time.  Only grab it if you have one.  And then you awkwardly had nothing.  Had nothing.  Or the relationship.  I love the relationship with Awful Finchie, who he idolizes in the show.  And then Finchie does nothing but, like, awful jokes, too.  But he just thinks the fuck is the greatest.  Well, Finch was introduced to show you that David Brent wasn't really a bastard.  He was a bit of a prat, you know.  He was a fool, he was near, but he wasn't a nasty man. 
[00:16:00]  Finch was brought in to show you what a nasty man was.  A bully.  With no, not an ounce of, you know, artistry in him.  Just nasty, nasty one-upmanship.  Right.  So that was great fun to play, because Brent, of course, thought they're a double act,  but everyone could see Finch treats him like everyone else.  He doesn't care about anyone but himself.  Yeah.  So it was quite nice at the end to tell him to fuck off.  And any of the nastiness that your character's playing is obviously because of your ignorance.  Because the practical joke firing of Dawn, I guess, the receptionist, and she starts crying. 
[00:16:30]  And you're just, you obviously felt bad about it.  You didn't know how to deal with it.  And when she just goes, you're sorry, little man.  Sad little man.  Yeah.  You're a sad little man.  And then you're just like, all right.  All right.  You don't know what to do.  Being caught out on camera is it's that thing.  Because we came out of a spate of these reality game shows and docu-soaps in England in the 90s,  where normal people just followed at work, and they became sort of famous. 
[00:17:00]  And then they milked it.  They went on everything that they could for 10 minutes.  And now we have shows like Big Brother.  And before they go in, they get an agent, because they think this is it.  Yeah.  This is going to be the star maker for them.  Then they're dead after.  Because they're not doing anything.  The things that they do on Big Brother and film in England is unbelievable.  Yeah.  I've read about it.  I haven't seen it here.  There was one woman who went on there and shoved a wine bottle up her vagina. 
[00:17:30]  Wow.  On regular TV, by the way, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, they did.  Because we want to get into that video.  She's going to be a star.  But what does her parents think?  Yeah.  That's her ticket to fame.  Right.  Yeah.  Hey.  Saw her on TV.  Oh, what was she up to?  She was up to the label.  With that said, what do you think of American TV?  I love it.  I think it's the best in the world.  You really?  Genuinely.  Don't you think we're uptight, though, with some of the things we can't do or say on TV?  Well, yeah, but that's network.  Network, yeah.  There's no restriction.  Well, cable, finally, yeah. 
[00:18:00]  I mean, HBO's got most of the best programs ever.  Right.  But, I mean, you look at things like, I've been a fan of American stuff, particularly comedy  from Lauren Hardy.  And then you've got all these great iconic shows, MASH and Cheers, and then stuff like  Arrested Development and Kirby Enthusiasm.  Right.  You know, we're not doing anything like that, you know, really.  Yeah, Kirby Enthusiasm.  I certainly feel I've got more empathy with the American models and the way, you know,  the writers, directors do here as opposed to, you know, in England. 
[00:18:30]  And I think you've got the greatest stuff coming out of it.  And stuff like Sopranos.  I mean, it's beat in film, you know.  Right.  It's a, they churn those out.  It's like an art factory.  The quality doesn't go down, and yet they get it right for season after season.  See, this is how stupid I am.  I think every show in Britain is like The Office.  I think there's a million sitcoms like that.  Although yours, you know, is brilliant and stuff.  I'm like, oh, God, they're just so much more creative over there.  Well, you probably get the best ones.  I mean, is there a lot of good shows over there in Britain on the BBC? 
[00:19:00]  We've got more chance to let things breathe.  I mean, you know, because the stakes are so much higher in America,  and things cost a little bit more, you know,  you can be cancelled after the second episode.  Whereas, you know, The Office scored the lowest ever focus group on its channel,  joint bottom with women's bowls.  But they kept with it.  Now, that could have been cancelled, but they kept with it.  Because it's such an odd concept and such a different show that you maybe,  if you watch that first episode, you don't quite understand what's going on. 
[00:19:30]  Well, we did that on purpose.  We wanted people to think, is this a documentary?  I haven't seen anything like this before.  This is slow.  It's almost like anti-television, you know, no laugh track, no jokes, no famous people.  So you can see how...  On paper, it sounds terrible, doesn't it?  You can see how a focus group, though, because focus groups, they got it.  They didn't laugh.  Yeah.  They didn't get it.  But the thing is, I must say, that also some people in the BBC didn't laugh and didn't get it.  Right.  So, you know...  But they allowed it to find its own audience.  We were low risk.  Right.  It cost nothing.  I think the first one cost like $100,000.  No kidding.  Which is nothing. 
[00:20:00]  I mean, that would be a title sequence over here.  And, you know, it gave us the chance.  We went out on a Monday night in the summer, which is, you know...  But then when it started growing, then we got the repeat, and things started moving then.  To be fair, they leave us alone.  Me and Stephen, you know, got to do it.  Why only two seasons and, what, 12 total episodes, right?  Well, just because we do it all ourselves, and it is exhausting.  You know, we don't have a team of writers.  We don't have a team of producers.  It's not like a...  It really is like a little cottage industry, and we worry about everything. 
[00:20:30]  We do our own press.  We do our own design.  We do the sleeve.  So, we do it.  You know, it took us three years, and then that was it.  And loads of people have let me down.  You know, I've seen great things in the third season, fourth season.  It's just terrible.  They took the money and ran.  You just felt like it was time to end it.  Yeah, and I think, shame on you.  Also, because the conceit is a fake documentary.  It'd be like the Truman Show.  This team hanging around an office forever was a bit weird.  But we had other ideas.  You know, we just wanted to move on.  Do you know, I like the show so much. 
[00:21:00]  The first two seasons, obviously, I bought the special with them.  I have not watched the special yet, because I don't like the idea that there's no more.  It bums me out so much that there's no more episodes.  The special's slightly different.  No, I know.  I like to know that there's something left with these guys that I don't know yet.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it bugs me that it's over.  I had that feeling with Sopranos.  I didn't watch it when it went out.  And then we got all sort of five seasons that we had on DVD.  And the last sort of season we were watching, we started rationing ourselves.  Yeah, you don't want it to be over.  And the way we watched the last one, it was just awful. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  I think American TV's great.  I still watch Columbo.  I just can't believe how end of its time it is.  It's just so stylish.  I catch those every time they're on.  And it's amazing how many real directors went on to, you know, Spielberg directed a few.  And you're watching.  I've watched some Columbo's and gone, this is Spielberg.  And you know it just by the way it looks.  And then the end sequence comes and you see it was Spielberg directed.  Patrick McGeehan did a few.  He got in these times.  Yeah.  I've been in a few. 
[00:22:00]  I love the villains they use.  And comics are always touching on Columbo, how it's never just some guy that's, you  know, robbed a gas station and shot someone.  It's always an art dealer.  A rich, someone overprivileged who gets their comeuppance.  And never knows how to shut the fuck up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I can't understand how the footprints got under the window when the mud wasn't here from a  storm last night.  Ha, Lieutenant, Lieutenant.  It's obvious the man took his shoes off and went, you know, I should have seen that. 
[00:22:30]  And the guy never knows to just shut his fucking mouth.  He was getting away with it.  Yeah.  You were getting away with it.  Like, lawyer up or something, you dope.  Well, I watch it with my girlfriend and whenever Columbo goes, that explains it.  I go, he's got away with it.  Yeah.  That's it.  That's it.  Okay.  We might as well turn it off.  Stop the hook.  Yeah.  Well done.  That's a perfect crime.  Just watch someone else.  And it's always some little thing, too.  Like, one thing was an earring in a trunk.  Really? 
[00:23:00]  Which, as evidence, would be kind of nothing.  It's like, you know, I found a earring in his trunk.  And it's like, I killed her because she was cheating on me.  And the guy just completely spills his guts.  But there's one one I saw that was really bizarre, where Columbo gets the mafia involved.  And they help him out.  It's a whole thing.  This whole elaborate.  But it's just great.  The thing about Columbo is, you know who did it from the beginning.  Right.  Right from the start.  You know Columbo knows.  You know he's going to get caught.  So what you're waiting for is when Columbo tells him how he got caught. 
[00:23:30]  The pinch.  Right.  And it's just so classy.  Yeah.  No shows are really done like that.  It's like, the payoff is right at the beginning of the show.  Straight away.  Which is also a piss off.  You missed the first minute, you're done.  Yeah.  It's like, it would be like five after six.  And you go, oh, Columbo's on.  Shit.  I have no idea what's going on.  I know.  I love it.  You can't sit through two hours.  How elaborate the murders are as well.  Then it's involved.  It's great.  The one with the record player and a string.  So when a book falls to make someone downstairs think a gun was fired. 
[00:24:00]  It's like, who's setting up an elaborate murder like this?  Just hit him with a frigging ball peen hammer and leave it dark.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Oh, that's so great.  I love that fucking show, man.  But what do you think of the American office?  I love it.  Yeah.  I think they did a good job.  Good adaptation of the...  You know, the press were against them to begin with.  Because where the office made a mark in America was in the industry, really.  Yeah.  And so when this came along, they were going, it's doomed.  And I think they did everything right. 
[00:24:30]  I think Steve Carell's amazing.  I think the cast is great.  Greg Daniels is such a great, great presence.  I mean, it's, you know, it's slightly different.  It's probably, it's got to be slightly different.  You know, it's a very slightly broader, I think.  You know, he's better at his job.  But I just think you probably don't get that sort of office.  You know, in England, you can survive to your 65 doing really bad, bad stuff.  But no one fires you.  My girlfriend brought up a good point when we were watching your version. 
[00:25:00]  The American version, they kind of hide their contempt for each other.  Where you guys let it out a little more.  Like, your contempt of each other sitting there and just being pissed off.  And you'll let people know, like, you don't like this person.  Yeah, that's true.  Where there's more phoniness.  But that's how it works in America.  That's more American, yeah.  Yeah, that's how it is in America.  It's like there's this phoniness here in an office where.  You'll tell everybody but the person.  Yeah, you won't tell that person.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Because I think that there's a misconception that the English are very, very reserved and can't get out their feelings. 
[00:25:30]  But I think when it comes to sort of, like, bitchiness.  Then, yeah, we do.  That's what you do after work.  You sit down every night and go, oh, you're not happy to me.  And it's sort of like that camaraderie, I suppose.  Yeah, we do.  I suppose we do, yeah.  Yeah, and I saw, I was like, who's that girl?  I know the girl Dawn and stuff.  And she was from Shaun of the Dead.  That's it.  She got, yeah, with Simon Pegg.  Yeah, you know Simon?  I love him.  I think he's amazing.  And he's got a new film coming out called Dawn. 
[00:26:00]  Has he been on here?  He's supposed to come in.  We have him booked.  That movie is amazing.  He's so funny.  He's got hysterical.  He's got a funny little head as well.  Yeah, yeah.  He's got a cartoon head.  Tell him he looks like Charlie Brown that grew up.  He's lovely, Simon.  He's great.  That is one of my go-to movies.  Like, I will just pop that on and, you know, you can't help but just love it and love the  characters and stuff.  But you, you, you, he's such a nice, funny man as well.  I can't wait to, yeah.  Oh, he's great.  He's great.  I'll tell you. 
[00:26:30]  When's he coming on?  I don't know.  We got to work that out.  When?  I'll tell him.  I love it.  Roland, have you noticed Roland are, are, he's coming in April.  In, uh, April.  In April?  Yeah, that's when he's coming for you.  You wore an office shirt for today.  You, you are just such a tool sometimes.  I like it.  I hope it's a bootleg and you get in trouble.  I know.  It's a real thing they sent to me.  It's official.  It's official?  Yeah.  He gets a little nervous and he has a very hard time talking on mic.  Well, why don't we show him? 
[00:27:00]  Which is, uh, just horrid.  He's a great booker for the show, but when it comes to actually talking about stuff, what  do you like about The Office?  He's a behind-the-scenes guy.  The English version of The Office.  The English version?  Yeah.  Well, no, the, the, it's just called The Office in English.  Yeah.  It's called The Office.  It's the American version.  Yeah, you're right.  You're right.  No, it's funny, witty.  Ricky's amazing in it.  All right, why is he amazing?  He's hysterical.  I'm not going to have, I'm going to have this sort of bullying when he's being nice about me.  I'm on his side. 
[00:27:30]  It's just me and you against the rest of them.  Okay, right, let's keep this fair.  Okay, you go for it.  But he's very shallow.  He doesn't, he won't give you any substance to why he likes anything.  No, you never get deep.  He can never get deep.  And when it gets really uncomfortable, don't say a word, because that's when this bit gets  really good.  Just, all right, so why is he amazing in The Office, Roland?  Um, just his comedy style, his writing, uh, his timing with the cast, Steve Murchin.  You.  You were terrible. 
[00:28:00]  That's fine.  You just let him have it.  There was nothing wrong with that at all.  You know what?  That was actually his besties, the besties ever done.  Ever.  I've seen smoother testimony in child-balesting trials.  They said you'd seen a lot of those.  From Roland.  You did good.  Don't worry about it.  All right, thank you.  What's, um, what's, uh, the deal with Extras? 
[00:28:30]  What's that?  What's the deal with Extras and why am I asking you?  I don't know.  Extras is on HBO.  On, uh, now, I think that you just, it's the second season two.  It's kind of the way we get, so you can plug it and tell people that don't know what it's  about.  Let's not be subtle about this.  Will you guys always schedule for season two?  I think I'm here to hang out with you guys.  Sell.  Sell, you're right.  I've lived 3,000 miles to meet you.  No, no, uh, I did.  I did, I did.  I couldn't make it last time.  I was down to do it last time. 
[00:29:00]  We had you on the phone once.  I know, yeah, I remember that.  No, it was great.  Um, so what's the Extras about, though?  It's a little weird to have Extras on HBO.  Explain that.  Um, well, it's, uh...  Is it you guys doing the commentary, or...  I'm confused.  I have no idea.  No, no, no, no.  The show's called Extras.  Oh, the show Extras.  Oh, my God, duh.  Holy shit, I'm thinking DVD Extras.  I'm sorry.  No, well, yeah.  Car crash.  I'm heating up.  Does anybody remember last time?  Holy crap, what a loser. 
[00:29:30]  It's a show called Extras.  No, I know.  It follows.  Yeah.  Um, great.  Great.  You play...  The beautiful thing is, he's like an extra in it, and it's like you play...  You're very good at playing, like, just a simple guy.  Like, you make regular people interesting.  An office manager, an extra.  That's what I love about it.  It's like, you don't need to play the big shot.  You just play just an average ass and make them fascinating.  I don't think it's fun to play the big shot, either, is it?  I just think, when I start giving myself roles about a cop who lost his badge because he was drunk,  and now his wife's been kidnapped and he's going to get the badge, that's when you know it's finished. 
[00:30:00]  When you start believing that.  When you only take roles, where, can I have a gun?  Well, no, not really.  Oh, can I have a gun?  Well, an office manager wouldn't have a gun.  I think he might.  I think he might have a gun.  Yeah.  Just playing the regular guys.  It's fun to play the pucks.  It's much more fun playing David Brent than Andy Millman in many ways because it's, you,  and also, when you're playing the pucks, you can put other cast members off.  That's the most fun for me, actually putting them off while I'm playing. 
[00:30:30]  Right, right.  Whereas if you're playing the straight man, you can't really.  So, you know, I need, I need something else to keep my interest up.  It's so, it's so odd to watch that because you don't think you're acting watching it.  Like, is it, do you find it difficult to play that character because it's so natural?  When I watch The Office, I'm like, this is a guy, you know, this guy.  I've, you know, I've worked with these people, guys like this.  Do you find it harder to act like that? 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, I am, I don't find acting that hard.  Really?  Really.  And I never get lost in the role.  Very rarely you get lost in the role.  This is the misconception where people say, oh, I'm so into it.  Yeah.  You're not.  You're thinking of lunch.  And you're going, oh, they're not meant to stand there.  You know, you don't get lost.  You're not one of those.  You know.  You know, he taught me so much, my character.  Everything puts me off.  I'll tell you what, the cameraman puts me off, which is a bad thing.  Yeah, I'd say, can I go further back?  A light puts me off.  So now I don't get lost in the role. 
[00:31:30]  But maybe a few you get caught up in.  Some of the drama moments are more exciting than comedy, really.  I remember one that we did where David went out to cry for his job back.  And there you get really into it.  You really get, you try and, you know.  Where he begs not to be redundant.  That was a great scene.  It's like the one scene where he breaks down.  Well, that's the one scene I felt like a real actor as opposed to a bloke trying to make people laugh.  But no, most of the time you're thinking, oh, these shoes are annoying me. 
[00:32:00]  Or, oh, God.  Oh, he's sniffing.  The cameraman's sniffing.  You know, everything.  I really, anything puts me off, honestly.  Because it's, you want it to get it just right.  And, you know, and I do get hungry very quickly and lunch is coming.  And I start thinking, oh, come on.  So, no, I'm not one of those people that worries about my method.  And do you find that it's difficult to have such hands-on with a project like that?  No, it's easier.  It's easier?  You see, this is the thing about middle management.  It's either no responsibility where you leave and that's it or total responsibility. 
[00:32:30]  It's being caught in that middle ground where you can't do everything you want and you have to compromise.  But, you know, you have to do certain things.  So, no, I'd rather be in charge or just turn up and go home.  It's that.  Yeah, definitely.  Yeah, it's easier.  It's the long days, though, I guess.  Well, if you're in charge, you can do anything.  So, I can suddenly go, I think David Redd would sit down for this.  Which is fun, yeah.  Rewrite.  They capture everything perfect.  It's like even things that aren't – like my favorite two scenes in the whole series were both non-comic scenes. 
[00:33:00]  One was that scene where he asked for his job back and one was when Tim turns the microphone off.  Mine, too.  That's my one and two and they happen after each other.  And we swapped them around in the edit as well.  Originally, we were going to end with the – we thought we should end with the other way around.  Oh, the Dolly Parton line?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Apparently, there's a country station that uses that as a jingle. 
[00:33:30]  And I just think of – it's the one where I go, Dolly Parton, if you want the rain, you've got to put up with the rain, well, you've got to put up with the rain.  And people say, it's just a big pair of tits.  And I just think of Dolly Parton listening to country radio.  And suddenly, here's someone talking, why are they saying that about me?  What's that from?  There's this DJ just saying that.  It's just strange.  I'm Dolly Parton.  But this is where you're getting a Mackenzie Croc, right?  Did I say his name?  He's giving you the massage.  And he's just giving him – you're sitting there.  He's standing behind him.  And he's giving him – it's the awful massage that someone gives you at an awkward moment.  It's the stiff, like, just kneading the hands on the neck. 
[00:34:00]  And it doesn't feel good.  And you can tell it doesn't feel good.  And that's the – you've captured that.  That's the longest pause we've ever done.  That's the longest silence we ever did.  We timed it.  Oh, wow.  That's the amusement, yeah.  Just like a couple of nerds going, that's the longest we've ever gone without saying  anything.  Just looking at the camera.  That is the most fun in the world, to look at a camera.  It's the most – I mean, I miss it in everything I do, which is a problem for an activist.  Yeah, because you don't look at the fucking camera.  Absolutely, I just want to go – just turn around and just stare straight down the lens.  Holy shit, that was the look. 
[00:34:30]  It's – it's so much fun.  That was the look for a split second, you bastard.  A hundred years ago.  They nailed it a hundred years ago.  Just the idea of that I'm with this idiot.  And that's – you know, that's just a –  This is radio.  People at home are going, he's looking at the camera.  Fuck off.  I'm entertained as hell.  I just got to tell people out there because it's a very good visual.  There's a scene that Jimmy always brought up as hysterical, and I finally got to say it.  When you're listening to the answering machine, your answering machine with that hot girl in the – yeah. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, yeah, listening back, yeah.  And you're listening to like, no, no, you're just like talking back to it.  And then you go to throw it out the window as a joke and turn around and you drop it.  It falls right in the trash can.  First take.  I was so lucky.  You wanted it to go in the trash can.  Of course, yeah.  And so it looked great.  It looked great.  And then it's broken, and you're just an ass.  You look.  I can't believe my luck. 
[00:35:30]  It falls.  I go, oh.  And you can say – I can see it that I go, wow, what a shot.  It's just that fell straight in the cap.  Oh, is that perfect?  It was like slapstick and perfect embarrassment.  Right.  It was exactly what happens when you're trying to be funny in front of a chick and you stink.  It was exactly what happens.  It was perfect fucking thing.  He's just trying to be a goof, and he drops it in the garbage like a boob, and right there  you're emasculated.  You cannot recover from that.  There's no coming back.  Oh, dear.  Love it, man.  We should go to the phones.  Everybody wants to say hi here. 
[00:36:00]  Andrew and Queens.  Well, you don't have to put them on.  Maybe put them – because you've got to save your hair for TV.  We'll put them in the back.  Listen, my – I don't –  Do that Gary Owens, Ronan Martin.  Go old-time radio.  All right, here we go.  Andrew from Queens.  What's up, Andrew?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  Just a big fan of Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merch, and I think there's a couple of great  writers, and I was fortunate enough to catch the whole second season of extras, and I've  got to say some of the best stuff I've seen on TV in a while.  And I think next week's episode with Danny Radcliffe is the most deuce-chilling, embarrassing 
[00:36:30]  thing I've ever seen on TV.  And I've got to say my favorite moment on extras is that scene where he just dances like  a fool, and there's just that quiet silence at the end, and he just has to slowly step  back and go back.  It's just – I can't – it's just really funny for me to watch, better than American  TV than I've seen in a long, long time.  Wow.  And I just want to know if – because I watched the end of extras, if there's going 
[00:37:00]  to be a third season to that.  Probably not.  We're not going to say never like we did with The Office, but probably not because, as  I say, it takes so much, and we put everything into it.  I mean, we're running out of megastars.  I think there's only Bono and God left.  But more, really, because we've got other things to do in them, because we do everything  ourselves.  I'm going to run out of breaths.  You're brave.  Yeah, I'm going to die before I do – I don't want to die having done two things. 
[00:37:30]  Most people would take it right to the end.  They would do 10 seasons.  What the hell?  No, that's what the remake's for.  Steve Carell's making me money, and I'm just sitting on the couch.  Oh, is that great?  So long live the American office.  Come on, Carell.  Keep going.  Syndication, baby.  Would you ever make a guest appearance on that?  Well, that would be huge.  Maybe.  What I thought – I wanted to maybe have them watching extras, and Steve Carell come along  and go, oh, yeah, no, I don't like this guy.  They should do a remake.  Right. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, that is good, yeah.  I would love to see it in the American setting.  I would actually love to.  Somehow, someway, I think that would be a home run.  The awful bombing trying to be – when you were trying to compete with Neil in season  two for the affection of everybody.  Maybe I could do that.  Maybe they could meet, and they'd be just best buddies, me and Steve Carell.  That would be massive.  Michael Scott and David Brent.  Let's say hi to Mike in Brooklyn.  Mike, what's up?  How's it going, Ricky, man?  Huge fan.  Thank you very much.  Second season of X's may be better than The Office.  Just hysterical.  Count Fucula, nobody's – 
[00:38:30]  That guy is a comedic find.  You've got to put him on again.  Thank you very much.  Talking about douche chills, Opie and Jim, you guys got to watch this.  Watch the Christmas episode and then check out extras.  Yeah, I mean –  Where did you see – how did you see the whole second season of extras then?  I haven't seen – I've only – HBO's giving you like an extra week advance.  Oh, right.  So you saw the one with like –  Oh, right, great.  Have you seen –  Yeah, they do a one week extra.  So I saw the one with the Down syndrome kid like a week in advance. 
[00:39:00]  You know, I'll be DVRing extras.  Absolutely.  Classic.  And your music career, man.  Keep it up for that new album.  Thank you.  Fantastic.  But before you go, another great moment.  I'm just going to annoy you with fucking office moments that made me happy to be alive.  Yeah, people telling me how good I am really annoys me.  Carry on.  When you do the motivational speaking and you're just trying to get out and you push – and the fucking maid walks in, the lady to clean the place, that's – he's trying to have a dramatic moment and this cleaning lady walks through the door in front of a whole – it was so uncomfortable. 
[00:39:30]  There you go, it's great.  Just making me happy.  It's fun making yourself look more of a putsch than you are.  So I can't have a pair of trousers that fits me.  I have to have one too small, so I bulge.  Yeah.  That's very funny.  A middle-aged man squeezing into jeans too small for him.  It's intimately funny.  It's already funny.  Yeah.  When you're with the consultant, I guess, with the overhead projector and you're trying to make everything about you.  That's my favorite episode.  Oh, my God.  Was that fucking funny.  And just the idea that this – again, this middle-aged man suddenly thinks that he can remind him that he was a rock star once. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Just the idea.  Just starts singing.  And, yeah, he's there playing his guitar and it's like, oh, he went home and got it.  And you just picture what everybody else is doing while you're going home just thinking that people are going to love this.  It's going to be great.  Yeah.  Acting out scenarios and he's not playing his role right.  Acting out the scenario with the hotel thing.  There's been a rape upstairs.  There was just fantastic stupidity. 
[00:40:30]  Who would say something like that?  Lots of people would to get attention.  Yeah, yeah.  That's one of the themes that we do is grabbing attention, trying to be famous, trying to –  So from the office right through to extras.  It's those people that would do anything just to – they're just saying love me or I'll kill myself.  Yeah.  Where the hell does that come from?  Because it's not just the acting, which is great.  The writing is amazing.  Thank you very much.  You know, where does that – is it part of your upbringing or your attention whore?  No, I didn't read books. 
[00:41:00]  I didn't particularly, you know, do stuff like writing.  So it was more trying to nail what you see in everyday life because it had to be real.  And so it was really trying to emulate real stuff.  Did you, as a person growing up, always want to be the center of attention?  Yes, then I lost it.  I think I was a brat because I had older brothers and sisters that you had to compete with.  But then I think I'd lost that for a little while. 
[00:41:30]  And now, particularly in public, I've lost it completely.  You know, before I used to wind up my friends, but now they can just go, look, everybody, it's Ricky Gervais.  And I go quiet and have to hide.  So I suppose I've got Shire, really, just in public.  Yeah, more recognizable, yeah.  Yeah, exactly, because it just seems a little bit weird.  It's a bit creepy.  It must be odd going from local because I'm sure in England you couldn't go out without people recognizing you.  I'm like Albus.  Yeah, there you go. 
[00:42:00]  Exactly.  In the sense that I eat burgers at 3 a.m.  What a great diet he had.  He just died.  How do you not love someone that eats fucking peanut butter and banana sandwiches and dies shitting?  What a blow to all fucking women that was.  Well, actually, he died not shitting.  Oh, was he not shitting?  That was the problem, I think.  He was trying.  I think he burst his brain straining.  That's the thing.  I think so, yeah.  Yeah.  He was trying.  That's good.  But now you come over to the U.S. now, where you were probably safe from being recognized,  and now people are recognizing you here.  But you know what?  It's sort of slightly different. 
[00:42:30]  It's different for loads of reasons.  One is it's not on your doorstep.  It gives you the creeps more if it's right on your doorstep.  Yeah.  It makes more sense in America as well.  It sort of makes more sense to be famous in America than it does in England.  Really?  And that's just an attitude.  That's odd.  No, it's really strange.  Is it kind of also because you're here, when you're here, you're here on business?  Absolutely.  So it's all right.  It might change if I lived here and, you know, I think it's that feeling.  It comes with the territory, yeah.  It's claustrophobic.  If you're famous, and I'm, you know, not here so much, but in England, it's claustrophobic 
[00:43:00]  because you're never not famous.  You can't turn it off.  Right.  So you can never go, that'd be the best of both worlds.  You know, you're famous when you need to jump a queue, but then you're not famous when  you're shopping for pants.  But you can't have that.  You can't have that.  You know, so you can't pick and choose.  Yeah.  And I refuse to wear a beard.  John Mayer came into the comedy show last week.  He had the worst fake mustache I've ever seen.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, he came upstairs.  I guess he's been getting hassled because of Jessica Simpson, but it was the worst fake mustache.  Did people recognize him?  When he put shoe polish on your face and talk jive, stupid. 
[00:43:30]  He didn't, he's not a real mustache.  What's a good fake mustache, though?  Just one that looks like it was grown.  I mean, that looked like somebody had thrown it at him and he caught it under his nose, like,  with luck.  Did everyone recognize him as John Mayer with a really bad fake mustache?  I don't know.  Because that would be even worse.  I don't, well, he took it off once he was upstairs, but like when I saw him walking by,  I just wanted to hug him.  I'm like, that's the fucking worst thing I've ever seen, John.  Could you just clip and wear a Hitler one?  Because who would talk to anybody with a Hitler mustache?  Nobody.  I'm spouting his philosophies. 
[00:44:00]  Do you know that Hitler based his image on Charlie Chaplin?  That's true.  His image.  I always wondered why he got that idea.  No, he was fascinated by Charlie Chaplin.  He watched The Great Dictator twice.  And, um, that's true.  So he kind of made and ruined that whole look, that mustache look for everybody.  That would have been really popular if he hadn't come along and ruined it, yeah.  Like, after 1945, who wore that mustache?  I know.  A little thin mustache.  Well, no one's calling their kids Adolf anymore, either.  No.  He killed that name.  And it's never come back. 
[00:44:30]  Even like the old, you know, the old circus weightlifter, curly, waxed handlebar mustache,  you occasionally see some.  Usually a band.  A retro rock band would go, and let's all have Hitler mustaches.  Yeah.  They don't.  Do they?  And what about the thing?  You never see, hey, Bob, you know, I would come into work with a little Hitler mustache.  You'd be like, they'd look at you like, what the fuck is this guy doing?  And what about the guys?  That's the only way they look good.  Well, yeah.  Some people, they know they look better with facial hair.  Well, exactly.  And you're one of these guys, you know, man, I would look like a 10 if I could just throw 
[00:45:00]  that Hitler mustache.  Well, that's the goatee is, you know, it looks good.  And I tried to grow one once, and I thought I looked like Robert De Niro in Angel Heart,  but it doesn't work like that.  It comes through dry and ginger and it.  Yeah, I'm at the point where it's like, I'm about ready to get rid of this.  Now, yours looks good.  It's too much gray.  Because usually it's a fat man beard.  Usually a fat guy will wear that.  It gives them a bit of a chin.  Illusion of a chin.  Yeah.  People think it stops there, actually.  My face stops where the hair is.  Exactly, yeah.  And we got a big...  Hey, Ronnie. 
[00:45:30]  I have no idea.  A big radio star.  Ronnie.  Ricky Gervais.  Hello.  I was just here to hang out.  Let me tell you something.  This son of a bitch has not shown up before 12.01 and his show starts at noon.  What?  He's on after us.  In years.  He's on a show after us.  Ron from Ron and Fez.  Nice to see you.  He's never here early.  Never here early.  He's always here late.  No, here's the thing.  I was told you were going to be here at 10 today.  So I was going to come in early, act like I was just running on board in the background  just to hang out.  Yeah.  I know.  The car arrived. 
[00:46:00]  I felt bad just letting a guy sit out in the street in a car.  So let's use it.  Let's get here early.  But see, now I got this imaginary slight Mark David Chapman thing going on where I'm just...  Why would he do this?  Why would he come in early?  He's just waiting outside with a gun.  But I was listening to you guys coming in.  Frightening.  Gush you a little more.  You guys should be gushing more.  Yeah, a little more.  You think we should?  Yeah.  Just a tad.  Someone said that the Chris Farley show came to 202.  It's true.  You're awesome.  I tried to get him off it by talking about Hitler.  But it didn't work. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, a little Hitler.  They said, they said, they said, you'd make a great Hitler.  Yes.  Every question is just so, how's it feel to be so super terrific, funny, brilliant genius?  Well, you get the same thing, right?  Redress the balance.  Insult me.  The new book, phenomenal, that you did, where you just took your radio show and typed it  out.  I got it for Christmas.  Someone gave it to me.  I didn't even type it out.  I got someone else to.  It's the radio show typed out. 
[00:47:00]  I'm going, why did I fucking think of this?  You wrote a book and you didn't even have to write it.  Sell it to the hardcores.  How great is that?  But you guys ought to think about doing this.  Is it really?  That is a great idea.  In book form?  And the sad thing is it's fucking better than anything we've ever done.  That's the problem.  It's hysterical.  A little gushing coming out of you, you son of a bitch.  You haven't got Kyle Pilkington, the oddest man in the universe.  A man with a head like an orange who says ridiculous things.  We discovered this guy and he just says just, you know, crazy things. 
[00:47:30]  What's the PC term?  Moron.  All right.  That's PC.  Retarded.  Yeah.  Stupid dolt.  All right.  Hey, a few more phones want to get in here.  Jenny from Knoxville, Tennessee.  Jenny, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I just want to tell Ricky he's got the greatest laugh.  It just cracks me up.  And also, I cried like a baby at the end of the Christmas special.  It was really sweet. 
[00:48:00]  Don't ruin it.  We haven't seen it, you bitch.  I haven't seen it yet, you spoiler of everything.  I didn't.  I didn't see it.  Seriously, when he dies, it's amazing.  It's just, oh.  I'll cry in a good way.  That's great.  That's exactly what we want to happen.  People crying.  That's great.  It's easy to make people laugh.  It's harder to make them cry, I think.  I will say.  I couldn't believe it.  I couldn't believe it.  Thank you very much, Jenny.  Thank you.  My girlfriend and I broke up, and I was so depressed, I stayed up all night drinking coffee, and I  watched again the last episode of The Office, and I did blubber. 
[00:48:30]  But it was like a lot about the relationship.  Oh, Jesus.  I was really a fucking Mary, and then we got back together.  Did you tell her what you did when you broke up?  Yeah, of course I did.  And now she can hold that over your head?  And now she just laughs at you?  No, she's crying, baby.  I like the idea you stayed the whole night drinking coffee.  Yeah.  That's going to help you sleep, isn't it?  That's going to help you.  I didn't know what to do.  I don't drink or do drugs anymore, so I had to have some coffee and just watch The Office.  And he probably wanted to stay awake so he could feel the pain.  No, I wanted to sleep, actually.  Did you?  Oh, yeah.  I know nothing, then.  Fuck me.  No, no, no.  I would normally have done that.  Just relive the pain.  Over and over and over. 
[00:49:00]  No, she felt bad at me when I told her.  I was really upset.  I watched The Office and the head went right into the lap, so it was well worth it.  Hey, let's go to Neil in New York.  Neil, what's up?  Yeah, it's an honor, Ricky.  You really remastered the British comedy.  Thank you.  My question is, you just mentioned Carl Pilketon.  How surprised were you by the Ali and Robert Knight phenomenon in the UK?  That was mad.  Yeah, we had this reality show called I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here, and they have  to live in the jungle. 
[00:49:30]  And they do tasks to get meals.  And one of them was eating a kangaroo penis, eating a kangaroo anus, just eating this awful  witchety grubs.  And we were talking about this, and Carl went, yeah, and also they were having that for breakfast.  And he just went, you know, I could eat a knob at night.  And people looped that and made it into all these different dance tracks.  It was like 75 different versions of Carl Pilketon going, I could eat a knob at night, which  is, you know, it's a great thing to dance to, I think. 
[00:50:00]  It's amazing.  Yeah, people pick up the ball, run with it.  We get clips sometimes, and our listeners will just put it to music.  It's great.  People out there, the effort is unbelievable.  One line and just boom.  People put it to music.  Let's go to O-Town Joe in Boston.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Hey, Mr. Bennington, how you doing?  Good, man.  Ricky, with all the actors you had in the first season of The Office, second season of The  Office, were they all famous before, or have they all got success from the show? 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, no, no.  We always choose new people, because I think it suspends your disbelief a little bit more.  So we don't go to other people's little black book.  We cast, and we cast, and we did that with The Office.  We did it with extras.  I mean, apart from the A-listers.  But it's nice to start from scratch, because you're not watching it going, oh, that's so-and-so  from, what's-its-name?  So, no, we always cast.  That kind of sucks.  You never get a fucking call back once you're done with the show with them.  That's it.  It's over, Johnny.  Now the receptionist is on Studio 60, though, and all those people are blowing up. 
[00:51:00]  They're all doing well, right?  Everybody from The Office.  Well, you know, what I do is I take them down, and I release them like little ducklings.  And I can never help them again.  But, you know, my work is done.  You know, you've got a room filled of unknowns right here.  And so it shall remain.  He's typing this into a book right now, selling them on eBay later.  Let's go to John in Philly.  John. 
[00:51:30]  Hey, Ricky.  Hi.  I'm a big fan.  Thank you.  Despite The Office and Extras being brilliant, your iPod, your podcast was absolutely genius.  It's the favorite thing I do.  Honestly.  No effort.  I just sit there.  Carl comes up with everything, and then I just type it out.  I don't even type it out.  We've done that, and I put it into a book.  But it's great because it's, you know, you can say what you want, when you want.  It can be any length, and TV takes, you know, a long, long time.  An episode would take a few months. 
[00:52:00]  So the podcast is so much fun for me.  And I want Carl to become famous because I know he'll hate it.  I want him to be bothered in the street.  I want people to go up to him and say, you've got a head like a fucking orange.  And I want people to squeeze his little head.  Well, that's my question.  Carl makes Homer Simpson look like Stephen Hawking.  Is there any chance that you will tour with Carl?  He won't do it.  I would love to get him on stage, just like in a little cage like The Elephant Man. 
[00:52:30]  That's his favorite film, by the way.  He was talking about The Elephant Man.  You know that bit when Antony Hopkins goes, he takes The Elephant Man out to all the surgeons and goes,  you see the curvature of the spine and the legs and the limbs are.  But ironically, the thing that is untouched, the genitals, they're totally normal.  And Carl went, think of that.  The one thing you would like like an elephant, and he gets the fucking head. 
[00:53:00]  Will the podcast ever come back?  Maybe, yeah.  We're giving it a rest for a while, and you can get the back catalogue on iTunes for a few dollars.  But yeah, we might do another one.  Or if you want, maybe you could type them all out.  Send them to him.  And staple them together.  What about the Bowie song?  The Bowie song should be out by now, from the last actions.  I think that's been on YouTube since it went out in England. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, you mean release it?  Yeah, just release it as a single.  Why not?  Yeah, just get it out there.  Was that weird for you too, that it's Bowie?  I mean, I know that you probably grew up just...  Of course.  Yeah, probably my musical hero for about 25 years.  And to co-write a song with him.  And it's so funny because I was talking on the phone, and I'd sent him the lyrics.  And I said, oh, we want to do this.  We thought something, you know, a bit retro.  Maybe something like Life on Mars, right?  And he went...  Yeah, and he said, oh yeah, I'll just knock off a Life on Mars for you.  I'll just knock off, yeah.  The great thing is it was such a Bowie song. 
[00:54:00]  Like, it really was very hooky.  He knew exactly what he was doing.  He gave us, he gave us, ooh, a Bowie, didn't he?  Yeah, right.  Yeah.  Let's go to Chuck in New Mexico.  Chuck, what's going on today?  Hey, I wanted to ask Ricky about his stand-up stuff.  I had bought a copy of Politics and a copy of Animals on eBay,  then found out that they were just British.  Are they ever from the U.S.?  I had to go out and buy a Modi region DVD player just to watch them.  Yeah, it's...  I bet you don't get all the stuff on there. 
[00:54:30]  Does it translate?  Do you understand what I'm saying?  Probably the regional references don't travel well, do they?  Yeah, there was some of the stuff I kind of didn't get,  but probably 80, 85% of it was translatable.  Oh, that's good news, because I am going to do some gigs.  I want to do a few in New York.  I think I'm playing a few gigs here in May,  so I'll have to find out what travels and what doesn't.  What, are you doing stand-up?  Yeah, well, I'm doing a new tour now in England.  I'm just touring.  It's a new thing called Fame, which I'm going around the country. 
[00:55:00]  Just hand out maps as the placemats in the comedy club,  so you have a reference of a location.  And they could just...  Look down.  Yeah.  New York, England.  On the globe, just two stars.  I'll fly between them.  No, I would love to do stand-up in New York.  Yeah.  It's so romantic, I think, about doing stand-up in New York.  Yeah, just ask Jimmy.  He'll tell you.  Oh, every night.  Oh, yeah.  The romance comes afterwards.  Is it true you've got, like, seven minutes?  You just do...  New York stand-up start to do seven minutes. 
[00:55:30]  We do...  No, on the road, you do, you know, 45 to an hour,  but in New York, usually the comedy show, you do 20-minute sets.  Sometimes on the city, there's 10 minutes.  That's the same.  Yeah, it's the shorter sets.  I know there are, like, junglers and their comedy store in England  are pretty famous, but I never worked in England, though.  Right, okay.  A lot of it is quite, sort of, hack stuff.  When you do, sort of, think of places like junglers,  it's people going out, and they start off with things like,  yeah, you know when you get stoned, you get the munchies,  and all this stuff, you know, like, oh, yeah.  Difference between cats and dogs and men and women,  and don't old people drive slow. 
[00:56:00]  Jimmy's working on an HBO special.  Sorry, I...  Oh, really?  I want to do one of those as well.  Yeah, it's an hour.  Shooting, I think, in April.  And do you shoot it...  Talk amongst yourselves, sorry.  Sure.  And do you shoot it as live, or is it like a TV show where you...  Carlin, well, I mean, in front of an audience,  yeah, but Carlin does them live.  I don't have...  They don't give me that option.  I'll shoot it, probably, and it will go...  I think it's, like, 10-camera shoot,  and they'll just edit it, cut it down to 56 minutes or whatever,  like, in real time, like Carlin does.  And then that plays...  Then that material's redundant, though, isn't it?  Dead, yeah.  Yeah, so... 
[00:56:30]  Once I put it on DVD or do it on TV, that's dead.  You've got to start again.  But you think some people in England,  they survive on 40 minutes for about 25 years.  Oh, same here, Tom.  We got that.  We got that.  Kevin Meaney.  I'll give you that name.  Oh, boy.  Kevin Meaney.  Not big-pants people.  Been doing the same act for years.  You're going to put an eye out.  We'll lose the house, goddammit.  Once it's on TV, though, it's hard.  He can't do that anymore now.  Nah.  Let's do his whole act now.  I don't know him, but... 
[00:57:00]  He's almost your extras character,  when you really think about it.  That's almost Kevin Meaney,  without even meaning to do it.  He does a We Are The World bit still.  He does a We Are The World thing,  where the music comes on...  No joke.  ...and he does every character  from the We Are The World thing.  He, like, does a mime act,  where he does facial expressions  and lets the song play.  It's We Are The World.  It's a 25-year-old song.  It was topical for the first year,  and then 24 years after that...  I don't know this guy,  but I'm feeling sorry for it.  I've been gated. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, you should.  And the audience.  You should feel sorry for the audience,  is right.  This isn't libelous yet, is it?  No.  We haven't said that this is all...  No.  It's all your own opinion.  It's all fair comment.  Okay, fine.  Let's go to John in Ohio.  You just got to hop on a plane,  and you're fine anyway.  John in Ohio.  John.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hello.  We'll clean up.  Ricky, love your work.  I've got a question for you, boys.  Is there any way that you can get Ricky  to recite some of Steve C.'s bad acting?  Oh, boy.  Oh, God.  I don't know if we have time.  Steve Carlesi is our production guy. 
[00:58:00]  Occasionally him and that gentleman, Bill,  that lunatic Charles Manson-looking guy right there.  Harry Kane Stanton.  Speaking of offices,  voted most likely to kill us someday.  To kill everybody in here, yeah.  To go postal.  He's the guy.  He's the number one on the list.  He comes up with these sketches and scripts  that he shows us,  and they go into production  and hammer him out,  and we play him,  and Steve, our production guy,  the guy that puts these things together,  he acted in one of them,  and I use that term so loosely, 
[00:58:30]  I don't even want to come up  with some kind of loose analogy.  It is completely...  Here comes Steve now.  Hi, Steve.  Hello.  How are you, Steve?  And his acting is just second to nine.  If you're going to cast something in the future,  consider Steve if you need somebody  who can deliver lines like this.  Here's a couple of lines.  The first one I'll play  is just a simple why not.  It's just why not.  The second one is him asking somebody  how did their parents die?  This is a very serious question. 
[00:59:00]  Very emotional.  Let's listen to these next to each other,  shall we?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  The emotional reign is just fantastic.  That's amazing.  It really is.  And then when he's telling him  how his parents died,  here's his response.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Isn't it great?  I'm going to laugh  the way they set you up there. 
[00:59:30]  Someone's in the house, Steve.  Someone's in the house.  What are you doing in my house?  That's all right.  And then he tells them,  but listen to this sing-song bullshit.  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  What is...  Your head should pop out  of a fucking laughing box  when you deliver that.  Get the fuck out.  Now.  That's anger.  That's anger.  And this is the only emotion he shows.  Get the fuck out.  Now.  Yeah, like his teeth are clenched.  And here is my favorite.  This is, 
[01:00:00]  he's handling the situation.  The girl, wife,  comes in.  And he's got to tell her now  that he'll handle the situation.  And you could almost see him.  Eyes half shut.  That,  that hand kind of waving her out  as he delivers this.  No.  Nothing's wrong.  Just stay in the living room.  I'll handle it.  Nice stuff.  It's a burglar.  Oh, he's openly laughing at you.  These are the best acted lines 
[01:00:30]  I've ever seen.  You could play the part of a guy  who lost his adrenal gland  that for whatever reason  he cannot.  He can't get any type of energy  or emotion.  The house is on fire.  I'm thinking either  a lot of shock therapy,  a lobotomy victim perhaps,  something like that.  I like,  I like that as a,  an illness.  I lost my adrenal gland.  Where'd you have it last?  I was,  it was,  I was,  I had it in the car  and I was getting excited  about stuff  and I,  I looked under the seat  and now I don't care 
[01:01:00]  about anything.  There's a nail in my balls.  Pull this nail  out of my balls.  It could be a character.  It could work.  He is talented at the,  the no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no thing  because he does,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no.  That was actually him doing,  saying no as he's very excited.  That was right as he lost  his adrenal gland.  He had the last bit of emotion.  No,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no, 
[01:01:30]  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  some of the battery's dead.  Oh,  it started.  Sim 2.  I just love this hill of gunfire I walk into.  Yeah.  Well,  whenever we have actors come in,  we love to showcase our own actor,  Steve Carleese.  Yeah.  Isn't he wonderful?  I didn't think it was that bad.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  I think you'd get away with that.  You'd get away with that on an awful lot of television programs.  Or a lot of awful television programs.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Same thing.  Oh,  good.  I,  I think you're probably around the, 
[01:02:00]  around the average there.  Wow.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Well,  your first compliment.  I see about a hundred people to get one good actor.  So,  uh,  and many of them,  many of them are much worse than that.  Some of them are millionaires and are much worse than that.  Absolutely.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Second career.  Wow.  It's because people can survive with like soap operas now.  You're in my fucking casting room.  That's what they all say to him.  Get the fuck out.  Too much emotion.  Yeah. 
[01:02:30]  It was way over the top.  And let's do that.  Let's redo that.  We've had,  uh,  Frank Vincent did his lines.  Oh,  yeah.  Who else did him?  Brian Cox.  Do you know Brian Cox?  Uh,  yeah.  The,  the,  uh,  old English actor.  Fat.  Yeah,  he's fat from,  uh,  yeah.  Fat guy.  Fat guy.  Fat guy.  Fat guy.  Fat guy.  Fat guy.  Fat guy.  Fat guy.  Fat guy.  Fat guy.  Fat guy.  Fat guy.  Fat guy.  Fat guy.  Fat guy.  Fat guy.  Fat guy.  Fat guy.  Fat guy.  Fat guy.  Of course,  yeah.  Very good.  Then Ricky,  you did the last Christopher Guest film,  which had to be really cool,  right?  It was great fun because,  um,  uh,  I'm a massive Spinal Tap fan.  Sure.  Oh,  yeah.  And I,  I think,  uh,  I,  I,  I stole everything he did, 
[01:03:00]  really.  I think,  you know,  direct influence on The Office and that,  that sort of.  But they,  they just tell you that improv wants you to show up.  Absolutely.  Yeah,  it's scary.  I,  I spoke to,  um,  Larry David and he showed me the script for Curb.  Right.  And it's,  um,  there's about 30 pages and all the jokes there.  Christopher Guest,  five pages for the,  like the whole film.  And they come in and go,  um,  you might want to mention dinner.  And that's it.  And you go for like seven minutes and you do it,  three times and it's totally different every time.  And everyone's,  um, 
[01:03:30]  totally improv and so,  uh,  yeah,  it,  it,  it,  it,  it,  it was,  um,  that was a lot of fun.  The Larry David interview that you did that didn't show in the States.  It was.  No,  I did Larry David,  Chris Guest and,  um,  Gary Shandling and they,  uh,  they,  uh,  but I think HBO might,  um,  put them out.  This is a grass.  I only saw the Larry David,  but it's amazing.  It's so much fun to meet Larry David.  He was just such a gentleman,  you know what I mean?  It's just,  uh,  cause you've got this image of people and of course everyone's guilty.  I wonder if he's like the Larry David on Caribbean enthusiasm.  Right.  Of course he's not. 
[01:04:00]  He's,  he's a lovely,  sweet,  you know,  guy,  but,  um,  uh,  he was,  um,  it was,  it was,  it was like meeting,  meeting an icon really.  Right.  Even though,  you know,  he didn't really know who he was in Seinfeld until,  but it's like meeting Woody Allen or something.  It was,  it was absolute pleasure.  I always love it.  Like when people I dig love other people that I dig.  That's always my favorite thing in life.  I'm like,  okay,  there's something that works in the universe.  Yeah.  But you liked it as much if I'd have said,  oh,  he's such an asshole.  Yeah,  sure. 
[01:04:30]  I agree.  Fuck him.  I don't like him that much.  What the hell?  Let's go to Larry in Huntington.  Larry,  what's up?  Good God,  guys.  Five brilliant comedians in one room.  What a show.  Wow.  Hey,  thank you very much.  Is anybody living in the last day?  No,  that's good.  Was that,  was that true?  You got the pause.  Was that truthful?  It certainly was guys.  I love you guys.  All five of you.  Thank you,  sir.  I'm,  I'm two of them.  Larry. 
[01:05:00]  Hey,  Ricky,  I just have a question.  I was just wondering,  um,  what might you and Steve Merchant be working on after extras is over?  Uh,  um,  we are doing something else.  It's probably going to be a bit more of a,  a comedy drama thing.  It's called,  um,  uh,  men at the Prue.  And the Prue is,  uh,  is a big building society in England called the Prudential.  And,  um,  sort of traditionally that was the office job you,  you went to,  uh,  if you'd left,  you know,  school and you had some qualifications,  you went into,  you know, 
[01:05:30]  into that as a step up.  And they,  they,  uh,  they gave jobs for thousands of people in each country.  And it's going to be set in like 1970,  uh,  in a sort of seaside town.  And it's,  um,  a place where the sexual revolution didn't hit.  And it's just these 20 somethings just,  um,  just sort of caught in limbo.  It's sort of,  uh,  um,  sort of Billy Lyre-ish meets Dinah.  Um,  and,  and that's,  uh,  and that's what we're working on.  I say all that.  We've written about three lines.  We get the mood first.  We get the mood first. 
[01:06:00]  And all the references we don't understand in the States.  It's another one like that.  Maybe,  yeah.  Billy Lyre is a big British film,  but you probably,  you know Dinah though.  Right.  Yeah.  But,  uh,  that's why I love the guy from the EastEnders on your show who I know nothing about,  but he's in every episode.  And it's just terrible.  Oh,  Barry from EastEnders,  of course.  Yes.  Yeah.  Well,  but you get the idea.  Screech.  Over here,  he would be Screech,  I think for us.  Oh,  is that,  is that the guy who talks?  Yeah.  What was Screech?  Yeah.  Saved by the bell,  which was,  didn't get that.  We didn't get that.  You're lucky.  Is it a bad broad? 
[01:06:30]  And can I point out,  when that guy said five brilliant comedians in the room,  every one of us did a quick count to make sure.  Definitely,  yeah.  We weren't about to be shit on them.  Exactly,  yeah.  If there's six,  who's not included?  Let's go to Carol in Ohio.  Carol.  Oh,  hey there.  How are you doing today?  Oh,  we're doing good today.  Well,  you guys do good every day.  A real honor here to talk to Mr.  Gervais.  Thank you.  I happened to see, 
[01:07:00]  I happened to see your interview with Parkey.  Oh,  yeah.  Yeah,  when you were talking about some reporter after you got successful,  asked you what three things you'd save.  From a burning flat.  That's right,  yeah.  I said my cat,  my salamander,  and one of the twins.  And they pretty much just thought I was serious.  They just thought,  yeah.  I know,  I know it.  It was so funny.  And,  oh,  I love Barry from EastEnders being on the show. 
[01:07:30]  You get,  I mean,  you're brilliant.  What can I say?  Oh,  she's gushing.  Thank you very much.  Hey,  man,  I'm not gushing.  I'm just telling the truth.  Nothing wrong with the little ass kids.  Keep it together,  please.  American chicks just throwing themselves at English guys.  I love the office.  Thank you very much.  He was so painfully painful to watch.  I mean,  that was the idea.  I can,  I can hand it out.  I like,  I get embarrassed when I see reality shows on TV when someone totally embarrassed themselves. 
[01:08:00]  The worst thing is that we have these reality game shows flirting.  Of someone flirting with someone.  It's,  why is it so excruciating?  And just crashing and burning.  It's just,  it's just awful the things they say.  And they say it quietly.  Like,  we can't hear.  Well,  no,  it's 30 cameras.  It's like,  no,  don't do that.  Yeah.  Just good,  good natured ribbing is another one that makes you want to throw up when you,  like when you walk in the room,  the guy that will go,  there he is.  Some revelry is about to begin,  huh? 
[01:08:30]  I love that.  There's something about that whole being uncomfortable thing.  That could either be excruciating where you don't want to be part of it or,  you know,  addicting where you like the office where you have to watch it.  Did you ever see,  um,  uh,  Lisa Kudrow's show?  Oh,  I saw,  I saw a couple.  I really enjoyed it.  The comeback.  Yeah.  I loved it.  It was fantastic.  I thought it was great.  It was so uncomfortable to watch her.  And she was great.  Yeah.  So different.  Did,  did people sort of want Phoebe when it,  when it came down to it?  Yeah.  Probably. 
[01:09:00]  I know.  Morons.  I know.  It was so uncomfortable to watch her,  like think she was in a better place than she was,  but actually kind of realize,  you know,  in her alone moments,  she kind of.  It's great.  Yeah.  Really.  To that reality.  But then when she's around people trying to be happy and.  Oh,  it was hard to watch.  Audacious as well,  because they kept,  you know,  uncovering layers of it.  Yeah.  Her relationship with the writers was just awful.  Really great.  Well,  Larry Sanders sort of,  you know,  nailed it as well.  Just absolutely brilliant.  But I don't just like those, 
[01:09:30]  you know,  I suppose,  you know,  cutting edge.  And I,  I like my favorite show at the moment is heroes.  I cannot get enough of it.  I just,  I absolutely love it.  We're just making fun of heroes,  right?  Yeah.  We're just making fun of it.  But no,  of course you,  and you should,  but you should,  because it's,  it's fun.  But I love these,  we were asking Carl Pilkington,  if he had a superpower,  what would he have?  And we,  it was going,  oh,  I wouldn't like that.  I was going,  no,  if you can't,  he went,  no,  it's too much responsibility.  I go,  no,  it's just fancy.  What would you have? 
[01:10:00]  He went,  I know,  yeah,  choosing none.  He went,  oh,  I don't know,  invisible then.  I went,  and what would you do with it?  He went,  he chose to get it,  if he's invisible,  he would go to Tower Records,  right?  And just hide,  right?  Until it was shut.  And then he could shop in peace.  So he wasn't even stealing them.  He was just shopping in peace.  That was his superpower,  to be able to shop for records in peace.  But if he's invisible,  why not just shop and everybody's there?  What's the matter with this guy?  Yeah,  well,  it's probably crowded.  All right. 
[01:10:30]  You know,  you can still bump into them when you're visible.  It's quiet.  Or just wait until they shut down like they did,  and fucking just go to the dumpster and steal everything.  Poor cocksuckers are out of business.  That's got to be live with us.  Yeah,  it is.  That would cross the line.  Yeah,  now you're in trouble.  Tower Records,  Sue,  we are not cocksuckers.  Right.  The last thing they do is,  Sue,  that's the last piece of business they have.  All right,  let's go to Paul in Boston here.  Hey,  Paul,  what's up?  Hey,  I just,  I've never heard a show as funny as today. 
[01:11:00]  You guys are so rocking,  man.  So what's the difference today?  Oh,  let's have a look.  Whoa,  let's have a look.  I came in early,  so that helps.  I mean,  that's an extra.  Yeah,  he's different today.  Seriously,  I'm going to start coming in all the time like this.  This is great,  hanging out with you guys.  Don't you have a show to do right now?  Fuck that show.  Aren't you on the air like,  I don't care about this show.  You do a morning show,  a midday show,  an afternoon show?  I do a couple of shows.  Hold on.  Are you on air at the same time as this?  He's on the air.  Like,  right after us, 
[01:11:30]  he'll come on at noon.  Sorry,  this is two radio stations.  At least.  It's actually 162.  Yeah.  Oh,  you've got loads in here.  Oh,  it's just.  So you've just crashed another radio station?  Yeah,  because there's nothing happening for me.  You're welcome.  Yeah.  It's you.  Yeah.  It's you.  But he goes and then does regular FM radio at what time?  Six o'clock.  Six o'clock.  Yeah.  And regular FM,  is that like,  just like we have?  Got to pay attention to the rules.  Right.  Yeah.  Broadcast.  Broadcast radio.  Kind of non-funny.  Just everything here, 
[01:12:00]  but taken out.  But take the humor out.  But this is across America,  isn't it?  Of course.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But the FM radio.  I'm just trying to work out if he's got more viewers,  because I might go with him.  Oh,  well,  viewers in radio,  that's a rough one.  We have seven or eight right now.  Doing well.  Yeah.  Well,  you're actually.  Seven share.  I love watching those guys.  I turn it down.  I just love watching them.  You're on camera,  actually.  The Pal Talk.  We are broadcasting on the net,  too.  They just watch us,  and we watch them.  A lot of the times, 
[01:12:30]  the girls will flash us,  so you are being seen.  Yeah.  A little bit,  yeah.  Well,  we should get Ricky out of here.  A couple hundred.  We've been talking over an hour here.  It's been great fun.  Thank you so much.  My pleasure.  Anytime you're back around.  What's the big plug there, Ricky?  Extras season two,  of course.  On HBO.  Sunday night.  Premier Sundays,  yeah,  and then throughout the week.  Hope you're not afraid to take some pictures.  Let's take some pictures.  Because Jimmy Norton will cost you.  He is known as one of these guys who,  if he doesn't get a picture,  like he loves you.  If something happened where you had to go. 
[01:13:00]  That's a good thing,  though.  Yeah,  but if something happened where you had to go,  look,  I'm sorry,  I would love to,  but I gotta go,  and went to that elevator and didn't take a picture,  he would sit down and go,  that fucking scumbag is the worst piece of shit.  A picture.  Not true.  True.  I'll say that regardless.  No,  I wouldn't say that because he was great to hang out with.  The only guy I've ever said that about was Gene Simmons from Kiss,  because he was conting to me after we interviewed him.  But no,  I mean,  it's Derek Jeter.  Derek Jeter.  Derek Jeter.  And Randy Johnson.  Randy Johnson. 
[01:13:30]  Let's keep going for the Yankees.  De Niro turned me down.  De Niro turned me down,  but he was pleasant about it,  so I never bet him.  Billy Crystal.  Billy Crystal was a douche.  We had the same manager.  We had the same manager.  See,  all of a sudden,  there's a few more people.  Mother Teresa,  you called a current.  Right.  I remember that.  That was all.  She was a bit too good.  I didn't believe it.  There's somewhat going on there.  Too good.  She was too good.  Yeah,  what's she after?  She was making up for something.  What is she after?  And you never saw her with a guy.  Same as that Gandhi.  Right.  Both of them. 
[01:14:00]  Making up for something.  She wasn't a cunt.  She was a cocktease.  There's a big difference.  Fucking hell.  Liabulous.  Catholic Church.  Jesus Christ.  Ricky's loving that.  Yeah.  Amazing.  I can never badmouth that music.  Fucking brilliantly funny.  I had a great time.  One of my favorite characters ever.  It was Hawkeye Pierce  and Louis De Palma,  I thought were the two best.  All right,  you want to see Archie Bunker,  but he's got to be  in the top three or four  sitcom characters ever.  Way to judge.  That's great.  He goes from like  a scary cellmate  to a really nice artist. 
[01:14:30]  I like this.  Yeah,  you should know half  the things we know about him.  All right.  You to run.  We should go take some pictures, huh?  Yes.  Thank you so much.  I'm going to do pictures.  Fuck you.  Grab him.  All right,  we'll be back in just a bit.  So what becomes of you,  my love?  When they have finally stripped you off?  The handbags and the glad racks  That you're crowned 
[01:15:00]  That has to sweat  So you goodbye  It's the best  of the worst  of the comics  on the O.B. and Anthony show.  It's the best  Boo!  The best  of the worst  of the comedians  of the O.B. and Anthony show.  Just hilarious.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Really funny.  Really awful, too, 
[01:15:30]  by the way.  I'll acknowledge that.  Holy mother of God.  Now presenting comedian  Jim Brewer.  Anthony,  the Razor Rollerboard Scooter.  These damn things  are all over Manhattan.  It's the hottest product  this summer.  You probably have seen them  by now.  I defy anybody  to say they have not  seen one of these.  They are very popular  with kids,  teens,  college students,  even people commuting  on these things, O.B.  They're pretty cool.  And I know these guys  that had these little  hop-up kits for them.  So you could hop it up 
[01:16:00]  so it'll go fast enough  to really get dangerous.  Sleek looking.  Souping it up.  And just a piecer to ride.  Get the hell out of here  with that thing now!  Christ!  Visit one of their stores  or go online.  He's bringing back a memory.  If you live on Long Island,  man,  every neighborhood  had the kid.  Had the kid  with the stupid  moped or the motor 
[01:16:30]  or the minibike.  Yeah,  with dad raking,  he'd be like,  me, me, me.  Ah, slow down!  Now, Jerry,  I'm sorry.  God damn it.  All day.  Long Island memories, man.  He was also the guy  that would stop  like in the middle  while you're playing  a stickball game.  Yeah.  And he'd get off the bike  and he'd go,  oh no, 
[01:17:00]  it's the moped guy  get off his bike.  Give me the bat,  faggot.  You hear that cigarette  dangling from his mouth?  Pitch the ball,  faggot,  pitch it.  Take a swing.  And he would look  horrible swinging.  Pitch it good  before I kick your ass.  This game is for fairies.  He'd always have a dribble  of snot in his nose  but he couldn't say nothing  because he was too tough.  Because he'd beat you up. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  That's funny.  Another Long Island memory.  Thank you, Jim.  Two brothers in jail.  The Razor Rollerboard Scooter.  Give him a call  or go online.  The Razor Rollerboard Scooter.  If you want to drive your dogs  at Complete and Saturday,  go to Razor.  I can't listen. 
[01:18:00]  Knock it off.  Get inside.  Get inside.  If you come down here  with that goddamn scooter  one more time,  I'm calling the cops.  My God. 
[01:18:30]  Get inside.  Get inside.  God damn it.  He's gonna give my  goddamn...  God damn it.  He's gonna give them  a goddamn hot attack.  Call the cops, Henry.  Call the cops.  I'm calling the cops,  you son of a bitch.  All right.  Calm down, Chester.  Calm down.

[01:20:00]  He's gonna die.  Call the goddamn police now.  He doesn't even live here.  I want him arrested.  This is ridiculous.  He doesn't even have a license.  Henry's left the studio.  Come back.  Oh, my God.  You're killing me.  You are effing killing me.  Mike, what's going on?  Oh, my God.  I can't believe this. 
[01:20:30]  I gotta run to the bathroom.  This guy's amazing.  Brewer's hilarious.  He's hilarious.  You're the man, Brewer.  God bless.  God bless all of you.  All right, my God.  I can't friggin' breathe, okay?  My Brewer is spitting up.  Oh, my God.  You gotta do that on stage.  Yeah, that's great.  The visual's even better, man.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  The goddamn... 
[01:21:00]  What the hell is going on?  The goddamn animal from across the way.  His mother don't give two crap because she's never around.  He's got that brand new scooter for...  Christ.  Knock it off.  Knock it off.  Our dog's name was Mookie.  Mookie.  Mookie.  You are a Met fan.  Knock it off.  Mookie.  Knock it off. 
[01:21:30]  Goddamn.  That is classic.  That and the same time with the...  You get the same result from fireworks.  Remember fireworks?  Yeah.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  I'm calling the cops, goddamn it, on each and every one of you.  My dog has been under the goddamn bed for three hours now and I can give him a heart attack. 
[01:22:00]  What's the roof, you son of a bitch?  If my roof goes on fire, do you understand me?  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  That's Long Island, though, man.  That's Long Island.  Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.  It all...  In all those neighborhoods, they'd have their own fireworks display right in the middle of the street.  Yeah.  And the poor one dog...  The scream...  The screaming old lady, though. 
[01:22:30]  Everyone had him.  One family left that one dog alone.  You are killing me with the dog, the joke collar.  That's all it sounds like.  Chris, what's going on?  Have some water.  Dude, you've got to get him out of there.  I'm standing in the middle of the street laughing my effing figs off.  I'm going to get crazy screams in my minivan. 
[01:23:00]  Well, he's puking right now from playing the dog.  Oh, man, I can't even breathe.  What are we in the middle of?  The Razor Rollerboard Scooter.  I totally forgot.  It's the Razor Rollerboard Scooter.  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:23:30]  Hello.  Good afternoon.  Who are you?  Just a friendly little nigger.  What?  That's right.  I said it.  Jesus.  Hey, listen.  If we're going to get crazy, let's do it, Hammer.  Ouch.  Who are you?  We haven't seen you in so long.  We don't know who you are.  I was on the witness protection program.  Were you?  Yeah, but now I'm back.  All right.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027. 
[01:24:00]  Not one phone ringing in New York yet.  So come on.  Give us a call.  Anywhere else outside of New York, you could use 866-277-4WOW.  In studio today.  Jim Brewer!  I remember about, it has to be close to a year ago, I said, ah, dudes, I've got to  go away for a while.  My wife's having a kid.  I'll see you in a few months.  Your kid's got to be like five now.  I almost went AWOL, man. 
[01:24:30]  I couldn't come up here.  I was too angry.  Too angry?  Yes.  There should be a, I'm not going to condone what that lady did, but I'll tell you what,  man.  I understand.  I understand.  DK, I almost went Norton on D a couple times.  I almost went Norton on her a couple times.  Really?  I can't even tell you.  I wanted to blow up the car.  I threatened her.  I just wanted to leave.  I couldn't come up here.  That bad?  I'm trembling right now.  Give me a second to think.  What was the problem, though? 
[01:25:00]  Bad labor?  Dude, no.  I'm just, I haven't been out in a long time, so.  All right.  You need anything?  You need a little, you know, it just feels good.  We're going to have, I can use it.  Where's Stinky at?  Oh, yeah.  Well, Stinky has a new name.  What is it?  No longer Stinky.  Awesome Garrett.  Awesome Garrett.  Awesome Garrett.  Because he's an awesome Garrett.  Because our Garrett is an awesome Garrett.  You ever hear a.  You want to say hi to Awesome Garrett?  I have a kid and there's a song.  Our God is an awesome God.  You never heard that?  Our God is an awesome God. 
[01:25:30]  He does things and he's a God.  Hey, Awesome Garrett.  Our Garrett is an awesome Garrett.  It's Awesome Garrett.  Garrett.  How cool is it for Awesome Garrett that now, like, the stinky thing can go away and you're  Awesome Garrett?  Thank God.  Is it awesome?  It's awesome.  It's Awesome Garrett.  But it's still Club Stinky.  Oh, definitely.  Can't be Club Awesome under new management.  I'm the only thing that's awesome. 
[01:26:00]  Right.  Awesome Garrett.  Our Garrett's an awesome Garrett.  Is this something Awesome Garrett came up with?  No, this is just something that kind of happened.  I think Norton came up with it.  And then the listeners seem to be backing this new name.  This changing name.  You know how they just threw away New Coke?  They took New Coke and didn't like it.  And the consumer, and no matter how much they tried to push it, it didn't work.  Awesome Garrett.  The public is accepting it.  They're moving on from stinky.  Thank God.  Awesome Garrett. 
[01:26:30]  He's going to have a theme song and everything soon.  Our Garrett is an awesome Garrett.  Has nice abs and tussleable hair.  Are you getting a mullet?  Look at his hair.  Definitely.  Yeah.  Ready to go to Babylon.  He's going to be part of mullet of the day.  All right, awesome Garrett.  Awesome Garrett.  There he is.  Call him up.  You could talk to him on the phone.  There's awesome Garrett.  He looked like that kid was afraid to come up to the fast pitcher when he came in here. 
[01:27:00]  Didn't he?  Yeah, he just kind of walks up.  What's happening?  What's going on?  What?  I'm awesome Garrett.  What's wrong, Jim?  That's awesome Garrett.  I'm awesome.  Is the high still the same?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  That didn't change.  Then it's still stinky.  Stinky.  It'll be a little harder for some people to change.  Stinky.  Stinky. 
[01:27:30]  All right.  We're going to have a lot of fun today.  We've been having a blast, bro, in here.  Very good.  And we missed you.  God damn it.  I missed you guys.  I need some giggles.  I feel good.  Yeah.  Well, we got lots of giggles today.  We have fun from the Iron Sheik.  Nice.  From yesterday.  Right in front of me.  We had the Iron Sheik in here yesterday.  Let's play this.  And it was a lot of fun.  But he went inside, as do many of the people that appear on this show, to do a little promo  thing for us.  You know how they say, hey, it's blah, blah, blah, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony. 
[01:28:00]  And then we play it in and out of commercials.  Hey, Ben, why don't you give us an example?  Give us a good example of somebody that's done...  Has done it the right way.  The right way.  Is he a big dude?  Oh, God damn, yeah.  I wouldn't mess with him, man.  Really?  He's big.  He's old big.  You know those big old guys?  Yeah.  Solid.  Barrel.  Barrel.  Barrel.  Barrel.  Very good.  You need, like, four guys.  Hey, Terran Aran.  Greco Roman Wrestling. 
[01:28:30]  Greco Roman.  Greco Roman.  Yeah, just give us one where the guy just did it normally.  Oldest country in the world of Terran Aran.  I'm from Terran Aran.  Oldest country in the Greco Roman Wrestling.  All right, so you guys have heard these things.  You know, we have a lot of these celebrities on the show.  Brewer's done it.  Yeah, you just come on and say, hey.  Hey.  Like, here's Ted Nugent helping us out.  Hey.  Working hard, playing hard, America.  This is your blood brother of all things Sonic Bombast, Ted Nugent.  And you're listening to Opie and Anthony, my blood brothers of rock and roll. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, there you go.  There you go.  Easy.  And even that is, like, long, but he did well with it because he has a lot of personnel.  Even the you-know-what can manage that.  Probably took him one take.  One take.  Steve from foundrymusic.com is in the studio.  And, Steve, what happened after the interview yesterday?  Well, it was actually before the interview.  I got introduced to the Iron Sheik by Rick, and immediately I knew that this was going  to be a long recording session because the guy was having trouble with hello. 
[01:29:30]  And we even have a script for you dicks.  It just says, hey, it's, put your name here, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  That's all you have to really do.  Right.  And it's written right up in my studio.  And I told him, basically, as long as your name and Opie and Anthony is in it, go nuts,  have fun.  It can be whatever you want to be.  Right.  And he launches into this.  Really long wrestling.  Maybe he's retarded, man. 
[01:30:00]  You know?  Well, maybe.  You never know.  Nobody knows that the Sheik man's really retarded.  He's obviously retarded.  He took a lot of hair shots up.  The Sheik man is retarded.  Just teach him to say this.  Go.  All right.  So we have tape of Steve working it with the Iron Sheik here, trying to get something  going on.  Oh, it's painful.  It gets funnier and funnier.  This is about four minutes long.  Basically, it's whatever you want to say.  Whatever you want to say.  As long as you, your name, and Opie and Anthony is in it.  Right.  Whatever you want to say.  Okay.  Yeah, just do a few seconds. 
[01:30:30]  You tell me when I go.  This is the Iron Sheik, the World Wrestling Federation champion.  Pleasure for me to the Anthony and Opie.  They bring me to the WNEW.

No.  Now, all Steve wants, and you can tell every time Steve asks him, is just say, hey, it's  the Iron Sheik, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  That's all we need.  That's all you want it.  Right.  So listen, Steve again will try to make him say it.  And he just goes off on a tear.  Sheik.  Here we go.  And he says pretty much the same exact thing.  Same thing every time.  Good.  But it peaked out a little.

[01:34:00]  One more take.  So now Steve.  All Steve wants, get brewers.  You can do this, there's one more hammer, it's all you.  All Steve wants is his name, and he's listening to Opie and Anthony.  And, you know, any little, like, look, Brewer will inject a little of his personality.  Here's Brewer doing one for us.  It is Jim Brewer.  Ah, yeah!  The air is about to rock!  Fah!  You listen to Opie and Anthony. 
[01:34:30]  See?  But it's good.  There you go.  A little personality, you've got the name and the chick.  That's all we care about.  The name, who you are, a little bit about what you're about there, and then Opie and Anthony.  That's all.  All right, so Steve again tries to convey to the chic, this is what he wants, and listen  to what we got.  Right.  Good.  You want to do a short one?

[01:41:00]  the camel toe and the woman, great thing.  I ride the flying carpet in the sand.  We hate America.  Did I say that?  Uh-oh.  Someone is requesting something else here.  Bob, what's going on?  Yeah, hey guys, how you doing?  All right.  Anthony, I hope you're okay.  It's a pleasure to talk to you, too, Opium.  Opium.  Listen.  Opium.  You're the new name right there.  When it comes to reciting the call letters to N.E.W., Superfly Jimmy Snooker can't fill 
[01:41:30]  the pointed, curly-toed shoes of the Iron Sheik.  I don't know.  I think the Iron Sheik has surpassed the...  It is a completely different animal you're talking about.  The Iron Sheik was on speed, if you want to relate it to drugs.  He is on major amphetamines while Jimmy Superfly Snooker was dead.  God bless him and that big, bull head of his.  All right.  That's what Bob says.  Thank you, Bob.  Doesn't he have a big, fat, meat head?  His head was huge with that Greco-Roman mustache he had on it. 
[01:42:00]  Pleasure for me to Greco-Roman Champlin.  We've got to play the Superfly now.  Yeah, yeah.  The Superfly?  Oh, Jimmy Superfly Snooker.  You've never heard of the Jimmy Superfly Snooker ID?  No.  Which, after just listening to the Iron Sheik, it's like slamming on the brakes.  Sheik's at return.  Scooby.  Listen to this.  Same thing.  Steve had Jimmy Superfly Snooker just...  He wanted him to just say, Opie and Anthony, Jimmy Superfly.  Jimmy Superfly Snooker.  Listen to this. 
[01:42:30]  Okay.  Opie and Anthony.  On 1...  2.7.  On 0.2.  Opie and Anthony on 1.0.2.7.  This is the Superfly Jimmy Snooker, and you are...  Okay, let me start.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  This is Superfly Jimmy Snooker, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony on 1.0.2.7. 
[01:43:00]  On W-N-E-W.  Right again, 1.0.2.7?  Oh, second mark.  1.0.2...  1.0.2.7.  Oh, God.  Is that it?  Yeah.  We call it 1.0.2.7.  Okay.  1.0.2.7.  On W-N-E-W.  Show business.  Adely raped that dude.  You want to say anything?  Hey, this is Jimmy Superfly Snooker.  One more time, and I'll edit that in. 
[01:43:30]  It's the Superfly Jimmy Snooker, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony on 1.0.2.7 W-N-E-W.  Superfly Jimmy Snooker on your radio doll.  Thanks, man.  Okay, brother.  Okay, brother.  Okay, brother.  Jimmy Superfly Snooker on your radio doll.  I think Iron Sheik beat him.  Show business is rude, bro. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, well, you know, it just goes to show you.  Watch what he does for money.  Slam your head harder.  He calls himself the Sheik.  We're making a killing on his doll.  Can he talk?  Well, check this out.  Especially back in the old days of professional wrestling like that.  You know, I don't know what kind of deals the guys are making now,  but I would assume they're still not very secure when they get let go.  And they just make the rounds like he's doing some comic book show.  It's not like the old days where he would go in waving the Iranian flag back in 1990. 
[01:44:30]  It's the dream, Dusty Rhodes, man.  Oh, God.  We're Sergeant Slaughtered being there.  Big match.  Thousands of fans screaming.  Now he's like, hello, big comic book show.  Pleasure to be.  Signed, comic book magazine for Americans.  Pleasure to.  All right, just sign it.  Let me move on here, Sheik.  I got Knight Rider down the way here.  I got to have a David Hasselhoff sign.  I got to go pick up the ads.  Right.  You're holding me up Gidget's sign in my friggin' comic book. 
[01:45:00]  You probably made him somewhere.  A little 19-year-old heroin addict.  I just want to be a wrestler.  Built him.  Come with me.  Ah!  Great.  Keith?  Keith has a good story.  Keith.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Pleasure to talk to you.  Pleasure to talk to you.  We were hanging out.  One of my buddies is an independent wrestler.  After the show one night, we're hanging out in the bar.  He keeps the bar open until 4 o'clock by signing autographs for people.  And then he decides to go back to the room.  We're drinking Heineken's.  I called the guy, Jabroni, screwing around with him, and he chokeslammed me on his bed. 
[01:45:30]  On his bed?  Ooh.  Hold me down and won't let me get up.  My buddy's cheering him on.  He's insane.  The guy is literally insane.  Pleasure to be raping you.  All right.  Come on, Box.  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  Brewer in the house today.  Brewer.  And a lot of people asking if this is a best-of show because they're here on Brewer.  Or if we left early.  No.  It's live.  Brewer's here live.  We need a new tape of Jim Brewer so we can leave. 
[01:46:00]  So we can leave early.  We can leave at 6.30 down the road.  We're taping here.  You know we do that.  It's tradition.  If we have somewhere to go and we can't stay with the program until 7 o'clock, we throw on a Brewer bit.  At 6.30.  At 6.30 and leave.  It's tradition now.  So anytime we have stuff to do, people will go on Instant Feedback and go, oh, what, another Brewer bit being thrown into the machine?  Yeah.  So that's why you're here today is to give us an out in like a month from now.  You're a cut-out early bit. 
[01:46:30]  It's the best of the worst of the comics on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show is taking a short break in the middle of March.  Because let's face it, when you work in a confined environment with a bunch of volatile personalities, all of whom think that their opinion is the most valid, you can pretty much last a few months before you want to go on a fucking shooting rampage.  Die!  Die!  Die!  So we're taking a little time for ourselves to decompress and regroup. 
[01:47:00]  Until then, enjoy the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Or go outside.  You're all pretty much shut-ins anyway.  More than a quarter century in the making.  That's been a real blessing.  35 albums.  My life's been grand.  Almost 60 number one hits.  Over 400 songs.  All my exes live in Texas.  The music.  The life.  The career.  It's been a long time since I've mowed the grass. 
[01:47:30]  Three jukeboxes full of boot-scrapin' honky-tonk hits.  Street country.  Debues April 1st on XM17.  How would you like a self-tuning robotic guitar?  Welcome into Tomorrow.  I'm Dave Graveline.  The Gibson Robot Guitar electronically tunes itself.  A player selects standard A440 tuning or any of six tuning presets,  then hits the control knob and strums the guitar once.  The robotic ears, brain, and motors of the guitar bring all six strings into perfect tune, 
[01:48:00]  signaled by the knob lighting up a symbol for each string, as it happens, hands-free.  The added technology is small and lightweight and in no way changes the feel of the guitar.  String changes or tuning changes can now happen almost instantly,  meaning less time on chores and more time for music.  The $2,500 Gibson Robot Guitar is for anyone who prefers spending more time playing  and less time bringing it into tune just about every session, 
[01:48:30]  and especially when changing strings or changing tuning.  The B-O-B-Anthony Show.  It's the best.  Boo!  The best.  Of the worst.  Of the comedians.  Of the B-O-B-Anthony Show.  Just hilarious.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Really funny.  Really awful, too, by the way.  I'll acknowledge that.  Holy mother of God.  And then other people thinking that Jay Moore was going to...  We were stalling and that Jay was going to call in at 540. 
[01:49:00]  And I told you guys, no, he'll call as soon as he's not busy anymore.  And here he is, our buddy, our pal...  Jay Moore!  Jay Moore.  Gentlemen, I've been getting reports on the West Coast of Brewers destroying on the show,  Norton's destroying on the show.  I just hope I can semi-destroy on the show.  I'm in good hands.  What's up?  Don't you worry about it.  Jay, we talked Friday.  Yeah, we did.  Hold on, hold on.  You weren't too crazy about the idea I floated you.  All right, hold on. 
[01:49:30]  You've got to go with this because you kind of said, I don't really want to talk about  this on the air.  No, no, we're going to do it.  All right, because it was so effing funny to me.  And I was laughing so hard because I know what Ant's reaction would be.  I have not told Ann about your idea.  Let me just preface this by saying more sports debuts tomorrow night on ESPN.  Yes.  I think, I don't know, we're on after billiards or something.  They're promoing the hell out of the show.  It's hilarious.  It's amazing.  I'm watching baseball because I got my rotisserie team all set up. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  I'm already in the books with the home run from Sheffield.  I'm already kicking everyone's ass.  And then I see my own promo come up in the corner of the screen right when Fernando Vina  takes a ball off his nutsack.  It's pretty exciting stuff.  Yeah.  Right.  But my head was right below his nutsack.  All right.  So you call me Friday after the show.  All right.  Here's the deal, Anthony.  All right.  I want you guys on the show.  Obviously, we talked about it forever.  And I haven't forgotten.  But when I got a moment to think of something.  Jay, I got to interrupt you.  Jay takes care of his friends and he wants to put Ant and I on ESPN. 
[01:50:30]  You guys will be on the show.  I would be flattered.  I will fly you out myself if it comes down to that.  So he gives me his first idea on Friday.  How hard was I laughing, dude?  You laughed so hard that Sandy from the other room screamed, are you okay?  I've never seen his face that red.  Anthony, here's the idea.  You know Saturday Night Live, they have a cold open?  Right.  Okay.  We want to do a cold open for the show. 
[01:51:00]  Okay.  We're working on Ozzy Osbourne right now.  Are you kidding, man?  You're going to get Ozzy on the show?  Well, he was in, he was out.  Now it's 75, then it was 80, then it was 70.  But you can't miss what you never had, so F him.  And we're going to be fine if we have him or not.  It'd be nice to have him.  But we also have the rapper Rakim.  We have Slayer booked.  Everyone's in the books.  We're all good.  Sharon, get me on that show, Sharon.  So here's the idea, Anthony.  For you guys to be on more sports in the cold, I think this would be awesome.  All right.  Sell it, Jay.  Sell it. 
[01:51:30]  I'm getting a massage.  Okay.  In the ESPN, wherever you would go.  I go at ESPN Studios to get a massage.  All right.  Barry crashes through the door.  My manager, Barry Katz.  Uh-huh.  And says, Jay, what the heck are you doing?  You're on the air in five seconds.  I say, well, I thought I'd relax by getting a massage from the ESPN masseuses played by  you and Anthony.  You and Opie.  What?  What?  So hold on.  Let me finish.  Let me finish.  What?  You're dressed in all white like the good humor man. 
[01:52:00]  But you're real masseuses.  Okay?  Hold on.  Wait.  Wait.  No, no, no.  I don't even want to stay for the ending.  Hold on.  Let me get this straight.  I am trying to put you on television.  Let me get this straight.  We are massaging Jay Moore.  That is correct.  In the white suit, like white pants, white shirt, white shoes. 
[01:52:30]  Got ourselves a pretty little faggot.  So I tell Barry, I thought I'd relax before the monologue by getting a nice massage from  the ESPN masseuse.  Uh-huh.  Barry looks at me and says, Jay, ESPN doesn't have masseuses.  Oh.  And then I look at you two guys, and then you two guys just basically say, we just wanted  to meet Ozzy.  And you pack up and you leave.  And I look at Barry, and I say, we tell no one. 
[01:53:00]  Okay.  Terrific.  I knew you would have got that on me.  It didn't matter.  It's time.  You bastard.  So again.  You just don't want to play a guy that would massage another guy.  Again, I must say, we are massaging Jay Moore.  Stupid.  Are you kidding me?  I will say this.  Yeah.  The marijuana intake, when I thought of that idea, might have been a little greater than 
[01:53:30]  normal.  Oh, jeez.  I don't want to get the AIDS, fellas.  But Opie's still laughing.  Simple words.  I am laughing.  He's laughing three days later.  I am laughing now, and Opie, yes, has been laughing for three days.  So what part of your body are?  Are we massaging?  Good question, Opie.  Like it matters.  In the script that was actually written up.  Yeah.  Because I told my writers to get this on the fast track.  Right. 
[01:54:00]  For the sole purpose, we have to get Opie and Anthony on television.  Uh-huh.  I believe she moved from my thigh to my calf.  You're insane.  Your legs.  My legs.  I don't need to be real.  But look, you're not gay.  You just wanted to be Aussie.  I don't want to be on TV that bad.  Hey.  But you know what, gentlemen?  We're talking about it, which is a good thing. 
[01:54:30]  We're going to make it happen.  They're all pink on the inside.  That's one way to look at it.  So if we're working as that is the worst case scenario.  Right.  We're going to come up with madcap fun for the three of us to get down.  You stupid faggot.  So who has to massage the thigh and who gets to massage the calf?  Because I'm thinking if I'm massaging the calf, it's less gay at least.  Well, I thought only Anthony would massage me and Opie would be sort of an instructor telling him the muscles. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, yeah.  Saying, okay, that's nice.  Quadricep.  Make sure you get all four.  That's why it's called a quad.  And Anthony says, right, got it.  You can act like a man.  Get on your knees and fag like a dog.  It's what I do.  It's all I do.  Why don't you get Dice to massage you?  Look what he's doing now.  Now look at me.  Look what he's doing now.  Now look at her, stupid.  Norton, what do you think of that idea?  Dude, just to meet Ozzy, I don't know, man. 
[01:55:30]  If the sketch doesn't go in real life, I'll give you a hummer if you can put me in the scene with him.  You can't say that.  I'm not going to deny that it's gay.  It's funny, though.  Eric on line seven goes, did Jay just come out of the closet?  No, in fact, gentlemen.  Yeah.  Opie's still laughing at the thought of Anthony massaging my thighs.  Don't just stare at him.  I was laughing so hard the other night because I know how Ant would react to something like that.  He doesn't even like shaking hands. 
[01:56:00]  Ant, yeah.  Ant, yeah.  Ant, yeah.  Oh, Anthony.  Yeah.  That guy that said that thing in the post about what you were worth, is that all resolved?  Oh, yeah.  That's taken care of.  Dominic Barber, yeah.  I wish I was your lawyer.  Really?  Oh, God.  Every time the guy opened his mouth, I would just look at the jury and go, $100 million.  Everything this guy says started with him publicly saying something $99 million away from the truth. 
[01:56:30]  And he didn't call the lawyer or the judge.  He decided to take it publicly to let you know for the strict purpose to mislead you.  Consider the source.  Yeah, but $100 million.  Jay Moore, attorney at law.  I'd love to be an attorney.  Wouldn't that be fun?  Because you could say whatever you want and just withdraw it.  That's why I'd be like, well, she's a whore.  Withdrawn, never mind.  Yeah, yeah, that's what they do.  And it's withdrawn.  And it's withdrawn, that withdrawn.  It's not on the record, but you still said it.  They still have it in their heads when they go into that little room and wonder if O.J. killed people or not. 
[01:57:00]  People are now asking, Tom from Philly wants to know if I have to give you a happy ending with the massage.  No, there is no pull release written into the sketch.  And how naked are you on this table?  Good question, O.B.  How naked, Jay?  Let's try to see if we can come to an agreement.  So, you know what?  This is a good sign because we're working together for a happy medium.  I am a happy medium.  I just can't believe Anthony didn't put the kibosh on it right away.  Oh, he did.  He just asked me how dressed I was. 
[01:57:30]  So he's still thinking about it.  O.B. asked how dressed you are.  No, we're just trying to get another five minutes out of this for our show.  Oh, I will.  Are you naked?  You got a towel on?  Are you on your chest or on your back?  You know, just to beat the show, like, you know, I'd like to show off the pipes a little  bit.  The pipes?  All three.  So you'll just have, like, a towel around your waist?  No, I think I'd probably, you know, be in a robe.  Will you be on your back?  Oh, my God.  My wife last night told me I laugh like Burt Reynolds, and I think she's right. 
[01:58:00]  Uh-oh.  That's a bad news.  Look, now we're getting people saying, uh, is Jay's new show more sports or more fags?  Come on, this is just an idea I had.  And this is not the type of threesome Ant enjoys.  But, you know, the bottom line is, that was an idea that's not going to take for you to.  However, it's a cute idea.  Is this what he does?  Just say it.  It's too fag.  He pitches something that we're not going to do, so then the real pitch seems so doable. 
[01:58:30]  Is that it, Jay?  You're a shrewd one.  Well, look, you guys got to get on the show.  We're going to get you on the show.  I would be honored to be on the show.  Everyone knows, everyone that works here knows that you guys are eventually going to be on  this show.  So, you guys would, I would be honored to have you guys on the show, because it's what we  always talked about, what we would do for one another.  And I just think that's, you know, you got to do it for your friends.  You guys.  Yeah, but let's, a little less gay. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah.  A little less gay?  A little less gay.  Put it this way.  Because of the gayness of it, I'd pass up the role on your show to do a cameo on Oz  as some guy's prague.  Hey, with Jim Brown in jail, we could do Celebrity Oz right now.  Celebrity Oz.  That's a funny idea.  Yeah, that's good.  I asked one of the black guys in the office, I said, how does he feel about Jim Brown fasting?  And he went, yeah, Jim Brown fast.  And I was like, no, he's fasting. 
[01:59:30]  But Jim Brown's got to be careful.  You know what happens to weak guys in prison?  Yeah.  Wow.  Jim Brown could cut off both his legs and roll his torso through the jail, and guys would  part like the Red Sea.  It's like the sheriff's cell with Jim Brown.  Good God.  All right, so something less gay.  This is my second idea.  Jay, I have an idea.  Something less gay.  Maybe they could roll around naked on the floor with Matthew Shepard.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Now people are asking me if I do it if Jay was in the Chris Walken character.  You know what?  Gay. 
[02:00:00]  That makes it less gay?  No, that's still gay.  Let's hear the pitch as Christopher Walken.  Maybe something will come to light here.  Yeah, sure.  Look, gentlemen, I appreciate you giving me a massage before my first show.  You get me pumped up.  That's a little too hard on my thigh.  Thank you.  But I am breathing.  Look, gentlemen, I need a pull release at the end.  I need the early birth special and go heavy on the oil. 
[02:00:30]  And before you finish, I'm talking to Anthony.  Make sure that this watch finds itself in my ass.  No, I got a different.  Anthony, this one's just for you.  All right.  All right, so this is idea number two.  Okay.  Number two.  Here we go.  Me and Anthony in my office at Moorsports are doing blow off Tara Reid's ass.  Nice.  Okay. 
[02:01:00]  So far, I'm in.  Anthony says, all right, I'm all pumped up.  Let's get to it.  I look down at my crotch and I say, uh-oh.  And then Opie comes in and you guys just double penetrate her and then I go and do the show.  So you guys, we leave.  America is left with the impression that you and Anthony, not only are you such good friends  and such good counterparts and so good for one another on the air as well as off the air,  that when you fly coast to coast to be on a friend's show, that you guys are so cool, 
[02:01:30]  you actually have double penetration with Tara Reid.  We got to put Tara Reid on the rotisserie.  Right.  And I'm the one that's worse for it because I already shot my load in my pants.  So that's the second idea.  Right.  That's the second idea.  Most of that made it.  The third idea.  Hold on, hold on.  Most of that made the air.  Yeah, I would think so.  We're tag teaming Tara Reid.  Yeah, we get to.  In that scenario.  Yeah, we get to put her on the rotisserie. 
[02:02:00]  I thought I explained it expertly as far as radio censorship.  You did pretty good, and then you lost it in your pants or something.  Okay.  Yeah.  That, that, um.  I was a premature ejaculator in that sketch.  See?  You were.  It happens.  So now not only do we know that you two are down with the rotisserie.  Hold on, hold on.  Just to let you know, they are dumping like crazy.  Are they?  That's insane.  If I was Dr. Laura, I could say,  so this is a man that suffers from premature ejaculation.  Maybe you think you could say that.  Maybe the Pope's shaking extra, extra. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, he's shaking a lot and hitting the button.  Hitting the button.  As he sits back there.  Hey, Jay, as long as you don't combine the two ideas  and having you finish prematurely while I massage your leg.  No, no, no.  Because that's, you know.  And this is, I didn't even get to the third idea.  Uh-oh, there's a third idea?  All right.  This is the best one.  I like you finishing while he's massaging your thigh,  and in the credits, you see Anthony with an eye patch.  And then Anthony says, we tell no one.  Right.  All right, this is the new idea. 
[02:03:00]  This is the third one that I think is the one that's really going to put it over the top.  Does it involve Tara Reid again?  No.  All right, I'm out.  It also does not involve Opie.  Oh, wow.  How does this happen?  It's in a steam room.  It's Opie, Jeff Garcia, and Cordell Stewart.  No.  Jay.  Already, no.  Steam room.  You're at Plato's Retreat.  You're at Plato's Retreat, and you're the towel boy.  Okay, forget that, then.  All right, right.  No steam room. 
[02:03:30]  Cordell Stewart, Jeff Garcia, and Anthony in the steam room.  No one's touching each other.  Right, because that would be gay.  Right.  Yes, if those three guys touched each other, run through for 4,000 yards,  and, you know, one of those three isn't gay.  So we're in the steam room.  So Anthony, Cordell Stewart, and Jeff Garcia in the steam room.  Right.  Okay.  Okay.  Oh, God, here we go.  Okay. 
[02:04:00]  Now, it's a sports show.  You have to keep in mind.  Uh-huh.  Greg Louganis enters.  Who?  I don't want to ruin it if I answer who.  And he falls down and splits his head wide open,  just to make it a little more interesting.  And everyone's down screaming, I don't want to get the age.  Right.  Now, that's funny.  And one of the three of Anthony, Cordell, or Jeff says,  well, I already have it.  Ah, there's the joke.  I got nothing.  I just wanted to hear Anthony's reaction to the massage skit. 
[02:04:30]  The massage skit is quite gay.  When he told me this Friday, he was dead serious.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But then, you know what?  When I slept on it, you know, it is like saying,  hey, look, we're his friends and we massage his legs.  Right.  I say you put one, you have it yourself on a table with just a towel  showing off that terrific body,  and you have maybe Opie on the feet and Anthony on the shoulders  or vice versa.  You've got to have one on each end of you.  And then what?  What are you talking about?  It goes wherever it goes.  It's going to be like it's even close to that happening.  I'm just saying.  That's the massage.  You've got two massages. 
[02:05:00]  You don't want them both on the legs.  You have one on the legs and one on the shoulders.  Whoa, Jim.  It's my sketch, my show, my massage.  If I want four manhands on my thigh, I'm going to get it.  Theoretically, Opie could be on one leg and I could be on the other.  It could be, yeah.  In a world that ain't going to happen.  Jay, you've still got to do that opening just so we could all laugh,  all the listeners of this show.  Oh, my God.  Imagine tuning in to more sports and you see the opening that we turned down.  That we turned down.  And you have, like, gay Broadway dancers doing it.  The joke would be that it's not even that gay. 
[02:05:30]  That's what you're missing.  Oh, geez.  The joke's on us then.  No, the only thing gay is, like, your white outfits, your massage outfits.  No, I don't think the outfits are the gayest thing.  Me touching your leg is the gayest thing.  But you weren't massaging me because you were gay and you wanted to have, like, gay sex.  You were just two guys from Long Island that figured out a way to get into the studio to watch the show.  And that's by BSing your way into massaging the host.  And that's exactly what the viewers are going to think when they see you and I massaging your guys. 
[02:06:00]  Jay, when you're laying there and we're massaging, are you, like, laying down going,  Oh, no, because that would make me seem gay.  That would make me seem gay and people already think I'm gay.  Reach under the towel.  New idea.  Oh, no.  No, no, I'm joking.  No, so that idea is dead and buried.  But we're going to shoot it anyway with somebody else.  And you guys are going to go, you know what?  That son of a bitch was right.  It's funny.  Hey, Jay, do you have any other news today?  Yes, I do. 
[02:06:30]  Would you like to share?  My wife is pregnant.  Oh, nice, man.  Oh, congratulations.  It's been a soap opera on our show for at least two years.  Wow.  Jay finally got the job done.  Yeah, we pulled the goalie.  Jay, it's a sports show.  You pulled the goalie.  Yeah, because, you know, we heard you had a low sperm count.  Yeah, the doctors told us it was 0.2% chance of us having a child.  Wow.  He said, you know what? 
[02:07:00]  I will never allow Western medicine to strip me of hope so that guy can kiss my ass.  We fired him.  Jay, is this baby going to pop out looking like Nomar Garcia-Para?  I hope so, if he can hit.  I don't care what he looks like, and I don't care who the father is.  I know it's not me.  You want to explain how this was accomplished?  Hold the goalie.  Because I think it's pretty interesting.  In vitro.  In vitro, Anthony.  A little in vitro.  Where the funny, he was telling me this, and I was laughing really hard, too, because  I guess you guys look at your little men under the microscope and decide which one you want. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, you actually look at all the different animals.  Oh, wow, ain't that a crap shoot.  And they grade them, A through C.  They grade his sperm.  I'm a good swimmer.  I'm a good swimmer.  Some of the sperm literally are sitting there like a dog after you show them a card trick.  And don't dump out of this, you ass.  Yeah.  We're allowed to talk about this.  So they grade them, and then you decide which one you want.  Wow, and you know you're playing God right there, man.  No, no, no, we're not. 
[02:08:00]  We're not.  Why, you pick like 10, and then he picks one of them?  No, because you just want, you want all A's.  You want tadpoles that are all A's.  I don't want to get dumped, so I'm trying to be, because you have a retard on the button up there.  You're right.  Who does do the button?  He was in vitro, and they picked a Z.  That's what I'm saying.  That's true, baby.  Where are the buttons?  It swam around in circles and wanted cotton candy.  Retard.  Fish sticks are good.  Did you get to check out your tadpoles? 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, I did.  I looked at them with a microscope with another guy.  And if you think there's a faggy feeling in this lifetime, there's no more faggy feeling than walking into a room with a cup of clam chowder and handing it to another man.  And then he says, great, let's take a look.  Everything's absolutely normal right now.  As long as he doesn't say shots?  I can hope, though.  Hey, Jay, just as a goof, did he point out some retarded ones for you?  Like, oh, that one.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:09:00]  Don't pick that one.  What was it?  Philip Wurfman.  And what was wrong with some of those?  They just came out like, you know, they were just high.  Yeah, not good.  My wife's like, you had to ride a bike and wear tight underpants and smoke pot every day.  Nice job on the sperm count.  Little, little cell-sized hockey helmets on them.  Trying to smash through the egg.  One of them actually had a Division of Motor Vehicles employee identification card.  That's a bad one.  You steer clear of that.  No, that's the one we're using.  Oh, great.  Wouldn't you love to be a doctor like that just to look at the guy who's checking out his own stuff 
[02:09:30]  and go, imagine that splashed on your chin.  Could be arranged.  What is that not dumped out of?  Because it was all in code, my friend.  It's all in vagueness.  I don't even know what we're talking about.  You gotta teach me the code.  All perfectly shaven back there.  Won't dump out of that.  Jim could have been talking about a friendly scribble.  We don't know.  Right.  Yes.  I have no idea.  Exactly.  Or a **** from a big fat ****.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  You can't say that. 
[02:10:00]  You can't say that?  Of course.  So then what?  You pick out the ones you want and then what happens?  We don't pick out anything.  They just make sure that they're dealing with strictly A's.  Ah.  And the egg is the egg.  What determines an A, though?  What?  What determines an A?  Oh, I'll tell you.  Motility.  Motility.  Strength of character.  They actually give them also a wonderland test.  Strength of character?  They get a wonderland test like the NFL draft.  How well he could hit to the right field?  Exactly. 
[02:10:30]  Lefties.  Right.  Mike Piazza was hit four times this spring, gentlemen.  Really?  Yes, we know that.  He's used to it.  And then he choked a minor league pitcher after the game.  Well, he finally fought back.  Yeah, five innings later when the kids got his back to him walking to the showers.  Wow.  He needed to do something, though.  He was so mad, he got in his eye rock and could not even be soothed by the sounds of  Journey.  All right, so we have the tadpoles.  You pick them out, and then what?  Then they just say, tadpole, meat, egg. 
[02:11:00]  In some kind of a test tube environment, huh?  Wherever Jim Norton goes, that's where they do it.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Tommy.  What's up, guys?  What's up?  Dude, I don't know what you've been talking about.  They're dumping out of everything.  That line before when you said they didn't dump out on Norton, they dumped out on two.  I don't know what you've been talking about.  They dumped out of...  J-Mo, a big fan, by the way.  Can't wait for your show.  Thanks, brother.  I appreciate it.  No problem.  But I don't know what anybody's talking about. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, they might have dumped out of this thing I said that I said intentionally get dumped  out of Ant dumped out of that.  Yeah, yeah.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Before that, when you said, oh, I'm talking in code, that hairy background.  Oh, yeah.  They get dumped out of that.  Why would they dump out of that, you faggot?  A splash on the chin thing?  Of what?  I didn't mention anything.  Of course you didn't.  Buck!  Loves a fucking job, doesn't he?  Later, J.  See you later, guys.  Wow.  Yeah, they dump out of... 
[02:12:00]  He dumps out of stuff.  Forget the dump button.  That is ridiculous.  Let's make sure once and for all we're all on the same page.  This masseuse thing is going to go down, right?  No.  I want to hear more...  But you guys are going to come on the show, right?  Help out?  I would love to.  I think that would be really cool.  Opie and Anthony on ESPN.  We'll piggyback it with Slayer or some really cool guest.  Gay Marco says he wants to massage your third leg in that gag, if that's possible.  It was only a matter of time.  Underneath the towel.  It was only a matter of time.  Of course.  How about Ant and I are part of an in vitro skit?  An in vitro skit. 
[02:12:30]  You're there and you're looking at your tadpoles and you look through the microscope  and there's a tadpole with my head on one.  Now you're talking some CGI magic.  CGI magic.  There you go, yeah.  There's a tadpole with Opie's head on it.  Right.  And Opie looks up like, oops.  And looks at me like, I'm going to be mad.  Yeah.  And then Sandy walks in and says, honey, are you ready?  And I look at Opie and I go, it's okay.  And then I leave with Sandy.  Well, no, no.  How about you go, where the hell are the samples? 
[02:13:00]  And O and A both walk in and go, into a Petri dish.  But see, Jim, that's actually incorrect because the sample can be altered by DNA.  That's why when you go in the room to put the dolphins in the tank by yourself, you can't  have spit or like your wife.  Really?  I didn't know that.  DNA might just screw it up.  Hope old goody gumdrops didn't jump out of that one.  What do you got, Lawrence Welk on the button? 
[02:13:30]  Oh, no.  Worse.  No one that hip.  Worse.  What's his name?  Bag of douche.  Bag of douche.  You're allowed to.  See, you know something?  I'm going to go, I'm going to, when we go to break, I'm going to go down the hall.  I'm going to go to the perfectly tanned Ken Stevens, freshly back from his vacation, if  he's still here, and say, why can't we talk about this?  Why can't we use the S-P word?  Because that seems to be the problem when we're discussing this. 
[02:14:00]  We're not discussing an entire batch.  We're talking about the cells themselves in a context that is completely safe.  And why can't you say, uh, premature Jocka Jocka?  Right, you can say that.  He's even dumping out words like stuff.  Ass, you have f***ed up our show to...  Wow, that almost really, really hurt me.  What happened?  I went for the dump button, Opie threw the mic, and it really came close to my face. 
[02:14:30]  And broke a light bulb.  Now would be a great time for Paul Bond to run in and grab Opie.  He just f***ed up a whole segment.  This is funny, interesting stuff, you ass!  Go get another job!  You don't know what the f*** you're doing down the hall!  Right!  Holy crap!  Okay, I got it.  I got the idea.  You guys play the censors for more sports.  Yeah, we'll dump out of everything. 
[02:15:00]  No, no, no.  And everything I think I can't say, you guys are like, no problem.  We need a new dump guy.  A dump guy that understands our show, understands content of a radio show.  And the law.  I'm sick of this crap.  We just did 20 minutes of really, really funny, creative, interesting stuff,  and the whole thing was chopped to crap.  Go get another job.  You don't know what the f*** you're doing anymore.  You're being overcautious and you're f***ing up our radio show. 
[02:15:30]  You know, I think of the guy that's driving a UPS truck.  When you start dumping out of words like stuff, you got the problem.  Company man.  I think of guys driving a UPS truck on the Long Island Expressway,  and all he wants to do is listen to Opie and Antony,  because it makes his miserable drive home better.  And this show is designed for specifically that guy.  And now that guy's getting half a show.  I'm sick of this, because Ant and I know the rules better than the guy that's supposedly dumping.  Absolutely.  Give us all the stupid dump buttons and we'll dump out of our own show. 
[02:16:00]  I don't need you down the hall f***ing with us anymore.  If we didn't know...  Craig, Craig, Craig, you don't know what you're doing.  Yeah.  Go down the hall and resign.  You're screwing this show up.  Go down the hall and resign.  Face facts.  You don't have a freaking clue.  Can we say this guy's name on more sports?  He decided because we made it obvious that we were talking about the SP word,  that now he's getting dumped out of everything.  That's not how it works! 
[02:16:30]  That is not how it works.  You don't even know that that isn't how it works.  That's not how it works.  Jesus.  Why don't you just have somebody go in there and get Billy Hayes,  a lot of machines, to go in there and give the guy a beating?  Yeah, well.  What do you mean, yeah, well, Imus?  Yeah, well.  Yeah, well.  What the hell did I break?  The light bulb up there.  Which one?  I was showered in glass and a big heavy microphone whooshed past me  as I lunged for the dump button to dump out of your F word. 
[02:17:00]  And my shoes fell off and my glasses broke.  And now I know what to do.  Fuck garbage.  I burnt myself on the light bulb piece.  I'm suing you for $130 million.  And then on top of it, we need some kind of system in place  because when he's dumping out like that, we don't know he's dumping out like that.  So now it's 20 minutes of wasted radio. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  Wasted radio because the listeners can't follow what we're doing, Craig.  Someone has to run down the hall and go,  Well, look, this is no good, no good.  Instead of putting 20 minutes of crap on the radio.  There's no reason Jay cannot explain his in vitro fertilization and use medical terminology.  And then as we goof on things, we goof on them using code words.  It's fine.  It is fine.  Find me one transcript of any finable offense that is in that context. 
[02:18:00]  Find me one.  Find me one example.  You won't be able to because it won't happen.  We understand things that are completely defendable, Craig.  You don't.  You're dumping out of everything.  How did Craig get his job?  I don't know.  Why?  What do you mean how?  How do all the rest of the incompetent people around here get their jobs? 
[02:18:30]  I don't know because I only deal with like you two and everybody else that's very competent.  Whole list of people.  Well, I don't know what to tell you guys.  Dude, you don't understand how funny you were and the whole thing just got dumped out of.  It drives me nuts.  Well, look, this is what we do now.  Craig, do us a favor.  Next time Ant and I are doing a segment and we completely suck, just dump out like crazy so we'll have an excuse and make believe, oh my God, that was one of the best bits we ever did. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  I can't believe what you guys missed.  You have to say suck?  It all depends on the context.  Unless he's dumping, then no, you probably can't say it.  Well, here's a sketch you guys will like.  Not for you two, just a random sketch.  Yeah.  Of course, everyone wants to see this on TV.  Things white guys can't say on television.  And I just have two black guys come out and say crazy things like, hey man, take care of your kids.  How come there are no fathers at the NBA draft? 
[02:19:30]  Why?  Dominican, you're black.  No?  Nothing?  That's funny.  Yeah, but now we're up, you know, this is Craig guy.  Yeah, see?  He bummed out the party.  Jack tool.  No, no.  He's not going to wreck our party.  There's a little...  He's not going to wreck our party.  Come on, let's be positive.  Well, Jay, we got to go.  Well, you guys got apoplectic about that.  Hey, that's a word for stoner spelling, babe.  Oh, dump out of it.  It might be something dirty. 
[02:20:00]  Apoplectic.  No, it means having a heart attack, Craig.  All right.  You know what?  You know what?  Good.  Okay, good.  Craig, you're a...  Hey, wait a minute.  Wait a minute, Jay.  What did I say?  You can't use that word.  Even I know that.  And I'm stupid.  I don't know anything about what should be dumped out.  Craig, you're a know-it-all.  Well, Jay, this segment will sound hilarious when Ant and I are on vacation and we put all the beeps in.  Or don't put the beeps in because they didn't have to be in on the first one. 
[02:20:30]  Right.  So someday people will find out how funny this really was.  Jay, my friend, thank you.  We got to move on.  Okay, but you guys are down for...  We won't do the Game of Seuss thing, but we're going to do something.  I would love that.  Absolutely.  And I think that's just what America wants to see on television is you guys.  And we're going to make that happen.  That'll be fine.  And I'm in a position now to make that happen.  More sports.  That pumps me up.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I love you guys and fire that guy and we'll be back.  All right.  Thanks, Jack.  We'll be back.  I want to hear listeners.  We'll be back right after this.  The worst.  It's the worst.  Of the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:21:00]  Why don't we move on to other things here, finally?  Tony, you're next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Yo, what do you say, Deke?  What's up?  Hey, nice head, Deke.  Nice show, Deke.  First of all, I want to say I'm psyched because last night Jay Moore killed on ESPN.  Yeah, you know something?  Jay Moore's more sports was on last night.  And what a good job.  Really funny.  He started the whole show with, okay, terrific.  Yeah, that was his first line there.  Okay, terrific. 
[02:21:30]  That was that.  He hit off you guys a little bit too, man.  And, like, when he was doing the Rulon Gardner eBay thing, I just kept thinking about, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  We got a foot up.  We got a foot for sale.  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.  But the beginning, the opening scene.  Now, Jay wanted us to do this.  He wanted us to fly out.  He was going to fly to L.A.  And be the two guys that are massaging him.  As they pull the camera back, you see Jay's getting his massage. 
[02:22:00]  And who is it?  His manager?  Barry.  Barry.  And says, what are you doing?  He goes, I'm just getting a little massage before the show to relax by the ESPN masseuse.  And then Barry goes, there is no ESPN masseuse.  And Jay looks around like, what?  And the guy that's massaging him looks into the camera kind of and runs away.  Runs away.  Runs away.  Massaging him.  He had those bony shoulders, man.  But, I mean, when you were talking about midgets before, when he was standing next to the jockeys, 
[02:22:30]  he was about two inches tall of them.  I noticed that myself.  And Jay's not short.  I don't know what that was all about.  I think the jockeys are getting a little bigger and taller these days.  But what was disturbing about the opening of more sports, he went ahead and did the massage bit.  And a bunch of people have been calling, going, because they don't know what we look like.  They're like, for the love of God, please tell me that wasn't Opie or Anthony.  Because now the listeners are convinced one of us has decided last minute, like, all right, I'll do it.  No, no, that was just some guy there.  Opie's not going to do it, but I'll do it.  Or, you know, Ant's not going to do it, but I'll do it. 
[02:23:00]  I know what it was with the jockeys.  They were like that deke across the street.  They had them on phone books.  There you go.  Later, guys.  Thanks, Tony.  What was most disturbing, though, and I said he was going to do this.  I said it, and I'm so glad we weren't pressured into doing that bit.  I said he was going to moan, and what did he do?  He moaned right when the goddamn thing starts.  Hey, Rick, do you have the Jay Moore moan?  He's getting the massage, and he goes, oh.  And I said, I go, so, Jay, what's going to happen? 
[02:23:30]  We're going to be massaging you, and you're going to go, oh, oh.  He goes, no, I'm not going to moan.  And I'm tuning in.  The first thing I see is Jay moaning.  Right.  Oh.  Oh.  But he did a great job last night.  Yeah, the show's funny.  It was nice.  When they went to the track, that was some funny stuff, man.  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  Rick's got it all set up now. 
[02:24:00]  Let's start with the Jay Moore moan.  Yeah, let's listen to the Jay Moore moan from more sports last night on ESPN.  Oh, that is good stuff.  You like that?  I love that.  We do my thighs.  Jay, what are you doing?  You have to get ready for the show.  Well, I'm a little nervous and tense, you know, so I thought I'd get a massage from the ESPN studio masseuse.  Jay, we don't have a studio masseuse.  And that's where... 
[02:24:30]  You know, and that's where the guy ran out and Jay made the funny face because this is Radio Inn.  Dude, dude, that sounded like gay porno.  Stop it.  That sounded like gay porno.  Listen to the beginning.  Oh, that is good stuff.  You like that?  I love that.  We do my thighs.  Jay, what are you doing?  You have to get ready for the show.  Well, I'm a little nervous and tense, you know, so I thought I'd get a massage from the ESPN studio masseuse.  Jay, we don't have a studio masseuse. 
[02:25:00]  That's not that hard.  And then he goes, this never happened.  Oh, that...  Oh, that...  What is it?  He goes, oh, it's good stuff.  Yeah, you like that?  Yeah.  Just the beginning part.  Oh, that is good stuff.  You like that?  I love that. 
[02:25:30]  We do my thighs.  Jay, what are you doing?  You have to get ready for the show.  Right when he says that, that's enough.  I'm a little nervous and tense, you know, so I thought I'd get a massage from the ESPN studio masseuse.  Jay, we don't have a studio masseuse.  Hello?  Hi.  Yeah, I'm...  How you guys doing?  How gay is that?  Oh, yeah, that's good stuff.  You like that?  Another man.  You like that? 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, just do my thighs more.  Hello?  Hi.  You like that?  Hi.  You like that?  That's good stuff, huh?  Who else is...  Hello?  Hello?  Hi.  Hi.  Welcome to the gay chat line.  A bell...  You'll hear a bell ringing sound when someone new enters the chat.  Hi.  Hi.  What's your name?  Hello, who's that?  Hi.  My name's Jay.  I'm here with my masseuse.  Oh, that's good.  You like that?  Yeah.  Hello? 
[02:26:30]  How you guys doing?  Hi.  Who's this?  Tom?  I recognize your voice, Tom.  How about a Prescott?  Yeah, you sound hot.  Hi.  Hi, hello.  Hi, who's this?  Suck it!  Oh, you're a French man.  I like it.  You're all fags, the French.  So that's good.  Hello?  You dumb, Rube?  Yeah.  Yep.  Call me things. 
[02:27:00]  I like that.  Hello?  Oh, I ain't calling you, lady.  No, I know.  You're called the gay chat line.  Hello?  Who's this?  You know what I'm talking about when I said that, right?  Yeah.  Hi, Dice.  You want to suck it?  Tease my hair, fat boy.  Yeah, okay.  Talk dirty to me, French man.  Yeah.  You can act like a man.  Oh. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, hit me.  Virgin.  What's this, the iron sheath?  Ah!  Yeah, spit on me.  Degrade me.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  Yeah.  Who's this, Anthony from the Opie and Anthony show?  Too good for everyone.  Wow.  Hello?  Hey, everybody.  We're all going to get laid.  Yeah.  I got to leave. 
[02:28:00]  The gay chat line.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Do we have any more audio from Jay's show, let's say?  Yeah, we got a couple more clips.  You want to hear his open?  Yeah, he had some really funny jokes on his monologue.  Go ahead.  Okay, terrific.  Thank you very much, everybody. 
[02:28:30]  Thanks a lot.  Welcome to my party.  Well, as we all know, fans in Maryland rioted last night to celebrate the Terrapins' victory  over the Hoosiers.  Yeah!  While, see, that guy's happy.  While in Bloomington, Indiana fans rioted in anger over their team's loss.  I've never seen this many angry white people in my life.  You'd think Dave Matthews just announced his retirement.  As long as he's out there lighting stuff on fire. 
[02:29:00]  On fire.  Keep it sports-related.  Magic Johnson, as we all know, is thinking of running for mayor of Los Angeles in the year 2005.  Yeah!  Let me clap him for that.  Yeah, go Magic.  Magic, in a related story, the city of Los Angeles was just canceled.  Magic made the announcement at the opening of one of his Starbucks. 
[02:29:30]  America, huh?  Where else can a poor black man become a multimillionaire and open a Starbucks in South Central  and charge other poor black men $4.50 for coffee?  How about a nice bucket of eggs?  M-Rock wants credit.  There you go.  There's your credit.  M-Rock, you were right.  And just one more clip from Jay's More Sports on ESPN last night.  The Ladies Professional Golf Association held a seminar to teach the ladies how to make  women's golf more appealing. 
[02:30:00]  And it looks like the seminar worked this Sunday at a tournament.  Annika Sorensen was seen working a ball washer with her mouth.  Pirates, you're going to moan.  You can take that to the parking lot.  How many jokes did you write today?  He's such a smart ass.  He's such a smart ass to the freaking audience.  Our buddy did very well last night.  He did.  Chris, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I just wanted to say the joke's on the masseuse.  Jay's not gay. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, there you go.  There you have it.  That's right.  Awesome, Garrett rules.  All right.  We could have done that a little bit.  How about my thigh?  Hey, get my thigh.  Oh, that's good stuff.  How about a nice bucket of eggs?  Oh, that's good stuff.  Yeah.  Pleasure for me.  Pleasure for me to be massaging it, Jack.  Jim Moore, pleasure for me to touch a naked man. 
[02:31:00]  Tommy, what's up?  Yo, you know why ESPN.com has the 10 burning questions?  ESPN.com has an interview with Jay Moore, yes.  I want to read you Jay's question.  They asked him, if you could invite any three people to dinner, living or dead, who would it be and why?  I'll get to the third guy he would invite, Bono.  Bono was so cool you could have sex with him and your friends wouldn't even call you gay.  They'd be like, so what's he like?  No, we'd call you gay.  Yeah.  Listen to you two, I think you're gay.  We would definitely call him gay and then ask him how he was.  Definitely abuse him for that one. 
[02:31:30]  After the sex.  I mean, did you talk about anything else?  As long as he's using Sweet Release, that product that makes his man batter taste better.  Hi, this is Jay Moore and I'm supposed to say something witty and funny here.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony and suck it.  Fuck, I can't do any, Steve.  It's the best of the worst of the comics on the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, hey you.  Well, guess who's back? 
[02:32:00]  It's the best of the worst of the comics on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  This is Patrice O'Neal.  This is the worst of Rich Voss on the Opie and Anthony show.  All right, we're coming to the gig.  Rich Voss' sidewalk comedy tour.  Almost there.  Get Club Soda Kenny to the front of this mob.  What are we going to do?  Everyone is going to walk in first?  How do we do this again?  Yeah, that's how we usually do it.  The audience, Opie.  The audience has to be there. 
[02:32:30]  We all walk in.  Kenny goes in, does the intro.  Rich does his act.  All right.  And then we flee.  I do so many old material.  Yeah, do what you feel as I write.  Oh, you're doing the old stuff.  Yeah.  What's that?  Yeah, the classic bits.  The hackier, the better, I think.  Yeah, hackier, the better, Rich.  So you should be good.  All right.  Exactly.  We have eyed the establishment.  It's looking good.  Wait for the green light.  Wait for the sun.  And you sons of bitches in the road.  You're the ones I want to hit.  With my car.  Stay on the sidewalk.  Wait, miss. 
[02:33:00]  Get a live action shot.  All right.  Here we go.  We're crossing the street.  All right.  Start filing in.  Audience, start filing in.  All right.  We're slowing down to get the audience in there.  Pick a bagel.  Pick a bagel is today's sidewalk comedy location.  On the corner of 57th and 7th.  Go ahead, audience.  All right.  I'll hand over.  Actually, I'll hand my mic to Club Soda Kenny.  Yeah.  Kenny does the intro.  The listeners are filing in amongst the other Manhattanites that have no idea what's about 
[02:33:30]  to happen.  Everyone in.  Here, Kenny.  Here's the mic for the intro.  Go ahead.  Fill up the place.  Listen, stop gawking at them and walking the pick a bagel.  Kenny knows how to get a job done.  Later.  Go ahead.  A question.  We're on the air, sir.  One foot in front of the other.  That's it.  Here we go.  My manager's walking in, and he's really going to try to get me booked here tonight.  Ready?  Yeah.  Okay.  Here it is. 
[02:34:00]  Give him a mic.  Here, Stuart.  Take mine.  Now I want to hear Club Soda Kenny's big intro.  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Pick a Bagel.  Coming to the stage right now, your first comic.  You're really going to love him.  You've seen him on last comic standing.  Give a warm welcome to Mr. Rich Foss.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  A big hand for Kenny, huh?  Look, I'm working out some new stuff.  I got a big audition today, so I need everybody's attention.  I'm a little...  Don't go anywhere, sir.  I know you don't work.  I'm a little depressed, folks. 
[02:34:30]  We just put my grandfather in a rest home.  Well, not actually.  We didn't have the money, so we drove down the turnpike and put him in a rest area.  Thank you.  Actually, he just passed away.  He died of a heart attack.  He would have made it, but he was dyslexic, and he dialed 119.  119.  Oh, come on.  These are good.  Hey, Mom.  Turn your head, Mom.  Look at these hotties right here.  I got some stool softeners in my car.  I love a lady in a walker.  She's already bent over. 
[02:35:00]  Anyhow, do the teeth come out?  What's your name?  Holy shit.  Fred?  Are you married?  What was Lincoln like as the president?  She's cute.  Look at this guy.  He's doing a threesome with these two.  Oh, my God.  His hair is white.  Anyhow, I just got back into town.  I landed yesterday.  I'm at the airport.  I hear over the loudspeaker.  If you see anything suspicious or unusual, contact the authorities.  And right then, I saw a black guy leaving a tip. 
[02:35:30]  Loosen up.  Loosen up, folks.  This is all I got.  You having a good time?  Usually, you're hiding behind a tree.  Anyhow, she's a little aging girl.  Look at her.  Hey, how you doing?  Look at this.  Smell his finger for gunpowder.  We know you.  You probably tunneled here.  Anyhow, he's working the crowd.  Is this a good set?  Folks, bagels on me.  You guys are a good crowd. 
[02:36:00]  That's not a bad set.  Very good.  Very good.  Good night.  I'm going back to Starbucks.  This place sucks.  Close the show, Kenny.  Close the show, Kenny.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  Let's hear it.  Give him a hand.  Rich boss, people.  Give him a hand.  All right.  Wow.  That was some good crowd work there.  That was some real good crowd work.  Yeah.  I think I had him with a few of your jokes.  The improv on the Arab guy behind the counter saying, smell his fingers for gunpowder was 
[02:36:30]  very funny.  And the old people, that wasn't bad.  Very good with the old people.  The stool softener joke and the walker bit, I think, was very funny.  How does a Jew bomb in a bagel place?  This is Rich Voss from Last Comic Standing Season 1 and Season 3.  I was the guy who didn't win.  You're listening to The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the best.  Boo!  The best.  Of the worst.  Of the comedians.  Of the Opie and Anthony show.  Just hilarious. 
[02:37:00]  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Really funny.  Really awful, too, by the way.  I'll acknowledge that.  Holy mother of God.  Now presenting comedian Dave Attell.  We got Dave Attell on the couch.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Thanks for having me in after the pedophile long remix, bitch.  Were you guys talking about Chris Hansen?  Well, he's kind of ruined it for everybody.  You can't really hang out with a kid in an innocent way anymore because adults are just  paranoid.  Did anybody, because you guys know, like, Bill or whatever, who has the joke where they 
[02:37:30]  go, like, Chris Hansen is the blade of, uh, catching, you know, of, like, pedophilia.  Blade.  You know?  Remember, like, what's his name?  Like, he's, like, half vampire, half whatever.  He, like, knows their ways, knows what they like, you know?  It's like mall rock climbing.  Hmm.  Sounds like a place for a pedophile to hang.  You know?  Yeah, he knows.  But Dave.  He's got to take a serum to keep himself from just going out there and abusing kids himself.  Yeah.  You bring up a great point.  Chris Hansen has sat on that couch a couple times.  He has. 
[02:38:00]  There's something not right about him.  When you look in his eyes, you're like, all right, what is this really about, Chris?  He's got a double side to him.  And, uh, you know, I think that, uh, you know, everybody wants to be on that show.  I think that's the new Byron Allen.  You know, it was kind of flattering, sort of, for our show, because, uh, one of our listeners  got caught in one of those things and goes, oh, I saw you on Opie and Anthony once.  He goes, you were great on Opie and Anthony.  Oh, you saw me on Opie and Anthony.  Management doesn't really like when we play this clip because it's not good for the image. 
[02:38:30]  The image.  But, uh, the image.  It's a holiday clip.  The guy actually heard Chris Hansen on our show and still got caught in one of those houses.  Let's just, you know, they should turn lemons into lemonade and just have the salespeople  go after Osh, gosh, bagosh.  And then Chris Hansen wants our emails one day.  He's like, hey, you know, I've been on the show a couple of times.  How about we exchange emails?  I'm like, oh, boy, no, it's one thing you don't want.  I haven't, I'm not hiding anything, but that's the last thing you want to do is give Chris  Hansen any of your info.  You know, here's an email from Greg.Hughes. 
[02:39:00]  Hey, hey, hey.  I was in, uh, I was in New York going into a restaurant one time and it was like a celebrity  sighting that only, I think, Jim and Bill, we would enjoy.  But you know, the people that play the bait on that show, like they're like these kind  of tweener looking girls, you know, like actresses, they couldn't get in a high school  musical or anything like that.  So this is what they're doing, you know?  So I saw one of those girls because I was watching the show, you know, Chris Hansen.  And I was like, that's that girl.  She's the bait.  You know, she'd be like the one, I'll be out in a minute, you know, take off your pants 
[02:39:30]  and if you've got a gun or a taser or a ball gag, put it on the counter, you know?  If you want to start dialing a lawyer, you know, that little like, you know, Pollyanna  thing.  Stop dialing a lawyer.  Yeah.  So it's like, I saw her in a restaurant with the girl from Sex and the City, the redhead  one, you know, kind of butch.  What's her name?  Moran.  Nixon.  What?  Yeah, Cynthia Nixon.  Yeah, Cynthia Nixon.  Whatever she plays on the show, I don't know.  So I went up to them, they were sitting at the table, I go, I'm a huge fan. 
[02:40:00]  And like, Cynthia's like, and I go, no.  I was like, of you, but really of the bait of this girl.  You really recognized her?  Come on.  Yeah, I did.  And I got an autograph and I'm like, and I looked at what she signed and it said like,  thanks for the blah, blah, stay off of my space, wink, wink.  So that's where they're, you know, they're trolling.  They're just joking about it.  That's hysterical.  I sent a MySpace message to the girl who, one of the girls who plays the bait, the original  one, and she said, I'll try to get her on the show.  And she's like, well, you have to contact producers and stuff like that. 
[02:40:30]  She wouldn't just come on the show.  Yeah, I'm sure that's.  Is MySpace right here?  I forget her real name, but yeah, she's accessible.  I'm sure that's why you first sent it.  She's really cute.  She's like 20.  Hey, before.  Can't bring nothing but a t-shirt.  Yeah.  Before the break, Bill turned us on to this video and that's what you saw as you walked in,  Dave was all laughing as you're trying to say hi to everybody.  I apologize for that.  But on YouTube, there's a video called Wussy Skater Fight.  Do you want to explain this again, Bill?  We finally got it.  Yeah, it's basically some sort of fat kid has some sort of a whip or something, a stick. 
[02:41:00]  He tries to hit this little skinny kid with a skateboard.  He hits him once and then the kid just takes his skateboard.  I think he hits him in the back of his thigh.  It's like Charlie Horse area.  Yeah.  And the kid goes down like he's been shot with I don't know what and lets out this whale  like, I don't know, like a loved one just died.  And he's not going to live this down is what you're saying.  They're about, how old would you say they are?  14.  13.  Yeah, maybe around there.  And the fat kid that winds up crying at the end whipped the kid with like a, what can 
[02:41:30]  only be called a switch back in the old days.  Go out and grab a switch.  Bit of hickory.  Yeah, some hickory.  And it hits him with it and the kid just came back and throws a skateboard at him.  Which you should do, right?  And you would think he would just go, ah, you know, F you or something like that.  But he just goes flat down and lets out a cry that only a girl would.  Listen for the cry.  It's quick.  Why does that end? 
[02:42:00]  That's fantastic.  Who turned the camera off?  That was very creepy.  I got up and kicked him.  Yeah, that's it.  I want the long version of that.  That's all it is.  The video's 11 seconds long.  I had to watch it like five times to even realize it wasn't fake.  I'm like, there's no way he just cried.  Like, he's one of those kids who's already like 6'2", but he still hasn't hit puberty.  You know those kids?  He still has all the baby fat.  Yeah.  And there he is crying on the street. 
[02:42:30]  One more time.  Hey, add that to the Steve sounds.  They can mix that into some rocks.  You're laughing stock.  Like a haunted pottery barn.  And then people are bringing up the other video of the fat kid on the log in the woods. 
[02:43:00]  That's another good one.  What, are they shooting at him or something?  Yeah, they're shooting at him with some kind of gun.  I don't know, BB gun or something.  They're saying that's the best crying video.  He's saying stop, stop.  He starts crying.  Stop it.  Stop it.  That's the best kid crying video ever.  All these little moments that used to just happen and were gone when you were a kid.  I mean, everyone knew those situations.  You know, you had the kid that you'd smack in the head.  You'd have a dirt bomb fight and someone would throw a rock.  Everyone would run.  They were just moments.  But now, I mean, they're captured for everyone to enjoy the humor of some little kid getting hurt. 
[02:43:30]  Amazing.  I love it.  It seems to be fat kids with friends with cameras.  Yeah, yeah.  As long as you got a camera, a few friends, and the fat kid, you're in.  You're making YouTube.  It's like, hey, Tubbs, what are you up to today?  I'll bring my camera.  Want to come out to the woods?  Give me a couple of laughs.  Yeah, come on out to the woods.  It's Lord of the Flies, man.  I know it sounds better than a fat boy being whipped or something.  It's just a bad dream, fat boy. 
[02:44:00]  Ow!  Ow!  Skateboard!  Ow!  Why?  Why?  Where is the Sean Penn of their generation to protect?  Like in Bad Boys, you know, he'd like sit up for that kid with the nose.  Yeah, yeah.  Harlots.  Yeah, where is the Sean?  Hey, that's not right.  Leave Piggy alone.  Give me that tape.  He can have it.  Oh, first, let me clear something up with Dave because, oh, my God.  This could get a little awkward. 
[02:44:30]  I was down at the cellar.  Put down the camera.  Put down the camera.  You're not going to whip me.  Put down the camera.  You're not going to whip me like a West Virginia fat boy, are you?  Go ahead.  I was down at the cellar catching your set, laughing.  When?  Having a good time.  Oh, this is a while ago.  Okay.  Yeah, a while ago.  Thanks.  I am an alcoholic.  Yeah.  So am I.  Really?  Yeah, why not?  Okay.  I had a table with three girls at the table and me sitting there enjoying the set.  In front of us, closer to the stage, was another table full of what I would gather you comics 
[02:45:00]  just call pains in the ass, get out of the effing club.  You're yapping.  You're making a...  Well, you're okay.  You're just making a very difficult time for the comic.  Okay, yeah.  So you had turned around, looked right at me, and pointed at me.  Now, I had been going to comedy clubs for years.  I'm friends with a lot of comics.  I know the protocol. 
[02:45:30]  Right.  Shut the eff up.  Laugh at the funny parts.  Don't try to be the act for the night.  He's up on stage.  You lambasted me.  I did.  As the guy that was making the noise.  And I even tried much...  I didn't have the mic, so I tried.  I was like, no, it's not me.  Shut up.  You laid into me.  And I was sitting there like, it's not me.  I know how to act in a comedy club.  And then everyone's looking at me like I'm the douche. 
[02:46:00]  Hey, you know what?  I hate to be all blackwater about it, but collateral damage.  What can I tell you?  The boys will back me up here.  You know, sometimes...  Collateral damage.  I have to say one thing.  Don't apologize.  Because I saw Jim's special.  And when you two stood up...  It was amazing, wasn't it?  In the sea of seat fillers and people who were promised, if you come to this, you might  get on America's Dancing with the Stars. 
[02:46:30]  You guys are the most blendable people I've ever seen.  Yeah, true.  Because I know now I'm like, yeah, I have seen you at the club.  But you like blend right in.  I know.  I all of a sudden was the A-hole.  No, it actually made for a funny story.  I was just...  I was so pissed that night.  I'm like...  You kept saying, but I was helping him.  I was only helping...  I was in.  I know that's the worst.  I was helping.  I was making the show better.  I know.  He needs someone to work off of.  If you could come...  We all have to pitch together because there's a problem.  And I'm glad you guys are giving me a chance to come on here. 
[02:47:00]  Because we are inundated right now in this city with Europeans with a lot of money that's  worth as much as our money.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  And this hasn't happened since I don't know when.  Maybe the 1800s or something.  There's Canadian people walking around like they have a real country.  There's all these Europeans.  They come down to the comedy cellar and they just stare.  They don't get it.  And then you have to attack them because it brings up your own inner self-hatred.  They're like kind of verifying what you already know.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Are you guys running into that? 
[02:47:30]  The Canadians are feeling pretty important right now.  Yeah.  Their money's worth more than ours at this, right?  For the first time in a long time, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  A hundred dollars worth more than ours?  Yeah.  A little more.  And it's like, when did that happen?  We goofed on their money for years.  I think it's an even Stephen right now.  And the shekel is coming up.  The shekel.  A couple of shekels.  I saw Bill Burr recently.  I got to keep going back to the last time I saw you.  He was taping his latest DVD.  And he's killing, man. 
[02:48:00]  Killing.  It was a big theater downtown.  And remember the guy was completely asleep at your show.  And you're like, what the F is this about?  My whole set, there was this guy, like, I mean, like that, you know, your head wakes you up.  Not even just a little tired.  Doing that.  He's always like, you know.  You know what I find out later?  He was one of the guys in the crowd.  He was on something.  And he was freaking people out.  This is going to be awesome.  And, you know, by the time the show started, he was like passed out.  So, of course, this kid's like right in the third row.  So the entire time, you know, as a comedian, that's all I'm focusing on. 
[02:48:30]  Right.  I'm just like, this DVD is going to put people to sleep.  They're going to nod off.  This is, I suck.  I'm terrible.  Dude, you should have had nothing to do with Bill Burr.  You should have smashed him and said something like, geez, sir, am I keeping you up?  I was like, well, you see the guy who's sleeping and he's like wearing a suit.  So, you know, like he's not like trash or anything or whatever.  And then, like later you find out, it's like, well, I'm sorry.  I say, hey, dude, what's the matter?  Not funny?  Blah, blah, blah.  And then it's like, I run a burn unit.  And, you know, single-handedly saving house, something, lives. 
[02:49:00]  And you're like, oh.  Dude, I was doing it.  I used to do it.  I used to do it.  I think it's Sloan Kettering, the cancer.  Awards.  Here in New York.  That's right.  I want to always try.  The winner of the slowest walk to the bathroom is.  I was, no, I would go there and do these gigs.  They would have Tuesday night, you know, to make the, to cheer the patients up.  And I was doing it one time.  You?  Yeah, I know.  Who was the second choice for that? 
[02:49:30]  Well, I wasn't the only one, but I was one of many.  So I was performing and this one guy was just staring at me the whole time.  And I just kept addressing how this guy hates me and I'm bombing.  So afterwards, he walked over and he's like, I'm sorry, I wasn't laughing.  I'm just not feeling very well.  That's what I'm going to hear.  Great.  And you patted him on the back and he spit up blood?  No, I punched him in the face and I said, I don't want to hear it.  You should have stayed in the room.  You set wrecker?  I really felt bad.  Set wrecker.  Right.  The cancer gig is the gateway to the, telling kids they're adopted. 
[02:50:00]  Well, they wouldn't let me on to the AIDS ward until I proved myself and got a tape.  That's part of your reel.  I'm sad.  I want to see the video of the chick with the.  The butt implants?  Yeah, I felt them before.  Like, certain of them.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  Hookers certainly come to have them and they just feel like, they feel like.  Wait, hookers have butt implants?  I mean, a couple of them, yeah.  You can feel that there's something not right.  I hooked up one time.  Something not right.  Really?  I came back off the road on something alien.  And I felt, I still think this was a post-op tranny. 
[02:50:30]  So we had sex and something felt wrong.  Now, that's not a band, is it?  I always thought that was a band.  Go ahead.  Post-op tranny.  Right after Sweet Charlie.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  Sorry, Jim.  I didn't really have a story to it.  I just kind of felt that there was something wrong.  I could feel like it didn't feel right.  And then the ass, something felt plastic about it.  It was in hindsight that I realized that that was.  Oh, that's odd.  What was she doing as you were realizing she had a fake ass? 
[02:51:00]  Helping me finish.  I didn't stop.  So how do they do, where do they go in for that?  They just go under the cheek?  I don't know, actually.  There's a video.  They do it in Brazil a lot.  Brazil a lot.  Video's up over there.  Really?  Brazil?  They need it?  What is that?  It's a breast implant.  It looks like a.  Oh, my God.  She's got a boob on her butt.  Oh, my God.  How do you explain that?  It's a butt boob.  Are you a big butted guy?  I mean, do you like.  Oh.  What's going on there?  That's her without her pants on.  Stop.  What the F is that? 
[02:51:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to get sick.  I don't know what that is.  How do you explain that?  Rocky Dennis' head.  Rocky Dennis' head.  What is that?  It's Tupperware.  How do you.  What it is?  It's a.  It's a.  How do you explain that?  Seriously.  I can't.  It looks nice.  I can't even figure it out.  Never mind.  Explain it.  I'm looking at it and I can't work out where.  What?  It's a bunion.  It's a bunion.  Wow.  We're.  We don't know how to explain this.  It's like a bike helmet.  It's like a bike helmet under her skin. 
[02:52:00]  There you go.  It's got all my dreams in there.  That is disgusting.  All right.  We'll get that video up later.  Wow.  Hey, let's say hi to Stephen in Canada.  That's a lawsuit.  Stephen.  Hey, brother.  What's going on?  What's going on, man?  What's up?  We got David Tell in studio today.  Oh, that's cool.  And many others.  I'm in Toronto now.  Yep.  I love you guys up here.  A lot of you guys are starting to spread up here.  Yep.  You guys were talking about the Canadian dollar.  Yeah.  It's actually kind of funny, dude, because if you didn't know already, all these Canadians were 
[02:52:30]  all starting to rush down to the states because the way we see it is now  that our dollar is at par, everything's way cheaper down in the states.  So everyone's coming down there.  So it's funny.  These Canadian retailers, they're all scrambling to now start competing with American prices.  Oh.  Thank you for that little economics lesson.  What are they buying?  Bobsleds and Parkers and snowmobiles?  I was just thinking that this show is going.  Canadians are the most polite people.  Are they?  Yeah.  I was thinking this show was going so well that we really needed someone to, like, kick us 
[02:53:00]  in the nuts.  Thank you, Stephen, for that interesting comment.  You know what you need to do, though?  Go on, Stephen.  Go on the internet and look up Rick Mercer's talking to Americans.  I think you'll like it.  Whoa.  What is that about?  Canadian perspective.  Very challenging, Randall.  All right.  I wish we had the money to fight you on this one, but we do.  I'll be able to clean your house later.  All right.  We'll check that out.  Let's say hi to Tim in Missouri.  Tim, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, man?  I just wanted to thank Dave Attell.  I was in Iraq last year, and I saw him on July 31st at Camp Liberty at one of the MWR 
[02:53:30]  sites.  And, you know, we were all going there.  We know how sometimes when the MWR and the USL bring comedians over, it was like, holy  cow, this is really Dave Attell.  There was no skimming down, and we really appreciate everything you did for us.  Well, you know, I don't know what to say, but that was probably the highlight of my  year, definitely, because going over there, you know, I really, I don't know, Jim, I know  you've been over there a couple times, but you really, it's the best shows you can ever 
[02:54:00]  do, and a great time just hanging with you guys, and it's really freaking hot over there,  and I don't know how you do it.  Do you yell at the soldiers for speaking up during that?  Pipe down!  There's two Republican guards screaming, and he's just yelling at the US troops.  Enough with the howitzer, I'm trying to do comedy.  Me and Colin did a show on the back of a flatbed truck for like 35 Army guys that had  just come in from a field, and they just sat there on these like picnic park benches and  watched us, and they were fantastic. 
[02:54:30]  They are the best shows, because the crowds are really happy over there.  Well, Jim, I draw when I'm over there.  I'm looking at two, three, and I'm looking at...  No, but the best part is that, like, you do the show, and then you're going to  and then, like, you know, you jump onto something like a plane or whatever, and then you're  like moving to the next base, and it's cool that you get to do, get to see and, you know,  be a part of, like, it's amazing.  So, thank you very much, man, for coming out, and like I said to all the dudes who I saw  over there, first round's on me, see me in a club, so... 
[02:55:00]  All right.  All right, there you go.  All right, so everyone that just heard that...  Yeah, no, really.  Look at a Tell's calendar, figure out where he was, and say you were there.  Yeah.  I can't believe you guys had the nerve to go over there, because I would never go over  there.  Really, Bill?  Oh, are you kidding me?  Go over to a war zone?  But it's sad that you'll be playing one of us in a movie about going over there.  He's the best-looking one in the room.  I'll do, uh...  I'll play a bass, like, in New Jersey.  I'm not going to go over there and get my bass in Jersey.  I'm not going to go over there and get my head sawed off. 
[02:55:30]  Those guys, you know what?  Bill Burr, live from Fort Monmouth.  Dude, it's like, yeah, I'm not a Marine.  I don't know how to shoot guns, and, you know, my luck, that's what's going to happen.  All of a sudden, something crazy is going to happen.  They protect you, though.  Oh, yeah, I'm sure they do.  As they're flying around.  That would be, like, the one huge offensive where the base you're at, it's this huge secure  base, but it gets completely overrun, and someone hands you a rifle and just goes,  Dude, you got to.  You have to. 
[02:56:00]  And there's Bill Burr in a foxhole just going, What do I do?  How do I get the safety off?  I didn't go to basic.  Then I'm on YouTube, rocking slowly in an orange jumpsuit.  Wouldn't that be amazing?  Somebody reads a manifesto above me.  No.  I'll go to any barracks here in the States.  I thought you were, like, a rough and ready dude, though.  I thought you, like, you know, you jump on that.  Yeah, but I'm also one of those guys.  I have a very realistic perspective of what I'm capable of.  And, yeah, if I haven't gone through basic training.  You don't want any. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah, I mean, yeah.  All right.  Hey, look.  I'm pushing 40.  It's over, man.  I can't handle it.  The heat alone is going to kill me.  The plane we were on actually got hit by mortar.  Oh, cool.  Really?  No.  I was fine.  I took very good care.  It was very safe.  I mean, Bobby was telling me, he was trying to tell me he was over there and somebody,  you know, they had to do these maneuvers and somebody was shooting at him.  It's just like, dude.  I thought he was an Iraqi.  A little fat man.  Well, I'll tell you, getting a buzz on over there ain't easy.  No.  Just got to chuck some Purell, put a little scope in it for flavor. 
[02:57:00]  Hey, let's go to Tom.  For some reason, we have now taken on Canada today.  We got Tom in Toronto.  What's up, Tom?  Oh, I don't know if you're calling for me, but Dave, I think I saw you at the Comedy  Cave in Calgary, but since you guys are picking on us, good Canadians, I just want to give  you the big F to you.  Oh, that's all you got.  All right.  Did he just put a spell on us?  Yeah, some Canadian spell.  All right.  We're all in trouble.  I don't think I've ever been to Calgary.  Have you guys been there?  No. 
[02:57:30]  No.  I've been to Toronto, Montreal.  Toronto, Montreal.  Montreal.  I got a hooker in Vancouver in 1990.  Yeah?  Yeah, my last 80 American dollars went to one girl in the alley doing something to me,  and the other girl was like, for an extra 20, you can pat me bum, and she came over,  she pulled it a bum, and so my last 80 American dollars.  It's great.  That's how Jim...  So you had sex with Oliver.  That's how Jim remembers places he's been, by the way, by the hookers he's had in the city.  It's amazing.  He's got a map.  Right.  Hey, this is David Tell.  I'm the new intern on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:58:00]  Can I do this more cop-like?  Hey, this is David Tell.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  They suck.  It's the best of the worst of the comics on the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the best...  Boo!  The best of the worst of the comedians of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Just hilarious.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Really funny.  Really awful, too, by the way.  I'll acknowledge that. 
[02:58:30]  Holy mother of God.  Now presenting comedian...  Doug Stanhope.  How many dwarfs can you fight off before you get tired?  That is the question we asked today.  Yeah.  And, you know, someone that might have an answer is Doug Stanhope, because he likes the drugs.  Doug.  Doug would start smoking them.  Hey, Doug.  Here's the deal.  Hey, Doug.  We're going to start with this.  We just found out that Tyra Banks did her show on primordial dwarfs.  You ever see these things?  That colored girl, right?  Yeah.  You ever see these things, primordial dwarfs? 
[02:59:00]  No.  No.  They look like progeria kids.  You ever see a progeria kid?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That aging disease?  Yeah.  They look like them, only they're about two feet tall.  They are freakish, alien-looking things.  Yeah, they're very, like, they're squishy.  Like, they look like their parts are squished in a little bit.  Like those twisty cats?  What's a twisty cat? 
[02:59:30]  Twisty cat was, like, a big news story several years ago, where this woman was breeding these cats that didn't have front paws.  The bones were missing from the front paws.  They were genetic defects that she was purposely breeding, and they hopped like kangaroos on their back feet, missing bones.  Oh, how great is that?  How cute.  And why was she doing this?  She thought they were adorable.  I'm looking at twisty cats.  Quick Google, and there you go.  You can look at twisty cats thanks to Doug Stano. 
[03:00:00]  See?  And what?  They hopped?  Primordial dwarfs.  Oh, go to primordial dwarf in your Google search.  Yeah, yeah.  Take a look at one of these.  You've never seen anything more rapable than a primordial dwarf.  I'm obsessed with the fucking one.  You're not the only people with Google in this town.  Please hold.  Please hold.  Doug's throwing in primordial dwarf in the old Google search.  Yeah, we're not getting good pictures of them, though. 
[03:00:30]  Nah, we got to get the ones that Maury Povich gets.  See, Tyra's primordial dwarf special.  Go to that one.  Oh, yeah.  Primordial.  I must have misspelled.  I got Dave Mordal.  That's different.  All right.  All right.  There you go.  The first one.  E-Rock.  Up there.  I think you found one.  You found it?  Yeah, I found him.  All right.  Listen, Doug, we do this thing.  We do this thing on Monday.  It's called Pod Talk Monday.  So today, here's the thought. 
[03:01:00]  Primordial dwarfs.  They're coming at you.  How many can you fight off before you get too tired and you lose the battle?  And here's the deal.  Do I have a pool cue?  Huh?  Do I have a pool cue?  Pool cue?  You could use whatever the fuck you want.  But they keep on coming.  There's not like a certain amount.  Like, it's not like you against 10,000.  They just keep coming.  When do you finally lose the battle with the primordial dwarfs?  You know what?  I can't imagine them actually, like, once they gut to you, like, how would they?  I can only imagine them, like, giving you, like, slobbery hickeys or something. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, but just basically imagine biting and punching and kicking you.  Now, they'd be easy to kick away, I think.  But if they're all coming at you from all angles, you'd have to start helicoptering a few around, I think.  One of us.  One of us.  Freak.  All right.  Yeah.  So we're talking about primordial dwarfs and twisty cats today with Doug Stanhope. 
[03:02:00]  What's up, Doug?  Hey, good morning.  Yeah.  I've got my fake I'm awake voice on.  Yeah.  So do we.  Are you in New Mexico?  Yeah, Arizona.  I'm at home.  Okay.  Also, it's pretty early.  Yeah, yeah.  So we're on Dirty Talk O&A?  Yeah, this is filthy language radio.  It's good old filthy talk.  Fantastic.  Yeah.  Hey, we had Chris Hansen on. 
[03:02:30]  We were trying to get a hold of you, but it didn't work out, unfortunately.  Yeah, that was Wednesday.  I have these Wednesday drunk dial nights now because I got Last Comic Standing followed by Chris Hansen.  So it's like this double whammy of hate.  I drink through it, and then I just, I try to blog, but I can't spell.  So I just call people and go, you might not believe this shit, god damn it.  Yeah.  You don't like Chris Hansen?  Oh, no, that guy's just self-important fucking douchehole. 
[03:03:00]  Self-important douche.  Oh, yeah, he's awful.  That show just fucking kills me.  It's worse fear-mongering than even terrorism because parents get so into that.  Oh, well, if you watch that show, you'll see that these pedophiles are more of a problem.  Yeah, if your kid's sitting online going, hi, yeah, hi, random 55-year-old dude I've never met.  My name's Brittany.  I'm rubbing baby oil on myself by the pool. 
[03:03:30]  God, I wish I had a wine cooler.  I live at 125 Washington Avenue.  Christ, I wish you'd just stop by.  Yeah, if you make yourself a pedophile's wet dream.  Yeah, it's such fucking horrible entrapment.  I don't think, Doug, Doug, entrapment, though, is like, come on, if you're getting somebody to, like, approach you as a pedophile,  it's almost like you can't trick a non-pedophile into trying to fucking a 13-year-old.  Well, maybe you can. 
[03:04:00]  First of all, fucking pedophile means someone who wants to fuck prepubescent kids.  Like, when you get a fucking hot chick like they have on there, and they, you know.  Well, you know what?  Can I jump in?  Patrice O'Neal was in, and he kind of made the point that they're making these girls, these decoys, just short of fuckable.  And Patrice is like, if you really want to do this, why don't you do it with 10 and 9-year-olds?  But they're trying to kind of, they're kind of, like, tapping into the, I hate to say it, sort of the hotness of the whole thing, 
[03:04:30]  that it's a 13, it's a 14, it's in that weird age.  Don't apologize for it.  Don't apologize for it.  Were you 14 once?  Did you want to fuck?  Okay, then.  Right.  Did you know what you were doing?  Yes, you did.  Basically, what Patrice was saying, you know, they know exactly what they're doing by using that weird age there, you know.  I mean, if they really did it with, like, 8- and 9-year-olds, it would be so creepy.  No one would watch in that fucking show.  Yeah, then you would just want to, like, shoot the guy when he walks in the door. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah.  Then you'd have a serious problem.  Still wrong, obviously.  I don't want to be jumping on the radio saying that, you know, I'm condoning this.  But, I mean, I think Patrice made a pretty interesting point, you know, because if you really want to take care of this problem, you know, set it up with 8- or 9-year-olds.  Well, but do they, do predators really catch 8- or 9-year-olds?  I think most pedophiles or whatever probably don't go after 8- or 9-year-olds online because the communication skills aren't there.  Like, a 12- or 13-year-old can sneak out, meet you somewhere, have a relationship online. 
[03:05:30]  I don't think an 8- or 9-year-old can.  I mean, it's...  They've got to be taken from the house.  Yeah, I think most times you've got to meet them.  And most pedophiles or most victims of pedophilia, they know they're an attacker.  You know, it's a family member.  It's not someone they met online.  Because, again, you don't...  If you teach your kids even the most basic skills, we grew up without the Internet, and there were just as many pedophiles.  We just didn't have the Internet.  And your parents dealt with it by talking to you. 
[03:06:00]  They'd go, hey, don't talk to strangers.  Some of them might want to fuck you.  And you go, thanks, Dad.  I'm going to log that information in my brain, and that's why you didn't, you know, get fucked by a stranger.  That's why you got fucked by your uncle.  They never said don't talk to your uncle.  Well, if you have just the most minimal parenting, you're not going to do that online.  But it's also hard...  Go ahead.  Go ahead, ma'am.  Go ahead.  I was going to say it's also hard because it's like online you really think you're talking to a 13-year-old.  In person, you know you're talking to a strange adult. 
[03:06:30]  Like, they'll say don't go up to strangers, but you kind of know.  Your parents never say to you when you're a kid, never talk to somebody else your age who's a stranger.  They encourage you to make friends.  So it's like online, it's a little bit different because you a lot of times think you're talking to somebody who's 12 or 13, but you're really talking to a guy who's 50.  That's the difference is the anonymity typically you don't have in person that you have online.  I would love to do a reverse thing with like a 35-year-old woman saying, God, I really want to get laid by a 14-year-old boy and just bust all the sea of 14-year-old boys who show up and bust them old kids. 
[03:07:00]  Shove their dicks out.  You just touch their penises with lit match heads and say, dirty boy!  And then watch what happens to them in 20 years.  It's such a double standard, though, man.  I mean, you know, women sleeping with boys of 14 or 15, we barely blink when those stories hit the paper. 
[03:07:30]  Hey, by the way, Squeaky Wheel writes, Hanson explained that it's not entrapment because they do not approach the pedos.  The pedos reach out to the plants unprovoked.  He did make that point on our show.  But even if they didn't, even if they didn't, you couldn't entrap me into having sex with a 10- or 11-year-old.  You just couldn't do it because it's not what I want to do.  Like, I always kind of believe in entrapment, but in a way I don't.  Like, eh, if you're going to do it, man, you're going to do it.  Yeah.  It's like if they put dope on the table.  As a weak analogy, but if they put a $100 bill on a bus bench and if they've vilified C's as much as they do pedophiles, they go, oh, this person, they pocketed the $100 bill. 
[03:08:00]  Well, all right, if you're going to wave it around like that, you're going to get takers.  But don't act like it's this epidemic that it's not.  Well, I'll tell you, the thing is, though, like, with $100 – I mean, I know you acknowledge a $100 bill is kind of an odd thing, but it's like, you know, $100 is something anybody can use. 
[03:08:30]  Fucking a child is something only a small percentage of the population comprehends.  Most of us don't, like, work 40 hours a week to fuck a child.  I said most of us.  You know, occasionally it's a fun thing and a stress relief.  Who am I to judge?  And I know this borders on a Nambla argument, but at what point are you an adult?  Nature gives you the ability to bear children, to be a parent at roughly 13 years old.  And the government says you're not even ready to drink a beer until you're 21. 
[03:09:00]  Like, at what point is it bullshit?  Like, naturally, you don't want to fuck someone way out of your age range.  That's natural.  I don't want to fuck a 15-year-old for the same reason I don't want to fuck a 70-year-old.  I have nothing to say to them, you know?  I'll take the 15-year-old over the 70-year-old.  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, Reverend writes from North Carolina, just tell Doug to shut up and view it as entertainment.  I think even NBC would admit that it's gotten past the awareness stage with this show. 
[03:09:30]  But it does probably scare pedophiles, though.  I guarantee you that that has changed the way they do things.  I guarantee you there's less guys doing it because they're like, fuck that, man.  You can talk, but you can't go over.  At least less guys doing it that way.  Yeah.  Hey, Doug.  That's a big way to do it.  Find a nice new way.  Doug, you got that computer.  Go to break.com and type in to catch a Chris Hansen.  He came in, and Anthony did Chris Hansen to Chris Hansen.  It was really, really funny.  Really good.  You're going to want to check that out.  Oh, by the way, I just got to acknowledge something. 
[03:10:00]  I didn't intentionally try to steal a Ron Bennington bit, so relax.  About what?  Fighting things.  People are just getting, you know.  Oh, relax.  I wouldn't try to just casually steal a Ron bit.  We traded that bit for Big A and Stalker Patty.  There you go.  I'm the one that mentioned that, not Ope, and I've never heard Ron Bennington do that bit.  I mentioned I could beat up 10,000 of them. 
[03:10:30]  Ron talks about beating up kids.  Oh, really?  Okay.  Or animals.  I love Ron.  It's like, how would you fight a giraffe?  You got to choke him.  Big neck.  You can't punch him in the face.  It's too high.  So Ron's got his logic on how to beat things up.  But we're talking about primordial dwarves, and you know.  And they just keep coming like the Matrix.  Matrix, too.  So whatever, dude.  I didn't try to steal a Ron bit, so let's do it.  Relax.  Exactly.  You'll hear about this all in my gym-itorial.  Yes. 
[03:11:00]  Give the gym-itorial.  What, Doug?  I'm sorry, man.  I had to free up the instant feedback there, Doug, because they're writing in like crazy.  And I want to get some Doug Stanhope instant feedback going here.  That's all right.  I just didn't know if that was one of the characteristics of these primordial dwarves, was they attack in droves.  No, I think there's only, someone is reminding us there's only 80 in the world, so.  80 in the world.  So I guess, unfortunately, it would be a very, very short battle.  An extremely short battle.  That sucks to be them. 
[03:11:30]  They must be worth money.  Yeah, that's a collector's item.  I thought it, though.  Only 80.  Stuff them.  If you could make them, like, what was that book where they created freaks?  Come on.  It's a famous book.  I shouldn't try to think at this hour.  The Bible?  Gulliver's Travels?  Oh, no.  Never mind.  Harry Potter?  Creating freaks?  Frankenstein?  Don't make fun of, excuse me.  Don't make fun of Harry Potter.  Oh, I'm sorry, Jim. 
[03:12:00]  Don't make fun of Harry Potter.  The message board people don't like when you make fun of Harry Potter.  No.  Bunch of fruits.  No, no, no, no, no.  That's good reading, and if you make fun of him, you're jealous.  Hey, Jason from Rye.  Shut up.  Look up their ass.  Well, no, hold on.  Before we get into butters, this is why I wanted to free up the instant feedback, because I  know people keep close tabs on you, Doug.  Jason from Rye, he writes, here you go, just asked Doug about his discovery of male urethra  fingering. 
[03:12:30]  Oh, cock fingering.  All right.  Okay, don't even.  Come on, let's go.  What do you got?  No fucking way.  What do you got?  Dude.  Ow.  Doug, what?  You've never seen cock fingering?  No.  No.  I got to grab my cock now and squeeze it.  Explain cock fingering.  Oh, it's just a random porn I've come across.  It's digits in the male urethra.  And autism.  Come on, you've seen this stuff.  Wait, wait, wait.  It's like little wrenches in his urethra. 
[03:13:00]  I could understand maybe like a pencil tip or something, but you're talking fingers in  there?  Oh, nothing.  You've never, come on.  It hurts getting a little shampoo in there if you're jacking off with it.  Dude.  A little soap.  I'm just saying this.  You have to take a leak and it's like, ah, what happened?  Wait, explain, Doug.  Come on.  I swear I haven't seen this stuff.  The guy's referring to a bit that's like a seven minute chunk of material that I'm not  going to just bust into. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, okay.  No, we don't need your bit.  We just like talking to you.  I've used it as an example of like weird porn.  Again, it's in the whole child pornography vein where they go, child pornography is rampant  on the internet.  And like, why don't I ever see it?  But I've seen cock fingering.  Like I have a, if you go to my message board, there's a thread called the tsunami of poon  where people just post like the most horrible pornography they can find. 
[03:14:00]  And I've seen like, yeah, there's just stuff shoved down the cock hole.  I've seen several times.  I've seen it just wandering the internet, just clicking on.  Oh, I used to see a dominatrix and she would, uh, you know, whatever, old toilet games.  But she was talking about a doctor she used to see.  And what he likes her to do was take a scalpel and put the scalpel in the tip of his cock  and just hold it there and then yank it out.  Like not dig deep with it, but just put the blade in and go and yank the scalpel up. 
[03:14:30]  And she said the thrill for this doctor, because he knew it wouldn't permanently damage him,  was that when he'd pee like for the next couple of days, he would feel it and remember that  domination.  Feel it.  And was talking about it.  Like we've all like masturbated with shampoo and shit and something happens where like  a little gets in your pee hole.  It hurts.  And then all of a sudden you have to take a leak like an hour or two later and it burns, man.  Stings.  What is that about, by the way?  I don't know.  The inside of your fucking dick hole ain't meant for any fucking nothing. 
[03:15:00]  I don't know.  Let's go to Dr. Sanjay Gupta on line six.  Sanjay Gupta.  My friend Zul, he was this biker comic dog.  He was really funny.  He was just a fucking animal.  But he was so dirty and he had this one joke.  Hey, don't you hate when you're taking a bath and you get a little soap in your pee hole  and then mommy has to come and suck it out?  He was such a fucking savage on stage.  By the way, Jason from Rye is apologizing to you, dog. 
[03:15:30]  He didn't want you to launch into the bed.  He's a big fan, but he just figured it was worth discussing.  So what stuff have you seen this guy shoving his pee hole?  It's not this guy.  This is like a whole theme of porn.  It's just a thing.  You've heard of docking, right?  I mean, you've seen the guys with like the split cocks.  They've like pierced them so many times.  They've come in two.  I've seen the split cock.  I don't understand what's going on in your brain to do that. 
[03:16:00]  You slice it right down the middle.  Show the split cock.  What the hell is this?  I'm sure everything is just a slippery path, you know?  Hey, why don't you tickle my asshole a little?  And the next thing you know, you're the goatsy guy.  All right, look.  We're looking at the mistress use their, the mistresses use their restrained slave and forcibly insert things into his urethra.  Oh.  These mistresses are cruel bitches for sure. 
[03:16:30]  And what is she shoving in there?  I don't know.  Like a nail or something?  It's a long metal thing.  Just a thing.  I'm getting woozy thinking about it.  Dude, I don't understand.  They do CBT cock and ball torture.  I don't get it.  Like there's guys that want to be tortured.  There are guys that lay down, yeah, and girls with high heels.  Yeah, high heels on the testicle.  Just heel the shit.  Right on the testicle.  Right on the nut.  Not just the bag, right on the testicle?  Oh my God.  And the dick and everything and just stomp it. 
[03:17:00]  Sometimes if my dick is struggling, my girlfriend will slap the back of it a little bit like this.  Like, not really hard.  But it just kind of jump starts.  Like, my dick's like, oh, all right.  Yeah, all right.  It's time to go here.  When you're coked up.  When you're coked up.  Does that work?  That helps quite a bit, yeah.  Yeah, a little rough necking.  Come on.  And you've heard of the docking, right?  I read it in a fetish book back in the day.  Back in the day where you had to read to get pornography?  No, there was like a...  Remember that book, Ann? 
[03:17:30]  We used to read out of that back at AF back in the day.  They talked about all these weird fetishes like axilism, which is...  Was that the armpit?  Yeah, having sex with an armpit.  I still remember some of these.  And the one was docking where you touch helmets and the other guy is uncircumcised  and he takes his skin and...  Rolls it over.  Rolls it over yours and then you...  You're docked.  You're docked.  We have space dock.  You masturbate that way.  I got a nice bit out of that. 
[03:18:00]  It'll keep you warm.  Yeah.  I guess you just crank it from where they're like joined and hold it together  and jack it that way and what, shoot into...  I...  I...  I...  Whatever.  I don't know.  Hey, let's go to Jason in Minnesota.  Jason, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I used to be into that thing where I could stick things into my pee hole and masturbate with.  It felt good.  I had like a metal kind of rod I would do it with. 
[03:18:30]  And this was, you know, a couple years ago.  And one day, I couldn't find it.  And I was looking around my bedroom for things that, you know, of the same size and orientation I could use.  And I stumbled upon, you know, like when you're, you know, when you're horny, you're just looking for anything, you know.  No, I don't know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I found the dripping of wax on the side of a candle.  Like I had lit a candle and, you know, wax had dripped down the side and I broke it off.  And I thought, wow, this is exactly what I need. 
[03:19:00]  So I was using that to, uh, to jack off of it.  He actually said it too.  He goes, wow, this is exactly what I need.  Why am I speaking out loud?  Go ahead.  Dude, you know, when you're younger and getting boners all the time and you just need to, you know, get rid of the poison, he'll do just about anything.  But I left my pee hole alone.  All left to the outside.  Right.  Dude, if you said that's exactly what I need, you should have been looking at a psychotherapist.  My brother kind of showed me how, when we were little, he kind of turned me on to it. 
[03:19:30]  But anyway, a piece of that candlelight broke off inside and I couldn't get it out.  And I guess it kind of warmed up inside my body and kind of melted.  I had to, I just freaked out and I had to go to the hospital and get it removed.  How'd they remove you?  Are they using like a rolling pin?  No, it was a, it was an inpatient procedure.  I was, I was there for two days while it healed and, and, and.  Two days?  Did they cut it open? 
[03:20:00]  Yeah, I had to cut it open and then scrape all the wax out.  Now I got this neat little scar.  What's the matter with you?  That's, that's, I don't get the pee hole.  Why don't you cut the malarkey already?  Just fucking hollow out something and fuck it like the rest of us do.  Yeah.  Okay.  Thanks, Jason.  Hey, uh, Travis from Kansas.  I've seen a video of a dildo in the pee hole.  It's life changing.  A dildo?  All right, now, see, Doug, now we're on to something here.  From cock fingering to cock fucking.  And that's something I haven't even seen.  Well, let's.  Oh, man, that would be something. 
[03:20:30]  Two guys, one is fucking the other guy's pee hole.  How does it feel?  What's the biggest thing you could take in your pee hole before you say, hey, hey, I'm tapping out?  A whisker.  Me, personally?  What's my record?  I'm the old setup man.  I set up the pins.  The amazing, the most disturbing porno I've ever watched video was the amazing Thai pee hole gang bang.  Uh, where she actually has a speculum in her urethra, where guys, guys bang her. 
[03:21:00]  And, you know, they get close-ups.  You see the difference.  Get the fuck out of here.  They're banging her piss hole.  Cum bubbles, it's actually, that's what I remember from the back of the box was the description of how she blows cum bubbles from her bladder.  And it was written in a way that's supposed to be a turn-on.  It was supposed to be a turn-on.  Oh, my God. 
[03:21:30]  The amazing Thai.  Hey, uh, sorry, go ahead, Doug.  Oh, no, I was just going to tout her performance.  She's got bowling pins in her and shit.  I'm a little distracted because we got fucked.  That guy with the candle wax story, that's in a book.  Brian in Atlanta, what's up?  Yeah, man, that's a Chuck Palahniuk story.  It's in this book called Haunted by Chuck Palahniuk.  It's, like, completely made up.  That motherfucker got us.  Hey, you know what?  That was the first Chuck Palahniuk book I threw away, by the way. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah, yeah, I had made it all the way through.  But, uh, no, I mean.  You know what?  Do yourself a favor, man.  If you got haunted and you're struggling through it, just throw it away.  And find another book to read.  And I love Chuck Palahniuk.  I couldn't get through that one.  I don't know who he is.  Fight Club.  Fight Club.  Ah.  Yeah.  All his books are really interesting.  Oh, I don't go for that type.  But Haunted was the first one.  I just couldn't.  Ugh, I hated it.  Dave in New York, what's up? 
[03:22:30]  Hey, what's going on?  You guys missed the sickest fucking thing there is.  Oh, sorry.  Um, ball enlargement where those guys inject, like, a needle into their balls and they just  pump them up with, like, silicone or, like, saline solution.  Their sack ends up getting to be as big as a freaking grapefruit.  It's called body modification.  It's, uh, they fill it, yeah, really bizarre stuff.  They fill their cocks.  And I saw a documentary of these guys.  And the one guy was just talking.  And he said that he had a tattoo.  He had, like, uh, he did something with his dick, so now he has to piss through a hole. 
[03:23:00]  Like, he doesn't piss through his dick.  The piss doesn't make it to the head of his dick.  He pisses, like, right above his balls.  And he had flames put around it.  And he goes, I have to pith to put the fire out.  I have to pith to put the fire out.  This guy should just be shot.  Ew.  Why are you alive, sir?  Where did you find this documentary?  My friend John Mazzarek had it.  He was a guy who worked at Port Newark.  Look at that.  BMEzine.com.  Body modification e-zine.  They have everything you could possibly want to see on there. 
[03:23:30]  It's a free site.  BMEzine.  Zine.com?  Yep.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Dave in New York.  Thanks.  All right.  And does your ball stay that big?  Yes.  Or does the liquid get kind of just soaked into your body and go away?  No, no.  I think they do stay big.  Apparently, I've heard the trannies in Brazil use it, too, to make their dicks bigger.  I've heard people use it on their bodies for all kinds of weird reasons to make their balls.  Your dick and balls or just balls?  I guess it depends on what you want to do with it.  I've seen the documentary.  He had this documentary because somebody at Port Newark that he knew did body modification. 
[03:24:00]  And what the guys will do, and Stanhope has probably seen this, is guys will slice the back of their cock open with a razor like a banana.  And they open it up, and it heals, and they put studs on the inside, and they tattoo the inside.  It's really fucking...  It probably is uncomfortable.  I can't even.  Go to the world...  I can't even.  Hold on.  E-Rock, November 10, 2006.  World record attempts.  What are we looking at here?  What is this?  What is the world record attempts from this BME... 
[03:24:30]  Zine.com?  What is this?  Suspension.  From his back?  Yeah.  This guy breaks record for most hooks in his back.  Yeah, I've seen that.  Okay, all right.  Old hat.  So, new record from Russia.  What world record did Russia set?  1,500 needles for one hour?  What's that?  Most disconnected stripper.  1,500 needles in his...  What is that?  In his arm.  Oh, that's in his arm.  Oh.  Holy shit. 
[03:25:00]  1,500 needles in one arm.  What happened?  Did somebody get the 1,498 and just bail out?  I'm going to 15.  That probably hurts.  All right.  See, Doug, look, you never disappoint.  The phones are lit now.  Let's go to Steve in Redback.  Steve, what's up?  I just want to let you guys know there's this fantastic little video I saw of this guy  inserting a AA battery into his cock hole and then firing it out like a little missile.  Oh.  If you could fire it out, well, then you'd have some incentive to do that. 
[03:25:30]  What the fuck?  Like a weapon.  We're just getting bored sexually, man.  I think we've done everything we possibly can.  What the fuck are you doing that?  So now we're just, like, making up shit.  Your piss hole is, like, one of the most sensitive areas on your body.  Never, never, never.  That dick and balls is just set up for very minimal things.  Pissing, fucking, getting jerked, the balls getting juggled around a little bit.  And making bat wings. 
[03:26:00]  Bat wings are fine.  Don't forget bat wings.  That's it.  Airplane.  Airplane.  Docking.  Airplane's fine.  You ever take that?  Take the loose skin around the side of your wiener and pull them out like wings and go,  make him turn.  What, are you trying to get a kid to suck it?  Open up.  Here comes the plane.  Fucking creep.  What's the matter with you?  Do you ever make your dick disappear?  Yes.  Inside the mouth of an invalid. 
[03:26:30]  As they're laying there going,  That sucker will push inward if you do it right.  No way.  Oh, yeah.  There's no way I could get my dick to push in me.  Well, maybe you couldn't as a fucking giant fat cock.  Love having a big fat cock.  Big fat hiney wrecker you're walking around with.  Let's go to Mark in Houston.  I need wrecker.  And we got a split cock guy standing by, but first Mark in Houston.  Mark, what's up? 
[03:27:00]  Yeah, hey.  My ex-wife used to do a thing.  She would call it a dick queef.  She would do it.  She would blow into my piss hole.  And when she moved her mouth away, she'd stick her thumb over it and let it out.  It would fart kind of like a pussy queef.  Sounds like an enchanting relationship.  Kind of neat.  Like, that doesn't seem possible.  No, it felt kind of neat, actually.  Doesn't seem possible, but how many guys are going to try this now?  There's a few out there.  There's a few. 
[03:27:30]  We want a recording of that.  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks, sir.  That'll be high pitch.  Yeah, let's go to Greg in Cleveland.  Greg, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I knew this woman who used to work in an emergency room back before Viagra and everything, and  they had some, like, 80-year-old man come in there one time complaining, and he had eight  pipe cleaners shoved in there trying to keep it hard.  What?  Pipe cleaners.  You can bend it into different shapes.  Poor old fella. 
[03:28:00]  Poor old codger.  Poor guy.  All right, let's talk to Rob from North Carolina.  Rob, what's up?  What do you got?  Hey, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  You actually have a sub-incision, which is the split cock.  What's your call, buddy?  No, I actually have a split cock.  Oh.  Why?  Why?  It's awesome.  Why?  Well, why?  It's hard to explain.  I actually do the sounding, the shoving metal things in there and stuff, and if you split  up a little bit, you can fit more in.  Oh, logic, of course.  Well, Rob, you're not explaining why.  Like, you're talking to a lot of guys right now, and how does it get to a point where 
[03:28:30]  you decide, how do you get to a point where you decide, I want to split cock?  I've seen a few pictures of the split cock, and not even a thought of ever attempting this.  No.  Yeah, I had a lot of gentle piercings.  I used to be a piercer for about four years.  I do sideshow performance now, and I've just seen a lot of guys.  Just figured it'd be cool to do, and I did it, and I really enjoyed it, so.  How'd you do it?  How'd you split your cock?  It's an underground surgeon type of guy.  And it's just a scalpel. 
[03:29:00]  You cut, and you sew the sides together, and it splits.  How much does that hurt?  I get to see three people just to get a Xanax prescription.  Body modification people.  And it goes, cut, and you're just joking half like it.  That's funny, man.  You know, that's a tough one to write off on fucking insurances and medical necessity.  I had to get my dick split.  Do you have to use a rubber...  It's going to be weird to have, like, some kind of fetish or whatever like that, that  even me and Norton go, I don't get it. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah, what the fuck?  I can see a little log in the mouth.  How do you fuck with a split dick?  You carry around rubber bands?  So, you know, I still get hard, still normal, but it's not tipped like in the end.  It's sort of...  Hold on, dude, but when it gets hard, what the fuck's going on?  It's split.  Oh, no, it's not split all the way.  So it still gets hard, like a hot dog in a microwave type of thing.  Yeah, but what about the tip?  Like, that doesn't get hard, right?  Don't you feel it?  Yeah, blood flow still goes there.  And aren't you worried that right now it's... 
[03:30:00]  It smells like a moray eel.  Well, I'm thinking if it's split already and you're having sex, aren't you worried that  the damn thing's going to tear?  No, not really.  I mean, it's fully healed up, so...  We've all, you know, we've all went for that piece of skin on the side of our nail and  decided, oh, I could take this off.  Next thing you know, you've got a long red strip all the way down to your elbow.  Ow.  Ow.  I'm just thinking, having a lot of sex with a split cock, you know, it's got to tear. 
[03:30:30]  Well, also, sex feels a lot better because your urethra, yeah, it's real sensitive, so  sex just feels a lot better for me as well.  I love that.  Sex feels better.  Sex is great the way it is.  I don't have to chop my cock in two.  Rob, we're really trying to get into your brain here, though.  Chris on Long Island, he asked, and we asked, and you're still not helping us out here.  He goes, what makes people do this?  Like, all right, there's a ton of people that do piercings.  Yeah.  Just one step further.  That's more than one.  People are trying to get a ton of slippery slope. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah.  It's almost a slippery slope theory.  I mean, I'm not going to split it anymore.  I mean, I like where it is now.  But it's just something different, and I really enjoyed it, so good thing.  It's almost like cutting your dick off, or, like, wanting to cut your dick off, almost.  Yeah, you have a vein.  I know people who have it done, yeah.  Dude, you have a vein in your dick, right?  Well, there's people that are into that, too.  I'm not into that.  Yes.  Yeah, we did the amputee fetish on the show.  It was hilarious.  Wait, sir, let me ask you.  This I don't get.  Like, you know how when you come and you piss, there's a hole?  There's, like, the urethra.  How do you avoid splitting that? 
[03:31:30]  Like, how do you know you're not going to cut it like a straw?  Oh, no, no.  The urethra is split.  Do you cum like a blender bus?  Well, no, you know, I cum.  All right, so let's...  I guess I'm going to be dropping sex up, so...  Girl, girl gives me pleasure with her mouth.  You could say whatever you want.  She gives you a fucking blowjob.  Exactly.  Give me a fucking blowjob.  You know, I cum.  Fucking cum on the chin.  She doesn't have to swallow.  It just hits her face automatically.  Because the shoot, the actual hole's near the base, near the balls. 
[03:32:00]  Somewhat.  So it actually...  The hole?  So you did it to be a gentleman.  A gentleman.  You cum out of the hole that's kind of near your balls?  Oh, no, no.  I mean, the urethra goes all the way in.  So it's on the urethra.  I'm still at work.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But when you shoot, you're shooting, like, halfway down your dick.  Yeah, pretty much.  That's fucked up right there.  She must look like she's wearing a scuba regulator. 
[03:32:30]  Sucking both halves of your cock, going over her teeth one way and the other.  She's in the middle going, what do you want from me?  What do you guys want to have you?  All right, there.  Thanks, Rob.  I'll show you guys suits.  I'll show it to you.  You guys can...  Oh, great.  I can't wait.  I can't wait.  Thanks.  You guys can't wait.  All right.  Let's say hi to Marcus in Asheville.  Marcus, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, kid, Bootsy.  What's up, dude? 
[03:33:00]  Hey, when I was a kid growing up, there was this religious family that lived across the  street, right?  And so, anyway, this kid was in the bathtub, and he kept pushing his penis in and kept  pushing it in and kept pushing it in.  Anyway, the little thing didn't come out, and the mom had to go in, and she tried pulling  it and tried getting it out.  So, anyway, he ended up at the hospital, and they had tweezers trying to go pick this  thing out, man.  But it's pretty crazy.  So, you can push it in, but it could also get stuck, we're learning today. 
[03:33:30]  As a kid, maybe.  She should have put her mouth over it and, like, given some suction, and that probably  would have popped it back out.  Well, she should have put things in his asshole and pushed them in and out really quickly.  Happened.  A fucking screwdriver and a hammer.  Flicked his nipple, showed him tinkle videos, so his little weenie just popped out naturally.  So, Doug, how's Butters?  I just see him on my message board.  I don't go out when I'm in town.  But he sends me emails saying he wants to come over and make us tamales, and I don't write 
[03:34:00]  back.  So, you're not hanging with Butters these days, huh?  Yeah, Butters doesn't understand.  I don't really have much to say to 20-year-old kids that are standing in the closet, banging  on the door.  That's true.  Butters is peeking at a cock through the fucking letter slot door, and he's sticking his tongue  out, and he can almost get the piss slip, but not quite. 
[03:34:30]  All right.  Doug, so I'm hearing good things about your Showtime special.  Oh, yeah.  Congratulations, man.  Oh, thanks, man.  Yeah, it looks like shit.  It's edited weird, but the jokes are the jokes.  Who cares about the lighting?  You comedians are never happy how they film stuff for you.  Looks like shit, edited like shit.  But the jokes are good. 
[03:35:00]  They keep doing cutaways to my cigarette or my beer.  That makes it crazy.  That's artsy, man.  I wish I knew how to do shit like that.  I'd do it myself.  The funniest thing ever, the virus tour when Otto and George were up, and they'd do a  complete isolation face shot on Otto as he's talking for George.  You know, Otto's not the best ventriloquist when it comes to not moving his mouth. 
[03:35:30]  So they would show him, and he's talking like George, but they're not even showing the puppet.  Louis C.K. said it just looks like an angry porno movie.  He's just yelling at himself.  Or I hate when they just show the puppet.  They should just show fucking Otto and George.  Yeah.  So if it's two of them.  Yeah, exactly.  Come on.  We go to meatspin.com, of course.  We got a woman fucking a guy's pisshole with a dildo.  Go to meatspin.com, Eric.  Whoever goes to meatspin voluntarily. 
[03:36:00]  It's E-Rock's job.  Where is it?  All right, so don't send people with fake links.  Email me a link to that one.  That's...  Ha ha ha.  Hawk fucking strap on.  There he is.  See, it's the guy on the cover.  He's getting fucked in the ass, and his dick is spinning around.  The guy is a fucking...  It's a girl.  It's a tranny.  It's a guy, though.  Oh, because of the tan lines?  You could tell it's a tranny?  No.  Wow, we got duped again. 
[03:36:30]  I know.  I can't believe that's my favorite site.  I always get duped when I get there.  I get duped into jerking off.  Go to fingerslam.com.  Fingerslam.  You don't want to go to meatspin.  You never want to go to meatspin.  Well, if you want to see a spinning meat...  Oh, God damn it!  What's going on there?  Damn it!  What is that?  It looks like a...  Doug, go right to fingerslam.com.  Damn it!  Fingerslam. 
[03:37:00]  Oh, my God!  Oh, my...  It's kind of like SummerSlam, except the girl's fingering a guy's dick hole.  Oh, shit.  Two fucking fingers.  Two fingers in his...  Yeah.  Are you talking business?  That guy...  That guy sounds like the caller we just had on the air, where his dick is split just enough  where a girl could do this.  Oh, my God.  That, uh...  There's your showstopper today.  That guy's a huge hog, too.  She's holding it in one hand. 
[03:37:30]  There's, like, a foot sticking out, and she's fingering...  The whole thing's fucking...  You better have a huge one.  Yeah.  Finger slam.  I gotta spread this around.  What do your fingers smell like when you're done with that?  I hope she, uh...  I hope she, like, cut her nails beforehand.  Man busted trying to build a nuke reactor with smoke detectors.  Did the thing go up in his face, or does he have bad acne?  Well, I think the radiation might have gotten to him.  Radioactive Boy Scout. 
[03:38:00]  David Allen.  In charge of, uh...  Stealing 16 smoke detectors.  I know there's some radioactive part in the smoke detectors, but, uh...  How much would you need...  To make your face look like that?  ...to make some kind of a reactor?  Man, that guy...  He looks like Than with measles.  Wow, that guy got fucked up.  Yeah.  Cool.  Mmm.  He's gonna grow, and his hair's gonna fall out.  Urgh.  All right, let's go to...  50-foot man.  Be able to put a whole chick up your dick hole. 
[03:38:30]  Hey, let's go to Brian in Jersey.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I saw a video of just a girl jamming her two fingers, her middle finger and index finger,  up the b-hole, so...  That's what we're looking at right now.  Fingerslam.com.  Okay.  Well, never mind, then.  Oh, okay, I thought you had more to it.  Hold on a minute, now.  I don't know if that's real or fake.  Go back to that.  What, fingerslam?  Let me tell you what makes it...  Oh, oh.  The fact is, she's holding his cock, but...  It's probably real, but you can't see where his cock connects with his body. 
[03:39:00]  That's true, I was thinking that, but...  The hand is blocking where the cock is.  I'm gonna think anything to say that's fake.  Maybe that is real.  Oh, you know what makes it real?  The vein in the bottom of his dick.  That looks like a hard dick.  Ow.  Oh, God, that looks so fucking painful.  That looks...  Funny if he's dead.  Yeah.  It could be.  Well, it wouldn't be the first time we saw one of those, right?  Seen movies like that.  You know, I used to have a fantasy when I was a little kid about girls.  You know, I was always into girls my own age.  You know, so when I was seven, I was into girls that were like seven years old. 
[03:39:30]  And when I was like...  I was never watching TV and like one of those kids that were into I Dream of Jeannie.  To me, she was like an old lady.  I wasn't into that.  So when I was like 10, I was into 10-year-old.  That's how it worked.  So I think when I was about 10 years old, I had this fantasy of a girl that was about  about four inches tall, totally naked.  And I wanted to put her in my mouth and then just pull her out of my mouth and kind of suck  on her like a lollipop. 
[03:40:00]  You wanted to be Danny from The Shining.  I said, Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.  She's the little whore that lives in my throat.  But I wanted to do that with her completely naked, but really little.  What's wrong with you?  I don't know.  That was just a fantasy that popped up when I mentioned like a little woman.  I love the new Anthony that just decided out of nowhere to start sharing some weird  shit with us.  It's a little weird, but it's like a tiny little, you know.  This has been happening for the last couple of months.  You're just sharing these weird things.  She'd be tiny, but completely naked and alive and completely like, you know, soft and 
[03:40:30]  everything.  And I would put her in my mouth and just go like, and then pop around my mouth gently,  you know, and she'd like it.  And I, you know, thought it was cool.  What's that about?  I don't know.  What's the story about that?  Wait a minute.  I think that is.  Okay, I'm sorry.  Oh, no.  Bukowski had a short story called Six Inches, I believe, where it was about how his girlfriend  told him he was fat and told him how to punch himself in the sides to lose his love handles. 
[03:41:00]  And he gradually got smaller and smaller until he was only six inches.  And then she used to fuck herself with him.  But, uh, my story.  I think that Anthony's, I want to know, that's what I want to know of Anthony's dream.  And the little girl you were putting in your mouth, was she standing like in a thatch of  grass with two beanbag chairs in front of her?  No. 
[03:41:30]  It was a girl, not a weenie.  And it was just the thought that, like, I would feel all of a naked girl's body all on  my tongue at the same time, like her ass, her stomach, legs, everything, all at the  same time.  And that was like, like a kid fantasy I had.  Okay, terrific.  It went away after a while.  I thought it was pretty cool for a kid. 
[03:42:00]  Yeah.  I thought it was pretty cool for a kid, little fantasy.  It's wrong.  It doesn't matter.  It's just weird.  It is weird.  I'm not saying it's not weird.  All right, you guys.  Blow kids under the porch.  All right, listen.  That's what I'm saying.  Now you get to the hot stuff.  Listen, there's a challenge going on here.  At least I just took their little dicks in my mouth and called it a day.  I didn't want to devour their souls.  The listeners are challenging us because they saw a finger slam. 
[03:42:30]  They're like, fuck that.  Go to SwollenTip.com.  No.  No, not SwollenTip.com.  Doug, are you playing along at home?  Yeah, yeah.  That's got to be really bad.  Let's go to SwollenTip.com.  Tip.  Get the fuck out of here.  Come on.  Stop it.  Stop it.  That's like a fucking big white dildo or something.  And it is being crammed in the guy's dick hole.  Is that real?  This is the first one I saw, yeah.  This was on my memory board, yeah. 
[03:43:00]  Let me tell you what.  It's obviously the same guy.  Because you can tell it's the same people that run the website because the same ads are on it.  Yeah, yeah.  Holy shit.  This guy, yeah.  She's gleaming it.  Oh, yeah.  And she's got the ring on the same finger.  You're right.  Those are the two fingers she was using to put into her.  It's like she's searching for something.  She probably is a guy who's not an asshole.  She's trying to fission her engagement ring out of the drain.  She's got gum on the end of it.  I like that ring on her face. 
[03:43:30]  She's not giggling or anything.  No.  Yeah, there's no irony there.  Oh, too.  All right, here's that.  Wow, that's nasty.  How about discharge.org?  Go.  Discharge.org.  Come on, E-Rock.  Stop running around fucking looking for gay porn for your own self.  That isn't a military site?  We'll soon find out.  Discharge.org is on the way here.  E-Rock is so slow.  He's so slow with these.  And all our listeners get to it first. 
[03:44:00]  I thought he was there when I said that.  E-Rock?  Come on, E.  Where were you, E-Rock?  I brought my algae yeast infection.  What are you getting?  He was getting water.  Oh, you got it?  He was getting water because he gets all nervous.  You got it?  Because E-Rock had to get water even though he knew we were kind of surfing here.  This is like a medical site.  All right.  I had to get water.  I'm glad I don't have one of those chicks that checks the history and then starts blaming 
[03:44:30]  you on all the shit you licked at.  On all the shit you licked at?  Yeah.  Clear history.  I was going to put out a red alert to my girlfriend.  Don't pop these sites on.  Our computer needs updating.  Yeah.  There's going to be like some viruses.  Hey, is there a way for you, Chick, to find your history if you delete it?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's still in the Windows temporary folder.  How about in your Mac?  In the Mac?  It's even worse.  I have no clue where the hell they reside over there. 
[03:45:00]  I don't do anything.  Jimmy, you should play it safe and just throw out computers every three months.  Three months?  Just like daily.  When you're getting your brand new sneakers, throw out your computer.  Just drop them in acid.  Right.  Just throw it out and start over.  All right.  Let's say hi to Michael.  Wow.  From Asheville again.  Michael, what's up?  Hey, Yone.  Love you guys.  I love the show.  What about Doug Stanhope?  I was going to tell Ant.  I had kind of the same dream or imagination that he did. 
[03:45:30]  I used to do it in reverse.  I used to fantasize that I could be four or five inches tall.  And then I'd climb up inside the girl and just kind of wall around up in there.  Oh, really?  In her mouth?  No.  Oh, in her pussy.  You would go in her...  Like, you would...  Wow, that's odd.  I never, like, fantasized about that.  I'd be putting the whole girl in your mouth.  It's not.  Come on, man.  No, it isn't.  It isn't.  I love Michael.  He's sticking up on his fetters.  Yours is weirder. 
[03:46:00]  Because you'd be, like, in a vagina.  Hold on.  Let's ask Jimmy which one's weirder.  Jimmy?  Yeah, come on, Jimmy.  I don't know.  Miniature girl in your mouth, the whole girl in your mouth, or miniature dude walking  around inside of a girl's vagina.  I wanted to feel the wonderfulness of a girl, her complete wonderfulness in my mouth.  Every bit of it.  Yeah, but you wanted to be surrounded by a pussy and just sit in it like it's a big velvet  chair that happens to stink. 
[03:46:30]  Who wants to lounge in a pussy?  Oh!  Oh, God, look at this video.  Holy shit.  I'm punching out.  This guy is getting kicked in the balls.  So, get ready.  You ready?  Go to...  I'm ready.  ManGems.com.  M-A-N-G-E-M-S.com.  This fucking guy is getting kicked and elbowed over...  Not elbowed.  Need.  Need, sorry. 
[03:47:00]  Over and over again in the balls.  And these are not being pulled.  Well, you know, the kicks.  They're not being pulled.  Oh, we are fucking up the 92.3 K-Rock computers today.  Good luck.  Get all these viruses out.  There you go, man.  I love that all of these are on a loop, so it looks like there's no closure.  It never ends.  It's like hell.  That's what hell would be like.  Yeah, the guy only took probably like four shots, and they looped it to make a look.  Still.  Yeah, still. 
[03:47:30]  Look at what a pussy.  Doesn't even have a heart on.  Yeah, no.  What a dope.  I fucking...  I never lose my rod if a knee or a shoe goes into it.  My balls and dick laugh at that.  That's a good one.  I can take three fingers in my cock hole, by the way.  Can you?  Yes, I can.  And then you can even do like the little expansion and go...  Open up a little.  Get that webbing.  I kind of wish the dominatrixes would do stuff like prostate exams, all this shit I'm supposed  to do now that I'm 40.  Like, I'll never do. 
[03:48:00]  I'll die of those diseases, because it's way too gross.  But if a dominatrix did it, if she was going to give me like a flu shot or check my prostate  and make it dirty...  Or stick some up your ass.  Like if she would check it for real.  Like if she would check your prostate for real and then just shit in your mouth.  Oh, by the way, Squeaky Wheel...  I'm doing it in a really filthy way.  Squeaky Wheel from Columbus.  Please isolate and edit ants.  I wanted to feel the wonderfulness of it in my mouth.  Oh, well, I was talking about a young woman when I was a kid. 
[03:48:30]  That's all right, dude.  I just wanted to feel...  Everything.  Legs.  Ken from West...  Why wouldn't that be nice?  No.  Ken from Westchester.  Ken.  As a matter of fact.  At all.  Nice.  What's up, Ken?  Hey, what's up?  It's Ken from Westchester.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  I got this condition, right?  It's called a urethra dilation.  Once a month, I have to go to the doctor and they shove rods in me, starting from the  size of your pinky to the size of a little bit bigger than your thumb. 
[03:49:00]  They're about 12 inches long and the girth is just outrageous.  They have to shove it in and fucking spread the hole back open because the urethra closes  up on its own.  And this is some kind of disease you could have?  Yeah.  Oh, holy God.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Doug.  Doug.  Hold on there, Ken.  We'll get back to you.  Go to mudfall.com.  Go. 
[03:49:30]  What is it?  Mudfall.  Mudfall.com.  Go there.  Oh, my God.  It looks like he's trying to start his asshole as an engine and it's just sputtering out engine  oil.  All over the face of an agent.  It's like a fucking harrier hovering.  You there?  That is horrible.  Doug, you there?  Yeah, I get it.  There's an Asian girl on her back with her mouth open and there's an asshole right over 
[03:50:00]  her and it's firing out like a yellow greenish diarrhea shit onto her chin and face.  It's wonderful.  It's like pure wasabi coming out of his ass.  Oh, all right.  Are we going to move on to the next one?  Damn, man.  All right.  You ready, E-Rock?  You got to be quick on this one.  Yeah.  Be quick, E-Rock.  Ken, hold on.  We're going to get back to you because I've never heard of this condition before.  But hold on one sec.  All right.  Go to ready, E-Rock?  Let's see how fast you can type.  TheShithole.com.  Great.  Watch it go to just fucking boom and XM pops up. 
[03:50:30]  All right.  Then what's that?  And scroll down.  Once you recover.  Uh-oh.  Go to the mega shit bath extravaganza.  Wow.  That's a nice one.  Holy Jesus.  Oh, my God.  It's just people shitting on people and smearing it.  Keep going.  That doesn't have to look like shit.  This is what you hate is those Asian girls always smile when they do this. 
[03:51:00]  They smile.  They have this big, wide smile.  Keep going.  Keep going.  I mean, Amber.  If you don't get to a trailer, Eric, I'm going to cry.  Just keep going.  Keep going.  Yeah.  I want to see a movie.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Scat princess is holding a fucking mouthful of nudity.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Nude nudity.  Oh, my God.  Look at this.  Oh.  Keep going.  No.  He's opening a movie.  We got to see the movie.  Yeah.  But look at scat race queen part two. 
[03:51:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, get the fuck out of here.  It's being shit.  This green stuff like pea soup into a bowl.  Go all the way down.  I want to see all the pictures before we decide which one to pop on.  And then it goes into someone's face.  The ball.  Keep going.  Keep going.  That is disgusting.  Who is into this shit fucking?  Oh, my God.  She is covered in shit.  It's her own duty hat.  It's a duty hat video.  It's for real.  Who the hell is into this? 
[03:52:00]  Keep going.  Holy shit.  Is this funny?  Like, is anyone into this sexually?  Or do they just watch it to laugh?  Because it is funny.  Milky wet scat dreams.  There's someone laying there getting some milky wet scat shot on them.  Wow.  As per the title.  Keep going.  Keep going.  This is the comic relief porn that I jerk off to, that I look at after I jerked off to  something that's really sick that I'm into.  Yeah, this has nothing to do with sexy. 
[03:52:30]  All right.  That is.  No.  You don't like the shit head?  I want to see her tip that to be polite.  Good day to you, too.  No one makes the shit head so fucking funny is the height of the shit head.  Oh, it's just massive.  Her head is way down.  Her head is way down.  Her head is way down.  Her head is way down.  Yeah.  But the biggest logs ever, by the way.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Yes.  I've just heard about this site.  Oh, okay. 
[03:53:00]  Oh, boy.  You need a pen, Jimmy?  Yeah.  There you go.  Jimmy's going to jot it down.  Write it down.  Jot it down.  Jot it down.  I think we're going to get a little video action here any second now.  I see it downloading.  K-Rock's going to kick us out of the studio soon.  Oh, they are?  Oh, you got to think.  This can't be good for the computers.  It's funny.  This can't be good for the computers.  These are all in Tom's favorites.  Tom's a scat fiend.  Scat.  He likes this.  Tie shitting. 
[03:53:30]  That fucking shit hat will make me laugh all day.  All fucking day.  A big, heavy shit hat that's leaking down the side of her head.  Like she went to lean in to go, how do you do?  And it started to leak.  Like this, your hat is morphing.  It's like a big top hat.  Isn't that horrible?  She's kind of putting on the Ritz.  Instead of wearing a tux, someone has shit on her head.  She's putting on the shits.  Here we go.  When you've been beaten and molested your whole life, putting on the shits. 
[03:54:00]  Oh, here she goes.  Oh, my God.  She's got a bowl full of shit, and she is rubbing it all over her body.  I love when in some of these porn movies they're doing something so horrific,  and the porn star will attempt to make it look like she's really into it,  but you can see right through it that she is beyond disgusting, too.  Well, obviously, they're good actresses.  They wouldn't be doing this type of film.  And she said, you know what it is?  The bowl she was dumping on herself.  She misunderstood the quote.  It said, life's a bowl of cherries. 
[03:54:30]  She just misunderstood the rest of it because she's Asian.  And it's good that they beep out the pubic hair.  They're pixelating the pubic hair.  That's the problem with this video.  Pubes are dirty.  Lovely culture.  Just amazing.  Oh.  All right.  Hey, let's go back to Ken Westchester.  So Ken has this condition where they have to stick crap in his urethra because it closes up.  And some of the instruments are as thick as a thumb. 
[03:55:00]  Yeah, no kidding.  And how often do you have to have it re-reamed?  Well, let's put it this way.  When it first happened to me, I had to go every week for six months to have this done.  It's nine rods.  One that starts as the size of your pinky, the width I'm talking.  Right, right.  And they work their way up to stretch it.  Yeah.  They stick it in, and they, like, fucking twist it to stretch it back open because the tissue on the head scars back down.  So now they got me to one month. 
[03:55:30]  What was the name of the condition?  It's called urethra dilation.  Now, I was doing research on it on the internet to, like, so I can show people what the fuck I go through because everybody says to me,  Oh, it can't be that bad.  And, you know, the only documentation on the internet is, like, doctors' pictures and books, rather, of drawings.  And they just show, like, a little stick inside the dick hole, which is fucking, you know, ponderous compared to what they do to me.  It's crazy, guys.  Dude, how'd you know there was a problem? 
[03:56:00]  Like, you would try to piss and, what, your dick would blow up like a balloon?  You want to get into it, I'll get into it.  I'll try to be as quick as possible.  One morning after a long night of drinking, I woke up.  Dude, could not fucking piss.  I fucking looked down.  I'm weary-headed.  I got a hangover.  My hole was gone.  Just gone.  Not there no more.  Just gone.  Wow.  Your piss hole was gone.  Is it over?  Yeah, it was actually fucking, it was gone.  I guess, you know, it's kind of like when you had an earring and you decide the earring wasn't cool anymore, so you took it out. 
[03:56:30]  And then, like, the earring comes back, it's cool again, so you're like, you know what, I have an earring hole.  I'm going to fucking put my earring back in.  And then you realize that earring hole's gone.  And you've got to poke it through.  Your piss hole disappeared.  I swear to God, this is no shit.  I mean, I went to the emergency room.  Mind you, I was drinking all night, so my bladder feels like it's going to explode.  So they take me in right away to the emergency room.  And it was the most embarrassing thing of my life.  I got two nurses and a fucking doctor who looked like an intern trying to fucking use a scalpel to reopen the hole. 
[03:57:00]  I'm sitting there with me.  They're like, here, control your morphine drip.  I'm like, okay, but turn that fucker up as much as I can, and I'm fucking high as hell.  And I got my poor pregnant wife sitting next to me, dropped this whole thing.  And they finally were about to wheel me into the OR to cut my belly open, I guess, to put a catheter in that way.  And then, thank God, luck, fucking the urologist on call walked in there, threw everybody out of the room. 
[03:57:30]  And he was able to get a catheter in me, drained like fucking two bags of fucking piss out of me.  And then put a catheter in me for three days.  I went to his office.  He did the procedure for the first time.  And let me tell you, I cleared out his waiting room because I was fucking screaming so loud.  Oh, wow.  It's just tremendous, man.  I mean, if they don't know what causes it, it just happens.  It happens mostly in older gentlemen, let's say, that maybe go through it once a year just to make sure everything is okay. 
[03:58:00]  I'm 33 years old.  No, I'm 32 years old.  This happened to me when I was 28, 29.  There's no drug in the world that could prevent you from screaming on that thing.  Well, I mean, they know, oh, here, take a couple of Vicodin before you come in.  You know, that'll help.  And they inject Laticane in to numb it up, which it works for the first two rods, and then that's it.  Forget it.  As long as I've been doing it, you know, it's over two years now.  You think I'd be used to it.  You ain't getting used to it, no matter fucking what.  Will it heal eventually? 
[03:58:30]  They say that it can be cured with surgery.  I guess they stitch it open somehow, but there's doctors saying to me that, well, you're a young guy.  If we fucked it up and it don't work, then you're going to have to come here every fucking week for the rest of your life.  I'd rather wait.  And I'm thinking, how much longer do you want to wait, dude?  It's been like two years.  It was two years in May.  How much fucking longer do you want to wait?  Because this is starting to get, you know, out of hand.  Just have them implant a straw or something in there.  Like one of the ones where you can bend the neck. 
[03:59:00]  Yeah, bendable straws.  Bendable straws.  I don't know how comfortable you think that would feel, guys.  I mean, really.  Better than what you're going through.  I don't know if it's ever gone for at this point, but I mean, that can't be comfortable, I don't think.  Too bad that's like, you would have won the what the hell is that competition.  Oh, hell yeah.  That's a biggie right there.  Disappearing pisshole.  Disappearing pisshole beats everything.  Magic.  Tell me that.  I'll come in there with a fucking rod tomorrow and shove it in.  Okay.  Give me a buck.  How much rod can you take at this point? 
[03:59:30]  These things, I'm telling you.  I have pictures of my fucking email, my Travis, whoever.  I have pictures of rods.  I'm telling you, they're 12 inches long.  And the longest one, the girth, I'm telling you, it's wider than your thumb.  Look at your thumb and just think of it round.  Totally round.  And he jams them in all the fucking way.  I mean, it's got to be touching my bladder at this point.  That's not real.  It's not comfortable.  I was going to come in for a while because they had me doing it every week. 
[04:00:00]  And then they were like, well, come back every two weeks.  But here's an at-home kit you can use.  And I'm like, what?  They're like, oh, do it every two days.  I'm like, okay.  So they give me this little plastic one.  And it's probably about, you know, four or five inches long.  And it starts off with skinny.  And it gets to be probably about the width of your index finger, maybe.  And my wife was doing it to me because I can't fucking do it myself.  See, again, this is a perfect place for dominatrix health care.  Good luck to you.  It would be way better if some chick in a latex skirt was making you eat her ass 
[04:00:30]  while she, I'm going to jam this down your cockle if you don't eat my ass good.  It would be better.  I don't think it was going to be good enough for the what the hell is that contest.  Doug, he's on to something here.  Dominatrix health care.  I like it.  Make those freaky things a little easier.  At the very least, it should be the name of a punk band or something.  Just write a fucking book.  All right, Ken, thank you.  We're looking at the video right now of the bald guy ramming his head into the vagina.  It looks like Bob Kelly attacking an ice cream cake. 
[04:01:00]  That is so fake, though.  Yeah, that's fake.  No, it's real, I swear.  All right, Doug, we're going to go.  Hey, thanks for having me.  Hi, this is Doug Stanhope.  You can find my shit at DougStanhope.com or MySpace slash DougStanhope or YouTube or all the other places.  Please pirate my stuff and pass it around to your friends.  It's the only way that I'll ever be heard of.  It's the best of the worst of the comics on the O.B. and Anthony show. 
[04:01:30]  O.B. and Anthony.  Welcome back to the O.B. and Anthony radio program.  It's the best, the best of the worst of the comics on the O.B. and Anthony show.  Hey, this is Patrice O'Neal, and this is the worst of Colin Quinn on the O.B. and Anthony show.  You remember Colin?  He had a TV show in the early 90s.  The early.  Colin's always on TV the early decade.  He was on the early 80s on MTV, the early 90s on SNL, and the early 2000s. 
[04:02:00]  Watch out, 3001.  Fucking.  Watch out.  Watch out, 2022.  Colin will be back, you motherfucker.  We're back with the O.B. and Anthony show.  Disturb the game.  There's all that.  We checked out the new song from Disturb yesterday.  They didn't have any of the yelling and screaming.  No.  And the. 
[04:02:30]  By the way, another reason why MTV sucks.  They won't play the new Disturb video.  It's too controversial.  Controversial?  It's too controversial.  What is in it that is too controversial?  Too many white people?  What's in it?  Too many white people. 
[04:03:00]  What's too controversial?  I would love to know.  Ben, do you know?  Oh, I think I know, Holna.  What?  I think I know who knows this.  Could it be?  He knows better than I do.  He knows everything.  Oh, here it comes.  Yeah, look at him.  He's got a smoking jacket on now.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  It was sitting in my studio.  I guess somebody had it in there previously.  You know what the best thing is? 
[04:03:30]  Right before he walks in, I see him turn backwards and open the door with his back so he doesn't  spill his martini.  Like it jiggles a little and just about bumps the rim of the glass, the martini.  Then he just spins right around the olive, kind of swirls slowly in the glass as he stops.  Usually when we give someone a nickname around here, they hate it, but you're going with it.  You're kind of working with it.  That's good.  Oh, yeah.  Look at me smile every time that music comes on.  He's got a winger smoking jacket on.  That's nice.  Nice logo in the back there, Steve.  Here's a guy that likes his nickname.  So you know something about why they're banning? 
[04:04:00]  Yeah, it's very Holocaust-ish, very September 11th-ish, buildings blowing up like it's the  singer from Disturbed walking down a crowded city street and there's a huge explosion off  in the distance and there's people burning to a crisp and buildings falling down.  What's bad about that?  I don't personally find anything wrong with it, but apparently MTV had an issue with it.  Steve, not asking you.  Take another sip.  Everything's fine.  It's the reality of our world these days.  Yeah.  And if he wants to turn it into, you know, video art, whatever, if it has something to 
[04:04:30]  do with one of his songs and he wants to put it on there, what was MTV's problem?  They're all scared.  A bunch of chicks running the networks.  What do you expect?  They're all scared.  No one knows how to be edgy anymore in entertainment.  They're just the worst.  There goes Martini Steve, and now with his winger smoking jacket.  There he goes.  Wow.  Yeah.  Martini Steve.  Trust me, we know it's annoying as hell, but what else are we going to do? 
[04:05:00]  Isn't it weird?  That time, one of the interns actually had to hold the door open because he had just  lit one of those cigarettes in the long cigarette holder, and he had the martini in the other  hand, and he's looking around like, hey, open the door.  He's looking around like, whoa, hey.  I can't open the door like this.  I don't have a third hand.  Clay Bertrand.  Yeah, please.  All right.  We got to get the trainee story out before we move on here.  Well, I just want to know, you and Colin Quinn.  At his suggestion.  At his suggestion, went to see trannies. 
[04:05:30]  Sing.  Guys dressed like women.  Yes.  Sing.  Yes.  Now, this sounds like the gayest night out.  I know it does.  That you could have with another man.  No, I've had gayer experience with a tranny.  Believe me.  Why?  I've seen one hum.  What?  Like, first of all, how did Colin approach you with this?  Hey, you want to go see some trannies sing?  Yeah.  You want to go? 
[04:06:00]  No.  I don't know.  I figured it'd be fun.  We'll go trannies.  They sing.  I don't know.  You want to go?  You do, you don't.  He had gone the week earlier.  Yeah.  And came to report that there was a fine show.  He went the week earlier, so he's going back.  Yes.  What's up with Colin Quinn?  What's up with Colin?  I don't know.  Occasionally, I like a man. 
[04:06:30]  So, what did you guys see?  It was two trannies.  And I have to tell you, I went.  I figured it'd be a goof.  Of course.  They were really good.  Good what?  Singers.  Singing good?  They weren't hot, so I didn't have the whole, like, well, maybe if no one I knew was here.  They weren't like those trannies that...  What were they singing that they were considered good?  We sat through, like, one and a half shows.  They sing like...  Don't they sing like...  Is it show tunes?  No.  Liza Minnelli and all that crap. 
[04:07:00]  No, they were really good.  They're two of the best voices I've ever heard.  What do they sing?  The only one...  This is where you bury yourself.  Go ahead.  What do they sing, Jim?  I don't know most of the songs.  I know one...  I'll tell you, I don't know those names.  They did a couple Aussie songs.  They didn't do any Aussie.  No?  The one did a version of, uh, uh, Nights in White Satin, which was good.  All right.  And the other one, which I really loved the version, uh, he did of, uh, it's so hard to  say he is, did of, uh, uh, Burning Ring of Fire by Johnny Cash. 
[04:07:30]  I really enjoyed it.  Burning Ring of Fire.  I enjoyed...  Yeah, I'm sure there's another Burning Ring of Fire in his pants.  They got the Burning Ring.  The Burning Ring.  I enjoyed watching...  Nights in White Satin, howl, never reaching my end, howl, letters are howl, never meaning  to sound...  They were delightful.  Delightful trannies singing popular songs of the days of yore. 
[04:08:00]  Great, great voice.  I really...  It was a place called Bardot, and I don't know them.  I'm not...  Bardot?  Bardot.  As in Bridget Bardot, one of the favorite actresses of the fags a whole...  Is she?  Of course.  I don't know.  It's Barry.  All those old, uh, blondes.  It's Barry Bardot.  So you, you saw, uh, a show and a half, or...  We stayed for...  Because Kyle had a friend.  Why, why would you...  Because he was an old friend.  Oh, a friend.  No, it was a female friend.  Someone I knew.  Oh, you sure?  A time ago, he talked to her, and they were just sitting there. 
[04:08:30]  Hang.  Yes, I'm positive.  Okay, I thought maybe, you know, Tranny Blaisle.  Yeah, but they had wanted to see it, so we got to meet there.  And, you know, whatever.  It was uneventful.  A lot of, uh, what was the audience like?  Um, uh, all gay men.  Right.  And me and Kyle.  A couple of, uh...  Did they do this one?  Little Abba dancing queen?  No.  Very popular song now, with Mamma Mia, such a big hit on Broadway.  I did not do this song.  Did you go see Mamma Mia on Broadway with Colin? 
[04:09:00]  I certainly didn't.  That's a great show.  They do, uh, Abba.  You can dance, ha-oh.  You can die.  Having the time of your life.  Sit on my lap, Jimmy.  Ha-oh.  See that girl.  I think it's a girl.  Watch that scene.  Look at the closet clean.  Ha-oh.  No?  I try to show my diverse entertainment interests.  I get accused of just being an Aussie fanatic, which I am. 
[04:09:30]  You being with trannies isn't that odd.  You know what?  You just out-gayed, ain't I?  Yeah.  What?  Well, there's things we admit to on this show that puts us in the gay zone, but you just,  you out-gayed us with this one.  That's not gay.  I didn't, you're not gay.  I never knew Colin Quinn was gay.  He's not gay.  What?  He's not gay.  Two men go to the tranny club?  I know it doesn't look good on the service.  It really doesn't.  But it was to enjoy.  There was actually a couple of straight couples there. 
[04:10:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  We know you pretty well.  What did he say to get you to go there?  Yeah.  You don't do anything.  It was more like he said, I saw this tranny singer who was great, and I'm like, oh,  this is going to be hilarious.  Really, that's all he had to say to me.  I saw this tranny singer.  She's great.  You want to go?  Yeah, man, sure.  I'm easy.  You're a fag, too.  No.  Yeah, fag, man.  I got to tell you, it was really good.  I don't know.  Fag.  It's probably a setup by all your friends.  They got together and go, you know what?  We need to know.  Colin, make believe you really care about this tranny place, and invite Jim and see if 
[04:10:30]  he goes for it.  There were two singers.  Yeah.  Joey Arias was one.  I think that's the name.  Joey Arias?  And my particular favorite was Raven O.  You remember the names?  I certainly do.  Raven O?  Raven is such a tranny name.  Yeah, I don't care.  Yeah.  But.  Raven O.  They were really great singers.  I got to get out.  Yeah.  Let's go to Trippie.  Trippie, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[04:11:00]  Hey.  I've been to that place.  I was there about five years ago.  And?  And I had a great time.  Oh, cool.  It's no more gay than staring at mannequin man junk in Miami.  You know what?  That's an excellent point, sir.  Thank you very much.  A little gayer.  Yeah, but I mean, when I went there, it wasn't just all gay guys.  They had lesbians there, and they were straight people.  I mean, it was all mixed.  A couple of, it was predominantly gay men, but there was a couple of straight couples, because  they asked, are there any gay guys here?  And they all went, ooh.  Yeah.  Oh, there was a good amount.  There was a good amount.  Did they say, are there any gay guys here? 
[04:11:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They asked, what's the audience?  I thought maybe there was a catchphrase.  How many of the, you know...  Did you raise your hand going out?  I certainly didn't.  Let's just be goofy.  Dude, and I felt like a...  Let's be silly.  You know how an ugly...  I'm going to raise two hands.  Why am I sticking to the seat?  They're all good-looking people, and I'm standing there in my Black Sabbath t-shirt, just standing  out like a little straight, white-stress, jersey, gay-tart.  So you were upset that the men dressed like women weren't finding you attractive?  No, no, no, no.  I just meant...  What?  No?  No, it's not what I'm saying.  It's not what I'm saying at all. 
[04:12:00]  You really are a creep.  It's not what I'm saying.  Okay.  All right.  It's just a couple of guys.  Did you get any movement?  In the front of my trousers?  Just...  Did you get any movement?  No, I didn't.  No?  No, I wasn't turned on.  Not attractive in the least.  Hayden, what's up?  Yo, what's up, man?  I've been to the show down at Bardo, and there's this one dude who...  Joey Arias, I think his name is.  Yes!  He looks like Fred Flintstone, but he does Billie Holiday.  Amazing. 
[04:12:30]  Billie Holiday.  Every gay guy loves Billie Holiday.  I don't like Billie Holiday, but...  No, I don't like Billie Holiday, but it's amazing if you have a dude that looks like Fred Flintstone.  An exception to the rule, then.  The stuff was great.  Yeah, it was incredible.  But the guy looks like Fred Flintstone.  Pretty much in drag.  Fred Flintstone in drag.  Hey there, buddy.  Hey there, buddy.  Hey there, buddy.  Fuck, guy, bro.  Bad Fred.  Hey, Fred.  What did you do me?  And they had a little band with them.  Great little band, too.  A little stand-up bass player and a little drummer and a, I guess, guitar player in a little area. 
[04:13:00]  Yeah?  Yeah, it's good.  Did you put your head on Colin's shoulder?  No, I didn't put my head on Colin's shoulder.  Oh, when I started singing love songs.  No, I didn't.  It wasn't a close moment.  We each had a seltzer.  We chatted, and I'm like, wow, they were really good.  I'm a meaty-breasted little nothing, Fred.  And I'm going to go back again.  You will not discourage me.  You will go back again.  I said they were really good, man.  With your partner, Colin?  No, not with my partner, Colin.  You guys going to be adopting soon?  No, we're not adopting.  I really don't like either of you. 
[04:13:30]  He happens to be a very good, straight friend of mine that we just went to do something.  Fast forward 10 years.  Is this crying Jimmy Norton by the bedside of an emaciated Colin Quinn?  Applying makeup to all of his bruises on his face and arms.  With their little adopted lad by Jim's side.  Little Vietnamese boy bouncing.  And I'm like, don't do that.  Daddy's sick.  Thank you, Jimmy.  You know I love you.  Jimmy, who's going to be daddy now? 
[04:14:00]  Did Colin get any?  Mommy and the relationship.  I got it.  I got it.  I realized that.  Colin get any at the end of the night?  No.  We all went out to eat afterwards.  And then I dropped Colin off at the end.  There was nothing.  There was no sex.  You dropped some off at Colin's end?  No, I didn't drop it off at Colin's end.  Oh, oh, oh.  Did you drop it in the end?  My ears.  No, I didn't drop one off on Colin.  You're barely here.  I really wish he was here because I could use the help.  It bugs me.  It was not a gay thing at all.  No, it sounds like a fun night out.  Yeah, it doesn't sound gay at all. 
[04:14:30]  No.  No, I think that I would recommend you both go.  Oh, together?  No, you have girlfriends here.  Just Ming and Opie?  You're both straight men.  You can enjoy it.  I think we'd go to a football game.  I would, too.  I didn't give up the Yankees in football.  Like, no more for me, guys.  Right.  But I just happened to enjoy that.  You want to see Jeter.  You sure did not.  You sure didn't give up on the Yankees.  It was a good show.  That was like fun.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Did they do this one for you? 
[04:15:00]  They certainly did not do this one.  No?  No.  This is a big hit.  And I'm going to request Burning a Fire when I go back.  That was my favorite moment.  The crying.  The crying game.  I thought it was a girl.  I had a feeling it was a judgment error to bring this up.  Something told me this is the one you keep running your hat.  Yeah, probably you don't want to bring this one up.  Yeah, right.  I enjoyed it.  Hey, what's the harm?  Two guys.  Two guys.  Two guys.  Men. 
[04:15:30]  Till what I felt was.  Then Jim and Colin went to the Tranny Bar.  And they saw guys dressed like girls singing great songs.  The only reason they were there was because of the music.  And not the fact that they were guys dressed like girls.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Guys dressed like girls.  His name was Bob.  But he called himself Wendy.  Oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[04:16:00]  He used to do the news on SNL.  But now he's doing Jim Norton's A.  That's really hurtful.  Jim is not gay.  That's very mean-spirited.  It really is.  I'm sorry.  I apologize to Jimmy.  It was fun.  You finally decided to socialize, and this is what you do. 
[04:16:30]  This is what you do.  It was something different.  I'm like, you know what?  I'm too close-minded, and I went, and I just tell you, it would be more funny if I wanted  to trash it, and it stunk, but I enjoyed it.  I can't even trash it.  It took one night to do something other than go around Manhattan and perform 24 hours a  day.  Oh, no, that was after my second show.  It was.  Yes.  Anyone hit on you there?  No one hit on me, dude.  Women don't hit on me.  Gay guys have a higher standard than they do. 
[04:17:00]  They're not hitting on me.  I'm awful.  I don't get hit on by any of the gay guys.  That's why I have no homophobia or paranoia.  Like, hey, just don't touch me.  You ever see gay guys?  They're all models.  I'm awful.  There was one Tree Fort episode, but since then, not one gay guy's come on to me.  You didn't have to start snoring during the performance, did you?  Hey, uh, what do you say?  Jim. 
[04:17:30]  Jim.  Jim, you want a f***ing job?  Jim.  You fall asleep during the show?  You want me to suck your f***?  Come on.  Boop, boop, boop, boop.  Geep, geep, geep, geep, geep.  One day soon I'm gonna tell them you're about to call you.  I'm gonna slip my hands down his pants so you can make something. 
[04:18:00]  God, that's a nice fat f***.  No, I was watching the show.  I'm just watching the show.  I'm not doing it.  Someone wants to know if the stools were upside down?  No, they weren't.  So we could fit more people in the club?  Well, it's a popular show.  You know how they like to squeeze more people in these places?  Did Colin push your stool in when you sat?  No?  Someone wants to know if you went to the after party at the Ramrod? 
[04:18:30]  No, and no, I did not.  We sat there, and I stood, actually.  All right.  And the couple in front of us, there was a...  What?  Yeah.  There was a couple, a guy-girl couple in front of us, talking very loudly and being very rude.  Oh.  You were bothered because you wanted to focus on the show?  I wanted...  It was a very...  It's a very, very small place.  Probably just a little bit bigger than the studio in the green room.  So you say with everything going on, the girl is the thing that annoyed you the most?  No?  That's what I heard, Ed.  That's what I heard, yes.  Now that I think about it.  Would it have been better if there were just no girls there? 
[04:19:00]  No, it wouldn't have been better.  Okay.  I'm just asking.  You know what?  It would have been better.  Just a bunch of men enjoying some music.  Were they cramping your style, these women?  No, they weren't.  Just a bunch of men.  Well, they're referred to as little bitches by anybody, no?  Ew, they have boobies.  Eh.  Seltzer and enjoyed the show.  I'm going back.  Everything.  I'm proud to say that.  Right?  All right.  Enjoy any form of entertainment. 
[04:19:30]  Back when men were transvestites, having other men do things to these men.  Yeah.  I have me.  Wow.  This gets...  Oh, jeez.  I don't want to get the AIDS, fellas.  Anthony, this gets even better.  Yes, Brett.  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  Hey, Jim Norton's coming to Lakewood, Ohio.  Well, I just wanted to let Jim and everybody else know that Lakewood is the second gayest  population, second only to San Francisco.  Oh. 
[04:20:00]  Is it really?  Is it a little gay area?  Oh, I'm sure that's just another coincidence, huh?  It is a coincidence.  I did not know that.  Yes, it is.  So you should be sitting right in there looking like a lesbian and everything.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  Ooh, ooh.  Ooh, ooh.  Ladies and gentlemen, coming to your stage, Jim Norton.  Jim Norton.  Yeah.  Dressed up like Dolly Parton.  You thought you were seeing a comedy show.  Yeah.  Well, that's right, ladies and gentlemen, making his way to the stage right now. 
[04:20:30]  You might recognize him from the Opie and Anthony show out of New York.  It's Jimmy Norton.  Let's give a big hand for Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy Norton, former Tampa Bay cheerleader.  She's got all the moves.  Let her hear it.  Let her hear it, people.  Make sure to tip the dancers.  They're doing this for you guys.  Look at Jimmy go.  Come on.  Second dance, Jimmy takes his shorts off, and he really lets it all hang out.  Look, there's Colin Quinn joining him on stage. 
[04:21:00]  Colin Quinn, you might remember him from SNL.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm using Jim Norton's real name.  Let's use his stage name.  Make way for Soupy Drek.  Soupy Drek taking the stage.  What a beautiful set of cans on Soupy Drek.  Yeah, dance it out, guys.  There they go.  Look at all these men coming over and handing them money.  Isn't this great? 
[04:21:30]  Here in the gayest area of Cleveland.  You know I love you, Jimmy.  Yeah, I really asked for it this time.  I deserve this.  Dummy I am.  I never should have agreed to go to that.  And you said there was not much to this story.  I didn't think there was.  I figured you guys would go, ah, trannies, huh?  And then move right on.  Only 40 minutes of good radio.  I forgot the improv skills.  Did Colin at some point go, I miss Ken Oba? 
[04:22:00]  There was no crying about other men?  There was no crying about other men.  It was just we stood there and we had our seltzers and laughed.  A little seltzer?  A little seltzer and had dinner out there in a French restaurant.  Oh, yeah.  That's a little French one on.  That'll help you get back to the man's zone.  It was very good food.  Suck it.  Right.  That's good.  All right.  Well, there it is.  Their little night.  It was a nice night.  It sounds like a lot of fun. 
[04:22:30]  What's the harm?  Tuesday.  I don't know if I'm going this Tuesday, but I will go again.  You'll go again?  I certainly will.  It's a short show.  It's less than an hour.  Oh.  Which I like.  That's quick?  Yeah, it's 45 minutes.  There's like four or five songs and that's the show.  You and Colin, in, out, done.  Right?  Yeah.  Fast.  That's good.  That's good.  Go out.  Did they hold hands during Knights in White Sets?  No, we didn't hold hands.  From Maryland.  Don't be silly. 
[04:23:00]  Of course they didn't hold hands.  They were too busy making out.  That would be gay.  Did you compliment the singers to each other?  Like, you lean over and go, Jeepers, Colin, thanks for taking me.  Boy, he really can belt it out.  Hey, Joe from Philly wants to know if Jim is changing the website from eatabullet.com to eataseed.com.  No, I'm not changing the website at all.  Well, Hung wants to know how many Shirley Temples did Jim pound back to loosen up?  Oh, you dicks. 
[04:23:30]  Tyro from Toronto.  Lay off, Jimmy.  He's not gay.  He's just desperate.  I shook the hand of one of the singers, Joey Arias, and I said it was a great show.  And he said, thank you very much.  You got to meet.  Were you and Colin by the backstage door?  No, there's no backstage.  Oh, no.  It's a small little bar area.  And the other, Raven Dash O, I actually wanted to meet and say great show, but I did not.  Oh, did you get a picture with either of them?  They're not famous.  No, I did not get a picture.  I thought maybe you'd put that up on your website. 
[04:24:00]  I certainly wouldn't.  That would be kind of cool.  Now, it would be kind of cool to see.  In hindsight.  Yeah, that's the funny little things you think of later.  These little things.  Frenchie.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  How was vacation, huh?  It was all right, Frenchie.  Jim Norton, you're a faggot, man.  I'm not a faggot.  Were you wearing a skirt that night, too?  No, I wasn't wearing a skirt.  Transvestite, whore. 
[04:24:30]  What?  Transvestite.  No, we enjoyed our vacation, and I wasn't wearing a skirt, you stroke victim.  I enjoyed the show with my friend Colin.  Go down your leg all the way down to your feet, you whore.  Huh?  You faggot.  Suck it, you faggot.  That's what we probably said to the waiters over there.  How about you suck my feet, you faggot?  Sousse-moi.  Yeah, exactly.  Sousse-moi, poufias. 
[04:25:00]  Listen, I am not gay.  I just enjoy the show.  You just enjoy the guys.  That's it, right?  Why do you feel like you have to defend yourself?  We were just asking questions.  I'm only saying, I just enjoy the show, and now Frenchie is calling, and maybe I'll give  his restaurant a plug and give out the location.  No, no, no, no, you're not, you faggot.  You whore.  That's how about 10,000 people in the front of the window throwing rocks at it, you faggot.  Die. 
[04:25:30]  All right, I'll take it back, you faggot.  All right, guys, take it easy.  Frenchie, we don't want to burn you out.  No problem, bye.  That's the nude photo threat.  I'll put him on the internet.  That's it.  Put him right on the internet, you bastard.  Chris from Long Island says that he saw Colin cutting out the bottom of his popcorn container  and then putting it in his lap and having you eat popcorn out of it.  Was there popcorn available there?  There was no popcorn available.  All right, then he's obviously lying.  I apologize.  Well, I don't know about that, because we have audio of Colin Quinn when Jim Norton was 
[04:26:00]  reaching into the popcorn thing there.  Oh, you like that, don't you, faggot?  Did they have hot chowder down there?  No, they didn't.  It was a bar atmosphere.  There was no food available to anybody.  How many Cosmos were just flying off the bar?  I bet a lot.  Cosmo, Cosmo, Cosmo.  It sounds fun.  Sounds interesting, sure. 
[04:26:30]  Yes, it was a good time.  It's the best of the worst of the comics on the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Welcome back to the O.B. and Anthony radio program.  It's the best, the best of the worst of the comics on the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Hey, it's Louis C.K., and this is the worst of Colin Quinn on the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Colin, when is it going to be over for that fucking old, unfunny, Irish faggot? 
[04:27:00]  This is the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Colin Quinn is in the studio.  He ran down in the studio.  I guess if you're just tuning in, Norton was giving us a cute little story about seeing a tranny thing, right?  There were tranny singers, transvestite singers, and Colin had seen them before and thought it would be fun to take Jimmy.  Yeah.  And you enjoyed yourself there. 
[04:27:30]  Very, very much.  Sounded good.  And for some reason, I don't know why, you were taking a ribbing about this whole thing.  And then Colin decided to show up.  I guess he heard some of that in the cab.  I think what he heard was Anthony pretty much calling him gay.  I didn't say that.  Well, I do have a statement I'd like to read.  All right, Colin, your statement.  Over the course of his career and life, a man builds a reputation. 
[04:28:00]  If you will, a name.  All he really has, what does a man have except his good name?  That's what I've done in my years on MTV.  I've kept any covert activities covert.  Then to come in here today to hear my character besmirched as I sit next to a Pakistani driver who's giving me the fish eye,  because even he knew when I told him to put it on,  because of Jim Norton, the loose-lipped nincompoop. 
[04:28:30]  My whole career now reduced.  No one will ever think of the happy laughs they had on a remote controller.  So they'll just think of me as the sodomite, boy hunter, degenerate.  Thanks to the rumor and innuendo of this.  Wow.  I think you got a lawsuit.  That sounded like really authentic.  Well, I don't think I have a lawsuit, because if we just leave it at what we know, I'll be fine.  I don't want people to start uncovering old skeletons. 
[04:29:00]  Really digging up the dirt.  But he said you guys had fun, and it was entertaining.  Oh, it was great.  How'd you find the place?  How'd I find it?  Yeah, somebody turned you on to it.  I stumbled upon it accidentally one night.  The drugs must be really good at SML.  My girlfriend at the time, Fantasia.  Yeah.  Fantasia.  It was entertaining, but not as entertaining as the Rich Voss comedy tour.  Have you heard about that? 
[04:29:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, he is a wolf.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Well, Voss is trying to put together a comedy tour.  Yes.  Everyone now is involved with this.  Everyone I know is somehow involved with this.  And everyone is walking around very uncomfortably and embarrassed.  We try to avoid eye contact with Voss.  Like, yeah, no, I'm sure it'll be good.  It'll be good.  Because after last time we had that fun show with everybody making fun of Norton's dumb tape.  Yeah.  Then as we walk out, Voss gets chummy with me, even though we've been at odds for like 15 years in comedy. 
[04:30:00]  We only talk because we both have mutual friends in comedy.  That's the only reason we even socialize.  So you pretty much have hated him for 15 years.  But because there was a little repartee happening just before vacation a couple weeks ago, Voss now thinks you guys are chummy.  Exactly.  Well, it's all because he wants to exploit whatever little credibility I have for his stupid tour, as well as exploit you guys.  So he's come to everybody with this idea. 
[04:30:30]  Pop-eyed and salivating.  Although I guess he'd be salivating anyway.  So he comes with this idea for this comedy tour he wants to do.  That involves you.  Yes.  Involves Jimmy?  No.  No, no.  No?  Who else does this involve?  No, there's a whole thing with Jimmy, too.  He's explaining that his comedy tour won't interfere with Jim Norton's tour.  Oh, so now he's not stepping on anyone's toes.  I never thought it would. 
[04:31:00]  I don't think it.  I don't think it.  He's got it all figured out.  That's even worse.  He showed me a contract with all sorts of stipulations.  He's been showing you contracts?  What?  I don't know if it's a contract, but just some.  Have my secretary type this up.  Daddy wants you to type this.  And I guess the tour would be, the tour's name would be the Comedians of O&A. 
[04:31:30]  Something that actually Ann and I want to do eventually.  The Girls of Enron.  Yeah, exactly.  Something like that, yeah.  And it would be featuring Rich Voss and Colin Quinn and Patrice O'Neal for whatever  she was available for.  But if it was something you guys would want to do, wouldn't you be the ones to bring it  up and certainly not Voss?  Voss is broke and he's desperate.  That's really what it is.  I'm sure it's all an even split. 
[04:32:00]  No, even like begrudgingly goes, maybe you'll get a little extra.  You know what?  You guys are just plain creeps.  I always know you're plain like two-faced creeps.  Colin, we booked two dates today.  Are you still in?  I'm out.  You're lying.  I'm out.  Colin, you're in.  Shut up.  I could book to myself, stupid.  Let me tell you something.  You can't draw in your house by yourself, okay?  You're through.  You need us.  Now shut up, okay?  Look, it's really us.  Do you mean Opie, Anthony, and you? 
[04:32:30]  No, listen.  You booked two dates already?  You guys have booked a couple dates?  What do you book?  Like the Tampa Improv?  No.  And some of the market, the show's not on it.  Only the markets are in on it, dummy.  No, we're going to follow a couple transvestite singers, then we go on after it.  You probably know them, though.  Yeah, but we make sure we don't tell the transvestites what you're getting, you creep.  I'm going to mention this.  Hold on.  Awful Voss.  He's a rotten man. 
[04:33:00]  He's doing something in Philadelphia, which would probably be...  Oh, well, he's not responsible for the Philly thing, right?  No.  Oh, YSP.  YSP put another thing together featuring Voss that's beyond hilarious.  What is this one where you're doing with the band?  You're hosting a show with the band, right?  Yeah, I'm hosting some show.  I don't know.  They just hired me to host some show.  It's not a big deal.  And they're paying Voss, as they should, and they have...  He doesn't even know what it is, though.  To bring Voss on, they have Frenchie and the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Oh, no.  And this is what this coward says. 
[04:33:30]  Don't tell them what I'm getting.  Yeah.  You creep.  Don't tell them what I'm getting.  That's something that, like, you know, Colin may say to another comic, like, you know,  I don't want him to know what I'm getting, so he gets competitive.  Right.  You feel that way about Laverne and Shirley and Frenchie.  And Frenchie.  I would tell them what I'm getting and show them the check and say,  don't F up my intro, dummies.  Oh, you're awful. 
[04:34:00]  He's standing out there last night in front of the cellar, leaning on his broken Mercedes.  The window doesn't work.  Oh, yeah.  You washboard abs.  I heard you punched Ben because he tried to roll the window down.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  That doesn't work.  I got to take it to my mechanic.  Daddy wants you to fix the window.  Wait, what happened with the Mercedes that's busted?  The window doesn't work.  What's the big deal?  The Mercedes is old. 
[04:34:30]  That was the one Hitler took to the bunker.  It's ancient.  You know what?  You know what?  You guys are really crazy.  Let's find as much garbage as we can on Voss on Friday.  Garbage?  We sat in traffic for 40 minutes, you horrible Jew.  You wouldn't put in a lot.  You're like, hey, there's parking up here.  Oh, look at it, stupid.  You said put in a lot a block away.  Rich, there's no parking.  It's 9th Avenue and Lincoln Tunnel traffic.  Where are we going to stop?  At the tolls?  It was 8 o'clock.  Can I park here?  He's awful.  And then we're like, I mean, we're stuck in traffic. 
[04:35:00]  He makes a left to go towards Broadway.  We're going to 9th and 43rd.  He makes a left to go down 7th.  I'm like, what are you doing?  What are you talking about?  7th was clear.  You circumnavigated, went down Broadway, and then all the way back, and he wouldn't park the car.  I'm like, dude, go to a lot.  He's like, no, there's a spot up there.  I'm like, there's not a spot, you idiot.  I found a spot right away.  Hey, look, it's stupid.  Did I find a spot right around the corner from the restaurant?  Yes, you did.  Right around the corner.  Yes, you did.  All right.  30 minutes later, you did.  Now, it wasn't my fault.  You know, we could have sat there until 10.30 p.m. and gotten plenty of spots. 
[04:35:30]  It wasn't a matter of there will never be parking here again.  Blame the traffic on me, dummy.  Eventually, all the cars leave.  Of course.  And where's stupid Ben?  Come on.  Ben's right here.  And then he tells the girl, come on, hang out with us.  Then we drive, and then we get three blocks from him and goes, drop me off here and leave me with her.  She was a nice girl, though.  I mean, she's an O&A fan from Holland.  Oh, that girl.  Yeah.  That makes her a nice girl because she's a fan.  I thought you were with her. 
[04:36:00]  No, no, no.  We all ate, but I had to leave.  She's not.  I don't date her.  Right.  She's just a friend.  We just, we ate.  We all ate, and then I went and did my shows, and she stayed at the bar.  You left a girl with Voss?  Why not?  What happened, Voss?  That really is true.  What happened with her?  I made out with her.  Did you?  No.  And then, Voss, is it true you're getting recognized in the middle of Times Square there?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  By black guys?  Yeah, some of the brothers, you know.  It's nice.  On their way to do a drive-by, they remember you from BET.  They were thugs. 
[04:36:30]  These were not nice, young college students.  They were on their way to attack Bernhard Goetz when they saw you.  Oh, what?  And they loved you.  Oh, yeah, you're a funny guy.  I wish I could get a tan like that.  Oh, man.  You're old Mercedes.  He hits the horn.  Man.  Where's Colin?  He's right here. 
[04:37:00]  He came into the studio.  He's having fun, yeah.  Well, he came in to defend himself about something else that happened to him.  The transgender community in me.  Oh, oh.  I long and...  Please.  He probably came up to your car and you and Norm started singing to each other.  What are you kidding?  Oh, that was nothing.  I was sleeping.  I was sleeping and I woke up.  I woke up to this.  I'm trying to take a nap.  So how's the comedy tour going?  Well, listen.  He was screaming about dollar bills flying all over.  Shut up, reshow cancellation.  Listen, that's what NBC stands for. 
[04:37:30]  Not backing Colin.  All right?  Stupid.  Oh, that was really mean.  Yeah.  Exactly.  That's hilarious.  Hey, now I'm going to make fun of your stuff and your career, your highlights.  Hey, what about that one-nighter in Morristown?  Yeah.  Hey, boss.  They didn't like that one.  At least when I book this gig, I'll find out how long it's going to take me to run home.  Boss, where are the two comedy tour dates?  We don't have any.  We're just putting out some feelers.  I thought you said you had two dates. 
[04:38:00]  Well, we might have one.  I left a message.  You're not businessmen.  Feelers.  I left a message for someone.  It's not the same as booking a date.  You just said we have two dates.  I kind of lied.  I'm thinking of calling Angelina Jolie and asking her out.  That means I slept with her, right?  Oh, yeah.  Put out the feelers.  No, no, because she doesn't have a unit.  First of all.  All right.  Stupid.  Oh, God.  I wish I was in studio for this fight.  Now, well, anyhow, look at, dummy. 
[04:38:30]  You're still in.  All right?  And what's the big deal?  I didn't come with a contract.  I just came with a little proposal.  You came with a horrible, uncomfortable desperation.  No, it wasn't.  First to me and then to Opie.  No.  You've been bothering us since then.  You know what?  You walk out of the studio and you're like, suddenly me and you were best chums.  You know we had a rift many years ago.  You were a road hack.  I was a respected insider in the Manhattan community.  The key word there is was, okay?  Let me tell you something, you two-faced faggot.  First of all, you know what Colin said? 
[04:39:00]  I'll do a tour as long as I make more than Patrice.  That's all you said.  That was your, no, I almost left.  That was your qualifications.  As long as I make more than Patrice.  And he should make more than Patrice.  I was saying that to keep it light because I was in an uncomfortable spot.  So I was like, ha, ha, let's goof on Patrice.  Let's make a joke out of it.  Because you put me in a weird, uncomfortable.  No, I didn't put you in a weird way.  Bar head sweating energy with your desperate attempt.  Shut up.  You were doing research on other tours, what other commerce are making. 
[04:39:30]  Research.  Research.  Research.  Research.  Research.  Are you doing research?  Colin was.  Colin was.  You really think that you're a businessman now, don't you?  Yeah, he does.  He's feelers and research.  No, I was and he was.  Shut up.  All right.  Stupid.  Did he come with a, did you have the proposal in a briefcase?  All right.  And did you try to open it, but your little hands couldn't move the buttons?  What did you hand Opie?  What did you hand Opie?  I didn't hand him.  Some kind of proposal thing, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you know.  And then outside the cellar, what did he say to you, Colin? 
[04:40:00]  Oh, he said, Opie's fine with.  First of all, he wasn't even going to ask you guys about the tour.  I was the one who brought up the normal thing.  I was like, you know, maybe we should ask Opie and Anthony.  First of all, you dummy, you didn't say anything.  And then you had Rick Dorfman write up a proposal.  One of his assistants wrote it up.  And then you showed it to Opie, hoping he'd read it to you, because you probably could only  read half of it.  Oh, man.  The party of the first part. 
[04:40:30]  Who's that?  Is that me?  You know, listen.  And then every gig, you're going to try and blow me out with your dirty act.  No, I'm not.  You and Patrice.  No, I'm not.  And then I'm like, Colin, we've got to switch, you know.  You're great, but then you're going to slander me behind my back to all the Jersey one-nighter  guys.  I can see it all now.  Shut up.  Here's Voss talking to Colin.  First night of the tour.  He was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Oh, angry. 
[04:41:00]  Oh, man.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  You hear that, Voss?  You're trying to book yourself high-profile MC gigs.  This really bugs me.  You know what, dummy?  Shut up.  You're on my side, so don't turn on me now.  I'm not turning on you at all.  No, all right.  You said it's a good idea, all right?  You also said it was a good idea.  He didn't know what else to say.  It was a polite thing to say to a friend.  Oh, please.  Norton pities us all that we can't even...  And you had the nerve to say, we wanted to fill your gig. 
[04:41:30]  He knows that, stupid.  You're right.  We'll be working theaters, and we'll be working funny bones.  You know what?  If this in any way gets in the way of you, we won't do it.  Jim's just sitting there pitying us all, stupid.  You know what?  You know, you're just like...  You're like a broad.  You're still doing it.  You're not backing out.  Yes, I am.  No, you're not. 
[04:42:00]  I quit.  You're not quitting before it starts.  You're still a dummy.  We're going to sponsor the Colin Quinn tour.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  You know how fast these three personalities would clash?  Voss, Patrice, and Colin.  Forget about it.  Are you kidding me?  It would be great.  It would be great shows, and it's going to work, all right?  Shows would be great, yes.  I'm talking about behind the scenes.  Someone wants to know if the tour is going to be called the ONA Midget Jew Comedy Tour.  Come on, folks.  Give him a hand, but only a little one.  Hey, Rich, the caller on the phone, not Rich Voss. 
[04:42:30]  What's up?  Hey, listening to Voss speak, it sounds like surgery.  Sucking fear.  You just want to get all that spit out of his mouth.  Shut up, stupid.  Go back to work.  Yeah, Voss.  Want to talk.  You're on the phone.  All right.  Shut up.  Make your delivery and go home.  Hey, Voss.  Make your delivery.  Voss, just like you are, I'm self-employed, you prick.  Oh, everybody's self-employed.  Yeah?  I'm a personal trainer, chef, you dumb little midget Jew.  Oh, I'm a personal trainer. 
[04:43:00]  Where?  At the, where?  At Bally's?  No, no.  For myself.  Thank you very much, Voss.  At least I can get my hands around the weights.  Probably.  You know, we give you the three-pound dumbbells because that's the only thing you get your fingers  wrapped around.  Yeah, I can get it around.  I can get around your girlfriend's breasts, too.  Yeah, that, yeah.  I'm tired of flossing whenever I'm with her.  Voss.  Voss, when you get up off the step stool, then you can talk to her.  Yeah, that was funny.  All right.  You're done.  Go back.  Voss said breasts because he's trying to show me how he can work clean. 
[04:43:30]  All right, Voss.  Get out of here, man.  All right.  I'll see you guys.  See you, Rich.  Good luck with this comedy tour.  We look forward to hearing the details.  Next time you see me, seriously, don't talk to me.  Go through my agent from now on.  More personal contact.  You know what, Colin?  I'm going to have Manny toss you if you go near me at the cellar.  I'm going to get a restraining order from Manny.  Colin.  Yes, Richard.  Yeah, there he goes.  Three attempts. 
[04:44:00]  Colin.  I'll get him.  Colin.  That's like a weight off my back right now.  Is it?  That we've outed Voss.  Has that just been bugging you?  Oh, it's just been uncomfortable, you know?  It's really weird.  And I actually think that...  This needy look.  It would be a great tour, but I know what's going to happen when I see him now.  He's going to go, what?  They said it was okay.  They said it was okay.  Everyone's being two-faced.  Two-faced.  He called Colin two-faced.  Two-faced.  You two-faced bastard. 
[04:44:30]  Just like the Bowery Boys.  You're not two-faced.  It's got a T and a D in there.  I'm self-employed.  Yeah.  Let's get some sushi.  Wow, man.  Don't tell them what I'm getting.  I almost strangled them for that.  What's wrong with you?  A French cook and two retards.  And two retards.  Don't let them on.  These are not power brokers in the industry.  They're just nobodies who are bringing you up for the fun of it. 
[04:45:00]  Mom's the word.  Mom's the word.  Oh, man.  Keep this on the cutie.  That soupy dreck.  And he said he was taking a nap and he just woke up.  That means one of his daughters had to, like, shake him.  Daddy, there's bad-mouthing you on O&M.  Oh, get Daddy the phone.  Dial the number. 
[04:45:30]  Go grab Daddy the phone.  What did they say?  Are they being two-faced?  Two-faced?  Two-faced.  Is he also light-skinned, you ass?  All right, Daddy's going to be on the phone a while.  Fix yourself a lean cuisine and a tortilla.  Tortillias.  Tortillias. 
[04:46:00]  He was alive when Kennedy was shot and he pronounced silent L's.  You know how disturbing that is?  Okay.  It's the best of the worst of the comics on the O.B. and Anthony Show.  O.B. and...  It's the best...  Boo!  The best of the worst of the comedians of the O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[04:46:30]  Just hilarious.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Really funny.  Really awful, too, by the way.  I'll acknowledge that.  Holy mother of God.  Now presenting comedian...  Otto and George.  Joining the O.B. and Anthony Show, Otto and George!  Ah, thank you.  Otto's been killing.  And George, of course, killing on the comedy tour this summer, man.  Yeah.  The next date is this Saturday in the Detroit area.  All the info is on VirusTour.  One word on MySpace.  I killed!  Destroyed.  Yeah, it was good.  It was good, man. 
[04:47:00]  I tried to antagonize those Boston pricks, you know.  I'll just right away get the Red Sox thing going.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I'm so proud of this stupid team.  Backstage.  Backstage, I was talking to Otto before he went on.  He's like, watch this.  I'm going right after him.  Yeah.  But you know what?  They respect that and they like that up there.  They like to get confrontational.  I'm still waiting for an audience to boo me, so I'm just trying to get it done before  they turn on me and stuff.  You're trying to incite it.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  I mean, it's tired just getting lapsed, you know. 
[04:47:30]  I want some...  It's fun when people hate you.  I think when everybody likes you, you're not doing your job as a comedian, you know what  I mean?  I brought the puppet with me.  I feel stupid with this thing, you know.  I don't understand it.  There's just too many comics.  At least I have a puppet.  You know what, though?  But at least you're like, you know, you're in a studio with us.  We see you.  We see the puppet.  So it kind of works.  Yeah.  I tell the story all the time.  We interviewed dumb Jeff Dunham. 
[04:48:00]  Oh, yeah.  And Peanut.  Oh, Peanut's the edgy one.  And I don't know why...  You don't know what he's going to say.  The little guy is the crazy one.  Yeah.  And I don't know why we agreed to the interview.  I don't even like the guy.  He seems nice enough, but I don't like his comedy whatsoever.  Yeah.  I think it had something to do with the bigger picture.  We were getting all the comedians from the Montreal Comedy Festival.  Oh, yeah.  So we kind of had to take guys that we probably wouldn't normally take so we could get the real  biggies, you know.  And he's on the phone doing his whole Peanut thing.  And I'm like...  A phone-in? 
[04:48:30]  A phone-in.  And I'm like, Jeff, is Peanut there?  He goes, yeah, actually, I feel like a complete idiot.  I'm in my hotel room with Peanut.  I'm working the puppet as I talk to you guys.  I'm like, why would you do that?  No one could see you.  I know.  Well, my problem is I can't get George's voice unless I'm holding him.  It's a weird mouth.  Oh, really?  The way B.B. King can't sing and play guitar at the...  I have that same thing.  Yeah.  I met Donovan when I did the Riviera in Vegas.  And, you know, he introduced himself to me. 
[04:49:00]  And then he walks away.  And my friend, Bill Sacred, goes, why don't you go talk to him?  I go, what's there to talk about?  Just because he has a puppet?  Nothing to say to this is boring.  It's kind of like when you drive by and someone has the same car as you on the highway.  You're supposed to wave or something?  Yeah, I know.  Why do I have to talk to him?  Because he has a puppet, too.  Oh, I got to tell you.  I did the Stress Factory last night.  Big A wanted to come down to the show.  And he called me up to cancel.  Like, why does this guy even have a phone?  I couldn't understand his message.  He was like, two free tickets. 
[04:49:30]  God.  It's really sad.  How many minutes do you have on your plan?  It better be a lot.  Stuttering minutes.  Yes, he has 1,000 nighttime, weekend, and blithering idiot minutes.  Hey, let's get Big A on the phone.  I want to see what that's all about.  Yeah, Big A had to cancel.  So what did you say to the Boston crowd when you came out?  Because we were busy backstage.  That they're a stupid team stinks and they only won one game in 600 years. 
[04:50:00]  And I heard a few boos, but, you know.  But that's what you were going for.  You were going for the boos.  I wanted more boos.  My hatred and stuff, you know.  They're way too into their sports up there.  They're, you know, burning down the city because they win a stupid pennant or whatever.  I don't understand.  Shooting out people's eyes.  Yeah.  Because they win the World Series.  By the way, a little advice for me.  Yeah.  Don't say you want boos because we still haven't played Philly.  Okay?  They're listening right now.  Bring it on.  I don't give a crap.  There it is. 
[04:50:30]  You don't know what you're getting yourself into, man.  Hey, they booed Dom Irera.  I mean, maybe he's old to those people, but he's a top flight comic.  They have no right to do that and they can screw themselves.  Yeah, they did boo Dom a little bit.  Schubert took a good booing last year.  Is he good, though?  He's good?  He's funny, yeah.  The worst shirt.  It was a sweater shirt.  It was the worst thing ever.  I booed him.  Really?  Yeah.  The sweater shirt?  His act is good, though.  Yeah.  Man, he's done some funny radio with us, but he didn't go over too well with the Philly crowd.  Yeah, was he all right afterwards or he took it in stride? 
[04:51:00]  He was like shell-shocked.  He's walking around backstage.  I think you only grow by bombing.  Every time you do a good set, you think you're Richard Pryor, but when they boo you, it really  brings you down to the fact that you're just this close from stinking every time.  Jimmy and I drove back to New York together after that show.  Yeah.  We couldn't get enough of making fun of Jimmy Schubert.  And we love the guy, trust me.  But you also love when someone bombs in front of your eyes, because it's just so much fun 
[04:51:30]  for you as an individual.  And Jimmy and I were coming up with all these crazy scenarios, because Jimmy Schubert's whole  family was in the front row.  He's from Philly.  Really?  And you know, they all went out to brunch the next day, and they have to kind of casually  talk about it, and he has to come up with some type of excuse why that went on in front  of his family.  Took years off his life.  We were laughing so hard.  And then, what, it's a two-hour, two-and-a-half-hour ride back to Philly.  We would not let it go.  Yeah.  We would not let it go.  He took a ferocious bombing. 
[04:52:00]  Really?  It was awful.  Worse than Burr?  Yeah, because I'll tell you what.  Different.  Different.  Because Burr hit back in a weird way.  Bill made it really funny and really like, all right, well, that's what you want to do.  As a comedian, I was watching Burr go, you know what?  If I'm going to bomb, that's the way to go down.  Oh, yeah.  Swinging and knocking their teeth out.  Swinging, yeah.  And in the end, Bill Burr did not bomb in Philly.  Oh.  I mean, go check out.  If you haven't seen the video yet, it's legendary now at this point.  It's up on all the video sites.  They loved it.  They started booing him like they booed Schubert and Don Marrera.  Yeah.  And Bill Burr said, oh, yeah, no effing way you're doing this to me. 
[04:52:30]  And he turned around.  By the end, a lot of the people in that crowd were giving him a standing ovation.  Like, holy crap, that was amazing.  They knew they were seeing something a little different.  They want to see what you're made of.  It's like playing Brooklyn or Philly's like Brooklyn.  They want to see what you're made of.  It's like, yeah.  I had, this weekend, I was like, I very rarely get nervous.  I don't get nervous at the cellar because it's my home club.  Yeah.  And I'm on Saturday late and I'm like, you know, because my manager was there and then  he brings Billy and Robin down.  And I'm like, I don't really know.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, boy.  What?  You've made fun of Billy Crystal on this show. 
[04:53:00]  I never have.  Oh, yes, you have.  Billy and Robin.  Get the Billy Crystal clips.  Do you have a picture now with Billy Crystal?  And Robin together.  Really?  Oh, you do?  Yeah, we all hung out.  Why wouldn't I?  Shut up.  He was nice to me.  He was really nice.  Yeah.  No, he wasn't.  The first time I met him, he was awful to me.  Did he talk to you in the voice?  You know, I'm just old blues singer.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Billy and Robin and I just sat there.  He's very talented. 
[04:53:30]  He's not a bad show.  Men of similar ilk.  Watch me talk like I actually know the black experience.  Watch me talk like I actually know what it's like to be a black man.  Can you dig it?  Can you dig it?  We got the can you dig it?  I knew that you could.  Can you dig that?  I knew that you could.  Wow.  He's got real disdain for one of the greats in comedy.  I don't know.  I like Mr. Saturday Night.  The makeup sucked, but you know.  Yeah, he did look like someone just threw pancake batter in his face.  It would look like pie crust falling off his face. 
[04:54:00]  It was terrible.  So self-important.  Really?  You can't stand him?  I never got into Billy Crust.  And I picked up that trumpet and I started to blow.  Yeah.  You blow all right.  Yeah.  Get out of here.  What about like John Leguizamo and that crap?  Do you hate that stuff?  Yes.  All that get up on stage, one man show.  Growing up experience.  Garbage.  I saw his one man show.  I liked it.  Really?  I liked it.  I liked it.  You're more forgiving.  He's harsh.  Oh, I can't take that drivel. 
[04:54:30]  Whoopi Goldberg.  Let me tell you something.  I'm a girl from California.  Stop it.  Yeah.  Stop.  How do you know the experience?  You don't shut up.  First of all, you're not a girl.  Yeah, right?  Let's get that out of the way right away.  When she first did that one person show, it was good.  Because it was before everybody had kind of saturated.  Was it?  Yeah, I enjoyed it.  She did a good Anne Frank thing.  Did she?  You did so many black female performers doing that thing about the Anne Frank house.  Oh, you're like the politician on the show now because you want a picture with all these 
[04:55:00]  fangs.  No, no, no.  Exactly.  He's always been like that.  Not at all.  Jimmy's changing, man.  I brutalized her on stage.  I brutalized Whoopi on stage after Imus.  I brutalized her.  Really?  Way beyond where I should have gone.  And now she's going to be doing The View.  Then again, I did take that out of the special.  Did you really?  No, like one line.  Oh, really?  What did you call her?  Wait, what line did you take out?  Cancer in a certain private area.  Oh, really?  Yeah, only because it didn't get the laugh.  I needed it to get to justify that brutality on television.  Yeah.  That would have to get a belly laugh from every person in the room and the ushers to leave 
[04:55:30]  that on TV.  Yeah, cancer.  That better be on the DVD.  Cancer's hard.  Cancer's hard.  I just, I found some stuff Billy Crystal does very funny.  Yeah.  But when he gets into those characters, I just can't go with it.  When he's trying to get pathos, I know it's sickening me.  Like he's trying to be profound with this.  And dramatic with that.  When he did that, because it was for Katrina.  I hate that, too.  It was for Katrina Charity.  And he's doing that whole black jazz artist thing. 
[04:56:00]  You know, my house blowed away.  Who did it?  Oh, God.  And he's doing this whole, like, get sympathy thing.  And all I see is Billy Crystal squinting and trying to make his nose look like a black  person.  He's not getting sympathy.  He's raising money.  Then, you know, something.  I mean, the act sucks, but the guy was raising money.  Then stand up there and do funny stuff.  Don't try to be profound.  Don't try to relate to the black man.  Don't try to make me relate because you're white and I'm white. 
[04:56:30]  And somehow that'll make the translation easier.  He's not.  He's an old Jew trying to be a black guy.  That's all I saw.  Fats Domino's floating down the river on his piano.  What is money going to help him?  Just help him off the piano.  Swim out and help him.  Money.  Better rescue him from his piano.  Hey, and it's got to be.  I don't know if we said.  There's no cursing, right, on this show?  No.  That's language.  Not for another 40 minutes.  It's a puppet back in the box.  This is my home.  Back in the box, Norton. 
[04:57:00]  Yeah.  I'm at the top of Norton.  Yeah, Little Murders.  They'll never make a comedy like that again.  Or Where's Papa?  Yeah.  Crap they're making.  Hey, how was the Letterman experience when you were in for Ventriloquist Week?  Martha Stewart was coming off and I was going.  What's your puppet?  Yeah, she goes like this.  Oh, these things are cute.  I went back to the cell, bitch.  White-collar criminal.  Hooah.  She's a hooah.  It was all right.  Letterman's creepy, though. 
[04:57:30]  You were great, though, man.  You were great on Letterman.  Yeah, go on.  Oh, no, but I swear to God, you'd think he was the real people.  He was fantastic.  Otto, you really were great, man.  Thanks.  You were you.  You didn't compromise anything.  You just didn't curse, but you were you.  Yeah, really?  Audrey Hepburn?  Yeah.  I called him Audrey Hepburn.  I did?  Yes.  I did.  That's good, right?  But I said he looks old.  I told him he's old, right?  I figured he's insecure about that.  Good.  I knew I'd never be on again.  You know, even if there is another Vent Week, I don't want to do it twice. 
[04:58:00]  He is kind of creepy, huh?  Yeah.  You should be a regular on a TV show like that, man.  Leno would have a great time with you.  Like the Man Show.  Something like the Man Show I'd be good for.  Jimmy Kimmel would be a great.  I'd be a network TV, yeah.  Jimmy Kimmel would be great for me.  If I ever get anything out of this business, I've got to come in the side door.  It's never going to be through the front.  I'm too weird.  You know, I'm too unstable also.  It's not going to be network.  I'm not career driven.  I think the missing component with me as far as becoming a big star is I don't have a need  to get approval every day or from everybody. 
[04:58:30]  I really don't care.  My dog likes me and my girlfriend likes me.  I'm happy with that.  And Otto, we've always loved you, man.  I was telling some Otto and George stories over the weekend, like back at N.E.W.  Some days you would come in and give us like an hour of just unbelievable radio.  Yeah.  Other days you'd come in and after like 15 seconds after us promoting it for like a week  in advance, all of a sudden you're like, this is horse.  And then you'd just throw your puppet in its case and walk out on us.  I'm like, what is wrong with this guy?  But we were obsessed with it.  Those were probably coke hangovers, too. 
[04:59:00]  I was partying a lot in those days.  And then you'd come back and try it again and then you'd kill.  It was just like, what the hell?  You never know, you know.  But the unpredictable is fun, though.  Like you were saying with the Boston thing, you don't want everyone just laughing.  You want some confrontation.  Yeah.  You know, some mental illness is fun.  You know, it doesn't always have to be good.  People don't get like you say you're not career driven or career motivated.  Yeah.  Most people in the stupid business aren't. 
[04:59:30]  Yeah.  But they do things like Jimmy's a smart guy when it comes to this business.  I don't think you're any more ambitious than anybody.  You just know how to put people in positions that do things for you.  Really?  Like publicists and people and managers, people that book things and come up with stuff.  So he'll have people that work for him.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, you know.  Sure, he's got to have help.  We just sit around and, you know, I know I could be doing more work than I do.  Really? 
[05:00:00]  I could be doing like voiceover stuff.  I think it'd be fun, kind of go out on a couple of jobs every now and then.  Yeah, you could definitely have cartoons.  But I don't.  But I don't.  And I don't know why I don't.  I should have.  This is your world.  This is fine.  This is fine.  Yeah.  This is it.  I don't want to spend any more time doing it.  That's all I want to do.  I want to sit here in front of the mic, do a little radio, have fun, goof with my friends,  Yeah.  And then, you know, maybe later on when this falls apart, I'll, you know, I'll be Mr.  Jangers on a cartoon show or something stupid.  You know, but for now, this is fine for me. 
[05:00:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, I'm doing a bed and breakfast this week with Trish.  No, I am.  Are you really?  Oh, wait, you're really going to a bed and breakfast?  Yeah, yeah.  Now I'm like.  You heard me talking about this story?  Yeah, she showed me pictures of the room on the internet.  Look at that quilt.  Who cares?  I'm not going to be in the room.  I'm going to be gambling in Atlantic City.  A bed and breakfast in Atlantic City?  No, no.  It's an ocean, ocean city.  I think it's like 10 minutes away or something.  Sit down, chow.  I don't know.  I don't know why.  See, bed and breakfast, you know, if you're in the mountains or near a beach-like community. 
[05:01:00]  Yeah.  But near Atlantic City.  But you said it's not, but that's.  I don't know.  She likes the quilts and stuff.  I don't know.  She's checking out the.  There's no pool.  It's the heat of summer.  There's no pool in this.  She's checking out the pictures online.  Yeah.  Stay in the Borgata.  Why don't you stay in the Borgata?  It's a great hotel.  Girls like bed and breakfast.  Bed and breakfast.  You know what I do?  Sneak into another room and put George in a rocking chair so that when people come in,  they just scream in terror.  Yeah, that's true.  These days are scary.  Scare people.  Go in there or head like when she's parking the car, just run in and squat over the pillow 
[05:01:30]  and fire a deuce.  And then she'll walk in and go, look at this.  We cannot stay in this room.  Yeah.  Okay.  It's gotten me out of like six or seven of those things.  Make pataki.  Okay.  Hey, watch out for the people that run the bed and breakfasts.  Yeah.  Usually swingers.  I know.  Really?  They're trying to get into some creepy stuff.  Creeps.  With their guests.  Yeah.  Because they constantly have people coming to their house and they're hoping, you know,  a few of these couples are going to take the bait.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's going to be some weird things going on. 
[05:02:00]  I want to get the full story after your weekend.  I just picture Lauren Bacall in The Shootist, you know, telling me, you know, I don't want  you in this house with them gunplay.  Just watch that movie.  It was good.  Hey, the helicopter thing.  We played it earlier.  Well, Danny took the audio.  Yeah.  And, well, he added a little something to jazz up the audio.  A lot of people out there going, oh, the two guys with that, you know, the anchor  laugh.  Yeah.  No, he added something else. 
[05:02:30]  So we played it earlier.  The two helicopters that went down over the weekend, there was another helicopter in the  sky and this guy gave an eyewitness report, but he was out of breath.  It sounded like he might be in the bathroom or doing other things.  God rest their souls.  But he saw something horrific and it turns out he knows one of the guys.  So we play that audio again with a little bit of enhancement here.  Holy crap.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, God. 
[05:03:00]  Oh, my gosh.  What?  Hey, my God.  Channel 15 and Channel 3 just had a mid-air collision.  They're in the park.  Oh, man.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my gosh.  Is he getting spanked or something?  Huh?  The guy actually is freaking out at the fact that he's in a helicopter.  He just saw two helicopters crash and hit the ground.  So he's freaking out.  Why is that surprising?  Those things go down all the time. 
[05:03:30]  Yeah.  The Grand Canyon tours, those things are always wiping out.  They try and keep it hushed up.  Yeah.  They smash and die all the time.  Really?  Yeah.  Screaming to their death just for a nice, pretty view.  Yeah.  Good.  I took that tour, by the way.  Serves your right for trying to feel good.  Yeah.  I did the helicopter tour over at the Grand Canyon.  Did you?  The whole time.  That's exactly what I was thinking.  You know when you get in a helicopter and your leg is chopped off and you're being airlifted  to surgery?  There you go.  Who needs to go up that high? 
[05:04:00]  I did.  With one blade.  I heard all the stories.  Who needs to go up that high?  Yeah.  There's not even a hint that these things ever crash, but they do crash a lot.  Constantly.  And over the weekend here in New York City, one of the helicopter tourist things had a  land in a ball field on 79th Street on the Upper West Side.  Really?  Yeah.  There was some smoke from one of the gadgets and it turned out it was nothing.  Yeah.  But the guy is like, screw that.  I'm taking this down immediately.  Put her down.  He landed it on a ball field. 
[05:04:30]  See that Oshkosh air show?  A couple of little problems there, too.  That's near Chicago?  Yeah.  There's always...  I know somebody who was at that.  There's a girl I know.  There's always a problem.  Yeah.  And this year, no different.  A couple of guys died.  Remember Vic Morrow, the great actor?  Ah, yes.  Whacked his head right off.  Him and a couple of Vietnamese kids that got on the cheap.  Yeah.  Well, Steven S. from Bayshore is suggesting that these two helicopters went down at Vic Morrow  Park.  Yeah.  His last words. 
[05:05:00]  My hat!  Here's...  Wait, did the kids die, too?  Didn't it?  Oh, yeah.  They were all decadent.  One of them was crushed by the weight of the helicopter and the other one was cut in  half and Vic Morrow's head was whacked right off.  Vic Morrow lost his head.  Is that in the script?  No.  They didn't give Vic that page.  No.  Are you sure I'm supposed to do jumping jacks here?  Trust us.  It works.  That's the beauty of this day and age.  There's the Oshkosh disaster. 
[05:05:30]  Yeah.  Right up there on YouTube.  Hey, here's more of Danny's audio enhanced.  Big tower.  Time off.  Yeah.  Just a minute collision over here at the park.  Two helicopters.  Two helicopters down.  Oh, my God.  It's channel three.  Channel three.  I don't know who. 
[05:06:00]  Channel three.  I don't know who else is.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It looks like channel three.  I don't know who else is.  I don't know who else is.  I don't know who else is.  It looks like channel 15.  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  Okay.  Twelve.  I got you inside.  I'm stuck.  You know what?  Yeah, I'm good.  I just watched that whole thing. 
[05:06:30]  I'm good.  I'm on your nose.  I'm good.  I'm stuck.  I'm good.  Oh, my God.  Take it with Scott.  Wow.  Jesus.  That sounded, uh, that's a little different.  Yeah, just a bit different.  That was like porn.  Almost.  Almost.  We used to let a little time go by before we started messing with the story.  Yeah, now it's just bad.  That's a short bereavement here.  Yeah, right.  The O&A show.  I obviously feel bad for the people involved and everything, but this is just one of these 
[05:07:00]  things, again, that the news is catering to America is just a bunch of vultures that  want to see these car chases up close.  I'm guilty of it.  When there's a car chase on TV, go, go, shoot him, kill him.  I want to see the cops pull him out and just blow his head off or something.  That's our nature.  And the cop their view.  So we all want to see this.  They cater to it.  You know, they give it to us.  And when you get five helicopters in the area hovering over one car, it might be a problem. 
[05:07:30]  Not sure which way the car is going to turn, so the helicopter is going to turn drastically  at every turn.  Our true nature is rape and slaughter, you know.  That's it.  This is all an illusion.  This is some weird illusion that's trying to put this blanket of goodness and political  correctness over us.  And all we are are animals that love to see death, destruction.  And all that.  How much were you laughing when you saw that Iraqi soccer victory dance they were doing? 
[05:08:00]  Oh.  They're shooting their weapons in the air.  After winning the soccer match.  After winning the soccer match.  It's the first time Iraq has won.  You know, they're a war-torn country.  They're very proud of their soccer team.  Yeah.  Which, by the way, the last soccer team, one of Saddam's kids had put to death for losing.  So the whole team got tortured and put to death.  That's a motivator, isn't it?  Yeah.  Wow.  So they won.  Well, it worked.  They won.  They won.  Jesus.  And then as their little victory thing, like we do here in the States, they fire their 
[05:08:30]  AK-47s up in the air.  And the bullets come down.  Four people dead.  17 wounded from gunfire.  You make it sound like we don't do this in America.  We do this in America.  No, we tip off the cards and light them on fire.  Yeah.  We do some crazy crap, too, when our team wins.  And occasionally the cops have to shoot an eye out with a beanbag.  Yeah.  But, I mean, just civilians out in the street firing machine guns into the air.  So the bullets came down and killed four people.  They're going that fast just from dropping? 
[05:09:00]  Yeah, I guess that and maybe a few people didn't shoot high enough.  Didn't shoot high enough, yeah.  Into buildings?  I don't know what the hell they're doing over there.  They got to lift their gun in the air?  Wow.  Just start shooting.  Hi, it's Otto from Otto and George.  Ottoandgeorge.com for any upcoming dates and merchandise.  Laugh.com.
