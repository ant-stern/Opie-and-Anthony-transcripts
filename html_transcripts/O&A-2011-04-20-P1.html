<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with a self-deprecating intro acknowledging their controversial history, including FCC violations and show suspensions.  They immediately launch into mocking NYC's relaxed rules on kickball and day camps, calling them "retarded."  A lengthy, scathing review of a *Meet the Parents* sequel follows,  peppered with crude language. The hosts dissect the film's perceived flaws, focusing on the acting (Robert De Niro, Ben Stiller, Barbra Streisand, Dustin Hoffman), directing, and a particularly memorable scene involving De Niro's character's erection.  They repeatedly call the movie "horrible" and a "pile of shit."

The tone shifts as Jim Norton enthusiastically reviews the Broadway play "The Motherfucker with the Hat," praising its vulgarity, strong acting (Bobby Cannavale and Chris Rock), and hilarious plot.  The show then covers a news story about a fight at a McDonald's job fair escalating into a woman running over people with her car. The hosts express shock and disgust using offensive language, and briefly comment on Fox 8's overuse of the word "exclusive" in their reporting. They end the first segment with a humorous anecdote about a hamburger stolen by a tornado.

The next segment begins with a vague mention of a shooting. A caller, Allison, complains about the prevalence of "temp-to-hire" jobs,  a sentiment Opie relates to his early radio career.  Workplace anecdotes follow, including underpaid lawyers and chaotic fast-food experiences, particularly a vivid description of a brawl at Chuck E. Cheese.  Jimmy recounts a story about apparent indifference to a possibly injured person in the street.  A large portion focuses on Bobo, a one-man band whose upcoming performance the hosts are hesitant about due to his performance style and tendency to talk over others.  The hosts mention receiving multiple communications from Anthony's stalker and tease a new PFG TV episode. Opie's driver, Kenny, is discussed for his seeming lack of reaction to a possibly deceased person in the street; a later caller, Pete, clarifies the individual was likely intoxicated.  The segment concludes with an extensive discussion of Anthony's harassment by a woman, including playing a voicemail and reading numerous texts showcasing her persistence and delusion.  A brief discussion of Lady Gaga and Bill Donohue's criticism of her work is also included.

The following segment opens with Anthony detailing his year-long harassment by a woman, despite his attempts to block her.  Listeners who've contacted the woman themselves are discussed, highlighting their playful interactions with her.  Anthony jokingly encourages further interaction to lessen his own harassment.  A Scorch's PFG TV segment follows, mocking the low-budget production quality, small audience, and Scorch's self-promotion.  His app's purported success and his "Bar Wars" trademark are also ridiculed.  The "Mob Wives" cast from VH1 then join the show. They discuss their show's perspective on the female side of mob life, reactions from Staten Island residents, and the misrepresentations often seen in media portrayals. The "Mob Wives" remain in studio for the next segment.


The final segment features an in-studio conversation with several women whose lives have been impacted by relationships with men involved in organized crime.  Renee Graziano (daughter of Sammy "The Bull" Gravano), a woman whose husband is a burglar, and Karen (whose husband was involved in criminal activity) share personal experiences. They discuss the emotional toll of having loved ones in prison, public scrutiny, and the difficulties of explaining their situations to their children.  The conversation touches on the media's portrayal of mob life, the loyalty felt towards partners despite their criminal activities, and the challenges of raising children in this context.  The women openly discuss their husbands' crimes and prison sentences, referencing specific individuals like Sammy "The Bull" Gravano and John Gotti.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny and then it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get crazier, the better.  Yeah, yeah.  What, are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show's on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck.  I have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Morning.  Hi.  Yeah, there was some palaver.  Everybody.  New York backs off rules on kickball tag and day camps.  Good.  That was retarded.  Yay, we get one back.  That was a retarded story.  From the idiots.  Gotham, they lower taxes, though. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, yeah.  Why do they have to ruin that?  You know.  You get your taxes in.  Did we do any tax breaks this year?  No.  No.  Good.  We're improving as a radio show.  Everyone knows it's annoying.  So, I guess the health officials were embarrassed by everybody and said, okay, okay.  It really was everybody that was talking about this was just saying, come on.  Especially wiffle ball.  Wiffle ball was the one that made a lot of people laugh.  How is that dangerous?  You could get, someone could pitch a wiffle ball as quick as they possibly can and you get 
[00:02:00]  smashed right on the bridge of the nose with it and it won't do anything.  No, I guess they're thinking maybe the plastic bat that hurt you.  Well, the way we used to use it.  We used to fucking fight with those bats.  No, I mean the wiffle ball bat challenge.  Oh, right.  That could probably be an issue.  Even that wasn't that dangerous.  No.  Our stats were pretty good.  We only injured one girl.  And it wasn't even really an injury.  It was discomfort.  And we weren't the ones pushing that day. 
[00:02:30]  She felt some pressure.  From her drunk friend.  Yes.  Trying to pound that thing up there with a mallet.  God, you think a girl would understand another girl's inner workings.  Yeah, you can't get that all the way up there.  I think I can push it in further.  Really?  Oh, my God.  Up a floppy and tube.  What's wrong with you?  And that was the end of that bit.  Yeah, that was done.  How's everybody today?  Good?  Oh, wonderful.  Wonderful.  Yeah.  Wonderful. 
[00:03:00]  I was well-rested yesterday because I came home and decided, you know what I'm going  to do?  I am going to pop in, or actually, it used to say pop in.  Remember the old days, it used to say pop in a movie?  Sure.  Because it was a disc or something.  Well, I got it off of On Demand.  Little fuckers.  Yeah!  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He did it.  So I wanted to see.  Is this my night?  This disjointed fucking actors in 20 different places, never interacting with each other 
[00:03:30]  movie.  Who brought this to your attention?  You're going to make believe I don't exist?  No, no, no.  Wait, was it the...  Have you seen the second one or no?  I've never seen the second one, so I don't want to see the second one.  I saw the second one, which was certainly a drop-off from the first one, but watchable,  I would have to say.  First one was good.  I liked the first one.  It was funny.  Original, funny.  Second one...  Drop-off.  Nah.  Third one.  Now, I watched it yesterday. 
[00:04:00]  Or, I might say, watched part of it.  How much did you watch?  A majority.  Did you get to see some of the stuff I was telling you about?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then, I fucking fell asleep, because it could be the worst movie made, aside from  Caddyshack 2.  Right.  Which will always, in my heart, be the worst movie ever made.  I don't think I laughed once in this movie.  That's what I was just going to say, too.  And even bad comedies, you get a couple chuckles or a couple scenes that you're like,  Oh, that's kind of funny. 
[00:04:30]  Even like a...  Yeah.  Not once.  It was...  I wasn't smiling.  I was sitting there like I was being interviewed on First 48.  There was not a smile...  Nothing.  Just...  I was sitting, and I realized I have not even thought about chuckling this whole time.  When Dustin Hoffman, they go to him, and he's doing that dancing thing in Spain, the flamenco  dancing.  The flamenco, right.  It was embarrassing. 
[00:05:00]  Well, that's the excuse why he wasn't going to be in most of the film.  He was in Spain learning how to flamenco.  Right.  Right.  And Barbra Streisand, who's...  Oh, she's got the sex show.  Look out.  Yeah.  She's talking penises.  Yeah.  Oh, stop it.  She had to talk to Dustin Hoffman, but she talked on the phone.  It was on the phone.  So she's separate from the movie, because she's on her TV set talking to Dustin Hoffman, who's  in Spain, so he's separate from the movie set as well.  The first time you hear all three of them, they're on the phone. 
[00:05:30]  They're on the phone.  Oh, right.  Ben Stiller was in that scene, right?  And Ben Stiller is in his car on his little headset phone, and there's a three-way conversation  going on where you know there was just somebody else feeding the lines to these people.  Sure.  And they pasted it all together, and you can tell.  You can, right?  You can tell, even just through dialogue over a phone, that these people had no interaction.  No one seemed to have been in the same place at the same time. 
[00:06:00]  Right.  So why...  It was amazing.  Why make the movie?  Why don't you wait until you can do it properly?  It was horrible.  And then did you see Ben Stiller's wife all of a sudden had the flu?  Yeah, she had the flu.  And there's no reason why she should have the flu in this movie?  Now, that is the only bone of contention I had with your theory on the whole thing.  Okay.  Because it did seem there was a reason.  What was the reason?  So that Ben Stiller could go to the youth school there, the school for the kids, with 
[00:06:30]  De Niro.  So?  Like, that was...  But that was the big thing, so those two could go together.  They were forced to now go together instead of him going with his wife.  Like, I think that was...  Because then there was some funny gags at the school where they thought they were gay.  And, you know, he's just looking at the school in his weird little way.  So that's why I think they did that.  Did you see their faces digitized? 
[00:07:00]  No, I was done by that point.  Oh, De Niro's face was all, like, smoothed over nice in that scene.  And it was creepy looking.  Very, very odd.  And did you see Dustin Hoffman, like, go to the gate of the house that was having the  kids' party, but he wouldn't go in?  And that part, I was asleep on, too.  Oh, that's too bad.  So I...  Because that was the big one where it was obvious he wasn't part of this movie at all.  It's a two-day pay-per-view.  So I'll be able to watch the second half. 
[00:07:30]  No, you saw enough.  You didn't laugh once, right?  Not a single, even close to a chuckle.  And what was the godfucker thing all about?  Oh, because they thought it was funny.  They were trying to do some kind of godfather mob thing, but it wasn't working.  Yeah, because obviously De Niro and his connection with the godfather being in it, the godfather  too.  And then it's like, oh, the godfucker.  And they couldn't just say it once.  Right.  And be done with it.  Right.  They had to say it at least eight times. 
[00:08:00]  Did you get it the first time?  Are you ready to become the godfucker?  The godfucker?  The godfucker.  Well, what does that entail?  Well, you have to do this, this, this, and be the godfucker.  Godfucker, I'm ready to be the godfather.  All right.  We get the joke.  It sounds like the godfather.  Oh, God.  It was infuriatingly bad. 
[00:08:30]  And the only reason Ben Stiller was going to be the godfucker, I can't play their game.  Yeah, yeah.  It was because the other guy is no longer in the family, because what, he got divorced  from?  The doctor, yeah.  The doctor.  So he wasn't signed for the movie either.  No.  Because he was in a bar somewhere that Ben Stiller kind of bumped into him.  Yeah, yeah.  So that guy wasn't even part of the filming either.  How do you have a movie where everyone in it makes a cameo?  They all made cameos.  It's just a cameo movie.  Right.  It's horrible. 
[00:09:00]  It really is a pile of shit.  Yeah.  I wish you saw it, Jimmy.  One of the worst movies.  You should have saw it when the movie was first out, obviously.  Well, it's on pay-per-view now, and people, I'm sure, will be watching it.  But you see people just being pasted into this movie.  They're doing their scenes completely separate from everyone else.  And then, oh, you didn't get to the end of the movie.  No, why would I?  The producers obviously realized, holy shit, these characters haven't been in the same  room with each other. 
[00:09:30]  So they threw them all in a room.  They threw them in.  They got them all together for one quick.  I don't think the scene's two minutes, as the credits are basically rolling, as they're  opening gifts around Christmas.  It's like a fast-forward scene, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  They realized, fuck, we better get all these people on set at least for a half a day.  It was awful.  I don't understand why they would make a movie like that.  In some people's eyes, it's a great franchise.  It's made a shitload of money.  That's why.  And they completely blew it.  Fucking wait until everyone is available to do this correctly. 
[00:10:00]  I don't even think people like Dustin Hoffman would be available for that movie.  You don't think so?  No, I see it as...  They just lucked out getting them for the second one?  Right.  They thought it would be a lark.  De Niro, you know, it's his film company and shit, and he's a producer on it.  So obviously, he's got an interest in it.  Did you see the boner scene?  No, that was right before, because I noticed the kid had to go to sleep.  Oh, that was a terrific scene. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, that's where I fell asleep.  You got the great De Niro with a fucking huge boner in his pants.  Yeah, yeah.  And then Ben Stiller has to awkwardly take care of the boner.  I saw that in a trailer.  Because he's a nurse, and he happens to have a needle that'll fucking pop his boner.  Of course, yeah, yeah.  Dude, you got to see this movie.  And then, of course, you got to have the kid walk in.  It's so bad.  And he was doing that.  He just looks terribly old and not cool. 
[00:11:00]  And, like, you know, then there's the little reunion thing between him and Keitel,  because they've done movies together over the years.  Keitel was great in this movie.  Yeah, Keitel.  He was only on screen for a couple minutes.  I'm like, fuck, make the movie about Keitel.  He played his character.  He was digging a hole in Ben Stiller's backyard.  I'd rather watch that.  Keitel did his job, you know?  And Jessica Alba was good to look at, but fuck.  Yeah, that whole...  What did she have to do with the first two movies?  Nothing.  It was so bad.  I would put it up there as one of the worst comedies I've ever had. 
[00:11:30]  I would absolutely put it up there.  I'll see it, absolutely.  I'm trying to think of one part, one part, where I might have thought about chuckling.  Did you see when the truck backs up and all the sand...  Oh, yes.  Wasn't that hilarious?  Robert De Niro was buried in sand.  Buried in the sand.  And only Owen Wilson's character could save him.  Owen Wilson gets him out.  Oh, boy.  You didn't like all the cameos?  It was a whole film of cameos. 
[00:12:00]  Everyone, and you could just...  You felt that no one was talking to anyone at any given moment.  No, no.  Terrible comedy.  I'm glad you finally saw it.  Yeah, I saw enough.  I couldn't believe how bad it was.  You expect that from a new comedy, not part of a franchise.  Yeah.  But then again, I guess they do ruin a lot of franchises.  Always, man.  Always.  Horrid.  But this is a major drop-off on the other two.  Each one just gets worse and worse.  And that was bad.  That could have killed it right there.  You think Hollywood knew it was a bad movie and they said, look, just throw it out there. 
[00:12:30]  We'll still make a shitload of money off this thing.  Of course they do.  Or are they delusional and they don't realize how bad it was?  There's no one sitting in a screening room watching that final cut going, yeah, that's good.  Wow, is that fucking brilliantly funny.  Did you see the part where Owen Wilson's hair went from short to long?  No, I missed that too.  Fuck.  You might have to watch the second half.  But I saw him on, now that part isn't when he was on the TV, right?  No.  No, he was on the TV at first. 
[00:13:00]  No, also there was a scene with him and Barbra Streisand that didn't really make sense.  And then, I'm like, this scene's a little weird.  And then he goes back outside to the kids' party and he has long hair.  And I'm like, they grabbed, it looks like they grabbed something from the second movie.  From the second movie.  And pasted it into this movie.  So they could have Streisand in there more.  So they could have her in the movie more, I think.  Oh, God.  I don't know for sure.  I would doubt it.  But why would they make that mistake where his hair's short and then long?  They don't care.  Sometimes they do make those consistency errors where they just, you think you're done shooting 
[00:13:30]  and then you've got to come back and shoot something.  But these movies, yeah, they don't take too long to film anymore.  And they don't even care.  You don't really get a chance to get your hair growing long.  Guaranteed.  If they were like, hey, we got a shot here where we can fit Streisand in from the second movie.  Right.  Oh, well, Owen's hair's a little long.  We don't get, hey, believe me, just having Streisand in is worth it.  The trade-off of us looking dumb by having two different hairs. 
[00:14:00]  Put it in.  Right.  Just put it in.  You'd think they would have that shit figured out in Hollywood.  No.  I mean, we don't have anything figured out here, but you'd think in Hollywood they would.  No, same fucking idiots running everything.  Yeah.  I'm glad you saw it finally.  Yeah, yeah.  I had to fucking pop that on and I was just, I couldn't believe I wasn't getting one, even  a snicker, nothing.  I wasn't even thinking of laughing.  Because it's the same, they're trying to do the same fucking jokes.  Same dumb jokes.  With the, I'm watching you.  Well, guess what? 
[00:14:30]  Now I'm watching you.  Yeah, look out.  Because I have more confidence in this family.  Oh, look out.  And then one of his kids has to be stupid and the other one's bright.  It's so hack.  Did you see when the stupid kid fell?  Trying to climb the fucking wall?  No, look, I see.  I didn't see that.  I think you were falling asleep.  I was probably dozing.  I thought I had made it through about half.  I thought I had made it through about half.  Well, if you made it to the school, then the kid makes the drawing of what he thinks  of his parents or something and it shows Ben Stiller, you know, popping a boner. 
[00:15:00]  See, I just made it through the part where they went to the school to interview to see  what the school was about.  Yeah.  And where you see the lovely Laura Dern.  She's aged well, huh?  Wow.  I'm just thinking, all right.  I remember her from like, you know, Jurassic Mask and Jurassic Park.  She was pretty much a child actress.  She's been around for a while.  At one point.  And now it was like, wow.  Okay.  She's a grandmother. 
[00:15:30]  It happens.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  But how old is she now?  I mean, I mean, like 78.  Oh, I thought she was younger.  I'm very bad at age guessing.  I was voted least likely to guess in age properly four years in a row.  Four.  Yeah.  I can't control if you have the thumbs down on it.  Well, I was busy watching the Knicks lose another one last night.  Fucking the first time the Knicks have been in the playoffs in a really long time.  And, God, the Knicks.  Another close one, I hear. 
[00:16:00]  Another close one, yeah.  But, I mean, you know, we got hurt players all over the place.  Is that the problem?  Celtics look old to begin with, and we can't fucking beat them.  How's Ewing doing?  Did he get any points?  Ewing's doing terrific, yeah.  He came off the bench.  That's all I know.  But I tweeted a picture for Jimmy, especially, because I'm watching the game.  And we've bitched on this program, certainly.  I mean, we're looking at it right now.  All the shit they got to add to a fucking TV screen. 
[00:16:30]  Yes.  And they went too far last night, because at one point I really thought Conan O'Brien was playing for the Knicks.  They had him in the middle of the fucking game.  They didn't even wait for a commercial where they could pop it on.  Maybe the players are walking off the court when you have a little time there.  Yeah.  Or maybe a free throw where the action is stopped.  Now, this was one of those cutesy things where he walks out from the side of the screen.  And it's kind of a live action, Conan moving thing. 
[00:17:00]  I guess, because I thought maybe it was a Knick player, and then also it was Conan, and then he's near the three-point line.  I'm thinking, wow, maybe they really have taken advertising to the point where they made Conan play in the game.  Where they made him show up and put him on the fucking floor.  But he was giant, and the play was going on.  Yeah, they do that now.  They bring people off the side of the screen, and then they put a logo, and then they have the guy looking up at the game, and he's looking around.  And then it says, you know, Conan O'Brien at whatever time, and then he walks away. 
[00:17:30]  No, this was almost in the middle of the screen.  It wasn't on the side where you'd kind of go, what's going on?  Oh, there's something going on on this side of this little part of the screen.  It was like almost front and center during a play.  Well, that's the problem, too, because the problem with the standard definition and high-def TVs, they can't just have them come into the side of the screen because then the people with the standard definition miss that.  Right.  So they have to have them come in far enough onto the screen where the people with ancient TVs can still see it. 
[00:18:00]  And we all have to pay the price, even though we paid the price already, with a nice widescreen TV, which by now, and I'm not even talking like a rich person, any douchebag could walk into a Best Buy and buy a fucking widescreen television now, HDTV.  For nothing.  They're cheap as fuck.  Yep.  Anyone can get one.  Yep.  Why is any station catering to standard definition anymore?  And let me tell you something else that pissed me off. 
[00:18:30]  Last night, when I was purchasing the little fuckers.  It sounds like fuckers.  I know.  Isn't that hysterical?  I inadvertently hit SD, standard definition.  Oh.  So I had to now go back and buy it again in HD.  Oh.  So I paid for that fucking piece of shit movie twice.  Right.  Because SD, the standard definition, was still there, even though I got it in the HD slot of my pay-per-view. 
[00:19:00]  You know, my on-demand.  Mm-hmm.  So I go to HD movies, I find little fuckers, I click on it, and it still gives you the option for standard or HD.  Oh, really?  So I just hit go.  Yeah, you didn't know.  No.  And I'm like, fuck, man.  You thought you were in the HD section of the beginning.  And then I realized that half the screen's clipped off on the side.  I'm like, what the fuck, man?  Can we stop with standard definition television?  It's 2011.  Just drop it already.  Save the bandwidth.  I knew Fios was bad.  See, they fucked you yesterday. 
[00:19:30]  No, it is one thing, though, that they need to...  They need to work on a little bit.  If I go to the HD section of movies, I click down the very, very amazing menu that they have.  And I click down the side, and it says movies, all movies, and then it's like HD movies.  And I only go to HD movies.  I don't even look in the other movies.  Why would you?  Why?  I have HD.  And then you go down the menu, and I find little fuckers, and I click go, and then I click purchase.  And it's like, there shouldn't be a standard definition option in there, because I went 
[00:20:00]  to the HD screen initially.  Fuck standard definition.  Do away with it, for God's sake.  Who's left?  Old fucking people watching their stories.  Yeah, because even the poor people get a nice TV.  Of course they do.  They're a certain type of rich.  They don't care.  Holla.  They pay the money.  What's that, Dan?  Did you guys know anybody back when the 9-11 attacks happened?  Absolutely, I knew people. 
[00:20:30]  That didn't have cable or anything, and they just had rabbit ears.  Rabbit ears.  And so when the plane hit, their TV went out, and so they just didn't know what was going  on.  Yeah, so they had no clue what was going on, because the antenna was on top of the trade  center.  I knew a few people.  Of course.  A few great grand people that I just knew that were associated in my life.  They had no idea what was going on.  And all of a sudden, the picture went a-kablooey.  But that's the people that I think the news are catering to when you have those standard  definition feeds.  It's the minority of people. 
[00:21:00]  It is.  You're not talking about the majority of people.  The majority of people now have TVs that can handle HD, widescreen, whatever the fuck.  Enough.  Enough already.  Enough.  And what I'm saying about the news, a lot of times you'll see on the news channels, they'll  put their logo way to the middle of the screen so that people with standard definition televisions  can see it.  A great example is if you like sports, check out ESPN and HD.  And a lot of times, with footage and stuff, they'll show you all the sports footage in 
[00:21:30]  standard definition, like 4x3.  And then on the side, that fills up the remainder of your television.  It just says nice, big graphic that says ESPN.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's kind of moving.  It's like, look, we see, we're still widescreening it.  And it's just filler so that you don't have black bars on the screen.  Right, yeah.  At least they figured that out.  I used to hate those black bars.  I can't.  Now I can't wait for the 21.9 TVs.  Imagine what that's going to look like.  21.9.  When is the 21.9s coming out?  It can't come out soon enough. 
[00:22:00]  What is the 21.9 going to look like?  Awesome.  Are you kidding?  What is it going to be?  Crazy.  Is it going to be wider?  Yes.  What is it?  It's cinema.  It's cinema aspect ratio, 2.35 by 1.  A TV?  21.9.  So these TVs are going to look stupid in another year or two?  No, they're going to look awesome.  No, these, I mean.  Oh, yeah, they're going to look ridiculous.  The ones we got.  These already look ridiculous because they're like four inches thick.  Their shitty plasma TVs are terrible.  Hey, man.  What's a good one?  We're holding on to our plasma TVs.  Not that, like the LED LCD, like the nice thin Samsungs that are like a fucking sheet 
[00:22:30]  of paper.  I like my plasma.  I hate the fucking silver plasmas around the top.  Mine is black around it.  The silver is distracting on TVs.  There should be no silver around the screen.  It should always be black.  Yes.  Black, black, black.  This is a 21.9 television.  Oh, that looks stupid.  You're insane.  It's sick.  It's fucking sick.  That looks just ridiculous.  Yeah, I would hate to watch a Blu-ray movie taking up my whole TV screen.  Oh, yeah.  That would be ridiculous.  Who needs that?  I love those black bars on the top and bottom.  You do?  I don't enjoy them.  When are we doing the 21.9s? 
[00:23:00]  You said not soon enough.  I need a date.  These were supposed to be out last year because they were announced at last year's CES.  So I'm hoping that either Phillips or Vizio has these out by the end of the year.  All right.  That's good.  Good to know.  And then you got to wait for, you know, the people that...  I'm not getting 3D.  I might need a new TV soon and I will fucking wait it out.  Yeah.  Wait it out.  I'm suspicious with that 3D shit.  I don't care.  I don't want it.  I don't think they're ready.  I'll never use it.  Have you noticed...  3D TV is ready for prime time, yeah.  They're not making as big a fuss about 3D movies as they were after Avatar. 
[00:23:30]  After Avatar, everything was like...  3D, 3D.  You know why?  Because you still have to wear those fucking idiotic glasses.  Yes, the glasses.  The glasses.  They're uncomfortable.  They're not comfortable.  I can't imagine watching a two-hour movie wearing those.  Did you go to Avatar?  No.  The glasses weren't bad.  They were okay.  They weren't bad.  They were like sunglasses compared to what they used to be.  Yeah, they were a lot easier.  They were like a nice, light, plastic sunglass.  It's a completely different technology because the TV...  It wasn't bad.  The TV glasses are heavy.  They take batteries.  Oh, no.  I know all that.  You know?  But we were talking about movies. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Why aren't they doing 3D movies all of a sudden?  I don't know.  They backed off a little bit.  It's probably more expensive to do, said the guy who had nothing to add.  Yeah.  I just have no idea what I'm talking about.  If it's shot in 3D, then it looks good.  But what a lot of these movies do is they shoot regularly, and then they just add the  3D after the fact, and the effect isn't as spectacular as if it was shot in 3D in the  first place.  I'm sorry.  Everybody had such poor viewing experiences.  Oh, it's just awful.  I had a wonderful viewing experience.  You did? 
[00:24:30]  You went to a play?  I went on a date with...  Real people?  Yep.  That's exactly...  Did you know her?  You went on a date?  Yeah.  Baba Khali, her name is.  She's a...  Baba Khali, she's...  From the Middle East?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's an Arabic girl I've been seeing.  Oh, my God.  Baba Khali?  Baba Khali.  She's really sweet.  She has very good skin.  Skin hasn't seen the sun? 
[00:25:00]  Not at all.  Oh, my God.  Good personality?  Lovely personality.  But what about the body?  The body's not as good as it could be.  Her hair is a bit thin up top.  You know, she's really an odd...  She's always like,  I want to make love to you, dude.  Baba Khali.  Baba Khali.  And it was wonderful.  We met outside the theater.  Yeah.  And we saw...  Louis was there.  It's funny.  We saw Louis there with his close, close friend.  And I hadn't seen Louis in a while since the last time he was in. 
[00:25:30]  And so the motherfucker with the hat.  And it's Chris Rock's play.  Fucking amazing.  Really?  Dude, amazing.  And plays are weird to me, like...  Because I'm...  It's a different acting.  It's harder to do than movies.  Sure.  The theater acting is...  Sure, we all know.  We've been in a million of them.  Oh, yeah.  I haven't been in a play since fourth grade.  I was in one.  I said, maybe we should have him dry cleaned.  I don't remember what my line...  But I remember that was my line. 
[00:26:00]  Oh.  And I had three lines.  Did you say it that adorably?  Yes.  Do you remember the play?  I do not know.  But there was somebody...  One of the kids was dirty.  And mine was...  I was before fourth grade.  It was probably second grade or first grade.  And I said, maybe we should have him dry cleaned.  I don't remember.  Were you in Annie?  No, I was not.  Daddy Warbucks?  No, I was...  What the fuck?  It's...  So what's the Chris Rock play all about?  It stars Bobby Cannavale and Chris is the second Billy. 
[00:26:30]  I was surprised he wasn't top bill, but Cannavale, I guess, is more of a traditional theater actor.  Fucking...  Who was Bill Top?  Cannavale.  Bobby Cannavale.  Oh, okay.  Am I saying it wrong?  Yeah, no.  And...  He was in The Other Guys, right?  Is that the guy?  He's been in everything, dude.  He's been in a lot of shit.  He's a real theater guy.  Because he almost stole The Other Guys.  He was really good in it.  And I was thinking to myself, if it's the same guy, I'm thinking, they should have gave  this guy more scenes.  I looked up his resume last night. 
[00:27:00]  And wasn't he in Louie?  He might have been.  I haven't seen the Louies.  I don't know.  I just want to know if it's the same guy.  I just saw Louie live sitting there.  I didn't see the show.  Most people wouldn't care about my questioning.  No, it's just curious because he's...  I think, if it's the guy I'm thinking of, he's ready to fucking be a huge star.  He's...  It's about, let's just say, I'll tell you, it's about a sober guy and his relationship  with his sponsor and his girl.  And it's so fucking good.  And Chris is great. 
[00:27:30]  He's fucking great, man.  It's like, whenever you see a stand-up acting...  All right, Robin Williams isn't a fucking Juilliard actor.  You expect him to be good and he's good.  But Chris was like, he fucking...  He was in a Broadway play and was as good as anybody on...  It was really bizarre to see...  Like, you immediately forget that you're watching Chris the stand-up.  It was fucking odd how fast I got...  That's all the compliments.  Honestly, man, how fast I got pulled into this thing.  And...  I actually, at one scene, it bothered me so much. 
[00:28:00]  I actually went,  Oh, I fucking did the audience noise thing.  No, yeah.  Not objecting, but it was like the reaction you were supposed to have.  Right.  They got you.  Fuck, they got me.  I was like, oh!  I couldn't believe what they did with one of the characters.  It disappointed me a lot, but...  Oh, wow.  But not in a performance way, in a...  Fuck!  I didn't want to see that happen to that person.  You should have called me.  I would have waited and saw this place.  Honestly, it was...  I would have waited and saw this place.  Sherrod and I, Sherrod's his cousin, and we had been talking. 
[00:28:30]  Sherrod's whose cousin?  Chris's cousin.  Like blood?  I don't know if...  They share blood?  I don't know if it's blood or lifelong, we're cousin things, but they're...  But it's like a cuz.  Yeah, like, they're like family.  Him actually might be blood.  Grew up in the same...  But, like, you know, the guy that's always there.  He's family.  And, uh...  Oh, I forgot what I was gonna say about...  Oh, you're more than welcome to go.  I'm sure he'd love to fucking have you come.  It was, uh...  And Annabella Scurie, I always say her name horrible. 
[00:29:00]  Of course, she was in Jungle Fever.  She played the one that Wesley sniped with Frank Vincent's daughter when he threw her out.  Oh, boy.  She was good?  Fucking tremendous.  I knew it was her, but, like, she looks too young to be Annabella.  And, uh...  I recognized her voice.  And there was a guy who played, uh...  I can't remember his name, the guy who played Cousin Julio.  There's only four or five or six people in it.  Every one of them is tremendous.  And the guy that plays Cannavale's girlfriend is fucking great.  It's like the laughs were there, and they were fucking...  I know I'm...  I don't want to give anything away. 
[00:29:30]  I'm really doing a bad job of selling it.  I was blown fucking away.  I see...  That's why I'm not asking questions.  I see that you're bobbing and weaving.  Yeah, I don't want to blow any of the...  I don't basically want to say a lot, but you realize maybe I shouldn't.  It was very...  It was so well-acted.  It was, uh...  The dialogue was very organic.  It was...  It's like it did not do what I wanted it to do.  I'm a sucker for certain type endings.  We all like to think that we're not.  Yeah.  But we are.  Mm-hmm.  Fuck!  They did not do what I wanted them to do.  Oh, really? 
[00:30:00]  But that...  But it was real.  It was fucking...  That's the way real people talk.  That's the way fucking real people are.  Oh, it was fucking...  Dude, I thought about that.  It was all night.  I was like, fuck...  I had a dream about it.  Wow.  It was fucking phenomenal.  Can't recommend it high enough.  What theatry are they in?  It's on 45th Street.  I probably should know.  Bobby...  Baba texted me the...  Baba Kali.  Baba Kali.  Texted me the...  Baba Kali.  I'll tell you what theater it's at.  It's...  I cannot recommend anything higher than this for live performance. 
[00:30:30]  I want to go tonight.  I want to go tonight, then.  It's the Gerald Schoenfield Theater.  It's 236 West 45th.  It's between Broadway and 8th.  I'll talk to Shrod.  I'm sure that's doable.  Yeah, I want to go.  Today's Wednesday.  He's doing two today.  Really?  I saw him afterwards.  Yeah, we spoke for a little bit, and he...  Tell him to do our fucking show.  You know, it's funny.  I was...  He's done our show.  I came into the dressing room, and I sat down.  We were just talking for a minute, and then fucking four of the people came in. 
[00:31:00]  I was like...  I had, like, five minutes alone with him, just talking, and I was not expecting other  people, and then it was, like, I think a sports agent or somebody he knew, and then  there was, like, a couple of people in the dressing room.  It was, like, four of the people.  Yeah, he works out of my gym, and his locker is literally five away from me, and I still  haven't talked to him.  Dude, you should say...  You should talk to him, because...  I've seen him a few times.  I don't...  I don't know.  Dude, I do...  I don't know where we're at with him.  I'm the same...  Celebrities are weird, like...  And I don't want to bother him, either, because he's too busy, you know, doing the training  thing.  If you see his play, and you go up and tell him you like his play... 
[00:31:30]  Literally, when I...  After talking to him last night, I'm guaranteeing, just from the conversation we were having,  there was no way it was a snub of this show.  It's all publicist shit or timing.  He's doing Oprah tomorrow.  I just want him on the show.  Yeah, I would love to have him.  He beat up Patrice last time.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he really fucking...  He really changed Patrice's fucking...  He woke Patrice up a little bit.  But he's doing two today, and then he goes...  He's like, I guess he's flying to Chicago tonight, and then doing Oprah tomorrow.  So he's got it busy. 
[00:32:00]  That's nice.  But, dude, it was so...  So rave reviews from Jim Norton.  I was blown away by this play.  And what's the name of the play again?  The Motherfucker with the Hat.  And...  How do they put that on a poster?  That's a little dangerous.  They...  Mother...  A little dangerous.  F, asterisk, asterisk.  I think...  Yes.  I don't know if that's...  I don't know how well it's doing.  I don't know how plays are judged.  I mean, it was a very big crowd last night.  There was only a couple of open seats.  It was mobbed.  But, uh...  Was it opening night?  No.  No, it's been going for a couple weeks.  He said he's rehearsed for two months. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, I wasn't sure if it was just in previews.  To hang in there with those people.  I don't mean just hang in there, like, do a serviceable job.  But he belonged in that role.  Right.  Like, as the sponsor.  He belonged there.  It wasn't like, oh, look, they're giving Chris a role because he's famous.  He belonged in that fucking role.  I could not believe how fast I was taken out of the fact that I was watching...  Is it Chris's play?  Did he write this?  No, no, no.  I forget who the playwright is.  Oh, wow.  They just picked Chris Rock.  Yeah, he just got the game.  And, uh, the fucking...  I could not believe how good the acting was in this. 
[00:33:00]  It was nice to be sucked into a fucking role and really care about the characters and laugh.  I fucking laughed out loud watching this thing.  That stupid Broadway's got it figured out.  Fuck, man.  I mean, I don't go to Broadway shows.  Except for Spider-Man.  But every time I go, I have a really good time.  Yeah.  I go, fuck, they know what they're doing down here.  They really are.  You got to be good to be on Broadway usually.  Even though some of those dumb musicals...  I wouldn't search out a musical, but all of a sudden, I don't know, something happens,  you find yourself in these musicals, you go...  It's a little catchy tune. 
[00:33:30]  It's like, fuck, this is damn good entertainment.  You know what I mean?  But Broadway humor is usually different.  Like, it's usually geared towards different...  It's always like, you know...  Like, you know, that fucking...  I didn't say a word, but everybody kind of knows the vibe I mean.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  Well, get out of here.  Well, I'll be back tomorrow.  Well, will you?  And I'm like, no one's laughing.  Mr. Faber-Sham.  That's what it's like to me.  This was fucking brutal fucking dialogue. 
[00:34:00]  It was fucking...  It was like a movie.  And the crowd...  It's inspirational to see fucking crowds laugh at that shit.  There's one line where the fucking girlfriend is screaming at Bobby Cannavale.  And she's like, you know me, I'll spit in a nun's cunt if I feel like I'm wrong.  And the crowd laughed.  And I could not believe that.  It just came out of a fucking live performer's mouth.  And it got a laugh.  If I said that at the cellar, they would lynch me.  Yeah, they would, huh?  But it was like really fucking brutal fucking funny dialogue. 
[00:34:30]  You fucking sold me.  Honestly, I can't recommend it high enough.  Are they doing a show right now?  I want to leave.  I'll leave right now.  I don't know what...  Dude, it's weird.  Let's just go.  Matinees to me are weird.  Are they doing a breakfast show?  But it's like whatever they are.  Cool.  Matinees are fucking daytime shows, which are just bizarre to me.  But I guess on Broadway, Wednesday and Saturdays are matinee days.  Colin said he hated doing matinees because it's a stand-up.  But this is not stand-up.  It's different.  It's daytime.  Yeah, but people go.  That's when people on Broadway know to go in the fucking day.  Well, yeah.  When we were doing afternoon drive and I was taking that train from Long Island, it was 
[00:35:00]  filled with all the older fucking women going to their Broadway shows.  Do you want to go tonight?  Just yipping and yapping.  And I would have to stand the entire time because they have every fucking seat on the  train all coming in for Broadway for the matinee.  I'll talk to Sherrod.  Yeah, I'll go.  If you want to go.  You should wait until the weekend though so you don't have to get up in the morning.  Uh, no, I'm, uh, weekend is, uh, the Easter thing.  Oh, right.  You got Easter around the corner.  Forgot I'll be watching fucking Ozzy's documentary on Easter Sunday. 
[00:35:30]  Really?  That's exactly what I'm doing.  That's awesome.  While everybody looks for fucking spheres.  What are they called?  Spring spheres.  Fuckin' this country sucks.  I'm offended.  Don't allow this to happen, you idiots out there.  I'm offended as a Catholic that they would put a Satan worshiper special on Ozzy, a documentary  on Easter Sunday.  Yeah, that's not good.  That offends me.  Yeah?  That offends me, yes, because he's a Satan worshiper.  We all know it.  He's a very sweet man. 
[00:36:00]  And I'm very happy that they're doing it on Easter.  I didn't even know.  I'm actually going to fucking put on bunny ears and make Easter rabbit noises the whole  time I'm there and yell yay and hop around the theater.  I know they made noises, but.  That's how happy I am.  Hey, before we go to break, we got Jason in Cleveland with a big story that is happening.  People are talking about.  Oh, yeah.  That's a biggie.  Uh, Jason, what's going on, brother?  Hey, there's a McDonald's here in Cleveland yesterday that was having a job fair, a job  day, so a bunch of people showed up, and a couple of ladies got in a fight, and one 
[00:36:30]  lady got pissed off, got in the car, put it in reverse, and ran over four people right  in front of the camera.  Yeah.  Yeah, I saw that one.  She killed them, or are they just?  Injuries.  Wait, what happened?  What happened?  McDonald's is doing this thing.  They were, like, giving away 50, not giving away, but hiring about 50,000 people at pretty  much all their stores, just trying to, uh, boost up, uh, you know, boost up the, uh,  employment.  Give people that, uh, that beginning step in, uh, the working world. 
[00:37:00]  So in this economy, they're, they're actually hiring.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's pretty rare.  That's seven and change an hour.  Okay.  But, uh, you know, as opposed to zero an hour, I guess that's good.  Mm-hmm.  But, um, oh, boy.  Oh, the people that were showing up.  I saw quite a few clips, and, uh, well, let's just say, uh, ah, ah, ah, seem to be a lot  of people that, uh, probably, uh, more for the money, uh, more for the free food than 
[00:37:30]  the money, I think, that were there.  Give me the job so I could take home some fucking, uh, Big Macs.  Is there video of this?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Uh, there was a, uh, a melee, uh, a little fight happened.  I don't know what happens.  You get a group of people together, always seems to be some duking it out happening.  I don't get it.  There was a certain McDonald's that were, was hiring, and too many people showed up?  A lot of people show up.  For applications?  And, um, you know, I guess instead of standing in line in an orderly fashion, there was some 
[00:38:00]  type of, um, brawl going on, and some woman, uh, got in her car and, uh, put it in reverse  and just started running people over.  Did she panic, or did she want to run people over?  Oh, I think she wanted to run some people over.  There we go.  Look at that line, huh?  Oh, Jesus.  Hoping to land a job.  Oh, this fucking guy.  Three kids.  I hate this voice.  Yeah.  It's the worst.  It's the AP guy.  The world's biggest fast food chain held its first national hiring day with plans to 
[00:38:30]  The guy said he's got three kids, and he's looking to get a job.  I would love to make it to manager if I get the chance.  If not, I'm blessed with the fact that if I make it to anything and get any job.  You know, it's going fairly well.  You know, we were a little surprised by the turnout.  Totally excited about it.  Um, we appreciate everyone coming out.  Yeah, it looks great.  People are looking for jobs.  Donald painted the event as a boon for the economy.  Oh, don't say that.  Millions are still out of work.  But the chain usually staffs up for the summer during this time of year.  And industry experts say it's really an effort to paint the company as a good place to work. 
[00:39:00]  I hate this fucking guy's voice.  I started 13 years ago working 10 to 2.  Part-time job just to make a little bit more money.  Should anybody be working at McDonald's 13 years?  No.  Jesus.  Ray Kroc.  Most restaurants are owned by franchisees.  And they, not McDonald's, determine wages and benefits.  One company executive says...  This is a boring story.  This guy stinks.  Where's the good stuff?  Do we get to the running over of... 
[00:39:30]  But people talking about a McDonald's...  I'll be blessed to have a job about a McDonald's job.  Like, that's sad, man.  It's fucking...  Oof.  Yeah, well.  Jesus.  World needs stitch-diggers too, you know.  I know.  Cleveland is just not the fucking hottest place.  Oh, God.  I like Cleveland, but...  Here we go.  Oof.  There it is.  All right, we got the exclusive.  If they don't have a booster seat.  What?  If they don't have a booster seat.  Man, this kind of situation...  Oh, the poor kid wasn't in a car seat. 
[00:40:00]  Why do I have to see that?  Well, catch Kyle's story at boosttillate.org.  Yeah.  It's an event aimed at hiring thousands of local people.  And please say a fight between two women at the McDonald's National Day of Hiring got out of control.  Oh, no, there's a hair on the...  There's a hair weave in the garbage pile.  And as I was filling it out, I saw two girls fighting.  I don't know their names, but they were fighting over drama and hood stuff.  The fight went down at the McDonald's on 105th and St. Clair. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, boy.  We say it started verbally, then physically, and then spilled into the crowd.  After that, witnesses say the unthinkable happened.  The girl on top of the driver was beating her, put the car in driving, and went forward.  That's a brutal shot.  The car went in reverse.  It rolled all the way back and hit three people.  It was crazy.  Another eyewitness captured the actual hit and run on his cell phone and showed it exclusively to Fox 8.  Watch closely here. 
[00:41:00]  Whoa.  What the fuck is she doing?  He's ran some motherfuckers over.  Why did she need to get out of there?  The eyewitness described what it was like from his vantage point.  Somebody got in the car, backed up the car, and pummeled like maybe four or five people.  Among the three injured were people who worked for McDonald's and were just trying to help.  The owner-operator was injured breaking up an incident.  I'm not, you know, we're going to cooperate fully with the police here.  There's nothing more important to us than the safety and well-being of the people. 
[00:41:30]  The building was immediately closed, and the National Day of Hiring suspended temporarily.  A disappointment for the hundreds of people who came out for a new opportunity.  We trying to get people jobs, and this is the way people act, for no apparent reason.  And make it bad for people like me and for other people who cannot get jobs.  Yeah, man.  She's trying to get a job.  Yeah, she's trying to get a job.  Fuck.  If you show up and wait online at McDonald's to get a job, there's something to be said.  If anyone that will wait online in that shithole, there's something to be said for that. 
[00:42:00]  It's fucking just oof.  Jesus Christ.  Just Jesus Christ.  You get enough people in one area, and there's always a fight.  There just seems to be a problem there.  I don't fucking know.  Let's see.  What did I think of during that haul?  I saw something during that clip.  The fucking guy backing up.  The hiring.  Fuck.  What did I think of it?  I forgot to say it.  Oh, sugar.  Oh, boy.  Black people?  No, that wasn't black people, I don't think. 
[00:42:30]  It was about, oh, how much it annoys me that they had to go Fox 8 to show it to us exclusively.  Right.  And then it says Fox 8 exclusive on it.  Exclusive.  It's like, do you understand what that is?  Like, they're saying, hey, it's important that he told us we're the only ones that have the video of the fucking people being run over.  Yeah, you just lucked out.  And the viewers don't give a fuck.  You're not that special to them.  Why is it important that it's exclusive?  What does exclusive mean?  Like, why do we need to know that? 
[00:43:00]  I guess it used to be important.  I don't know.  It's simply.  If you were the only one that had footage of JFK getting his head blown off, that's an exclusive.  Like, holy shit.  You know, no one has this footage.  But a dumb story like this, to use the word exclusive, is stupid.  Do you think Zapruder would be mad if he was around today for all that stuff?  Everybody ripping off his video and uploading it as their own on YouTube?  Like, check out my JFK TV video.  Of course.  Of course.  But why is that important?  It's like.  It's not anymore. 
[00:43:30]  These scumbags are saying.  But it's their way of, like, fucking taking that tragedy and using it to boost their own fucking product.  But the media has been using it forever.  When we were growing up, I think it meant way more than it does now.  It's just, to me, it's hijacking something and making it a. . .  Trying to make it your own.  Making it your own so you further your fucking. . .  Trying to tell the people we're the better news station because, look, we got this exclusive.  No one else got this.  But the fact is they lucked out in getting it. 
[00:44:00]  It's about being competitive with the other stations.  It's not about just bringing news to people.  Otherwise, the exclusivity means absolutely nothing.  Well, not just stations, though.  But, I mean, think about it, too.  From the news station's perspective, they have to compete with everything.  So in such an environment where media is just flooding you at all times, to get an exclusive like that is kind of rare.  Because why can't I just go to YouTube and see that video?  But, you know what, if Fox 8 or whatever, if they have that video and I can't find it on YouTube, good for them.  Yeah, but if you play it out, they're hoping now you're going to watch Fox 8 because they happen to have the McDonald's exclusive. 
[00:44:30]  They have the exclusive.  And I don't think people think that far in advance.  They don't give a fuck.  They just happen to be watching the right channel at the right time.  They're the same people that are going to see Paul Blart, the mall cop, and making that $100 million movie.  So people are retarded.  But if we do something wrong, the point is, like, if you make fun of something, all of a sudden you're a fucking bad guy.  And they'll be all over you for that.  But that is how they take something horrible and they use it to further their own brand name or cause. 
[00:45:00]  It just sickens me.  And I like to just point it out because that's what they're doing.  Yeah.  I don't mind them having an exclusive.  I don't care.  Just don't think that what you're doing as news people is different than any other form of entertainment because it's not.  They're trying to own it.  McDonald's hires 50,000 people every summer.  This promo is bullshit.  And what is it, part-time employees so they don't have to pay the full-time benefits?  Oh, is that it?  There's got to be some kind of weird loophole there.  Sure.  Sure.  I didn't even know.  There used to be a thing when I was coming up in the radio business and I had to have other jobs. 
[00:45:30]  It was called temp to hire.  Yeah.  Where you had a full-time job.  In my case, it was for Xerox.  Oops.  Sounds frustrating.  It was horrible, but I was in shipping and receiving and we were called temp to hires, which basically meant you had a full-time job, but they didn't have to pay you the benefits or anything.  No benefits.  And they had a shitload of people that were temp to hire.  And to hire.  And they never hired any of us officially.  That meant that you could get a job if you do good. 
[00:46:00]  I had the gig for, I don't remember anymore, but probably over a year, maybe a year and a half, they never even attempted to hire anybody.  And they were called temp to hires.  And that was just because they didn't want to pay the health benefits and everything else that comes with a real full-time job.  But you had a full-time job with this company.  Yeah, I had one of those too.  You did, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  For me and my buddy Bill D'Angelo.  I love when you use real names.  Fuck you.  Bill, yeah.  I saw him recently.  And we did attempt a higher job.  I think it was a full-time job.  And some, I know there was centrifuges and sludge. 
[00:46:30]  I don't remember what else was done.  Oh, my God.  I was so, Bill was handy and I was so bad at it.  But they gave us like these cardboard boxes to cut with these box cutters and I wasn't doing a good job.  And Bill goes, come on, Jim, you should be good at this because I'd cut myself so many times.  But, yeah, that was a full-time gig.  But I think that it was like it was from a temp agency.  Right on.  All right.  Yeah, we got the hamburger guy.  Oh, yeah.  It kind of fits.  Yeah.  Yeah, but this thing has been making the rounds. 
[00:47:00]  It's not like it's like laugh out loud.  But you know what?  It's good enough, especially to go to break with.  After that story.  After that story.  Guy claims a tornado took his hamburger.  ...to toss cars and 18-wheelers around and destroyed homes.  16 WAPTs made pace was there right after the storm.  What was going through your mind?  I don't know.  I wasn't going to die.  Eric Hubbard was sitting in a friend's car eating lunch when Friday's tornado came barreling toward them.  It was standing and it got big going up. 
[00:47:30]  Dog, when it hit the ground, it kept coming up.  I was going to get out of the car and run in.  Hubbard thought about making a run for his house, but his friend talked him out of it.  And I was scared.  I was going to eat a hamburger.  It took it.  And I don't even know where it's at.  It took your hamburger out of your hands.  Hamburger for the drink.  I don't know where it's at.  I don't know where it's at.  Took my hamburger for the drink.  That's almost really good.  I don't know where it's at.  Almost.  He just misses.  That's not going to be the next who got shot.  Who got shot?  Who got shot?  So, what the fuck? 
[00:48:00]  Let me say hi to Allison.  Hamburger.  Allison, what's up?  Hamburger.  Hamburger.  Hamburger.  So I made it.  Took it.  Hamburger.  I'm supposed to have that on my machine.  I need hamburger.  Allison.  Hi.  Hey.  I just wanted to call real quick.  You were just mentioning how when you were working, when you were in the workforce, basically,  everything was temp to hire.  And you had this job and they never hired anyone.  And that was how it was when, you know, you were in the workforce. 
[00:48:30]  I just really need to let you know that it kind of sounds a little jaded because that's  basically everyone coming out of college right now.  Yeah.  That's why I'm bringing it up.  I don't think it ever went away.  But it's bullshit by these big companies that they hire temp to hires and they never hire  anyone.  It's a way around paying benefits.  Yeah.  I mean, I have people.  I'm working in a huge company right now and I have people who have been working there  for literally five years and have families and can't get jobs anywhere else and people 
[00:49:00]  refuse to hire them.  And it's just.  Yeah.  I mean, just to give you a little more info, I didn't think people really cared about this  point.  But when I was coming up in the radio business, I didn't know where I was going to go if I  was actually going to like have a full time job or make real money.  And I was in Rochester and Xerox is a at the time was a great company.  And if you do get hired by Xerox, it's a good living, a really good living.  But then they had a bunch of schmucks like me and a lot of us that they put a little hope 
[00:49:30]  in our eyes, but never fucking gave the real job to anybody.  Were you putting the new cover sheets on those TPS reports or because that could be a problem.  I wasn't shipping and receiving, but I had visions of moving up the corporate ladder.  Is it good for the company?  Right.  So you.  I wanted the corner office.  I didn't realize you worked in a paper store till it blew away.  Paper store.  Paper store.  Yeah, this.  I don't know.  I don't know, man. 
[00:50:00]  I don't.  If you're graduating college, good luck to you.  It's it's fucking horrible out there as far as getting a real job with real benefits.  Yeah, I mean, I mean, benefits.  The company I'm with, we have attorneys working for us who are literally making $20 an hour  and are lawyers.  What do you.  They're coming out of law school.  What kind of what kind of company is it?  It's a technology company, but I'm working in the legal department and the immigration.  Are you an attorney?  No.  Oh, sorry.  What do you do? 
[00:50:30]  What do you do in the thing?  In the thing.  In the legal department.  I literally sit on Excel all day and, you know, work on visas and stuff like that.  Okay.  Tort reform.  Sorry.  I just wanted to yell some lawyer stuff.  Tort reform.  Tort.  I sometimes do whatever the law comes up.  I yell legal terms.  I don't mean to.  It just happens.  Take a Tourette's thing with me.  Yeah, no.  It was totally appropriate.  Roe v. Wade.  Sorry.  Apologize.  Yeah, I was hoping it would change after all these years, but I think it's gotten worse 
[00:51:00]  where they really just fuck over their workers and give them real jobs, but don't give them  the benefits to go along with that or an actual salary that, you know, you could be proud of.  Absolutely.  It sucks out there.  Yeah.  All right, Allison.  Thank you.  Motion to dismiss.  Ooh.  Lawyer Jim.  Denied.  And did you want to say, tell them to behave or what?  You were a little low key in that whole McDonald's thing.  Well, you know what it is.  You're letting your people down.  It's a double-edged sword for me there because they were there trying to get jobs. 
[00:51:30]  So, but it just seems like when there's a large group of people, there just seems to be a problem.  People or blacks?  I don't know.  What are you going to say?  I will say a large group of certain people of certain ethnic background.  There just seems to be like these problems that perk up.  There's so many all over the intranets.  There's so many of these where you just see, and there's a little group, and fast food play. 
[00:52:00]  Chuck E. Cheese seems to be an MMA ring for black people when they're having parties there.  That is, Chuck E. Cheese is an amazing place to go see a fight.  And the kid, one woman's pulling her kid out, and then she puts her kid down and runs right back into the melee.  Right.  And it's over some piece of shit stuffed animal they were giving away or something.  It's always some dumb gives me that crap.  Ah, enough. 
[00:52:30]  God, enough.  Behave.  Well, we'll do a little bullying to behave for you.  Oh, really?  It's a break, yeah.  Jimmy's laughing over there at something.  What story?  The umbrella story?  No.  It's like, I know who's right and wrong in this story.  Hold on.  Let me see if I know which one is.  But I'm going to tell you, fucking dummies walking around this city thinking they have  protection around them because they live comfortable lives.  Ah.  Fucking.  Homeless guy.  Bitch.  Wait, wait.  Save it for the break.  Learn to shut your fucking mouth. 
[00:53:00]  Save it for after the break, Jimmy.  Holy shit, you fucking nudgee New Yorker.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they're everywhere.  We'll talk about that.  Wow, did she get her comeuppance?  Oh.  Also, also, I don't know what to do with this.  He's sitting there.  Bobo, the one-man band, he's been on hold for an hour.  I'd put him on hold for longer.  People are begging, where the fuck is Bobo with the one-man band thing today?  I was telling Ant before the show, I mean, we could do whatever, but I'm thinking we  might blow up. 
[00:53:30]  Yesterday's bit was really good.  It was great.  And for all the Bobo haters, you picked the wrong day to go on Twitter and beat the shit  out of the kid because he fucking performed yesterday.  Yesterday was great.  You wait for a really bad performance.  That's how it works.  And then you beat the guy up.  Oh, believe me, you'll get one.  Right.  And probably today if we do this.  Right.  If you want to be a real hater, then you've got to figure out how that works.  When we have a shitty show, that's the day you fucking beat us up.  Yeah.  Not when we have a great show.  And you don't beat up Bobo after he has a great appearance.  His appearance yesterday was probably the best one yet. 
[00:54:00]  And then there were people on Twitter trying to beat him up.  He's like, you're stupid.  You picked the wrong day.  So I'm thinking if we go to him and it's not good, it's going to fuck up a great bit that  we had yesterday.  See, Danny's nodding.  That's why I didn't go to him.  I don't know what to do.  The reason Bobo is on the phone is because he wants to do yesterday every day for the  rest of his retirement.  Right, right, right.  Yes, and he is the one that has a 99% chance of fucking it up. 
[00:54:30]  So we could do it.  We could do it after the break.  We could try.  Can I say, though, let's be honest here.  It's not exactly a sequel to Citizen Kane that we're talking about here.  It's Will the Retard bang on the pots and pans as well as he did yesterday.  What do we really have to lose or gain?  You bring up an amazing point there.  This is not like, hey, guys, we have the holy grail.  We hate to wreck it.  Dummy made noise.  Dummy will make noise again.  All right.  Jimmy's there.  Jimmy's always the voice of reason. 
[00:55:00]  When has Bobo ever disappointed where you go, well, you know, you go, I don't know what  else Bobo's going to do for this show.  That's true.  And then he does something else.  I'll tell you when he's disappointed.  When a fucking doctor was holding him by the ankles and I'd slap him and his mother  went, oh, how did that thing fucking pop out of my hole?  They told me it was normal.  For the record, I've loved Bobo every fucking time.  I have not.  Not every time?  No.  Half the time.  Oh, yeah, at least.  But I hate the way he fucking talks over everybody. 
[00:55:30]  It's like, would you shut up?  No timing.  It drives me nuts.  It drives me nuts.  Really annoying.  But I do like the kid.  And I think people give him too hard.  He's a lot funnier on the show than some people give him credit for.  But I couldn't take him every day or even once a week.  He drives me nuts.  All right, so we'll do Bobo's one-man band after the break.  And I must say, I did receive a few new texts and a voicemail.  Oh, fuck yeah.  I have a new voicemail.  From your stalker?  Oh, yes. 
[00:56:00]  All right.  And the whole thing is hysterical because I will tell you the times of these texts and voicemails.  And what is said in the voicemail and the text makes no sense with the time of the text.  You'll explain that whole thing.  Yeah, yeah.  And I got a tease, too.  I think I saw a dead guy this morning.  And I need the NYPD to help me out.  I need to know if this guy I saw this morning was dead or not.  And new PFG TV.  What?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:56:30]  Holy shit.  We don't have enough time in the day.  Oh, my God.  New PFG TV.  Speaking of tease, though, whenever your arms go up and the shirt lifts a little bit and shows that firm belly, that's a bit of a tease every time.  I just want to run my fingers over.  So alabaster.  Sorry.  No reason to say that.  Sam, new PFG TV.  Is this the one where he goes after us a little bit?  I watched the whole episode.  He didn't make mention of the New York radio duo.  What happened? 
[00:57:00]  I thought it was coming.  I thought it was going down.  But this is one of my favorite episodes.  Wow.  Really?  For sure.  Yes.  He gets into some good topics and stuff?  Well, by topics, you mean paid mentions.  Yes.  Now it's just awesome.  That's all it is.  We have no guests today.  So we have time to do PFG TV.  Oh, good.  So Ant Stalker.  Yes.  Jimmy's, what do you call it?  The pesky New Yorkers?  Or the keep a mouth shut.  New G New Yorker.  It's called Learn When to Shut Up, Lady. 
[00:57:30]  And if we have any NYPD guys, if you could get a hold of us, I'd need to know if this  guy we drove by this morning was dead or not.  You've got to tell them maybe what area.  Upper West Side is good enough.  Yeah.  Right.  I'll tell the story next.  It's quick.  But it just shows that Club Soda Kenny is a fucking robot.  He won't even stop to see if a guy's dead.  Nah, really?  What's wrong with this guy?  I wouldn't either, though.  Huh?  I wouldn't either, to be honest.  You know, it's quick, actually. 
[00:58:00]  He's driving me in, and I see a police cruiser just stopping with their lights on.  And in front of the police car, in the road just off the sidewalk, is a guy twisted in  a way you shouldn't be twisted, even if you're passed out, drunk, or if you're homeless, laying  in the street right off the curb.  So it's like in what they call the gutter?  So I go to Kenny.  Is that guy dead?  And Kenny barely looks and goes, it happens, and keeps driving.  It happens. 
[00:58:30]  It keeps driving.  Like, any one of us would at least slow down, maybe even stop and take a look.  Nothing.  He doesn't even put his fucking foot on the brake.  He just goes, it happens.  And we just ride by this scene that is taking place.  Because Kenny's dead.  It's not a big deal if he sees another cadaver.  Does he have any emotion?  Two zombies running into each other.  Vampires aren't as surprised by other vampires as we are.  You hang out with him way more than I do.  Does he ever show any fucking emotion, ever? 
[00:59:00]  This guy, it wasn't, it didn't look like it was a homeless guy.  It obviously looked like something was happening here.  And it didn't look good.  The time he'll show emotion, like sometimes if he's eating a steak, he'll actually, I've  seen this before, just like that, when he's a mouthful of fucking meat.  So it's delicious.  He'll occasionally make the yummy sound.  The yummy sound.  Or if you like his fucking finger by accident instead of a cigar, he'll run through the door. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, he really, he really, he likes violin music and he hates when I toast him with our  fucking, with our wine cups.  Would you have had a better reaction than it happens?  The most emotion you don't see out of Kenny is when you show him a fire or a flame, then  he'll run away quickly.  Or a little girl on a swing.  Yes.  When I said, is that guy dead or whatever, that, that was a cue for Kenny to slow down  or fucking stop. 
[01:00:00]  Nothing.  Nothing.  You would slow down, wouldn't you?  No, I'm at the point now, I got to be honest with you.  I'm at the point now where I don't slow down or stop for shit.  But I get mad when people do.  It's just, get the fuck out of my way.  Yeah, but I got to explain.  It's a, it's a side street.  It's really early.  There's, there's no one out there.  There was no one out there.  No one behind us.  No one in front of us.  Then I'd slow down.  I'd give a look.  And the cop obviously has its lights on. 
[01:00:30]  So you're thinking, oh, cool.  I'm going to see something nice.  Yeah, maybe.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Given that.  But then we had the dummy down in Washington that, that did the, uh, the opposite.  Remember, I liked her too.  Uh, what was her name?  Uh, Meg or something.  Megan.  No.  Megan.  No.  Who was it?  Megan.  Megan.  Remember when she picked us up from the hotel to bring us to XM and there was a shootout  going on?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And she stops the XM van with our, like, oh, with the, with our faces on the side.  Like, man, maybe we should keep going. 
[01:01:00]  That one.  We were like, will you get the fuck out of here?  Remember the, the cops were all behind their doors with their guns out and they had their lights  on a store?  Yeah.  We were like, uh, it would be nice to say this, but, uh, let's move along.  Let's move along.  I don't think this van is bulletproof.  So you got to know when to slow down and stop.  Today was a perfect fucking opportunity to slow down and see some shit.  Kenny.  It happens.  It happens.  They hadn't put the get the fuck out of here tape up yet.  They just got there.  Oh.  So now hopefully some NYPD can tell me, uh, what was that situation about? 
[01:01:30]  It was on the radios by now, right?  Well, where was it?  You should give the location.  They find dead guys every day.  It was, it was right up, uh, you know, the hill.  It was, uh, it was, uh, a mere hundred feet from, um, where, uh, you know who lives that  works for the other show.  Oh, I know exactly what you mean.  Wow.  Yeah.  I mean, precisely.  Precisely.  Yeah.  Per second.  Per second. 
[01:02:00]  Per second.  In front of.  Oh, I know who you mean.  No, I know.  The woman's building.  In front of that.  Oh.  Right there.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, sure.  So.  Yes.  Hmm.  All right, whatever.  Oh, this guy could help me out.  All right, he'll help me out during the break.  All right, uh, so we got a lot to do.  Uh, here's Kenny.  Jogging.  It's too late now.  Oh, wow.  Look at him running.  Giant suit.  Holes in the floor.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Kenny.  Hi, Kenny.  Welcome aboard. 
[01:02:30]  It's in the 2-0, if anybody.  It's in the 2-0?  Yeah, 20th Precinct.  All right.  I know what the 2-0 is.  Why don't we slow down and take a look, Kenny?  You just don't care about stuff?  I thought he thought we were talking about his IQ.  In the 2-0.  No, then he would have threw the decimal point in.  Sorry.  2.0.  A-boo.  A-boo.  Well, there's nothing we could do for the guy.  You don't like checking shit out?  You just went, it happens.  He's seen so much shit.  The guy's body was twisted in a weird way, though, Kenny. 
[01:03:00]  Kenny probably ran him over on the way to get you.  Because he was going to be 30 seconds late.  You know what a homicide detective's motto is?  What?  Our day starts when your day ends.  That's a great one.  I need that out of show.  I like that.  Yeah, they should say it starts when you get too tired to do anything but die. 
[01:03:30]  Fucking chip.  That's a good one.  Chip, it is a good one.  Holy shit.  All right.  Just play bowling.  Donald's employee got to eat bowling before behave.  The virus.  Get in touch with the Opie and Anthony show.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  Send your feedback to feedback at OpieAndAnthony.com.  Opie and Anthony.  You ready for the one-man band? 
[01:04:00]  Oh, I don't know.  You want to give this a try or what?  Well, I guess.  Bobo was on the show yesterday.  It was going nowhere fast. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  And then we realized in the background, his mom and sister were getting very angry because  it was early in the morning and he was making too much noise on the phone and they were getting  pissed.  So we kind of picked up on that and had them bash pots and pans together while singing the  Meet the Mets, Greet the Mets song.  It was classic.  It was funny.  It was very funny.  And I think we could really have him screw up his one moment.  This is the typical George Costanza not knowing when to leave the room. 
[01:05:00]  We've done this so many times in our careers.  And we're on a high note.  We can't just leave it alone.  And I'm out!  But the interesting part of Raymond that missed it is the discussion that was going on of  should we leave well enough alone or should we tempt fate?  As if somebody was saying you should splash some more color on the Mona Lisa and you two  were discussing it like, well, you know, it is a work of art and I don't know if we should  tamper with it.  Yeah.  I know. 
[01:05:30]  A retard banging pots and pans.  Exactly.  Clang away, stupid.  Not as good as yesterday.  Click.  All right.  What's this story about?  Give us a fuck.  But we were thinking of the possibilities.  Oh, that's great.  This has legs.  Bobo.  Right.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is Bobo's one-man band.  It's a kazoo and pots and pans forming New York, New York.  All right.  Let's get right into it.  Well, I get, you know, he wants to get right into it.  Bobo, you do understand that this. 
[01:06:00]  He does.  I can't really recognize the song, you know. 
[01:06:30]  No.  Sounds like a retard with a kazoo.  I wish that was someone beating him over the head with a mallet. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  Put it over his head like Johnny Appleseed.  Fucking hit him with a fucking mallet, like you just said.  Bobo.  Bobo.  Bobo.  He can't hear us.  Bobo. 
[01:07:30]  Bobo.  We've heard enough.  Bobo.  Bobo.  Bobo.  Bobo.  Yeah.  Oh.  Hi.  Where is your mother and sister?  Bobo.  Oh, there are three.  Well, how come? 
[01:08:00]  Where are you?  Oh, no.  I was in my room.  And they can't hear you from your room?  No.  Then why are you doing the bit?  See, the whole, the whole.  I'll do it.  All right.  I'll go to the rest of the song right here.  Where are you?  Why is he doing the bit if no one can hear him?  If no one can hear him.  See, he thinks that the bit was him doing a song.  Right.  No. 
[01:08:30]  It's him annoying people at his house.  Can I answer the question that you both asked with such incredulousness in your voice?  Why would he do the bit?  He's dumb.  I don't know.  I mean, why would the retarded guy banging pots at seven in the morning not do it correctly?  Well.  Because he's dumb.  Bobo, we're going to give you a big fail for today.  But guess what?  What?  You come back tomorrow and hopefully you do this properly.  Yes. 
[01:09:00]  We want you to add more instruments.  Yeah.  Yeah.  More instruments that are very loud.  Yeah.  And not in your fucking room.  Right.  Yeah.  Yesterday was a big win for you.  Yeah.  I would dare say epic.  Today we give you a big fail and tomorrow we give you another shot.  Right.  All right.  And there's something I want you to do during the song, too.  Yeah.  While you're playing, I want you occasionally to go,  Ra-cha-cha-cha!  But really loud.  Ra-cha-cha-cha. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Did you like that one, Jimmy Durant?  Oh, yeah.  Ra-cha-cha-cha.  Yeah, yeah.  Ra-cha-cha.  Can you try that real quick?  Ra-cha-cha-cha-cha.  Exactly.  But loud.  So loud that your voice actually hurts.  It was perfect.  It was perfect.  It was going to be done loud.  All right.  Tomorrow, 6-15, Bobo's one-man band.  Definitely.  So you got to, like, really work it tomorrow there, Bobo.  Yeah.  All right.  Should I do the same song?  You could do the same song.  We don't know what song you played. 
[01:10:00]  It was just fucking noise to us.  But add some more shit.  Maybe break some glasses on the kitchen floor.  That's true.  A Greek wedding.  Yeah, do a little Greek wedding action.  Yeah, tribute in honor of Vic Tabak's birthday.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Got it.  So you failed today, but we'll give you one more shot tomorrow.  All right.  Happy 420, Anthony.  Oh, well.  Imagine the happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you. 
[01:10:30]  Happy birthday, dear Hitler.  I'll finish it.  Happy birthday to you.  And then you go, how old are you now?  And he says, I'm 122.  And I shot myself in the head in the bunker.  And you go, oh, you silly goose.  Have some cake.  He, uh, all wacky things happen on this day, right? 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  A bunch of wacky things.  People get a little crazy.  Yeah, this is a day to just stay home.  With the 420.  Because it's a pot to charge, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It was a year ago today that that oil rig blew up there in the Gulf.  Was it exactly a year ago?  Exactly a year already.  And what they were saying was, um, wow.  Everything's back to normal, right?  This is going to be fucked up for 20 years.  We're not going to be able to get any fish out of the Gulf.  And apparently everything's fine. 
[01:11:30]  Between the Gulf and Japan, my sushi eating is way the fuck down.  Ah, the Gulf is fine.  Fuck that.  I'm catching my own sushi out in the Hudson.  There you go.  Oh.  I caught a crab.  Hey, uh, Matt has a very good idea.  Bobo's still on the line.  Matt, you want to pump up the one-man band for tomorrow?  What do you got?  Yeah, yeah, Bobo needs to add an air horn to it.  Bobo, could you add an air horn?  Yeah, yeah, I think I could.  I think I could add an air horn.  Do you have an air horn? 
[01:12:00]  I think I might be able to get one.  And I think there's one that I've had all these years that was supposed to be used.  It's a bit old.  I've had this.  At Mets games to celebrate, but there's never been a reason to celebrate.  Wait, do you have it now?  I don't have it now.  I could be able to get to it, but I can get to it a bit later.  This was saved.  All right, all right, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo.  You're panicking.  You're panicking.  Listen to me.  We all know you're really stupid, but you're not stupid enough to tell your mom that you're  going to be doing this tomorrow, right? 
[01:12:30]  Believe me, I'm not that stupid.  All right.  All right, so tomorrow's the big day.  Bobo's one-man band with an air horn.  Thanks to Matt in Ohio for pumping this up.  All right, believe me.  Believe you me.  Cha-cha-cha-cha.  Cha-cha-cha-cha.  Did you like that in that Michael J. Fox movie when he was doing that?  Wasn't that embarrassing?  Of course.  With Kurt Douglas.  We were just trying to make him, and he's dancing, and ra-cha-cha-cha. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, God.  Humiliating, right?  That's terribly humiliating.  He put the hat on and do the dance.  Oh, I'm getting goosebumps.  You want Bobo to try it again?  Bobo, one more ra-cha-cha.  Ha-cha-cha-cha.  Ra-cha-cha-cha-cha.  I fucking hate it.  All right.  All right, you really got to fucking practice all day today.  In silence, of course.  In silence.  In your room.  Jimmy Durante stunk.  Use your mind.  I'll be ready with that air horn.  All right, you better be ready 6.15 tomorrow, all right? 
[01:13:30]  All right.  All right, that's all we got today for Bobo.  Bobo is a one-man band tomorrow morning, 6.15.  Hey, can you find that Michael J. Fox, Kirk Douglas clip?  Ew.  I don't know why.  It's Kirk Douglas is like a rich guy, and everybody's being mean to him,  or they think he's going to die.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And Michael J. Fox is his nephew or something, and he's trying to entertain him,  and he's doing the fucking Jimmy Durante dance on the stairs.  Oh, it was so fucking bad.  Embarrassing.  It was embarrassing. 
[01:14:00]  Cha-cha-cha-cha.  He has the hat.  Ugh, the hat.  I fucking hate it.  Ha-cha-cha-cha-cha.  What is that?  Why did Jimmy Durante do that?  Who fucking liked that?  People in vaudeville, they enjoyed it.  I didn't.  That shit.  That shite.  That shite.  Do we have it now?  He's looking.  That story that bothered you there, Jimmy.  Well, it actually made you laugh.  Here it is.  Here's the heading. 
[01:14:30]  Now, let me just start reading it.  A homeless man stabbed a woman in the face with a pen on the number three train Tuesday  after she berated him for trying to smoke in the subway.  Oh, yeah.  The cop said, whatever his name is, our Cabaretto Cordero, he was trying to light a cigarette  on the crowded downtown train during the morning rush when Evelyn Seeger told him to stop. 
[01:15:00]  Witnesses say the argument quickly escalated with Cordero waving a big lighter with a high  flame in her face and the woman yelling.  He suddenly pulled out a pen and slashed her face from temple to nose in front of horrified  writers.  Seeger told Cordero to stop and then tried to knock the lighter from his hand.  Two men grabbed Cordero and while they were trying to restrain him, he slashed Seeger with 
[01:15:30]  the pen.  Now, obviously, this guy is a fucking maniac.  Here's this fucking Evelyn Seeger.  You dummy.  Anyone lighting up a cigarette on a crowded train in this day and age is fucking nuts.  It's crazy.  Know when to shut your fucking...  And I'm not saying she had it coming, but what are you doing to think that you're going  to talk to some fucking crazy guy who lives outdoors, who's crazy enough to smoke on a 
[01:16:00]  crowded train?  What fucking light do you think you have around you?  You know what I mean?  And I know, yeah, you should say something, but where is your fucking self-preservation  common sense?  Sometimes you shouldn't say shit.  Don't say nothing.  Or at least if you're going to say something...  Don't move to another fucking subway car.  Don't say a word.  They're nuts.  Are you going to say...  If you're going to say...  She was probably like, what are you really going to smoke?  You know, there's no smoking allowed in the subway.  Yeah?  She didn't know when to fucking shut her... 
[01:16:30]  Because if the argument escalated, she should have walked away.  She's Evelyn Seeger.  He's a homeless guy.  Evelyn Seeger.  Evelyn Seeger.  I'm Evelyn Seeger, for God's sake.  And then bomb.  Yeah, she just had that fucking air of protection.  Greedy.  Yeah.  The movie was greedy?  Oh, yeah.  Why do people think...  Not the best quality?  This is the scene that...  Oh, look, Ant.  Oh. 
[01:17:00]  You're an ambulance, Joe.  Oh, no.  Press the hat on.  Hello, folks.  This is Jimmy the Reddy.  Ha-cha-cha-cha-cha.  I didn't get you.  I didn't get you.  I didn't get you.  I want a tune for crooning.  Danny, somebody.  I didn't get you.  I can't watch this.  Why?  Ew.  You've got the whole wild spoon. 
[01:17:30]  Danny, stop the music.  Stop the music.  Everybody wants to get into the air.  Remember, Joe, you've got a thought of...  Oh, this is terrible.  Even when things go...  Fucking horrendous scene that is.  That is so embarrassing.  Are you embarrassed?  Oh, that is so embarrassing.  I couldn't look at it.  I didn't get ink.  I didn't get it.  I didn't get it.  Shut up.  Just spill the juice. 
[01:18:00]  Everyone wants to get into the act.  Yeah.  A-boo.  Fucking awful.  A-boo.  All right.  You know what we should do?  Because we're going to need some time for your thing, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So we'll do another thing here.  Then we're going to do your thing after the thing they do.  I got a verse mail.  Yeah, it's going to be great.  I got some text.  We got an update on Ant's...  Are you calling it a stalker? 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, it's beyond that.  I don't even know what it is.  It's a sociopath.  It's some kind of...  Well, I don't want to throw words around.  Oh.  I'm just saying it's somebody that should stop fucking calling and texting me constantly.  That's what I call it.  Okay.  That's fair enough.  Enough.  But first, Bill Donahue did the right thing with the Lady Gaga controversy.  We just talked about this yesterday.  Yeah.  And the big thing with this Lady Gaga is she keeps going after the easy religion, which 
[01:19:00]  seems to be the Catholics.  Lady Gaga.  Corny rebellion.  Yeah.  The corny rebellion.  Her new song is called Judas, and she's getting a lot of attention for it.  And we said on our show yesterday, certainly, if you want to be edgy and controversial, go  after the Muslims.  Go after Muhammad.  Yeah, I'm not saying Catholics are perfect, but they're not throwing fucking...  At least go after both.  You don't just go after Catholicism.  Yeah, we know they're terrible, but they're not throwing rocks at women in the Middle East.  Or go after the jih. 
[01:19:30]  They don't go after the jih either.  No.  But it's always the Catholics.  So I see it Bill Donahue's way, certainly.  Here's Bill talking about Lady Gaga.  Bill Donahue is joining me now.  He's the president of the Catholic League.  Jesus is my virtue, and Judas is the demon that I cling to.  Should we be upset about this, Bill?  You know, standing by itself, I mean, who really cares?  But what I'd look at is, do we have a pattern here?  This is a girl who gets dressed up as a nun to get raped, who swallows the rosary, who's  been dissing Catholics on and off. 
[01:20:00]  She's another one of these ex-Catholic girls who has a problem with their old religion.  And for some reason, they have to use Holy Week, don't they?  We've been tracking this kind of stuff in the Catholic League for a number of years.  A lot of people want to send a message to Catholics, you know, like their middle finger  message.  They use Holy Week.  And I'm a little fed up with it.  You know, if she has a problem with religion, go pick on the Muslims and see how they handle it.  Whoa.  But he's, he's, he's right on that.  It's true, though.  He makes that point.  It's like, there's never, to me, they don't, if they were attacking both, like, you know,  I would have no issue with it.  It's just corny to think you're being a rebel. 
[01:20:30]  You're not performing in 1950.  It's not Sullivan you're doing.  Stop thinking you're edgy.  Oh, he'll have the Jack Parr show tomorrow.  Lady God, no.  And then Bill, uh, continues.  Hello, Bill.  I mean, you raise an interesting point.  I mean, can you imagine if she did something like this, denigrating, uh, the Muslim religion?  You can't even show a depiction of Muhammad on TV and the newspapers and whatnot.  And I'm not out there to say, let's have equality by dump on the Muslims. 
[01:21:00]  I'm simply saying, why does it take fear as a motivational ethic on the part of some people to respect Muslim rights?  Do they want Catholics to pick up a machete in order for them to get their rights?  I don't think so, nor do I want it.  And I'm not saying that she's gone that far.  On a scale of 1 to 10, this is hardly the worst thing that I have seen.  But I don't like the timing.  I don't like the pedigree.  I don't like the...  You think ours was a 10?  That's all I'm thinking right now.  A 10.  Definitely a 10.  You think we made the 10? 
[01:21:30]  Oh, yeah.  On his scale.  He's making a sensible argument, though.  I don't like the copycatting of Madonna.  And if she's that talented, then she doesn't need to go there, does she?  Yeah.  You know, maybe she has something to work out.  She told Larry King here about a year ago, he said to her, what, you have a problem with Catholicism?  She says, no.  She says, I'm just confused about religion.  Clearly from those lyrics, she's very confused.  I would say she is very confused about religion.  You know what, Lady Gaga?  Got it, miss.  Guess what?  You hang out with Bill Donahue or buy your beer, honey, and maybe we can straighten you out finally.  Let's get them together, Lady Gaga and Bill Donahue. 
[01:22:00]  I love that he's just a drunk.  He really is a fucking liquor up.  He likes having a few drinks.  I don't know if he's a drunk drunk, but he certainly knows.  Oh, he's a drunk.  He certainly knows how to knock him down.  Dude, every problem with him is I'll buy you a beer.  He doesn't know what it is.  Even the Jews, we're going to crucify Christ.  Come on, I'll buy you guys a beer.  We go out, we grab a beer.  It's just Lady Gaga's doing the whole Madonna thing, right?  You would think she would take what Madonna did and then take it to the next level.  Yeah.  That's what you do as an artist.  Go after, be the one that goes after Muhammad.  Yeah, try that one. 
[01:22:30]  Or the Jew.  And then she won't be able to go anywhere in the world, on any world tours, because she'll  be afraid her head will be chopped off, which it probably would be.  Or somebody will run in with a fucking suicide bomb and somebody will.  So she's sort of brave.  None of them are brave.  They're fucking cowards.  Sort of.  She's sort of almost brave.  Yeah.  Kind of.  None of them.  The only fucking, the only ones that make fun of Muslims, at least, are fucking stand-ups.  I know I'm a comic, so I'm kind of whoring stand-ups.  But fucking, and again, I'm sure some musicians will say that they have. 
[01:23:00]  But look at what, again, South Park does, man.  They fucking brutalize everybody.  They kill Catholics, but they kill Muslims, too.  Right.  They go after everyone.  Remember about the dead guy?  Yes.  We got an update.  Oh, you did?  Well, I'd rather leave it with what I said before the break and just keep everyone wondering.  Oh, I'm curious now.  That he was dead or not?  Yeah.  Throw by a guy who looked like, to me, dead. 
[01:23:30]  Performance art.  Off the sidewalk, in the gutter.  Cops were just pulling up as we were driving by, and Kenny goes, it happens, when I said that  guy looks dead.  And Kenny decided it wasn't important enough to stop or look or do anything.  Update?  Yeah, we got an update.  It's Pete.  Pete!  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Good morning.  Pete.  So you did some research for us?  Yeah, I made up a couple phone calls to people.  I wasn't working last night, but I reached out.  And for what it sounds like, man, it's probably a drunk.  You know, give him the time. 
[01:24:00]  It was not a cardiac arrest.  And when it comes to Kenny, man, no good deed goes unpunished.  That's why he didn't stop, man.  It's an old tale.  You just don't stop when you not have to.  That's true.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, you know, it's a little downplay to the story.  It wasn't an arrest.  You know, he wasn't dead.  I know.  I didn't have to go to you.  I could have made everyone wonder all day.  Kenny, how do you know the guy was just drunk?  You got some info?  Don't know if he was drunk, per se, but I know he was not in cardiac arrest.  So it came over as an unconscious.  And then when they got there, you know, they didn't put a notification in for a cardiac arrest. 
[01:24:30]  Other than that, I don't want to give too much information.  I'll get some people in trouble, you know?  Well, is the guy walking now?  I don't know about that.  He's in a hospital.  All right.  So he still might be dead guy.  Well, he wasn't dead guy on the street.  He wasn't dead on the street yet.  You're still pulling for it.  I'm going for dead guy.  He'll die someday.  Kenny?  No, this guy is very smart because he knows, like, when I was a young, zealous police officer,  once in a while I would get the urge to do police work, and then I would just pull over 
[01:25:00]  until it went away.  Excellent.  That's the way you got to do things.  Yeah, it's a thankless job.  And what did you say to me in the hallway if we stopped?  Yeah, they want to know why these nosy nanties are being Budinsky's.  Budinsky's.  We're part of the problem.  Yeah, yeah.  Now we're the number one suspects.  All of a sudden, I'm a perp.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:25:30]  True.  If there was some suit stolen from the awful suit store, you're certainly our number one  suspect.  Cops always got to buy cheap suits because, you know, you wear them every day to get ruined.  Well, that's true.  You know.  Get some blood on them.  You got to be able to just dispose of them pretty easily.  I had a partner that used to buy all his suits at garage sales.  And he has nothing to do with the job.  He actually means his living situation.  And, like, he didn't even care if they fit. 
[01:26:00]  Like, if the waist was too big, he would just cinch it up with a belt.  And he wouldn't even dry clean them.  He would just, like, spray them with Febreze and just wear them.  Why?  I didn't care.  I don't know.  He was just cheap and, you know.  Well, good for him.  Yeah.  All right, Kenny, we didn't see a dead guy this morning.  Yeah.  Okay.  See, now we have better karma.  All right.  You were right.  Yeah.  Take care.  All right, man.  Thank you, Pete, for the info.  All right.  All right.  Wow.  Yeah.  What color is that suit? 
[01:26:30]  It's got stripes.  It's, like, tannish.  It's, like, a tan gray.  Green gray.  Yeah, it's fucking horrible.  It's the color of black.  Yeah.  I'd like a hepatitis and double XL, please.  Right.  It's just, it looks like bile or something.  It's terrible.  The color of bile.  The size of it is, like, a zoot suit.  It's giant.  It is giant.  Like, you can dance around inside that thing.  I know.  You could take a nap with his fucking suit jacket.  Giant.  He'd be nice and warm. 
[01:27:00]  Just giant.  Is he a giant, though?  No.  He's just a lummux.  What is he?  What is Kenny?  6'6"?  No, 6'4".  6'4"?  That's up there.  I think it's big.  So, so, dry.  All right.  We're going to get into the situation after the break.  Oh, yeah.  Situation.  A girl he may have had a little fun with.  It was supposed to be a little fling.  Oh, yeah.  Over a year ago, and it's just won't end.  And for some reason, she refuses to realize or let it go that it was just a dumb fling. 
[01:27:30]  And there's this delusion that she thinks that it's me that is reaching out and making this contact on a daily text basis.  And no, there's 20 of them from her.  Are we, you said you got new text messages and a voicemail.  Are we playing the voicemail today?  Oh, yes, yes, yes.  We will be playing the voicemail.  I love this.  Yes.  And the voicemail is so fucking just.  Good?  It's classic, yeah.  All right, good. 
[01:28:00]  Stay there.  Whoa!  What was that?  I have no idea.  I touched nothing, and this thing just went crazy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  It wasn't a nagel?  No, not me.  No nageling?  You sure?  I got my finger on the button.  I would gladly admit it.  For nagels?  You sure?  I mean, the people want to hear the nagel thing, though.  Well, go ahead, but this was not me this time. 
[01:28:30]  All right, fair enough.  It wasn't him, but just in case it was, we do this.  Out of nowhere, a nagel appears.  The show swerves to avoid it, but there's no hope.  The nagel is just too big and has made too many mistakes.  The host scrambled to get a hold of the situation.  Yeah, we certainly did.  The situation.  Poor Eric.  He just sits in there.  No, you missed it.  What'd he do?  We officially said, you know, he had nothing to do with it, but just in case he had something 
[01:29:00]  to do with it, then we played that.  He's not going to like it if his last name was used like that, will he?  Boom, boom, boom.  Ba-bam, ba-bam, ba-bam, ba-bam.  Anthony, so what's the big setup here?  We got a girl that you might have had a little fling with about a year ago.  Of course.  Was it at a O&A event?  Or?  Uh, yeah, it was some, one of those fucking softball game things.  One of those get-togethers?  Yeah.  And then you decided to do a what-the-hell? 
[01:29:30]  No big deal.  It's called a what-the-hell.  And it's like, yeah, whatever.  And both sides played the what-the-hell game.  Yeah, yeah, whatever it was, whatever it is.  And in a lot of cases, both sides understand it was a what-the-hell situation.  Every once in a while, you get one party that goes, what the fuck?  I thought this was more than a what-the-hell.  WTF, that's what I say.  And that's, I guess, what is going on here.  You had a what-the-hell, let's have a little fun, and that's it.  She thought it was going to be, you know, way more than it was, that she would be the future Mrs. Kumia. 
[01:30:00]  Look, I have no idea what the fuck she was thinking.  But a year later, I'm still getting texts and fucking emails and fucking voicemails.  A year later?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you would think, like, even if a chick is pissed or something, it would maybe go a couple weeks, and then they just get off it and say, fuck it.  And I already know the answer to this, but just for the radio audience, you did not lead her on or lead her down this path whatsoever. 
[01:30:30]  No, no, how do you lead someone down a path that goes on for a fucking year?  Right.  Like this.  So what is her goal?  When the only response that I've ever given has been, stop texting me.  What's her goal?  Because these people have goals.  I have no, I have no fucking idea.  Is her goal that you'll see it her way eventually?  You can only speculate, but I have no idea.  You really have no idea?  I have no fucking idea.  I know you have an idea, but I think you're trying to play it safe.  No, I honestly have no idea. 
[01:31:00]  Well, you know.  Can I say what I think it is?  Let me see.  Yeah, sure.  It's because of this.  Oh, well.  You can't call people that.  I know.  That's why.  Yeah.  I don't know.  You're going to know.  All right.  Give us the update.  Yeah, the update is I got more texts, more texts.  Now, the last time we did this, a mere few days ago, she was texting an imaginary person 
[01:31:30]  and sending it to you by accident.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, like just kind of showing you that she has a great life without you or something.  Right, right.  This is maybe trying to make you jealous of her, her great life.  I was getting what you might be missing.  I was getting a fuckload of texts from her.  Please have her text me.  And then.  Oh, please.  I will fucking.  You'll be annoyed in fucking six months.  Yeah.  Not even.  She's originally texting me and just give me the same fucking shit. 
[01:32:00]  I'll move on with my life.  I do this.  I'm doing this.  I'm doing that.  I'm doing that.  And I don't care.  I'll just be like, I don't care.  Stop texting me.  And then when I guess that wasn't really working, this new tech is to say that her phone is broken.  Right.  And I am somehow getting all of her texts that she sends to anybody.  But all of her texts are these long, drawn out texts like I used to get.  But they're to other people. 
[01:32:30]  You get it?  And they're about her life and how great things are and how many friends she has and things  like that.  And I'm just like, stop.  And again, I write, stop texting me.  She's like, God, just be patient.  My phone's broken.  Meanwhile, none of these texts are just like, you know, when you send texts to people and  they're like, hey, I'll see you at noon.  Or, oh, cool.  Okay.  That sounds good.  Everyone is this long thing that has things about, you know, things are going pretty 
[01:33:00]  well with me.  I'm doing this and that.  And everyone is this thing where it's like, obviously, she wants me to read this.  It's creepy.  Yeah.  And no one's phone is broken when they send text messages to people.  Can't you imagine the horror if your phone was broken and every text you sent went to  somebody else?  That's crazy.  Forget that.  That would be a fun app.  Throw that phone away in a second.  In a fucking second.  So, again, I guess yesterday I had read one and said, stop texting me. 
[01:33:30]  Yesterday, she writes, really got to talk to some cool people.  Remember?  Because I put her number out there on Twitter.  Right.  And said, hey, people, you know.  You have fun with this.  She wants some friends.  Go ahead.  That backfired for some of the listeners.  Because didn't some listeners say that they're not being harassed?  That she won't stop texting them.  Yeah, yeah.  Because this girl's a text machine.  Oh, my God.  She's a text machine. 
[01:34:00]  All right.  And let's see what we got here.  Got to talk to some cool people.  I've talked to people.  They're trashing you and then some.  And she goes, it's all the gay ass drama and bullshit.  It's sad that you do shit like that.  You turn your own fans and pests against you.  And then I just again wrote, stop texting me.  And that was the end of my communication with her.  Well, let's see. 
[01:34:30]  Yesterday, it starts up again.  Just letting you know, that's all.  Have a good night.  But didn't she already tell you, have a nice life?  You won't be hearing from me anymore?  Yes.  How long did I last?  I've seen that text and heard that voicemail a thousand times.  For the last one.  How long did it last?  Almost a day?  Not even.  Let me think.  Let's see where this text comes in.  This is April 17th at 6.44 p.m., right?  And then I text, stop texting me. 
[01:35:00]  And then at April 17th at 7.04, I get just letting you know, have a good night.  And then literally, she meant to have a good night, I guess, because the next text comes  at 5.59 a.m., April 18th.  And then it says, it just says, I don't.  It's just sad.  That's all.  Thank you.  It's appreciated.  Hope you have a great day.  Again, I guess that's supposed to be for someone else that happens to be up at 6 a.m., 
[01:35:30]  you know, for another radio show, I guess.  I guess it's another shock jock.  I guess.  Somewhere.  And then at 5.07 a.m. on April 19th, I guess that was all for the 18th, it just says, nah,  don't waste my time and it doesn't bother me.  She called me crying.  She's a bitch and a douche.  Why no one likes her and told her that. 
[01:36:00]  Her grammar is fucking deplorable.  I tried to be her friend.  She wants to act like that.  That's fine.  She's burning bridges with everyone by fucking everyone over.  I dropped her as well.  So she will end up alone because of it.  She soon will find out.  I don't know what that means.  April 19th, 1044 a.m.  Now, this is right when I got home, I guess.  Yesterday.  Yeah.  I'm glad you enjoy fucking over good people. 
[01:36:30]  Goodbye.  That was meant for you.  Yeah.  Okay.  Finally.  Finally.  Goodbye.  Finally a goodbye.  Congratulations.  It's over.  It's over, right?  10, 20, whatever.  It's over, right?  Just in the morning.  Great.  Well, then at 5.38 p.m. that afternoon, I just get a bubble with no words in it.  So it's like a blank kind of a text.  Uh, then let me make sure I have this chronologically correct because the, this, yeah, now the voicemail comes in. 
[01:37:00]  So let me play the voicemail for you.  This is, uh, this is another, another classic.  Can we do that on the Apple TV?  Not voicemail.  Not voicemail.  But the speaker does okay on, uh, on, uh, voicemail.  I'll pull away for a second.  When, when did this, uh, come in?  This came in yesterday at 5.41 p.m. 
[01:37:30]  Now remember that because you would think after this, it's done again.  Okay.  Yet there's more text after this.  Okay.  Okay.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Here we go.  Oh my God.  Anthony, you are a fucking riot.  So the fans have been telling me, actually a few of them have been telling me.  Exactly what was said and what was done in the air.  And you crack me the fuck up.  You seriously do? 
[01:38:00]  Because the whole obsession for, like, it's a matter of, like, a month or two.  Dude, I already have a boyfriend.  I've had a boyfriend for a couple months now.  You really need to get a life.  Imagine if, like, Lydia actually knew, like, everything that had happened and all of your bullshit.  It really, it just cracks me up.  Dude, just let it go.  I already have.  Like, move on with your life.  I already have.  So, and I'm happy. 
[01:38:30]  And I actually have a guy that actually treats me good and doesn't lie to me and treat me like shit and do all that crap.  So, good luck to you.  And I do.  I wish you all the best in the world.  So, have fun.  And seriously.  And I do honestly mean that.  Good luck to you.  All right.  It's over.  540 yesterday.  That's it.  It ends.  That was it.  540 yesterday.  April 19th.  It ended.  Good.  That was it.  Right?  Right? 
[01:39:00]  Isn't that good?  Yes, finally.  It's like, oh, I'm hilarious.  It's great.  Well.  Oh, God.  Yuck.  We do like Apple TV.  Oh, Jesus.  Yuck.  Seahorses.  Seahorses see people.  I love Apple TV.  Oh, God. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  But Jimmy doesn't like Apple TV.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  All right.  Seashells.  Seahorses.  All right.  That was at.  Yeah, that was at 540.  P.  All right.  So, it's done, right?  You need to move on.  Because she's got a boyfriend that treats her right.  I'm obsessed.  I need to move on.  Enough with it.  Like, I've, she actually sent that voicemail and made it sound like I was the one.  Oh, God. 
[01:40:00]  I was the one that has been, that had been texting her every fucking minute.  Oh, God.  Oh, man.  That was a, that was a night of a lot of Captain Morgan.  That's all I can say.  Oh, God.  Wow.  I have to.  I have to.  Forever.  Seahorses.  Right back, Jimmy. 
[01:40:30]  Here you go.  It was, here it is.  Yes.  It's April 19th, 633.  Now, this is about an hour, not even an hour after that voicemail.  Okay.  It was just about a minute of her talking about me.  I don't know what that means.  I do have a sense of humor about it.  That shit is in the past.  You're self-absorbed, aunt.  You and I know the truth about it all.  Again, glad you enjoy fucking over a good person. 
[01:41:00]  I know you don't and didn't care about me.  Good to know you regret me.  But I told you from the beginning that I had a lot of shit going on in my life.  As for my BF, boyfriend, well, whether I decide he's the best for me or not, as if it turns out to be serious, who knows?  I'm glad you got everything you wanted in life by fucking over people.  Really, did I?  And real true love, being in love, takes time to happen. 
[01:41:30]  People confuse love with lust.  I know you trusted me.  All that is in the past.  I'd rather not live in the past.  Why would you text me again?  I said don't text me, right?  The voicemail sounded like a finishing thing.  She said goodbye in the other one.  It's over.  How many times did you feel like it might be over with a text message or a voicemail? 
[01:42:00]  500.  500 times.  It was over 500 times.  Come on.  That's fun for the radio.  I'm not even kidding you.  It's been over 500 times.  Where you thought, okay, this will definitely be the last text.  How many text messages would you guess in a year?  About.  A thousand something.  I can't even, I can't even.  Easily a thousand.  Yeah, yeah.  Has to be.  Has to be. 
[01:42:30]  How many voicemails?  Have to be.  Voicemails.  I, I.  At the beginning, especially, they were coming in at a rate of.  Five to ten a day.  Holy shit.  Five to ten a day.  Holy shit.  Yeah, yeah.  I think if I print it out, it'd probably be 50 pages.  Probably be 50 pages of text.  And then, and then at 9.12 p.m. last night, I just get this. 
[01:43:00]  I'm really sorry.  What are the doctors saying?  Is he going to be okay?  What is that?  Another one of these.  Is that from the imaginary person?  Another one of these.  Ah.  Ah.  Ugh.  Yeah.  So that, um, that's where we are today. 
[01:43:30]  With, uh, with this, um, girl.  She keeps texting.  She keeps fucking, uh, uh, uh, uh, voicemailing.  And, and, and it, like I said, it's been over so many times.  But, it's never over.  A year!  Is it really a year?  Yeah.  Or under?  Year.  About a year.  About a year.  About a year.  We're going over a year.  It's, it's a year. 
[01:44:00]  Okay.  And, and, and it just won't stop.  Just won't stop.  The texts keep coming in.  How do you stop something like this?  I don't know.  People say, oh, you could block this.  You could, you could block, you could pop an app that blocks it.  No!  Ugh.  And you've tried everything, right?  I, I have tried everything.  Yeah. 
[01:44:30]  It's enraging.  Yeah, it is.  Yeah, this guy, uh, is absolutely correct from Connecticut.  Stink throttle says it all, Ant.  And it will never be over until you move on.  I figured out what the problem is.  I figured out what the problem is.  You see, seahorses meet for life.  Seahorses.  They don't take other problems.  Seahorses. 
[01:45:00]  Seahorses.  let's see  yeah a lot of people say why don't you change your fucking phone number no one wants to change  their fucking phone number no one wants to do that toby no one wants to do that  i don't want to change my fucking phone number that's a good question are some of the listeners

[02:01:00]  pfg tv up on there oh yeah yeah yeah where's scorch uh we of course scorch we worked with him way back  when up in boston and uh he's since gone on to do his own um tv show well he's a it's a paid  channel and he pays for an infomercial he's a media mogul sir oh really he's a media mogul  i'm actually i missed that i think he's on a different channel now that's less people  he's not on the my channel anymore that he was on my network in new hamster 
[02:01:30]  he's not on my network anymore no but that was his like he had how many networks  well how many affiliates that's the problem like now he's saying he's on a major like before he's  getting caught up in his lies because he has to lie about the new network  let's bring everyone up to speed though so he does a local show in new hampshire a little  morning show and now he decided he needs to be on tv as well so he what got a uh public access show  public access he started with a public access show yeah but what happened when he was in a bar  yeah didn't he start the show from the bar that was the public access show right in the bar right 
[02:02:00]  that was the tv show in a bar yeah in a bar and then last we left the people with the pfg tv he was in  a really nice tv studio right he started moving up the ranks of tv studios and then up to my network  and then he kind of disappeared remember the last time we played a clip it was when he said  i got something for those two people in new york meaning you guys then he disappeared for a while  oh god what happened right now he came back except he's not in a tv studio anymore well what happened 
[02:02:30]  to the tv studio i don't know but now he's back he's in a bar but he's back all right wait he's  back in the bar yeah he's not on the mind tv network anymore no he's on what happened there is he on the  web now only he is definitely on the web and he appears to be on something called uh retro tv  retro what's retro tv i don't know but i looked up the website and they play like old tv shows  it seems like they take public access channels and they put old tv shows on them because they because 
[02:03:00]  no one's buying nobody's watching it yeah so is this a good move for him going back to the bar  no i wouldn't think so but but i bet he spins it in a way where it's the best thing ever he does have  his opinions on it yeah i mean he he he seems to prefer it there but i wouldn't think career-wise  it makes a lot of sense uh-huh all right can we roll uh this episode up on apple tv just so we  have a visual it doesn't have it doesn't have to match up with the audio uh let's it will though 
[02:03:30]  awful on both counts all right let's get into this uh scorch pfg tv jessica introduces what's coming  up tonight on pfg tv all right live from the pfg's television center at michael's pub in tingsboro  the television center wow yeah television center at michael's pub in pingsboro what are you doing  well wherever he goes he said what happened was it's like a restaurant pub yeah and there's a wall 
[02:04:00]  with a fireplace against it and normally there'd be tables lined up for people to eat there but  instead they cleared out like four tables you know what when you fucking have like a bar grill  a pub restaurant fucking television studio has never been a part no a bar pub is the is the fire  at least real behind oh my god the visual the fire does appear to be a real fire and when is he going  to get a laptop from this century he looks like a crazy evangelist you notice he's back to using like 
[02:04:30]  the little uh footstool for a table wait he's sitting at a footstool in front of a fire oh my god  what happened to the tv studio why the horrible couch what happened to the good couch and the  graphics all behind him right nick carpinelli the guy on the couch now appears to be the guy on the  wicker love seat yeah it's like that's outdoor patio furniture all right why is there a fire behind  him i don't know what is he doing he's dressed like fucking crazy eddie yeah crazy live from the pfg's 
[02:05:00]  television center at michael's pub in tingsboro it's scorch's pfg tv presented by the new england  subaru dealers i'm jessica and tonight joining scorch in the living room is nivia from loca photo  doing a sponsor spotlight we'll talk to pro wrestling historian and show regular sheldon goldberg  plus we'll do weird news the appetizer info on how you can be on the show and our special musical  guests on the auburn pit stage it's the brooklyn's now give it up here's scorch 
[02:05:30]  now you hear the applause yeah yeah yeah that's something i'm a little suspect of that's being piped in  scorch has this uh photographer that he had on the show he let the photographer take pictures he 
[02:06:00]  doesn't go to he learned from us i think when we pointed out that there were only a very few people  at his old bar shows yes he stopped doing audience shots however the photographer took a picture of  the audience and now through the magic of apple tv oh we'll get to it i share with you oh my god see  how come it sounded like wow they sound like there were hundreds of people yeah you could see scorch right  there in the corner by the fireplace yeah yeah i'm gonna count for everybody two four five six seven 
[02:06:30]  eight nine maybe ten people by the way the people sitting at the bar that's the band that's performing  later oh okay so there's literally six people there to see scorch yeah and he made it sound like there  are hundreds clear the applause again i gotta hear the applause again now that we know there are six  people there doesn't he have a following where they would show up for this no he doesn't no oh 
[02:07:00]  this is depressing he's in manch vegas i mean i want to do his show although he did announce i said that  i would road trip in a second to do this he did announce that if you uh tell people if you tell the  restaurant in advance that you're going to the pfg taping uh you give free appetizer  while you watch the show oh boy what kind of appetizers i mean probably you know definitely  mozzarella sticks something like that what about some of that calamar well i mean i don't know this 
[02:07:30]  is you know this is new ham this is manch vegas after all and what happens in uh manch vegas stays in  manch vegas exactly right especially broadcasting yeah it should would you do you would do pfg tv  in a second because he does have comedians on from time to time in a second i would do a road trip  just to do this let's uh scorch talks about the pfg tv network and scorch and nick do a little two-man 
[02:08:00]  comedy a little two-man back and forth oh man welcome scorches pfg tv to all of the viewers in the  whole pfg tv network see we can't even say this station or this station anymore because we're i love  that he has no idea that this is not working he's not faking this in his mind he is as big as  fucking conan o'brien it's fucking happening and leto and the rest of them and he's like look this is  too big for me to even name the affiliates anymore living the dream they all said it wouldn't happen 
[02:08:30]  we're just nationwide uh this guy on late night tv show this guy wants to explain retro tv just so we  have uh the the full picture uh vinnie hello boys what's up basically when all of the tv channels  went digital they got extra channels they have the regular channel and then they got like an extra  channel because they could fit more stuff into the bandwidth and retro tv and a couple of other  companies offer shows literally just to fill that channel so the only way you can actually get retro tv 
[02:09:00]  is if you don't have a cable box and if you have a converter for the rabbit ears correct  there's a handful of uh there's a handful of cable companies that will carry like one or two of them  my local one carries retro tv for my local channel but yeah pretty much you have to not have cable  you can't get this for cable no you have to have like the converter box for the rabbit ears  right oh my the digital converter it gets worse for your rabbit ears so technically he's on more 
[02:09:30]  markets but the only way you can get it is if you don't have cable okay so that's it right there  our tv you'd have to disconnect your cable to receive the program and hook it up worse  like a lot of people would say most most most of the time you'd say i have to get cable in order to  get this but you'd actually have to take it away in order to get this show well it's worth it  it's it's pfgt can fios get it no no no no you're all mixed up you'd have to you'd have to have the 
[02:10:00]  files guy come in and actually take out the files and then replace it with nothing and then you can  get it sorry i said there's a remote chance you might have one or i'm i'm looking at the uh the  affiliate list for retro tv yeah guys we're in luck there is an affiliate there's an affiliate for our  area really thank god it's wkob-dt oh i watched that anyway yeah it's rf channel 2 virtual virtual

[02:15:30]  well there's gonna be some questions asked okay balls in your court where's my tv some guys are  improv guys like they just prefer to kind of go out there and just kind of wing it and they you know  you tell them sam jesus that's where scorch and nick are just kind of an improv pair criminy i love your  loyalty to this guy that gave you your first break yeah the thing about scorch is everything i know  about radio i learned from that's right oh cool everything this is how you pay him back uh weird  news begins weird news a bad edit cuts off the laugh track you know this weird news yes i mean whoever's 
[02:16:00]  editing scorch's program by the way i believe that the uh applause and stuff yeah it's not done with  a sound machine in how it's done later yeah in post right um and so now in weird news i guess i had to  cut for time or maybe they were awkward because they were they just cut in between every joke and  so they added a laugh track and then cut it off so they could all right let's listen to this we have  a whole busy show today so why don't we get into things with our very first segment that we call 
[02:16:30]  weird news okay  newport beach california an off-duty police officer was arrested after he allegedly showed up to a massage  parlor wearing his badge and gun and loudly demanding a and i quote frontal massage  when the girls in the parlor what is he doing is he doing a letterman laugh there like i 
[02:17:00]  i just love jimmy's face actually i believe scorch started doing that on the air before before  letterman yes okay i should have known i mean him and dave borrow from each other you know they  kind of throw bits back and forth you can barely tell the difference between shows you know guys uh  pek 28 on twitter is right scorch is blowing up you guys are just jealous of his 155 twitter  followers that is you see his audience some of them showed up you're right you're right  studios yes is that his mom that showed up for the tape maybe she does live in the area 
[02:17:30]  girls in the parlor refused to give it to him uh he destroyed some furniture and then he stormed off  in his car uh his police car which is stupid move number two uh and how did he get caught a because  he was in his police car and remember i said he was wearing a uh his gun and his badge yes that's all he  had on this guy had his badge pinned to his chest and he had his gun around his leg let me tip illinois  no we didn't did you hear the crowd start laughing though it's fucking mind-bombing 
[02:18:00]  yes that's why we do this this is it's either the worst show i've ever heard or the greatest thing  ever brought to a television screen that no one can get no it's either the worst thing anyone's ever  done or whatever would be one level below that  did we hear that laughing weird news yeah let me hear the the his joke into the laugh yeah that 
[02:18:30]  song is great into the laugh wearing a uh his gun and his badge yes that's all he had on this guy  had his badge pinned to his chest and he had his gun around his leg let me tip illinois it's the  rupert pumpkin fucking laughing like when he's down in his basement the problem is that the pfg's tv  seems to be getting more and more into rupert pumpkin area yeah you think it started there and then  kind of no now with this those are canned laughs from like an old 50s sitcom but was he going for 
[02:19:00]  a joke marcus will be with the badge yes he was all he had was a badge i believe i believe he made  that up that was his humorous anecdote in the story he made that noise did you hear that like like the  laugh like to lead everybody exactly and you also have to realize that he is pausing after his jokes  because he knows he's going to add a laugh track later oh okay all right let's hear that just so  we can get i'm fascinated with the uh editing process wearing a uh his gun and his badge yes that's all 
[02:19:30]  he had on this guy had his badge pinned to his chest and he had his gun around his leg let me tip illinois  you're like an awesome girl screaming she's laughing so hard but they had to cut it quick to get to  the next story yeah yeah but they they all shut up real real fast any cancer kids this week not this  week no you mean a cancer kid that he uh said was a growth on his back yeah yeah real nice scorch the  greatest scorch line ever my name is rupert pumpkin oh god uh more weird news finally in middleton 
[02:20:00]  massachusetts a robber had an ironic end to a recent burglary this is a great story 23 year old eric  holman allegedly tried to rob the jc grill and convenience store eric if you're watching this  show he tried to leave the store this 55 year old guy with his wooden leg right oh my god and then  he held the guy down on the ground till the cops arrived uh it's funny thing the older the guy had 
[02:20:30]  a very good sense of humor about everything when the cops showed up they said what are you laughing  at it he said now this guy just like me doesn't have a leg to stand on so there you go and that  my friends is today's installment of weird news thank you very much  i i like how they they laughed midway through yeah they left the setup yeah the you are the  you are an idiot song well they were laughing at the you are an idiot song which is a scorch 
[02:21:00]  favorite you have any idea how often he played that song on the radio really a lot it's a staple  he loves a benchmark it's a benchmark it's a scorch benchmark the the way that the audience like  just started cracking up at right at the end of that song right not as it was playing and it was  also he knew in his head like i'm sure he wrote that he's going to add that in post because he  looked at the camera and it was ready immediately for the you are the you are an idiot right right and  boom the audience picks up good thing there's two tracks for sound effects  so now does he have the radio show oh yeah he's rocking afternoons in manchester 
[02:21:30]  what time is he doing three to seven what does he do well he does a brain cell stimulator  which again i can't take anything seriously that's another that's another benchmark which  he's been doing since the morning days in syracuse yeah morning days so um so he's been moving up in  the radio world well i mean yeah syracuse new hampshire weird news technically down 
[02:22:00]  and plus he went from mornings to afternoon like you guys what you guys are afternoons and then  mornings he did the reverse and went slightly lower in terms of markets steven s from bayshore makes  a very valid point on the instant feedback yes we still have the instant feedback uh hey  hope how can you mock scorch's show is the lead in for nanny and the professor  nanny and the professor 
[02:22:30]  oh steve's in a great mood today i don't know why but steve s from from bayshore just in a great  great mood today must be a special day you know what i mean he wrote that with a boner  oh of course he did he's got a boner all day yes yes uh scorch and nick interrupt the sponsor break  for a little more improv comedy two-man comedy i love the way they work off of each other because  you know the sponsor break is when scorch because at scorch doesn't take commercial breaks because his 
[02:23:00]  sponsors are like part of the family right so it's not a commercial break no and it's also because it's  paid programming so there wouldn't be any commercial breaks here why would there be it couldn't be here  comes the comedy in three two oh one i love it is what makes a subaru a subaru feel free to  i have an itch tonight is it a constant itch i have an itchy eyebrow what does that mean to dry skin  you need some kind of solve solve did you say soft i said solve i'm talking bloomers who asked me how old 
[02:23:30]  i am and you said solve all right i meant to say it isn't the word so i'm reducing cream isn't the  word sov okay whatever curve curve whatever solve hey granny you got some of that solve  oh that's right we're doing a sponsor break sorry sorry paying sponsors auburn pits let's hear  for auburn pits wow it's it's just this is something this is like watching a racer head 
[02:24:00]  it really is i can't quite wrap my mind if your racer was dick  i i can't get over the fact that he has no  fucking clue that none of this is working and what's great is what is the that's the brilliance  of this whole thing this thing has become more and more of a scam because he does less and less  stuff that's associated with actual show content and more and more that's just sponsored yeah 
[02:24:30]  wow should we take the mob wives yeah in 20 minutes yeah all right sure did  fucking two and a half million people last night i didn't watch the show though i didn't either but  is it sammy the bull's daughter yeah all i heard was uh people are very some staten islanders were  very insulted okay we'll figure something out we're not prepared to have the mob wives in but  we'll we'll take them and we'll be nice to them yeah the show's big so show them apple tv did big  numbers with vh1 from a load of shit yeah tell ron we'll do the mob wives we'll finish the show up 
[02:25:00]  with those uh those bruds but right now scorch pfg tv scorch interviews someone from uh loca photo yeah  yeah it's a it's a loco loco photo loco photo that's the who took this picture uh that we're  looking at on apple tv of uh his uh studio audience six person his studio slash pub audience right yeah  she's a a sponsor and i guess she paid enough to get an interview on the show and but the reason i 
[02:25:30]  pulled this is not because it's not an interesting clip but you have to listen closely because you can  hear the few people in the bar just milling about and talking well why aren't they uh paying attention  and ready to applaud so loudly like they have been with in the past and the visual that goes along with  this is scorched for some reason they left the full body shot of scorch on as opposed to switching to  a different camera angle and you can see his hand waving people saying stop stop talking stop talking  way are you kidding me you know what that's fantastic i went to a jimmy fallon taping once and 
[02:26:00]  then we were fortunate enough to be on the show and and jimmy does the same stuff does he yeah  people are talking to the audience and you see him like trying to hush the people down does he do  it in a pub with six people in it or is it when lauren michaels is getting him de niro  is it when jimmy's interviewing the fucking lady who takes the pictures all i'm saying it's not only  scorch this happens how much gorgeous the big night again scorch i'm an innovator how much did 
[02:26:30]  de niro have to pay for his sponsor break yes sponsor break what it's what scores do put it  looks we'll look at somebody with a clit and a polaroid camera good one yes let's talk about uh  let's talk about loca photo because as we said before i love what you do you are you you you've  taken photography and you've made just everything you touch uh seems to make like beautiful just  beautiful work what uh why photography how long like what brought you into the world oh my god he 
[02:27:00]  can't even fucking you can't what is he doing he's stumbling she's a photographer there's no one that  could really make photography better why photography it's just become its own thing at this point we all  have phones that just take great pictures now but he's not asking annie lebowitz a question about  shooting the queen without a fucking hat right jesus christ you stammering idiot some  fucking lady who's probably like dolores why the uh gray uh the uh you taking pictures of the work 
[02:27:30]  everything you touch you make beautiful why the uh if it's a picture i'm starstruck  so are we gonna see him wave off i can't believe i'm talking to you it's just amazing you know  there's like number one photography girl in manchester he talks like fucking rocky too when  he was doing the fucking read for the commercials right okay now what a big get for the show right 
[02:28:00]  hand okay look at penny marshall he's interviewing look at the microphone on my couch but it's not  because she uh it's just what can we hear that question again uh seems to make like beautiful just  beautiful work what uh why photography how long like what brought you into the world of photography  well um as i was a little girl i always enjoy going you know whenever i go to my aunt's house i would  always grab the album and it was such a thrill to go through the pictures and i really enjoy it holy 
[02:28:30]  shit did you hear the voices yeah yeah mondo topless girls i don't know i don't know what a horrible  question and and and and remarkably an even worse answer yeah i i'd like to go through my oh you're  starting away yeah hey keep me right put me down this is my uh the camera girl my great my answer photo  album i grabbed her album when this little girl my uncle would take the photos of me without any of 
[02:29:00]  my uh clothes on and took look at my aunt's photo album and we saw when everybody was fleeing the nazis  that's all you got on this i want to hear this whole interview now oh god all they're doing is  talking about photography think about pfg tv right there sure like on my kodak 110 with the flash bar 
[02:29:30]  we gotta do a nostalgia show someday uh what makes what what makes a good photographer  well um equipment does right well hold this and tell me equipment is this your regular point shoot  camera well no but i like it because i can see myself that's the audience well you have to have  yeah that's the real audience wow please do not develop any of those what is going on nick just 
[02:30:00]  said please do not develop any of those as if he was holding a film camera film camera first of all  secondly secondly he didn't even take pictures he was going with his mouth and the last one he did he  pointed toward his crotch where was the guffaws the laughter from the audience that was laughing  at everything earlier this was more of a subtle subtle humor type of deal can i say honestly  i that it could be the worst clip i've ever seen on television just that one little bit 
[02:30:30]  it was just devoid of anything could we please play that again i'm begging yeah yeah i gotta hear  that it was so i like it because i can see myself here's a good gives him the camera so he plays um  seven to eight years ago i started doing some photography for my husband he was in a band  and um i was just doing freebies at a time and i upgraded gears and i'm pretty uh geared up right 
[02:31:00]  now so nice good for you now here's a good question okay honestly what makes you know what  makes a photographer a photographer because honestly i couldn't even i couldn't take action  we got ripped off what makes a photographer a photographer you chipped us i'm a good question  a mechanic a mechanic well by the way you guys are prepared for the mob wives yeah maybe when they  come in so what makes a mob wife a mob wife a mob wife the fuck what makes a photo i don't know 
[02:31:30]  when you look at something and you see it that makes you have eyes yeah if you have a camera you're  a photographer she's not a good photographer she's stuck in manchester that's not where the good  photographers are hanging out she's so good that she's she's doing gigs for sports yeah right yeah  go back tiny little audience stop because a little is a lot okay yeah that's fine just kodak 110 with  the flash bar yeah we gotta do a nostalgia show someday uh what makes what what makes a good 
[02:32:00]  photographer well um equipment does right well hold this and tell me what do you think is this your  regular point shoot camera well no but i like it because i can see myself  well you have to have the  please do not develop any of those i'm surprised it's still in one piece  you know what i'm going to answer your question for me i think it's the eye i think it's the eye 
[02:32:30]  has everything to do with it the eye and the camera hasn't turned towards her at all a steady hand  now but you also have to know what is good subject matter right you have to know your your your thing  i mean i do my my work online i i keep myself uh in touch it's insightful and but i have to upgrade  gears every once in a while so we do it's like rbi right now we're on betting as long as i like i was  like yeah we just steady hand you don't want shaky pictures blurry the best is all you see is nick's 
[02:33:00]  fucking dumb hush puppy sticking in they refuse to put him in the shot no scorch probably requested  that nick not me but all they had to do is move the camera because there's there's too much room  uh to left the scorch that has nothing in frame no i i want to be uh it's a solo one-on-one  interview i'd rather not have uh nick in the shot i want the two shot all right well you can put  his shoulder in she's not riveting oh wow she looks like the bassist from the way out  he said what makes a photographer a photographer she said look it's a camera look 
[02:33:30]  and she handed him a camera yeah steady hand i would say so a finger so you can press the button  does that make it need a flash it's dark flash if it's dark out i know all the things about photography  tripod tripod for those shots where you need a tripod steady hand or tripod we got a few more clips  before the mob wives come in so uh we got scorch talking about how great his new venue is which is 
[02:34:00]  this crappy bar yeah you know you said that he always tends to look on the positive oh boy does  he he practically learn from scorch as far as looking at the positive i think scorch is one of those guys  who practices the secret and power positive thinking yeah and things like that and puts himself where  he wants he visualized himself in this pub oh yeah a bad if something bad happens he doesn't even see  it that way nothing bad turns it around it's good uh before we get into our next segment i want to  talk about we we tape the show now this is the living room we felt so genericized if you can use 
[02:34:30]  that word everything was so generic and sterile okay did i mean everything was so you know i mean  the tv studios were nice mind you i'm not going to say the tv studios weren't nice but you know what  we came into this place we tape at michael's pub it's on 113 in tingsborough massachusetts  it's 147 frostwood uh michael's pub actually set aside a special place just for us and this is  what we call it's 3a excuse me excuse me my bad my bad see it's a bar i'm allowed to drink when i 
[02:35:00]  tape the show now uh but what's on 113 then am i taping another show there no no no 113 please  no it's probably that bar you don't remember djing at oh okay michael's pub gave us this beautiful  living room and even in the middle of summer when the fire is going and i'm schmitzing like an sob uh  you know what it's still going to be a beautiful place they didn't give him a living room they just 
[02:35:30]  moved some tables it's not a living room he's facing the bar it's a bar there are probably normally just  tables there and and chairs let me put up the picture again and and like there's a bar six  feet from his face and they gave him this beautiful living room it's like that's the most there's no  living room there he's got a fireplace you can see they just pushed some tables aside yeah yeah boy he  sure knows how to spin uh squirt introduces a new segment yeah the app it ties the appetizer 
[02:36:00]  do do do do do do by the way most people would think oh maybe he's going to be talking about  different iphone apps right he just talks about his app oh in this segment what 500 000 where you  want to talk about a spin oh okay there's been a few more downloads since last night  and we couldn't find any we couldn't find any proof that anyone has actually ever downloaded yes well  there is proof that at least three anthony sam travis have downloaded three people have downloaded 
[02:36:30]  uh his app now you know what i want to do i want to do this segment that we call the app  the tizer because scorch's pfgdp we've made into the future we have a phone app now that as of this  taping of this show has been downloaded seven hundred forty one thousand two hundred thirty two times  what he's got the exact number go on over seven hundred thousand times but he's got the exact like 
[02:37:00]  to to the two to the number yeah not not to the ten not to the hundred to the single number he just  got the statistics before they went one more person downloaded it right before they went on air and he's  like we have to put a big come on make that a two it'll be accurate turn it into a do  now on the appetizer we've got a lot of cool things for instance we have this show you know  danny i have a question yeah i have a question your app should be accurate to your twitter at the 
[02:37:30]  very least it should be what do you mean you should be able to see some metrics yeah of course right  right the numbers don't lie how many followers does he have uh scorch and this is at scorch  well who's going to get more now so uh at scorch pfg briefly  good he's got about 155 followers all right about or exactly exactly so 155 followers on twitter  yet 700 000 plus well he's not a twitter guy he's a tv app guy that is true he's too busy 
[02:38:00]  taping these shows to be all right he's like an app guy we have the weekly show that we tape and you  see it uh it's on the appetizer now it's on the app itself i mean now if you if  you already have the app uh apparently everyone does re-download it and register  because now we have uh alerts and you could actually get alerts so we'll be telling you  certain things for instance we'll save for the next five people that come out to the tv tape 
[02:38:30]  they want to give you a free dinner at michael's pub in tingsborough something like that you know  i mean tingsborough yeah tingsborough yeah you get a free app at michael's pub in tingsborough  know what i mean he is amazing we have two more clips but we have mob wives what do we do do  mob wives then go back to the clips or you could just do the two clips then they'll come in and boom  what an hour and boom scorch uh talks about the app in the pub crawl the scam is made clear what  do you mean the scam is made clear well you know how the pub you know how scorch always has 
[02:39:00]  an ulterior motive yeah and the ulterior motive is usually to scam people out of some cash and not  give any to nick yeah i'm just assuming that's pretty safe you've seen it before yeah um well  he lets the cat out of the bag that the pub crawl is not a is not a charity thing now that it's  associated with the app uh also on the app now we've got the uh we've got a fun and games section  you know i mean where you can actually go on and play certain games like online beer pong nice which 
[02:39:30]  is nice you know i mean angry viewer yeah also we've got pfg radio now pfg radio this is the  kicker right here bands that get on the pub crawl you buy onto the pub crawl you support yourselves and  invest in yourselves you support us it's only 10 bucks a week you get on for at least two months  you get some tunes on pfg radio i'll tell you we're adding three bands by the time this show airs  there's going to be three more bands on pfg radio uh yeah literally that's that's picking up nice 
[02:40:00]  uh so and mind you you know not to like try to encourage you or try to like uh you know sway  you one way or the other but bands that get involved in this for pfg radio we work in radio and  television do you know how many industry type people are at pfg at the app checking out pfg radio so you  never know who could see and hear about your stuff you know i mean so but i have to add industry 
[02:40:30]  people he believes all this does he really yes he also yes he funny he just threw a few numbers out  there he said ten dollars a week you get on for two months but that means he charges them ten dollars  a week for two months for two months there's a minimum buy it's a eighty dollar it's eighty dollars  just to get on the pub crawl this guy loves trying to get money out of nickel and diamond  and then he tells people that they're investing in themselves because industry people have the pfg 
[02:41:00]  app and are listening to the industry put up a picture of all those industry people in that  okay you know how many industry people actually download the app i want to try to figure out which  uh person is the industry a few industry people went down to check out the taping we'll just throw  it up out at apple tv right now and there they are yeah oh yeah oh you know what they're right  there it's the two in the front because those are the older usually older people are in charge  so it's probably the gray-haired women sitting down in the front with a free appetizer we have  one more clip scorch brings on a wrestling historian and they promote their revolutionary new concept

[02:45:30]  my crime no wow i gotta say uh really busting apart those italian stereotypes yeah yeah like i  give a shit i'm italian too i'm amazed what does it matter to me i love that  to talk to you because it's amazing how can you guys how can they do a show like this now like  can you imagine doing a mob show called like you know mob like 25 years ago what happened  was it was it your dad you think flipping and being okay that just turned the whole tide of  people being silent why because everyone's cooperating now it's like the new thing he wasn't 
[02:46:00]  the first person he wasn't the first person so i don't i'm sorry yeah he's talking to me see how  she does right now but you should i'm actually just curious i don't you know no i think that it's  just i mean so many people have after him and this lifestyle has been put so much out there that  you know yes it's the the code has been broken so many times but the reason why we decided to do  this show is about the women we're not talking about the men we don't talk about well sometimes 
[02:46:30]  we don't talk about their lifestyle so right so what's the what is there what so what do you  girls talk about then uh as being mob girls uh what do you talk about mob wives yeah we basically  we're exposing ourselves to other people to let everyone in this world know that we're as normal as the  person we just deal with we just have been hit with time where you know the men do the crime but  we basically do the time that's the point and we wanted to show how even though it might not be 
[02:47:00]  normal normal no listen i'm sorry but if you go in every household somebody in a family a family  member has been probably sure so you know what what we don't it's also annoying to always uh like  watch things and like i know when i sit back and i watch something i'm like yeah what are you looking  at i'm thinking you know what the kids are doing right now do you spit on your own floors who spit on  they spit on their floors no oh come on you ever see good fellas i'm like this is over our head 
[02:47:30]  we're like what where you've been where you've been ever seen the good fellas  when you are when you watch movies mob movies uh do you look and go like that's  bullshit or that's that's pretty accurate but that's the point you don't see the women you don't  see the kids pain you see you don't see anything but the men but we saw a lot of marie  so a lot of marie and yeah and she's the makeup and all that and uh i think that um goodfellas 
[02:48:00]  actually really kind of touched on the female perspective yeah yeah i definitely think that it  it did and i guess what we're doing is really now that's a movie and we're giving you real life right  and you haven't seen the show but we could i can clearly say um in the preview my son's father  happens to get my ex-husband happens to get arrested during everything so  he gets pinched why are you toning it down now that's how we live you don't know what it's 
[02:48:30]  like you wake up you don't know what's happening right it's a thursday morning 5 a.m it's like  oh the phone goes off you know get bail like you automatically know you get a phone call you  better go put your house up you better call you got a call because you're we know what it is  was it something was it something bad um actually he was charged with uh tune in yeah apple do we get  to say apple on this that's why i was actually like yeah what was it something i was just like  was it something yeah well they don't know um they mentioned several different things but yeah yeah 
[02:49:00]  yeah and now what are you saying because i i was listening to the news and i heard a little bit  controversy uh some women from staten island a little upset about you girls uh get over it  are you fucking sick like why are you taking it so personal because we live there yeah we're not  like we're putting our stories out there we're not trying to destroy staten island and making a  stereotype listen people judge us anyway because of the lifestyle that we're associated with but we 
[02:49:30]  just feel like listen people are going to judge us regardless and we're just doing us we're just going  out there and we're not knocking women what these women need to realize we're saying women are  strong so the women that are mad that you're saying wow finally women are standing up for women  in a different aspect people are coming into our homes nobody else's homes they're coming into our  lives our homes so why is anybody else do you do you kind of look at it though and thinking people  looking at you going like you know what's going on why were you staying sticking around why would 
[02:50:00]  you always say yeah yeah so so why do like why do you knowing that lifestyle is is illegal and and  and what we're used to like on my case to leave my father because he went to jail what kind of woman  would my mother be no one's ever fell in love with uh uh you know listen for me well i'm saying is there  a moral issue there where you would have to say like you know i know what this life is i know what  this lifestyle is i don't want to be a part of it and if i do want to be a part of it then i have to 
[02:50:30]  live with all the bullshit that comes along with it can i talk can i say yeah karen go ahead for me  your father did you might as well see i don't have people to talk about my father so we're gonna have  to be you know kind of thread water on that subject but anyways so um i just feel like people um  definitely have to look at us for what we're doing like i see what that lifestyle is and i made my  mistakes myself like i did my own dirt so i'm moving past it if you don't learn from your 
[02:51:00]  mistakes and move forward were you scared i wanted to ask you when the whole thing happened  i mean i know family members are kind of off limits but were you afraid like when it was all on the  paper and everybody knew it was going on were you afraid like wow he's gonna be killed or like you  start thinking like this person i love is gonna be i think that comes with the territory regardless i  always thought about it listen when i was 10 years old you know i my people are passing away and  people are getting killed in that lifestyle you know what i mean i turn on the news and i see  my uncle's car blow up you know this is something that it comes with that world so i was always i 
[02:51:30]  was always you know conscious of that family members been killed over all that really yeah  it's hard to die in jail any day right let's just clarify one other thing you sign up for the army  there's no there's no proof you're coming home right so let's not just pick on that world because  there's people die every day in all different types of ways so it i'm not going to see but it's  the criminal element of it that makes people go like hey this is you know glorifying i'm not 
[02:52:00]  glorifying people would say that that you are and stuff i wouldn't i don't know you know what  tell them to stay tuned all 10 episodes and see if i'm but but that's a legit question though like  do you is it hard because we don't we don't live that life in that world so is it hard if you're  like you love somebody and you know they did a b and c are you kidding me it's the let me tell you  something the worst thing in the world i did was go to i was only married three weeks he got my  husband got pinched three weeks marriage eight years he gets i'm in court i'm hearing about  everything he did in his past that i don't know about he never told me you think they i don't 
[02:52:30]  the misconception is these people think they go home you lay down with your wife from bed and go listen  to this no you don't have no idea it's a different person in the home you close the door outside so you  hear about all this i really wanted to so now but but and and after only a short time of marriage  was there still a loyalty there with him yeah sure okay i was dating him before we got okay so so now  why was there any ever in your head like let me just get the fuck away from this uh yeah yeah yeah 
[02:53:00]  but now why didn't you she has children is loyalty to your kids and stuff like that i mean also that's a  very good point karen because my oldest daughter what i have to go through now is you try to explain  to any child especially a very intelligent one what her father did is not so bad sure it's bad how are  you going to choose your words correctly this kid will have it embedded in their head forever so i have  to sit there and talk about her father to her and be really careful kind of like i'm on a stand but 
[02:53:30]  she's gonna but at some point she's gonna be able to find out everything on the internet and  everything else that i found doing this show i sat back and sat back is the right thing to do for for  so long and i was like you know what she could google his name all she's gonna hear is what she's  gonna hear and you know the press doesn't always tell the truth let's not get crazy but at the same  time i can sit on this show and tell her who her father really is as a father as a husband she 
[02:54:00]  can maybe hear a good thing for once yeah i agree when is he getting out yeah well that's the big  question in the show it's a big question because it was a lot a lot later than i thought a lot later  than you thought is it hard to stay faithful like i mean is it hard when you wait for seven eight years  absolutely are you kidding me but you want to know something everybody has that question is it hard to  be that's a good question but at the same time like look you have what time do you have i know i always  had a job i was always working i had my girls i had not time to do anything so really when was i 
[02:54:30]  even going to have time but the beauty of being me i need two minute segments yeah has any has anyone  in the uh in the business leaned on you about uh doing this and said look you know enough enough  enough of this publicity you know enough publicity we don't we don't want you know because obviously  uh silence is kind of the thing we're talking about ourselves we're talking about the women  even so it's kind of making a connection so yeah but all of our men already you google them we're 
[02:55:00]  no surprise they're in books my husband's in books there's movies made so what is their the press  threw his shit out there not me i'm just talking about me now what changed it though when i was  asking about uh your dad what what was it that actually made people go oh we can somehow talk about  this publicly because years ago you just didn't no one did reporters would talk about it i think  there's so many movies out there and like sopranos brought us so into that world and it's the public 
[02:55:30]  fascination with it i mean come on john gott is doing a movie so what's the difference now basically  we're sitting here bringing people into a world and we're not talking about men and saying this is  what they sat down and did there are books out there people can read on that we're talking about women  and what happens when the men go to prison and what we go through and how we pick up the pieces and you  know by far i'm not sitting here portraying us as victims but we're real women going through real  things and surviving so we're going to let you see a life that you think might be a bowl of cherries 
[02:56:00]  i got the pits to prove it well we i think a lot of people these days kind of assume it's not the  easiest thing uh to be married to uh some guy that was in the mob uh involved in crime in any way  especially when they're in prison and stuff like that i can't get a date i was just 
[02:56:30]  because i'm not with my uncle my son's father for 12 years i've had maybe i kid you not i think i've  had maybe one serious boyfriend in 12 years and i don't date men do men let alone scared off are they  scared off they're scared because she's i'm a little intimidating you think  now you put me on a show called my boys yeah it's done here's why you're intimidating because you're  you're loud and you would tell me what i'm doing wrong in bed i like something like she would point 
[02:57:00]  it out you know like you you call that head like you know i would want to know nicely  i'm not that loud yeah is there fights on the show my hair no i need to know if you girls uh  fight is there fights on the show yeah they're not i haven't seen it no i told you i didn't see  it this is a last minute thing i'm gonna go see it there's a lot of struggles and a lot of ups and  downs back after you watch oh really i knew though i mean the way you can watch tv now you can dvr  something the whole see everything's repeated it's like you can show it 30 times could we just get a 
[02:57:30]  quick because i think the audience especially would love to know uh a quick like who the your  husband was or is and what like quickly what they were involved in um my husband was joe ferragamo  and he got arrested for stockboard okay my father is sammy the bull gravano and he is just sammy the  bull gravano he was the underboss of the gambino family and then he cooperated i'm renee graziano  daughter of um anthony graziano who is according to the government the involved in this world we 
[02:58:00]  do not speak about according to the government and then i got it according to the government  and then i have an ex-husband who is this is his third time going in jeez oh my god and i'm and i  have a 17 year old son how much time is he gonna get for the third um uh hopefully it's not as much as  it was the last time what was the last time the last time was seven he did seven it was more than 
[02:58:30]  that wow but like i said my son's turning 17 in two days from now happy birthday do you have a cot at  the courthouse i'm sorry do you have a cot over there she has a valet parking and of course my my husband  um is uh lee devanzo and he's a professional burglar oh  you know what and honestly i have to clarify because they keep seeing bank robber but he's  not a bank robber because bank robber goes in armed yeah yeah he's a bank burglar through the 
[02:59:00]  ceiling through the wall take it out they show up in the morning yeah they show up in the morning and  go what happened what happened it took my money yes and they keep everyone keeps thinking it's bank  robber right right is it uh when you're growing up or whatever and people know that you're associated  with certain people is it kind of nice to have that to know that no one's gonna bought like you  know everybody knew who your dad was growing up is it kind of nice to have that like no one's gonna  fuck with me at school or that's got to be a nice perk she's raising her definitely that's the perk of 
[02:59:30]  the dance you don't have to wait online yeah you know what but i always shied away from that like  when people go oh you know your father's sammy the bull come here it was actually kind of  weird to me i was never the girl that went up to the front of the line and said do you know  know who i am that was renee that was renee you used it yeah i was always i always downplayed it  i grew up when it was um i guess when they started to make all these movies so i kind of ran with it 
[03:00:00]  yeah yeah it was probably one of those yeah very not it was it was a not sort of natural for me it  was because your friends probably knew and kind of well i only stayed with a certain group of people  and everybody was the same and not that my father told me to run around using my mouth like that and  saying this and that it was basically i went to places where everyone already knew so it was just  a given yeah so you know i kind of enjoyed it i mean growing up in new york in the heyday of the mob 
[03:00:30]  it was like growing up in hollywood like these gangsters were celebrities so we kind of were born  into that and we didn't know any different especially uh john gott yeah absolutely it was  you know he was out there every day were guys terrified to hit on you because i would be  horrified to have to go home and meet your father and get the wrong impression absolutely i think so  yeah so guys treated you well and said it respectfully yes yes how do they break up with you yeah exactly  that's what i need now text message yeah from three states away yeah they're like gone you never see 
[03:01:00]  him again do you still see do you still see your dad or were you seeing him absolutely yes and do you  remember any any of you do you remember any things growing up that you thought but in hindsight you go  like wow that's what happened like that was bad shit oh yeah and at the time yeah you kind of  remember yeah yeah do you remember do you remember like your dad coming home and and and then he after  hearing testimony think holy shit that was the night that you know yeah that's why i'm writing  i'm writing a book yeah yeah yeah because i have all these memories and different things and it's 
[03:01:30]  just you know it's it's the way the kid perceives this lifestyle and that's really the message that  you know we're all trying to put out there and how it does affect children and how you push past it  never brought their work home if that's what you were getting at um my all i know about my dad is that  my father had a trucking company and um of course he did no he did he really did my father did all  his life my father let me tell you something about my dad yeah because you know here goes renee and her  father my father had four jobs when he first married my mom and did everything under the sun to make 
[03:02:00]  sure my mom had a better life because she they had a child when they were young so my father you know  started a trucking company so when i was a kid i would go to the trucking company i'd love to go to work  with my dad i would get all the pens with the names on it so as a child you don't you don't think  anything it worked until maybe i was in fourth or fifth grade that someone glued an article about  my dad on my desk and in catholic school fucking rat no in catholic school that's terrible and that 
[03:02:30]  was my first you know like hey dad and he was like mind your business you should eat what your mother  made and you don't you don't question your father yeah who are you to question your father yeah yeah  i like my face but but you still you still thought about it you didn't question it but  no now you didn't even think about it i think about it for a second but i don't think you know  you think about it and then it goes away as a kid you don't say hey dad had you pay the mortgage this 
[03:03:00]  month like you know you don't think about what they do when they leave the house but how do you how  do you deal with as as just a person now we're just human beings sitting in here how do you deal with the  fact that your father killed a lot of people hey i deal with it i deal with it and i understand  that lifestyle by any means do i condone that but that's what that world is i mean the reality is  it's all glitz and glamour and hollywood but people don't recognize that there is a downside to it and  that's what i experienced both sides of that lifestyle i don't condone it my father was a gangster 
[03:03:30]  and that's what gangsters do does that affect though any way that you feel about him personally  i look at him like my father i mean in my world people want to say they don't like  him because he cooperated but they like him if he killed people so to me i took everything outside  of it and as a father that's how i judge him do i believe that everything he did was right no but  that's what he chose and he has to live with it he's sitting in a prison cell and he's dealing with  everything that he did in his life didn't he cooperate because he heard tape of people who were  willing to throw him under the bus and he was like well fuck this i'm not gonna go down he heard tapes 
[03:04:00]  that john gott he was speaking of him and then you know there was a lot to it when he had lawyers  that you know were representing him and it was just basically he was gonna take the fall and i  think he was just done with that life i mean at first he probably thought of killing john and then  he got up one day and said i'm done i'm done with this world i'm done with it and to be honest with  you whatever he did he did for himself he doesn't care what people think about him he wasn't scared he  was when he said when i became a gangster i didn't become a gangster because i wanted people's approval  and that's the same way when i cooperated i did what i felt was right and i was just done with that 
[03:04:30]  lifestyle he felt like there was so much backstabbing and betrayal and you know it a lot  of it had to do with the gaudy tapes so he heard john's voice on tapes and that that's pretty much  his decision so he's a pretty fearless guy fearless yes yeah that's right remember that okay  we uh we got to get him out of here unfortunately no no no no they said five minutes ago  well this show looks like it's gonna be it's already it's interesting i hope you guys watch 
[03:05:00]  it of course we didn't know you guys were coming in we would have been more prepared but i think  we did all right we had fun though even though we didn't see it right and remember we were a good  time right we were respectful yeah everything's okay right crazy there in the beginning everything  was good mob wives on vh we're gonna take uh photos with the mob wives and we'll see you guys  tomorrow yeah it's fine the virus sirius xf sirius xf obi and anthony the anthony show damn it </pre>
