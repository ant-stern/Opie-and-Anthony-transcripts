<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Anthony discussing his new video webcast, which he jokingly called "TV on the radio."  This webcast featured a segment showcasing his friend Steve’s World War II memorabilia collection, including Nazi artifacts, filmed ironically on Hitler’s birthday, April 20th (also associated with 4/20 cannabis culture).  Technical difficulties with the webcast’s video playback were a recurring issue.  The hosts then transitioned into reminiscing about old Real Rock TV segments, specifically clips Opie was uploading to his YouTube channel, "Opie Radio."  These included Opie choking on a turkey (with Anthony jokingly performing the Heimlich), and a segment showing them driving, with Opie playfully considering running a red light. Opie’s wife’s embarrassment over these clips was noted, as was a past studio incident involving halogen lights catching fire.  The discussion included listener calls, mentions of other side projects, and details about their new SiriusXM studio, its proximity to Howard Stern’s, and interactions with other SiriusXM staff and their speculation on their colleagues’ opinions of the show.  They briefly discussed the movie *Observe and Report* and the number of *Revenge of the Nerds* films.  Sam was mentioned as assisting with technical aspects, alongside Steve who appeared in the World War II segment.

A large portion of the show focused on movie previews and their tendency to spoil plots, with vulgar language used throughout.  The hosts and callers discussed *Observe and Report*, *The Hangover* (with a hilarious Mike Tyson cameo), *Cast Away*, *Sixth Sense*, *Pineapple Express*, *Valkyrie*, *Inglourious Basterds*, and the upcoming Sacha Baron Cohen film *Bruno*, including its lengthy title and the Ali G Show. A caller even shared an audio recording of their bowel movements after taking a laxative.  The Miss California USA pageant controversy was also covered, specifically Carrie Prejean's answer regarding same-sex marriage and Perez Hilton’s role as a judge. The hosts shared their opinions, often using vulgar and offensive language toward both Prejean and Hilton, and extensively discussed Hilton's blog and perceived bias.  Digressions included discussions about the attractiveness of pageant contestants and the hosts’ experiences with gay friends. Stephen Hawking's illness was also briefly mentioned, alongside a caller's humorous question about whether the hosts had visited a location similar to that in *Brokeback Mountain*.


The show continued with further discussion of Stephen Hawking’s health, longevity, and personal life, with crude jokes made about his condition. The conversation shifted to beauty pageants and poorly edited TV movie clips, particularly focusing on censorship of the word "motherfucker" in *Snakes on a Plane*.  A significant portion of the show featured an interview with pornographic actress Sunset Thomas.  The conversation covered her upcoming book, *Anatomy of an Adult Film*, her career, retirement from porn, personal life (including her husband's reaction to her profession and her sexual preferences), and interactions with fans, including a contest winner in her final film.  The interview was filled with sexually explicit jokes and discussions, including detailed descriptions of sexual acts and body parts, and discussion of her body modifications.  Numerous listener calls were interspersed, often adding to or diverting conversation. A video of a monkey fighting a cobra was shown and related to the *Snakes on a Plane* clips. The show concluded with continued discussion of Sunset Thomas's book and career.


The next segment featured Sunset Thomas discussing her book, endorsements from Larry Flint, Ron Jeremy, and Nina Hartley, and a comparison of old and new pornography, focusing on plot versus explicit content.  She discussed her work at The Wild Horse gentlemen's club, condom use, STIs in the adult film industry, and watched clips of old pornographic films, with crude and sexually explicit comments from the hosts.  The conversation covered her hobbies (horse riding and boxing) and a bizarre anecdote about a friend enjoying breast punching, leading to a spontaneous spanking session involving Sunset, Opie, and producer Jimmy.  Adult film star Brie Olson then joined, recounting a negative experience on Bubba the Love Sponge's show, which involved unwanted filming after a supposed “blind” man handjob segment she felt was a hoax.  The hosts expressed support for Brie.  A significant portion focused on a budding romantic interest between Brie and Jim Norton, with flirtatious banter and details about Brie's other films and a contest on Twisties (VoteBree.com).  Brie shared a mishap story involving an enema and an anal sex scene.  The segment ended with continued discussion of Brie's career and romantic prospects with Norton, and sexually explicit comments and jokes.


The final segment featured Brie Olsen discussing her online presence, including her Twitter and website (BrieOlsen.com) featuring explicit adult content.  A graphic sex scene she filmed (which her webmaster refused to post due to obscenity concerns) was discussed in detail, including her injuries. She offered a “secret link” to the video for her Twitter followers. The conversation involved her feelings about Jim Norton, her crush, and her relationship with Dane Cook.  Other topics included the hosts’ use of iPhones, an air traffic control game, promotion of VoteBrie.com, a large pixelated penis on the Maury Povich show, her purchase of a life-sized sex toy, and Norton’s perceived lack of communication with Olsen. The segment concluded with plugging various websites and social media accounts, including VoteBrie.com, BrieOlsen.com, and OP Radio.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Check, check, check. Yeah.  That was too loud.  All right.  A little tweaking going on. A little tweaking. Get lost. 
[00:00:30]  Get lost. Wow. Scram.  I don't mean that in a bad way.  Hit the bricks.  I don't think people understand how fragile radio show hosts are, even after all these years.  I love when you say, oh, wow, something's wrong.  And then engineers and everyone compiling in here and they're like, they're fidgeting around you  and just assume you could keep your concentration and do the radio show.  Fidgeting.  We could do a little tweeting during the break there, Mars, is what I'm getting at. 
[00:01:00]  All right. Good morning. Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Good morning.  I was just talking to Anthony about the fine radio show you were doing last night.  I want to hear more about this.  Yes. It's more a TV kind of radio show, which is odd. It's an odd little transitional thing to do.  It's called TV on the radio, my friend.  It's TV on the radio. I don't know what to call it, but it's a video webcast.  I said that for my music fans out there.  Oh, is that it? 
[00:01:30]  There's a band called TV on the radio.  Ah.  Oh.  And Earl turned me on to TV on the radio.  Earl.  And I turned off TV on the radio after a while.  Not good?  All right. There's a couple cool songs, actually, but not really worth getting too involved here.  Yeah.  I'll just give them a little acknowledgement that I know they're alive.  So you're doing TV on the radio.  Yeah. I figured I'd, because I have like a studio down in the basement.  So, Ma, I got to do this now. Ma. 
[00:02:00]  So I got a studio down there in the basement, and it's video.  You know, it's not just audio, but it's set up like a radio studio.  You know, I got the mics and the board and everything like that.  So it's weird, because I'm kind of doing like a radio thing, but there's video.  So it's weird to incorporate the video into it, because, you know, usually we just sit here. 
[00:02:30]  It's not much visual stuff.  We just kind of talk and everything.  And now to bring like some kind of visual medium is kind of interesting.  I do have a green screen.  That's cool.  So I do have fun with backdrops.  I could change like the backdrops.  Is there a website where you can just get all the backdrops you want?  Yeah.  How do you get your backdrops?  I just pull any picture off of Google Images and make that what I'm in front of.  It's amazing.  Huh.  Last night was the Reichstag building. 
[00:03:00]  That's what I'm getting at.  You had your 420 show yesterday.  It was amazing.  Well, Steve from Bayshore was over.  And if you know Steve, he's an avid collector of World War II memorabilia.  He sure is.  And he came over the house last night with some memorabilia.  And, you know, he was showing me what he's got.  And then I just decided, you know something?  This is a good thing to do on the little webcast.  So we went down to the basement and fired it up and just started showing off. 
[00:03:30]  And he's telling all the stories of where these things came from.  And he's been over to Germany like five times.  So he's talked to actual people that were involved with the Nazi organization.  Look at you tiptoeing.  Well, he did.  You know, he knows a lot of history about that.  Yeah.  That era.  And he's got this old Nazi helmet that was buried in the ground since, like, well, the 40s, obviously. 
[00:04:00]  And since 96, they pulled it out of the ground.  It was all rusted.  He's digging up graves.  That's good.  Grave robbing.  He's grave robbing.  Yes, a little grave robbing in Germany.  That's wonderful, Steve.  But no more free beer for you at FH, you creep.  We hung out down there and just kind of did a show for a little over an hour.  I guess it was about an hour and 20 minutes of, like, his show and tell of all his little doodads and items. 
[00:04:30]  He's got tablecloths and dish towels from, like, the Reich buildings and just amazing stuff.  What's his coolest thing he brought over?  Well, the bayonet was pretty cool.  Wow.  It was almost a weird moment when his bayonet actually fit on my Mauser.  Oh, wonderful.  What a wonderful moment.  It was almost like some kind of sick sex.  It's like a your chocolate's in my peanut butter commercial. 
[00:05:00]  That's what I was thinking, too.  It's kind of like that.  He's got an army backpack with, they put pony hair on the back of it because it's water resistant.  Who knew that?  And he's got that.  But I think the stuff that actually came from, he's got a little jar with pieces of mosaic in it that were in this giant mosaic in, you know, one of these real Nazi buildings and things like that. 
[00:05:30]  And just his, you know, he's got a bunch of goods and his information that he's got about his stuff and the areas that it came from.  He's got autographed photos from, you could get autographed photos from the era.  Well, he actually went when he was in Germany and went to a guy's house that is in a picture with Adolf Hitler.  A guy's house that is being, that is wanted by the authorities.  Well, who knows? 
[00:06:00]  I don't know.  I just, and it's an autographed picture from him.  So it was, and he's in the picture shaking hands with Hitler.  And that's his autographed picture.  Was it he known or was it like a meet and greet?  No, he knew him.  He knew him pretty well.  Yeah, it was just, he's got plenty of stuff.  No one has a problem that this guy is still alive?  Like, what's that about?  He's in Germany.  He's living, he wasn't a.  But even, aren't the Germans even like, we've got to get rid of all this? 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, you can't, you can't even display a swastika or anything like that.  I mean, it's criminal over there to do it.  But, no, a lot of the German Nazis, unless you were a, you know, SS officer or in charge of one of the camps, things like that,  were just soldiers, you know, that once they were done with their duty and the Nazis surrendered and Germany surrendered,  they just went home.  They went home like any other soldiers do. 
[00:07:00]  You know, not all of them were war criminals.  A lot of them were just soldiers.  Soldiers fighting a war.  Serving on the wrong side, apparently.  But, you know, it was kind of an interesting little show and tell there last night.  Now, does Steve get the invite to come back?  Oh, of course.  He made the cut.  Steve made the cut.  Steve is actually my first guest.  Because some of these people, they're going to come down to the basement to do the TV on the radio, 
[00:07:30]  whatever you're going to end up calling it.  It's live at the compound.  Live at the compound.  Yeah.  And they're not going to be invited back.  No, no, they won't make the cut.  You'll have to, like, keep them, you know, like, no, no, no, we're going to have you back soon.  No, no, really, really.  Yeah.  Danny was going to be the first guest, but we were too drunk to figure out how to work the machinery.  Oh, that's good.  What day was that?  That was the day I dropped my blackberry in the toilet.  Oh, yeah.  That was Saturday night.  We were going to do a little Saturday night show.  See, it comes up black when you try to rebroadcast things, though, for some reason. 
[00:08:00]  I've got to get in touch with the Mogulist people, because I am on Mogulist.com slash Anthony Radio.  And it's M-O-G-U-L-U-S.  And it just comes up black when I try to replay it, but the live broadcasts come up fine.  And if you hit the on-demand, this is for anybody that's checking out.  Wait, wait, wait, hold on.  If you hit rebroadcast, you can hear the audio, but not...  Yeah, you can hear the audio.  I don't know.  There's some kind of glitch that I'm having with Mogulist as far as them playing my video. 
[00:08:30]  So now you're hearing audio, but it's audio of pretty much a show-and-tell.  So it's like, hey, look at this, and no one sees anything.  But the on-demand button, if you hit that and then go to, it'll say World War II long clip or something or whatever one,  you could go to that one, as Danny is demonstrating here, and it will pop up.  Oh, there it is.  There is me and Steve from Bayshore in front of the Reichstag building. 
[00:09:00]  Steve looks like he's a Russian officer.  This looks like an old-school SNL event.  Oh, it does.  It feels like it, too.  It's live at the compound, a look back for 20.  And here we are.  And then later on in the broadcast, of course, the goods come out,  and we start describing various items that Stephen has brought.  To the house.  But we have, you know, the radio mics are there, the headphones, the compressor, the board. 
[00:09:30]  You could have, like, a hot model, like, bringing his, like, stuff in front of the camera.  Yeah, yeah.  And now, blah, blah is displayed.  Well, I'm waiting for Big Kev to give back my other camera,  so I could do a two-camera shoot,  so I could then transfer to another camera when I'm demonstrating something else.  But in the meantime, it's pretty much just this shot of us in front of that building.  But I could do anything.  Like I said, I put the Larry King thing behind me occasionally.  Sometimes just the weather map.  Yeah.  And I'll just do phony weather.  More importantly, is that a Budweiser or a Guinness? 
[00:10:00]  I can't really tell.  That is a Bud Light.  It is a Bud Light.  I am partaking in there.  I know that sounds, I couldn't really see it.  I know, like, it's very obvious if it's a Bud Light or a Guinness.  But your big graphic that we always bitch about that the TV stations do is covering your beer.  Well, at one point last night, we were showing something off,  and the graphic was covering it up, and I said, Jimmy would be mad at this.  What I am going to do now is pull the graphic down,  so I pulled it down so you could see everything, and then popped it back up. 
[00:10:30]  You should actually get a graphic that covers, like, 60%.  I'm also going to do that at some point, maybe when Jimmy comes down.  It only covers the crucial parts.  Yes.  Yes, the very crucial parts, the things that you want to see.  You've got to get a few different sets.  Someone on the line is...  Oh, I have plenty.  I have lots of sets.  No, no, not just green screen sets.  Like, someone's suggesting you get the old Merv Griffin, like, show set.  I could actually just do that.  But you should get furniture, like you're setting up, you know, 
[00:11:00]  kind of a Jay Leno or a Tonight Show type of thing.  Pull the camera back a little and show a little more like that.  Yeah, a desk and a couple of couches.  I could do that.  A silly microphone on your desk.  And a Rupert Pumpkin type of thing with one cardboard cutout person.  Cardboard cutout you.  Yes, you look good too, Jerry.  That looks good, man.  Yeah.  That looks good, man.  Oh, it's a lot of fun.  Especially, you know, you get someone like Steve from Bayshore. 
[00:11:30]  He's a very funny guy.  Came down there.  And when it's such a visual thing of him showing off his wares, it worked out well.  And it was very off the cuff last night.  We just decided, you know, at a moment's notice to just go down there and fire it up and do it.  So it was a lot of fun.  Well, that's the beauty of this whole thing.  No rules.  You just turn on a camera and go, you know what, I'm broadcasting now.  That's it.  Just having fun.  And people are like, you should Twitter when you're going to be on.  It's like, I don't know what I'm going to be on.  I just figured I'd, you know.  You just go and do it. 
[00:12:00]  Throw it on.  And like I said, if you want to check it out, the On Demand button at the bottom of the window  is a better way to check it out than trying to listen or watch it streaming.  Right.  Because I'm having an issue there.  I've got to get in touch with the Mogulish people.  But On Demand is there.  Everything I've done so far is available On Demand.  Some better than others.  Yeah.  And it's just a lot of fun.  And I'm drinking beer during the whole thing.  Beer, beer, beer.  How much time to man?  It's nothing.  Oh.  It's free.  For now.  People just go on.  For now. 
[00:12:30]  Free.  For now.  He's giving you a taste.  Then I'll charge you for it.  Nah, I'm just, you know.  For now.  Down there.  Yeah, we're stupid.  We give all our stuff away for free.  That's it.  We're just dummies.  It is fun, though.  But I think in general it just helps, you know, the brand.  Yeah, that's all.  It's a fun thing.  It's in my stupid basement.  I throw backgrounds of, like, the first background before this one, before we changed it, you  know, to have a thematic thing with the show, was something I left up and it was just the 
[00:13:00]  Bridge of the Enterprise.  Nice.  And I'm sitting on the Bridge of the Enterprise doing a radio show.  Very good.  It's very silly.  It's very silly indeed.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  When I do it, I want us to be in the midst of a tranny club.  That's absolutely possible.  There's no scene that we cannot come up with to put behind that.  And it can be moving video also.  So, yeah, that would be nice to have a meat spin in the background, just a giant schlong  spinning around. 
[00:13:30]  A place where there's no rules.  Yes.  Even the satellite radio's got some of those rules.  Yeah, this is just, you know.  Making their way into the game.  Obviously, I wouldn't say anything on here that they could then take the clip, play it  on the news out of context, and get me in trouble.  I wouldn't do that.  There's a moral issue there.  That's a matter of time.  That's only a matter of time.  With all the Guinness that you're drinking at the compound at.  Before I slip.  That's a matter of time.  There's no dump button there or anything.  Like what?  You don't think that the German building and them celebrating Hitler's birthday by showing 
[00:14:00]  Nazi stuff would be a pullable?  Now, Jim, if you were watching last night, you would have heard three times over the course  of the broadcast that I said, this is not a celebration.  I said that three times.  It is not a celebration.  I am using the date, 420, which is also a date for pot smokers.  It's also a horrible date in history with Columbine anniversary.  But it is also Adolf Hitler's birthday.  And using just that date to get a little history on the era and on the German military 
[00:14:30]  through an expert like Steve from Bayshore, who has been to Germany five times and has  a lot of memorabilia and looks like a Russian officer.  I'm looking at the video.  He looks very confident to me.  Oh, and he's in a chair that's much too tall.  Yeah, I see that.  Like, that's one of my bar stools.  But you're supposed to be in the tall chair.  I did jack my chair up later on.  You're supposed to be in the tall chair in the power position. 
[00:15:00]  I know.  I had to jack my chair up later so I could get on an even keel with him.  But I got to get another chair.  I think we're confusing a lot of people because we're both doing our little side projects,  and they're fun.  Yeah, they're just fun.  They're fun.  The radio show is still the big get, but now we're, like, branching out and doing, like,  little side projects.  You know what it is?  There's just so much available to do on the Internet these days, so you might as well do it.  It's like it's out there.  My thing, just to, while you were doing that, I was going through the old Real Rock TV shows. 
[00:15:30]  Yes, I saw that on your Twitter.  I got every single show, it turns out, that we did up there in Boston.  Great.  And I love the comments because I put the first clip up last night, and I'm going to  be putting a Real Rock TV clip up, just one a day for the next couple of weeks, just one  a day.  I'm holding back.  I got five more deuce chill clips ready to go.  And that's exactly how it was described.  Oh, yeah.  Wait.  Can we get the audio of this up on the board? 
[00:16:00]  Oh, my God.  What is that gentleman doing?  PC?  Oh, my God.  This is the first one.  I got a YouTube channel called Opie Radio, one word.  This is kind of a big day.  Oh, wait.  Hang on a second.  Oh, look.  I was still me with my Nazi audio.  I'm just a bunch of lunatics.  And in this clip, by the way, it's on YouTube right now with Opie and Anthony Old School.  Opie Radio is the YouTube channel or whatever. 
[00:16:30]  You get to see Rocco.  Dude, no way.  Rocco's the one that looks like Danny McBride.  Danny McBride.  Someone's like, wow, you worked with Kenny Powers back in AF?  Dude, come on.  Let me see Rocco.  I haven't seen this, by the way, since we've done it.  Well, it was posted after I kind of hit the hay there, and I couldn't get it on my iPhone.  Yeah, I got other things I want to do as far as side projects go, but this is going to take up my time for the next easily two or three weeks. 
[00:17:00]  I got a stack of tapes that go from the floor all the way up to the ceiling.  I am prepared for a douche chill moment.  And I'm watching these things going, I don't even know what I'm going to see.  I don't remember this stuff.  And then it pops on the screen.  I'm like, oh, my God.  And for the people that think that they got one on me, you don't think, I know that I'm putting this stuff up there.  You're the one putting it up.  My wife couldn't watch half this stuff.  She was embarrassed.  She goes, you're representing both of us these days, not just yourself. 
[00:17:30]  This is the most douche-chilly thing I've ever seen in my life.  Why do you like being uncomfortable?  Why do you throw yourself under a bus?  I'm like, I don't know.  It's just representing Captain Hook's Fish and Chips.  Dude, she didn't think this was good quality stuff.  I love how Jimmy asked those obvious questions, knowing what the answer is.  Wait, so you didn't like this?  You thought this was bad?  I know.  I know.  We all know Ope's wife.  And I could just picture the face watching something. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, just douche-chilling.  She openly just starts laughing, not with me, but at me.  She just openly starts laughing.  I'm like, why do you like being uncomfortable?  Oh, my God.  And for the people, I understand what this looks like 10 years later.  I understand that.  So shut your trap and enjoy some nostalgia, some Opey and Anthony nostalgia.  With that, we'll give you the audio version of the video that's now up on YouTube.  Here it is. 
[00:18:30]  We'll describe it.  We're all at dinner.  Yeah, you can stop it for a second.  Oh, this is a Thanksgiving thing.  Yeah, we were doing a Thanksgiving bit for Real Rock TV.  Right.  And all the jocks are around the conference table having a full Thanksgiving dinner.  Yeah, yeah.  And that was Chris, I think his name was, from the Hillman show?  Yep.  Who actually was always a cool dude, by the way.  Yeah.  The Hillman's a douchebag.  He showed his true colors when we got fired.  He's an asshole.  Man, look at Rocco. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, but the guys that worked with him weren't that bad.  And Chris is doing the Charlie Chaplin, like...  Two dinner rolls with, like, little pencils in them for the legs dancing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  That's how the video starts.  And then I'm...  That's Rocco?  That's Rocco.  That's Kenny Powers.  Dude, I got a mullet.  Rocco.  I think that's the first look at Rocco ever.  Yeah.  We've been talking about him forever.  Yeah, that's it.  Dude, I've been hearing about that guy.  I feel like I'm watching Zellig.  Like, there he is. 
[00:19:30]  There he is, dude.  That's Rocco.  All right.  And then I'm taking a nice big bite of turkey.  All right.  To start the bit.  Ooh.  What are you going to hear?  I'm cold.  Hold me.  I think the setup should be, I'm swallowing a big piece of turkey, which is going to lead  to me choking.  Oh, okay.  That's the bit premise.  Yes.  All right.  Because then Anthony gets very excited.  Oh, no.  Do you even remember what you did here?  I have no clue what this is about.  I'm ready to just get a douche chill. 
[00:20:00]  All right.  Hit it.  Oh, no.  There's me swallowing a turkey.  Oh, God.  But I never even had any kidneys.  No!  You all right?  Oh, you okay?  Okay.  Oh, wait a minute.  I knew what that means.  He wants to place your age.  Okay.  All right.  Come on.  Two words.  First word.  Sounds like, um, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas.  Wait, wait, wait.  Oh, no. 
[00:20:30]  He's choking.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Choking your highlight.  I'm the highlight.  Stay calm.  Stay calm.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  You all right, dude?  You all right?  You have to let people know the sight gag they just missed.  Oh, we're going to.  We went for the big sight gag.  Big laugh you guys missed.  See, I was choking.  Opie is choking.  And Anthony gave me the Heimlich, which we didn't show on camera because we don't touch 
[00:21:00]  each other ever.  And then, um.  So you had to just believe that it was giving me the Heimlich.  Oh, my God.  And then the turkey comes out, right, Jimmy?  Well, no, you don't see it.  What you see is.  Yeah.  You see Opie choking.  And then all of a sudden the camera goes to the table to a pan where a turkey would go.  And then, by golly, a turkey just flies from off camera into the pan.  You have to assume that's what he was choking on was the whole turkey.  The entire turkey carcass.  Yes.  Yeah.  Which was, I guess, caught in his throat. 
[00:21:30]  Yes.  See, I.  I, but then.  There's too much to talk about for that visual, man.  Wow.  Wow.  That's one of many, my friend.  Oh, gee.  I will hold back, but sometime after, I don't know, noon today, the second clip will go up.  One a day.  I'm going to hold back.  I'm going to just do one a day.  Very excited to see the next clip.  Actually, if you want.  I don't even know. 
[00:22:00]  Sam is helping me out with this, and he could maybe tell us which one's going up today.  There's another turkey bit.  Wow.  The turkey bits were just flying, I guess.  Look at Sam running down the hall.  He can't wait to come in.  Look at those goose feet he's got.  Whack, whack, whack, whack.  Whack, whack.  Sam.  You look silly when you walk.  Never mind run.  What were you guys talking about while I was running?  Hold on, hold on.  What were we talking about?  Sam.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're helping me out with these tapes, because it's going from VHS to. 
[00:22:30]  It's a DVD.  Yeah, we're digitizing.  Yes, we are.  Now, what's the next bit that goes up today around noon?  I think we'll stay on the turkey theme, because a lot of people want to know what else can  they do with a turkey.  What else?  You know something?  Are you embarrassed to see that?  Yes.  Like it makes you really uncomfortable?  Oh, my God, Opie!  Yeah.  You're choking!  Over the top.  The badness.  No, that was great.  You're playing charades, and all of a sudden, your friend's sick. 
[00:23:00]  How are you supposed to know?  No, see, he gets sick first.  Oh.  And I see him choking, and I go, oh, my God.  And people think I'm going to say, Opie's choking, but I go, let's see he wants to play  charades.  Oh, Anthony.  Because he's doing the universal sign for choking, and I'm like, it's just such a party.  But then wouldn't charades be over, because that's an obvious one, the choking.  Yeah, yeah.  We suck.  And by the way, who starts charades without saying a word?  You say, let's play charades, everybody.  You don't just begin clutching your throat, and all of a sudden, charades has commenced. 
[00:23:30]  That would be problem number 835 with that whole clip, an idea behind it.  Well, the problem is, for real, that I saved all these.  You don't have one copy of our Real Rec TV shows, right?  Exactly.  I got every single one of them.  Like Lucas doesn't have a copy of the Star Wars Christmas special, and there's good reason  for it.  They're great copies, because I didn't even tape them off the TV. 
[00:24:00]  This is right off the master, my friend.  Oh, was it off the master?  Oh, yeah.  This is good quality shit.  It is very good quality.  He's actually aired?  Yes.  Oh, these were on the Spanish television channel up there.  We were big TV stars, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Big TV stars.  Every week, it was WAF, Real Rock TV.  Can we hear it again, though?  No.  I don't think we described it accurately to people as we were going.  No.  All right.  I don't know what happens.  I think I just black out, and instead of feeling uncomfortable, I just kind of openly 
[00:24:30]  laugh in myself.  Laugh, yeah.  Yeah.  Jimmy, we'll play it again if you describe what's going on.  Yeah, of course I have to, because it's a very funny bit, but it's visual.  So the people can't see what's happening.  All right.  Starts off at the table, laughing, having fun.  Guys doing the...  Charlie Chaplin roll.  Yeah.  It's terrific.  Ops choking.  Oh, I had to sell it.  That looked like a big piece of turkey going in my mouth.  But I never even had any kidneys. 
[00:25:00]  And doing a punchline to a fine joke.  Yes.  Everyone loves it.  Everybody's killing.  Ops begins choking.  I laughed so far and started choking.  I was actually nervous the first time I saw it.  I'm like, he's choking.  Anthony jumps up.  First words.  First words.  Now Ops is really choking.  He's standing up, holding his neck.  Wait, wait.  Wait, wait.  Close.  Close.  Close.  Close.  Close.  No.  He's choking.  What?  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Heimlich.  Heimlich.  Heimlich. 
[00:25:30]  Heimlich.  Heimlich.  Heimlich.  Heimlich.  Heimlich.  Heimlich.  Heimlich.  Heimlich.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, now there's the pan.  The turkey just flies in it.  Yes.  The whole carcass.  Yes.  The whole thing.  And then Prince Valiant is okay.  Yes.  Who is that youth?  Jesus.  Oh, were we so young?  Yes, you were.  I don't know what happened.  And the great part of this, by the way, is the good editing, like Ed Wood would do.  You see in the beginning of the clip, oh, putting a sliver of turkey into his mouth.  And at the end, you see the entire bird carcass, a turkey might grow out of his sliver.  It's very possibly he was eating the last part of the giant piece of turkey. 
[00:26:00]  Now, my hair is horrendous, first of all.  Well, what's wrong with your hair?  The part that really got my girl, by the way, was at the end of the video, I take my fingers  and put my hair behind my ear.  Yes.  She goes, that's what a girl would do.  Exactly.  And then she actually got out of bed and said, I'm watching TV in the living room.  And she left the bedroom.  And that's the last I've heard of my girl.  Oh.  She hates when I put this stuff up. 
[00:26:30]  That is really...  That's one of many, Ann.  I can't wait.  What's today's clip?  It's another turkey theme.  Yeah, we're going to stick with the turkeys because later on this afternoon, we're all  going turkey bowling.  Oh, God, no, we're not.  Do you remember in the bar?  Yeah, that I remember.  Do you got the guy, like, blowing the flame?  I remember that now.  Who's the flame? 
[00:27:00]  Bartender tried to be cool and, you know, blow the vodka and light it.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what?  The clip also reminded me of a little peripheral thing.  Those halogen lights that were all over the place.  Oh, shit.  Do you remember that?  It was these halogen lights that got up to, like, 1,000 degrees and the bulb was exposed.  Well, they were saucers.  It was like in a saucer.  It was like in a bowl.  Yeah.  The light fixture part was a bowl, and inside, it was on a stand that was about five feet 
[00:27:30]  tall or so, and inside was this halogen bulb.  And these things have since been outlawed, I believe, because Opie would just roll up  paper and, like a basketball, try to shoot it into the bowl.  Behind Anthony.  Behind me.  Live on the air.  Yeah, on the air.  And they would just burst into flames behind me, and I'd be like, you smell something?  Ah!  It would be burning.  I'd have to unplug the light, tip it over, get the fire out of it, and stomp it out. 
[00:28:00]  It got to be like Yosemite Sam with Bugs Bunny throwing the match down in the gunpowder  room on the ship.  You do that again, I'm not going to get it.  There is another clip coming up a little later on, probably this week.  Well, it's one a day.  Right.  I could put five up easy, but I'm going to spread this stuff out and so you guys really  enjoy it.  Oh, it's best to, because you have to savor each one with numerous plays.  You have to watch it a few times to get the whole thing.  Yes, Jimmy.  Today is fucking Tuesday. 
[00:28:30]  I want my Tuesday clip.  That's Monday's clip.  I want Tuesday's clip, too.  You'll get Tuesday's clip, I guess.  After the show.  After the show.  No.  After the show.  No.  I want Tuesday's clip now.  There's got to be one clip a day in the morning.  And this way, because otherwise, you're always yesterday's clip, today's clip.  I want to put a clip up after every radio show and then people enjoy it until the next  live radio show.  Then they can call and discuss it.  Deuce Chiller is pointing out something here. 
[00:29:00]  He's saying, I love that once Opie's on camera, he can't stop looking into it.  Hey, it was our first shot of TV.  Oh, that's fantastic.  I think if you post them in the morning and we talk about the clip, that will get views  up because people will have heard the description and they'll have to go, oh, this is what's  going on.  Will it ever?  All right.  You're right.  This is Tuesday's clip, then.  That's Monday's clip.  I want Tuesday's clip.  That means we don't have to put a clip up today.  You're absolutely right, Jimmy.  No, I want a second clip. 
[00:29:30]  Later today.  I want a second clip.  And now.  That's why I'm spreading this out because people are begging to see more Deuce Chiller  theater.  Wait until I see you guys driving.  What's that one about?  Oh, well, they let you guys kind of host the show.  Like, you know, you'd throw it to different things, but you guys were driving.  Because we were so good at TV that we could, hey, we could do it from home.  Wait, what is this?  Opie was behind the wheel, got a little rebellious.  What did he do?  This is so bad. 
[00:30:00]  Come on.  I can't even.  You can do it away.  I don't care.  Okay.  Well, they were driving down the road, and Opie said, hey, you want to see me run this  red light?  And then he pointed the camera up and slowly drove past a red light.  I must have been going at least 10 miles an hour, Ant.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  You're dangerous.  Thank God there was another clip to go to, because then Opie turned to Anthony and said,  oh, my God, is that a cop behind us? 
[00:30:30]  Quick, turn the camera off.  Turn the camera off.  Yeah, and was it shut off?  Yeah, before we saw any police officers.  Oh, look.  No money for extras in the budget?  Extras.  This was on a Spanish-speaking TV station.  So wait, he's driving 10 miles an hour, allegedly through a red light.  He rolls through a red light.  Yeah, of course.  It's a California stop, as they call it.  And he turns the camera off.  Why?  Then what happens?  Well, he said there was a cop.  He looked in the rearview mirror, but the camera did not go to the rearview mirror. 
[00:31:00]  Sure, why wouldn't?  And then noticed that he believed there was a cop hot on his tail.  So he turned the camera off.  Right.  Why?  To avoid the one thing that would have been entertaining?  Which is the police?  Oh, how embarrassing.  Oh, this look back is going to be good.  Fantastic.  One clip a day.  Very excited.  Today you enjoy the Opie chokes on a turkey bit.  How is Ants acting?  Well, you saw it here playing charade.  Believe it or not, he didn't realize. 
[00:31:30]  That was scripted.  So, I mean, Ants acting is very good.  Someone is saying, you can tell Ants acting because he had no idea what to do with his hands.  I knew what to do with my hands.  You grab your neck.  You should have actually squeezed until you choked yourself.  Then there wouldn't have been any more clips to make.  Anthony knew what he was doing.  No, your hands were not in front of you.  You were like, charades!  He's choking now!  Charades!  You know the big...  You know what the big get is going to be? 
[00:32:00]  What?  The tickle me Elmo bit.  I can't find it yet.  Wow.  I've been going through a lot of tapes trying to find it.  You best find that one because what a moment in radio history that was.  Didn't we have Tickle Me Elmo actually driving a car?  Whoa.  Oh, did we do that?  Why?  Because he was tickling.  He probably wouldn't be a very good driver.  Well, I think the camera had to be shut off because a cop was behind him.  Well, I can tell you this much.  The tickle me Elmo, we wanted to kill the tickle me Elmo. 
[00:32:30]  And tickle me Elmo was driving.  And I do believe we tried to take him out in a drive-by.  Oh, no!  That one?  Do you remember that?  And then, you know, in the end, we got him.  The big finale was...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  But I forgot there was a whole story behind...  We couldn't just do the grand finale.  I think we interviewed...  We needed a build-up.  I think we interviewed Tickle Me Elmo, too.  He was sitting on a little couch next to him.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm freezing.  I can't take this. 
[00:33:00]  Because it's...  I'm remembering this.  I love...  I blanked all this out.  People know I love my Twitter.  I haven't checked a reply since that clip went up.  I can't do it to myself.  No one liked Tickle Me Elmo.  You guys killed him.  I remember a little Tickle Me Elmo in the driver's seat as a car passed by.  Whose car was it, by the way?  I think we used yours on that one.  Was it?  Because you had the cool, like, car.  I think you had the...  I had a real guinea mobile.  Yeah.  What did I have? 
[00:33:30]  The, like, freaking cougar.  Yeah.  It was a 1997 cougar.  Black, of course, with the tinted windows because I'm a Dago.  Let me go to the phones.  Oh, God damn.  Let me go to the phones because someone has a fine comment here.  Hello.  I'll be in it for this show.  Mikey.  Opie.  Yeah.  Morning.  Morning.  You guys should call this bitch two douches, one clip. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you can see that clip on Opie Radio on YouTube.  Or everything goes through my Twitter, Opie Radio.  So the links are up there.  Oh, boy, the stars are going down.  I thought I had a five-star video, Sam.  What happened?  What's going on?  Some people not rating it five stars?  Got to keep it five stars.  Come on.  That happened.  You know what?  If it's not a five-star video, then this all goes away.  That's what I do.  Oh, my God.  You can't.  You can't.  See what I do? 
[00:34:30]  See?  No.  If you want to see more douche chill clips, then you better make this five stars.  Whew.  Whew.  Wow, that was tough.  That's tough.  And just remembering some of these, I don't want to see them, but I am compelled.  We're very different in that way, too, because, like, I had a problem.  I'm like, man, Ann's going to hate me because he doesn't like seeing this shit.  No, no, no.  You know what?  I like seeing it for just throwing myself under the bus or us under the bus.  I'll watch it 50 times.  It's just that first time where I'm like, I got to put my hands in front of my face like 
[00:35:00]  I'm watching The Ring again for the first time.  But then after a while, you can just watch the movie over and over.  It's not as scary anymore.  That's how this is.  I haven't seen it yet, but do you remember some kind of bit we did with, like, toy cars  and, like, drunk driving and in the parking lot?  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know.  I forgot why we were doing this.  It must have been a big news story, but we did a whole drunk driving using, like,  Matchbox cars or?  Yeah, little Matchbox cars or something with girls, like, flying out of the vehicle. 
[00:35:30]  I'm like, they let us put this on TV up there?  Who said that was good?  Like, who went, yeah, that's good.  My dream is that.  By the way, our stuff was 20 times better than Rocco's or the morning show's stuff, which  is really saying a lot.  That's what we got to do.  You got to find me one good Rocco bit.  You know what I mean by good.  Yeah.  I was watching Rocco's interview with L7 yesterday. 
[00:36:00]  Was that good?  How was that?  Yeah, yeah.  So, L7, we're here with L7, dude.  We're going, Steve.  We're going to go to the stage with a cigarette because it looked cooler.  Hey, Rocco.  He could barely, like, you know, stop smoking.  Yeah, love that, dude.  Do a stage announcement.  All right, so.  There you go.  Update on what we're doing when we're not doing the radio show.  Yeah, apparently we're doing radio shows and video shows.  Yeah.  Steve was laughing last night.  He goes, it's great how you come home from work to go to work in your basement. 
[00:36:30]  It's like if you're working at a deli, setting up a deli counter in your basement and making  sandwiches.  Well, I'll tell you what this is all about.  Like, they, they, eh, it's a management slam.  But, I mean, nah, I'm not going to say it.  No, no.  It's, you got to keep the fun in.  It is true.  That's all I want to say.  It's a good outlet.  Like, they don't really understand that the suit's totally.  They got to keep the fun.  Yeah.  Like, and they go, oh, what are you talking about? 
[00:37:00]  This place is fun and this is the, no, it's not.  There's too many rules.  We want to do a dumb little bowling bit down this long hallway.  It had to be shut down by 815.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, you got to make sure you keep it fun.  Be able to do whatever you want to do.  So, and, and the internet's a great medium for that, man.  Because you don't have anyone breathing down your neck.  No, you can't post that video.  That's, that's, that's really, really bad.  You shouldn't post that.  Yeah, yeah.  That's awful.  It makes you look silly.  You can't do a 420 show. 
[00:37:30]  That's, no, we got advertisers.  We got to keep it fun.  The one thing Bruce Mittman, we love and hate the guy at the same time.  I think I love him more than hate him now that, now that time has gone by.  Now that I haven't seen him in a while.  Yeah, he, do you remember what he used to say to us every day before he went in to do the show?  Yes, don't get the shwoogies, man.  Well, he did say that.  That's what he used to say every day.  Did say that.  Yes.  Leave the fagulas alone.  Leave the fagulas alone.  He called them fagulas. 
[00:38:00]  But, but, boys, I don't want to have to clean up your messes anymore.  Leave the shwoogies and the fagulas.  Fagulas.  He would say to us every day, just before we went into the studio, go have fun.  Yeah.  And I never forgot that.  Yeah.  Because he was the boss.  He was the guy with the suit on.  And he made sure he told us every chance he got, go have fun.  Yeah.  And that's what's kind of missing in radio in general.  Yeah, it is.  That's why, man, the internet is, it's kind of great as a little hobby, a little fun. 
[00:38:30]  I plan on doing things also, like, once the pool is opened up, which is going to be very  soon.  Outdoor shows.  Party cams.  Dude, you should.  Where the camera's just going to be at the, at the jacuzzi.  Do a show from the jacuzzi.  You should do, like, a spring break from your backyard.  Yes.  Back, backyard, spring break.  Anthony's house.  Oh, man.  Why not?  Live from the compound, as long as it's in the compound.  We could do the bowling bit here again, except use turkeys.  All right, Sam.  Jesus Christ.  Sam is such an instigating tool. 
[00:39:00]  We'll give you leeway.  Trust me.  You're going to go too far and hear the power.  All right, cool.  A couple other things before the break.  I'm just glad you're okay after that, because I was actually nervous.  Yeah.  I love Jim's commentary.  You should do the commentary on these videos.  Oh, yeah.  That could be your thing.  Yes, yes.  You could stop, all right, and have pointers.  The commentary would be great, man.  Jim Norton doing commentary on the old Opie and Anthony TV video clips could be really fun. 
[00:39:30]  And you've got to show it, of course, clean first.  Just show it as it is.  Clean, and then it goes to you.  Now you're on TV.  And then, yeah, you do the commentary on the bit.  Great crossover, too, would be having these clips playing behind me on a little screen.  Jimmy as a guest, and then commenting.  Oh, I would love to.  A little pointer.  Of course, with a little pointer.  Stop the tape.  Hey, just moving on, because we'll...  Literally, stop it and never play it again. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, it's Jimmy's Twitter picture.  Is that the...  What was the comment?  Like some abortion...  Oh, you be the judge, General Chow's chicken or miscarriage.  That was it.  That was what I was eating the other night.  That gave me a laugh when I read that one.  Yeah.  We forgot to do this Friday, because we had a really busy show.  We're here now at the Sirius Building, finally.  It's our second week already.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  And a lot of shows are welcoming us.  Yes.  And others, not so much. 
[00:40:30]  Others, not so much shunning.  Not so much.  It's just that one show shunning, and not the one you think, not the obvious show.  It's the out-cue guys.  They shun us.  They shun us.  Why are they mad at us?  No.  Maybe our reputation precedes us.  Well, we don't even know if...  Oh, fuck those two fatos.  We don't even know if they're mad.  I mean, they're the ones that went by with these looks as they looked in the studio.  And they did.  Stupid us, where you assume they hate us.  But you see how fast I jump on and assume they don't like us? 
[00:41:00]  I assume because Sam actually tried to get them to stop, and they wouldn't even acknowledge  Sam.  Yeah.  Young twink like Sam.  They probably think that we're homophobes in all this.  Just, you know, instead of realizing that we fucking spent an hour arguing with fucking  Bill Donahue.  Yeah.  Your favorite gay marriage.  Gay marriage?  Sure.  We're a big fan of the gay marriage.  Exactly.  I love it.  Maybe we shouldn't say we're a big fan of it.  I am.  You show me a dick, I'll show you a honey.  You show me those two things, I'll show you a smiley face.  Wedded bliss right there.  So today's gay marriage story, a little later, Miss California catches heat for not liking 
[00:41:30]  gay marriage.  Oh.  But who gives a fuck if she likes it?  It's about her.  Exactly.  She should be like Mrs., what was it?  I forgot what state.  The chick who's in Iran and in trouble.  Huh?  North Bomber.  North Bomber Soda?  Yeah.  I was stuttering.  It's like you went to drop one on me and your fucking, your bay doors didn't open.  But no, what was her name? 
[00:42:00]  The woman who's in Iran is a former Miss Something.  Oh, she is?  Yeah, yeah.  She's a former Miss Something.  Yeah.  I was trying to witlessly tie that in.  Witlessly.  That's, okay.  Here's Jay Thomas welcoming us to Sirius.  And then it leads to the big production.  Hold on.  You know what, Garrett?  Garrett, when you go like this, this is painful to listen to because this is one of our old  guys, Stinky, being yelled at by Jay Thomas.  Oh, no.  I'm having a little problem here. 
[00:42:30]  I don't think we've ever yelled at Stinky.  No.  Stinky has always been very attentive to the show, very fun to be around when he was involved  in our program back at NEW days.  And yelling at him would have been like smacking a puppy.  I think I yelled at everyone but Stinky.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, so.  And Stinky's been hanging around a lot since we came to the new building.  I know.  He wants back in.  Hey, hey.  I don't have a problem with that.  Stinky's all right.  Put Steve back up again.  Steve. 
[00:43:00]  Hold on.  What do you mean hold on?  You know what, Garrett?  When you go like this, hold on, it doesn't sound like you're happy to be at your job after  23 minutes.  I can tell you.  I've been here since the morning.  I was on a bigger and better show.  What?  Whoa.  Yeah, Stinky.  All right, Stinky.  We taught him well.  You don't take that shit, Stink.  Nice.  This morning, I was on a bigger and better show.  What show were you on this morning? 
[00:43:30]  I was visiting old friends.  You were at Opie and Anthony?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  You still hung on that group?  I plugged our show, though.  You did?  What did they say?  They said they like you.  They remember you meeting them on air that one time.  Oh, you know what?  They work at Sirius XM now, of course.  Yeah.  Greatest guys in the world.  Are you kidding?  You mean, oh, I thought you said Opie and Anthony.  They're horrible.  Horrible, yeah.  Not to our age. 
[00:44:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Two different guys.  And they're back.  And did they build them a fabulous studio and everything, a beautiful studio?  Eight plasma screen TVs in there.  Yeah, apparently they're going to start trading stocks.  I don't know.  I don't know.  You know what?  You can't laugh in the middle of your jokes, stupid.  Well, I mean, I...  You said they're going to start trading stocks.  They're going to start...  You understood it.  I barely.  Or they're opening a Best Buy.  Okay, this is what I'd like you to do right now.  See, Garrett had a good one.  Sean, I want you to get to the back of my studio.  We're there. 
[00:44:30]  And pace off the length and the width of the Jay Thomas Studios at Sirius XM.  And try not to hit me in the head as I'm sitting in the front of the studio.  Stay where you are, boring.  Jesus, come on.  We have one day of him giving us a compliment.  See, I think when he asked young Garrett what we said about Jay Thomas,  he thought it was going to be a bashing, 
[00:45:00]  and then he was going to go into this bashing tirade, perhaps.  And then when he said that we liked him and remember him from that one appearance on our show,  he changed gears there.  I listened to Jay growing up.  Yeah.  99X for the New Yorkers out there.  Right.  Old school 99X.  That's where he was.  He was my morning show when I was going to high school.  Really?  And I don't even know if it was good anymore.  I've got to be honest.  But I remember at the time I liked what he was doing.  As long as at the time you liked it?  Yeah, I remember it was kind of morning zoo-ish, but it had like an edge. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  If I remember correctly.  Cousin Brucey also had some stuff to say about us last week.  The Beatles with Cassie Brucey.  Love John Paul, George, and Riggle.  We are the Beatles.  Chance, I think, Opie and Anthony went on the air a couple days ago, right?  They have a new studio right now.  But Howard's over.  I'm surrounded with Howard Stern.  Howard on my left side, and on my right side, Opie and Anthony.  I feel like I have bookends.  I feel like a book. 
[00:46:00]  Anyway, Opie and Anthony, you can catch them.  They're really fun.  They're fun characters.  Sirius 197, and on XM 202.  Is that right?  Right?  Right.  Opie and Anthony, and they're on the mornings, right?  Yep.  And they built a great studio.  Why do they have a casting couch in theirs, and I don't have one?  They have couches and televisions.  Yeah, it's different.  We don't know what they do with that.  I can't tell you.  Well, I don't want that information.  I don't want that.  You know, it's different.  It's really wild.  But it's really fun.  So we have, everybody's here.  All right.  I'm going to move for Bobby D.  The Cows. 
[00:46:30]  Bobby Derenkens.  Brucey, live on the five.  Boring.  Oh, come on.  I actually like that song.  Oh, my God.  Oh, he feels like a book.  Yeah, he's got bookends, right, Jimmy?  Yeah, I feel like a book.  They couldn't have put us further away from Howard, by the way.  It needs to be noted.  Oh, I know.  We're on the opposite side of a giant building.  If you look at a square, upper left, upper right. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  Pick the furthest points.  It's exactly that.  Yeah.  It would take us at least 10 minutes to walk to his side of this floor.  Yeah.  Easily.  And then we'd have to go through about five security guys to get to him.  And various doors.  Right.  Like, get smart doors.  Get smart doors.  Yeah.  And Steve and Derek put this together to wrap it up, the whole welcome to Sirius thing.  Oh, nice.  We at the Opie and Anthony Show would like to thank the staff of Sirius XM Satellite Radio 
[00:47:30]  for welcoming us with open arms and open hearts.  Hello, sir.  What's your name?  I've got to do a show.  I've got to go.  Oh, he's got to.  He's shutting the door.  Hello, miss.  What's your name?  I'm late.  That's a strange name.  We know it wasn't easy for you guys to give up so much studio space, but where else were  we going to put all of our 12 flat screen TVs?  Two offices with four TVs and one studio with eight TVs, and Alex Bennett has none, if any 
[00:48:00]  of you know who that is.  We just know that this new arrangement is going to inspire creativity and peaceful harmony  for years to come.  Excuse me, sirs.  What's your name?  He said he was going to shoot me, and then he walked into the studio.  We're the Opie and Anthony Show, and we're all about making friends.  What's the word about Opie and Anthony?  Is it not good?  Yeah, it's not good.  Yeah, I guess that's the vibe we've been getting so far.  And there you go.  That's very cute.  Yeah.  That's little Sam. 
[00:48:30]  Well, we did a fine first hour.  I think we could coast the rest of the morning.  What?  Let's do a coasting show.  Let's just pack it in and go home.  We have, you know, that ugly bra that's an internet sensation from Britain's Got Talent?  Yeah.  Ogre?  Well, huh?  The ogre?  Yes.  Well, a little fucker.  Ogre.  From Revenge of the Nerds.  Oh, God.  She looks like, fuck it, she should be burping really loud in a nerd's face.  Wait, I gotta see that now.  Well, yeah. 
[00:49:00]  I think I'm out of this one.  Oh, dude, Ogre from Revenge of the Nerds?  Yeah.  The guy, the big huge guy.  Oh, you remember him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was thinking, yeah, sure.  He's the bad guy in every 80s, early 80s movie.  Yeah, of course.  Guy rules.  God, what is he still doing?  I don't know.  Wow, that'd be...  Revenge of the Nerds movies.  Yeah, Revenge of the Nerds movies still, huh?  You don't, they never stop making those movies.  Oh, yeah, direct-to-video.  We just stop watching them.  Is he still doing them, Danny?  I think he's been in a few of the sequels.  That guy's great.  How many have they made?  I'm gonna guess, because I think a lot of them went right to Blockbuster, which is no 
[00:49:30]  longer, or right to Netflix, or whatever.  I'm gonna go with eight Revenge of the Nerds movies.  You're kidding.  How many victories do the nerds need?  I'm gonna go with eight movies made.  I bet the bad, tough guys try to undermine them in some way, and then the nerds are able  to defeat them through their nerdness again and again and again.  Rattle them off, Danny. 
[00:50:00]  Well, you got the original Revenge of the Nerds, 1984, and then you have Revenge of the  Nerds 2, Nerds in Paradise.  What about the Revenge of the Nerds 1991 TV show?  Well, there, yeah, well, there you go, right there.  That was 91.  Then you got Revenge of the Nerds 3, The Next Generation.  Yep.  And who could forget Revenge of the Nerds 4, Nerds in Love?  So there's five of them.  Oh, God.  If you count the TV.  Yuck.  Wait, Revenge of the...  All right.  That's it.  Why?  That's it for this series.  Why?  I, um...  Hey, I gotta give props to a movie I saw that Jimmy saw. 
[00:50:30]  Uh...  Why would you give a propeller to...  Not those kind of props.  Oh, thanks.  What was the movie's...  Observe and Report.  Observe and Report.  I saw it yesterday afternoon.  I actually went to a movie theater, because I'm not fortunate enough to have a movie theater  in my home like Anthony, because I live in New York City.  You should hear the things I scream out, by the way, in that movie theater.  I can imagine.  When guests are over.  I scream out things that would be impossible to scream out in real movie theaters.  Or on satellite radio, or...  And it's hysterically funny to everyone in the theater, because you feel like you're in a theater. 
[00:51:00]  And the movie's playing, the lights are dimmed, and then out of nowhere, just a screaming  word will come blaring out, and everyone lofts and lofts.  When am I gonna get, uh, the big invite to the movie theater?  You're cordially invited.  Yeah, but that's...  This weekend.  I believe Saturday, Laszlo's coming over.  Danny, what are you doing?  Ooh.  Coming over.  All right, coming over.  You know what?  Uh, Travis?  Anybody?  Jimmy?  Everyone?  I'm busy!  Party at my house on Saturday. 
[00:51:30]  You know what?  I have a wedding.  Saturday.  Oh.  I could slip out of that.  No, I'm hoping...  I gotta do a Bobby Kelly show on Saturday.  Oh, you're out?  God, screw Bobby Kelly.  You're so gonna...  Let's do it Friday night instead!  I even dress for party.  Party at my house Friday and Saturday night!  Oh my God!  That's great.  Two nights!  I'm thinking, though, Saturday's good for me, because then I might be in your world.  Because, you know, weddings, you drink a little more than usual, and I might be in 
[00:52:00]  a nice state for you.  A nice frame of mind, a nice state, a little intoxicated, and maybe we could do a little  broadcast.  I don't want to do that.  That'd be nice, the Opie and Anthony show.  No, no, I don't do that.  I think we'd be a hit.  No, I'm...  Imagine.  That would never work.  Yeah, that would never work.  You know why that's not gonna work, because I would turn into a stupid producer guy for  your dumb show.  It's like, why are you touching my board?  Yeah.  Why are you playing clips?  No, you gotta set that up before you... 
[00:52:30]  You can't just do it.  No, I'm just gonna do it.  No!  I don't like the green screen you picked out.  Maybe I could just go there and hang out and not have to worry about anything.  Steve would just come in scrolling for no reason.  Actually, when I did Brewer Show, I just hung out.  So maybe I could just hang out.  That's it.  That would be cool.  Watch a movie.  Do a little broadcast.  Drink a little bit.  It's not my responsibility.  I don't care.  I'm just gonna sit here.  That's what it is.  It's a free ride.  I like that.  I don't even consider it my responsibility, which makes it even better. 
[00:53:00]  You just flip things...  You flip all the power switches on, and before you know it, you're broadcasting.  But what is that movie again?  Observe and Report.  Seth Rogen and Ray Liotta.  We had Ray Liotta in.  Yeah, the movie was all right.  It's a different type of comedy.  I had some big laughs in that one.  Some big laughs, right?  It was all right.  No one was even better than the movie, though.  They have a movie coming out.  I was telling Ant.  Some kind of, like, bachelor party goes to Vegas.  Looks like the movie has potential.  I'll say that much. 
[00:53:30]  But Mike Tyson makes a cameo.  You've got to see the preview.  I'm sure it's online.  Of Mike Tyson.  Mike Tyson's cameo in this movie.  You know In the Air Tonight, Phil Collins' song, where everyone goes,  Oh, I love the drumming part, and then everyone waits for it.  Like, wait, wait, this is my favorite part.  They always screw up by doing it too early because they think it's in the first one, but it's not.  I think there's a million...  There's literally a million people out there that have done that exact bit.  Like, wait, wait, this is my favorite part of the song.  Do-do-do-do-do-do. 
[00:54:00]  And Mike Tyson does it as a cameo in this movie coming out in the summer.  The theater lost it.  Yeah.  I haven't had a laugh that hard in a long effing time.  Long time.  Yeah, that's a...  Maybe he's got a new career in movies.  Well, I don't know about that.  Cameos in movies.  I mean, a cameo is good enough, right?  A new career in rape.  But the other thing, too, is that we've discussed this.  They're giving away the entire movie now in these previews. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, they've been doing this for a long time, man.  I don't even like watching previews because they do.  They give away key element plots that are supposed to be surprises.  Right.  Like, by the time you're done watching the trailer, you've seen these plot twists that  ruin the movie for you.  Because you're watching the beginning now in the theater going, oh, I know that guy's  bad.  Yeah.  And meanwhile, at the beginning, he's not bad.  Well, they showed a preview for an Adam Sandler movie coming out where he's a comic. 
[00:55:00]  And he has Seth Rogen writing for him.  And then...  And I'm not giving this away because you're all going to see the same preview.  Then you learn that Adam Sandler's sick and going to die.  No.  But then you learn that he's not going to die anymore.  All in the preview.  I wish it was called the Rich Voss story.  Except for the best laugh part.  He's going to be okay.  See, that's exactly what I'm talking about, though.  That's a prime example.  I don't know how the movie's going to end, but I know that he's a comic.  I know he befriends Seth Rogen. 
[00:55:30]  I know Seth Rogen writes for him, which makes him a bigger star.  Next thing you know, they have a friendship, but now Adam Sandler is sick with something.  He's going to die.  Then they go through all the emotional, ting, ting, ting, ting, ting, type music.  And then fast forward in the preview, the doctor gives him a clean bill of health.  I haven't even seen the movie yet.  Ruins the plot line.  That's three quarters of the movie easily, right?  Aren't you supposed to be thinking that he's dying when you think he's dying?  Yes.  And now you don't.  Yeah, so fuck Adam Sandler for approving that preview, you dummy. 
[00:56:00]  They, uh...  God, I can't stand it.  It happened last night.  There it is.  Congratulations, dude.  You got married.  This is the Vegas, uh...  He's wearing my grandmother's Holocaust ring.  The Tyson thing is really late in this, by the way.  I think it's pretty much the last laugh.  These gentlemen volunteered to demonstrate...  Yeah, this is going to take forever.  It's, uh, the guys that did Old School.  God, jeez, would he tase him in the face?  Yeah, right between the eyes.  That's pretty good.  Basically, they go to Vegas and they get so drunk they don't remember that they got married, 
[00:56:30]  found a kid, all sorts of crazy stuff.  If only they could remember.  Yeah, that's not going to happen.  And if one more movie does the Rain Man scene, I'm going to puke.  They just showed the Rain Man scene going down the escalator because they're in Vegas.  I can't tell you...  Oh, here's Tyson.  This is my favorite part coming up right now.  Oh!  I forgot it.  You will come in the air tonight. 
[00:57:00]  That is pretty funny.  But Tyson sings along.  He smashes him in the face.  Oh, that was the last drama.  That's good.  Worst preview ever, Cast Away.  Oh, yes!  Why?  Dude, they gave away the whole fucking part of the movie.  That he gets rescued.  Let me go to the phones here.  Hello!  I'll be an Anthony show.  Ben?  Hey, guys.  Hey, ma'am.  Hey.  Hey, yeah, Cast Away.  They show it halfway through the trailer. 
[00:57:30]  They show him sitting there with that stupid Wilson, the volleyball, floating around in the ocean,  looking at a humpback whale, thinking he's going to screw it or something.  They also show him back in civilization.  And you're like, what the fuck?  You gave away that he actually makes it off the island.  Mm-hmm.  Yep.  They're terrible.  Well, what's the...  Somebody told me that you could...  Online or something, they could tell you exactly when the movie starts. 
[00:58:00]  Because we all see like 8.15, you know, the movie starts at 8.15.  And we all panic, like we've got to get there by 8.15.  But obviously, you've got a solid 15 minutes before the movie starts.  But the problem there is you don't get a good seat if it's a popular movie.  Yeah.  So you're kind of fucked.  You've got to sit through the previews.  And then you sit through these previews where they're giving away the entire movie on you.  Yeah, you've got to sit through the previews.  See, there he is.  He kind of...  Oh, you see him on the plane.  They show him on the plane.  They show him getting back.  It's so goddamn ridiculous. 
[00:58:30]  When I'm getting on demand...  Yeah, there it is.  When I'm getting an on demand at home and I'm not sure if I want to watch it,  I'll put on the preview for five seconds just to make sure I don't see like Jean-Claude Van Damme in it or something.  And then if it looks cool for five seconds, click it off and watch the movie.  Dude, the fucking Sixth Sense preview was horrible.  Was it, Jim?  Yeah, because they start showing that there's a boy looking for ghosts.  And then they show that Bruce Willis is dead. 
[00:59:00]  And I'm like, that's silly.  He is?  Yeah.  He was dead the whole movie?  Dead the whole movie.  But they show that in the preview.  Oh, they did.  Yeah.  Now that really would have sucked.  That would have been awful.  That joke did, though.  Yeah.  Wow.  I needed a preview for that one.  Note not to go hear it.  Here's the preview for that that you show on the screen.  A man with a nose with his two fingers over it making a PU gesture.  And just the graphic PU comes out of nowhere. 
[00:59:30]  The Negro.  Really?  I was supposed to say I was only joking.  Well, it didn't.  Our buttons are all messed up, for real.  We got to, like, redo our instant replay.  Oh, when we come...  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Okay, terrific.  When we come back from break, I have special audio.  Oh, that's right.  Oh!  I can't wait.  Yeah, it's way better than the first hour we just did.  Yes.  Chris, what do you got? 
[01:00:00]  Hey, even in Pineapple Express, they ruined the ending.  They show Seth Rogen, Carrie, and James Franco out of the fire.  I mean, it's not that big a deal because the movie's just a stoner comedy, but they still  ruined it.  Can I add...  Oh, go ahead.  Sorry, Chris.  Go.  Oh, that was it.  I mean, they just...  And they even showed him jumping on that villain guy.  They just showed the whole other movie in the Red Band trailer, that is.  Chris, let me ask you something.  Did you like Pineapple Express?  I liked it, for the most part.  I think I have to sit through it again, because I don't think I was in the right space to 
[01:00:30]  watch the movie, because I kept tuning out.  Yeah.  Because there was way too much action or something.  I guess...  I think...  I didn't realize that it was an action movie?  Action movie slash comedy?  I didn't know that.  So I wasn't prepared for all that action, and I think it just made me tune out?  I don't know.  I gotta see it again.  You see it?  No, I haven't seen that one.  I've not seen that one yet.  Okay.  I was just going to comment on another movie that was ruined by the trailer.  Valkyrie.  You find out Hitler didn't die. 
[01:01:00]  Did you just ruin that for me?  The assassination attempt.  You ruined it?  Yeah.  Well...  Are you going to see the Brad Pitt one, by the way?  They had that preview.  What?  Benjamin Buttons?  No, no.  I haven't seen that one.  No, the Nazi one he's doing.  Oh, he's doing a Nazi one?  Yeah, it's getting a lot of hype.  I see every Nazi movie.  It's coming out in the summer.  I don't know the name of it, but he needs eight soldiers, and they're going to kill Nazis.  Oh, that's the one, Quentin Tarantino.  Oh, that's right.  Quentin's a magnificent bastard. 
[01:01:30]  That motherfucker better...  Glorious.  Glorious bastard.  That's it.  That motherfucker better come in to promote that movie.  Yeah.  We did Grindhouse.  He came in for Grindhouse.  Yeah.  Knowing that movie needed a little help, although I enjoyed that whole thing.  But he better come in to promote that one.  Yeah, that looks good.  That's, um...  Yeah, that's...  They showed a...  Blood and guts.  In the preview, they showed a guy that got the Nazi...  The swastika?  Yeah.  Branded right where, like, Manson had his? 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, it's a group of guys, and their job is to go and treat Nazis as poorly as they were  treating other people.  So, uh...  In order to, uh...  Kind of destroy morale.  Preview looks good.  So they go in and just...  Uh...  It's so violent.  Is it fiction?  It's so Tarantino.  Um, I...  I think.  I'm not sure.  Is it based on true people, though?  I don't know.  I mean, the Nazis, obviously.  Is it based on true people?  No.  Tarantino's not shy when it comes to blood and guts.  Yeah, yeah.  Kind of likes that.  Those Kill Bill movies are...  Oh, they get better. 
[01:02:30]  You know, I hated them when I first saw...  They get...  That's what I said.  They get better the more you watch them.  And now I just love, uh, watching them.  They're so, like, violent.  Do you allow smoking in your theater?  No smoking.  There's no smoking in my theater.  No, it's got that new theater smell to it.  It's wonderful.  What about farting?  Uh, well, I can't stop that, but, um...  Nice.  The ventilation system's good.  Yeah.  You gotta have that.  But, uh, no smoking.  No smoking.  The seats recline all the way back.  It's nice. 
[01:03:00]  I sat in it, dude.  It's fucking...  The chairs are so big and cushy, and you have a big little thing for your cup.  Yes, little cup holders.  A sippy cup.  It's really cool.  It's so...  It's wonderful.  Ziggy DC.  I put on an Afro leg just so I didn't think it'd throw me out.  It's not allowed here.  Ziggy.  Hey, morning, boys.  Morning.  Come back to DC.  We met you.  Thank you.  Um, you can tell that Vegas movie's gonna stink, because they're hyping a cameo from  somebody.  Like, Wedding Crashers didn't hype the Will Ferrell cameo, and, uh, Tropic Thunder didn't 
[01:03:30]  hype the Tom Cruise thing, so...  Don't forget, they also probably had bigger...  They probably had bigger names in it starring than the Vegas one does.  Like, did the Vegas have big names starring in it?  I think they couldn't...  I think they couldn't help themselves, because the Tyson clip is really effing funny.  Doesn't it suck, though, when you see that so many times in a trailer, and then  it comes up in the movie, and you're just like, eh, well...  Saw it already.  Saw it a hundred times.  Been there, done that.  Meh, meh, meh.  Old hat.  Yes.  Did you see the, um, the preview for the new Borat movie? 
[01:04:00]  I call it the new Borat movie.  Yeah, just call it.  That's...  Everyone knows what you mean.  Did you see the preview, Danny?  That's it.  That's, uh...  I think I saw one.  I'm not sure which one I saw, but I know I saw at least one of the versions of it.  There's some big laughs in that fucking preview.  Yeah, it's gonna...  What's the name of the movie again?  Bruno?  Well, if you want the full title.  Of course.  He can't just have short titles for his movies.  I did not like the trailer.  No?  I'm not trying to be Mr. Different, because I love, uh...  You are being Mr. Different.  No, I think he's brilliant, but I just didn't like the trailer.  You weren't a big fan of Borat either, were you?  Not at all. 
[01:04:30]  I love Borat.  But I didn't see the TV show.  I'm one of those guys...  You never saw the show?  I never saw the HBO show.  Can I get that on the...  Can I get that?  Yes.  Dude, the show is all unsuspecting people.  There's no plot line to it.  It's all unsuspecting people.  Yeah, you didn't need a storyline.  So what happens is, in this one, in the movie, there's some unsuspecting people, and some  that are in on it, and the script, like the black girl's a comedian.  Oh, you know, she did the pilot.  She's not...  So it's like, there was that mix.  There was no mix in the original.  It was purely civilians.  Yeah.  I gotta... 
[01:05:00]  Someone bring that in for me.  Who's got it?  I don't feel like buying it.  Because I don't know where to buy stuff anymore.  Send someone else for it.  It's good.  It's great.  Here are back-to-back comments.  Jimmy, get over yourself.  Jimmy is right on.  Jimmy, get over myself?  Yes.  Why?  I just didn't like something?  I'm not saying that he skits.  Get over yourself.  I think he's very funny.  You know what?  Maybe it was good that I didn't see the TV show, because Borat, to me, is a great movie.  Not even just a good one.  I love that fucking thing.  It is a good film.  And then if you see some of the skits from the Ali G show, I mean, it's ten times better. 
[01:05:30]  I mean, it's so good.  So if you haven't seen it, it's just going to make the character even better.  I'm all about Ali G.  By the way, the Bruno full title is Bruno, Delicious Journeys Through America for the  Purpose of Making Heterosexual Males Visibly Uncomfortable in the Presence of a Gay Fawner  in a Mesh T-Shirt.  That's the title?  Fucking guy.  How long?  He better come in to promote this, too.  He promoted Borat.  The Borat title is really long, too.  Yeah.  Well, and you know he'll come in character also and never break. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  Can we get blowjobs from him, then, if he's gay?  Hey, hey, don't break character.  Suck my dick.  That should be the bit.  We should see how far he goes.  Someone should take one for the team and go, all right, if you're going to be in character,  see how far...  As Steve comes busting in, okay, I'll do it.  How far do you think he would go if he's in character?  He'd kiss you.  He'd kiss you.  He'd probably make you uncomfortable by starting to kiss you first.  He stuck his cock in a fat man's face. 
[01:06:30]  He had a fat man's ass and balls right on his face.  it's horrible  one of the funniest scenes in the Borat movie  was when  he's at that table though  having dinner  with that family  and he's talking about taking a shit  where is the shithole  and he tells the one woman  that she's attractive you not so much  those are real people though  that scene to me was the best 
[01:07:00]  well you could tell which weren't the real people  yeah which was staged  he was really offending certain people  you've never seen  you've never seen the Borat  you had to have seen it  I saw a little Ali G when it was on  very little  he's singing in the fucking country western bar  I don't even want to say the name of the song  but about  but I hope he doesn't remember  maybe he didn't tie it in  we played it on our show  it's great dude 
[01:07:30]  it's really funny  the original show  the Ali G is a funny character  the movie Ali G was not good  but the fucking character  they did an Ali G movie  that was the first one he did  it was like a pure movie movie  it wasn't like a character  it was a scripted  speaking of songs  that just reminded me  last night  we pulled up  a song  we were talking about  the most offensive song contest  so we went looking for a few things  since Steve from Bayshore  we played his  Viva Das Auschwitz song 
[01:08:00]  but then  we played  the KKK song  I could not believe  that went on regular radio  oh I know  it  every word of that song  is so offensive  it could not possibly  even be played on satellite radio  it could not be played  on the internet  under your name  without getting in trouble  it is so  purely  offensive 
[01:08:30]  please tell me  you turned off the camera  had no audio  for 30 seconds before  after you playing that  dude  I didn't play it on the show  oh you didn't  no way  this was upstairs  during like dinner  you played on this show  there's no way  it could be played anywhere  we didn't get one complaint  it is so offensive  no why we didn't get a complaint  because we set it up  as the most offensive song  absolutely  one of the greatest bits  we ever did  that flew under the radar  you gotta remind me  I got the KKK letter  that I found too  in my boxes  there are certain things 
[01:09:00]  that you cannot  ever get away with anymore  in this climate  and that is one of them  wow  wah wah wah wah wah  wah wah wah  tree  da da da da da da da da da da da da  the KKK can  I mean  oh  AIDS infected  wah wah  it is so bad  if someone reminds me  I will bring in  the KKK letter  that was sent to us  when we were at  up in Boston  let's do that one  and in the letter 
[01:09:30]  it says  keep up the good job  yeah yeah  like we're doing a good job  yeah  I'll bring that in tomorrow  wonderful  alright we'll take a break  you got something fun  for the break  you got the Borat song  alright we'll do this  and  oh Jimmy's got some  fine audio  from his crib  after the break  over here Anthony  this is a song called  Mogus Robic  Domovon  it's been  in my country  there is a problem  in my country

[01:14:30]  There's nothing worse than that.  Is that great?  There's nothing worse than that.  Oh, my asshole was dry heaving.  That was terrible.  You know, it's really amazing how you can even hold that in at all.  I know.  Like, you're watertight down there.  Who knew?  I was out to dinner at somebody's house, and I had to start shitting.  And the last half hour they were talking, all I'm thinking about is I don't want to do this in their toilet. 
[01:15:00]  Wow.  Because I'm going to wind up spraying the underside of the seat, the fucking light fixtures.  A little splash back.  Yeah, it didn't burn, though, because I was using wet naps.  And it wasn't like a diarrhea shit.  This was my system being cleaned out.  Yes.  So I was eating fucking, I was just, I would shit, right?  And then I would stand up and put one foot on the ball and take a wet nap and just dab from the back of my fucking balls and just wipe in a circle the whole area of my thighs and my ass cheeks. 
[01:15:30]  I took a picture taking a towel and going, sugar, sugar, sugar, between your legs to dry off.  Jesus.  Yeah, then I would, there was a towel on the floor, a cum towel, and I would just dab my fucking cheeks dry with that.  You could tell you're going to be there a while when you don't feel any friction during the cleaning procedure.  When you don't feel any friction, when it's just like, swish, you're like, okay, that's not gone.  Dude, there's a world of hurt.  Yeah, but such a weird coffee, it looked like, it was the color of the paper, it looked like I had rubbed it in like day-old coffee. 
[01:16:00]  It was like a black, awful sludge color.  What is up with that?  I don't know.  What is that?  That's the shit that was stuck on the wall, supposedly.  Possibly, yeah.  I hope so.  I didn't take them last night.  I don't know what I believe with that stuff.  I didn't take them last night because I knew today I had to go to the bank.  I'm like, I can't stiff leg down fucking 6th Avenue.  Stiff leg.  I know we had Brie Olsen coming in and fucking Sunset Thomas. 
[01:16:30]  They do that walk.  Yeah, I didn't want to stiff leg to the bank.  So I'm like, I'll fucking just, you know.  Yeah.  You ever have a dump where it just slides out and you look behind you and you're just amazed at how much?  Because you're like, I wasn't feeling this.  Yeah, it's an unexpected treat.  It just slides out like a boa constrictor going into the pond. 
[01:17:00]  Miss California catches heat for not liking gay marriage.  This is a biggie today.  Your question comes from judge number 8, Perez Hilton.  Are we worried?  Perez Hilton?  Was a judge for the Miss California contest?  That guy is good.  He stinks.  Oh, no.  He gets to the bottom of it.  God, does he stink.  What the hell?  Who's a Perez Hilton fan?  I am. 
[01:17:30]  No one's hands up.  Oh, Jimmy's hand is up.  You can't even fake it.  This guy stinks.  What would Tyler Durden do way better than Perez's dump site?  W-W-T-D-D dot com.  Is this the contest itself?  I don't know, Anthony.  Like, I don't know what clip we're hearing.  Are we hearing a clip from the contest?  Supposedly from the actual, yeah, Miss California contest.  Oh, so she's being asked the question.  Yeah.  Did she end up being crowned, Miss California? 
[01:18:00]  I don't know.  Let's find out.  All right.  Your question comes from judge number 8, Perez Hilton.  Are we worried?  You should be.  Vermont recently became the fourth state to legalize same-sex marriage.  Do you think every state should follow suit?  Why or why not?  Well, I think it's great that Americans are able to choose one or the other.  We live in a land that you can choose same-sex marriage or opposite marriage. 
[01:18:30]  And you know what?  In my country and in my family, I think that I believe that a marriage should be between  a man and a woman.  No offense to anybody out there, but that's how I was raised, and that's how I think that  it should be between a man and a woman.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Now, I guess I'm for gay marriage, but what's wrong with her saying that?  Nothing is wrong with her saying that.  No, there was nothing wrong with that.  She's Miss California running for Miss USA.  This was a Miss USA contest. 
[01:19:00]  She's Miss California.  And that was her opinion.  I thought she was going to really, she was digging in.  That's like, that's an opinion of maybe the majority of this country still.  He asked her and she answered.  When old Perez Hilton gave the question, it seemed like 10% of the population of the audience  applauded.  Yeah.  And when she gave hers, it got a little more applause.  So, I have, I have.  How important is the cock?  I'm just watching Larry King talking to Perez Hilton. 
[01:19:30]  What?  Why is he interviewing that fucking worthless fucking blogger?  Which is what he is.  Yeah.  He's huge for, wow, holy shit.  Wow, wee.  Is that her?  Yeah.  Fuck a duck.  God.  Look at the legs on this bitch.  Give me a break.  You know what?  Fuck gay marriage.  I'm for whatever this girl's for.  Whatever she wants.  Look at how they make these girls dance and shit.  Wow.  And little bikinis and skirts.  What was this on? 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Well, how did we miss this?  I'm always tuning around going, there's nothing on.  I got to watch Aliens again.  Why wasn't I watching this?  Holy shit.  How did they get this, Danny?  You got to help the audience.  Look at that fucking ass.  Well, you can just.  These white bikinis, they have all the contestants wearing.  You can just point your browser over to that terrific site that I go to on a daily basis.  PerezHilton.com. 
[01:20:30]  Prominently hosted on the very tippity top of this page.  Did she wind up winning?  No.  Who won?  She was, I think, Miss North Carolina.  Punch up Miss North Carolina.  She better be the hottest fucking thing.  They're saying that that question cost her the competition.  No shit.  Why, though?  She's a babe.  That's bullshit.  Ah, political correct judge bullshit.  The audience was applauding.  If PerezHilton is a judge, the audience don't vote.  She was nice, though.  PerezHilton fucking votes.  And he probably gave her a zero score because something tells me he's a little effeminate. 
[01:21:00]  And they started attacking her on his blog.  Of course he did.  Of course.  That's the one that won?  He's real brave.  He asked her a question.  Yeah, let's get a body shot of that, bitch.  She nicely gave her opinion.  She didn't say anything nasty about gay people.  She gave her opinion after it was asked.  It's like, I don't even agree with her, but you can't shit on her for that.  I thought she was going to say something that was outrageous or edgy.  Yeah.  Like I said earlier, it's an opinion that a lot of people believe in. 
[01:21:30]  I like the California chick better than this one.  Yeah.  What was her question?  What easy fucking softball question they throw her?  Yeah, that's a good question.  It's about, I don't know, the world being starving or hungry.  Global warming.  Yeah, world hunger.  How would you fix it?  Well, I think we ought to get more money to world hunger.  Shut up.  Shut your ass, dummies.  Open your ass.  Shut your mouth.  Right.  Men should dip their penises in honey and feed other men.  I agree. 
[01:22:00]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Blah, swallow, blah, swallow.  Good news, everyone.  We've got Perez Hilton on Larry King, so this is going to be terrific.  Oh, great.  How important is...  Let's hear how irrelevant Larry is.  Perez on Larry King.  This is Sam's writing, which I'm a big fan of.  Larry gets to the bottom of what's going on through a series of hard-hitting questions.  Yeah, hard-hitting.  That means there's not one hard-hitting question, right, Sam?  No, that's incorrect. 
[01:22:30]  It speaks for itself.  All righty.  We welcome Perez Hilton.  Is it fair to bring...  Why did you bring this into effect?  Why did you bring this into the pageant?  I don't know.  Because it's the top news story every day, Larry.  No, he means Perez's godless lifestyle.  Well, I was given the opportunity on this national platform to ask a question that I thought was relevant.  What about you, you fucking asshole?  It's about hot babes marching around in their bathing suits and not to bring your fucking agenda to a stupid girly contest. 
[01:23:00]  What an idiot this guy is.  And why is he...  Fuck him.  Why is he judging a girly contest?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He knows nothing about girlies.  We know about girlies.  Yeah.  Exactly.  That California girl should have won.  And I haven't seen the other 49.  50 other ones, if they include Puerto Rico.  Are they still including that in Miss USA?  Well, Ann, I got good news for you. 
[01:23:30]  Luke in Buffalo.  Luke.  Luke.  Hey, Luke.  Luke.  Luke.  Luke.  Hey, Luke.  How are you?  Luke.  Luke.  Not bad.  I just wanted to tell you guys.  Luke.  What's up, Luke?  It's freaking gorgeous.  It's delicious.  You got to check it out on NBC.com.  Oh, yeah?  Wait, so what's up on NBC.com?  You can watch the whole swimsuit competition if you want.  The preliminary or whatever they got.  Whoa.  And Luke says Miss Vermont is the hottest. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, yeah?  So we're going to take a look at Miss Vermont.  Thank you, Luke.  She was in the top five, but, you know.  All right.  Thank you.  Back to Larry King.  A question that I thought was relevant.  And given the recent setbacks and advances that we've made in the fight for gay marriage,  I thought it was a very important question for me specifically to ask.  Was she like a finalist?  Were they down to like three?  It was down to the top five.  And she was definitely either the front runner or one of the top two contenders.  She wound up what?  Runner up?  Runner up. 
[01:24:30]  Did you think that it hurt her?  Absolutely.  And I think a lot of the judges did.  Go fuck yourself, Chris Hilton.  I can't stand this fucking guy.  I don't mind him asking her that.  Oh, stop.  I don't mind a guy asking a question that he thinks is socially relevant.  But I don't like him attacking on the blog because he's such a snotty little bitch.  Dude, it's his agenda that he used to undermine this fucking girl, and it worked.  If he's the judge and he doesn't personally like the fucking answer, it's not if you personally like the answer. 
[01:25:00]  It's how you feel she answered the question.  You're not supposed to judge.  I don't know how they fucking judge it.  God damn it, you're making a great point.  But it's not based on if you like her answer or not.  It's how well she answered it.  And how she presents herself.  Right, and she did it well.  Because I've seen some of these morons really trip over their tits, over these questions.  So if he's a judge, you're right.  She didn't answer it the way he wanted it answered.  So now next thing you know, she loses the competition.  She handled that question very well.  What a tool. 
[01:25:30]  God, was she hot.  I think that's why I'm so upset.  Riding the shitter, right?  Yeah, oh fuck.  Tongue first.  Little car wash.  Dive right in there.  Car wash.  I would do the car wash.  Fuck that exhaust pipe wash.  Fuck the rest of the car.  Right up the old tailpipe.  That's where I'm going.  Spend some time there.  Perez says Miss USA shouldn't be politically correct.  Yeah.  What?  What?  Is right. 
[01:26:00]  Perez says.  Did I mistype that should be?  Oh, should be politically correct?  Says Miss USA should be politically correct.  That's what a.  Okay.  That's what a douchebag.  After she was done, during the commercial break, I could tell by the look in her face  that she knew she had lost because of that answer.  Because it was a bad answer.  Why is it bad if it was honest?  Honest.  Hey, Larry.  You know, Larry actually.  Hey, Larry.  Larry actually woke up.  Larry woke up for this fucking interview.  Larry went, I think it's 1988 again. 
[01:26:30]  I feel like I could ask a pertinent question.  Damn, Larry.  Now I know why you're on CNN.  It's like this guy wanted to undermine this fucking girl.  And he's proud of the fact that his fucking agenda, literally his fucking agenda, brought  this girl down.  What's the matter?  Too pretty?  Was she too pretty for you?  You don't like pretty girls because good looking guys like pretty girls?  You fuck?  Ugh.  I do hate this guy.  Yes.  I hate him.  Yeah.  He's a douchebag.  You know, I have one gay couple that I'm friends with. 
[01:27:00]  Boo!  Boo.  They were at the wedding, actually.  Really?  And not every gay couple believes in the gay marriage.  One of the two says, what's the big fucking deal?  I don't give a shit.  And says they get everything they need without being married.  Sounds like what a lot of straight couples think, too.  You ask one of them and they're like, I don't fucking care.  I don't want to get married.  Right.  And the other one's like, well, maybe I would.  So it's not even about like, you know, every gay couple out there going, rah, rah, we need 
[01:27:30]  to be married.  This particular couple that I am friends with, I have no problem admitting it, they think  it's horse shit.  Your life's like a sitcom.  Yeah.  You've got all the characters.  I know.  Now that I'm pushing for you, I'm like, all right, I'll have an open mind and have gay  friends.  Wow.  Right.  But that's it, though.  That's it.  That's my quota.  You're done.  You're full up.  It's fine until, you know, they snuggle on the couch to watch a movie with me and my 
[01:28:00]  girl.  They feel comfortable enough yet where they're showing public displays of affection in front  of you?  Well, we were invited.  Let's finish the clip.  We were invited up to their mountain house for a sleepover.  Wow.  And the ride up.  You were invited.  Yes.  Probably.  That nasty wife of yours.  No, they, she could just drop you off.  She could. 
[01:28:30]  They actually, why is your brother on TV?  You got to see his face.  My brother almost looks black.  That's a black version of brother Joe.  That's Joe.  That's Joe with a fan.  I'll say this much.  So, you know, I was kind of uncomfortable to go up there for the night and stuff and did  dinner, drinking wine in the back.  All that stuff was fine.  I had no problem with any of it.  Uh-oh.  And you find your line.  And it was when, I don't even remember what movie it was. 
[01:29:00]  When the one, like, leaned back into the other, that's when I went, oh.  That was it for me.  That was so hard to take as a guy, right?  That was it for me.  Yeah.  I mean, they didn't do any hand-holding or any kissing.  You could tell.  Just a little.  But you could tell they really love each other, right?  Something you'd never do with one of your friends.  No.  And then we settled in to watch a movie and the one guy's sitting there and the other  guy kind of, like, you know, leaned back into the other guy's chest.  I'm like, all right, this is it. 
[01:29:30]  That's my line.  This is where it gets uncomfortable for me.  Oh, yeah.  Everything else was fine, though.  I was fine with it.  Yeah.  Wow, that is, yeah.  But, too?  What?  No, no, no.  Oh, sorry.  I shouldn't say but in this conversation.  Sorry.  But they're not fans of the gay marriage.  No.  And I was surprised by that.  I'm like, I would just assume every gay couple would be like, yes, let's, you know, we have  to support this.  They're like, fuck that. 
[01:30:00]  I don't know.  We get benefits, and if I'm sick, he can come to the hospital and all that crap, and  we got insurance and regular sick.  Yeah.  It is fun, though.  I saw your face.  Jesus.  Can we have a mature discussion for 30 seconds?  Good luck with that.  I know.  I know a couple gay comedians, and it is fun, like, playing would you with them, like,  about certain guys.  Like, if a waiter comes over, I'm like, would you fuck them?  Really?  Yeah, it's fun, because I don't know exactly what they look for. 
[01:30:30]  What they're, yeah, well, yeah.  And, uh...  What about...  Did you ever ask about yourself?  No, um...  No, I know...  You figured them sucking your dick was enough of an answer?  No, I know one's into Asians, so he wouldn't.  Yeah.  And the one who helped me decorate my apartment, uh, he fucks chicks, too, I think, but he's  more into guys.  Uh, I don't think he would.  Don't go mucking up the fucking, uh...  What's weird in my...  ...selection we got.  What's weird in my case, I don't even look at them like they're looking at me... 
[01:31:00]  Not at all.  ...in a weird way, or...  I don't think any of that.  They're just...  They're just...  They're two guys that are pretty cool in my world.  His fucking...  I don't get...  I mean, the...  The leaning back was very uncomfortable, I have to admit that, but...  When I'm hanging out with them, I'm...  I'm like...  I don't think that they're checking me out at all.  If they are, they are.  They probably are.  My friend's boyfriend was an 11.  Like, I know...  Even if I wanted to fuck him, I had no shot.  It was almost like...  It was so...  The guy he was banging, it was like...  It was like a guy with a fucking magazine cover, so it's like... 
[01:31:30]  I'm not homophobic like that.  Yeah.  And it was so funny, we were talking about, like, getting a guy to help design a desk for my apartment  just, like, two years ago.  So...  In the shape of a dick.  Everything was cock-shaped.  Two big ball drawers.  We were talking about some designer, some pretty well-known designer in New York, who...  I'm like...  We were going to try to get some advice from him.  The guy charges a lot of money to even consult.  So he's like, I could call him and ask him. 
[01:32:00]  And I'm like, well, do you know him?  He goes, oh, I shot a load on his face so big, it pulled up in his eye.  I'm like, oh, no shit.  I guess you do know him.  That's funny.  Jesus.  Dude, that's not even as uncomfortable as the leaning against the chest.  No, the leaning was rough.  Again, again, the hardcore porno stuff isn't even disturbing.  He fucking blasted the guy's eyes shut and wanted to call for advice.  And I heard him talking on the phone about me and my awful taste.  He has shades. 
[01:32:30]  I don't know.  I told him.  You know, it's really funny.  He's bashing me.  I got one more quick story about these two.  We invited him to the wedding and stuff.  And, you know, you make the rounds.  And I went to their table near the end of the night, so they had a nice buzz going on.  Oh.  And now they're pointing people out in the room.  And I know all of them, obviously.  There's brothers, mostly brothers and cousins.  And they're like, who's that guy?  Like, oh, that's my...  I don't even want to say which brother because, you know...  Oh, that's my brother, Blank. 
[01:33:00]  Ooh.  Oh, they started loosening up a bit.  And then my...  Has to be Quinn.  Has to be.  Yeah, it was.  Has to be.  They were a big fan of Quinn.  Of course they were.  And then my cousin, Patrick, got a biggie.  Yeah.  Oh, they...  Got a big ooh.  And I'm like, dude, stop.  This is too much.  I always...  I'm able to say, look, this is too much.  Yeah, slow down.  Slow down.  This is my...  That's my brother.  Family guy, yeah.  But they were working the room, like, just looking at all of them. 
[01:33:30]  Let's go to Brian in Texas.  Brian.  Brian.  Good evening.  Hey.  Hey, Opie, did you say that your friends who happened to be gay had a mountain house?  What was that?  No.  It's a mountain house.  Mountain house.  It's not a mountain house.  A mountain house.  A mountain house.  Look at it.  Here he goes.  Right.  Jesus.  It's so hard to be mature on this show. 
[01:34:00]  The rest of the clip.  So, Perez says Miss USA should be politically correct.  That's where we were.  Because it was a bad answer.  Why is it bad if it was honesty?  Honesty is great.  However, in an interview this morning, she said that the audience and the judges expected  her to be politically correct.  You want to know what?  Yes.  I do expect Miss USA to be politically correct.  Do we want Miss USA that's politically insensitive?  That's politically offensive?  No.  So, I didn't disagree with that.  Do you see what a fucking phony fucking jerk-off this guy is? 
[01:34:30]  It's not about you, you asshole.  What's the matter, jerk-off?  You want to be able to draw little cum stains on people's faces?  Yeah.  And you want to be able to be honest and express yourself through your humor.  Right.  But she can't be honest when asked and express herself.  He makes me fucking sick.  Without him having to fucking ruin her chances.  Oh, this guy is just a fucking asshole.  What a little bitch.  He is a little bitch.  Especially, like, because he's saying he wants her to be politically correct, and he 
[01:35:00]  wants to be able to do it.  And I'm not running for Miss USA.  Well, then you shouldn't be involved.  Why are you involved in the process?  If she should be politically correct, shouldn't that process have such integrity that a guy  that draws little cum bubbles on people has no part in the voting process?  How the fuck are you involved in it if it's an integrity-filled event, jerk-off?  God, I love you, Jim.  How is he on that?  I hate this fucking guy.  How is he on that show?  Was it on NBC?  Yeah, it was on NBC.  It was a Trump show. 
[01:35:30]  It was on NBC.  How did they let this fucking...  Because he's a big star.  For what?  I don't know.  Big star.  He's a big blogger that became pretty huge.  He's extremely offensive.  Why would a network let him on there?  He's a douchebag.  Exactly, yeah.  Why all of a sudden politically correct?  What does he do to push that agenda?  Yeah.  Other than fucking make little snarky cum...  I got it.  He's a douchebag.  She answered the question honestly.  But his gay agenda won't allow him to just take that answer at face value. 
[01:36:00]  At fucking splooge on his face value.  So now this chick that doesn't win the competition probably.  Hot as fucking hell.  Because she answers...  Ridiculous.  In a way that I don't even agree with her answer.  I think even my gay friends would bang her.  Yeah.  But she shouldn't be Miss USA.  She answers in a way that reflects the majority of the country's feelings.  Exactly.  Yeah.  People want to know how Steve afforded a mountain house on his salary.  Sean in North Carolina. 
[01:36:30]  Jim, did Steve decorate your house?  What?  What happened?  Are we still looking at more pictures of her?  My God.  Danny popped up a picture.  That's not her.  No, I don't care who the fuck that is.  Is that Miss Vermont?  No.  That's Miss Teen USA.  Holy shit.  You cannot tell me.  She's got to be 18, right?  Not in that photo.  What?  How old is she?  For real.  Come on.  Holy mother of Christ on a pony. 
[01:37:00]  Hang on.  Let me just make sure I got my facts straight here.  Look at her fucking tits.  Stop it.  I'm good at this.  She's 16 years old.  No, no.  She was Miss Teen USA 2006.  She was 18.  Her name is Katie Blair.  Katie Blair rules.  She's delicious.  Dude, look at the fucking camel toe in that green bikini bottom.  Let me see it, buddy.  Look at the supple bosom.  You know what?  The bosom's a little saggy for 18. 
[01:37:30]  What?  For 18 a little saggy.  No, they got the weight to him in that bikini top.  Maybe the bikini top's a little tight because they're pushing him down a little bit.  A little bit.  You talking shit about her?  NBC invited Perez on purpose to make this happen.  You know what?  Oh, is that it?  Good for Miss California, though, because now everyone knows about Miss California.  That's true.  Because most of these pageant broads go away and you never hear from them.  You're right.  Who knows about fucking the winner?  I bet you this one will do very well for herself now.  Miss Vermont, and Vermont is such a politically correct state, too. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  But she gave a nice answer.  She didn't say that they're assholes or godless people.  She said, this is the way I was raised.  She called the truth.  Both is good, but I personally am into this, and I think blah, blah, blah.  And then that idiot probably gave her a fucking zero.  Here's the last part of the clip.  That's politically insensitive, that's politically offensive.  No.  So I didn't disagree with her not believing in the right for gays and lesbians to be equal 
[01:38:30]  under the law.  I disagree with how she answered the question, because Miss USA should be all-inclusive.  No.  That's not what fucking...  You're not including ugly girls in the fucking contest, asshole.  Exactly.  Shut up.  Where's Trump?  I don't know, to tell you the truth.  Trump should have stepped in.  I don't know what Miss USA should represent.  I really don't give a flying fuck.  She represents the hot chick.  I would think, yeah.  She represents the hot chick, and she doesn't have to represent every fucking group out there 
[01:39:00]  and be all-inclusive to shit that she doesn't fucking...  She's being open and honest.  What is she, a robot?  That she's supposed to be programmed to like everything and everybody that she bumps into?  Keep the politics out of it.  Fuck off, Perez Hilton.  What an asshole.  NBC owns half of the contest.  NBC, by the way, MSNBC fired Imus over his offensive comment. 
[01:39:30]  Yet they let this fucking offensive...  I find this guy offensive.  I personally find him offensive.  Way more offensive than Imus.  Why is NBC putting him on?  Ugh.  All right.  Good.  There you go.  Oh, and I hate that he gets airtime everywhere for this.  News story or fun?  Fun.  But news story could turn into fun.  It did last time because Danny kept bringing up pictures of hot girls. 
[01:40:00]  It's the best thing ever.  It really...  Hot girls rule.  Miss Teen USA is the best.  It really is a great contest.  Oh, by the way...  Show me another one.  Let's look at the chicks from this year.  Yeah.  All right.  Hold that for one second.  I want to get Crystal on the line because I know we'll get distracted by the snitch.  Crystal in Staten Island.  Hey, how are you boys doing?  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hello, Crystal.  Oh.  Hey, I got a question for you, Opia.  It seems like nobody's calling in to ask.  I'm really curious.  Did you guys actually go to Brokeback Mountain? 
[01:40:30]  Oh, was it a mountain retreat on Brokeback Mountain?  Yeah.  And also, actually really quick, also, did the boys snuggle up to a Javalog?  Javalogs?  Any Javalogs?  No Javalogs.  And it wasn't Brokeback Mountain?  No.  Any spitting in the hand prior to an assault in a tent?  I'll tell you this much.  When the whole mountain house visit came up, there was a discussion that I never saw Brokeback Mountain.  And they're like, oh, when you guys come to visit, we have to see Brokeback Mountain. 
[01:41:00]  Dude, if you're sitting in a room with two gay guys watching Brokeback Mountain, is that the movie that was on?  No, it didn't happen.  You have to draw the line.  Yes, you sometimes have to draw the line.  You can't be all in with gay friends.  I'm all in.  You can be all in with your friends.  Balls deep.  Like, think of your friends in your world.  You're all in, for the most part.  Sure.  Instead of mainlining heroin or whatever, but for the most part, you're all in. 
[01:41:30]  Gay friends, you got those lines.  You got a line because, you know.  I go, I can't sit there and watch Brokeback Mountain with you guys.  There's no way.  Yeah.  There's no way.  There are some moments, they'd probably be looking over at you to see your reaction when fucking Gyllenhaal gets it up the ass in the tent.  In front of your sweats.  Give you the tent test.  The tent, yeah.  Which is where one of them walks by and flicks the front of your sweatpants.  He tries to flick your little peeny. 
[01:42:00]  Sees if it goes back and forth like a windsock.  Christ.  So, news story or fun?  Fun news story.  Now I threw ye.  No, you didn't.  All right.  Oh, this is a biggie today.  Another biggie.  A very famous person is very ill.  Oh, I know.  It's too bad.  There's not much time left.  We'll have to talk to our friend when he comes at the end of the month. 
[01:42:30]  Stephen Hawking, the famed mathematician, is seriously ill.  No shit.  That's what I said.  And I'm like, how do you know?  I'm really sick.  Yeah, we know.  I'm sick.  Yeah, we know.  No, I'm really sick.  I know.  I do not feel good.  Yeah, we all know that.  We've known that for decades.  This is different.  How is it different?  I don't know.  I just feel very ill.  Iller than before.  Much iller than yesterday. 
[01:43:00]  My tummy hurts.  But you look exactly the same.  How can you be any sicker than you already are?  I just feel I am sicker.  Take me to a doctor, please.  What's wrong with you?  I'm not sure.  I feel imminent death, though.  Don't you feel that every day you wake up?  Yes.  So what's different? 
[01:43:30]  I can't quite put my finger on it or anything.  It's just an instinct I have.  I'm a genius, and I say I'm sick.  Poor bastard.  How does he know?  I don't know.  Like, how do you sit there and go, uh-oh, I better go to the doctor?  Oh, this is a little different.  Yeah.  This is just a different feeling.  The only thing you can feel at this point is, what, one eyelid?  I don't know. 
[01:44:00]  I either have pink eye or a stroke.  It's a cold or cancer.  Cambridge University said Hawking is being treated at a hospital for complications related  to a chest infection.  Hawking had canceled an appearance at Arizona State University on April 6th because of his  illness.  The 67-year-old, renowned for his work on black holes, has remained active despite being  diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease at the age of 21. 
[01:44:30]  He's had Lou Gehrig's disease for 46 years?  Holy shit.  Dude, not to bring everyone down, but I sort of knew someone that got that.  Actually, my brother...  You know everybody.  No, it was a close friend of my brother-in-law got the Lou Gehrig's.  He did...  I don't even think he lasted 18 months.  Wow.  Done.  Out.  See you later.  This guy's had it for 46 years?  That Lou Gehrig is supposed to take you out quick. 
[01:45:00]  They should rename it.  Stephen Hawking?  Yeah.  Hey, Stephen, how about this?  How about you fucking...  You're Nick's Black Holes, idiot, and start focusing on Lou Gehrig's disease?  Yeah, why?  You asshole.  He wasted all those years.  The smartest guy in the universe, and he can't even get his fucking bottom of his shoes  dirty.  Fucking asshole.  How about you think of those terms?  Yeah, he's not that smart, Jimmy.  What a dunce.  Oh, shit.  You get it at 21, you're this brilliant mind.  When you spend, yeah, the next 46 years of your life trying to walk again? 
[01:45:30]  Trying to get some of that poo-ha?  Yeah.  Whew.  Black holes, and now he might have some black holes in his lungs.  Oh, the poor lad.  21?  21.  He's got Lou Gehrig's disease at the age of 21.  For some years, he has been almost entirely paralyzed and communicates through an electronic  voice synthesizer activated by his fingers.  Hawking announced last year that he would step down from his post as Lucasian professor of  Mathematics, a title once held by the great 18th century physicist Isaac Newton at the end 
[01:46:00]  of this academic year.  Wow.  Is that a photoshopped picture?  Did they use smear on that shot of him?  His face really looks like that?  Oh, my God.  Dude, it looks like they used smear when they, like, yeah.  I know the smear.  Oh, is he fucked up?  God.  What a fucking, like, what a brilliant dude.  Like, because he can't even write shit down.  He can't even show all work.  No. 
[01:46:30]  No.  Just think of math all day.  How do you do that?  When you can't do anything else.  Yeah, that's true.  He probably would have been a waste if he was, like, if he never got that, he'd just be  fucking.  In his 40s, you would have got married.  Yeah.  Settle down.  Find a nice girl.  Well, we got more info on this.  Cody in Indiana.  Cody.  Nobody could tell he was sick until he made his computer go, ah, chew.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, shoo.  Cody's good for one. 
[01:47:00]  Vic, the trucker, Vic.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, I got one observation on that Perez Hilton and the pageant.  Yeah.  A little ironic that isn't the whole pageant pretty much politically correct as it looks  at women?  Yeah, good point.  Excellent point.  Yeah.  Is he going to stand there and say that?  You're right, dude.  Swimsuit competition.  Yeah.  Yeah, that has been something that, like, the National Organization for Women have been all over that contest for years  because it's so politically incorrect and makes women just look like sex objects and, you know. 
[01:47:30]  I don't disagree with.  Dude, I love those stupid contests.  If I'm cruising the channels and I see it, I've got to stop.  I just always miss them.  And then you're like, oh, I think she's going to win.  She's got to win.  Oh, that one's hot.  That is the hottest girl I've ever seen.  Holy shit, no.  That's the hottest girl I've ever seen.  It's a matter of who wins.  No, who cares?  It's a matter of who wins.  Thank you, sir.  That's all I got, boys. 
[01:48:00]  Have a good day.  All right.  All right.  Wow.  Yeah, here's Kevin in Connecticut.  Kevin.  Morning, fellas.  Hey, Kevin.  How long did Hawking have Lou Gehrig's disease?  46 years, I guess.  Jesus Christ.  Lou Gehrig's only had Lou Gehrig's disease for seven months.  Yeah, this thing is supposed to take you out quick.  Starts with a twitch.  Next thing you know, you're completely paralyzed and dead.  Yeah, well, Lou Gehrig, in those days, they had polio, too, so it's not like they could  fix that up.  No, I still get you pretty quickly.  Stephen Hawking's days are numbered. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  I'd love to give a speech at Yankee Stadium.  Consider myself the silliest goose.  Stephen Hawking has three kids and a grandchild.  Jesus.  Somebody's been milking those balls while he slept.  He had no part in that.  Fucking genius nuts.  That's what they want.  They want the filling of those genius nuts.  He can't come unless he's doing a Sudoku puzzle.  Let's go to Cindy.  She's got more info on Stephen Hawking.  I always said Stephen Hawking. 
[01:49:00]  It's Stephen Hawking, yeah.  Cindy, go ahead.  Hello, boys.  Long time, first time.  Yes, I was reading up on Stephen Hawking's, and I found out that he's been married twice  as three children and a grandchild.  He was able to convince two women?  How does he do that?  I don't know.  Maybe it was a real doll.  I don't know.  He can get a boner?  How old is his kids?  I want to know about the kids.  Are they geniuses?  Yeah, I don't know.  They're probably just pothead douches.  Oh, right? 
[01:49:30]  Imagine that.  Just doesn't get the fucking good sperm up there.  Yeah.  Nope.  All right, Cindy.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Wow.  You imagine you only pass along the Lou Gehrigs?  Yeah.  Fuck if the kids had a dumbbell with Lou Gehrigs and you're like, that'd be.  This didn't work out.  John in Buffalo.  What's up with Buffalo today?  You guys need attention?  A lot of calls coming in from Buffalo.  It's cold and rainy, boys.  Let's get it all wrong about Lou Gehrig.  I bet you the first time that they knew he was sick with his money, he was actually able  to move his legs.  Hey, that would be a weird twist. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, wow.  His sickness kind of counteracts the Lou Gehrigs.  He gets out of the chair, falls, breaks his hip, and dies.  Right.  All those kids have Pete Rose haircut disease.  I've got to make pee-pees.  It's all baseball.  I've got to make pee-pees.  All baseball.  I've got to make pee-pees.  Sunset Thomas will be here in about 20 minutes.  And Brie Olsen.  Yes.  Yeah?  The lovely Brie.  Sunset Thomas is promoting her last porno, and I think one of our listeners got the banger  in the porno.  Oh, wow.  Really?  So we'll find out more about that. 
[01:50:30]  And Brie Olsen, you know, fan fave.  Big heavy breasts.  Fan favorite.  Yeah.  She's got a new movie, Brie's Big Campout.  I wonder what happens on the campout.  Ooh, I can't wait to find out.  I bet you that they run out of marshmallows and things of that ilk.  I wonder, I hope there's no shenanigans on this movie.  Well, I certainly hope so myself.  I'm sure Brie likes camping.  It's a camping movie, huh?  Yeah, probably.  Maybe Brie forgets her tent.  Yeah.  Has to share a tent with someone else. 
[01:51:00]  With someone else.  Some lesbian girls.  And then what do you think happens in that tent?  I imagine that they doze off.  Yeah.  Go to sleep.  Wake up.  Do some fishing.  Sure.  Do you think they tell ghost stories?  Make sure they put the fire out responsibly.  And then they go home.  Do you think Ted the camper's going to be there?  I think he will be.  Oh, yes.  Ted loves camping.  I hate the woods.  There's always those crinkly leaves sounds, Gregory.  It always frightens me.  What's wrong with the crinkly leaves?  Sounds like there's a possum approaching.  My testicles were nibbled on by a possum when I was a baby. 
[01:51:30]  That's horrible.  Yes, it was.  But if you hear the crinkling leaves, that's good.  You know there might be an animal in the area.  Yes, but I start screaming, go away!  And then I hold jelly out the tent window door.  Boo!  Tent window door.  That's right.  I have a tent with glass and a door in it.  It's very heavy.  Too bad Ted the Improver didn't show up. 
[01:52:00]  Everyone's saying we should play the Family Guy clip.  You want to do it, Danny?  All right.  Jesus.  Sorry, I can't give credit to anyone because too many people are asking for it today.  Let's go to break with this.  Do you want long?  Because this is actually a pretty long clip if you just want, because I think there's  a part where Hawking and his wife argue they make up sex, so why don't we just do the  whole thing?  Yeah, let's just go with it.  Who cares?  Okay.  Opie and Anthony.  Ah, Ryan, I am glad you could come to my faculty cocktail party. 
[01:52:30]  Let me introduce my wife, Helen.  Damn it, Steve, you forgot to put out the cheese and crackers.  Helen, don't start with me in front of our guests.  Do you think I like hitting you?  I am sorry you had to see that.  Look, sir, I really need to confess something to you.  That assignment I turned in.  You know, Ryan, before you came along, I was so depressed. 
[01:53:00]  I was planning to kill myself, but you have inspired me.  If you can learn, maybe one day I can walk.  Now, what was it you wanted to say?  Uh, nothing.  You were supposed to get potato chips, you jackass.  Damn it, Helen.  Get the hell off my back or so help me, so help me.  Don't worry.  I hear they have great makeup sex.  Oh, that feels so good. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, oh, like that.  Oh, oh, I've thought about this all day.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, not so fast.  You are hurting me.  Yeah.  Oh, the curtains are being closed.  Yes.  That's good.  You know what that means.  Killing me the name-o.  We got Brie Olsen coming in.  Our friend.  Girls. 
[01:54:00]  Whenever girls come in, we got to close the curtains.  And we got Sunset Thomas, an old friend coming in.  Yeah.  We met her when we were at AAF.  Yeah.  Any Real Rock TV clips of her?  I haven't found any yet.  Oh, know what I found?  And us doing something stupid?  What?  I found another videotape, but it really sucks.  It might not be worth putting on YouTube of us weighing this girl's boobs.  Really, really huge, heavy boobs.  I remember that.  And she was such a mess.  Then we had her do some boob art. 
[01:54:30]  Yes.  Yeah, the paint and then the canvas.  Yeah.  Paint on the boobs.  Maybe I'll find a better clip of that.  I don't know.  I remember how we were trying to weigh the boob and figure out.  We had to figure out if she was putting her body weight into it.  Yeah.  It's pretty hard to weigh a breast.  Well, we had the scale for packages.  Yeah.  But, yeah.  There's a science to it.  I think the best way is through water displacement.  It's probably the best, most accurate way to weigh a breast. 
[01:55:00]  Hey, you know what?  We should try that technique.  Yeah.  I like that.  We'll see if it works.  It beats just hacking one off and throwing it on the scale.  True.  True.  Snakes on a Plane was on TV.  Oh, no.  What?  It was not.  Oh, it was not.  I saw this last night.  Oh, you did see it?  Well, I saw this clip and Sam pulled it this morning.  I'm sick of these mother falcon snakes.  Dude, it's...  Mr. Falcon.  It is definitely...  Yes, it's better than that.  Oh, no. 
[01:55:30]  It is definitely...  This is definitely...  I think it's the all-time best.  It's the all-time best.  Wow, really?  Yeah, I think so.  Because we talk about these TV movie edits that, obviously, the movie is full of curses.  It's very hard to just cut the whole part out.  So they replace the offensive word with some stupid word that barely makes sense and usually doesn't even make any sense.  We love the TV edit.  Yeah, the TV edit.  It's the most famous line in the whole movie. 
[01:56:00]  Right.  It's, you know, the motherfucking snakes on the motherfucking plane.  That's the big line.  That's the get.  That's the thing everyone's waiting to hear Samuel L. Jackson say.  Yeah.  Let's get into this.  Sarah in Boston.  It's Stephen Lynch.  Someone's actually asking who that was playing the If I Were Gay song.  Stupid Bill, fucking retard.  And Bobby and Brockton pointing out that I said killing in the name when it's Bulls on Parade.  And I do it every time.  Here is Snakes on a Plane, the original. 
[01:56:30]  Right.  Clip.  Enough is enough.  I have had it with these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane.  Everybody strap in.  We're about to open some fucking windows.  Oh, no.  All right.  That's a big scene.  That's the scene.  That's the scene.  Oh, no.  That's the...  Remember when that movie first came out and there was all the blogging hype about it,  that that was the line that everybody wanted in the movie, so they edited the script so  it would be in the movie? 
[01:57:00]  So he actually says, because Samuel L. Jackson is known for saying motherfucker very well  in movies.  I watch movies just to hear him say it.  Yeah.  Motherfucker.  This is how they did it on TV last night.  Hold on.  Oh, no.  He's cringing already.  Enough is enough.  I have had it with these monkey-fighting snakes on this Monday to Friday plane.  Everybody strap in.  I'm about to open some freaking windows.  Oh, wait a minute. 
[01:57:30]  Get the fuck out of here.  Monkey-fighting snakes on this Monday to Friday plane.  On this Monday to Friday plane.  What is a Monday to Friday plane?  That plane doesn't run on weekends.  It's a long flight, apparently.  Wow.  Worst ever.  Wait, what do you got to do this?  That is the worst movie edit ever.  So bad, we got to do it all over again.  The original.  Enough is enough.  I have had it with these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane. 
[01:58:00]  Everybody strap in.  I'm about to open some fucking windows.  All right.  Oh, my God.  And then?  Enough is enough.  I have had it with these monkey-fighting snakes on this Monday to Friday plane.  Everybody strap in.  I'm about to open some freaking windows.  Holy shit.  That is brutal.  Monkey-fighting.  Monkey-fighting. 
[01:58:30]  Why can't they just beep it?  Just beep the word.  Yeah.  So everyone knows.  No one rides a Monday to Friday plane.  And what's a monkey-fighting snake?  It's like a snake.  Like, if there was a monkey that were fighting the snakes, the snakes would win.  Oh, oh.  Yeah, but the snakes never fight a monkey in the movie.  No, not in the movie.  No.  No.  Danny's brilliant with, uh, with...  Yeah, I know.  Danny's brilliant with the Google.  Find me a monkey...  Wait, wait.  A monkey-fighting snake.  A monkey-fighting snake.  Now, is that a monkey fighting a snake? 
[01:59:00]  No, no, no, no.  No, no, it's a monkey-fighting snake.  Oh, okay.  It's like a man-eating tiger.  If I'm a mic-holding Sam, it means I'm holding a mic.  Yeah.  But a man-eating tiger isn't a guy taking a bite out of a tiger.  No.  No, it's a tiger who eats man.  So, a monkey-fighting snake is a snake who fights monkey.  All right.  But aren't all snakes and monkeys fighting each other if they're put in the room together?  They never get along, so technically, isn't that every snake? 
[01:59:30]  Monkeys don't get along with anything.  Why are they not closing the mirror?  Oh, my God.  Don't worry.  People at that end of the hall are not interested in naked women.  They might just call the police, not knowing what it is.  There's some kind of a drain with hair on it.  All right, not a hair on it.  By the way, the teeth on this fucking pirate.  I love when Kevin Dillon fucking bashed his breath in.  He had his fucking head come apart. 
[02:00:00]  It's the way he laughs.  Alfonso Soriano teeth.  The pirate.  He's in New York, right?  He is having the time of his life here in America.  Wouldn't you?  He loves it.  He's going to be taken care of now.  Yeah, it's going to be better than any living conditions he ever had.  Prison is going to be great for him.  He's probably going to go to school in prison.  He'll get fed.  He'll make friends because, you know, he's from Somalia.  He's an OG.  They're going to love his pirate. 
[02:00:30]  Are they OGs?  He's going to love his pirate.  Well, Somalis are OGs.  I love how the slit in the door.  Oh, that's got a little curtain on it?  No, it doesn't.  The slit in the door?  Who are you talking about?  Are they here already?  Getting ready for Sunset Thomas and Briel's.  Monday to Friday plane.  I like the Monday to Friday plane.  Oh, someone commutes.  Hey, we have...  I don't remember asking you a goddamn thing.  Monday to Friday plane.  Horrid. 
[02:01:00]  A monkey fighting snake.  We have other TV edits, but I don't know if we have time to...  Did we do these from Die Hard 2, Dogma, Platoon, and Smokey and the Bandit?  I got to hear the Die Hard one.  You want to hear that again?  Yeah, that's one of my favorites.  Die Hard was full of curses, dirty words.  We'll do this quick because they're coming down the hall.  Die Hard 2, the original clip.  Yeah, I'm there.  Victor.  Victor.  Yeah, what's up?  Did you pack the radio mics from the shoot or did you put them in your carry-on? 
[02:01:30]  Are you crazy?  I wouldn't let those assholes check them in.  I love you.  Give me one of the receivers.  Okay, so they have to cover up asshole in that clip.  Victor.  Victor.  Yeah, what's up?  Did you pack the radio mics from the shoot or did you put them in your carry-on?  Are you crazy?  I wouldn't let those...  It's anime.  ...check them in.  Damn you, the receivers.  Getting info on the snakes on a plane thing.  Yeah.  Daniel in Oklahoma.  Daniel.  Yeah, I own snakes on a plane on DVD. 
[02:02:00]  I don't know how bad of a guy that is, but on the commentary, if you watch it, they talk  about that in particular, and they say that they had to make a clean edit for TV, and they  had Samuel L. Jackson say all kinds of ridiculous stuff just to make it silly.  So they did it on purpose.  Oh!  Boo!  We like to think that it was just god-awful.  It is god-awful.  Okay, look, don't that on my call, then.  All right.  Thanks, Daniel.  Well, knowledge.  Marginally funny snakes! 
[02:02:30]  Carmine, let me ask you something.  What sets off the metal detectors first?  The lead in your ass or the shit in your brain?  Oh, no.  That's not even a good line.  That's going to be a tough one, though.  What an 80s line that is.  Yeah.  Hey, Carmine, let me ask you something.  Uh-oh.  What sets off the metal detectors first?  The lead in your hat or the junk in your brains?  That freak.  Would they get Gandolfini to do that? 
[02:03:00]  I know!  Oh, my God.  That's so...  The lead in your hat?  Who is this fucking George Harrison?  What the fuck is that?  He had the lead in your hat.  That voice wasn't even the same.  Wow, Danny has found a monkey and a snake fighting.  It seems to be a baboon fighting with a cobra.  I love that baboon presents his ass to the snake.  Wow, that is a pissed off baboon. 
[02:03:30]  Why don't you just get out of there and climb a tree?  I know, you dummy.  Would you rather deal with the snake or the baboon in this video?  Baboon all the way.  The snake.  I'd run away.  The baboon can chase your ass and look at the teeth.  What if you can't run?  You can't run?  The snake ain't going to chase your legs on the chain.  Snake's a dummy.  Wow, snake strikes pretty fast.  Did you see what Travis the Chimp did to that lady's face?  Yeah, exactly.  This is a small one.  Look at the poor baboons all chained up with the snake. 
[02:04:00]  He's scared.  That guy's got him.  Is this a movie?  What's he doing?  How fast is that?  It's like a kung fu movie.  Oh, I think the cobra bit the monkey, though.  Did the cobra bite the monkey, Danny?  I don't know.  I've never seen this before.  I'm watching it with you guys.  I feel bad for the monkey.  He'd be cute if he didn't have that big, gaping, red asshole.  Danny, how did they find this?  Oh, look.  He's fighting the monkey.  This, I do believe, if you Google monkey fights cobra or monkey fighting cobra, you 
[02:04:30]  will...  Oh, this guy is learning martial arts lessons.  Yeah.  Show my...  You have to watch a monkey fight a snake.  Show your asshole to your opponent.  Or show your opponent you're an asshole.  In the back of F.H.  Riley.  Linger Linger.  What, um...  Well, you wanted it, and you got it.  And the martial artist is practicing the monkey moves.  Yes.  Yes, the monkey moves.  What he's doing?  What a great actor he is.  Yeah, the monkey. 
[02:05:00]  He's leaping about.  Well, the monkey is, uh...  That monkey's a ballsy monkey.  Yeah.  He's just fucking with the snake.  He's jumping right over the snake's head, and the snake is striking at him, but not hitting  him, I guess.  He's plump tuckered out.  If you can play the soundtrack right now, they're playing that song, The Monkey Jumps  the Snake.  Wow.  Jimmy Jumps the Shark.  Oh, boy. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, the monkey goes around and around in circles.  Oh, he bit its head.  Oh, it's over.  Game over.  The monkey bit the snake's head.  Game over.  Snake's down.  That's a monkey fighting snake.  Yeah, we found one.  Find a Monday through Friday plane.  Oh.  Oh.  I could do that.  All right.  You better do that.  Here's another TV edit.  Original clip from Die Hard 2.  Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker. 
[02:06:00]  We all know that one, right?  Oh, who doesn't remember that?  Sure.  It's a famous classic line.  Yo.  Yippee-ki-yay, Mr. Falcon.  A totally different voice.  And Mr. Falcon, who is not Hans Gruber.  Who is Mr. Falcon?  Why?  Who's Mr. Falcon?  Who's Mr. Falcon?  There is no Mr. Falcon in that movie. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  Not one Mr. Falcon.  Not a one?  No.  How about Mr. Falk?  He's yelling at Columbo.  And here's your Monday through Friday plane.  I need those detonators.  This is Janet Airlines.  It's the planes that take the workers to Area 51.  And that's a Monday through Friday plane.  It's a Monday through Friday plane.  So you did find a monkey fighting snake and a Monday through Friday plane.  On the Google.  Goddamn Danny.  On the Google.  It's got blacked out windows, right?  Yeah.  I think it's got blacked out windows and a red stripe.  And there's no tail numbers. 
[02:07:00]  I don't think.  Wow.  You hear about the astronauts saying that aliens exist?  Area 51.  Area 51.  Shut up.  You heard about that astronaut guy?  Well, who was this other one?  I did hear there was another guy.  Another one, right?  Oh, who is it?  We'll get to that story after the broads.  Because they're peeking in and all that.  Let me say hi to Danny in Kentucky before we get Sunset Thomas in here.  Danny.  Yeah, man.  What's up?  The best editor of all time was smoking the bandit.  The famous line, you scumbitch.  He says, you scumbum on TV. 
[02:07:30]  Scumbum.  Yeah, the scumbum line.  You scumbum.  And it was the same voice that the guy that did the new Fred Flintstone.  We got the...  Wow.  How do you know that?  Horrible.  Someone told me.  Oh, okay.  I don't know if we got that particular one.  We got this one, though.  Oh, I love your suits.  You must be a bitch getting a size 68 extra fat and a 12 dwarf.  I came to make a deal.  What's he get if he wins this truck rodeo thing? 
[02:08:00]  If?  $5,000, David.  Chicken ship money.  It's what the hell you want, anyway.  You to get out of this dumbass rodeo and accept a real challenge.  That's not a good one.  No.  You want to hear what it is?  It's a long clip.  It is a long clip.  Let me try that out.  What the fuck is that about?  We just wrecked the whole bit.  The bits.  We ruined it.  $1,000, David.  Chicken feed money.  Just what the heck you want, anyway.  You to get out of this dumb old rodeo and accept a real challenge. 
[02:08:30]  Wow.  We can't end it with that.  No.  Don't go home from Smoking the Bandit.  Any of these sound familiar?  Don't go home.  As far as good ones?  She was dancing.  Don't play with yourselves.  She was dancing.  Yeah, she was dancing.  Possum Pecker.  Yeah, that's all Gleason.  Yeah, try Possum Pecker.  Or she was dancing's Gleason, too, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, because if you're doing Smoking the Bandit, it's Gleason.  She was dancing.  No, she was dancing back up the aisle. 
[02:09:00]  Her knack was bouncing all over the joint.  Let her go that way.  Her ass was wiggling, too.  Her ass was wiggling, too.  No, she was dancing back up the aisle.  Her neck was breaking all over the joint.  Let go that way.  That's fake fucking crap.  Her neck was breaking all over the joint.  That's better than actually wiggling.  Hey, Barney!  Her neck breaking?  Her neck was breaking all over the joint.  Ew. 
[02:09:30]  What's that even mean?  Nobody makes Sheriff Buford T. Justice look like a Possum Pecker.  Except for that, you're aware.  Shut your ass.  The best time in the line ever.  Bravo to Gleason on that line.  Gleason's head kind of dips.  Shut your ass.  He does the famous Gleason.  Shut your ass.  Except for that, because Junior had an example ready.  Yes!  He did, and Gleason did want to hear it. 
[02:10:00]  Somebody made a Possum's Pecker out of Puberty Justice.  Except, shut your ass.  Except that, shut your ass.  So, that's a perfectly living line.  And now, this asshole is going to screw it all up.  Nobody.  Nobody makes Sheriff Buford T. Justice look like a Possum's pouch.  Except for that, you're fake.  Shut your face.  Holy shit.  That is so bad.  Why would you watch movies on TV?  That is so bad. 
[02:10:30]  I don't want to look like a...  Hey, Barney!  That's terrible.  Fake friend.  It certainly is.  One more, and then we'll move on.  Did you see that?  They went right to a roadblock.  You sumbitches couldn't close an umbrella.  Umbrella.  What's wrong with Sons of Bitches on TV?  Nothing.  It's probably TVS in 78.  Did you see that?  They went right to a roadblock.  You scumbuzzards couldn't close an umbrella.  I would say scumbuzzards is worse.  Scumbuzzards is a buzzard full of jism. 
[02:11:00]  Right.  That's right.  Picture Patty with cum on her.  Oh, stop it.  Oh, come on, Jimmy.  I look good for my eyes.  When does Patty make the first appearance in the serious building?  I don't know, but let's get a fucking chicken here.  Hopefully it's plummeting from the roof.  Yeah, let's get Sunset in here.  All right.  Sunset Thomas making her way...  Oh, no.  You're not Sunset Thomas.  You're an intern with...  You're an intern with grapes.  Exactly.  With a very controversial fruit. 
[02:11:30]  And now...  Oh, hi.  Hi, Sunset.  Good evening.  How are you?  Big ol' hug.  How are you doing?  Oh, good.  How are you?  That's great.  How are you?  I'm doing good.  How are you?  It's been a while.  Oh, good.  Oh, well.  Yeah.  Turn that around a little bit.  Hi, Sunset.  Right there next to your favorite friend, Jimmy Norton.  Hello.  Hello, honey.  Good evening.  Good evening.  Good evening.  How are you?  Or is it more like good morning?  Yeah, it's a good morning.  It is kind of morning.  But you know what? 
[02:12:00]  I was so excited to come on and see you guys again.  You wouldn't know that.  What?  I've been quite a while.  Underwear.  You have no underwear?  Oh, my God.  Let me see.  I saw some kind of...  I was so excited.  I just saw a vagina.  You missed it.  You missed it.  Thank you.  You wear a very short skirt and no pins.  I see you're going old school with a little hair down.  A little hair.  A little bit.  A little bit of hair.  What's up with the little hair down there?  A little hair on top, but I keep it really shaved towards the bottom.  Do you ever shave it off?  Huh?  Do you ever shave it off?  Yeah, I've shaved it off before. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  That's that little wood floor, they call it.  I'm kind of going more old school now, you know?  Why don't you go real old school, like 70s?  Yeah.  Get that big, hairy muff.  You ever do that like when you're going to be off for a while and you don't want to like...  Grow it all the way out to the hips.  It looks like big panties.  Are you going down and all of a sudden...  You know, guys these days don't understand a good fucking pube gag.  They don't understand what it's like to have to use your fingers like a machete and separate those hairs. 
[02:13:00]  Well, a vagina's closed up like a Venus flytrap and you've got to kind of pull the hairs apart and then you're going...  Well, I can't relate.  It's just as bad on a guy when you go down on a guy and it's like his balls and he's got all that hair down there.  Oh, tell me about it.  It's not just the girls.  Jim is informing.  You like it shaved, right?  Huh?  I shave my bag.  I like the balls shaved, you know, but I like a little hair around, you know, the cock area. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nothing worse than...  I like a man with hair and a hairy chest and stuff.  Yeah.  A little Stanley hair.  Let's see.  Burt Reynolds.  Yeah.  On his head.  I like it.  A fucking Mets hat.  You know what I'm saying?  Mets hat.  No, none.  Jimmy is an American hairless.  Yes.  You won't find a speck on him.  Whoa!  There we go.  Wow, those are lovely.  Hey, not bad.  Some bosoms.  Some bosoms.  Bosoms. 
[02:14:00]  Wow, that's a hairy bush on the internet there, Danny.  You found a good one.  God damn, you washed your car with that.  Yeah, looking at a hairy bush there.  Oh, my God.  Now, because I know some girls, there are times that you don't shave your legs for a while.  If you're not doing anything, it'll wink her.  Yeah.  Like, sometimes girls get lazy.  Do you get lazy down there and just let it grow in?  Yeah, sometimes.  I just let it go.  Yeah, let it go.  Yeah.  Does your husband ever, you're married, right?  Yeah.  Does he ever get, like, weird, like, hey, look, if you shave it for movies or whatever, 
[02:14:30]  like, why don't you, like, does he ever get, like, what the fuck, you dress, you look  a certain way to go do a film, could you look that way for me?  I'd look that way for him, too.  Maybe he likes hair.  No, but I'm saying, like, you don't mean.  Oh, you're talking about the hairy legs?  Well, anything, yeah, like, because, you know, you have to look good when you do a movie,  so if you're just lounging around the house in sweats, does he go, like, well, how come  you don't put on a skirt like you put on a dance or any of that stuff?  Yeah, I don't have that issue.  No?  No.  Hey, no.  But I do, like, sleep naked a lot, so, you know.  Oh, I don't go for that.  Oh, I make up for it.  Why do you have a nice boob job, and a lot of the women have the horrible boob job? 
[02:15:00]  Well, because, you know, that's obviously, not obviously, that's what I'm getting at.  That's an amazing boob job.  Here, feel it.  Come here.  All right.  Here, feel it.  Squeeze it.  No, seriously.  I am.  Believe me, you don't have to yell at me.  Those are actually very, very, very realistic.  Oh.  Oh, Dan.  He goes, oh.  Oh, how did they feel good?  Well, what I did was, actually, I saw Gough Fisher.  Gough Fisher, he's actually out of California, a very expensive doctor, cost me about $8,000  for these. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, yeah?  But why go to some cheap doctor and get a really bad, yucky boob job?  What were you before?  Spend the money.  This is my body, you know.  If I'm going to do it, I want to do it.  Do it right.  Right.  What were you before?  Because that makes a big difference.  When I first started the business, I was probably an A.  Really?  Yeah.  So why does it look like it's stretched out, like the girls that get the boob job, and it  looks like two softballs under their chest?  Oh, my God.  Because I take really good care of them.  And usually the nipples get stretched under their armpits or something. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, that's really weird when someone tries to go to it.  I get that weird wrinkle on the side, you know, when I arch.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh.  What's up with that shit?  I know.  Gross.  Now, the boobs are holding up, so why are you retiring from the porn thing?  Well, you know, I've been at it for 18 years.  Luke Gehrig's disease.  You know, and I love what I do.  It's not like I'm going to go hide on a rock.  You know, we'll get in details in a minute about everything I got going on.  But it's time for me to start directing movies now.  Directing?  I'm going to start directing movies, but I'm not going to do that for a while. 
[02:16:30]  I'm actually focusing on my book right now.  A book and directing.  Which I have a book coming out.  What's the book?  It's called Anatomy of an Adult Film.  And what it is, it's fiction.  It's based on me being a porn star, a prostitute, and a stripper.  How is that fiction?  Well, because the reason why it's fiction is I have two characters that are actually in this book with me.  One is actually an older me, and one's a younger me.  But we venture off into different things.  Do you bring yourself a sports almanac? 
[02:17:00]  Huh?  I can never not say that.  But the great thing is when you actually read the book, each chapter has so many great  sex about, you know, screwing people and this and that and having fun.  And I'm teaching the younger me.  And the neat thing is I actually get to have sex with myself, too.  It's kind of cool.  How do you do that?  Huh?  It's fiction.  But isn't that a paradox?  If you would have sex with yourself, wouldn't the older you remember having sex with yourself? 
[02:17:30]  Are we using lost timeline or back to the future timeline?  Well, I don't know.  We're both, I guess.  See, wouldn't you remember that?  No clue.  How does older you meet younger you?  Yeah.  Well, because it's in the book.  It's just the way the book goes.  What transpires?  Have you read the book yet?  You guys.  What was written for you?  Is there a time machine involved?  You'll have to actually get in there and check it out.  All you have to do is go to anatomyadultfilm.com and check it out and get in more detail. 
[02:18:00]  I don't want to give in too much detail about it.  No, no.  I don't want any detail.  That's why you've got to go and buy the book.  I just need to know how the older you meets the younger you.  Yeah.  That's all I want to know.  You've got to read it in the story in the book.  She has no idea.  No, I do, but I'm not going to give you a clue.  There's a DeLorean in it.  Beam me up, Scotty.  No?  Is there a big ship's wheel in a rock?  No.  No?  No.  Sunset.  Who wrote this book?  Sunset.  I wrote it. 
[02:18:30]  Sunset.  I actually have a partner who wrote it with me, too.  His name is Richard.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yes.  A ghost writer.  Of course.  He's got a bunch of other books out there as well.  And we did it together.  Did he figure out how the older you met the younger you?  And the paradox that's involved?  Tell me the details on it right now.  Do you understand the paradox?  I understand it.  No, I do understand it.  No, I do.  You can't tell yourself about your future.  It ruins things.  Well, what I do is take my younger me with the older me, you know, now in the future, 
[02:19:00]  teaching the younger one details on how it is to do porno movies.  Does this take place in the time that the younger you is alive, like in the past?  Or is it now, but somehow the younger you is up in now time?  It's actually the older me brings the younger me back.  To where?  The older you brings the younger you into the future.  Yeah, but we kind of go kind of in the future, too, but then we go in the past as well. 
[02:19:30]  Where does the book take place?  Wouldn't the younger you be more interested in finding out about things like the internet  instead of fucking right away?  I know when it makes a boring book, but I'd be like, holy shit, look at all the new shit around.  Well, actually, the great thing about it in the book is a lot of great sex and everything  like that in there.  I mean, guys and girls.  I mean, I teach her how to do all that kind of interesting stuff, you know?  What if she got pregnant?  Then what would you do, being the older you?  Would you remember being pregnant, and then would you have a daughter, and then her brain 
[02:20:00]  is going to be lost?  No, I would not do something like that, no.  No, but I don't know what happened.  Oh, she doesn't?  No, she doesn't get pregnant.  What are some of the other characters?  What about some of the other characters in the book?  Huh?  Some of the other characters?  Other characters, yeah.  Yeah, it's just...  Doc Emmett Brown?  There's a lot of different characters, like other porn stars that's been in the business,  stuff like that, you know, and she gets sex to meet all these other people.  What do you plan on reading this book?  Things like that.  All right, guys, stop picking on me.  He showed her a manuscript.  No! 
[02:20:30]  He showed her a manuscript, and he said, look, when are you available for the cover shoot?  No!  No, that's not true.  Not at all.  Jimmy, it's just...  Now, is there a Buford Mad Dog Thomas that is in the Old West?  That's a good question.  Very good question.  That I just...  What?  No, Sunset.  Come on.  What's wrong?  I'm just...  What's wrong?  I'm fascinated by...  You guys are picking on me.  ...by time travel.  I'm fascinated.  No, it's just what...  I actually sat down with my writer, and I go and detail some certain things that he doesn't  know nothing about, about how to do porno movies, or how's it like to be in a brothel, 
[02:21:00]  or how's it like to be a stripper, and anything about this book that I like about it, it's  because it's fiction.  Right.  So many people have got books out there right now talking about their life.  Oh, my life, and this is what I do.  Yeah, and who cares, right?  Yeah, it gets boring, you know?  And I go on the road a lot, and a lot of people want to know details on, wow, how's  it like to do porno movies, you know, and how's it like to be on a set, and stuff like  that, or how's it like to be in a brothel, and screwing your fans, and having sex with  your fans, and things like that, or being a stripper, and stuff like that, so that's 
[02:21:30]  one thing I like about this book, is I actually brought it out, and I thought it would be great  to have two different characters, like a young me and an older me.  That is kind of a weird thing.  Kind of teaching, and going through the route, and, you know, having great sex with different  people, and things like that, you know?  How does a fan go about having sex with you?  Yeah, yeah, how does that happen?  If you have a ranch for a while, they can just go there and see you.  Well, actually, I'm working now at the Wild Horse, and all you have to, it's another ranch  out in that area, and then all you have to do is just go to sunsetslife.com, I'm going 
[02:22:00]  to, I'll be going out there pretty soon, so.  Okay, so you have an appointment with you?  No, I'm still having, no, I'm still having sex with my fans, I mean, I'm not shooting  movies no more, but I'm still doing.  Really?  That's kind of cool, you can just, like, watch a point.  I love having sex with my fans.  And fuck a girl who you watch in the movie, that is kind of a, really?  Yeah.  Cool.  Yeah, that's an opportunity most people don't get.  No.  When you're scrapping to a movie, and then you're just like, oh, I get the fucker?  How'd you pick?  Pretty cool.  How'd you pick the guy that you fucked in this, Into the Sunset, your final XXX movie?  Well, what I did was a big contest out in Las Vegas. 
[02:22:30]  I had about 300 fans that came out.  We did a big promotion and advertisement and all that on it.  And what I did was, took 10 of the guys, did a big interview with them right there on stage  live at the Olympic Gardens, and then I picked Chris.  Chris is actually the fan that won the contest.  He's from Pennsylvania.  How big is Chris's penis?  He's a normal, everyday worker.  Hey, it's not the size.  No, I'm just curious.  Oh, shit, he's got a small dick.  Holy shit, he's got a small dick.  Are you kidding?  Oh, boy. 
[02:23:00]  I've had small dicks, and they're actually better than big dicks sometimes.  Really?  Yeah.  How big is Chris's penis?  Well, it's the average.  Okay.  She didn't want to go out in a fucking wheelchair.  She said, you know what, I'm going to take a nice, this is the final one, I'm going to  take a nice fucking easy ride here.  Well, and you know, the deep thing, too, is in my final movie, too, is I've always been  on set with Ron Jeremy.  Never have had sex with him, ever.  Why?  But in my final movie, I brought Ronnie in to teach Chris on how to actually do the moves.  Really?  Yeah, I banged him in the last movie. 
[02:23:30]  Huh?  How was it?  I went doggie style and just didn't look.  Yeah.  You wanted to just kind of get the idea.  You didn't want to look back.  I was like, I felt it.  That guy does look familiar.  It looks like Stone Cold Steve Austin.  To Stone Cold St. Paul.  It was fun, though.  I had a great time.  It was a great set, great people on it.  I mean, it was an awesome movie.  It really is.  So, I've got you guys a couple tapes.  I brought you some.  So, you've got one there today as well.  Yeah, we'll check out Into the Sunset.  Does Ron still keep a good rod? 
[02:24:00]  Huh?  Does Ron still keep a good rod when he's fucking?  Yeah, he keeps a good rod, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Sometimes he holds it down there, yeah.  A little plump.  You push it back.  As long as it gets a little plump.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's like, what, nine and a half inch mule and then fucking average Chris?  I kind of like that.  He needs the blood for his brain these days.  Can't all pump it into the cock.  I mean, come on.  Pass out.  Yeah, he's been doing it.  Wow, that's the, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's true.  He's fucking 300 women in his life, man.  Been in the business for a while.  Well, and you know, also, if you want to get the movie and if you can't find it in your 
[02:24:30]  dark stars, what you have to do is go to HustlerHollywood.com and you can order it there as well.  I have a question for you.  HustlerHollywood.com.  Girls have always tried to put a finger in my bum and I always feel like duty is going  to come out.  Even though it's not, it's not that it starts happening.  It's just that fear I have because of the feeling of a finger in your ass.  How do you get past that?  Well, first of all, before you do it, go in the bathroom, make sure and take a little  dump.  No, no, but it's not, but it's not about this. 
[02:25:00]  There's nothing in me.  I'm, I'm cleaned out.  So it's not like I feel shit coming.  I just have that feeling because my, my ass is not used to having anything in it.  Oh, because you didn't get the right person to do it right with you.  I don't know.  I mean, have her playing with your cock, stuck it on your dick a little bit, kind of  a little coochie coo.  So you're not just thinking about a finger just being in your butt.  To me, I find actually it's, it's better if you're playing with the guy's cock at the  same time while you, you know, she didn't do that.  You got the long nails though.  I don't know if that should be in the, yeah.  Wow.  In the shitter.  Oh, you use a dildo. 
[02:25:30]  Get a dildo and use it on them.  Oh, that's not bad.  I don't know if I, I want one of those fingers where the poopy comes out.  Oh, now I'd be like, Ooh, got to clean this crap.  Yeah.  Be like a cooch nail.  I'd go get a dildo.  You must have a nice technique if you could get those nails in someone's bunghole without  hurting them.  I'm being, I've actually hadn't done a guy anal in ages.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah.  That's, uh, that's not for me. 
[02:26:00]  I like it, you know?  So we got a book coming out that, we got a book coming out that you didn't write, but you  got a really good movie into the sunset that's coming out as well.  And you got sunsets, life.com.  How many, how many porn films there, uh, sunset?  About over 300.  That's it?  Yeah.  Not bad.  Um, for 18 years of being in the business, I've always been a contract girl.  And when you're a contract girl, you only shoot maybe about three to four movies a year.  Right.  And what I wanted to do is not overdo it. 
[02:26:30]  I mean, some of these girls get in here and do movies now and they just, it's overwhelming.  You wanted to save the clump.  Well, you tease them a little bit, you know?  Don't give them so much all at once.  You don't want to wear out the clump, you know?  It's not necessarily that.  It's just, come on, if you give them too much, it's kind of boring after a while.  You're more a promotional girl, you know?  You make a film and then you go out and go on the road.  Mm-hmm.  I go out on feature dance and stuff.  Feature dance, yeah.  And promote my movie and stuff like that.  Why did you decide to leave?  Were you sick of doing it? 
[02:27:00]  No, it's not that I was sick of doing it.  It's just, it's time for a change, you know?  And I'm getting more in the mainstream.  Does that have something to do with being married?  Nope.  Nothing to do with that.  I was married before when I first got into the business, so.  Your husband doesn't care if you go to a ranch or anything like that or the place you're  going to, the wild horse or the school?  Yeah, because he knew that's what I did when he got with me and this is what I want to do  and don't change me.  If you don't like it, don't be with me.  That's just my attitude.  I ask this question to all you gals that come in.  Where's the line where the husband gets jealous?  I'm so confused by that. 
[02:27:30]  There has to be something.  Like, I mean, men are, well, both sides are very jealous.  Like, you're having sex with other people, so what makes your husband jealous?  You know what I mean?  He doesn't get jealous, though.  But there's got to be something.  It might even be something, like, just silly.  The only thing that he would get jealous about is, like, say, if I was, go out right now  and go to a restaurant right now and maybe be in with a guy without making money from  him.  Holy shit.  You know, going on a date just as normal.  Right.  As long as there's money exchanged, he's fine with it. 
[02:28:00]  But if your real emotions were involved.  Well, that would be a bad like that.  If your real feelings were involved, he might get a little jealous.  Yeah, I mean, but we don't have that issue.  He never gets jealous.  Do you guys have any cheating issues?  I don't get jealous.  Yeah, what makes, oh, you don't get jealous at all?  Like, you can watch him.  Well, see, my first husband, we were swingers in our personal life.  But my husband and I have now, we're not swingers.  No, we don't swing or anything like that.  Every now and then, I'll bring a girl in or something.  But he doesn't get to bang...  Because I like watching this girl chick. 
[02:28:30]  Wait, you get to bang a lot of guys, but he doesn't get to bang other girls.  Huh?  You get to bang a lot of different guys, and he doesn't get to bang girls.  No, I just said...  No, she said...  But you said occasionally.  You didn't say a lot.  Well, it's something he wants to really do a whole lot.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I keep him busy enough, so, you know.  And you've got adult kids, too, right?  Yeah.  Wow.  How old?  I have a 19-year-old, which she goes to UNLV.  Do you have a 19-year-old?  She's in college.  She's my stepdaughter, though.  And where'd she go?  She goes to UNLV.  UNLV.  Nice.  Yeah, and then I have a 17-year-old son, which thinks he's gay. 
[02:29:00]  Wait, he thinks he's gay?  What do you mean, thinks he's gay?  He just...  Did you turn him off as far as pussy goes?  I did not either.  I did.  He just came up to me one day and goes,  Mom, I like guys.  And I'm like, whoa, but, you know, I can't shut him for what I do for a living.  So, I mean, come on.  Teach him how to suck a cock?  I ain't teach him how to suck a cock.  That's gross.  That would be something, wouldn't it?  That's fucking hilarious.  I would never do that.  No, no, no.  A lot of drool and now up and down on the shelf.  No, no, no, boy.  It's like this.  Oh, that is disgusting, guys. 
[02:29:30]  I could not do that.  We got your next project.  You want to sell some freaking...  Come on, one more movie.  One more movie.  Come on, my whole movie.  No, no, no.  My kids are not...  They're not in...  I mean, they're not against what I do, but they don't want to do that.  That's fucking hilarious.  They're not into what I'm going to do, pornos.  You're supportive as far as what he's doing?  I can't shut him for what he's doing.  I mean, come on.  I mean, just like he doesn't look down on me for what I do, so...  Holla.  True.  You know, so, you know.  You think he's just confused, or do you think he's really gay? 
[02:30:00]  I think he's...  I don't know.  He's to the stage now.  For a while there, he said he was confused, and now he just came up to me just recently  and goes, Mom, I'm gay.  I said, are you sure?  Because you've been, like, going up and down on this, kind of like, I like guys and girls.  And he goes, no, I'm gay.  Why don't you bring some of your friends home and really...  Yeah, exactly.  We're going to see how they're in shape.  I would not dare do that with my kid.  Are you nuts?  No, I'm not.  You're gross.  No.  Ew.  It's my son.  It's gross. 
[02:30:30]  You're not doing it with him.  You're having your friends do it.  Yeah.  It's almost like if his car was broken down and your friend was a mechanic.  Right.  You'd bring your friend home and say, teach this kid how to fix this fucking car.  He can find his own friends.  I ain't going to bring my friends.  Teach him how to fix the car because he keeps wrapping his lips around the exhaust pipe.  I knew you guys were going to give me a hard time on that one, man.  Not at all.  Hey, it's not my body's gay, okay?  We're just getting some laughs out.  Just getting some laughs out.  I mean, come on.  So let's talk more about the book you didn't write. 
[02:31:00]  I'm obsessed with that.  I did, too.  I'm obsessed with that.  She wrote the book.  Come on, Richard Bachman.  I want to know about this.  Who's the other guy?  Well, no.  Our Richard is my partner, and he's a publicist.  He's got a bunch of publicists and a lot of books out there.  James Fry.  Basically, we set together, and we write it together, you know?  He goes in details with me, and I tell him about things.  Do you got pictures in this book?  Yeah.  I got a lot of different things in the book.  No pictures?  Yes.  Like, you know, nudie stuff. 
[02:31:30]  Of course.  You sure?  Yes.  How many?  How many on top of my head?  Come on.  I just got done with the book.  I haven't gotten up all the pictures now is what I want to put inside the book.  Yeah.  And on the back of it, actually, I had Larry Flint write a little vlog for me.  Ron Jeremy did, and also Nina Hartley's last.  So it's really, yeah.  That's really cool.  Yeah.  Oh, well, what have we got here?  Oh, my God, you're so mean. 
[02:32:00]  Ant and I are both fans of old.  No, we're not being mean.  No, no, no.  You've got to focus.  Listen, you're on our side again.  Listen, we're fans of old school porn.  What happened to old school porn where you almost felt like it was a believable plot?  Where the guy, like the father would be somewhere.  Watching TV late at night.  The daughter, for some reason, who looks like a stripper, has her friends over.  And then one of them slips into the room, and the father's like, well, what have we got here?  Hi, what's your name? 
[02:32:30]  Shouldn't you be out at the party?  Oh, well, my, what are you doing?  Oh, Mr. Johnson.  And then, you know, it starts.  Well, I like about Into the Sunset.  It's got a good plot to it, good storyline to it and everything.  It's not just, if you mean, if you just want to watch sex, you can always just fast forward and just watch sex.  I like a good plot, good little story to it.  I don't need, I don't need, I don't need everyone naked within five seconds.  I totally agree.  I like it with a good plot, good story, just boom, boom, boom, boom. 
[02:33:00]  If I want that, I just fast forward it.  The 80s movies, like with the plots, like the old taboos and shit like that, but I like the fucking shaved vaginas of the fucking new millennium.  I like the hairy pussy.  Kay Parker was fantastic.  If she shaved her pussy, I'd fucking marry her.  But it was awful.  Fucking Juan Epstein's head.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was like digging in there.  A lot of people want to know how much to have sex with Sunset Thomas at the Wild Horse.  Yeah, that's a good question.  What is the, uh...  And do you have like a menu?  Well, I can't go in details.  I mean, you basically, you have to talk to me when you get out there and stuff. 
[02:33:30]  It just depends on certain things you want, you know.  Straight fuck.  I can't go in details on prices, so it's illegal.  All right.  You gotta talk about it at the brothel.  Can you get...  Let's not talk about you.  Let's talk about...  Let's guess, say a porn star of your fame and notoriety.  Somebody of your fame, what would you guess that it would be to have sex with them in a place where it's legal?  Well, I don't know.  That's a fair question.  Just a guess.  Each girl has different prices. 
[02:34:00]  Some might charge you $2,000.  Some might charge you $3,000.  You know, some might charge you $4,000.  It just depends on the girl.  So you charge $4,000.  I didn't say that.  Well, let's just say they charge $3,000 in the middle.  $3,000.  Because you're having sex with them and as well as their name.  They're famous.  Is there more for anal sex or is everything pretty much included in that?  That's a fair question.  Danny's fucking...  You got Mary Ann from Gilligan's Island sucking some cod.  That's what it looks like.  Well, I mean, it just depends on how much you pay for your party, how long you're there and stuff like that. 
[02:34:30]  And then, yeah, I mean, other things cost more, yeah.  I charge a little more for anal.  Do you?  Yeah.  Do you make the guy wear a bag?  But every now and then, if I get in such a really...  Of course, condoms always.  For oral sex, too?  What are those?  You got to be careful, dude.  Condoms for oral sex, though?  Well, you know, there's a little thin little plastic thing you can put on you, you know.  It tastes probably good.  How about if you're giving him oral sex?  I usually use a flavor condom.  Oh, you will?  Yeah.  How about if he has test results that are less than three years old? 
[02:35:00]  God.  And only herpes shows up.  No, no, no.  It's all condoms.  You got to use condoms out there.  It's illegal.  Is it illegal without condoms?  You got to use condoms.  She knows.  You get checked.  You have to see a doctor every week and stuff.  Why if you're using condoms?  You never know.  You still pick up the herpes or fucking HPV.  Those are pretty fucking...  Like that out there?  That's true.  I mean, you got to be careful, especially today.  You don't know what people's got. 
[02:35:30]  Those girls are probably, in a lot of ways, cleaner because they make you wear bags a lot  of times for blowjobs.  What if the younger you picked up a communicable disease and then the older you, then the older  you, would you have it then all of a sudden?  Untreated?  Like syphilis for 25 years?  Right.  All of a sudden, would you just deteriorate in front of you?  The younger me would never get it because the older me would teach her how not to get  it.  Ah, all right.  Okay.  Is that a plot in the book?  No.  No.  Of course it's not. 
[02:36:00]  That's a good question, though.  But again, the older her was a terrific question.  Hopefully get the younger you before the younger you caught.  Well, the younger me won't catch it.  Syphilis or gonorrhea or chlamydia.  Are you nervous?  No.  No.  Are we bothering you?  It's old school porn.  Yeah, look at old school porn.  You can see it.  Hey, doll, I love you.  Oh, wow.  Take off your big panties and let me fuck you.  Why do they all have saggy butts back then?  Yeah, that is a saggy butt. 
[02:36:30]  Look at these lovely tits.  They're like my little boobies.  Oh, what is she doing?  She's awful.  She has a horrible body vest, though.  Wow, Stumson has great tits.  Wow, these are great.  Marge, you want to feel them?  No, thank you.  No.  It actually looks like she doesn't know what the hell she's doing.  Can I look at you from the front there?  Yeah.  Holy mackerel, those are just fantastic.  That's a good boob job.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Amazing.  I want to photograph those if I could.  Go ahead.  You can take a picture.  With my iPhone. 
[02:37:00]  Let me scoot this down for a minute.  All right, I like that.  Okay.  Can you move your headphone thing?  It's the little string.  Yeah, we can't have the string in the way, right?  It plugs into the wall this woman's using.  It's old school porno.  Dude, it's a dildo that's plugged in.  Oh, my God.  In her big, hairy.  That's crazy.  It's plugged into the wall with a big wire that, like, a lamp.  Oh, my God.  That you use on a lamp.  Is that the days before they had batteries or something?  Yeah.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  Couldn't figure that out.  Yeah.  Ah, that's 69, dear. 
[02:37:30]  He's just getting a mouthful of fucking hair.  God, they didn't even know how to 69 back there.  Look, they're not moving.  There's nothing going on.  You know, I hate that when they lay there like a dead fish, don't you?  It looks like a pile of corpses.  She's trying to jack them off.  He's not moving.  Ah, this bitch.  You don't even know how to jack them off.  Old porno dick.  The title of this picture, by the way, is Great Tits and Retarded Denny.  Look at Denny in the room.  Oh, look at this.  What is that?  Look at this fucking...  What is he doing? 
[02:38:00]  I don't know.  He's fucking her sideways, but...  They are awful looking.  Oh, look at her.  It's Pat Barrington.  Yes.  The art of vivacious looking blah.  Look at her.  As she rides the cock...  The guy's got his socks on.  The angle's the worst.  They show from the fucking...  Where the two heads are, and they don't put the camera where the fucking box is.  No, you can't.  The camera's probably fucking three tons.  And guys never wear socks when they have sex.  They're tennis socks.  No.  Guys always want to take their socks on.  This chick looks like Susan Boyle. 
[02:38:30]  She kind of does.  This guy has psoriasis of the feet.  He has to wear socks.  He's got eggs in the back.  Oh, look at how they used to do doggy style back then.  Ah, little doggy style.  What is this called?  She fucked a guy from Auschwitz?  This is the...  I know.  Look at this guy.  Jesus.  Weighs 90 pounds.  Eat a burger.  Old porno stinks.  Yeah, it sucks.  They sure learned as the years went by.  All right.  We should take a break, I'm thinking. 
[02:39:00]  Righty.  Yeah.  We learned a lot.  We learned a lot today.  I think so.  The book, the last movie, the fucking fan that had the small dick.  The son.  Yeah.  The daughter.  The son, the daughter, right.  Stepdaughter.  And if you want to find out more about the book, all you have to do is go to anatomyadultfilm.com.  Of course.  So let's say, what's the second thing you love doing in life?  Number one would be porno, let's say. 
[02:39:30]  Well, of course, yeah.  What's number two on your list?  Actually, I love to ride horses.  Have you ever combined the two hobbies?  No, I don't have sex with animals.  But that, I mean, that's something fun I like to do.  I love boxing.  Boxing's my favorite.  Mars, you want to spar?  It's my favorite, favorite sport.  Really?  I love boxing, yeah.  Aren't you worried about taking a hit to the old mug there?  I mean, I don't box.  I actually write for doghouse.com right now.  You know how to?  Oh, you go to the ranch and stuff. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, I thought you got in there and sparred around.  Yeah, I do interviews with them and everything like that.  You ever get a guy that wants to box your boobs?  You want it with her cock?  Chuck Farnham met a girl.  He's an old friend of ours.  Her thing was she needed her boobs punched really hard.  And he did it.  Really?  And she would get more and more turned on when the bruises showed up like a day or two later.  For real.  This is a real story.  Really? 
[02:40:30]  Mm-hmm.  I like my ass being smacked when I'm on my boobs.  Is it bad that I...  Or my, like, are right on my clit, you know?  Could Jimmy spank you?  Jimmy is the best spanker in house.  Right like that on the clit.  I don't know who's a good spanker.  Could Jimmy spank you?  You want to spank me, baby?  I'll try it.  All right, here.  Hang on.  And rate Jimmy spank you.  What, do you want to spank the front or the back?  No, your ass, not your vagina.  Your ass, not your vagina.  Sam?  Can I lift this up a little?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right, get a mic on Sunset.  Jimmy has good technique.  Okay, here.  Mars. 
[02:41:00]  He sounds videotaping?  Yeah, of course Mars has to be right there.  You ready?  Got to make sure the mic works, right, Mars?  Okay.  Don't kill me now.  Okay, Mars.  Jimmy, let me teach you how to spank.  I retarded, I retarded.  All right, Jimmy, bend over.  She's going to spank you.  Retarded, stiff arm.  Jimmy's pulling his pants back.  Oh my God, I showered after my last.  You're so cute, bud.  I showered after my last dump.  Hang on, now you do a little rubbing like this first.  You got to rub the butt first?  I hope piss shit comes out all over her hand. 
[02:41:30]  By the way.  I hope you piss shit.  You probably want to tell her.  Ow.  Now do the other cheek.  Did that hurt?  Yeah, do the other cheek.  Stuck the heart.  How great did that make?  Ow.  Yeah.  Good?  She was great there.  Yeah.  Oh.  That hurts a little.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  I'm afraid.  I got a bottle of water.  I can stick it up your ass.  Oh, dang.  Wow, wait. 
[02:42:00]  All right, let it be known.  And E-Rock came in and slammed into my chair.  Of course.  Everyone else has.  Yeah.  You fucking buffalo.  Hey, Sunset.  Oh, we just hit it again now out of spite.  Before we take a break, give the guys out there one tip.  Okay.  On how to satisfy their ladies.  I don't know, anything.  Any type of little tip.  Don't rush into it, you know.  Take your time.  Be romantic with your girl.  Now I was getting more details.  All right.  All right.  You know, get down there.  Eat that pussy a little bit.  Let her get off that way first, you know. 
[02:42:30]  And then slowly go in, you know, instead of screwing her so fast.  Come stuck a little bit and move that thing.  Jimmy has the best licking pussy technique.  Jimmy, do you want to show her?  Yeah, I'll just watch this.  Get right on the clip.  No, watch.  I open up like that and I go,  Blah!  See, you're so bad.  What, that's bad?  That's bad?  Well, it depends on that.  Well, I don't know how good it can.  Here's how it's sad if we did a porno. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  Okay, this is the sound of porno.  Just moan a little bit and say,  Oh, come on, baby.  You know, they can't.  Oh, yeah, baby.  Blah!  Oh, yeah.  It's my pussy.  Blah!  Here, let me see your fingers.  Blah!  This is how you really eat pussy, all right?  Imagine if you were a girl and you got a clip.  You're going to eat Jimmy's pussy?  Well, I'm just saying.  He's licking my hand.  All right.  Yeah, let's make believe that's the pussy, right?  What is she doing, Jimmy?  Oh, yeah.  She's doing what I would normally do, which is she's flicking her tongue on my knuckle. 
[02:43:30]  The gentle suction-y thing with the lip.  She's very good.  Yeah, with a little tooth scraping.  I love it.  But not too much.  I got my bottom sped.  You certainly did, and you were going, ow!  Ow!  Yeah, I know.  I got a little pussy.  Sincere.  I'm kidding.  He's got a little hairless bottom, Jimmy.  I've seen it many times walking out of the bathroom.  He spreads his ass cheeks and will bend over, and when you walk out of the bathroom stall,  all you see is his butthole.  Jimmy, you want to show some side your butthole? 
[02:44:00]  No, because I'm afraid if I bend forward, I'll work with a tube of toothpaste, and chocolatey  liquid toothpaste will fucking, I'm afraid I'll become a fucking home-right paint stick.  They're saying you've got to go, and we have to take a break.  Thank you for having me.  So, oh, you were good.  Well, good luck.  Let's see.  We've got the book that no one's going to read, but we have the movie Into the Sunset. 
[02:44:30]  Come on, the book is awesome.  You're going to love it.  The book is awesome.  What's the book's name again for the readers out there?  Anatomy of an Adult Film.  All right.  And it's fiction.  All right, and then you've got Into the Sunset, the last movie.  I don't think it's the last movie.  You're smart, though.  It's like the farewell tour that The Who did and Kiss did.  No, it is.  It's my final movie.  And then you come back in a couple of years for the big reunion thing.  Nope, nope.  I am still working at the bar.  And then you've got The Wild Horse, I think, coming soon.  Coming soon.  And the website sunsetslife.com. 
[02:45:00]  She's always been a friend of the show for many years, Ed.  Many years.  Oh, I know.  I remember.  Long, long time.  You're moaning I made one of our CDs.  Okay.  Thank you.  Okay.  All righty, then.  Our friend Sunset Thomas.  We're going to take a break, everyone.  And Brie Olson joins the program next.  You know what?  She's hot.  Do you know Brie?  No, I don't know her, but she's hot.  I saw her in the room over there.  Would you do her?  Oh, hell yeah, I would do her.  How would you do her?  I would spank her little ass first. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, I don't know about that.  Make her bed.  Say, hmm, yes, I'm going to go down and eat my pussy.  Oh.  That's right.  You finger the ass.  I get to finger right by the ass and I go like this.  No, I'd stick my finger in her pussy first.  Let's get some shit going today.  What do you say, man?  That's the sound I make when I finger the ass.  I make like a rat face and I go.  I do it angry. 
[02:46:00]  I don't even start at the butthole.  I start six inches away from the body and I aim and jam.  Have you ever done an anal with a dick?  My health doesn't allow it.  Have I ever what?  Have you ever done anal with a chick? 
[02:46:30]  Oh, yeah.  What do you think?  After a few years, I'm like, I might as well try it with a girl.  I might as well try it with a girl.  Well, bring your son.  No!  Oh, no way!  That was...  You're going to take that.  That was a bad shot there.  This is where I'm coming to.  That was funny.  No way.  That was a good one.  All right, we should take it.  Yes, we should.  And I have to tinkle?  Ah.  Yeah, want to all pee together?  Yeah? 
[02:47:00]  We're all going to pee together.  You could make whizzies on Jimmy.  Would you whizzy on Jimmy?  Would I whizzy on Jimmy?  I don't go for that.  No, I'm not into that kind of stuff either.  You could sit next to him in the stall and make a sound that goes...  Like girl pee-pee.  When guys piss, it's like, you know, that waterfall sound.  And girls make whee-wees.  It goes...  And it goes...  And then they squish out a little more.  Guys do the same thing, too, though.  Yeah, but guys...  No, no, no.  Guys have a different sound. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  It's from altitude.  You know, you get the...  Yeah, we get the rain drops.  Glow, glow, rain droppy sound.  A little rain droppy sound.  Girls, though, it's like fucking turbo.  I'm amazed you know how it ends.  Yeah.  I never knew that.  Yeah.  Well, it does.  They squish a little out.  But it's always turbocharged.  It's amazing.  What's going on?  Girls in your vaginas.  A lot of shit going on down there.  A lot of shit going on down there.  A lot of fucking everything compacted into one little area.  A clit, the urethra, vulva. 
[02:48:00]  What other vagina parts we got there?  It's like...  It's like a...  Labio.  It's like a...  It's like a...  It's like pouring a Guinness right in.  How much pressure is...  Yeah, yeah.  It's like 1,800 pounds of pressure.  Yeah.  Guys are like bud taps.  And women piss like Guinness taps.  Nice foamy head.  Yeah.  Hey, you know, it's something like that in the morning taking a nice shower.  That piss in the shower. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, I thought you were saying nice shit.  Oh, yeah.  You piss in the shower about the shit in the shower.  No, the piss in the shower.  Shit in the shower.  Wow.  I went shit in the shower.  Talk about that piss in the shower.  Have you ever...  You know, like a shower piss?  That morning piss.  Yeah.  You know, in the shower.  It's awesome.  I love it.  Especially if you eat asparagus the night before.  I love a good asparagus piss.  Oh, my God.  Is there anything better?  It frightens me.  Before I remember, I ate it.  You know, because you smell it and you go, what's more wrong with me?  I got a disease.  And then you realize it was just asparagus.  No disease for Sunset.  Let's make sure.  No, no. 
[02:49:00]  Of course not.  Okay.  No.  I think we did a lot of stuff here today.  Yeah, we did.  Thank you guys for having me.  Thank you, Sunset.  Thank you.  Take a little break-a-rooney.  Yeah.  Because I like to say break-a-rooney.  Maybe we get something going with you and Brie Olson.  I don't know.  We'll see.  Or you got somewhere else to go.  Well, I don't know.  We'll see.  What does that mean?  Well, I can't answer for her.  We got a twofer.  It's twofer Tuesday, right?  Isn't it Tuesday? 
[02:49:30]  We got our old friend Brie Thomas.  Not old in that way.  You know.  What did I just say?  I said Thomas and Brie said Brie Thomas.  Brie Thomas?  Really?  Yeah, we just had Sunset in.  Sorry.  Yeah, we just had Sunset in.  We got Brie Olson, our friend Brie, in studio.  And we were just talking to her about the Bubba the Love Sponge incident because our fans lost their shit when they found out about what happened on Bubba's show.  What exactly was it?  I mean, you kind of were touching on it during the break.  Because the first I heard of it was today in the prep sheet. 
[02:50:00]  Right.  Like, when was it?  And, well, you were in Florida?  What happened?  Yeah, she was pretty much telling us during the break.  But just start over for the audience.  Yeah.  If you want to go down this road.  No, it's fine.  But I do have a comment about the whole thing that I do want to make after you tell your story.  Okay, well, a few weeks ago I was down in Florida and I knew I was going to be going on the Bubba show for a while.  So they prepped me and said I was going to be giving a blind listener a handjob.  So I get there at the studio and I'm talking with them for about half an hour before they introduce me to this quote-unquote blind man. 
[02:50:30]  They bring him in and he's using some type of camera equipment as a walking stick and is rocking a pair of Ray-Ban sunglasses.  Now, I don't know many blind people, but I don't think they're usually wearing Ray-Ban sunglasses.  So I'm like, okay, this is, he's totally not blind, guys.  You know, ha-ha, that was a funny joke.  Now what?  And they just kept on with it.  And they kept on for another half an hour. 
[02:51:00]  And finally I went to a break and I was like, okay, you know, you guys were putting it on for air.  Now tell me, you know, what's going on?  What's the game plan?  What are we going to do?  They're like, no, he really is blind.  Well, you know, it made me upset and not upset in an angry way.  My feelings were just more hurt than anything.  And I was really.  That they were treating you like an idiot.  Yeah.  And I was just confused about what they were, what they're, what they were trying to do, basically.  So.  Thought they were setting up for something.  Yeah.  It was like, what are their motives here?  Right.  So I went outside and I was crying, just minding my business. 
[02:51:30]  I wasn't talking to anyone.  I wasn't yelling, screaming, anything.  And they just keep this camera in my face.  And they continue this.  I go off their property thinking they're not going to follow me anymore.  And then I start walking down the street and they just keep on following me.  They follow me for about a mile down the road.  And about 10 minutes after them taping me, crying, then I finally snap on them.  Of course, they don't show anything else except for the point where I finally grab the camera. 
[02:52:00]  And that's why I'm saying, give me the tape.  Because, you know, it's just 10 minutes of footage of me crying.  Why would they want that?  So.  That sucks.  Because Bree, what are you doing?  Photographing her foot.  Nothing, nothing dirty.  Just take a picture of her foot.  You like the foot?  I'm not a foot guy.  Jimmy, Jimmy's so distracting over here.  I keep on looking over at him like.  I'm sorry.  I'm photographing her foot because she has really very pretty feet.  And I'm looking at going like, because I'm looking at her feet going, well, they're really nice feet.  If I had a foot fetish, I just noticed. 
[02:52:30]  Like, when I notice feet, they're nice.  Let me see the picture.  Oh.  It's like somebody wants to see some foot.  They're nicely fucking painted.  Are you a Tootsie?  You're not a Tootsie guy, are you?  No, I always said it's part of the whole package.  So, if there's a cute foot on, you know, if there's a cute foot on that mess from that English American Idol, I'm not going to fucking look and go, oh, wow, that's a cute foot, you know?  You have to have a foot fetish.  I guess what I don't understand about the story, like, if you do just a little research on Brie Olsen, she's really cool. 
[02:53:00]  Very cool.  And pretty much down for anything and could do the hang.  So, for him to go down that road is kind of confusing.  Yeah, because she's not like, there are girls that come in and are too sensitive.  Yeah, and I told Brie, I'm like, I'm not going to lie to you.  We've had porn stars cry on our show, but I think it's happened twice, and it's always something where we bring up something, and it was a soft, like, a sensitive topic for the porn, sorry, I say porn star, adult film star, whatever, and they lose it. 
[02:53:30]  And we're in shock, like, wow, our intention wasn't to make her cry, but obviously that was the hillbilly's intention.  Yeah, it was just, he was going to go with the bit no matter what, regardless of how cool the girl was.  That's the problem.  And because Brie is really cool, it's like, you don't expect that.  You expect to get some weird, flaky attitude, but when you don't get it, you should adjust and just be honest.  Yeah, Brie's done everything we've asked of her on our show.  Yeah.  She's done some crazy shit for us over the years.  Like, Brie Olsen, like that, like that. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, she's, and I'm not just saying that because we intend on being married.  I'm just saying that because, what, what's wrong with that?  I don't know, whatever it happens, whenever she, uh.  Yeah, you're a little smitten.  Is there still a little thing between you two?  Like, I know last time we talked, there was a little crush thing that's happening between you two.  You know, I told Jimmy, don't forget the little people, you know, because, um, I love Jimmy.  I don't know what's going on on his end, but.  Well, I happen to love Brie, so I think that all we need now is somebody 
[02:54:30]  with the, with the right to, uh, conduct a ceremony and to get in here.  Immediately.  And then we can do it, and I can be stalker husband and follow her all over and go, who  is that?  Who are you talking to?  Who is that?  I would love that.  I would love for Mr. Norton to stalk me.  She would be so sick of my shenanigans.  Wow.  Oh, would she be tired of me quickly?  Well, you should shenanigan a little.  We'd be together.  I say, I'd give it a month before we were laying around and she goes, you know, there's a gym  downstairs, right?  Oh, you think? 
[02:55:00]  No.  But she would be nice about it, but she would start showing little hints.  No, that's not true.  You know, I'd see Cialis laying around.  You're perfect the way you are.  Wow.  We're going to have children again.  I want people to understand, she's not playing this up for the radio.  There's a real crush that has happened.  No, you two, uh.  It has been there for a while now.  We like each other very much.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You ever fuck?  I like each other.  We're very, uh, get along very well.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Just wondering.  Sounds nice. 
[02:55:30]  Wow.  Alien.  I've never seen an adult film star blush so much.  You've never seen two people.  You've never seen two people want to yell opposing answers.  Wow, is Anthony on to something?  All right.  Just leave it on to those two.  I'm not going to interrogate.  I just threw a question out there.  It's a very good question.  Yeah.  On the questioning.  We'll have you.  I'll be that guy. 
[02:56:00]  We'll have you.  Well, since it's out there.  We'll answer the question.  That's very nice.  It's a cute, cute couple.  Yeah.  Have you ever given her flowers?  How's that?  I wish.  Jimmy, give her some flowers.  I would be happy to give her flowers.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy.  You cad.  I don't have a mailing address for her.  And I don't know.  Like, I would send them to you.  But I don't know.  She's living with somebody that's going to get mad.  You know?  I don't know the situation.  I live by myself.  You can come live with me if you want to.  Oh.  I would rather move you out here, though. 
[02:56:30]  I have to be here for radio.  Okay.  She would move.  All right.  Done deal.  I think, I think, I personally think that she should come out here and live.  I think that she should live here.  Oh, they're holding hands now.  What's wrong with that?  There's only two people holding hands on the radio.  It's perfectly acceptable.  Come out from where, Sheila?  Indiana.  Indiana.  Indiana, right.  Yeah.  Indiana.  Would you actually relocate to New York?  I would love to live in New York.  Really?  If I were to move to one place, it would be New York.  Really?  Yes.  Do you like the city or the suburbs? 
[02:57:00]  Well, I like the city.  I stay in the suburbs now.  It's going to happen, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know if I could make a permanent move out here, but I'd like to come out and  try it for like a year or so.  We can be, as they say, by coast.  Can I take a picture?  In a small, stuffy apartment, or wouldn't you like something a little more sprawling out on  Long Island?  Oh, I see what you're doing.  I like how you think, Ann.  Can I get a picture of the happy couple for my town, please?  I mean, and really ham it up there. 
[02:57:30]  Ham it up.  I'm getting, hold on.  I'm going all in.  Yes.  Jimmy's hamming it up in his pants.  I certainly am.  You've got to be this way, because I don't like it.  Oh, getting a little rod, Jimmy?  You've got to take the other.  I want to, I want to, like a prom picture.  Aw, that's adorable.  Those two are so cute together.  Obie's phone makes a click like it's a real shutter.  Yeah, but this is, yes.  I want to, I want to see Beauty and the Retard.  I really want to see this photo.  Well, thank you for labeling my picture for me. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, shit.  Jimmy didn't even hear that.  Easy enough to write that text in there.  You know, I just got permission, so.  E-Rock took a great picture of Brie and I, but in the back, there's a black convict on  television, and it looks like fucking, ah!  Oh, that's fantastic.  The horrible thing is he gets second prize in high school.  You're a guy?  Hey, yeah.  Here's my pick of Beauty and, how do you spell retard? 
[02:58:30]  And the Beauty and the Retard.  R-E-T-A-R-T-E.  Here's my pick of Beauty and the Retard and Santa, everybody on Twitter.  How do you spell retard?  R-E-T-A-R-D.  Oh, you did spell it right.  I was hoping to spell it.  Yeah, I know how to spell it.  That's one of my strengths.  Be a fucking retard.  You're a goddamn retard.  Retard.  We'll be radio on Twitter.  So Bubba made you, ah, they kind of treated you bad just probably because they wanted, 
[02:59:00]  that was like something done just to kind of be like, let's be shocking and outrageous  and let's just be.  Yes, of course.  He stinks.  There's no reason to do that.  And he knows he stinks.  He's a hillbilly.  What do you have to say about that?  You told the story, but now, you know, what do you have to say to Bubba?  I don't hold anything against them.  Really?  You're not mad?  VoteBree.com. 
[02:59:30]  What's that about?  Yeah, what's, oh yeah, you sent me a text about voting for something.  What exactly?  What is VoteBree.com?  VoteBree.com is a contest that I'm in for twisties treat of the year.  And right now I'm in the lead and I hope to.  What's a twisty?  Do you say it that way?  Twisties.  It's a really cute website.

[03:00:00]  What have we got here?  Hey, twisties.  What is it?  Twisties.com might become my new favorite website.  So those are, so it's VoteBree.com?  VoteBree.com.  Well, why don't we vote for the chicken second place to make it more interesting?  Oh my gosh.  Oh my gosh.  Jesus.  Shut up.  You know who else is on this list?  Who?  Oh, Danny.  I just noticed that our favorite Shauna Lanay is on this list.  Oh no.  With a whopping 496 votes.  Is Brie kicking the shit out of her? 
[03:00:30]  Yes.  Ten times as many votes.  It's all VoteBree.  VoteBree.  Thank you.  Is it VoteBree.com you said?  VoteBree.com.  VoteBree.com.  Okay.  Yeah, we'll do that.  Thank you.  What do you win?  A lot of good stuff.  But, one of the things about it is that I'm donating a portion of my winnings to the SPCA.  So you're going to be helping out the little furry friends.  Little animals?  Whoa.  Who's boobs are that?  Speaking of little animals.  Those yours?  Yeah, that's her breast award.  How do you know, Jimmy?  I've seen photos.  I mean, I've seen photos. 
[03:01:00]  I would never.  I would never.  I'm going to worship them.  Right.  Would you worship them, Jimmy?  Yeah.  How would you worship them?  I guess.  I would hold them.  I would make this noise.  Oh.  Oh.  I love his facial expression with his hair.  Aren't they great?  Could you ask Bree to speculate that if we ever did sleep together?  Yeah.  Let's just say we ever did.  Yeah.  Does she think that I would get a good report?  Not an amazing report.  Oh, okay. 
[03:01:30]  Not like a professional report, but like a...  Based on what you know about Jimmy.  As a person.  Yeah, just sitting here, talking with him, things like that.  And perhaps, I don't know, whatever texts you guys trade or whatever private moments you've had.  Um, how would you, uh, uh, judge Jimmy, rate him, uh, as a lover?  10.  Out of?  100?  300.  What?  A 10.  Out of 22.  No.  Very, very attentive.  What did Jimmy do well if, if he... 
[03:02:00]  If he were to have done something well, what would it have been?  Yeah.  Um...  What were you impressed with, if this went down?  If it would have happened?  Um, I think that we're just really, we're both really just kinky people.  Translate.  We're into the same...  He buried his tongue up our ass.  Buried.  Buried.  I would never, ever say something as crass as that on the radio.  I know.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  Although, it sounds like it would be a really wonderful thing to do. 
[03:02:30]  I wouldn't doubt it.  It's going to be many years of that to come, I'm sure.  A man cannot be a real man unless he eats ass.  Words to live by Don Corleone.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We got to ask her about the big movie, Bree's Big Camp Out.  Yeah, we were speculating what this could possibly be, Bree's Big Camp Out.  It almost sounds like an Ernest movie.  I loved those. 
[03:03:00]  What is this about?  It's basically me and my little girlfriends out camping and we all get laid.  Oh.  You all get laid.  Do you run into some other campers?  Yeah.  The boys camp?  Is that what happens?  Across the lake?  Yeah.  How do you run into the guys camping?  Gosh.  I don't remember, Dave.  It's something.  I don't know.  And then I was fucking and it was a canoe.  My goal is to marry Bree and then just ruin her porn career by directing these but really 
[03:03:30]  artsy.  Like, no, no, you don't get it.  You don't fuck.  The problem is that everybody has to shit.  There's only one toilet.  Go with it.  That would ruin the career, all right.  It sure would.  But one of the things about Bree's big camp out is that if you go to adamandeve.com and  you enter the code word Bree, then you get 50% off that movie and anything else at adamandeve.com.  Yeah, we like adamandeve.com.  You look very sexy on this box cover.  Bree's.  Beach party.  You got the camp out. 
[03:04:00]  We're the very act of life.  Yeah.  There's my copies.  What happened?  It's weird because you're almost like...  There's some around.  I want Down and Dirty.  Okay.  She also has...  She's called Down and Dirty.  She has a DVD called Down and Dirty and, you know, Jimmy has one called Down and Dirty.  Well, my show is Down and Dirty with Jim Norton, so this is Down and Dirty with Bree Olsen.  I like that.  Do I want one last ride?  I'm sure yours is better.  Yeah, I want one last ride.  Oh, why are the cocks pixelated?  I did.  Sorry, I was channeling Steve. 
[03:04:30]  So, I've asked...  We asked girls this before.  Like, when you're having sex in real life, does it make it harder, like, you know, because  you're fucking professional guys.  Like, you know, guys that are good fucks, let's be honest.  I mean, guys in movies, to me, are amazing.  They're in amazing shape.  They have genitals.  Like oil derricks.  They just keep going.  They really are.  Chuk-kung, chuk-kung, chuk-kung.  They don't stop.  Yeah.  It's like, how do you, like, when you hook up with a regular guy, how do you not laugh  at him?  How do you not laugh at a regular guy? 
[03:05:00]  I don't know.  That's trying to impress you with a sexual prowess when you, on the other hand, have been  with professionals that are really kind of good at what they do.  Jim is wondering what your acting skills are all about.  Yeah, I don't, I don't know.  Why don't you tell us, Jimmy?  Well, oh, Jimmy.  Oh.  Um, no.  Look at Jimmy's face.  A little red.  That's funny.  No.  Oh.  It's, I mean, I love having sex with, you know, guys off camera just as much as on camera. 
[03:05:30]  They're great.  I love them.  Um, I don't discriminate whatsoever, but I think it's awesome.  Is it harder to enjoy, like, a regular person, like, a regular guy?  Not at all.  No?  Not at all.  It doesn't affect it whatsoever.  Holy Jesus.  I mean, sometimes in, what are you guys watching?  Yeah, what are you looking at?  Watching you be face fucked.  Hey, Danny, can you turn the monitor, please?  Jesus.  Wow.  Is that a good one?  We were just watching, um, oh, Jesus. 
[03:06:00]  Holy mother.  I almost blurted out lucky girl.  He's giving oral sexes.  Some, somebody.  Wow.  That's got to hurt, that whole gag thing.  No.  No?  That old gag.  That's very, very hot.  Yeah.  See, she's not uncomfortable watching the movie.  It's good.  Now I can't concentrate because I'm watching myself blow someone.  But do you critique your own work?  Like, when I listen to the radio show, I'm like, oh, man.  God, that was a hack line I threw out there, or this or that. 
[03:06:30]  Do you like?  Yeah, sure.  Sure I do.  And what do you look for when you're looking at this scene, let's say?  Yeah, what bothers you or what do you like?  Yeah, do you go, oh, my hair looks a little weird?  What do you do?  No, I never really worry about how I look because I think the more fucked up I look.  Yeah, I can say that on the radio.  Oh, you certainly can.  I had to think.  I'm like, shoot, I'm not a terrestrial.  Okay.  But the more fucked up I look, the better because that means it's a great scene.  It's just more the things that I say and stuff like that.  Like, my friend was like, he was joking about something, and he was like, yeah, I painted 
[03:07:00]  a map of Hawaii on her with my cum.  And I'm like, oh, my gosh, I'm so going to say that in the next movie I do.  I promise you, and I'm going to hand you a copy.  I just love saying random stuff, you know, in my movies.  But, you know, I'm always looking for new creative things to say.  You look good.  I don't know.  Thank you.  We're going to come up with some new stuff she could say.  Yes.  How about this?  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Okay, Jim.  I'm sure this will be some.  Let me get my pen and paper ready.  Let me think.  Wow.  Yeah, Jimmy's a great writer. 
[03:07:30]  You have one of those very, like Jimmy likes those, very meaty vagina.  Very thick, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Very nice.  Yeah.  Beautiful, yeah.  And you've got the hair going on.  Is the hair coming back?  Well, I just do it every once in a while, you know.  We'll mess it up.  Just a little bit.  I don't have any right now, but.  No?  No.  Jimmy?  Besides a five o'clock shadow.  Would she, would, Jimmy, if you said, would she make those faces in bed if you were to  have had sex with her, perhaps?  The face she's making right now is one of pure ecstasy, and there is, there is no pity 
[03:08:00]  in it.  So I imagine she would not be making that face if she was in bed with me.  It would be, it would be, it would be the look, it would be the look of one friend who  is helping an erring friend.  Okay.  That's right.  I imagine that would be the look.  Sure.  As if she was trying to teach me to throw a football, and I kept dropping it behind me.  Oh, okay.  You would have, because it does seem a little odd, like that you can enjoy just, you know, 
[03:08:30]  having sex, casual sex without being paid, or, you know, a movie or something like that.  Just kind of, a guy.  That seems odd.  Yeah, yeah.  That would have sex without getting paid?  No, no, no, I didn't mean it that way.  That really came out wrong, didn't it?  No, I mean, without...  Probably the love Nazi.  I invented not the professional sense, where you're, you know, here's this guy, it's jackhammering  you over here. 
[03:09:00]  Right.  And then I can't imagine, like, maybe a tender moment of slow fucking and kissing, and, yeah.  Oh, I love that, though.  Yeah?  I love all different types of sex.  I don't discriminate on any type of sex whatsoever.  All right.  You're a good egg.  There's got to be one thing you're like, oh.  Yeah, is there anything you don't like?  That you like, that, like, guys will want to do in a movie or in a movie, and you're like,  eh, it's not your favorite?  Right.  Oh, I don't like that position.  No, never mind, not that position.  I don't like reverse.  See, that's regular.  Reverse cowgirl?  Yeah. 
[03:09:30]  That's regular.  You don't like reverse, where the guy can lay on his back and look at your ass while you're riding  the cock?  No.  No?  I don't like a lot of the ways that I have to do it, and, well, I mean, I like all sex,  but on camera.  That looks a little inconvenient for you.  Yeah, it's just, you know, it's not the most comfortable positions.  You know, I'm really easy in my personal life.  It's like missionary, doggy, and, you know, sometimes cowgirl.  A lot of good kissing, I think, very important to be able to kiss compatibly.  Yeah.  You have to kiss compatibly with a person. 
[03:10:00]  I mean, it is, huh?  You have to.  You absolutely have to, yeah.  You wrap your legs?  And missionary, you get your legs wrapped around that really now?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  Yeah, who wouldn't like that?  The log wall.  I'm getting so turned on right now.  Jesus Christ.  What do you want to do about that?  You would want Bree's beautiful legs.  Right.  Around you.  Wrapped around you, yeah.  There's something very close about that.  Feel her, like, feet, like, spurring you almost.  Yeah.  That's good shit.  And then if you say, like, you know, like, I feel like I might come soon.  Yeah.  And then you feel the legs tighten around your back. 
[03:10:30]  That's a very close moment.  And she says, we've only been doing this 30 seconds.  And you say, I meant come for the second time.  Because I came in the driveway, walking up the steps.  Start shuddering in the stairs.  When I rang a bell, I shot all over my ankles.  Oh, shit.  But yeah, I imagine, like, most turn-ons are from the neck up.  I mean, you know what I mean? 
[03:11:00]  It's those little things that make things feel sexy.  So, yeah, I imagine it's the same for how long do you like your single session to last?  Unless you're going for, you know, an all-nighter where your guy gets ready again and just starts fucking.  Or doesn't stop and keeps fucking.  Like, how long is, you know, before it gets like, all right, already come, motherfucker?  It really depends.  Half an hour is probably perfect.  Yeah.  Yeah, because sometimes guys think, you know, I'm going to fuck for, like, hours. 
[03:11:30]  And then, you know, the girl's like, hey, it's just, you know, hurting after a while.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think my favorite is, like, if you're just home with someone all day and, like, you have  sex for half an hour and then you wait a few hours and then have sex again.  Like, just have sex on and off all day.  That's so sexy.  And in the meantime, you just shut the fuck up.  It's great.  I'm teasing.  She's looking at me like, oh, my wife.  See, it's in between the fucking.  What are you doing to Jimmy's girlfriend? 
[03:12:00]  There's a little joke, a little humor.  I'm so lost right now.  No.  Yeah, we're watching a very sexy scene of Brie.  She's riding a guy.  Oh, shit.  I could never fuck like that.  He just went into high gear.  He's pumping his hips at a very rapid rate of speed.  Unbelievable.  Right.  They're having anal sex and she's on top of him.  It almost looks uncomfortable.  At least that's what regular men tell ourselves.  Boy, that doesn't look fun.  I hope.  You know. 
[03:12:30]  That's what guys say when we watch porn.  It's like, oh, she must hate that.  Oh, yeah.  That's in your ass.  Wow.  I love it.  Yeah.  Love it.  I guess she loves it.  Yeah.  That's got to hurt like, well, not that part.  But you're resting on your arms.  You've got to kind of, you know, have some upper body strength to hold yourself up like  that for a while, huh?  No.  I was about 10 pounds lighter in that video. 
[03:13:00]  And that's why.  Because I was doing sex workouts like that.  Oh, yeah?  Now I don't have to work as hard.  You look the same size.  Yeah.  You look great.  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  No, I'm not.  Are you wearing, are you wearing, because she's wearing a dress that looks like, you  get down a fighting weight for these videos?  You get down a fighting weight for the videos?  You lose a few pounds before you go on film?  No.  Shoot.  No.  I'll eat a cheeseburger right before I go on.  I don't care.  Not before that scene.  Eat a burrito. 
[03:13:30]  I do.  Eat a burrito.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Oh, that's classic.  Have you ever had a mishap?  Oh, yes.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Do you have a good mishap story?  Before I learned about Imodium, I had my mishaps.  Oh, God.  Imodium, huh?  That cleans you out.  Imodium cleans you out of prevention.  It sucks you up.  Yeah.  Oh, does it?  Yeah.  Make sure everything stays where it is.  So it stays put.  Right.  You got a good mishap story, though?  Something happened?  Oh, you guys do not want to hear about it. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah, we do.  We do.  Yeah.  No, then I won't get any votes on VoteBree.com.  No, believe me.  You'll get so many votes.  How about if our listeners promise to go to VoteBree.com after the mishap story?  They're already saying you are going to get so many votes.  Tell the story.  Please tell the story.  Yeah.  They love you, Bree.  You can't do anything.  They do love you.  I'll vote 10 times.  I'll vote twice.  They will, too.  It's horrible.  This will put you over the top, I guarantee, and you will call us and go, God damn it, 
[03:14:30]  you guys were right.  You know why?  Because you're a real person.  It's a real girl's story.  Put me over the top.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I'm easy.  All right.  Well, so now I just do the Imodium, and that works fine.  But before that, when I first got started in the industry, I said, well, what's the way  to prepare to do an anal scene?  And they say you have to do an enema, which is where you, you know, put the fluid up there  and then squared it back out. 
[03:15:00]  Well, so I used to do that, and one time, I guess it all didn't come out.  And, you know, while it's sitting up there in your anal cavity, and it's just kind of  mixing around with the other things that are in there.  So then, next thing you know, we're in the middle of the anal scene.  He's going at it, and brown water just starts squirting everywhere.  And it was just a huge puddle of brown water on the couch.  Oh, that's fantastic.  That's great.  Wait for Gene Wilder to come out on a little boat of chocolate. 
[03:15:30]  Wow.  Bobby D. and Brockton just writes, I'm just waiting to click.  He wanted to hear the story first, and now he's officially voting.  And now he's voting.  See?  He's just voting.  So what do you do when something like that happens?  You know, you clean up, and you finish the scene.  But was he cool about it, the guy?  You know, guys are so over it.  They don't care at all.  You know, they've seen it all.  It doesn't matter.  It depends.  Guy kept his rod.  It depends what you look like, Brie.  Someone like you, of course. 
[03:16:00]  Of course.  Do whatever you want.  You bring a four home, and she's doing that.  You're showing her the curve.  That's great.  All kinds of fucking water comes squirting.  Brown water.  Gotta love it.  Yeah.  Yeah, you wait for Daniel Day-Lewis to bring his deaf son over.  So who is the guy that you're having sex with in this scene?  Are you jealous, Jimmy?  Yes.  Oh, that's Tommy Gunn.  Of, uh...  Oh.  I mean, me and Tommy are practically dating.  We fucked so much on these movies.  Wow. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  So you guys are very comfortable together.  Yeah.  I hate him.  I mean, no, you know, I get on set, and I'm like, God, you again?  You know, like, people ask, who's my favorite person to work with?  I said, anyone knew, because it's like, I'm sick of seeing these guys all the time.  Well, you got Tommy Gunn.  Jimmy's got a nice little nickname.  Tell her your nickname, Jimmy.  Jimmy comes quick.  Jimmy Noodle.  So, um, you work with Nacho?  Or no? 
[03:17:00]  Nacho Vidal?  I don't know who that is.  Oh, okay.  He's like, they say he's, he used to date Belladonna.  A lot of people say he's like the best performer ever.  Like, he's one of those guys that could fuck anywhere.  Uh, like Rocco.  You ever hook up with Rocco?  Dude!  I don't think so, no.  Oh, you don't know Rocco?  I don't think so.  Are her votes going up?  I need to know.  People are just saying, I need to know.  People are saying they're voting like crazy.  Twisties only updates every hour.  So, it's not going to be able to...  I gotta, well, no, I am stupid. 
[03:17:30]  Uh, Twisties, what is that?  It's just an adult website.  No, I understand.  I understand.  It's more vanilla based.  It has, but it has really beautiful girls on it though.  Like, you know, all the, all the top girls are on there.  And, you know, they do really awesome photo shoots and solo sets.  And then they even do like the vanilla boy girl sets.  So.  I don't understand what Twisties mean.  Is that some kind of porn term or something?  No, it's just the name of the company.  Just Twisties.  Just Toronto War.  It's kind of a cool, memorable name.  Twisties. 
[03:18:00]  Twisties.  Oh, what is all that?  Well, I just...  A lot of nudity.  I just wanted to see who was in last place in this contest.  Oh.  Who is that?  It's Crystal Klein.  Well, don't give out her name.  Yeah, no.  Fuck her.  Shut up.  Danny, what's wrong with you?  What's wrong with you?  Boatbrie.com.  Boatbrie.com.  That's all you gotta do.  Her name stinks anyway.  That's not a sexy porn name.  Oh, I just want to...  Let's take a look.  Oh, fuck this chick.  Oh.  Yeah, she looks like a little Daryl Hannah and a little somebody else in there.  Yeah.  Playing close. 
[03:18:30]  Oh, God.  No, no, no.  Don't even pay attention to that.  Yeah, let's...  It's all about Brie Olsen.  Yes.  I'm Twittering Brie's feet.  Let's really put that on the one.  Are you?  Oh, goodness.  I gotta follow you on Twitter.  You should.  Why aren't you following little Jimmy Norton on Twitter?  Why aren't you following me on Twitter?  I didn't know you were.  Oh, shit.  You want to get some followers today?  Yes.  What's the name?  I guarantee you she's got more than...  Brie Olsen 9.  Brie Olsen 9?  Brie Olsen 9.  Who has Brie Olsen? 
[03:19:00]  Brie...  Who the fuck do we have to beat up for you?  Olsen is O-L-S-O-N.  Oh, I'm sorry.  And who has the Brie Olsen that won't give up their name?  I don't know.  Some girl named Brie Olsen?  Oh, fuck her.  Is she taking...  She's squatting.  She's taking cock?  She's squatting on the name.  Meanwhile, Brie's squatting on a giant cock.  Look at...  Look at that.  Wait, the first post is at Pat from Wunaki, and Brie writes, LOL, thank you.  What did Pat write?  Fucking Pat.  I don't know.  Pat's one of our guys, you know.  Oh, it is?  Yes.  And Pat just... 
[03:19:30]  What did Pat write?  He has a Twitter whore.  What did Pat write to Brie Olsen?  I need to know.  Pat's a Twitter whore.  Oh, here we go.  At Brie Olsen.  Can't wait to hear you on ONA.  I think I'll pass the time by going to VoteBrie.com and vote for you.  What a brown person.  Oh, you said shoot fucking brown water all over Pat's face.  Wow, I like that.  Is this the site?  On a brown water drinking contest.  You follow each other?  Do you actually answer your Twitters?  Yes. 
[03:20:00]  No, I do my own Twitters, yeah.  I mean, it's so convenient because I just do it right there on my iPhone and when I'm bored at the airport or whatever.  Yeah, see, that's what I do on the iPhone.  It's so easy.  Where's my BlackBerry people?  BlackBerry.  In the Stone Ages.  They're all dead.  You're a frozen time.  No, the BlackBerry is hanging in there.  Some of them are.  iPhone is where it's at.  Yeah, yeah.  All the apps and shit you can get.  Of course.  All the fun stuff.  Games you can do on the shitter.  Yeah.  It's fucking wonderful, man.  Just sit there for like hours until your legs are numb. 
[03:20:30]  Until it just crusts off.  You don't even have to wipe anymore.  Oh, fuck, Danny.  Danny downloaded that airline air traffic control game.  That game is great.  Isn't it?  It's a good thing as hell.  I landed 58 planes.  58 fucking planes.  That's insanity.  It's a great game.  I'm going to follow.  I got to find.  AdamandEve.com.  Go to user.  No more friends.  Still has a crush on Jim Norton. 
[03:21:00]  Wow.  Oh, my God.  I got asked.  Is it you have a sex scene on tape that is so brutal, her webmaster won't even upload it.  Oh, that.  Yes.  Fear of fear of obscenity prosecution.  Yeah.  What can you say about that?  She's afraid to be prosecuted for obscenity.  Yes.  Well, I wanted to shoot something very extreme and hardcore for my members on Brie Olson.com.  So I decided to do like a jail cell scene. 
[03:21:30]  And I hired a guy, Steven Sincroy.  He's a male talent.  Oh, yeah.  I thought he would, you know, be really good at being, you know, dominating and just totally beating the shit out of me.  So I got him in there and I said, just don't hold back.  I said, just tear me up in the scene.  Do whatever you want.  Throw me around.  Slap me around.  Hit me around.  Do whatever you like.  Holy shit.  And just fuck me anywhere.  Do anything.  He's like, okay.  I've thought women have said that to me. 
[03:22:00]  But it was leave me alone.  Yes.  It was really a hello.  I misread them.  Don't be Mr. ShamWow now.  Oh, yeah.  He's a real true one.  So he just, you know, sticking my head in the toilet, throwing me up against the walls.  I had rope burns for the next three days, which you can actually see on my blog on Brie Olson.com,  the rope marks around my neck and my wrists and everything.  But it was just really rough. 
[03:22:30]  It was so much that I was crying during the scene.  Not because I didn't like it, but it was just such strong, you know, you just can't hold back from feeling that way after so much physical punishment, I guess.  You know what's crazy about this scene that's never been seen?  Brie Olson just gave me permission to give out the secret link on my Twitter account, OP Radio.  So if you join OP Radio on Twitter, I will give out the secret link. 
[03:23:00]  You Twitter whore.  Well, you got to worry about that kind of stuff because they are fucking prosecuting people.  But why if...  Wait, Brie, so what's the problem with the clip for real?  Is it sex and violence put together?  What's the problem with the clip?  If you could, you know, prove that you gave permission for this scene and stuff.  Why would...  Wow, look at the marks.  There's the other one around my neck, too.  Ooh.  Right there.  Yeah. 
[03:23:30]  Oh, my God.  What the F?  Brie.  Jesus.  Dude, it was great at the time.  It didn't seem like it was that bad.  And what made the mark on your neck again?  Rope.  Rope.  All right.  I see where there might be a few problems.  I know.  Well, anyway, so I showed it to my webmaster, and he told me to bury it six feet under.  He said, don't ever let this get out.  I'm like, well, do you think we could edit it?  He's like, no.  There is nothing out of this we can use.  Are you afraid?  It's in my boat.  Well, I never put it up. 
[03:24:00]  I never put it up.  I was just, you know, a little video.  Are you going to put it up eventually?  No.  I'm just going to...  We can make some money off that.  Let's all talk.  All right.  Secret link, you know.  Wow.  It's something you watch, you know, at home, and, you know.  Right.  By the way, she follows Dane Cook on Twitter, but not little Jimmy Norton.  That's all right.  That could be a problem.  Well, we haven't seen each other.  I only follow three people on Twitter.  Ava Rose.  Ava Rose.  She's one of my good friends.  Okay.  She's in the industry.  And Fox Modeling and Dane Cook. 
[03:24:30]  Which is my agency.  And Dane Cook.  Oh.  What?  Dane Cook.  Really?  You like Dane Cook?  I love Dane Cook.  No, you want Dane Cook.  Do you know Dane at all?  I fucking wish.  All right.  Here's going to be a problem.  Wow.  Wow.  Now there is a problem.  Yeah.  Dane's a friend of mine.  Yeah.  Jimmy's very sad right now, Brie.  No, I'm not sad.  No, look at his face.  A little sad.  A little bit. 
[03:25:00]  Is there any way you can make Jimmy a little happy?  Dane's my friend.  Um, I could promise him blowjobs the rest of his life to introduce me to Dane?  Possibly.  No, that's what you call a catch-22.  Right now, Bob Kelly's racing to the station.  Yeah.  To give me the blowjobs.  Dude!  Yeah!  Wow.  You like the Dane, huh?  He's, you know, the only celebrity I'm following on Twitter.  That's the person I'm most...  God damn.  I don't like this. 
[03:25:30]  I don't like...  This is going to hurt.  This is going to make the long-term relationship very difficult.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just knowing.  Because now I can't trust her around Dane.  Because what if you guys are out on the town?  Jimmy ignores me anyway.  I mean, after Jimmy started ignoring my phone calls, I had to get a different crush on someone.  Oh, Jimmy.  It's not true, but Jimmy's a fickle guy.  What's wrong with you, Jimmy?  Jimmy is very busy, and I respect that.  I'm not a clingy person, and I respect the fact that he's very busy.  How many times did he call Jimmy, and he didn't call you back?  I called him just about a week ago. 
[03:26:00]  Never called me back.  I left him a sweet, sweet voicemail.  Oh, Jimmy.  A very sweet voicemail.  And I loved it, and I did text you back yesterday, but it was because...  Yes, only because of the show.  Oh.  Why?  Are you coming on the show?  That's it.  No, because there was a booking problem.  Yes, yes.  And that's the only reason.  No, it's not.  I was actually busy.  I'm preparing for something, and I've been working on the show.  I'm working on a set, and my epilogue of my book was due, so I've actually been doing  that for the last few days, because it was due today.  You're talking to the queen of excuses, that giving people excuses.  Oh, man.  She's not falling for any of your shit, Jimmy. 
[03:26:30]  All right.  How about this?  What's the problem, Jimmy?  No.  I love her.  There's no problem at all.  Yeah, I want to know.  She's pretty much perfect.  What's the problem?  There's no problem.  Well, the Dane thing puts a little kink in it, but I can live with that.  You didn't even know about that.  Nah, but I know it now.  I said it.  We can get past that.  Well, I had to move on.  I just have to comment on this.  What?  You don't like the muscle guy on Maury right now?  On Maury, there's this giant black guy that just came out.  He was walking.  They had to pixelate his underwear. 
[03:27:00]  He's wearing underwear.  His cock is so big that they had to pixelate it as he came out.  Jesus, what a friggin' beast.  Do you like muscle guys there, Brie?  No.  I do not like that.  That does not turn me on whatsoever.  There's a check for Jimmy.  That actually puts things a little bit back into perspective.  Dane's got such troubles right now anyway.  He doesn't need any new involvements, I'm telling you. 
[03:27:30]  And the fact that Dane is gay would stop it anyway.  Yeah, that's true.  He's not.  No, that's terrible.  No, but for this particular show, he is.  Yeah.  Because you like him.  So therefore, I will say what I need to.  Ruin that.  Just being honest.  A lot of people say, Brie, you can call them, and they're going to call you back.  Well, I appreciate that, guys.  Thank you.  I'm glad someone cares about me. 
[03:28:00]  You really want Jimmy to call you back.  I happen to, Brie and I text, we go through this period, we'll text a little bit, and then  we won't.  She's busy, I'm doing gigs, and then we text a little bit, and then we go.  And basically what happens is that I will be the last one to text in the conversation,  and I never hear anything back for about...  What scares you about Brie?  Nothing at all.  I like Brie very much.  She lives...  She really wants you.  Look at her.  Brie lives in Indiana.  I live here.  Brie has a very busy career.  She works.  She does films.  She said she would move to New York, Jimmy.  Yeah, but it's like right now she's in a part of her life where she's doing films and she's 
[03:28:30]  working.  So it's like I have to respect that, too.  Why couldn't I stay here for a little while?  Yeah.  I could come stay with you.  You could come stay with me for a little while.  That you could absolutely do.  I didn't know if you'd want to do that.  I would love to.  Okay.  I'd love to come hang out with you for like a week and show that at your place.  I would like that a lot.  Okay.  Consider it done.  Let's do it in August.  Consider it done.  And you know what would be really interesting?  Is it?  When you guys wonder where I am.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  We'll know when that week comes around. 
[03:29:00]  Believe me, nobody will be trying to get out of here fucking faster every morning than  I will.  Fucking by 6.30.  Like, are we done?  That's the week you're not here.  Yeah.  Stupid.  Yeah, I would take the week off.  Oh, hell yeah.  I think we'd have.  But I'm a boring guy.  You know, I like to just go out to eat.  I don't do much.  I mean, I sit around the house.  That's what I like, too.  I like to eat and fuck.  Those are my two pastimes.  Let's do it.  Fuck the eating.  That sounds like a fantastic week.  What about the shit?  The shit's up there, right? 
[03:29:30]  What?  Taking a good shit.  Oh.  Not in between the two activities.  I'm just saying it's got to be up there.  I don't know.  That's not something I think about.  Women don't get the pleasure out of it that we do.  Like, I like the shit.  Like, most guys do.  Like, I like one that kicks my legs out straight.  You ever shit and your legs kick out straight?  You're mesmerized by that guy's cock.  It's the, no, it's the pixelating.  I know what you're getting at.  It's amazing that they had to pixelate his giant schlong through his underwear.  Brie, he's got a big mushroom. 
[03:30:00]  He's wearing fucking, like, boxer briefs, and they had to pixelate the whole fucking front  of it out.  Yeah.  Maybe he made cumzies.  Ew.  That only happens.  I know.  A little pre-cum.  What are you saying to a guy that has the cumzies?  A little early cumzies.  Aw.  How do you make him feel good?  Um.  Laugh at him?  You just chuckle and go, is that it?  You know, I don't know.  Sometimes I get really pissed off because it's like, if it's really way, way too fast, 
[03:30:30]  then I get mad because I didn't get my enjoyment out of it.  No shit.  That's got to be frustrating.  It's just sad.  Yes, it makes me very sad inside.  This is a sensitive subject.  You get mad?  What do you do?  Just kind of roll over and go like, ah.  Um, well, usually it's someone that I have in my hotel room, and I usually kick him out  at that point.  Oh, man.  Imagine how fucking degraded you would be.  I shot my fucking load in two seconds, and she kicked me out. 
[03:31:00]  Get out.  Yeah, get out.  Get out.  Get out.  Get out.  Wow.  Well, I always have my vibrator with me, so if worse comes to worse, then I just have  them fuck me with the vibrator.  That'd be great, though.  You'd kick him out, the door shuts, and he just hears, brrrr, coming from inside.  It's like, fuck, just kill yourself.  We got Ray in South Dakota, big Brie Olsen fan.  Oh, you can call.  Right.  Love your work.  I don't know if it's worth going to the phone for that. 
[03:31:30]  Aw.  So we got adamandeve.com.  What else?  Because we're going to take a break here.  Vote Brie.  If you want to hang, you're more than welcome.  Yeah, you got votebrie.com, brieolsen.com, Brie's Big Camp Out, and Miami.  We've got listeners in Miami.  You're doing the Exotica show.  We've been doing an Exotica show.  All the porn stars are going to be there.  It's going to be so huge down in Florida.  I always get Florida fever, so you never know what I'm going to do.  Yeah.  It's a good time.  When is that? 
[03:32:00]  May...  May through the 10th.  May through the 10th.  Yeah.  So well.  You look very sexy.  Oh, my goodness.  Look at that.  It's cute.  It's like Homer Simpson's trying to talk between her legs.  Can I see that photo?  Jesus.  That's great.  Wow.  What?  Hey.  Your votes are way up on votebrie.com.  Those are beautiful.  The shit story puts you over the top.  Oh, yeah.  It puts you right over.  Yeah, the brown water.  People love it.  Yeah.  Love the brown water.  Oh, goodness. 
[03:32:30]  Votebrie.com.  Votebrie.com.  Yeah, I Twittered that, too.  There.  Look at that.  What?  That is the best thing ever.  My toy.  My cyber ass.  Whoa.  It is so cool.  It's life-size.  It's the size of my ass.  It's the size of your ass.  It's just an ass.  It feels so real.  Well, it has the asshole.  It has the pussy in it.  It is the best thing ever.  I had to go out and get one right away, but my friends, they love it.  They're playing with it and slapping it, and it feels so real.  What about fucking it?  It's so realistic.  Well, you could.  Can you mail us one so we can play around with it a little bit? 
[03:33:00]  We'll play basketball.  I can have Adam and Eve.  That's pretty cool.  I could probably have Adam and Eve send you guys.  It is so awesome.  How do you clean it?  Like, you know, you come in there.  You got to get that out.  Yeah.  Well, it has, like, little openings on the other end, too.  Oh, it does.  Yeah.  So you could get a faucet in there or something.  Yeah.  Something.  Something.  Little cleaning utensils.  How do they make the fake ass?  You have to sit and shit?  Yeah, I had to get molded, and they show pictures on the side of the box.  But do they have to get some of the stuff inside, or they don't need to be that accurate? 
[03:33:30]  No.  Just the outside.  They don't need to be all that.  Don't be accurate.  But it's like your authentic lips and everything?  Yeah.  And your maze, like, that looks exactly like my...  Yes.  I was like, this is so cool.  I love it.  I love it, love it, love it.  There's a better one.  Oh, better picture of it right there.  Let's get a good picture, Danny.  What's the matter with you?  Come on, Danny.  What are you doing with you?  The pictures still don't do it justice, though.  It's just so...  We have to have intern David.  ...working amazing.  No, that doesn't...  Bring this home and, you know, go to town on it. 
[03:34:00]  What do you think, Ant?  Intern David brings it home?  Yes.  That's a little bit better.  Yeah.  All right.  Now we learned about the ass you could buy.  That one works?  No.  Oh, yeah.  There.  Make it bigger.  That looks good.  Wow.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Thank you, Brie.  Thank you.  I think we did.  Yes.  We did good.  Yeah.  I think so.  There you go.  They're saying you're way ahead of voting.  Yeah.  But that doesn't mean you should stop voting.  We want to make this look ridiculous.  Wow, that's a tight rubber asshole. 
[03:34:30]  Sure is.  But, oh, something that I forgot to tell you guys about VoteBrie.com is that you guys can  vote every day.  They're not listening.  They're talking about dolphins.  Oh, no.  You're listening.  No, that was the best compliment I could give you.  If you look up a dolphin's ear and go side by side with the...  Oh, thank you.  Yes.  Is that a dolphin's...  No, that's not a dolphin's ear.  That's his eye.  No, that's not.  Dolphin's ear is even smaller than that.  I can't believe you guys. 
[03:35:00]  You're way too fast.  Oh, there it is.  It's kind of creepy.  That tiny little dot is an actual dolphin's ear.  I gave you the best compliment.  And that is how tight your rubber ass is.  That asshole really is very snug.  That's a snug hiney on the doll.  I'm the best at dolphin humor ever.  Ever.  We should go.  Well, yeah, I do have to get going, but I just want to tell everyone.  I'm going to Indiana.  I'm going home.  I'm going on a flight right now. 
[03:35:30]  Jimmy.  Free us to fly.  Jimmy.  We're ordering something once you can come back.  She wouldn't have to get that flight in a second.  He knows how long I've been in town for.  I've been here for like four days.  Oh, damn.  Exactly.  Anyways.  Oh, fucking A.  Four days, Jimmy, and you give her one text?  Look at that taint.  Rubber taint.  I'm confused.  That was about the show, too.  I know, right?  Yeah, about the show.  Four days in town.  Yeah.  Ridiculous.  One text to ask her if she's coming on the show.  I never said. 
[03:36:00]  Brittany and I keep in touch in a very weird way.  I'm not at all good at keeping in touch.  It's not that I don't want to, because I really like Brie a lot.  I'm a very bad keeper in touch.  She's shaking her head.  She knows that, though.  I'm a very bad keeper in touch.  But she's somebody that I'll know for a long time, and we'll wind up spending a lot of time  together and seeing each other.  Brie, I'll probably know for many, many years.  Brie, it's safe to say that he's the problem.  It just needs to be said.  But she's also busy, too.  Don't let him try to put some of the blame over on me.  I'm not allowing it.  But anyways, last thing I wanted to say before I go, votebrie.com. 
[03:36:30]  You can vote every day, once a day.  So I just wanted to let everyone know.  Vote for Brie.  She's the coolest girl we have come in here.  You're going to call us out of nowhere and go, I can't believe the power of your audience.  It's ridiculous.  They're not going to stop voting.  Aw.  That's awesome.  What do you win?  I win cash, and I win a Rolex.  Oh, a Roley, yo.  And what do you do for our fans that put you over the top?  Free blowjobs for all.  All righty.  Do you know what the fans want, though?  You have sex with one of the hosts of the radio show. 
[03:37:00]  That's what they want.  Oh, that's what the fans want.  Isn't it?  In his plush Long Island home?  No.  Oh.  Not that one.  I thought when you said one of the hosts.  No, no, not the HIV positive host.  When the hell did this happen?  I'm clean as a whistle, my friend.  It's true.  It's a whistle to the Robert Reed's asshole. 
[03:37:30]  It's not going to get better than that.  Let's thank Brie Olsen for coming by.  Thank you so much.  Good friend of the show.  And we'll see you soon, all right?  Thank you.  I love you guys.  I've got to tell you guys how lucky you are.  We were going to just go home.  But we're back.  So enjoy another few minutes of the Opie and Anthony show.  And we're better than ever.  We're back. 
[03:38:00]  Brie Olsen was amazing, huh?  But she's a good one.  She's one of the good ones.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Jeremy in Cleveland.  What do you got, Jeremy?  Good evening.  Hey, Jeremy.  How are you?  I got a sucks to be you or a lucky lottery story that I heard this morning on the news.  God damn it.  Tyra's looking more and more like a tranny every day.  And I know we've said that for a few years now.  But she is looking more and more manly.  Yeah.  She looks like separated at birth with RuPaul at this point. 
[03:38:30]  Yeah, she is looking very RuPaul-ish age.  Dude, she was put up a young.  I know it's not into the black girls.  But put a young picture of Tyra up on the screen for us.  Jeremy, what do you got?  Yeah, I got a lucky, a sucks to be you story or a lucky lottery.  I want you to decide.  Okay.  I heard it on news this morning.  A guy in a wheelchair got ran over and killed by a bus.  A year to the date, he was ran over by a bus and lost his legs. 
[03:39:00]  Wow, that is an unlucky lottery, dude.  Why?  Why would you want your legs if you're in a wheelchair?  To be reminded that you got something that should be getting you around.  But he got hit by a bus twice?  Yes.  A year to the date.  A year to the day.  Well, that's obvious that the guys waited and decided, all right, the year to the day were my...  Oh, you think it's intentional?  Yeah.  He threw himself under the bus? 
[03:39:30]  Yeah, I think so.  Quite literally.  Okay, that's an old picture of Tyra.  She got some tranny...  All right, man.  Take it easy.  Her tits are nice, though, man.  Those are some tranny features to her, though.  Those are some big, fucking heavy, fucking...  She had the heavy ones.  Big milk tits.  She don't really have hips for a black girl, though.  Like, not very hippish girl.  Yeah, good point.  It should be said, Fast Freddy writes,  We're not that stupid, Opie.  We had odds at 117 to 1.  You'd return. 
[03:40:00]  Freddy's too fresh.  And then someone's like,  You guys just haven't figured out how to sneak out of the new building yet.  That's true.  That's true, too.  No, we got to go home, man.  I think we did as much as we can today.  I think we did.  We did good.  Except check the stocks.  Let's see.  How are we doing, Ant?  I want to see how that's doing.  Oh, my God.  Oh, it's down even further.  I can't call him.  Wow.  Jimmy, who's calling you?  I'm getting hammered on Bank of America. 
[03:40:30]  Oh, this must be an important call.  Hammered.  Jim's leaving the studio and not playing the bit.  He's not doing the bit today.  Do the bit!  Do the bit!  Do the bit!  Do the bit!  Oh, my God.  Why didn't I punch out at 11?  Why?  What is it down to?  766.  That's a share.  Just a little...  It was at 11 or so,  and I stuck it out thinking,  yeah, I'll sell at 15 or something.  You'll be fine.  I knew I'll regret it.  I knew I would go.  New Real Rock TV video going up around... 
[03:41:00]  Let's make it...  I got to do a little nappy.  Mm-hmm.  After my nappy.  3 o'clock.  3 o'clock.  We're going turkey bowling, baby.  Turkey bowling will be on my OP Radio YouTube account.  Nice.  Yes.  One a day, people.  One a day.  And I'll plug mine.  I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll plug mine.  Mogulis.  Mogulis, right.  I'm on mogulis.com slash anthony radio. 
[03:41:30]  Are you doing any shit today?  I don't know.  I might.  I'll take a nap, too,  and then I might wake up and feel so inclined to hit the studio and do a live show.  But if you go there, go to the On Demand button.  Click the On Demand button in the viewer and go that way.  It's easier, and you'll get a picture.  For some reason, I'm not getting a goddamn picture.  You just hear the sound.  You're like a jam.  You're like the jam on station that Sirius has.  Is that it?  It's long form.  It's just kind of, man.  It's just a long, I just, you know. 
[03:42:00]  Let her rip.  One long fish song.  Yeah.  One long string cheese incident song.  Anybody else with a jam band?  The string cheese incident.  Who had a bunch of their, I was at someone's house.  I don't know.  They had the worst cat ever.  Their cat was fucking, yeah, I hated this.  I very rarely want to fucking hit a cat with a golf club.  But this thing was just fucking, this cat was barking at me.  Look at Steve.  Golf club.  Yes.  This is violence.  Wounded, innocent thing. 
[03:42:30]  Steve's happy.  Yeah.  See, again, it's just a black screen.  I don't understand why my frigging reruns won't run and rerun.  I have to go to On Demand.  It's probably Bandwidth or something.  Go to On Demand.  It's a Bandwidth thing.  But I go to other people's stuff that have a lot of people on, and their fucking stuff shows up.  I don't know.  I'm going to have to talk to the Mogulists people.  The mighty Mogulists.  Sounds like a bunch of malarkey as far as I'm concerned.  Oh, it's Mogulists.  I'm Mogulists. 
[03:43:00]  There's Moogus.  If you go to English language, yeah, go to up top English, I'm very high up in the rating.  That's good.  There.  Yeah.  All right.  Because it's so entertaining.  We got all the plugs out.  Jim, you got a plug?  Just down in the audio.  Jim Norton is now in stores.  That's all.  Yeah, I think I'm looking around.  We really don't have anything else for you today.  No, no, no.  We can play the welcome to Sirius thing Derek and Steve put together. 
[03:43:30]  One more time, in case you missed it earlier.  Yeah, that was good.  And then we'll see you guys tomorrow.  Hasta mañana.  We appreciate it.  We're having fun here.  It's obvious to everybody.  So that will continue until the bosses ruin that.  The thing is to keep listening to find out how they ruined the fun we're having over here.  That's true.  It always starts off with fun.  They'll wreck it.  Somehow, someway.  They sure will.  Some dumb thing will come up.  All right, guys.  Thanks. </pre>
