<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a nonsensical bit about a virus, before pivoting to a discussion of current events: water on Mars, a space shuttle launch, the Iraq War, and celebrity breakups (Britney Spears and Jennifer Aniston/Vince Vaughn).  The hosts speculated about Aniston's breakup, focusing on their perception of her personality and comparing her unfavorably to Scarlett Johansson.  This transitioned into a heated and profane critique of a company-issued pamphlet, "Words, Hurt, and Harm," designed to prevent the use of racial and ethnic slurs and stereotypes.  Opie recounted a previous reprimand for his honest commentary on radio, further fueling their frustration.

The hosts dissected the pamphlet’s contents, reading excerpts sarcastically and engaging in a fill-in-the-blank game with listeners, generating numerous offensive jokes based on ethnic and racial stereotypes targeting Italians, Asians, African Americans, and Jewish people. They debated the offensiveness of slurs like "Chinaman," "gook," and "slant-eyed,"  and discussed the use of accents in comedy and the potential for unintentional harm.  Big A, a regular contributor, nearly choked during a "chubby bunny" challenge.  The hosts promoted upcoming appearances on *The Tonight Show* and a future "homeless shopping spree" segment.

The show then moved to a discussion about a 12-year-old arrested for opening Christmas presents early, followed by stories about the hosts' own childhood Christmas misadventures, including gift-swapping and blackmail. Club Soda Kenny, a recurring guest, provided his darkly comedic news segment, covering an E. coli outbreak linked to Taco Bell, space shuttle delays, and the cost of "The Twelve Days of Christmas" gifts. A listener complained about a Chicago radio show, prompting a promise of further discussion.  A humorous anecdote about Kenny unexpectedly joining Jimmy on a date followed.

Announcements were made for a MacBook karaoke contest and a listener-submitted animation based on Jimmy's "Uncle Paul" character.  Jimmy discussed a skin tag removal appointment, leading to further off-color jokes and talk of his dating life, followed by an announcement of a live Paltalk appearance where listeners were encouraged to wear ridiculous clothing.  The "Homeless Shopping Spree" segment was promoted, which involved offensive comments and interactions with various people on the street, including a prolonged exchange with a homeless man named Andrew, along with a push-up contest with a soldier. The broadcast ended with a heavily mic'd-up recording of Jimmy's bowel movements in the bathroom, followed by further vulgar banter.

The next segment opened with a game guessing the number of wipes Jimmy used (eight). A caller, Jeff, offered to help with online fundraising for the "Homeless Shopping Spree," and Opie offered Islanders hockey tickets to nearby listeners. The hosts discussed a comedian, Jamie, fined and banned from the Laugh Factory for using a racial slur during a black comedy night, debating the club owner’s actions.  A countdown of TV Land's top ten greatest TV quotes ensued, with Big A attempting impressions.  The discussion included listener calls requesting specific quotes or the Islanders tickets (requiring the code word "cock smuggler"). The show continued with banter about the quote list, radio ratings, and potential company mergers; Eric Logan was present in studio.

The final segment began with the surprise revelation that Don Wicklin, an employee, recently married in Las Vegas, contradicting widespread speculation among XM employees that he was gay.  Elo, visibly intoxicated, and the hosts reacted with shock, and Wicklin's upset reaction was described. The conversation shifted to Elo's drunken exploits, including an expensive dinner after a David Letterman appearance, and anecdotes about their frugal super agent, Bob Eatman. Ben from Paltalk, a recipient of Islanders tickets, announced he was a "size queen."  The "Line of the Day" contest was announced, and the show concluded with further vulgar discussion about potential company mergers and speculation. Don Wicklin left the show visibly upset.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  Nothing else has the power to bring a nation to its knees like the consequences of a killer epidemic.  One goes in, millions come out. Every cell is dead.  Don't mess with this stuff.  Okay, sirs, here we go.  Virus.  What is the virus?  In the space of an hour, a single virus has invaded, multiplied, and killed the cell.  Continually multiplying.  Searching for the next victim until there's nothing left to kill. 
[00:00:30]  The answer to infection.  There is no answer to infection. It's already done pretty much all the damage it can.  Fills their veins and blood with their pure rage.  And then eventually, everything just stops.  The virus is spreading.  If this doesn't make you want to throw out a failure.  The most annoying thing on two legs.  What a bore fest.  Who cares about the funny?  Just bring me the porn.  Aren't we dumb?  Tee hee.  O.P. 
[00:01:00]  O.P.  Do you want to play?  Anthony.  I will beat children about the head.  Jim Norton.  I'm dancing.  I'm dancing.  I'm just, I'm a naked whore.  It's indescribable.  I'm trying.  It's like a rape that's covered by insurance.  Oh!  Some of the comments they make are uncalled for.  Ha!  Ha!  Why are you crying?  The virus finally hit him.  Well, with Jimmy, you never know.  It could be AIDS.  No.  Yes.  Yes.  It's the O.P.  and Anthony show.  The virus that spreads from town to town across the U.S.  and the Hague. 
[00:01:30]  And...  I hate you.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  There you go. 
[00:02:00]  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  I might need this.  Thank you.  For some reason, the studio wasn't set up today.  The mic was swung over to the other side of the room.  The program buttons weren't down, so you couldn't hear us.  I started the show, and I'm talking to myself.  Frog.  And then Anthony doesn't have a microphone in front of him.  All right.  Good morning.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony show.  Hi, everybody.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  We have lots to do today.  There's water on Mars. 
[00:02:30]  Is there, though?  There's a space shuttle going up in the sky.  Tonight.  Iraq is still a mess.  A little report came out on that.  People love Britney Spears and her panties.  Lack thereof.  And also her panties when she does decide to wear them.  And Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn are done as a couple. 
[00:03:00]  Who do you think's the problem there?  I think it's Aniston.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's definitely got some kind of issues.  Jennifer Aniston refuses to be a hooah in the bedroom.  Maybe she's a C.  She's not a dirty girl.  You've got to get messy sometimes.  You've got to mess it up.  She is Greek.  A couple extra points there.  She's been told her whole life how beautiful she is and blah, blah, blah. 
[00:03:30]  So she doesn't get down and dirty in the bedroom.  And that's why these guys are going, you know what?  There's a girl just as hot as you, but she gets a little crazy in the bedroom.  Scarlett Johansson apparently reports are that she's quite the whore.  Yeah.  But she's very attractive.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  She's probably been told her whole life that she's attractive, though.  Look, we talk about this all the time.  You want a lady, but you also want your lady to be, you know, open to some things from time to time.  Have a little skank in her?  Yeah, just a little.  Just a little.  Just a drop or two of skank. 
[00:04:00]  A little skank.  Just a little.  And I think Jennifer Aniston, she's had that privilege.  Skankless?  Yeah, she's had the privileged life, and she has to make sure her stupid haircut is perfect every time.  And she wears the Rachel, I believe that was called.  The Rachel.  Whatever.  When you have a hairstyle named after you.  Right.  Yeah, maybe you get a little full of yourself.  You never see a picture of her just a little messy.  Just a little.  Mm-hmm.  All our other starlets that we know and love.  You see them from time to time with a little mess. 
[00:04:30]  Never taking the trash out.  Paparazzi catches her, you know, lifting the lid of her garbage can.  Yeah.  Looking all, like, morning face and everything.  Oh, yeah.  Never see that.  No.  Wow.  We don't need to talk about Jennifer Aniston.  I don't know.  That's just where we begin.  Good point.  What we need to talk about right off the bat.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Hi, buddy.  I want everybody to have their copies in hand.  I'm actually, I'm grinding my teeth.  This is infuriating.  It's infuriating.  It's everything that is wrong with radio and with the political correctness and the way corporations think. 
[00:05:00]  Now, we've talked about radio in the past and gotten, Opie had a little chat in the corner because we got a little honest with radio.  Yeah, they don't like when you're honest.  Opie got a little talking to.  Yeah.  By Tom.  Yeah.  Or G.  Why me?  I don't know because Ant was doing the talking as well and Jimmy was as well.  But for some reason.  I ran to the bathroom and Jimmy shoved his face into a cereal bowl. 
[00:05:30]  No.  No.  You're trying to make it sound cool.  You guys are sitting right here and he pointed at me like I'm the troublemaker and dragged me into the corner.  And I'm like, but what about Ant?  He was right there in the conversation.  He probably talked more about the subject than I did.  But I hit the bell.  You know, and I was just teaching, you know, the company, you know, some lessons.  Yeah, a couple of things.  A couple of things.  Because I see what's going to happen with this whole thing eventually. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  If they don't wake up and stop lawyering, excuse me.  Lawyers.  Lawyering the hell out of radio, especially talk radio.  So you've got to understand the lawyers are what is screwing up radio.  It's not like management at the radio stations get upset when you talk ill of radio itself because they say, look, we're trying to run a business here.  So if you bad mouth it, it's harder for us to run business.  All right. 
[00:06:30]  I can be the corporate guy.  I can even understand that coming from the corporate level.  I can understand that.  What I don't understand is the involvement of lawyers in radio to the point where they should be involved when a station wants to buy a station, another station.  They should be involved in that deal.  They should be involved in litigation for the FCC, things like that.  But when their opinions and what they feel are the legal little wranglings filter down to what we do, which is the entertainment portion, the product that is pumped out of these stations, there is a huge, huge problem. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  And the lawyers' word, they come up with these suggestions, okay?  And no one pushes back.  That's what amazes me.  No one else in corporate goes, well, that's all well and good that you've come out with this pamphlet, words hurt and harm, but you're handcuffing my personalities here. 
[00:07:30]  We need a middle ground.  Does anyone talk to these people?  But there's no middle ground anymore.  It's the lawyers run radio.  I was telling Anthony in the office just before the show, you know, when FM radio came about, and Ann knows this and Jimmy knows this, it was a lot different.  FM radio came about in, like, the late 60s, mid to late 60s, let's say, when it really started getting some attention.  Came into its own, yeah. 
[00:08:00]  And you know what it was?  FM radio, it was a bunch of guys that got together and they smoked a lot of pot and did other drugs and they went on the air and played what they liked.  There were no playlists, there were no lawyers, there were no sales guys.  That was all for AM radio.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, that's why FM became so popular.  Yeah, people got so sick of dealing with AM radio because it became, like, this corporate entity and it had a lot of rules.  It was a very suit and tie.  Yeah. 
[00:08:30]  And boring.  It became boring.  Right.  Yeah, so FM, you know, rose to the top because, wow, this is so much, this is different.  These guys are playing whatever the hell they want and they sound effed up, man.  Yeah.  And I was telling Anne a quick story.  When I first started radio and when I was at WCMF as a nobody, one of my jobs, they were celebrating their 20th year as a radio station.  And it was my job to kind of call up all these old jocks around America and get old air checks.  And then they would have, like, it was called the WCMF moment, 20 years of radio, whatever. 
[00:09:00]  OK, and then you would play a piece of an air check from back in the day.  And I would go through these air checks and these guys would just be in the studio one after another, just like, oh, wow, it's snowing outside.  Wow.  That was a break.  Yeah.  And they would just, there would be dead air and stuff because the guy's just staring out the window and looking at the snow because, you know, he had too much tree before he started his show.  Yeah.  But it made for some amazing radio. 
[00:09:30]  So it went from that, I know that's only one example, to now, 25, 30 years later, we get a pamphlet called Words, Hurt, and Harm.  Yeah, this is called Words, Hurt, and Harm.  Now, the lawyers used to also put out a lot of things that had FCC rules in it.  That's what we used to get because you had to adhere to those.  And those wound up getting a little much, too.  But they'd have examples in there.  And these were rules that the government had put in place that we had to adhere to that the lawyers then told us what we had to do. 
[00:10:00]  And as frustrating as that was, we had no choice, as you said, because the government came up with these rules.  These, which we hold in our hands right now, have nothing to do with the FCC, with the government regulations, or anything.  This is against the First Amendment.  What I hold in my hand right here is communism.  You didn't read the rest of the title, Ant. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, I know, I know.  Yeah, Words, Hurt, and Harm, a primer for on-air talent and programming personnel.  How to develop greater awareness of and learn to avoid the use of racial and ethnic stereotypes and slurs.  And this from September of 2006, so it's very recent for lawyers, you know.  Well, you know.  We just get this in our hands.  I'm sure it had to be revised 8,000 times.  They had a bill, you know, CBS, millions of dollars for every little word that they changed.  I guess they were bored down there in Washington and was like, oh, my God, we better make ourselves look useful here. 
[00:11:00]  Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff.  What do you got over there?  Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff.  And then at the very first page, right at the top, the same title in red type, just in case you missed it, Words, Hurt, and Harm.  Yeah, yeah.  A primer for on-air talent, blah, blah, blah, racial and ethnic stereotypes and slurs.  Right.  Why should you be aware of racial and ethnic stereotypes?  That's the first headline right here.  What radio personalities say on the air significantly impacts the way their listeners perceive people who live in their communities. 
[00:11:30]  Given your important roles in the mass media as on-air talent and the programming personnel who support them,  you have the unique ability to perpetuate and reinforce racial and ethnic stereotypes and slurs or to ameliorate the harm they cause by challenging your listeners' perceptions.  So we can do both. 
[00:12:00]  We have the power.  We are God.  And become more aware of racial and ethnic stereotypes becoming.  We'll help you to properly use the special power, the special power you possess to influence the thinking of your listeners.  We have like Jedi mind tricks.  We can influence them.  Where's my beep?  Well, I didn't realize that we had such power, though.  Yeah, well, sure.  Wait till you get to the, uh, fill in the blank part of this. 
[00:12:30]  We have the power.  That **** didn't steal your car.  These are not the **** you're looking for.  Hey, keep it fair.  Keep it fair.  Keep it fair.  Keep it fair.  Let's spread it out a little bit today.  How are racial and ethnic stereotypes created?  Oh, wait.  There's something fun here I missed.  Imagine that you're, uh, walking down a dark street alone. 
[00:13:00]  In one scenario, a little old lady shuffles along, comes toward you.  Would you cross the street?  Would you hold your bag a little closer to your body?  In another scenario, a young man struts down the street, struts, ding, ding, keyword, uh, down the street towards you.  What does the young man look like?  What would your reaction, uh, would your reaction be different?  If so, why?  See, they're questioning us.  Oh, my God.  This has nothing to do with what's being broadcast.  This is like, this is like a sensitivity thing. 
[00:13:30]  Like a, um, a real liberal kind of, you're getting your brains bashed in kind of.  This gives a bad name to even liberals.  This is, this is beyond liberal.  Look, look, hey, look, lawyers.  Here's the real deal.  You're in Washington in an office building.  You'll probably get picked up in a car service or whatever it is when you leave your nice building and go to your nice house that is built on the dollars that you make writing this drivel.  It is garbage. 
[00:14:00]  We are out on the street in the mornings.  And believe me, if I see a young black man walking toward the street, uh, down the street toward me, and worse yet, if I see a few of them,  I am automatically putting myself in defensive mode and taking appropriate action to make myself as safe as possible, regardless, they could be a church group.  I don't want to find that out.  And, and, and, and yeah, and that will not change in our lifetime and, and, and how it pertains to our radio show. 
[00:14:30]  We have to discuss what's going on out there in the real world.  That's what's happening.  If a little old lady is walking down the street, I'm not going to care because 50 little old ladies weren't in Union Square last night stabbing each other.  It was gang violence.  And if you read off the names in the paper in today's, uh, daily news of the post, it's not one Mildred among them.  I didn't see one Millie.  I didn't see a Gertrude.  Right.  They weren't stabbing each other.  Right.  I would love to know how many of these vomit bag lawyers who work in D.C. actually walk out of their office and take a stroll down some of the lovely D.C. streets. 
[00:15:00]  Take a stroll down D.C.  And I'm not talking about around the monuments and the nice offices.  Not, not a strut among them.  No strutting.  When they're walking to their, uh, their lunches.  And to answer the question, imagine you're walking down the street alone.  In one scenario, a little old lady shuffles and comes towards you.  Would you cross the street?  No.  I'd rape her.  Oh, Jesus.  Right out my nose. 
[00:15:30]  And she could stereotype me.  Yeah, you would stereotype me.  Men with breathe right strips.  All right.  Where are we?  Uh, how are racial and ethnic stereotypes created?  Oh, I love this one.  Stereotypes are created by historical and societal processes.  They develop when people are unable or unwilling to obtain all of the information needed to make fair and informed judgments about others.  So you're just ignorant people. 
[00:16:00]  Stereotypes also evolve out of fear of persons from minority groups who may look or act differently than the majority.  No, that's not true.  It is absolutely not true.  No one is afraid of generous Jewish people.  Right.  Or of Asians who are great drivers or blacks in college.  Shall we keep going?  No one's afraid of the exceptions to the rule, you idiots.  And Asians excel in math.  Yes, they do.  They do.  They make great students.  They have a great work ethic, the Asian people.  But that we'll get to later where it says, even good stereotypes. 
[00:16:30]  Why should you avoid good stereotypes?  That's in here.  A big headline.  Why should you avoid good stereotypes?  Yeah.  Wow.  That's a little later in the program.  Children begin to acquire prejudices.  I want to be one of the colors on the front here.  This is wrong what they said.  How they develop when people are unwilling or unable to obtain all the information needed to make fair and informed judgments.  Now, stereotypes are obtained when people are just not deluding themselves and they're just stating what they have observed. 
[00:17:00]  That's how you pick up a stereotype when you've watched enough people of the same group who don't know each other behave exactly the same way in different circumstances than a stereotype is born.  It's not everyone in a group.  Right.  We're not stupid here.  It's not everybody in a certain racial group or whatever group you want to put them in.  Sexual orientation.  We're not talking about every person here.  But a stereotype can only be made and perpetuated if it's based in some fact. 
[00:17:30]  For the love of God, they don't pop out of nowhere.  Well, according to the pamphlet, children begin to acquire prejudices and stereotypes because they are taught directly and indirectly from the time they are toddlers.  Taught?  Or do they learn it by watching certain actions?  Of course you're taught certain things by your parents.  And you do see some of their stereotypes and prejudice.  But when you go out into the real world and become an adult, you're able to decide for yourself. 
[00:18:00]  You really are.  If you have half of mine, and again, I don't mean everybody.  Some people, you know, they get it in their head and that's all they know.  But a fairly educated person, a fairly intelligent person can make their own decisions based on life experiences and knowledge, not on what someone told them when they were a toddler.  Children may form attachments to their own groups and develop negative attitudes to other racial and ethnic groups. 
[00:18:30]  That has been going on since the beginning of time.  And by the way, do you notice here they say stereotypes evolve out of fear of persons from minority groups who may look or act differently than the majority, implying that only whites can stereotype.  That the majority, which would be, you know, regular, your regular white people, yeah, cannot be stereotyped or shouldn't be or can't be a danger or, yeah, you're absolutely right.  Like, blacks have no ability. 
[00:19:00]  And again, that is a fair thing.  A lot of it does evolve out of a fear of people.  But that's like saying that blacks or any other group can't have an irrational fear of a white cop.  Like, white cops don't ever get a bad rap in the media or by groups.  And you ask any white cop that works in a certain area and they're going to tell you, of course there's a bias against them.  Of course there's a dislike against them.  Maybe it's because of the actions of other cops.  Why should they suffer for the actions of other cops?  We've heard it on this show when we have guests, black guys come in here and talk about how white cops, just they've always been treated bad by them. 
[00:19:30]  So they assume every cop is bad to black people.  That's stereotyping.  There you go.  Where are we in this pamphlet?  Oh, my goodness.  Why are racial and ethnic stereotypes harmful?  Oh, but I'd like to cover it.  Why are they harmful?  Get to the bottom of this.  All right.  We covered the other one pretty good, I guess.  Yeah.  All right.  Why are racial and ethnic stereotypes harmful?  Members of the communities in which you live and work can be injured by racial and ethnic stereotypes. 
[00:20:00]  Some convenient categories of classifications for people have turned into harmful stereotypes.  This reduces the quality of life not only for the people who are targeted, but for the entire community.  Because it sows the seeds of conflict and keeps community members from getting to know each other.  Getting to know you, getting to know all about you.  Once a stereotype exists in your mind, it will affect your thinking as all members of that group. 
[00:20:30]  As to all members of that group.  It'll affect your thinking.  No, it won't.  Of course it won't.  People, even if you stereotype, you make decisions based on individuals.  It's just that that's what I do.  A lot of people goof around and make jokes about my mindset, my certain mindset.  But I absolutely judge people on an individual basis.  And that's when you get to know them.  But when you're walking around the streets in New York.  Right.  I don't know people from a hole in the wall.  When am I going to shake hands with everybody and what's your name and invite them over the house? 
[00:21:00]  Right.  I have to make a judgment somehow so it's on past performance.  When I go to the racetrack and place a bet on a horse, I'm going to place my bet on past performance of that horse.  Right.  If it's a winner, I'm going to bet him.  If he's a loser, he's lost every goddamn race, I'm not betting on him.  See, in your everyday life, you meet people of all different ethnicities.  And you make your own decisions.  But on the streets of New York, it's an effing jungle out there.  And the last thing you want to do is assume that everyone is not going to harm you. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  You're not going to make it too long.  You're not going to be.  In a major city that way.  No.  Oh, my God.  You're either going to get taken somehow, ripped off.  You'd be the injured gazelle.  Remember that girl who called up who had been raped by five black guys?  And she said that she got that awful feeling when she was getting a call.  She knew something wasn't right.  She knew something was wrong when she was walking with a couple of the guys.  But she didn't want to come off as racist.  Right.  And it's like we have that intuition at times with people.  And it's because of crap like this, which says that if you have that fear, that uncomfortability, you're stereotyping or you're a racist and you don't listen to your instincts. 
[00:22:00]  Yep.  Exaggerations in stereotypes can create artificial differences among people and provide a justification to treat groups of people in a certain way.  Artificial differences.  People are different.  Why can't we get that through our heads that people are different?  White people and black people, Asians, people of other ethnic backgrounds, Russians, people from different areas in the world, different countries are different. 
[00:22:30]  You're raised different.  You have different – just different things in your DNA.  You're just different.  We have different instincts as human beings.  Until we accept ourselves as animals on this planet, we're just doomed to this political correctness.  We're all animals and we grow up and we still have certain instincts in us. 
[00:23:00]  And those won't go away.  And it's amazing how the same morons that throw this around and say that no one is different, we're all exactly the same, are the same dopes that scream cultural diversity is important.  Right.  Well, where is cultural diversity?  If everybody's the same, why should I acknowledge your culture?  Let's just be the same and not have any different things for different groups.  Yeah, if I don't acknowledge your culture, if I think, you know, I don't want to hear I'm an American, all of a sudden you're a racist and you're intolerant.  But if I say, you know what, I've seen your culture, I think it's kind of stupid, then you're racist and intolerant. 
[00:23:30]  You can't win.  You can't.  Negative stereotypes and prejudices can lead to discriminatory behavior.  Oh, this is –  Ranging from slurs to hate crimes.  In the modern era, negative stereotypes and prejudices have resulted in the internment of Japanese Americans in WW2.  On this day.  Yeah, 65 years ago.  On this day.  65 years ago.  December 7th, where 65 years ago, Pearl Harbor was invaded by a bunch of Puerto Ricans. 
[00:24:00]  By a bunch of never-to-be-named ethnic peoples from some nation.  Some nation.  Was every plane full of a Japanese – can we just say that 65 years ago, every plane that flew and dropped bombs on Pearl Harbor had a Japanese person in it?  I think the best you could do is say that the people that did this to this fine country of ours were a bunch of people that were squinting a lot because they think the sun was bright that day. 
[00:24:30]  That could have happened, too.  And the internment of Japanese Americans was wrong.  And everybody knows it was wrong.  So why even mention it in the pamphlet?  It was a bad reaction.  Yeah, they actually made it.  50 years ago.  And unless you were there then and in that situation that this country was in, I don't think you could make that judgment if it was bad or good.  It was the time.  It was – people were afraid of spies.  We didn't have the intelligence, the technology we have now to monitor people and groups like we do now. 
[00:25:00]  And we still get screwed, you know, so someone's idea was round them up, round them up, and put them somewhere where we can keep an eye on them.  And, yeah, it turned out to be something that was really terrible, innocent people having to live in internment camps.  Yeah.  Sorry it happened.  But, again, it was planes full of Japanese that dropped those bombs.  We've got to move forward because we've got to play the blank game and everything else. 
[00:25:30]  And we have to take a break, but really fast.  Today, the use of racial and ethnic stereotypes creates, contributes, and reinforces expectations that people of certain ethnic or racial backgrounds will behave in a certain way, will live or not live in a certain part of town, and will have or not have certain kinds of jobs.  This is written by a bunch of –  White lawyers.  White lawyers in Washington that probably live in gated communities.  Of course they do.  With a few black attorneys who have the right inflection to fit into their group. 
[00:26:00]  Exactly.  And a few women who they have deemed worthy of filling a quota.  We know what you do.  If these guys believe in their own stupid pamphlet, we all know Washington has some major, major dark areas.  Move.  Why don't you show an open mind and lead by example and move that fine house and that fine white community.  Move your law offices into a really bad neighborhood.  Why don't you set the example?  Yeah.  Lawyer, dude.  You go ahead.  You do it first.  We'll follow.  Yeah, we'll follow.  But this was probably, you know, finished in a mansion somewhere in the suburbs as he's looking at other mansions and his white neighbors. 
[00:26:30]  And it says here –  Such a hypocrite.  Even the stereotypes intended to be humorous or perhaps positive in nature can cause unforeseen discrimination and limitations on opportunities and expectations.  And here's the examples.  Asian Americans are excellent at science.  Jews are great doctors.  African Americans dance well.  You know what?  All Asians are good at science.  Jews have proven to be good doctors. 
[00:27:00]  And they like that.  You point that out, by the way.  Absolutely.  We all like positive stereotypes, but we don't like the negative ones.  Tough crap.  But the African Americans, what a bunch of poohahs they are in Washington because you know the example they wanted to use.  Well, do you know –  Oh, yeah.  That they're well hung, but no, we can't have that in a pamphlet.  Harumph, harumph, harumph.  Harumph, harumph.  So we'll say they're good dancers.  Get that out, harumph.  Do you notice even the subtle racism of the dumb lawyer writing this?  Right.  They give the Asian and the Jews great mind-oriented stereotypes, and they give blacks your great dancers. 
[00:27:30]  I don't care why they use that.  That good rhythm.  Couldn't you find an example of black people using their mind in your stupid pamphlet?  Because there are white lawyers and they got scared because the reality is African Americans dance well.  Well, no one says that really.  Well, they do, but, I mean, so what?  I mean, when you're thinking about positive stereotypes,  as far as African Americans go, dance well doesn't really come to mind.  It's there, but it's not –  Sports.  You go sports.  You go with their junk is larger. 
[00:28:00]  Right.  There's a bunch of others.  You know, they don't believe in, you know, staying with their woman.  The good one?  I just love the fact –  Yeah, it's a good one if you're an African American guy.  They give the Asians and the Jews these brilliant stereotypes, and they throw the blacks a dancing.  Yeah.  Good point, Jim.  Good point.  There's – yeah.  There's Asians sending people off into outer space and Jews curing some of the most horrific diseases  as some poor black guy does the soft shoe and entertains them. 
[00:28:30]  Jeez.  All right.  Well –  It's really mind-boggling.  Well, this leads us to the little test we have to do.  Yeah.  And the listeners are going to have a ball doing the test along with us.  It's a fill-in-the-blanks.  Let's just put it this way.  We'll give you the first one as we go to break.  All male hairdressers are blank.  Hmm.  Yes, you rock? 
[00:29:00]  We'll just go to break with that.  Ah, right.  Because they're thinking in their cars and in their showers and whatever they do.  They're still in bed.  Don't hit the snooze alarm.  Just get the F up and start your day.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony will be appearing on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno Thursday, December 21st.  Jim Norton will be tagging along for no good reason other than to get a free trip to Los Angeles.  That's Opie and Anthony on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno Thursday, December 21st.  Check local listings for showtimes.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and Live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern. 
[00:29:30]  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony!  Coming Saturday, December 9th at midnight, The Fan and Sam Show.  One's a comic genius.  The other has no concept of what works on radio.  Wait, so which one is...  It's a meeting of the minds as extreme intelligence meets mental retardation. 
[00:30:00]  Who's the retard?  Our phone screener?  One is reasonable looking.  The other is a dog-faced freak.  I thought we were both pretty handsome.  One is on the tall side.  The other is average, if not slightly below.  What, you mean in height?  Than, am I the...  Just let the man finish.  The Fan and Sam Show.  Saturday, December 9th at midnight.  Sunshine, lollipops and rainbows.  Everything that's wonderful is what I feel when we're together. 
[00:30:30]  All right, we got to get right back into this.  Good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  And we're fired up today because...  We were handed booklets.  We were handed a booklet.  Anytime the lawyers hand us booklets, we get fired up.  When is the last time a lawyer handed you something that helped you be funny?  That was good.  I would like to know if anyone can think of an example of your job.  Has a lawyer ever handed you something on a corporation that has helped you? 
[00:31:00]  And Stan just kind of opened his arms like, well, this, you idiots.  And he's correct, but we're making fun of it.  But I mean, by honestly taking the advice...  You know what, though?  That lawyer was very helpful.  No other radio show has the balls to actually talk about this on the air.  They would read this behind the scenes like, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  They're serious this time.  Believe me, we're not the only ones that got this.  It's everybody that works for the company.  Lawyers are buzzkills.  I've been arguing this for a while.  And Jimmy, of course. 
[00:31:30]  You've got to add Jimmy to this whole conversation.  I object.  But no.  You're stereotyping.  I just want to screw it up like a lawyer would.  All I'm saying is over the years, we've been told no so many times.  We can't even count that high.  And I would always argue to the lawyers and the bigwigs at the company.  I'm like, look, the lawyer's job, as far as the Opie and Anthony show goes,  should be how they should figure out how we could do things and keep us safe from the FCC.  But there's such panicky peats down there. 
[00:32:00]  As soon as we suggest an idea that's a little edgy, a little scary, no, no, they can't do that.  No.  It's like, no, why don't you take the idea, sit on it for a day, think it over, and try to figure out how we can do it.  But that's your job.  That's your job.  So we're in the middle of words, hurt, and harm.  This is a pamphlet, a primer for on-air talent and programming personnel,  how to develop greater awareness of and learn to avoid the use of racial and ethnic stereotypes and slurs. 
[00:32:30]  We're up to the little exam we all have to take here.  Yes.  Anthony, you want to take this over here?  How can you become more aware of your own biases and assumptions?  Stereotypes are easy to fall back on, but are inaccurate and harmful.  Yep.  Inaccurate.  Are they?  Inaccurate.  Yes, they are all inaccurate.  All of us have built-in biases.  What are yours?  Complete the following sentences.  All right.  Here we go.  It's a little game.  And you play along at home, of course. 
[00:33:00]  The first one.  Are we ready, panel?  Are we ready?  Yes.  All right.  All male hairdressers are blank.  All male hairdressers are blank.  What if we know the answer?  Can I see everybody writing, jotting down their answers?  All male hairdressers are blank.  All except for Ralph.  All except for Ralph.  Right, of course. 
[00:33:30]  That does a fine job in Centiport cutting hair.  All except for Ralph.  That's what I say.  That's my answer.  All except for Ralph.  I've seen the pictures of his kids right there next to the mirror.  Well.  But every single other one?  Absolutely.  All male hairdressers are blank.  Okay.  Everybody got their answers?  Yes.  All right.  I'm going to start.  You could cut the music. 
[00:34:00]  I think they stopped the music once they started actually giving me answers.  Jesus Christ, Iraq.  Could you watch an old show?  Exactly.  Can I start with one from the instant feedback?  Please, please, please, please, please, please, please.  Can you do the question and I'll fill it in with the instant feedback?  All right.  Opie, all male hairdressers are, according to Bert from Philly, scared of Kenny's brush  fire hair.  That could be true.  I'd like to give mine.  I don't know if I matched anybody, but I said all male hairdressers are d***s. 
[00:34:30]  No?  I don't think I matched anyone on that one.  Steven for Basher, all male hairdressers are festive.  I put all male hairdressers are nice.  Very good.  Is that the right answer?  It could be.  Well, I had that or I had all male hairdressers and I put in parentheses vagina haters.  See, I think yours is a stereotype, Jimmy. 
[00:35:00]  Boobieman from Brooklyn, all male hairdressers are not dropping T-cells like falling hair.  See, I don't know.  I might have.  I had this.  Is this correct?  All male hairdressers are, and I put under eight feet tall.  I think you're right.  Big Doody's Jay from Jersey, all male hairdressers are power bottoms.  And flamboyant butt pirates are coming in a lot, too, there. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  I think what they're going for here was gay.  Gay.  Oh, I got that right.  I scratched it out.  That was the answer.  I had originally written poodle owners.  Ah, well, okay.  I scratched it out.  Broth drinkers.  Robe wearers.  Broadway lovers.  Yes.  See, they're going for a stereotype right there. 
[00:36:00]  What made them even write that as the lawyers?  What made them even write that?  I don't know.  Why would they say hairdressers and connect male hairdressers to any type of a stereotype?  I've never heard one.  Neither have I.  No.  What's the next one?  I think this next one has got me stumped.  This is a tough one.  This is a tough one.  All right.  All right.  Stars, are we all ready?  Yes.  I'm ready.  All right.  Waiters in Chinese restaurants are blank.  Waiters in Chinese restaurants are blank. 
[00:36:30]  Now, remember, this is coming from the lawyer's booklet that was handed out to us, Words, Hurt, and Harm.  This is a primer for on-air talent and programming personnel, how to develop greater awareness of and learn to avoid the use of racial and ethnic stereotypes and slurs.  We got this hot off the presses last night, and these are some of the stereotypes they want us to avoid.  Well, Anthony, the answers are coming in.  I want to go to Pal Talk for this one.  All right.  Doughboy says, illegally here. 
[00:37:00]  Ooh.  Wow.  A few of them, I think.  Waiters in Chinese restaurants are illegally here, according to Doughboy off Pal Talk.  I had a different answer.  All right.  I put redheaded Jews.  Oh.  Oh, Jimmy.  Jimmy didn't match anybody.  Well, they're also saying on Pal Talk, ex-pet owners.  Waiters in Chinese restaurants, I'm going to say, are good waiters, lest they be sent to the Yankee Cranky shop. 
[00:37:30]  I don't know if I'm having my questions mixed up.  The second question, waiters in Chinese restaurants are faggots?  No.  Oh, you're all mixed up.  Oh, okay.  See, let me try one.  Waiters in Chinese restaurants are brought over in shipping containers. 
[00:38:00]  Hey, there you go.  All right.  Are hung like a wonton noodle?  Yeah.  See?  Oh, these are easy questions.  I know.  You want to go on to the next one?  Yes.  Or do some listeners have...  Well, they had some SARS, you know.  A bunch of SARS answers, yeah.  SARS carriers, you know.  Oh, terrible drivers.  Gamblers.  They're saying.  Yeah, gamblers are coming in. 
[00:38:30]  Smokers.  No, that's the other, the hairdressers.  Smokers, but not that.  It went by too fast.  I can't give you credit.  But someone said waiters in Chinese restaurants are bird lickers.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Well, you want to go to the third one?  Waiters in Chinese restaurants are sad, happy, who knows?  Who can tell?  Yeah, all right.  Let's go on to the next one.  All right. 
[00:39:00]  Mm-hmm.  Ready?  Got your pens and brand new cards out in front of you?  Yes.  Write down your answers, uh, SARS.  He drinks a lot, so he must be blank.  He drinks a lot, so he must be blank.  I know that one.  Oh, oh, well, write them down.  Take a little time.  All right.  He drinks a lot, so he must be blank.  My dad is coming in a lot. 
[00:39:30]  Oh.  He's coming in a lot.  Inside joke from a pal talk Irish Alky.  Irish Alky, okay.  Friend of ours.  Yeah.  Everyone's saying that.  All right.  He drinks a lot, so he must be blank.  Everybody ready?  Yes.  Yes.  Jimmy?  A dirty Mexican.  Oh.  Damn.  You're not very good at the stereotype game.  I'm going to go with the obvious.  Mel Gibson.  All right.  Yeah. 
[00:40:00]  He drinks a lot, so he must be Mel Gibson.  These questions are confusing.  Which one is this?  He drinks a lot, so he must be...  A slope.  No.  Insing by one each time.  Instant feedback coming in like crazy.  Booby Man says, from Brooklyn, what's the question again, Ant?  He drinks a lot, so he must be...  Hitting his wife.  He drinks a lot, so he must be with a tranny in a Saturn. 
[00:40:30]  That would be...  He drank a lot.  Right.  And when he quit, he decided to switch addictions, so he must be...  He drinks a lot, so he must be Anthony's ex.  No.  It would have been she drinks a lot.  But you never know.  She might have took your money and got a sex change.  All right.  There you go.  He drinks a lot, so he must be doing production.  He drinks a lot, so he must be Tracy Morgan. 
[00:41:00]  I got one.  A CBS radio executive.  All right.  Very good.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Drinks a lot, so he must be a gossip columnist.  All right.  Should we move on?  Oh, sure.  Sure.  All right.  Next question.  Everybody ready?  This is an actual exam that they want on-air personalities to take.  Don't be fooled by this as a little bit.  This is actually in this pamphlet that the lawyers handed us. 
[00:41:30]  We're supposed to take this seriously.  Yeah.  Ready, Cass?  Here we go.  Yep.  NFL players, football players, excuse me, NFL football players are known to be  blank.  Hmm.  NFL football players are known to be blank.  No?  Ah, wow.  Quick.  Ah.  NFL football players. 
[00:42:00]  As opposed to NFL baseball players, stupid lawyers.  Jews don't know sports.  They really don't.  Oh, sorry.  National football league football players, you redundant boars.  That's like putting douchey lawyers in the same sentence.  What a bunch of stupid, tie-wearing, old white guys you are.  NFL football players, and in parentheses, not basketball, NBA, or baseball, MLB.  That play football. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  Well, Wife Killers is coming in a lot.  Wow.  Yeah.  Hey, correct.  You matched.  Yeah, that's a very good one.  That might be the top answer today.  Are we doing Family Feud?  That's a little combo, isn't it?  It's a combo of everything today.  Is this right?  I have, or all known to be, I put, having sex with Dr. Ian Smith.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  You went old school.  I love it.  I love it. 
[00:43:00]  I'm going to go with gay.  No.  Oh, you don't know.  That, they're not.  They're all men.  But they're wide receivers.  That old gay.  Well, you know.  All NFL football players are known to be.  That's a pretty wide-ranging, like, NFL football players are known to be rapists?  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, let's go with rapists. 
[00:43:30]  I'll go with rapists.  Steroid users.  Yeah, well.  Swoogies.  That's a good one.  Well hung.  Good.  All right.  Let's move on.  That one.  All right.  That one's boring.  Unfortunately, gang, we've reached our last question.  We're about out of time for this portion of our game.  Okay.  Jewish mothers are typically blank.  Jewish?  Jewish mothers are typically blank. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  I wish we were over at XM.  Wow.  That didn't take long.  The old C word.  Oh, my God.  I certainly would have thought some of the other stereotypes would have gotten a lot worse answers.  But Jewish mothers are typically blank.  Oh, my God.  There's only one answer coming in, Anthony.  Wow.  Holy Jesus.  You people are brutal.  Uh-huh. 
[00:44:30]  Mm-hmm.  There are some really awful ones.  Yes, Jimmy.  Jimmy's got an answer.  Jewish mothers are typically Jews.  That is correct.  They would be Jews.  Bad at sex is coming in.  That's coming in.  Irritating, obsessive, talkative, doting.  Can't remember the last time they gave.  Yentes is coming in. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  Tony from his Subaru.  Chicken soup pushing blank.  And, yes, it's the worst word you could say.  Ah, yeah.  I still say that word is a lot worse than the end.  Wow.  As far as bad words to say.  All right.  Well, Jesus.  I can't even read some of these with the beef.  Filled with Muslim blank.  Are you out of your mind?  Horrible.  Are you kidding? 
[00:45:30]  What?  What, what, what, what, what?  You know, I think we've covered every one of these without one stereotype.  And it's 18,000 times more offensive than if we just would have thrown in the stereotype.  I think we've done a good job so far of being open-minded and broad-minded.  Right.  Exactly.  That's right.  All right.  Well, how do these assumptions underlying these biases and stereotypes, beliefs, affect your behavior?  See, that's what they're trying to do. 
[00:46:00]  I know when I go to the hair salon, I like having a girl shampoo my hair.  Yeah.  I just do.  Because it says all male hairdressers are blank.  And you're supposed to say gay.  Right.  But that is not true.  Most male hairdressers are gay.  Almost all male hairdressers are gay.  It doesn't matter what city you go to in America.  And if you took a poll, that's what you would find out.  And the ones that aren't gay are dead. 
[00:46:30]  All right.  Waiters in Chinese restaurants?  What's that supposed to be?  I don't know.  Like the lawyers thought something up and had a little laugh, I guess, at that stereotype because they got it.  I don't get what waiters in Chinese restaurants are.  Is it bad drivers?  No.  They want us to say gooks.  What?  You think?  Yes.  No.  They want us to say the worst thing we're thinking in our brains. 
[00:47:00]  But they can't come up with a good example.  I don't think so because that's not really a – that's a slur.  These are stereotypes.  Of behaviors.  So it's got to be behaviors.  Waiters in Chinese restaurants are poor speakers of English.  Okay, yeah.  There you go.  I mean, like speaking but are something.  There you go.  I don't know what we're going for with that one.  Well, they probably had a little lunch in a Chinese restaurant.  Their little private joke.  The answer was waiters in Chinese restaurants are late with the beef and broccoli today. 
[00:47:30]  Put it on your tab.  I'll deduct it.  I never knew you were a hairdresser.  All right.  All right.  Should we move on?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  I think Fan was holding up a sign that said –  We'll continue, man.  Words hurt and harm.  We'll continue with the pamphlet that the lawyers handed us this morning.  Very helpful.  Yeah, it sure is. 
[00:48:00]  It's going to help our show.  I know it.  Has already.  Wait until we get to the positive stereotypes.  Yeah.  Oh, they're just terrific.  Let's step aside.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The 2006 Eggnog Challenge will replay on Friday, December 22nd, the day after Opie and Anthony's appearance on The Tonight Show.  For a video of the 2006 Eggnog Challenge, including the infamous Pat Kumunaki's Baby Bird video, go to opieandanthony.com or foundrymusic.com.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:48:30]  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony!  That's right.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hope you're enjoying what you're hearing today.  If you're just tuning in, ah, what are you doing?  We're on fire today.  And today, at 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. here on Free FM in New York, Bob Grant is doing a one-hour show.  And if you don't know Bob Grant, you're a dope and you should listen to him.  Legend.  Yeah, it's going to be pretty cool.  I really wish I'd be here to see him. 
[00:49:00]  He's a legendary broadcaster doing an hour today at this fine station in New York City.  Boy, is he crazy.  He's got to be wound up.  Oh, yeah.  Like, he's got quite a lot of material to get to.  Yeah, well, hand him this pamphlet.  Yeah.  He would be right there with us.  Words, hurt, and harm.  A primer for on-air talent and programming personnel.  How to develop greater awareness of and learn to avoid the use of racial and ethnic stereotypes and slurs.  Yeah, the lawyers handed this to us, and lawyers just know, they know how to bring the funny, I like to say. 
[00:49:30]  Bring the funny.  They have a fresh approach.  Yeah.  Where are we up to in this fine pamphlet?  What can you do to become part of the solution in dispelling racial and ethnic stereotypes?  The final what?  Yeah.  Boy, were we right there.  Oh, okay.  I thought we were going to hit bumpers merging out of that highway together.  Exactly. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, well.  I was taking the old joke road.  You came up Hilarity Avenue.  They want us to be leaders.  They want us to be the leaders out there.  Yeah, we're supposed to set an example.  We want us to lead you people and show you the way.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The show that killed off the mayor of Boston.  That's right.  That brought you sex at one of the most holiest churches ever.  We laughed at religion.  That took young girls and threw them in 55-gallon drums and covered them with despicable items. 
[00:50:30]  Don't forget young teen girls in the voyeur bus.  That took young girls in a transparent bus to bathe in front of the mayor's house.  We're supposed to now all of a sudden set an example.  Had one man vomit into the mouth of another man just the other day.  The show that gave you the baby bird.  That's right.  We are supposed to lead you people.  Yes.  And show you that this whole thing is wrong.  All right.  What can you do to become part of the solution?  There's no final there, Jimmy. 
[00:51:00]  No.  In dispelling racial and ethnic stereotypes.  And guess what?  We get to play another game here.  There's more questions we have to answer.  I like games.  At least they made it full of games.  This is like a highlights magazine at the doctor's office.  Racial and ethnic stereotypes are major problems in U.S. society.  Rufus and gallant.  Yeah.  It may seem frustrating as an individual to try to solve this problem.  And then they go on to say, have these thoughts ever popped into your head?  Oh, boy.  All right.  Start the music. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, no.  Well, yeah, music after the question.  Yeah.  It doesn't really matter.  Either way, we were doing it that way before.  Ant's the game show host.  I apologize, Ant.  Good.  Okay.  Yeah, music.  I like the music.  All right.  Okay, ready?  Yes.  Just what do these people want anyway?  We have to answer that question?  Just what do these people want anyway?  Hmm.  Hmm.  James from Connecticut.  Very early with his answer.  Yeah.  To kill the blacks and Jews. 
[00:52:00]  That can't possibly be it.  Is he talking?  Who is he talking about?  I don't know, man.  Just what do these people want anyway?  To sell the show until we have one minute per break to talk.  Oh, see?  He's talking about the lawyers.  I get it.  I don't have an answer.  I'm just going to say, just what do these people want anyway?  Well, this answer coming in off pal talk.  Ass sex. 
[00:52:30]  Al, I'm not sure if you were able to say that.  I was just testing Al.  Al.  Al.  You're back there on the button, Al.  You were getting a little too comfortable back there, Al.  Okay, Al.  All right, Al.  Calm back down.  Sit back down in your chair.  I know how his people like to drink.  I don't know what Al is.  Oh, my God.  Another one that has to be said because of that GM.  Lesbians that give you morning hard-ons. 
[00:53:00]  Just what do these people want anyway?  Well, listen, I know we dumped out, but just to bring everyone on board,  it was the discussion we had about the GM and what happens to him  when he hears sexual content on the radio.  And we know what he wants.  We tied that nicely together with just what do these people want anyway.  All right.  All right.  Should we move on?  Yeah.  Are you nuts taking the pal talk off my screen, E-Rock? 
[00:53:30]  Oh.  Do you have a brain ever?  E-Rock.  The listeners are helping us out right now with this part of the show.  Each of them are.  We depend on the listeners.  All right.  Go ahead, Anthony.  E-Rock.  All right.  Just what do these people want anyway?  By the way, what was that supposed to be?  It's saying that maybe you're more of a problem than you think.  Maybe you're not a part of the solution if you had these thoughts.  All right.  These are not healthy. 
[00:54:00]  These are not helpful thoughts.  Oh, I get it now.  Oh.  And just what do these people want anyway?  Our white women.  That's the correct answer.  That a boy.  Okay.  To control the media.  For the R's and L's in our language to be interchangeable.  To come into this country without signing any documents. 
[00:54:30]  All right.  Are we ready?  The next question.  Well, segregation was coming in like crazy.  It's got to be acknowledged here.  To get married.  All right.  Other ethnic groups had to struggle.  Why is it so different for this group?  Other ethnic groups had to struggle.  Why is it so different for this group?  God, I use that one all the time.  Yeah.  I use that all the time.  You know, because you're ancestors.  Every person listening has had that thought. 
[00:55:00]  Had their problems when they're new to a country.  And why is this group so different?  Well, my pamphlet or somebody wrote it.  It said, C. Michael Richards.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  I don't think this one works in the game format as much as the other ones.  Well, but, you know.  I like the fill in the blank one better, but this is fun.  Yeah.  And this annoys me the way they wrote it.  Like you're wrong to think all these things.  Yeah.  Or you're part of the problem if you've ever thought these things. 
[00:55:30]  Angry minorities make me feel defenseless and angry.  What?  Angry minorities make me feel defenseless and angry.  Have you ever thought that?  You're part of the problem.  Well, yeah.  I've also thought that writing the same thing twice is a sign of bad writing.  You know?  Yeah.  Here's one.  I should not be held responsible for my ancestors' behaviors.  We were saying that during the whole Cramer discussion. 
[00:56:00]  Is that a problem?  With that chick that called in.  What was her name?  Tina?  A week or two ago?  Or maybe they're saying, I don't think they're making a judgment on this.  They're saying it may seem frustrating as an individual to try and solve this problem.  Have these thoughts that have popped into your head?  Maybe they're just giving some examples of the fact that you do feel frustrated and you  don't even realize it.  And I am not personally responsible for stereotypes that exist in this society.  It's true.  That is so true.  I thought that just this morning.  I am when I talk with my hands. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  I just thought of that this morning as my Asian friend and I were throwing that firstborn daughter  into the river.  No, no, no, but it's true.  They don't like the girls.  My Jewish friend and I were saying that we are not responsible for stereotypes and then  we controlled the media together.  That's the twoiest.  And now they're saying it's our responsibility to... 
[00:57:00]  We're very responsible.  Yeah, you may sometimes assume that racism is an individual matter rather than one of  general applicability, even if you have never had any of these thoughts because of your  influence as a radio personality or programmer, you have the responsibility and power to affect  positive change by curbing the use of stereotypes as well as the perpetuation of discrimination  and racism.  What?  As important players in the mass...  We're important players in the mass media?  Important players, O.P. 
[00:57:30]  Your power is greatly enhanced by your ability to reach your listeners who respect your opinions  and value what you have to say.  Well...  So stereotypes have been happening since the beginning of time, but shock jocks are going  to make the change, right?  I think there's a stereotype here that people respect our opinions.  That's a stereotype.  Just because we're on the air, people respect our opinions?  They don't respect...  That is a stereotype.  I think most of the time they look at their radio and go, what a bunch of dopes.  These guys are idiots.  Hey, Opie's not responsible for the actions of All the Way May. 
[00:58:00]  Why?  Why?  Why today of all days?  Why?  Let her rest one day, please.  All the Way May, because it's December 7th.  That was a day that lived in infamy.  Absolutely.  All the Way May played Pearl Harbor that day.  She laid down.  You know the rest of the joke.  Thank you.  I haven't used that joke since I was in eighth grade.  Oh, I know.  All the Way May.  We have a special role, you know, in the media.  We don't necessarily create stereotypes, but it plays an enormous role in perpetuating and  reinforcing them. 
[00:58:30]  That's what we're doing.  The media also does not create cultural values and attitudes, but it draws upon existing  ones.  We amplify and re-channel thoughts that target audience and culture already share, that the  target audience and culture already share.  So we're perpetuating these things if we do breaks like this.  Movies, television, magazines, books, all sources of stereotyped characters.  Ethnic appearances in media by people who are not white.  Why people who are not white? 
[00:59:00]  And part of mainstream American culture.  It's because it's written by guilty, superior white people.  Let me give you a stereotype of a white guy.  Look at any of these dopey movies where he just plays a dope or dopey TV shows where the  father's a white guy and he's a dolt.  How about the goofy white guy dancing horribly in everyone?  How about Steve Martin in Bringing Down the House doing the goofy white guy dance?  Now that doesn't hurt white people, but why not address it? 
[00:59:30]  Why not at least lump it in with ethnic stereotypes, you faggots?  Because white people can't dance.  It's funny to see a white guy trying to dance with black people because they can dance.  And why are they saying this is rare?  Turn on your local news.  You're going to get the Asian newswoman or the Asian reporter.  You're going to have the white dude at the desk.  You're going to have the black guy doing sports.  You're going to have the gay guy doing weather.  Deaf girl doing the deaf stories.  Doing the handicapped people.  Handicapped stories.  But every local news program runs the gamut. 
[01:00:00]  They try to get as many different people in there as possible.  Accordingly, it's understandable that the stereotypical portrayals can be offensive to people of underrepresented races and ethnicities and to the community as a whole.  Even a seemingly good stereotype example.  I love this example.  Hardworking Latin American immigrants can be hurtful.  That's what you think of when you think of it. 
[01:00:30]  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Mix that up.  Yeah, that's the most positive stereotype I can think of.  Many ethnicities are excluded from regular roles on television or in movies, or their roles are limited to stereotypical portrayals.  For example, Italian Americans belong to the mafia.  There you go.  Can I raise a little point?  That to be a made member of the mafia, you have to be Italian.  You have to be full-blooded Italian.  You absolutely, they go back and check your lineage, have to be Italian. 
[01:01:00]  So, you dummies, who else is going to play them?  Who's going to play mafia guys except Italians?  And that doesn't necessarily mean every Italian actor has only played mafia roles.  Yeah.  It doesn't happen.  What are they supposed to be?  Asian American men are villains, martial arts experts, gentlemen, or speak broken English. 
[01:01:30]  See, now why are they just listing facts?  This is supposed to be helpful.  And they're listing a bunch of facts.  You know what?  We should send someone down to the street and just talk to five Asian people that walk by.  And one of these things will be true.  Every single time.  Every single time.  Street gangs are composed of African Americans.  Correct.  That is not all true, because street gangs are also composed of Latinos, and there are Asian street gangs. 
[01:02:00]  Yes.  And there are white supremacist street gangs.  Not that many.  Not many.  But it's hard to be a street gang when you're out there.  You usually have to cower in the woods somewhere and burn a cross.  They're a yard gang.  They hang behind those shacks with men of similar ilk.  Right.  And drink warm beverages.  Someone is saying, hey, what about West Side Story?  Right.  The Sharks.  Courtroom lawyers are Jewish.  They certainly are.  Oh, my God.  For the most part, lawyers are Jewish. 
[01:02:30]  Mm-hmm.  Let's see.  We never say all terrorists wear turbans.  Dude, that is the oldest stereotype.  Ever since 9-11, I think we understand that a turban are worn by Sikhs.  And not terrorists.  Right.  Not like Middle Eastern terrorists.  We understand that.  A lot of people didn't know that after 9-11.  We had to be educated on that point.  The derogatory term raghead isn't necessarily a turban. 
[01:03:00]  It could be that Yasser Arafat-type towel that was on his head.  That's more of a towel head or a rag than a turban would be.  And I don't know why anybody would really think terrorists, I mean, do wear turbans, considering  no photos of Bin Laden or Al-Zawari have turbans in them.  No.  And photos of Al-Zarqawi.  He was never wearing a turban.  No.  Matter of fact, they were wearing, like, Yankee baseball caps.  Yeah.  When I saw them.  Why would you think that?  Why would you think terrorists have turbans or Islamic? 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  Latin American.  One of my, this last one's my favorite.  Yeah.  Latin Americans talk with an accent and eat beans.  They wrote that.  I would get that tattooed on myself.  It's so true.  They wrote that.  See, living in Manhattan, you get to go to all these ethnic restaurants and, you know,  you go to, like, a Latin American-type restaurant.  They're not serving pasta.  Can I have the beans?  They got rice and beans for you.  But they got other things.  It's not just, I wouldn't look at a Latin American and say, I would think, you know, 
[01:04:00]  yeah, they talk with an accent.  Sure.  Okay, because you do.  But you eat beans.  They also eat rice.  They definitely like some beef, I bet.  They like a little guacamole.  In that burrito.  Guacamole.  Guacamole.  A little salsa.  And a lot of them do talk with an accent.  If they don't talk with an accent of any kind, why then every time I pick up the goddamn  telephone do they give me, for Espanol, plus two?  Yeah.  Why is that option everywhere in this country if they don't talk with an accent? 
[01:04:30]  And not even first generation.  No.  Like second generation also.  Yeah.  So, yeah, it's kind of.  I can't pick up the phone without hearing that.  I know.  Wow.  I can't pick up a prostitute without her asking me a question about that.  With an accent.  The media routinely takes advantage of ethnic or racial stereotypes as shorthand to convey  a mood, scene, or character.  Personalities on TV, cable, and radio use stereotypes to get a quick laugh.  Make it sound cheap. 
[01:05:00]  When the joke is on racial or ethnic groups, the target groups feel dehumanized, offended,  and resentful.  Do they?  Can you make that decision, Mr. White Lawyer?  Mr. White Lawyer.  In a nice office or your lovely house.  White D.C.  Lawyer.  You're speaking for everybody that a black guy can't enjoy a black joke, that a Hispanic  guy can't enjoy a Hispanic joke, but Carlos Mencia doesn't do well in the Spanish community,  and it's all about that.  Prior didn't do well with black people. 
[01:05:30]  Eddie Murphy didn't do well with black people.  Mooney offends black people.  Does Patrice offend black people?  I don't know.  You want to go with Woody Allen?  Did he offend Jews?  Jews were so offended by Woody Allen.  They boycotted everything he did.  Oh my God, and Paul Rodriguez, he would never make fun of Latins.  Neither did Freddie Prinze.  No comedians do.  We can go on and on.  Don't talk about comedy.  You're a bunch of boring lawyers.  You don't understand what's funny because you're not funny people.  All right, here we go.  This is what the whole pamphlet's about, and it's hidden on the bottom of page five. 
[01:06:00]  One line, bottom of page five.  And the pamphlet is barely seven pages.  And incidentally, by the way, one more thing about the comedy.  They have special Asian nights.  They have gay comedy nights.  Yeah.  They have chocolate sundaes at the Laugh Factory.  That's where they turn the stools upside down.  Four times as many people give me those ribs, you.  Oh, they're showing visibly.  Why do you have specialized nights in the comedy clubs if people don't want to hear ethnic humor? 
[01:06:30]  What is Def Jam on HBO?  What is that?  What is comedy loco?  It's all ethnic humor.  How out of touch.  All right.  Well, this is what it's all about here.  Social consciousness is also tied to the bottom line.  Thank you.  Stereotypes are harmful for financial reasons.  This is hidden on page five.  Customers will not, and it's underlined, customers will not buy products or listen to shows if they feel insulted.  That is the bulk of it. 
[01:07:00]  That should be in red on the cover of this pamphlet because that's what it's all about, and they're wrong.  That's right.  They're wrong because they're assuming that the customers who buy the products are listening to the show and being insulted.  And, again, we bring back all those comics and all their audience and how it just works and people find it funny.  And because you're a lawyer and you really don't understand humor, you don't understand that people do find humor in stereotypical jokes. 
[01:07:30]  And, look, the reality is only white people buy stuff.  Everybody else steals.  Don't give it a ring.  Are you telling me that –  I was correct, right?  I was just taking the exam.  The judges gave it a ring.  Mac is a big sponsor.  Well, the judges are white.  Yeah.  Are you telling me that someone's not going to go out and get a computer because they heard an ethnic joke?  I mean, this is just based in white fear.  It's just babies.  If you're sitting here –  Now, I can understand putting something like this out if a show is sitting there and doing nothing but sparing. 
[01:08:00]  And I heard it.  I used to hear it on WLIB.  It was a station here, a black-owned station.  And they'd have black jocks that would preach nothing but hate toward white people.  And that was some real venom.  I mean venom.  And I can understand if there's a bunch of white guys sitting around just bashing other ethnic groups and condoning violence against them. 
[01:08:30]  That's one thing.  Like we do in the back room.  Right.  We do it in the privacy of our homes, our cars, our offices.  If we had mics in the back room, yes, no one would be buying any product.  But on the air, we're professionals.  That would be the Adolph and Goebbels show.  I think it comes down to this.  You've got to spread it out among all groups.  Among all groups and keep it fun.  In the humor category.  It's light.  Right.  It's a humor show.  This isn't a news show.  We do hit on the news, but it's basically a humor show.  So when we're doing these things, it's not done to incite.  It's not done and we're thinking, wow, good, we're going to perpetuate this stereotype. 
[01:09:00]  It's a humor.  It's humor.  Sometimes it delves into dark humor.  But it's still humor.  Something lawyers just don't get.  Man, you know, we wanted to move on, but this stuff is too good because on the way, what to avoid saying on air.  Because now they've got to give you some solutions to the problem here.  And some examples.  And some examples, which are just terrific.  What to avoid saying on the air is on the way.  Also, yeah, we talk about positive stereotypes. 
[01:09:30]  What's the problem with that?  They have a problem with it.  They list it, Ope.  There's a problem.  Hey, can't do the bad, don't do the good.  That's right.  And then a final statement on the whole thing when we continue.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle all the way.  It's the 2006 homeless shopping spree.  Only on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Coming soon to a snooty mall.  Maybe one near you.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[01:10:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show will bring a busload of homeless degenerates shopping for Christmas presents.  And you, of course, are invited to watch and shop along.  The Golden Buns is going to get busy.  Immerse yourself in a time-honored tradition.  Enjoy the holiday spirit and the stench of booze and vomit as we partake in another homeless shopping spree on the Opie and Anthony Show.  What?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's a very busy morning on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Phone number 1-866-313-FREE. 
[01:10:30]  It is the virus, the ONA virus, spreading across America.  Tell your friends.  Very busy morning.  On the way, Big A wants to do the chubby bunny.  Oh, that's going to be hard to watch.  What's the current record?  13?  13 held by...  E-Rock?  Our own E-Rock?  Oh, Craig?  What?  Who?  What?  You got a mic.  Shut up.  17.  17? 
[01:11:00]  All right.  17 is the record.  We'll explain in a minute or two.  And we might be doing some news with Club Soda Kenny.  He has a way about him.  He loves bad news.  And we look through the paper and find bad news so Kenny can enjoy himself.  Loves delivering it.  Yeah, but we'll finally finish up with words hurt and harm.  A primer for on-air talent and programming personnel.  How to develop greater awareness of and learn to avoid the use of racial and ethnic stereotypes and slurs.  Handed out by the lawyers to all the air staff, I guess. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, but this is not...  Just another sign that we're doomed.  This isn't for music jocks or anything.  It's for people like you and I.  Simple as that.  Yeah?  Absolutely.  You're not getting the top 40 jocks all of a sudden yelling and screaming and using stereotypes in between their records.  Racial slurs.  They read a couple liners that have nothing to do with this.  Hey, this is a great song put out by some a** back in 1968. 
[01:12:00]  Can you imagine?  All right.  Well, now we get to...  Now they're going to suggest some things we could do.  The solution to the problem.  Uh-huh.  How can you avoid further reinforcement of racial and ethnic stereotypes?  Recognize that you have the power and responsibility to avoid racial and ethnic stereotypes.  Better recognize.  This is hilarious.  Listeners look up to radio personalities.  Do they really? 
[01:12:30]  They don't look up to us.  They don't look up to anyone in the broadcasting field.  The last guy they looked up to was Eric Boghossian in that stupid talk radio movie he did.  Yeah.  They don't look up to us.  Are you kidding me?  They know we're a bunch of dopes in general.  It's not true.  I'm a leader.  We say it every day.  You may play a leadership role in your community or be held up as a role model.  Don't look up to us.  We're stupid.  Yeah.  See, we should have a disclaimer.  Make your own decisions, people.  And then it says... 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, that's what it comes down to.  Even your...  Yeah, they're basically saying you can't figure out things for yourself.  No.  We say something stupid on the radio and all of a sudden you're going to change your mind  and start believing in different things.  It says even your presentation of comedic material can shape listeners' opinions.  Wow.  That is so not true.  It is nonsense.  People have brains that they use on a daily basis and decide for themselves.  Maybe a couple of people, but...  There might be a few, but they're just the dopes.  It's not an excuse to say that the programming was meant to be comedic or... 
[01:13:30]  Satirical?  Satirical, sorry.  It's not.  Both serious and comedic programming can reinforce listeners' already held beliefs,  but can change listeners' minds as well.  Do you see the arrogance of this?  Insane.  The arrogance of these dumb lawyers.  That's insane.  The arrogance.  Do the Vulcan mind meld on people, apparently.  Already held beliefs, but can change listeners' minds as well.  We are not that pompous to think we're going to change your minds at all. 
[01:14:00]  And another thing, that's not what I signed on for.  I didn't sign on to change people's thinking as far as racial diversity goes and sensitivity.  We signed on to do a few poopy jokes for a couple decades.  A few schlong jokes, whatever it takes to make people giggle on their commute.  A few hot conversations with hot young lesbians.  That's it.  That's what we signed up to do.  I'm not a shrink.  I'm not a cop. 
[01:14:30]  I'm not changing people's opinions.  And maybe get a few CDs in the process.  Just a few.  A couple free CDs.  Get some freebies.  And some free concert tickets.  We're not leaders.  And you guys know we're not leaders.  They're basically saying in Washington, these lawyers, that you people that listen to radio  are just plain stupid.  You're puppets.  We don't want people to agree with us.  We like to say what we say.  And then you enjoy it or hate it or do whatever you do.  Yeah.  Listen to it. 
[01:15:00]  Don't listen to it.  Whatever.  What to avoid saying on air.  Bring it back to funny.  Here we go.  Slurs.  I guess that's one of the things they don't want you using are slurs.  Right.  And then they give some examples.  And there are a bunch of pujas down there in Washington because the examples they wanted  to use was for African Americans, but they didn't have the balls.  Of course they didn't.  They didn't have the balls to go with the one that is the number one on everyone's list.  I also don't agree with one of these slurs. 
[01:15:30]  Slurs such as Chinaman.  You like that one?  Chinaman.  Yeah.  Someone just recently got in trouble for saying Chinaman.  Chinaman?  Who?  Yeah.  How could he get in trouble for saying that?  I think...  Who's talking about a Jew?  Adam.  Corolla.  Did he apologize?  Yeah, of course he did.  Why Adam?  The Asian community is getting very powerful.  Oh, enough with them already.  We got that John Liu guy in New York.  Thanks.  That's just paying close attention to what we're saying and what other people are saying about  the Chinaman.  Chinaman was a derogatory term, they say, that was used during the building of the railroad 
[01:16:00]  when they were paid very little to do a lot of work and treated like garbage.  So, Chinaman shouldn't be used to it.  It worked because those railroads are as straight as arrows.  That's right.  You've got to love it.  Job well done.  And that's because we whipped the hell out of them to make sure they did it right.  And threw them in a quicksand pit every once in a while to teach them a lesson and  say, look, if you don't continue making this straight, look what's going to happen to you.  Oh, you get your history off of Blazing Saddles. 
[01:16:30]  I get all my history from movies.  From Blazing Saddles.  Oh, my God.  I smell bit.  History from movies.  Hold on.  Just a little spark.  Got a little spark, divine spark there in your head.  Get your history from movies.  Yes.  That's too good to pass up.  What we have learned from movies about history.  That we think is real.  Oh, man, is that great.  All right, so slurs.  So Chinaman, you don't have a problem with?  No, no, no. 
[01:17:00]  That is considered a racial slur now.  Okay.  For Asian-Americans.  Which is ridiculous.  I don't agree with this one.  Oriental.  This is Oriental.  Yeah.  This was used for many years as a way to say if somebody was Asian from some Asian country,  you could have covered the whole thing.  The Orient.  Japan.  The Orient.  Anywhere.  The Orient.  Oriental is like things that don't breathe, right?  But yeah, Oriental are things.  Right.  Like you have an Oriental table. 
[01:17:30]  Right.  Or chair.  Right.  But not a person.  Right.  Right.  Different.  They're Asian.  Ew.  I don't know.  That's relatively new.  Like within the past.  Picky.  Picky.  Picky.  Picky.  Ten years or so.  That one kind of got in.  Now, gook.  They use that as an example also.  That is pretty dated.  That was used in late end of Korea and into Vietnam.  They use that.  I don't know what the – what is the origin of that word?  No idea. 
[01:18:00]  I'd never know.  I'd love to know what the origin of that word is.  Good cook.  I know what Charlie – they called him Charlie.  This is VC, Victor Charlie.  Right.  And then they just shortened it to Charlie.  So I'm going to say the Imus was the one that said Chinaman.  Was he?  Maybe we get that story.  I'm sure he did a positive.  And then slant-eyed or slant-eyed.  Yeah.  And then they got explained when referring to Asian Americans.  Asian Americans.  Well, that obviously is a derogatory term just used off of what you see. 
[01:18:30]  You know, it's a description of someone's face.  Right.  And, of course, that wouldn't be liked.  Oh, this – these – oh, my God.  People wouldn't like that.  The positive examples are just great on the next page.  Yeah.  Well, really fast.  What to avoid saying on air.  Using racial or ethnic terminology in stories or jokes where race and ethnicity are not factors.  Singling out a member of a minority group as a spokesperson for his entire ethnic or racial group. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  And accents used to mock a race, culture, or ethnic group.  I stepped all over you there, Jimmy.  I was finishing a sentence.  I apologize.  Other examples of qualifying statements include nothing against this race, but they should not allow them to drive blank.  Right.  So it's like nothing against Asians, but they shouldn't allow them to drive. 
[01:19:30]  Right.  Nothing against Irish, but they shouldn't allow them to drink.  Why?  Nothing against Italians, but they should not allow them to own guns.  Nothing against blacks, but they should not allow them to.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Exactly.  And.  Yeah.  This one. 
[01:20:00]  Other examples of qualifying statements include, and this one everyone uses.  Hey, some of my best friends are that race, but.  Yeah, but.  There's only one time you use that.  Every, every group uses that one.  Every single group uses that one.  All right.  Should we just move on?  Let's finish up here.  How to avoid good.  They say why you should avoid certain good stereotypes.  Yeah, even good stereotypes.  But even the group would say, what?  No, we enjoy the. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, my God.  Kenny.  All we're hearing is like this loud paper bag rustling.  It's rustling.  Rustling.  I thought he was running his fingers through his hair.  All right.  So why should you avoid good stereotypes?  Oh, wait.  And first, right above that, here's something they don't want us doing either.  Do not fake accents that evoke a race or culture or try to imitate a language. 
[01:21:00]  Mocking speech patterns is an example of a stereotype in action that manifests into a slur.  So you pretty much can't do an impression of, like, Jackie Chan.  Anybody ethnic.  Don't do a Jackie Chan impression.  Don't do an impression of Chris Rock because he uses kind of a black dialect when he talks and does his act.  You can't do impressions of anybody but white people, apparently. 
[01:21:30]  I like that.  Yeah.  That helps comedy.  That's it.  You lawyers stink.  I can see him typing this up.  Oy vey, what do you want to put?  Let me write how I thought they shouldn't imitate certain speech patterns.  I, my overbearing mother, told me that you didn't clean the office properly.  I'm sorry I was busy. 
[01:22:00]  Zilk!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And why is my food late?  I try to make for food, but me hit ditch the cosmic circle car.  I, uh, afraid to go through that group of people.  You, what?  You be flippin', yo.  You can ride through us.  We're gonna hurt you or nothin'. 
[01:22:30]  Anyone need a haircut?  Mmm.  Oh.  Jesus.  How ridiculous.  Isn't it ridiculous?  Uh.  All right.  Good stereotype.  Why should you avoid good stereotypes?  Some stereotypes may seem to be beneficial at first.  At first.  But then what happens?  I don't know.  Somehow the lawyers make it go bad.  No, they explain it all.  They give a very good explanation.  All right.  Why don't you take it, uh, Jimmy?  Here's the ball.  Some stereotypes may be, uh, seem to be beneficial, but they are, uh, explicitly or implicitly combined 
[01:23:00]  with bad stereotypes.  Mmm.  African Americans are not all good at sports.  See?  We assume they are.  That's true.  There are some.  That's a good stereotype.  Three who aren't.  Three who aren't.  The stereotype that African Americans are good at sports has a flip side.  You watch football on Sundays, you stupid lawyers?  Are you kidding me?  I didn't read this.  Well, the flip side is that they are less intelligent. 
[01:23:30]  What?  Holy crap.  And incidentally, can I, can the lawyers find, how about this?  Why do the lawyers have to use a sports example?  Why don't the lawyers use, uh, an example for black people that is, is mind oriented  and not sports oriented?  Wow.  That's all they've done.  This whole booklet is black people can dance, degrade black people.  Black people can dance and black people go to sports.  Like, I understand they're going after stereotypes, but why is it that the Jews get, uh, science  and the Chinese get science and doctors and lawyers, and yet blacks are stuck with sports 
[01:24:00]  and dancing.  It's sports and dancing so far in this whole pamphlet.  Why, lawyers?  Have you ever focused on the fact that if you're good at sports that you're dumb?  Has that ever really crossed your mind?  No, but apparently they think so.  Jesus.  I've actually thought that, and honest to God, my idea of the dumb jock is a white guy.  I've never thought of black and dumb jock.  Yeah.  A bunch of dumb white jocks, uh, getting drunk, cruising out in a car and wrapping themselves  around a tree.  That's who I've always seen as dumb jocks.  Stuff like that, right. 
[01:24:30]  White guys.  Do you ever, like, uh, Tiger Woods is a great example, taking over the world.  So he's, he's, he's great at golf and he's black, right?  Have you ever looked at Tiger Woods and go, he's got to be a dummy?  No, no, because he's an Asian in him.  Right.  Oh yeah, and the Asians are good at math.  That's the smart man.  And he's always calculating before he hits a, it's a little ball around the golf course.  Why can't these lawyers think of an example?  And I know that they're saying, well, if these stereotypes aren't true, why do they just  say African Americans are not all good lawyers?  Because it's a non-stereotype.  Right. 
[01:25:00]  Why, why isn't it a stereotype?  It reinforces the racist idea that African Americans are more animalistic and less human  because they are more physically able and less intelligent.  Are you insane?  Wow.  This is the crap these guys talk about behind closed doors with their scotch on the rocks.  Yep.  It's a racial stereotype to assume a tall black young man plays basketball.  Look at it.  Look, look, even when I see it, when I see a tall white guy, one of the first things I  go, well, did he play basketball in high school?  You just assume because that's what basketball coaches do. 
[01:25:30]  I was a basketball player, and unfortunately, I wasn't tall enough.  I only made it to just under...  And you're white.  Yeah, I just made it to under six foot, okay?  But man, in my high school and every high school in America, they recruit the tall people  to play basketball, whether you're white, black, or, well, Asian.  There had to be one out there.  Yeah.  So is it a racial stereotype, then, to see a short Asian and assume he doesn't play for  the NBA?  Yes.  Yeah, is that a racial stereotype to see an older Jewish man, apparently in his 40s, is 
[01:26:00]  it ageist and racist for me to say, I bet he's not a linebacker for the Giants?  You know, it is, because you just don't know.  You dopes.  All right, let's move on to the next example.  Asian American students are not all high-achieving, smart representatives of the model minority.  Model minority.  They gave him.  The good stereotype that Asian Americans are smart also perpetuates the racist concept  that they are un-American or aliens and do not fit in socially. 
[01:26:30]  Then why is Chinatown existing?  Yeah.  Why does Chinatown exist?  And how come when they get a B+, they throw themselves out a window of their dorm room?  At NYU, yeah.  Have they installed the trampolines yet?  Jesus.  Something we suggested about a year ago?  Trampolines around NYU, please.  What are the ethnic pride parades, then?  If no one can be judged on anything, what is Columbus Day?  What is our Irish parade?  What are all these ethnic parades?  If there's...  I don't understand it.  Why should they have any allegiance to each other? 
[01:27:00]  Let's start by shutting down ethnic parades.  White people stink.  Oh, we really do.  Un-American or aliens and do not fit in society.  Why?  Because they're high-achieving?  Boy, what they are saying here is that we are not high-achieving, and we represent people  that aren't a model person.  Yeah, and they're just trying to find an excuse why good stereotypes aren't bad.  Because when I think that Asians are smart and do all at school, which I do, and honestly 
[01:27:30]  the reason I think that is the parenting stresses that, and being good in school is not spit on  by other Asian students, it's not frowned on.  So I actually think that's a really great cultural thing they have, is that they're  education-oriented.  It certainly is.  I admire that.  Great work ethic.  It is a racial stereotype to presume that all Asian-American students do well in school,  excel in math or science, or tend to be submissive and compliant.  Well, then how is that a positive stereotype?  How do you put submissive and compliant as a positive stereotype, other than sexually when 
[01:28:00]  you're only a gun?  It starts with how a positive, it starts, basically what they're saying is the positive  stereotype leads to a negative stereotype.  Many Asian-American students are student leaders among their classmates, do well in fields other  than math or science, and have assertive and outgoing personalities.  But, man, I tell you.  Do you understand that they just said Asian-American students are not all high-achieving, smart representatives,  and then in the last sentence they say many Asian-American students are student leaders, do well in fields other 
[01:28:30]  than math or science, and have assertive and outgoing personalities.  They just contradicted themselves.  They're not all positive.  Some of them are terrific.  And being assertive and outgoing, that's the minority.  It just is.  Yeah, absolutely.  When you go around your daily lives, that's what you see.  It's what you see.  I'm sure there are that are assertive and leaders and all that, of course.  But there is this family, there's this very close-knit family thing that a lot of Asians have, 
[01:29:00]  and it's very, it's not really open to the outside.  You know, when you go into Chinatown and stuff, you see plenty of fun things to do and eat and stuff,  but their families are very close-knit, and they don't like when a lot of people go outside the family.  This is just the way it is.  I'm not stereotyping here.  This is a culture.  It's something that happens in their culture.  And they want to call America the cultural melting pot. 
[01:29:30]  And in one hand, these same people will say you have to respect diversity and culture  and admire and learn about other people's culture.  Yet when you identify somebody culturally and say, yeah, well, the Asians are good at math  because families stress that, that's a stereotype.  You can't win with these idiots.  All right.  The last example is just terrific.  No, it's fabulous.  Yeah, we should use the word fabulous.  Absolutely.  Gay men are not all stylish.  That's correct.  Wow. 
[01:30:00]  Some of them have to shave their arms and wear flame shirts.  Stop it.  The good stereotype that gay men are good at fashion and interior decorating reinforces the idea that they are hedonists and superficial.  And I don't know what would enforce that stereotype, Queer Eye from the String of the String.  I don't know why you would think that.  Maybe every decorating show and every makeover show and all these home rebuilder shows where they're decorating or, or they're giving poor people a house and they bring in a decorator. 
[01:30:30]  Maybe the fact that every single guy they bring in to decorate a house is gay on those shows.  Maybe that reinforces it.  And maybe every time.  And maybe that's just the way it is.  Well, that's, they are saying that's probably wrong, though.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  That they shouldn't do that on TV.  And maybe 90% of the times I go into a store to buy some kind of clothes, the man that helps me looks like he should be eating link sausage by the fistful.  The good stereotype is tied to the bad stereotype that gays are feminine and different than real men. 
[01:31:00]  Well, gay guys do have this femininity about them.  They love to cry.  Of course they do.  They cry a lot.  Not all of them.  I'm not saying all because a lot of guys, especially if they're in the closet because they don't want to come out.  Maybe they're sports figures, something like that.  They hide it, but for the most part, openly gay guys that are out of the closet are very feminine.  For the most part. 
[01:31:30]  I'm not saying all.  And to say, the stereotypes came from, you know, somewhere.  Of course they do.  They make it sound like we just decided to get in a room one day.  All right, let's make up this set of rules.  All right, look, gay.  Let's say they're all feminine.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  It came from somewhere.  It came from somewhere.  From many, many, many years of observing culture.  And you can hear someone's gay.  You know, hi, we know what you like.  Yeah.  We know what you like when you sit down.  Once again, Jimmy, for the most part. 
[01:32:00]  This is like the majority of that group.  Has anyone in this room, and I don't mean so flamboyant where you're, you know, watching the Halloween parade down in the village or something like that, gay.  But just a gentleman is walking down the street.  And you could tell by his walk and perhaps a little bit of what he's wearing that he is absolutely gay.  Of course.  There are ways that you can look at somebody and absolutely know their sexuality.  It just, it's just the way that, a woman walking down the sidewalk, with the way she's dressed, the way her hair is done, her stride. 
[01:32:30]  You can tell she is a lesbian.  It just, it's, it, that, it happens.  We're not stupid.  People dress and behave a certain way because a lot of times they want you to know what they are.  For instance, if you see somebody, a lot of Muslims fought to have headgear.  Obviously headgear, what do they call it?  I'm not sure they call it headgear, but what they wear over their heads.  Head removal gear.  But a lot of them fought to have that as transit workers. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  Or they wanted to wear like a turban or whatever they wanted to wear.  They fought for that.  Why?  It's part of their religion.  They want you to know what religion they are.  Right.  Why do Jews wear skull caps?  So you think that they're Irish?  They are dressing, showcasing their religion.  So am I being bigoted if I see a guy with a little hair lock falling down in the Diamond District wearing a black hat?  And I assume he's a Jew?  I mean, is that, is that racist?  They're called curly fries.  Oh, I'm sorry.  It's pay us.  A little piggy tail.  Oh, pay us? 
[01:33:30]  They're not called curly fries.  How ironic.  They're curly fries.  Pay us.  Pay us.  Oh, Jesus.  Geez, wow.  You know, I never thought of that.  But is that, is that, come on, man.  Is that, they're dressing a certain way to show you something.  All right.  The good stereotype, this is how they wrap this up, is wrong and unrealistic.  It creates the great difficulty of expecting people to live up to an absurd perception.  Just like any stereotype, it reduces a person's humanity.  Forcing an assumption, even a seemingly positive one, onto someone can have a harmful impact. 
[01:34:00]  But it doesn't, but it doesn't, because you're not putting the stereotype on every individual.  You're not.  You take the individual for what they are when you're having some type of interaction with the individual.  That's when you can make a basis on what that person's about.  You need to interact with a person one-to-one.  But when you, looking at a group as a whole, all you have is their culture, their past. 
[01:34:30]  Deeds?  Yeah.  What they've done.  And that's what you have to go on.  That's your first impression.  Oh, God.  This is just drivel.  The synopsis.  Dribvel.  The synopsis is very important, Anthony.  Yeah, we finally finished.  By the way, we were only going to do this for like a half hour today.  Yeah, I swear to God.  Swear to you.  This took on a life of its own today.  The phone has been lit all day because everyone has to deal with this type of crap.  Lit.  At their own jobs.  You guys all have that nonsense sensitivity training and diversity training, all this. 
[01:35:00]  And they look at white radio like where the problem, the black radio stations are doing the exact same thing.  Some people would say worse.  I don't know because I don't listen to black radio enough to form an opinion.  But this is happening all over the place.  So in summing up.  All right.  How can you use your voice and your power?  We can destroy Dantooine to show the power of this star base. 
[01:35:30]  What?  Alderaan?  Oh.  Good.  Wow, one nerd correcting another.  I can't see that.  That's Alderaan.  Creative?  We'll be number one by no time with talk like that.  No one was on, Dantooine.  What?  It's abandoned.  You might as well be speaking Korean.  Believe me.  People know.  That's right.  Well.  But they're a bunch of faggots.  And we're not looking for the faggots to listen to the show.  It's not Korean, by the way.  It's oriental talk. 
[01:36:00]  Is it?  I don't know.  It's Asian bladder.  Creative on-air talent can and should entertain and be humorous without having to use comedy  as a vehicle to denigrate other people.  You skipped a great line here, though.  Oh, I didn't see it.  It is human nature to be uncomfortable with people who seem different than we are, but  unfairness results if we treat people differently because of a stereotype.  It's human nature to be uncomfortable with people who seem different than we are.  Gee, is it?  That's interesting. 
[01:36:30]  Than we are, meaning the lawyers, rich, white, living in, yeah, gated communities.  Gated community.  Yeah.  We will become less uncomfortable with people who are different than we are if we get to  know them as individuals and not as representatives of their ethnic or racial group.  That's what we do.  Yes.  You do that.  That's what we do in life.  You can't meet everybody.  Well, I suggest these lawyers drive down around the XM complex down there in D.C.  And I suggest, and I mean this in a very genuine way, that you get out of your cars on your 
[01:37:00]  way home from work.  Leave them unlocked.  And you leave them unlocked because you can't judge a book by its cover.  Right.  And you get to know people in that neighborhood.  Shake some hands.  Get to know people.  Make some friends.  Hey, this is coming in a lot, so let's answer this question.  Anne from Staten Island.  Go ahead, Anne.  I can't believe that somebody would actually make a list like this and be sued for discrimination  themselves.  Yeah, she goes, is this pamphlet for real?  I swear to you, Anne.  Absolutely for real.  It's more a booklet than a pamphlet. 
[01:37:30]  I'd say booklet.  We got the email yesterday after the show that we all received our pamphlets on words  hurt and harm, and I was like, oh my God.  There's tomorrow's show.  It's got staples.  It's a booklet.  That's right.  Pamphlets are folded.  Of course it's ridiculous.  Of course it is.  Written by a bunch of dopey white lawyers.  They're completely out of touch.  They make a ton of money from this company, and they got to justify their worth.  Of course they do.  They're looking at this booklet as part of getting the last kid's college tuition paid  off.  Right. 
[01:38:00]  And they know nothing about comedy.  Nothing.  So, Jimmy, go with the highlighted, bold face statement.  This is the end of the booklet, guys.  This is it.  Right here.  Last paragraph.  Creative on-air talent can and should entertain and be humorous without having to use comedy  as a vehicle to denigrate other people.  I don't know if I agree with that, because when you see somebody in a wheelchair or somebody  who's retarded, how do you not want to denigrate them?  And then laugh about it with all your healthy friends after.  In humor.  Comedy's based on some horrific things at times, man.  Of course it is.  Normally.  It just is. 
[01:38:30]  On-air talent have a special and unique obligation.  We're obligated.  Because of their standing in the community not to offend their listeners.  When did that happen?  I don't know.  When all of a sudden did we have this obligation not to offend people?  We can offend people.  Anything we say on a daily basis, no matter what subject matter we cover, is going to  offend somebody out there.  Believe me.  Yeah.  We've been in this long enough to know.  We could talk about any subject matter.  Someone's going to be pissed.  Yeah.  Someone ain't going to like it.  Yeah.  So, you know what you do? 
[01:39:00]  You go about your business.  We do what we do.  We make fun of whatever we make fun of and try to eke out a good show on a daily basis.  And might I ask the dirty out of such lawyers, what about the obligation of the listeners  to use their own brains and to not pretend to be offended by humor just so they have some  sense of empowerment and they have something to talk about and they can latch on to something  and be angry?  What about their responsibility?  We all have one vote, stupid asses.  All right.  So, you got that.  All right.  The power of the media is immense.  Use it wisely to avoid perpetuating stereotypes that can lead to further prejudice, discrimination 
[01:39:30]  and hate and to challenge the minds of your listeners to open up their thinking to new  perceptions of the people in their community.  That's right.  So, we apologize for all of our black lawyer jokes and Jewish NBA stereotyping and I've  been doing it for years and I'm sorry that I've accused all you Asians of being extraordinarily  well endowed and my fault.  And we have to sign.  Never happen again.  And now we have to sign to show that we read the pamphlet from the lawyers. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, I'm keeping this one.  I'm not ripping up this gem.  There it is.  There's me signing your stupid...  Sign sealed and, oh, wait, delivered.  Anthony, it's all over the floor.  There you go.  Pick it up.  There you go.  Now clean it up.  There you go.  Be a lawyer like your father.  That's what I think of your pamphlet.  Clean it up, you spoiled brat of indiscriminate ethnic origin.  But not Italian.  All right. 
[01:40:30]  That was fun.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, we wanted to do like maybe 15 minutes, a half hour on that.  Half hour, 40 minutes tops.  Yeah, you know.  Two hours and five minutes.  Yeah.  What do we got?  Big A?  Is he here?  Big A's doing chubby bunny today.  I don't know.  Let's not judge the bunny on its size.  That's sizes.  Let's see what else.  Right.  Let's see what else America's talking about today.  Pleasantly plump bunny.  That's right.  We'll see what the rest of America's talking about today with Club Soda Canning. 
[01:41:00]  He'll do some news and we'll comment, obviously, on...  Unless it's not hurtful.  Not a lot of news today, though, man.  No.  We do have a cute story about a kid getting arrested for opening his Christmas present early.  Aw.  Aw.  We got audio.  That could be kind of cool, actually.  Well, Christmas, wait a minute.  That's kind of not inclusive.  You're right.  We should just say holiday gift.  Oh, holiday gift.  Because it could be Kwanzaa.  Oh.  Or it could be Hanukkah.  Oh, yeah.  You're right.  I don't want to...  Okay.  Yeah.  You're learning from that.  Absolutely.  I did learn a lot.  Won't be Chinese New Year because that's kind of ethnic and stereotyped. 
[01:41:30]  Right.  And culturally based.  Enough with the firecrackers and the dragon.  What year is this?  Big dragon.  A bunch of dumb feet.  Damon Wayans banned from Laugh Factory for saying the N-word.  Bunch of dumb feet.  Why would a dragon have 18 feet?  Exactly.  They're all yellow and it's shaped like a caterpillar.  It doesn't look like a dragon.  It doesn't.  Your dragon is a hairstylist.  Your dragon is a hairstylist.  It's a caterpillar role.  Oh, my God.  All you do, you're worried about being mugged by a bunch of NFL stars. 
[01:42:00]  Dick Cheney's daughter, the lesbian.  Oh, yes.  Are we allowed to say lesbians still?  Let's say women that lives an alternative lifestyle.  How about a gal that doesn't mind picking hair out of her teeth?  Sure.  She's not a lesbian.  She's an American.  Well, she's having a baby.  Aw.  Wow.  That's adorable.  Funny, her and a turkey baster have a photo taken together. 
[01:42:30]  Damon Wayans banned from Laugh Factory.  That's not very sensitive.  Jimmy?  You've got to be a little more sensitive, Jimmy.  Damon Wayans, I said this banned from Laugh Factory for saying the N-word, which is beyond ridiculous.  And books at Queen's School include homosexuality, French kissing, and cursing.  We've still got lots to do.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony will be appearing on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno Thursday, December 21st.  Jim Norton will be tagging along for no good reason other than to get a free trip to Los Angeles.

[01:43:30]  Love American Express.  So easy to do it.  Ah.  I just don't like when they, like, call you for no reason.  Hi, would you like to join the...  If I wanted to, I would.  Stop calling.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Let's say hi to Big A.  What's up, Big A?  How you been?  Not bad.  Not bad at all.  I see you have a MafiaLife.com shirt on.  Trying to promote, are you? 
[01:44:00]  Hope they're paying you well.  But they're having a big get-together at my brother's restaurant and my restaurant, FH Riley's, 400 New York Avenue on Saturday, right?  Yes.  In the heart of Huntington Village.  We've had so much energy today on this show, and now it's like Big A.  Hey, this might not be the right time to have a Big A segment, because there's no way he's keeping up today. 
[01:44:30]  How you doing?  How you doing?  It's a stutter.  Good.  Okay.  We're in NASCAR's today, and he's on a tricycle.  Yeah.  And we're on the same racetrack.  What's up, Kenny?  I'm just trying to get Big A situated.  So we're going to do a quick chubby bunny with Big A, and then we're going to do the news with Club Soda Canning, and then we're going to get the hell out of here, right?  I think that's the plan.  He can't even...  Say chubby bunny.  Chubby bunny. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, very well.  Okay.  Yeah, it's not one of those trouble words for him.  No, no.  Yeah.  But the record is 17.  Stubby bunny would be very hard.  Stubby.  Yeah, say stubby bunny.  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I don't think you said stuff, by the way.  You cheated at the end.  He does that thing where he goes...  He cheated. 
[01:45:30]  He cheated.  Hubby.  Yeah, he goes...  Hubby.  What stereotype is this, by the way, that we're making fun of?  There's six.  Three of them are down syndrome.  All right.  Chubby bunny.  Say that.  Chubby bunny.  Very easy.  Stubby bunny.  Hubby bunny. 
[01:46:00]  Wow.  Wow.  But he cheats.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He cheats now.  You're watching it.  It's like, why...  Why doesn't it come out?  Hubby.  Hubby.  That's how you say stubby, right?  All right.  I wouldn't mind...  Why don't you just not do that?  Just don't get it.  What if you slapped your face really hard in the middle of that?  Nothing?  We all did.  Doesn't...  Yeah.  Those that are subjected to hearing it.  Mm-hmm.  So, is he going to play Stubby bunny?  Do you want to?  Stubby bunny.  This story in West Palm Beach, we got this story about this lady. 
[01:46:30]  She choked to death at a county fair because she was doing the Stubby Bunny.  Chubby bunny.  Chubby bunny.  Oh, yeah.  Stubby bunny.  Chubby bunny.  Well, yeah.  Chubby bunny, basically, you put a marshmallow in your face, in your mouth, and then you say  chubby bunny.  Then you put another marshmallow in your face or mouth, and you say chubby bunny, and you  keep going until you can't do it anymore.  The current record is 17 by intern Craig.  Yep.  Is the marshmallows opened?  Yes.  Okay.  You ready to go, big guy? 
[01:47:00]  Yes, I am.  We have to wager, by the way.  Now, you know how this works.  You put a marshmallow in your mouth, and you say chubby bunny, and then you put another  chubby bunny, another, and you keep going and see how many marshmallows you can put in  your mouth, say chubby bunny, before you either choke or spit them out.  Now, if he's going to do chubby bunny, I'm going to up my bet from yesterday.  I gave it the highest I gave.  I gave E-Rock 13, and I gave Craig 17.  I'm going to give Andrew 1,411. 
[01:47:30]  He's got a big, like, gullet thing happening.  He's going to shove it.  He's shoving in the bags of marshmallows.  He's got a big pelican thing happening.  I think you could get a lot of marshmallows in there, Big A.  What do you think?  How many do you think you could do?  I think I could do maybe 15, 20, if I don't gag too much.  I'll give him 19.  Yeah, I'm going to go, man, I'm going 22, Jimmy.  Okay.  Jimmy's got 19, eh? 
[01:48:00]  Unless he's doing snubby bunny.  Then I give him one.  I know, because we'll just run out of time.  How many did you say?  19.  22.  18.  Cool.  All right.  I can say 18.  That was, that was, that's BS.  That's why you got to do a hidden.  Watch the list.  Price is right.  That's why you got to do your guess.  I did the one less.  It has to be a hidden guess.  You can't do that.  One less.  That's not nice.  That's not nice.  One dollar.  I know.  All right, here we go.  Let's go, Big A. 
[01:48:30]  Here goes the first.  Could someone help him?  He can't even get the marshmallows out of the bag, because there's just a tiny little hole,  and look how big his hands are.  No, big dumb mitts.  Big mitts.  Ooh, look at him.  All right, let's go.  Look at the smotherers.  There we go.  Put it in your mouth.  Oh, a chubby bunny.  You have to say, what's in your mouth?  Chubby bunny.  All right, that's one.  A chubby bunny. 
[01:49:00]  That's two.  Those marshmallows are screaming as they're being pushed in his mouth.  No.  Oh, boy.  He's already having a problem.  Chubby bunny.  That's three.  All right, I'm going to change my vote to seven.  I know.  God.  I'm competent.  I'm going to go with four.  Go ahead.  Chubby bunny.  That's four?  Yeah.  I'm a chubby dummy.  Yeah.  You can say chubby dummy. 
[01:49:30]  That's brilliant, actually, Jimmy.  I mean, why didn't we think of that before the contest?  He's changed it to chubby dummy.  Chubby dummy, yes.  Go ahead.  Chubby dummy.  That's five.  He's almost done.  Yeah, he certainly is.  All right, let's go.  Because he needs his mouth to breathe, by the way.  Do you?  Yes.  Well, his nose sounds good.  Oh, my God.  What's in your sinuses? 
[01:50:00]  A Bielik?  Is this number six coming up?  Yeah.  All right, here's six.  That was six, right?  That was only six.  The paramedic's praying he doesn't have to do mouth to mouth.  No kidding. 
[01:50:30]  He's standing by, though.  Yeah.  All right.  Got to keep it safe.  Got to keep it safe.  That's right.  Her.  Her, her.  Go ahead, sweetie.  Go ahead.  Whenever you're ready.  We're just commenting, guys.  Just stuff your face.  Stand closer to the mic so we can hear you breathing.  Yeah.  Okay.  This is the last one he's already gagging.  Come on.  You all right?  Oh, he's...  Spit him out. 
[01:51:00]  He's just gagging.  Oh.  He's a trooper, though.  He's trying, even though he's turning red.  Seven.  My second guess was right.  He's gagging.  He's gagging at seven.  And he looks angry about this gagging.  He doesn't like it.  Are you all right?  Thumbs up, thumbs down.  All right, we got a thumbs up.  He's continuing.  He can breathe okay?  He can barely breathe.  That's the problem, because he really does need his mouth to breathe.  Have you been to a doctor? 
[01:51:30]  Well, we'll ask you stuff after you spit out all this crap.  He has a seat cushion in his sinuses.  Can we get the mic really close to his face?  All right, he's continuing.  Big A.  The mic is recording on its own.  It's the chubby dummy contest.  Are you chewing?  Where's Pat Duffy?  I want him to eat these.  That's number eight? 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, let's see how brave Pat Duffy really is.  Oh, God.  Imagine that.  All right, what is this?  Number nine going in?  Oh, God.  Steve from Bayshore checking in, saying he'd do better if his tongue didn't weigh 15 pounds.  All right.  What is the paramedic going to do if something goes wrong?  I don't know.  Call for help? 
[01:52:30]  All right.  Is this number...  What are we up to?  This will be number 10.  It's not looking good.  Not looking good.  No.  Bulging out of his mouth.  It's coming out.  He shoves it in the side.  Angrily.  Yeah.  Brr.  That was okay.  What, are you done?  Yeah.  Just spit it in Steve's hand.  Are you done at 10?  Or are you going to try for one more?  I say what?  Oh, he can't.  Oh, the poor boy.  He looks confused.  Ah.  There you go. 
[01:53:00]  Big A with 10 in the chubby dummy contest.  His body doesn't know what to do.  He's never spit food out before.  His body's going, what the hell are you doing?  I need that.  How are the marshmallows?  I think you went 10, right?  Yeah.  10.  All right.  That's not bad, Big A.  Stinks.  E-Rock did better.  Yeah.  That's a small kid.  Hey, Big A.  So when was the last time you've been to a doctor?  That breathing thing's a little scary.  You need your mouth to breathe.  It's obvious.  We worry about you, kid.  I've been to a doctor about a year or two ago. 
[01:53:30]  And he was happy with the results?  Well, a vet.  Huh?  Yes.  Yeah?  Yes.  All right.  All right.  There you go.  Big A in the chubby bun.  We miss you, Andrew.  Thank you.  All right.  Can we step aside and then do some...  Well, actually, we might have time just to get...  It's a bit unsettling, by the way, when we go over to XM after this and we're leaving  XM and sometimes you'll see Andrew, Big A, over there standing in front of his car 
[01:54:00]  and you're always like, hi, and internally you're like, this is the day he kills me.  Yeah.  He's here to hide my face and kill me.  All right.  We're going to do a quickie before we have to get ready for...  Not...  I was going to say before we have to get ready for Kenny, but no, we're looking forward  to Kenny doing...  Eagerly.  I was going to say before we have to take a break, but you really don't want to say that.  All right.  Here we go.  So a kid gets arrested for opening Christmas presents early.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  In this house, under the tree, there was a present waiting for a 12-year-old Rock Hill  boy. 
[01:54:30]  His mother and his grandmother told him not to open it before Christmas.  He didn't listen, and when they found the unwrapped Nintendo Game Boy in his room, they called  the police and had him arrested.  You're kidding.  Come on.  This is a real story.  Yes.  Wow.  Yes.  Were they trying one of those teach him a lesson things?  That's great.  I hope the kid really got convicted, and they sentenced him to some real time.  Oh.  Like if he got like nine months in jail. 
[01:55:00]  Just gets ravaged in prison.  You put him in an adult jail.  How's that?  Six.  How's that every person that has celebrated Christmas, you know, found their gifts?  You got to be smart about it, though.  You do the very slow unwrap.  Yeah.  You play with it.  Oh, you actually would play with the gift?  Yeah, yeah.  I would play with it, and then I'd put it all back in the box before my mom got home, rewrap  it, and put it where it was.  Wow.  Yeah.  I would just take a peek and go, all right.  No, I'd play with it.  You would actually play with it? 
[01:55:30]  I'd freak out.  I'd be like, I got to play with this toy.  I'm a maniac.  Really?  Yeah.  I think that's unusual.  I think most people take a peek, and then they just get really even more excited, like,  all right, cool.  They got that.  And I had to completely unwrap it.  It was very difficult, making sure you didn't tear the paper in any way, and then wrap it  up exactly like it was, put it right back exactly like it was.  I would look and see how it was positioned beforehand, you know, so I could put it back  exactly how it was.  Yeah.  See, I would always switch gifts just to get my parents going. 
[01:56:00]  Like, if they got me a record, I would change it and put a bag of tampons in it and wrap  it in the same paper with my name on it.  How funny would that be?  And they'd be like, who the hell wrapped it?  I love a gift.  And you go, let me look at that.  Well, it's my writing on the wrapping paper.  I'm a little confused.  What's that?  I'd have been drunk that night.  Right.  Or I would switch my parents' gifts with each other.  Like, my mother got my father something.  I believe it was a totes umbrella.  So I went to the adult store and was like, give me the black one. 
[01:56:30]  And then I just wrapped it up like the old totes umbrella.  And he's still using it today.  He certainly is, as an umbrella.  He's not bright.  My sister once saw me and my brother looking for Christmas presents, and we found it.  And she was going to rat us out.  She was like, I'm telling.  So we said, Dawn, why don't you say some curse words?  She goes, no, I'm not allowed.  She goes, no, no, you're allowed.  You're totally allowed.  And we talked her into saying curse words and then said, all right, if you tell that we saw it, we're going to tell that you cursed. 
[01:57:00]  We made her curse so we could use it against her.  What a family of rats.  Oh, totally.  Mobbed up his kids.  Yeah, you tortured your poor sister.  Poor Dawn.  I'm a machine to believe that.  I know.  What a dope.  And this is when they were 19.  We got more on the story here.  Kid gets arrested for opening Christmas present early.  You want to see what my sister threatened to tell?  Uh-oh.  I can only imagine.  He's always been like that. 
[01:57:30]  Anxious to get what he wants, get attention.  And if he can't get his way, he'll find his way.  Reggie Meeks is the boy's cousin.  He admits the boy does have a behavior problem, but was surprised the police were involved.  And I was just kind of, you know, shocked to see it happen like that.  Police say this wasn't the first time the boy had disobeyed his mother.  It doesn't happen in an Asian community.  This is very racist because the man they're describing is 35.  And I don't like the way she's used that terminology. 
[01:58:00]  She needs a booklet.  Yeah, she certainly does.  Mail her that pamphlet.  I was shocked to see it happen like that.  Police say this wasn't the first time the boy had disobeyed his mother.  He acts out in school.  He's shopless.  And last month, police say he was arrested for punching an officer.  And he's 12.  He's 12.  It's over, Johnny.  Let's play the booklet game.  Yeah.  What color is this fella?  Or what ethnic origin or what race? 
[01:58:30]  Wow, this is a toughie.  I've got to tell you.  I have no idea.  I can't tell by the voice.  I'll say a ****.  I'll concur.  Right?  And finally this.  Police charge the boy with petty larceny.  He was never held in jail, but he does have a court appearance scheduled.  His mom says at that appearance, she wants to turn him over to the state.  He's been charged.  Wait, he's been charged with petty larceny for opening up his Christmas gift.  He's obviously a bad kid. 
[01:59:00]  I think it's not a gift until it's given.  He's a bad kid.  He's a bad kid, but you have to use, like, the holiday to set an example and maybe get  this kid some help.  How about your fist?  Just punch him.  You know, Than, you might want to cut the kid a break, but you don't have to hold up  a sign that says, you know.  Absolutely.  And who knows what kind of dancing he enjoys.  That's just racist.  You are.  Read that booklet.  Than's a racist.  If it's not white, it ain't right.  That's what Than says.  I would suggest a kid gets into sports, but, you know, that might not be the right thing 
[01:59:30]  to say.  Absolutely.  God forbid you suggest something positive that the kid could do in his life.  He may be good at math.  Right.  Come on.  Let's be honest here.  I'm trying to have an open mind, but Jesus.  Are you kidding me?  I heard it.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The 2006 Eggnog Challenge will replay on Friday, December 22nd, the day after Opie and  Anthony's appearance on The Tonight Show. 
[02:00:00]  For a video of the 2006 Eggnog Challenge, including the infamous Pat from Munak,  Mickey's Baby Bird video, go to opieandanthony.com or foundrymusic.com.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:00:30]  I haven't taken a lot of phone calls today.  Let's squeeze one in from Chicago.  Jim, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to tell you guys, God bless you for coming on the radio here.  We've had to deal with just so much misery.  We had Howard and the man caught one, and then we had Rover, and now we have this show  on Q101 that, if I could, I'd like to request a pest just to start bombarding Q101 in Chicago.  So it's the most smug, awful humor.  And I just wanted to say, God bless you guys for being on the radio. 
[02:01:00]  Hey, Jim, could you remind us tomorrow?  What's that?  Call in tomorrow and remind us.  I want to get into the Q101 thing in Chicago.  Oh.  I want to know what that's all about, but we're kind of running out of time today.  Okay.  I'll be gone, so I hope it works out.  Yeah, it will absolutely work out.  Someone from Chicago, if Jim doesn't call, call in and tell us what Q101 is all about.  Oh, that's right.  I've heard over the years that it's just hacky, awful radio.  It's the worst bitch you've ever heard.  They're just smug, awful people. 
[02:01:30]  I hate them.  All right, cool.  We'll do that tomorrow, all right, bro?  Yeah.  Hey, thanks, man.  Bye.  And a big hi to everyone listening to us on WCKG in Chicago.  Chicago.  We got Club Soda Kenny in studio.  Hello.  From time to time, we'd like Kenny to come in here and give us the news.  Right.  With his own special twist because, you know, he just loves telling bad news.  Bad news.  He loves informing people of tragedy, just things, you know, anything bad, from the weather to 
[02:02:00]  the most heinous incident.  Yeah, and we all noticed.  And he loves it.  We all noticed, and then finally Jimmy brought it up on the air like, you know, we got to  talk about this because it's always something like, look, I don't want to be a bother.  I don't really want to tell you this, but.  But, and he's kind of a, I told you.  And like Jimmy has said in the past, like, he can't wait to tell you the bad news.  Yeah.  But he makes believe he's just trying to do the right thing.  And that's why I love Kenny. 
[02:02:30]  Yes, Jimmy.  The other night when you guys were out at that awful manager's meeting, my girl and  I went out to eat at a restaurant.  Ooh.  And Kenny, we called, and we were, we were, we was like a mile walk to the restaurant.  So we had walked there, we were going to get a car back.  And I'm like, Kenny, well, the car the guys are using, I forget you guys were in an SUV.  I didn't know you were in a limo.  I'm like, what would it cost me for an extra hour to keep that van?  I'm like, just tell me.  I'll have it come get me so we don't have to walk it a mile back after we eat.  And he's like, I'll, I'll come, I'll come.  I'm like, you don't have to come, man.  It's just, just send it over.  Whatever it is, just tell me.  I'll pay for it.  What is it, an extra 50 bucks? 
[02:03:00]  I don't know.  But it's like, she had on heels.  We didn't want to walk a mile.  Right.  So I'm like, we just sat down to eat.  You know, tell them to be about 45 minutes.  Five minutes later, Kenny runs in and sits down and goes, hi, I just wanted to talk a little business.  And I go, no problem, man.  We never mind.  And my girl goes, well, why don't you, why don't you join us?  I'm like, yeah, why don't you have something to eat, man?  We don't even get our, he goes, no, I don't, I don't want to be a bother. 
[02:03:30]  I don't want to intrude.  Hey, he's on a date.  I don't want to impose.  By the way, though, he tells you that as he's pulling the chair out to get ready to sit down.  Not only did he want to impose, but he told the driver to step on it so he could impose.  Yeah, he couldn't wait.  Step on it.  But I will say.  There's too much fun going on at that restaurant.  I got to get there immediately.  It was the worst attempt at a motivational cover-up I've ever seen.  I don't want to impose, but I'm a little hungry. 
[02:04:00]  I'm going to go back and order room service.  We wanted him to stay.  It wasn't to be polite.  We wanted Kenny to stay because we love his company.  My girl loves him, so.  Jason from Toronto is calling you the ghoul of gloom.  Good for him.  You ready for some news there, Kenny?  Yes, sir.  All right, hold on.  We got an intro and everything.  Let me play this because Steve spent at least three minutes on this.  And now, maybe you should sit down with Club Soda Kenny. 
[02:04:30]  That's right, people.  Sit down and take a couple deep breaths because it's me, Club Soda Kenny, with today's bad news.  Do you like Mexican food?  Yeah, I like Mexican food.  Well, if you ate at Taco Bell in the past month, chances are you're going to die.  Is that serious?  I don't know about that.  You might have a little explosive you-know-what for a while.  Well, and I bet you it won't be a pleasant death either because you're probably going to die on a toilet. 
[02:05:00]  Because over 18 people in the New York area have tested positive for the E. coli virus.  18 people out of 15 million?  How many are here?  That's a lot of people.  That's close enough.  Population in New York, Dan?  I was going to go with 12.  I don't know.  Alderaan, he says.  Yeah.  But they got contaminated onions from Taco Bell.  Sounds more like Taco Hell to me. 
[02:05:30]  And you know what?  Ah.  Apparently nobody at NASA knows what they're doing either.  What?  Really?  Yeah, because, you know, several technical, between, like, several technical problems and  bad weather in the forecast, Thursday's night shuttle lunch is in serious doubt.  Really?  Yeah, the shuttle lunch is in doubt? 
[02:06:00]  The shuttle's, the shuttle's lunch is in doubt, huh?  Horses' ash?  And the launch, too.  Oh, and the launch.  Yeah, I don't think the shuttle's going to take off.  Yeah, or eat.  I hate when Thursday's night shuttle lunch is no good.  God almighty, do you need glasses?  Yeah, get your glasses on.  I don't want to impose.  He was talking to a salt shaker.  Now, this is number 14 font.  I'm good.  All right, good.  But, you know, speaking of the shuttle launch, at this rate, they'll be lucky if they launch 
[02:06:30]  a shuttle at any time this year.  You'd think somebody in the space program would know how to read a weather map.  Well, you would think.  You would think.  There's delays with the space shuttle mission, yes.  Yeah.  You know, they haven't updated that space shuttle in quite a long time.  Yeah, same thing.  Same thing.  Maybe some flat screens they threw in the old cockpit area.  Yeah.  A little modern electronics, maybe.  They might have got rid of some of that clunky equipment and replaced it with flat screens. 
[02:07:00]  It's something new.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think Star Wars-y.  That's what I'm saying.  Wait, did you actually say that, or did Aunt and I just say that?  Well, that's what I mean.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  And, you know, it's the holiday season.  It's supposed to be happy and joyous.  Right.  And it is.  Sure.  Yeah.  It's a great time of year.  It is.  I'm happy.  How are you going to, you know, bum us out as far as Christmas goes?  Well, you know, I don't want to get you down in the dumps, but if you were hoping to buy 
[02:07:30]  all your presents, you know, according to that song, the 12 days of Christmas, the cost  of the items are up more than 3% from last year.  And buying one of everything will cost you almost $19,000.  But who the hell is going to buy that crap for their loved one?  No one.  Somebody did.  They made a song about it.  It's all about birds.  That's all.  Buying one of everything?  Yeah.  Or like buying one and then the two and then three.  Yeah.  Like five golden rings. 
[02:08:00]  You're buying one of each of the five.  So it would be five items.  Right?  That's right.  Is this everything?  That's also what I meant to say.  Everything in the song?  Yeah.  Because it says, and buying one of everything will cost you almost $19,000.  So that's like, how does it start?  What's the first thing?  Shula brought for me a partridge.  Oh, so a partridge in a pear tree.  Right, one of that.  And then the second day is what?  The tree is expensive because there's shipping involved.  Right.  You have to keep the bird in it.  Yeah. 
[02:08:30]  Pear tree, so there's probably some type of a cage.  Heavy fruit hanging off the tree.  You know what a partridge does for these days?  Yeah, it's very expensive.  But not as expensive as two turtle doves.  Right.  Right.  So now is it just one turtle dove?  Because you said one of everything.  No, he's stupid.  He probably thought it was turtle soup.  He bought a tree and two turtle soups.  Kenny, who buys a partridge in a pear tree?  Yeah.  The guy who wrote the song.  Has anyone ever bought a partridge in a pear tree for their love? 
[02:09:00]  I didn't even buy that.  Where would you buy that?  Where would they sell it?  On eBay.  All right.  What is number three, by the way?  Three what?  Three...  What, fam?  What?  French hens.  Oh, yeah.  Three French...  More birds.  Stupid birds.  Who is this guy?  The bird food.  I don't know.  Mmm.  Da.  Ja.  Chicken.  Ja.  Das gut.  All right.  Continue with your buying one of everything will cost you almost $19,000. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  And that's not even taking into account the declining dollar.  You know, so consider yourself forewarned, people.  And since it looks like we're running out of time, I'm going to cut it short.  Yeah.  So that's all the news for today.  But let me end with this.  Enjoy today's slightly milder weather because tomorrow it's going to be freezing in New York.  And can I commend Kenny on the excellent way he read everything on the paper, then looked  at the clock and said, let me stop this because we're running out of time. 
[02:10:00]  We're running out of time.  As if there was a bevy of humorous items to get to, and an executive decision had to be  made.  He read everything on this page, and right now he would have said we're running out of  time if it was 7.40.  We've run out of the printed words.  Oh, boy.  Well, I could have improv'd a little.  Well, like last week I had some news, but I got bumped.  Oh.  Like the guy that got bit by the killer whale.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, why do you think they call them killer whales? 
[02:10:30]  Wow, it's unfortunate that we're running out of time.  There is such a reason you got bumped before you told that.  I'll tell you why they call them killer whales, because they don't write jokes like that.  That was a bomb whale.  It certainly was.  Thank you.  All right.  Ah, wow.  It's time for a MacBook karaoke.  Let's not forget about this, people.  Of course.  Go to www.923freefm.com for all the details. 
[02:11:00]  That's 923freefm.com.  You can win the new MacBook, sleek and sexy, and has everything you need to explore all your  creative possibilities.  Head to the Apple Store or apple.com to check it out.  What?  Nothing.  I just threw something at Erock and then tried to make it look like I didn't.  I was trying to blame Jimmy.  I like the Uncle Paul audio that that kid sent in, by the way.  The what?  The Uncle Paul audio that kid sent in.  Oh, yeah.  Did you see the video yet?  Yeah.  Yeah, pretty funny.  You're sitting on the couch with some young girl.  Some young girl. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  Go to www.opiananthony.com.  They took Jimmy's Uncle Paul character.  They took a bunch of the lines that Jimmy did as Uncle Paul, and they animated it.  And it's on www.opiananthony.com.  It's amazing.  It really is good.  Good job.  Good job.  Coke Logic came up with that.  I'm not going to be here tomorrow.  I've got to go to the doctor.  Oh.  Yeah.  What's wrong, Uncle Paul?  Under my arms, I've got a patch of skin tags.  I've got to have took off by the doctor.  There's a cluster of skin tags under my arms. 
[02:12:00]  A cluster, huh?  Yeah.  It's like a growth cluster.  You're not worried, are you?  You didn't sound very...  No, there's only...  It's like a raised area with about 30 to 40 skin tags.  30 to 40?  Under my arms.  It's like a sea urchin.  You're a mess.  Doctors got to go in and sand them off one by one.  Don't they just snip them?  I don't know.  I don't like that.  Too many.  Too many to snip?  Use your electric razor or something. 
[02:12:30]  Take them off yourself.  A little alcohol.  How's the dating scene, Uncle Paul?  It's very good.  Yeah?  Yeah, very active.  Yeah?  Very active, having get-togethers.  Yeah?  Well, a couple of my friends I saw on TV, they're actors.  Uh-huh.  There's a show called Dateline.  Oh, well.  I don't think they were acting.  They were all in Hollywood stars. 
[02:13:00]  No, that's not acting.  That's a reality show, Uncle Paul.  Well, I had a little problem.  I had to settle out of court.  Yeah?  You want to share the story?  I'll have to think it through first.  I just wanted to say settle.  Settle.  Looks like he could be a swinger.  Yeah.  Is that true?  Probably back in the day.  I was.  Yeah?  Yeah, all kinds of different partners.  Before his wife was burnt.  Yeah.  She got burnt in a fire for insurance money. 
[02:13:30]  And, uh, she was also starting to interfere.  Oh.  The way I raised my daughter.  Oh, my God.  She was saying I shouldn't be giving her baths no more.  I suppose to.  Maybe you shouldn't.  I suppose to let the kid be dirty.  I've got to keep it clean down there.  Keep it nice and shiny.  All right.  You're despicable.  Well, have fun at the doctor tomorrow, Uncle Paul.  Yeah.  And the skin tags and all that. 
[02:14:00]  Hey, I'm on Pal Talk.  I'm doing that thing at 4 p.m. Eastern time.  Oh, yeah.  Pal Talk.  Celebrity Pal Talk thing.  Yeah, it's like a little interview kind of fun thing.

And then it's in the Pal Talk 9.0 Free Talk Room.  And, yeah, you get in there.  You don't even have to, you kind of just go to their website.  You don't have to pay for it that day.  It's just kind of a free little, you know, jump in.  And I will be broadcasting live from the great room of my house. 
[02:14:30]  So you'll be able to, you know, I'm setting up, trying to set up a fireside chat type atmosphere.  Just like the president.  I like it.  Just like the president.  I like it.  That's a 4 o'clock p.m.  Please wear something ridiculous.  A periwinkle shirt.  Huh?  Or a periwinkle shirt.  Yeah.  Or a staff jacket.  How about a bonnet?  Wear a bonnet.  A Hitler jacket and a bonnet.  But never acknowledge that.  Mix and match.  Just talk like regular. 
[02:15:00]  All right.  The music's getting louder.  That means we've got to get out of here.  If you're not joining us over at XM, have a great day.  And, Jimmy, we'll see you on Monday.  See you on Monday.  Yeah.  All right.  Patrice O'Neill in tomorrow sitting in for Jimmy.  And thanks, guys.  We appreciate it.  Spread the word, will you?  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  It's the 2006 homeless shopping spree, only on the O.P. & Anthony Show. 
[02:15:30]  Coming soon to a snooty mall.  Maybe one near you.  The O.P. & Anthony Show will bring a busload of homeless degenerates shopping for Christmas presents.  And you, of course, are invited to watch and shop along.  Golden Buns is going to get busy.  Immerse yourself in a time-honored tradition.  Enjoy the holiday spirit and the stench of booze and vomit as we partake in another homeless shopping spree on the O.P. & Anthony Show. 
[02:16:00]  Bye.  It's the O.P. & Anthony Show.  The O.P. & Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Let's march.  Music's too loud every day.  Turn that goddamn thing down, Phil.  Thank you.  Howdy, Bill.  On the streets of New York.  Looking for stereotypes today.  Oh, is that what we're doing?  There's one.  There's one.  There's one.  There's one. 
[02:16:30]  There's one.  There's one.  There's one.  There's one.  But they all have their iPods on.  Yeah, they don't want to talk.  I'm sure Eric Logan doesn't want to hear that today as he does the walk with us today.  But the reality is there's a lot of people with their iPod buds on.  How do you know their iPods?  Huh?  How do you know their iPods?  White.  Not some portable.  No, it's the white.  You can plug those in.  Sure.  Plug them into your phone.  Get a little XM on your phone.  Yeah.  Hey, Andrew.  All right.  Let's remind Andrew.  Homeless shopping spree. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, we got to keep reminding him.  A week from Saturday.  A week from Saturday.  The homeless shopping spree.  Are you hearing me?  Are you getting psyched?  I'll be here on 16th.  On the 16th.  Yeah, he knows.  Okay.  That's a Saturday, right?  Yeah.  A Saturday.  Big shopping spree.  All right.  Write yourself a note.  Have you read the paper yet today?  I haven't read the paper yet.  All right.  When are you going to read it?  I'm going to say they call it squirting monkeys.  I read the headline in the New York Post. 
[02:17:30]  Oh.  We didn't get into this yet on the show yet.  Surrender.  Surrender monkeys.  Surrender monkeys.  What does that mean?  It's on the front page of the New York Post.  That means they want to get out of the James Baker.  They had a special commission to study the situation in Iraq.  Yeah.  So they want them to pull all the troops from Iraq.  Right, right.  He does better news than Kenny.  No kidding.  That's what they call them.  Surrender monkeys.  So what do you think of that?  I think, no, we got to stay there.  Once you make a determination in life, you got to do something. 
[02:18:00]  You got to achieve the goal.  Absolutely.  Like when you say you're going to ruin your life and have nothing going on,  God damn it, you got to do it.  That's right.  I have to.  Absolutely.  If I don't do it, who's going to do it for me?  Oh, I have to do it.  Wow.  Oh, Elo threw down a 10.  Elo threw you a 10 today, brother.  He don't part with money very easily.  No, he certainly doesn't.  So take that as a compliment.  Wow.  So the thing is, maybe Andrew could be my fucking agent.  And you do something.  Give him an XM radio without a subscription.  Maybe.  He could listen to that channel that just repeats over and over again, 
[02:18:30]  your serial number to the radio.  I just got a big bill from XM, too.  A $200 and something dollar bill.  For what?  I don't know.  They just billed me for something.  For what?  For Elo's radios.  What's that?  Jimmy got a bill.  We're getting paid for the boss's radios.  I don't know what it is.  Yeah, we need some more ARPU, some more revenue.  So I'm just going to start billing.  Yeah.  Okay.  Random.  I'm going to bill this guy down here.  That's why I gave him a 10.  I don't know what it was.  Is it for your radios?  Maybe.  I can fix that.  That's how we got the sub count up now.  Employees, free radios, too.  Our competitor counts cars on parking lots. 
[02:19:00]  We'll just start charging our employees.  That's right.  Hey, what's the deal with Howard and a free keychain you sent me yesterday?  We didn't get to it on the air.  Their new promotion to drive subs is if you sign up, you get a free Howard keychain.  Now, I don't understand why you're giving this information out.  The competition now is going to take over with that kind of image.  Well, I have to figure, one of our meetings today, we're going to figure out, are we going  to do, like, free T-shirts, maybe?  Right, right.  Yeah.  How about this?  If you buy a subscription, you get a Bob Edwards coffin.  Hey, Elo, show everyone the phone, too. 
[02:19:30]  I know this is radio, but maybe you can explain it.  How cool is this?  I was really impressed.  I got this dumb pebble, but I want to upgrade to that phone.  Yeah, so I'll turn it on.  This is the new singular phone.  Also, the new Blackjack does this.  Wait, there is a Blackjack out there?  Someone mentioned Blackjack yesterday.  Yeah, I saw a Blackjack at the airport yesterday, actually.  What is a Blackjack?  It's the new Sam song.  A guy named Jack that doesn't work.  I thought this person...  I said racially initiative.  Hey, I didn't get the booklet on this side.  I thought this person was uninformed, and they meant to say Blackberry, but there really  is a Blackjack.  No, it's called a Blackjack. 
[02:20:00]  I'd never heard of it.  It's the competitor to the Q. Singular has it, and you can get XM Radio Mobile on it,  and it has all the channels streamed on your cell phone.  Okay.  And we have Singular, and we also have Alltel, and we've got another big provider coming on  here pretty soon as well.  Going to be moving into Poland.  That's a takeover.  That's a sleek black flip phone.  It's a smartphone with Windows Mobile.  But this is a question, because when I'm on the subways, a lot of the youths are listening  to music on their cell phones right now. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, that's one of the reasons why we did that.  This is the question I have.  If you plug in some buds, how's the quality?  I got the buds with me.  I'll plug in.  Is it good quality?  Yeah, it's good quality.  I know you've got to sell the company line, but the reality is, does it sound pretty good?  Is it listening to an MP3?  No.  Is it like listening to it over the internet?  But it's good enough, and...  It's your phone.  I mean, it's amazing.  Yeah, okay.  So, look, here you go.  As it comes up here, and you hit Done, and it just rolls like this, and it'll load as we  keep walking.  All of a sudden, you'll be able to listen to it.  And here's the question.  How do we get 202 on the singular phones? 
[02:21:00]  That's what we're working on.  Isn't that his guy?  There's got to be a way.  They're just doing music right now.  Isn't that great?  Standing on the sidewalk, looking at this expensive piece of electronics as a man in his own piss  is trying to figure out what he's going to eat in a minute.  Yeah, but he's got 10 bucks.  But we're all more interested in this, and our asses are in the guy's face.  Yeah, yeah.  We just don't care.  Show him that.  Homeless guy.  Look.  Look what you'll never have.  Look at that.  Jesus.  Look what you'll never have.  I can't even see that.  Yeah, you can't comprehend it or anything.  Watch out. 
[02:21:30]  Watch out.  There's it.  I earned that.  What do you think?  He's playing it for Andrew, the homeless guy.  What do you think, Andrew?  It's beautiful.  It's beautiful?  It's beautiful, yeah.  Wow.  Maybe during the homeless shopping spree, you can pick up something for yourself.  I like that.  A cell phone.  You know what?  You guys are going to help me to get my glasses.  You're going to get glasses?  We've got to take him to one of those glasses places in the mall and get him some glasses.  I don't need the money.  I just need the glasses. 
[02:22:00]  Well, just use some of the money and stop drinking and get yourself a pair of glasses.  I'm not feeling sorry for you because you don't have glasses.  Maybe one.  You just made another, like, who knows?  By the time we leave, you're going to make another 50 bucks from us.  Get yourself some fucking glasses.  He lives, too.  His lower teeth are awful.  When you leave, I leave, too.  The guy with a cat will come here.  Opie, we will take him to the lens place.  We'll take him to a glasses place in the mall, and they'll hook him up with glasses.  All right.  During the homeless shopping spree, you should have got glasses before now.  And you should have got dental floss before now. 
[02:22:30]  Well, that's what happens.  When you leave, I leave, too.  Believe me.  You live on the street.  10 minutes, 15 minutes.  Don't worry.  Homeless shopping spree, my friend.  That's going to be a treat for you.  Yeah.  We'll get you glasses so you can see the awful circumstances you've gotten yourself into.  Thank you.  You're going to break them the second you look around.  Oh, by the way, instead of reading the paper, he's sitting on it for a cushion.  And then later they become clothing.  Somebody stole my bag.  Oh, they stole your bag?  Yeah.  I got another bag.  You know, did they hit you and take it?  No. 
[02:23:00]  I was sleeping on the train of school, and somebody just took my bag.  I didn't even know that.  There's no honor between you homeless people.  How about no honor?  This is the life you have to go through, you know.  No chivalry.  Got Bill Burr said it all.  People steal your bag, step on your cake, a bunch of scumbags.  I didn't have all my clothes to a guard.  Bob Denver.  So I had to go restart again.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Well, we'll see you on the 16th.  Homeless shopping spree, a week from Saturday.  We'll take you to get your glasses.  God bless y'all.  Have a good one.  There goes Andrew. 
[02:23:30]  Well, here we go.  He stays there.  Exactly.  Doesn't move.  God forbid he looks for a job.  Hey, where's Shiloh?  What is this?  Excuse me.  Sponsoring the walkover.  Someone is sponsoring the walkover?  What is it?  Oh.  She was an Asian woman.  Today's walkover?  Steve's got to, like, do a quick plug here.  Oh, and the today's walkover brought to you by Honey.  Go ahead, Steve.  Today's walkover is being sponsored by Natrol.  We're actually giving out bottles of it.  It's an energy drink.  Energy drink?  It's an energy drink.  Energy drink.  Why don't you save yourself some money and get Faggot Gloves to sponsor this walkover? 
[02:24:00]  Well, it's interesting you should mention that because after we get done handing out Natrol,  we're going to hand out Faggot Gloves.  Those are great.  Is there a cock to grab?  Are you tired of the helmet falling between your fingers?  These are the gloves for you.  Can I finish this plug, Jimmy?  I can't even look at it.  I'm trying to have Natrol.  Get the Natrol.  Natrol.  It boosts energy.  It has zero calories, zero fat, and zero sugar.  And it's available in strawberry and orange flavors. 
[02:24:30]  That's sweet.  So is AIDS.  Sounds good.  He just described AIDS as well.  It's a little chilly today.  Which way are we going?  Oh, we've got to go across this way.  Because then we don't have to do the other thing.  Yeah, the other thing with the thing.  All right.  Let's do this thing.  Sir, I learned that you don't know martial arts today.  That's right.  Yes.  We learned that.  You're not a good athlete.  Sir, I learned you don't like beans necessarily. 
[02:25:00]  I learned that today.  That's what the booklet said.  That's right.  Sir, I learned that you're not actually good at sports.  Right.  How do you like them apples?  And you don't have a mullet.  Miss.  All right.  That was handy.  Sir, with the pink boa,  I learned that you might not be gay.  Or a hairdresser.  Or a hairdresser.  Oh.  Oh. 
[02:25:30]  It's too cold to comment on anything.  It's not that bad today.  Ah, yes it is.  I hate the winter.  What's up, sir?  What's that?  Jimmy, holiday cheer?  Oh, thank you, man.  What is it?  Something good?  Yeah.  Starbucks?  Oh, what happened?  I don't accept that.  Kenny?  Kenny, could you accept that?  Yeah, you know, a little holiday cheer.  Hold that for me.  Would you get a ticket?  I'll take it for seeing you guys, too.  You got a how much?  $115 for sitting right here.  $115 ticket to see us.  While you were sitting there?  It's worth it, sir.  It's worth it.  We're big stars.  I was waiting online for Starbucks. 
[02:26:00]  Army.  That sucks.  That's what you get for calling me names on the radio.  Thanks, man.  Very much.  Get that taken care of.  How much is the card worth, do you think?  I would say $20.  How much are these?  How much?  $30, $40, something like that.  Wow.  $30 or $40, something like that.  Thank you.  I mean, it's $15, but I'm very appreciative.  I love my coffee.  Thank you, sir.  What did I miss?  Army guy?  Morning jog.  U.S. Army.  What's this?  Black Sabbath?  Are you for real? 
[02:26:30]  You just jogging in place?  I'm jogging in place.  I'm jogging all around.  He's jogging all around.  How far do you go?  About three miles.  How long have you been in the Army?  About 30, almost 31 years.  What rank?  Sergeant first class.  How many push-ups can you do?  Right now, about 45.  Good drill sergeant push-ups.  Wow.  What are drill sergeant push-ups?  Correct.  Go all the way down, coming all the way up.  Not, you know, halfway.  Shoulders up, all the way down. 
[02:27:00]  Give me one.  What are you, a recruiter?  He could do 45 of these.  Let me see.  Ready?  All right, hold on, hold on.  I'll do them with you.  All right.  Oh, look at them.  Oh, a couple of men.  All right.  This is going to get hot.  What are we going for?  Can you do it on top of Opie?  Yeah.  45?  Can you do it on top of Opie?  Oh, boy.  I mean, correct.  I mean, you got to follow.  All right, I'm showing.  Ready?  Go.  Go. 
[02:27:30]  Wow, look at this Army guy go.  The Army guy's looking straight ahead, too.  Yeah.  No, he's not.  I was looking at the guy.  Opie's legs are wide open.  Opie's legs are wide open.  I'm in there still, God damn it.  Let's go.  U.S. Army Airborne push-up.  Let's go, motherfucker.  Wow.  Send me back to Iraq.  I'm here.  Let's go.  Wow.  Opie, your legs are too wide.  Holy shit. 
[02:28:00]  Opie can do some push-ups.  He sure can.  What the fuck's up with that?  Wow.  Wow.  All the way up.  All the way up.  All the way up.  Opie must be.  Wow.  All the way up.  Yeah, you got it.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Opie can do some push-ups.  Opie just had a stroke. 
[02:28:30]  Not bad.  Wow.  Yeah, Opie's done for the day.  Yeah.  That's it.  Tell him that I'm 53.  Thank you.  We'll see you tomorrow.  This guy's 53.  I'm 53 also, right?  Yeah, he's 53.  You're two years away from each other.  Opie's just got out of college.  Yeah.  I just got out of college, so it wasn't fair.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Kerry was in college also.  He got sent to Vietnam.  What are you, 82nd?  What's up, brother?  Well, I was attached to the 82nd down to Ramadi in Iraq.  Wow.  You want to count?  Okay, you going to run with me now? 
[02:29:00]  I'll run with you.  Let's do it.  Slow jog.  Bye, guys.  Jesus.  How many push-ups did he do?  Wow.  Very impressive.  He must be a good leg.  Did he stop?  Well, now he's ready to jog.  But did he stop?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, you beat him.  Yeah.  You totally got him.  Oh, cadence, too.  Wait, excuse me.  I don't understand.  But, boy, you do a lot of push-ups.  Yeah.  By the way, I dare someone to play the La La game today.  Why?  Oh, right.  We always play the La La game. 
[02:29:30]  Okay.  Not today.  There is somebody that would have been written up in the pamphlet that is known to probably  shoot you if you do it.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to pass out.  Can we go upstairs?  Wow.  Go upstairs.  Yeah, you poured it on there, O.  The Army guy's also in great shape.  Not even winded.  Yeah.  I can run right now.  I can run another five miles right now.  Hello, miss.  All right.  How are you?  Good.  Good job, brother.  She doesn't want to be on mic.  She's a shy girl. 
[02:30:00]  Thanks for what you do.  Smoking.  Take care, man.  Army guy's leaving us.  Thank you.  Oh, wow.  That was good.  Very impressive, O.  I told you that body doesn't come from nothing.  That was impressive.  Go on to my Islander tickets, by the way.  Oh, boy.  We'll figure it out upstairs.  Look how good they're doing this year.  No one wants to go.  Dude, they were in first place until yesterday.  Were they?  And now the Devils are in first place by a point.  They're doing really well this year.  Martin broke really well.  I've been keeping tabs.  See, a Devil kicked the Rangers' ass. 
[02:30:30]  Did they?  All right.  We'll see some of you guys upstairs.  Thank you.  That was cool.  All right.  Wow.  We'll see you upstairs.  Opium Revenue.  XM-202.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps.  Ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow.  How long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right.  Here we go. 
[02:31:00]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  And we're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of talent all PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead. 
[02:31:30]  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[02:32:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:32:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:33:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:33:30]  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back. 
[02:34:00]  And there's 30 people waiting for three of the slowest elevators ever.  Oof.  Thanks.  Ancient steam lift.  See you guys in a few.  Oh, no. 
[02:34:30]  All right.  Well, at least we start big.  Sorry for that long delay.  But Jimmy is going to take a remote mic into the bathroom with him.  And you know how fun this is.  I'll be honest with you.  This is probably going to be a solid one.  Is that a hot?  Is that okay?  I think it's coming through the mic that's still on in the studio.  Now it's on.  No, I can't hear it.  I can't hear it.  Well, give it a try.  All right.  Hi, Mom.  Give it a try.  Use muscles to try to make sound.  Something tells me that this is going to be a loud.  Like a big splash, that's it? 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, like a good splash.  What we like to call the Lacey Peterson.  By the way, I also want my official count.  Get Sam and his camera to count them out.  I got my camera.  I'm from New York.  I got my camera.  I'm going to see how many push-ups Opie did.  You want me to eat?  Yeah, I'm starving.  How many did he do?  I taped it on my camera.  Apparently one of these has been used already recently.  I've been up in there.  All right.  Yeah, it looked like dinting more beef stew. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, it looked like an Oompa Loompa was holding on for dear life,  and his finger skin came off in the bowl.  That's terrific.  It's disgusting.  I know.  Tell us when you're ready.  Yeah, I'm just sitting down.  It's probably going to be a quiet one, though.  It feels like...  Oh, you never know.  On the elevator, I was trying to squeeze it out,  but I was afraid if I did,  I was going to break it off and just push it,  and it was going to just cascade down my leg.  You there?  Yeah, we're... 
[02:36:00]  I'm just getting...  I'm not even sitting.  Oh, you're just getting comfortable?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Take it.  I'll take it.  I'll jump in.  All right.  Someone said,  Ricky from Massachusetts,  I didn't know if that was the intro music  or the ambulance coming for Opie.  Since he said...  I think he said...  See, I was feeling him out, Anthony.  Yeah.  Because I was thinking,  all right, I want to maybe take him on.  That's why I asked how many you think he could do.  If he said 70 or 80,  I was like, 
[02:36:30]  oh, well, great.  You know,  because then I would have looked really, really bad.  No, you definitely had him.  Now you're all pumped up.  Starting with the leak.  You know what's coming next.  That's...  I'll give him the old cheek lift so I can look. 
[02:37:00]  I can almost smell it.  Yeah.  All right, that's it for now.  It'll take a second.  I'm going to sit here for a minute and just relax.  All right, that's fine.  Try to make some more duty.  That's all good.  Only on the ONA show can you go from  Opie working out with a soldier  to mic'd up sounds of Jimmy's asshole 
[02:37:30]  spewing into the toilet.  Right.  You've got to love it.  Art from Boston.  What a diverse program.  Man, I didn't hear that, Anthony.  I apologize.  DJ Ana Lightbulb from posthores.net.  You boys plowed through a great ant line  when Opie asked Elo what the blackjack is  and said a guy named Jack who doesn't work.  Oh, yes, yes.  That's okay, though.  But see, the listeners hear it.  Yeah, they hear it.  That's all that counts.  That's a good line.  And then you said they didn't give me  the pamphlet on this side. 
[02:38:00]  Can anyone hear me?  Yeah.  Yeah, we heard you.  Okay.  That was a good line.  I can't hear you.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I'll have to wait until the break, people,  in PalTalk to make some more admins.  Yeah.  Apparently, there's a lot of riffraff in the room today.  Why?  A lot of riffraff.  I don't know.  Just people that want to...  Cause problems?  Cause problems.  You're winning.  You're...  Oh, the official push-up count. 
[02:38:30]  Oh.  Oh.  The army guy had 41.  Opie had 50.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  And his got pretty sloppy towards the end, too.  His did?  Yeah, his were.  He was lifting his head.  He was doing the girl push-ups.  I wouldn't tell him that, though.  Only two dumps today, by the way.  And a third dump on the way from Jimmy.  Yeah.  Well...  What were the dumps?  Surprisingly, they...  What were the dumps?  Surprisingly, they dumped out of ASSEC's at 7... 
[02:39:00]  Oof.  He's pushing.  Nothing happened to him.  You're gonna give yourself a little, like, uh...  A hemorrhoid or something.  Hemorrhoid?  A nickel-sized fucking piece fell out.  Oh, I hate that.  The size of a nickel.  I hate that.  You need someone to push your tummy?  Yeah, what I like to do is have somebody kneel on the ball and grab my lower back and 
[02:39:30]  my stomach and rub them together and go, who's a big boy?  Oh.  Oh, God.  Hey, Jimmy.  I just got word that Uncle Paul's in the stall next to you.  Well, you know what I do.  Hey, Paul.  Hi.  Hi, guys.  I remember one time TJ was having problems making.  So what you gotta do sometimes is you gotta go in there and you gotta loosen the stall up. 
[02:40:00]  And if you apply a little castor oil to your finger, castor oil works nicely.  Old-time remedies.  Yeah, you put some castor oil on your finger.  Uh-huh.  And you put it up there and you loosen it up a little bit.  Helps everybody along, you know.  Helps TJ go to the bathroom nicely.  Thank you, Uncle Paul, for the help.  You're welcome.  Jimmy, you heard that? 
[02:40:30]  Yes.  All right, good.  Yes.  Yes.  It's in the other stall.  All right, should we take a break, Jim?  Oh.  Did I hear a little something there?  That was just the newspaper turning.  Oh, yeah.  He's reading.  Yeah.  He needs to read.  Uncle Paul, you sound bored in the stall there.  I already got this issue.  It's the Nambla Quarterly.  I've got this one ready.  It's got that Wilkins boy on the counter. 
[02:41:00]  Wilkins boy.  I don't like his hair.  He has hair like Adam Rich in Eight is Enough.  Jimmy, back to you.  Apparently the shit is sitting in me sideways.  It's fucking like a T-square.  Jimmy, I just got word that Frank the Frowner is in the stall on the other side.  So you've got Uncle Paul, Jimmy in the middle, and then Frank the Frowner all in the bathroom at the same time.  Well, you know what? 
[02:41:30]  You were informed incorrectly because Frank the Frowner has a really sore throat.  If he were to talk, it would be sorer.  Yeah, wouldn't that suck?  And Frank the Frowner needs his vocal cords for L.A., right?  Not really, no.  It's just for meetings.  All right.  With Uh-Oh.  Uh-Oh.  Uh-Oh.  Uh-Oh.  Shh.  Please, God.  I'm going to take a while.  It's teasing.  It's being seductive.  It really is teasing everybody, Jimmy. 
[02:42:00]  It's being like Lady Luck.  It's hanging around the bung, but it won't just drop out.  Hey, to the end, some feedback, because the guy, you know, over and over again.  So, uh, we say hi to Dwayne Shortage from Kentucky.  You guys are a bunch of faggots.  Opie, you are worthless piece of shit that has no talent.  Ooh.  I dare you to mention this on the air, you goddamn bastard, bastard motherfucker.  Wow.  Dwayne, now what?  Now what happens?  Now what? 
[02:42:30]  Please tell me what happens now.  Now what?  Now what?  Now what?  And he's listening.  Now what?  Now what?  Keep listening.  Now what?  Jimmy, anything?  No, I'm just reading about this Beauty and the Beast.  I now want to go see this play.  I like this guy.  Oh, you like the guy?  He's a go-getter.  He's claiming that she came on to him, by the way.  Hey.  What's that story all about?  It's the Beauty and the Beast guy.  Yeah, the guy that played the Beast.  But he was in another play when this went down.  Yes, he was in some other play.  Jane Eyre. 
[02:43:00]  Jane Eyre.  Whatever the hell that is.  Jane Eyre.  And this mother took her 15-year-old daughter to the show and for some reason let the 15-year-old  daughter go backstage and visit with this guy alone.  And I guess they got to know each other a little bit.  And then it ended up they went out to dinner.  Yeah.  And as they're out to dinner, their legs touched together and she kind of put her hand on his 
[02:43:30]  thigh and started, you know, going up and touching his cock.  Was there cock touching going on?  Yes.  See, they didn't say that in the post.  Well, in the post he said, she touched my, and then it was illegible or something, but  she was touching.  Okay.  And they had met a couple of more times, but eventually they ended up in his hotel.  Or his apartment in Manhattan.  And he asked, what were you thinking when we were out to dinner that night? 
[02:44:00]  And she said, I was thinking how I wanted to have sex with you.  And apparently they started kissing.  And he says, his side of the story is, that he stopped it right then and said, look, this  is wrong.  I'm not doing this.  This could be trouble.  Nothing but trouble.  And stopped the whole thing.  Yeah.  Her side of the story is, they got naked and he fucked her. 
[02:44:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you think?  He got naked, she got naked, and I think they had sex.  There was sex.  Yeah.  You don't go that far and then just go, that's the point where you go, oh, this, yeah, this  is wrong.  Is that your professional opinion, by the way?  Yes.  Professional opinion.  Because we are experts.  I am an expert.  I mean, experts are radio.  Radio.  They've got a microphone in front of me.  So, apparently, this guy has some kind of, had some kind of charges against him in California  that never came to fruition. 
[02:45:00]  Right.  Somehow, some way.  But they want to bring that up in this case.  But, yeah.  You got to think if they were laying in the same bed.  Yeah, they're kissing.  That's kind of the point of no return.  Sure.  She's 15.  You know, I'm going to sound like a pervert here, but there are some 15-year-old girls  that look a lot older.  There are some 15-year-old girls that look, you know, 12.  But there are some 15-year-old girls that look like they're 19.  Sure. 
[02:45:30]  Right.  Sure.  Look who's agreeing with me.  Oh, boy.  Uncle Paul's still in the car.  A shitting Uncle Paul.  Yeah.  Uncle Paul.  And he's the one that wants the 15-year-old that looks like the 12-year-old.  I had a similar situation.  Did you, Uncle Paul?  A lot of times, they come on, you're powerless to stop what nature says you should do.  I was a Santa Claus.  I was playing Santa Claus in the department store.  Santa Claus, yeah.  And this little girl, you know, she was on my lap asking for gifts. 
[02:46:00]  I think she said, I want my grandmama back.  Oh.  And I said, okay, if you come in the room with me, we could talk about bringing grandmama back.  Right.  And?  And was she disappointed when she realized grandmama wasn't coming back?  I didn't ask her.  I just left my job as a Santa Claus. 
[02:46:30]  Santa Claus.  Hey, Anthony, more feedback coming in.  Someone from their cell phone.  Opie, you are the best part of the show.  A true talent.  I dare you to read this on air.  Okay.  There you go.  See?  And this from Matt from Queensbury.  You guys are a hoot.  Opie, you're really funny.  And so is everyone else.  I dare you to mention this on the air.  P.S.  The other guy is gay. 
[02:47:00]  All right.  Bunch of tools.  Were we going to break?  Yeah, I guess so.  We're kind of just stalling here for the grand finale.  Jim?  Will there be a grand finale today?  No, I'm already wiping.  Oh.  Wiping.  How many wipes?  It's going to take a few because it's...  Wait, have you started wiping?  Yeah.  Shit.  I wanted to guess how many wipes.  Yes, that's what he was wiping.  Okay.  Well, guess.  I've only started.  But you know how many you wiped already?  Yes.  All right.  I'm going to go with... 
[02:47:30]  See what happened.  You broke off a piece and there's still some that is just kind of pushing a little bit.  I'm going to go with 10 wipes.  Anthony?  With Jimmy?  Just needs a few because he goes deep.  Okay.  He really goes deep.  I'll give you a count as I'm going.  All right.  You say three.  8.75.  Now I'm on two so far.  And hold on a second.  All right.  I have to...  I open...  I'm grabbing my left cheek with my left hand. 
[02:48:00]  I'm opening.  And I'm taking the paper, placing it on the asshole, and pushing in with my right index  finger.  Oh, God.  Pushing in and pulling out.  And now it's shaped like a little ghost with brown stuff on his head.  Oh.  Oh.  A little brown-hatted ghost.  A brown-hatted ghost?  Okay.  This is number four.  Wait.  Five.  Getting close, though? 
[02:48:30]  Six.  Uh-huh.  I have to shake the head of my cock.  I just dripped a little tinkle on the newspaper.  Uh-huh.  And, uh...  Ooh.  Yeah.  Seven.  Yes.  Running the paper's getting wider and wider.  Eight.  Eight does it.  Eight.  All right.  Eight.  There you go.  Whoever had eight wins.  Terrific.  Let's go to Jeff in New Jersey.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, good morning, boys.  You're not worth it, so...  Hey, uh...  Thank you, sir.  I had called last year about participating or funding the participants in the Homeless 
[02:49:00]  Shopping Spree.  Is that going to be possible?  The fans are going to be able to participate and help raise more funds?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the Homeless Shopping Spree, it's a little different this year.  We're doing it a week from Saturday, so it can be on regular radio as well.  And the reason we're throwing it on regular radio is to get as many people as possible  to listen to the show and what mall we're picking and all that.  And then, of course, you go to that mall and, yeah, help the Homeless Shopping.  You can buy them whatever you want.  That's the beauty of this thing. 
[02:49:30]  I had another idea for the people that aren't close by.  If we set up a PayPal site, a website, with mug shots of the participants, and people all  across the country can help.  I can help with that setting up of that.  Right.  What did he say?  No idea.  I was babbling.  I'm a little nervous.  Now, don't worry.  The Homeless guys will get enough money and gifts.  They're going to be well taken care of a week from Saturday, okay?  You got it. 
[02:50:00]  All right.  Thank you, Jeff.  I appreciate it.  Have a good day, boys.  Yeah, we'll see you at the mall.  Hey, Opie, you just read my email.  Now what?  Now what?  Now what?  Brian from North Carolina.  All right.  And someone just wants to let us know they're rock hard from hearing Jimmy in the bathroom.  So, there you go.  All right.  We're going to take a break, and we'll get into some other things in just a bit here.  We'll get to the cycle drops.  I know I speak like an idiot.  Do you?  It's all about me.  Is it? 
[02:50:30]  I was assaulted.  Were you?  We're brilliant broadcasters.  Are we?  You are out of your mind.  Am I?  Oh, that sounds real good.  Does it?  I'm thrilled.  I'm excited.  Am I?  I thought I heard Negro.  Did you?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Is it?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, by the way, I really wasn't kidding. 
[02:51:00]  I got four really, really, really good tickets to the Islanders game tonight that I cannot  use.  They're my personal tickets.  Where are you going?  I'm just too tired, to be completely honest with you.  I have to go out to Long Island.  I'm still recuperating from the trip.  I know.  And we got a little lunch with Elo, and I don't know. 
[02:51:30]  I just want to mellow out.  It's going to be a good game, too.  Islanders, Canadians.  I got four tickets.  You can sit in my seats.  I'm dead serious.  So if someone's close to the XM Studios, I'd like to give, like, you know, two listeners  a pair each.  That would be the cool thing.  That would be.  But, I mean, I'm looking for, you know, real hockey fans, not someone that's just like,  ah, what the hell.  So come on by.  How about the 200-second caller?  Ooh.  Just if you're in the area, and if you're an Islanders fan, and you're looking  for some sweet seats tonight, come on by, and I'll hand them to you, all right? 
[02:52:00]  I don't want it to go to waste.  I'm sad I can't go to lunch.  I'm missing the lunch, too.  Oh, all right.  I'm not sad.  Yeah.  Because I would miss you.  I would miss you, Jimmy.  I'm going to a, to a, this is funny.  Instead of Los Angeles, I always say, I'm going to La La Land, you know.  La La Land.  I like saying the left coast.  That's another one where people know where you're going, but you sound like you've been there.  One time I said, I'm going to a place where the blacks run in a riot.  Hey, let's get Big A in here. 
[02:52:30]  He'll help us with the top 10 greatest TV quotes and catchphrases chosen by TD Land.  Oh.  Do we have a copy for Big A?  Nope.  No copy for Big A.  Yeah, here, here.  Make another.  What?  Oh, God.  I don't, oh, I don't agree.  No.  Oh, this stinks.  I agree with a couple of them.  Yeah?  There's a few that are switched around.  There's some that aren't even catchphrases. 
[02:53:00]  There's some, I, I, I.  Ah, these lists always stink, but it gives us some fodder to get into some discussions.  That's the reason we do it.  And, uh, we definitely got to do Damon Wayans before we get out of here.  Can we get him on the phone?  We're trying?  Well, that's the type of guest we want for our show.  Have we been trying or no?  Rowan will offer some stupid, like, almost celebrity that is the star of an almost good  TV show.  And then something real happens, like Tracy Morgan get arrested, we can't get him on the  phone, and he's a friend of the show.  And Damon Wayans, we've had him on in the past. 
[02:53:30]  I mean, he's willing to talk today.  Yeah.  He apparently, um.  I asked Rowan, we'll see what happens, I guess.  At the Laugh Factory during, uh.  That's the, that's the.  Chocolate Sunday night.  He got on stage, used the word nigger.  That is banned in that club.  And banned from CBS Radio, too.  Numerous times.  Yeah.  They fined him, uh, for each instance.  And then, uh, banned him, uh, for, uh, from the club for a period of time, I guess.  Stupid, uh, Jamie. 
[02:54:00]  Stupid David Masada.  And it was Black Night.  Black Night, yeah.  They call it Chocolate Sunday.  It's Sunday night.  And it's all black comics.  I hope the, uh, the comics, they should see Jimmy.  Rebel.  Because you guys, you guys do this.  You guys should band together.  You do band together at times for some really good causes when you're, you know, you're getting  stiffed by a club and stuff.  They should all get together and say, look, one by one, go in the club, say the word, and  get banned.  And then what is he going to do?  Absolutely. 
[02:54:30]  Then what is he going to do?  You know what it is?  There's enough fucking faggot, wormy comics that wouldn't do it.  There's enough, I don't say that where they would hide because they're just, they're  just little pussies.  But Jamie needs, you know, I mean, trust me, it would, it would, it would, it would make  its point.  And it's only what?  $350.  Nothing to these guys.  Go in, say, get banned and just, uh, just make a massive list of, uh, of the who's who  of comedy doing this.  You know, we, we, we discussed in the office before the show.  So yeah, I mean, what Jamie should have done, and I don't even agree with this, if, if a 
[02:55:00]  comic is doing, you know, using the N word and it, and it's very hateful and it has nothing  to do with humor.  All right, Jamie, it's your club.  Freaking.  Yeah.  It's, it's your club.  Then, you know, then, uh, find the guy and ban it from your club.  All right.  But if it's still being used in humor, you're just out of your mind, out of your mind.  I can't say supercalifragilistic expialia.  She has one of 20.  He, he dared me to say that, and I just can't say that.  Supercalifragilistic expialidocious.  Yes. 
[02:55:30]  Uh, just a spoon full of sugar to make the medicine go down.  Does it?  Supercalifragilistic expialidocious.  Uh, Ben.  What make, what makes the eye not glass?  When the colored moves next door, I find it quite atrocious.  I'm sitting next to Andrew, and he has halitoids.  That's right.  We're laughing at you today.  Aw.  Aw, chubby bunny. 
[02:56:00]  Sorry, big A.  I know.  We've turned the corner.  We're kind of friends now.  I apologize.  I'm really sorry.  Going over the Opie house anytime soon.  He supports FH Riley.  You got to respect that.  What is that?  I don't know.  Uh, Ben from Pal Talk.  What's up?  Yeah.  And I'm Huntington, right?  Hey, boys.  I'm on 57th and Broadway.  I was wondering if I can get those tickets.  Sure.  Ben, I will give you a pair of tickets to the Islanders game tonight.  My seats.  That's awesome.  I will save you a pair.  I'm not kidding.  So I got another pair. 
[02:56:30]  So you're going to sit next to another fan, all right?  All right.  Should I come up, or what do you want me to do?  Yeah, come on by him.  I'm dead serious.  No, we'll throw him out the window.  Hold on the line, because there's going to have to be a code, because someone's going  to, like, claim they're Ben.  All right.  The code is, um, cock smuggler.  Blah.  All right.  You have to say it like that.  Yeah, when you come to the door, and Master Poe opens the door, say, uh, hi, I'm Ben,  and I'm a size queen.  That's right.  And then grab Poe's cock and go, you're not.  Can I?  Go, hi, I'm Ben, I'm a size queen, and Poe, FH Riley's, the FH doesn't stand for fuck here. 
[02:57:00]  That's right.  All right.  And you will get the tickets.  All right.  Thank you so much, boys.  By the way, I'm dead serious, so come on by and get your tickets.  By the way, and people don't know, but the FH of his Riley stands for fingering Herman.  Herman?  Why Herman?  That's the guy.  Well, there are a lot of Jews in Huntington.  Yes, they certainly are, and we all know what those hermits did when Herman fell asleep.  All right.  Are we ready for the, uh, the top ten greatest TV quotes and catchphrases chosen by TGW?  Ah, yes. 
[02:57:30]  So, yeah, you got to start at number ten, all right?  And we'll comment in between, hopefully.  Hopefully we'll have something witty to say in between.  Witty.  I doubt it, but.  Yeah.  All right.  Uh, go ahead.  Top ten greatest TV quotes.  Number ten.  I'm not a cook.  Or an actor.  Wow.  Were you trying to do Richard Nixon there?  Yeah, yeah.  That was terrific.  That was an impression.  That actually wasn't bad.  Can we hear it again?  That's Richard Nixon? 
[02:58:00]  Um, I'm not a cook.  It's closer to Cynthia Nixon.  That's horrible.  At least I tried, Anthony.  Ooh.  Oh, hey.  Oh, hey.  You tried.  What the fuck am I to say, huh?  Absolutely.  Come on there, pig H.  Help me out over here.  By the way, he sounded more like a Kennedy.  Yeah.  You know, we were going for Richard Nixon.  And you got to-  You have to, like, shake your-  And your hands.  Shake your cheeks around.  I can't actually do Richard Nixon, but I know you have to- 
[02:58:30]  And I'm not a cook.  Talk about the Jews.  The Jews.  Henry.  Do it right now.  Go ahead.  For real.  Mm-hmm.  Shake.  I'm not a cook.  He does these impersonations.  I swear, you would think it was the real people.  I mean, you can see how a white girl can fall for him.  Very good.  I am not a crook is number 10.  Mm-hmm.  Greatest TV quotes and catchphrases. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, it's quotes and catchphrases.  Yeah.  Yeah, sweetie.  Okay.  Yeah.  Now I really don't agree with this.  Why?  Chosen my TV lamp.  Why?  Because I just, as I'm looking at the list, I don't agree.  What, are you going to add some others?  Some of them, first of all, some of them are just timely.  They're not historic.  You could throw in something else, and I'll give an example when that comes around.  Mm-hmm.  The old T's.  I love how they have to get one very current one in here just to keep the list ridiculous.  That's what I mean.  It's like, stop it.  No one's going to remember-  In five years, no one's going to care.  No one's going to remember Donald Trump's stupid line in five years. 
[02:59:30]  Thank you, because that's exactly what I was talking about.  I do think that I'm not a crook is good.  I'm not a crook is a very good quote.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very memorable.  News quotes especially are, you know, are timely.  Hey, what's number nine?  I mean, number nine is probably going to be very exciting.  The number nine, Big A, the top ten greatest TV quotes and catchphrases.  Here's number nine.  Yeah, but that would do.  Black Fred?  Jesus.  Jesus Christ.  You want to do a little Black Fred? 
[03:00:00]  Tyrone Flintstone.  And you want to do a little Black Fred?  You have been known to do some Fred Flintstone.  Well, yeah, I'm trying to-  But there weren't any black people in the Flintstones.  Yo, Bonnie, why are we the only two?  I don't know, Fred.  Seems like a good neighborhood.  Was that good?  Had no locks on the doors?  Yeah.  Hadn't invented guns yet?  Yeah.  Isn't the future great?  Well, that was the-  Oh, wait.  That was the same thing.  That was the past. 
[03:00:30]  Flintstones wasn't in the future.  Yeah, but-  But wait, I'm going to argue that point, Jimmy.  What if it's the Planet of the Apes type future, where it's, you know, they're in the future,  but it looks like they went back in time.  That would be great.  But then again, Andrew is like the Flintstones.  Yeah?  Because he stops his car the same way.  Yeah.  Shove those big feet through the floorboards.  Those fucking giant, mushy, cushy feet. 
[03:01:00]  Someone is asking-  Car tips over when he gets lunch.  Hey, we're going to need someone that's really good on the board here, Bill.  Are you ready for this challenge?  Because people are asking for lines, and if they're in there, like this one, Mark from  Toronto, maybe we can look at the instant feedback and maybe get some of these.  That's why I wanted more of the list.  I actually asked for, like, the top 20 at least.  Yeah.  But they might only do the top 10.  What happened?  Sam!  Sam!  Put down that camera.  What happened?  Sam! 
[03:01:30]  It's not listed.  I asked Travis, and he said only the top 10 were available.  Well, Travis said that?  Yeah.  There's got to be a way to look online and see if it was where the rest is.  Um.  On TV land.  Why would they just print the top 10 and not all of them?  Sir?  I don't know.  Lily Anderson, Sam.  I like it.  Sam, try to do a deep voice.  I don't know.  It's kind of my camera.  My father used to hit me with my camera.  Where are you from?  New York.  Wow. 
[03:02:00]  I didn't know that.  You guys, I want to hear him try to sound deep.  Okay.  Deep voice.  Go ahead.  Deep voice.  I mean, you're black, so you should have a deep voice.  Put it on.  Somewhere in you.  What do you want me to say?  Something about camera, obviously.  I've got my camera.  Oh, yeah, baby.  Barry Half White.  Hey, by the way, someone wants to know. 
[03:02:30]  Hmm.  Tell them no.  Here it is.  Mark in Toronto.  What about, look at that little monkey run?  Now, that was a quote.  Did that make the list?

Yeah, yeah, sure.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it again.  Do it.  Where's the beef?  Big A saying, where's the beef?  Who are you kidding?  We saw that pal talk video.  We know where it's not.  Oh.  Oh.  Should be more like, where's the salad, huh, guys? 
[03:05:00]  Oh, I'm sorry, Big A.  We're friends.  I keep forgetting.  Jesus.  The famous Wendy's commercial lady.  Yeah.  Step up to the counter and said, where's the beef?  Who actually...  Okay.  Who actually died of lung cancer three days after that commercial was shot.  No.  Come on, Jimmy.  Okay.  I see it in your eyes.  Not that soon after.  Yeah.  She is dead, though.  Is she?  Yeah.  But then again, he knew where his hands were supposed to be.  I made the whole thing up.  I was acting.  Yeah.  I saw it.  I was acting. 
[03:05:30]  I gave it away with my head, though, because I did this.  And she died three days.  Left, right, left, right.  Yeah, that one was a very famous catchphrase.  People were fusing it all over.  Monologues on talk shows and everything.  Absolutely.  All right.  Number six.  Number six.  Top ten greatest TV quotes and catchphrases.  Don't.

And then there was the other Mr. Brady one, which was, you know, Peter, you're getting bigger  than your older brother.  Hey, hey, hey, vanilla gorilla.  Oh.  TV quote from all the way May.  Next large black man, please.  Why?  Why?  That was in a newsreel.  How do you pull her into this dumb thing? 
[03:07:00]  Absolutely.  Okay.  Now, big A.  Number six.  Stop kidding around.  Oh, number six.  Right.  We're still on out.  Josh and around.  Come on, big A.  Let's go.  Big A.  Is that really how it's done?  Yes.  Abrupt.  More emotion.  Maybe get a little longer.  And put a little more oomph behind it. 
[03:07:30]  Don't.  Holy shit.  Hey, Ben D., New York City Financial Center.  Here's a very famous catchphrase from Opie on The Late Show with David Letterman.  You have the timing of fucking, help me out, Jimmy. 
[03:08:00]  Eye cancer.  Jesus.  Why would you pick?  Of E-Rock?  Ah.  Exactly.  Because timing is everything.  What did he hit the button for?  I don't know.  Eric, why did he hit the button?  What was he over there?  I needed the machine at that moment.  E-Rock?  Why were you back there?  Why were you back there?  What did you do?  I was trying to load some of these in.  And I didn't know he was going right to it.  But his hand was kind of hovering.  I was like this.  You know, I saw that.  And I'm not a machine guy. 
[03:08:30]  Robot Dave from West Orange.  Famous TV quote from R. Bud Dwyer.  Yes.  Bam!  Bang.  Ah.  Oh, E-Rock.  Is he crying?  Oh, God.  No.  He did the smirking mouth thing and then just ran out.  Is he crying?  He should be.  Child sweatshirt.  Big A.  Tell everyone what E-Rock is.  By doing number six.  Mm-hmm.  Number six.  Go ahead.  Dope. 
[03:09:00]  Why a P?  Why is the P going in there?  Why are you gulping for oxygen?  How about you have to stretch the second part of that out?  Yeah.  The last two letters stretch them out.  Yeah, stretch them out.  Then people will understand what you're saying.  Yeah.  Not so abrupt.  Dope.  Dope.  Yeah, but now give it some energy.  Dope.  Back to dope.  Dope. 
[03:09:30]  Well.  Yes.  That's right.  The number six quote is the sound a wounded lion makes.  That was supposed to be.  Dope.  Dope.  Dope.  Homer Simpson.  You know?  Rusty Tillman checking in from the XFL.  Oh, no.  Please have him say the most memorable quote of all time.  Back to you, Rusty.  Back to you, Rusty. 
[03:10:00]  Back to you.  You guys are going old school today.  All right.  By the way, I haven't banned anyone on instant feedback.  I've never banned anyone on instant feedback, so don't worry about it.  Say whatever the fuck you want.  If you were banned, you wouldn't even know it, so shut up.  People are worried they got banned for either, you know, stating their opinion or whatever.  We didn't ban you.  All right.  Top ten greatest TV quotes and catchphrases.  We're up to number five.  We're halfway through.  Number five.  Now, Big A, dude, I want you to do this exactly how it was delivered when he said it. 
[03:10:30]  The accent, the timing.  Let her rip.  Do you know the whole quote without it being spelled out here?  I know some of it, but not all of it.  What?  You know the part that's written down?  What a coincidence.  Do you know the finish?  Do you know the money shot?  All right, give it a try.  All right, here we go. 
[03:11:00]  In your best accent.  This should be higher than stupid Donald Trump's.  Oh, I know.  This is so dumb.  Yep.  You better sound like him.  Come on, nail it.  Nail it.  One take.  If you don't sound like him, we give you a pink belly.  One take, Big A.  You're going to be covered with smoothie.  Unless you get this right.  Hurry up. 
[03:11:30]  Oh.  Oh, it's bad already.  Was that your teeth chattering that time?  Don't move next to me.  I didn't know what that was.  Stop moving.  Yeah, go ahead.  Come on.  Don't make us, like, tape your hands down again. 
[03:12:00]  You don't need to do that with your hands.  Now that we're friends, I've got to help you out a little bit.  All right.  There you go.  There goes the thumb.  Tap, tap.  Oh.  What?  Your thumb was, bro.  I'm staring at that thumb.  Jesus.  No, do number five.  Come on.  Ask.  Ask not what your country do for you. 
[03:12:30]  He did a better job after Oswald's third shot.  Jesus Christ.  The hell was that?  You sound like the Kennedy they gave the lobotomy to.  Scarecrow from Houston.  I believe all the way May's most popular quote on TV.  Or it would be the radio, you silly goose. 
[03:13:00]  Or snooze reel, maybe.  He's 90 now.  This would feel better if you painted the bat black.  Why am I getting involved with this abuse?  I don't know.  I'm blood.  So that was your wonderful...  That was your JFK impression?  Do it again.  You didn't sound like him.  Do the accent.  Ask not.  You know, he kind of...  And finish the quote, right?  He didn't finish.  Yeah, which your country can do for you.  But don't...  Let's see if he knows it.  Go ahead. 
[03:13:30]  Ask.  No, ask.  Ask.  Not.  Not.  Not.  Not.  Ask not.  Park the car in the garage.  What your country can do for you?  Let's go.  Ask what Marilyn could do for your cock.  Ask not.  Come on.  Ask not.  Not.  Not.  Not.  Ask not.  Ask not. 
[03:14:00]  What your country can do for you.  Yeah.  What can I do for your country?  What can I do for your country?  Jump off a fucking building.  Wait.  So the quote once again is...  Go ahead.  Once again.  I got to make sure I heard this.  Ask not.  Ask not.  And keep the accent after the first two words.  You pretty much keep your mouth open when you want to close it after a word. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  Ask not.  Not.  Say not.  What your country can do for you.  No.  Go ahead.  Ask.  Ask.  Not.  Ask.  Ask.  Not.  What your country can do for you.  This is going to go real old school.  He just sounded like Mayor Menino.  Mayor Menino.  He really did.  He always sounds like Mayor Menino.  Maybe ten people heard that. 
[03:15:00]  Ask not.  You have to finish the quote.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Mm-hmm.  Waiting.  I love that you can hear the tapping of the paper.  It's...  Tick, tick, tick, tick.  It's some of the best radio ever.  Run through the whole thing.  Yeah.  Let's go.  Beginning to end...  And finish the quote.  Ask not.  Ask not what your country can do for you. 
[03:15:30]  Ask what I can do for your country.  Oh, my God.  You're gold.  That is great.  Free appetizer for you at FH Riley's. 
[03:16:00]  What do you think of that?  Oh.  Huh?  That's number five.  I tell you, FH...  I think FH Riley's is a great place.  And what does the FH not stand for?  Oh, fuck you.  There you go.  Who knows?  I gave Big A my food the other night.  Really?  Went in just to say hi, and they gave me a plate of food that I didn't want.  I go, hey, Big A, here.  Treat.  Hey, nice.  Treat yourself.  Treat yourself.  You should have jumped on it.  I earned it.  I earned that.  Hey.  Look at Big A. 
[03:16:30]  He's improv.  Hey, look at that.  Callbacks.  That's terrific.  Hey, do the cops have to go?  You guys got to go?  Sort of?  All right, here.  One pair?  Because I promised the other pair to somebody else.  There's no...  Oh, they're not allowed on the air?  Just because they have haircuts like that, don't call them cops.  You don't know what they are for a living.  They're probably construction workers.  Some, uh...  They got the hair and, you know, those mustaches that the officers usually wear.  But you don't know what they are.  It's not like they're in uniform or anything. 
[03:17:00]  I'm giving a pair of my tickets to the Islanders game.  To some of New York's finest.  Keep it fair.  Keep it fair.  All right, thanks.  Thanks, guys, for what you do.  Enjoy the game tonight.  Thank you, gentlemen.  Stay safe out there.  And then I got another pair for that guy, Ben, if he ever shows up.  All right.  Where are we?  No tickets for you.  We're on number...  Four?  Four, because, yeah, John F. Kennedy.  Oof.  Shouldn't that have been...  I don't know. 
[03:17:30]  Maybe one, two...  Two, something up there.  Three.  You sounded like you did that quote with Marilyn on your face.  All right.  Number four.  Now, you've seen this before, right?  So you could probably do a bang-up impression.  You got the same physique.  Oh, yeah, you do.  So give it your best shot.  This one, everyone knows this.  Number four.  Baby, you're the greatest. 
[03:18:00]  Aw.  Aw.  You don't have to try to kiss Opie at the end of that.  Yeah, we're just friends.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Not Alice.  That was an awful, awful impression.  Yeah.  No, it was pretty good, I thought.  Yeah.  Baby, you're the greatest.  That from television, that's a pretty memorable quote.  Hey, Anthony, can I ask you something, though?  Certainly.  Stepping aside from the comedy here, you're a huge Honeymooners fan.  Sure.  I love the Honeymooners, but I don't know it as well as you do. 
[03:18:30]  Is that the greatest quote from that show?  It's probably the most known because it was used in almost every episode.  At the end, he would say Baby of the Greatest, the big closer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I kind of liked Get Out, one of my favorites, too.  Get Out.  Hey there, Ralphie boy.  Oh, hey there, Ralphie boy.  Hey there, Ralphie boy.  That's a good one.  That one, yeah.  I like when he was so pissed, he would just not even look at Norton.  He'd turn his head and just point at the door.  Yeah. 
[03:19:00]  Very, very theatrically a big point.  Yeah, the big looping finger would point at the door.  Norton would try to talk, and he would just loop it again, and finally just scream.  He'd be yelling.  He'd slam the door, and the whole wall would move, paint it on shadow.  Loved that goddamn show.  He was quite out.  Yeah.  All right.  Get Out.  Funniest guy ever.  Jackie Gleeson was the funniest guy.  Oh, yeah.  All right, number three, top ten greatest TV quotes and catchphrases. 
[03:19:30]  It's a big A, everybody.  Number three.  Number three, which doesn't even belong on this fucking list.  Oh.  You're all fired.  Wow.  He gave the hand motion and everything wrong, but he gets...  The timing was all wrong.  Donald just uses all fingers.  He doesn't just point.  He kind of slides his hand.  You're fired kind of a thing.  But you had it all wrong.  But what do we expect?  Yeah. 
[03:20:00]  That one shouldn't be on the list.  That is a catchphrase like, if this was done, let's say, eight years ago or something, it would have been, you're the weakest link.  Yeah.  That would have been on there.  Yeah.  It's one of those, like, it gets a big catchphrase.  Or is that your final answer?  Regis Philbin.  You know, who cares?  You're fired.  Belongs right there with Baby, You're the Greatest.  How about this?  Ahead of it?  See, they're not brave when they make these lists.  They always have to make it current so you have an interest in it. 
[03:20:30]  Ah.  What do we got?  What?  It's the whole list.  That's the whole list.  I know when there should be there.  Is that your final answer is on here?  Yeah.  I don't know what number it is.  How about this one?  Let's get ready to rumble.  Yeah.  Very famous quote.  Yeah.  This is in alphabetical order?  Why would they do that?  They want you to watch the show so you get their full rank in their fucking asses.  Fuck the show in their fucking asses.  They've published the whole list.  That show can suck a pack of baby dicks. 
[03:21:00]  No soup for you.  Why should they be rewarded?  Take a clown shoe and fuck them in the ass.  The truth is out there from the X-Files.  Tastes great, less filling.  The Miller Lite ads.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was kind of a catchphrase.  Well, they're bigger than you're fired.  Those quotes.  You're fired. 
[03:21:30]  You rang, Lurch.  Don't make me angry.  Dynamite by JJ.  That's bigger than you're fired.  Dynamite.  Oh, my God.  How is Dynamite not in the top ten?  I tell you why.  Why?  Because he's a tall guy.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  I don't see any representation on this list.  Because he's good in sports.  How about for what you're talking about, Wills?  Good night, John Boyd.  Yep.  Live long and prosper.  Yeah.  All right.  Book him, Dano.  Book him, Dano. 
[03:22:00]  Huge.  You're fired.  That should not make the list.  From what's happening?  Hey, Rog, where's my legs?  All right.  Let's go with number two here.  By the way, this would make a great internet video.  Having him do the top ten greatest TV quotes and catch Roger's podcast.  In his style.  A clodcast.  Here we go.  Bumbling idiot.  Okay. 
[03:22:30]  Number two.  The runner-up.  Greatest TV quote and catchphrase of all time.  Number two.  I got my left.  Oh, no.  That hurts.  Here's number two.  One smalls.  Oh, boy.  It's out of oxygen.  Don't cheat.  Don't cheat.  Say the word.  You should know this when it happened on your stomach. 
[03:23:00]  One smalls.  Aldrin already left.  Stand out to try to get these words out.  Splash down.  Thirteen's on their way.  For man.  Yes.  Finish.  One giant.  You sleep for mankind.  Asking or telling.  Stupid teacher used to say that to me all the time. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah.  The giraffe.  Asking or telling.  Telling.  I just said it.  You figure it out.  Stupid cunt.  No beam me up, Scotty?  Beam me up, Scotty.  By the way, he never said that.  He's dead, Jim.  Supposedly, he never said beam me up, Scotty.  Beam me up, Scotty.  Never, never, Scotty.  Beam me up, Scotty.  Scotty, beam me up.  Did he ever say, Scotty, beam me up?  No.  He was just beam me up.  That was one of those dumb things. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah.  It's like things that never happened.  Scotty, Scotty.  One of them.  I like when he had to tap his communicator.  Yeah.  Scotty.  Hello.  Hello.  A little help here.  Elo showing him a communicator that gets XM.  Kirk don't care.  He's fucking a green broad.  All right.  The big finish with Big A.  The top ten greatest TV quotes and catchphrases.  By the way, I think number two should have been number one.  Of course.  Really?  You got a guy.  He's on the fucking moon.  He's on the moon.  For the first time on the moon.  First time.  First words on the moon. 
[03:24:30]  That's a top phrase.  That's right.  Doesn't have to be a catchphrase.  All right.  Here's number one.  Give him an offer he can't refuse.  Drum roll, please.  Huge.  Here's Tommy.  That is a great Nicholson impression from The Shining.  Unfortunately, he meant Ed McMahon from The Tonight Show. 
[03:25:00]  So do it again, Ed McMonster.  Wait, no.  Ed McMahon.  Ed McMahon-a-tee. 
[03:25:30]  Ed McMahon-a-tee.  All right.  Big A, do it again.  You got to have a lot more E's.  See the E part?  Yeah.  You got to draw that part out a little bit.  Greatest TV quote of all time. 
[03:26:00]  Or catchphrase.  Here's Big A.  Here's Johnny.  You call him Ed McMushmouth.  Ed McSteak.  Ed McMuffin.  Oh, God.  All right.  Fantastic.  There you go.  Great job.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box. 
[03:26:30]  Wow.  You are entertaining.  By the way, Paul from Philly.  Beam me up, Scotty.  It was never used in the original show, but it was used in the 70s cartoon.  By the way, despite evidence given here, I am not a virgin. 
[03:27:00]  It's pretty funny, actually.  Paul from Philly.  What about Khan?  What about Frunkus?  They didn't make the list.  Well, you haven't done that on TV yet.  That's the only reason.  Or that would be number one.  That'll be number one on the next...  The thrill of victory, the agony of...  Oh, this is a head of nose quote.  Uh-oh.  The thrill of victory, the agony of the foot.  The foot.  Stop.  Hey, can we give Big A the list?  Big A, why don't you read some of the ones that you were surprised didn't make the top ten.

Let's go.  Fancy's hungry.  Book him.  Book him, Dano.  Yeah, that didn't make it.  No, it's good.  Hawaii 5-0. 
[03:28:00]  Hawaii 5-0-0.  This one should have been on.  Oh, okay, yeah.  He made the opening scene by jumping in the water.  He's known as the big idiot.  Number one?  I mean, another one from you, yes? 
[03:28:30]  Come on.  Come on down.  Johnny Olsen.  Price is right.  Your doctor, to your cholesterol.  Ed McNum Tong.  Kevin from Beverly, Massachusetts.  Actually, I think this one will fit in perfect for me.

[03:30:00]  Well, that bad was it.  He sure didn't say it the way I wanted him to.  God damn it.  You ruined my joke, you fuck.  What was it?  How did you have it written?  It's the plane.  It says it.  The plane.  What the pilot says so he can take off.  It's because you're fat. 
[03:30:30]  Good grief, said by Charlie Downs.  Brian from St. Lawrence.  Someone's asking if there's something from Chips.  Not Lay's, the show Chips.  Wife to Macmillan.  You're a what?

I don't know.  What about Don't You Think You Were a Little Hard on the Beaver last night?  Was that ever really said, though?  No.  I don't know.  No.  She did say you were a little hard on the beaver.  I saw that episode. 
[03:32:00]  How about this one there, Big A?  This was a really big one.  Oh, it's not even on the list.  Oh, boy.  I've fallen and I can't get up.  We're just whispering over here.  I'll do this so you can talk.  And it's trying to figure out something.  Wait, let me see.

[03:37:30]  There you go.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh, we've got a really big, uh, shoe.  Nike Town, when you went to get some sneakers.  I'm trying to end with a huge laugh here. 
[03:38:00]  Let's see, uh, what Big A's got.  You, uh, you, uh, spunk.  What someone says to Travis and they examine his beard.  Oh, if we're going to pick on other people.  All right.  Should we take a break?  Yeah.  Big A, good job.  That was good. 
[03:38:30]  Good job, Big A.  As always.  He's just kid a little fucking manners.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll, uh, do something next.  What that is, we don't know yet.  Dude, what happened?  It'll knock you on your goddamn ass.  Jesus Christ, what an anticlimactic piece of crap that was.

[03:39:30]  Shit fuck.  Back on.  Yeah, it's Eric Logan in studio.  Looking very good in his, uh, black suit.  And I hate to admit that.  He loves looking very handsome in his little outfit.  I say to everybody, Eric Logan, a CEO in training.  Yes.  It's just a matter of time before he's a CEO for somebody.  Absolutely.  As long as that hard drive is never checked on his computer,  and those files are never questioned.  They're doing that at the company, by the way.  They should.  Good.  Are they?  Good.  Go on with that stuff.  I mean, at CBS, I know words hurt, but for us, images hurt. 
[03:40:00]  Yeah.  Did you enjoy the words hurt segment of the show today?  You know, it was...  What?  Words hurt.  It was very warming, because obviously you got my email about that, about how words hurt.  Our policy is hurt more.  Yeah.  We had the same courtesy laugh.  I actually liked it.  I enjoyed it.  It was a laugh of agreement as well.  We got the same pamphlet from XM.  It was eight blank pages.  That's right.  Words hurt.  Words hurt.  All it said was terrestrial on page one. 
[03:40:30]  Everything they tell you not to do, do here.  Do it.  So, Elo, you were giving us some really good news during the break.  What can you say on the air?  Because, you know, people need to hear something, because you guys are always secretive about  subs and an amount of people listening to a particular show or channel.  Right.  You've got to say something.  Make us look like superstars right now.  Well, here's what I can tell you guys.  No matter what anybody says or any other, I don't know, we call them personalities, I  wouldn't even call them major personalities anymore.  Jizz buckets. 
[03:41:00]  Jizz buckets.  I can't believe I just said jizz buckets.  Jizz buckets.  He was a CEO in the making.  Yeah.  He was, right.  For the porn awards, maybe.  I don't know.  He was until he said this.  Jizz buckets.  Yeah.  No, but if you know what, I will tell you this.  When you look at the popularity of the channel on for the XM subs, it is the number one channel,  1834, because you guys talk about ratings on the terrestrial side and talk about how  you're growing there.  Out of all the XM channels, 1834, Opie and Anthony, number one.  That's amazing. 
[03:41:30]  Number one.  Oh.  Got a couple claps out there.  Yeah.  And by the way, the other thing, too, it's like I love all the articles I read about how  this show is failing and how you guys are colossal failures.  And what I can tell you is that when you talk about how bad you're failing at Satellite  Radio, what we'll say is this.  Multiple millions, more than three, more than four, we'll leave it at that, are listening  to 202 over the course of a week.  More than five. 
[03:42:00]  You can make a very strong case for more than five.  Oh.  See?  More than five points.  I knew it.  I knew it.  The point is that people will say, nobody's listening to Satellite Radio, nobody's listening  to this.  We have seven plus million subscribers, and most of the fans who have a radio have radios  in their places of work, and each radio has 10, 15 different people around.  Yeah.  Well, what we wind up doing is we find out how many people are listening and how many 
[03:42:30]  additional people listen for those radios, and that's how we get to the numbers.  All right.  Here's the tough question.  What the hell?  Let's get some ink today.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  The merger talk.  What can you say?  Cue crickets.  I couldn't reach it.  Size queen?  Wait a minute.  Size queen.  Nice.  He knows where it is.  Wait a minute.  Yeah, that's Mel talking. 
[03:43:00]  Oh.  Now, look, I mean, the merger talk.  I mean, listen, we've all worked for Mel before.  Exactly.  And, you know, it's just, it's all talk.  I mean, we're-  It is all talk.  Just talk.  You just made me nervous when you said we've all worked for him before.  I thought you were going to say, we'll learn and do it again.  And we'll work for him again.  I was going to fucking sit here and be-  I don't know.  It all didn't work out well for us last time, so.  Let me tell you something.  Their whole thing where they had to announce that they're-  Lowering the subs.  Lowering their expectations of subs really hit them hard in the market. 
[03:43:30]  I think, well, not I think, I know.  Mel knew that statement was coming out before it did.  He knows.  So he tried to counter by pumping up, you know, a little speculation.  Merger talks are possible.  In my humble opinion.  All right, wait.  I am a show!  Ah!  Hey, wait a minute.  Because we've got a lot of people listening in right now.  Yeah.  Let's see.  I'm just getting the quotes for the press.  Elo. 
[03:44:00]  Elo.  What's your title over at XM these days?  Executive Vice President.  Executive Vice President of XM Satellite Radio.  EDP.  Had this to say on the Opie and Anthony show.  Writing a statement?  Jizz buckets.  That's right.  And we'd rather merge with Robert Reed's asshole.  And he said, merger talk is just that.  All talk, right?  Let's talk.  That's your quote?  If my quote-  They're going to print it.  They're not-  No one's called me to talk about a merger.  And who'd you call a jizz bucket, by the way?  All of Sirius Satellite Radio or- 
[03:44:30]  Big A.  Big A, I think it was, actually.  God, I hope there's jizz bucket in your statement.  FMQBL printed.  Oh, yes.  Elo jizz buckets.  My luck.  Yeah, Mike's listening on-  Calling Sirius Satellite Radio jizz buckets.  Well, you know, I had to get off PalTalk.  You know, because I used to be on PalTalk every morning.  I had to get off because-  I know, the real Elo.  Why?  Raging hard on?  Raging hard on.  What?  Oh.  Whatever.  They bounce you because it's not a jacking room. 
[03:45:00]  Exactly.  Well, no, I would go on there and say something.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  It would be on-  Hold on!  I'm updating my quotes.  Elo gets off PalTalk on PalTalk, right?  Gets off on PalTalk.  Yes.  Elo gets off on PalTalk?  On PalTalk?  Something like that.  Like he had to get off or he gets off on PalTalk.  Something about getting off on PalTalk.  He kept getting booted out of the teen room.  All right, I got it.  For porn on my computer.  For porn on my monitor.  Elo gets off.  A little Freudian slip there. 
[03:45:30]  Yes.  Elo gets off something.  Why do they-  Something.  I forgot what he said, but he gets off.  Why did you have to get a PalTalk?  Well, the pests would corner me with these IMs, and they would start asking things, and then  they'd copy my statements and start posting them on message boards.  You know what?  I never gave you admin privileges.  I know.  You just bounce me.  I will make you an admin, so you will have the ability to bounce whoever you want.  Oh, that'll be fun.  And you can block people, too.  Yep.  And you can block them.  Opie!  Ooh, ooh, ooh. 
[03:46:00]  Go Opie.  We're talking about the merger or whatever between the two companies and stuff, and Dogshit  Sniffer writes, Elo.  That's actually his real name.  Elo, if this was to go down, would this be the biggest merge since Mel's Tongue and  Howie's Dirty Spot?  Dirty Spot.  Wow, that merger took place many years ago.  Yeah, well.  It still happened.  Of course it has.  Let me ask you a question about the commercial that was done for XM Satellite Radio.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  Looking forward to it.  Have you seen any footage? 
[03:46:30]  I will see a rough cut today.  Oh.  Oh, see?  I was hoping to see the rough cut.  Yeah, it's going to be this afternoon.  I just talked to Gary.  I'm worried about my performance.  Why?  I have heard, by the way, I have heard that it is hysterical.  I was worried.  Your performance is very funny.  When I marched in, everyone laughed, and what did Anthony say?  It was just absolutely correct.  It was something about, I was Schneider from One Day at a Time.  That was exactly. 
[03:47:00]  It was Schneider.  Hey, Ms. Romano.  You just walked in like Schneider from One Day at a Time and told us a thing or two.  Where's Wicklin, by the way?  He's around.  We told him you were coming, and his quote was, I don't give a shit.  I'm busy.  Yeah.  That's what Don says.  Actually, I heard him say, fuck that guy.  Whoa.  Yeah.  What happened?  Wicklin.  Did he really?  Get us in here.  What?  What?  But I thought he was...  Yeah, I thought he was, too.  That's what I want to try to get to the bottom.  Yeah.  Get to the bottom.  Come here, Donnie.  Get to the power bottom of this.  Come here, Donnie.  Watch this. 
[03:47:30]  Watch this.  There he comes.  Elo's a good boy, man.  Watch this.  He plays right along.  I love the Elo.  By the way, before we move on, Jimmy's outtakes from the XM commercial are going to be just  massively huge.  They're going to be big.  Heist the ripple.  Break.com, everything else.  So now, by the way, just for the record, just so you know, earlier this week, I received  a communique from Don Wicklin that said, I'm departing for Vegas, and he's going there  for his birthday.  All right.  Sounds cool.  So he calls, good place to go for your birthday. 
[03:48:00]  Hell yeah.  Calls me when he gets back from Vegas.  I'm in my car.  And he goes, I got news to tell you.  I said, what, are you married or something?  And then it was just deathly silent.  Don?  Ding.  Wow.  Ding.  What did you share with us, what you told me about the wedding ceremony?  Don Wicklin.  You got married in Vegas?  Congratulations, man.  Wow.  Wow.  Now, the rumor was you were actually gay.  Yeah.  The scuttlebutt.  All right.  Now that you're married, everyone that works for XM Satellite Radio was positive you were 
[03:48:30]  gay.  Holy shit, Elo, are you drunk?  Yeah.  No, no.  I'm fine.  He's drunk.  I'm high on life.  Elo admitted he was drunk on Opie and Anthony's show.  But it has taken the D.C. compound by storm, Jim, that Don has been...  Gay Don, as he was known.  Gay, gay Don.  Right.  Donna.  Donna the Saga, Wade.  And said, wow, he thought he was gay.  He's just going like...  What the...  This is the first...  That look, I don't know where Sam is. 
[03:49:00]  I mean, he couldn't know.  But that look, it was a fucking...  Marsha Clark didn't look as stunned what she heard, not guilty.  You've never seen a more shocked look.  Yeah.  That look told me all I needed to know.  He really had no idea people thought that.  No.  No idea.  Wow.  Well, all the pests.  I mean, everybody talked about it.  A few people assumed.  But you're happily married.  Indeed.  Yep.  And she's a lovely woman.  Yes, she's a lovely woman.  Someone needs to say it.  Thanks, Ope.  She's a nice girl. 
[03:49:30]  All right.  Thanks, Jimmy.  All right.  I just wanted to be a big...  Hot, too.  ...congratulate Don.  Absolutely.  Congratulations.  But I still think it might be a cover.  A beard.  They call it a beard.  Wow.  I apologize.  What the...  He's true.  Ah, look at Don.  What the hell?  Where the hell did this come from?  Wow, he's pissed.  But Ark's drunk.  I'm drunk.  I've admitted that I've been drunk.  Have you been sober?  Never.  He's just drunk all the time.  Elo hasn't been sober since he was 15.  And he could count on his hand more times he's seen me sober than drunk. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Anything else you want to admit here, Elo?  I like slamming a few back with that, Elo.  Absolutely.  Elo is a fun guy to drink with.  Yeah.  There are...  You know, there's some people that are kind of fun, and then they get obnoxious or something  like that.  Fun guy to pound some back with.  He keeps it fun the whole time?  He keeps it fun the whole time.  It doesn't turn into...  ...fucker.  Especially in somebody else's dime.  Yeah.  Like in a minibar.  Oh, minibar.  Bob.  Nothing more fun than a minibar drunk. 
[03:50:30]  I love those.  By the way, Bob...  Little toot bottles.  I was talking to Bob recently, our super agent.  The big story after a Letterman appearance, the dinner bill was what?  $2,000?  Oh, my God.  How much?  It was like $2,300 or $2,800.  No, it was $2,800, actually.  Oh, okay.  It was $2,800.  Elo was drunk and decided to order a $1,200 bottle of wine for everybody.  It was a bottle of wine, yeah.  And then another bottle that was like $600.  And then...  I saw him filling these huge bottles out of a box with a tap on it.  Yeah.  And then he proceeds to give super agent Bob Eatman the bill. 
[03:51:00]  Yeah.  And then he says, ah, don't worry.  We'll split it.  We'll split it.  He was talking about that stupid bill the other day.  Bob went into shock.  He talks about that dumb bill.  He's still going to try to get the money from you.  I laughed at him.  I know.  And my 80-pound lobster I ordered.  And he also talks about the time that Anthony...  Five, six-pound lobster, was it?  Oh, it was ridiculous.  At how many dollars a pound these days?  What, 20-some-odd...  What is it?  For an lobster?  Yeah, a pound.  Oh, at a Manhattan restaurant? 
[03:51:30]  Honestly, I think it was about $30 a pound.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And Ant was so pissed off that super agent Bob Eatman at the time was kind of, you know,  not working as hard.  I don't know.  I mean, we had our own opinions about that.  We were just annoyed at something.  We were just annoyed.  All right, so Anthony turns around and goes, I'll have the five-pound lobster at $30 a  pound.  Yeah, of course you will.  That was great.  So are we taking any trips soon?  Yeah.  Good.  Yeah.  We're going to go to Vegas and all get married. 
[03:52:00]  Yeah, apparently so.  I don't know.  I might be ready.  Oh.  Let's just say that.  Wow.  Stop it.  I know a good place.  Really?  Yeah.  Don got married at a drive-thru.  Yeah.  Did you?  Did you do the drive-thru?  It was the same one that Michael Jordan got married.  Yeah, that doesn't mean anything.  Just like Michael Jordan.  Jesus.  You're not like him.  Look what's hurt.  What do you mean I'm not?  How are you doing?  You're not like him.  They all thought what and I'm not what?  People think E-hole rules. 
[03:52:30]  All right, so no merger.  Jizz buckets.  E-hole gets off.  And he's drunk.  Get that off.  FMQB will quote this show.  Right.  And you will not pay the $2,800 bill.  You know what's so funny?  He didn't even send me the invoice.  Somebody in his office sent me the invoice.  Yeah.  So I put it into our-  They actually sent you the invoice?  Oh, they sent me a copy and they divided the total by two.  Yeah.  Oh, God, Bob.  And they sent it to me.  Jesus.  I looked at it.  I laughed.  Bob.  Bob was in shock.  And then I got a 30-day statement that said we're overdue.  You did not.  Oh, no, I did.  Keep it real. 
[03:53:00]  Really?  No, no.  And then I take it and I put it into our great payment system we have at XM, which drags  things out.  Please tell me he sues you for that bill.  I hope so.  I will laugh.  Yeah.  You know what?  I got to apologize for him.  That is just-  It's fine.  It's fine.  All kidding aside, Bob.  That's embarrassing.  Let it go.  I was fucking let it go.  I'm now waiting for the bill for the minibar because between Anthony and I, we destroyed  that minibar in Bob's room.  Yeah, in Bob's room.  Oh, completely.  Yeah, Bob invited us up to the room.  Oh, that was a mistake.  We went right for the minibar and he just had this look on his face like a calculator 
[03:53:30]  was going in his head with every little bottle we're pulling out and beers and booze  bottles.  Boy, the Litterman Show couldn't get on fast enough.  Oh, mixing drinks.  Bob is a chiseler and a pinch penny, if I may.  Bob's a pinch penny.  Keep some tight purse strings.  He certainly did.  Bob, you're a tightwad.  I got two quick Bob stories.  I was driving around with him and his wife in Southern California and we went through  a toll booth.  Yeah.  75 cent toll. 
[03:54:00]  Got a receipt.  Those add up?  Oh, please.  And then I found out that as...  Oh, man.  We were just kidding.  I saw him pull a buck out of an old bar mitzvah card.  Still got some of that money.  Oh, hell.  Why have a filter now?  His wife's not allowed to use the minibar at hotels.  They get snacks ahead of time.  Oh, my God.  You know what the difference between a Hershey bar at a store and a Hershey bar at a minibar 
[03:54:30]  costs?  It's the convenience.  It is the convenience.  It's just fun to sit back with little bottles of booze and pass out on your bed with Elo.  Wow.  You gotta love it.  I'm sorry.  Bob has all the fun of a colostomy nozzle.  He just doesn't have fun.  Bob needs to have fun.  That's why he's a great agent.  He's all business.  By the way, I got one more pair of tickets to see the Islanders tonight. 
[03:55:00]  My personal tickets.  Did that Ben guy ever show up?  You're the Ben guy?  We see you all the time.  Oh, hi.  What was that?  He does the walkover almost every day.  Oh, okay.  Hi, Ben.  Come on in and get your tickets.  I didn't know it was you.  I thought you were just here checking out the show again.  He's putting his coat on.  Yeah, I gotta go.  I gotta flight to catch.  You have...  I gotta flight to catch.  I don't know how you do it.  We got lines of the day.  We got lines of the day.  We got a big meeting to go through.  Okay, I'll do lines of the day, but I can't...  I'd love to stay for that meeting, but I've already said I'm not going to make it. 
[03:55:30]  Your son.  Opie will represent me in the meeting, and I will be briefed.  I'm sure emails will be sent out.  Doing a quick meeting right here before lunch.  Before lunch.  Like 15 minutes.  Yeah, we're not...  I know you're not doing lunch.  And I have young E-Rock representing me, because I will miss him in that one.  You proxied your input to E-Rock?  To E-Rock, yes.  Proxy.  Hold on.  Ben, enjoy the game.  Those are my actual seats.  Can I say one thing?  Yeah.  Go ahead, Ben.  To a mic.  Get a mic.  I'm Ben from PalTalk, and I'm a size queen. 
[03:56:00]  Attaboy.  Did they dare you to say that on the air?  Did I?  No, we told him that's what he had to say, to get the tickets.  Oh.  Oh, really?  Okay.  Good boy.  You're honest.  Don, I'm looking for some kind of window treatments for my house.  Do you have any suggestions?  I don't know what to go with.  I've asked all my friends.  They have not a clue either.  Just think maybe.  No?  Nothing.  Oh.  Yeah.  I thought I'd ask.  I don't know why.  I just pick around the person in the room. 
[03:56:30]  He is fucking livid.  Look at the look on his face.  I've already hired Poe to escort me for the rest of the afternoon.  Good.  And Poe does a fabulous job.  Certainly does.  While you're being attacked, he's looking and pointing at somebody.  Look, you're shiny, gentlemen.  All right.  Here we go.  Line of the day.  We've got three runner-ups.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  What a day.  It was a banner day.  Sponsored by BodogFight.com. 
[03:57:00]  Log on and watch American fighters battle for the right to represent the U.S.  They're going to do that against the Russians, I guess.  It's all on BodogFight.com.  You know, it could just be that you're well-dressed and nice.  Yeah.  That's a nice guy.  I mean, Anthony, that was nice.  Thank you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fucker.  It doesn't have to.  Oh, that's sexual harassment.  I don't care.  Wow.  Holy Jesus.  I'm getting the hell out of here right after this show.  Absolutely.  All right.  Listen, first runner-up line of the day.  I've got my camera. 
[03:57:30]  Oh, yeah, baby.  Barry Half-White.  There you go.  Our own Sam.  We don't know if he's black or white, and we wanted a deep voice out of the kid today.  And there you go.  He's got a high voice.  There's the setup.  All right.  Here's the second runner-up line of the day.  By the way, this would make a great internet video, having him do the top ten greatest TV  quotes and catch roses.  Podcast.  In his style.  A clodcast.  There we go.  Old leave-it-to-beaver words. 
[03:58:00]  That's great.  What an adult.  And he's also a wet blanket.  A zilch.  He needs to get bent.  Some dude on Instant Feedback, he just keeps writing boring, boring, boring, boring.  Like, I don't get why you're listening then, dude.  Like, how is that supposed to get to us?  People that really do find this show boring, they're long gone.  Long gone.  Long gone doing something else. 
[03:58:30]  You just look like an idiot.  You do, you goose.  Here is the final runner-up line of the day.  Can't wait.  Jizz Buckets.  That's all it is.  E-Lo saying Jizz Bucket.  E-Lo gets a runner-up line of the day.  Wow.  Where's my plaque?  This Jizz Bucket line.  All right, and finally, here is today's line of the day sponsored by BodogFight.com.  Here comes the line of the day. 
[03:59:00]  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Here's Johnny.  That is a great Nicholson impression from The Shining.  Unfortunately, he meant Ed McMahon from The Tonight Show. 
[03:59:30]  So do it again, Ed McMaster.  Wait, no.  Ed McMaster.  I wish that one would have come out a little bit smoother.  I just couldn't not laugh.  How could you not?  That is very funny.  Man, you did a great job today.  Yes.  All right, with that, we're out of here.  Wait, wait, wait.  We've got to congratulate Don.  Seriously, we get married.  We all know his girl. 
[04:00:00]  She's great.  You know what?  No, no.  Don, Don.  It's all a joke.  Don.  He's so sensitive.  He really is sensitive.  They always are.  Don.  Don, come back.  Don just walked off the show.  He's really, really pissed off.  He really is.  You can see in his eyes.  He was kind of looking.  Oh.  You're just showing that you're sensitive.  You're going to sit down and take it.  Everyone's been thrown under the bus. 
[04:00:30]  Exactly.  Yeah.  Bus, a man, whatever.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Obviously, he's not.  Stop.  Yeah.  All right.  Come on.  I wonder if it was when Elo said, everyone from the DC compound is reeling from this.  Everyone.  He said everyone.  I know.  He said.  Not a couple people.  No.  No.  It's everybody. 
[04:01:00]  Usually, when I come in, I'm less hostile.  Yeah.  I just have had no meetings where I've had to be like corporate Elo.  I could just come in and just, you know.  Yeah.  That's very funny.  Just be me.  Elo.  All right.  We got to.  We got to.  All right, guys.  Remember, New Year's Eve, Borgata.  I'll be there.  My pals, Opie and Anthony, will go.  Wouldn't miss it.  I'm not going now.  Why, Opie?  I changed my mind.  I want you to go.  I want a party hat and noisemakers during your act.  Can they hand out the noisemakers during your act?  No.  So it goes. 
[04:01:30]  As you're trying to do your act.  No.  Who told me this story?  Was it you on stage?  You got so pissed off at the audience and you were doing a New Year's Eve show?  No, Dice.  They've done that before.  Was it Dice?  You counted down at the wrong time?  Yeah, counted down at the wrong time just to fuck with everybody?  Yeah.  And then left the stage and everyone thought it was New Year's and then it wasn't?  What's the difference, though?  I guess.  Ten minutes?  I still think it's pretty funny.  It is funny.  Elo, always a pleasure. 
[04:02:00]  Thank you.  Bye, guys.  Thank you for the info.  The info.  The inside skinny, if I may.  Scoop.  In your humble opinion, no merger.  Anytime soon.  Who knows?  Oh, boy.  You just fucked up the whole thing.  Oh, wow.  That is a – you know what that translates to?  Yes, it's happening.  It's in the works.  I have no idea.  But it could take longer.  You're not in that loop, right?  Well above my pay scale.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Just curiosity.  Let's say two companies were in a merge. 
[04:02:30]  Not necessarily these two companies, but two companies.  How do you decide who the CEO is?  Yeah.  That is – actually, when corporate mergers happen, that's one of the biggest issues.  Really?  Yeah.  It's a lot different when you buy somebody.  But if companies merge, it becomes an issue of who runs who.  So what do you think would happen in this situation?  Arm wrestling.  Yeah.  Yeah, do it out on the air.  Best out of three.  I certainly think the bigger wins.  You know, size matters.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  So there is going to be a merger.  All right.  Got to work for Mel again. 
[04:03:00]  How are you going to get federal regulations?  He hates this show.  He just has blinders on.  He thinks Howard, and that's it.  Always has.  Always will.  It's working out well.  I respect the loyalty, but that's just stupid.  Loyalty.  You see him the other day saying that, hey, this isn't all about Howard over here.  Yeah.  Come over for music and other things.  Did you notice that?  Yeah.  That was the first time I've ever heard him say that.  First time I ever heard that when I read that.  Yeah.  He's like, no, there's plenty of other stuff here. 
[04:03:30]  We got this and this.  It's not all about Howard.  Oh, really?  Yeah, 12 months ago it was.  That's what you pushed it as for a year.  Yeah.  Now, since that dwindled down to nothing, you've got to start pushing other stuff.  It's like betting the Kentucky Derby.  You're life-saving on a horse and there's a gainer out of the gate.  Yeah.  Oh, money in the bank.  Here it is.  Money in the bank.  Look at this guy go.  It's a long race, my friend.  That's right.  All right, Edlo, we give you the last word.  What do you got?  Jizz bucket. 
[04:04:00]  The current it boys of FM Talk are the New York-based duo of Opie and Anthony.  And the talk is racy and raw at times, pushing the limits as far as they can.  Show your hairy pork chop.  My mother smokes crack rocks.  I'm for drunk teens.  What are you kidding?  How about I lay you down and give you a little bukkake?  We laugh.  We're going to have a disgusting body fluid blowout.  Gay porn.  Bow.  Hey, could you soap up your bad place?  The sluttier, the better.  I would definitely be willing to have sex with you if we both already had AIDS. 
[04:04:30]  It's certainly not your father's talk radio.  Line of the Day is brought to you by Bodog.  If you'd like to vote on any of the weekly show polls, go to ilictolisten.com. </pre>
