<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast unfolded as a chaotic and highly profane rollercoaster of segments.  It began with Anthony Cumia's escalating fury over his perpetually malfunctioning computer, culminating in a threat to destroy it within a day if it wasn't fixed. This rant was interwoven with a discussion of Reverend Al Sharpton's surprisingly uneventful protest, which the hosts mocked for its lack of anticipated chaos.  They compared the protest's underwhelming nature to a boring movie and contrasted it with the media's reaction to Don Imus' controversial statements.  Comedian Bill Burr called in to promote his shows, and listener emails and calls, including one from "Mendoza the Jew," were interspersed throughout this segment.  Jimmy Norton shared an anecdote about Rob Halford of Judas Priest's pungent body odor, and a caller described a home invasion, highlighting a building's security flaw.  The hosts also interviewed Scorch, a radio DJ planning a 24-hour dog cage stunt for charity, offering him suggestions to make it more provocative.

The show then transitioned to a listener-submitted photo of a man resembling various celebrities, sparking speculation ranging from Big Enos to Vincent Price. This segued into a discussion about bee stings, fueled by a news story about a bee swarm.  Callers shared their own stinging experiences, with one recounting being stung 100 times. The Schmidt Sting Pain Index was mentioned, and a previous show segment about genital bee stings was teased.  Comedians Rich Voss and Robert Kelly received brief promotional mentions.

The next segment began with more bee sting anecdotes, including a caller whose wedding photos were ruined by a wasp. This abruptly shifted to a discussion of a police brutality video, followed by a story from Mike from Jersey about a car crash caused by a bee-fearing friend jumping from a moving vehicle, resulting in the caller assaulting his friend.  Francine was in studio, sharing a thank-you card for Jimmy with a racial inside joke. This led to a discussion about dating, sex, and race, marked by vulgar language. Francine also mentioned her new TV production job.  The segment included outtakes from a drunken Orson Welles champagne commercial, "Sounds of Our Listeners," and a "Douche Chill Theater" segment with Robert Kelly.  Further discussions about Francine’s dating life and Hillary Clinton's political announcement concluded this segment.

The broadcast continued with a bizarre collection of loosely connected topics.  A listener submitted a breast-slapping sound effect, which transitioned into discussions of sinkholes, a Borat breast clip, and a sound effect allegedly mimicking Keith the Top sniffing Anthony's underwear.  This sparked a graphic discussion about the underwear's smell and Keith’s masturbatory habits.  Studio guest Pat Duffy joined, initiating a discussion about declining honeybee populations and their impact.  A heated conflict erupted between Tony and Pat Duffy, filled with personal insults, accusations, and near-physical altercations, escalating to the point where objects were thrown at Pat Duffy, culminating in him leaving the studio.

Another segment focused on a physical altercation between interns Pat and Poe, and the intense animosity between Pat and Sam.  The hosts detailed Pat’s anger issues, contrasted with his usually calm demeanor, speculating on the reasons behind his rage.  Explicit descriptions of Pat's violent fantasies about Sam were shared, culminating in a tense, mediated standoff ending with a strained handshake.  The hosts used highly offensive language throughout.  Jamie Kennedy's film "Heckler" was briefly promoted.

The show concluded with a discussion of an Amish documentary, followed by crude jokes about sex and the Amish lifestyle. This transitioned into a discussion of Bill Clinton's age and memory, and a caller's comments on Amish practices.  A significant portion was devoted to an on-air meeting rife with Anthony's angry and offensive outbursts about his computer problems and his superiors, Terrence Car and Eric Logan.  The meeting covered upcoming guests (Jamie Kennedy, Sandy Kane, Crash from Toucher and Rich, possibly Imus), Arbitron ratings, a gas station promotion, voiceover work, show bumpers, a Las Vegas trip, securing exotic cars through the Vulcan Motor Club, booking a terrorism author, and potential UFC fighter interviews.  Nina Savari was mentioned as a potential future guest.  The entire broadcast was characterized by highly informal, irreverent, and frequently profane and offensive humor.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screwed!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial Radio Personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Do you play a prostitute, bipolar?  I do.  Fantastic.  Jimmy's in love.  Wonderful.  Both qualities I look for when I meet someone.  We are sick.  Freaks.  Chris Benoit.  Oh boy.  It's so rare.  I leaned on the machine by accident and it hit a button. 
[00:01:00]  This is where entertainment is going.  How fast did you get it up to?  180 miles an hour.  What's the matter with you, idiot?  Cut the s***.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  The show starts with a threat from Anthony Cumia. 
[00:01:30]  A threat.  What is your threat?  Well, my threat is, you know, just things work in the corporate world.  You don't get crap done.  And my computer has been screwed here for weeks.  Just weeks.  I only ask for one stupid thing in here.  A computer that works.  I need to be online here.  I need little comments from Steve and everyone else.  Half the stuff that comes out of my mouth ain't my stuff. 
[00:02:00]  I need to see all the beautiful girls.  Beautiful girls.  On Pal Talk.  That's right.  And Steve got involved.  He said, well, I can't send you any.  What were you saying, Steve?  I don't want to put words in your mouth.  I want to get all this.  Very accurate.  Dude, just put male parts.  Yeah, that's all I was going to say.  If I am no longer able to write bitchy emails down to D.C.  because I've written so many of them about issues like this that I get told to shut up.  Uh, so, uh, if I complain anymore about the technical problems, I get told to shut up and, uh, mind my business, basically. 
[00:02:30]  By who?  By who?  Uh, the heads of the departments in D.C. who manage all this stuff.  Well, is there a solution to Anthony's problems in the works?  Uh, because Anthony's got a threat.  I'm told that there is a solution, but how long it takes to actually implement these solutions is this nebulous number that keeps changing.  I don't know.  It's not a threat, by the way.  It's a promise.  Yeah, but if you...  That's what I say.  If you were a real man, you would just do it today. 
[00:03:00]  Just do it today.  I'm ready to.  You know why?  And I got to tell you.  Just do it today.  Do it.  Do it.  This covers a few areas.  Windows sucks.  And now insert the most heinous thing you could possibly suck on.  The Mac Mac Show?  Well...  Ned Banning!  Reverend Al.  Ned Banning.  Reverend Al's, uh...  Reverend Al.  The back of Reverend Al's pants after he's been arrested.  You know, that was a bit swampy. 
[00:03:30]  What's the threat, man?  What's the threat?  Here's the threat.  Because now I've restarted the computer.  And I'm looking at a logo, and it hasn't restarted.  The little mouse icon is now frozen.  If this computer...  I give them a week, if they're listening down there.  You have a week.  And not for this temporary, Marcelino comes here, puts in the admin password that I'm not  allowed to see, and fixes it for two hours.  Yeah, why are we allowed to see passwords anymore?  I don't get it! 
[00:04:00]  So here's the threat.  I give you a week to fix this completely and totally.  Actually, I want a new computer.  One that is just dedicated to me and what I need.  I need PalTalk, and I need Explorer on it.  Period.  I don't need 80,000 other stupid programs running on this effing computer.  Because that's why it doesn't work.  Okay.  Now it's sitting there with the stupid XM logo, and I can't do crap with it.  I tried to restart it, and that's what happens.  You try to end the program.  You want to end program? 
[00:04:30]  End program.  Papa won't end.  Just sits there, taunting you.  It tasks me.  It tasks me.  So what's the threat?  So here's my threat.  If it's not done in a week.  Not done in a week.  Yeah.  I am opening up the little console.  That's where it resides, right?  The tower?  Mm-hmm.  Right under there, because I've seen people go under there many times to try to fix this stupid thing.  I will physically, without detaching one wire, rip the entire tower out and smash it like a baboon. 
[00:05:00]  I will smash the thing on any hard surface.  The table over there, the walls.  Will ya?  Everything.  Dude, I will smash the crap out of this thing.  Do it now.  No, that's why I'm giving ample warning.  Yeah, but...  I'm using a bit of diplomacy.  You've been doing...  I'm like the UN.  I have to go through certain channels.  I've got to call you out on this, because he's been...  No, you're gunboat diplomacy.  You're the guy that you would absolutely just do it immediately. 
[00:05:30]  I like to sit there and give him a little time.  How many times has Mars been in here trying to fix this problem over the last three or four months?  It's over, Johnny.  It's time for action.  I say the action is right now.  That's why I...  Let's go.  I'm going through all the proper...  Let's get arrested, everyone.  Follow me.  Where are you going?  Are you stopping the city?  Is this a day of outrage?  Absolutely.  If Anthony doesn't get his computer fixed, we should shut down the city.  Could you powerboot this stupid thing right now?  I tried to do it here, but Paris, I thought you hit restart. 
[00:06:00]  Why would it restart?  By the way...  It's Windows.  It will not be fixed within a week, because no one...  Your threats are idle.  Your threats are very...  Idle threat?  Yes.  You need to do something now, my friend.  Remember back in the day, we bitched and complained about the phones, because stupid  NEW, all they did was take requests for twofers and stuff, and we needed a real phone system  to interact with our listeners, and we gave them about a week or so, and they still wouldn't  listen to our plight? 
[00:06:30]  Uh-huh.  So what did we do?  We ripped it right out of the wall and smashed it.  Guess what?  We had a brand new phone system the next day.  I say you smash it now, Anthony.  I, no, I gotta give them a week.  I'm, I'm, I'm giving, I'm gonna put sanctions against them, and...  A week?  This is...  How about by tomorrow, at least?  This is diplomacy backed up with action.  Okay, tomorrow.  You have till tomorrow to fix it.  Tomorrow?  I've cut down the schedule.  Oh, I like that.  You have till tomorrow. 
[00:07:00]  The, the laptop thing never works, Danny.  I, I appreciate it, but...  Why does...  Oh, what, will it go to this monitor?  Why does the laptop thing don't work?  Because it's too small, you like, you're squinting.  Because they've tried that solution before, too, right?  See, you see?  And there's no room.  They're messing with ya.  They're messing with ya.  They, they task you.  They task me.  It's rebooting.  So we'll see what happens after that.  We'll see if it comes back.  Why does it reboot so slow?  Because it's Windows.  Windows eats it.  Thank you. 
[00:07:30]  Iraq just brought in a big hammer.  I will, I will just gut that computer.  I will gut it.  Let me just tap it for ya.  You want a little tap it?  Make sure it works?  Ow.  Give it a little tap.  How about we fix the static electricity in here, too, while we're at it?  That's right.  Otherwise, we're burning down the studio.  It's great.  It's like working with Tesla in here.  It's on that side.  Tesla joke?  No, that's a good one.  No, that's a good one.  I hope he just wants to take a hammer to something.  Yes, he does.  I'd rather give a hammer to that Samsonite luggage chimp. 
[00:08:00]  A little tap might help.  Okay, here we go.  Well, it's...  Watch it work.  All right, try it now.  It's in the midst of a reboot.  It's going to work.  Which, of course, because it's Windows, takes forever.  You ever turn on your Mac?  It's like, hit the button.  Hey, it's on.  I could work.  I could use it.  You ever go to turn off your Mac?  It's like, hey, it's off.  Yeah, all the time I would waste just waiting for Windows. 
[00:08:30]  I don't know why that takes so long.  Donk!  Donk!  Like when you're trying to do something and the window won't...  Donk!  Donk!  Donk!  You're hitting the little X.  You're trying to X out a window and it just isn't going anywhere.  Yeah, it's enraging.  And then the little, do you want to report this?  To who?  Where are those reports going?  There'd be eight billion stacks of reports that some idiot's got to file through.  Let's see.  Anthony in New York.  Hmm.  Oh, he reported this.  Yeah.  Seems to have a problem.  Hey, while we're talking bad about XM Satellite Radio, and I do blame the merger because 
[00:09:00]  all business has stopped for the last 14 or 15 months, we do have a PR department down  there.  It's really racist.  Yeah.  Could someone down there...  Hispanic department or something.  Could someone down there set David Hinckley straight here in New York City, please, from  the Daily News, please.  We're getting caught.  It worked, right?  I think I'm on.  Hammer time!  Hammer time!  Hammer time!  Hammer time!  Hammer time!  Woo! 
[00:09:30]  Oh, well, no, it's working now.  Oh.  Don't hammer it anymore.  Hammer time!  Don't need it.  Listen to me, please.  This David Hinckley, he writes about radio in New York, and he's pretty much clueless.  And he decided to do that whole Arbitron ratings for satellite radio bit, that everybody in  satellite radio knows that those ratings are complete BS.  Why doesn't XM do the right thing and get on the horn with David Hinckley and explain  why those ratings are not accurate to what is going on in the satellite radio world, please? 
[00:10:00]  Because we're getting horrible press because it doesn't look good.  It says we have 171,000 listeners on satellite, and that's just not true.  XM has a huge research department, and it's drastically different than what Hinckley's printing  in the paper here in New York.  You son of a bitch.  So how about someone down there at XM does the right thing and helps us out and at least  gives this guy knowledge?  Yes.  Please.  Phone number, 877-212-ON-A. 
[00:10:30]  Jesus.  Your computer's booted and ready to go.  I think so.  Until it just goes dark.  Yeah.  And that'll be it.  I turned on the instant feedback, and this was waiting for us.  Let me see where it is now.  No, it went by too fast.  Someone is saying that we were very paranoid yesterday.  Paranoid?  We were showing our whiteness yesterday.  What?  Some guy from Long Island.  Shut up.  We were at work.  Because we were panicky peats about the Reverend Al thing yesterday. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, well, he's making threats of closing the city down.  I fled the city.  Yeah.  I fled.  Like the Cloverfield monster was out there.  I was out.  Ootenzy.  It didn't look Martin Luther King-ish yesterday.  No.  That's for sure.  No.  A lot of people want to be the next Martin Luther King, and they just don't have what it takes.  No.  The great Martin Luther King.  I'll give him the great title. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, wow.  I also gave Drew Boogie that title, so don't look too much into that.  Not much.  Yeah, not much to it.  Oh, here it is.  You guys sounded pretty.  Oh, now it had an update.  Well, that's good.  That means people are listening to the show.  You guys sounded pretty white, panicky this morning, meaning yesterday.  10,000 of them, huh?  Your Long Island is showing.  You'll probably say I'm not a real fan, so go F yourselves.  Good luck, bro.  No, I mean, you know, we have fans that disagree with us.  That's fine.  But we completely disagree with what Reverend Al is doing. 
[00:12:00]  I'd rather be prepared.  Was he addressing the fact that no one was going to show up?  Yeah, that it didn't really pan out into the race war that, you know.  Because they said hundreds of people, but it was nothing like the massive...  Well, you know what it is, too.  The police in this city really know how to handle problems.  They know how to handle protests, demonstrations, parties, whatever.  They know how to do it.  They're organized and, for the most part, pretty respectful of protesters. 
[00:12:30]  You know.  They can only get a black guy out of the car without shooting him.  They'll be fine.  They handle all this stuff well.  Look.  How about that?  When it comes down to protests and stuff, you kind of know what you're getting yourself into.  It's not like a stop at a bar after some kind of drug investigation and allegations that a gun was there, 
[00:13:00]  a car lunging at people.  A little different than just, hey, we want to sit here and get arrested with some zip strips.  But the NYPD is very good at that.  Very good at keeping things under control.  And they left their riot gear home yesterday.  I noticed that.  Yeah, because that kind of makes an impression.  It kind of looks hostile.  Back in the day, the NYPD would look like pretty much Darth Vader.  Stormtroopers.  Yeah.  When stuff was going down.  But yesterday, they left all that at home.  It was very peaceful.  But very weird.  I'm reading a lot of articles on this. 
[00:13:30]  It's very polite.  And there was a police woman who went along the edge of the roadway because these people were getting into traffic to stop some of the main routes in and out of the city.  Excuse me.  And this police woman went along the edge of the roadway where a lot of the protesters were, and she was asking this.  Are you getting arrested?  She asked in a helpful tone.  If you're getting arrested, you should go over there.  And then a man said, oh, thank you.  It's a polite, very polite arrest. 
[00:14:00]  I don't know, man.  I've read a little bit on Martin Luther King.  Civil disobedience.  I don't picture, like, being that polite.  I understand that it's not like people aren't wilding and all that.  It's not like the old days, but I do believe I heard that one person did have a Bichon Frizzet sicked after him.  Oh, ho, ho.  What?  Is that a dog?  I have confidence in that.  A Bichon Bichon?  A Bichon Frizzet.  Maybe I should have said a Yorkshire Terrier.  Dog.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, but that's different. 
[00:14:30]  See, in the old days, it would have been German shepherds frothing at the mouth.  You went with a wimpy dog.  It's a wimpy dog.  All right, I got you.  Holy Jesus Christ.  Maybe I should get my dog.  That's funny.  My dog reference is a little better.  I just couldn't.  How about Dexter?  Yeah.  Would that have worked?  You picked the name.  A sick little Dexter after him.  You picked the name of a dog that maybe five people know out there.  Everyone knows a Bichon.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know what that is.  It's a friggin' glorified poodle.  Is it a French poodle?  Because my sister used to have one. 
[00:15:00]  So what happens to Reverend Allen now?  Is there consequences for attempting to shut down New York City?  I hear he gets 25 to life for this.  Or he's out already.  You know, Imus said three words and there were consequences.  So what's Reverend Allen's consequences for shutting down or trying to shut down New York City?  What are the consequences?  Yeah.  You can't just attempt to shut down.  Consequences schmonsequences.  You can't just attempt to shut down New York City, get arrested, which is who gives a crap.  He'll be out in a day if he's not out already. 
[00:15:30]  He's out already.  They get out immediately.  And I hear the governor of New York, Governor Patterson, is going to humor this idiot and meet with them.  Did they even take them down?  Because I saw them, like, processing them on the spot.  They probably didn't even go downtown.  It's kind of a weird thing.  They were taking Polaroid mug shots right there on site.  They'd handcuff them.  I knew they were putting them in a bus and a truck.  So I don't know if they were transporting them somewhere.  I guess probably to get the paperwork done.  But it's not an arrest like the billy clubs are coming out. 
[00:16:00]  You're getting your head smashed in a little bit.  You know, that's a true sacrifice for the cause.  These days, it's just very polite.  You're not making that much of an impact or a statement or anything.  This truly isn't going to change anything.  As far as awareness goes, it hasn't changed a thing.  It just doesn't work like this anymore.  You can't take civil disobedience and make it very civilized and obedient. 
[00:16:30]  This is civilized obedience is what it is.  They handed out pamphlets to the protesters.  Yeah, on what to do.  Everything they need to know to get arrested.  How to get arrested pamphlet.  I think Martin Luther King just did it and was like, ah, we'll figure this out as we go along.  People got their heads smashed in.  They didn't have pamphlets and over-the-top politeness.  Now it's just this thing that it's become a thing that is commonplace. 
[00:17:00]  It's so non-threatening to either side that it doesn't make that impact.  You need some kind of drama going on there for people to look and go, wow, these people are really making a sacrifice for a cause.  I have an idea.  The NYPD yesterday should have announced that yesterday was Old Timers Day.  Wait, like the ball games?  Yeah.  It's Old Timers Day on the NYPD, and they bring in some of the old guys.  Oh, yeah.  I remember the days. 
[00:17:30]  They know how to get the job done.  Coincidentally, the NYPD announces Old Timers Day.  Old Timers Day.  Throwback Jersey Day.  And, wow, look at who they brought in.  Officer O'Brien.  Boy, was he a good one back in his day.  Here he is bringing out the original Billy Club he used.  Here he is throwing around words like boy.  It's just old-timers day.  Old-timers day at the NYPD.  And they bring out their old equipment and everything.  Their old uniforms and equipment. 
[00:18:00]  I'm talking about the old equipment, huh?  Some of the stuff that's illegal now.  Where you can smash someone across the bridge of the nose with a six-shooter.  New York City phone book, 1973.  Yeah, big, thick phone book to just hit the abdomen with so you don't leave any marks.  Good news, everyone.  Reverend Al is having a press conference at 10.30 this morning.  How could he do that from prison?  To announce the next shutdown event.  What?  Imus got fired.  There were consequences for three lousy words.  What are the consequences for Reverend Al? 
[00:18:30]  I'm shutting down my career is what I'm doing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Jerk.  And people were affected by Reverend Al's actions yesterday.  Yes.  Just like Reverend Al said, people were affected by Imus' words and actions.  You know what?  You're right.  I was home in bed a lot earlier than I would have been.  So I was severely affected by yesterday's events.  And I was in the cab and I heard that that was happening.  Yeah.  On the news. 
[00:19:00]  Outraged.  Outraged.  You think?  I watched last yesterday when it was all going down.  And I don't know.  I think this is human nature.  I really do.  I don't think it's just me personally anymore.  I used to.  So, weren't you hoping for a little more action when you were watching the coverage?  Everyone does.  It's not just me, right?  No.  And then when I saw, ah, it's very, very civil.  Very subdued, yeah.  Subdued.  Not as many people.  I was like, ah, this kind of sucks.  This is what was supposed to entertain me this afternoon. 
[00:19:30]  We want action movies as humans.  In our reality, we want an action movie.  Right.  So when something happens and the press kind of leads up to it with, hey, there's going to  be this March, the cops are ready, here it is.  You're waiting for something.  And then when nothing happens, you're disappointed.  Like, that was a bad movie.  Yeah.  I didn't like that civil disobedience movie that Reverend Al made yesterday.  It was boring.  But the Cyclone movie's very interesting.  Oh, yeah.  Now they're saying 100,000 people dead.  At first they said a couple thousand, then they said tens of thousands. 
[00:20:00]  Now they're up to 100,000 people.  It really makes you look at this country and go like, we kind of do have our crap together.  But now, anyway, I think we're quickly turning into a third world nation.  You've got to thank the Vikings that came before us.  They knew that this part of the world was a very safe place to kind of put roots down.  We do have our tornadoes and our hurricanes and our earthquakes. 
[00:20:30]  That's why these other places will never be on the same level as us.  Because every, whatever, 40, 50 years, some ridiculous disaster happens, wiping out all  the progress they made.  Yeah.  And they have to start over.  Start all over again.  Tsunamis and cyclones and crazy earthquakes.  Cyclone.  Yeah, we've gotten to the point where we kind of know how to handle these things.  Vikings saw the map and said, that's where we need to go. 
[00:21:00]  The weather's pretty good over there.  Eh, not too bad.  And we could really develop a civilization that's going to go places.  Don't build mud houses when you got cyclones.  You have to.  You're going to invest in a really nice condo, knowing that, you know, at any moment, a cyclone  or a tsunami's coming your way.  I think the government's pretty much involved in why nothing's happening over there.  That goes right back into my theory.  The reason they couldn't get a government up and some real wealth is because every once  in a while, everything is getting completely destroyed. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Boy, they took a beat.  Yeah.  Something like 45,000 people are missing, too.  Oh, really?  Which me and Tham were kind of speculating they're not all hanging out together.  No.  That would be easy to find, 45,000 people they're strewn about.  I know.  It's weird how the media plays it safe.  45,000 people are missing.  It's not like they got a bump on the head and there's just 45,000 of them are just wandering  around trying to figure things out.  And could you, like, we truly are separatists in this world. 
[00:22:00]  We really are.  It doesn't matter who you are.  They announce that 100,000 human beings are dead because of a storm.  And we kind of look and go, wow, you look at the video clips, you're like, oh, that sucks.  Picture 100,000 dead in America for whatever circumstance it was.  Natural disaster, terrorism.  This would be unheard of. 
[00:22:30]  There would be grief, days of mourning.  The story would go on forever.  But because they're from a different border, because, you know, they're not from our land.  Because they don't have high staff.  Quite frankly, yeah.  It doesn't matter as much to us as Americans when people from other countries perish in giant numbers.  And the only reason that is is because we are very separate people.  We don't look at ourselves as humans and all equal and we care about this. 
[00:23:00]  We care about Americans.  That's all.  Why does the rest of the world hate us?  Why?  But I think it's the same in other parts of the world, too.  I think when 9-11 happened, you know, we have 4,000 or 5,000 people getting killed.  And I think the rest of the world was just like, eh, all right.  I'll watch the video.  We, yeah, but then we made the rest of the world pay attention to our...  Well, we have to bomb things. 
[00:23:30]  Our grief.  Yeah.  We grieve with bombs.  That's how America grieves.  Big heavy teardrops.  That's right.  Falling from B-52s.  Yeah.  All right, just getting warmed up.  Your computer's rebooted.  Yes.  The hammer worked, which is amazing to me.  I was really hoping it wouldn't so that we could go further and really smash the damn thing.  So, phone number 877-212-ON-A.  Later this morning, Hillary Clinton is going to announce that she is going to be a third-party candidate 
[00:24:00]  for the presidency of the United States of America.  That is why she refuses to drop out of this race.  Hopefully more on that as the morning goes on.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, how you doing?  What's up?  What's going on?  How are you?  This is Bill Burr.  I'm going to be at Zany's Comedy Club in Chicago, Illinois, May 14th through the 16th. 
[00:24:30]  You can go to Zany's.com.  And, ah, shit.  Where the hell am I?  Mount Vernon?  Oh, there it is.  Right there.  Yeah.  I'm going to be at Zany's in Vernon Hills, May 17th.  If you want more information, go to www.Zany'sVernonHills.com.  For the weekend, I just can't wait.  For the weekend, I just can't wait. 
[00:25:00]  Let's go.  Opie and Anthony.  Lil' Jimmy Norton.  Instant feedback.  Lots of it coming in today.  Mendoza the Jew.  How are you, sir?  I know you listen a lot.  He's not happy with us this morning, Anthony.  Why?  Well, we're talking about the fact that 100,000 people are dead because of that cyclone in  that, is it a country that I've never heard of?  It used to be Burma.  Remember Burma?  Sure.  Burmese people fighting tigers. 
[00:25:30]  Gotcha.  Yeah.  Mendoza the Jew from Jersey writes, do you have any idea how much money the U.S. government  and U.S. charities will dole out to this country in monetary aid and how much we did for the  tsunami?  Yet we don't care, according to you, and the this is why the world hates us line again.  And then he continues, we give more money and aid than anyone else on this SE planet.  Yep.  Including Afghanistan prior to 9-11.  And the world doesn't hate us for our freedom, but they certainly don't hate us for this trite 
[00:26:00]  nonsense that you guys claim either.  Hey, jerk ass, you completely missed my point.  Congratulations.  Another douche who is listening but completely misses the point I was making.  I wasn't talking about humanitarian aid.  We send humanitarian aid everywhere.  Whenever there's a problem on this globe, I know money goes out. 
[00:26:30]  I'm talking about human beings looking at a situation where 100,000 other human beings  are dead and not caring, not giving a crap about it.  You watch it on the news.  Are you busting up into tears?  Jerk ass.  What's your name?  Who is he?  Mendoza the Jew.  Mendoza the Jew.  Did you sit there and watch the footage and openly weep about these people and mourn them? 
[00:27:00]  Are you taking days off to mourn them because 100,000 fellow human beings on this planet are  dead?  I'm not talking about shelling out cash.  We do that all the time.  I'm talking about on a personal level, did you give a flying F that 100,000 fellow human  beings are dead on this planet?  No.  That's what I'm saying.  Not that we give.  What do you think, I'm stupid?  I don't think we give out tons of money whenever there's a disaster?  Of course, it's our planes flying over there.  Red Cross dropping supplies. 
[00:27:30]  Our soldiers doling out water to people.  God, listen for a second, you douche.  I can't stand when they don't listen.  Very, very good.  I think we just throw money at some of these situations just to make ourselves feel better,  by the way.  Yeah, that's another thing.  Because I think we have a lot of guilt being Americans in general because we know how wealthy  this country is.  Yeah.  And the amount of money that we do throw at some of these situations are mere pennies. 
[00:28:00]  And worldwide politics, it looks great politically in the world eye for us as the United States  to hand over money when there's a huge disaster like this.  It's not an individual thing, though, that we sit there and start weeping and reaching  into our pockets.  You dummy.  Thank you.  I want to address something, if I could.  Oh, Jimmy.  Certainly, James.  Jim Norton.  Hi.  How are you?  What's up?  Gang, I'm good.  Good to see you.  You too. 
[00:28:30]  I was E-Rock informed me that here at 923 K-Rock in New York, Judas Priest, three of the  guys, Rob Halford and I think KK, who are the other, and three of the guys came in.  After Rob Halford, I don't know anybody else in Judas Priest.  Yeah, he's the big one, but the other two guys came in with him.  Yep.  What?  What is his note?  He just threw Jimmy a note and he's like, what?  Okay, it was just small.  But anyway, Rob was being interviewed by the afternoon guy here.  Ian?  Ian, yeah, he was great. 
[00:29:00]  I hear he's cool, man.  Yeah, he's really cool.  Ian's a good guy.  I was actually talking to Halford about Sabbath.  It was a great time chatting with those guys.  They came in, did a great interview with Ian.  And I was standing back there talking to Danny, who I'd not met before.  And Mike, the music guy from here, who's very nice.  Mike is awesome.  I found myself very attracted to Danny, who works here.  She's very, very lovely.  Oh, she?  Yeah.  No, no, no, not a Y.  I thought you meant Danny from our show.  No, not at all.  Yeah, I was like, what the hell's going on?  Danny has a great ass, but...  Yeah, he's very kissable. 
[00:29:30]  Not even in a gay way, but I've said to Danny, like, your mouth looks like it would  be nice just to suck on the lower lip.  But she was really sexy.  I mean, really sexy.  So I'm rapping with it for a while.  And she had, like, a nice energy.  So I left, and I'm on my way home, and I'm on the subway.  And I was standing next to somebody.  Some guy brought his bike on, and he stunk so bad.  It was horrendous.  And I kept looking around. 
[00:30:00]  And then I got home, and I took off my shirt, and I realized that I had horrendous underarm odor.  Oh, no, it was you?  It was me.  I was so...  You were a smelly guy on the train?  I reeked yesterday.  And I know why, because you were meeting Rob Halford.  That made you very nervous.  And you were also talking to a pretty girl.  That also probably made you a little nervous.  I had you sweating.  My armpits just, like, released whatever toxins were in my body.  I very rarely smell like that. 
[00:30:30]  But I was really embarrassed, because I was standing next to her talking to her for a good 10 minutes.  And there's no way she couldn't have smelled.  I stunk so goddamn bad yesterday.  But sometimes that's a turn-on to the women.  Yeah, that's why she laughs.  The natural body odor.  Sometimes that's a turn-on.  There's a difference between a natural, subtle smell of somebody and just complete B.O.  Yeah, this wasn't musky man, his son of a day's work.  With a little Abercrombie and Fitch thrown in. 
[00:31:00]  This is a scared, smelly little guy.  Yeah, this was nervous blubber breast meets idol.  Oh, yee me.  Dude, I just reeked.  I was so embarrassed when I got home.  Did you wash up real quick, hop in the shower?  No, no.  I just rubbed it and rubbed it under my nose to teach myself a lesson.  I'm like a dog who poofs on the rug.  Yeah, I hopped right in the...  Hits yourself with a newspaper?  I was sickeningly odoriferous.  Wow.  So my apologies to Danny. 
[00:31:30]  You usually are never offensive walking around here.  No, no, no.  I try not to be.  I couldn't believe how bad it was.  I'm like, oh my God, I was the guy on the train.  It's on the train, too.  Somebody telling that story, though, that when they got home, it's like, oh, how was your trip?  How was your day?  I was all right.  Then, oh, yeah, I was on the train.  And, oh, this guy stunk.  I saw him on HBO, too, so I know who he is.  He stunk there.  It was like his acting was being personified somehow. 
[00:32:00]  He was oozing from his armpits.  But it's like, you know how bad you have to smell to smell yourself on a subway?  And not know it's you?  Yeah.  I mean, like...  Wow.  I was looking around, like, who is this?  Oh, my God.  I'm right already.  It was annoying.  Well, for all the gas you had yesterday, perhaps that was oozing up your shirt and clinging  to the little wisps of hair on your underarms.  Did you shower before you came back to the station?  Did you go home and shower?  No.  Oh, because you had really bad farts yesterday, Jimmy, too. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, that might have, like, clinged to certain areas of your body.  A shower wouldn't help.  I don't shower in headstand mode.  Well, you've got to get the undercarriage.  Yeah, you've got to do a little...  You've got to put on that true coat.  Sure.  Sure.  Let's say hi to Nick in Pennsylvania.  Nick, what's up?  Hey.  Love you.  Love the show.  Jimmy, don't worry about it.  You're a fancy man, and you're funny, and you're rich.  Well, I'm not rich, but thank you, sir.  I'm doing okay, but I stunk. 
[00:33:00]  All that stuff is nice.  I'm a fancy gentleman, and I do enjoy gentlemanly things.  I'll agree with you and so on, anyone else who knows me.  But the reek coming out of my pits was inexcusable.  Like, you don't wipe your armpits.  Like, you just wipe your raw pit, and it's soaking wet, and it's a raw pit odor.  The worst thing is, if you're in that situation, and you know you can't get home and wash up really quickly, you're compelled to keep your arms down so it's not like spreading around, which only compounds the problem. 
[00:33:30]  Makes it worse.  I don't mind my own pit odor.  Like, if I know it's mine, I'll just enjoy it.  But if you're in public...  It was...  Horrendous.  It really was bad.  I do shower a lot and change a lot, which gets Keith very angry, because I use up a lot of clothing that he has to do the laundry of.  Yeah, I know.  We went over that the other day.  Yeah, I'm just saying.  No, no, I just like being clean.  Yeah.  I don't like, you know...  What are you trying to wash away? 
[00:34:00]  Let's get into this a little bit.  Yeah, that's true.  Hurt, pain, sadness.  If you're taking more than...  Well, more than...  Some days you have to take two showers if you're going to the gym.  Booze that's sweating out of me.  But if you're taking two or three showers regularly, every day, you're trying to scrub something away.  You know that, right?  No.  I would take probably two a day.  Usually just one, but sometimes two.  If I'm going out somewhere, you know...  Oh, that's normal.  I get a shower and change into new clothes. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like if I'm going out to the living room.  Put your best gun on.  Yeah.  Pick my little gun.  Which one today?  Sprinkly your canoe cologne.  Today, my inner lip is shedding.  Ew.  It's shedding?  Yeah, you know how you get...  Don't screw with it.  You are a pick, pick, picky guy.  No, this is the normal, like, skin gook that builds up in your... 
[00:35:00]  No!  You're supposed to just chew it with your tooth, you go like this, you go like this, and then  you chew a little with your front teeth, you nibble, you nibble.  No, I'm not even picking.  This is like, it's pretty much skin film, and one little...  And you can get rid of all of it.  Ow.  It sounds painful, but I know.  No, it's kind of like...  I've been there.  It's kind of floating on the surface.  Hey, this is from yesterday.  We had another home invasion.  Oh, boy.  This drives Anthony nuts.  This one is really interesting.  Let's get right into the story.  Around 3.30 this morning, I come from jogging, and a stranger appears from the stairs, and 
[00:35:30]  he comes from behind me.  Problem number one.  Why are you jogging at 3.30?  It's 3.30 in the morning, and he's coming back from jogging?  I'm a big fan of that working out thing.  Yeah.  3.30 in the morning is no time to be exercising, ever.  Jogging to your drug dealer.  Right.  Yeah.  Maybe this guy's coming up with an excuse why he was out and about at 3.30 in the morning.  Because there's not many people jogging at 3.30 in the morning. 
[00:36:00]  And he comes from behind me, and he puts a gun to the back of my head.  Oh, boy.  He's like, get inside of your house.  Javon Maxime describes what happened to him after an early morning jog in Crown Heights.  He found himself with a gun to his head after being pushed into his apartment by an assailant.  Who immediately started robbing his apartment.  Takes my stereo and my skinny DVD player.  And then he ties me up to this radiator over here.  And then he ties me up to this radiator over here.  Oh, my God. 
[00:36:30]  See, that's somebody who, if there's no shenanigans involved, if this is actually how it happened.  Yeah.  There's somebody not paying attention to his surroundings.  Of course.  At 3.30 in the morning.  If you're at the point where someone puts a gun to the back of your head, it's kind of too late.  Now you're really in danger, even if you are armed, of being shot in the head trying to defend yourself.  So at that point, you might have to just go along and see where this plays out. 
[00:37:00]  But you've got to constantly be aware of your surroundings so that somebody can't come up behind you and put a gun to your head.  If you're walking around at 3.30 in the morning, you've got to walk around like a video game character.  Just looking around.  Yes, constantly spinning around and looking around.  You don't know where the threat's coming from.  Just think video game character.  Video game character.  Crouching.  Crouching.  Getting up.  Yes.  Yeah.  Maybe ducking into a doorway and seeing if anybody passes you by.  Crouch, look out the side of the doorway.  Of course.  Yeah, you really got to watch out what you're doing. 
[00:37:30]  The bandit, dressed in all black with a hood, made his way down the fire escape to the apartment of Anthony Prescott, where the robber let another man in.  And then robbed my apartment, my mom, and my girlfriend, and that's what happened, basically, and tied us up.  What'd they say?  What'd they do?  Well, the first person they assaulted was my mom.  She was sleeping in the living room.  Yeah, so then they moved on to the next apartment, these home invaders. 
[00:38:00]  Wow.  They're just taking up the whole line of apartments?  Yeah, and then this is the reason we're playing this today.  Listen to this clip.  Residents here are scared, especially because the main door key is shared by dozens of buildings in the neighborhood, adjacent to the Brooklyn Botanical Garden.  The key that fits into this building fits into 56 other buildings in this neighborhood.  So you'll do the math.  Good to get that info out there.  That doesn't make a lot of sense.  One key opens up 56 buildings in that area.  That's nice.  That's wonderful. 
[00:38:30]  Just asking for a little bit of trouble.  Who's the locksmith?  The lazy locksmith.  The lazy locksmith.  Yeah, this is good enough.  Ah, here, here.  I'm getting caught.  Yeah.  I will just change the key colors.  That's all.  That's creepy.  What happens if you refuse to go into the apartment?  Like, if you don't resist, but if you just sit on the stairs and, I mean, is the guy, you know, will he shoot you, but that's so loud?  I think you get beat first.  You get that friggin' crack over the nose.  You say, I'm not going into the apartment.  You're going to have to shoot me here.  Like, not to be brazen, but, like, I'm afraid, they always say if you go to a second location, but then again, this guy lived in, he's fine. 
[00:39:00]  So, they say, like, especially if you're a woman and a guy wants to drag you into a car, never go.  Never go.  He's taking you somewhere.  He'll hurt you quietly.  Yeah.  Or safely.  Yeah, he's not happy with the current location, obviously.  They usually do resist, though, but, you know, the guys overpower and throw him in the car.  It's pretty friggin' sick when you see some of those surveillance tapes.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  If you're a guy, though, you know, fight it out right there.  Let's go to Robert in Dallas, Texas. 
[00:39:30]  Robert.  Hey, boys, who did Tracy Morgan got mugged?  Time into the radiator right there.  It was hilarious.  Yeah, a little bit, a little bit.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Dan in the Poconos.  Dan.  Hey, boys, what's up?  Are you calling from a heart-shaped tub?  I am calling from a champagne tower.  The Poconos.  He knows the champagne tower.  Ah, the champagne tower.  He's been there.  He knows the lingo.  Yeah.  Are you in the Caesar room? 
[00:40:00]  Only the best for sweetie, right?  You know it.  That shag carpet that isn't quite as cushy and soft as it used to be.  Crunches like cornflakes when you walk on it.  What do you got, Dan?  Listen, you know, Ant's got to be really careful.  I don't know if you guys are paying attention, but he just nonchalantly popped in there that  he changes his clothes so often that it upsets Keith.  Who has to do the laundry.  Yeah, well, those people who don't linger longer, they don't know who Keith is.  It might as well be mentioning it's his partner. 
[00:40:30]  He sounds a little gay.  Oh, it sounds a little gay?  Yeah, I think every time that comes up, Ant, you've got to make it perfectly clear that  Keith is your hired friend.  Yeah.  You pretty much pay him to be your friend.  I have to pay for a good friend.  Yeah.  It doesn't sound any less gay.  Well, and Keith's married.  He's got a few kids.  Yeah.  But he does have his own room at Ant's Place.  He's got the Keith suite that he has.  It's on the other side of my house in the north wing of the house. 
[00:41:00]  And I'm all the way in the south wing.  All right.  There you go.  You explained it.  Yeah.  Phone number 877-212-O-N-A.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony's top song of the day.  Madonna with Justin Timberlake.  Four minutes.  Time is waiting.  You've only got four minutes to save the world.  No hesitating.  That's what I got you, girl.  Time is waiting. 
[00:41:30]  We only got four minutes to save the world.  No hesitating.  We only got four minutes.  Four minutes.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Wake up.  When does this kick in?  Right here.  Here it comes.  Girl.  No.  No.  One more time. 
[00:42:00]  Got to go around again.  Here it goes.  Now I kick in.  Girl.  No.  All right.  Coming around.  Jimmy.  When does this kick in?  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  Girl.  Come on.  It's kicking already.  Literally.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  877-212-ON-A.  Let's not forget about onaradio.com.  On the way later this hour.  Club Soda Kenny does his next or his latest phone slam for everybody. 
[00:42:30]  You know it's odd now when you say Club Soda Kenny does.  There's so many things to choose from.  Well, he's our morning zoo guy.  Yeah.  Because we're noticing that morning zoos do very well in the ratings.  So we got to do a little morning zoo stuff.  The little bits that the morning zoos do.  And they do their phony phone calls that are completely illegal.  So if you do hear one of these on a morning zoo, just realize that it's all set up in advance.  They're fake.  Because there's not a lawyer in radio today that will allow a show to do prank phone calls anymore. 
[00:43:00]  Be sued by everybody.  That's right.  And of course, also, like these news stations do very well in the ratings.  So Kenny also does like traffic and weather together on the 8s for everybody.  Probably my best.  My favorite.  He only does it like once every other day or two because, you know, we're trying to learn as we get older.  We don't want to like, you know, run these bits into the ground.  Speaking of Hack Radio, let's say good morning to Scorch.  Hi, Scorch.  How are you? 
[00:43:30]  Hey, guys.  How are you guys doing?  Good.  Scorch.  You got our attention again, Scorch.  You're becoming a, I don't know, a national celebrity.  Sensation.  Yeah, on our radio show because of what you're doing with your radio show.  Thanks, man.  I think no, absolutely.  And you're on what?  Rock 101.  Rock 101.  Afternoons.  Rock101fm.com.  Three to two to seven, actually.  Two to seven.  Very, very good.  Yep.  You know, so and the reason that I I'm here today, I think, is because of this dog thing. 
[00:44:00]  Is that right?  Yes.  Yes.  Now, now we heard about this, but we want some details.  Yep.  You know what?  I swear to God, man, I'm so sick and tired.  You know, seeing animal abuse stories, it just drives me crazy because that's my passion  is animals.  Is it?  Yeah, it's just one of those things.  So what I suggested to the station, I said, let me do something for animals.  Everybody always does charity things for people. 
[00:44:30]  Let me try to do something for animals.  And the best way I could do it, I figured, was to go live in a cage.  And they took me up on it.  So I will be living 24 hours a day in a Great Danes cage to raise money for the Animal Rescue  League.  Seriously.  What if you don't get it?  Like, what if by the end of the day you have like $40?  Are you going to say that you get $10,000?  That ain't going to happen.  Now, Scorch.  I'm not worried about that.  What?  Take some advice from your pals. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  The bit's a bit hacky.  Like, how are you going to make it edgy?  Are you going to live in that cage with a pit bull or something?  You got to like, you got to, you got to spin it.  You got to flip it.  You got to do something a little different than every other morning show.  Are you going to go to the bathroom in the cage or are they going to let you out for  breaks, things like that?  Look, I'm not going to, you know, I think it.  We're talking about stuff like that.  We're talking about, we're talking about perhaps having a giant litter box for me and,  you know.  A giant litter box.  Oh, my God.  Listen, Scorch.  I'm burying, burying. 
[00:45:30]  You're burying a little log.  You're doing a nice thing.  It doesn't have that.  You're, you're, you're helping out, uh, uh, uh, animals.  That's all good.  Charity's all good, but you need to do, you need to spin it.  Scorch, we, we expect more from you.  Nah, no spin on this one.  This is just a, this is just a nice, warm, fuzzy thing.  But people are going to walk by the cage and go, ah, wow.  And then what?  Yeah.  Where's the cage going to be?  Let them throw like dog, you know what at you as they walk by, like something different. 
[00:46:00]  There's no need for that.  Uh, the cage is going to be out front of the, uh,  Verizon Wireless.  Would you allow our listeners to maybe, uh, you know, throw yellow paint on you?  Like, we need to spin this for you.  Uh, no.  Now, so you're in the cage in, in a public place.  I'm in the cage.  It's right on the main street of, of, uh, Manchester.  Outside or indoors?  Outside.  So you're outside in a cage and, uh, people can come up and, and what? 
[00:46:30]  You'll just talk to them?  People are going to, there's going to be people from the animal rescue league there.  They're going to have, you know, a couple of pets every, every day.  Okay.  And how, how long do you have to spend in the cage every day?  I'm going to be in the cage.  Literally, I'll, I'll probably get out like, uh, five, 10 minutes, an hour, get out of the cage.  No, no, you can't do that.  That, that's hacky too.  You got to stay in there the whole time without any breaks.  Yeah, I would think you have to stay in there the whole time.  The whole getting out of the cage thing never works.  Why don't you guys come out and join me in the cage? 
[00:47:00]  No.  No.  Rather sit in coffin seats at a wrestling match.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a whole other issue.  Uh, so yeah.  So anyway, uh, if you go to rock101fm.com, if anybody listening is an animal lover, that agrees.  Yeah.  Not like the animal lover, like the horse guy.  Scorch, if it rains, are you, are you staying in the cage?  Oh, for Christ's sake.  Yes, it's going to be pouring out in my first two days of the cage, Monday and Tuesday.  And you're not going to have an umbrella over the cage or any of that crap, right?  As far as I'm going to live like a neglected pet to raise awareness for neglected pets. 
[00:47:30]  So why don't you like do kind of like a G.G. Allen and maybe, uh, maybe you'd put yourself  in it like a, a dog collar, completely nude, totally nude score.  Totally nude.  Totally nude.  I used to love G.G. Allen is from Manchester, New Hampshire.  He's a, uh, he was, uh.  He was an animal.  Simple as that.  Yeah.  His music was terrific.  It was wonderful.  Uh, so that's what I'll do.  I'll play G.G. Allen records.  Uh, Scorch, are you afraid of being euthanized while you're in the, uh, cage? 
[00:48:00]  You might think, well, Dave Douglas, you have a problem.  Dave Douglas did that to him years ago.  Oh.  No.  Uh, no, everything's cool.  I'm just, it's just, I just want to get in and get out and do what I got to do for  the animals.  I mean, you're doing a nice thing, but I really think you need to kind of spin it.  You need to bring a little edge to it somehow.  Well, I'll work on the edge for, for the, for the ONA listeners.  I will work on an edge for you guys.  All right.  If you come up with one, you call us back.  Okay. 
[00:48:30]  You got it, man.  All right.  There goes Scorch.  Uh, he's going to live in a dog cage and, uh, uh, whatever.  He's going to live in a dog cage and he's going to live in a dog cage.  I know it's, uh, it's one of those up on the billboard things.  Uh, when DJs do that for a while, uh, sitting in a seat, uh, I, I don't know.  It's, it's just DJs living in a truck until they fill it up with, you know, toys for tots  toys or food or food for, for the homeless for Thanksgiving.  And it's all outrageous because they're not leaving until the truck is filled. 
[00:49:00]  Wow.  Just throw locks on the cage when he's in there and then put it in water and just watch him  freak out and just lift it up a little so he could just barely suck some air in and then  dunk it again.  So the whole cage is completely submerged.  That would rock.  That would be cool to watch.  Yeah.  Drowning Scorch.  I have no problem with, uh, the raising of money and charities and all that, but you  gotta like, you gotta, you gotta flip it.  You gotta, you gotta like, you gotta throw a little edge in there.  He should show up in a fur coat. 
[00:49:30]  That'd be great.  Eating meat products.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Other shoes.  Hey, how you doing?  I love animals.  Like he should be, uh, he, he should be probably nude or, or almost nude.  Jeez.  He should probably have, he should probably smear something all over his, uh, nude body.  He should be in a, yeah.  He should be in a dog collar and they should make him like, uh, take his meals, you know,  in a, in a dog bowl and then, and, and not get out at all.  This whole, like, you know, leaving the surroundings for five or 10 minutes to stretch your legs. 
[00:50:00]  That, that doesn't do anyone.  You know, you know why he should be like an abused animal.  He should be locked in a cage with his own feces, uh, having to just eat old dog food.  That's been sitting there a while.  Right.  Not much water, dirty water, like water with bugs floating around in it.  Yeah.  And a collar that's too tight.  Mm-hmm.  Stuff like that.  Let's say hi to Jared in Boston, a regular to the Opie and Anthony show listening on BCN.  Jared, what's up? 
[00:50:30]  La, la, la, la, la.  Hey, Scorch, I have a question for you.  Hey, you did that pretty good, by the way.  Scorch is off the, uh, off the phone already there, Jared.  Ah, crap.  Well, I wanted to know, since he had his, uh, John McCain impression down so well, how's  he doing, Barack Obama?  Ow!  Ow!  Living in a little cage.  Yeah.  Yeah, very nice.  Very, very nice.  All right, moving on to other things.  So, uh, Jimmy, what do we got over there?  We got the, uh, that, uh, Austrian dad.  We got an update on him?  What a great dad this guy is. 
[00:51:00]  I told her this story would be a huge one.  Oh, yeah.  It's got legs.  It certainly does.  I've been in the basement trying to hear you.  Well, she can't get out.  He's kind of pissed off at the media, I was reading, because, uh, he said, look, I'm a  good guy.  I could have killed all these people.  Yeah.  That's what he said to the media.  I could have killed all these people.  I'm a good guy in the end here.  Just locked them away for 20 some odd years and raped them.  Right.  But he didn't kill them.  No.  That's his contention.  He's a good guy.  Look.  Didn't clip his eyebrows either, did he?  Look, I, yes, I raped my daughter for 24 years.  Yes, my, my grandchildren were kept, slash children kept. 
[00:51:30]  Never saw the sun.  Never saw the sun.  They didn't know what it was.  And I lived upstairs, and I lived downstairs.  No one knew nothing.  But, I didn't, it's a word of advice.  I'm not a lawyer.  But it's not a good way to get out of a crime by just mentioning worse things you could have  done.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, you're never going to have a speeding ticket by going, look, I'm not raping.  Good point.  All right, you're free to go.  Never works.  He looks like, um, he looks like, uh, the father from, uh, Arthur.  Hmm. 
[00:52:00]  Like, um, the chick.  Oh, Susan's father?  Susan's father, I think.  Susan?  Oh, Burt Johnson.  No, no, no.  Who am I thinking?  Maybe, uh, who does he look like?  Help me out here.  This is going nowhere.  I understand that.  The Austrian guy.  No, he looks like an actor, though.  The guy that played the man who raped his daughter for 23 years.  In that miniseries.  Miniseries.  Yes.  Called, uh, uh, Lightless Basement.  It's wonderful. 
[00:52:30]  A lifetime.  He, Rock, you got a job.  Who does he look like?  Help me out.  Oh, there he is.  Uh, Pat in Virginia.  What's up?  Oh, I know who he looks like.  Speaking of Pat, he looks like, uh, he looks like Big Enos from, uh, Smokey and the Bandit.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  There you go.  Because he's thirsty.  Dummy.  That was Paul Williams.  Yes.  Uh, Pat, Virginia.  What's up?  I think the only thing Scorch should do is put a shock collar on his ass, and every time  he talks, shock his ass.  Yeah, a little shock collar.  A shock collar would be good, and then people could come up, pay money, and then shock him. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  That's the bit.  Or if he's really big into the animals, they'll have himself neutered.  Cut them balls right off.  We know what neutered is, sir.  Yeah.  Thanks.  Let's go to Dave.  Dave, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, I've got Scorch's edge, man.  Yeah.  All he has to do is eat elbow the whole time, wet, greasy slop straight out of the can, and  only bathe with his own tongue.  I gotta tell you, you know, our own Pat Duffy would do this stunt very, very different. 
[00:53:30]  Yep.  He would...  There'd be danger involved.  He would smear all sorts of crap on him, on himself.  He would be, you know, almost nude.  He would have a collar on the whole time, and he wouldn't leave the cage.  Yeah.  And he would eat out of a dog, uh...  Doggy bowl.  A doggy bowl.  And he would eat dog food.  Yeah.  It's nice that Scorch is raising the money, but come on, Scorch.  You could do a little better than that.  John, New York, what's up?  Yeah, um, that Austrian guy?  Yeah.  He looks like the original Joker from Batman.  He's even got the raised eyebrow and everything. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, that actor.  Yeah, who played him?  Cesar Romero?  Cesar Romero.  Cesar Romero.  Thank you, sir.  I thought he looked like somebody.  Let's go to Joe and Jerry.  Oh, there's a photo of him with Dr. Ruth, his awful wife.  I actually can't blame him now when I see his wife.  No nothing, put the blinders on.  Yeah.  My husband's great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Going to the basement again for another eight hours to moan, are you?  All right.  I'll be up here making stew.  What an unobservant idiot.  Yeah.  God, oh my.  How does she not notice?  Unbelievable.  Yeah, he would just disappear down there, I guess. 
[00:54:30]  I'd be working downstairs.  Don't come down.  What are you working on?  Vroding's the life of my daughter and our children together.  Joe in Jersey.  Hey, good morning.  I hope I'm here to help you out.  The creepy guy looks like Vincent Price.  Yeah, a little Vincent Price, too, I'm thinking.  All right.  Yeah.  Very good, man.  Thank you.  All right.  Punch it out.  He looks like a bunch of older actors.  Or dead actors. 
[00:55:00]  He's just laughing as he's ruining a girl.  Yeah.  How good are we?  How good are we?  He has a movie out, I expect, a situation.  It's called The Pit and the...  I screwed up.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Jimmy, you did it.  Oh, Jimmy, what happened?  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  One flag.  One flag of fun, Jim.  I'm sorry.  No, that's all right. 
[00:55:30]  I'm sorry.  I was going to say about his wife in the basement.  Yeah.  And the movie was...  We know.  Yeah, right.  Please try it again.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah, go ahead.  Star slash.  Now batting.  And the movie was called The Pit and the Dum Dum.  Instead of Penn Jillian.  Wow.  Okay.  And here we go.  One flag.  You should have gave him two for trying again.  Two flags.  All right.  There you go.  Two flags of fun.  I'm so far from six, though.  Instead of Penn Jillian. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, well.  Tim, Pennsylvania has something.  Tim, what's up?  Oh, boy.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I just wanted to suggest perhaps the wacky dad looks like a Rip Taylor.  Yep.  Yeah.  Go on.  Oh, Rip Taylor.  Yeah.  Throwing confetti around, banging his daughter.  Bye-bye.  We better go into...  Oh.  A little flamboyant.  We better go into radio voice mode.  So, Bobby, New Jersey, do you have a celebrity that the incest father looks like?  Yeah, it is kind of turning into that, isn't it? 
[00:56:30]  We're going to do this for 10 minutes before we do our next traffic and weather break.  Yes, Bobby.  Hi, Bobby.  I just wanted to say he looks like Donald Sutherland from Backdrag.  He likes to burn everything.  Donald Sutherland.  Donald Sutherland.  He does indeed look a lot like Donald Sutherland.  What a great actor Donald Sutherland was.  You know, one of my favorite movies was when he was in Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  What a captivating movie.  But, yes, he does resemble Donald Sutherland. 
[00:57:00]  Hey, we're looking for your calls.  What celebrity does the Austrian daughter rapist look like?  Speaking of Body Snatchers, this guy has been invading some bodies.  Oh, come on.  That's too outrageous.  Oh, guys.  Now, she was very hurt.  Oh, shut up, hole.  We're men being men.  Will you shut the F up and go get me some coffee?  Jimmy, Jersey, what's up?  I'm nothing.  I got a name for what he looks like. 
[00:57:30]  He looks like Arthur Shawcroft.  Yeah, a little bit.  Yeah, Jimmy might be able to give you more details.  I think we all know who he is.  He was from the Rochester area, right?  That was the Rochester one?  Yeah.  I think he is the most notorious alive rapist.  I think so.  I don't know.  Shawcross has allegedly eight kids or something in Vietnam or in Asia or something.  Yeah.  No, Asian.  This guy looks like, he reminds me a little bit of Sutherland and JFK, too. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  Truth's on your side, Bubba.  You know, the creepy hat.  Yeah.  He sits there and spits out speculation, and Oliver Stone documented this fact.  Call me Mr. X.  All right.  All right.  We get it.  Is that your name, Mr. X?  All right.  How about call me?  Ten characters pushed into one thing that the director wanted to say.  We'll quit while I was ahead.  Yeah.  We'll do one more here.  Dan.  I want ten more.  These are wonderful.  Dan on Long Island.  What's up?  I think he looks like Fred Thompson.  We're just yelling things now.  Denzel Washington. 
[00:58:30]  Denzel.  Peter Sellers.  But now, if he was alive.  All right.  All right.  Get a hold of yourself.  Right.  He does look like a younger Vincent Price, though.  Look at that.  Younger Vincent Price.  Connie Francis.  Yeah.  He looks like Connie Francis.  Well, dad's got one.  He does also look like Wilford Brimley.  My daughter had the diabetes.  I'd lock her away.  Liberty testing supplies would deliver, go through the eight doors, and then I'd stick the needle  in her.  I'm not going to call you out.  You just wanted to do his voice today.  Diabetes.  He doesn't look anything like him. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, he does.  No, he does.  Kind of look at him.  Where's that picture?  All right.  Now, I got to see.  What's the picture of him and his wife?  Dan Long Island.  What's up, Dan?  A younger one.  Dan?  A little bit.  I was just like Salvador Dali.  All right.  Salvador Dali.  Now we got Salvador Dali.  That's a good one.  Yeah.  The famous artist.  Salvador Dali.  Yes.  Yeah.  You ever see the painting with the melting clocks?  Fascinating.  Fascinating.  Exactly.  Morning radio douche.  What?  Us? 
[00:59:30]  What?  Did you guys hear there was a swarm of bees on the Upper East Side on a newspaper vending  machine?  Very scary.  Yes.  It was quite the story yesterday here in New York.  Very scary, the bees.  Everybody was looking.  But I understand that they're very...  I've heard the swarms look very scary, but I've been told that they're not really threatening.  Oh, really?  They're kind of docile.  Oh, are they?  That's as long as they have their little queen bee there.  I think they're pretty cool as long as you don't screw with them. 
[01:00:00]  When they're not protecting a hive, they're okay.  Yeah.  But the second you start screwing around with them without puffing that stupid smoke in their  little bee faces, then there's problems.  Well, I'm saying that they're docile when they're swarming.  Not...  Look, they're over there.  You can scoop up handfuls and put them in your pocket and take them home as bee pets.  Put them in your pocket.  I didn't say that.  That'd rock.  They won't defend their lives.  I am petrified of bees.  Of bumblebees?  There's one...  Any type of bee.  If you want to know what one of my big fears are, one... 
[01:00:30]  Well, we all know what my number one fear is.  Right.  Part of the bumblebee.  They tend to swarm, too.  Can we make a list of things you're afraid of?  Because I got a few I just want to throw out there myself.  Really?  That you're afraid of?  Or that I am?  Yeah, you.  Okay.  Kids.  I'm afraid of...  Commitment.  Criminals.  What?  I'm afraid of criminals breaking into my house.  That's, like, the big one.  Bees.  I don't like bees.  I don't like N's.  I don't like...  J's. 
[01:01:00]  J's.  If we're just going through letters.  Bees scare the crap out of me.  And they always say, leave them alone and they won't hurt you.  That's crap.  I had a bee once land on my stomach when I was a kid.  Yeah.  And I remembered, just don't touch it and it won't do anything.  It'll fly away.  So I sat there looking at it, completely still, not touching it, and it jabbed its stinger  right into my gut.  Probably could feel your little nervous stomach.  You'd gotten scared.  Yeah, you got... 
[01:01:30]  I was scared, but what am I supposed to do?  You were perspiring.  I was a little kid.  So...  Bees stink.  Bumblebees especially, because they got big fat bodies and those tiny little wings.  They look like they're tired all the time.  Exhausted from flying.  They're just...  Why wouldn't God give them bigger wings if you give them a big fat body like that?  Like a wasp.  Yeah, a wasp.  Nice and streamlined.  But I'm one of those people that looks retarded when a bee comes over to me, because I'm ducking  down, running.  I'm waving my hands in the air. 
[01:02:00]  I just look like Michael J. Fox.  Well, you're dancing like you just don't care.  With my hands in the air.  I was right there with you, Jimmy.  I just...  Bees, here's the thing.  You're 44 years old.  Yes.  How many times have you been stung?  Once in the belly when I was a kid, and once right in the forehead by a wasp.  It blew into you.  And oh, that one got me bad.  Yeah.  Landed right on my forehead and just nailed me. 
[01:02:30]  And I started crying, of course.  What else did I do as a kid?  And then somebody said, oh, you better wash that off or you'll get sick.  And then I just...  And then he wouldn't answer me when I was saying, what kind of sick?  Because I'm thinking I'm, you know, going to drop dead there.  I'm a little kid.  I got a big third eye welt growing on my forehead.  I'm like, what kind of sick?  It's a big crybaby.  We know.  I got stung in my ear when I was a kid.  We know. 
[01:03:00]  In your rear?  Yeah.  In my ear.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I misunderstood.  Yes.  Not the other...  A stinger right in your what?  In your rear.  Yeah.  No, no, no, no.  Right in your rear.  It went in your ear.  It doesn't work.  In my ear.  It flew in your ear and stung you.  Yes.  How many times are we going to do this?  Well, I don't get it.  Sounds like...  See?  In your rear.  In your rear.  It happened right in my ear.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In your rear.  Third base.  Get out of here.  You nuts.  Come on.  Come on.  You're incorrigible.  Let us do the poison part of the bit, please.  Got some poison in your ear. 
[01:03:30]  And so when I...  My friend Frank, who's now a police officer, when he was a little boy, before I know him,  when he was five, he grabbed a wasp nest because it was like on a low...  Nice.  ...underhang.  Yeah.  And he was stung horribly.  He just grabbed the paper.  Why would he do that?  He was a boy.  He's five.  Why grab it?  I probably thought it'd be fun.  Piñata?  Because I didn't like it.  Piñata of death.  Because the man offered him candy.  Oh, yes.  He was five minutes of grabbing wasp nests.  It looked familiar, and he wanted to jiggle it. 
[01:04:00]  Except things that weren't too much fun came out.  Ow.  And my other friend Jimmy punched a hornet nest in the ridge.  Punched a hornet nest.  Yeah, yeah.  That'll show him.  Yeah, they were hanging there, and he just takes his fist, and he socked it off the thing  in the hand.  What was he thinking?  That he could outrun all of the wasps that are coming out after you?  Well, when a hornet nest gets punched off, first of all, the nest probably flies the other  way.  You're not punching it onto your own face.  I'm going to give it an uppercut.  It's not a speed bag.  You punch it once, and they know what screwed with it. 
[01:04:30]  No, they don't.  Their house just got knocked off the thing.  They're probably doing damage control, and you're gone.  They're probably like, what's happening?  They chase you.  Nah.  They're probably like, did somebody just punch our house off the branch?  Oh, Iraq's showing bee swarming footage.  There's a great scene in Apocalypto, where he's being chased by these guys, and he looks  up, and he goes, it's my forest.  I'm not afraid.  So you don't know what he's doing, and he comes back, and he has a giant leaf. 
[01:05:00]  He's holding a giant leaf, and when he opens it, there's a massive hornet nest, and he  throws it.  He flicks the leaf out of this big jungle leaf, and he flicks it at the guys chasing him, and  the hive breaks open in front of them, and they just get destroyed by the bees.  All stung?  Wow.  I don't know any kid that hasn't screwed around with a bees or hornet or wasp nest in  the woods, but usually it was with a big stick, and then you'd poke at it and prod it because  you're a stupid kid.  You hit it like a pinata.  Yeah, and then you'd just whack it open and run away screaming. 
[01:05:30]  Because as kids, you do things because you're just bored.  Let's knock this thing down and see what happens.  I lit on fire in the woods the foam rubber from inside a couch, and like a chunk of it,  you just rip a chunk out, and I lit it because it made the voot voot sounds.  You know, when you'd hold it up, and it would melt, and the drips of flaming plastic would  come off.  It would go, voot, voot, voot, voot, made an interesting sound.  And I made a really interesting sound when it hit my wrist, and I was running like the 
[01:06:00]  nude little girl that got hit with napalm and nom.  I was just screaming.  Wah!  It hurt so bad, and it wouldn't stop hurting.  It was just bubbling and burning through my wrist.  Another Anthony crying story.  Yeah.  So, of course, I wept openly all the way home where my mother cuddled me and coddled me  because I was such a crybaby.  Oh, Daddy yelled and screamed.  That I was a fag is what he would say.  Let's go to, uh, Andre, Andrea, Westchester, what's up? 
[01:06:30]  It's Andre.  Hey, Andre, what's up, man?  I just, I just wanted to say, Anthony, you're retarded if you think, uh, bumblebees sting  you.  Do they not have stings?  They don't sting because if they sting, their guts come out with the stinger.  Yeah, exactly.  And they die.  But they, they, I've been stung by a bumblebee.  Supposedly, they bite more than sting, right?  Uh, I guess that would be a wood-boring bee. 
[01:07:00]  What does it say, Uh, Iraq?  The monster ones you can play tennis with.  Shut up, Iraq, yes.  It says queen and worker bumblebees can sting, but, uh, their sting is not barbed.  Only honeybees have the barbed sting.  Okay, well, let me tell you.  It hurts when they sting you.  I've been stung by a bumblebee.  Well, barbed means that it comes out.  Maybe the bumble, sir, maybe the stomach doesn't come out because I think the barbed part  is what catches.  Yeah, that's what catches.  That's why wasps and hornets can sting over and over without dying.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then you got, like, a regular honeybee.  They have the little barbs and the stinger stays in you. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they kind of, they walk away and half their guts come out.  It's really quite disgusting.  Well, they, uh, bumblebees don't sting.  Oh, this is a good one, too.  Oh.  Oh.  Because they're too busy making tuna.  Oh, that's a tuna, uh, joke.  Is it?  Is it?  It seems, well, she's getting raves on the phone.  Max thinks you're hysterical.  Oh, Max is right. 
[01:08:00]  Laugh it up, folks.  What's up, Max?  Bumblebee, go.  Max, do you have a bee story?  It's, uh, it's time for bee stories now on the Opie and Anthony show.  Okay.  Five years ago, a buddy of mine and I were out riding motorcycles.  And this idiot's riding around with flip-flops and baggy shorts.  And a hornet flew up the leg of his shorts.  Oh, wow.  And just started stinging them on his junk.  Oh.  And he must have got stung about six or seven times.  And he had to lay his bike down.  He was like road pizza all down the right side of his body. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, we, uh, we did that bit.  Can we get, uh, some clips from our, uh, bee stinging, uh, bit we did recently?  Actually, it's about a year or so ago.  Apparently, Travis had to pull over for 30 minutes, uh, because there was a bee in his  car.  See, I can understand this too.  I cannot drive with any kind of insect flying around in my car.  It just bugs the crap out of me.  It's very distracting.  And especially if I don't know what it is at first, I'm just seeing it out of my peripheral.  And if it's a bee, it's over, Johnny. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  I got to pull over, get out of the car and make sure that bee is either dead or out of  the car.  Travis, hello.  Yeah, I'm incredibly scared of bees.  Bees, see?  And I've never been stung, so it's even.  Never?  No, never.  Oh, wow.  Just wait.  It'll happen someday.  And we used to live in, I grew up in Florida for my first 12 years, and we had wasp nests  like everywhere around our house, and I never got stung.  I'm all freaked out now.  You're very, very lucky there.  You ever had an outdoor, uh, barbecue, and there's a soda can? 
[01:09:30]  Oh, yeah.  And you put it down, and then a bee goes in there?  That's one of my biggest fears ever.  A bee in the soda can, you take a swig, and now you have a bee in your mouth.  I'll just spit it out.  What if it stings your tongue, and your tongue swells up, and you're going,  Relax.  It could happen.  Bees are about...  Or you're swallowing, and it stings the inside of your throat.  You'd be dead.  You're dead.  You're dead.  Bravo, Sierra.  What?  Bravo, Sierra.  You don't think that'll happen?  You don't drink soda.  You're a beer drinker.  I did when I was a kid.  What do you think?  I'm eight years old, swigging beers down? 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  I was at least nine before I started drinking.  All right.  Thanks, Travis.  You are.  That was very good.  Very exciting.  You didn't say what happened.  You didn't tell a story.  Oh, with the car.  You're afraid of bees.  With the car, yes.  I was driving.  This happened a couple times.  And you'll notice it in your peripheral vision.  Yeah.  And first, you start driving erratically because you want to keep an eye on the bee, and you  still want to keep driving.  Yes.  You can't just stop.  And so I pulled into a ShopRite parking lot.  I was in New Jersey.  And it took me about ten minutes to strategically unroll the window while still keeping an eye 
[01:10:30]  on the bee and not getting stung.  Yeah, because it's a mission, then.  You've got to get rid of the bee, but don't get stung.  Exactly.  What about killing them, though?  I'm in for the hunt.  I like killing them.  I'm grabbing some kind of rolled-up newspaper thing and just whacking them against the windshield.  You never went like this to a bee?  What?  With your bare hands?  Yes.  What if you hit them perfectly and you squished the stinger right into your hand?  There's a risk there, but you could get it done.  Just a quick little slap. 
[01:11:00]  When I was very young, we used to destroy beehives.  I mean, all of them.  We would knock them down, and we would dig in a yellow jacket nest.  And I stopped doing that.  I got a fear of bees after my friend Denny was running.  And I'll never forget the sight of it.  He was running with his arms stuck out, and there were three yellow jackets on his arm,  and he was just screaming as they stung him.  Dumb Denny didn't wipe the yellow jackets off.  He just ran and let them camp out on his arms, stinging the hell out of them.  Oh, wow.  And my friend Teddy had a bee fly up his shirt one time and was just shaking his shirt and 
[01:11:30]  screaming.  Unbelievable.  We have to get audio from our Super Bowl contest we did.  People are saying it was about two years ago.  Look at the hornets coming out of that nest.  Oh, God.  Yeah, yeah.  Hornets are frightening big animals.  And we talked about that Japanese hornet special that was on Discovery.  If you look up Japanese hornets, they're like 767s with stingers.  They're massive.  They said 30 of them will kill 3,000 bees or 30,000 bees in a nest in an hour. 
[01:12:00]  Just go and just chomp their heads off.  Chomp their heads off.  It's amazing to watch.  The European bees are not equipped to deal with them.  So what they do is the way honeybees defend the nest is like when they come, they all line  up on the outside of the nest.  And these dummies, they take off like planes from an aircraft carrier.  One at a time attacks the hornet.  It's instinct.  Instead of 50 of them jumping on his ass, one at a time goes after him.  So the hornet goes, your head's off, your head's off, your head's off, your head's off,  your head's off.  It's like being an adult and having a bunch of kids running. 
[01:12:30]  It's like a dumb action movie.  Yeah.  Where they come at you one at a time.  All right.  We got to take a break.  E-Rock, do you have that Steve thing?  Oh, look at the size of that hornet.  That's huge.  Well, that's blown up on the monitor.  Oh, oh, okay.  I thought that was actual size.  Look at that.  The phones are lit.  Everyone wants to talk about bees.  Everyone has a bees.  I swallowed a bee by mistake.  Look at this.  Sat on bee.  Brother told him he would die.  He wouldn't die.  Stepped on nest.  Stung a hundred times.  Swallowed a bee once by mistake.  Let's hear these people when we come back. 
[01:13:00]  Taking your bee stories.  I want to hear stepped on a nest.  I thought Ant was afraid of the opposite of wasps.  Got stung by 14 bees when I was a kid.  Video on YouTube of a pet wasp size of thumb.  Hey, Rock, I want to hear that thing.  That thing.  That thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  Very nice.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  All right now.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Comedians, Rich Voss.  Rich Voss.  And Robert Kelly.  Robert Kelly.  All right, folks.  Rich Voss.  May 9th and 10th, which is this week, Friday and Saturday.  Brokerage Comedy Club.  I don't know.  It might help.  It might not.  Who knows?  It can't hurt.  Well, probably. 
[01:14:00]  I mean, I want to tell you what.  Last time I did one of these for D.C., the money I wanted to do it.  You know, there's a lot of O&A fans.  It was really good.  Not D.C.  Outside.  I did the Arlington Drafthouse.  It's a theater.  A little theater.  It's a theater.  They call it that.  It's like a theater outside D.C.  It's cool, man.  Good gig.  I already did it.  I just did it.  And I promoted it.  And these help.  The commercials help.  So this week, and that's Bobby Kelly, I'll be at the Brokerage Comedy Club. 
[01:14:30]  BrokerageComedy.com, Long Island, Friday and Saturday, May 9th and 10th.  Got it!  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  We're talking about bees.  Gosh.  Why?  It's so weird what happens with this radio show.  We talk about very, very serious stuff and the phones are like crickets. 
[01:15:00]  And then you just mention bees and everybody wants in.  Everybody wants in.  Jimmy, what do you got?  I guess Stunt Brain handed you something there.  He certainly did.  That's a good piece of information.  What?  It was a good piece of information.  It was the thing that we all, we're all aware of the Schmidt Sting Pain Index.  Who doesn't know about that?  It's old hat at this point.  Wait, what is that?  The Schmidt Sting Pain Index.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yes.  Of course.  We laugh about it every day. 
[01:15:30]  I must have been sick that day in school.  Yes.  This man, Schmidt, did a pain index thing where he allowed all these things to sting him.  I guess he's a doctor or whatever he does.  Just a lunatic.  Just some guy.  Yeah.  You thought he was just a guy that no creeps in.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  It's his index.  You know what?  Pat Duffy's yelling in another room somewhere.  That could have been me!  Yeah.  We should have Pat Duffy do something like this.  He has a rating system. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  From one to four, four being the most painful, on these insect bites.  Stinger of God.  And I'll go over a couple of them.  All right.  The sweat bee, which I'm guessing is a regular bee.  It's the Jimmy bee on the train yesterday.  The stinky sweat bee.  He gives a one.  A one to the sweat bee, whatever that is.  It doesn't sound like this.  What is a sweat bee?  A bag of shells.  Nothing, apparently.  Yeah.  A little wimpy bee. 
[01:16:30]  Well, he describes this thing.  He says, it's light, ephemeral, almost fruity.  A tiny spark has singed a hair on your arm.  It's giving you a relative comparison.  It's like getting...  It's a litmus test.  It's like getting punched by a Broadway performer.  Yes.  Or Bob Dole.  This just in.  Pat Duffy also has an index that rhymes with the Schmidt index, but it's not quite the Schmidt index.  Yeah, of course.  No.  Wow.  I thought it would get a lot more, Danny. 
[01:17:00]  So did I.  So did I.  Damn it.  Maybe you could have presented my line better, you idiot.  That's basically what Danny was saying.  Hey, I present their lines just fine.  I wrote it when it was relevant.  Oh, you're saying I was too late on the...  You're saying that you lollygagged around instead of getting to the line, and now I know  I'm thinking Schmidt index.  Sorry, Danny.  The fire ant is a 1.2.  It's a sharp, sudden, mildly alarming.  It's like walking across a shag carpet and reaching for a light switch. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, but then you itch like crazy after those bastards bite you.  He doesn't go into that.  Okay.  I'm not trying to pit you against him.  All right.  Well, you know.  I want an itch index after this.  They don't have that.  Because some of these things will make you itch all day long.  The bullhorn acacia, A-C-A-C-I-A.  Bullhorn acacia ant, 1.8.  A rare, piercing, elevated sort of pain.  Someone has fired a staple into your cheek.  That's a 1.8. 
[01:18:00]  That's a 1.8 on the Schmidt scale?  Yeah.  This Schmidt has a high tolerance.  Wow.  A staple is a 1.8 out of 4.  Yeah.  Okay.  I can only imagine what the 4 is going to be.  Well, I have.  This is like a little bit of a curveball.  Yes.  This is the one I didn't see coming.  The bald-faced hornet, which is the hanging hornet nest we all see, is only a 2.  A 2?  And he says it's rich, hearty, slightly crunchy.  That's the sensation, I guess.  Similar to getting your hand mashed in a revolving door. 
[01:18:30]  That's a 2.  2 Rex!  That's 2, though?  2 Rex!  What's a 4?  The R. Bud Dwyer B?  The yellow jacket is also a 2.  A 2 for a yellow jacket.  Now, this is something I think that a lot of people, the majority of people that get stung  by Bs get stung by yellow jackets.  So you're talking about a 2 on this scale?  Yes, hot and smoky, almost irreverent.  Smoky?  Is he describing a wine?  Yes.  This is a hot and smoky, nice bouquet. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, he's a bee connoisseur.  He says, imagine W.C. Fields extinguishing a cigar on your tongue.  All right, that's a 2.  That would hurt.  A lot.  That's more than a 2.  Now, this is 2.x.  I don't know what that means.  Honeybee and European Hornet.  Variable.  Like a match head that flips off and burns your skin.  The paper wasp.  Is where it gets ugly.  Is a 3.  That just sounds bad, yeah. 
[01:19:30]  Paper wasp.  Yeah.  It sounds like a merciless insect, and it is.  Caustic and burning.  Distinctly bitter aftertaste.  Like spilling a beaker of hydrochloric acid on a paper cut.  Ugh.  Oh.  Also a 3.  The red harvester ant.  Bold and unrelenting.  Somebody is using a drill to excavate your ingrown toenail.  Oh, my God.  He's a good writer, if nothing else.  Wow.  Okay.  That is a great image of pain right there. 
[01:20:00]  And now I will admit my stupidity and apologize to the Iraq, who's typically the dumbest man  in the building.  You were going to say apologize to the idiots over there.  Yeah, but I didn't want to humiliate him any further, because I was wrong this time.  No.  The Pepsis Wasp is a 4.  Blinding, fierce, shockingly electric.  A running hair dryer has been dropped into your bubble.  Wow.  He really upped the ante, didn't he?  Yes, he did.  A semi-rig has run over your genitals.  But I'm so dumb, I misread this. 
[01:20:30]  And I said it was a Pepsi Wasp.  So I had Iraq looking for Pepsi Wasp, but he couldn't find it.  And the last one is a bullet ant.  Is a 4+.  4.0.  4 plus a bullet ant.  What's a bullet ant?  Sounds very...  Look that up.  I want to see what...  They're horrible.  Oh, that's probably what somebody says to Kumeya when he leaves the range.  You dropped your...  All right.  No.  Okay, I gotcha.  Long way to go.  Hug low bullet ant.  We like this.  How about this? 
[01:21:00]  A for intense, F for actual content.  The bullet ant is pure, intense, brilliant pain.  Like fire walking over flames charcoal with a three-inch rusty nail in your  heel.  Oh, my God.  I guess he had to up be on it from Staple on the cheek with a two.  What doubles that?  Not funny.  Steve from Bayshore said the top of the list is Dominic Barbara.  Yes, that still hurts.  Yeah.  It's sick.  Leaves nine years of pain and agony in a drained bank account. 
[01:21:30]  We got beast stories standing by.  Wow.  Let's make this official.  Huh?  I want the nest guy.  When Nesca's scared.  Oh, what?  The man who stepped on the nest.  Oh, yeah.  He stepped on their 100 bee stings.  Oh, yeah.  He's still there.  Oh.  Well, that is just...  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, no!  I think he got stung!  How does he do it?  You think he needs some Benadryl?  The bee stories on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:22:00]  How did he do it so quickly?  I don't know.  Why is the question.  Yeah, why?  I don't know.  It's better, but my God, that guy gets everywhere.  Let me rephrase what a bullet ant is.  Pure, intense, brilliant pain like any one of those promos that he does.  Walter in Jersey got...  Well, he had a brother that stepped on a nest and he was stung 100 times.  Walter?  He's dead.  Hey, Walt.  It's Walt from Jersey. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, first time calling.  I love you guys.  What happened was my brothers and I, when we were kids, were out front scraping the paint  on the front porch, all the lead paint and eating the chips.  And when one brother decided to step in the nest, and we got attacked and hung, stung over  100 times.  By the time it was done, my father dumped like six road flares into the nest and dug it out  of ground.  It was like three foot big.  There was a story one time about a guy pushing his disabled kid in a wheelchair. 
[01:23:00]  And he pushed him into a ditch.  Oh my God.  And wouldn't you know who was nesting there?  And the bees swarmed up from the nest and they, of course, attacked the kid.  And the bees are not known to be smart.  I guess they knew not to bite the wheelchair.  So they start stinging the kid.  And the father got stung so bad, he had to run out.  He couldn't get his kid out.  So he left the kid sitting there.  Getting stung.  Yeah.  By a swarm of bees.  That's good instincts.  That's maternal.  Yeah.  Paternal instinct.  Right.  Just leave him there.  It is a burden anyway. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Mike on Long Island.  I'm tired from pushing that thing.  Like, ah, well, I'm blaming the bees.  Go ahead, Mike.  Yeah.  One time I was up to Steve and I was nine years old and my bothy cousins had to build a rock  out of beehive.  We were attacked by bees and I got stung right underneath my eyeball in like the lid.  Oh my God.  Can you imagine?  I must have blown up nice.  I was like nine years old and sitting there crying for about three hours.  Did it hurt?  Oh, it hurt the clock.  Thank you, sir.  Let's say hi to Steve in New York. 
[01:24:00]  Steve.  Hello.  Hi, Steve.  How's it going?  Every time I tried to get honey, they attacked my face.  Go ahead, Mike.  I was trying to ride my motorcycle through Bethpage State Park.  Had my visor up.  Passed a bunch of bees.  Got one caught inside my helmet.  Oh my God.  Didn't realize what it was.  So I just kind of reached in there to see what it was and stung my face like five times.  While you're driving your bike.  Yeah. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  So I was trying to stay up without.  That's unbelievable.  When I was a kid, me and my friend Paul were going to steal comic books.  We had to walk like three miles to steal comics from this comic book store.  And I was wearing satin running shorts, like a little fruit.  I stole my dad's satin running shorts.  But, you know, someone's stomach started gurgling.  So I had to make a, I had to sashay into the woods and make a pit stop.  Sashay.  Yeah.  I had to do the exit stage right into the woods quickly. 
[01:25:00]  Even.  To drop a deuce.  And as I'm squatting there, you know, my underwear, let's just say, were used for sanitary purposes.  So I had to ixnay on them and I was standing there naked squatting and there were yellow jackets flying up between where my shorts and my boyish crotch was.  They were flying.  It was horrifying.  So I'm trying to, I'm working on cleanup.  Yeah.  Bees flying between my legs.  That's, that's not a good, uh, situation.  Let's go to Sean in Boston listening on BCN.  Sean, what's up?  What's happening? 
[01:25:30]  Hey, man.  Um, I was out camping with my family when I was like nine years old.  I'm sitting there fishing, doing the thing.  And then, uh, go to take a swig of my Hawaiian punch.  I got a hornet down my throat.  Coughed up a dead hornet.  And, uh, that was a mess.  You got stung inside?  Inside the throat.  Stung me right in the inside of my throat.  Wow.  Can you imagine?  Right above where my Adam's apple probably was.  Can't that kill you?  That would, like, kill you.  It could kill you.  Where'd it get to your throat?  Wouldn't that, huh? 
[01:26:00]  Where in the throat did it get you?  It's like in the inside, right?  Yeah.  Right in the middle.  He said the Adam's apple.  Wouldn't that swell up your throat to the point you can't, uh, you know, breathe anymore?  Well, I mean, luckily I'm not allergic.  But, yeah, I imagine if you were, it would have been pretty bad.  Thank you, sir.  Let's, uh, go to Alexis, I think, in Boston.  We're doing beasting stories.  I know.  Jesus Christ.  We're going to move on to other things.  But, Alexis.  The phones are exploding with interest.  I know.  How does that happen?  I don't know.  Everyone's afraid of bees. 
[01:26:30]  We don't talk about bees.  It's not like, oh, the bee thing again.  All we talk about is retarded kids and rape.  I mean, we're doing something nice.  This is a fun story.  In the same conversation.  I know.  Yeah.  And how Obama can't win because the white man is doomed and you want to shoot people.  And I want a hooker and you can't stop picking your dumb hand.  He's fat and retarded.  Steve's incompetent.  Dan's a drunk.  And Dan hates his mother.  We get it.  Enough, guys.  Yes.  You know, you're right.  It is about time we change the subject for a second. 
[01:27:00]  We're not sick ponies.  Let's go to...  I'm believing the bees will wind up.  What if they had AIDS?  Tranny?  You're right.  We know.  Let it be known.  I stopped picking my hand ever since they shot me up with steroids for $1,500.  Wow.  That'll make you stop picking scabs.  $100.  Yes, exactly.  Alexis, what do you got?  Hi.  How are you?  Good.  Love you guys.  Well, thank you.  I was at cheering practice at college and took a sip of water and it happened to be inside 
[01:27:30]  the bottle.  Yeah.  And swallowed it, stung me internally in the chest.  Ooh.  It was really, really painful.  Yeah, but it gave you bigger boobs.  It didn't work.  Yeah.  How long can it live inside of you for?  That's horrifying.  There's like a pissed off beef flying around your innards.  Waiting to sting your stomach lining.  No, your heart.  Your heart.  Like you can get through.  Why not?  They say 18 hours, Jimmy.  Jimmy, how is it going to get to your heart? 
[01:28:00]  I don't know.  They crawl in and out of every...  Eaves.  Eaves.  Things of that nature.  I don't think...  I think your digestive system's pretty closed from mouth to you know where.  I don't know.  You know.  Yeah.  It would be odd if it kind of was able to tunnel through your esophagus and...  You're on the bowl.  It just flies up between your legs.  Looking for a faucet.  Which one do you want?  We got to like wrap up our exciting bee talk.  Exciting. 
[01:28:30]  Grandfather had Alzheimer's.  Picked up bee's nest to throw it away.  Neighbor mode 100...  Fool.  Please can we talk to the grandfather guy?  I have to know what happened to this man.  Yes.  Neighbor mode.  A thousand bees on a lawn.  Opened bag and they all flew out.  Got stung on neck at Oyster Bay Festival.  Bees are essential to the ecosystem.  Shut up.  Got stung by a dead bee.  All right.  You want the grandfather one?  Okay.  Yeah.  No one's saying that we want a wand in genocide on bees.  We're just afraid of them.  All right.  Donnie, what's up? 
[01:29:00]  Oh, a canish.  Just eating a wasp's nest, dummy.  You old fool.  Oh, look.  My hat is hanging from there.  He puts it on his head.  I wondered where his derby went.  Look, my Marge Simpson wig is hanging from the ceiling.  Let me put it on my head.  Ow.  Then walks back in the house for supper with the stupid beehive on his head.  Dad, you have a bee nest on your head.  Oh, there's a pin in my hat.  Sorry. 
[01:29:30]  What happened to your grandfather?  No disrespect.  Yeah.  No disrespect, Donnie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So when my grandfather was getting old, you know, he started developing Alzheimer's and  he was visiting my aunt and uncle one day and they had a bee nest like under the deck  in the backyard.  Yeah.  So my uncle went to get some stuff to get rid of it and my grandfather decided to stay  from the trouble.  So he crawled under the deck and, you know, he's crawling on his stomach, picks up the  bee nest to try to get rid of it.  Yeah.  And he got stung in the face probably 50 or 60 times.  Oh, my God.  But he just wasn't thinking that straight. 
[01:30:00]  He just kept getting stung.  He just carried out the bee nest and, you know, dropped it out in the yard, went over  to my uncle and said, there, it's done.  When you're that old, it's time for someone just to put gas on you and set you on fire.  Just take care of it in the backyard.  What did our grandfather do in his younger years there, Donnie?  He grew up in Europe and went, like, he was in concentration camp for most of his life,  you know, when he was young.  So I don't even know what he did back then.  Yeah. 
[01:30:30]  Thanks for taking the fun right out of this.  Yeah, really.  Don't get it, man.  We're old guys.  We're having fun with silly bee stories and you make it serious.  Oh, well, why don't you talk?  I forgot I was calling your radio show today.  What was that, sir?  I said, Jimmy, if you insult my grandpa, I'm going to make you feel bad about it.  See, he had nothing.  Oh, that was too bad the timing wasn't right on that.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  That might be good, though, if you get Alzheimer's and you're in that guy's situation because  you kind of forget about the horrors that you had to endure as a youngster. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, so you find new ones, you pick up beehives and you look at them closely.  Put them on your head.  You need a black gentleman to come in and punch you in the face and knock the beehive off your  head.  Remove your hive.  Hopefully that's what he thinks it is.  Oh, look, a giant condom hanging from there.  Let me use it.  Oh, no, I think he got stung. 
[01:31:30]  Maybe he's allergic.  You think he needs some Benadryl?  Bee stories on the Othian Anthony show.  Yeah, well, maybe take some more bee stories after the break.  Also, we did something two years ago that we wanted to do for many, many years, and we  finally accomplished it.  We got guys to come in.  We put bees.  I think there were paper wasps, which are pretty up there on that scale there of pain.  And we put paper wasps and yellow jackets and some other things into a jar. 
[01:32:00]  And then we had the guys put their junk in the jars.  And the first person to get stung in that area won the contest.  And for years, lawyers would shut us down and would not allow us to do it.  And XM, they must have been sick that day.  I don't know what happened, but they allowed us to do it.  And we got the audio of the finale after the break.  We'll play for everybody.  It's amazing.  It really is amazing.  I'll never forget the sight.  Let me just say this.  Of that guy.  Just junk in the bee hive, the bee nest, sitting on it. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  It's the worst thing I've ever seen.  Yeah.  It's like pushing.  Yeah.  He was like, he wanted to win the contest for bragging rights.  And these guys were in beekeeper outfits.  Me and Anthony were.  Yeah.  Could you get that?  Yeah.  Not the contestants.  They were.  That's how scared we are.  Yeah.  He's in a full beekeeper outfit.  Could you get those?  Morgan left.  Yeah.  Could you get those pictures up on onaradio.com?  Yeah.  We thought Tracy Morgan hated us, but we found out that he was petrified of bees and he ran out of the studio because one got loose, too. 
[01:33:00]  All right.  We'll get the pictures up on onaradio.com later today.  And we'll have the audio after the break.  But first, we're going to sneak in another phone slam from Club Soda Kenny.  Oh.  Yeah.  This morning zoo stuff, you know, it's working out there.  So we got to do a little of this morning zoo stuff.  This is Club Soda Kenny's latest phone slam.  No, that's not it.  What?  What?  What happened?  Tim promo is good, though.  Well, if you want me to play.  No, no, no, no.  For later.  You sure?  I can.  No, no.  What?  No.  They're putting it in my iPod.  All right. 
[01:33:30]  This is called filler.  Jimmy, help me out.  What?  Two seconds?  We're good.  No, it's not.  It's got a cue now.  I like a little dead air every now and then.  Do you?  Yeah, why not?  Club Soda Kenny and his latest phone slam.  Oakley and Anthony's phone slam with Club Soda Kenny.  Hello?  Is Ray there?  Speaking.  Who's this?  I'm calling from work.  I was just getting ready to leave.  Don't bother.  You're fired.  Are you serious?  As a heart attack.  Who is this?  Go to unemployment instead. 
[01:34:00]  Who is this?  You've just been phone slammed.  Why do you keep calling me?  Goodbye.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Good morning to everybody.  You haven't heard yet.  Breaking news.  Hillary Clinton, 9 o'clock press conference, announcing she's going to be the third party  candidate for the presidency of the United States of America.  Now everything's starting to make sense with her.  Is that 9 o'clock East Coast or West Coast? 
[01:34:30]  Sometime after 9 is what they're saying right now.  Because earlier this week, she put $6 million into her own campaign.  Yeah.  And people were like, why would you do that if you know you don't have a chance in hell  to be the Democrat nominee?  And now we're finding out more today.  So we should know a lot more after 9 o'clock today.  Phone number 877-212-ONA.  We got B-Stories. 
[01:35:00]  We got the audio of our B-Contest that we did.  You want to play that?  Yes, please.  We did this contest called, what was it called?  Super Bowl?  Yeah, Super Bowl.  Super Bowl.  Not a clever name.  Danny's in studio.  Well, the grand finale was the Bs, but before that, they were doing other horrific things  with their junk.  Right, Danny?  Yeah, I just don't think we could use that word.  Oh, really?  Well, that's going to mess up everything.  Well, depending on how it's described, it'll get dumped out depending what context it's in. 
[01:35:30]  The junk is fine, isn't it?  Well, if you say that, it's too descriptive.  But how is that descriptive, Anthony?  How is that descriptive?  Believe me, let me just say something.  It's not going to be any violation.  Shut up.  Yeah.  Christ almighty.  We're fine.  We're all panicking.  God, they panic.  Huh?  But there was before, though, right?  They dumped before when we were talking about it.  No.  Not would they.  That's stupid.  Help us out here.  We're trying to get ratings for you. 
[01:36:00]  We're trying to get ratings for you.  We're on the same team.  No, we're fine.  I'm just going to come on the team.  When did you say yes?  Come in for the big win.  You actually said yes?  What's that?  Sometimes it's a joke.  Well, no.  Before the break, I had mouthed when the word was brought up before.  I just mouthed.  I said, did they dump?  And he just shook us.  He was like, yes.  I thought you said, do you have the audio?  You know what he is?  He thought you said, are you the equivalent of a dump?  And you actually went, yes.  Yes.  Yes.  I am.  I am.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  He just told me that he eats pop tarts and pickles for breakfast, this guy. 
[01:36:30]  He must be pregnant.  What?  Just today.  Why would you eat those things?  Pop tarts and pickles?  I had a pickle this morning, and then I just had a pop tart.  That's weird, man.  What is wrong with you?  Breakfast pickle.  Pop tart.  Yeah.  What?  Why don't you make a pickle pop tart sandwich, and then just shoot yourself?  All right.  Wow.  We had Anthony and Jim in beekeeper outfits.  Full, full beekeeper outfits.  Because I'm petrified. 
[01:37:00]  Tracy Morgan was in one of those beekeeper outfits.  And he ran out of the studio because he's petrified of bees.  These guys basically took a jar full of all sorts of bees, and then the contest was on  to see who would get stung first.  And this is how it went down.  Right, Danny?  That's all we need to say?  Anything else to add to this?  Well, this is how the...  I just think it's funny, because this is how the XM show had ended.  Back in these days, we had to be out at a certain time, so the show would kind of count  down, and the computer would shut us off.  Yeah.  So this was like the final 45 seconds of the show that day. 
[01:37:30]  I'm about to play the greatest ending to a radio show ever.  This is completely unedited, except for the beeps for language.  Right.  This is how the show ended that day, because we just ran out of time.  He is basically shaking the jar upside down right onto his...  Oh, God damn it.  You put the entire nest against this...  Oh, my God.  The **** is against this...  30 seconds of the show.  What courage.  30 seconds.  The cameras are rolling.  This is for the title, Matt.  You are a mad man.  Hold the jar. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, my God.  Get the jar.  Again.  Where's the cover?  He needs the cover.  Give him the cover.  Give him the cover.  Give him the cover.  No.  No.  Give him the cover.  Don't spray his ****.  Give him the cover.  Don't give him the ****.  Give him the **** cover.  Give him the cover.  That was it.  And that's it.  We're not editing it.  That's how the show ended.  That's how it cut off.  It's like Platoon.  Zips on the wire.  Zips on the wire.  Yeah. 
[01:38:30]  Definitely.  Well, what happened was when Matt got stung...  Key your mic one time for me, son.  Yeah.  What happened was when Matt got stung, the last thing he's thinking is, I got to make  sure I keep all the bees in the jar.  He's losing his mind because he just got stung in a really bad area.  And these weren't even the bees.  These were those paper wasps.  Right, right.  These were real bad.  And so we got...  A few of them did get loose during the whole contest, but we didn't want a whole bunch  of them loose in the studio.  So we're all screaming like little girls to get the cover for the jar and make sure 
[01:39:00]  that they don't escape.  That was done in the winter where they had to bring bees for us.  And the guy who brought that, he found one on a pole that was like a docile nest because  they were sleeping or whatever they do.  These dopes.  The guy had to shake it and it was just like sitting on his body.  And the bees were kind of like lackadaisical.  Like under normal circumstances, I'm sure the thought of that would have gotten them all  riled up.  Sure.  Hell yeah.  What on us?  Yeah.  Sting it.  Um, I thought we were done, but, uh, Travis is telling us there's two good ones left on 
[01:39:30]  the, on the phone.  So we got to go back to this.  Oh no.  I think he got stung.  Maybe he's allergic.  You think he needs some Benadryl?  Bee Stories on the Oki and Anthony show.  Uh, Stephen S. from Bayshore is asking for that audio for onaradio.com and maybe the video  possibly.  Hopefully, yeah, just, just put the video up there of the guy, uh, getting stung on 
[01:40:00]  his, you know what, by bees.  We'll get some hits today on onaradio.com.  That's for sure.  A couple more bee stories.  Kevin in, uh, New Hampshire.  Kevin.  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Yeah, I, uh, I pretty much have the best story I think ever when it comes to, uh, hornets  and bees and stuff.  Okay.  Uh, when I was about 12 years old, I was walking down the side of the road and I saw a hornet  snatched in a tree.  This is in Maine in the middle of winter and I knocked it off and some bees that I thought  were dead fell out or hornets. 
[01:40:30]  So I picked it up and said, well, this would be nice to keep in my room.  Brought it home.  And as we all know now, once it gets warm.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Uh, here it gets worse.  My mom is allergic to bee stings.  She came home from work that day with about 200 freaking hornets flying around our house.  And it lasted about two weeks before we can get them all out of there.  Well, weren't they grateful for the nice warm thing?  You think they would have showed a little gratitude?  No kidding.  I, I, that's what I'm saying.  I don't know. 
[01:41:00]  Did she get stung?  No, she didn't because she saw the first one and freaked out.  So she had to go stay with her mom about an hour and a half away.  All right, sir, can I correct you?  Not the greatest hornet story ever.  It's a good one, though.  It's good.  Potential.  Yeah.  Potential.  Like me and my girlfriend were banging and they, the warmed up and they attacked my  girlfriend and I left.  Great story.  Yeah.  Mom waved at one.  Yeah.  You know, left me hanging.  Oh my goodness gracious. 
[01:41:30]  There's a bee in the house.  I'll be stinging you real soon.  I'm looking at the kitchen.  Mom's scared.  The son knew it was in there.  Let's go to Ian in Indiana.  Thanks for that phone call.  Of all the dramatic things I've seen.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen.  Goodness gracious.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How are you, sir?  I'm doing pretty good.  Good.  It was the day before I got married and we were putting some hay up in the barn and I 
[01:42:00]  had a wasp fly up underneath my sunglasses and stung me on the side of the nose.  So I look like W.C. Fields in all my wedding pictures.  Oh, that's...  You should have just turned to the side.  Or like, you know, had your pictures taken under a tree or something.  Use those shadows to your advantage.  Yeah.  A little clever lighting like MySpace people do.  Just one picture of your eye.  I'm thinking, though, you get stung on the nose just before your wedding. 
[01:42:30]  You tell the photographer, you know what?  Just go home.  Or just take pictures of my lovely wife.  I'll have my head turned to the side.  Or you spray the bee and then you glue the bee carcass to your nose so everybody sees what's  happening.  Yeah.  So they don't ask questions.  Hey, what happened?  Oh.  A bee's on your nose.  Gotcha.  In every photo.  Not moving.  What a patient little bee.  Travis writes, says he has the best bee story.  It's not.  This is Mike in Jersey.  Mike, what's up? 
[01:43:00]  Mike.  Mike.  Give me a second here.  What?  What?  What did he say?  Give me a second here.  Give me a second here.  Okay.  Let's give him a second.  Sorry, guys.  I got cops over here.  No.  No.  I'm not sure you're okay.  Are you in Philadelphia getting pulled over with a helicopter filming?  I hope so.  Five of those guys, what, taking off the streets, huh?  Probably.  Yeah.  Kind of a...  All right.  At least three of them were.  Oh, the cops.  Sorry.  Whoa, wait.  What do you got, Mike?  The beatings.  I've been watching those all night. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  That was a sound thrashing.  Those three got by those cops.  It was one cop.  He didn't know where to go.  He was just in a frenzy.  He didn't know what pile of cops to help out to stomp.  I'm a huge fan of the cops in general.  And it was a little rough to try to explain what was going on with the one guy who went  from beating to beating to beating.  Yes, Dan?  He's like...  Remember that clip of that old college basketball coach running around looking for a hug at the  end of the...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:44:00]  I think that was...  Jimmy V?  Yeah, it was Jimmy V.  Very good, Dan.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it was just...  Hey, I wasn't there.  So, I don't know what happened.  Obviously, excessive force did seem to be used on the tape.  But then again, it seemed to be used in the Rodney King tape.  And as we all know, that was completely justified.  Rodney King was not cooperating.  He was drunk.  He was whatever the hell else he was on.  And he wasn't listening to the cops. 
[01:44:30]  They could have...  I'm glad they did it because he was a bum.  Yeah.  But they could have pinned them easier.  They could have just clumped them.  Yeah.  A couple of those guys just put their big knees in...  Yes.  You got to dig that stick into their side if they're keeping their hands around the front.  Especially if someone's on the ground.  You got someone on the ground.  And I've heard this from cops.  And they instantly put their hands underneath them.  Because they don't want you taking their arms, putting it behind them, and cuffing them.  You don't know if they're grabbing for a gun in their belt, in their pocket, or anything else. 
[01:45:00]  So you want to get their hands out from under them as quickly and safely as possible.  So in order to do that, you want to beat the crap out of them so they want to start defending themselves with their hands.  And they bring their arms out.  It's a common procedure, which I kind of like.  They're also saying the adrenaline took over.  Plus the fact that one of their...  Yeah, the fact that three of their cops have been killed.  One just very recently.  Yep.  I mean, and again, I wasn't there.  You got some real emotions going on. 
[01:45:30]  I watch movies with CGI.  What do I think?  It's real?  I don't know.  So I don't know.  I watch this video.  I'm like, hey.  I don't know.  What?  What is he saying?  I'm saying you can't believe everything you see.  They did something wrong.  On a video.  What?  They did something wrong.  Did they?  Did they?  Did they?  Did they?  These guys were shooting.  They were shooting.  Even though...  And then they get pulled over.  They get dragged out of the vehicles and get a little talking to.  Well, you talk to them...  Perhaps a bit more.  In a room.  Not in the middle of the street. 
[01:46:00]  With cell phones.  Well, a little Budinsky helicopter should have just veered off and gone to the traffic  report or something.  That's the best helicopter footage since old Reginald Denny took a toilet on the cheekbone.  Yeah, that was a good one.  I think I danced.  You got to do the little, I just caved the trucker's head in dance.  That's right.  Old white man brains on the street dance.  A teetle-dee.  Amazing.  Hey, guys.  We were having fun with B.  Yeah, guys.  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  Well, you had a story.  Oh, we didn't go to the guy. 
[01:46:30]  You said the best story ever.  Well, but Travis says it's not.  Mike in Jersey.  We'll try this again.  Mike?  I'm right here.  Yeah, I know.  All right.  So, listen.  This is what's going on.  I got four people in this car.  My buddy's driving.  Me and my other buddy are in the back seat, and his girlfriend's riding shotgun.  So, this B comes out of nowhere.  He gets scared of the B.  We're riding down this dirt road.  He jumps out of the fucking car.  Excuse the F-bomb, gentlemen.  Or the effing car. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  One of those cars.  Who jumps out of the car?  The guy driving?  No, no.  The guy driving jumped out of the car.  So, we're in the car with nothing to do.  Now, me and my buddy are in the back seat.  His girlfriend's up front.  We go off the road and crash into the woods.  My first instinct was get out of the car and kick the living crap out of my friend.  And I did.  I ran up to him, and I kicked him right in the frigging face.  And then what happened after that?  Oh, man. 
[01:47:30]  His girlfriend got an airbag in her face when we hit the tree going off the road.  Wow.  Dude, that was terrible.  Oh, my God.  What happened after that?  Oh, man.  We had to get ambulance.  The car had to get towed out of there.  It was a big, big mess.  Damn.  What, uh...  Then what happened?  Oh, man.  I don't even talk to that guy anymore.  Forget it.  No, huh?  Yeah.  He almost killed me over a frigging B.  You kidding me?  Right.  Then what happened after that?  Like, he almost killed you after...  Then where?  Yeah.  I kicked his ass. 
[01:48:00]  His girlfriend got taken to the hospital.  Yeah, you said that, though.  What happened then after that?  What happened?  That's it, man.  I went home.  I got a ride home from a police officer.  No, no, no.  No, Matt.  Mike, you can't just go home.  I mean, what happened?  Yeah, what happened?  Before he went home.  Before he went home?  Yeah.  Yeah, like, what happened?  You don't just go home after that.  I did.  And what happened when he got home?  What happened?  What do you mean, what happened when I got home? 
[01:48:30]  What happened after that?  It's the end of the story.  You got to tell a story.  What happened?  You think I'm Stephen King writing a frigging book over here?  No.  Stephen King.  No.  So, basically, you're saying you don't have the big Stephen King ending.  It's just real life stuff.  No, no, no.  You go home, and you have a bowl of cereal, and you go to bed.  Yeah, it was.  All right.  Yeah, I mean, I thought that was pretty good.  I mean, a guy jumping out of a car because of frigging bees in it while his three friends  are in there.  That is a good one, but I wouldn't classify that as the best bee story ever.  I would say that was a good driving story. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  Because it didn't end well.  Driving story?  All right.  And then, I mean, I hit my friend, and I went home and watched the Golden Girls.  Okay.  Yeah.  Would that have tickled your fancy, Jimmy?  Your fancy.  Your phrasing, sir.  Yeah, this guy's all right.  All right, man.  Thank you.  My grandmother used to have a coffee cup when I was a boy.  I said, if you tickle my fancy, I'll tickle yours.  Yuck.  Until I broke it across her teeth.  I hated that cup.  She was sipping tea out of it, and I punched right through that cup. 
[01:49:30]  Well, off to these stories.  I'm going to juice on the elderly.  Did that tickle your fancy?  Exactly.  How about if I tickle your dentures with my knuckles?  All right, we got Hillary's big announcement coming up at 9 o'clock.  She's going to become the third-party candidate.  That could really, really screw up Obama.  I don't know where she's doing.  That's crazy.  Yeah.  Obviously, she wants McCain to be elected, and then in four years, maybe she'll take another shot at it.  Yep.  And right now, drunken Orson Welles champagne commercial outtakes. 
[01:50:00]  Now, I think this is different than the ones we've played over the years.  The faithful listeners love these outtakes by the great Orson Welles.  This is when he just completely gave up.  Like, the ones we played earlier, he was really trying, and he considered himself a great actor.  Yeah.  This is after he just gave up, became quite a drunk, and he'd be in the studio just wasted.  Danny, what do you got?  Well, yeah, this was some champagne commercial. 
[01:50:30]  He'd whore himself out for everything.  And it's an American champagne, isn't it?  It's not even like from France.  Yeah, I think it's a French champagne, but the first piece of this audio, just listen  for how long this pause is, because he was waiting for someone else to do something.  And they go, all right, and go.  And it's just hiss for a long time.  And he's audibly either buzzed or drunk, or he's on something.  Or just old.  Drunk, old, or on something.  There's something in his voice.  All right.  With overlap, action piece. 
[01:51:00]  Action awesome, please.  Did you just do anything?  No, sorry, cut.  No, really.  Wait, what did he say there?  He points to this woman, and he just goes, she doesn't do anything?  She doesn't do anything.  What is she supposed to be doing?  Did you just do anything?  No, he said, sorry, cut.  No, really.  102, take two. 
[01:51:30]  Ah, the French champagne.  Wow.  Rachel, the French champagne.  No.  Mr. Faber-Sham.  Rosebud.  No.  He was one of the greats.  What the hell is he doing?  Just retire at this point in time in your life.  Ah, the French champagne. 
[01:52:00]  Has always been celebrated for its excellence.  There's a California champagne by Paul Masson, inspired by that same French excellence.  It's fermented in the bottle and like the best French champagne.  It's vintage dated.  So, Paul Masson.  102, take three.  Action, please.  Ah, the French. 
[01:52:30]  Ah, the French.  Oh, crap.  This guy's great.  The director was just...  Why don't we take three?  Ah.  Oh, the French champagne.  Champagne.  Like he's been drinking it in between every take.  Yeah.  Vitamin and Benjamin.  This is labeled drunken Orson Welles on YouTube for people at a computer already. 
[01:53:00]  102, take three.  Here we go.  Action, please.  Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.  There is a California champagne by Paul Masson, inspired by that same French excellence.  It's fermented in the bottle and like the best French champagne.  It's vintage dated.  So, Paul Masson.  Cut.  Oh, cut.  Cut.  You're a goddamn mess is what you are. 
[01:53:30]  That's all he got on that one?  That's too bad.  We love Orson Welles' audio.  I wish there was more of that somewhere.  We've played that certainly over the years.  That's great.  Champagne.  Champagne.  Give me more of it, you bastard.  I think we're done with B-Stories.  We can't get anyone...  No one else can get through because we got them all jammed with B-Stories.  These just inspire people to open up. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah?  It does, huh?  Yeah.  People just want to talk about their bee experiences.  Ah, when I was stung by a bee once, right in the tongue, ten minutes ago.  It's lush.  Who doesn't enjoy a nice game of catch out in the sunny weather with mom and dad?  Just having a good time.  And who doesn't enjoy a newborn baby? 
[01:54:30]  So sweet.  So lovable.  And oh so possible.  Announcing the first annual Opie and Anthony baby throwing contest.  It's like shot putting, only with babies.  Stay tuned for details.  Heading towards the finish line with the Opie and Anthony show.  We might have time to play one of our old games today.  What did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  You can give us a call with that, 877-212-ONA.  Francine's in studio. 
[01:55:00]  Hi, Francine.  Hey, you guys.  I see you're sitting on Jimmy's lap there.  Absolutely.  Do you like Jimmy?  Yes, I do.  Yeah?  He loves him.  He doesn't like Jimmy.  And you gave Jimmy a card?  It's a thank you card because he gave me a job recommendation.  A job recommendation?  Really?  Yeah, what's that?  Where are you dancing?  It was for us.  It was in a planned parenthood.  Hangar girl.  No, it was, I gave her a job recommendation. 
[01:55:30]  It was some TV.  I didn't even know what it was, but the guy called me and he asked me for, you know, what  Francine, so I left him a message.  I guess she got the job.  So, um...  Doing what?  TV production.  Really?  Really?  Yes, there's lots of buttons to push on the machines, so it's going to be fun.  Lots of buttons to push.  Yeah.  How did you get the job?  Are you qualified?  I smiled a lot and I wore really tight clothes.  And that's how you got it.  He's so honest.  I love it.  And so, because of that, you gave Jimmy a card. 
[01:56:00]  Do we have the Francine story?  It's so worth playing, man.  One of the greatest moments on this radio show is Francine's ridiculous story.  Trying to think, though.  I might need some edits, I think.  Oh, really?  Maybe tomorrow, then.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  You're hysterical sometimes, though.  Why?  I don't know.  It's just like, there was a porno I was watching the other day.  Let's just throw it on.  Why not?  Let's throw it on the air.  Well, because she's in studio.  No, it's because, like, on this side, there's some things that are so impossible. 
[01:56:30]  It's just like, it was a great scene I saw on Platoon.  Let's just throw it on.  It's one of those, you know...  Yeah, I got what you're saying.  F-S mother...  But you gotta keep trying, though.  You know what I mean?  Hey, I'm all for it.  If it was up to me, I'd put that story on right now.  You never know.  It could fly on this side.  Somehow, somewhere.  Nah, probably not.  All right, what's the card, Jimmy?  Francine, can you use your card to me?  Yeah, when she uses the term...  And I won't be...  It's not in any context, so it's really fine.  When she uses the term, it fell out. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, that would be a problem.  Yeah.  They would have a problem with that down the hallway.  They probably would.  Oh, I understand that one.  Okay.  What's this card about?  All right, I was gonna ask Francine to read, but she's shy.  I'm very shy because the card's very special.  Why are you in the city today?  Because you don't come around too often.  That usually means you got business in the city.  No, I moved to Maryland.  You don't even live in the area?  You don't live around here anymore?  No.  So why are you up here?  My brother's graduating from college on Sunday. 
[01:57:30]  Is that really, like, or just somebody you know that's also black?  No.  What grammar school?  He's on the book, too, but...  My brother.  Yeah, he's my old brother.  No, he's 23.  So I came here so we could drive up to Maine today.  You're going to Maine for a graduation?  It's still winter up there, you know.  No, I think it's summer.  The seasons change on the 23rd.  Nah.  It doesn't do.  On the 23rd.  And right then, it changes, and it's not cold anymore in Maine. 
[01:58:00]  There's an equinox, and there's a tilt on the planet, and then the sun rises, and something  happens, and it gets warmer.  So...  All right.  Well...  She's got the basics in there.  23 and a half degree tilt.  Francine is sitting kind of on my leg.  Not exactly on...  She's not sitting anywhere.  She shouldn't be.  She's sitting on my leg, but I'm looking at her from the side.  And it's so sexy watching her mouth as she talks into the mics.  It looks like the Warriors.  Sorry about that, Warriors.  Sorry about that. 
[01:58:30]  No, Francine, you should read it.  Come on.  Yeah, read the card.  You're my friend for a long time.  It's not a love card.  It's just a very nice card.  And no one's ever heard you say nice things.  I say a lot of nice stuff.  You're like what?  Okay, I'll read the card.  Thank you.  Hey, Jim.  Thanks so much for your recommendation.  Sometimes when I listen to you on XM, I think,  Boy, that guy is a kook.  And I had not known you, been able to get to know you.  Perhaps I would still think that. 
[01:59:00]  In reality, you are a sweet and kind old and gentle soul.  And for that, I'm grateful.  Thanks to you from the bottom of my heart,  your kind words will be remembered.  Friends for life, Francine.  Thank you, Francine.  Hallmark.  How about that, Francine?  Now, the problem ahead of the card, as nice as it was...  Yeah, I'm wondering why you would have a read it.  Yeah, I know what part you think is a little...  Yeah.  Because reading it, it says this.  Sometimes, when I listen to you on XM, I think,  Boy, that guy's a kook.  Oh.  Because he's called a C-O-O-K. 
[01:59:30]  I'm like, why would you think...  How ironic.  That was a very lovely card from Francine.  That was very nice to read.  Kook.  Why would it be ironic?  It's a little inside joke we have about black people.  Yeah.  White people all have inside jokes about black people.  Just like black people have inside jokes about white people.  We do?  Yeah.  Well, you're not really black.  You're like...  No.  You're a Tootsie, right?  Not a Hootoo?  I'm a Tootsie Roll.  She's a Tootsie, not a Hootoo. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, she explained that to us one day.  Yeah.  Hey, Francine was telling somebody in the office  that she's been on a date with a guy three times,  and she hasn't let him even kiss her yet.  What the hell?  That's a little weird because you're a little...  You're a little slut.  You're a little loose.  No, not anymore.  You're a bit loose.  You're not?  I read a book.  You read a book and that...  You read a book?  An entire book.  And what was the book?  It was so good, I read a second one by the same lady.  It's called Why Men Love Bitches.  Oh, no.  And it ruined you?  Yeah.  Oh, God damn. 
[02:00:30]  What did you learn from...  You know, you were almost like I was even considering  that you could have been my first black chick ever.  Really?  Yeah.  And when I heard that you broke up with Belinda,  I was hoping...  That I could...  But now you read this goddamn book and wrecked everything.  Were you really hoping?  Ah, damn.  I thought about it.  Could have been my first...  My first once you go black...  I think we should have a baby.  Your family abandons you.  No one has to know.  A baby?  Yeah.  Now you're pushing it.  Baby. 
[02:01:00]  You should have a kid, Anthony.  I don't think I should.  Do it, Anne.  Fatten her up.  Yeah.  Fatten her up.  Yeah, but what I learned...  Watch it end like the last one.  We know this little story.  Yeah, I know.  That cute little story she has.  I want to know what she learned from this book.  Why men love bitches?  Yes.  One of my girlfriends gave it to me because she said,  you let guys walk all over you and that's why you never get any respect and that's why  they don't call you back.  So, I decided to read the book that she gave me and it said that guys are really mean to 
[02:01:30]  girls because girls are really, really nice.  So, I decided to be really, really mean.  And now guys like me and call me back.  By holding out and stuff?  Yeah.  How many pages was this book?  A lot.  A lot and that's what you learned from it, that one statement?  The clock.  Yeah.  The big clock.  Tick tock.  The end.  No, no, no.  It was good.  $12.99.  And she said, like, you know, don't give them money and don't give them rights to places. 
[02:02:00]  Who's this bitch that wrote this book?  Yeah.  I hate these bitch-destroying bitch books.  No, but she was good, though.  Maybe for you.  Not good for us.  Not good for, yeah, guys.  She said, wait, three months at least.  Three months.  Before you do what?  Before, yeah, what?  Before you have sex.  Before sex.  What about before that?  How far can you go before that?  A little, a little, oh.  No, nothing.  How about a little, um, uh, if the guy wants to do something to you, you know?  No, you're not supposed to. 
[02:02:30]  You're not supposed to take your clothes off?  What about a little cop-a-feel?  Maybe like, uh.  Heavy petting?  Heavy petting, maybe like, she said, maybe a month in.  A month in.  Yeah, she said, never go over the guy's house.  Yes, because anytime you go over a guy's house, that means that they're going to expect sex.  And I always used to go over to their house and just not do anything.  And I used to wonder, well, why don't they ever call me back?  This is really a cruel.  Because, you know, I want to have sex sometime, but not yet.  So, I don't go over guys' houses.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:03:00]  And she said to give them jujubes.  She said, you know, every time they do something for you, you, you know, give them a little.  Like a doggy treat, like you're training them with jujubes?  Yeah.  A little bit at a time.  And then, eventually, two, three months down, you give them the sex and stuff.  Jujubes in lieu of sex.  I don't know if that strategy's working.  These books are horse crap.  I thought it was very eye-opening. 
[02:03:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Did you?  It's legs opening that we're trying to work.  Yeah.  It's eye-opening and legs closing.  I hate that book.  I haven't had sex in so long.  It's crazy.  How long has it been now?  I think since January.  All right.  That's longer than three months.  Yeah.  What, do you hook up with a guy and it lasts like two and a half months and then you got to reset?  No, I was having sex with the same guy for like a year.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  White guy?  No, actually, it was a black guy.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  That might have wrecked you. 
[02:04:00]  I was dating a white guy, though.  Yeah.  Do you want to give it to me?  Who was better?  Or, like, who was, like, more, you know what I mean, in bed?  Who's better in bed?  Yeah.  White guy or the black guy you were with?  I think in general, the best sex I've ever had was with a half-white guy.  So I think it's...  Half-white?  Yeah.  The combination of the two.  He was a mulatto, right?  A mulatto.  Yeah.  Oh.  Right.  The best sex ever. 
[02:04:30]  Well, she's reading books now.  This is scary.  That is frightening that she's reading.  And we also learned that she would have had sex with you, Ann.  I know.  But now she lives in Washington.  Why do we have to have a baby?  Why don't we have to have sex with you, people?  Just have the sex.  Like, always got to dump out a kid.  Why do you want Anthony's baby?  Because I'm going to turn 30 next year.  What?  Really?  29?  What happened there?  I'll be 29 in November.  She was, like...  So now my clock is ticking.  22 years old or something.  We met you when you were, like, yeah.  The clock is ticking.  You're still in college. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, you're too old for us.  Get lost.  Shove.  Hit the brick, sister.  Am I too old for you, Anthony?  No.  I think I'd make an exception because, you know, it would be interesting.  I think it would be interesting.  I have, like...  When are you leaving for Maine?  Tonight.  Is it good to time?  Tonight, you know.  Are you voting for Obama?  No.  I'm a Hillary fan.  Boo.  You heard what she's doing at 9 o'clock, right?  What's she doing at 9 o'clock? 
[02:05:30]  She's going to announce that she's going to be the third-party candidate.  My neighborhood would go on lockdown.  She doesn't have a chance to get the Democratic nomination.  So she's going to run anyway?  As a third-party candidate, yes.  Are you serious?  Independent, yes.  Announcement's coming up at 9.  That should be good if you're a Hillary fan because she doesn't have a chance any other way.  No, but that's awful.  She'll be like that guy who did that thing to Gore.  That guy who did that thing to Gore. 
[02:06:00]  I know what she's saying.  Because another guy ran the Green Party.  Well, Ralph Nader, right?  Yeah, so she's like the new Ralph Nader.  Well...  I think if Obama gets the nomination, seriously.  What is Anthony laughing at?  Let's see.  I'm guessing this would be if I took Francine home.  My neighborhood would look like the Omega Man.  It's just the white guy and the black girl and a bunch of angry Jews trying to get into my house.  Like you would let the neighbors see what you're bringing in your house. 
[02:06:30]  Would it be okay if I pulled up first, I went in the front door, and then you kind of just snuck around and came in the back?  No.  That, no?  With cleaning supplies?  Would you dress, yeah, as a maid?  So you could come in?  Because my neighbors would be really angry with me.  They're very nosy, very suspicious.  If I brought a woman of color over my house.  I've worked for three Jewish companies.  Yeah?  They love me.  Yeah?  Of course not.  Do Jews like you?  Yeah, they do.  They really do.  Well, they like you maybe working there, but the second they see somebody pulling up next door, and the house next door, well, the house next door to me was sold to Jews. 
[02:07:00]  No, there's a new couple moving in next door to me, and that would just scare the crowd, and they'd be like, oh, where's the for sale sign?  Well, you know what?  You save money, though, because they'll build their fence first.  Who are you kidding?  Your neighborhood?  Ah, that's funny. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  What else you got, Francine?  This is called filler.  We've got to get a couple more minutes in before we leave here.  I don't know.  My mind's blank right now.  What do you mean right now?  There's nothing in it.  Oh.  You said you read two books.  What was the second book you read?  Why Men Marry Bitches.  Ah, the thrilling sequel.  All part of the bitches series, I see.  Yeah.  Oh, very nice.  Same general message.  Be a bitch. 
[02:08:00]  Be a cunt.  Wow.  Whoa.  That's...  I certainly hope...  Whoa.  Whoa.  That's very interesting that it's still...  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She also said...  I certainly hope there wasn't any distractions down the hall.  Francine dropped a C-bomb.  Yes, she did.  You got something on Mariah Carey, too, Francine?  Well, I didn't know she got married.  Yeah.  It says...  Who heard her say this?  Yeah.  Well, me and Sam were in the back.  She was talking.  Francine's flipping through the papers. 
[02:08:30]  And Francine had no idea that Mariah Carey had released a wedding album.  Released a wedding album.  Okay.  Getting...  Well, there's only one picture in me.  Are you going to pick it up on iTunes later?  No, I'm not a fan of Mariah Carey anymore.  I'm very upset with her.  Why?  You used to be a big fan of her.  Yes, I was a very big fan of Mariah Carey in the 80s.  But I think she's just not a good singer as she used to be.  She doesn't hit the high notes anymore.  Well, those were annoying.  They really were. 
[02:09:00]  With that whistly sounding yuck.  I Have a Vision of Love is one of my favorite songs in the whole world.  Why?  Because she hits all those notes.  You just like the song?  No, the song is very lovely.  Let's say hi to Spiro.  Spiro, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show today?  Well, fellas, today I learned that if my friend jumped out of a moving vehicle and left me to die,  right after I kicked him in the face, I would service his girlfriend. 
[02:09:30]  Swing and a miss?  One flag!  One flag of fun, sir.  I didn't hear that, actually.  Yeah, you heard it, Jimmy.  My headphone's on late.  Someone's asking, is Jimmy sleeping?  Well, Jimmy's very happy because he's got Francine on his lap.  Well, she's on my leg, but I know Francine and I are sharing a microphone, so I'm letting Francine talk.  Yeah.  You got any...  No, no, no.  It's not...  Oh, God.  The potential could be there because Francine's very sexy, but it's not a...  Would you have sex with Jimmy?  Yes, I would.  Look at that.  Thanks, Hope.  If it wasn't for that damn book. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, that dumb book.  You're going to throw that book out the window within...  Three months.  You've got to wait it out.  You're not waiting three months.  Yeah, I'm telling you.  What if Jimmy wanted you, like, now?  Right now?  I can't.  We've got to date and see if we like each other.  You know, the jujubes.  Jujubes.  That friggin' book screwed her up really bad.  I like the idea.  She's right.  I like it.  Shut up.  You do not think she's right.  I do.  Jujubes.  Just go to the bathroom while I get you a beverage.  She likes... 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, exactly.  I'm eating jujubes.  With the book is that usually you give it up so quickly that, you know, they get what  they want and they leave.  But the book tells you to wait because then they have to wait for it.  So then they have to wait to see if they like you.  So now you're waiting to see if you like them too.  How do you know they're not just moving on to some prospect that is maybe a little easier?  See, you're listening to a chick.  You know, the guy side of this whole thing is that guys that do that are just nerds. 
[02:11:00]  That wait?  For three months?  I understand waiting a little bit, but three months of waiting?  Those are nerds.  I used to wait for three months in like junior high.  That's an early high school kind of a thing.  So what's appropriate?  When you're taught it.  Appropriate?  What's the appropriate amount of time?  Yeah, you guys tell me.  15 minutes.  What?  Yeah, maybe 20. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, maybe 20.  Yeah, 20.  15 minutes is a slut.  Depends if there's a good song on the jukebox.  Yeah.  Jukebox?  What do you get out of the car for?  Park head.  That's all for you guys.  All right, Francine.  Thank you.  What about weeks?  What?  What about weeks?  Well, I mean, if you want the real answer, like three months, way too long.  Yeah.  Okay, well, what's the real answer then?  A few weeks?  Sure.  Why not?  A few weeks? 
[02:12:00]  A few weeks, sure.  I think it all depends.  All depends.  Sometimes it would take a while, but sometimes you just hit it off immediately.  But Anne, she's talking three months with like nothing, right?  Yeah, you get kisses and stuff.  Some kisses?  Maybe some what?  Peelers, but no sex.  No actual sex.  Like Bill Clinton says that something isn't sex.  Do you agree with him?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  That's so weird to me.  That's not sex?  That's not sex. 
[02:12:30]  I mean, come on.  Come on.  What?  Sorry.  No, you're just talking low.  I want to hear all the goodness you got.  I think it might have been dumped.  Oh, really?  Oh, she messed up again?  My wife messed up.  All right, we got to get out of here.  Francine, thank you.  Thank you.  Have fun in Maine at that graduation and the new job in Maryland, right?  Thank you.  And we'll see you next time.  I will be back for sure.  All right.  We're off to XM.  Guys, have a great day.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:13:00]  XM 202.  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice? 
[02:13:30]  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw.  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial Radio Personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  I go into her room, and there are panties on the floor.  Oh, you're getting creepy. 
[02:14:00]  I had to pick up the panties and put them on.  I can't believe he said that.  I still didn't know something.  Opie and Anthony.  Catch up a baseball.  Oh, nice.  Oh, that was nasty.  I didn't hit him hard enough.  Opie and Anthony.  Terry Shivo, I loved you in the grudge.  Will you be doing more voiceover work?  This is the worst show I've ever been on. 
[02:14:30]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Here we are.  XM Satellite Radio.  How's everybody today?  Doing all right?  All righty.  I'm not talking to you.  Oh, I thought you were talking to the staff and everyone else.  No, I like to talk to the imaginary people.  The fake imaginary people that are supposed to be on the other end of this microphone.  Listening.  If you really think about it, it's the dumbest thing ever. 
[02:15:00]  We talk to you.  Hi.  Who are we talking?  We don't even know who we're talking to.  But they're listening out of a little box or something in their car.  Yeah.  Some of them are nudes.  Hi.  Some of them are having sex right now with our voices in the background.  Some are chopping a body somewhere.  And some people are stuck in dungeons.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Being sexually abused.  Let's hear the...  Nice.  At my house.  Let's do a bit today.  Right off the cuff. 
[02:15:30]  Look at this.  The sounds of our listeners.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  Ah, the sounds of our listeners.  Maybe you work in a morgue and you're getting ready to saw a skull.  Oh.  I want to hear the sounds of our listeners.  The saw.  Whatever that means.  The sounds of our listeners.  It could be hardcore sex.  It could be...  I don't know.  Knowing our listeners, we'll get a lot of fucking horns. 
[02:16:00]  I'm driving.  Meh, meh, meh.  Great.  Thrilling minutes.  Hey, Tony's here.  We could do a douche chill theater.  This bit is just, wow, sweeping.  Sweeping the O&A community.  Did you guys address Tony and Pat's situation?  No.  We were too scared.  They're both in.  They are both in today.  Yeah, they're both in today, Jimmy.  So I think that this is something that...  I don't want it to be ugly, but I mean...  You mentioned Tony.  Oh, I do.  I hope there's...  Battle Royale.  Oh, Tony.  Fist of cuffs.  How are you?  Good.  Oh, it's something that we didn't do and I was out the next day. 
[02:16:30]  I'm traveling.  Hidey, hidey, hidey, hidey.  That was the type of thing I bet you do at home when you're alone.  That was one of those weird old moments.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We all have them.  I'll bring some weird old moments in for you.  We did this one already.  We did the Rob Williams.  All right.  This is...  This douche chill theater is like just sweeping the O&A community.  It's just unbelievable how this is taking on a thing of its thing. 
[02:17:00]  Go ahead.  Say it.  On a...  All right.  Just say it so they can fucking write in and complain.  On a...  On a...  On a...  Does everything take on a life of its own?  I didn't say that.  Copy, paste.  Copy, paste.  I'm trying to use different words.  Let's change tone for the show.  It's taking on an age of its abortion.  Hidey, hidey.  Wow.  Am I going to hate that one fast?  Why do you think I did it? 
[02:17:30]  I know.  Of course.  I have this sick thing with Jimmy.  I like to do shit to annoy the fuck out of him.  You really don't, though.  I mean, it's...  I don't...  I find all stuff to be very enjoyable.  In a fun way.  Yeah.  In a fun way.  Like, I know...  We really were going to give up on that Tim bit with those three guys.  I know I've said this a bunch, but we were going to give up.  We thought, just like Jimmy, like, yuck.  Yeah.  But then I looked over at Jimmy, and it annoyed him so much.  I'm like, you know what?  No.  This has...  There's something here.  It has to continue.  And now I kind of like it in a bizarre way.  And the listeners know that we're just doing it to fuck with them. 
[02:18:00]  So I think they enjoy that, too.  Yeah.  And they know we're just being dicks.  Hey, I'm going to try the sounds of our listeners.  Let me try one.  Could be a bust.  James in Riverhead, Long Island.  How are you, sir?  Good, Opie.  What's going on, man?  This one's for you, okay?  This is sounds of your listeners.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  He's not a fan of the vacuum.  Oh, my God.  Ugh.  Ugh. 
[02:18:30]  That was my favorite.  I just love this one.  Mwahah.  Mwahah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  I thought I sound drunk.  Ha.  Fucking drunk.  They call me Opie the Moocher.  I told you I could do some voices.  That's right.  Uh, let's, uh, do the sounds.  You have to do it like that, Jimmy.  Help me out.  The sounds listeners.  The sounds listeners. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, but, all right.  That's fine.  All right.  More bees on, uh, Fox News.  One bee can travel up to four miles to pollinate.  That's bullshit.  Yeah, what the fuck?  The fucking lie.  So sick of the fucking fox lie.  No spin zone.  Eat my asshole.  Oh, there's a bee expert. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, yeah.  Thirty-six percent of the beehives have been lost in the United States.  Really?  Yeah.  What happened to them?  What happened?  How are they lost? Just listen for the buzzing sound.  If everybody could just shush for a minute.  Speaking of the sounds of our listeners,  can we get a mic on the four people that decided to walk with us today?  Oh my god, look at the crew we got.  Oh shit, look at this. They're waving and everything.  The sounds of our listeners are just balls.  What?  Nothing.  I was saying balls because they're all men. 
[02:20:00]  Let's say hi to...  Hold on.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  All right, we're in the middle of the sounds of our listeners.  It's Jason in Jersey.  Jason.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey, I'm drill mixing right now.  You want to hear that?  Yeah.  Drill mixing cement.  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  Oh my god.  Awful job.  I feel like... 
[02:20:30]  That sounded like a root canal drill, man.  Of course not.  Now drill mixing cement.  That sounds like any woman you're dating talking to you.  Yeah.  I'm drill mixing cement.  Why don't we...  We got to continue until we get a good sound, like something unusual.  Charlie in Philly, the sounds of our listeners.  What's up, bu-bu-boy?  How are you, sir?  Yeah, I just wondered if you want to hear a bulldozer tracking across the job site.  Sure.  Sure.  Bulldozer. 
[02:21:00]  Bulldozer.  So the sounds.  All right, let's get it.  Rick, the trucker.  Rick?  What's going on, fellas?  Hey.  I want to do sounds to the listeners.  Yeah.  I'm on my way to South Dakota right now.  What are you hauling?  Uh, right now I'm empty.  You want to pick up a load.  Ooh.  Got to love it.  At 425 a gallon, they got me driving 353 miles empty. 
[02:21:30]  This is the sounds?  Yeah.  That's the sounds.  No, it's this one right here.  You're going to ruin the pitch.  Very good.  Very good.  Let's say hi to Carl in New Jersey.  Carl?  I'm empty.  You want to pick up a load?  Carl.  You've got to love it.  At 425 a gallon, they got me driving 353 miles empty.  Carl.  See, the sounds of our listeners.  The loud radio.  See, that's what he said.  It's the loud radio.  I get it.  I get it, Carl.  You're going to ruin the pitch.  Oh, my God.  Matt in Fort Worth, Texas. 
[02:22:00]  Matt.  Yeah.  The sounds of our listeners.  What do you got?  I'm working on a drilling rig here in Fort Worth, Texas.  Yeah.  Well, here you go.  It's an oil drill.  You don't want to roll?  Earl.  You find any earls?  Nothing?  She's a gusher.  Let's go to Jeremy in Cleveland.  These are the basic sounds of our listeners.  Now we've got to get a little weird if this bit's going to take off and take on a life of its own. 
[02:22:30]  Jeremy, Cleveland.  Oh.  Well, thank you.  Blue Heeler has the sounds of your listeners, and I'll play the sound clip for them.  Boo!  And this guy's got a chainsaw.  He's in space.  It doesn't sound like a chainsaw.  He just opened the fucking door in space by accident.  Let's see what it feels like to open the door in space.  And that was he had been sucked out already.  His phone's still just dangling there, feeling silly. 
[02:23:00]  That's my dream, to go up into space and just hang out.  Yeah.  This guy has an anniversary.  He wants to let everyone know about Todd in Utah.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Todd.  Hey.  Hey, first I want to say I love you guys.  It's chill, man.  You guys rock, dude.  I'm a new listener, and I just started listening to you guys, and I love listening to you guys.  You'll appreciate that, sir.  Tony!  Do us chill theater.  Yeah, I got a freshie there for you. 
[02:23:30]  Where are you at with Pat Duffy?  I haven't heard anything since.  I guess you guys played the audio the one day before the Beastie Boy guy came in.  For that riveting interview?  Yeah.  I was in Times Square, so I didn't get to come in and talk about it.  But I haven't spoke to him really since.  It's kind of been on the back burner.  You haven't talked to Pat Duffy since the big fight on the Than and Sam show?  No.  Really?  Well, Pat Duffy is here today.  Yes.  Why would I? 
[02:24:00]  Pat Duffy and Tony both trying to get the next job, that coveted spot, that will be open  very, very soon.  Next year?  Oh, looks like Steve decided to show up at 925 today.  Hi, Steve.  Jesus Christ.  I was talking to Stunt Brain.  Talk to him at 11.  I needed to talk to Stunt Brain.  I had to pick his brain.  So that's how it is to work. 
[02:24:30]  Yes.  Wow.  What do you mean you brought something they were talking about and added to it?  Yeah, that what?  The bees.  The Sting Pain thing came from Stunt Brain today.  There you go.  We got to admit, my read of it was very good.  It was terrific, Jimmy.  The Schmitt scale was just something...  Oh, I know.  I love the Schmitt scale.  I do, too.  Everything should have a Schmitt scale, like cunt odor.  What is emodium nitrate? 
[02:25:00]  Is that for poopies?  I don't know, actually.  All right.  Because sounds of the listeners, look, we warmed up.  Now let's get into some shit, man.  Let's get some fucking explosive diarrhea sounds and stuff.  It's up to you guys.  Let's go to Keith.  That's what we need on this show.  More shit jokes.  Hey, how you doing, boys?  Hey, good.  Emodium nitrate?  You mix it with diesel fuel and you make one heck of a bomb.  That's what they blew up both the home of the city building with.  That's ammonium.  Oh, emodium nitrate.  Emodium.  You're thinking of emodium AD.  Yeah, I sure was.  Ammonium. 
[02:25:30]  Draft fertilizer.  I figured you guys always want to hear something cool that someone's hauling.  I figured 47,000 pounds of that mixed with some diesel fuel will make one shit load of a boom.  So you get a boom?  Well, I'm not going to do it.  Hell no, I don't want to blow myself up.  I just thought it would be pretty cool to tell you.  The bit is called sounds of our listeners.  Well.  Yeah, not the potential.  Hang on a second.  No, we did that already.  Jeremy in Nashville.  Jeremy.  All right.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  I'm working in an office, so I'll see what I can do.  All right. 
[02:26:00]  That's a pencil sharpener.  Watch out, boys.  This has potential, don't you think?  We should do this every Thursday.  Yes, I like that.  Mark in New York.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  I'm out here at Staten Island.  The sounds of your listeners.  We love you guys.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Deuce Chill Theater.  So, Tony, yes.  Yeah.  It's a deal.  It wasn't.  I haven't done it for a little while, but it's ready to go. 
[02:26:30]  You guys should.  You want to know who it's about or just play it?  Well, you're good with the setups, my friend.  Oh, it's an in-studio guest, our favorite, Bob Kelly.  Why is he part of Deuce Chill Theater?  That's not nice.  No.  You know, it's the ones we love.  Good one.  What?  Breaking news on CNN.  Hillary Clinton.  Independent candidate.  Yeah.  There it is.  It's going to wreck, it's going to tear apart the Democratic Party. 
[02:27:00]  I knew something was up because she refused to get out of the race.  And everyone's telling her, get out.  Ah, Tony, Deuce Chill Theater with Robert Kelly.  Shall we just go right into it?  Yeah, please.  On this episode of Deuce Chill Theater, rotund comedian Robert Kelly brilliantly impromps  his way through an audition for the wildly popular Burley Bear Network.  Ready?  All set? 
[02:27:30]  Great.  Sitting here six days waiting to do this.  My butt is asleep.  Great.  Just saw Sandy, a little sweetheart who everybody loves, including myself.  And I, you're probably wondering who I am, Robert Kelly.  I'm going to be with you for just a little bit.  So please stick around because you are watching the Burley Bear Network.  And check us out.  Is that good?  Is that all right?  If by all right, you mean a tightly puckered asshole and goose pimples from shoulders to 
[02:28:00]  wrists, then yes, Mr. Kelly, it was all right.  Oh, and by the way, Sandy hates your guts.  Join us next time on Deuce Chill Theater.  I got an idea for your next Deuce Chill Theater.  Sam's working that. 
[02:28:30]  The next installment of Deuce Chill Theater.  I tried.  Should I get a new voice?  Of course you should.  Deuce Chill Theater.  He's a one-trick pony.  He really is.  Sam.  Why?  With his voices.  They all sound like some wannabe English kind of a thing whenever he's doing production.  Now you know what I'm working with, Anthony.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  I think the only other English accent was Steve that could do him.  Yes. 
[02:29:00]  When I asked.  Well, let's hear Steve's English accent.  Maybe we could do auditions today for the new voice of your Deuce Chill Theater.  I like the idea.  Oh, good idea.  Yeah, where's Steve?  Or is he still with stunt brain?  Yes.  I was talking to Lisa about a promotion.  We're giving away Dr. Scholl's.  We need girls to get naked and shave their cunts in Times Square for Dr. Scholl's pads.  Steve.  I know.  I know.  Well, who else?  I did before.  Oh, my God.  Welcome aboard.  Thank you so much.  He's just pushing out fear. 
[02:29:30]  That's not what it is.  That excuse does not work with me.  That is unbearable.  That is disgusting.  It's unbearable.  It smells like a fucking sewer in here.  Oh.  Thank you.  Jimmy, I love you, but your colon is really offensive.  Why showing up at 925, Steve?  You know, I apologize.  That was...  Stunt brain?  You and stunt brain again?  No.  That was me and Maura, actually.  Maura, the alcoholic GM?  I don't know that.  That's what you were telling us.  I didn't say that at all, actually.  How about this?  After she released his XM, both shows are equally important.  I put a tremendous amount of value on the XM show. 
[02:30:00]  That's right.  I don't...  I certainly do as well, and I certainly wouldn't...  What did Maura have for you today?  We were going over the promos that apparently we are now...  We are still allowed to air those...  Remember those pre-recorded XM promos that they told us we couldn't air?  Oh, because...  Wow, that's a real...  I have to grab these people when I can grab them before they go into meetings, and then  I can't talk to them.  Fuck them!  Tell them 11 o'clock.  We got business to take care of.  And then I get yelled at, why isn't this done, Steve?  And then I'm going to get yelled at, because... 
[02:30:30]  How about this?  Wait, what happened?  Who's yelling that?  Yeah.  We all do.  Yeah, I know.  When it is my turn to get yelled at for not getting certain things done, I can now say,  I got it done, but I had to spend 15 minutes talking to the GM.  Are you having a nervous breakdown?  No.  Jimmy, is he having a nervous breakdown?  He's falling apart at the seams.  He's falling apart at the stomach stapling.  Yes.  No, anyway, what are you doing?  I'm auditioning for Douche Chill Theater. 
[02:31:00]  Tony wants to hear your English accent.  Yeah, because I guess...  What's the line, Tony?  You could say, on this episode of Douche Chill Theater, start with that.  On this episode of Douche Chill, Douche Chill Theater.  Wait, wait, wait.  Maybe we should try something else.  What was that?  I don't know.  It was horrible.  English.  Proper English.  Like, proper English.  Snobby.  On this episode of Douche Chill Theater. 
[02:31:30]  Higher?  Higher?  Higher what?  Higher pitch, please.  On this episode of Douche Chill Theater.  Okay, I kind of like it.  What's the fucking line?  Say, Sandy hates your guts.  Sandy hates your guts.  Thanks for your time.  You're welcome.  Wow.  That's what you like to try out.  We'll call you.  It's my problem.  You're in my fucking house.  That's right. 
[02:32:00]  No.  Nothing's wrong.  Stay in the living room.  I'll handle it.  I got work to do.  Will you blink?  What do you want?  You're not blinking anymore.  I got a lot of pain meds.  A lot of pain meds?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because I haven't started my physical therapy for my backhand.  So I put my lot of pain meds.  Are they down very low or middle of the back?  Up high.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Ew.  All right.  The sounds of our listeners.  It's Lynn in Houston, Texas.  Lynn.  He's getting here.  Yeah, I'm here. 
[02:32:30]  Shh.  Hey, guys.  Good evening.  Okay, you ready for my sound?  We certainly are.  Okay.  All right.  Here we go.  This would be the sound.  I just thought it was time the ladies got her.  Get to it.  All right.  This would be the sound of my naked breasts slapping together.  Are you ready?  All right.  Now we're talking.  Okay.  Hang on.  It's nice.  Okay.  Do you hear it?  Like two fleshy click clacks. 
[02:33:00]  It's an odd little sound.  And why would you only do it two times?  You got to do it a few times.  It was like four, but you didn't get them all.  All right.  Well, I'll do it again.  How big are these boobies?  These are jitties.  Wow.  Okay.  Did you get it?  Now do that while falling into a sinkhole.  Okay.  We'll do it.  That sounds kind of cool.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, have a good day, guys.  All right.  Goodbye, madam.  Good luck.  The sinkhole story is trumping the Hillary Clinton announcement.  Sure is.  It's all about this huge sinkhole that just swallowed up a few houses. 
[02:33:30]  You know where I'm going with that?  I think so.  Okay.  It really wasn't well-hidden, was it?  You know, this has nothing to do with anything, but the boobie thing just reminded me of the  Borat video we were watching this morning.  Oh, yeah.  I'm just finding an excuse to play this thing, but he's being interviewed by this lady that's  well-endowed and has nice boobs, and how he describes her nice breasts is probably the  best explanation ever for a really nice breast. 
[02:34:00]  That's quite the Borat way.  Can we find that?  Sure.  All right.  See, now we made it something.  Now people need to hear that.  See how that works?  Dan in the Poconos.  Dan?  Hey, guys.  Champagne Tower still?  Oh, no.  This is a different Dan.  Wow.  Hey, uh...  What?  Poconos Dan?  There's too many Dan.  I'm in Dan.  Yeah.  Hey, sorry.  This is Dan in real life.  I didn't name myself.  Hey, uh, I got a sound for you.  Okay.  This is a sound Keith the Top makes when he's doing Anthony's panties. 
[02:34:30]  Hey, he got a big laugh.  That shouldn't even have gotten a laugh.  Yeah, it was a sniff.  Well, I mean...  I know, but...  No one was buying into the panty thing, but...  You're a ball.  ...keep the, you know, the cop smelling your underwear before he throws them in the laundry.  That's kind of funny.  The boys out on the bleachers like this.  When Keith comes, I wonder what part of it he's smelling.  If it's the ball sweat or the ass crack was rubbing.  I don't even...  Which one of those two?  Or is it where the pre-cum builds up, right? 
[02:35:00]  Anthony's fucking pee from his dick helmet.  Let's say hi.  That little fucking pungent sour smell on the front.  The clear fucking spot.  What the fuck are you...  Listen, he fucking wears your underwear like he has the mumps.  And he just rotates them according to what he wants to smell.  All he jerks off angrily with his fucking...  His trousers undone and his gun dangling.  You think he's an angry jerker, that Keith?  Yeah, he probably clenches his teeth when he jerks.  He doesn't even know he's angry.  He just grinds and clenches his teeth like a coke addict. 
[02:35:30]  You think he does a shame jerk?  The shame jerk?  Yeah, when he's got Anthony's underwear.  That's why he only has his dick out.  Yeah.  He just has it poking out of his police blues.  He's humiliated.  He's actually jerking you off with Anthony's fucking used underwear on his face.  I don't see that happening.  It comes in his own hand.  Yeah, I picture that too.  You do?  Yeah, absolutely.  Why don't you and Jimmy get together and you can trade stories and fantasies and the truth  of the matter can be something completely different. 
[02:36:00]  By the way, we have another gentleman we have to bring here at one point.  We're forgetting.  Who?  Pat to the Duffy.  Oh, where is the Pat to the Duffy?  Pat Duffy.  Where is he?  Pat Duffy to the studio, please.  I think he's out there signing WOW stickers.  Oh.  Pat, sit down.  Now, I heard we were doing that bee thing earlier, which was a big hit on today's show.  Right.  And I heard that you were very sad because you want to save the honeybees.  Well, yeah.  The honeybees are dying at an alarming rate.  Yeah?  Yes.  Oh, right.  He's a nature guy and he punches people that happen to throw cups on the ground. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, is that why you fucking had a problem with that guy?  Because he littered, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  You know what?  I heard the same thing when I was going through the channels and I thought to myself,  hmm, I wonder what's on ESPN.  Well.  I care quite a bit about the honeybees.  What's going on with the honeybees?  I've heard that they've lost like 35% of their population.  Yeah, they're dying off and really not a lot of people know why.  It's called colony collapse disorder and they're trying to figure out what it is, but  if there's no honeybees, then there's no plants.  So there's no life.  Bullshit. 
[02:37:00]  You'd think honeybees are the only ones that pollinate.  No, but they pollinate a lot of fruits that we use every day.  Every little animal pollinates something, especially flying little animals that land on things.  You've got to have more faith in the scientists.  They're going to grow bees soon.  That's right.  Is it our fault?  Is that what I'm being led to believe?  Once again, and the only enemy they have is man.  I hate that.  The fucking guilt part of any nature show.  Yeah.  The population has been dwindling and they have no natural enemies. 
[02:37:30]  The only reason is man.  I'm a fucking dick.  I'm a dipshit fuckhead.  I'm the one going up there, fucking them up.  So what?  So that no flowers means what?  Means nothing.  No, if they can't pollinate certain things and we can't get like, you know.  So this whole life thing, we're counting on these dumb bees?  Well, bees make up for a lot of the stuff that we eat.  Like you're eating strawberries or raspberries right now and blueberries.  Yeah.  But honeybees pollinate both of those.  They're blueberries.  No way to pollinate those on a farm or anything without fucking bees, right? 
[02:38:00]  Well, they've been moving bees into certain farms to do that, but they're running out  of bees because they keep dying.  No way to do it artificially.  Just go get the Mexicans.  Don't take care of it.  Put some Viagra in the bee, honey.  They all start fucking.  They're now eyedroppers to Mexicans and problem solved.  Think about this.  Seriously.  Seriously, does this world that we fucking live on have one species of animal on it that 
[02:38:30]  if they're gone, the whole fucking thing collapses?  Pat Duffy.  No.  You honestly think that?  No.  That if the honeybee went away tomorrow, just completely 100% gone, that we'd all be running  around naked fucking killing each other until the sun burnt out?  As much as I would like that, no.  I'll tell you what it is.  I don't.  Aphids.  Aphids.  Aphids.  Yes.  The all-important aphids.  It's true.  The aphids?  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Ladybugs. 
[02:39:00]  Because they eat aphids.  Oh, oh, oh.  Ladybugs are crucial to our ecosystem because they eat aphids.  Yeah.  They reproduce at such an amazing rate.  Mm-hmm.  Then we come out with some aphid spray and just spray the shit out of everything and kill  the aphids.  No, you don't get it.  They reproduce so quickly.  I'm for just killing everything.  How do we save the honeybees?  Yes.  Thank you.  Matt Duffy, comment.  Well, you can go to helpthehoneybees.com.  What?  There is not a helpthehoneybees.com site. 
[02:39:30]  You're fooling.  There is.  They have the stupidest things you can do.  Yeah.  Like what?  Don't swat them.  Don't kick over hives and put gas on them.  Pretty much.  Don't shit into a bee's mouth while he's yawning.  Boo.  Don't do that joke.  What are some of the dumb things you can do to save the honeybees there, Than?  Plant bee-friendly plants.  Like what?  Is my raid tree bad?  Tony, what do you think of Pat wanting to save the bees? 
[02:40:00]  I think it's ridiculous.  I probably, and I meant to tell you this, but I haven't talked to you since this weekend.  I was driving my Tahoe, which is like eight cylinders, and I was eating Slim Jims and throwing  the wrappers out the window.  I was thinking of you.  Of course you were.  The whole time I was doing it.  Of course you were.  Wait till I tell Duffy.  What's going on with you two?  You all right now?  I'm okay.  I guess.  I don't know.  Are these two okay? 
[02:40:30]  I don't know.  I haven't really.  No, they still hate each other.  I haven't seen them since we went down.  Kenny, you do realize we're doing a radio show, right?  You're whispering as we're trying to talk to him.  Would you like a beverage?  Did you see the bee movie?  No, I didn't.  Zinc.  Nice.  That was the good thing to say?  Yeah, that explains everything.  There's nothing to worry about with bees.  Put my blue bars down.  Thank you.  We're holding them what you swear.  No, I mean, what am I going to do? 
[02:41:00]  I mean, there's going to be no physical.  This is like a reality show here.  People are just go at each other to hit each other so that they don't have a job.  There's going to be no physical violence.  I don't want to see physical violence.  Well, I'm saying, you know, there was a little confrontation.  I don't think it's going to go to physical violence.  I'm not going to get, but if you, you know, in terms of the Thane and Sam show, it was  a matter of, yeah, I felt like he was in my territory and he shouldn't have been there  and he opened his mouth and I had to defend my turf. 
[02:41:30]  What turf?  That's how I felt.  I'm not sure.  The Thane and Sam show.  Why?  Pat Duffy's a big star in the Thane and Sam show now?  No, he came to his first one, the past one.  All right, what's wrong with that?  That's where the argument came from, that one night.  So the big argument is you guys are arguing who should be hired first, right?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Now, his argument is what I do isn't as good as what he does and vice versa.  And we go back and forth and it's up to you guys.  I don't know.  I'm not going to hit him. 
[02:42:00]  I eat asshole.  I don't know.  Who eats asshole?  That's the famous clip from Thane and Sam.  Oh.  Oh, damn it.  What the hell?  What happens when they're not labeled?  You're not going to hit Pat.  It's okay.  No, I'm not going to hit Pat, but if I throw something on the ground and he comes after me,  I can't promise anything.  I can't promise that.  Are you afraid of Pat?  No.  What, are you kidding me?  Afraid of Pat?  He gets some rage going, though.  Yeah, we had him shaking really good.  Jimmy, you missed this.  Robert Kelly pushed his buns to the point and he got really shaky. 
[02:42:30]  He freaked out.  He was yelling at him to get mad, to get mad, and then he started throwing things at  Pat until Pat was shaking uncontrollably.  Yeah.  He's got real problems.  What's he doing?  Oh, you didn't hear the construction worker story?  Yeah, I did.  Oh, you were here for that.  Okay.  I agree with Pat on that, although his methods were a little rough, but I agree with him.  Sam?  Thank you.  What's going on here with these two?  Sam, please, contribute.  Well, Tony also felt like, uh, Than and I hadn't given him a fair shake because he felt  like we were leaning more towards Pat Duffy's side. 
[02:43:00]  Um, they haven't spoken at all.  Like, they don't speak when they're here.  And they're trying to avoid the issue because Tony says that he has done more for longer  and believes that all Pat does is shit stunts.  Right.  Shit stunts are good.  Whereas Pat says...  Well, what about him stapling his forehead?  See, this is my...  What a staple gun.  That was pretty impressive.  All the stunts are good for the show.  Yeah.  They're all entertaining.  Yeah.  But my point is, if you're hiring for a position, I mean, really, you could get, like, uh, who's 
[02:43:30]  the kid, Magoo, who drank his puke?  You can give him, like, a t-shirt and he'd do anything Duffy would do.  Like, there's no, there's, I mean, like, it's hard to find people who are skilled and  creative and, uh, you know, have, can, can write, like, uh, anything, basically, for  a show.  Um, and you could get a fan, give him something, and, and he'll pretty much do that.  So, that's my argument.  Yeah, Tony's argument is that I'm a, I'm a super fan and that I only do things to impress 
[02:44:00]  you guys.  Uh.  That's what we like.  I don't, I don't, I don't think that's true.  But, Tony, you said.  Tony thinks that he has the creative mind, whereas Pat Duffy is just kind of doing whatever  you guys would tell him.  Tony looks at it like it's Lugosi and Karloff.  Like, that way, when Bela Lugosi looked at it, like, uh, who gives, you know, anyone  could do that.  But here I am.  Huh.  I'm saying.  I'm just saying, if you, if you, if we were both gone tomorrow, he's, he is ten times easier 
[02:44:30]  to replace than I am.  All you gotta do is search on, I bet you one of these five guys out here to, to get on  the radio would rub some shit on their head.  Make a shit happen.  I don't agree with that.  Yeah, it's a tough one.  Pat's, um, above and beyond guy.  You know?  He's no, I'll, you know something?  You know Dave.  I don't know, he's beating Dave in the shit thing.  Dave is crazy.  He brushed his teeth with shit.  With dog shit, which is one thing.  Drive dog.  Dave took shit out of his ass and licked it off his fingers. 
[02:45:00]  Child's play.  He brushed his teeth.  Well, quite literally.  With the shit of another species.  I cross species lines.  Dave, his own shit is, is, is the safest shit you can, I'm not, no, I think Dave is great.  But your own shit is the safest shit.  Dave would eat any shit though.  Is that a famous quote?  Who said that?  That was, uh, that was said in the, in the, uh, the, uh, Revolutionary War.  It was, uh, give me liberty or give me death.  And then your own shit is the safest shit was overshadowed.  Because the guy with give me liberty, give me death, yelled it louder to a PA system. 
[02:45:30]  Um.  In the 1700s.  Yeah.  It's a long, long.  Yeah.  So what, what bits have you brought that we've done?  Because we did do show theater.  Uh.  You've been there for two years, right?  Yeah, I mean, there's, there's a ton of writing.  I've since, I mean, the first, the first month I was here, I was getting stuff produced.  I mean, all, ever since then to all the way now, I mean, I just, I handed, before I knew  how to do the actual production, I would give it to Steve or Derek and, and they would make  it.  And then all the way up till now, I mean, dozens, I, you know, and then I'd pull audio 
[02:46:00]  for whatever stories I give it to you guys.  I did some Larry King, a lot of news anchor flubs over the years.  Uh.  Uh, I mean, I, I don't want to, it, it sounds.  What are some of the production pieces?  I'd like to know.  What are some of the things you wrote for?  Well, the, uh, right, let me think.  I got the, they did the two, the two douche chill things that when I first came here,  um, I wrote, there was a promo about something like Dice said something.  I wrote that, uh, that I used his quote and made fun of it and we wrote, and there was 
[02:46:30]  a promo for that.  But, uh, I, I mean, see, it's hard to put me on the spot, too.  I can write it down and come back to you in five minutes.  You're being vague, though.  Yeah, because hold on, in two years, and I, it's just nervous.  Well, I'm not going to be able to think of it, and I'm going to come off like an asshole  quoting, you know, like, tooting my own horn, too, for anything I've done.  Nice promo when you first got here.  So two years ago.  Uh, and, hold on, two installations of douche chill theater.  I would say probably, uh, eight to ten news anchor flubs I've done. 
[02:47:00]  That have been played on air.  I found them myself.  Cool.  And, and gotten them to there.  You could ask Danny.  Usually I give them to Danny, and he, he reads, uh.  Why is Danny giving them for a weird walk?  Oh, you're saying usually I give them to Danny, and Danny, like, takes credit for him.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  He's right.  That, that happened once or twice.  Face.  All right, once or twice.  The CD I gave him that he played the one day had three on them.  So, I don't know.  Yeah, and, like, two we already had, so.  Uh, well.  Danny's very good with audio, so I.  Yeah. 
[02:47:30]  He's the best.  Yeah, Danny's, that's his, his thing.  He finds a weird, weird, weird, great audience.  Yeah, no, and I, I'm not discrediting Tony at all.  He's, he's handed one, a couple of things.  But, literally, it's been, it was a couple of things.  Okay, a couple of things.  Okay.  I'd like to disagree with that, but, yeah.  Well, hold on, let's work it out.  That's what we're here for.  It's fine.  We get, yeah, no.  Defend yourself.  I am.  I, I, I think it's eight or ten.  I probably could find them in my folder right now.  Pull them out.  I'd save everything.  Duffy, what, uh.  I'd save it.  Are you holding back any stunts?  Uh, well, I tried to the last time I was in this with the thumbtacks, but that was, 
[02:48:00]  that was a no-go.  Really?  Uh.  He's got a, uh, he's got a thumbtack a bit there.  Yeah.  What's that one?  Well, I, I always have about 400 thumbtacks in my backpack at any given time, in case  they want to make a thumbtack bat, or things like that, in case they want to do something  like that.  Thumbtack bat.  Why would you just, like, kind of, not need them?  Exactly.  Spontaneously.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Who knows why we would need it, but I have it.  You're like James Bond or something.  No, he's like a cartoon character. 
[02:48:30]  Right.  I need thumbtacks to sprinkle on the floor.  Yeah.  I mean, that's just the, I don't know, that's just a stunt, I guess.  I mean, I wanted to do the, I wanted to test out the pain index of the stings.  I wanted to do each one.  Let's have him get stung by something.  Yeah, because.  We have EMS here.  On the helping with the honeybees, you can, you can offer to keep bees so that you can  raise honeybees, and I was thinking about doing that.  In the city, Pat?  No, I live in New Jersey.  Yeah.  In Brooklyn?  You're going to raise honeybees now?  I was thinking about it.  What the hell's going on? 
[02:49:00]  You can't just decide you're going to raise honeybees.  Why not?  Because there's all kinds of equipment you need, and education, and, yeah, details.  A box and some flowers.  Details.  See those shit dicks, fucking pollinate.  Right, there.  This is all you need.  I'm going to work.  So, Tony, you've got to defend yourself better.  We've got, so far in two years, 24 months, two installations of Duke Shelf Theater, a Dice  promo two years ago, and a couple of pulls.  You say, Danny says it was a couple of things, audio, and you say it was ten. 
[02:49:30]  You'll take ten.  I've, uh, a couple times that I've been on air, I've been on air for over an hour the  first time, and over an hour and a half, which gives a lot of radio.  I did all those bits I wrote, uh, that I read to you guys in the office.  You liked every one of them.  I read them on the air.  You liked them all.  Um, hmm.  On two and a half hours on air?  I'm, I'm fucking adding this up.  Hold on.  I want to break this down by, we have, seriously, we have to do this fairly, because we'll go  over dump your stuff, too.  24 months, let's just say ten bits. 
[02:50:00]  I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt.  I'm going to say Danny's player hatin', if you can forgive the term.  Oh, let's just say that's one audio poll.  Yeah.  Every two months.  Now, two and a half hours on the air.  Stan, you want to break out the old calculator?  Sure.  Oh, shit.  What?  24 months?  Let's just do, uh, six.  Two and a half hours is 120, 150 minutes.  150 minutes and two years is, uh, what?  24 months.  Is, uh, yeah.  Add this on, too.  We're just doing this one thing at a time. 
[02:50:30]  This is obviously going to add up.  Mm-hmm.  What's that?  Uh, I can't figure out my calculator.  I know you can't, sweetie.  I knew this would be a problem.  That's why I'm opening mine.  It's way less than a minute a day.  6.25.  6.25.  What?  Seconds a day?  Minutes per month.  There you go.  6.5 minutes per, how much?  6.25.  6.25.  So, 6.25.  Divided by 30?  No, divided by, uh, four.  Let's just go weeks.  Okay.  That's 1.56. 
[02:51:00]  Now, divide that by five, because that's days.  Uh-huh.  0.3.  That's minutes.  So, it's about 30.  No, point.  Like 20 seconds.  Yeah, 0.3 of a minute.  So, 20 seconds?  20 seconds.  A day.  Okay, 20 seconds a day.  Fuck.  20 seconds of airtime.  A day.  All right, I'll put your heads up.  I mean, you know, boom.  Smart ass.  And meanwhile, I got mentioned three times on the FM show today. 
[02:51:30]  Just by myself.  Well, that's because you're sticking your nose in every two minutes.  Am I ever in there?  First of all, fucking Stunt Brain took my seat.  Am I ever in the studio?  Oh, no.  Not Stunt Brain.  Stunt Brain.  He's already a problem.  Took your seat.  Yeah.  I always sit there.  You don't like that?  Well, not really.  What are you going to do about it?  Probably nothing.  Stunt Brain's ass?  Just attack him.  So, you think that he's basically buffalo on his way in?  Well, no.  I mean, like, the big thing was he almost got into a tussle out on the streets in New York. 
[02:52:00]  Like, if every time I, you know, I had a problem at a bar or something or I smacked somebody in the mouth, I came in here, I'd be barging my way on every month or so.  Well, you're doing big fucking tough guy theater.  No, I don't do it.  I don't act like a tough guy who'll throw water bottles, you know, get all upset about it.  And I don't bring it up because I don't feel like nobody gives a shit.  Well, I don't like litter bugs.  That's all right.  See, there are certain things, though, where you say, like, I don't feel like anyone gives a shit.  But Pat Duffy attacking a construction worker for throwing a bottle, he realized that's good radio. 
[02:52:30]  It also makes you realize that he's unstable and he probably shouldn't be working in a place like this.  Well, perhaps.  You're right.  Yeah, but look around this joint.  Who is stable?  But you also did say that you smack people in the mouth at a bar a lot.  That's not a sign of stability.  Well, not a lot.  I'm not saying it has to come to that.  It has to come to that.  I don't go around looking for it.  And then I don't bring it up either.  Tony threatened to slap me in the mouth on the Thann and Sam show.  It's for radio.  Oh, okay.  Are you afraid of Tony?  No. 
[02:53:00]  Not at all.  Why do you laugh when you say that?  That's kind of awkward for everybody.  Why would I be afraid of Tony?  Tony's a big kid.  He's probably a powerful dude.  Right.  But you just get a little quicker.  Then we can't catch up.  It's not hard to outrun a huge, huge dude.  You're calling Tony?  Huge.  I said huge.  Would you run away from him?  Well, if he came after me.  Like it was Cloverfield coming after me.  You're calling Tony a big monster?  Perhaps.  Sorry.  I'm like 8-0 on the streets, Duffy.  Anytime you want to come at me, maybe take a shot at the fucking title, you come at me. 
[02:53:30]  You want to go punch for punch?  You can't punch for punch in a place like this.  All right.  Why do you want to get you?  Because it's going to turn into...  Listen, I don't play fight.  If you hit me, I'm going to choke the shit out of you until you're unconscious, and that's  the end of it.  I consider it an attack, and I'm going to not stop until you're passed out or immobilized.  That's the end of it.  I don't fight for fun when I have slap box.  No.  Who might as well run fucking races?  You want to do that?  Yes. 
[02:54:00]  Because I'll win.  100 meter dash.  Let's do it.  How about a push-up contest?  All right.  What's punch for punch in the face?  Why not?  I don't know.  In the face?  Well, I would go for the face.  It's a great idea.  Thank you.  The arm, maybe.  Wow.  That would be over real quick, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know with who, but punch for punch, if you just wound up and hit somebody, I think  the first punch, it's over.  There would be one punch, and then there would be a melee, and that would be the end of that.  Yeah. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah, because you wouldn't go punch for punch.  No.  If anybody touch it, if he touched me, I'd defend myself, and that would be the end of it.  Yeah.  You'd kick his ass, you think?  Uh, if I had to, yeah, I could take Duffy.  You could take Duffy?  No.  The cycle factor only goes so far.  Duffy, you think you could beat him?  I think Tony could beat me up, but I would stab him.  Oh, so now you're talking like attempted murder instead of just a gentleman's kind of a fight.  Well, he wouldn't stab him to kill him, we all know that.  Right, just hurt him really badly.  Yeah.  Like prison shanking. 
[02:55:00]  Exactly.  In the ass like five times real quick.  He would stab his elbow.  That would hurt a lot.  Yeah.  Brian from St. Louis.  The stars of this show hate vacuums, walk around the house naked with guns, and pay people  to shit on them.  Where's the fucking stability on this show?  Walk around naked with guns.  That was so true, no one could even laugh.  Like, that was so accurate, it just hurt all of our feelings.  Right.  I know.  How about a dick measuring contest?  Ooh, I'm up for it.  They don't call me old ruler mouth for nothing. 
[02:55:30]  Just kidding, I don't want to snuck a dick.  Ricky M. from Massachusetts said just that.  Someone's getting excited.  More sounds of the Opie and Anthony show.  We got Joe in Jersey.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, boys, how you doing?  Hey.  What does it play?  Sounds of the Listener.  Okay.  All right.  Inside Anthony's head.  This is not the biz. 
[02:56:00]  It's not the things that we do.  There's no reason cutting it off.  I'm not trying to be rude, but...  All right.  Nice to...  Well, I'm...  Oh.  There's something in the house there.  Mike in Florida, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Isn't the sound of the listener what we're listening to while we're listening to you?  Here we go.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[02:56:30]  What's the buzzing part?  Did you get that?  No, it's porn, right?  Porn and a hammer chisel.  Oh, I thought it was a hammer chisel.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, it did.  Sounds like a hammer chisel.  It certainly is.  Sounds like a...  All right.  Well, this Tony Pat Duffy thing, this is just like Thrilla in Manila, I gotta tell you.  Yeah.  This is just amazing radio. 
[02:57:00]  Well, we got some...  Tony was giving us a list of things he's done.  It's just incredible.  It doesn't have to be a fight, Tony.  This thing is really escalating right in front of our eyes.  I don't know what to do next with this.  Oh, my God.  Tony, I want to know...  You are defending yourself.  You gotta list stuff.  I mean, but Pat does...  Let me tell you something.  On-air stuff is hard to top.  Pat's done...  Pat, do an on-air stunt today.  He's done a staple in the head.  He's done brushed teeth with dog shit.  He's done the fucking homeless mustache with dog shit.  Would you staple your nostrils together?  Yeah.  Yeah, let's do that.  That could be fun.  What? 
[02:57:30]  Why don't we shave that beard off?  Because everybody hates it.  And then you can eat that beard.  But I like it.  Yeah, but nobody likes it in the office.  Shave it off.  Nobody likes it.  Put it on a sandwich, and you get eaten.  Oh, thanks.  It's a great stunt for you.  Oh, yeah.  Riveting.  See, I'm writing for you.  Oh, thanks.  Eat a beard.  He's frustrated that, obviously, Pat does the big stunts.  Pat gets the attention.  Yeah.  Whereas he thinks he does more and better work, but he doesn't get the recognition because  it's behind the scenes. 
[02:58:00]  I'm not saying what he does on the air is not good for the show.  Of course, everybody knows it's good for the show.  It's great radio.  But I just think it's not, compared to the creative side of radio, it pales in comparison  because other people could do it.  Danny, thoughts?  Well, he's right in a sense because there are two different sides of radio.  There's the stunt boy side, and then there's the creative side, and I think that Pat Duffy  excels on the stunt boy side, and I think that Tony excels on the creative side. 
[02:58:30]  Don't I do a pretty good job for you on Saturday nights?  Well, you do, but you're not being creative.  Doesn't that count for something?  You're hitting buttons.  All right.  I appreciate your work ethic.  I think it's fantastic.  I've done 15 shows on a Saturday night.  Yeah, for Than and Sam, when have you come in for when I need you on a Saturday?  Oh.  Yeah, I'm here every Saturday.  Times are tough.  I had to sell my old man's copper wire to come here today.  Copper wire?  Well, I'm just saying, you managed to come in for every Than and Sam show, so I bet if 
[02:59:00]  I asked you to come in this Saturday for Laszlo, are you going to come in?  I'm busy this weekend.  I would.  I would if I wasn't doing anything.  Case closed.  You never asked me anymore.  I would.  All right.  Well, it's my birthday weekend and I'm coming in.  He doesn't come in often enough?  Huh?  He barely comes in for this show.  Who, Tony?  Yeah.  He's here like maybe one and a half day a week.  Well, I'm here two days a week.  At least this week I didn't come in because I didn't have any money.  I'm looking for a new job.  But other than that, I'm in Tuesday and Thursday.  That's enough time for me to create.  When you can.  You know? 
[02:59:30]  Well.  I know we don't have any interns.  I don't know why.  I'm not shitting on you.  I mean, I know you don't get paid and it's tough coming in here.  I mean, I was in the same boat that you were four years ago.  I was coming for free.  I was picking pennies out of my chick's pocketbook so I could get bus fare.  You know what I mean?  I was in the same boat.  No.  I understand.  I know what you mean.  But, you know, it just so happens that Pat Duffy can get here more often than you.  And sometimes in that kind of an environment, unfortunately, the FaceTime wins out over the guy  who's here twice a week.  Yeah.  We see Pat Duffy's face every morning.  Well, I mean, I come over here.  I can come to K-Rock. 
[03:00:00]  I can come in the studio.  I'll do a lap and then I can come back here.  This way everybody knows I'm here.  Sam threw his arms up in the air.  He's in his aspirations.  It's the ninth time we've told you to just come to CBS so people know you're here.  Yeah, but that's the thing.  It's a waste of the company's time for me to go over there and walk around for a little bit  and then come over there.  No, it's not.  It's not a waste of time for you to sit over there.  And if Jim needs coffee, then if I've got to wait another ten minutes.  Hold on.  I don't answer to you.  Don't tell me what the hell to do.  Wow.  Shut your face.  If everyone else gets to be suggesting, I'll listen, fine, but you be quiet. 
[03:00:30]  Tony, what is it that you're doing here that you can't do there?  Well, first of all, I did like 200 FU calls today.  That's first of all.  All right, but we have computers there.  Like, you can do stuff there.  I can't get on it.  There's no computers over there I can do it on.  Bullshit!  There's three different...  What'd I tell you?  Fucking Statsito over there.  Shut up.  I told fucking...  Wait, what did he say?  I told Derek that, you know, I'll do the FU calls or whatever, and he sets me up, and  it's done.  Quick.  Over there, everybody's booting me off the computer.  Because I can't get in the FU calls.  I don't have the password. 
[03:01:00]  What, they give you the password because you have shit on your head?  I don't have the password.  I don't have anything.  I got nothing in this place.  Wow.  Face right there.  Yeah.  That's a bit of a face.  A little bit.  Oh, the crowd's still chuckling.  Pat Duffy's getting angry.  Think honeybees.  Honeybees.  I know, right?  They're so cute honeybees.  You know what I'm going to do to them?  I'm going to go home.  I'm going to get a long stick.  I'm going to find, like, one of them little nests.  You're going to eat it?  I'm going to knock that fucking nest out of a tree. 
[03:01:30]  And them little tiny blue eggs.  I'm going to smash them.  All right.  Good for you.  Maybe I'll eat them like little blue M&M's.  I'll fucking eat them.  What, the honeybees have cute little blue eggs?  For some reason, honeybees have blue eggs.  Look at them stupid robins.  I know you like them even more than the bees.  I'm going to kill every robin nest they see this summer.  That's all for you.  So you think that he could be doing stuff over at CBS?  Like on the computer?  Yes.  Yes.  I didn't know that that was. 
[03:02:00]  There's no reason for him to just sit over here and claim that he can't go over to CBS.  There's plenty of computer studios over there.  I know.  Well, why would I go to that crowded ass office and be in everybody's way when I got a free computer over here?  Three computers.  Because there's other shit to be done over there while you're doing that work.  I've been doing work for Will.  Getting sandwiches?  Yes.  I've been working for Will.  That's why you're over there.  And then Jim needs coffee.  I'll go get Jim coffee.  Somebody else do something else.  I got Jim coffee last week.  My coffee was a better mix than yours.  Oh, God.  Jim, fuck you.  I never know who brings me the coffee.  It's just delicious every time.  Yeah.  Jim doesn't even know you're alive. 
[03:02:30]  That's just the reality of it, unfortunately.  No, I know Tony.  I know Tony.  I never know who's doing my coffee.  But I see Duffy more.  But that's right.  Danny's right.  What do you like better there, Jimmy?  I've gotten to know Duffy more.  But I like Tony.  But if I had to choose, look, on-air stuff to me is extraordinarily valuable.  But I have to say, I'm not aware of all the behind-the-scenes shit, for real.  Because I don't do production.  So, like, for me, audio just magically appears.  I don't see the hours of fucking hunting that goes into it.  Right.  So I'm aware of there's a lot of shit that goes on that I don't know how to do. 
[03:03:00]  I don't know how to do production.  All I just do is come here and I just brighten everybody's day.  I mean, I don't, like, does the sun know everything the sun does?  Of course not.  I shine here.  So as much as I'm partial to Duffy, I can't shit on what Tony does either.  Because there may be very valuable stuff I'm not aware of.  Said the wishy-washy faggot.  Oh, see that Derek's coming here with his gorgeous fuckable boy legs. 
[03:03:30]  Tattooed boy legs.  What's up, Derek?  What do you got on this?  What are you guys actually talking about?  Wow.  Just basically, Tony and Duffy are kind of having their whole thing again.  About who's more valuable and who does what.  I mean, you know, you see it all when Tony comes over here.  Tony helps me out a lot, actually, doing the FU calls.  If I'm working on a bit or something, I need something pulled from the internet.  I can tell him where to go and he'll grab me some audio, cut it up for me and give it to me on a CD.  What about Duffy? 
[03:04:00]  Duffy does the same thing, too.  So it's basically whichever one's around.  Tony does a little better job than Duffy in doing it, but.  Well, who would you rather see hired?  Point Tony.  Yeah, man, I don't know.  Why is it up to me?  I'm just curious.  Well, it kind of is, though.  Just an opinion.  Yeah.  That's perfect smile.  I mean.  I kind of have to go with Duffy on this one.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, no. 
[03:04:30]  Tony, what does that mean to you?  I don't know.  I guess it is what it is.  I figure if anybody can count on Derek.  See, Duffy can learn to do what you do in production and stuff, I think.  It can be taught.  But Duffy, the shit he's willing to do, that can't be taught.  That takes, like, a certain courage and retardation to be able to actually do that.  Yeah, bring him the staple gun. 
[03:05:00]  I want to see him staple his nostril today.  You got his staple gun?  What?  I just had a post-it from a fan, and he pointed at Derek, and it said, Mandels.  I'm not wearing fucking sneakers, man.  Jesus.  You're wearing Mandels?  No, man.  Not today.  Not today.  It's a little cold out.  It's raining.  Oh, okay.  Oh, he's not even wearing them?  No.  Because you, like, make fun of them.  Oh, okay.  Sorry, dude.  Hang my hopes up to see some fucking pterodactyl Derek toes.  Nothing to heartbreak.  People are suggesting a new Tony bit. 
[03:05:30]  Les A. from Chicago writes, new bit, environmentally unfriendly Tony.  I could do that.  You could do that, right?  Start today.  Destroy it in front of Tony.  In front of Pat.  In front of Pat.  A Robin's Nest would be a good start, I'm thinking.  I'll come up with something good.  Yeah, something really heinous to an environmentalist or something.  Yeah.  Can I say that Derek didn't say, like, fuck Tony?  He just said he thinks Duffy of the two.  He kind of said, beat a baby seal with a dolphin.  That would fucking kick ass, wouldn't it? 
[03:06:00]  I would like that, though.  Can you, like, staple your nostril?  Yeah, I'm waiting.  You want me to go?  I'm going to get the stapler right now.  Yeah.  See?  It's going to hurt, though.  Dude, that's bad.  Yeah, that is really bad.  No, you can't do that.  Go get the stapler, boy.  Go get it.  Go get the stapler, boy.  What?  Ooh.  He said, go get the stapler, boy.  But he said, like, you're a dog.  But he said, you're out of the studio, so you didn't hear him say that.  Oh, okay.  He said, go get the stapler, boy.  I'm not allowed to.  Who says you're not allowed to?  I just got yelled at by a bunch of people telling me not to.  Who's the bunch of people?  I just heard Danny. 
[03:06:30]  That was the one voice I heard.  He can't.  Dave, what are you doing, Steve?  I'm just making sure he can't staple his nostrils.  He can staple his nostrils?  Why can't he staple his nostrils?  Because I'm not taking him to the fucking emergency room again.  You don't have to.  Yeah, that's actually what I have to do when you hurt yourself intentionally, is take  you to the fucking emergency room, which I am not doing again, thank you very much.  Do not staple your fucking nose.  Wow.  Wait a minute.  Because you apparently didn't hear it the first fucking time you got told.  I have a bit that might work.  How about, this hurt me when I was a boy, and I don't know if it'll hurt you, but if you 
[03:07:00]  take freshen up toothpaste, and you take a dollop, and you rub it in your asshole.  All right.  Ow.  I have toothpaste in my backpack.  Oh, Steve's giving us a thumbs up on that.  Thanks, Steve.  Of course.  That's okay.  I have a brushy.  I do.  Give me stunt brain.  He'll bring Pat Duffy to the emergency room.  Where's the toothpaste?  Let's try that.  What kind do you have, though?  I have some.  I don't know.  It might not burn.  This might be a total bust.  But when I was a boy, and I was at Marvin Stoll's house, and my asshole was very sore,  though, because it was raw.  So this may not hurt. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah.  From a man's penis.  No.  Taking massive dumps.  I didn't wipe good enough.  Ew.  When I was a boy, I didn't wipe good enough.  That acid-y shit hanging there, burning away at your asshole.  I got a salt and vinegar chip in between my boyish cheeks.  All right.  What do you got, Pat Duffy?  I have...  Arm & Hammer Baking Soda Advanced White Toothpaste.  No.  That's not as...  Fresh it up.  You need that minty.  You need mint.  All right.  Well, this is what I had.  How about someone goes and gets fresh it up?  It's got to be right around the corner.  Because I'm the only intern here. 
[03:08:00]  Or Icy Hot.  That'll work, too.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  Let's do some Icy Hot.  Jimmy, you apply.  I will not.  It'll hurt my dick.  Swim walk.  Oh, no, you can't.  Oh, shit.  Motherfucker got a dick yoke in.  All right.  We're just being ridiculous today.  All right.  Well, if you'll do that.  Why not?  Why not?  All right.  You're in my fucking asshole.  Tony comment.  Thank you for that.  See, I don't...  Wait.  Tony has a comment, though.  Tony.  Tony, go ahead, bud.  Well, no.  I'm just waiting for the big thing.  That's all.  Here's the thing with this whole thing. 
[03:08:30]  I don't mind doing this, but this just cements Tony's point that I just do stunts.  Yeah, but people will be talking about Pat fucking Duffy, and in the end, that's all  we're looking for in the show.  Yeah, so it doesn't matter.  Cementing Tony's point or making your point are not relevant in the sense that what we look  for is what helps the show more.  That's the goal of all of us.  Right.  Like, again, I bring just my thing, and Opie and Anthony bring their thing.  Everyone brings their own thing to the show, so it doesn't matter if Tony's point is right  and your point is wrong. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  You understand what I'm saying?  No, I understand.  Like, right now, the listeners are listening to the show.  Right.  No.  Besides the battle of what I'm saying, they're waiting to hear something.  All right.  So Tony brought in his bit.  Okay.  He put a bit, Masterpiece did Rob do so there with Fat Bob Kelly.  So now you have to do a bit as well.  All right.  Well, before I do a stunt, I did bring another bit.  Can we try this first?  Oh, wow.  Can we try this first?  Yes, we can.  Which bit?  All right.  This is a list of botched executions that I found. 
[03:09:30]  I don't know if you want to read through them.  Oh, he's handing out freaking dinners and everything.  Worksheet.  Oh, wow.  And then I also have another list of the top 20 torture devices, but I picked out my favorites.  Oh, wow.  Look at this.  Oh, wow.  Now, I don't know what you guys can do with them, but I thought that it was interesting.  Hold on now.  I wouldn't say this is a bit as much as I would put the asterisk next to it and call it a food for thought. 
[03:10:00]  It's material, yeah.  It's just something to read through and hopefully we are talented enough to make it sound good.  Yeah, you can't just lob up softball at the gifted ones.  Well, what would you do with this, personally?  Well, for example, what I would do with them is just the descriptions of these torture devices. 
[03:10:30]  We're enough to cause, you know, cringe factor all over anybody that's listening.  Yeah.  Anybody that can...  Oh, it's you.  I can't.  I'm sweating.  It's you.  Well, I don't want to read any.  Why?  That's your bit.  That's your bit, Pat.  You can't read?  You're not just a stunt guy.  You don't just hand dittos out.  I know, but I don't know what to do with it.  Enjoy it.  Seriously, I'm not fucking with you.  Tony did his thing.  No, I'm not.  He produced it and he did the thing, so he's saying that you can't.  So enjoy it.  Whatever.  Just talk about it.  Did I just say clicking print is not creating?  I can look up stories all day long. 
[03:11:00]  I can open up a Snapple cap, get a nice fact, and bring it to the boys and they can talk  about it for a second.  Whoa.  You know.  What's wrong, Pat?  Do that.  Nothing.  There's no way I'm going to win in a war of war.  You want me to read it?  I'll read it.  Give me that thing.  I'll fucking read it.  What the fuck are you laughing at?  What are you funny?  It's a comedy show.  Oh, shit.  It's funny.  It's a comedy show.  Why are you getting mad, Pat?  I'm just getting...  I'm not.  Why?  Do you say why? 
[03:11:30]  Jimmy, throw something at Pat.  I'm not mad at Pat.  I love Pat.  Sam, throw something at Pat.  That's what happens.  No, I don't want Pat mad at me.  I'm going to eat yogurt soon.  Just watch this show.  Sam.  Sam.  Oh, boy.  I'll throw my camera.  Sam, you of all people know that I want to fucking kill you.  Yeah.  So just stop.  Why?  Why do you want to kill Sam?  Well, I don't.  I don't see the rationale in me stopping because it's starting to get good. 
[03:12:00]  Alan Lee Davis, Electrocution.  Before he was pronounced dead, the blood from his mouth had poured onto the collar of his  white t-shirt, and the blood on his chest has spread to about the size.  Holy shit, it's going to be death in this studio.  I've never seen, sorry, I've never seen Pat in, like, I've never, he's all right. 
[03:12:30]  He's really mad.  Pat, control it.  I want to see you control it for once.  All right.  That's, you know.  The size of a dinner plate.  Even oozing through.  Control it.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We're doing some therapy with Pat.  Go ahead.  Throw another one, Sam.  Control it.  Control it.  Control it.  That's just humiliating the guy.  Control it.  Control it.  So far, so good.  What did he throw at him? 
[03:13:00]  Remote control.  Oh.  The whole show with Colin?  Did he hit you?  Yeah.  Where?  Did it hurt?  Did it hurt you?  Yeah, it's a remote.  Are you okay?  Yeah, I'll be fine.  Pat, you got to control that shit.  Fuck.  Oh my God.  What happened?  What did he throw?  He just, again, hit him in the top of the head with a newspaper. 
[03:13:30]  It's a newspaper.  Somehow Pat Duffy thinks I'm going to listen to him instead of Opie.  I don't know where Pat Duffy gets his entitlement from, but.  Oh.  The listeners are coming up with bits now.  Eileen from Brooklyn.  Five most horrifying bugs in the world.  See?  We can read that list next.  Oh, cool.  Okay.  I'm so fucking mad right now.  Oh my God.  Why?  Why the anger? 
[03:14:00]  Because what the fuck?  People are throwing stuff at me.  Yeah, but we're like teaching you.  You gotta control that shit.  Hit me with a piece of paper.  That's fucking hilarious.  Do I have a problem with it?  You're kidding.  That was funny.  All right, do the same thing to Pat now.  Ha ha, that was funny.  Why don't you like that?  Oh, fuck.  Ha ha.  What's that?  Someone do that to you when you were a kid?  You really don't like that.  People have been doing it to me since the second I was born.  I'm fucking tired of it.  Throwing stuff at you?  I don't know.  Yeah, you don't like being picked on.  No. 
[03:14:30]  At all.  Oh, that gets better every time.  It's unbelievable.  It's a square in his face, too.  Pat's not having any of it.  I don't want to break this up, but I got Snapple cap facts.  A goldfish's attention span is only three seconds.  It's fucking crazy, right?  You can pick it up, mess with it, and put it down, and then you forgot what happened. 
[03:15:00]  You're so right, Tony.  You're so right.  You know, animals, the animals that lay eggs, they don't even have belly buttons.  It's crazy.  What?  Yeah.  What's that all about?  What's that all about, right?  Nope.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's a great fact.  You guys done digressing?  I'll move on.  I got plenty of them.  I think there's a factoids.  Just hit Pat with another piece of paper.  Who do you have?  Sam.  No.  It bounced off past that. 
[03:15:30]  Pat could control himself, though.  Pat's fine.  Yeah.  Do another one.  Do another one.  Oh.  That's annoying.  It's tossing around his fucking head.  All right.  Do one to Tony, though.  I'm kind of in the middle reading a bit.  I know, but...  Oh, jeez.  Crazy, Sam.  He's a character.  You're like, Sam.  He's throwing stuff at people.  Pat doesn't like this.  He's being abused by Sam with the paper, and he's not, like, in the limelight here.  No, but Pat also... 
[03:16:00]  Being outshined by Tony a little bit.  Yeah.  This is fine.  But Pat knows that he does crazy things, and he loves doing that, but he also knows  that, like, he has thoughts, and he has, like, things that he wants to do that are  not crazy, and he feels like he's not being taken seriously, and he feels like he brought  something to the table bit-wise, and he's just being mocked, and kind of, like, shit's  being lobbed at him.  It's a good bid.  We did this at AAF 10 years ago.  He feels like, oh, this is my lot in life.  That's a compliment.  I'm just kidding.  I mean, like, kind of accurate with that?  Like, it's not being...  You feel like you bring something in, and you want it to at least be addressed seriously 
[03:16:30]  on some level.  Yeah, I guess.  I mean, I don't know.  This is really uncomfortable for me.  Why is that uncomfortable?  Because I just want to leave right now.  No, just get up and leave.  Put something in your ass, you'll feel right at home.  Oh, I see you now.  That's, you know.  You feel fine.  Pat, that was bad.  Well.  No, I'm just trying to make it feel comfortable.  I didn't mean that, like, disrespectfully.  Forgive me if I, you know, if it came off that way. 
[03:17:00]  It's right out of paper.  Oh, shit.  Throw one more thing.  Throw one more thing.  Let's see.  Wow.  Should I do it?  Can you duck fast?  Duffy's holding a fucking Time Warner remote, and I don't think he wants to change the...  Do you think he wants to change the channel?  Sam asks.  He's sucking the remote controls.  Sam asks.  Can I do it?  Is that what you said? 
[03:17:30]  Should I do it?  Should I do it?  It's up to you.  See what kind of balls you have, too, my friend.  It's up to you, kid.  It's up to you.  You want to be guy that could have or guy that did?  Jimmy's in the line of fire there.  It's fine.  All right.  As fucking Poe steps in, and you run behind Steve.  Oh, my God.  Boo.  What is that?  Boo.  Why is Poe's in it?  Are these all right?  Prime time socks.  He's executive producer. 
[03:18:00]  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, that's something you want here.  Don't show me.  Duffy just lunged after Sam and had to be subdued by Master Poe.  He looked like he wanted to kill.  Did you see the face?  He was just rage.  Wow.  Pure rage.  Wow, Sam.  You are fucked, man.  That guy could rip you to pieces. 
[03:18:30]  I don't know what happened.  He can rip you to pieces.  He threw a stapler at Sam's head.  Was that a stapler?  Yes.  I don't know if it was a stapler.  It was the remote.  Remote.  And then Sam decided that he needed to hit him one more time.  Yeah, that was, it was too wimpy of a throw.  No, no, no, no, no.  Duffy's, wow.  Oh, he's just broke.  Holy shit.  What did he do?  No, I gotta go talk to him.  I think he's taking out the recycling.  He just kicked a bunch of shit.  He just went down the stairs.  I don't know what, Pat's got like a very short temper. 
[03:19:00]  He certainly does.  He's very short-tempered, Pat.  And I don't think he can take like that kind of abuse.  Yeah, man.  I thought he could go with the bit.  But other people can do that.  He takes it very seriously.  Pat doesn't play games.  Dude, if he got a hold of you, you were getting punched so bad in the face.  He was definitely hitting you.  He was fighting back trying to get away from Poe.  Poe put him in like a choke hold.  Yeah, I would have bled a lot. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, yeah, you'd have been bleeding.  We'd have probably had to call an ambulance for you.  Pat Duffy.  I never saw that side of Pat.  But he always seems like a fun guy.  The minute you walked in, you could see that that's there.  It's in the eyes, man.  It's in the face.  Really?  Yes, of course.  I just thought he kind of looked like that.  He's a guy that doesn't play games, but he's not a tough guy.  He's not like a shithead.  But he's a guy that will try to avoid confrontation.  Right, right.  I don't see him as starting fights going out.  No, no, no, no.  He's not like that.  You ever seen him drunk? 
[03:20:00]  No.  I wonder if he gets drunk and decides,  I'm going to kick that guy's ass or something.  You seem like a problem, like with anybody.  I'm the nicest guy to drink with ever.  I just don't start anything.  I'll finish it, but I never start with anybody.  No, you seem like a troublemaker.  No, me?  A little bit, yeah.  You seem like a guy that if I went to school with you or something,  you'd hit me.  Nah, you could push me really far before I even think about snapping. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah.  I'm a pretty cool and calm collector.  They beat me up for two hours straight on their show,  and I go with it and have fun with it.  We've thrown a lot at Tony in the past couple of years, yes.  Danny, is there a report on...  No, there isn't.  It reminded me of...  Do you guys remember our old intern, Craig?  Oh, yes.  Yeah, he told me a story once where we got him so mad one day  that when he got back to his car, he punched his window in.  He had to get a new window.  What a bunch of pricks. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, I think it was you.  I think that was when you poured water all over him.  We are just a bunch of douchebags  because you know everyone wanted that to happen.  But not to that extent.  Oh, yes, to that extent.  I wanted to see Sam get punched in the face.  No, I don't like Sam.  Why wouldn't you want to see that?  Because I like Sam.  It doesn't matter.  I like Pat enough where I don't want to see Sam get hurt  or I don't want to see Pat have to be asked to not come back.  That would have ruled to say...  That would have been...  You're right.  I don't like the consequences. 
[03:21:30]  That probably would have happened afterwards.  But to see that animal get up like that  because his face was just rage  and attack Sam and punch him in the head.  As long as there was someone to pull him off me  before there was any permanent damage,  it would so be worth it.  And then Sam would be one of those smartasses  that would get up with blood coming out of his nose and mouth  and then pick a paper and throw it right at his face again.  I don't know about that.  Sam, when's the last time you were truly decked?  I've never been in a fight in my life.  Oh, okay.  That would be a lesson teacher. 
[03:22:00]  Like how this does happen.  Oh, wow.  So when you're an asshole to people,  you get this ringing sensation in your ears  and things go black for a while.  I don't know.  Yeah, you don't know.  You're going to find out if you keep doing shit like that.  Especially Duffy's meat paw.  Duffy, let me tell you something.  Fucking roast beef on a stick.  Oh, boy.  Hope's back.  Sam, you should have took one for the home team here.  Where's he going?  Just taking one?  Yeah, you should have just took one.  He's all right.  What do you think?  Visit HR?  What's going on?  Nah, nah. 
[03:22:30]  Nah, he's fine.  He's never rat, right?  He goes to another place, man.  He's not leaving, is he?  No.  We talked him into coming back up.  All right.  He goes to another place, though.  You see it in his eyes.  Yeah.  He's somewhere else.  He's a problem.  Pat, you can't fuck with Pat.  He's a guy who's fucking,  like you said,  this has happened his whole life.  He's had a lot of bullshit.  And he's just a guy that doesn't fucking,  he snaps.  He has a problem with you.  Yeah, I know.  Why, though?  I don't know.  I think he probably had a lot of smartasses  that picked on him. 
[03:23:00]  He doesn't like when, like.  But he really has a problem with you,  not just from today.  No, he has a problem with me from before.  Because Pat's like,  he's smart,  but he comes up with lines  to come back at somebody,  like,  an hour after it happened.  So he'll be in the car,  and he'll think of a good line  that could have come back.  So he doesn't like it,  in general.  Because it's not like this is the first time  The jerk store called.  Well, hold on.  Wait, now.  Can we have, uh,  can we have Pat and Sam just talk?  No, throwing shit at him.  But just talk.  I'm willing to talk.  Where's Pat?  Would Pat want to talk to him 
[03:23:30]  if he doesn't fuck around?  I don't want to see Pat  snap and get in trouble.  He can't take a ribbing.  Like, I mean,  that's the reason I survived here.  A ribbing.  He didn't take a ribbing.  But he can take a lot.  I mean, I gotta stick up for Duffy.  He fucking puts up with a lot of shit.  I want someone in between us, though.  He's gotta be on the other side of the room.  No, he won't charge if you just fucking,  just don't throw shit at him.  Look at Sam now.  Now the pussy side of Sam is coming through.  I want him over there.  I know.  Sam, you alright?  A little nervous, huh?  No, I'm good.  Yeah, Pat's a fucking, you know. 
[03:24:00]  This guy ripped his head off.  Facing the tiger.  Now, Pat,  we didn't know you had a problem with Sam before, obviously.  Yeah.  Now, what's going on with that?  He reminds you of what?  No, it's just like,  no matter where you go in your life,  it doesn't matter what you do,  there's always gonna be one person  that's gonna fuck with you,  and that's Sam here for me.  From day one,  Sam's been fucking with me.  But is he fucking with you  like a buddy fucks with somebody,  or is he fucking with you  in a way that he's kind of like,  you think he's testing your manhood?  Literally, he's fucking him in the ass.  It's terrible. 
[03:24:30]  He doesn't like it.  I feel that,  I just feel,  I don't know.  Yeah, but Pat,  they do it to me,  every guy,  like Danny will walk up  instead of being like,  he hasn't seen me in a week,  how you doing?  He'll be like,  get out of my seat,  you fat fuck.  You know, like,  like on a Monday.  You know, it's just,  That was just whatever.  Deceit-ass Danny to say something.  Boo.  Sorry, guys.  Slow killing.  But you know what?  Some people can handle that crap  and others can't,  and I think it depends  on how you were brought up,  and it seems like this brings  Pat Duffy back to a place 
[03:25:00]  that was uncomfortable for him.  But to like re-array what Tony said,  like, everybody else fucks  with everybody around here.  Like, Danny will say the same shit to me,  or Than will fuck,  Than fucked with me so bad recently,  and then,  but like,  when it comes to Sam,  it just,  it gets real.  He does it like he's doing it real  to like actually insult you,  and I can't fucking take it sometimes.  He's just good at it,  I think.  Yeah, people think I'm insulting.  I don't care about people,  so I'm not insulting anybody.  It doesn't matter to me,  but I just say things,  like,  I do like to mess with people's minds, 
[03:25:30]  and so like,  I will say things that I know  that Pat Duffy will take to heart,  because he's very sensitive.  What is something he would take to heart?  Don't say it to him necessarily,  but what is something  he would take to heart?  No, I'm serious.  Like,  not necessarily like the insult,  but is it about you call him dumb  or you call him ugly?  He doesn't have picked on before.  Yeah,  he really doesn't like it  when people call him dumb or stupid.  Like,  even if you say that was a stupid thing to do,  or like,  you know,  Pat,  the word stupid,  I think it's some kind of trigger for him,  because he hates being called stupid.  Where does that come from?  Pat,  yeah. 
[03:26:00]  I think it comes from,  I worked for this guy for a little while,  and everything that I did,  no matter what,  I was fucking,  I was stupid,  and I don't like being called stupid.  Do you feel like you are,  or do you feel like you're just...  No, I feel like I'm quite the opposite.  I'm not stupid at all,  but it's just,  it's hard for me to just say,  like I heard him say before,  it's hard for me to just be quick on my feet verbally,  but I don't think,  and I come off as dumb.  Like,  sitting there before,  when I was told to explain what I brought,  I couldn't,  because I just can't think of the way to make it interesting, 
[03:26:30]  you know what I mean?  Yeah,  exactly.  It's like Marty McFly with chicken.  No, but you're not though,  you panic,  you tend to worry about,  instead of just doing what you gotta do,  you're worrying about how it's gonna be interpreted,  stop worrying about the results,  like the results are beyond your control.  When I was talking to him in the stairwell,  he said to me,  I'm sorry that you didn't like the bit,  and I had explained to him,  it's not even about the bit he handed us,  because we had something else going on.  Our whole goal there was to get you to fucking react, 
[03:27:00]  that we did our jobs there.  We wanted the big,  holy shitty,  fucking turn into Hulk moment.  The worst thing you could have done,  was brought a well-produced bit.  Nobody wanted to hear that.  Who cares?  Not at that moment,  anyway.  You could have given us the greatest radio bit ever.  It didn't matter,  because of the timing of the whole thing.  Our whole goal was to get some kind of interaction going,  between you and Tony,  or,  well,  and then eventually Sam,  obviously.  I didn't know you and Sam had a thing,  I didn't know that.  We didn't even look at this bit, 
[03:27:30]  because we're like,  yeah,  alright,  it looks like it could be something good for the show,  but we were in the middle of just trying to get you to fucking lose your mind.  And also,  I had this shit on the bit,  because when you look at it,  fucking,  fucking Tony,  we broke down to 20 good seconds a day.  We don't have to go back to that,  we already did all of them.  We basically covered the fucking,  you know,  the fucking nonsense he's been fucking passing off.  And let it be known,  fat,  out of all the interns that have ever been here,  every one of them hated you,  and you hated them,  and what did you say about me?  I like you, 
[03:28:00]  Tony.  Exactly.  See,  and,  because yeah,  I do it in a fucking regular way,  I don't even bust balls,  I just come in and do my thing.  So let it be known that,  you know,  whatever happens,  I'm the one you liked,  besides all these other fuckers.  All the interns that are gone,  you hated them.  Yeah.  And they hated your guts.  Yeah.  See,  I'm the only one who doesn't fuck with you,  that's why you like me.  You just,  you just never hear.  I'm getting a hard time getting fucked with people.  Wait,  so you guys actually like each other?  I have no problem with Tony,  but if Tony thinks for a second  that he should be hired before me,  he's full of fucking shit. 
[03:28:30]  I don't know.  This segment kind of.  If you guys like each other,  how about a man-on-man kiss?  No,  I don't necessarily like him,  it's just that I don't fucking.  What happened?  Jimmy?  You don't like him?  I don't fucking hate him,  but I don't like him.  Put it that way.  It is what it is.  I don't fuck with him,  he don't fuck with me,  and that's the end of it.  On the outside,  who would you say immediately,  just on looks,  has the more friendly look?  Who do you think, Jimmy? 
[03:29:00]  It's hard to say, man,  because I see Duffy more,  so I know he's a good dude.  Duffy looks way friendlier.  In a way, yeah.  When he's not like that.  He's in another world right now.  Yeah,  I'm with the bees right now.  Tony looks scary,  just when he's just doing his,  you know,  just walking around, man.  I would say the friendlier one.  Duffy has an innocence about him,  and I think that's why  he does the Amish beard  and everything fucking else.  He's like trying to,  trying to make himself look tougher.  You could also see me.  I know you could rip someone's head off,  I'm not even going to fucking play. 
[03:29:30]  That's obvious.  But I think inside,  there's like a,  an innocent,  a very innocent boy.  There's just a little boy in there.  Yeah.  I have no doubt about it.  Doesn't want to be fucked with.  Yeah.  So what could Sam do to make things,  like, you know,  like, I didn't know you guys,  like, who do you dislike the most?  Sam.  Oh, Jesus.  No, Sam,  Sam's not going to change,  because Sam is Sam,  and Sam is really good for the show,  and what me and Sam have  shouldn't change.  It's fine,  but it's not going to,  it's not going to change.  Do you like Fan?  Yeah, I do like Fan.  Fan got me so bad, though, 
[03:30:00]  recently.  Ah, sorry.  Yeah, I don't know.  What happened there?  Do you like E-Rock?  Yeah, I do a lot of work for Eric.  I'm not sure you said  you do all his work.  Well, yeah.  Stop trying to make up.  Stop trying to call back  fun Pat moments.  Put a nice bed under it.  Yeah.  You doing all right now, Pat?  Yeah, I'm a lot better than I was.  We don't want you running out  of the building and...  I wasn't quitting, though.  I was just...  No, but you're just running out  like a fucking, like,  King Kong,  leaving the fucking...  I was going to attack  the first person on the sidewalk. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah, that would have been great.  Someone walking in the building  gets strangled by Pat.  Probably the same guy  that had mustard poured on him.  Shit.  The unlucky...  No one ever had  mustard poured on him.  Are you crazy?  That was a hell of a shot, though.  I thought that was  across the street.  It was wonderful.  It was raining mustard  on that guy.  But Sam just rubs you  the wrong way.  Yeah.  Because you think...  Is it that he's kind of shit...  Like, he fucks with you 
[03:31:00]  not understanding  that the consequences are real.  Yeah, like, I don't think...  I think Sam fucks  with everybody the same.  Like, I don't think Sam  singles me out.  But I think that Sam...  I just take it from Sam  a lot differently  than other people do.  Yeah, that's what it is.  Pat's off.  He's the most emotional  of the interns.  That's also why he can't  think of stuff  with a snap of a finger  because if you say something  that hurts his feelings,  instead of just being methodical  and thinking of a comeback,  his feelings are hurt.  So his emotions...  He's just got all this rage  in him that wants to come out.  So when I start shitting on him, 
[03:31:30]  the rage comes out  and then he can't do  anything about it  because he can't hit anyone here.  Right.  I think you two ought  to shake hands.  I say a hug.  Not a fag hug.  Just a little...  Finish this whole thing.  Yeah.  A little handshake.  I'm thinking a  bare-chested hug.  Bare-chested?  Yeah, what?  What?  Why not?  What's wrong with you guys  bare-chested?  Wait a minute.  That bare-chested's okay.  Yeah, what are you guys,  a bunch of homophobes?  Relax.  A little bare-chested hug.  I'll squeeze the life  out of him.  Yeah, I don't think I'm going to hug. 
[03:32:00]  You can't hug him too hard.  I would probably try  to break his spine.  I don't want to be close to him.  That's why you both  are bare-chested  because then it's silly.  Tony knows.  Just a handshake.  I don't want to be close to him.  How about just a quick handshake?  Handshake's fine.  He gets makeup like men.  Men do.  Let's see how close...  But it's not...  I am sorry.  I didn't mean to...  Hold on.  I'm not even going for  another reaction.  I just want to,  for my own benefit,  I want to see...  You both start the  opposite sides of the room  and I want to see  how close you can get  before Pat Duffy  can't get any closer.  That's all I'm asking for now. 
[03:32:30]  I'm not asking for  a strangulation or any of that.  And Master Pole  will be close just in case.  So everyone is safe.  I'll be straight.  I don't...  Out of fear of Sam's safety,  I don't want to be close to him.  Right now.  That's legit.  Like, you don't know  if you'll just clock him.  Like, no,  because if I get close  and Sam shoots me  some fucking dumb smile,  I just...  Oh, yeah,  he probably would.  That's fair.  Have you ever fantasized  about punching?  Yes, I would gleefully  break my hands  on Sam's face.  I've thought about it  so many times.  Wow.  Really?  Oh, my God.  You had a lot of Sam's 
[03:33:00]  in your life growing up.  Where exactly  would you hit him first?  First?  First punch.  First thing I would do,  I'd hit him right in the chest  so that he got stepped back  and he didn't know what to do.  And when he leans forward  because of his chest,  I would hit him twice  in the face like that  and then that would  knock him down.  I'd get him on the ground.  I'd put my knees  over his shoulders.  And I would literally punch  until my fist hit pavement  through his skull.  I would fucking kill him  in a second.  Would you do an  American History X  put his mouth on a curb?  Absolutely.  Bite the fucking curb.  Absolutely. 
[03:33:30]  Wow.  Wow.  Actually, a little tension  between you.  I thought about it.  Might be a little problem.  And now what would you do,  Sam,  against Pat Duffy?  Well, if me and Pat Duffy  were to fight,  I would probably get  punched in the chest  and then I would  lean my head forward  and get punched  twice in the face.  That's damn funny.  And then I would  end up dying.  No, no, no, no.  No, I wouldn't kill you.  I would beat you  to within an inch  of your life  so that for the rest  of your life,  the next time you would  fuck with somebody,  you thought about it. 
[03:34:00]  You thought about the consequences.  Wait, wait, wait.  Maybe you can put  a quartering by horses  number 13  on your bed.  Oh, boy.  Oh, this is just ugly.  That's wrong.  That was bad.  Does this worry you  when he's saying,  like, did you know  that he had this level  of animosity for you?  Yes, I did.  So why do you  still fuck with him?  Why would you  throw papers at his face?  I thought that  we were just getting along.  Like, I thought  he was going to be  like this time.  You know,  he's finally going to see  I'm just playing with him 
[03:34:30]  because I want to be  his friend.  Like, I thought  maybe I just  because I throw  the papers at Tony  and he's like,  oh, Sam's throwing  papers at me.  We're just playing around.  Sam's cheeks are  awfully rosy today.  What's that about?  You can't help it.  Both races  fighting to get out.  Wow.  I don't like the way  you all left me  hanging on that one.  It hurts.  You guys,  maybe they need to  watch a chick flick  together or something.  You guys need to do  something to get  this anger out.  My ways of making friends  is not working. 
[03:35:00]  Making friends?  Sam, take a step  toward Pat Duffy.  One step.  Yeah, because you guys  can't have any violence  towards each other.  You can't work together.  You can't have that.  Tell me what you're  feeling, Pat.  Sam is taking one step  toward you.  He's a good 15 to 20 feet  away.  I'd say 15 feet away.  How are you feeling  right now?  I feel like I'm just  waiting for him to do  something that's just  going to fuck with me  the whole time over here.  But so far, okay  with him a little closer.  Yeah, I'm all right.  It's fine.  Sam, take one more step.  One more step.  All right, now you're  about, I don't know, 
[03:35:30]  12 feet away from Pat.  I'd freak out, though.  I can't just, I can't  because I won't get hired.  I can't just freak out.  Does he embarrass you a lot?  Yes!  That's what we're getting at.  You can't freak out.  I know.  This is a lesson.  A life lesson.  So why put me in a  position to freak out?  Calm all, calm all.  Deep breath, deep breath,  deep breath, okay?  Breathe, breathe.  Let's see you breathing.  I'm fine.  I'm breathing.  All right, Sam, take  another step.  All right, one more step.  I'm not doing anything.  I've got no paper balls,  no nothing.  Sam is a little... 
[03:36:00]  You do have paper balls.  Paul, he's got his  hands in his pocket.  Let it be known that  Sam's a little nervous  right now.  All right, Sam's about  10 feet away from Pat.  Because he just described  what he's going to do to him.  It wasn't good.  He wants to kill him,  or not kill him,  but beat him.  Believe me, by the way,  he'd be dead.  I know.  You'd be like,  oh, I didn't mean to kill him.  I just meant to beat him  within an inch of his life,  but then my ruler broke.  How's your fist  going to get to the pavement  without passing through  his brain?  Yeah.  He needs that to live, Pat. 
[03:36:30]  Thanks for picking that apart.  Sure.  Yeah.  People are calling Tony  the callback king today,  by the way.  The callback king  sitting in with us.  Oh, yeah.  Sam, one more step  toward Pat.  Pat, what do you feel is...  One more friendly step.  He's within 10 feet of you now.  How do you feel?  I'm imagining the next 10 minutes  of my head,  and I just...  I don't think Sam's brave enough  to say anything crazy.  He's just walking toward you.  That's all that's going on.  Oh, that's it, Poe.  Kick the papers  that he was throwing  at his head.  I have nothing to lose. 
[03:37:00]  You have stuff to lose.  You can go to jail.  You can lose your job.  You got plenty to lose.  Wow, listen to how he's  threatening you  with legal fucking shit.  Oh, Sam will be immediately  sue guy.  Immediately.  Yeah.  Yeah, well,  I'm not going to punch you back.  I'm going to take the phone  out of it.  I'm weak.  All right, one more step, Sam.  Let's see.  Just one more step.  The steps are getting  smaller by Sam.  It needs to be noted.  Yes.  They were big strides  when this little game  of chicken started. 
[03:37:30]  I was much further away before.  Pat, how are you doing now?  I'm fine.  I don't like the security  coming in as well.  No, I don't mind that.  Oh, just in case.  For your own safety,  how many feet away  are you there, Pat?  I'd say like eight feet.  All right.  Sam, how about another step?  All right, I'm going  one more step, Pat.  All right.  We're good.  Oh, that was a really small step.  Half a step.  Half a step.  That was a step.  That was a...  Yeah, that was an ST.  Very good, Jimmy.  Sam, are you worried?  Yeah.  What are you worried about? 
[03:38:00]  How many feet away  are they, E-Rock?  Face to face,  how many feet?  About six or seven feet  from each other.  For anyone that thinks  that you can't live  without a brain.  Or apparently a footy guy.  It was too far away.  Should we do another step, Sam?  I don't know.  I mean, we kind of  made the point, right?  Sam, what's your fear?  If Poe weren't there,  I would be a lot more nervous. 
[03:38:30]  And I saw Poe very ably,  as you know,  he should take Pat  out of the equation.  Pat without hurting him, I hope.  All right, one more.  How about we try one more step?  We're trying to get  a breakthrough here  because you guys  got to work together  on some level.  Yes.  I would like a handshake.  Sam, how about another step?  One more step.  Well, that was almost  a full step.  Sam, how far away  would you say you are  from death?  Just out of his reach.  Yeah, probably four feet.  Yeah, just out of his reach.  I'm thinking about maybe  taking a half step back. 
[03:39:00]  No.  Oh, no.  This is a lesson  for Sam, too, I'm thinking.  Oh, Pat's moved his hands now.  I don't know  what to do with my hands.  Wow, you're like me  in an acting scene.  Yeah.  Actually, put him  around Sam's throat.  No, you don't have to do that.  He's just kidding around.  Do we have another step  in us, I'm wondering, Sam?  Well, I'm so close.  I mean, I don't think...  Well, this is where  it's got to, you know,  Pat's got to do  the right thing,  and let's do it.  Oh, what are you doing?  He's stepping.  Let's do one more step there. 
[03:39:30]  Okay, we're going  one more step.  Oh, my God.  That was close enough  where...  Wow.  That was four inches, Sam.  Yeah, but now  we're pretty much  within each other's reaches.  You've been a wise-ass  to this kid for a while.  I mean, the least you can do  is, like, be brave enough  to take a step toward him.  How do you figure?  Because we told Pat  he can't touch you.  Yeah, but you could tell  people a lot of things.  Pat, what are you feeling  right now?  Sam is very close to you.  He's less than four feet  away from your face.  I feel like Sam's got  that fucking smile  on his face.  Like, I knew he was 
[03:40:00]  going to have it.  I'm straight-faced.  A million-dollar smile.  This is no bit.  I think Sam is a little  scared right now.  Why do you think  you're scared of me?  I just admitted  that you would kill me.  I'm not going to...  I would never have  a physical confrontation  with you, Pat.  You don't think Sam  is scared of you, Pat?  No.  Oh, my God.  We need to find  a psychologist.  Just start making  chicken noises, Sam.  Yeah, you have to  understand, Pat.  On the street,  on the sidewalk,  I wouldn't dare  fuck with you. 
[03:40:30]  But here,  there are levels  of protection  that protect me  from physical confrontation.  The only way  that you would fuck with me  is because  Paul was standing  in front of you.  Yes!  What if Paul was  looking the other way  or was sick that day?  If Paul was sick today,  I wouldn't be standing  this close to Pat Duffy.  Hey, Pat, see?  Does that help you  out a little bit?  Why do you need  Sam to be afraid of you?  Because you feel like  you can't battle  with him verbally,  so you need  some feeling  of empowerment.  He has to know,  Sam should know  that I'm a man  and there are  consequences for him 
[03:41:00]  doing this.  I want to get this  like it's a press conference  for a prize fight.  Let's get a little closer.  That's comforting,  Paul.  We got the shot.  Sam, I think  you got another  step in you.  Well, if you want  to do the picture,  we could just put it  on Panorama  and kind of just stay.  How about another  step there, Sam?  What do you think, Pat?  Should we go one more step?  Go for it, Sam.  This is, you know...  I'm going up to  Poe's shoe.  There you go.  Watch his legs!  Okay.  All right, what's going on 
[03:41:30]  over there, Tony?  They're really getting  really close.  Poe's got one foot  in between them.  I don't think Poe  needs to have a foot  in between them, though.  He's feeling his chest.  Poe, back up a second.  Yeah, Paul, I don't think  you...  Pat, you're not going  to charge him for just...  He's not going to charge him,  Poe.  Let's all back up.  No, no, no, no, no.  Why are you backing up?  Back up.  He's not going to charge him.  Pat, how are you feeling now?  I'm all right.  I'm all right.  So you don't always have  to, like, solve things  with, like, fists  and punching and anger.  That's why we're doing this.  It, like, shows that,  you know, you're a reasonable fella. 
[03:42:00]  Well, I have to be...  This humongous is a reasonable man.  Jimmy, should we go  for another step?  Um, well, how far apart are they?  I can't really see.  They're about four feet.  I'll say three feet.  Three feet.  Pat, very carefully  so you don't scare Sam.  Put your arm all the way out.  Oh.  All right, all right.  We're good.  We're good.  All right.  See, Pat's showing  a little humor, Sam.  Sam almost shitted pants.  I was just screwing  with him a little bit.  Yeah, see, Duffy did  a big, huge step forward  right into Sam's face.  Yeah, Opie said, arm out, 
[03:42:30]  and Pat Duffy said, body out.  Yes.  And went the whole way.  But Pat's showing that,  look, I can play too a little bit.  He was having a little fun,  right, Pat?  A little bit.  A little bit?  Gotta get something.  So, Sam, what would you like  to say to Pat, for real?  Like, not, you know,  because you know  you've been fucking with him  and you see it's been  getting to him on a real level,  like, not a fun level.  Yes.  Pat, I have no vested interest  in hurting you, mentally.  I couldn't hurt you physically.  All right.  And that's it.  Sam, now that you're  real close to Pat,  like, explain what your motive is. 
[03:43:00]  Is your motive to drive  Pat Duffy insane  or just to have a little fun?  Or to push buttons  of someone that...  That hair just drive you crazy, Pat.  Would you love to just see  blood coming out of it?  And it would.  It wouldn't even get on the hair.  It would just pour out  from under it.  Yeah.  Because it's an afro,  so you'd just see the afro,  and then slowly the blood  would come down the sides  of his head.  Is this on Pal Talk?  Out of his ears.  People are wondering  if this is...  Oh, of course it is.  All right.  How about,  let's just see how close we get.  And then we just count out 
[03:43:30]  like 10, 20 seconds,  and then this bit will be over.  Okay.  All right, Sam.  Turn your hat around  so you get real close.  All right.  Thanks, Tony.  All right, Sam.  He actually did like a reliever.  How about your shoes  kind of touch?  As close as that.  How about our shoes  touch Master Poe's shoe?  No.  Sam, you know what would be  really funny?  What?  If you threw paper  at his face right now.  No.  You remember that, Pat?  Yeah, I do.  Like minutes ago  when he was just  throwing paper at your face.  I blacked most of it out.  How annoying that was. 
[03:44:00]  How about we get really close  to end the bit?  We don't really have  a good ending to the bit yet.  Sam, a little step forward.  I got an idea.  All right, a little step.  Here we go.  Pat, you do a little step.  All right.  See?  What's happening?  Oh, I think he's okay.  You can tell I'm intimidated of you.  Yes, Pat?  Look at that face.  Wait, were you taunting him  with that?  Does that make you feel good?  No, I'm making sure  we're all good.  No, that made it sound  like you were being sarcastic.  Like you could tell  I'm intimidated by you. 
[03:44:30]  Does that make you feel good?  Like big man.  That's not what I'm looking for.  What are you looking for, Pat?  I didn't...  You guys are less  than two feet apart.  I never expected  it to get to this point.  I'm not looking for anything.  Pull his heart out.  I would love to.  Wouldn't that be great?  What could he do...  Kale-maa.  Kale-maa.  Just like pull his heart out.  Indiana Jones,  Tumble of Doom.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hmm.  All right, they're not even  really looking at each other.  I can't.  I bet...  Everywhere but it's in. 
[03:45:00]  I bet you could  left hand slap him  in the face  before Poe could even...  No, no.  I could tell  because it was slow motion.  I just watched through the reaction.  You really could have  gone a lot faster.  I know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, Pat was just having fun.  Look, Master Poe was in there.  How about I am Master?  The Master.  How about this?  How about a handshake?  Yeah, a handshake needs to be done.  It's a game.  Are you faster than the Master?  That's right.  I think Sam's reaching out his hand. 
[03:45:30]  Will you do that for me, Pat?  Will you shake my hand in honor?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  I guess that was a no.  Oh, boy.  They're going for it.  That was some weird handshake.  That was a little something going on.  Yeah.  Wow.  Pat, why did you have to shake his hand like that?  Now I have a problem with you.  I'm sorry.  We set this whole thing up nice for you  and you grabbed his hand  and pulled him toward you  so you could, like, destroy him.  I'm sorry.  A nice handshake.  I'm sorry.  This whole thing for you.  We can't beat the guy.  We can't have you walking around 
[03:46:00]  wanting to...  We can have you hate each other  but we can't be worried  that stupid little Sam  is going to get physically beaten up.  Even though it would be fun to watch.  I've been walking around  wanting to kill him for a year, though.  I know, but you have to work that out  and let me tell you what happens.  If we ever hire you,  we can't be violent.  You kill Sam.  There's a position on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Ta-da.  Tony gets hired.  That's right.  Just remember when you're shaking his hand,  your new name in the office  is going to be newspaper face  for, like, three weeks.  Tony, you're flipping sides on me.  You don't understand what's going on.  Take one for the team, Sam. 
[03:46:30]  Tony, what was that about?  A nice handshake.  I need to see this.  Give him a nice shake.  A nice shake.  Smile.  Good.  Get him.  No, I won't get him.  Yeah, there it is.  Pusses.  Wow.  Now, Sam, tell him about the stink finger  you just gave him while shaking his hand.  There's no stink...  Poe, would you smell my hand?  There's no stink fingers here.  And E-Rock is just smiling like a retard  because it's not him. 
[03:47:00]  Yeah, Pat, don't you understand  all the abuse everyone else gets around here?  Yeah.  It gets really ugly.  No, I know.  And I fully understand that.  And I fully accept that.  Instead of saying shit,  we were saying Nagel.  I mean, that's pretty brutal.  Absolutely.  Oh, you had to bring that up?  That takes out a whole family,  not just Eric.  Oh, I think you meant a whole substance.  Until he had to go and wreck the whole thing.  Yeah.  That was fun.  No, it's all right.  Yeah.  It's all right.  No, it's not.  It's...  All right, Pat, 
[03:47:30]  you got to chill, man.  I'm calm.  I can't freak out.  I'm fine.  Do you talk to anyone about this?  No.  Because this is a real thing.  I've never seen this before.  I know.  I try not to get like this.  But what's scary is  if we didn't have this on the air today,  people go,  well, you provoked it.  But if that's been going on  behind the scenes  and we didn't know it,  that may have exploded  at a time when fucking Poe was at court  or not here  and no one was there to stop it.  That may have exploded  where a fucking fan  or Danny had to run in  and stop it. 
[03:48:00]  So it's like now we're all aware  of it because it's on the air.  That would be a pain in the ass.  That would be awful.  What a pain in the ass  that would be to break that up.  Have to pick Sam's dumb teeth  out of the fucking rug  and lose Duffy.  And that face is made for TV.  Well, you know,  then we'd have to answer  to his mother.  She'd be really upset.  No kidding.  She'd have to mash up fish sticks  and fucking  feed it to you like applesauce.  Yeah.  I'd be very happy, actually.  Sam, are you going to continue  fucking with Pat Duffy?  Or is this kind of like the...  Well, we can go ahead and...  Is this a turning point? 
[03:48:30]  We can go ahead  and put a breather on that  for the time being.  Let the hot temperatures  cool down a little bit  before we start doing  any of the jokes  around the office.  Wow.  I think Sam has learned  a little something today, too.  Just a little bit.  I feel like we've all  learned something about ourselves.  I think so, yes.  Yes.  You all right, Sam?  Oh, I'm good.  You're a brave motherfucker, man.  He is.  No, he's not.  We made him do it.  No, I'm not talking about...  And with Poe standing there.  No, I'm not talking about this. 
[03:49:00]  I'm talking about  how he just takes his shots.  Oh, that's because  he's a smart-ass  that never thinks  the consequences.  I'm not even kidding.  You are the biggest  smart-ass around here  and you just don't think  of the consequences  like some animal  like Duffy's  is just going to  pound your face in.  I will tell you,  to Duffy's credit,  my ribs may bruise  because of the shots  with the remote control.  The remote control.  He wailed it into you.  Yeah, he ruined it.  Wow, that had to hurt.  But even Duffy,  you got to give...  Even though you don't like Sam,  you got to give him credit  for one thing, 
[03:49:30]  is that even though  he's scared to death  of getting his teeth  knocked out,  he is...  Sam's a funny dude.  Oh, absolutely.  And he did actually...  Knowing that your rage  was there,  he did kind of go...  Because he's not challenging  you as a man  like, I'll kick you around.  He went for the fucking  funny angle  knowing that there was  physical harm  that could come to him.  That is the sign  of a fucking funny guy.  I got to say that for Sam.  Yeah, I won't take  anything away from Sam.  I think he's a really  funny dude,  but he just...  I don't know.  What a piece of shit.  Yeah, he's a fucking asshole.  I'll take them both.  Yeah.  But it's not even Sam. 
[03:50:00]  He reminds you of something.  That's why you got  to talk to someone.  Who taunted you?  Everybody.  When you were...  Why?  What was it about you  when you were a kid?  You sound like a normal guy.  I don't know.  You don't ask  to get fucked with.  It just happens.  Would they beat you up?  Yeah, I would be beat up  a bunch of times  when I was a kid.  Just made fun of  fucking constantly.  Who taunted you?  What would they make fun of you?  Who would they make fun of?  You're not a make-fun-able guy.  Well, that's the point.  He made himself look like  he's not the make-fun-able guy.  He used to be.  He's got the tats.  He's got the crazy man beard. 
[03:50:30]  You don't know.  Who's fucking with him now?  Crazy man beard.  Think of him  without the beard,  without the tats.  Do you work out or something?  No.  All right.  Landscape.  Landscape.  So you're getting exercise.  Imagine him a little doughier  without the facial hair.  I was a little over 300 pounds  at one point.  Oh, okay.  So you're a fat kid.  Yeah, I was a big fat kid.  Hey, get a load of fats over there.  Yeah, that's pretty much  what you got.  His name's Tony.  What are you doing?  I've been fat since eight.  I'm fine.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Tony, I've got to stick up for you.  I'm starting to like you a lot more. 
[03:51:00]  That's a coincidence.  You were fat since eight.  You were fat since eight.  You were fat since eight.  Of course.  Sometimes mine take  a couple of minutes.  You were 300 pounds.  Yeah.  Wow.  Really?  Yeah.  That was huge.  In shape pounds or?  No.  Real out of shape pounds.  Just bleh.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What name hurt the most  that they would call you?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Just mainly stupid.  I don't like being called stupid.  Did your father call you stupid?  A couple times, yes. 
[03:51:30]  Okay.  Now, this is an honest question.  I'm not kidding.  Were you stupid?  I don't think so.  Oh, okay.  Because there are some kids  that are just fucking stupid.  Yeah.  No, I don't think I'm stupid at all.  No.  I've seen you show us  your intelligence.  Yeah.  I think I'm somewhat intelligent.  You know who's stupid?  Sam is real fucking stupid.  What do you mean?  Because you're fucking...  You taunt a jackal.  Yeah.  You just fucking taunt animals  that can kill you.  Well, it's like being at the zoo  and just hoping those bars  on the cage don't break. 
[03:52:00]  You're the tiger fucking guy  with the slingshot  shooting the fucking tiger.  Dude, you gotta size up  the person you're being  a smartass to.  I was well aware  of the consequences  of my actions.  The quicker you learn  that lesson,  the better you're gonna be.  Trust me.  I was hoping I'd have  space to run.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I knew that Pat Duffy  had it in him  and I'm well aware  that if I get him angry enough,  he will physically annihilate me.  You got a bruise yet?  I don't know.  Ooh.  That's for you. 
[03:52:30]  That's for Pal Talk.  You got a bruise?  Do you have a bruise?  That's for Pal Talk.  I don't like Sam's hairy stomach.  It actually shows  that he's a man for real.  That takes the whole  twink thing out of it.  It really does.  Robert Kelly's gonna be  very disappointed.  We'd have to nair you.  He was hoping you'd have  a hairless body.  Just like nair all the hair  off you so you're a true twink.  Yeah, I'll shave it  to save the gimmick.  That's a gimmick.  See, there he goes again.  Oh, that's Sam.  Yeah.  Pat, you alright?  I'm okay. 
[03:53:00]  Alright, Pat's alright.  I'm just going over my head  the things that I would have  changed about this already.  Just things I could have  done better.  Things I thought of now  to say.  Like what?  Like what?  I don't know.  Give us an example.  You panic in those moments.  You gotta stop panning.  You worry about the results  or none of your business  as I was told.  All you can do is  spit out what you got  and wherever the fuck  it lands, it lands.  Don't worry about  how it's gonna look  or sound.  Just save it for the next guy  who misses something  in the trash can.  That whole attack  was Sam. 
[03:53:30]  I saw Sam in my head.  Wow.  The whole time.  He's got a problem with you.  Oh my god.  That's the first thing  I said to him  when he came in the office  after we all knew that  I was like,  you thought you just  pictured my head  on that construction  worker's body, didn't you?  And he, yes I did.  Picture your head anywhere  except on your shoulders.  Yeah.  Pretty much.  Fuck.  He sees an afro, it's over.  Therapy's going very well today.  Eat up Martha  has a great idea.  Have each staff member  come in and give Pat  one piece of  constructive criticism.  Oh, fuck. 
[03:54:00]  Who wants to line up  and give him  constructive criticism?  Than will do it.  Alright, Than?  Big, tall Than.  This is constructive now.  Not...  For real.  For real.  Well, there's a real  obvious one.  Do you mean it has to do  with radio production  or just like life?  Like,  Mind Your Temper?  Hold on,  words from Nana.  Nana! 
[03:54:30]  The Nana and Sam show.  Mind Your Temper.  That's right,  and then put on a sweater.  It's chilly in here.  Settle down,  I'm going to watch my stories.  Yeah.  Mind Your Temper.  Fucking...  Anybody else wants to  get in on the  constructive criticism?  I see Danny at the door.  Danny's making his way in.  I was just watching the show.  Oh, okay.  Anybody else brave enough  to do the constructive criticism?  I'll give him some  constructive criticism.  I know that  Pat gets bogged down a lot  doing some other work, 
[03:55:00]  and I think that might  take away from  the time that he could  be trying to be creative,  which Tony has  a big problem with.  So maybe he should try  and take a few minutes  or maybe an hour  or just some piece of time.  Maybe not even here.  Maybe at home or something  and try to come up  with something creative  if he wants to  not be known as  Stunt Boy all the time.  I like that he's  known as Stunt Boy.  Well, and I don't mind either  because I think  it's great radio,  but it's a problem for...  See, 100 Stunt Boy  is like, ugh,  but Pat Duffy's  stunts are impressive.  To me, that's not even  a bad thing to be  a Stunt Boy. 
[03:55:30]  I think Stunt Boy  is a derogatory term.  You do shit that  most people won't  fucking do.  Which is amazing.  And I enjoy it.  You know,  there's a cringe style  to your fucking performance,  which is necessary.  He brushes his teeth  with dog shit,  but if he doesn't  want to be known  as the kid  that brushed his teeth  with dog shit,  you know,  try and come up  with another angle.  I'm not saying  that you have to  stop doing the stunts.  Keep doing them.  They're great,  but at the same time,  if it's going to bother you  to be known as the kid  that eats dog shit...  I never said that,  though.  It doesn't bother me.  Just the whole thing 
[03:56:00]  with Tony saying  that's all that I do.  That was my whole argument.  Because, yeah,  obviously on air,  one of the only things  I do is stunts  and stuff on the air,  but behind the scenes  I do a bunch of stuff.  Yes.  All right, very good.  I guess that's it.  Can we take four breaks  in a row?  Which torture device  did you like?  The one that I listed  at the bottom.  The last one.  The saw?  The saw.  Why don't you get a device  to clean all these papers  that bounced off your face?  What are you doing?  Thanks, Tony.  Thanks.  Wow. 
[03:56:30]  The saw may represent  human ingenuity's  darkest hour.  The idea here is that  when the victim  is suspended upside down,  most of the blood  will go to the head.  But that is an important  part of the process,  you see,  because as the torturers  saw into the victim's crotch,  all of the blood  in the head  will oxygenate the brain  so that the victim  will not pass out  as one normally would  under such excruciating pain.  Typically,  the saw would reach 
[03:57:00]  the victim's navel  before unconsciousness  would take hold,  sometimes as far  as the midriff.  Imagine that.  Your legs are spread.  You're upside down.  They take a saw,  put it right against  your fucking taint  and just start  sawing you in half.  Holy shit.  Okay, yeah.  And you're conscious  through enough of it.  Yeah, because if you're  like hanging  like from your arms,  let's say,  and they start doing that,  the blood rushes out,  you're going to pass out  so the pain is going  to be a little bit  less.  So you get all the blood  in your head  and you're just feeling 
[03:57:30]  a saw.  Fuck, dude.  Sawing through your taint.  Wow, wow, wow.  Is there another one  you like?  Wow, wow, wow.  Wow, wow.  Not very nice.  Maybe a try  it out on Gypsy Woman.  Hey, we ever get  that boar clip  we forgot today?  All right, thank you.  Great success.  And botched executions.  You like one of these, Pat?  I like all of them, actually.  The first one  is pretty good.  Alan Lee Davis,  that's the one  that you started reading, Tony.  Before he was pronounced  that, the blood from his mouth 
[03:58:00]  had poured onto the collar  of his white shirt  and the blood on his chest  had spread to about  the size of a dinner plate,  even oozing through  the buckle holes  on the leather chest strap  holding him to the chair.  All right.  The Hawaiian alphabet  only has 12 letters.  It's an apple cap pit.  God damn.  Oh, you're a prick.  All right, line of the day  is brought to you by FTD.com.  What's wrong, Danny? 
[03:58:30]  Do you think we could  take a quick break  and come back  with line of the day?  Okay, we could do that.  We'll be right back.  I got a trickle, Dan.  Can you just do it later?  What was that?  An exhibition?  We need emotional content.  Try again.  I said emotional content.  Not anger.  Now try again.  That's it.  The opium and anthony virus. 
[03:59:00]  Get infected.  Cynthia wants to say  something to her husband.  Cynthia in California.  What's up, Cynthia?  Yeah.  Cynthia, California.  You're on.  Cynthia.  Cynthia?  California?  From the golden state.  California.  California A. 
[03:59:30]  I'm sorry.  There she is.  Hi, Cynthia.  How are you?  Hi.  I'm sorry to bother you guys,  but I had a question.  My husband is a huge fan of yours,  and I honestly hate your show.  Oh, thank you.  It's a big sacrifice for me to call you guys.  Wait, wait.  Why do you?  Hold on, Cynthia.  Why do you hate our show?  I just don't like your humor.  Because it's a little raw,  a little, uh...  What?  Which type of humor don't you like?  The sexual, the racial, the... 
[04:00:00]  What is it?  Yeah.  Uh, I guess just the raunchiness of it.  Raunchiness?  In one way.  You gotta be a little more specific.  Yeah, because even raunchy could be funny, right?  I guess it's just a little over the line.  A little over the line.  Like what?  What really got to you?  Because maybe...  He listens to it every day.  Every day.  Your husband's a big fan.  I understand that.  And you have a problem with it.  And this phone call is going somewhere, obviously.  But you gotta give us an example,  because maybe we can learn from this.  Because we do want, like, more women to listen to our show. 
[04:00:30]  We want to, like, broaden our appeal.  Certainly.  Well, I don't know.  Like, what got you?  Like, name something you heard where you're like,  oh my god, why do you listen to these idiots?  Almost everything.  Almost everything.  I'm sorry.  Alright, well, why are you calling today?  Well, I really didn't want to be on air for this.  I just was wondering if there was a number I could call for, like...  My husband just got deployed. 
[04:01:00]  So I just was wondering if you guys could do anything cool for him.  Like, send something, or...  Uh, no.  Hmm.  Hmm.  She didn't like the show.  But she was looking for us to do something.  A favor, I guess.  Hmm.  Not a good strategy.  No.  No, of course.  Cynthia, call back.  Uh, happy birthday, Heather. 
[04:01:30]  It's Heather's birthday from Pal Talk.  Which Heather?  Heather.  I don't see these Pal...  Oh, who?  Which bitch is that?  Who?  Heather.  Happy birthday, Heather.  Oh!  Hi, Heather.  Hey, Heather.  It's her birthday.  I know I like to give her for her birthday.  Ha ha!  What there, Jimmy?  Nothing.  A laugh?  Yeah.  Just...  Ha ha!  Captain!  Um...  Ice diamonds!  I want Cynthia to call back. 
[04:02:00]  Because we, you know...  We're just funning around.  We fully support the troops and all that.  But he's not going to hear it, so what?  We're supposed to send him something, maybe?  We're just supposed to send him stuff.  Yeah.  All right, she'll call back.  She's listening right now.  No, she hates us.  Oh, look, she called back.  All right, put her on hold, and we'll...  You got her on hold?  All right, good.  We'll send out an O&A prize package to her husband.  That consists of.  Cool.  Who was just deployed.  Line of the Day is brought to you by FTD.com.  Mother's Day is this Sunday.  Get your mom a dozen pastel roses for just $29.99. 
[04:02:30]  And FTD will include a free gloss vase and a box of Godiva chocolates as well.  That's FTD.com.  Mm-hmm.  Ha ha ha!  Promo code XM.  It's fantastic.  Why does she hate us?  Who cares?  Yeah, but I was watching this movie last night, Hecklers. 
[04:03:00]  Mm-hmm.  And they got into the whole heckle thing and, like, how comedians get heckled and why it  bothers comedians even though one guy's heckling and the rest of the room is completely enjoying  the comedian.  And then they got into critics and what kind of scumbags they are.  And then they went into, like, you know, fan sites and websites and blogs.  Someone finally made a little film about that, huh?  Very interesting.  Jamie Kennedy.  Jamie Kennedy is going to be in tomorrow to discuss this movie, Heckler. 
[04:03:30]  Is it Thursday?  Yeah.  Okay.  Very interesting.  Jimmy's got a copy.  You should see it.  Yeah, I'm going to watch it today.  I was watching my Amish film.  You're Amish?  It was a documentary on the Amish.  Were you crying?  Then they have to raise their barns.  No, but they get to be sluts, though.  Yes.  And the Amish get to be sluts.  The Amish get to be sluts.  Well, they have that certain time.  It's called the...  The Amak time, it's called. 
[04:04:00]  No, Rama.  It's when the Vulcan goes back to the planet Vulcan and has to battle or take a bride.  Oh.  And his blood boils.  Sometimes they've got to fight their best friend.  That's a movie.  He'll shoot his best friend up with some drug that makes it look like he's dead, and then  he doesn't.  No?  No, this is different.  That was Amak time.  Now, this is where the Amish will leave the horse and buggy, and they go out in his society.  Yeah.  A lot of them come to New York City, the Amish. 
[04:04:30]  They experience the word of the English, which is our world, and they leave all the Amish stuff  back and where they're from, and if they liked it, they go back to the Amish church,  and if not, they stay out.  And become worse.  Whoever goes back.  90%.  Why?  Because I guess when they were raised at home.  I don't care.  Shut up.  All right.  It's true.  I guess when you're fucking a girl, you like to have a bonnet on her.  That's right.  Take it in the bonnet, you dirty girl.  You look like, oh, every husband looks like Pat Duffy. 
[04:05:00]  Oh.  They all have no mustache.  Fuck the girl right in her bonnet.  That's right.  Make, go out there and make me some butter.  90% go back?  90%.  Because I saw a documentary.  I don't know if it's the same one, but they show them doing this, and they're partying  their asses off doing drugs and drinking and smoking pot and having unprotected sex.  Fucking, socking, socking.  Eating, drinking, raising barns.  Pink socking. 
[04:05:30]  Oh, yeah.  And then 90% of these people, after getting a taste of that, decide they don't want this?  I guess they go back to say they want to go back and join church.  That is so messed up, man.  Me?  I'd be one of the 10%.  You can bet your bonnet on that.  I'm right there with you.  High five.  Jimbo.  Yeah, Jimbo.  But they say that a large percentage of the Amish don't stay out in the world of the  English.  Why not? 
[04:06:00]  I mean, I guess they just use that shit.  I don't get it.  And the word is rumspinger.  Yeah, rumspinger.  Rumspinger.  But I respect the Amish, though, because they want their teenagers to go out and then make  a decision.  Once they've seen the other world, so they won't get tempted later.  I like that.  You're not forcing it down your throat.  I'm with you, but something's going on that they're not explaining.  I bet you they make you cut your dick off and keep it there.  Until you come...  Something...  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  Boo!  It'll be okay.  I'm tired. 
[04:06:30]  But rumspinger.  Let's have a quick little discussion about this.  Is it called rumspinger?  Rumspinger?  I think so.  Something like that.  Something like that.  Spinger.  Spinger.  Rumspinger.  Rumspinger.  But something's not being explained.  Dumb fucking word.  Because all these people do this.  And 90% come back.  Something's not being explained.  I'm telling you.  Maybe they put the fear of God in them.  Like, you could have that life, but you're not going to...  Yes, it is.  They think they're not going to go to heaven.  But why?  If all of a sudden you're fucking and sucking and doing drugs and drinking, all of a sudden  you're not going to like that? 
[04:07:00]  They think they're not going to go to heaven.  And that has been ingrained in them for 16 years.  That's what I'm saying.  Something is going on there.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Ooh.  But they enjoy it.  I'm spinger.  But they all think that they're not going to go to heaven, so they come back.  I think they get it out of their system.  Yeah.  It's like they go, they go do it, and it's fun for a few years.  Some stay out, but a lot of them decide to come back.  I don't think it's for a few years.  It can be, sure.  A few months or a few years to get 21, whatever.  I think it's like the whole prom season, basically.  Oh, no.  Oh, it can be a few months or a few years.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Some of them are out to the 1920s. 
[04:07:30]  I better update my Amish knowledge.  Yeah, you seem to be confusing the Amish with another group of people.  I used to have some fine Amish knowledge.  I got to update my Amish knowledge.  You know what I know about the Amish?  When I'm in Lancaster trying to go do a gig.  Yeah.  Honk.  Get out of the way, fuck.  It's fucking 2008, stupid.  Honk.  Get a fucking piece of electricity, fuck.  A piece.  Honk.  Vote, fuck.  You won.  Vote, fuck, would be the name of a great punk band. 
[04:08:00]  Honk.  It's a medical insurance.  Shit for brains.  I seem to recognize your face.  Haunted.  Get familiar.  Honk.  Flick a light switch.  Fuck nut.  Love it.  What song can you sing right now?  On the spot.  It gives one.  None.  It gives one.  Please.  To do run, run, run, to do run, run. 
[04:08:30]  That's all I know.  Yeah.  Actually, I was a singer in a band in high school.  You were.  Yeah.  What was the name of the band?  What?  Foundry.  What are we doing?  You are tired.  We're running, I would love to see we run out of gas.  We never had a, we're never in a car.  How red is Clinton's face?  Jesus Christ.  That might be the TV.  It couldn't be.  He looks like one of the stripes.  He really does.  Red, white, and bill.  I was watching Clinton clips before today's show, and he said the dumbest thing about his wife and that Bosnia thing. 
[04:09:00]  What, she has great calves?  He said something to the effect that you've got to give her a break because when you're 60 years old and you're not sleeping, you're going to forget some things.  You're going to forget some things.  You weren't in a war?  Yeah, but why would you say that?  Because, you know, people are making their decision.  Oh, yeah.  They don't want to hear that because I don't think you get a lot of sleep when you're the president of the United States of America. 
[04:09:30]  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  Thank you, FTD.com.  One of my big fears are, one, well, we all know what my number one fear is.  Right, part of the bumblebee.  They tend to swarm, too.  Let's say hi to Jamie in Cleveland.  Jamie?  Hey, fellas.  What's going on?  Hey, you know a bit about the Amish?  Yeah.  I just wanted to say that if they decide to stay with the English, they can have no contact. 
[04:10:00]  They can't go back and visit their family, so I think that's probably why 90% of them go back.  Oh, I'm not allowed.  They also, but they get excommunicated if they join the church and then leave.  But I think their family will keep in contact with them and try to get them to come back.  Like, they keep calling them and talking to them, saying, we'd love you to come back.  That's not fair.  You give them a taste of this amazing shit, and then you go, look, you could continue that,  but you're not allowed to ever come back and have contact with your family.  I don't know about that.  I don't know if he's right or wrong. 
[04:10:30]  I bet you he's 100% right as far as the old days go, but I bet you they're trying to update their shit a little bit.  I don't think so.  It's like the Italians have the same type of thing.  It's called sex with a black person.  You can try it, but don't come back to the family.  And it kind of sounds like, what's the almost called everything?  Huh?  Rumpsbigger.  Rumpsbigger.  Oh, boy.  Sounds similar.  Yeah, there's a little different.  Fucks?  What? 
[04:11:00]  FTD.com.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Genocide on these.  Look at the print of them.  All right, Donnie, what's up?  Ooh, a knish.  Just eating a wasp's nest, dummy.  You old fool.  Oh, look, my hat is hanging from there.  Well, yeah, that was the joke, by the way.  What?  What's it called?  The Amish?  Rumpsbigger.  The Amish. 
[04:11:30]  And I guess the Italian is Humps.  Humps.  Yeah.  Just don't bother coming home.  Here is another runner-up line of the day.  No, there's a new couple moving in next door to me.  And that would just scare the crowd.  And they'd be like, oh, where's the for sale sign?  Well, you know what?  You save money, though, because they'll build their fence first.  They certainly would. 
[04:12:00]  Why are the phones ringing?  We gotta go home.  Or do we?  Yes.  Yeah.  Maybe today's surprise show.  Today could be the day.  What is it?  21 already?  I gotta pick up a chandelier.  Keith, do I have to pick up a chandelier today?  Thank you.  FDD.  What?  Just give him a message.  I have a big, nice chandelier.  Pick up.  Anthony was communicating with everybody but the show for the last hour and a half.  Fucking busy. 
[04:12:30]  I got painters, spacklers.  Do I get to pick up a chandelier?  Yeah, and a chandelier is being delivered.  He's wheeling and dealing while all hell's breaking loose in the studio.  Chandelier.  Yeah, I had it all on Pal Talk.  I was working cameras.  Jim, how does the Yamish call their kids asking them to come home if they don't have those phones?  They do have phones.  I guess some of them do.  I guess they might have them for emergencies or whatever. 
[04:13:00]  Or fire.  Is that what you learned from your Yamish documentary?  Well, yeah, I mean, there was phone calls being made and they speak in this dumb Pennsylvania Dutch lingo.  How does it go?  I wish I knew.  How does it go?  I don't know.  Give us an example.  I can't.  I can't remember any of it.  Why?  You knew they were so.  I honestly don't.  I couldn't understand.  I was reading the subtitles, believe it or not.  Line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day. 
[04:13:30]  Line of the day.  Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom.  I mean, we're doing something nice.  It's just a fun story.  It's the same conversation.  I know.  Yeah.  And how Obama can't win because the white man is doomed and you want to shoot people.  And I want to hook her and you can't stop picking your dumb hand.  He's fat and retarded.  Steve's incompetent.  Dan's a drunk.  And Dan hates his mother.  We get it.  Um, no.  Anyway, what are you doing? 
[04:14:00]  Yeah, of course.  New show opener.  I'm thinking right there, huh?  Hmm.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Uh, Stephen S. from Bayshore wants to know, chandelier is Ant and Keith's code for sex  harness.  No, it's not a sex swing or harness.  Chandelier for my entryway.  I failed, uh, most of the listeners today because I didn't give you the, uh, weather for Haiti 
[04:14:30]  today.  I'm really, really sorry.  Oh, ha, ha, ha.  I'm really, really sorry about that.  I'm really, really, really sorry.  It's going to be sunny with a chance of, well, it's as easy as I was going to throw it.  Of course.  We get it.  Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee.  Oh, wide left.  All right.  Mmm.  Time to mosey.  Yeah, time to mosey.  Um. 
[04:15:00]  Oh.  Time to mosey, right, Jim?  Oh.  Relaxation.  Comfort.  Bliss.  Come fly the heavenly skies with ONA Airlines.  Here at ONA Air, we treat our customers with the respect and patience that they deserve.  Sit down, sir.  Sit down.  We're on an active taxiway.  Sit down, sir.  Our top-notch whores and topless flight attendants will serve top-shelf booze if they're not 
[04:15:30]  busy working the gears in the cockpit.  Winky-eye.  Our professionally trained pilots will keep your mind at ease, never having to fathom the  thought that you'll plummet to a horrifying demise in this aluminum death trap.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It's my co-pilot, Jim.  Uh, one moment, please.  Our chefs have prepared excellent meals to make you feel right at home.  Sorry, no vegetarian plates are not fairies. 
[04:16:00]  Really?  Never worry again as our dedicated culturally-biased security staff allows no children, retards, or  women over the age of 40 onto the flight.  Ah!  Hey, don't forget, terror alert's in the red, so pack your gats, because we're sure as  hell gonna ONA air.  We care.  You scream until you can't scream anymore, and then you die.  Mm-hmm. 
[04:16:30]  Jim?  Ah, Jim.  Jim.  Jim.  What's wrong?  Depressed.  Why are you depressed?  Why are you depressed?  Oh, I just am.  But I gotta make a phone call to my lawyer.  Sex stuff, right?  I got you a little down.  Just crank out a patch.  Steve, you do-  You're gonna fly like crazy, right? 
[04:17:00]  Why?  Hollywood.  Oh, I came yesterday.  Oh, you did?  I'm a weak man, yes.  Oh, really?  Yeah, you need something.  Let's do our meeting live on the air.  You're not getting your fucking-  Meeting time, let's go.  Your cum chip?  You haven't gotten your 30-day cum chip.  Meeting on the air, let's go.  On the air.  Jody!  Meeting on the air time.  What?  Come on, Jody.  Meeting on the air.  I thought we were on the air.  Where's Mike?  Look how cute Jody is.  Behind the scenes people coming in.  Uh-oh.  Sorry, Jim. 
[04:17:30]  Blowing pens at you.  Hi.  All right, let's go.  What's up with the computer?  Make a point.  Are they going to let us break it?  Do you want me to sing?  Oh, he's going to-  This is what I fucking deal with it on a daily basis.  What are they saying, man?  Who is this?  By the way, the show is officially over.  Who wrote it?  Allowing you to listen in to a show meeting.  Something a little different today.  I'm going to check it out.  Yeah.  Answer Terry Carver.  Jimmy's making phone calls to lawyers.  Terry Car-  Terry Car?  What happened?  Is the one that, like, says- 
[04:18:00]  Yeah.  What happened, Ant?  Uh, I-  Thank you.  I'm not pressuring-  I'm not being pressured into a situation.  These orders come from the-  The criticality of the need.  Deal with the laptop for a while.  Your machine will be there when I can get a tech to finish.  You know, the fucking Opie and Anthony show is-  Is, uh, pretty much-  We were told by-  You know Eric Logan, the guy?  One of the bosses around there?  One of the, uh, top, uh, programs on the whole fucking XM platform. 
[04:18:30]  So if dopey cocksucker douchebag Anthony needs a computer for the show,  Terrence fucking Car should get me one.  Alright?  Asshole?  You get it?  Not fucking deal with it.  Uh, it'll get there when I can get a tech to finish.  What are the techs working on?  What's more important?  Merger.  What is?  Fuck the merger.  The show is going on.  I need it, Terrence.  Email me, motherfucker.  Not Steve.  Tell me why you can't get off your fucking ass 
[04:19:00]  and get me a fucking computer that works, cocksucker.  Logan, I need to talk to you about this douchebag.  Thank you.  End the fucking meeting on that.  Cunt.  Douche.  I hate fucking corporate cunts.  I hate them.  Go fuck yourself.  See, this is why we're having the meeting live in the air.  Because this is...  Oh, God.  This is what Anthony does to all of us as soon as the mics are off.  We all live in fear.  There's no need for that to be an XM machine, by the way. 
[04:19:30]  Right.  That's all I'm saying.  Here's the problem.  I'll let the listeners in on a little thing.  We're not on the air.  XM is whatever.  Just put the mic back here.  XM is petrified about people having access to their computers.  Because I guess, technically, you could download their entire fucking music library  and store it on your iPod and show your friends.  I don't know what the fuck their big paranoia is.  But let me just get this out.  Here's the fucking issue.  I don't care if it's an XM computer. 
[04:20:00]  Hook it up to any Ethernet line that's coming into the fucking building.  I'll steal it from one of the offices down the hall, from Steinway.  Run a cable up.  Get me a splitter.  I'll do it myself.  Just get me a fucking computer that works.  That's all I'm asking for.  I don't need it to have the let.  I don't need it to have your bullshit fucking XM programs on there.  I want a fucking computer that can get PalTalk and Internet Explorer.  Period.  That's all I fucking need.  Are you having a moment? 
[04:20:30]  No.  I'm trying to make a fucking point and not do stupid, useless emails.  He didn't seem to take you very seriously, though, by dealing with it.  What is that?  Fucking Norton is just a tick.  You're a tick.  I think he's being more than reasonable.  More than reasonable.  Every fucking email is reasonable.  This is complete bullshit.  I am not going to fucking deal with this anymore.  What does that word mean?  That was too big for me.  Sam, what does that mean?  I can't take it anymore, and I'm not going to sit there and be shoved off and deal with 
[04:21:00]  a laptop.  Tell those dudes down there to set Hinkley straight on the dumb Arbitron satellite rings that don't  make any sense.  I don't give a shit about that.  Oh, you got an email on that?  And tag team.  Let's tag off to Opie.  That was a snotty tone, though, that he sent out.  That was snotty.  Deal with it.  Deal with it.  It's a criticality.  Criticality, it's the fucking show, you dummy.  It's fucking the Opie and Anthony show. 
[04:21:30]  It's not fucking that stupid ass whatever the fuck.  Ted's fuckatorium.  Right.  Why the fuck do they even fucking pay this guy, Nathaniel Brown?  What?  What?  What?  It's awfully close to my name.  No.  I'm going to just cut Brown out of the replay.  Who's AT?  And Taylor?  And Nathaniel, do you guys think it would be prudent to offer some information to David 
[04:22:00]  Hinkley at the New York Daily News, whose article on the Arbitron satellite ratings made  us look fairly irrelevant?  Some information that might be a little more realistic.  And then you gave him the article so he could see for himself.  Opie brought it up on the air this morning, so I want to make sure I touch base with you  all.  You know what's weird?  Steve actually does do a little work around here.  Yeah, but strange.  I don't like the way you started it off.  Do you think it would be prudent?  But you should start off a little forcefully.  I think what we need to do is...  This is their fucking response.  My advice is to leave it alone.  Why?  No need to give him a reason to re-report Arbitron's figures for ONA. 
[04:22:30]  Also, David is well aware of why we say Arbitron's numbers under-report satellite radio listenership,  especially ONA, since they're on both SAT and Terrestrial.  Last year, he ran a lengthy quote from me on the subject.  How about now?  But it's brand new, two days old.  Yeah, why not now?  We're in the New York paper, and it looks like we suck dick on satellite radio.  No.  Why would they want to leave this alone?  Why do you want to keep pushing the...  Yeah, that's not the way you handle PR.  All right, let it go. 
[04:23:00]  What's that?  Meeting time.  Oh.  This was the meeting, isn't it?  I thought that was it.  Meeting adjourned.  Are we done?  What do we got?  Uh, that author.  What author?  From Mike.  Remember?  Who?  Who?  Author about the terrorism.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Mike, uh, one of our boys once, uh...  Mike Hunt?  No, his old boss wrote a book on terrorism.  All right.  Yeah, we'll book him.  Is he Islamic?  Huh?  What?  Is that?  Um...  Yeah? 
[04:23:30]  All right, yeah.  Jimmy's nodded, yeah.  Anyway.  Everyone knows Jimmy runs the show behind the scenes.  The people from CBS are wondering, why are they talking to microphones?  What are they doing here?  What are they doing in this room?  They're just amazed.  All right, what else?  Uh, tomorrow's Jamie Kennedy.  Ooh.  Yeah, we promoted that.  That movie, Heckler, is going to be good.  Johnny's third play.  Actually, the Heckler's not going to be good for everybody.  I found it really interesting, but...  Most people might, too.  They want to know what goes on.  A lot of people wonder what happens when somebody heckles what's the performer thinking.  I've gotten that question quite a bit. 
[04:24:00]  Jamie, uh, Kennedy, like, he confronted, like, people that were at his comedy shows  and asked them what, you know, why they didn't like him, and then he confronts critics  that gave him bad reviews.  He had balls.  Okay.  Um, Sandy Kane's coming in tomorrow for something.  We can use her with, uh, uh...  We hit her with a shovel or something?  Well, she's, uh, Johnny Fairplay's bringing girls with him.  Oh, good.  It'd be hot.  Cool.  So she's, she's usually good in those, uh, situations.  She sure is.  Yeah.  Does she get her in earlier than 10.30?  Oh, yeah.  She's coming at nine. 
[04:24:30]  Don't scream at me.  I'm not screaming, sweetie.  All right.  Can we enter?  Don't scream at me.  Can we reenact the, the Philly, uh, beating with Sandy Kane?  Yes.  All right, good.  Um, got Crash from Toucher and Rich.  Okay.  He's going to talk to us about, uh, uh, Burger King something.  Some chick he used to bang for Burger King.  Burger King Cheryl.  What?  Is the story.  What, Danny?  What is he talking about?  Burger King Cheryl.  There was a story that was called in that he wanted to know more about.  So he's going to talk to us about that.  That's why.  That's why. 
[04:25:00]  Boy, he deflected by pointing to Opie, didn't he?  It's something Opie wanted to know about.  Shut up, little man.  Exactly.  You know, you see strange things.  Like, you want to know where they're coming from.  No, we talked about it on the air yesterday.  No, those guys were talking about all the, the weird chicks they used to bang and stuff  and drag, like, to their apartment when fucking, uh, Jimmy and, and Voss were going at it yesterday.  And then this story came up where this guy had this go-to chick that was called Burger King what?  Burger King Cheryl. 
[04:25:30]  Cheryl.  And she was just a fucking lunatic.  I got a copy.  Derek, you got a copy?  No.  Oh, good.  Thank God.  We'll hook up with Imus tomorrow.  Oh, yeah.  To help him with his radio phone.  Interesting.  All right.  Jesus Christ.  Leave me alone.  We're not supposed to be on the air.  You're not supposed to be listening to this.  Go away.  Leave.  So I say interesting.  Interesting.  Um, do you want to talk about this stuff?  Yeah, it's fine.  Jody? 
[04:26:00]  Anthony.  Yep.  Vulcan Motor Club.  What about them?  They lease or rent those cars.  You can take anything you want.  There's a list of cars they're wondering if you're interested in taking for like 10 days.  10 days?  Why?  And then you do live leads around them.  I wonder how my fucking...  Hey, this is an Aston Martin.  Porsche.  Really?  Yeah, Porsche.  I like the, um...  Lamborghini.  Ford GT.  And I like the Ferrari 430.  Please take a photo of the one with a big bottle of booze in your hand.  Oh, well.  Where are these, uh, people out of?  Because I have a car club that might be angry that I'm doing this for. 
[04:26:30]  Uh-oh.  Yeah, this is...  But no, I, you know, I pay them, so...  Yeah.  Fuck them.  I will.  I didn't sign an exclusivity contract with anybody.  Fucking car club.  Are you the only guy they're giving cars to?  Why should they be the only club you're getting cars from?  Yeah, Jimmy.  Fuck, I'm right in the gas tank.  Yeah.  Have Anthony pick the exotic car of his choice, blow, drive for 10 days at his disposal.  I could dispose of it when I'm...  Anybody you want.  Just leave it on the side of the road.  Okay, I'm done. 
[04:27:00]  I'll beat up and get into something else.  Are we talking about your dating life?  No.  I'll read that line again, because I got confused.  I thought you were talking about your dating life.  Have Anthony pick the exotic car of his choice, blow, drive it for 10 days at his disposal.  I'm sorry, I got confused.  Obi, you're on here too, but, I mean, if you want to have maybe Kenny?  Um, I'll take the...  Oh, let me see what I can take.  Ferrari 430.  Okay.  I don't blame you.  People want to know who Jody is, she's really hot. 
[04:27:30]  Take the GT, Obi.  Well, thank you.  She has very nice eyes.  Drive it in the rain.  Very nice eyes.  Very nice smile.  What do you want me to do?  Take the GT and take it skiing.  I think it's both in a motor club.  Do you guys got, like, um, like a Toyota Corolla on this?  Yeah, that was nice.  Smart car.  Kia.  All right, what else?  I'll take the, uh, ooh, the Bentley.  Yeah, let's put your...  Take it and drive it to work and just park it out front and dare them to tell it.  Wait, what car has, like, a driver? 
[04:28:00]  Like, a Bentley or something?  Oh, you want that kind of thing?  Don't you want to drive fast like a retard?  No, I want to get Kenny in one of those dumb driving hats and drive me around for you.  Oh, my God.  Okay, that's funny.  For 10 days, he's got to be your fucking Bitterman.  Yes, Bitterman.  And that's what I was looking at.  Oh, that's great.  I'm scared to drive this thing, G.H.  I might hit something.  Stupid head hitting the ceiling.  And he has to get out and open the door.  Yeah.  Here you go, G.H.  The rest, I'm going to...  I'll go quickly.  Do you have any issues if some of the members of the show want to do, like, a party VIP style 
[04:28:30]  with some listeners at the New York Dolls slash Flesh Dancers?  We don't like girls.  I know.  What, the staff?  What?  Yeah, like, if I did, like, a party, we'd give away tickets and VIP style.  Oh, and force the staff to stay out late?  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, that's fine.  Yeah, I think so.  We have...  Fuck them.  ...shows the sex appeal of a fucking cancer ward.  We have no chicks on at all.  Yeah.  Are you guys in the loop on Las Vegas at all?  This big...  Yeah, we're going to Vegas in September.  I think it's September.  September?  Yeah.  That's nice.  Okay, so I'll just keep you in the loop as I learn more about it, so we're all on the  same page.  All right, don't look me in the eyes.  I'm getting embarrassed. 
[04:29:00]  What?  What's going on in Vegas?  The NBC premiere.  We're going to...  September, a big NBC thing.  I'll know more on Monday.  Am I allowed to go?  No.  Jimmy can go.  He's part of the show if we're doing interviews.  Jimmy's got to fucking go.  Oh, okay.  No, no.  Right?  He's excluded?  It's a fucking joke.  We don't go without you.  Maybe you don't go.  Maybe you don't go now.  I'm going.  What's it for?  I've just invited myself.  NBC's new shows.  They're going to do like...  All the morning shows are going out.  So we interview...  Oh, my God.  We're going to get in fights again.  The people...  Yeah.  It's like one of those radio things where there's a bunch of radio people there. 
[04:29:30]  We can totally tool on them.  All right.  What else?  Am I allowed to go?  Yes.  Jimmy has to go or we don't go.  I'm busy.  Jimmy doesn't think...  You can't be busy.  Okay.  Fuck Jimmy.  Jimmy, are you here on the 21st and 22nd?  Mind your business!  It is my business.  Are you here on the 21st and 22nd?  The 24st and 22nd?  21st and 22nd.  21st and 22nd.  Yes, I'm here.  Are you really?  Okay, good.  What is that thing, though?  Because I do want to put that in my calendar if I'm going.  9th and 10th of September.  Fighters for UFC.  Tito Ortiz.  Does he interest you if I can get him in?  We already got him in. 
[04:30:00]  Tito.  Yeah, we got him.  Hey!  Only over here, though.  Roll, did you book that?  All right.  Anybody else for UFC you'd be interested in?  They're doing a fight at the MGM.  Who are the options?  Oh, for that thing?  Yeah.  Well, you asked for Kimbo Slice.  We're going after him.  You know any of these guys?  EJ Ken, Sean Sir, Tito.  I know that's not UFC, but I just didn't want him to say it.  Machida.  Silva.  I don't know any of these guys.  Silva's a big name, but I don't know much about him.  He's Brazilian.  He speaks Portuguese, I think.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, I would say, why don't we see how the Tito interview goes this week? 
[04:30:30]  We're doing him next week.  We're in June.  June 11th?  June 6th.  June 6th.  Let's have Pat Duffy fight him.  Have him throw papers at Pat.  Why don't we take...  Can we get Latino on that?  Yeah, that's fine.  I'll email you the name so you have it.  Penny a gallon.  We're doing this.  We want to do this.  You guys are totally into it.  Let's jump on a gas promotion.  I don't want to put legs into it if it's not going to go.  If it's like more than what gas it's supposed to be.  Yeah, it'd be funny.  I liked the more as a goof.  To have like this huge... 
[04:31:00]  The thing is, you'd need like massive visibility and promotion for the more than.  It would have to be at a gas station that would be into doing it and just make it a big thing.  Yeah.  That is so ridiculous.  Like, why the fuck are they doing this?  Ten dollars a gallon, Tuesday only.  Yeah, yeah.  And then you show up with like, you know, radio station, promotion shit, t-shirt.  And no one comes.  And no one comes.  It's ridiculous.  Ten dollars a gallon.  Either that or it's like, fill up your tank for ten dollars, but you don't specify what kind of a tank it is. 
[04:31:30]  Wait a minute.  And there's some fine print that needs to be read.  It's diesel gas.  Do you guys want to rethink this?  And then talk about the song.  Yeah, we'll revisit that.  Okay.  Yeah.  We'll let it out.  I mean, there are a couple of really good ideas there that we should look into.  Okay.  I like that, though.  Yeah.  I love the idea of live reports from the field.  Yeah.  And there's a fucking van with two guys and no one.  And just no one would show up. 
[04:32:00]  It's like, they looked ten dollars.  You couldn't turn your wheel away from the place fast enough.  How stupid is that?  Make it twelve and see if it ever comes.  Twelve bucks.  I just had Victor Carolli come tomorrow.  He's available tomorrow to do a voice session.  And then we don't have him for three weeks.  Who's he?  He's the voice guy for the radio station.  If we want to do some stuff for the five and nine hours.  Who are you?  My name's Mike.  And I'm new here.  Oh, this is Stunt Brain.  Hey, Stunt Brain.  How you doing?  What is this about?  This is, you know, that five o'clock and nine o'clock, the replay stuff. 
[04:32:30]  Oh, yeah.  So we're just looking at...  Well, people aren't supposed to know about that yet.  That's all right.  Oh, we got...  All right.  So for the five o'clock hour, ONA's pregame, ONA's foreplay, ONA's non-drug-induced flashback,  ONA's leftovers, or ONA's contractual obligations.  That's funny.  Pre-game?  Contractual obligations.  That's good.  Huh?  Contractual obligations.  Fuck, I'm sorry.  And then after we leave, they're going to do another hour. 
[04:33:00]  ONA's daily regurgitation.  Gift to sales.  Extra filler.  We hash.  Gift to sales.  ONA's bulimic purge.  Or for cheap bastards who don't subscribe to XM.  That's kind of funny.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I could care less.  I like bulimic purge and contractual obligation.  He could read all of these and we just mix it up.  Yeah, that's true, too.  You're not going to stay with one name.  No, but he's got... 
[04:33:30]  They only have like five lines of crap they can have him do.  Yeah.  I'll get as much out of him as I can.  Five lines?  He's that good?  Fuck him.  Steve will do 500.  Thank you.  Shut up.  Roland, what do you got?  Nina Savari wants to come in.  Who's that?  She's that giant-headed alien-looking girl.  With a great ass.  With a good ass.  Oh my God, I got a great story about her.  Did I ever tell you the time? 
[04:34:00]  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony. </pre>
