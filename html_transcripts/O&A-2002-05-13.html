<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a discussion about the commuting woes of Long Island residents, punctuated by listener anecdotes.  This transitioned unexpectedly to a conversation with Andy Gore, a collector of macabre artifacts.  Gore detailed his collection, which included items from notorious crime scenes (like a grate from the Sharon Tate murder scene), casts of Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff's faces, preserved sideshow specimens, and various items related to serial killers like Richard Ramirez and John Wayne Gacy.  Callers contributed stories of bizarre roadside incidents and discussed other infamous criminals.  Steve, a frequent contributor, promoted photos and videos from recent Opie and Anthony events on foundrymusic.com, including images of a dead monkey in a Hummer and pictures of Taylor from the "Naughty 90's" contest. The discussion of Gore's collection continued throughout the show, with plans for future segments focusing on it.  Gore defended his collecting, comparing it to other historical artifact collecting, and discussed the challenges of selling his items online due to restrictions.  He also spoke about his work as a tattoo artist.  A caller challenged Gore's morality, prompting a discussion about the morbid fascination with crime and death,  touching on the crimes of Albert Fish and the murder of Lobster Boy. The hosts and Gore even discussed the possibility of a "Cribs"-style segment featuring his collection.

The show then shifted to a segment detailing items received from Chuck Farnahm, another collector of bizarre items, including a human finger bone necklace and pube hair bracelets.  Opie shared a personal anecdote about a woman who enjoys being punched hard in the breasts.  A sound-guessing game followed, revealed to be Ben (a staffer) snoring loudly in D.C. A song parody about Cubans drowning was played, followed by a discussion of one-hit wonders.

A countdown of overplayed songs formed the next segment, interspersed with numerous tangents and calls. This segment included homophobic and misogynistic remarks from the hosts, using derogatory language to describe various artists and situations. The countdown featured songs like "Macarena," "I'm Too Sexy," and "Come On Eileen," with discussions about "Who Let the Dogs Out" and its Mets parody, and a crude description of an early MTV music video.  The hosts offensively mocked various one-hit wonders and controversial figures like Robert Blake, Susan Smith, and Nancy Reagan.  A significant portion focused on "Stalker Patty," a woman who had been sleeping around the studio, with calls from Eddie Trunk and Patty herself (from a women's shelter). The hosts' reaction to Patty ranged from mockery to begrudging concern.  Opie hinted at an embarrassing past involving a television commercial shoot, promising details later.  Lewis Black was expected but didn't appear as a guest. Numerous other callers contributed shorter segments, diverting from the countdown theme.  The segment ended with teases about future segments including details of Opie's commercial and more about Stalker Patty.

[00:03:00]  all the way back in mother's day traffic to brooklyn sunday night to brooklyn so i had spent the entire  half a week in a vehicle driving at length so uh i'm right i'm pretty much at the end of my journey  we had just picked up some uh some uh jap food if i may say jap went to the uh smithsonian uh  air and space museum so a lot of world war ii stuff and they referred to them and them as japs  a lot i felt good about that so i picked some up driving home i i'm about a half a mile from my 
[00:03:30]  apartment cranking i want to make this last light this mother f one of those black car drivers the  livery cab driver yeah is standing in the middle of the road and i'm gunning it and i swear to god  i looked at my girlfriend and said i'm not slowing down i so want to kill this mother effer and i just  kept going and as he got closer and closer like as i got closer to him and he's getting bigger and 
[00:04:00]  bigger in my windshield and his feet start disappearing under the hood of my car i found  myself not slowing down and he literally like ran jumped out of the way of the car nice as he heard  the doppler effect of my horn  and flipped him off i was like i would have been so happy killing him why was he standing in the middle  of the road he's chatting chatting with a friend of his that's parked on the side of the road instead of 
[00:04:30]  going to the passenger window by the sidewalk and chatting he's standing in my lane chatting and i had  had it i had had it i was coming off being sick and i we were driving so long that i seriously felt i  could honestly take a life and i i almost dead i'm a pussy he run jumped ran jumped whatever you call it  yeah it's a term yeah i any encyclopedia i've given up with driving to long island man 
[00:05:00]  oh you're having that fun you know what what are they gonna tell us you know it's over johnny and  that there's no way they could fix the highways to get from manhattan to long island cut it loose  just cut long island loose we'll make our own city we don't need manhattan anymore it's ridiculous  there is no way to get from the uh suburbs suburbs of long island to new york city  in an easy fashion you never know if you take you an hour it could take you three hours  it's mostly take three or four hours yeah now if you live north of the city you have plenty of 
[00:05:30]  little ways to get around if you live in jersey same situation long island is just effed unless they  come up with some kind of eight lane super highway they might as well just cut it loose and let us uh  live our own lives on long island we'll build up a whole new city you guys have fun out there i was  miserable uh mother's day out there uh like i'm talking way out there doesn't people in other  cities don't know but it's you know exit it's a route 112 out there way out on long island and it 
[00:06:00]  took me normally if i drove the way i usually drive and no one's on the road it could take uh it would  take about an hour i guess an hour to get back to brooklyn um well over two hours almost three hours  later and that was considered a quick holiday trip we do this around christmas time or something  forget about it you're talking four five hours to do the drive just sitting in constant bumper to  bumper traffic going like 20 miles an hour people are walking faster than you there's no cure for it  that that island is effed long island sucks it does it's a country to drive it's awful it just sucks to 
[00:06:30]  get from manhattan to long island you can leave uh manhattan at like one in the morning and there's  traffic yeah there's traffic to long island but if you leave manhattan go to jersey or uh you know up  north there in westchester or connecticut it's a piece of cake there is no balance between the  goody goodies that want to preserve long island for what it is and was and whatnot and the people  that have to commute it is a suburb of the biggest city in the world you know you can't have it both 
[00:07:00]  ways the lovely parkways of long island oh they're known across the country built in 1903 uh they were  made to carry your family on these nice little drives and it looks like a park you're driving  through as far as being efficient for commuting no wrong redo them make them five lanes wide  take up all that nice grass that the puerto ricans barbecue on during the summer and let's get some  real highways going there that'll never happen too many goody goodies you might hurt the 
[00:07:30]  ungwaku bird that's indigenous to the curbs what is there in long island of historical nothing  stop are you kidding you talk to long islanders they'll kill you the what there's nothing oh it's  so i mean they're not in new jersey to preserve either what is there in long island to preserve  uh a little like little birds like little uh pipers i think stop it what little piper birds  something like that you know the only thing they're good for is those squish videos that they  were selling on the net vanderbilt built uh all the parkways out there wonderful him and robert 
[00:08:00]  moses wow yeah and they're they're beautiful roadways yeah that are constantly the bridges  aren't high enough for trucks to drive on there so when a truck inadvertently takes that road it  clogs up traffic for another five hours while they pry it out from under a five foot high bridge  southern states blow that's the southern state you're talking about awful it stinks it's left right  left it's always it twists and it turns and every dummy has to slow down oh there's  a turn uh yeah nobody can just go or how about the on ramps that are about three feet long 
[00:08:30]  you gotta explain that uh for other cities because that is insane here there's no there's no uh on  ramps there's no on ramp you got you get on you it says something like southern state parkway entrance  you go on the entrance ramp and i swear to you right then and there boom here's here's the parkway  merge it was made in the early 1900s when occasionally  you know every hour maybe there was somebody passing by that on ramp now it's you know 70 miles 
[00:09:00]  an hour now i'm surprised there aren't more you know crazy accidents on those parkways there is no  merge lane you're so right not only that the entrance part it loops so now you have a 360 degree turn  that you can't do any more than 25 miles an hour on right so you can't build up your speed on that  part of the entrance try to sneak in between two cars going 70 miles an hour and then it just turns  into major traffic 
[00:09:30]  hey look here's the highway go go you're paralyzed go but you know something you got to know how to get on  these roads you got to just goose that son of a bitch and let her fly and uh kind of look and see  what's coming because people will get on and just stop there dead stop and you see them turn their heads  and look for an opening at 70 miles an hour they are awful but they can't change them because the  historic society comes out and says no it's beautiful yeah what else should we do with the 
[00:10:00]  historic society should we still sell black people you dummies let it go it's a new day and age no one  cares horrible michael what's up hey how's it going hey yeah i'm a civil engineering student at  columbia university yeah yeah i i took a traffic engineering class like it just discusses you know  you know traffic flow and you know all that stuff and we did a discussion about you know long island  and how it's like a joke yeah and they're talking about like you know parsons burkenau which is like 
[00:10:30]  a big uh civil engineering firm in the city like they actually did a study on how to solve the problem  and the best thing they could come up with is just simply why in the highway lane the thing is  they can't do it there's no way they can do it because you're mentioning all like you know the  historical stuff you know like yeah well that's just that they won't allow them to do anything  because basically there's no hope for long island between manhattan and uh and long island here's  here's one of the best things when uh remember when shoreham nuclear power plant was out on long  island and the people that built it actually had uh some type of evacuation plan it's way out on 
[00:11:00]  long island waiting river and yet they said no there's there's a way because everybody was saying  look if there's an accident at shoreham there's no effing way you're going to be able to evacuate long  island no the the highways will be used as a but you can't even commute on a daily basis now take  all those people in a nuclear panic everyone running for their cars at the same time trying  to run for their lives it was ridiculous it got so ridiculous that that was why they they closed 
[00:11:30]  shoreham down but there's they had all kinds of theories well we'll have ferry boats that'll take you  to connecticut you could just go to connecticut across the sound yeah and how are you going to  get to the ferries just people screaming you wouldn't get two feet all glowing in the dark  get it the only place i've ever driven worse than long island is route 22 in new jersey  is the only road that is more disgraceful really i can't i've never driven anywhere it's a disgrace 
[00:12:00]  as bad as uh long island traffic wise it's not as bad but just emerging is more dangerous california  gets really bad with the freeways traffic but at least you know they got what is that 18 freaking  lanes wide i love it i love when i gotta go blink blink blink blink blink blink blink and i'm just  trying to work my way to the fast lane and it takes you like five minutes just to get there but  you know once you get there you're moving that's what you need you have three goddamn lanes going to 
[00:12:30]  manhattan here's tom tom what's up you guys are messing tools man i'm on the i'm on the sudden  stay right now cursing and screaming because of the traffic i'm in the right lane because i can't  get to the goddamn left lane and you guys think it's funny i don't have enough pot in the car to get  through this there you go it's two lanes and you never want to be in the right lane because everyone's  trying to get merge into that uh yeah yeah hey hey i'm on that uh it took me an hour again from exit  17 to peninsula exit 19. yeah good luck in your little cushy radio chair junking about it you 
[00:13:00]  dick hey i drive in every day oh yeah hey dude what is the longest stretch of road that doesn't curve  it's got to be about what 40 feet it's all left and right it's like a chicane from a goddamn race  like you have to go all the way to suffix to get a lane a road that's longer than 15 feet it's  terrible all turns and then one thing they did they actually wised up because this was a great hazard  they used to in the median strip between the uh east and westbound lanes they decided to put gas 
[00:13:30]  stations oh yeah remember the guy and again in those days when maybe one guy goes hey buddy fill  her up ethel you know what i mean then you'd get in there and then one guy would be there pumping gas  and then you could pull back out on the highway now these gas stations they finally had to close  down because they were ridiculously dangerous now now you got people coming from the left and right  the only way to get no merge lane from the gas station in the center median back onto the highway was 
[00:14:00]  another two foot long entrance ramp into the left lane of traffic so now people are flying at 80 you have  your nice full tank of explosives and you're gonna wheel in front of someone doing 80. it was beautiful  i love it here i am gas me up you want a crank starter phil  dustin from pa what's up man i just wanted did you already get my thing about the uh about how 
[00:14:30]  pennsylvania has the worst roads in the world uh pa yeah uh you know the word and what's even worse is  that the roads would actually be good if people aren't constantly doing everything on them like you  know i'm like i'm trying to get to school and there are kids driving in the middle of the road with  their bikes never mind that there's like a four hundred pound car coming down on them a four 
[00:15:00]  hundred pound car a car i don't know why that's a light car he doesn't know what's it made out of  sir paper mache get a hold of yourself you're having a breakdown all right dustin thank you you're  welcome relax dustin put on a trench coat go to school i did notice uh philly had a few odd things  going on there was one strip um where they decide they they park in the middle of the road like  there's a median strip that normally might might be used during the day as a left turn lane and at  night their cars just park there they just park in the middle of the street it's a like a major road 
[00:15:30]  so you park and you gotta get a and then washington i noticed in dc driving back well the beltway is a  cute little road the beltway just f's you i swear to god when you look and you're on 495 and you're  heading south and then you look up and you've had a nice chat with jim norton for a while and you look  up and why am i now on 495 going north i look at my little compass on my truck i'm like hey we're 
[00:16:00]  heading north now i'm flying by instrument and i was pissed and then i realized we had uh circled you  had to go the entire beltway but washington also has these things where there's signs that say  between the hours of 7 a.m and 9 p.m or 9 a.m this is a three lane heading this way and then it's two  lanes heading this way and one way so if you're off by the time you're going to get in a head-on collision  you don't keep your watch set right you are so miserable it was actually really entertaining to  watch from the back because we made this one awful move we're almost at the hotel and there was some 
[00:16:30]  last time we had to make it a tricky one and we miss it we're on this windy dark awful road and he  just goes into rage and we get back yeah we were in dc we were right near the hotel i mean there's the  monuments the white house everything and i'm going okay at least i know we're close dc isn't huge uh  we take this one turn all of a sudden no more dc no more monuments pitch black in the woods over a  bridge over over the bridge we're in the woods i'm driving going i can't ever believe this 
[00:17:00]  like screaming i'm hitting things there's a fog like an american werewolf in london on the moors  a fog that i could not see anything actually we we came up on a bridge it looked like we drove under  a brontosaurus i swear we had gone back in time i took such a wrong turn we had jumped through time  it was horrid and i'm screaming and i'm on the phone with the with the obviously uncircumcised  man who works at the hotel oh jim is on the phone in the back seat with the guy 
[00:17:30]  at the hotel and you were being so nice i had i wanted to punch him i because because he's going  well the effing turn isn't there and i'm like all right well he said take route 66 we did that sea  sucker and it's not here oh i'm yelling i'm yelling because i hear jim going we were supposed to go from  uh 17th street right after 17th street is jefferson and i'm supposed to make a ride on jefferson so i go  past 17th virginia virginia well virginia i i don't see virginia i see nothing we keep going  and then i hear jim on the phone with the guy goes well okay so right after um 17th is is uh virginia 
[00:18:00]  and i'm like wrong he's full of s he's effing lying it is not there and i'm screaming everything  jim said okay sir well you know we're gonna try that out and i'll give you another call um if we  seem to have uh uh misplaced ourselves again misplaced i will choke you and we finally get back  which we were actually we just made the right turn i don't know how we did it we finally got  back and i'm like well look man that could have been a lot worse that was kind of lucky and he's 
[00:18:30]  like we are long beyond the point of being lucky that wasn't lucky you're right i wanted to strangle  you and then beat the guy you were on the phone with with your body i actually thought about that  and i got quite a run yeah me too hey joe what's going on no guys are you out of your mind i'm up here  boston dying because of this big dig it's ridiculous ah okay i gotta give it gotta give  it to boston if you have to circumnavigate the big dig where where you can drive to work uh one way 
[00:19:00]  on one day the next day they completely change the roads on you well because it's completely gone yeah  it's gone there's a bridge there now there's not they have a new temporary uh on ramp yeah one day i  go to get on route one it was uh probably about eleven thirty at night four different detours to  get on route one i still couldn't get on i had to get on to 93 north instead it's ridiculous up  here though and driving in boston is a bitch anyway under ideal conditions everywhere they're all  turning every single which way you don't know where you're going you can't go up a street and 
[00:19:30]  miss a street and then go okay i'll make a right here right here three rights make a left kind of  thing yeah you can't do that in boston you make the left another left all of a sudden it veers  off somewhere and you're gone and lost and then you find yourself in revere  you know how ridiculous the big dig uh project is aunt and i were doing big dig jokes seven years ago  yeah well at least it's coming in on schedule and on budget the most corrupt city in the nation  and it's how many more years how many more years they saying what's that how many more years before 
[00:20:00]  it's complete uh they're saying by 2004 oh they should have let erosion do it it would have been quicker  i'm actually working on the big digs though wait does it go what's it supposed to do go under boston  to avoid traffic what is it yeah all the all the all the highways that are up above ground are going to  be moved underground they widen out all the lanes like five lanes and then they're going to make  then they're going to make pretty parks and stuff above ground yeah so now they've taken all this  time to build temporary roads so they could dig under everything and then once they're done with that 
[00:20:30]  they will tear down all the roads they built and put them where they belong that makes sense doesn't  it oh it makes complete sense in between the six beer lunches that all the big dig guys take easy  and the 20 police details that they need hey listen to this there is more pocket lining going on in  boston than any other nation it is the last bastion of the old like the old southern towns where where  they're there in charge and there's nothing you could do about it like it's like the old speed 
[00:21:00]  traps in the south and you get arrested the arresting officer is also the jailer and the judge you know  what i mean they are all in cahoots up there and no one as far as a national level is is keeping tabs on  anything that's going on in boston they are the most corrupt city and and and commonwealth of  massachusetts other is the most corrupt in the nation and they go unchecked they go unchecked the turnpike  authority with their tolls that was supposed to be eliminated years ago too much money coming in 
[00:21:30]  they're just raising the rules to two dollars hey dude why can't you get a job in the tolls  i got a job on the dig so i'm all set see who'd you know to get it i don't know i just went down i got  the job yeah it's an uncle or a brother that's the only way crap works up there are you irish joey irish  he hangs out he didn't want too much info getting out that is an amazing thing don't get me wrong  i love when people buck the system and the commonwealth of massachusetts has done it let's 
[00:22:00]  go to psycho tim he wants to in on the big uh dig stuff tim what's up gentlemen how's it going all  right man we have one of those big like fox news things a couple months ago where they call the guys  drink i'm sure you guys heard about it down there guy goes into the the a street deli has nine beers  hahaha doesn't eat anything doesn't eat anything they all sit at the table there's like a case of  empty bug balls on the table none of them ate a cracker they go out and they see the same guys like

[00:23:00]  bridge oh really in the rain like the other day they had to let the people in on mother's day it was  the bridge it was packed with like purple yellow ladies walking over the bridge checking it out in  the rain sounds like fun all right well i'm gonna go to the summer when i can drive over it all right  tim thanks all right guys big willy from philly checking in you're talking about parking on broad  street in south philly anthony being italian as you know the situation is a result of former mob boss  angelo bruno he used the politicians in his pockets to have the cops stop ticketing all the locals down 
[00:23:30]  there for parking in the middle of the road he had so many judges and politicians in his pocket in his  pocket let us wet our beaks peter like so many nickels and dimes we got to go back to the long  island thing you were talking about the bridges and how they're uh too short for the trucks and stuff  yeah uh when you're heading toward the beaches and robert moses and all that yep uh ray has an  exit uh uh uh a reason they do this uh ray what's up hey what's wrong guys hey bro listen i read an 
[00:24:00]  article about three years ago when they were redoing northern state it was a news day robert moses  guiding cahoots with with the for the for the parkways he didn't want minorities being bussed  out to the park that he was building that was the story of news day because years ago it was like a  privilege to have to have a uh a car out long island right of course yeah so he didn't want minorities  being bussed out to the for the beaches so to keep the black people off of the long island beaches  he built the bridges too low for the buses to get under exactly it was an article in news day man 
[00:24:30]  you know there's another guy that's saying the same exact thing on line nine  what a genius my apologies  oh my god is that hysterical the buses were that tall back then because now the buses go right  under um no buses go on the parkway oh that's true no buses go on the parkway although they can't  make a bridge low enough for toyota corollas to keep them off the beach these days because how many times 
[00:25:00]  you walk down robert moses and almost step in a goddamn crappy baby diaper isn't that fantastic  when when uh uh certain families of certain ethnic backgrounds will bring their 20 kids like cats  in a big sandbox just bury it all right maybe he had a point  who knew we're gonna break anthony hey that bridge look kind of low  uh well i just want to go to the beach perhaps you should uh slow down i see a 
[00:25:30]  what's that say nine foot five clearance and the bus oh  he had a point all right talking about traffic for a half hour  why not fun for you hey uh we're gonna take a break and uh and we'll continue with this mess okay  yoi lots and lots of stuff to get to today uh the the softball game is just about sold out anthony  right so if you're looking at well we'll get into the details next how's that who would have 
[00:26:00]  we're still stupid well if that's what it takes to get good ratings we'll continue being stupid  we don't we don't care we don't care i've been expecting you to make exactly that asinine  the opie and anthony show theater of the mindless  seven dust on the opie and anthony show  it's going to be home in new york city anthony yeah we hit the road what wednesday uh after the radio

[00:34:00]  next thing you know i don't know where i am anymore and all of a sudden i'm going up into  this guy's apartment i was scared i was scared to go up there yes satansideshow.com thank you steve  that's his website and i go upstairs and i saw some really cool stuff and i just don't know what i  could talk about huh he had a kiss pinball machine right at the top of the stairs oh well there you go  i guess you could talk about that but that you know those are really rare yeah all the rock stars 
[00:34:30]  are trying to get their hands on these things he's got one in pristine condition pristine pristine  condition and he has all sorts of sideshow stuff and other things i'm sorry i'm just looking at  taylor's pictures i can tell you this much he showed me some of john wayne gacy's artwork oh he does  have some some of that hey that's a collector's item yeah i heard some rich guy bought most of those  uh and burned them some really yeah but a lot of his original artwork and just burned it in a pile 
[00:35:00]  and that brilliant make the ones that are out there even more valuable well there's a lot of  guys like uh you know andy gore out there that want to collect this stuff from serial killers and  stuff and he uh and he said like ebay and all that is just completely shutting down the business  and real and all the uh you know all the gels and stuff they they just will not allow you to  come you know to to to contact these people it's called i think right where you can't profit off your  own crime yeah but if they're profiting it's one thing if they just want to send you something they  are just knocking the communication out of the mix where they don't even want you to get a hold 
[00:35:30]  of them anymore it is kind of sick when you think about it so i was supposed to be there for like 15  minutes i was there for like two hours and i mean i'll tell you what i saw i just got it i just got  to get this guy on the phone and i don't want to blow up his spot what about his ramirez's sunglasses  which he brought on the air how great were those little tidbits of serial killers yeah pretty cool  those cool glasses he wore in court oh my god bludgeoning 80 year olds with a lamp he's trying  to buy do you not love richard ramirez i think i can tell you this much he's in he's in contact with 
[00:36:00]  so many crazy people he's trying to buy the clothes that gg allen died in really but uh i guess the  brother or some family member wants like five thousand dollars and he's like screw that it's not worth  five thousand dollars okay merle merle's brother rap merle allen his brother right right right  so probably covered with feces that he would throw at the crowd anyway a lot of the stuff he  brought down to the radio station in dc it they're now up on foundrymusic.com including the picture 
[00:36:30]  of the cyclops baby the one thing he did talk about on the air was that uh did you see this he  and he spoke about it on the air so i guess we could talk about it the uh fish tank all right if  he mentioned that then i could i get it on here you talk about that help me out because i don't  remember what he said on our show as long as he said on the show i guess i could talk about  yeah he has a uh a fish tank and in the fish tank is siamese twins with diapers on them  laying in this fish tank like a like a fish tank like this so what yeah like 18 inches by 
[00:37:00]  10 gallon tank probably probably like a 10 gallon tank yeah and uh preservative and he told the story  on the air the reason uh the siamese twins have diapers on is because you know this was in the  sideshows yeah but a lot of people said it was obscene because the siamese twins had really large  uh yam bags and junk in general so they're like that's obscene you can't show that yeah so then  uh you know the sideshow corny whatever he uh decided well i could i could keep showing it if i 
[00:37:30]  put diapers on these things i think it's sicker with the diapers on it it's really twisted really effing  twisted and the original chains and locks are on this thing because they were so valuable that uh  you know people were stealing them all the time yeah they had to chain them down so the sideshow  people would lock them up after after they showed it but this uh particular display with the uh siamese  twins was uh seen by millions of people all over the world really millions and now he has them  there's more there's more stuff i want to tell you guys but i don't want to blow up his spot how do you 
[00:38:00]  some stuff that will blow you away how do you even uh sleep in the same house yeah as that stuff  like that would just creep me out especially knowing those two big delicious mules were there  no one it was creepy because he he takes off the black like uh he had like a black cloth on it  oh he gives a little show i was just blown away man it's like a little show then i was completely blown  away that's cool so huh say people love this morbid stuff man like christopher reeve you read in the 
[00:38:30]  paper it's on the prep sheet he can't sell his bike no no no he keeps selling it to the same guy and  the guy uh buys the bike yeah it's for a charity thing and then the guy keeps giving the bike back  to christopher reeve oh all right which is pretty sick if you think about it yeah yeah maybe maybe he  wants to get rid of it not be reminded of the fact that he used to be able to pedal yeah christopher  reeves i know christopher reeves is the he's thinking it's a good move by this guy because  he sells it in uh at an auction or something for a charity right and the guy's like well yeah i'll 
[00:39:00]  buy the bike he buys it every year and then gives it back to christopher reeves and that's that's a  sick f yeah he's also why not buy the bike give it to someone else and then just give christopher  reeves charity you get whatever a couple million dollars every year every year you give him some  charity not like christopher reeves probably i just want to get rid of this bike  it reminds me of when i used to be able to pedal but the son of a bitch keeps giving it back to me  sell his wheelchair now that's some stunt hey i won't give it back just watch him lay there 
[00:39:30]  whatever money you make you just hire someone to carry around on his back  like a little monkey i'm on the satansideshow.com page he's got a lot of uh ed game stuff was a great  serial killer used to um skin women and he was making a woman's suit dude he told me something  i need to talk to him well why you you got some uh info here he uh well he asked me if this if i

[00:47:00]  he just just vicious sop he really was give well give the audience a little example of what he was  all about he terrorized la in the 80s and he did it all for satan um would listen to acdc get all hyped up  on uh coke and just go out and kill he would just be driving on the freeway and just see somebody and  decide hey i think i'll kill her just completely random completely brutal and he would tuck his 
[00:47:30]  pants into his socks yeah he didn't knock anything over climbing through a window he bludgeoned two  eighty-year-old women to death with a lamp wow just great look at norton knowing a little bit about the  man and he also who's the dude he broke into one house and he shot the husband while he was on the  couch yeah he did that and uh with a put a 22 up to his head while the husband's sleeping and then  raped the wife next to the corpse well the well the wife tried to shoot him because there was a  gun under oh yeah yeah and she pulled out a shotgun and aimed it and pulled the trigger it went click 
[00:48:00]  because he had his stupid grandchildren over earlier during the week and unloaded the gun  oh right so she fired an unloaded gun at the knife and got raped that girl that he did it for some  satanic reason he actually uh took a knife out of their kitchen and after she was dead he cut her eyes  out wow that i did not know and saved them in a um a jewel box don't that make your brown eyes blue  what a sicko he was walking to the public turned him into a certain degree didn't he was walking

[00:53:00]  in her own home he violated the body yeah wow he sounds like a real great guy and then he cut his mother's  head off or he killed her and then he invited her best friend over to plan a birthday party for the  mother and when the friend got there he strangled her too holy yes you that's right anyhow and didn't  he eat a dinner with a head in a bowling bag with his mother yeah yeah temper is so cool man i had  the bowling bag uh and android killer he was called andrew you communicate with uh an ex-serial killer right 
[00:53:30]  yeah in fact this guy just got out of out of jail he's from france go figure and uh he was the  vampire of paris the vampire of paris of paris and what he did was you know he was i guess one of  these goth goth guys that uh took it one step further and you know can and he worked in a mortuary  with like cut strips of meat off the uh you know the people he was prepping for burial go home and cook 
[00:54:00]  gum and you know drink blood uh he was like the real real deal and he ended up killing i don't  know how many people people he killed but i know he killed at least one like shot the guy five times  in the head and beat him with a the leg of a chair but mostly he was into cutting pieces of the body at  the mortuary bringing yeah yeah he was really into grave robin and then he uh he collected the the blood  and stuff right yeah found a lot of blood in his place yeah when they busted they found all this 
[00:54:30]  blood that he would drink and uh so i was pretty surprised i sat down on my on my computer one  morning and i get an email from him and he was like oh i saw your site your stuff is great and i'm like  jesus christ and uh and he has a website now that i got up on and uh he put a link to my website on his  website and now he wants to communicate with you a little bit yeah now um why only seven years for  this guy uh he was in a mental hospital oh well there you go let him go after so he's all better

[00:55:30]  drove her to the mountains taped her mouth and tried to suffocate her by putting his thumb and index  finger over her nostrils after taping the mouth that's pretty god awful right there she fought and  lost consciousness only to awaken moments later she uh was suffocated again until she stopped  breathing completely he then removed her from the car later on the guy raped her after she's dead  then with her own scarf strangled her even though after she's dead uh to make sure she was dead then 
[00:56:00]  put her in the trunk of the car and drove away went to a local bar to have a couple of beers and then  went to his mom's house from time to time he would just go out to the car open the trunk and take a  look take a little look see at his conquest until he decided to uh dissect her chop her head and hands  off and throw her in various locations yeah he's a classic oh very efficient uh pepper's bright too they  said yeah jerry knows who uh peewee gaskin is jerry oh cool jerry yeah all right what's up you got uh

[01:02:00]  millions of people have seen oh yeah he's talking about the serial killer stuff all the serial killer  stuff ed uh adam well the same thing with that i mean there were crime shows all over the gangster  era when they would show like uh they had um john dillinger's family put up on display right after he  got killed uh pictures of of of him in the morgue and it was called a crime show they even showed ed  geene's car i mean yeah but you to lay down and put tape around yourself well that's a shattering tape 
[01:02:30]  murders oh i didn't put tape around myself i had a pillow up my shirt to to so it looked like i was  pregnant no and they said then you etched yourself out no he he laid in the same exact position she  was found and got a little souvenir yeah that's normal guys come on all right that is i'll give  that a little on adam i never said it was normal but this is you know this this is uh some of the  things that are going on in our world it was i hope the fbi is listening and has a good file on this  guy yourself the fbi no dude i'm an international artist i don't oh my he's an uh adam adam made a 
[01:03:00]  good point don't be so melodramatic the fbi and god you know it it becomes part of pop culture some of  these things right absolutely it was just funny the way he said well didn't you pull out a draw an  outline and andrew's like no i made myself look pregnant and laid down like anything else would have  been silly right to simulate the pregnancy and lie at the murder scene is fine damn i just got a  really bizarre twisted sense of humor and uh if you don't like it you know tough you can lump it 
[01:03:30]  yeah exactly i didn't mean to get so harsh but uh kyle wants to know if you have anything from the  zodiac the zodiac killer no he's never been caught actually right by the way this is only a small  part of uh what andrew does yeah i mean the crime stuff is cool and that gets me a lot of press and  recognition but uh uh you know just the whole side to a thing is where it's really at for me these  days but they're really shutting that stuff down aren't they oh uh the crime stuff yeah i mean oh  yeah you can't communicate banned on ebay and uh and you can't communicate as easily with these 
[01:04:00]  no i mean i i pretty much quit my communication years ago i mean the whole crime thing kind of  ran its course with me yeah um because there's not that much you know there's only so many things you  can learn about richard ramirez and it's you know it's interesting and it's like this is sick and  stuff you here in new york city you can't drive by the dakota building without people taking their  pictures in front of the dakota where john was shot i mean it's it becomes part of pop culture and and  and people are interested in this stuff exactly and i when we were in l.a we had to go to where uh 
[01:04:30]  nicole and uh and uh what's his name i forgot his name ron goldman were murdered and then we went  to oj's house and got a picture on right in front of his house yeah there's a morbid fascination with  this stuff and it's like people taking their pictures down on ground zero you know and to the  guy telling you something like uh hey you know have you ever had kids and they were kidnapped by a  serial killer i mean dude that's ridiculous that you're collecting the paraphernalia makes you evil  i mean if you want to do that then you nobody collect crucifixes if you're so worried right 
[01:05:00]  right oh look at that see take your way back i mean no i just mean what you know last few weeks  what's been going on quick another parish the reality is uh people have a fascination for this  stuff and was they've always had a fascination anthony was talking on this show where his driving  to work is a nightmare because people are just lined up uh taking pictures of ground zero every day  hundreds upon hundreds of people every day yeah everyone's down there with their cameras and camcorders  and everything wanting to take a picture so they could go back to their family and go look see here's 
[01:05:30]  where it happened i was connected to the event right i don't mind people looking or going there  because to me it just makes you want to bomb those animals even more so go take a look yeah but just  don't clog up traffic you nosy nudges by the way there's a uh article in the new york post today uh  there was a baby found in a jar right here in new york get out yeah really yeah where's the post cool  i guess some lady died and they were cleaning out her place and uh they found a baby in a jar  in like the closet or something and i guess it would be in a jar i guess it was pretty old yeah 
[01:06:00]  i mean there's a lot that you know there's a lot of those out there like doctors um you know have  them you know they're antiques it's not like anybody's going out and killing these little guys  antiques yeah how much time has to go by before it's an antique yeah i had no idea where you could  just plop a dead baby in a jar and not have it be a crime i mean the ones i got my hands on are  all they're all from an old old side shows right yeah yeah what about uh mummies you know how about 
[01:06:30]  mummies just because more time goes by it's okay to have a dead person uh on display in a museum yeah  exactly i mean there's medical museums you know all over the country and med schools with these things  in jars being shown and uh i just don't see a problem with it to be honest with you and they were  buried uh out of religious uh the pharaohs and stuff were buried out of religious uh purpose with  all these things now we're just running in going hey look at how neat this is now if you went in and 
[01:07:00]  did that to a church or a temple today you'd be arrested right but it's considered uh acceptable  if it's x amount of years old a lot of people are saying that we should have uh cribs with andrew's  place oh jeez have you seen the other uh versions of cribs we've done andrew no i haven't seen it  it's unbelievable we did stalker patty's place we did jim norton's place we did uh sandy kane's  place yeah that sounds like it could be fun andrew would you be up for it sure wow that would be  cool we wouldn't show your face and no one would really know where you lived or anything or where

[01:40:00]  I just want to  tussle the mess  well  um  have you ever heard  a snore like that sir  what's that  have you ever heard  a snore like that  um  my dad  he's the worst snore  I've ever heard  sounds like a  TIE fighter  is it someone snoring  from this past weekend  in DC  oh  oh  wow  oh  wow  now what would make 
[01:40:30]  you say that  um  cause you could hear  like someone with a tape  you could hear the tape recorder  turning off  wow  towards the end of the  towards the end of the snore  I told you  and there's this one point  where the snore goes  from a high pitch  to a real low  like the diaphragm  in the throat  just opening and closing  alright  Jesus  you get  where were you  when Kennedy got shot  um  I'm born in 78 man  Brian you get  one guess  oh  okay  you're giving him  everything you have said  so far has been  uh 
[01:41:00]  correct  wow  so it's gotta be  the person  oh  now you're gonna  give him one guess  oh come on  you said guess the sound  no no  that we have to  you have to hit it exact  I will probably  take care of you anyway  but who would you guess  oh son of a bitch  Voss isn't that ignorant  could be the whole audience  watching him  I don't know  um  I'm gonna have to  take a shot  and say stanky  did I get the closest 
[01:41:30]  are we gonna take care  of him anyway  uh Brian  you were so good  at being Sherlock Holmes  we're gonna give you  a pair of tickets anyway  thank you so much guys  you guys rock  I wouldn't have given it  to him  why  because  he missed the guess  no everything else  he said though  you know  he was good  doesn't matter  how can you guess  who it really is  listen closely  perhaps you can guess  and I'll tell you why 
[01:42:00]  I disagree  only because this guy  gave so many clues  that for anybody else  that calls in  it's just guessing  a name  as opposed to  the guy nailed everything  I mean it's not like  just sleeping  and you hear  alcohol  he knew it was taped  in D.C.  yeah  okay  alright 
[01:42:30]  you got the right  state or district  so what are we gonna do  just let people guess  uh Pete what's going on  hey guys  hey  hey uh  is it a uh  is it a retard in D.C.  licking an ice cream cone  no  no  alright see it  these idiots  listen to this guy  Brian what's up  hey  is it uh  Opie's stomach  after he's crumbling  after you missed  his mid-show yogurt  his little treat  you're a dick  a mid-show treat

[01:43:30]  ever  more importantly  if you listen closely  to the show  everyone knows  that Jim doesn't bunk up  I sleep alone  ah  is that a clue  that's a clue  he went off  on the fact  that he never  bunks up  who doesn't  bunk up  on the show  let's go to Diablo  Diablo  yo  what up  it's gotta be Paddy  Paddy  Paddy  it was  the other guy  said it was  recorded in DC  we said all that  was true  we didn't bring  Paddy to the DC  oh man  sorry 
[01:44:00]  alright  no it's not  Anthony  with a cold  nope  someone already  guessed  a vase  let's go to  Aaron  Aaron  hey what's up guys  what's up  originally I thought  it was  one of Ben's  drunken phone calls  to you  at 3 in the morning  yeah  but I think  it's Ben snoring  oh is it  Ben snoring  our own Ben  it is Ben  yes  oh my god 
[01:44:30]  Ben  yep  get Awesome  Garrett in here  because he is  the one that  recorded this  Awesome Garrett  recorded because  him and Ben  were bunking up  together  and Awesome  Garrett was  so pissed  off  and he had  all the equipment  from when we were  doing our broadcast  and I said  screw it  I gotta tape this  dude I called  on my cell phone  I called my  messages  and just held  my cell phone up  is that what it is  fourth generation  that loud  that was so  loud 
[01:45:00]  and annoying  Ben do you  know you snore  like that  when uh  in occasions  when we've been  out like three  nights and get  about three or  four hours of  sleep  yeah  yeah  definitely  wow  that's what it  was  that's like  we were out  Wednesday night  to like three  in the morning  Thursday night  to three in  the morning  Friday night  whenever we got  back  and then I  just passed  out  that is just  a sick  sound though  it doesn't  sound like a  snore  no  I just think  you're yelling  and screaming  and saying  wake the F up  put it this way  it was so great  like one week  we had like a  crazy week  I don't know 
[01:45:30]  when it was  way back  we had like  a couple events  that week  and up at my  ski house  I got my own  our ski house  is like 30 people  and we had had  a crazy week  like that  and I were  going to sleep  all week  I cleared out  my whole wing  of the ski house  my own room  in the ski house  no one else  around  but yeah  if I go  if I have a  week with  not a lot of  sleep  that's what  what does that  have to do  with being  tuckered out  have to do  with sounding  like a seal  being cootally  raked  clubbed  listen again  this is Ben  snoring  in DC  he couldn't even 
[01:46:00]  wake me up  he couldn't even  wake me up  I was out  Ben shut up  I was like  hitting my bed  I was getting up  how loud  yell how loud  you told me  shut up  I was like  Ben  shut the F up  and he wouldn't  wake up  I was like  I was like 
[01:46:30]  it was an hour  and a half  and I was so  pissed and tired  you know what's  great about this  I'll get my own  room on the next  trip  because none of  you guys  want to stay  with me  but Stinky  did he wake  up in the middle  of the night  and start giggling  to himself  that's the best  because I used  to crash at  Ben's place  in the city  when we first  moved back  to New York  and we'd have  the late  appearances  and stuff  and I would  just crash  it was cool  to hang out  with Ben  and stuff  and he would  have this  type of snoring  going on  but then  he would  throw in  a few laughs  and giggles  in the middle  of the night  as well  he was finding 
[01:47:00]  something funny  in his sleep  and he would  just openly  laugh and giggle  you also couldn't  believe it  because the phone  at my house  would just ring  like non-stop  2, 3, 4, 5  in the morning  and you'd be like  who the F is  calling you  and you'd be  these idiots  I know in Boston  like dude  are you up  what are you doing  you know  why would you laugh  were you dreaming  about being tickled  that's pretty funny  now the sounds  of Baby Seal  being beaten  that's the worst 
[01:47:30]  noise I've ever heard  that's pretty bad  imagine being five feet  away from that sound  it had to be really loud  too right  I went to the bathroom  like maybe I could  sleep in the bathroom  or something  oh my god  in the balcony  I went on the balcony  I closed the glass 
[01:48:00]  sliding glass door  still here  I thought people  next door  were going to complain  oh my god  and finally  I threw a pillow  on his face  and he was snoring  through the pillow  put his head  like back up  on the pillow  and finally like  shifted  and stopped  and you effed up  everyone's wire taps  at the water game  yeah  couldn't get anything done  what's this sound  it's the commie code  well that's classic  very good 
[01:48:30]  snoring brings out  such a rage  when you're in the room  with someone  I rebunked with Voss  years ago  he does that  he's awful  just that awful  awful apnea  and you just want  to stick a knife  in them  it's like  the mother effer  would just stop  the ones that go  Voss is the worst  how about the ones  that pause  to the point  you think they're dead  you're hoping  so they don't  keep you awake anymore  and then they  let it go  you know 
[01:49:00]  you remember  the guy  on the train back  on the train back  that was sitting next to us  that was snoring up a storm  on the way back  on Saturday  was he snoring  oh yeah yeah yeah  he was  shh  shh  snoring's always funny  but it brings out  like you really want  to murder someone  just because  they're doing it on purpose  they're nerving them  dirty sea suckers  stop it  alright well  Aaron  yo  hold on the line  you got a pair of tickets  to the celebrity softball game  alright cool guys  thanks  good guess bro  thanks man 
[01:49:30]  a drunken Ben  snoring  good job  want to hear it one more time  one more time  oops  here we go  I bet you Ben snores like that 
[01:50:00]  cause all the blood is rushing  to that watermelon sized bulge  the front of his trousers  fine  I don't care  I'll get no room like you  out in the next one  this could work out  for the best  dude I have to  that's why I have to  I can't sleep  if someone's snoring  you know who else  snores really bad  is my friend  drunk German Ed  with a bullet hole  in his head  he  if you think that's bad  he is a hundred times  he cleared out a whole  three floor house  a couple years ago  yeah but the guy  had a bullet in his head  yeah  well  it's drunk German Ed  with a bullet hole  in his head  but  it's pretty funny 
[01:50:30]  alright  we'll step aside  Ed  in honor of  Jimmy Carter  going down there  to Cuba  down to Cuba  meeting with  Fidel Castro  how about that  huh  I'm sure that'll  make a lot of  things change  he gets things done  oh stop it  here's a little song  for Carter  and Cuba  and everybody else  drown drown  cubans drown  drown  cubans drown  yeah  cubans drown  drown  drown  cubans drown  turn around  cubans drown  drown

[01:52:30]  O.P. and Anthem.  Our adult fantasy playroom is open.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  A pretty good one today, too. 
[01:53:00]  Having fun.  Still got to talk about cheating at work.  Big article in the paper today.  Seems a lot of people doing it.  Seems like everyone's doing it.  Dan from Hoboken says, I don't know what sounds worse.  Been snoring or Air 6 lame Cuban song.  Hey, Dan.  That was me and Joe with the rest of the guys in Rot Gut.  And Hugo.  Hugo from the lead singer of Evolution.  The Journey Tribute Band. 
[01:53:30]  The Journey Tribute Band.  Doing the high parts.  There was a lot of talent involved with that song.  A lot of people.  And that was a one shot recorded live.  All the harmonies live and everything.  So screw you, Dan.  Airsick.  It's kind of like Anthony's disco duck.  Right.  They're not all electric shock OJ.  Anthony wanted to be as famous as Rick Deeds as far as doing a one-hit wonder wacky song parody.  And there was his one-hit wonder. 
[01:54:00]  Disco.  Disco duck.  Pac-Man fever.  Pac-Man fever.  One of the best shows on TV the last weekend.  The one-hit wonder show on V221.  Oh, my God.  I was watching that.  It's like someone said it's like a hundred mini behind the musics.  Yeah.  Because it's all people that had one hit and then just disappeared.  You know what I was laughing at, though?  Who's that chick that does that?  I'm a bitch.  I'm a blah, blah, blah.  They actually were like, she's a one-hit wonder with that song. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  I'm thinking, gee, give her a couple of months more at least.  That song is probably three years older.  I know.  But three years.  All right.  You know, you go back into some of the people in the 80s, you know, the Vapors.  I think I'm turning Japanese.  You can pretty much say, I don't see another hit coming out of the Vapors.  I just don't see it happening.  But her, it's like, you know, come on, man.  The song pretty much just came out.  How about Mexican radio?  Is that on there?  I'm on a Mexican radio. 
[01:55:00]  Phenomenal.  I'm on a Mexican radio.  Radio.  Radio.  Radio.  Wall of voodoo.  Radio.  I have it on, I know, Napster.  Wall of voodoo.  Yeah.  How about A-ha?  A-ha was way up there.  I believe one of the top five.  You know what the top five were?  I know what number one is.  I was way at the bottom of the list.  I had no clue.  I know what number one is.  I was down near the Edie Burkell area.  Were you?  Yeah.  What I am is what I am is what you want to want.  I believe number one. 
[01:55:30]  Do you have the top five?  I'll see if I can get it because I think I know where it is.  They're running the damn thing over and over again, but it's like a four-hour special or  something.  I haven't gotten close to the...  Top five what?  Top five one-hit wonders of all time.  Might be the worst or the best.  I guess they would have to be the best ones, right, Ed?  Yeah.  I could get it out of my email real quick.  They had the Convoy song?  Convoy.  It's like we have ourselves a convoy.  Let me get it quick before everybody...  Oh, you're getting the top five?  Yeah.  All right.  I'm going to guess. 
[01:56:00]  Lewis Black for Rick.  That was a Lewis Black one.  How's he been?  Tell him we don't want to talk to him.  He's taking me.  Oh, he can hear us?  Hi, Lewis.  You douche.  Ah.  No, we love you, Lewis.  You should know that.  Just trying to yell and scream at yourself.  Come on.  Coming up.  Here we go.  Is A-ha up there?  I have the whole thing.  The top hundred.  All right.  What do you want?  Give me the...  Just do, like, the top 20.  You want the top 20?  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:56:30]  Coming in at number 20 was Thomas Dolby.  She blinded me with science.  Science!  Science!  Science!  Uh, 19.  Wait, didn't Thomas Dolby have another hit, though?  See, that's the guy.  I was kind of like, wait a minute.  What was it?  She's an airhead, baby.  She's an airhead or something like that.  Something to do with airhead was a pretty big hit.  All right.  Yeah, I guess he didn't have another hit.  There was a lot of artists on there that could have technically had second hits.  Oh, I know.  That's what I thought, too. 
[01:57:00]  Hey, Macarena has to be top five.  Oh, we'll get there.  Devo is up there, no?  But Devo is another one.  Well, Devo.  I know.  I should argue that one, too.  Whip it.  They had Whip it.  They had Devo.  Hold on.  Yeah, Devo had a great version of Satisfaction.  I can't get me no Satisfaction.  Hey, hey, hey.  All right, go ahead.  So 20 was what?  Was Science.  Oh, yeah.  Thomas Dolby.  19.  In a God of DeVita.  Iron Butterfly.  In a God of DeVita.  Wow.  They had nothing else? 
[01:57:30]  No.  Those guys?  Nothing.  No.  No, and then one of the guys becomes this mad scientist math guy.  Right.  And then he got kidnapped or disappeared from the face of the earth.  And killed and stuff.  He knew nuclear secrets and whatnot.  And they're still trying to find him.  Yeah.  He might be alive.  But now he's dead.  I don't know.  They found his skull in a ravine in California.  And then the band went on without him.  It's a whole mess.  Number 18.  Nothing compares to you.  I know.  Sinead had more than one song. 
[01:58:00]  What?  She had Mandinka.  She had the Emperor's New Clothes.  Nothing that's like as big as that song.  But they had other hits.  That's why I'm not agreeing with this.  And I especially do not agree with number 17.  I agree with it.  Nothing compares to you.  It was written by Prince.  Yeah.  It was a duet, actually.  Go ahead.  I do not agree with number 17.  We're not going to take it.  Twisted Sister.  Didn't Twisted Sister have a couple of more?  I want to rock.  Right.  Come on.  I want to rock.  But were they hits, though?  Ridiculous. 
[01:58:30]  I don't think they were hits.  That was a hit.  That was being played a lot.  Gosh, we're white trash.  No, no.  I want to rock.  Do we have Twisted here?  Do we have any Twisted?  I want to rock was huge on MTV.  We're talking about music.  Why isn't Earl running in here?  Usually when we talk about music, Earl runs it.  I want to see that Twisted album and see if there's any other tunes off of it.  Because I know that got huge play.  We're not going to take it.  Thank, thank you.  Earl, what are the songs that Twisted Sister do besides I want to rock and we're not going  to take it?  That's two right there, though. 
[01:59:00]  They did Leader of the Pack.  They did...  Right.  That's right.  That's kind of a hit.  Leader of the Pack was a hit.  That's all the album we got.  Wake Up, Hunt, Love, Hunt.  Oh, jeez.  This album's horrible.  You know, VH1 did a special once called Two Hit Wonders, Anthony.  Yeah, maybe that was it.  They're more of a two hit wonder.  Yeah, I wouldn't put Twisted in that category.  All right.  16, Rapper's Delight.  Sugar Hill Gang.  I said a hip hop, a hippie, a hippie, a hippie, a hippie, a hippie, a hippie, a hippie,  you don't stop, the rock it to the bang, bang, boogers to up, drop the boogers to the 
[01:59:30]  rhythm of the boogers to beat.  Right, Earl?  I'm not saying...  And watch the Knicks play basketball, right?  Right, Earl?  We heard that song so much growing up that we used to sing it backwards.  Oh, really?  Sing that backwards.  You wacky colored.  I couldn't do it now, but...  No, it was just...  How the hell do you sing that backwards?  How do you sing it backwards?  No, I just sung all the verses and rehearsals.  Really?  Because it just got so overplayed.  Mmm.  Didn't they have another hit?  I'm not just saying this.  You sing it backwards and all the black families have happy families and they all have jobs 
[02:00:00]  and MC Master G, Wonder Mike, and Big Bank Hank.  I just got a picture with Wonder Mike.  Yeah?  Line up, ladies.  Hold on.  All right, the one-hit wonder list, Anthony.  Number 15, and the Mysterians, 96 Tears.  Question mark.  Question mark in the Mysterians?  Question mark in the Mysterians, yeah, yeah.  Very good.  Well, whatever.  I don't remember that band.  14, Delight, Groove is in the Heart.  Groove is in the Heart!  13, Van McCoy. 
[02:00:30]  Do the hustle.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,  How about those dudes that used to do the thing about the spinning around the pole?  Me?  Spinning around and around.  No, the safety dance.  Oh, safety dance.  I'm sure that's in there.  It didn't make the top 20, though.  Number 12, Sir Mix-a-Lot, Baby Got Back.  There you go.  Debbie Boone, if you lived any time in the late 70s, if you lived in the late 70s, you  remember, You Light Up My Life. 
[02:01:00]  What an awful song.  Oh, my God.  Sounds like a seal dying when she sang that.  Awful.  Horrible.  Number 10, now the top 10.  Nena, 99 Luftballons.  And then there was a German version of that song.  Yeah.  Wasn't there?  That was a 99 Red Balloon.  No, but it was all in German.  Yeah, that was 99 Luftballons.  That was the German version.  You just said it, like, because Luftballon is not American.  Yeah. 
[02:01:30]  Number 9.  Hold on, this guy knows the rule for one-hit wonder.  Oh, what's the rule, ass?  Mike, what's the rule?  The rule is that you could only have one song that was in the top 10 ever.  You could have other songs that were his, but if one was in the top 10, and only one,  that would sort of make it a one-hit wonder.  Oh, one hit.  That's it.  Yeah, like, under that rule, Hendricks is a one-hit wonder.  I think he was in there.  Hendricks was on the one-hit wonder?  Yeah, Hendricks was a one-hit wonder.  Plus, technically, he was a one-hit wonder.  Oh, see, I'm not believing that rule. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, stop.  That's ridiculous.  I think he should at least be top friggin' five.  That stinks.  That's stupid.  I don't know.  Why, Hendricks was a one-hit wonder.  What did he do, play a little better than average?  No, I'm kidding.  Wow.  Just wanted to annoy people.  I'm going to start some trouble.  I love him.  Again, number nine, who can forget, 1991, Gerardo with Rico.  Suave.  Suave.  Rico.  Tulo.  Tulo.  And coming in at number eight, the band that gets Rick hopping on a transatlantic flight to 
[02:02:30]  England.  Uh-huh.  Take on me.  Take on me.  D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d.  You shouldn't even pay to see them if they're in the Meadowlands, much less get out your  passport.  That is the worst trip I've ever heard of anyone taking.  What's this?  You get the wrong one for me?  Which one's that?  Benny King.  I hit the wrong one for me.  It says, uh-huh.  It's the wrong one.  Yeah, it's the wrong one. 
[02:03:00]  Uh-huh, there.  Number seven, big fan of Club Stinky.  He's been in there.  Vanilla Ice?  Yes, Vanilla Ice, Ice Ice Baby.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Didn't Lewis Black want in on this today?  Is he still on hold?  Yeah, he knew the top five, and it looked like he was going to go off on it.  He did, because he probably sat there and watched the whole thing 20 times like everyone else.  With Bill Shatner hosting.  Number six, Robert Blake. 
[02:03:30]  From the year 2000, of course.  Is Jay Moore on this list?  No.  From the 2002 Celebrity Softball game?  Ouch.  Mr. One for five.  You remember every baseball team adopting this song as their little song at the stadiums.  Who Let the Dogs Out?  Woof, woof, woof.  And, of course, Who Let the Mets Out, which was a huge song for them during the Subway Series. 
[02:04:00]  Which was a huge embarrassment for all us Mets fans.  It certainly was.  Who Let the Mets Out?  Yuck.  Yuck, yuck, yuck.  That's right up there with Meet the Mets, Greet the Mets.  They had the worst songs in the history of sports.  I liked Meet the Mets.  And no, you didn't.  Yes, how you doing?  You didn't.  How you doing?  The Yankees didn't adopt that, though.  I know.  The Mets didn't.  They didn't adopt that?  They played it at every home game.  No, they didn't.  They played it at the stadium.  No, it was Bob Shepard.  Every home game.  That's a pack of lies.  Go ahead, man. 
[02:04:30]  Number five now.  Coming into number five.  Rich Voss?  1982.  When he wrote his first joke.  It's only...  And his last joke.  The dryer door.  Remember the video for this, Opie?  During the early days of MTV.  Tony Vassel and Mickey.  Remember the little cheerleaders in the big fat bruiser one?  That you'd always look at and go, why is she there?  For the bottom of the pyramid.  Remember her big tree trunk legs?  She was old back then, you know.  Oh, Mickey, what a pity you don't understand. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, remember her?  Mm-hmm.  Sure.  Mike wants to know if Dale Earnhardt's on the list.  Ouch.  His one hit.  Turn three.  David Cassidy, I guess.  I know number one.  I figured it out.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  All right.  Number four.  Remember this one?  Right said Fred.  I'm too sexy.  Oh, yeah.  I'm too sexy for my shirt.  My shirt.  Too sexy for my shirt.  Too sexy, my part. 
[02:05:30]  No, too sexy.  It hurts.  It hurts.  On the catwalk, I shake my little tush on the catwalk.  Wasn't that...  Dude, it's still Benny King.  Faggot.  Ben, you stink.  That gets all excited, and I keep going.  Oh, here it is.  All my love, love's going to leave me.  I'm a homo for my ass.  A homo for my ass. 
[02:06:00]  Did you hear the Mabel King version?  I'm too sexy for these legs.  That's two in one day.  Nancy Reagan, I'm too sexy for my breasts.  There it is.  Sexy for my shirt.  So sexy, it hurts.  Faggot.  Sexy for my land.  You can't touch. 
[02:06:30]  Got ourselves a pretty little faggot.  Just muscle man A-sex.  That's all you're thinking when you hear this.  Susan Smith, I'm too sexy for these kids.  Blub, blub, blub, blub.  Wow, you're horrible.  Yeah, it's number four, I'll be right, said friend. 
[02:07:00]  I'm too sexy.  All the way back in 1992.  All right.  You are so bad.  Number three.  I'm thinking more.  Dexy's Midnight Runners.  Remember?  Come on, Eileen.  Yes.  Oh, I swear.  1983, that was.  Hmm.  Dressed in dungarees, mingled genres like rock and Celtic soul. 
[02:07:30]  Knocked Michael Jackson's Billie Jean off the number one spot in 1983.  Ooh.  Number two.  Tainted Love, Soft Cell.  Tainted Love.  Eh, eh.  Eh, eh.  Remember that?  Oh, yeah.  And, of course, number one.  Wait, they had a version of Where Did Our Love Go?  That was a part of it, though.  Well, not a version of Where Did Our Love Go?  And then they added it on to the end of the song, then. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  Number one.  Come on.  The most overplayed piece of crap.  Hey, Macarena.  Right.  1996.  The Macarena.  Hey, Macarena.  You couldn't go anywhere.  If there was a gang rape going on, they would stop at some point and all do the Macarena.  It didn't matter where you were or what you were doing.  Same people that did the electric slide did the Macarena. 
[02:08:30]  What?  The same type of person.  Oh, oh, yeah.  Well.  That would do that.  Because it ended up at every wedding, every function.  Get up.  Come on, everybody now.  Hit the dance floor.  It's time to do the Macarena.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, Macarena.  Mike wants to know if this was on the list, Anthony.  Yes, Mike?  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  Is Nancy Reagan on the list or is that one tit wonder?  Hey, guys.  Quick what I learned.  Hold on.  They jumped out. 
[02:09:00]  Hey, I don't think they'll let that.  Quick what I learned.  Wait, wait, wait.  Nancy Reagan was not on the list.  And you can't say the word that rhymes with hit.  The one tit wonder.  Yeah, she's the one tit wonder.  Hey, quick what I learned.  Yeah.  Anthony still has hope for Meredith Brooks' career.  Faggot.  Still have hope.  I don't have hope.  Norton, you rule.  Thank you, fella.  Thank you, Mike.  Let's go to Lewis Black.  Very upset.  Yes, Lewis.  Lewis.  Lewis.  Are you there, Lewis Black?  Lewis Black, come in.  Lewis.  He left.  Lewis.  Angel feet. 
[02:09:30]  Lewis.  He's gone.  Some of the other things quickly.  Kung fu fighting.  Carl Douglas.  Is that any relation, Earl?  No.  That was number 100.  Just squeezing in.  Blind melons in there with no rain.  Yeah, that was pretty much good.  They didn't have anything else?  No, it's kind of hard to write hits when you're overdosing.  Yeah.  I want candy, bow-wow-wow.  How about Wang Chung, Anthony?  Everybody Wang Chung tonight?  Remember that chicken, bow-wow-wow?  Oh, yeah.  Hot.  I want candy.  Jesus. 
[02:10:00]  Just a friend, Bismarcky.  He's in there.  Yo.  Wow.  You say you're not a friend.  Oh, baby, yo.  Even I could sing that one.  Taco putting on the reds.  Oh, wow, yeah.  Remember that?  Come on, feel the noise.  How bizarre.  She's a maniac.  Michael, uh...  Some Beckos.  Epic.  Mambo No. 5.  Yeah.  Kenny Loggins in there at all?  Footloose? 
[02:10:30]  Kenny Loggins.  Kenny Loggins had a bunch of hits.  I don't know.  How do I know?  It looks like Ted Kaczynski.  It's in Danger Zone.  Oh, I didn't think that was a hit.  8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9.  That was in there.  That poor guy still sings that stupid song.  Oh, I know.  And then they show him now singing the song.  Now he does an acoustic version just to mix it up a little bit.  It's like, dude, move on.  Who can forget 1977's Making It?  I'm making it.  With David Naughton, who was in American Werewolf in London and the Dr. Pepper commercials. 
[02:11:00]  And the Making It TV show.  I Touch Myself, the Divinals.  Sure.  She was so hot.  She had the big, big ones.  Falco.  Rock me, I'm a tail.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Frankie goes to Hollywood, Rick.  How about Dirk?  How about Dirk?  How about Dirk?  Uh-oh.  Dirk, comma, saws in tower.  Uh-oh.  Starland Vocal Band.  Ja, ja.  Ja, ja.  Don't turn around.  Uh-oh.  Ja, ja.  Chumba Wumba.  How about Chilliwack? 
[02:11:30]  Chilliwack.  She's been gone, gone, gone.  She's been gone so long.  She's been gone, gone, gone.  Susie Quatro, stumbling in.  Remember Susie Quatro?  I'm sure she was a pinky, leather Tuscadero.  Wait, what song is she singing?  Uh, stumbling in.  Foolishly laying the cards on the table.  Stumbling in.  With that English bloke.  Wouldn't she do this?  Happy days.  No, wouldn't she do that?  No, she would slap the legs.  She would slap the legs.  She did some slap thing and then shooting thing.  She did that with the font because that was cool.  That just doesn't hold up. 
[02:12:00]  Play that funky music.  White boy.  How about Adam Ant?  Gary Neumann, Cars.  32 shoes.  Big country.  In a big country.  Feeling hot, hot, hot.  Buster Poindexter.  Oh, poor Buster.  It was a lot of fun to watch, of course, over this weekend.  Dude, you know what?  Uh, hmm.  What?  Uh, hmm.  What?  Uh, hmm.  What?  I'm trying to think if I want to be in the barrel today or not. 
[02:12:30]  What?  Guilty pleasure.  Buster Poindexter, the hot, hot, hot.  Hot, hot, hot.  When I was, uh, working in Rochester.  Back in 1987, Opie?  I, uh.  I'll rub clear stuff on you.  I, uh.  I'm not saying that.  Say it.  You committed.  Did you do a hot, hot, hot promotion?  I, uh, did some, uh, some modeling.  Okay.  Wait a minute.  I don't even know about this.  I've never heard about this. 
[02:13:00]  I've never heard about this.  Modeling.  There was a time I was doing a lot of TV work, Anthony, and, uh, there's a tape that might  be floating around.  That has me, uh, kind of.  With the gay men's health crisis.  Dancing on the beach.  No, no, stop it.  One of the many beaches of Rochester.  Stop it.  With very hot chicks in, uh, swimwear.  All right, so the girls are in swimwear.  What are you dressed in?  I really, it's been so long. 
[02:13:30]  You gotta know what you were dressed in.  Come on, give me a little more of an image here.  Give me a little more image.  I forgot what the commercial was for.  It ran all over Rochester TV for months.  I have one thing to say.  Okay.  So you're, you're walking down the beach.  It's been so long, I, I really don't remember the premise.  What was the, what was the ad for?  I don't know.  I thought it was for swimwear or something.  Did you have to dance, though?  Yeah, we kind of did.  Oh! 
[02:14:00]  Did a, oh!  Oh!  No.  I could bring that in as, uh, my embarrassing moment.  Feeling hot, hot, hot.  That was the song in the background.  And that was playing, you were dancing to it?  Did you have a drink in your hand or something?  Woo!  A little umbrella in it?  Did you do a conga line with the girls?  You know who knows is Buzzy.  Yeah?  Buzzy has a tape of that.  He'll hang out to dry.  Uh, I'm trying to, I, I could probably call him.  You want me to call him?  Yeah, yeah, I gotta know what that's all about.  If someone gets my cell phone, I can call, uh, Buzzy. 
[02:14:30]  I'll put myself in the barrel.  I can't, I can't remember the promotion.  No, uh, rock and roll McDonald's didn't make none.  Rock and roll McDonald's!  Rock and roll McDonald's!  Rock and roll McDonald's!  We'll play that going into break here.  And, uh, 31, uh, Opie, number 31, 1983.  83?  I don't think it was that long ago.  I don't think I mean 93.  Unbelievable, EMF?  Yeah.  With dice in there. 
[02:15:00]  Unbelievable.  Oh!  Oh!  Unbelievable!  It's, the mark here is 1983.  Anthony, I got, I got number 50 on the list.  Alright.  Smack dab in the middle.  50.  Number 50.  Okay.  We deliver keggers!  Wow, one hit wonder.  We deliver keggers!  Yep.  We deliver keggers!  Kegger!  Eh!  Yeah, uh, call that number right now.  More, more, more!  Please.  How do you like it?  How do you like, number 60. 
[02:15:30]  That was a great show, though.  Some of the guys died of AIDS, and bad livers, and kidneys.  The ninja claimed quite a few.  All sorts of crazy stuff.  The virus.  The big V.  The high five.  No, they didn't dump out of the one, uh, blank wonder.  Thank you.  Thank you.  What do you got there?  The knack.  Were they on there?  The knack was on the list?  For my Sharona?  My, my, my, my.  They had a hit, didn't they?  Woo!  Let me see that stupid album. 
[02:16:00]  That was a true hit.  That song became a hit again.  Shouldn't have ever been a hit.  It was brutal.  What about the Flock of Seagulls, Anthony?  Did I make the list?  I ran.  I didn't see them.  I'm sure they're on here somewhere.  I can't look at them all.  Do you know, uh, number 56 was, uh, Loving You by Minnie Riperton?  Remember that one?  Loving you!  It's easy cause you be...  You know who Minnie Riperton's mother is?  Uh, no.  Uh, uh, no.  You have no idea?  No clue.  Uh, I wish I could remember the name. 
[02:16:30]  You know the chick.  She's on SNL.  That's her daughter.  Yeah, it's her daughter.  Oh, oh, oh, okay.  Yeah.  Rudolph.  Rudolph, uh...  Didn't she die like...  Didn't she die?  Uh, Minnie Riperton, dead.  The big C.  The big casino.  No.  Not long after she did the hit?  Really?  I believe so.  How about that?  She was in, uh, the audience for one of Richard Pryor's, uh, greatest, uh, uh, CDs.  She was there for Bicentennial Nigger.  She was there when that was being taken.  And she, what?  Did he point her out?  He introduces her, yes.  I like the other one where he points out, uh, what's his name? 
[02:17:00]  Huey Newton.  Huey Lewis.  Uh, yeah.  Oh, Huey Lewis.  Yeah, Huey Lewis.  Huey Lewis.  Yeah, it was live.  It's hip to B-squared.  Sean, what's up?  Huey Lewis.  Hey.  So, uh, did you guys see how much, uh, the B-52's chick is blown up?  Oh, the redhead?  Yeah, the redhead.  Yeah.  I mean, she just looks so large in that special.  It's so funny to see, like, not just the one hit wonders, but, I mean, her especially.  They didn't even have her standing up.  They had her sitting down in a chair. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, she was all buxom back in the day.  Yeah, not anymore.  And, uh, also, you know, Vanilla Ice sold the, uh, song, uh, How's It Go?  Come on, help me out.  Uh, Play a Funky Music, White Boy.  That was on the list of the original.  And that guy ended up making a lot of money, not on the hit, but when Vanilla Ice used it  later on and didn't credit him in the, uh, credit.  How about that?  How about that?  Look at that.  All right, Sean, thank you.  Yep, you suck.  Bye.  There's an oasis of trivia. 
[02:18:00]  Yes, he is.  Yeah, we did our version of Hey Macarena, which was a big hit for many radio stations across  America.  Hey Macarena!  All the radio stations were playing it and making believe it was their own.  But for some reason, we can't play it on our show anymore because the M word is not allowed.  Oh, Christ on a pony!  That is insane.  I never even thought about that.  Even though other shows still use the M word for self-pleasuring, we're not allowed to.  Yeah.  So we can't play our version of Hey Macarena.  Is that the FCC?  Uh, I don't know.  No, it's just, it's the rules down the, down the hall there. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, it's not even a, a government rule.  It's some rule that's been enacted for this show.  It was the first thing, and I did that went national.  All the, all the radio stations picked it up and were playing it like crazy.  Are they still allowed to play it?  I, I don't, I, it's, it's dated now.  Yeah, it's ridiculous.  It was, it was huge when, you know, Hey Macarena was popular.  It was a little goof, a little parody on that.  I, you know what was the worst part of it?  The Macarena was watching people's smiles when they did it at a wedding.  Like they were all just having such a ball being out there.  You know, kind of letting their hair down. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, ha, ha.  Didn't you hope just someone burst in with a machine gun?  Believe me.  Or the floor collapsed.  Israeli dance hall.  If they were doing the Macarena, nothing could make me happier.  Uh, Anthony?  Yeah.  I was delaying, but I can't get, uh, Buzzy on the line.  You can't get him?  But you don't remember what the, uh, thing was horror.  And unfortunately we're not, we're not live in Rochester, so Buzzy will hear us talking  about him at like two in the morning or something.  It stinks.  So maybe he'll call tomorrow if he hears this and, uh, if you can find out about that.  You can tell everyone about this, uh, this, uh, modeling thing. 
[02:19:30]  Modeling?  Ugh.  They may edit that out, though.  Don't they edit the show?  That's always good.  You know, why would you want to hear all four hours?  Uh, Rochester decides what, uh, parts of the show they want to put on.  Really?  You uptight white creeps?  And then they tell me that that's not going on.  And then, you know, I got fraternity brothers and friends taping the show, giving me tapes  where it proves they are doing that, but they tell me they're not.  Why are you lying, you little worms?  So, sometimes they, uh, they break from the show and just don't come back.  Yeah, why would you?  Like, ah, they heard enough of the old show today and they go back to music. 
[02:20:00]  That's it.  Music, I play some music, guys.  That's a complete mess up there.  That's Slick in charge up there.  There you go.  We're still trying to figure out what to do with that situation.  Our buddy Slick.  Get out of the pool, Slick.  All right, Ann, why don't we take a break?  I just don't like liars, you know?  Liar, liar.  If we call you and say, hey, we know this is going on, we'll admit it and say why you're  doing it instead of make believe it's not because you're assuming that we're so far away  that we'll never catch you.  Yeah.  No one cares about that town anyway.  It's awful.  Yeah, I said it. 
[02:20:30]  It's awful.  Jim doesn't like Rochester.  No, how can you?  Why don't you like Rochester because they're messing up with the radio, messing the radio  show?  That's exactly why I don't like it.  It's one guy.  I don't care.  One guy that controls what happens.  He's too sexy for the O&A show.  Too sexy for the O&A show.  You're just pissed because no one's buying your tickets in Rochester.  Nothing to do with it at all.  One guy is messing up Iraq, too, but we seem to hate the whole country.  I don't like Rochester because of that guy.  Wow, let's invade.  Some of the people in Iraq are endearing. 
[02:21:00]  Exactly, and too bad they're going down with him.  They enjoy our American ways.  And they get to watch American TV and stuff.  On the down low.  What?  Go ahead.  No, I'm just reading instant feedbacks, and a couple are very funny, but it's something  we did, like, a few minutes ago about the I'm Too Sexy, or, uh, what's his name from?  I'm Too Sexy again.  Rock Hudson, I'm too sexy for my T-cells. 
[02:21:30]  Too sexy for my T-cells.  Very funny.  That's a bob.  There's something else there.  There's so many you could do if we only had time.  All right.  Ronald Reagan, I'm too sexy for this colon.  JFK, I'm too sexy for these brains. 
[02:22:00]  Too sexy.  Wow.  Oh, Grace.  There you go.  The Ramseys, we're too sexy for these little dresses.  Oh, no.  Yeah, that is true.  I was listening to Brother Weez this Sunday, and he did play our Macarena parody song. 
[02:22:30]  On this station, it was heard.  On this station, yeah.  And we, the people that, uh, you know, wrote it and performed it, Anthony, did the whole  damn thing there.  Oh, we can't play it on our own show.  We can't, uh, play it.  Right.  How is that, how does that work?  It's on the same station.  Because Weez was talking about us and the Hey Macarena and stuff, and then they played our  song.  And they were chuckling along with it.  I forgot about that.  I heard it on the way home from Philly Sunday.  All right.  There you go.  All right, Terrence, thanks for reminding me of that, even though you didn't talk in the 
[02:23:00]  radio.  Well, yeah, dude, you didn't call me.  What?  You didn't call my name.  Turkish.  Yeah.  All right, later.  Wait, Turkish.  No, I saw what you were going to say, and I just beat you the punch, and I'm just thanking  you for reminding me.  People get upset when you do that.  Yeah.  That's why I said Turkish.  When you talk about what they wanted to talk about, to make it brief.  I gave them the credit there.  Sometimes, you know, you come up with something, and we read it, and we can briefly get to  it.  You don't have to go on with a long-winded story, but then they get upset.  It happens on instant feedback.  Sometimes it's like, oh, yeah, okay, that's a good point. 
[02:23:30]  We should bring up.  And I read it, or I talk about it without reading it verbatim, and then I get yelled  at.  Oh, thanks for using my idea.  It's like, no.  Look, man.  Jack Toole.  We give our listeners more credit than any other radio show.  And sometimes we do just blatantly steal it.  No, not really.  When you're trying to do a quick, witty radio show.  Right.  You've got to go with the flow.  Anthony Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Wesley Willis.  Rock and Roll McDonald's. 
[02:24:00]  He did not make the one-hit wonder show on VH1.  No, but he should.  No, because he has many hits.  Oh, maybe that's it.  Right.  Okay.  He has a lot of hits.  McDonald's is a place to rock.  It is a restaurant where they buy food to eat.  It is a good place to listen to the music.  People flock here to get down to the rock music.

[02:26:30]  1027-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00.  Here, checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, man.  We might have a problem in Seattle.  Still, what's going on?  Hey, Opie and Anthony.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey, I was just wondering.  I'm trying to figure out if I'm getting screwed here in Seattle or not with the show.  Because, like, I called up.  Like, right now, they were just playing an old bit with Tom at the getting some beer.  They're calling that old lady ugly there. 
[02:27:00]  They played it for, like, 25 minutes.  We're not live in Seattle today?  Not yet.  But they're playing old stuff?  Yes, exactly.  Okay, that's good.  And you know what?  No, that just means they're having satellite problems.  Oh, is that all?  Woo!  Oh, okay.  We don't want to lose our Seattle audience.  All 10 of you.  Yeah, you can.  Yeah, really?  Yeah, you know what?  Because I noticed it on Thursday.  They didn't play, like, the first hour of the live from Philly.  Oh, boy.  That pissed me off because I missed the, you know, hook gear and everything.  You missed some great stuff from Philly.  Well, I had to go to Syndication Underground. 
[02:27:30]  All right, Stu.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  See you, Petunia.  Later.  Ah, Dennis, what's going on?  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I saw a new job to get to a short story.  Did you guys talk about Dionne Wormack and busted?  Dionne Wormack.  Who's Dionne Wormack, sir?  Pardon?  Who's Dionne Wormack?  Wormack, she, uh, is there some black singer that got busted out in Miami?  I don't know, but who's Dionne Wormack?  Dionne Wormack.  He's a crooked cop.  He got mixed up in the rackets and got what was coming to him. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, Miss Wormack?  Yes.  Yeah, Miss Wormack.  Wormack.  Busted for pot.  Right.  Something like that.  Didn't certain other psychic friends told her about that or something?  Oh, what?  Oh, I...  She was looking at one anyway.  We got stuck.  I wonder how many radio shows used that line.  Oh, my God.  She should have said that's coming.  I think I would have told her. 
[02:28:30]  Eddie Trunk has a story about Stalker Patty.  Stalker Patty, yeah.  We pretty much got Stalker Patty kicked out of her $100 a month pad.  Assuming that she would move on to better digs.  Right.  It's like an intervention with us.  We had to force her out of that place.  And I guess she has not found better digs.  Digs, digs, digs.  So, she's been sleeping at the radio station?  Trunk?  Eddie?  Yeah, dude.  She was dropped in my lap like a hot potato Saturday night. 
[02:29:00]  I had no idea what the hell was going on.  You should have handed her off to Piazza.  Well, he actually walked in and saw her sleeping under the stairs in the common area there.  And it was like just a whole bizarre scene.  But I had no idea.  Hey, Eddie, good job keeping Mike Piazza up late on Saturday.  They did a great job on Sunday.  I know.  What are you doing to me, Eddie?  What are you doing to the Mets, Eddie?  You're ruining it.  Eddie, good friends with Mike Piazza.  And Mike decides to do Eddie Trunk's show every Saturday night with him.  And then the guy's sitting there the next day. 
[02:29:30]  No, not every Saturday night.  It was the first time he came in in a few months this past Saturday.  So, Stalker Patty's sleeping under the stairs?  Yeah, well, what happened is I walked in from outside about a quarter to ten getting ready to do my show.  And as I come into the security area, she's there with a duffel bag and a teddy bear.  And I'm like, what's going on?  And she goes, well, I'm here for you to let me up so I can go to sleep.  And I said, what?  And she said, well, I'm coming to sleep in the blue room. 
[02:30:00]  Or the green room, or whatever she called it.  Yeah.  And I said, well, Patty, it's kind of difficult because, you know, I do a heavy metal show.  It's a little loud.  And I have two people working the phones.  And I have guests coming in that need to sit there before they go on.  I said, it's kind of difficult.  They said, yeah, I felt bad for her.  But I only knew bits and pieces of the story.  And she's like, well, I've got to tell you about what happened.  Oh, another long-winded story from Patty. 
[02:30:30]  Where is she today?  Anyone know?  I heard that she was sleeping here pretty much ever since we left on Wednesday to hit the road.  Well, dude, I didn't know what to do because I didn't know, like, you know, to let her up.  And then she couldn't come in that area.  So then I said to the intern that works with me, there's that sofa under the stairs when you first walk in.  And I said, well, I guess just clear off the Snapple or whatever out there and let her sleep on that sofa.  Tell me someone has a picture of Starker Patty sleeping under our stairs.  Is there a picture?  You know, I don't think, I don't know if anybody took a picture. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, we need a picture of that.  But she had a really, it was so depressing because she had a really beat-up, dirty teddy bear.  Nice.  And when Mike showed up.  Hold on, hold on.  We got some, another witness in the studio.  Yep.  Hey, Eddie.  It's Marissa.  Oh, yeah, Marissa was there for the whole thing.  The hot Marissa, who used to intern for us.  Look how much she's maturing.  Wow, look at you.  Growing into a lovely young woman.  She's all of 17 now. 
[02:31:30]  No, I'm just kidding.  You're 17?  No, 21.  Wow.  She's completely legit now.  17 or 18 with us.  Yeah.  Anyway, go ahead.  Yeah, she slept with a big stuffed rabbit.  And there's something wrong with her foot and stuff.  Oh, yeah, she's got that foot thing.  She was almost in tears.  I felt so depressed.  Oh, hey.  She's just thrown around.  More info coming in at YV from Queens.  I heard Scott Farrell, who does mornings here in New York for us, talking about some stinking  dirty woman sleeping at N.E.W.  What is it?  The flop house.  Another stinking dirty woman in the lobby. 
[02:32:00]  Farrell busted in on me on Friday night.  And I don't think she was there on Friday, though.  I only got this on Saturday.  And then the worst part, the thing that made me feel the worst about the whole thing was  that she's sleeping out there.  It's all bright.  And I'm walking in and out.  And I see her, like, finally doze off.  And then Piazza actually calls me and says, hey, I'm going to stop by for a little bit.  So I go to let him in that side door.  And Patty's sound asleep.  So I'm figuring, well, you know, leave her be, you know, whatever.  So we walk in. 
[02:32:30]  And then as Mike leaves, like 45 minutes later, he goes out the door.  And as I walk back in, I see a little notebook on the top of the reception desk, this frayed-up  notebook with a handwritten post-it from Patty saying, would you mind having Mike Piazza  sign my autograph book to cure my depression?  So she's begging for autographs as she's squatting in our studios.  We have a squatter here in our studios.  Patty has decided she's going to take up residence here.  But Ann, I suspect she was faking sleep the whole time because her eyes were shut. 
[02:33:00]  I don't know when she did this.  Marissa, when did she leave?  I don't know.  She left by the time I came in on Sunday night.  And then she came back Sunday night to sleep.  So she's going out?  She's coming in and out.  And going about her business.  I told her, why doesn't she work at McDonald's anymore?  She's like, oh, I only work one day out of the week.  I work one day a week because of Mike Foot and I need a place to live.  She's sleeping under the stairs.  Yep.  I'm the creature under the stairs like a troll. 
[02:33:30]  I told her to Patty about the autograph book.  I told her, don't feel bad.  Actually, I told her about it.  You're like little Harry Potter.  I was going to say, stalker Potter.  Stalker Potter.  But she said you guys stuck up for her, that she was really indebted to you guys.  And dad, and we got her thrown out of her place.  And I couldn't be happier.  Oh, my God.  She kept telling me that Rory from the Ron and Fez show told her that it was okay to come  sleep at the station anytime.  Rory, the owner of NEW?  Right.  Oh, okay.  So I called Rory and I asked him, I was like, hey, Rory, you know, I don't want this to 
[02:34:00]  be my ass if this isn't cool.  Did you tell her this?  And he's like, well, not really, dude, but two days ago she stayed at my girlfriend's  house.  She's sleeping under the stairs.  Oh, my good gosh.  All right.  I need a place.  Hey, Eddie, did Piazza sign for her?  Well, no, because we didn't see the book until after he left.  All I wanted to know.  Good.  You should have signed it, Eddie.  Yeah, you should have signed it.  Kill yourself and then just forge his name.  Well, I said that when she kind of woke up, I said, Patty, I didn't see the book until 
[02:34:30]  after Mike left and I walked back in.  We didn't see it.  And she's like, that's okay.  Something for next time.  Did Piazza throw her a dollar and tell her how much she could get on 1010220 with that  buck?  A buck don't get you much these days, Mike.  All right, hold on.  Stalker Patty's checking in.  Ah, good.  Thank God.  Yeah.  Stalker Patty.  Hi, how are you?  How are you?  I have to make this very brief.  Why?  Why?  Well, I'm in a women's shelter and I checked myself in to stay here a few days so I can 
[02:35:00]  continue to look for lodging.  Lodging?  Yep.  And I already saw somebody from public assistance this morning and I have an activated card and  I'll get food stamps and everything.  So anyway, that's basically what's happening with me.  Hey, wait a minute.  You're living at a shelter now?  Yes, in Brooklyn.  It was the only resort that I had.  Well, resort is probably the wrong word. 
[02:35:30]  Very funny.  How is it, Patty?  How is the place?  It's going to be very rough, okay?  Why?  I'm not used to this sort of arrangement.  Well, there's a lot of tough women in there, right?  With serious problems.  Are you going to join a gang?  Yeah, have they beat you in yet?  No.  Are you going to tattoo the gimps?  How was sleeping under the stairs?  It was fine.  They were very good to let me do that.  It's very nice of them.  And James is saying she's like Spot in the Munsters. 
[02:36:00]  Where, Patty?  Patty?  Patty?  Where's Patty, Lily?  You can't stay there, Patty.  I won't let you.  I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't.  Now you can stay upstairs with Eddie.  Patty.  Yes?  What's the scene there at the shelter?  Take me a picture.  Well, they took my picture.  They finger imaged me.  I get my bed at 10 o'clock.  I'm just going to wait.  Now, now, wait a minute.  Your bed, do you have your own room? 
[02:36:30]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Back up.  No, I don't have my own room.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Back up.  Yes?  Whose finger imaging you?  One of the workers here.  They printed you?  Yes.  And then they take your picture?  Yes.  And they give you a bed in a big barracks type thing?  Sort of.  I don't know.  There's like three, four people to a room.  Three or four people.  Are they all black?  No.  All next.  Yeah.  And has anybody given you any lip yet?  No, not at all.  No, I did.  I had to come into the office to use a phone because when I went to the toupee phones, they 
[02:37:00]  were like, people were like on it and they could be on those phones a long time.  So there's only two phones in the same place.  Da, da, da, da.  Hey, Patty, make sure you duct tape up your areas.  Yeah, duct tape yourself, Patty.  No, serious.  I know.  You know how they are there?  Yeah.  They do things when you're sleeping.  The employees will ravage you or some of the inmates over there.  Well, I'll watch myself.  You ever see caged heat?  You ever see caged heat? 
[02:37:30]  No.  Yeah, the girl got it with a broom handle.  Oh, I hope that doesn't happen to me.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Blind Dave wants in.  Blind Dave, what's up?  How's it going, guys?  All right.  Hey, listen.  I've been on your show a bunch of times, right?  Yeah.  Have I ever told you, I'm blind and I'm broke and I don't have a place to stay?  No.  You don't really like star capacity, do you, Blind Dave?  I just, I've been breaking my ass trying to find a job and there's people out there that  can work unless she's a complete retard. 
[02:38:00]  Well.  And I'm not without a place to live.  I'm living on Social Security.  I'm not on welfare and I don't get food stamps and I can't even see to do my work anymore.  Patty, why?  It pisses me off.  Why aren't you working so you can afford a place to live like a normal human being?  Well, because my job is sales and you have to stand on your feet six hours a day or more  and I can't do that.  So why didn't you understand, Patty?  Well, Dave is blind, man.  Dave is blind. 
[02:38:30]  He doesn't have any time for this crap.  Patty.  Yes?  Get it over with.  Didn't you understand that if you had your foot repaired that you were going to be out  of work and you didn't know what you were going to do?  Well, now I was too much of a retard to figure it out.  No, that's not what it's about.  Now, they are letting me work.  Get over yourself.  Poor me.  I don't have rent.  I'm going to be kicked out of my place.  Oh, that wasn't the reason why I was kicked out.  You said that repeatedly.  How many places?  She got kicked out and then couldn't even be in the car. 
[02:39:00]  I'm broke.  I'm broke and I'm blind.  I get Social Security.  You know why?  Because I worked and paid into it.  Oh, okay.  Maybe you got it.  Like you, you're just sitting there sucking friggin' welfare.  Well, no.  Food stamp.  No, not exactly.  Just to help me out now until I find a place.  You're a loser.  Patty, when do you think you're going to be able to find a place?  I don't know.  I'm going to work with a caseworker tomorrow. 
[02:39:30]  And what, are they going to decide how much money you're going to be able to dole out from  the taxpayers of this great city?  Well, I'm not...  The taxpayers can pay for her to sit on her ass.  Well, no.  Don't get me wrong.  You know.  We're running out of time.  Are you still going to work, Patty?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Adam Pilara, Saturday, killed.  Oh, cool.  Well, you can't see him.  You didn't see him.  You heard him.  You heard him.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, I was there.  All right.  Hey, Patty, how long did you stay there on Sunday?  Did you stay there right through the next night? 
[02:40:00]  Right.  No, I just stayed overnight Sunday and left and came back again 9.30 at night.  All right.  I had to get my stuff into storage.  All right.  Listen, listen.  Oh, God.  All right.  Listen, this is an ongoing thing.  We'll talk to Patty tomorrow.  Eddie, thanks for calling in.  All right, guys.  Bye, Ed.  Patty.  Patty.  Yes.  I'll talk to you tomorrow.  Sweet dreams, Patty.  Oh, thank you.  Have a good night.  Okay.  Oh, hey, Patty, you know who you can call?  Who? 
[02:40:30]  Janet.  That's horrible.  You.  You guys are stuck in it.  You should help her.  Shut up, you twat.  You make fun of her all the time.  Eat me.  The only reason why it's entertaining is because you're not total a-holes about it.  You know what, Janet?  I have to agree with you on this one.  You're being vicious and nasty.  You know, she's obviously mentally impaired.  Retard is the word you're looking for.  She's retarded.  Yes.  And you know what?  It's not funny when you really screw with the retarded and they're homeless.  It's hysterical.  It's not hysterical. 
[02:41:00]  It's terrible.  And it's funnier when you help her and then you make fun of her.  I'm not saying it's not funny.  I'm just saying it's awful.  Well, we're dishing out another 906 bucks to her during our softball game.  You can't leave her homeless, though.  That's horrendous.  No, it's disgusting.  She's sleeping under the stairs.  It's vicious and horrible.  You're all going to hell fast.  It's a little joke.  You're on the express bus. 
[02:41:30]  It's a little joke.  All right.  Bye, Janet.  Goodbye.  We'll play What Do We Learn Next.  All right.  Next.  What did you learn today?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027-WNAW.  Man, we're running out of show.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Jim Norton in the studio.  My old college friend, Buzzy, on the line.  Oh, maybe we can get to the bottom of the modeling thing.  Buzzy!  Oh, sir. 
[02:42:00]  What's going on, bro?  Dude, I'm just sitting here in this bar in Honey, I found out.  I've been sitting here since St. Patrick's Day waiting to hear from you.  Oh, I forgot to call you back.  What is up, brah?  Well, we've got to save this for tomorrow because we're running out of time.  Do you remember when I did some, quote, modeling in Rochester?  Yes, I do.  And that hot, hot, hot song was playing in the background?  Not only that, but I have it on tape.  I've been holding out for the highest bidder.  Anthony, what do I hear? 
[02:42:30]  50, 100, 200 bucks?  Listen, Buzz, we literally have two minutes left in the show, and this is too good.  You've got to call us tomorrow and give Anthony all the details, okay?  It's a deal.  And maybe even find the tape and play it in the background.  You know what?  You're giving me something to look for tonight.  All right, cool.  Buzz, find that tape, and I swear, if there's any way, you can get it to me immediately.  That would be too funny.  I will definitely pay you money, hundreds.  They're hot.  They're here.  TV 8Ds.  Hot, hot, hot. 
[02:43:00]  I'll call you guys tomorrow.  There's Opie dancing.  Oh, my God.  I was bottling T-shirts.  That's right.  It's in his mouth.  It's a, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, crap.  I'm done tomorrow.  I'm done.  See, Opie jerking.  I am so done tomorrow.  Sponge, sponge, sponge.  That was Buffalo.  Shut up.  What was it for?  T-shirts?  Is that what the commercials were for?  All right.  For a TV station.  Wait, TV station T-shirts? 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, I just remember now.  And they met girls around?  Yeah.  What, did they do a fast motion Benny Hill type scene?  Those are always funny.  Never.  Doing a lot of these jumps?  Joe from Lowell.  Jump up and click your heels together.  All right, stop.  You can get me tomorrow.  Joe from Lowell.  Today I learned that someone wants Stalker Patty's panties.  Jersey Gary, I learned it's tough to write hits while you're overdosing.  I'll say.  He also learned low bridges keep the shwoogies off the beaches.  He learned Dan from Hoboken got scolded for once.  Ha, ha. 
[02:44:00]  And he also learned we're all just viruses here on Earth.  Uh-huh.  Sheep lover.  I learned today snoring always funny.  He also learned the elephant man wore that hat because he had to look sporty.  Sheep lover.  Also learned cars weigh 400 pounds, Anthony.  Light.  Stones fan from New Hampshire.  New Hampshire.  If you're going to shoot a mass murderer, make sure there are bullets in the gun.  Mm-hmm.  And Dan from Hoboken.  You would think that you are homeless bald and get tooled on by a blind guy.  It should probably take more than a Mike Piazza autograph to cure your depression. 
[02:44:30]  And I learned never to stand in Anthony's lane chatting when he's trying to get home.  Right.  I'll hit you.  We ran out of show, unfortunately.  There you go.  Let's go to Samantha.  Samantha, what did you learn?  I learned that pickle punks are going to be on the Antique Roadshow.  They are antiques indeed.  Very nice.  Bye.  All right.  Bye.  That's it for today.  We got lots to do tomorrow.  Yeah.  We'll start with Budsy hopefully tomorrow.  All right.  I can't wait.  I want the details on that.  What thing? 
[02:45:00]  Getting nervous?  Hey, we're all supposed to bring in our embarrassing moments on tape.  Oh, that's true.  Okay.  But you know what it is?  That's mine.  I noticed that no one's really bringing it in.  Someone has to commit.  Hold the phone, Pally.  That isn't really audio embarrassing.  It's a video.  We'll put it on Foundry Music.  Dude, I think a lot more people are affected by what's played over the airway.  Is it audio?  Are you speaking in it?  Trust me.  When you see the...  I don't think so.  When you see this video, trust me. 
[02:45:30]  It doesn't get any worse than that.  All right.  Then I'm bringing a video.  That's fine.  Okay.  And you're going to bring a video of one of your first performances on stage, Jim Norton.  I have one that's from 1993, which I was awful, a little high-energy character,  and one from like six months into the business.  I was awful.  And Rick could bring one of his band things where he's got Ricky Says Relax on his shirt or something.  All right.  Ben's freaking, everyone.  Ben the snorers.  Look at him freaking out.  Little finger.  Can I at least end with Ben snoring real fast over there, somebody? 
[02:46:00]  All right, real quick.  Don't, don't.  We've got to get...  This is Ben snoring.  We'll see you tomorrow.  One, two, three, four, five, five, five, five, five, six, six, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven </pre>
