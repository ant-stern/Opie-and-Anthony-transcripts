<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a Guns N' Roses song and the hosts' characteristically boisterous and profane greeting.  The broadcast heavily featured vulgar language throughout. A significant portion focused on *The Honeymooners*, praising its humor, characters (particularly Alice Kramden's wit and dominance), and cultural impact, while also debating its compatibility with modern feminist perspectives.  They detailed a publicity stunt involving a staffer, Eric ("Sexbagel" or "Hawk"), disrupting a news crew covering a hawk nest, resulting in a hilarious (though embarrassing for Eric) video available on opianthony.com.  This led to promoting an "assault on the media" campaign, encouraging listeners to similarly disrupt news reports, offering prizes like XM satellite radios (including a MiFi device) for submissions. Past stunts, including incidents involving Gumby and gorilla suits, were referenced, with one resulting in the word "cunt" being broadcast on live television.

The show announced Tommy Chong as an upcoming guest, prompting discussion of a potential "Stoner Spelling Bee" segment.  Several celebrities who declined to appear were named, including Tom Cruise and Anthony Michael Hall. A song parody by Anthony, dedicated to Martini Steve (known for his flamboyant clothing), was played.  An upcoming eggnog drinking contest (with a MiFi as the prize and rules prohibiting urination/vomiting) was promoted, along with details of the hosts' frugal travel arrangements and past mishaps. A listener call clarified the eggnog contest rules regarding diaper use. The show concluded with more music, including a Snoop Dogg/Doors mashup.

A subsequent segment began with a discussion of a conflict between wealthy Upper East Side residents and nesting hawks, with the hosts jokingly suggesting violent solutions.  Audio clips from an intern, Danny's, field interviews about the hawks were played, featuring an angry woman verbally attacking him. This sparked discussion among the hosts and callers.  The show then moved to calls from truckers sharing stories of witnessing public sex and masturbation from the highway, leading to more jokes and riffing. A bizarre story about a baby with severe facial deformities was discussed, followed by more phone calls and trucker anecdotes.  Finally, Pedro Martinez's departure from the Boston Red Sox and baseball players generally were briefly discussed, concluding with a Lacey Peterson song parody and a preview of the Stoner Spelling Bee.

Another segment started with a nonsensical discussion about baseball players Sheffield and Giambi. A caller, initially Ken (later corrected to Tim), complained about paying extra for XM commercials.  The hosts discussed their infrequent commercials, using a shopping mall analogy to describe their show's position within the XM lineup. A caller, Chris from Maine, questioned the 6 AM start time.  They discussed Eric's "idiot" performance on Fox News, suggesting "Birdman" as a nickname, and mentioned other videos to be posted on their website, including one of them getting a woman to flash her breasts on the Today Show.  The Lacey Peterson verdict was discussed, including a listener's mention of a disturbingly humorous photoshopped wedding invitation. A lengthy discussion about the death penalty and its application, leading to a digression into Michael Jackson and child molestation allegations, followed. Several listener-submitted songs about the Peterson case (ranging from crude parodies to poorly executed tributes) were played and heavily criticized.  The segment concluded with more listener calls, further Peterson case discussions, off-topic banter, mention of upcoming guests Bernie Goetz and Gary Hoey, comments on reactions to the Michael Jackson allegations, an XM radio commercial, and random conversation.


A further segment mocked Ben, a show staffer, his malfunctioning phone, and his gossiping, using crude language. Upcoming guests Gary Hoey and Tommy Chong were mentioned, along with the possibility of Gene Simmons and Tom Cruise.  Maury Povich's show was heavily mocked, with offensive descriptions of its focus on physical abnormalities and unusual family situations. The "WOW" sticker promotion was discussed. Tommy Chong joined the show, discussing his recent jail time for selling paraphernalia, prison experiences (including cellmates, daily life, and a sweat lodge ceremony), and quitting marijuana. He recounted prison anecdotes and interactions with celebrities like Arnold Schwarzenegger who distanced themselves after his arrest.  The segment concluded with a marijuana-themed song.


The final segment featured Tommy Chong.  The conversation centered on his release from prison, his views on the absurdity of his prosecution, and his upcoming stage show, "Marijuana Logs," described as a spoof on a vagina monologue but with three men discussing marijuana.  He shared humorous anecdotes, including a mistaken advance at a YMCA, and stories from his Cheech & Chong days, including improvisation details and character inspiration. He discussed his relationship with Cheech Marin and their reconciliation.  Methods of marijuana consumption were discussed, prompting listener calls. The hosts and Chong also briefly discussed the Opie and Anthony's FCC controversies.  The segment concluded with a brief discussion about waning smallpox vaccine effectiveness and the government's delayed response.

[00:08:00]  Oh, ah.  How do you know it's Mr. Peterson?  Yeah!  Yeah!  Mr. Peterson?  Well, I think you should be sorry, for Christ's sake.  A family member dies, and you insult me.  What the hell is the matter with you anyway? 
[00:08:30]  Peterson?  Pardon my French, but you're an asshole.  Mr. Peterson?  Asshole!  Hey, welcome to the O.P. and Anthony program.  Oh, brother.  Good morning, everybody!  Hello.  We got a busy day, huh? 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, das ja.  Das ja!  Das good!  Can I tell you how stupid I am?  Huh?  Until he did the boat noise, I didn't make the connection, the tie-in with Scott Peterson and  Peterson from Ferris Bueller.  You've been obsessed with it.  I'm just thinking, oh, that's pretty cool.  They yanked out that obscure movie stuff.  Peterson?  Until you did that, I didn't catch it.  Our staff is brilliant.  That is great.  Mr. Peterson?  Mr. Peterson?  I like this one. 
[00:09:30]  Where is it here?  Oh, you know, it's Mr. Peterson.  Mr. Peterson.  Mr. Peterson.  What a great movie that is.  Goddamn, love the Ferris Bueller.  Would you get me Mr. Peterson's daytime number?  Pardon my French, but you're an asshole.  Just warming up, kids.  I love it.  We've got to say hi to everyone that turned on their XM Satellite radios overnight.  Oh.  Saw the numbers.  Oh, my God.  People are starting to flock to this radio program.  Yes. 
[00:10:00]  And the free play that we gave them, very good.  More gooder.  I do believe it's starting to work, huh?  Yeah.  And the listeners certainly helping us out big time by spreading the ONA virus across  America.  Spread it around.  If you like what you're hearing, you've got to kind of tell someone about it, right?  Yeah, that's how it works.  Word of mouth.  Well, we don't need no stinking advertising.  We just do our show, and people seem to talk about it.  That kind of spreads it around.  And then we do stuff like yesterday.  Yeah. 
[00:10:30]  Did you see the video yet?  Yes, I did.  Very, very funny.  Eric Sexbagel, maybe now known as Hawk, he said he couldn't watch the video.  Why?  He just couldn't.  Because he looked like a complete asshole.  Well, I just couldn't bring myself to watch it.  I mean, I know everyone enjoyed it.  But I just couldn't do it.  A little much, yeah?  I guess, yeah.  I just looked at it.  I was like, nah.  You come running around the corner like a complete lunatic.  I saw the stills, yeah. 
[00:11:00]  The stills are really funny.  If you want to see what we're talking about, go to opianthony.com if you're near a computer.  But basically, there's this huge story in New York City here about these hawks.  Yeah.  And these hawks have been hanging out on this building on the east side, just east of Central Park.  I don't know, for years.  Like a decade?  I think 11 years.  11 years?  Okay.  And, you know, bird watchers like to, you know, check out the hawks.  They set up their telescopes, and they check out the hawks.  And the hawks, every once in a while, have little hawklets. 
[00:11:30]  Today, I saw a parrot.  And I went Ed Norton when he was bird watching.  A yellow belly sapsucker.  And, you know, I'll just say I'm in Arizona.  Oh, my God.  Unfortunate.  Today, I saw a parrot.  A parrot.  I just got the Honeymooners box set finally. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, the box set is a must-have for anybody.  They got the original, I guess it was 36 episodes, just hysterical, all remastered.  And they look great, sound great, and they're just so goddamn funny.  I've watched these things each episode since I got the DVDs probably ten times each episode.  Still laugh just as hard.  It's just too goddamn funny.  When Ralph comes home and his mother-in-law is sitting there, and she just lays right into him. 
[00:12:30]  No warming up in the bullpen, huh?  All right, Dizzy Dean.  Just starts lambasting him.  Doesn't even acknowledge he's in the room.  Starts talking to Alice.  Who is that nice boy you used to go out with?  And he's just, ugh, making sounds.  Ugh.  You are a blabbermouth.  Too goddamn funny.  It's a must-have.  Do they have the original Alice?  Do they have any of those in the older ones?  No, no, not the, uh, there's other box sets that you can get. 
[00:13:00]  I don't know if they have the one with the original, different Alice, but the original,  the, uh, the classic episodes, those are the ones that are just so goddamn funny.  Every one of them.  Because the lost episodes aren't as great, right?  No, there's a couple of lost episodes that are really funny, but for the most part, it's  kind of nostalgic, kind of cool to see, uh, uh, some of those episodes.  But the classics.  Yeah, the 36 episodes.  So it's in one box set.  It's just, it's just hilarious.  Every one of them.  When they're going to the convention, the raccoon convention, and they're on the train, 
[00:13:30]  and Norton gets up into the bed and takes the mask and holds it up to Ralph.  Hey, Ralph!  Hey!  Mind if I smoke, Ralph?  Norton, I don't care if you burn.  It just shows you.  They just, uh, they just don't make sitcoms like they used to because, because the Honeymooners,  it was just one freaking set.  That's it.  They were, they pretty much filmed the play, you know?  Yeah.  They didn't need all the fancy sets and, and a lot of guest stars or anything like that.  And, and a lot of those.  It's just basically four freaking people.  One camera.  One camera, right.  A lot of the storylines, plot lines and stuff, they still show up in sitcoms. 
[00:14:00]  They show up in sitcoms today.  It's amazing.  Just funny.  Pure funny.  And it was, the writing for that was so brilliant because they had, they couldn't even allude  to sex.  It was like, content-wise, they were so limited as to what they could talk about.  Yeah.  Those guys were geniuses.  And, uh, it's funnier than anything they're doing.  You really should get the box set.  It's just.  I will.  It's just amazing.  Anthony turned me on to it when we were doing a lot of trips to Washington to kind  of negotiate this satellite radio deal.  It's that train ride.  We were, we were, we were doing the choo-choo back and forth and, uh, we'd hang out and 
[00:14:30]  watch the Honeywinners, uh, you know, going to Washington and coming back to New York  City.  So.  It's only 36 episodes, the originals.  Something like that, right?  Yeah.  36, right?  That's it.  Well, back then they didn't, yeah, they didn't make a hundred episodes and all these sitcoms  brag about the hundredth episode of, uh, Will and Grace or whatever.  They never got to a hundred in the old days.  Well, they didn't do well.  The time was didn't do well.  The public didn't really like it.  Well, a lot of the shows that, uh, we grew up with, they did, they just weren't on the  air as long as you thought.  But some of these, some of these, uh, shows were only on two or three years tops. 
[00:15:00]  Star Trek, only three years and it was a bomb.  It was a bomb.  I didn't know it was a bomb.  It was a total bomb.  And then years later in the seventies and people started getting all weird and, and picked  up on it and it became a huge hit, you know, spawn all kinds of movies and everything.  But when it originally aired, it was crap.  No one paid attention to it.  What is this stupid space movie?  Get this off.  Yeah.  They used to throw the Honeymooners on and then Camelcade, like Lisa had this variety show.  So it'd be like this 10, that's why some of them are 10 minutes, some of them are 18 
[00:15:30]  minutes.  Yeah.  That's why the, uh, the classic episodes were actually made.  You know, they said, we want to have the Honeymooners because sometimes they were part  of the Jackie Gleason show, Jackie Gleason variety show.  And they'd come on and play the characters, you know, the, uh, Cramden's and Norton's and,  and, uh, then they just said to him, Hey, you know, let's put out some of these  shows, just do it as pure Honeymooners.  And, uh, funny, man, all the characters, except I am not a fan of, uh, of Trixie.  Oh, she just can put the, pull the handbrake on any scene, but all of them, Alice is amazing. 
[00:16:00]  You watch that show and a lot of people, I've heard from a lot of like feminists and  stuff that they hate that show because it's just the overbearing 50s style husband.  I got to call you out.  Where are you talking to feminists?  Maybe not heard.  I read actually a lot.  I read a lot.  Fox news channel.  People are, feminists are saying, and they're feminists are saying what people are saying.  How many feminists have you talked to in your life? 
[00:16:30]  I've read things.  I've read things.  I don't think you know one feminist.  Um, no, I don't.  You're right.  I don't.  No, actually, uh, uh, some girlfriends that I've had in the past, some girlfriends' mothers  that I've had in the past, they feel that the Honeymooners is an awful, that things like  I Love Lucy, uh, shows like that are just awful because it's the overbearing husband.  But if you watch the Honeymooners, Alice is constantly just nailing Ralph.  And it's so goddamn funny.  And she, she, she makes him look like an idiot at every turn. 
[00:17:00]  She wins every time.  She wins every battle.  She's funnier than he is.  She's smarter than he is.  Yeah.  She dominates him.  Yeah.  That's, that's, I don't know, I would think she was like the first strong woman on TV was  Alice.  I'm the first woman, woman with an atomic kitchen.  This place looks like Yucca Flats after the blast.  She had some of the best lines in the show.  What am I going to do with peanuts?  Eat them like any other elephant?  If I ever write anything that funny in my act, I'll retire.  Genius. 
[00:17:30]  An episode where they got the, uh, the telephone, Alice gets it installed behind Ralph's back  and, uh, the phone rings and Ralph just picks it up and goes, hello, shut up.  That's that moron Norton calling me to congratulate me that I got a phone.  He just picks it up.  Hello, shut up.  God damn funny.  He was such an ass.  I used to love when he would tell people, why don't you shut up?  It's just such a perfect thing to tell a person.  Or his mother-in-law.  Do you know how he'd like to belt you? 
[00:18:00]  He's talking about beating her.  Who doesn't love that?  Don't forget the 15 minute lecture.  Shut up.  Shut up.  He's smacking Norton around.  There are times he hit him so hard.  Almost put him on the floor.  Great stuff.  Freaking brilliant.  So where were we?  How did we get to the honeymoon?  Oh, because you did the pigeon thing.  Oh, right.  Yeah, so the story in New York, the hawks, and, uh, it's just taken on a life of its own.  Hawks have been hanging out in this really, really nice exclusive building on the east  side and the co-op board of this building decided enough of the hawks, enough of the, of the, 
[00:18:30]  the bird watchers and the people with their telescopes and, uh, the hawks themselves.  I guess they eat the pigeons and then drop the carcasses onto the sidewalk.  How cool would that be to see?  Some hawk dropping a pigeon carcass?  I mean, we're talking about hawks in New York City.  It's, it's just nuts.  Okay?  So, um, we sent Eric there yesterday.  I, I'm recapping for the new listeners.  It's something you gotta do when, uh, you do satellite radio.  People are turning on their radios every day.  Every day.  So, um, we sent Eric out there because there was a news crew and they were doing their 
[00:19:00]  serious story about the hawks in the building.  Yeah.  And Eric comes running from around the corner, flapping his wings like crazy, screaming,  Opie and Anthony.  And then he was supposed to say hawks are faggots, right?  Hawks are faggots.  Did you get the hawks are faggots out?  I said it, but I guess you didn't hear it.  Yeah.  The only reason that you, you, you heard, uh, Opie and Anthony, because the reporter heard  this commotion from behind and turned toward Eric.  So now the mic is sort of in his direction.  And that's her body wasn't blocking the mic anymore. 
[00:19:30]  Right.  So you hear it.  You hear Opie and Anthony.  And then she went back to the camera and did her story while Eric is just flapping his  wings like a freaking lunatic behind the reporter.  It was really, really funny.  And the video is now up on opiananthony.com.  And the stills, if you don't want to download the video, the stills are just freaking, just  brilliant.  Job well done.  I don't know if you should call it brilliant, but it's just.  No, I would call it brilliant.  Brilliant.  And he's so embarrassed by it.  I mean, he's proud, but he's embarrassed.  He doesn't want to see the video. 
[00:20:00]  He just doesn't want to check it out.  It's funny, man.  You should watch it.  He doesn't want to watch it.  Yeah.  He's like Theismann watching that broken leg video.  It's going to be years before he can actually watch it.  That's your Citizen Kane.  You should definitely watch that.  That's it.  That's your shining moment.  This is what people are going to remember me for.  Yeah.  Bella, let's shoot this.  Eric or Glenda.  Oh, can I offer one bit of trivia I forgot to mention?  The only one to get residuals from the Honeymooners was Trixie.  Really?  Joyce Randolph.  Yeah.  Why?  Why only her?  I think none of them knew back then what syndication was. 
[00:20:30]  No, I know, but why her?  I think she had a brother who was a lawyer or a family member who was a lawyer who said  to put something in.  That's what I've been told that made sense.  Wow.  No kidding.  So the assault on the media has started.  I guess that's what I was getting at.  Yes, that we kind of ushered it in yesterday.  We're going to take this whole thing to the next level.  We have to because we can't wait for Washington to market the show anymore.  We just can't.  We're not a priority in the marketing department.  It's very obvious to me.  And, you know, XM Satellite Radio is a huge company.  They have 130 music channels, I don't know, and all sorts of other channels that they 
[00:21:00]  got to market.  It's like running well over 150 radio stations.  Right.  We're just not their priority.  It's obvious.  You know, I'm not going to sit around anymore.  And one of the things we do is this assault on the media where the fans get involved and  we give out great prizes.  I think we could sneak some more of my fives out of the hands of Washington.  Oh, wow.  Imagine that.  Some portable satellite radios.  And we're just looking for you guys to get on live TV and make fools of yourselves.  Imagine that.  Put yourselves out there, so to speak. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  In the past, we had the guy in the Gumby suit we talked about yesterday.  Gumby was great.  The gorilla suit was one of my favorites.  I believe that was a story out in Jersey about some kind of atomic power plant or something.  Yeah, the guy's doing a very, very serious.  Very serious.  Like, we all might be melting in the coming months.  The community outrage for this nuclear power plant.  And here comes this jack-off with an Opie and Anthony sign dressed in a gorilla suit.  Doesn't he throw the sign right in front of the reporter's face? 
[00:22:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He gets right behind the reporter, reaches up over his head, and sticks the sign right  in front of the reporter's face.  The shock in the reporter's face is hysterical, too.  And they're so pissed off.  These reporters, you don't even understand how happy they are to get that shot.  Like, hey, you're going out tonight.  You got a story.  Every story they do is something to stuff their resume with, to maybe build their career up.  So it's very important to them.  They take it very seriously. 
[00:22:30]  Yes, yes, yes, yes.  And to have an idiot with a gorilla suit waving a sign in front of his face and show him all  flustered, that immediately goes from his resume to the Christmas gag reel.  And he's very aggravated with it.  They get very pissed.  You think the C word is on someone's Christmas gag reel?  Oh, of course it is.  Real?  She was doing that story, hoping that would be the one that catapults her to NBC prime  time.  Yeah, before you explain that one, so we did this assault on the media, which we're bringing  back officially ONA Army, so let's get this going. 
[00:23:00]  It got to the point, it got so huge that the reporters started doing their live shots from  on top of the news vans.  Yeah.  Yeah, they didn't want to be on the street.  Feeling they would be safe up high and none of our lunatics would attack them.  Wrong.  Wrong.  Yeah, because you don't understand, this got huge.  Yeah.  So this fine young reporter, I think her name's Melissa Russo, right?  Right, very good.  Melissa Russo, I think she was working at NBC here in New York. 
[00:23:30]  I don't know where she is now, if she's still there or whatever.  And she's on the van reporting about some kind of the tour bus thing, the tour bus strike  or something.  Oh, right, right.  Whatever.  The bus is actually, it was the nasty New York City Apple tour buses that were blowing  out that black smoke everywhere you went with the mutants that sit on top taking videos.  Go home.  People are working here.  Thank you.  You just don't like the tourists in New York.  Hate them.  Anyway, so our ultimate goal was to get the C word on live TV. 
[00:24:00]  And Psycho Mark was working for us at the time.  We called it the atomic bomb.  The atomic bomb.  You just don't get any bigger than the C word.  We had to make believe that it was one of our listeners.  I guess we could talk about it now.  We had to make believe it was one of our listeners so we wouldn't get fired.  Yeah.  Like, oh, no, we've been doing this assault on the media.  We didn't know they were going to put the C word on live TV.  Yeah, we can't be held responsible for what other people do.  I'm sorry.  Less.  Less Moonves.  It wasn't us.  It was one of our crazy listeners.  Okay.  You guys can keep your jobs.  All right.  We understand. 
[00:24:30]  Blah, blah, blah.  Keep your jobs for 10 more minutes.  Right.  Yeah, maybe for maybe 10 more months.  So, Psycho Mark, I guess he got on the shoulders of some listener, right?  Yeah.  Because she was up on the van doing the live shot.  Trying to be safe.  And on live TV, he lifted up the C word.  There it is.  C-U-N-T.  Clear as a bell.  Right in the shot as she's talking.  So, the assault on the media has begun again, I guess.  And if someone could do one in the near future, we'll give you a mi-fi. 
[00:25:00]  How does that sound?  Wow.  And I've just been handed this note from our executive producer, Ben Sparks, whose hair  is looking very calm so far today.  Ben, what's the matter?  Oh, there it goes.  Okay.  He just did it up.  It was looking kind of neat.  I know.  I should put some...  Going backwards?  You put some jellies?  Oh, you got it?  Yeah.  Only because he said Audie Meadows was the only cast member.  So, I said Joyce Randolph.  I said, actually, when I said Audie Meadows, and I said Joyce Randolph.  My fault.  And so, Jackie Gleason doesn't even know how she arranged this deal. 
[00:25:30]  All right, so...  Because he was drunk and womanizing at the time.  No, you were asking me about...  Well, he was asking about my hair, and then you were talking about the note I handed him.  All right, yeah.  Tonight, there will be an assault on the media, greatest hits on opianthony.com, just to give  you all the examples of what happened in the past, to give you guys some ideas.  Websites running best of.  Isn't that great?  Well, there's so many good ones.  There's so many good ones. 
[00:26:00]  Steve's just going to load them all up on opianthony.com, so you can see what we're talking  about.  We like creativity.  It's so easy to kind of just yell and scream opianthony on live TV, but when you start dressing  up like Gumby or the gorilla mask, I'm trying to remember...  Clever signs are really funny.  Right.  The things that are really inside on the show, very funny.  Something that our listeners would completely get, but the person doing the report wouldn't.  Things like that.  Oh, here's the picture of the Gumby guy. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, I just got that.  Oh, you just saw that?  Okay.  It is radio, so whatever.  Okay.  So there you go.  Did you want to talk to Steve real fast?  Do you want to do this now, or do you want to wait?  Steve, I've re-entered the world of parody.  Yeah, get Martini Steve in here.  He's on his way.  That's our pal.  Our pal Steve.  On the show today, by the way, Tommy Chong.  Yeah.  Coming in at 9 o'clock.  We were thinking of playing Stoner Spelling Bee in honor of Tommy Chong. 
[00:27:00]  Fresh out of jail.  If we could get...  How many contestants would we need for Stoner Spelling Bee?  Like four or five?  Four would probably work better.  Tom Cruise, Tommy Chong, whatever.  Oh, people thought that was a gag yesterday.  No, stop it.  I was reading email, and they're like, how many people were buying that you were going  to have Tom Cruise on your show yesterday?  Because we've done that in the past.  No, Tom Cruise was on the...  We were on the list of places that Tom Cruise had a call yesterday morning.  Right.  I'm sure we were at the bottom of the list, but...  Yes.  We were the one with the big X through it. 
[00:27:30]  We were right under the Scott Peterson variety hour.  Just add them to the list of people that have blown us off, that were scheduled to appear  on our show.  That list includes Anthony Michael Hall, that list includes Brian Williams, and now Tom  Cruise.  I'll just say, you know, some successful people.  We get blown off by the best, though, it looks like, huh?  Well, Anthony Michael Hall.  Louis Black.  Louis Black blowing us off.  Louis Black now blowing us off until he, what, has a book out or something?  Whatever. 
[00:28:00]  Hey, Steve, what's going on, man?  Hey, Ope.  How are you doing?  Hey.  There he is.  There you go.  I'm not seeing as much flame wear.  Only on this one little side.  Yeah, I know.  One side of his hat is flaming.  Trimmed it down.  Trimmed it down.  You have to take these things in moderation.  That just seems like the pilot light.  Really?  Like, he hasn't lit himself up yet, but he's got a pilot light that's always on upon his  hat.  Actually, I think they're all in the wash, so, you know, I have to, yeah, you know, I've  got six or seven flame shirts in the wash right now, so you've got to rotate them. 
[00:28:30]  Sizzling.  Are you excited about Friday?  Are you going to have more food coming down here?  I hope so.  I hope so.  We have a lot of people coming from, coming, hopefully, from out of state, too.  We've got a lot of, um...  Well, we're talking about the eggnog drinking contest.  Oh, yeah.  That's happening Friday.  You know what?  We have to, we have to just tell folks, because people are getting a little scared.  We're not going to have Stalker Patty's pubes in the eggnog, okay?  Yeah, don't worry.  Come down.  Just come down.  Yeah, that's actually been getting emailed in a lot.  That was more for us to just kind of have some wacky fun with everybody. 
[00:29:00]  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!  So don't worry about the Stalker Patty toenails or the pubes, okay?  It's just going to be eggnog.  It's just going to be an eggnog drinking contest.  It's last man standing, we'll win a MiFi, the portable XM satellite radio.  That's the hottest Christmas gift this season, okay?  Yep.  And Steve, once again, is requesting, if you come down here on Friday, to bring food.  Yeah, that's...  Bring food for Steve and toilet paper for Ben.  Right.  Exactly.  Because for some reason, that's a way to tell who's getting in. 
[00:29:30]  It was when we had a whole bunch of people.  The crowd, I don't know what Steve's whole logic to that was.  One place has been reserved for the person that comes the furthest.  Yeah, we had actually a guy email last night from Arizona.  Wow.  He said he'd be willing to make the trip.  Really?  Yeah.  He's just going to start driving now?  He's taking a plane.  I hope that's not Mike Tyson.  He'll fly.  Yeah, he's taking a plane.  They kind of got that stuff down, though.  Oh, yeah.  Why don't we always take in trains and cars and...  Because we're cheap. 
[00:30:00]  We drove to Cleveland.  XM is cheap.  Who drives to Cleveland from New York?  We do, evidently.  I was doing a little vehicle shakedown for the Cleveland Drive.  I was going to fly.  Yeah.  And then I just got a new vehicle.  I was like, I want to check out the navigation system, see if it knows where Cleveland is.  There you go.  Wasn't that when XM couldn't get the flight information, got a little screwed up?  That was another thing.  I was kind of forced into it.  Kind of like the Vegas trip that's coming up.  You don't hear about the flights until it's 5 in the morning.  You get a call.  Oh, that's right.  You've got to be at the plane.  Oh, what?  Wow.  All right. 
[00:30:30]  So the MiFi thing is happening Friday.  People just show up at the station before the show?  And then you guys will kind of pick who comes up?  Well, we're going to try to streamline it as much as possible, but we're going to have  extra help.  I think Kenny's going to be here helping out, just because the requests are flooding, and  we've got another few hundred people asking if they can drink a whole gallon of eggnog  for a MiFi.  You think they could drink a gallon?  People are claiming that they can drink a gallon.  There's two ways to get out of this contest.  Either you have to take a leak. 
[00:31:00]  If you leave the studio and take a leak, you're out.  Out.  Or if you puke.  Or if you puke.  I think it's going to be the puking that's going to be.  I think a lot of people are going to barf.  I really do.  I've seen this before.  It doesn't work well.  And what are we doing?  It's a double shot of eggnog every minute?  Right.  Double shot every minute.  Is that not going to last 20 minutes?  No.  You've got to stretch it out a little bit.  Double shot every two minutes?  No, no.  It's got to be every minute.  Will they be out?  Because 20 double shots of eggnog are going to puke.  Got to see who's going to be the champ.  We've got some 300 pounders that are emailing in saying it's a pussy challenge. 
[00:31:30]  I don't know.  Plus the fact, you know, with the brand new Opie and Anthony show,  we're trying to not stretch our bits all day because we actually have material to do.  You're going to do it all day.  Right.  So maybe it's a quick little half hour, 40 minute contest when it's all said and done, right?  Right.  All right.  If they last longer, they last longer.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  So that's happening.  And Steve, we were just saying, and I know you're in the other room,  there's going to be an assault on the media, greatest hits on opianthony.com?  Working on it.  Working on it.  I'll have them up throughout the day. 
[00:32:00]  But the real reason you're in here.  Oh, yes.  Martini, Steve.  Oh.  Anthony came out of retirement.  Yes, I did.  Want to explain it?  I've gotten soft over the years, Opie.  You know what got me into radio in the first place was writing the O.J. Simpson song parody.  Wrote the Gun Electric Shock O.J.  Are you going to be writing a follow-up Gun Electric Shock Scott Peterson?  Scott Peterson?  No.  But I haven't written a song parody in a while.  And I was so inspired, Steve. 
[00:32:30]  So inspired by Steve and his flaming clothing that I had to go back to write another parody.  It's touching.  It really is.  Collaborated with my brother, brother Joe, who did the music.  And we put it together.  Yeah.  I'm very touched.  Thank you, Steve.  I heard it before, and it's impressive.  And the fact that Joe was able to put all that work into putting the music together.  And you actually sang the track. 
[00:33:00]  I mean, that's it.  What an honor.  Hold on.  We've got to take one step backwards real fast.  Jason in New Hampshire.  What's up, Jason?  What's up, guys?  Hey, real fast.  What do you got?  Hey, you know, you've got to revise your rules a little bit.  Why?  You said if you've got to leave the studio to piss.  Right.  You're out.  Well, you know somebody's going to piss in a trash can.  And Norton's going to be pulling on himself.  But what if they're wearing diapers?  Hmm.  Do we check them for diapers?  We've got to check everyone.  If you wear diapers, you've earned the right to stand there and urine it on yourself.  You know, I almost agree with you, Jimmy. 
[00:33:30]  But you've got to at least tell us that you're wearing diapers.  You can pee your pants if you wear diapers.  This place is going to stink.  You know what?  Yeah, if you take a leak in studio, out of studio, you're out.  If you leak, you're out.  Okay.  No leaks.  All right, so back to the song that Anthony made for Martini Steve.  Yeah.  Ready to play this thing?  Sure.  All right, check it out.  It's the Martini Steve song.  You know he's got some flaming shoes 
[00:34:00]  The kind that Pyro would admire  It makes contestants bring in food  And it runs the Foundry Music Empire  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire  He only buys flaming attire  His clothing's like a barbecue 
[00:34:30]  His laundry never needs a dryer  If you're selling burning shoes  This drunken Lebanese will fire  This drunken Lebanese will fire  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire  The only buys flaming attire  He only buys flaming attire  You know he's got some flaming shoes 
[00:35:00]  The kind that Satan would desire  If you're with him drinking booze  The smoke detector is required  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire  He only buys flaming attire  He only buys flaming attire  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire 
[00:35:30]  Martinez, these clothes are on fire  There you go.  Very nice.  A little tribute to your flaming clothes, Steve.  Gotta love that.  I like how you got the flaming clothes, the alcoholism, and the Lebanese.  Lebanese, bring the food, and foundry music.  Oh, yeah, exactly.  All that stuff.  A little foundry music.  I appreciate that.  No problem.  That's really touching, man. 
[00:36:00]  That's great.  I'm a little disappointed you're not wearing more flames today, though.  I'll make up for it tomorrow.  I will have flaming boots, flaming shirt, flaming hat.  People can't see your face.  When he's hearing that song, he looks like one of the girls that Johnny Fontaine was singing to.  Yeah, you were just...  Well, that's also partially because one of my eyes is tearing up because I clocked myself in the head yesterday.  But other than that...  With what?  A cardboard box.  I know.  Stupid.  He's trying to put himself out and hit himself. 
[00:36:30]  You've got to give props to your brother there.  Oh, yeah.  That's great.  Joe's the music guy.  I guess he just shows up at your house with all the equipment.  He's hysterical.  He shows up yesterday.  He's got his truck, and he just comes into my house with a little mixing board and microphones and sets up.  We blow it out, and then he leaves.  And I'm like, you're like a doctor making a house call, you know?  Parody done.  You'll get my bill.  Just burns it right there in the house.  Yeah.  Burns it.  Hands you the disc. 
[00:37:00]  Here you go.  This was a piece of cake.  Thank you.  Good to get back into making a little song parody.  All right.  And to do it to Steve, one of our favorites.  Thank you, Anthony.  We found your music wear today.  Yeah, well, they're easy because I have so many of these effing shirts.  What a lousy, stupid idea this was.  What?  What?  Never make 150 shirts so you're not sure that people would buy 10 of them.  People don't buy them with the FM on it?  That's fantastic.  I love the logo.  Actually, they would if we could figure out how to sell them easier. 
[00:37:30]  I just got lazy and decided I didn't like mailing these effing things out.  So we're working on it.  How many have you sold?  Actually, we did sell them.  We probably sold like 200 of them so far.  Out of 150?  I know.  I probably have 150 left out of like 400.  No one cares.  Anyway, thank you.  No one cares.  Thank you, Anthony, for dragging me through that.  There he goes.  Martini Steve, everyone.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  You want to do this Doors thing?  We'll do another little Doors thing.  It's from Madden 2005. 
[00:38:00]  It's Snoop Dogg and the Doors doing Riders on the Storm.  Cool.  It's a cool little mashup.  We'll regroup.  We'll talk about the Scott Peterson thing in a little while.  Also, Stoner Spelling Bee, in or out?  You guys want to try to get some stoners?  We need four or five people to smoke a lot of pot and try to spell today.  Always fun.  In honor of Tommy Chong stopping by the studio.  Oh, a tie-in.  Our big guest.  Our big guest today is Tommy Chong.  Will he be showing up?  He's a legend.  Will he be showing up, though, Ben?  I'm very psyched.  He is a legend.  He is a legend. 
[00:38:30]  He's legendary.  All right.  And, wow, lots of things to talk about as I look at our list here.  So let's play this, and we'll be back.  Hey, yo, Jim, man, why don't you kick some of that, you know?  You know how you do it, man.  It's a trip people don't even believe we're together right now.  But tell your story.  You know what I like.  Say it for me. 
[00:39:00]  Riders on the storm.  Riders on the storm.  Into this house we're born.  Into this world we're thrown.  Like a dog without a bone.  An actor out or known.  Riders on the storm.  There's a killer on the road. 
[00:39:30]  His brain is squirming like a toad.  Take a long holiday.  Let your children play.  If you give this man a ride, sweet family will die.  Killer on the road.  Killer on the road.  Yeah.  Goin' off of this, goin' off of that.  With the Lizard King bumpin' in the back. 
[00:40:00]  How about that?  Driftin', liftin', swiftin'.  Coastin', testin', roastin'.  But the wheels won't stop.  200 on the highway, fresh up off the block.  He's a ride.  Nah, he's a killer.  Dressed in all black, but his hat says still.  Pettle to the metal.  I gotta go hard, drive by, and say hello.  Hey, Fred Wreck, you my melder.  Now let me hear what I sound like acapella.  Roll, ride, dim, sweat.  Now bring it back, just like this. 
[00:40:30]  Like a dog without his bone.  I like a G without his chrome.  It's hard to imagine.  The homie dog in the jag and he checkin' for the checkered flag.  Comin' in first.  Never in last.  Cause my car too fast.  I never ever run out of gas.  Cause I'm just too clean.  I do it up a class.  So fast in your seatbelts.  It's so hot.  It'll even make heat melt.  So get a ball.  And roll.  And ride.  Slip through the shore.  Like a dog without a bone. 
[00:41:00]  An actor out alone.  Riders on the storm.  There's a killer on the road.  His brain is squirming like a toad.  Take a long holiday.  Let your children play.  If you give this man a ride, sweet family will die. 
[00:41:30]  Killer on the road.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Awake in India.  Need for speed.  I'm trying to take the lead.  Hold on, little homie, for you run into the trees.  I see things that I never would have saw before. 
[00:42:00]  Ayo, Jim.  Let them in.  Let them in.  Open up.  My back tire smoking up the whole street.  And now the police want to flash their lights.  And chase the dog all night.  But I won't blow over.  Nor give up.  Cause I just don't give up.  Yeah.  I'm from the side, boy.  When we was born and raised.  Straight up to ride, boy.  Continuously.  We get to it expeditiously.  Keep the light on.  East side on.  Slow dog in the doors. 
[00:42:30]  And yeah, we about to ride.  Riders on the storm.  Riders on the storm.  Into this house we're born.  Into this world we're thrown.  Like a dog without a bone.  An actor out on loan.  Riders on the storm.  Riders on the storm. 
[00:43:00]  Riders on the storm.  Riders on the storm.  Riders on the storm.  And let's ride.  Riders on the storm.  Thank you. 
[00:43:30]  Thank you.

The number one family resort in North America, where family fun is always guaranteed.  Call 1-800-451-8752 or visit Smuggs.com.  Cold weather to the eastern mountains making a huge difference with snow making ready to go right through the week.  Sunday River in Maine, already with 47 runs and 17 miles.  They head down mostly loose, granular, and patch-powdered snow. 
[00:48:00]  Snowshoe Mountain in West Virginia starting strong with another inch of new snow.  They're ready today with eight runs.  The Spruce Glades and Tubing will open up on Thursday at Snowshoe Mountain.  Out west, where the skiing continues to impress like at Vail.  176 trails off of 29 lifts.  Also in Colorado, Breckenridge now up to 60 runs.  Half of their trails open, plus their half-pipe already.  Jackson Hole in Wyoming, over half of their trails already open with patch-powder.  Park City, Utah, up to 60 trails open.  I'm John Davis with the XM Radio Ski and Snowboard Report. 
[00:48:30]  Anthony Show, XM 202.  And we're back with the ONA Show.  Thanks for tuning in. 
[00:49:00]  All right, so back to the hawk thing, right?  We went off on a few tendons.  So it's the big story in town.  These stupid hawks on the top of this building.  They were living there for years.  Bird watchers, bird watchers, documentaries made about them, people with their telescopes, pigeon carcasses hitting the sidewalk.  The snooty fucks that live in the building, very pissed off.  The co-op board gets involved.  And they pretty much remove the nest or make it where the hawks can't use the nest anymore.  Hawks flying around crazy trying to find a new place to nest. 
[00:49:30]  News media get involved.  People gawking.  People protesting.  So we sent Danny up there to mess with some of the people.  Danny.  Sit down, Danny.  I would, but there's no chair here.  Oh, my God.  Are you that short or is the mic too high for you?  Mic's too high.  Yeah.  Is that better?  Yeah.  Steve's level.  Yeah, it was at Steve's level.  How tall are you?  Like 5'5"?  5'6"?  Yeah, about 5'6".  All right, so Danny went up there and messed with the people a little bit.  He's getting better and better with messing with the people on the street. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  So what was the scene like up there?  I mean, it wasn't anything too spectacular.  It was maybe about 15, 20 people.  A lot of them had telescopes and these, I don't even know what you would call it.  It's just this huge, huge scope.  And the guy had it hooked up to a closed circuit camera and they were just following the hawk  around wherever it moved to.  Just a couple people with signs, nothing really special.  But was that guy in the park?  Or now he's on the sidewalk?  No, he's on the sidewalk.  Well, because that guy usually sets up shop in the actual park. 
[00:50:30]  And what, he's got like a big telephoto lens?  It's a massive telescope.  It's huge.  On a video camera?  And then it's set up to, then he has, yeah, a monitor there.  So all the tours and stuff hang out and watch what he's seeing through the telescope.  Is he taping this for something?  No, I don't think he's taping it for anything, but that was one of the issues that came up.  Dude, this guy's there every day for hours upon hours.  All day long.  He's making a documentary and it's called I Am An Asshole.  I need a job.  Why doesn't some homeless guy hit him over the head and absconded his wares? 
[00:51:00]  Ooh.  Nice think.  Wow, that was a really big word.  I'm going to have to look that one up when I get home.  How do you spell that?  W-E-A-L-Q-R.  There it is.  A wares.  W-A-R-E-S.  So it's pretty much just a freak show up there.  Did you see anyone dressed as hawks?  Yeah, well, actually, there was this one guy in an eagle costume.  An eagle costume.  An eagle.  Yeah.  Nice.  All right, so let's go to the audio and see what Danny got here. 
[00:51:30]  A bunch of dopes.  The first one is a rambling Upper East Side lady.  Oh, yeah, she was one of the ones with the signs and she saw the XM Mike flag and felt that it was so important she just had to tell the story.  Oh, okay, so she's going to tell her side of this fiasco.  Yeah, people have some wacky signs up there, too, right?  Next time we've got to send you, you know, send him with a digital camera.  When do they get out there in the afternoon?  Yeah, I suppose so.  I mean, when Eric was out there and no one was there, obviously, I showed up probably about 2 o'clock and there was maybe about 15 people. 
[00:52:00]  A perfect opportunity for the ONA Army to get on TV.  Assault on the media.  I heard you went on TV.  I tried.  But they were taping.  Yeah, it wasn't live.  It was taped.  I just whipped out a wow sticker and just started waving it around.  And the minute I had crossed the street, the cameraman gave the guy the signal to do it again.  So I was like, nah, shit.  You got to, well, you don't know when they're going to, sometimes you see these, you know, camera crews set up, you're not sure if they're going live or they're just taping a little something.  If you're a little savvy, you could kind of tell because they really set it up and you know it's time sensitive and they're standing there a little while longer than they would if they were just taping it. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  All right.  So here's the first clip.  Now, what is it about the hawk that made this little gathering happen on the street here?  It's a great New York story.  Here in this urban environment, you have these two beautiful hawks mating and on a Fifth Avenue building.  They've won the hearts of not just New Yorkers, but people coming from all over the world. 
[00:53:00]  They used to pass and see the scopes out.  Didn't know.  Let me have a look at the scopes.  Oh, they said, oh, my God.  You can just hear how rich she is.  Oh, she's just dripping cash.  She's just dripping like, yeah, diamonds.  Hurry, lovey.  We're going to get to the boat.  Yeah.  Lovey, we're going to miss our cruise.  Sounds a little bit like Julia Child.  Yeah.  Oh, she did.  A little bit.  Hawk would look great in a pot with a little marinara.  But you can just hear how rich she is. 
[00:53:30]  Hit the bird over the head with a rolling pin and roll it out.  It's wonderful.  This lady hasn't.  Just like chicken.  This lady hasn't worked a day in her life.  No.  No.  Because it's all old money on the east side.  All old money.  She has all her face pulled back with makeup on, walking a little dog.  She was pretty heavily covered because it was a little chilly out there yesterday.  So she had like the huge goose down parka.  Those old broads up there in the rich part of town, they've had so much surgery.  They got like a snatch on their chin. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  And their eyes are pulled back like Asians.  They look like Stepford Wives.  Expressionless.  They're just expressionless.  Oh, expressionless.  But not beautiful.  Well, some of them, you know.  They're ancient.  They're ancient with really creepy, tight young faces.  They have that visible body legs that show through where you can see all the veins and  nerves and stuff through their translucent skin.  No one's worse than that Jocelyn Windenstein.  You know the one?  Oh, yeah.  The cat woman.  Yeah.  She's just some woman that made a ton of money on her divorce. 
[00:54:30]  She got so much plastic surgery.  She doesn't even look.  Her eyes don't even close anymore.  She looks like that kid from Mask.  Yeah, she's in the paper all the time.  Her eyes don't close?  No.  Yeah.  They've been pulled so tight that they don't close all the way anymore.  She's got a big head and it does.  It looks like the kid from Mask.  Really?  Yeah.  How does she sleep?  Maybe with a blindfold.  My eyes would dry out if I slept with them all the way.  She's running, little running faucets.  A clockwork orange.  In her eyes.  She's got a guy dripping.  Turn it off, I beg you. 
[00:55:00]  All right, back to the tape here.  They said, oh my God, look what's going on.  Right in the middle of this urban environment.  That must be me behind her.  All the orphans have gathered.  Not all, but many of us that love these birds and have come out here.  And the thing has grown.  The story has gotten legs.  People are coming and it grows.  Yesterday was a mad scene out here.  They had to send the police over because it didn't get unruly.  It just became enormous.  What happened?  Well, it was just a huge crowd. 
[00:55:30]  We were all spilling out into the street.  We had two people in bird costumes running around.  It was getting a little out of control.  Yeah.  What happened?  What happened?  It didn't exactly work the way.  Wreck of the day.  Wreck of the day in Stanford.  Wow, is that a mess.  Yep.  From Chopper 4 live.  Oh, they'll have it hosed down in a few minutes.  It's just amazing.  Every morning is the wreck of the day.  That's a bad one.  What did it fall off of a cliff?  I don't know.  What's going on there?  Oh, and then stuck in that traffic. 
[00:56:00]  Look at that traffic.  Connecticut just stinks.  Look at that traffic.  Nothing but miles and miles of light.  Oh, my God.  They keep going and going and going.  It's a satellite shot.  That is a good 10-mile backup.  Oh, the chopper is just in the sky and it slowly pans back.  Yeah, the traffic goes on forever.  The worst part is if you're in that and you just hit it, you're going, I hope this isn't  too long.  We all know it's about two hours worth of traffic. 
[00:56:30]  Is there anything worse or better, actually, than when you're coming down the other way  on traffic and you see the wreck and you see six miles and you know people pulling up,  you're like, oh, scumbag.  You're going to have to sit in that for a while, pally.  Hope you have a nice log brewing, stupid.  Hope you had a smoothie at work.  Oh, God, that hurts me every day.  It comes out thick and heavy like a soft serve.  That's what I was saying to Opie before.  I use the same.  I'd like a frozen yogurt.  It makes you feel like you're 10 months old again. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, it's awful.  Enough with the smoothies.  I know.  That's what I'm thinking.  They're tasty, but they empty out.  They are so tasty, and I think they do clean you out.  Yeah, clean out your system.  All right.  Well, let's go to the second clip.  It says, Turf War with Falun Gong.  What's that about?  Well, I figured since they had signs and they were kind of protesting something,  I figured maybe the Falun Gong was trying to step on their toes a little bit,  so I kind of asked about it.  Good.  All right.  Let's take a listen here.  Now, I see that you're holding sign.  Your sign says, Bring Back the Nest.  Her sign says, New York Loves Hawks. 
[00:57:30]  Have you had any turf war conflicts with the Falun Gong?  No, no.  They're a separate entity altogether.  They have their own grievances.  Yeah, I was wondering that maybe they didn't want you invading their turf.  Maybe there was going to be a beef that was going to air out on the streets of New York.  They've actually been set up all along Park Avenue, and they have a very serious, I mean,  that's human abuse, and it's very tragic.  But this is not the end of the world.  God knows there are worse things than this, but they're the room over the nest. 
[00:58:00]  And if 927 doesn't rebuild, they'll find another nest.  It's just that it's such a touching story for we New Yorkers that love these two birds.  Touching.  It's not touching.  I like how you did that interview at the Summit of Everest.  Yeah, I know.  What the hell was that wind?  It was windy.  You've got to stand in front of that mic when it's windy like that, huh?  No, it's great.  Not that I care, but these rich bitches are carrying on about these hawks that are flying  above, and I guarantee this homeless guy is just sleeping right next to the park that 
[00:58:30]  haven't had a good meal or a shower in years.  And they don't care about them.  Oh, they step over the homeless to make sure they get a bird's-eye view of the hawks.  Well, I was saying that.  I mean, one of the things I was asking these people was just like, don't you think there's  something better that you could try to be bringing attention to than some bird's nest that got  misplaced?  Yeah, no, this is a typical rich person.  They could realize if a homeless guy was trying to live where those pigeons are living, like  in the doorway or something, or their building, they would do everything they could to get 
[00:59:00]  him thrown out of there.  Yeah, dropping their squirrel carcasses on the sidewalk.  Yeah, after munching on some squirrel.  Or his liquor-laced homeless man feces.  Right.  Just smeared down the side of the building.  You have to hold an umbrella when you get a camp.  Save the hawks, kill the homeless.  Yeah, that's the signs they would hold up if they could.  Oh, of course.  But now they have a little cause.  They have something they'd yap to their mahjong player friends with. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, they're all socialized at the next cocktail party.  They'll talk about what they did to save the hawks.  You know, I helped with the hawks to save the hawks.  What did you do?  Oh, well, I actually got on an XM radio show, and I'm sure, I'm certain that helped.  It was actually funny.  One of the guys I asked, I said, don't you have a job to go to?  And he just goes, no, I'm rich.  That was actually one of the guys I spoke to.  Honest answer.  Yeah, well, that's what's going on on the east side.  It's all old money.  Oh, Gilligan, put the nest back up. 
[01:00:00]  That's Fifth Avenue money.  That is real New York money, too.  It's just real, and it's just huge dollar amounts.  You'll see some of those mansions that they have on, it's just, you go like in the 70s  and Fifth Avenue up by the park there.  It's embarrassing how much money some people have.  Yeah.  Lovey, we'll make them another nest out of cash.  We have plenty of that lying around.  Can we go up there with like a BB gun or something?  Oh!  Oh!  You can't take out the hawks.  How funny would that be? 
[01:00:30]  You just show up.  Doink!  With a gun and a scope, and they would lose.  They're mines.  Oh, they would.  I would do that gag if we didn't get arrested for having, you know, some firearms.  A gun?  Yeah, you probably can't go around with even a pellet gun.  Or even a fake gun.  They'll take you down.  It would be funny to go in like total hunter gear with a blind, set up a blind.  Bar!  Bar!  Bar!  It's not like doing duck calls and just sitting there with a rifle.  Looking at the horrified looks on the people's faces.  What are you doing? 
[01:01:00]  Well, I heard a couple of birds up there just looking to do a little hunting.  All right, let's go back to the audio.  This town is covered in poo, and you have a fight with the old lady?  The same lady?  No, actually, some lady that was listening in on the whole conversation.  Oh!  And she's against the hawk thing?  No, she just, she had a problem, I guess, with what I was asking.  All right, let's take a listen.  This town is covered in poo.  What's a little more poo?  Well, that's the whole point.  So what's a little bit more schmutz?  I mean, why don't, if they want to clean something up, why don't they clean up?  Because all these doors are so uptight. 
[01:01:30]  I know, but I'm saying if they, if, I know that.  Like a Howard Stern one.  No!  No, absolutely not, miss.  Absolutely not, miss.  Who say, who's being funny?  Thank you.  Listen, on Central Park South.  Central Park South is covered in horse, in horse crap.  Mark gave, gave this story legs.  We like the press.  She should not be shouting at me.  I know, this is, this is going to get national attention, miss.  Yeah, that's what we want.  We want to, I know.  Some people are misguided.  She was just pissed off at the questions you were asking. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, it wasn't even that bad.  You weren't, you haven't even really, uh, attacked her or anything.  Pardon my French, but you're an asshole.  You are an asshole.  What a, what a C word.  Can you, Baila, can you tell a lady if she uses the expression, have legs again for the story?  It's the worst.  Schmutz.  Has legs.  Schmutz.  Schmutz.  Oh, yeah, we really couldn't tell what, uh, ethnic background you had.  Yeah.  Before you said schmutz, living up there with all the, all your money. 
[01:02:30]  How awful is that?  All right, look, 300, but you have to schmutz on my chest.  Yeah, Jim, you can probably help him out.  Tell him how to put the plastic down so it doesn't get all over the place.  You're a dirty birdie.  Teehee.  Let's go back to the tape here.  I know that the city already has one hook-nosed nuisance spilling crap from the sky.  Do you really think that we need another one?  I don't know of any others. 
[01:03:00]  We have two here.  Yeah, he broadcasts from K-Rod.  You're here.  You're in the middle of 50.  Oh, you're talking about how it's there?  Oh.  I have to wake up.  Oh, that's a beautiful dog, Weiner.  Why the hell does he keep that in?  Well, that clip was a complete waste of time.  It's a beautiful dog, a Weiner, Weiner.  A Weiner-anner.  Yeah, I'm so glad that I spent, like, an hour of time coding all this stuff for Steve to find the best stuff for him.  Yeah, he, well, Steve is half asleep most of the time. 
[01:03:30]  Flame on!  Flame on.  Okay, another Falun Gong turf war thing here.  Do you know if there's any kind of turf war conflict between these guys and the Falun Gong?  Not that I know of.  Do you know the Falun Gong?  Sure.  Do you know that they can turn invisible?  Only after they levitate.  No, why?  They have to levitate first.  No, because I spoke to them a couple days ago, and they said they don't have X-ray vision, but they can turn invisible.  Right.  That's a fact.  I asked them to ask.  Now you're just getting silly. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, the wheels are falling off this bit here.  Getting a little uncomfortable.  The wacky people are supposed to be the people you're talking to.  Right.  All right, let's try this one.  Is this the bird that can burst into Steve and be reborn from the ashes?  The phoenix?  Yeah.  I'm not sure.  Burst.  Original or extra crispy?  Extra crispy.  Good answer.  Good answer, sir.  Good answer. 
[01:04:30]  So there weren't many people down there?  Not really.  And the thing was, I just couldn't beat the crap out of somebody because there wasn't any new people that were joining this little gathering.  So if I pissed one of them off, no one would want to talk to me.  So I kind of had to keep it a little light.  Gotcha.  Light.  A little light.  A little levery.  Well, people want to hear the last one.  All right.  You're talking to a guy from Montana here?  Yeah.  This guy was nuts.  Have you ever eaten wild meat before? 
[01:05:00]  Wild meat?  Yeah.  Isn't that that shit that grows off your body?  Like, they call them skin tags?  No, like an animal that wasn't filled with steroids in a feedlot and given to you.  Are you a vegetarian, sir?  No, I'm a hunter.  You're a hunter?  Where do you hunt?  In Montana, where I live.  You live in Montana?  Yeah.  Wow.  What's there to do in Montana?  Whatever you want.  They have, like, shoes?  They have shoes?  Yeah, they got shoe stores.  They got all sorts of stuff.  Even for people like you who wouldn't know how to, you know, make a shoe or a blanket or a... 
[01:05:30]  So the people in Montana make their own shoes?  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  Everybody makes their own shoes or just select people?  No, everybody does.  It's, you know, you grow up and you're given sort of a direction for your shoe color, shoe style.  And you're born into a little shoe tribe.  Dances, costumes, songs, whole traditions.  But what if you're born a little slow?  Are you still allowed to make your own shoes or do they have someone make them for you?  No, they got slow shoes, fast shoes, sideways shoes, upside... 
[01:06:00]  So slow people make slow shoes.  Yeah, and that way they're not very slow at all.  They're just doing their thing.  Do the shoes drool, too?  No.  No, they don't.  Was the guy drooling?  No, I figured it's slow people.  Yeah, drool.  No, we're drooling.  I know.  I'm sitting here like, what?  How did it get here?  It was...  It was the bird story.  I'm talking about shoes in Montana.  But out of the...  Steve actually chose that as one of the better clips?  Yeah.  Don't blame Steve. 
[01:06:30]  I'm not blaming Steve at all.  All right, Danny.  Very good.  Well, I was going through clips.  All right, there you go.  The latest on the Hawks up on the Upper East Side there.  Oh, is that what that was?  Yeah.  And then we talk about shoes from Montana.  Oh, don't leave D-Jack, dude.  You did a good job.  You did a good job, Danny.  Oh, he didn't even wait to be dismissed.  He just slowly started walking out with his head down.  Because he should after that shoe diet rate.  He'd beat it.  This is a national radio show. 
[01:07:00]  Shoes.  And I just threw it in the garbage.  Oh.  Put an egg in your shoe and talk about it for half an hour.  You know what's funny?  All the other interns are just mocking him and laughing openly.  Oh, yeah.  Nathaniel's like, ha, ha, ha.  My appearance went great yesterday.  See, there is.  There's a whole hierarchy in there.  And they get on each other about their appearances.  Yeah, because there's like three or four very talented interns that work for the show.  And they're taking turns getting air time.  And every time they see one guy go into the studio for his air time, everyone else is 
[01:07:30]  hoping he fails miserably.  Right.  I know how that works.  I was in your shoes.  Because as soon as Danny left the studio, I see Nathaniel, who did the comedy tape yesterday.  And he's like.  He had a great appearance yesterday.  His head's down.  He's laughing because he knows how uncomfortable it was in there for Danny.  Danny did a good job.  Now Danny's shaking his head like he wants to kill himself.  Why?  Don't kill yourself.  Just listen to that clip again.  Yeah, Eric had his day in the sun running in front of the cameras yesterday.  Nathaniel did a great job with his stand-up comedy. 
[01:08:00]  And, you know, they kind of laughed at him a little bit.  Like Danny when he walked back in.  They were really happy about that shoes clip.  You could see him over there.  His head was starting to itch.  Right.  Let's go to Trucker Ray.  What's up, Trucker Ray?  Oh, not a whole lot this morning, guys.  But I got the perfect solution for them damn pauls.  All right.  Shoot their ass down and stuff them and put them in the lobby of that building.  Then everybody can see them.  Oh.  And look at them through a telescope.  Not a bad idea. 
[01:08:30]  You just want them stuffed.  Stuff them.  And that's the only way to go.  All right.  Thank you.  I'll see you.  Steve, what's going on?  I don't know.  Nathaniel just told me Ben wanted me in here.  Well, no.  You were talking about...  Tim was asking about how he selected the clips.  Yeah, about 40 minutes ago.  I know.  What the hell?  We're trying to get out of this.  No, I just wanted to know.  All right.  Well, now that you're here...  We're trying to get out of this awful bit.  No, that wasn't a bad bit.  I mean...  Good bit.  Yeah.  No, no.  It didn't go on too long at all.  I wanted to...  It was good. 
[01:09:00]  When you were selecting the clips, you chose the shoes clip.  Yeah, because...  Well, when Danny hands me this...  That goes every time, doesn't it?  Every time.  Shit.  I hate when you start talking and Ann forgets it.  I'm trying to look at it.  I know.  Sometimes I'm busy.  What happens when Danny goes out on the street and does these pieces, what he does is he hands  me these trimmed pieces of these time markers.  He time codes everything and he tells me what are the good clips. 
[01:09:30]  Because I've got a lot of stuff to do.  I just skim through it and grab what he thinks are good clips.  And, you know, I grab like six or seven.  Well, when there's a star next to it, I listen to it.  Eh, maybe.  When there's a star in a circle...  What?  Yeah, thank you.  What?  Anyway, Montana's shoes clip had big star, big circle around it, so...  What was the big star in the big circle, Danny?  What?  Danny's back.  Let me get on right here.  Basically, I mean, I time coded everything and I just put where the meat was, so to speak.  And I figured it would be up to Steve's discretion to pick and choose what he felt were the better 
[01:10:00]  clips.  But why the star in the circle, Dan?  What'd that mean?  Steve is showing.  It did have a star in a circle next to it.  Oh.  I don't know.  Were you saying that clip should play for the Cowboys?  Uh-oh.  Well, I mean, if it was garbage, then I figured it would have been filtered.  Steve, was it garbage?  Honestly, I didn't really understand it, but I threw it on there because...  Holy S!  I asked you before we did the bit.  I'm like, what do you think?  No, I told you.  I told you the last one.  I go, do you have confidence in this because we're about to play it? 
[01:10:30]  Did I say that, Ben?  You were here, right?  Yeah, you absolutely did.  I go, Steve.  Steve hands over the audio from Danny.  I go, well, Steve, you got confidence in this?  Because pretty much it goes through Steve, all the audio clips.  And you said, yeah, definitely.  Yeah, but I did warn you about that last one.  I did warn you about the last one.  And you said it's a little long, but it's kind of good.  Yeah, I did.  And it was like, eh.  You know, but the only thing is, it's just...  What?  Dude, we can't throw mediocre stuff on the show.  All right, then.  That's why I asked you. 
[01:11:00]  That's why I asked you.  Ed Norton.  That's why I asked you.  I go, do you have confidence in the material?  Honestly?  We all bomb our...  No, the first couple.  The first couple.  We all bomb on a regular basis.  And, you know, I don't know.  If you thought it wasn't that great, then that's fine.  Eh.  To be honest with you, I just know Danny worked really hard on it, so I didn't want to completely  toss out all the stuff.  Ah, there you go.  But it's, you know, I don't know.  Dude, yeah, but...  No, I understand.  I understand your point.  You can't throw, like, crap on the show because you don't want to hurt someone's feelings. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  Did you not like all of them or just that last one?  Out of the six clips...  The first one was very good.  I liked the first one.  Out of the six clips, probably two were good.  Two were good?  All right.  Next time.  The guy does good work.  He could handle it if you say, you know, this isn't, uh, we're playing on the air.  I'll use a lot more discretion next time.  You didn't want to hurt his feelings, so you made all of us sweat in front of him as we're  looking at Danny going, when does this get good?  That's right.  The whole country just hurt his feelings, Steve.  So you didn't want to hurt his feelings, but we had to be all uncomfortable in here as  we're playing the stuff.  All right. 
[01:12:00]  I apologize.  I will.  I will.  I will.  I asked him.  I go, Steve, do you have confidence in this?  Is this good?  Because if not, we'll just, you know, we'll just not play it.  All right.  I will.  I will be a lot more.  We'll have to be a little harsher.  That's right.  I will be a lot harsher in the future.  You brought it in like it was Woody Allen's moose bit.  I did not do that.  You weren't even in the goddamn room when I brought it in.  He's just like, he's under the bus.  Throw him more.  Oh, of course.  That's his job.  I know.  He's just like, he's like Lee Harvey Oswald.  It's just, you know, picking him off.  Oswald didn't do anything. 
[01:12:30]  Of course not.  I'm not going to stop and get a Coke.  Marty on the phone says, that bit just crashed and steved.  Oh, jeez.  No, it was all right.  When the whole shoot, like when you were talking to the guy from Montana, I liked that clip.  When you were talking to the guy from out of town, the guys were kind of like riffing.  That was cool.  Yeah, riffing.  Not quite.  Cassie.  What's up, Cassie?  Hey, you guys need to quit picking on Danny there, man.  He got a response out of that guy out of Montana.  The guy played with him.  So, you enjoyed the Montana guy talking about the people that make their own shoes? 
[01:13:00]  It was a little bit funny.  I mean, it wasn't hilarious, but you know, he got to play with him.  What part of it was a little funny, miss?  If you could go back, if you don't mind refreshing our memories.  Just the fact that the guy from Montana was responding to the shoe thing.  You know, he...  Exactly.  Mind your business.  Don't interfere with what goes on in this show.  Pardon me?  You heard me, stupid.  Don't interfere when men are talking about what's funny on a show. 
[01:13:30]  I'm going to fucking do that.  One more thing, man.  You guys need to get a thing where these guys are going by flashing women, too.  You want guys to flash the women on the highways?  Yeah, because we're perverts, too.  You are.  You're a trucker.  You get action out there on the highway?  Yeah, I watch some guy...  Well, I'm married, so...  But, you know, I was watching some guy playing with himself going down the road yesterday 
[01:14:00]  in Alabama.  Oh, really?  The driving jack.  Yeah, I wanted to ask the truckers about that.  Do you guys get to see a lot of that when you're up high?  Oh, yeah.  You get to see everything.  Pretty little seat cover.  So, what?  He was just cranking it as he's tooling down the highway?  Yeah, and he went by me, so I blew my air horn at him, and he slowed down and let me watch.  Oh, man.  I thought it was funny.  I was laughing at him.  He was whacking his bag?  Yeah.  Yeah, he was whacking his bag, and she's taking a look from above. 
[01:14:30]  And that's not the response us guys are looking for, you know, you to laugh at us.  You're supposed to say, yeah, that was really hot now.  Not, yeah, it was funny.  You're supposed to keep your dick in your pants when you're driving.  Yeah, well, I know that.  But, you know, when you're not that big, you're going to laugh at him.  Do you have a little mule, miss?  Oh, yeah.  How about if it was a big one?  Would you have gotten out and gotten in the car with him?  No, I'm married, man.  Oh, that doesn't sound most people. 
[01:15:00]  Who are you kidding?  Well, my husband's with me, so, you know.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  Ixnay on the cheating egg.  All right.  Thank you, Kathy.  All right, guys.  Have a good one, man.  All right, you guys have a good trip.  Let's go to Jake in Jersey.  Jake, what's up?  Hey, man, I was just going to say, you know, don't be so harsh on Danny.  You know, Nathaniel's comedy up today was kind of a little bit lacking.  Nathaniel, Nathaniel's comedy was good.  He's only doing it six months, and I liked where he went with a lot of the material. 
[01:15:30]  For six months, he's really good, man.  I don't know.  I wasn't feeling it.  I'm down with the little Norton there, boo-boo.  Dude, I'm doing it 15 years, though.  It's like when you see guys, I see enough new guys to, like, when someone's doing it six months  and already their material is that well-written and that well-thought-out, they're going to be really good.  You've got to look at how long someone's in the game.  And six months was some very funny stuff.  All right.  I was just trying to cheer Danny up a little there.  I'm sorry.  I'm out.  All right.  Danny might be bashing Nathaniel.  You know what he's going to do to drag Nathaniel into that quagmire that Danny created while 
[01:16:00]  chatting with some idiot about shoes?  Steve hung us out to dry, though.  Oh, boy, did he?  It's Steve's fault.  It sure is.  I like how the second you took that phone call, they both slinked out of here.  They certainly did.  Yeah, they were done.  Steve is just smoldering now.  He's not even on fire.  He's just like a smoldering black cloud.  Smoldering mess.  Humiliated smoke.  Someone's got to walk up to him and go, Anthony, promotion.  Get him started again.  Promotion side, sorry.  Good morning, boys.  How are you?  Good.  What's up?  Listen, don't blame Danny. 
[01:16:30]  The guy busted his home for the bit.  Blame that awful, blazing inferno for letting the clip get through onto the show.  Yeah, Steve's got to make the decision if it's good enough for the air or not.  I agree.  He just didn't want to hurt Danny's feelings.  I agree, but the public has to realize, too, when you're watching a network TV show and  the show is terrible, do you go, God damn it, this executive producer?  No, you go, look at these actors.  They stink.  You have to blame the performer.  That's true.  The best thing he could offer, oh, there was a star in a circle next to it. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, Steve had nothing.  I like how he was stammering.  Oh, what a ninny he was.  You knew Steve was finished when he first walked in.  He goes, well, I'm very busy.  All right, very good.  John in the city.  What's up, John?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  How did that woman see this guy jacking off?  She's looking at the roof of his car.  Well, maybe he's got the sunroof. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, Timmy Technical.  Maybe he's over and you can see through the passenger side window.  Yeah, he's jacking off.  Why?  Do you need some pointers on how to see guys jacking it while they're driving their pal?  No, but it just doesn't make any sense that he doesn't have a sunroof.  She didn't say anything about a sunroof.  Well, maybe she didn't need to give all the details.  The truckers have talked about this for years.  They could see people whacking it.  You could see through the passenger side window.  That is just so weird.  Not that high up.  Sir, when you watch pornography and you're jerking off, do you kind of like get turned off 
[01:18:00]  because you're like, why would she break down right in front of his house?  That would never happen.  I would never jerk off in the car.  Maybe you wouldn't in the car.  No headroom.  That old gag.  That ain't even going to save you.  I'll punch it out.  He tried to save his awful joke with that old gag.  That's not that old gag.  A lot of jet aircraft go down on this show.  I know.  Their pilots slowly coming down behind it in the parachute.  This is like a 20-car pileup on the highway all of a sudden. 
[01:18:30]  It started with a cute little bit and now there's just wreckage everywhere.  There's a lot of fog up ahead, guys.  Slow down.  They just keep piling into the ass end of it.  And the worst part on that call was that guy actually ran that joke by Steve.  Guys will like it.  I didn't want to hurt his feelings.  Well, I thought it was all right.  It's a touchy-feely show.  Yeah, let us suffer because you don't have the balls to tell the kid his stuff stunk today. 
[01:19:00]  It wasn't bad, actually.  Chris from Houston.  What's up?  Hey, y'all talked to some moron from Montana.  What'd you expect?  What's wrong with Montana?  Oh, come on.  Ain't y'all ever been there?  Hell no.  There you go.  Just a bunch of jack-off.  See y'all later, man.  All right.  Wow.  Another car hit the back of the car.  Another car right there.  Oh, jeez.  We're just looking for one car to miss the wreckage here. 
[01:19:30]  He tried to skid, but...  Jason from New Hampshire.  What's up?  What's up, guys?  You know, the guy's wondering how the lady saw him whacking his bag.  Yeah.  You can see everything.  Why?  You're a trucker?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Of course you can see, right?  Yeah, you can see.  I broke my leg back in May.  I missed skirt season.  I was bummed.  What?  You see a lot of women's coochies when you're up above there?  You try like hell.  The short skirts?  Oh, yeah.  You take a look back. 
[01:20:00]  It's a lot easier, though.  Is it easier when you're, like, in a two-lane small road and, like, bumper-to-bumper traffic  if they're coming one way and you're going this way?  Because if you're driving and they're driving, how do you look down and see up their skirt  when you're in the pass driver's seat or in the driver's seat?  Up their skirt, it'd be pretty hard.  Do you see a lot of girls playing with themselves?  I saw one.  And I was going up 89 in New Hampshire, and I was going at it with a dildo.  It was great.  With a dildo.  And how fast was she going?  She was doing regular highway speeds.  I'm talking about how fast was the dildo. 
[01:20:30]  So was she?  Yeah.  No, you don't.  That's great.  What exit did she get off?  I think she was getting off the whole way.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  Another one, Anthony?  He almost made it, though.  He almost made it around the...  Got distracted at the end, though.  He tried to swerve, and he got cocky.  Oh, I made it through.  Andy from Florida, what's up?  Hey, man.  How are you guys doing today?  Good.  Hey, yeah, that other guy just called and said you can't see shit. 
[01:21:00]  Man, you can see everything.  I mean, when a car is just coming up to your driver's door and a girl,  like the other guy, says skirt season.  Yeah, she got that left leg kicked up.  Yeah, you can see it.  Yeah.  You can see everything.  Have you watched girls doing it on the highway?  Oh, yeah.  The one I most remember, I was coming down 77 in North Carolina,  and this girl, she had her skirt hiked up.  It was at nighttime, and she had her skirt hiked up with her dome light on 
[01:21:30]  playing with that booger, man.  I mean, you see all kinds of shit.  It's pretty wild.  But also, I'd like to thank you guys for that free play last week.  I jumped on board on Saturday evening, so I like it.  I love it, man.  Thank you.  I'll call, man.  Thanks.  We greatly appreciate it.  All right, guys.  We'll talk to you later.  Take care of yourself.  Bye.  All right.  Let's go to Todd the Trucker.  Todd, what's up?  Morning, guys.  How are you doing?  Pretty good.  Morning, sunshine.  Good morning, Angel.  Hey, Jimmy.  I think you're a great comedian, and I love your stuff,  but you've got to back off of this kid. 
[01:22:00]  He was out there doing his thing, and you're really riding him this morning  and giving him a hard time, and all this is coming from the guy  who could not get his picture taken with De Niro.  Sir, that's the beauty of it.  I know I'm an ass.  We're teaching Danny that he is.  We like Danny, sir, but if I bomb, I acknowledge it,  and he didn't care.  Danny's not broken up over it.  He's fine.  Okay.  Well, you guys made it sound like he was crying.  Look, in fairness to Danny, all right, in fairness to Danny,  if you want to see Danny, check him out December 23rd. 
[01:22:30]  He'll be at the downtown of Long Island.  Oh, that's a plug for you.  You can see Danny at 516-293-7700.  Danny will be doing the unedited version of the Montana Shubit.  How can you see him at a phone number?  Well, at the downtown.  He said you could call for reservations.  He said you could see him at and then gave him a phone number.  There goes Jimmy Norton.  Oh, I didn't even have my belt on either.  My little fat face in the windshield.  Dwayne the Trucker.  What's up, Dwayne?  Hey, what's going on, shit dicks? 
[01:23:00]  No, no, no.  Calm down with that.  Don't make me play that song again.  I love the shit dicks.  No, no, no, no.  You don't have the guts to play that song again.  I don't even know where it is today.  There's so much crap around here.  Ben, Ope's looking for something.  Go ahead, Dwayne.  What's up?  I just wanted to verify to everybody.  I'm a trucker myself, and yes, we see everything that goes on.  You notice when you're pulling up beside the truck driver and you look up, and he's always  looking down.  That's because we're always trying to see what's going on down there. 
[01:23:30]  If there's a female.  Well, in summertime, we're always looking for short skirts.  You can tell if they're not wearing any panties or anything.  Oh, man.  This is kind of hot, Anthony.  Anthony!  No, this is hot!  What are you doing?  Dwayne!  Dude!  He's talking about BJs and chicks masturbating.  What are you doing?  Oh, yeah.  Shoot.  I've seen, shoot, every year, once or twice in the summertime, I'll see a girl going down 
[01:24:00]  on her man while he's driving.  Roadhead.  There you go.  All right.  All right.  There you go.  Well, thank you, Dwayne.  All right.  No problem.  All right.  One more, and we've got to move on here.  Mike, the trucker, what's up?  Hey, guys.  You can see everything out of those 18-wheelers.  I guarantee it.  I've seen two college chicks going down the highway, got flashed by one of them.  I saw a chick giving another guy a hand job. 
[01:24:30]  What a handy.  It was 6.30 in the morning.  I've seen a blow job going on a rest area in a parked car.  You can see it all, and I like it when you watch them.  Some do, right?  Oh, that makes the job worthwhile.  Now, how often does it happen when you're on the road?  I've been in it three years, and I've seen all that.  Oh, and you've seen it what?  I've been in the business three years now, and I've seen all of what I've just told you  in three years.  I know, but how often?  Once a week?  Once a run? 
[01:25:00]  Once a month?  That depends how many miles you put on.  I put on about 2,000 miles a week.  You see something about once a month.  Wow.  Very good.  And that guy, Kathy, she's lying.  She wasn't laughing.  She's probably salivating like Pavlov's dog.  That's what I'm thinking, but I think her husband was sitting right next to her.  I'm punching out before I hit the crash, man.  All right.  I got to say, the truckers are definitely keeping their calls a lot shorter lately.  Man, we appreciate that on the show.  They know now.  Glenn on Long Island, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good. 
[01:25:30]  Great to have you back.  Thanks, Glenn.  Listen, I've been driving.  I drive for a living, and I saw a lot of stuff out there on the road.  But the latest thing I saw was someone giving head to somebody going through the Midtown Tunnel.  Oh, wow.  That's pretty treacherous.  Yeah, man.  Those cones they put up in there, the dividers they got in there now, makes it a little tight  if you're driving kind of a big vehicle.  Yeah, you got what?  Maybe a foot on each side?  I was driving the van, watching them do it all the way through. 
[01:26:00]  When we got to the other side, I got out and gave them a fucking standing ovation.  Do they mind?  The girl got up and stood up, man.  She was fucking a trooper.  She stood up in the car, did she?  She got out of the car.  She was a fucking trooper.  Really?  On the other side of the tunnel, she got out of the car?  On the other side of the tunnel, she was a fucking trooper.  I'll say.  She stood up and took a bow.  Was she a trooper?  I kind of like that.  I don't know.  All right, you guys can help me.  All right, Glenn.  Thank you.  Punch it out, Maverick. 
[01:26:30]  All right.  One more.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing there?  Good.  What's going on?  Hi, Mr. Norton.  Hi, Dan.  Thanks for calling the program.  Hey, you guys can see everything through the front windshield.  Yeah.  Oh, that's true.  Right at the front.  Right at the skirt, man.  Yeah, I can see how that could happen.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  But especially if you're coming the opposite way they are, and it's really slow, bumper-to-bumper  traffic, where you can peek down in there and give it a good look.  Take a good look-see.  And Ryan the Trucker.  What's up, Ryan? 
[01:27:00]  Hey, man.  What's going on?  Hey.  This has become a hot topic, Anthony.  It's a hot topic on the O&A show.  Long-time caller, or long-time listener, first-time caller.  Why, welcome to the program.  Wah, wah.  Wah.  Oh.  I thought I'd just come off the George Washington Bridge.  Washington.  Wait.  George.  Oh, wait.  What?  Could you say that again?  I said I'd just come off the George Washington Bridge.  Washington.  Yeah, I'm from West Virginia.  Wait.  And how do you say that? 
[01:27:30]  Washington.  Where does that R come from?  Oh, hell, man.  I don't know.  Shit.  We all talk like that.  I don't know.  Yeah.  That dumb accent starts in Philly, where they'll go, like, Chicago.  Like, Keith Robinson would say Chicago.  They start to put the R.  Yeah.  Chicago.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow.  It all starts in Philly.  I just come off the George Washington Bridge, and I've just seen a woman fingering herself.  Fingering herself on the bridge?  On what bridge?  Well, it's off the George Washington Bridge. 
[01:28:00]  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  Down at the toll booth.  Wow.  I've never heard Washington.  How would you say it normally?  Yeah.  Well, I usually say Washington.  We're a bunch of dumbass hillbillies in West Virginia.  That's money.  It's just the stupidest things that make us laugh on this show.  You're adding an R into a historic name.  Yeah.  So let me ask you, how did you feel about the Crenody assassination?  The Crenody. 
[01:28:30]  Man, you guys rock.  I listen to you every morning.  Well, all right, man.  Thank you, Ryan.  Yeah, we'd like to talk.  I'm watching the news.  I want to see what's going on with Bin Laden.  Hey, I'm bunching out, guys.  All right, there he goes, Ryan.  Worshing.  Worshing.  The hell is that?  The laugh of the day right there.  They said that.  I got to go do the worsh.  Do the worsh.  Worsh.  Go worsh your hands.  You guys, this is a hot topic.  You want to continue or not? 
[01:29:00]  I'll say.  Yeah?  All right, let's say how to Bob.  Bob, what's up?  Hey, yeah, this is Bob, the trucker from Tennessee.  Okay.  I'm coming through Chicago one late Sunday evening and coming in traffic there, and I looked  by the side of me there, and I could see his ass sticking up in the passenger side door  there.  And this girl was going to town on this guy going up the traffic there.  Sucking on it, eh?  Oh, man.  And we were passing back and forth there in slow traffic, and after about five minutes, 
[01:29:30]  I could see her getting up, wiping her mouth.  And they like to be watched, huh?  Oh, hell yeah.  The guy had this big smile on his face.  Of course he did.  Hey, Bob, where are you from?  I'm from Tennessee.  Tennessee?  Who was the first president of the United States?  George Washington.  Yeah, that was kind of like a New Orleans type vibe.  George Washington.  You have me consorting with a cast of presidents.  All right.  Thank you, buddy. 
[01:30:00]  Appreciate it, buddy.  You know what's funny about these?  They almost sound like they could be UFO sightings.  I was on Highway 79 going through.  All of a sudden, all of a sudden, I started getting this weird feeling in me, you know?  And this light done shined down on my truck.  And the engine stopped, and I had to get out.  And lo and behold, I just started levitating up to the object.  And as I looked in the window, I seen these aliens, you know, with the big eyes, the gray skin,  and they got that no hair. 
[01:30:30]  And then all of a sudden, one of them is sucking the other one's dick.  So that's what I saw that day.  Then I got the anal probe.  I was driving my truck down there, and right about over to George Washington Bridge.  And I got abducted by the alien, and they gave me an anal probe.  And that alien never even worsted his hands when he was done with putting his finger in my butt.  Worsh. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, my God.  I love it.  There's your seven cents for today, by the way.  Seven cents a day.  If you didn't enjoy George Worshing.  I was listening to one of the replays, and that goddamn, that dumb voice when he said Worcester, Massachusetts.  Worcester.  I don't know why it's so funny to hear somebody dumbly mispronounce something, but it's never not funny.  Hi, Bonnie.  Yeah, I'm stuck in Worcester.  I'm going to be here a while, poopsie cake, and I miss you. 
[01:31:30]  Something terrible.  Yeah.  No, I'll Worcester behind my ear.  I know it stinks like garbage.  Worcester.  Worcester.  I'm trying to get an audio of that.  I am, too.  I can't find it again, and I just watched it this past week.  I went to Bob's yesterday.  It was on HBO On Demand, but it's not there anymore.  I wanted to run a tape of that awful.  Just get that audio of her going, oh, with her little hand and her floating thumb. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, it's just worthless.  She has to pick everything up with her two forefingers.  Not only does she have those little sausage, Vienna sausage, fat little fingers, and that  puffy muffin paw hand, but her thumb doesn't work.  It's fused, and it flops around like a party favor.  It just, it goes, like it's rubber, when she goes, ooooh. 
[01:32:30]  Don't you want to bite her?  I want to just take her whole hand and just sink my teeth into it.  It's a bitable little fat hand.  It's so puffy and airy.  It's like a souffle hand.  So light and airy and flaky.  Right, it really should be on a Dunkin' Donuts rack.  Full of jelly.  Two chocolates and one of those.  Ooh, the midget finger.  I'd love one of those.  Dunkin' midget hand.  Big, just puffy thing. 
[01:33:00]  All sweetness covered in powdered sugar.  You called it a Kaiser roll, didn't I say that was really?  Oh, just a Kaiser roll.  Little caraway seeds on it.  Puffy.  Those little nails that are barely existent.  Ugh.  That's just awful.  How do you shake that?  Pleasure to meet you?  No, it isn't.  Get that disgusting excuse for a mitt out of my hand.  Little thing.  She looked like, and she was so compressed, like it's just a chore to walk. 
[01:33:30]  They're like, hey, hire that.  They can't even, what, their necks are turned backwards.  Like they were putting a little can crusher, you know, and it just, like, crushed down a little bit.  Oh, midgets.  Do you see the baby without the face?  The little girl boy.  Oh, man.  Someone sent me that goddamn video.  Is it Eric?  I can't watch stuff like that.  Like I said, give me all the smut in the world, and I'll watch every bit of it.  But the gross stuff, I cannot handle.  And this one, I mean, the poor parents of this thing, they're showing the father holding this baby and looking into its, I can't say face. 
[01:34:00]  Orbs.  Into its orbs.  Does it have eyes?  Kind of.  It's like a cartoon character.  Do the eyes work?  No, they're all over the place.  I can't even see them as eyes.  So what do you mean no face?  I haven't seen this yet.  Picture if you laid a baby on the ground and took a spade shovel and took a divot out of it.  Like, you know how you take that first spade shovel full of dirt? 
[01:34:30]  You put the shovel and then you stomp it with your hand and pull out that big notch of soil?  That's what it looked like you did to a baby's face.  Just threw it away.  And you see sinuses and meat and ligament.  And the mouth is open and it's like you see the big tongue lolling in the front.  Tongue and teeth.  It's got no upper jaw pieces.  No nose.  No eyebrow thing. 
[01:35:00]  It's just as if you had ripped away everything that makes a human face.  Can we get a picture of that?  Are they going to get the Mr. Potato Head parts?  Snap on face?  Yeah, remember that guy from that other documentary?  Guy had a snap on nose.  Snap on nose that is more than a nose.  He had a hole in the middle of his, not an entire face.  It went from below his eyes and I think it covered his whole mouth.  To his cheeks and then down.  Yeah.  And he had this snap on piece that snapped on to his face.  Snapped on to give him a nose and like a mouth and stuff. 
[01:35:30]  When you're that deformed and you're being born, and again, I'm not trying to even be funny.  Is there a point?  It's like should you as a parent, it's hard to say.  Like you're supposed to love your kid, but because the kid is like pretty much can't breathe properly.  Like has a lot of health problems as well.  It's not just like unpleasant to look at.  So you're almost better off not being, I don't want to say it, but you're almost better off not being, you know.  I think that would show up in a sonogram early enough where they could, because I've seen profiles of kids in a sonogram, you know.  And it's like, okay, you know, you can see the face and everything. 
[01:36:00]  If that's showing up in a sonogram where you just look and go, ooh.  Ooh, maybe you've got to go to the clinic, have that taken care of.  Just because it's going to happen.  It's not like someone's born short or whatever, they can have a normal or happy life despite being laughed at and kind of kicked.  But when you're that deformed, you can't breathe properly.  What are you going to do?  You're going to depend on people for the rest of your life.  And you're going to scare all of us.  Horrifying.  The eyes are like bugged out.  It's a monster.  It's a real, live monster. 
[01:36:30]  Where can we find that?  Steve's got a picture of someone along.  Yeah, Steve's got it.  Is it up on Foundry Music?  It is really gruesome.  Steve's running back in here.  Might be on Drudge still.  It's up on FoundryMusic.com and OpenAnthony.com.  I saw a show on Discovery Health.  Yeah.  How do they find it, though?  How do they find?  Like this picture.  Is it very obvious?  Is it one of the headlines?  No, it's one of the headlines.  We'll relink it.  What Nathaniel's doing is he's getting a still shot of the video so he can show you, because it's only a video clip.  All right, cool.  Let's go to Father Trucker real fast. 
[01:37:00]  Father Trucker, what's up?  I just wanted to call in and contradict all these other truckers.  We don't see that much bullshit out here on the road.  I've been out here a long time, and the most I've seen out here is ladies feeding their kids.  Nice big titty hanging out and baby latched on.  That's about the most exciting thing we get to see.  Wait, breastfeeding while they're driving down the highway?  No, the passenger.  Oh, okay.  And the guy's driving or whatever.  Yeah, but, you know, truck drivers are full of shit. 
[01:37:30]  We're a good bunch of people, but we're full of shit.  All right.  Thank you, Father Trucker.  All right, man.  Have a good one, man.  All right.  Speaking of that, we'll talk about that next.  All right, Ant?  Fuckers are just disgusting.  We have a Lacey Peterson song that is just horrific.  Oh, my God.  We're going to play that next.  We'll talk about this.  Is it a parody, O, or a regular song?  It's a parody.  You haven't heard this one yet.  Okay.  Anthony and I heard it. 
[01:38:00]  You're going to just, you're going to come.  Knowing you, you're just going to have to.  Why?  Did you just say Opie over and over again?  Jesus.  Oh, do we have to see that red-headed whore from Peterson?  Yeah, let's take a break, because I've got to take a leak.  Shut up.  You know, she got her hair done, though.  Oh, of course.  She got her hair done.  She's a big star now.  Now she's a big star.  We'll talk about the Peterson thing, all right?  We'll clear the phone lines.  No midget sightings for now, because we've got a lot of things to do. 
[01:38:30]  Tommy Chong coming in a little later on.  Are we going to try to do Stoner Spelling Bee?  Anyone calling?  Yeah, sure.  Calling all potheads.  Yeah, calling all potheads.  Yeah, potheads, Colin.  If you want to smoke a lot of pot on the show today, give us a call.  I don't know.  We might have something cool to give away to the winner, too, okay?  In the meantime, it's Brother Joe, and I think this version of Police Got My Car  will work for everybody out there in Satellite Radio Land.  Check it out.  Hey, man, you want to go out and get a beer and burn one or something?  I can't, man. 
[01:39:00]  The police, they got my car.  What do you mean the police got your car?  Just what I said.  The police got my car.  The police got your car?  You stupid ass, the police, they got my car.  Dude, I can't believe the police got your car.  Ah, shut up, man.  The police got my car.  The police got my car while I was driving home from the bar.  Dude, that really sucks.  Son of a bitch, I want my Chevy for Christmas.

I want my friggin' 60 Chevy for Christmas.  You stupid dick, I want my Chevy for Christmas, so I can go get drunk at the bar. 
[01:40:00]  Police got my car  Police got my car  Police got my car  While I was driving getting stoned in South Central  Dude, that don't rhyme  Shut up, man  Police got my car  The police got my car  The police got your car?  Police got my car  While I was driving home drunk from the bar 
[01:40:30]  You got a tee-wee, man  You stupid dick, I want my Chevy for Christmas  I want my friggin' 60 Chevy for Christmas  I told my bitch I'd have my Chevy for Christmas  So we could get drunk at the bar  You stupid dick, I want my Chevy for Christmas  I want my friggin' 60 Chevy for Christmas  I told my bitch I'd have my Chevy for Christmas  So we could go get drunk at the bar  Calm down, man  Ah, shut up, man

[01:43:30]  Around the five minute mark in the first half against Kentucky  Just trying to get a rotation going  That I can feel comfortable about  Going into conference play  The Hoosiers return to action on Sunday afternoon  When they travel to Mizzou  To play the Tigers  Missouri has a record of 5-4  IRO, ranked 17th by AP  And 24th on the Coaches Bowl  Is 8-1  And just one game behind Illinois 
[01:44:00]  The top team in the nation  The Hawkeyes also have the week off in finals  Coach Steve Alford said  He's pretty pleased with the efforts so far  We've been through a very difficult stretch  Of nine games in 22 days  So I'm very pleased with what our team's been able to accomplish  In that period  And we're in finals right now  So to have a week here  Where we get some practice in  And not be playing a lot of games  About every third day  Hopefully we can improve on some things  That we need to improve on  But through this difficult nine game stretch 
[01:44:30]  To get eight wins  We're pretty pleased to this point  Next up for the Hawkeyes  The Western Carolina Catamounts  In Callowee, North Carolina  Saturday evening  And that's the Big Ten today  On XM Satellite Radio  Big Ten!  Big Ten!  It's everything  24-7  XM  202  The O&A virus  It's everything  All the time  XM 202 
[01:45:00]  The O.B. and Anthony Show  I don't know what's worth fighting for  Why do I have to scream  I don't know why I instigate  Say what I don't mean  I don't know how I got this way  I know it's not alright  So I'm breaking  We don't like this one  No, what is that?  Lincoln Park  Yeah, it doesn't sound like Lincoln Park  It doesn't really sound like Lincoln Park 
[01:45:30]  Sounds like some kind of  New Wave 80s thing  Like 80s  I don't like that at all  That's awful  It's the O&A virus spreading across America  Thanks for checking out the show today  We appreciate it  Really fast  Boston checking in  Boston very pissed off today  What does Boston have to be pissed off about?  Their cats are kicking ass  Their socks are still  I believe they're still  World champions  World champions  I like how we talk about these cities 
[01:46:00]  Like they're a person  Boston very pissed off today  Yes  A big F you goes out to Pedro Martinez  Fuck you Pedro  Take your fucking money  And run faggot  Hope you're happy pitching  For a fourth place team  At least you have your  Fucking respect, right?  Go fuck yourself  Wow  Boston people are very pissed off  Because Pedro's about to sign  With the New York Mets  Looks like he's going to be a Met  Ben is hysterical  He's past his prime  Yeah, exactly  Oh yeah  You guys picked up  David Wells yesterday  He's a 41 year old pitcher  And you got rid of Pedro 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, that's a great way  To take care of your pitching  And you're going to lose Manny  They're going to lose Manny too  That's what Boston fans do  And that's what Ben does  He says  Oh, he's past his prime  If he would have stayed  With the Sox  Well, see  We hung on to him  He's a great guy  Great guy  It's in Theo we trust  Every move Theo Epstein has made  Has been a good move  So this, you know  It was a lot of money too  Let Opie have his one day in the sun  The Mets get one good pitcher  All the Met fans too  On the local news  Are all pissed off  What he's making though  Is that Boston  Is like already letting 
[01:47:00]  What a big stable  Their championship team is  At least the Yankees  Kept them together  For X amount of years  Boston's letting them go already  And replacing them with Wells  Who I like  But Pedro  Yeah, but Pedro  Pedro's a lot of money  We'll see what happens  With the Manny  They won the first championship  In 80 years  What are they going to spend  An extra 10 million on Pedro  It's like  They just finally won  And they're worried  About 10 million  You can't let Pedro go  And then pick up David Wells  That's just awful  They'll get someone else  Not even a knock on Wells  But you don't trade  Pedro for Wells  No, it is  Because Wells is 41 years old 
[01:47:30]  His best days are way behind him  How old's Pedro?  Not 41  I don't know  He was mid-30s  33 maybe  34, right?  Yeah, it's a bad move  To let him go  Yeah, whatever  It's just a stupid move  You've got to hold on to Pedro  Because Curt Schilling's  Getting way up there now too  Don't forget someone else  Schilling's like 38 maybe  Where's the magical pitching  Coming from?  They'll get someone else  No one spends more  Than Steinbrenner, man  Nobody spends more  Than Steinbrenner  And that Curt Schilling  That steroid-driven team  I hope he dies  I hope it's on the eve  Of some type of a family event 
[01:48:00]  And they all can't wait  To see him  And he just drops dead  He does nothing  But hurt my team  Yes, he does  What about steroid boy  Giambi and Sheffield  And Sheffield?  Did you get rid of Sheffield?  I don't think Sheffield did steroids  Yeah, he did  Come on  Of course he did  He didn't admit that  He did  Maybe he didn't know  He was doing it  Like Barry Bonds  I'll say this about Sheffield  Sheffield produced  I don't care  Exactly  He produced  That's why you Yankee  You Yankee fans  Don't throw him under the bus  Everybody is  I don't care if you  Look, I gotta rape a baby 
[01:48:30]  Real quick  Then go hit a home run  Go ahead  Knock yourself out, Gary  Plus his wife is getting laid  You gotta love Gary Sheffield  She's eating a box  Banging R. Kelly  Holding the kid down  While R. Kelly  Tinkles on her  How do you not love Sheffield?  Yeah, Sheffield is  Norton's hero  No, I never liked Giambi  Only because what we gave up  To get him  I liked Nick Johnson  Nick Johnson  Looked like he had  Down syndrome  And he had high socks  And he had a high on base percentage  And I didn't want some  Big dumb slugger  But Sheffield did the job  I never liked Giambi  Never liked him  Alright, let's move on  Sorry  It's not even baseball season  It's just a quick thing 
[01:49:00]  That's in the paper  You wanna watch the World Series  Do ya?  Hey, ask Scanlon  Who's pitching the opener?  Ken in California  What's up, Ken?  It's Tim  What?  It's Tim  T-I-M  Hi, Tim  Well, you're Ken today, asshole  Okay, I'm Ken  Ken's got some bitchin' to do  Why?  Go ahead  I gotta pay $2  On top of my fuckin' subscription  For the XM  To hear fuckin' commercials  When you guys go to break 
[01:49:30]  What commercials are they  Playin' these days?  They're playin' like  Commercials for other XM channels  Like, I got XM  I know what the fuck's on there  Dude, we have  You have to understand  We have very few commercials  And we have to have some  Cause we have to take  Some kind of break  During the hour  We can't just talk  Play some music  Play some music  Don't let them make you  Force you play that shit  Play some music  Play some, like  Skits or something  I gotta listen to that shit  Alright, we barely  And pay $2 off altogether  I agree with you  We barely go to break  These days  So, we go maybe  Once every 45 minutes 
[01:50:00]  We used to go once  Every half hour  But don't mention  The $2, dude  It doesn't help  The argument  To say I'm spending $2  And then poke your finger  On the table  Just say it annoys me  When I hear commercials  $2  Yes, not one  Not two  He makes a good point  Though, you know  With my XM Satellite Radio  I know exactly  Thank you, Tim  Bye, Tim  Bye, Ken  You know, most people  That have XM Satellite Radio 
[01:50:30]  You know exactly  What's on the channels  Right  You know, maybe  You don't know  The specific programs  That they're running  On some of the channels  At times  But that's why  You go to the website  Or something, you know  Is it kind of a reminder  Like, oh, I would like  To hear that  I forgot it was available  I guess  But I know where  All the channels are  They're preaching  To the converted  Exactly  I don't mind them  Playing promos  Because they play  Opie and Anthony  Promos on other channels  It's fine a little promo  To get some cross-promotion  But just stop it  That we're one of  130 channels  To use Elo's  Little analogy of a mall  You have a couple  Of anchor stores 
[01:51:00]  In the mall  And I'm sorry  But cards and stuff  Doesn't get the same  Attention as Nordstrom  Or Sears  Very good  You don't get the same  Square footage  You don't get the same  Volume  The quality of employee  Exactly  Your four douchebags  In cards and stuff  Or the monster  That is anchoring  Your store  What channel  Would be the cart  That sells the crappy  Jewelry  In the middle of the  The hallway  Absolutely  That would be  The boneyard  You know the cart 
[01:51:30]  That they just  Wheel out for Christmas  Yeah  That's sitting there  Full of crap  And the nerve of me  By the way  To imply that this show  Is anchoring the whole network  But we just showed up  In October  And they're still  Almost at 3 million  Are we Nordstrom  Or Sears  I don't know  Macy's  We're like  We're Bradley's  Right now  Nah we're kind of like  Bullocks  I think we're kind of like  Spencer's Gifts  Spencer Gifts  What a useless  Fucking store that is  There's a few good things  In the store  Every once in a while  A few good bits  That's like what this show  Is all about  That store was cool 
[01:52:00]  When I was 18  It's one of those stores  Where you just  You walk in it  There's nothing  You need in there  Nothing you need  You don't buy gag gifts  Oh  The little goofy  Hey I got this for you  Look at that  It's a card  And it's got a big  Pop-up penis in it  It says  Happy birthday  You prick  Where are  I care  Oh no  No  What  Oh my god  I almost said  What 
[01:52:30]  You buy this little box  It opens up  And it sounds like  A baby fry  Oh my god  Here we go  We're going  We're going back  To that again  I let it go  Chris from Maine  What's up  Hey what's going on  First of all  It's so nice  To hear you guys  In the air  Oh thank you  Sure is  Well I was a big fan  Of yours  I had to drive  All the way to New York  To hear you before  Oh cool  Hey just a silly question  Why are you doing it  Starting at 6  Instead of like  Toontime at 1 o'clock 
[01:53:00]  Like before  Well no  We're on at 3  Well it doesn't matter  I mean the show  Pretty much runs  All day long  On this channel  So  No I think it does matter  Because you know  A lot of your guests  Were more awake  And more alive  In the middle of the day  Than in the morning  The main reason  Is because  Being on the entire country  I mean people say  Well what about  The other morning guys  A lot of these places  Don't have a morning guy  So we're on as many times  As you can possibly be on  Yeah this is a national  Radio show now bro  We can't make believe  We can't make believe  We're just big on the east coast 
[01:53:30]  There's people in California  And you can't give people  A show that's a day old  You can't  If we start at 3 o'clock  On the east coast  That's like  You know let's say  Yeah it's noon  In California  That means their morning show  Would be the show  From the day before  You just can't do that  When it's a national platform  Is that what you're doing now  I mean if you start  No not at all  No the show is live  6 to 10  In New York  And then repeats  In morning drive  For the west coasters  But in order for them  To call in live  They'd have to call in at what  3 a.m.?  That is true 
[01:54:00]  That's one problem  And we might  We might adjust the hours  Accordingly just slightly  Just to give them  A better chance  To call on the show  We're kind of  Debating that now  I mean I love the program  And I love the show  It just seems like  It'd be fresher  If you adjusted more  For the schedule  But I tell you  You're right in a way dude  Like I've had the same thoughts  But while you get  More west coast people  You'd lose east coast people  Because most of the people  On the east coast  That we're calling in  Would be at work  Because for us to be on  In the morning in LA  We'd have to be on  Like mid mornings here  Which is like 10 or 11  Which doesn't 
[01:54:30]  I'd rather be on  The mornings here  If I had to choose  Because Philly  It was for me dude  I'm not complaining  I just was scared  It's a fine balance  And we're trying to  Figure it out as we go  You know we'll probably  Fine tune a little bit more  But that's how it has to be  A lot of people  Like go back to afternoons  It's impossible  This is a national radio show now  We can't do it that way  Believe me I would love to  Oh my god  We don't want to be here  At 5 in the morning  Trying to put this crap together  But on the replay  I do like the fact  That I can turn on  If I want to hear  Something from the show  It's really kind of  Growing on me to replay  I can just check it out  When I watch it 
[01:55:00]  Yeah and then you know  When we stink  So you go  I'll go do some errands  I'll come back  When Eric is running  In front of the news camera  You know that type of thing  The other thing too  Is there's some people  That like Stern  And like you  And I think you're  Pulling away from that  Stern audience  And coming here  Which is always a good thing  Well yeah  Well that's the beauty too  I mean people are like  Well why would you want to  Compete against Howard  And everybody else  These guys have huge followings  We're not competing  Against anyone  Because we have our own channel  And people can pretty much  Listen when they want to  If you want to listen  To Howard or another  Morning show  You know live  And then go to us later 
[01:55:30]  That's fine  We don't care  As long as you check out  The program  Well you guys rock  It's really good to hear you back  Thank you Chris  I got to address someone  Who wrote in too  This guy Jim from Boston  He said you signed Giambi  As a free agent Norton  Wasn't through a trade dummy  If I said trade  I know he's a free agent  I didn't mean trade  No you said  What we had to give up  Oh I meant  Yeah but Nick Johnson  Left as a result  Of Giambi coming  That's why they allowed him to go  And it was a boatload of cash  For a fat ass steroid head  That was sitting on a bench  Yeah no I didn't mean to imply  That he was traded for him  I know he wasn't  Alright  Vic in Cincinnati 
[01:56:00]  Hey what's going on fellas  Good morning  What's up Vic  Hey man I just caught  The replay online  Of that  Of Eric  Acting like a complete idiot  In front of the Fox  News camera yesterday  Oh yeah  Holy S dude  That is so effing funny  But I gotta tell you  If you guys don't  Nickname him Birdman  And play that stupid  Fucking Birdman call  Every time he walks  Into the studio  You're not doing it  Birdman call  What's the Birdman call  Yeah remember the old  Cartoon Birdman 
[01:56:30]  Oh yeah yeah yeah  Yeah the Birdman call  I think it would be funny  Bird bird bird bird  That old ridiculous song  Yeah we'll figure something out  We're thinking  You know Birdman might be  Better than Hawk actually  I like Birdman yeah  Right on  Well the video's up  On opiananthony.com  And it's part of  Our assault on the media  And there's gonna be  A whole greatest hits  Assault on the media  Up tonight  On opiananthony.com  And someone said  You gotta get the video  Of you guys getting the girl  To flash her boobs  Live on the Today Show  I think that's gonna be  Up there as well tonight

[01:57:30]  Oh the laughter  The laughter  You know when they  Play a bit  Just the laughter  In the background  You can't hear  You can't hear anything  I'm just  I just got tired of it  God damn  What do you mean  Are they yucking it up  Through the whole bit  You mean  Oh yeah  I think Bob and Tom  Were huge in Indianapolis  And then  They're syndicated to like  Every tiny little town  In America  That's the best  They ever  Well I'm in  Northwest Indiana  I'd pick them up  On four different  Radio stations  Wow  They are out of  Indianapolis  I know that  Alright  Yeah they are  Thank you Keith  Thanks man 
[01:58:00]  I didn't mean to  Hang up on you  I'm sorry  We got the lady  The lady  The Lacey Peterson  Verdict  Oh  Lacey Peterson  Verdict  The Lacey Peterson  Verdict  What is she accused  Of besides being mouthy  Which she's been  Convicted of  Her verdict is  Yeah you're right  A sentence  Has been carried out  That by the way  That thing you were  Looking out on your  Computer was just  Hilarious and revolting  At the same time  Some mutant  Decided to make  A wedding invitation  Is this on  One of our websites 
[01:58:30]  I don't know  God what creeps  We attract  The Ramses  And the Petersons  Cordially invite you  To the wedding  Of Lil Conor  And JonBenet  Adam Walsh  Parentheses  With or without  His head  Will be  Honorary ring bearer  And it is a  Photoshopped picture  That is disgusting  It's got  JonBenet's head  On a bride's body  Some type of  Only looks to be 
[01:59:00]  A submerged baby head  On the groom's body  And then there's  The Petersons  And the  Ramses  And the Ramses  And what's the best  Part  Is look in the guy's  Left hand  Yes  In Conor's  Left hand  Is what appears  To be Adam Walsh's  Head  And the one woman  Has her arm  Around the boy's chest  And he's headless  Yes  That could be  The most repugnant  Yet enjoyable  Thing I've ever seen  I mean 
[01:59:30]  He obviously  Put a little work  Into it  Research  Some Photoshop  Skills  But you should  Slap that together  In five minutes  You should have  Nightmares  You disgusting man  That was rough  Nightmares  I hope you have  Nightmares  Wendy what's up  Hi  I have song intro ideas  Song intro ideas  For Noah and Eric  Yes  Okay  Noah  Definitely  Sex Machine  James Brown  Alright  And for Eric  Of course  Jungle Love  More's Day in the Time 
[02:00:00]  Oh  More's Day  Yeah  Oh okay  We might have to  Yeah I know that song  Yeah yeah  We'll have to try that out  I think that works  Excellent  Alright  Have a good day guys  Alright  Bye  I meant to say that  We had Lacey Peterson's song  And then I said Lacey Peterson  Very because we want to play  The Scott Peterson  Very good as well  And I'm  Got it all messed up  Were you there in front of the TV  When they had the announcement  I heard it was going to be 4.30  So I  Went inside  Turned it on  And had to listen to  CNN and Fox News  Babble  For about 15 minutes 
[02:00:30]  Before they actually had the verdict  They have nothing to talk about  Fox News  Just talking about how  Will  They had two guys  Arguing  Will it be better for him  To get the death penalty  Or  Life in prison without parole  Now you would think  This isn't even an argument  But these  Two guys are going at each other  Like no  It would be much better for him  To get the death penalty  Because California  Has like 600 people  On death row  And they execute  An average of one a year  So do the math  It's going to take a little while  To get to old  Scotty Peterson  I don't think they'll ever kill him 
[02:01:00]  They won't  California is  Very  You know  Very lax  They have the death penalty  But like New York  Just don't  Don't use it  Well they said in the paper today  The death penalty is way down  Across America  Yeah  They're barely using it these days  It's because  You know  They appeal it  The lawyers get in there  Right  The red tape  And a lot of red tape  So he's looking at about  Like we have the death penalty  Here in New York  Oh we don't use it  We've never used it  No  How long has it been in  It's been  But you know what it is  It's different  Because we have prosecutors  That won't even try to get it  Robert Johnson in the Bronx 
[02:01:30]  Yeah  They won't even try  Like at least in California  They're like  Yeah get this guy the death penalty  They give it to him  But then it takes forever  That's how they satisfy  Some of the voters  You know  They want the death penalty  But they give the voters  The death penalty  But then they don't tell you  Well we're never going to use it  We're never going to use it  But we have it  How long have we had  The death penalty in New York  Someone could help us out  On the instant feedback  10 years  I guess since Pataki got in  So how long is that  8, 10 years  I don't know  Because Cuomo was a staunch  Anti-death penalty faggot  The whole death penalty thing  Is a joke at this point  Oh I know  So if you have it 
[02:02:00]  Use it  What they were saying  With Scott Peterson  Is he could be in there  A good 20 years  Before he even got  The death penalty  If ever  And during that time  If you're on death row  You're in solitary confinement  You're not in the  General population  You spend all the hours  In your cell  You get a little time out  That's supervised  And that's it  The only contact you have  Is through yelling  Back and forth  To other death row inmates  So he's safer  How do you live your life  Like that? 
[02:02:30]  It's something you should  Think about  Before you dump your wife  Into the drink  I don't mind  If they scrap the death penalty  And just give people  Life in prison without parole  I'm kind of cool with that  I don't know  Because it never  Ever seems like  Life in prison  Without parole  Something always happens  And years and years later  They're old guys  And you know  They decide  Oh you could let them out  You know  Life without prison  Life in prison  Without parole  Doesn't mean that  Somehow you can get  Off  You know  The governor  Or the president 
[02:03:00]  Can pardon you  Things happen  And these people  Should just be  Wiped off the face  Of the earth  I agree with you  I don't disagree  I don't think it's cruel and unusual  Like the ACLU said  I just  I don't have enough faith  In the fact that  Nobody innocent will ever get  That's my only problem  It's not a cruel and unusual issue  For me  I don't know  If you have money  You can  Like OJ  We all know it was a racial thing  But he had the money to afford  He had the money to afford  Certain type of experts  And certain type  You understand  If everybody was getting  The exact same defense  I wouldn't have so much  Of a problem with it  I don't know  All the death penalty cases 
[02:03:30]  I've ever read about  It certainly seems like  They're guilty  But then again  You have these guys  Most of them I think are  But then you have these guys  That go after  People that are not  Like legally innocent  Like people  Not technicality innocent  But people that actually  Didn't commit the crime  And they're fighting  To get them off death row  And they say that a lot of times  The courts don't even have  To hear the cases  Because the evidence  Came in late  Or some bullshit like that  That's what bugs me  Those little technical glitches  Yeah where you're actually  Innocent and it can be proven  But some DA doesn't want  Egg on his face  So they fight to keep  The evidence out  That's what kind of  Bothers me  Or prosecute 
[02:04:00]  I've never seen that  On a death penalty case though  Yeah there's plenty  I've seen it in cases  Where the guy's been  Sitting rotting in prison  And perhaps he didn't do  That crime  I've never seen him  Go out and go  Well thank god  This professor's back  Teaching again  Very rare yeah  It's always you know  Sharpen up your screwdriver  For another victim  On the subway you animal  Alright so the verdict  Of course Bernie Goetz  Dude we gotta get him in here  I love Bernard Goetz  We're trying to get him in here  Love to have him on the show  I don't know  Maybe that one will happen  Tom Cruise didn't happen yesterday 
[02:04:30]  But maybe we'll get Bernie  I'd rather have Bernie Goetz  Ah true  A Tom Cruise interview  Would have been a waste of time  No it would have been a lot of fun  But I felt like Tom Cruise  Just so we could say  Hey we had Tom Cruise on our show  Yeah  What kind of radio  Is he really gonna give you  Not like Tom Cruise  Stood over an animal  Pointed his gun  And said you don't look so bad  He shot him again  And that Ron Coolby  Should also slip in a puddle of age  And crack his teeth on a urinal  For defending that scumbag  Daryl KB  And going after him  In the civil court  He's the you know  Defend the obviously guilty guy 
[02:05:00]  Ugh  Yeah maybe someday  New York death penalty  Nine years since 1995  So the verdict came in yesterday  And now all the jurors  Are getting their mugs  All over TV today  Jurors are the worst  That red headed chick  That hussy  She got her hair did  I got my hair did  She's on all the morning shows  And now it looks like  It's like some kind of  Reddish perm now  It is raggedy and red  And she's wearing  Like too much blush 
[02:05:30]  And she loves that camera  These jurors  They sit on these cases  These high profile cases  They get this feeling  Of self importance  Because they have  Some guy's life in their hands  A lot of media coverage  Whether they see it or not  They know it's being covered  And then when they get let out  And the press is clamoring  To talk to them  All of a sudden  They're stars  They're stars  Remember all the jurors  From the sniper case  Oh remember  Remember stupid red headed bitch  Because that's  What's going to be you 
[02:06:00]  You'll be a star  Fade away again  Or the OJ juror  That had her own HBO special  Remember that black girl  She had her own HBO special  She's everything  The black community hates  And justifiably so  Because she talks like that  She's a black girl  Who talks like that  And she had her own HBO special  Where she sat there  And did like a one man  Spalding Gray type of show  I wish she'd do  Spalding Gray's last act  Kill yourself  A swan dive  Kill yourself  From the ferry  And she gave this  Melodramatic drivel  One person show  About the case 
[02:06:30]  It was revolting  They all get put  In the position now  Where they're celebrities  They're chasing  This redhead around now  One of them's always  The standout  During the sniper case  It was that black guy  With the Aaron Neville  Stuff all over his head  And he was the one  And then they find out  That he had all kinds  Of problems with the law  These people ought to  Shut their yaps  If they're  You know  They just slink away somewhere  And now it's the redhead  They're chasing her around  Like crazy  And that other guy too  With the short hair 
[02:07:00]  Yeah  That was sitting right next to her  Yeah this guy  He's on TV right now  On Fox News  Steve Carlesi  Steve Carlesi?  What?  Well we thought he was guilty  Because  Our own Steve  Was a juror?  The juror with the flaming tie  So here's the verdict  As it was read yesterday  People of the state of California  Versus Scott Peterson  We the jury  And the above entitled cause  Fixed the penalty at death  Dated December 13th

Yes  Alright  Would you call the jury please?

The lawyer did a great job for Scotty Boy  All those scumbags  And then they do that  Put the arm around the guy  In the courtroom  Like that's going to help at all  He's like we're going to appeal  That guy is going to run  I forgot his name  Mark Garagos  Yeah Garagos

[02:10:30]  Everyone deserves fair representation  No I know  In the court of law Jim  You know if some lawyers want to  Exclusively do that for the cash  And for the spotlight  Right  That's their business  I didn't do anything  My fingerprints just happen to be  On the same pornographic magazine  As this other boy  Fucking thin-nosed racial subcars  Sell out  God do I hope he goes to prison  And kills himself  You will see people that will 
[02:11:00]  Back Michael Jackson  To their grave  Good  And think that he is  Well there are people out there  That will back anyone  OJ  Remember all the OJ people  Backers  Were they really backing OJ though  Or were they just doing it  Going look I know he's guilty  But  Just say it  Do you remember black people  Yes  Black people  They knew this  They cheered  That cheered  When OJ was found not guilty  It was Cochran  They were cheering  They weren't cheering OJ  They know he did it  It was more like  This is what black people  This is how it feels  Now do you see the system  Is fucked up 
[02:11:30]  Now do you see  That's what that vibe was about  Yeah  They knew he did it  And then Michael Jackson  I got my own mother  My own mother  I'm disgusted with her  When we talk about Michael Jackson  I don't think he did it  Really  What do you base that on  That you like his songs  You know  What do you base that on  The guy is  There's so much evidence  There's so much past  That he's had  That you got to assume 
[02:12:00]  That he's done all this stuff  Why are you having kids  Over your house  Why are your fingerprints  On porno magazines  That your little kids  Fingerprints are on  Why are you paying their parents  Millions of dollars  With written contracts  For them to shut up  So what does your mom  Your mama  Mama  So what does your mom  Think happen  Mama  Like what's her take  On this whole thing  Her take  Is that he is just  A poor guy  Who never had a childhood  That enjoys  The company of children  Is that a little weird 
[02:12:30]  Sure  But is it a crime  Is he  Molesting these children  What about the alarms  In his bedroom  That  You know  That tell him  That people are coming  Toward his bedroom  He's got a Cheez-It alarm  Really  That's what  Right  Latoya said that he's got  Sensor alarms  Walking up to his bedroom  So he'll know  When people are coming  Maybe the parents  Should have put  Alarms up the kids butts  Michael Jackson  Finger detectors  Skinny little  Pale vitiligo  Finger goes in there 
[02:13:00]  Whoop whoop whoop  Remove your finger  From the child  Remove your finger  From the child  This butt  Is protected  From Michael Jackson  His finger  Is not white anymore  No  That's right  I just want to  Get my skin color  Right  I had some vitiligo  On my index finger  And it was looking  Like it was 
[02:13:30]  Too white  For my hand  So I thought  A young boy  Might be able  To brown it up  So I could get  Some cinnamon color  To it  Cinnamon lips  God do I hope  He goes to prison  I really hope  He kills himself  And your mom  Is just defending him  Because she's just  A fellow singer  And like  Oh yeah  That must have been it  The singers all  Come to each other's aid  Hi Michael  I'm thinking  You know  I know you want  To get off the children  Perhaps you could  Just go downstairs  And get on the treadmill  Or something  You know  I know that

[02:19:00]  Okay, terrific.  It's over, Jenny.  Just horrific.  I don't know what to say.  That's my life at every party.  Never gets old.  Jesus.  That's my life at every party.  Oh, my father needed a motorboat and a cinder block. 
[02:19:30]  Hey, Dad, what are you doing?  Nothing, Ant.  Back to the dock.  Dad, I thought we came out here to go fishing.  No, Ant, just give me a hand with this.  It's a little garbage from the house.  There we go.  Whoa, why are we going home so fast?  Oh, my God. 
[02:20:00]  Dave in New York.  Janis Joplin could do a better job now.  Dave, what's up?  I love it.  I love it.  Janis Joplin would have told my mother, hey, I think you had too much to drink.  Oh, Dave?  Yeah, guys, that was great.  That was fantastic. 
[02:20:30]  It's something you've got to be there.  You've got to actually be there to see the visual on that.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Were you?  What's that?  Were you a guest at a party?  No, I would have loved to see that, though.  I would have loved to see that old Bobby McGee thing.  Yeah, it's pretty good.  You've got to take it on the road.  All right, let's go to Al in Cleveland.  Hey, Al, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Welcome to Joe.  I just wanted to say real quick, I don't understand why Jimmy's so pissed at Jackson. 
[02:21:00]  You know, he's just trying to play with kids, and kids that play together, you know, they  don't molest each other.  Right, Jimmy?  Well, that's a good point, sir.  I had experience when I was a youngster, and I was a dirty boy, so if I was still into that  as an adult, I'd be even a filthier boy.  Right, but you were just a kid.  Any adult that hangs out with kids like that, you're not Peter Pan, you're a scumbag, and  a predator, and a pedophile, and I hope you go to jail and kill yourself.  Wow.  Nice.  Mike from Washington.  Yeah, just wanted to say, hey, what's up, you guys, and tell you a good joke real quick. 
[02:21:30]  What's Michael Jackson and Kmart have in common?  Oh, no.  I think I have boys' pants half off?  Yep, they both have little boys' pants half off.  Hey, you guys, take that off.  It's a good holiday.  All right, we got the Lacey Peterson song.  Oh, God.  This is horrific.  Is it?  Yeah.  It's such a fitting little tune.  Is it lighthearted? 
[02:22:00]  Well, it's very lighthearted.  I think you're going to think it's lighthearted, sure.  Now, I've got to say something first.  This is really, really horrific.  We got a song in, I think, yesterday, and me and Opie listened to it before the show started,  and we were like, no.  What song?  We're not playing this.  Now we have to play it, because now we've brought it to the attention of everybody.  But it was a Lacey Peterson song, but it was just, like, brutal and really nothing creative or...  Was it the chemistry one?  Was it the rap one? 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  Just really bad.  There's no reason to use the C word.  Oh, okay, okay, okay.  Like, unless it's S-E-A.  You're a quick motherfucker.  Damn, is that funny?  Arr, this is the E.  Yeah, there's no reason for that.  I mean, it's tragic, it's dark, but you've got to keep it lighthearted, don't you? 
[02:23:00]  Believe it or not, there is a method to this, and there is a line.  Should we play the brutal one that we got in today?  Oh.  Who did this, by the way?  We don't know?  They got today or yesterday?  It came in today.  And then maybe we'll play the one we played from last week, the serious one.  Oh, right, good.  Yeah, yeah, we've got to play the serious one again.  Yeah.  So we'll...  What?  Oh, the serious one is so bad.  It's just terrible.  Mommy, these for you. 
[02:23:30]  Remember?  Oh, mama.  Mama.  Mama.  Mama, these for you.  This is today's song?  Yeah.  Okay.  You said a handful of seaweed.  A little bouquet of seaweed.  Mama.  Brr.  Why are you talking like Count Chocula?  Brr.  Brr.  Brr.  Brr.  Brr.  Maddie, let's shoot this fucker.  Nobody gives two fucks for Connor.  I like to wear plastic bags over my head. 
[02:24:00]  Connor or Glenda.  Plan nine for Modesto.  All right, Scott, now get in the rowboat.  Cut.  Perfect.  Print it.  A man his size would have trouble drowning his wife and getting away.  This is the murder they'll remember me for. 
[02:24:30]  I like to wear plastic bags over my head.  Oh, fuck.  Anyway.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, the new one.  Yeah, the new Lacey Peterson song was done by Ass Suck.  Ass Suck?  This is from the Ass Suck?  The one and only Ass Suck from Wackbag.com.  Wow.  Yeah. 
[02:25:00]  So, hit it.  This is brutal.  Are you ready, kids?  Hi-hi, Captain!  I can't hear you!  Hi-hi, Captain!  Who lives in a body bag under the sea.  Lacey Peterson!  Absorbent and bloated and pregnant, was she?  Lacey Peterson!  Where noise-eating, nagging Scott won't miss?  Lacey Peterson!  Her and Connor are food for the fish. 
[02:25:30]  Lacey Peterson!  Lacey Peterson!  Lacey Peterson!  Lacey Peterson!  Lacey Peterson!  Lacey Peterson!  Lacey Peterson!  Lacey Peterson!  Lacey Peterson!  Lacey Peterson!  Yeah.  Uh...  What a great motorboard.  That's a great sound clip at the end.  That is a good motorboat.  You should steal that one.  It's a lot bigger than the motorboat I have. 
[02:26:00]  Great splash.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Wow.  You knew it was bad when it started off with seagulls and ocean noises.  Yeah.  Yeesh.  Will Spongebob Squarepants theme song.  Oh, is that what that was?  Yeah, yeah.  That's from Spongebob.  Oh, that's funny.  Thank you, Ass Suck.  Ass Suck.  Okay, horrific.  Some of the reviews, early reviews are in.  Oh, yeah.  That was sympathetic. 
[02:26:30]  No, we're playing the sympathetic one next.  That was a good parody, though.  I mean, it wasn't dirty.  It was just, it was funny.  It was quick.  You could understand the words.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  I'm actually working on a song parody called, We Sink Right Past the Yellow Submarine.  I'm so glad.  Vases blue and feet are green.  We passed the yellow submarine in Modesto, C.A. 
[02:27:00]  And he told us of his life on the faithful Christmas Day.  Okay.  So we say love to the sun until we find the sea of green.  Play the, yeah.  The sea of green. 
[02:27:30]  Well.  I wasn't going to follow.  There's no way I was going to follow the feet of green.  And I just couldn't lay on it.  No.  I'm so glad the verdict is in.  Thank God.  We will.  We're going to move on now, right?  Of course we're going to move on.  Absolutely.  There'll be another horrible case.  Michael, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How are y'all doing?  Good.  Hi.  I'm just glad that I'll have company in hell because I'm definitely going after laughing  at that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was.  It was a rough one.  That was horrible.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll read all the hate mail tomorrow on the O.P. and Anthony show.  All right.  You guys are great. 
[02:28:00]  Keep up the good work.  All right.  Let's go to Josh in Utah.  What's up, Josh?  Oh, my God, guys.  That was the funniest fucking thing I've ever heard in my life.  I almost fucking crashed.  That was my $2 worth for the next three years.  Punch it out.  There he goes.  All right.  Well, now let's play this beautiful song.  This one is a tribute to Lacey Peterson done by what's his name?  Got an emissary?  No.  Facefuck. 
[02:28:30]  This one was written seriously.  John Strand.  Oh, there you go.  And this guy's even worse.  He's awful.  Yeah.  Because he already wrote a 9-11 song after that happened.  And now he's just trying to capitalize on tragedy.  He wrote this song as a serious tribute to her.  He's got a horrible voice.  And this song stinks.  It's full of cliches and trying to tug at your heartstrings, but it's so corny. 
[02:29:00]  Drippy, phony, altruism.  Yeah.  Deucebag.  I'd say he's one notch above us as far as being a scumbag in this situation.  No, he's below us.  You put him below us?  By eight notches.  Because our motives look we're dicks and we're being dicks and we're goofing on something.  But there's no hidden agenda in here.  We're not trying to make ourselves deep by latching on to a tragedy.  He's really trying to elevate himself and attach himself and somehow be like the voice of reason.  And he's a scumbag. 
[02:29:30]  Dishonest motives.  It's haunting, though.  It's beautiful.  Elton John.  Wood block.  A good rhyming scheme, douche.  Remembering Lacey, how she loved, there's no denial.  Now the angels hold her gently, and little Connor's with her, too. 
[02:30:00]  And she smiles and says, we're all right, and we send our love to you.  As the fishes start to chew.  So full of life and happiness was pretty Lacey's life.  What?  Her life was full of life?  What a dick.  Just made things seem so right. 
[02:30:30]  Too bad she was a shitty wife.  Well, she says a lot with duct tape on her mouth, doesn't she?  Here's that bell-made flowers bloom on earth in heaven, too.  Here comes.  And little Connor runs and picks them.  Mama, these for you. 
[02:31:00]  Now the angels are deep in the room.  What a horse shit.  Yuck.  The only thing he's handing her is placenta.  The heavens, look, the Lacey Connor star.  Lacey Connor star.  Remembering Lacey, how her smile would make you smile. 
[02:31:30]  On your smile.  Remembering Lacey, how she loved there's no denial.  Now the angels hold her gently, and little Connor's with her, too.  And she smiles and says, we're all right, and we send our love to you.  It's a bitches out of bitches. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  It's a bitches out of bitches.  It certainly is.  And what she really smiles and says is,  Smile makes you smile.  What an awful voice.  Remembering Lacey.  La, yearn, yearn, yearn.  The Lacey star. 
[02:32:30]  Mama, these for you.  He didn't say anything.  He was a fetus.  Stop presenting him like he was little Connor the child.  I understand.  It's tragic.  It's tragic.  She was a pregnant woman.  Let's not forget that.  Ugh.  Why are they treating it like he was...  How was he convicted of murdering that, also?  Like, murder the wife, first degree, boom.  Death.  Kill him.  Why do they have to add on that he killed a child?  He didn't.  Couldn't...  Could this is...  I actually agree with that, just because he's such a scumbag. 
[02:33:00]  Because I think they said that Connor could have survived outside the womb.  That was the argument.  Yeah, but a child isn't really a child until it comes out.  That seems to be the law that, you know, that we're going by, that we've decided to go by in this country.  And until it comes out, it isn't really, you know...  Well, women's groups actually, like feminist movement, will actually agree with you.  Because they were afraid that anything that identified a fetus as having a right of some sort would chip into Roe v. Wade.  But I don't think...  Slippery slope can apply to anything. 
[02:33:30]  What happens here?  What happens if a woman's pregnant, something happens where perhaps she's injured and the baby dies inside her.  Is somebody now responsible, if they were responsible for injuring the mother and baby there, but the mother doesn't die,  could you then be brought up on charges of murder for the child?  I don't know the technicality of that.  I don't know.  I honestly don't know.  Because that would be...  If you murdered her intentionally, I'd probably, yeah.  Apparently, you can be.  Like, if you punched her...  I mean, if it was a car accident, you wouldn't be brought up on murder charges.  But if you punched her, yeah, I think so. 
[02:34:00]  And the baby died, but the mother didn't, you could then be charged with murdering something that isn't really...  It's a good question.  I don't know.  I don't know.  But just because that technicality exists doesn't mean that such a predator who does that shouldn't be charged.  You know what I mean?  But that's something that has to be worked out.  It just seems odd that they gave the fetus a little name.  Yeah.  Which they do.  I know people do that when they have kids, you know.  But...  And that people are really kind of thinking of this like it's Lil Conner running around,  Mama, these for you, yapping and talking as the...  Little fetus. 
[02:34:30]  I understand.  It's tragic and all, but let's all get a grip here.  And let's be honest.  He may have hated flowers when he was born.  Who knows?  Might have been allergic to them.  And he may have been a bad boy and knocked her flowers over.  Scott may have saved that family a lot of grief.  More tragedy.  A lot of stained rugs.  Dave, what do you have for the show today?  Hey, what's up?  Norton and everybody.  Hi, Dave.  Yeah, man.  Like that motherfucker knows her or something.  You know, like writing a song about somebody who knows. 
[02:35:00]  Like, is that something you hear up on the church stage special or something?  Yeah, the guy kind of wrote that like he knew her.  Yeah.  You know, how does he know her love was no, you know.  Her love was no denial?  Yeah, apparently someone denied it.  Scott denied it.  Apparently her smile wasn't that bright.  No offense.  Somebody didn't like it, right?  Yeah, that smile irked somebody.  Just a bit.  You want to write about somebody's love and smile, write about Amber's.  Apparently that was quite addicting.  James from Illinois, what's up?  Hey, that guy is so unoriginal. 
[02:35:30]  That tune is the Blue Bell Country ice cream.  What?  Melody.  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  He ripped off the melody?  Okay.  He ripped off the melody from a commercial jingle.  That's how pathetic he is.  We're trying to get this jerk off on the phone, but of course he won't come on the show.  Remembering me.  We got his number and everything?  He won't come on?  I wasn't trying to.  Jason from Georgia.  What's up?  Hey, Jim, you're really unsympathetic about that faceless kid.  I mean, now that... 
[02:36:00]  No, no, I'm not.  What's that?  The faceless kid you were talking about earlier.  I'm not unsympathetic.  I actually felt really bad.  I'm not unsympathetic at all.  And I even said I felt bad saying it.  I wasn't trying to be a dick when I was saying that.  The video's up on opianthony.com.  I got to say, it's horrific.  I feel bad for the parents.  Completely feel bad for them.  I mean, the kid looks like it has a lot of love.  And it looks like it's living, quote, a normal life besides the fact that she doesn't really...  Well, she has a face.  It's just really effed up. 
[02:36:30]  You know those calamari things from Star Wars?  Last Star Wars movie?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what the baby looks like.  Exactly.  With a little blonde wig on it.  Why did you...  So why did you say I was unsympathetic, sir?  Remembering fish face.  What did he hang up?  He hung up.  I wanted to hear what he had to say.  He probably heard what you said about the spade shovel and blame me.  Oh, oh, oh.  Well, it did look like a divot.  With a little blonde wig on.  Like you teed up on our nose and took a little whack. 
[02:37:00]  Want to step aside?  Yeah, so I could read the Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2003.  Oh, good.  And it was because of Lacey Peterson.  I have to agree with it, though.  Well, if you commit a murder like that, I don't know.  Hey, tag as much as you can on it.  Yeah, I agree.  But it sets a precedent for something that you might get somebody in trouble for something  that was kind of like an oops.  You know, now if you have a traffic accident, let's say, and the baby, a pregnant woman's 
[02:37:30]  in there, and she has a miscarriage, all of a sudden, are you up for manslaughter charges?  Oh, I don't know, man.  I don't think.  I don't think.  Let's just stop there.  I just don't think.  Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes-Benz?  My friends all drop horses.  I must make a name.  We're smart all my life with no help from my friends.  Shut your ass.  Oh, Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes-Benz? 
[02:38:00]  Shoot him now!  Shoot him now!  Not on your goddamn radio!  Lord!  Shut up!  Lord!  This is retarded.  Lord!  Stop it!  Ow!  Lord!  Get in your mouth!  What the hell is going on?  Is that supposed to be sexy?  Hey, hey, hey! 
[02:38:30]  Hey, hey, hey!  Shut up, stupid!  God damn, is that funny?  Not on your goddamn radio!  Oh, what a bitch!  Oh, my ass, son of a bitch!  No!  Shut your mouth!  I can't shut your fucking mouth!

I'll tell you what I like about Chinese people.  As long as we're on the subject.  They're hanging in there with those chopsticks.  Still using chopsticks.  You know they've seen the fork.  Oh, they're well aware that we have the fork. 
[02:41:30]  And the spoon.  I don't know how they missed it.  Chinese farmer getting up working in the field with a shovel all day.  Hello, shovel.  There it is.  You're not plowing 40 acres with a couple of pool cues.  I'm sorry, was that homophobic?  No.  I think it was.  Because I hear that a lot.  Dave, what?  You're talking about being gay.  You probably secretly are gay.  And I'm like, listen, voice in my head. 
[02:42:00]  I'm not.  How do you know you wouldn't like it?  How do you know you wouldn't like it?  I know I wouldn't like it.  Other scarier voice in my head.  Because one time while making a sandwich,  a cucumber went up my ass.  Three times.  If that ever happens, you need two things and two things quick. 
[02:42:30]  A pair of ice tongs.  And a friend who can keep a secret.  Preferably your midget friend.  Because no one believes in midgets until it's too late.  They're just too cute.  They get excited, start jumping up and down.  You think they're telling you a riddle or something.  What?  Cucumber up a man's ass?  Is that where the treasure is?  Well, then lead me into your midget world. 
[02:43:00]  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  XM202.  Head like a hole.  Black as your soul.  I'd rather die than give you control.  Head like a hole.  Black as your soul.  I'd rather die than give you control.  Bow down before the one you serve. 
[02:43:30]  You're going to get what you deserve.  Bow down before the one you serve.  You're going to get what you deserve.  And we're back with the O.N.A. virus.  That was really loud in the headphones, huh?  I hope we didn't blast you out in the radio land.  Go ahead, Ant.  I said sets a precedent, you idiot. 
[02:44:00]  I didn't say sets a president.  Like, you know, for example, George Washington.  Open your fucking ears, jackass.  George Washington is going to make me laugh all day today.  George Washington.  There's always one thing you remember from the show.  Yesterday, I think it was Eric doing the whole thing in front of the Fox reporter.  Today, it's just going to be simple.  George Washington.  George Washington.  George Washington. 
[02:44:30]  That's your seven cents today.  Let's say hi to Frank in Jersey.  Hey, Frank.  Hey.  How are you guys doing, man?  I'm doing good.  We're doing good.  All right.  What is the 12th day of Christmas?  Man, I've been waiting since Monday, and I haven't heard.  Oh, the Guido Christmas.  The Guido song.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, it was all tree godfodders.  All tree godfodders.  There you go.  You got to play that song.  Oh, no, we don't.  We're Italian folks.  All right?  No, we don't.  No, we don't. 
[02:45:00]  Go find it online or something.  There you go, O.  Good point.  Opie shut it off before number 12, and I didn't even care enough, and I'm sitting here to want  to know what the 12th is.  I still don't know what the 12th is.  And I haven't asked.  I don't care.  I got the Gary Hoey CD in.  Gary Heavy.  Is he coming in at all?  I don't know.  What's going on with that?  He always pours around on Christmas.  Ben's going to try to book him, actually.  We were just talking about that.  Well, are we going to get him before Christmas?  What's wrong with your eyes, Steve?  I clobbered myself in the eye.  Let me see.  Why are you so emotional today? 
[02:45:30]  Why are you crying?  All the love in the room?  Why are you crying?  Is it smoke?  Yes.  Because you're not wearing as much flaming clothes.  Have they gone out, and they're smoldering into your eyes?  Smoldering.  Exactly.  I literally picked up a cardboard box.  There was another cardboard box in front of it.  It flipped up, and the corner whacked me right in the goddamn eye.  Where's Gary Hoey?  In the CD player.  No.  When are we going to get him in studio?  Are we going to get him before Christmas, hopefully?  Ben is actually working on that right now.  Or are you guys booking him for Groundhog Day?  What's Ben working on?  I don't see Ben doing a whole lot of anything except eating cereal and herky and jerky all 
[02:46:00]  over the studio.  Herky and jerky.  I'm taking calls on his tiny little cell phone.  His little tiny cell phone.  That chiclet cell phone.  If somebody walks in too fast, he can just eat his phone.  Ben's phone stinks.  What do you carry that?  Your cock hole?  What kind of phone is that?  Dude, hey.  He's gossiping about something.  Dude, Pedro does coke.  What?  My friend Tim from Boston knows what he does.  It's always some drivel he heard from some drunken mick at a party. 
[02:46:30]  Dude, I think I've bought it from you too.  It's coming in.  I think it's such horse shit.  Dude, I caught my hand with a car bomb.  You forgot that.  That's insane.  That's crazy.  That's crazy.  It's insane.  It's crazy.  It's insane.  It's nuts.  He just giggles about nothing.  I'm like, Ben, I've got to get this done.  Giggling idiot.  He was laughing when you guys were talking serious about the death penalty. 
[02:47:00]  Did anyone else catch it?  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, dude, there's just too many poor people.  Get it.  Here he comes.  Here he comes.  Who doesn't love Ben?  I like the parody of Ben better than Ben now.  I thought someone got one of their teeth knocked out.  It was Ben's phone.  Your phone needs a filling.  I love the fact that he's always gossiping.  That's the best.  Always gossiping about somebody who has something to do with Boston. 
[02:47:30]  Jim Rice is from Western Children.  What?  Easy.  Oh, man.  God damn, that's funny.  Let me see your phone, Ben.  You got it on you?  Or did you lose it?  Look at this.  Look how little that is.  Wow.  That'll be some small phones.  That stinks anyway.  It doesn't work that well.  It's a tiny little phone. 
[02:48:00]  Are we going to get Gary Hoey in here?  Gary Halley, yes.  Yeah, we're working on it.  Where are we going to put him, though?  You going to put him in here?  Yeah.  Yeah, he just has his guitar and a little, you know.  Gary Halley.  He does rockin' Christmas tunes.  Takes Christmas songs and rocks him out with his guitar prowess.  And they're good, right?  Yeah.  We could play a quick one here.  Your mean one, Mr. Grinch, is really cool.  The Grinch one's like the best one he does, yeah.  Really good guitarist. 
[02:48:30]  We'll check this out, and then we'll go to the phones, and then we got Tommy Chong.  He's not a dime bag, but, you know.  Dime bag.  He wants to be buried.  Well, I guess the family wants him buried in a kiss coffin?  Gotta respect that.  Maybe it was in his will or something.  He's a big kiss fan, I guess.  One of those kiss coffins.  Gene Simmons is...  Oh, we forgot to talk about China, too.  Oh, my God.  How much are they charging?  We've got so much to do.  I thought Gene Simmons was maybe calling in today, huh?  Yeah.  Him and Tom Cruise.  That was actually on the list.  Was it today?  Gene Simmons?  Yeah, on the email.  Oh, I think I did see that.  Oh, all right.  We've got a chance of Gene Simmons, J-E-A-N, the actress, calling in. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, my God.  Isn't that used to confuse you?  Yep.  Reading TV Guide, it's like a movie with Gene Simmons in it.  Wow, I didn't know he did movies in 1958.  That's cool.  That Ben parody is hilarious.  I wish people could see it, and they just...  You gotta know Ben.  No, they get it.  You just gotta know Ben.  He's so herky.  He's always moving around.  He's so jerky.  And he just always laughs in the wrong places.  Yeah.  When you're, like, being serious.  Like, dude, look, I'm running late.  Look, give me some gossip. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, that's some gossip.  Yeah, it's like a marketer.  He's doing coke and fake guns.  What?  Always gossiping.  Always a little gossip.  Wow.  Because he does.  He knows everyone in Boston.  Everyone.  So any bit of news that comes out of Boston...  He knows everything about Boston.  Everything that the common folk read about in Boston, he will know, like, ten layers deep  into the story. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Dude, I was fucking hanging out with Tom Brady.  And he's like, what?  What happened with Tom Brady?  Probably some scandal that never materializes.  He was with ten broads or something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think that was the Tom Brady gossip.  Yes, I got that call.  Dude, I was with the Crafts at the new stadium.  There's a body buried in the basement.  It's insane.  I swear.  What?  It's crazy.  It's insane.  It's nuts.  I would have called you, but my phone was in my ear.  I couldn't get it out.  So I got a toothpick.  I got my phone stuck between my teeth. 
[02:50:30]  I got to pick it out, dude.  His phone makes me physically ill.  All right.  A quick hit of Gary Hoey.  What the hell?  We'll be right back. 
[02:51:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:51:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:52:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:52:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:53:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:53:30]  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  Nice, Gary Hoey.  That does indeed rock.  You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch.  I play that all year round.  I really enjoy that.  No.  Yeah, these Christmas CDs are awesome. 
[02:54:00]  They are very good.  He puts out.  Opie.  Yes, Anthony.  I guess because of Dimebag being buried in the Kiss Coffin.  Vanilla Thunder from Philly.  Will Lacey and Connor be buried in a fish coffin?  P-H-I-S-H.  Not bad.  Not bad.  That's good.  He's thinking.  Okay.  And Opie chews away.  What are you eating?  Yeah, what is that?  High protein? 
[02:54:30]  It's awful.  Smoothies, by the way.  The interns want to know.  No, you know, I really enjoy that thing.  We're banning the smoothies.  It's like a drug.  It's like being on drugs because you know what it's going to do afterwards, but you insist  on doing it anyway.  Because you feel it.  You're okay for a while, and all of a sudden there's a heaviness from your mid-stomach to  your upper thighs, and you're like, if I don't sit soon, I'm going to drop 11 pounds  of feces into my underwear.  A thick, heavy deposit.  A solid evacuation.  Right. 
[02:55:00]  Hey, Mario, what's up?  And it piles up in the toilet.  What's going on, guys?  It's like some type of a weird, like one of the elements.  It just piles in the toilet.  There should be seagulls on it and garbage trucks dumping things.  It really is horrible.  What's going on, guys?  What's going on, Mario?  Hey, uh, what happened to Chester?  Oh, my Chester.  No, the cliffhanger on Friday.  Something happened to Chester.  I can't understand it.  He seemed fine. 
[02:55:30]  Chester was old, that's all.  Chester was just old, I guess.  Dude, dude, I know what happened.  It was the Boston mob, dude.  Don't fucking tune from fucking Sons of Chester with Tom Brady and fucking...  Still fucking Coke bottles.  I don't know.  I woke up.  Chester was fine last night.  We really don't know what happened to Chester.  We never had an autopsy done, right?  And I woke up and there was a big footprint on his side and he was limping.  I asked, what happened, Chester? 
[02:56:00]  And he just went, mm-mm.  I believe he was kicked in the liver.  Oh, let's go to the phones and talk to Paul in Kansas City.  Hey, Paul, what's going on?  In the liver.  Hey, you guys talked to me on my $2, but what's a WOW sticker?  Are you serious?  I'm just kidding what the hell you're talking about.  What's a WOW sticker?  Well...  The WOW...  Hey, I'm a new listener.  How new are you?  Brand new.  I just got the free play.  Milked me out of my $2, hard earned.  Oh, cool.  Nice.  Well, the WOW sticker is a thing Anthony and I started about seven or eight years ago 
[02:56:30]  when we were in Boston.  And it's a very simple concept.  It started with guys just putting Wows on their car.  And then now we got the official WOW sticker.  But WOW stands for Whip Them Out Wednesday or Whip Them Out Whenever.  When the girls see the WOW on your truck or your car, whether it's a sticker or a homemade  sign or, you know, you've probably seen them written in the back of the trucks in the  dirt.  That's the girl's sign that that guy in that truck or car or lady, because we hear the  ladies want this too, want to see some boobies. 
[02:57:00]  And there's a lot of girls out there that are more than willing to show you their boobs  as they're driving down the highway.  Well, thanks, Ray.  Or as you're driving down the highway.  I've listened for a long time.  You guys suck.  All right.  And if you want a WOW sticker, there's two ways of going about it.  You can go to opianthony.com and you can leave your name and address.  And what happens is that goes down to Washington.  And about two or three months later, you will get a WOW sticker.  That is a fact.  Two or three months.  Or you can just send a self-addressed stamped envelope right to us here in New York and 
[02:57:30]  we'll send it out immediately.  Well, they said they had a little glitch in the system.  And I think apparently they didn't realize that when you get a request for a sticker,  you have to open an envelope and put the sticker in and address it and put it in the little  blue box on the corner.  Oh.  Anthony, Danny has hundreds out there.  Hundreds of people have already mailed their self-addressed stamped envelopes to us right  here in New York.  They don't even want to bother with Washington anymore.  And I don't blame them.  We're not really a priority down there.  And we have to be a priority.  So now we're asking you if you want a WOW sticker, you just send us a self-addressed stamped  envelope and we'll send you the WOW stickers immediately. 
[02:58:00]  And we'll give you more than one.  Easy enough.  They're giving out one per person down there in Washington.  But people like to maybe stick one in their, I don't know, in their house, on their car,  what have you.  Now, you don't want to send out promotional stickers.  Then what's the address?  And is it on opnf.com?  Yeah.  It's 111 West 57th Suite 500 New York, New York 10019.  But it's up on the website.  Okay.  A little slower on that one.  Yeah, it's up on the website.  Just write Opie and Anthony, WOW sticker, XM Satellite Radio, you know, and they'll  get to us.  Or call the number.  They'll give it to you here. 
[02:58:30]  There you have it.  All right.  Or call Ben personally.  His phone number is one.  The whole phone can't fit anymore.  Jim from Boston.  What's up, Jim?  How you boys doing?  Pretty good today.  You want to rewind the show a couple minutes?  I'm sure.  Why not?  All right.  So speaking of that baby without a face, you know that sooner or later he's going to  be on the Maury Povich Show.  Oh, yeah.  It goes for Gary, you kid.  Yeah.  Maury loves the freaks on that show.  Maury is the king.  You're beautiful. 
[02:59:00]  You are such a cute little girl.  Yes.  Thanks, Jim.  Yes, you are.  Yes, you are.  Just an adorable little girl, aren't you?  He's all condescending.  And she did look like that one from the Star Wars.  That was a good call.  Wow.  The fish face people from Star Wars.  With a little blonde wig.  With a little blonde wig on it.  Maury is the king of the freak show.  He is the modern day carnival barker.  He just, he loads his show with things like progeria kids and fattest infants. 
[02:59:30]  And it's under the guise that he cares.  You know what's funny about the fat infants?  They always have a buffet table that the kids can't get to.  Oh, yeah.  It's like their motivation to keep the kids on the stage or something.  And they always have to get the fat kids in just their diapers.  You know, there's no shirt on.  Yeah, they never have them dressed.  Completely exploiting the kids and then making them believe they're not.  They only have them in diapers.  The kids never dress because the shock value isn't as good. 
[03:00:00]  Unless you're seeing like all the folds of fat in the kid's arm and everything.  And Maury is just like a circus act.  It's a sideshow.  Under the guise that he's caring and helping.  We're going to help you out.  We're going to, you know, your family and try to get this kid skinny again.  And no, you're not because you have him back the next year.  Remember when he did that?  You remember baby Tommy, don't you?  Let's bring Tommy.  And then the kid comes wild and he's twice as big as he was. 
[03:00:30]  So obviously Maury didn't help, but he brings him back on.  Another freak show.  And all the dumb women are going, oh.  Yeah.  Like it's so cute.  But meanwhile in a bar when that fatso hits on them,  they're going to talk to their cock blocking friends and leave.  Really?  Why don't you all when the guy's trying to get laid in 18 years?  Buy you a drink, you cock tases.  And then the Pajeria kids he has on.  You know those little kids that they're only like.  Age way too fast.  They're like five, six, seven years old, and they look like they're about 90. 
[03:01:00]  They talk like midgets.  They got that little high voice, and they're like, well, you know, I'm just a normal kid.  And they all got to wear that huge baseball cap to cover their head  because their head kind of gets real big.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, I'm a normal kid.  I like skateboarding.  And I go, well, why don't you – we brought a skateboard in for you.  Would you people like to see this freak skateboard?  Yeah, I'd like to see it.  Perhaps he'll fall and snap that twig leg of his. 
[03:01:30]  Maury has him doing things.  And the one that I saw that made me just go, oh, this guy is despicable,  was when he had the miniature Pajeria kids.  They were smaller than normal.  They were like midget Pajeria kids.  Are you going to talk about the hide-and-seek game?  We're going to play hide-and-seek in my office.  Kids, you want to play hide-and-seek?  So he counts, you know, he counts to, I don't know, 20 or something like that,  and turns around and he goes, where are you?  And he starts looking in his drawers of his desk and on the shelves, his bookshelves, 
[03:02:00]  and he finds one sitting there like a bookend.  I found you, Amy.  And he picks her up.  It's like he's picking up a doll.  And one of them was hidden behind Ben's phone.  It's all pissed off as he eats his apple.  This show just stinks.  And one was hiding in his waste paper basket, in his garbage pail. 
[03:02:30]  And he's bringing him out.  He videotaped all this like it was supposed to be a before-the-show little event  because he just hangs out with the freaks.  Yeah, yeah, sure he does.  He's the best.  And when we had him on our show at NEW, we started goofing on him about it,  and he completely admitted it.  Yeah, he fessed up.  He fessed up.  He knows what he's doing.  He knows he's having these people on because it's a freak show.  The modern-day side show.  The progeria kids, though, that's just.  Yeah, yeah, when I'm out, you know, I do the things normal kids do. 
[03:03:00]  I like swimming.  I like bicycling.  I like skateboarding, rollerblading.  You just look like, oh, stop it.  You're freaking everyone out.  All you like doing is ruining family photos.  That should be your hobby.  Stupid.  Being the embarrassing explanation people have to give every time you walk in  and ruin a birthday party like some three-foot-tall grandfather in your awful  Red Sox hat.  Oh, Ben comes running in. 
[03:03:30]  Someone say Red Sox?  Oh.  All right, let's hit the phones here and say hi to Jimmy in Staten Island.  Jimmy, what's up?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Listen, I love the Mori shows when they have the pregnancy test.  Yeah.  And they got that Puerto Rican whore who's got like eight tests.  She still can't find out who the fucking father of a kid is.  And she goes running off the stage crying and he follows her.  She comes over.  Don't cry.  We'll find out who you fuck, you fat child.  Now live your fucking ass off.  Because how do you not know how many guys did you fuck to have this kid? 
[03:04:00]  And you don't know them.  You don't know.  He loves the paternity test now.  That's kind of a new thing he's been doing the past couple of years.  He has people come on and they don't know who's the baby daddy.  And he does a paternity test.  And, yeah, like this guy's saying, the woman always runs out and Mori runs backstage, camera in tow,  and just sits there with his arm around.  It's okay.  This is all for the best.  We're going to get that baby the care and love. 
[03:04:30]  You're such a good mother.  Back out on stage.  All right.  Yeah, let's get the scumbag out here.  Right.  Let him confront this whore.  But you're a good whore.  They come out walking out.  You don't know me.  You don't know me.  Yeah, we've all seen that one.  Right.  Are people still watching those shows in general?  I don't know.  I thought they had their run.  I gave up quite a while ago.  I think reality TV has hurt them in a way because it's another place to just look at awful, uninteresting people.  So it's like the whole thing is reality. 
[03:05:00]  It's lost its novel.  Oh, reality show.  Fox is coming up with a doozy.  I saw an ad for it last night.  They just have no conscience whatsoever anymore.  It's a show.  The setup is kind of like one of those shows where you pick a mate.  They have a girl and they have a bunch of men and they stand on the steps of the mansion.  And the girl is there picking and choosing based on relationships she has with these guys over the course of the series. 
[03:05:30]  But the twist on this one is the woman, girl, lost contact with her father when she was very young.  And she's got these father issues.  Of course, she wants to reunite with her father.  She hasn't been able to find him or he didn't want to get in touch or something.  Well, Fox, all their wisdom, came up with a show where they now have the father with five or six other men.  And she has to now maybe choose or decide which one is her father based on their relationships that develop over the course of this. 
[03:06:00]  What did Fox name it?  Who's Your Daddy?  Who's Your Daddy is the new show.  Wow.  Yeah.  Find your father.  And all the guys have to act like the father.  Like the father.  Then all they showed in the promo was like, I'm your father.  I'm your father.  Me as your father.  So, all right, you could write one off. 
[03:06:30]  It's not going to be one of those PC shows where they've got to add in the black guy.  It would be funny if she finally discovered who her father was by smelling every crotch  and recognizing the one from that one night back in 1974 before he left.  Oh, my God.  Why?  I don't know.  Why not?  You always have to take the left turn off the highway.  Because my remark had no less dignity than that awful show they're doing.  Exactly.  Could you men not shave for a week and try to kiss me on the mouth with whiskey breath?  All right.  Repeat after me.  I'll kill your puppy if you tell anyone. 
[03:07:00]  All right.  Hey, we got Tommy Chong outside the studio.  We should really take a quick break and get him in here, right?  Get him in here.  That's for sure.  All right.  In honor of Tommy Chong coming on the show today, a little ditty we used to play here.  Just a joint full of cannabis helps the medicine go down. 
[03:07:30]  Makes me feel good right away.  Now, every time that I am sick, a big fat doobie does the trick.  I find my bong and suck it till I'm well.  Because Proposition 215 makes Smokin' Reefer really keen.  Some hash, some weed is all I really need.  And a bag only costs a truffins.  Because a joint full of cannabis helps the medicine go down. 
[03:08:00]  I'm gonna go downtown where my dealer can be found.  Just a joint full of cannabis helps the medicine go down.  Makes me feel good right away.  Now, when I have a cold or flu, a bag of Mary Jane will do.  And pretty soon, I'm higher than a kite.  I take a puff.  I take a hit.  My doctor gets some real good shit.  Who needs a pill? 
[03:08:30]  I talk when I get here.  Now, I can really use a Twinkie.  Cause a joint full of cannabis helps the medicine go down.  I'm gonna go downtown where my dealer can be found.  Just a joint full of cannabis helps the medicine go down.  Makes me feel good right away.  I'm so stoned.  It's like punch sound, woman scream, opium amp.

[03:09:30]  This holiday season, give the gift of XM.  It's an Opie and Anthony Wow Sticker Stop.  This Wednesday at 7 a.m. Pacific Time.  Get to 906 West 223rd Street on the southwest corner of 223rd and Vermont Streets in Los Angeles, California.  And pick up your Wow Stickers.  Whoa!  Those aren't real.  Yes, they are.  One block from the 223rd Street exit from the South 110 Freeway.  In the same lot as Sir Speedy and Mako.  Once again, here is how it should sound. 
[03:10:00]  The Wow Sticker Stop, brought to you by your pals at the Opie and Anthony Show.  I think very often college acts don't give their very best shot to colleges.  And I remember I played a college up in New England with the electric flag.  Bowdoin College, about 2,500 fairly conservative students, nice guys, homecoming, whatever.  The deans were there.  And in the middle of the concert, Mike Bloomfield's on the guitar goes,  Holy man, this sound system sucks, man.  Just a minute, man, it sucks.  You get us a new sound system, we'll wait, okay, man? 
[03:10:30]  Because that sucks.  And the deans goes, well, we'll see what we can do about that.  One, two.  One, two your ass, man.  It's very nice of a flag.  I played a lot of unusual school.  I played the Air Force Academy last spring.  And a lot of people are snotty about it.  Oh, it must have been something.  They were very nice.  They were a good audience.  They want to be like other college students.  They were very orderly.  And they were very attentive. 
[03:11:00]  And I remember at the concert, it was like,  Prepare to laugh, ho!  Laugh, ho!  Prepare for Mr. Klein's next joke.  We're all, we can come out of this world.  Set up punchline, laugh, ho!  Together, you know.  The dumb shit you see on the news.  Like these women newscasters that want to go into men's locker rooms.  I mean, look at what they're making an issue out of, these ugly fucking dogs. 
[03:11:30]  That's what that prick fucking look is.  That's what they do.  They look at prick.  They went to school for 10 years, so they had the license to walk into a locker room and look at prick, right?  Did you see the one that said they molested her or something?  Did you ever see anything so fucking ugly in your life?  So she's pissed off.  She spent thousands of bucks.  Now she can't even look at prick.  Dumb prick-looker fucking bitch bastard.  There's more important things in this world than prick-looking. 
[03:12:00]  That's what I think!  Ugh, shit.  It's the O&A virus.  XM 202.  XM news, talk, sports, and information.  It's everything, all the time.  Let's go to Eric real fast in New Mexico. 
[03:12:30]  Eric, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Hey.  New listener here.  All right.  I want to say thanks for the pre-play action.  I heard you guys a couple months ago on the Comedy Channel, a little sit-down with Sonny.  Oh, okay.  And got exposed to that.  But I'm wondering, a lot of phrases and words and this and that that you guys use.  I'm kind of catching up on most of them, but I wanted to know if maybe you guys could post 
[03:13:00]  some of the stuff on your website or whatnot.  I think it might be up on foundyourmusic.com or opiananthony.com.  There is an Opie and Anthony dictionary.  Yeah.  One in particular you need to know real fast?  What was the one?  What is it?  Wood floor?  Wood flooring?  What is that?  A wood floor is a girl that shaves everything down below.  Ah.  Yeah.  It's smooth like a wood floor.  Yeah.  Anything else?  Balloon knot?  No, that's good.  You guys are great.  And it's about one of two stations I listen to on XM. 
[03:13:30]  That's it.  What's the other one?  Comedy Channel.  150.  All right.  Thank you.  Yep.  All right, guys.  Have a good one.  Let's bring in Tommy Chong, man.  Sure.  From Cheech and Chong.  Spent some time in jail, I think.  Yes.  You think.  I think.  There he is.  Of course we know.  Legend.  He's a legend.  Hey, guys.  Hey, what's up, Tommy?  What's up, man?  That was the most intense sit-down of a celebrity in our history of broadcasting, I think, man. 
[03:14:00]  It looked like you were going to kill us.  Why?  No, you were just getting settled, and it was very, uh...  Oh, I'm taking my time, you mean?  It's okay that you took your time.  You just had a way about it.  It was good.  I'm an old guy.  Not really.  You're not that old.  I'm a made comic.  Yeah?  A made comic.  A made comic.  I made my bones while you were doing open mics.  That's right.  That's right.  And we belong to a secret society. 
[03:14:30]  So how's everything?  Who's Opie?  Um, me?  The one that looks kind of like a...  Opie?  Or like kind of...  I thought...  For some reason, I thought it was for opium or something.  The Opium and Anthony show.  Hey, well, that's not a bad idea.  Opium and...  Some days...  Some days, people do call up and go, the Opium and...  What do you want, Opium?  Yeah, and then, uh, Anthony, and of course...  Anthony would be the Italian-looking guy.  Yeah, and then Jimmy Norton.  And there's Jim Norton over there.  So you're in town.  We were just talking before the show.  Of course, I went on and said hello to Tommy, doing the marijuana logs in the village. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, what's that about?  It's the only job I could get after I got out of jail.  The only job I was offered.  Are you kidding?  Yeah.  Well...  A lot of people were pissed off that you went to jail?  Why?  Why did I get...  No, I...  Why did I go to jail, or why are they pissed off?  Well, we...  It's like, why wouldn't they give you a job?  Going to jail for...  Everyone knows you went to jail for something stupid.  Well, Disneyland and things like that.  You know, I was supposed to do a voiceover gig at Disney for one of their movies. 
[03:15:30]  Now, Disney won't touch you because...  Oh, they just...  Oh, that's such crap.  They just...  I got a call from Goofy, you know.  You're back.  Nope.  You're not on.  I'm sure you're probably, you know, tired of the story, but to fill the listeners in,  what happened, like...  What happened...  What happened was my son had a company that sold water bongs, water pipes, that had my  face on it, and I used to help him promote them, you know, when I would go around the 
[03:16:00]  country doing private, or private, comedy clubs.  Mm-hmm.  You know, my wife and I have a show, and, you know, Chong, and the family's stoned, and  we'd go out and have a good time.  And we would sell the pipes at the shows.  And autograph them and stuff, right?  Yeah, autograph them and stuff.  Yeah, why not?  And then we had an art show in L.A., and it was, you know, art, like in a gallery and  that, you know, so a lot of collectors bought them.  And, but the DEA was on my tail. 
[03:16:30]  I didn't know about it, but...  The DEA?  Yeah.  Because of bongs?  Because of water pipes, yeah.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  And they followed...  Weren't they showing up and, like, taking pictures of you and stuff like that?  Yeah, they followed me around.  They followed, you know, we, like, in Arlington, Texas, they followed me there in the undercover  operation.  And it was really weird, because you, there were obviously cops.  You know, I seen them, I said, oh.  But, you know, in my mind, I wasn't doing anything illegal.  You know, if I was, you know, how come... 
[03:17:00]  I thought you were allowed to sell the water bongs and all that.  At the time, at the time we were.  And, but these guys, you know, they had their undercover things and acted like hippies, you  know, you know, that look, you know, like linebackers with headbands.  You can spot them, right, Tommy?  Tommy's like, that's a narc.  That's like, it sounds like one of your old movies.  Yeah.  Remember that one?  Stacy Keach?  Yeah, it was just like that.  Stacy Keach with Danko?  It's still following you around.  And then, and then one of the girls that worked at the head shop, she's got a big DEA t-shirt 
[03:17:30]  on, and she's kind of walking around with him.  So, so the, you know, the, the spirit was all obviously trying to tell me something, you  know.  Yeah.  These were narcs.  And so they, they, they hauled me aside and outside, you know, there's a big lineup for  autographs, you know, the lineup went about three, three blocks, you know, just to get  my autograph and there's, they're, you know, they're saying, oh, you know, we drove a long  way to come, you know, to get a picture and, and want to talk to you, you know, and these 
[03:18:00]  pipes now, they're, they're not just for tobacco, are they?  And I said, of course, like a dummy, I go, no, you know, he says, well, what are they,  what are they really?  Oh, no, Tommy.  And so I said, well.  He stepped into a left hook.  For pot, of course.  Yeah.  He said, no, why, why are the, why are these better for smoking pot than, say, a normal  pot?  And I said, well, because, you know, it filters the, uh, the impurities and, and they put that  all on tape, you know, and so they had that. 
[03:18:30]  Like you're talking about something that is a threat to national security.  Oh.  I mean.  Well, you know, it'd figure out the cost.  They, they, they, they said, uh, some, someone threw out a figure like something like, uh,  $50 million.  How much armor would that buy for the troops in Iraq, you know?  Yeah.  Instead of chasing you around with your, with, with your bongs.  Me and, me and, uh, all the, the glassblowers from Oregon, you know, they got, they got popped.  What is the actual crime?  The crime was shipping, uh, paraphernalia through the mails to Pennsylvania. 
[03:19:00]  That was.  To Pennsylvania.  Yeah.  Two, two states that, that, uh, will prosecute, uh, paraphernalia laws as, uh,  Iowa and, um, Pennsylvania.  Now, I'm sure you probably tried to pursue this.  Isn't there some kind of, I don't know, saying that it is art and it's artwork and, and what  people use it for?  You could use a faucet to smoke pot at it.  Absolutely.  And, and, and the, um, the, the thing, you know, that, the law that it broke, you know, 
[03:19:30]  it covers everything.  Um, for instance, they even got those little alligator clips that you can wear a radio shack.  The little rose clip, right?  Yeah.  They call, they said that's considered drug paraphernalia.  So if I shipped, uh, uh, alligator clip through the mail, technically, you see, they could bust  me, but I had a, I had a great case, you know, the art thing, the whole thing.  I had a great case.  So they threatened me with my, uh, to, to go after my son and my wife. 
[03:20:00]  Oh boy.  And they, the feds said that we will get them.  The feds.  Scumbags.  Yeah.  They said, they said there, they would put my son and my wife in jail.  I would probably walk.  He says, but you'd be visiting your son and your wife.  So you had to take the hit.  And so I took the hit, but I didn't mind, you know, I, it was, I was kind of torn between  it, but then I figured, you know, we, we, Cheech and I got a new movie coming up, you  know, we got, you know, and I'm on the marijuana logs and that, you know, so I needed the  publicity.  How much time can you look at that? 
[03:20:30]  It's like a nine month reality publicity stunt.  Yeah.  It doesn't hurt.  It doesn't hurt you in the long run.  Nine months you're spending that.  Nine months.  How was your time?  Was it, uh, it was great.  It was enjoyable.  It was great.  I had one bad, I had one bad half hour and that was the first night I was in jail and  when they turned, I could hear the door being locked and, and I'm in, in a dormitory in  a little cubicle with, uh, two other, uh, inmates.  Animals.  And, uh, and the rest of it, there's like 250 people in this one or yeah, 250 people 
[03:21:00]  in this dormitory and the noise, you know, you can hear people snoring and farting and  sleeping.  And that was the only bad, I had a sort of claustrophobic moment.  Sure.  Because I'm in a bunk and I'm, you know, next to a cement wall and it's about, you know,  about two and a half feet wide, steel, little plastic mattress.  And you're like, here I am for nine months.  And here I am.  Yeah.  And that was it. 
[03:21:30]  And then, then something came over me, you know, sort of this sort of warmth came over  me and it was like, it was the guy on the bunk above you peeing.  Relax.  Unfortunately.  No, I'll tell you, you're, you're, when you're in, in that kind of situation, you're  down with the nicest, sweetest people I've ever met.  Ever met.  Yeah.  Because if you step out of line, at least a little bit, there's no, there's no gate  around.  I mean, there's no fence around the place.  There's a chalk line around the whole perimeter. 
[03:22:00]  Like on the honor system.  And if you step out of line, you lose that privilege.  And so everybody just tiptoes around, smiles, everybody's sweet.  What do you do to keep busy?  Oh, all, all sorts of things.  Well, the first, I was there about a week and everything takes time.  You know, like you, uh, they give you like a month before they even assign you a job.  So, you know, like with us, we'd be like, okay, I'll see you tomorrow.  We'll do it.  But in prison, it's like next month.  So, so time stretches up. 
[03:22:30]  So I, I read a lot.  I, um, watched television a lot.  I worked in the garden, but what, what happened?  And I, I hooked up with the only real criminal I found in the place for this guy had been  down about two or three times, tattoos all over.  He was like head of the Aryan nation at one time, you know, he's a cool guy, very funny  guy.  And he was a big Cheech and Chong fan.  So he knew all the bits and, and he was kind of heavy, like really, you know, been pushing 
[03:23:00]  iron, you know, all the time he'd been in jail.  So he was the only like real gangster or, you know, criminal looking guy I found there.  And I met him because I'm a tango dancer, you know, so I was taking tango.  I'm still doing a tango dance with the guy.  Yeah.  So what happened?  I'm a, I'm out on the field practicing my tango and these big rough bikers, you know,  they're watching me.  Why do you ever practice tango in the prison?  I would say.  What balls.  Really?  It's like the injured gazelle. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah.  So Steve, Steve, uh, he, he, he, he had to say something.  So he says, Hey, Chong, he says, you don't have to dance alone.  I'll dance with you.  You know, big, everybody goes, ah, so I walked over to him and I grabbed him.  I said, come on, let's go.  And he jumped like a little girl.  He said, ah, he got away.  Like, you know, everybody's so homophobic.  He ran around.  I said, come on, what's the matter?  You don't want to dance with me? 
[03:24:00]  And from that day on, we, we become the best of friends and, and he just sort of guided  me through the whole, the whole thing.  What were a lot of guys in for?  Just minor stuff or?  Mostly white collar stuff.  I was down, I counted eight doctors.  Wow.  There's eight doctors, lawyers, there's, there's a Reagan speech writer, a guy that used to  write speeches for Reagan.  And so it's not a movie at all.  Right.  And you're down with like some of the most entertaining con men. 
[03:24:30]  Like these are confidence men who scammed millions off people.  And you know, you're done with these guys.  These guys are the most entertaining, sweetest people in the world.  That's their job.  They're used to doing that.  Yeah.  That's their job.  I mean, people's confidence by smiling, being nice.  First guy I met, uh, I wouldn't say his name, but he, I ended up in his, his cubicle because  he conned the lady into saying that he knew me on the street and he knew enough about me 
[03:25:00]  that he said, yeah, I met you at a party, blah, blah, blah.  And he went on.  And I said, I felt like I knew him.  And he fooled me for at least three months, three months that I really thought.  And then, then his story started falling apart.  I could, I could feel, you know, I got onto it, you know, and Steve, my dog, the, the,  the big biker, he, he, he would, he taught me all the different things in prison, you  know, you know, how people lie and how people, you know, do what they do. 
[03:25:30]  It was, it was incredible.  No one started any physical confrontations with you, did they?  Oh, not a bit.  Are you kidding?  And what about the sex, the sex thing?  Oh, that's all.  That's myth.  It's myth.  I mean, there's gays.  There's gays.  No, we were, we were, we were talking about, um, prison pussy.  I did yesterday, the pocket pussies and stuff.  Oh, what you do, you know, take care of yourself.  That's a long time without, uh.  Well, first of all, they feed you stuff to keep your sexual urge non-existent.  Really?  It's in the food.  You know, the saltpeter, whatever it is.  So, so, so to begin with, you don't have any urges. 
[03:26:00]  Your sex drive goes down the curb.  Totally, totally.  Wow.  Uh, that's to begin with.  Second, there's nothing titillating in there.  You know, to, to, you know, Howard Stern is probably the most, uh, sexiest show, you  know, on, on television.  Yeah.  You don't have time.  I mean, we have female guards that look like gorillas, you know.  Right, right.  So that's a turn.  Yeah, I bet.  I mean, if you've been down a long, long time, you know, the happiest guys in there,  uh, were the gay guys, you know, because. 
[03:26:30]  That makes perfect sense.  They're at home.  Yeah.  But they hung to themselves, you know, and of course, there was a few of the older gay  guys would hit on the younger, you know, fish that would come in because one guy was  a barber and when he'd cut the young guy's hair, he'd kind of straddle them.  Oh.  But the young guys, you know, I mean.  You need to put this in your mouth so I can put your hair.  But, but, but it's not Hollywood at all.  No.  And not Hollywood at all. 
[03:27:00]  Not even at least a little bit.  It sounds like you really enjoyed your time in prison.  Oh, man, it was a, it was.  It was a good experience?  I mean, I'm sure you didn't want to go there, but then.  Well, I figured out, yeah, I'm a writer, I'm a comedian, you know, and I'm a stoner,  you know, so I learned all, and then I had to take a drug course.  Really?  I had to take all these courses, you know, I had to go to school, I had to go to get my  GED, you know, I've never graduated high school, and so there's a lot, you know, if you're  in prison, you have to take the courses.  Wow.  Of course, I failed it.  You know, the math, I couldn't do the math. 
[03:27:30]  That's great.  I tried, I really tried.  I studied.  Really?  But the math is holding you up?  Well, it's algebra.  Yeah.  And can anybody here do algebra?  Not anymore.  Yeah.  Not anymore.  And then they said you could use calculators, and so I learned how to use a calculator, but  then when the test came, they let me use it for like five minutes, and they yanked it  away, and I was like, ah, you know, couldn't do it.  Man.  I worked in the garden there.  That must have made some jokes, too, you know?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, well, National Enquirer got a hold of the pictures that my con man cellmate sent 
[03:28:00]  him, and then, so the garden was great, you know, because I could get away.  And then I ended up hanging with the American Indians.  They have a sweat lodge.  That's a, what do you call it, a religious rite that every prison has to have, a sweat  lodge for the American Indians, and it's very cool.  Gee, really?  Yeah.  Everyone.  What do you do there? 
[03:28:30]  Sweat.  You just sit there and sweat with Indians.  Well, it's a ceremony.  Yeah.  It's a very ancient religious ceremony, and it's very cool.  Not cool.  It's hot as hell, you know.  What it is, it's a lodge that you have to get on your hands and knees and crawl into,  and you go clockwise around, and you sit down.  There's a lodge leader, and no one else speaks except the leader, and he conducts a ceremony, 
[03:29:00]  and then the hot rocks are brought in, symbolizing the center of the universe, or the center of  the earth, which is hot, molten rock, and then they chant and pour water on the rocks, and  it gets, and then they pull the hot, they seal it off, so it's like totally sealed, and  then you sit in there.  How bad did you want to be high in there?  Well, you know what happens, it's so hot.  It's the center of the universe, dude.  Yeah.  Have you ever been in a situation, and you talk about claustrophobia. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  When you're in like that, they're in a situation like that, they're in it, your ego just goes  out the door, or you go out the door.  But it's a macho thing, you know, you can't leave, because all the other guys are, you  know, you have to sit it through.  It's a warrior's thing.  How long is it that you're actually sweating like that?  They're called doors.  You might, the longest door would be 45 minutes, and the shortest would be 20. 
[03:30:00]  I leave, it depends on the chanting.  But what happens, you go into a state where you lose track of everything, but, because  you can't see anything, you're, it's like you're totally blind in the heat, and it's  very, you get.  Sounds pretty wild.  You lose, you lose whatever toxins, you know, spiritual toxins that you have, it disappears,  and then you sweat, and then you get to like a near death state toward the end. 
[03:30:30]  And when you crawl out, you know, a lot of people couldn't walk, they just fall, and  then you lay there and sort of recuperate, and then your soul or your spirit sort of comes  back into your body, and it takes a while, and then you're okay.  But once a week.  Wow.  That's pretty wild, huh?  Once a week.  Yeah.  Once a week.  For three months.  Damn.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, there was, and time went by real fast. 
[03:31:00]  I bet.  Once I started sweating.  Yeah.  So, so, you know, all that Hollywood crap, you know, about, you know, the gang, you know,  plotting, and, you know, the gangsters.  Come on, Louie.  The hard time.  Come on, Louie, you know, you distract them, you know, all that crap, you know.  I mean, there was stuff going down, like people had cell phones, and, you know, you could  get a year in jail if they caught you with it, you know.  Wow, really?  Yeah, I mean, any, any infraction they would throw you. 
[03:31:30]  Just add more time on it.  Well, there was two, there was a camp, and then there was a real maximum security prison.  You want to stay in the camp.  Yeah, you want to stay in the camp.  The MAX has barbed wire, and it's loud, because mostly Spanish illegals, like a thousand of  them, all speak in Spanish, screaming at each other.  So you want to stay out of there.  You want to stay out of there.  Yeah.  I mean, and, and every, no, no respect. 
[03:32:00]  Mm-hmm.  You know, like, like the heavy prisons, there's a respect factor.  That's why my buddy, Steve, you know, he hated it over there, because no one would, you  know, he's a white supremacy leader, but no one cares, you know.  It's tough being tough, and no one cares about it.  Yeah.  So what was, what was the first thing you did when you got out?  I went to Starbucks.  Did you?  Yeah, my wife and a guy that did a biography on me, television thing, they took me right 
[03:32:30]  to Starbucks.  I got a coffee, because you can't, you know, the coffee in jail, the food, and everything  in jail is horrible.  I mean, to the point, coffee tastes like warmed up dishwater, you know.  Ugh.  And, and, and you're not allowed to relax and eat.  You, you, you, you come in with your food, you, you gobble it down, and then you leave.  You take what you can't eat, dump it in the thing, and throw the, put the, the tray, you 
[03:33:00]  eat off trays with plastic spoons.  You're not allowed a knife.  Spoons.  And people have been eating like that for like 15, 20 years.  I mean, people have done time.  It doesn't sound like much fun.  It's not fun.  I mean, I'm sure you, you made the best of it, but probably not fun.  Well, what happens, you're in a, everybody's in the same boat, right?  Mm-hmm.  And so your level of, of, of expecting good times varies, you know. 
[03:33:30]  Now you get to watch television for an extra hour.  That's a big, whoa.  Yeah.  Or you have a Christmas tree that, that, for Christmas, you know, these guys made a Christmas,  they made a snowman out of toilet paper.  It was pretty funny because the, the guards were, weren't too pleased.  The counselors, we had women counselors and they, and they were, they would, they would  walk around with suits and look at you and call you in their office and ask you questions 
[03:34:00]  like, you know, are you keeping yourself clean and you've behaved and all that.  It's like school.  And then you have to stand up, be counted every four hours.  Right.  You have to, they find you wherever you are or you, you have to be in a certain spot and  then you stand up and you wait for the guards to walk by and count you.  When, when, when you got out, did you, uh, did you find out like who your friends were  kind of thing?  Yeah.  Before you went in, were there any people that after you were in there kind of steered 
[03:34:30]  clear of you?  Yeah.  Disney.  Disney.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, that, well, you know, with me, you know, I was like, you know, I was like  a big hero inside, outside, everywhere I go now, you know, people, it was terrible what  happened to you and all that.  No, I had, what happened, it's not so much you find out who your friends are, you find  out who your friends, who, who people, there's certain people react.  You're like, um, uh, what's, uh, Pat Morita, you know, the karate kid? 
[03:35:00]  Yeah, sure.  Mr. Miyago.  Mm-hmm.  He called me the night before I went in and it was like getting a call from Mr. Miyago telling  me, you, you'll be okay.  You'll be fine.  You know, just want you to know, you know, good luck and all that, all that, all that  good stuff, you know.  Good thing you didn't think of him when he was in Happy Days, that would have been a far  less comforting call.  Don't bend over.  No, who else? 
[03:35:30]  Yeah, I got some interesting non-calls, you know, from, you know, I don't want to mention  any names, you know, and I won't.  But there's some, there were, there were some acquaintances of mine that could have done  something.  Arnold, for instance, you know, Schwarzenegger, you know, I've smoked a joint with Arnold,  you know, I've known Arnold for years when he first got off the boat, you know.  He liked his pot, huh?  Oh, yeah.  And we, we, we smoked up a lot, you know, and then all of a sudden he had amnesia when 
[03:36:00]  it came to me, you know.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He couldn't remember, couldn't remember.  Well, now he's the governor of California.  Yeah.  He can't be telling people he was friends with you.  Good morning.  I mean, I'm, I mean, I'm saying that as him.  I mean, that's, it's kind of pathetic.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  I'm a police officer.  It's like, yeah.  Hey, uh, you know, how about helping me out, Arnold?  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Hey, I'm going to jail, man.  Quiet.  Quiet. 
[03:36:30]  No help from, uh, from Arnold.  Not at all.  When he needed pot, he knew who to talk to, right?  Well, you know, and Cheech and I actually performed at one of his concert, contests that  he ran, you know, and I got a poster and everything, you know, and, um, no, we were, you know,  and then when, uh, Up and Smoke, you know, our movies came out, he was struggling, you  know.  Sure.  And then, and then it was like, well, he was friends then.  He knew me then.  But Arnold's always has been like a celebrity whore, you know. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because I was, I remember being in the gym and we used to, a couple of us, you know,  did movies and that.  We used to count how many people he had talked to before he talked to us and that would determine  where you were at on the scale, you know.  A little Arnold seniority.  Yeah, a little Arnold thing, you know, the scale.  But the funniest Arnold story, this one girl that used to work out, um, looked almost identical  to Demi Moore.  And she come over to me one day and she goes, Arnold thinks I'm Demi Moore. 
[03:37:30]  And I said, why do you say that?  She goes, he's training me.  He thinks I'm Demi.  I said, well, did you tell him?  And she goes, no.  He trained her for like three weeks.  And then one day he found out, I guess he met Demi Moore at a party or something.  And he come in, he wouldn't talk to her.  And then he's not training her anymore.  He's a dummy.  What a dick.  He's just the worst.  What film are you doing with Cheech?  You said you're doing another movie.  That's great, man.  Yeah, we were working on it as a reunion movie before I, when I got busted. 
[03:38:00]  It was kind of funny because I ended up having to give Cheech all my bongs that the feds never  found.  So Cheech has got them all.  So how do you smoke your pot now?  I don't smoke.  No, no more, huh?  I quit.  I get tested.  Wow.  I'm on, you know.  How does that feel?  Supervised releases.  Was that a rough thing to do?  Not smoke pot anymore?  Not at all.  No?  Not at all.  I never smoked that much.  Really? 
[03:38:30]  A lot of it was an act.  Yeah, yeah.  I, you know, toke up a little bit.  Any tips for the kids?  Because now we can't smoke our pot with our bongs.  Maybe hollow out a carrot?  What are we going to do now?  I do a joke.  You ruined it for everybody.  I do a joke.  I do, yeah.  They figure, you know, that we're going to quit because we can't smoke them with a bong.  I said, when you've got good pot and no way to smoke it, you turn into MacGyver in the  heart.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a good joke.  That's how I used to be as a kid, man.  Anything.  An apple.  Toilet roll. 
[03:39:00]  Yep.  Toilet paper roll.  I was talking about how he did it.  Yeah, I was going to say the faucet.  He just took my kitchen faucet off and it already had a screen in it.  Well, you know, a guy in prison, you know, a grower slash dealer, you know, he told me  the healthiest way is to take the bud and dip it in honey and just eat, eat it.  Really?  Yeah.  That's the healthiest way.  I've been sober for 18 years.  Do you have any idea how good that just sounded, the way he described that, to dip a bud in  honey and just eat it?  Yeah.  Jesus, that sounds appetizing.  That's the best because then you save your lungs, you know. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah.  But you've got to be careful because you can't tell how much you're getting, so you can take  a little, you know, you take too much of the stuff they got now and, you know.  It gets you high though, right?  It'll put you away for a while.  Yeah.  It'll get you too high, so be very careful.  I won't do it.  Yeah.  That's the healthiest way.  But I haven't smoked.  I quit the day they busted me.  Yeah, I guess that's a good day to quit.  Yeah.  That was good.  But when I was in jail, about halfway through my, they hadn't tested me though.  I was in there for about three months and then this guy, this guy, you know, another 
[03:40:00]  inmate walked up to me.  I knew him.  He was from the Haight-Ashbury area, era, you know.  And he was in there for a long time.  He was on the back end of a 20-year sentence.  And he walked up to, Steve and I were sitting in the middle of the soccer field watching the  sunset.  That was what I used to do for three months.  And he walked up with a joint and he splashed the joint at me. 
[03:40:30]  He goes, hey, do you mind if I, do you want to smoke up with me?  And of course, Steve, you know, told me, get the, out of here, you know.  And so the guy left.  Next day, I got tested first time.  So it was a little set up there.  Wow.  Would have been a thrill for the guy though to smoke a dube with you.  Yeah, it would have been a thrill for the feds to put me back, you know, put me in the  hole.  Steve, nothing better to do but go after you for selling bongs.  It's so irritating with terrorism and all that shit.  Yeah, bongs.  They're worried about Tommy Chong selling bongs.  What's a bong going to do? 
[03:41:00]  God, that aggravating.  Well, I felt like, you know, when David Copperfield does his magic and he does a little thing  with his hand to distract you from what he's really doing, that's what I felt like.  You know, the bongs going down and all that stuff, you know, in the meantime, you know,  Bush and them are attacking Iraq and, you know, messing up the country that way.  A little diversion.  A little voting fraud going on, you know, a little, little, all this stuff going on.  And, you know, that's, that's really what it was, what it turned out to be.  You were getting a lot of shout outs at award shows and stuff. 
[03:41:30]  Free Tommy Chong.  Oh, yeah.  Like a lot of people yelling that out.  Pretty funny to watch.  Yeah, we're, we're going to Aspen for, uh, some award and I guess in.  February, I think is the festival, right?  Is it February?  I think so.  Yeah, February.  We'll be in Aspen.  Cheech and I are going to get the, uh, I'm going to get the convict of the comedian of  the year award.  I got asked to be on the Christmas show when I was in there by the gay barber.  And, was he straddling you? 
[03:42:00]  No.  He was trimming your beard.  One of the greatest things about, I don't know, I got a vibe or something, but I don't  get hit on by gay guys.  No?  No.  Did you used to?  I got some kind of, no, never, never have, never have.  I got hit on one time at the YMCA, one time.  And then, and I was really shocked because it was in the, in the, in the dressing room  and, you know, the guy, hey, do you want to get together later?  And I looked at him and then he reached in his locker and pulled out the thickest pair 
[03:42:30]  of glasses I've ever seen.  Then he changed his mind.  You were feeling good about yourself for a second.  Yeah, he took one look and said, oh, sorry, I thought you were someone else.  You were two in the gay community.  That's hilarious.  They're all asking where Cheech is.  Yeah, and the marijuana logs, I, I, I teased the guys, you know, the other loggers, you  know, Doug and Tony.  Yeah, what is this show all about?  I, I don't think we really explained it. 
[03:43:00]  Okay, the marijuana logs is a takeoff, a spoof on the vagina.  Oh, okay, sure.  Okay, where three, instead of three women getting up talking about their vaginas, three  guys get up and talk about pot in the same, same sort of like hushed tones, you know, reverent  tones and Tony and Doug and this other guy wrote it and I, I come in, you know, with, you  know, it's perfect for me and so, so every, you know, the light comes on, one guy, he talks 
[03:43:30]  and then the blackout and then the light comes on, another guy, he does his monologue.  You know, it's really funny and it's great, it's a great spoof and that, but I, I kind  of tease the guys, you know, I do a little, you know, well, they do a little good stuff  but it's kind of gay, you know, and I sort of mention it to them, it's kind of funny.  Yeah, and it's at the Actors Playhouse?  On 7th, yeah.  100, 7th Avenue, South Shore, and how did they get tickets?  I guess your phone, Actors Playhouse.  Yeah, let's try that, the Actors Playhouse, look the number up and, maybe we got the number 
[03:44:00]  And how long are you doing this for?  How long are you actually going to be in that for?  Well, I'm going to do it this week in New York and then we're going to put it on the road  in February and it's going to go all over the country.  Actually, there's a website, www.potshow.com.  Potshow.com?  Yeah.  Oh, for all the info.  A lot of people want to talk to Tommy Chong.  Let's go to Rick in Jersey.  Rick, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, man.  We're hanging with Tommy Chong.  Tommy, you rock, man.  Thanks, man.  Hey, they say when Dudley Moore did Arthur, they tried to seem drunk and sober and see 
[03:44:30]  what worked better.  Were you guys smoking a lot during the movies or no?  We, both teaching that, you know, we smoked up so much before the movies, we sort of had  this body memory thing going, you know.  It's not hard to do.  But what we did, we both found role models, characters that we could pattern ourselves after.  And when Cheech and I were, we were doing sort of improv theater in Vancouver, the guy 
[03:45:00]  that I had working the lights, it was a club that I owned or my family owned, and I had  this stoner kind of, his name was Strawberry, doing the lights.  And he was one of those guys that would, if the bit bombed, he'd tell you about it, you  know.  He'd say, wow, man.  They never laughed.  Whoa, you guys sucked on that last one, man.  And his voice just stuck in my head. 
[03:45:30]  And so when we did the movies, I needed a stoner and it became Strawberry.  Yeah, right on.  Hey, don't look at his face, man.  Strawberry.  Yeah.  The guy with the thing on his face.  I wasn't looking at his face, man.  We all do that line, though, when you see that guy that has something on him and his  face.  Let's go for it.  Frank, they were the most ridiculous movies, but entertaining as hell.  Hilarious.  What?  They built a truck out of pot and they're trying to drive it across. 
[03:46:00]  Well, the new one, the new one, you know, we got a working title of Grumpy Old Stoners,  but we got a, we got a, they got a fart mobile.  It runs on farts.  It should use Jimmy Norton.  Very nice.  The studio runs on farts every morning.  One of the funniest things I ever saw.  It's the coffee he drinks.  It's the smoothies and everything else he shoves into his gullet.  In the next movie, which is probably my favorite if I had to shoot, I would say next movie. 
[03:46:30]  I forget, I think he had soap in his mouth and you handed him piss and he drank the piss.  Oh, no, that's next, yeah, next movie.  Oh, my God.  This is pee, man.  God, is that funny.  That was my pre-trial probation officer's favorite bit.  Really?  Because they do pee tests all the time.  And, you know, I was going down with my sister's urine and he's drinking.  He thought I had, the soap was Coke, so he stole it, did a Scarface thing on it.  Yeah.  That's hilarious.  Let's say hi to Frank in Jersey.  Frank, what's up?  How are you doing? 
[03:47:00]  Good.  We're with Tommy Chong today.  I want to ask him about dipping pot in honey.  We talked about that, no?  Well, yeah.  I wanted to know how it works because I'm about to try it.  Just be very careful.  We were going to do stoner spelling bee in honor of you today.  Just be very, very careful you don't do too much.  Do a very...  I mean, like, how big of a piece do you think?  Oh, small.  Not M&M?  Smaller, smaller, smaller, smaller.  Smaller?  Like an M&M?  Yeah, yeah, even smaller.  All right, cool.  Just do the dog eating poison routine. 
[03:47:30]  Or a rat eating poison.  What they do, they eat a little bit and then they go off and see what happens.  Yeah.  And if it doesn't kill them, then they go eat the rest of it.  Nice.  Yeah, start small.  Yeah, start small.  All right.  All right, sounds good.  I'm going to go listen to myself in my sky by now.  All right, enjoy, mister.  Yeah, we're going to have to have you back because we do this bit called Stoner Spelling Bee.  We get these guys to get really high and then they have to spell words.  It would be an honor if he came back and played with us, man.  Yeah.  It'd be like a judge.  It's hilarious. 
[03:48:00]  I'm writing a book and I got a computer that has a spell correct.  Yeah.  And it gets pissed off at me.  Because of my spelling so bad.  The computer starts telling me.  You ass.  It starts spreading.  Taking a long time, you know.  What are you waiting for?  Yeah, yeah.  It's C-A-T, you ass.  Brian in Texas, what's up?  Yeah, hey, I just wanted to say, Tommy, you're great.  They never should have messed with you.  I kind of got in the same boat with you. 
[03:48:30]  I've been out 15 months today.  What were you doing?  Are you still on paper?  Oh, yeah.  I got a five-year sentence.  So you're doing five?  Yeah.  Well, everything's okay, though?  Oh, yeah, it's great, man.  I got out there, got straight.  Good for you.  Because it wasn't that hard to quit smoking, you know, like you said.  It's not, no.  No, no, no.  I mean, you go so long inside without doing it, it's nothing to do it once you're out.  And body memory takes over, you know. 
[03:49:00]  Oh, yeah.  You can feel the stone.  I still get the munchies.  You still get the munchies?  Oh, yeah.  All the time.  Yeah.  Because at a certain time of the night, all of a sudden, I find myself in front of a refrigerator  or wherever I'm at, and I'm just eating, like, mindlessly.  Oh, yeah.  It's hard.  All right, Brian.  Hang in there, okay?  All right.  Thank you.  We got John in D.C.  We're all over the country.  John, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey, John.  Hi, mister.  Ha, ha. 
[03:49:30]  Hey, what's up?  I wanted to ask Tommy about, you were talking about the celebrities who were really your  friends and who aren't your friends, and I was wondering what's going on with you and  Jay Leno, because you did his show after you got out, but supposedly he was disowning  you when you were in prison?  Well, no.  What happened, that was kind of a misunderstanding.  Oh, okay.  But Jay has, you know, because of his position, he has to, you know, be careful about the  corporate sponsors, and so he was kind of walking that tightrope, you know, until he 
[03:50:00]  found out that I, you know, the kind of charges that were so bogus and everything else, and  then he's been on my side ever since.  Oh, that's good.  And Jay and I have always hit it off well.  He just, there was a time when he said he didn't remember meeting me, and buddy.  Did you smoke pot with Jay Leno?  No.  No, Jay doesn't smoke at all, man.  No.  Doesn't seem like the type.  Unlike Arnold, who just bogards the joint all the time. 
[03:50:30]  You're smoking with him.  Tommy Chong, I need some pot.  It must have been fun.  Arnold German lips the joint.  Does he German lips the joint?  That is funny.  Did you ever have a falling out with Cheech?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, what was that about?  Because people know about it, but not a lot of people know what actually happened.  Because, of course, in the movies, you guys are pals and everything.  Well, no, Cheech quit. 
[03:51:00]  You know, he quit the act, and he didn't want to do Dopamera anymore.  No.  He wanted to act.  He wanted to be an actor.  And so, then I'm still doing comedy, so it was just so natural for me to zing him all  the time.  Yeah.  So, I used to, I had about a half hour of anti-Cheech jokes.  Really?  Him and Don Johnson, you know, when he was doing comedy.  Right, they're doing a show, yeah.  I had a song I used to sing, and it was pretty, he didn't laugh too hard at it, you know. 
[03:51:30]  No, he didn't find the humor in it?  No, no.  And then my wife was on the road with me, you know, and she still is, you know, my beautiful,  gorgeous, lovely wife, Shelby.  And Shelby and I, you know, we've been, we were together longer than Cheech and I have  been together.  And she was with me when we met Cheech.  And, and so she would, she would do a few, you know, jokes too.  Oh, yeah, that's got to hurt.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, but it's all, it's all, it's all good now.  Well, we got offered a ton of money to do a reunion and, you know, you know. 
[03:52:00]  That kind of patches things up a little bit.  Money takes care of all problems.  Yeah, you go, oh, okay.  It's the only reason Ant and I are still doing this thing.  Oh, yeah.  For that kind of money, I'll apologize.  Hey, best of friends.  Yeah.  Yeah, we apologize to the Catholic Church so we can get our gigs back.  Yeah.  Yeah, we did, didn't we?  Oh, that's right.  Didn't I read about that?  Yeah, that was us, Tommy.  What did you guys do?  Well, uh.  All right, you know, don't, don't, don't get into it.  No, it's all right.  Allegedly, a couple had butt sex at St. Pat's Cathedral during our show one day. 
[03:52:30]  That's right, that's right.  When did that happen?  Because was I in jail later?  That was about two years ago, a little over.  A little over.  No, I was, yeah, but I do remember.  We were shown the door.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was when we got fired the last time, and they kept us off the air for two  years.  Two years?  Two years.  Yeah.  And now you're on satellite.  Yeah.  We did a two-year sentence for that one.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, the FCC just really was pissed off.  Oh, yeah.  And now we got, you know, we got our forum here on satellite, so we can say whatever we 
[03:53:00]  want.  I love the forum.  I love satellite.  I know.  You don't have to deal with the FCC.  I couldn't believe it.  You know, I didn't know anything about satellite, and I rented a Cadillac in somewhere in Fort  Wayne, Indiana, or something.  And all of a sudden, I'm getting all these great stations.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, where normally you just get the church music blasting through your speakers for 800  miles in any direction.  Now, and wherever you are, you could listen to one station the whole time.  It was pretty cool.  It was so cool.  Except it would, there were certain areas you couldn't get it or something? 
[03:53:30]  I don't know.  Sometimes if there's tall buildings around.  Yeah, something like that.  You've got a problem.  But they put repeaters in the picture.  Yeah, in general, the signal is pretty crystal clear.  And the sound is so much superior.  Oh, yeah.  Lauren wants to say hi in Florida.  Lauren, what's up?  Yeah, Opie Anthony, little Jimmy.  Love you guys.  Thank you.  Tommy Chong, my hero.  Hey.  Hey, this whole dip in the pot in honey thing.  Uh-oh.  First of all, I love you.  I have emphysema.  I can't smoke anymore. 
[03:54:00]  There is hope.  Well, listen.  I do not advocate the use of pot.  Oh, there you go.  I hear you.  Stay out of jail.  Stay out of jail.  I don't advocate the use of pot.  He's just talking about the old days.  I'm just telling you a story that a guy told me, a friend of mine in jail told me, that  that's what he does if he's got emphysema.  So are you going to try it?  There you go.  Uh, growing up, my dad was a beekeeper.  Oh, yeah.  He grew marijuana for smoking the bees.  When you're working with the bees, you just got to smoke them.  What a great idea. 
[03:54:30]  And he used marijuana.  Sure.  So now I go the other way and use marijuana, dip it in honey, and it's come full circle.  Hey, Tommy.  You don't just use the honey for tea, do you?  Oh, no.  You dip your pot in it, man.  That's great.  All right.  Come with us again.  Exactly.  DEA.  Tommy, I like this honey.  You don't just put it on toast or anything, do you?  Well, I want to do butter.  Butter?  Yeah.  I, I, the marijuana logs, you know, where I'm appearing, I, I do a bit about making butter 
[03:55:00]  because I think that butter has a better chance of being legal than smoking, you know, than  cigarettes.  Because I think eventually cigarettes will probably be, you know.  They're heading in that, in that direction.  Eased right out.  But butter, pot butter.  Pot butter.  I can't believe it's pot butter.  Spread it on bread.  DEA right now is like, we got to get this.  He's got a plot.  Put pot in everyone's butter or something. 
[03:55:30]  I heard it on the radio.  We're going to contaminate our butters of plywood pot.  Put it back in jail.  They're waiting outside right now.  With their DEA shirts on.  DEA shirts and headbands.  Hippie headbands.  Hey, Nick, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I'm going to the show tomorrow night.  I have two questions.  One, should I show up stoned?  And if I do, are there munchies available in the theater?  There's munchies available all over the place.  And I didn't hear that last question. 
[03:56:00]  Because technically, I can't be around anybody that's...  Oh, right.  Yeah, I'm supposed to be.  But if it's stoned naturally, then it's okay.  All right.  Mark in Jersey.  Hey, Mark.  Hey, what's going on?  We're with Tommy Chong.  How are you guys doing?  Jim.  Guys, I love you.  Thank you.  Now, you see, I was driving over that during George Washington Bridge.  And I looked down and I saw some kids smoking out of a bong made out of a Poland spring bottle.  Oh, my God. 
[03:56:30]  Yep.  You see everything as a trucker, you see?  Wow.  You really felt that one sputtering out, didn't you, sir?  He's doing a couple of callbacks from earlier in the show there, Tommy.  Tim in California.  What's up, Tim?  Hey, man.  Hi.  My friend's mom used to make pie crust with pot butter in it all the time.  As soon as he said that thing about honey and buds, I've been trying to call in.  But, yeah, you eat a piece of pie and it takes you like an hour and 15 minutes.  But, man, you were ripped, dude.  I bet. 
[03:57:00]  You were ripped.  That's the trouble with eating it.  You know, because...  You have no idea how much you've done.  Well, you get the munchies and you can't stop eating.  So, you've got to be very, very, very careful.  You've got to be very careful if your food's made out of the pot.  Oh, yeah.  So, one time, you know, some fan gave me a muffin.  And, like a fool, you know, I took a little bite.  Next thing you know, it's gone.  And I was gone for about three days. 
[03:57:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  I couldn't get...  I could get out of bed.  And I'll tell you how stoned I was.  I went everywhere with my wife.  She was shopping.  I went everywhere with her and sat and waited for her.  And she tried stuff on it.  I loved everything she put on it.  I said, that's great.  Yeah, just take your time.  I don't care.  Yeah.  I'm in another world.  The weed master wants to add to this discussion.  Oh, the weed master.  Weed master.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, THC has to be heated to be psychoactive.  So, that's why when you heat it in butter, it works. 
[03:58:00]  But for the honey thing, you got to boil up your honey so it gets hot.  So, that makes that THC active.  Okay.  That's all.  Puss it out.  I had no idea.  He sounds very stoned.  It sure should.  Always.  Todd in Kansas.  What's up, Todd?  Oh, not much.  I just want to ask Tommy today, is the movie The Korsinger Brothers ever going to be released  on DVD? 
[03:58:30]  That's a good question.  It was made for Orion Pictures, who went bankrupt.  I don't know who owns that.  We'll have to find out.  That's a good question.  I'll have to check it out.  You do all right with those movies still?  You get money from them?  You guys were smart when it came to the business end?  Yeah, yeah.  We do pretty good.  That's good.  Because you hear from some people, it's just a disaster.  Oh, yeah.  I know.  I mean, we had our many disasters, but we were lucky.  We were very lucky.  Cool.  I think we're running out of time.  Yeah, they just gave us the cue. 
[03:59:00]  We're running out of time.  We want to thank Tommy Chong for stopping in.  Very interesting.  Tommy, a pleasure.  Thanks for having me.  We learned that Arnold Schwarzenegger loves pot.  I smoked a pot.  That's what I learned today on the program.  It's the Marijuana Logs at the Actors Playhouse, 107th Avenue South.  You can go to www.potshow.com for all the ticket info, right?

[04:01:00]  And that's the possibility that there may be a smallpox epidemic in this country.  Unbelievable.  A smallpox epidemic.  How could that be possible?  And the reason is because the smallpox vaccine that we were given and that I was told was going to last forever wore off.  And our government waited until a possible emergency condition to inform us. 
[04:01:30]  Now that's a crackerjack group of fuckers, isn't it?  How could you fucking not call us?  Hey, Lou, your smallpox vaccine wore off.  You want another?  You fucking wait!  I want another!  I want another!  Because my whole life has been a delusion.  Because every day I'd wake up and I'd go, you know, it's going to suck today, but at least I'm not getting smallpox. 
[04:02:00]  To wait as long as the federal government waited to tell us about this, it's as if you went to a public bathroom and you flushed the toilet and the toilet water just hit you in the face.  And then as you walked out of the bathroom, around the door was a big sign, warning, toilet water may hit you in the face.  If I get smallpox, I'll file suit against the federal government because they took me out of a very important class to get that vaccine. 
[04:02:30]  And if I'd taken that class, I wouldn't have to do this bullshit for a living.  I'd have a real job like with WorldCom or Enron or Tyco or Global Crossing.  We're in Delphia.  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio.  XM Satellite Radio.  Radio to the power of X.
