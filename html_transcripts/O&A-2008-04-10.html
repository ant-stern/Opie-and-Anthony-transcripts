<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Anthony detailing severe stomach issues, prompting crude bathroom humor from the hosts.  A caller, Jay from Dallas, angrily criticized Anthony for missing work due to illness and a prior poker game, resulting in a heated exchange of insults.  The conversation then pivoted to home invasions on Long Island, sparking a discussion on gun ownership and self-defense.  Callers recounted personal experiences confronting intruders, some involving fatal shootings, leading to a debate about the legality and ethics of such actions. A retired police sergeant described pointing a gun at a con artist, and another caller recounted shooting and killing two intruders.  Leslie Nielsen was a guest during this segment.

The show continued with a discussion of Jesse Ventura's controversial interview, which had circulated online (FARC.com, potentially BREAK.com),  and 9/11 conspiracy theories, referencing "Loose Change" and the JFK assassination.  Callers offered varied opinions on these theories, and a blog post criticizing Jim Norton's past interaction with 9/11 conspiracy theorists was read on-air. The hosts also briefly mentioned their planned animation festival.  A planned "brawl" between Jesse Ventura and Jimmy Norton, titled "Conspiracy Mania 6: And Justice for Brawl," was promoted.  Much of the discussion involved contentious back-and-forth between the hosts regarding common sense versus speculation.

A significant portion focused on Tippi Tom, a recurring homeless guest known for his eccentric personality and strong odor.  The hosts discussed his deteriorating health, particularly his legs, and planned potentially offensive stunts involving him, including smelling his clothes and scraping his tongue.  They also discussed the anticipated arrival of Tippi Tom's brother, who was trying to reconnect after years of separation, though his arrival was delayed due to a meeting.  A news story about an elementary school principal arrested with underage girls in a Super 8 motel, supplying them with alcohol and drugs, was discussed, along with highly graphic speculation about the situation and a caller from Miami agreeing with their negative sentiments about some immigrant communities' lack of English fluency.

Tippi Tom’s in-studio appearance followed, marked by suggestive and sexually explicit comments from the hosts regarding his physique. The hosts engaged in crude jokes about his appearance, repeatedly urging him to show his buttocks ("Golden Buns").  Extensive discussion about Tippi Tom’s life covered his past as a successful businessman, subsequent struggles with gambling and substance abuse, strained relationship with his son, and his current homelessness. He expressed Republican leanings but showed limited knowledge of current events.  A comical incident involved a second individual claiming to be Tippi Tom, resolved (allegedly) by a physical examination of their buttocks, leading to more explicit comments and actions,  with E-Rock becoming ill due to proximity to Tom. A planned blackjack game between Anthony and Tippi Tom, with money and beer as stakes, was set up but abruptly cut short before commencing. Promotion for Jim Norton's Michigan shows also occurred.

A prolonged blackjack game between Opie, Anthony, and Tippi Tom ensued, featuring significant cash and beer wagers.  Tippi Tom initially won substantially, but ultimately lost everything in a final high-stakes hand.  The game was marked by shouting, cursing, accusations of cheating, and requests for Tippy Tom to keep his cards visible.  His emotional distress after losing prompted attempts to entertain him, including showing a clip from "Sophie's Choice," which caused him to become emotional due to its depiction of Nazi atrocities (he is of German descent). The conversation again shifted to his underwear, leading to attempts by the hosts to purchase and forcibly remove them for $5, resulting in further vulgar commentary on their soiled condition. This segment ended with Tippi Tom's departure, after losing all his money and beer. Pat Duffy made a brief appearance at the end.

A final segment featured Pat Duffy performing a shocking stunt involving his feces, creating a "doo-doo mustache." The hosts and staff reacted with disgust.  The conversation then veered into unrelated topics including the hosts’ reactions to the Pat Duffy incident, jokes about AIDS and Hepatitis, discussion of a man masturbating in a bathroom, Tippi Tom’s drinking habits and bad breath (leading to E-Rock vomiting), and Tippi Tom's emotional breakdown discussing his mother's death and personal struggles. The show also mentioned an "Above Radio" campaign,  comments on Tom's underwear, discussions of infidelity using AshleyMadison.com as a context, and requests for songs. The show concluded with the hosts leaving their microphones on while Tippi Tom continued to ramble.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shop jobs.  Opie and Anthony.  Biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good. 
[00:00:30]  Go screw!  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shop jobs, Opie and Anthony.  Let's welcome Leslie Nielsen to the Opie and Anthony Show.  All do, do.  Did you play drunk or stroke?  Okay, stroke.  Opie and Anthony.  My first time sort of touching a woman. 
[00:01:00]  I don't know what words were you used.  First time you picked a girl's nose.  What happened?  Her parents come home, so we break it all up,  and the dog runs over, and he's just licking, licking, licking my finger.  This is where entertainment is going.  You're Chris Hansen.  I am.  Have you seen the show?  I thought you were real funny on Opie and Anthony.  Oh, you listened to me on Opie and Anthony.  Wow.  That's a plug you don't really want.  That is unbelievable.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Ah.  Here we are again.  Hi.  Good morning.  Good morning.  How's Anthony feeling?  That's what everybody wants to know.  Oh, my goodness.  The instant feedback is going nuts.  How is old Gravy Legs?  So much better.  Old Gravy Legs.  How's 40 Flurf doing today?  There's nothing worse than when you have an upset tummy. 
[00:02:00]  You just can't function.  The digestive system is definitely the boss.  Yeah.  The boss of the body.  Much better.  Yesterday you were pooping a lot.  Well.  If we could say that.  I don't even know.  Yeah.  I think you can.  It's infantile.  If they take out pooping to save the children, you know, it's like, oh, well, the children 
[00:02:30]  might hear it.  They use it every day.  That's the first word they learn.  Yeah.  I believe that is the first word.  Maybe mom and then poop.  That's the second word they learn.  It'll be dad.  And then, no, dad's third.  Dad doesn't rate.  Yeah, because he's barely home.  So you're cramping up.  You were hitting the bathroom a lot yesterday.  Oh, it was doubling over in pain.  Yeah.  And it's that pain where it's from your lower abdomen to the back of your kneecaps. 
[00:03:00]  Just, just, and cold sweats.  You just go, oh, oh, I got to get in there.  Yeah, horrid.  I went home and just, like, taught the toilet a lesson.  Hope he likes to say.  Beat it up a little bit.  Yeah, beat it up.  Multiple flushes.  I think my water bill's going to be high this month just from flushing yesterday.  You think after you sat down for 30 times, like, the 31st time you walk into the bathroom, 
[00:03:30]  this was like, all right, I get it.  Enough.  Enough already.  I won't eat chicken tacos anymore from this horrible restaurant or whatever.  I could have read a novel.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, when you go in there and, ah, you know, you pick up one of those jokes for  the John book or something.  Huddle, huddle.  Bathroom humor.  Rules.  I hate those books.  There's a million of them, though.  So he's doing something right.  What is it?  John's Bathroom Reading. 
[00:04:00]  What the hell is that series called?  I just remember jokes for the John.  No.  Ah, what is it?  The guy came out with one goof book for the John, and he has, like, 20, 30 of them now.  Like, how many jokes are there out there?  What is it called?  D-Rock.  It's John's Bathroom Reading Series.  Yeah, thank you.  You would think that one would be good enough, because these books are pretty thick, too,  but it just goes on and on and on and on. 
[00:04:30]  It just keeps going.  It's unbelievable.  He found a niche for himself.  That's good.  I guess so.  Phone number 877-212-O-N-A.  I got to say, you know, I fight this battle with Anthony with the home invasion thing  and the guns and the paranoia, and Anthony's now, what, carrying a gun while you walk around  your place?  I'm adamant.  Well, yeah.  You know, if I'm walking around the house, you know, I'm downstairs in the living room 
[00:05:00]  or something, I'm packing.  You're packing heat.  I'm packing heat, as Beretta said.  Because you decided that it wasn't good enough to just have guns laying all over the place.  No.  Now you need it on your person at all times.  No, shotguns, rifles, things like that.  Yeah, they're around the house.  Yeah.  But, you know, I start thinking to myself, hey, unless you have a pistol with you, you're  pretty vulnerable. 
[00:05:30]  Right.  And everybody calls me crazy, kook, although we get a lot of calls, to be honest, that  support my view.  And the very next day, these stories pop up.  That just defend my point.  Absolutely.  This guy is not happy with us.  Jay in Dallas, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, Ant, I just want to say I'm glad you're feeling better, obviously.  Thank you.  But, you know, it's amazing now.  We've gotten to the point where, look, I'm not one of these guys that hates the show or  is going to gripe or whatever. 
[00:06:00]  But the thing is, it's like now, drinking all night and playing cards is making you miss  work.  And it's like, you know, you make a lot of money to do what you do.  I got more calls.  I got more calls about, shut up.  You shut up, idiot.  And listen, listen to me, you dumb mother F.  Listen to me.  Listen to me, idiot.  Hey, stupid.  Hey, stupid.  Hey, stupid.  Hey, stupid.  Hey, stupid.  Hey, stupid.  It was a best of, you dumb F, you stupid son of a bitch.  He is trying to say that he's mad that we didn't do the X-Am show yesterday. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, no, no.  So he thinks, because the best, hey, dude, did you listen to yesterday's X-Am show?  Yeah, I absolutely, no, I absolutely did.  And what happened?  Nothing happened.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  When you listened to yesterday's show, was I there?  You did, y'all weren't there the whole show.  All right, I was.  So what, Jimmy and Opie did the X-Am portion yesterday, right? 
[00:07:00]  No.  Wait, wait, wait.  Right?  He's calling to say, not happy that we, all of us, skipped the X-Am show yesterday.  He said, not happy you skipped X-Am show.  Do you think that?  Dude, dude.  So Jimmy and Opie did the show yesterday.  Y'all missed the show, but you're the reason why.  Do you do realize, though, that a poker game thing was like a year ago?  Do what?  The poker game being drunk thing was like a year ago. 
[00:07:30]  Wait, there's a lot of confusion.  Yesterday on the X-Am show, I think we replayed a show where Anthony was, what, hungover or something?  Yeah, Anthony was hungover.  Extremely hungover.  And the whole bit was to try to get him to puke or something like that?  Yeah.  Which was a perfect day to replay that yesterday.  And I talked to so many people that thought that was just the X-Am portion of the show yesterday.  No, no, no.  I realized that was a worst of it.  Now you're still stupid.  Okay, but no.  What I'm saying is, what I'm saying is, look, man. 
[00:08:00]  I don't care that you got jacked up and you couldn't do the show, whatever, you know?  But it's like...  Jacked up?  I didn't even have a...  I wasn't puking.  I was crapping.  Whatever, man.  Okay, either way, you weren't well enough to do the show.  All right?  Yes, so?  You never took a day off or half a day?  I did three hours yesterday.  And I missed two hours.  Well, you didn't really do three hours yesterday, let's be honest.  I sat here for two hours. 
[00:08:30]  I had a good first hour.  You did about an hour and 45 minutes, if you really want to get into this a little bit.  Hold on up.  The voice in Anthony's head is still talking.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, look.  Hey, you can shut up, too, bro.  Why are you screaming at me?  I can't stand this guy.  Go screw yourself.  My problem is, a show like Ron and Fez, those guys know they're going to be missing work.  So what do they do?  They stay after a record show, so we don't have to listen to replays.  You, on the other hand, have a much...  Shut up.  That show's full of psychopaths.  You're a freaking millionaire. 
[00:09:00]  You can't be a little responsible and stay for work?  You do five hours a day, so shut up.  Oh, go, go.  Just die.  Go drive.  You live in Dallas?  Have the same frigging ending Kennedy had.  I hope that happens to you, Jay.  Yeah, it is real intelligent.  Shut up.  You do not.  Hang up on this tool.  Go...  I hate this guy. 
[00:09:30]  I dumped out of myself.  I was responsible.  Threw out the atom bomb, did you?  Ass.  You never curse, though.  I can't take people like that.  Enough of you.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  You're entitled.  Do you feel entitled?  Give me a break.  All right, so where were we?  Anthony with guns in his house?  Yeah.  Come on over, Jay.  Oh.  I hate that guy. 
[00:10:00]  So anyway, I take the stance.  I think it's a bit crazy when it comes to his guns.  Paranoid people have called me.  Paranoid.  It's not a popular stance I take because most people agree with you on the phone lines.  I have to acknowledge that.  But when it comes down to you actually carrying a gun around your house, it's a little weird,  a little strange.  It does on the outside seem a little weird.  It's not the Wild West.  You don't live in the Bronx.  You don't live in a bad neighborhood.  But that's just the point. 
[00:10:30]  You know, that is the point.  But you have a really good alarm system.  Yeah.  You have a cop that's pretty much living with you full time at this point.  It does not.  So why the gun?  Why the gun on the holster?  Because you never know.  You never know.  And I refuse to be that victim that's tied up, being bludgeoned.  I mean, it can't be comfortable.  If you're lounging on your couch watching a movie, I think the gun would get in the way.  No.  Why don't you have guns around the house in perfect areas? 
[00:11:00]  Because you can't get to it faster than you can with it right there on your hip.  Yeah.  You can't get to it fast enough.  All right.  And these home invasions on Long Island, especially in my county, it's ridiculous.  And they go for neighborhoods and houses just like mine.  Right.  And this one is scary because if you listen to this news story, it has nothing to do with  an alarm system or anything else.  Right.  We chalk one up for Anthony today because, yes, there was another home invasion on Long Island. 
[00:11:30]  Long Island is like the home invasion.  Like capital of the world of the country.  It seems like I, you know, we broadcast a lot of areas and I don't hear about home invasions  as much as I do on Long Island.  So one for Anthony today.  Here's the latest home invasion news story.  Police are on the lookout for at least three suspects this morning after a home invasion  on Long Island.  They say a 17-year-old girl was home alone in Westbury yesterday when someone posed as a  delivery man knocked on the door. 
[00:12:00]  When she opened it up, two more men were pushed their way inside armed with a gun.  Cops say they handcuffed the girl, then ransacked the home before taking off with an unknown number  of goods.  See, look at that.  A delivery guy.  So now, you know, someone knocks on your door.  A lot of people just open the door.  Yeah.  Someone knocks.  Well, you want to know what they want.  You open the door.  Right.  If it's some delivery guy or something else, you're like, now I got to open the door.  Right. 
[00:12:30]  And at that point, you are completely defenseless.  Your alarm's not going to help you.  But no one was shot or killed or raped or tied up.  Lucky for her.  Just a few things were taken.  Lucky for her.  She must have been unattractive.  Now, would you kill the intruder at this?  Oh, my God.  In this situation?  If a delivery guy comes to the door, I open it up.  Yeah.  And I see two other people start approaching the door.  I'm drawing and firing. 
[00:13:00]  What the hell am I going to do?  Wait.  What are your intentions?  These guys are running into my house.  Wow.  These guys are quick delivery guys.  There's three of them.  I thought there were only one.  I don't see a package.  I guess they're delivering a handgun.  That's nice because they're all holding one.  I'm not going to.  I lose today.  I mean, obviously, that would have been a great situation to have a gun in.  Yeah.  And my gun is accessible to me all the time, even when I sleep. 
[00:13:30]  Please don't start bringing it to work.  No, no, I can't.  I'm a good boy.  That's good to know.  I think it's against CBS rules to have firearms.  One phone call like Joe.  One phone call like Joe and you're going to go postal on all of us.  Let's go to Rich in Brooklyn.  Rich, you're on the O.P. and Anthony show.  How are you, sir?  Good morning.  Jay from Dallas?  What did I say?  Joe.  Joe, yeah.  Jay from Dallas.  Stupid Jay from Dallas. 
[00:14:00]  Yuck.  What's up, Rich?  Nothing much, guys.  Listen.  I'm a retired cop.  I retired as a sergeant about 15 years ago, and I'm 60 years of age, and I've got to  tell you, my kids are out of the house.  They're all grown.  They're adults.  I have grandchildren.  Bottom line, I still carry my off-duty army.  A little J-frame sheet, five shot.  It's still in my pocket.  I stayed in the door.  I had it years ago.  While I was on the job, some moron Puerto Rican kid came from my door.  He's trying to collect.  He said, for luck of me, some kind of BS garbage about leukemia. 
[00:14:30]  Bottom line, I had an off-duty car with a kid who was a fraud, and I put the gun through  his head, had him laid down on the floor.  This kid didn't know what happened.  Bottom line, if you have a license, you've got a firearm, you keep it on you.  You know, like Carl Moulton said, you don't leave home without it.  In the house, I still carry the garbage.  There you go.  See?  In the house.  Bottom line is, you're legal on it.  Keep the damn thing.  It's there for a reason.  It's for your protection.  They're all home pushing, shoving.  You know what?  Guy comes to the door. 
[00:15:00]  He's getting capped.  He's the wrong guy.  Bottom line.  Very good.  I just think you should make it more interesting.  I'll make it like a trap door or something.  You've got the intruder at the door.  You know he's up to no good.  You push a button.  The stoop collapses, and there's a nice cage right below.  A cage there with other people in it going, ah, he got you too.  And then once a week, you can have the cops come by and take everyone away.  Empty it.  You paranoid freak.  I'd rather be tried by six.  They call it carried by six. 
[00:15:30]  I tried by 12.  I know the saying, yes.  I like the way he tripped over it, though.  He did trip over it.  I'm going to pull my hand from my cold, dead gun.  Wait a minute.  That's not what I meant.  From my cold, dead hand.  That's right.  Yes.  That is absolutely right.  That's just, you know, a little feeling of security, I've got to tell you.  I've got to be honest with you.  This didn't work out too well.  Kevin in Arizona.  Kevin.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Kevin.  How are you, buddy?  Doing all right. 
[00:16:00]  Good.  Hey, guys.  This morning, where I live there in Albuquerque, I'm driving a truck now, but there was a guy.  A guy just gets in, home from Iraq, all right?  Mm-hmm.  This piece of crap breaks into this guy's garage, right?  The homeowner grabs his gun.  The guy starts wrestling around with the dude, chases him down the street, puts a cap in him,  kills the guy dead, all right?  Well, now here's our wonderful state of New Mexico, is sitting there charging this guy  with manslaughter, can fix him, all right? 
[00:16:30]  That's just absurd, man.  Well, let me tell you something.  Sir, I will tell you something.  There are many rules that you must read up on on the use of deadly physical force, and  if the guy runs away, you can't shoot him.  You can't.  Even if you feel that your life is threatened, the second that breaks off and you no longer  feel like your life is threatened because the attacker, the aggressor, turns and backs  away from the aggressive action, you then can't use deadly physical force. 
[00:17:00]  Right.  You have to just let him go.  You've got to make sure you shoot him in the front.  Shoot him in the front.  So you should work on your sprints.  Yeah.  Work on your sprints.  Get in front of him.  Get in front of him, turn and shoot, and you'll be fine.  Hey, one more thing.  Here in Albuquerque, we've got the concealed carry law now, so it's really cool now.  Oh, yeah.  Walk around just like the Wild West, man.  Great.  You know, I really think that helps because people really don't know. 
[00:17:30]  If you don't know if the citizens are armed, you're not going to be robbing people randomly.  Right.  In New York City, you know damn well that the regular citizenry walking around is not  armed because it's almost impossible to get a pistol license in New York City.  So it's easy pickings.  You can just go around and take your illegal handgun and rob people with it, knowing that 
[00:18:00]  you're not going to get drawn on by some citizen that went through the proper channels and everything  else.  It's ridiculous.  All right, let's go to Nick in North Dakota.  Nick, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Good, man.  Anthony, you're going to end up shooting the Publisher Clearinghouse Prize Squad.  He's got a check.  And you're going to put a bullet in their head.  That check looks suspect.  It's huge.  I had to shoot.  Well, I'm glad Anthony's okay from his home invasion.  Well, I got to also say something else. 
[00:18:30]  I was at the police station the other day turning in some paperwork.  I thought you were turning yourself in.  No.  Why would I turn myself in?  Who knows what you're doing?  They make it very interesting, though.  Here's what you have to do, though.  Yeah.  When you want to buy a handgun, you have to go to one police station.  There's only one that you can go to in all of Nassau County to get a paper that's filled 
[00:19:00]  out.  Then you can go to the gun store with this piece of paper that you had to go to the police  station for.  Buy your gun.  Then, within 10 days, you have to go back to the police station with the gun and the  paper that they gave you and the receipt and fill out more paperwork.  And then you leave.  If you don't do it within 10 days, you just lose your license, your gun, everything.  So you've got to do this all within 10 days.  Yeah, but why?  Send something to the police station to say he bought a gun here.  You've got to do it yourself.  You've got to go to the police station, get the form, fill it out. 
[00:19:30]  Then the gun store has to fill it out.  Then you've got to take it back to the police station.  So when I was doing this, there was a guy online, and I turned around, and he's a fan  of the show.  And he's like, oh my God, Anthony, I can't believe you're here.  He goes, you're the reason I'm here.  Really?  He's filling out his application.  That's good.  Turning on more people.  Exactly.  Armed citizenry.  I am a card-carrying member of the NRA.  Why go through all that when you could just go under a bridge somewhere here in Manhattan 
[00:20:00]  and just look into a trunk and pick what you want?  Exactly.  And a mandatory year in prison.  Why not go the illegal route?  There was a cop, another retired cop, very mad at the other retired cop that just called  the show, but he hung up.  He couldn't stick around, I guess.  What was his problem?  He thought that guy was setting a bad example or something.  I don't know, but he's gone now, so we can't go there.  Oh boy.  Mike, Mike, don't give Anthony more ideas, please. 
[00:20:30]  Go ahead.  Hey, you got a backup piece in your sock?  Well, I am looking into that.  Of course you are.  I think I need a backup.  No, I don't have a backup piece in my sock.  I'm going to tuck one into your condom while you're wearing it.  I'm going to just pull it out of the condom and start shooting it.  I'm going to have to get out of bed.  Pew, pew.  A little tiny condom.  Get a tiny condom gun.  Oh wait, he has that already.  Jason, Allentown, what's up?  Oh, this is for Anthony. 
[00:21:00]  Seven years ago, two guys broke into my house.  I was home sleeping.  They're no longer living.  Wow.  Look at that.  Did you get him in your sleep?  But that's got to be horrific, cleaning up the blood the next day.  Did you move at least?  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't think you would want to continue living in the house where you killed two guys.  No.  No, 40 caliber does the job.  Really?  Were there pieces just everywhere?  No, just two big holes in them. 
[00:21:30]  Two big holes and a lot of blood.  Jesus.  Wait, what happened, dude?  You woke up and there were men in your room and you grabbed for the...  How did that happen?  That's interesting.  Yeah.  I was lying there sleeping and I heard a noise downstairs, so I got up, grabbed my gun,  as usual, and went down, caught two Hispanic men in my living room running steel stuff.  Now, did you try to get them to leave or what did you start shooting?  No, I just shot them.  Yeah.  When they're in your house doing stuff like that, you're within your right. 
[00:22:00]  But I mean, did the guy put his hands up when he saw you with a pistol?  Hands up?  No, no, but like, baby, hands up.  How's that song go?  Hands up.  Were they armed?  Like, hey.  I don't know.  They were in my house.  I love this guy.  I don't know.  They were in my house.  He doesn't even know if they were robbing them.  He was just a little, you know, drowsy from sleeping.  Did it end up that they were armed or no?  Not that I know of.  According to the police, no.  But 2.30 in the morning.  That's very good.  This is for Jimmy, by the way. 
[00:22:30]  Jimmy likes.  Because Jimmy wanted to know if they had their hands up.  Just have this ready to play.  And then they'll all just put their hands up.  Yeah, exactly.  Just turn on your stereo and have this blast out.  Baby, hands up.  Give me your heart.  Give me, give me your heart.  Give me, give me.  Hands up.  Hands up, you.  Give me your heart.  Give me, give me.  Give me your heart.  Give me, give me.  Oh, God. 
[00:23:00]  Whoever gets to this point of the song.  No, stop.  Play this dumb stuff at weddings and baseball games and blah, blah, blah.  Pitted, so pitted.  So pitted, those guys.  All right, well, I guess people want to talk about guns because the phone's just lit.  Is there a gun in Ann's toilet like the Godfather?  I don't have one with a pull chain to put behind it.  No?  Scumbag checking in. 
[00:23:30]  Can you say that on the radio?  I don't think so.  It's his name.  Hey, we're not allowed to say your name on the radio.  So, hello, sir.  How are you?  Yeah, that pretty much sucks, right?  Yeah, no kidding.  What's going on, guys?  Hello.  Not much.  Taking your call.  Eagerly awaiting.  Taking your call.  We got a nice rhythm going, unlike yesterday.  So let's go.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm a tattoo artist.  And I was doing a tattoo about two weeks ago on a Saturday night.  Tattooed this kid all day long.  Eight hours straight. 
[00:24:00]  The shop owner sat down.  We both tag-timed him.  He hit his arm.  I hit his back.  That don't sound good.  But we ate this kid for eight hours.  Shop's getting ready to close.  I'm about to finish this tattoo in about 15 minutes.  And I see the silhouette coming by the window.  It's been focused on my tattoo.  I look up.  There's a gun on us.  There's me and two other guys in the shop.  And he says, give me all your money.  I says, hey, bud, the shop owner just left.  We ain't got no money.  He just took it with him. 
[00:24:30]  He says, don't tell me that stuff.  He says, empty your pockets.  I want to get him tattooing.  He got a pocket full of money because he's getting his tattoo.  Everybody empties their pockets out in that.  Guy walks around the counter to leave.  And I'm not on the floor.  He says, get on the floor.  I'll kill you.  I says, all right.  Don't get down on the floor.  I hear the hammer pulled back on his gun.  You know, it's a revolver.  So you hear that cylinder on the revolver index and a hammer clicking into place while  he's about to shoot.  So I grabbed my .45 and I emptied out the clip on him. 
[00:25:00]  And the first two shots were random.  The other 11 shots, if they didn't hit him, they were in the walls.  And he ran out of the tattoo shop, made a left turn, and he ran in front of the windows.  And I saw all the windows out of the tattoo shop, too.  And, yeah, right.  So we got boards over our windows right now.  And the cops come, and he says, you think you hit the guy?  I says, I don't know.  I could have missed him.  I was on target the whole time.  Well, after I had shot, he made that next turn around the building.  I couldn't see him anymore. 
[00:25:30]  My clip was empty.  So I turned the lights off on the tattoo shop so I could see outside.  And I dropped the clips, put another clip in.  I went outside, cleared the area, made sure he wasn't there laying or waiting to get another  shot in or something, you know.  So the cops show up, and I'm like, man, that's, you know, you think you hit him?  I says, you know, if I didn't, I was on target the whole time.  Yeah, you said that already.  I really want to thank you for walking us through this robbery in real time.  That was, yeah.  So what's the end of the story?  Yeah, that's what we need, the end. 
[00:26:00]  Then the cops find him, the cops find him a mile away.  And they think he had a bulletproof vest on.  He had eight holes in his hoodie, one in his side and back area, and one in his elbow.  And they found him a mile away, bleed not.  And they said five more minutes, he would have died.  So he's being charged with armed robbers.  See, that was smart for you to shoot out the window.  Because to me, like, if a guy has a gun and he's robbing you, and then he runs outside,  you don't know where he's going.  He could be coming back in.  But, yeah, that's probably why he began trouble. 
[00:26:30]  The guy's running away.  You just don't know.  But, see, when he ran out of the tattoo shop, he made a left-hand turn.  He ducked over, and he tucked his right hand under himself, so the gun was facing in the  shop the whole time, you know?  Where are you from?  I like your accent, dude.  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  This guy's a hardcore man.  No kidding.  I ducked it under there, and I love this.  I shot through the window.  Hey, thanks for your story, sir.  All right, man.  Have a good one, guys.  I think we got one more in before we hit the break here. 
[00:27:00]  Bill Jersey, what's up?  No, Bill.  Yeah, how's it going, man?  Good.  What's up?  Listen, I caught a guy in my house in the middle of the night, like 3 o'clock in the  morning.  I cracked him in the head with a friggin' dumbbell, and I ended up in jail for a year  and five years probation.  You what?  You ended up in jail?  I ended up in the...  Yeah.  For hitting him over the head with a dumbbell?  Yeah.  They told me I overprotected myself.  That's interesting. 
[00:27:30]  What state was this?  New Jersey.  Seems like you might be leaving something out.  Would you have a crappy lawyer?  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  Just could have to smack a guy with a dumbbell.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  All right, we got to take our first break.  We can continue down this road a little bit longer after the break.  Lots of stuff to do today, so let's get right to the break here.  Opie and Anthony.  Da, da, da, da.  Moving on.  We'll do the home invasion thing next time it comes up.  It comes up a lot on this fine radio show. 
[00:28:00]  It certainly does.  That is the Opie and Anthony show.  American Airlines.  Wow.  I took an American Airlines flight home from vacation.  Uh-oh.  And I hate flying.  I'm just saying.  I'm paranoid to begin with with flying, and what, they canceled 1,000 flights?  Over 1,000 flights yesterday?  1,000 flights yesterday.  About 900 today.  How the hell do you do that?  How do you make up that?  Well, the FAA has been so in bed with the airlines for so many years.  Because their job, I think, is the FAA is to promote aviation. 
[00:28:30]  It's not.  Yeah.  The NTSB is the one who really gets on them.  Yeah.  Uh, and I think they're just doing an inspection that they probably should have done.  Mm-hmm.  I guess there's, uh, wires, what, in the, the wheel, uh, well, that are bundled up and  stuff and then, and bunched up in the, if these wires short-circuits, uh, the fuel  tank could explode.  Ah.  And then what happens?  You land?  That is scary to think, man.  That's those, uh, MD-80s.  I, I never get on those.  Oh, my God. 
[00:29:00]  I, whenever I make a flight reservation somewhere, I just, uh, I check equipment, what they're  flying, and if it's an MD-80, I'll find another flight.  Yeah.  I don't like those at all.  But then they're saying the 777s also have, uh, had some wiring problems.  Yeah.  And that's a relatively new plane, like, from 95, I think.  Um, but those MD-80s, ugh.  777s, a twin-engine, massive plane.  Yeah.  And that, that was the, uh, British, uh, Airways one.  Yeah.  All the power just cut out, like, two miles.  They were lucky they were two miles from the airport.  Yeah.  But the power just stopped. 
[00:29:30]  They just kind of cruised in quietly.  That's why they thundered onto the runway like that.  Yeah.  They were two miles out, and they just lost power.  That's a frightening plane to lose power.  Are you scared to fly, Jimmy?  You fly a lot.  I mean, you're flying this weekend.  Today I'm flying.  You're flying today to Michigan.  Yeah, you're going to be up to that.  Detroit.  Detroit, Michigan area for a couple shows.  Go to eatabullet.com for all the details.  But are you scared of flying?  Um, yes and no.  I mean, it was a phobia for a long time.  I still have, like, a tentative feeling, and I get moments where I'm like, uh-huh. 
[00:30:00]  But it's like, relatively speaking, no.  I hate it.  I've done it too many times.  I know enough about it now.  And I'm flying an airline, or I try to fly a newer plane.  You know, the odds are.  Yeah.  Yeah, you do a little work just to help out your odds a bit, right?  We have one of the youngest fleets in the industry.  Oh, yeah, Larry Kellner.  Larry Kellner.  You're looking like, uh, Clint Howard.  Yeah.  Gives you that little rah-rah speech about Continental before you take off.  Here's what you've got to watch.  If you're on a Continental flight and you see the CEO, they have the awful video, and the 
[00:30:30]  CEO guy talks, and his lips are really uncomfortable to watch.  Yeah.  But he's so uncomfortable on camera.  His legs crossed.  And his hands are placed on each other.  And watch the way his hands just kind of raise and go back to his knees.  Yeah.  He can't really commit to using his hands.  And they stopped using, like, they used to show a lot more of him, but then they started  just imposing footage of other things that were better to watch, like lost luggage,  people delayed, anything.  Anything.  He stopped showing his dumb, awkward hands raising.  His peanut head.  I'm Larry Kellner. 
[00:31:00]  His hands would raise.  We get it.  You're nervous.  No, it's creepy.  No, it's creepy.  A lot of people are paying attention to the fact that there were long lines at all the airports.  They canceled, what, over 1,000 flights yesterday, American Airlines.  I'm looking at the departure board here.  They have a picture of it in the paper today.  And it says, canceled, canceled, canceled, canceled, canceled.  You get the point, right?  But one flight, now at 10 a.m., who's getting on that plane?  Now at 10 a.m., and that was probably, you know.  But who's getting on that plane?  Because, you know, the airport's abuzz. 
[00:31:30]  Everyone's like, well, they're canceling flights because there might be faulty wiring  in the wheel wells of these planes and blah, blah, blah.  And they have one flight that's willing to take off.  We think the wires are fine in this plane.  F that.  Ah, there are people, though, that don't care.  Ah, get me on it.  It doesn't matter.  What's going to happen is going to happen.  My life's in God's hands.  It's fate.  You know, you could get run over by a street car.  Yeah.  A street car.  Do you know it's more dangerous to drive to the airport than to fly?  Than to fly. 
[00:32:00]  Shut up.  Is it really?  When I get a flat tire, I pull over.  I take no comfort in that.  When my engine stalls on the way to the airport, I slowly pull over onto the shoulder and call  for help and go, oh.  I don't plummet to my death.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Your car comes to a slow stop and the best you get out of yourself is, oh, this sucks.  Yeah, this sucks.  Oh, well.  But the other scenario you get, ah!  Ah!  Ah!  For minutes.  As you spiral.  You scream until you can't scream anymore, and then you die. 
[00:32:30]  So when you tell me that it's more dangerous to drive to the airport than fly, I don't want  to hear it.  Although I use that same effing thing when people talk to me about this.  Is that how you rationalize it when you're going to the airport?  You know, I think it's more dangerous just being here driving.  Yeah, we all do it.  Anyway, and then I guess they, what, they find Southwest 10 million?  Because they weren't checking their planes properly?  Is that what I read today? 
[00:33:00]  So they're taking this very seriously, hopefully?  Let's start all of it, I think, with Southwest got fined.  Yeah.  And nobody wants to get fined.  Yeah.  I think this was, um.  That's a big nut for the airlines right now.  Big one.  I think this is, uh, I think this does have kind of something to do with 9-11.  Because after 9-11, the airline industries were just broke.  And I think they really did start cutting back.  Obviously cutting back on what they gave the passengers.  That's for sure.  No kidding.  But then I think maintenance, too, suffered.  Yeah, they took a, they didn't give them as many wrenches. 
[00:33:30]  They had to take a few wrenches.  Ah, I gotta use a nutcracker on this.  Exactly.  And a butter knife on this screw.  They took my tools away.  But we are in a period of time that, uh, apparently is, uh, some of the safest in, uh, United States aviation history.  Well, they've cut a lot of flights, too.  Don't forget.  So flights are like 80-90% full because they've stopped.  They cut flights.  Yeah.  There's less planes taken off.  Hmm.  All right.  Well, we got that going on in the news today.  So, uh, other, other things.  A fine animator sent us some stills of the animation he's working on for the O&A Animation Festival. 
[00:34:00]  You should know by now it's happening June 5th at the Roseland Ballroom here in New York City.  There's a few tickets left, but they're kind of scattered.  Honestly, I think there's like 20 tickets left.  Yeah.  So you might want to go to ticketmaster.com and, uh.  They're not even in the venue, I think.  Yeah, I think they're outside on the sidewalk.  But one of the, uh, animators sent in some stills.  And I don't even know what, we can't really explain it.  We can't post these.  No.  I guess it's not even worth bringing it up, unfortunately.  But it makes us feel good, uh, knowing that there are people out there animating. 
[00:34:30]  Because, uh, we're putting a lot of faith in the listeners' hands.  This is a listener thing.  Yeah.  Like, when we throw our comedy tour together every summer, we know what we're doing.  We get the comedians.  We work on what we want to do in between the comedians.  We got the whole show planned.  Yeah.  In this case, we're just assuming that we're going to get a bunch of animators coming forward with some great animation.  Yeah.  So, to be honest, we're a little nervous.  So, we've been putting out the word that if you are working on an animation, maybe send in some stills or something. 
[00:35:00]  So, we know that, uh, this whole event is moving in the right direction.  Give us a little hope that people are working on this.  Because if we go there to a sold out, uh, Roseland Ballroom on June 5th, and all of a sudden we're like, uh, we got, we got, like, two animations.  And, uh, uh, it's going to be like, uh, it's going to be like seeing modern English back in the day.  We're going to have to, we're going to have to play I'll Melt With You three or four times.  Hey, you liked that one we just showed you?  We're going to show you again. 
[00:35:30]  Right.  But I'll tell you this much to get you motivated.  We got $10,000 in prize money.  $5,000 for first, $3,000 for second, $2,000 for third.  We're going to have two live comedians.  We're going to have guest judges.  We're going big.  We're trying to get, uh, big celebrity, uh, judges for this thing.  All we ask is if you're working on an animation, A, let us know so we feel a little better about this whole, uh, this whole event we're doing.  And the second thing is, uh, send in your animations, uh, through the mail because we want a nice copy, a real nice, uh, high res copy DVD and, uh, send it out to us. 
[00:36:00]  So when we show it on the big screen, it's going to look as good as it possibly can.  So you can send the animations to Opie and Anthony animation contest, 111 West 57th street, suite 500, New York, New York, one zero zero one nine.  And all that info is up on on a radio.com.  But I guess, uh, today's, uh, headline is simple.  If you're working on something, please let Steve or somebody from the show know.  So we, so we get an idea of what, uh, what's coming in already or what's going to come in.  Okay. 
[00:36:30]  All right.  Uh, the Jesse Vantura thing from the other day is getting a lot of, a lot of, uh, chatter, a lot of attention, some chatter.  Well, you got the nine 11 conspiracy guys.  Uh, they've pretty much jumped on the fact that Jesse was on our show and arguing with, uh, Jimmy for the most part, Jimmy and, uh, Jesse going at it.  Yeah.  He was terrific.  His, his, uh, instincts just really kicked in when he walked around, uh, down at ground zero boy, a mere six and a half to seven years later.  Oh, wait a minute.  Bah.  You know, I was talking to my son about it and, uh, yeah, where are you? 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Good.  He say pointed it to some, uh, lame website.  There was probably loose.  There was probably a loose change or something, but, uh, uh, if you're into talking about the nine 11 conspiracy thing, um, you should go to whack bag.  Cause they're rocking, they're rocking that topic on that.  Yeah.  Or big time.  The Jesse Vantura thing just stimulated that whole conversation.  And, uh, we're getting people from other, just other message boards and other radio shows all coming to, you know, whack bag. 
[00:37:30]  Cause they all heard about the Jesse Vantura, um, interview.  God, they're trying so hard to make it like this 60.  There should be an investigator.  All right.  Into maybe certain failures in communication.  Right.  Gatekeeper.  Yeah.  You know what?  I'm starting to think that, uh, Oswald just got lucky and killed the president of the United States.  Yeah.  Cause I'm, I'm starting to think like, um, in nine 11 terms when nine 11 happened, we were all here.  Everybody, whether you were in New York city or watching on TV, like, wow, planes just took down the twin towers. 
[00:38:00]  It was as obvious as that six years later, you know, some of these, some of these conspiracy theories, they got, I hate to say it.  They got some legs.  I still, I don't, I don't believe it whatsoever, but they got some legs and I'm starting to think back in the day with JFK, I bet you the same thing happened.  It was Oswald, he shot the president, end of story.  But then you start getting a little info here, a little info there.  And next thing you know, it becomes this massive, huge thing. 
[00:38:30]  Man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think you're right.  He just like rattled off some shots, got lucky, got lucky on one of them.  But then all of a sudden somebody came up with one little, little thing that was a little suspicious and that led to this thing that was suspicious.  And then, well, what about the lady with the weird hat on the lawn?  Oh, well, let's add that to this thing.  We saw a puff of smoke.  Puff of smoke from behind the fence.  Well, we'll add that to the thing.  Next thing you know.  A bolt out your rifle.  How the hell could he fire off that many rounds?  Right.  And then a bunch of years go by and then you got this massive conspiracy thing. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  And I'm wondering if the same thing is slowly but surely happening with the 9-11 thing.  Well, there's also been a lot of myths and I don't know all about the JFK conspiracy.  It's like you read it and the way the conspiracy, like a lot of them paint it.  It's like, of course, it would be a conspiracy if it happened that way.  But when you hear certain facts like, well, no, because the lady with the hat felt a bullet whispered a flower.  And you're like, how could the FBI have missed that?  But then you go to like the anti-conspiracy website, like that just simply didn't happen.  Yeah.  It sounds great, but it just didn't happen. 
[00:39:30]  There's a lot of just lies on those sites that are disproven.  Yeah.  By documentation, photographs and records of people that were on site.  Like the loose change comes up with these theories and what they say is fact.  And then you would look at other sites.  It's like, no, here's a picture of a part of the fuselage with the windows in it where they said there were no windows in that plane that hit. 
[00:40:00]  Well, what are these, dummy?  Yeah.  I just disappointed my brother, Elmo.  Oh.  You want to talk about conspiracy theories?  He's all about JFK.  Yeah.  He's all about it.  He spends hours and hours online arguing with these.  He knows everything about it.  And he believes that there was a lot going on that day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He doesn't think it was just Oswald whatsoever.  And he writes today, read the actual Warren Commission testimony. 
[00:40:30]  Who has time to read that?  I get my info from the internet.  A little here, a little there.  How many people heard shots from the knoll?  It's incredible.  According to the Warren Commission, there were a lot of people that heard shots from the grassy knoll that day.  Yeah.  Could have been echoes.  I'm not even saying it wasn't another guy.  I'm not going to say it wasn't Oswald and another guy who just got away.  Could have been echoes on a fence.  You hear that crack, crack, you know, it sounds like more shots because sound travels slow, relatively speaking. 
[00:41:00]  And you could definitely make out the difference in time.  When someone fires a shot and you hear it ricochet off, the sound ricochet off a fence, it's going to sound like it's coming from the fence.  Right.  It's going to sound like two shots, one came from the fence.  There was a good point I read about somebody who was talking about the grassy knoll.  And he was saying that a lot of people, everyone ran towards the knoll after the shot.  And the point was, how many people, when they hear a bullet fired, run towards the gun?  Yeah.  You run away from it.  Yeah.  You don't run towards where the gunman is. 
[00:41:30]  Must run toward gunmen.  And they all ran up the grassy knoll.  Yeah.  So again, I would guess to get away.  But he's right.  People did say they heard a shot.  Maybe that was the easy way out.  Because we all spent some time in Dealey Plaza.  And, you know, if you're in the middle there, you're going to want to run to the outside.  And maybe that was just the closest escape route.  Yeah, it's to the end.  You're running to a place that you can hide.  Yeah.  You can't hide there in Dealey Plaza.  Lay on the yellow line and pretend you're part of the street.  There's nowhere to go.  We should do a JFK show maybe on the other side. 
[00:42:00]  My brother has more knowledge than anyone out there.  Simple as that.  I mean, he will spin your head with what he knows and doesn't know, I guess.  Dude, he better shut up about it.  Yeah, no kidding.  People, you know, come and get him.  Dude, the government's not going to find him.  We can't even find him at this point.  Yeah, where the hell is he?  I don't know.  Our own family doesn't know where he is half the time.  So how is the government going to find him?  They'll follow a T-shirt trail.  Yeah.  By the way, Brother Elmo completed his book.  He put together a fine book that skews TV and movies. 
[00:42:30]  And there's a lot of his cartoons in there.  And he's trying to get a publisher.  He's got some bites.  So we're keeping our fingers crossed for Brother Elmo.  Go to MySpace, Brother Elmo, and you can check out some samples of his book.  It's pretty damn good.  I hope it gets published.  I think that would be really cool for him.  And talk to him about Black Dog Man.  He knows who that is.  He does.  He certainly does.  And how technology has proved that Black Dog Man was two feet tall.  I'll sit you down, Elmo. 
[00:43:00]  We'll talk.  Two feet tall.  Technology is hurting some of the jail-kicking screws and stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, Darren goes, my brother Elmo goes, Zapruder film shows JFK's head violently flying backwards.  Oswald alone is BS.  But they try to explain that, too, right?  No.  Yeah.  We'll never know, man.  Anyway.  This guy has seen Loose Change.  Yes.  I watched the whole thing.  You said you didn't.  Oh, shut up. 
[00:43:30]  I did.  I heard you only did five minutes.  No.  I watched the entire thing.  And then you had to go to the bathroom again.  Yeah.  Crap.  It was Loose Change pouring out.  Tom, go ahead.  Tom, yes?  Yeah.  And listen, you watched Loose Change, right?  Yeah.  I watched the whole thing.  Now, when the planes hit the towers, they left the impression of the wings on the side and  everything, right?  Okay.  Now, when they hit the Pentagon, where's the impression of the wings?  All right.  The Pentagon's made out of brick. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  Very, very tough.  It's a lot tougher than the metal on the outside of the Trade Center.  Also, the plane hit.  Sorry, he's telling you.  He's answering your question.  Dude, the plane hit on an angle.  It didn't hit straight into the Pentagon at a 90-degree angle to the wall.  It hit at an angle that you're not going to get the impression of the silhouette of a 
[00:44:30]  plane.  That's just how it happened.  Do you think it's possible for that 757 to make it all the way through the building like  they showed?  Yeah.  The different layers?  It went through a few rings of the Pentagon.  Yeah.  It's absolutely possible.  The engines?  It did.  And you could see the outline of the plane that they show when you take away the smoke  and stuff.  Because Loose Change likes to show you the picture of the Pentagon with a lot of debris 
[00:45:00]  and stuff in front of the image.  They showed all kinds of stuff about how Osama bin Laden was taken to a hospital by U.S.  people and a bunch of nonsense.  But I'm definitely with Jussie Ventura on a lot of things.  That's terrific.  And if you ran for president, I'd vote.  Yeah, I'm sure you would.  He's a terrific guy.  He can't handle a debate without being a baby and spinning his microphone around and  going, okay, you convinced me.  Yeah, he was getting so...  That's right.  Real presidential material.  Because that's how Clinton or Obama or Reagan would handle it. 
[00:45:30]  You convinced me.  All right, we get it.  We get it.  We get it.  Navy SEAL.  Real knowledge.  We get it.  Yeah, he got really, really frustrated.  And it wasn't like we were...  We'll find out one day.  Yes, we will.  We'll find out one day that what a cruise missile was shot at the Pentagon.  Is that what I'm led to believe?  Yeah, we'll find out one day.  That it was a cruise missile.  It was a plane, just like the planes that hit the building, just like the plane that crashed  in Pennsylvania.  There's another plane.  The guy came in and hit the Pentagon with an airplane. 
[00:46:00]  All right.  Hey, uh...  What about the people?  I love that.  Where did the people go that were on that flight that hit the Pentagon?  And who built the windowless plane with the bombs?  And, like, how did air traffic control...  And I understand the transponders were up, but there's four planes flying around that  took off.  Yeah.  With past...  When did they magically get replaced by the other planes?  Yeah.  Like, okay, so at one point there had to be a shift in the air where the real planes with  the people takes off to kill them, and at perfect timing, the windowless bomb-laden 
[00:46:30]  planes...  Right.  ...have to all appear.  It's still up.  They have to appear, and then where are the people?  Did the government just kill the people?  Did they go, uh, sorry, people, your flight now is being...  We have to land somewhere else.  These armed military people will escort you to a hangar where you'll be executed.  What soldiers did this?  Soldiers are 19.  They can't keep a secret, either.  Listen, uh...  Taking pictures of, uh, uh, prisoners in Iraq with leashes, and that dumb Lindy England 
[00:47:00]  with our thumbs up.  And her...  Stupid...  Her stupid, uh...  What?  I'm just trying to get in here because, uh, we made the Loose Change blog.  Oh.  Uh...  Screw them.  Loose Change, uh, 9-11 blog.  Jim Norton makes me nauseous.  Good.  I'm glad they get nauseous.  Posted April 9th, 2008.  Let me read this.  It's a paragraph.  A while back, I was on the Opie and Anthony show.  Corey had scheduled an interview with an unknown XM radio show.  When I walked into work that morning to pack DVDs, uh, and he was in... 
[00:47:30]  An unknown XM radio show?  When I walked into work that morning to...  Screw off, you dopes.  ...to pack DVDs, and he was in panic mode because he was being attacked at a rampant pace.  Uh, I immediately jumped on the phone and tried to be civil while not realizing what show  I was on.  It wasn't until after I hung up that I realized I had just been berated and cursed out by Jim  Norton.  A physically...  Oh, no.  Sorry, Jim.  Oh, no.  Is he going to make fun of the way I look?  Sorry, Jim.  Oh, no.  I apologize ahead of time before I read the next word. 
[00:48:00]  What?  A physically hideous being...  Hideous?  ...with no talent.  I love the people that just take it to that level.  Aw, what's the matter?  Yeah, no talent.  Okay.  Aw.  What's the matter?  Didn't like the scolding?  Yeah.  Aw.  Who resorts to making jokes about having sex with underage girls.  What?  That's all Jim Norton does?  Doesn't?  That's part of what I do.  Part of it?  Part.  Sure.  A small part if you put it all together.  I love writing jokes like that.  Right.  I don't resort to them.  I start off with them.  You dummies. 
[00:48:30]  Little children looking for mommy and daddy's love.  I want to solve the crime.  I'm going to be somebody.  Yeah, man.  And then it continues.  Be warned.  The audio in this clip is full of language not appropriate for youngsters.  I wonder if they show the same warning when they show the 9-11 footage.  People handle planes going through the building.  Yeah.  They can handle me cursing you out, little child.  So they got that audio of when Loose Change was on our show back in the day.  They stunk.  And they couldn't defend their point.  No, not at all.  They never do.  They stunk.  And then after the link for the clip, it says, so why bring it up at this point? 
[00:49:00]  Wow.  Jesse Ventura was in studio.  I'm telling you, our Jesse Ventura interview, it's got legs.  It's starting to spread around.  But I was in studio with these clowns the other day and schooled them.  Again, just a little.  Are you crazy?  He schooled us?  He knows he's going to.  Jesse Ventura did not school.  I was pretty much out of that segment.  Did not school Anthony and Jim Norton.  The guy went like this with his microphone because he was frustrated because he was losing so bad. 
[00:49:30]  That's why, I got an email from a guy who's a 9-11 conspiracy guy.  He and I always go back and forth, whatever.  But he goes, Jesse didn't know what he was talking about because he knew Jesse made an ass of himself.  But it figures that the little blog boy on that site would say that because that's what a little boy does.  They side with whatever their side is.  Jesse won.  Jesse won.  Jesse showed them.  But he didn't.  And you know he didn't.  He couldn't back anything up.  Right.  He's coming up with these cockamamie, harebrained ideas. 
[00:50:00]  We got a break, but let me get the rest of this in here.  Well, Jesse Ventura was in the studio with these clowns the other day and schooled them.  Sure, he's a much more physically imposing guy than myself.  It was looking these guys in the eyes, but his mind is just as imposing.  While most people are focusing on his appearance on Hattie and Combs, I think this is a true gem.  And then he has the audio.  How much of the audio does he have?  Because another site only had a clip of our interview with Jesse Ventura where Jesse was making a bunch of points without us counteracting his points. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, we actually allowed him to speak.  Exactly.  Uninterrupted.  Jeez.  Screw us.  And the interview has made its way to FARC.com.  It was on the front page yesterday.  Supposedly BREAK.com might throw it on their front page today or tomorrow.  So this thing's got legs.  If you want to go to loosechange911.com slash blog and see what this clown wrote about Norton,  and if you want to see the video of the Jesse Ventura interview, that's up there as well. 
[00:51:00]  But I'm sure it's only a piece.  I don't think they would post the whole thing.  I'm glad I make you nauseous.  What you're trying to do, you stink, and you're just little children trying to prove an unprovable point because you want to be different.  And you can't just handle the fact that, yeah, that's what happened, and it sucked.  They caught us with our pants down, and you don't like that.  No one could deal with that.  Not no one, but these conspiracy guys.  They can't just deal with the fact that, hey, we screwed up.  Well, what about all the security? 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, exactly.  What about it?  It's screwed up.  Why don't the FBI and the CIA talk?  I don't know.  Apparently should have.  Yeah.  How are these savages allowed to come into the country on student visas?  I don't know.  They should have been able to.  Jesse the Body says they should all be allowed in.  Of course.  No borders.  If I was president, there wouldn't be borders.  We'd allow everybody in.  That's good.  Yeah, good.  Good policy.  Yeah, let's go with John in New York.  John.  Guys, I think the guy with the airplane comment had a valid point because I saw it on Bugs Bunny. 
[00:52:00]  He ran right through the wall and left the perfect outline of himself in the wall.  Yeah, that's what they expected.  He's getting his knowledge from cartoons.  So, this all leads to a fine production piece that Derek did for us.  It's called, And Justice for Brawl.  For one night only, two heavyweights will do battle in a steel cage.  Only one man will walk out with his wits intact.  When Jesse the Body Ventura takes on slugneck Jimmy Norton. 
[00:52:30]  All I can say is that, and I have no background that you guys have, certainly, as a Navy SEAL.  I know you're a Navy SEAL.  Wait, I'm answering your question.  But you're not, you're saying I'm not a Navy SEAL.  What's that got to do with it?  Opie and Anthony present, Conspiracy Mania 6.  And Justice for Brawl.  Here we go.  Anything goes.  Why is it that when you're asking questions that are speculative and I ask a question, you get angry?  Why are you getting angry? 
[00:53:00]  Oh, yeah, look out here.  All I'm doing is asking questions.  I know, but I'm saying that we're trying to give some kind of common sense answers, and we give a common sense answer.  Oh, yeah.  You can try to out-yell me if you all laugh at what you want.  There is your failure.  It's not out-yelling you, but you ask a question.  You throw a question out, and I try to answer or re-speculate, and then you go, okay, time.  I guess you're an experienced guy that would know me.  Look at this!  Oh, my God!  It's not just common sense, like you said.  You use common sense.  I ain't no Navy SEAL, but I have common sense. 
[00:53:30]  He told you!  This is going to be a brawl!  See it live.  Nowhere.  Because it already happened.  It's Conspiracy Mania 6.  And justice for brawl.  Ah!  Oh, my God!  I'm on fire!  Do it on me!  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Good morning to everybody.  Good morning to the faithful.  The phone number is 877-212-ONDA. 
[00:54:00]  Write that down.  You're going to need it one of these days.  Um.  Tippi Tom is in the house.  Tippi Tom is in the house!  Yeah, and the house stinks.  Smelling worse than ever.  Our homeless friend.  He's going to be on the radio in about 15 minutes.  Uh.  I think he's, uh, the favorite guest of all the staff.  Except Anthony.  Uh.  Except Anthony. 
[00:54:30]  I love this guy.  He smells so bad.  Smells bad.  But has just, uh, just a great personality.  I love this guy.  It's a nauseating, heavy, thick smell.  Horrible.  What's up?  What's up, Danny?  Tippi is, he's always in such a good mood.  He saw me, and he's like, I remember you.  He's like, I remember you too.  And then he's looking at the floor of the lobby of the building.  And he's like, oh, man, what a nice floor. 
[00:55:00]  He looks like a bed.  His legs are rotting off his body, and he's just happy to be alive.  And it should be noted, too, Danny does the best Tippi Tom impression on staff.  So, I try.  Um.  Couple things.  I'm thinking.  I'm thinking we bring back the tongue scraping bit today with Tippi Tom.  God.  Oh, God.  What do you say, Jim?  Uh, I can't even.  What do you say, Jim? 
[00:55:30]  Fathom.  Are you up for some fun?  Are you up for some fun?  I gotta get on a plane today.  There's no way I'm doing anything with my nose.  No.  Although, it wouldn't surprise me if Big Ace was worse, because he has so much alcohol  going down.  It might be killing the bad breath.  I'm sure it's not killing it, but I mean, as much booze as goes down there.  Yeah, but do you think he's brushing his teeth?  Good point.  No.  Not a lot.  Not a lot.  And the crap he's eating and just.  Well, I say.  He's eating garbage.  Good point.  I already said Steve for a tongue scraper, so we're going to do something with that. 
[00:56:00]  That tongue scraper is going to look like.  Yeah.  You ever see one of those cheese slicers that you slowly skim over the top of the cheese  and it just comes curling off?  That'll be pieces of his tongue.  That's what it's going to look like.  Just pieces of his tongue falling off into the tongue scraper.  Or we could do, we line up the guys and have them smell Tippi Tom's butt.  Through the clothes.  Through the clothes.  Because I hear the clothes are horrific.  Yes, Keith.  How bad's the leg?  The legs are bad. 
[00:56:30]  One of them looks twice as big as when we had him up here last time.  And that's only.  All right.  Look.  I have it.  Look.  I know most of us have black hearts on this show, but we got to save Tippi Tom's legs.  How are we going to do this?  How do we do this?  I don't think he could.  You don't think you could save his legs at this point?  He doesn't.  Because there's a lot of people when we talk about how big his legs are and stuff,  they start calling like, you got to save his legs.  He's going to lose his legs.  But Tippi Tom, after he loses his legs, he'll just come wheeling in here in a wheelchair.  On one of those skateboards with weights in his hand. 
[00:57:00]  He won't even care.  He genuinely does love coming up here.  He gets really excited.  I love when he's here.  And, you know, but I think he, after all this time, either he's just, his memory is just  totally shot from drinking too much.  Or he was like hitting the head with a brick at some point.  Because he literally, he can't remember 30 minutes ago.  Right.  I mean, I found him.  I said, okay, stay here.  I'm going to get you some clothes.  I came back.  He's gone.  30 minutes later.  And then I find him wandering the streets. 
[00:57:30]  I go, where were you?  He goes, oh, you stopped by to see me yesterday.  Oh, he's like, that's a great way to live, though, man.  It was 30 minutes ago.  30 minutes.  I just saw you.  He lives just like your pet.  You leave your house for five minutes and the pet thinks you've been gone a week.  And then you come back.  I gave him the clothes and it was like this real nice leather jacket.  So then I found him.  Of course, he didn't have the leather jacket already.  And it was only half an hour later from that.  And I go, where's the leather jacket?  He says, well, the leather jacket you gave me two days ago.  I traded it.  I wore it for two days and I traded it.  And I go, he had it on for a half hour? 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, half hour, 20 minutes.  Wow.  And he traded it with somebody.  Someone just took it from him, probably.  No, he got a nice coat in exchange.  He did good.  How about this?  People come in and we lift up his pant leg and they have to put their nose under his pant  leg and breathe.  Yeah, we'll figure it out.  I can't even handle talking about this.  We'll figure it out.  We'll figure it out.  But Tibby Tom's going to be on the show in about five or ten minutes.  Now, before we get there, you want to get pissed off or you want to have a little 
[00:58:30]  fun right now?  Pissed off or fun?  Your choice.  Both will be entertaining.  Want to get pissed off first and have fun?  Yeah, that's good.  All right.  Let's get pissed off first.  All right.  It's amazing that, well, there's no surprise, actually, that this is happening in America.  But listen to this.  Well, there is an urgent need for firefighters in the West to battle about ten and major wildfires.  The Denver Channel dot com reports many of the new recruits are Hispanics who speak 
[00:59:00]  only Spanish.  And in Oregon, that means that some of the supervisors who speak only English are being  laid off or demoted.  Because in Oregon, a crew boss is required to be able to speak the language of the firefighters,  even if it's only one worker on a 20-person crew.  The state says the rule is necessary for safety reasons, so why not require the workers to speak  English?  The state has no clear answer on that.  Guys are getting demoted because they can't speak Spanish.  I know, Geraldo is right. 
[00:59:30]  He wasn't being a defensive prick when he sat there.  He was right.  Geraldo is right.  We were wrong.  They're learning it at a faster rate than any other group.  You just did a Jesse the Body.  What?  Geraldo was right.  Oh, yeah, no, he was 100%.  He's not here.  Stupid yellow glasses, right?  We got to get Geraldo back on.  You just play that story for him.  No surprise, right?  That is ridiculous.  Even if there's only one person on the crew that speaks Spanish, you need a Spanish-speaking  supervisor.  That, yeah, welcome. 
[01:00:00]  Welcome to our third world country in the making.  You're watching it.  You're watching the crumbling of an empire.  You know when you look back at Rome and you think, hmm, I wonder what that was like?  Such a strong empire and then just brought down and crumbled.  I wonder what it was like when it finally came down.  Well, sit and watch.  Just watch.  That's what's happening to the United States.  We are becoming a third world nation. 
[01:00:30]  Because no one wants to stand up because they're afraid of being tagged a racist or xenophobe.  You just, you can't say anything.  You can't speak out against these things or you get a group on your ass and they get you  fired.  So we're going to sit and watch as there's an influx of people that don't assimilate to 
[01:01:00]  the country, to the way of American life.  And we become a nation of, I don't know, uneducated, politically correct savages.  But no, it's American white paranoia.  We made up the thing that a lot of people don't speak English in the country.  We made that up.  Just created it.  It's not from daily experience.  No.  We made that all up.  Silly.  So there you go.  Well, you were right there. 
[01:01:30]  Told you.  That was the pissed off part.  It is what it is.  You don't have to do too much radio on that.  No.  It's amazing that it's going down.  Well, we'll bring everybody back with a very hot story.  Listen to this.  A 47-year-old man is caught in his boxer shorts in a Super 8 motel with two girls.  Oh.  This guy sounds natural when he talks.  A 47-year-old man is caught in his boxer shorts in a Super 8 motel with two girls.  They're ages 15 and 16.  Now, this creep was giving them wine.  Wine.  You sure he wasn't 44? 
[01:02:00]  44.  44.  44.  He was a 44-year-old man.  44.  A 16-year-old.  We got a Hispanic that agrees with us.  Well, really fast.  Let's go to Diego in Miami.  Diego, of course you're calling from Miami.  What's up?  How you doing, guys?  Hey, man.  I'm originally Colombian.  Yeah, I think it's ridiculous.  People don't learn English.  I came here like seven or eight years ago.  I've been busting my ass trying to talk the best that I can and trying to... 
[01:02:30]  Were you Mule and Coke from Colombia when you came in?  What do you think?  No, I'm...  You know, not everybody, but, you know, I'm completely 100% with you guys.  You're, you know, people in Miami, most of them, they don't even speak, you know, Spanish and, you know...  I mean, English, I mean, and, you know, it's ridiculous.  Just want to say I completely agree with you guys.  All right, thanks.  Thank you, sir.  I think you fully expect to have a lot of people speaking Spanish in Miami because it's way, way down there. 
[01:03:00]  But when it's affecting, where was it, Colorado?  Oregon.  Oregon.  Oregon, even worse.  Oregon.  They're also a very, very liberal, tolerant area.  Oh, very.  True.  That's what you get.  Enjoy.  True.  All right, let's get back to the hot story.  I'm going to start over so we get all the hotness in.  A 47-year-old man is caught in his boxer shorts in a Super 8 motel with two girls.  They're ages 15 and 16.  Now, this creep was giving them wine coolers, cognac, pot. 
[01:03:30]  And, again, one of them's 15.  There's still an innocence there.  When he asked them, hey, what movie do you want to watch in the room?  They picked Alvin and the Chipmunks.  What did he order?  Porn.  And here's the kicker of all kickers.  The guy's an elementary school principal.  Oh, wow.  Okay, that is the kicker.  This guy is a classic.  Oh.  Yeah, but it sounds like that the girls didn't mind that he decided on the porn instead of  Alvin and the Chipmunks.  Yeah, he's just in his boxers hanging out.  Alvin and the Chipmunks, eh, why don't we watch something else? 
[01:04:00]  Well, why are the girls there in the first place?  Yeah, who are they?  Like, the guy is outraged that they wanted to watch Alvin and the Chipmunks and the guy  put porn on.  How did he get them in there?  Yeah, how did he get to that stage?  And what retarded 16-year-old wants to watch Alvin and the Chipmunks?  Yeah.  What a dumb kid.  A little baby.  I didn't see them at five, but you're 16, you want to watch Alvin and the Chipmunks?  You're dope.  How do you think the guy got caught?  Let me think.  Let me think. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, probably somebody at the motel ratted him out.  He sent one of the girls out for something.  Well, he had to send you the other one.  He was going to get away with this one, but it's a classic example of sucks to be you.  Oh, no.  Not even on Lucky Lottery.  This is so obvious that it's a sucks to be you story.  This is how he got caught.  What the heck was going on in that hotel room, anyway?  Well, I tell you.  What do you think was going on in that hotel, you dumb?  What the heck?  That's a creep. 
[01:05:00]  What the heck was going on in that hotel room, anyway?  Well, I tell you, it was shocking to us, too.  Luckily, there was an officer in that area.  That was his area.  He was on the overnight shift, and he just took a quick walk through the hotel.  When he did that, he could smell marijuana coming from this particular room.  All the guy needed was a towel.  What is he doing?  A little wet towel to put under the door?  He forgot the wet towel.  Oh, blow it through the vent.  Oh, what are you doing?  A rookie mistake, sir. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  Coming from this particular room, we knocked on the door,  and this suspect answered the door at that point.  So he answers.  We got the detail.  He was in his boxer shorts.  Did he fight, or was he so loaded on cognac and pot, he just gave up?  No, he actually.  What a dope.  Was he so loaded on cognac and pot?  What an idiot.  What, were the girls just sprawled out on the bed, too, and they opened the door?  What's going on? 
[01:06:00]  I'd be like, hey, could you hide?  Kevin from Connecticut, very good.  This reporter is a Chris Hansen wannabe.  Yeah.  Loaded on cognac and pot, he just gave up.  No, he actually was pretty cooperative.  We asked if we could come in, and he said yes.  And at this point, when the officers went into the hotel room,  there was a pornographic movie playing at this point,  and then the officers saw the two young girls,  and at that point, they thought, this is more than a drug marijuana issue. 
[01:06:30]  There's a lot more here.  Oh, really?  Wouldn't you put your clothes on and turn the porn off when the cops show up?  That's what that peephole's there for.  Don't think, sir.  Take a quick look to see what's outside the door.  You don't answer.  You hush the girls up.  Dude, yeah.  Hesh up.  You're breaking about 20 laws, and you just open up your room like, hey, what's up?  Wouldn't you be a little paranoid?  You're right.  Take a little piece.  Like, really on guard.  You would be right on guard, especially if you're smoking pot. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, who's this?  He's the only guy that doesn't get paranoid when he smokes pot.  Hey, come on in.  Fine.  What, cops?  Come on in.  Yeah, I got porn, con, cognac.  What do you want?  You want some cognac with some pot?  You want a young girl?  Drugs.  What do you need?  The girls are barely clothed.  Come on in.  What do you need?  Obviously, he wasn't smoking the pot.  You want to watch porn or Alvin and the Chipmunks?  What do you need?  You have the girls put their clothes on.  You dump the pot.  You quietly dump the pot.  Why did you do that? 
[01:07:30]  They weren't going to find it, Karen.  That Alvin and the Chipmunks DVD is all we had.  We needed that.  Just opening the door.  I'm sure he was taking pictures of his victims.  We shouldn't be surprised at that.  Yes.  I mean, that's the scary part of many frightening things here.  The guy's an elementary school principal.  And real quick, I want to just read a brief statement here.  This was a letter that he had sent to elementary school parents. 
[01:08:00]  Talk about just trying to snow people.  Why all the stingers?  Xiong.  That's probably when the letter came up.  Like the graphic of the letter came up on the screen.  Xiong.  You could hear in their voices that they're kind of turned on a little bit by this.  Yeah, a little titillated.  To read a brief statement here.  This was a letter that he had sent to elementary school parents.  Talk about just trying to snow people.  He said, every minute we spend with our children in love, impact them in ways that cannot be measured.  Well.  The old adage rings true. 
[01:08:30]  The best thing we can give our kids is our presents.  Oh, really?  Your presents.  In your boxers.  Pouring cognac down their throats.  Do you think he was pouring it down?  Open.  Open.  Open your mouth.  What the heck?  Just pouring it down.  This guy can't sell the story, man.  He can't sell it.  He's really trying to be disgusted.  He protested too much.  Yeah, it's almost like you don't need to show outrage because the story is bad enough.  Right.  The story is bad enough.  You don't have to, like, punch it up with this, oh, my God. 
[01:09:00]  You know, I wish it was me that was in there in my box.  I mean, oh, did I say that?  Yeah, I got to hear the last part again.  You're right, Jimmy.  It is what it is.  Like, he's trying to pump it up, and then it's just not working.  Because the story, like, the letter is bad enough, and then he's, like, reading it, like,  we're all going to hear it and go, yeah, I agree with that letter.  That's a good point, sir.  Oh, you're right.  Right.  We see the inconsistency.  We get it.  Yeah, don't worry.  It cannot be measured.  The old adage rings true.  The best thing we can give our kids is our presence. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  And your boxers.  And your boxers.  Pouring cognac down their throats.  Yeah, because that's what was happening.  And turning them over on their bellies and slowly spanking their behinds.  Right.  And then pulling their hair.  Right.  He just gets into things that had nothing to do with the story.  Like the teenage girls weren't willingly drinking the...  Maybe putting them in the shower and all showering together and soaping each other up. 
[01:10:00]  Forcing their mouths open and blowing pot smoke down their throats.  Yeah.  While I pick their nose.  While he pick their nose.  This cognac's a nice beverage.  Yeah.  Charles Emerson Winchester of this guy.  Yeah.  Oh, you want some cognac?  It's not like it brought Zima.  Let's listen for Oh Really again.  Give our kids is our presence.  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  Isolate the hell out of that and put it on a machine.  You keep...  Oh, really?  You keep repeating and I gotta stop. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, really?  The best thing we can give our kids is our presence.  Oh, really?  Your presence and your boxers pouring cognac down their throats.  Am I the only one picturing Angry Vince here?  What?  Well, because he's like, you know, forcing cognac down their throats.  Cognac down their throats?  What is he doing?  Hey, he's in his boxers pouring cognac down their throats.  Well, actually, I'm thinking the guy in the hotel is Angry Vince. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, I'm with the girls.  Yes, forcing all this debauchery on them.  You two girls are gonna drink my cognac, aren't you?  That's right.  Open your mouth.  I'm gonna pour it down your throats.  I'm gonna pour it down your goddamn throats.  Ding dong.  Oh, what was this?  Ding dong.  Hello?  Everything all right in there?  Yeah, what the hell do you want?  What the hell do you think you're doing? 
[01:11:30]  I'm trying to smoke pot and pour cognac down your girls' throats.  Get on your knees.  And you're coming in here.  What was this stupid cop wrestler?  Oh, wow.  The big boss.  I'll get the big boss man after you.  That's right.  I know some police officers like the big boss man.  Is he dead?  Yeah, he's one of the many that have died.  A banana.  Take that bra off.  Take it off now.  Take it off now.  Take that training bra off and take it off now. 
[01:12:00]  I want you to crawl around in your hands and knees.  That's right.  Crawl around and watch out for the chip box.  Everything all right in there?  Everything's fine.  But I smell a pot out in the hall.  It was a fireworks display from my entrance.  Don't worry about it.  You relax.  I'm in my box of shorts.  That's right.  I'm in my boxes.  And I'm going to pull down my pants to show you I've buffed my ass.  And you can kiss my ass. 
[01:12:30]  Come on.  Come on.  This guy just lost his mind.  This elementary principal.  He just lost his mind.  A principal.  He lost his mind.  Corn and pot and cognac.  That's wonderful.  He's probably in a frenzy.  Whipped up into a froth at his house going, what do I have?  I have some cognac.  Right.  I've got to buy some pot for these girls.  He's getting all prepared for his little rendezvous.  Rendezvous.  That's what I always think about when I think of these stories. 
[01:13:00]  It's not so much the story and when it's happening and what happened and the evidence they have.  But what was happening beforehand when this guy was prepping the whole thing?  Yeah.  Got the cognac.  Should I wear these boxers?  They should like this.  I'll pop a Viagra.  Go to the hotel.  When should I pop my Viagra?  Two hours before, I'm thinking, maybe?  Yeah.  I'll teach them a lesson.  All right.  I got to go drive into the colored neighborhood to get some pot. 
[01:13:30]  This is the most dangerous part of the whole thing.  But it's worth it.  Is it?  It's worth it.  It's certainly worth it.  And then I just picture him being arrested.  And any time one of these guys get arrested, I just picture William H. Macy on the bed at  the end of Fargo.  No!  No!  Getting handcuffed.  Because you know these guys have no bravery or anything.  It's not like, hey, mother effer.  Yeah, you handcuffed me.  Another reason why you just don't open the door when the cop is knocking.  Yeah.  Because at least if you look through the peephole and you know I am so effed.  Yeah.  You might as well go and do some of that. 
[01:14:00]  You know.  You think you're going to get some in there?  At that point, you know, you have nothing to lose.  Go so broke.  Look, ladies, I figure I have about two minutes left here.  Can you help me out?  That's enough time to go twice.  Right.  Because I'm going away for a long time.  Can you help a guy out here?  You're right, though.  He has to get it all together for his business.  Yeah, he's got to think about it.  He's rendezvous.  He's probably all excited. 
[01:14:30]  He's just walking around and he can't even walk.  He's trying to buy some cognac and the guy at the liquor store is looking down at his  pants going, where the hell is he going?  Wait, now what else did he buy?  Just alcohol in general?  It was wine coolers, I think.  Was it wine coolers?  Oh, the young girls like the wine coolers.  So what do you buy first?  You buy the condoms?  You got to think condoms.  Condoms?  This guy's got to go condoms.  The hell are those?  He's got to go condoms, I'm thinking.  They still make those?  He's got to go condoms.  You don't want any proof that he had, you know, had sex with these girls.  One of them gets pregnant and, boy, is he really in trouble, man. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, that perv switch is evil, isn't it?  That perv switch is an evil, evil thing.  We all have it.  He's a principal just walking around the halls looking at them all with their little bellies  shirts.  He's probably...  They're all shown with their little sweatpants with their stuff written on their ass.  Yeah.  And he's just walking around the halls going, yeah, I'm the principal.  It's a whole career I've worked toward my entire life.  I started off as a teacher.  Yeah.  Worked my way up.  I'm pretty proud of my career as principal. 
[01:15:30]  And it allows me to see and help guide a lot of...  I need that ass!  Oh, my God!  He's 14!  Hotel Cognac Pot!  You know what the sad part is?  The guy's probably been working on this scenario for well over a year.  Oh, yeah.  Planning it out.  He finally gets it all to work.  He pulled it all together.  It's all together.  And he gets caught by some pot smoke.  Yeah, let's say hi to Brian in East Meadow.  Brian.  Morning, guys. 
[01:16:00]  Good morning.  And the reporter, he sounds like just a little bit too excited, like he's trying to cover  up how turned on he is.  Of course.  He's in that little, like, sigh of everything he's saying, you know?  Yeah.  He knows it's hot.  He knows it's hot.  I mean, you know, he knows it's wrong, but he also knows it's a bit hot.  Yeah, that's why he's reporting it.  Yeah.  For God's sake.  Yeah, he doesn't give a crap about this.  All the girls or the pot or is it Cognac or his boxers?  He doesn't care.  Right.  All right, boys.  Ron and Fett, two to three. 
[01:16:30]  Punch it out.  All right.  Let's go to Jesse in Jersey.  Jesse.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  You guys are missing the tie-in to one of your stories from the Hall of Fame.  The one with the principal that got caught in his office all hopped up on the crystal  meth.  One of my...  I can't even say one of.  It's probably my favorite teacher story ever.  It just snowballed into a bigger story.  Every detail that came in about this guy, it just got worse and worse.  It was bad to start with.  It's my favorite teacher story.  Can we find it real fast, Iraq, or is it going to take time? 
[01:17:00]  Look at Iraq.  It's going to take a little bit.  He'll find it, though.  We'll do it after the break.  He loves the garlic butter sauce.  Thanks.  Where is...  It has to happen now.  What do we got, Steve?  Steve's handing me a note, but we definitely have to break.  There's no way we can't break.  Hey, what do you got?  I just spoke to Tippy Tom's brother, and he's on his way to a meeting, but he's got about  10 minutes to spare.  We can't do it right now.  I know.  All right.  I'll call him.  I'll see if I can...  We'll do it right after the break.  I'm telling you.  I know.  I know.  I know.  We'll do it right after the break. 
[01:17:30]  All right.  We got Tippy Tom.  He's going to come in next.  And Tippy Tom's brother has been trying to find Tippy Tom for the longest of time.  And it's just trying to get him on the phone and Tippy Tom in the studio is like  trying to get planets to a line.  I think his brother will be late for a meeting so he can talk to his long-lost brother that  he's been trying to find for years.  Trying to find?  Just get a bloodhound.  Point him toward a pile of crap and then say, find this.  Let's take the break then.  Let's do it.  If we can only get 10 minutes.  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  Jimmy's frustrated. 
[01:18:00]  I think it's amazing, actually.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi.  We're here.  Thanks for checking us out today.  We appreciate that.  We got Tippy Tom outside the studio.  Our homeless friend is about to enter.  Oh, God.  And I don't know, like commercial radio at times really, really, really sucks because  we had no choice.  We had to go to a break. 
[01:18:30]  Tippy Tom's brother has been trying to find Tippy Tom for a very long time.  What's been going on behind the scenes, he got a hold of the radio show.  He's been talking to Steve, this guy, and he wanted, Steve, what do we know about Tippy  Tom's brother trying to contact Tippy Tom?  Uh, I got contacted back in, uh, a couple of months ago, and, uh, I guess, I don't  want to give away too much because I'll let, uh, when this, when this unfolds, I'll  let it happen, but Tippy Tom used to be a successful, uh, uh, businessman in Reno, 
[01:19:00]  and his brother lives in Jersey.  What kind of business?  Uh, window washing.  Sorry, his brother won't wait a minute?  Wait.  His brother's got a meeting to go to.  We might be able to do it later.  We might be able to do it later.  He's got a meeting to go to.  The guy's, you know, the responsible part of the Tippy Tom family.  So, Tippy Tom used to have a window cleaning business in Reno that was very successful.  He had a wife.  Uh-huh.  He's, uh, had a kid that's about 13 years old now.  Uh-huh.  And, um, let's see, what used to be very health conscious, which is probably why he survived 
[01:19:30]  on the street so long, uh, which is, uh, much different than what we know.  Uh, apparently he has met, uh, Barry Manilow on, on a couple of occasions.  That was verified.  Uh, and...  What, what was the meeting of...  Yeah, what the hell?  What was that about, meeting Barry Manilow?  What's that?  He said he lived with Barry Manilow outside.  He said he had a dog named Bagel.  He lived with Barry Manilow. 
[01:20:00]  Well, there have been, you know...  Oh, well, you're getting...  Because Tippy says he's kind of, you know, gay.  See, Tippy had no idea who I was talking to, and probably still doesn't.  Uh, but I was getting coherent information in the left ear and screaming in the right  ear.  It's like...  You're like the polar opposite.  I love it.  And as...  The problem was, as, uh, as his brother heard the screaming, he just got less and less interested  in, in dealing with him, because, like I said, he's got a meeting to go to.  He might, uh, we might be able to get him on the phone on the XM side.  So you were trying to make the connection, and...  Absolutely. 
[01:20:30]  And the brother decided that a meeting is way more important than talking to his long-lost brother,  that he's been trying to hunt down for a very long time, because he's been calling you  behind the scenes.  Right.  All right, what are we going to do about that?  We'll, we'll try to get the meeting on another day, then?  We could try to get it later, later on today.  Uh, or, uh...  Or on his day.  And why does the brother, uh, want to get a hold of Tippy Tom?  Uh, he's got some news to give him.  Ooh.  Oh, very interesting.  Yeah.  Is it good?  Are they trying to clean him up?  No, I know the news.  I was just doing it for the radio, you dummy. 
[01:21:00]  Uh, because they don't know out there.  Right, okay.  Um, I don't know in here.  Sorry, I didn't mean to call you a dummy.  You could squash me like a grape.  Uh, it's much easier to call E-Rock a dummy than you, Steve.  Yes, it is.  Let's acknowledge that.  Um, all right.  Shaped like a grape.  Are they going to try to clean him up or anything?  Are they going to try to get him help?  Are they going to try to save his legs?  I think...  What's the long...  I don't think they know a lot about him.  I really don't, uh, you know, we've...  We've given him a little bit of information about him, but, uh, you know, I've been...  I've spoken to his brother via email a few times, and this is the first time I was able 
[01:21:30]  to actually get him on the phone.  How important is this meeting?  Um...  Because I hear he kind of, like, he's in the listening area.  He could be here within an hour and, and, and see what his brother's, uh, been up to.  I think I caught him off guard when I, uh, when I called him, and he just says he wasn't  prepared for it, and he's sort of, uh, a little bit anxious.  But, you know, if he has, uh, maybe if he has a couple, uh, a little bit to compose himself,  you know, he'll be ready to do it.  I guess he hasn't talked to him in about 11 years. 
[01:22:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  Why is Keith laughing?  He's standing out there screaming at the poster, you guys, and he's looking at Anthony going,  and you look like a Vulcan!  A Vulcan!  Ha, ha, ha, Vulcan!  How can he not love this guy?  I could care less he smells.  This guy gives us the best radio.  Oh, God, that's hysterical.  I think he gives us the best radio out of all these crazy characters behind the scenes.  All right, let's, uh, let's get Tippi Tom in studio.  He's been waiting out there.  Open that door.  Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time in a few months easily, it's, uh, Tippi Tom. 
[01:22:30]  Tippi!  Tippi!  I do not like...  Come here.  He doesn't like your hair.  Come here.  He's still talking to me, the poster version of me?  The poster.  Oh.  Man, man, man, man.  All right, here he is.  Tippi!  What's up, Tippi?  There he is.  All right.  All right, Tippi Tom back in town.  All right.  Hey, Tippi, you were looking at our poster outside the studio. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  That doesn't sound good at all.  You all right, Tippi?  Tippi, what's the matter?  I'm dying.  I'll be dead.  I'm out of this world.  I want you to all pray for me.  I'm dying.  I'll say, Tippi, we love you.  Why I go up in space.  Now, what I'm saying is this. 
[01:23:30]  I'm dying.  I don't feel like dying right now.  Right.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm on Earth.  And I want to stay here for a little bit more time because I feel like being here.  But that cough sounds a little bad.  What sounds bad?  The cough.  You were just coughing pretty bad.  Yeah, I just coughed a little bit.  So what?  You never cough?  What are you telling me?  You don't cough anymore? 
[01:24:00]  What?  You lost your cough?  Oh, shit.  What the hell's wrong with you?  No, wait a minute.  So what?  Some people cough once in a while.  Yeah.  So I cough.  Fuck.  I need you to.  Whoa.  Let's.  Watch my big mouth.  Okay, I apologize, everybody, for saying a bad word.  My mama slapped me in my face for saying what I just said.  But thank God my mom's not here. 
[01:24:30]  But anyway, what I'm saying is that what's going on?  Wait, what do you mean by thank God your mom's not here?  Because if I said the word I just said, she slapped me in my face.  Yeah.  No.  I can't curse.  Remember when.  At all.  That his brother had some news.  No.  Tom.  Yeah.  That news would be that his mother is no longer living.  Oh, no.  I can't do that. 
[01:25:00]  No.  Because I'll get in trouble.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When I stuck my tongue at my mom, I got so much trouble, I was only stretching for two  weeks.  Well, Tippi, I have a feeling you could stick your tongue out at your mom and I think she's  going to be all right with it.  Well, now she might like it.  Huh?  Well, my mom got a sense of humor, so she might like it.  Well, I don't think so.  I don't think so either.  Yeah.  I would imagine that sense of humor is a bit dry. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  Come on.  A very dry sense of humor.  Oh, that's awful.  I was 12 years old.  You know, what the hell do I know that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Come on.  When was the last time you saw her?  You never stuck your tongue at your mom?  Well, no.  Well, that's all.  You're perfect.  Maybe in bed.  I'm so happy.  Everybody's perfect.  Well, I did.  When was the last time you saw your mom?  Oh, my God.  That was about 20 something years ago. 
[01:26:00]  Okay, it just crept over here.  I knew it was going to ooze over here.  Well, my mom's still living, by the way.  I know that.  Oh, boy.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  But she's like 80 years old.  Wow.  Wow.  That's a...  Yeah.  Wow.  She said, I want to outlive my kids.  Well.  Well.  Oops.  Well, she is.  No. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  We're waiting for our children to die first.  Oh, yeah?  That's what they...  My mother told me that.  We're waiting for you kids to die first.  I got five brothers.  Oh, sometimes.  Things don't pan out.  No.  One sister.  Mm-hmm.  One sister.  That's it, huh?  That's it.  What does she do?  Uh, Robin became a veterinarian.  Oh.  Yes.  And, um, uh, Richie, he, uh, he worked for the sanitation department. 
[01:27:00]  Uh, let's see.  Uh, Johnny built houses.  Uh.  Johnny built houses.  The older brother.  Yeah.  The oldest one.  Mm-hmm.  And then, um, let's see.  I come down the line and say, uh, Chris, he played guitar.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, he want to be a rock star or some shit like that.  Whoa.  Well, so do you.  Whoa. 
[01:27:30]  Whoa.  So, your brother wants to be a rock star, but you do, too.  Well, I...  I already am.  You sing?  Yeah, of course you are.  I can play the violin if you want.  Well, we don't have a violin here.  I've heard you sing a song, though.  I ain't got no violin.  Oh, you want to hear a song?  Yeah.  Yeah, let's hear a song.  A little tune.  Okay, uh, you want to hear, uh...  I bet it's going to be Rod Stewart.  No, no, no.  You want Rod Stewart?  No.  Anything but Rod Stewart.  Any Barry Manilow?  It was a Barry Manilow.  Yeah, right.  I live with Barry Manilow.  No way. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, yes.  So way.  Okay.  Um.  And this is what happened to him.  I can't go there right now.  Oh, come on.  Belt one out.  Yeah, belt one out for all the time.  I'm trying to belt one out right now.  Okay, I'm going to belt something tough.  Hey!  If you want my body...  I know it.  ...and you think I'm sexy...  I know it.  Come on, baby, let me know. 
[01:28:30]  If you really want me.  Oh, I'm ready.  Come on, baby, let me know.  Who sang that?  Rod Stewart.  Yep, you got it.  He's just looking around.  He'd turn around to high-five and imagine a person.  I can't do it like Rod Stewart, but...  What about Barry Manilow now?  You lived with Barry Manilow?  Briefly.  Briefly?  What do you mean by that?  This one's for you wherever you are. 
[01:29:00]  What do you mean briefly there, Tippy?  What happened?  Let us know about the relationship there.  Well, the relationship was this.  I met at a bar and I don't know...  The Copacabana?  No!  Downtown in the village.  Copacabana.  There he is.  The hottest spot north of Copacabana.  Tippy's dancing.  He has the Copacabana.  Copacabana.  Yeah. 
[01:29:30]  Tippy's showing off his dance moves.  Fashion at the Copacabana.  His name was Tippy.  He smelled like dogs.  All right, Tippy, so what?  You met Barry Manilow at a bar?  Yeah.  All right.  And then what happened?  Yeah, it was a bar down in the village.  All right.  Okay, one of them bars.  And I don't know if flaggy places.  Oh, really?  One of the... 
[01:30:00]  I think at this point of the story, we should tell everybody.  We have no idea if this is...  Well, I'm a little...  Are you actually trying to say that maybe Barry Manilow isn't...  Imagine this...  A little light in the loafers, as they say.  Imagine this is Barry Manilow's worst nightmare.  Yeah.  The guy he's talking about...  The guy will kill me.  Yeah.  All right?  All right, so it was in one of these bars, and you made your hand go like this, like...  Like a...  Like...  What do you mean by one of these bars? 
[01:30:30]  Swish.  A little swishy?  Yeah.  A little...  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  A little fruity?  Who's fruity?  Are you saying that Barry Manilow might have been a little fruity?  Well, I'm not sure.  Okay.  I...  I...  I...  Allegedly...  I was hoping he would be a little fruity.  Oh.  Because I'm a little fruity myself.  Yeah.  For the new listeners, Timmy Tom is...  A little fruity.  A gay gentleman. 
[01:31:00]  But I think he's actually bisexual, because we've set him up with some women over the years,  and he had no problem with that.  Wait a minute.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Okay.  Whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Let's list something up right now.  All right.  All right.  I've been in Greenwich Village for almost 15 years.  Me telling me I ain't going to become a fruit?  What kind of goddamn pineapple do you think I am?  Don't let me say a bad word.  Right, right.  Lord, wait a second. 
[01:31:30]  So you saw him at a bar, and then what happened?  Barry Manilow.  This guy knows how to follow the rules better than Louis C.K.  Okay, all right.  It's going to be said.  He's editing himself.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Yeah.  We went back to his apartment on Horatio Street.  Uh-huh.  Ooh.  And a dog named Bagel, little big old hound, and I met the dog.  I'm staying there.  And so I spent a couple of days there. 
[01:32:00]  You spent a couple of days at Barry Manilow's house?  Yeah, downtown, yeah.  Was there any romance?  Well, of course.  You know, what do you mean?  Wait, they have a whole gap for nothing?  Of course not.  Now, this is when you were, you know, golden buns, I guess.  Back when I was golden buns.  Well, I still got my buns, but the thing is, you know, they're sagging a little bit. 
[01:32:30]  But I'm still golden buns.  I got the nicest ass in this whole studio.  And I'll tell you right now, I see everybody, no ass.  Jimmy's got a nice ass.  No ass.  I see no ass here.  Well, why don't we line up the boys, and you can decide if any of them have nice ass.  You see who has nice ass. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, pull your pass down.  Come on, Eros.  Let's go.  Come on.  Eros, let's go.  Pat Duffy, let's go.  All right.  Club Soda Kenny, let's go.  I need some booty.  All right, let's line up the guys in front of Tippi Tom.  Tippi, you decide who has a nice ass.  Danny, let's go.  Somebody.  Here comes Jimmy.  All right, Jimmy, we'll start.  Tippi's going to pick the best.  Yeah, everybody line up.  Everyone's got to line up.  All right, line up.  Hang a moon.  Hang a moon for Tippi Tom.  Hold on a minute.  And then Tom.  Hold on, let me set this up.  And then we need Tom to critique the asses.  We're filming this. 
[01:33:30]  We got Jim Norton.  We got Club Soda Kenny.  We got Danny.  We got.  Why is the girl.  Girl, you don't have.  No, Travis, get in there.  Pat Duffy.  And E-Rock.  Jimmy, move over a little bit so we get everybody.  I'll make a judgment.  I'll shoot up the nicest ass.  Should we do it one at a time or all?  All right.  Yeah, he should critique.  Move down a little bit so we can get E-Rock in front of Tippi Tom.  Yeah, one at a time.  He should critique each ass.  Yeah, all right.  Who wants to start?  E-Rock, go.  All right, E-Rock.  Now, Tippi Tom, what do you think? 
[01:34:00]  Go ahead.  All right, E-Rock, go ahead.  Whoa, whoa.  Whoa, that's some booty right there.  E-Rock's got some booty right there.  Number one.  You like that, Tippi Tom?  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, okay.  Is there anything wrong with his butt?  Nothing wrong with it at all.  Oh, look at that, E-Rock.  Wow, E-Rock.  Hey, E-Rock.  All right.  No, no.  I'll see more ass.  All right.  All right. 
[01:34:30]  Here's Pat Duffy.  Oh, my God.  We got another one.  Oh, my goodness.  It's going to be a tough job for me.  Damn, that booty.  Oh, my God.  What do you like about that one?  Hold me back.  Oh, my God.  Oh, what a nightmare.  What do you like about Pat Duffy's ass?  It's a nice ass.  It's speechless.  All right.  Speechless.  Look, he's so good.  There's nothing wrong with that ass at all. 
[01:35:00]  No, huh?  Pat, congratulations.  You made Tippi Tom see God.  I feel really good about it.  Damn.  That's good.  All right, Travis.  All right, Travis.  Now, here's a different type of ass.  Oh, he's really bummed that Pat Duffy pulled his pants back up.  All right.  This is more of a twink ass.  Oh, a twinkie?  Oh, my.  I want some of that.  Timmy Tom's coming up right behind Travis.  He wants some of that.  You like that?  Is that the best one so far? 
[01:35:30]  It's a good one right now.  Oh, no.  All right, here's the next one.  Here comes Danny.  Come on.  I want some more ass.  Oh, shit.  No.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Oh, my God, Danny.  I'm winning.  I am winning this one.  I think Danny's winning.  I'm winning this one.  These guys are very competitive, and I think.  All right, hold on.  Let me tell you what happened.  Yeah.  Danny showed Tippi Tom's butt hair.  I'm golden buns, and I'll tell you right now. 
[01:36:00]  If you're golden buns, I'm platinum buns.  Mine are better.  Wait.  Let Tippi Tom finish.  What were you going to say?  I was going to say you got a nice ass.  Danny worked it a little bit.  He, like, twitched his hip a little bit.  He kicked it out a little bit.  Look.  I know what I got to do to win.  These guys are very competitive.  Come on.  These guys are very competitive.  Let me see your ass.  Oh.  All right, so.  Oh, that's a real ass. 
[01:36:30]  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Tippi cannot stay away from a man ass.  Did we explain when Danny pulled his pants down that Tippi started cursing?  He loved it so much.  Oh, yeah.  He said to Kenny, that's a real ass.  Boy, he's got you pegged.  And last but not least, of course, is Jim Norton, who.  Yeah.  Tom.  Tom.  Tippi.  What do you think of a Jimmy's?  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Oh, she's so stay away.  Tippi, get on mic.  Get on mic. 
[01:37:00]  We got to hear you.  Tom.  No, that's real ass.  That's the best ass I've.  You win.  Wow.  Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy Norton edges out Danny for the best ass.  You know what?  According to Tippi Tom.  Hold on a minute.  No.  I think Jimmy broke the rules, though.  Jimmy did a few things that we can't explain here to make sure he won the competition.  Oh, Jimmy.  Jimmy went.  He pulled his pants down completely, first of all.  And then, I believe, did you also do something so that maybe more was seen? 
[01:37:30]  What do you mean?  I don't know.  Kind of use your hands a little bit.  So a little more.  Oh, no, no, no.  I actually didn't.  Oh, you didn't?  Hold on.  But what he did do, it looked like he dropped something on the floor.  Oh, okay.  Yes.  All right.  That's what you did.  Hold on.  Does anyone, can I ask you a question?  Sure, sweetie.  Have you been massaging your buns?  No, they're very.  I think you've been. 
[01:38:00]  You got implants?  He's asking if they're real.  No, what I did was I dropped a trowel.  Oh, that's real?  Yeah.  And I sexually scuttled forward.  Yes, you did.  Yes, a little scuttle forward.  Scuttle with your undies around here.  Are the guys going to let Jimmy take the title?  Does anyone else want a second shot at this?  I think.  What about Stan?  Stan thought he got out of it with his microphone holding. 
[01:38:30]  Good job.  What about Steve?  Where's Steve at?  How about you guys?  Get out of here.  I did tongue scraping.  I think I'm going to pass on this one.  You can show him your cheeks.  After yesterday?  Steve, are you going to show?  My ass smells worse than my leg.  All right, we got Steve.  We're mooning Tippi.  All right, Tippi, here's another one.  All right, Tippi. 
[01:39:00]  All right.  Here's another one.  What do you think?  All right.  My God.  Let me get a load of this.  No.  Get away from Steve.  No, he said, let me get a load of this.  Right.  Yeah, I'm saying.  You see how slow Steve got away?  I don't know.  Oh, please stay away.  Oh, please.  Oh, no, help me.  Steve's a little shy.  And so he's a little shy about this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Well, I'm golden bones.  And I'll tell you what.  Oh, Roland. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, Roland.  Roland will do it.  Come on, Roland.  Tippi, Tippi, do you like a hairier gentleman or a gentleman with not much hair?  I like both.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Roland is stepping up.  Let me see.  Here we go.  Here's our.  Ow!  Oh, Jesus.  No, no, get back.  Roland just ran away.  He just mooned and ran.  What did you think of that one there, Tippi Tom?  He gave me.  He gave me the moon?  Yeah.  Well, moon me some more. 
[01:40:00]  I think he liked every single one.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  But Jimmy.  Oh, we got you.  Yeah, Jimmy won.  I have no problem with this.  And he got too close.  Jimmy won.  Jimmy won.  Fair and square.  I had the little tight.  I had an elliptical machining.  I'm an ass man.  What are you saying?  Yes, you are.  I'm an ass man.  There are people, actually, that think this is like a character that we just do on our show.  Nope.  No, he's the real deal. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, Tippi Tom.  All right.  We got to take a break, Tippi.  You like that?  You liked all those asses?  Yeah, I did.  Yeah.  It was very nice.  It was a good show.  But when can I get one?  All right.  We're going to do a little more with Tippi Tom when we get back.  Did he get the tongue?  Have you ever had your tongue scraped there, Tippi Tom?  My what?  Your tongue scraped.  My tongue?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, my tongue straight? 
[01:41:00]  No, no.  Scraped.  You take a little scraper and you scrape to see what's on there.  Well, no, I never had that.  Well, we're going to figure out what we're going to do with you next.  Actually, we're going to do some news with you, Tippi Tom.  It's going to look like the floor at the Peep Show.  Yeah.  Are you playing music now?  Yeah, or that.  Come on, Tippi Tom.  I'm unhappy with all this nice ass, and I can't get one. 
[01:41:30]  Which one would you like?  I want them all.  Well, if you could pick one, which one would you pick?  I'm going to pick right there.  Ooh.  Me?  Oh, wow.  Travis.  Feed Travis to Tippi Tom.  Wait, wait, wait.  Steve, grab the little twink and give him the Tippi Tom as a present for coming in today.  How did Sam and Sam get away with not showing their little delicious buns?  I'm going to interrupt.  I don't mean to be done. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, Sam.  Sam's going to have to.  I want his ass.  What do you think?  You want closer to Kenny?  All right.  I want his ass.  Tippi.  I know his ass is good.  Tippi.  We got one more.  Tippi, hold on.  You got one more.  Oh, my God.  What do you think of this?  This is young Sam.  Oh, my God.  No, no, no.  You get back.  No, no, get back.  You can't have it.  Wait a minute.  That is good product.  I swear to God.  How much you want? 
[01:42:30]  Good product.  Well, I'm product.  Right.  Yeah.  Stupid, right?  What am I saying?  Oh, God.  How much you want for it?  But I'm a stud.  Well, Tippi Tom picked the right guy.  Considering young Sam's ancestry, we could probably sell you off here today, Sam.  Oh, jeez.  What?  That's because he had an African booty.  He wins.  Who wins? 
[01:43:00]  Sam?  My God.  He likes young Sam.  Him or the other guy that's hiding?  Well, there's so many of them.  I can't choose.  All right.  Tippi, when we get back.  I want to try them all out.  He wants to test drive them.  Tippi, when we get back, we're going to do current events with you, all right?  Oh, current events?  Yeah, you're good at that.  Of course.  All right.  Of course.  Why wouldn't he be? 
[01:43:30]  Leaves his head on a newspaper every night.  Yeah.  You'd imagine he'd read a few lines.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Anybody got a beer?  Yeah, we got one.  I'm an ass man.  Yeah, I'm an ass man.  Yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen, entering the studio, once again, Tippi Tom.  I'm sure glad he's taking advantage of one of our fine sponsors. 
[01:44:00]  All right.  Anybody have a question for me?  Yes.  Put your headphones on.  I want to hear a real question.  You want a real question?  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Do you have a son?  Yes, I do.  Oh.  And where is he?  And how old is he?  And what does he do?  And when was the last time you saw him?  His name is Charlie, and he is, when I was married, but that was years ago, he's about almost 20. 
[01:44:30]  And so I haven't seen him.  He's off by seven years.  Quite a while ago.  But the problem is that the reason why I got separated from my wife is because I have other interests.  You have other interests?  Yeah.  I think we saw your other interests about 20 minutes ago. 
[01:45:00]  Do you miss your son?  Tom, you miss your son?  Oh, of course I do.  But, you know, I don't want him to know that his father is a little flaky, a little on the gay side.  And so, yes, but I married a woman.  I know that's serious here, but that's what happened.  And so, but no, I married a woman. 
[01:45:30]  Why'd you get married if you were a little flaky, as you say?  Yeah.  Well, because I wanted to be with a woman.  I wanted to have a baby.  And I did.  And Charlie, now, is about 15 years old.  And he might be flaky, too.  Tommy and Charlie.  But he's very handsome.  Did he say Tommy?  No, he said Charlie.  No, his name is Charlie.  Oh.  My name is Tommy.  Right.  Right.  And that's the story of my world.  My wife left me. 
[01:46:00]  Now, you, I hear tell, were a successful businessman at one point in your life.  Well, I had a window washing business.  Yes.  I had a window cleaning service and a floor cleaning and waxing and all that stuff.  And it worked out really well.  Now, what happened that took you from there, a successful businessman, your own business,  a wife, a kid, to where you are now, a man of the streets?  Well, I wanted to come back home, and I had a problem with slot machines and poker tables. 
[01:46:30]  Uh-oh.  So this could be my future that I'm looking at right now.  What do you mean, could be?  Well, hey.  Look, you're a mere year behind.  Hey, I make money playing poker.  Yeah, what kind of poker?  Well, a five-card stud, seven-card stud.  What do you want?  What kind of?  All right, blackjack.  How do you want to go?  How about a little Texas hold'em? 
[01:47:00]  I've never played that.  All right, so you had a problem with gambling, playing poker in the slot.  Yeah, I have a problem.  Lost a lot of your money.  I have a problem with gambling.  And then you try to go home?  Well, no, I made more than I lost, actually.  Oh, really?  But, you know, I would blow it.  Where's your money now?  Well, I didn't make that much money.  What would you blow it on? 
[01:47:30]  Like, what, were you into drugs at any point?  Well, I had my share of cocaine.  Yeah.  And I, yes, I had my share of marijuana.  Had my share of alcohol.  The most potent drug we got that's cheap.  Come on.  It's okay to say that, right?  Alcohol?  Of course.  All right, yeah.  So, alcohol industry is the biggest industry in this country.  To sell the most powerful drug we got. 
[01:48:00]  You know that?  I do now.  You're teaching us.  You know vodka?  You know...  You tell me anything about alcohol.  Yeah.  You tell me those guys ain't got it down?  That's a legal drug.  It's a legal drug.  That's just what I say.  You damn right.  You're absolutely tippy.  Why is it legal?  Because it's taxed, and the government makes money off of it. 
[01:48:30]  So, what's wrong with...  Why can't we tax cocaine?  Well, why don't we start with trying to tax, like, pot?  Yeah, tax pot.  Let's go with that argument.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cocaine's a bit of a jump from alcohol.  Pot, not so much.  Well, they tried to make alcohol illegal once.  Pot's fun.  Didn't work.  Pot's fun.  They tried prohibition.  That didn't work.  It just made organized crime huge. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, organized crime had nothing to do with alcohol?  Yeah, it did.  You damn right, it did.  I love this debate.  I watch the History Channel.  Where do you watch the History Channel?  Well, when I get a TV, I do.  When do you get a TV?  When I was in somebody's house.  When he's sleeping outside a TV store.  Best Buy.  Way to improv a good one.  TV store.  A TV store.  Kitted.  Well, yeah.  Well, I watch TV. 
[01:49:30]  But the thing is this.  It doesn't matter.  I watch PBS.  I'll give a plug.  I'm sure they love that.  They let me know what's going on in the world.  All right, listen, Anthony.  I'm getting word that we're...  Hold on.  I'm talking to Anthony who's over here.  And I'm getting word that this is an imposter.  And we got the real Tippi Tom over here. 
[01:50:00]  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, Tippi.  I'm the real Tippi Tom.  Where the other Tippi Tom at?  Yeah, Tippi Tom is an imposter.  I'm the real...  I'm the original Golden Bunch.  What's up, Tippi?  How are you guys doing?  We're doing good.  I need a beer.  Somebody get me a beer.  We got an imposter in the studio that's claiming to be you, sir.  No.  No, it's not right.  No.  I'm the real Tippi Tom.  I'm the original Golden Bunch. 
[01:50:30]  And anyone else is faking it.  Listen.  If you want my body.  And you think I'm sexy.  Who are you, sir?  You're not the real Tippi Tom, obviously.  You got to forgive me.  Yeah.  I want to be the real Tippi Tom.  But obviously, the real one somewhere is in the building.  You're an imposter.  Well, I'm posing as the Tippi Tom. 
[01:51:00]  I used to live with Barry Madelow.  I used to bet his dog, you're trying to be Tippi Tom, and you're not him.  I'm the real Tippi Tom.  All right.  If you're the real Tippi Tom, what kind of dog did Barry Madelow have?  It was, he had a little beagle.  Yeah.  See?  And his name was Bagel, because I was there hiding off. 
[01:51:30]  Bagel.  Yeah, right.  Emery's like a goldfish.  And I know that, because I'm the original Tippi Tom.  I know.  I've been living in Grinchville for 15 years.  I know.  I met Barry Madelow with a little bars, a little flaky.  Uh-oh.  Do you have anything to say to that, sir?  Well, I guess there's an imposter acting as Tippi Tom.  Yeah.  Who is not the real Tippi Tom. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, that's you.  Well, I am the real Tippi Tom.  No, you're not.  You're an imposter.  I'm the original Tippi Tom.  There's only one way to prove it.  There's only one Golden Buns.  I think we do.  I'm the original Golden Buns.  Golden Buns.  Do you have the Golden Buns, or does he have the Golden Buns?  Well, I don't know.  I've got to look at his buns first.  Look at my Golden Buns.  I have the original Golden Buns.  Oh, my God.  He might have.  I think he is. 
[01:52:30]  It's possible.  It's highly likely he might be the real Tippi Tom.  Hey, Tippi.  Tippi, he's got the Golden Buns, but the thing is this.  Yeah.  I got Golden Buns, too.  Yeah, let's see your Golden Buns.  Let's see my Golden Buns.  Yeah, let's see your Golden Buns.  Let's go.  Let's see it.  I'm back here, baby.  Let's see your Golden Buns there, Tippi.  No, no.  Stay there.  Stay there.  You got to stay there. 
[01:53:00]  He's just turning around.  Stay by the mic.  He's just turning around.  No, stay by the...  Oh, God.  He's hitting his Golden Buns.  What, Tippi?  He's just pointing at the Golden Buns.  What are you pointing at?  The rash?  Oh, God.  This stuff.  The real Golden Buns.  Oh, my God.  There was stuff there, right?  There was a remainder.  Oh, God.  He's gagging. 
[01:53:30]  He's what?  Well, it was...  I don't know what's going on, Jimmy.  Help me out.  Apparently, Tom on the subway sat in a Hershey's kiss.  There's not a lot of hygiene going on there.  Let's get the stats.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Oh, my God.  He's gagging.  E-Rock, you've never disappointed us.  Could you just get on your knees?  You can do it.  Yeah, get on your knees.  I need a blowjob. 
[01:54:00]  Wait a minute.  It did be, Tom.  Oh, my God.  Line of the day that had to be dumped out.  Oh, my God.  I didn't mean that.  I apologize.  All right.  You should apologize.  That's all right.  You still have less dumps than we see.  I still want a blowjob.  No.  Hey, Tom.  No, Tom.  Tom.  You can't say that.  Yeah.  All right, Tom.  You've got to calm down.  Oh, my God.  Tom, now you've got to...  All right.  I'm calming down. 
[01:54:30]  All right, Keith, you've got to make sure...  Okay, but all right.  I'll calm down.  But can you rub my balls?  Hold on.  Hold on.  You're a maniac.  Keith, you've got to...  It's funny, but you've got to, like...  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  You've got to...  Just hit me.  What am I...  What am I...  What am I doing wrong?  Tom, you've got to take your jacket off.  You've got to watch the line.  Yeah, Tom.  No more.  No more.  Okay, watch the line.  Yeah, no more.  No more.  All right?  You've got some great lines out there. 
[01:55:00]  I apologize.  I didn't mean to be nasty.  Yeah.  Pass him on my balls.  No.  No.  You can't.  Tom.  Hold on.  We're going to run out of dump.  Oh, my God.  He's out of control.  Listen, at this point, we just need to count to ten.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we've got to really let these things build up.  All right, all right.  I'm calming down.  All right, Tom's calming back down.  He's got to show his buns.  We're dumping like crazy at this point. 
[01:55:30]  All right, Timmy, Tom, calming down.  Please.  I apologize for all my bad language.  All right, Tom, please, because we've done some...  It's not bad, but it's not...  All right, we've done some nice things for you today, so please, work with us.  Yes, you have.  Work with us.  E-Rock, get up.  You've never disappointed us.  You have been nice things for me.  You're always nice.  Timmy, Tom.  All right, Tom, you've got to listen to Jimmy for a second.  We need you...  Could you show your buns again?  Because he wants to just look at your buns close.  He's not going to...  Oh!  Yeah.  E-Rock, wait.  Who's going to look at the buns?  Take your jacket off. 
[01:56:00]  Let's get...  Yeah, take your jacket off.  Your nice new jacket that Keith got you.  Or actually, Keith got you another jacket, and you traded up for that one, it looks like.  That's nice.  Very nice.  Look at that.  Yeah, is that a peacoat?  Oh, my God.  If it's not, we'll...  I'll lob one in for you, Jimmy.  Sure, I did.  He's got a long...  He loves me.  He's got a long peacoat.  He's got a hoodie on.  It's going to be 70 degrees in New York today.  What happened?  What happened?  He just finished his sentence and kept it off with a nice belcher.  Oh, really? 
[01:56:30]  All right.  Can you guys set this up nice?  E-Rock, get on your knees in front of...  Behind him.  Behind him.  Yeah.  Tom, turn around.  Turn around and show your...  Wait, wait.  First...  First, get E-Rock on his knees.  Can we?  Let's do this right.  Keep him behind the mic a little bit, or...  Keith, you've got to protect E-Rock.  Well, no.  You could turn him this way...  Just turn around.  ...so he could see, but...  All right.  E-Rock, get on your knees.  Oh, God damn it.  E-Rock, get on your knees.  Oh, God.  Get on the knees?  No, no.  E-Rock.  Hold on.  Just go this way?  All right.  Hold on. 
[01:57:00]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let's do this right.  E-Rock, get on your knees, please.  When?  When?  E-Rock, get on your knees in front of him.  In front of him.  Come on, E-Rock.  You've never disappointed before.  Hold on, Tom.  We'll let you know.  I threw my buns off.  E-Rock, you've got to get in front a little more.  A little more.  A little more, E-Rock.  E-Rock, come on.  You know that damn what I do.  Tom, you're too far away, E-Rock.  What are you doing?  Yeah, E-Rock, come on.  E-Rock's got to get closer.  Get closer.  E-Rock, just shimmy up there.  Get a little closer.  E-Rock, just get a little closer. 
[01:57:30]  You know what golden buns is?  E-Rock, get a little closer.  Yeah, I know.  Oh.  Golden buns is...  Come on.  E-Rock, you're killing me here.  How am I going to shut my ass off?  You're showing off.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  E-Rock, get closer.  All right.  Turn around toward E-Rock, Tom, and show those golden buns.  Get closer.  E-Rock, get closer.  E-Rock, get closer.  E-Rock, get closer.  All right, get closer.  E-Rock, get closer.  Now, now, take a good way.  Look. 
[01:58:00]  He's damn...  Oh, God.  Look at all that.  Oh, my God.  What's in there?  E-Rock, we still don't know what's in there, E-Rock.  Get over there.  E-Rock, get in there.  E-Rock, all fours, his face is beet red.  Take a look, E-Rock.  E-Rock, Tom, turn around.  Turn around.  No, no, no, no.  E-Rock, E-Rock, take a look.  E-Rock, take a look.  No, no, no.  Turn around.  E-Rock, come on.  E-Rock, get in there.  Get in there.  Tell us what that is.  Oh, that's awful.  Well, tell us what it is. 
[01:58:30]  No way.  No way.  I think I puked in my eyes. 
[01:59:00]  He thinks he puked in his eyes.  All right, all right.  I'm laughing so hard, it hurts.  I feel sorry for the guy over here.  Oh, it hurts.  Yeah, I know.  E-Rock, what happened, E-Rock?  Well, he tried to outdo me, and he got sick.  Maybe he looked at my ass and he got sick.  I don't know.  Well, maybe, yeah.  E-Rock, what happened?  I'm sorry.  What's the smell like?  Oh, God, the smell was worse when he took his pants off, but the look of it looks like 
[01:59:30]  he's added fertilizer.  Well, nobody's perfect.  That's true.  Nobody's perfect.  Come on.  Yeah.  I'm going to cut the guy some slack.  E-Rock never disappoints.  I beat him up, but, man, the guy comes to the table.  Oh, my God.  E-Rock's in the bathroom. 
[02:00:00]  Because he's eating.  The funny thing is, like, E-Rock was on all fours, and he was trying to get as close as  he could to, you know, Tibby Tom, and he just couldn't do it.  He kept backing back up.  Oh, my God.  Wait, he can't compete with Tibby Tom.  Yeah.  Because I got the...  I'm golden buns number one.  Golden buns, all right.  All right, listen, we're going to take a quick break.  We're going to do current events with Tibby Tom to wrap up the show today.  Stay there.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hit it. 
[02:00:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Let's not forget, Jim Norton is flying out today.  He's going to be in the Detroit area.  He's got two shows, I believe.  Right, Jimmy?  Yeah.  One is in a college.  It's in Central Michigan University tomorrow.  But Saturday, April 12th, Pontiac, Michigan, Clutch Cargo.  It's on Huron Street.  You can go to Ticketmaster.  It's a 7.30 p.m. show.  I'm only doing one show in the Detroit area.  7.30 p.m. show.  Very nice.  We've got Tibby Tom in studio.  He's been entertaining the hell out of us for the last hour. 
[02:01:00]  Hey, Tibby, we're going to do a speed round with you because we've got to get out of here,  okay?  You've got to do what?  I knew that was coming.  We're going to ask you about current events.  How's that?  Oh, what happened currently?  Yeah.  I went to the bathroom.  That's what happened currently.  What more do you want to know?  Well, I want to know about the election.  Who are you voting for?  Obama or Hillary or John McCain? 
[02:01:30]  First of all, I do not like Hillary.  Why don't you like Hillary?  Why don't you like her?  She's a Democrat.  I'm a Republican.  Okay?  Oh, in your lifestyle, you're a Republican.  Well, I was raised that way.  Okay.  I mean, I have no problem with Bill Clinton, but Bill Clinton and Hillary did a good job  and she's going to be elected.  I know that.  Oh, yeah?  Yes. 
[02:02:00]  I really believe this.  Why do you think she's going to be elected even though you don't like her?  Because they want a woman in office.  What about Obama?  Who?  Obama?  Barack Obama?  I have to look into it more.  Wow.  Look, I don't read up all the papers every day like you guys do.  Well, Barack Obama is the black candidate.  You must have seen his face by now.  Oh, well, maybe I'll vote for him. 
[02:02:30]  I don't know.  I probably have, but I've been kept up with everything lately.  But, you know, I just, I'm not that smart.  All right.  So, and you're a Republican.  So, are you going to vote for John McCain?  John McCain?  Yeah.  Old-fashioned.  We don't need him no more.  You know, what the hell we need him for?  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was a Vietnam vet, though.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, that was my father. 
[02:03:00]  Think I give a shit?  Hippie.  Hippie.  Got to watch those words.  Why'd you curse?  Do you like your father?  No, he thumped me on my head.  He threw you on your head?  No, he hit me with a knuckle.  He thumped me, he thumped him on his head.  Why did he hit you with a knuckle to your head?  He kicked me in my ass.  Why did he kick your ass?  You want to dad like that?  Why did he kick your ass?  I don't know.  When was this? 
[02:03:30]  I probably didn't want to know a little kid.  Yeah.  Aw, poor little Tippie got beat up.  Did he catch a plane in Monster Rain?  But I still love him.  And you loved your mom, too, right?  Of course.  Yes.  Oh!  Jesus.  I probably deserved everything I got anyway.  All right, cool.  Hey, a lot of people talking about 9-11.  They're thinking it was an inside...  9-11!  That was a military operation or something.  What do you mean, military operation? 
[02:04:00]  9-11 was when they bombed something?  The Twin Towers, remember when they came down?  Oh, yes, I do.  I was here.  Where were you?  I was uptown.  And I saw the planes fly into the buildings.  And thank God I was far enough away.  They crashed into the buildings.  You're kidding.  When did this happen?  You're damn right. 
[02:04:30]  A few years back.  And I was watching.  I said, what the hell is this?  And I saw the smoke.  I said, holy shit.  Thank God.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Time, time, time, time.  You said holy ass, right?  You said holy ass, Tom?  What's that again?  You said holy crap.  Yeah, holy crap.  So who do you think did that?  Who do you think ran the planes into the buildings? 
[02:05:00]  I don't know.  What's your guess?  Somebody that don't like America.  There you go.  Bravo.  Perceptive.  Bravo, Tom.  Bravo.  What else do we want?  I love America.  It's my country.  It's where I was born.  And I'm not leaving.  And this is where I was raised.  And I don't know who did that.  And whoever did it was wrong. 
[02:05:30]  Wow.  Going out on a limb.  Yeah, absolutely.  What else?  Yeah, right.  I ain't scared of them suckers.  Whoever did that shit.  Do that.  Right.  And I don't mean to laugh, but you're cursing a lot.  Well, I curse.  Yeah.  Yeah, you do.  Oh, okay.  Hey, you want to ask him anything else there, Jimmy?  What else would you want to ask Tibby Tom, current event-wise?  How do you feel about the Iraq War, what's happening over there?  Do you think we should pull out or stay the course? 
[02:06:00]  The Iraq War?  Right.  Okay, who's in charge of the Iraqi army now?  Good question, Tom.  The military.  Uh-huh.  I don't know.  No, I haven't come up with their fight.  I worry about fights go here.  I ain't worried about what fight go on somewhere.  Is that?  You worry about, okay, who's fighting in Russia right now?  Um, Chechnians.  No, no, no, no, no, no. 
[02:06:30]  Who's fighting in Russia right now?  Uh, Russians.  No, no, no.  Who's fighting Russia?  Who's fighting them?  Oh.  Uh, the Canadians.  The Canadians?  Yep.  From Canada?  Yeah.  No, the other Canadians.  They're coming down.  Yeah.  The Canucks?  Yeah.  Are coming down?  Yeah, they're going through Alaska.  Okay.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  You asked me a question that I don't even really understand.  All right, you don't know that one. 
[02:07:00]  How about, uh, what was the last movie you saw?  See any good movies lately?  Uh, lately, I don't know.  What was the last movie you saw?  Mother Jugs and Speed.  Say it again.  I know, it's quite all right.  Yeah, what was the last movie you saw, Tom?  I saw, um, let's see.  Let's see, let's see.  Let me get this in my head.  I've taken up time, I know that. 
[02:07:30]  It's all right.  Um, uh, the movie.  Oh, ask me what movie I like the most.  Uh, Tippy, what's the movie you like the most?  Okay, I'll give you the actress's, the actress's name, and it broke my heart.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  He's rubbing his chest.  Meryl Streep.  Meryl Streep. 
[02:08:00]  What's she playing?  Uh, a lot of movies, Tom.  You gotta give us a little more.  Uh, Iron Weed.  Kramer.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Meryl Streep.  Kramer versus Kramer.  Oh, no, that was another one.  All right, what, which one?  Uh, uh, it was the one with the daughter.  What was...  Oh, no, no, the one where she was in the Nazi, German camp, the Nazis had her, the German. 
[02:08:30]  I'm German, and I'm embarrassed about how Germans do this stuff.  And shame on me.  But I didn't do it.  But I'd be embarrassed about being German.  Meryl Streep, yeah, well, my name is Schultz.  And so...  Schultz!  Beaches?  Beaches is the movie?  No!  With Meryl Streep.  She was in the Nazi concentration camp.  Oh, I know it.  And, um, it was, um, oh, my God, help me. 
[02:09:00]  The Deer Hunter.  Oh, that was another one!  What movie is he talking about?  I'm gonna work on...  Meryl Streep, come on, you know who she is?  Sophie's Choice.  Sophie's Choice!  You know what the movie was about?  What was it about?  She had two children.  Two children.  And the Nazis took her, and they said, you can't go with both of them. 
[02:09:30]  You know who she gave up?  Oh.  Her girl.  The daughter.  They keep the boy.  That was Sophie's Choice.  How'd you have to be a mom and have to do that?  Why do you all give up?  And Nazi Germany, that's how they were. 
[02:10:00]  You only have one kid.  How emotional he's getting.  Terrible, terrible thing.  What happened to the other kid?  I don't know!  But what I know is that Sophie Meryl Streep gave up her daughter.  To save her son.  Was she Jewish?  Is that it? 
[02:10:30]  So, I don't know.  She's Jewish or not.  She's German.  And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, but that's what happened.  So you don't like the Nazis, right?  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, really?  I love the Nazis.  They're great.  He's killing you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I really like them guys.  Yeah, right.  I can't wait to hang out with them. 
[02:11:00]  Get the fuck out of here.  Oh, Jesus.  Tom, watch the, uh, watch the words.  Now, Tom, she had to give up her kid, which is a big, but didn't you, in a way, do the  same thing, not for the Nazis, but didn't you do the same thing when you kind of came  to New York and you're drinking and you kind of gave up your kid?  Tippy's choice.  Yeah, Tippy's choice.  Tippy's choice.  You gave up your kid because you didn't want him to know that you were a little flaky, right?  Yeah.  Tom, you told us earlier.  You had to give up a kid.  Yeah.  Yeah, but I made sure my kid was with his mother. 
[02:11:30]  Don't you wonder how he's doing in school or what, what is, like, sports he plays?  Hey, grandmother.  I did the best I could.  We were going to do a divorce.  What do you do?  You go through a divorce, you come talk to me when you go through a divorce, and we'll  discuss what's going on.  But don't you call him?  What are you going to do?  Give him a call.  So I give a kid, the mother, and I pay child support. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, you did?  Of course.  What, you think I'm not?  I was just asking, Tippy.  Right, he just...  I was just asking, you did?  I have money.  I don't need nobody's money.  You do?  I come out here and just play.  I got my own.  You don't know who I know.  Oh, really?  So you got your own deal set up where you make money and stuff? 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  You ever hear of a guy named John Lehman?  Ooh, the John Lehman?  No.  I didn't know him.  Herbert Lehman?  Who's he?  I don't know.  You just mentioned your names.  Herbert Lehman is John's father.  Uh-huh.  I don't know who these people are, and you can't really...  The fucking millionaires!  I'm already listening.  You don't know Lehman Brothers?  Of course you don't know Lehman Brothers. 
[02:13:00]  But you don't have to curse us out.  So you have some investments, I guess.  You're that right, I do.  Yeah.  Child support.  They open the envelope.  It's a hubcap and some grass.  Hey, Tom.  Sing us out of here.  We got to go.  That's it for us today.  Give us a little song as we leave everybody today.  Maybe something a little emotional.  We went a little emotional there for a few minutes.  All right.  Give us something a little emotional.  Let me hear a song.  No, just something in your head.  Something emotional.  Come on.  Feel it.  Something slow and nice and tugs at the heartstrings. 
[02:13:30]  All right.  Take us out.  I'm working on it right now.  Take us out.  Tippi Tom's going to sing us out with an emotional song.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Something emotional?  Yeah.  Something emotional to end the show.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Feel it.  Hold on.  There's so many of them.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Wishing you were here, my baby. 
[02:14:00]  Wishing you were here by me.  Yes, I know.  Yes, I know.  Wishing you were here.  Don't you know I love you so.  Don't you know I care.  Yes, I do.  Yes, I do.  Don't you know I care.  That's that old lyricist. 
[02:14:30]  That's it.  But I got all the wounds.  All right.  Thank you, Tom.  Thank you.  That was very touching.  That's a pretty song.  That was good.  Tippi Tom, everybody.  I know who sang it.  All right, we're out of here.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  See you over.  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's M202.  In the world of Radio Shock Shock, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice. 
[02:15:00]  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw.  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio host, Opie and Anthony.  Oh, it's brown. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, it's brown.  Smell, smell.  Oh, yeah!  This is where entertainment is going.  You've been stabbed once and shot twice.  No, I've been stabbed twice.  Shot twice.  Who's the common denominator with all these problems?  You have to lick a swath of the icing off so that bag shows through where icing was. 
[02:16:00]  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Here we are, XM Satellite Radio.  Trying to get the instant feedback working.  I don't know what's going on with that.  Hopefully a little...  Not too instant?  No, it's not too instant.  It's kind of frozen. 
[02:16:30]  The dump report was just terrific today on the other side.  Where's Tippi Tom?  We want him to actually read his own dump report because it's pretty much Tom's dumps that we're  going.  Do you have a mic set up for him?  I don't even...  Is he here?  Way over there.  Huh?  Oh, he's going to the bathroom.  Oh, God.  He's taking advantage of the facility.  He'll actually make that bathroom smell better.  Probably.  Goddamn monkey cage.  That is the worst.  Yeah.  Make sure there's a mic set up for him over there so he can sit like way over there because  I can't take that. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, boy.  Does that smell bad?  Where's the...  All right.  Whatever.  Isn't it amazing how bad the human body can smell if you don't, like, wash it?  If you just don't...  You just don't wash it.  And how bad it can get to smell.  It really is quite amazing how stinky we are as friggin' animals.  E-Rock was just amazing today.  Yep.  Fucking amazing.  He popped blood vessels. 
[02:17:30]  He puked so hard.  Yeah.  I heard him, like...  He did one wretch that was just like...  Where you just know his blood pressure shot up.  What do you got, Thane?  We...  Okay.  Well, we can start with this.  Are we getting this at all?  Okay, okay.  We can start with this.  All I'm saying about the Patriot Act is that the elected representatives of this country,  including Osama, uh, you know, not, not, uh, Obama.  Pardon me. 
[02:18:00]  I'm sorry.  I did not mean to...  I'm sorry about that.  I apologize publicly to you.  Uh, John Ashcroft.  Oh, is that Ashcroft?  What's the big deal?  He obviously wasn't trying to say Osama.  Uh, uh, Obama, I mean.  See, it's very easy to say.  And we're calling for his firing.  I'm sure somebody will.  Probably, but...  What's he doing these days?  He panicked.  He was, uh, talking at Skidmore University. 
[02:18:30]  That's what he's doing these days.  Skidmore.  Uh...  Yeah.  Uh, the thing is, though, they have been known on, on, like, Fox News to do that.  They always fuck the graphics up on the bottom.  They put Osama instead of Obama.  Of course.  All these guys say Osama.  I think it's a pretty, um, calculated move.  I know it's easily...  It's an easy mistake to make, but I think it's pretty calculated.  Yeah.  When they do it.  Wow.  Because you rarely see Democrats do it.  Oh. 
[02:19:00]  Tippy Tom's back.  Sitting in the couch.  Tommy.  Hopefully far enough away.  All right.  Wait a minute.  Now.  Hi, Tom.  Did you bring your reading glasses?  Tippy Tom back in town.  No, I know.  We already saw you.  Tippy Tom back in town.  Do you remember being on our show?  Remember?  Yes, I do remember.  You remember being on the show, like, just minutes ago.  Yeah.  What were you doing on our show today? 
[02:19:30]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  What did you say?  What did you do on our radio show today?  Well, I come over here and talk.  What did we talk about?  What did we do?  Whatever you want to talk about.  No, before.  Before.  What did you do before?  What'd you like to talk about?  Tom.  We'll talk about Nazi Germany.  Oh.  We'll talk about Adolf Hitler.  You want to talk about other things?  A little more light? 
[02:20:00]  What do you want to talk about?  No, I'm just asking, what did we do?  What did we talk about?  Oh, yeah, your ear thing.  Oh, he needs that.  He's deaf in one ear.  He needs headphones.  We already threw a pair out.  I don't know if we could afford throwing two pairs of headphones in one day.  Disposable headphones.  Huh?  What was the most recent thing that we talk about?  That's what they want to know.  Well, that's what I want to know.  Oh. 
[02:20:30]  You know what?  You remember the other place that we were just at?  Tom.  Listen to Than.  Than, just have him do it like Kenny.  You know, read the time.  What did we talk about today?  We need you to read the dump report, Tom.  Oh, Tom's dump report is $6.50, the sidewalk, $7.15, my pants.  $7.50, fucking.  No, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Start from the top.  Yeah, start from the top, Tom.  Stop it.  This is the dump report.  Stop it.  He's laughing at himself.  Right by Tippi Tom. 
[02:21:00]  Don't flatter me that much.  No, this is a flatterer.  My ego bigger than what it is.  All right, let's go, Tom.  The dump report with Tippi Tom.  Start right there.  Just start with here.  Don't read that.  Don't read the email address.  Read the number, and then what this says, and then who says it.  That's Anthony.  Okay, let's start with the number.  God, fuck yourself.  Oh, that's great, man.  Don't lose this news.  God, go fuck yourself. 
[02:21:30]  Dan, it's your job to have him do it the right way.  Yeah.  Okay, now say this number.  Shit.  Six, twenty-three.  And then this?  Scumbag.  Oh.  He's just laughing.  All right, continue.  All right, I'm in school right now.  Yep.  Say that there.  No, fuck Tippi Tom's over with. 
[02:22:00]  We got to go fuck Tippi Tom somewhere else.  Say that there.  Seven, fifty-four.  Shit.  Tippi Tom.  Tippi Tom.  You stop it.  You're flattering me.  Flattering?  How is that flattering?  This is stuff you said on the radio earlier.  All right, go ahead.  Do the next one, Tom.  There's just a list of that stuff. 
[02:22:30]  How about that?  You say the time?  Fucking ground, Tippi Tom.  Blow job, Tippi Tom.  What's the next one?  I said all them bad words?  Yeah, you did.  My mother would kill me.  Well, I don't think so.  Don't show me this.  Oh, boy.  No, well, he won't.  Don't show me, Tom.  Don't worry.  Unless it's taped to the top of a box. 
[02:23:00]  No, lick my balls.  Uh, Tom.  No, rub my balls.  He's still reading the dump report.  He's loving it.  Yeah.  Did I say this, Tom?  Did I say this, Tom?  Rub my balls.  What's the next one?  Okay.  I just want my balls.  Stop it.  Okay. 
[02:23:30]  Tippi Tom.  Boy, I do too much here.  Fuck Tippi Tom.  Shit, Tippi Tom.  Shit, Tippi Tom again.  Shit, Tippi Tom.  Fuck Tippi Tom.  Fucking Tippi Tom.  Well, why?  I can't get fucked?  I can't get laid here no more? 
[02:24:00]  We don't get you laid here, do we?  Well, we got him a hand job from...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, from Sandy Kane, right?  Yeah.  Hey, you know what we're doing?  We have the guys doing YouTube stuff, but there's no reason to do it on...  Yeah, I say bad words.  That's true.  There's no reason for them to be on YouTube if they could show certain clips from certain  films in here.  I don't mean to say the bad words, but I do.  Hey, Tippi Tom, we're trying to find you some clips from Sophie's Choice.  I do say bad words, and I don't mean to say that. 
[02:24:30]  See, he needs headphones, so we got to figure something out.  I already said a phone right now.  Oh, you are, all right, because he can't really hear us.  Suck my grandmother's dick.  How's that one?  Okay, that's good.  Yeah, go blow my grandmother.  My grandmother needs a pussy licked.  What's that?  Can you hear, Tom?  Can you hear us now?  Yeah.  What's going on?  What the...  Can we get horrific porn on all those TVs as we talk to them?  Can I say dirty words?  Yeah, you can say whatever you want.

All right, you see all the video screens in front of you?  Can we put them on all of them?  Oh.  Yeah, right.  You look up...  You got Star Wars?  Star Wars?  What are you talking about?  Who's that fucking colonel over there? 
[02:25:30]  That's CNN breaking news.  Is that colonel?  I'm sure a four-star...  What is it?  A four-star general likes being called a colonel.  Yeah.  Star Wars colonel from the Death Star.  Yeah.  First, it was Star Wars.  All right, Tippi Tom, we're going to show you a video.  All right.  What's going on?  Let's go.  Oh, my God.  What?  What do you see?  What are you looking at?  I feel like jerking off.  What are you seeing, though?  You got to explain.  What are you looking at?  It looks like a fucking going on.

[02:27:00]  Now we got to find it somewhere else.  Hold on a minute.  Why is it a pay site?  Fucking douchebags.  It's all over the internet.  Yeah, I know.  Who's a douchebag?  Not you.  Hold on, Tom.  We're setting up the video for you.  Tell me, Tom, I want to watch the video.  All right, we're going to show you a video here.  Hold on a minute.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Okay.

Yeah.  Yeah.  Piss on my face.  Yeah.  I want the whole nine yards.  There you go.  What do you think? 
[02:29:30]  That's two girls, one cup.  You like that?  That was pretty damn good.  Pretty damn good?  Hey, Tom, you want to do some gambling today?  Well, what kind of gambling?  We're thinking 21.  A little car playing?  A little blackjack?  A little blackjack?  You probably could use a few bucks.  I'm pretty goddamn good at blackjack.  Yeah?  Do you have a system?  No, I just know how to play.  Well, how do you know how to play?  Like, what do you mean by that?  I live in a Reno, Nevada for half my life.  Oh, that's where the gambling problem came from. 
[02:30:00]  I wasn't calling you stupid.  I was just trying to, you know, hear about your technique for winning money at blackjack.  What's your technique?  I know.  Jacket.  I have a special card, and, you know, I'll pull it out to make sure I win.  Really?  What's that special card?  Well, I make sure the deck is the same.  I get the same deck cards.  Yep.  And that way there.  When they deal me a hand, I'll put my cards in the hand, and that way there. 
[02:30:30]  Boom.  All right.  How are you going to beat me?  All right.  How many hands of blackjack do you want to play?  I don't know.  I'll play all night.  Anyone want to donate?  What is it?  Ten bucks a hand?  Well, it depends on what we're spending.  Well, we'll put up the money.  You got to beat...  I guess you got to beat Anthony.  I'll beat Anthony?  You got to beat... 
[02:31:00]  I'll be an Anthony, right.  You got to beat Anthony at blackjack.  I can't go over there.  Well, I don't know.  Yeah, he'll play.  Huh?  It's just going to be a long deal.  No, you can go over there and play.  No, I can't.  I don't think I can go over there.  Come on, it's not that bad.  Well, I don't...  Can I ask for a couple of hands?  I don't...  Can I get a word in here, please?  Sorry, Kyle.  All right.  We got a table.  We got a card table set up in front of...  I don't want to win that fast.  Huh?  I want to enjoy the game also.  And if I lose little, that's okay. 
[02:31:30]  But I want to make sure that I get all your loot  and that's why you're all broke  so you're kissing my ass and that's right there.  All right.  We're going to play blackjack.  Or what?  We got cards?  Yeah.  I have that cards with me now,  but I'll get some...  How are we going to do this?  Anthony, you just got us hit by the thing, right?  Yeah, I got to go over there somehow.  Somebody hook up a mic for Anthony.  There's a mic over there.  There's a table in between you and Tom.  That's easy.  It's too close. 
[02:32:00]  That's easy.  That's not so bad.  Tippi Tom, play cards.  Is there any...  Is there a headphone jack over there?  I like how he says things like that.  Tippi Tom, play cards.  He's very third-person oriented.  Yeah.  Right.  Hey, I want to shuffle them.  You want to use his headphones?  Uh, no.  And I don't want him shuffling either.  No, the dealer shuffles.  Oh, the dealer?  Yeah.  How do you know I trust that dealer?  He may have slipped me what I want. 
[02:32:30]  You got to take our word for it.  Oh, so I got to play that way.  Yeah.  Got to play that way.  Suppose I'll lose my money.  Well, then you'll lose your money.  That's gambling.  That's how you lost everything.  Then I'll be broke.  Oh, this guy know how to shuffle right now.  Oh, thank you, Yip, Sam. 
[02:33:00]  What's up?  Is there any other microphones over here?  What are we playing?  I'm going to get my loot.  Steve?  Oops.  How about we just fucking go home?  God damn this fucking place.  Why?  What's the matter?  What happened?  Why don't I have a mic?  No one's setting anything up.  No one's setting anything up.  My mic is odd.  Or is it?  I don't know.  Maybe.  There it is.  Listen to this fucking bullshit.  We're trying to do a bit. 
[02:33:30]  I just need to turn my headphones on.  I'm going to talk like tippy top.  Don't flatter me.  Okay.  No problem.  So, Tom, you sound like you really did have money.  Like you got an investment account or something?  Oh, no.  I know the Lehman Brothers Corporation.  And I work with John Lehman.  No, I know nothing about money. 
[02:34:00]  Do you know about the Lehman Brothers?  Well, I've heard of them.  They're stockbrokers.  All right?  All right, Tom.  They own Wall Street.  And, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Tell me more.  All right, Tom.  We're going to play a...  I also live with Barry Manilow.  You want to deal with him?  And he's got a...  You know he's got a beagle named Bagel?  Yeah!  The dog is named Bagel.  He lives on Horatio Street.  You're damn right. 
[02:34:30]  He's named Bagel.  And he used to hang out down in some of those flicky bars.  Of course.  He used to go down to the nice street where I used to hang out until I met him.  In one of those flicky bars.  And, you know, I was freaking out.  And I wound up hanging out with him.  And how that happened?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I did not know.  I don't know.  Do we got his beers?  Yeah, we got them.  All right, Tom. 
[02:35:00]  We're going to play six hands of Blackjack.  Who's playing Blackjack?  I'll put up $10 a hand.  All right.  If you beat Anthony, you get the $10.  Simple as that.  Where's the $10 coming from?  I'll throw it right on the table.  Don't worry.  Oh, way over there.  Blackjack.  And how many beers?  Oh, no, way over there.  Who's dealing?  How many beers?  And you got...  Tom.  This guy might be slick.  Tom, you got six beers.  We got a bucket.  Tom, here's the deal. 
[02:35:30]  If you lose...  We're going to give you a six-pack.  Well, I just want a beer.  All right, listen.  You got to win the beer.  Wow, look at all those.  Well, I'm working on a beer right now.  Listen.  If you win the hand of Blackjack, this is what happens.  You win the $10 and you get a beer.  We don't need a beer.  If you lose...  I get no beer.  Wow!  You are good.  I finally got a whip.  Oh, you did.  Wow!  All right, Tom.  I want to know who the deal is. 
[02:36:00]  Danny's got a deal.  It's Danny.  He's legit.  Stanley's legit?  Yeah, Stanley.  Stanley is legit.  We got a bucket?  It's Stanley.  I'm not big enough for that.  I want to know.  Listen, Tom.  You lose the hand of Blackjack.  You don't get the $10 and we pour one of your beers out that we're giving you.  That's not nice.  I know it's not nice.  Yeah, it's not nice.  It's not nice.  All right, who's going to be in charge of the beers?  We're going to hurt my feelings.  We're not hurting your feelings. 
[02:36:30]  We're just playing.  It's a gamble.  You got to have something at stake to make it interesting.  Yeah!  All right?  Beers, that's a good stake.  All right.  Who wants to play?  Tom, here's your first $10.  Going down.  Wait a minute.  Going down.  Don't touch it.  Oh, shit.  You beat Anthony in this hand of Blackjack.  You get that $10 and you get to take a beer off the table.  Who's Dylan?  Me.  All right?  Mike.  He's Dylan.  Travis.  Yeah, get a mic in front of you.  Mike.  This could be very profitable for you.  Mike Dylan?  Nope.  No, that's a mic. 
[02:37:00]  Now, Stanley.  Mike, are you Dylan?  Oh, God.  All right, here we go.  Jesus.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Hold your mic.  Here we go.  Mike, are you Dylan?  Yeah.  Okay, give me the right hand.  Stanley.  So I can win.  All right, here we go.  We're going.  I'll split it with you.  I guess one up.  Something like that.  Okay, he got it.  One up, one down.  One up, one down.  Anthony versus Tippy Tom.  A little 21. 
[02:37:30]  We don't really need the deals.  Oh, I already won.  No, it's just.  Oh, we'll just play against us, too.  Yeah.  That's great.  Yeah, that's all right.  Just take those and bury them.  All right, Tippy Tom, look at your cards.  I want one more hit.  One more hit.  Keep the cards on the table, sir.  Yeah, keep the cards on the table.  We heard about your cheating.

Oh, I love a card.  You got to keep your cards on the table so we can see them.  Why don't you look for them back?  Gamey.  All right. 
[02:40:30]  He's showing an eight.  You can't see what I got.  No, I can see the eight.  Leave the eight turned up.  We're allowed to see the eight.  No, wait, Tom.  You got to hide it.  Jesus.  All right.  Tom just got a six.  So he's got an eight and a six showing right now.  What do you got, Tom?  Don't say it.  Don't.  You're staying.  What do you got?  He's trying to count.  Shut up.

You lost.  Hold on.  You lost.  Oh, Tom.  Oh, boy, Tom. 
[02:41:30]  Hold on, Tom.  You lost, so you don't get the $10 on that hand.  14, 15, 17, 17, 18.  Yeah, 18.  I didn't win?  No.  Hold on.  Here, here.  Tom.  And because you didn't win, we take one of your beers.  I didn't win.  And.  Oh, shit.  Oh, Tom.  One of your beers just gets dumped.  Now it's garbage.  Yeah, all right.  All right.  Next hand.  I thought I won.  Another 10.  I thought I won.  You would be great in Vegas.  Another $10 on the table, Tom. 
[02:42:00]  All right, Tom.  Another 10 on the table.  Did he have to give back his 10?  He should be.  He should have to give back the 10.  Yeah, but the fucking listeners would kill me.  I'm getting busy.  I really want that 10.  I'm itching.  I'm messing around now.  All right.  You're not messing around.  Hold on.  I've been living in Nevada half my life for no reason.  All right, Tippy.  Here's the next beer.  It's nice.  We got four beers left on the table.  A melodic city. 
[02:42:30]  And another 10 on the table.  Here we go.  Next hand, Blackjack.  Tippy Tom versus Anthony.  All right.  Tippy Tom showing a 10.  A 10.  And Ant showing a 10.  A couple of 10s up top.  All right.  Got a couple of 10s.  A couple of 10s up top.  Looks like you're out of office.  He's talking smack.  Yeah, he is.  Out of office.  And he's smiling at you.  Are you getting a car or are you staying?  I know where I'm going.  I don't have to go nowhere.  You're staying?  You're damn right.  All right.  I got 20. 
[02:43:00]  What do you got?  Oh, my God.  We're even steaming.  Another push?  Another fucking push.  All right.  We pushed.  All right.  You got lucky there.  You got lucky there, Tom.  I want that $10 bill.  All right.  We're going to play for that 10 on the table.  Tom should have to put his 10 up at one point, too.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, he would have to put his 10 up against the beer.  Well, I'll put a 10 up sooner or later when I get your money.  We'll do a double or nothing at 10. 
[02:43:30]  All right.  Here we go.  That's what we'll do.  All the money he wins, double or nothing on one hand.  All right, Tom.  Here's the next 10.  Here we go.  All right.  Tom is showing a seven.  And I got a king of diamonds.  I'm going to take another hit, though.  All right, Tom.  Oh, that could be good.  He's got some fucking good cards.  He just got a three.  Showing a seven and a three.  We're king, 16, 17, 18, 19.  Come on.  Oh, well.  What have you got?  I got 20.  All right.  Yeah.  Let me say.  All right, Tom.

You want to mess with me, sir?  You don't mess with me.  I'll share this with you.  No, that's okay.  I'm fine.  Tom's beating Ant.  Ant can't focus because of the smell, though.  I've been in a while.  No.  We're kind of tied right about now.  Yeah, I guess you're right. 
[02:45:30]  Tom, here's your next 10 on the table.  Here you go.  Come on.  Next 10 on the table.  Let's get busy here.  This is a crucial end here.  We got two beers left on the table, Tom.  All right.  I want to win them beers.  All right.  You've won two beers so far.  20 bucks.  Doing pretty good.  All right.  Yeah.  I want $10, too.  All right.  Here we go.  Here it is.  Deal the cards, Stanley.  Tom's showing a nine and showing a two.  What do you got? 
[02:46:00]  I'm showing a two.  Oh, man.  I might break if I hit.  Want to give it a shot?  Let's give it a go.  Oh, boy.  It's two.  I got it. 
[02:46:30]  You motherfucker.  He just got a two.  You can't fuck me, Tippi Tom.  He's showing 11.  And showing a two right now.  You want another hit?  No, I'm good with that.  All right.  I'm going with that.  I'm going to win nobody with that.  All right.  All right.  Give me a hit there.  I'm going to lose.  Ah, damn it.  Oh, shit.  What did Tom have?  16.  16.  I just had a 12, so I had a hit on it. 
[02:47:00]  16.  You hear that?  You're fucking killing me here.  That's right.  There's another 10 and another beer for Tom.  This isn't working out too well for us.  Oh, man.  See?  How did he hit that with a two and stick on 16?  He's a better player.  Sticks on 16.  No, he's one of these cocksuckers that fucking end up next to me.  I need another 10.  He's staying on a 16.  He's giving you a fucking thrashing.  Now I got to make a bet.  All right.  Here's your next 10 there, Tom. 
[02:47:30]  Let's see what Tommy can do now.  All right.  All right.  I just put some money up.  Well, we're going to let you put up all your money at the end for one hand.  Double or nothing, I'm thinking.  It's going to be a big one.  This guy might be really good.  He might win.  All right.  I'm a little scared of him, so I'm not sure.  All right.  Here we go.  Ant versus Tippi Tom.  Tippi Show.  Yeah.  Ant showing a five.  Ant showing a five.  All right.  Looks like I want to win again. 
[02:48:00]  Shit.  Are you staying?  You staying?  I'm holding right now.  All right.  I need a card.  All right.  No.  Broke.  No.  No good.  No.  I didn't break yet, sir.  I think you both.  Need another.  Oh, Ant needs another.  Ant showing 14.  Ain't got no.  Oh, my God.  How'd he get that?  I'll stay there on an 18.  Oh, shit.  Tom, what do you got?  Actually, it's 17. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, it's a push.  How much you got?  I got 18.  Did he beat you again?  You're killing me.  What you got?  You're fucking killing me.  I said 18, but I have 17.  I got 18.  I'm staying here.  You won, Tom.  You won, Tom.  All right.  That's my money?  Yes, that's your money.  That's right.  Just more beer if you want.  And another beer.  Fucking.  Now, here's the deal, Tom.  Here's the deal, Tom.  Tom, focus.  Whoa.  Whoa.  I'm playing poker right now. 
[02:49:00]  You can put poker.  We're done with the beers.  You can put all your money on the table for one hand, double or nothing.  Here it goes.  Double or nothing.  Take all the money you just won out of your pockets.  Put it on the table if you want the table.  Of course I will.  Or you could just walk away with the money.  Hey, my one.  Now, where are you going?  All right.  I mean, walk away was kind of figurative, but.  All right, Tom.  Where am I going to go?  Yeah, I'm going to go.  Oh, where?  Tom, put your money on the table then.  It doesn't stay here.  Tom, put your money on the table. 
[02:49:30]  All right.  Who's playing?  Put your money on the table, Tom.  One hand, double or nothing.  All the money you won.  All the money you won.  Count it up.  And the beers.  Get all the beers back on the table, too.  I'm going to hope I don't want it.  Get all the beers on the table, as well.  God damn, he drinks them fast.  Yeah, this is all.  All right.  It's a bit of a problem for him.  What is he doing?  Do you think he was a moderate drinker?  All right, Tom.  Put your money on the table.  How much money you got?  All right.  No, I'll match your money.  Let's see.  No, we'll match yours. 
[02:50:00]  How much you got?  How much you got?  I forgot how many hands you won.  Did he win?  No, no, no.  He won 40.  Take your 10 back out.  Yeah, okay.  Put your money.  Now, how much do you have?  40?  He won 40.  I ain't got that much.  Put your money on the table.  We're not going to take it.  All of it?  Count it up.  Yeah, we're going double or nothing right now.  Double or nothing on what you want.  So you could win twice as much.  How about $10?  No, no.  You got to do it all.  All or nothing, Tom.  What should I do?  Keith, what should you... 
[02:50:30]  Double or nothing sounds like...  You could walk away with like 80, 90 bucks.  You could walk away with a lot of money, bro.  It's all up to you.  Double or nothing.  20 bucks.  No, it's got...  Where the match at?  All right, well...  You don't trust that...  Why are you putting that back in your pocket?  Want to play all of you?  You only got to play at all.  He just gave me money.  20 bucks.  You got to play at all.  All right, we'll do a 20 buck.  All right, so Tom...  But then he walks away with something.  I might need to have something in my pocket.  Tom?  Guess I lose. 
[02:51:00]  Double or nothing.  But if I fucking win...  Tom, here, look.  See that.  Take a bet, Tom.  Take a gamble.  That's $100.  All your money...  All your money that you have in your pocket right now  against this $100.  All the money and all the beer.  All the beer?  Yeah.  All the money and all the beer against my $100.  So I have nothing in case you win.  Or you get all the money that you have,  all the beer and another $100. 
[02:51:30]  No.  Ant's putting up $100.  You put up the $100.  I put up $100.  How'd you win?  If I win, that's gambling, bro.  Then you have nothing.  Well, let's just play with this.  No, we got to go all or nothing.  That's why I'm putting up $100.  That's a good deal.  You got $40.  You only got $40.  You're going to walk out with $140.  You're going to walk out with $140 in all these beers.  Suppose I lose.  Well, that's...  I should have thought about that 20 years ago.  See, that's... 
[02:52:00]  I go for it.  That's gambling.  You're getting odds here.  You're actually getting odds.  Tom.  And we'll double the beers, too.  So, you got three on the table.  You'll get six beers.  All I got is $40.  It should be $40.  $20, $30.  It should be $40.  I think he's fucking cornhole in a goddamn $10.  Put it up.  Come on.  If I'm putting up $100, you got to put up the entire $40.  Tom.  We've been keeping $10.  There it is.  Put the $40 down here.  Keith's got to be the keeper of the cash. 
[02:52:30]  $40.  Put the $40 on the table.  This is what...  Listen to me.  Keith is the keeper of the cash.  Wait.  I want to wait until he puts his money up.  Leave him with a buck.  I got a buck for you.  Yeah.  Keith's got a buck for you.  All right.  Give the money to Keith.  Give me all the money.  All the money.  All right.  You got $40.  $40.  Stop trying to cornhole.  Give me that.  Tom.  Here's the $100.  $140.  That's the pot.  Listen to me.  Tom.  Focus.  Tom.  Hey.  Where's my beer at?  All right.  You got your beer.  Listen.  Tom.  You win this hand of blackjack.  You're going to win the $140.  All this money. 
[02:53:00]  And you're going to win all the...  Why are you doing that money?  Listen.  And you're going to...  Let it be noted.  He was pointing at me.  All right.  You...  And Tom.  You're going to win all these beers as well.  $140 at six beers if you beat Anthony on one more hand of blackjack.  One hand.  Here we go.  All right.  Come on.  Here we go.  Come on.  Or nothing.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Here it is.  Big hand.  Tom's showing a three.  Tom's showing a three.  And showing a ten. 
[02:53:30]  Hold on.  Another hit.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Are you taking a hit?  Okay.  This is it.  All right.  That's it.  That's the way you got to work.  What do you got?  What do you got, Tom?  Seven.  Is he staying?  You're hitting?  13, 14, 15, 16, 17.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Let me look.  He might beat me.  Let me look.  Let me look.  Let's make sure.  Let me look.  Let's take a look at what you got, Tom.  He has...  He's got 14.  He's got 14.  He's got 14.  Oh, man.  How much do you got?  You have 14.  I have a 10 showing. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I go one more.  It's 14.  14.  And showing a 10.  Yeah.  He's showing 10.  He's showing a 10.  What do you think, Tom?  So we go in?  Big decision.  You got to go one more card.  I would go one more.  Big decision.  So we go for another card?  One more.  I go for another card.  All right.  $140.  Hold on.  $140 at stake.  Six beers.  Six beers.  Tom's thinking of hitting on 14.  14.  That's 7 and that's 14. 
[02:54:30]  I'm showing a 10, so he's got to hit on a 14, right?  All right.  Give him a card.  Here we go.  Want that one more?  You better feel right, man.  I'll get my gun.  14.  Oh!  Damn.  He pulls a six.  Holy shit.  He pulls a six.  Oh, shit.  We're talking 20.  Tom's got time.  Tom's got 20.  What do you think?  Who's going to kick my ass?  Holy shit.  Hold on.  Let's see what's going on.  You're good at 20, right, Tom?  You're staying on 20? 
[02:55:00]  All right, listen.  Hold on.  We got $140 on the table.  Six beers.  Tom's got a 20.  Anthony, it's to you.  Tom?  Blackjack.  Oh!  There's your 100, man.  I'll take my money back.  And dump all the beers.  Oh, Tom.  I'm sorry.  Holy shit.  Oh, no.  What a devastating loss for Tippi Tom that was.  Tom, that's just like what happened in your life.  That's exactly what happened in your life. 
[02:55:30]  Oh!  Holy shit.  Tippi Tom is down.  Wow.  Tippi Tom is down.  Tippi Tom is down.  You hurt my feelings, man.  You know what I'm saying?  I thought I was going to win.  You had a 20.  You pulled a miracle six for a 20.  I had 20 here.  Oh, that hurt.  Oh, Tom.  That's going to leave a place.  That had to fucking hurt.  Oh, boy.  It could have worked out better.  Oh, Tom.  You know you broke my heart.  You should have stayed with the 40 bucks. 
[02:56:00]  You had 40 bucks.  Why'd you bet it?  And now it's gone.  Now you got no beers and no money.  No beer.  No fucking money.  No nothing.  No nothing.  You had all those beers and 40 bucks.  You could have had a fucking party tonight.  That's right.  Could have gotten a hooker.  Yeah!  All right.  Tom, we're done with you.  Scram.  We got a radio show.  Yeah, we don't need losers.  We don't hang out with losers.  All right.  I lost.  Maybe there's a video clip we could watch. 
[02:56:30]  You know, a Meryl Streep film perhaps.  All right.  I'm a loser.  Oh, my God.  That couldn't work out better.  No, I lost.  Oh, Tom.  Damn, that sucks.  You lost it all.  A hundred and forty dollars and six beers.  Yeah.  Tippi Tom's very unhappy.  Tippi Tom's unhappy.  How do you feel?  I don't feel very good.  Tippi Tom don't feel good.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I lost all that money.  Damn.  You had so much money. 
[02:57:00]  And I won all that money.  Fucking Danny.  Why?  I don't know why.  Just for the hell of it.  Fucking Danny's a dirty dealer.  Motherfucker.  Fucking.  Oh, no.  Let's him get a twenty, too.  Oh, no.  He doesn't even give him like a nineteen.  He gives him a twenty.  You know what the weird thing is?  I gained ten dollars on that whole thing.  How did that happen?  Oh, it's yours, then?  All right.  There's your ten.  Give me Tom.  Fucking Danny's a dirty dealer. 
[02:57:30]  No more gamblers left?  Danny lets him get a twenty.  Fucking.  Not only did he get paid in black, he gave him a twenty.  I saw the A's.  I go, oh, my God.  He goes, I know.  Because it would have been funner if he won.  Yeah.  Yeah, right?  Something's wrong with you gambling.  Something's wrong with our gambling?  Why, Tom?  Because.  Are you calling us cheaters?  I think someone was cheating. 
[02:58:00]  This is a legit joint.  Cheaters?  Why, I.  I think a dealer had a problem with this.  Really?  Yeah.  You can't say bad things about.  He.  He slipped me.  The booby card.  I live in Reno, Nevada for years.  Yeah, you do.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm not a joke.  You thought you.  And.  No.  You saw me.  You caught a hanger?  Caught a hanger? 
[02:58:30]  Well, listen.  We're going to take a break, Tom.  That's how the cookie crumbles.  What can I tell you?  You know?  It happens.  And.  Well.  Tom, I poured all the beers out into the bucket.  Maybe you could just drink out of the bucket, Tom.  Why not?  Why not, man?  Why not, right?  A spackle bucket.  We were pouring the beers into a spackle bucket.  There might be some liquid at the bottom of that thing.  I want to win the money.  Well, maybe we'll.  Maybe we'll think of something else for you. 
[02:59:00]  All right.  But for now, we take our money back.  All right.  No, we'll do that after the break.  Okay.  We got some.  Who the hell was that?  We'll explain next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  This is not what I'm used to.  Here it is, live.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Nothing but foul language and toilet humor.  For the new listeners who think that we've learned our lesson.  Uh-uh.  Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.  Poopy.  Malarkey.  Piney.  Cooley.  Let me shitter.  I get it. 
[02:59:30]  Someone pinch me.  Whoop-a-dee-doo.  K-sirah-sirah.  Mumbo-jumbo.  Good natured joshing around.  Puppy cock.  Poopy jokes.  Silly.  Hum-a-na-hum-a-hum-a-hum-a.  We just chit-chat and go nuts.  What do you think of them apples?  It's lame.  It's not even fun to listen to, you know?  I don't know how they could screw up something that simple.  Oh-ah!  But boy, they sure did.  Opie and Anthony!  You got to know when to hold up. 
[03:00:00]  Know when to fold up.  Know when to walk away.  We are back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Just tuning in.  Opie and Anthony!  Tom took a gamble and he lost it all.  He had a chance at $140 and six beers.  He went for it.  And because Danny rigged the deck, Tom lost it all.  21 to 20.  Hey, Tom, how are you doing over there? 
[03:00:30]  Hey, Jimmy.  Tom's doing fine.  How are you doing over there?  Pretty good.  What just happened on the radio?  What?  My favorite radio?  What?  Yeah.  What just happened on the radio?  Well, I like Howard Stern.  You don't like him?  He's awesome.  Well, after what we did to you, I expected you to say that.  You don't like Howard Stern?  I'm sure the advertisers over there love hearing that.  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  I unfortunately have to tear down a wall for a bunch of cunts out there. 
[03:01:00]  This guy, a lot of negative feedback coming in.  What?  Well, this one says it all.  I'm a negative guy.  This cunt who doesn't leave his real name, of course not.  Just a mobile phone number.  He writes, above radio, question mark, you rigged a game of 21 with a millionaire against  a homeless guy.  Fucking cunts.  So now I have to tear down a fucking wall. 
[03:01:30]  No, we don't.  Fuck him.  Huh?  Fuck him.  Yeah.  We rigged a game.  Go fuck yourself.  Wait a minute.  You said go fuck yourself.  Fuck yourself.  Isn't that horrible?  And all it comes, you said bad words.  My mommy slapped you in your face.  No, I don't think she will.  I think I have to tear down a wall just because these idiots that think they know everything,  they don't know shit about this radio show on so many levels.  Here's the fucking deal, but it doesn't make for good radio. 
[03:02:00]  Trust me.  Tom is leaving the goddamn XM facility and he'll be taken care of just fine.  Yeah, we'll beat him up.  So go fuck yourself.  But that doesn't make for good radio.  No, let me talk to them.  Fucking asshole.  Just fucking enjoy the entertainment.  Half the listeners, Tom.  Half of them.  Half of them.  Hey, look.  Timmy Tom is here.  Yeah.  Now, I want to know who the real asshole is. 
[03:02:30]  Because I want to hang out with the real asshole.  Do you?  See.  I want to hang out with no bullshit asshole.  All right, listen.  Tom.  I want a real asshole.  Timmy Tom.  I want a real asshole.  Here's the problem.  Like Jimmy said during the break, that alcohol is a bitch.  Because Tom has had three or four beers.  Now he's impossible to control.  Now he's.  See the difference?  Now he's off and running.  Off and running.  Tom.  Tom.  What, sir? 
[03:03:00]  All right.  We want to show you a clip.  Jimmy suggested that we get you a couple clips that you might like today.  Can you see the big screen right there?  Up top?  I am.  Sam, point to the screen.  He should be.  Okay, it's on all screens.  All right.  Look at the screen.  Tell us what's going on.  Of course, with that chick, I don't like.  But earlier, you said you liked her.  Well, she's okay.  Oh, God.  The studio's filling up.  Okay.  Oh, we got Nazis here. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, what are you showing us Nazi shit?  About the Germans?  Nazis.  No, that's.  That's.  This is your favorite movie.  No.  Sophie's Choice.  Look.  No, Sophie's Choice is very different.  No, look.  See?  It's Meryl Streep.  It's the daughter.  You're right.  Here it is.  Here's your movie.  You're right.  Look at that fine gentleman.  All right, listen to the movie.  No, he has a mess.  Tom, listen to the movie.  Here we go.  We'll play in this scene that made him cry earlier on the show. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah.  Or Meryl Streep has to give up one of her kids.  We're watching the version dubbed in German. 
[03:04:30]  This is not the English version.  No, he's coming.  Come and see here.  That Nazi son of a bitch.  Look, I'm German.  And I don't like what they did.  What did they do, Tom?  Because no one speaks fucking German here.  They killed people. 
[03:05:00]  He's kind of communist.  I speak German.  No one can understand it.  He's didn't kill you.  I speak Spanish and German.  I mean, Steve from Bayshore.  I love Germany.  I love America.  Right.  This is the end of the movie.  Like, some of it's in English.  Some of it's in German.  And this part happens to be in German.  There's no subtitles on this particular clip.  Uh-huh.  I guess you're supposed to know what's going on kind of a thing. 
[03:05:30]  And Danny's not happy now.  What?  The Germans are wrong.  The Germans are wrong.  But they did.  What'd they do?  Tommy, this is your favorite movie.  Explain what's going on.  Because we don't know German.  Tell us what's going on.  The only good thing the Germans did is build a Volkswagen and a Mercedes-Benz.  That's all I ever did right. 
[03:06:00]  And I'm German.  Right.  Well, this is.  My name is Schultz.  Hey, Tippi.  That's German.  This is the scene that got you sad.  Here it comes.  The Nazis talking to Meryl Streep as she's holding her daughter.  What's going on?  Tell us.  She's protecting her child.  Here we go.  Here we go.  They got a still her baby.  There's a tragic movie. 
[03:06:30]  No.  It's moving from my heart.  They stole her baby.  Because it's not the kind of waiting camp in Germany.  No.  No.  No.  And tell her.  Damn it.  Damn it.  And Meryl Streep, she's drumming him. 
[03:07:00]  That movie's so tragic.  I was wrong.  The Germans were wrong.  And I'm German.  And I'm wrong.  I didn't do that.  I would never do that.  That was your people, though.  Yeah.  You know.  Well, I was raised that way, but I'm not that way. 
[03:07:30]  Tom, why are you so upset?  I don't get it.  Yeah, you got so upset watching that clip.  Why are you so upset?  There's tears in your eyes.  It was wrong.  Why'd they take the little baby?  It was wrong.  What was wrong about that?  I'm sure he was taking the kids to get some good health care or something.  In those times, things were different, I guess.  You ain't gonna boo that shit now. 
[03:08:00]  Why'd they take the baby, though?  The little baby got taken.  Oh, look.  She's.  Oh, no.  Look.  Look.  Here's the scene.  This is what bothers you?  Yes.  It's Meryl Streep.  It's still her baby.  That's wrong.  No.  Hey. 
[03:08:30]  I would go fight.  Yeah.  Fight those Nazis.  That's a funny movie, right?  Did you laugh when you watched that movie?  That's funny.  I like movies, yeah.  What a rebound.  Wow.  Hey, Tom, what else makes you sad?  Sad or glad?  Sad. 
[03:09:00]  Well, there's a lot of sad movies out there.  But let's talk about something glad.  Like what?  Um, okay, here's a guy, he's a German.  Come with me, and you'll be in a world of your imagination.  Take a look at a book, and you'll be in your imagination. 
[03:09:30]  I can't sing a like.  It's Willy Wonka and a chocolate factory.  He had chocolate.  You got a chocolate factory in your pants today, Tom.  You're making your own chocolate today, aren't you, sir?  Well, I did that earlier.  Yeah.  Well, I'm saying that.  Willy Wonka make the best chocolate.  Yeah.  I'm thinking, uh, tippy-tom. 
[03:10:00]  Hey, fucking German shit.  Yes, I'm German, Tommy.  I'm German.  I'm thinking tippy-tom, underpants, mustache today.  Tippy-tom.  Oh, God.  Oh, is that evil?  I'm just thinking, that's all.  Thinking tippy-tom, underpants, mustache today.  You'll do it?  I don't know, man.  That's rough.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  That baby diaper thing was rough, man.  What'd I do wrong?  That was rough.  Nothing, Tom. 
[03:10:30]  How about you just put them on your face and wear them for a second?  Like a hat.  Whoa, that's that.  That's nice.  That's that.  Tom, take your underpants off.  Like a ski mask?  Let's see what you got brewing in your underpants.  Oh, God.  You gotta buy them.  We'll buy them from you.  Yeah, we'll buy your underpants.  Look, I do that on the Johnny Carson show only.  Johnny Carson?  Well, how much do you want to sell your underpants for?  Your mom on there.  Yeah.  I think your mom's on Johnny Carson, right?  Exactly. 
[03:11:00]  How much do you want to sell your underpants for?  My underpants?  Well, I ain't got none.  Huh?  Oh, you're going to underpants?  No, we saw underpants.  They were a bit gray, but...  Yeah, a little fucked up.  Uh, ooh.  I can't say that, right?  No, you can.  You can over here.  Yeah, he'd never get them off, though, because he's a pants that are stuck on his legs.  Look how that one is just...  Well, what I can say is this.  Cut them off him.  Who's going to smell the leg?  Wait a minute. 
[03:11:30]  Who's going to sniff my underpants?  Underpants.  You got to be worthy.  Oh, well.  You get drunk real easy, by the way.  Well, I drink a beer.  That's true.  Where's Pat fucking Duffy today?  Well, I'm saying...  Pat fucking Duffy.  Oh, no.  Here comes Pat Duffy.  How am I going to talk to you when you're talking to me?  Come up here with the big boys.  Ooh.  Ooh.  That's exciting.  I see that you got a beard. 
[03:12:00]  Yes.  And it's lacking a mustache.  Right.  I don't grow a mustache.  Well, we might be able to add a mustache on to you.  I would love one.  Would you reenact baby diaper mustache with Tippi Tomm's underpants?  Oh, no, you wouldn't.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  Oh, my God.  I don't want to go over.  Well, he ain't getting it.  Oh, my God.  You hardly have the phone.  All right.  Listen, Keith.  I'm nauseous. 
[03:12:30]  Keith, help us out.  I know your feet are up and you're enjoying yourself, but how do we get his underpants off?  Alabama, motherfucker.  Harder, you have the phone.  You need to scissor him off.  Yeah.  Tom.  We have gloves?  I'm from Jersey.  Tom.  Give him Alabama.  Tom, I got...  No, wait a minute.  Tom, I got cold hard cash for you.  We're playing Let's Make a Deal.  Listen to me.  Listen.  We're playing Deal or No Deal.  All right?  Let's Make a Deal.  All right.  Here's the deal. 
[03:13:00]  I got some cold hard...  Oh, boy.  He's not listening.  All right.  Tom.  Tom.  Focus.  Well, let me talk.  Tom, listen to me.  I got a deal for you.  He keep pulling a fucking phone out of my mouth.  Tom.  I got cold hard cash in front of me.  Where's it at?  Right here.  Look.  Over here.  See?  I can't see that cash.  All right.  Keith, here's cold hard cash.  Lots of it.  I don't see it right now. 
[03:13:30]  You can get back some of the money you lost gambling.  No, more than some.  There's a nice pile of money there, Tom.  All we need...  Whoa.  All we need...  Here's the deal.  You get all that money if we get your underpants.  You want them?  Yeah.  You can have them anytime.  All right.  Should we cut them off, yeah?  Yeah.  Let's cut those underpants off.  Talks like Pacino in every movie.  Hey.  Wow.  A bad man.  Yeah.  Got shit in my pants.  You want to smell my underwear? 
[03:14:00]  Hoo-ah.  Keith, get on mic so we can hear the wheeling and dealing that's going on.  How much, Tippy Tom, to buy the underpants you have on right now?  That sort of costs a lot of money.  Because these underpants are a relic.  When I was born in Egypt... 
[03:14:30]  Listen to me.  I had an underpants for 2,000 years.  Okay, so...  Hey, hold on a minute.  Can we get some...  One of the 20 people that work for us to go get him new underpants right now from somewhere?  So he walks away with new underpants, too, on top of it.  You can go right down to...  Give him an O&A thong. 
[03:15:00]  I promise I will.  All right.  We're getting him new underpants.  O&A thong.  He just has to walk around in that fucking thing.  I thought I was going to get a funeral.  All right, back to Keith.  Keith, wheel and deal.  All right, Tippy Tom, you said...  I hope Keith don't love me no more.  Pay attention.  You said it's going to cost a lot of money.  How much is a lot?  $5 for your underpants?  Yeah, I think so.  All right.  Wow.  All right, that was a quick negotiation. 
[03:15:30]  You are in a deal.  All right, give me some change back then.  Give me some change back then.  When they're shitting your pants, take a fin for them.  Right.  $5 for your underpants, it's going to work really good with me.  All right, Sam, you got some juice in that camera?  Yeah.  No, I'm trying to get Keith's money.  All right, we should start rolling here.  Let's do it.  We're thinking...  Whoa.  What are you talking about?  Let's get them cut off.  Keith, you need gloves, too, right?  All right, Tom, get up.  You know what?  Stand up.  Give me another fucking wireless. 
[03:16:00]  I'll go there.  All right, Keith.  Yeah, go over there with that smell.  Dude, I don't know what propels it.  Like, once in a while, it just belts me in the mouth.  Yeah.  It just comes off.  It goes, now it's okay, but then it'll just wail.  It'll just wail you right in the face.  Just when it catches me up.  Wait a minute.  The table is happy right here.  Why are you moving the happy table over there?  All right.  Is this on? 
[03:16:30]  Talk it to you.  I'll tell you.  Hey, hey, okay.  All right, who's talking now?  I'm going to eat my egg sandwich and smell what Tom's cooking.  Oh, God.  How do you do that?  Where's your sandwich at?  I'm hungry.  Give him a bite.  I'm showing him.  Give me a sandwich right now.  Oh, my God.  Spill it.  All right.  Yeah, falafel.  Falafel.  That falafel.  Give me the rest of that bagel.  Yeah, you should sell it to him. 
[03:17:00]  Tom, how much would you give me for a half a bagel?  Fuck.  I have five.  All right, here.  Give me five bucks.  Here's a half a bagel.  Whoa.  Oh, my God.  Here, hold it.  All right.  I like it.  Okay, I owe you.  All right.  What's a German eating a bagel for?  Look at that.  You're doing your people a disservice.  Eating Barry Manilow's dog.  Tom Manilow's dog is named Bagel. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, damn.  Oh, Barry Manilow's dog.  I know his dog.  What's his name?  It's a bagel hound.  It's named Bagel.  Oh.  I live with Barry Manilow, you nut.  No, you didn't.  You didn't.  Oh, yes, I did.  No, I did.  What's his dog's name?  He's straight in a little apartment.  All right.  Tom, we need your underpants.  Give him the money, Keith.  Yeah, let him stand up.  Let's just get this moving. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah, let's get it moving.  Tom's relaxing like he's in fucking Rico Rizzo in Florida.  All right.  Come on, Tom.  Okay, Tom.  You got to stand up so we can cut your underwear off.  Here's your five dollars.  Tom, stand up so we can cut your underwear off.  Oh, shit.  Oh, boy.  I love you, Grandpa.  I think he's going to.  All right, Tom.  Tom, let's go.  Stand up, Tom.  Stand up so we can give you, we're going to give you a fresh underpants and money.  Well, let me drink the beer first. 
[03:18:30]  Just stand up.  I think I have.  Okay.  All right, take the beer away.  That seems to be the catalyst for this, this situation.  Tom.  Put it in the bucket.  We're going to give you the beer in a second.  I want the beer.  All right, get up.  Tom, please get up.  All right, please get up.  One, two.  All right, get up.  All right.  All right, Tom.  Take your coat off.  What a lightweight.  Woo.  Tom, take your coat off.  Oh, you want me to get naked?  Well, not necessarily. 
[03:19:00]  All right, we just need your underpants, so get the coat off.  You want to get nude?  Well.  It might help.  Just pull them down a little, Tom, the underpants.  Just pull the jeans.  Just calm down a little bit.  Tom, pull the jeans down.  Let's see that cock and balls.  I dare you.  Shut up.  All right, man.  Shut up.  All right, Paul.  He's flirting with me.  Yeah, he is.  Don't try to be coy.  He got all coy with you.  He did.  Oh, go on with yourself.  Oh, for sure. 
[03:19:30]  Masher.  Don't laugh at me.  For sure.  What the fuck?  Where's E-Rock?  E-Rock should be cutting the underpants off him.  E-Rock, come on.  He's got a little dick.  What's he?  I'm doing production.  Get in here.  All right.  Pull your jeans down so we can get to your underpants.  All right.  All right.  Stand back.  Stand back.  The fuck back.  All right, E-Rock, could you, yeah, put the gloves on.  We're attempting to.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Nice game. 
[03:20:00]  There's no effing way.  Oh, my God.  Look at those underwear.  They're yellow.  Oh, my God.  There's a fucking load in the back of them.  Oh, they're not just yellow.  Oh, my God.  What's the matter?  You act like you've never seen fucking filthy underpants.  Put them fucking teeth feet away.  Wait a minute.  Fuck, get away from me.  What?  You don't love my legs?  I love your legs.  The legs are.  Tom, you shit your pants.  Your legs are fucked up.  All right, E-Rock.  Oh, my God.  E-Rock.  Hold on.  I didn't even see that.  Yeah. 
[03:20:30]  Oh, my camera and I need.  Yeah.  All right, Tom.  All right, E-Rock.  Get E-Rock in there.  See, we got new underpants for you.  That's why I hurt my ass.  Because I tell you right now, when I go to the beach this year, I go to Long Island.  Pull his pants up.  All right, listen.  I swear to God.  Keith, you got to help us out.  We're going to cut your underpants off and give you new underpants.  All right, E-Rock.  Get in there.  Pull your pants down.  Pull your pants down.  Let me cut your underpants off.  Yeah, we got to cut the underpants off.  We got to get new underpants on you.

No, no, don't sit.  Have him turn around again, too, because that was an amazing sight.  Make sure you get that on camera.  All right, Tom.  You got to see this.  Tom, pull your shoes down.  Just rip him down there, and then now turn around.  Turn him around, Keith.  Keith, turn him around.  Turn him around.  Turn around.  Turn around.  Turn around.  Turn around.  Hold on.  Turn around. 
[03:21:30]  Turn around.  Let him stand right there.  E-Rock, just get over there with the scissors.  It's all you.  Hey, wait a minute.  We're going to hurt you.  We're buying you under.  We're paying you for him.  Tom, get on the stage.  Get on the stage right there.  On the stage.  Get on the stage.  See the spotlight?  Right here, the spotlight.  Timmy Tom is on the stage.  All right, E-Rock, get in there.  We got to cut the underpants off.  Sam's got to move a little bit.  There you go.  Thanks.  All right, get in there, E-Rock.  I'm not good underpants.  E-Rock, get in there. 
[03:22:00]  Oh, God.  I am the real.  Tippi Tom, turn around.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Face that way so we can see a button.  I got to see the back of those things.  Yeah, look at me for a second.  Look at the back of those things.  Hold on.  All right, perfect.  Perfect.  You're right there.  No, no.  Eric, get him now.  Eric, get over here.  Come on.  Let's go.  You've never cut this shit underwear off a homeless guy before.  Get in there. 
[03:22:30]  Come on.  Let's lay it out there.  Cut him off.  Let's go.  Come on, E-Rock.  Let's go.  Holy shit.  What the fuck is going on?  Don't help.  Don't help.  Oh, God.  Come on, Eric.  You act like you've never done this for a few bucks.  Oh, fucking hell.  We got new underwear.  We got new underwear and money for you.  He has a belt around his gut. 
[03:23:00]  Oh, wait.  What's that?  Come here.  Be careful.  Don't cut him.  Don't cut his dick.  No, no.  He's my doctor.  All right.  He's sweet.  Yes, he is.  E-Rock, get it.  Unlike you.  Come here.  Oh, my good God almighty.  Oh, this is awful.  If I get new underwear, I'll be happy.  All right.  All right.  Oh.  Sorry.  Get the other stuff.  Those have seen better days.  Young.  Seen better days.  The under-fucking-statement of the century. 
[03:23:30]  Oh, E-Rock's bugging.  I get the other stuff.  That looks like something you wear on your head during the Civil War.  Yeah, the Civil War was a good war.  Well.  I was happy.  How's he getting the underwear on, though?  The new one's on.  All right.  All right.  Put it on the table.  Put it on the table.  Just have him put it somewhere.  Put it on the table.  Not on the table.  Put it on the table.  Put it on the table.  Someone take the underwear.  Take the underwear.  Put it right here.  All right. 
[03:24:00]  All right.  All right.  We got the specimen.  Jesus Christ.  All right.  Now we're moving over here.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Listen.  Hold on.  All right.  Wait a minute.  Who's got gloves on?  E-Rock.  I want to see a song.  E-Rock, don't sit on the table.  Go ahead, sweetie.  Belt out of tune.  Go ahead, sister.  You've earned it.  No.  No.  It's not one of them.  No.  E-Rock, get a picture of this.  Get over here.  Is this on Top Talk? 
[03:24:30]  Oh, yeah.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Big mouth.  I'll talk about a thing about Frank.  All right, listen.  E-Rock, open them up and take a picture.  Come on.  We're going to fire you.  I don't know Frank Sinatra.  E-Rock, share the mic with me here.  Come here.  And those used to be white.  Those were white on there.  They are as brown as...  It's amazing, the color.  It's almost like...  It's like the underpants were dyed brown.  Well, am I a white guy?  I did not know that.  E-Rock...  It looks like a skin graft.  All right, like, open them up.  Yeah, they have contents.  Open them up.  Open them up, E-Rock.  You act like you've never done this before. 
[03:25:00]  Oh!  Oh, my God.  Hey!  That's a specimen!  Oh, my God.  This is horrific.  You don't fucking...  E-Rock, get in there again.  Holy shit.  All right, open them up.  On the table.  Fuck with that.  Messing me.  Just open them up on the table.  Open them up.  I think there's an ant in this.  All right. 
[03:25:30]  I can't even explain what this looks like.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  What do you got going over here?  E-Rock, you got to open it up to get the sample fully exposed.  Just get in there.  Get in there and spread it open.  We cut the underpants off.  Oh, my God!  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Don't move.  Don't move it.  Oh, my God.  Don't move it. 
[03:26:00]  Holy shit.  You got to be kidding me.  Someone's in the way.  Someone's in the way.  Someone made a cocky.  What is that?  What is it?  Holy shit.  This is really...  Oh, God.  Damn.  Oh, God.  People are just yelling.  They're screaming.  E-Rock, take a look.  You got to take a look.  I don't know who did it.  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  He goes, I don't know who did it.  It looks like alligator skin.  I don't know.  E-Rock, can you look at that?  It looks like dead alligator skin in his underpants. 
[03:26:30]  Like, so it hurts.  I don't.  All right, listen.  I wasn't sure.  All right, ladies and gentlemen.  All right.  Okay.  I'll come down.  Where's Pat Duffy?  He's right there.  All right, Pat.  Get over here.  All right.  Let's see.  I don't know where to go anyway.  I don't know where to go anyway.  All right.  So I got kicked out of here.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is Pat Duffy, and this is Tippi Tom's. 
[03:27:00]  Yes, sir.  That is true.  Oh, no.  What are you doing, Eric?  Ladies and gentlemen, this is Pat Duffy.  This is Tippi Tom's underwear.  This is Tippi Tom's underpants mustache.  Boy, that's bad news.  Now, that's for sale, by the way. 
[03:27:30]  Should he just wear it on his face?  Wait, wait.  What?  No.  That's for sale.  It's solid.  How about you take your hat off?  Look at this thing.  Yeah, right.  How about you take your hat off, and you just wear it like a head and face mask?  Wait, you know what?  Pat Duffy's like, it's too solid, right?  Yeah, it's too solid.  Look.  Holy crap.  It's, like, petrified.  I know.  There's fucking...  Go get me some water.  Oh, no.  Soften it up.  All right.  Put the sample back down.  Yes.  No, put it back on the underpants. 
[03:28:00]  He's throwing it around against fucking Play-Doh.  Wait.  Let it hit the table again.  Listen to this.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Listen to this.  Listen to this.  I can't...  That was in his underpants.  Oh, God.  Oh, damn it.  Oh, what is that?  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  I'm fucking reactivating it.  All right.  Listen.  Put it back in the underpants.  I can't win with these guys.  No shit.  All right.  We're putting water in the underpants. 
[03:28:30]  I can smell it.  It's not good.  This is going to activate it like fucking...  All right.  We got water in it.  Oh, God damn.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  It's like making that Indian War paint with the rocks.  Whoa.  I'm choosy.  All right.  I think we're ready here.  Yeah, I want spring water.  All right.  You need a mirror?  No, I think I'll be okay.  Spring water.  Here's Pat Duffy.  All right.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Crap.  Oh, my God. 
[03:29:00]  You have nothing on your face, though.  No.  Make a doo-doo mustache, you.  You got to make a doo-doo mustache.  Oh, fuck.  No way.  No way.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  We're above radio. 
[03:29:30]  Can I get hired for this?  Try heaming.  Yeah, he still doesn't get paid.  Come on.  He's try heaming.  He's going to put his fingers through the floor. 
[03:30:00]  I can't wear these guys.  Wow.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Wow.  You all right, Pat?  I'm all right, yeah.  Do we have a towel for him?  All right.  Yeah, get your wipe?  No, it was right there.  Tom was wearing it.  Fucking enjoy your hepatitis.  Don't you have AIDS for real?  No, don't fucking swallow anything.  Get in the bathroom and wash your face and don't ingest anything, obviously. 
[03:30:30]  A shit mustache.  Oh, God damn.  Pat fucking Duffy.  Yeah.  That's what I say today.  That tops anything.  Pat fucking Duffy.  That tops anything I've seen anybody ever do, ever, as far as being disgusting.  I know Eastside Dave, like, ate his own shit, but that's his own shit.  Wait a minute.  Let me get busy here.  Look, I jerk off in the bathroom.  Oh, no. 
[03:31:00]  What the fuck is wrong with that?  Leave him there, Iraq.  What are you doing?  Taking him home for yourself?  Leave him there.  Safe sex.  Don't touch anything with those fucking gloves.  Not a door handle.  That's, I'm not even, you know something?  Iraq just held his hand out and kind of started walking toward me.  It's not even, you wouldn't even, it doesn't frighten me at all.  Because I know there's no fucking way you would do that, because you know I would shoot you.  I would just kill you.  I'll be going to jerk it off.  No, not you. 
[03:31:30]  You're radio gold.  Believe me.  It's right, Sam.  Holy shit.  Sam, what's the problem?  That was easily, I filmed a lot of stuff here.  That was by far the most difficult thing I've ever had to film.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  According to you.  Unbelievable.  Yep.  According to you, I'm allowed to jerk off now.  You certainly are.  All right, Tom.  Thank God.  You can look at any one of us you want.  And I can jerk off.  You want to look at my ass?  In the bathroom. 
[03:32:00]  No, you can sit there and you can look at my ass and jack off if you want.  Dude.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Dude.  I got to tell you, though, really fast.  What was in that, what was in his underpants was basically a rock.  It was petrified shit.  It was a rock.  It was hard as a rock.  Like, it was like chalk, right?  That was a rock.  It was a rock.  It was fossilized shit.  It was, oh, I'm smelling.  Now it's coming off the floor.  Pat, do this with your lip.  No, no.  All right, yeah.  No, it's fine.  I'm fine, yeah.  I just pure-led my whole face.  Ugh. 
[03:32:30]  I can't.  You should actually fucking set it on fire for a minute or two.  I'd like to.  Your whole fucking face.  I'd like to.  You know, like when you burn alcohol with a fucking flambé?  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  This smells so bad in here.  It's amazing.  I'm doing the best job I can to try to win.  But I can't win with you guys.  I know it's going to be a hard fight.  Those were awful underwear.  Holy shit.  Those were not good.  Not good.  That was.  I don't think I'm going to win.  You had wooden duty. 
[03:33:00]  It was.  It was.  I'd never seen.  It looked like when, let's say, there's a rare rain in the desert and then the sun comes  back out and the ground cracks.  Cracks and stuff, yes.  That's what it looked like in his underwear.  Like a dry river bed or something.  With some rocks in there.  It was actually a little model of a little desert environment.  It looked like alligator skin, too.  Yeah.  Brown.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa.  It was a dry rubber bed?  Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah.  You say somebody had a cock that looked like a dry rubber bed?  Yeah, exactly.  Well.  Six runners up.  Wow.  All right.  Tom, we got to do a lot of the day, Tom.  We can't beat that, obviously.  Hey, did Steve try?  Huh?  One more time.  Did Steve try that phone call?  I'm a defense attorney here.  Yeah, we are.  Probably.  Defense attorney?  Tell Steve.  You are?  Oh, yes, sir.  All right, counselor poopy pants. 
[03:34:00]  I'm going to turn his mic off for a second because the guys, Derek and the gang, we got  a new campaign we're running on the Opie and Anthony show called Above Radio.  Above Radio.  Because I was trying to explain that to E-Rock after the Jesse Ventura interview.  So it's a whole series of promos, hopefully starting with this one.  And it's called Above Radio.  I really believe this show is way above radio.  Just a bit of tongue gunk.  We don't get that.  Way above other radio shows. 
[03:34:30]  How about a quick, just a quick sniff?  He's scooping.  Wow.  Oh, this is so disgusting.  It absolutely smells like bad breath, but there's something else mixed in.  No!  Yeah, it assaults you.  Oh, that's not right.  Well, it's not the thing to have bad breath, you know?  There you go.  Above Radio.  Above Radio.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  More coming soon.  What?  Yes, Tippi Tom.  Who's got bad breath? 
[03:35:00]  You know what?  Tippi Tom, surprisingly, does not have bad breath.  No.  How could you tell?  Because I eat Tic Tacs, and I'll promote them, and I eat Tic Tacs to make my breath smell  minty fresh.  Shove some up your ass, please.  Hey, E-Rock!  Well, that's the other part.  Tippi Tom says that he doesn't have bad breath because he eats Tic Tacs.  Oh, no.  I can't do it anymore.  What?  Yeah, he can.  You don't win with that one.  Just a quick little, Tom, just breathe into E-Rock's face. 
[03:35:30]  It smells like a stable in here.  You don't make money with that one.  All right, here we go.  E-Rock, Tippi Tom, just go.  Someone explain what Tom has to do.  Breathe in Eric's face.  Hot air into his face.  Tom, just go.  Into his face.  Go.  How's it going?  I told you I had bad breath.  You know what I'm supposed to say?  Look at him.  He's running out of the building. 
[03:36:00]  That's right.  I need my Tic Tacs.  We didn't say he had his Tic Tacs yet there, E-Rock.  Get my Tic Tacs.  Oh, my God.  This show is a mess.  Yeah, because I breathe in his mouth.  E-Rock, what did that smell like?  It's stink.  What did it smell like?  I don't know.  It got in your mouth?  What?  A piece of food?  I don't smell good.  Part of a rotting cavity?  What got in your mouth?  I think I hurt his feelings. 
[03:36:30]  All right, E-Rock, what does it smell like?  Oh, it's death.  Is it worse than Big A's breath?  No.  No.  Is it worse than Big A's breath?  You have black eyes, Eric.  Why?  I've been throwing up for the last three, four hours.  Oh, my God.  Eric's fucking E-Rock.  E-Rock's got popped blood vessels from throwing up.  You look like the ideal wife.  How many people dry heaved today? 
[03:37:00]  Yes, he ran out of the door and he threw up.  This could be a record.  No.  Is Big A's breath worse?  No.  I didn't mean to do that.  This is way worse than Big A's?  It's way worse than Big A's.  It's not my attention.  Oh, my God.  The tongue's scraping.  But my breath stinks so much.  It did so much.  And he couldn't handle it.  He couldn't handle it.  He's a pussy.  Do you have bad breath, Tom?  Everyone's begging us to replay Pat Duffy.  I think, yeah.  You might have to wait until the replay on that one. 
[03:37:30]  He can't take a real bad breath.  Yeah.  Suppose I got a fart.  Oh, my God.  I don't know what the fuck that would be like.  Leave your body at this point.  There's so much blockage.  I'll clear the room out.  Dude, how the fuck do underpants get like that?  I don't know how to do my show.  He just shits his pants in there.  And then I guess whatever falls out, falls out.  Whatever doesn't, just.  It's amazing.  Because I have a little leakage every once in a while, like just about anyone.  And it's misery until you get in there for a good way. 
[03:38:00]  Well, you live indoors.  Good point.  Good point.  He sleeps under a tree.  Let's do line of the day and get the hell out of here.  Tippi Tom, you're amazing, my friend.  Amazing.  So, Tom, are we going to get you to stop drinking or what?  Well, I feel like it.  Well, we sobered you up once.  It worked out for a little while.  Remember we sent a male stripper to your hotel room?  Yeah.  Hospital room?  I remember, yeah.  You're trying to do your best you can. 
[03:38:30]  That's right, we did.  But you can't help those that don't want to help themselves.  And so I chose to get loaded.  Jesus.  And now what the fuck you think of that?  It's, uh...  All right.  Yeah.  It is what it is.  Suppose you feel like fucking somebody.  Can you put that on the air?  All right.  Jimmy, are you leaving?  I mean, I'll be a klutz car goes to Detroit Saturday.  All right.  You all right? 
[03:39:00]  Uh-huh.  What's wrong?  How good could I be?  This is disgusting.  I just watched a homeless man's shit rubbed under someone's nose.  Fucking Pat Duffy.  He had an invisible mustache.  Like, dude, there's nothing under your nose.  So he just kept digging in until something appeared.  Line of the day brought to you by AshleyMadison.com.

I'm going to get the implants.  All right.  And then he comments on all of them.  I know.  You feed him down again.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.

Tom, now you got to...  All right, I'm calming down.  All right, Keith, you got to make sure...  Okay, but...  All right, I'll calm down.  But can you rub my balls?  That's number four, right? 
[03:41:00]  Two to go.  Right to the next one.  That's a good deal.  You got 40.  You only got 40.  You're going to walk out with $140.  You're going to walk out with 140 bucks in all these beers.  You're going to lose.  Well, that's...  No!  I can rub his balls.  And that's what I got to do.  And so I got serious work ahead of me.  He's still just battling.  Why'd they cut that line?  How big is his ball?  I don't know.  The line was...  You should have thought of that 20 years ago. 
[03:41:30]  20 years ago?  The last runner-up line of the day.  Hey, Tippi, you were looking at our poster outside the studio.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  That doesn't sound good at all.  You all right, Tippi?  What's the matter?  No, I'm dying.  I'll be dead.  No, I'm not being dead.  All right, Tom is still over there.  And finally, thanks to AshleyMadison.com. 
[03:42:00]  This is it, right?  Line of the day.  Here.  Here comes.  Light of the day.  Light of the day.  Light of the day.  Stop.  Iraq, you've never disappointed us.  Could you just get on your knees?  Yeah, get on your knees.  I need a blowjob.  Wait a minute, Tippi, Tom.  Well. 
[03:42:30]  You've got to make an appointment.  You've got to have a blowjob ahead of year.  But you've got to wait your time.  All right, listen.  We did a lot here today.  Too much.  It smells so bad in here.  Pat Duffy audio is...  Well, I like smelly cock anyway.  Once again, really fast.  Here's audio.  I want your bow.  Hold on, Tom. 
[03:43:00]  Here's audio of Pat Duffy.  Here's Pat Duffy.  Hi.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  You have nothing on your face, though.  Make a doo-doo mustache, you.  You've got to make a doo-doo mustache.  Oh, fuck.  No way.  No way.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 
[03:43:30]  Oh, shit.  We're above radio.  Can I get hired for this?  Try heaming.  Yeah, he still doesn't get paid.  He's try heaming. 
[03:44:00]  He's trying heaming.  He's trying to put his fingers to the floor.  I can't win this guy.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Amazing.  Pat Duffy.  Wow.  I can't wait to show that video at the ONA Animation Festival.  Oh, that one will get moans and groans.  That will be a crowd pleaser. 
[03:44:30]  Tippi, thank you.  You want to just take a nap?  No, I'm taking a nap.  I'm saying you guys suck.  Leave him in here for the Ron and Fez show.  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.  You want to take a nap until Ron and Fez?  No, I need a can opener.  He ain't got one.  Can opener.  A bottle opener and he ain't got one.  Use your underwear.  Hey, Will.  Where's Will?  I need that, too.  Hey, Will.  Will, what beer is Tippi Tom drinking today?  I'm drinking Budweiser.  It's all right to say Budweiser? 
[03:45:00]  All right.  Budweiser.  Tippi Tom has been enjoying the fine beverage known as Budweiser.  Hold on.  Hey, buddy, you got to open it?  Yeah.  Steve.  Steve.  This bums to you.  This is Puerto Rican over here.  Can you help me out?  He just called Steve a Puerto Rican.  I can't open the beer.  Yeah, Puerto Rican.  Did he call you a Puerto Rican, Steve?  No, you're the one.  I can't open it.  Oh, Jesus.  You stink.  You're really awful. 
[03:45:30]  Ow, ow, ow, ow.  Fuck.  Oh, no.  That's what I wanted.  Let me see what happens.  Yeah, all right.  He know how to open it.  But he's a big, strong arm, unlike me.  Don't touch me.  He's a strong man.  All right.  We're officially going to end the show, A and I.  But we're just going to leave the mic on and listen to the ramblings of Tippi Tom.  Enjoy.  No.  It could be for a minute. 
[03:46:00]  It could be for an hour.  I don't know.  We don't know.  We'll just see what happens.  Tom, the stage is yours.  You talk about whatever you want.  Go ahead.  Just talk.  See you tomorrow.  I was having somebody help me out right now.  I asked for a very simple act, and this man, who don't even know me, come over and said, 
[03:46:30]  here, I'll do it, and that's what he did, and so that, I treasure that kind of treasure,  because the little things mean so much.  They add up the big things.  You want big stuff in your life.  I don't want big stuff.  I'm all for little stuff. 
[03:47:00]  But I get big stuff, because I guess I'm luckier than other people, but I give away, and so  that's what Tippi Tom do.  Death.  Most of the handicapped children with polio and stuff like that, and retarded children 
[03:47:30]  that, you know, they can't help themselves.  So when I make extra money, I give the money away.  I don't need that much money, and I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't need it, you know.  I mean, and, you know, what am I going to do?  Be a prince somewhere in a top tower somewhere? 
[03:48:00]  I've been there.  I don't need to go there.  I don't want to go there anyway.  I don't want to be with people that need something, and I feel special.  I feel like I'm worthy of something, and that's what I do.  I feel sorry for people, but maybe I do, but maybe I don't actually. 
[03:48:30]  But, like, I was crippled most of my life. 
[03:49:00]  I, I, I, I, now I walk like a person.  Hmm.  If I think I'm all right right now, you got to see me walk.  You need to see what happens to me.  I can walk halfway down the block.  My legs turn over and blah, blah, blah, nobody care.  Well, that's okay.  I don't expect them to care. 
[03:49:30]  Just leave me alone.  Yeah, that's it.  A cop locked me up last week.  Oh. 
[03:50:00]  What is that?  Where?  Where?  There's nothing.  I don't know where's.  But where I go to?  Here?  Right here?  Mm-hmm.  Say that.  You don't want me to sign it?  Just read it.
