<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of a news story about "Mr. Jew," a masseuse at Maximus Day Spa on Long Island accused of sexual assault.  The hosts, along with Jim Norton, reacted to the story with crude humor and sexual innuendo, playing news reports and taking calls from listeners who had frequented the spa, including a call from one of the host's mothers, fueling speculation.  They then transitioned to a satirical segment about a Titanic-themed inflatable slide at a children's party, leading to a brainstorming session of similarly tasteless carnival attractions based on various tragedies.  This was followed by a segment featuring a Fox News report criticizing the show and highlighting contradictions in producer Rick Delgadoâ€™s statements. Anthony's mother's drunken singing performance was also played.

The show continued with a discussion of their own success, audience, and relationship with Howard Stern, recounting an anecdote about a frustrating experience with a network that repeatedly used their interview segments out of context during Yankees games. They addressed criticisms of sexism and racism, dismissing them.  A significant portion involved a prank on comedian Richard Jeni, who was kept waiting outside the studio before a tense interaction.  Sandy Kane, a frequent caller, then appeared in provocative clothing, performing a song about Jerry Seinfeld, resulting in interruptions and objects being thrown by the hosts.  Throughout this section,  "Ben," "Norton," "Rick," Otto, George, and Tommy were referenced in the conversation.

Next, the broadcast descended into a chaotic mix.  The hosts playfully referenced Jerry Seinfeld before shifting to a discussion of Sandy Kane, who recounted her experiences in comedy clubs and stripping, performing another crude and sexually suggestive song.  Otto and George, a comedian and his puppet, joined, engaging in offensive racial slurs, insults towards "Man Cow," and crude jokes. Otto then performed a profane and sexually explicit Paula Poundstone impression. Sandy Kane returned, revealing and discussing a genital growth with the hosts and Otto/George, leading to further vulgar conversation and sexually explicit humor.  Opie then recounted a night in a dilapidated "crack hotel," detailing unsanitary conditions and his efforts to avoid contracting STDs.

The show then featured a "Bra Bingo" game, with callers Jamie, Corey (38C), Annette (38D), Heather (36B), Skylar (38B), Margaret (36A), and Shannon (32A) providing their bra sizes, prompting sexually charged comments from Opie, Anthony, and Ben.  The segment concluded with comedian Stephen Lynch performing a sexually suggestive song about his work as a gynecologist,  featuring terms like "pudenda," "groping," and "balloon," with the hosts expressing concern about potential censorship.  A "What's in My Pants?" segment, revealed to be a prank call simulating pubic hair texture, ended the broadcast.  Throughout the entire broadcast, profanity, offensive jokes, and sexually explicit language were pervasive.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie, I'm the dick.  Anthony, I'm an ass.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Why are you wasting your time with this sleazy trash?  People are starting to say funniest radio ever, so don't wreck it. 
[00:00:30]  All right, where's that Fox story?  We've got to get into the massage parlor.  Which one is this?  This is the massage parlor thing that we didn't get to yesterday.  Well, it's a little day spa, one out on Long Island, Maximus Day Spa, out there on Long Island.  It seems there was this masseuse there who took some liberties with some of the girls that came in to get massages, some of the ladies.  Right.  He would digitally manipulate.  There were two fingers involved. 
[00:01:00]  Right.  You could say that, right?  And some oil.  And some oil.  He'd use a little oil like they do when they're looping up your thighs maybe and massaging you.  He wouldn't stop it.  No.  No.  And this is a high-end place.  We have sent people we know and love to this place.  Well, hundreds of guys for Mother's Day and Valentine's Day sent their ladies' certificates to this place.  Look at Rick.  What did you do?  On our wedding day, I sent Linda there with, like, her whole wedding party? 
[00:01:30]  All the bridesmaids.  Wow.  A smorgasbord for that guy.  And she got, like, the full, you know, wedding package.  I don't even know what that includes.  Wow.  All those laid out.  You're probably playing all those girls like a piano.  Yeah.  Nice.  We have sent a lot of people to high-end places.  This type of thing, you know, it doesn't go on at a high-end place, obviously.  And this woman came forward, and now a lot of women are coming forward.  Yeah.  Because there's one massage guy, Mr. Jew. 
[00:02:00]  Mr. Jew.  He's an Asian guy, and his name is Mr. Jew.  Swear to God.  What's his first name?  Yang Chang.  Mr.  Kang Chang.  Something.  Jew.  Jew.  Right.  So, you want to play the little tape?  Yeah, let's see what the news did with this story.  See, I sent Sandy there.  She's gotten back many times.  Uh-oh.  Now I think I understand. 
[00:02:30]  I sent my mom there.  That's why we need to get your mom on the phone.  She went there for a whole nice day of pampering.  And your mom.  Who knows if she was digitally manipulated.  She might have been digitally manipulated by the Jew.  By Jew.  Mr. Jew.  Mr. Jew.  I hope she calls.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, here's the story.  We'll stop it as we go here.  All right.  Now to the sexual secrets behind the closed doors of a spa.  A woman believes she is the victim of sex abuse, said one of them.  And others are stepping forward. 
[00:03:00]  Linda Schmidt has the story.  She's in Westbury, Long Island right now.  Linda.  That's right.  They're John and Rosanna.  Well, what started out as a day of relaxation quickly turned into a day of horror for at least  one woman from Long Island.  Now, she has told her story to Fox 5 News, and we have concealed her identity.  I said to myself, this is a well-known place.  He has to be a professional.  This Long Island woman was looking forward to her massage in Day of Beauty in June at the Maximus Day Spa in Westbury.  Her husband had given her a gift certificate for their anniversary. 
[00:03:30]  But during the massage, she says masseur Kyung Joo sexually assaulted her.  He was trying to pull my leg out, and I was very tense.  And I'm laying there with my eyes closed.  And all I remember is him going and getting the oils.  And then all of a sudden, he was in my lower private area.  And I just jumped.  Yeah.  I just jumped.  Sweet, merciful crap!  Like, I was very surprised. 
[00:04:00]  And I froze.  In shock, she says she got dressed and immediately told a female employee.  I proceeded to tell her crying what happened.  And she just hugged me and said, it's not right.  It's not your fault.  It's not your fault.  She knew exactly how I felt.  As it turns out, Mr. Jew is not licensed as a masseur in New York.  Mr. Jew.  All right, I recognize the voice.  That's my mom.  Yeah.  That's why she won't go.  The woman is now suing him and Maximus Spa for $31 million. 
[00:04:30]  The purpose of this lawsuit is really designed to send a message to places like Maximus and other spas  that this kind of improper behavior will not be tolerated.  I got to defend that place, though.  Why?  It's a high-end place.  Oh, yeah.  And they didn't know who they were hiring.  It seems like it's just this.  It's like, I got to give a message to this place.  Like, you know, all the masseuses over there are doing this.  Yeah, it seems like it was just this one guy.  And how much are they suing for?  $31 million. 
[00:05:00]  $31 million.  I mean, all right.  You know, he slips a knuckle or two.  Two.  Two.  I mean, yeah, it's horrible.  You know, it's awful.  I'd be, you know, you kick the guy's ass or something.  But $31 million.  I'm thinking, you know, the lady should get, like, a gift certificate for, like, the Outback.  Right.  You get a Bloomin' Onion, maybe a steak.  Right.  Sure.  But $31 million.  $31 million?  I mean, for God's sake, I don't know how many junior high school girls I'd owe money to. 
[00:05:30]  Back in.  What?  I'm talking about the old days.  That's when men and women...  You know, when you're really out of work.  That's where men and women are completely different.  Yeah.  If you're going for a massage at a...  Oh, my God.  Imagine you're a guy.  No.  No.  Hear me out.  And you're, like, at a high-end, legit place.  And there's a lady, you know, massaging you.  And she goes for the privates.  That's what I mean.  You're not even thinking twice.  This is like...  You're pulling out tip money for her.  You're not going to, like, jump up and go, oh, my God, and, you know, complain to anybody. 
[00:06:00]  What are you doing?  Imagine running on.  She touched me.  She violated me.  I was laying there.  She pulled out my leg and touched my airbag.  She touched me where the bathing suit covers.  You're opening your legs.  You're going into your wallet and pulling out tip money.  Come for God's sake.  That was good.  That's where we're completely different. 
[00:06:30]  Happy ending.  Happy ending.  Happy ending.  Happy ending.  Yankee Cranky.  Let's continue.  Since this woman's story became public, two more women have come forward claiming they, too, were improperly touched by the same masseur.  These incidents allegedly happened about two years ago.  Mr. Jew's attorney says his client is innocent and that money motivated the other women to accuse Mr. Jew.  You've got two women 18 months ago and two years ago who never told anyone about this alleged inappropriate behavior by Mr. Jew. 
[00:07:00]  They read an article in the paper.  They see $31 million.  And so far, Mr. Jew is charged with that one incident that allegedly happened back in June.  He is charged with forcible touching, which is a class A misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail.  By the way, the state is also investigating this case.  We're live in Westbury, Long Island.  I'm Linda Schmidt, Fox 5 News.  John and Rosanna, back to you.  Thank you, Linda.  There's the story.  Mr. Jew.  Mr. Jew.  What's happening, Mr. Jew? 
[00:07:30]  Here's a lady on the line that goes to that place quite often.  Katie.  Yep.  What's up?  I have an appointment there once every month.  Every month you go there?  Every month I go there.  To the Westbury one?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I get the water journey and then the hour-long massage.  What do you get?  The what?  The water journey.  Water journey?  My chick had the water journey.  Yeah, it's great.  The water.  What is the water journey?  It's, I don't know.  I never asked.  They put you in some pool, I heard.  Yeah.  Some, like, ridiculous shower with kids coming from all directions, I think. 
[00:08:00]  And then, like, a waterfall falls on your head and you're naked.  Mr. Jew uses his face like a loofah.  Grinding the area, I think it's called.  Did you ever have Mr. Jew at that place?  No.  You know, I'm stupid.  I've always requested a woman because I'm more comfortable than me.  Yeah, see?  I can't tell you how many times that would have been the perfect ending.  You know, the guys, masseuse guys, have to be gay.  You shouldn't allow, you shouldn't have your chick going to a masseuse that isn't gay.  Because for God's sake, the guy's going to be feeling her up all over her body and he's 
[00:08:30]  going to get off on it.  And there's no way you're telling me he's a professional, like a doctor or something.  You're a masseuse, you're a guy, you're massaging women, you're going to be getting  off on touching these girls.  He's not supposed to touch the boobies or the privates, though.  Yeah, but you touch the ass.  Yeah, yeah.  They touch the thighs, the ass, the back.  I mean, there's plenty more sensual areas on a woman's body.  Is that right, Brewer?  You son of a bitch?  I need to touch.  Feel really realistic.  Mr. Jew, you're here. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, take a happy coat, happy coat.  I'm going to take a little rice powder and stick it up.  Feel very good, very good.  Now I grab just a little nipple and I put a little **** on it.  Feel good, feel good.  That's good.  You are right, girl.  What are you doing?  What am I doing?  I do an ancient Chinese tongue massage, which is very relaxing. 
[00:09:30]  I don't know if I should be doing it.  No, no.  Very ancient Chinese secret.  I put my face right there.  Oh, I don't...  Yeah, it feels funny.  I'm a heinie.  That's good.  And then you reek a duck sauce.  Katie.  If Mr. Jew went for this move on you, what would you do?  It depends on what part of the massage.  At the very end, take, you know? 
[00:10:00]  You're kind of feeling into it.  Oh, you're kind of feeling into it at the end of the massage?  Well, it also depends on what Mr. Jew looks like.  But you get the women, so it's kind of hot.  No, you haven't seen the woman that massages me.  What, are they like Helga and stuff?  Yeah.  She's a big girl.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Katie.  That's what's the problem.  Big fat arm.  Give me a massage.  But Brewer, we were saying, like, if we went for a massage at a legitimate place, guys,  right, and there was a woman massaging you and she went for that move, you're not running 
[00:10:30]  and telling the people at the front desk.  No.  I can't think of one guy out there that would run and say, oh, my God, you're touching me  in my dirty area.  You tell your friends.  Yeah.  Pete, maybe you're out of black real quick.  What's going on?  Just meet me.  I'm going to taste them.  Dude, you've got to go to this massage place.  I went in there.  The chick starts feeling up my yam bag.  Get that fat out of here.  Ask for Ingram.  Dude, is she fat?  Ask for Mr. Jew. 
[00:11:00]  No.  Mr. Jew touched me.  Oh, he touched me.  Mr. Jew.  Mr. Jew.  He's a Chinese guy.  Brewer said he has a story, though.  He has a rabbi, Mr. Ching.  This is my first massage ever.  Yeah.  True story.  I was in Colorado.  How old?  Sad to say, like two years ago.  Really?  It's way too gay.  Okay.  It's just way too gay.  I don't need someone touching me like that.  It's just funky. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Well, we go to this guy, and the guy's going to do it.  Ah.  So, I'm instantly like, ah, ah, he's like, ah, it's the best thing ever.  He's married, so it's throwing up when it happens.  But it's man hands.  But you know when someone's married, but you're still just not sure.  You think once in a while, this guy gets drunk, doesn't show off, and then Rick Delgado.  You meet his own friend that's way off in left field.  Rick.  Gets on all four.  Rick.  No, I know he's good at baseball, but, you know, he walks funny.  You know what I mean?  Well, this guy, I go to the room, and I don't know if you're supposed to keep your underwear 
[00:12:00]  or anything like that, and he said, ah, you've got to do it all nude.  What?  The guy that's saying that?  Yeah, but like a dick.  I was like, all right, this is what he's supposed to be.  I don't want to be a dick and not listen, and I'm a dick.  So, I do like having your background.  So, I lay down.  You ever seen a grown man naked?  He doesn't have a sheet on me, and then when I... 
[00:12:30]  Wait, you're laying down, completely naked.  What did this guy talk you into?  So, dude, it gets worse.  I had to stare at it.  Eat it.  I'm so embarrassed.  So, now I go to yourself.  You know, he starts massaging, and he's getting too close to my ass cheek.  Oh, no.  So, I'm instantly like...  Wait a minute.  F you, man.  Did you feel like awkward and crap?  You're laying it on your back completely naked? 
[00:13:00]  You got to walk...  Your back?  First of all, you can't sit...  Are you on your back or on your belly?  No, right now I'm on my belly.  Oh, all right.  So, I'm still...  I'm like, all right.  He starts massaging back.  I'm like, all right.  Okay.  I got it.  I'm secure enough in my masculinity.  I still can't relax.  Of course not.  I got audio of Jim.  I think the second I started...  The second I started getting relaxed, he started, like, doing the legs, and I got a little close  to my ass cheek, and I went...  Cool.  So, I went, listen, um... 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, I don't know if this was cool.  I don't know if I should be...  It's like you're trying out gay sex the first time.  Look, man.  I don't think this is cool anymore.  Look, I tried it.  Keep the money.  Listen, I made a mistake.  I took you an hour out of your time.  The funny part is, you're still trying to be nice about it.  Like, hey, look, man.  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  You don't know.  You feel weird.  What am I going to do?  Just punch him?  What am I doing?  It is.  It's like Jim's telling us his rape story.  Yeah.  So, then...  Here, let me massage you.  Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
[00:14:00]  You know, I felt the gun, so I knew he was armed, and I just figured I had to.  It's the worst, because you got this faggy music.  It's like, wing, wing, wing, wing, wing, wing, wing, wing, wing, wing, wing, wing, wing.  Water journey, Jim?  Water journey?  Bang.  Bang.  So, this is where it got really bad.  Uh-oh.  It gets worse?  He talks to me.  He's like, listen, listen, listen.  No, no, no.  Oh, he talks in.  He talks in.  And I go back.  Give me a D.  Give me.  Give me an I.  I. 
[00:14:30]  Give me a C.  C.  What do you got?  What do you got?  Me.  Nice head dick.  So I get talked back into, all right, I should relax, Mova.  But did you get up at any point?  Yeah, this is when I got up.  And he's like, no, no, listen, man.  Wait, now you get up and you're naked?  You're naked.  Yeah, and I grab my shirt.  All right, you grab your shirt to cover up.  Wait a minute.  Oh, my God, I'm having a hard flashback.  Now that I think about it, I gave him a hummus.  Holy Christ. 
[00:15:00]  What happened?  Oh, man.  See, the joke's on him because I'm not gay.  But first of all, I was at a bed and breakfast.  So it's in the dude's house.  Oh, no.  And now that I remember, I'm in this dude's bedroom.  You know, as soon as I woke up, I'm like, oh, the bedroom?  I took out an hummus.  I've already given the cash.  Were you on his bed?  No, no, no.  Oh, that would be homo. 
[00:15:30]  But it was right next.  It was easily influenced by how he went to lay on the bed.  Right.  And I got audio of Brewers.  Oh, yeah?  Massage therapist.  Oh, here we go.  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it.  Crawl around like a dog.  Did you ever play, Doggy?  That's when I sniff her and she just growls.  It's my father.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  So it's in the guy's house.  Why did you go on some kind of a wacky bed and breakfast vacation? 
[00:16:00]  Me and my wife were like, let's just go to Colorado.  But don't you like getting up and scratching yourself and being able to walk naked to the  fridge or something?  All right, hold on.  Yeah.  Hold on.  I'm starting to breathe again.  I haven't laughed that hard since the last time Brewers was in.  Okay.  True story.  I feel like a dick, buddy.  I want to help all fellow male guys going for massages.  I lost something in the translation, though.  So you're naked trying to leave. 
[00:16:30]  You're trying to lay still and this guy's...  No, but you were up and you were leaving as you're naked, getting your clothes, and then  he talked you back into...  He talked me back into...  That's smooth, man.  Listen, you just never have...  I said, no, man, I didn't think it was like this.  And he went, oh, no, it's cool.  It's like a...  You know, this is a massage.  But I tell you what, I'll do your wife first.  Oh, man.  This guy says, I'll do the wife first.  And I'm like, well...  She was the appetizer.  I don't know.  He's like, trust me.  And now you know if he's touching your ass like that, he's going to be all over your wife's 
[00:17:00]  ass.  Exactly.  Because he's bi.  We don't need...  See?  He don't care what it is as long as it's flesh under his hands.  So, like a dick, I find like, all right, maybe, maybe I'm overreacting.  Maybe.  Maybe.  My instinct is going, get out!  Dick!  How many times do I have to tell you?  Here's God.  Right to Brewer.  Brewer, man, touch your ass.  Door, two feet away.  Goodbye!  Goodbye!  And I got the evil other side going, oh, it's just a massage, Jim. 
[00:17:30]  You're overreacting.  Faggot.  Faggot.  Got ourselves a pretty little faggot.  Your balls are showing.  So now, all right, you were up, he talked you back into it, now you lay back down on  your belly.  I lay back on my belly.  It's funny now, I'm talking about it, but I'm like, dang, this is horrible. 
[00:18:00]  That's awful.  I'm going to sue this guy, man.  Yeah.  You should.  Was it Mr. Jew?  I go back down, I'm laying belly down.  Yeah.  Starts again, and he goes, oh, man, dude, he's doing my feet.  Oh.  Whatever, whatever.  He's doing the feet.  He told me to turn off.  Get out of here!  Stop it!  You're laying there, you're buck naked on your belly, and then he goes, that's a winner! 
[00:18:30]  When does he tell you?  Talk about one of the most humiliating times as you, as a man, turn around to another guy,  going, all right, turn around, and you're like, this guy wants to see my...  Wait a minute.  This guy's going to see my donkey.  Yeah, hold on.  This guy's going to see my donkey.  Yeah, there you go.  Turn around, there it is.  Wait, you did it?  How's that for a topper?  Oh, hey, Zimbrower. 
[00:19:00]  Turn over now.  I'm going to do a sit-on-you massage, it's called.  So...  You did it?  I turn around, and then I grab my shirt, and he goes, um, what are you doing?  What?  And I went, you know what?  You had a date, man.  This is...  Yeah.  Yeah, it's like a date that's going wrong.  This is not cool.  Right.  I go, listen, I'm sorry, I just can't.  I go down.  Now it's like, me and my wife are stuck in this house. 
[00:19:30]  For how long?  You're going to be like, we're in the middle of vacation time.  We can't get anywhere.  We're like hundreds of miles of the next cabin.  We're in the middle of the...  And you're with the guy that was rubbing your ass and wanted to see your donkey.  And he's like, don't forget, in the morning we have French toast with strawberries, and  Donna's going to go pick out raspberries for us, and, uh...  Dude, what a faggot vacation.  Come on.  I've done the, uh, the, uh, what is it called?  The, uh...  The bed and breakfast?  Yeah, I've done the bed and breakfast.  They're cool.  I don't know.  I didn't get the free massage.  I don't want to live with someone on my vacation. 
[00:20:00]  I want to go to a hotel.  I want to be alone with my chicks in a room.  Period.  Well, you learn.  I want to be able to wake.  I want to be able to slam heads against the headboard.  I want to be able to wake up after you're done, walk into the bathroom, take care of  whatever you got to do, pop the minibar open.  I don't want to deal with Mrs. Kravitz coming downstairs, seeing me bent over the fridge  looking at my brown eyes.  You know what I mean?  No, I know.  There are some normal bed and breakfast places out there.  Jim went to a bathhouse. 
[00:20:30]  Plato's Retreat.  All right, we have to take a break.  All right, man.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Phone numbers for New York, 877-692-1027. 
[00:21:00]  For everyone else listening to us, you want to get a hold of the show, 866-277-4.  Wow.  All right, so the Titanic ride, Anthony?  Yeah.  Now, you finally saw this.  We had talked about this beforehand.  And I can't believe this is not an outcry.  We saw the website and everything, and I think there was a little article in the paper.  I have to tell you, when we were discussing this about a month ago, or even longer, I thought  it was kind of a good...  No, no, it's got carnivals and bears. 
[00:21:30]  I'm driving home.  I'm outside Huntington.  And somebody was throwing a kid's party.  And they had the Titanic slide set up, and kids were sliding down it.  It's this big inflatable slide, and it's shaped like the Titanic, but it's only a half of  it, because it's tipped up, the stern way up in the air, way up in the air, and it looks  like it's sinking into the ground.  That's right, Anthony. 
[00:22:00]  And the kids climb up a little ladder, and then you're able to slide down the decks of  the Titanic, just like the horrified, real-life human beings sliding to their death in the  icy waters of the North Atlantic, bouncing off of the stacks, and when they get down,  they go, I want to go again.  Right.  And they climb back up and slide down.  Here is something.  I saw a couple kids bouncing off the smokestacks.  Bouncing off the smokestacks.  This is something that really happened. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, it was a long time ago.  But thousands of people died in a horrible, horrible way, and now it has just come down  to, if enough time goes by, not only can you joke about it, not only can you talk about  it without having to be all somber, but you can now make a carnival ride out of it.  Right.  Look as the little children climb up to the slanted deck of the Titanic and slide down with smiles  on their face, not unlike the real passengers with big smiles on their, oh, wait, no, those 
[00:23:00]  were screams of horror.  But instead of getting done with the slide and going and maybe getting some ice cream,  they will just freeze in the icy cold waters of the North Atlantic.  This song I dedicate to the survivors of the Titanic and to all the little children, like the  one I was finally able to get with my impotent husband, Rene. 
[00:23:30]  We froze some sperm.  So when they had to cut off his cancerous testicles and prostate, I was still able to impregnate  myself with Rene's frozen sperm, the frozen sperm bouncing into my egg, much like the Titanic 
[00:24:00]  bounced into that iceberg on that dark night in April of whatever effing year that was.  And the people sinking slowly into the icy waters, much like Rene's frozen sperm slammed  into my ice cold eggs.  The doctor who did the artificial insemination needed a extra long turkey baster to get past 
[00:24:30]  my huge camel toe that you see live in concert when I wear my jumpsuits.  Doesn't my camel toe look like the bow of the Titanic slammed into my icy vatch?  I think so.  But it all comes down, when you add some years, it can be made into a carnival ride.  This goes to the many women that lost their lives on the Titanic, and mostly it is dedicated 
[00:25:00]  to the survivors.  I am Sam Feer, master of the pan flute.  I am Sam Feer, master of the pan flute.  Try the TWA Flight 800 Flume Plunge, where we light the children on fire and send them plunging 
[00:25:30]  to their deaths.  Also, the Hiroshima fun house.  Is that really my shadow, or that of a Jap burnt on a building?  What is it?  I don't know.  I don't know.  But disasters can be fun, just like the Titanic.  Make sure you join us for Columbine Paintball.  It's great.  You run into a high school that looks just like Columbine.  Two people with trench coats chase you with paintball guns. 
[00:26:00]  It's so much fun.  Hey, I'm good.  Hitler's Haunted Bunker.  Laugh along, both Gentile and Jew, as you go through Hitler's Haunted Bunker.  Why?  Enough time passed for the Titanic.  Where's the line?  See, I'm making a point here. 
[00:26:30]  There are plenty of disasters.  Raid makes a great point on Line 8.  Raid, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Your kid slid down the Titanic slide.  Yeah, last year at the Sussex County Fair, my son went down that.  And the funny thing is, before he gets on, they're like,  hey, you can't come on here with your sneakers on.  You've got to take your shoes off. 
[00:27:00]  I'm like, this isn't in bad enough taste as it is,  but the kid's got to take his shoes off to pretend he's dying on the Titanic.  That's great.  Do they have old people to trample over and push out of the way?  Like they did to the lifeboats.  They should have, like, higher old people on the deck of the Titanic  to push out of the way.  Squirt them with a hose till the old bastards drown  in the icy waters of the North Atlantic.  I wonder if they hose down the kids with really, really cold water 
[00:27:30]  before they slide down.  Hose them down.  Oh, God.  That is awful.  That's great.  We also have little games for them to play at the carnival.  We have Jean Benet Ramsey whack-a-mole  where you beat her over the head  with a replica of her father's junk. 
[00:28:00]  Larry, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  And enjoy the food.  It's the Donner Party Buffet.  $4.99 a person.  What about the Shondra Levy hide-and-seek case?  Now that is truly in bad taste.  Oh, yeah.  Not enough time has passed by.  See, I'm not learning.  The fun part, she never gets to yell,  Ali Ali Oxenfree.  Because she's dead.  Larry. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I came by a fireman's picnic the other day  coming back from the store,  and I saw this thing,  and I saw this ship,  and I said,  what is that thing?  And my wife says,  I don't know.  It looks like a ship.  And I thought it was cast a plane.  But when I drove by it,  I said,  oh, that's a Titanic.  That's a Titanic ride.  For the love of God.  And if the kids are too young  to play on the Titanic ride,  remember,  you can go in the William Shatner kiddie pool.  Bill Shatner will stand as lifeguard 
[00:29:00]  and do nothing as you drown.  Oh, my God.  Allegedly.  Look at the poor little bastard  struggling for his life.  I'll just stand there  and call the cops in about 0 and 0.  Anthony, what's going on?  Anthony.  Oh, this guy's got a great line.  Anthony.  Yes.  Go.  I want to know  if they close the gates  to all the poor kids  and let the rich kids go first. 
[00:29:30]  They lock him up in the bilge.  You look in the lower portion  of the Titanic ride.  There's poor people down there  covered in coal dust.  Sean, what's going on?  Yeah, how you doing?  Good.  Listen, you forgot about  the Susan Smith car flume  which goes into the water  with the kids in it.  Oh, God.  Hey, why not?  Now people are going to be like,  now that's outrageous.  But how much time has to pass  before it's in good taste?  Well, it actually reminds me  of another game  that I thought was really fun. 
[00:30:00]  It's the Oklahoma City bombing game.  And if you win the game,  you're carried away  by a crying fireman.  It's awful.  But I mean,  why is the Titanic any different?  Why the hell  can they make a ride out of it  just because enough time went by  that you make a ride?  Could you imagine  a Flight 800 flume?  Come on.  Today's lunch special,  Sharon Tater tots.  Yes, the Manson experience. 
[00:30:30]  Where the little kids  get the clown  like Charles Manson  to paint their faces up  with little swastikas  on their head.  Bob writes,  I can't wait for the  Puerto Rican Day Parade  lawn sprinkler game.  Those aren't water weenies.  Let's go to Greg.  Greg, you're next  on the O.P. and Anthony show.  O.N.A., what's up?  Hey, man.  Congratulations on syndication.  Oh, yeah, that's happening.  Thanks.  Yeah, don't forget  the Paula Poundstone  slumber party. 
[00:31:00]  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  See, well, that's too new.  That's horrible  that you said that.  Much too new.  There's also  the new Navigator game  where they cover you  in banana juice  and allow four baboons  to attack you  in the Navigator.  Oh, wow.  That happened yesterday.  That's awful.  Oh, you've got to  get a copper aid on it  quick before you jump on it.  Oh, man.  Oh, oh.  Well, you've got the point. 
[00:31:30]  Phew.  And, of course,  yes, the Ted Kennedy  log flume.  You go with your girl,  but only you come out.  And you can win  a JFK Jr. QP doll.  Oh, wait,  they really have that.  Did you see this?  In the post, yeah.  JFK Jr.,  little Kewpie doll.  The Danbury men  putting it out.  It's little JFK Jr.  saluting  like he did  at his dad's funeral.  He looks like  one of the Beatles  in that, doesn't he?  A gold range. 
[00:32:00]  A gold range.  A gold range.  A gold range.  You know what  I want, Anthony?  He's a Rockaway  beach wave pool.  Oh, God.  That was awesome.  That's still on the cover  of the New York paper.  That's why I'm here, baby.  That's horrible.  It's tragic.  Three girls  drowned in Rockaway Beach.  It's just a ride.  My God.  You know,  the lifeguards  are sleeping.  I don't know what happened.  That is awful  because that's too new.  You have to wait  maybe 80 years from now. 
[00:32:30]  They make a ride out  because that seems  to be what happens.  There's some great ideas  for kid games  on the phones.  We might have to go  right to the phones  after break here.  Join us at the  Phil Hartman  Shooting Gallery.  Oh, no.  Ding, ding.  Ow, that hurt.  Hey.  I wish I knew her name,  the Houston Mother  Dunk Tank.  God, I can't remember  the name.  Oh, no.  Five kids in a tub.  You might remember me  when I was alive. 
[00:33:00]  Oh.  Sorry, Jay.  It's close to home,  doesn't it?  Okay.  I still feel bad  about Rockaway  Wave.  Well, you should.  Those are someone's kids  and I just said that.  That person could be  listening.  We're making a point here.  There was a point  to be made.  The Titanic ride  is no different  than any of these  other tragedies.  It's inappropriate.  Thank you, Jay.  All right.  We better take a break.  There you go.  And we'll be back  with the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie.  Anthony. 
[00:33:30]  107.  WNEW.  Well, we got  Brother Joe in here.  He wants to do  a George Harrison song.  We also have  tape of Anthony's mom  drunk singing.  Oh, this?  Anthony, I heard  a little of it. 
[00:34:00]  Did you?  It sounded like  the woman they arrest  on cops  that's drunk  and on PCP  and the kids  are just running around  in nasty diapers.  What happened?  And when they put her  in their holding tank,  she just loses her mind  and starts singing.  I don't care.  That's what it sounds like.  Let Joe give a lead up  to this.  How did this happen?  Brother Joe.  It was my birthday  on Friday  and we ended up  going down to...  Thank you.  We ended up  going out to  eat dinner  and had a couple  of pitchers  of margaritas.  Oh, great. 
[00:34:30]  My family  can drink.  Oh, yeah.  Big fun.  And my mother  kept on saying,  my mom kept on saying  to Dawn  about how good  Joe makes her sound  in the studio.  In the song parodies  and singing,  yeah, Dawn got a good...  But Dawn's got  a good voice.  Yeah, but mom  doesn't understand that.  She thinks it's magic.  It's studio magic.  Like Milli Vanilli  or something.  Right, exactly.  Right, okay.  And she said,  I bet I can sing  just as good as Dawn.  I said,  Ma, come on down 
[00:35:00]  to the studio.  Tape's rolling  and all Joe's thinking  is,  oh, this will be  on the show.  Oh, yeah.  Not only in New York,  now in eight other cities.  Oh, my God.  She can't even travel  without being ridiculed.  So, mom's singing songs  in the studio.  One in particular, yes.  What song  did she choose to sing?  Well, she tried  singing a Carole King song,  I Feel the Earth Move,  but that was just  a little too good,  believe it or not.  So, I saved the tape  for Mercedes-Benz.  Oh, no. 
[00:35:30]  She tried.  Which is a lot  of like acapella.  Oh, it is.  It's all acapella.  She tried singing  Mercedes-Benz.  Yeah, it's a trip.  You're out of the will.  It was a lot of fun.  I've been out of the will  for years.  All right, Melissa.  So, we'll buckle in,  strap in for this one.  It's mine and Joe's mom.  Yeah.  You're singing.  Anthony, your family  can drink  and my family  can Prozac.  Let her get together  and have a party.  This actually sounds  like one of like  Janis Joplin's  showing up 
[00:36:00]  really drunk outtakes.  Oh, really?  Like when she was  drunk before she  killed herself?  I listened to a little  of it and your mom  hits a couple notes  and she's totally  committed to it.  Right.  Oh, really?  She is cutting an album  for the free world.  This is a hit  and she knows it.  All right, here's  Phil Spector's  winking at her  the whole time.  Here's Anthony's mom  singing.  Let's get this.  Rock on, baby.  What's her name?  Some Joplin.  Rosemary.  Rosemary, rock and roll, baby.  All you have to do  is sing.  I can do it in one take.  Okay.  Sounds like Sandy Cain.  I'll let it sound  in two notes. 
[00:36:30]  Okay, put on the headphones.  Okay, I need you.  Use my headphones.  What the f***?  Where's your cans?  Cans?  I don't have those.  Cans.  Oh, God.  Could I do it  like in one take?  Feedback, everything.  I don't know,  but I was getting  like feedback  right in my ear.  Okay, I want to do  I have to make  my voice grab.  I could do this. 
[00:37:00]  If I, Joseph,  if it takes me  more than once  to do it,  but I want to do it,  I want you to like  save it for posterity.  She's having.  I got to stop the tape.  Your mom has  the hottest voice.  Oh, God.  She really does.  Stop it.  She has a really  hot voice.  Jim, help me out.  Very.  The only thing is  that she wants  to do it in one take.  It keeps reminding me  of Ed Wood,  but she is very sexy.  One take.  That's perfect.  Perfect.  Print it.  But the voice  is very hot.  It's all great. 
[00:37:30]  Sexy voice.  It's called drunk.  There we go.  Anthony's mom.  The whole basement  is here.  Do I have a fever?  Are you kidding me?  Say check.  Say check into the mic.  Check.  This is my hell  on holidays.  It sounds like  the whole basement  and the whole upstairs  and probably three stories  high could hear you.  Here we go.  One, two, three.  Lord,  won't you buy me  a Mercedes Benz? 
[00:38:00]  My friends  all drive courses.  I'm a snake  and then  work hard  on my life  with no help  from my friends.  Oh, Lord,  won't you buy me  a Mercedes Benz?  Lord,  won't you buy me  a color TV?  Shut up!  Shut up!  Dollars  is waiting  for me. 
[00:38:30]  Quiet.  God!  Oh,  f**k me!  Oh,  Lord!  Oh,  my mother!  I forgot the word!  Shut up!  Can't stop!  Oh,  Lord,  won't you buy me  a  on the town?  Donnie,  donnie,  donnie,  donnie,  donnie,  donnie,  donnie,  donnie.  Stand up!  I'm a man  on high  the next round.  Quiet.  Oh, Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz? 
[00:39:00]  My friends on dry Porsches, I must make amends.  Work hard for my life with no help from my friends.  Oh, Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz? 
[00:39:30]  That's it.  I forgot the f***ing words.  I like what they did.  I like it.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Holy smoke.  Excuse me, but I do believe that sucks ass.  Dolphins are beaching themselves.  Oh, my God.  Balfalfa Schweitzer singing Janis Joplin.  Dolphins are beaching themselves in Coney Island.  I'm a crooner, Spank. 
[00:40:00]  Barber of Seville.  Figaro.  Tommy, what's up?  Come on, guys.  There you go.  Yo, first of all, it's an honor to be talking to such comic genius, but, uh, Ant, I didn't  know your mom had a cable access show in Manhattan over the weekend.  Oh.  She sounded like Sandy came.  Uh, Mike, what's going on?  Yeah, guys, I gotta tell you, Ant, your mom sounds pretty hot, but once you start singing  it, Jesus Christ, my chubby crawled inward.  Horrible.  Hey, Chet, what's up? 
[00:40:30]  What's up, Ant?  I want to cast my vote for your mom in the MILF contest.  It was late.  I won her, buddy.  Yeah.  Holy Jesus.  That was awful.  People saying, uh, my mom and Lisa from sales should make a duet.  Oh.  Jason, what's up?  What's happening, guys?  Yo, I want to know, could somebody go check out Janis Joplin's grave?  I think the rotten corpse is crawling out to go strangle your mother for that vindition  there, Ant.  That was Janis from the grave.  Dan from Hoboken checking in. 
[00:41:00]  Dan from Hoboken.  I guess Joe, Ant, and Dawn got their musical talent from their father.  We told you she was going for it, man.  Is that the new Fred Flintstone voice?  Gotta give her the credit.  I thought she'd call in by now.  Stop my dog's howling.  Oh, that's funny.  Wow.  That's funny.  I just admire her moxie, man.  She went at it.  Oh, she's got moxie.  She wanted to put Dawn on the canvas, man.  That sounds like.  She rented a mat ready to roll.  You know.  Eli saying, uh, your mom sounds like Joan Rivers on crack. 
[00:41:30]  Oh!  Now I want to hear the song that she sang real well.  After hearing that spectacle.  Knock on Wood, I want to hear now.  Janis Joplin checking in.  I'm finally glad to be dead.  You have your mom's Knock on Wood tape still?  Now I want to hear her singing it good.  I should definitely win the MILF contest.  God, that was awful.  I liked it.  And I know Joe's just like, Joe's looking at it the same way, uh, the guy that filmed  Jimmy the Greek was watching Jimmy the Greek as he was saying all those things. 
[00:42:00]  Just keep going.  Keep going.  No, I got it on tape.  It's going to be great.  Like the guy filming the Hindenburg.  Don't drop the camera.  The Hindenburg guy.  Jason.  Yeah.  Hey, go.  I got two questions.  Anthony, what's your mother's liquor of choice?  How many packs does she smoke a day?  Actually, she doesn't smoke.  All right.  But, uh, she likes champagne.  Wine.  Uh, wine.  And, um, if you really put her over the top, you just give her a white Russian.  She sounds like one classy lady.  You should be proud.  Nice.  A white Russian.  Tell them Large Marge sent ya. 
[00:42:30]  Take care, guys.  Uh, we're having fun, but I do have to say it.  Aunt's Mom is a very classy girl.  She loves going out.  The woman's, uh, what, 62?  Yeah.  And she, uh, loves to party.  Someone you would love to hang with.  Mercedes-Benz stock has mysteriously just plummeted.  Oh, my God.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The last one.  James from Flushing.  Sorry, Aunt, but your mom's singing.  Sounds like a burn victim rolling around in salt.  Ow!  Oh, ha, ha, ha.  Bravo, James. 
[00:43:00]  Thank you, all right.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  All owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNEW.  New York.  Oh, my God.  My God.  My God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, we only got a few minutes left to get people laughing. 
[00:43:30]  Because it's only 20 minutes.  We only got 20 minutes to get people laughing. 
[00:44:00]  As per the man behind this picture, the scene.  No, he's the brains of the operation.  The brains behind the operation.  Rick Delgado, the producer.  The head producer of the Opie and Anthony show.  You saw the Fox News report here in New York last night.  Here he comes.  Everyone just bow.  The head producer is here.  The brains, I believe they said.  Rick, what is this now?  We got, what, 22 minutes?  I mean, 12 minutes.  12 minutes left for the people to start laughing. 
[00:44:30]  Or else what?  They what?  It's not their radio station.  Then turn the station.  It's not.  What is it, Rick?  You win a toaster.  Rick, what was the quote?  What was the quote?  What was the quote, Rick?  What was the blatant contradiction of what I said in just the scene right before that?  Oh, Anthony, I believe I have it right here.  Oh, do you?  When you say Opie and Anthony show, everybody thinks sex, sex, sex.  No.  Listen to the show.  And if you're not laughing within the first 20 minutes, then maybe you've got the wrong station. 
[00:45:00]  Stupid hooker.  Ah, you've got the wrong station.  Uh-uh.  Jim Norton in the studio.  And Norton, holy smoke.  There's Fox News.  You know, give it up for Fox.  They showed a girl squatting right on Norton.  Yeah.  We did not see your face on Fox.  No.  As you shouldn't have.  Here's audio from Norton.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. 
[00:45:30]  I'm going to guess cabbage.  Got to give Fox a lot of credit.  They're showing fat chicks all pixelated.  Barely pixelated.  Yeah.  Just somebody on the message board was saying that.  Oh, my God.  Fox rules.  Big fat tees on the channel.  Big fat tees.  All right.  If you're just tuning in, the 10 o'clock news that aired about 2.40 in the morning last night  because the Yankees and the Phillies did a little feature on us. 
[00:46:00]  About a five or six minute feature on the Opie and Anthony show.  And we have the audio now.  Patricia Wu.  Man, she looked really hot on TV.  She was great.  I didn't even recognize her.  It's like a different woman.  Really?  You didn't think she was hot when she was here?  No, I thought she was hot, but she's even hotter on TV.  Tim, what's going on?  Hey, buddy.  Hey.  Thank you, Opie.  Why?  I'm getting ready to watch the piece last night.  I'm telling my wife about it.  She's telling me how she hates you guys. 
[00:46:30]  You guys come on the TV.  She goes, oh, Opie's so cute.  He's so hot.  I knocked it down three ways last night.  Thank you very much.  All right, Tim.  Thanks.  All right.  Bye.  Equal time.  Chris on line two said I look like a Backstreet Boy.  All right.  You want to play the audio, Ant, finally?  Let's get to it.  I can't wait for Rick's clip in its entirety.  If anyone needs the piece to stop, just raise your hand.  We'll stop it, okay?  That's how we'll play it.  Rick's going to stop it right before his part. 
[00:47:00]  You know, some people call Opie and Anthony vile and obscene.  But people sure are listening.  And John, their hugely popular radio show is not just in New York anymore.  Patricia Wu has more with a behind-the-scenes look.  Patricia.  That's right, Rosanna.  The guys just signed a new contract.  And that means...  No, we haven't.  And Ken's sweating his ass off.  We didn't sign anything. 
[00:47:30]  That's a lie.  Poor Ken.  He's right outside the city.  I know what you're thinking about.  He's got that huge pen.  He's just waiting for us to break again so he can run in with the big pen.  All right.  Contract.  And that means the Opie and Anthony virus is sweeping the country.  New cities are tuning in just about every day.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show for today.  We have Fox News in the studio today, Anthony.  That's right.  Doing a little piece on...  I did say it.  That tool. 
[00:48:00]  That's right.  Fox News.  That's right, Opie.  That's right.  What he said.  The show for today.  We have Fox News in the studio today, Anthony.  That's right.  Doing a little piece on...  That's right, Opie.  On the radio show, in-depth expose on the Opie and Anthony show.  That's right.  We took our cameras behind the scenes to reveal the truth about Opie and Anthony.  What we found will shock you.  Wait a minute.  What?  What we found will shock you. 
[00:48:30]  Three-year-olds hacked up in dumpsters.  That's shocking.  How could you shock her?  She was a sniper in downtown Saigon.  Oh, yes, man.  She was really nice to us.  She really was.  She just looked like the lady who got shot, so I had to say it.  Wasn't that a great clip to...  Oh, phenomenal.  In-depth expose on the Opie and Anthony show.  That's right.  We took our cameras behind the scenes to reveal the truth about Opie and Anthony.  What we found will shock you. 
[00:49:00]  Well, it shocked me.  Oh, yeah!  Wrestling.  Unzipping.  Stripping.  Cat fighting.  It's all in a day's work for Opie and Anthony.  We're going to get the girls in some nice outfits.  Okay.  And the girl that gets her clothes ripped off first loses.  It's no wonder the Opie and Anthony show is tops in its time slot.  The afternoon radio show on WNEW-FM has a huge following, and it's growing.  It's a show you can't just tune in on day one and really get a hang of it. 
[00:49:30]  It's like a soap opera.  You know, after a week, you're like, all right, I know what's going on now.  I kind of got a gist of it.  And it kind of sucks you in.  The man behind the scenes, head producer Rick Delgado, says this show is as funny as it gets.  When you say Opie and Anthony show, everybody thinks sex, sex, sex.  Now, listen to the show, and if you're not laughing within the first 20 minutes, then maybe you've got the wrong station.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Right after I say it might take a little while. 
[00:50:00]  It's going to take a while.  20 minutes.  If you're not laughing in 20 minutes, give me 20 minutes on the clock.  Give me 20 minutes on the clock.  Rick, if you're not hysterical, wet in your pants laughing, then I'll, then, then I gotta, you got the wrong station or something.  We'll even let you laugh on Flex Laugh.  Half your laugh now, half your laugh in 20 minutes. 
[00:50:30]  And a toaster and a rookie card.  Goddamn Rick.  Totally, just blatantly contradicted what I said.  But I said mine first.  But I said it first.  We had a chance to look intelligent, and we just left it all out.  You're a retard now.  You look like idiots.  And you know, guys.  This is a Jam Men Tan program.  Jam Men Tan program, people.  Jam Men Tan.  Jam Men Tan. 
[00:51:00]  You've got to be laughing your ass off in 20 minutes.  20 minutes on the clock.  It's not in 20 minutes.  Start your own radio show.  Get your own equipment.  Do your own goddamn show.  20 minutes.  20 minutes.  That was great. 
[00:51:30]  A bit of advice.  If you have a wow sticker, and nobody wows you within the first 20 minutes, I don't know.  Maybe you're in front of the wrong breast cancer research center.  Oh, God.  Holy cow.  Holy cow.  The first 20 minutes.  That's going to go down in history.  It's one of the best lines on our show.  20 minutes.  Man, Rick.  20 minutes you gave us.  20 minutes.  We don't even wake up until 4.15 on the show.  Jesus, man. 
[00:52:00]  First hour always blows.  We all know that.  20 minutes.  20 minutes.  Damn.  You've got to be laughing.  When you say Opie and Anthony show, everybody thinks sex, sex, sex.  No.  Listen to the show, and if you're not laughing within the first 20 minutes, then maybe you've  got the wrong station.  Shut up, Demi.  Shut up, Demi.  And then he goes, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Shut up, Demi.  That's the best I can come up with right now.  I don't know.  Then it's the wrong station.  You're not laughing in the first 20 minutes. 
[00:52:30]  Well, then, by golly, give it 20 more.  And this is right on the heels of me going, this show is like a soap opera, you know?  There's a few characters.  Oh, you got that clip?  Yeah.  Yeah, this is what's so funny about the piece last night.  Yes.  Rick's quote came right after this quote from Anthony.  It's a show you can't just tune in on day one and really get a hang of it.  It's like a soap opera.  You know, after a week, you're like, all right, I know what's going on now.  I kind of got a gist of it. 
[00:53:00]  And it kind of sucks you in.  All right.  So I'm saying soap opera.  It takes a little while to get a running start going.  Kind of identify with some of the people here on the show.  And that's what I was saying.  And then right after that.  When you say Opie and Anthony show, everybody thinks sex, sex, sex.  No.  Listen to the show.  And if you're not laughing within the first 20 minutes.  20 minutes!  Then...  Then what, Rick?  Then...  What?  Maybe you've got the wrong face.  Totally contradict me, Chuck. 
[00:53:30]  Totally contradict me.  We're a bunch of morons.  Black and white, that contradiction.  We don't know what we want to tell New York.  Lizzie Grubman should have backed any of you for saying that.  Left 20 minutes, Denon, isn't it?  They're pretty much lowering the bar and saying, look, you know, especially for the new cities,  it takes time.  You need to...  It's time.  You need to, you know, hang with the show for a couple of weeks.  A couple of inside jokes that you've got to get to know the personality of the people  to really appreciate the show at its fullest. 
[00:54:00]  But 20 minutes a week, whatever.  Somewhere in there.  Let's leave it open.  20 minutes or like two years.  Just something.  Oh, and the listeners just want to...  Den, den.  Den, they're chomping at the bit to rip Rick apart.  Den.  Someone says we're going to have to...  Ernie-O.  Says, forget, this is legal, isn't it?  Rick's new catchphrase.  Den, maybe you got the wrong face.  I was so proud, too, because it's like, yeah, man, that's a great soundbite, you know? 
[00:54:30]  Oh, I came out of the box.  I was quiet.  Oh, yeah.  You start off great.  And then all of a sudden, it's like, I know what I wanted to say was the word retard,  and you can't say that on TV.  You can say retard.  Then you're a retard.  Sure you can.  You know what's really funny is that Opie and I, we did the interview, so we knew what  we were going to say.  I mean, we remembered doing it, and they'd show a clip, and we're like, okay, I remember  saying this.  Your clip, we never saw.  We weren't in there when you were doing it.  So we had no clue what they asked you or what you said. 
[00:55:00]  So when you pop up on the screen, I'm like, uh-oh.  Oh, no.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  Oh, what's he going to say?  And this is the Beaver Cleaver house.  Looks like a regular house in the front, but that's a facade.  A facade, of course, means false front.  As we go along here, the rest of the Universal Studio tours, my name's Van Max, and I'll be  your guide here at Universal Studios, and I'll throw us the singing anthony.  Ow.  You dick.  Five minutes. 
[00:55:30]  He could have just went back.  They could have re-taped it.  It's not 1907 where it's all live.  I mean, they could have just stopped.  No, they could have cut away when he was thinking, but they decided that...  Oh, let him hang out there and drive.  That uncomfortable pause was a lot of fun to check out, so they kept it in there.  If you're not laughing after 20 minutes, then...  Then I don't know.  Then that thing, then, that you do when you're not laughing.  Then I guess you're not going to laugh.  You're not laughing after 20 minutes. 
[00:56:00]  Maybe your mother should die of cancer.  All right.  Back to the piece, Anthony, all right?  All right.  The guys say their fans are the coolest, and they love the attention.  You know, they come up, they say, love the show, or, geez, that show you did the other  day was great, or disgusting, or, you know, they just comment on what we've been doing.  Yeah, we get recognized every day.  It's really cool, I've got to admit.  I laugh when celebrities are like, oh, it's such a hassle to be recognized or ask for an  autograph or a picture. 
[00:56:30]  I mean, we love it.  They say their audience is...  What are you saying there?  Are you saying you're a celebrity?  No, no, no.  But no, no.  Come on, didn't it come across like that?  You know, certain icons really don't like to be bothered.  You know, when you're a legend, you know, I'll be.  You know what, though?  I was walking down the sidewalk with Ben, getting lunch.  Strutting, like in Saturday Night TV, yes, just like we did in the beginning of the piece.  And, you know, one of our listeners said hi, and I'm like, oh, my God, I just had that 
[00:57:00]  whole speech on TV last night.  I better make it look really cool.  And you really didn't.  You really didn't.  Did you throw them off?  No, I did not.  I will not accept that, because we did not do that.  I was like, no, man, I'm really hungry.  No, you said, you know, you did.  We went into a restaurant.  But all of a sudden, I'm thinking in the back of my mind, we said that whole thing on TV.  We don't want to make it look like it was BS.  Right.  We're a bunch of tools. 
[00:57:30]  I have more of the piece.  They say their audience is one big reason they're so successful.  But we think the naked ladies have a little something to do with it.  Either way, they don't take their success for granted.  As long as I can remember, I wanted to do this, sure.  I used to sit in my room with a little radio, listen to Casey Kasem and people like that,  and go, someday I'd like to have my own radio show.  Those dreams paid off.  But before they made it, Anthony was in construction.  And Opie worked at a Long Island radio station.  Then the two met and hit it off in 1994. 
[00:58:00]  Yes, sir.  And this long-distance dedication goes out to Opie listening in his bedroom.  Hey, go out and play with your friends.  It reads, Dear Casey, I'm a boy in my room listening to you.  I've wanted to do radio my whole life, and I'm only eight years old.  Can you help me get into the business?  Signed, Opie. 
[00:58:30]  Well, Opie, get out and find a girl or something.  Play with your friends.  You shouldn't be in your room listening to Casey Kasem.  And where are those goddamn pictures I was supposed to see?  Oh, no, now we're going to have to play that.  Get Don on the phone.  We're going to have to play the Casey Kasem mountain.  Oh, my God.  All right, we can continue.  Lonely Opie.  Listening to Casey.  They hosted a radio show in Boston and then wound up here in New York.  If you didn't do this, what would you be doing? 
[00:59:00]  No, we're up to our room.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Now.  All right, we'll play that a little bit.  Maybe going into break.  Nice laugh, Deke.  What would you be doing?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I know the abuse is coming.  Hold on.  Hit it off in 1994.  They hosted a radio show in Boston and then wound up here in New York. 
[00:59:30]  If you didn't do this, what would you be doing?  I don't know.  I was good at caddying.  Winning that caddy tournament.  That or he could be a surfer with that hair.  Shut up, Ben.  How would you like to mow my lawn?  Huh?  Yeah, there you go.  I've never had a real job.  Getting up early, doing a job that you really don't enjoy. 
[01:00:00]  It's obvious they like this job.  Wow, look at that.  Oh, yeah.  They sit up nice.  Nice.  Right, Norton?  Nice.  There's the Norton contribution to the piece.  Nice.  They show you on the floor and your face completely, you know, covered by a big white egg.  Yeah.  And the other clips they show, I'm in the background just blinking rapidly and looking lonely.  Both grew up on Long Island and say they've pretty much been doing this show their whole lives. 
[01:00:30]  Only now they get paid.  We decided we were going to come in here, do our show the way we've always done it, and make some noise for ourselves.  And it attracts attention.  And once you get people listening, then they realize you're giving them some entertainment, some fun on the drive home, and they stick with you.  Yeah.  Opie spilled his guts in an interview today.  What did I do?  Well, you had to bring up, um, back in school.  I don't even know how this came up.  You heard it here first. 
[01:01:00]  Back in school.  You heard it here first.  Here's the shocking part.  You heard it here first.  An exclusive.  Back in school, Opie would pull some pretty disgusting stunts.  Always looking for the cheap laugh.  I used to eat, like, gum from underneath the desk for money and stuff.  You know what you should have done?  You should have told them about that time you talked out of turn.  What a dick.  Pipe down over there. 
[01:01:30]  Pipe down.  Did my homework in two different colors.  Pipe down.  Now, now.  You heard it here first.  Chewing used gum.  So how do their families react to their raunchy, sometimes vulgar show?  Oh, God.  Oh, man.  Guess who's not wearing underwear?  There's a couple of times I go over for holidays and she goes, I had to turn it off.  I had to turn it off.  Okay, Mom, you're not in a demo.  I understand.  It gets to be kind of a pain. 
[01:02:00]  You know, you go home and you get yelled at a little bit because you're gawking at girls.  Many have compared the duo to another infamous radio personality.  They say there's no comparison.  Wolfman Jam.  Quite frankly, we're funnier.  They're talking about Howard Stern.  But there was a time when they were banned from...  The line that was said 800 times last night.  Completely out of context.  Whatever.  I'm not going to...  We said a lot of cool things and that's what they decided to use.  Over and over again during the Yankee game as Ann and I are calling each other like, oh, my God. 
[01:02:30]  What did we say?  What did we say?  Oh, no.  The company's going to be pissed again.  What did we say?  What did we say?  Even saying his name because of past on-air battles.  Ann and I are vicious when it comes to, you know, competing in this business.  And we're really good at fighting back.  And when they took that away from us, we felt like, you know, cats being thrown outside without their claws.  You're not going to be fighting back too well, are you?  Howard, Opie, and Anthony all work for the same parent company.  But now the guys have signed a new deal and they're free to talk about Howard any time they want. 
[01:03:00]  We don't need to go on the air and talk about Howard.  But if he's hinting to, you know, what he's been saying for years, if somebody gets on the radio and becomes popular that they're ripping him off, we want to be able to respond to that.  And that's all.  Some critics say the hit show is sexist and racist.  The guys call it an antidote to political correctness.  In the proper context of comedy, anything goes. 
[01:03:30]  Right.  Sex, race, disaster.  Don't put jackasses on the radio talking.  I want to hear the music, man.  All right.  They can chuckle because Opie and Anthony really do have the last laugh.  You will grow to adore us.  That's right.  Just give us time.  Now, if you want to give them some of your time, you can catch Opie and Anthony every weekday afternoon from 3 to 7 p.m. on WNEW FM radio.  Back to you, John. 
[01:04:00]  All right.  Thanks for listening.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was waiting.  Yeah.  I love that.  John Rowland.  Yeah.  I'm just waiting for them to come back because if you remember in the past when we did news things like up in Boston, they would come back.  They did a whole story on WOW up in Boston and just trashed us that this is the most awful thing in the world.  They come back to the reporters.  They're looking at the monitor and he turns, looks right into the camera and just goes, their parents must be proud.  And we're like, hey, he's editorializing this prick. 
[01:04:30]  Their parents must be proud.  John Rowland's just like, okay, 20 minutes.  He's like, we just wasted six minutes on that.  Who cares what he thinks?  He's a fat drunk.  Hey, Jimmy from production.  Yeah.  He took the whole piece and he.  What did he do?  I don't know.  Uh-oh.  I heard it's good, though.  He goofed on it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's listen to this.  Fox News in the studio.  What's up today, Anthony?  You know, some people call Opie and Anthony vile and obscene. 
[01:05:00]  F*** you.  We took our cameras behind the scenes to reveal the truth about Opie and Anthony.  What we found will shock you.  Shock, shock, shock, shock, shock you.  Sex, waste, disaster.  Vulgar show.  Disgusting.  Wrestling.  Unzipping.  Sex, sex, sex.  Vulgar show.  You will grow to adore us.  The Opie and Anthony virus is sweeping the country.  Now we're going to be real.  Prank, prank, prank.  I just sit in my room with a little radio listening to Casey Cason and people like, you 
[01:05:30]  know, people like that.  If you didn't do this, what would you be doing?  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  I was good at caddying.  If you didn't do this, what would you be doing?  Be like gum from underneath the desk from running the stuff.  Woo.  And Anthony virus is sweeping the country.  Free to talk about Howard any time they want.  Yeah.  There's no comparison.  I think, quite frankly, it was funnier.  Howard Stern.  It was funnier.  Free to talk about Howard any time they want.  We don't need to go on the air and talk about Howard. 
[01:06:00]  Howard, Howard, Howard, Howard Stern.  The Opie and Anthony virus is sweeping the country.  It kind of sucks in.  Opie and Anthony really do have the last laugh.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  This show is as funny as it gets.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, that's pretty good.  We'll put that together.  Steve?  That was, uh...  Jim put it together.  The music that was used was one of the beds I did with, uh, with this. 
[01:06:30]  That's, that's very good.  Props to Jimmy today, man.  Pretty funny.  All right.  Why don't we move on, huh?  Just too bad they couldn't get that cat without the claws lying in there.  Ha, ha, ha.  God darn it, we're like cowboys without our spurs.  Even, uh, West Coast Dave, West Coast Dave checked in and went, that was kind of a gay line.  But, you know, working off the cuff.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Like sheriff without our badges.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:07:00]  O.P. and Anthony, 1027, WNEW.  Richard Jenny's out there? 
[01:07:30]  Get him on the phone.  Richard Jenny's, uh, a comedian.  Playing Caroline's all this weekend, Anthony.  Called up yesterday.  Yes, he did.  At the end of the show, wanted to, uh, come in.  Mm-hmm.  Plug his, uh, show.  Caroline's.  And, uh, for some reason he kept getting disconnected.  Right.  And, uh, we invited him to come in today.  Hello?  Yeah.  Hello?  Who's this?  Richard Jenny.  Who's this?  Richard Jenny.  Hey, uh, Richard, it's Opie and Anthony. 
[01:08:00]  How are you?  Opie and Anthony, how are you?  Good, how are you doing?  You good?  I'm just peachy, thanks.  Uh, when are you coming in?  I was thinking about coming in, uh, today.  Today?  Yeah.  At what time?  Probably about, uh, 440.  440?  It's, what, 422?  Yeah, I'm, I'm really close by.  Where are you?  I'm actually staying in the lobby.  You're outside the studio?  Yeah, I've been, I've been staying in the lobby.  I didn't want to miss you guys. 
[01:08:30]  Hmm.  And you want to come in and do the show?  Yeah.  If it's okay, if you're not too busy talking about Ron Jeremy's, uh, penis, I could maybe  stop in.  Well, Ron's coming in, too.  You get along with him?  Yeah, you said yesterday, right?  Yes, I've met him before.  In fact, I used to do jokes about him in my life.  Oh, you did?  I used to do a joke about big hairy fat guys with hair on their back getting, getting all  kinds of chicks, and he came up to me.  I did the porno awards.  That's how I met him.  Oh, really?  I had a bit in there about fat hairy guys getting all kinds of women. 
[01:09:00]  And he comes up to me and he goes, you were talking about me, weren't you?  And I go, no, no, I was just a generic fat porno hairy guy.  It wasn't really you.  When you tell that joke on stage, do you get a laugh?  That wasn't actually the form.  It was just telling a story.  Oh, I thought you said that's something you do in your act.  Do you want to do a prison visit?  Do I want to do a what?  A prison visit.  No, why would I want to do a prison visit?  Well, that's where you're on the phone like you are now, and then you step up to the glass  on the door to the studio.  Right.  And you talk that way. 
[01:09:30]  No, I'm not doing that.  Come up to the glass.  It'll be fun.  It's like Oz.  You ever watch Oz?  Why can't I just come in?  I can't just come in the studio.  Are you worried about germs or something?  We're going to have Ron Jeremy in.  That was really funny, that thing yesterday.  It was really funny.  What thing?  The thing where you kept hanging up on it.  Oh, yeah.  It would be funny if we hung up on you right now.  I think it gets old.  It gets old after a while.  Yeah, it does. 
[01:10:00]  This is our new game.  You're 15 feet away, and we're making you call us on the telephone.  At first, I was pissed off, and then I just started cracking up.  We were so juvenile.  Were you really mad?  At first, I was.  What the hell was that?  How could they do it?  And then I just go, that is just so asinine.  I have to laugh at it.  But if you're going to get mad at something like that, maybe you shouldn't be on our show,  because we're juvenile.  That's true.  Yeah?  Well, it's up to you.  I was hoping you'd put me on.  Are you going to be funny, Richard?  Yeah, I'll be funny. 
[01:10:30]  Well, I'm sold.  I'm sold.  Not to put the pressure on you or anything.  I'll be funny.  Like, what's the first joke you're going to tell on the air?  Stop it.  You're totally putting him on the spot here.  Do you have a riff on, like, Clinton or anything?  Any riffs on things in the news?  There's lots of riffs on whatever you want to talk about.  Yeah?  But I've got to be in the studio to do it.  I'm not funny in the lobby.  Yeah.  So you got any knock-knock jokes? 
[01:11:00]  He's laughing at the juvenile stuff again.  Knock-knock.  Knock-knock.  Who's there?  Richard Jenney.  Richard Jenney who?  Richard Jenney, you're hearing knock-knock because I'm pistol whipping Opie and Anthony.  Get it?  Richard Jenney who?  Sorry. 
[01:11:30]  All right, Richard.  Can you give us a few minutes to think about it?  Yeah, think it over.  Opie, you are just the worst host.  Ever.  All right, hold on, Richard.  Someone wants to talk to you.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let's go to Paul.  Paul, what's up?  What's up, boys?  You're on the air with Richard Jenney who's right outside the studio on a phone.  Yeah.  Do yourselves a huge favor and leave him where he is.  Why?  Why?  He was on Ron and Fez yesterday and I felt like sticking a steak knife in my forehead. 
[01:12:00]  Oh.  Richard?  He was more boring than church.  Richard, did you have a good time on Ron and Fez yesterday?  Yeah, I did.  But actually, I feel like sticking a steak knife in his forehead, too.  Oh, he was horrendous.  He was horrendous.  All right, Paul.  Thank you.  That's not nice, Paul.  Richard Jenney came all this way.  He's in the lobby, outside the studio.  Right, Richard?  In the lobby.  Not for much longer.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  What does that mean?  Wait a minute, Richard.  I thought you know how to have fun and stuff. 
[01:12:30]  Come on.  You're wearing me out with this crap.  We're just having fun and hanging.  All right.  All right.  You're not having fun with this?  Yeah, it's funny for like a minute.  Yeah, but you know, some things are funny, right?  And then they get unfunny.  And then the longer they go on, it comes right back around and gets funny again.  Yeah, I guess.  We're waiting for it to get to that point again.  All right.  It's really not there yet.  We'll have a long wait.  Richard, do you know what our show's about? 
[01:13:00]  You ever hear our show?  What have you heard about the O.P. and Anthony show, Richard?  Nothing.  Not much?  Nothing?  No.  Are you from New York, or where are you from?  Originally from New York, yeah.  And where you live in L.A. now?  Yeah.  So you're not familiar with this show?  No, but it's so popular.  So this could be like commonplace, and you wouldn't know it.  We might do this to every guest we've ever had.  Are we on the air right now? 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  Oh, man, really?  Yeah.  Why?  What, you thought this wasn't on the air?  No, I thought we were just talking.  We are.  It's a talk show, kind of.  All right.  I'm hanging up.  All right.  What?  Hello?  Why did he hang up?  Did he hang up?  What's going on?  Rick, go see how that went.  He's right outside the door.  What's the matter? 
[01:14:00]  We were having fun.  Why is everyone coming in here?  What's up, stinky?  Stinky, what's wrong?  Nothing, nothing.  I don't fear for my life.  Is he okay?  Pacing a little.  Rick, go smooth things over, Rick.  Rick, you're the producer.  Take care of things.  No, we're going to go to the listeners and see if they want Richard Jenny on the show.  There he is.  He looks like he's going to kill us.  Richard Jenny, come here, sit down, man.  Are you doing this or not?  Oh, no, come on. 
[01:14:30]  It's all fun.  Richard Jenny, how are you?  Aren't you a good sport, Richard?  That's Opie over there.  I'm Anthony.  Uh-oh, he looks all uptight.  What's the matter?  You spend too much time.  You're wasting time, right?  It's like a waste of time.  See, now you've got to be funny.  No.  After we just pissed you off.  He looks all pissed.  Here, get on the mic.  It's just, let's see how much we can screw with Richard.  That's what we do on this show.  We're idiots.  You want a shot of Jaeger?  Are we on the air right now?  Yeah, we're on the air.  You want a shot of Jaeger? 
[01:15:00]  We got a machine.  No, thanks.  Look what it did to you.  I know.  Would you like a beer or something to loosen up?  No, I don't need a beer.  No?  No.  It's not about meeting it.  It's just, you know, you want to hang out.  Yeah, no, I don't drink.  You don't drink anymore?  I never started.  You didn't?  No.  You've never had a beer in your life?  I had a couple.  I've had beers.  I just never got a taste for it.  Oh, I got you.  Okay.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Michael feels bad, too, now.  Michael, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right.  Listen, Richard, you're a real radio whore, aren't you?  Well, me and your mom. 
[01:15:30]  How many shows are you going to be on, man?  I mean, come on.  What's the problem?  What other shows would be on a radio show?  He's not funny.  He's, like, miserable.  He can't even go with the flow.  I mean, you know.  Well, we busted his balls the last two days.  Well, I mean, that's what comedians are all about, but I really like you anyway, man.  You're a good guy.  All right.  Thank you.  I don't care.  Oh, man.  A lot of people are uncomfortable out there.  I know.  Brian, what's going on?  Richard, I was thinking, just thinking back to some time when I was watching the UPN Network 
[01:16:00]  and your brilliant sitcom Platypus Man.  Right.  Oh, that's right.  You were on that?  It sucked.  It did suck.  Well, finally, somebody is.  All right.  I'll take that one.  It did suck.  Come on.  It was a bad show.  Did you see that, Ant?  No.  But how big an idiot are you for watching it, though?  What do you have going on in your life that you were watching a show that bad?  Come on.  Stick a knife in your forehead.  Where are you from originally?  New York City.  New York City.  Brooklyn, New York.  Brooklyn.  And you never made it out to the island when you were living here?  Yeah, I did, but it was crappy then. 
[01:16:30]  Right.  Governors of a crappy club then.  Now it's gotten a lot better.  Now it's great.  Well, the beaches you went to out there, right?  You know what I did recently?  I went on...  Oh, here comes a joke.  All right.  That was a joke.  Come on, Richard.  I get it.  Richard, let me explain something.  Look at two little babies.  He's going to conform to our show.  Don't say...  We're not going to do the show.  He wants to...  Be more buddy.  Don't say two, because Opie is...  Press button, you big loser.  Press and button.  Be more buddy.  Opie's the biggest prick.  Let's cut him off.  He's starting to sound like he's going on us and we can't take it. 
[01:17:00]  I was listening and Opie is a prick.  You don't have a sense of humor?  Can you say prick on the radio?  Yeah.  You can say prick, sure.  They keep changing it.  Really?  Yeah.  You just can't use it in the context of a unit.  Right.  Like I have a big...  Yeah.  You could call someone a prick.  You could say don't be a prick.  Okay.  But you can't say I grabbed his...  Glenn.  And then use the word.  Glenn, what's up?  Oh, man.  You guys got to cut Richard Jennings a break.  We are.  The hanging up yesterday and then having to wait out in the lobby.  Oh, I haven't laughed his heart since Gary Coleman. 
[01:17:30]  See, Nancy from Jersey.  Opie, you are such a rude, unfunny a-hole.  See?  See?  You're being bad to Richard.  See that?  All right.  People are mad at you.  All right.  What were you going to say?  I wasn't going to say anything.  I'll be quiet.  We'll do it your way.  I'll be quiet.  We'll do it your way.  You're a big shot radio guy.  Let's not let him be funny on our show.  We're the funny ones.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You're only bringing the comedians to abuse them.  Don't say we.  I was being nice.  I want to sit here.  I'm listening to what you say, and we allow a lot of people to be funny on our show. 
[01:18:00]  See, you didn't do your research.  We allow them to be funny.  Well, you know what I mean.  We allow them to be funny.  We have this now officially turning uncomfortable for me.  We have this show, and people come in, and they're funny, and we don't care.  All right, okay.  All right?  So what were you going to say?  I forgot.  What were you going to say?  I don't remember.  I don't remember.  What were we talking about, Ed?  I don't remember either.  You're being rude.  It was something about Long Island, right?  Yeah.  And governors.  Yeah.  And then you were going to say something.  I don't want to talk about this.  Let's do whatever it is you do. 
[01:18:30]  We don't do anything, Rich.  This is what we do.  We just sit here and do nothing for four hours a day.  We goof on people and make them feel uncomfortable.  That's our gig.  We have to abuse the comics.  No.  All right.  We're trying to get along.  We love the comics.  We've had a lot of comics on here.  We had Jay in here yesterday.  We had Jay.  We have Norton comes in all the time.  We've had Andrew Dice Clay in here.  Ron Jeremy's coming in a little while.  He's not a comic.  He's pretty funny.  He wanted to be a comic at one point.  He's got some comics.  Have you watched some of those movies?  You watch his movies? 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  I've seen a couple.  Have you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've seen those back in his heyday.  Yeah.  He's great.  He's quite the guy.  He's...  I like...  I...  You know, people think that...  We should say this on the air.  That people...  This is a misconception that people have that men like porno, which is false.  It's men's penises that like porno.  Right.  So, like, any guy, no matter how stupid he is, he's going, this movie sucks.  It has a bad plot, to any people.  But the penis is going, it's genius.  It speaks to me.  I haven't seen performances like these in years.  I must have it for my collection. 
[01:19:30]  So, I like Ron Jeremy.  He's a big, disgusting character.  Uh-oh.  Some people call him a hedgehog.  I got a porno dish.  A satellite dish that plays porno 24 hours a day.  Yeah?  Plays other things, too.  You like your porno?  You got a steady?  You got a steady gown?  You're never disappointed.  You never sit there going, gee, I didn't think it would end that way.  It was really good, right up until then.  Up until the money shot.  And then the whole watch just fell apart.  What the hell happened there?  Tony Camacho, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing?  It's Tony Camacho from Rascals in New Jersey.  Yeah.  Now, it's the only room that Rich is not working in the New York area, and Jersey, whatever. 
[01:20:00]  And I still got to say he's the funniest man on the planet.  There you go.  The proof is, go watch this man perform, and then get some opinions, because Rich is funny.  What's your act like?  I'm really, I haven't seen your stand-up.  Never?  Just like, no.  You have HBO?  Yeah.  I saw him on HBO and stuff.  You are?  Yeah, he's very funny.  You never saw me ever?  I swear, no. 
[01:20:30]  You're the target demo, man.  I know.  You're an Italian guy from New York, aren't you?  I, I, I...  Are you Italian?  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  From Brooklyn.  Target demo.  Never saw the act.  It's, uh, you know, what can I say?  It's your act.  You stand there, you talk.  I stand there and I talk.  Is it filthy?  No.  No?  No.  Very clean?  It's a little filthy toward the end.  Yeah.  But the whole thing isn't filthy, no.  Okay.  No, it's not.  A little lifestyle stuff?  It's, it's, you wouldn't like it.  No?  It's not annoying.  It doesn't embarrass anyone.  I like all forms. 
[01:21:00]  It's not, it's not into humiliating anybody.  We like all forms of comedy.  Let's break them down like a rifle and wheel them.  Oh, we like Jim Norton, who's as dirty as they get, and we love Brian Regan, who's as clean  as they get.  And everyone in between, Jay Moore and the rest of the guys.  So you just have to go through a certain amount of abuse until you get to be part of  the Opie and Anthony family.  Yeah.  I think we just got off on the wrong foot somehow.  That was, that was, that was Anthony's idea yesterday.  I don't know how that happened.  I think it's maybe because we hung up on you, and then when you were here, we called you 
[01:21:30]  from the lobby, which would be really funny if it wasn't happening to me.  Hey, I like that.  See?  It's always funny unless it's you.  Yeah, it's always funny unless it's happening, unless you're the guy.  Well, why don't we take a break and regroup?  All right, we'll regroup, Opie.  And we'll like start over.  All right.  We'll start fresh.  If you start yelling at us, we're just going to turn the mics on.  I'm not yelling.  Yeah, be prepared, affiliates.  We might just pop the mics up.  Yeah, because if he's going to yell at us, everyone else has to hear it, too. 
[01:22:00]  Right.  I'm not.  Richard, Jenny.  I think we should go to an Italian restaurant, all three of us.  Yeah?  And I'll forget my gun inside, and then it'll all be fine.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  Hey, really fast.  Was anyone else watching the Today Show this morning?  A guy made a complete fool of himself. 
[01:22:30]  No, I missed it.  You missed it?  Yeah.  I usually don't wake up that early.  I was tooling around, and there's a guy, a young guy.  It could have been more than, like, I don't know, early 20s in the front line,  and he asked his girlfriend to marry him, Anthony.  Yeah.  So they get back from commercial.  You know, he does the whole plea, I love you, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I want you to marry me.  Ah, a very popular thing to do on the Today Show.  Now, the Today Show eats something up like that, of course. 
[01:23:00]  Love it.  So they get back from commercial, and they said, you may have been watching whatever this  guy's name was, you know, ask his girlfriend to marry him.  Well, we have his girlfriend on the line.  And then they go, Susie, or whatever her name was, Susie, did you hear, you know, your boyfriend  and, you know, say he wants to marry you?  And she goes, yeah.  And then Matt Lauer goes, so what do you think?  And now they're all expecting the big, oh, yes, I'll marry him.  Wait, he was there live.  He was there live.  He's proposing. 
[01:23:30]  She's on the phone?  Well, he did it just out of the blue.  Oh, okay.  So then one of the producers from the Today Show obviously said, wow, this is pretty cool.  Give me the number.  We'll get it on the phone.  We can make something of this.  We'll call your girlfriend up, see if she was watching, and we'll get the answer for you.  How romantic.  So Matt Lauer's got the lady on the phone and asked if she saw the boyfriend asking her  to, you know, marry him.  Uh-huh.  And she goes, yes, I saw that.  And then there's just dead silence.  Oh, no.  And then Matt, he doesn't know what to do, so he's like, um, is there anything else you 
[01:24:00]  want to say?  Like, maybe I do?  Um, well, I'm on the phone.  Put it back in your pants.  Um, yeah, I'm kind of busy right now.  Ow, use more lube.  So Matt goes, is there anything else you want to say?  And they have the guy, just his face on the screen.  And she's like, fine, fine, fine, fine.  She does not say I do.  She doesn't say I don't. 
[01:24:30]  She says nothing.  It was so dead silence.  So effing uncomfortable.  And then Matt hinted again, uh, is there anything else you want to say?  And she goes, well, I hope he comes home soon.  It's a little joke.  Ouch.  The guy made a complete fool of himself on national TV this morning.  Oh, that hurts. 
[01:25:00]  So then it was just uncomfortable as you're looking at this tool.  He's going to pull a Dickie Betts on it when he gets home.  Oh, smack.  Oh, you made me look like an idiot on Donald Trump.  Get back to me, you won't.  So Vince.  Marry me.  Vince Vaughn is in the studio because he's promoting a new movie.  He was so uncomfortable, he goes, dude, man, we're doing a premiere tonight in New York.  Be my guest.  There's going to be plenty of ladies there.  Yeah, well, you've got to help a guy out like that that just made a fool of himself on national television. 
[01:25:30]  And then the guy's like, well, can I bring my friend?  The guy was such a freaking tall.  My question is, how do you go back home after that?  Yeah.  How do you face your friends?  Screw going back home.  How do you face your friends?  Dude, you look like you're such a fool, dude.  You dick.  Yeah, that's bad.  You're going to get razzed for the rest of your life.  When you ask that question, you've got to make sure you know what the answer is going to be.  Hey, Bobby, I've got a video tape. 
[01:26:00]  You want to watch?  Look at this idiot.  Professing his love.  Is there anything else you want to say to him?  Watch this one.  Watch this one.  Ah!  You hear that?  Yeah, I hope he comes home soon.  I hope he comes home soon.  What a tool.  That's not ideal, my friend.  It was pretty damn funny.  So uncomfortable.  And the unshaved Al Roker, yeah, with his cane.  I know.  What has he got a cane from?  No, his cripple stick, whatever.  The crutch.  Oh, does it actually have the handcuff on it? 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, the handcuff is the worst crutch of them all.  Yeah, because yesterday on the Today Show, they had to show his knee surgery.  Oh, God.  How come any time on the Today Show, they have a procedure, we have to sit through it and see it?  Katie Couric's colon.  Remember that?  That was classic.  Who the hell wanted to see that?  That was classic.  Now, I swear to God, people don't realize, they think, hey, this is going to be an interesting  story that will captivate the American psyche and we'll be able to show it.  No.  Now, all I see when I look at Katie Couric is her getting a pipe. 
[01:27:00]  That's all I'm thinking.  Every time I see her now is Katie Couric laying on the table, taking the pipe.  Taking a lot of the pipe.  She took a lot of the pipe.  She had to.  They got to photograph her colon.  Well, now they got Al Roker.  They showed everything.  He was completely knocked out and they had to lift his body up to give him the epidural  or whatever.  Greenpeace help?  Into the spine.  They're pretty experienced with rolling over huge mammals. 
[01:27:30]  And now he hasn't shaved in a while because he's been out rehabilitating the knee.  He looks just completely stupid.  Does he look like a bear?  Just a big grizzly bear or something?  I can't put my finger on it.  He looks like something, man.  You know, a big, a huge Ewok.  God, maybe if you didn't weigh a thousand pounds, your knee wouldn't blow out on you.  You know?  It says it's from a car accident 15 years ago, Anthony.  Oh, is that what it is?  And he had reconstructive surgery.  It was supposed to last 10 and he went another five years and now he had to get the procedure 
[01:28:00]  done again.  Is that the official story?  Yeah.  I think if you didn't weigh a thousand pounds, your knee wouldn't blow out on you.  Did I say that?  And then the other knee needs the same thing, Anthony.  Oh, because of a different accident?  But he's going to put that off for as long as he can.  You know what I think, Hopi?  I have no effing life.  Because I do hate the show.  And you could call up Sandy right now.  She'll tell you.  Because I just scream at the TV.  You didn't watch the blonde-haired Regis?  Oh, I did check that out yesterday.  If you want to watch any daytime television, you've got to watch the blonde-haired Regis. 
[01:28:30]  Summer blonde month.  And blonde-haired Gelman.  Blonde-haired Gelman.  Oh, God.  As if Gelman doesn't look homosexual enough.  We put him in blonde hair.  Gelman, you're a flaming fat.  Kelly Ripper's more of a man than you.  I guess they're gone for the whole Mike Piazza look.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Regis dyed his hair back.  Yeah.  But now he just looks like an old man with a dye job.  Yeah.  He just screwed up his hair forever.  Forever.  And Gelman still has the blonde hair. 
[01:29:00]  It looks completely ridiculous.  Gelman, it's great.  When his face is buried in the pillow, I think it's a woman.  It looks like that dyke that was with Ellen.  What's her name?  Anne Heche.  Anne Heche with the short hair.  And she had the same ass.  That Gelman nine-year-old boy ass.  There he is.  Look.  He's celebrating his 70th birthday in the paper today.  Even though his birthday is not until August, Anthony.  Why is he celebrating?  I don't know.  Jesus Christ.  Maybe because he probably is.  Come on.  He's Irish.  What? 
[01:29:30]  Noah's funny.  And we've talked about this with Regis, Anthony.  Yeah.  Jon Stewart was hosting with him.  Yeah.  Really funny guy.  We love Stewart on this show.  And you know how we discuss how Regis doesn't know anything about his gas.  I have no clue what you do.  He would interview the people from Survivor and have no clue what the show is about.  He does this all the time.  If you really want to have fun when you watch Regis, he knows nothing.  My favorite whole thing with Regis knowing nothing was when they brought the computers out.  Yeah.  I think Dale or something was doing a promotion with the Regis Philbin show there. 
[01:30:00]  And they wheeled out these computers that they were going to give away to some rube in Texas that could answer a question.  So Regis had to demonstrate the computer.  He couldn't even turn it on.  And then he gets all upset and everyone's laughing at him.  But you can tell he just feels like an idiot.  I don't know where the on button is here.  And I'm supposed to be, what is that, down trolling?  What do you do with these?  Gellman, help me here.  And they're all laughing at him.  I have a floppy what?  No, I don't.  Ask George. 
[01:30:30]  Hot as a rock unless I'm drunk.  That's great.  I was in P-Town with my blonde hair by the pizza place.  I couldn't get a guy.  With my blonde hair.  Then I met Marker.  Yeah, I love the callback.  He gave up the balloon knockout.  So this morning, I had the sausage.  Don't slice it.  What am I, a piggyback?  That old gag.  This morning, he has Jon Stewart.  And I guess the Daily Show and Jon Stewart won a Peabody Award. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  So they're talking about that.  And then all of a sudden he goes, you know, that's great.  You know, that show you do, the Daily News.  The Daily News?  Is that the show?  He gets everything wrong.  He always gets things wrong.  And the funniest thing, he's on the goddamn game show where you've got to answer questions.  And you're looking at the face of a guy that couldn't answer one of these goddamn quests.  Jon Stewart's a nice guy because I would have just broke out laughing.  And Jon's like, you can tell he's a little uncomfortable because he's like, oh my God,  the guy just, you know, he doesn't know the name of the show. 
[01:31:30]  So Jon's like, yeah, I guess I'll just start calling that now.  You're on 60 Minutes.  Is that the show?  What are you on?  We'll check you out.  The Daily News.  On the Daily Planet.  No, it's the Daily Planet.  The Daily Show.  You idiot.  So you're Dudley Do-Right.  What was that?  Oh, Gellman, help me.  And then he had Puff Daddy on.  I don't care what he's calling himself.  He's Puff Daddy.  P. Diddy.  I even know that, too.  P. Diddy.  P. Diddy. 
[01:32:00]  Well, Puff Daddy, he goes to Puff Daddy's parties out in the Hamptons.  How quickly do you lose your street cred when you got Regis going to your Hampton parties?  Oof.  Regis is a gangster now.  P. Diddy.  I'm a gangster.  Right.  Gellman, remember, always keep the trap open so I can drop my Glock in there if the heat start pulling us over.  I'm not going down like Biggie Smalls.  I want armor plating on the side of my door.  And I'm wearing the blonde hair now as a discount.  I'm East Coast, Gellman. 
[01:32:30]  I'm East Coast.  Don't be dissing me if you're West Coast.  Kelly Ripper's my hoe.  I love her.  I'm not getting caught on weapon charges.  Can't you see?  You hypnotize me.  Regis, Regis, Regis, Regis.  I'm going back to Cali. 
[01:33:00]  I shot a cop in Oak Town.  Yeah.  He's too friggin' much, man.  You hang with J. Lo, Regis.  Yes, J. Lo.  I love that, what they call booty.  Booty.  She's got the big booty, Gellman.  I like that.  She got booty for days.  Booty for days.  I like the fat-ass hose.  You like the bleach-blonde hose with the big butts?  I like them bleach-blonde with the big asses. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  That's all right.  And they like me because I can pay the rent.  I like that.  I got benefits.  Well, that's a callback from two weeks.  I got the benefits.  Two-week callback.  Nice.  Do you know any M&M?  There's one.  I love it.  The green ones.  They make you horny.  No, no.  The artist.  It's candy.  M&M.  Never heard of them.  How about Dr. Dre?  Snoop.  Snoop Dogg and Dogg.  No, I like the new stuff.  A little gin and juice.  I said a hip-hop, a hippie, a hippity-by, hip-hip-hop. 
[01:34:00]  You don't stop rocking.  To the bang-bang boogie set up, Chuck the boogie.  To the river, I'm out of the boogie, the beat.  That was a good song in its day, Reg.  That's a little old show.  I just heard it last week.  Dun-dun-dun-dum.  Dun-dun-dum.  Dun-dun.  I can't touch this.  Don't touch it, Gellman.  That's MC Hammer, man.  We got to pray.  We got to pray just to make it today.  What? 
[01:34:30]  Do you know any DMX or who?  DMX?  Who is that?  I only know the current artists.  Yeah, like what?  I like big butts that I cannot lie.  That's so old.  I do.  Oh, she's a brick house.  I'm really going old school.  You're into, like, Little Bow Wow.  Who?  Little Bow Wow.  Never heard of her.  No?  He's too freaking much, man.  All right, why don't we take a break?  We're Regis, whoever the hell you are right now. 
[01:35:00]  I totally forgot where we were going.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there.  Hour, hour, hour, hour, hour, hour, hour, hour, by Opie and Anthony, serving New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  This is 1027 WNEW, New York.  This is the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:35:30]  877-692-1027 in the studio.  Otto and George.  Hi, guys.  Sandy Kane is ready.  She's ready to sing her.  So we had to take a break because Sandy Kane had to get ready. 
[01:36:00]  She wants to sing her Jerry Seinfeld song, Anthony.  We got her music ready, and I don't know why she's...  Oh, my God.  Horrible.  Horrible.  What a little...  I just want to get it, like, a little stimulated.  Sandy.  Yeah, I like the 20 in your little G-string there.  Yeah, if I had so, I gave it to me.  Really?  It's fake.  Yeah, and Wolverine's a good house pet.  That's great.  Sandy.  Feather boa she's got on, and she...  Sandy, move over to your left. 
[01:36:30]  I've got to see what you're wearing.  Not too far.  Oof.  And she's got...  Is it my fly down?  Oh.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Oh, my God.  Man, I can't take much more.  Just when you thought there wasn't another horrific sight of her body, we get to see another one.  I am so horny.  I am so horny.  Are you?  Yeah.  Well, good luck.  Yeah.  You guys are really turning around.  You know what's a good orgasm?  Suicide.  Slatter yourself from the Chrysler building. 
[01:37:00]  I was going to commit suicide, but my mother would kill me.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Come on.  Barney Miller's in reruns.  You're not getting no money.  You're trying to kill yourself.  Right.  Really, seriously.  If I kill myself, you'll be the one...  Best orgasm.  Suicide.  You'll have my blood on your hands.  Slatter your filthy body.  George, you're getting confused.  That's not fish with a wig.  Oh, it's not?  No, it's any fish.  No, that's a...  What do I smell?  Tommy, can you get me off the hook? 
[01:37:30]  For old times' sake.  The meat curtain will be picked behind the toilet.  It's perfect for us.  It's got the old toilet with the pull chain.  Yeah.  How did that guy know what the toilet looked like?  What, did he take a leak in every John in the five boroughs?  Louie's in the Bronx.  It's perfect.  What are you?  This guy goes a lot.  Okay.  Go ahead. 
[01:38:00]  Sing your little song, and then in the back of the head, put a snow shovel.  You know what happened?  I had the O&A song that I sang on my own show.  I wrote a song for you.  This is fascinating.  I wrote an Anthony song.  Yeah.  And then last night, truth, I swear to God, I had a wet dream about Jerry Seinfeld.  So it made me feel that that's a song I should sing.  All right.  Stop dancing around and sing already, you crit keeper.  It's true.  Sing already.  Sing or die.  Sing or die.  Sing or die.  Jerry Seinfeld had a wet dream about him.  All right. 
[01:38:30]  Anyway.  All right.  We'll see if this makes the radio.  Waiting for the music.  Sandy Cain.  Yeah, it's very clean.  And her Jerry Seinfeld.  The wet dream wasn't, but.  Disgusting.  The wet dream wasn't.  Really?  She's very well endowed.  Oh, no.  Take those away from her.  You're not allowed.  You don't need those when you sing.  Stop bringing the vibrator in here.  Take.  We got special headphones.  They go back into the acetone.  That is funny.  I didn't know we did that.  When Sandy Cain comes in here, she's got her own special headphones.  How much is it to steam clean a console anyway? 
[01:39:00]  Disgusting.  No.  Don't say.  Don't say.  You just.  It's okay.  Just have one.  Don't say it.  Just don't put it in any context.  All right.  Don't talk about it.  That, please.  I'm sorry.  All right.  What.  It's been a tough.  It's been a tough life.  All right.  I'm going to start your music.  Okay.  Sandy.  Shut up.  Shut your selfie hole, you scum.  Just be quiet and sing your.  Well, I mean.  Sing your song.  You like me for my hemorrhoid.  Shut up. 
[01:39:30]  You do.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Yeah.  Oof.  I didn't have a hemorrhoid.  Thank God.  Shut the F up, please.  Freaking panties.  Oh.  Tell Mike I always liked them.  Freaking panties.  Oh.  I can't hang my hat in Brooklyn.  I thought I was going to go totally naked here.  You know what?  I want to see if she can do something, okay?  I thought I was going to do totally naked here.  Sandy.  What?  I don't know.  I want to see if you can shut up for 20 seconds, okay? 
[01:40:00]  Going to give her 20 seconds.  Starting now.  You can't let the alarm go off.  Oh, that's right.  Dead air alarm.  So we'll say something.  You said something.  I knew she couldn't do it.  She couldn't.  She talked.  She was like, I got up for 20 seconds.  She just made a noise.  I'm going to sing this naked, but I guess I won't.  No, that's okay.  No?  You don't think so?  I don't know.  You couldn't take it, you guys?  No.  Take it?  Is that throw up on your bra or is that supposed to be there? 
[01:40:30]  Where?  I don't know.  I like the design.  Is that throw up or is that part of...  It's a flower.  That cross around your neck doesn't burn right through your chest?  I smell vermin, poontain.  Anyway.  All right.  Sandy, I'm going to start your music, okay?  Okay, baby.  Another current song.  There she goes.  Jerry, Jerry Seinfeld. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, baby.  Jerry, baby.  Jerry Seinfeld.  Won't you f*** me tonight?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  What are you...  Don't talk.  Don't say anything like, can't you say, blah, blah, blah.  Don't...  Shut up.  Shush.  Shush.  Shush.  You can't say that.  You can't say the...  Shut up.  Shut up.  Holy... 
[01:41:30]  F.  Sandy.  Shut up.  Don't...  You can't say this.  Jesus.  Come on.  I'm breathing.  I want to punch you in the face.  Listen to me.  Why can't you shut your f***ing trap?  How come when I'm saying you can't say something, you then say that word?  Don't say it.  Shut up.  Don't say anything.  That...  Now, don't say it.  The C word you said can't be said. 
[01:42:00]  Don't say it.  I see you gearing up to say it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What did you throw at her?  What was that?  Car.  Nice.  That was a near one.  That's your...  Sandy.  That's your Jerry Seinfeld music.  You can't say.  Oh, that was her music.  Wow.  Nice rage.  That was beautiful.  Wow.  You got some kind of disorder.  No.  That's for sure.  That's...  She dresses up to it.  Yeah, but the lyrics are come out tonight. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, I know, but you didn't say come out tonight.  Now, Sean...  You used the other version of that word,  and you put it in a context...  Can I do it again?  Not that way?  Don't you want her in the air?  Yeah, I do.  No, but I mean, I'll do it...  Look, Otto...  You guys got me so horny  that I had to do it that way.  I am so horny  that I had to say it that way.  Well, okay, look.  Can I just do it one more time?  Let's do it back up.  Let's play a game.  If we have to dump out of you  one more time in the show,  we get to throw stuff at you. 
[01:43:00]  Tell O and A I always like them.  Everyone pick up something  you're going to throw at Sandy  if she gets dumped out of again.  Right.  This is what we do.  This is what we do now.  See, this is what we do now to you.  Can I do this topless?  We do now to you this now.  I've got to do topless.  All right.  I can't help it, man.  She's got innies.  You see that?  What happened to those things?  She's got innies.  What happened?  They never came out.  They never came out.  They never developed.  Yeah.  I'm still waiting.  Was that the suction that happened 
[01:43:30]  when your uterus fell out?  It just pulled everything in?  I don't know what happened to me.  Is that what happened?  It's been a tough life.  They never developed.  They never came out.  Sandy, there's a handsome  can driver by Central Park  called Niji.  He's got a family at Puris.  I need you to trot him  through the park.  Now I can sing.  Now I can sing.  All right.  Is it all queued up yet?  Yeah, we're going to do it again.  Let's try.  Now, look.  Here's the game.  I'm going to throw a scissor.  I have a half full bottle of Coke.  All right. 
[01:44:00]  Ben's got a videotape.  Otto, George.  Yeah.  Do you have a CD?  I don't want to.  Violent show.  No, you want to hurt him.  Empty bottle.  I can't hang my fun bags in Brooklyn.  All right.  We're going to try the song again, Sandy.  Okay?  Violent people.  Ooh.  All right.  Who wants to throw the Magic 8 ball?  I'll do it.  All right.  Here we go.  Give me something hot and moderate to heavy.  Moderate to heavy.  Yeah.  All right.  Don't get dumped at them. 
[01:44:30]  Watch those words.  Here she goes.  Jerry Seinfeld song.  Jerry, Jerry Seinfeld, baby.  Throw it now.  Jerry Seinfeld.  Won't you come out tonight?  All right.  Jerry, Jerry Seinfeld, baby.  Come out tonight.  Come Jerry Seinfeld, won't you come out tonight? 
[01:45:00]  Jerry, Jerry Seinfeld, baby.  Why don't you come Jerry Seinfeld, and ooh, you can bring Opie and Anthony, too.  Bring Otto, and bring George, too, and you can ring Rick Delgado, ooh, ooh, yeah. 
[01:45:30]  Jerry, Jerry Seinfeld, baby.  Oh, screw it.  Just throw things at her anyway.  I'm out tonight.  Come Jerry Seinfeld, baby.  She's got it hard.  Come Jerry, baby.  Just throw things at her anyway.  Come Jerry Seinfeld, baby.  You can bring Jerry's finger at you. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Jerry Seinfeld, baby, I'm Jerry Seinfeld. 
[01:46:30]  She won't let you come out tonight.  Come, Jerry Seinfeld, ooh, bring up me and Anthony, too.  Come, Jerry Seinfeld, baby, bring up me and Anthony, too.  Come, Jerry, baby, move, said you.  She's durable.  You're throwing stuff at a chick that's probably used to taking right hooks. 
[01:47:00]  42nd and 8th I worked for 10 years.  Wow.  So you're used to things being thrown at you?  42nd and 8th and comedy clubs.  Oh, my God.  How close did the scissors come?  Not close enough.  We survived the Opie and Anthony show.  Steve saw the one shot.  I heaved the wiffle ball bat and hit it right in the face.  I threw Ben's ice coffee all over the front. 
[01:47:30]  I'm into S&M, man.  I love it.  Whip me, whip me.  Buy me, bring me.  Whip me.  I love it.  Wow.  Boy, well, you could take it.  That's for sure.  Yeah, that's for sure.  And I must say, I don't think we dumped out of your song.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  All right.  Sandy Kane, everyone.  I think we've got to take a break.  All right.  We broke stuff in here today.  Hello.  Yeah, I think we're getting broken.  Can I just say my show is on Saturday? 
[01:48:00]  Shut up.  Saturday night's now.  Love me.  That hat hurts.  Channel 56 on Manhattan Ava Network.  We're having you all on.  Why don't we play Brother Joe's Sandy Kane song as we go to break?  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, ah.  Known as Sandy Kane.  When she strips.  Ah.  She calls her stomach pain.  She is covered.  Ah.  With barricose veins.  And she has money rewards.  I don't play it.  Will you curl?  Oh.  When her pants come down.  There's a patch.  Oh.  It's crusty red and brown in his throat.  Oh.  Like Bozo the Clown.  Yes, she loves a hammer or rocks.  You're disgusting.  Hey, Sandy. 
[01:49:00]  You make eyes real.  You make eyes real.  When they look at your BD.  You make eyes real.  You're just a wrinkled old lady with no tears.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Sandy has vibrating tones.  That boasts incoherent noise.  She chases away all the boys and the girls and cats and dogs.  I don't play it.  One day, some retarded run. 
[01:49:30]  He went down south, but then he stung.  Started kissing Sandy's bun.  Oh.  And Twido bit his nose.  You nauseating.  Hey, Sandy.  You make eyes real.  You make eyes real.  When they look at your BD.  You make eyes real.  You ugly sound the old hoes back.  You're afraid of your BD.  Yes, Sandy used to strip in bars. 
[01:50:00]  Till they told her to stop that night, dear.  She would take off all her frigging clothes.  The customer's going blind, yeah.  But she had always made a few extra buns with a mountain hand.  Oh, wow.  Sandy and her ribs is really clean.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh. 
[01:50:30]  O.B. Anthony.  W.N.E.W.  W.N.E.W.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[01:51:00]  Otto and George in the studio.  Gentlemen.  How are you, my niggas?  Oh, that's a good one.  My nigga.  Hey, I just seen a black guy with a tattoo in the lobby.  He's like, yo, you like my tattoo?  I don't see nothing.  Where is it?  You should have used whiteout, you filthy animal. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, my God.  It's like an Irish guy buying a jock strap.  What are you going to put in there?  It's a waste of money.  I sugar.  Black eyes with tattoos, that's my new dick.  Now I steal.  It's good to race.  Good water.  Yeah.  We might have to explain Otto and George to a few cities out there, huh?  You've toured around, all right?  I just want to give a shout-out to Man Cow.  Die, you arrogant piece of garbage.  Die.  You suck with a goatee. 
[01:52:00]  Die, you a***** coming after you.  You stink on ice.  You don't like the Man Cow, huh?  I hate that prick.  I hate him, too.  Why?  He didn't treat you well when you were on his show, Otto?  Yeah.  He stinks.  He's not funny.  Horrible.  Yeah.  You guys are going to kill him.  Kill him in the ratings.  Oh, yeah.  I know it.  We're on in the middle of the night in Chicago.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah, we're working on it.  They really get our show in Chicago.  So what?  You catch up?  Yeah.  That guy stinks.  So George is the puppet.  George is a puppet, yeah. 
[01:52:30]  Who says all the rude things.  Yeah.  See?  That's how he gets away with it.  That's right.  I curse a lot.  That's right.  Use cursing as a crutch.  It's more like a motorized wheelchair.  I'm doing better.  I'm down to 9,000 a show.  Dump out.  We're dumping out already.  I was reading an article today.  Bob Barker just signed for another six years and the price is right.  He's already 900 years old. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  When is he going to die already?  The first item up for dead was a stagecoach.  They're going to be calling the...  He's senile.  They're going to be calling the show.  The price is pretty freaking close.  That's material.  What I love about Otto, it's radio.  He doesn't need to bring in George.  Yeah.  But I don't think you can do it without George on your lap, right?  Yeah, you got to hang out with a puppet.  You should be like that guy in Castaway talking to the soccer ball. 
[01:53:30]  You should be double dating with a coconut.  You see that movie Castaway?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  He tells you on the island five years.  You should have lit up the joint.  Ten guys would have showed up.  They would have been off the island.  Fire it up, man.  Let's get out of here.  Guys, don't lead.  Hey, that's really...  All right.  What was that soccer ball's name?  Wilson.  Wilson.  Wilson, yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to a support group now for people who've seen the movie I-A-A-I. 
[01:54:00]  What's that?  A-I.  A-I, right, yeah.  I'm in a support group now for people who want to kill themselves after watching it and  the Jay Moore TV movie of the week.  What is that?  Horrible.  Ugh.  You didn't like Jay Moore's movie?  Did that stink?  Was that called Black River?  Black River was on, what, Fox or something the other night?  Wow.  What was that?  Yeah, it was on after midnight.  Horrible.  To Jay's credit, he called the show and warned us that it was going to be really bad.  A preemptive, it sucked. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, man.  Someone, you know what?  I don't want Jay mad at me for the line I'm about to say, but a bunch of people wrote  in and said that Jay, in that movie, looked like the kid from Mask.  Dennis?  Rocky Dennis?  Rocky Dennis.  Jesus, man.  I know.  That's cold.  Two hours, he's walking around town looking to buy a calling card.  Wants to call up Barry Katz.  What the hell happened here?  Hello, filthy Jew?  Why am I in this piece of garbage?  That would be his agent, yes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:55:00]  Barry Katz.  Yeah.  Hi.  Jay, I got a great movie for you.  Just relax.  It'll be fun.  Just enjoy it.  Be loose, man.  You'll get a check.  Filthy hook-nosed Jew.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Nah.  See, it's okay, though.  George says all the crap.  It's not Otto.  It's a puppet.  It's a puppet.  How can you get mad at a puppet?  It's a puppet.  Even though, I mean, we tell the story every time Otto's on the show.  It got so rude at one of his shows once that someone did attack George the Puppet.  Stabbed the puppet. 
[01:55:30]  Stabbed George the Puppet.  Yes, there was a stabbing.  And hit your hand.  I got no insurance, man.  I just got to lay there until I feel better.  There's no insurance for comedians.  It's been too long, Otto.  Oh, my God.  I'd like to do a quick impression.  Paula Poundstone.  Okay.  Your Honor, I'd like a Pop-Tart, and then I'd like to f*** the dead girl from Postergeist.  Postergeist.  I want to f*** the dead girl from Postergeist.  Give me a Pop-Tart and a bottle of gin. 
[01:56:00]  Lick that f***, you filthy whore.  Die in your lecture chair, you f***.  Die.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I'm the fat hack.  I lick s***, I'm the dead.  Die, die.  No, no, no, no.  We're out of dump.  Hold on.  Wow.  Hold on.  We ran out of dump.  And we were doing so well, Otto.  We were doing so well.  Jesus.  What did he say?  I didn't mean to hear you.  Yeah, it was bad. 
[01:56:30]  I'm sorry.  It was really bad.  The Paula Poundstone material might not fly on the radio show.  Oh, no.  Oh, it's really funny, but.  Yeah, now they're blaming it on her drinking problem.  Yeah, yeah.  They're saying that she drinks a little bit and then might have done a couple of things  under the influence of alcohol.  Drinking.  Drinking f*** juice from a six-year-old.  That's an excuse.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Did he dump out?  Yeah, we dumped out.  Now we really don't have any dump left.  We don't have much dump left in our show.  Everyone's running in saying, stop him, stop him now, please. 
[01:57:00]  We've got no dump left.  We're in seven cities.  This is bad.  Suddenly, I'm not half the man.  George Harrison's dying, I heard.  I hear he's got brain cancer.  Ooh.  That's a bad illness.  They were saying, though, it's under control for now.  It's under control?  Yeah.  Brain cancer?  That was bad.  Oh, man.  Fire up the bong.  He's dead.  Jeez, that's sad.  What else is going on?  How is that? 
[01:57:30]  Well, maybe we should be...  I'm hesitant to bring up a subject.  Yeah, don't curse.  We're back to normal.  Don't curse.  We're almost back to normal?  Yeah.  Not yet?  We're getting there slowly.  Hey, why don't we bring Sandy Cade in?  Have you met Sandy Cade?  No, Adam.  Oh, my God.  No, I haven't yet.  She's a...  We don't even know how old she is.  She's got to be 70.  Really?  70?  70.  70.  God bless.  Ex vaudeville.  I'm talking about that.  She just blurts out sound.  She spends time in peep shows to this day.  She walks around with a device.  Hey, what the hell is Aide Pagoda doing in here? 
[01:58:00]  That's Sandy Cade.  Hey, you filthy animal.  They're talking about you, Dildo.  Aide Pagoda.  I got my own here.  I got my own.  I got my own.  Horace show.  Oh, my God.  Right here.  She walks around with her friend...  Dildo.  Mr. Dildo, yes.  I need a...  No, no, no, no.  A D.  A D.  A P, a C.  Hey, George, don't hold back.  What do you think of the lovely Sandy Cade?  Welcome to the show, Sandy Cade.  Hop on the counter.  We're going to burn your meat curtains with a hot crack pipe.  I'm the committed with my house.  You want to be in show business, right? 
[01:58:30]  How are you?  Oh, you're disgusting.  I'm glad I have you with me.  So what empty refrigerator box did you crawl out of today?  You skank in a fright wig.  Looking house on Haunted Hill looking whore.  You're dying.  God, are you a skank?  Meat curtains, hot crack pipe.  Yeah, she wore the wig today, George.  Oh, my God.  What the hell is Aidsicota doing in here? 
[01:59:00]  All right.  Hey, wait.  You know what?  It might be worth it.  Oh, Jesus.  Sandy, can you show George the growth?  Show George.  Show what?  Show George.  He's heterosexual, George.  Yeah.  Show George the growth.  Ian from New York Magazine.  Move over so Sandy King can grab that microphone.  You want to explain the growth, Anthony?  Because we do have a couple new markets.  New cities, new cities, new cities.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  She has this thing growing on the, let's just call it the area. 
[01:59:30]  The area.  You know, there's something growing there.  We think it's genital warts, but we're not sure what it is.  But it's growing there.  It looks like the ear that they grew on the back of that lab rat, that lab mite.  Keep Dr. Fides away from me.  Go one more mic over.  All right.  All right.  Sandy, would you like to show George the growth?  We've all seen it.  Would you like to see it, George?  Yes, you filthy bag lady looking whore.  Whatever it takes for a career.  Okay, here it is. 
[02:00:00]  Burn your meat curtains with a curling iron.  Here's my V.  Here's my V.  Look at this.  Look at that thing.  Ah!  Oh, what is that?  Killer and barrier.  Oh, is that horrible?  You think I should have an operation, maybe?  Take it off?  Think maybe then I could get a man?  Oh, God.  I don't know.  Walton's is making a big comeback.  Could you please cover it back up?  Cover it up.  Oh, my God.  You know what we call it?  You ever see the movie Total Recall?  Yeah.  You know that little thing that was growing out of that guy called Quado? 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  We call that Twado.  Oh, God.  It's the conjoined twin that's just growing out of a, I must talk to Twado.  Oh, my God.  I need to see a priest and visit a vomitorium.  Oracle looking person you are.  Okay.  What about those fun bags?  Don't you like people for the, I mean, I'm a nice person.  You're a nice person?  Yeah, I go to church on Sundays.  You're a mentally ill, filthy bag lady.  Well, I don't have a bag. 
[02:01:00]  You don't have a bag?  I have a vibrator here, but that's about it.  Your vibrator's going to go gay.  That's disgusting.  Well, Ben's over, George.  You had it customized, man.  It'll be the first time.  Oh, my God.  Have you ever gotten it?  No, no, no.  All right, hold on.  I don't need that.  Hold on.  You're a triple X.  You're a triple X.  All right, hold on, though.  I was thrown at a John's camp PA, so.  Hey, Sandy, explain to Otto and George the teeth.  Do I have to?  She's very sensitive about her teeth.  Yeah, I mean, hey, what teeth? 
[02:01:30]  Well, you told everyone.  Yeah, I know, but, you know, it's like, you know, it's a tragedy.  Do you have a tissue?  What?  Tissue.  I don't even know you.  Oh, man.  You should be Cain in Singapore.  You should be Cain in Singapore.  That's why my name is Cain.  But, yeah, it's, you know.  All right, listen.  What do you do exactly?  How do you get money?  That's a good question, man.  Yeah, you know.  She works the peep shows.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, there was a guy on my balcony, the balcony where I live, and he was looking in at me today, 
[02:02:00]  and I'm wondering what I should do about that.  He was, like, looking on the balcony, and I was totally nude.  It's a cop.  He thought it was a crime scene.  No, then he followed me down the elevator and out the door.  So I just had to air that.  So you don't want to talk about the teeth again?  About the dentist and the thing he did to you?  Well, no, I just, I had this dentist, and he just...  There was a boyfriend?  Boyfriend.  There was a lover?  Lover.  I thought that's why...  I was that bad in bed that he did that. 
[02:02:30]  Well, why would he do it, then?  I thought you guys had a little romance going on.  Oh, no, he was just a dentist I knew for a long time, and he had a partner, and she's  like, it's a long...  Can I show you my V again?  No.  No.  No.  Listen, I've had a very tragic life, so...  All right, I'm going to explain that.  Run the X-ray without the bib on this 30-horse.  Oh, my God.  Why do you say I'm a whore?  Why do you say...  Why do you say the third rail?  Why do you say I'm a whore?  Well, look what you do to get on radio.  What do I do?  I put a vibrator in my...  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. 
[02:03:00]  Thank you.  You can't say that.  Yeah, you can't say that.  Nice.  No cursing.  Yeah.  Yeah, we can't be cursing all the time.  Can I just make one announcement, though?  Sure.  Because it's very important.  Yeah, of course you do.  Because I'm on public access television, so I can do whatever I want or say anything I want  or show anything.  So sometimes it's hard to...  I just did a show.  I can say anything I want.  Gorgeous.  Right.  I love you guys.  So it's hard to...  Yeah, just because you're so good looking, you know, and you're lucky.  It's hard, too.  You should...  So anyway, my show, Manhattan... 
[02:03:30]  This is tragic.  No, I'm on public access.  Just tragic.  I'm on Saturday nights from now on.  And you know what?  I'm inviting these two on.  Otto and George?  Yes.  Because I think they're hysterical.  Why isn't George looking at you anymore?  I don't know.  I'm not easy to take, huh?  I don't know.  I'd rather drink AIDS out of the cooler.  Well, maybe I'll do this show in the dark.  Yeah.  And maybe you should off yourself in the high building.  Splatter yourself in front of the hard rock. 
[02:04:00]  That'd be good for the radio, too, wouldn't it, Nack?  Good exposure, huh?  Yeah.  Splatter yourself.  Sidney is looking at the puppet and getting really pissed.  I know.  It's too funny.  I like short guys.  Why am I a magnet?  I like short guys.  Like this one.  All right.  What are you doing later?  Let's exchange blood tests.  I had a baby do-da, do-da.  I like him.  I like George.  He's my type.  Thank you, Chris.  He's got a woody. 
[02:04:30]  Why do you put on makeup in the morning?  Why do I do that?  Why?  It doesn't work?  It doesn't help?  No, I'm just saying why.  Why?  Do I look better without makeup?  I'm not saying anything.  I'm just saying why do you put makeup on in the morning?  Because I try to look better.  Oh, okay.  And I try to be Sandy Cain.  You are Sandy Cain.  Right.  No, not without makeup.  Oh, you're not?  And earrings and this bra.  I have a shower on public accents if things switch to Saturday.  I also have an etch-a-sketch with one knob. 
[02:05:00]  I can only do circles.  Ugh.  Whore with no future.  Ugh.  George is hilarious.  Nice to her.  Otto, you're okay, too.  Yeah.  Thank you.  All right.  What do you think of those fun bags, though?  Good luck in your chosen career.  I'd like to kill you with a snow shovel.  That'd be good radio.  Strangler and killer.  Hey, George, have you been breastfed?  Yeah, with doorknobs. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, show George your boobs there, Sandy.  Maybe that'll turn them around.  I've seen enough.  70-year-old boobs.  Here they go.  70-year-old.  How old are you, Sandy?  How old are you?  Can you keep a secret?  Yeah.  Well, that's mine.  I know.  You say that every time you're on a show.  70 years old.  Flash the crow.  Oh, God.  The power of Christ contels you.  The power of Christ contels you.  I cast you out on clean steering.  The power of Christ contels you.  He loves me, Jesus. 
[02:06:00]  He loves me.  Yeah, Jesus is very open-minded.  Hey, scene one, scene of both.  Hey, George, would you like to see...  By the way, I talk to Jesus.  He hates your guts.  And he ain't too crazy about Norris either.  George?  Yeah.  Would you like to see Sandy Kane's hemorrhoid?  Oh, no.  Why do you hate me?  Yeah, I just ate Mexican food for the show.  What did I ever do to you?  I just gave him Taco Bell.  You gave him Taco Bell?  Yeah.  I just gave...  Would you like to see my hemorrhoid, George?  Yeah, you gotta...  I don't want to see no more. 
[02:06:30]  Just don't get close.  Just give a long-range view.  I did...  No, no, no, no.  Hold on.  No, you can't.  I'm gonna yank my own eyes out like Ray Moland.  I don't say the F word.  Sandy, you gotta move a little more that way.  All right, hold on.  We're dumping it out like crazy.  But you guys...  Sorry, I'm sorry.  You guys gotta check this out.  Being honest.  Okay, you're part of the gang, and we've all seen this, George.  The hemorrhoids?  And Otto, yeah.  Yeah, you gotta see the hemorrhoid.  The hemorrhoid hemorrhoid.  We think it's...  We think it's more...  I could always speak next July. 
[02:07:00]  All right, George.  Look at this.  Disgusting.  All right, would you like to see it, George?  Yeah, but then again, I like bustions.  All right, let's see the hemorrhoids.  Okay, all right.  Get the...  Look.  Let's see.  I cast you out, unclean staring.  Okay.  Is that awful?  Oh, God.  What is going on back there?  Why, can you see it?  We saw everything.  It's dropping out, saying hello.  All right.  It's like a jack-in-the-box.  It needs exposure, you know? 
[02:07:30]  Well, I mean, you know, I think rear ends are very unexposed.  No one looks like...  Um, George, what did you think of that hemorrhoid?  Not too good.  Not good at all.  Not good.  It was as big as George's head.  Not good.  Actually, compared to the Jay Moore TV movie, The Witch, that was pretty interesting.  Staring to the old whore's starfish.  And I got to pay for my own parking.  Otto, you'll never forget our show now.  Oh, God. 
[02:08:00]  You don't see that every day, huh?  Awful.  Yeah.  Thanks for not washing your one piece, whatever that is.  It's not clean back there?  You were a nutty.  No, there was like...  I wiped.  There was something going on.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I wiped.  Yeah.  All right.  No.  No.  It looked like...  I don't know.  You ever see right where the planes hit the runway of Kennedy?  It's where all the rubber rubs off.  It's what it looked like.  You had those skid marks going on.  Really?  But that's on flesh.  Uh-huh.  What the hell's going on back there?  What is your nature now, folks? 
[02:08:30]  You're not nuts.  Didn't mommy and daddy give you enough love when you were a child?  No.  I guess not.  Anyway.  But no, as long as I wiped.  There's nothing brown back there.  Oh, God.  Cut it out.  I'm sorry.  It's true.  I would be very embarrassed.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Sandy, so why are you here today?  I was going to sing the Jerry Seinfeld song.  Okay.  You have a Jerry Seinfeld song.  Yes.  Is there music to this?  Yes.  All right.  Do we have music?  Yes. 
[02:09:00]  Steve has it.  We've got to take a break.  Steve says he needs a couple minutes to get the music so Sandy can sing to it.  Ray.  I'll never be the same.  That's frightening.  Otto almost dropped the puck when he saw that.  I need to see a rabbi.  Oh, God.  We'll be back with the Sandy Cain song, Anthony.  Great.  The Jerry Seinfeld song from Sandy Cain in just a bit.  Our, our, our, our, by O.P. and Anthony.  All owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNEW, New York. 
[02:09:30]  I just needed someone to talk to.  You were just too busy with yourself.  You would never live on me.  You would press on myself.  I just don't miss you.  I'm older and I feel like I could let some of this anger in me. 
[02:10:00]  But it seems to serve as I am tragic.  It's the best that I have made.  All right.  So, someone asked about the four-foot pen with Ken Stevens, our boss.  Yeah.  And it's official.  We have signed, we have signed our contracts, Anthony.  Yeah.  We did that right after the show.  Right after the show.  And then we boosted it up with the boss, telling all sorts of fun stories. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, yeah.  So, after our little get-together after the show yesterday.  Yeah.  It was getting too late to jump on the train back to Long Island.  So, I'm, I have to stay in the city.  You stayed in town last night.  Got to do it.  But I wasn't prepared to stay in the city.  As you will notice by the same clothes I'm wearing today that I did yesterday.  Now, Opie, Manhattan, New York City here.  Very hard to get a room at the last minute.  A lot of people like staying here.  Right.  There's a hotel I frequent, and I just figured they'd have a room for me last night. 
[02:11:00]  Right.  Oh, they were sold out.  Uh-oh.  They were sold out.  Now, I need to find a new hotel.  Now, I'm a little buzzed and a little tired, and I just need to find a room.  So, you didn't want to start making calls and find another hotel.  So, I went to the crack hotel across the street.  I can't believe you stayed there.  Ben was mortified.  You stayed at the crack hotel? 
[02:11:30]  Ben prides himself on knowing New York and knowing where, like, the hip clubs are.  Yeah.  He'll tell you where all the cigar joints are.  He knows all this crack.  I know.  And if you need a good room.  He knows where the hip hotels are.  He knows which hotels you should stay away from because, you know, as Ben said, the sheets are filled with...  I didn't say it, so don't dump out.  Ugh.  Man batter.  Man batter.  Man batter all over the sheets.  So, uh...  Ugh. 
[02:12:00]  So, I was tired, and my, you know, no rooms in the hotel I used, so I went across the street to the crack hotel.  Did you see one of those real tight, curled up black pubes on your pillow?  No.  It's nothing worse than knowing that a Hasidic Jewel fouled a hooker there about an hour before.  This place is such a dump.  Ugh.  Such a dump.  And I'm in the lobby, and you get all these...  You get all the rubes from all over the place that are coming to New York for the first time, and they... 
[02:12:30]  Because this hotel is close to Times Square, they're assuming it's a good hotel, because the lobby looks good.  Yeah.  It's Art Deco, Anthony, I believe.  Oh, yes.  Art Deco.  Yeah, they make the lobby look good.  That means they just haven't remodeled it since Art Deco was new.  These people have no clue what the rooms look like until they get upstairs, and they're in for a rude awakening.  Here's the key to toilets down the hall.  Sheets are ten bucks extra.  It's one step above that. 
[02:13:00]  Seriously.  There's a rotary phone.  There's a rotary phone.  A rotary phone?  In the room.  Right next to the bed.  Huge, huge mirror.  Uh-oh.  Huge mirror.  That's a bad sign.  You can see Opie asleep in his hotel bed on the internet somewhere.  Huge mirror.  Ridiculously.  I mean, it was the whole wall.  After signing his very lucrative contract, Opie decides to spend in the tens of dollars on a hotel room. 
[02:13:30]  Staying here in midtown Manhattan at the Flush Crack Hotel.  No expenses spared as man batter stains abound.  In this luxurious crap hole.  You know what you've gotten yourself into when you grab the sticky doorknobs. 
[02:14:00]  And that mirror next to the bed.  Full of video equipment.  And for a special surprise, open the closet.  You'll see a dead hooker.  Freshly killed.  The Crack Hotel.  The Crack Hotel.  You just signed your contract.  Let me get this straight.  Right after the show, we just signed our deal. 
[02:14:30]  Feeling pretty good about ourselves.  Of course.  And you stay at a Crack Hotel.  Basically.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Air conditioning was busted, so I'm sweating all night.  Oh.  Oh.  Sticky sheets.  I, uh.  Located near the Carnegie Deli for all your pot needs.  And I also knew that I had to wear the same clothes today, so I wanted to keep them nice and fresh for today. 
[02:15:00]  Opie's wardrobe never getting in the way.  Look at this closet.  Full of nothing.  So he wears the same cigar-smelling shirt he wore last night.  And my underwear and my socks.  I didn't want to sleep.  I didn't want to sleep in that stuff.  I hate sleeping naked.  Hate it.  What?  Had to.  Had to.  Oh.  Had to.  Oh.  Oh.  Had to sleep naked.  Don't like sleeping naked.  Had to sleep naked.  When it caused HIV in that bed. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, my God.  You wear hepatitis B.  Dude, wait a minute.  Had to.  Why?  Had to keep the undies fresh for today.  Oh.  That's all I had.  What are you doing in your sleep that wouldn't keep them as fresh as when before you slept?  You know, you sweat a lot during the day.  I had to kind of, you know, rinse them out a little bit and put them on the heater.  Oh.  Like a soup kitchen in your pants.  You're a pisser.  Wait a minute, but remember the sheets. 
[02:16:00]  The undies, you know, they kind of look like used shoeshine rags.  So I had to, you know, take care of stuff and.  I would have slept.  Had to.  In my clothes.  In the bed.  Shoes.  Everything.  I, no.  The AC, I finally got it to work and I got it blowing up some air to kind of keep my clothes  fresh.  Airing out the clothes.  The sheets didn't fit the mattress.  So I woke up in the middle of the night just sleeping on this crappy mattress, sweating  like a pig. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, my God.  Wait.  The bare mattress?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, you got a disease.  You have a disease.  It was the worst.  The W, you know, outside my window.  Where most hotels serve crabs in the dining area, Opie got his in the bed.  All this and complimentary bloodstain removal.  A place to hang your underwear while you sleep naked in our Petri dish bed. 
[02:17:00]  All at the Crack Hotel in Midtown Manhattan.  Ben thinks.  Any stray pubes?  Ben thinks.  Ben thinks that this hotel is used by all the hookers.  The drive-by hookers that we were talking about a few weeks ago.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:17:30]  No doubt in my mind.  And, yeah, the W was flashing outside my window all night long.  The neon light.  Right.  He's like, oh, I can't even get to sleep.  So then I wake up in the morning just drenched in, like, sweat on the mattress.  Just think if you were in there with a hooker, what they did before that.  Leaving all kinds of body fluids.  Body fluids abound in this luxury suite.  So, so I go downstairs and I get the paper and I go back upstairs and I'm reading about 
[02:18:00]  us in the post today.  Did you put the paper down on the floor so your bare feet wouldn't hit the right?  Right.  And, uh, and I had to laugh because.  I have to laugh.  There's an article in the post about, uh, Rush Limbaugh signing his, uh, contract for  $250 million.  That's right.  And our big boss saying that he would have, uh, doubled his salary if he, you know, would  have called him.  I think Mel was joking, but.  And then, um.  Um, and then they, they talk about some of the infinity properties. 
[02:18:30]  Yes.  Some of the infinity syndicated shows.  And they mentioned the Howard Stern show.  I miss.  And radio's fast rising dynamic duo, Opie and Anthony.  I'm reading this in the crack hotel this morning.  Laying in a crappy bed covered in your own sweat.  With the light blinking outside your window.  Reading how you're one of radio's dynamic duo.  Up and coming stars.  I'm like, man, I might as well just have a freaking needle in my arm. 
[02:19:00]  Look at this place.  Oh.  Watch out for the syringe.  Oh, man.  I had to laugh.  I'm, I'm reading and, uh, yeah, there I am.  That is something, man.  After signing his lucrative contract, he took off his underwear and retired.  In the man batter stained bed.  I had to rinse out the underwear first. 
[02:19:30]  In front of a big mirror.  Who knows what's behind it?  All kinds of wonderful video equipment.  As you were watching the porno movie in your room, you were the porno room.  Movie in 315.  You checked the TV guide.  So what's, what's naked radio personality?  Let me click that.  Hey, hey.  Room service.  No room service. 
[02:20:00]  Look at my hair.  Look at, I had to like, I don't know.  Yeah, it's looking like kind of greasy.  Yeah, because it was the hotel shampoo and not even the good guy.  Oh, no, it probably wasn't shampoo.  Oh.  You know what I'm going to do?  I'm going to crank off a batch into the cream rinse bottle.  That's what I said.  That whore just beat me.  Beat me out of my money.  I'm going to get the next whore that tried to shampoo her hair. 
[02:20:30]  I'm going to crank off a batch right in the shampoo bottle.  Tony.  How you doing?  What's up?  Yo, how come, Opie, you just didn't sleep in your drawers and then free bag it today?  Yeah, why didn't you free bag it?  That's the safest, dude.  Why didn't you free bag it?  Any way you looked at it, though, you know, I had to take care of the undies.  No, they were hurting.  Dude, you could have at least, at least at the sun in that big deal,  go out today after, you know, taking a shower and buying a pair of underwears. 
[02:21:00]  You only went out and free bag it maybe for an hour.  Right.  I went to the Gap and bought a brand new shirt.  You could go to Dwayne Reed and pick up a package of underwear.  You could have done that.  You sleep in your underwear last night to just set up some kind of perimeter around your junk.  Do you guys understand that I could not continue wearing these underwear?  Well, I'll tell you this.  I took a girl to a hotel like that one time.  They were horrific.  Were they really a disaster area with police tape around it?  Oh, what happened?  You threw a puddle on your bike?  You know, it's like I'm the only one. 
[02:21:30]  It was a hot day yesterday.  You're sweating like a pig as you're walking around and stuff.  You know, things happen.  Working up the lather.  Things happen.  Like the horses that pull the little wagons out here around Central Park on a hot day.  They worked that foam up.  Were you working up the foam?  Well, uh...  There must have been hundreds of dingleberries in that bed.  Oh!  I just think everyone must say that.  Oh, man, this is filthy.  I'm going to take my underwear off. 
[02:22:00]  It was, uh...  And you're just like...  You might as well have just been...  Dude, you know what's going on in those beds?  You know what was going on in the underpants?  Butterscotch comes to mind.  Put it this way.  If you walked in that room, right?  Let's say you walk in the room.  There's a naked man in the bed.  He gets up, leaves the room.  Would you lay down in that bed?  They changed the sheets.  Oh, not at that place.  Not at that place, dude.  They had a Jamaican lady, you know, working the floors.  How about you said the sheets didn't fit and they kept sliding off the mattress? 
[02:22:30]  And then you wake up and you're on bare mattress.  And how many guys do you think that happens to?  I don't even want to think about it.  Everybody.  Very thin pillows.  Oh, the thin crack pillows.  It wasn't even a blanket.  It was just a spread.  No, wait a minute.  Now here comes another thing.  Spread.  Was it just one spread when you walked in the room?  Sheet spread.  Under the sheet.  Spread over the sheet.  There was no, like, top thing that you always throw off the bed the second you get in a hotel  because those are the drunk people that just have sex instantly on that? 
[02:23:00]  That was a spread.  That's what you used?  What are you going to do?  I need to be covered.  Oh, my God.  You have a communicable disease right now.  Right now.  No.  You've got to lock up your genitals in your underwear.  No sign of Twato walking around in your room?  No.  I just needed a room.  It was late and I had a crash.  And I'm reading about how we're the up-and-coming radio stars from my room at the Crack Hotel. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, great.  What an image.  Opie's sack frothing like a cappuccino from Starbucks.  It looked like someone dropped a mochaccino in your pants.  So, there you have it.  Wow.  What a paradox, huh?  Yeah, it's funny.  People think we're doing so well and it was pretty pathetic last night.  You were at the Crack Hotel.  Crack Hotel.  Why don't you go to the park or something?  It was right down the road. 
[02:24:00]  Well, I checked out of the Crack Hotel.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You checked out?  Yeah, I didn't check out.  I'm going to stay somewhere else tonight.  Oh, you're staying in tonight, too?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Check out.  It's called fleeing the area.  I still got to find underwear for tomorrow, but...  Did you go to Dwayne Reed?  You're better off staying at Stinky's house than at that place.  With his roommate.  Hey, man, it's still better than the times I had a crash on Ben's couch. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, really?  Oh, my God.  Well, you don't know what's...  Oh, man.  Dude, that's awful.  Oh, dude, my...  Dude, that hotel is disgusting.  Your couch...  Every one of your friends that have moved from Boston have stayed on that couch and you haven't  changed the sheets on that thing.  It's just as bad.  Plus, you get the extra bonus when you stay with Ben.  He wakes up in the middle of the night and giggles all night.  And then his phone rings at three in the morning because one of his drunk friends is still  loud and wants to talk to Ben at that moment. 
[02:25:00]  Funny that's what he does.  I don't know when you sleep, Ben.  Dude, you would have been safer just grabbing a refrigerator box and laying it in front of  the...  Laying it in front of the station's building.  Jesus Christ.  Dude, have you...  I'm serious now.  Have you checked yourself for crabs?  You really have to...  Look, during the break...  Please, listen to me.  Don't even start that.  When we go to break, go into the bathroom, really look around... 
[02:25:30]  I would know by now.  No, no, you might not.  Look, look, please.  You've got to check because if you spread crabs throughout this studio...  I'm not spread crabs!  We're the dynamic radio duo.  Just check.  You think the dynamic radio duo would get crabs?  It's crabs are like kryptonite to the dynamic radio duo.  My God.  Ziggy's laughing at you right now.  I've got a better place than you.  Try explaining that STD to your girl.  No, serious.  I caught these scabies from a crack hotel bed, I swear.  I have no STDs and I have no crabs. 
[02:26:00]  Thank you very much.  Check for crabs.  Rick, you got crabs once, right?  How long did it take before you knew you had them?  A couple of days.  A couple of days.  And if you saw early, you might see one clinging.  They cling on to the hair like...  They just grab on.  Hold on.  They...  They multiply...  Actually, what I saw was...  You know, you look down, maybe you're sitting on the bowl...  And you look down at your underwear, you take a glance...  You're like, what's that?  Oh, because there's all kinds of what?  Because the dead ones, after a while, they die.  They fall off into your underwear? 
[02:26:30]  They fall off into your underwear.  Rick's got the crack hotel in his pants.  So you look down into your underwear and you saw...  It looked like dandruff.  And I'm like, what the hell is that?  What color was it?  It was like a...  I don't know.  It looked like onion flakes.  Oh, okay.  It looked like onion flakes in your underwear.  So what did you do?  You picked one up?  Yeah.  And saw that legs?  I picked one up.  And you got to look really close at it like, oh my God, that's a bug.  I got a bug.  And then you're like, why is there a bug in my underwear? 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, exactly.  And then you look down at your area and you just saw them crawling around?  No.  I just immediately pulled up my pants and went to the doctor and I had to get it like,  you know, get the shampoo.  Get the shampoo.  I'll be scratching.  And you're scratching your head.  Dude, don't scratch.  Get in the bathroom and check it.  Dude, shut up.  You never know.  I'm doing it for your own protection and everyone else's.  You never know in those beds.  Oh my God.  I had a slight itch.  Oh my God, don't scratch. 
[02:27:30]  Gross.  Oh my God.  I'm fine.  But it was an interesting night, to say the least.  And then reading about us in the paper while I was in that situation, I'm like, man, what  the hell?  Reading about us in an article that contains figures like 25 million and huge radio companies  and there you are in the crack hotel in my own sweat, naked, because I'm still waiting  for my underwear to dry.  He walked in there, the crabs, like an amusement park, just sat down. 
[02:28:00]  Come on.  All right.  The police service.  Well, you know what?  Screw you guys.  I'm never sharing again.  F you.  Well, you can share the stories, just don't share anything you bring back from these rooms.  Get your balls out.  Slap your ass up.  Slap your scrotum.  It's today, though it may not be anyone's birthday, and it's not in the 4th of July.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:28:30]  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, guess this is fine.  Oh, guess this is fine.  Show me the power, old child.  I'd like to say that I'm down on my knees today. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, give me the butterflies  Give me a way  That I'm off on my feet again  Hey, I'm feeling  I'm feeling  I'll shine, I'll shine, I'll shine, I'll shine  Yeah, check it out, the O&A show 
[02:29:30]  877-692-1027  I think we're going to play a round of bra bingo.  Get the bad taste out of our mouths.  Not an awful way to put it when it was...  The show got a little too gay there.  Got a little gay.  Got to bring it right back to reality with some hot ladies calling up with their bra sizes.  Too much of the gay.  877-692-1027.  Bra bingo.  5x5 card.  Center square is a free boob square. 
[02:30:00]  Just like a bingo card.  Then you fill in the rest of the squares with random bra sizes.  Yeah.  Don't put all the good bra sizes in a row.  Don't cheat.  The best way to do it is to write down a bunch of bra sizes on pieces of paper.  You start with like 32 double A or something like that.  And you go all the way up to the ridiculous F sizes.  Put them in a hat.  Mix them all up and pick them out one at a time.  And then as you pick them out, you write them down on the card.  Random.  Or you could just get a random program and do it on the computer. 
[02:30:30]  Let's start bra bingo with Carrie.  Carrie, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, Carrie.  How are you?  I'm good.  All right.  You want to play bra bingo?  Yeah.  Of course.  That's why you're calling.  All right.  Why don't you give us your bra size?  32C.  32C?  32C.  Wow.  That must...  32C.  Oh, there we go.  I got that.  All right.  I got that.  Nice.  Thank you, Carrie.  No problem.  All right.  Bye.  Let's see Cindy.  Cindy.  Hi.  How are you? 
[02:31:00]  All right.  What's your bra size?  34C.  34C.  34C.  34.  Yeah, I got 34C.  34C.  There it is.  Thank you, Cindy.  Yeah.  All right.  I got that, but it doesn't really help me.  Danielle.  Yeah.  You're next for bra bingo.  Hey, what's up?  How are you?  Okay.  Hey.  Are you in your car, too?  No, I'm in my home, actually.  I'm cleaning.  You're cleaning?  Are you cleaning topless?  No, sorry.  I figured I had to ask. 
[02:31:30]  All right.  What's your bra size?  36DD.  36DD.  Hello.  Hello.  Double Ds.  36DD.  Do I have that?  Oh, I don't have the 36DD.  That's a nice size, though.  Thank you very much.  Damn it.  Thank you.  Thank you, Danielle.  Sorry.  Damn you and those huge melons of yours.  Melissa.  Yeah.  What's your bra size?  40D.  Wow.  40D.  40D.  Ooh.  I don't know how they got it.  Oh, oh, oh.  Wait, I do have 40D.  I got it. 
[02:32:00]  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Melissa.  Thanks, guys.  40Ds came in handy there.  Jamie.  Yeah.  You know how long I've been waiting to try and play What's in My Pants?  What's in Your Pants?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Jamie?  Yeah.  You all right?  Yeah.  I'm playing with a finger puppet right now.  You're playing with a finger puppet?  Yeah.  You don't know what that means, Anthony.  I'm not smart enough to figure that out.  You ever see a finger puppet?  It's a little puppet you put on your finger and you do a little puppet show. 
[02:32:30]  Okay.  Oh, okay.  I got the visual in my head now.  Yeah.  Jamie?  Oh, sugar.  Are you an African princess?  Half.  Half.  Yeah.  What's your half?  What half?  Upper or lower?  Italian and African.  Mmm.  Nice.  Would you like to give us a fake orgasm?  Mmm. 
[02:33:00]  And I'm not half-faking it either.  Wow.  Look at that.  That rocks.  Do we play What's In My Pants with Jamie or we just continue with Bra Bingo?  A mid-Bra Bingo What's In My Pants game?  A diversion?  Sure.  Let's go.  Why not?  All right, Jamie, where are you?  In your room?  Yeah.  What do you got on?  My boyfriend's boxers.  How old are you?  20.  And? 
[02:33:30]  I'll be 21 soon.  Yeah.  In September.  And that's all you got on is his boxers?  Yeah.  Nice.  What kind of posters you got in your room?  Alan Iverson.  A what?  Alan Iverson.  Alan Iverson.  Uh-huh.  Nice.  All right.  Lay down on your bed.  Over here, yeah.  Okay.  Hold on.  We got to play the theme song.  Oh, shit.  Let's do the theme.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play. 
[02:34:00]  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  Now they're having fun.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  Hello, Judy Pie.  I'm assuming you don't have the boxers on anymore, Jamie?  Um, I could get rid of that problem.  Yeah, that is a problem.  As you do that, Anthony will explain the rules of what's in my pants.  Well, we will ask Jamie to take the telephone she is on and move it around, as per our instructions, on a certain area. 
[02:34:30]  And judging just by the sounds coming out of that phone, we will try to discern what hairstyle she is sporting.  Is it the natural triangular shape?  Is it the mohawk, which is, of course, the landing strip?  Is it the Hitler mustache, which is a mohawk that has been shaved down to just a little tuft of hair?  Or is it the wood floor, also known as the JonBenet Ramsey? 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, this could be challenging, because I'm sure she has the nappy hair.  Now, Jamie, remember, very important on your part.  I love napp.  No clues, no hints as to what you're sporting down there, until we ask you, what is in your pants, okay?  It might be a little b****.  Um, she must be talking about the telephone.  Right.  Maybe we shouldn't mention anything about anything that's going on, okay?  Yeah.  All right, Jamie?  Don't bring that up, because they might dump out of things like that.  Let's just play Guess What's in My Pants. 
[02:35:30]  Jamie, if you would please take the phone and rub it in an up-and-down fashion.  Let's all listen.  20-year-old Jamie.  Wow.  Wow.  Okay, yeah, very telling.  Sure.  All right.  Side to side.  Side to side, Jamie.  Side to side, Jamie.  Oh.  Okay.  Circular motion.  Circular motion.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:36:00]  Okay.  There was some static electricity there.  Okay.  I think I know.  I think I know, too.  But can I hear the side to side one more time?  Slowly.  Slowly.  I got it.  Very telling.  Anthony, I'm saying wood floor.  I'm going with complete wood floor.  Jean-Bernet Ramsey, whatever you want to call it.  I'm, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, oh, man. 
[02:36:30]  Um.  Darn it.  I'm going to go triangle.  All right.  Ben?  Ben, what did you hear there?  No clue.  You're passing.  I'm too stupefied by what's going on today.  Rick?  Uh, can I just hear up and down one more time?  Oh, I didn't really hear that.  I'm going to go with Hitler mustache.  All right.  All right.  Well, the guesses are in. 
[02:37:00]  We've all heard it.  You've played along at home.  Jamie, if you would tell us, please, what is in your pants?  You ready, Fred?  What is it?  A big seat.  A big seat.  Oh, wow, wow.  Wow. 
[02:37:30]  All right.  That is funny.  I thought Jamie or whoever that was was up to some because the voice sounded too, you know, hot.  I think I had one of those voice things.  Is that funny?  If we weren't so distracted, we may have been able to pick up on that, but.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  Oh, my God.  Holy smoke.  Heather, what's going on?  Nothing at all.  How do I follow that?  I don't know.  Not with a deep voice. 
[02:38:00]  Please.  We're in the middle of playing broad bingo.  36F.  36F?  Yep.  36F.  You freak.  Does anybody have that at all?  I don't have a 36F.  No, I would like to have a 36F, but I don't have it here.  Well.  Hey, thank you, Heather.  No problem.  We got that.  We got it.  Godzilla.  That guy got it good, man.  God, I think we were nailed.  A big C.  I am stunned.  I just don't want to think about it.  I just want to move right on. 
[02:38:30]  I'm trying to think of whatever we said, like, during the time.  It's like, oh, I hope I didn't say anything.  I'll be called her an African princess.  Alexis.  Are you an African princess?  Shut up!  Nope, nope, nope, nope.  I'm a Puerto Rican princess.  We like Puerto Ricans.  What's up, Alexis?  Not too much.  How are you gentlemen doing?  We're trying to just move on with this. 
[02:39:00]  Trying to recover from a very...  It's been a bit overwhelming.  Very bad, man.  A few minutes.  I give the guy props.  He got us good, man.  Yeah, he did.  He definitely did.  What's in your pants?  A peeler.  All right, so what's your bra size?  36D.  36D?  Oh, I got that.  36D.  Nice.  Good luck.  Thank you, Alexis.  No problem.  All right.  Will's calling back.  Hey, Will.  What's up?  You suck.  Was that you the whole time?  Yeah, I had to get you guys once. 
[02:39:30]  Wait, do the voice again.  Yeah.  I'm laughing right now.  So, yeah, this is Jamie.  How are you?  I had to get the famous O.V. and Anthony just once.  Son of a bitch.  Because part of me is like hoping that there really was a girl there.  And then at the last second, you know, she gave the phone to her boyfriend.  No, it was me.  I used it to try and get bisexual women on the phone line.  How much do you just screw with people with that voice? 
[02:40:00]  A lot.  I met with my mom at work once, too.  Yeah, that's good, man.  You got us.  All right, guys.  Why weren't you laughing, though?  Why?  I was able to bite down.  I was laughing, but I pulled the phone away.  You suck so bad.  I don't even want to ask him what he was rubbing the phone on.  Yeah, what were you doing?  No, it was just my chest hair.  That's all.  Ah!  Ah!  How gay do you guys feel? 
[02:40:30]  All right, Will, you suck.  You too.  You're the African princess.  Well, yeah, leave us with a little something in that voice.  Go ahead.  Yeah, this is Jamie, and I love opium anthem.  Ah!  Ah!  You suck.  All right.  No, you guys suck.  Take it easy.  Oh, we got half.  That was awful.  I'm far from okay.  No, man.  I'm pretty effing far from okay. 
[02:41:00]  First thing, no one's got to hear about what happened here.  Ah!  Line 10's great.  Opie likes nappy hair on men.  Ah!  Got the nappy hair.  Corey.  Hi.  Hi.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, uh, we want to hear about your boobies.  Ah, 38C.  38C?  Oh, I got the 38C.  I got that.  I'm really all over the board here now, which kind of sucks.  I only need one.  I do, too.  Ben, what about you?  I need, uh, I need two. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, you need one up that way.  Oh, yeah, you're right.  Okay.  Hey, thanks, Corey.  Thanks.  Hey, wait.  I want to tell you guys that I have the hugest crush on Opie.  Wow.  Opie has the hottest voice.  Hey, wait.  What was your bra size again?  38C?  38C.  I'm sorry you didn't win, Opie.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye-bye.  I have the hugest crush on Opie.  He's got the sexiest voice.  Almost the sexiest vibe.  Don't get it.  Don't get it. 
[02:42:00]  Even worse, that guy was rubbing the phone on his chest.  We were living in a chest there.  Did you know what?  We all were.  I know.  We were all had.  But there was something in my head going, man, I mean, she, he.  Something didn't sound right.  Oh.  None of us picked up on it, though.  I have to get it again.  Yeah.  Annette, what's going on?  What's your bra size?  38D.  38D.  Oh, got the 38D.  I got that, too.  But, man.  Boy, these are spread out.  Right.  Heather.  Yeah.  Help me.  Help me. 
[02:42:30]  How are you?  Pretty good.  I wish I could help you.  All right.  It's bra bingo.  What's your bra size?  36B.  B?  Yeah.  36B?  Is that it?  Yeah.  Tell me you won, Ben.  No, I got one left.  Oh, damn.  I got one to go as well.  Nice.  I got one to go on two lines.  Thank you, Heather.  You're welcome.  We got to hurry up the game.  Come on.  Get us a fat bitch.  No, don't say that.  I need scallop oil.  Skylar. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  Hi.  Hey.  Skylar.  Hi.  Oh, she sounds like she's got little ones, too.  Skylar?  Yeah.  What's your bra size?  I have a 38B.  38B?  Mm-hmm.  I got that.  I got that.  Nice.  All right.  Oh, you guys got it.  That's fine.  I helped you out.  Wow.  Yeah, that's not a winner, though.  Thank you, Skylar.  Thank you.  All right.  One on three different lines.  Let's go to Margaret.  Look at the size.  Margaret.  Hi, guys.  Hi.  How are you?  Uh-oh.  This might be good for Rick. 
[02:43:30]  Margaret.  Margaret, do they call you large?  Marge.  Well, actually, my voice might be deep, but my chest is kind of small.  Oh, is it?  Oh, okay.  Okay.  I might be in here.  Help out.  Margaret, what's your bra size?  36 A.  I got the 36 A.  God damn it.  I can win any which way.  Are you a flat, so?  That's when I'm bending backwards.  Wow.  Wow.  36 A.  Thank you, Margaret.  Bye.  All right.  God, we're running out of show. 
[02:44:00]  Shannon.  Shannon.  Yes?  Hi.  What's your bra size?  32 A.  32 A?  Bingo!  Oh.  Son of a bitch.  32 A.  Yes.  Yes.  I love you, Olives.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Bingo.  Shannon, thank you so much.  You guys are the biggest.  Hey, wait.  Hold on.  We're going to give you a prize for having the winning bra size.  Of course, you're 32 A's.  I have 36 D going across the free boob square. 
[02:44:30]  34 D.  And, of course, 36 B.  Lucky.  Yeah.  Shannon, hold on a line.  We're going to give you something cool, all right?  Okay.  All right.  And thanks for playing bra bingo.  No problem.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  I still haven't figured out how I'm going to end this song, but we'll figure it out as  we go, I guess.  And don't dump out of me, all right?  I would suggest.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  They might dump out?  No. 
[02:45:00]  No.  Don't dump out of me is what I'm telling you.  Well, Rick's telling the guy, I'll maybe give you a little clue about the end of the song.  If you stop playing and singing, that's a good way to start the end of a song.  It's a good way to know that the song's over?  Yeah, yeah.  The song's over.  I've always found that works.  Because if you continue to play and sing, for some reason people think you're still going.  I don't get it.  Let's start it up here.  Stephen Lynch, everyone. 
[02:45:30]  There's no words.  It's just this.  I forgot my trumpet.  I'm a rich and famous doctor.  Always knew I'd be.  An expert in the field of gynecology. 
[02:46:00]  Next on my agenda, checking your pudenda.  Let me see what I can find.  If you get your nerve up, sip inside the stirrup.  Single thought will cross my mind.  I love putting women's minds at rest.  I love pushing myself to be the best.  Dr. Stephen's in awe. 
[02:46:30]  I thought they'd jump out of that guy.  I've got magic fingers.  The doctor of the year.  There's not a lip that I can't read.  A pap that I can't smear.  When your legs are open, I begin the groping.  But I fear I must be blunt. 
[02:47:00]  I would just as soon not go near your balloon.  I think that I'll stick to your...  Front.  The fade out.  The fade.  I felt the finger poised on the dump button for the whole thing. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  I thought you were going to say...  C and the...  Whoa.  Come on.  He said I thought he was going to say bunt.  Well, yeah.  Came out with a C in front of it, though.  I don't know how that happens.  It looks very, very glamorous.  And you know why?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Because it is f***ing glamorous, all right?  F***ing.  F***ing. </pre>
