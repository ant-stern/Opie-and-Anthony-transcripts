<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a "What Is Jane Doing?" segment, where the hosts guessed a caller's activity based on ambient sounds.  Jane was revealed to be doing bicep curls, after numerous incorrect guesses ranging from jogging and Taibo to praying and making fudge.  The show then segued into a discussion about genetically modified, glowing monkeys, fueled by "Old Dirty's" conspiracy theory about government surveillance of minorities. This segment was rife with crude humor and outlandish speculation.

Next, a phone call with Tommy Lee was attempted. The hosts pressed him about Pam Anderson's claims in a recent Larry King interview that he gave her Hepatitis C.  Lee was initially evasive and ultimately hung up, leading to a discussion about interviewing celebrities and employing vulgar and offensive language throughout the segment, with many references to Tommy Lee's sex life and physique.

The show included a call from Wheelchair Fred, a frequent caller.  The conversation started with a discussion of his past interactions with the show, including requests for money and his aversion to being labeled gay. This then devolved into a graphic description of a sexual encounter Fred had with an 18-year-old man, detailing the physical aspects and Fred's lack of sensation below the waist.  The hosts punctuated this with sexually suggestive jokes and comments.

Following this, the hosts played a radio audition tape submitted by Spaz, also known as K-Dog, who was present in the studio. The tape was widely panned for its poor production quality, incoherent ramblings, inappropriate comments about Hillary Clinton (referred to as a "carpet muncher"), bizarre tangents about a giant mosquito in Queens and its supposed link to encephalitis, the Waco siege, and general mishaps in identifying the day and station.  The ensuing listener calls, emails, and faxes reflected a range of reactions, from amusement to disgust and outrage.  The segment interspersed playing of the tape with listener reactions, additional commentary from the hosts and K-Dog, a contest promotion, brief sports commentary by K-Dog, and a listener's humorous anecdote about encountering the giant mosquito.  The segment concluded with further listener feedback and continued reactions to the audition tape and a brief discussion of a call to a phone sex line.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  No one has ever done anything like this.  I know you're out there. I can feel you now.  I know that you're afraid. You're afraid of us.  You're afraid of change.  I'm not what you think.  I'm going to hang up this phone and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see.  A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries.  A world where anything is possible.  There is, there is no green end of the shell alone. 
[00:00:30]  At my signal, unleash hell.  Welcome to the bottomless pit of Ignorance.  Here's a clip.  Jesus Christ, this is going to suck.  Is that mango or papaya?  That'll get our ratings up.  That's how we supposed to win in the ratings.  If we can't talk about booing our pleasure.  Suck it up. Walk it off, Zeke.  I love camel toe.  We're shaving for America.  No ass. 
[00:01:00]  I gotta see that ass.  No!  I would definitely be willing to have sex with you if we've both already had AIDS.  No ass.  Hope he says, it isn't bad.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Rude, disgusting self-centered pieces of trash.  You guys suck.  Blah, blah, blah.  Woo-hoo!  Yes, you.  Oh, thank God we get back to the шир.  back today. Okay, terrific. Insert joke here. The handy's great in a pinch. Did I just hear 
[00:01:30]  that? Hello. Pull your pants down. You've got bad eyes. Number three. You're all burning  in hell. Damn you. Alcohol equals great radio. Are you not entertained? Making the first  amendment seem like a bad idea. This is the Opie and Anthony show. All right. Jane wants 
[00:02:00]  to get it in the... Whoa. What? Jane, what's going on? Hi, Jane. Well, my boyfriend wanted to  give it to me in the air. We heard somebody called up a couple weeks ago and said they  were going to do it and they backed out. Yeah. So I was wondering how legal is this? I mean, 
[00:02:30]  we can keep our language clean. I don't even know what she's talking about. Neither do I  and I see no problem with it. All right. Yeah, because we have no idea what you're talking  about. Yeah. Oh, I see. Yeah. Other end of this phone line here. Okay. But feel free.  We're playing. What is Jane doing? Uh, Jane? She's jogging around her neighborhood,  I believe. That must be it. Yeah. Get some bouncing going here. I should have worn a sports 
[00:03:00]  bra for this. We're just trying to figure out what's going on. We have no idea. I'm going  to guess, Anthony, that she's jogging around the block. I'm saying, um, wait, let's listen  a little longer. All right. Oh, I know. She's doing a Taibo. Taibo? Yeah. I'm thinking more  closer. I think she's more on the treadmill. Treadmill? Okay. Wow. Playing a new game. 
[00:03:30]  And guess what Jane's doing? Yeah. I'm not really sure. I think treadmill. You think  a treadmill? Because it sounded like she was moving a little bit. Mm-hmm. But she was  kind of in the same place. Yeah. And inside. Okay. I think she's trying some dessert. Maybe  possibly a new recipe. And it tastes very good. Yeah. Oh, my God. Okay. Really? What would 
[00:04:00]  Oh, my God mean? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Maybe she's praying. She's praying? At this  point. Yeah. Psycho Mark, do you know what she's doing? I think she's playing badminton.  Badminton? Badminton? Could be. Let's listen back again. Badminton. Let's see. Can I give  you a hint? No, no. We don't want any hints. No, no. Okay. You just keep playing whatever  you're playing. Yes. Let's play. Let's guess what Jane's doing right now. Hmm. Hmm. I think 
[00:04:30]  it's something. I think you're on the right track, Anna. Some type of exercise. I think  some type of exercise. Yeah. Badminton wasn't too far off. Oh, really? Yeah. Joe on line  10 wants to know if you're riding a horse. Um, um, well, if I say anything to that, I  think it'll give it away. All right. So, uh, oh, I know. Her. Wait a minute. Oh, sorry. 
[00:05:00]  You can't say that. You can't say that. What are you nuts? Oh, my God. All right. Well, I  did have to dump out of that. I'm sorry. I guess my guess was a little bold. Jose. Yeah. Yeah.  What's going on, ONA? What do you think? We're playing. What is Jane doing? Is she  fishing? I mean, does she catch a nice fish? Fish? Would you be that excited about  fishing? If it's a good thing. I mean, you go out there, you catch a barracuda or  something, you know, hey. A barracuda or a moray eel. Yes, exactly. Ah, maybe. Maybe she's 
[00:05:30]  running away from an alligator. I did hear an oh, my God. Now, that could happen. But then  again, you know, you get too close to the water. Something might jump out, try to bite you  or something. Right. Okay. Let's go back to Jane and see if we can guess what she's  doing here. Jane, we're still playing. I guess what Jane's doing. Are you in Lamaze  class? Nope. No. Are you in the privacy of your own home? Uh-huh. Okay. That's a good  hint, I believe, right there. Yeah, that like squeal, screamy thing. Oh, my God. Um, maybe 
[00:06:00]  she's, maybe she's, uh, watching some, uh, type of horror. A horror movie. Right. And  something just happened. Like Jason just, uh, laid the machete into the guy in the wheelchair.  Yes. Yes. Or something. Okay. Let me, uh. Hmm. Try to figure this out. Yeah. It's, it's very 
[00:06:30]  at home. She's at home. Maybe she's washing windows and they're real high up. And she's  just like, uh, you know, uh, trying to reach. Oh, I see. Okay. Okay. She seems to get  frightened a lot though. Yeah. The, oh my God and that half scream moan thing. I've seen  that in a horror film. Okay. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. She's, she's out of breath, 
[00:07:00]  Anthony. That's, yeah. That's, that's a big hint there. That is. And then the, uh, mm,  like mm, good. Mm, yeah. Mm, mm, good. Mm, mm, good. Mm, mm, good. Uh. Campbell's soup  is mm, mm, good, right? Uh, let's go to the phone. She's trying to put everything together,  all the pieces. Uh, Kevin, what's going on? Yo. Hey. Yeah. She's studying scripture. Can't  you tell she's being fulfilled? Yes. All right. Thank you, Kevin. Yeah. All right. Uh, Berga 
[00:07:30]  from New Rochelle writes, uh, what is she doing? I can't figure it out. This is a real  pain in the ass. Yeah. This is a pain. This is hard. I thought we'd get her, we're, we're  usually pretty observant. Um, Jane? Yeah. Hi. Hi. That was a good guess. Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh.  It was closer. Okay. Out of breath. Uh, you, uh, someone wants to ask, you're not playing  with your dog, right? No. Okay. No. Well, you, you could call. Never mind. Okay. Uh, 
[00:08:00]  Scott wants to know if you're using a Thighmaster. Um, you could call it that. Yeah? Yeah. Okay.  That's a good hint. Thighmaster. Okay. What's with the phone? Yeah, what's going on with the  phone? That's, that's a hint, too. Seems like the phone's moving around a lot and wrecking  up, uh, wrecking the, uh, reception. Oh? Oh? Oh? Steve from Jersey writes, she, she's 
[00:08:30]  running from the giant mosquito. You're not, you're not playing, uh, tennis by yourself.  How would I do that? Yeah. Well, like up against the wall and you got to run to that side and  then back to this side. Up against the wall is close. Up against the wall is close. You're  not in labor. John. Okay. John. Definitely not. How is your body positioned? Um, well, 
[00:09:00]  my, my chest is leaning up against the back of the chair and, uh, and my knees are on the  seat of a chair. Oh, okay. Leaning. All right. Back of the chair, seat of the chair, seat of  the chair. Some type of exercise. Yeah. Some type of apparatus. Yeah. Are you into yoga?  Not at the moment. No. Okay. Oh, God. Huh. Oh, God again. A little, more, more religion.  Oh. Hmm. I'm trying to think. Oh. Oh? Leaning, what would you do leaning up against a chair? 
[00:09:30]  Like this. A chair. And you're, what? You're like that. Jesus, Alfie, that's disturbing.  Why? You don't have to demonstrate. I'm trying to figure it out. Like this. You're like that.  Um, hmm. You sure she's like that? Or she isn't, um, with the knees on the floor? And  then the. Well, obviously she's using a chair to exercise. Punch her up. I got to see if  her knees are on the floor. Okay. Jane. Yeah. Are your knees on the floor? No, my knees 
[00:10:00]  are on the seat of the chair. On the seat of the chair. And my chest is pressed up against  the back of it. All right. Or the front of the back. Right. Right. Okay. I can't really  figure this out. This is a tough one. Like that guy said, this is a real pain in the  ass. Huh. Must be her last set. It's a little painful. Yeah. You know how you have to like  push that last set through the pain and stuff. Maybe she's playing a really good video game. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, yeah. Okay. Like Half-Life or something. Yeah. She could be playing Half-Life. When she's  running around the corners like in video game. Right. Yeah. Getting all excited. No, it  would have to be some type of car video game. Hmm. Let's, uh, let's go back to Jane. Oh, there  she is. Yes. Yes. Yes. Oh, God. More praying. She must be excited about her score in this video 
[00:11:00]  game. Yeah. No video games. No video games. No. Much more active. Much more active. Yeah.  Interesting. Interesting. Interesting. You're not, uh, pole vaulting, are you? No, my dad  would be able to hold this phone. Okay. Yeah. Pole vault. That was, I think, the closest 
[00:11:30]  one yet. Ah. Okay. Okay. All right. Getting closer. Uh, what else could we have her do,  auntie, to, to, to guess this? Jane, you still there? Yeah. Okay. What, what's going on  now? Uh, well, um, it's, uh, it's changed just a little bit and, uh, it's just gotten a little  bit more difficult and painful. She might have put more weight on the, the machine. Oh, I 
[00:12:00]  know what she's doing. She's, uh, she's working her biceps like this. Yeah. Right. She's got  a kneel on the seat. And she, and she put like more weight on and now it's getting painful.  And now she's like, yeah. Trying to curl. She's curling. Those heavyweights. Oh, my God.  Come on, you can do it. Come on. One more. Just a couple more. Oh, my God. Must be a tough 
[00:12:30]  stuff. Yeah. Glenn wants to know if she's making fudge. Well, we did say recipe. Uh,  Glenn. Yeah. Yeah. You, you think, uh, some type of recipe she's making fudge. Yeah. Something  like on a kitchen chair, making some fudge. Making fudge. Right. Well, maybe we should  ask, uh, Scott Muni what he thinks. Thank you. Thank you, Glenn. Uh, Mr. Muni, what, what  are you thinking here? We're trying to figure out what, uh, what Jane's doing on the other end  of the comment. Virgin. Virgin. I don't care. Okay. Virgin. Coming. Virgin. Virgin. Coming. 
[00:13:00]  Virgin. Virgin. Virgin. Virgin. Coming. Virgin. Coming. Okay. I think there's some type of clue  here. Coming. Coming. Coming. Okay. Okay. Hmm. Uh. Johnny from Jersey says, uh, I think 
[00:13:30]  she's going to see Hawaii or someone's going to see Hawaii. Maybe she's excited about a trip  to Hawaii. That could be, you know, or at least, uh, if not a trip, maybe they're going on a trip.  And, uh, she's maybe studying the math. Studying the math. Yeah. Uh, Jane. Yeah. How are you?  I'm doing good. Yeah. I know. Yeah. I know now. Okay. She's all out of breath. She went shopping, 
[00:14:00]  right? Right. And she took the groceries and tried to get in the front door. Yeah. It was  locked. Had to use the back door. Oh, I gotcha. But, but she didn't have the key. And neither  did, uh, the person she's with. So the person she's with is just pounding on the back door  the whole time trying, trying to get an answer. I think you're onto something, Anthony. She,  she sounds a little excited with your explanation. She was all out of breath, just holding the 
[00:14:30]  groceries while her boyfriend just pounding that back door. Right. And it looked like she was going  to drop the groceries. Right. Unless she unlocked that back door. Unless something happened with  that back door. Unless the back door opened up. We're still working on getting that back  door open. Yeah. Well, at least open all the way. Just pounding. We're starting to use the chair  against the door now. Okay. Coming. Coming. Virgin. Coming. Virgin. Coming. Yeah. Oh, my God. 
[00:15:00]  Just tell him keep pounding on that back door and, uh, someone will answer. Someone will, uh,  someone will come. You just, you keep, you, someone's got to answer the door eventually,  right? Man, those groceries must be getting heavy, huh? Okay. Terrific. Yeah. Virgin. Coming. 
[00:15:30]  Okay. Coming. Coming. All right. Um, Dan from Jersey writes, I think she's getting the same  treatment that ONA got from the IRS. Yeah. Okay. Oh. I thought our listeners were a little  more intelligent than this. I thought we could figure it out as a group what's going on on 
[00:16:00]  the other side of the phone there. Didn't seem that hard. I, I don't know. Should be easy,  but people are having a big problem figuring it out. Uh, okay. Uh, Jane, I, I, I guess  we're going to have to give up on you. I, I, no one got it. Oh, that's okay. It's over  now. It's over? Someone got it. Yeah. I got myself a new necklace. You got yourself a new  necklace? Oh. Well, you, oh, oh, so things, a couple of things might have changed during  the course of, uh, of your call. Um, yeah. A few things changed. Looks like the, the back 
[00:16:30]  door was opened, right? Indeed. And you received a, uh, a necklace. Yeah. Very good. For doing  such a good job. All right. Carrying the groceries in. That's what I meant, because she sounded  a little winded. Yeah. Wonderful. Coming. Coming. Coming. Virgin. Coming. Okay. All right,  Jane. Okay. Terrific. Thanks for playing, uh, What Is Jane Doing? All right. See ya. Bye. 
[00:17:00]  All right. That was a fun little game. New game on the Opie and Anthony show. I like that  game. Hello, America. Opie and Anthony want you to vote for boobs. Wait, wait a minute.  That, that can't be right. Vote now for your favorite WoW contestant on opieandanthony.com.  Then August 8th, Opie and Anthony will announce the top 20 finalists on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:17:30]  Go ahead and turn to Pompers and the top 20 finalists on the Opie.  Go ahead and turn to Pompers, who is your favorite WoW contestant on the Opie and Anthony show.  Go ahead and turn to Pompers. Oh, you gotta turn to Pompers. bitch.  We want to talk about the monkeys, though. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  Goddamn glowing monkeys.  Yeah, they got all dirty.  When we brought this up during commercials, he's like,  Yeah, B, I heard about that.  And we're like, just shut up.  Just shut up, all dirty, until we get on the air.  I've got to hear his comments about this genetic...  Oh, by the way, not to jump on the subject, but I did do some research,  and I found out why the government is actually behind the glow-in-the-dark monkeys. 
[00:18:30]  Why?  Because they figure it'll be easier to spot your television leaving your apartment at 3 o'clock in the morning.  Oh, my God!  All right.  What?  Wow.  Holy ass.  Oh, geez, leaving.  Oh, dirty, you better defend yourself.  I'm not talking about old dirty.  I was thinking the same...  No, wait a minute.  This was one possibility that I came up with.  You're seeing a conspiracy theory happening.  Oh, no doubt.  All right, old dirty... 
[00:19:00]  I love when old dirty turns into Mulder.  Wait, wait, wait.  We've got to give the details of the glowing monkey really well.  All right, yeah, absolutely.  Old dirty, you can talk for her as long as you want.  All right, here's some of the details.  Scientists actually modified the DNA of one of those cute little Reese's monkeys,  which are just put on this earth for us to F with,  and used some jellyfish DNA and put it into this monkey, a monkey egg, 
[00:19:30]  fertilized it, and implanted it into some monkeys.  They say...  Tyrone, sit down.  They say...  Oh, my God, old dirty.  Bring the bell.  They say it was done so they could better track some of these cells and DNA  in these animals to do medical research.  It's easier to see if they're glowing. 
[00:20:00]  But some of the side effects are, you know,  some of the stillborn fetuses and the fetuses they remove to do research on  before they're born have glow-in-the-dark hair and nails and whatnot.  They glow under certain lights and...  This is no doubt a conspiracy.  All right.  Coming down from the highest levels of the whole genetic manufacturing process.  Look at the way.  Look at the way Jamaican Mike's looking at him.  He's ready to hit you upside your head with his swing.  He'll pull that thing out like the Gallagher hammer. 
[00:20:30]  Smash your head.  Smash your head.  So how is this an X-Files-like conspiracy against minorities all dirty?  All right.  Let's say a brother gets caught.  Remember, allegedly, he's innocent before, you know, and all that.  Right.  Proven guilty.  You know, the process and all that.  That looks good on paper.  Right.  So let him know, Norton.  So then once they have sent a book and they give him a Kool-Aid,  inside this Kool-Aid will be the genetic material.  They can't resist Kool-Aid. 
[00:21:00]  Right?  Well, you got to eat a little something, right?  Am I right?  A little bologna and cheese.  You got to have your sugar water.  Before you know it, it's going to be turning up in mac and cheese.  You know what I'm saying?  So then you're going to make them drink this.  Yeah.  Drink.  And once they leave, they'll be tracking them from up top.  From satellites?  No, no, helicopters.  Because they ain't going to glow that much.  So you're saying that they're going to use this to track minorities.  Yes.  Unbeknownst to the individual. 
[00:21:30]  They don't have to do that to track minorities.  Control.  Code blue.  Code blue control.  He's on to us.  That's not true.  All they got to do is put some type of homing device in a white lady's purse.  Why would they want to?  Yeah, thanks, man.  That bell just...  Ow!  You can't hit that bell enough.  I know.  But why would they want to mess with the genetic material of a monkey and a jellyfish, dude?  They didn't feed the little monkey Kool-Aid, first of all.  It's a very involved process.  So they're talking about screwing with the eggs, the monkey eggs. 
[00:22:00]  Monkey eggs.  Jay, monkey eggs.  They're talking about screwing with monkey eggs before the monkey's born, obviously,  and then they implant them, and you have beautiful, beautiful monkeys that glow!  Glow!  Damn you glowing monkeys to hell!  If only Dr. Zayas glowed, I could have seen him riding up to that cave!  The gorillas wouldn't have taken me by surprise! 
[00:22:30]  Help me, Dr. Zayas!  Help me, Zira!  Cornelius!  That was a clever ruse I pulled on him!  It would better suit people to see monkeys now if they glow,  so that when they take charge in the future, like in Planet of the Apes,  I could see them in the dark!  Damn glowing monkeys!  Nova. 
[00:23:00]  Nova.  I taught you to glow.  Look at you.  Damn glow.  And then if they could genetically enhance monkeys like Zira,  to have puffy vag!  Oh, my God.  Puffy vag!  Glowing puffy vag!  I love it.  You ever see a big red mandrel ass?  Those big, like on the Discovery Channel,  where they have the baboon and monkey sitting in the tree with those big red asses hanging?  Imagine if they glowed! 
[00:23:30]  Like a homing device!  Glowing Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.  That's a goal of mine.  Oh, my God.  It gets a pup tint in my loincloth, doesn't it?  Glowing monkeys!  It's not a conspiracy, Old Dirty.  What is the, what's the, what's the, what's going on here?  The monkey and the jellyfish, my brother, what's going on with you?  So they can track cells.  Yeah, can't they track them now?  They're messing with the DNA so we could, like, figure out some of these diseases and stuff. 
[00:24:00]  Like Alzheimer's.  Yeah, let me tell you something.  Mike has a problem, I think.  Mike?  Yeah.  What's up?  How's it going, guys?  All right.  You guys are real.  I think you really should listen to O.D. because he's privy to militaristic information.  There you go, my brother.  Militaristic information.  Good job, O.D.  He's in your terminology.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  I don't know why, every, every time they try to come up with something, they're doing this,  making glowing monkeys, it's always for Alzheimer's.  And I think, I think Alzheimer's, I'm sorry, I'm going to get a lot of flack, but they should 
[00:24:30]  be put on the back burner.  Because what other disease can you just even forget you have?  It's not like you wake up, but cancer patients wake up and go, geez, I totally forgot I had  cancer today.  You know, work on that.  The Alzheimer's people, they don't even know.  They don't care.  It's the families that are crushed by it.  They keep loaning the same people money over and over.  Yo, let me tell you that, I think, I think they're closer to a cure.  They're just keeping it on the side so the pharmaceutical companies could keep making money, 
[00:25:00]  dude.  What, for Alzheimer's?  Yeah, for all them diseases, dude.  They got all the cures, man.  What's up?  I'm putting all my support behind the glowing monkey program, which will be used to shoot  Soviet missiles out of the sky.  We're going to fire glowing monkeys and disassemble the missiles that are inbound.  Isn't that what it's for, mommy?  Hello?  Hey, you were talking about cloning, Anthony.  I was.  Why are you calling me Anthony?  My name is Rutherford B. 
[00:25:30]  You have a problem with cloning.  I have a problem with the cloning.  Now they're cloning endangered species.  I saw this, this wacky, endangered, moose cow-like thing that is almost completely extinct.  So they, they cloned it using a cow to carry this altered embryo of this wacky, endangered  thing.  And it died after a couple of days.  Don't you think, that's us humans thinking we're so high and mighty that we're going  to bring back extinct, extinct species. 
[00:26:00]  You think God is looking down and going, no.  You're not effing with my word.  If this is supposed to be extinct, I got a reason for it.  And no people are going to help, help the cause.  That's why I'd like, if we're looking for dinosaur DNA, so we could get a few more of  those running around.  Like, it's bad enough when you park your goddamn car under a tree in the summer and it comes  out looking like Norton's bed.  You ever see that?  Could you imagine a goddamn, how much window washing you need to wash pterodactyl crap off 
[00:26:30]  your windshield?  You know if we could do it, there'd be dinosaurs chewing on the walls of some of the buildings  around here.  There's a reason.  Yeah.  Didn't you see, let me revert to Jurassic Park.  It's not supposed to happen.  Yo, that's right.  They're trying, though.  The manipulation of the genetic code is something.  That's my word, son.  That's only your word.  Yeah.  Because that's in no one else's dictionary.  Is that the Code 45 talking about? 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, right here.  Manipulation.  Yeah.  Courtesy.  Vinny the racist.  He dropped off that Code 45.  Yeah, but then Limo Ag, he cracks.  Man, I was going to, mmm.  Favorite beverage of all scientists.  How's he going to crack my 40 like that without permission, dude?  He should have called in advance if he was going to do something like that.  You think some of that glow gunks in there?  God, exactly.  Ah, they're putting in the Code 45.  Very good, Big Cat.  That's a vehicle for administering the glow-in-the-dark DNA, my brother.  There you go.  The brothers are also mad, some of the activists, that there's so many liquor stores and malt liquor in the neighborhoods. 
[00:27:30]  This is the dumping ground, my brother.  Where are you going to get rid of this stuff?  You ain't going to demand, my friend.  You ain't going to go to Scarsdale and sell a case of this at some, you know, some coffee club.  My God, lovey, I need some Cult 45.  Lovey, lovey, where's my cult?  No, Cult 45 is something they carry to keep black people out of those neighborhoods.  Somebody, I need, I don't need a bell. 
[00:28:00]  I need a...  Jim North.  I'm not saying it's right.  Don't bell me.  I'm reporting facts.  Voss is disgusted with you today.  No, he's not.  Listen to some of his material.  All right, we've got to take a quick break.  We'll be back.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We are having an absolute riot today.  Hope you're enjoying the festivities.  Yeah, sure.  Hoping a lot of people are joining the Tuesday Night Hummer Club right now, Ant. 
[00:28:30]  I would hope so, too.  Jeff, what's going on?  Hey, guys, how's it going?  All right.  I'm in the middle of being inducted into the Tuesday Night Hummer Club, as you speak.  Yeah!  Really?  Yeah.  Where are you?  I'm in Seaside Heights.  Are you on the road?  Oh, no.  I can't do that right now, at least.  No?  No, no.  I don't think there's anything wrong with that, though.  Let's talk to the lady real fast.  Okay, here.  Hi, guys.  Are you really inducting your boyfriend into the club tonight?  Yeah, I sure am. 
[00:29:00]  All right.  Hey, real quick.  Lick the mouthpiece on the phone.  Go ahead, real quick.  Oh, God.  Go ahead.  Now, give him back the phone.  Oh, no, no, no.  Okay, wait, wait, wait.  Yeah?  What's your name?  Kelly.  Kelly?  Yeah.  Can he hear us right now?  No.  Okay, listen.  Kelly.  Yeah?  We will give you a really good prize.  He can't hear, right?  No.  All right.  I want you to give him back the phone and go back into inducting him and just give him  a little bite.  Okay.  I'm serious.  If he screams, we're going to give you a really good prize. 
[00:29:30]  All right?  All right.  Not enough to really cause, you know, severe damage, but enough to get a reaction, okay?  All right.  All right.  Let's put Jeff on the line again.  Okay.  All right.  What the hell was that?  Oh, s***.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I had to jump out of that.  Don't curse.  Sorry about that.  She just bit him.  Jeff, what's wrong? 
[00:30:00]  Oh, man.  She bit me.  She bit me.  I'm sorry, but...  God damn, Opie, that's bad.  He's getting a kiss and made better now.  Man, that's not right, Opie.  She went right for it, though.  That's not bad.  That's real funny.  That's too good.  Hello, America. 
[00:30:30]  Opie and Anthony want you to vote for boobs.  Wait.  Wait a minute.  That can't be right.  Vote now for your favorite WOW contestant on opieandanthony.com.  Then August 8th, Opie and Anthony will announce the top 20 finalists on the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show, 1027, WNEW.  Wake up.  Wake up.  Drop, rest, and put on a little makeup.  I just have to fade away the sick up.  I just have to fade away the shit up.  Why'd you leave the keys up on the table?  Here you go, create another label.  You wanted to.  Drop, rest, and put on a little makeup. 
[00:31:00]  You wanted to.  I just have to fade away the sick up.  You wanted to.  Why'd you leave the keys up on the table?  You wanted to.  Why don't you trust me?  In my self-righteous suicide?  I'm crying when angels deserve to die.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, Jim?  How did I know that the judge who was going after these cops was a woman? 
[00:31:30]  How did I know it?  Making the cops identify themselves.  How did you know it was a chick?  Jim, Jim, we're not going to play that game.  We are.  We have something planned that we have to get to.  We promised the listeners.  What was it, though?  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  Concentrate.  It's out of the context.  Short-term memory.  What was it?  Look around.  Look around.  I feel like I'm living memento right now.  Do I have it tattooed on my arm somewhere?  Did you write it down? 
[00:32:00]  Did you take a picture of it?  Oh.  Oh.  Lots of notes around.  Sex for Sam 3.  Oh, we got to talk about that.  We got to get contestants.  Hotel Keys.  I think we did do that, right?  Talked about Hotel Keys?  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Top 25 funniest people.  Oh, what an awful list.  That wasn't it?  What an awful list.  That wasn't it?  I think it was.  Dude, tell Tommy Lee to call back because our listeners will hang us. 
[00:32:30]  They'll hang us today.  Oh, I got it.  Details Magazine.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  You're always making me forget that one.  I thought we had gotten to that weeks ago.  No.  No?  I have a pile of stuff on my desk.  Yeah.  I'm embarrassed.  Oh, stuff we've talked about.  I have an article on weird fetishes we never got to.  Oh, I don't remember that.  I got an article on the top 50 worst movies of all time. 
[00:33:00]  All this stuff that we're supposed to make for some good radio.  And I threw it all in the garbage.  Yeah.  I was too embarrassed to even bring it back up on the show.  Remember the what's your favorite ice cream thing?  I don't think that was us.  What are we, Howie Carr?  Yeah, Boston, there's one for you.  Okay.  Anthony, why it's okay to pay for sex.  Why it's okay to pay for sex. 
[00:33:30]  Right.  In a perfect relationship, the man never strays.  But who's perfect?  The next best thing to being faithful, a guy who admits to hiring hookers, Anthony.  Wow.  A lot of controversy with this article in Details Magazine.  Yes, Jim Norton.  You're saying it just seems like you have a real catch in your studio and you didn't know it.  The next best thing to being faithful.  The next best thing to being faithful.  I reported that article, and I agree.  Is paying for it?  Yep.  I agree.  Hmm. 
[00:34:00]  Let me read a little further.  All right.  A real catch.  Let me begin by stating I wouldn't dream of paying for sex.  Never have, never will.  The thought of $120 worth of gentleman's relief at the local Thai massage parlor.  Are the Thais doing the massages these days?  I wouldn't know, and I never paid $120.  That's too obscure a number.  Unless it's before four on Sunday, in which case it's $92.50.  Oh.  This guy's a riot. 
[00:34:30]  Boy, we could only dream we could write for Details Magazine.  In which case it's $92.50.  Disgust me.  Nevertheless, I have a very close friend who's indulged once or thrice.  Thrice meaning three times.  And I'd like you to consider the possibility that he isn't a complete loser.  Maybe, just maybe, paying for a piece isn't as morally reprehensible as Lynn Cheney would have us believe. 
[00:35:00]  Who's paid in here?  We know Norton.  I've never paid.  Anyone ever in your history of...  You're paying right now.  Rick shows his wedding ring and says you're paying right now.  I've never paid either.  Never paid.  I never paid either.  I never paid because I always had a radio show.  I was...  You don't need to pay because you have a big, delicious Italian mule.  I was just always petrified.  I know he's paid.  You have to.  Anyone that looks like Curious George has to have paid for sex. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Jeez.  Wow.  Can you turn around the phone screens because our ass-wipe listeners are trying to distract us.  We've got to get to this today.  All right.  As Xaviera Hollander, remember her?  The Happy Hooker?  Xaviera Hollander, yes.  Pointed out in The Happy Hooker,  hiring a prostitute isn't all that different from stumbling through the dating maze.  It's just a shortcut to getting the cheese.  Now, you know something?  That is the thing I read that was like,  okay, I see that point. 
[00:36:00]  Like, if you're not in a serious relationship and you're dating,  you're paying for what amounts to sex.  You're not looking for a relationship.  You want to get laid.  You go out.  You're going to be spending money.  It's just going to food or movies or a play or whatever the hell you're doing.  You're paying money in exchange for sex, and it's not even guaranteed.  You're paying for the pre-show when you just want to get to the game.  Right. 
[00:36:30]  In both cases, you're spending money to avoid having to do your own handiwork.  There you go.  Okay.  Indeed, Hollander argues that the covenant between Working Girl and John is more honest.  Neither party has to pretend it's about anything other than sex when you go to a hooker.  Or as Charlie Sheen put it, this is a great line, you're not paying them to sleep with you.  You're paying them to leave.  To leave.  That's when you're Charlie Sheen.  When you're any one of us, you're paying for them to sleep with you.  That's really easy to say when you're a good-looking guy who starred in Platoon and Wall Street. 
[00:37:00]  But girls who are with me want to leave.  Idiot Charlie Sheen.  As quickly as possible.  Yeah, like we all have that problem.  Well, you know, the model didn't want to get out of my apartment.  Jim, you're out of your mind.  No, I'm not.  You've never been with a girl.  Of course I have.  And you just wanted to have sex.  Absolutely.  And she was still there.  And you were trying to figure out how to get her out.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm just saying that I pay for sex.  It's not like I have the option to get laid whenever I absolutely want to get laid.  Right. 
[00:37:30]  Okay.  Let me tell you something that a lot of people might not know.  One of the highs in getting escorts, it's not necessarily the act or the finishing.  The high is this.  It's that knock at the door.  The risky business knock.  It's the looking through the keyhole.  When I was...  Oh, you can't...  Wait a minute.  Because now this is intriguing.  This is...  And then do you all of a sudden go like, oh, oh. 
[00:38:00]  It's here.  There's a woman there who will have sex with me and she's a stranger.  And it's the look.  What does she look like?  Hold on.  It's the look of the keyhole.  Once again, I could completely...  Wow.  I am so with you.  Look at Jimmy.  No, I am so with him again because Risky Business, when we were growing up, that movie was kind  of popular.  Oh, but look what came to the door first.  You're so right.  But it was that whole, oh my God, sex has arrived at my door.  They walk in.  They're wearing a skirt.  They sit down in the bed.  They usually have to call the agency. 
[00:38:30]  But you know, as long as you're not a complete pig, hey, how are you?  It's okay to rub the leg.  I mean, you don't go to be becoming a pig because they have to make sure...  So you step right up and like, hey, how are you doing?  I know.  Hey, come on in.  I'm very cool.  I know.  But I know I can touch them.  I know that I'm looking at that beautiful body and those great legs and that beautiful  ass and I want to touch it.  I can.  It's okay.  I love that.  Holy Jesus.  It's not just about the sex.  It's about the control you get with it.  And I'm not an abusive...  I don't beat up on it.  I mean, I'm into...  Right, right.  I'm actually a pretty easy date when it comes to that stuff.  You hit on something because the whole Risky Business scene, yeah, it turned out to 
[00:39:00]  be a disaster, but when all of a sudden the ding dong and he was all alone, his parents  were away for the weekend, that was like a major turn on for me checking out that scene  until it was that horrific sight.  It's the complete lack of being self-conscious.  It's about taking over your shirt and not caring what your body looks like because you  know she's beautiful, but it doesn't matter because the arrangement is money equals this.  The arrangement's been fixed, so all this stuff is okay.  That's what that's about.  It's not just... 
[00:39:30]  I mean, if you want to get what you want to get, that's part of it.  It's not just part of it, but it's certainly not all of it.  So you're all like...  You hear the knock and you go like, oh, here it is.  Here it is.  Yeah, because you're pacing, dude.  Do you savor that moment?  Yes.  Do you do it slow and walk to the door and go, okay, what's this going to be like?  Who is she going to...  I shower first, especially in hotels on the road, man.  It's kind of like opening up a birthday present from grandma.  You just don't know what you're going to get.  Dude, what does she look like?  Look through the door.  That woman is here to have sex with me for what I have in my pocket, which is money. 
[00:40:00]  And I'll give it to her.  If you're on hold, stay there, but we've got to go right to the hotline.  A guy that might know a little bit about hookers, Tommy Lee.  Tommy.  Tommy!  Who, me?  Yeah.  Mr. Lee.  What's up, Tommy?  What's up, guys?  No, we were just talking to everybody about paying for it.  I know.  I heard the conversation.  Yeah, escorts and hookers and stuff.  I have to assume you've done that a couple of times, at least. 
[00:40:30]  I think everyone should own one.  Yeah?  Yeah.  When you're Tommy Lee, you don't have to, though.  Yeah, see, that's just it.  You go out, you pick up some chick.  He's a rock star, and he has a mule the size of a small community.  Everyone knows about that.  Everyone's seen that on the tape.  Yeah, that made for some great Thanksgiving viewing, Tommy.  I'm so glad that we get to talk to you today, because I've always wanted to thank you.  We brought that tape to Thanksgiving dinner, swear to God, and watched it upstairs while  Mom and Sis and the aunts were cooking the turkey. 
[00:41:00]  We all went upstairs to see you rail, Pam.  You pervert.  You pervert.  You know something, though?  You're lucky.  Hey, you're lucky that you were endowed like that, because it was a big hit.  People saw the tape and went, wow, look at Tommy Lee's hog.  And you could have been one of those guys, a little puny thing, and then you'd be going  through life embarrassed.  Yeah.  Okay.  You've got to be psyched at that gun out there. 
[00:41:30]  Who are you kidding?  Hell yeah.  If I've got a 14-incher, I want the world to know.  I'd be happy with six.  Hey, Tommy, I've got to ask you.  I saw Pam on, what the hell was she on last night?  CNN.  Larry King.  Larry King.  Why are we even talking about the P word?  Because she was claiming...  I've got to go, guys.  Bye.  Are you kidding?  Are you kidding?  He hangs up for talking about Pam?  What a faggot.  What a dick.  All right, Tommy Lee, officially an asswipe. 
[00:42:00]  Why would he hang up?  Why would he hang up?  You were tooling her, you idiot.  It got out of video.  You were married.  No one doesn't know.  Why are we bringing up the P word?  He wants to promote some golf tournament.  Wow, that's exciting, radio.  Let's talk about a golf tournament.  Want to talk about her and her goddamn hep?  And the fact that she says Tommy gave it to him?  What is wrong with these people?  Did Tommy Lee lose his mind?  I didn't see if you were being nasty. 
[00:42:30]  Did he lose his friggin' mind?  He wasn't even happy that we brought up the sex tape.  I was complimenting the guys.  I gotta go.  Then go.  Go F yourself.  I have a sense of humor about it.  You jack off.  Like, anyone wants to hear about anything else that you're doing.  By the way.  You're not exactly at the peak of your music career right now.  We want to talk about the sex you had.  We want to talk about the hep C.  The hep thing, Pam.  Does she have a big C?  The interesting stuff.  Not a golf tournament and your latest CD. 
[00:43:00]  Want to ask why you didn't have a lifeguard at the party?  We'll plug your crap.  We'll plug it.  Yeah.  Why don't you stick that mammoth mule in the pool and let the kid climb out on it?  Come on.  Why are we going to sit there and plug stuff and not get something that would be worthwhile for this program?  Like, talk about Pam.  He should have used his schlong to separate the shallow end from the deep end in the pool.  Like that thing they put across the pool. 
[00:43:30]  When you hit the throbbing vein, turn back, children.  Oh, my God.  I'm glad this happened today.  It's a perfect example why.  Because a lot of people ask us, a lot of journalists ask us, a lot of listeners,  why you guys don't have more famous people on the show.  That's why.  That's why.  They all have major attitudes.  And they got an agenda.  Well, yeah, they could come on your show, but they will only talk about a stupid golf tournament.  And nobody was being a dick to them. 
[00:44:00]  Like, you weren't saying anything messed up about Pam Anderson.  I just wanted to talk about Pam.  And I saw her on Larry King.  And I wanted to comment on the hepatitis thing.  Hey, I got to go.  I got to go.  Obviously, you're not going to rescue children, are you?  Well, he was being a dick.  He was just a dick.  That's not cool rocker.  Hey, here's my crib.  Hey, here's where my dogs hang out.  Yeah, my dog.  That wasn't cool rocker.  That was uptight asswipe that doesn't want to talk about anything that anyone wants to hear about. 
[00:44:30]  He wants to plug stuff and get off.  Well, it don't work that way on this show.  No, it does not work that way.  Give and take, it's called.  We used to play that game, and we gave our listeners horrible radio.  Horrible effing radio.  Nothing more.  Hey, why are we bringing up the P word?  No more.  Oh, God disgusts me.  Another rock hero gone.  Gone.  Ugh.  That's why. 
[00:45:00]  You know something?  I'd rather have cool guys on the way up on this program.  We got, like, when Andrew WK sits in, he'll talk about anything.  You know something?  Has the guy sold as many albums as Motley Crue has?  No.  He's on his way up.  He's a cool, regular guy.  Tommy Lee, been through the mill, been at the top of the friggin' rock heap, back down on the downside of the slide,  and you'd think he'd have something to talk about.  There's only been books written about their sex lives and the debauchery that the Crue's been through. 
[00:45:30]  It's known, Tommy.  You went out with Pam.  You were married to the woman.  You had kids with her.  What is it, a secret?  That's all in the book.  All of a sudden, we can't talk about Pam Anderson?  These celebrities are delusional.  They are effing delusional.  Why do you think you're coming on a nationally syndicated radio show to talk about a stupid golf tournament?  There are golf tournaments every day, these celebrity golf tournaments.  And if he would have talked with us, we'd have plugged it like we gave a flying F, too.  We would have given it a good plug. 
[00:46:00]  It would have sounded sincere.  Boy, what a surprise we bring up Pam when she was on Larry King last night.  Last night.  It wasn't like it happened two months ago.  She was blaming you for the hep.  I'd like to go to the horse's mouth and hear the answer, but instead we got the horse's ass.  Tommy Lee.  Wow, Tommy, you're real brave.  What a rocker.  When he said, I'm out of here, I thought...  Woo, what a rocker.  I thought he was...  Suck it.  I thought he was kidding when he said, I'm out of here.  I thought he was kidding. 
[00:46:30]  So did I.  I thought he was kidding.  Oh, yeah, Vince and Nicky, much cooler.  When they hung out, they were talking.  They were talking about the past and their sex lives and everything.  They talked for like two and a half hours.  They answered every single question we threw at them.  Every single one.  Talked about Nicky getting thrown into a dumpster because they thought he was dead after he OD'd.  He told the whole story.  Yeah.  I think it was in Japan or something.  He OD'd.  And the people that were doing the drugs with him were like, holy S, we just killed a rock star. 
[00:47:00]  We got to get rid of him.  Threw him in a dumpster.  All the sex stories.  And also he woke up.  You got to mention the tape, though.  You have to.  It's a very famous porno.  The tape is famous.  He might be tired of talking about it.  But you know something?  People still want to hear from him about it.  It's part of, you know, doing what you do, Tommy.  It's part of getting your plugs out.  You got to give a little something first.  I'm not going to sit here.  We're not going to sit here and kiss your ass.  If my wife was accusing me of giving her hep. 
[00:47:30]  Ex-wife.  Ex-wife.  I would absolutely talk about it.  And Ant wasn't married to another celebrity who was being interviewed on Ash.  No teller.  Yeah.  Well, it's still.  And I've talked about it plenty of times on this show.  Going into a situation like that, you're prepared.  You know they're going to be asking questions.  Every time we sit down to do an interview with one of these magazines or a paper or something  or Bill O'Reilly, we know some of the questions are going to be a little uncomfortable.  I know those Olsen twins questions are coming.  I'll answer them.  So you decide, all right, do I want to put myself through this? 
[00:48:00]  I talked about the goddamn $300 engagement ring.  I talked about the hell night that was my wedding.  Rick, call him back.  Call him back.  Or the publicist or whatever.  Call him back.  We had a real good discussion about prostitutes.  If I had a good chance to clear my name and go, no, that's not true, that's not true,  I would certainly do it.  I mean, I don't understand why somebody wouldn't want to do that.  We got more out of Pantera, Phil, and he was inebriated.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That guy's a rock star. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, I want to drink the green beers.  Get me a green beer and cigarettes.  And methadone.  I need methadone.  Shut up.  Shut up.  He was great.  Hold on.  Shut up.  What?  What?  Yeah, what?  15 years old, I burnt my parents' house down.  I don't want to get into it.  I plead the fifth.  He's a rock star. 
[00:49:00]  You're not scared of death?  No, not at all.  It's so overrated, you know.  I've died a bunch of times.  He's deaf.  Tommy.  Yeah.  Tommy.  What's up, man?  Hey, why you guys call me a dick, dude?  What's up?  What's up?  Because you called up, like, we want to talk to you about a little bit of everything, and  you hung up.  You know what?  You hold on.  You were told not to bring up the peanuts. 
[00:49:30]  What do you do?  No one told us anything.  Hey, Tommy, no one tells us what to do, first of all.  What's that?  No one tells us what to do.  No one told us not to bring up Pam's name.  We would never agree to that, okay?  Yes, you were.  You were the big pussy for hanging up after we asked about it instead of trying to talk  your way out of it.  You guys did agree to it.  We did not!  My tour manager talked to your producer.  That's bull****.  Nope.  Nope.  We would never agree to that.  Sorry.  That's kind of a big story that we wanted to hear about. 
[00:50:00]  You know what, guys?  What year are you guys living in?  It's like, dude, turn the page, guys.  I've been divorced for three years.  Turn the page.  Turn the page.  It was big news last night when she was on Larry King accusing you of this.  Don't you think it's a current story if Pam is on Larry King saying pretty much that you  gave her hep C?  What was big news, guys?  What was big news?  Big news that she's on Larry King accusing you of giving her hep C. 
[00:50:30]  Dude, you know how many months ago she accused me of that?  It doesn't matter.  It happened last night on Larry King.  Of course we're going to bring it up.  She talked about it last night.  You know what?  She talked about it in some other stupid magazines as well.  Who cares?  Yeah, but this is the first time we're talking to you, so we'd like to, you know, maybe talk  to you about it.  Maybe get your side of the story.  You've never really given your side of the story, right?  You know why?  Why?  Because it's nobody's business.  Well, she's made it everyone's business.  Of course she is. 
[00:51:00]  She's an idiot.  I would just love to hear your side of it.  If an ex is accusing me of some crazy things, you know what?  I'm going on the biggest program I can find and then calling her a liar, a C, a twat.  Every name I can figure out.  Guys, I don't do that.  That's not my style, okay?  I don't do that crap.  That's why I just hung up the phone.  I was like, you know what?  I got to go.  Because that's not my style, guys.  It may be your style, but it ain't mine.  But you look like a pussy just hanging up.  We were totally confused.  You didn't even say the first time you're on the phone, hey, guys, I thought we 
[00:51:30]  agreed to this.  You know what?  I'm telling you man to man that he never got to us that we couldn't talk about Pim.  Because you know what?  We wouldn't have agreed to this interview.  You call me a pussy, I'm hanging up.  Pussy.  Wow.  We need Tommy Lee to make a good radio show.  If you say that, I'll take my ball and not play.  I know, man.  You know.  He don't want to talk about it. 
[00:52:00]  Never agreed to it.  He don't want to talk about it.  Rick, did somebody tell you?  Maybe Ben.  Maybe Ben the producer.  Ben the producer.  Well, page six did say Ben is the producer of this program.  When I talk to their guy, they just ask, well, you know, just try not to dwell on it.  It'll probably come up.  And I'm like, yeah, it'll probably come up.  But, you know, he goes, as long as you talk about the music and the tour and he's doing this  golf thing, I'm like, yeah, we got all that on the paper right there.  I'm very open-minded.  Let me tell you something.  If we started talking about it and he just told us what he told us there, look, this is 
[00:52:30]  what she's saying.  I don't like going in that direction.  To me, it's old news.  I'd rather just not really get into it.  It would have been like, all right, that's pretty much his side of it.  If he doesn't want to dwell on it.  And us being us, we might poke at it a little more and make a goof about it.  I'm sure Jim will say some tasteless thing into the mic about it.  But you know something?  He didn't.  He just hung up and it was like, what's he doing?  You call me a pussy, I'm hanging up.  Oh, boy, Tommy, we really need you for our radio show. 
[00:53:00]  And last week when I talked to the guy about it, the Pam Anderson, Larry King thing didn't  even happen.  So who knew it would be one of the things that's on everybody's mind today?  Jersey Bob here says, if I type in pussy, he'll disconnect from the internet.  Wait a minute.  There you go, Jersey Bob.  You were told.  You were told.  I'm told.  Tommy, maybe you should do your research on Ant and I.  No one tells us what to do.  We don't like being told things.  Believe me. 
[00:53:30]  You've been told enough.  You see the hesitation?  He's like, oh, my God, he called me a pussy.  Now I've got to hang up.  No one else told that.  All of a sudden he goes, you call me a pussy, I'm hanging up.  Pussy.  And all of a sudden I'm just looking and you know he was confused.  He's like, oh, ass.  Now I've got to hang up.  I called him out on it.  You should have told him I will not have an ultimatum put to me.  It was that delayed.  Oh, brother.  Wow.  Now I've got to hang up and I really need to promote this new CD.  Now what do I do?  Well, I guess I've got to hang up. 
[00:54:00]  He's living in a bubble.  You know what I mean?  He says, what year are you living in?  That was three years ago.  No, it's still, like Ope said, when you see her on Larry King the night before talking about it,  you would think, all right, for our side alone, just for this radio,  it would be interesting to hear his rebuttal on the whole thing.  So we're obligated to ask.  Even if his rebuttal is, I don't want to talk about it, that's not how I do things, that's fine. 
[00:54:30]  That's fine.  Then we get into other things.  He's talking like this Larry King interview happened six months ago.  Yeah, we talk about the Motley Crue days.  You were told.  Plenty of other things to talk about.  You were told.  Go F yourself.  Told.  E, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, Ope?  Ope, I want to congratulate you on your new balls.  Why are my new ones?  I don't know, man.  And I'm a little disappointed in you, man.  What?  When he hung up the first time, you were digging into him, man.  Then he called back.  The guy should have fired right at him, man. 
[00:55:00]  Dude, listen to me on this.  First of all, it's the Ope and Anthony show, and I went.  Yeah, you're right.  That's all that is.  If I didn't go, I guarantee my pal here Ant was going.  You know what makes good radio?  Yes, I beat him to the punch because we were both to the point we had it.  You know what makes good radio?  Two people not yelling over each other, especially when a third is on the phone.  What we identify and know what to do, when one person's speaking, the other person has  to back off because you don't want to hear this.  Go ahead, Ope.  Just say anything.  Hey, Tommy.  What the hell is it? 
[00:55:30]  You know something?  You don't want to talk about anything.  All righty.  Thanks.  You were told not to call this program with those words.  He could have even said pending litigation.  Perhaps that would have, you know, okay.  And use that one.  Pending litigation.  Well, for you, when I was trying to, because I had a job to do when you were going through  your mess.  I was prying you to see how far I could get you to go.  And on the air, I would say, because it's true, it was, you know, pending litigation.  Perhaps there's some kind of lawsuits being filed that he can't talk about. 
[00:56:00]  I don't know, unless he tells us, you know, what do we know?  We're going to talk about it.  The guy doesn't understand that after Motley Crue, the biggest thing he's known for is  a porno movie with his ex-wife, Pamela.  That's the biggest goddamn thing.  Hey, here's some excitement.  Tommy Lee.  Never a dull moment.  The name of the new CD.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jesus.  Hello, America.  Opie and Anthony want you to vote for boobs. 
[00:56:30]  Wait.  Wait a minute.  That can't be right.  Vote now for your favorite WoW contestant on OpieandAnthony.com.  Then August 8th, Opie and Anthony will announce the top 20 finalists on the Opie and Anthony  show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Wheelchair Fred was on hold, Anthony.  He's got problems with the show.  What now?  I don't know.  I don't know where he went.  Maybe he'll call back.  I hate those blood.  He wants money.  He doesn't want us to call him gay anymore.  He's not gay. 
[00:57:00]  He's desperate.  That's right.  That's what he says.  He can't feel anything from his waist down.  So if you flip him over and hit him in the turd cutter, he can't feel it anyway.  I mean, you stretch him out like an old raincoat.  It doesn't mean anything.  He's fine with it.  He should be a little more giving like that.  By the way, the guy with the awful voice is Jimmy Schubert.  For a guy who sounds like he gargles with gravel, that would be Schubert.  Here's Wheelchair Fred, Jimmy.  Listen to his voice.  Freddie.  Yeah.  How you doing, man?  I'm a big girl. 
[00:57:30]  I'm a big girl.  Hey, Norton.  Norton, he's saying hey.  Hey, Norton.  Hello, Fred.  I don't know.  This is Jakey.  Come on down.  What?  All right.  I didn't catch that one.  This is Jakey.  Come on down.  Right.  Wheelchair Fred.  You have a problem with people saying that you go with guys? 
[00:58:00]  No.  Can you tell Schubert this story?  I just love this story.  What?  You don't want to tell me?  No, no.  Here.  I'll just, I'll run through it quickly.  Yeah.  If Fred tells him I'm going to need a wake-up call, let's cut to the chase.  Well, I could, the guy, oh yeah, it is a long story now that I think about it.  He had a motorcycle accident.  Right.  He ended up in a wheelchair, not because he's paralyzed, but the doctors really effed his  legs up, so his legs aren't functional.  He can still feel his legs.  His spine is a little screwy, too. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, a little bit, but not that bad.  And his voice box obviously crushed.  His voice box was crushed, so he can't talk.  But he's still there.  But, yeah, his mind is fine.  He just cannot communicate with people.  What kind of a hell is that talking about?  Yeah, that is a hell, you know.  So, he has trouble getting girls now because he's in the wheelchair.  He talks like that.  Everyone thinks he's retarded.  So, he went so long without getting laid, he opened up his options a little bit and said,  all right, if guys want to have sex with me, that's fine. 
[00:59:00]  Well, see, that's the thing.  See, guys will have sex with anything.  Right.  I've been with some guys in the condo that they'll hump a sofa down the hallway at 3 o'clock in  the morning.  Right.  They're all gacked out and drunk.  So, he opened up his options.  But he says...  He picks up a guy.  He says he's not gay.  He does.  He wants everyone to know, I'm not gay, I'm just desperate.  So, he picked up a guy.  A young fella.  Actually, the guy picked him up.  Yeah, yeah.  I guess that has to happen.  Yeah.  He picked up a young fella.  A young fella of 18.  18 or 19, yeah. 
[00:59:30]  Nice, virile young buck.  Irish boy, I remember.  Oh, yes.  An Irish boy.  And the kid flipped him over and hit him right in a spider bite.  What?  No.  He got him, I guess, leaning against his bed post.  Well, the pickup was the best because he wheeled past the deli and the kids were hanging out  and Fred comes wheeling up.  Oh, because it was an ad in a magazine.  Right.  He took out an ad in the personal and was like, okay, so they hooked up and they said  they were going to meet at the deli. 
[01:00:00]  So, Fred's wheeled up to the deli and the young buck comes walking by and there's no  mistake in Fred.  In his tight jeans.  In his tight pants.  With his banana poking through.  Did you go to your place, Fred?  Yeah, of course.  I'm right here.  Right.  They went to his place.  I don't know what the hell he said.  Okay.  It's two yards away.  And then he bent him over.  He bent Fred over.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:00:30]  And had his way with Fred.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then Fred said, and Fred, a direct quote goes, ah, what the hell?  Yeah.  He goes, well, you know, ah, what the hell?  Well, so he proceeded to return the favor to the guy, I guess, with your face?  No, he, you went.  No, I didn't like the booty.  Him in the booty.  In the booty.  In the booty.  Did he sit on your lap in the wheelchair? 
[01:01:00]  He held on to the bedpost, remember?  Oh, so that was when the kid was getting it?  Yeah.  Oh, he's paying over the bedpost.  And Fred.  No, apparently, Fred, he gutted the guy like a pumpkin.  He had little specks of corn and stuff.  He had to knock out of his Johnson stuff.  I do gutted the kid.  So he was all shaky, he was all shaky, holding on with one arm with the bedpost.  Just kind of shaking with all the strength he has in his upper body to hold himself up.  As he was getting the job done.  As he was, yeah, laying some pipe, as they say. 
[01:01:30]  But now Fred doesn't like us exploiting that on the show, I guess.  You don't want people to think you're gay, right, Fred?  No.  The problem was something that I grabbed young boys.  Hey, you sound like a Catholic priest.  What did you go to?  Our Lady in Glory Hall?  What's this guy's story?  I heard little boys is all I heard.  Yeah.  Yeah, Fred.  He said three Hail Marys and an R5.  Yeah, dirty, filthy little Raisin Hall. 
[01:02:00]  Bring it over here and let Father wash it out with the bar of soap.  Let me go over here and touch it.  You've been a sinner here.  Dirty little sinner.  You want somebody of good?  Get over here and step in the confessional.  You've been a bad little boy.  Get over here and say your forgiveness.  That's right.  Say it, sonny.  Say it.  Welcome to Our Lady of the Glory Hall.  Freddie.  Yeah.  One more time.  What did you say?  Your intern said I like boys. 
[01:02:30]  Your, where, where, where, what?  Your intern.  Oh, our intern.  He likes to intern little boys.  I like little boys.  He said you like little boys.  Wait, Stinky's coming in here.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  Something's going on here because Stinky just walked in with the biggest smile and he's not  even high.  What is going on with real tear, Fred?  During the break, Ben picked him up to tell him we had to leave, but he asked him a few  questions before, Ben. 
[01:03:00]  Ah.  And what was...  Yeah, Ben was his name.  And what was one of the questions, Fred?  You're my good boy.  And what did you say?  No way, Ben.  And I took offense to that.  My son, I couldn't take it.  He bent over for an 18-year-old drunken Irish kid, yet he takes offense to what Ben said.  Yeah, well, this guy ought to be careful because people are just going to start throwing him  out of the wheelchair and hitting him right in the raisin hole because who the hell is  he going to tell?  Who's going to find out about it? 
[01:03:30]  I was ready for...  There were 20 of them.  There were 20 of them.  They put it right in my corn chute.  Yeah, but you do what you have to do.  You do what you have to do.  Okay.  That's my life.  Fred, you aren't giving oral treats right now, are you?  No, I'm not.  You're actually doing a movie about this guy.  Okay, my left anus. 
[01:04:00]  That's my left anus.  That's right.  So, Fred, I guess, have you got any girls, though, lately?  That's the last century.  What?  That's the last century.  That's since the last century.  This ought to be a game show.  Figure out what he's trying to say.  What's he saying?  Who can complete the sentence?  We used to play...  I'm reading my head and what Fred said.  We used to play, you know, what is Fred saying.  We might have to bring that back.  Yeah.  Because I'm finding him very hard to understand today. 
[01:04:30]  How would you get...  I have a call or something.  All right.  So, what's your problems with the show, Fred?  You don't want to say that you're gay anymore, right?  There's no problem with that, but I don't want you to say, like, boys.  All right.  We won't say...  Little boys.  Well, 18 is your limit, right?  Yeah.  Fred, how old are you?  I'm 38.  All right.  38.  So, if you had sex with an 18-year-old kid, that's a little boy, as far as looking at it. 
[01:05:00]  You're right.  Okay.  You're right.  So, I think Ben is quite accurate by asking you.  I was 36 at the time.  You were 36 at the time.  Okay.  When was the last time he had a guy?  When was the last time he was like...  Kyle, we have to have him sing some Louis Armstrong.  I hear him.  What was that one song?  What was that one song?  Beautiful.  What a beautiful...  This guy in Ozzy Osbourne should play Password. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, really?  That is funny.  I'd like to buy a vowel.  You've got to sing some Louis Armstrong, Fred.  Do you know any Louis Armstrong?  Do you know any Louis Armstrong?  Get some oxygen.  That's Jimmy Durante.  Yeah. 
[01:06:00]  Ah-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha.  That's right.  You knew what he was saying.  That's right.  I used to listen to Jimmy Durante.  I read the book of the week.  I read the book of the day.  I read the book of the hour.  I read the book of the...  Ah-cha-cha-cha.  Good night, Miss Cat.  Ah-cha-cha-cha.  Wherever you are.  Yeah.  Freddie.  Yeah.  You've got to sing some Louis Armstrong for us today.  I have a song, I think.  You'd have to think?  Yeah, I don't think he knows.  I don't think he knows what Louis Armstrong sings.  Do we have What a Wonderful World anywhere? 
[01:06:30]  You know what that is?  Ghost soundtrack.  I don't know what it is.  You can call this, you want to pick it up.  It was on the Good Morning Vietnam soundtrack.  Oh, we got that one, I think.  Do we?  I think we have that one.  Yeah.  Earl would know if he was there.  All right, Freddy, so we'll stay away from the gay thing,  even though we still want to play your clip.  I'm not gay.  I'm desperate.  That's cool.  That's what he says.  All right.  I'd call him a CS-er, but I know he's trying to quit. 
[01:07:00]  And also, I'm here, and you want us to send you money, right?  That'd be nice.  But do you want us to go down to the brewery?  Do I?  Oh, down to the brewery after we do Sex for Sam,  when we go to the Sam Adams Brewery?  Yeah, let me get down.  You won't be too annoying.  You won't go to try to sit on any bottles, will you?  No, thank you.  No?  Hey, who are you kidding?  This guy could do deep knee bends over a fire hydrant.  He can't feel it anyway.  Hey.  The thing that I can't feel, I have full sensation down there. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, you have full sensation down there?  Yeah, this guy's leather Cheerio and his baseball hat are the same size.  Oh, I don't know what that was.  Hey, Freddie.  You know what's a shame?  Hopefully, the dumb guy doesn't speak retard.  I'm not retarded.  I just saw something very thirsty.  I can't read your email, oh, please.  What?  He reads your email. 
[01:08:00]  I love you.  I try to read your email, but it seems like you're writing your email with the palms of  your hands.  He actually, he talks the same way he types.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I want to thank you all before my name.  What?  You made the name Wheelchair Fred.  He's thanking you for calling him Wheelchair Fred.  Right.  Yeah, I named you many years ago, Fred.  Yeah, but I... 
[01:08:30]  Thank God he wasn't a black guy named Norman.  All right, Fred.  I don't know what to do with you.  A lot of people are suggesting we get you a hooker.  We could do that.  Oh, thank you.  I said we'd get him a maverdite.  Let's go to the extra nine yards, just in case.  Can we sneak a hooker into the St. Adam's Brewery?  Sure.  Now, after you just said it?  No, hypothetically.  If we ever really wanted to.  Hey, Freddy, we're going to get a young stud for you. 
[01:09:00]  Maybe I'd rather have a couple.  Would you rather have a guy or a girl?  Both of us and couple.  Both at one time, he said.  Don't be greedy.  Mike has a great idea on line 11.  Mike, go ahead.  Yeah, I think for 6% 3, you should give a sign of 20-point value to have sex right on Fred's lap.  Oh, man.  We should have Fred just kind of hanging around the area.  And if you do something with Fred.  You guys can pick up 20 for that. 
[01:09:30]  Right.  But the girls get 50.  No, no, no, I'm jealous.  I would love to put your party.  All right.  Well, you're going to be at our party when we're at the St. Adam's Brewery.  All right.  Don't worry.  I thought I...  All right, Fred.  I think we're going to let you go.  Yeah.  I'm not sending you money, but you can party with us when we're up in Boston.  Freddy, it's not a big time.  Yeah, don't go accidentally wheeling yourself into some guy's mule.  Well, I'll wait for that. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  Oh, oh.  I got a mule in my mouth.  But this way, if you had no to give me some gas to get there.  I'm not getting there.  I'm just bad with direction.  If you just give me some cash to get there.  Oh, now we got to give him cash to get to the brewery?  All right.  Start rolling now.  You'll be there by the time we get there. 
[01:10:30]  That was another class move that Dave Dickless used to do with Wheelchair Fred after we left.  They used Wheelchair Fred at our old station.  Yeah.  And they would pretty much exploit him like we do.  Oh, that's how bad this guy is.  At least we would get the guy rides home and throw him in a cab and stuff.  He would go to station events and beg for money because he didn't have any money to get home.  And I swear to you, and this was reported in all the papers up there, the local papers, 
[01:11:00]  Wheelchair Fred had a wheelchair himself home one night on the side of a highway.  He was going down like Route 9.  There you go.  That's how Dave Dickless takes care of his people.  Yeah.  Another fine example.  Not to mention, he actually eventually wound up giving Weird Wheelchair Fred his own show.  I would listen to that, though.  I would listen to that.  Sure.  But I, yeah, mid-days, and then they doubled you.  I used to go, though. 
[01:11:30]  Hey, Fred, just sing this one verse.  What a beautiful world.  How a beautiful world.  Can you sing, hello, Dolly?  Hello, Dolly.  I said hello.  Dolly, it's so good to see you here today.  Nice to see you here today.  And sleep.  And sleep.  When you woke up, you won't remember any of it.  And wheelchair Fred's sleep.  All right, Fred.  I sound just like Ozzy. 
[01:12:00]  What?  I sound like Ozzy.  You sound like Ozzy.  You make Ozzy look good.  Not for nothing.  I make Ozzy look good, you're right.  All right, Fred, give your plug.  Where are you going to be appearing tonight?  At the local Applebee's again?  He's going down to the motherland.  It's sleep night.  No, this guy appears.  You're going to be at the chicken bone?  No, I'm going nowhere tonight.  You're not going anywhere?  Why?  Because I don't have to go.  What? 
[01:12:30]  I don't want to go.  Why don't you go to the chicken bone?  How about you just go to the...  So he's a little leery about going out of the house by himself.  I'm going to keep you out of the house by myself.  What?  Oh, I heard that one.  I heard that one.  Oh, is that what he's going to do?  That's too much information, Fred.  I don't know if he made the radio, but Fred has a big thing that ladies usually have, and 
[01:13:00]  he'll take care of himself, he said.  What does he have?  Oh, does he?  He has like a...  You know what's so funny?  I was in the bar the other night, and a girl stood up at the end of the bar.  She's an angry lesbian.  And screamed, I can do anything a man can do.  Yeah, well, tell the buyer a round of the drinks then, honey.  And a pair of...  I got Freddy!  I got Freddy!  Hey, Fred. 
[01:13:30]  Does this device have a name?  It's Big Rubber Thing.  Is it the triple ripple vibrating...  Wait, wait, hold on.  What did he say?  He said...  It's Big Rubber Thing.  Wait a minute, Fred.  Hold on a minute.  I don't see it!  Fred, is it...  This thing is just rubber?  Does it have any electronics in it?  No, it's just rubber.  And you...  So, you take it, and you put it somewhere, right?  Without...  Let's all be very vague here.  But you take it, and you... 
[01:14:00]  What?  Wait, wait.  Wait, what?  When the doo-doo...  All right.  How old is he?  Four?  That didn't make the radio.  All right.  No, that's just...  All right, well, Eddie, that's very funny, but that didn't make the radio.  We know where he puts it, so don't say it.  Put it, man.  But you do that, and as you sit in the chair, or have you just installed it on the wheelchair? 
[01:14:30]  Keeps him from falling off when he stops...  Why are you bit...  Oh, that's the bathtub.  So you...  He never falls out of the seat.  He said...  He said in his bed and in his bathtub, I think.  Oh, in the bathtub.  And you enjoy doing that to yourself, Fred?  Yeah, I must admit, I guess I just said, why are you guys...  I must confess. 
[01:15:00]  You like that, yeah?  Yeah, I must admit, I guess you are a guy called gay.  But you're not gay.  I don't want to leave the bush.  He doesn't want to leave the bush.  Right.  He doesn't want to leave the bush.  I don't love the bush.  Yeah, but is this...  Well, George W. likes you, too.  Is this a device in the shape of a man's unit, though?  Yeah.  You're gay. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, God.  You're a faggot friend.  So it's a floppy rubber man's mule.  Does it have yam bags attached to it?  Yeah.  You're so gay, bro.  I can pretty much...  I'll accept, because we had this discussion with couples, and guys will argue that it's,  you know, they don't mind this act.  If a girl stimulates certain areas...  With something that doesn't look like a man's unit.  But he's taking this big, rubbery, floppy mess. 
[01:16:00]  I mean, you know, I bet you for what it costs for that rubbery, floppy unit, you could probably  pick up one of those pocket pals...  Right, right here on the other side.  That's right.  They have those rubber dogs.  I got it for free.  A gay friend got it for me.  A gay friend got it?  Oh, God.  Gave it to you for free.  Did you wash it, Fred?  He's...  Why am I losing weight?  This guy's like John Merrick if he was gay. 
[01:16:30]  I am not an animal!  Well, sometimes I am.  I am not on a diet.  Why am I losing weight?  I am an animal!  I'm getting skimier.  My doctor says something about teeth.  I am an animal!  Oh, man.  So you got it from a gay friend, and you use it...  How often do you use this?  How often a week do you use it? 
[01:17:00]  And why did the gay friend give it up?  He was done with this thing?  This guy goes through those apparatuses like athletes go through sneakers.  You know what I'm saying?  He's going to re-up every three months.  He wears the form off the head.  It becomes just very smooth.  It's like a rubber stick with no...  There's no helmet on it.  When it looks like the Washington Monument, it's time for the middle of it.  I think it's fresh out of the box.  Wow.  What, Fred?  It's fresh out of the box. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, fresh out of the box.  Fresh out of the box.  Well...  Pencil in a joke there.  You want to be...  Yeah.  Okay.  Fred?  How often...  I'm just scared of AIDS.  Fred, shut up.  You're scared of AIDS.  Well, sure.  You have 18-year-old guys to bang you if you're scared of AIDS.  Fred!  How often do you use this thing?  I'm talking like I'm talking to a dead guy.  Fred's out there shacking up with guys who suck C for drug money.  He's just...  Come on here and... 
[01:18:00]  You know, he's afraid of AIDS.  I'll be...  I use it about once a week.  Once a week?  You use it about once a week?  One night.  Like Tuesday nights is the night.  He got it from a gay guy who only uses it on Sunday afternoons after church.  Hey, when you're done with it, do you clean it off or just hang it over the door to keep burglars away?  I clean it off with this point.  Oh, God.  That's awful. 
[01:18:30]  I want to get some real action in this town.  You can't get any real action?  I can't find it.  Yeah.  All right, Fred.  Yeah.  I think we've learned too much today.  Big rubber mule that he's going to use tonight.  Once a week he uses it.  So not tonight.  Maybe tomorrow.  Oh, why not tonight?  Because I have principles, don't you know?  What? 
[01:19:00]  I have principles.  He has principles?  Yeah, he only uses it on the Sabbath.  Right.  Yeah.  He doesn't want to be considered a slut.  Fred, how drunk do you have to be before you use that thing?  Yeah, really.  I hardly drink anymore.  What?  He hardly drinks anymore.  Oh, really?  We're thinking...  I'm back on medication.  Yeah?  Suppositories?  They fall out like M&Ms out of a bag.  No, A-Z-T. 
[01:19:30]  I'm on the AIDS medicine.  It's a control of my temper.  Control your temper?  Yeah.  How are you doing Ritalin?  You're angry?  You're on that...  I was a good...  I ripped the radio out of the van.  I couldn't hear that either.  Yeah, I...  I don't know.  I ripped the radio out of the van.  You ripped the radio out of the van?  Oh.  You just stick it in your balloon nut? 
[01:20:00]  Why did you do that?  What were you mad at?  It was like 95 degrees out.  Yeah.  It was 95 degrees out, so you decided you had to rip the radio out of the van?  I just gave him smoke and get the gentleman dropping off one block from the house.  So you ripped the radio out of his van?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, Fred.  He's an angry, angry Fred.  A-N-G guy.  I bet you could open this guy's colon. 
[01:20:30]  It would look like the contents of a shark's stomach, a spare tire, an old license plate.  License plate.  A tender boy?  A couple of class rings just falling out of there, like, you know, a human leg.  You know, just, oh, what's this guy been up to?  Jeez.  One thing you want to realize is I'm very strong upper body-wise.  You're very what body-wise?  I'm strong upper body.  Yeah, he is.  Oh, strong upper body.  This guy's an animal from, like, his nips up, so he could work a mule like nobody's business. 
[01:21:00]  He's got to reach around, though, with the...  When you have the apparatus, you have to reach around and probably...  Yeah, Fred, how do you work that?  Do you use one hand for the rubber mule and then the other hand you're taking care of yourself?  No, I use one hand for the rubber mule and one hand to step behind myself.  And your legs just lay there in the way?  No, I've got to pull you to my legs.  He just, uh... 
[01:21:30]  He has a pulley system set up in the bedroom.  He pulls his leg down.  He spreads out the cheek with one hand and dips the end of that thing in a vat, a 55-gallon vat of KY jelly.  And, uh, he's actually ruined the tightness on his raisin.  He has to have, uh, like a piece of elastic sewed back in there because he stretched it out.  And every time he gets rid of a sewer pickle, his, uh, his butt slam shut because he's lost the elasticity in it. 
[01:22:00]  All right.  Is that what you're trying to say?  I would say 50% of them probably made it through.  Fred, did you have to have an O-ring put on your balloon rod?  No.  He blew a seal.  Yeah.  That's what brought the challenger down.  It was a leaky O-ring.  A leaky O-ring.  So if he could do that to a spacecraft.  Yeah.  Imagine what he could do to this.  He blew a seal.  No, I'm not kidding you.  All right.  Fred, we've got to let you go, right? 
[01:22:30]  All right.  How'd you go?  Fred, we've got to cut you loose.  It's too...  It's a Steve on line four.  Who's the lifeguard when a friend takes?  What's this?  I need action.  You need action.  You need action.  He sounds like Al Pacino.  Just make your heart.  They pull you back.  I don't think you like it.  Hey, uh...  Rock!  I want to make you a hell of a wonder.  And corrupt like the rock. 
[01:23:00]  It's a Burgess murder, ladies and gentlemen.  It's a Burgess murder.  Turn on the bread.  Oh.  Look at that.  You're a mongrel, kid.  You're a mongrel.  What do you got there?  Was that a Rove?  Yeah, I get the bread a roll for three grand.  And then they get the appetizer.  What do you get out of it?  I get the 500.  Shrewd, kid.  Real shrewd.  Rock, spread me out.  Right.  So I can take this rubber thing.  Put that boxing glove on and punch me right in my ring. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, yeah, kid.  I'm going to make it...  I'm going to make it...  Crease me up and chase me around the ring like a chicken rock.  I'm going to make a good rock.  Oh, we got to get rid of it, man.  Hey, Fred.  I can tell you this.  Hey, Fred.  We got a homework assignment for you.  Next time you call in, we want you to sing It's a Beautiful World or whatever that song is.  Wonderful World.  Which Wonderful World?  It's a Wonderful World by Louis Armstrong, okay?

That's for a basic one-activity party.  A hundred.  Wow, that's pretty cheap.  That's where the prices start.  And then from there, the sky's the limit, because all the ladies are independent contractors.  Uh, you don't think the girls would mind being with a guy with a... 
[01:25:30]  That's no problem, hon.  Handicap's no problem.  Oh, good.  Good.  So I could come down and, uh, you know, get a girl and climb aboard and start going...  Well, you have to come in and discuss that with the lady.  Oh, okay.  So for a hundred bucks, could I put my head between her...  Could I do that? 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, I'm not allowed to discuss that on the phone.  You have to discuss that with the lady, okay?  Oh, I just want to warn you that when I get in the room and things get hot and heavy, I could get a little wild.  You know, when I get...  Oh, is that okay?  That's no problem, hon.  Oh, do you take...  A mastercard?  Yes, we do.  Uh, could I bring a muzzle so I don't clamp down on anything I shouldn't? 
[01:26:30]  That's fine.  Do you think a girl would mind if...  When I start...  She spanks me.  You have to come in and discuss with the lady.  Are they pretty women?  Very pretty.  This might sound...  It's your time, okay?  This might sound like a strange request, but...  Do you have any...  Girls that aren't that attractive, babe?  All of our ladies are very nice.  I have...  Jungle fever. 
[01:27:00]  You have any...  Girls?  We have black ladies.  We have Asian ladies.  We have Oriental ladies.  It just depends.  I have to go now because I'm very busy, okay?  Do you have any...  Do you have a dwarf?  Um, no, we don't.  Not at this time.  Because I saw a dwarf in a movie once and it made me...  Goodbye, okay?  No, no, no, no, no.

[02:05:30]  a k-dog wannabe no it's not that he happens to have the same name i was just i just picked that name  out of the blue because i had another name which i didn't particularly like so i macho man was  already taken no the name the name i had before k-dog was was dr k doctor k yeah that's that's the doctor  is in yeah baby k-dog he's got your prescription k-dog jesse james oh you didn't know all right hold on 
[02:06:00]  john has a comment uh john what's up hey guys what's up listen i just want to tell you  that tape would sound better if you played it backwards  demonic messages thank you john all right let's get back to the tape because this is another uh  current events break all right why are you turning so red over there spaz you all right  yeah all right my head hurts all right here we go drop a dime let me know what's on your mind 
[02:06:30]  new rochelle new york time and um i'm looking to hear at the article that the million man youth  march and it's been a move now if you're looking at the article can you see it just says the million  youth march there was the million man march which was down in dc yeah and then there's the million  youth march which is up in harlem yeah see if you're a man you can't be a youth right or a ute so i said  as you say okay million man youth woman march if you name me all right it happens all right it 
[02:07:00]  happens time and time again man youth march and there's been a million prayers being said for peace  as uh muhammad khalid will be marching you could say muhammad uh comma khalid  or his name khalid muhammad oh see if you you kind of got his name backwards there dog k  my apologies to mr muhammad 
[02:07:30]  all right so you're really not sure what his name is right  i did read the article before i did this well didn't you see his name yeah i thought i read it  as muhammad what do you have a listexia there might have been a comma there i just didn't see it all  right let's go i don't think so in the newspaper all right let's move on this is his commentary about  the million man youth march written as uh muhammad khalid will be marching actually he's marching  right about now and uh last year was only about 6 000 marchers this year it's gonna be well according 
[02:08:00]  to him slightly more he was uh went through two courts actually to get this okayed as the city tried to  shut the rally down because of khalid's um racist remarks in my opinion i think that it shouldn't  happen but my opinion doesn't apparently count from just one of the masses here in the city of new  york masses so why don't you think uh the million man youth march shouldn't take place yeah because 
[02:08:30]  the guy is a racist joke why we should people follow his message you mean racist like did he  say anything like they'd be rioting up and no it's just no it's just all right yeah that and i  have to agree with him the grease man likes the k-dog yay the color's a problem a problem snarlings  right k-dog yeah it's the grease man with the k-dog yeah what a doodle yaddle deedle what a doodle 
[02:09:00]  deedle though i'm not yeah we hate the colors don't we k-dog yeah it's k-k-k-dog yeah what a doodle  what a doodle yeah me and the k-k-k-dog we don't like the jews either eh and the chinks eh what a doodle 
[02:09:30]  i'm not racist so you don't agree with neither am i yeah so you don't agree with muhammad khalid's uh  message of of of of hate or hate and violence i don't believe in violence okay all right all right  that's good okay here we go anyway but yet much will be happening  and you got more of some feedback over there 
[02:10:00]  oh yeah punch it up holy christ it is oh it is priceless man um eric what's up oh hey how's it  going guys all right hey listen um did w anyw hire spaz strictly for entertainment purposes or or  did they actually think that he could intern for this for this radio station the only great justice 
[02:10:30]  that could be he is absolutely horrible i'm embarrassed to be a communications major listening  to this guys i can't believe how bad this guy is oh all right thank you thank you very much you guys  suck all right bye rob from brooklyn checking in opie in other news the giant mosquito ate mohammad  khalid while k-dog made a mess on hillary's munched carpet  all right anyway let's get back to the tape chris chris uh real quick 
[02:11:00]  saying a spaz really shines when he reads from the newspaper  and i guess he breaks up his stories by using the term anyway here we go anyway  but yeah the march will be happening it is happening right about now when or how it's going  and the police did promise to um well be in less amount of force this year basically what it is  is that they're going to have 1500 less officers there to close down the rally this year there's 
[02:11:30]  going to be no riot gear no helicopters swooping in to tear up the place and um  um well the cops tore up the place last year is that what they did you might as well just tell  the people that the the cops are going to keep their fire hoses uh at home  i just i was looking for a phrase to say and that's the first thing that came to mind all right  let's move on yeah that's basically it so i hope the courts are happy and it'll be their fault if 
[02:12:00]  something happens yeah that's what i say yeah it's bound to be bad if there's black people there  yeah the doodle the grease man here with the kkk dog yeah  so it's the courts fall wow are you an american are you from this country no i can't believe you're  more offensive than the grease man do you understand they do have the right to to have this march 
[02:12:30]  yes but it is american we don't most people don't agree that he had the march but but it's up to the  courts to to defend that right well it's called freedom of speech you idiot i know but giuliani  fought it i'm all i'm saying is that if they promote hate and violence and that's what happened last  year why i want to promote hate and violence i don't want anyone else promoting it no why would the  court allows history to repeat itself yeah they do i agree yeah i agree yeah if it's brown keep them 
[02:13:00]  down yeah that's what the grease man says and the kkk dog game all right are we almost done with your  commentary yeah yeah million man youth march fast that's the end of the canal of the mosquito  on the giant mosquito hold your hats people that's just my opinion if anybody wants to call me up at  six three three two three six nine to refute his opinion i'll be happy to put you on the air  right now i'm gonna kick your right ass brother i'm gonna kick your right ass i didn't mean it for all

[02:33:30]  some of the mets are stuck at four and a half games behind as they play the rockies tonight  actually our ladder going against uh bohannon  and the yankees lost dropped one to the angels eight to two  as uh andy pettit having a really tough season this year  captivating delivery so i'd really give a you know a rat's patoot  he doesn't like the yankees he's telling everyone he's telling everyone he doesn't like the  yankees anthony i despise them well that's his strategy he figures he doesn't like the yankees 
[02:34:00]  so he's not going to let anybody hear about how the yankees did so we'll lull them off to sleep  with his delivery but anyway i hate the yankees so i don't really give a you know a rat's patoot  patoot uh it gets you know for the yankees but my picks are still the mets to win the eastern division  for the central i would have to say houston and for the west i'm going with arizona for the american  league i want boston it's not going to happen but i'll pull for them anyway boston for the american 
[02:34:30]  league east for even the central and i'm pulling for oakland for the west and for the wild cards  i say national league cincinnati you'll get it and i'm thinking that the american league  league i'm gonna have to say texas so i'm going right these top yankees and braves are not going  to make the pennant race call it an outside limb i know people call it an outside limb i i accidentally  used two phrases at the in the same juncture what were you trying to say you're basically saying that 
[02:35:00]  the yanks and braves are not gonna be in the playoffs right i was going out on the limb do you realize  going out on a limb and there's an outside chance or that's what i was trying to say i thought you were  going on a whim or you could go on a whim uh out on a whim i used two phrases at the same time i  don't know all right so the yanks and braves are not going to make the playoffs they realize there's  only like three weeks left in the season and they're pretty much going to make the playoff miracles do  happen yeah we'll be one i don't like the braves unfortunately one didn't happen right here 
[02:35:30]  i know people knocking on the door pounding on the door saying what is up with uk dog my friends  they've hit me over the head with papers and and other crap just because of the comments i made  about the baseball situation but that's what i'm saying there's nothing to do with baseball will not  make it to the pennant race you know the time is up i think i think it's time for the mets and the  indians to move on in the world series jesus anyway so that's the case with baseball but as it stands

[02:39:30]  Here's my final song as I head out.  No pun intended.  Here's Guns N' Roses with Night Train.  Wait, wait, why would head out be a pun?  A pun with the song.  You know, I'm heading out on the night train.  There he goes.  Heading out.  There goes K-Dawg.  Back to the kettle. 
[02:40:00]  On the night train.  Heading back to the kettle.  Well, that was...  Mike, what's up?  Mike.  Somebody tell Spaz it's butthole surfers, not butthole servers.  Surfers?  I mean, an ounce of pronunciation.  You have an ounce of talent.  One ounce of talent.  Well, maybe...  The answer in the phone. 
[02:40:30]  Maybe Spaz is a butthole server.  You may not.  You see, one guy likes your catchphrase.  Just drop a dime and Spaz will enter from behind.  Frank, what's up?  Dude, how long was the umbilical cord wrapped around his throat?  For God's sakes.  I'm lucky he made it, I guess.  Hey, and the Yanks and the Braves aren't going to make it to the pennant race.  What are they in right now?  Come on.  They ain't going to make it.  They're not going to make it into the playoffs. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  No, he said they're not going to make the pennant race.  Oh, okay.  I screwed up, all right?  I'm at the playoffs.  Look at...  Oh, he's just...  He's just exhausted.  Uh, Jeff, what's up?  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Yo, could you please neuter the K-Dawg so he can't breathe?  I mean, Jesus Christ.  This is worse.  My IQ is through the f***ing floor.  I'm sitting here drooling over myself.  I'm wearing my f***ing hockey helmet.  Oh, look, dude, you can't say the F word. 
[02:41:30]  You can't curse.  We had to dump out of you twice, but we get your point.  Thank you, Jeff.  Thanks, guys.  All right, bye.  See you.  Uh, Mike, what's up?  Where did he go to college, in this case?  Uh, Iona.  Iona.  Are they going to take his diploma away?  They tried.  I mean, are they listening?  If anybody's listening to this show, he's retarded.  I just don't get it.  You guys are the best.  All right, Dick.  Thank you.  Bye.  Some guy wrote a whole news story about how the giant mosquito infiltrated the Million Man Youth March 
[02:42:00]  while Mohammed Khalid was performing the Rusty Trombone on Reverend Al.  Swear to God.  Wow.  This is more disturbing than Robert De Niro's Rupert Pupkin character having a fake talk show  in The King of Comedy.  Oh, that movie's great.  Andy, what's up?  You guys, you might as well quit after today because you're never doing anything funnier than this. 
[02:42:30]  You have to thank Spaz for your best bit ever.  This could be the funniest stuff I've ever heard.  Ever.  Thank you, Andy.  Ladies and gentlemen, you suck.  Kevin from the Bronx, that sports report by Spaz was the most back-ass effing stupid attempt  at sounding smart.  The Rangers have practically clinched for the playoffs, and there's no effing way the Yanks  or the Braves will not make the playoffs.  Shoot him.  Shoot him now.  That's why I said I was hoping for Boston. 
[02:43:00]  It's not going to happen, but I'll pull for him anyway.  What, is the Yankees going to get in a plane crash?  Are you hoping for a plane crash at this point?  It could happen.  Al, what's up?  Hey, maybe the mosquito is going to eat the Yankees.  They won't make it to the playoffs.  You'll probably get one of those electronic shot collars for the K-Dog here so you guys can zap his ass.  Yeah, we'll put up one of those fences where you put the wire in the ground so the dog just stops right at your property. 
[02:43:30]  Invisible fence.  Invisible fence.  Scott, what's up?  Yeah, hi.  I'd like to offer Spaz a job in my area of expertise.  Yeah.  I'd like him to come out of my clock every hour and go,  Cuckoo, cuckoo, he's an idiot.  What's the matter with him?  Well, as I read here, Opie, 
[02:44:00]  breaking news off the AP,  the New York Air National Guard announced that two of its F-16s have just downed what they believe to be a giant mosquito.  They say they used a DDT-laden Queens resonance strapped to a Sparrow missile.  Spaz, stick to Morse code.  That's James from Queens.  Wow.  Well, Spaz, there you have it. 
[02:44:30]  Your demo tape.  That was the fastest hour and a half ever.  Ever.  Great job.  Next time, now that wasn't the polished version.  No, that was my very rough draft.  Maybe next time we'll get a polished version where you throw in some bumpers and stuff.  Can we bring you back in a couple weeks to see how you progressed?  Yeah.  Okay.  You know?  That'd be great.  I have to lay down.  My head hurts.  We've got to find some Tylenol.  I've got to lay down.  All right.  Wow.  Mark, what's up?  Hey, I want to know how to pass it off the Jerry Lewis telethon to do that sports report. 
[02:45:00]  He sucks.  Thank you, Mark.  You guys are great, man.  All right, bye.  See you.  Bye.  It's a nice report.  The giant mosquito.  That has been plaguing queens.  Obviously, this first reported by a crack news reporter, K-Dog, on the radio station,  once in five seconds, he makes you moment. 
[02:45:30]  As he so eloquently put it, even I, Tom Brokaw, can't speak very well, but I can say encephalitis.  Hello, America.  Opie and Anthony want you to vote for boobs.  Wait.  Wait a minute.

Oh, this is wonderful! 
[02:48:00]  Have you ever been on the space shuttle?  No, I haven't.  Have you?  Oh, it's beautiful!  Yes!  Fantastic!  It's going to have a big disco ball.  Mm-hmm.  They're going to decorate it all.  Hey, do you know how to dial a phone?  Yes.  What's your favorite sexual position?  Hello!  Donna wants to know.  Hello!  Is she hanging up finally?  She's gone.
