<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a comedic skit about a deadly "O&A virus," immediately transitioning into vulgar banter, including repeated use of the phrase "liar whore."  The hosts then extensively covered the severe Buffalo, New York snowstorm, featuring numerous caller accounts of power outages and travel disruptions. This contrasted with discussions about the relatively mild hurricane season, highlighting seemingly contradictory weather reporting. A caller's poker game dispute, involving a hand with four fives and an ace kicker, prompted a discussion of poker rules and the recently passed legislation restricting online gambling, leading to commentary on government hypocrisy.  The hosts also addressed Jimmy Norton's absence due to oversleeping, detailing the dispatch of "Club Soda Kenny" to rouse him. Norton eventually joined the show, explaining his tardiness.  A "Fatty Pig Fatty Contest" was mentioned, along with various other unrelated tangents.

Bob Saget then joined the show in studio.  The conversation began with a vaguely described humorous anecdote involving "midnight express action" and a "party favor feat."  Much of the discussion focused on Saget's new game show, *One vs. 100*, with graphic descriptions of its format, contestants (described as "waterheads"), and Saget's own on-set behavior, including his preference for fist-bumping (coining the term "fisting season") and a claim of having "mounted" Howie Mandel on *Deal or No Deal*. He also promoted his show *Mouthful of Shame*, highlighting a scene where he puts his fist in a man's mouth. Saget further discussed his personal life, including his new girlfriend (whose age was vaguely alluded to), his upcoming *Today Show* appearance, and past experiences with Howie Mandel, including a humorous anecdote involving Colin Quinn. He also mentioned a Cleveland show video featuring him exposing his genitals. A caller shared a story about a sixth-grade student who considered Saget an inspiration, prompting discussion about his public image juxtaposed with his *Full House* persona.  The conversation veered into Friday the 13th superstitions, plane crash jokes, and a news report about a woman in a ski mask mistaken for a Freddy Krueger mask.

A call from Chazz Palminteri followed, discussing their past collaboration on an unsold sitcom and his work on *A Bronx Tale*.  The interview covered Palminteri's career, one-man show,  his experiences working with Robert De Niro, Sean Penn, and Christopher Walken,  a memorable encounter with Frank Sinatra, and his new film, *A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints*. This segment also included unrelated discussions of the "Fatty Pig Fatty Contest," listener calls, a review of a *Nip Tuck* scene, Opieâ€™s football picks, and audio clips of Mel Gibson's post-arrest apology. The show then transitioned into an outdoor segment featuring a contortionist, Aurora, performing in the studio, followed by impromptu street interviews and sexually suggestive comments towards passersby.

The show returned to the studio with further discussion of Mel Gibson's anti-Semitic remarks, including audio clips and caller opinions.  A lengthy call with Bob Kelly, stranded in Buffalo due to the snowstorm, followed, filled with rambling, comedic discussion, crude humor, and personal insults.  The conversation shifted to a news story about a woman found dead in a ditch, sparking further off-color commentary and jokes about body disposal. A listener then called in with a story about discovering a frozen body while hunting, leading to more morbid humor.

The following segment began with a renewed discussion of the woman found dead in a ditch, transitioning into listener calls.  Pete from Staten Island discussed a local news appearance with his wife, prompting commentary on her attractiveness.  Another caller, Chris, referenced a previous segment.  A humorous exchange between Opie and Anthony followed, involving a claim that Anthony's ass had an email conversation, leading to jokes about flatulence.  Michelle from Seattle ("Smurffucker") called in with a story about a neighbor dying in his driveway, again resulting in morbid jokes about body disposal. Several more callers shared stories about discovering dead bodies.  The segment then shifted to an internal conflict concerning a producer, "Iraq," accused of using a "ghost program" to steal pictures from another producer's camera, revealing staff distrust and details about their video game activities.  The segment concluded with a "Line of the Day" segment and more banter.

A final segment featured a female guest who was teased by the hosts about her physique, prompting discomfort. This was followed by discussion of upcoming guests Patrice O'Neill and Vinny Brand, jokes about the Buffalo snowstorm, and a listener email about listening to the show while bathing.  The show concluded by announcing "Tourette's Day," a segment mocking individuals with Tourette's Syndrome, with a hearing-impaired reporter slated to comment, ending with sound effects mimicking tics.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony and James Norton.  Right from the beginning you knew this was different.  The infection was everywhere.  It was in the street outside.  It was coming through your windows.  It was a virus.  Terrible viral infection gives people this incurable disease.  It kills their veins and blood with pure rage.  By the time they tried to evacuate the cities, it was already too late.  Jesus Christ, five hours?  If it infects, replicates and kills this fast, these numbers can't be right.  The numbers are correct. 
[00:00:30]  I wish to God they weren't.  It's that one.  There is no God.  It's like some kind of horror movie.  It's such a great virus that you want to infect others like your friends and co-workers.  Sometimes it leaves pustules.  There's nothing you can do about it.  God almighty.  You could have stopped this outbreak before it mutated.  They're highly contagious.  What's this rash from?  We're facing a new strain.  It can cause life-threatening bleeding or even asphyxiation.  Where is it spreading?  All over the place. 
[00:01:00]  All right.  We're coming out.  Here we go.  I'm a boredom.  Anthony.  I'm a little dirty.  Wipe me.  James Norton.  Boom.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I know a thing or two about a thing or two. 
[00:01:30]  Fancy talk.  Fancy talk for a whore.  Liar whore.  Liar whore.  And you'll know it.  Shut your goddamn pie hole. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, we got that?  All right.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  No poop.  All right.  What have you got cooking in your oven over here?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ah, yeah.  Can I hear another one of those?  All right.  What have you got cooking in your oven over here?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[00:02:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  What a creep.  Listen to that laugh.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  She does colonics for a living, that fine voice.  Yes.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  Hi.  Let's see what cities we have to say hi to this morning.  Well, we got to say hi to New York.  Of course.  Every morning we got to say hi to New York. 
[00:03:00]  Come on.  It's right out the window.  Why not?  Let's go, Mets go.  Why not?  Another great game for the Mets last night, although I did not see it.  I made it to, I think, the fifth inning.  And then you went sleepy by.  And then I caught the knife when I woke up to come into work today.  I mean, when is Major League Baseball going to figure this crap out?  They've been bitching about this, the fans and sports radio, for many, many years.  These games just go on forever, and they start way too late. 
[00:03:30]  It's the nature of the beast.  It doesn't have an end until it's over.  You just don't know.  But people have jobs to go to.  Are they trying to get the West Coast audience, and that's why they do like an 8.15 start time on the East Coast?  Yeah.  Is that what it's all about, I guess?  Exactly.  So why don't you just move the game to 7?  The first hour is like whatever baseball anyway.  Some fans want to watch the entire game.  Oh, my.  Yeah, but then we suffer.  What time did the game end last night? 
[00:04:00]  Midnight?  That's 1-2-0 if you had a bell on the game.  There are times where you're watching a game, and your team's losing, and they start rallying in the 9th, and you're like, oh, please don't tie it up.  I don't care if you lose.  Just don't tie this game up.  I got a big meeting in the morning.  I can't deal with the extra innings.  I love my team, but I've got to go to sleep.  No extra innings.  Please, just lose.  I don't care.  Yeah, you start making deals with yourself. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  Hey, you know what?  It was about a four-hour game last night.  This is all you need to know today.  Ready?  This is what we do.  Two balls, two strikes, one on, two out.  No score.  That is a bomb to right.  Mets up.  Two zip.  There you go.  There you go.  That's all you needed.  See, we save you the trouble here on the Opie and Anthony show.  And then finally. 
[00:05:00]  2-1 pitch.  A little floater.  Valentin out.  And the Mets win game one.  There you go.  There you go.  Condensed it down to about 40 seconds.  There you go.  That's all you need.  That's really all you need.  That's baseball.  That's pretty much the front page of the New York papers today.  Everything else was a swing and a miss, a base hit, a double play.  All the, you know, he's out, he's out, he's out.  Maybe one or two interesting plays.  Yeah, you know.  A couple good strikeouts. 
[00:05:30]  A couple guys stranded on base.  You know.  Yeah.  From now on, that's what we do.  That's it.  We want our listeners to get a good night's sleep.  We're talking highlights only.  All right.  So we say hi to New York today.  We say hi to Detroit this morning.  Yeah.  Because they're talking about a little snow up there.  Yeah.  Oh, I just watched the weather last night and saw what Buffalo was going through.  Well, that's the last city we say hi to right away this morning.  Buffalo, depending where you live, a foot to two feet of snow today. 
[00:06:00]  That's great.  A foot to two feet of snow.  It's not even Halloween yet.  Because it's still August.  What month is it?  You know, I spent three years in Buffalo.  I spent three years in Rochester.  I spent five years in college in Geneseo.  Behind you.  There it is.  They're showing pictures of Buffalo.  There's where I used to live.  Some snow.  Would you just have a nervous...  Power outages.  Would you have a nervous breakdown if you were living up there, Anthony?  I'd be nude in a snow drift, crying. 
[00:06:30]  Just crying, hopefully, right?  That's how they'd find me.  I'd be, what's your problem?  I think of the cold.  And I'd be brought in for exposure.  When I came back to New York, I would tell people about my time at Buffalo.  And I would tell people, it would snow before Halloween.  And then it would snow every day because the lake affects snow.  Yeah.  And no one believed me.  So now they could look on the TV for themselves and see what's going on up there.  Who needs it?  It is just way, way too early to think about snow, even for Buffalo.  Why do you guys live there? 
[00:07:00]  Huh?  Why do you guys live there?  It's beautiful up there, actually.  What are you doing?  You know what?  You get used to the snow, though.  They do.  People are just driving around like it's nothing.  Always have.  And always will.  Like when you see a little dusting in Dallas.  Hello, Dallas.  You know, the whole city goes into a panic and shuts down.  And it's less than an inch of snow.  Makes the news.  Because they don't know what to do with it.  Buffalo, it's like business as usual for the most part.  You'll see people just driving to the malls, driving.  They don't do snow days up there. 
[00:07:30]  No.  You make it in.  I'm sure there's a few closings today.  But in general, they don't close things down unless they really, really have to.  No.  They have figured out how to remove the snow many, many years ago.  But Buffalo, everyone's talking about you this morning.  Our local news, how to talk about the snow in Buffalo.  Buffalo, and you know what Drudge did, Drudge Report, when I went on there last night.  All it had was New York, lots of snow. 
[00:08:00]  So you read it and think New York City.  Right.  You don't think New York State, you know.  You get to New York.  So I click on it.  It's like, oh, Buffalo.  Okay.  Duh.  Well, that's part of New York.  Again, though, trying to get you, could have said Buffalo, a lot of snow.  It's kind of weird, and no offense to all my pals up in western New York.  It's kind of weird to think that Buffalo is part of New York.  It's more like it's part of Canada than New York City.  It's like part of Canada and the upper Midwest. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  When I was young and I didn't know any better, you know, I was really into the NBA, and Buffalo  had a team back then, and it was a New York team.  So I followed them, like, wow, cool, I want to follow the New York teams, you know, as  a kid.  And then I was asking my dad, let's go to a Braves.  They were, oh, my God, what, the Braves?  The Buffalo.  Huh?  Uh, no, they used to be basketball back in the day.  This is going way back.  Must have been a rough transition to baseball. 
[00:09:00]  Huh?  No, well, no, then.  Well, they've been trying to get a major league team there forever.  I think they've finally given up, unfortunately.  Oh, poor Buffalo.  Well, they're in between, like, you know, Toronto's right there.  You got Cleveland kind of in the area.  Yeah.  You know?  But anyway, I wanted to go to a game, and then I realized, you know, how far Buffalo was.  Yeah.  We're not going to a game anytime soon.  But this is the local news down here in New York City.  Talking about Buffalo and their snow today.  And then, of course, the news anchors have to have some cute banter about global warming. 
[00:09:30]  Don't they always?  In Buffalo this morning, and people are waking up to a fresh coating of snow.  Up to two feet of snow fell overnight in some areas.  The heavy snowed down tree limbs and ripped power lines, leaving more than 150,000 customers without power.  Buffalo Niagara International Airport had to shut down for about two hours late yesterday.  You were talking about that coming yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  Cold air.  Man.  It's global warming.  Is that what it is again?  Oh, global warming. 
[00:10:00]  Everything is global warming.  We just blame everything else.  We're not blaming.  I'm just saying it's a phenomenon.  Like the mess won.  It's global warming.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  Global warming came out of the bullpen and blessed Billy Wagner.  Right.  And we won the game.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Action.  Uh.  Does anybody remember last night? 
[00:10:30]  I, uh.  Wow.  I have no idea what he's trying to say.  What were the, what was he trying to tie together there?  Global warming, the Mets, and snowing in Buffalo.  And a bullpen.  What?  Yeah.  I actually hope there's a driving warning in the Buffalo area today.  Everything is closed, but it is due.  Yeah, I know.  A lot of trees are down.  Screwing up everything.  It's more about power.  Outage.  Power.  In, uh, in Buffalo. 
[00:11:00]  So there you go.  Global warming.  Yes, of course.  And what happened to our hurricanes?  What happened to our hurricanes?  Well, I remember, uh, early in spring, they were talking about how this was going to be  the, uh, one of the worst hurricane seasons ever.  Going to be a lot of them.  A lot of them going to make landfall.  And now we're, uh, completely out of hurricane season.  And, um, I don't know what happened.  Did anything happen?  I think Cuba got hit with something.  But, uh, no.  Pretty much a mild hurricane season. 
[00:11:30]  That sucks too, man.  But they try to, like, rope you in.  I get roped, dude.  When you see that hurricane moving about a mile an hour for weeks on end.  For weeks, you watch.  Where's it going?  Which way?  Man, the anticipation that starts building within you is very exciting.  And then when you realize it's not going to hit one of the cities that you might have  family or friends in, then it's, all bets are off.  Now you're hoping for some crazy stuff to happen.  You don't want it to hit.  Yeah, they rope you in with that. 
[00:12:00]  And every, no matter what season it is, they say, oh, they're looking for a real bad winter  this year.  It's going to be a lot of snow, more than average.  And then summer, ah, going to be hot.  Going to be hotter than ever.  Ever, ever.  And there's no accountability.  No.  They forget that they said that at the beginning of the season.  Same thing with the hurricanes and now the snow.  All right, let's go to Todd in Buffalo.  Todd, what's up?  Hey, man.  We're having a good time up here.  Yeah, how much snow around you? 
[00:12:30]  About a foot.  God.  No offense, Todd.  I don't miss that.  A foot of snow.  Yeah, it's pretty wild.  I mean, we got trees down on power lines.  And I'm plowing snow as we speak.  Why don't you head off to Kissing Bridge?  Oh, I decided to go local for everybody.  I hope he's going local.  I went local there, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  There isn't really any snow there at all.  It's all kind of more or less around the city and a little bit south of there.  A lot of power lines down, though, huh?  Oh, man. 
[00:13:00]  Like, you watch the sky lighting up blue.  There's transformers blowing all over.  Oh, sweet.  It's pretty wild.  All right, hang in there.  Oh, transformers blowing all over.  Okay.  I thought it was like our meatpacking district down there, which is kind of similar.  But do a lot of people drive SUVs up there?  I mean, four-wheel drives.  Yeah, chains.  I mean, it's like all you've got to drive.  Yeah.  You can't get a car.  It's spinning all over the place.  When I was up there, I mean, it was business as usual.  I'm telling you.  Everyone knows how to drive in the snow. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, good for them.  Matt.  Have fun.  Matt in Buffalo, what's up?  I'm Bruce.  Hey.  And I'm Matt.  Dude, to quote Private Pyle, I am in a world of ass joker.  This place sucks.  Matt doesn't know what he's talking about.  There's at least three feet of snow on the ground, trees down everywhere, crushing cars.  It's crap right now, man.  I want to kill somebody.  Why do you live there, Matt?  Family, man.  I'm going to college, you know.  Yeah.  I'm just wondering.  Well, you know.  It's like when you see the homeless guys shivering on the streets. 
[00:14:00]  Right.  You know, why the hell are you here?  Well, from July to September.  You mean homeless in Miami?  Well, from July to September 1st, when it warms up, it's just beautiful.  It really is.  It's snowing right now.  I just saw lightning and thunder.  Why is there lightning and thunder with snow?  That is the coolest thing to check out, though, man.  When you get a really good snowstorm and you get the lightning and the thunder, that is crazy.  Tornado.  Yeah.  All right, boys.  Have a good morning.  All right.  Hang in there.  Well, now we get to make fun of Buffalo. 
[00:14:30]  It's Lance in West Palm Beach.  Lance.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  What's snow?  Yeah, Lance doesn't even know what snow is.  West Palm.  Look at that.  Lance does not even know what snow is.  Lance.  Yep.  Hey, Lance.  How warm is it going to be in West Palm Beach today?  We're looking at 89 degrees, buddy.  Yeah?  That's right.  All right.  All clear.  All right.  Punch it out, guys.  All right.  Beautiful.  See?  Thank you.  Is that, um...  Is Freddy the guy from last night? 
[00:15:00]  Uh...  Might be.  I don't know.  Hey, uh, Freddy.  Hey, how you doing?  What's up?  What's your question?  Anthony, listen.  We were playing some Texas Hold'em yesterday, right?  And, um, three fives came out on the flop, right?  Yeah.  And then, um, on the turn, another five came out.  Yeah.  So, basically, there was four of a kind on the community, on the board.  Yeah.  So, everybody said, you know, there's four of a kind, so everybody went in all in.  So, everybody's being stupid and betting more and more and more, but obviously, I thought 
[00:15:30]  there was going to be a push, you know, everybody wins.  But the guy said there was four fives on the board and, uh, whatever, a jack.  And he had an ace kicker.  Yeah.  He says he wins because he has the ace kicker.  Four of a kind.  On the board.  On the board with an ace kicker.  He had the ace kicker.  There was a jack on the board.  So, what'd you have?  Yeah, he should have won.  Yeah, what'd you have?  I had whatever.  I had, uh, I forget, a ten. 
[00:16:00]  But it's a split pot because everybody has a four of a kind.  That's what I'm saying.  He's saying no because he has a kicker.  No.  It's the best five cards.  Oh, shoot.  It's like you're playing with five cards.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  See, if everybody, let's say, you know, let's say you're doing heads up to make this easy  and not have to go through so many people and there's four fives on the board and a king. 
[00:16:30]  Let's see, four fives and a king come out.  And you are holding, you know, a three and a four and the other guy's holding a five and a six.  Then you'd split it because it's total board.  I understand.  Yeah, there you go.  I just brought this up, Obie, because last night I was playing online because a law was  passed today, in case anybody doesn't know.  It starts today?  It was signed into legislation.  You've got to be kidding me.  And it's the Homeland Security, I guess the shipping inspections and security and whatever 
[00:17:00]  the hell that law is about.  But tied to it, which no one is talking about, is the online gambling law where they're going  to make it very difficult to get money to these places to gamble with and to get it back  once you win.  And that was signed in.  So I've been spending the last week or so trying to lose all the money I have in my account.  And I've been doing a damn good job. 
[00:17:30]  I believe I have 50 cents left in my account and they can have it.  But last night I was playing and there was this guy, Laugh Out Loud, his name was.  And he was being a real smart ass.  And he's throwing out some lines that I kind of thought were familiar, kind of in the same  vein as we say on this show, a lot of Jimmy Norton-esque kind of things.  Yeah.  So I was like, where are you from?  He's New York.  I said, okay, figures.  And it turns out he's a fan of the show, but didn't believe it was me. 
[00:18:00]  And as I'm trying to talk to him, he sucks out on the river and pulls an ace and blows  my pair away and wins.  So he goes, well, you're gone now.  Like he gets all smart assy on me.  So I just want to say to him, it was me because he didn't believe me.  And, and fooey on you.  Hey, what's going to happen?  I'm glad you took my money because I didn't need it. 
[00:18:30]  What's going to happen with the online gambling now?  I don't know.  Why are they taking that away?  That's just it.  I don't know.  Why?  Why?  Stop.  It's so much fun just to sit there, play a few hands of poker and make it interesting  because it's for actual money.  You know, that makes it interesting.  You play those stupid, like, play money games.  I can't stand it.  Boring.  You go in.  Everyone's all in on everything.  Oh, he's got a seven deuce offsuit.  All in.  Well, it wrecks the game. 
[00:19:00]  It ruins the game because there's no risk involved.  You're not risking anything.  So you'll go all in on anything.  Right.  So it stinks.  So when you add a little cash to the game, now it makes it interesting.  But the government has decided it's much too dangerous for people.  Thank God they're there to save us all the time.  Swoop in and save us.  But it's very obvious.  They just want their piece.  Of course they do.  They couldn't figure out how to get their piece.  Multi-billion dollar industry that they can't get a penny of. 
[00:19:30]  So they decided to be the party poopers.  I'm the party pooper.  If they could have figured out how to get a piece, trust me, we'd all be online gambling.  We'd be online gambling our asses off.  Exactly.  We would be online gambling right here during the radio show.  During the show, I'd have a screen up.  What the hell?  Of course.  Because they would make it a lot easier.  I just hate that.  The older I get, I'm just getting more cynical.  Just jaded and miserable.  All those fine words.  I could still online gamble, by the way. 
[00:20:00]  It's called E-Trade or Ameritrade or any of the other online brokerage firms that you can get on and gamble with.  Those aren't illegal.  You could take your money and open up an account and buy and trade stocks and use it just like a gambling site.  But I know I get a statement at the end of the year.  And whatever I make gets taxed. 
[00:20:30]  And that's what it's all about.  I don't get any statement from any of the online gambling sites.  Hey, you won this much.  Make sure you inform Uncle Sam so he can get his cut.  No.  So they cut it all off.  If it was so dangerous, if the reason that they're signing a bill against gambling is so important in saving the people from themselves,  why not outlaw online brokerage firms?  Right.  Or anything online that you have to open an account for and you can lose or make money on. 
[00:21:00]  Right.  Because you know how many people are playing the stock market and they have no clue what they're doing?  It's just like gambling.  No clue.  Not a clue.  No one uses due diligence and sits there and does their research.  They hear a friend go, dude, buy this penny stock, man.  Just buy it.  Hold it for 10 minutes and then dump it.  Dude, a friend of mine, he works for Bear Stearns.  He said.  Three letters.  D-E-X.  What's that? 
[00:21:30]  Go all in, dude.  I'm all in.  Uh-oh.  I bust it out.  How many people really that are in the stock market know what they're doing?  Online?  That's study it.  Not many.  No.  It's all.  That's study it and get all the pamphlets and go through it to see.  Get your prospectus.  Yeah.  To see what the managers are making.  No.  Figure out the math.  It's knee jerk.  They don't know.  It's knee jerk.  It's based on hearing something, having your ear to the ground. 
[00:22:00]  Your screens up.  You look through a few things.  You go, ah, this one's looked like it's done pretty good in the past couple of days.  Right.  Boom.  You put some money on it.  It goes up.  You cash out.  It goes down.  Oh, well.  It's gambling.  I bet you more people are losing their shirts.  Of course.  From trying to figure out the stock market on a daily basis on their own than this dumb  online gambling crap.  Yep.  They just want their peace.  They really care about us people. 
[00:22:30]  Why don't they close down the casinos?  Yeah, close down the casinos.  People are losing their livelihoods in these places.  That's a short drive.  I've seen the old fogies just taking all their nest egg money when they were supposed to get  old and retire.  And they're just pumping it into slot machines.  By the way, you know, I don't want people to confuse what I'm saying.  I'm all for online gambling.  Oh, bring it on.  Everything.  I don't care if there's a casino on every corner.  I don't care.  Bring it.  But what I do care about is that the government lies to us and says that, you know, it's all 
[00:23:00]  about protecting us, protecting the children.  No, it's not.  It's all about trying to figure out how they get their cut.  That's it.  Exactly.  We got to take our first break.  Someone wants me to work in the circus.  That bit has taken on a life of its own.  I got to figure out what the hell to do with that.  You're going to be aroused about?  Well, I've been doing radio since I was 18, and recently I said, you know, I'm wondering  what else I would do.  What else is out there?  If the radio show falls apart again. 
[00:23:30]  Because it will.  It's just a matter of time.  I always self-destruct.  And the next time it falls apart, it's pretty much the end of the Opie and Anthony show,  and I'm going to have to do something else.  I've only been a caddy and a radio show host.  I'm not going to slap this together again.  No.  Jesus.  Hell no.  Hell no.  There's a guy who's stuck...  A couple of years to get up to speed.  There's a guy who's been stuck in his truck since 2.30 in the morning.  Gordon and Buffalo.  He's going nowhere.  Stay there.  We'll talk to Gordon next.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:24:00]  Back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We're kicking it old school today, Opie.  It's just Anthony and I.  For the time being.  Well, no Jim Norton.  He wasn't supposed to take today off.  He's not a pilot, is he?  Jimmy doesn't fly his own plane, does he?  Hope not.  He's been taking a lot of Fridays off because he's doing the comedy thing around the country.  I know he's taking Monday off because he's going to Cuba.  Yeah.  I know he's taking next Friday off because he's going to San Francisco, I believe. 
[00:24:30]  Mm-hmm.  But no Jimmy today.  No phone call from Jimmy.  He's not answering his cell phone.  So Club Soda Kenny, secret agent man, is on his way to Jim Norton's apartment.  He's going and he's going to try to wake him up.  So we'll see what happens.  We'll get Kenny on the phone in a few minutes here.  What's that, a late night?  Every night's a late night for him.  He doesn't sleep.  Yeah, but by late night, I mean really.  It must have been probably three in the morning. 
[00:25:00]  We're off the air in Buffalo?  Yeah.  Huh?  Are we?  It's that bad up there?  The weather knocked us off the air in Buffalo, so...  We're doing that local Buffalo stuff and no one's hearing it?  Yeah.  Ah, screw Buffalo.  There's people trapped in the radio station.  They want to know if you want them to call into the show.  How do you get trapped in the radio station?  Just leave.  I slept at many radio stations over the years. 
[00:25:30]  Really?  So they're not hearing this stuff?  We did some fine local Buffalo stuff.  We're getting reports of people being trapped in radio stations.  People are saying...  Yeah, it is really bad up there, actually.  The more I read up on this thing.  Hey, Gordon.  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  What's going on?  Hey, I've been stuck here in my truck since 2.30 this morning waiting for a wrecker to come and get me unstuck.  Where are you?  I'm actually in Chitawaga.  I'm not...  I can walk home. 
[00:26:00]  I'm like probably about a mile from where I live, but I walked in my truck this morning  because I wanted to try to make dispatch at 7 o'clock this morning.  Wait.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You're a mile from your home.  You're a warm, comfortable home with a flat-screen TV and nice warm blankets and pillows  and probably a loving wife, maybe a kid, and you have decided to stay in your cold truck since 2.30 this morning?  Well, like I said, I wanted to try making it for dispatch this morning because I work up in Niagara Falls, 
[00:26:30]  and it just powers out, and walking my truck this morning, all you can hear are the trees just cracking and breaking.  Snap, crackle, pop.  Here, here, here.  All right.  All right, Gordon.  You know, somebody's got to deliver those new cars, you know what I mean?  Oh, is that what you got?  That's what you're hauling?  I understand.  Hey, listen, we've got to go to the radio station, The Edge, of course, in Buffalo. 
[00:27:00]  We've got Jim from The Edge calling in.  He's stuck at the radio station.  Gordon, hang in there, all right?  All right, buddy.  All right.  Jim, what's up?  Hey, guys, how are you?  Jim K, right?  Yes, yes.  The Jim K?  What's that?  The Jim K?  The Jim K.  So we're not on in Buffalo this morning?  You guys are not on in Buffalo this morning.  The snow here is absolutely, it's completely insane.  I couldn't believe it.  I had a comedy show last night.  I had to sleep at a club. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  And then try to make my way over here late last night, and then I got trapped here, and  I'm trapped here with, like, three other dudes.  And what do you have, no power?  There's no power, like, almost anywhere in the city.  We're running on generators.  All our stations are off the air except for 90,000 Rock.  Snorton Norton gets to continue broadcasting his drivel?  Oh, he came in.  Because, God forbid, they go a week without letting the lobster loose.  Ah, the lobster's going to be loose soon.  His car's stuck in the snow on the street, and we're listening to him, me and our production 
[00:28:00]  guys.  Yeah.  He's like, there's no way I wasn't coming in today.  It's my duty.  Like, oh, you son of a bitch.  I hate you.  He's trying to say it's his duty?  Yeah, yeah.  He said it's his duty.  This guy's the biggest ass.  He's one of the guys we're competing against in Buffalo.  Yeah, and unfortunately today, he's the only game in town.  Everything else is off the air.  Like, even the other radio stations around here, they're completely off.  You know, I got cell service, but I don't have landline service out of this building. 
[00:28:30]  I guess what happened, because Buffalo could handle the snow, but it started as a rainstorm,  right?  Like, freezing rain or whatever?  Yeah, they went through yesterday.  Yesterday was supposed to be, like, a little bit of, like, rain, and the temperature was  supposed to fluctuate between, like, the 40s and 50s.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden, you know, the apocalypse happened, I guess.  Yeah, yeah.  A little ice storm, and then, you know, brings down the power lines.  Well, the trees onto the power lines.  Well, now there's, like, in certain parts, there's three feet of snow down.  Like, just bonafide snow. 
[00:29:00]  Wow.  Yeah, and the highways are parking lots.  Yeah, Jim, we've been doing some great local stuff for Buffalo, finally, and we're not even  on in Buffalo today.  Damn it.  We're the worst.  I had the Rich Stadium one that you guys did, which was pretty awesome, and I run as a promo.  Oh, right on, man.  But hopefully Steve can send me the stuff that you guys are doing now so that we can play  that, too.  Oh, God.  All right, screw Buffalo today.  We're trying to pay attention to you today in your day of need, and we're not even on. 
[00:29:30]  We're not even on.  They hear it on satellite.  Yeah.  Actually, some people have found us online.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, you can stream us on your site or our site, right?  Yeah, yeah.  They're finding us because the feedback is going crazy, and they're saying they're listening  to the New York feed.  Because where are the important news that they want to hear out there in Buffalo?  Our listeners in Buffalo don't care about the latest local news. 
[00:30:00]  They're just home.  They just want to have fun.  What's going on?  He was demonstrating how to wear a ski mask on Channel 11.  Are you kidding me?  That's what they do.  Hey, Jim, how's the buzz up there?  It's quite well.  Uh-oh.  You hesitated, Jim.  I've been at this game a long time.  You went, it's quite well.  What did you say?  You hesitated with your answer.  I can barely hear you now. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, really?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  That's even worse.  That's got to mean our ratings suck.  Oh, the numbers here.  We've only got one trend since you guys have been on, so it's nothing yet.  We don't have actual ratings yet.  Yeah, people get confused.  Okay.  Some people get a little confused because we didn't get all these markets at once.  Right.  So they think a market comes in and doesn't show any ratings.  They think, oh, my God, they've been there since April.  It's like, no, we've been here since April.  But other markets we just started in. 
[00:31:00]  Not even a trend for us yet.  So relax and shut up.  Not you.  You know, the people.  What are you guys doing at the station to pass the time?  We're playing video games and making fun of Larry.  Yeah, couldn't you drive home if you had to, though?  I remember some awful, awful snowstorms in Buffalo, and I had to go somewhere, and I just did it.  Well, all the morons that just left their cars in the middle of the road are screwing everything up.  Like, people just abandon their cars.  That's always a good move. 
[00:31:30]  Abandoning the car in the middle of the road.  Yeah.  Oh, the plow comes through.  Yeah, I'm sure the plow will go right around your car, making sure they don't dent it or mess it up at all.  Take the complete left side off.  Absolutely, they will.  That was the best part of living in Buffalo.  After a really, really bad snowstorm, you know, one of these two, three-foot storms.  Yeah.  And when it finally thaws in, like, July, you start driving through these neighborhoods to see the damage the plows do, it is hilarious, man.  Not a mailbox standing, fences gone, curbs gone, shrubs gone. 
[00:32:00]  It hasn't snowed here.  It hasn't snowed here really bad in, like, three years.  We haven't had a really bad snowstorm.  It's going to be the worst winter ever.  That's right.  We've got to make up for the lame hurricane season.  Exactly.  All right, Jim, you're all right, man.  Thanks, guys.  I appreciate it.  You guys are all right, too.  How's Shred doing?  Shred's doing great.  Shred's doing great.  They're starting to kick ass in the afternoons here, too.  So the station's doing, all told, really well. 
[00:32:30]  Right on.  What are you eating, like, crackers and sugar packets from the break room and drinking out of the toilet?  That's exactly what's happening.  One more hour, it's going to be Lord of the Flies.  Good luck to you.  Thank you very much.  All right, Jim, thank you.  Thanks, guys.  All right, bye.  It's 2006.  How long could he be in the dark?  I don't know.  Right?  Okay, yeah, cool.  Another thing that's happening today, of course, it's Friday the 13th. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, boy, is it?  I would never have known watching the news.  Boy, Friday the 13th is just as scary as 9-11.  Ooh.  Oh, no.  A black hat.  I better walk this way.  Don't step under that ladder or break a mirror.  Yeah.  After 9-11, you know what?  You kind of put it in perspective.  You got to retire Friday the 13th.  You really do.  Yeah.  9-11 is the new Friday the 13th. 
[00:33:30]  But, yeah, the news loves bringing it up.  Oh, yeah.  Here's one so far.  Good morning to you.  I'm Lucy Nolan.  It's 530 on this TGIF.  It is Friday the 13th.  What is that?  Trixadekaphobia?  I hope you don't have that.  It's a bad thing if you do for today.  Trix.  Trisk.  Isn't it Triskadekaphobia?  She said Trixadekaphobia.  She also said on this TGIF.  Yeah.  Isn't that wonderful?  Which just pisses me and Than off to no end. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Hey, good morning on this TGIF.  That would be on this, thank God it's Friday.  Right.  What's with the this?  On TGIF, it should be, right?  No.  First of all, don't use it at all, ever.  All right.  Ever.  Oh, I like that.  She should just say, hey, TGIF, everyone.  TGIF this morning.  I'm a fan of Wednesday, because, you know, you're over the hump.  Hump day?  You're over the hump.  On your way to the weekend. 
[00:34:30]  That should have been retired with hump day.  TGIF.  Why don't we play Loverboy?  Working for the weekend.  Yeah.  It's a bad thing if you do for today.  2006 is the year.  Thank you so much for joining us.  News in a moment.  Let's check in with Fox 5, whether it's morning Vanessa Alfano, who is in for Mike Woods.  Morning to you, Vanessa.  Good morning.  I don't have it.  I don't think.  I don't even know what it is.  It's a fear of Friday the 13th.  Okay.  I think it's tricksidekaphobia.  Tricksidekaphobia.  Something like that.  We'll find out.  Good morning, everybody. 
[00:35:00]  Definitely cooler this Friday the 13th.  She's just as big a tool as the one she's replacing.  Where's Mike today?  He took the day off?  He's got the day off.  He's not in.  Jimmy's not in.  Uh-oh.  Can we get Clubstone Kenny on the phone?  We're a little distracted.  We want to make sure our little Jimmy Norton's okay.  We need to know our little Jimmy.  Oh, Jimmy's in route.  Okay.  All right.  Good.  He is.  Yeah, he's in route.  Jimmy will be here.  I'm going to love hearing this story.  By 7 o'clock.  It's going to be a boring one.  You think? 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  I overslept him.  I was out last night.  No, man.  He barely sleeps.  Yeah.  His alarm just didn't go off.  That's all.  He sleeps like from 1 to 5.30.  So he sleeps about four, four and a half hours before he comes in.  I remember the horrifying feeling of sleeping late for work when I used to really work for  living, doing air conditioning and heating, and that was really bad because I'd usually  be out at night tearing it up, and I'd get home and go to sleep, and the alarm, I wouldn't 
[00:36:00]  even remember it going off or anything, but I had apparently hit the snooze, and you kind  of lay there, and you open your eyes and think, wow, it just feels later, or like, I feel like  I've slept more than I should.  I shouldn't feel like this.  There's a definite feeling, and you look at the clock and go.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  And then it's this panicked rush.  You get up about five seconds later.  The blood just, that was supposed to be in your brain isn't there yet, so you get that 
[00:36:30]  head rush, and you got to bend over, and then you're trying to get dressed.  Like, it matters at that point because you're late anyway.  Yeah.  So take your time, but it was rushing, and then trying to call in.  Yeah, I'm going to be late today.  No, it was something with the car.  And they understand it was because you're a lush, and you're out all night.  They just know.  But it's that weird feeling that you wake up, and that's before you look at the clock,  you're just going, I feel a little more well-rested than I should. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  That's 1015.  Oh, Jesus.  I was supposed to be at work an hour ago.  Oh, no.  I should just call in sick altogether.  Yeah.  I got a guy stuck on the thruway.  All right.  Let's go to him.  Let's go to Gary the Trucker.  Gary.  Yeah, go ahead.  You're on the air.  What about you?  Go ahead.  First of all, what are you hauling?  Industrial hazardous waste.  Ooh.  Yeah, nice.  That's a good one.  That's fun when you're on a slippery highway. 
[00:37:30]  I like that going down the thruway.  Oh, yeah.  What kind?  Poison, pesticides, acids.  Where are you taking it?  Taking it to a hazardous waste destruction facility to be destroyed.  Where the hell are these?  What neighborhoods are they putting these in?  Yeah, what lucky...  Would it be in your neighborhood?  What lucky town gets that?  Yeah, where is it?  Cincinnati, Ohio.  Cincinnati, Ohio gets our AIDS. 
[00:38:00]  That's what happened.  Cincinnati, please burn our AIDS for us.  Right.  Yeah, I picked it up in Boston.  Oh, you picked it up in Boston?  Oh, you picked up the AIDS in Boston and you're dropping it off in Cincinnati.  Yeah.  Oh, poor Cincinnati.  All right.  Man, the thruway's been closed for like two, two and a half hours now.  So what do you do?  You just sit in your truck?  Just sit here listening to replays of you guys and wait for you guys to come on.  Letting it idle?  That's when the XM comes in handy, huh? 
[00:38:30]  Oh, man.  Couldn't live without it.  Do you shut it down or let it idle?  Oh, hell no, man.  It's freaking freezing outside.  Yeah.  Let's get right to the heart of the issue here.  Mm-hmm.  Did you, you know, take care of yourself?  No, huh?  A little bored, nothing to do.  Oh, come on, man.  You got a sleeper cab?  Yeah.  Yeah, I do.  Oh, come on.  Everything stands up by itself in there.  When you're bored as a guy, you know, come on.  You'll check out the radio. 
[00:39:00]  The walls of that thing look like a paintball field.  Next thing you know, you're like, ah, what the hell?  Come on.  I'm going to be here a while.  Let's be honest.  Right.  Let's be honest with each other.  Not to say that the thought hasn't crossed my mind several times.  See, that's one thing you don't want to hear, though, as you're doing it, the truck behind you.  Knock, knock.  Like, oh, it's cleared up.  Oops.  Haven't finished yet.  All right.  Hang in there, Gary.  There's going to be a few more flurries in my cab here before I get going.  Yeah.  Have a good morning, guys.  All right. 
[00:39:30]  Let's go to Chris in West Palm.  Chris.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Love the show, man.  Thank you, West Palm.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it's a crisp 90 degrees, so we're looking at those guys up in Buffalo.  Why aren't we broadcasting from West Palm?  90.  90 in West Palm.  There you go, Buffalo.  Well, they're not listening to us in Buffalo.  The power's out.  All right.  Thank you.  Buffalo looks like North Korea this morning.  How about that segue?  I had no idea, Ant.  Ant turned me on to something today I had no clue about.  There's a, what, an aerial photo of Korea? 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, taken a few days ago, a few nights ago, an overlook from one of the satellite pictures  of Korea, North and South.  And South Korea is all lit up.  You can see the major cities.  And just like you would anywhere else in the world, that there's a major city at night  from satellites, you can see the lights.  It's all lit up.  And there's just a distinct line you can see where North and South Korea meet.  And above that line, it's pitch black. 
[00:40:30]  Except for one really bright white dot.  And that's the capital.  And that's where Kim Jong-il resides.  And his huge, warm, well-lit mansion.  Palace.  Palace.  And all the other people.  That's great TV's all over the place.  Oh, yeah.  No one else is allowed to like that.  He's watching his DVDs.  Yeah.  And the rest of the country can go screw.  Is this a propaganda photo?  But they got a nuke. 
[00:41:00]  You're trying to tell me now one guy's sneaking a light bulb on somewhere?  Put a flashlight.  Obviously.  Shining it up at the satellite.  Obviously, the aerial, yeah, the satellite photo wouldn't show that.  But you got to think one guy's brave enough to freaking turn on a light bulb somewhere.  But I think what the story I read was that they actually shut the power off at about  nine o'clock at night to conserve the fuel to run the power stations because they're so  impoverished.  Yeah.  But, you know, he claims to have a nuke that was set off in some abandoned mine and didn't 
[00:41:30]  quite make the boom that everybody was expecting.  So now they're saying that didn't work.  It was a failure.  Yeah.  This guy's just, he's constantly just been bargaining for money.  He doesn't want to work for it.  He doesn't want his people to work for it.  His people aren't motivated because it's that old school communism that doesn't quite work  out.  So, yeah, they sit there in the dark at night.  There he is. 
[00:42:00]  We're going to have to get what's going on with Jimmy after the break because we got to  take a break.  Jimmy has arrived.  Jimmy, give me a yawn.  Oh, sleepy.  My eyes are still fast.  Look at your old puffy.  Oh, it's a good story, too.  Is it a good story?  Of course it's not.  You should have at least said yes so that these dopes would listen a little longer.  It's all about getting these dopes to listen a little longer.  That's our job, to get the dopes to listen a little longer.  Dan in Baltimore, what's up? 
[00:42:30]  What's going on?  Hey, Dan.  Hey, Dan.  Hey, Obi, how can you not sleep with your cell phone on?  What if you oversleep?  I'm definitely afraid of oversleeping every day, and the cell phone's my only source to  the outside world.  Nobody's going to come and pick me up.  I got two alarm clocks, one plugged in the wall, and then I got like a battery alarm  clock that goes off five minutes later.  What?  What did you do in Buffalo when the power went out?  I mean, what do you...  I can't understand.  You did an alarm clock with batteries.  Well, I guess we just...  The wind-up one. 
[00:43:00]  The tick-tocking ones.  My sleep is so valuable that I have to turn off my cell phone.  I have to.  Every morning when I turn it on, there's messages, even though people know that I keep  these hours.  I have to.  I can't do that.  As soon as I'm woken up by the cell phone, then I can't get back to sleep.  I have the cell phone.  The cell phone is my last line of defense.  It's my fail-safe.  I've instructed people here that if I am not in by a quarter after five, that I am to be 
[00:43:30]  called immediately because that is like the fail-safe time.  And that's the time I could actually get up and be here by show time.  Right.  It's a quarter after five.  So if I'm not here by then, I'm supposed to get a phone call.  I have the same rule, but for 632.  Yeah.  Obviously.  Hey, Dan.  Yo.  The cell phone.  What are you going to miss?  It's just ridiculous.  I'll still be late for work, but I mean, at least I won't be like five hours late. 
[00:44:00]  I'll be like an hour late.  But I mean, I can deal with that.  But just out or not, I can't deal with it.  Yeah, I have no problem turning the cell phone off.  No problem.  All right, Dan.  Thank you.  See you guys.  All right.  That didn't go anywhere.  Oh, whatever.  Saget is here.  Has to leave at 720.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Let's take a break.  Bob Saget is here.  Jim Norton is here.  And we'll continue with a lot of other things.  Bob Saget's game show getting rave reviews in the paper today.  Yeah.  Rave reviews.  We'll talk about that for a little bit. 
[00:44:30]  We only get him for 20 minutes.  He's becoming a huge star again.  See what happens?  See.  See what happens?  He's going to have his third huge hit.  Yep.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  The Opie and Anthony Fatty Pig Fatty Contest began like a stampede of hungry rhinos.  But now it more closely resembles a sleepy, winded elephant.  The current heavyweight in the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest is Crystal from Cleveland, who weighed in at 430 pounds. 
[00:45:00]  We're so sure there's someone bigger out there, we put up a fatty finder's fee.  And the amount of $1,000 to the person who brings in the heaviest girl by the end of the contest.  So grab your sonar equipment and find us a whale.  Remember, the heaviest girl at the end of the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest gets $10 for every floorboard-shattering, tear-inducing, self-esteem-destroying pound on her body.  Fat-bottom girls, you make the rockin' world go round.  Go to opieandanthony.com for contest details.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:45:30]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Want to get right back into this.  We got Jim Norton.  He's arrived.  We'll get into what happened.  It's really no big deal, actually.  It's a little oversleeping happening.  And we got to say hi to our new friend, Bob Saget.  Not a new friend anymore.  I think we've been hanging for a while now.  We're old friends, and I've fallen in love with you guys in a viral way.  In a viral way.  Viral.  What's good about viral is you can't really clear it up. 
[00:46:00]  No.  That's true.  It never goes away.  You can't take an antibiotic for a virus.  No, it just kind of pops up when it wants to.  A lot of people do, though.  I hear it's really making super viruses all around the world.  Little viruses with capes.  You can take something for it to knock it down a little bit, but, you know.  But that gives diarrhea.  Does it?  An antibiotic for a virus gives you diarrhea.  You really have to have a biological problem.  Yeah.  Like a thing, like a scrubbing bubble on your face that you can inject with some kind of antibiotic. 
[00:46:30]  But if it's a virus.  Yeah, viruses laugh at antibiotics.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  What are you trying to do to me?  You know, you'll be out with somebody, and they'll have a problem because, you know,  they're taking their SATs the next day.  You guys have been through this, right?  Recently?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's it.  I was with a girl, man.  She was taking her PSATs, and she was really upset.  She had such an outbreak around her mouth, and so I decided to just drop her off at her  locker and head home.  Yeah, you can deal with that, right?  No, I put up with that. 
[00:47:00]  I put down my book bag, and I said, you know.  Are you going on the Today Show today?  Yeah, I'm going from here to the Today Show.  Can you give us, like, a, I don't know, a mention on there?  Like, just work us into the conversation somehow?  I'm going to try, but I know that I'll be making out with Meredith Vieira the whole time.  Oh, well.  And I'm going to get some of that Matt Lauer.  Get a little piece of him, too.  Why not?  Tag team.  Put a pinch of that between your cheek and gum.  Little Matt Lauer.  Little Chaw.  You know, Bob Saget did the ONA Traveling Virus.  So much fun, by the way. 
[00:47:30]  Thank you guys again.  You really did that upright.  I can't wait until next year, because now we're going to take it to the next level.  Although this level was pretty impressive.  Yeah, where do you go then?  I don't know.  Battlestar Galactica.  Actually, I think what we do is we go to a lot more cities, is what we do.  Right.  We're thinking maybe, you know, doubling the dates easily.  I think we'll do at least ten dates next summer.  Ten?  I think so, Ant.  I'm going to need a much bigger garage.  I think so.  I don't look at the shows as cities anymore.  I look at them as vehicles that I can buy. 
[00:48:00]  I just like the fact that I got on stage, and there were, like, strippers backstage, saying  they wanted to, like, pleasure me.  And I said, ooh, I get all my pleasure from the audience.  Thank you.  That's it.  The consummate professional.  I don't want to age you girls with all my old man fluidity.  Yeah.  Where I'm going with this, so we got to hang with, you know, Bob Saget, you know, at these  O&A Traveling Virus shows, and you were talking about this game show, I remember.  Yeah.  And now it's finally here, and the paper's today in New York, anyway, saying it's a huge hit. 
[00:48:30]  We'll see.  I mean, you know, I don't know.  You just don't know, right?  You do the best.  Yeah, you don't know, you know, with all the flops you've had on television.  I've had five pilots that didn't go the past five years.  Yeah?  Yeah.  To a pilot, it doesn't sell.  You know, you write it.  They don't buy it.  All right, here's a question for you.  Everyone knows your hits.  What was the biggest bomb you've done?  I did one for Comedy Central that I loved called Sleep Over with Bob.  I did it like five, six years ago, and I slept over people.  That sounds creepy, by the way.  It was creepy.  It was so creepy it got. 
[00:49:00]  I went to Paris, Texas, because that was a real 25,000 population for the whole city.  Yeah.  Which is the next audience for the virus.  And all in Paris, Texas.  And I was just hanging out there, and I slept in a house of people.  They did not know I was going there, and it was a soccer.  The girl was at soccer camp, and I slept in her bed.  Oh.  And that was creepy.  I thought about it.  And the guy said, just don't sleep with my daughter.  So I went up.  You have to sleep with the pig.  Up in the barn.  So I got a corncob. 
[00:49:30]  And I shucked it.  And I shucked it.  What finally happened?  Comedy Central caught you sniffing the maroon stain in the middle of the bed?  There was nowhere that wasn't the wet spot.  You know what?  It was funny.  I think it was a little bit too, some of it was too PG, and some of it was more R-rated.  And they wanted more R-rated.  I don't know what it was.  It was a funny idea.  There was one person that C-blocked it.  So you would just sleep over people's houses around the house?  Right.  But it really was about hanging out with the town.  Sure. 
[00:50:00]  It was before reality.  Actually, I like the concept.  That's a cute concept.  It seems pretty cool.  I would just kind of like end up in the husband and wife's bedroom with a hammer like Carl.  Just like stand there with a claw hammer.  Carl, what are you doing with that hammer?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Walked into the room.  Some people call it a sling blade.  I call it a Kaiser blade.  Well, you could do that show really short.  I mean, you could get it over in like three minutes.  Yeah. 
[00:50:30]  It would be really quick.  Walked into the room with some Gallagher plastic.  Just hack apart the people that invite you into their homes.  Comedy Central presents the empty crib mysteries.  Oh, wow.  You don't even have to hack them up.  You can just get pillows and just suffocate.  If you're able to overpower the family.  Right.  That adds another little twist to the whole thing.  That's a great twist to the show, Bob.  It's about having no control over your forearms.  Bob Saget comes to your house and tries to kill you.  He smothers one of your children randomly. 
[00:51:00]  How did the show go today, Bob?  I killed everyone.  That was great.  Today was very successful.  We don't even have to edit this.  It's beautiful.  We got the grandma's legs kicking in a wonder.  Oh, my God.  It was like the end of the Wizard of Oz.  The party favor feat is rolled up under the bed.  Oh, is that great?  A little midnight express action smacked the guy's head against the table wall.  Absolutely.  Absolutely watched that.  One versus 100 is a whole different experience.  Oh, yeah.  That show.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:51:30]  All right, let's get to that commercial show.  I got to tell you, I'm a huge fan of Deal or No Deal.  I didn't think I would like Deal or No Deal, but I love it.  I think Howie makes that show.  He's just a great host.  He's a good guy, too.  You can't touch him, but I do full frontal with him.  Yeah.  Well, you start the show by saying something like that, right?  That's what the paper was talking about.  Right.  The first contestant, you're like, don't touch me or something like that.  That's fun of Howie.  Then I mounted him.  Then you mounted him.  I climbed him like a small tree.  Howie's all about the fist.  Yeah, yeah.  He'll take a fist. 
[00:52:00]  But handshakes, no way.  Yeah, no handshake.  You got to tap the fists.  And a lot of people get me confused with that whole thing.  Because sometimes I'll just give somebody the fist touch, the knuckle touch, and sometimes  I'll shake hands.  If I see somebody with these sweaty, nasty hands, I'm not shaking it.  That's correct.  You know where they were.  Right.  You know where yours were, and you know theirs are worse.  Oh, exactly.  So if they're all clammy, you know where they're coming from.  Anthony's not a germaphobe. 
[00:52:30]  He's an anti-Semite.  Right.  I'm an anti-Semite.  I have touched him in everything below the waist.  Exactly.  He does not mind any of that.  I don't mind at all.  With hands, he's insecure.  It's the whole hand thing.  By the way, it is fisting season, so.  Is that true?  Yeah, it is.  No one shakes hands.  Because it's cold and flu.  This time of year, I didn't realize it was that season.  Oh, it's absolutely cold and flu season.  Others call it flu season.  We call it fisting season.  Bob.  You do, do you?  Well, we just made that up, and I kind of like it.  We're going to go wrong with that, I think.  I think it should be yearly. 
[00:53:00]  Well, it's October through Caligula.  You got to get to a new jeweler every week.  Don't come out of my ring, Doc.  Where's the decoder thing?  It came out.  I can't go, woo, anymore, unless I, please talk.  One in a million.  One in a hundred?  Oh, it's a one in a hundred.  One in a million of the rods.  But you can win up to a million?  You can win a million bucks.  All right, that's why I get.  It's amazing the, I actually got into it, which is how Howie told me. 
[00:53:30]  When they offered me the thing, I met with these end of all guys, because of the same producers.  And Howie said, you know, they're really good guys, but he says what's weird is, because he's an acerbic comedian.  He goes off and does his stand-up R-rated and everything.  Yeah.  And he goes, you're going to get involved with these people.  Some guy who's just a working dude who works hard, and here he is, and he's got, like, whatever, 50 grand at stake.  And do you want to go forward or stop?  It's that simple.  And the guy goes forward, and I give him the 50 grand, and then he starts crying.  And then we go back to his room, and then we make out. 
[00:54:00]  It's a trivia show.  Yeah, it's an interesting show.  No, no, no, that's a whole different show.  Oh, okay.  I'm supposed to plug my show, aren't I?  It's the show behind the show.  This is called Mouthful of Shame, the outtakes.  Yeah, you might want to try to promote the show here, Bob.  We're talking to a lot of people that can stab at it.  Sorry, you guys are funny.  Mouthful of Shame.  That'd be funny to me.  But basically.  I actually put my fist in a man's mouth at the end of the show, and then he sings. 
[00:54:30]  Poorly, I would think.  Not well.  Not well.  The set is pretty impressive.  The contestant walks out, and I'm looking at it right now, and he faces this wall of people,  a hundred of them.  A hundred, and they all have electronic number things.  They can choose A, B, or C.  It's like me.  And they got to vote for the best video?  No.  Oh, damn it.  I get confused.  That's when people got hit in the trunk.  A guy with a mullet comes in and tells a lesson to a young child.  That's not that.  That was before.  Oh, God, I confuse your show.  And the music comes in the synth string.  Right. 
[00:55:00]  No, it's not that.  Daddy gives a nice speech.  No, the youngest you're getting the lesson is the Mark Carr tape.  No, this is a whole different thing.  This is very simple, you know.  Okay.  I kept saying, this game is simple, and then people made that my hook phrase and started applauding  that because I couldn't explain the game.  That's great.  It takes many views.  Watch it for a few minutes, and you know what the game is.  It's just, you know, if you get it wrong, you're out.  Yeah.  That's it.  It's that simple.  But it's you against the hundreds. 
[00:55:30]  So out of the hundred people, whoever gets the trivia question wrong, they're out of the game.  Immediately.  As long as you got the, you the contestant got the, you know, the correct answer.  You keep going.  Right.  You keep going.  And then as soon as they lose, if they lose and get one wrong, whatever's left in that  group of a hundred, say 30 people are left, they'll split whatever money he was getting  at that point.  So if he had, okay, you're up to a hundred grand, and he's out, he guesses wrong that  no, Caligula was not the place where he lost his watch.  Then you would go to, okay, those 30 people are going to split that hundred grand that he 
[00:56:00]  just won.  Right.  So that's a lot.  It's dough no matter what.  So the hundred people are also contestants?  Yeah.  I was going to say, where the hell did you find a hundred people?  Where do you find consistently find a hundred people?  It's actually middle of the earth.  Is that it?  A bunch of people.  There's a monorail and a chute that automatically jenis them into these cubicles.  It's very futuristic.  Because I'm looking at that wall, as Ope said, it's up, and my God, it's gigantic.  It's all walks of life, basically. 
[00:56:30]  You got mobsters, you got models, you got other game show contestants.  You got the Jeopardy guy.  Ken Jennings and millionaire people.  I hate that Jeopardy guy.  Oh, is that it?  You got some celebrities up there or something?  Not celebrities.  Just people with Mensa members, and Ken Jennings was a celebrity.  So like real smart people up there.  And then you got wrestlers and beauticians.  And some dummies, okay.  Four mannequins.  What's the chance of cardboard cutouts?  What's the chance of getting some waterheads up there? 
[00:57:00]  I'd love a waterhead.  A couple waterheads just as a goof factor?  You can do all that.  You can do someone who has an elephant man syndrome, get about four of those up there,  and go, every answer is, I am not an animal.  Every single answer.  And then his head hits the mic because he can't hold the weight.  How far will they allow you to take this?  I say all the way to death.  This corpse is up there.  It's a rollerball.  So the main contestant guy is like, he's kind of in the middle there.  Yeah, he's in the center of the whole thing. 
[00:57:30]  It's like ancient Rome, futuristic.  And your role is to do what?  Move it along as quickly as possible and not be dirty.  Oh, right.  That's the difference.  Good luck.  And he gets asked a question?  Yes.  It's very, you know, it's just like Millionaire.  Same thing, except the odd, and then there's a hundred people more behind me that are in  blue light because they're going to cook them.  They're in the blue light special.  I can see that, the blue light people.  But then you move, you know, as soon as a contestant gets it wrong, the person next to 
[00:58:00]  me, then you've got to change out that contestant and the people in the mob that got it wrong  have to leave.  So you've got to climb all the way up to this.  Wow.  It's a huge looking thing.  How do they determine who got it right and wrong?  They have, what, do they have bracelets or something?  Yeah, they have a shock thing around their neck.  That would be great.  Yeah.  They actually have just A, B or C.  Taser the Losers would be hilarious.  It's just like at home you'd go, what are they doing?  It's B.  What's wrong with them?  It's that simple.  They hit A, B, or C.  And there's a couple of like lifeline-like things you can ask the contestants for help.  It's very, very straightforward. 
[00:58:30]  Anthony said it recently.  Eventually we're going to have a game show about a coin toss.  Yeah.  Right.  Heads.  And we'll make that interesting.  Or tails.  Well, I think both of those words are interesting anyway.  Yes, true.  So I would watch that show.  Because deal or no deal is just plain stupid.  But I love it.  The fact that they made that work is genius.  It really is.  What's in the briefcase?  It sounds like, what's in the box?  The head from Seven, you know?  What's in the briefcase?  Oh my God, you went and did it, you know? 
[00:59:00]  And Howie, I love Howie.  I mean, I've known him for like 28 years.  Right.  It makes me like, you guys must have started together.  We did.  He was in Canada.  I was working yuck yucks.  And he was, you could hold his hand then.  We would always hold hands.  Yeah.  That's probably what stopped him from wanting to hold people's hands.  It always moves to something further, doesn't it?  Well, I make out next.  I did Tough Crowd with Howie, and they stuck me on the couch with him, and then Colin told  him I had AIDS.  And you've never seen a man cower in the corner of his sofa.  So horribly.  Away from you?  Oh, yeah.  Bob, let's get down to the real question I want to ask today. 
[00:59:30]  Is this it for us as friends, now that you've got a huge hit on your hands?  Opposite.  You guys believed in me when my grandmother abandoned me, left me in that shopping cart  when I was nothing but a hairy little baby that had to be waxed to stay alive and breathe.  No, I love you guys.  I had so much fun on that virus tour.  Yeah, it was a blast.  I mean, it really was.  When you do something like that, and it's all comedians like Jim and all the guys that 
[01:00:00]  did it, it's like your friends.  It's a pit bull situation.  You know what's cool about Bob, too?  He couldn't do the Cleveland show, so he did a video.  He didn't have to do a video for the Cleveland show.  And by the way, your video killed.  You're kidding.  Killed up there.  Should I have not shown my lower parts in it?  You did like four or five minutes, and you just killed.  Ah, thank you.  I curse for the kids, and they seem happy.  Yeah, they love it.  I performed at University of South Carolina the other night, and it astounds me how some  girl was flashing her chest at me and stuff. 
[01:00:30]  And then I...  Amazing.  I'm like a rock star now.  She's like a kid.  That's wrong.  Yeah.  She's like a kid.  It's college.  Like a kid.  But she's a woman.  Right.  I have a girlfriend now.  You do?  Yeah.  Aww.  Yeah.  That's adorable.  She was saying that just the other night.  No, she's good.  She's a good girl.  Loved her mama.  Loved Jesus in America, too.  I'm dating Tom Petty.  You know, he's got beautiful hair.  Tom Petty?  Yes.  I saw him doing a concert.  It's gorgeous hair.  It's a suit. 
[01:01:00]  Lush.  It's lush.  It's full.  And I know he blows it out.  Shiny.  It is.  Good.  It has a sheen to it.  Is your girlfriend younger?  Pardon me?  Is your girlfriend younger?  Well, there's an amber lurd out for her right now.  That's any clue.  Most of the earth is younger than me.  No, it's impossible.  They say you're supposed to divide your age in half and then add seven, and I'm subtracting  seven and not carrying the one.  Wow.  My harbor line, as soon as there's no grass on the field, play ball.  I don't think that's polite.  That's the math they should be teaching in school, I'm thinking. 
[01:01:30]  It's either illegal or she has cancer.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Hey, Greg in New York, what's up?  You know, I can't wait to hear this material on the Today Show.  Yeah.  Because I'm sure it's going to sound just like this interview.  What they're going to do is, they're very nice people.  I'm sure they're going to say, you know, and you have a very naughty mouth.  Naughty?  No, no.  Naughty, naughty.  You're obviously more comfortable doing this than those dumb TV shows, right?  Well, I mean, you just go through the process.  Let's be honest.  I'm trying to do that as well as I can do it, because I still like it. 
[01:02:00]  I like the idea of being a company man and trying to get in and then do something subversive.  Well, you're proven that you can do that, and you do it well, you know.  Well, the video show I make jokes was so goofy, I couldn't really get anything by.  But this thing, I'm 50 now, and they're kind of like, they kind of trust me.  By the time I got to the third or fourth episode, which we shot five of them, of this one versus 100.  You're cursing people out.  What is wrong with you?  Dropping the F-bomb on people.  Heathen.  May you die for what you do.  Punching contestants. 
[01:02:30]  I'm the god of hellfire.  It's Bob Saget.  You've got to let him punch the contestants.  He needed to urinate.  Right there on the floor.  He doesn't care.  My show, damn it.  Bob, I can't hold my mud me longer.  No, she got it.  I'm not saying that.  I'm saying I got to be a little more PG, and I got to be the...  It's kind of fun.  I get to say some stuff.  Like, we cut to the money.  They had to cut it out, because we changed things differently.  But I went, you know, that's the money shot.  And on television, that's very important to have the money shot. 
[01:03:00]  No, they kind of were leaving it in, but we didn't need it for the show.  Oh, okay, okay.  So as we get through it, there'll be things that you guys will watch and go, eh, it's  funny that he did that, I think.  Bob, you've been around a long time.  When you know the show is on the downslide, then you've got to really mess it up and go  out like in a ball of fire.  A blaze of glory.  Just drop your pants.  Wear a diaper.  Leakage.  Just do something just over the top.  Start dancing in my own poo.  Hey, before we let you go to the Today Show, Greg in New York has a question for you.  Greg.  Hey, what's up, B-O-N-A? 
[01:03:30]  Hey.  Hey, man.  That would be bored often, Anthony.  Hey, Bob.  Yeah, man.  You're an awesome addition.  Love you.  Thank you.  You know what, but the little references with the little boys and the little girls, I don't  know whether to laugh or whether to call the cops.  Yeah, I agree with you.  You don't have to worry about me.  I've got three daughters, and I'm very, very safe.  But, you know, if you've got to call them, call them.  Ooh, I invented that.  Let's go to Leslie in Boston.  Leslie.  That guy's one of my biggest fans.  Leslie.  Hello. 
[01:04:00]  Make it fast, because he's got to go on TV.  Okay, I just wanted to say I'm a sixth-grade English teacher in Massachusetts, and I gave the  students a prompt to write about who inspires them the most.  Thank you.  And most kids wrote about their parents or, you know, a friend, and I had one girl turn  in an essay all about Bob Saget.  Was it okay?  Yeah.  She thinks you're hilarious, and she thought you were cute and had nice hair, and I'm just  thinking to myself, if she only knew what a sick guy this guy really was. 
[01:04:30]  Well, no, but the truth of it is I have, like, I hate that.  I get upset with myself that people perceive that, because I am a, this is the weird part.  I'm kind of like, I am a family guy, so if there's, like, kids, I would never do that.  I mean, I forgot I'm on the radio just now, because I got comfortable.  But I, when there's kids, you know, a lot of kids watch Full House, and they'd say, you  know, I lost my mom, and my dad and I would watch Full House, and we would, it was a great  show for us.  And then I, I would never say anything stupid or gross or fake pervy, but I think that's,  like, really sweet. 
[01:05:00]  That messes up my head for having said anything naughty, so.  Yeah, I just thought it was funny, because in my mind, I thought it was a virus show.  Do you, do you have her number?  Yeah.  Did she have a, did that redeem me at all?  Does she, does she have, does she have a mouth face?  Has she ever worn a wig?  She's one of my special ed students, too, if that's what I'm saying.  Oh, thank you.  You know what, why don't you hang up right now?  She's a six-way.  She's 41.  She's 41.  Yeah, it's okay.  There you go.  That's why it's okay.  I apologize.  You realize it's just like me being 14 and being stupid.  Yeah. 
[01:05:30]  Well, that's really nice.  Would you do me a favor and tell her that I appreciate it?  And my hair is a lot shorter now.  It was kind of blown out in a bouffant back in the day.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you so much.  All right, we got to get Bob out of here.  You got to see a report on someone written in crayon.  I feel terrible now.  Why?  I don't know.  Why don't you stop?  Bob, you'll get over it.  What?  You'll get over it.  Number one, I don't know what you're talking about.  Exactly.  We see right through you.  I'm going out to my lipstick in a go-go wig.  I'm going to get ready for my next fan. 
[01:06:00]  What time are you on?  We're going to watch you.  Eight o'clock.  Yeah, we're going to watch.  What time is the show on?  It's called...  One in a Million?  One Versus 100.  Oh, one verse...  Hey, this is weird.  Why do I keep saying one in a million?  One versus a hundred.  I'm sorry.  Maybe it'll turn into that.  Because it's going to be a million contestants.  Wow, that would be some studio.  It'd be in a parking lot.  It would be Friday night tonight at nine o'clock and then...  On NBC.  On NBC and then next week it starts for four weeks at eight o'clock, which is the old Full 
[01:06:30]  House time spot.  Oh, they dusted that time slot off for you.  There are people out there that are still sitting in front of the TV waiting because Full  House ended ten years ago.  Finally, there's something with Danny Tanner on it on NBC.  There's someone sitting there just going, tuning in, going, maybe it's today.  Maybe they'll be back today.  Oh, my God.  Oh, look, it's him.  But it's different.  But it's different.  There's other people.  Have you figured out how many times Full House runs every day? 
[01:07:00]  Because it seems like when I turn on the TV, no matter when, there's a Full House episode.  It's on both Nick at Night and ABC Family every day.  Somewhere in the world, except for North Korea, it is playing every night, everywhere.  Somewhere Michelle is being told you can't have a horse in the living room.  Yeah.  Is that Sean in England?  You're all over the world, right?  All over the world.  Wow.  It's in countries that don't speak what I say.  Creepy house full of men with children.  I know.  A lot of Arab countries.  Just, oh.  It looked like Abba's house. 
[01:07:30]  The daughters are all blonde and perfect.  I come in with a dust buster.  Straightest guy ever on TV.  My own daughter asked me if I was gay on the show.  And I said, no.  And I said, I had a girlfriend.  She said, yeah, I saw you with the girlfriend.  Was your character gay on the show?  It was like the least sexual.  Because the show was geared for 12-year-olds.  Yeah, you were really, like, asexual.  Yeah.  Pretty much everybody was on that show.  When that's Nemos, he would walk in and go, hey, look alive.  Uncle Jesse. 
[01:08:00]  Uncle JJ.  Yeah, he was supposed to be the womanizer and everything.  But, I mean, did you really ever see him do anything?  Well, he did.  He was married and he had two kids.  Exactly.  Never saw it.  Exactly.  Wanted to see.  They were in bed together upstairs in the attic.  And he had a tank top on and Lori Loughlin had sweats.  Ooh.  Wow.  Yeah.  Hot.  That's more than Lucy and Desi ever got away with.  Yeah.  Separate beds.  Yeah.  And these two look good together.  You know, that was a Jesse and Becky.  Handsome couple.  Handsome.  And I had the dust buster and the dog.  Let's get Bobby out of here.  All right.  Or Bob. 
[01:08:30]  Thank you, guys.  Bob Saget, of course.  Call me, Bob.  Always a pleasure, man.  One versus a hundred on tonight.  NBC at nine o'clock.  Nine o'clock.  Then starting next week for four weeks, it's on Friday nights at eight o'clock on NBC.  It's getting rave reviews.  Check it out tonight.  Three stars, man.  Three out of four.  Yeah.  That's unusual.  Not bad, huh?  It really is.  Who did I not offend this time?  Not bad.  Oh, I got the Penguin movie coming out.  And I'll be back for sure because I got to promote that.  But you can see the trailer on farceofthepenguins.com.  And it's an R-rated trailer.  Can we get like an advanced copy? 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  I'm going to get you everything.  So you're going to see it.  It's Sam Jackson narrates it.  And it's Penguins having sex.  It's a takeoff on the...  Penguins on the plane.  He kind of does that.  He's very funny.  It's a takeoff on the Penguin movie that we all saw?  Yeah.  They go 70 miles.  They eat a piece of fish and then they have sex.  It's Louis Black.  Louis Black, Tracy Morgan, Monique, Christina Applegate, and myself are the main five voices.  And then Sam Jackson narrates.  How piece of cake is the cartoon gig?  Is it just like get in a studio and the money? 
[01:09:30]  They're pouring money.  If you get your parts done, you should be in a booth full of cash.  Well, it's not a cartoon.  It's stock footage.  Oh, stock footage.  And there's no money in Farce of the Penguins.  It was done by Think Film who did The Aristocrats.  I thought maybe you were making a boatload of money.  Because you talk to someone like Leary who's got those goddamn prehistoric thing.  Ice Age.  Ice Age, right, right.  Right.  And he just talks about your boatloads of cash.  Yeah, they boat it up.  Well, this could be that.  If people love it, you know, they come and see it.  People go see it. 
[01:10:00]  If people see it.  Get a piece of it.  And love it.  I would say I have a taste.  That's nice.  Speaking of TV shows really fast, have you seen 30 Rock yet with Tracy Morgan?  I haven't, and I want to.  He's a friend of mine.  I heard it.  He's like himself, though.  Finally.  That's what I was getting at.  I love him so much.  He's the Tracy Morgan we saw on the tour.  Oh, he's a good?  I haven't seen it.  He's hilarious in it.  He's hilarious.  He is hilarious in 30 Rock.  Yeah.  I really, really enjoyed that show.  And I saw Tina Fey the other day.  She's brilliant.  I mean, it's a good show.  I got to see it. 
[01:10:30]  But Tracy's just acting like himself.  Shirt comes off.  Oh, yeah.  All that.  Just beyond funny.  Pants.  He's like, I can't help it, Bob.  It's who I am.  And I know.  It's him in a strip club.  I'm just really good stuff.  Really good stuff.  He loves just taking his clothes off.  Pulling his pants down.  It's what he's about.  Yeah.  All right.  Stuff.  It's extra props.  Bob, they're going to get mad at us.  All right.  I got to go.  Yeah.  Bob Saget.  One versus a hundred tonight at nine o'clock on NBC.  All right.  Thank you.  Always a pleasure, Bob.  Thanks, Bob.  Thank you.  It's Bob Saget.  We'll continue.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[01:11:00]  I can walk on my hands.  I can fart and chew gum.  I play the ONA.  I can ride a unicycle.  I wear a bra and laced panties.  So your talent is being queer, Travis?  It's the O.P. and Anthony Walkover Talent Show.  If you have a unique skill, talent, music group, or physical affliction, we want to exploit.  You can email steve at foundrymusic.com with your ideas, or you can just show up during  the walk to XM and start shucking and jiving.  Shucking and jiving? 
[01:11:30]  Jesus, Danny.  I don't write this sh**.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  That's it here.  I want to thank Bob Saget for stopping by.  He's going to be on the Today Show in a few minutes.  Eight o'clock, I guess.  We'll have to watch and make fun of him.  Yeah.  Because that's what we do.  He's going to be a little tamer.  A little?  For the Today Show?  He's got to be, he's got to go in a time machine back ten years and make believe he was 
[01:12:00]  the cacti he played on television.  That's it.  They don't know him as, you know, the dirty Bob Saget.  He's perfect for the show, by the way.  Perfect.  Yeah.  All right.  It's Friday the 13th.  Oh.  Ah.  Trish-deck-phobia.  Ugh.  Do you have trish-deck-phobia?  That's the fear of the number 13.  Exactly.  Is it?  Stop.  Yes.  I have that fear because, well, let's just say Roman Polanski should have. 
[01:12:30]  Oh.  Well, the news is all over Friday the 13th today.  Let's see what witty things they have to say today.  Beware, today is Friday the 13th and in English and Portuguese-speaking cultures, the day is  associated with bad luck and there are statistics to back it up.  Researchers estimate between $800 and $900 million are lost in business each Friday the 13th.  But that's due to people who won't work or travel. 
[01:13:00]  There are normally two Friday the 13ths a year.  The next one is April of 2007.  Yeah, well, I'm flying today.  Wonderful.  I don't need to hear that before you complain.  No left turns, Jimmy.  No left turns today, all right?  Yeah.  I won't be making it.  By the way, Ant, congratulations.  Yes.  You nailed it.  Yes, they're starting to say that the plane crash was caused by a pilot error.  It didn't have enough room.  He went for a left turn.  Went for a left turn.  The wind was blowing in that direction. 
[01:13:30]  An experienced pilot.  Well, he was heading into restricted airspace and he needed to make a left turn to head back.  Back downriver.  And instead of maybe going right a little bit and then coming around left, he just made a left.  The wind hits the bottom of the plane because you're banked over a little bit.  Whoosh.  If you're turning and you got a crosswind like that and you turn and now you got a tailwind, 
[01:14:00]  oh, your turn's going to be so much wider than if you're turning into the wind.  It's just natural, you know?  And he wound up going into a building.  Well, according to this, you know, the front of the post, his son was six.  Tearful son defends pilot Corey.  Not dad's fault.  How old is the kid?  Well, kid, six.  Six.  His fault was it?  The buildings?  Of course it was your dad's fault.  He watches cartoons, so he thinks the building should have gotten up and lifted its dress up  and gone, ooh, and the plane should have gone between its legs and flown out the other side. 
[01:14:30]  You know how cartoons are and little kids love them?  Wow.  He doesn't understand, poor little feller.  Yeah, well, all right.  Bad love to her.  He's a good boy.  Hey, Channel 11.  Well, now they call themselves CW.  I don't know what that even means.  Wasn't the WB working for them?  Apparently not.  No.  They had to change to the CW. 
[01:15:00]  There was UPN, there was WB, now it's the CW.  The CW.  What does it even stand for?  I don't know.  Country Western?  No one knows what it means.  What does it mean?  Except Than.  Of course Than knows.  What does it mean?  I think I have a Jolly Rancher.  Oh, do you?  Jolly Rancher.  Hurry up.  I've got to tend to the horses.  I think it's a hybrid between, like, CBS and WB.  It's a hybrid?  A joint venture thing.  Really?  Yes.  Between CBS and WB? 
[01:15:30]  I'm getting a thumbs up from the booth on that, yeah.  Wait, wait.  So we shouldn't make fun of the CW?  From the incredible bearded woman in the booth?  That's stupid beard.  His beard is growing at an alarming rate.  It's creepy.  Are you getting a little self-conscious of all the woman jokes?  And he's making up for it by growing a Rip Van Winkle beard?  He is growing the fullest beard I've ever seen in my life.  It really is. 
[01:16:00]  It's amazing.  No one else in this whole place can grow a beard like his.  No.  Not even close.  Well, maybe Bill.  Oh, yeah.  Bill's going to be up there.  Pretty big beard.  How long are you going to let it go?  Yeah, you don't know?  Travis we're talking about.  Yeah, Travis, of course.  The lovely Travis.  Huh?  It's been eight weeks.  Eight weeks?  That's eight weeks?  Do you trim it?  Do you have a beard trimmer?  You just trim the neck?  That's it?  I use the groomsman.  Dude, let's see how big this thing can get, man.  Are you going for that or what? 
[01:16:30]  Go for, like, one of those big biker beards.  Yeah, we can do that.  Have you ever had a beard before?  Just when I'm too lazy to show you.  When he was seven.  Is it your first time?  Well, no.  I used to shave, like, once a week just because who do I have to impress here?  Yeah.  Now I'm just letting it go.  Yeah.  All right.  No reason.  Nah.  Just for the winter.  Keep your face warm.  Just to look good.  Grizzly Adams.  That doesn't keep your face warm, though.  No, it doesn't.  Of course not.  Grizzly hair.  Myth.  All right. 
[01:17:00]  Call in if you're growing a full beard.  No.  Don't.  These dolts actually will.  All right.  More Friday the 13th crap from the CW.  It's a day for those who are superstitious.  Many fear if they lose their job or smash their car today.  It's all because it's Friday the 13th.  Am I correct here?  Yeah.  All right.  Julie Chang is live in Cybersil to tell how many residents still believe Friday the 13th is cursed.  Julie?  I was trying.  I absolutely dumbfounded right now. 
[01:17:30]  I don't even know how to start this story because what was that?  I don't know.  I wanted a Freddy's ski mask.  I wanted a Freddy's ski mask, but they gave me this.  It's like a bank robbery broke out.  Yeah.  Dumb bro.  We finally got a new clip to play with.  It's about time.  All right.  Why do you got cooking in your oven over here?  Exactly.  He's horrid.  The most unsexy woman ever. 
[01:18:00]  I guess she was wearing a ski mask for Friday the 13th on live TV.  Oh, I get it.  Because they're wanting to be Freddy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I feel like she should be shoveling driveways.  Good morning to you guys.  Actually, maybe it is not a good day.  Wow.  It's Saturday the 13th, and they just opened up the gates to the cemetery, so I really better  wash my back because anything can happen.  Now, many of you may be shaking your heads at home because maybe you think Friday the 13th 
[01:18:30]  and other superstitions are just plain old silly, but we've got some facts to back it up.  The British Medical Journal once reported that the risk of hospital admission as a result of a transport accident  may be increased by as much as 52% on Friday the 13th.  I know.  The find is startling.  Startling, that is.  And it's even worth a scream.  For centuries, Friday the 13th has been doomed.  I'm just cautious, a little cautious.  And a Gallup poll says that some Americans are still superstitious. 
[01:19:00]  About 9% believe that Friday the 13th is, in fact, jinxed.  And out of the superstitions, 14% worry about a black cat crossing your path, and 12% prefer  to avoid walking beneath a ladder.  And 4% think breaking a mirror is seven years of bad luck.  It's not a cat that you've got to worry about.  Exactly.  I hate superstitious people.  Yeah. 
[01:19:30]  I just hate them.  Wow, really?  I only leave the house to decide.  Really?  You do?  Yeah, they are kind of crazy.  Although I've got a couple of things that I don't do as much as I used to.  Like, I used to have to knock wood all the time.  It's like, oh, jinx it.  That's like the anti-jinx thing.  I dare my plane to crash.  Wow.  You're flying today?  I dare it to crash.  You're flying today?  Yeah.  Where are you flying to?  Jacksonville, Florida, Continental.  And then off to Cuba?  Tomorrow morning, the military gets me. 
[01:20:00]  Sometime tomorrow.  I have to do my show tomorrow.  Oh, boy.  Wait, wait.  Then you're on a military plane?  Yes.  Oh, they go down all the time.  Over to, uh...  GB, Guantanamo Bay, Gitmo.  I'm doing a show for Al-Qaeda.  Ah!  Jimmy's going to have some great stories next week.  It'll probably be, uh...  First time in Cuba, right?  Sure, yeah.  I know Jeffrey Ross sneaks in somehow.  That's who I'm going with.  We won't get to see any of the Cubans.  We'll be on the military base.  You're going to the military base, yeah. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, I've been Tony Woods, who's a very funny comment from DC.  You'll be seeing some Cubans.  They'll sneak you out.  You're going to be checking out Cuba, my friend.  Yes.  I don't think you're allowed.  I don't know.  They'll figure it out.  I hope so.  I'm going to go meet Fidel.  I think you've got to stay in the compound.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's America.  That's actually American territory right there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I hope they fly us, uh...  Because military planes can be...  It can be a slow flight if they put you on a little plane.  It can be like a three-hour flight.  Nah, they're going to swoop you right in, Jimmy.  I hope so. 
[01:21:00]  Big star like you.  Yeah.  Give me a swooping, Jeff.  I want a good swooping from you.  Hey, do you guys want to know what the origin of Friday the 13th  is?  Finally.  We said earlier, I mean, after 9-11, you've got to retire the Friday the 13th thing.  I understand people not going to work on 9-11 every year now, but, you know,  missing work because it's Friday the 13th?  Stop it.  How about this?  Anyone who missed work because it was missing work because any non-holiday day,  she just had their face slapped.  Ooh.  I can't have to mention, I've had some bad experiences on Friday the 13th 
[01:21:30]  and seen some freaky things happen.  So you haven't noticed anything bad happening on today more than others?  Well, except for the accident on the corner over there, nothing.  While the origin of the superstition is murky, many believe Friday got its negative reputation  after Jesus was crucified on a Friday.  Bad for him.  The 13th may also root back to the biblical times.  At the Last Supper, there were 13 people, and Judas, the one to betray Jesus, was the  13th attendant.  What if he was the 7th?  Don't that thing happen on other days, too? 
[01:22:00]  But it seems like quitted it.  Maybe he had to go to the bathroom and he happened to get in the room late.  Yeah.  Tuesday the 6th, it would have been.  I don't think.  I hate when they play with numbers.  They were playing with numbers with this Corey Lytle plane crash.  The upside down thing.  So one of the news stations actually went with that.  Did they run with that one?  Yes.  Ew.  They did?  Yes.  That's not news.  On other days, too?  Well, it seems like coincidence will happen worse on Friday the 13th.  It's out of the clear blue. 
[01:22:30]  Or maybe you just noticed it more because it's the 13th.  What do you think?  Could be.  Believe in whatever you want to believe in.  And if it works for you, it works for you.  But I think...  I guess in this case, it doesn't work for you.  No, it doesn't.  Why do they...  Why do they spend time on this?  I don't know.  They have nothing else to do.  You know, if they're going to go this route on the news...  How do we hate the news?  If they're going to go this route with the local news, hire a comedy writer. 
[01:23:00]  Why don't you just hire a writer?  There you go.  Go to the distance.  You have to do these wacky stories and try to, you know, come up with some cute things about it.  Get a writer.  Get yourself a writer.  In that story, she actually said a Freddy ski mask.  It's called a Freddy Krueger mask.  It's not even a mask.  It's Freddy's face.  Freddy don't wear a mask.  Right.  But she called it a Freddy ski mask.  A Friday the 13th is a Jason mask.  She meant to say a Jason hockey mask.  Which is a hockey mask.  Right.  So she got it wrong twice.  She completely screwed that up. 
[01:23:30]  A Freddy ski mask.  What is he, in Colorado, murdering people?  Right.  On the slopes of Aspen skiing.  He's swishing down.  All right.  We only have 30 more seconds.  Then we can finally move on.  You got to hear the nip-tuck thing that they had on TV.  I can't believe they got away with this.  We'll do that.  And also, you know how we were talking about the dominatrix and the businessman?  Yeah.  There's a real story about that.  It's not a businessman, but it's right down the same alley we were talking about the other day.  Oh, I love that story.  I feel your fear on this day. 
[01:24:00]  Some have linked Charles Manson, Jeffrey Dahmer, and Jack the Ripper, all serial killers, for having 13 letters in their name.  Oh, my God.  They also warned that getting married and traveling and starting a new job on this day is bad luck.  Sukanya and Craig, what do you guys think?  I don't know.  I've never...  Besides Suki, she should shovel someone's driveway.  What do you guys think?  You know what?  Did you know my parents tortured me all my life shoveling that driveway?  I did.  I did.  My brothers did it. 
[01:24:30]  I did.  With the girl.  The trials of Suki.  Did she take a left turn there into a building?  What?  Suki.  How did this subject...  Wow.  Oh, the ski mask.  Suki.  The Jason ski mask.  What happened?  Because she started the report wearing that dumb ski mask.  Yeah.  So it came full circle back around to the shoveling driveway.  Oh, God.  This is what's on the news this morning.  I want you to spun the ski mask around, and before she could see what was happening, smashed her in the face with the snow shovel. 
[01:25:00]  All right.  That never solved anything.  Although that was mean, what I said.  Yeah.  We're being too mean.  Yeah, let's be nice.  Some people think we're being too mean.  When we get back, girl dumped in ditch after dying during sex.  And a nip-tuck clip.  Peanut butter treats.  Peanut?  Peanut butter.  Peanut.  Peanut.  Peanut butter treats. 
[01:25:30]  Uh-oh.  And a dog, yeah.  Oh, no.  Yeah, they talked about that on nip-tuck.  There isn't even any other way that can go.  It's like peanut butter dog.  There's no other story.  No.  There's no other story when it involves a peanut butter and a dog.  You sure?  Let's think for a second.  I'm trying to.  Let's think.  Peanut butter.  No.  And a dog.  I was even trying to think.  I think he stepped in it and tracked it through the house.  But the jar opening is too small.  Peanut butter. 
[01:26:00]  Peanut butter and a dog.  Unless the dog is smiling and you have peanut butter on your face.  The audio is unbelievable.  We'll get into that next, okay?  You've got your lipstick in my peanut butter.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe. 
[01:26:30]  It's the O.B. and everybody show.  Yeah, let's get right back into the show.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  Big star.  Big star on the hotline here.  Got to say hi to Chaz.  Chaz Palminter.  That's right.  Chaz.  How are you?  How are you?  There he is.  Look, how are you?  How are you?  That's the voice.  Nice.  A real star.  Oh, thank you.  Finally.  Thank you for calling in. 
[01:27:00]  I've actually met you.  My name is Jim.  You probably don't remember it, or you probably blocked it out.  I did what is arguably the worst table read in the history of show business I did with  you.  Doug Davidoff brought me, and we did it.  It was for a very funny sitcom about the 50s.  Right.  You were awful, Jimmy.  I remember that.  No, that was fun.  Come on.  You were great, but I remember I was just so ashamed, because I was very nervous to read 
[01:27:30]  with, obviously, an actor of your...  No, you were fine.  You were terrific.  No, I don't say that.  I'm great.  Mr. Palminteri can now sleep tonight, because Jim has told him, no, you were great.  Yeah, I know.  Almost like...  But he blocked it out.  You could tell it was a really good script, and my read was so bad, he actually blocked  out the entire day and pretended it never happened.  Now he's like, oh my God, that was real.  No, they're just table reads.  That's just for the writers to hear the words. 
[01:28:00]  I remember that.  No, it worked out...  It really worked out good.  Don't feel that way.  What happened with the show?  It was a really funny script.  Yeah, no, it never really sold.  You know, it was just...  You know, sometimes when something's too good, Hollywood can't take it.  You know, they want crap.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Wow.  They do tend to.  A little jaded?  Yeah.  No, not jaded.  I'm not jaded at all.  Sometimes television, you've got to go a certain formula.  It was so out of the box that they just couldn't see it.  But that happens.  What are you going to do?  Have you done any type of TV series before?  I mean, obviously, everyone knows you from Bronx Town for films. 
[01:28:30]  Have I done a TV series before?  Yeah.  Yeah, I was on a series called Kojak for a little bit with Ving Rhames that I did.  But I might be doing another one soon again.  I wrote another one, so we'll see if we're going to do that.  Is that like a goal?  Because most movie guys don't seem to want to do TV.  They kind of like, they look down on it.  Is that something you want to do or just something you would consider as like an option?  I don't, you know, it used to be that way.  You know, they used to feel that way.  They don't, they're not that way anymore.  I mean, because you can still do television and still go right back to films. 
[01:29:00]  You know, I really like to be home.  I like to stay home.  I don't like to travel so much.  So in films, you travel a lot, you know.  I mean, I love making movies and I enjoy it.  But I would like to do a series.  But I'd like to do it on cable where you only do 13 episodes.  So I still have most of the year to do a movie.  But I like it.  A lot more freedom there, too.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Yeah, cable, obviously, on network, they seem to really, they still, it's amazing.  Like, even with the success of cable shows, network still seems to kind of want to just tie you up  and not let you get away with anything remotely edgy.  Well, that's exactly right. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, I mean, networks, they have, it's more like 26 episodes, 24 episodes,  and you're tied up the whole year, you know.  And it's, and really in cable, like in HBO and Showtime and FX,  you're really allowed to stretch and do different things and say, you know,  it's much more freedom as an artist.  Does it bother you, like, I mean, obviously, you've done so many great things  and everybody really knows you.  I mean, the main thing they know you from is a Bronx tale.  Do you hate being tied to one piece of work like that as much as that one is kind of tied to you?  Not at all, you know.  In fact, I'm very flattered by that because how can I not be, you know. 
[01:30:00]  I mean, I wrote it.  You wrote it, yeah.  It was a play originally, and it's really a lot about my life.  So it's, you know, it was kind of a testament to my mom and dad and my father, the working man.  So not at all.  I mean, they teach in film schools.  They do a lot of studying of the script of a Bronx tale, and I'm just flattered by that.  And I go in and I do these lectures on the script, and you know what?  It was a great piece of work, and, you know, I'm flattered to be tied to it. 
[01:30:30]  Did you find that hard going from a play to a screenplay for a movie?  Not really, because when I did the play on stage, I actually did the movie on stage.  I played all 18 characters.  Wow.  And so it was very unique.  It was a very unique one-man show.  It was never really been done before.  Are you kidding me?  I did not know that.  You played all 18 characters?  All 18.  I did the movie on stage alone.  That's correct.  Yes.  How?  I know.  People always say that.  In fact, they just have a lot of different hats. 
[01:31:00]  No.  Taking one off, putting one on.  Now I'm a policeman.  No, no costumes, no hats, no nothing.  I mainly did it all with lights and just changing my dialect and changing my, you know, body language.  And it was just...  That would make me think it would be even more difficult to write the screenplay for it.  Well, you know, it's funny, because if you look at the play, if you read the play, then you read the screenplay.  It was pretty close.  Pretty close to exactly the same, you know.  I was able to do it because, you know, when Robert De Niro saw it, he loved the play so much. 
[01:31:30]  He wanted to stay true to it.  You know, we didn't deviate too much.  I mean, Robert De Niro, as a director, opened it up and put it outside, but he didn't want to deviate too much from that.  In fact, I'm going to be doing a piece of that.  I'm doing another one-man show.  I'm just starting a new one-man show that I did, and I'm going to be doing it to call my life in song.  And in that, I'm going to be doing a piece of the original play that I did on stage back then.  Is it true that I've heard rumors, because I mean, you must have been very psyched that De Niro decided to direct this. 
[01:32:00]  I heard that he had wanted to play, was your character's name Sonny in that?  Sonny, yeah.  Okay, he wanted to play Sonny.  That's not true at all.  Oh, it's not true.  He was happy playing the dead.  Not true at all.  The first conversation I ever had with him, he came over to me and said, you know, in fact, if you want to know exactly what he said, he came to me.  He said, look, he loved the play.  He was waiting for me backstage, and he said, look, I know what's going around Hollywood. 
[01:32:30]  I know everybody's been saying, you know, that they don't want you in it because you're not a star, but he ran through the whole thing.  He said, look, but the way I feel is that you should play Sonny, because you'd be great in it, and you should write the screenplay, because it's about your life.  And to be honest, I'll play Lorenzo, and I'll direct it, and if you shake my hand, that's the way it'll be.  And I shook his hand, and that's the way it was.  Now, that was kind of based on you growing up?  That was based on me growing up, yeah.  I saw this guy killing me when I was nine years old in front of my stoop, and my dad brought me upstairs, and that's how the whole thing, that's how it was a memory piece, and I started writing it from that one moment right there. 
[01:33:00]  There's something in that movie that was amazing to me how many people call this back, but if I'm out with a girl or whatever, and it's amazing, like I've leaned over and opened somebody's door for them,  and they've said, oh, you're one of the good ones, and they've referenced that moment where, in that movie, where if the girl opens the door for you, she's one of the good,  if she leans in the car, opens your driver's side door when you're walking around the car, she's a good girl.  It's amazing, because a lot of the lines in Bronx Tale have just seeped into the American culture. 
[01:33:30]  I mean, I get so many people that come over to me and tell me, they go, you know, here's my wife, I want you to meet her, you know, she opened the door for me, and I go, oh, wow, that's great.  And sometimes when I get on a plane, not all the time, but a lot of times when I get on a plane, I'm sitting there, and as soon as the door closes,  the pilot gets on and goes, now you can't leave, you know, and everybody laughs because they see me on the plane,  but it's like, it's an amazing thing, you know, throw him in the bathroom, it took 20 bucks, it cost you $20 to get rid of him. 
[01:34:00]  It's just a lot of the lines from that movie.  So what did your dad say to you when you saw this go down on your stoop when you were nine years old?  Well, he grabbed me upstairs, basically, he went, you know, with a tire.  He went right past that, to me, that's just amazing.  Yeah, he just grabbed me, brought me upstairs, and kind of like, you know, they just tried, once they saw I was okay,  I wasn't shot or injured or anything, they felt a lot better, and then the cops came up, knocked on the door, 
[01:34:30]  and in reality, I didn't go downstairs, but for the movie, I embellished it as any right it does.  You know, I brought myself downstairs, face sunny, but in reality, I never went downstairs, I said, no, I didn't see nothing, and then...  I didn't see nothing.  And I stayed upstairs, and that was it.  Did you have nightmares about that?  No, not...  Even when you were a kid, nothing?  Nothing.  Wow.  I don't know, people have said that to me, and I go, you know what, to be honest with you, I can't tell you that I had nightmares by,  and I think of my son now, who's 11, and I saw it when I was younger than him, and I can't imagine him watching that, 
[01:35:00]  and I would be, oh my God, devastated, but it just, I don't know, for whatever reason, it didn't affect me that way,  but obviously it did, because I wrote about it years later.  Right, right, right.  Were you close during that with Lilo Brancato?  Yes, I didn't know him very well, sure.  Yeah, and I know it's 13 years later or something that the film was made, but...  Yeah, you know, it's an amazing thing that you bring that up, and...  He's the guy that was involved with the cop shooting here in New York. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, and I'm glad he did, because he was a boy who was in the ultimate movie about not wasting your life.  Yeah.  You know, the epitome of not wasting your life, and he said the words that I wrote, you know,  the saddest thing in life is wasted talent, and the choices you make will shape your life forever.  And what does he do?  He makes the wrong choices.  Yeah.  You know, drugs, you know, you fool around with drugs, you know, drugs are 99-0, you know, you can't win.  You know, and anybody out there who thinks they can win, this is what happens. 
[01:36:00]  And I'm saddened by that, but I'm more saddened that we lost a great police officer, a hero.  So I'm mad at him, I'm upset with him, and you know what?  And I'm sorry, though, he gets what he deserves.  He made the wrong choices, he did that, and now he has to pay the crime, now he has to pay for his crime.  That's what happens.  That's exactly right.  As an actor, because I do a little acting, and as you've seen, very little, yeah, decimal point of acting.  What do you do when you're going into, like, a role? 
[01:36:30]  Like, do you actually decide, all right, how am I going to make this, like, Chaz, or, like, how do I kind of lose Chaz in this?  It's really hard for me, and I really shoved my face slap for attempting to talk acting with Chaz Palmitari,  but I don't like to give up my personality.  It's really hard to do that, to do a role.  Well, you don't have to.  What you have to do is make sure a piece of your personality.  You know, like, sometimes actors, people say actors put on masks.  I never felt that way.  I think actors take off masks.  I think you can't play something unless that part of you is somewhere inside of you. 
[01:37:00]  You know, so basically, you cannot hide you, because that is you, but you take, you get the role, and you take the best of what you have,  and you take that big character, and you try to mold both of them together.  Is it hard for you when you're acting?  This is what I always run into trouble with, and I ask every great actor this.  My hands, I never know what to do with my hands when I act.  I don't know, like, I move them very stiffly.  I'm very conscious of them hanging there.  Well, that's because you worry about your hands too much. 
[01:37:30]  Stop worrying about them.  It'll be fine.  You're not worried about your hands right now while you're talking to me, are you?  No, I'll tell you, I'm sitting now with my right leg up on the console, and my hands are kind of folded very comfortably in front of me.  There you go, okay.  But if he had to play this part right here that he's doing in real life in a movie, he'd be all stiff.  Well, yeah, but that's the art of acting.  The art of acting is to act and not to show people you're acting.  See, he's laughing.  It's like, it's so simple, you idiot.  That's the problem.  Not only do I show them I'm acting, I show up with an I'm acting shirt. 
[01:38:00]  It's just, you know what, acting is the hardest, easiest thing you'll ever try.  It's a very difficult thing, but people think it's easy, but it's not.  But did you ever do a role that you look back on and you're like, that was absolutely the hardest thing I'm ever going to do in this business?  Well, the hardest, I think the play was the hardest thing I ever did.  The actual play of Bronx Teal was the hardest.  And it's the most rewarding thing I've ever did.  I mean, an hour and 40 minutes alone on stage doing a movie by yourself, that was the hardest. 
[01:38:30]  Sounds psychotic to even attempt that.  It was absolutely insane.  I mean, now, just now, because I had to rehearse, do a piece of it in my new show, I just did five minutes of it.  It was like, oh, my God, please.  Yeah, what was I?  Thank you.  How many different characters?  I was in a zone, you know.  Yeah.  It was in one of those zones, you know, either make it or die, one of those zones.  You know, but there was a few roles that were very difficult.  I thought Hurley Burley was a tough role because, only because I took a lot of it home and it was a very depressing role.  I must say, I think Hoodwink was very tough for you there. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, that was fun.  Come on.  Animated.  The animation movies are fun.  And I do those because my kids can watch them.  Yeah.  My kids have really never seen a movie that I've done, except Bronx Teal.  I had my oldest son watch Bronx Teal.  That's pretty cool.  Hurley Burley, that's a very famous play.  I think I read part of that or attempted it in a monologue and then gave up immediately.  I don't think I tried to memorize it.  What was the character's name you played in that?  I played Phil in that.  It was a very, very, a lot of heavy dialogue. 
[01:39:30]  A lot.  It was, you know, it was David.  It was Mammoth and it was kind of like street Shakespeare.  Very difficult to memorize and very difficult to act.  But I remember that.  I'm very proud of my work in that.  But I remember it was a very heavy load on my head when I did that movie.  How was Sean Penn to work with?  Difficult.  Nice guy.  Sean was great.  Yeah.  Not only an incredible actor, just extremely generous and bright.  And it's like having another director on the set.  Very bright.  Yeah.  I didn't realize.  It's funny.  I'm looking back over there. 
[01:40:00]  Give us a bio.  And you did an episode of Hill Street Blues in 1986.  That's correct, yes.  That was the first thing I got when I got to L.A.  I auditioned.  And I think it was the first thing I auditioned for.  And I got an episode of Hill Street Blues.  Wow.  What were you doing before?  Writing, obviously?  No, I was acting in New York and doing off-roadway plays.  Off-roadway.  Doing showcases and off-roadway plays.  And decided to just go out to L.A. and do some auditions?  And I decided because, you know, I said, look, I wasn't giving up.  And I was working as a doorman in New York, supplementing my income at that time. 
[01:40:30]  And then finally I just said, look, I'm going out to L.A., try Hollywood.  And I went out there and then Hill Street Blues and a few other things.  And then finally I ran out of money again.  Then I got a job as a doorman again there.  And I got fired from that job because I didn't let this big agent in.  And then one night I just got very depressed and disgusted with my life that night when I got fired.  I realized I didn't have much money in the bank. 
[01:41:00]  I had about 200-something dollars there.  And I said, what the hell am I going to do with my life?  I thought about going back to New York.  And then I said, nope.  I said, if they won't give me a part, I'm going to write one myself.  I'll write a great part myself.  I got in my car.  I drove to Trifty Drugstore.  I got five tabs of yellow legal-sized paper.  And I sat down.  And I said, what the hell am I going to write about?  And I wrote that five-minute monologue.  And I remember this killing that I saw when I was a kid.  And I wrote that.  I did it for my theater workshop.  And then I wrote each day. 
[01:41:30]  I would write five, six hours a day.  And then I would do it, perform it every Monday at my theater.  And at the end of ten months, I had an hour-and-a-half show.  Wow.  And that's how Bronx Tale.  I decided to just change my life, and I did it.  That's awesome.  We got Shane from the Bronx.  Sorry.  That has something for Chaz.  Shane.  Hey, Chaz.  Listen, I'm a cop in the city, and an officer in Chaltegi was in my company.  And I just wanted to say thank you for the kind words that you say, because going out  to the guys in the 4-0 and company 2-21, it means a lot to us knowing that where you stand 
[01:42:00]  in the issue.  Well, thank you for that.  You're very welcome.  God bless you all.  Thank you.  Maybe now some of us can start watching a Bronx Tale again, because after December  10th, I couldn't watch it.  Oh, I'm sorry.  It's hard for me to hear you on that one.  I missed that one.  You said that he's, now, after hearing you say that a lot of the guys can watch a Bronx  Tale again, because after that day, it was kind of hard for a lot of them to watch it  because of, you know, the young guy that was in it.  Yeah, you know, and I feel bad by that. 
[01:42:30]  But I understand, you know.  I totally understand.  And that's why when people say, do you feel bad for the kid?  And I say, no, you know, the kid had every chance in the world, and he screwed up, you  know.  God gave him the opportunity, and we should not talk.  And I always say, we shouldn't talk about him.  We should talk about the hero cop who died.  You know, it's not about him anymore.  You know, he's away, and that's it.  The guy who risked his life, because thank God for people like that detective who risked  his life for people like us to have a free world.  So I think that's important.  Hey, Che, you said you got fired for not letting a big agent into as a doorman. 
[01:43:00]  Yes.  Did you ever see that big agent again?  Well, he passed away.  Oh, okay.  Did he ever see you get famous?  You know what?  He passed away just when I was about to bust out.  Damn him.  He was Swiftie Lazar.  He was like the biggest agent in Hollywood.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Swiftie Lazar?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Lizard, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was a biggie.  Hey, let's talk about the new movie, A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints.  Yes.  Yeah, really, this was a film that I really, when I read the script, I said I had to do it. 
[01:43:30]  In fact, I was producing a movie at the time, and there was no way I was able to do this.  But then when I read the script, I just pushed the movie that I was producing back, and I was starring it, and I'm producing it.  I pushed it back.  I actually had to pay for a week myself because the locations were already set, but I didn't care.  That's how much I loved the script, and I did it, and this is with Robert Downey Jr. and Rosario Dawson and Diane Weiss and Channing Tatum and Shia Laveau. 
[01:44:00]  And it was just a great script about this man who, a father who loved his son so much but really couldn't, didn't know how to express it.  One of the scripts written by Ditto Montel, it was really his life, a lot of his life story in it, and I played his father.  And he, a young writer-director who just has a vision of his own and a concept that just breaks ground, you know, and I just, I just believed in the kid, and I just knew he'd make a great movie.  You're getting really great reviews.  Like, we, one of the quotes about it is, Palminteri Burst with mule-headed rage. 
[01:44:30]  He is ferocious, and he has a ferocious, incredible malevolence.  I don't know what that means, but I would love someone to say that about me.  I don't either.  Sounds good.  You know, I never read reviews, especially the good ones.  I don't read those at all.  Really?  You're that disciplined?  Yes.  Because I think we all have it in us to wonder what other people are saying.  No message boards or anything, huh?  No, no.  I don't read reviews.  I mean, if people tell me, hey, the movie got great reviews, I go, oh, that's great.  You know, I mean, I'm happy to hear that. 
[01:45:00]  Don't get me wrong.  But as far as me reading them myself, no.  I never read them.  What taught you not to read them?  Did you start off and then read one thing that just made your stomach turn and go, no more?  Well, I read, the last reviews I read were Bronx Tale reviews, and they were just off the charts, and they were so great.  And it did something to me, and I said, you know what, this is not good.  And it just made me, you know, I said, this is crazy.  You know, I don't want to believe that stuff.  You know, I'd rather just focus on the work, and if they love it, great. 
[01:45:30]  If they hate it, great.  Because you can't control things like that.  People, some people are not going to like it, and some people are going to like it.  And so, you know, you cannot control that, you know.  So the main thing is, from the books I read about spirituality, and it's just put all that stuff away.  And I put blinders on, and I just do my work.  And at the end of my lifetime, whatever I have, let the world judge that.  I can't judge it.  And you're just hoping for a good average, you know.  That's exactly right.  You're exactly right.  But, you know, out of maybe 80 movies that I do at the end of my lifetime, maybe God Bless, 5 will be great. 
[01:46:00]  Maybe 10 will be good.  And maybe some will be, hey, that's not bad.  And maybe some will suck, you know.  But that's okay.  But I can't worry about that now.  You know, a lot of people are bringing up pool hall junkies today on the phones.  Actually, let's, Matty, talk to Chaz for a second here.  Matty in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  And I was just going in to say how much I love pool hall junkies. 
[01:46:30]  Chaz, you and Christopher Walken and that were just excellent.  I wonder if you had any interesting anecdotes about working on that.  It's hard for me to hear.  I don't know why I've got a bad connection.  But I know he said that he loved pool hall junkies, so I want to thank him.  He wanted to know if you had anything.  He said he loved it with you and Walken.  Was there anything interesting that happened on the film that people might not know about?  Oh, anything?  Well, Chris Walken is just, I mean, he is just a fabulous actor.  I mean, Chris Walken can read the phone book and it's funny. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  I mean, come on.  I mean, this guy is interesting.  You just want to watch him.  And he was, you know, I was a big fan of his.  So when I had the opportunity to work with him, it was just great.  No, there was really nothing.  He's a real professional.  He gets there and we did our thing.  There really was nothing that I could say that anything that came on Ordinary, no.  Did anybody ever intimidate you in a scene?  Like, because, you know, you would love their work so much and you finally got to work with  them and you found yourself being just more nervous than you probably should have been?  You know what? 
[01:47:30]  That's a good question.  And I worked with Robert De Niro and I was on stage with Al Pacino.  I did a play with Alan.  And I worked with a lot of great actors and Nicholson, all of them.  But the only person who didn't intimidate me, but the only person who I could never get  over who he was, every time I was with him, I would, after maybe 20 minutes, I would turn  around to myself and go, Jesus, God, I can't believe this.  And that was Frank Sinatra.  Wow.  Well, yeah, that's a biggie.  Okay.  We'll give you that one.  He was the only one who I just, when I was in his company, when I was at the dinner with 
[01:48:00]  him, when I was at his house.  You're at his house.  Oh, yeah, you know, and I was at his house and I, you know, I just could not get over  it.  It was him.  He was the only one.  I couldn't, I don't know what it was.  I just couldn't do it.  What do you remember about his house?  What do I remember about Frank?  Anything that stands out like, I can't believe Frank Sinatra has this in his house or.  You know, I got to know him through De Niro and.  Oh, of course.  Same way I did.  Yeah, we understand that.  Yeah.  Look at us bonding. 
[01:48:30]  And I'll tell you a great story.  I, and people always go, you know, Charles, when did you know you really kind of made  it?  I go, they go, was it the Academy Award nomination?  I go, no, no, it really wasn't.  I go, I was at a barbecue.  And they go, what?  I go, no, no, no.  I was at a barbecue with Sinatra's house.  And there was a whole bunch of people there.  And all of a sudden, everybody kind of walked back inside.  And it was just Frank and I outside.  And I've been along with him, you know, quite often.  But this was one time I got a little emotional for some reason.  I don't know why. 
[01:49:00]  I was sitting out there looking at the, he was in Malibu.  And I turned to him and I said, you know, Frank, I said, you don't have, you don't realize  the imprint that you left on the American, the world culture and your music.  I said, my mom and dad, my, the families, the people, just, they adore you.  And even my generation, even the new generation adores you.  And he was like, oh, Charles, come on, stop, stop, stop.  You know, he kind of fluffed it off, you know.  And then he turns to me and he says, you know, I really love The Bronx Tale.  I thought it was a great movie.  I said, oh, thank you.  He goes, and I could tell you why it was great. 
[01:49:30]  And I said, wow, Frank Snyder's going to tell me why.  My movie's great.  Why, Frank?  And he says, because I didn't fall asleep.  Actually, he said, because I didn't effing fall asleep.  But I will say that on the radio.  That's great.  You wanted some profound, like, words about the movie.  That's great, man.  So then he tells me, he says, so then quickly, I'll tell you the end of the story.  He tells me, he goes, you don't drink.  The guy says, no, I don't.  He says, me, I like gin martinis.  And he downs his gin martini in front of me.  And then he takes out, he takes out, there's two olives on the toothpick. 
[01:50:00]  And he goes, come on, share my olive.  And I said, why don't you share my olive?  And I went.  So I just took the olive off.  He goes, you ready?  I go, yeah.  And we pop the olives in our mouth.  And he puts his arm around me.  He goes, I really like you, kid.  You come to me.  You come to me.  Call me anytime.  And we walk inside.  And as we walk inside, I was telling everybody the story, what just happened with the olives.  And Gregory Peck overheard me.  And Gregory Peck, the actor, the great actor, Gregory Peck, said to me, he goes, Frank, share  an olive with you? 
[01:50:30]  And I said, yeah.  He goes, you should be very flat.  He goes, that was a Rat Pack tradition.  They would share their olives with each other.  Oh, wow.  And that's.  Man, yeah.  That was a great.  I said, OK, I think I got something.  Yeah, that's one of those moments.  We have probably relieved at that moment, too, that it was just a Rat Pack moment, not something  else.  I'm really excited about my movie, The Guide to Recognizing Your Saints.  And it's a terrific film.  And it's really, you know, and when you say the title, Guide to Recognizing Your Saints,  and just like Bronx Tale was kind of my story, this is kind of Ditto Montel's story, you 
[01:51:00]  see.  So when you say it's a guide to recognizing your saints, it's the people you meet in your  life, whether they're good or bad, and how they steer you in a certain direction on your  path to life.  So it's a terrific movie.  And it opens today nationwide.  Getting great reviews.  Amazing reviews.  Yeah, it got amazing reviews.  I hear the Times and the L.A. Times, New York Times, and they're all telling me that.  Yeah, but you're only hearing this, right?  Yes, I have not read one of those.  People are saying.  But it's a wonderful cast of characters, and it's something that I think young people 
[01:51:30]  should see.  Just like Bronx Tale was a thing where people, it affected them.  I think guides will do the same thing to you.  And the last thing is, Dov Davidoff is a very good friend of mine, and I have to tell  you how jealous and nauseous your friendship with him makes me, and my goal is to spoil that  friendship.  Well, let me tell you, Dov Davidoff is one of the funniest, funniest comics I've ever seen  on stage, and also a really terrific actor.  Yeah, he is a good actor. 
[01:52:00]  He's got good reviews in that Mark Wahlberg movie.  It really bugged me.  He's a terrific actor, and he's just fabulous in that new movie, Invincible.  Thanks a lot, Chaz, for calling.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  There he goes.  That's very, very cool.  It's out Friday-wide.  There you go.  Thank you, Roland.  All right.  Yeah, I watched Dov.  Dov was comfortable acting with him.  It was really...  Really?  Yeah, really impressive, man.  Dov is really funny.  Dov is a good actor.  It bugs me.  Real funny comics.  We've got to get him on the show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He would love to.  His girlfriend's a huge fan.  He's a fan.  Definitely come on, man. 
[01:52:30]  And she's a boxer or something?  Is she a boxer?  Yeah.  We were hanging out with them at the cellar one night, and she's just a kickboxer or something.  She's like the real deal.  She'd kick your ass.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  When we get back, we'll do a speed round before we get out of here.  Right.  The Opie and Anthony Fatty Pig Fatty Contest began like a stampede of hungry rhinos, but now  it more closely resembles a sleepy, winded elephant.  The current heavyweight in the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest is Crystal from Cleveland, who weighed 
[01:53:00]  in at 430 pounds.  We're so sure there's someone bigger out there, we put up a fatty finder's fee in the amount  of $1,000 to the person who brings in the heaviest girl by the end of the contest.  So grab your sonar equipment and find us a whale.  Remember, the heaviest girl at the end of the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest gets $10 for every  floorboard-shattering, tear-inducing, self-esteem-destroying pound on her body.  That bottom girl, you make the rockin' world go round. 
[01:53:30]  Go to opieandanthony.com for contest details.  Almost out of here.  And then we'll head over to XM Satellite Radio.  We're almost out of here for part one.  Part one, that's right.  Yeah, we're only half over.  Then there's part two here.  Just a reminder, my brother put together a thing for F.H. Riley's this weekend, last  past standing.  A bunch of the listeners are going to try to be funny on stage at my brother's restaurant. 
[01:54:00]  It's my restaurant, too, but I'm a silent partner.  I don't do crap for the place.  You're the loudest silent partner ever.  I know, we promote.  I'm sorry about that.  Now, my brother works his ass off like 70, 80 hours a week.  It's a great, great place, and a lot of the listeners will be there Friday, sorry, tomorrow  night, tomorrow night, Saturday night, F.H. Riley's 400 New York Avenue in Huntington  Village.  I'll be there after the Islanders game, and my brother's going to be emceeing. 
[01:54:30]  He's never done that before, so it should be interesting.  Oh, yeah.  We should get some good audio out of it.  It might stop by.  I don't know.  You were hinting at it the other day.  I'm doing something earlier in the evening.  You might end your night there, right?  I don't know.  Yeah.  I think I might end up over there.  We'll see.  I'll definitely be there, though, and it should be a good time.  Parking spot in the back?  Yeah, no problem.  Might be bringing the hot rod out.  Yeah?  Maybe.  That would be cool.  Maybe.  That would be very, very cool.  All right.  Can you take some listeners for a spin? 
[01:55:00]  No.  Why not?  You should, like, charge the ride.  You think I want listeners in there?  Yeah, eating a fluff and a sandwich.  This is great, man.  Eating chicken wings in the passenger seat.  Pat from Unaki.  Puking up eggnog.  What would make you happier, and I mean, on a scale of anything in the world, than somebody  vomiting onto his, like, driver's side door handle?  Oh, my God.  That's just...  He would throw the car away.  Throw the car away.  I'd have to throw the car away.  You'd have to have a new door put on, wouldn't you?  Yeah.  Oh, easily.  Yeah.  You wouldn't just wash it off? 
[01:55:30]  No.  It couldn't wash off.  How does that wash off?  Vomit.  It doesn't.  Especially because it would go between the window where the window...  Yeah, at some point, it would still be somewhere.  There was about, God, seven years ago or so, when I first got together with my girlfriend,  her mom decided to take the dog to the vet.  Ugh.  And it had to go into the back of my SUV because I was being, like, a nice guy and everything.  Oh, my God.  And there was a bowl of dog food back there. 
[01:56:00]  And the dog food went all over the place.  And I swear, when I traded in the vehicle...  You were still finding dog food, right?  The day I brought it in...  Yeah.  Dog food.  Like, I'd step on the brake too hard, and dog food would come out from the back seat from  everywhere.  I was like, oh, God, got to get rid of this.  Speaking of dogs...  Oh, wow.  Thank you, Anthony.  What a segue.  Well, you did it.  What a segue.  You led us in this direction.  We got to do a speed round.  There's too much going on.  Nip Tuck. 
[01:56:30]  Danny brought this to our attention.  Peanut butter treats on Nip Tuck.  They got away with this on TV the other night.  They took that gag and got away with it.  Yeah, they did a little thing on it.  Wife is met by husband at plastic surgery office.  Husband confronts wife over finding an open peanut butter jar by the bed.  All right.  Let me think.  What could it be?  She's snacking?  Midnight snack.  Midnight snack? 
[01:57:00]  Crackers.  Peanut butter.  Peanut butter.  Peanut butter.  Peanut butter.  Jelly.  You could tell, though, if there's knife marks in it.  Or cloth.  Or just two fingers.  Like, it looks like the same kind of top like a Vaseline jar.  You're not using a knife to take Vaseline out.  Well, this is how it went down on Nip Tuck.  Literally.  Where will I get my sensation back?  Should come back over the next few months.  Mark. 
[01:57:30]  Hello, Sherry.  What are you?  I thought.  You thought what?  Excuse me, but we're in the middle of an exam.  You'll have to take a seat in the waiting room.  Well, you said you weren't coming back until the 30th.  So you booked a little plastic surgery to make yourself look all pretty for me?  How'd you know?  You went home.  I called your sister.  I'm sorry.  I didn't clean the house.  Guess what I saw?  Sir, the homecoming's going to have to wait until your wife is discharged. 
[01:58:00]  Did Rojo poop inside?  I asked my sister to walk him.  I saw an open peanut butter jar by the goddamn bed, Sherry.  First of all, I got to stop the clip.  This is the worst acting ever.  The acting is horrific.  Well, two questions.  What kind of...  Was she having surgery that had anything to do with the peanut butter jar incident?  No, no.  Okay.  Probably new boobies or something, right?  So why didn't you just say she was eating celery in bed unless they had a problem before? 
[01:58:30]  It's going to be explained, Danny.  Oh, okay.  I thought we agreed this wasn't going to happen again.  I told you I didn't clean up.  I didn't know that you were coming back.  So now you just keep it there by the bed in case the spirit moves you.  How often?  Every night?  Sergeant, if your wife's peanut butter addiction is a problem, you'll have to deal with this at home. 
[01:59:00]  I'll be done in 60 seconds.  It's really bad acting.  It really is, yeah.  I don't know if it loses something with just the audio.  Yeah.  That's pretty rough.  He dramatically found a jar of peanut butter near the bed.  Sounds like Clint Eastwood and American Psycho Dude.  I thought we agreed this wasn't going to happen again.  Jar of peanut butter.  Yeah. 
[01:59:30]  Go ahead.  Make my sandwich.  Should I give away the clip coming up?  No.  Let's hear it.  Just hear it?  Okay.  I'm excited.  All right.  This is what ends up happening.  Oh.  You know, on our very first date, Jerry.  Oh, the girl in scene is Laura Ingalls.  Thank you, John of Connecticut.  Really?  Laura Ingalls.  Really?  Loves to take a couple fingers of peanut butter.  Laura Ingalls. 
[02:00:00]  She'd take a half pint.  You know, I remember Nick.  Nick, your name was Evan.  Thank you, Eddie.  Very fresh, Eddie, Jerry.  As you sat there, chattering away, my mind ran through all the things about you.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  There's a lot of things going on.  Unfortunately, we didn't see this episode.  Dave did in Atlanta.  Dave.  Dave.  I want this to make the radio, so kind of, you know, kind of skirt a little bit.  I watched him not do this right.  Do a little dancing around the ring.  I watched him not do this right. 
[02:00:30]  Let's see if you guys have learned anything from this show.  Dance for us, Dave.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, the reason she's at the plastic surgery is because she's missing a part of her breast.  That's the part.  And the dog took it out?  Yes.  Oh, very good.  Okay.  The whole circle area.  Okay.  All right.  Now he's going to ruin it, though.  He almost ruined it?  Did he ruin it?  He might have.  He might have ruined it.  Wait.  Did the dog take it out while the husband was away?  I believe it got a little crazy in the bedroom. 
[02:01:00]  So she needed some plastic surgery done.  Real quick.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She was trying to fix herself back up before he got home, I guess.  Yeah.  I believe she was just getting regular plastic surgery.  Her dog must have been in a frenzy over something.  Maybe he just loves peanut butter.  That must have been it.  And he was in a frenzy.  And she's feeding him the peanut butter.  Yeah.  And I don't know.  It'd be funny if it was a poodle.  Back to the clip.  All right. 
[02:01:30]  Now we got the back story.  Here we go.  Now we know why she's in the plastic surgeon's office.  You know, on our very first day, Cherry, as you sat there chattering away,  my mind ran through all the things about you that could become a problem for me.  As you know, I like to anticipate.  You know what you failed to anticipate, Mark?  How lonely I would get with you gone for months at a time. 
[02:02:00]  And I also failed to anticipate that you would turn into a faithless, demented whore  who would use peanut butter to seduce your own dog.  Fantastic.  Fantastic.  Wow.  Oh, we got a winner.  How did they get through that script without just laughing?  Come on. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, that is great.  With your own dog.  Dog.  Coming attractions for a guide to recognizing your own saints or whatever it just showed.  That movie looks fantastic.  Yeah.  That's a great clip.  Ooh.  The overacting.  Fail to anticipate.  That you would turn into a faithless, demented whore  who would use peanut butter to seduce your own dog. 
[02:03:00]  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  What's in your duffel bag, Mark?  What did you do?  What was I supposed to do?  Uh-oh.  What any man would do to us.  Wife's lover.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Wait a minute.  Please tell me.  Boy, are they going for broke on this show. 
[02:03:30]  This is a show, by the way, that's critically acclaimed, right?  It was the first season.  Yeah.  I don't think so much anymore.  It's lost a little bit.  It's lost.  I watched it the first season and it was really good.  And then I noticed at the beginning of the second season, it really started getting silly.  Campy.  Like really weird and just like, why don't you just stick to the basics?  There are two plastic surgeons with the women coming in.  They're having sex with the women and they're trying to fix them up.  You know, that's pretty much was the basic plot line and their personal lives with kind of a cool story. 
[02:04:00]  But then it just got silly where they brought in some serial killer storyline.  And then that got like a ridiculous soap opera thing where the storylines just get crazy.  And this one's, I mean, fantastic.  I wish I did watch this one.  Yeah, the duffel bag scene.  Is that what we think it is?  Yeah, basically at that point, that's when he unzips this duffel bag and proceeds to dump out the dead dog's body.  How big of a dog is it though? 
[02:04:30]  Well, they only showed it for a few seconds, but it looked to be a fairly, like a medium-sized dog.  Yeah.  A fairly large dog.  Like a lab.  Yeah, you know, like a medium-sized.  Something like that.  And they didn't show you from the front really, so it was kind of hard to tell what kind of dog it was.  It wasn't a dachshund, was it?  No, it was a decent-sized dog.  That was probably the most upsetting part to a lot of people, the dead dog thing.  We're going to go to Chris in Jersey.  Get ready on the dump, Al.  This is one for the XMers.  Go ahead, Chris.  It wasn't a poodle, Jimmy. 
[02:05:00]  It was a, and you can't really say it, but it wasn't a pit bull either.  Oh, you want to keep it clean.  All right, we were going to let you just go all out, but all right, we'll keep it right there.  I hope he lined you up on the runway for that one.  I helped you out.  All right, he went with that.  Rhymes with it.  He decided to wave it off.  Hey, Football Picks, sponsored by Dish Network.  More football for you.  Better TV for all.  Call 1-888-GET-DISH.  We're doing this every week.  At the end of the season, someone's going to win $10,000.  We're talking about the staff. 
[02:05:30]  Sorry, guys.  Talking about the staff that works for the Opie and Anthony Show.  And I'm in there as the goof factor.  And if I win, I take my $10,000 and I throw it out from a helicopter over some city.  Not Manhattan.  Yeah, they're not going to let me do it over Manhattan.  Thinking Pittsburgh, maybe Buffalo.  I don't know.  We're going to figure this out.  Yeah.  I still got to win.  I'm in second place right now.  So got to do the football picks.  How are we doing it?  Just picking it out of a hat?  Yep.  Exciting.  All right.  I'm just picking them out of a hat this week. 
[02:06:00]  And a fan's dirty, nervous hat.  Well, stupid Patrice O'Neal helped me out last week.  One for five.  Patrice doesn't know football.  One for five.  He matches jerseys and hats.  He's a girl.  My first.  Oh, come on.  But I am going to the game.  So, all right.  I really think the Dolphins are going to upset the Jets at home this week.  But I just picked the Jets.  So I got Jets this week.  You're sticking with the Jets.  Jets are killing me every week.  Next game out of a hat here.  Falcons at home over the Giants.  Two home games so far. 
[02:06:30]  Two for two.  I like that.  All right.  Third game.  Look how exciting this is.  It's unbelievable.  No, but the hat's coming in.  We got the hand.  You never know what he's going to pick, this kid.  Sorry, Detroit.  But you got the great baseball team.  I'm going Bills over the Lions this week.  How about with the points?  Just straight up.  But what about the spread with the guy?  The points.  They're Fez.  Fez.  Fez.  I want my Obey Fez shirt immediately.  Next game.  That's a wacky shirt.  Got the Eagles.  Just pulling these out of the hat this week. 
[02:07:00]  Eagles over the Saints.  Eagles.  Finally.  Last game.  Come on, Pittsburgh.  Come on, Pittsburgh.  Yes.  All right.  We got the Steelers at home over the Chiefs.  There's this week's picks.  Very exciting, I know.  Wow.  Football picks sponsored by Dish Network.  More football for you.  Better TV for all.  Call 1-888-GET-DISH.  You know, you've never asked me to make your picks.  Next week.  How's that?  How's that?  Next week.  Okay.  I'll do a little research.  I'll help you out.  I didn't know if you want to be involved.  I'm not involved.  It'd take two seconds. 
[02:07:30]  I'd just go, ah, that team.  This team.  That team.  All right.  Because I don't know squat about them.  Well, that's what we're kind of trying to prove.  Yeah.  That anyone can pick these games.  Right.  I'm still in it, and I've only tried to pick them seriously one week, and that week I sucked.  Yeah.  I think it was like two for five trying.  What happens?  Hey, we have time to play a little Mel Gibson audio before we get out of here?  Please.  Watch him groveling in front of that stupid Diane Sawyer with a different camera lens.  Oh, that apologizing idiot.  They had Diane Sawyer's different camera lens.  Awful.  It was like watching two movies spliced together. 
[02:08:00]  You're old.  Accept it.  You're not a young woman.  You're not sexy.  You're an old bag of meat.  Every year, the Vaseline gets thicker and thicker on that lens.  It's like watching someone do a dream segment.  That's really good, Jim.  Cuba, right?  I just hate her.  Yes, Guantanamo Bay.  Gitmo.  That's one gig you really can't promote.  You can't handle the truth.  You really can't promote that gig.  I'll get them all laughing with that monologue.  Mel was drinking tequila but doesn't know how much. 
[02:08:30]  A few drinks later, and I was in the back of a police car wailing.  A few drinks later, do you know how many?  No, I don't.  But I know the tequila.  Everything was fuzzy like your face in that monitor.  A couple of months.  Years go by.  You're fine.  And then all of a sudden, in a heartbeat, in an instant, on an impulse,  somebody shoves a glass of mezcal in front of your nose and says,  it's from Oaxaca.  And you go, wah.  And it's burning its way through your esophagus.  And you go, oh, man, what did I do that for?  Can't put the toothpaste back in the tube. 
[02:09:00]  Were you drinking from the open bottle of tequila in the car?  Step on it and let all the toothpaste out.  Absolutely.  And then rub it all over juice.  You can finish brushing your teeth.  No need to go over to Mr. Saperstein's house and rub toothpaste in his eyes and burn them.  Juice paste.  This guy is capable of killing someone.  Yeah, he's certifiably insane, I believe.  Mel doesn't know what he'd say if the officer had been black.  Oh, boy.  At least he's being honest. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, no.  If the police officer had been black.  Mm-hmm.  Black.  Mm-hmm.  Maybe.  I don't know.  What would you have said?  Who knows?  I'd have to get loaded again and tell you and then be in those conditions.  Could you please?  Because it's unpredictable what's going to come flying out.  That would be a great new reality show.  Get him loaded and get him in a car.  One week, it's a black guy.  Next week, it's an Asian guy.  Next week, it's a woman, a gay guy. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  Just go through the circuit.  Where are we going tonight, officer?  Oh, yeah?  It's your kind.  That screws everything up for us normal white people.  You ****.  That's a tool beep.  I hated lethal weapons.  They team me up with a ****. 
[02:10:30]  He doesn't know what he would have said.  Here, he talks about his anger.  I've heard people say, you know, I am a angry ****.  So in the blank, I am a ****.  I'd be drunk until I snap for no reason and just turn.  Where does this anger come from?  I have no idea.  I've been angry all my life.  And I try not to have it manifest itself, you know? 
[02:11:00]  You try and keep a lock on it.  And it really isn't, it's real back there someplace.  Listen how calm he is.  I've talked to people about that.  Where is it coming from?  I can get really mad about, I can murder inanimate objects.  Oh.  Like, **** choking the toaster in the morning.  Yeah.  You know?  That's trying to be charming.  I'm going to go work in progress right now.  Shut up, Mel.  Just accept what you did.  Stop trying to charge.  You can murder the toaster. 
[02:11:30]  Ha-ha.  Me too.  Ha-ha.  Shut your face.  And stop groveling before this, this cryptic, cryptic woman.  This cadaver with a news show.  Whatever she is.  Whatever she is.  She doesn't even have a gender anymore.  She's so ancient.  It's just one big glop of meat.  Her whole body, from the neck to the ankles, is just sexless meat.  Speaking of old news broads, I saw Leslie Stahl yesterday.  Yeah.  Wow.  Bad?  Wow.  TV could cover up a world of hurt. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, you saw it live out there in the street?  Wow.  Walking corpse.  We saw Sting yesterday walking home.  He opened up his brother.  Saw Sting and his wife.  And Judy.  Did you say hi?  Hey, I saw you the other day.  No, no.  Blah, blah, blah.  I went, hey, Sting.  And he went, hey.  Hey.  Hello.  We kept walking.  And I go, remember?  We all talked about it.  Yeah.  Well, now we got two more clips.  But we got to go now.  Oh, but I want to hear Mel.  But I want to hear Mel, Opie.  How about on XM?  Because he's all quiet.  We'll continue on XM with the Mel clips.  That's right.  And we have two more hours of funny show to do. 
[02:12:30]  That's right.  Once again, no fatty showed up today for the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest.  Come on.  We only have, I think, two weeks left in the contest, right?  Where the hell are you?  Actually, we had one at XM earlier this week.  And she fell short.  She came in at 370 pounds.  The current leader is 430 pounds.  It's Crystal.  She's from Cleveland.  $10 a pound is what H57.com is paying for the eventual winner of the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest.  And they're also throwing in a $1,000 finder's fee for the person that brings in the winner of the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest, okay? 
[02:13:00]  Hopefully, we'll have better luck next week.  Fatty Pig Fatty brought to you by H57.  Who do you lose weight for free at H57.com?  If you're not joining us over at XM, have a great, great weekend.  And hopefully, we'll see a lot of people at FH Riley's tomorrow night for Last Pest Standing,  my brother's place, 400 New York Avenue in Huntington Village.  Boy.  See you Tuesday, boys. 
[02:13:30]  While you're off gallivanting having fun, I'll be on that wall.  Gallivanting?  Have fun in Cuba.  On the wall.  Right.  Bye.  We'll get some stories Tuesday.  Gitmo.  Gitmo.  Gitmo.  Gitmo.  Gitmo.  Gitmo.  Gitmo.  Gitmo.  Gitmo.  Gitmo.  Gitmo.  Gitmo.  Gitmo.  Gitmo.  Gitmo.  Gitmo.  Gitmo.  Gitmo.  I can walk on my hands.  I can fart and chew gum. 
[02:14:00]  I play the over.  I can ride a unicycle.  I wear a bra and laced panties.  So your talent is being queer, Travis?  It's the Opie and Anthony Walkover Talent Show.  If you have a unique skill, talent, music group, or physical affliction, we want to exploit.  You can email steve at foundrymusic.com with your ideas, or you can just show up during the  walk to XM and start shuckin' and jivin'.  Shuckin' and jivin'?  Jesus, Danny.  I don't write this sh**.  The Opie and Anthony XM Walkover begins now.  Oh, apparently we're on the air. 
[02:14:30]  That's cold, huh?  Apparently.  Let's get walking immediately.  Yeah.  I'm not talking to anybody.  I'm not taking any goddamn pictures.  Matt!  Beltrod!  430 feet, baby!  What?  Sorry.  I'm just walking, because it's cold.  It's cold today, sir. 
[02:15:00]  Yankees!  Bruh!  Yankees, come on!  Come on, you're killing us!  Help out our Mets, man!  No, you keep the faith, my brother!  Come on, help us out, bro!  Next year, bro!  Next year!  Come on!  Leave that Yankee jacket at home!  Yeah.  Well, if he had a home, Opie, he might.  Good point, good point.  Oh, what?  Huh?  What are they saying?  Oh?  It's too...  I can't believe it's cold already. 
[02:15:30]  I'm just wearing a little foot jacket.  Where are you, you little waist-like Jimmy?  Oh, you're way...  But there he is.  Look how chilly he looks.  Cold boy coming through!  Come on, chilly lad!  Oh, it's good, sir.  You little frozen fella.  I really am.  Don't bitch about the cold today.  This guy's in shorts.  I hope he's catching pneumonia.  You're gonna catch your death.  Who's in shorts?  Why shorts? 
[02:16:00]  Show off.  Mets!  I'm with you, bro.  Me and you.  Oh, why don't you walk with him, then?  You're with him.  You should be living in a boxcar.  Did you see that guy?  He's awful.  Nice ass, sir.  Well, thanks.  That's good.  Oh.  Oh, hey.  He covered it.  No, but one of these days, I'm gonna luck out.  You'll see.  No, dude, he covered it.  Somebody's taking pictures.  Who?  Who are you?  I don't know.  No pictures.  No pictures.  We're famous. 
[02:16:30]  They're famous.  I'm kind of known.  He's a madman.  Oh, the sun.  Oh, for a second, it was warm.  Yeah.  It won't be for long.  No.  Warm.  Back into the cold.  Watch.  Right here.  Cold.  Trading in your iced coffees for...  Lattes.  For the lattes now.  Oh, hello.  Oh, that's like a camouflage bag.  That's it.  That's camouflage, but it's kind of yellow.  Oh, why is it...  Miss, why is it camouflaged? 
[02:17:00]  I don't know why.  That's how they made it.  Where are you camouflaged?  It looks like it's trying to blend into a golden shower.  It's very fall.  It's very fall-colored, Jimmy.  Very fall-colored.  It's a little bright for fall, don't you think?  Yeah.  I was trying to tell him that, but he doesn't know anything about fashion.  No, I know.  That's from Brooklyn Industries, who makes that bag.  Right?  Right, right.  Yeah.  There you go.  Exactly.  She looked and she knew that you looked at the label.  What are you doing to stay warm, Miss?  I didn't know my purses.  She's drinking coffee. 
[02:17:30]  That's right.  Don't walk into the camp.  I used to know a lot of black gentlemen who stole them.  She's just trying to match her face.  Whoa, what happened?  Whoa, I like this cabbie.  Yes, my friend.  Wow.  A cabbie tried to run us over.  That was a real scumbag move.  Yeah.  Oh, the sun's out again.  Oh, that's good.  Rano, you'll miss whatever you're running for, Miss.  Oh, my God.  Run.  That's a shiny coat.  You have a shiny coat on.  Well, that coat is shiny.  You're like a chocolate bar. 
[02:18:00]  Look like you've been dipped in a period pussy.  Oh, God damn it.  What'd you yell?  Did you yell something?  Probably.  Oh, Jimmy, man.  Oh, no.  I heard everybody laughing.  No, it's hilarious.  I'm with you.  Trust me.  She's mad.  Sarah McLachlan has a new disc out.  Ooh.  Winter songs or something like that.  Hey, Bully, Jimmy.  Oh, Jesus.  Where?  Rockstar Games presents Bully.  Oh, does it? 
[02:18:30]  It's out now.  When is Laszlo coming in with this game?  Monday?  Jimmy's in Bully.  How did I not get an advanced copy of Bully?  Jimmy, the character, the main character looks like Jimmy.  Are you the main character in Bully?  No, but I have a decent part.  It looks like Jimmy, though.  A lot of people are saying.  Look, you're all mean.  Put on a mean face, Jimmy.  All right.  That ain't it.  Hey, wait.  We got a lot of new posters up today.  Oh.  Bat Out of Hell 3 from Meatloaf.  Let it go, Meatloaf. 
[02:19:00]  He's going back there.  Ew.  Is he?  See Meatloaf live.  The very best of Aerosmith.  Devil's got a new disguise.  16 classic hits plus two brand new songs.  Always got to have the two brand new songs, right?  I like the disc.  You know what's good about the Bat Out of Hell 3 thing?  Our intern got a little work with the picture.  They used his photo.  Nosferatu.  Nosferatu.  There's only one.  What's this about?  And what's this about?  You're pretty good at this thing.  There is only one. 
[02:19:30]  What?  Jay-Z?  Is it Jay-Z?  See, I wouldn't know.  Why would I know that?  Is he coming out of retirement?  Is he out of retirement?  I wouldn't know.  Halloween is coming, and so is Alice Cooper.  What?  What happened?  Who are you?  What?  Oh, my name is Daniel.  Hi, sir.  Oh, no.  Hi.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  Paranoid idiot that dropped something the other day.  Paranoid guy.  He's a paranoid guy, man.  The video on YouTube is great.  What's up, bro?  What are you doing today?  Okay, good, good.  How are you? 
[02:20:00]  Good.  I got to ask you.  Yes.  You shaved this morning, right?  Yes, I did.  Was it dark?  You might have missed a few spots.  Were you in Buffalo when you shaved and there was no power?  No, no, no, no, no.  What happened?  You missed, like, you got the tiniest little Hitler mustache, and then you missed kind of  the right side of your face on the upper lip and under the lip.  And I know sometimes my razor doesn't work that much.  You really missed a lot.  Yeah. 
[02:20:30]  You got a mirror?  Yes, I do.  What do you do for a living?  I'm a messenger for a dental lab.  Oh, really?  So, uh...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that...  Can you start a fire with your glasses?  No, no, no.  I bet I could use them and...  Oh, no, no.  I can't.  Like, and start a fire with the sun.  No, no, no.  Burn ants with them?  Do you burn ants with your glasses?  They're very thick.  Oh, this guy likes fires, because he backed up some fire. 
[02:21:00]  You like fire.  Fire's good.  I like fire, too.  Fire's fun, though, right?  Fires are fun.  Sometimes.  You have nothing to do with that fire on the east side this morning, do you?  70th and Park?  Big fire, very suspicious.  You had nothing to do with that?  No, no, no.  You sure, right?  Positive.  Because we got some cops among us.  They might want to question you about the fire.  No, no, positive.  You're positive, all right?  Are you a fire bugster?  What?  Yeah, he's a fire bug.  You like fire, though?  No, no, no.  Do you like a fire that masturbate watching it?  No, no.  This guy likes fires.  Look at him.  You can just tell.  He's just backing up a little bit more each time. 
[02:21:30]  He backs away a little bit.  So what are you doing if you're not messengering?  No, I go to synagogue on Saturday.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah?  So you're of the Jewish faith.  Did you build your sukkah?  Yes, yes.  What's a sukkah?  What's a sukkah?  What's a sukkah?  It's a hut.  You know, at the Russian Shining of Kepa, we have sukkahs.  Sukkah.  What is it?  It's a hut that you build out of what?  It's a Jewish holiday.  We eat in the sukkah after the services. 
[02:22:00]  But where do you build it?  In the shul.  And some real religious people build it in their backyard.  Oh, really?  Yes.  And then people come over.  Yeah, we have festival meals.  Oh, I got you.  That's cool.  You like Mel Gibson?  Yes, I do.  He's all right, right?  Yes.  He doesn't seem to like the Jewish people.  Yes.  Oh.  No, yeah.  Oh, I don't know.  He said some nasty things when he was drunk.  I don't know.  You don't like that part of him, right? 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't you find it a little weird that you shaved a little Hitler mustache on yourself?  Yes.  Being Jewish?  Yes, I'm sorry.  Isn't that like a bit of irony there?  Yeah.  But I got to go.  I have to go on my delivery.  Oh.  We got an officer.  Dental work.  Dental stuff.  No, no, I can't.  I can't.  What do you got?  What do you got?  Confidential information.  What do you got?  You got any drugs?  Teeth, bridges, crowns.  What do you got?  You got drugs?  Isn't that a little odd?  A little weed or something?  You have a Hitler mustache and you're transporting people's teeth?  No.  Like, you are just a walking irony. 
[02:23:00]  But I got to go.  I got to go.  You are just a walking irony.  Why?  Why do you got to go?  Delivery, delivery.  I'm ready.  Wait, wait.  We think you're hiding something now.  You got to go.  You're not in lampshades, too, are you, sir?  No?  All right.  They like following.  All right.  They love following paranoid guys.  Yeah, it's one of those things.  They're just following them now up the sidewalk.  We will.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  That's her?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll do her outside XM.  What radio station?  What radio station?  They're just following them up the sidewalk.  What's she going to do? 
[02:23:30]  She's a contortionist.  Oh, she's a contortionist?  Yeah.  She is?  You used to be a gymnast.  Are you also a gymnast?  I'm a gymnast.  I'm a gymnast.  I'm a dancer.  I'm kind of a contortionist.  Kind of a contortionist?  So, yeah.  And why don't we set this up?  We started a new thing, I guess, last week.  It's kind of like a talent show on the walkover.  There's a lot of people trying to get our attention, so we figured, all right, we're walking  every day in the streets of New York.  If you've got something really cool, you just get a hold of us, and we'll let you perform  on the street. 
[02:24:00]  And she's a contortionist, and she wants to do some contortioning.  She's shaking.  I am.  Why are you shaking?  You're shaking.  Because I listen to you guys rip everybody apart every morning, and now I'm on the spot.  Hey, she's got purple hair, too, just like you.  Look, she's got purple hair.  Yeah.  Yeah, talk to her.  Talk to a little lady who looks like Stink.  Well, you should be scared of Norton.  What would you like me to say?  Why the purple hair?  Whoa.  Why the purple hair, ma'am?  Why not?  Got to zip it up a little bit.  Yeah, certainly do. 
[02:24:30]  Where are you from?  You can tell.  We're from Vancouver, Canada.  Ah.  I'm blown in an alley.  Our brothers to the north, as we like to call Canada.  We love New York.  Or that useless piece of real estate.  Fabulous.  All right.  Do you have fun in New York, ladies?  Hope you get a stiff one while you're here.  Exactly.  Against your will, it's dark.  Yeah, you shouldn't have to worry.  All right, contortionist, where do you want to do your thing?  This looks good.  Kind of cleaner over here.  Yeah, it's a little cleaner.  Hey, do you think you can get a big square?  What's the same to me? 
[02:25:00]  Because you contort your hiney into my face shape.  I don't know.  Let's see.  It's my face.  Can I trust you guys not to steal my $10 old navy bag thing?  Yeah, don't worry.  Listen, everyone, get off the stage.  The stage is this thing.  Go around this thing.  She's very petite.  She's petite like a gymnast.  I'm just going to warm up a little bit, do some walkovers, back and front walkovers.  All right.  I like to walk over.  She has to wash her hands.  Hey, where are you from?  Brooklyn.  Brooklyn.  Make sure she washes her hands after this.  She washes her hands before we touch. 
[02:25:30]  Because she is.  All right, wow.  All right, whatever.  She's nimble.  That's like.  Now she's doing it back.  She's just warming up.  Whoa.  All right, this is kind of.  She's.  Oh, oh, oh.  That's okay.  Jesus, don't break your neck.  You almost did it.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  Watch out.  She's sharp and coming through.  She's doing like this thing where she bends over backwards, gets on her hands.  Yeah.  And then she hangs her legs over the top of her head, leaning on her hands and her elbows 
[02:26:00]  only.  I'm going to go old school, Ann.  And she's trying to flip her legs up.  Ann, I'm going old school.  She's trying to do Olga Corbett.  Olga Corbett on the balance beam did that one.  And they used to show her face on the beginning of the Wide World of Sports.  Right.  Hey, stop shaking.  You're good.  We're not going to mess with you.  Yeah, you're so nervous.  You guys can mess with me.  I'm like.  Are you cold?  I'm cool.  What?  Are you cold?  A little bit.  Could you do this in a skirt?  I'll do this in a skirt for you, Jimmy.  Wow, Jimmy.  I'm filling up.  All right.  She's going to try something else. 
[02:26:30]  At least there's something warm out here.  Can I just.  Yeah, nuzzle it.  Oh, she's doing a split.  All right, split.  A little split.  And she's now got her head by her.  The bottom of her foot.  Another split going this way.  Boring.  Boring.  All right.  That could be it.  You guys got to go do your thing.  No, no, no, no.  You got to give us something really good to.  Okay.  You got to leave us with something good.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Maybe you can bend your mouth about Jimmy's cock.  Maybe. 
[02:27:00]  Because it's.  Maybe.  Cementia.  I haven't tried that one yet.  I might have to warm up.  Can you.  Oh, God.  Can you do.  Can you walk on your hands?  Not really.  Okay.  Okay.  Sorry, guys.  Can you do an ordinary cartwheel?  Yeah, I'm pretty ordinary, I guess.  All right.  Let's see.  Can you do an ordinary cartwheel?  Cartwheel.  Can you do a cartwheel?  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  There you go.  Let's see.  A cartwheel.  A cross 57th.  That's nice.  Yeah.  All right.  She gets good points for that. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, she's cute.  I get points for that.  Okay.  What else can I do?  Oh, we're just looking for people that do little talenty things.  She has one of these.  Is she retarded?  Our pal is back.  What'd you make your delivery?  Paranoid guy's back.  Paranoid guy.  You made your delivery?  What happened?  Hold on, sweetheart.  You made your delivery already?  The dentist is closed.  The dentist is closed?  What, what, what?  The dentist is, like, up to his clothes on Friday.  Is it safe?  Jimmy, is it safe?  I think he's talking about a massage therapist.  Oh, he's a creep.  Look at him.  Look at him.  What a, yeah, he is a ghoul.  Have a good weekend. 
[02:28:00]  They just follow him down the sidewalk.  What radio station are you?  They just follow him and they don't talk to him.  They just film him.  Look at this family of foreigners coming down.  Where are they from?  It's an entire family.  What radio station are you?  And they must be foreigners.  Hi, where, where are you from?  Oh, are you talking about Brazil?  Brazil?  Brazil?  Hi, Brazil.  Wow.  Have fun in New York.  Weird to fucking not have to pay for it, huh?  Wow, look at this guy.  He's really conformed to the white man's look.  Here's something you don't see every day.  How you doing, bro? 
[02:28:30]  All right, man.  I call him bro.  Just so you know.  All right.  It beats the other word they don't like.  We need the big finish.  What do you got, Aurora?  The big finish.  What do I got?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I can do a headstand.  All right.  What's the record?  All right.  I'm all right.  I can do it.  I can do it.  I think at this point we've got to ask her, what's the real reason she's here today?  What did he say?  She used the contortionist thing as an excuse.  She wants to know the real reason you're here.  Now, there she goes.  She's getting up into a headstand. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, hold.  No, no.  She can't hold it.  Hold.  Oh.  Hold it.  Wow.  You're shaky.  She's nervous.  Did you drink last night?  You are.  Oh, and then to a split.  What do you think?  Oh, and then you see some hiney crack.  Oh, I like that.  Oh, hiney crack.  It's Friday morning.  I'm not, you know.  Are you giving us an oopsie?  That was an oopsie.  Oh, God.  You got plumber crack this.  My mom is listening.  You guys don't understand.  Oh.  I'm so embarrassed.  Hey, do you have a tramp tag?  Yep.  Let's see your tramp tag. 
[02:29:30]  Tramp tag.  That's smart.  It's not bad.  It's a little fish hole.  You got a little tat.  Well, it's the Aries, and then after I got this thing permanently branded on my back,  You realized you're not an Aries.  I realized it looks like an ass crack or like an arrow.  Like, oh, what's that pointing down to?  Hey, it's a good thing you're not a cancer because that would be a crab crawling out of  your ass.  That's very good.  Watching her.  You gave me a rod.  Really?  Did you fill up?  Thank you, Jimmy.  Want to see his rod?  That's what I was, well, no.  My mom is listening.  Her mom is listening.  Oh, I'm sorry. 
[02:30:00]  She loves you guys.  Really?  What?  That's good.  I said, really?  Yes, he's been listening to you guys since NEW.  Ah, the good old days.  I remember that.  Jimmy, we ruled back then, Opie.  We fight over the XM.  Like, who's going to get to take the XM to work so we can listen to you guys?  Ah, that's nice.  Wow, and you came down to do a little gymnastics.  So that's really why I came down.  I just wanted to see you guys.  Yeah.  Jimmy, oh my God, he's not kidding.  No, get away from me with that thing.  All right, that's my big finish.  I gave Jimmy Woods, so.  You gave Jimmy Woods.  There's the ta-da. 
[02:30:30]  How old are you?  21.  Cool.  Legal.  Whoa.  The wood's going down.  All right.  Thank you.  Well, very good.  Thank you.  Take a picture of us.  What was your name, Miss?  Aurora.  Aurora?  All right, there's a little picture-taking happening.  All right, I guess that's it for today.  You were very nice.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Do you want to come up and watch the show a little while?  Yes.  Oh, my God, yes.  Okay.  All right.  Aurora.  It's like the Northern Lights. 
[02:31:00]  Aurora bore us.  Aurora.  Aurora.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow.  How long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:31:30]  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  And we're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, cornwalls, three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm Dave. 
[02:32:00]  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We're in love. 
[02:32:30]  Thank you.  We're in love.  We'll be right back. 
[02:33:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:33:30]  I like getting in here first.  I got the choice of the soupy.  I got chicken chili today, and they only brought one.  Can you believe it?  I want to try the chicken chili, too.  They brought crab bisque, I think, and beef goulash, and all kinds of good stuff. 
[02:34:00]  Goulash is probably fattening, but good.  How was your leek, Jim?  Did you have to push it down?  No, my cock looked really good when I was peeing.  It looked rich and full?  Yeah, it looked rich and full, like it was just naturally a fat, juicy appendage.  Yeah, there's a point that you can reach where it looks like it's not excited, but it just 
[02:34:30]  looks giant.  It's just hanging there.  Congrats.  Wow, it's really hot in here.  Yeah.  It's warm.  I like it.  It is since you walked in.  Thank God.  Oh, Jimmy.  I'm hungry.  Okay.  I need a kiss.  Thank you, bro.  All right.  Well, everybody grab some soup.  And we have to finish up the... 
[02:35:00]  Mel Gibson?  Yeah, we can do that.  I want to hear a little Mel.  All right, I just got to hear.  A little Mel.  Let's run Mel.  Yeah, first class ticket to the resurrection.  To the resurrection.  Well, that talent show's going great.  That is pretty good.  But, I mean, you know, the girl did a tumble salt.  She tumbled for you.  That's great.  That's great to see a grown woman do things that five-year-old girls could do.  She'll tumble for you.  I feel just the opposite way. 
[02:35:30]  All right.  Where's the rest of that Mel Gibson stuff?  Oh, right in front of me.  Very convenient.  Convenient.  Yeah.  Oh, it's so nice to be in a warm studio after that cold walk.  And now, mmm, chicken chili.  Smoothie, Anthony?  Okay.  Thank you, Kenneth.  Can I smell your chicken chili?  No.  Please.  No, you'll ruin it somehow.  I will not.  Yes, you will. 
[02:36:00]  You're a spoiler.  I've worked with you long enough to know.  You'll hock a loogie in it.  I wouldn't do that.  It'll be chicken and loogie chili.  What?  What do you want to eat?  I don't know.  I've got to take vitamins.  I've got a banana.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's eating time.  I need something fun.  The XM listeners love this part of the show.  Well, we got no break.  I get emails and stuff and read message boards about how they love when we come in from all  the energy that we give our FM show, and we just eat and sit around and don't give them 
[02:36:30]  shit.  That's what they think?  Oh, you get something like that.  You want to just crack them over the head, but I'm too busy eating.  And laughing and not giving anyone shit.  This part of the show has been better than the first half lately.  Just relax.  Our goal is to make both halves really good.  Oh, is that good?  If I ever catch Eric looking into my soup again, I'm going to take off his...  I saw you look into my soup.  Were you gazing into his soup lovingly?  You took that gander into my soup, and I didn't like it.  Don't look at his soup. 
[02:37:00]  Exactly.  All right, Mel Gibson, so more GMA audio from that wonderful, wonderful journalist, Diane  Sawyer.  Diane Sawyer, you can barely tell who she is.  There's a difference between saying that place is a tinderbox and the constellation of things  happening there could take us all down and saying the Jews are responsible for all the  wars.  Isolate her saying that.  Yeah, let's get her in trouble. 
[02:37:30]  Just isolate her saying that.  We got a clip of Diane Sawyer that you're not going to believe.  Diane Sawyer admits...  Why don't we start our own gossip show?  We should.  With just out-of-context lies.  Well, they're not lies, though.  I thought we already had one.  Hey, Thang, can you develop that?  Yes.  No, I'm not even kidding.  I think we could have fun with that.  Yeah, get people saying stuff out of context.  It's usually great when they're quoting other people.  Yeah, we're going to make our own gossip show.  And start with us.  Here's an exclusive.  Listen to what Diane Sawyer had to say. 
[02:38:00]  The Jews are responsible.  Well?  Uh-oh.  Strictly speaking, that's not true, because it takes two to tango.  What are the Jews responsible for?  What are they responsible for?  I think that they're not blameless in the conflict.  There's been aggression and retaliation and aggression.  It's just part of being in conflict and being of war. 
[02:38:30]  So, they're not blameless.  Of course they're not.  Of course they're not.  He was talking about World War II.  The ghettos were supposed to be kept neat, and they left the...  You know, they made it messy.  Can we get Bob Kelly on the phone?  He's stuck in Buffalo.  Let's try to get him on.  He was talking.  Dude!  Dude!  You know how to slide?  I told him, dude!  And I was the guy in Pal Talk with the Glock on cam.  Could you please unband me from the room in Pal Talk? 
[02:39:00]  The name is Lil' Jim Stalker.  If you ask the screeners, I call every day.  All right.  Lil' Jim Stalker.  Stalker.  Oh, he's a sweet boy.  And finally, one last clip.  Mel Gibson on Good Morning America.  In an earlier apology, he had asked the Jewish community for dialogue and help.  I heard back that a woman who had read the apology actually wept with relief.  Now, that sort of hit me.  I was like, relief?  Oh my God, she was afraid. 
[02:39:30]  She was terrified.  And, wow, you know, I don't think I realized until, like, a couple of four days later.  You're 50!  Five days later, that what I did was press a big fear button.  You didn't realize that?  I didn't realize the level of fear.  Shut your mouth, both of you!  What did you think it was?  Me?  It was just the stupid ramblings of a drunkard.  Pleaful banter.  Well, hang on, it's conceivable that they think I could be the next goose-stepping maniac 
[02:40:00]  to come into their neighborhood, you know?  I could walk normal.  Yeah.  You don't have to goose-step.  No one's afraid of you, Mel.  You didn't tap into fear.  The woman who wept with relief is a melodramatic horse's ass who's, like, in love with you.  They love, oh, Mel, now I'm not going to be able to watch this movie.  She wept with relief.  Thank God I still have a shot.  Maybe I'll come over. 
[02:40:30]  No, he won't, you fat Long Island house-frau.  Maybe Mel will love me.  Now we could watch his movies again.  Can you?  And enjoy them.  Let's get a Ryan to eat.  He's a white angel.  Ryan still comes off as quite an anti-Semite.  He is.  He doesn't like Jews, so what?  I mean, I'm not saying it's the right way to be, but it is your right to not like people  as long as you're not infringing on their rights.  His father, I guess.  What was it?  His father didn't like him either? 
[02:41:00]  Oh, he denied the Holocaust.  That's a little more than didn't like him.  Yeah.  They were murdered, and he thought it didn't happen.  All right, so he had a little problem?  Yeah.  Let's go to Ryan in the Holocaust.  That's unbelievable.  That goes beyond just a slight twinge of annoyance.  That's pretty much the home run of anti-Semitism is denying the Holocaust.  It never happened.  They're all living somewhere.  Really?  Ryan in Jacksonville.  Hey, guys.  How y'all doing this morning?  Better now.  Thanks.  Hey, Jimmy.  You're definitely my favorite comedian of all time.  I'm in Jacksonville. 
[02:41:30]  I'd love to get a picture with you this afternoon.  What time are you coming in?  I think I land at like 7.30 at night, but I have to go right to the military base.  The military picks me up, and I go to the military base on the military takes me.  The Air Force base.  All right, gotcha.  Hello.  It's a pleasure to talk to you.  No, he wants to meet you at the airport.  I know.  Yeah, I want to meet you at the airport and get us.  Military's picking me up.  No, the gig fell through.  We're playing at the Air Force base.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  All right, mister.  Let's go to Peter in Massachusetts. 
[02:42:00]  Peter.  The guy with the shoot me in Florida.  Yeah, great.  Peter.  Good morning.  Good morning, Peter.  Hello, Peter.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  Did I hear you correctly congratulating Jimmy on his thick, juicy penis?  That's pretty creepy.  Well, you know, he fills up.  I got to be honest with you, Peter.  It just comes with a job at this point.  We all know we're going to see Jimmy's penis.  We don't know what to tell you about that.  Exactly.  Sounds really bad.  I understand.  I didn't see his penis.  We pretty much see his penis. 
[02:42:30]  It's through his pants.  Did you call them trousers?  Oh, I thought you were in the bathroom watching him urinate and stuff.  If I was in the bathroom with him, how could I be in here getting the last chicken chili that  Dan didn't get?  During the break, during the break, you were like checking each other's junk out in the  men's room.  No.  We do that after work.  That would be gay.  I always try to peek, but they hide behind those stupid protectors that they have now.  The old buzz kills.  Yeah.  Those cock-walking pieces of metal.  Can't even get a good gander in a lab anymore. 
[02:43:00]  What sometimes I want to do is pee and help a boy suppress some memories.  When I was at the U.S. Open, I was in the bathroom and this guy next to me had to do Superman  pose.  I'm like, what are you doing?  Hands on hips.  No hands.  Just cock dangling.  No hands.  No view obstruction.  I don't like the trough.  That is just an animalistic way to take a piss.  You're shoulder to shoulder, men touching men, holding their cocks.  Usually filled with ice. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  Try to melt the ice.  Makes it into a fun little game.  Keeps the trap full of water.  All right.  Instead of piss.  All right.  A lot of people thanking Jimmy for going to Gitmo.  Hmm.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  We're going to regroup.  Anthony will be done with his chicken chili.  You can't handle the truth.  Dude.  You can't handle the truth.  Dude.  I watched the wall.  We'll get Bob Kelly on the line.  Girl dumped in ditch after dying during sex.  We'll get into that.  Oops.  And other things.  I didn't know.  Exactly.  It brings back the bit from earlier this week. 
[02:44:00]  I'm just like queuing an empty seat.  I'm just queuing an empty seat.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  And useless Travis just sits there and doesn't know what to do.  He just did his nails.  He doesn't want to touch anything.  And what's Danny doing, bumbling around?  I'm queuing a ghost.  That's terrific.  Danny's bumbling around, not doing things right, according to certain message boards.  Danny does a great job for us.  Of course he does.  I just like the fact that someone's shitting on him. 
[02:44:30]  Well, what's great is they're having a...  You were telling me.  I swear I didn't read this one.  There's a thread where they're trying to...  They're, what?  Deciding who does a good job behind the scenes and why?  It started yesterday because of the Bill episode.  Right.  Where Danny was trying to throw Bill under the bus.  And that turned out to be great stuff.  And message board people really kind of like Bill.  And they were pissed at Danny for trying to throw him under the bus and said, you know.  And then it kind of turned into a what the hell do these guys do thread. 
[02:45:00]  Where they're going, you know, I like Dan.  I think Dan does a good job, whatever that is.  Yeah, here it is.  Someone's like, what the fuck?  I'm reading that going, how could they critique people's jobs when they don't know what the fuck these people are even doing?  See, actually, I read that and thought, how'd they get in my head?  This is it.  I think Dan does a good job, whatever it is his job is.  Other than him, I know the names and voices, but don't know what everyone does.  Like Travis, Derek, Danny, Bill, etc.  Are they all just production guys?  Travis is eye candy. 
[02:45:30]  Alright, can we go to break now?  See, that was called filler.  That was filler right there.  Oh, yeah.  Learn to play poker with the Opie and Anthony Show.  No.  Oh, God.  He spilled my chip.  I'm sorry, sir.  Oh, Opie.  Oh, that's my fault.  I'll bring a little.  Now clean it up.  That's right.  Be a poker player, just like your father. 
[02:46:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Are you happy now, Opie?  Are you happy?  Are you happy?  Hey, let's go right to the phone and say hi to Stan in Georgia.  Stan, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Bob?  I bet they call you Stan the Man down there, right? 
[02:46:30]  Never heard it.  Anyway, you were, Opie, you were referred to yesterday on the Colin Cowherd Show on ESPN.  He was asked about some party he went to.  He goes, yeah, it was okay.  It was a bunch of B-list celebrities like Corey Feldman, Corey Haim, and that Opie guy from the Opie and Anthony Show.  Just thought you'd like to know.  You were at a party with the Corys?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Was I at this party? 
[02:47:00]  What's that?  Was I at the party, or was he trying to make fun of me?  No, no, he said you were at the party.  Were you at a party with the Corys?  No.  Corey Haim and Corey Feldman, they're dreamy.  Was he trying to make fun of me, you think?  I don't know.  He kind of just threw it in as a shot.  Possibly.  Possibly.  I would take B-list celebrity any day of the week, if you need to know.  What?  Wow, this is going nowhere.  They're telling me I'm going to let y'all go. 
[02:47:30]  This guy doesn't know how to carry on a phone conversation is what it is.  The guy just said they're telling me I've got to let you guys go.  Oh, okay.  Well, that was funny.  Redemption.  All right, let's say how to Bob Kelly's bitch and he's stuck in Buffalo.  Bob.  Yo.  Dude.  Dude, this is fucking Buffalo.  He almost said this is bullshit, then he realized he can't, like, it's not like something's doing something inconsistent.  What happened, Bobby?  Dude, God hates Buffalo.  Yes.  Yeah.  Who doesn't?  And?  This is the worst fucking place in the universe. 
[02:48:00]  Well, let's talk here, Bob.  You were up there for the, what, tourgasm?  I went up there to do this fucking show at a theater that probably seats 35,000 people.  And it was probably, you know, 15.  Was it a light crowd?  Yeah, it was a light crowd.  15,000 or 15 people?  15 people.  Oh, okay.  That's cool.  And there's two feet of snow.  Two feet of snow.  I'm stuck in this Marriott hotel that has no electricity for the last 24 hours. 
[02:48:30]  It's like Hurricane Katrina with white people.  You have no electricity in the Marriott?  There's none.  There's none.  And there's a bunch of fucking zipper heads walking around with fucking dirty suit jackets.  He's comparing a snowstorm in Buffalo and having no power in his hotel room for a couple hours with Katrina.  In his comfortable hotel room.  What are you eating, Bob?  I did say for white people.  I had nothing to eat.  They offered us Rice Krispies and apple juice this morning. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, how nice of your find.  That's a cute little, yeah, breakfast.  The airport's closed.  There's no electricity all night long.  All you heard was power.  Those big transformers just exploding.  Yeah, it was pretty bad in Buffalo.  It's terrible.  It's terrible.  Is it still snowing?  No, it's now.  It's actually the nicest day I've ever seen in the last week and a half.  The sun's out now, but there's two feet of snow everywhere. 
[02:49:30]  And the airport's shut down.  Rent the cars are shut down.  The highway's shut down.  There's a bunch of people with carry-on bags and friggin' black coats just milling around the friggin' lobby.  And I'm not getting out of here.  I'm not getting out of this.  How are you entertaining yourself?  How am I entertaining myself?  Yeah.  Did you say how am I?  I'm not.  You gotta do something.  Where's Gary and Jay?  I had fucking, I had tea candles in my room last night.  I was trying to meditate. 
[02:50:00]  Gary and Jay are in the lobby right now.  Jay keeps coming up with stupid ideas.  I want to slap him in the fucking face.  Like what idea?  Well, dude, we should go to the airport.  The plane's leaving.  It says it's leaving at 9 o'clock.  Does it, Jay?  Does it?  Really?  Does it, you fucking moron?  You don't think they're lying to you?  And they're gonna make it 10?  And then they're gonna make it 11?  And they're gonna make it 3 and 4 and 5?  They're pretty good up there, though.  Yeah, they're used to the snow, Bob.  They turn this stuff around fast. 
[02:50:30]  I hope Jay and Gary get out and Bob get stuck.  Thanks, Jim.  So where do you gotta be?  Back in New York?  I gotta be at the Egg in Albany tonight.  We gotta go there and do a gig.  But we're trying.  You know who's actually coming to pick us up  to try to get us out of here?  Huh?  The guy from, remember that Not You story?  The guy that drove me to the gig?  Yes.  That guy was here at 5 o'clock in the morning. 
[02:51:00]  Wow.  Wow.  Did you hear that?  You know something?  He didn't even put the mic to his ass.  Jesus Christ, I heard that buffalo  but the phone wasn't to my ear.  That was a nervous, I have to fly to Cuba for it.  Jimmy's a little scared.  The mic was like 4 feet from your ass.  Anthony, I got scared.  I thought that was another Transformer breaking.  Holy shit.  So wait a minute, the snow stopped.  They're clearing the roads now. 
[02:51:30]  No, nobody's clearing anything.  What time is your flight supposed to be?  My flight was 6.30.  And is it freezing cold or is it sunny but freezing cold?  No, it just got sunny out.  It just stopped snowing like 20 minutes ago  from yesterday afternoon.  It just stopped snowing.  Every tree is down.  All the power lines are down.  Dude, usually it's only three days that it takes them.  Yeah, you'll be fine.  It only takes them three days.  That's it.  You'll be fine.  Did you say three days?  Yeah.  Yeah, three days. 
[02:52:00]  That's it.  Oh, go fuck yourself.  Wait.  You got to get to Albany  which is way too far to drive.  No, it's not.  It's only four and a half hours.  Okay, yeah, but not in that weather condition.  It's fucking...  People are imagining your meditation  bum on 42nd Street.  Meditate.  Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.  Well, you better off flying, dude. 
[02:52:30]  The airport will be clear before the roads will.  No.  Okay, you would know.  Go ahead.  Do what you want.  Take a four and a half hour drive.  You're right.  I'm wrong.  They don't know how to clear the airports.  500 miles of road will be clear before one runway.  You're right.  Hey, hey, ass face.  The airport has no electricity.  The power grid exploded.  They have no electricity.  You better go on the road then.  Yeah, no shit.  That's what I told you, you asshole.  Oh, wow.  No electricity.  They have a generator.  They'll back it up, Bob.  That's right.  They have generators.  Dude, dude, dude, dude. 
[02:53:00]  There's no electricity at the airport.  They'll get it on soon.  Dude, dude, there's nothing.  The airplanes have electricity.  That's all you need.  Once you're up in the air, who gives a fuck?  Well, you can't get that little road thing to the plane.  Yeah, you can't do anything without electricity.  They can't even de-ice the planes yet.  De-ice the schmice.  A little ice.  Tom from Albany works for Train, can get Bob on one.  Who does he do?  He works for Train.  A train? 
[02:53:30]  It says works for Train.  Tom, Albany, what's up?  Hey, I can get this guy out of there.  I can't give him my phone name over the radio, but I can get him out of there.  I work for the Ram Track.  I can get him on the train and be down here in no time.  Well, let me ask you, are the tracks clear in Buffalo?  Go.  Oh, yeah.  You know, you're talking thousands of tons there.  The snow doesn't stop the train.  Well, you get that big train out in front with the big plow on it.  There you go. 
[02:54:00]  Is that what you use?  I like that.  Well, yeah, all the trains got plows on in front of them.  I love the train.  I love technology that's, you know, 100 years old.  Yeah, 100 years old.  150 years old, unchanged.  That's our motto.  Same day service, you know.  Oh, so you want to, how long of a train ride would it be from Albany, Buffalo to Albany?  Go.  Five and a half hours.  Five and a half hours?  Oh, screw that.  Well, you got to go.  Bob's got a gig tonight, Bob, because if your gig gets canceled tonight, you're going to lose the money, right?  Five and a half hours.  Just get your snowshoes and fucking walk.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:54:30]  Five and a half hours.  What time is it?  Bobby, will you be able to get to the train station?  Yeah.  Wait.  Is this guy still on?  No.  He's not?  Is he there?  No, he's gone, because I really believed that he could help you, so I said, fuck that.  Where is he?  What did you say, O.P.?  He could help me, so you said, fuck that.  Yeah.  You're a fucking psychopath.  The guy's got my only fucking probably chance out of Buffalo, and you just hit a button and canceled it? 
[02:55:00]  That's it.  The press of a button has just changed your life.  Yeah.  Bob, repeat after me.  Yeah.  Dude.  Yeah, just meditate with your tea candles.  Yeah, just keep meditating.  Where's the, where's the, well, since you're losing tea cells, you might as well have tea candles.  But where's the guy with the train?  The guy with the train is fucking gone.  Now I'm back to the guy with the frigging car.  Oh.  Your train will be easier than a fucking car.  Well, then again, no electricity. 
[02:55:30]  They might not be able to get the train in.  Oh, I'll be in Buffalo.  Hey, here's an update.  Seriously, just in Long Island.  From the FAA, due to snow removal, the Buffalo-Niagara International Airport was closed as of October 13th at 5.15 a.m.  The date time when the airport is expected to reopen is October 13th at noon.  Noon?  Noon.  There you go.  There you go.  And there can't be that many people there waiting to get out, so I'm sure it'll just be a breeze to get in.  No people.  Yeah, but I gotta fly into Newark and then drive to Albany. 
[02:56:00]  That's where my ticket is.  Ew.  What?  You're not just going right to Albany?  No, we were flying back to Newark.  Dude, Albany's right, like.  Who booked your fucking travel?  Lewis and Clark.  Who booked your fucking travel?  Magellan.  Nice itinerary, Columbus.  Why are you doing that, Bob? 
[02:56:30]  That is stupid.  You're like a big star now.  Well, because we were going to go back to Newark, drive to Albany, and then drive to Philly.  Why don't you have Dane fly in with his private jet and pick?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm not flying on a Su-fly plane.  Su-fly plane.  Why, Bobby, you're going to have to fly directly.  You're not going to be able to make it.  What, your flight was supposed to be 6.30 a.m.?  My flight was 6.30, right.  All right, so you're going to land about 7.30, and you're going to be on the road about 8.30, 
[02:57:00]  9 o'clock, but now we've got a big problem because you're hours behind schedule.  Yeah, you've got to drive right to Albany, Bob.  Yeah.  I'm going to go rent the car.  Well, you're going to have, Bob, you're going to have to rent a car, you're going to go to  Albany, and then you're going to have to go right down to Philadelphia.  I would have took that train.  Well, you didn't.  The train sounded good.  Nah.  Yeah, the train might have helped you.  You'll be stuck there a while.  The hotel sink will look like it's full of rice pudding.  Yeah, have fun.  Just have fun there. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, take a little propeller plane.  You're going to have to rebook your flight.  The best of it.  Bob, this is an act of God.  It's a weather problem.  You're lucky you're going to get out of there at all.  I can't fucking stand you.  I'm trying to help you, Bob, but you're lollygagging up there in the dark.  Jay's down there racking his sweet little head.  I fucking hate you.  I hope, I swear to God, I hope he slips.  Hey, everyone is helping you out, man.  They're looking up flights for you.  There's a flight at, what? 
[02:58:00]  There's a 220 flight from Buffalo to Albany arriving at 330.  What airline?  USAir probably, some other one that fucking crashes every eight minutes.  It's got one wing on it, just flies in circles.  You guys keep giving me solutions, and they're taking them away from me.  Oh, sorry, that's the Corey Lytle airline.  Corey Lytle Air.  Hey, Bob, do you want a United flight?  We can connect you through Chicago, you horse's ass.  We're going to have to take Continental Houston and fly back to fucking Albany.  You're living planes, trains, and automobiles.  That's right. 
[02:58:30]  Have fun.  Did you say it was Corey Lytle who was going to fly that flight?  No, Corey Lytle, because Corey Lytle was never a person.  We don't know who Corey Lytle is.  Chuck Lytle and Corey Lytle.  Tom's back.  Tom.  Hey.  Hey there, Tom.  How you doing there?  Hey, I hope he hung up on you, but that's too bad, eh?  If you need a ride down there, I can hook you up.  You need a ride?  How can you get Bob?  I do.  You do?  All you got to do is show up at...  You fucking...  What's wrong with you, Opie? 
[02:59:00]  All you got to do is show up at...  What kind of fucking shooting?  Oh, what a massacre.  What the fuck?  You want to see this idiot in the fucking...  In the train station?  Dude, there was a guy named Tom from Albany.  Dude.  Dude, I'm just...  I'm here at the train station.  He said show up at the...  And then I got cut off.  Yeah.  All you have to do is show up at...  He's probably some queer, he's going to tell you to show up at the park restroom...  And there's going to be a ticket sticking through the glory hall you have to put in your mouth.  And then ticket juice will shoot in your mouth. 
[02:59:30]  Ticket juice?  That's a mouthful of ticket juice.  What the hell is ticket juice?  We'll find out.  Dude.  All right, hold on.  Tom's back.  I'm sorry.  All right, Tom's back.  All right, now we'll find out.  Tom.  Hey, buddy.  Hey there, Tom.  Sorry, the phones must be screwy.  Now, Tom, here's the thing.  You work for...  Hold on.  Hold on.  Listen to me.  Tom.  Hello.  You work for Amtrak, correct? 
[03:00:00]  Yes, I do.  Okay, you don't want to give me your name out, but what you're saying is that because there's  a delay, Bob can get it.  Um...  And...  And...  And yeah, here...  Whoa, whoa, whoa, Bob.  Don't interrupt me.  I'm trying...  Hold on.  ...to get to the bottom of this.  Yeah.  Hey, Opie, this one's for you.  Uh...  What?  What?  He hung up.  Oh, he hung up.  Oh, Bob.  Hey, that's great.  Thank you.  Kiss off... 
[03:00:30]  The only hope of me getting out of this shit hole, Tom...  So, Bob, is little Jay down there trying to figure out...  Dude, we can just hitch a ride with someone.  Yes, exactly.  Do you want to slap his face?  I want to rape it first.  Yeah, it's really rapeable.  What's Gary doing besides repressing rage?  He's, uh...  No, he's actually just very mellow, eating, uh...  Eating, uh, protein bars.  Yeah, of course.  He's treating it mellow.  But he's probably fucking ripped his mattress in half.  He ripped...  Hang on one second.  Hang on, hang on, hang on.  Hello.  What? 
[03:01:00]  Hello.  Hi.  What happened, Bob?  Oh, God.  All right, I gotta go.  Why?  What?  I have to go.  That was the...  That was the ride, people.  Okay.  I was hoping they'd kick you out of the hotel because it's noon or whatever.  No, I can...  They just...  That'd be hilarious.  They just throw you outside.  Yeah, you stay outside in the cold with your fucking fat ankle socks.  Why don't you call us from your cell phone once you're in the car and update us on conditions?  Yeah, let's, uh, see how this works out for you.  Yeah, it's...  Call us from the car, though.  I want to see how it's going.  I just hope it ends with a spin-out.  Yeah, exactly. 
[03:01:30]  You upside down in the ditch, freezing to death.  No, I really thought I was gonna call and get a little friggin' support out of you guys today  and maybe use some of your power, you know.  We're actually supporting the lake and Mother Nature.  I hope it ends with a...  What was it?  A hobbling?  A good hobbling.  Yeah.  I hope it ends with...  With Kathy Bates.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't have a fan to do that.  Oh, Bob.  Oh.  Oh, Bob.  Oh, Bob.  Hey, go down there and look at little Jay and his fucking newly coiffed hairdo. 
[03:02:00]  He's just got his highlights done, too.  It looks fantastic.  All right, Bob.  Actually, I think I just chipped my tooth.  Good.  All right, Bob.  All right, guys.  I'll call you later.  Thanks for your help.  Thanks for your help.  All right, Bob.  Thanks, Opie, for fucking me.  Bye.  See you on the radio next Friday.  Bye.  All right.  Bob Kelly.  There he goes.  I'll help you wind up in a snowbank.  All right, we'll break.  Girl dumped in ditch after dying during sex.  Next.  You're listening to The Suing Sound.  of Opie and Anthony. 
[03:02:30]  So sit back, relax, have yourself some herbal tea, close your eyes, and drift away with  O&A.  Big-ass cock.  Hi.  This is great.  You dick.  Bye.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Fuck all y'all.  Horrific and tasteless.  It's called sarcasm.  I've never heard anything as offensive and gross as you are. 
[03:03:00]  And that's why I'm signing up.  The Anthony and Anthony Show.  All right, finally, girl dumped in ditch. 
[03:03:30]  Ah, bringing the humor back to the show after dying during sex.  Kind of like our scenario from earlier in the week with the businessman and the dominatrix.  And he's just trying to have a little fun because he's away from home and all hell breaks loose.  Where did Jimmy go?  Why does Anthony get that clip? 
[03:04:00]  I love that clip.  Because I'm a clip guy.  Yeah, but which one did I ask for I never got?  There was a really good one I want.  Oh, I heard my sound machine's coming.  What?  I want my sound machine.  What?  I have some good ones, too.  What?  No.  What?  How about for a day?  No.  I think for a day I should have one.  I think that you would be surprised.  No, Spaulding.  With how judiciously I used it.  Judiciously.  And have some funny clips all saved up. 
[03:04:30]  You think so.  I do.  Is no filter Paul really going skydiving tomorrow?  Tomorrow.  He's going skydiving.  Is he doing the tandem jumping?  Is that what he's doing?  I hope he is with a guy made of lead.  Answer.  God damn it.  I think the pal talk froze up.  Yeah.  Yeah, because I was going to ask.  Because a lot of people there know Paul if he's going tandem jumping. 
[03:05:00]  You know the instructor is going to really think about unhooking.  Look at that poor guy.  He's got to strap that belly to him.  Paul's tiny fucking shrunken head with his juicy lips and his fucking Lego person hairdo.  That big gut fucking up the whole tandem jump feel.  Lomiting towards the earth.  Yeah.  Why is he skydiving?  I don't know.  God bless if you're into skydiving.  I don't.  I hope he skydives like Omar in Scarface.  Jesus.  All right, here we go. 
[03:05:30]  Girl dumped in, ditched after dying during sex.  Deputies are puzzled.  Is this the scene of a crime?  They know the victim and the suspect lives here in this mobile home community in Bithlow.  She was last seen in the residence that she lived at at the fence talking with the neighbor,  which lives behind him, I guess the guy she was dating.  And last week they were doing more than that, according to the suspect himself.  Kevin Dial, 35, claims he and Mary Beth Trowbridge, 19, were having sex here when she suddenly died. 
[03:06:00]  Having sex.  Sure.  That seems a little suspect right there.  Because she's young.  Because she's young.  If she's having sex.  Is he married, this guy?  Is he married?  Married man, are you?  By the way, Squeaky Wheel, give us a break.  Love you guys, but what's with the ton of breaks on the XM side?  Well, he's getting the grease.  Today we're doing a little more breaks on this side.  Yesterday we went an hour and 15 minutes without even taking a break.  Hour 15 without a fucking break. 
[03:06:30]  The majority of the days here at XM, we will go just about an hour at some point without a break.  It just happens.  It's the way it is.  And this motherfucker is bitching that we're taking too many breaks already.  We just get in here.  Oh my God, I hate some of these people.  I fucking despise some of our listeners.  Well, the new commercials that we're doing now, I mean, we have to get ready for the breaks  that you put in because we're going to be having the commercials like regular radio. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, yeah, they don't know.  Yeah, everyone knows that.  But that's going to...  Don't even start that because...  Oh, you already did.  You can sit here now and deny it until you're blue in the face.  Yeah.  All right, great.  So what's this story about?  I was distracted.  A girl was having sex.  I was having sex with this man.  Yeah.  Apparently she died during sex.  Yeah.  He then, what, dumped her in a ditch?  Mm-hmm.  What are you supposed to do?  And they're trying to figure out if this is a crime or not?  Sounds like murder. 
[03:07:30]  There's some kind of crime here.  Well, some kind.  But I think they mean, you know, is it murder or you just get rid of a body?  You don't get that much time for just fucking with a body.  Like if someone dies of natural causes in your house or something like that, then you  kind of leave them or you dump them in the dumpster or something.  That happened recently.  A couple of years ago.  So some guy died, this grandfather.  And the family, I think a daughter and a son, took him out and threw him in a dumpster. 
[03:08:00]  Just threw his body in the dumpster.  And the crime they got was kind of weird.  It was disposing of like some kind of biohazard waste.  So you don't get in trouble for it, really, that bad?  I don't see what's wrong with throwing a girl in a ditch after sex, whether she's alive  or not.  It's just what you're supposed to do.  Give her the old boot.  Open the door, out you go.  You know what amazes me when people bury the body?  Why the shallow grave?  You really do have a lot of time.  Work at it.  You're in the woods by yourself. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah.  You know, you're going to be discovered with the shallow grave crap.  The shallow grave, you've got to dig a hole.  You've got to dig.  Just spend the night digging a hole.  Deep.  Real deep.  As deep as humanly possible.  Because no matter how deep in the woods you are, how off the beaten path you are, some  fucking kid or hunter or someone is always going to find, and I thought it was a doll's  hand.  It looked like a mannequin.  Right.  Because it's a shallow grave with little leaves on top. 
[03:09:00]  A few leaves.  Just make the effort.  I dig.  Just keep digging and digging and digging.  That's right.  First hint that the sun's coming up, and you dump the body and start pushing the dirt  back in.  Carry it, and then whistle a happy tune as you leave the scene knowing you're safe.  Do one of these.  Wipe the dirt off your hands.  And go get a bagel.  Or you smear food all over it so the animals eat it.  What would you do?  What would you do?  They drag it.  Let's say you completely lose your mind. 
[03:09:30]  All right.  Someone dies, and you've got to get rid of the body.  What would go through your head?  I'd put them in a closet in the hotel where no one would find them.  There was a story of a bed.  Remember the hotel bed?  Oh, the...  Some...  There was a platform bed in this hotel.  I think this story was from Boston when we were up there.  And some guy either killed a hooker, or she died or something, and put her in the bed. 
[03:10:00]  Actually, in the platform part of the bed.  Now, lifted up the mattress, which was then sitting on this piece of plywood that was on  the platform, lifted the plywood, shoved the body under the plywood, put the plywood back  down on the mattress, and that was it.  There was no under the bed.  It was just kind of a thing.  And people were bitching about the smell of the room and everything, and it took a while  for them to actually find her.  How long?  But you found the story? 
[03:10:30]  Yes.  Ah.  True on Snopes.  On Snopes, yes.  Is this true?  I always check Snopes before I blurt out bullshit.  After repeatedly complaining about the smell in their room, a couple staying in a hotel  discovers the body of a murdered girl under their bed.  Isn't that nice?  Origins.  And the baby train, folklorist, Jen.  Oh, who can't?  Yeah, they go with the origins.  No, you can scroll down and find out what happened.  Folklorist.  On July.  In each of the following.  In each of the following.  In each of the following. 
[03:11:00]  All right, on, uh, yeah, here, uh, I'm working on a new bit right in front of everybody.  Okay, on, uh, no, no, I just, uh, we all do that too.  I know, you're trying to read me, you think you got it.  Uh, the kid learns the mystery of the fatal accident.  Oh, I hear it.  But now there's a fact that it's, it seems these days, all right, so let's see, in each 
[03:11:30]  of the following cases, oh, all right, let's see.  I smell it.  This is the dumbest bit ever.  The greatest, though.  Uh, and yeah, something like this.  On July 10th, it, no, that's not it, all right.  Um, uh, it's down further.  All right, it was, uh, in July 1996, no, it was, uh, yeah, changing inflection. 
[03:12:00]  Fine, no, okay.  All right.  I'll forget it, it's just true.  It's true.  I don't feel like reading today.  You do the reading.  Well, how long ago was this, Stan?  How about a date?  There's a lot of examples.  That's why a lot of, I don't know where to go.  How often does that happen?  Well, July 2003, there was a man checked in, and then there was June 10th, 1999, July 1996.  Looks like this happens from happening a couple of times.  Yeah, I would say, you know, that would make sense. 
[03:12:30]  Going back to 1994.  One time I was in Washington State, I checked in a motel, and I found a dead, almost naval  idiot hanging in the bathroom after he swallowed a wedding ring.  The wheels almost came off that one, but they stayed on.  I almost didn't hear naval aviator.  It sounded like something with a wedding ring in his navel.  No, it was almost naval aviator.  Yeah, Jesus, this guy thinks way too much. 
[03:13:00]  Good way to bury a body is to bury a dog on top so you can't smell human.  Holy crap.  And then they find the dog, and they think that was the smell.  Dude.  Chris.  That's not good.  Chris.  Yeah, yeah.  What novel did you get this out of?  No, actually, my friend's a deputy.  He said the best way to get rid of a body is to bury the body deep and then bury a dog  on top of it.  So then they smell something, they dig it up.  Oh, dead dog, okay.  Let's close this case.  And they don't dig any deeper.  Does it still smell?  Right.  Yeah, but they probably think it's the remnants of the dog. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  Well, I mean, the body's only going to smell for a certain period of time.  That's not bad.  That's not really bad.  Yeah.  But how about if you bury the dog under the body?  That's stupid.  Then the dog police will be after you.  Yeah.  Hey.  McGruff the crime dog.  Someone's got to help us out today.  I think burning.  Charlie Thomas.  Thank you, sir.  You got to burn the body.  You bet.  And then dispose of it somehow in the water. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah.  Well, the ice man would put it in vats of acid, which has got to make it untraceable because  the acid would be acid.  Yeah, acid is very good.  See, the problem is it's not just how you dispose of the body.  It's what you use to dispose of it, how you acquired it, why you would have needed it in  the first place, and any paper trail that leads to you.  So you could come up with the best way to get rid of a body, but then the whole act of  getting rid of it is what then gets you in trouble.  And you can't Google body disposal.  No.  Let me try. 
[03:14:30]  You can't.  Oh, well, you can.  Yeah, great.  Why don't you try their thing?  The fan is Johnny on the spot.  Hey, Charlie Thomas from Montana.  Help us out.  My 84-year-old radio TV professor has been talking about you guys for the last 20 minutes.  I'm going to shut up.  He's an old ABC News producer for like 30 years, and he loves you guys.  I listen online in class.  Oh, I'm kidding.  He's a wonderful man.  The guy's in the middle of class, and he's listening to us.  Tell that older gentleman thank you very much.  Have him call the show right now.  Yeah, we'd love to talk to him on air. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah, that'd be kind of cool.  We'll teach the class.  Put us on speaker.  Yeah, that'd be great.  Oh, wow.  This is cool.  Jason in Texas.  Jason?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Hey, yeah.  Me and a couple of my buddies when we were 18 walked up on a dead guy.  We were out hunting.  He had froze, I guess, a couple nights before, and I was just sitting there propped up against  the tree with his eyes.  You in a hedge maze?  Still holding his gun.  What's that?  With an axe in his hand?  No, no, no.  He was still holding his gun, man.  But I'll tell you what, if you live with a chick and she dies, man, you're... 
[03:15:30]  Hold on, hold on.  I want to go back to your story because I didn't hear a lot of the details.  So, found dead guy in woods when you were 18.  It was a guy that killed himself?  No, no, no.  He had been out hunting, and I guess a heavy-ass snow come down.  He got lost and disoriented and just sat next to a tree and froze, just sitting there,  sitting straight up next to the tree, man, holding his gun still.  Probably had some drink in him.  Right at us.  Frozen dead guy?  Hey, when you walked up to him, were you going like, hey, hey, mister, or hey, how you doing? 
[03:16:00]  Well, we saw him.  Yeah, we saw him.  I'm like, dude...  You were talking to a dead guy.  You're a dope...  You idiot.  No, I wasn't...  How you doing?  Cup of Joe?  Yeah.  But, hey, back to that deal.  The girl dies on you, man, and you're married, and you're fucking around on your own lady.  You're not thinking...  Right.  You're panicking, man.  You ain't got shovels normally in your trunk, you know?  You're just panicking, trying to do anything to get the fuck out of it.  Ah, dude, I dig a hole in my fingernails all night long. 
[03:16:30]  That CSI shit gets you, though.  All night long.  All of a sudden, you know, they got one piece of hair, they find dirt under your fingernails  that match, like, an area that you weren't in.  Like, they just have all that shit down now.  Yeah.  You would have to plan a spontaneous death that you then had to cover up, like, this guy's  talking, you're cheating or something, and you want to get rid of the body.  Spontaneous like that?  You're screwed.  I mean, even if you really think it out, you're going to be screwed. 
[03:17:00]  I know what the latest thing is?  Hey, Anthony.  Oh, God.  Oh, why don't you just talk?  No, I'm sorry, guys.  Anthony.  Yes.  What?  I deal with guys like you of your caliber every day, man.  I'll haul cars for the rich and famous, the elites.  Ah, very nice, sir.  Yeah, from the Shelby Cobra's, the Saline, the S7, the GT Carreras.  Thanks for adding that.  Oh, thank you, sir.  But I'm going to let y'all go.  I talked to you.  Ah, he's going to let us go.  The latest with the dead body thing? 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  They have learned recently.  That the reflection of the last person you see before you die is in your eyes.  Punch that into Snopes as bullshit.  Jesus Christ.  Imagine that.  They could read off of your retina.  The last thing you see before you die is in your eyeballs.  I don't think so.  No.  Yes, yes.  Fuck, is it off camera?  Huh?  It's not a camera.  It is.  It takes a lot of pictures.  That's what motion pictures are. 
[03:18:00]  The last thing you see is right there in the back of your eye.  That sucks.  What if it's a fucking, what if it's the testicles of a rapist?  20 minutes of talking.  We should take a break.  Let's get to those commercials.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  More on the ditch.  Deputies know for sure this is a crime scene.  This ditch off State Road 50 in Titusville is where a passerby discovered Trowbridge's  body on Sunday, lying face down, decomposing, half naked. 
[03:18:30]  And Dial admits to dumping her here with the help of a friend.  They dragged her body from the mobile home to the car and eventually to the ditch.  Dial only called deputies after he saw pictures of her jewelry and clothing we showed you in  our newscast.  I have some feeling that maybe it could be an accident just by knowing him a little  bit, you know, because he seemed like a nice guy.  But then again, you don't really know people until you know what they're capable of doing.  And that is the question. 
[03:19:00]  Deputies say they know Dial is capable of other crimes.  He has a long criminal history, including an arrest for attempted murder.  Making fan look that up, Anthony.  It's just a little joke.  He started to touch me.  He started to grab me.  I told him to stop.  He didn't stop.  I hit him back.  And then he got really angry.  He pushed me out of the car.  Did he?  I wish it was her. 
[03:19:30]  She just stinks.  Who pushed you out of the car?  Strasburg?  Stanislavski?  A lot of things going on.  I turn to my left and is Googling.  Last thing you see before you die.  I had actually come.  It's a little joke.  Yeah.  And then we got Chris in Pennsylvania.  Chris?  Hey, Ann, you called that last call of the hunter guy an idiot for talking to a dead guy.  You had a conversation with Jimmy's ass.  Yeah.  At least Jimmy's ass is alive and vibrant and full of life. 
[03:20:00]  And lickable.  Do we have that really fast?  Can we find Anthony talking to Jimmy's ass?  I did talk to Jimmy's ass.  You did.  Unbeknownst to me.  And then he emailed it.  We still chat every so often.  We're not as close as we used to be.  Sometimes I'll sleepwalk and I kind of wake up and on my face to the floor, my asshole  is tapping away at the keyboard.  Shaka, shaka, shaka, shaka.  Send.  Oh, wow.  The retina thing is from Wild Wild West with Will Smith.  I didn't see that movie. 
[03:20:30]  Is it?  Got it?  Here it is.  All right.  We'll take a break, I guess.  No!  Why not?  I don't want to take a break.  I don't have to.  That smoothie, by the way, was piss warm.  What?  That I heard, mm-hmm.  Who said that?  Did someone say something?  Did you say that?  I swear to God, I cut a gasser and it went, your ass talked to me.  No, you fucking answered it. 
[03:21:00]  I answered your ass.  What'd you say?  We're back live.  That's terrific.  Goddamn, that is funny.  Yeah, because your ass went, huh?  First of all, my smoothie was piss warm.  Huh?  Huh?  What?  And then I'm like, what?  Who said that?  Jimmy's asshole was having a little chat.  Yeah.  Oh.  Huh?  All right.  Final clip. 
[03:21:30]  Ditch girl.  He said he freaked out.  This guy's been in prison in Illinois.  He's been in prison in Florida.  He got out of prison a year ago.  Last thing he needed was a cop showing up at his trailer with a dead woman laying on the floor.  And neighbors here speculate that her death may have had something to do with drugs.  But deputies say before they can even discuss that, they have to wait for toxicology reports.  They also have to wait on an autopsy before they can file any additional charges, if there will be any.  Meanwhile, Dial remains in jail on $100,000 bond. 
[03:22:00]  Wow.  Sounds a little fishy to me.  Yeah.  Yeah, especially since she was decapitated.  So we were having sex and her head just fell off.  That's your defense.  You want to stick with that one there, fella?  Yeah, I don't know what happened.  You want to go with something else?  Give you a chance to change that story.  Could be a lot of the trailer trash, because that's what it sounds like that it was, into that crystal meth.  Into that crystal meth. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, one of our faithful listeners is on the phone here.  Who?  Yeah.  Hello?  Hey.  What was this?  Hey.  How's it going, bud?  This is Pete from Staten Island.  Hey, what's up, Pete?  Hello, Pete.  Pete was on TV this morning.  We saw you.  Oh, you saw me?  Great.  Yeah.  You know, she found out that I'm a big fan of you guys, and you had to see the look of  terror in her face.  She actually gave me her cell phone number, wanted me to talk to you guys, and then call 
[03:23:00]  her back today and let her know what you guys said.  Wait, what's this?  In the office before the show today, they were doing a Mets thing, and Pete's on the walk  over almost every day, and his wife's beautiful.  You have six kids?  Six kids, yeah.  All from her?  No, no, no.  She has four daughters from her first marriage, and I have the son and daughter from my first  marriage.  So how many births has she given?  What?  Four. 
[03:23:30]  How many births has she given?  Opie questioned himself.  How many births has she given?  What?  What did you just say?  I'm trying to give you a compliment, because she's really, really hot, and her body is still  right there after four kids.  Absolutely.  They hang out at F.A.  Trolley's as well, and they were on TV this morning because Pete's a big Mets fan, and what,  your wife's a Yankee fan?  The wife and all the kids are Yankee fans.  Yeah, so wouldn't that story have really washed a little better before the Yankees were out 
[03:24:00]  of it?  Well, what happened was, we were in the Daily News last week, they did a story about couples  fighting.  So I guess Fox 5, you know, read that story, and then they found out that I'm a retired  fireman.  They called up the fire department press desk to get my phone number, and then they said,  oh, can we come over?  This was, you know, yesterday.  They said, can we come over?  So I said, yeah, come on over.  So that's how they got the story.  Ah.  But she, you know, I told her that I'm a big fan, and I see you guys every day, and 
[03:24:30]  she was talking about how you guys are mercilessly, you know, tormenting her when you guys used  to do the assault on the media.  No.  I don't even think we, it was Andrea Day, right?  Yeah, Andrea Day.  She said you guys used to chase it down when she was doing a lot of these informative,  before she was just a regular reporter, she used to do these.  She stinks, first of all.  She's one of these investigative reporters that goes after, like, insurance scams and,  you know, knocks on people's doors and acts real tough.  Yeah.  She's one of those.  Shame on you people. 
[03:25:00]  Where's the long, like, trench coat or black coat?  Yeah.  Kind of like a, you know, like she's getting something dumped.  Like she's a detective.  Yeah, there you go.  She came in once and was trying to spin some story.  Remember, it was the guy that admitted, Eddie the murderer.  Eddie the murderer.  This guy called her show, admitted to some horrific murder.  Back in the late 70s or something like that.  Yeah, that he burned some people up.  No, that was only about a year ago he called.  Oof.  Wow. 
[03:25:30]  That was, the magnitude of that, Bob.  By the way, that's what they thought happened.  That was the tremor they felt in Korea.  It was that fucking joke hitting the cement.  Wow.  Uh, and we all believed Eddie's story because it just sounded like, oh, well, okay, someone  found it funny.  Everyone was buying, everyone was buying Eddie's story there, including the media, and they 
[03:26:00]  came to the station.  They all wanted to interview us.  Oh, yeah.  Andrea Day is in there.  She's trying to feel us out, like, trying to figure out if we were making it up or something.  And then, he lied, right?  In the end, when the detectives, yeah, pounced on his house, they opened the door and they  found a crazy person.  Yeah.  And it got back to us.  The detectives basically said, they interviewed all of us and everything, and the detectives  were like, ah, don't worry about it.  We have, uh, we have, uh, we have proof that this guy did not murder anyone.  He's just crazy.  Yeah.  There was something they found, or how he looked or something, that this made his story 
[03:26:30]  ridiculous.  His story fell apart.  So, but it was, uh, interesting radio for like a day, day and a half.  Everyone was like, what?  But anyway, Mets, Yankees, yeah.  It was a good piece this morning there, Pete.  Thanks, I hope I told her to show up for a walkover, but I guess she, uh, she didn't  show up this morning.  No, of course not.  Of course not.  Well, tell her.  All right.  Well, Pete, we don't have much else.  It was a good piece.  What can I tell you?  Go Mets.  Go Mets. 
[03:27:00]  All right, man.  See you.  We'll see you on the walkover.  I'll see you tomorrow night.  Where?  At F.A.  Droneys.  Oh, you're going?  All right, cool.  Yeah, last pass standing with my brother, emceeing 400 New York Avenue and Huntington  Village.  We'll all be there.  Not all.  I'll be there.  And might show.  All right, thanks, Michelle.  I'm going to Michelle.  Sorry.  Thanks, Pete.  Okay, bye.  We got Michelle.  She has a dead guy story.  Michelle in Seattle.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Um, yeah, my brother-in-law lives just south of Buffalo, you know, so you know how much 
[03:27:30]  snow they get, while last winter, his next-door neighbor's daughter called, asked if he can  go check on her dad.  He goes next door, and there's the old guy, laying in his driveway in his pajamas, dead,  freaking solid as a rock, man.  In his PJs?  Yeah.  He just wandered out, some old fart wandered out in his driveway in his pajamas, and there  he was, laying in the driveway, just dead as a doornail. 
[03:28:00]  You're calling him an old fart?  I've got to go outside for something.  He probably was killing Japs back in the day, man.  He probably had a hell of a life.  Manly man.  And now he's an old fart frozen in his driveway with his slippers?  Embarrassing PJs.  The slippers are askew.  Probably Mickey Mouse PJs or something.  Thought he was marching to the major's tent for orders.  I've got to see the major.  He's got a mission for me.  And his PJs out in the driveway.  Adult undergarments. 
[03:28:30]  Adult diapers.  He's now just an old fart?  Oh, God.  I've got a good way to discuss the body, too.  Oh.  A mulcher.  A tree mulcher.  Yeah, that doesn't leave any evidence.  A guy tried that once, and he got caught.  That was one of these chippers.  Do we have the speech from Snatch?  The pig?  Snatch.  The pig speech?  Pigs.  We might have it?  That's how they used to get in the body.  But then, you know, where are you? 
[03:29:00]  I might be tough to call.  What are you doing?  Why are the tire tracks up to the pig pen?  What's that?  Like, there's just no way to do it.  What, throw it in there when the pigs eat it?  Bootmarks in the mud dragging.  Yeah.  Oh, I'll get rid of the boots, too.  Why'd you buy these boots?  Look, there's a camera.  There's a picture of you buying the boots.  There's no way to do it.  It just sucks.  You can't get rid of a body anymore.  There's no way to get rid of a body.  And the pig story probably came from the sequel to Silence of the Lambs, because that's how  they were going to kill Hannibal Lecter, was that wild boars eat them or whatever. 
[03:29:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Really.  Yeah, the speech from Snatch was terrific.  Huh?  App.  What?  What?  What?  Sorry, guys.  You guys rock.  Thank you.  What are you trying to say, Michelle?  Michelle.  You guys rock.  Hey, I'm Smurffucker, by the way.  You're what?  Well, I'm Smurffucker.  I'm Smurffucker.  I'm Smurffucker.  Oh, you're Smurffucker.  What does that mean?  I'm just swinging a miss.  I'm sorry.  I was the one that called a couple of people.  What? 
[03:30:00]  I was the one that used to haunt my Smurf.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I vaguely remember you.  You remember?  We could use a lady humping something at this point.  Absolutely.  You want to hump something for us?  Hump the dead guy.  Oh, my God.  Michelle.  You can't just say you're the Smurf.  Hump the frozen calf of the old codger.  All right.  Let's go to Tony in Jersey.  Tony.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Tony.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  I was driving down to Virginia one day. 
[03:30:30]  Hey, I found a car up the side of the road in a ditch where this black lady was there  with her face shot off by a shotgun.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I guess it was said in the paper a couple of days later that it was drug related.  Apparently, she was taking her kid over to testify.  And they just must have drove by, shot her in the face, drove off the road into a ditch  and found her in a ditch.  What happened with the kid?  Pardon?  Kids weren't around.  They didn't say anything in the paper where they were. 
[03:31:00]  It was just her in the ditch.  No one's listening in here.  What are you looking at?  Why?  What's up?  Jimmy's looking.  That's right.  I'm out.  Punching out.  What's going on?  Well, baby girl decided to brush her hair and everything in her panties and bra.  Yeah.  So no one's paying attention to phone calls.  I'm just looking at baby girl.  She just cracked out.  Wishing I was a chair.  That's hysterical.  Now it's just all frozen.  And it froze with her stupid arm right in front of her tits. 
[03:31:30]  Her arm was in downward brush motion in front of her tits and it froze.  That's hysterical.  Guy's talking.  It just sounds like Charlie Brown teacher.  Let me tell her.  I think the other thing was...  No, there was...  Oh, yeah.  So he was saying that there was...  Why are you taking my new bit?  I love that bit.  I don't have many bits.  I'm going to steal that bit so fast.  Let me have that one.  It's so funny.  All right.  Let's go to Nick. 
[03:32:00]  I had no idea that there were so many people out there that have actually seen dead bodies.  I had no idea.  No clue.  I saw...  Did you really?  Yeah.  No, you didn't.  I was awake.  Of course.  Nick in Maine.  What's up?  Hey, Nick.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Listen, when I was growing up, I had a next door neighbor.  She was always sick.  Really fat old lady.  And her husband was the nicest guy.  One night, like in the morning, right after a big snowstorm, she was having chest pains.  So they called us up. 
[03:32:30]  He was cleaning off the car in the driveway.  And he was yelling back and forth to her.  I'll be right there, honey.  Everything will be all right.  Everything will be all right.  And she's screaming at him and stuff.  He drops dead right in front of me of a heart attack.  He did?  Yep.  He dropped dead of a heart attack, getting ready to take her to the hospital.  And then she lived another...  God knows she may be still alive, but she at least lived another 20 years.  Because I know I see her after that years later.  But the lady, just a poor bastard. 
[03:33:00]  She was always a shrewd to him.  And he just dropped dead trying to get her to the hospital.  Wow.  It was crazy.  I'll punch it out, guys.  Bastard.  All right, thanks, bro.  A shrewd.  That's a good word.  A shrewd.  What do you all see, fam?  Be quick.  Be safe.  Okay, we'll take another break.  I've got to take a leak.  I'm going to take a nap.  All right.  You tired today, Jimmy?  Dude, I actually went to bed earlier than normal last night.  And I overslept today. 
[03:33:30]  I actually got up at 5.17, which I get up every day.  5.17, exactly.  And I have a remote control on my alarm, which I have to walk across the room for it.  For the remote?  Yeah.  I don't leave it by my bed because I'll just go back to sleep.  Yeah.  It's a Bose alarm.  It's really loud.  Sometimes I'll reset it for 10 more minutes to sleep until 5.27.  Yeah.  And I just fucked up this morning.  What did you set it for?  I don't remember.  I just did it wrong because it was still lit, indicating that my alarm hadn't gone off yet,  which meant that it went off and I reset it.  Oh, no.  Yeah, I probably just hit it first.  Oh, no.  I might have went backwards with who the fuck knows. 
[03:34:00]  I'm the get the right the fuck up guy.  Like, I set the alarm when I have to get right up.  Yeah.  There's no snoozing.  There's no nothing.  Like, it goes off and I'm like, oh, my God.  I can't even wait like a minute.  So, I got to get right the fuck out of bed because if I lay there for any length of time.  Do you talk to yourself every morning when it goes off?  Oh, yeah.  It's just you mother fucker.  Oh, this fucking shit.  And then I stand up and it's dark in the room and I proceed to just bounce off the walls. 
[03:34:30]  I'm banging off the walls.  Yeah.  Like, I'm so fucked up, still asleep.  I, um, yesterday the alarm goes off at 4.20, whatever it is.  Yeah, dude.  Oh, yeah.  Well, actually, it's about 4.30.  And the first thing I said was, oh, I knew it that time.  Yeah.  Just babble.  I know it.  Because what happens is I'll start waking up and sometimes I'll check the clock and it's 2.30.  I'll go, oh, I got two more hours.  Or I'll wake up and it's like 4.15. 
[03:35:00]  So, I guess it was yesterday.  I woke up just before the alarm and then it goes off and I go, oh, I knew it that time.  I mean, it was going to go off any second.  I knew it.  I like when they go off, uh, when, uh, when, uh, when you wake up and, uh, it's like 1 in  the morning and you think you have to get up and you look at the clock and go, come on,  don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, oh, good.  Oh, I got some time.  And that goes by in a second.  Like in a second you shut your eyes, you back away.  It's kind of like looking at your hand in poker.  Yeah.  Come on, come on. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah.  Shit.  Fucking 4.15.  I'm tired.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Sleepy.  And we'll get the energy back in the room.  Right, Jimmy?  Yeah, it's just these hours are a little hard.  Sweet oral pleasure.  Such a talented little heroin addict.  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, oh.  Oh, dear.  Overdose.  Ramon. 
[03:36:00]  Get the wood chipper.  Come on, do the light behind the shadow.  Then I'll just look at you by the other way.  Come on, do the light behind the shadow.  All right.  Quince in the Bronx.  We're tired.  Bah.  Nah. 
[03:36:30]  Bronx cop here.  Okay.  One morning a man walks in and Stacey killed his wife in Kentucky.  The desk officer rolls his eyes and asks where she is now.  He replies in the front seat of the car.  Uh-oh.  He drove all the way to New York with a dead body.  He probably just wanted to see what it was like to be on the highway without that bitch  nagging him.  He probably played whatever songs he wanted on the radio for fucking two hours.  Which is why he would drive from Kentucky to New York in two hours.  Well, yeah.  Sometimes you've got to think a joke through. 
[03:37:00]  Maybe he was on the superhighway.  Maybe he was driving quickly.  Maybe life is a highway.  Got a pen.  Oh, yeah.  Got a pen.  We're signing like contracts every day.  Eh, you just got to sign it, you know?  You sign something and you get a boatload of money.  I don't know.  That's all I see.  That's the way I see it.  Really?  I don't know.  I'm just signing.  I don't read it.  I have full trust in everybody. 
[03:37:30]  Sign where it says sign.  All righty.  Another contract for another big deal, people.  Is it a big deal?  No.  Are we getting more markets?  When are we getting more markets?  Where does Jim sign?  Actually, one of our markets got sold.  I want to sign.  Where does Jim sign?  Where do I sign?  Nowhere.  But I want to sign.  Oh, jeez.  I want to sign.  I like to sign.  You always sign on the dotted line.  I give it the old John Hancock.  Yeah, the big wazoo guy stole us. 
[03:38:00]  Have that...  I don't sign.  ...filled out in triplicate.  What?  All right.  Big wazoo getting flipped.  Excuse me.  Plebe.  Can I have a plebe in here, please?  Take this paperwork and mail it out.  They're voting for line of the day right now.  What the fuck?  They're voting for line of the day.  Line of the day.  All right, listen.  Line of the day.  Professor gives lecture while obviously stoned.  Yeah, this has been making the rounds.  We could do this before we get out of here today. 
[03:38:30]  You're the guy, huh?  There you go, sir.  Have that...  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  Give me that.  Problem?  Problem?  Yeah, these guys are known for peeking.  He doesn't trust Iraq.  Wow, I gave him an open envelope assuming that Iraq...  Ooh, he's pissed.  Holy shit.  Ooh, the peeker is mad.  Ooh.  Ooh, gander taker is angry.  Did you see that?  He threw the headphones.  He threw the headphones anyway.  Nothing says kill.  Whatever. 
[03:39:00]  Peeping Iraq.  Nothing says guilt like what...  Like that reaction.  That's right.  That reaction.  Thank you.  Like if I had never peeped into one of those things, I would be like, I wouldn't even know  because I kind of didn't know what you meant when you went, wait, wait, give me that.  I thought, oh, does Opie want to send it out or something?  I didn't know you wanted to seal it.  Dude, I was kidding.  I was making a bit.  Yeah.  But with that reaction...  Now we know.  That says it all.  He peeks at all of our contracts.  That says it all.  And they're all nodding their heads.  Holy shit.  Yeah, look, everyone in the room is like, yeah.  Hey, get the peeker in here. 
[03:39:30]  I was just making a little joke.  Wow.  That reaction.  You can't react like that.  They're probably scanned into his computer and mails him out.  I want to know who he is on the message boards.  Iraq's dirty.  I know it.  Iraq's one of the dirty ones.  I found your pictures by using a ghost program.  What?  What?  What?  They all are laughing.  A ghost program?  What?  Huh?  He's a good boy, so I don't want to kill him, but...  Oh, oh.  Iraq, what's the matter?  I was still kidding.  Were you relaxed? 
[03:40:00]  Wow.  That showed a little too...  Yeah.  Thou protesteth too much is what they say.  Why are you so offended, sweetie?  Huh?  What do you want to peep at?  I'll tell you what's going on.  Yeah, what's wrong?  Here you go.  What do you want to peep at?  Steam this open and mail it out.  Yeah.  And don't say you were joking back.  Oh, you lost that part.  No, I didn't say I was joking.  You got mad at that, right?  Yeah.  Why?  I don't know.  Why?  Because I get that a little too much.  I didn't do anything.  Too much?  Was that the first time I've ever seen anyone accuse you of peeping at anything?  Who else accused you of your subconscious?  I've handed you, like, open stuff and things.  No, not you. 
[03:40:30]  Oh, I'm the nice guy.  I forgot.  Not you.  I'm the nice one.  Who?  I forgot.  No, it's just little things like that.  It's like, oh, don't give him this.  Don't take this because he's going to, I don't know, hang it up on his wall somewhere.  He's stealing photos.  I was like, what happened with the photo thing?  Yeah.  Oh, was that?  Was that?  Remember when I lost my camera?  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Did it get found?  Not the camera, but the pictures did?  The pictures did.  Every single picture.  Every single one.  Get out of here.  Something to do with a ghost program. 
[03:41:00]  Howdy.  Yeah.  Eric went boo and copied.  Wait a minute.  I am very curious here, just on a technological.  I'm very appreciative because.  Out of technological curiosity.  If you guys remember the digital camera I had.  I absolutely do.  And I'm still convinced that some savage at the cellar, a place I love to go.  Possible.  Took my camera, my digital camera.  I met up with Jimmy one night after the Wolf Mother show.  Oh, yeah.  And there were some crazy, crazy pictures on there.  I forget all of them now, but yeah, Lindsay with Oprah and some other fine, fine shots. 
[03:41:30]  And I lost the camera and I thought I lost about six months of my life because I'm stupid.  Yeah.  I fill up the card and then I finally go and get them printed.  Uh-huh.  And I lost the camera and I was really bummed because there was a lot of really good pictures on there.  Okay.  So the camera's completely gone.  Now the camera is gone.  Gone.  Did you ever find the camera?  No.  The camera is still gone.  Completely gone.  All right.  Camera, gone.  Gone.  Pictures never copied. 
[03:42:00]  You never downloaded the pictures?  No.  Well, how?  Wait, wait, what?  And then one day, one day, because we talked about this on the air, how bummed out I was.  I'm fascinated by this.  Remember how bummed out I was?  Yes.  I'm trying to remember some of the other really valuable pictures on the camera at the time.  You and the Asian boy?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Thanks, Jimmy.  I was a cute one.  And then, uh...  A trip to Thailand.  Eric, they're forcing me because I think you're a good boy.  You saved my life.  You made me very, very happy.  It's fine.  Like I said, on a technological... 
[03:42:30]  Out of technological curiosity, I want to know how this works.  I was really appreciative.  Mm-hmm.  And I want to make that well-known.  Well, Iraq comes up to me, like, a couple weeks later with a disc and says, uh...  What'd you say?  I can't get these again for you, so don't lose this disc.  Yeah.  And on the disc was all my pictures from my lost camera.  Okay.  That I thought I lost at the comedy show.  All right.  Now, I think I know a lot of things, but there are some things I don't know. 
[03:43:00]  Mm-hmm.  Perhaps you can enlighten me.  Okay.  I want to know how this is done.  Okay, fine.  Sometimes he takes some photos that he wants up on the website, and he had a bunch of them  at one point.  Mm-hmm.  So, while doing other photos and other things, I just took his little memory card, copied  it over, took what he needed, and deleted everything.  Oh, I got it.  Yeah.  Put it up, didn't think another thing.  He then goes to the cellar the following weekend, loses his camera, and he's freaking  out because there's some kind of photos on there that were really important to him. 
[03:43:30]  Mm-hmm.  So, I looked to see if I had anything.  No, they're gone.  But I remember we deleted them.  So, there is a program, when you delete some files, that you can get that stuff back.  As long as it hasn't been overwritten.  Yes.  And this wasn't.  So, I ran the program, got it back, and I said, I don't know if any of these were corrupted  or not, but here's what you have.  And I gave it to him, and you are corrupted.  It corrupted me in a piece that might have been written over.  Yeah.  Or, like, if you go to open the photo, and it's all pixelated, and there's a bunch of  stuff on there.  Yeah, every picture was perfect.  Okay.  And it had been corrupted.  So...  How amazing is that? 
[03:44:00]  So, obviously, all the pictures were put on a portion of your disc that hadn't been  written.  Yeah, it wasn't that long between when that happened and when he lost his camera.  So, obviously, though, you weren't able to get the pictures that were on the camera  that were taken that night.  Right.  Okay.  No, so, whatever I had...  That's where I was thrown.  Whatever we did at the time was what we managed to salvage.  We found that folder, burnt it to a disc, and then we permanently went through and got  everything.  I told him, if you lose this disc...  Ran through the military delete. 
[03:44:30]  Yeah.  If you lose this, we don't have it anymore.  It was a modern-day miracle, I have to tell you.  What's the ghost program called?  The one I think we had was Win Undelete or something like that?  Win Undestall?  It was a modern-day miracle, pictures that I thought were lost.  So, we give him the disc, and he said he's very appreciative of whatever.  We make sure it's gone and done with.  Then I find out he asked Laszlo if there was a program that did this.  Oh!  I was a little paranoid. 
[03:45:00]  I don't know this stuff about you guys.  I also want to know this.  How did you find out he asked Laszlo?  Laszlo told me.  Why is Laszlo ratting you out?  Yeah, why is he ratting me out, Eric?  He said, I had no idea he did.  He said it on his show, the last show he did here.  So, he told me.  It is kind of funny, and he probably would have to say it on the show.  Yeah.  I hope he's asking me.  I had to.  I was a little paranoid.  I'm not going to lie to you.  So, Laszlo filled me in on that end many, many months after the fact that this happened.  In my dumb brain, I'm thinking every time I give him my card. 
[03:45:30]  Is it a memory card?  Yeah, he's making a copy for himself.  So, you don't have to give him the actual camera.  You give him the memory card.  Yeah.  Yeah, the second you hand over that memory card, forget it.  Absolutely.  Every picture is on his computer.  That's right.  Dude, every picture.  Do you ever play Starmer Glockman songs and just kind of watch his pictures go by?  You put him in a slideshow.  Here's a picture when he was almost happy.  Yeah.  Do you ever wake up confused as to who you love more?  You just go, Opie Hulk.  Did you Photoshop Lindsay out and you in to some of the photos with Opie with his arm around you holding your hand? 
[03:46:00]  No, someone on Wackbag already did that for me.  Oh, did they?  Yeah.  There's probably this one photo of Opie smiling either at Lindsay or someone else that you kind of wish he was smiling at you that way.  It's not a gay thing.  It's like just a loving smile.  It's a smile of friendship.  It's a smile of affection.  I bet you it's like this.  I bet Opie you're looking over like this, like to the right.  It's like an over-the-shoulder, really nice, happy moment, a smile. 
[03:46:30]  Dan, what's going on?  I don't know.  Dan, guess.  Jimmy farting.  Oh, Jimmy farting.  Jimmy farting.  So, I was going to take you on today, by the way.  Last night I drank a lot of milk.  I was going to surprise you today.  It didn't work.  I got to go back to the lab and figure out a new formula.  I had a huge thing of grapes and milk, whole milk, thinking that I was going to get the job done  and we were going to have a little gas-off time.  I laughed at milk.  I was going to surprise you.  My formula didn't work.  Oh, here we go. 
[03:47:00]  Lazlo, you got thrown under the bus by E-Rock.  Why is E-Rock throwing me under the bus, man?  He's totally ratting you out, man.  Well, the only reason I brought it up is because E-Rock said he was going to be the producer  of my show and, meanwhile, he invites some buddies and doesn't even sit in the studio with me.  I'm having, like, technical problems, so...  You were not having technical problems.  Yeah, the beer was frozen.  I had a lot of issues going on.  And E-Rock said he was going to help with the show, so I fired one across the bow. 
[03:47:30]  And the look on his face when I brought that up, he said,  Opie was talking to you about the camera?  Shut up.  Oh.  Come on, E-Rock.  What is wrong with you?  Oh, don't yell at Lazlo.  I'm the juggernaut.  Wow.  It is technically possible what he did,  but I find it difficult to believe that the files weren't written over. 
[03:48:00]  Like, no files were even corrupted.  I had every single picture.  Right.  And it's still...  I'm still suspicious, I'm not going to lie to you,  but I'm very happy because it was a modern-day miracle.  E-Rock's a little upset that you're still suspicious.  A little bit.  A little bit.  No, because then part two came after that.  What was part two?  Part two was where I was going through some of the dats in the reels from the archive,  and I came across some other photos that I had no idea what they were. 
[03:48:30]  All right?  They were in this old reel-to-reel.  And then we found out later that they were photos that he didn't want shown.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Okay?  And they were dirty.  He found a picture of...  And I cleaned them up.  He found a picture of Spuds Buckley.  But I had no idea.  He had a picture of Spuds Buckley in his hand.  Wow.  But when I gave that to you, I said,  I found these.  We cleaned them up.  I gave them to you in an envelope outside of the studio.  I said, I don't know what these are.  Here you go.  Weeks later, he then tells me what they are.  I had no idea at the time. 
[03:49:00]  He had Spuds Buckley in his hand.  Why didn't you show up again?  So did you scan them all?  Did you see Spuds Buckley?  Flatbed scan them all.  I told him this.  I said, they were dirty.  We cleaned them up for you, so you had them.  I didn't know what they were.  I was dirty about them.  They were black and white photos in an envelope.  Stuck together.  Had some other crap on it in a reel-to-reel box.  Now he's stretching.  So what tipped you off?  Like, I'm pissed he is.  What bothered him?  Now he's stretching.  Eric, what bothered him?  Was it the loads all over them?  After you rifled through them?  Yeah.  Yeah, you had Spuds Buckley.  You had proof. 
[03:49:30]  Wow.  Lazlo, you coming in Monday?  I'm coming in Monday.  I've got audio of a couple of people on your staff  who are in the exciting new game, Bully,  that comes out on Tuesday.  I'll be away.  I'll be away.  Oh, really?  I'll be away Monday.  I'm flying home from the giveaway.  Can you come in Tuesday, Lazlo?  I can try to switch it to Tuesday, yeah.  Well, we want you in here when Jimmy's back from Cuba.  Well, yeah, because Cuba.  I'm going to Guantanamo.  Going to Cuba.  You want some food.  The military won't fly me back.  I'm on their schedule.  It's annoying, but I can't come back to Monday  because that's when they have the plane coming back. 
[03:50:00]  Lazlo, when can we tell everyone we're in Grand Theft Auto?  Whenever you want.  And just for that, E-Rock,  I've got so much audio of you,  and the character that you play in Vice City Stories  is going to make everybody very happy.  Yeah, like I didn't expect you to bring that in anyway.  Right.  My name is Eric, and I hate blacks and Jews.  Wow.  I don't hate Jews.  Yeah, I don't think we're...  Lazlo.  We'll move it to Tuesday,  but I've also got some great clips  of Steve the Bear acting in the studio. 
[03:50:30]  Video clips?  No, audio clips.  Oh, some of Steve's acting.  You know how much we love Steve's acting.  Wait till you hear the lines.  He's a construction worker.  Lazlo, can you please tell everyone right this second...  Hand me that two-by-four.  I've just put a nail through my hand.  Hand me that two-by-four.  I've just put a nail through my hand.  Can you tell everyone right now  what E-Rock plays in Grand Theft Auto, please?  He's a bit of a... 
[03:51:00]  sort of an 80s gay jogger.  Then you get to bash with your car and your bike.  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  No.  Nothing's wrong.  Just stay in the living room.  I'll handle it.  He's Sir John Gilbad.  Awesome.  I'll see you guys on Tuesday.  Hey, Lazlo.  Hi, man.  Are you officially aboard?  Yes. 
[03:51:30]  Yeah, Lazlo's, like, helping out the channel.  Oh, good.  Nice.  The virus promo that aired on the announcement of the new channel.  That was you?  I did that.  Absolutely.  Hey, Lazlo, who was that girl that was in the studio?  She sounded like Bonnie.  I could not stop.  Me and Kenny were listening to your show, like, the last 20 minutes of it one night on the  way home from the gig, and I thought it was Bonnie.  No, it wasn't Bonnie.  It was some comedian chick that Reed brought in whose name escapes me.  She's funny?  She seemed pretty funny. 
[03:52:00]  Yeah, she seemed pretty funny.  She could roll with the punches.  I mean, any girl that you can look straight in the face and say that you can smell her  cunt from across the room, she totally goes with it.  It's my kind of girl.  Is she pretty?  Yeah, she was pretty cute.  Did you get a little smooch?  No, I didn't get a little smooch.  Smooch.  But I will say that so many O&A listeners downloaded the show from my website that my  bandwidth exceeded yet again.  Nice.  I had to pull it down.  Oh, they love you.  Great.  Lazlo, we'll see you Tuesday, and I think you're going to do a show soon on the channel? 
[03:52:30]  Yeah, man.  All right, cool.  Bye, sweetie.  Bye, guys.  Bye, E-Rock.  Bye, Lazlo.  I want to do more video games for Lazlo.  It's nice seeing that rock star kind of shying away from the controversial games with this  new one, Bully, where some kid in a school just goes crazy and, you know, can kick the  shit out of anyone he pleases and bullies them around.  We'll get some audio.  Not that controversial.  You don't want to mess with the law, son.  Oh.  Yeah? 
[03:53:00]  Does your video game character not know what to do with its hands?  Like, the graphic itself, its hands just kind of hang there.  One's on a gun, one's on a nightstick.  That's all I can imagine.  Oh.  Well, a little spoiler.  I had to adjust my catchphrase for Grand Theft Auto.  Did you?  Oh, yeah.  I'm trying to adjust it.  Huh?  How do I adjust it?  Yeah, instead of, uh, I'm a black ninja fuckface, I went with, I'm a black ninja mother effer. 
[03:53:30]  Oh, okay.  That's slightly different.  You said motherfuckers?  That's good.  I'm not sure.  I think we did it that way, but I don't know if that cut's going to make the game.  And, of course, Steve is the construction worker.  Steve, what did you have to say as a construction worker?  Give us one of your lines.  Yeah.  Just give us one line.  I wish I remembered.  I did about, I did about an hour and a half in Laszlo's studio.  Wow.  The construction worker lines.  It's a, the game is big.  We're all in the game.  Like, he used everybody we know.  I'm not in, I'm not in Grand Theft.  He didn't use you for that one?  Nope.  I'm not in Bully.  I'm not in Bully.  I was featured in Bully. 
[03:54:00]  Fucker.  Sometimes I'll take my little water bottle cap and pretend it's a hat and get big laughs.  Because it looks so small.  All right.  Ooh, two runner-ups today?  We got to do line of the day.  Screw the professor.  Yeah, I like my song.  E-Rock, thank you.  The pad data was terrific.  It said, Eric the Creep.  Bastards.  I had a ghost program.  How is Creep spelled?  K-R-E-A-P.  I-P.  Yeah, K-R-E-A-P.  Oh, boy, Derek's as dumb as they come. 
[03:54:30]  Ghost program.  You're still, oh, I love it.  You're still just like that element of doubt.  All right.  The only thing ghostly is the fact that you're haunting Eric's memory.  Yes.  Have you ever been happy and creeped out at the same time?  Yeah, you were happy to get the pictures back, of course.  Like you wouldn't believe.  But I mean, for the love of God.  And then I'm like, wait a minute.  Wow.  What, what?  Another bomb?  It wasn't even a bomb.  I let a fucking pitch go right down the middle. 
[03:55:00]  I just looked at it.  I was watching the new computer graphic of the crash of the plane there in the city.  Yeah, you know.  Cool.  That was nice.  Like they need to make computer graphics and keep this story alive.  Why do they show New York and then New York?  Because it's New York.  New York.  I didn't look at these.  They're Jets tickets.  Wait, wait.  You didn't look at where he's sitting?  And I have four.  And I was going to invite you.  But now with that attitude, I say go fuck yourself.  Oh.  Jets, uh, Dolphins. 
[03:55:30]  Hmm.  Take Laszlo and Danny.  That would piss them off more than anybody.  All right.  Good seats?  Yeah.  All right.  It's going to be a sports weekend.  Islanders on Saturday and then Jets on Sunday.  What time is the Jets game?  Wow.  I don't know.  Hopefully four o'clock.  Two games.  It's not quite a sports weekend.  4.15.  Perfect.  Let's say if you had a Mets game in there too, it would be a sports weekend.  I'm working on that for next week. 
[03:56:00]  Yeah?  Yeah, Wednesday.  No, I hope it doesn't go to Wednesday.  All right.  We got two runner-ups.  For line of the day.  For line of the day.  Let's just go.  Line of the day.  Let's go runner-up.  First runner-up.  First runner-up.  Thank you, Jimmy.  In front of the post, his son was six.  Tearful son defends pilot Corey.  Not dad's fault.  How old is the kid?  Well, kid, six.  Six.  His fault was it?  The buildings?  Of course it was your dad's fault.  He watches cartoons, so he thinks the building should have gotten up and lifted its dress up 
[03:56:30]  and gone, ooh, and the plane should have gone between its legs and flown out the other  side.  You know how cartoons are and little kids love them.  Wow.  All right, listen.  They don't like you behind the scenes.  No.  No.  Absolutely not.  Yeah, I know.  Because that should be line of the day.  No, no.  That's what Travis said, right?  Travis is sticking up for you.  Of course he is.  Whatever you say, Travis.  Thank you.  I remember that line, and I'm thinking no one's going to beat that today.  He just flashed me his pretty smile, too. 
[03:57:00]  His pearly whites.  Who voted?  That vagina of a fucking beard he's got.  I agree.  So the voting should stay anonymous.  You're confident that there's one better than that?  I think the voting should be anonymous.  Yeah, I agree.  Unless Travis is trying to kiss up.  All right.  Here's the second runner-up as far as line of the day.  I'm kissing up.  Leave me chafed.  He's probably some queer.  He's going to tell you to show up in the park restroom, and there's going to be a ticket  ticket through the glory hall.  You have to put it in your mouth, and ticket juice will shoot in your mouth.  Lift up the skirt line was much better than that, though. 
[03:57:30]  That was just a blowjob joke.  Ticket juice, though.  It's very funny.  It is.  All right.  Line of the day.  Sponsored by Bodogfight.com.  Log on and watch American fighters battle for the right to represent the U.S. in a bout  against the Russians.  It's all on Bodogfight.com, a mixed martial arts tournament, and docu-reality unlike any seen  before.  Vote for line of the week.  Are we doing that today, too?  Yeah.  No.  We've got to go home, too.  No.  They can do it.  It's just...  You don't need to announce it.  I was rather curt of you.  Oh, just tell them to go there?  To shut Opie up like that.  No, no. 
[03:58:00]  No, they'll do it.  No, stupid.  Vote for line of the week at iliketolisten.com.  Opie just got confused.  He didn't know.  He got confused.  You don't need to yell, man.  You don't need to cut him off so curtly.  Opie's like, well, they'll do it.  They'll do it, rich boy.  Just go home to your fancy place.  I don't have a home.  No.  Opie just got confused.  I'm still trying to find a home.  Well, Eric will let you crash on his couch or his face.  Maybe he can crash on his computer. 
[03:58:30]  Just living there like a ghost.  I don't know why all my ghost program jokes are bombing.  I keep getting up to the plate and trying to knock ghost program jokes.  You're still trying to do the ghost program.  I've done nothing but foul them off and maybe a single.  You missed the one I said.  The only thing ghostly about it is that Opie is haunting Eric's mind.  And it's fucking got nothing.  No, it was, it really, it got, better you make a left turn on the east side of Manhattan. 
[03:59:00]  Corey always tells you that, doesn't he?  You got ghost laughs from that joke.  Yeah, boo, boo.  I get big laughs from the replay.  Yeah.  Big laughs.  Big laughs.  Here is line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  The line of the day.  I was even trying to think, I think he stepped in it and tracked it through the house. 
[03:59:30]  But the jar opening is too small.  Peanut butter.  Peanut butter and a dog.  Unless the dog is smiling and you have peanut butter on your face.  It's a good one.  The audio is unbelievable.  We'll get into that next.  You've got your lipstick and my peanut butter.  Okay.  Is that the one?  I still say the, uh.  Team win.  Kind of a, yeah.  I still say the. 
[04:00:00]  It was a team win.  I still say the building lifting the.  Yeah.  Nothing against these fine lines, but the.  Lifting the dress up thing.  They're all worthy mentions, but I said.  I think they might not be old enough, Ant, to understand how funny that is.  Maybe not.  Maybe they don't remember, you know.  That's old school cartoon stuff.  That's kind of old school cartoon.  But on a personal note, personally, you know how an athlete kind of assesses what he does  on a daily basis and people recognize what he does.  And perhaps he thinks he excelled at a certain point of the game and other people think  he excelled at other points. 
[04:00:30]  I think.  That was great today?  I didn't like any of the line of the days that were picked for me today.  I think I had one good one today.  What was it?  I think.  I think the Aurora Boris line.  Wow.  Probably.  That was my.  That was my personal favorite for me.  For myself.  Yes.  For myself.  You got a huge laugh from that.  Hold on.  I thought it was a clever.  I thought it was funny.  I thought it was appropriate.  Timely.  It was just quick. 
[04:01:00]  I thought I was brilliant.  He's going to fart in there.  He's going to teach him a lesson.  Yeah.  Oh.  Look.  They're all scrambling.  Oh, shit.  That's what they get.  That was so funny to watch.  Without any sound.  Jimmy walked into the room.  They're all listening to him.  And then you just see him scramble like a bomb just went off because it did.  Oh.  And he has got.  You got some bad gassers today.  Oh.  I don't know.  What do you think?  That's okay.  But we are not the judges.  We are merely the competitors.  They just don't like you. 
[04:01:30]  What's that?  We have it isolated if you want to.  All right.  Let's listen to that.  Oh.  Let me hear it.  Let me bask in my glory.  I thought the handbag matched her face line was pretty good.  That was funny too.  They don't even acknowledge that I exist though at this point.  Oh.  Shit.  I just like working the judges.  It's like a logical warfare.  It is really.  We're all trying to like vie for position here to gain favor with them for the next round.  It's not good enough that we do a good radio show every day. 
[04:02:00]  We want to be line of the day.  That's all I'm doing is I'm positioning for like Monday.  Right.  So they remember, well, we kind of fucked them over on Friday.  It's like the Oscars.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, you got to work the judges a little bit.  Scorsese's got to win eventually.  Come on.  I got jet tickets.  That's what I say.  Where's the Aurora line?  Oh, here it is.  Take a picture of us.  What was your name, Miss?  Aurora.  Aurora?  All right.  There's a little picture taken happening.  All right. 
[04:02:30]  I guess that's it for today.  You were very nice.  Thank you, Jimmy.  You want to come up and watch the show a little bit?  Yes.  Oh my God.  Yes.  Okay.  All right.  Aurora.  It's like the Northern Lights.  Aurora bore us.  You know what's great about listening to that a second time?  You were just sitting there waiting like a serial killer.  I had to wait.  I did.  You knew.  I knew the second she said her name.  I could feel it.  But I had to wait for the picture to be taken for us to walk in.  I could feel that you were waiting.  You knew you had a great line because you set up your own bit.  Well, did you see the adjustment he made? 
[04:03:00]  He said Aurora.  And he could have just said Aurora, but he goes, you know, the Northern Lights, Aurora  bore.  He like set it up properly.  Thank you.  That was like a, that was the cock of the swing.  He cocked his back and then hooked back and then swung.  I love deconstructing the joke.  It's so obvious.  You were just waiting.  Yeah, I was.  I was a different line.  You're absolutely right.  I was sitting there in wait.  All right, guys.  All right, everybody.  What a bang up week.  Thank you, staff, Opie, Jimmy Norton.  FH Riley's?  Yes, Saturday. 
[04:03:30]  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  My brother's going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'll probably wind up ending up there.  Later on?  Yeah, later on.  That'd be nice.  It's last past standing.  It's just an excuse to get the gang together.  Of course it is.  Get the gang together and get some money into the restaurant from bro.  Oh, yeah.  FH Riley's, 400 New York Avenue in Huntington Village.  We'll be there tomorrow night.  Jimmy, November 10th, Hammerstein Ballroom.  Tickets are on sale.  It's my own headline show.  It's the only thing I'm doing in New York for a while.  And also, going to Cuba.  I'm in San Francisco next week. 
[04:04:00]  I'm looking forward to that, too.  Hard to plug Cuba gigs, though.  Yeah, no, you can't go.  We don't have you around a lot next week.  We lose you Monday.  We lose you Friday.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You're right.  Maybe part of Thursday, I'm starting to think.  No.  I'm flying out late.  No.  I'm not working Thursday because I'm not working Thursday night.  Okay.  I'm only doing Friday, Saturday.  Friday, Saturday.  Friday, Saturday.  Friday.  So I'm going out.  I actually flew late today so I could do the show Friday.  Oh.  But I don't have the game.  Don't worry about the Bermuda.  You're on the killing you.  Don't worry about the Bermuda Triangle.  That's just all crap. 
[04:04:30]  Let's hope so.  Yeah.  Especially on Friday the 13th.  Ba-ba.  Oh, be careful.  Oh.  That pretty girl out there.  It's Friday the 13th.  She stayed the whole thing.  I want to paint my fucking.  Aurora stayed the whole show.  I want to paint my dick like a black cat and rub it across her T-cells.  Bad luck for her.  She'll walk under her legs and see what happens.  Old ladder crotch.  Some paint will spill on her.  She's waving off that pitch. 
[04:05:00]  She said no.  She said no to that.  No?  No, look.  Does she have a boyfriend?  Boyfriend?  Lesbo?  No.  You like girls?  Girls, right?  Yeah.  Lesbo.  Oh, my God.  No, we almost left on time for one.  We were almost out of here.  We got to pull her in and see if she likes girls.  A lesbo?  The door's too heavy for her to push open.  How adorable.  She couldn't be a lesbian.  So, you like girls?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kind of.  Well, I had a boyfriend for two and a half years, but he cheated on me. 
[04:05:30]  Oh, so he pushed you over to the girls' side.  Well...  You went lesbo?  You went the dark side.  No, I might.  I'm thinking of, you know...  You're thinking about joining the other team?  You're thinking about a trade.  Yeah.  You don't really...  I'm having a hard time with guys and not being able to...  Well, you won't be having a hard time if you go to girls'.  There's nothing harder.  There's nothing harder.  No.  That joke was limp.  I would treat you right.  That's why.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Between the strippers and the massage girls... 
[04:06:00]  I hate strippers.  He cheated on me with a stripper, too, so I'm very...  I've never gone to strip clubs ever.  I think strip clubs are...  They're terrible.  I know.  What a waste.  What are you doing?  Yeah, we think strip clubs are for fags.  Yeah.  We really do.  I don't like...  He might...  Yeah, yeah.  I don't like strippers.  Strippers aren't like real girls.  Give me a pic of my nose.  Awful.  You're a contortionist.  We could have a good date together.  We'd go out and have some wine.  I think she's more a gymnast than a contortionist.  Contortionists are like those people that fold themselves up and put themselves in luggage  at circuses.  You're more of a gymnast.  Did you do gymnastics in junior high or something? 
[04:06:30]  A little bit, but I take ballet and I do yoga, so I'm more of a yoga dance.  You're too short for a ballerina.  Exactly.  I can't be right there.  So you should have went with the gymnastics.  Yeah.  You're built for that.  Thank you.  A little?  Someone could fling you around?  I...  All right.  I gotta...  I gotta stop talking.  Why?  You're gonna get yourself in trouble?  I don't know.  No, I'm...  Um...  Just say it.  Oh, man.  It's okay.  No, I don't know.  What?  It's okay. 
[04:07:00]  No, it's not that I'm...  We're just trying to make you nervous.  Is it working?  Yeah, you're making me really, really nervous.  What did I miss?  Nothing.  I don't even remember what I was gonna say.  He was saying I'm built like a gymnast.  You're built like a gymnast.  Well, I can't take a compliment, so that made me all like...  No, that was a compliment.  I know, but I can't...  You're like petite.  You have a nice body.  You have a nice body.  No, I'm not really that petite.  People always think I'm a lot...  I weigh a lot less than I actually do.  I'm pretty solid.  Look, take the compliment.  Don't let us...  You know, you got a gymnast body.  That's pretty solid.  You have a nice rump.  Solid.  Thank you.  You got a nice rump.  Thank you, Jim.  Jimmy's compliments are the best. 
[04:07:30]  You got a nice shitter.  All right.  Well, that's great.  Okay, so she might go over to the girls' team.  Well, good luck with that.  Thank you.  All right.  Bring your bats.  That'd be a fun date.  That'd be a fun date, Jim.  That's a good line.  We go out with coffee.  We go out with hug.  You know...  Bye-bye Aurora.  Yeah, she can't pull the door open.  There's no toilet paper.  Luckily, I'm along.  All right.  I got to go.  See you.  Bye.  Goodbye, listeners. 
[04:08:00]  I'll see you on Tuesday.  Tuesday.  And remember, those of you,  myspace.com,  save Lucky Louie.  Those save things never work, by the way.  Who's coming in on Monday as a comic?  Patrice O'Neill.  Patrice?  Patrice will be here.  All right.  And Vinny Brand.  And Vinny?  Cool.  Very cool.  Vinny was very funny when he was on.  Very good.  Oh, look.  Buffalo, New York resident.  Oh, I wish it was still snowing.  They're showing more snow.  All right.  Take it.  I hope Fat Boy is face down.  I hope he slammed the door. 
[04:08:30]  I wonder if all the other snowmen will look at Bob Kelly  and wonder why is he like a fucking flesh-colored snowman.  How can he walk?  How do that matter?  Why cannot we walk?  Hey, carrot nose.  Wait.  But dude, I'm alive.  Dude.  I broke my carrot stick, dude.  Hold my twig.  All right, guys.  All right, kids.  We'll see you Monday.  Me and Opie and Patrice and Vinny.  And Jimmy, you have a safe trip.  Look how cute I look with my hood tied. 
[04:09:00]  Like the Unabomber.  Oh.  Better not to go to the airport like that.  But have a safe trip.  And we will see you Tuesday.  And for everybody else, we will see you bright and early.  Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.  If I'm not killed in a plane crash.  On Monday.  No, God forbid.  I am saying God forbid.  And I'm knocking wood.  There we go.  That'll cure everything.  All right.  And we'll see you Monday.  Take it easy.  Hi.  I love listening to Opie and Anthony when I'm having a tubby. 
[04:09:30]  I get clean.  I laugh at the funny jokes.  And I play with my submarines.  Sometimes Uncle Henry gets in the tub with me.  He makes me play with his submarine.  Opie and Anthony!  I'm a happy play.  Line of the Day is brought to you by Bodog.  If you want to vote for Line of the Week, go to iliketolisten.com.  Hey, what's up?  It's Louis Twitchell's Santani.  Shut the fuck up!  Tourette's Day is coming to the Opie and Anthony show.  Which is to say that we've discovered a new excuse to point and laugh at people who are different. 
[04:10:00]  To help us understand a little bit more about Tourette's, we've enlisted the help of hearing-impaired Chicago reporter Karen Meyer.  Tourette's syndrome is a new radical disorder that's characterized by involuntary thick and repeated vocalization.  Exactly.  So if you have Tourette's or if you know somebody with Tourette's, muster up some courage and an ounce of self-control and get in touch with the Opie and Anthony show.
