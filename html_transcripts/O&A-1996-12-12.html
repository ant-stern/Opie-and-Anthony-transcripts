<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a recap of their previous night's "halftime show," where Hope and her girlfriend performed a raunchy act involving breast and buttock exposure, culminating in a kiss, resulting in the hosts being pelted with beer and ice.  Hope's appearance was heavily promoted for an upcoming episode of their "Real Rock TV" show.  A major segment focused on a giveaway: a weekend ski trip to Sunday River, Maine, including condo and ski passes, with on-air contests including a drive-thru Christmas carol challenge. The runaway popularity of Tickle Me Elmo was discussed, highlighting news stories of fights over the toy and brainstorming ideas for a destructive Elmo-related stunt on their TV show.  A caller’s recording of their daughter's Elmo doll saying "F me" was played and discussed. Producer Ian Barrett called in, promoting the upcoming "Real Rock TV" show, emphasizing its racy content, specifically the inclusion of footage from the "Boobart" (the halftime show) segment.

Guest Arthur Gray from a Westboro, MA public access television show visited the studio to promote his upcoming interview. The hosts also promoted their station's compilation CD, "Unusual Suspects." A pre-recorded phone call with Tina Louise (Ginger from Gilligan's Island) was played, during which an inappropriate question was asked.  Graphic details of a breast reduction surgery shown on the Learning Channel were discussed at length.  A commercial break featured a heavy promotion of Jenna Jameson's appearances at Matthews, an adult entertainment club in Kingsborough, emphasizing her attractiveness and multiple daily appearances. The commercial included the club's location and contact information.  The broadcast concluded by again promoting the ski trip giveaway, discussing plans for a future "halftime show," and reiterating details about the upcoming "Real Rock TV" show and its time change.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Very good.  And we outdid ourselves last night, huh, brother man?  We had our little Opie and Anthony halftime show there.  It's kind of getting bad because now when you and I go on stage, people are expecting us to do something wacky.  So last night we treated the thousand plus people to one of the girls that we had in here for Boobart.  Yes, Hope.  Hope. She went on stage.  Yeah.  She showed her cans.  Oh my God.  When we first brought her out, said, this is the girl, Hope, that we had down at the studio.  She did Boobart and the crowd's like, ah, they went crazy. 
[00:00:30]  And then you said, watch this.  Right.  And she lifts her shirt up to reveal those, I mean, extraordinary boobs.  I'll put the challenge out.  The most perfect boobs in Boston.  I would say, yes.  Okay.  I'll agree.  I'm not even going to say size or anything.  Just in general, the most perfect boobs I've ever seen in my life.  I mean, the crowd was loud.  Right.  And then when she did that, I didn't think they could get any louder.  It was like, ah, ah.  Right.  Well, then I go, well, now say hi to Hope's real girlfriend. 
[00:01:00]  And then her girlfriend comes walking out.  Right.  On stage.  Yeah.  Not to be done up.  She shows one of the most extraordinary behinds I've ever seen in my life.  Yes.  She bent over, did that little closed leg booby bar dancer bend over, you know, right before  they do that slap on their ass.  And she pulled her pants down.  She had a little G-string on it.  Right, right, right.  And wow.  So then the place goes crazy for that.  And I go, oh, don't worry.  Everyone, it gets better than that. 
[00:01:30]  Do you want to see these girls make out?  And they start sucking face on stage.  They started going at it, groping.  It was, uh.  And then that's where we got, that's when we got hit with the beer and ice.  Someone started throwing ice up on stage.  Ice and beer.  There was so much fluid, you know, falling on the stage, man.  It was great.  It was awesome.  And, uh, Hope is going to be on this Saturday's Real Rock TV show.  Yeah, we have the boob art that we did in the studio.  Yes, it's going to be on this weekend's show on WUNI.  But you've got to remember, this weekend it's on at 12.30, not 12. 
[00:02:00]  12.30, 12.30, 12.30, 12.30.  Ramones, AM.  Amherst and Ozone gave away some fine tickets to see the Smashing Pumpkins as part of Ticket Blitz Thursday today.  That's right, it is Ticket Blitz Thursday.  Look at me.  Dude, we've got some really good stuff to give away on our show.  What am we got?  We're giving away a whole weekend trip to Sunday River to go skiing.  Stop it.  We're giving away the condo, the ski passes.  Are you kidding me?  No, and we're all going to be up there partying, man. 
[00:02:30]  The party continues this weekend at Sunday River in Maine, and we're going to give those away before 4 o'clock, so stay right where you are.  That's like major prize.  It's literally a $300 prize at least, if not more.  At least.  Wow.  So you get the condo, you get the skiing, you get the party.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  Neat.  Stick around for your chance to win.  And everyone seems to be starting to talk about this Tickle Me Elmo.  People are calling up.  There are lunatics in the stores trying to get their hands on this Tickle Me Elmo. 
[00:03:00]  Well, I was telling you about the footage I saw yesterday on the news where this store in the middle of the Midwest opened up their doors and told everyone there were three Tickle Me Elmos left in this store.  And all these fat housewives from the Midwest were, like, tackling each other, trying to get the last damn Tickle Me Elmo in the store.  It's a fight.  Every five years or so, they come out with a new huge toy.  Right.  And they had the Cabbage Patch craze a while ago, and then the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle merchandise was huge.  Now it's this little red Tickle Me Elmo doll that people are going crazy for. 
[00:03:30]  They produce those things at a rate of $10,000 a week, and they can't keep them stocked.  And they make them in China.  Well, what I want to do.  Well, they call it Ermo.  Ermo.  Tickle Me Ermo.  What I want to do for the Real Rock TV show, I want to, like, duct tape a Tickle Me Elmo to my body.  Right.  And then announce that we're going to be giving it away, like, in the middle of a mall somewhere.  Yeah.  And then just let everyone ravish us to try to get the Tickle Me Elmo off our bodies.  Put it down your pants. 
[00:04:00]  Or you had a good idea.  Make it into a piñata.  Yeah, I'd say we get a pulley and a rope and put the Tickle Me Elmo on the end of the rope.  Right.  And then hold it just out of range of the big, fat housewives trying to get up with their kids.  And let them try to jump.  And then pull it up a little bit.  I think that would be great.  That would be hysterical.  Give me the Tickle Me Elmo doll.  Right.  Or we should just announce that there's a Tickle Me Elmo in some library somewhere and you've got to find it.  Pardon me.  I've got to rip this apart.  It's for my daughter. 
[00:04:30]  We should come up with something, though.  That tickles.  We should, like, walk through the mall with a Tickle Me Elmo, you know, on our stomachs or something.  Duct-taped us.  I think that'd be hysterical.  Yeah.  We'll think about it, right?  Might get assaulted.  That's okay.  Yeah, it's always fun.  All right.  Hey, give us a fax.  931-1073.  And stick around for your chance to win a ski weekend at Sunday River in May.  That tickles.  Obscene, what we're giving away. 
[00:05:00]  I can't believe we're not even making them work for this first set.  Yeah, I know.  All right.  This is going to be the freebie.  Then we're going to make you work for it for the rest of the show, okay?  And hard.  And hard.  Wait a minute.  Look at everyone jumping with a gun, man.  That's not fair.  We could take care of that.  Poof.  Uh-huh.  All right.  I just zapped the phones.  They're busy right now because I want to get through this, okay?  Yeah.  We got a ski weekend at Sunday River this weekend, Friday through Sunday.  It includes ski passes and accommodations for two.  This is like a vacation. 
[00:05:30]  Big time.  You take your girl to this, boy.  You're scoring.  If you can't score bringing your chick to this, forget about it.  Up in a condo, hanging, man, you know, drinking a few hot toddies before you know it.  Bam, the panties are off.  Plus, we got the whole WAF gang going.  We're all leaving here after the show tomorrow.  So, yes.  If you want to go skiing with us, it's Sunday River all weekend long in Maine.  You got to be able to leave either tomorrow or very early Saturday.  Yeah.  Don't punk out.  Don't punk out.  All right.  We got Brian working the phones.  Is there an age limit on this one, man?  I would think there should be. 
[00:06:00]  Must be blank to win.  No, I don't think there's an age limit.  All right.  Fascinating.  Well, if you're like 12 or 13, you're going to have to bring a parent, obviously.  We got Brian working the phones.  He'll simply take the seventh call right now at 931-1AF.  Take care of Brian.  And he's a real cool dude, by the way.  All right.  Hey, quickly, I want to replay the mall chicks from yesterday.  That was cool with the peanut butter.  Yeah.  Explain that real fast.  Well, we sent our buddy Carpenter Bob out to a mall.  And he had a thing of peanut butter and some spoons. 
[00:06:30]  And he found some girls that were willing to fill their mouth up with peanut butter and sing Christmas carols.  Right.  But we made him say a couple of other things with their mouth full, too, just for fun.  Check it out.  Carpenter Bob.  Hey, what's going on?  What are you doing, man?  Where are you?  I'm down at Charlie's Saloon in the Greendale Mall in Worcester.  Oh, cool.  And we got two girls here that are going to sing some Christmas carols for you.  Are we going to do the peanut butter trick?  You got it.  They're going to gargle peanut butter and sing.  You guys can sing.  Jingle bells.  Jingle bells.  Jingle bells.  Cool.  We got Holly and Nikki, so I'll put them on the line. 
[00:07:00]  Here's Nikki.  Opie and Anthony.  Nikki.  What's happening?  What's up?  Going to be doing some caroling with the peanut butter in your mouth?  Yes, we're going to sing for you.  I love when girls have that full mouth sound.  Do you?  I got peanut butter in my mouth now.  You certainly do.  Can you say, repeat something?  Sure.  Okay.  Say, oh, Anthony, you're so big.  Oh, Anthony, you're so big. 
[00:07:30]  Nikki, repeat after me.  Okay.  Oh, Opie, I don't think I can take any more red.  Oh, Anthony.  I don't think I can take any more red.  All right, we've heard it now. 
[00:08:00]  All right, repeat after me.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It is so huge.  I'm going to choke.  Oh, my God.  It is so huge.  I am going to choke.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, did it work or what? 
[00:08:30]  It worked like a charm, man.  Good job.  What a cheap thrill for us today.  You like that, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Cool.  We'll talk to you soon, all right?  All right, guys.  We'll see you in a little bit.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Stone Temple Pilots.  This is Opie and Anthony.  Thanks for checking us out today.  Definitely appreciate that.  It's Ticket Blitz Thursday, and we're giving away a fine, fine prize.  We have the best prize of the day, I would say.  I would have to say so, too.  We got skiing for you and a pal or you and your girl or you and your dude to Sunday River.  Full accommodations, ski passes, and it's a weekend trip, and we're all going up there 
[00:09:00]  after tomorrow's show.  You can hang out and party with us.  You can join us.  And we're going to have to make people work for these prizes today, man.  Yeah.  I mean, we just gave away a freebie, but we got to make you work for it just a little  bit today.  That's right.  So I'm thinking drive-thru fun today.  Drive-thru fun.  Drive-thru fun.  You got a cellular phone.  You're in your car.  Get to a drive-thru and give us a call right now at 931-1AF.  We'll make you do some goofy things at the drive-thru.  All right?  Always fun.  All right.  Cool.  On the phone, we got Ian Barrett, the producer of the WAF Real Rock TV show. 
[00:09:30]  A lot of controversy about this week's show because we're attempting to get Boobart on  the air this week.  This has to go through their standards.  Right.  It's a very racy show this week.  So let's talk to Ian and see what's going on.  Ian!  Oh, my God.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  I hear you just did the final edit for the TV show this week, man.  Yes, I'm actually staring at Jasmine right now.  Oh, one of the girls from Boobart.  She's applying some pink pastel to the top of her right boob. 
[00:10:00]  And it's on freeze frame.  So is this show going to make it through the sensors and stuff?  I took about four hours to edit like two minutes of Boobart thing because I was like  going frame by frame to make sure that we didn't do anything wrong.  Getting the maximum allowable boob.  It's very nasty.  So what do you think?  Is this show going to be hot or what?  Dude, I think this is our best show ever.  We've given them everything we could give them.  And if you miss this show, they'll be sorry. 
[00:10:30]  All right.  So we definitely have Boobart on for Saturday night, 1230, by the way.  Don't forget, people, it's being preempted because of El Boxio.  So the show will be on at 1230.  We've got Boobart.  What else we've got this week?  We've got a film I did when I was in college called Big Gorilla.  And I actually am in it.  So it's very embarrassing for me.  So this is good blackmail material.  After my disco appearance last week, I'm ready for somebody else to be embarrassed.  All right.  Well, I'm commiserating with you then.  And then we've got Kicking Harold doing Kill You. 
[00:11:00]  And then we also have Helmet just smashing out Unsung.  Man, it's an awesome song.  So I'm really pumped.  This is the best show ever.  If you missed this one, you're just going to be sad.  Wow.  Ian's going out on a limb to say that.  Best show ever.  All right.  Cool.  All right, guys.  We'll all be checking out Real Rock TV this Saturday night.  Remember, 1230, 1230, 1230 on WUNI, man.  Thanks a lot, E.  Bye.  We rock down with Hendrix. 
[00:11:30]  Angel.  On 107.3 WAF.  I want you to join us, you and a guest.  You got accommodations and skiing for two days.  What we need you to do, because we want you to work for these today,  you got to get your ass to a fast food drive-thru window.  Yeah.  So basically, you need a cell phone in your car right now.  And we're going to make you mess with the drive-thru people a little bit.  And this is good.  They can't set it up beforehand because they don't know what we're going to want them to do yet. 
[00:12:00]  Exactly.  We'll tell you exactly what we want you to do next.  So stay right there.  I think the Crank 2-0 is taking care of me today once again.  We had the three-day holiday rage.  It was a three-day party.  I have not been the same the past three days.  No.  I have been very sluggish, and I apologize for that, but I was out very late having a very  good time at the Roxy.  Yes.  Last night was just unbelievable.  Corrosion of Conformity had the best set of the three days.  I mean, all the bands definitely performed and had great sets, but COC was so loud.  They were rocking. 
[00:12:30]  Like Anthony mentioned earlier, it was really cool to see, you know, skull and crossbones  on the stage again.  The skulls with horns coming out of them, wicked light show, you know, like the old days.  Lots of guitars.  The mosh pit was insane.  It was cool.  I got abused because people said, you know, you and Ant, you talk ass on the radio all  the time.  Why don't you join us in the mosh pit for a few songs?  I'll admit on the radio right now, I'm a wimp, man.  That mosh pit last night was completely out of control.  Getting in the mosh pit? 
[00:13:00]  There were people throwing just full-fledged elbows into faces last night.  I realize the people that go in the mosh pit, really, I guess, you have to have some  kind of mental problem.  I'm sorry.  But I can't see how you could get in there with elbows, arms, fists, legs swinging and  think it's cool.  I just think it's a sign of getting older, that's all.  Because, I mean, I'll still do some crowd surfing, no problem.  Yeah.  But I used to like going in the mosh pit and getting a couple elbows to the head.  But I'm getting a little older and I'm starting to realize that, you know, getting an elbow 
[00:13:30]  to the nose is just not fun anymore.  It's not my idea of a good night.  No.  I mean, I'll still crowd surf, but there's people just getting blindsided.  You don't even know it's coming.  Well, you saw blood in the bathroom, which means it was definitely a good time last night.  There was a guy coming out with his eye just dripping blood.  Yeah.  And he's like, rock!  Yeah, man!  Cool!  I don't know about you, but my idea of a good time is not leaving the club needing stitches.  No.  Or any kind of medical attention.  No.  But we got to say hi to everyone we met last night. 
[00:14:00]  It was a great, great time.  And say hi to everyone that joined us for the three-day holiday rage, because we raised  lots and lots of money for Brightside Living, which is a great, great organization.  So, all right?  Yes, Zach.  All right, we got to give away a ski trip or two to Sunday River, Maine.  Gotta.  It is Tickle Bliss Thursday, after all.  We're looking for someone with a cell phone that is near a fast food drive-thru, and I think  Brian has told me that we got someone on the line here.  Cool.  All right, well, we're going to have them do, because now it's too late for them to try to set  it up.  Right.  They're going to be at the drive-thru, okay? 
[00:14:30]  They're going to have to scream into the drive-thru window, deck the halls with bowels of holly.  Right.  Now, if the person on the other end of the speaker says, ba-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, we'll  give this person a ski trip to me.  Their fate rests in the hands of the person behind the mic.  That's all it is.  Wow.  Nice and simple.  Let's go to the phone.  AF.  Hi, I want to win those tickets for the Sunday River thing.  Well, are you in your car?  Yes, I am.  Are you near a fast food drive-thru?  Yes, I am.  Where are you?  I'm in Auburn.  Okay. 
[00:15:00]  Okay.  At a Burger King?  At a Burger King.  Yes, I am.  How close are you to the drive-thru?  About 10 feet away.  10 feet away?  10 feet away.  This is what I want you to do.  All right.  You got to stick the phone out the window so we can hear you.  Okay.  And so we can hear the lady talking to you, all right?  All right.  We want you, when she goes, hello, welcome to Burger King, can I take your order?  Uh-huh.  We want you to scream on the top of your lungs, deck the halls with boughs of holly.  Do I have to say fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la?  No.  If they say fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, I will give you the ski pass. 
[00:15:30]  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  Deck the halls with boughs of holly.  La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.  Yeah!  Wow, that was way too easy.  Wow.  She said it.  I know she did.  You're going skiing with us to Sunday River in Maine.  All right.  Woo!  Are you?  You got a weekend trip for you and a guest.  Seriously?  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on the line.  Thank you.  Hello? 
[00:16:00]  Hi, Nicole.  Hi.  It's Opie and Anthony.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  Well, whenever you're ready, let Carpenter Bob feed you some peanut butter.  A big load.  He just has a big load.  All right.  Repeat after me.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, my God.  I think I'm going to choke.  Oh, my God.  I think I'm going to choke.  All right.  Say, ouch.  I think I bruised my tonsils.  Ouch.  I think I bruised my tonsils.  All right.  Repeat after me. 
[00:16:30]  Mm-hmm.  Is that all you got for me?  Is that all you got for me?  All right.  How about this?  I never spit.  I never spit.  How about this one?  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  Look at that thing.  Wow.  Look at that.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, God.  I got one for you.  Mm.  It's just like an ice cream cone.  Mm.  It's just me. 
[00:17:00]  All right.  One more.  One more.  Go.  Mm-mm.  It tastes good.  Mm-mm.  It tastes good.  Mm-mm.  Mm-mm.  All right.  You want to sing a Christmas carol for us?  All right.  Wait.  One more.  One more.  All right.  All right.  Who's next?  All right.  Who's next?  All right.  Let's hear a Christmas carol.  I love this gag. 
[00:17:30]  And if you ever saw it, don't even say it blows.  It blows?  What?  It glows.  Glows.  Whatever, man.  Hell no.  Well, you did a great job.  All right.  I need to spit this out.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Spit it out.  Clear.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  He's going to puke.  Hey, guys. 
[00:18:00]  That was awesome.  That was the best.  All right.  You're smoking, too.  You guys are going to love this.  Thanks a lot, Calvin.  All right, guys.  I'll talk to you later.  Bye-bye.  See you.  Bye-bye.  Oh, that is way too funny.  Hey, it's time for the Get Your Ass Off the Couch and Go Do Something Report.  Here's my buddy, Jack Doc.  Thank you, bop, bop.  And you know the Get Your Ass Off the Couch Report is brought to you by the Worcester Centrum Center.  Nice.  Hey, UMass Basketball versus Maryland at the Centrum, February 15th on sale this Saturday  at 10 a.m. in person at the Centrum Box Office.  They're called Tiki Master.  Okay? 
[00:18:30]  Tonight, come on.  The place to be.  It's the Roxy.  C.O.C., another society, handsome.  They're going to rock.  Another society was in here before.  Cool guys.  Very cool guys.  And their music rocks.  I'm looking forward to drinking with those boys in a little while.  Yeah.  If you're unlucky enough to get there and they're sold out, oops, go to T.T. the Bears.  See the Mighty Mighty Boss Tones.  They're playing there.  They're cool.  Stallone, daylight in the movies.  Sleeper.  Good night, Bruce.  Good night, Bruce.  It's our big boss, Bruce Mittman, checking in. 
[00:19:00]  You know what's on TV tonight?  All right, Kathy Lee, just in time for Christmas.  I'm going to poke myself in the eye.  That's what I'd rather do, man.  How does this woman rate a TV show?  It's like in prime time, Kathy Lee Gifford performs with the Oklahoma City Philharmonic Orchestra.  Oh, that's got to be great.  Husband Frank and children Cassidy and Cody are on hand for the family special.  Please. 
[00:19:30]  It's also got Amy Grant, Brian White, whoever that is, and an opera star.  I can't wait.  Who would sit and watch that?  I have no idea.  Or with a little snotty kid.  Obviously, like people that listen to The Eagle, you know.  Yeah.  Hey, Kathy Lee.  Kathy Lee.  We're going to check her out on the tube tonight.  That's got to be fun.  And the Celtics with fleets and a flame.  Tarana.  Tarana.  Tarana.  All right, brother, man.  Hey, let's ride down with Ozzy.  Let's do that.  Yeah.  107.3 WAF, the only station that really rocks. 
[00:20:00]  That's Stir and looking for a WAF exclusive.  And you got a chance to see Stir live.  They're playing Bill's Bar on Lansdowne Street this Saturday.  And we're doing something cool for this show.  It's a write-your-own-ticket show.  Oh, I remember one of these.  Yeah, basically, you just show up at the club with WAF written on a piece of paper.  You show the doorman, and you're in free, man.  Cool.  To see Stir Saturday at Bill's Bar.  I think it's going to be pretty packed, so I would get there early with your little piece of paper with WAF written on it, right? 
[00:20:30]  How could you not get into that show?  You're like, A-W-F.  Yeah, we'll get it easy for you.  Now, we need our faithful listeners to help us out.  We need a Tickle Me Elmo.  You're asking too much.  And I know a lot of radio stations and DJs have been on the Tickle Me Elmo kick, and they're asking their listeners to send in the Tickle Me Elmo, and they're like, what, auctioning it off for charity and stuff?  Yeah.  Screw that.  We want a Tickle Me Elmo because we're going to do a bit for the TV show. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  Where we basically are just going to destroy the Tickle Me Elmo.  Well, I think it'll almost be like the Tickle Me Elmo tolerance test.  Yes.  See what kind of abuse Tickle Me Elmo can take.  And if you give us a Tickle Me Elmo, I'm sure we could give you something.  Concert tickets, CDs, we'll find something for you.  Something worth the exchange.  Because we're going to film it for the TV show.  Like, we're going to have bungee cord Tickle Me Elmo, and we're going to launch him from the building, but unfortunately the rope's going to break.  How about Chernobyl Me Elmo, where we put him in the microwave?  That sounds really good. 
[00:21:30]  We'll put him in for, what, three or four minutes, you think?  Yeah.  We'll do the trick?  Okay.  Let's see if he laughs then.  We want to do drive-by Tickle Me Elmo.  Wow.  We're going to have ski masks on, and we're going to take some shots at Tickle Me Elmo.  We're going to have roadkill Tickle Me Elmo.  We're going to run him over with an 18-wheel truck.  Nice.  And we're going to film the whole damn thing for the TV show, because I'm so sick of everyone talking about this stupid doll.  So if you could help the claws, we would truly appreciate it.  That tickles you. 
[00:22:00]  Bless me, Elmo.  Full body search Elmo.  Yes, very good.  So we want, you know, to make this happen.  And if you have other suggestions, what we could do with a Tickle Me Elmo, you know, feel free to give us a call and give us your suggestions.  So far, we've got the microwave.  The running over by the car, the drive-by shooting.  Maybe we could get some kind of steamroller would be really cool.  That would be good.  All right.  So give us a call, 931-1AF.  Last summer, there was a picture of Marlon Brando in Penthouse giving nah-nah to another guy. 
[00:22:30]  Oral favors.  Oral favors to another guy.  And that other guy, supposedly, was Wally Cox.  Wally Cox.  Who was Marlon Brando's roommate.  Yeah.  And Wally Cox was the voice of Underdog.  Underdog.  Can you believe that?  So, check this out.  Hi, AF.  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  Who's this?  Hey, this is John.  I'm calling from Little Brown and Company in Waltham.  Uh-huh.  And you guys did a bit a couple of weeks ago about Wally Cox and Marlon Brando.  Uh-oh.  And I just wanted you guys to do that one again.  That was so funny. 
[00:23:00]  You know the story, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Wally and Marlon were roommates in the 50s or something.  And somebody snapped a picture of Marlon doing something that the Godfather shouldn't do.  Exactly.  And by the way, that picture is in Penthouse.  Oh, yeah.  This month.  And Wally Cox was the voice of Underdog.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you guys are great.  Underdog.  Underdog, come here.  I want to satisfy you.  Here, let me kneel down in front of you.  Mild-mannered shoeshine boy. 
[00:23:30]  Here, let me buff something for you.  You'll clean my shoes.  I'll buff something for you.  When Marlon kneels, I am not slow.  He opens his mouth and away I go.  All right.  You guys go.  All right.  I'll make you forget sweet Polly Pure Bread.  107.3 WAF. 
[00:24:00]  The only station that really rocks orange 9mm and failure.  It's Opie and Anthony, and we've got a little guest in the studio, Ann.  Why don't you do the honors here?  Go ahead and introduce yourself.  Hi.  Introduce myself?  Yeah, go ahead.  Arthur Gray from the Arthur Gray Show.  The Arthur Gray Show.  The Arthur Gray Show.  Now, that's a public access show in Westboro, Mass.  Yep.  And he decided for some weird reason that he wanted us on his little TV show.  That's cool.  So they came in here to film, and he wanted to say hi to all his pals on the radio today.  That's right. 
[00:24:30]  I didn't believe I'd come down here.  They didn't believe you, right?  They didn't believe me.  He said, dudes, I'm going to interview Opie and Anthony for my TV show.  And they said, yeah, right.  That's right.  Yep.  Wow.  And you know something?  The Arthur Gray Show has equipment that's 10 times better than WAF's Real Rock Television.  He's got network TV cameras in here, it looks like.  Yeah, maybe our GM should get a hand here, man.  My goodness.  They got a two-camera shoot happening in here.  What do we got, a palm quarter?  You know?  That's what we're taping our show with.  Wow.  So when is this show going to be on in the Westboro area? 
[00:25:00]  It's going to be on Thanksgiving special.  Thanksgiving special.  Yep.  Eight o'clock.  What day?  On Thursday?  It's a Wednesday.  Wednesday?  Wednesday.  No, it's a Thursday.  Thursday.  Thursday.  On actually Thanksgiving.  So after you eat turkey, you can watch Anthony and I on this TV show.  Great.  All right.  Very well.  Arthur Gray Show.  That's cool.  I like how you just got your name and there's the title of the show.  You didn't want to call it something else, like at home or, you know, kicking back.  It's, damn it, I'm Arthur Gray and it's my show. 
[00:25:30]  You've got to love that.  That's good.  You'll make a good national anchor.  Good enough for me.  Yeah.  Good enough for Letterman.  Good enough for me.  I like his attitude.  Well, Arthur, thanks for coming in today, all right?  Thanks a lot.  All right.  And on the radio, we got Cake in just a few minutes.  Stay there.  It's here, WAAF's very first station scene, Unusual Suspects.  How funny, man.  It's that and more, a collection of exclusive in-studio performances from Goo Goo Dolls.  Now I won't tell no way or name. 
[00:26:00]  The Nixons.  Sister, I see you.  Dishwalla.  Tell me all your thoughts I've got.  And lots more.  Yeah!  Plus favorite on-air moments.  From the Hillman Morning Show.  Well, Arnold, I had no idea that...  That is Mr. Schwarzenegger.  Moby and Anthony.  I have a Tourette's.  Mm-hmm.  I hate you!  John Osterland.  You will all be bad if that you're done!  And Rocco.  Dude, you stuck your tongue down a dude's throat! 
[00:26:30]  Dude, no, man, wait.  WAAF's Unusual Suspects.  See, Dish, sure to be a collector's item.  Get it at Strawberries, Sam Goody, and Coconuts.  Proceeds benefit the greater Boston food banks.  WAAF's very first station CD, Unusual Suspects.  It's round.  It's got a hole in the middle, so buy it.  Had that horn there with the mute thing.  It was pretty cool.  And you can check it out live Saturday night on the TV show.  Rock!  It's Opie and Anthony.  One of the things we want to do on the show today is play some of the cuts off the Unusual 
[00:27:00]  Suspects CD, the WAF CD.  We never thought we'd see the day.  I'm kind of proud today, to be totally honest with you.  This is great.  We've been working on this thing in secrecy for the last, what, four or five months.  It's like the Manhattan Project with the H-bomb, the secrecy that this thing was veiled in.  Because we didn't want any of the other douchebag radio stations jumping on our bandwagon.  That's right.  So we were able to sneak it out in time for Christmas.  It's pretty wacky, Unusual Suspects.  It has all the jocks here at AAF on the cover in a police lineup. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  And if you don't know what the CD's about, mostly it's a lot of live performances done  right here in the AAF studios.  Like the Beth Hart band, the Goo Goo Dolls, the Shwala, the Nixons, Brother Kane, God Lives  Underwater, and the list goes on and on and on.  And then in between the live performances is some of the classic bits from all the DJs  here at AAF.  Wacky.  Which is going to make a fine Christmas present for somebody.  Yes.  So I wanted to play one of our contributions to the CD, man.  Which one? 
[00:28:00]  Oh, bike.  Actually, this starts off the CD.  Really?  Yeah.  Our famous Tina Louise call.  Oh, she didn't like when we called her.  No, this is Ginger from Gilligan's Island.  If you've never heard this, well, you could check it out.  You could check it out on the CD or right now on the radio.  Check this out.  What a snob.  Yeah, she was a snob, as you will see.  Hello?  Tina?  Yeah.  Tina Louise, how are you?  It's Opie and Anthony from WAF in Boston.  And you are live on the air.  Well, that's very nice.  I'm just on my way out, and I don't really want to be called in my home. 
[00:28:30]  Oh.  We just want to ask you one lovely question.  Yeah, just one question.  You're a legend.  You're Ginger from Gilligan's Island, for God's sakes.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe this.  How about if we ask just one question?  That's it.  You always seem so sweet on TV.  She was always the nicest one on Gilligan's Island.  And the nicest looking.  Nicest looking.  Ginger.  Very sweet.  Could you just indulge us to, you know, just answer one little question, Ginger, please?  One quick question, and we'll never bother you again. 
[00:29:00]  What is that?  When was the last time you got laid?  That's it.  So there you go.  One of the tracks from Unusual Suspects, the WAF CD, which is in your record store as we speak, man.  No wonder she's a recluse.  Yeah, we'll play more tracks from this baby as the afternoon goes on.  AAF with Hendricks.  107.3 WAF Rush. 
[00:29:30]  Test for Echo on the only station.  And that really rocks.  One of the many bands coming to the area in the coming couple of months.  Yeah, a lot of shows coming up.  We got Russian Concerts, Soundgarden, The Black Crow, Smashing Pumpkins, Korn.  SDP.  SDP, that's right.  Tickets go on sale for SDP this coming Saturday.  A lot of people ask it about that.  It's Opie and Anthony.  A lot of people want to talk about the Learning Channel.  I just casually mentioned it about a half hour ago, and it seems like a lot of people caught it.  But if you don't know what's going on on the Learning Channel, they do these operations. 
[00:30:00]  They do open heart surgery where you see the heart pounding.  Ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom.  Do you sit and watch these, though?  I can't bring myself to watch them.  It's too disgusting.  Actually, I had no problem with open-heart surgery.  I had no problem even with the back surgery,  where they even showed the spine and had a cutaway at the protective shield around the spine.  I didn't even have a problem when I saw the surgery of a vasectomy,  where they take the guy's sack. 
[00:30:30]  No, I saw that. That was sick.  They make an incision, and then they pull out the tube,  and then they take these scissors and go,  snip.  Oh, I just got that tingly feeling.  I know. I didn't even have a problem with that.  I finally had a problem with the Operation Channel this past weekend.  Saturday, I was waiting for the WAF Real Rock TV show to come on.  So I'm flipping around, and I get to the Learning Channel,  and they're doing breast reduction surgery.  Breast reduction surgery.  I'm amazed that kids could find this on their own,  because parents are always bitching about what's on TV lately. 
[00:31:00]  Well, they showed this lady with the hugest boobs I've ever seen in my life.  If you put my head and your head next to each other,  these boobs would have been bigger than that, even.  That's how big the boobs were.  Huge.  And they spent a good ten minutes before the actual operation  showing the lady in the operating room,  just complete, you know, completely topless.  Wow.  The doctor, you know, weighing them, marking them up for the surgery, blah, blah, blah.  Showing pictures on them.  And then they show the whole surgery from the operating room, 
[00:31:30]  where they take this device that actually burned the flesh out of the woman's boobs.  Ew.  Like, they're going to town with this device that burns the flesh so it doesn't bleed as much,  but every once in a while they hit a vessel and you could see, like, blood going,  spitting straight up out of the lady's boobs.  Oh, my goodness.  And they have this on TV at a pretty early hour on a Saturday night.  I couldn't believe that you could actually check this out.  Ew.  And everyone has a comment about it.  Let's go to the phone. 
[00:32:00]  Hello, AF.  Yeah, Opie.  Yeah.  I saw that breast reduction on the TV this weekend.  That was nasty.  Wasn't that absolutely disgusting?  Hey, you know what?  My wife wants to have that done.  Really?  And I stayed up and I taped it for her and I said,  you don't want to have it done after you saw this.  I mean, after they started cutting away flesh from this lady's boobs,  they took two and a half pounds from each boob, by the way.  Yeah.  At one point, it looked like just a big chunk of chopped meat on a plate with a nipple on top.  I know.  It was just a bloody mess. 
[00:32:30]  It was just a shaft of fat with a nipple on the top.  I could not believe they showed that on the Learning Channel,  but if Pamela Lee, you know, if a nipple pops out of her bathing suit,  everyone will freak out.  Yeah.  How do you like when they propped her up when they were done and said,  hey, doesn't that look nice?  Yeah.  After they did the surgery,  they took out a total of five pounds from this lady's boobs and they,  you know, they sewed it back up.  So now she was a C.  Yeah.  They propped her up and she looked like Franken breast.  Oh, yeah.  They didn't look real.  Yeah.  They didn't look real.  There was, like, stitches all over the boobs. 
[00:33:00]  It looked like a Barbie doll or something.  Yeah, but supposedly, you know, it turned out great and the lady was really happy,  but that was messed up.  They just started taking huge chunks out of this lady's boobs live on TV this weekend.  And the doctor's talking about it like it's no big deal, you know?  Yeah.  And they're weighing the flesh that they removed from the boobs to make sure each side will be balanced.  Yeah.  Like going to the deli counter.  I'll have a half pound of ham, half pound of turkey, and give me two and a half pounds of boob meat.  It was kind of like that, too, because at one point it only came out to two and a quarter pounds, 
[00:33:30]  and they needed to get two and a half, so she had to go back to the boob and get more flesh,  put it back on the scale until it measured 2.50 on the scale.  I'm glad someone else saw that because I could not believe I was watching this.  And any kid could, you know, tune in the Learning Channel and see these huge, huge boobs.  These boobs were as big as my freaking head.  Yeah, they said, hey, look at the way she was before, and they had a nice breast shot.  Right. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah?  Well, it wasn't a nice breast shot.  Those babies were sagging down to her knees.  They looked better than the new ones, though.  Well, I don't know, dude.  All the staples around them.  Oh, yeah, and I forgot to tell you about the staple gun.  They take the staple gun to put the boob back together.  It's like ka-chink, ka-chink, ka-chink, ka-chink, ka-chink.  Did about 40 staples to get the boob back in shit.  Yeah, you've got to have some scars after that, though.  How are they going to hide those scars?  I don't know.  I don't know, but it was a sick and twisted thing, man.  I know.  Thanks, bro.  All right, take it easy.  And right up there is our station CD, Unusual Suspect. 
[00:34:30]  Still selling like crazy, man.  Got to thank everyone who has bought it thus far,  because all the proceeds go to the Greater Boston Food Banks, man.  Yeah.  Good cause.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony.  We've got to give away another ski trip to join us this weekend at Sunday River, Maine.  It's skiing and accommodations for you and a guest.  This prize is worth at least $300, man.  Yeah.  If you could go skiing Friday through Sunday and you're of age, man, give us a call right  now.  Brian's working the phones.  He'll take like the seventh caller at 931-1AAF, right? 
[00:35:00]  Damn good prize, man.  Accommodations and everything.  Yes.  How are we doing in our search for a Tickle Me Elmo for our bit for next week?  Well, we've had a couple of people say they have the Tickle Me Elmo, but I think they're  holding them ransom.  They are?  Yeah.  Come on.  We want to abuse the Tickle Me Elmo.  Everyone else has to bring in a Tickle Me Elmo so they can auction it off and give the  money to charity.  How nice and cute.  Wah!  We'll give you some prizes and we'll even put your names in the credits.  There you go.  Cause we want to film it for the TV show. 
[00:35:30]  We want to like just abuse the hell out of Tickle Me Elmo, you know, run them over  with a steamroller, throw them through like a wood chipper, put them in the microwave  for like 10 minutes, film it for the whole TV show and everyone will have a good laugh.  I want to put them on the train tracks too.  So that's a great idea.  That'd be a good one.  Now we got a guy on the line that says, what's the big deal with Tickle Me Elmo?  He says his daughter's had one for a couple of years now.  Yeah.  But his Tickle Me Elmo doll.  It's not a Tickle Me Elmo.  Oh, it's just a regular?  Just a talking Elmo.  Oh, the talking Elmo doll.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, this guy claims that his talking Elmo doll actually says F me. 
[00:36:00]  F me.  Now that seems like it would be bad for the kids to hear that.  Of course.  Yeah.  Let's talk to this guy.  Dude, we got to hear your Elmo doll, man.  It's funny.  You guys will play.  It sounds like F me Elmo.  It sounds like F me Elmo.  It's funny.  She's had the thing for like two years.  I don't know what the big deal is about it all of a sudden.  Yeah.  This thing's been around forever.  It's this stupid Tickle Me one.  Elmo. 
[00:36:30]  Found him?  Yeah.  Hold on.  I don't want to play.  I'm Elmo.  See it?  Wait a minute.  That was F Elmo.  Doesn't it sound like it?  Do it again.  Put it.  Can you get the.  I'm trying to take the thing out of the back of it right now.  Oh, God.  He's taking it apart.  Isn't this funny?  Put it right up to where it is.  Yeah.  Hold on.  I'm getting the thing out of it.  All right.  Elmo love you.  Elmo love you.  I don't want to play. 
[00:37:00]  Hot Elmo.  Wait a second.  What's going on over there?  I just said F Elmo.  Is that the funniest thing?  Holy mackerel.  I heard it, man.  It said F Elmo.  I swear it did.  Wait.  How did they get away with that?  We got to back up the tape one more time.  Listen to this.  Does it say F Elmo?  F Elmo.  All right.  Elmo love you. 
[00:37:30]  Elmo love you.  All right.  I don't want to play.  Hot Elmo.  Play that one more time.  All right.  I'll just do the last part.  Here it is.  Hot Elmo.  Wait a minute.  Hot Elmo.  That can't be right.  Wait a minute.  Hot Elmo.  It's Elmo cursing.  One more time.  All right.  Elmo love you.  Elmo love you.  I don't want to play. 
[00:38:00]  Hot Elmo.  Hot Elmo.  Hot Elmo.  Hot Elmo.  What?  Hot Elmo.  Hot Elmo.  Hot Elmo.  Hot Elmo.  You're locked.  Hot Elmo.  Elmo.  Hot Elmo.  Dirty mouth.  Wow.  Led Zeppelin AF.  107.3 W.A.F.  The only station that really rocks corrosion of conformity and drowning in a daydream. 
[00:38:30]  Those guys rocked the three-day holiday rage last night.  And we filmed that song live last night.  And it's going to be on a future W.A.F.  Real Rock TV show.  Yeah.  Can we talk about what we did?  Our little halftime show once again?  That was great.  We had a couple of the, uh, one of the girls that were here for Boo Bart last week.  Well, we got to go back a little bit.  Oh, oh, oh.  Our faithful listeners, when Ant and I get on stage now, I expect something a little twisted 
[00:39:00]  and whacked out.  So, last night, uh, we're on stage.  And, uh, we're teasing all the audience and saying, hey, how many of you guys saw Boo Bart?  Or heard Boo Bart, you know, last Friday.  And the place went nuts.  I guess everyone was stuck in traffic in the snow.  Yeah.  And got to check out, uh, Boo Bart last week.  So, then we go, well, we got one of the girls from Boo Bart.  And we brought her out.  And, and Hope is absolutely stunning, man.  She's 5'8", brunette, huge cans, uh, beautiful, right?  Yeah.  All right.  So, she comes out. 
[00:39:30]  And that was good enough for the crowd.  Yeah.  So, then what is she doing?  She lifts her shirt up and shows those beauties.  And the crowd went crazy.  Right.  It was, uh, you couldn't even hear.  Yes.  It was so loud.  And then we go, do you guys want to, you know, see more?  And the place went nuts.  We go, okay, now we're going to bring out Hope's real-life girlfriend.  Girlfriend comes out, who is beautiful.  Right.  And she, uh, she goes, you want to see my ass?  Right.  And everyone's like, oh, no.  No, of course not. 
[00:40:00]  The place just went completely crazy.  Yeah.  She, uh, she pulled down her pants, did that stripper thing where they put, they got that  thing where they put their legs together and then pull the pants down and stick their butt  out.  Yeah.  She had this little G-string on and just a, a beautifully sculpted butt.  A perfect butt.  Yes.  You can make that kickball sound effect right off her butt.  Oh, you just fling it and you heard, boom.  It was great.  So then we go, you guys want to see even more?  And the place that they were ready to rip the freaking, uh, walls right out. 
[00:40:30]  Foaming at the mouth.  Foaming at the mouth.  So then the girls start making out.  Right on stage.  Like you wouldn't believe on stage.  Groping each other.  And of course we filmed it for a future, uh, WAF Real Rock TV show.  Yes, we did.  And on this week's show is, uh, Boo Bart.  Yeah.  From last Friday.  This Saturday at 12.30 this week.  12.30, 12.30, 12.30, 12.30.  Please don't tune in at 12 expecting to see Boo Bart because you're going to see El Baxio.  El Baxio.  But at 12.30 you'll see Boo Bart as part of, uh, this week's WAF Real Rock TV show.  All right? 
[00:41:00]  Gonna rule.  All right.  Hey, the Elmo thing is, uh, doing real well too.  So, people, uh, have a thing about Elmo now.  It's been in the news so much that you can't buy these things in the stores.  Most popular gift this Christmas.  And people are sick of it.  So we're gonna do some things to Elmo.  Yeah, it looks like someone's gonna, uh, you know, get us a Tickle Me Elmo.  We should have it in our hands tomorrow.  And then we're gonna film some stuff for the TV show, like Woodchipper Elmo.  Gonna put it through a Woodchipper.  I guess that's the, the, you know, finale.  Because after you do Woodchipper Elmo, there's nothing else you can actually do. 
[00:41:30]  Pretty much after that, Elmo's gone.  Uh, but other suggestions coming in for our faithful listeners to, you know, stuff to  do with Tickle Me Elmo.  Rodney King Elmo.  Rodney King Elmo.  Yep.  Uh, Batter Me Up Elmo.  I like that one.  We'll play, play a little baseball.  Blow Torch Me Elmo.  Yep.  I like, uh, Nuclear Elmo.  Chernobyl, Chernobyl Elmo.  Yeah, that's where we're gonna put it in the, uh, microwave for about, you know,  ten minutes or so.  Uh, Swedish Nanny Elmo.  Whoa.  You don't mean cut him in half. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, yeah.  Flight 800 Me Elmo came in as a suggestion.  Fly it over Boston Harbor and blow it up.  And then, of course, you know, Woodchipper Elmo.  And I like Woodchipper Elmo.  And we'll film it for the TV show.  Yeah.  And everyone will laugh, hopefully, so.  Oh, I'm sure.  You know, the kids will love it.  Uh.  Hey, this is Lou Barlow, man.  He was in here.  Little side project he did with, uh, Folk Implosion.  Natural One on AF.  Uh, we wanted Dave to go to, uh, a parking lot at a mall. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  And start asking women as they came out of the, uh, mall for their panties.  Now, he would have been perfect for that.  We were gonna give Dave $100, and he was gonna go up to chicks as they're leaving the mall  and say, I'll give you this $100 bill if you give me your panties right now in the middle of the parking lot.  And I think that was the bit that got him in trouble with his girlfriend, and he, uh, ended up blowing us off.  Yeah, because he used to call all the time.  Yeah, we gotta find, we gotta find Dave.  Dave, Dave.  Or we'll have to, or we'll have to replace him with somebody else. 
[00:43:00]  No, we gotta, we gotta hunt him down.  If anyone knows, uh, if Dave's still around, have him call the Opie and Anthony show.  I know he was on a lot of, uh, medication, so.  Yes, this is true.  Hopefully he's still in society.  931-1AF, if you got something, we'll go to the phones next, see what's happening in, uh, Boston land.  Sure, give us a call.  And keep the faxes coming, 931-1073.  Hi, AF.  Hey. 
[00:43:30]  Steve, I want you down here now.  Hey, wait, Mom.  Hello?  That was my mom's sorry about that.  Oh, your mom?  Yeah.  Why is she yelling at you?  She wants me to take out the trash.  Oh, come on, dude.  Take out the trash, man.  She doesn't ask much from your measly little life.  Yeah.  She feeds you and clothes you.  Yeah.  That stinks, man.  Hey, I want to talk to your mom.  Put her on the phone.  You want to talk to my mom?  Mom, pick up the phone.  Hello?  Mom?  Hello?  Hi, Mom. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah?  This is WAF Radio.  You're live on the air.  I yelled at your son for you.  Good.  For not taking out the garbage.  Oh, you didn't get me on radio saying that.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And I yelled at him for you, Mom.  Because you probably do a lot for him.  You don't expect a lot from his measly little life, so I told him to take out the trash for Mom.  That's right.  You tell him.  All right.  Does he keep his room clean?  Of course not.  Pick up.  And how old is he?  16.  How's his grades?  We won't discuss.  Oh, boy. 
[00:44:30]  Is there a drug problem?  Huh?  Hopefully no drug problem.  No, no, no.  He's not that stupid.  Check under his mattress for any dirty magazines.  I think he might have already done that.  No, actually, you have to look in.  Actually, the magazines, you could probably find them in the closet in a shoebox tucked away.  Yeah, they're in with his closet, so I won't notice.  Hey, there you go.  Mom's not as stupid as you think, bro.  Now, take out the garbage.  Okay.  That's right.  And clean your room.  And clean your room.  That's right.  All right.  Thank you.  Appreciate it.  Have a good day, Mom.  You too. 
[00:45:00]  All right.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  107.3 WAF with the Smashing Pumpkins.  107.3 WAF, the only station that really rocks.  Here is No Why from the latest Smashing Pumpkins CD.

We will be there tonight like troopers, though, to finish out the rage, right?  I am shot.  For a while there, me and I were thinking, you know, maybe we'll just blow off tonight  and go home and get some sleepies.  But hell with that, man.  Let's party on.  You can't be a wuss.  No, we can't be a wuss.  So it's Corrosion of Conformity, Another Society, and Handsome.  Tickets still available, but going fast.  Yes.  So if you're in the area, make sure you get down there now and get your tickets, okay? 
[00:46:00]  Right now.  Uh, doors open, I guess, around eight o'clock, and the first band's going on at nine.  The lineup, in case you don't know, it's Handsome, then Another Society, and then COC's going  to rip the freaking roof off the Roxy tonight.  And Rocco's broadcasting live.  We're going to take it in with him in a few minutes, actually.  I was saying, that would suck, because, you know, Rocco wouldn't have gotten to see any  of the bands.  Yeah.  You know, he's sitting here in the studio the whole time, but they shipped him over there,  huh?  Yes, they did.  Broadcasting live. 
[00:46:30]  Cool.  And I guess we're going to bring down a couple canvases, excuse me.  Are we trying butt art?  We might do butt art live on the stage in between a couple bands tonight.  We might.  We might try to make that happen, so.  All right.  And speaking of art, the boob art stuff that we filmed in the studio on Friday?  Yes.  It's going to be on the Real Rock TV show this Saturday night.  Yeah.  And the time is different this Saturday.  Yeah, you've got to mark it down.  Please.  We're being preempted because of El Baxio.  El Baxio.  So, Real Rock TV is going to be on at 12.30 this Saturday night on UNI. 
[00:47:00]  12.30, a mere half an hour difference.  Yes.  And if you're confused, you know, just set the damn VCR at 12, but set it for an hour.  Yeah.  You know, that way you never miss a show.  So, just keep rolling that tape, because you're going to want to see the boob art footage.  Yeah.  That's what everyone's talking about, and you'll get to see it for yourself Saturday night at 12.30.  Remember, 12.30, 12.30, 12.30.  On UNI Bijon.  All right, let's get down to the Roxy and party some more.  Gentlemen, give yourself a gift of a night with Jenna Jameson.
