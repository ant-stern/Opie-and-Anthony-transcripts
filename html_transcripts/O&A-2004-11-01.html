<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about Anthony's Halloween trick-or-treating experience in his new Long Island neighborhood. He described an initial pleasant experience with well-behaved children, followed by a negative encounter with what he perceived as inner-city children, using racial slurs and stereotypes in his descriptions.  This prompted a conversation about differing candy quality in various neighborhoods, fueled by anecdotes from the hosts and callers across the US, all using racially charged language.  Jimmy Norton joined the studio, adding his own experiences in Brooklyn and his Long Island neighborhood, including a humorous tale of removing mezuzahs from his door.  Technical difficulties emerged, impacting a recording of the Greenwich Village Halloween parade attended by interns. The parade audio, which was barely audible to listeners, contained explicit language, including propositions made to the interns and interactions with a homeless person. The segment ended with the playing of the song "Everyone Has AIDS" followed by a discussion of the show "Real Stories of the Highway Patrol."

Next, the show began with Wesley Willis's song "Kill Whitey," featuring highly offensive racial slurs.  A significant portion of the broadcast then dealt with extensive technical issues, with listeners reporting only hearing half the audio; some heard hosts' voices but not the music and soundbites, others the reverse.  The hosts speculated on the source (FM modulators, stereo channels, the CD player), received many confirming calls, and tried different CD players, suggesting listeners use headphones.

Following the technical difficulties, the hosts discussed their upcoming election night broadcast and pondered if Osama bin Laden's recent tape was a reverse psychology endorsement of John Kerry. This led to a discussion about the 2004 presidential election and criticisms of both Bush and Kerry.  A listener’s mouse problem was briefly discussed.  More audio playback, including recordings of what they described as two "super gay guys" from the Halloween parade, was played, followed by more technical difficulties and accusations aimed at the engineer, Steve. The audio problem was eventually explained as an out-of-phase recording causing cancellation in some listeners' setups.

The show then moved to *In Touch* magazine's list of potential celebrity presidents (Madonna, Will Smith, Courtney Love, Martin Sheen, Donald Trump, Ellen DeGeneres, and P. Diddy), with the hosts offering crude and offensive commentary on each.  Opie boasted about a photo with Bill Clinton.

The next segment included a satirical ranking of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Oprah Winfrey's presidential suitability, using Schwarzenegger's movie lines for comedic effect, ultimately choosing Oprah.  The discussion veered into a critique of Colin Powell's role in the Iraq War, with inappropriate and offensive jokes.  A longer segment played various intern-obtained recordings: a show preparation meeting, a staged phone call about a job application with graphic self-mutilation descriptions, a discussion about an altercation between R. Kelly and Jay-Z's entourage at Madison Square Garden (escalating into violent commentary), and more highly offensive and sexually suggestive audio from the NYC Halloween parade, focusing on what gay men watch on television and in pornography, with numerous mentions of "donkey sausage."  The hosts used highly offensive language throughout.

The show then discussed the aftermath of a studio visit by Raquel, a Radio Shack employee, focusing on her perceived failure to participate in planned sexual activities despite prior promises.  They read her emails expressing disappointment and frustration with two female guests, Taylor and Mia (described as porn stars), whom she found unattractive.  The hosts recounted outrageous past female guest behavior, including physical altercations, exhibitionism, and sexual acts. Taylor and Mia were in studio, and a phone call from "Lady Di" (possibly Taylor) added to the chaos.  Raquel's emails and perceived arrogance were discussed, culminating in the hosts dismissing her.

The final segment started with a call from "Lady Di" explaining her and Marion’s delayed satellite radio acquisition, which transitioned to a discussion of Marion's bridesmaid experience.  The hosts speculated on Lady Di's wedding absence.  After a brief discussion of show production, a satirical news segment mocking a news broadcast followed, referencing Halliburton, the Iraq War, and missing explosives.  A rapid-fire series of listener calls provided brief, often nonsensical, "I learned today that..." statements, containing jokes and insults.  The show concluded with a rambling discussion of a listener’s first nocturnal emission and an extended, inappropriate anecdote about a friend's sock-related masturbation habits, ending with random sounds and the repeated phrase "Oh, God."

[00:06:30]  Thank you. 
[00:07:00]  We made a huge breakthrough on Friday. 
[00:07:30]  I think Friday was a breakthrough.  It was the end of the first month of radio on XM Satellite Radio.  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh, you know what?  Oh, you know what?  They said these headphones were fixed.  They said these headphones were fixed.  He fixed my headphones.  All right.  Hold on.  Does it work?  Yeah.  There it is.  Okay.  That's better.  Someone was in here fixing it, but I think there was a problem as to what the problem was. 
[00:08:00]  He goes, he goes, he goes, he goes, he goes, I can't find a problem.  He goes, I can't find a problem.  Yeah.  It's not until we're on the air.  I know.  One of those problems that you can't fix because it only happens when you're on the air and you  can't fix it during the time you're on the air.  It's bizarre.  I could explain at home, but no one cares.  So no one.  Where were we?  I'm talking about distracting.  Talking about XM, us being here, Friday's show, big breakthrough, which it was.  It definitely was a huge breakthrough.  Everyone talking about John Valby playing his dirty songs from the Steinway shop downstairs. 
[00:08:30]  Fantastic.  I mean, people got to understand the showroom is just state-of-the-art.  It's just top-of-the-line piano.  Plush and luxurious.  Oh, plush and luxurious, without a doubt.  And there's John Valby playing some Mozart, and everyone's all happy.  They got their coffee.  They're just kind of standing around going, wow, this guy really knows how to play the piano.  It's pretty good.  And then he hit him with the dirty stuff.  It's priceless.  Some people say the funniest thing we've ever done on radio.  Wow.  And we've done some funny stuff in our day.  I would think so.  All right.  Hey, Norton.  What's going on, buddy? 
[00:09:00]  Hi, Opie.  There he is.  Jimmy Norton.  I'm good.  I like this daylight savings time.  You like it or don't like it?  No, I don't like it.  You don't like it?  I don't like it.  Because I can see the light starting to come as I'm coming to work, and it's just kind of  creepy.  Yeah, that's true.  I was kind of seeing the skies a little bluish when I come in.  It's weird.  Everyone goes, hey, get an extra hour of sleep.  That lasts like two days, and then you're right back in.  Two days?  It didn't do anything for me.  Today I feel a little fresher, but by Wednesday I'm going to be like, this sucks. 
[00:09:30]  We're still getting up early.  Still get up early.  You know?  Oh.  So, whatever.  Enjoy the daylight savings time.  Trick-or-treating, Anthony?  Halloween?  Did you have a good Halloween?  It was Halloween weekend, wasn't it?  Where all the little kiddies come out and do their trick-or-treating.  Oh, but it's pretty much the first year I'm able to participate in any type of Halloween  event.  Because you know I lived in Brooklyn.  I lived in an apartment building in horrible Brooklyn for many years.  There were trick-or-treat down the halls in these apartments? 
[00:10:00]  No.  No one wants to open the goddamn doors anyway.  They're in fear for their lives.  Why would you open the door if anyone's knocking?  You should have seen me in that apartment.  It was like I was battening down the hatches.  I went to the mattresses.  I swear to God, any time my buzzer would ring, I'd be like, oh, what is this now?  It's got to be a problem.  And then you'd hear, FedEx!  And I'm there looking through the peephole.  And then I'm, I still got that in me, like I don't want to make it seem like I'm paranoid 
[00:10:30]  and untrusting.  So I'd slowly open the peephole thing and take a look so as not to make him think outside  that I'm looking at him through the peephole.  But I'm petrified, you know?  I don't like those barge-in type of home invasion things where it's like, UPS!  And you're like, oh, okay.  You fling the door open and then before you know it, you're getting derailed in the ass  as somebody's stealing your ass.  I noticed you had to use the black UPS ballast there.  Jesus. 
[00:11:00]  What?  No, the guy had a deep voice.  What?  You're making a delivery and it's 10 inches of black dick.  Well, it's never, you know, UPS and then a home delivery.  Yeah, all right.  Like, open the dough.  Open my dough.  Yeah.  So, so I, I, we, we didn't do any, we didn't buy candy and, and hope that little trick-or-treaters  would come.  You're batting down the hatches.  But I, I've since moved, Opie.  As you know, I have moved to a nice community on Long Island. 
[00:11:30]  No, you moved, the wealth that, uh, Infinity Broadcasting has given me has afforded me  the chance to now move out of Brooklyn where I was for five years of, of, a nightmare.  And I finally decided I was going to move into a nicer neighborhood.  No, it's time to get into this a little bit.  You, Anthony, who, there was a time you were homeless.  I wasn't homeless.  You lived out of your car for a little while.  Oh, that's not as much homeless as it is, uh, living in your car. 
[00:12:00]  All right, you were living in a car for a while.  I was between homes, but I, I definitely didn't want to make a career of it.  And then when you and I met, you were living in, like, Huntington Station with your car  up on blocks.  Well, and then, but that was an improvement.  Yeah, yeah, it was.  You had a nice little apartment.  And then we moved up to, um, uh, Boston to do some radio.  I will fucking kill you if you thought that today.  I will fucking kill you.  Looks like someone needs attention.  Let me and Anthony talk for a little while.  We'll get to you in a minute there, Jimmy.  Jesus.  So then, uh, so then we move up to Boston to do some radio. 
[00:12:30]  And then you were pretty much living in the projects.  Yes.  In the apartment complex where people, like, like fenced off their, their, their, their,  their, um, uh, little patios.  Well, I was going to say their space, but it wasn't their space.  It was everybody's space.  It was.  And they made a little chicken coops and stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  For good eating.  And then the, uh, the little Brazil, I guess they were from Brazil and Ecuador.  All the people that lived in this apartment in Ashland, Massachusetts, where I lived.  And, um, whenever it would rain, the, the potholes, which there were a lot of in the parking 
[00:13:00]  lot out in front of the building, would fill up with water and the little children would  play in the, in the puddles.  It was their pools.  And I'd look out my window, uh, through my sliding glass door on the third floor and  look down and go, I do radio.  Why am I living here?  I had this illusion that if you did radio, you must live nicely, but no, not up there.  I was living in the slums.  So then we got fired.  Then you move home. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  We, we both moved back to Huntington for a while, lived in Huntington for a while.  And then, uh, well, you lived in the Huntington house part time for a little while, uh, and  then, uh, I'm just, you know, given the, the, the, the Anthony timeline here.  Yeah.  And then you moved to Brooklyn.  Brooklyn.  And, uh, you were just discussing the whole Brooklyn apartment and all that.  Brooklyn.  Uh, yeah.  I, I had to leave my, my vehicle out on the street where it got tickets every day for  alternate side parking because I'm too stupid and lazy to, to move my vehicle.  Right.  And, uh, it would, it would get keyed and on Halloween, forget about it. 
[00:14:00]  You just get eggs on it and it was awful.  So yes, I, I finally decided I was going to move.  I'm moving on up.  So you moved on up to a very Jewish neighborhood.  That's what I want to get out today.  You, Anthony.  I am, I am Catholic.  The Italian stallion.  Born and raised Catholic.  Yes.  The Italian stallion.  They call me.  That's what they call me in the neighborhood.  I'll be.  The Italian stallion.  The Italian stallion. 
[00:14:30]  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they saw you coming a mile away because you'd like to spend your money.  Well.  Jesus.  In a way, I, I have, you know, after being paid for two years for doing nothing by infinity,  I figured I would splurge a bit.  You drove up in your new ride.  They weren't sure if a rapper was moving into the neighborhood or the Italian stallion.  They were a little fearful at first when I pulled up because, uh, you can't see who's  driving through the tent.  And I believe they thought, um, some rapper was moving in to, to tear up their neighborhood. 
[00:15:00]  Backed up your ride and, uh, unloaded all your computer equipment and your flat, your  flat screen TV.  All the big screen TV came in the door and I was set.  And now you're living in, I, when I say it's 99.5% Jewish.  Am I lying?  My neighbors are, uh, a surgeon.  I have a surgeon on one side, a Wall Street, uh, broker on, uh, the other.  And, uh, the other one's a lawyer. 
[00:15:30]  It's just funny.  It's pretty much just Jewville.  I moved to a place, look at the map of Long Island and find Jewville.  You are in Jewville.  I am in Jewville.  That's where I live.  So, uh, you, uh, you must've been very excited.  It was your first year that you could, uh, have trick-or-treaters come to the door, right?  Well, I'll be my girlfriend who's a little upset the past few years, uh, because no trick-or-treaters  would come to the door.  And I am so paranoid, I just barricaded the doorway.  I don't want people coming to the, uh, Brooklyn apartment.  So, this is pretty much the first year she was very excited, uh, that, uh, little trick-or-treaters 
[00:16:00]  would be coming to the door.  Bought a whole bunch of candy, put it in the big giant bowl by the door, and waited for  the little trick-or-treaters to come.  This is not the Anthony I know.  This is not the Anthony that, uh, I met ten years ago.  That's okay.  I was, uh, playing, um, online poker during the whole thing.  So, you know, I was still living life like I usually live it.  I have a feeling your girlfriend went to the door with a big bowl of candy.  And you were kind of right behind her, all happy, glowing.  No, I kind of, for the first couple. 
[00:16:30]  You had your little Jewish sweater on.  I did.  I think when you're not doing this, like, edgy shock-jock radio show, you actually wear,  like, horned-rimmed glasses.  No, no.  Come to the door with your pipe and a paper under your arm and a sweater on.  The sweater with the patches on the sleeves.  I have a feeling you completely change your attire when you leave this joint.  I have the Yarmulke on my head.  Right.  I'm wearing it on my noggin.  The little pipe. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  As your girlfriend's all proud, giving the little kids their candy.  I rub the mezuzah on the side of the door before I go in.  What?  There's the Jewish, when I moved in.  Yeah.  Obviously, a Jewish person lived there.  Please tell me you had no idea what this was until you moved into the Jewish neighborhood.  I knew from Brooklyn, because there's a lot of Jews in Brooklyn, too.  Yeah, but the Brooklyn Jews are the ones with the curly fries and sideburns.  But they still have the mezuzah on the door.  And the big top hats.  A mezuzah is a thing in your doorway that the Jews, like, touch or something before they go in their door. 
[00:17:30]  It's got some, you know, religious significance.  I have no clue what it is.  There's a little scroll inside.  There's a little scroll with some Hebrew words on it inside.  And they put it in their door.  And when you walk in your door, you give it a little rub.  But I moved in and got out the old claw hammer and pulled those things right off the doorway.  Because I'm Catholic.  I can't have such a thing in my house, in my Catholic house.  I'm in enough trouble with the church. 
[00:18:00]  Like, I'm going to have mezuzahs on my door.  I think that's why you moved to the Jewish neighborhood.  You know, the Catholic religion doesn't like you and I these days.  I know.  I think I need to find some new people.  I had to pull off the little thing that the Jews put up there, considering they are the people that murdered my Savior.  Why would I then have something?  Yes, I moved into a Jewish neighborhood.  And we were looking forward to the little trick-or-treaters coming to the door.  My girlfriend, very psyched.  She had little devil horns on to greet the children with and everything. 
[00:18:30]  And knowing you, I bet you you were the cool house.  Oh, we had some good candy, yeah.  Whole-size candy bars?  A few of those, but some of the snack ones.  But making up in quantity for the size of it.  You know, the kids were able to take whatever they wanted.  The first kid that came was asking, could I take three?  And I was like, sure.  Take all you want, little kid.  Look.  Ding-dong.  Oh, let's run to the door. 
[00:19:00]  My girlfriend running.  I'm kind of standing back, you know, because...  You're right behind her all proud.  I didn't know whether to call the bed or fold my hand on my video poker.  So I'm looking over.  And I see, I see, oh, we got a little, you're a little princess, aren't you?  Oh, yes.  And then before the little kid even took the candy, the father goes, what do you say?  And she goes, thank you.  It's like, no, no, trick or treat.  She was saying thank you, Opie, before she even took any candy. 
[00:19:30]  So then she, you know, asked for three and fine.  And then a few more come.  Oh, ding-dong.  Run to the door.  It's like, oh, look, we got a little ball player.  We got a little baseball player from the championship Red Sox.  Look at that, a little Red Sox.  That's when you gave out the arsenic, right?  Yeah, yeah, you got to place candy.  Beat him with a Yankee bat.  That old gag.  Who the hell is poisoning kids on freaking Halloween? 
[00:20:00]  Nobody.  It's a gag.  Nobody.  So then after the first two trick-or-treaters, we started noticing a trend, Opie.  We started noticing a little trend.  I have to say, I thought we could start our show with a nice little story.  It was adorable.  Ripped right out of your life.  Oh, ding-dong.  But here we go.  This is where it goes horribly wrong.  We got a clown and a soldier and the tin man.  You take all you want, kids. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, may I take two, please?  Here you go.  Here's some Twizzlers.  And here's a Butterfinger for you.  And what?  Take a Rice Krispie Treat, too.  Just like a Jew.  You had all your candy all organized.  All organized.  Kids could take whatever they want.  You look like you need some Twizzlers.  Yes, yes, yes.  You could use some Twizzlers.  And then I noticed when it started getting dark.  Ding-dong.  Oh, let's go to the door. 
[00:21:00]  You got some candy?  I'm like, what?  Where?  Let me check my zip code.  What has happened?  Opie.  And that was the rest of the night.  Well, the shwuggies come out at night.  I'm not saying that.  All I'm saying is it seemed to me that they are driving and bussing in inner-city children  to the nice neighborhoods to get good candy.  You Jewish people have come up with the word shwuggie for the black people.  I'm Catholic, Opie. 
[00:21:30]  I just live in the Jewish neighborhood.  From this day on, you are Jewish.  Opie.  I'm Catholic living in a Jewish neighborhood.  I'm a Jew looking for...  I'm a Jew looking for sanctuary.  Looking to return to Israel.  Looking to return to Israel.  Opie.  So the shwuggies were trick-or-treating in your neighborhood?  It seems to me that the inner-city children are either bussed in or driven by family members 
[00:22:00]  into the white neighborhoods to get good candy.  Isn't that stupid?  Because I don't believe that black neighborhoods have candy to give out.  I just don't see that happening.  Maybe they're a little more concerned with keeping the electricity on  in the inner-city impoverished neighborhoods  or, you know, paying the rent that month.  And candy is not a priority.  So all of a sudden, out of nowhere, I have not seen an inner-city child, 
[00:22:30]  a child of some other ethnic background than Jewish in my neighborhood since I moved there.  All of a sudden, when the sun went down on Halloween night,  all I saw were inner-city children and loads of them.  And let me tell you something.  It wasn't, may I have three, please?  This one kid, this one kid comes up, said he had 11 friends.  I'm not kidding.  I got 11 friends. 
[00:23:00]  He just grabbed hold of the big round tray that we had the candy on  and swiped his forearm across half of it, half of it,  and put it in his bag.  He was just like, my girlfriend goes, hey, hey.  He was just practicing for the time, you know, he breaks into the jewelry store.  The jewelry store.  He's practicing the forearm swipe.  The forearm swipe.  So my girlfriend's like, hey, hey now.  And I'm like, honey, let him take all he wants.  There's plenty more candy where that came from, son. 
[00:23:30]  You take whatever you want.  So I was fearful of the black child, just like my Jewish neighbors.  I was really fitting in.  As a matter of fact, I looked across at my Jewish neighbor across the street.  And while that was happening, he was like looking at me, shaking his head,  going, and doing that slicing with his finger across it.  I was like, no, no, let him take what he wants.  Oy vey, don't fight it.  We go through this every year.  Oy. 
[00:24:00]  And put your mazuzza back on your door, you fucking cat.  Unbelievable.  That's classic.  I couldn't, but where were they coming from?  Well, you know, when I was.  I could not believe it.  When I was a kid growing up on Long Island, one of seven kids, my parents,  we were pretty smart, too.  We would go to the nicer neighborhoods thinking that that's where the good candy was.  You didn't have a lot when you grew up, right?  No, nothing.  You tell me stories of the big treat when you went to the beaches,  buttered bread with margarine bread with sugar on it. 
[00:24:30]  Our snacks when we went to my grandma's house in Waiting River was margarine and butter sandwiches.  Margarine?  No, margarine and sugar, wasn't it?  I mean, yeah, sorry, it's still early.  Margarine and sugar sandwiches.  Right.  Now, so you didn't have much.  You know what's funny?  I brought up this story recently at my Uncle Tom's wedding.  Nice name.  Uncle Tom got married.  And one of my aunts goes, hey, I was listening to your radio show.  It wasn't margarine and sugar sandwiches. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, she's, yeah.  It was butter and sugar.  Oh, hell.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I forgot you guys.  Now I'm living high on the hog.  Butter and sugar.  So you didn't have much.  And now you're telling me that you are indeed driven.  Oh, without a doubt.  For the nicer neighborhoods.  Yeah, we would jump into our van and be dropped off in the nice neighborhoods  because we knew the nice candy was there.  Yeah.  The big candy, definitely.  The big full-size candy bars, the nice selection, the quantity.  That's what I got. 
[00:25:30]  I have 11 friends.  11 friends.  Sure you do.  And it's just, you know, you just see the contrast between the kids from the neighborhood  who, by the way, were off the streets when that sun went down.  Ooh, that was it.  I think they knew.  It was like Night of the Living Dead.  Yeah.  They knew.  Get off the street.  And then it was just, you know, city children that were brought into the neighborhood.  This Halloween thing is getting messed up because, you know, it's just like everything else in the world. 
[00:26:00]  It's, you know, the whole PC thing has come into Halloween as well.  Yep.  And, you know, parents are scared that some old lady's going to, you know, put a razor blade in an apple or something,  which is so ridiculous.  Couldn't you tell if there was a razor blade in an apple, first of all, that old gag?  That old gag.  So now Halloween has become, you know, trick-or-treating around the town or at the mall.  You have a separate little party.  Right.  The kids trick-or-treat at the one party with the parents just handing out their... 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because they're petrified of their kids getting raped, abducted, murdered, you know.  So they have these safe things.  Yeah, the mall, Opie.  They take them to the mall.  Well, Huntington had the first annual Halloween parade.  Oh, is Huntington trying to...  Was it a bunch of gay people dressed as vampires?  Like New York?  Now you're trying to say Huntington's a gay town?  No, I'm just saying any Halloween parade usually involves a lot of gay people dressed as vampires. 
[00:27:00]  Speaking of which, we went to the...  Well, we didn't.  The interns went down to the village for the Halloween parade.  I went last year.  I shan't go again.  No?  No.  Well, we got some audio.  Supposedly this audio's great, so we'll get it on later.  But, no, Huntington had their first Halloween, you know, parade where all the kids dressed up,  and then the parents walk with the kids down Main Street.  There had to be a thousand people.  Can't even see the little fellas in their costumes because mom and dad have to be the center of attention  walking down with them with their video cameras.  So it's like...  You're a little cowboy. 
[00:27:30]  You're dressed like a little cowboy.  So they have the kids walk like two or three blocks, and then it's every man for themselves,  and the shops were told to open their doors for trick-or-treaters.  Oh, boy.  Dude, it was pretty much extortion in Huntington yesterday.  Open your doors.  It was pretty much...  No one got any business done in Huntington yesterday because all the parents and all the kids  and these effing moms who think, you know, they're more important than anyone else,  have the huge big strollers going in and out of the stores, which is blocking the doorways, 
[00:28:00]  blah, blah, blah.  And people started closing their shops and putting huge signs up going,  We ran out of candy.  Leave us alone.  Because it was just a mob scene.  Of course.  An absolute mob scene.  It was extortion, you know?  And then you hear the parents, like, Dunkin' Donuts wasn't giving out any candy.  Fucking Dunkin' Donuts not giving out candy on Halloween.  Who the fuck do they think they are?  And they're saying this in front of their little kids dressed up as Spidey and Ariel and all that crap. 
[00:28:30]  Trying to do business?  Just fuck you, pay me.  I'll be...  Out of candy?  Fuck you, pay me.  I'll be back.  I'll be back.  It was extortion.  And you could see it on the shopkeepers' faces.  They were like...  They were paranoid that their stores were going to get rid of them.  Of course they were.  And so most of these places had really nice candy, basically saying,  Here, look what we gave you, you know?  Yeah.  It was unbelievable.  That's what they do for the kids now, to keep them safe.  My brother has a good story.  I don't know if he wants to go on mic, but, you know,  the kids that just have the costumes that just... 
[00:29:00]  What are the parents thinking?  You want on, Brett, or what?  No, go ahead.  All right.  Look at him.  No, go ahead.  He was telling me earlier.  He said,  So one kid come to the door,  he goes,  There's some fat kid in a Spider-Man costume.  And it's got to be heartbreaking for the parent.  You know, the parent's trying to work with the kid's physique.  Yeah.  Maybe you want a nice Shrek costume this year.  I want to be Spider-Man.  Why don't we just make some muscles and say you're a Hulk. 
[00:29:30]  You could be the Hulk this year.  I got this great green that we can put on.  I want to be Spidey.  I want to be Spidey.  I want to be Spidey.  Kid's got two cans of Cheez Whiz strapped to his wrist,  spraying it into his mouth.  I'm Spidey.  Big fat kid comes to the door.  Your brother's saying he comes to the door  and he's all sweating,  just coming up the three steps to the door.  Yeah, it's fat Spider-Man.  The kid's eight years old.  He wants to be a fat Spider-Man.  Some of those costumes, you know,  the parent's got to step up  because you're just making the kid look ridiculous. 
[00:30:00]  And a fat kid in a Spider-Man suit  can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  You know, dress him up in something appropriate.  Little fat kid costume.  Something.  A big fat clown.  You don't want to put him in that.  He's a fat black kid.  Put a little Barbie doll on his right shoulder.  You know, have him grip it.  And then he can make a mobile over his head with biplanes.  Just going by. 
[00:30:30]  He could swat at him.  That'd be cute.  That's classic.  Something like that.  Let's go to the swing state of Ohio, Anthony.  If your kid is a mongoloid,  you don't want to dress him up like Superman.  You know, it looks silly.  Just look silly.  He's trying to save the world  and he can't keep his tongue in his mouth.  Although I did see a couple Superman costumes  and the kids were in strollers  and I was thinking to myself,  oh, this is not that unaccurate. 
[00:31:00]  Look at the little Superman.  Oh, it's post-accident Superman.  Oh.  And look at the lady next to him  scooping out shit.  You're sure this candy  won't gum up your respirator works, kid?  We're going to go to the swing state of Ohio, Anthony.  Oh, the swing state.  We have started our election coverage officially.  Let's say hi to Russ in Cleveland, actually.  What's up, Russ?  What's going on?  Let's not talk about the election.  Other competitors like to do that.  But I'd like to talk about the clockwork  that happens in my white town 
[00:31:30]  where the busted-up SUV  with all the rust comes into town.  About 25 little ghetto kids come out.  They're not dressed up.  They do have goatees and afros,  and then they come and expect candy.  Get all pissed off.  No, that's their costumes.  They're dressed up like old ABA players.  And you ask them what they are,  and they just say,  you got candy or not?  And then they walk away.  Un-fucking-believable.  Glad to have you guys back, man.  Oh, thank you.  Let's go to Florida.  Say hi to Pat.  How are those voting boots?  Oh, boy, let me tell you. 
[00:32:00]  Hey, Pat.  Hey, how are you?  Hey, I moved down from Jersey  into a nice gated community.  Well, they got into a gated community.  And it's all nice.  You got the families walking around,  you know, the neighborhood families  with the little princesses,  and then it gets dark,  and then you see these busted-up Lexuses.  You get all these shwoogie kids  dressed up as basketball players.  It's something I haven't seen before.  And then later on in the evening, 
[00:32:30]  you get a van pull-up,  and then you have the Mexican builders  drinking beers.  Their kids are rolling out of this thing,  just running up there,  grabbing candy.  Dude, it's just inner-city kids.  Once the night comes,  it's all just inner-city children  that are brought to these neighborhoods  to get good candy.  And of course they are.  When you think about it,  of course you're giving out free stuff.  You think a little distance  is going to help you out there?  I could not get my vehicle  in the garage quick enough 
[00:33:00]  when the sun went down.  I am just Mr. Wilson.  You damn kids!  I had to clean out the garage  because there's still stuff  from when we moved.  Unlike me and the girlfriend  are in there just,  please, get enough room.  I don't care what it takes.  Quick, the sun's going down.  Here they come.  Like a scene out of  Night of the Living Dead.  Oh my God, here they come.  Get the vehicle in.  Push the mirrors in the side.  We can squeeze it  between the boxes. 
[00:33:30]  That's so funny.  The garage door is coming down  as one egg is flying  through midair in slow motion.  Hits the door.  Boom.  Just in time.  Safe.  Got it in the compound.  Let's say hi to Left in Philly.  Hey guys, what's up?  How about your Eagles, huh bro?  Come on.  I'm telling you, 7-0.  7-0.  Only undefeated team  left in the NFL, Ben.  Aw.  Wah, wah, wah.  Wah, wah.  What happened, Ben?  It was the Red Sox week. 
[00:34:00]  You know, the past week.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Steelers spanked you bad  over the weekend.  They kicked their ass.  No doubt about it.  What's going on, Left?  Hey, back in my old neighborhood,  we used to do trick-or-treating  like three days before  actually Halloween.  And then like Halloween night  because the projects  were like four blocks away.  Everybody would just  shut out their lights  and not even answer the door.  That trick-or-treating  before or after Halloween  never worked.  I knew some kid  when I was growing up  and he goes,  yeah, let's go trick-or-treating.  It was the day after. 
[00:34:30]  And I'm like,  I'm not going trick-or-treating.  It's not even Halloween.  He goes, no, watch.  And he walks up to the door  and this kid,  it must have been a kid,  but to us it was a man.  You know,  but he must have been 18  or something.  And the kid goes,  that I'm with,  goes trick-or-treat  and the 18-year-old kid  smacked him in the face.  It's like,  see what it gets?  He just reached out  and smacked him.  Let's go to Kansas.  Gag never works.  Hey, Rex, what's up?  Hey, not much.  Hey, what's wrong  with having a fat Spider-Man out?  Trick-or-treating.  You know,  we put a fat Batman on TV 
[00:35:00]  back in the 60s, wasn't it?  Oh, that's true.  It just, it doesn't,  the kids are just  going to make fun of him.  I think Shrek would be good  for fat kids.  It should have been  a bunch of little  fat Shreks running around.  But all these stupid soccer moms  that want to be PC,  oh, you can be  whatever you want, son.  And they, you know,  they march the kid out  outside in a big,  fat Spider-Man outfit.  You just look awful.  Yeah, you know,  it can be anything you want,  but you still have  to be realistic.  You have to be accurate.  I mean,  if your son has Down syndrome, 
[00:35:30]  just paint little red stitches  on his face  and tell everyone  he's Mr. Met.  All right,  we're going to take  our first break in.  We've got lots to do.  We've got to get  to the Bin Laden tape next.  All the kids that came  to my door were dressed  from the cast of Soul Plane.  I don't know.  I was quite frightened.  You want to hear  the AIDS song  as we go to break here?  Oh, I love this.  A lot of people saw  Team America,  World Police.  America!  I like that one, too.  See, I would love  to go see Team America, 
[00:36:00]  but the movie's  still too popular.  Yeah.  I have given up  seeing these movies  when they first come out.  Yeah.  Because no one  can sit still  in a movie theater anymore.  They can't shut up.  They can't sit still  and the cell phones  are just ringing,  ringing, ringing.  Cell phones.  God, you know,  we are starting to get old  because the kids  with their cell phones.  The kids are so  disrespectful these days.  Their attention span  is ridiculous.  They cannot sit  through a movie  without getting up,  getting food,  you know,  going out to take 
[00:36:30]  a phone call  if they're not taking  the phone call  out of their seats.  I wish they'd get up  and leave.  I don't care  when they get up  and leave.  Joking.  They think what they  have to say to the screen  is funnier  than what's on the screen.  Yeah.  I don't mind people  that heckle  in a movie theater  if it's funny crap.  Right.  Usually it's stupid crap  that means nothing  that is just making  everyone else pissed off.  Yeah.  So I haven't been able  to see Team America yet.  No.  Or is it Team American?  Team America.  Yeah, why does it say  Team American on this?  I don't go.  I just have people  burn movies. 
[00:37:00]  Just sit at home,  watch it.  I got that  Shaun of the Dead.  You ever see that?  I hear it's unbelievable.  One of the funniest  movies ever made,  Shaun of the Dead.  Had it on DVD.  Why is it so funny?  It's just hysterical.  It's very funny.  It's English,  first of all,  which is funny in itself.  I love that accent.  It's very funny.  Gotta see it.  Well done.  Oh my God,  this guy.  Richard the Trucker.  I want to go to break,  but go ahead, Richard.  Yeah, listen. 
[00:37:30]  My parents.  Always had this tradition.  We'd have one bowl  with really good candy,  like the Whiplers  and the Kit Kat  and stuff like that.  And then we'd have  another bowl  for the downtown kids.  This is perfect.  Thank you so much.  This is next year's plan.  I am getting a bowl  with the good candy  for the good little children  and then the crappy candy  bowl  for the inner city children  that don't live in my neighborhood.  You break out the crappy candy 
[00:38:00]  when it's someone  that you know  is going to tell others.  Because remember  when we were growing up,  if a house was giving out  the full size,  let's say,  Hershey bars,  and you saw all your other  friends from school  in the neighborhood  like, yo,  go to House 36.  They're giving out  the big candy bars.  But if you know  it's some kid  that's not going to cause problems,  you give the big Hershey bar.  But if it's some kid  that's going to rat you out  that you got the cool candy,  that's when you break out  the cheap candy.  Dude, Richard,  what kind of candy  did you have  in the crappy bowl?  Candy corns.  No, no,  not even that. 
[00:38:30]  Little boxes of raisins.  No, no,  not even,  not even.  We went down  and picked up  that bulk candy  like those little gunk,  those little gumballs  that took like 20 of them  before you felt them  in your mouth  and you couldn't taste anything.  And the bad wrapped  hard candy.  And those stupid  Mary Jane bars.  Yeah,  the shit that nobody eats.  That's what we were always doing.  That is great.  What an idea.  Nice, Richard.  Thank you.  Why didn't I think of that?  All right,  from Team America, Anthony,  a movie that I really 
[00:39:00]  do want to see.  Here's the AIDS song.  We'll be back.  Everyone has AIDS.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  AIDS, AIDS.  Everyone has AIDS.  And so this is the end  of our story.  And everyone is dead  from AIDS.  It took from me  my best friend.  My only true pal.  My only bright star. 
[00:39:30]  He's not AIDS.  Well, I'm gonna march  on Washington.  Leave the fight  and charge the brigades.  There's a hero  inside of all of us.  I'll make them see  everyone has AIDS.  My father, AIDS.  My sister, AIDS.  My uncle and my cousin  and her best friend.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  The gays and the straights  and the whites  and the spades.  Everyone has AIDS.  My grandma  and my dog  all blue.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  The Pope has got it  and so do you. 
[00:40:00]  Come on, everybody,  we got quilting to do.  We're gonna break down  these barricades.  Everyone has AIDS.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS,  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS,  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS,  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS,  AIDS.  Shut your mouth  I said shut your fucking mouth  I masturbated so hard  I almost broke my vagina  Watch real stories of the highway patrol 
[00:40:30]  You know the show, real stories  I get violent watching that show  I'm chucking shit at my TV  You dicks  It's blatant police harassment  That has passed off as entertainment  Middle America sitting around with their thumb in their ass  Good thing it's him and not me  Could have been me last night  It's almost like police propaganda reels  As though the police department made this themselves  Because it's got that constant voice over narrative 
[00:41:00]  John Law is never wrong  Officer Bob will teach you not to question authority  I'm serious  They bust people for nothing  They will always traffic stops  They pull people over for nothing  Because they fit a profile  Which means you're not white enough today  Or you look like the guy who's fucking his daughter  So it just trumps up reasons  We're going to pull this gentleman over to the side of the road  See he's only got three screws holding down his license plate 
[00:41:30]  And technically it's supposed to be four screws  So we're just going to zip him off the side of the road here  Rip off his doors and his hood  And we're going to pull his luggage out and strew it across the fucking highway  And we're going to stick dogs on him  And we're going to put microscopes up his ass  It's all just routine  See  They find a marijuana seed lodged under the catalytic converter somewhere 
[00:42:00]  And wrestle this poor son of a bitch to the ground  And then they have the propaganda scroll that comes up on your screen  If convicted  That marijuana seed could be grown into three plants  With proper sunlight and fertilization  That's possession with intent to distribute  He could face 99 years  But he won't  The reenactments are the best 
[00:42:30]  Where they show the real cop from the story  He's some triple chin southern pig  With gravy coming out of his head  He says  Oh I remember that day  We was in quite a pickle  But the guy playing him in the reenactment  Is some young buff guy  Right out of Gold's Gym  With a crew cut and a cape on  Sun going down behind him  Filmed like Clark Kent on a mountaintop  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do  Voice over again 
[00:43:00]  Officer Bob was doling out chocolates to the war orphans  When the call came in  He wasn't  He was rousting hookers for free hand jobs  When the call came in  Confiscating dime bags from high school kids  And then getting high all by himself  In the Kmart parking lot  When the call came in  There's too many laws  Everything's illegal 
[00:43:30]  They keep adding more things  They just keep making more and more shit illegal  And they never take any laws off the books  They should have ten laws in this country  That's a maximum of ten laws  That's all they should be allowed to have  And you vote on a 900 number  So you can be a fat son of a bitch  And still be a productive member of society  Do-do-do-do-do-do  Then you'd have all the laws everyone agrees on  Like rape and murder and burglary and assault  And then you could have half a dozen of the little bullshit mix and match laws 
[00:44:00]  Don't sell drugs and wear a seatbelt  Don't masturbate on the bus  And put on a helmet  And then when you want to add a new one  You're going to kick the least popular back to the people  Okay, I can't smoke in bars anymore  But I can jack off on the bus again  That way only a certain fraction of people are getting screwed at any given time  On a rotating basis  The Opie and Anthony show 
[00:44:30]  We're going to make fun of people with Down syndrome  I just didn't want to be in the middle of the flight  And have him yank that handle  Hoping candy comes out  And blow the door off the plan  We all get sucked out  Except for him  Because his head gets stuck  The Opie and Anthony show  He said I go away  I'm doing the best I ever did  I'm doing the best that I did  I'm doing the best I ever did  Now go away  Ah, the phones have exploded 
[00:45:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony show  So is the instant feedback, Opie  Cody from Buffalo  Says, best idea ever  Someone patent the shwoogie bowl  And Cage saying  So when it gets dark  The Grand Theft Auto cast  Shows up at your door  Also, there was a Mongoloid 
[00:45:30]  That had a wheelchair  And they built a trash collector's truck around it  And wheeled him around  Fucking brilliant  Guys are very taken with that  And then Greg from Bloomfield, New Jersey  Back when we lived in Passaic, New Jersey  We would hand out nickels for Halloween  Two per person  Then, like you were saying  At night the bell rang  There were three black guys  Saw the jar of nickels  Swiped it from my hand  Pushed me in the door  And ran away  Happy Halloween  Let's say hi to Ryan in Jersey 
[00:46:00]  Hey Ryan  Hey, what's going on guys?  What's going on?  Not too much, man  Yeah, I lived in this town  We lived in a nice neighborhood  But the thing was  There was a pretty run downtown  This town of Plainfield  I mean, it was all ghetto  And one of my friends  When I was growing up  His father was so racist  And he would just  He would have the little  Like bracked butterscotch candies 
[00:46:30]  For all the little black kids  That would come trick-or-treating  And then, like, you know  When there was  He wouldn't even care  Even when there was white kids and stuff  Standing there with a bunch of black kids  He would still give the black kids  A little butterscotches  And give us all the baby roost  And everything else  They got pissed off  It was just  Oh, he segregated his candy?  Oh, dude, I couldn't believe it  Like, you know  My family wasn't  You know, they just had one ball  But he was just racist  And out there about it 
[00:47:00]  The first time I heard  The N-word was from him  Oh, it was awesome  It was awesome  There you go  Jesus, Ryan  Get a hold of yourself  Thank you  There goes Ryan  Okay  Speaking of Halloween  We were going to do this later in the show  But I hear there's so much audio  That we should play a few of these  We sent Noah and Nathaniel  Down to the Halloween parade in the village  Who's Noah and Nathaniel?  They're our interns  Oh, that's their names?  And the only reason I know their names  Is because they wrote it down in front of me  Oh  Is that  Which one is he? 
[00:47:30]  That's Noah, right?  That's Noah  Yeah, bring him in real fast  We've got to set this up  Yeah, every year in New York City  They play  They have this Halloween parade in the village  Everyone knows about it  Across the nation  This thing is like  What they show on the news  To show the rest of the nation  That New York is a walking freak show  Because that parade  Is just everything that  I believe a normal gay man  Who just wants to live his life  Maybe runs his own business 
[00:48:00]  Maybe just works for a living  Not flamboyantly gay  He's just  That's his sexual preference  But everything else in his life  Is just like you and me, Opie  This is the parade he hates  Because it's just this  Flamboyant  Over the top  Cross-dressing  Gay  Butt-sex-in-the-street  Kind of night  And our interns captured some of that  On audio tape last night  Yeah  It was a lot of fun  You must have been a real treat 
[00:48:30]  Down there last night  Let me tell you  You're like chum down there  Those good abs  And not a hair on his face, Jimmy  Yeah, we got  We got propositioned  Broad smile  We got propositioned  Yeah, we got propositioned  A couple times  Of course you did  Of course you did  That was before you left this studio  Awful  So it was pretty crazy down there  It was ridiculous  Yeah, we had  A lot of nudity  A lot of nudity  One of the girls wanted to  Take out Nathaniel  Big busty Latina girl  Yeah, girl  Those aren't girls 
[00:49:00]  I'm sure it's a girl  Ladies  Just like that girl  Jimmy got a BJ from  With the big back  Happy Halloween, Daddy  Jesus  I'm a nice young lady tonight  With that voice  That tranny voice  Oh, never sexy  Well, that's subjective  You want a treat?  Check or treat  So you were popular down there?  We were popular  We got accosted  By probably a gang 
[00:49:30]  Of like four or five  You know, big hooded black guys  We were talking to some homeless guy  And they all just started  Big hooded gay black guys  Yeah  No, they weren't  I don't think they were gay  But they were definitely menacing  Oh, yeah, really?  See, a little bit of everything  Shows up at the parade  There are the people in the parade  And then the people  That want to rob them  So it's a good hand  It balances out things  What did they do?  The black youths  We were talking to some homeless guy  And I think we kind of felt like  They might be thinking  That we were, you know  Exploiting him a little bit  And they were going to just  Take us out  But no, they just wanted  To give shout-outs on the mic 
[00:50:00]  Of course  And you said  Get away from me, right?  No shout-outs for you  Yeah  Here, take over our airwaves  We don't care  They pretty much took over  The microphone  Yeah, for about five minutes  Five minutes  How'd you get the microphone back from?  We ran away  Really fast  They didn't try to steal the mic?  You told me you played on the air  So they probably gave you the stuff  Oh, exactly  Yeah, shout-outs  Oh, good one  All right  The first track is this lady  Yeah  That wanted you guys to suck her TTs  Yeah  Yeah?  Was she a lady lady?  Or was she  Yeah, she was like 30, 35, something like that 
[00:50:30]  What'd she look like?  She was, you know  I bet she had a huge ass  Yeah, pretty big  She had her husband right there with her  Oh, really?  Smiling away  That wasn't her husband  Something  Didn't you know the bulge in front of her pants?  All right, let's check out the audio  How did she get from the city to my house, though? 
[00:51:00]  So quickly, last night  That's a guy, no?  No, it was definitely a girl  Jimmy?  You're the expert?  I want to know if Raj and Dee were there  And heard her talking about it  What?  Ooh  Ooh, Raj  You in trouble if mom and her amputated legs hears you?

I'm dressed like a bum  You certainly are  Yeah, Nathaniel felt kind of dirty  Asking him that question  Over and over again  Oh, really?

[00:54:00]  The games people play  I don't know what the Beatles say  But I'm sure he can tell you what the roaches say  Dirty idiot  Yeah  What do the Beatles say?  All you need is soap 
[00:54:30]  What do the Beatles say?  I want to hold your wallet  Quick, more Beatles songs  Let's run with this  Let's run with this  Yeah  All right, what did the Beatles say?  Yellow underpants?  I just live in some yellow underpants

Great  We're just laughing and joking  And no one knows what the fuck we're talking about  Okay  Problem  Let's fix it  Thank you, listeners  Steve, what's going on? 
[00:55:30]  That is very strange  Because we can hear it just fine  And it's coming in out in the office just fine  So that's odd  Mars is working on it  But that's strange  Because we can hear it just fine  Coming back from the satellite  How about in the office?  What?  How about in the office?

[00:56:00]  Yep  It's coming in  But the XM receiver in the office  Like 10 feet away  It's coming just fine  And that's coming from the satellite  So  You can hear it fine?  There's too many people saying they can't hear it  And now we've got people calling in  Saying they can't hear it  So  Can you hear the audio?  That's very strange  Listen to Sex Bag  We're getting down to business in the other room  Yeah, hi, can you hear the audio?  Can't really hear it on the air  Can't really hear it on the air  Maybe we just got to boost it up  Oh, this is always good  Give it a try  Let's say  When you're doing a radio show  You got to stop in the middle of a  Until they hear the AIDS song 
[00:56:30]  Now we're getting all calls  Everyone's saying we can hear it fine  Alright  It's 50-50  I don't know what people are doing at the radios  But we're hearing it  Well, turn up your mic first of all, Sex Bag  Well, for you people that can't hear it  Turn up your radio then  Who the hell knows  Everyone's saying either they can hear it or they can't hear it  Some people hear it  Some people don't  They're gullible  That's really weird  Well, we  Someone has to  We need  I think it's fine  We need a confirmation 
[00:57:00]  We need a confirmation  From someone that knows what they're doing around here  Well, good luck  I know  What?  If they heard the AIDS song  It's fine  I think it's just not loud  The audio  You got to pump it up louder  Alright, let's go back to the homeless guy  If you can hear it  Don't mess with us  On Instant Feedback  Tell us you can hear it  Maybe if the levels are low  Help us out here  This is  Oh, the volume's just low  It said they're idiots  The audio's coming through  The volume's just low  Maybe if they turned up their radios  Alright, crank that audio then  Alright, we'll crank it up a little bit more 
[00:57:30]  More of the homeless guy  And we had a whole list of Beatles songs to go to here  No, that's just the village people  They're part of the parade  You got engines walking through  Cowboys  You got construction workers  Fucking the cowboy  Yeah, great 
[00:58:00]  Jesus, dude  Get a hold of yourself  That parade is the worst  People in costumes down there  This guy loves his Beatles  He sure does  The Beatles  They're trying to tell you  The games people play  What song is that?  It's not a song  It's not a  I know there is a song  The games people play  But it's not the Beatles  It's like Paul McCartney say 
[00:58:30]  Two legs is overrated  Wow  Ha ha ha 
[00:59:00]  Capitalist  Capitalist 
[00:59:30]  Did Wallace really say that?  Yeah  You guys had enough with them 
[01:00:00]  Lady McDonald's  Big Mac at your feet  It's like the Beatles sang  This is when we were getting surrounded by four or five of the  The gangbangers?  Yes  Toughs  Yeah, toughs  Young toughs  What did they say when they approached you?  They were just surrounding us and looking menacing  So we thought we were in trouble  Well, I gave the homeless guy a dollar for his time  Oh, there you go  You paid him  But then, of course, all those other guys wanted a dollar too  Oh, man  So what happened?  That was the homeless  Did you give them one?  That was the homeless guy and then the homies surrounded you guys because they thought you were treating him bad? 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, they thought we were messing with him  They thought you were dressed as Reginald Denny for Halloween and they were going to cave your skull in  Because they're always so good to the homeless people in the ghetto, you know, and they're not setting them on fire  Here we go  Oh, Jesus 
[01:01:00]  Oh, but you can put your arms down  Oh, my God 
[01:01:30]  Oh, wow  Oh, my God  I'm terrified  I actually agree with him  I bowed to the interns today  Oh, my God  You survived that?  That is frightening  That has to be a promo  Give that to Steve to make a promo  See how scary and intimidating that is?  Yo, nigga, there's two buckets  One with shit you can control  And one where you gotta put your chain  One bucket with the shit we stole  One empty bucket with the shit we bought  Wow 
[01:02:00]  I'm desperately trying to remember the tank cheat code at this point  Just surrounded by men in Duray  Oh, yeah  Oh, where's the shovel when you need it?  Here's more of the homeboys  Oh, God  I trust you  Oh, God  God  I will  You're  God  I will  I will  I will  It's a good thing. 
[01:02:30]  Come home soon, nigga.  Come home soon, that can only me.  I bet he's away at college.  I bet he's at university.  Yeah, he'll be home for the Thanksgiving break. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, my God.  Have a little turkey.  That is the soundtrack of what you hear before you're stabbed or shot right there.  Yo, yo, my nigga.  I bet you that guy's job interview didn't go too well.  Oh, my God.  We're looking forward to you getting home.  He was putting in some overtime over at IBM.  Sure, why not?  He's looking forward to him coming home.  You know, in honor of the homeboys, I found our Wesley Willis CD, Anthony.  We've got to break out some Wesley Willis.  This is Kill Whitey.  You are no good. 
[01:03:30]  You are a dick of ass, Wolf.  You are a real jerk.  You are a miserable creep.  Kill Whitey.  Kill Whitey.  Kill Whitey.  Kill Whitey.  You are full of dicks.  You are a no good, right?  You are a no good, right?  Fuck.  You are a good for nothing, scatting wave. 
[01:04:00]  You bring me to every king.  There's harmony in my life.  You are cussing at me for no reason at all.  Kill Whitey.  Kill Whitey.  Kill Whitey.  Kill Whitey.  Kill Whitey.  Kill Whitey.  You are full of dumb. 
[01:04:30]  You are a stupid mother.  You are a low down snuck.  So stuck again.  Kill Whitey.  Rock over left it, rock on Chicago, sure as hell, no other very last songer. 
[01:05:00]  Wesley Willis.  Kill Whitey.  Now what's the problem?  Half the people are hearing the audio we're playing, half aren't.  It's something to do with, what, the channels?  Is that going out over both channels?  Or is it left side, right side?  Some people don't have it on stereo.  What's the problem?  We got, we can't, the people are like, oh great, I'm hearing dead air and nothing, and then 
[01:05:30]  you guys chime in and laughing.  And other people say, I hear it fine.  What's up, Eric?  One of the truckers told us that it's that little, oh great, you're getting truckered.  Well, he said it worked, the FM modulator thing that transmits it to the radio.  Yeah.  You got to do some kind of adjustment.  He pulled his out, put the headphones in, and heard it fine.  And put the FM modulator back in, and then it was half and half.  So now all our listeners need headphones to listen to the show while they're driving down  the freaking highway.  Wait, wait, what do they do with the FM modulators? 
[01:06:00]  He just took it off and he's driving with the headphones on.  So it's only coming out of maybe one channel.  Is that the problem?  You hear everybody and everything from the show fine.  As soon as you go to the CD, it's either like really off in the distance or they're not  hearing it.  And it's 50-50.  People are calling and saying, these people are effing with you, we can hear it fine.  Other people are saying, I can't hear it at all.  So Ben, talk to our engineer and find out what the hell's going on.  This is today's problem.  Oh my God.  We have so much cool stuff to play on the CD player.  Talk to the engineer, Ben.  Should I try another CD player? 
[01:06:30]  God, that was some really funny audio for you people that didn't hear it.  Yep.  What?  Late, great Wesley Willis.  You know, I'm listening to Wu-Tang.  Jesus.  I don't know how you guys did that.  I'd have ran away.  Someone's giving me sign language.  Get on my bro.  Go to the fastball.  Curve.  Everything's fine.  It's going off fine. 
[01:07:00]  It's going out fine.  Yes.  How come this is the only time I've ever seen this many people bitching that, dude, it's  dead air.  I cannot hear a thing when that happens.  I wouldn't even begin to make an opinion because I don't know the full facts.  But there are a few problems.  But it's not from this end.  Our show is going out fine.  The CD player's playing.  Everything's fine.  But it's something to do with the CD.  And the CD player is different than what we're doing.  Because if everyone hears us talking, but half the people don't hear the CD player, something's 
[01:07:30]  wrong with what is happening with the CD player.  Yeah.  I called ECC and they're researching it right now.  ECC.  Which is up in the...  The environmental...  I don't know what ECC stands for, actually.  ECC.  But DC people up there and Master Control are looking into it.  Now I'm hearing an echo.  I know.  Well, all right.  Why don't we take a break?  Yeah.  Let's see if we can figure that out because people are freaking out.  Dead air.  Yo, be more fun and fix the tapes. 
[01:08:00]  Dead air is great radio.  Can't hear the other tape.  Can't hear.  One bucket of working audio, one bucket of silent audio.  Very funny.  Dude, you're killing me.  I can't hear a thing.  Oh, my God.  And then some guy's saying, holy shit, after hearing that, I have a sudden urge to check  my locks and make sure they're working.  So he heard.  Maybe the people that can't hear can go to the homes and vehicles of the people that  can hear and enjoy the show in their place.  Tussler on Long Island.  End the bit. 
[01:08:30]  All we hear is you guys laughing and nothing.  Plus, all the audio on your channel is too low.  Every other channel on XM is noticeably louder.  Oh, man.  This is unbelievable.  This is unbelievable.  Every day it's a struggle, man.  I mean, it's tough enough to put on a creative, entertaining, funny show with equipment that's  working 100%.  Every day.  Why does there have to be something wrong with this place?  Heard Wesley Willis, fine.  No street tapes.  So, how was the street tape recorded? 
[01:09:00]  Maybe they screwed up when they transferred this.  Maybe it's going on one channel.  Maybe it's going on one channel?  Steve!  Let's get Steve.  On the boom box, it is coming out of one speaker.  One speaker.  One speaker.  Yeah.  Steve!  All right.  Well, why don't we take a break?  Let's try to figure it out.  Huh?  I think Ope figured it out.  That's what makes sense.  Why are they hearing Wesley Willis on the same CD player?  Because they're not, and they heard the A's song.  Because maybe he, Ope raised a point about how maybe they, they. 
[01:09:30]  This is, I guarantee, I'm not going to guarantee, but I bet you it's how this was.  Is this on one channel?  No.  Not at all, actually.  It sounds from the complaints I hear coming into Eric's line, it sounds like people with certain  XM radios can hear it.  People with, like, the FM modulators in their cars.  For some reason, it's only coming in on one channel.  I don't know, but that's a full, that's stereo.  Someone said the boom box is only coming out of one speaker.  Yeah.  It's probably recorded on one channel.  It's got to have been recorded on one channel.  No.  I'll check it again, but that's stereo. 
[01:10:00]  Why don't you give her another check?  Give it a check on it, just to see if it comes out of one channel.  I mean, because this audio is priceless.  The homeless guy was unbelievable, and then the homies were unbelievable.  Pan it and see if it comes out, if it drops out.  All right, we'll get to the bottom of that.  I'm sure we will.  Today's problem.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  It's so frustrating.  It's always something.  It's so fucking frustrating.  Let's just tell the people how funny it would have been if you would have heard it. 
[01:10:30]  Trust me, it was really funny.  Oh, it was really funny.  Just picture the funniest thing you've ever heard, and there you go.  That's what was going on.  Because that's what we need to be doing here at XMOP on this show, is alienating half our audience.  You know, I think we're getting too many listeners too quickly.  We want to chop that number in half, is what we want to do.  Well, let's take the corporate view.  You guys are being a little negative.  Look at all the people that could hear it.  Right.  It's the glass half full or half empty. 
[01:11:00]  You know, on the replay, you'll be able to hear it fine.  You sure?  I believe, yeah.  Why not?  Really?  Why not?  I don't know.  Because then I think they record the whole show in stereo, and then it should be fine.  That would be good, but I doubt it.  You know what?  But for the people that did not hear the audio, I'm serious, because I'm curious now.  During the replay, let us know if you could hear it or not.  Okay.  All right?  Because I have a feeling, you know, the way they do the replays and record the actual show for replay, it should be fine.  Yeah.  And then you can laugh and laugh and laugh. 
[01:11:30]  Laugh and laugh.  Along.  All right, get us out of here, man.  Oh, by the way, the second bit, that one, that wrecked.  Huh?  Wrecked the bit twice.  What?  It wrecked the bit twice.  Why?  Just the, the, the, the, I'm not hearing it.  Stop us twice.  All right, let's go.  Did you just put a firecracker in my vagina?  I just wanted to see what would happen.  No, no.  Get it out.  Come on.  What's the big deal?  I'll be fine. 
[01:12:00]  Are you fucking crazy?  What are you doing with that lighter?  I'm coming closer.  If you blow up my pussy, I'm going to bludgeon you.  Oh, stop.  Relax.  I'm just screwing around.  Ow!  Oh, my God.  I'm so sorry.  The Obie and Anthony Show.  This year on election night, America will get some good news, some bad news, and some fake news.

The Daily Show with Jon Stewart live Indecision 2004 election night coverage.  Tomorrow at 10, 9 central on Comedy Central.  Don't forget, it's an hour early.  You're going to forget, aren't you?  See, I tried boxing for a little while and shit.  Yeah, I tried everything to get some pussy.  Ladies, y'all don't know.  Y'all got heaven between the legs. 
[01:13:00]  Y'all probably do know.  You know what I'm saying?  Y'all got your own private ATM machine.  Dick go in, money come out.  You know what I'm saying?  If there's a broke woman in here, something wrong with your dumb ass.  Because if you're a woman, there ain't no need for you to ever be broke.  Especially when you got what a nigga need. 
[01:13:30]  You know, you see a woman walk around complaining,  I ain't got nothing, I don't want to shit.  What's wrong with your pussy is my first question.  It's exciting, you know, being the show business.  It's exciting, you know.  I like going home because I can show off when I go home.  But some brothers break my face.  Nigga, you ain't shit. 
[01:14:00]  You wasn't shit when you was here.  I see you do that shit on us.  That's the same shit you do around the pool, nigga.  It ain't nothing.  Let me have a dollar.  You owe me that.  And there's always some girl when you go home and you're home dumb, dumb, dumb.  And you know you ain't sending that girl no money for that baby. 
[01:14:30]  Know that's your baby, don't you?  Look just like him.  You're going to see the baby, blonde, blue hair.  Blonde, blue hair.  It's a terrible baby.  I can feel the city breathing.  It's the hottest hip hop.  Don't this hip make my people want to.  It's everything 24-7. 
[01:15:00]  XM-202.  The O&A virus.  It's everything.  All the time.  Come on, poogie, let's burn this motherfucker down! 
[01:15:30]  Here we go, now.  Would you take your pants off and dance around a little?  No, I'm not going to.  Damn it!  Oh, kill yourself.  Oops.  The O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[01:16:00]  All right, we're back with The O.B. and Anthony Show.  We don't know what the F is going on today.  I don't know what that was.  But they're saying in Washington that it's coming through loud and clear.  It's a nice stereo signal.  And they're baffled, Anthony.  Absolutely baffled.  Steve took the CD back into the production room.  And he said the CD, you know, the transfer to the CD was fine.  It's coming out in stereo in the production room. 
[01:16:30]  But people insist that only half of them could hear the bit, half can't.  Yeah, it's weird.  You get a couple of instant feedbacks.  And one says, you know, I hear it fine.  And the other one says, stop, I can't hear it all.  And then one guy is like, idiots, turn off your shwuggy filter.  And then you'll be able to hear it.  Selective hearing by some of the people out there.  So I don't know what to tell you.  That was scary.  Because we have a ton of this audio.  It just gets better and better.  You know?  Yeah, what do we do? 
[01:17:00]  I moved it to another CD player.  We could see if it was this CD player for some weird, I don't know.  It doesn't make sense that half the people could hear it and half can't.  Unbelievable.  We should play it on a boombox and put the mic to the boombox speaker.  Improvise, adapt, overcome.  All right, we're going to try the last cut on this CD.  We've got more audio coming later in the show.  Which one is this?  Still the homeboys?  No, we're done with the homeboys. 
[01:17:30]  Now we've got two super gay guys.  Super gay.  Super gay guys from the Halloween parade last night in the village there.  Halloween freak show.  All right, well, we'll give this a try, okay?  Mm-hmm.  I don't know.  Let's give it a try.  All right, let's give it a try.  And please help us along at home, okay?  Here we go.  Our interns were down at the Halloween parade in the village and just kind of running around  with a mic, talking to people, and here they ran into two super gay guys. 
[01:18:00]  Let's give it a try. 
[01:18:30]  Fabulous.  Fabulous.  where the hell do you find this stuff you don't find this at the gap no oh you don't find this 
[01:19:00]  at abercrombie and fitch what anthony well still can't hear the cd audio wow this is so funny  and tussler still no audio fm modulator user i i don't know what to say i don't know what to say  half these people aren't hearing this great now what we can't we can't do the show for half the 
[01:19:30]  audience how does that make annoying it makes no sense it makes no sense a couple feedback said  that their modulators are working fine too so i don't know if it's that yeah yeah great  i'm getting all the audio here just fine in boston yeah that doesn't have anything to do with the  location you're at and people on computer can hear it that's only coming in one speaker on my roadie 
[01:20:00]  too yes uh eric this is great when you have to just kind of waste uh show time trying to figure out  more technical there's a listener uh and you know what today's the first day that xm subscribers have  to pay for this show if they want to continue oh the one month free is done this is just perfect  timing yeah people gotta get their heads out of their asses in washington they really do i mean  this is just getting ridiculous we've been at it a month now we've net we've been doing radio for 10 
[01:20:30]  years we never had technical problems anywhere else we went yeah every day there's another technical  problem what eric um there's a listener who's on hold he has his satellite feed up so if you ever want  to do something pop over to him to hear how it actually goes he's there holding so which one is  he uh bill from connecticut bill bill oh god hey bill what's up hold on now i gotta do this 
[01:21:00]  plugged it in and it worked wait go ahead bill go ahead sorry start over oh sorry yeah i called in  said that the uh the modulator wasn't working if you want to listen to mine while you play that  you can hear the difference so so were you you didn't hear the audio either no it was all  distorted it was all distorted yeah no people are either hearing it or not hearing it now we got a  distorted guy oh great just fantastic thanks bill you were no help well maybe we could listen to 
[01:21:30]  bills coming through the speaker if you play a little more of the fags the fags let's play more  the uh... the uh... fags see what happens here  it's  it's  it's 
[01:22:00]  it's  it's  it's  it's  it's  it's 
[01:22:30]  it's  we're leaving because we have to go to work  what are you doing later  how  no it bailed me out on that one I couldn't think of  he just paralyzed me with that  you're just going to go off with him were you  maybe I was going to walk off with the old  queen I didn't know what to say so I just  let him tie me up with that 16 inch fox  doll and put it in my mouth  another great  endorsement for Carrie 
[01:23:00]  isn't that great who are you voting for  John Kerry  I want him as our president  well bin Laden  gave his Kerry endorsement over the weekend  isn't that something did you see  all the papers open of course it's the big story  once again it's on the front  page of the New York papers as well  Osama bin Laden a tape  surfaced one that was made very  recently we all joked and if you  thought you were the clever one that said I bet  they're going to find Osama bin  Laden just before the election 
[01:23:30]  President Bush already has him  captured or killed and they're going to  break out the tape just before the  election boy you're the clever one  yeah I heard that from at least 200  different people of course I don't think  you were the guy that came up with that  witty thing and a tape surfaced you know  they didn't catch him but they got him  on tape they got him on tape I think  this is the tape of Osama bin Laden  after rehab I think he's doing it from  the Saudi palace and I think  I think he's pretty much working  for Bush he's working for the Bush  re-election campaign I believe he's 
[01:24:00]  stumping for Bush stumping is he  stumping and now all the idiots are  going to call up but and say no you if  you listen to what he had to say he  said that if we elect Bush is gonna be  more terrorist attacks and so you guys  don't know what you're talking about no  that's why it works the opposite way  because everyone is scared S-less now  going oh my god that means he wants  Kerry which means he thinks Kerry's  weak when it comes to terrorism so we  have to even though we don't want to  we have to keep Bush in office exactly 
[01:24:30]  there he's he's getting people right  Jimmy relax it's just my theory it's  that old reverse psychology thing it's  him Osama bin Laden saying and what he  said was he's gonna keep close tabs on  the election obviously he's gonna listen  to our show for the election coverage  that we're gonna be doing yeah  everything our channel during the  election coverage tomorrow night all  you're gonna hear is crickets yeah  because that was a stupid idea we're  not doing a live show the whole thing  right on half the audience will hear it 
[01:25:00]  we'll do election coverage only the  Democrats will hear the show how about  that well one bucket the reason I don't  agree with with that it was for Bush is  because I don't know if you saw on the  tape but at the beginning it John  Kerry came on and said I'm John Kerry and  I approve this message thanks  Osama they found a tape of him and a part  of the tape I have to say dude I think  Bush and and the bin Laden's you know  they made that connection in these  stupid Michael Moore movies and things 
[01:25:30]  yeah or the Michael Moore movie I really  think they're in cahoots together I think  they are the timing of this tape coming  out what three four days before the  election how do you have it come out  like that so the election and it's a new  tape it's not some old tape that  resurfaced he did just made this one  because he's talking about Kerry and  this and that and and he says that he's  going to keep tabs on the election and  any of the states that go to John Kerry  he's going to keep tabs any states that  go to John Kerry will be safe from 
[01:26:00]  terrorist attack he won't attack them but  if your state goes to George Bush well  now there's going to be a problem he's  going to you know try to attack one of  these states and now us as Americans we  look at something like that now you  would think on the outside like hope  said the people would go well now  obviously we have to vote for Kerry but  people are very defiant to these  terrorists we figure it's our little way  to win you know yeah you took the  towers down and now you're telling us 
[01:26:30]  to vote for John Kerry but you know  gosh darn it we're not going to listen  to you Osama bin Laden I'm voting for  Bush it's perfect it is the worst thing  that could happen to Kerry at this  point in the election because it's  pretty much an endorsement for Kerry by  the most hated man in the world is  pretty much pushing for John Kerry I  don't know man I don't I don't know  because again the way terrorists do  things are very symbolic and they're  very they're very rarely use reverse  psychology yeah I don't know if I might 
[01:27:00]  people might be reading too much into  it there's something that tells me that  he just he wants Bush out because I  really think that they're afraid of  Bush I think Bush is causing a lot of  problems they are I think they I think  he sincerely wants Kerry to win it's  like the old days with Ronald Reagan  when Reagan and Carter were going at it  and they had the hostages in Iran no he  definitely wants Kerry to win but but  Bush is gonna win because of this because  you know which was winning anyway who's  kidding who that's gonna be a landslide 
[01:27:30]  stop by the way Bush is winning if you  don't think so they talk about how close  it is it's it's not close when people  and these undecided and the people and  it's all close when you get in that  voting booth there's gonna be so many  people that just go ah screw it like I'm  one of them I'm one you know I pull the  handle for Bush you know what am I gonna  do and and and believe me if anybody  would have been worth half a crap I'd have  voted for them but the Democrats propped 
[01:28:00]  this idiot up this John Kerry jerk off  believe me I hate Bush I think he's a I  think he's a liar I think he's a moron  and his his policy is doing nothing but  alienating us but Kerry he's a bigger  joke a bigger joke than Bush added the  Democrats do it congratulations Dems  you did it so I can't I can't vote for  that guy and now he's endorsed by  Osama bin Laden so Anthony if you had 
[01:28:30]  your choice who would you want as  president of the United States who would  I want out of what what pool do I get to  pick from anybody anybody sure anyone in  the whole world who would you want to be  president of the United States of America  me I'm thinking Will Smith Will Smith he's  so well-liked my write-in vote is gonna go  to Will Smith a write-in vote yeah we'll do  a write-in campaign I saw this as I was  doing some grocery shopping because you  guys made me feel guilty about my empty  apartment did you go grocery shopping  yeah because I want more friends to come 
[01:29:00]  over what did you get just some snacks  did you get some snick snacks a couple  six packs of beer in the fridge now you  get some beer and snacks just anxiously  waiting for that doorbell to ring with my  friends to come over and hang down to the  door you know I got some some chips and  dip and some cheeses and some crackers and  and is your mouse eating through all the  bags I heard the mouse is crunching on  your granola oh yeah well my brother  my brother crashed last night in my pet 
[01:29:30]  and he saw the mouse I thought the mouse  was gone now it's still there and it is a  mouse it's not a rat so why don't you get  a trap I guess I'll have to get a trap but  I feel you know kind of lonely in that  apartment by myself so maybe the mouse is  kind of keeping me company he's lonely  maybe we can chase him tomorrow during the  big election party at Oak Place hey want to  have an election party you wear a red shirt  I'll wear a blue shirt  see who catches them that's who wins  you could follow the election coverage  and have some uh some nauseous we'll be 
[01:30:00]  noshing noshing on some snacks yeah why  not popping a few sudsy ones uh Mike from  Chicago writes the problem with the audio  is it's recorded out of phase you know  what I would oh there it is okay I would  love to bitch and complain about Washington  trust me because I really do think this  company stinks as far as how they've  handled us so far yeah I love being here  I've never had more fun doing radio but  these guys got to wake the f up we are so  far ahead of them and so much more  motivated as far as our show goes than 
[01:30:30]  they are and that's what's really  frustrating me on a day-to-day basis you  know there's so many problems still with  this channel nothing gets taken care of  and it's because Anthony and I really  motivate we didn't get to where we are  today by just uh going ah we'll fix it  ah we'll do ah we didn't get to it no not  at all I mean you know when it comes down  and we work our asses off and these people  like ah you're just one of 130 channels  we'll get to it eventually and that's  what's really frustrating about being here  because we are we are so motivated to  just take this to the next level and I 
[01:31:00]  swear to God I feel like they're just  working against us still still you know  and then uh every time we bitch on the  air then uh someone in uh higher command  at xm salad radio calls me to try to  calm us down and stuff but you know what  the fact is it's still a mess around  here it's just a mess but in this case I  really think that it was Steve that blew  it I think Steve like according to Mike  he seems like he knows what he's uh  talking about even though he has a very  strange last name Anthony his last name  is Hunt ho ho ho but he's from 
[01:31:30]  Chicago he writes uh the hey what's his  brother's name Ken  see it's not the obvious joke  Ken Hunt or you I would understand  see everybody can hunt see it doesn't  make sense because everybody was  expecting me to say Mike yeah it just  means that he's good at hunting though  he can hunt can hunt you know I didn't  even realize that it that the sea was  gone that's how stupid I am I almost 
[01:32:00]  said my wife's up but then it would  have been my wife's a hunt I really am  an absolute ass Ben producer of the  Opie and Anthony show what's going on  nothing that we figured out how to fix  it I think oh you did override something  I don't know some tech so well they put  in a whole brand new production studio  we're figuring it out so I I will I will  blame Steve who puts a lot of the  production together for the show Steve is  being blamed and I will also blame uh the  people that put the production studio  together it's well something's out of  whack we're gonna fix well can we get  gay shirt in here because he's gonna go 
[01:32:30]  I hope I definitely recorded it on um  stereo  I love this Steve impression it gets  better every day because he he was  telling me he loves how Steve over  pronunciates everything he's very  articulate under pronunciate everything  he has perfect diction and no matter how  angry he is he sounds every word out  absolutely does yeah he's got so funny  did you read the story over the  weekend about the guy that killed his  girlfriend in Nantucket yeah kind of  some reason reading it it made me think 
[01:33:00]  of Steve like he got drunk and got  angry that's what the guy did yeah he  got all drunk and pissed and winds up  killing somebody well did he did he kill  her in Nantucket because she found a big  cock and she sucked it hi Steve hey here  he is I see what I do hold on this guy  Mike is saying the problem with the  audio you don't have to come around I'm  gonna read for you you wanted to read it  over your shoulder clutching your hips  push up out and take a seat right there  at the helm why don't you the problem  with the audio is it's recorded out of  phase if you put your stereo in mono it  cancels itself out it was probably  transferred out of phase it sounds like 
[01:33:30]  it's stereo but it isn't is that  accurate yeah that's what ECC just  called and said it was it's coming in so  you wouldn't know it unless you were  looking at some kind of waveform so  whatever so is it your fault no whose  fault is it whoever built the studio  uh well now why because I believe whoever  recorded it should know it was out of  phase right if you are actually looking  at what I'm looking at you there's no  way to be able to tell so how are we  gonna fix this problem so we can play  more Halloween audio I'm gonna have to  convert it all to mono and burn it  again you're saying basically there is 
[01:34:00]  no indicator everything I do irritates  you nothing you do I love you I think  he really enjoys it yeah you have tight  teeth when you talk to I just noticed  his height they're very tight he's got the  tight enunciate properly everything you  you'll really be the best diction of  anybody I've ever met oh it's  ridiculous his teeth are so tight so his  tongue can move and form all those  letters if his name wasn't Martini  Steve it would be the diction kid here's  the next question okay all right let's 
[01:34:30]  have an opportunity here the show  replays all day long when we play the  replay will people hear the audio they  will they after you do the fix it's  something Mars has to fix after the  fact wait you have to fix something in  the board to wait once you go on the  mic dude he's gonna tell the board  something all right I'm just gonna let  them fader know what that the phase  needs to be on right and then when it  chooses that CD player the phasing is  gonna be corrected but you can only use 
[01:35:00]  that CD player for those particular yes  fire phaser well no he's gonna read  record the CD though right you're asking  the stuff you've already played yeah but  the stuff we already played on replay now  it's gonna be a problem I want the  people because it was pretty funny and  if the people didn't hear it the first  time I'm hoping they'll hear it in the  replay so they can be an in on the gag  are you asking about the stuff that's  already been played and recorded the  the show you know we're doing a radio  show here it's gonna stay you know the  first I was gonna it's gonna still suck  and during the replay it's gonna be out 
[01:35:30]  of face all right all right you guys  figured out thank you wow so there's  gonna be it's gonna suck all through the  day we're gonna lose it four times  people aren't gonna be able to hear it  so people gonna bitch on instant feedback  four or five different times as I read  it during the day oh boy all right oh  that's not good all right but did the  new audio that you bring in here will be  okay yeah if I do it completely in mono  and don't do the stereo thing screw the  mono I don't care you know all right  yeah I know it's fine okay you gotta hear  yo my niggas in stereo funny is funny 
[01:36:00]  I don't understand it doesn't have to be  in stereo to be funnier the stereo was  great I felt like I was really surrounded  by them it was horrifying so I guess what  happened is they built a brand new  production studio and that's why we're  having the problem today it's it's just  ridiculous it's absolutely ridiculous  yes it is all right Anthony so I want  Will Smith to be president I don't know  why they do these lists it's in in touch  magazine in touch magazine they have an  exclusive on the cover what did you get 
[01:36:30]  what why did you pick that up how are  what where do you get in touch magazine  what are you a pregnant chick that was  an awful buy a baby drama Mark's not  ready for a child with JLo and then  Brittany's on the other side of the  cover the pregnancy rumors that shook  up Brittany's honeymoon you you bought  this in the supermarket I'll tell you  why I saw it on TV and I said this would  make for a good you know it would kill  20 minutes place it on top of your  tampons that were on a little belt I was  kind of embarrassed to buy this because 
[01:37:00]  this is just a bunch of crap it's just  like star sightings and things like  that it's it's a nothing magazine  really oh I like I like reading weekly  world news my picture with President  Clinton Bill Clinton anyway before you  said he looked awful in person yeah  well I went in and split his chest open I  got a picture with President Clinton in  and less than a month later he went in  yeah everyone was talking that day how  awful he looked so picture no because  you're gonna rip it off with the  president no because I know how jealous  you are because I'm not jealous this is 
[01:37:30]  the mac daddy of celebrity photos that's  the ultimate celebrity picture and you  don't have one close to this I'm not  that's not true I have a couple that are  close and you're gonna put your  fingerprint on or something I don't  mess up celebrity photos no I know you  will I have all the Metallica and I have  Ozzy oh wow that's just as big as this  photo not as big you are so jealous that  I got this picture I emailed Jim  immediately and all I wrote was ha ha I  was actually very happy for you you  will never beat this in your celebrity  photo world we have different we have  different systems you know what beats  that hold on Anthony yeah because I 
[01:38:00]  will argue for the next 10 minutes  how big does this get a picture with  the president an ex-president the only  picture that would beat that picture  is a George W. Bush picture because  security is even worse on him so unless  you have a George W. Bush you don't  beat a Bill Clinton I don't know it's  not about beating a Bill Clinton what  celebrity photos gonna beat my picture  with president ex-president Clinton maybe  not individually but I'll go with  combinations no no no I'll take  combinations one picture one picture 
[01:38:30]  maybe a beetle bin Laden okay yeah  you're gonna say okay yeah that would  definitely beat a Bill Clinton Alzar  Cowie laughing holding a knife next to  your neck and pointing like oh you yeah  that might win that'd be a better one  that would win yeah cuz you gonna you  know how to fit in so well that you'll  just get that picture with bin Laden you  idiot I I've never been turned down  before you know you will never I've  never he's actually saying he could do it  you will never beat this picture unless  I meet Clinton or Bush no I mean I met  Laura that one time but that's you 
[01:39:00]  know just a first lady Laura Bush yeah  I got a picture of you did it's on my  website how did you do that I'm good her  secret service agent I didn't have the  help of the police like old opie over  there I had the secret service agent  this is a court court Congress of  racial equality hold on you got invited  you got invited to a function I'm  telling you there's like a thousand  people there and there's still  security it's run by Roy Innes and  because him and Manny were very close  at the cellar so if this is two years  ago and Laura Bush was the keynote  speaker so I this is where I met 
[01:39:30]  Heston and BB King the year before so I  walk up to where she's walking away  off the podium I have a camera and the  security all over the security guards  look at me going no no he could see  that I was going for the right right  and she happened to look at me and I'm  like can I have a picture Miss Bush and  she's like sure oh I hand it to my  friend there's a rope in between us and  you could see the miserable secret  service agent behind her I gotta see that  picture yeah it's on eatabullet.com  all right all right so that's pretty  good that's a great one first lady is  pretty good better I'm not saying that  that's definitely Clint better one how 
[01:40:00]  much this drives you nuts it doesn't  you want this on your wall so bad I'd  like to have that but it drives you  nuts blowjob president he's got a  picture with the blowjob president a  great photo if he had Sabbath I'd be  more jealous look at my arm around his  neck like we're old chums that was so  he wouldn't move I know they can't  tell if you're friends if you spent a  thousand dollars on a dinner like  everyone else not only that as the  years go by you know what that  picture is gonna be like just picture  a picture you with you know Kennedy  something like that in years to come  that picture is gonna be even more  popular and more valuable that's 
[01:40:30]  right you will never beat that unless  I get that or you'd be surprised  though the people I pull off he is  really trying to talk up his picture  collection he doesn't have the king of  all king picture yeah you don't have  the ace of spades that's the ace of  spades right there that's the ace of  diamonds ace of spades bush the only  thing that beats yeah true the only  thing that beats this is another  picture of a president yeah that's it  how about if someone has a picture of  two presidents oh see that would be a  good one yeah that Jimmy Carter on the 
[01:41:00]  other side right all right yeah so  Ronald Reagan's casket so the stupid  magazine in touch this is what the  soccer moms are reading Anthony yeah  the fat housewives that have nothing  else to do so they make stupid lists  like this the 10 stars who could be  president and you know not one of them  would really be able to hold the job  it's a waste of an article course it is  but you got I mean some of the comments  that they come up with are just what's  that oh what is that Jimmy's photo of 
[01:41:30]  him and Laura Bush how fat is my face  looking that look at the secret service  agent in the background she looks  horrified and the secret service guy who  looks like a secret service guy he was  for real really ready to the first lady  at that point sure she was she was why  this was the keynote speaker he's ready  to bounce on you that's pretty close to  this picture that's not even close you  should have started choking her just to  see what would happen imagine what  would happen if you just started  choking her when she was speaking we're  at the core dinner and Patrice at the  table and when she walked the thousand  people everybody's clapping and 
[01:42:00]  Patrice like yes your husband's gonna  get us all killed he is such an asshole  oh he's gonna kill us all  I was so embarrassed oh my god I can  picture oh he really is obnoxious  what a tool oh yeah yeah Jim has some of  the funny you've got everybody on there  though you've got Anthony Kiedis yes  Giuliani yeah that's worth Giuliani a  core dinner another Congress of Racial  Equality Giuliani pre or post 9-11  that was post 9-11 post 9-11 Giuliani 
[01:42:30]  that's pretty big more than a pre 9-11  that's pretty big that's pretty good  if he becomes president does that trump  Mike Clinton no it still isn't Trump  Clinton's a bigger one because I got  Giuliani as mayor it's like getting  Clinton when he was governor right  probably easy to do you'll never beat  this I'll beat it I love rubbing it in  your face you I picture Jimmy maybe  someday getting a George Bush though  of course I think he's just that kind  of guy yeah but when George Bush is  out of office and they let's say that  well let's say duh and they do they  both do their eight years Clinton's 
[01:43:00]  still a bigger president not  necessarily Bush's president  during the biggest attack in the  in the history of our country I think  BJ in the White House I think  past president Trump's terror alerts  well you know something history still  has to be written right you did you  just don't know but I think as a  sitting president Bush definitely  worth worth more than your Clinton  but once he's out of office it all  depends on what transpires over the  next four years then again dead  president can Trump dude sitting or  Ronald Reagan I don't care if you 
[01:43:30]  love him or hate him when he's  finally out of office George Bush is  going to be known as a dullard probably  but he was he was but when you say  when you say Clinton you're going to go  oh BJ in the White House you could  think on other terms though I'll be  Clinton is a lot more accessible than  Bush is going to be when he's out of  office yes you just know it Clinton's  I knocking around Harlem I'm doing  great I'm out here I know people that  know Clinton let's go with yeah yeah  JFK what do you remember about JFK  banging Marilyn Monroe exactly and 
[01:44:00]  getting assassinated funny yeah I  remember that one little that little  slow turn we never would allow a man  to open an umbrella like that never  you would have felt an army presence  Mr. Garrison the fucking shooters don't  even know it's an enigma wrapped in a  stereo recording wrapped in a bucket  recorded at a phase all right so that's  what you remember about him right yeah  LBJ LBJ Vietnam Vietnam Vietnam yeah 
[01:44:30]  Vietnam the space race beginning of  the space race well you remember more  Kennedy for that because he kind of got  the ball rolling you know yeah but you  know he was the one that was through it  to the Mercury who was after LBJ Nixon I  guess right tricky dick all right  Watergate Watergate okay of course  Ford klutz Ford falling down all the  time that's all you remember that's all  you remember I'm just talking first  impression first impression yeah after  four there was Carter I believe right  Carter what I'm not Iranian hostages 
[01:45:00]  peanut peanut farmer is I think him  just being a peanut farmer and having a  drunk brother drunk brother overshadows  anything he did even the debacle in the  desert drunk brother and the handshake  hmm I don't know what the handshake  meant what handshake you know when he got  those guys again oh Sadat and Begin  they had that little handshake thing and  obviously that helped a lot yeah yeah it  really helped I love when every president  has declared peace in the Middle East have  you noticed that every one of them has a  dopey picture of the leader of the time 
[01:45:30]  before they get their brains blown out  sitting there shaking hands and then  holding up their arms going look I have  brought you peace in the Middle East and  we still have people getting blown up or  someone one worse than not a mouthful of  lead certainly right they were not happy  with that arrangement did not like him at  all uh Ronald nice parade Ronald Reagan  Ronald Reagan's got a few though I don't  think he's got any one big thing but  you know him being assassinated or a shot  at the assassination attempt pretty big  first four clips we cold war no I know 
[01:46:00]  but that's our war ever want to go back  to them that should come in okay we could  try it by the homies we could just start  the show over again should we play the  homies again play the homies because  that's some of the best audio I've ever  heard the rest of the audio was okay but  the homies is good right well the suck  my tits lady was pretty funny don't get  those mixed up homeless guy was funny  about quoting the Beatles all right I'm  throwing this one away throw it away  don't get it mixed up don't even get it  mixed up there we go he's gonna file it  like we say he's gonna mix it up well  Reagan hi Alice Reagan and bring your mom 
[01:46:30]  along remember that one where he made  the other record album and he mixed them  up and sent it sent the one where he's  like cuz she's a blah my mouth sent the  wrong record off you know the problems  that could cause be careful all right I  got that back in the CD player so we'll  play just the can we told but a cup we  could save this bit if we just play the  homeboys again yeah I love that the  homeboys audio is really frightening so  but Reagan it's like the attempted  assassination Star Wars big yeah ending 
[01:47:00]  communism the Cold War and now and then  you got missile crisis Bush Bush senior  Bush senior is a Gulf War definitely  Gulf War vomiting on the Jap that was a  good one vomiting on the Jap he'll be  remembered as yeah the people thought  that was an accident but then he went  for a longer and then Clinton the BJ  yes and then George jr here and it's 
[01:47:30]  gonna be 9-11 9-11 and the war you know  the Iraqi war here that we're dealing  with the freedom that we're doing over  there the freeing of the people that  really want the freedom yeah that  understand what freedom is about you got  to teach people what freedoms about  before you could tell them how much  they want it people don't even  understand what what it is to be free  but we'll keep fighting and dying for  them operation vote you savage yeah no  all right we babbled once again taken  out of our game because of technical  problems but anyway the 10 stars who 
[01:48:00]  could be president according to in style  magazine we're gonna run through this  kind of fast in touch magazine I'm  sorry Anthony number 10 which is shows  this is just such a useless stupid  thing and the 10 is the magic number  they all got to be 10 10 they do 12 her  next reinvention coming in 10th place  it's Madonna yeah yeah that what are you  sure you didn't mix this up with the  best-looking people in Hollywood list 
[01:48:30]  is this ridiculous her strength she's  got easiest people in America list her  strength she's gone from pop-tart to  glam diva to respectable wife and  mother gasp yeah gasp right the seas  Madonna 46 has reinvented herself so many  times president the US is practically the  only thing she hasn't been oh sure I'll  tell you what she hasn't been oh wait a  minute go ahead what happened I'll be  my mic was off yeah I know why I'll be  inadvertently hit a button inadvertently 
[01:49:00]  sure yes Jim I can't say it now I was  kidding I afraid my mic shut off I messed  up plus her cute British husband Guy  Richie and and the occasional English  accent should ensure positive relations  with our prime ally the UK yeah there you  go what a dopey list the weaknesses  because she's constantly changing her  image some might call her a flip-flopper  oh this is just such female drivel this 
[01:49:30]  is what women do they sit around they  have coffee and they read this crap and  they wonder why their opinions are  laughed at you know who would make a good  president I read this it's wonderful  you're just reading this I'm getting like  cramps I'm feeling cramps in ninth place  I'm bleeding from my testicles in ninth  place because he has proven he's a  fighter on screen in films like Ali he  should be president will Smith the  fresh prince of DC they write oh yeah 
[01:50:00]  stop it oh wow different place that'll  happen strange back in 2003 will told  reporters that he might give up action  movies within the next five years well the  clock is ticking and the man in black  needs something to do talk about a strong  candidate a sensitive family man who  also knows how to kick Syria's butt  will could easily erase the gender gap  what I don't know and his wife would  make a great first lady I believe I could 
[01:50:30]  become president if I only tried says  will that's what we need you know how  hit that it goes make the White House  and then it goes so go to Washington  mr. Smith oh you know how hip the White  House would be they'd be playing rap music  and the white people would be dancing in  the Oval Office oh yeah all white like and  and old white people would be using black  terminology oh it would be so funny when  that happens uh uh paint the White House 
[01:51:00]  black uh uh if uh if I have to see one  more white old person in a movie go like  yo B I'm gonna I'm gonna hunt them down and  shoot them yeah he's getting jiggy with  foreign policy oh yeah well says his  weakness yeah being black nah wow oh  just kidding weakness when we state the  obvious he still isn't sold on the ideas 
[01:51:30]  his weakness Anthony being president is an  unfolded profession S O U L no  all right all right all right he's  getting jiggy with it awful but he's  getting jiggy with it number eight guys  number eight oh oh star here could be  Courtney Love it says who could be  present like if like if the stars align  the right way this would happen could  be there's not one on this list that 
[01:52:00]  could actually be president no I don't  know so far they're two for two uh in  eighth place Anthony he's already acting  the part why not Martin Sheehan it's  Martin Sheehan could be president of the  United States according to InStyle  magazine I can't keep my son off drugs  but I'd make a great president the guy's  playing president on TV and he thinks  he's really the president when you see  him making these these left-wing  speeches this guy would make the worst  president ever we have to save the 
[01:52:30]  unfufu beetle that's why I'm banning  logging across all of the United States  why well the unfufu beetle is a  wonderful animal that must be saved you're  an idiot did you see him protesting  during the Cold War if it was for people  like him the Soviet Union would still be  there we'd still be under this umbrella  threat of nuclear war with these people  because he was the one that would climb  the fences and start bashing the missile 
[01:53:00]  silo lids with an axe and they'd arrest  him they'd haul him away and arrest him  and for some reason not keep him in there  for life for a treason or something the  guy just didn't understand what what we  were doing back then and has no clue what  we're doing now he assumes he's the  president because he sits in a set of the  Oval Office yeah if president doesn't  work out he could also in real life be an  airline mechanic or he could be a maybe  some type of a special forces man right  on his way to murder one of our own  soldiers get on an aircraft carrier and 
[01:53:30]  go back in time yes that was what was  that that was that called he could be a  young ruffian on an odd train with Tony  Massante assaulting Ed McMahon no one's  getting that I don't know that one  either what was that the incident he has  been in a hell of a lot of movies movie  uh his strengths Anthony who hasn't  wished they could vote for the West Wing  Joshua Bartlett me in addition to his  five-year term on the NBC series Martin  also played president JFK in the TV  movie Kennedy the presidential years and 
[01:54:00]  on the big screen an asshole he was a  Vietnam hero in Apocalypse Now hero  that's what makes a great president  him acting Saigon I can't believe I'm  still in Saigon his weakness in real life  Martin 64 has been arrested several  times as a political activist and says  there's no way that I could be the  president you can't have a pacifist in  the White House I like I like Martin  you know even though he's a lefty as you  can get at least he's consistent I like I  like that and I think he's consistent  asshole I think he's sincere though I 
[01:54:30]  like him sincere I really do know one of  these Hollywood nut jobs that doesn't  know reality enough to to make any kind  of rational decision when he does these  these protests I just don't feel like  there's anything smug about him I think  that he's honest in the way I don't think  he's doing it to be a condescending ass  like most of them I don't think he's doing  it to be hip either I think that's just  that's really odd I don't see it that way  I like him a lot oh is he gonna offer you  some kind of job Jim is that all I that's 
[01:55:00]  all I could figure out it's a bridge he  doesn't want to burn I've always admired  Martin Sheen even though I find his  politics you just want to get a picture  with him is he gonna be in town oh is that  it but I would love for for a picture  with the the fake president of the  United States just because I think your  fake president United States oh it's  gonna say no way I bet she has a better  approval rating what in seventh place  Anthony yeah a star who could be  president oh like this is a real  possibility or it is he's not afraid of 
[01:55:30]  the hard decisions Donald Trump  everybody missiles you're fired isn't he  wacky with that you're fired I can't get  enough of that one having climbed out of  near bankruptcy more than once this  billionaire could be the go-to guy for  our country's fiscal woes okay well how  much further does opie have to read  before we get to a hair joke yeah  Donald 58 could probably erase the  deficit just by getting more a lot 
[01:56:00]  Melania yet to a hock her engagement  ring  it's a big ring oh boy sure are funny  writers oh boy president Trump would  also put together a superb cabinet and if  any of them didn't perform to his  standards we know just what two little  words he would say oh oh the Donald  would say you cunt no you are positive  weaknesses this is one candidate who 
[01:56:30]  might find the White House too humble  plus world leaders may find it hard to  put their faith in a guy with that much  money who still can't get a decent haircut  haircut I knew it make the you're fired and  hair joke how about this ladies why don't  you just stop trying to be ironic and do  what you do scrub toilets pump out babies  and go oop thanks for the paycheck honey  god almighty they write such awful cutesy 
[01:57:00]  drivel it is revolted really angry how bad  what's funny about this nothing jesus the  Donald would say you're fired  thank god it hasn't been used that much  either him saying you're fired god almighty  you stupid predictable hens  we don't have to waste our time with  sixth place or fifth place who is it opie i'd  like to know stars who could be president 
[01:57:30]  sixth place six six place get steve in  here quickly six place i gotta i gotta keep  my teeth in place ben enjoys when you  goof on steve because you know what i've  known steve for maybe six years now i  never noticed that he pronunciates so  well he doesn't but now since you started  this bit i see that his teeth never move  okay so he could get that tongue work  well can i say that steve doesn't  pronunciate well um because pronunciate  what does it you said he does he said i 
[01:58:00]  never noticed that he pronunciates so  well you just think you take pronounces  and enunciates and throw them together and  make your own little word oh well but i  already acknowledge that i stink no no he  has good he has good diddiction i like  the way all right i i already admitted i  stink we're the polar opposites here well  who's number six all you can't do you  can't uh drew barrymore oh i don't know  i kind of like president drew barrymore i  want to get to some Tom green can have a  wacky press conference they haven't been  married in years but sure jim all right 
[01:58:30]  we're on top of a roof my husband's got  one ball i can't fifth place anthony oh  ho Ellen DeGeneres yeah we need a dyke in  there sure sure do that'll work yeah oh  this will piss some people off actually  uh Ellen has proven she knows how to make  the country laugh oh country country  public service with a smile Ellen her  strengths less than two months after the  September 11 attacks this is what pisses me 
[01:59:00]  off Ellen 46 bravely that's the word of  bravely bravely took the stage to host the  primetime Emmy Awards and did the  impossible she made us laugh again thank you  Ellen thank you Ellen well she was the one  that was brave enough to step on that  stage two months later and oh thank you  Ellen thank you thanks Ellen dumb bitch me  and the other dumb comics Patrice and  Keith all those guys were at the cellar  September 13th as soon as it opened two 
[01:59:30]  miles from there course you are and  Ellen's Ellen's big Ellen's big campaign  slogan would be country not only what I  live in but what I grow in my garden  that's funny though uh all right and then  it says uh she made us laugh again now  that's what we call a true leader and a  likable one too Anthony yes she is  likable that's right think about how  entertaining those weekly radio addresses 
[02:00:00]  would be with Ellen quoting salt and pepper  songs and offering her opinions on  everyday things like annoying CD packaging  or public restroom stalls yeah I can imagine  as we're being invaded she's just sitting  there on her dyke ass making jokes  lesbian with a mullet hiding out under a  mountain somewhere that's what we need  her weakness after all the press  surrounding her breakup with Anne Heche  Ellen has become an intensely private  person and probably wouldn't welcome the  harsh public scrutiny that candidates have  to endure oh right and besides we'd miss 
[02:00:30]  her talk show yeah we would just miss it  just fun writing you know light-hearted  stuff for women to read around the house  yeah that's what this is all the kids are  playing all in good fun yeah all right  uh the ten stars who could be president  in fourth place he's rocking the vote  everybody it's paying diddy oh yeah  president oh put him on the ballot got to  throw in a rapper oh gotta throw in a  rapper just to make the list politically  correct right yeah that's what you want  it you want to give p diddy a posse that 
[02:01:00]  can now carry submachine guns that's what  you need yeah his secret service guys  yeah he'd be taken out to other rappers  lovely what's it say about p diddy i mean  sure opie and the motorcade would all be  black suburbans hey it is anyway yeah  yeah that's true they're probably white  suburbans because he's stylish he's  rocking the vote p diddy fourth place  strengths in just a few short years p diddy  will be 35 has conquered rap music the  fashion industry and broadway could the  white house be next has he really 
[02:01:30]  conquered those things yeah not really  has he conquered broadway no no i heard  he flopped on broadway he flopped as his  voter registration effort proves the hip  hop mogul has the ability to reach  millions of disenfranchised young voters  with his smart ideas and magnetic  persona is he smart what's smart about  vote or die i mean it's catchy but i  wouldn't say it's particularly brilliant  and what does voter die mean it means  uh here's democrats speak for if you stay  with bush we're going to be attacked  again so that means go out and vote 
[02:02:00]  democrat black people because the  good the republicans don't care about  you oh that's what that means the  slogan voter die pretty much goes  against what america is all about i do  believe right you have the choice to  vote for your candidate or not vote well  is that well he's pretty much saying you  vote or or die no because he's not  threatening to kill you what he's  saying is if you don't exercise your  right to vote your indecision will cause  you death technically what he's  saying is within the bounds of the  american dream but it's still liberal  drivel yeah you have the right to not  vote in this country he's not saying 
[02:02:30]  you know sure voting is a privilege  hopey all right um his quote we have  the power to make things cool hot and  sexy from the clothes we wear to the  cars we drive to the bling we buy the  bling weaknesses his wild past could  come back to haunt him you think  especially those mug shots after his  arrest on gun charges from the shootout at  club new york in 1999 and besides  president diddy sounds silly  president diddy they could just call  him president diddy 
[02:03:00]  third place it's uh ben affleck  all right he already has the one the  women's vote oh of course that's right  uh strains it's been 44 years since we  put a young handsome charismatic ladies  man from massachusetts the message  massachusetts in the white house and  it's high time we did it again  campaigning for john cary ben held his  own against the likes of chris matthews  and tim russert and practically every  other pundit around the daredevil bring  up jeegly are they bringing up jeely or 
[02:03:30]  j-lo in this hopey uh we'll see in a  second he can't hold his own against  his agent and turn down a shitty script  once in a while you greedy douchebag  oh my god anything anything with with a  question mark or a quote he just tell  yeah i'll take it why not i'll do it  stupid whore i'm glad your films are  flopping awful the daredevil hunk has  spoken of a desire to run for public  office someday and from the looks of  things he's already chosen his running  mate you listening matt oh he's got a 
[02:04:00]  built-in vice president his weaknesses  he probably wouldn't be able to settle  on one first lady oh he's the ladies  man anthony how about the fact that he's  a compulsive gambler and a drunk does it  mention that too and then he's throwing  out five thousand dollar chips in vegas and  has to be dragged away by his puerto rican  girlfriend with a fat ass is that a  weakness too for president the soccer  moms don't want to read that about their  their hunk he's just a cute guy with  nice buns yeah shut up oh they really 
[02:04:30]  are worthless old bitch speak for an ass  he's got nice buns stick your tongue  between them get out some butter pull out a  lima bean skin on your tongue stupid  from between his nice buns  buns fat diaper changer all right so  here's his weaknesses he probably  wouldn't be able to settle on one first  lady although odds are good that her  name would be jennifer oh there's the  j-lo joke poker games on air force one 
[02:05:00]  could distract him from leading the  country ah oh all right no gili joke  well i would have sworn there would have  been one number two and uh this guy  really does want to be president and he  wants to change the constitution and  everything to to make this possible that  he can actually run  stars that could be president the runner  up in this cute little survey from in  style magazine anthony is it in style  i'm not going to look again no in touch i 
[02:05:30]  keep saying in style is there an in style  magazine there is okay uh he wants to  follow in reagan's footsteps yes it's the  terminator hi hi hi hi arnold hello  cutie pie how are you i'm doing pretty  well arnold thank you good morning good  morning to you too i'm a cop you idiot no  you're the governor of california i want  to ask you a bunch of questions and i want  to have them answered immediately all  right i'm a police officer  shut up shut up shut up there is no 
[02:06:00]  bathroom really it's time now to turn this  mush into muscles it turned it much into  my car now we're going to do something  extremely fun who is your daddy and what  does he do stop it stop whining oh could  you see the presidential speeches may all  end i'll be back of course he does that  you watch any of his speeches as governor 
[02:06:30]  in california he's constantly throwing in  his movie titles movie lines is he  really yeah i has nothing to say that's  and i will terminate the deficit oh there's  this terminate line again right i got it  uh let's see arnold schwarzenegger yes  his strengths california's second actor  turned governor has proven his critics wrong  by taking his job seriously don't allow the  democrats these predators to come in and 
[02:07:00]  take your money oh predator i get it he  did the movie predator right it may pay a  lot less than the terminator movies but  arnold 57 has been giving his all to the  less than glamorous world of state policy  making and doing a pretty good job of it  57 plus since he's already survived 11th  hour accusations of sexual misconduct  during his run for governor there may be  no more skeletons left in his closet so  what i like to grab a tit every so often  what's the problem vote for me 
[02:07:30]  ah dramatic terminator music was that  great music wasn't it oh fantastic  weaknesses people who aren't born in the  u.s. can't run for president yeah he can't  be the president but austrian born arnold  is reportedly lobbying to change that not  reportedly it's in the paper today uh los  angeles governor arnold schwarzenegger  says he would be interested in running  for president if the constitution were  amended to allow foreign-born citizens to  seek the nation's highest office do you know  why they made that law opie many years  ago it was so that some rich foreigner 
[02:08:00]  couldn't come over here and easily  influence the electoral college with  their money and buy the votes and then  kind of you'd you'd take over the  country all of a sudden you'd have the  army at your disposal and that seems a  little dated now doesn't it but i'm  still not for letting foreigners be the  president or risky yeah i like though i  think there'd be some favoritism you know  all of a sudden he's president and  austria is all of a sudden getting a  little favoritism from the united  states true we're so you know we're  making jack boots for him you know we're 
[02:08:30]  making swastikas here in our factories to  send over there you know we're prying  mezuzas off of doorways all right you  guys ready to puke he should have been  number one he's the only legitimate  candidate but this is gonna be the fat  housewife cute choice all right the  cute choice who could it be this oh i'm  so excited the star who could be  president's right will be hmm  unanimously it's oprah winfrey  stop it just you roll that up and just 
[02:09:00]  beat someone over the head with it  oprah winfrey oprah i bet you she'd buy  the whole country cars  because she's already a leader what are  the downsides that the uh the white  house oval office chair would smell like a  monkey cage  she doesn't have a pet monkey i don't get it 
[02:09:30]  perhaps some cranky ass yeah that's  actually not a racist joke it's a box  joke oh  way to explain it i i got it you like  discipline  yes you do i'm just trying to uh make  the audience understand that we're not  racist  jesus  no  we just play them on the radio  that's right uh oprah winfrey in first  place anthony because she's already a 
[02:10:00]  leader  she's met with world leaders like nelson  mandela and helped thousands of african  children who have been orphaned by aids  what  at home she's constantly topped polls as  one of the most admired women in the u.s  having used her star power to promote  social awareness voting and literacy  oprah 50 says my goal is to empower  women and children oprah 50 how many of  them are there  oh it's her age sorry she's been making  good on that goal for years  well that could be her pants  talking to her pants oprah 50s and uh 
[02:10:30]  and it ends with her strengths and how  about that car giveaway hey of course  her weakness she's black and she's a  woman  that was in that magazine okay  oh um her weaknesses she couldn't give  us all cars could she i don't think the  country would be ready for a black  president i think we talked about this  at some other point but no light skin  black could work i don't think we're  ready for it light skin black colin  powell colin powell president he had a 
[02:11:00]  good shot i think he's ruined his  credibility with that uh that u.n  speakers i don't know i don't think  he's showing he's showing some dumpster  full of hummus and uh well this is  obviously a mobile lab  uh bookmobile honestly  you know that was awful you gotta admit  that's not his fault though he got bad  intelligence that awful george tenet  that's just oh blame it on tenet yeah he  was told no he knew what was going on i 
[02:11:30]  disagree he was told to go out there and  even tenet was told to punch up that  info and do the bidding for the president  oh george you got some info for us yeah  it's really you know it's kind of la  la la la i'm not listening to you  whatever it takes you just make sure  that info is accurate you know what i  mean by that's powell's fault or more  bush it's powell's fault the guy doesn't  have enough balls to make a stand and  say look i'm not going to read this i  don't know i think the whole  administration is kind of tainted by  the fact that they kind of pushed that  whole thing and it didn't didn't work 
[02:12:00]  out for him sometimes it doesn't work  out you know sometimes i hold on to  pocket kings when i know i should fold  them because i'm i'm sure the guy across  from me has a flush but you can't fold  that hand because you just you fall in  love with the hand and i think that's  what they did they fell in love with  that hand they were dealt even though it  was a lemon i tell you the bin laden  coverage i gotta tell you the daily news  i just reminded by looking at the post  cover today boy those guys have balls on  uh do you see sunday's page saturday's  paper the headline was butt out with a

Are you currently working downtown?  Yes, um, well actually I was cutting hair uptown.  And now I want to get there because I see what you say about the Wall Street thing there. 
[02:18:30]  Right.  Now I could probably bring in a lot of clientele.  Okay.  Yeah.  I'll be interviewing all next week.  Okay, great. Listen, what about styles? What kind of styles are you looking for?  Well, we do everything.  Right. All right, look, I'm pretty far out there. I've done some wacky shit. I used to shoot people's heads up with Novocaine and carve grooves in their heads. I mean, if that's too far-fetched, you gotta let me know. 
[02:19:00]  Well, first of all, we work on Wall Street, so the people here aren't gonna be that wild.  Right, right. I did a lot of work in the village, man. I'm a fucking- I'm crazy. I'm a nut job.  One time I gave this guy a haircut. He didn't like it. He kicked my fucking ass all over.  If you want to come in one day next week, I'll be glad to see you.  Right, right.

[02:19:30]  No problem. You want us to find him one day next week?  Whatever's fine. Listen, I'll bring my children down. I carved the shit out of their heads, too. But it looks good. It looks good. You never heard of that before?  Excuse me?  Did you ever hear of that procedure?  Yes.  Is that something or what?  Uh, I don't think anyone down here would want that done, so I wouldn't worry about it too much.  Alright, great. Well, I'll come down and you can show me your shit.

[02:21:00]  When two tribes go to war.  One is all that you can.  Score!  Score!  Score!  Score!  When two tribes go to war.  One is all that you can.  Score!  Working for the Black Cat!  We got two tribes.  Sending that song out to Jay-Z.  And his posse, yo!  Yo!  Yo!  Yeah, a little trouble at Madison Square Garden. 
[02:21:30]  Madison Square Garden, greatest city in the world.  A little problem in Madison Square Garden.  Yeah, R. Kelly and Jay-Z's posse's going at it.  What the hell is R. Kelly thinking he could hang with the Jay-Z?  He's trying to change the image, Opie.  He wants to have a little more street cred, be a little more tough.  R. Kelly is the I believe I can fly guy.  He's the I believe I can rape a young girl.  And pee on her.  They didn't know he was doing that behind closed doors.  He was the nice guy.  He was singing those cute little stars. 
[02:22:00]  I believe I can fly.  I believe I can touch the sky.  Shut up.  Cue footage of Michael Jordan.  Go ahead.  Yeah, there you go.  You know, he was that guy.  All nice and stuff until we found out that he was a perv behind closed doors.  How is he doing the garden when there's footage of him urinating on a child?  How is that possible?  America!  Fuck yeah!  And we had to sit out a radio for two years for our stupid little thing.  This guy is peeing on little girls and gets to-  And there's video of it! 
[02:22:30]  And there's video.  There's not even video of our couple having sex at St. Pat's.  It was all allegedly.  A video.  Well.  It was all hearsay.  And we have to sit out doing what we love to do for two years.  And this guy is peeing on chicks.  And he's at a sold out concert this weekend at Madison Square Garden.  Apparently his audience doesn't care, Opie.  They seem to-  What about society?  Look, society might be a little afraid to make accusations and point fingers.  Is no one prostituting that?  Dude, there's a video of it.  People are a little scared. 
[02:23:00]  You come off looking a little-  What's the word I'm looking for?  If you accuse R. Kelly of things like that.  Accurate?  And really want to push to have him prosecuted.  Racist?  Yeah, that's probably the word I'm looking for.  You don't want to come across like that.  So what happened at the Garden?  Well, apparently-  You were the one who emailed me.  I love the story.  You were so excited.  I love the story because it just proves R. Kelly is such a pussy  and does not belong even on the same stage with Jay-Z 
[02:23:30]  because he can't hack it.  The guy, he gets on stage, R. Kelly,  he looks down at the crowd and thinks he sees a couple of guys waving some guns in the air.  Waving the guns in the air like they just don't care.  Because it is New York City and you could just easily get a gun into Madison Square Garden.  Are you high?  But you would assume at a Jay-Z show there probably are guns in the audience.  I would assume there's guns in the audience.  I don't know.  I wouldn't think security is that good that you can't get a gun into Madison Square Garden. 
[02:24:00]  I would assume that a well-motivated young man could probably get a gun in there.  So he thinks he sees a gun.  And he doesn't want to get shot up.  So he leaves the stage.  Walks off.  Tells security.  Security stops the show.  They go out searching people.  Takes a long time.  They finally convince him that it's okay.  No one's got a gun.  So he's getting ready to retake the stage.  As he's walking past some of Jay-Z's posse Opie.  Some of his posse.  Pull out some pepper spray. 
[02:24:30]  99 problems but the bitch ain't won.  Let's go.  Pull out some pepper spray.  Love that song.  And sprayed R. Kelly in the face with the pepper spray.  Yeah.  R. Kelly goes down.  They pick him up.  Wipe his eyes out.  He's got to be taken to the hospital.  Did they get a chick to pee in his eyes to clear out his eyes?  That didn't work.  So they take him to the hospital.  And our own band was in the area.  I live right by that hospital.  So I walked by.  I was like, what the hell's going on?  There's a lot of brothers outside.  A lot of cops. 
[02:25:00]  There's so many cops.  Of course.  Trying to keep security.  Of course.  The cops saw an opportunity.  Yeah.  I can make my quota.  Those freaking animals.  I can make my quota on collars this night.  Let me tell you.  Can you just imagine what was being said on the police radios?  The police radios.  Oh.  Opportunity at St. Vincent's Hospital.  A bunch of Canadians getting together.  Now, here's the problem.  Hey, we hang with the NYPD.  Those guys got problems, man.  Oh, they're hysterical.  I love it.  I went along on a ride-along with one of them. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  Ooh.  Fun-filled.  Fun-filled, man.  The stuff you hear.  Yes.  Great.  There's no difference between the races.  I mean, because it happens all the time at rock concerts where they mace each other.  Right.  You know what I mean?  The Stones.  Yeah.  When they would tour in Living Color, there was always a problem.  White people are good for trampling, for inadvertently trampling each other at concerts.  It's just different crimes.  Guns N' Roses.  People get trampled and, like, throw chairs and stuff.  It's trampling and rioting.  The who.  The who.  People trying to get out when they were singing. 
[02:26:00]  Who are you?  Ugh.  Cincinnati, I think it was.  Seven people, right?  I think.  Died.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The thing is with the artists going at each other, you know.  You get a ridiculous Guns N' Roses fight with, what?  Vince Neil.  Who is that?  With Vince Neil.  You know, you get those things.  What are these two faggots going to do to each other, you know?  Black in their already mascara-ed eyes.  You know?  But these guys, the rappers, you know what happens there.  They're the real deal.  You end up dead. 
[02:26:30]  You end up dead.  And Puffy goes on to fame and fortune because of one of those shootings.  That would be, yeah.  All right.  So, that's what happened down there.  Yeah, so that's what happened.  Now, anyone else, if anyone else was disrespected, like R. Kelly was disrespected by Jay-Z.  Now, Jay-Z's saying that he just couldn't take the fact that Jay-Z was getting so much  love on stage from the people.  And he's saying R. Kelly had no reason to leave the stage.  He pretty much pussied out. 
[02:27:00]  And R. Kelly never confronts anyone on these things.  Always walks away.  I'm saying R. Kelly, if he really wants to change his image, get some street cred,  and be down with these gangsters, he needs to shoot Jay-Z.  So, if R. Kelly, I think if R. Kelly shoots Jay-Z.  Are you insane?  What?  I'm thinking it's a good career move.  This is Anthony's commentary.  Yeah, why would Anthony say that?  Anthony's commentary.  I'm just saying.  Anthony is saying.  Are you insane?  Yo, Nate, I'm not condoning this shit. 
[02:27:30]  I'm just saying.  I'm just saying.  Yo, Jay-Z is the real deal, yo.  I'm just saying.  He should shoot him.  He's got killers.  K-I-L-A-Z.  He does have killers.  What am I supposed to do?  Shoot him?  Not such a bad idea.  Hey, look.  Hey.  I didn't mean that.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean that.  I'm sorry.  He's disrespected, and he has to get some street justice.  He's got to get some justice, because R. Kelly is just known for walking away from  these things.  He's been dissed in the past, and he's non-confrontational. 
[02:28:00]  Until you confront these people.  You'd walk away, too, if you had a girl waiting for you back in your crib that's ready  to take a leak on you.  You let an 11-year-old steal candy from you.  What are you going to turn around and do?  Let his posse scoop little Mars bars out of the dish?  Scoop all my candy out of the dish.  I'll tell you what, Buck, Buck, I'm turning my gats sideways.  He needs to...  I'm just saying.  I'm not condoning it.  You better slow down.  I'm just saying.  You better slow down.  R. Kelly really needs to shoot Jay-Z. 
[02:28:30]  You're saying in that world of violence, to get respect, that would be the way in that  world to get respect.  Absolutely.  And I completely disagree with what Anthony is saying today.  Oh, my God.  No, he needs to shoot him.  Dude, man.  This is like talking about the mafia.  Are you insane?  No, it ain't.  I ain't got no beat.  That's right.  Jay-Z doesn't deny that he exists.  Let's go to Earl.  These rappers are honest about it.  Let's go to our black cars bonded, everybody.  It's Earl.  What up, buddy?  Hey, who's the...  Oh!  Ah!  Holy crap.  Oh, he missed me. 
[02:29:00]  Jesus, dude.  Yeah, boy.  Buck, Buck, Buck, Buck G.  That's all he needs to do.  Anthony, are you insane?  Shut up, Jay-Z.  Earl, for a second.  Jay-Z, do you mind if I talk to you for a minute?  Yeah.  I got my music playing in the back of it.  Look.  You think the music just follows him wherever he goes?  Yeah, this plays over him all the time so people know who he is.  Right.  Look, I didn't enjoy the pepper spray and the disses you gave me.  So I got something for you. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, motherfucker!  Yeah, boy!  How about that?  Jesus.  Yeah, wouldn't you like to see that?  You think this song was playing while that girl's taking a leak on him?  I feel sorry for your mother.  What'd you say about my mom's?  What'd you say?  Don't be dinked.  Should've just let them leave the store.  Yeah.  Take the beer.  And show everybody the videotape.  That's a bright move.  What's that bright move?  I feel sorry for your mother.  What did you say about my mama? 
[02:30:00]  Oh, a bottle rocket hit him.  Still gotta get these buttons down, don't I?  It's kinda silly when a gangster shoots a bottle rocket at him.  What is Jay-Z saying?  He's just saying that he believes he can fly.  Let's go to our black correspondent.  It's Earl.  Earl!  Yo.  What do you know about this?  What are they saying on the street?  It's the word on the street, Earl.  What's the word?  Well, you're absolutely right.  What is going on in R. Kelly's brain right now?  He's insane. 
[02:30:30]  He's absolutely insane.  Thanks for the insight, Earl.  Wow.  And there's our black correspondent, Earl.  You heard Earl say it here.  That's insane.  That's insane.  That's an O.P. Anthony exclusive.  That's right.  Jesus.  Wow.  Let's go to our pundit, Earl.  That's right.  That's just crazy.  Wow.  Way to let us in, Earl.  Thanks.  Share with the viewers what Earl meant by, that's insane.  That's insane.  What he meant was, that's insane.  Back to you, O.P.  You'll be. 
[02:31:00]  That's insane.  You'll be.  The guy is the worst.  He meant, that's not normal.  Repeat.  All right.  This is going to lead nicely into the homeboys audio from the Halloween parade in the village.  Oh, yeah.  Hopefully this will work.  Give us a thumbs up or a thumbs down on the instant feedback, because I think we fixed  the phasing problem, Anthony.  This is recorded in mono, so it should work.  Mono e mono.  Let's see.  So our interns went down to the Halloween parade down there in the village.  They got surrounded by the homeboys, and the homeboys pretty much took over the microphone 
[02:31:30]  and said whatever the hell they wanted to say.  They rocked the mic, O.P.  They certainly rocked the mic.  Some shout outs.  Let's go back to this and see if this works, then we can play more audio from the Halloween  parade.  Finally, an hour and a half later, by the way.  Good.  What?  Yo, yo.  Make sure y'all put this on the radio.  All right.  Wasn't it XM Satellite?  That's right.  XM Satellite.  Is it on right now?  No, it'll be taped.  I'm taped.  It's taping right now?

Did you think Bubby was stealing a unit out of a car and going,  Hey, that's me, motherfucker.  Hey, that's me.  Hey, hello, man.  I like the one guy who's serious.  Like, yo, yo, yo.  No, for real.  A shout out to XM.  The guy who's really auditioning for.  No, no. 
[02:33:30]  For real.  Yeah, for real.  You feeling me?  Cash money.  Wow.  That was like hardcore.  That's the real deal, Opie.  Right from the streets of New York.  Brooklyn Crown Heights, you feeling me?  I'm feeling fear is what I was feeling.  Just listening to that.  It's all about the Benjamins, Opie.  Did you notice that?  I heard that.  Big money.  The whole money thing.  Cash.  I do believe it's called Cheddar.  Probably three, five years ago it was called Cheddar.  I'm sure there's a much different name for it now. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, really?  Well, Earl will let us know because he's back on.  Oh, Earl is back on?  But first, let's go to Rob in Connecticut.  Hey, Rob.  What's up, fellas?  Welcome back.  Thanks, Rob.  I gotta tell you, man.  You've been playing a little way too much GTA.  Oh, really?  You down with the homeboys shooting each other left and right?  Well, I just think he needs a little street cred, R. Kelly.  I'm here, but the game is incredible, though.  It's so off the hook.  I have been playing a lot of it, man.  I have been playing a lot.  I didn't play yesterday because it was Sunday.  Football was on.  Football was on.  But I've been playing every day about three hours a day and just yo nigga this, yo nigga 
[02:34:30]  that.  It's crazy.  It's like hanging out with a gang.  Yeah.  It's like hanging out with a gang.  Absolutely.  Go ahead, go ahead.  No, I'm sorry.  I mean, I'm black, so it's like, you know, the first five minutes you sit there and your  mouth is open like, I can't believe this is actually a game.  That kid's an Idaho losing their minds.  Yeah.  Flipping out.  What?  What'd you say?  What's that game you playing?  It's just off the hook.  And after a while you get used to it and you get used to all the lingo and the people.  There's characters in there that you're hanging with. 
[02:35:00]  They're your posse.  You know, and you hang out with them.  I'm kind of growing attached to some of the people and I know they're going to buy  it at some point in the game.  But they might want to move into your Jewish neighborhood, Anthony.  They're what?  Well, I don't have a problem then.  I haven't been to that section of GTA yet.  All right.  You're going to have a problem.  Good.  All right.  Thanks, Rob.  All right, boys.  Take it easy.  Let's go back to our black correspondent.  It's Earl.  Yes, Earl.  Yo, guys.  Oh, we're getting a thumbs up on the audio.  We fixed that problem.  Good.  We fixed it.  It only wasted an hour and a half of good radio today. 
[02:35:30]  But we've got to figure it out now.  All right.  Go ahead, Earl.  Yeah, they're sparkling pillars of the neighborhood, Opie.  But yes, it is still cheddar.  It is cheddar?  Still cheddar.  You're taking Earl's word for it?  Yeah.  All right, Earl.  So why do you call back?  It's hunky.  Well, going back to the garden thing, it's insane to walk out on any crowd at the garden.  Yeah.  I mean, because think about it.  You've got 20,000 black people congregated in one place to see you, and then you walk away. 
[02:36:00]  Would one of the acts from the Black Rock Coalition have walked off stage, Earl?  No.  And what act would that have been?  What act would that have been?  Living Color?  Right, yeah.  Living Color, who are actually on tour right now.  You do realize that you make Al Roker look like Old Dirty Bastard, don't you, Earl?  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  It's too early in the morning.  Earl, did you dress up for Halloween?  No, I did not.  What would an Earl dress up as for Halloween?  Would you paint your face green?  Black Shrek. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, you're definitely the Black Shrek.  No, I did not dress up for Halloween.  No?  No, not at all.  You didn't come to my door and swipe half my candy, did you?  No.  Oh, yeah.  I thought he was a little short for that, Earl.  All right, Earl.  Thanks for the fake laughing.  It's wonderful.  It's really working.  I'm not fake laughing.  Oh, we're just so funny, right?  We're so funny you had to just kind of give that chuckle.  Earl.  Earl, what do you think the real problem between R. Kelly and Jay-Z is?  Jealousy. 
[02:37:00]  What's that?  Jealousy.  Well, what do you think?  Now, is it jealousy over career moves, or is it jealousy over shaking papers, or is  it jealousy over fan adoration?  What do you think the root of the problem is besides jealousy over what?  I think...  I love setting him up and knocking him down.  That's so funny.  Earl.  Well, I think after careful consideration of the quid...  Oh, he's still going.  Oh, yeah.  Of course he is.  All right.  We got more Halloween audio, Anthony. 
[02:37:30]  That's what I want to hear.  So, what was the setup again?  Because I've got to read this thing here for a second.  Setup for what?  Halloween audio?

[02:53:30]  set it crack at my home  Well, I could give you a big ending, but I can't because of what we're doing here. 
[02:54:00]  No, no, stop with the rhymes. Stop with that already. People drive me out of my mind with my fucking stupid rhymes that I hate to do.  I mean, don't get me wrong, when I first did them, it was creative. It was like doing this, you know what I mean? 
[02:54:30]  I mean, I'll tell you the way it is. You know, a comic creates a bit, like a musician comes up with a song.  It's like if Axl Rose always only did Welcome to the Jungle, and that's all he ever did.  Once you get fucking bored with it, Paul. Right?  So I came up with the poems. I did it. People really dug it.  You know, I did a few concert tours. I did the fucking poems.  And now everywhere I fucking go, oh, do the poem.  No! I hate the fucking poems. You have no fucking idea how I feel about those fucking poems. 
[02:55:00]  I wish I never came up with the fucking poems.  Because the guy's like that.  And they'll come over to me in the mall, in the car wash, in the fucking supermarket, wherever.  Dude, you know that poem you do?  The Little Miss Mother?  No, I don't know.  I've done it 50,000 fucking times in the four years.  How the fuck don't I know it?  And then the guy looks at me like, oh, you want to have an attitude about it? 
[02:55:30]  Got another song?  But here's something.  Betty and Jack up a tree.  F-U-C-K-I-N-G.  First comes Betty, then comes Jack.  Then comes the goo out of Betty's crack.  You see what I mean? 
[02:56:00]  I know what you're doing.  But I've done it.  So I guess a year from now, you'll be back here and we'll all be doing  Dutch clutch all day long.  Dutch clutch all day long.  No, we got to do it together.  Let's just practice that part, okay?  On three, Dutch clutch.  No, but there's a slight pause.  The hands turn in and then it's all day long. 
[02:56:30]  You got it?  One, two, three.  Dutch clutch all day long.  All right, now we'll try it with a poem.  Okay.  Let me pick a...  All right, well, this is more of a song.  And at the end, we do the thing.  Row, row, row, you cunt gently down my prick.  Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily.  Then you'll suck my dick.  Dutch clutch all day long.  It's the O&A virus. 
[02:57:00]  XM 202.  XM news, talk, sports, and information.  It's everything all the time.  Aw, it's so cute.  Whoopsie-daisy.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Asses like ten-year-old boys.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Oh, Black Betty, bam-a-lam.  Yeah, Black Betty, bam-a-lam. 
[02:57:30]  Black Betty had a child, bam-a-lam.  Damn thing gone wild, bam-a-lam.  She's always with her, bam-a-lam.  She's on Rock City, bam-a-lam.  Whoa, Black Betty, bam-a-lam.  Yeah, Black Betty, bam-a-lam.  I love that version of Black Betty.  Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.  Yeah.  The original was by Ram Jam.  Who does that?  Oh, no, no, no.  The original was by Lead Belly.  Or even before him.  Oh.  I got Lead Belly singing.  Lead Belly.  Wow, really? 
[02:58:00]  Yes.  I never knew that.  I got Lead Belly singing a bunch of songs.  How do you know that?  How do you know about Lead Belly?  Lead Belly is...  Hope turned me on to him, to be very honest.  I know who Lead Belly is, but I'm surprised that Jim...  That Lead Belly CD I turned you on to, there's a version of that on there?  Well, you didn't turn me on to his CD, you turned me on to the song.  Well, that Kurt did, on Unplugged.  Where Did You Sleep Last Night is an old Lead Belly song.  I don't even know if it's Lead Belly's or it might even be before him.  That's true, too.  How many covers of that song?  I don't know, Lead Belly goes...  Spider Bait.  Huh?  Spider Bait is the band.  Yeah, that's a great version of Black Betty.  Anyway. 
[02:58:30]  All right.  We're back.  It's the O&A show.  It's the O&A Viber spreading across America.  We have Tom Brokaw audio, which is pretty funny because he's trying to say Bin Laden and...  He has such a tough time saying Osama Bin Laden.  He has that L thing that, you know, some people have, it's a certain type of lisp.  Right.  And you would think if you were going to get the guy to anchor your news and be the head  muckety-muck of all your news at NBC, it wouldn't be a guy with a lisp. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah.  But they've had him in there for years.  He's actually about to retire, Opie.  How about hiring a guy without a tumor on the side of his tongue?  And with the nightly news, Tom Brokaw can't say Bin Laden.  Comes out like blood clot when he says it.  Osama blood clot.  We'll get to that in a second.  We have to read this email from the donkey sausage girl.  Oh, here it is.  Donkey sausage.  Well, we met donkey sausage.  She called in from a radio shack and she said she was really, really hot and she wanted 
[02:59:30]  to come in for a lesbian for a day.  And what?  What's up, Ben?  Oh, okay.  And so she came in Friday, which was a stellar show.  Yeah.  We got some video clips up on foundrymusic.com.  It was our first lesbian for a day.  Sexy estate tryout is on the phone, though.  Oh, my God.  Well, now we have to immediately go there.  Yeah, you can't blow off sexy estate tryouts ever.  Well, this just ends.  Sexy estate tryout.  Oh, my God.  We got three things to do.  Tell Dee Schneider we can't talk to him today.  Dee's out.  Dee's out. 
[03:00:00]  Dee's out.  Dee's out.  Rebook him.  We got too much going on.  Rebook Dee.  I love this new show.  We got actual stuff that we can do.  All right.  Sexy estate in America, Anthony.  Then we'll do Donkey Sausage.  Then we'll do the Tom Brokaw.  And then we're going to go back to more audio from the Halloween parade down in the village.  All right.  So, sexiest estate in America.  We're looking for the sexiest estate.  It started with Illinois.  Yeah.  Illinois was holding the title for at least two weeks, I believe.  Just about.  Yeah.  And then what happened in the studio on Friday. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, for all those people that turned on their radios yesterday, you missed a great, great  one on Friday.  Oh, my God.  Just think about that.  There are people that subscribed, got our show over the weekend, and completely missed  Friday's show.  Which was unbelievable.  Our first lesbian thing in the new studio.  Bang up lipstick lesbian dyke fest.  It was fantastic.  With a purple dildo vibrator thing.  Oh, a lot of licking and sucking.  It was awesome.  Yes, it was.  Absolutely awesome.  And then one of the girls took the wiffle ball bat challenge. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, that's right.  The first one here.  And there it is.  Look at that mark on the bat.  Wow.  That is a proud mark up there.  Because I was reading email over the weekend.  What is that?  Six and three quarters?  Six and three quarter inches.  But she took the hitting end of the bat.  Yeah.  And I was thinking, too, when I was reading the email, like, that's not that impressive.  But you see it from a distance.  Holy crap.  It really is.  And you've got to figure, you know, that thing's pretty wide around.  So it's kind of stretching it out. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, that's impressive.  Anyone who feels it's not impressive, come down here.  We'll shove it up your ass.  You'll see.  We'll see how impressive it is.  Oh, the boys should have taken the wiffle ball bat down to the village last night.  Probably could have done the wiffle ball bat challenge.  Yeah.  Sure.  We'd have marks all the way to the middle of that bat.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Anyway, so we decided that after Friday's show is the hottest thing we've done so far  on Satellite Radio, that there's a new leader in the sexiest state in America. 
[03:02:00]  And at first we thought it was New York because it was done in the New York studios.  But Taylor Law, L-A-W-E, I believe, because a lot of people are looking for her website.  Uh-huh.  She's from the Philly area.  Oh.  So Pennsylvania is now officially the sexiest state in America.  We, um, wait a minute.  We actually, we accepted that?  You have to.  I thought it was over the phone.  Huh?  Didn't we make a rule where it had to be over the phone?  Really?  Yeah.  That's kind of a live appearance on the show.  Then every time we have a girl come in here and do something, New York is going to be like the... 
[03:02:30]  We need a ruling.  Did you update the sexiest state in America promo?  No, not yet.  Not yet.  I really feel...  Anthony is bringing up a fine point here.  I believe it should only be over the phone with our listeners and not a guest of the show  that comes in here to perform some kind of a sex act.  Well, it's certainly valid she wasn't in Pennsylvania when the act occurred.  Well, no, I guess the rule is it's that the sexiest state in America has to be done over the phone.  Just listeners over the phone. 
[03:03:00]  All right.  So you don't have to update the promo.  Okay.  There we go.  You got it.  All right.  It's still...  Less work, Steve.  Really hot audio, though.  More gooder.  And they're already selling that show as well as the first month of shows that we've done  here at XM Satellite Radio on eBay.  Oh, fantastic.  They're already pre-selling this week of shows.  We haven't even done anything yet.  Buy in advance.  Not yet released.  They're pretty much selling dead air.  Will be shipped to you when available.  It's an empty canvas.  They're already going, hey, get the second month of Opium Anthony at XM Satellite Radio now.  But we haven't done anything yet. 
[03:03:30]  All right.  So what happened?  Oh, boy.  We just set up Sexy State in America, and they're gone now.  Did we take too long to get to them?  What?  With all our yapping?  They're gone?  All right.  We'll call them back.  All right.  So where were we?  Now we got to ping pong back to something we were doing until they call back.  And our short-term memories are awful.  I think we were talking about Donkey Sausage Chick.  Oh, yeah.  Donkey Sausage Chick.  So we met her. 
[03:04:00]  She was the Radio Shack Chick that ran around screaming Donkey Sausage.  And then she faked her orgasm.  We got that out of her.  Yeah.  And then she came down to be lesbian for a day, and she was dressed up nice for Halloween.  She's a Puerto Rican girl that does an awful Rosie Perez.  She had black angel wings on and very hot.  I think her pictures are up on foundrymusic.com.  And we had Taylor and Mia from Philly.  And I guess we could tell Raquel this now, because I know she listens every day.  They didn't find her attractive at all. 
[03:04:30]  No.  They did not find her attractive at all.  And they pretty much told us behind the scenes that they would rather not have anything to do with Raquel.  Right.  All right.  Taylor wanted to have fun with Mia, the other blonde.  And that was what they did.  And that's what they did.  And it didn't involve Raquel at all.  So Raquel was sitting in the corner for most of that bit trying to get attention because she was bummed out.  No one was paying attention to her hotness.  And she was hot.  She wasn't as hot as Taylor and Mia, but she was hot.  She had something going on.  I was paying attention to her, and she was blowing me off. 
[03:05:00]  So I was like that.  Oh, you got really pissed off because she dissed you.  I believe Jim called her what?  What was the word you used?  Cocktease?  Yes, cocktease was the word.  All right.  Why was she a cocktease?  Any girl that talks to Jim, even says hello on the street, and doesn't have sex with him, is a cocktease.  That's what I've known.  Raquel is included.  No, but I'll say.  Wait.  How many emails did she send?  No, no.  Here's what it is.  This is one she sent to me, which I forgot she sent to me.  And then I'm reading this.  It says, I wrote you an email. 
[03:05:30]  You could tell him he could share it with you.  And I'm like, I think I still have it saved.  So I'm like, oh, yeah.  And I just printed it out.  I don't know if it's of any value or not.  Which one is first?  She sent me this one.  But I don't know which one.  Oh, she must have sent me the one first.  Let me see.  Wait.  There's 11-1.  10-29 she sent.  Sucking so bad.  10-29.  What emails is she going to send?  One to me, one to Steve.  All right.  Which one should we read?  The one to you?  No, whichever one you want.  I don't know which one's better.  I just printed it out to have it.  I know.  But now you're confused the issue.  Oh, okay.  I didn't mean to.  Because I read this one.  It was pretty good.  Let's read this one. 
[03:06:00]  Anthony?  What?  All right.  We'll read the one.  I'm screening this one really quick, scanning it.  And it looks pretty good, too.  She's out of her mind, is what she is.  All right.  Here we go.  So, Raquel, I'm not going to use her real name, although I would love to at this point.  And she wrote Jimmy after the show, after her appearance on the show, right?  Mm-hmm.  She writes, sorry, sorry, sorry.  I feel like such a huge failure.  I totally froze up.  Dude, I'm effing whacked.  I could have done nine inches on that sorry excuse for a wiffle ball bat. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, could have, should have, would have.  Yep.  That's all I'm hearing from her.  That's all.  Dude, there was another end of the bat.  She never even suggested that.  We'd have gone out and brought you a brand new bat if you didn't want to use one that  she, there was.  And that would have been great competition.  All of a sudden, Taylor takes six and three quarters or whatever the official measurement  was, and then Raquel steps up to the plate and say, I could do better?  Well, Raquel wouldn't get naked.  Right.  Yeah, she was all talk.  All talk, no action.  Yeah, for future sluts that are going to come on our show, if you're all talk, no action, 
[03:07:00]  stay home, please.  Yeah.  This is the real deal now with Satellite Radio.  You know, we can't waste our time with girls that say that they're going to do all sorts  of crazy stuff and then come in and don't do anything.  Please don't waste our time.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm so angry with myself and kicking myself for ever mentioning that I work for Radio Shack.  If I hadn't said that, I would have raped that sorry excuse for a lesbian, Taylor, with  her snotty attitude.  Oh, boy.  She's got a problem with the porn star, Taylor.  That sorry excuse for a lesbian. 
[03:07:30]  I've never seen better lesbianism in my life than what was going on.  I've got to agree with you.  I've got to agree.  Great stuff.  And Taylor is really hot.  I'll say.  They licked.  They sucked.  They put stuff in.  You can't lose.  I haven't whacked my bag, and this is honest to God's truth, to anybody alive as much as  I've whacked my bag to Taylor in the last three years.  Hey, there you go.  A ringing endorsement.  That's a great endorsement.  She's got a new DVD out, too.  Yes, Erotic Film Girls.  I think it's linked to Foundry Music.  Yes, Steve's nodding his head.  Foundrymusic.com.  You're a smut source. 
[03:08:00]  I don't know about you, but when people give off negative energy or look at you like you're  a worthless, dirty spick, you kind of get discouraged from wanting to make out with them.  Oh, boy.  See, this is a little bit of a self-hating thing going on here.  See, but I said earlier, I mean, Raquel is definitely a good-looking girl.  Oh, yeah.  She's definitely not.  But there was no chemistry.  Taylor didn't want anything to do with her.  That's all.  That's what you were seeing.  She was petrified.  She's like, no.  And I'll tell you what.  Because she has morals as well.  What?  I'll tell you what.  Morals, what?  I'll tell you what you're missing. 
[03:08:30]  Who has morals?  This is what you're missing.  Taylor's a porn star.  It's what she does.  It's what she's done.  And porn stars, despite what people say about them, are AIDS paranoid.  Right.  So they don't want to mess around unless you have a test.  You have to have a test that is recent.  So a lot of them are probably more likely to make out with another girl they know.  Of course.  Who they know is clean.  That's all that's about.  Yeah.  If Taylor didn't do porn, she probably wouldn't have thought so much.  But these girls are drilled into them.  AIDS test, AIDS test.  So you don't have one, they don't fool around you.  Real fast.  Lady Di, what's up?  Hey, how you doing? 
[03:09:00]  Shut up.  O and A.  How's everything?  From Taylor.  We're talking about Taylor and then you.  Come on.  Boy, you can really ruin anything.  Oh, will you stop it already, Jim?  What are you calling for?  To say what?  Yeah, this must be very important if you have to call on the air.  We're interrupting a lesbian email here.  An on-the-air phone call from Lady Di must be very important.  Lady Di, what do you have for the show?  No, no, no.  Marion got satellite radio.  Hello?  Hello?  I knew this was going to happen.  See?  They all know about me. 
[03:09:30]  Hello?  Okay.  Oh, my God.  She was all out of breath from picking up the receiver.  Wait, we didn't hang up on you.  There was obviously a problem.  Call back.  Nobody hung up on you, stupid.  We were just shocked that we found out you guys finally got the satellite radio.  I mean, the whole studio, Marion got satellite radio.  I mean, the listeners are probably pulling over.  We were looking at each other going, oh, my God.  You know something? 
[03:10:00]  I bet everyone listening is going to remember exactly where they were when they heard Marion  got satellite radio.  Absolutely.  It's one of those moments in history.  Kennedy being shot, man on the moon, Marion got satellite radio.  I couldn't see the radio because it was hidden behind the Stemmons freeway sign, but  I knew she had it.  I was going to say, hit him behind the case of beer that Lady Di's got in front of her  right now for breakfast.  Okay.  So you kind of get discouraged from wanting to make out with them.  Okay.  If you're interested, this is what happened before we entered. 
[03:10:30]  Skip over if you don't feel like bothering.  Steve walks over to the ugly versions of Jessica and Ashley Simpson.  Now, she's calling the two fine young lesbians we had in here the ugly versions of Jessica  and Ashley Simpson.  Wow.  Wow.  Point over to me and says that I'm the lessee virgin that needs to be broken in.  The chick's hubby, or whoever he was, says to myself and the other ladies that since  I was dressed up in Dom gear, that I should either use the drill dough on them or F them  with a strap on. 
[03:11:00]  Shit.  I got wet just thinking about it.  I was all game then.  I see this look.  Not sure if it was before or after Steve mentioned that I was a fiery Latina vixen or that her  man got wood from taking multiple pics of me.  Whatever the case was, she said no.  She knew that she only wanted her ugly bitch friend to play.  And I have to say, I was disappointed and felt like a complete tool just watching and  not doing anything.  Mia was not ugly.  No.  This is almost sociopathic in its lack of ability to analyze what happened.  Right, right. 
[03:11:30]  There's a complete lack of any understanding as to what was happening in the studio, the  whole vibe that was going on.  Hinkley had a better grasp on his Jodie Foster relationship.  And she does with what was happening between her and those girls and the girls with each  other.  The guy who takes pictures of Taylor was not jealous.  And Taylor was not jealous.  It just doesn't make sense.  All right.  For being a porn star, she fucking sucked.  What kind of filthy whore turns out a nice, clean girl like me?  How is she supposed to know you don't have the hiv? 
[03:12:00]  Absolutely.  Especially after she saw you and I talking.  Right.  Could have been freshly given to you.  Anyhow, sorry about ranting.  You might have it, by the way, just from talking to Jim.  Anyhow, sorry about ranting, but I figured that you would understand.  Wait, you forgot to put in the, you didn't read what was in parentheses.  Oh, that's an important one.  Cleanliness is next to godliness.  That's what she writes.  Five exclamation points.  Five exclamation points.  That's right.  Important, important information when inserting a wiffle ball back.  Anyhow, sorry about ranting, but I figured that you would understand that I don't think 
[03:12:30]  O and A were prepared for a girl like me.  Oh, okay.  Now, hold on right now.  Slow down.  You could slow down right there.  You have this way inflated image of yourself, first of all.  Aren't ready for a girl like you?  Do you know the types of fucking lunatics we've had to deal with in the studio over  the past ten years that me and Opie have been doing this program?  Ten years.  You're not even a fly on the wall over some of the nutcase, slutbag bitches we've had 
[03:13:00]  in the studio.  I had a girl wrapped up in Christmas lights punch me in the face.  I got in a fight with a girl.  That was in the studio doing poetry and when I commented on her poetry, she leaned over  and punched me in the face and started kicking my ass and she was nude, nothing but Christmas  lights on her body.  And that's one of the girls I really had to dredge up out of my memory.  There's others, honey.  Believe me, not ready for a girl like you?  You were one of the dime a dozen girls that passed through here with this overinflated image 
[03:13:30]  of what you did for the show.  You did nothing.  And as a matter of fact, it's kind of a tribute to maybe that you were kind of good looking,  the fact that we didn't throw your ass out of you for talking on the mic every two fucking  seconds.  I was reading the instant feedback.  I saw the phone calls.  They didn't like you.  The audience did not like you.  You were commenting and talking over people's jokes.  You were adding nothing to the program.  And if you wanted to step up, how about instead of commenting how you wanted to give the girl 
[03:14:00]  the drill, though, how about you take it?  You didn't want to do anything.  Wow.  Good boy.  Good rant, Anthony.  I forgot about the poetry girl.  She beat me up.  I know she did.  It was great.  There were so many of those.  It was great radio.  Not ready for that?  The girl leaned over.  I lit a bottle rocket and it flew out of her cunt.  How the hell did you get...  What are you doing?  We're not ready for you.  We're not ready for you?  We built a shield so a girl wouldn't get her pussy burned.  Go use the snatch as a rocket launcher. 
[03:14:30]  Right, you idiot.  Now, that's a memorable girl that we were maybe not ready for, Opie.  Right.  What about the girl that could throw eggs from her vag?  A girl was throwing eggs at a blind guy out of her vagina.  Not using her hands, but we're not ready for you.  That I can say maybe I wasn't ready to see.  You sprayed a girl with pig's blood.  Yeah, there you go.  We loaded up super soakers, two of them, with pig blood, swine blood.  Stripped her naked and sprayed her down until she looked like the end of Carrie. 
[03:15:00]  Part of the 55-gallon drum challenge, we had to get a stretcher up to the 10th floor  and they had to take the girl out on a stretcher completely nude and filled with, you know,  covered with filth.  Oh my God, that's right.  Because a live cricket had crawled into her ear and couldn't get out.  You remember that chick, Cinder Moon, that sat on top of the big Tesla coil,  ran all those volts of electricity through her body?  There you go.  And then you guys ragged on her because it wasn't impressive enough  and she broke down crying in the bathroom?  Right.  Yeah. 
[03:15:30]  There you go.  Raquel, we're not ready for you.  Are you kidding me?  We're not ready for you?  If we weren't ready for you, how would we possibly be ready for a girl  that took a cell phone up her vagina and we called it  to see if we could get a signal in her womb?  Now that's something maybe I wasn't ready to see.  Montana Gunn had an ice cube in her asshole and it popped out in my hand  and I threw it in my mouth.  You wouldn't even rub your knuckles on my mule.  And let's see.  Wait, she's O and A weren't prepared for a girl like me. 
[03:16:00]  Exclamation point.  Raquel.  What's up?  What's up?  Are you insane writing these emails?  You're a crazy person.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Before I even go on, how long have I been listening to the show?  For a very long time.  Do I know exactly what to say to get you guys worked up  and have plenty of shit to fucking argue about?  Absolutely.  So I don't mind you ragging on me.  Absolutely.  Yeah, I am fucking nuts.  I'm crazy.  Here's the problem, because I like you,  but you're coming off as arrogant.  And that's the problem.  You're not coming off going, 
[03:16:30]  hey, I froze up a little bit.  That's not a big deal if you freeze up.  It happens.  No big deal.  I did.  I did.  I did.  I did choke up.  But you're coming off acting like,  oh, and I couldn't handle you.  No, no, I didn't mean it like that.  I just meant that, you know.  I was being polite.  There was a time I made a hardcore dominatrix run out of the studio crying.  We can't handle you?  What do you mean by,  I don't think O&A were prepared for a girl like me?  I know you're a very bright girl, right?  I'm very talkative.  I'm very talkative.  All women are.  We've had that.  Did you just hear that mutant lady die? 
[03:17:00]  If I wanted to talkative.  If I wanted to talk, I'd go home.  We don't need girls talking in this studio.  We need girls doing what every guy wants them to do.  Have lesbian experiences.  This is our fantasy world right here.  We don't need girls talking.  That's the last thing we need.  How many girls do you hear talking on this show,  telling us some interesting point about a subject?  Not often.  Not often.  So we should read the rest of the email. 
[03:17:30]  I say absolutely we should read the rest of the email.  This is actually the one you wrote to me.  I'm a very tough bitch.  I am far from shy.  And honestly, I would have grabbed your mule  talking about Jim Norton in front of everyone  if it weren't for the fear of Opie saying,  ooh, the Radio Shack girl is grabbing Jimmy's knob.  What would be the problem if I yelled that out  if you were grabbing his mule?  Because there's a lot of people listening.  And I didn't care that you didn't anyway.  So you weren't here for that.  That's fine.  She didn't want her boyfriend knowing that she's cheating on him.  But she actually didn't grab it. 
[03:18:00]  That wasn't what you were here for.  That was killing me.  I actually am stepping down from the big store I have now  to the one I got promoted from  so I can have more time to myself.  But blabbing my mouth off on O&A was certainly a good start.  Laugh.  LOL.  LOL.  LOL.  Chuckle, chuckle.  Other than the stupid fake Lesleys, I had a great time.  Lesleys?  Wait a minute.  What was fake about the lesbians?  How was that fake Lesley?  They ate each other's pussies.  No, I know, I know, I know.  This is my thing with them, all right?  Like, they kept on giving, okay, I understand that they're porn stars, so yeah, they don't 
[03:18:30]  want to play around with girls that they don't know that are tested, blah, blah, blah, whatever.  But there was no need for the dirty looks.  There were no need for that.  So, you know, I get over angry.  They didn't like you.  That's fine.  So they didn't have to give me dirty looks.  I was more than polite to them.  They just didn't like you.  And I didn't want to bring that up on the air, because, you know, we didn't know you,  so I'm like, whatever.  This is the new kind Leropi.  I didn't want to, like, you know, put you in a bad spot.  Kinder.  Kinder.  I've always been kind. 
[03:19:00]  All right, so other than the stupid fake Lesleys, I had a great time.  It was an absolute pleasure meeting you and think that you and I could corrupt a few more  innocent people out there.  You are effing cool, and I would be honored to be able to hang with you sometime.  You said you live or are from Jersey, right?  I'm semi-hosting a stripper Halloween party with myself as a star.  Of course, you as a star.  And I'm recruiting a few young whores to play as well.  Don't know how you feel about hanging out with strangers, but you are more than welcome  to join the fun, and maybe we could F with a few people's heads and cause them some serious 
[03:19:30]  mental anguish or a serious complex.  Did you show up, Jimmy?  No, I couldn't, because I don't like head games.  Feel free to give me a call, and forgive me if it sounds like I'm bitching, because I'm  not that flowery of a chick.  Again, it was awesome finally meeting some decent people.  You and the guys, that is, and anytime you guys are up to some shenanigans and you want  a hot chick to take part, count me in.  Oh, what?  You got hot friends?  Yeah.  I do.  Count me in.  I was thinking maybe I could round up a bunch of my hot friends and we could do an amateur 
[03:20:00]  stripper contest, giving you lap dances and you picking the winner.  You know, good old American fun.  Talk to you soon.  Real name.  P.S.  I'm so sorry.  Tell the guys I said sorry, too.  I'm a lot more fun than that.  I really want to F a girl.  I don't know, man.  I think you're all talk.  Sure.  You know.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You did like us, though, right?  I did.  I think you guys are great. 
[03:20:30]  Then why were you calling them assholes when you were walking out of the building?  Oh, who is this now?  Our intern.  What's his name?  What's your name?  I'm Derek.  Hi, Derek.  Oh, that's Derek.  I know all the intern's names.  That's Derek.  Is this your first date?  No.  Oh, no.  He's been doing a great job running the board.  Oh.  What was I calling you guys assholes?  Who you guys are?  According to Derek, our intern, you were like bad-mouthing us after the show.  No, no, no.  Not bad-mouthing you guys.  You guys are assholes.  Everybody's an asshole.  I'm an asshole.  Oh, boy.  The typical manner of the show. 
[03:21:00]  Stop whining.  On Ray.  This fucking pig.  Oh, my God.  You guys give this pig a chance to come on the air.  Oh, shut up.  Listen to me, you little slut.  You're lucky you call the show.  Okay, listen.  You little typical Latina.  Oh, my God.  It's unbelievable with this girl.  You give her the chance to come on the air.  The porn stars think she's a pig because she is a pig.  I saw the pictures.  Nothing special.  You work at a radio shack.  You may as well work at a fucking A&P. 
[03:21:30]  You're worthless pig.  On Ray.  You guys will be stocking milk.  Work at a radio shack.  Come on the air.  These guys give you a chance.  And you do nothing but complain because people don't find you attractive because you are not.  All right, On Ray.  You warned.  On Ray made her hang up.  Yeah, she hung up, man.  Well, she should hang up because she's a pig.  All right.  Unbelievable.  You actually give her the chance and she complains.  Okay?  So that's all.  I have nothing more to say.  I'm the new Frenchie.  Goodbye.  All right.  Yeah.  And another stellar phone call for the new Frenchie. 
[03:22:00]  Raquel should have hung up, though, because in one breath you're saying, like, they're not  ready for a girl like you because you're very, like, ballsy and talkative.  Well, there's a chance a guy's come up to give you a trashing.  No one was going to cut you off, Raquel.  You could have trashed him back.  Turned around and bashed him right back.  Show some of the balls that she says she has.  Bashed him in his pseudo-French face.  We deliver keggers.  Yep.  What's that, Ove?  I don't know what that means.  Now, there's a second email.  But over the phone, I want to get back to the cell phone call.  She was saying that we're assholes. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah, she was walking behind me as I was leaving the building and she was, I guess,  calling her boyfriend and she was like, God, those guys are such assholes.  I can't believe it.  And it wasn't in a fun way.  Like, I would sit there and say, oh, Jimmy, I love when he goofs on that.  He's such an asshole.  You know, that's kind of a fun.  But, Ant, why would you?  Well, because you're an asshole.  No, she was being serious about it and then she sort of stormed off down the block when  she walked out of the building.  Yeah, so it was more of a serious, we're assholes.  Yeah.  Because we didn't sign her to a contract to be on our show, which I think she expected 
[03:23:00]  us to do.  She comes off in these emails like somebody that thinks a lot more of herself than she's  presenting to other people.  Well, who did she send this one to, Steve?  I believe the second one was to Steve and his big C.  All right.  So he wrote, she wrote Steve after writing Jimmy.  I wrote Jim an email about Friday.  Can you tell him I said he could share it with you?  Um, but I felt like I did badly because of the whole fake porn stars and all. 
[03:23:30]  They weren't fake porn stars.  I love that.  Yeah.  Fake lesbians out.  Fake porn star.  The one girl's thighs were shaking like jello.  Oh, she was so into it.  They're not fake.  If you didn't get along with them on a personality level.  That's one thing.  But I got stalactite on my ceiling that says that Taylor is not a fake porn star.  You're having a big mule in your mouth and going, uh-oh, I'd be gay if I wasn't faking  this.  Garg.  Garg.  How fake is it when it's happening right in front of your face?  Rock, they weren't fake porn stars.  Now you're pissing us off. 
[03:24:00]  What was fake about them?  Did you say or take...  No, no, no.  They went at it.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  So what are you talking about fake porn stars?  They took six and three quarters of the bat.  You wrote it.  Fake porn stars and all.  They both had orgasms.  Okay.  What did you mean by fake?  What's fake about them?  They got, uh, they, uh, the one, because the one is, uh, in porn and the other is just  her friend, has DVDs out.  I think Mia was a lot more attractive than Taylor.  There was just something about Taylor's mouth that was just really unattractive. 
[03:24:30]  You ever watch, let me play Devil's Advocate, you ever watch her give her a Hummer?  You ever watch her give her a Hummer?  Her mouth is a thing of art.  I break down and I get emotional when I think of her mouth.  I have a question.  Do you have a computer in front of you?  Uh, yeah.  Do you have a copy of the email you sent?  Um, probably yes.  Could you bring it up real quick?  Because if we're reading it, why don't you read it?  I mean, I'm just guessing that it would be better to have you read it.  Well, because, uh, I'm, I'm sitting.  Yeah, you could read it as Rosie Perez. 
[03:25:00]  What?  Jesus.  Quiet.  That's what this show needs.  Listeners doing impressions.  Awful.  That's great.  Wait, do you have a, can you, can you bring this up and read it under sent mail?  I'd rather not.  Could you argue back, um, at us as Rosie Perez?  Because she's, uh, she's a tough, uh, Latino chick.  No, she's not.  They're all soft.  Come on.  Could you at least yell bubbles and then throw your tool, your, uh, I can't remember  the word.  I suck.  What is it that she did in that movie? 
[03:25:30]  If I knew what the hell you were talking about.  You know, just the fact that I asked that.  I should be drummed out of fucking radio.  What is it that she did in that movie?  Fat-titted little non-recall nothing.  All right, here we go.  Let's get through this letter that she wrote to Steve.  I had a really hard time holding back my frustrations with them, the dirty looks I got from them  and the cold shoulder treat, but not to mention that they were effing ugly bitches to begin  with.  The fact that they had the audacity.  I wasn't attracted to them.  I wasn't attracted to them.  The fact that they had the audacity to give me a dirty look made me want to pimp-slap-the-white-off-them 
[03:26:00]  professional hoes.  They were by far the lamest lesbians I'd ever seen.  Lame lesbians?  And now, why was that lame?  You haven't answered this.  Why do you think that lesbianism was lame?  I don't know.  I just wasn't turned on by it.  I mean, I was kind of, you know, shocked that they were...  Andre.  Why do you hang up on me?  Why?  Because you're an ignorant person.  Yes, why?  I ask you why.  What?  Because I didn't feel like listening to you rent and rave and pretend like you're somebody  else and, you know...  Pretend that I'm somebody else.  No, because you know I tell the truth.  That's why you hang up on me. 
[03:26:30]  I did hang up on you.  That's why.  Because I tell the truth and I say it and you know it.  Hey, couples have problems, too.  And you have nothing to say.  I'm not having problems, too.  You have no defense.  Oh, poor guy who has to be with her.  No, that's why most guys can't...  Must try to kill himself nightly.  Does he have a rope hanging from his ceiling?  Does he have a rope hanging from his ceiling at all?  No, actually...  Does he have that or, you know, what?  Does he stand in front of traffic every day when you talk?  Absolutely.  Does he talk like Rosie Perez in bed, too? 
[03:27:00]  Is that how you do it?  No, not so much.  Not so much.  Does he vomit in the bed?  You two try to make terrible love, peak love?  Oof.  Yeah, Raquel, why don't you yell back at him as Rosie?  Yeah, let's hear that good impression again.  Come on.  I want to hear it.  No, not quite.  Not quite.  Okay.  Right.  I have nothing left.  You going to hang up again?  No, because I have nothing to say to you, because you're a worthless piece of shit with a fucked up accent.  You can't speak straight.  Okay.  Is it fucked up as the Rosie Perez impression, too?  Worse.  Worse than the Rosie Perez impression.  No classic.  Okay. 
[03:27:30]  I'm going to go look at your ugly pictures again online, you picked.  Oh, go for it.  Go for it.  That's great.  There goes the new Frenchie.  The new Frenchie.  I like the new Frenchie.  He knows when to punch out.  Yeah, he punches out.  He really is like a sniper.  All right, so you want to slap the white off them professional hoes.  They were by far the lamest lesbians I'd ever seen.  I was biting my tongue not to say anything about their lame performances, especially with  the wiffle ball bat challenge.  Six inches.  I thought that was lame.  I'm sorry.  You know what?  When you guys said, when you guys said wiffle ball bat challenge, I was expecting one of  those old wiffle ball bats that are fucking, like, seven or inches round, you know, that's 
[03:28:00]  a little one.  We want to have a little fun.  We don't want to kill the girl.  Well, and that's the wiffle ball bat.  It's not the wooden leg challenge.  There is no way you would top that mark.  That's the wiffle ball bat that we all grew up using.  What bat are you talking about?  The bat that hits you over the head when you were a kid?  No, no, no.  Not the big, monstrous one.  But then, you know, the regular bat.  It's like a regular bat, but it's yellow in plastic.  So, Raquel, just out of curiosity.  Why didn't you do it? 
[03:28:30]  I mean, it would have been cool if you did it.  There was condoms on the bat, so you wouldn't have had...  I know.  Especially the wiffle ball bat challenge.  Six inches, that's crap.  I could deep throat more than that.  Yes, I most definitely could.  You're all talk, no action.  I can't do anything.  Why?  Why can't you do anything?  Because, like I said, my job, so...  Then why...  Then...  This is why we didn't get you involved in the action.  Because we knew you weren't going to do anything.  But you had to keep on mentioning where I was confronted.  If only I had not mentioned the Radio Shack thing from the get-go, 
[03:29:00]  and people were not watching me,  that show would have gone in a much different direction.  Really?  Yes.  Really?  It would have...  Matter of fact, listen...  People are saying it was the best show we've ever done.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  You were going to make that...  How are you going to make that show that we all listen to Friday better?  I really need to hear this.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  No, no.  I said it would have went in a different direction.  I never said it would have been better.  I said it would have went in a different direction.  That show was great.  Valley was great.  The other stuff that happened was great.  I didn't knock that at all.  You guys were fucking fantastic, like you guys always are.  So I'm not negating that at all. 
[03:29:30]  I was all game on using the drill door on either one of them, pussies.  I was.  Definitely.  I wasn't afraid of them.  Why didn't you take the drill, though?  Because!  I also had no chance to get them to warm up to me, as I was telling Jim.  When it comes to my body and physical attributes, I'm pretty shy and humble.  I really don't think that I'm all that.  I really just said that in the beginning so you guys would want to meet me.  But when it comes to getting what I want, getting people to do what I want,  I own that in big letters.  I was telling Norton that I would love to come back and maybe help out once in a while. 
[03:30:00]  I think I could be of good use to the boys.  I can get girls to do whatever I want and get girls to do whatever I want.  And men, forget it.  I don't have to ask.  Let me tell you something.  We don't want women as part of our daily radio show.  Women on radio stink.  Absolutely stink.  Yeah.  All right?  Robin works for Howard.  She does nothing for that radio show.  Absolutely nothing.  Oh, stop.  She was hired back in the day when you couldn't be so racist and speak your mind. 
[03:30:30]  So Howard figured I'd get a black chick so I could do some black jokes and no one will yell and scream.  That's the only reason she's on that fucking show.  And I needed a shwoogie.  He needed a shwoogie and a laugh track.  That's it.  That's what girls are good for when it comes to radio.  That way he can make fun of fat.  Women on radio stink.  They're awful.  Name me one woman that did great on radio that wasn't doing a sex show. 
[03:31:00]  Marion?  Oh, Marion.  You know, by the way, she just got an XM satellite radio, Marion.  I know.  I saw some people from the Post circling outside.  I simply based it on my unbelievable skills of being a hustler, being reekin' and all.  It comes natural.  I'm convincing when I want to be.  I'm persuasive, aggressive, manipulative, charming, and occasionally I use my sex appeal.  Raquel, Raquel.  I got a woman.  Can I put one thing out?  You really want to be a part of this radio show.  I don't want to cut you.  Not really.  Yes, sir.  Raquel, Raquel.  Hold on. 
[03:31:30]  Jimmy's speaking.  Hold on, Raquel.  I just want to...  There's just a bit of a conflict here.  One sentence, I'm pretty shy and humble, and then three sentences down, I'm persuasive,  aggressive, manipulative, charming, and occasionally I use sex appeal.  That's a sociopathic...  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sociopathic.  So I'm sociopathic.  I'm just saying it is a bit inconsistent.  You have to admit.  All right.  Let me finish this up here.  I simply based it on...  Okay, we got that.  I use my sex appeal.  Bottom line is I know what it takes to get shit done.  Whether it's calming teen girls to do whatever you want to convince... 
[03:32:00]  To convincing cops, hire authorities, anyone to do as you please.  Trust me, I'm that good.  I should have been fired from the Radio Shack two years ago, let alone a week ago, but I'm  still here.  You want a position on this radio show.  No, no.  We're not hiring.  I'm looking at...  So if I was bad on Friday, it's with reason, nerves, stupid bitches with no play and big  attitudes, and I was a little intimidated by the boys, O&A.  But now I'm game.  And again, it was a great pleasure meeting you, Steve.  You are cool as hell, and it's great that you are the one running things. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah, right.  I wonder who said that on the phone.  I did not.  I did not.  I don't know.  I think Steve retyped this email to make himself look good.  I think he's running things.  Yeah.  I did not.  Holy crap.  He's walking around here with a fucking martini.  Steve, who should I talk to?  Well, technically, Ben is the producer, but I'm more than willing to step up into his  position.  It's really irritating when you do that.  Because I know Ben has been watching the Boston Red Sox for the last two weeks, so I'm  the boss now.  Ben comes in drunk and tired.  Steve wants your job, Ben.  Oh, my God. 
[03:33:00]  Holy crap.  You're delusional if you think Steve's running this show.  Yeah, thank you.  I, for the record, never, never said that.  Oh, my God.  Listen, listen, listen, listen, wait.  It's great that you're the one.  Shut up.  Hold on.  Oh, Steve, is it cool to move on?  Yeah, Steve, do you think we...  Can we move on?  Can I go?  I've got to go back to work.  Steve, please do.  Hold on.  Hold on.  No, no.  Go.  Hold on.  We're going to give you...  Martini Steve.  We're going to give you a chance here.  All right.  Really fast.  Okay, so Steve's running things.  I'd love to flood you with some great kinky-ass ideas that the guys would find historical. 
[03:33:30]  Please send those ideas to Steve.  And I will read them on the air with an open mind and see if you actually have what it takes.  So whenever you are in need of a chick with an imaginary dick...  What?  Why?  There's plenty of chicks with real ones.  Give me a call.  Thanks again, Steve.  You signed your real name.  I'll save that.  P.S.  Sorry to chew your ear off.  That's what attractive, intelligent women do.  Don't forget shy and humble.  Well, Raquel, I think it's time.  I think it's time to just walk away. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah.  The clock says...  I do.  I gotta walk away.  I gotta walk away.  The clock says 15 minutes.  It was nice.  Listen.  All I wanted is to give you plenty of material to fuck with.  So hey...  It was a good bit.  That was great.  It was a good bit.  The whole donkey sausage thing, you know?  Yeah.  Oh.  And there she goes.  Oh, and there she goes.  We lose another one, Anthony.  Thank God.  And she's one of these girls that, I don't know, has this image of themselves, and it's 
[03:34:30]  nothing like they really are.  She sees herself as this tough, hot Latina chick that's gonna come in here and woo all  of us, have us, hold us all in the palm of her hand, Opie, be able to work us, and  actually work and maybe even get a spot here on the show.  Yes.  But Rochelle, work us like a puppet on a string.  Another Pess of Byzante.  We didn't have enough time, Rochelle.  Just wasn't enough time. 
[03:35:00]  But she's got this image of herself, and it just isn't anything like real life.  It didn't work out.  Now she's portraying the letters that she sent as some kind of ploy to give us material.  Like, look how I helped you out.  Like, you know, like she spent her time thinking this up so we would have this break today.  No, I'm not buying that.  Maybe I could put a bat in my vagina.  You're out, Rochelle.  She's hot.  You know.  She's very hot. 
[03:35:30]  She's definitely hot.  Opie, can I run around and yell donkey sausage for old time's sake?  Sorry, Rochelle.  Can't do it, Rochelle.  Just walk away.  Your customers are waiting.  Go out to the car.  We'll drive you back to the Radio Shack.  The line forms here.  Take the gun.  Leave the shitty electronic product.  All right.  All right.  She likes saying a Hail Mary before she shoves a bat in there. 
[03:36:00]  We're not getting into everything today, huh?  Do we have more Halloween audio, or are we going to have to wait until tomorrow?  Wait until tomorrow.  All right.  We'll wait for you, Mom.  Rochelle's back on the phone.  Don't you do it!  Don't you!  I got nowhere else to go!  Oh.  I got nowhere else to go!  Really?  Yes?  Anything else?  I got inducted.  Yes?  I got nothing else.  Yeah.  Of course.  Sorry. 
[03:36:30]  Oof.  All right.  Our first sociopath.  I feel bad things worked out that way.  It's about time, man.  Our first lunatic of the new show.  Only took a month.  Okay.  Yeah, we're going to break, and we got Tom Brokaw audio and other things to get to, and  I don't know.  And that's that.  Ben?  I'm just coming in the studio.  Huh?  I'm just coming in the studio.  Oh.  No, I know.  I know.  I just think it's funny that Steve is trying to, you know.  I want to ask producer Steve.  I never, ever said that. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah.  Multinistee!  Look at Gravano trying to take over for Gotti.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  There's going to be a shootout.  No.  In the production room later.  All right.  Blah, blah, blah.  Get us out of here, man.  Come on!  Check this out!  Raw!  Raw!  I kick it.  In the hizzy.  I kick it old schoolie.  Duh!  Word up.  Hey, jerk face.  Hey, jerk face.  You feel me? 
[03:37:30]  Waka, waka, waka.  Poop that bitch.  How much ass does that kick?  Sexy.  How much ass does that kick?  Sexy.  East side.  Booty.  Let's do it.  Booty.  Booty.  These boobs rock.  Judge.  Is anyone menstruated?  My nipples are hard just thinking about it.  Has everybody gone crazy?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,  stab you, Jack Slater.  G.O.P. and Anthony Show.  I found out recently that when a wife gets mad, she spells. 
[03:38:00]  Last week she was mad at me.  She said to me, I said, no.  N.O.  No.  And tonight she was mad again.  She said, tonight we're eating out.  O.U.T.  Out.  I thought to myself, that's progress, you know.  I mean, in one week she went from a two-letter word to a three-letter word, you know.  And whenever we get out, we get stuck, you know.  You know, we look for bargains.  You know those restaurants where you pay so much, you eat all you want? 
[03:38:30]  We got stuck again.  We got a seafood restaurant.  The sign says, seafood, all you want, a buck and a quarter.  It was like going fishing, you know.  I mean, for a half hour we ate bait.  I mean, I'll tell you, I'm not so fond of seafood restaurants anyway, you know.  I mean, they got no originality. 
[03:39:00]  They all got the same sign.  The fish you eat today slept last night in Chesapeake Bay.  I'll tell you, when I, when I own a fish, I mean, I'm only interested in how it's prepared.  I don't care where the fish slept.  If it slept, who it slept with, it makes no difference to me.  In fact, I think a fish will taste much better if it was bad morally. 
[03:39:30]  That's how I feel in my life, you know.  You know, another thing I don't like when you eat out is when they get busy, you got to split a table with someone.  I never get lucky, like a pretty girl or something.  I always get a loser.  The other night I ate out and they got busy.  I had to split a table.  They sat down an old man, you know.  Must have been in his 80s.  This guy was old.  I mean, I asked him to pass me the salt and pepper.  He had to make two trips. 
[03:40:00]  And everything I ordered, he told me, was bad for me.  The whole meal, all I heard was, you're young, you're lame, you're young, you're young.  I ordered a baked potato.  He said, you already had your carbohydrates.  Then he got angry when I left over the skin.  He said, all the vitamins and minerals are in the skin.  I said, look, let me alone, will you?  I didn't even want a baked potato. 
[03:40:30]  If you weren't here, I would have had French fries.  Well, now, I'll tell you, the restaurants are going to be the most trouble, the real classy ones, you know.  I took my wife out a few weeks ago.  I wanted to show her a good time.  I took her to a French restaurant over the east side.  Didn't work out at all.  I mean, these classy restaurants, someone is always looking for you to give them something, you know.  As soon as I sat down, a guy came over with a violin.  I mean, I was hungry.  I had to sit there and listen to Musetta's warts. 
[03:41:00]  Then I couldn't figure out who my waiter was.  One guy took my order.  Another guy wheeled it out.  Another guy served it.  And another guy, well, he just kept putting down butter.  On a whole meal, I couldn't relax.  They all kept hanging around watching me.  Every time I looked up, one of them leaped at me.  Yes, sir.  I said, I don't want to.  I'm just looking.  What do you want from me, huh?  No way out. 
[03:41:30]  They were all waiting for me and smiling, you know.  The guy who wheeled it out was smiling.  The guy who served it was smiling.  The guy with the butter was smiling.  And Musetta's waltz was there, too.  Him, I wanted to walk right by, you know.  I mean, I didn't ask for no violin.  My wife said it isn't right.  She got to give him something, you know.  So I booked him at a bar mitzvah.  I've got stupid in stereo. 
[03:42:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Word up.  Everybody say.  When you hear the call, you got to get it underway.  Word up.  All right, now.  It's the good word.  No matter what you say it, you know that you'll be like.  You're tuned in to The Opie and Anthony Show.  On high voltage, 202.  Whatever the hell that means.  It is the ONA virus. 
[03:42:30]  This channel should be called the virus.  The ONA virus.  Spreading across America slowly but surely.  Well, high voltage is a good name because it hides who's on it.  High voltage means that when they hired us, they didn't really know what we were all about.  They wanted to go with the whole shock jock angle.  High voltage.  Shock.  Shocking.  Maybe.  We're more than that.  We're so much more than that.  Ah, let's see.  We didn't get to half the stuff today, man.  We want to talk about the Black Honeymooners. 
[03:43:00]  The paper's talking that JFK had sex at age 17 in a whorehouse in Harlem, according to a new book, I guess.  I like big butts and I cannot lie.  Was it an African-American chick?  It was Harlem.  But it was Harlem back then.  Who knows?  It was Harlem in the...  What year?  Was it like the old one when...  Wait, he died in 63 and he was 44? 
[03:43:30]  No.  No?  Yeah.  40...  I have no idea.  40-something?  Was it back in the old days of the Cotton Club?  I believe he was born around 1920, so 1937?  My mother lived in Harlem back then.  Really?  Well, 39 she was born, but in the 40s...  Yeah, in the 40s she lived in Harlem and said it was all Italian and Irish up in Harlem back then.  Look at us not knowing.  And then, you know, Italian and Irish.  Oh, then there goes the neighborhood, you know? 
[03:44:00]  But they said it was a different time back then, so perhaps it was a white chick.  All right, well, then it's not a fun story.  No.  A little scrape.  All right, we took care of that.  Black Honeymooners, we've got to say that for tomorrow because that's just too funny.  And we also have, Anthony, some Tom Brokaw audio.  Yeah, this poor guy.  He's retiring soon.  Yeah.  But, I mean, for years and years, the guy just can't talk. 
[03:44:30]  I've tried to watch his newscast, but you get all nervous for him because he's trying so hard to make these words come out right  that he actually gets out of breath.  At the end of his sentence, he just, well, who will take some of these swing states?  We're looking at the map.  You can see the red states and the blue states.  And, of course, the campaign's been undecided.  Some of these people will go to the polls still undecided, not knowing who they're going to be. 
[03:45:00]  Like, what the?  Come on, breathe.  Breathe, Tom.  You do get uncomfortable listening to him.  It's uncomfortable.  You watch, and I'm wincing.  I wince when he's trying to talk.  Because we used to make fun of the fact that he can't say his L's, but you're right.  His L's are a win thing.  The new thing is he does run out of breath.  He runs out of breath as he's trying to squeeze his legs.  I'm hearing my iron lung trying to breathe.  The president election. 
[03:45:30]  So we got some examples.  Yeah, just listen to this poor guy.  That's my music.  This is NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw.  Now batting.  Reporting tonight from NBC News election headquarters on Democracy Plaza.  Good evening.  Tonight, Osama bin Laden has a message for America just four days before this country votes in a presidential election that has been fought bitterly over the issue of terrorism, the war in Iraq, and, yes, the best way to deal with Osama bin Laden, the mastermind behind the attacks of 9-11. 
[03:46:00]  Osama bin Laden's tape was first broadcast on the Arab language channel Al Jazeera, and while it contains no specific news threat, it raises big questions about the political impact in this country, and both campaigns were quick to answer him.  Osama bin Laden.  It just seems like a struggle. 
[03:46:30]  Osama bin Laden.  Like the back of his throat, his tongue, the roof of his mouth, and his teeth are in a battle.  A battle royal.  Just trying to throw each other out of his mouth.  I'm trying to keep it together and keep all these things moving in my mouth, and it's very difficult.  Especially with words like Osama bin Laden and Al Jazeera.  Can I just call Al Jazeera Al?  Like he's a friend of mine.  Hey, I was speaking with Al the other day, and they had Osama bin Laden. 
[03:47:00]  Osama.  You know the bad guy?  Can I just call him that bad guy?  Because this is a lot of work for my mouth.  Oh, God.  Oh.  You make a good point today.  Coming as this did, heading into the final weekend of the election, both campaigns immediately responded to bin Laden's message with strong messages of their own.  We'll begin with that part of the story tonight with NBC's David Gregory, who's traveling with the president in Ohio.  David?  Who's traveling with the president?  Yeah, it's like traveling with the president. 
[03:47:30]  It's very difficult.  It's like trying to recite the preamble of the Constitution with a mouthful of jujubes.  We are the people of the United States of America in order for a more perfect union.  He can't speak.  Senator Kerry, for his part, spent the day in Florida.  NBC's Carl Quintanilla is traveling with him tonight.  Carl, what's the latest there?  Carl, what's the latest there?  Traveling so far? 
[03:48:00]  Far?  What is far?  She's state.  It's very important to the election.  He's doing the coverage.  She's traveling to Florida, which I believe is just south of Zurich.  If you go a little west, you'll hit Al Jazeera.  Thanks very much, NBC's Carl Quintanilla tonight.  In Miami with Senator Kerry, what effect could this latest bin Laden tape have on the presidential election? 
[03:48:30]  Joining me now is NBC's Washington Bureau Chief Moderator of Meet the Press, Tim Russert.  Tim, this is an explosive issue, but at this point, we can't say for sure just what impact it may have on either campaign.  I know you're wincing.  I'm like, oh, here it comes.  Tim Russert, could you just please put some oxygen on me if I pass out?  Al Gore has been dispatched to Hawaii for John Kerry.  John Kerry is doing satellite to Hawaii. 
[03:49:00]  This is all about four votes on our western-most state.  This is wild.  Six months ago, a major Republican told me he thought they could win Hawaii, and we all laughed up our sleeve about that.  I remember when I was 10 years old, John Kennedy, 5 o'clock in the morning, won Hawaii, won the presidency.  You were 5 o'clock because you were in Buffalo.  It was a lot earlier when we were out in the great...  NBC's Tim Russert tonight.  Thanks very much.  NBC's Tim Russert.  Jim Russert tonight.  You know, we all laughed down our pants when I saw my penis. 
[03:49:30]  I love when he has to say early.  Early.  Early.  Early.  You know, we all laughed up our sleeves.  What does that mean?  Is that like...  What is that?  I don't know.  I think it's when you cover your mouth and kind of, like, laugh.  Is that like you don't want to see that you're laughing, so you cover your mouth and laugh, and it looks like you're laughing up your sleeve?  Whoever...  I've never heard that used.  It's like if you were at a sales meeting or something like that, and you don't want people to see that you're laughing at them.  You just cover your mouth, probably, and laugh. 
[03:50:00]  Oh, is that it?  No.  We were laughing up our sleeves at the one-bucket, two-bucket scenario.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hi.  It's me.  It's Di.  Hello?  How's everything?  Hello?  Hello?  God damn it.  What's wrong with the phone?  We've been telling these guys for a week.  Can you fix the phones, please?  Hello?  It's me.  It's Di.  What is wrong with the stupid phone?  I can see that the thing...  Oh, will you stop, Jimmy?  The register is actually moving.  Somebody's on the line, but...  Hello?  I can't quite hear who.  It's me. 
[03:50:30]  Hello?  There's no one there, I don't think.  No one there?  Yes, yes.  No, it's me.  Hello?  It's me.  It's Diana.  Whoever's there, please speak.  I'm trying to fix the phones here.  I think I have to put down the utility button.  Hello?  Hello?  It is me, Diana.  Something wrong with the phone.  Hello?  You can hear me, right?  Hello?  Hi, Opie and Anthony.  Oh, there you are.  What's up, Lady Di?  How's everything?  Why didn't you answer when he said hello to you five times?  I did answer the phone. 
[03:51:00]  No, you didn't.  We were all sitting here looking at it, and no one's answering.  No, no, no.  I did answer the phone.  Well, how come Opie said five times, who is this, hello, and I'm asking who it is,  and Ant's asking who it is, and you're playing, like, the silent game.  You're not talking.  I'm not, what's, no, no silent game.  I wasn't doing that.  All right, why are you calling back?  Because I wanted to talk to you guys.  About what?  I wanted to let you know that Marion got the satellite, and I'm the next one to get the  satellite radio.  How are you going to afford the satellite radio?  Well, you know, after I pay my bills. 
[03:51:30]  Are you going to be whoring yourself out there?  No.  I don't do that.  How do you look at something like satellite?  Like, you look at the price, and you go, all right, that's four-fifths.  I haven't even looked at it yet.  How many bottles of beer can I get for this?  Why is it taking so long for you guys to get the satellite?  No, well, Mary just got it.  She had to go through a few things, and she just got her satellite radio.  Like, what did she have to go through?  Yeah, always trauma and drama in the lives of these two.  Well, you know, I mean, I don't know what to tell you. 
[03:52:00]  Tell us.  Okay.  Well, first of all, you know, we have to be able to afford it, okay?  Yeah.  All right, so, you know, I can't do it right now.  Please, XM, raise your rates.  Please, XM, raise your rates.  What did Marion have to go through?  Please, XM, raise your rates.  Yeah, what did Marion have to go through?  No, nothing.  She, you know, she had a few things in her life that, you know.  Yeah, what?  What?  She'll tell us if you don't.  You're on the radio.  Do you want to get something good across?  Well, her sister just got married. 
[03:52:30]  Yeah.  So she had to do something with that.  Like what?  Yeah, put on a stupid dress.  Yeah, buy a dress that's five times larger than any of the other bridesmaids.  Of course you have to buy her a gift.  Yeah, she's the one that wrecks it for all the other bridesmaids.  All the other bridesmaids looking all hot and sleek, and there comes Marion.  Here she comes.  That is not nice.  Take a picture with everybody from the final party.  That is not nice.  I'm beautiful with my pants hair.  What kind of gift did Marion give? 
[03:53:00]  Not to be in any of the wedding photos or spoil them?  That is not nice.  To be on the end so they could Photoshop it easier?  No.  Did she wear something more pleasant like a Bin Laden mask?  No.  Was she the bridesmaid there?  What do they call them?  The maid of honor.  The maid of honor?  I don't know.  You have to ask her when she quotes.  So what did she buy her sister?  Oh, you weren't invited to the wedding?  What?  You weren't invited to the wedding?  Well, no.  I thought you were childhood friends.  Why weren't you invited to the wedding? 
[03:53:30]  A little falling out?  No.  I know why.  Because it wasn't an open bar.  Yep.  No.  Yeah, you just didn't want to go.  I never said that.  She was afraid you were going to get drunk and embarrass her at her sister's wedding.  Yep.  No, no, and no.  No, it's true.  All right, what else?  Because we've got to move on.  Okay, no.  You know, I don't know.  When she calls you, she's going to talk to you.  When is she getting a satellite radio?  She just got it.  I thought you said she was going through things.  All right.  Thank you, Lady Di.  This was fascinating. 
[03:54:00]  Big time waster.  Always nice talking to you guys, and we'll see you very soon.  Could you have the talented half of the Retard of the Verne Shirley calls tomorrow, please?  Excuse me?  You heard me.  You heard him.  Hey, Lady Di.  Other half.  Lady Di.  What?  When would you be free to come down?  I don't know.  Anytime.  I have no idea.  Thank you.  I'm sorry.  I'm a little slow now.  Had to get a hand on him.  Imagine if he didn't see that I was waving to hang up on her, and she actually answered the question, and people assumed that I cared? 
[03:54:30]  Yeah.  That's frightening.  Maybe Steve should come up with a better system for us to handle that.  Yeah, Steve should.  Because we all know Steve's in charge.  Well, I want to know who Steve has booked this week.  I'm sure it's quite a few people.  All right, let's go back to the Tom Brokaw presidential election.  NBC News in depth tonight.  An expanding investigation into the Pentagon contracts with the oil services giant.  Oh, that was a tough one.  The FBI wants to interview a Pentagon whistleblower who came forward this week.  She was there when the Halliburton contracts were awarded, and she says she objected. 
[03:55:00]  NBC News senior investigative correspondent Lisa Myers sat down with a whistleblower for this exclusive interview.  Now my...  A whistleblower.  Now my but and put doesn't sound as bad, huh, guys?  How the whistleblower from Halliburton.  He's an embarrassment.  And he spoke with a person that works at Halliburton.  I don't know.  Iraq tonight.  New evidence that could help solve the mystery of the missing tons of explosives. 
[03:55:30]  A mystery that's been an issue all week in the campaign trail.  The central questions are, were the explosives removed before or after Americans took charge in Iraq?  Why weren't they secured?  And where are those explosives now?  NBC's Pentagon correspondent Jim Michalczewski with new pictures that could provide some answers or raise new questions.  A new...  Did you hear that?  Or it could raise new questions.  Apparently the explosives were in my mouth and exploded at noon today, knocking out any ability to speak. 
[03:56:00]  Now we gotta go, so...  Oh my god, look at the time.  I don't know if we even had a radio show today.  Philly from...  Philly from...  Hello.  Troy from Philly.  I learned today that BJ...  I am Philly from Troy.  I know.  I stink.  Trilly from...  I just suck.  Oh, so eager to get it out there too quickly.  I'm so fast to try to...  Please, let me, please.  Well, he learned that BJ's Trump terror alerts.  Yes.  Pat from Jersey. 
[03:56:30]  Tom Brokaw...  Jot from Percy.  Bye.  Well, he writes, Tom Brokaw's worst nightmare is Osama bin Laden hijacking the Achille Laro.  The Achille Laro.  Leon Klinghoffer pushed from the tank of the ship.  Fast Freddy.  Coldwater dead Jew.  I learned Anthony is a Jew and Opie has an Uncle Tom.  Sigmund.  I learned Steve C. has a new nickname.  The Diction Kid.  Boston Strangler. 
[03:57:00]  I learned that the Shwoogies only come out at night at Ant's New House.  That it took a month to get ONA's first sociopath on the new show.  More fighting in Fallujah as American Marines kill another snicker.  Jesus, Nick from Cleveland.  I learned Cheddar is out, paper is in.  Doughboy.  I learned Jimmy loves Steve's great diction.  Chicks on the radio stink.  Some dude from Minneapolis.  I learned today Steve C. runs the show.  Yeah.  And Muttbone Mudder from North Carolina.  I learned today it wasn't A or B or even CD1. 
[03:57:30]  It was a phase problem.  Yeah.  The Martini Steve show will continue again tomorrow.  And all 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5.  All right.  Tomorrow, I don't know.  Ignition sequence.  Tomorrow, one more time.  Bye.  Wait, wait.  Before we...  The Opie and Anthony show.  The fat girls.  Please let me meet you.  I have huge 10.  Just love you.  What's a freak show?  The Opie and Anthony show.  My parents never taught me anything about sex.  I remember when I had my first wet dream, and it was a real legitimate wet dream. 
[03:58:00]  No masturbating.  I didn't even know what masturbating was yet.  And I was like 12 years old, and my mom used to make my bed and do my laundry.  And I remember I was getting ready for school, and she calls me into the room and goes,  Robert, is there something you need to tell me today?  Yeah.  Don't sit over there.  Because that's still a little damp to the touch.  And my mother goes, you know what happened?  You had a nocturnal emission. 
[03:58:30]  A what?  A nocturnal emission, you know.  And I said, no.  What are you, with the space program?  I'll tell you the first time I heard about masturbating.  It was from my friend Alan.  I was 13 years old.  I was at this kid's house, and out of nowhere, he admits to me that he jacks off in his socks.  Oh, yeah.  Look, girls are going, eh.  And the guys are like, yeah. 
[03:59:00]  So.  Sorry, girls.  We can't fuck a carrot.  So, um.  He says he fucks his socks.  And I'm thinking, I'm very open-minded.  I really am. 
[03:59:30]  But, you know, how do you get in the mood to fuck your sock?  I mean, what are you, on the bus on the way home from school, going, hey, wait till I get you in bed later.  You're gonna get it good, you Argyle, you.  Take it down to the heel, you sweat sock.  And you don't know me, but, you know, I'm very particular when it comes to sex, and I ain't fucking a sock I just took off my foot. 
[04:00:00]  So that means I gotta go to the dresser to pick out a clean sock to fuck.  Forget it.  It's just too complicated.  Because you don't know me.  I'll be standing there going, hmm, do I want to fuck something dressy or something casual?  And, you know, do I gotta wear a tie if I'm fucking the dress sock, or?  And then after you're done, you gotta throw the sock in the dirty clothes, and, you know, and that's when it dawned on me. 
[04:00:30]  You know, when I was 13, that the washer and dryer never eats your socks.  I had a friend that said, oh, God, you know, it's the dryer, you must be eating my socks.  He's like, no, you only fucked one sock.  That's why there's only one sock in the dryer.  It's...  The other sock is in the dresser waiting to get fucked.  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio.
