<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  It began with a discussion of aging rock stars, specifically The Who and Roger Daltrey (one host recounting a minor encounter), and Pearl Jam's continued touring success.  This was followed by a phone call, and later in-studio appearance, with Sandy Kane, the “Naked Cowgirl,” who discussed her legal battles with Opie and Anthony, her new CD "I Love Nick," her relationship with Pastor Joel Osteen, and humorous anecdotes about their past court appearances.  The "fucker right in the pussy" viral video phenomenon dominated significant portions of the show, with detailed discussions of specific instances and their absurdity.  The hosts also discussed their 4th of July plans, SiriusXM programming (including themed playlists and other personalities like Denny Falco, a frequent caller who discussed his upcoming wedding), and further tangents about Sandy Kane's CD cover art (featuring outdated *America's Got Talent* judges) and voyeuristic observations of nearby buildings.

The show further included a segment on a Nina Hagen music video, focusing on her physique,  followed by reminiscing about 80s DJ experiences at Houlihan's,  celebrities' birthdays, and a lengthy, graphically explicit discussion about male masturbation. The World Cup was also a topic, sparking discussion about potential song choices, a critique of a Pitbull and Jennifer Lopez song (with vulgar commentary), and perceived American team favoritism.  A caller, Mark from Austin, offered his theory on Christopher Cross's career decline, blaming his appearance.  Sandy Kane's in-studio appearance involved detailed discussions of her music, "I Love Nick," and graphically explicit recounts of her sexual experiences, including a detailed account of a sexual encounter with David Brenner.  This also included discussions of her religious experiences and her use of the "Daily Word."  Kane's song was played on air.

Another segment focused heavily on Sandy Kane, detailing a story about a gangbang in Upper Manhattan, her past drug use (angel dust and peyote) and its connection to sex, and her arrest in Times Square for taking photos (resulting in another song).  The hosts interspersed jokes and comments throughout.  A brief discussion of the World Cup, emphasizing their dislike of the sport, was also included, along with several ad reads.

A later segment featured comedian Neil Brennan as a studio guest. The discussion centered on a comedian named "Rich" who listened to right-wing talk radio to prepare for arguments, despite not using political material in his act.  This devolved into a crude and offensive quiz on Jewish knowledge,  a bizarre story about a titty-fucking injury, a video of a man masturbating on hidden camera, and a discussion on clean vs. dirty comedy.  The conversation also touched on Brennan's Taekwondo, audience reactions to comedy, comedy classes, and various comedians (Eddie Murphy, Dave Chappelle, Mitch Hedberg), concluding with a wild pig hunting story and numerous advertisements.

The final segment featured a rambling conversation with no named guests, starting with a story about the hosts' irresponsible behavior in Encino,  a Sylvester Stallone and John Travolta anecdote involving a plate of fudge, a discussion of *Staying Alive*, Frank Stallone's contributions to the soundtrack, and John Travolta's dancing (with explicit sexual references). This segued into California mountain lion overpopulation, coyotes ambushing dogs, pit bulls, and their aggressive nature, culminating in a story about a pit bull killing nine coyotes.  The segment concluded with advertisements for HGH supplements, generic Viagra, a garage organization franchise, and a mention of a video of bears making out.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  better than ever  we're back, we're back  I'd go see The Who  I don't know about that  I would definitely go see The Who  yeah  maybe Roger Daltrey could come in here and talk about The Who next time  no  that would be nice  he came in but  we were a bit starstruck  that was one of those days where I think we were all a bit starstruck  he didn't want to talk about anything but his charity that day  what was his charity, I forgot  I don't know  it was kids, I think 
[00:00:30]  something with kids  something about kids  that were kids  does he feel a little guilty about his bandmate?  so he starts a kid's charity  maybe that's it, yeah  oh the horrors he must have committed  right  like I was completely into The Who growing up  but I would not buy their new album now  so who's their audience?  but does that make you old?  well it makes me 
[00:01:00]  the demo that is a Who fan  or was  so who do they expect is going to buy this album  if not the likes of me  moi  there's certain bands that have no desire to hear their new music  but  Pearl Jam when they released new stuff  still in  yeah  who else  well you don't really like the Allman Brothers  but when they were still like  putting out new stuff  I was in  you two right?  when you make them out  yeah but you two never went away  I guess I'm talking about the bands that  kind of went on the 
[00:01:30]  Pearl Jam technically never went away  smaller venue circuit  Pearl Jam technically never went away  right Travis?  they didn't take a hiatus  since alive  no  they just never went away  their popularity dropped drastically for a while  and I remember there was an article  I think in Rolling Stone magazine or something  basically saying  you know Pearl Jam never went away  they just reinvented themselves  yeah  and now they're just huge again  yes  right  you remember the article right?  and they were talking about bootlegging and all that  and they allowed their fans to tape their stuff 
[00:02:00]  kind of using the Grateful Dead model  yeah I mean  and that helped their popularity to continue  they were one of the first people to just let you  you know record  and also to release their own  right  albums  I mean they were available  Travis put your dick away  look he's jerking off talking about it  they played Strangers Tribe for the first time last week  how great is that?  wow  amazing  absolutely amazing  are they coming around?  close?  no not this year  fuck  why did you skip New York?  why did you skip New York?

[00:32:00]  just so you can thank him  properly  yes that's fine  really?  sure I'll be delighted  to thank Denny  for the guitar picks  as well  really?  yeah  god Denny figured out  how to get back  on our radio show  guitar picks  some cool ones  yeah  nice camera  where did he  get the guitar picks from?  I don't know  oh for someone  who didn't get rid of him  that they were  James Penfield  they threw him out  in San Francisco  one of the guys  is a big Giants fan  because they're San Francisco guys  yeah they are  Denny  Denny fell a couple  Anthony's photographing him  right now  he's on 8th Avenue 
[00:32:30]  with fucking camera lens  wow  that looks old though  because the color's weird  yeah yeah  it's like a grayish  so it looks like  a really old lens  yeah it's a new one though  I don't know why  they make it that color  wow  if somebody wants to get  some discreet photos  yeah  that lens  that lens belongs  in a bush  yeah  it certainly does  I was taking pictures  from my apartment  there's a  there's a  I guess  teenage girl 
[00:33:00]  what?  no  it's a hotel  it's like a motel  it's fucking  with all their windows  facing my apartment  so I was using  this 200mm  and  we get some pretty  fucking good pictures  I didn't get any nudes  no nudes  I got some women  like walking around  in little fucking  nighties and shit  really?  on a seawater  yeah yeah  we'll take a few  is that illegal?  a few more later  I don't think it is  I think if you're just  fucking out by your window  and the window's open  that's from your window  it's none of your  fucking business 
[00:33:30]  and they don't believe  in shades  it's all expectation  of privacy  man  and how  you know  what privacy  can you expect  if you're just  fucking hanging out  E-Rock  remember the windows  at K-Rock  all year  in the office  I wish I had  this then  that was amazing  this then  I know we've said  it a million times  but  can I just say  we did afternoon  drive at N.E.W.  and remember  the girls would come home  and get ready  for happy hour  and then  there was at least  three or four showers  wait 
[00:34:00]  which one are you  talking about  K-Rock?  I was talking about  K-Rock  because we had  the big window  in the studio  and then the one  in the office  we had it at XM  at one point  until they knocked  that building down  where that old  steakhouse used to be  no but N.E.W.  had the showers  right off the side  of the studio  you missed the N.E.W.  days where  yeah it was a whole  line of showers  and it was almost  a guarantee  we would see  a woman showering  a nubile woman  almost every day  I would say  at least three  out of the five days  we were there  we would see women 
[00:34:30]  showering  getting ready  for happy hour  and then of course  yeah I forgot  about the K-Rock  window  where that  disgusting pig  would exercise  naked  on the bike  she'd be on her  exercise bike  and that should be  exciting and titillating  but she was a mess  remember  did she know  we were watching  she had to have known  it was great  she had a big bush  there was one or two  really good ones  remember her big bush  we didn't see that  oh then we saw  that other couple  yeah there was one other  good one  and then there was one  from the office  at K-Rock 
[00:35:00]  that you could see  that was facing  the other direction  what about the XM  where they had that  short building  across the street  that's the one  I'm talking about  they had a weird  little like  kind of a penthouse  like apartment  and they were  patio  you would see  some nudes in there  yeah  yeah they were  fucking in there  doing some of that  fucking  Denny  oh yeah  morning gentlemen  how are you  Denny Falco  getting ready for  the big holiday weekend  that's right  big three day weekend  holiday weekend  and you're doing  a fucking wedding  instead of Anthony's party  I got a contract 
[00:35:30]  what's wrong with you  a contract  a signed contract  put a contract out on you  oh it was January  it was signed  yeah  oh alright  yeah but you knew  he was going to have a party  why wouldn't you  January  huh  I booked this in January  January  it happens  it happens  what are people doing  on the radio  4th of July  what are some of the big  events around the dial  you mentioned the  firecracker 500  yes  counting them down  counting them down  counting them down 
[00:36:00]  the firecracker 500  of course  Beach Boys  always do a lot of  Beach Boys  Boys of Summer  ah the summer  of course  yeah the boys  a good band  favorite summer songs  things like that  where were you  in the summer of 75  when this was a hit  maybe you were  rubbing on some  suntan lotion  on the beach  stuff like that  bring people right back  I love it  bring people right back  remember radio stations  used to do  this weekend  it's the class of 80  yeah I love  class reunion weekend  class reunion weekend  that's what it is  oh god  class reunion 
[00:36:30]  summertime 1969  on the road to Woodstock  let's crank this one up  by CSNY  you know  you know  I love it  bring people back  anybody can play the music  but it's  things you see  between the records  right the DJ's  gotta spark that  that memory  sure  and you guys  were talking about  the groups that play  new music at shows  it's a shame  because people  Mike Love does that  all the time  hey we got a brand new  song  who cares about  a new Mike Love song  it's a shame  it really is  I'd rather just hear  some Beach Boys 
[00:37:00]  Beach Boy fanatics  do like the new stuff  like that  but you know what  small percentage  of the people  though I think  I see it as time  that could be spent  playing another one  of the hits  right  and they just ran  out of things  to sing about  yeah come on  they're now singing  about the sand  between their toes  or something  and you know  they're 70 years old  singing about  surfing  on the beach  did you see  the Mick Jagger video  that he poked fun  at Monty Python  it's a good video  it's funny  that's making the rounds  today 
[00:37:30]  we like funny  he's sitting down  on the couch  with Charlie Watts  really  let's see funny  what did you see  the new Beach Boys  song is not good  no  because now  we're surfing  surfing on the web  you don't like that Sam  no  oh is that awful  surfing  alright here it is  Denny brought some  funny to our show  thank you Denny  was this for the  Monty Python live show  yeah  ok 
[00:38:00]  let's see what  it's all about  oh no  oh it was amazing  hey Mick  you wanted to  look at the  set list for  tomorrow night  yeah  there's all this  stuff in the paper  about the review  that the lighting  is too dark  and everything  where's Patrick  he's not here  he's in London  Patrick  what's he doing  in London  the Monty Python  the show's at the O2  oh yeah  Monty Python  they're still going 
[00:38:30]  yeah they're doing  ten shows  do you want to go  ten shows  that's  wow that's pretty  amazing  I've been corny  I mean I bet  it's expensive  but I mean  who wants to  who wants to see  that again  really  I mean it was  really funny  in the 60s  well the first  show sold out  in 40 seconds  wow that's pretty  amazing  I mean  still a bunch  of wrinkly old  men trying to  relive their youth  and make a load  of money  I mean the best  one died years  ago  maybe back in the 70s 
[00:39:00]  it was fantastic  I mean it was  the funniest thing  I mean  I mean you've seen it  all before  I mean  I mean they put it  all up on YouTube  well  anyway  what did you want  to do tomorrow night  well  start with something  everyone knows  like let's spend  the night together  and then we can  move on to  get off my cloud  and then  then should hit  satisfaction  I think  dead parrot sketch  dead parrot sketch 
[00:39:30]  that's pretty good  alright  it's funny  self deprecating  Charlie Watts was good  yeah  Jesus  he probably tried to say  one thing and Mick's like  I got it  yeah  don't worry about it  do you like Charlie Watts'  jazz stuff  he does a whole big band thing  oh does he  is it good  yeah it's good  I had no idea  it even existed  there's real  real big band music  I cannot stand that  you know  I can tell when  big band is bad  yeah  big band stuff 
[00:40:00]  or jazz stuff  or it's jazz big band  jazz odyssey  you're not a big jazz fan  I hate the jazz  I hate it  not only just don't like it  I hate it  little cool jazz  relaxing by the pool  listen to this shit 
[00:40:30]  the drumming's good  what the fuck  you don't like this  listen to it  what  welcome to the  Hotel Excelsior  this is so  fucking  just self-absorbed  crap  on the part of the musician  but as a musician  I mean  they're really playing  no  this is garbage  listen to it  the trumpet player 
[00:41:00]  is playing one thing  the drummer  what the fuck  is he doing right now  the drummer's good though  yeah that's  that's  that's pretty good  who is this  Miles Davis  oh  Miles Davis  godspeed Miles  you don't like  a little smooth jazz  a little samba music 
[00:41:30]  when you're sitting  by the pool  samba music  Stan Getz  Mamba  what's he get  the Mamba Carlos  girl from Ipanema  no  Desafonado  Stan Getz  wait watch this  what's he get  classic  classic chip joke  right there  well you enjoy  that beach boy music  I want you to  put any songs on it  what else are they doing  on the radio  I will actually  what else are we doing  I know on the 70s  we're doing a salute  to muscle cars  muscle cars 
[00:42:00]  this is a joke right  this is your bit  this has to be a bit  no seriously  if you go on the  SiriusXM website  for 70s on 7  they're going to do  a salute to muscle cars  how do you do that  how do you do that  very good question  I asked the program  director that  and he goes  oh don't worry  it's going to be great  so I believed him  so are they songs  is there any promos  we can hear  I don't think we made  any promos  I kind of like  the 70s on 7  I do like that  oh I'll listen to that  but I'm not going to  get into a muscle car  discussion  what is it  did you play songs 
[00:42:30]  that revolve around  cars of the day  I guess so  I was still kind of  in the dark on this  yeah  I'll be brought up  to speed  like wrapped up  like a douche  oh there you go  something like that  it's douche  it's douche  alright whatever  blinded by the light  meant for me  the earth band  right  so what are you guys  doing for the big weekend  none of your fucking business  how about that  Barracuda  this fits  there you go  why  because it's a  Barracuda  the car  the Barracuda  I swear to god  all these years 
[00:43:00]  I thought it was about  the fish  well I don't know  what it's about  I think it's about  the fish  but even if  it is about the fish  it's the name of the car  so it would fit  the general  but is it about the fish  or the car  on the great ladies  of rock and roll weekend  the great ladies  of rock and roll weekend  salute ladies  who's doing that  and the Nancy Wilson  well you can  you usually do that  on Mother's Day  salute the great ladies  of rock and roll  there's like five of them  everybody from  Sheryl Crow  to you know 
[00:43:30]  the Ronettes  everybody in between  how many muscle car songs  could you possibly have  I can't even think of one  it's a song about a Chevelle  yeah give us some muscle car songs  GTO  I was kind of stumped  when they told us about this  maybe you could play some BTO  in place of a GTO  rocking down the highway  oh there you go  oh so you could do  the highway songs  could do that  that's cheating  nobody gonna take my car  I think that's cheating  drive it to the sky  a little deep purple  taking it to the streets  taking it to the streets  doobies  that's cheating  how about the cars  on the muscle car weekend 
[00:44:00]  you gotta have songs  about cars  not the highways  play some golden earring  there you go  radar love  radar love  see what we're doing  now is we're brainstorming  this is what happens  when you have meetings  oh god  thank god  someone tells me  this is just storming  that just reminded us  why we don't have meetings  this is nonsense  no it's good to kick around  the ideas  highway star  that's a good one  but they're not  muscle cars  no  this could just be  driving 
[00:44:30]  well it's good driving songs  about Tom  uh  uh  uh  uh  what uh  uh  life is a highway  laugh is a highway  well that wouldn't be  on the 70s  who would say that again  uh  Tom Cochran  Tom Cochran  right  I don't get it  it's just  there's not enough  how do they explain  the muscle car weekend  on the website  yeah yeah  tell us  they don't  there's no mention of it  well I'm gonna have to  go after the program director  human newman  and talk to him  this is a good one 
[00:45:00]  human newman  yeah  who's that  he's the program director  of 70s on 70s  how do I know that name  crank it up  too bad his last name  is in Haggit  all right  that's good  thanks  you hear it right  every time  I hear it loud  I hear it in my own head  when the music isn't even playing  yeah  to every song  Florentine kind of dispelled  that rumor  though didn't he  I guess 
[00:45:30]  but  who's he  what does he know  about me  he's a metal magician  I mean he's  why was I  you know  what  it's not that at all  he wouldn't say  something like that  right  why hide it  stupid  I don't get it  why would he do it  doesn't make sense  they don't like being cute  I love Florentine's take  on things like  fantasy movies  and video games  it's just not real  it's stupid 
[00:46:00]  to even want to do that  I'm not a child  yeah I'm not a child  I'm gonna watch  the Habit movie  no we asked him  about ketchup  because I'm not  nine years old  who says that  he's hilarious  my son likes ketchup  he's three  he's three  but I'm not nine  he doesn't like ketchup  on hamburgers  he's so fucking funny  to listen to  when he's going off  on those  no  no  my son likes ketchup  he's three  it's the abruptness 
[00:46:30]  it's the irrational  finality  I love it  of his statements  it's very funny  and he hits you  with a why  why  you like chocolate  no  why  I liked it  when I was six  right  Star Wars  never saw one of them  don't care  it's not real  it's fake  muscle car weekend  what else is going on  around the  the old  satellite radio  oh yeah  company guys  there's a lot of stuff  out there  all you have to do  is check out  SiriusXM.com  no one's checking that 
[00:47:00]  you have to  it's easier to send people  right to the website  we'd rather just hear  what are some of the themes  these channels are doing  for the big 4th of July weekend  what's the 80's channel doing  maybe  probably countdowns  a lot of great summer countdowns  great summer countdowns  as long as you play the music  from the summer time  people relive the great summers  of their lives  oh is that what it is  depressing  you know  I get depressed  when I think it's stuff like that  like all that time  that's gone by  really  living  great summers  of our lives  remembering when you were 
[00:47:30]  putting lotion on the beach  in 75  the guy's got wriggled skin now  and he's fucking  looking at his wife  and trying to push it  on the steps for 13 years  on life insurance  let's think of that  summertime 1964  you had so much happening  you know  the British Invasion  the Beach Boys  the Motown sound  so if you  if you went to high school  or you graduated college then  those were your songs  oh really  yeah it's 50 years ago too  wow  yeah  and it's always great  to have stagers too  huh  1964  oh what the 
[00:48:00]  it's called a stager  stager  what is that  where they have  little news clips  and stuff  yeah then you drop  the old  TV dial  and then you hear  some like  all in the family  clip or something  this is one  small step  for man  boy  the way  Glenn Miller  oh god  yeah  like a good stager  Ronan Martin's laughing  what's wrong with the good stager  Jenny was all excited  he wanted me to continue  yeah  I mean  you know  you listen to the 90's channel  they'll put a little  Seinfeld clip on there 
[00:48:30]  but that's not a stager  but you try to relate  you see what he did again  the Seinfeld thing  he's very needy  he just wants to  I know he likes  he wants to relate  to everybody  I've mentioned it a few times  hey a good plug for you  yesterday  I was driving  driving home from Jersey  on Friday  in the afternoon  and I had the radio on  and you know  when you have that reverb  like it's playing somewhere else  I pull up to a guy next to me  and he's listening to Sam's show  wow  was he wrapped around  a telephone pole hopefully 
[00:49:00]  and they were playing  an Opie and Anthony cut  wow  and I turned to the guy  we were this close  and traffic was at a crawl  and it was Sam  oh and hey  oh and hey  so the guy goes yeah  so he goes  what about Sam  I go yeah  not so much  oh shit  I said good show  just wanted to give Sam a plug  wow  did you let the guy know  that you could blow yourself  no  that didn't come up  in the discussion  you could have told him  you were Denny Falcone  no  why wouldn't you tell him  you were Denny Falcone  that's ridiculous  the Denny Falcone  that's stupid  but I just wanted to 
[00:49:30]  and I told Sam yesterday  I said I was very proud  to  what do you think  about Hunter  the VJ  yeah  does a nice job  on the radio  what does he do  that makes it a nice job  he was a good VJ  you know  he was kind of  relaxing  they were all  just our friends  back then  weren't they  I like Mark  I always see Mark  in the halls  oh sure  he's pressing that button  turning on the radio  so everybody could hear it  he's stealing  he's stealing  content  yeah we always plug that  can you do that

I just wanted to say this, man  I hope you don't take it personally, Anthony  Right, we'll try not to  But, you know, as much as I love both of you guys, right?  I have a hard-on for both of you for years  Sure, sure  So, in fact, my song for you guys used to be  Can't Get Enough of Your Love Baby  Right  Is it on the new CD?  No, that's a thing  Fuck  You know, my CD is my own songs  I didn't write that one 
[01:22:30]  Sure  But anyway, I did this show the last time and I had a sex dream  About Anthony  Oh, right  Wow  What did you do in the dream?  Was it a good one?  Well, you were like laying over here and  Yeah  Okay  How had I died?  No, it was just  It was like more like a  Blow me type of dream  Like you were laying back and blow me  You were eating your pussy, Ed  Oh  Nice  And it was a big bulge in your pants  You're a lucky man  Wow, big bulge in my pants 
[01:23:00]  Oh, yeah, okay  Yeah  So, and then we were in my kitchen  Wait, was he eating your pussy?  Uh-huh  No, he wanted me to blow him  Of course  Of course  No, it was almost like  I'm not crazy  It was almost like a David Brenner  Blow me, but I'm not going to blow you  Uh-huh  Yeah  Wait, David Brenner you blew?  Yeah, I blew David Brenner  Oh  How was it?  He had the smallest dick I ever saw in my life  Really?  Poor guy's dead  He can't even defend himself  Yeah, I know  Hey, but, you know  He did  So, um 
[01:23:30]  Tall men usually have smaller dicks  Oh, yeah?  You didn't know that?  Is it perspective, though?  Huh?  Is it perspective because they're tall?  So it looks like it's smaller  Or is it actually a small dick?  I think that it's really  The smallest dick I ever blew  Was a Jewish guy  And he was about 6'2  And he had like a baby cock  A baby  And I felt sorry for him  Yeah  But, um  What can I do?  There's nothing  You know, some guys have small cocks  But it doesn't really matter  To a woman like people think  I don't think  If you love someone 
[01:24:00]  If you love someone  You know, I mean  As long as they have a long tongue  Okay  All right  Because, you know  Women like oral sex  What about the sex dream with Anthony?  Did he, uh  Oh, thanks  No, it was like  Thanks for bringing that back around  Yeah, yeah, right  It was a big bulge  Did he eat your pussy?  It was a big bulge in his pants  And he like was  Leading back  And it was like  Blow me  Yeah  I'm very demanding like that  Yeah, well  Say that  Blow me  Did you blow him?  Did you?  Huh?

[01:24:30]  I'm being honest  I could say it, guys  I could make something wrong  Yeah, we don't want you  I sniffed his cock  And I sniffed his asshole too  Right  But, you know  He would be the type  That you'd probably want you to  Blow me in and sniff my ass  Bye  That's what David Brenner  I was spitting  True story  I was spitting David Brenner's  Come out in the sink  And I heard the door slam  What a great way to start a story  He didn't even say goodbye  Wait, you were still spitting 
[01:25:00]  Come out in the door slam?  He was spitting his kind  Didn't Jewish girls don't swallow  As much as I love them  That's hilarious  And then I heard the door slam  You did  He didn't even say goodbye  Wow  That's the greatest quote ever  Where did this go down?

Yeah  Yeah  It's going to be legal everywhere  Within the next few years  You know, I've got to be honest  For three weeks  I have  It's funny you ask me that  But I  I see it in your eyes  It almost looks like you might have  No  Nothing today  For three weeks  Why?  Oh, you're on medication  Because  You know 
[01:26:30]  The reason  I think that my eyes might be glassy  Because a lot of  You know, I wear eyeliner a lot  Because I wanted to be  With better people  So  Yeah, I don't want to be with pushers  And dealers  And so I feel  The reason I'm here  Is because three weeks ago  I stopped smoking pot  Oh  So you were smoking a lot?  Um, not that much  But enough  You know  But I think you always overdo it  It's like if you have cookies in the house 
[01:27:00]  You're going to eat them  Right  If you have cocaine in the house  You're going to snort it  Right  If David Brenner's in your house  You're going to  You're going to suck his dick  And take his comb  Suck his dick  But not eat it  He was a great, great man  I've got to say  He was a great  I loved him very much  He was  He helped me  But as I was spitting  David Brenner's  Come out in the sink  In the sink  I heard the door slam  That's my favorite sentence  Oh, it's great  No, but it was a true story  Not the opening line  Of Tale of Two Cities  Yeah  Tale of Two Titties  He didn't 
[01:27:30]  You know  He didn't even  He didn't even  Undress me  I mean  He didn't even care  I just wanted to get a blowjob  Like you were in a dream  Yeah  He just pulled his dick out  And you sucked at it  Yeah, yeah  And well  We kept smoking cigarettes  He used to smoke Newport  So he kept smoking  He said  Then he says  Well  Oh, he folded his arms  And said  Well, what are we going to  Like, let's get rolling here  I'm not here for  For entertainment  Yeah, yeah  Hello  I'm out of cigarettes  Yeah  Blow me  But it ain't who you know

[01:28:30]  So when it became the song  I went to Nashville  And it's called The Bible Belt  And it really is  So I was trying to sell a song  And this woman said  You don't know Jesus, Sandy?  You don't know  You never met Jesus?  Uh-oh  So I said, um  I blew him once  Yeah  Yeah  Did you have a big dick?  Yeah  As Judas was spitting my cum out  In the sick  Did you have a big cock?  Did you ever do that?  Do you ever, like, look at Jesus  And say, how big is his dick?  Who was under the table 
[01:29:00]  At the last supper?  Yeah  Jesus was humble  He probably gave himself six  Yeah  He didn't get out  His own cock  Oh, come on  But, uh  But anyway  You were Orthodox Jewish?  Hardcore?  Well, hardcore  Like, everyone was  I have a song on my  My cassette  It was  Everyone was Jewish in Newark  The butcher, the baker  Even the shoemaker  So I didn't meet a Jew  Until I left home  I thought Gentile  Was a floor covering  But  Oh, look out  No, but 
[01:29:30]  No, so I went to Nashville  When I was, like, about 30  And there I saw  Um  I met this woman  She said  You don't know Jesus  She closed  This is how religious  She closed her office  And went and bought me a Bible  Really?  I never bought the song, no  So it's like  I met Jesus for the first time  Oh  But she never bought the song  Did you read the Bible?  No, I didn't  There you go  I don't understand the Bible  Do you?  I don't either  This one begat  That one  That one begat  That one begat  Begat  Begat 
[01:30:00]  It starts off a little slow  Yeah  I don't understand the Bible  But I read the Daily Word  Every  What's the Daily Word?  You never heard of the Daily Word?  What is it?  Enlighten us  It's like  Every day there's a message  Mine is  From God  I use it every day  Whether I need to or not  You never heard of the Daily Word?  Only when they caught me off in traffic  I found my first Daily Word  Walking in my neighborhood  At St. Patrick's Cathedral  It's a great little Bible  And it really, you know, like says  But what is it? 
[01:30:30]  It's an easier Bible to read?  Yes  Okay  It's a pop-up  Every day has a different message  Crucifixion is a depressing pop-up  I love a good pop-up book  Me too  Pop-up Bible to crucifixion  Yeah, he's on his cross  He's just lugging it  You know, it's a very good book, man  And it really is very positive  Sometimes you can be depressed  Do you ever get depressed, you guys?

[03:06:00]  It's like sitting like  It doesn't feel good  You gotta pull it up  You pull it up  And then you buck your hips forward  And then you let your dick drop  Yeah  But you don't want to do a split on your dick  That's really bad for your dick  It's a lot of pressure  Your dick's not  Especially if it's like a hardwood floor  Think about that  You're squashing your dick on a hardwood floor  You can fucking hurt your balls that way as well  Um  Yeah  My dog almost hurts my balls a lot  Your dog  Yeah  You know my three year old jumps on my balls  Yeah my dog jumps on my balls all the time  I let her jump on top  She like uh 
[03:06:30]  If I'm lying on the bed  She'll come up and grab my hands  And just jump up and stomp on my abs  And I'm like  It's a good ab workout  Just get a little kid to go fucking crazy  But occasionally she'll miss the abs  And hit the cock-a-roon  I'd like to open with a good ball story  A buddy of mine  Won't say who it was  Uh  Having sex with a girl  Uh  Titty fucking her  Which  This is my buddy who just likes to titty fuck  I don't know  Hey who does that  Who am I to judge  I have zero interest in titty fucking  That's fifth place to me  I think you're just playing coy  I know what you're doing 
[03:07:00]  You're just setting up a nice titty fucking  Scenario later  So I will never  I will  Under no circumstances  Will I titty fuck any woman  Who comes to the valley  There's gonna be a girl  After your show  Holding delicious tits  Like absolutely perfect ones  And I will not  And I challenge  I challenge her  And say  What'd you say about titty fucking  And they're gonna be big and real  A buddy of mine  Titty fucking  Okay  Uh  He's about to finish  He says to the girl  Squeeze them together  Okay  She grabs his nuts 
[03:07:30]  And squeezes them  As hard as she can  And he comes like a bobcat  And he came  He came  He came  Come  And blood  Oh  Oh my god  Yeah  She broke him  Yeah  What a crazy bitch  Yeah  I mean that's a good old fashioned miscommunication  That's a three's company miscommunication  She's mad that he's titty fucking her  She's like what about me  No I think she  I  I don't  You can't like rape titty fuck somebody  Yes you can  Yes you can 
[03:08:00]  If you have a strong mount  They let you titty fuck them  Just so that you'll get off them  What would that be  There's a lot of people that would do that  What would that be  That would be bloody though  She broke his dick  She squeezed the wrong  Something happened  It's all wrong  She's  She's  She was supposed to push her tits together  That's a terrible miscommunication  That's a three's company style miscommunication  Come and knock on the door  That is a squeeze together  I thought you meant something else  Yeah  Although he then went to the nurse  Or he went to the doctor the next day  And she rubbed  Like MRI jelly 
[03:08:30]  Or whatever  The cat scan jelly  On his dick  And he said that's one of the best sexual experiences  He's ever had in his life  Well it's always cold  I would imagine that would feel really good on your dick  Yeah  Wow  And what happened when the cat scanned his dick  I think he  I think he just had to not use it for a bit  Imagine if the girl was cat scanning his dick  And while she's doing it  She's going  God damn  God damn  God damn  How many times has anybody ever gone to the doctor  And started getting their dick cat scanned  And then just started fucking the doctor 
[03:09:00]  You know that's happened  I know a guy  For sure  Who  Who uh  Was staying at the Four Seasons  And  Fucked a maid  Mike Faberman fucked a maid  I mean he told us that story  Yeah  Faberman fucked a maid  And he said she wasn't even attracted  But she walked in  On him jerking off  And she was like  Oh sorry  He's like  Shut the door  Come on in  Shut the door  Come on in  And he said they didn't even talk  They just started banging  You know  You know that famous video  Of the guy that sets up his laptop  And then uh  Records maids coming in 
[03:09:30]  While he's jacking off  So like  Just  What  Really  Explain this  You say that like we know  Oh I thought  Oh you know that thing  That you watch every day  Before you do anything  There's this hilarious guy  And you can find it  Uh  E-fuck dot com  Is one of the websites that has it  And it's just this guy  That puts his laptop here  And he puts headphones on  And he just waits for the maid  And then when she comes in  He records  Like him jerking off  And he has  Is he looking at her  Or is he looking at his screen  Uh  No he's just like  You can't see his face  You just see  It's from his dick  Uh huh  To the front door 
[03:10:00]  So you just  So like the maids come in  One after another  One after another  And they're like  They all do different things  Most of them are like  Oh my god  I'm so sorry  So I'm just sit there  And just slowly turn around  But his mission was  To actually have somebody  Like fuck him  Or give him a blowjob  He just released a second one  Where finally at the end  And I almost don't want to give it away  A maid does come up  And just starts staring at it  And then slowly walks up  And he goes  Oh do you want this  And he goes  Yes I do  And the guy starts sucking him off  On the video 
[03:10:30]  No way  It's a male maid  I promise you  I promise you  That's the twist  Is that there's a male maid  I don't  You know  Listen  I don't know if you know this  But I used to be on Fear Factor  Right  I know about reality TV  And I don't buy that  I gotta say  I don't buy it  So I don't see none of them  Nonsense  Please watch the video  Act  I'm not gonna watch a guy suck a guy's dick  I know what you're doing  What you're doing  Is trying to trick me  To watch some good shit  You're trying to convert us bro  You know  You don't know me as well  As you think you know me  I'm not that dumb  Okay  How dare you  Trying to trick me  To watch the guy  Well if he didn't have  Like 500 other videos 
[03:11:00]  Of women  Turning him down  Over and over and over again  And he  I would not  I would be on your boat  To thinking it was fake  But he's been doing this  I've known about this  That doesn't mean it's not fake  The first one came out  Brian is one of the worst detectives  In the history of Scotland Yard  Well  He's following bad leads  Constantly  He said  Yeah  Inspector Clouseau  His first video came out  Like three to five years ago  Well then it's gotta be true  Well then  Yeah  That's all you can know  Your honor  Yeah  There's no need to further investigate  We've got this one locked up 
[03:11:30]  Don't pull it up  Don't pull it up  Nobody wants to  I don't wanna watch a guy  Blow a guy  Ever  I'm proud to say  I was on one of these sites  The other day  And I don't know  If anybody else does  This is where you'll  Periodically check in  To make sure you're not gay  You just watch 15 seconds of male porn  And just go like  Nope  Still not gay  As of last week  I'm still not gay  I think I'm out of the woods  You don't need to do that  I think I'm officially out of the woods  You remember the old  Kinison bit about that  It was like  They say every band's got a homosexual fantasy  So I'm sitting around my house the other day 
[03:12:00]  Going over my fantasies  Cause if there's one in there  I wanna know  I wanna fucking know  Yeah  I didn't like  The idea of a guy  There was  I think a guy was blowing another guy  Stubble  That's what bothers  It's just like stubble  There's a lot that should bother you  I don't want stubble  Anywhere near  My precious  Well men are crazy  And they're violent  And uh  They're also that way  If they're gay  Straight men are crazy and violent  And straight  Straight men and gay men 
[03:12:30]  The only difference is  One of them likes boys  Okay  So  The idea of that being  Hot and sexy  It's like getting blown by a crazy chimp  You know  I don't trust dudes  Some studly  Muscular dude  Who's sucking my dick  That guy can just rip it off  And throw it away  And go  Ha ha  Ha ha  I like how you went  A little free on the ha ha  Yeah  A big muscular guy  Going  Ha ha  Ha ha  Fucking hairy  Perfectly hairy chest  Perfectly hairy  Not too much  Just trims it  Let's it grow out a little  But doesn't get  Doesn't get unkempt 
[03:13:00]  Yeah  They're having a good time over there  I gotta say  The gays  Yeah the gays have a weird life  Because if it wasn't for the persecution  It's pretty god damn sweet  If you think about it  Like if we all  Men and women  Okay  And this is coming from a guy who has kids  And loves having kids  However  There's a weirdness to having sex  With men and women  Because it could possibly result in a child  Yeah  That weirdness is eliminated with gay people  It's just fucking  Yeah  And  There's no yang  It's all yin  You know  Or yang 
[03:13:30]  No yin  One of those  Whichever is a hard one  There's that  Well there is a bit of a yin yang  In them  There's a little bit of that  There's a bottom top issue  Yeah but there's  What the issue isn't  What a man wants  Versus what a woman wants  They're both men  So the weirdness  Like  Trying to figure out women  Especially like when you're young  One of the weirdest things  Is just the idea  Of trying to think  The way a woman thinks  Yeah  You think the way a guy thinks  You think everything's gonna be fine  And like  I remember when I was young  And I just started dating  When I was like a teenager 
[03:14:00]  I would talk to girls  The way I would talk to my friends  And they would get upset  And they would think  You're crazy  Can't do it  You can't do it  You gotta change your language  Completely  Change your language  Change your approach  Change the way  You know  Guys can fuck around  With each other  And we assume  That we're gonna like laugh  And fuck around  With each other back  And that's what we do  We insult each other  Half ass all day  Constantly  Do you know  There's a generation though  Of girls now  That are like  Ball busty  And  But it's the worst  Cause A  They're not good at it  B  They're actually ball busting 
[03:14:30]  And C  You can't hit them back  So you just have to go like  Yeah  It's crazy  That was stupid  My shirt was stupid  And you can't go like  Hey by the way  I could eviscerate you  At any point  I could have you crying  In five seconds  But if they're good at it  See  If they're good at it  Then it doesn't matter  If they're a man or a woman  It becomes irrelevant  Like  Okay  Who's really good at it  Christina Pazitsky  Is a great ball buster  She's awesome  I believe that  She's hilarious  But she's good at it  You know what I mean  And she's also  She doesn't do it  When it's not necessary  Right  You know 
[03:15:00]  She'll jump in  When she thinks  Something's funny  Is going on  Just like a comic  Yes  She's just a person  That happens to be funny  And that's when  You should be able to ball bust  When you're a person  That's actually funny  The worst is when  You're getting ball busted  By someone who's not funny  Yes  Then it's not ball busting  It's just you insulting me  And pretending it's a joke  Exactly  And it's not  It's not that funny  But I'm pretending it's funny  Cause I would like to  Have sex with you  In the next couple hours  Well I'm pretty good  At going over  All the things  That are ridiculous  About me  So if you say  Something ridiculous 
[03:15:30]  About me  Or stupid that I've done  I will fucking laugh  With you  Oh they're the best  Because I think  It's important to do  And it's fun  You know  Believe  That's one of my favorite  Parts of being friends  With comedians  It's like  You're  I'm getting made fun of  On the highest fucking level  Yeah  And it's a real pleasure  It's fun  Yeah  It's fun  Like what are you  Perfect  Come on  You're an idiot  I'm an idiot  We're all idiots  We're all skating through  This fucking weirdo life  Don't get so uptight about it  But there's a big difference  Between that 
[03:16:00]  When someone's just being funny  And someone's like  Just insulting you  You know  They just think it's funny  To make fun of you  In some way  That's not even humor  And you're like  This is weird  You know  What's going on here  It's like  I'm talking about girls  That took a class  At UCB or something  Or took like an improv class  I'm going to tell you  Something about classes  Go ahead  They don't work  I know that they have worked  For stand-up  A couple people  You know who's worked?  The stand-ups  That were in that class  They figured out  How to do comedy  Right  They figured out  How to do comedy 
[03:16:30]  But you're not going to  Figure it out from a class  What the class does do  Is it gives you an opportunity  To focus on it  And go on stage  Yes  And do your material  And fuck around  But that guy can't teach you  How to do comedy  Oh no  But he can force your hand  He can get you to do it  Yeah  He can put you in front of people  But when they start judging you  Take it all with a grain of salt  Take it all with a grain of salt  Because you might just figure out  How to do it that way  If people had caught  Like say Joey Diaz  Perfect example  Back when Joey Diaz  Was floundering  Like in the late 90s  He wasn't doing that well on stage 
[03:17:00]  Like if people have seen Joey now  He's a destroyer  He's a monster  But back then he wasn't  He just hadn't figured it out yet  What was he doing back then  He was concerned about  Other people's opinions  He was nervous  He didn't feel like  He belonged there  He didn't feel like  And he gave up one day  He's a fuck this  He just somehow or another  Figured out how to just  Be himself on stage  So he's  You know  You met him  Brian  When you met him  He was already funny  Yeah  Right  You met him  He was already Joey Diaz  Right  But before that  Like in the late 90s  He was much thinner too 
[03:17:30]  Was it a drug thing?  Was it what he was using  And not using?  Could be  Could be  He just stopped giving a fuck  You know  There was a lot going on  You know  He was also  He was much more troubled  Back then  He just  You know  He had to come into his own  You know  As a man  As a comedian  All the above  But if you gave him advice back then  That's my point  When he was bombing  Right  You would  You know  You wouldn't get it  You would be wrong  You know  If you told him  You're being too offensive  You're too rude  What you're saying is not funny  It makes people uncomfortable  Wrong  He just needed to figure out 
[03:18:00]  How to do it right  So if you watch him now  He talks about the exact same shit  I mean  Joey Diaz essentially  Talks about the exact same shit  He's always talked about  Girls assholes  This guy's a pussy  Shut your mouth  Suck my dick  You know  I mean  It's just  Him talking  Mad shit  In the most hilarious way possible  And he always did that  He just  Hadn't figured it out yet  Has anyone ever given you  Good stand up advice  Comics have  Yeah  Yeah  Comics have given me  Very good advice  Can you think of the best 
[03:18:30]  Best advice I ever got  Is don't say fuck too much  That you say fuck too much  You  You over fuck  You use out  The word  Where it doesn't mean anything  And it also makes you  Look like you're a dummy  And what  What it is  Is  A lot of times  It's a substitution  For the word  Uh  For an  Um  Uh  Uh  Instead of saying that  I say  It's fucking guy  With his fucking hair  Flowing like fucking Fabio  You know  It's  What you're doing  Is just doing  Sloppy words  It's also impossible  To know if the joke works 
[03:19:00]  If you say fucking in it  Me  The first time  If you're trying to joke out  And then you're like  I'd rather not say fuck  And then you get on stage  And you're about to do the punchline  And you're like  You know what  Let me throw in a fuck here  Just to be safe  You should never do that  But  Fucks when they're  When they belong  Are crucial  Because if you don't say fuck there  And I know you say fuck sometimes  I'm  I'm missing something  You can either  Use fuck  Or never use fuck  You can either  Jim Gaffigan  And Brian Regan it  Where there's no fucks  No fucks used  Or you can 
[03:19:30]  Joey Diaz  Rock has an interesting theory  Yeah  Everyone's funny or clean  That's  Theory sucks  Oh  Okay  The theory's absolutely ridiculous  Here's his  Here  He says  Okay  Obviously Bill Cosby  But  He says  He's the only guy  Who's actually funny or dirty  What  Again  His theory  It's ridiculous  What's  Eddie's most memorable bit  Eddie who  Murphy  Ice cream  Well it depends  Ice cream  I mean  It's probably ice cream 
[03:20:00]  Mr. T  Fucking you in the ass  I don't know about that  Yeah  I think it's ice cream  I think if you literally  Just looked for  To hit downloads on YouTube  I think ice cream  Would be higher  I think the barbecue  Would be higher  Honeymooners  Honeymooners  Getting fucked in the ass  Norton  I've been looking at you  And I know  That you know  That I want to fuck you  In the ass  That's a horrible bit  That was a horrible  It was a cartoonishly bad bit  That's a bit that I bet  He would disavow today  Yeah  But no  Because he was really good  At impressions 
[03:20:30]  That's why it was good  He's incredible  But it's a shitty  Like what if they  Fucked each other in the ass  It's like  It's shitty  Wow how do you think of that  But in the context  Of the series of bits  That he was doing  About gay people  He did it early in his act  He did it like  In the first 15 minutes  Of that special  It's kind of like  You're doing a  I'm going to fuck you  In the ass  Well I'll tell you man  When I watched that special  I was in high school  I was in Newton  And it was me  And my buddy  Jimmy Lawless  And John Bataraco  And John's sister  Was the only girl there  It was a real fucking  Buzz kill 
[03:21:00]  Because we felt bad  About laughing  At some of the stuff  But we were crying laughing  Crying laughing  It was the first time  I'd ever seen  Eddie Murphy Raw  I was like  God damn  That was funny  Or not Raw  Delirious  Raw wasn't quite as good  I don't feel  I feel like  Delirious was the best  Raw wasn't quite as good  But they both  I think Delirious  Has the barbecue  Which is an amazing bit  Oh yeah  And someone pointed out  To me  When he's finished  Someone in the audience  Yells  Do it again  Which is a pretty good sign 
[03:21:30]  For a bit  That's hilarious  Do it again  Ice cream  And the barbecue  Are both  So I would  So that's Rock's theory  That everyone  And he would say  Chappelle's best bit  Is like  Baby on the corner  Chappelle's best bit  Is about the creation  Of AIDS  I totally  I always say  To Chappelle  I always say  To Chappelle  He's the only person  On earth  Who would side  With the monkey  Well it's also  It's a really funny bit  Because like  You ever try to  Fuck a monkey 
[03:22:00]  You know how hard  It would be  To try to  Fuck a monkey  Yeah  No exactly  You either fuck  Monkeys or people  You don't fuck  Monkeys  You don't go like  I'm gonna stay home  Tonight and stick  Me and Bubbles  Fixing to give me  A foot job  Or whatever  I wonder if anybody  Has ever really  Fucked a live monkey  I mean you'd have to  Kill it to get  To fuck it  I think you  Well you'd maybe  Just give it some wine  Or something  You gotta club it  Over the head  There's no other way  A monkey's gonna  Let you fuck it  They're gonna rip  You don't think so  I don't think so  Like a  Just like a  Fucking little  Shoulder monkey 
[03:22:30]  If you have a  Little shoulder monkey  Imagine how big  Your dick looks  To that monkey  Even if you have  Just a mediocre dick  Right  Okay  Your dick is  Bigger than  Its fucking legs  I mean  That's a tiny  Little animal  You're not gonna  Stick your dick  In its butt  That's ridiculous  What if you're  Like an Asian guy  Honestly  Hey how dare you  I don't know  If that's true  Or not true  Because I don't  Go around  Looking at dicks  Plus I'm not  A big believer  In stereotypes  There's a thing  Where they have  Average penis size  By country  Yeah  I think  They didn't  Check me  They didn't  Check you  How do we know  If they're getting  Accurate readings 
[03:23:00]  They did a sample size  I do not believe  Any fucking statistics  I don't believe them  I gave up  I believe in the  Internet only  I fucking  Wikipedia it  It's on Wikipedia  Yeah so Rock's  Theory is  He's the only guy  Who's funny or dirty  Prior  His best bit  Would be  Mudbone  Or the  I think  The Italian guys  Yeah there's a lot  Of swearing  Look  Prior had a million  Bits that are  Amazing and epic  And legendary 
[03:23:30]  And they were great  Because he did  Whatever he wanted  To  Whether if he  Wanted to be clean  He was clean  If he wanted to  Be dirty  He was dirty  I think the secret  Is be who you are  There's not  The idea of  Clean or dirty  Well if you're  Talking about  Subject matter  The idea of  Working clean  Is ridiculous  Like what  What is your  Life  I haven't  I have to do  With  Your life  Is taking a  Shit  Your life  Is eating  Food  Your life  Is getting  Into arguments  Your life  Is having  Sex  Your life  Is driving  In traffic  Your life  Is a bunch  Of fucking  Things that

[03:40:30]  Lion  Population  Up  What  Okay  Are  Sure  Like  Why  There's  A lot  Of  Them  You  Should  Be  Really  Careful  Are  There  Too  Many  Oh  Yeah  For  Sure  100%  No  Doubt  About  It  There's  Definitely  Too  Many  Mountain  Lions  There's  Too  Many  Mountain  Lions  There's  Too  Many  Wolves  In  America  As  Well  But  California  Has  A real  Mountain  Lion  Issue  Because  Mountain  Lion  Hunting  Is  Not  Legal  So  They're  Allowed  To  Just  Keep  Breeding  Slaughtering  Deer  Like  Crazy  Yeah  And  Also  Like  House  Pets  Occasionally  Oh  Yeah  Definitely  House  Pets  And  Occasionally  The  Jogger  You  Know  A 
[03:41:00]  Person  Will  Fuck  Up  They'll  Catch  A  Person  Slipping  Every  Couple  Years  And  Jack  You  Especially  A  Woman  Or  A  Child  Mountain  Lions  Are  God  Dangerous  And  California  Has  A  Large  Population  Of  Them  And  You  Can  Eat  Them  But  They  Won't  Let  You  Chitter  Chatter  And  It's  All  Just  Nice  And  Cool  To  Talk  And  We're  Sitting  In  This  You  Know  Air  Conditioned 
[03:41:30]  Room  In  The  Valley  And  You  Know  We  Have  A  Computer  In  Front  Of  Us  When  You  Are  Out  There  If  You  Are  In  The  Woods  Well  You  Shouldn't  Be  In  The  Woods  That's  Their  World  The  Fuck  It  Is  This  Whole  Planet  Our  World  Okay  And  Anywhere  People  Live  You  Through  The  Woods  Beautiful  Woods  And  You  Like  To  Enjoy  It  But  A  Mountain  Lion  Wants  To  Eat  You  That  Mountain  Lion  Can  Go  Fuck  Itself  That's  What I 
[03:42:00]  Think  I  Think  We  Should  Kill  A  Certain  Amount  Of  Them  And  Make  Sure  That  Their  Population  Well  That's  The  Point  Killing  Deer  Right  It's  Like  You  Can  Kill  Deer  Because  Yes  There's  So  Fucking  Many  Of  Deer  Pose  A  Threat  Only  In  The  Sense  That  They  Carry  Diseases  Like  You  Can  Get  A  Lot  Of  Deer  Ticks  And  Lyme  Disease  Lyme  Disease  You  Can  Get  That  You  People  Get  That  It's  Absolutely  Devastating  But  That's  Sort  Of  Like  That's  Not  Their  Fault  And  They  Also  Carry  The  Risk  Of  Auto  Accidents  It's  A  Huge  Issue  In  Places  That  Have  Farm  Land 
[03:42:30]  Like  They're  Killing  Deers  All  The  Time  It's  Antlers  You  Get  Kicked  To  Death  100%  That  Has  Absolutely  Happened  But  The  Mountain  Line  Thing  Is  They'll  Hunt  You  I  Mean  They  Really  Will  If  You're  Hiking  And  You're  Alone  And  You  Have  A  Limp  You  Twisted  Your  Ankle  And  You  Have  A  Gun  And  You  Wanted  And  This  Mountain  Line  Sees  You  Limping  And  It's  Hungry  Especially  If  It's  Old 
[03:43:00]  Cat  That  Really  Can't  Catch  Deer  Anymore  You're  Fucked  Alright  And  I  Don't  Think  That  Should  Be  The  Case  I  I  Heard  That  That's  How  They  Catch  You  Can't  Kill  One  In  Self  Defense  You  Might  Be  Able  To  Get  Away  With  It  If  You  Kill  It  In  Self  Defense  But  My  Point  Is  The  Population  Should  Be  Kept  Under  Control  They  Have  A  Good  Census  Of  How  Many  Animals  Exist  And  The  Numbers  Are  Very  High  And  They  Can't  Hunt  Them  So  The  Numbers  Are  Going  To  Continue  To  Go  Up  And  Once  Something  Becomes  Illegal  Which  I  Believe  It  Became  In  91  They 
[03:43:30]  Made  Mountain  Lion  Hunting  Illegal  It's  Very  Difficult  To  Turn  That  Around  And  Do  It  The  Other  Way  But  In  Most  States  That  Have  Mountain  Lions  They  Have  Mountain  Lion  Hunting  And  They  Have  A  Season  On  Mountain  Lions  And  It  Is  Just  To  Keep  Their  Populations  Healthy  And  In  Check  And  Not  Make  Them  Dangerous  There's  No  Concern  About  Mountain  Lions  Going  Extinct  Anybody  Who  Thinks  There  Is  Totally  Misunderstanding  What's  Going  On  Just  Completely  Incorrect  They're  They're  Dangerous  Man  Where's  This  One  Sun  Valley  Yeah  Okay  How  Big  Are  They  Well  They  Can
