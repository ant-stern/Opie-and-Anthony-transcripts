<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie recounting a luxurious weekend of blackjack at the Borgata, detailing his high-roller treatment and generous tipping.  Jimmy Norton contrasted this with a weekend spent cleaning vomit from his car after his child's projectile vomiting incident, leading to a discussion of self-induced vomiting as a hangover cure.  An attempt to interview a caller named Bobo was hampered by poor audio and his inappropriate comments.  The conversation briefly touched upon the search for Flight 370 and a Mark Cuban tweet criticizing media coverage of a college basketball coach.

A substantial portion of the show focused on "Lady Di," a previous guest who called in to report being mugged outside a Crown Chicken restaurant.  The hosts questioned her account, focusing on her evening's events, spending habits, and inconsistencies in her story.  Her boyfriend, Bill, joined the call, corroborating some details but expressing frustration with her drinking and spending. He revealed her significant drinking problem and her rapid spending of his money.  A caller, Tony, also expressed skepticism about Lady Di’s story.  Further discussion detailed Lady Di’s past, including online records of liens, judgments, a dishonorable discharge from the Navy due to AWOL, and considerable credit card debt.  She offered explanations, but the hosts remained largely incredulous.  The show also covered the death of Oderous Urungus, updates on Flight 370, a Washington State mudslide, the death of James Rebhorn, and various conspiracy theories surrounding the missing plane.  Several callers contributed to this segment, and Dominic Monaghan, Hulk Hogan, and Bobby Moynihan were mentioned as guests not present in the studio.

The show continued with a discussion of the hosts’ celebrity fans, including Bobby Moynihan, Maria Menounos, and a listener named Pat. They reminisced about past segments searching for their most famous listener, recalling calls from Sylvia Miles and a *Goodfellas* actor.  The conversation returned to Flight 370 and conspiracy theories, branching into discussions of 9/11, the Kennedy assassination, and JFK's alleged sexual exploits.

Dominic Monaghan then joined the show to promote *Wild Things*, discussing dangerous creatures featured in the upcoming season and recounting an anaconda bite.  Following Dominic, Hulk Hogan and Jimmy Hart appeared in studio to promote Wrestlemania 30. They discussed Hogan’s career, his relationship with Vince McMahon, anecdotes from *Rocky III*, and a recent incident where his charity shoes were stolen.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Wrestlemania and their long friendship.

The show then featured a shorter interview with Hulk Hogan, focusing on his future with WWE, revealing he would be at the Raw after Wrestlemania and planned to continue with WWE for "quite some time."  One host expressed Hogan was a childhood hero.  A brief discussion of Jimmy Hart's musical career with The Gentrys followed.

This was followed by an interview with Bobby Moynihan, who initially denied being a fan but then admitted to extensive past listening, recalling the "voyeur bus" incident.  The hosts recounted their arrest and media fallout from that incident.  Moynihan's SNL work was discussed at length, including a 12-12-12 benefit concert performance between Kanye West and Billy Joel, and his experiences with various SNL cast members, sketches, impressions, and encounters with celebrities like Chris Christie and Guy Fieri. He also promoted *Chosen* on FX and his upcoming stand-up shows.

The show concluded with breaking news on the missing Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 – Malaysian authorities believing it crashed in the Indian Ocean with the loss of all lives.  The hosts discussed search efforts, speculation, and the political situation in Russia and Ukraine before plugging Jimmy's stand-up shows, concluding the broadcast and transitioning to a post-show discussion.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning.  Oh, there we are.  It's broadcast time.  Here's your favorite pals.  Ja.  Everyone?  Das ja.  Ja.  Das ja.  Ja, gut.  Ja, gut.  Gut, ja.  Ah, nice stretch.  I trust.  Huh?  I trust everyone had a good weekend.  Um, yeah, it was all right. 
[00:00:30]  It was nice.  My voice is a little shot.  It sounds like, wow, you're yelling and screaming.  Blackjack.  Blackjack.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Why'd you lose your voice?  Well, I yell and scream a lot at the table.  Right.  I was doing blackjack.  Yeah.  Jimmy's mic's on.  Oh, Jimmy's mic.  Try it again.  Is there a bad chord?  Is the chord not connected?  Over there. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, Mars.  What?  You would think.  Yeah.  Move over to that one until he fixes it.  Oh, brother.  I hate using this one.  Yeah.  What happens, though?  I don't know.  Mars, what happens between...  He's tested before the show.  Uh-oh.  What happens between the time we leave here and come back?  It's just a catastrophe, apparently.  Yeah.  Anyway, Jimmy's on another mic. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  What were you saying?  Uh, no, I just was yelling, you know, what, per usual at the blackjack tables.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How'd you do?  Extra loud.  I did okay.  You did pretty good.  You did okay again.  Yeah, yeah.  No, I'm knocking wood here.  They gotta hate you down there.  Can only hope.  They just keep hating.  They want you to go down there for the big loss.  Yeah, I know.  They're waiting.  I had like eight people with me.  We had big dinners and stuff, so...  They take care of all that because you're a whale. 
[00:02:00]  I'm like...  You're a Borgata whale.  I'm a whale.  You are, though.  I was like calling him downstairs, calling the butler, going like, yeah, I need two bottles  of Grey Goose.  I need a nice Malbec.  I need a, let's get a cab up here and some charade, and then the butler just comes up.  Okay, clingety-clink.  Big breakfast in the morning, like the big table in the suite gets loaded up with eggs  and bacon and coffee and...  God, that's gotta be a huge bill that they slide under your door.  No, there's actually not a dime. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, my God.  That rules.  That is called comped.  A bit of some nice tipping going on, though, I'm sure.  Oh, yeah, you gotta, you know, you gotta take care of the butler when he comes up right  away.  Right.  You slip him some cash right away.  What's a good tip for a butler?  I never know what to tip.  I'm always afraid of an under-tip.  I give him, uh...  I give him a hundred right off the bat.  The second he walks in the door, you give him a hundred, and then at the end, you slip  him another one, two, based on how you did. 
[00:03:00]  Right.  Yeah.  Oh, good for you.  Yeah.  Another solid weekend for you.  Yeah, it was fun.  You know, my brother, all my, like, poker buddies and stuff.  Right.  We all were just fucking laughing our balls off the whole time.  It was a lot of fun.  Good times.  Good times.  I like that poor God.  I think they treat everybody really nicely.  Yeah.  Yeah, we got very similar lives, man.  It's amazing.  Oh, what, uh...  Oh, I was cleaning puke out of my car.  Jesus Christ.  Did you have a little projectile? 
[00:03:30]  And then as I was, as my head hit the pillow, I heard she puked again, and that was all  over her crib, and clothes, and pillows, and stuffed animals, and the rug, you know, really  nice rug.  So...  You have to get up there, and...  Oh, man.  You got to get up there and sop that up, get those big pieces of puke, and...  It took a solid, I don't know, hour to get that all situated.  Oh, wow.  That was wonderful, so...  We're in the car.  We're in all the seats. 
[00:04:00]  Everywhere!  Is it just everywhere?  Everywhere.  Every nook and cranny had vomit in it.  And they just don't make car seats properly, because if a kid pukes, it goes, like you  said, in all those nooks and crannies that you can't...  I might as well just throw the car seat out.  That's...  Do you wind up smelling, like, after this puke is gone, you keep checking to see if you  can smell puke?  Everywhere.  It lingers longer, so...  Very similar weekends.  Yeah, sounds it.  How was Virginia Beach, Jimmy?  It was good, but I want to hear more about the puke. 
[00:04:30]  That's about it, really.  I mean, what are you going to do?  That's one thing that infuriates the hell out of you when it happens.  What are you going to...  But there's nothing you can do.  Sucks.  Damn.  That's fucking the worst.  My own vomit's in all his bed, but someone else's vomit's...  Is it all, like, sour-y?  Yeah.  Like, you can deal with your kid's, um, uh, shit, but puke is rough.  That one I can't deal with as much.  That shit just lingers like sour milk.  It's rough.  Really rough.  Vomit is a terrible thing. 
[00:05:00]  It's terrible.  Like, it's one of my greatest...  As much as I used to throw up a lot, like, and if I have to puke, I'm good at jamming  my fingers down and making it so good.  Yeah.  Right.  Oh, it's the greatest fear I have is vomiting.  Yeah.  I don't think anyone likes it, but there are people that really just will not do it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which is bad.  There have been some great mornings of going, like, all right, time to clear this fucking  shit out of me.  Really?  Yeah.  Just knowing that it's just going to add up to awfulness, uh, the next day.  So sometimes you got to bite the old bullet and bite the old knuckles and, uh... 
[00:05:30]  You go in with your fingers?  I have to sometimes.  Aren't you too old to be doing that?  Yeah.  Okay.  Thanks for admitting it.  Jesus.  I can't imagine.  It's been a while.  I've done it.  Yeah.  But not in many years.  Wow.  It's that one moment of clarity that comes through in an evening full of drinking where  you're like, oh, shit, I overdid it.  Fuck.  This means, like, the entire day tomorrow is gone with me writhing in pain in the bed with 
[00:06:00]  a washcloth on my head.  Or, blep!  And how many hours does that take away from the hangover, you think?  Oh, it could take the entire hangover.  That's amazing, isn't it?  Yeah, yeah.  Terrible.  Now, what's your technique?  You go all the way in.  You have to go way further.  Way back.  That's the key.  Way back.  People don't go down far enough.  You gotta go way back.  They get the quick gag, like, uh...  No.  But you gotta...  The little punching bag back there in your throat?  Yeah.  It goes right between your pointer and middle finger.  Right.  And you hook down into your throat.  Oh, my God. 
[00:06:30]  And then wiggle your fingers a little.  And that's all it takes.  And then the second you start feeling gaggy, don't stop.  Oh.  It's similar to diddling a girl.  Don't stop when you think you're done.  You're hitting your own...  Because you're not yet.  You're hitting your own G-spot.  Right, right.  They come hither.  Like P-spot.  Puke.  Wow.  I don't have to do that much work.  I just gotta kind of put the fingers down and move them, and usually that will do it.  Yeah.  Why are you doing it?  And if I feel sick...  The last time I did it, if I eat something really bad and I'm getting that, like, oh, 
[00:07:00]  fuck.  You know it's happening.  There's something I ate that's really bad, or I'm just...  I got a flu or whatever, and I have to vomit.  I'll get it up just to get done.  Just to...  Because the nausea is worse than the actual puking.  This is a wonderful way to start another week of radio, isn't it?  It certainly is.  After that crazy week last week.  That was a crazy-ass week.  Overwhelmingly, the feedback was great on last week's shows.  Yes, very positive.  It worked out well.  It worked out well.  It ran its course.  Of course it did.  We finished strong on Friday. 
[00:07:30]  By Tuesday.  It really did by Tuesday.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  I love...  I guess it was Thursday when you were like...  I tapped out.  I'm done.  I tapped out.  I think it was Thursday.  Halfway through the show.  And we still had Friday left.  But then came on strong Friday.  Yeah.  We finished strong on Friday.  Is there, like, something happening with her?  There's...  Why is...  Yeah.  Bobo's in bombs.  I don't feel like doing the bit today.  I'm just going right for it.  Yeah.  Bobo, what?  Bobo.  Four sweet ladies.  Bobo, what?  Bobo. 
[00:08:00]  Hello?  Bobo.  Bobo.  Bobo.  Hello?  He just plows right into...  Why can't he...  Bobo.  Yeah, I'm here.  Lady...  Can't...  Bobo!  He's the worst.  It's terrible.  Talk to him.  He's the worst.  Terrible.  Bobo.  Yeah?  Can we start with, hi, how are you?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, how are you guys doing?  I go, hi, and he goes, bloody diapers.  I'm all right.  Yeah, he just plows right in, too. 
[00:08:30]  How about we have a little conversation?  This is a talk show.  Oh, okay.  All right, I'm hanging up on you until you do this proper.  Regroup and calls back.  Wow.  Something with Lady Di.  Yes.  I don't know exactly why.  I was hearing rumors and whatnot.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't know if they're true.  He'll call back, and hopefully we can do it proper.  Yeah.  I guess they found the plane, huh? 
[00:09:00]  It's pretty obvious now.  Hmm?  They actually got objects.  They got a boat very close to the objects.  Really?  They're about to confirm this thing, finally.  Yeah.  Spotted by who?  If it was the Chinese, I'm not believing it.  It was Australian.  Australian aircraft spots new objects in Hunt for Flight 370.  Oh, no.  And they're not going to lose those objects anytime soon.  Really?  So it's just a matter of taking a closer look. 
[00:09:30]  But they don't know if that's the plane.  They're pretty confident.  Oh, yeah?  I think this is finally it.  Yeah.  Finally.  Have they said that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  More or less.  More or less.  Bobo's on the line.  Hi, Bobo.  Hey.  Hey, good morning, guys.  How are you guys doing?  Beautiful.  Very good.  That's all I wanted.  I want to feel like I have friends out there.  Like a normal conversation.  Right.  See how nice that was, Bobo?  Yep.  I see that. 
[00:10:00]  I'm doing very well.  I had a pretty, you know, boring weekend, but well-rested and ready to go again.  How was your weekend, Bobo?  That's similar.  Similar?  Just nothing too spectacular?  No, nothing too spectacular.  See, we're teaching them people skills.  Did you see UConn?  They had a nice victory.  Yeah, I saw that.  I got some friends right up in Connecticut that make a big deal of the UConn. 
[00:10:30]  And how do you feel about Wichita?  Well, Wichita, I think it was a big upset.  I was also kind of paying attention more at the college basketball board.  They usually do because all of a sudden, because Colin wants to win that bet that that millionaire guy is doing.  Well, first of all, he's a billionaire.  And no one's going to be winning that.  No.  Everyone's out.  Something tells me Colin's undefeated so far, though, according to his Twitter.  Oh.  It looks to me like Colin might be undefeated on his way to the billion dollars so far. 
[00:11:00]  Even though there was a huge announcement that everyone is out officially.  Already?  Yeah, the last guy's out.  Yeah, no one's going to be winning, what was it, Warren Buffett's billion dollars?  How far into it are they that someone's ordered?  We're down to, we're just about at the Sweet 16, right?  Didn't the top seed get fucking dumped?  Yeah, that's why I said Wichita.  Wichita was undefeated, and their hopes of an undefeated season of 40-0 is gone as Kentucky beat them. 
[00:11:30]  That's always the way it is.  You want to lose once during the year to get it out of the way.  You want to miss once.  You want to fuck up once.  Because it's going to happen, and you don't want it to happen.  You don't want it to happen at the end, right?  When it's the end of the season for you.  Oh, boy.  Take that up with Mark Cuban.  Oh, shit.  He says that's bullshit.  Really?  He hates when people say what you just said.  Oh, shit.  That's good for him.  I hate when people say.  I just read his.  Where's his tweet?  I got it.  Close.  What were we going to say, though?  No.  Did you write it down?  Yeah. 
[00:12:00]  It won't make sense.  I'll tell you over.  Let's just say.  Here it is.  Here it is.  But it's reality.  Yeah.  It's the Daily News.  They do these sports tweets in the sports section.  M Cuban tweeted,  Which idiot media person is going to ask the Wichita State coach and players  if they thought it would have been better to lose a game pre-NCAA?  Oh, shit.  Oh, my goodness, Jimmy.  I'll tell you the reasoning behind that.  It's because when you're.  There's pressure.  There are people playing these games, and you're aware. 
[00:12:30]  Let's say you can't be undefeated.  Yeah.  But you know that you're undefeated.  And there's an additional pressure, I think, with being undefeated.  Yeah.  Every mistake is like, am I going to lose this?  Is this going to blow the streak?  I think if you've got one, it just becomes a little easier to focus on.  I actually agree with you wholeheartedly.  That's something that's out of your mind.  Like, okay.  Two.  We have a really good season, but oh, my God.  We're still undefeated.  I think that plays.  Two idiot broadcasters.  I think that plays with your mind.  Absolutely.  It's like some weird panicky thing, I think, happens. 
[00:13:00]  In your brain.  But again, maybe he's right, technically.  Like, Morton Anderson.  I'll never forget that one field goal he had missed.  He made every one all year.  And the one he missed cost him the postseason.  That's the one.  What about the Patriots?  They lose the Super Bowl after.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fuck.  That's the worst.  I wonder if that had something to do with it.  Who knows?  Who knows?  I feel like it's in your head, though.  Bobo.  Oh.  So, Wichita State lost to Kentucky, so that's it for them.  Isn't it almost, if you're doing, like, this bracket thing, aren't you almost better off 
[00:13:30]  just finding out, like, a lot of the teams, oh, there's no way to predict what teams will  be where.  Okay, that's why.  All right, yeah.  So, you just guess.  Random guesses.  Yeah, there's always some weird, you know, team that does much better than anyone expected.  And there's always a few, you know, upsets.  It's tough.  What was the score of that upset?  Was it, like, a two-point game?  I really don't know.  Was it a close game?  I have no idea.  I was watching, I watched the UConn game.  That was an exciting one.  Dude, I wish I liked college sports.  I wish I did because it's so big. 
[00:14:00]  College basketball is pretty, you could jump right on board.  These games are pretty good.  Practice.  Practice.  Practice.  So, Bobo, what do you got?  What's the breaking news?  Well, the breaking news is that all of a sudden, Lavey Dike called B, and it was  sure why she was calling me.  Bobo, Bobo, and I'm not trying to do it, but I swear, are you on a cell phone?  Yes, I'm on a cell phone.  Can you call from your mom's house phone?  I'm not busy making some call right now. 
[00:14:30]  But what happened to Lady Dike was she got mugged.  Lady Dike got mugged?  Mugged.  Yeah, she got mugged, like, probably every, her entire purse was stolen.  And for some reason, she had, she still has the paper with the phone number written down.  That's my number out of all numbers.  Still out of paper with your number on it.  Wait, wait, wait.  So, Lady Dike was mugged.  And calls you.  And calls you because that's the only number she has on her? 
[00:15:00]  Why?  Did they take her phone?  Yep.  They took her phone, just about everything.  They took just about everything.  And she just happened to have your number, so she called you.  Well, that's the start of a horror movie.  You're mugged, and that's the one phone number you have.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  The big question is, do I call this person or just kill myself now?  What the hell?  Are you serious?  Oh, I'm telling the truth here. 
[00:15:30]  She was saying she was bruised.  It was, she probably had lost everything.  She called me on Bill's phone.  How did it happen?  She just said she got mugged.  My mom had more details.  She was even thinking my mom could help her.  Help her how?  Right.  How could Bobo's mom help Lady Di?  Yeah.  She doesn't exactly have a big success history at home. 
[00:16:00]  Hold on, Mom.  They want to speak to you.  What?  Did we say that?  We're part of this phone.  When did we say that?  We didn't.  Hello?  Bobo's mom.  Yeah, it's my first name.  Hi.  What happened to Lady Di?  Yeah.  Well, she says she was mugged on the way out of a chicken place.  She went out to eat, and when she got to her truck, someone pushed her against it and 
[00:16:30]  knocked her down on the floor, and they grabbed her bag.  Where was she eating?  She was on Chicken Place in New Jersey, I think.  Uh-oh.  A chicken place.  A chicken place in New Jersey.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  World Star.  Oh, boy.  I hope it turns up on World Star.  Yeah, it'll be like the fucking puppet from Saw seen in person.  The purse had no good contents in it.  Oh, my God. 
[00:17:00]  I'm sure she was happy.  Yeah, she looked lovely.  Oh, brother.  So, she was coming out of a chicken place, because your phone's a little crappy.  She's walking back to her car, and she got mugged, and they took her pocketbook, phone, money.  Yeah, she had all that stuff there.  She had her keys in her pocket.  And she was just lucky for that, that she was able to get home.  She did report it to the police.  And that's all I know.  Wait, she reported it to the police? 
[00:17:30]  Yes, she did.  She reported it to the police.  I told her we needed a report, because she needed help getting back her license and her  certificate.  And apparently, she's not a computer, so I told her we'll help her this morning.  So, you're very involved with this.  Well, I was trying not to be, but I know she's a friend of the show, and she needs help.  And she didn't ask for money.  She did not ask for money.  Uh-huh.  Wait, what was that part? 
[00:18:00]  She didn't ask for money?  She didn't ask for money.  I offered a couple of dollars.  She didn't want any money.  So, we got to call Lady Di.  Now, we got to call what?  And she talked to Dr. Steve, so now we got to get Dr. Steve on the phone.  We were going to move on from Lady Di, but this is like, this is breaking news.  We're Pacino and the Godfather 3.  Yes, exactly.  We were out.  We were out, and we got to pull us back in.  We got pulled back in again.  It surprised me, though.  Huh?  She didn't describe what the guy looked like. 
[00:18:30]  She said she made the police description this morning.  Yeah, it sounds like a description of everybody that mugs anybody, to tell you the truth.  That's what I heard.  That's what I heard.  Oh, no.  So, they must have described the clothing, then.  Yeah, yeah.  Hoodie, jeans, and sneakers.  And she did describe it as a race, too.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, she's a black male.  Right.  Black male, mid to late 20s, wearing a hoodie.  Well, you like a nose, just a black hoodie. 
[00:19:00]  That's it.  Hoodie's up for robbery.  Do you guys have a house phone?  Your cell phone is horrible.  Oh, yes, we do, but I don't know if you don't come in there.  Sounds like she's talking through one of those paper and combs that you used to go,  wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  You're talking through a kazoo.  Do you have AT&T?  Yes, I do.  How does that company still function?  I have AT&T.  The service has gotten way better for me.  Oh, it's gotten better?  For me?  We're going to, I don't know.  We might be changing carriers again, but. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, cool.  All right.  We're not going to tell.  All right.  Mrs. Bobo's mom, thank you so much.  You're welcome.  Who am I speaking to?  Opie, Anthony, Jimmy Norton.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right, Bobo's mom.  All righty.  Thank you.  Bye-bye-bye.  All right.  We would talk to her more, but her phone is hard.  Yeah, that is a terrible phone.  Oh, God.  We've got to get Dr. Steve on the line, and should we call Lady Di's house?  I guess we've got Bill's number.  Yeah, we're calling Bill.  So we can call Bill.  Right.  Hello, Bill. 
[00:20:00]  I think this is a big cover-up.  I think it was Bill.  Lady Di.  Hi, how you doing?  Oh, look, how are you?  Lady Di.  Lady Di, we sure didn't see this coming.  I'm not good at all.  Much like you.  All right, so hold on, hold on, hold on.  Is that Jimmy in the background, right?  Yes, Jimmy's back.  So listen, Lady Di.  So you had a great week of radio with us.  Yes, I did.  The feedback was amazing for the most part.  And then Friday ended, and we all had to go our separate ways. 
[00:20:30]  So first of all, what happened Friday after the show?  Oh, no, no, no.  What happened Friday, I went over to the sub-war called Blarney Rock, and I had a few drinks.  Wait, where'd you go?  Blarney Rock.  It's a bar.  Blarney Rock.  Blarney Rock.  Yeah, Blarney Rock on 33rd Street.  I think I'm 33rd.  Tipped a couple bags.  How many beers did you have at Blarney Rock?  I had about maybe four.  Four or five.  It seems like you were four or five. 
[00:21:00]  This is why we didn't want to give you any...  Hold on.  This is why we didn't want to give you all that money at once.  This is exactly what I said would happen.  And she said, no, no, I'm not going.  I'm going right home.  You said you were going to go right home with your money.  Right.  I was going to go, but what happened was I had something to eat along with that.  I had a chicken finger along with the beer.  Then I went...  Hold on, hold on.  So four or five beers.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Slow down.  Go ahead, darling.  Slow down.  It's Monday.  So what was your bill at Blarney Rock?  Huh?  What was that?  What was the bill?  How much money did you spend there?  I don't know.  Maybe about $40?  She seems to drink...  Hold on, darling.  One second.  She seems to drink a lot around that area because that's where the Port Authority is or Penn Station.  Right.  So she seems to drink around 33rd, 34th.  Like right before she gets on the train, she goes, I'm going to have one.  Little cocktail.  And the next thing you know, it's two chicken finger dumps later and a half can of beer. 
[00:22:00]  With the rest of the commuters.  Right.  They have figured out those bars around Penn Station and Port Authority.  All right.  The Blarney Rock is a good bar.  They're cheap over there.  They are cheap.  Okay.  So then you...  It's not the Blarney Stone?  Blarney Rock.  That's the name of the place.  I think she's probably right.  It's a Flintstones bar.  Yeah.  The Blarney...  Someone else had Blarney Stone.  They went Blarney Rock.  Blarney Rubble.  Right.  That's the name of the...  That's the name of the bar.  We're in agreement.  It's fine.  So then you... 
[00:22:30]  Did you jump on a bus to go home?  No.  I paid my phone bill.  And then what I did was...  And then I got on the train and I came home.  You paid your phone bill?  Yeah.  I paid my phone bill in New York.  Yeah.  Oh.  You went to like a store and just paid your phone bill.  Good thing.  Okay.  I paid my phone bill.  All right.  Then jumped on a train.  Now where are we at?  And then I got on the train.  Yeah.  Okay.  And the conductor of the train did not tell people that are going to Elizabeth to go by 
[00:23:00]  a certain door.  Okay.  Like you have to walk up a couple of cars to go to the store.  So I winded up in Linden.  Okay.  Instead of Elizabeth.  Right.  I had to take the train.  I had to take the train back home.  So that was another $2 for me.  $2.  $40 on beer, but she's looking at the $2.  So basically it went a stop too far.  She got out and turned around.  I think it's pretty close to Elizabeth.  All right.  Go ahead.  Yeah, it is close to Elizabeth. 
[00:23:30]  Linden train station.  Okay.  All right.  I was pissed off.  I mean, come on, man.  You know, the lady should have said walk up to the bus.  Whatever.  No one cares about this part of the store.  But even when you're right, you're wrong.  And I took the cab home.  Okay.  You took the cat home?  Cab.  I took the cab.  Cab.  Oh.  Oh.  Okay.  Sorry.  I heard cat in there somehow.  What?  I was too tired to take the bus.  Who gets a shit about this part of the fucking story?  This is like Friday when you went on the after show with Sam. 
[00:24:00]  I wanted to drive my car into a pole.  You wouldn't get to the fucking point.  I like the details.  So then you took a cab home, and then what happened?  What don't you like about the bus?  Nothing happened after that.  I stayed home.  Went to bed early, because, you know, you got like five or six beers in you at this point.  Yeah.  Had a few natty ices at home.  Some chicken fingers rumbling away in her day.  Cullet.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then Saturday.  Okay.  All this happened Saturday night. 
[00:24:30]  All right.  All right.  This whole entire mugging thing happened Saturday night.  So you really did get mugged.  Yes, I got mugged.  Like, I'm telling you, do you want to talk to Bill?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No Bill today.  I want you to describe what happened.  We weren't even going to talk to you today.  Yeah.  What happened Saturday?  We need to know how this happened.  I went to the chicken place on Saturday.  Okay.  Hold on.  What's the name of the chicken place?  I went to a chicken place to get something to eat. 
[00:25:00]  What's the name of the chicken place?  No, the name is not important.  What's the name of the chicken place?  Why do you want to know the name of the chicken place?  Because you got mugged outside the chicken place.  We're trying to figure out what neighborhood it's in.  All right.  All right.  I'll let you know the name.  But, you know.  What's the name of the chicken place?  Why the fuck wouldn't she just say it?  Why weren't you popular at the Chicago Police Department?  She got mugged and we're mad at her.  But this is what happens.  What's the name of the chicken place?  Who are you protecting? 
[00:25:30]  It's called Crown Chicken.  Crown Chicken.  That's why we asked for the name.  Not fucking Popeye's even.  It's Crown Chicken.  Crown Chicken.  Crown is...  Oh, they crowned you.  Crown is definitely a chicken place you find in a lot of...  Right.  ...ghetto-y areas.  It's not a ghetto-y area.  It is...  Well, you know, that...  I don't know.  All right.  So you went to get chicken for what?  You and Bill?  Were you bringing it home?  Did he eat there?  I went...  Actually, I went to the chicken place to get... 
[00:26:00]  I looked at the menu.  I was going to get chicken.  But then I said, no, let me get something different.  Who gives a fuck?  What kind of soda were you going to get?  Calm down, Ed.  You had a great weekend.  You made some money.  Let's relax.  Yeah, I want to hear her menu debating before the mugging.  It's more important.  You decided to get one over chicken.  You know, like a...  What did I get?  Fried whiting, you know, a fish.  I got fish instead of chicken.  Oh!  Fish at crowned chicken?  Fish at crowned...  Holy shit. 
[00:26:30]  I hope they boil the hell out of that.  I'm laughing how fresh that is.  No kidding.  But anyway, so...  Probably rat.  I had my taco book.  What kind of fish do they serve at crowned...  I honestly do need to know this, because that sounds crazy.  What kind of fish is it?  You're more concerned about the food.  What happened to the fish?  What kind of fish?  Whiting!  I just told you that!  But is it...  How is it prepared?  No, what fish was it?  It was whiting.  It's all prepared the same way. 
[00:27:00]  I don't know what that means.  I have a trout dog.  Whiting.  That's what a whiting.  A clam witch.  It's a whiting?  Whiting.  That's what they said when they saw you standing outside.  Alright, so you didn't eat in crowned chicken.  I did too.  I ate whatever I could, and I decided to take the rest home, so I had it wrapped up.  Oh my god.  Alright, that's why...  Okay.  So you're sitting there eating.  Yes.  Yes.  Somebody was watching you.  Someone saw the zebra at the watering hole.  Somebody watched... 
[00:27:30]  The hippo at the watering hole.  Somebody watched and realized, yeah, that the hippo had a bad leg.  It's limping by the watering hole.  What were you doing at crowned chicken that would have made someone think that maybe you  were an easy target?  Were you counting your money at the table that you made, or...?  No, no.  Maybe when I took out the money to pay for the chicken, maybe they saw the rest of it.  What'd you take out?  Like a couple of hundreds?  They saw the rest of it when I took the money out. 
[00:28:00]  Maybe they overlooked.  Were you flashing some hundies?  Were you flashing some hundreds?  No, I wasn't flashing anything.  How much did you guys give her?  I wasn't here.  It turned out to be almost $400, I think.  $400 cash on Friday, not counting all the money we gave during the week.  You know what, guys?  Guys, please.  If you don't listen to me, alright, I'm not going to finish the story.  You're right.  You know what?  You know what?  You fucking piece of shit.  She's right.  With your fucking bullshit details.  What do you mean you're not going to finish the story? 
[00:28:30]  We're trying to help you.  You're right, Dad.  We apologize for our rude interruptions.  And our crash talk.  So somebody might have seen you pulling out a lot of money to pay for your meal at Crown  Chicken.  It could be, but I don't think I pulled out all that money.  Alright, so nothing else at Crown Chicken that would have been suspicious.  I don't know.  I mean, you know, let's put it this way.  If I wasn't there, somebody else would have been the target.  Well, that's usually the case, yes. 
[00:29:00]  Weasley was waiting for somebody to open up a pocketbook, and it happened to be me.  Okay, so then you leave Crown Chicken.  Now, walk us through this.  Now, I left Crown Chicken, okay, and I was walking towards the liquor store.  Now, I'm not going to lie to you.  I was going to get a 30-pack.  Alright?  And, you know, I was going to get something for Bill.  I was going to get him a couple of six-packs.  Can I ask you, is this the famous liquor store you've talked about? 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Okay, don't name him.  Don't name this place anymore.  They don't take care of you.  No, they have nothing to do with that.  But they don't take care of you, so don't mention the name.  Alright, so you're going there to get a 30-pack.  And is this close to the Crown Chicken?  Yes.  Okay.  The Crown Chicken is about two doors down.  Oh, okay.  Alright.  So you're not going back to your car yet.  So you go to the liquor store, and what happens?  No, I didn't even make the liquor store.  The guy mugged me already.  And then I call the cops and everything.  Wait, no, no.  You don't just stop and mugged me. 
[00:30:00]  You go through the detail of the menu at Crown Chicken, but then you go, he mugged me,  and I call the cops.  Walk us through the mugging, you fuck.  I'm not going to do most of the talking.  I'm trying to talk.  I know.  No.  That's right.  No.  No.  No.  I'm just trying to make sure we get the details of the story.  So you leave Crown Chicken.  What happens?  I got mugged right there on the sidewalk.  Right outside the door?  Right outside.  I was walking down. 
[00:30:30]  Maybe I took about four steps and boom, boom, boom, the sky copy.  What did he do?  What did he say?  What did he do?  What happened to you?  Were there people around?  What time of day was this?  Now we want details.  Right.  You won't fucking get up.  Did you have the potatoes with gravy?  Go ahead.  What time is this at?  This was about 9.30 at Saturday night.  You're crazy.  Going to a Crown Chicken at 9.30 at night.  So what happened?  What happened?  He ran.  He ran with my pocketbook. 
[00:31:00]  No.  What the?  Holy shit.  I swear to God.  Why does this happen?  What happened?  How did he mug you?  Describe the mugging.  He ran behind me.  Right.  All right.  Pushed me down to the ground.  Took my pocketbook and ran the other way.  The opposite way.  Okay.  Were you the only, let me ask you, were you the only white person in the Crown Chicken  or was it a pretty mixed place?  I would say I was the only white person in there.  Exactly.  But you actually sat there and.  Except for the person. 
[00:31:30]  Except for the manager.  Of course.  So you didn't feel like uncomfortable at all?  Or like you'd eaten there before?  No.  I ate there before.  Okay.  I never thought something like this would happen.  I ate there before.  I mean, you know.  All right.  We heard you.  All right.  All right.  All right.  I'm not accusing you of not eating there before.  Yeah.  So the guy, it was quick.  He pushed you, grabbed your pocketbook, and ran.  And was there any witnesses to this?  Yes, there was.  Who?  There was people out.  There were witnesses.  Were they laughing?  I had no business being out on my 39th. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  Well, I know that.  I know I had no business being out.  You have to be a refrigerator.  You have to be a refrigerator.  You don't need another 30th back.  Yeah, he's...  Fucking drink.  Okay.  That was...  We now need Bill on the phone.  Can you give us Bill for a second?  And we'll go back to you.  He's not a very happy person.  So I...  Oh, you don't need it.  Why would he be?  Look where he lives.  No.  What?  Nothing.  Let us talk to Bill for a second.  Oh, you're not going to like this, guys. 
[00:32:30]  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Hold on.  Good.  I thought we were going to move on from Lady Di.  I know.  But she got mugged.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What are you doing?  God, Bill.  I'm sorry to hear about Lady Di.  That's crazy.  She's out at 9.30 at night on a Saturday at a Crown Chicken?  Yeah.  And it's not a good neighborhood at...  Of course not.  Say, at nighttime.  Right, right.  So...  Okay, you got the Maverloch Manor there. 
[00:33:00]  It's all drugs, all life, whatever.  Uh-huh.  Why would she go there?  Isn't there other places to go to eat?  Well, actually, the reason why I'm really pissed off...  Yep.  She had 28 cans of beer in a refrigerator.  She's fucking drunk.  Get to my fucking truck and drive.  Oh, boy.  She drove your truck?  Yeah.  And so she felt like she needed more beer, even though there were 28 cans in the refrigerator. 
[00:33:30]  Yep.  And then she gets mugged on the sidewalk, pretty much right outside the Crown Chicken.  No, it's actually...  I don't know what it is.  I don't go that way.  It's like a couple of doors down from the liquor store.  Right.  Man.  And I was sleeping.  And, you know, she does this all the time.  She sneaks out.  I know when she goes out because of my truck keys. 
[00:34:00]  I put them a certain way.  Uh-huh.  I know when she goes out, when she comes in.  So she's sitting at home.  She's getting lit up.  And then she decides she needs more beer, even though there's beer in the fridge.  So she hops in your vehicle all drunk.  Yep.  And someone sees her staggering around drunk.  I'm sure.  They're going to just grab her pocketbook.  Oh, yeah.  Well, because you're an easy hit.  Right.  You're an easy hit.  All I got to do is push her.  You fall down.  Yep.  Push her.  She falls down. 
[00:34:30]  You grab the pocketbook.  And you're out of there within seconds.  She is a victim.  Perpetual victim.  It's like blowing out a candle.  You know what I'm saying?  Yes.  He's so mad.  I love it.  I'm sorry, Bill.  That sounds awful, man.  Fat candle.  Oh, God.  Anything else you want to add to the story?  What?  I ain't going to say nothing about that. 
[00:35:00]  A lot of them got Drey Locks.  A lot of them.  A lot of them have Drey Locks, huh?  Yeah, right.  I hear you.  She really thinks she's got a description?  I would love to hear Lady Di's description of the guy.  Oh, yeah.  Let's...  Can we get her back on the phone?  Can we talk to Di again?  No, no, no.  No, this is funny.  Yeah.  You had a hoodie on with Drey Locks.  Drey Locks.  He had Drey Locks.  Drey Locks and a hoodie. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  And Lady Di thinks she's got a description, is what you're saying.  Yeah.  Well, like I said, she does stupid shit when she's drunk.  Well, and now she lost her phone with all her contacts and...  Oh, what a nightmare.  Yeah.  And that's the whole problem.  You know, she went over to your show last week, okay?  Mm-hmm.  You know, I didn't mind that at all. 
[00:36:00]  Okay.  She's going over there, whatever.  You guys are her friends.  She liked doing it, whatever it is.  You know, she spent close to $500 going back and forth.  Ugh.  No, well, maybe...  No.  No, it was $300 because you had $300 in her accounts, which I put money in.  What?  It's not going to cost $300 for one week of getting...  Yeah, it doesn't cost that much to go back and forth from Elizabeth to New York.  I think she was fibbing you because she wanted to stop and have a few belts. 
[00:36:30]  Exactly.  Yeah, I don't think it's...  It's called alcohol.  Okay?  Yeah, right.  She's a drink in New York, you're paying $8, $9, $10 a beer.  Exactly.  Okay, and she was drinking the 22-ounce Friday pints, instead of these 16-ounce, and you drink  four or five of them, you've got to be halfway shit-faced.  Bill, we're starting to think she has a drinking problem.  Yeah, we're trying to figure it out. 
[00:37:00]  Well, actually, I met her, I met her like seven years ago.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Where'd you meet her?  The TB ward?  So you meet her seven years ago?  Yeah, she was homeless.  Took her off the street.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  We remember that.  Yeah, we were...  Yeah, okay.  I'm not lying on it.  Whatever.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I know.  I got a good job.  Yeah.  I'm making a couple thousand a week.  Mm-hmm.  You know, and she lived with me and my buddy Jeff. 
[00:37:30]  We had a room.  I lost my house.  Boy, I ain't talking about that.  All right.  No, I used to get her, you know, a 12-pack a day, and that was cool.  And she was all right.  But when she got her father's money, okay?  Yeah.  She was drinking 30, 36 cans of beer a day.  Holy shit.  36 cans of beer a day.  Now we're getting to the bottom of this.  Yeah, yeah.  Bill, there's no way she was drinking that many beers a day. 
[00:38:00]  Want to make a bet?  No, I'm just...  I bet she was.  Bet she kissed.  I'm just saying it in a way like I can't believe it, but I guess it's got to be true.  It is.  I believe it.  30 to 36 cans a day?  If you start at 8, 9 in the morning.  Wow.  Probably very easy to.  No, that's late.  That's late, huh?  7, 6.  6, 7 in the morning.  Hey, Bill, let me ask you a question.  Does she vomit in the sink in the bathroom? 
[00:38:30]  Cool.  Yeah.  So, did you ever just walk in there and find the vomit in the sink?  Well, right now, she wakes up every day like that.  Yeah.  What?  Sick?  Pukes.  Yeah, well, I cut her down.  She got her father's money.  She went over the hill.  Oh, yeah.  And she went through that money fast, right, Bill? 
[00:39:00]  She went through the money fast?  About 10 months.  Is she displaying fiscal irresponsibility?  She went through 60,000 in 10 months.  No, no, no.  It was 30.  Oh, 30.  I think she said 60, one point.  Okay, 30,000.  She got 15 in 15.  15 the first time and after the, I don't know, what do you call that shit?  I don't know.  Whoa.  Just sounds like a disaster.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:39:30]  And then, you know, I cut her down.  And when she started doing, I give her money for a 12-pack.  That's a lot of hours, a 12-pack.  Uh-huh.  Like when I got out of the hospital, her and Lisa were living here.  I didn't drink for two years.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  This is Kessel.  Why were you in the hospital, Bill?  Oh, I had a cyst on my pancreas.  Jesus.  Yeah.  I was in there three weeks. 
[00:40:00]  Three and a half weeks.  And then you didn't drink for two years.  And then you thought you were doing her a favor by cutting her down to a 12-pack a day.  That's a lot of beer.  Yeah, that's a lot.  That is a lot.  Why'd you start again?  That's what, 84 cans a week almost.  Why'd you start drinking again?  And that's the cut down.  Yeah, why'd you start drinking again?  Well, it was my birthday last year.  Right?  And I was a barbecue and having a good time.  So I picked up a beer. 
[00:40:30]  Okay.  Really, I said, I drank this shit.  I didn't like it.  Uh-huh.  Okay?  So anyway, I just got to, well, getting bored.  Okay?  Just bored, so a little drinking.  Right.  You know?  All right.  Two six-packs in literally two and a half days.  Well, then fast forward, you're back drinking pretty heavily again.  What, three, four beers a day? 
[00:41:00]  Oh, that's all you're doing right now?  Yeah.  And then what?  Dye drinks the rest, right?  Right.  All right.  So let's get a lady.  No, she don't touch my beer.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Let's get Lady Dye back in the phone.  I want to hear her description of the mugger.  Oh, a hoodie with Draylock.  So you all got them.  Who's day, Bill?  What?  Who has them?  Give her a couple of beers. 
[00:41:30]  Just open it up.  All right.  All right.  Thanks, Bill.  Thanks for sharing the backstory on this.  This.  This.  This.  Yeah.  Dye.  Dye.  We got to move on.  Dye.  Talk to me.  Dye.  I'll be right there.  You don't need a beer that quick.  What?  She's grabbing a beer.  She's got to get a beer?  Yeah, yeah.  She is a fucking disaster.  It's a fucking disaster.  She's a disaster.  It's 7.15 in the morning.  Okay, I'm back.  Why did you have to grab a beer?  How many beers have you had so far? 
[00:42:00]  I only had the one.  I just woke up a little while ago.  Exactly.  How about you start with a cup of coffee?  Right.  Some juice.  Coffee.  Orange juice.  Water.  Something.  Water.  So Bill said you have the description of the guy, but he kind of laughed.  What's the description of the mugger?  A good description.  Right.  He has, well, he has socks.  Okay.  He was wearing a hoodie.  Yeah.  A gray hoodie.  Okay.  And he had blue jeans, you know, blue jeans on. 
[00:42:30]  And he was a fast runner.  So, you know, that's the only thing I have to say about him.  So they're never going to find the guy.  You didn't describe.  No, no, no, no.  You didn't describe skin color.  He was getting something for himself, okay?  And, you know, the booth was taken.  They only have one booth in that place.  And I was eating at the counter until the booth was clear.  So he must have sold my pocketbook.  Wait, you saw the guy in the store first?  Yes.  He was in there first. 
[00:43:00]  Okay.  People were telling me he was in there with a few other people, okay?  And these people, instead of running after the guy, okay, you know, because I ran around  the corner.  I'm like, where did he go?  And he just, like, disappeared.  Love to see that.  In other words, you couldn't see him anymore.  He ran.  He's like a fast runner.  Right.  You know?  And everybody's just standing there.  They're like, what happened?  What happened?  I said, well, what do you think happened?  They're standing there like a bunch of jerks doing nothing. 
[00:43:30]  They're like, oh, I feel bad for you.  Yeah, well, you feel bad for me.  What'd you want them to do?  Yeah, run after him.  They're not going to run after the guy.  No one.  Sadly.  They're waiting for their own victims.  Sadly, no one really helps you out when you need them.  You know, I mean, they just stood there.  They're like, what happened?  I said, didn't you just see it?  What happened to you?  I just got mugged.  All right.  And they're just standing there like nothing happened, you know?  Well, in that town, it is nothing.  And, well, they probably did not want to get involved. 
[00:44:00]  You think?  Probably.  You're never going to find the guy.  No.  Well, whatever.  So what did they, he got your pocketbook, your phone, how much money, what else was in  the pocketbook?  Oh, we went through the pocketbook, so we should know.  There wasn't much in there.  Well, I don't know.  My credit card, but I already, I took care of that already.  Right.  The phone, I had that temporarily shut off.  Right.  Okay.  I'm going to get another phone probably today.  Right, Bill?  Yeah.  All right.  Uh-oh. 
[00:44:30]  Bill's going to pay for it.  Yeah.  Well, and now it's Bill's money that I have to count on.  And that really sucks.  Now, you know, the money, okay.  I understand.  He wants money.  This person wanted money for whatever he was going to do that night.  Oh, I'm sure.  It's help.  Buy books for school.  Yeah, books.  Yeah, whatever.  Helping crippled children.  I'm not going to speculate, but I really think it's going to be for doing drugs.  Okay?  That's speculating.  That's speculating.  You can't say I'm not going to speculate.  I meant speculating.  That doesn't work. 
[00:45:00]  Do you want to know the amount I had in my pocketbook?  Yes.  I would say over $200.  Pretty much the rest of the money that we gave her.  Because, you know, I really think it's going to happen.  And I said this was going to happen.  Maybe not a mugging, but I said, I don't know why we're giving her all this money.  It's going to be gone.  I said it's going to be gone by Monday.  I said that.  You can pull the tape.  Well, we knew it would happen some way.  You're a perpetual victim.  Right.  You knew I was going to get mugged.  I didn't say that.  I said you would go through all your money by Monday. 
[00:45:30]  I said it on this show.  No, I would have still had it.  I would have still had it.  You were down at $200.  Already half of it was gone.  Right.  And that was only Saturday night.  Either way, that money was going to be gone by Monday morning.  You'd have bought that 12-pack and then the 30-pack.  I took my phone bill in New York, okay?  When I was in New York, I paid my bill.  Good thing you paid that phone bill so the phone could get stolen.  And now, all of a sudden, I don't have a phone anymore. 
[00:46:00]  Ain't that great the way it works out like that?  No.  I know.  That's sort of what Anthony just said.  It's horrible.  I'm sorry.  You know what I mean?  I'm sorry for you, Lady Di.  This is horrible news.  I was sick all day yesterday.  And I have to go through the insurance company to get another phone.  Well, you're sick because of your alcoholism, not because you were mugged.  Yeah.  What?  Excuse me?  I heard you drove Bill's truck all drunk.  No, no, no, no, no.  Yes, yes, yes, yes. 
[00:46:30]  He said that.  Wait, wait.  He said you got all lit up and then went out to buy more beer and you were drunk driving  his truck.  If I was ossified, I wouldn't be behind the wheel of that truck.  Ossified.  If I...  No, I was not.  People think she's lying.  So you only had a few beers.  She's not lying about the mugging.  That's pretty obvious.  It's okay to drive, okay?  Okay to drive.  Boy, she's going to kill somebody.  A few people think she's lying.  Now, let me think this over.  I'm not lying.  Why?  She spends all her money, but she can't tell Bill. 
[00:47:00]  Uh-huh.  You're not lying, right?  What?  What was that?  Some people think you're lying about the mugging to cover up the fact that you spent all the  money.  I don't care what they think.  It's the truth.  And what is Marion saying about this?  Well, Marion feels bad for me about this.  She said that she can't believe that that happened to me.  Exactly.  And I said, look, do you want me to come in there one day with a police report to prove  to everybody or mail it to you or something?  No, I believe you.  To prove to you that I was mugged? 
[00:47:30]  I said, no, I believe you.  All right, see you tomorrow.  Okay, well, then you better, you know, it's the truth.  It's the truth.  It is not a good neighborhood around there.  Yeah, no shit.  And I was the target.  If it wasn't me, somebody else was the target.  Yeah, maybe not.  What happened to the chicken?  There were people.  Oh, my God, man.  There were people getting food over there.  You're a white person.  You don't belong there.  You're a white person.  You don't belong there.  He says, I like Bill. 
[00:48:00]  He makes sense.  Bill.  Yeah, what were you doing?  You know what?  I was getting food.  You know whitey's always the victim.  Yep.  Well, I had no business doing that, yeah, but.  I had no business getting another one.  She was down there trolling for dick.  That's what she was doing.  Oh, yeah, some big black hog.  I was in the mood to get some chicken.  All right.  All drunk.  And then I walked out. 
[00:48:30]  No more money.  No nothing.  All I did was go home.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Dallas wants in.  Tony in Dallas.  You're on with Lady Di.  What's up?  There is no doubt that she spent all that money as she came up with a BS story.  And probably within the next week, that phone will just mysteriously appear.  Uh-huh.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Stop.  All right.  All right.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  He already said what he said.  He doesn't believe your story.  He thinks you made it up because you spent all the money. 
[00:49:00]  First of all, where would I spend all the money all at once at?  On beer.  On beer.  Not at the gym.  That's impossible.  That is impossible.  It is not.  All right.  It's not impossible.  You spent half of it on beer on the first day of the weekend.  Oh, God.  Yes.  I paid my phone bill $65.  $65.  All right.  And then another $40, $50 on beers.  And then she jumps on the old train.  I'm listening. 
[00:49:30]  Listen to me.  All right.  I went to the Blarney Rock.  So belligerent.  I had a few beers there because they're cheap over there anyway.  They're good over there.  I took the subway to the Blarney.  Blarney Rock.  Right?  Okay.  We got all the details.  Thank you.  All right.  We heard this already.  All right.  If there's nothing.  Two beers in the Blarney Rock.  We got all this already.  Okay.  All right.  But I'm trying to explain.  We're pretty much done.  Blarney Rock over our head.  Yeah.  We heard everything.  I had chicken fingers because now I'm starting to get my appetite.  Well, where did you actually go after the radio show on the subway?  No. 
[00:50:00]  Jerry.  Jerry.  What place did you drink out in the city?  Oh, my God.  Don't do this.  Forget it.  Forget it.  Forget it.  Forget it.  Put the money out of the till.  Remember, we did.  I was like annoyed with that till.  We did five days with Lady Di.  Yeah, you only did four.  Okay.  A domestic.  Go as an axe.  Okay.  All right.  What does Bill say?  Oh, something about the first 140. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, I bet you drank away.  Yeah, you drank that away.  That's when we realized maybe we should cut down the funds a little bit.  The what?  Cut down what a little bit?  Oh, boy.  The day we gave you 140, it was gone the next day.  We started thinking, wow, okay, maybe we shouldn't just be throwing money at her.  That was my fault.  Oh, really?  Well.  That was definitely my fault.  Hey, what's the place you drank out in the city?  What place did you drink out in the city?  I just told you. 
[00:51:00]  The Blarney Rock.  Oh, my God.  Blarney Rock.  Oh, my God.  You never heard of the Blarney Rock?  Oh, my God.  With the Blarney Rock.  Where is it?  It's an Amish bar.  Look, look.  I know the people in there.  What, the Shamrock?  The Blarney.  Blarney Rock.  How do you know the people at the Blarney Rock?  I've been going there for years.  Marion and I have been going there for a long time.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Well, are we done with her?  Oh, my God.  We know the bartenders and stuff. 
[00:51:30]  The barmates.  That's great.  The waitresses.  All right, everybody.  The janitor.  The fucking guy that cleans the windows.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Sean in Long Island actually grew up right where Lady Di was bugged.  If you're just tuning in, Lady Di was bugged over the weekend.  We were going to move on from Lady Di.  But obviously we have to see what this is all about.  Sean, what do you got?  Poor shit.  Hey, guys.  That me?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, no, I didn't grow up there. 
[00:52:00]  I went to college there for three years right down the street.  What college is nearby?  Kane University.  Okay.  Right in here.  Okay.  I don't want that.  I had a college house there for three years right down the street.  Used to go to that liquor store that she's talking about and everything.  Okay.  Go ahead, Di.  There's no way that she's lying.  She's not lying.  Okay.  This is the worst neighborhood ever.  You know, those guys just hang out outside that store all day, all night.  And they're just looking for people like her.  I'm actually a white kid, too.  So they were looking for people like us, but we were a little smarter than that. 
[00:52:30]  Exactly.  She's just walking around like a dummy.  Yeah, she's drinking a cheers here in New York.  Yeah, no.  There's no way she's lying.  They just look for people like us.  And if she's drunk and staggering a little bit and her pocketbook's all willy-nilly like she is.  And then the guy looked at her, saw the money, she's pulling it out.  Right.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  We never left our house.  She did everything wrong, I bet.  I mean, everything you can do wrong, she did wrong that day.  Everything you can do wrong.  Everything.  Yeah.  Yeah, since 1960. 
[00:53:00]  Instead of like maybe pulling out a 20 out of the wad, she pulls the whole wad of money  out.  Wad out.  I'll take some chicken.  Boring.  How do you guys know that?  Were you with me?  Yes, we were with you for one week.  How do I know this?  You're not an enigma.  She goes, how do you know this?  Because you told us.  That it robbed or wasn't.  I opened up my pocketbook, you probably saw, looked inside, saw the money, and I don't  even know it, okay?  I pulled out whatever I had to do.  All right, goodbye. 
[00:53:30]  All right.  I have had it with this.  I'm done with her.  Had it with her.  Goodbye, die.  Be well.  We wish you well.  Take care.  Had it.  God, Steve.  All right, let her die.  Well, what can I tell you?  I mean...  You've told us everything.  You won't tell us what you drank in the city, but you told us everything else.  Don't say it.  Please don't say it.  I am bruised.  My elbow...  She's bruised.  And my knee is bruised.  Okay.  So is your liver, by the way.  Exactly.  Might as well add that to the list. 
[00:54:00]  Poor little fat apple.  Her weeping liver.  It's weeping into her abdomen.  Yes.  Building a flood.  Who gets so bruised by getting pushed down?  Exactly.  I got bruised by being pushed down, yes?  So you got a bruised elbow and a bruised what?  Knee?  Yeah, bruised me.  All right.  I hope you're doing well.  Not funny.  Godspeed.  We didn't say it was funny.  Yes.  That guy that did it probably was like, this has to be a setup.  Like, this has to be a cop sting.  Right.  Because it's too easy.  You know, I mean... 
[00:54:30]  But he's like, I got to give it a shot, though.  This...  What?  Someone Twittered, ONA Blarney Rock.  ONA Blarney Rock.  Listen, I need to ask you a question.  Oh, no.  We're not hiring.  No, really.  Seriously.  What do you need for your driver's license?  You need proof of address?  How about the ability to drive sober?  Yeah.  How about that for first...  For one?  Yeah.  I would start there.  Take care, Dye.  I'm asking you a serious question.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I'm not the DMV.  Yeah, what the fuck do you think we are?  I don't know. 
[00:55:00]  You need two pieces of identification.  Right.  Like what?  Like what?  Bring your license.  Everything...  Everything that was in your pocketbook.  Yeah.  Yeah, pretty much.  Proof of where you live, I think.  I think, like, a pay stub helps.  I don't know.  A phone bill.  Maybe a birth certificate.  That type of shit.  I don't have my birth certificate.  Yeah, you're in...  You're gonna be...  It's gonna be a problem.  A passport?  Right.  Yeah.  Where's your passport?  The police report itself, right? 
[00:55:30]  Uh-huh.  All right, hold on.  I'm going to Dr. Joe in Minnesota.  Dr. Joe, you're on with Lady Di.  Oh, hey, guys.  Let me take Lady Di off your hands for you.  I've got a job opportunity for her.  Yeah.  Have you ever heard of Scared Straight?  Scared Straight?  No.  Yeah, so Scared Straight is to help kids that are fucking up become better people.  So we're gonna use you to scare these kids. 
[00:56:00]  There you go.  How would you feel about teenage boys changing your diapers so that way they see what alcoholism can do?  Oh, brother, please.  Hey, I'm a doctor.  I am a doctor.  Not like Dr. Shane.  More like Dr. Pepper or Dr. Dre.  But I'm still a doctor.  All right, Dr. Joe.  Shane, listen.  Unfortunately, we had to.  I'm getting this from somebody.  Ask her why she has so many liens and judgments against her. 
[00:56:30]  What were they for?  Oh.  Lady Di.  What happened?  Say that one more time.  What'd you say?  She had to take a sip.  You heard that, right?  Uh-huh.  Why do you have so many liens and judgments against you?  Liens and judgments against me?  I don't know.  I don't know why.  I don't know why.  But do you have them?  I'm just being myself.  And if these people want to judge me, let them judge me.  Oh, no. 
[00:57:00]  I can't.  Oh, my God.  I can't.  This isn't real.  Liens?  Well, that's from the alcoholism and the judgment.  Liens and judgment.  Well, I am on Twitter, so you're going to get a little of that.  Oh, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Passing bad checks?  Proof of, you know, proof to get my driver's license back.  What about my checkbook?  We're not talking about that anymore.  Yeah, bring your license with you.  You can find it.  Give me some more.  We're more available.  Done with this mess. 
[00:57:30]  We did what we could.  Fucking won't stop.  No, no.  This is why you just don't get involved in the end.  No, no.  You don't.  You just don't, unfortunately.  I mean, that's probably horrible to say, but this is what happens when you do try to  get involved and help somebody out.  I already got proof of address.  I bet I already got.  But what about the liens and judgments against you?  That's court stuff.  There's some legal things against you?  Right.  Like what? 
[00:58:00]  I don't know.  You tell me.  I don't know.  Maybe this person could give me a little more info than just that.  Reliable source, by the way.  Lady Di, you're a goddamn mess.  You don't want help.  You're just going to continue to wither away.  How did you get home?  Considering the guy took your car keys.  He didn't take my car keys.  Where were they?  They were in my jacket.  Thank God.  Oh, okay.  They were in my jacket.  Otherwise, those would have been gone, too. 
[00:58:30]  Bill would have flipped shit.  Wasn't that Bill's car?  Huh?  Wasn't that Bill's car?  It's our car.  It's our truck.  It's both of ours.  Yeah, it's Bill's.  It's our truck.  You drive it drunk.  I was not drunk.  That's what I'm trying to tell you.  Bill said you were drunk.  And that's why you left the house in the first place.  To go get beer, even though the fridge was full of beer.  You went out, and then you decide you want chicken.  So you go to the fucking...  You go to Compton for fucking chicken. 
[00:59:00]  No.  No.  No.  No.  Yes, yes, yes.  I want to get beer for the next day.  Beer for the next day while she's drinking beer that night.  Right.  You are a goddamn disaster.  Oh, there we go.  Yeah, well...  Lady Di.  Yes.  Yes.  Judgment and liens.  Oh.  All these?  Judgment and liens.  What is judgments and liens?  There's ten of them.  No, no.  You tell me. 
[00:59:30]  Ten against you.  Public records.  Statewide.  Personal search.  You've got a lot of judgments and liens against you.  There's ten of them.  Ten of them?  So let me know what they are, because I don't even know what they are.  Well, it doesn't really say.  It doesn't really say.  Okay.  Well, if it doesn't say, then, hey...  What does that mean?  People are looking for...  Yeah, she owes money to things.  Right.  She's, yeah. 
[01:00:00]  A lot of, probably, bad checks, credit, you didn't pay back, things like that.  There's ten of them, so...  But you have no idea.  Credit cards you never paid.  Apparently a lot from...  Is that true?  Yeah.  Apparently a lot from Capital One and the heating company.  You're not paying your heating bill.  What are you talking about?  And Capital One.  Capital One.  You know, credit card.  You probably chalked up a bunch of credit card debt and then just threw the credit cards away. 
[01:00:30]  Right?  That was a long time ago.  See?  That was a long time ago.  She goes from, what are you talking about, to...  That was a long time ago.  Overdrawn accounts at the bank.  Wait.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Wait a minute.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  Yeah.  What?  Okay, wait a minute.  How in the world did you find all this stuff out?  It's very easy.  It's the internet.  It's 2014.  People's information is available everywhere. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, jeez.  That was such...  Oh, my God.  I thought I took care of all that.  Oh, did you?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think I did.  And what about bank accounts that were overdrawn?  And...  No, no.  What?  Bank accounts are overdrawn?  No.  Yeah.  No way.  Like you overdraw a bank account and then just never...  We're getting...  We're getting what they are.  Yeah.  If you wait, like, literally 15 more seconds.  Uh-huh.  They're coming off the printer.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Lady Di.  There's always another...  There's always another layer with you, Lady Di. 
[01:01:30]  There's always something else.  Oh, yeah.  We go a whole week and you don't even tell us that you were in the Navy.  Yeah, you didn't even tell us that.  Well, I didn't think that was important.  She's in the fucking Navy.  That's an important subject.  And that you were AWOL.  That you got a dishonorable discharge because you were AWOL.  Russ.  Oh, God.  I just did not think that that was important.  Ah, ha, ha, shit. 
[01:02:00]  Well, anyway...  Yeah, I wasn't a service.  Yes, I was.  Right.  Yeah.  I wasn't there for two years.  And then they threw you out.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, yeah, they did.  I didn't want to get thrown out, though.  I just wanted to, uh...  Why did they throw you out?  What was their reasoning?  They threw me out because I was just leaving the base all the time.  I had unlimited liberty, which is probably their mistake, if you ask me.  Wait, she had unlimited liberty, so then it's okay to leave the base? 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, it is.  You have unlimited liberty.  You can leave the base any time you want to.  So what was the...  Oh, you were coming back drunk or something?  No.  I wasn't a drinker back then.  No.  Why did they throw you out of the Navy?  I just wanted to leave the base.  I did not want to be there.  That's all.  Why did they throw you out of the Navy?  They threw me out because I was able all the time.  So when I came back, they said, listen, you know, we're going to have to discharge you, you know. 
[01:03:00]  So they had to discharge me.  I'm just waiting for the record.  So we can move on.  The stock is dropping the more she talks.  Yes.  I was young back then, you know.  And what's your excuse now?  Young and full of cum, right?  You're so much wiser now.  Yeah.  All right.  Something like that.  Whatever.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  But I really wanted to stick it out.  I wanted to stay in there.  But they just said, here, you have to go home. 
[01:03:30]  You didn't want to stick it out.  You didn't want to be part of it, really, if you're leaving all the time.  Yeah, I know.  But I did not want to.  See, I was only 19 years old.  Here it comes.  I was just stolen.  I was barely out of high school.  Okay?  I was out of high school.  All right?  19 years old.  Okay?  All right.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  I graduated high school.  Oh, boy.  Capital One.  All right.  Here.  Let's see.  We got some fun things.  Oh, my God.  We're listening.  Wait.  Hold on.  Forget it. 
[01:04:00]  Forget it.  We're listening.  We're listening.  Capital One does not like you.  What?  Capital One.  Capital One.  Capital One.  Wow.  Petro Heating Oil and Services.  Crown Asset Management.  LLC.  They're pulling up old files on me.  Bill.  Oh, my God.  Century Financial Service.  Midland Funding.  Oh, boy. 
[01:04:30]  Put E-Rock on the phone.  Huh?  Put E-Rock on the phone.  What?  Why E-Rock?  Okay.  Hold on.  Huh?  Put E-Rock on the phone.  Lady Di.  It's me.  It's E-Rock.  Yeah.  Hi, E-Rock.  How you doing?  Hey.  Why?  Wait.  What?  Hold on a second.  Hold on.  Why are you pulling up all this stuff on me?  You know, I just figured I would do it because I have access to it and the NSA stuff, so I  figured I would just do it.  Yeah, but now it's all over the air. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, I know, but I figured, what the heck?  Oh, God.  You see the amounts?  Are they all different amounts?  $8,900.  The first one is for $9,200, Capital One.  The second one is for $9,200, Capital One.  The third is for $8,900 from Capital One.  Wait, Opie, do you think it's the same one with interest just being added?  I'm not sure.  I don't think so.  I think it's the same one with interest being added.  And then the heating oil, that's for $700.  I don't think they're the same because they have different filing numbers.  Oh, my God. 
[01:05:30]  Then there's Crown Asset Management for $3,300.  Another Crown Asset Management for around the same, $3,300.  No, it might be the same.  And then Petro is another $700 again.  How does this work?  Then there's Midland Funding for just under $1,000.  Then there's New Century Financial Services for $5,400.  And then another for Midland for just under $1,000.  What are you doing?  Are you, like, opening up accounts and fucking around a little bit?  No, listen to me. 
[01:06:00]  Those accounts were open when I was working, okay?  When I was working.  And then when I became homeless, there was nothing I could do about it.  I mean, it's so hard to explain.  You just didn't pay your bills.  When I lost my job, when I lost my job, I had no source of income whatsoever.  Lady Di, are you also known as Diana Schmitz?  That was my...  You have to tell everybody my married name.  What does it matter?  That was when I was married. 
[01:06:30]  That was my name.  So basically, when...  What are you telling everybody this for?  Basically, when you lost your job, you couldn't pay your bills.  That's all this is.  Right.  You lost your job, you couldn't pay your bills.  But it looks like you're opening up all sorts of accounts, though.  I think you were doing some fooling around here.  You open up a new bank account, you get a little credit card.  Yeah, you use that credit card.  And then you move on to the next bank. 
[01:07:00]  There's too many banks involved here.  I'm trying to explain something to you.  I already had those credit cards.  I had them already.  From four different banks?  One, two...  I had those credit cards already.  Well, that's some personal thing here.  I don't know what that is.  I'm not going to say that.  Why'd you have so many credit cards?  Yeah.  You know what?  I don't know.  I just...  I had a lot of credit cards back then.  I don't know.  And you maxed them all out.  Well, what do you...  You know, I mean...  Like I said, I lost my job. 
[01:07:30]  And what was I going to do?  You know, I had to live on something.  Oh, no.  But I thought I took care of all that already.  Oh, yeah.  How?  It's like...  Well, you paid off tens of thousands of dollars?  So it looks like the max was $10,000 per credit card.  $10,000 per card.  And she paid back maybe like the first payment.  And that was it.  I can't...  Oh, man.  I don't want to talk about it anymore.  I can't pay these people.  I really wish I could, but I can't. 
[01:08:00]  Lady Di, is there one aspect of your life...  Lady Di, Lady Di.  Is there one aspect of your life...  That you feel you kind of have...  You got right?  Well, first of all, when Bill took me in...  You know, then...  That isn't you.  That's Bill.  Huh?  There's not one thing you're doing in your life...  That you could look at and go,  Well, at least I'm doing this right.  Nothing.  Well, yeah, there kind of is. 
[01:08:30]  You know, I mean...  I mean, I got a job after Bill took me in...  And that was for a temporary agency.  You know, a temp agency.  Years ago.  And I was working...  I worked there for around two or three years.  How come when we talk about things like liens and judgments,  you go, Oh, that was old.  That was years ago.  But when we talk about jobs, you're like, Oh, I had a job.  That was years ago.  How funny is it that it's lean?  A lean.  Lean.  Yeah.  Nothing lean about you.  Yes, exactly.  I mean, I just... 
[01:09:00]  Hold on.  Hold on a minute.  Let me just say hi to Ryan.  Ryan!  Yeah.  Hey.  Hello.  Can you just please hang up on Lady Di for us, please?  The listeners everywhere I want to get this over with.  All you got to do is ask.  That's fine.  All you got to do is ask.  That's it.  All you got to do is ask.  Bye-bye.  It's exhausting.  It is fucking exhausting.  We were going to move on today from the whole Lady Di thing,  and then it turns out she gets mugged.  I was thinking of, like, the Lady Di from N.E.W. days. 
[01:09:30]  Right.  And what a mess we thought she was then.  Right.  She was a fucking upstanding citizen.  Oh, big time.  Back then compared to now.  And then she did get a lot of money from her dad.  Yep.  And she obviously didn't use it to try to, you know, pay back some of that stuff.  Just a waste.  We give her a week of, like, kind of showing her what it's like to, you know,  get a schedule, wake up.  Right.  Do something.  Earn some money.  Right.  And then she just fucking blows it on beer, driving drunk, 
[01:10:00]  walking around with her fucking head in the clouds in a horrid neighborhood.  Just doing everything wrong.  Everything wrong.  You could possibly do it one day.  Everything wrong.  Have too many beers at home.  Then start driving around.  Then go to a horrible neighborhood, to a chicken place.  The chicken place is flashing some hundies around.  With nothing but cold hard cash on you.  Like, what the fuck? 
[01:10:30]  Oh, just sitting there so the guy is sizing her up the whole time.  Oh, my God.  I don't think you could do anything more wrong in one day.  Just fucked up.  All right.  Jesus.  There's your update.  There you go, people.  There's your update.  Lady Di got mugged.  All right.  And I said it.  I said there's no way she'll have the money by Monday.  And regardless of the circumstance.  Yeah, but she did this herself.  Yes.  She could have prevented all this. 
[01:11:00]  Of course.  I love chicken, too.  But, man, I'm not going to Crown Chicken.  No.  9.30 at night on a Saturday.  In the middle of the ghetto.  9.30 means, you know, sun's down.  Right.  No way.  Do you know how good, though, Crown Chicken must taste?  It's amazing.  It's fucking...  Those places in the hood that have chicken that everyone...  I don't know what the hygiene is there.  It might be great.  It might not be.  They probably laugh at KFC.  Oh, it's probably so good.  They probably laugh.  Like, you have no idea how good chicken could actually be. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  And I do love KFC, but Crown's got to be so much better.  I haven't eaten KFC in years, but I want to.  That was my hangover food when I was in Buffalo.  Yeah.  Go on a KFC run.  Get a bucket.  KFC is pretty good.  Mashed potatoes.  It is, right?  It's pretty fucking tasty.  Oh, it's ridiculous how good it is.  It's just loaded with salt and grease.  It's wonderful.  Wasn't making a lot of money, but spent the extra on all white meat.  Oh, yeah.  Gotta go all white.  It's probably not good for you.  I mean, you should need it more than, like, every other day. 
[01:12:00]  I'll have it, like, every other day.  I'm sure.  But I won't go every other day.  Not every day.  No.  No, be irresponsible.  Oh, boy.  All right, then.  We're going to take a break here.  All right, Dan.  We certainly will move on to other things.  Don't you worry.  Please.  Is this, uh... 
[01:12:30]  Hearing terrible news.  Yeah.  Just terrible.  Is it true?  They're saying it's not a joke.  Odorous, who's done our show a couple times at least.  He's done Red Eye.  Yeah.  He knows a lot of the same people we do.  They're saying he's dead.  Yeah, 50 years old.  You kidding?  Found him dead in his home at the age of 50.  How did it happen? 
[01:13:00]  I don't know if they know yet.  Dave Brockie, right?  Was his real name?  Odorous?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And what?  The band's making a statement?  Or is somebody making a statement at 1 o'clock today?  I think so, yeah.  They're saying that he, um...  They're saying that, like, yeah, we wish it was a joke.  You know, if you feel like, well, is it a joke?  Because, you know, the kid that...  He's such a weird guy.  Yeah.  They're saying, no, it's the truth.  Seemed dumb.  Damn.  Pretty healthy.  Yeah, I don't know if he did drugs or not.  I'm guessing just being in that band, you party.  But I don't really... 
[01:13:30]  I didn't know him well enough off the air to know if he did that.  We just knew him on air, and he was definitely a very cool guy.  He was funny, and he was good on Red Eye, too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was really...  He was a smart guy.  He always had an interesting angle.  It was just hard to take him serious sometimes in this, you know, dress like a space monster.  That wacky get-up.  Right.  So I guess we'll know more at 1 o'clock today.  What are they saying online so far?  Nothing, really, right?  Yeah, just that he was found.  Yeah, I read that article.  I didn't see anything in there. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, they don't know.  They haven't announced anything as to.  Fuck it.  Damn.  If anyone knows anything more, please let us know.  Yeah, it's a shame.  That's two guys that have done our show in the last week that have died.  Odorous and the big bald guy.  Remember the guy with the huge balls?  Oh, yeah, man.  Wesley something his name was.  Yeah.  That documentary is fucking...  I mean, fascinating.  Oh, God.  With his hoodie wrapped around his nuts. 
[01:14:30]  And he's pretty smart.  Let's figure that out.  What are you going to do, right?  It's really smart.  Want to leave the house and got, you know, a big ball sack.  What do you do?  He's sick as though he's eating off of them.  Like he puts a fucking little tablecloth on his ball bag and just puts his plate on there  and starts eating off his nuts.  It's so fucked off.  I just imagine if you poked in the pain.  He must have felt it.  Just a little poke.  Yeah.  Doink.  And it looks like they've found the plane, I think. 
[01:15:00]  I don't know.  Australia and China spot objects in ocean.  That means nothing, though, at this point.  No, they're pretty confident about this one, finally.  And they're not losing sight of this debris.  And supposedly a ship's pretty close at this point.  It made me sad.  They were talking to one of the family members.  And they were saying, of course, they're going to hold on to hope.  It's just what you do.  Right.  And they're like, yeah, we keep thinking that we're going to see like a plane wing  with like people clinging to it. 
[01:15:30]  Oh.  Of course not.  It's been two weeks in the ocean without water.  You're dead after a few days.  You know, it's just the sad part of just what family members hold on to, you know.  And then you wonder if anyone, you know, did survive the actual, you know, crash for a day or two.  You'll never know, right?  Oh, they will.  Once they get that black box, they'll know.  If they said it plummeted, you'll know nobody survived.  Yeah.  And then they adjusted another fact in this whole thing.  Hmm.  That there wasn't, there was no funny business after they, oh, shoot. 
[01:16:00]  What was it exactly?  You mean the Canada said goodnight?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They had that wrong the entire time.  Yeah, they don't know what the fuck they're talking about.  Basically, there was no funny business after they said goodnight or whatever the hell it was.  What's the exact fact?  I've got to find it out.  But, uh, yeah.  The two objects.  I mean, you can't blame people for coming up with weird theories, though.  It's because it's just such a rarity that a plane disappears. 
[01:16:30]  And there was a couple of things that didn't line up right.  Right.  The communication, the turn.  You know, it just, it was a lot of things that just didn't make sense.  And all of a sudden, the plane is gone.  Yeah.  It's like there was just some catastrophic event on the plane is what it's starting to look like now.  Maybe someone, maybe someone rolled the window down inadvertently.  No, that, you can't, hold on, hold on.  You can't do that.  There's no, there's no window rolled down.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  All the way, all the way up to 45,000 feet, then all the way down to, is that 23 or 33? 
[01:17:00]  Then 43,001.  Right.  I was the pilot, I wonder if the, say, let's say the communications got fucked up by a fire or whatever.  Why would the pilot go up there?  And this will sound very naive, but is it harder for a fire to burn at that height because of the less oxygen?  I wonder.  I don't know.  Like, was that some kind of last, like, last thing he was trying to do to maybe tame a fire or something?  Wow.  That would be a hell of a move. 
[01:17:30]  Interesting concept.  That's what I thought of, is just why else would you go to that height consciously and not communicate with the tower?  We could book you on CNN because they haven't said that one.  That's true.  And then they could go in their flight simulator and try it out.  Try it out in the simulator.  Oh, God, I hate that guy.  Well, today we're going to try out.  You know, it's so realistic up here.  You feel like looking out the window and looking for debris.  Yeah.  Do you?  Oh, God.  Have you seen the flight simulator guy yet?  Oh, he's all over. 
[01:18:00]  But I was reading in the paper that this has been great for CNN.  Their ratings have gone up ridiculously.  Although they're not.  But that's why they've stayed on it as long as they have, because the other two channels, not so much.  I miss NBC and Fox.  They may move to other stories throughout the day.  Oh, wow.  That's weird.  CNN not as much.  What?  On Fox, picture of Iranians with two faces, same legs.  They put two different bodies on the same legs.  What is that about?  I don't know.  Let's see. 
[01:18:30]  Because the legs are not his.  Well, why did it take almost two weeks for anybody to notice?  Hey, wait a minute.  They've got the same legs.  Because we look at their faces, dummy.  They're just chopped at the bottom.  You have a wonder, too.  Not even close.  You very rarely see surveillance video that has been photoshopped.  But this was unintentionally photoshopped.  They claim of the two passengers who had one man by them, both stolen packages.  Wait.  We should have.  So it's a little suspicious regarding that.  But the Malaysians say, oh, we didn't mean to make a mistake.  But we're sorry. 
[01:19:00]  All right.  Wait.  How would they make that mistake?  But it's so obvious.  Why didn't anyone figure that one out?  It was so obvious.  With all these experts and all eyes on this story, why did it take almost three weeks  to go, wait, those two guys with the fake passports have the exact same legs?  Oh, no.  And it wasn't even done well.  No.  What's the purpose of that?  Because it's putting one guy on the, you know.  But it's the same picture we've all seen where it's side by side.  And it's so obvious they have the exact same legs.  I guess because you're looking at the faces.  No one looks at the legs. 
[01:19:30]  Well, you don't think that the legs will be different.  You're looking for faces.  But what are they saying about that?  The Malaysians are saying it was a mistake.  But how did that happen?  Yeah.  Why wouldn't you just add the pictures?  Why not just the pictures?  So now we've got to find that out.  Yeah.  But this is the kind of weird shit that makes conspiracy theories.  Like, you know, I don't like conspiracy theories that hold on to something once the facts have  been proven.  Yeah.  But this is kind of hard to let go of.  It's...  Yeah.  They're going to run with that.  They'll run with that big time.  Big time.  Yeah.  So. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, boy.  Ridiculous.  We've got a lot of guests coming in today.  By the way, I hope, before we move on, I hope that the fucking someone here at Sirius  puts out the fact that I gave that theory first.  That the pilot went to that light.  Right.  Because the fire wouldn't burn as well.  Try to put out a fire?  I like that.  I like that theory a lot.  Someone else will get credit for it, though.  Yeah, of course.  No one in this...  No one pushes our stories forward.  No.  Whatsoever.  I don't know if that would work.  Probably not.  I'm trying to think. 
[01:20:30]  Mike, why would you live somewhere where a mudslide could take you out?  Mm-hmm.  Eight people dead in massive mudslide.  Where was this?  It's Washington State.  Vegas.  All right, Washington State.  Did you see the remains after the mud did its thing?  Oh, my God.  It's like half a mountain or something.  Yeah, that was a lot of fucking real estate.  Things just get all loosey-goosey, and then they have to go, right?  And they got to just go somewhere.  Wow.  Yeah, that's fucked up.  Like, eight people dead. 
[01:21:00]  They're missing a bunch more.  Yeah, that's some scary shit.  Every day there's plenty of tragedy.  Tragedy.  A lot of...  To enjoy as you turn on your TV.  Just put on the news and bask in the tragedy.  Enjoy.  Every day there's sorrow.  Loss of life.  It's great, right?  I love it.  What else was going on today?  That character actor died, too.  If you saw his face, you would know.  Yeah, he was on Home Land. 
[01:21:30]  He was on Home Land.  It was his big role.  I think he was in Meet the Parents, too.  He was in Scent of a Woman, I think.  He was like the guy...  He looked the same for 30 years.  He played...  Yeah, he was in A Million Thing.  You know his face.  What's his name?  That's the problem.  His name's James Rebhorn.  James Rebhorn.  I wouldn't know him as James Rebhorn.  I know.  But you see the face and go, oh, that guy!  When I read the name, I'm like, who was it?  Right.  I have no idea.  Well. 
[01:22:00]  Hey, Godspeed.  Godspeed, Tigger.  They're not going to find this rocket plane.  No, they won't.  They won't.  No, this debris.  I bet this debris is just more sheer.  They're very confident because it's round and rectangle.  Yeah, and it says Malaysia AI on it, but they're not sure what the last letter is.  Imagine.  Somebody on Fox used Jimmy's theory about the oxygen last week.  Oh, did they really?  When you're that high, fire does go out, but they have something to keep it going, but 
[01:22:30]  it will kill the passengers.  What?  What?  No one on Fox used that.  That's mine.  It's Jimmy's.  Make sure everyone knows that's Jimmy's theory.  Chris in Queens.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hi, Chris.  Jimmy's theory actually is not that bad.  It would displace fire, but there's no fire-suppressing bottles in the actual avionics bay.  So if the fire was in the avionics bay, it would have knocked out the transponders and the communication.  But another thing is, is when he climbs the 43,000 feet and dips back down, that creates  a lot of G-force.  So if he took the plane, that's a good way to kill the passengers by going all the way 
[01:23:00]  up really fast and then dropping really fast.  It's like going on a roller coaster, but it would have knocked the passengers out.  The swerving side to side would also have killed them as well.  So if he was taking the plane to kill himself and to anguish his family, he would have knocked  the passengers out humanely, then just pointed it towards the Indian Ocean and killed  himself while the plane goes to a zombie plane.  Okay.  Whatever.  Yeah.  That's your theory.  That's where you're going with, huh?  But the fire could have knocked out communications in the transponders.  Yeah, it could have in the avionics bay. 
[01:23:30]  And what it turns to a zombie plane is that smoke displaces oxygen.  And the pilots usually have a quick dining van in the cockpit, and they usually have four  to five seconds before all that smoke displaces the oxygen.  So they could have been knocked out.  The avionics bay could have been burnt out, and the plane pretty much does what it wants  at that point.  Yeah, I just don't like the term zombie plane.  No, that's kind of silly.  It sounds cool.  Yeah, I know.  It's a good idea of a term, but it basically turns itself into nothing.  That's a silly way to put it.  Yeah, it's cool.  All right.  All right, fellas.  Thank you. 
[01:24:00]  I'm going to watch this dumb plane make that turn one of the goddamn times.  It's not the same thing.  Right.  With the turn.  Plus, the way they make it turn is not good.  They can all stick.  No, it's just going...  Yeah, planes don't turn like that.  Turning, turning, spinning on my axis.  Right.  That's just a horrible story continues, so...  Yeah, I thought it would be done by now, that's for sure.  Mm-hmm.  Good luck to you.  Well, you know...  Keep up your good nature.  Everyone's saying that it was already... 
[01:24:30]  That theory was already put out there.  Oh, jeez.  I didn't...  But I didn't see it.  I swear...  To...  Mm-hmm.  No, just in general.  Just swearing?  Just swearing in general.  Yes.  I think...  Here's what my theory is.  The pilot's hat got blown out the window, and the wind stream took it up, and he was flying  to get his hat back.  To get his hat.  In a moment of panic, he wanted his hat.  It was just out of reach.  Yeah.  Because the wind was taking it out.  It was a windy day.  He'd get in trouble for that.  Yes.  When it was landed, if you have no hat, the other pilots laugh at you. 
[01:25:00]  They're like, oh, you were hatted.  He didn't want that.  Yes.  Being hatted in the air is a humiliation for pilots.  Well, Jimmy Carter writes letters.  Is that what he does?  He wants everyone to know he writes letters.  Oh, because he's afraid of...  NSA.  NSA.  Why is he afraid of anything at his age?  Well, that's probably why he writes letters.  Afraid of the big one, but...  But what's he...  But everything else, who cares?  What's in that letter that's so important?  The NSA has argued that this kind of intelligence gathering is critical to try to protect the 
[01:25:30]  American homeland?  That has been extremely liberalized and, I think, abused by our own intelligence agencies.  As a matter of fact, you know, I have felt...  He still sounds...  ...that my own communications were probably monitored.  And when I want to communicate with a foreign leader privately, I type or write the letter  myself, put it in the post office, and mail it.  Old-fashioned snail mail.  Yeah, because I believe if I send an email, it will be monitored. 
[01:26:00]  I just wanted to ask, finally, with all your energy, what keeps you going?  How old is he now?  He's 80-something.  I'm trying to look it up, because I can't believe we're still talking about Jimmy Carter.  An old codger.  Types out the...  He's got to be late 80s.  Easy.  85.  89.  There you go.  Almost 90-fucking-year-old.  And he sounds great.  He sounds all right, man.  Is he still hammering away?  Yeah.  Does he still hammer, or does he kind of supervise at this point?  Well, he hammers when the cameras are out, for sure. 
[01:26:30]  Does he hammer in the morning?  All over this land, eh?  Thank you.  I like Jimmy Carter, man.  You like Jimmy Carter?  I don't like his politics, necessarily, but I like him, though.  I like him, though.  I like him.  You can tell he's a good guy, a good human being.  He's genuine.  Means well.  He's one of those means well guys.  When you live long enough like that, you know, people kind of forget what an awful  president he was, and they're like, ah, he's just an old humanitarian kind of guy.  Was he that bad, though, or was...  I mean, it didn't help that the economy sucked around that time, too. 
[01:27:00]  He was pretty goddamn bad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Also...  He was another one.  Cutting the military, and lost a lot of jobs.  Yeah, the economy sucked, but...  He also got blamed, too, because he gave the Shah of Iran sanction.  A sanctuary, yeah.  Yeah, and then the Ayatollah, and all they hated the U.S.  That's why they hated the U.S. so much, because he was keeping the Shah, and they wanted the  Shah.  Yeah.  He got blamed for that botched fucking rescue operation.  Right.  Mm-hmm.  Wasn't the Reagan... 
[01:27:30]  The day Reagan in an office, they released those?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which was just such a fuck you to Jimmy Carter.  It was a fuck you directly to him, yeah.  Yeah.  That was Jimmy Carter's thing.  But he didn't get the credit for it.  Let me say hi to Scott on Long Island.  We have to take this call.  Scott.  Yeah, what's going on, boys?  That guy talking about diving the aircraft to create G-forces and not getting the passengers  is an idiot.  I was going to call him out on it, but I figured out who gives a shit.  If you're doing stuff on a passenger plane like that, that would knock the passengers out 
[01:28:00]  just because of G-forces, the plane would come apart.  Well, there's that, but the fact is, if you dive an aircraft, you create negative G-forces,  so they'd be floating around all happy like astronauts.  That's going to create G-forces, you have to turn the aircraft, and those aircraft cannot  withstand that kind of G-forces without coming apart.  Okay.  So, yeah, and plus you would just drop the cabin pressure if you wanted to knock them  out, right?  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  That's what I've done when I wanted to knock the passengers out.  Oh, sure.  Sometimes, yeah, I have a pilot's license.  I don't talk about it, but I'll zip around with a couple hundred people.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a big joke I play. 
[01:28:30]  They think they're going to Hawaii, and I drop them back off, and I say, close the windows.  Big surprise.  And then six hours later, I drop them at LaGuardia.  Close the windows.  All right, boys, function out.  Thank you, Scott.  Okay.  Yeah, it seemed a little far-fetched, that whole thing.  Yeah, I knew that, but I didn't want to call them embarrassing.  I know.  Like when the caller is an asshole.  We didn't play the Louis C.K. thing on Friday, but I think it's a visual.  But it's so fucking funny, man.  Well, the end of it's a visual.  But the end is hilarious when he walks in. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  At the talking point.  Right.  Oh, look at that.  Isn't that interesting?  Do you have the end on this?  No.  Where it goes to the thing?  No.  Because it's just him laughing.  Yeah.  Yeah, but that brings the whole thing together.  I know, but you've got to see him doing it, because then he does the Louis impression from the movie.  You know, it's the clip from the movie.  Right.  This is more of a, oh, shit.  He was on that show.  Right.  That is what it is, because Louis is saying that that never happens. 
[01:29:30]  Louis is like, fuck that.  And then the guy is like, no, that guy was.  And then you're like, oh, shit.  Right.  All right.  So.  I have no idea what you're talking about.  Well, we didn't want to give it away in case people haven't seen it yet.  I have not.  All right.  Well, so why don't we just play the first part of this right here?  Yeah.  Louis was on Stephen Merchant's podcast.  Yeah.  Recently?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We were talking about the Actors Studio.  Right.  You know Inside the Actors Studio?  You ever seen that program?  Sure, yeah.  And you know at the end they have a series of questions that they do?  It always occurs to me.  You know when they ever, when an actor stands up during the, one of the people in the audience, 
[01:30:00]  he says, I'm an actor, and what can I do?  And asks Sean Penn or whoever, what can I do to reach your level or whatever?  And you just want to say, that's it.  You never will be famous.  You will never be famous.  There's no way you ask Sean Penn a question and then you're going to be huge.  There's not a single member of that audience that would stand up and cry while talking to  him.  Oh, and then that was, that became Juliette Lewis or somebody.  No.  Hilarious concept, but why did he pick Sean Penn? 
[01:30:30]  That is weird.  It worked out perfectly.  It worked out it was Sean Penn that was on stage.  Why did he?  I think it's just for weirdness.  I don't know.  It's just one of those things.  So he, he never saw, I don't think, cause this wasn't like a well-known clip.  So he just, he pulled Sean Penn out of thin air to make his point, but Sean Penn, well,  I think it was just because Sean Penn is like, when you think of actors who take themselves  too seriously.  Right.  Sean Penn's kind of the first name. 
[01:31:00]  Next time we'll have to ask Louie.  My, my guess is that he pulled Sean Penn, cause Louie is known in the business of being  very gay and he has a thing for Sean Penn.  Yeah, I think he has a thing for Sean Penn.  So here's a, you know, a clip from inside the active studio when Sean Penn, I went to  the audience for our questions.  Right.  Just like Louie just talked about.  Hey, Mr. Penn.  My name is Bradley Cooper.  I'm a second year actor.  My question regarding Hurley Burley, what was it like to revisit a character Eddie after  a 10 year hiatus? 
[01:31:30]  Did you have new discoveries?  Did you find that it was a different approach because you had already done this character  before?  Yeah, it was a, it was the first time that I'd done a film of something that I had done  in the play.  That's pretty much it.  But I mean.  That is so weird that Louie would pick Sean Penn.  Louie's just saying.  And how someone would just stand up and ask a question.  That person would never be famous.  But that actually happened with Bradley Cooper asking Sean Penn a question.  Yeah.  Before Bradley Cooper was anybody.  He's famous.  Right.  Yes.  But then.  And then he does the movie with. 
[01:32:00]  Then he does American Hustle.  And they have scenes together.  And someone put the scene at the end of this clip just to bring it all together.  But I think it's hilarious.  Yeah.  Just go, go back to the question part.  Bradley Cooper.  It was a different approach because you had already done this character before?  Yeah.  It was a, it was the first time that I'd done a film of something that I had done a play  of.  And so because I think Marlon Brando once said, you know, the movie. 
[01:32:30]  Fades out because he answers a question.  Then they go to a scene from America.  Bradley Cooper walks in laughing his ass off.  Making fun of Louie.  Making fun of Louie.  That's funny.  He's humping him.  That was a funny scene in the movie.  Spanking Louie.  Louie walks out embarrassed.  Bradley still loses his mind laughing his ass off.  That's Louie impression.  That's hilarious. 
[01:33:00]  That is quite a coincidence.  Quite the coinkydink.  I'm glad people think that sexual assault man-on-man is funny.  I don't find that funny.  No?  No, I think it's a very serious problem.  Hilarious.  It should have been a bare bottom spanking.  I think it's probably just a random pull.  That was a random pull on Louie's part.  And it actually happens with Sean Penn.  And then they're in American Hustle together.  And that scene is great because, you know, they're just making fun of Louie C.  And the Stephen Merchant podcast was from 2008. 
[01:33:30]  So it wasn't even.  Damn.  It's not recent at all.  No.  Somebody just found.  Wow.  And put all this together for everybody.  We'll put the clip up on our Facebook page.  Oh, and a show.  And Twitter.  Well, Louie had a secretary named Kennedy.  And then Kennedy had a secretary named Lincoln.  Oh, Lincoln.  Wow.  It's the Louie Bradley Cooper coincidences.  Well, those real.  Those coincidences.  I think a few of them.  I guess if you look into anything long enough, you'll find some weird shit, maybe.  The secretary is true.  That's a little strange.  Lincoln's secretary was Kennedy and vice versa. 
[01:34:00]  Wasn't there an inauguration?  But that could just be that's when the people are inaugurated.  But if you look them up, look at the Kennedy-Lincoln.  Lincoln, they also said that Lincoln had a hat and Kennedy should have.  The old warehouse in theater, right?  That's another one, too.  Shot from a warehouse and ran to a theater.  And yeah.  Shot in a theater and found in a warehouse.  Yeah, warehouse.  A warehouse.  A warehouse.  A warehouse.  A warehouse. 
[01:34:30]  Yes.  A warehouse.  A warehouse.  A warehouse.  Who's over here?  Yeah, there are a bunch of those fucking things.  I remember they used to have the back before computers.  You would get those mimeographs.  Oh, boy.  Mimeos at work.  With the joke of the day.  Yes.  The big joke.  That's when you can hang things up in your cubicle.  Why chocolate is better than sex.  Oh, bug.  Why are cucumbers better than a man?  Chocolate won't talk back to you.  Oh.  Jesus.  That's funny.  Cucumber's never tired.  Oh, God.  I like a cuke. 
[01:35:00]  You bet I will.  A good half a cuke.  Yeah, a good half a cuke pounded in there.  You've got to leave, like, the little thing in it that you pick up the corn on the car,  but a cuke will get stuck.  Got to go to the emergency room.  Have a cuke removed.  Pull out.  Yeah, I know.  It's not like me wrong during the...  Where were you when I needed you?  Oh, okay.  I'm in the emergency room.  I should have.  Mr. Hoggish, you've got a half a pickle in there.  I said it's a cuke.  Cucke.  Pickles brain. 
[01:35:30]  Cucke.  I hate that.  Oh, my God.  Nah, do we need to go over this?  Both shot on a Friday.  Both were shot in the head.  Those are the obvious ones.  Both were known by their three names.  The assassins.  But hold on.  They say that's common.  Whenever someone assassinates or commits a crime like that, you become known.  Although David Berkowitz wasn't, but like John Wayne Gacy, a lot of them become known.  That three name thing is... 
[01:36:00]  Isn't that more media driven?  That's it.  Is it?  Yeah.  Because they're now using your proper name, right?  David Chapman.  Yeah.  Right.  Lee Harvey Oswald, yeah.  But then again, you look at Jeffrey Dahmer wasn't, Ted Bundy wasn't.  But maybe they didn't have middle names.  I don't have a middle name.  That's a good point.  Yes, you do.  No, I don't.  Sweetie.  Is that it?  I have a confirmation name.  What's your confirmation name?  Isn't that your middle name?  No, it's the one you choose.  On my birth certificate, I have no middle name.  What's your confirmation name?  Edward. 
[01:36:30]  You took Edward?  I didn't take Edward.  It's my uncle.  You choose to take Edward.  I chose Christopher.  I thought that was a cool name.  Yeah?  Is it?  You wish your name was Christopher?  I did.  I thought that was just really cool.  It looked cool when it was written out because the P came down and the T went up.  There was a whole bunch of shit happening.  A whole bunch of shit happening.  I thought Christopher was a cool looking name.  Yeah?  I liked Christopher Lee.  Yeah.  Oh.  Of course he was in Independence Day.  Thank you.  James Rebhorn.  Let's see.  Hi to Paul in the Bronx.  Paul.  Yes.  Paul.  What's up, guys? 
[01:37:00]  Hey.  Yeah, James Rebhorn is probably best known for Independence Day when the president says,  there is no Area 51.  And the guy goes, that's not entirely true.  Area 51.  Area 51.  It is where we keep the pennies, David.  All right.  We got it.  You're Jewish.  We know.  It's so Jewish.  You don't have to do that.  Thank you.  Yeah.  He was in everything that guy.  Yes.  He was the dad in blank check.  Oof.  All right. 
[01:37:30]  All right.  Go with the obvious.  We got to take a break because we're going to go guest heavy now.  Dominic Monaghan is in next.  Yeah.  And then we got Hulk Hogan today.  The Hulk.  Yes.  Yeah.  Well, I wonder how excited our own E-Rock is.  Well, we have to take a break after Hulk so E-Rock can clean the semen out of his underpants.  And then Bobby Moynihan.  Finally makes an appearance.  Yeah.  The drunken uncle himself.  We don't have a problem with him, do we?  No.  He loves the show.  He is a fan.  But got bummed when he looked at, when he, what? 
[01:38:00]  He looked, he listened to the YouTube clip of you guys.  But he got excited because he saw Opie and Anthony, who supposedly he's a big fan of.  He got excited.  I'll tell you this.  A lot of times we hear that shit and then we call the person out on it and you realize  they just said that.  They don't really listen.  He specifically said, no, I looked up the clip on YouTube and said, well, wow, ONA are  talking.  He knows who you guys are.  He knows Ron and Feds.  And he was all excited that we were talking about him.  Yeah.  And then it was us just beating the shit out of his appearance.  Well, I don't know.  Which he already knew was not good. 
[01:38:30]  But he didn't need, you know, his radio heroes.  That's true.  What was that again?  Drunken Uncle at the 12-12-12 concert.  Right, right, right.  Hurricane Sandy.  It was Hurricane Sandy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  My manager does that.  He goes, J.G.M., they're big fans.  They're big fans.  And I walk in and they look like a home invasion is happening.  They're not fans, John.  It's a lie nine out of ten times.  I'm telling you.  I'll believe it when I see it for myself.  Things are changing.  Bobby Moynihan is a legit fan.  I've spoken to him. 
[01:39:00]  Maria Menounos, legit fan.  Yeah.  More of my husband.  Pat Knoxwall, legit fan.  Pat, we know, because he tells us that he drives around L.A. in the afternoons listening  to us.  So let's stop being negative names.  What's up, Pat?  Sure, we've got three people.  And now it's just in the last week.  Three people after 20 years.  That's wonderful.  That's a great track record.  Yeah.  You.  We had Sylvia Miles.  What?  Back in the old day.  Remember that old actress called up and said that she was listening to the show?  And we brought her in? 
[01:39:30]  I don't think we brought her in.  We had her on the phone, though.  What did we do to her?  Well, we didn't know who she was at first.  And so we were mocking her.  But apparently she won an Academy Award and some shit.  She was a Midnight Cowboy.  Yes, yes, she was.  Wasn't that we were trying to find the most famous person listening to our show?  We used to do that bit.  Who's the most famous person listening to our show?  And they would call in.  Devin Rattray.  That's how we met Devin?  That's how we met Devin.  That guy from Goodfellas called.  The guy that said, don't shoot in the driveway.  Oh, right.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:40:00]  When he was pissed away from the guy.  I forgot.  He was a fan.  The don't shoot guy.  Yeah.  We're going to have to redo that bit.  I like that one.  I always liked that one every few years.  But then we have a few others, like a guy who just played the dead body.  Did a reenactment on America's Most Wanted.  Yes, yes, yes.  Yeah, he played a body.  Four years in a row, I had to call in.  Jim Norton, I'm looking at you.  But this lady, yeah, she was a fan of our show.  Yeah.  Sylvia, why would she be a fan of our show?  She was in Midnight Cowboy.  Didn't she play the real estate agent? 
[01:40:30]  No, wait, that was in fucking Wall Street.  It was in Wall Street.  She was, you were going to ask me for money?  Right, for money, yeah.  And then he's like, no, no, no, you're beautiful.  No, ma'am.  And then he gave her some money.  I'm a stud.  All right, we'll take a break because we're going to get guest heavy.  So stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show will be right back.  Try to expand while the guys are out expanding their bowels.  A lot of guestesses.  A lot of guestesses.  Yes, we do. 
[01:41:00]  Welcome back to the show, Dominic.  Hey, sir, take a seat right there.  Sorry we're a little late today.  Sure.  As they say in certain parts of America.  Yo.  Yo.  Yo.  That's a simple greeting.  What do we know about this Malaysia Airlines thing?  Same thing they knew on day one, I'm pretty much guessing.  They keep spotting mysterious stuff in the oceans, right?  Yeah.  But isn't there always mysterious stuff in the ocean?  I assume stuff is floating around out there all the time.  There's a lot of garbage in our oceans.  A lot of gunk.  A lot of gunk, right?  Supposedly boats drop things. 
[01:41:30]  You know, I never knew that.  It's like, oh, it could be a shipping container.  It's like, how many shipping containers just fall off of boats?  Yeah, is that my car?  Yeah.  It really is amazing.  But, I don't know, supposedly they found more debris.  They're sending boats out to look at that debris.  They're pretty confident about this debris.  How do you know they're confident?  Because they said it's circular.  I don't know what that means, though.  Yeah, I mean.  They said because it's circular, they're pretty confident that. 
[01:42:00]  Right, right.  Cylinders.  Yes.  Cylinder.  Maybe.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Are you a conspiracy guy?  Do you think it was a, or are you?  Yeah, although I resent the word conspiracy, because it always gives you, it doesn't allow  you to actually give it any power as soon as you're like, oh, it's a conspiracy.  It undermines what you think.  Okay, because you think.  But, yes, I, you know, I do believe in some famous conspiracies.  Which ones?  Yeah, what's your favorite?  Not favorite, but what's the one that you think is definitely the. 
[01:42:30]  I have a really hard time trying to intellectualize the fact that no structures, no steel buildings  have come down in the history of construction due to fire.  And on 9-11, two of them came down in exactly the same way on the same day.  And building seven is a bit of a mystery to me.  Those, I think, are some pretty extraordinary circumstances, too.  Certainly extraordinary. 
[01:43:00]  Fuel, heat.  You know.  Weakening of metal, things like that.  I think, I think the Kennedy assassination might have a couple of things going on that  we don't know about.  That's always had, you know, an air of conspiracy around it.  Right.  Yeah.  But that's, it's that weird thing, eh?  Conspiracy.  As soon as, if you, if you're labeled a conspiracy theorist, there's something about your brain  that is broken that doesn't work.  What if you just, what if you're just thinking about the alternate idea of what it could be?  I mean, that has relevance.  You're just asking questions.  Yeah.  I think for the most part, people, people that believe in certain conspiracies, it's always 
[01:43:30]  so far off of just the simple explanation that it's like, well, why can't this simple  explanation be what had happened instead of trying to come up with, you know, 20 people  knew, but no one ever spoke.  I've never seen that.  Talk about metal buildings.  I've never seen two people that could keep their mouths shut about an event.  Unless there was a threesome tape with the Kennedys and Marilyn Monroe, which they're speculating. 
[01:44:00]  Whoever shot that is the fucking biggest closed-lipped guy in history.  If there's a porn tape with Jack and RFK.  And that tape went away.  You're not selling it anymore or something.  Yes, maybe it's not real.  Someone's debts were paid.  I don't think so.  Why would they tape themselves to her, film themselves?  Put it to a mirror or something.  Because you're just done it against.  Just having a threesome with your brothers.  With your brother?  I don't want to see my brother's sex case.  Hell no.  That's what I said last week.  Exactly.  I'm interested in that.  Why if something awful happens, like you're having a really great moment and suddenly you lock eyes 
[01:44:30]  with your brother's sex case.  I'm never getting that out of your head.  Or if she takes one of your pricks and hits the other one in the face and says, come on up and turn me on.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, jeez, Jimmy.  Or that.  That too.  I just don't want that to happen.  With Marilyn Monroe, though, you kind of got...  Like, I wouldn't want to see a family.  I don't have any brothers, but I would never want to see my sister.  It's just gross to me.  But if it's someone like Marilyn Monroe, you've got to kind of bite the bullet. 
[01:45:00]  Do you think?  Well, I'd see a lot of watch Marilyn Monroe with no clothes on.  But I don't know.  I'd feel a little conflicted if I had to watch Marilyn Monroe with no clothes on and my brother had no clothes on.  That would kind of, I guess, kill it.  Yeah, just a bit.  A little bit.  Well, JFK was weird because he, like, Mimi Beardsley, that intern who wrote the book, JFK took her virginity,  said that he had her go down on his best friend, Dave Powers, on the White House pool while he just kind of sat there and watched.  Like, he was just like that with his...  It's a dirty boy. 
[01:45:30]  Rock and roll president.  Yeah, he tried to get her to blow Ted and she wouldn't do it.  It's weird that they kill all the good ones, eh?  Yeah.  They kill the Kennedys.  They kill, you know, Marilyn the King.  They kill Lennon.  They kill, you know, all these trailblazers, all these kind of, you know, people that can really affect some change get killed.  Hence the reason.  Yeah.  And, I mean, Lennon was super paranoid about being followed by the FBI and being, you know, having his phone tapped and stuff.  And people just thought that he was paranoid and that the drugs were not working for him anymore. 
[01:46:00]  But it was true.  You know, they had a massive FBI file on Lennon and they were trying to throw him out of the country  because he could rile up a large group of people.  He could essentially cause a revolution and they do not want that.  Yeah.  Anytime a person can get that much power, people figure, eh, we've got to get rid of this guy.  Yeah.  It's a bit scary.  It is.  Do you ever hear that last Rolling Stone interview?  There's all you have at 2 that Lennon did.  We played that, right? 
[01:46:30]  Oh, yeah, we have.  He was just talking about getting older and he's 40 and he's like, yeah, it was kind of saying like he was wrong about certain things  and a lot of it was his own fault just being like, he was just turning into like a regular middle-aged guy.  Yeah.  He was kind of mellowing out like people do.  Losing some of his anger, yeah.  Yeah, when they get to 40 and they've got like, you know.  Yeah, that angst goes away because, yeah, you have a great life.  You look around and realize, oh, there's some people living like crap and I'm doing pretty well.  He's a multimillionaire with a little baby and he's making bread in the Dakota, not the Dakota.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that was the place, yeah. 
[01:47:00]  I mean, I think Lennon's probably my ultimate hero outside of, you know, people in my life that I actually know.  I mean, if I'm struggling, you know, through anything in my life, I tend to read stuff about Lennon or listen to Lennon.  And, you know, my favorite thing ultimately about Lennon is like he took his pain and turned it into art,  which I think is a pretty admirable thing.  And he always speaks from truth, even if it hurts him, even if it's painful, even if it puts his life in danger.  He will answer a very frank question truthfully.  And I admire that, you know, I think it's a great way to be. 
[01:47:30]  It's so easy to lie and be like, no, I don't feel that way.  But he's like, I do feel that way.  And if I'm, you know, I mean, ultimately he died for that stuff.  Yeah, well, Ringo was just as deep, I think.  Hey, Octopus's Garden, come on.  Was that Ringo?  That was Ringo.  Oh, boy, was it ever.  I do like, he sang a song in the early Beatles period called Boys, which is kind of good.  Yeah, he redid that recently on that special they did.  Yeah, kind of rock and roll.  That's the one I was telling you guys about.  It was a cool song. 
[01:48:00]  I never heard that one before.  Yeah, that one was kind of cool.  I mean, he did some absolute stinkers.  Yeah.  Yellow Submarine, let's go.  Yeah, Yellow Submarine's classy.  There's a song on the White Album just before Why Don't We Do It In The Road.  What was that song?  It's a Ringo song.  You were in a car crash and you cut your hair.  Yeah, like, what line is that?  What does that even mean?  Oh, what is that?  Probably some weird Beatles drug reference.  Of course.  You know, like, they did all this veiled drug shit.  What the hell are you talking about?  You were in a car crash and you lost your hair. 
[01:48:30]  I wonder where you are sometimes.  Oh, don't pass me by.  It's a terrible song.  Horrible.  It ruins the White Album.  I mean, the White Album is such an epic album.  It's a double album by the Beatles.  So if you're going to pick a Beatles album, you may as well get a double for your mind.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a great, you know, study of a band just fracturing apart.  Yes.  Pretending to be a band.  You don't want to be the guy that ruins the White Album.  Right.  Lennon's in his studio doing his thing.  McCartney's in his studio doing his thing.  All those songs. 
[01:49:00]  And look, one Ringo song.  And then they gave him, and then Good Night.  Good Night, which is quite nice.  That's a Lennon song that they gave to Ringo.  But, I mean, you got...  What do you mean?  Well, Lennon wrote Good Night.  Why does, oh, why does it say Star?  Just for the vocals.  Oh, for vocals.  I see what they did.  Okay, so he only sings two songs for the whole thing.  It was written by Lennon.  Gotcha, okay.  Don't Pass Me By and Good Night are the only songs that...  I mean, You're Blues by Lennon on that album, amazing.  Why Don't We Do It in the Road, which is one of McCartney's rockiest moments. 
[01:49:30]  Hell, a skelter, for Christ's sake.  I mean, that is just epic.  Happiness is a warm gun.  Amazing.  Yeah.  Do you think that...  I wonder if that...  I don't know the song you mean about Ringo.  Is that you were in an accident and you lost your hair, a Jane Mansfield reference?  Maybe.  Oh, Jesus.  I mean, back at that time, that was like, what, in the late 60s, and she had probably died  not too long before that.  Lost a little more than her hair.  Well, yeah, but that might have been too harsh to say.  You lost your head, so maybe that was like a poetic way.  Right.  I'm saying you...  It probably had nothing to do with anything. 
[01:50:00]  Probably not.  No.  I'm just throwing in a fucking...  Julia, which ends the A-side.  It's the last song on the A-side.  It's a fucking...  You do know that album.  Yeah, it's amazing.  I mean, it's all about...  I mean, his mom died when he was a kid.  You know, got hit by a police officer, a drunk police officer.  And, I mean, that song...  Again, the thing about taking his pain and turning it into art, you know, sings a song  about his mom, who he misses and who he loves, and he kind of almost has this, like, love affair  with, and I just think there's something about Lennon and that truthfulness and the fact 
[01:50:30]  that he is willing to, like, die by that, that is amazing.  How old was he when she died?  He was 14, and he just rekindled a relationship with her, so she was, like, an absent mom.  He went to live with his auntie for a while, and then when he was 14, he started to rekindle  this relationship with them, just at the point where they started to become connected again.  Wow.  She got killed by an off-duty police officer who was drunk.  She was on a bike and killed her.  So he lost his mom twice, almost, and his dad abandoned him, and, you know, in and out 
[01:51:00]  of, you know, different types of drugs, and then suddenly became king of the world.  Right.  And everyone expected him to be normal.  He's like, oh, I'm not normal.  I've been through some shit.  Yeah, yeah.  Goddamn, yeah.  Weren't the Beatles more the, like, because they said the Rolling Stones had the tough  image, and the Beatles kind of had this goody gumdrops image, but, like, weren't the Beatles  kind of from a tougher area, and the Stones were kind of more the middle-class kids?  Yeah, Stones were London, Beatles were Liverpool.  Liverpool, arguably, is a tougher part of England. 
[01:51:30]  It's just, it's north.  It's rougher.  It's harder to get by there.  It's harder to rise up there, you know?  There's a great line by Lennon in that Jan Wenner-Rolling Stone interview that they recorded,  where he says, you know, if the Rolling Stones are revolutionaries, and people think that  they're revolutionaries, then the Beatles really were revolutionaries.  Like, he's okay with saying the Stones did something, but, like, you know, he says at one  point, like, you know, they're not on the same class level.  Yeah, don't even try to compare the two.  He wrote, uh, the Beatles wrote the first couple of songs for the Stones to get them 
[01:52:00]  up and going.  They did covers of Beatles songs.  And, uh, I think, uh, if they, if they were all, if they were all still around, I think  you couldn't argue the fact that the Rolling Stones were this biggest band in the world,  that kind of thing.  Like, the Beatles changed music, and they did things that no one else has ever done before  or since.  The Beatles are the only band to ever release albums that don't include singles.  So they would release, here's a single, here's a single, here's a single, here's an album. 
[01:52:30]  Whereas nowadays, obviously, people go, here's three singles, and if you want to buy the album,  all those three singles are on the album.  The Beatles were like, no, we're prolific musical artists, so we'll release singles for you.  We'll give you 14 new songs in a month, and then 14 new songs in another couple months,  like, First Backwards Guitars, the Beatles, First Backwards Drums, the Beatles, First Backwards  Vocals is the Beatles, um, five, the top five songs in the United States chart, so like  one, two, three, four, five.  It really is amazing.  And the sheer number of songs that they were able to put out, um, in a short period of 
[01:53:00]  time, too.  Yeah.  The biggest selling artist of the 2000s was Eminem.  The second biggest artist of the 2000s was the Beatles, that shows you just how powerful  they are, you know.  Yeah.  Incredible.  Did you, I found watching that, that amazing Scorsese George Harrison documentary, I hated  Eric Clapton after that.  I was never a big Clapton fan, but, and maybe I'm wrong, because Harrison didn't really seem  to give a shit as much as I did.  No, he didn't seem to mind.  But I could not stand him after that, when he, when I, when he, oh, I fucking hated him. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  What he misses is kind of a, not a good guy, right, so many more girls, you know, like,  I get, I've had friends who've had really cute girlfriends, but there's a respect level  where you're like, okay, that's off limits, you know, it's the guy, it's the guy code,  he broke the guy code.  You got that goddamn Hobbit money, too.  Oh shit.  You got many Hobbit money.  Oh man.  Old friends must hate bringing their girlfriends around you, like the guys that you just knew  from high school.  Like other actors might not care, but back in high school, guys, I was like the littlest 
[01:54:00]  kid in school, you know, I mean, I was not the athlete, I was the kind of class clown and  all that kind of stuff.  Did not get a huge amount of play in school from girls, I mean, they were all after the  football stars.  Right.  There was an interesting irony.  A tough time, yeah.  Coming back to Manchester and being like, oh, you're the girl who didn't have any time  for me and now you want to come hang out.  Did you do it?  Yeah, I did it twice.  Exactly.  Good for you.  I'll show you.  Right.  Sometimes you just have to go back and fucking clean up old business, so to speak. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  Clear the ledger.  Yeah.  There's something still sexy about some of those high school girls that wouldn't sleep  with you.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, it's true.  It's the thing that you can never get.  It's the first time you get super excited about a girl and all that kind of stuff.  I mean, it is exciting times at school.  Someone touches your wiener in recess and you're like, oh, that's fun.  It's phenomenal.  Then eventually when it's a girl, it's even better.  I was 18 the first time, but I actually got psyched. 
[01:55:00]  It was from a girl.  Come on now.  The first time someone touched your ding-a-ling?  Oh, I was five.  No, no, no.  The first time I had intercourse, I was 18.  Oh, okay.  I mean, actual sexual intercourse, I was 18.  Nice.  Wow.  And it was just frightening and not comfortable.  You get these delusions, though, as time goes by about the high school girls and girls  you were attracted to in high school.  They really get put in perspective as you get older and look back and you see them now  and realize like, oh, God, she's just another disaster on fucking drugs and, you know, psychotropic. 
[01:55:30]  You thought she was above all that.  Yeah, yeah.  In high school.  Another lunatic just trying to hold everything together.  Just an angel.  You've got to be careful who you put on a pedestal.  I love that John Cusack movie, Gross Point Blank.  You know, they asked him what was it like coming home and seeing your high school friends  and he said, everyone just kind of swelled.  That's the thing.  Everyone was just like dramatically swollen, like water retention and, you know, the jock is  still being a jock but his knees don't work anymore.  Well, yeah, yeah.  It looks like, especially when you get to look on Facebook now and stuff, you see these 
[01:56:00]  people and they just, and you hadn't seen them in so long, they look like their parents.  Right.  It's like, oh, that's this guy I went to school with.  It's his father.  Yeah.  It's like, no, that's him.  But they're thinking the same things about us.  Of course.  When they see our pictures.  Not delusional.  You think?  No one escapes that shit.  I think I've matured with age.  Right.  Yeah.  Fine whiskey.  I don't know.  I'm thinking right now, you know.  Yeah. 
[01:56:30]  Well, some of the girls, women now, of course, have daughters that look exactly like they  did in high school.  Yeah, that's way.  You don't want to be too creepy.  Yeah.  Well, or not.  Yeah, why not?  I mean, it's kind of vengeance for me.  You should have fucked me because now I've got to take it out on her.  I regret to report.  I regret to report.  I regret to inform you.  I've got a second shot at it.  Yeah.  This is a girl who I used to be in French class with.  And I would look up her.  Like, I was a freshman.  She was a senior.  And I would look across the room at her. 
[01:57:00]  And she would always have, like, a dress on.  I would stare at her legs.  And there was times where I could think she was opening her legs just to tease me.  Damn.  And we were in assembly one time and it was like we were all walking in and out of this  big room.  And I remember I reached between a couple people and I touched her ass.  I had to feel it.  Uh-oh.  And she was like, who did that?  Who did that?  Really?  Yeah.  And I saw her on Facebook recently.  And I'm like, I would still...  Wow.  Like, there's still something.  Like, she's got kids in marriage.  I would still grab her ass and anger her.  Exactly.  I would still grab her ass in a crowd and then cowardly slink away and pick my nose and eat 
[01:57:30]  it.  So I had a whole...  I had to think for her and she's still kind of sexy, man.  So she wasn't trying to show you a little something?  No, I don't know.  Maybe she was, but just to tease the little...  You gotta show us the picture later.  Okay, yeah, I will.  I gotta see.  She looks pretty good now for an older woman.  Yeah.  I mean, I still have a thing for Carrie Fisher.  I think Princess Leia was the first, you know, moment in my life where I was like, ooh,  girls, that's kind of exciting.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You know, Carrie Fisher's not quite the Princess Leia anymore.  No.  No.  She's more like the one that took Han Solo. 
[01:58:00]  Jesus.  But I think I still want to kiss her just so I could say I kissed Princess Leia, you know.  I could get that down.  Yeah.  Well, I think a lot of times we talk about things like that and then go, well, would  you?  And then you go, ah, for the story.  For the story.  Like, I would have to for the story.  Yeah.  But, uh, no.  We gotta talk about the new show before we get out of here.  Oh my God, right, yes.  I'm hearing you're a busy man.  You're still out in the middle of the wild.  Season two, congratulations on that.  Thank you, yeah.  Season two of Wild Things on BBC America, 10 o'clock tomorrow night, Tuesday. 
[01:58:30]  And it's on OLN in Canada as well.  We just kind of like extended our ambition, you know, season two, we were doing a lot  of invertebrates and insects season one because that's kind of my jam in terms of animals.  But this year we did, you know, slightly more dynamic creatures, more dangerous creatures.  The show's bigger and badder and faster.  And, you know, I get messed up a few times.  Really?  The audience will love, I'm sure.  What kind of creatures this season?  We do, first episode is Giant Spitting Cobra. 
[01:59:00]  We do my favorite snake in the world, which is the Gaboon Viper.  Highly venomous.  Why is it your favorite?  It's just so beautiful.  It has the biggest venomous fangs of any snake in the world.  See, that's just creepy.  It's beautiful.  Like there's no, that thing does not care what you have done in the past.  You could be talking about an agent.  Yeah.  No, that thing will own you if it wants to.  But the fact that you can spend some time with it and it can decide not to own you is profound.  It's a nice experience. 
[01:59:30]  I don't know, man.  Have you touched one?  Yeah, I handle one in the show.  We go to Costa Rica to look for one of the rarest frogs in the world.  We go to look for the world's largest beetle.  We go to Thailand to look for the world's largest amphibian.  Wait, how big is the largest beetle?  I need to know.  In what?  Inches?  Yeah, what size?  About eight or nine inches.  Yeah, that's awesome.  It's a big beetle.  Wow.  It's a monster.  You let it crawl on you?  Yeah, we let a bunch of stuff crawl on me in that episode.  See an anaconda. 
[02:00:00]  I saw an anaconda in Brazil that I thought was probably 10-ish feet and it ended up being  about 14 feet, which meant that it could bite me on my calf, which was an interesting  thing.  Massive, big, wild snake and I was trying to wrangle it and I didn't realize just how much  more it was bigger than I thought it was.  Yeah.  And it wheeled around and bit me on my calf, which would make a noise like this.  Oh!  Yeah.  What is the protocol, though, if the snake is choking you?  There's got to be somebody there with a machete just in case the host begins to get squeezed 
[02:00:30]  lifeless.  Well, yeah, we do have a medic who's also a herpetologist that travels with us.  And between he and I, we could probably handle it.  But I mean, if a 14-foot anaconda bit you and got its coils around you, it's probably  a four or five-man job to unhand it.  You know, they have a bunch of teeth and they do not let go.  So, not venomous, luckily, but certainly dangerous.  Yeah, but they could, yeah.  And they kill jaggies.  They can kill jaggies.  Right.  They kill crocodiles.  Cain them.  So, I mean, they could make a real mess of you if they feel like that.  Crush you, yeah.  And do the beetle creep you out when it touched you? 
[02:01:00]  I would hate to have something like a big bug on me.  Bugs suck.  I really do.  I'd rather have a panther crawling on me than a fucking furfly.  I'm okay with insects.  I kind of like them.  They're misunderstood.  You know, they get a bad rap.  But, yeah, we do a bunch of stuff.  We go to New Zealand, go back to New Zealand with one of the guys from Lord of the Rings,  Billy Boyd, and we go looking for the world's largest insect, which is a weta ponga.  Go swim the barrier reef, go swim with sharks in the barrier reef.  What's a weta ponga?  A weta ponga is a type of cave-dwelling cricket.  So, it's a very, very large cricket, and including its antenna, it can be 30 centimeters. 
[02:01:30]  How big is that?  The visual effects company that you are.  What is that?  A foot and a half, maybe?  Yeah.  That's including its antenna.  The body itself is about that big, but the antenna can go to a base.  So, there, you're holding it in your hand.  Wow!  That would just creep me out, even if it didn't bite.  They can bite, but you'll find the largest of their kind are usually very docile.  The largest of any of its kind is usually pretty docile, and the weta pongas just kind  of chill.  I guess when you're that big, you can just kind of be relaxed and nice to everyone. 
[02:02:00]  Come on!  That's absolutely true.  Oh, God!  Yeah, it's a beast.  That is frightening.  They just look like monsters, is what it is.  They are monsters in their world.  They're certainly monsters, you know?  Right.  Oh, man.  And an animal like that can only get big in an isolated place like New Zealand, because  they would get picked off by other animals.  So, you get there, and you give us some information on these things.  We do some weta pongas stuff.  We go back to the Shire, you know?  We meet some old friends. 
[02:02:30]  We hang out and have a lot of fun traveling around.  That's cool.  The show has a ragtag element feel to it.  We want it to feel like the audience are just along for the ride.  There's not a huge amount of planning going on.  Right.  Obviously, for us as a research team, we do do quite a bit of planning to make it seem  that way, but we want it to feel like, for the audience, like, hey, do you want to come  and check this out for a little bit?  It's not super strict stringent.  Right.  Right.  That sounds great, man.  It's fun.  Okay.  Yeah.  They're saying he's got to go.  Really? 
[02:03:00]  A lot of press today.  You're a busy guy, apparently.  Well, that was fun.  It's always nice to see you.  Yeah.  Let's start.  Hold on.  March 25th.  Let's get the plug out.  We'll see you in on BBC America at 10 p.m.  And if you want to Dom's Wild Things on Twitter, in case you forget the plug as you're driving  right now.  Yeah, come follow me on Twitter.  Come send me pictures of you watching wild things or send me pictures of insects or animals  that you can't identify and I'll see if I can help you out.  Or cute pictures of girls.  I don't mind.  I've noticed it's mostly girls talking about how much they love you. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, well, that's good.  I like that.  I mean...  Yeah.  That's a nice one.  It's all chicks.  They're all like, oh my God, I love you.  I'm like, Jesus Christ, this guy.  Enough of this guy.  I'll take it where I can get it.  That's great, right?  Yeah.  It's good to see you guys.  Absolutely, darling.  Thank you.  Continued luck, man.  Are you ready?  Are you ready?

[02:06:30]  you're doing a promo you're doing a promo let me tell you something mean gene  how do you feel to be back in uh you know back in the ring after a lot like you know the wwe  well that's what's so crazy i actually work for another wrestling company  last four years and nobody saw me but but it's really cool to be back home because i mean  if we go way way way way back when it was the wwf right i used to work for vince senior in the late  70s that's how far back i go and then you know there was a little downtime and i went to japan 
[02:07:00]  and minnesota and i went back to work for vince mcmahon and 84 that whole wrestlemania thing took off  he had this vision of it being a global crazy juggernaut company you know man was he right  yeah you figured it out so yeah i guess so so i mean to come back here at wrestlemania 30 after  being at one and actually if you look at my career and and actually be back home and yeah it's kind 
[02:07:30]  of like where i should have ended up anyway and now instead of me saying i'm the immortal hulk hogan  it really happened because he's got a 24-hour network yeah yeah you're gonna watch me forever  yeah you're on there forever now yeah it's crazy we've talked to a lot of the guys over the years and  uh everybody's got their um vince stories and their opinions of vince and everything how have  you gotten along with him over the years from the beginning uh when you uh that's a loaded question  i love it because i mean this is such a goddamn uh personality well we had jim ross in here recently 
[02:08:00]  and he told a good uh uh sharting story where vince shit his pants on live tv and the cameramen were  too scared to actually shoot it but everyone knows it went down that night is that always good  that's all that's not a good one that's a pretty good one i've heard that a million times already  yeah yeah you got a good vince story one that won't get you in too much trouble no i'm good man  um good vince story probably remember when they were doing syndicated tv nappy and all that stuff  and nappy was a big deal and you'd go to vegas and that's when you'd sell all your tvs and stuff 
[02:08:30]  yeah that's kind of dwindled down nappy's not the same remember when we first went there we were  like the odd men out right nobody wanted the wrestlers there you know so all of a sudden vince  and i go to nappy and um we weren't invited to any of the parties or anything so here we go get all  dressed up go down to the first party and some real big guy started on me hey hulk hogan that fake  wrestling stuff and this that and right when i was getting ready to say something here goes vince 
[02:09:00]  over the top of me wow yeah i'm trying to hold him back so i mean you know he was like  you know back in the day he was he was uh very aggressive yeah yeah yeah so i mean you know  vince won't ask you to do anything that he wouldn't do himself yeah well over the years that's become  very apparent especially uh during i guess the 90s was it when he was really in there mixing it up  had the whole family in there and uh attitude era yeah yeah yeah that was a great time though  some crazy crazy times with him man i get along with him great man yeah the deal is it's always 
[02:09:30]  been you know i had to look at it both ways you know there's the business the business vince and  there's the personal vince and on a personal the guy's always been there if anybody defected it was me  you know he was always there and if you needed a shirt off his back he'd give it to you i mean  because that's how cool he was personally business business is business brother i mean  right across the line business wise you know everybody's you know he draws the line and so 
[02:10:00]  there's there's two vince's and some people get that confused like i did you know way way back in  the day you know oh my god you take it personal or whatever but you know now that i step back and  look at it this guy's got this down you know you don't compromise your business yeah and you know so  he's you know he's a great guy but if anybody kind of went south it was me because i didn't  understand you know exactly business from personal and i get it did you want to do more things and  and he was kind of trying to lock you up or no no no no when i worked there i worked there you know 
[02:10:30]  and he was he was really open about doing movies and tv and every stuff everything you know when i  came back his dad was real old school right and real cool god bless his soul but vince was you know  he financed the first movie i ever did no the second movie i did rocky first yeah yeah yeah and then  when i came back vince financed no holds barred and he was on the team for everything i wanted to  ask you that too slide picked you up and threw you over that that or was there some cable no  no ropes no nothing that was him yeah that was i was man his legs were wobbling that's always still 
[02:11:00]  so impressive to watch that scene bro if you don't realize he was like a buck 60 pounds i was like  320 no shit yeah he got me up and he was wobbling he was wobbling his legs are shaking he got it done  though i've had everybody ask me that question over the years it was him he did everything he did all  his own stunts i mean when i power slammed him from corner yeah i landed on him and when i bounced off  him the blood came out of his mouth he goes oh that was great i was like yeah well just the stuff 
[02:11:30]  that was on uh screen yeah was amazing i can only imagine how much more was done that didn't make the  movie that you give me he must have had the shit beat out of him yeah i mean i ran into him at a  comic-con a few months ago and he was just you know when we do the comic-cons it's like live and  hey brother what's up right your family thanks for wearing the colors and i walked in his booth  everything was real quiet he signed autographs and everybody in line was scared to talk and it was 
[02:12:00]  almost like a little creepy you know so i walked in when my guys went hey yo stallone you want to do  this again he looked up at me he was oh no man i don't want to go through that again i remember  i hit him with a high knee in the shoulder in the corner almost broke his collarbone and then i  because i throw my punches straight into the forehead when i throw them you know and i know i caught  him with one really but he was he was a trooper man he yeah the good thing about it is all these  years later that was filmed in 79 i think yeah all these years later he's the same paisan he used to be 
[02:12:30]  hasn't changed a bit was that 83 rocky to a rocky 3 or 82 i think we filmed at 79 or 80 bro oh you  shot way before it was way back then yeah so when you punch you punch in the forehead well i mean i  used to pull him straight out you know i'd kind of pretty good i used to be pretty good judging  trying to pull him out yeah yeah a little perception now you know i used to be pretty good now i would  get be off every once in a while i might end up with a little nick you want to see how good you are  now because jimmy would be willing to no because that's what i've said all ufc guys do stuff and 
[02:13:00]  just but that that's probably what would end me is hulk you know it would be a fucking a fraction of  an inch off and put my nose to my brain so no i won't do that's such a great history with uh with  people and other celebrities and stuff yeah and there's that not you and i just want to do you ever uh  have you seen like richard belzer over the years and and you've had no like communication with  him after that whole debacle never ran into him again i i remember one one thing that kind of 
[02:13:30]  went was i screwed up really bad i was on a plane and i was looking at this magazine and it was a  celebrity living thing all of a sudden there was a richard belzer page and cassie del hogan or  something over in france oh shit and i looked at it and as i read the article you know they were  talking about what happened in the settlement and then he went and bought this home in france and it  looked just like the house i used to film hogan knows best in that my ex-wife linda built and  like an idiot i go dragging this magazine home and boy that wasn't cool no no i was just i wasn't you 
[02:14:00]  know you know the dollar amount whatever was in you know whatever that was being said i didn't bring  that up it's just i was just freaked right right built a house just like the one we were living  it looked like that's kind of creepy that is weird my ex-wife built an authentic french farmhouse  we know the house from the reality show but the one that why couldn't you pet the dog that drove us  nuts when you're on the boat right when you're on the phone when you're on the boat visiting your 
[02:14:30]  old house with brook and there was that it was the tears and everyone's breaking down that dog  that poor little dog it's like at least pet the dog jimmy hart's laughing that was a brutal scene  it was so intense of course it was that was a shoot though i mean that was like  at the time whose idea was it to you know uh go buy the the ex's house there  i don't know if i had to guess it was probably the production company because they were always 
[02:15:00]  trying to stir it up i mean my son would be on the computer doing his homework they go nick go throw  balloons at the neighbors  nick's not like that guys you know so maybe i don't know but they probably told me to pull in  there with a boat yeah yeah the dog's just barking and no one's allowed to touch the dog wow you guys  got a good memory oh please we kind of laughed at that one i'm not gonna lie to you just let him  pet the goddamn dog enough for this did you like filming that reality show it was uh it was cool 
[02:15:30]  yeah a few years were cool you know and uh then it got rough it got rough a lot of people didn't  want to work those hours and get up and when you're doing production i'm here what kind of  show it is when they're downstairs and they're ready to go at eight in the morning if you don't  come down it costs them money because they're on the clock and when people say oh i don't feel  like filming today or tell them to film with somebody else i'm like do you sign up for this you  gotta get your ass downstairs yeah yeah it got rough man the last couple years but uh it was fun at  first well they probably like it when people come down they're tired and a little bit miserable 
[02:16:00]  because you're going to say something that you might not normally say you're going to do something  out of anger that you might not normally do that'd be true that'd be true that'd be true  you're always in the headlines man what happened to the what was it the surf shop the shoe yeah what  happened man oh man you guys really want to hear this yeah sure it's in the news okay  why do you keep laughing when you say something you know what this is great i mean for the last  time i saw you guys was about three years ago for one of y'all's charities yeah we did uh came out 
[02:16:30]  for the wwe and i'm just with the red and yellow man this is another great run for us we're back  home again with the wwe and we got legends house coming out me piper hillbilly jim hacksaw jim duggan  tony atlas to many of uh on fuel on our new wwe network so i'm happy this is great you haven't  changed either you look exactly the same it's great to be alive what about me my chopped liver  or what it's without saying i mean he just he maintained you actually looked really good i 
[02:17:00]  expected you to look the same i i expected him to look like shit no you look great uh so what  happened hulk shoot yeah okay you got to understand when you come to tampa and you land at tampa airport  there's signs for st pete tampa in clearwater well when you go to clearwater there's a place called  hogan's beach about 30 seconds it's a bar restaurant we bring in djs on the weekend we  have three four thousand people depending on if cedric or diplo wherever we bring in  if you keep going to clearwater over where i live there's a place called hogan's beach shop which 
[02:17:30]  is a little teeny store i kind of set up for you know beach hats and suntan lotion and of course we  got the tvs everywhere and all the wrestling memorabilia because when people come in you know  it's hogan's shop sure so all this stuff like the t-shirts and the cups and sunglasses and stuff  that's our product that we make our money on you know but specialty things like a belt i wore or  yellow boots with andre the giants blood on on them or workout shoes i had that i signed we've got a 
[02:18:00]  charity called 50 legs where we get these prosthetic legs for kids in the area that don't have you know  a way to get them and so a lot of that stuff you know even though it's like a 20 dollar shoe we get  these corporations to give us five or six grand for the charity and all of a sudden we had this  shoe there you know and somebody offered us a couple grand for us and no you know we can get  more money for it that was a saturday well sunday i walk in the shoes gone i'm all right where's the  shoe so my manager ron howard not the actor but the guy that manages my store he called the cops  and he said we're trying to get about fifty five hundred or six grand for the shoes so the cops 
[02:18:30]  file a police report and they go all the kids from spring break stole it had to be all these kids  they're always in your store i don't think so man the kids are cool i just didn't buy that right  you know they're gonna take something i'm gonna take a little shoe yeah and so all of a sudden we  looked at the the video surveillance tape and the police took it and all of a sudden these like four  women came in you know probably about 50 55 years old and they were really big ladies and one of them 
[02:19:00]  you know it was about 200 250 pounds walked straight to the back grabbed the shoe and hit it behind  their back and walked out so the police took the the video and all the stuff and it i guess it's  public domain or something once they take it right like a deposition or something and and tmz grabbed  it and blew it up so there's this guy sitting at home in michigan sees his wife stealing a shoe  on tmz goes i don't know what the hell's going on but you need to fix this so we got the shoe back  but there's been so much publicity you know the clearwater police and now it's kind of like 
[02:19:30]  across state lines and the bigger agencies involved now you know it's it's crazy what  was her excuse she said she was blatantly drunk is what she said that's an excuse for everything  yeah that's a good one are you pressing charges full charges no no no but but the police are going  after i'm out of it i just got my shoe back as long as you got the shoe back yeah but you know but  the kids behave it's kind of weird to see 50 year old adults going in and stealing right yeah acting  like assholes crazy i wanted to ask you too i found i didn't maybe this is old news but uh you 
[02:20:00]  played bass and you uh how did you audition for uh metallica i didn't i uh heard they needed a bass  player and i was coming off a roll from being hearing not hearing back from the rolling stones  because i was i was on a uh a celebrity like a charity you know how they have the grammys and all  these stuff they have something in england like but it was a comedy show and so i was presenting  with jerry hall i said hey man i heard your old man needs a bass player i played for 10 years and 
[02:20:30]  you know that's pretty good locally you know back in the day and so i gave her my name and number and  she hit me up for merchandise i said oh this i'm gonna get a chance here so i said all the wwe  merchandise to jerry hall and stuff never heard a word from it and on that same note metallica needed  a bass player and i said oh my god would i love to be in metallica so i put the word out everywhere  i wanted to get an audition to be in metallica i'd never heard from them either what year is this  this is uh you're already big you're famous well i quit playing music when i started wrestling in 
[02:21:00]  uh 77 you know uh-huh and uh this was i don't know he's hulk hogan he still wants to be a rock  everyone wants to be a goddamn rock star brother can you imagine being exactly you kidding me  yes do you think it might be a little inappropriate though since you hadn't played bass in 10 years to  say to the stones i'm ready for the job bro they only do three chord progressions  i can handle any of those songs yeah you can probably take that metallica might be a little 
[02:21:30]  rock first dude the bass player they've got is crazy i think they've got long black hair  rob trajillo oh yeah he's off the chain he's great forget about it why the bass i was always  interested with guys who played the bass because that's like the bassist will always work because  everyone goes like to sing or the electric guitar i think bassist will always get gigs we didn't start  out that way i mean i was the lead guitar player and playing all these local when you're in high  school there's like five or six local bands one band's got a good guitar player one band's got a  good singer one band's got a good drummer one band's got a good you know bass player well i was guitar 
[02:22:00]  player in my band and you know once all these bands broke up a lot of the good players got together  i get pissed out i mean we got a guy named steve griggs a really good guitar player with like dwayne  hallman he played slide guitar and all kind of stuff so i kind of get i was friends with everybody  they didn't want to kick me out of the band so i get moved back to the bass player plus you're six  seven that's probably also a motivator not throwing out of the band but after a few years i got pretty  darn good at playing bass so that's how that happened what was the name of your band the last one was  ruckus we went through uh oh my god i may have a picture i don't want to show you my pictures 
[02:22:30]  wow oh yeah oh yeah i might be a couple of fun ones on there  no ruckus was last one there were bands called coco and there's several of them  coco what kind of music did you play we played anything that was top 40 off the radio to get  jobs and some original stuff we used to either play at the beginning of the night or the end of the  night right right that's when everyone goes to take a piss or grab a beer  no one's there no one was there or when everybody was really drunk yeah nothing worse than when the 
[02:23:00]  band that's doing a good job playing covers goes hey here's one of our own you're like all right  take it easy when you're at midnight everybody's jam you gotta play proud mary and brown sugar exactly  aerosmith you know how's i'm happy how's brook and uh the x doing we had the x in here by the way  wow she told she told she told a tale or two god bless you god bless you yeah they wanted her i was  we were we were team hulk i don't i don't know what we were doing that day we shed your wallet  anyway how's brook doing brook is doing awesome good actually um crazy she was in living nashville 
[02:23:30]  songwriting for a couple years fell in love i think with this guy from the dallas cowboys  moved to dallas that lasted about six or seven months oh shit thank god  then she moved to la and the cool part is there's my son nick is doing the whole dj thing you know  and uh he's doing really well he went to this technical school and he does mixing and mastering 
[02:24:00]  and all this stuff and all kind of commercial stuff jingles and he was in with this guy named poet doing  some black eyed peas stuff the other night so he's in the mix right all these guys so brook when she  went to la she stayed with nick for a little while and all of a sudden the apartment right next to nick  open up so they actually live side by side oh wow so now i know where both of them are yeah at all  times we had a great time i never talked to the ex or see her or anything so she uh and just  there you go i was going to ask if you're uh are you still going after gawker have you settled that or

[02:31:00]  now we go did it did did did did did did did did did that well they're putting a whole bunch of  things together great tv used to be yeah some real hits you didn't like my favorite martian no i don't  with bill bixby no bobby bobby moynihan for the first time on the opian anthony show hi bobby how are you  oh yeah what's going on very good sir i gotta start with this sam keeps saying you're a fan of 
[02:31:30]  our show i don't i don't believe it because we hear i don't believe because we hear it so many times  from people that are you know famous whatever and then then you ask them a few questions and it and it  falls apart and it turns out they're not fans of the show yeah no i i was i listened to for i was  uh no i used to listen to all the time in like the psycho mark days like that was the old uh  any w any w yeah no i listened for many many years my first um my first acting job i got like 
[02:32:00]  extra work in some awful richard grieco movie yeah wow uh yeah um i would and it was the day you guys  did the voyeur bus oh oh that was a good one jimmy got arrested yeah and uh i sat there i think for  nine hours listening to that and then they were like all right you're ready to go and i didn't go  like i went and hid in the stairwell so i could finish listening to the show and then ended up  not being in that movie oh man so thanks twice that was amazing you didn't get the gig though  i was there i was supposed to be shooting it it was like one of my first acting jobs 
[02:32:30]  and i just bailed on it but that's that voyeur bus was amazing yeah but that's a really that's a real  fork of two careers right i'm spending the night in jail with lewis black trying not to shit my pants  and you're on a fucking job definitely my very first one but i yeah but i never i lost it because  i just left i went and hid in the stairwell listen to the rest of it we made a lot of mistakes that  day we invited cnn on the bus thinking they would give us a nice positive piece on the whole thing  yeah and then she jumped out it was julia uh moe's whatever her name is and then she jumped out at city 
[02:33:00]  hall to talk to giuliani like he was going to be like yeah the city needs more of this  oh we got railroaded we got killed for that one yeah that was an awful day we didn't get fired  though we didn't get fired for that one lucky us yeah i miss spending the weekend in jail by a few  hours me and lewis both smoked back then i've talked about that was the worst part of it was  there's nowhere to shit because the cells are so filthy and bug there's bugs and it's just gross  and the doors or there's no door in front of the toilets you'd be shit in front of 30 
[02:33:30]  i would have spanish guys just looking at you i would have i would have shit i would have had to  i held it my no my body starts like yeah it's breaking down yeah now you start sweating and  stuff and body temperature goes down and i think you're insane then no about it exactly that's a  good move right there where they put your face in like a dog or that like you got one of two ways  so can we get past the awkward part and then we can move on you seem so awkward i wouldn't know  well we we we sam of course tells us that you heard us uh breaking down one of your uh appearances 
[02:34:00]  you guys are fucking assholes i'm gonna tell you to your face no no no no i i look at it this way  it's like rickles it's like i listened to it for a long time i'll like when i i'll tell you the  honest to god truth yeah the night uh i said i haven't listened i haven't listened to on a for a while  let me go on youtube see what's going on one of the first thing that comes up is oh and a drunk  uncle and i'm like what are what are the chances and honestly my first thought was oh no do they do 
[02:34:30]  something like call drunk uncle and and i haven't seen it i got terrified listened to it and then was  like oh no it's the complete opposite oh no it was uh it was a tough spot well yes try being there  yeah yeah yeah can you walk us through that because that that there was the 12 12 12 thing  and and seth myers brought you out and that was a really it was a really weird that is a contextual 
[02:35:00]  bit it's something that you need to do sitting behind a desk sitting behind the desk with on like on  the news with only your face up close there you go right exactly i will defend ourselves in a little  bit saying we were aware that was a tough spot but that's not gonna like stop us from just beating  the shit out of somebody oh i wouldn't because we would do we would do the same other way we've  done the same thing to ourselves yeah i'm not familiar yeah because no one was no one was paying  attention you jumped on my homeless cake 
[02:35:30]  i think you're doing just fine there bobby you're doing all right buddy who did you go on after  oh good lord it was the worst um uh i went in between kanye west and billy joel oh jeez did kanye go too  long i thought he they think he went too long not only did he go too long he was in a kilt and a  mask and just and the last 45 seconds of it were just him screaming i believe the word hate or just  screaming something just screaming bright lights down and they're like well here comes this fat dude 
[02:36:00]  in the costume right with bright lights just hitting the crowd just it was it was nuts he was backlit i  thought i thought he was awful at that i don't like i didn't like i just didn't like the stage  performance i don't get kanye west at all but whatever went over too long who are you to go over  when mccartney is waiting to go on he usually that's what i mean he usually puts on a good show  but what it's just in the context of it you have a sea of very very rich people from new jersey who  are there to like literally only see bon jovi yeah and chris christie's in the audience yeah and 
[02:36:30]  then in the fourth or fifth hour of it after kanye did they love it the audience love him it didn't  look to us like they loved no no i i would go as far as saying no might not have been his crowd  they were definitely waiting for billy joel more than anything yeah um two days before it happened  i got a thing from snl saying hey do you want to do this thing and i in my mind i was like oh they  asked me to do something like this is very nice yeah sure i'll do it and then very slowly found out  you know it was madison square garden and then was like oh no that's terrifying and then when they 
[02:37:00]  said you're going to get dressed before you go like in the costume before i was like well that seems  like a silly idea i feel like i should just go and get dressed there like an adult and that was  when i knew it was going to be the weirdest night ever was getting in a car dressed in the costume  and like bill clinton standing there and you're like oh hi oh no i have a fake drink in my hand  like it was it was pretty rough and then i think adam sandler went up and did a bit and it didn't go 
[02:37:30]  over as well because this is like a sandy relief right right and they're there to see the most  amazing bands in the world they don't want the 10 minute comedy bit in between so when once sandler  didn't do so hot and then chris rock went out and like did amazing for chris rock i mean even for  that like it was like he's phenomenal yeah they weren't having that either so you must have been  happy i'm always rooting when i have to go on for every other funny person to die a slow death  then i can't do any worse right that's what i always oh no i thought like i could definitely do 
[02:38:00]  worse right before right before i went on right before i went on chris rock was like hey man don't  do it he's like hey i got an idea don't go out there he's like they're gonna tear you apart he's  like is lauren here like let me talk to lauren i'll see if i can get you out of it and i was like  this is gonna be the worst and he's like oh yeah yeah they're gonna hate it and i was like 
[02:38:30]  and i was it was almost the best thing that could have happened because five seconds before i went  out i literally was like well i'm gonna see how fast i can get through this because they did not  want it and i i walked out connie west finished and i walked out to a sea of sea of people going  just standing up to go get beers oh like most of them going no clue could have cared less who i was  waiting for billy joel to come out and i just tried to get through it as as quickly as possible  yeah if you look in the wide shot you see me going like this like my finger like hurry it up make the 
[02:39:00]  monitor make the quicker can i ask you about that too you had seen the sketch before had you done  that one before or how much time did you have to learn it and all that stuff day and like at snl  especially like a day turns into the two hours before you're supposed to do it so i mean like  we had a day and i was like i've done this a bunch of times on the show people seem to enjoy it on  there sure uh and wrote a bunch of stuff and then kind of didn't think about it and then once we got  there and started putting this stuff on the teleprompter i was like oh we should have done  like half of this like this is this is like oh i was taking it like like a weekend update thing i was 
[02:39:30]  like seven pages a good solid four and a half minute i should have done a minute and a half and  stage dived right is there a moment good for you on snl they never break that fourth wall like i was  like like it's as a comic i would want to just start acknowledging what happened like all right  i know he went too long and you guys are not liking like are you guys just trained to not break that  wall and just address what's going on yeah in a way i mean like i think part of it too is like if in 
[02:40:00]  any way you improvise or if in any way like something you do something that wasn't supposed to be done  like you add 10 or 15 seconds especially if it gets a laugh you add 10 or 15 seconds on and then at  the end of the show someone's sketch gets cut right because it's all live and timed out so  they they they don't let you do that as much yeah yeah even if it's killing you would think they would  go all right we gotta let this happen sometimes but then you just answer to the person who's like  the end of the night when you're like your your bet your buddy who works for 72 hours shouldn't they 
[02:40:30]  understand because they understand you know it's i mean it's happening or yeah yeah it happens and  they always have backups like they that's why like every once in a while at the very last thing of the  night will be a commercial that you've seen already a couple times and it's just because  they either didn't have enough time or they had too much time so they just throw something  yeah right fill it up yeah so what happens when you walked off what did you the minute you walked  off what are you thinking before i walked off i was like well that was the worst feeling i've ever had  oh and then we and then we rub it i know i think i'm getting too old there was a moment where 
[02:41:00]  they were like okay now you have to take pictures right afterwards and i'm still in the costume and  i'm like this feels weird like this is like a benefit for people like and i felt weird taking  pictures in the costume right right kind of did a couple and then i just i went in um what was now  billy joel's dressing room because he was on stage they were like literally they were like we don't 
[02:41:30]  have anyone changing their costume so you can just go in this room which was the room that billy joel  was in changed in billy joel's dressing room immediately ran down the stairs out of madison  square garden i lived a couple blocks away at the time and i was halfway home walking when somebody saw  me and was like hey weren't you i just saw you in madison square garden and i was like 10 minutes later  i'm walking home with my bag and then i got a phone call that was like your limo's here to pick  you up and take you home i was like i'm already i'm already cowering in my home i'm like i'm already 
[02:42:00]  halfway home you wanted to just get out of there i've never fled a building quicker it was the weirdest  you don't want to stick around at one point i was standing backstage katie holmes just looked at me  and i said hi and she went what are you oh no yeah it was uh what are you 37 year old man in a  costume in front of all the most amazing musicians of of our time what is the costume i don't remember  the costume like how is it a costume oh just meaning like a wig and like you know a jacket 
[02:42:30]  like any anything yeah anything not this yeah anything not you yeah it was uh it was quite an  evening our buddies on uh snl this weekend louis ck yeah he's the best i was hosting he's hosting second  time that's gonna be great he's been working on the monologue too his mom's gonna be really funny  yeah i can't wait to see it he's the greatest yeah he's uh one of those guys that just kind of  be 20 30 year out of nowhere uh victory yeah yeah just a completely brilliant dude too when he came  i was lucky enough to do a sketch with him last time when he was there and it was one of my favorite 
[02:43:00]  things i've ever done on the show you're coming this time huh no i got nothing i was too worried  about coming here i got nothing yeah that's another thing too is like also like you know  normally not no offense to any other hosts but like you're like oh i got this one it's louis ck  you have to pitch an idea to you're like oh boy oh yeah i've been worried about that pitch for a  week now going like how do you tell them yeah that's kind of the only thing in the world like  i have this idea where you're a gay fireman 
[02:43:30]  like whatever you're like an asshole how do you guys what if you just give a bad pitch to a sketch  you know is good like and is it just shot or can you ever repitch it um sometimes sometimes that  happens i i had a particularly like there's a lot of fake pitching going on there's a lot of like  you lie so that your joke gets a laugh on wednesday when it matters like because if you go  hey i have this idea and they laugh at it then on wednesday when we start to read the sketch they're  like oh this is that this is that idea so then they don't laugh as much or you've already burned 
[02:44:00]  that joke right so a lot of pitching is is completely fake but i've had i've had the thing  where i've made a fake pitch going like i'll just say this and hopefully this will get a laugh and then  i can move on right and then the host is like that's amazing and then you're stuck writing this thing  that and sometimes it works out and sometimes it doesn't but don't what do you mean the fake pitch  so they pitch it before what on the tuesday like tonight i'll go in uh after this at some point i'll go in  and start thinking of ideas or start writing and then at some point tonight uh louie will come in 
[02:44:30]  to lauren's office and we'll all sit we all get called in and sit there and every cast member and  writer pitches their idea but it's not necessarily what they're really doing that's gotta be uh but  everyone if everyone knows that why would they waste the time it's it's a lot of tradition right  lauren's into tradition yeah for that over the years louie said something interesting i was talking to  about about this and i'm like is it awkward when guys pitch stuff to you and he said no not at all  he said uh he said some guys like will get bothered if you don't use their idea and he goes other guys 
[02:45:00]  are more task oriented i thought it was so smart that he said task oriented like some guys just  realize or a writer will realize like okay this is the task is to get a funny sketch this didn't hit  but yeah well and the thing is you're so beaten into every week on essentially auditioning for the  same show that you're already on so every week it's like  especially with somebody like louis ck like we have a lot of people on the cast right now there's  i think it's the biggest cast in history it's like 17 people wow so it's it's harder it's harder to get 
[02:45:30]  stuff on now than it was in my first year almost but then and then when it's somebody like louis ck  where you're like oh i want to do something with this guy like you get like you start asking you start  getting into that territory where you start asking people like oh what are you writing like oh game  show okay well i'm not gonna write a game show because then the math and like you start to try  and figure out when you what you should be doing yeah i got this funny idea like what do you think  but that's why i love louis because when he came in me and a buddy uh neil casey neil casey had this  idea he's a comedy writer uh had this idea for a sketch and we pitched it to him and louis was like 
[02:46:00]  that's great except i think i want to play bobby's part and i was just like he's like i never get to  play like characters like he's like it's always me just being me and we did this sketch where he  was like a hotel clerk all right i remember that yeah and he and it was his idea to play the part  of the hotel clerk because when you're on the show you're just trying to write for yourself to get on  and i was like that's brilliant and it got on because he played that part yeah it wouldn't have  and he had i mean he helped us so much with it and like it was a blast it was one of the easiest and 
[02:46:30]  funnest things i've ever done on the show is there a sketch that you wanted to get on badly with a host  that you know would have been good that just didn't make it for whatever reason oh of course  what's one what's what's or what's one host or something you want to do that just didn't happen  uh i did one recently um this character this stupid character uh named janet i'm like an older lady  who's going through menopause and just keeps meeting celebrities and trying to take them home with her to  sleep with them um she's very self-deprecating and uh it's kind of they're awful and weird uh i did one 
[02:47:00]  with drake and it did really well and i was super just super happy with it i felt like it was where i  wanted it to be and then the night of the show i got like it was the first time it ever happened i  had like 101 fever i got bad stomach virus oh you're sick yeah and i've never had that happen during a  live show before so i did i think i did i had written three two or three things or two things  that had gotten in that week and oh damn it so it was like a particularly like heavy week for me and  then i also was doing chris christie which i'd only done once before and i'm awful at impressions i don't 
[02:47:30]  like doing impressions what do you do original characters more yeah i try to um or then more  whatever fat person is in the news and uh i'll come in i'm like hey i've been working on a pendulet  and they're like you're wendy the snapple lady i get put in a lot of shapes um but uh i did chris  christie and you can see it on camera like i start sweating and then that was it like i didn't come 
[02:48:00]  back till the last sketch of the night because i was just throwing up oh you were passed out the  entire time food poisoning or uh i just had some crazy stomach virus just for like three or four  days it was just i was a heavy smoker i haven't had a cigarette in three months since then because  that night like i was so like the guy i think i'm dying i was yeah the best was going up to lauren  and he's in between dress and air and he's like um so you know how you feeling and i'm like i i'm like  37 years old my chin starts to quiver i'm like i don't know if i can do this wow and he just looked  at me very blank and he went but how are you feeling oh i just kind of repeated it again and 
[02:48:30]  i was like oh that oh i'm i have to do this there's no there's no one else who's gonna play  chris christie so it was did you pull it off uh yeah i think i mean i i haven't i i i'll be honest  i haven't gone back and watched that one we can do that right now if you'd like i was waiting for  you guys i was waiting to just come in and hear you guys playing the old drunk uncle stuff i was  like you just gave us an hour of radio for tomorrow oh man i'm not gonna do that again 
[02:49:00]  have you uh have you met anybody that you've done on the show like christy and yeah i met him he was  super super nice uh he was super nice had he seen uh what you've done yeah he loved it uh he i think  he the day after he the only thing he said was like i loved it i just wish you would have let me  come say live from new york and then like he was there a couple weeks later he did update  he came on and he came on and did the show he's been very nice he sent a nice letter to my family  which was very wow oh wow wonderful i audited them because they live in new jersey right 
[02:49:30]  it was uh don't do that again that's cool that's cool guy fieri uh very i played him on the show and  he yes who played did you do the hairdresser thing i we didn't we didn't we didn't i think it was an  off week anytime someone yeah every time something happens with someone that i play  on the show it's always like oh we go everything was hilarious yeah was it extreme  he sent me a lot of text they're spelled the way that he talks like yes of course that was off 
[02:50:00]  the hook like he's the greatest he does our show a lot we like him so yeah when you do it with the  news it has to be topical right like so he had that hairdresser fight you guys are off you can't  do it in two weeks well you you can but then then you you look at like what daily show and all like  late night and all those shows like did they they've had a week and a half of doing those jokes so  sometimes you'll do it and then falls flat either that or like they've already gotten all the that 
[02:50:30]  is hilarious look at this guy's like it is that amazing jesus christ it looks just like him  yeah but your eyes are open really why oh yeah god what's the what's the worst bomb you've had like  uh in in in like uh like one on the show that you're like oh god i'm on live on the air and this  is not going um wow i don't know that's the part that's starting to interrupt you that's the part  that amazes me about you guys is the way you can hold it together in a sketch and doing stand-up  it's almost easier because you can break it and go like all right and then try to get a laugh but 
[02:51:00]  when you're committed to a fucking sketch man that's right you're stuck in all right you have nowhere to go  updates kind of the only time when you can get away with that stuff if you're i haven't i've been  lucky enough that i've been never been in a sketch where something went wrong like i was in  well i was in one with kevin hart it's like the last sketch of the night and we were running out of  time and they just started pulling cue cards out oh my god kevin hart you can kind of see his head  going like with them like you're just oh you're just reading cue cards like that's it like you're  essentially reading on live television right sometimes for the first time like i've been in some 
[02:51:30]  sketches where i've come out and there's brand new stuff there because a writer didn't get to you  in time like didn't get to you before so you're just reading brand new things and live it's terrifying  but i've i've we did one sketch with the jude law show where i was in a cop costume getting ready to  go on and they were like we're not doing that we're doing a different sketch and it was like you  have 30 side 30 seconds to change into like this white old like a like a 70s style white suit a 
[02:52:00]  turban a beard and then you can see it on air like as i sit down in the chair they're still putting the  walls up for the sketch and like we just made it but you can see the guy's fingers holding it up the  whole time because they didn't have time to secure it and then you're like that i remember that being  like oh i'm on turn it live like this could go wrong at any second and then the second it was over  was the good nights i went to change and inside my suit it said j belushi and i was like  wow like that's the craziest thing in the world that was his yeah it was either his or jim belushi 
[02:52:30]  as well oh yeah oh wow i never can see it i actually found a picture upstairs with him in that  why don't you just take it home in that suit i would have i would have if i had known better now  if i had known if i had been there longer that was like my first or second year if i was there  now i would have mysteriously just fired for pilfering yeah yeah how long have you been in paris  how many years uh six now we're up to six already wow yeah what uh what do you do like to do on the  off time anything fun um yeah i mean uh when the show is on that's pretty much all i do i mean other 
[02:53:00]  yeah that only working yeah it's like a whole week yeah i mean for a school year for a school year  you're just worrying about trying to get stuff on but you get summers off yeah it's like summer  that's gonna be there now now i've been there long enough that they i get to do other stuff are  they still doing those long hours too where you're there just 20 hours at a time yeah it depends i  mean you kind of make your own hours a little bit but yeah if it's like a week like this where  you're like i want to get something on like because it's louis ck you know like you're really 
[02:53:30]  excited we've been off for a while like you know like yeah i'll probably go in tonight for pitch and  then i'll go back tomorrow at like one depending on how the night goes i'll get home you know i  could either go home early which is like three or go home at 10 in the morning shower and come back  for the read through an hour later you do that where you just get no sleep at all i've done that  yeah yeah not every week i mean in the beginning it was more of like i'm gonna stay up all night  because i'm on saturday night live now it's like i'm 37 i'm kind of tired i'm just gonna go home 
[02:54:00]  hosting he's gonna get all my parts so i'm just gonna go home like if there are there are weeks  like oh do you hate that when the host looks like you a little bit or has the same body type  oh the second i saw if you and it's funny if you go watch i'm not in the jonah hill show  like oh wow like i'm only in a couple pre-tapes but yeah that happens a lot you gotta pitch every  sketch you're right has to have two fat guys in it no trust me i get it  wow man you're doing this i said this to this chosen um uh the fx uh sitcom is it uh is that a 
[02:54:30]  comedy or is it more of a drama to cartoon you play a gay white gangster rapper yeah it's uh it's  insane it's absolutely it's absolutely insane what is the voice of archer um i'm this character i  used to do a long time ago kind of just started doing it for this uh he's just a real loud abrasive  um gay gentleman who does not care about what he says to anybody or and he's very secure with his  own life he just got out of jail for what uh he gets set up um by method man's character for a bunch 
[02:55:00]  of crimes that he did not commit he was in a rap group uh chosen was in a rap group with um  method man's character um michael pena's character and hannibal burris uh we're in a rap group as kids  and then i start to take more of the spotlight and method man doesn't like it so he sets me up for  a couple crimes i go to jail for 15 years and then get out and try and start my rap career over  and he's still in it what in flashbacks uh no he we he comes back yeah he comes back into my life 
[02:55:30]  because i'm trying to break into the rap career that i never had and he's already like a superstar now  oh okay after he fucked you over yeah you know the plot of every cartoon  remember gangsta fag there was a guy called gangsta fag who was supposed to be a gay  gangster rapper and then we actually liked his stuff but then we heard that he wasn't legit or 
[02:56:00]  that was a character right i think so there's a couple guys yeah this was like really like  hardcore broom oh he just raps about fucking guys in the ass yeah yeah yeah quite good  who turns out of that rogan was it back i want to say it was joe rogan wow i think it might have  been yeah i don't remember very good are you doing films uh a couple here and there yeah i've been  doing a lot of uh voiceover work and stuff i just did a couple pixar movies and then oh boy which  ones i was in um monsters university you were yeah who'd you play it's coming out um i've seen the 
[02:56:30]  movie a million times already the bad guy's little sidekick i'm chet i'm like a little one-eyed crab  okay yeah how do you know what voice i'm even chubby in cartoons do you pitch voices they go  like nah that's not what it's supposed to sound like or do you get one shot at it yeah no for  for this one uh especially it was i think dan scanland the director saw me in a sketch on snl and was  like i like that voice and then kind of i came in and did a couple different things and then we kind 
[02:57:00]  of settled on one thing and then they changed the character a little bit to you know like he had big  a bit overbite so it was like kind of a lisp and stuff like yeah just making it up as you go  oh that's not fun that's everyone loves doing those everyone you talk to that's on the pixar is like  yeah it's not a bad day you'll walk in you read some shit it's the best the complex itself is  absolutely insane all right oh really murphy's the master of those like they said no one is better  at doing like the fucking anime yeah he's just got it down to a science yeah it's the best it's the 
[02:57:30]  best job you can have just how you want do it yeah hold your paper read the lines  do it a thousand times and then they decide which one they want to use you don't have to worry about  it oh right right yeah it's up to them trying to find your character to show these guys but  oh i haven't even seen that yet oh that's just a clip have you watched this a thousand times oh god  monsters university is a go-to oh we just got the frozen uh dvd i've already seen that ten times 
[02:58:00]  i couldn't we've had it a week having kids and having it over and over and over again sorry  oh my gosh are you frozen too no no i auditioned for it didn't get it yeah josh gad did a great  job yeah he's the best at the part you auditioned for yeah oh you went for the josh gad part yeah  yeah yeah how close did you get i don't know who knows uh very like did you get callback or  yeah i got brought in to sing and then do that and but he's i mean that guy's he's a phenomenal 
[02:58:30]  he killed it he killed it frozen really nice dude oh we love him yeah you what you're you're  kind of like sing as a hobby thing i used to when i was when i was a kid i did theater and stuff like  that i haven't done it in forever and now i was a heavy smoker for a long time so probably not  brings it down a couple of things to josh gad yeah yeah is there anything you got and call back for  that you came really close to and just didn't get then you've seen it and you're like i could have done  that i remember getting a script for a movie and going like oh i get to this would be nice to do 
[02:59:00]  a movie with a tiger and then like going in and getting called back and then never hearing anything  again and then hearing like the hangover well that seems like an i swear to god i thought who are you  going to be in life of pie the hippo that's the first thing i thought okay the hangover yeah i was  like and then like realizing i was like well it's probably gonna be a shitty movie yeah it's gonna  bomb yeah no one's gonna see that yeah exactly yeah but nothing other than that like where i was 
[02:59:30]  just like oh well there was even a slight remote chance i might have been in that yeah yeah yeah i  can't think of anything that uh every once in a while i'll see a movie come out like i audition for  this de niro michelle pfeiffer film that they did which i heard was an atrocity um what was that  one the one where they blue lupus on directed it was uh yeah the mob one where they're in swiss  some other dumb fucking mob movie oh just idiocy but uh and i gave it a fairly heinous audition  yeah terrible job i'm not a mafia hitman i'm not even a radio guy or comic why the fuck would i play 
[03:00:00]  a mafia hitman you freeze yeah i called it to play an fbi agent for something and i remember being  like did you you've seen my picture right like you've seen like this is probably not the best idea  yeah i always think of guys that should be like they say well you never know they're just going  there and do it because you never know what they're looking for that's true but most mafia hitman  i've seen look a similar way it's like i've never seen a lot of christopher walken all right  but you know he was walking by the time it ain't you it's not me yeah it's not i uh you did a movie 
[03:00:30]  with a good buddy of mine one of my best friends uh eugene cordero was in uh furry vengeance you  know i never so who did he play i think he was with you he's like one of your construction buddies in  a filipino guy oh i loved him yes uh patrice loved him too he was uh he played uh what's his  eugene eugene cordero yeah okay yes i do remember him he played uh he wasn't the supervisor or the guy  that worked with for i for the uh people wrecking the area there was one guy who was kind of like 
[03:01:00]  a yes man for the company that was ruining the area and then there was eugene i like i saw a picture  of him recently you never watched that movie never no no no the only thing i ever watched in that movie  was an outtake i have of patrice we were doing this thing where he had to go down the bottom of he had to  walk down the bottom of a hill and that dummy slipped and like ran into the camera at the bottom of the hill  i fucking i never laughed harder at anybody in my life and so i asked them to replay it for me on the  monitor and as they did i filmed it with my iphone i think i showed you guys i want to post that that's 
[03:01:30]  hilarious but just watching him fucking just like he didn't fall on his face but he just kind of ran  into the camera right and you see brook shields laughing at him in the it was really great so i've  never seen the movie bobby's gotta go knock his ass i swear yeah sure travis tell him tell him  travis yeah roland just told me that bobby's gotta go yeah but roland just wraps things up  because roland feels like it roland gets hungry yeah so what are we promoting we're promoting  saturday night live with our pal louis ck this weekend yes what else you got going on bob sam smith

[03:02:30]  bobby and i don't know why i said no it's bibby and they said oh bobby i was like it's a common mistake  and just for some reason for some reason it's stuck ah whoops yeah right on all right well bibby  thank you very much thank you guys really nice to meet you finally bobby no sweat i i can't wait  to listen to you guys tear me apart no no no no no no i'm talking it was an honor to be here come  back and see us thanks man thank you bobby moynihan everyone excuse me 
[03:03:00]  breaking news uh it's official they're saying that  the malaysian uh airplane there crashed in the indian ocean yeah all lives were lost oh who's saying  this it's everywhere malaysian prime minister they said they got enough data yeah to conclude that today 
[03:03:30]  finally they might have actually identified what's that jimmy i'm sorry i wonder if they identified  one of the plane parts pretty obviously like yeah yeah we're pretty much making it official right now  and then what prime minister's going to talk in an hour or something like that yeah soon i've been  texting with him but he said he said he got to wait  release tuesday release thursday saturday that i still don't know what those look like but i guess 
[03:04:00]  they do whatever pieces those are floating around oh a moment ago what did he see well i mean we're  behind all this stuff when we finally show us an image they've had it for what four days or something  like that yeah well the prime minister said it went down in the southern indian ocean  yeah citing new analysis but that's in deciding new analysis not necessarily data by british satellite 
[03:04:30]  company and accident investigators oh no reason you humiliate anthony yeah right part of my job jim  fair enough now it's just a matter of why what happened i'll tell you it is in the middle of  nowhere that is probably the worst place a plane could crash and since it wasn't even supposed to  be near there i don't know pilot what do you got objects hmas success is in the vicinity and it is 
[03:05:00]  possible that the objects could be received within the next few hours or by tomorrow morning at the  latest oh yeah is it reasonable as a gray or green circular object the other an orange rectangular object  both located in the search area about 1500 miles southwest of perth australia this discovery made  after another sighting earlier in the day a chinese search team spotting suspicious objects in the 
[03:05:30]  southern indian ocean these objects are not in the vicinity of those which were identified by the  australian authorities last week also this morning new information about the cargo aboard flight 370 we now  know it was carrying 200 kilograms of lithium batteries to be non-hazardous under the icao or  either because as long you pack them in a in a manner that's recommended and over the weekend new  details emerged about flight 370's path a source close to the investigation tells cnn military radar 
[03:06:00]  making the turn between 1 19 did it make a left turn shows after the plane made a sharp left turn oh there  it is as low as 12 000 feet in a high traffic airspace before disappearing from radar this same source  says the flight's turn seems to be intentional since it would have taken a boeing triple seven two minutes  to execute that maneuver malaysian authorities say they are not ruling out foul play other leads which 
[03:06:30]  relates to no ransom note no groups claiming to be responsible leads to further speculation  man what's up with the lithium batteries and why is that a bad thing on flights things are pretty  good and explosive they they tend to get a little hot and burst into flame sometimes why though i don't  know if they're just packed properly and if you got a short circuit in one of them right you know if  it's manufactured all fucked up maybe but if you need batteries over there can't those people just 
[03:07:00]  build their own fucking batteries at this point why are we still shipping batteries they just got a lot  of batteries over there they love their batteries yeah enough of them it's like what they use in a lot of  remote control cars and their toys and other things so i don't know maybe a little fire a little fire action  but then again yeah that doesn't explain why they didn't radio with a distress 
[03:07:30]  no distress signal have been sent plenty of unanswered questions yeah they need that flight  recorder that'll tell them they're gonna get it yeah they'll probably find it they'll figure out the  drifts and crap and the currents out there 13 000 feet underwater though that's going to be a little  tough yeah one of those submersibles they'll get it you need james cameron he'll do it no you don't  go down there james cameron always goes down on those james cameron he'll do it ah he'll swim down 
[03:08:00]  there no bodies are floating though the sharks got him yeah oh that's true uh yes can can i say  something sure everybody cares about the plane but nobody cares about the civil unrest in russia and  and ukraine that is true that's true you're right yes that's a much bigger story for the world yeah  why is that everybody's focusing on the plane and not that well because uh because we all fly obama 
[03:08:30]  looks weak oh boy and uh if you look at the debates from the last election when romney said that our  biggest sociopolitical enemy will be russia and then obama turned around to him and said hey the 80s  called and want their foreign policy back did he say that yeah and now he's dealing with russia  right now um because he's got no foresight the people around him have no foresight he surrounded 
[03:09:00]  himself with people that are as inept at governing as himself and um well what happened oh romney what an  idiot whatever he he saw he saw what was going on in russia apparently we did too back in like 2008  i think we said something about uh putin and russia and his little invasion america or us me and you  on this very program norton yeah nice we were talking about it i said it yeah how come uh i said  the chinese are coming and then that's pretty obvious too that is so why do we care about crimea 
[03:09:30]  it's not our business let russia do what they want i don't care if they take the whole i literally  think if they fucking start going into paris we should just fuck off and mind our business because  they're good people oh fuck them we care about the good people i think it's agreements with our  nato allies that can't be uh fucked with you know well you know because in in the end what do you have  but your treaties on this planet all these little countries you gotta kind of so if a nato country gets 
[03:10:00]  a little uh fucked over we gotta step in and say hey you're not supposed to do that yeah i don't  care either we have i would love the world now i would love a soviet union back again yep it was  a lot of uh a lot more secure just having a bunch of nuclear missiles facing each other and because  it kept all these other little shitheads in check the soviet union oh boy did they keep people in  check and all those countries had two options yeah you can either be nice to us or you can deal with 
[03:10:30]  them right and that was the option but all of a sudden the soviet union goes away and america's a big  bunch of cunts yeah so i'm happy to see them returning i mean that i hope they are i would  love the fuckers they were you'll never see it to that extent i mean you know not going to uh  we're not going to be in charge of like you know poland or anything i wouldn't care if they were  not like polish girls though yeah yeah oh man i love polish  pussy the same with that polish pussy i have to plug yeah go jimmy tampa go man go the 11th and 12th 
[03:11:00]  i'll be at the uh side splitters comedy club in uh tampa and then april 24th through 27th i'll be  here in new york at carolines so you can go to carolines.com for tickets i have an hour of new  material wait when is that april 24th we're getting there ready great yeah all right guys we'll see you  tomorrow thank you sorry for the delay 866 wow wow wow we are live with the post show on a monday 
[03:11:30]  i had to uh meet up with the hulkster he just got finished doing sway's show and i had to go and  find him to get some production for the channel wait till you hear what uh what we have for the 
[03:12:00]  channel a little hulkamaniac is going to be very happy yeah and uh special shout outs rolling did you  like hearing that i i didn't get shout out but somebody did 866 wow wow is the phone number to call  big guest day on the opie and anthony show hulk hogan was great dominic monaghan was great again  and bobby boynihan how many times roland do we have to tell opie and anthony to take a guest before  they'll take him uh many many you know yeah and i think they finally believe me that he's a fan of the 
[03:12:30]  show yeah and like he told me when we walked down the hallway because i feel so weird talking to them  it's so funny because i've never i've never most radio shows especially on the level of opie and  anthony are so full of themselves that they'll convince themselves that famous people or other  people are fans of the show opie and anthony is the only big radio show that not only doesn't believe  that celebrities are fans of the show but when celebrities come in they make them prove it yeah 
[03:13:00]  like no i don't think so i don't think that's the case yes yeah well what's your favorite bit then  i mean i would just take the compliments i would think if i were if i were opie and anthony but  yeah bobby moynihan was a great guest and hulk is a buzz around here well yeah i mean people want  to take pictures do they yeah you know what the thing about hulk hogan is because he shows up and he  looks like hulk hogan like it'd be like if brian cranston were coming in here yeah except he were dressed 
[03:13:30]  up like heisenberg like uh like he was getting his uh food order he goes i'm gonna take mustard i said  should she order spicy he goes yes brother man and were you just so excited and then i said  he goes cheese like what about swiss and he goes go for chicken he goes i liked what do you think  so that was my hulk moment erock big day for you very big day so excited how did it go went very  well at least i thought did you have a question for hulk already in your head because you knew they  would call on you i had a couple yeah i feel like you got a scoop too i think so too i think it 
[03:14:00]  turned out pretty well he knew what he was doing past wrestlemania right so now we know he's going to be at  the raw right after wrestlemania but then he also stated his uh agreement is for a long time that's  what he well he sent a clip that you posted to my facebook he said he said oh i'm gonna be around  here for a long time brother yeah maybe till summerslam i guess legally speaking that means  yes i've signed a long-term agreement with wwe um he'd be the new general manager of raw look you're  going way too fanboy inside right now even for me well nwo come back oh sal who's that yeah i don't even know 
[03:14:30]  what the fuck he's talking about that's what i mean i look at sal and i go okay we're officially  in the zone where sal's like what the are they talking about i can't have that less that hogan  was here today you cared that hogan was here today i i like on some level i really didn't he didn't  oh wait wait you know what he did not care at all you know what i forget what it sounds like 15 years  old yeah that's true like anybody who is actually like any adult would care to some level even if they  don't like wrestling right because it's like alf coming in it's like that's the guy exciting right 
[03:15:00]  yeah like roland you're not a wrestling fan but the hulksters here it's a little exciting i as a kid  i bought the tape it was like it looked like a record of i'm a real american that song that's bad i was  a little holster and then but you know what it is too he looks he in 2014 this is saying he looks like  his action figure yeah and when you have somebody who you bought their action figure when you were a kid  and they come in still looking like that that's exciting sal was buying like i mean he's too 
[03:15:30]  young for power rangers i love i love power rangers sal is still buying action yeah that's true  if uh no not at all if uh like the edge came in or the undertaker i would i would actually </pre>
