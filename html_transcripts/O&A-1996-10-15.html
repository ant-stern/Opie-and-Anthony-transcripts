<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a significant portion dedicated to "Sperm Bowl 96," a planned on-air sperm count competition between Opie and Anthony.  The hosts engaged in boisterous banter, detailing the competition's logistics, including the judging by Don and Dave, and soliciting listener bets via fax.  Concerns were raised about the lack of privacy involved in the procedure and the possibility of one host having a low sperm count, using crude language to describe the scenario of "shooting blanks."

The show then featured a call from sports predictor Kippy Love. Kippy discussed her successful football predictions, her unusual fan mail (including correspondence from satanic worshippers), and a disturbing letter from a woman proposing sex.  The conversation took a sexually explicit turn, with Kippy detailing dreams involving lesbian sex and cunnilingus.  This segued into crude jokes about Madonna's recent childbirth.

The focus returned to Sperm Bowl 96, with further discussion of the event and listener suggestions. A female listener called in to express her disgust at the planned competition, sharing a personal anecdote about nearly leaving her boyfriend after catching him masturbating. This triggered a discussion about male masturbation, with the caller providing details about her discovery of her boyfriend's activities. Another caller followed with a rambling, incoherent story, resulting in further nonsensical conversation between Opie and Anthony.  The show concluded with mentions of upcoming events and scheduled musical guests.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's on, Sperm Bowl 96, three days away!  Oh boy.  72 hours and counting. You're gonna lose, Anthony.  Yeah, I got more sperm than you. Stop it.  I don't think so. Gravity kills. AAF.  WAF, the only station that really rocks. It's Opie and Anthony.  Gotta tell people about Ticket Blitz Thursday.  A wonderful feature here at AAF.  In the morning, Hillman's got tickets to see George Carlin at Symphony Hall.  Ozone's got tickets to see Rush.  We got tickets to see Kicking Harold. 
[00:00:30]  And Rocco turns you on to tickets to see Marilyn Manson at Avalon.  Ticket Blitz Thursday starts with the Hillman, 6 a.m. Thursday morning with WAF.  Hey, if you're just tuning in, it's official.  Sperm Bowl 96 will be happening Friday.  Three days and counting before Sperm Bowl 96.  Banking your way.  Wow.  Dude, I'm serious. I want you to spot me at least a mil.  Well, I'm not spotting you any sperm. 
[00:01:00]  You got to spot me at least a mil.  The odds makers in Vegas have already given you the favorite.  And the reason is because you're Italian.  And supposedly Italians have...  Racist. What a racist remark that is.  I've been doing my research, man.  Italians have more of those little buggers than a white kid like me.  Well, buy something then from somebody else.  Come on, spot me like a half mil.  Come on.  I'm not spotting you any.  We need some kind of odds.  You got to spot me.  You will not get odds.  What?  It is a head-to-head competition. 
[00:01:30]  I don't think so.  Maybe back-to-back, but not head-to-head.  Okay?  Come on.  I'm not spotting you any sperm.  How about spot me a quarter?  Quarter mil.  No way.  Dude, that still leaves you a lot of sperm.  Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.  Nope, nope, nope.  All right.  This is it.  Even odds, pal.  Three days and counting.  You can make bets on an over-under or something like that.  If you want to bet on yourself or something like that, that's fine.  All right.  We'll start sending the bets in through the fax machine.  9-3-1-1-0-7-3.  72 hours from right now, somebody will be doing the deed live on this radio show. 
[00:02:00]  That is disgusting.  And we got Don and Dave, the official judges.  They're coming in with their cups and their...  Where the hell...  And their microscopes.  Where is there any privacy in this studio?  We'll have to figure it out somehow, man.  Go into the storage closet to get the prizes?  We can do that.  Thank you.  What's on this CD?  Is that going to give something away?  We can do that.  It's going to happen Friday, though.  I don't know.  Oh, man.  This is going to be the talk of the town.  I want to go into the boss's office.  Yeah.  What if one of us shoots blanks? 
[00:02:30]  It is a possibility.  Have you ever been tested?  No.  Honestly, I haven't.  Neither have I.  So, I mean, it can get very embarrassing if someone is shooting blanks.  All of a sudden, it's like, I don't know if you want this on the air or not.  Right.  But you're spitting dust.  Three.  Wow.  Three million?  No, no.  300,000?  No.  No, three.  You got three.  And two are retarded and one is crippled.  I was going to say, but the good news is one of them swims like Mark Spitz. 
[00:03:00]  Mark Spitz, yeah.  All right.  We are 72 hours away from Spurball 96.  Oh, boy.  Man, I don't think any stupid DJ will be able to rip this one off.  This is going to be wacky.  They're actually spanking the monkey on the air, Al Pac.  Oh, man.  It's outrageous.  All right.  It will happen on Friday.  And we got to call Ian, our cameraman, to get it on the WAF Real Rock.  How the hell is that going to be televised?  I don't know.  We'll figure out a way to do it.  That's for sure. 
[00:03:30]  All right?  All right.  Porno.  Hey, on the way.  We got Kippy Love.  She called earlier.  It was pretty freaking funny.  Stick around for that.  I'm getting hung up on my dewey decimals.  Whoa, what's going on?  I want to rage.  Where's the pit?  Dude.  Ugh.  How did I end up with the flat polyester pants and wingtips?  Opening minds and changing lives all over the place.  WAF shirts, hats, and now wallets are all available at UBury Comics from 107.3 WAF. 
[00:04:00]  UBury Comics from 107.3 WAF. 
[00:04:30]  Even bet.  I've done a lot of research.  Italians have more of those little buggers.  That is a rumor.  It's one of those racially motivated rumors.  Well, spot me a field goal.  I'm not spotting you anything.  Come on.  We go at this.  If you want to train a little harder and try to get that count up before Friday, do whatever  you got to do at home.  Put ice cubes down your underwear.  All right.  Well, so far, the early odds are in your favor. 
[00:05:00]  A lot of people are going for Anthony to win Sperm Bowl 96.  You can't have any sex.  No.  For a week, man.  Wow.  Well, no.  Three days and counting.  Three days.  Three days.  Three days.  That's probably pretty cool.  That'll build it up a little bit.  Hey, earlier we talked to Kippy Love because she did really well with her football picks  this weekend.  She went four for five, our chick with nuts from P-Town, and this is how it sounded earlier.  Salonis Paul.  Kippy Love!  Kippy.  Oh, Anthony and Opie, is it you? 
[00:05:30]  Is it really you?  Hi.  We couldn't talk to you yesterday because of the Columbus holiday, but we just want to  check in and say congratulations.  You did great on your football picks once again.  Four for five.  Four for five.  Are you kidding me?  You only missed the Bills-Dolphins game.  You picked the Bills, and of course the Dolphins won this weekend.  I can't believe it.  But you're 22-9 on the season.  Wow.  Is that good?  That's really good.  Oh, how exciting.  I'm so excited.  So how's P-Town treating you?  P-Town is good.  I've been getting a lot of fan mail. 
[00:06:00]  Uh-huh.  You know, it's really, really nice to get letters, but I'm really not interested in getting  letters from satanic worshippers.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  It sounds like you have a story.  All satanic worshippers, please don't send me any letters.  I'm a child of the universe.  I'm not into the dark side.  I'm a child of the light.  Please don't send me any dark letters.  Well, I've seen your picture.  Maybe you should be a child of the dark.  No, I shouldn't.  Honey, I'm Lily White. 
[00:06:30]  Lily?  I had you pegged for more of a pansy.  Oh, dude.  Ah, come on.  Sorry.  That was there.  I had to do it.  It was a slow pitch right up the middle.  You had to hit it over the fence, I guess.  Now, Kippy, have you gotten any strange letters yet?  Yeah.  A girl sent me a letter, and she wants to have sex with me, and it really freaked me out.  Wow.  I was traumatized by it.  I had dreams about being a lesbian last night, and I had dreams about cunnilingus, and it  terrified me.  I woke up covered in sweat this morning. 
[00:07:00]  So that was sweat?  I woke up covered in sweat this morning with Wedgewood.  Is it called Wedgewood?  Wedgewood.  Wedgewood.  That's China.  Woodchuck, whatever you want to call it.  What's it called?  Willywed?  Wizwood.  Wizwood.  I woke up with Wizwood.  Oh, my God.  That must have scared the hell out of you.  It really freaked me out.  But, you know, I'm not ruling it out, you know.  You're not ruling out becoming a lesbian?  No, because I think that bisexuality is a very trendy thing for the 90s. 
[00:07:30]  But you're still a guy trying to become a girl, and then when you become a girl, you're  going to become a lesbian?  No, I don't think so, no.  I know people that do that, but it's not really, no.  Madonna had her stupid baby.  What do you think?  She did.  She had her baby, finally.  Right.  Did it crawl out, or did they pull it out?  I'm thinking they probably pulled it out.  I can't imagine her as a mother, but, you know.  Kim might put an eye out on those pokey boobs she's got.  Yeah, her boobs can poke anyone's eye out, huh?  Those cone bras. 
[00:08:00]  She's got the cone bra on.  Those Terry Mugler cone bras.  I mean, are you kidding?  Maybe they'll devise a suction cup to it, so the baby can just, like, push a button and  the milk will come out.  Well, I like her boyfriend, or whatever he is.  Whatever.  What, the sperm donor?  He's a hot Latino pappy.  Ooh, poppy!  Have you ever slept with a Latino?  Oh, honey, have I ever?  Really?  Ooh, I think his name was Fidel.  Fidel slipped you the cigar, huh?  He did, honey. 
[00:08:30]  He slipped me a big blonde.  All right.  Well, Kippy, we better fly, man.  Okay, fans, I love you all, and I love W-A-A-L.  Oh, everyone loves Kippy Love.  Now, Kippy, I will allow you to give out your P.O. box if you do it in your real voice.  Okay, all of my fans that wish to contact me, Kippy Love, can contact me at P.O. box  7, Provincetown, Mass, 02657.  Ah!  Woo!  All right, we'll talk to you Friday. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, no, it's her again.  Yeah, later.  Bye.  Bye, dude.  What's going on, brother man?  Hey, well, tomorrow the decay of our country continues.  Madonna's got a rug left.  I read the kid already has a lawyer and wants to put herself up for adoption.  But I'd have liked to have seen what was going on in that delivery room, eh?  What do you mean?  You were there?  Nah, I would have liked to have seen it.  Her driver parts see more action in the beaches of Normandy on D-Day.  Coming out of there must have been like riding a wacky water slide at Agalon Park. 
[00:09:30]  Hey, I ain't saying she stretched out down there, but rumor has it the kid drove out in a Buick.  Yeah, now I hear the poor kid has a slight defect, you know.  A defect?  Yeah, she had dents in her head where Dennis Rodman's f*** was hitting it.  Oh, you can't say that!  I just did.  Hey, but you know, from all that sex and dancing she does, she's got some strong womb muscles.  Strong womb muscles?  Yeah, when that kid shot out, it was good for a first down. 
[00:10:00]  Hey, hey, I'm glad it was a girl, though.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, now she can put pretty pink bows in her hair.  Uh-huh.  One under each armpit.  Ah!  Yeah, now you hear the proud mother pass out cigars after the birth?  Really?  Yeah, she even smoked one.  Sure, any excuse to put something long and brown in her mouth.  Oh!  Yeah.  Hey, and if you want to look at the kid in the hospital nursery behind that glass?  Right.  It'll cost you ten bucks and a two-drink minimum.  I'm out of here, girl.  All right, Curseman!  He's Velocity Girl and Lauren Hoffman at The Rat, Left of Zero, Sally's, and My Reality at Axis, Psychotica, and Elevated Drops. 
[00:10:30]  You want to go to the movies?  Hmm.  Uh, The Chamber.  That's what I would go see.  The Chamber?  You would go see The Chamber?  I would go see The Chamber.  That's pretty good.  How about The Glimmer Man with Steven Seagal?  No.  How about The Long Kiss Goodnight?  Geena Davis, Samuel Jackson?  No!  One star.  Chick action flick?  No.  No? 
[00:11:00]  No.  All right, well, the new NYPD Blue starts tonight.  Really?  New Sear fourth season kicking up at 10 o'clock on ABC.  And, of course, the Atlanta-St. Louis game kicks off again tomorrow night.  See if...  I think Atlanta's going to take the next two.  Wow, it's going to be tough.  Not many teams have come from a 3-to-1 deficit, but we'll have to wait and see.  See who starts the World Series on this Saturday, I believe.  I would love to see the Yanks and Braves in the World Series, because then you get to see  all those, you know, shots of Ted and Jane Turner on the sidelines freaking out, getting 
[00:11:30]  all nervous.  That's true.  You know something I noticed about when the Yankees were playing Baltimore?  Huh?  The park in Baltimore.  If you look behind home plate, what is that, Camden Yards?  Yes.  If you look behind home plate, you see the people sitting there?  Right.  There's no real wall behind them.  It looks like they're just sitting on bleachers.  The weather's kind of cold now, so I couldn't really tell if this is the truth, but during  the summer, when women are sitting behind me wearing skirts, I would be damned if you 
[00:12:00]  can't look right up their skirts.  107.3 WAF with Darla Hood.  107.3 WAF, the only station that really rocks Grow Your Own from Darla Hood.  Darla Hood, coming to town for a concert.  Don't have any details yet.  We will in the very near future, okay?  Darla Hood.  They can check them out, see what they're all about in concert.  And you know something?  One of the things you can find on the WAF Info Maniac Hotline...  Publess things.  A lot of people call for that info all the time, which is pretty cool, actually. 
[00:12:30]  But if you want to do it on your own, if you can't get through to the station, you can call  617-252-4AAF.  Also, you can leave your comments for the AAF programming department.  We hate that feature, because it's people complaining about me and Ann, but...  But it's good.  It's constructive.  Yeah, I guess.  The Info Maniac Hotline is brought to you by Executive Glass.  Call 1-800-696-1555.  And the only station that really rocks, 107.3 WAF. 
[00:13:00]  When you sigh, that just means one thing.  Someone's got a problem with something.  Yeah.  What's the problem?  Well, the sperm bowl.  Well, we're doing that Friday.  You're not backing out, are you?  No, I'm not backing out.  But some woman says it's disgusting.  Oh, she wants to talk about Sperm Bowl 96?  Yes.  If you don't know, if you haven't been listening today, it's official Sperm Bowl 96.  We'll go off without a hitch, hopefully.  That's right.  This coming Friday, we've got Don and Dave who are going to count these little buggers. 
[00:13:30]  Anthony and I are going to find out who has the higher sperm count.  It's going to be me, I'll think.  Well, me and Anthony have been talking.  There you go.  Me and Anthony have been talking about this off air, and we're getting lots of advice  from our faithful listeners.  Everyone is suggesting that we both wear boxer shorts.  Keep those buggers loose.  No.  No.  So Anthony's not going to do that.  I'm going to have sex right up until we do it.  Well, the faithful listeners say you shouldn't do that.  I'm going to do that.  For two or three days leading up to the event.  I'm wearing jockey shorts. 
[00:14:00]  You shouldn't do that.  I'm going to drink like a drunk, and I'm going to smoke like a 50s movie star.  I'm just going to have a cigarette in my mouth all the time.  Oh, man.  And we'll see those things come out.  They might not be in the best health, but boy, there'll be a lot of them.  All right.  Well, and you know what?  Party.  And you know what the loser has to do?  The loser has to get into a car and crash into a wall with an airbag.  Oh, boy.  To prove back his manhood.  Prove his stupidity.  And less than 72 hours away, man. 
[00:14:30]  71 hours and counting to Sperm Bowl 96.  Let me get my wrist ready.  So this lady has a problem, huh?  AF.  Hi.  Hi.  Is this the Sickos Opian Anthony?  Yes, it is.  You guys are disgusting.  Why?  I was going to leave my boyfriend because I caught him doing that.  Well, this is for medical research.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You were going to leave your boyfriend because you caught him masturbating?  Yeah.  Let me let you in on something. 
[00:15:00]  Every guy masturbates.  It doesn't matter how good the sex is, every guy masturbates.  That's raunchy, disgusting.  Wait, I want to find out how the hell you...  I can't believe you guys are going to have a big jerk-off fest on the radio.  No, it's called Sperm Bowl 96.  Whatever.  It's going to be a sperm count.  It's just the technicality that you have to get it.  You know, you've got to get the sperm somehow.  And you caught your boyfriend.  How did you do that?  I'm not going to say.  Oh, come on.  I'm interested in how he got nailed.  Because I've been masturbating for a very long time now, and I've never been caught. 
[00:15:30]  So what happened?  You came home from work early?  Something like that.  And what was he doing?  Where was he?  Living room.  In the living room?  Was he watching a movie?  Uh, no.  Did he have a magazine?  No.  Well, maybe he was thinking of your lovely face.  I doubt it.  What did you do?  Like, what did you say?  I just was disgusted thoroughly.  Did you scream?  No.  And what did he do?  I tried to be understanding. 
[00:16:00]  Did he jump up all flipped out?  Yeah.  What, did he grab, like, the cushion from the couch to try to cover himself up real fast?  And try to explain that he was, uh, doing what?  I'm not going to say any more about it.  Come on.  Nope.  It upset me very badly, and I don't want to talk about it.  How long ago was it?  It's like, oh, honey, I just noticed I had some dry skin.  I was just, uh, you know.  Yeah, I was making sure I was able to apply lotion to my entire body.  You know, so it's soft for you.  Yeah. 
[00:16:30]  See, I'm doing you a favor here.  You guys are sick, but I still love you, just like my boyfriend.  Hey, did you give him some good sex and stuff, or did he?  Yeah.  Yeah?  I've made more of an attempt since then.  All right.  Very good.  I just wanted to call you and tell you guys are sick, but I still like it.  Well, you listen in and get disgusted this Friday.  No, I can't wait.  All right.  Bye.  Gibberish that you're talking.  Oh, with this guy?  Oh, this guy is a nut.  I might have a piece of it, actually.  Talking about some girl and going out, and I couldn't understand what he was talking about, 
[00:17:00]  but I don't know how he understood anything you were saying.  Well, I was messing with him a little.  I was effing with him.  A little?  All right.  Well, this guy called up.  He had a problem with a girl, and there was another guy involved, and he's asking my advice.  So I decided to just start talking gibberish.  And listen, this proves that most people don't even listen to anyone, man.  Check this out.  Who it is, you know?  You know what I'm saying, right?  Oh, yeah.  Call him while he's playing, right?  Yeah, you know.  I totally agree.  Do you?  Hey, it sounds good to me. 
[00:17:30]  Well, what do you think I should say?  You got any, uh...  Yeah, I would just tell, you know, say what you think and stuff, you know?  All right.  Because I know exactly who it is.  I called the girl's house tonight to make sure it was her, and it was.  So I know who it is.  Oh, yeah, you know, because that's like, you know...  I partied with her many a time.  That's really, it's like, you know?  Isn't that amazing?  It's so great.  Is he out of his mind?  Yeah, I think so.  Twice in ten days?  Yeah, you know.  Twice in ten days.  She's got to do it again, too.  Well, do you agree?  Try and get a bet going that she does it again. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, I think it's more of that.  I think you should.  Do you understand, you know?  Do you agree with me or what, Todd?  Oh, definitely.  I'm going to call him tomorrow morning.  I'm going to bust his butt, definitely.  Well, I would if that, you know, because he's a little to say, you know what?  Do you agree?  Oh, definitely agree.  Right.  I understand now, like, this far, right?  That's excellent, though.  I couldn't believe they would mention it.  They're like, don't mention any names.  None of the guys in the place would mention the names, you know?  Well, let me tell you what you should do.  Okay, tell me, because I want to make it sound good for the radio, so it ain't too bad,  and I don't want to... 
[00:18:30]  You should definitely hit up with the girl and make sure that does not look, you know?  Well, actually, I don't think she is right now.  I don't, because we called her.  She's like, they didn't mention my name, did they?  And we just laughed, because we didn't say, you know, we know you didn't mention any names  this morning.  Well, don't worry about names, because it turned into a plan.  It was in Kapoor, right?  But, you know what?  I'm going to describe her and everything, I think, tomorrow morning.  I'm going to say, I know who it is, and I'll be like, Bill, don't do it again.  She's going to do it to you over and over.  Well, let me give you a little...  I'll tell him I got a side bet going that he'll do it again, and she'll do it again. 
[00:19:00]  I got to give you just a little advice.  What's that?  Just to make sure that, you know, because then if that happens,  God knows what will go on.  Do you agree?  I don't know, but you know he's going to go out with her again, and you know what?  She's going to do it again.  All right.  I know her.  She does it all the time.  She's done it to me.  Well, listen, I got to, you know, because the show and stuff, all right?  All righty.  All right.  All righty.  Thanks a lot.  Yeah.  Bye-bye.  Add to that story about the girl that found her boyfriend masturbating. 
[00:19:30]  Well, let me explain in case people are just tuning in.  Some girl found her boyfriend masturbating, and she was so shocked she almost left the  guy.  She was disgusted, she said.  And I was trying to tell the lady that you've got to face facts.  Every guy masturbates no matter how cool the sex is.  That's right.  If she's not happy, she shouldn't be with him, because I caught my boyfriend doing that.  I came home early from work, and I caught him in the act, and I almost slipped on the  oil, and he ran in the shower, and the movie's still in the TV, and he's trying to deny 
[00:20:00]  it.  So I go to...  A little typical guy.  He's trying to...  No, man.  No, this is a work thing I'm doing.  I'm doing something for work.  His hands are full of cream, and he's trying to tell me that, oh, I wasn't doing anything.  Oh, man.  Funny, I read a twister, swear to God, and this is what was in the box.  I got here.  And then I pull the movie out, and it's like, which is wicked, wild sex?  Oh, man.  Did you nail him?  Oh, I bagged him in the act. 
[00:20:30]  I threw the movie out, so he owed like $45 on this movie.  I mean, he used to get it five times a day from me.  And he was still doing it.  And he was still doing it.  Yeah, because, I mean, even if you have really good sex, a guy would like to be by himself  to think about how good the sex was.  I don't know what.  It's like a vicious circle, man.  Oh, I know it.  But anyway, I just wanted to add to that.  So are you still doing it?  I don't know.  I broke up with him, and as far as I know he is.  That's not the reason you broke up with him, because you found him. 
[00:21:00]  No, no.  He used to smoke a lot of pot, and he had no money.  Sounds great.  First Jewish guy I meet, he's got no money.  But you figure it out.  Hot smoking, masturbating, broke.  Yeah, the whole thing.  The whole nine yards.  Did he drink?  A little bit, yeah.  Whoa, honey.  Got arrested a few times.  Whoa, honey, you're home.  Whoa, dude.  You caught me joking the chicken.  Dude, that movie that you see, I read in Twister, and look what happened. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, it was awful.  Whoa.  Whoa.  I thought I was reading Twister, but it says Fister.  Must have been all the dope I was smoking before I went to Blockbuster.  And by the way, honey, you have to pay for the video, because I'm broke.  All right.  Well, have a good day, and thanks for sharing.  All right, guys.  Take care.  Bye.  Bye.  I don't think we're going to beat that phone call, so let's get the hell out of there.  We're out of here tomorrow.  Dodge.  Hey, tomorrow, man. 
[00:22:00]  All right, Local H, going to be on the TV show this Saturday night at midnight on WUNI,  found from the floor, A-A-M. </pre>
