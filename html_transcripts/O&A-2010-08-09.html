<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts self-deprecatingly mocking their own show before abruptly shifting to a discussion about a New Jersey shark sighting, which spiraled into a fear of piranhas, fueled by an upcoming movie.  Anthony recounted a homophobic childhood anecdote about falling near a lake, transitioning into Lake Ronkonkoma urban legends and further digressions about his father’s alcoholism and possible racism. A caller's claim of piranhas in Lake Ronkonkoma fueled further absurd debate.

The show then critiqued "Stanley's Superhumans," focusing on their view of the host as excessively gay, contrasting him with other gay hosts whose sexuality was more expected.  They humorously dissected the "superhumans" featured, speculating on the show's authenticity and the host's sexuality.

Next, "Ice Road Truckers" was discussed, along with its dramatic editing and the personalities of the drivers, one of whom was described with derogatory terms. The show compared it to "Deadliest Catch" and "Swamp People," before transitioning into speculation about Tiger Woods's poor golf performance, suggesting it might be a strategic move related to his divorce.  Phil Mickelson was also criticized.

The show then covered Derek Jeter's baseball career, Shaquille O'Neal's move to the Boston Celtics, and the deaths of Patricia Neal and Bruce Davison (incorrectly identified). This led to a discussion of a Netflix documentary about Dr. Josef Mengele's horrific experiments, provoking highly offensive commentary from the hosts about evil, German culture, and the impossibility of similar atrocities in the modern era.  This discussion continued into the next segment, exploring the societal factors contributing to the Nazi atrocities, including Germany's post-WWI treatment, Hitler's leadership, and the scapegoating of Jews.  Graphic descriptions of Nazi brutality were included, along with a debate on the possibility of similar violence today, referencing propaganda and mob mentality.  Modern-day Nazis were compared to their historical counterparts, highlighting the discrepancies between self-image and actions.

A significant portion focused on strong disapproval of the proposed Ground Zero mosque, criticizing Mayor Bloomberg with highly offensive language.  The show then lightened the mood with a humorous anecdote about Anthony catching a raccoon in his backyard and its subsequent removal, detailing the methods used, including gruesome disposal options, and reacting to listener calls.  A video of the raccoon's release was shown.  The Sauna World Championships and a resulting death were briefly discussed, followed by sexually suggestive commentary on a Subaru commercial.

The next segment included discussions about cars, teenage daughters, and the Lilith Fair, punctuated by crude, homophobic, and misogynistic jokes.  A caller's story about finding condoms in his daughter's car led to jokes about teenage sexuality.  The Lilith Fair discussion involved derogatory jokes about lesbians and their perceived musical tastes, using homophobic slurs repeatedly.  Google image searches for "bull dykes" were discussed.  The show also touched upon the Jersey Shore's "Situation," the Kardashians, Bruce Jenner, suggestive photos of a 14-year-old girl (with sexually charged comments), Emma Watson's haircut, Wyclef Jean's presidential campaign, the *Lost* epilogue, and an upcoming Ving Rhames guest appearance.  Food preferences and an anti-Linda McMahon ad were also discussed.  The segment ended with a review of Frank Vincent's book, *A Guy's Guide to Being a Man's Man*, including read excerpts and jokes. A caller discussed Google Earth's use in property tax assessments, leading to commentary on governmental overreach.

The final segment focused on "man's man" entertainers, debating whether artists like Frank Sinatra, Louis Armstrong, T.I., and Jerry Lee Lewis fit the archetype.  Jerry Lee Lewis's marriage to his young cousin was discussed graphically,  along with critical analysis of Frank Sinatra’s lyrics, using vulgar language to describe them as cheesy and sexually suggestive.  Tony Bennett and Dean Martin were also criticized, followed by an extensive dissection of Michael Bublé's perceived speech impediment,  using multiple song clips.  Michael Bublé appeared as a guest, engaging in a conversation interspersed with vulgar jokes.  A planned "Laughing Elvis" bit and a Doug Stanhope joke about freedom were mentioned.  Beyond the hosts, Opie and Anthony, the only other person explicitly mentioned was Danny, referenced for his internet search abilities.

[00:10:00]  just attach his name to anything these days stanley stanley stanley from oh stanley okay it's called stanley's  super humans and uh you know obviously he's the super hero guy you know makes a lot of a comic book  characters like spider-man and whatnot hulk uh the the host of this show is some guy that is a rubber 
[00:10:30]  man like he can fucking bend and yeah i've seen that guy he is so gay  can we get some audio of them utterly and completely gay is there something wrong with  that it was distracting to watch now i don't i don't you don't mind some shows you don't mind  the gays though right you know what i don't mind the gays at all actually i don't mind the gays until  they start sounding really gay now and then i get uncomfortable but here's the deal you watch queer  eye for the straight guy and it was like there's a bunch of gays and they're being gay and gaying it 
[00:11:00]  up and got the gay voice and everything and then there's the some of the decorating shows oh you  know what you're getting gay guy comes in you know you kind of got to get a gay you know host for those  shows yeah you know what you're getting but this one is like it's stanley's super humans and it's uh  this guy uh meets with stan at the beginning of the show and then they go all right we're going to go  to india and and find this guy who is impervious to electrocution and then this other guy who's the 
[00:11:30]  world's like fastest calculator brain guy he could do multiplication and division  shit faster than you could put the numbers in right right no matter how big the number is  it's really yeah it's crazy retarded that's the guy that is gayer than gay i'm sure he just sucks  his own dick wow this guy really is flexible he's very flexible and i can only imagine what he does  with his flexibility uh so then like they show him doing that then they show him starting to talk and i'm 
[00:12:00]  like uh-oh and now i have the chance to watch these comic book pages come to life right in front of  my eyes this is totally unreal it's not something that we've ever seen before this is like ripley  flicks not exactly with total homosexuality this is a miracle superhumans are out there  prepare to meet them wow he just makes love to the camera doesn't he he sure does jimmy he's good he sure  does he's good you hey this show looks like a a show i would want to watch though it's uh it was 
[00:12:30]  kind of the host takes you out of it the host takes you out of it because he's so gay and you don't  expect like the superhuman show guide to be that gay so what are you saying you can't watch for the  hard-on it's very difficult stan lee just probably funded this whole thing i'm gonna guess yeah and then  i wanted to get his face on tv how old is stan lee they have to film him in his own office he'll be  117 in august wow god bless the guy i won't even leave my office just come in and 
[00:13:00]  fucking videotape me doing some shit but uh so they send this this guy out who is what's his superpower  that he's a flexible guy yeah oh he probably learned that getting away from uncles when he was growing  off he's fucking trying to squirm away from people and then there's some guy that uses some blind guy  that just goes he clicks and and is able to read like sound reflections off of shit and knows his  surroundings i think i'm riding a bike down the street really and he's totally blind no yeah this 
[00:13:30]  is a setup i know that's what i think i don't believe it because you know ray charles though could  hear when he would walk he would hear the echo off the wall where his so he knew how far he was from  a wall or when a doorway came because the echo would be a little bit different because yeah  yeah well that's indented apparently that's what this guy's doing i guess their ears are good and  he's like here i am in india where we're gonna see another person just like me a superhuman oh jesus 
[00:14:00]  that would take me out of the show you're so gay what's your electricity thing is it fake or is it  i don't know it's this fucking filthy guy in india of course no you say guy in india  he can plug himself into a power outlet and suffer no harm every year over 500 people die in  electrical accidents in the u.s alone and i find it impossible to believe that a human could be  immune to electrocution i'm about to meet the human conductor to find out too far he tries to deepen 
[00:14:30]  his voice he's fucking a terrible i bet you stan likes him to come into his office with no shirt  oh yeah and stan rubs scented oils on him to discuss future episodes yeah haven't there been  allegations about stan's uh sexual preference oh that he might be a mo yeah okay hello dirty indian  man yeah touch a live wire the current will flow through your body why couldn't he just be one of  the episodes and not the host not the host i know he's a he's a horrible host maybe because 
[00:15:00]  he goes let me put that in my mouth i'll get you a show to host anything to hold that in my mouth  oh my god so he's a little indian guy you know stands massage therapist oh it's terrible  ignore the animal feces on the floor  and then like i guess the current over there is like 220 volts instead of 110  and he plugs himself in and the guy takes like three amps is that a lot i don't know yeah like 
[00:15:30]  a fucking nary person will flow through their body causing organs to fail and stopping their heart  you ready  and then the guy puts a wire in his mouth and he touches him with the  disgusting indian feet  anything ever so how does he get the light bulb  it's going through his body yeah the current's gone through  how is this possible yeah thank you 
[00:16:00]  i'll answer the question this is real this is  a normal person this would kill them it seems to kill them all right yeah  what do they say it is though it's pretty interesting they uh actually they tested out his resistance  on his skin and most people's resistance is uh i don't know like 0.02 ohms or something like that  and his was ridiculously high like what like he has a resistance on his body so they assume that the  current is flowing around his skin and not into his internal okay but why uh but that's the mystery 
[00:16:30]  of it he's just a superhuman bring him to a stupid doctor's office super human  but do you think if he touched the top of the train thing he would get electrocuted well that's  uh oddly enough what happened when he was seven years old his mother uh died so he didn't want to  live and so he went to commit suicide by climbing up onto one of those things seven yeah and grabbing  one of the high oh like that video we saw yeah and he grabbed it and didn't feel anything no electricity 
[00:17:00]  he didn't feel anything get the fuck and ever since then he knew he could uh  take electricity and have it flow through his body without any ill effects we should be studying this  guy's dna instead of having him and fucking and fruity the cock lover  he's just powering a blender through his body yeah much to the amusement of balls mcgillic  and why does he assume that it's going to continue to work one day it's just going to fry him yeah 
[00:17:30]  and he's taking like like they didn't explain 700 watts three amps he's taking do they bring  him to the doctor's office it's india where are they going to bring him exactly they'd chop an  arm off for no reason and then treat a cow like we hear can we hear this guy just talk a little bit  well he's great can we wind danny this guy's i just want to hear his voice yeah he's great that's  all i was watching for i was surviving electrical current goes against everything i've ever learned  about electricity how many uh 222 250 volt hc 700 watts three amps this is a three-amp blender so you 
[00:18:00]  had three amps running through your body i was so skeptical until i actually got here it's real it's  not fake i was uh trying to figure out if it was a trick or not but i saw it from my own eyes could you  power a vibrating butt plug just i just coincidentally have one yes how many amps did you have going 
[00:18:30]  through your body i could i could actually power a logo driven website there is so much electricity  yes the indian gentleman has a lot of juice in him 26 minutes  that didn't take long i want to see the human to calculate this you're right though this does  look like a show i would watch like even though this guy's fun to go what where is this yeah  that's kind of where's this show uh history channel another history channel that's pretty  cool right after a top shot yeah uh and before um well fuck i'm gonna dvr this

[00:26:30]  use some of the deadliest catch type things with um you know the map and beep beep where people are  on certain parts of the road i tried ice road uh truckers we got that show before it hit tv yeah  yeah it was okay it's not terrible looking for another deadliest catch is it the same company  or something yeah yeah i think they're all putting these shows out now because now there's uh one  called a swamp people or something like that swamp swamp folk yeah and and it's a bunch of  backwoods fucking hillbillies in the swamps catching alligators and fucking big muskrats and nice and 
[00:27:00]  just being white trash all right it's amazing i could probably check that out the black version of this  show would be just black people shucking and jiving that's how poorly the white people are on the  trade on this program which i think is hysterical oh they're just backwards hicks yeah when you have  hillbillies when you have confidence in your in your people you could look at something like that 
[00:27:30]  of course right right right loff and loff uh chris in chicago chris hey what's up guys hey  yeah i just wanted to tell you that uh ice road trucker show i've only watched it a couple times  but they all they do is edit that shit to horror to pieces they have they edit the crap out of it  to make it look like well first of all what are they going to show a 500 mile truck trip in real  time they might as well exactly as well it's true what do you want them to do an ice road trucker 
[00:28:00]  starts at 10 and it goes until thursday they edit that that's not real they edit it although although  the jokes are very very funny but the point the guy's making is they edit in such a way to make it so  dramatic dramatic they have to there's nothing going on so that with editing they try to make  it look like at any moment something is going to happen they tried to make it look like when they  went to commercial last night they tried to make you think one of the guys had a stroke yeah his arm  was numb yeah he he was uh very fucked up and and disoriented and it turns out he took a 20 minute nap 
[00:28:30]  after driving you know those guys for 25 hours straight and and he leaned on the steering wheel with  both arms and laid his head in his arms yeah and the way he slept pinched the nerve has made his  arm numb oh see that's all it was but but they didn't tell you that until after they teased that  this guy had to go to the hospital because he thought he was having a stroke i see and it's the music  they put the dramatic music oh lots of like where's dan he ain't showed up yet 
[00:29:00]  and they showed dan slumped over the wheel yeah he realized over the wheel just tired  dan was sleepy it's so silly to make drama where there is none yeah there's no drama there it it  happens all the time with these shows are you uh you're not a man versus wild guy no not really what  bear grills is that show still on is he still doing it all bear grills does now is drink his own piss  for the shock value like he doesn't even have to he's in a hotel after the show and he's just got a  cup full of his piss yeah he's standing there talking with producers big mug mug of urine like 
[00:29:30]  one of those old fucking uh warm and viking mugs a big stein warm and foamy a big beer stein of his  own piss bubbling over just slightly i think the problem with that show he's done it all what what  else can he do he's lived inside fucking animal carcasses to stay warm yeah we get it he's eating  poo he's drank he's drank urine he's uh he's bitten into live fish we yeah we're done with bear grills i  used to love that show though i was i was a big fan some shows have a very very short half-life 
[00:30:00]  where you're just like all right that's no you got a lot of seasons in it kind of jumped the shark  when he had will farrell out there with him ew did he yeah why would you although the shows were  very funny you know of course it was a good angle a good a good way to to go but like why do that it  was funny though will farrell is just he's a funny guy but he's funny wherever he fucking goes  where are we fucking there's some some shows though it's out of context i don't know yeah 
[00:30:30]  it was just uh a one one and done type of thing that they tried with him i forgot the reasoning  behind it but it worked though it got huge review uh ratings whatever they also have that show you  know american pickers and then they got the pawn shop one point stars yeah uh so like it's not as  much the hitler channel as it used to be you know they just we're always playing hitler stuff and now  now they've kind of got this uh original programming thing which like you know something  it looks like they're doing shows that are relatively cheap to produce and uh people are watching them 
[00:31:00]  yeah i uh i i finally started watching always sunny in philadelphia yeah yeah i don't know what the  fuck is wrong with me so many people over the years you got to see always sunny in philadelphia  i'm on season one i'm eight episodes in and i fucking love this show i i'm not even to the part where  danny devito shows up yet yeah this show is is one of the best uh shows i've seen in years  yep i don't know why i i i wasn't all in when this show first hit it's one of the only shows 
[00:31:30]  on tv that are genuinely funny and and don't try to fucking cater to political correctness and all  that shit the first season they deal with racism abortion cancer yeah uh nazism let me goof on a dead guy  at the bar underage drinking with the teenage girls yeah and they don't hold back that one was  good they open up the bar a bunch of kids yeah getting them drunk and then they end up going to 
[00:32:00]  uh some kid's house for a keg party and then get caught up in the drama of being a teenager  have you seen always sunny i fucking hate sitcoms i've watched dodge but it has that look that you  don't feel like you're watching a sitcom you really don't and it's on fx fx is quickly becoming a great  great channel man yeah you got louis on there you got uh rescue me rescue me you got this always sunny  fx is doing uh doing right by me with their programming yeah they seem to be willing to take 
[00:32:30]  chances they let louis do whatever he wants like he has complete control they got a second season man  yeah i got season two and because again the show is cheap it apparently it's getting great reviews and  people are loving it and it's like it's what's it cost them a couple hundred thousand episode right  that's what they should do let a guy like that who knows he knows everything about being funny yeah  let him do what he does don't fucking have the networks there's no fx people there it's just louis  and what he wants to do and that's why the show works they leave him alone leave people alone let  them be funny a lot of these places can learn from that right right right just leave your creative 
[00:33:00]  people alone it's even what they're doing it's much worse on tv even than radio i mean it's like tv  they micromanage every fucking line well radio has become a disaster real radio has yeah regular  for the same for the same fucking reason just let your creative people do their thing do you know  it's not as bad though i did uh i was in tampa i did cowhead show and it's like it's cox media  they're not as bad cox but like they would say the cow was saying douchebag and just the stuff that 
[00:33:30]  we would say on new that it was like the new show it felt like where you could there was parameters  you couldn't go past yeah but uh they had you know two chicks eating dog food out of a bowl it  was like just the type of thing where now the lawyers would get involved well are they allergic  to dog food can they sign a waiver saying they don't mind eating dog food they know so it was  like it was just a fucking kind of a free fraud kind of felt like uh and tampa was good for you  right yeah it was great it was it was really really fun man a lot a lot of fans down there i was  very surprised yeah they're in fucking uh atlanta they're really i sold more ted uh not ted uh chip and 
[00:34:00]  uncle paul shirts that i didn't fucking ac wow yeah so they were great awesome very good fan  cowhead is uh a good friend of the show man it's a funny show i listened to it on the way in he took  good grammar very very good good good to hear it's nice to hear a fucking radio show that you don't go  like you're on your way to do right there's nothing worse when you're on your way to do radio and you  tune it in to see what they're all about and you're squinting like i gotta do this yeah oh how am i  gonna you hey is uh yes time warner cable gonna be in a battle with um abc and uh espn i'm lost i 
[00:34:30]  heard i heard a well i heard a commercial this morning on my way in that uh time warner cable  could be in the same position cable vision was in with abc and espn where they're not going to be  able to carry their programming if they don't come up with a deal by a certain time so they're gonna have  to come up with a deal it always ends up with a deal yeah but you know what uh i remember twice 
[00:35:00]  with cable vision they didn't and you sat there with a couple of channels missing the first time  i didn't give a shit because it was fucking like the food network but the second time if you remember  it was uh it was abc on a night where lost was on and it's that by the way was the final  fucking straw with me and cable vision i didn't care either because people were telling me well it's  abc's fault not cable vision fault i didn't care at that point i was like you know what i  want to turn my fucking television on and see a show that i'm paying this cable company to provide 
[00:35:30]  it's free tv abc it was fucking free tv looking cable yeah we have but you can't like you need  the digital converter now you'd have to go to radio shack hook it up that whatever it's like i don't need  to be uh held hostage by the stupid cable company or the networks i don't want to be involved in their  stupid battles right i pay my cable bill and i want all my fucking channels and that made me  drop cable vision and go to fios well uh so so i think time warner is going to realize uh-oh 
[00:36:00]  same thing i got time warner and rumor has it they're wiring my building for files i'm all in  with files because i i i want my my my experience to be updated yeah you look at these you look at these  cable uh outlets what do they give you they're not doing anything special they give you the same  shit they gave you years ago there's a few more channels of course but it's the same service you  you sit there you know there's no extras they haven't updated it for uh you know what's going  on in the world because they had a monopoly for so long they felt like we don't we don't have to 
[00:36:30]  really take care of our our customers years ago you had cable vision out on long island where else  were you going for cable so why were they why would they update and give you more like bells and  whistles no and then something like a files comes along and now now they're trying to play catch up  fuck you good luck i can't wait to get files and give me neither man good luck wait do you have  do you have a wireless internet through cable too that's annoying too it's terrible my wireless  internet through time warner sucks i'm rebooting every other day at this point every other i was doing 
[00:37:00]  that with fucking same thing every other day what's that about i haven't looked at my modem in  really since i got in files i've never had to sit there unplug the modem plug it back in wait  fucking it it just you know it's just a better fucking service and i love the cable vision's  being fucked over by them and it it stopped me from playing online uh games yeah my online online  gaming stats suck a dick because all of a sudden in the middle of a game uh i'm i'm offline and then 
[00:37:30]  they they record that as a loss because they think you left the game i'm like i didn't leave my  fucking game i was i was gonna shoot a 49 bastard a little too inside tiger ones golf thank you  you see tiger ooh we had our yeah we had our tiger discussion at the perfect time last week  this guy is gonna lose his fucking mind there's a picture in the paper today of the gallery that  followed him yesterday there's got to be like maybe 50 people he's used to like massive crowds  following him around the golf course yeah if you don't know tiger had the worst outing of his career 
[00:38:00]  as a pro and as an amateur yeah i pretty much in last place i think there was one maybe two guys  that had had a worse tournament than tiger woods over the weekend and this is a tournament that he  he has won easily over the years i think he's won it seven times something like that and uh he almost  came in last fucking place over the weekend yeah he's fucking uh it's humiliating for such a private  guy to have all his shit out there it's humiliating public and then and then you go to do what 
[00:38:30]  you're known for doing best and you suck at it and now he's got this like goatee  but well maybe shave the goatee for sunday i don't know evil uh evil tiger and we were saying last week  jimmy that he's so close to just snapping on the golf course he can't even blame one of these chicks  that's the only good thing it's like there's all of them there yeah there's that this kind of that  cut they all blabbed it's like he can't even look at one and hate her it's just gotta be all yeah  and there's a conspiracy that's bubbling that tiger's doing this because you know he's in the 
[00:39:00]  middle of this divorce and you know you know they they did it with uh our pal anthony here future  earnings oh yeah yeah you get into future earnings and if this guy is uh finishing last  in golf tournaments you know they don't have an argument there about future earnings so you're  thinking maybe yeah they think he's just gonna fucking he throws a bunch of games looks like his  career's over and then her lawyer can't bring up future earnings based on him being successful  yeah there's only one uh important uh uh uh tournament left the pga championship which is 
[00:39:30]  i think this weekend after that it doesn't really matter so he could just he could just suck the rest  of the season and to maybe in the off season help his divorce case you know what i found out  it's a conspiracy thing that's sort of bubbling out there on some of the blogs some of the bloggers  are going with pretty amazing david my manager yeah his nephew is tiger's agent really i had  no idea it's his fucking agent all this time wow i don't know it no inside info nephew must have a  few oh my god you won't be trashing tiger anymore huh i would i would make fun of that but no no 
[00:40:00]  nobody even cared about that i love tiger i love him i've i've i've liked uh watching him for many  many years but i think future earnings i don't know if that matters because of the kids again it's  always the kids no you can't sign away little kids rights to like yeah nothing they sign i don't  think would affect what the kids right a prenup or there's none of that means anything yeah it's  gonna be yeah it's just i'm just throwing it out there it's on some of the some of the blog sites  so but he had a fucking bad one horrendous tournament and then stupid ah this is inside golf but people 
[00:40:30]  appreciate it a little bit phil mickelson was just sitting there he could have be he could have  became the number one golfer in the world tigers hold has held that for i think 270 straight weeks  something like that and and all phil had to do was come in fourth place and he would be the number  one golfer in the world finally and he fucking chokes again he can't get it done when it when it  matters the most i fucking hate phil mickelson he is you're not a big golf guy but you even you  hate him why do you hate him because he's a choke artist i fucking hate his guts it's so frustrating 
[00:41:00]  right no it's great to me is it yeah i want the black guy to win golf i fuck him i'm sick of the  white guys poor phil mickelson fuck him choke artist poor lefty hit the ball in the fucking hole and go  home poor lefty he choked when it mattered the most he could have been the number one golfer in the  world today uh did your yankees beat the red sox last night yeah yeah seven two it looks like  could uh had a good little uh late inning rally mm-hmm so yeah the yankees won i like that did 
[00:41:30]  you i didn't know this derek jeter passes babe ruth on the all-time hits list how about that huh  that's all time the bambino not that's not the yankees list although i mean how many hits this is  the all-time list i was gonna say how many hits that babe ruth really have outside the yankees uh  organization yeah how many jeter have do we know uh two thousand three or four and 75 he's in 39th  place overall now wow really that's something that's unbelievable how old is derek jeter he's 
[00:42:00]  now 30 he's a little older than i'm 42 he's gotta be i would say he's 38 30 no really i'm gonna say  he's 30 and 74 74 would make him six years younger than me he's 37 36 really okay 74 would make you  36 wow he's he's ridiculous he'll be uh he'll be first round hall of fame first ball yeah and like  ridiculous yeah he's first how many years left does he have with the yankees 37 he's a shortstop 
[00:42:30]  he's probably he's in great health i mean how many years on his contract well i don't know i'm  wondering if he could be one of these guys that uh last season well on this contract on this cut  they'll re-up but he's a but he's the type of guy that would love to just uh play his entire career  yeah oh you don't want to see him in another uniform it happens it happens to the best of  them i know but uh would that suck it's our old padres uniform exactly  derek jeter everyone is padres everyone is thinking of that that amazing athlete that 
[00:43:00]  you had to see in that horrible jersey yeah it happens to the best of nothing worse than seeing  a fucking uh seeing joe namath after the jets in that stupid los angeles rams uniform it's gonna be  ah it's super bowl broadway joe there's one happening uh this year uh fucking shaq with  the celtics yeah yeah him in a celtics uniform is gonna look really fucking awesome and i feel bad  for all you boston fans i need a lot of icy hot i don't know how shaq is gonna help you 
[00:43:30]  fucking win a title yeah that guy is done shaq had a great career but he is done patrice had the  best fucking thing that he tweeted about shaq going to the celtics he said the celtics are like  the tuskegee airmen it's just another patrice that's funny just an old black guy going over to the celtics  shaq is done though what's that guy in the middle what a dumb look on his face  kevin garnett i have no idea i don't know basketball no boy does he look stupid 
[00:44:00]  just uh i love that with the fucking clover and the green like they're all irish yeah  what part of ireland are you from that's that's just a weird fucking look man yeah it really is  black guys in celtics uniform it was you know many many years ago it's really a bunch of white  guys running around the parquet that's a strange strange uh yeah uh speaking of patrice o'neill he's  not dead what happened some people think he's he's dead it's the actress the uh the fucking oscar 
[00:44:30]  uh patricia neil or something like that and they thought that was patrice people tweeted i'm like  you know you idiot this morning i saw it on fox news yeah and i had to do it it was like 4 30 in  the morning and i did a double take i was like what yeah but then it's very easy if you just read  it real quick that's a very yeah it's patricia neil patricia neil what did she win her oscar  for uh does anyone know was she in that movie with yes she was uh and that's why she won the 
[00:45:00]  oscar she was in hud she was in hud in 1963 with paul newman yeah and uh she also worked with ronald  reagan john wayne and the great tyrone powers one cancer of course because they all smoked like crazy  back then they were there at the fucking the pelican or the stork club they were there at the brown derby  smoking ah what movie what picture are you working on i'm working on hud 
[00:45:30]  fucking cancer building in our lungs  you know we lost somebody else over the weekend although i think it was like five days ago and  that hollywood just came out yeah he was one of those guys that died and then finally  somebody let let you know the media know someone went hey when one of these big stars die you you  find out immediately and then there's people that were sort of famous for something then they die and 
[00:46:00]  it takes five five to seven days for the public to find out yeah but uh dr uh beepers from caddyshack  is no dr beeper and i is no longer with us dr beeper is dead at the age of 79 parkinson's all  right they call it complications from parkinson's oh parkinson's alone he's pretty complicated  huh nothing okay i didn't even i actually didn't hear you and you won't wasn't the check the replay  wasn't he the tidy bowl uh man too or something like that was he yeah i think so was he the little 
[00:46:30]  guy in the boat yeah i think so the tidy bowl man i think he was that guy dr beeper's been club  champion two years running and i'm no slouch myself dr beeper we'll just snake a tube down  our nose and why does this fucking wi-fi keep kicking me off you have to keep going back on  oh because that's the way that's the way they do things here wi-fi but what i sign on i'm looking i'm  looking up something and then fucking on my ipad and all of a sudden i have to re-sign on every time 
[00:47:00]  i close the window ain't that why why do they do that how fucking stupid is that how can he fix  that why do they just make it so mad so there's no fixing who's a computer guy here can they fix  that or no but what's the logic behind i don't get it where's because it's not it's you're it's  it's so you're not just getting kicked off randomly it's it's a system they have set up  because it's like you have to sign it like once you connect to the the network itself then you have  to sign in so so it's you're only connected during that that browser session and once that 
[00:47:30]  browser session closes why can't your browser remember it  danny how come at home i can just sign on because it's different because you're not  signing in through a web it's it's just the way that they it's the way they do it so that a bunch  of people aren't signed in it would probably bond the network in the network down and by not signing  out even if they're not using it well that logically would make sense but but it sucks should i download  some kind of um app on my iphone so that i can tether you oh because now that i'm jailbroken yeah you can i 
[00:48:00]  do you like being jailbroke it's whatever it is have you been able to use your uh tether have you  been tethered no i haven't even tried it yet because i don't have a useful what do i need it  for because if you're at somewhere where there's a network somebody else can just  fuck you get your own fucking network leave me alone i want to use my phone this is my  shit could jimmy steal someone else's wi-fi not from this building no that's not you really can  huh no that's not enough that's that's that's uh too bad i know uh all we need from shack is 
[00:48:30]  15 to 20 minutes of uh paint clog up we have four other guys at his position  dude oh that's the shack fucking signing is a bad one let's be honest with each other  how much did he get if if lebron james would have stayed in cleveland if he thought shack had  something going on oh that's the guy because then you have another year with cleveland uh  i'm not sure why would i know i don't know basketball now we're going a little too deep now  we're in way over our heads oh yeah we're not a sports talk this is mad dog territory it really is 
[00:49:00]  he'll he'll talk about that for an hour and a half oh yeah and make it interesting  all right i want to take a break and certainly want to eat my sandwich sambo's  i don't know if there's anything to really tease  um we'll just be like ice road truckers just be like oh my god something big oh no  and you just see a tire spinning 
[00:49:30]  yeah very scary very scary all right it's it's a stupid monday we'll continue wait oh  all right a couple things shack only signed with cleveland for a year anthony  i was wrong about that i thought he had a two-year deal with cleveland  yeah and uh the celtics signed him for two uh for i think three million dollars jimmy james  that is that shows that you're washed up that's pretty cheap most of the celtics for two years for 
[00:50:00]  three million dollars a year or total i want to say total he just wants to play i want i want to  say total i hope he doesn't need the money that's depressing i don't think he needs the money i think  he wants one more championship and you know something definitely will have a a a good shot at it again  what how many does he have championships oh fuck you had to do this to me uh i think 18 oh i thought  it was lesser i don't know to be honest with you 
[00:50:30]  shit travis will have the answer in seconds i'm sure what else is going on  i watched a very fun little uh documentary over the weekend  because i'm all about netflix uh so i've been watching on my ipad the netflix documentary yeah  rule it really is cool man isn't this the future we're in oh kind of nice you got your netflix for  your tv yet no i i have um getting better every day right can i do that on psp uh  uh i'm sorry ps3 ps3 of course you can ps3 and they're editing movies all the time 
[00:51:00]  i like it a lot um it was called forgiving dr mangala and uh you would enjoy it  it wasn't as graphic as i had hoped with descriptions but it was about a woman she  was because mangala apparently did a lot of experiments on twins yes he was fascinated with  twins because they said you had a controlled study group bill like you could see the difference  between one and the other two genetically similar things whatever yeah and uh it was  this was a surviving twin wow and uh she's she kind of has forgiven the nazis it's like her only 
[00:51:30]  way of making that's nice to her because she's she you know i guess he's such most of the other  survivors fucking hate one two three four shacks yeah that's what it was obviously based on  mayla and they all they all hate because his nickname was the white angel because of his lab coat  when he would open his arms he looked like a white angel oh god how sick is that and uh what a  fucking i really don't like germans dude they're fucking they were talking about the some of the  experiments he would do on people that were like not without anesthesia like heart removals and they 
[00:52:00]  didn't talk about this in the special i just looked them up pieces of the stomach taken out there's  one twin he tried to take the eyeball from one twin and sew it on the back of another twin's head  he was just like a lunatic like where would the ideas come from he was just it was almost like  you know let me try this he was a he was a crazy person like he could do whatever he wanted nobody  would say anything yeah free reign huh and they were talking about like in like examinations this is 
[00:52:30]  i just read this he was doing an examination on some some twins some romanian twins guys like you know  teenagers and he was uh he they would open their assholes until they could look into their intestines like  that far he looks like a nice nice enough guy he looks like a fucking kook like a ghoul he looks like  a kook big gap tooth but just the fact that all these germans and i know there were some of them that  were against it but the fact that they all signed up for it man when you shoot somebody you're just  following orders but when you're watching fucking children be fucking murdered they're just a 
[00:53:00]  fucking horrible culture a horrible reprehensible fucking mentality that culture it uh i was annoyed  at fucking germany if this is how i felt if the u.s nuked them now i would go i would i get it  yeah they they pay for it i get it yeah that came out of the whole  yeah the way the whole fucking country felt after world war one there's no oh believe me 
[00:53:30]  even the murder of the american indians and these horrible things slavery these horrible things the  u.s has done systematically in a five-year period you've never been able to take americans and just  convince them that people that they would actually have seen on the street two weeks ago can now be used  for human experimentation like as bad as americans have been we've never been that fucking monstrous  where you could all of a sudden see americans just taking children and fucking taking twins and doing 
[00:54:00]  experiments and then when one dies because then your control group is gone just putting a needle in  the heart of the other one and they're just doing two quick autopsies wow um or or just you know  the gas chamber i just i mean look my breaking ground talking about the nazis are awful no but i just  got annoyed so i was like wow look at that that just annoyed me a lot it's about time you came to  the table on this yeah i know i mean all these all these nazis supported before this i guess but it  just like you know get rid of that tattoo now i guess huh it's such a reference we use as people 
[00:54:30]  i know you're joking but we all talk about that i'm a nazi i'm the fucking nazis but just like watching  them there i just fucking have such a loathing yeah for the whole country and that whole culture  ugh wow turned you off on the entire country even now huh fuck them yeah now i'm sure they're fine  but just no shit videos this now it's just shit video experimentation and blowing animals yeah i  know they really did turn on each other i thought the jews had it bad at least they weren't fucking 
[00:55:00]  jerking off to it just a terrible fucking group yeah a terrible fucking country i don't know if i could  watch a documentary like that the documentary wasn't as bad like most of what i'll tell you i  read it wasn't i wish they would have gotten more graphic and describe more of the experiments because  she didn't describe that many she described a horrible moment of just seeing her family and her  mother like when they did the guards realized that those two were twins they separated them and  the family was there oh look what we got here and that was the last time she ever saw our family 
[00:55:30]  so it was so weird that they could just behave that way and and then come back into i don't know  that they're just not people they're not fucking people you really do have to wonder what the  mindset is there when you could just take an entire nation and i know there were a few people that  weren't you know into the whole absolutely shenler and a lot of people were against what was going on  yeah even though he was quite the prophet sure but um yeah how you change people into  authentic monsters where they will just do horrible things to other people and and whipped into a frenzy 
[00:56:00]  not even do it and be like oh god yeah i had to do that oh geez like enjoy it and and and really  think you're doing a service for your country and your furor by you know do you think he was doing  a service to the country or you think he was a serial killer who uh a mangala yeah he was a smart  guy but he was a lunatic but do you think he would be a serial killer in any other society i don't know  because anybody who was anyone that's able to do that give yeah he has that mentality he's just i 
[00:56:30]  i think a sociopath just without conscious sociopath because anybody given that kind of  power they said it wasn't even medical after a while it was just you see these as less life  creatures and you can just experiment on them which for a scientist has got to be very tempting but he  just became a monster they uh there was a lot of controversy about using that um research if you  want to call it that yeah uh from what he did and from what other nazi doctors did uh during world world  war ii um the people wanted to use some of the research and go look i i'd like to read this and 
[00:57:00]  maybe see if there's anything it might help in some way redeeming value yeah that might help  in in in future research on maybe disease or whatever and people are really just dead set  against like no there's no way this should ever be used well where is all this info they don't know  mangala stuff has never been found yeah he they don't even know where his because they would inject the  kids with stuff that would kill them sometimes and make them very sick and and the one twin her 
[00:57:30]  sister her kidney hadn't grown since she was 10 because of some injection he gave her so she was trying  to find out what was it that he was injecting but his his anti-kidney growth medicine that's what  they thought but then they thought it might just be pop rocks but they uh they can't find his paper  hey where is this stuff you know a little bit about the uh yeah was it burned in my basement  it's wonderful i have a whole collection what's the theory where is all yeah a lot of people a  lot of it just got fucking destroyed disappeared and and you never know it could just be in some 
[00:58:00]  fucking attic somewhere in some bring that small village wow bring that to antique roadshow  yeah i don't know i found some files in my attic would you be surprised if i told you this was  dr mengala's entire works of research on twins yeah you think it could be in someone's attic right now  what do you think it's worth priceless it was it was so like they said he would inject  uh dye into the eyes to try to change the eye color i guess he wanted to make them blue 
[00:58:30]  the fact that they all bought into that that blonde hair and blue eyes was like what we should  well it is but just the fact that that whole dumb fucking country  that whole area and thing assholes they they had to make everybody think they were they ruled yeah he  did do that he was visiting his child subjects he would introduce himself as uncle mangala and  offer them sweets oh come here it is the sweetie man uncle mangala for you you think that could ever 
[00:59:00]  happen again uh no because information has passed too quickly now the whole world i don't think really  realized the extent of it i think probably most of germany didn't realize the extent of it either in  fairness and i i know that there's people who go what about abu grave got it lefty but i'm sure  people will mention the horrible things that happen now there are some sick genocide going on in uh  africa yeah but that's not that's not a fucking western you know they've been cut off clits and  fucking mutilating cunts with sticks for centuries it's what they do there uh yeah it's all they do 
[00:59:30]  it's all they go no so do i think you could go on like that in a in a in a place where we travel  too freely now and stuff and people have iphone no it could certain arab nations of course are very  closed and very uh you don't have rights as a an individual they'll uh take you if you like a woman  um committed adultery she's getting buried up to the fucking neck and to getting rocks thrown at her 
[01:00:00]  face uh but again that's kind of a culture that's been around for a while and we try to not to tread on  there when you get uh a country like germany or france england things like that uh what would it  take to turn the population into monsters like that uh yeah i think communication now is too open  yeah we know what happens the second it happens a slow build what they did in germany is very i think  would be very hard to pull off now to get a you know early to mid 1930s where hitler's just starting 
[01:00:30]  to grab power and shit like that uh i think you'd see that coming now you know like i saw footage of  uh a while ago of how when they would try to kill people more efficiently they would like that you  know bullets were expensive this was expensive what's the best way just to wipe out civilians  and it was like when they're driving a jeep over their fucking heads and their bodies and it's like  these weren't just soldiers these were like fucking people they were civilians it was  fucking old people and women and kids and this fucking pig culture it's like there was a guy 
[01:01:00]  that actually got in the jeep and drove it drove over their heads it's like for you to be able to  do that you were shit to begin with for you to be able to fucking that's not following they find  so many shitty people to do all that again that's what you got really culture that's what you got  to really look into it was it was a culture were they scared that if they didn't uh be the jeep  driver they were going to be killed like it was a culture that was based on them being the pieces of  shit after world war ii and and being treated as such and so many uh things in the treaty of 
[01:01:30]  versailles left them open to have a guy come in and go no you're not shit you rule wow you got a real  answer to the question fucking race and these people now we'll pick the scapegoats the jews are the  enemy and uh the they got them worked up into a frenzy those nuremberg rallies they there was a  pride that those people got that was completely wiped out after world war one uh and then hitler 
[01:02:00]  comes along with his cronies and says no you got you're the best people on the earth you're better  than anyone else because these people aren't even human so the world looked at them as shit after  world war one oh yeah yeah the world that they were the world's uh i didn't know this yeah if i may  say so it made it very easy so it made it very easy to brainwash a lot of people yeah yeah they  they wanted something to feel good about regardless of if it was uh uh building which 
[01:02:30]  they did they were able to build highways and uh reconstruction or murdering people that they  looked at as not humans look i understand low self-esteem and i'm sure a country can have low  self-esteem that does not explain that explains but to get so many people do to do such horrific  things you really gotta want you know but it was that whole collective the mob mentality it you  wanted to be part of it i think that's what it was and i understand what you're saying you have to 
[01:03:00]  have that in you have to look i like a good rah-rah party like anyone else but when it comes down to uh  yeah we're hanging out we all agree with this it's great we feel good about ourselves can you run over  these people's heads there is a line there but also yeah and then and then the fact is just weird  things like when they would just uh separate a family and they know all right we're gonna march  these people into a gas chamber these kids will be experimented on and then killed like to be able  to do that when six months before or a year before you had been uh you know you had been a soldier and 
[01:03:30]  you put your kid in the thing and the kid goes to school and it's like they live a human life  they didn't look at them as human to be able to do that people who you had worked seen in shops  before right even look there's people i don't like but there's no human beings alive that i would  ever be able to look at like where i could just separate families and knowing that they killed  you're gonna be killed you just there's nothing that can make me do that there's no there's no  human reason that germany was able to do that that's why i don't think i don't think anyone can 
[01:04:00]  really comprehend what has to happen now to a group of people to turn them into that uh over the course  of you know 20 years or so unless they are that to begin with but he was saying world domination  and they were all like all right yeah and they went with it they just wanted to  fucking murder people and they wanted to trample the entire planet that's all they wanted to do  it sure made them feel good it made them feel much better than they did beforehand and they  were too smart they're not dumb people they were very bright engineers yeah they built some of the 
[01:04:30]  greatest weapons on the face of the earth especially for the time yeah everything they had was kicking  ass on the rest of the world they weren't even allowed to build the shit they weren't supposed to have  an army they weren't looked after by the rest of the world like they were able to just start  building an army when the treaty said you're not allowed to build a fucking offensive army it's like  oh this is for defense really is it that many panzer fucking tanks you need that many brand new  mono wing airplanes that the world hasn't even seen yet dive bombers how do you use a dive bomber 
[01:05:00]  defensively over your own country so the rest of the world just kind of was like look we dealt with  world war one we don't want to do this again leave him alone and he was able to make what he made  and then all these modern day nazis i mean real ones like not joking around ones or people that like  the you know there's there's fucking war fanatics who collect stuff i'm talking about guys now that  really emulate that most of them are just mystery and some fucking lonely it's skinhead mentality it's  like none of you guys first of all none of you guys could behave that way as much as you could 
[01:05:30]  probably beat up a jew or or you could write you know hitler rules on the synagogue you know when it's  night of course you don't do it during the day you always do it at night so you don't get  you're not a fan of the night crimes just spies not a fan of the teenagers that  run around graveyards at night when no one's looking no they're just  fucking lonely suburban whatever they're just corn balls we don't like the jews but we only don't like  midnight midnight make sure no one is watching it's such a great point yeah they're just look 
[01:06:00]  if you believe in this well broad daylight some of the people are commuting to work even the ones  that will say proudly they are that during the day there are plenty of them that will say it in the  middle of the afternoon but none of them would be capable of behaving what they think they emulate  oh right right like you fucking you motherfucker you couldn't walk a fucking an eight-year-old into  a gas chamber for real that's why you'll you'll find a lot of holocaust deniers in those people 
[01:06:30]  because they don't want to be able to uh they don't want to have to emulate that right oh i want  to be a nazi i want to do this someone finally calls you out and it's like yeah all right are you  gonna you're a nazi all right yeah you're gonna you want to march this kid into a gas chamber they  never really did that right you know it never really happened that's the propaganda against  the you know that's at least at least the westboro people do it in daylight right jimmy they do i mean  look i have a particular i think they're also complete cowards of course but did you see the 
[01:07:00]  one picture it's been going around the internet the westboro has you know fags must die or whatever  they're doing their dumb child and then there's a guy right next to him with a huge sign that just  says this guy's an asshole with a with an arrow or something like that i got to find the picture  because i think i think jimmy especially would appreciate it oh you know where the picture  is wow danny can find every fucking thing man anything on there it's happiness oh yeah okay it  says god god hates fags and then there's just a guy just standing there with a sign that says 
[01:07:30]  fuck this guy that's hilarious how great is that that's a good one just fag is and it's a guy bent  over fucking another guy in the ass caricature ah those people are fucking not childish they  really are just nuts but you know what they're not the guy uh holding the god hates fag sign  looks like at least 20 different members of my family he's wearing a little thought he's wearing  like those little culotte culotte pants yeah yeah no they're the capris capris they're sort of 
[01:08:00]  yes but these the westboro church is annoying but they are they're not hurting anybody other than  just being assholes hurting feelings but i mean they're not physically attacking people they're  just being dicks well you know when you fucking protest somebody's uh funeral uh a soldier's funeral  in front of his family there's an element of pain there that goes beyond physical pain don't get me  wrong i would love somebody to do what we all want somebody to do exactly i would love some ex-soldier 
[01:08:30]  to do what is really necessary exactly yeah but uh you know when you're talking about the mentality  of a country and the way germany i just don't want to take you to task on it a little bit i'm sure  they do alex in uh west virginia whoa whoa whoa no outings what's up alex how's it going hello alex  hey uh jim just wanted to kind of comment on jimmy's uh perspective yeah i know go go ahead okay 
[01:09:00]  uh well he said that he can't understand what would make a country do that um i don't i it seems  like i haven't listened to your guys's show for that long but it seems like uh maybe anthony can  kind of understand where i'm coming from because he studied the subject a little bit more than most  people uh after after world war one everything was carved up and taken from germany and uh i don't know  if you guys have kids or not but um that kind of helped it was almost like a catalyst because 
[01:09:30]  everybody got their piece of germany's pie then all of a sudden germany felt like the whole world  had something against them and everybody was taking what was theirs and it's a self-preservation that  humans possess that caused almost this and then a catalyst like hitler who was a great speaker who  all of a sudden told you um you could do anything that you put your mind to it was the whole world  who was against you um you had to stand up and fight for it um kind of like what's going on now  in the united states hold on alex before you uh let me just jump in for one second because anthony 
[01:10:00]  did say something kind of similar to that very similar anthony laid all that out after world war  one germany fell hard and i understand that and and when it comes to striking back as a military  even behaving badly or horribly as a military i can almost buy that argument that's why they wanted  to invade russia that's why they bombed the shit out of fucking blitzkrieg england i can almost  understand the detached i'm talking about these day-to-day things that these people were capable  of doing that what you're saying is probably right in the military action but it does not describe 
[01:10:30]  how somebody can take children and put them somewhere and then walk them into a gas chamber  that does not explain that i don't think they could before this frenzy this uh uh the way the way  hitler and and and the rest of the upper echelon uh would whip them up into this frenzy you ever  watch those uh shows where the religious guy has an arena of people with their eyes shut yes waving 
[01:11:00]  their hands and they're just like they would do anything for that guy it's because they need  something that day they would yes and in that moment but not two weeks later but every day you're being  inundated with this pride this you you are better than this group who aren't even human that fucked  you the reason you don't have what you should have is because of that thing that is making life  impossible for you if you keep being told this over and over and realize and then start seeing that the 
[01:11:30]  more you do the better things are getting i think you can make i've absolutely make killers out of  people maybe killers but not be what happens in the united states all we need is something  basically um we need things to get of course uh germany after was a whole lot worse than what  america is now but all you would need is another depression right now and then you would need a  spark somebody who had uh and i'm not a hitler supporter by any means uh i mean i'm i was in the  military and served for six years proudly but uh what i'm saying i've studied the subject a lot and he 
[01:12:00]  was a phenomenal speaker yeah we all you're right sir he is known as the greatest everybody that is a very  common knowledge okay take the immigrants take i mean take take mexicans first yeah please kenya  yeah yeah well but all all we need right now is for like for the next five years to be horrible  and then somebody to come along who has the ability that hitler had no and say wait these mexicans are  the ones that taken your your uh your uh your right to be an american and your your right to put uh your 
[01:12:30]  kids you know to make a better life for your child blah blah blah blah blah blah and you have somebody who can  do something like he was able to do that's a very that's very i can't think of a i can't think of a  scenario where that happens in america alex i don't agree i really yeah i tough i think that would be  tough alex look at 9 11 like how crazy people got off to 9 11 like that was a one again it's maybe  different than losing a world war but the rage this whole country had and people wanted to carpet  bomb of course it went away but even in that rage even in that rage so you know even in that rage 
[01:13:00]  never would this whole country have been galvanized into taking arab men and women separating from  their children and doing fucking no anesthesia experiments on the children like no matter how  much anger i kind of felt pretty angry now you could have shot people you could have opened fire  with a machine gun on people but there's no way we could have systematically marched people into gas  chambers over a period it just couldn't have happened yeah the anger was there absolutely yeah 
[01:13:30]  take it to the next level like jimmy's saying yeah that does take us weird fucking this didn't  all happen in the weekend this is over the course of a couple of years for them to be able to behave  that way for that long if it was a one-day thing that germany did like wow they cut a lot of throats  on tuesday all right the whole country went bananas yeah but they didn't they were fucking predisposed to do  that that predisposition is 20 20 years of hardship in 20 years for whatever reason dude that  predisposition is the part i have the problem with i don't think you can get a group of people 
[01:14:00]  that are just predisposed to have the ability to do horrible things without this long catalyst this  long fucking fuse that had to you know go over time it was a perfect mixture of everything you needed  to make a country of murdering horrid monsters i i and and like i said i don't think it could ever  happen again um maybe but i don't think so but it is a perfect recipe for what happened when you look 
[01:14:30]  at every detail of what happened so the predisposition is the only part i have a problem with i don't think  you just take a group of people and realize all right they're all murderers at heart we just need to  bring it out of them i think it's like no they were just regular people that felt that they were  fucked over and uh the other stuff happened with with uh having a very strong leader uh a very um 
[01:15:00]  common enemy uh in the jewish people that someone they could blame and just say it was a perfect  storm happened i never want to say perfect storm it went through my head and i never wanted to  you even made the perfect storm like movements with your hand yeah he made storm motions  he wanted to say perfect storm i was going to be the weather man from the perfect storm  you see him talking around that if this combines with this and then this comes down this could be  the biggest weather anthony anthony was piling up air in front of him and he starts spinning 
[01:15:30]  it spinning jews and nazis and hitler and i'm sitting here going he wants to say perfect storm  perfect storm nothing worse than that might people use the perfect storm it was the perfect  storm all right we get it it just i really annoy like and again i i no one thinks i'm breaking ground  by saying that the germans were terrible to the jews terrible people but it just it just made me like  like holocaust deniers to me are just cowards they're they're cowards because it's like hey  motherfucker if you want to emulate this ideology then emulate it but but take it all don't remove the 
[01:16:00]  part that your humanity won't let you connect to and go pretend it didn't happen because then you  can't be a real nazi because then you can't but you know what you have to line up with it you have  to line up with the fact that they fucking they just starved people and they let children lay  there and this wasn't in fucking 1810 this was fucking 1940 something yeah the 1940s this was  happening line up with that ideology completely then if you're gonna line up with it yeah that's not 
[01:16:30]  too long ago and that's fucking scheme of no not at all it makes it a lot easier when you  could take all the little nasty parts out of it you know yeah it makes it a lot easier when you  don't have to acknowledge the the real dirt getting your hands dirty but in front of other people to  do something like where there was uh like you know when a family is being torn apart just to be able to  put put a bullet in the head of a kid that's yelling to shut it up yeah other soldiers see this and i  know the american soldiers in vietnam did some horrible shit there was my lie there was moments of that but i 
[01:17:00]  mean look look at the way that the reaction was fucking horrendous to those moments right yeah americans it  enlarge it and go oh that's okay yeah if we didn't all of a sudden become galvanized and killing  children right can we go to mike in massachusetts mike depends on what mike has to say mike hey hey  what's up guys hey what do you got what's up brother i just think uh you guys are going a little  overboard man painting most germans as murderous i mean maybe no most germans had no idea it was really  going on prior to world war two about no idea now you might be right i mean look i even said 
[01:17:30]  you're totally right well i i want to explore that for a second i mean you didn't get information  as fast as you yeah you do today so what did the average german know i don't think they knew about  what was really going on with the holocaust well and do you know it really knows this i don't know  they didn't have uh was it on the local news twitter oh this guy was on twitter dude we're  taking your fucking point and and and going with it will you shut the fuck up jesus i love the the 
[01:18:00]  the talk over you call guy you actually bring up a good point so now we're like exploring this but  you just kept babbling over everything from what i've seen and read and know it's it seems to me  that uh my a lot of the german a lot of the just the german people were continuing being farmers and  going to work and doing what they do i whether they knew what was going on i know people knew  about rumblings they heard shit they knew people were being rounded up people were being rounded up 
[01:18:30]  exactly they knew something was going on family camps and they knew people weren't coming back  after they were rounded up right so i i even think the innocent people knew they were hiding them  bad how did the info get out of the camps to word of mouth you know even without twitter and  fucking uh uh the internet you know people info did get out uh and then there were those villages  that were around the concentration camps that you know people knew they smelled something yeah right 
[01:19:00]  but they kept their mouths shut and those scenes turn up a lot and you know places like schindler's  list and uh other movies they those scenes turn up with the villagers they fuck with the people that  lived in the villages around the concentration camps that's got to be a weird area yeah it's kind of a  weird a stranger they got to study that are you going to your kid's first birthday party knowing all  the all the hell that's going on a mere mile but they did they did and and they knew and and i think 
[01:19:30]  it was this one was uh portrayed in in band of brothers where they went into the village grabbed  those fucking people and made them clean up the camp oh that's and made them load the bodies into  trucks and everything and they were just horrified these german people i mean and and well to do some some  well-to-do people and just factory workers or whatever had to go in there into the camps  smelling the death and everything and now motherfucker you clean it up because they assumed they had to 
[01:20:00]  know what was going on so yeah just really bugged me just really annoyed me yeah all these  fucking assholes running around today really really you dummy like you think you would have done well  there stupid you fucking idiots you fucking suburban miscreants shut up you mongrel  cunt they would have fucking they would have thrown you right in you wasp yeah stop it 
[01:20:30]  just annoys me i bet the furor would have liked me your fucking high school friends don't even like  you the furor would have liked he wouldn't have liked you you don't think no no no no you're not a  strong figure kyle hitler yeah except for when i have to you know do something real bad yeah i'll  beat up a fag or you know i'll i'll i'll fucking yell jew well and i'm and by the way i'm not 
[01:21:00]  speaking of arians who are in prison where to me that's a necessary survival thing that's different  like when you're in jail believe me i'll tattoo a swastika anywhere they wanted to avoid being raped  by dominicans like there's a difference between that why'd you pick dominicans um because that  would be the worst blacks are too easy it's like we always say blacks dominicans is longer i thought  it'd be a funnier word it worked it worked just want to go into the comedian's head um yeah and 
[01:21:30]  again i'm i'm excluding that because in jail it is a to me a very different survival thing you have  to go into but i'm talking about the people now the bottom line is i don't think anybody who's  popular in high school who's getting a lot of pussy is running out going you know what  fuck the jews yeah you're just not yeah i don't think you have that real passion for it no you just  feel lost what do you guys think you feel like i'm lost and don't really have any people they accept 
[01:22:00]  me changing gears slightly uh the mosque going down uh it's disgusting yeah it's disgusting and  and bloomberg's an idiot he's a cunt what's bloomberg's taking this whole thing in that  it's all about healing and this is the best way that we get to know and live together in peace and  it's a place of peace you know what it is but why it's a place where they meet to make plans to  fuck us but why does it have to be there because it's it's who decided it has to be there they want 
[01:22:30]  it there because they know america's is stupid and we will we will allow you to fuck us in the ass and  then after you wipe the blood off your dick we haven't stood up we're still holding our ankles  waiting for more because we're dumb please more we have to show we have to show the rest of the  world that we are better than that that we can yeah we'll put a mosque right where you completely  fucking destroyed two buildings killed a couple of thousand people uh and we'll put a mosque there so  people can practice that wonderful peaceful religion of islam uh right where uh the religion 
[01:23:00]  itself was used to kill people and this is what annoys me by the way you want to see how lovely islam  is look at those fucking uh those medical team that was just murdered in afghanistan that's wonderful  because they thought they were preaching christianity that's a lovely religion really fast 61 of new  yorkers oppose ground zero mosque that should mean something it means nothing because bloomberg's a  liberal he couldn't win as a democrat so he won as a republican this is the most liberal people  who disagree with you you would think that would be taken for granted but a lot of people think 
[01:23:30]  there's a streak of intolerance in mayor bloomberg that has come out on this mosque issue right at  the same time he's asking for religious tolerance so intolerance how about this this is what  this makes me sick is they're all saying hey this is for um us to show that hey good muslims  suffered too at this and it's a way to not be insensitive and again how about once  why doesn't fuck it why don't muslims think about the insensitivity right of putting this 
[01:24:00]  structure so damn close where all these people were murdered even though it was perverted in the name  of that religion how about some sensitivity for the victims from islam for once yeah we have to be  sensitive but they can do whatever they want because all they do whenever they say it was barbaric  they always find some excuse to how america's foreign policy brought this on ourselves of course  yeah how close to ground zero uh couple blocks i don't know honestly i don't know it's right  a building affected right on top of the uh reflecting pools two blocks away it's probably as close as 
[01:24:30]  they would let them get it yeah why don't they just build two giant mosques it's where the other ones  were why not fuck it go all out it's true it's it's just fucking an abomination unbelievable  yeah i can't stand it and again the the this whole thing don't try to convince me about the peace and  love that is islam yeah i haven't seen it anywhere nope i don't see it the quran itself has shit  written in it that it preaches killing and and and fatwas and fucking murder and and primitive uh uh 
[01:25:00]  treatment of women and and and people well what what how is why respect this religion to the point where  we're making these sacrifices to make them feel good fuck you fuck you and your religion that's  what bothers me is the fact that again like wimpy sissy mentalities like bloomberg and it doesn't mean 
[01:25:30]  i'm not saying fuck all muslims game i'm really not i'm not saying don't build mosques fine bill  i can't say that just but even that i really don't i i understand that most of them are against that  the point is to put it right there is such is such a self-serving thing like we were affected  look what we did it's like i don't care it was done in the name of your religion again by people much  more radical than most muslims but so what don't fucking spit in the victims faces by doing that i 
[01:26:00]  love the fact that these victims families are speaking out and screaming about it um but yeah but  tolerance towards the people uh who are muslim is more important than respecting the uh the the  what that really is to the victims good good move it's ridiculous i i i i i'll never understand  mindset like fucking bloomberg on a subject like and 39 of new yorkers yeah the mindset of 39 of the  new yorkers the liberal it's nice to know that you know more people uh oppose it but september 
[01:26:30]  still you got september 12th i know 2001 i wonder what that fucking percentage would be  if you said well you know what see they're still cleaning up the rubble remember the smoking pile  of fucking rubble uh could you imagine somebody going yeah we want to build a mosque over there  uh let's take a poll how many americans think zero percent say yes and and speaking of no national  pride the fucking buildings haven't been like they're working so slowly because of red tape and 
[01:27:00]  fucking lawyers and corporate oh it's sickening i took a bike ride down there about two weeks ago  i took a picture i put it on twitter i was i was amazed how how nothing is still really 10 years i  mean they're building uh but it is it's unbelievable how how how behind that whole area yeah i i've  watched uh three buildings go up from my window yeah the last two years three huge massive fucking  buildings it has nothing just from my window where i live has nothing to do with no i understand the 
[01:27:30]  ability to build something fast yeah it's the stupid fucking bullshit amazing it goes along with it  absolutely amazing and i've brought up the point many times i just hate the way this country  fucking forgets shit so quickly and it's it's everything it's based on you know you watch the news  something's a big story for a few days and then it's just gone and everyone forgets and then moves  on to the next fucking lindsey lohan story or some bullshit and then you get something like the  feeling that you got on september 11th uh people just forgot it they just forgot and went like 
[01:28:00]  whatever mosque fine man where do you think all that shit was being planned in mosques they all met in  mosques they fucking got together and and discussed how they were going to do things and then they  they don't even respect it themselves we we have to fucking respect the mosque uh in in iraq and  afghanistan god forbid we fucking fire around next to a mosque as everyone we're trying to uh uh 
[01:28:30]  do away with is hiding in them yet they'll run in with a grenade strapped to themselves and kill a  bunch of people right in the mosque they behead other muslims yeah radical muslims behead other muslims  who they think are cooperating or spot whatever whatever they it is yeah so stop with this  the mosque is so sacred horrible fucking group that that this tolerance issue is uh ridiculous you're  not getting any out of me i i think the religion is uh uh archaic has no fucking place in today's 
[01:29:00]  society you want to practice it have fun go back to the shit country it came from and get rocks thrown at  you and have your wife fucking beheaded because she was raped or you know don't practice an archaic  fucking religion here we're past that point okay go back to your cave and fucking uh uh read read  the quran christianity is also crap while we're at it all of them oh believe me no no i'm not i'm not 
[01:29:30]  defending any other religions here and we've we've gone on tears on on the the hypocrisy in christianity too  believe me but right now i'm talking about these savages i've had it i've had it i've had it with  people saying it's a peaceful religion the peaceful muslim people uh are outraged that where where are  they how can you be peaceful when there's that much shit written in your fucking your your handbook on 
[01:30:00]  killing people there are peaceful they always say look that was terrible what happened but there's  always but but america's foreign policy but america has to realize but america should have known but  it's always a but it's never there are despicable people in this religion who have perverted it like  i would if they were really if they treated their suicide bombers and people like that the way christians  react to to abortion clinic bombers i would find it much easier to be sympathetic this is great the 
[01:30:30]  punishment of those who wage war against allah and his messenger and strive with might and main for  mischief through the land is here's some of the punishment execution or crucifixion or the cutting  off of hands and feet from opposite sides oh that's interesting so you're a little wobbly uh exile from the land  um and how about us to the thief male or female cut off his or her hands punishment by way of example 
[01:31:00]  that it all that is to me is just religious right that could easily be in the bible it could easily be  in the bible i know it meaning that it's just that's just the way they looked at shit back then but you  know what the bible has some violence in it yeah i know no i understand but you know what it's really  aside from your run-of-the-mill abortion clinic bomber um it's really not practiced yeah like it is  with uh islam and and quotes from the quran they still practice this shit oh there's plenty of radical 
[01:31:30]  crazy bible stuff with cutting off hands and ripping out tongues and gouging out eyeballs and and all that  stuff but you know if uh thine eyes deceive you do you pluck them out um i say probably not oh  all right let's get some funny shit on the radio that is funny that was that was a fun oh the 
[01:32:00]  fucking i feel no pressure to amuse these shitheads no none them all  uh very good discussion actually and we'll do some other things right thanks thanks  you know we got to get into the sauna story the sauna championships did you even know there was  a sauna i was signed up i've been invited to it really to do comedy during the finals in finland  finland stupid finland what the hell goes on there coldness 
[01:32:30]  they did lalapalooza over the weekend sorry yes they did sorry about that sorry no that's fine 
[01:33:00]  yeah yeah green day uh lady gaga uh sound garden lady gaga the gaga lady gaga doing uh  uh lalapalooza yep i want to see sound garden badly lalapalooza  um this weekend uh anthony one congratulations raccoons zero  oh you caught a raccoon caught me a raccoon i gotta make believe i didn't see the picture 
[01:33:30]  yeah i know the picture was amazing he set up the raccoon traps in his backyard and guess what he got  one there look at the little guy oh isn't he adorable you put your finger through and go like  on his chin no let me tell you what i did i i went close with the camera um to try to uh get a close  picture of him and he he scared me did he because he made a funny funny sound but wasn't he in the 
[01:34:00]  cage uh yeah but it still scared you dude it scared me 20 times each time i tried to get close to the uh  do you video yeah okay here's some sound from him let me see if i could look at the cube rack  phone look how cute he is watch this  what's going to sound  hi 
[01:34:30]  he went right  i pulled back so fast i was like even though he's in a cage right and then there's the shot that  makes peter mad is peter on your case a couple of people actually were a couple people thought i  was actually going to pull the trigger really he's gonna pull a fucking the trigger on a 50 cal  that's uh literally six to eight inches away from a raccoon's face away from his little face  the funny thing is he's looking directly into the barrel it would be so funny though if that cage 
[01:35:00]  door just opened up how fast you would run i know how worthless that gun would be  it'd just be a stick running it'd be a stick for him to run on and get to your eyes faster  dude that's a pretty good sized raccoon yeah yeah he was a big guy he's cute though  they're adorable they got little masks on like a little criminal stop stealing things guys no stop  he must have uh when i saw him the next day because he must have been caught overnight um the cage is 
[01:35:30]  spun around 180 degrees from where it was so he must have been losing his  fucking mind in there for a while by this point he was plum tuckered out because uh when i saw him  he was laying down kind of in a little circle with his little hand over his eyes like oh god you got  me he was all bumming so what finally happened from there um you have him in a cage now where do you  release him uh in uh the next door neighbor's basement it's just for shenanigans uh the exterminator 
[01:36:00]  comes and drives him to some happy place very far away doesn't yes they do it's a happy place  raccoon place very far away do they kill them what do you think you think the exterminator's really  you know spending an afternoon to do the right thing they took mr jangle down to the the raccoon  circus down there in florida where and if you're an exterminator i bet you there's a lot of laws  you have to follow that you can't just be letting that's just raccoons you catch loose somewhere else 
[01:36:30]  on long island in the woods that thing is dead here's the only reason i think he's an upstanding  guy and pays attention to the laws well you're not allowed to kill him did you ask him no i don't  want to know what's going to happen this fucking thing he's dead he's cute the raccoon but here's  the reason why easier that way they they've they've gotten into my attic at some point right  he he didn't put the traps in the attic because then the raccoon can go in get stuck in the trap  and the attic gets 130 degrees and the raccoon dies so he and then your house stinks he doesn't 
[01:37:00]  want to go up there and get it out of a stinky house well not the next day it's not gonna stink  the next day but he'd be dead so he takes him to the happy raccoon release grounds very far  away in the country yeah i wonder if there's a place in the woods where they do take him where  they just they're not going to get back to people why would they do that because they might have to  buy law if they have to buy law you're not going to lose your business over like it might be a thing  they have to do all i hope no one's looking what do you think the guy did with the raccoon i hope  he dropped him off i hope drop the expressway south of the fucking uh uh parkway problem and south 
[01:37:30]  of a lot of other roads where he would get squished trying to get back to my house i think we have  a pretty big radio show come on exterminators tell me what happens to the raccoons we're gonna hear  a bunch of stories tell me about the raccoons and where you that where you take them i don't  here it is i don't think there's anywhere you could take them on long island legally  here's what happens i was an exterminator and my whole family exterminates and we're exterminators  uh take the trap there's a 55 gallon drum full of water behind our fucking shop and we just lower 
[01:38:00]  the trap in there and wait you know five ten minutes lift it up and that's it he's gone  we put him in a ditch and bury him couldn't be helped couldn't be helped i think your raccoon is  dead and it's over and that's that yeah frank in new york what does the word exterminate mean  relocate no they relocated the little guy i called a relocator oh sweet he's so cute i don't 
[01:38:30]  want anything bad to have happened to him i know you you could see like a hollywood star playing his  voice yeah i know look at his little eyes he's got the little mask on oh my god let me uh let me go  oh look at him you really think that raccoon is still alive yes he's fine he was not happy to see  you no where on long island do they take the raccoons um they take them out to the pine barrens i got  people nashville isn't gonna help me uh chris chris in nashville go ahead 
[01:39:00]  yeah um we had a service come get some raccoons off of our farm and they quote unquote relocated  them about two weeks later we found because my wife said uh uh she loves animals two weeks later  we find out they relocated them to a dog training facility to be used to train coon dogs to hunt  that's where the raccoons go at well that's down there there's not much coon hunting going on here  you're personally responsible for the death of a raccoon no hope you feel good about yourself 
[01:39:30]  a guy that loses his mind mind when he sees little kittens on tv he i know i do and you  tell me you're not losing your mind over the cute raccoon i was sitting on the stoop there uh uh  next to the cage just talking to him until the exterminator got there nice i was like hi little  guy nice buzz i was jesus well i had a couple of beers but i was talking to him it was fun i was like  don't worry did you feed him okay little guy you feed him little treats no i wasn't getting near him  because he made that sound that's what he would have done if you gave him a little treat to eat 
[01:40:00]  he would fucking bite my fingers and i'd have rabies no if you just slipped into the cage i don't  mean oh you ever get well there are little treats in there for them they're little marshmallows  that's the bait they like marshmallows and peanut butter and then like some big  meaty bone was in there and look at your rock didn't get caught in there  it comes out he rocks it by track just his little fat head  yeah that's funny that the noise it made though yeah it barked it did that like three times and 
[01:40:30]  every time i pulled away like a fairy i got way too close to a uh raccoon a rat once you should hear  what a rat could sound like when it feels like it's trapped yeah like these animals make these weird  noises fuck out of you yeah they come up with these noises that you just you think they're silent  animals and they're barking at you uh you know what i want to know where the raccoons go on long  island because we all know long island there's not many spots left where you could just release  raccoons that way out east the pine barrens so you think your guy is gonna is gonna waste a half a 
[01:41:00]  day of work to bring raccoons into maybe he's got a bunch of raccoons from a bunch of other houses  and he he takes them out there and and goes okay and what do you think bye bye i'm playing this  perfectly but what really what do you think happens to these poor things i honestly think  they release you want you want an honest honest uh yes sir i don't know i just don't know and ask  him but i i but he said he releases him like i i already asked but where does he release them i  didn't ask but i guess i'll ask and if he's releasing the raccoons in the same area there's 
[01:41:30]  gonna be a lot of raccoons in this one area hopefully you're making a lot more fucking raccoons  my front yard so you have something to do next we can come back and re-catch it you should have  read the fine print we catch the raccoon and release it in your front yard or in your toilet  so he bites out your asshole and balls and he calls his brother the doctor is this uh is this  an angry raccoon getting released for free yeah  are there's a raccoon being released yes okay he's gonna just open the cage oh 
[01:42:00]  fuck what's gonna happen 30 000 views something happens you think oh yeah they're opening up the  little raccoon trap all right he's ready to come on this looks a lot like your raccoon yeah he does  wait a minute maybe it's mine dump him out what the fuck was that  what the hell was that raccoon still in the cage 
[01:42:30]  go homie go  come on back up dumb animal no turn around asshole tip it up  oh my god he's all mad they make piggy noises  oh there he goes he just ran off he was a little angry at first he ran into a tree he's  climbing a tree he's gonna sit there and duke it out no it's a fucking raccoon so i don't know what 
[01:43:00]  happens to him but uh i i assume he takes him somewhere and lets him go to live out his little  raccoon life you don't even want to know where the raccoons go why phone calls are brutal are they yes  i don't like the thing this guy used to be an exterminator i knew that in pennsylvania ed how's  it going hey uh yeah i used to trap raccoons and all that other fun every other animal and what we  used to do was uh we trap them and people ask we say oh yeah we let them free and by uh state wall 
[01:43:30]  here in pennsylvania they have to be put down because you can't put say that raccoon had rabies now you're  transporting the rabies virus to a different part of your uh state or county so we used to have a co2  canister that we used to have to put them in and then we'd turn it on nice and slow and they would  just freeze and uh we'd remove them from there after we you know out of the trap that's pretty much 
[01:44:00]  what yeah i don't you freeze them with co2 yeah because we used to have a 55 gallon drum with the  water but uh the humane services said that was uh it was inhumane to put them in to dunk them  so we had to uh go to a little gas chamber for so aunt's little raccoon is now dead right yeah  pretty much he's pretty much uh oh and oh and how do you live with yourself i don't want to i just wanted  some marshmallows how do you live with yourself little fellow wanted a marshmallow i was chatting  with him you know you probably thought you'd be okay if if your exterminator was a smart guy i know 
[01:44:30]  where you were joking about putting in your front yard but i would release it in the neighborhood  a few houses down you know how much repeat business you would get in the neighborhood  all for the same fucking raccoon i never thought about that knowing like neighbors in general talks  also like i fucking got a raccoon really well i called this guy yeah call this guy i got a number  it's the same raccoon just it's his pet right he like knows where to tell it to go to certain 
[01:45:00]  places just keeps dumping it two houses down two houses down brilliant hey wait can we danny has  angry raccoon of vicious i want to hear is he can you hear it yeah it just oranges it does make like  these piggy sounds it's very strange yes hello you want these dvds  guys trying to feed on something on a sticks of meat oh jesus can you imagine wow

[01:46:00]  fucking a serrated knife you would that thing would just lay right into that would hurt so much  oh you know how infected it would get even if it doesn't have rabies it would get so  fucking infected look at that i think raccoon teeth are dirty oh they're filthy just eating  rotting garbage all day licking his raccoon balls yeah dirty raccoon asshole has raccoon  shit in it oh it's just garbage coming out of his ass caked caked with raccoon duty i would hate to

[01:49:30]  what the fuck is a sauna like what's the i don't even know what are the rules uh news does a wacky  light-hearted poorly read story about how the sauna championships are coming  yeah all right let's see what this is about finland is hosting the 11th annual sauna bathing  world championship sounds relaxing right well that's where you're wrong contestants say  and see how long they can stay in a scalding hot sauna and we mean 230 degrees fahrenheit 
[01:50:00]  nothing relaxing about that that look says it all that's got to be seriously we've done some dumb  things late at night but that's got to be one of the dumbest things i've ever seen  either that or how about the hot dog eating contest the more the more that you eat yeah yeah  i'll take the sauna exactly i don't know what this horse talking about  what is she doing a hot dog eating no that's not even close to being in 240 degrees 
[01:50:30]  what a dunce and who thought that would be a good idea to have a sauna championship  imagine trying to do that on the radio you think you think they'll let us do that one  i don't think so no so then uh well that was the setup and then i think  a responsible news organization did this story police in finland are investigating the death of  a contestant during an event in which contenders compete to see who can stay the longest in a  blazing hot sauna a russian competitor of the sauna world championships died while his finnish rival 
[01:51:00]  was rushed to a hospital both men collapsed after the sauna reached 110 degrees celsius 110  paramedics tried to help the men both suffered severe burns and were bleeding from open sores  organizers maintain all the rules were followed each contestant had submitted a medical certificate  before competing oh okay oh well that's it medical certificate for taking a bullet in the head  contest right well you know they signed a medical they were in good health i don't know what 
[01:51:30]  happened after someone dies in your championship you can't still try to defend it yeah yeah we had  they're bleeding from open sores that were caused because they were in there too long  i don't think a healthy uh body has anything to do with this starting the competition that's  ridiculous hot like that's crazy should never be in that kind of heat hot what a dumb how long  are they in there i don't know what a dumb contest 110's got to be 230 it is 220 or something like 
[01:52:00]  that yeah it's right 220 i saw it's in the 200 230 is it there's degrees fahrenheit wow what is a  regular sauna how many 115 120 60 degrees oh i thought it was warmer there you go wait a regular sauna  doesn't get up to 220 230 degrees the one i go into i want to say is 118 119 live steam is like  fucking 210 yeah it's got to be higher than that jimmy i think  or what do they do just keep making it hotter and hotter until these fucking guys maybe that's it 
[01:52:30]  get out slowly bring the temperature up until you don't realize you're fucking sitting there in in  a life-threatening situation how do you get the open wounds oh they're just splitting open oh you  think your fucking arms are just splitting open like hot dogs yeah of course let me uh go to tim he  read a book on this you read a book on us on the sauna championship my prediction is that tim is not  going to have anything tim i'm with you buddy there you go i know there you go i i have confidence in 
[01:53:00]  tim let's go all right come on tim come on i hope i'm wrong hey there's there's a uh he writes articles  for espn.com his name is rick riley uh he wrote a book on stupid sports and uh one of the one of the  chapters was on the sauna championships uh he went he didn't compete but uh he was interviewing a bunch of  the competitors uh he interviewed this one guy and in his first heat he was in there and he was  breathing through his nose and it's so damn hot it melted the skin off his upper lip he was getting  uh huge blisters on his back and shoulders stuff like that uh you you have to sit up in an upright 
[01:53:30]  position you can't lean too forward or they'll give you a warning after your first warning the  second time you're out you can't rub the sweat off you have to stay in a very still position and  these guys just go in there and see how long they can last in in in this boiling temperature  it's ridiculous it's just crazy how uh how long these guys stay in there that's um  no they get out of these saunas and they go back and they just take these ice baths 
[01:54:00]  and these cold water showers to try to get their bodies back down to a normal temperature before you  know guys pass out and collapse uh and the year that uh rick riley wrote this book uh the woman's  champion both the ladies had to go to the hospital afterwards hey is there any pictures of these guys  leaving the competition from maybe past years i want to see what they look like he has he has a picture  of the one guy in his book but there's no yeah that's not a whole bunch of pictures in his book i 
[01:54:30]  don't know if he'd be able to dig some up yeah yeah i want to see what some of these guys look like  after they get out of the sauna how what kind of shape they're in you think they look a little red  oh yeah he's saying it's open it's open blisters the guy that uh had the skin melted off his lip  went to the hospital because of the sores and he he actually won uh took second in his heat and he  actually came back from the hospital and tried to compete in the in the final it's not competing no  that's not a competition it's no competition it's just sitting it's just stupidity i can be hot longer 
[01:55:00]  than you yeah right greg a dead guy would win that yeah greg bach from pa writes human skin fails at  something like 150 degrees your skin starts kind of failing really why i don't know i think uh 150 is  up there and yeah but i i think saunas are like 150 i don't know like regular saunas  jimmy doesn't think so how hot is a regular sauna  160 194 yeah steam so that's like a finished sauna so i guess that's some other kind but i guess 
[01:55:30]  a standard sauna would be a steam sauna okay and that goes anywhere from 90 to 120 yeah that's  what jimmy was saying 118 is is his so that's about right wow so maybe 150 is where the skin starts to  fail fail your skin is i don't think you want your skin to fail you don't want your skin failing  they were only in the sauna for six minutes when they had to pull this guy out so they're not even  in there that long no they said his suit was covered in sweat because you have to wear a suit and a tie 
[01:56:00]  and derby dailymail.com bottom of page for the sauna picks  and he just put up the melting guy's face from uh raiders of the lost that's skin failing  yeah skin that's a bit of skin failing your skin hits failing  all right sir thanks for the yes so we got that going on today 
[01:56:30]  all right he actually uh had a little info i'll give it to him yeah i think you did all right  very rare i want to see the pictures dailymail.com i think it's on the bottom  what what what what dailymail.com oh yeah uh yeah daily daily mail and everything else on there  is bullshit because it's english no no daily mail it's a stupid fucking no fake newspaper no  it's the christian daily mail borderline third degree burns they get in this competition really 
[01:57:00]  getting a lot of info i guess a lot of people know about this shit oh that's the charleston daily mail  uh uh yeah i got a dot com over here  nah i think i'll be there why not i don't know i just never believe anybody  i'm very skeptical skeptical skeptical skeptical skeptical and cynical lull when it comes to this  stuff oh why was a 16 year old pregnant girl stabbed in the head at dominican day parade in midtown 
[01:57:30]  you you answered your own question without meaning to wasn't even gonna gonna touch that one well  she's probably yeah and why is obama playing basketball with lebron james and other nba stars  figured i would go for a second one answer all your own questions oh there they are  uh there's the two guys whatever con contestant dies in searing 225 degree heat at world sauna

[02:26:30]  i don't know depends on the girl some girls yeah i've seen girls who look better with your hair i don't  even know why like kanye west is his woman amber rose she's she's hot but she's bald like she's banging  but don't you want a little hair she's totally bald yeah pretty much got like a yeah little buzz cut  or whatever she's pretty that's fucked up yeah let me see let's say click

[02:27:30]  could put like four fingers in all the way up to like where the ridge of the finger is where it meets  the palm yeah jesus you're actually doing it like like you check for if your tires are bald  with a fucking nickel but to me white sexy man white girls don't have asses like some do i'm  telling you i've got some nice deep cracks yeah i like a good deep crevasse what is she by the way  uh ethnically uh i'm not sure black something 50 50 well where it counts a little combo  where she's that one down where she's walking daily dose right there left one one more left she's a 
[02:28:00]  pretty girl man fuck yeah wow i am i ain't feeling that body on her yeah but the hair i don't know  i can't explain i don't have an answer for you she's a good fuck it's like the emma watson hair looks  too like boyish i guess i guess when it looks boyish nothing wrong with that i don't mind yeah sure  some of those don't look good long hair now what's her name there where she cut her hair off danny's  just been in hot bald girls porn clip of some guy coming all over her shaved head on a shaved 
[02:28:30]  that looks funny it looks like a harry krishna yeah she's vomiting from chemo and someone's jerking  off on her gotta love that when demi moore uh shaved it off no she looks sexy i mean she's  no hair is always better oh longer hair or you don't care it could it be real short it  no well then why are you asking me why because i was just wondering no some short hair could be  good i guess if you but as long as it's only on young girls old old women when they start with 
[02:29:00]  that short hair thing just because it's easier i think when i think if it's shorter than your own  hair you know what i mean yeah you don't want that it depends on her grab onto a little bit  dude some girls look really good with short hair and then if they had long hair they wouldn't look as  good yeah and some girls with short hair are atrocious like it just depends on the face it's  like guys some guys can pull off long hair other guys like yeah now who who the fuck is that down 
[02:29:30]  at the bottom of the page yeah all right winona ryder always known for her little pixie cut  she wore it well i think  yeah emma watson i don't know new look gonna be hard to um wow how 80s is that she's got the spiky  short hair and the come on eileen why not a vocalist coveralls  fuck man she was goddamn hot wasn't she what is she doing is she still acting probably  fucking rock star still that's what she became known for oh really just fucking everything in 
[02:30:00]  the 90s everybody that fucking played anything in the 90s she was having sex with oh god everyone  everybody there were so many okay why don't we do the uh the wycliffe wycliffe and sean pan  apparently sean pan's got a problem with white so why doesn't sean pan try to become the president  of haiti if he cares so much sean pan is worried about wycliffe being opportunistic oh unlike him with 
[02:30:30]  the shotgun in louisiana yeah the last thing in the world haiti needs and i'm not accusing  wycliffe john of being an opportunist i don't know the man but i think it's extremely important  that we pay great attention to both the individuals in the united states who are enamored with him  maybe not for his uh political strengths and in particular for corporate interests that are in  enamored enamored with him and those that may themselves be opportunists on the back of the  haitian people right now i worry that this is a campaign that excuse me could you pause that for one 
[02:31:00]  second and because people like know who wycliffe is which again uh-huh as opposed to why we're all  listening to you right now yeah you asshole like the same reason you get to hang out with hugo chavez  who is a cunt see but what wycliffe is saying is this is messed up and unless we get a president  down there that knows what he's doing then we'll just be bogus too hey you think he hates that he made 
[02:31:30]  that movie oh yes when you listen to it he's just pompous rambling like this you know it's just like  everyone's going hey what's picoli i hear he doesn't even want to acknowledge he ever made that movie  oh fuck him he's been a real twat about that movie ever since no clean water no infrastructure no service  that's the name they gave me hey bud let's party why don't you get a job picoli what for you need  money oh i need some tasty waves cool buzz and i'm fine i'm so wasted why do you shamelessly waste my 
[02:32:00]  time on this hey can you hear the sound of the stereo oh no do you have a guy like me in class every  year you know a guy who you make an example of you'll find out next year you dick you worked at all 
[02:32:30]  american burgers  my brother's gonna make up your mind dude is he gonna shit or is he gonna kill us  my brother's gonna shit then he's gonna kill us oh no what is this stuff 
[02:33:00]  doesn't that stuff like brain damage i'll leave the cake like every day for a month  white white guy with the gun even back then yeah exactly  all right all right all right all right i got a little fuck man one of the greatest movie  characters ever he just turns out to be a douche and he just won't acknowledge and he doesn't want 
[02:33:30]  to acknowledge it yeah if you can find some info on that he doesn't they do reunions and this and  that and he doesn't want to be part of any of it just learn about haiti eating some food but didn't  picoli allowed him to do so much more in hollywood without that big hit that was it the next  one was bad boys the one with the jail right we would be listening to sean penn on cnn today  everything after that was like a traumatic role right yeah of the haitian people right now 
[02:34:00]  i worry that this is a campaign that um is more about a vision of flying around the world  talking to people i haven't seen or heard anything of him in these last six months that  i've been in haiti you worked on the fugees  everything he said was basically that's not okay and then what we got some why cleft now no no no  that's another guy who's against why cleft his former band member proz 
[02:34:30]  proz has a problem with him has also decided yes what's the beef well i think the beef is mainly  that the fugees were lorne hill who went on to be extremely successful in her solo career  why cleft who went on to be extremely successful in his solo career and then there was proz who had  ghetto superstar proz what he what the song ghetto superstar from the movie bulwarth that was  proz's last hit he's like the chris novoselic right who's that exactly exactly  the one that didn't move on after the death of yeah yeah is he still rich you think oh yeah i'm sure 
[02:35:00]  sure he does politics in washington oh really there's another one yeah he's he's a politician  i would just if i was running against him i would just play the clip of him throwing his base up in  the air and hit his head over and over again over and over and go is this the guy you want well let's  listen wow he does oh my god look at him damn what the fuck jeez kurt did the right thing yeah  blowing his brains out kurt's a legend this guy's just an old fucking dick asshole now he's a dick 
[02:35:30]  he had like one band after nirvana and they released one album and that was it he's probably  a nice guy i don't know he always came off as such an asshole really wow was he pulling like a comb  over back in the 90s oh yeah yeah yeah he started was he early sure like find a 90s picture yeah he  kind of like uh he's doing some some swimming playing that was the guy in nirvana he did a little  swooping yeah it was swooping let's see if he's swooping it's uh it's a little wispy you know 
[02:36:00]  little wispy in the front but wow god that shit was a long time ago all right let's not think about  it damn depressing for everybody yeah there's a swoop thing going on swoop going yeah dave girl  he invented the justin bieber back in 94 he had the bieber going did the bieber i love when i see guys  who are like in their early 20s 
[02:36:30]  waiting for your next word all right here's a prize no guys with their early 20s with the hair come  forward and you know that they're fighting premature baldness it's so awful you just know  that new style so you don't know what right you know what they're doing with that  everything he said was basically just broad strokes general you know plans or general ideas 
[02:37:00]  that he had i didn't get a sense like this is someone that's going to really take haiti  and really take it to the 21st century oh really a bit easier for me to just say  i support wyclef you know but i just don't support his policies i don't see anything for me it's not  about me it's not about wyclef it's not about a sense of entitlement it's about the people because  at the end of the day wyclef get on his private jet flies back to the state prize get on his  commercial flight flies back to the state and we go to our homes but the people still gotta live in 
[02:37:30]  it pause right there could you i'm sorry yeah could you rewind the last  30 seconds of that and you could see the whole clip was 30 seconds no the last okay the last 10  seconds you can hear the bitterness yeah when he talks about the travel arrangements get on his  private jet flies back to the state prize get on his commercial flight flies back to the state  uh watch get on his private jet fly back pros get on his commercial flight i got on coach i  made a couple of stops and shit so it has nothing to do with his politics you just don't like the guy 
[02:38:00]  and how about uh someone to bring fucking haiti into the 18th century first how about you start slow  slow down a little bit oh my god it's like playing civilizations you can't go right to the  fucking 21st century one century at a time yeah kind of jump ahead slow down too quickly you bring  up the uh chris novoselic ad you wanted him to do yeah reminded me have you seen the new latest  anti-linda mcmahon ad no oh it rules somebody literally just looped all the mcmahon kicking jr in 
[02:38:30]  the balls it just it's going it just plays over and over linda kicks jr in the nuts linda kicks jr in  the nuts i hate politics but i'm fascinated by this linda mcmahon attempting to get this done  she's gonna do it i know but why would you and they're finally using all the wrestling against  her it's like it's like arnold schwarzenegger running for governor and having the competition  take some of his movies and say oh do you want this guy it's like it was playing a role it's  weird like that the way that it looks it plays worse though when it's wrestling because it's linda 
[02:39:00]  mcmahon being linda mcmahon for years yeah mcmahon contributed thousands of dollars to national  democrats mcmahon attended the democrat national convention mcmahon supports taxpayer finance  government bailouts that's right just like dot and blumenfall linda mcmahon will be another vote  for obama's taxpayer-funded bailouts mcmahon supporting obama's bailouts isn't that just a kick  in the they just keep showing her kicking jr in the balls and they're calling her liberal mcmahon 
[02:39:30]  yeah yeah is she a democrat no she's republican that's why they're taking shots she doesn't  represent the republic but her she's just been gaining popularity like crazy over there yeah yeah  yeah she's gonna do it she's probably gonna head in the polls uh not yet but it was like she used to  be behind the other guy by like 40 percent now she's only 10 percent behind he's got 50 and she's  got 40 when is vince gonna help her out do a commercial for his uh for his wife my dad sent me an 
[02:40:00]  an article that was in one of the papers this weekend that vince uh was upset because the people  running against her kept using stuff out of context like wrestlers uh pretending to have sex with dead  bodies and vince is upset and vince doesn't understand he said they've never seen a full show or been to a  live event they shouldn't be using the necrophilia out of context we have people having sex with dead  bodies it's in context is it really i think linda mcmahon wants vince to just keep his yap shut for a little 
[02:40:30]  longer he can totally ruin this for her i mean the dammit the worst stuff is the stuff of when  she was doing her gimmick where she was confined to a wheelchair in a vegetative state and vince  just started tongue kissing the divas while she was sitting right in front of him you think they'll  use that in a commercial an anti linda mcmahon commercial sits by while things around like yeah  they'll do something about how yeah yeah why don't they just have a scroll of all the wrestlers that  have died before the age of 40. wow i mean that's all you know heart attacks things like that that 
[02:41:00]  stuff happens oh she's uh she's getting close 40 percent to his 53 percent it's for the republican  primary all right yeah i got a tinkle yeah you want to do that daddy has to tinkle sweet boy has to  tinkle sweet boy oh yeah i was just reading that whole wycliffe thing do you care if he becomes  president in it why do i give a shit about haiti i mean honestly i'm not i'm talking about the people 
[02:41:30]  fucking dying in the earthquake i mean just in general why would i care about the haitian president  any more than i do a president of some other fucking third world nation well they're talking about how like  the kids are going to be affected like uh the power because his policies apparently are more  corporate friendly and it's like i love these well then maybe that might be fucking good for haiti  but i'm just saying that's they're saying it's like and i love these kids 
[02:42:00]  oh jesus i just made that up at my white club i hadn't heard any of that  no just wanted to say i love these kids just because it's summer you shouldn't be allowed to wear a  sundress yeah oh jesus christ that's i'm as big as the sundress jesus she was kind of  gripping fat person oh my god she's have diamonds cut out of her back i just saw the biggest sundress  walk by yeah oh in here oh yeah oh my god that was fatty i wonder how mad she'd get if i opened the 
[02:42:30]  door and yelled hey fatty i want to talk to you fatty how come fat is like you could have fatty or fatso  i love fatso because fat's the important part because it really is fat so it's so fat but  reversed hey so fat when i see fat people in sundresses i actually want to just pull her back  i want to take pliers and grab her fat back and guide her backwards oh that would hurt yes it would  but it would be effective she'd come yes fatty fat women in dresses 
[02:43:00]  very good daddy that's that's great oh look at this why do they bother  why do they bother listen uh puddle of aids aunt how bad does it suck for sam's dad  in order to relate to his son he has to clip out articles about wrestling and chicken mcnuggets  while gulping buttermilk the tastiest of all treats buttermilk is rough i ain't drinking that  shit all right break time sure i gotta take let's remind people that ving rames will be on the show

[03:01:30]  man's man all right how do you do that all right walk us through it well i'll skip the opening part  it's like not so sure what a man's man what a man's man movie is all about a man's man doesn't get  irritating reading that a lot a man's man movie is packed with little action guns heist humor car  chases and explosions and a little tna never hurts a guy just channel surfs and watches whatever the 
[03:02:00]  late night movie is but a man's man has at his fingertips an arsenal of dvds fully locked and  loaded that would make even clint eastwood smile when a man's man gets together with his pals or even  when he's home relaxing yeah he sits down to a movie that is guaranteed to have more testosterone  than a gold gym 
[03:02:30]  i'm going to step out on a ledge and guess that that's a lot of testosterone  and i'm going to guarantee that it must be a man's man movie yeah if even clint eastwood  is smiling smiling smiling can you have all the dramatic things clint eastwood knew he's smiling  is there is there any way to get a refund  have you ever deleted a book from the library not yet 
[03:03:00]  this chapter is about goodfellas not goodbye girl  bonnie and clyde not thelman louise pale rider not whale rider  rocky not roxanne and bulldoorm not beaches  it helps there's more examples  i i'm getting chills are you starting to catch my dvd drift good hey a man's man cannot live on  hallie berry alone he has a big appetite for film so here's the winning recipe 
[03:03:30]  oh here we go all right you sprinkle a little clint eastwood with a splash of steve mcqueen  and a dash of burt reynolds and you got yourself a feast of man's man films for the ages  so i guess because that was like a cooking thing  the sprash and the splash and the dink the sprinkle and the dash and the  spash and the dinkle and the dinkle and the yeah 
[03:04:00]  oh my god jesus jimmy he's a friend of the show  i actually remember yeah anything else no no i just  oh god that's fantastic though oh could you do the music one  oh yeah let me get let me get to the get the music yeah yeah yeah let me go to the table of  contents a man's man selena gomez jesus she's  fucking hot look at those eyes very smoky listening to music like a man's man 
[03:04:30]  i bet you have an old picture of frank  of course frank that overrated boar  you don't like frank sinatra no i don't like frank sinatra no i don't that's sacrilege  hey what's the matter with you he's very what's the matter you  frank sinatra was overrated did you just say that yes and i would say that to anybody except  nancy sinatra who was better than frank sinatra i don't i don't know i don't know who i don't  know who was a better crooner than bobby darren maybe i don't know crooner i would go perry 
[03:05:00]  colmo he had a very good voice sinatra terrible i don't know about perry colmo perry colmo he had  he had a smooth voice oh no oh here you go yeah the music one this is the second chapter he goes when  you uh when you think of a man's man singer who comes to mind frank sinatra ray charles tony bennett  if you brought up any one of these performers i had to put a moulin yarn in there yeah i had to  throw a nigger in the mix even though i didn't want to because a man's man doesn't mix the races 
[03:05:30]  if you thought any of these performers you're definitely warm kid  but to help you better understand music my way  ah my way here's a list of man's man singers and singers i'm not so sure about man's man  singer frank sinatra do we have to explain why ah not so sure michael jackson do we have to explain 
[03:06:00]  why what well you're writing a book so maybe yeah when you look at obviously how about you explain  man's man singer elvis presley rumor has it he had to put a restraining order out against female fans  how about you mentioned when he was eating fried  banana and peanut butter sandwiches and died with a fucking shit tail sticking out 
[03:06:30]  how about that's what a man's man does he gets so bloated and fucks so many girls he dies with a  shit tail you know he was grunting to try to get that thing out a man's man he died with his face  on a bath mat and a shit tail sticking out with his white ill-fitting slacks around his knees  tile marks on the side of his face while his beautiful wife fucked the karate instructor  a moulin yon that's a man's man for you oh here you go marilyn not so sure marilyn manson 
[03:07:00]  rumor has it the devil put out a restraining order against him  how stupid would the devil look uh walking into a police station with his hooves and having that  fucking fat black lady tell him to get in line it's always a fat black lady at the police station  he's feeling very threatened and wants a restraining order here's man's man singer  yeah yeah tony bennett his music career spanned six decades oh 
[03:07:30]  so not so sure vanilla ice his music career spanned six weeks  oh why bring it up because he's trying but tony bennett and vanilla ice that's a little  that's a stretch oh there's a couple more these are funny man's man singer jerry lee lewis he  performs like a pit bull without a leash not so sure boy george he performs like a portal in a biker outfit 
[03:08:00]  look i think i hate him now okay i'm actually making buck teeth faces why  boy george was he going i know this book is a couple of years old but  fuck yeah it's not 30 years old hey don't make fun of frank vincent  eh top man's man all right with man's man's man it's the theme of the book jimmy 
[03:08:30]  it's a god man's guys guy man guide after a while does he just put mm i should have he should just  put a you know a top you know who's guide yeah  yeah let's see the top man's music legends  uh  go ahead is dean martin in there sinatra again with sinatra 
[03:09:00]  he does someone the chairman of the board and leader of the legendary rat pack  was undoubtedly the ultimate man's man entertainer sure loyal to his friends devoted to his family  oh really and involved with his music right to the end of his life god bless  and now here's my speech from jungle fever exactly he never yelled my daughter's  fucking a nigger out the window in front of the whole neighborhood no i did 
[03:09:30]  that's a man's man's guide to your daughter going out and doing what she shouldn't do yeah  while he was singing autumn of my years i was screaming at annabella scoria whose last name i cannot  say  i do love frank vincent too but of course he's fantastic sounds it this is a good toilet reading  book it's like one of those things you just read in the bowl and you know it's not but i'm saying 
[03:10:00]  that's what it's better making movies a man's guide to shitting shouldn't be yeah that guy's  guide this is like george wentz beer book no it's better than that this is better than  george wentz depressing beer oh no one of these days excess i like the way he ties okay one of these  days when we have a really slow show we got to just go over the george wentz interview for anthony  yeah the awkward george wentz interview i want to get your take on it one day  very uncomfortable one of these days i've heard pieces of it it's just 
[03:10:30]  a little much jimmy's trying to call him out on his alcoholism i try i but it wasn't even to be a  jerk it was just because he was he came in with that mopey energy it was like what are you promoting  this stupid talk are you obsessed with the george wentz interview i honestly haven't thought about  it but i mean if i'm obsessed with how weird that day was yeah me and jimmy and george went george  went george wentz either really depressed or really hung over we couldn't figure it out hopefully  george wentz to an a.a meeting 
[03:11:00]  there's a d in there i think tony ties these things in oh sorry frank does yes tony bennett he may have  left his heart in san francisco but this man's man entertainer is still right here what i don't know  i bet you it sold a shitload too you know what of course it did i bet you it sold a lot of copies  louis armstrong it's like a man's man no one is you know why is he a man's man exactly if you're 
[03:11:30]  getting blown right now you're listening to t.i nobody's listening to fucking louis armstrong  getting blown mc jagger fine james brown is dead bono who cares about him springsteen's fine  depressing steven tyler he does fucking ballads now gene crupa no one's talking about gene crupa  gene crupa can we uh hear some gene crupa he's fantastic gene crupa jerry lee lewis right with  him what he's a guy's guy to fucking a man's niece jesus christ oh jerry lee lewis 
[03:12:00]  yeah i can think of jerry lewis jerry lee lewis  uh-oh man's man honorable music mentions yes don't get anything written about  billy joel mozart joe perry bobby darren duke ellington steven van zant  frankie valley count basie johnny cash sammy davis jr carlos jobin  wow not good oh by the way my i hate your guts on the kindle 
[03:12:30]  does not have a table of contents and i know that there's still reason for that i know that  that was left out on purpose why just because some of the people i attack i know it i'm serious i  know it unbelievable um is that is that the niece and jerry lee lewis yeah it looks like a  fucking cousin he's a little cousin i was a little cousin do you understand hey you know i look and go  hey i understand that guy what are you gonna do knock him because uh for what what a creep 
[03:13:00]  polar he could he could at least made her look like she was a little older he was like and this  is back in the days where kids looked like you just from the black and white pictures they looked  older what a horrible haircut she had oh it's awful for a 13 year old you should have put her in  pigtails and stuck in her shitter big jambini ramsey hair she has i bet he made her made her look  older i bet when he fucked her she had the pigtails and when they went out he's like darlin you  gotta put that up in a bouffant you better gussy yourself up my uncle mark played him no i played 
[03:13:30]  my uncle mark played a guy who was a jerry lee lewis fanatic in a reenactment on america's most  wanted oh no kidding yeah the guy was a i guess an abuser look how young this chick what that's  hysterical how the fuck did he get away with this oh he didn't really yeah some people  career yeah we're like a wee bit a little wee bit but he thought it'd be just oh my he thought 
[03:14:00]  it'd be okay just to parade her out there right everybody she is a little egghead she's like a  little sarah silverman yeah a little bit a little bit a little bit uh he didn't give a flying  fuck though that guy after a while he might have though and hurt him but you know what he's still  around right yeah oh yeah chris in wisconsin makes a very good point doesn't a man's man not read  books a real man i think a man's man doesn't read watch his movies he sacrificed his time to 
[03:14:30]  write the book to show real men how to be a man's man here's my problem with sinatra it's not that  i think he stinks because he doesn't stink and he's not talentless he obviously is talent it's that  he his lyrics were horrid he sings about mundane stuff they were just terrible the words were awful  about summer wind they kept blowing in across the sea some of summer wind what's wrong with  summer wind what's right about it play some it's it's it's very visual it's a nice little song 
[03:15:00]  uh uh yeah  everybody  the great frank sinatra ladies on your frank sinatra station  serious satellite race this is okay came blowing in from across the sea the sea 
[03:15:30]  and then what happened it lingered there to touch your hair and walk with me  the summer wind touched your hair and walked with our wife  all summer yeah he didn't write any of this shit by the way he had writers they just were song  long yeah it's a perfect picture of what summer is what you don't want the beach obviously jimmy  and i'll shove it in exactly better yeah like painted kites painted kikes that's terrible 
[03:16:00]  song's not hurting anyone jimmy  the blue umbrella sky this is one of his better ones the lyrics are kind of bad though this is one  of his better songs  softer than a piper man a piper man one day it called to you 
[03:16:30]  what happened i lost you to the summer how did he lose her  well did she get blown away or did she go fuck the piper guy  oh blew you back in with a black baby in your womb  frank vincent yelled at you you walked down the street and i wouldn't fuck you either 
[03:17:00]  that's what you get for fucking the piper man with sand in your pussy you whore  the summer wind blew all the leaves and the children played in them until a dump truck ran over  the pile  summer tears that's what the parents cried at the funeral of the crushed youngsters  oh good winter wind  the parking lot iced up the old lady slipped and cracked her head open 
[03:17:30]  she was raped by an orderly and she bled from the nose  summer wind summer wind that's one of his better songs like even though lyrically it's kind of dumb  it was very romantic back then but what's one i hate because of courses you got to learn to hold your 
[03:18:00]  horses i don't um uh it's  fucking keep going was it a hit that's all i know i blocked the rest out nice and easy  try nice and easy a lot of people saying that frank sinatra didn't write his own lyrics he didn't  but these guys didn't write their own he still could have brushed them up when he was reading them  nah most of them were written by some coon my way was a good one but of course paul anka wrote  that as we all know just they were all faces back then of course they were all  no but he was good to sammy i respect sinatra i actually do yeah yeah he wouldn't stay at a hotel 
[03:18:30]  if they wouldn't let sammy stay oh sleep let's take it nice and easy okay something breezy  be so easy oh easy twice easy easy  us to fall in love  all right this means nothing to me so far  hey baby what's your hurry um scurry  relax and don't you worry oh oh what worry worry again hurry worry oh nice right so far nothing 
[03:19:00]  has happened in this song no  get into your pants  uh  the problem now of course is uh horses to simply hold your horses that's horrendous of course 
[03:19:30]  jesus don't let him fuck your butt unless he forces your cheeks open with a crowbar  that's gonna kick in now  man there you go  on the road to romance 
[03:20:00]  that's safe to say yeah  but let's make all the stops along the way snap that's right and while we stop  let me yell at my wife in the casino  all right go to seattle get killed fucking horses  take that two-foot dick in your backside  oh i'll film it i'll laugh 
[03:20:30]  that's it  nice and easy does it that's what you say while you're fucking her in the butt  nice and easy does it and then you check for shit on the shaft  nice and easy does it you don't want to get shit and blood on the comforter nice and easy does it  easy she said her best friend loves it 
[03:21:00]  you open her up with a couple of fingers first you do the old feel around for a nugget with your middle finger  if you feel what feels like judd hirsch's nose in her ass hole you don't put it in that's  when you really hold your horses  that's what he means by holding your horses  yeah hold your horses when you put you put your finger in a girl's ass and you feel like a little finger tick  it's like the fucking it's like the finger of god painting by michelangelo 
[03:21:30]  you're fingering her ass and then nugget is poking back you're like bad time for anal the old testaroo  because you know if you put your dick in all your dick does is it taunts the  shit like it's an angry raccoon in the cage and then it comes out  you pull your penis out and the shit chases your dick out angrily  that's awesome it's like a bunch of raccoons  easy does it 
[03:22:00]  you don't want a  asshole to prolapse on your white blanket  i don't think i can listen to sinatra anymore  oh you don't like any crooners no  no  no  i don't  who's another one  dino  try tony bennett  oh tony bennett  try tony bennett  i always thought he was overrated too  whoo  tired of these guys  but how do you know if they're overrated 
[03:22:30]  i don't like them  they all sound the same  try some tony bennett that was sinatra's favorite singer  and that was what tony bennett prided himself on  being sinatra's favorite singer  but who's sinatra's gonna say himself  tell travis to start spelling tony bennett t-o-n-i  all right  oh good this is a dud already  watching her appeal  from every angle  every angle  every  i've got to wangle  for i've fallen for a certain lovely lass 
[03:23:00]  uh-oh  hope she lets me stick my cock right in her ass  and i hope she don't  when she sits on my face  i hope she don't pass gas  it makes these songs way better to listen to  knowing that that's what he's getting at though  he wants to finger bang this broad  but he can't say  because it's the 40s and the 50s  i've fallen in love with a little lass  i'm gonna put my fingers in her cunt 
[03:23:30]  right after we go to maths  they gotta keep it romantical  but you know what he's getting at  oh god damn  oh great  what is this  the clint  and the ass  the arms  he's singing about what he's gonna hack off 
[03:24:00]  after he fucking wrenched a hitchhiker  the arms  i'll throw her in a ditch  she'll crawl back up  and wave a car down  with her head  cause her arms are no good  cause i cut him off  she'll never play pick up sticks again  he did rhyme angle with wangle right 
[03:24:30]  nobody says wangle  and what is a wangle  angle should have been something else  don't put your dick in the mouth of a girl with braces  it'll come out in mangles  love if at least a small percent of me do  me do  me too  oh no  oh  oh  don't leave me  to fuck a spook or a hebrew  oh alright

[03:29:00]  I have been  and always will be  your friend  there's  I laughed out loud  when Spock came on  I finally saw  live long and prof  finally saw the new Star Trek  because Anthony  fucking took me out  of the goddamn  it was supposed to be  the most dramatic scene  on the movie  and I'm laughing my ass off  but dude I didn't know  there was something about it  that bothered me  on a level that was  below consciousness  it was almost like 
[03:29:30]  someone threw  itching powder on me  I was like  I didn't know what it was  and when Anthony said  he's talking over his dentures  it became crystal clear  that's exactly  James Kirk  James  I've been waiting for you  waiting on this icy planet  for you  it's horrible fucking dentures  oh wait they had gone  through a black hole  or something right  yeah  and how come Spock  went through older  or James didn't  well because he didn't  go through  who didn't 
[03:30:00]  Kirk  just Spock went through  from old times  and got up to new  old  or went back in time  that time travel  confused the fuck  oh yeah  the paradox  that was a good movie  though right  I liked the new Star Trek  it was really fucking good  and I'm not even  near a trek  good story  loved it  yeah  the fucking  like characters  they got to play him  it wasn't even  because that was  one of those things  that could have been  so bad  and fucked up  like every Trekkie  would have been like  what are you doing  to our sacred characters

[03:37:00]  though  I mean it's  different than  most TV sets  it looks like  a kitchen  so she's never  too far away  from food  look at the  women in this  room  I don't think  he wants to  look at the  women in the  audience  they look good  don't they  they got some  cuties  the men too  he's dressed  like a reservoir  dogs  my dream date  what was your  dream date  would be to  hang out with  you and  watch Harry  Connick Jr  we could sit 
[03:37:30]  there and we  could cook for  each other  you would make  some beautiful  thing I would  make microwave  popcorn  nice  I'm making  limoncello  pasta later  in the show  that's very  delicious  she has a  lisp  well actually  you have a  very well  known very  cool very  sweet sweetie  of your own  Emily Blunt  and she  was  she was  the funny  one in  the devil  wears pride  of the  other secretary  when they  got sick  was she  not great  did you  did you  hear them  oh I  just heard  a little bit  I know  they go  oh  she's very 
[03:38:00]  English  we were just  making fun  of each  other  because she  you know  I'm Canadian  there's a  Simpsons episode  where little  Ralphie says  you know  one of the  kids says  I'm Canadian  I'm slowly  and she's  talking to me  and she's  saying  oh no  you make me  laugh  you make me  laugh  and I  can't understand  a thing  she says  what a fucking  horrible looking  mouth he has  I was just  waiting to say  it and never  really came out  maybe he's just  goofing on us  he looks like a  retarded Michael 
[03:38:30]  Madsen  when he talks  Emily Blunt  does his beard  epithode  by the way  E-Rock  got me good  before  what did he do  when he  knock into you  on the hole  no  but I was  saying before  that I was  annoyed that he  gets so many  things signed  he goes  yeah I'll make  sure not to get  dozens of  things signed  and he hands  me the two  Forrest Griffin  things he got  signed for me  oh what a prick 
[03:39:00]  he was right  though  alright  there was a  good Doug  Stanhope bit  that someone  wanted us to  play about  how you're  born free  and then they  take all your  freedom away  from you  as you go  through life  Stanhope's  pretty fucking  funny  maybe we  can play  that going  into break  if you  can find  it  I'll be on  Red Eye  tonight by  the way  for anybody  that gives  a turkey  who are you  on with  I don't know  I'm guest  hosting again  too but I  think it's  in a couple  weeks  really  you did a 
[03:39:30]  really good  job  thank you  that was  so much  fun  fun fun  you got  that Travis  if not  no worries  it's okay  there was  something else  that was worth  playing in a  break  I don't  recall  laughing Elvis  maybe  because we  were talking  about a  man's man  thing  man's man  I don't know  you got  something fun  for the break  there Travis  no not really  hang on  I know  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  the weather  outside  I can't 
[03:40:00]  listen to that  without thinking  of Die Hard  of course  I gotta rewatch  the Die Hard  movies  it's been a while  the first one  it's the only  one I really  yeah Die Hard 2  is not bad  2?  yeah  yeah 2  is alright  you start to  lose me  with Sam Jacks  I mean it  was an okay  one  Die Hard 3D  was awesome  so over the top  and that last  one  what was that  With a Vengeance  no no  not With a Vengeance  live hard  or die  trying  to live hard  when you're dying  that shitty one  that they sent us  to the premiere 
[03:40:30]  at Radio City  what a fucking  hunk of shit  that thing was  in the lemon's bed  right  what was that  Die Hard  with a hat  that was so bad  the other guys  did well at the box office  anyone see the other guys  over the weekend  sorry  here it's a fucking  killer movie  I saw a Serbian film  over the weekend  yeah that we gotta see  I got that one in my bag  I wanna check that out  yeah  there's some  ho  ho  ho  some pretty disturbing  scenes in that film  well Travis is gonna play 
[03:41:00]  something fun  as we go to break  here I think  I guess  what do you got  some gym production  are you panicking  what do you got  you know it's like  he is a panicking  Travis by the way  what we're doing  is called  just filler  little little  back and forth  we're doing  until Travis  finds something  but he should have  found something by now  but he's completely  panicked  panicked on us  you know  cause I had nothing  I'm not panicking  I just had nothing planned  you are so panicking  we're gonna play a nice  you know 
[03:41:30]  seven second sweeper  and then I was gonna  go to break  nah  now we need something  what do you got  so now you're like  hey let's play something  and I'm like  I don't know  what the fuck to play  see you're panicking  look at him  did you pick something though  I picked  Jim Norton  man of a thousand voices  who's that  Jesus  he's freaking out  can we play  laughing Elvis  sure we can play that  hang on  have we played  laughing Elvis in a while  Travis should have to pick  and then you guys  could decide if it's good  enough to play it  that is  I think I 
[03:42:00]  I think I  how about  I think I made that  point very obvious  when I said  how about laughing Elvis  how about laughing Elvis  ooh I like laughing Elvis  hang on let me find it  nice safe bet  laughing Elvis rules  trying to sing one of his songs  oh yeah  rumor has it  it was a bald guy  with a bad fitting toupee  or something  made it joke  I don't know  I like laughing Elvis  Steven  battery's just really high on pills  which is probably  probably more accurate  Steven S. Basher  turned us on to this  a while ago  so enjoy laughing Elvis 
[03:42:30]  are you lonesome tonight  do you miss me tonight  are you sorry  we drifted apart  does your memory stray  to a brighter summer day 
[03:43:00]  when I kissed you  and called you  sweetheart  do the chairs in your  boiler  seem empty  and bare  do you gaze  at your bald head  and wish you  had hair  a drop  filled with pain  shall I come back 
[03:43:30]  tell me dear  are you lonesome  oh lord lord  I wonder  you know someone said  the world's a stage  and each must play a part  oh god
