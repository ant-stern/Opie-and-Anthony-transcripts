<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Sam Roberts hosting "After ONA Live," focusing heavily on internal staff conflict.  The primary target of the discussion was Laszlo, accused by multiple hosts of repeatedly "throwing everyone under the bus," creating significant tension.  Rob Cross, a member of management, was also involved, particularly regarding his perceived lack of control over Sam Roberts' growing airtime on SiriusXM.  The hosts speculated on Laszlo's motives, suggesting a deliberate attempt to cause disruption.  The conversation also touched on a past incident involving Fez, with Rob Cross denying any intentional attempt to upset him.  Paul Bettany's earlier guest appearance was mentioned, along with his candid confession about a past altercation with paparazzi.  Opie described his unusual guest-pitching method with Roland, involving long walks and vegetable juice.

The show continued with a humorous anecdote about Club Soda Kenny, a usually teetotaler, getting drunk and singing "Secret Agent Man" after two martinis, leading to darkly humorous speculation about his late-night activities.  A significant portion focused on a prank call to E-Rock, who was on vacation, resulting in multiple unwanted connections to the show, much to E-Rock's displeasure.  This prank, and the reactions from Troy and Travis who facilitated it, was considered a highlight of the show.  E-Rock's participation in a Cinco de Mayo mayonnaise-eating contest, culminating in him vomiting, was also detailed.  The internal conflict discussion resurfaced, focusing on Laszlo and Bobo, with a brief mention of Sam Robertsâ€™ successful "Special Delivery" show.  The segment included frequent use of offensive language and crude humor.  Troy, Travis, and Roland were present in the studio throughout.

A subsequent segment shifted to discussions about expensive sunglasses (a $3000 and a $1400 pair), Mike's attractiveness and its effect on women, and an upcoming Long Island event.  Bobby Slayton's upcoming guest appearance was announced.  A humorous anecdote about the discovery of a dead body and the subsequent cleanup, mentioning "Flathead" and "Mikey Hollywood," was shared.  The strained relationship between Opie and Fez was revisited, with Opie clarifying he didn't intend to make Fez cry.  Paul Bettany's earlier appearance, this time specifically identified as the actor from *Priest*, was mentioned again. The segment concluded with promotion of the show's Facebook page and a transition to the Ron and Fez show.  Throughout the entire broadcast,  offensive language and crude humor were prevalent.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XR.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  I'm out of here.  You're not out of here. It's after. Everybody's still here.  The party's still going.  And management is still here.  I'm not gonna do the shit show.  Anthony's walking out. Gary's walking out.  But Rob Cross is still here.  Oh, yeah. Rob Cross knows he's stuck. 
[00:00:30]  That's not my music, Derek.  Did you throw me under the bus yesterday with Ron?  Did I?  I know a lot of people tweeting me.  I reported the facts.  What are the facts? Why are you throwing me under the bus?  I said that Laszlo came in and...  Laszlo threw everyone under the bus yesterday.  I didn't fucking have nothing to do with that.  But then I said that you and Laszlo together...  I was just saying that I suspect that Ronnie is a puppet master.  He doesn't like that.  He didn't like that.  Yeah, but you had to tell him.  Well, it was on the radio.  No, but maybe he wasn't gonna hear it. 
[00:01:00]  He was much more offended.  He didn't hear the show yesterday, and then you had to tell him that.  So now you threw me under the bus with Ronnie.  Because Ronnie's my call host.  I can't leave him in the dark.  I mean, him got plans.  What kind of plans?  I don't know.  He just got plans.  Well, I'd like to know.  You shouldn't have thrown me under the bus.  But I threw Laszlo under the bus.  It would have been part of the plans.  Not anymore.  Laszlo's a motherfucker.  Well, I know he is.  Laszlo threw me under the bus.  Several times.  Yeah, Rob Cross.  You didn't have anything to do with anything.  He just rags you into the dirt.  I think he ran out of people who were thrown under the bus, and he just tossed me under. 
[00:01:30]  I think Laszlo secretly wants to just break up this whole party.  He just likes to see destruction.  He literally threw everybody under the bus, where it made it very uncomfortable for anyone  to look at anyone today.  But see, Ron doesn't have a problem with you.  He's got a problem with Laszlo.  No, he does have a problem with me now, because you threw me under the bus.  But Laszlo said he was full of shit, as well as...  I just said I was suspecting.  I didn't call out Ron, nothing.  I had some suspicions.  That's it.  Well, I'll make sure he's aware of that when he comes in today.  And just so it's not twisted, I said hi to Fez in the hall today. 
[00:02:00]  Well, I know you and Fez have mended.  You guys are kind of friends again.  I have no problem with Fezzy.  You never did.  I'm just insulted that he thought that I made him cry on purpose.  Because you wouldn't have done that.  No.  Laszlo, on the other hand...  I'll go on Ron and Fez to explain it.  Again.  Today?  No, not today.  Why not?  I got shit to do.  But I did not make Fezzy cry on purpose.  And I'm insulted that he thinks that.  I'm really pissed off.  I don't even understand the way you...  I've done some shitty things with this radio show over the years.  And I've taken some responsibility for a lot of that stuff. 
[00:02:30]  But I'm not going to accept that he thinks I made him cry on purpose.  Well, it's also like the way you did it was...  Didn't you just ask him what Batman character he would be?  Yeah, what's wrong with that?  There's nothing that would lead me to believe that that was malicious.  And I kind of threw myself under the bus and said I would be kind of the Joker.  You know, the psychotic Joker, right?  Sure.  But I guess Fez didn't like the question.  Laszlo, on the other hand, the whole time he was in here was just...  Was shitting.  The suit tour.  There's a suit tour going on? 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  Right there.  Where?  What's going on around here?  What's going on?  I've seen a lot of suits lately and the stock's going up.  So I'm suspicious about this.  Remember where Rob crossed?  Oh, shoot.  I didn't know we were on the air.  The thing about it is you notice that the suits are taking more tours.  The stock is going up as this show after Opie and Anthony Live goes up as well.  I think that there is a relationship there.  That maybe more people are hearing about this.  That's why people are walking by saying, see, there's Sam Roberts hosting after Opie and  Anthony Live.  Or maybe because Eric's weight goes up, the stock goes up.  Oh, you're making Eric jokes again. 
[00:03:30]  No, I'm just reading what you wrote on a piece of paper.  By the way...  Did the whale bit work today?  It worked so well.  It worked well?  Classic.  Because we really tricked him to get him back on the phone.  Opie, we've got to talk about this again before you go.  Another guest that you weren't sure about goes over like a million bucks.  That's a bit.  What do you mean?  Last time you said it wasn't a bit.  It's a bit.  It's all a bit.  Yeah, why not?  Everything's a bit.  But you didn't even know who he was.  As soon as I saw him, I went, oh, that guy.  Oh, that guy.  I can talk to that guy.  How many times we've done that on the show? 
[00:04:00]  That guy.  Yes, Benny.  I'm his nominee for an Oscar.  That guy.  No, Paul Bettany was awesome.  He'll be back, too.  And I've got to ask you again, with Roland in the room.  No, I've got to ask you.  I've got to ask Rob Cross something.  Rob Cross.  When are you going to fucking pop this kid's head?  Who's?  Oh, Sam's head?  And bring him back down to earth.  When we stop giving him radio shows.  I mean, he just gets more and more airtime.  I don't think it's...  It's not just me.  I mean, he gets airtime from hits one.  He gets airtime on this show.  Now he's got his own spinoff show, kind of.  I think what Rob Cross is saying... 
[00:04:30]  It has to be a company-wide head popping.  It doesn't say Rob Cross's name on the wall.  His head's getting a little big.  You know that, Rob, right?  Yeah.  As management, what are you going to do about that?  Well, right now...  So you don't control me, but you control this fucker.  So I'm going to sit back and see what you do about this situation.  There is no situation.  That is absolutely out of hand at this point.  Yeah.  I mean, part of it's really up to me.  I mean, the guy's been doing afternoons on hits one now, and I have no control over that.  Exactly.  I'll still be the hits one champion.  Air 828 on Twitter. 
[00:05:00]  I love how guests start their interviews, because we were just talking about Paul Bettany.  Yeah.  They start their interviews guarded, then by the end, they're admitting to alcoholism.  That should be in a promo.  That's how great we are, and that's how comfortable we make these people.  Out of nowhere, you got Paul Bettany to admit that he cold-cocked a paparazzi that he didn't want to say.  Yeah, we might want to.  He did?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oops.  So do you think that Roland is responsible for bringing in better guests, or that you and Anthony have just stepped your game up to such a level? 
[00:05:30]  I say teamwork.  You think so?  Roland breaks me down.  We meet in the neighborhood.  We get a vegetable juice.  Well, Roland gets a milkshake, but go ahead.  And yesterday, I had my kid on my chest.  Paparazzi came up to you?  And I like to see how long Roland could hang with me before I finally go, okay.  Yesterday, how many miles do we walk?  Too many.  I would say at least three miles.  And for Roland.  And he's like, and I'm like, you're all right, right? 
[00:06:00]  And he doesn't want to give up on pitching guests.  His head, I swear to God, you were sweating profusely.  You were out of your mind, tired, sweaty, and I'm still like just taking pictures and tweeting and, you know, and hanging out with my son.  And then finally I gave him answers on future guests that will be on the show soon.  So that's the new game that you won't answer him when he's in the studio.  You say, come by my place later.  And then you make him go for walks.  I go, hey, you're out for a juice?  He goes, yeah.  And I'm like, okay.  And then I'd like to see how long he could last. 
[00:06:30]  Because I could walk forever in this fucking city.  Why aren't you filming this stuff?  You should be filming Roland guest pitches while he's sweatily walking.  You've got to make him pitch on a bike, Ope.  I know you like the bike.  Just put Roland, you know, on a bike right behind you.  Did you have business calls you take?  Six, eight miles.  I like that.  West side bike path.  Yeah, Roland.  I didn't know how to ride a bike.  I haven't ridden a bike.  You're going to have to learn.  Throw some training wheels on it.  You look good on a bike.  I think you could pull that off.  I don't think I've ridden a bike.  Jesus.  Oh, you were with me because I need someone to back me up.  The homeless guy that was scraping his feet.  Oh, yeah.  That happened, right?  With a stone. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Like, he just kept on scraping.  I mean, I know what happened.  But when I tell some of this shit on the air, I think people are like, ah, he's full of shit.  But this guy was scraping.  And did I not pull the camera out of my pocket?  But I made a deal with my wife.  Like, when I have the kid, I can't take as many fucking chances.  But what about when you got Roland?  Because Roland can block you off.  Roland can protect the kid at least a little.  This guy was giving me a look like he would have ripped my fucking face off.  But he had, it was a stone?  A sharp stone.  It wasn't even something that you could buy in CBS.  It was like he found a sharp stone to get the skin off the bottom of his feet. 
[00:07:30]  You could hear him scrape.  You could hear him just go whoosh.  And then he, like, took the rock and kind of went like this so all the skin would fall off  so he could start over.  And I'm dying.  I'm like, I gotta film this.  But I know I might have to run.  And I don't think I could run with the kid on my chest.  I'll run like Jesse Owens.  Who do you think was more of an issue?  That homeless guy or lipstick homeless guy from CBS?  Oh.  You remember that guy?  Lipstick homeless guy.  We never got a tape, I don't think.  No, you got a, I don't know if he even got a photo. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, he would chase, anytime we took a camera out, he'd get up and start running.  He was really intimidating.  Yeah.  And that stupid Roland doesn't understand the Asians in the park thing that we've talked  about on the show.  You go into Central Park any day of the week, you'll see Asian couples getting their picture  taken as a bride and groom.  They look miserable.  It's fake.  It's for some kind of fucking magazine somewhere.  It's a total scam.  I don't know what they're doing.  You don't know what the end result is?  Every day, you would think they would have enough photos of Asians walking around Central 
[00:08:30]  Park as bride and groom.  Is it the same people or you can't tell?  That's very racist.  I'm asking.  I was just a question.  I could tell because they have different haircuts.  So, you're very racist.  Well, that's true.  Asian people, is that it?  You're leaving on that?  I mean, that's a good note to leave on, I guess.  Rob, thanks for participating.  It was my pleasure.  Rob had it a lot.  Yeah, well, two things.  He's a, listen.  The bike pitch?  The bike pitch was nice.  The bike pitch is good.  Yeah, and he's done more on the air than just about anybody else in management. 
[00:09:00]  Let's be honest about that.  Are you going to play any O&A bits today or is it going to just go over this?  Well, yesterday we only had...  When was the last time you played an O&A bit in the 10 o'clock hour?  The problem was yesterday we only had a two-hour show, so I didn't get to any bits.  You did two hours with Ron.  Now this hour has become...  Oh, that's Kenny.  I better go.  Tell Kenny to just call in.  No, because Jimmy's tired.  We've got to get out of here today.  Jim can come back up.  Are you playing O&A bits today?  I just need to know.  We'll see if I get to it, you know?  I mean, my plan is to, but my plan was to yesterday.  You had to? 
[00:09:30]  No.  I'm on the air.  Iraq was hanging up.  And by the way, Roland, we have some stuff to talk about as far as Iraq is concerned.  Me and you.  You're not done.  You need stuff to talk about.  You're supposed to be pushing play.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I don't know if that's what you thought was going to happen, but it's not what this is.  This idea, we all went, yeah, that sounds cool.  Yeah, I remember agreeing to that as well.  You're pushing...  Idiot, you're mad at me.  Stop this.  I can't hit the play button from here.  Exactly.  Hit it.  I don't have any responsibility here. 
[00:10:00]  Let's go.  You do.  You can tell them, you know what, Sam?  Stop the bullshit.  I think last Thursday was the last time we played an O&A bit, right?  It could have been if we got to it on Thursday.  The deal is, once I get behind the microphone, maybe the rules start to change.  You can tell Kenny I'm on my way because he's listening.  All right, Kenny, if you're down there, which I'm sure you are, Opie is on his way and Roland's  following him.  I guess...  Let's do this.  Rob, we should play a bit?  Yeah, we'll talk about former producers, one of the two.  What do you want to do?  Is he rock a former producer yet?  I don't know.  I want to play something because, speaking of Club Soda Kenny, who's downstairs, he was 
[00:10:30]  telling cop stories today, although he claimed they were from a movie.  He did seem to have fairly good first-hand knowledge of them.  Club Soda Kenny's done a lot for this show in the years, and I was going through some  of our favorite Club Soda Kenny moments.  And if you didn't hear Club Soda Kenny's cop stories, by the way, you should listen  to the replay.  Just play it!  It starts at three.  See, I just plugged that, Rob.  Did you hear that?  It's a radio thing.  Rob Cross has left the building. 
[00:11:00]  But it was the day that Club Soda Kenny never drinks.  He doesn't...  I've never seen the guy drunk, and I've seen him socially and at work.  He never drinks.  He decided to drink once while members of the show were around him, and he ended up singing  Secret Agent Man.  This is the story of Club Soda Kenny and Secret Agent Man, just for you, Club Soda, because  I know you're listening in the car right now as you wait for Opie to come down with Roland,  who's pitching guests as we speak. 
[00:11:30]  It's Club Soda Kenny, Secret Agent Man, on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Where's Club Soda Kenny?  Is he ready to sing Secret Agent Man?  I want to hear this, and why he did it.  Ew, that was a power walk he did, and he didn't jog, and he didn't walk.  It was the power walk.  That's how we chased perps back in the old days.  Bad hips.  I can't run.  I have a bad hip.  Slow down, perp.  Jimmy and I were wondering what Club Soda Kenny does when we all finally go to bed, because 
[00:12:00]  Club Soda Kenny is like, he makes sure we're all safely in our rooms.  That's his whole gig on the road.  Tucked in nicely.  He makes sure we're all tucked in nicely.  He would tuck us in if we allowed him.  Oh, yeah.  If we allowed him to.  And then we're on the way to the airport, like 5 in the morning, yesterday, 5.30, whatever  it was, and Jimmy and I are talking about, you know, we're wondering what he actually  does when we're finally all safely in our rooms, and we came up with a pretty sick scenario.  Opie said, do you think he goes out and kills hookers? 
[00:12:30]  And I'm like, no, but I do think he goes out and lurks around them and bothers them.  Kenny's not a murderer.  Here's what Kenny would do, which is even creepier.  There's a girl trying to work the corner, and all of a sudden she'd see this just big  Muldoon in the shadow, and he would just say things to the Johns like, you should probably  go home now.  I don't think you want to do that.  You got to think it through.  Just ruining their night. 
[00:13:00]  You might want to think this through.  Just spoiling.  Ken's a spoiler of fun.  He's not a murderer.  He's a spoiler of fun.  Do I see a wedding ring on your finger?  Ken, shouldn't you be home with your family?  Why are you doing this?  No expression.  No, not even a chin in the shadow.  They don't even see Kenny.  They just see his shadow cast from a lamppost like doom on the wall.  And the little mouth moving, you might not want to do that. 
[00:13:30]  Give it a few minutes of thought.  If you still want to, fine.  Aren't you scared of AIDS?  You know there's a gym that's open 24 hours a day.  Most of these women are just here to rob you.  Dr. Phil says.  If you replace one thing, like we were trying to wean a horse off of hay, so he took a bite out of my hair. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, it was a great scenario.  We have a lot of chuckles.  It made us laugh on the way to the airport.  Just knocking on windows and just blowing up everyone's spot.  Like the son of Sam with no gun.  Right.  They just park and he just raps on the window.  Could you open the window?  And the John gets paranoid, kicks the hooker out.  The pimps watch it from a doorway somewhere like, ah, great.  You know, Robert.  Just wrecking everyone's time.  Oh, you hear that? 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, you want to talk to him now?  I don't know.  That's pretty funny.  So Friday night, we go to the foundation room at the House of Blues.  They treat us like freaking rock stars.  They were great to us.  They were very nice.  It was a lot of fun and we're all hanging out.  And we talked Kenny into getting a couple of martinis.  Not one, but two.  Wow.  I've never seen you drink.  I must have been sauced.  G.H. told me to have a cocktail, so.  We figured it was time for him to just loosen up a little bit. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, but even if he tells you something, you're like a sleepwalker.  Whereas if you tell a sleepwalker to walk up a building, they usually won't.  They won't do something unnatural.  Right, right.  That's what he's like.  Whereas if old tells him to do something that's completely unnatural, which will affect his guarding ability.  Yeah, he'll still do it.  He won't do it.  No, no, I've never seen him drink.  Even with Dice, I've never seen him drink.  Well, he had two martinis, which just put him over the top.  Oh, no.  He was off duty.  Don't worry, Kenny.  You're still a perfect employee.  Jesus.  And then we go back to the bar. 
[00:15:30]  Well, he was kind of singing Secret Agent Man on the sidewalk.  Then we go back to the hotel bar, and he's having another cocktail.  And then talking about how he used to drink back in the day.  Uh-oh.  But I haven't drank in 18 years because why?  Because babies don't understand hangovers.  You know, so when my kids were little, you know, they'd be waking up and jumping on your head at 7 o'clock in the morning because they want to play.  And, you know, you'd be all hungover.  So I chose to stop drinking so I could spend quality time with my family. 
[00:16:00]  What OCD?  He put his alcoholism aside for a couple of decades, and now he can resume it and enjoy it as the boys are older.  He's probably just counting down the days until his youngest is through high school.  Imagine a hungover Kenny picking somebody up and arresting somebody and then them giving Kenny a hard time what he must have done.  Yeah.  Like, you don't even understand.  Shut up or I'm going to beat you again.  He's horrible after 10 hours of sleep on Christmas morning. 
[00:16:30]  Can you give us a few verses of Secret Agent Man?  I don't know if you can recreate the moment.  I think you can in this case.  I understand that.  We think you can.  I'd love to hear it.  We all would, Ken.  All the guys want it.  One of my favorites.  You want some music?  What a music, Kenny?  Like, you know, we're walking back from the House of Blues to the hotel, and, you know, Cleveland's like the day after of a nuclear bomb.  It's all deserted and, you know, no people, no traffic. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, downtown is just a mess, but they're building everywhere else.  And I don't know what happened, but, you know, I just started singing Secret Agent Man to be entertaining, I guess.  Did you?  Yeah.  All right.  Give us a verse, will you?  All right.  If you have to, close your eyes.  Don't be shy.  All right.  There's a man who leads a life of danger.  Everyone he meets, he stays a stranger.  Every move he makes, another chance he takes. 
[00:17:30]  Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow.  Secret Agent Man.  Secret Agent Man.  They're giving you a number and taking away your name.  He knows every word.  Wow.  Secret Agent Man.  How do you know that?  Because that was my thing, like, when I was going to become a cop.  Are you secretly doing karaoke at night? 
[00:18:00]  No.  He's probably going to, like, an all-night karaoke bar when we go to bed.  You hold a tune the way Christopher Reeve could hold a pirouette.  My favorite part.  Secret Agent Man.  Well, that was the part that had us just dying on the way home from the hotel.  Oh, my favorite part.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I'm a crooner.  Quite the crooner.  The crooner.  Because he thinks of himself as kind of a secret agent there, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There it is.  Is this a karaoke version? 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  You want to do it again with karaoke?  Yeah.  Go ahead, sweetie.  Do you know where it kicks in?  No.  All right.  Here.  It's where the music kind of changes.  Ant's pretty good at this.  Watch his cue.  Yeah.  No, not yet.  There's a man who leads a life of danger To everyone he meets, he stays a stranger 
[00:19:00]  With every move he makes, another chance he takes Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow  Secret Agent Man Secret Agent Man They're giving you a number  And taking away your name  Beware of pretty faces that you find A pretty face can hide an evil mind 
[00:19:30]  I'll be careful what you say Or you'll give it all away  Odds are you won't live to see tomorrow  There he goes  Secret Agent Man Secret Agent Man 
[00:20:00]  They're giving you a number And taking away your name  Is this the chorus?  Yeah  I thought a little lead went here or something  A little more Secret Agent Man there, right?  Yeah, there's another verse, but I don't know in the start 
[00:20:30]  He holds the directions with this big dumb thumb moving  Here it comes, Secret Agent  Secret Agent Man Secret Agent Man  They're giving you a number And taking away your name  Swinging on the Riviera one day  See, they screwed it up 
[00:21:00]  So that verse should have been there  And that should have  Not your fault, Kenny  Thank you  What a great way to end this song, though  Of course  Hey, can you do that song at our Halloween party?  Yes  If we get the karaoke?  Oh, I'd love to see him do that in front of a festival crowd  Who actually sings this, besides hopefully never you again?  Secret Agent Man  Secret Agent Man  Rather than listen to that, I'd rather get a face full of 
[00:21:30]  Agent Orange  After ONA  Live  That's what it is  After ONA  I'm Sam Roberts  Opie and Anthony have left  Opie's gone now  He was here  I hope he was listening  Proof that sometimes I play bits on this show  That was Club Soda Kenny doing Secret Agent Man  He had a great cop story that he told today  Of course  It wasn't his experience  It was a movie that he saw  But still  A great story nonetheless  And just now  Eastside Dave  Called my cell phone 
[00:22:00]  I guess Eastside Dave is the last person  To realize that I'm on the air right now  I can't  I can't answer my phone  Speaking of phone calls  Roland, you're in here now  Yes  Your buddy  E-Rock  Is probably  Your best friend on the show, correct?  Yeah  I mean, you guys share an office  Yeah  You go to lunch together all the time  That's correct  He asked you to be the best man at his wedding  Yes  You went to see Harry Potter instead 
[00:22:30]  That, that, yes  Yes, that is correct  IMAX  However, and  Troy should come down here  Anybody who had anything to do with this E-Rock thing  Can come and  Chat  Because  He's on vacation this week  Yes  He gets a lot of heat on this show  A lot of  He gets yelled at a lot on this show  He's on vacation  We got his hotel room phone number  And started calling him today  As a matter of fact  There's Troy right now  Troy  You were phone screening today  And Opie actually said on the air  If you didn't hear any of this 
[00:23:00]  You have to  This was my favorite part of the show  A hundred percent  Troy, was it yours?  What's  Oh, absolutely  You love doing this  Oh yeah  Like, because I know  You're not necessarily the happiest person  That all you get to do during the show  Is screen calls  But this brought me a lot of joy  So yeah  I mean, because  Usually you're just taking calls from people  And you're like  Ugh  I want to be doing something  I didn't think it was funny  You guys kind of crossed the line  When someone was on vacation  Okay, well we'll get  I'll definitely comment on that  In just a minute  But today  Today 
[00:23:30]  Troy  Your phone screening duties paid off  Well, it's one of those things where  I was told  By the bosses  Yeah  Your job today  Opie said  Troy  What are you doing  Not calling E-Rock back  Your job today  Is to call his hotel  While he's on vacation  Get him on the phone  And get him on the phone  And that's what I tried to explain to Eric  Look  Hey  I'm just doing what I'm told  Opie needs to speak with you  You need to get on the phone  Was he pissed when you told him?  Oh, he was  He was livid  Was he?  Well, first of all  When I called him  It sounded like he was sleeping  The first time 
[00:24:00]  First time  Well, I would assume  That the fact that he's  On a tropical island  On vacation for a week  And it was quarter to eight  In the morning or so  You probably was asleep  But the buffet's open at nine  So, okay  So he might have been pre-gaming  Yes  Yeah  So, yeah  So he seemed pissed off  That I called  And he was just like  You've got to be kidding me  No, I'm not going on there  I'm not  See, at this point  Eric has worked for the show  For all these years  Did he not think  That it was within the realm 
[00:24:30]  Of possibility  That we were going to call  His hotel room  While he was on vacation  And find him  Right  Yeah, of course we're going to  Yeah  That's  Eric's whole job here  Unfortunate as it may be  I didn't give him the job  But the job that he has been  You know, grouped with  Is to be made fun of  Yeah  He did say a thousand a night  I believe  Yeah, he did  He went on the air  And said a thousand a night  Travis, you vacation  At Disney World a lot  Two thousand a night  Do you go a thousand a night?  A thousand dollars?  A thousand dollars a night?  Yeah  Maybe a thousand dollars 
[00:25:00]  For like the week  You try to, you know, budget  That's crazy  What about you, Troy?  A thousand dollars a night?  Yeah, that's a little excessive  But, you know  He lives the high life  You know what I mean?  Like, he does  He does very well for himself  So  Yeah, I mean  He's in a completely different  You know, bracket  A tax bracket, you mean?  Oh, you're saying  Because he makes so much more  Than the rest of us?  Exactly  Okay, and Troy  You were saying the same thing?  Oh, absolutely  Yeah, I was just  I was just trying to  Clarify exactly what was being said here  Where the three of us  Might be going  Like, looking for  Like, even like to splurge 
[00:25:30]  Go two or three hundred bucks a night  For a splurge  To him, it'd be the same  As going one thousand to fifteen hundred  Maybe  It's like Motel 8 for four hundred a night  Okay  Okay, I understand  Yeah, like he probably didn't like  Search the internet for a half hour  Like looking for a discount code, you know?  He didn't care  No  Like, it was out there  But he was like  But it's not worth the half hour of my time  Exactly  That's neither here nor there  Whatever, I mean  He just wants to go down  And have a good time  That was the only thing on his agenda  And this morning  The only thing on your agenda  Was to make sure he wasn't having a good time  Look, as I said before 
[00:26:00]  The bosses told me to do that  And I'm just doing what I'm told  Did you think you were gonna  Because you ended up getting him on  For that second time  Right  I didn't think it was gonna happen  Well, there was enough period of time  That maybe he had thought that  Well, something else  This may be somebody else  Yeah  That's what I think  And then  And then it was you  And then it was literally like  I would be  Going like this to Travis  Like, tell them he's ready  Because I was so afraid  That if he was waiting on hold  For like  Five seconds  It would be over  Okay, so 
[00:26:30]  There was a strategy going on  Between you and Travis  Right  And then there was some communication  And then from there  It goes to Danny  And then Danny  So you would keep him talking  Until you knew Opie was ready  So then you could put him on hold  And Opie could pick him up immediately  Exactly  Sam did say  He went down the slide  Water slide  And caused a tsunami  Well, alright, Roland  If you want to play games  Roland  I was sitting in my office  While this was going on  I was enjoying it  As I enjoy lots of segments  On the show  I was shocked and sickened  Travis, did you enjoy  The phone call?  You guys were talking about 
[00:27:00]  How it was your favorite  Bit of the day  Yeah  Week  Favorite bit of the week  I think it was rude  And I called for it  So Travis, that has your vote  For number one on the countdown  I don't see there being  Anything to top that  I second that  And that would include the  How long was Ant doing whale calls for?  It was probably  Close to four minutes  I was trying to  I was trying to watch  On the clock on the phone  And it was  It was getting up there  And E-Rock was on the phone  The whole time  Yeah  Oh my god  That probably made him  Really upset  It was just  It just went on so long 
[00:27:30]  I was just fucking  Laughing my ass off  And Roland  Yes  As we  This guy  Like Troy, Travis  You guys know this  Roland and E-Rock  Are pretty much best buds  Around here  They always go out together  They always  You know  Hook each other up with stuff  They got each other's backs  They're office mates  You know  They are like  And I've said this before  You two are long lost brothers  Have I said that to you guys?  Yes  Yeah because you know  They play fight with each other  Everything  It's like they're long lost brothers  You guys can come in  And look at the studio  Come in and look at the studio 
[00:28:00]  They're giving  Somebody  They're giving a tour  Come in and look at the studio  Who is  Who is this?  He's  Introduce us  Who is it we're doing  The studio to  What's up man?

Yes I am  Is he a good tour guide?  Oh he's fantastic  He's fabulous  This guy just retired 
[00:28:30]  What?  Retired Marine right?  Right  Wow  And are you retired?  Like are you done working?  Or are you just done being a Marine?  No it's more of a career transition  I'm only 42 years old  I was about to say  You look very young to be a retiree  I'm just figuring out  What I'm going to do when I grow up  I did something for 20 something years  You were a Marine for 20 something years?  Yeah  That's incredible  You see a lot of stuff?  Yeah it was an interesting time  To be on active duty  That's for sure  I would assume so  I would ask you more questions 
[00:29:00]  But you probably are trying to transition  Out of that area of your life  But you can get into radio  Now that you've seen all this  I mean this is the high life  Yeah I don't know if I have the right contacts or not  I think maybe  Well you know this guy now  He can get you in anywhere  And I'm your friend on Facebook  So you never know  That's two of us  Yeah exactly  Well enjoy your tour  Thank you  And this is the inside of the studio  So have fun  It's magnificent  Thanks so much  Alright buddy  See Troy we bring everybody in here  Yeah  On After ONA Live 
[00:29:30]  It's all love  I want everybody to experience what goes on  While you know  They think the mics are off  We just leave the mics on  So Rowan  Yes  Brothers from different mothers  You and E-Rock  Yeah  You get to the point  Where you play fight with each other  You punch each other  You hug each other  You watch movies together  You play together  Everything  You guys are best friends  Pretty much  Yeah  And so what were you thinking  While E-Rock was getting made fun of  You said a minute ago  You were like  This is going a little too far  I thought so 
[00:30:00]  Okay well  The weird thing  Troy  Travis  Ron at Fezzenter  And the weird thing  Is  I was in my office  Which is next door to Rowan  In E-Rock's office  Rowan was in that office by himself  Because E-Rock's on vacation  And I was hearing some very strange noises  Coming from Rowan's office  As Rowan was listening to the show  So I went in with my microphone  You want to hear what Rowan's true  First of all  Did he know you were recording him?  Absolutely  I shoved the mic right in his face  Oh okay  I mean this is not a hidden mic 
[00:30:30]  This is  I mean I wanted to get the best sound possible  Right  And I knew  Rowan was going to try  To quell the sound  To calm it down  But I knew that Rowan was not going to be able to hold out  Because I'm a patient man Troy  Right  And I will sit in there until that sound comes out  It didn't take long  You want to hear Rowan's true  Rowan is this cool?  Your true reaction  Is it cool to have a choice?  No you don't  This is Rowan  As the E-Rock phone call was happening  This is disgusting 
[00:31:00]  I can't believe I can find it  One week off  From being called  Bastard  All day  I'm singing  I'm singing  That goddamn  You leave me  I have to go  You leave me  I have to go  You leave me  wiIf  There's an  Bei  On the  A  Is that  I don't  I have to  Go  Go

[00:32:30]  All week long  Ah Jesus  Roland you doing okay?  Yes  You were drooling  There was phlegm coming up  Jimmy killed me  Yeah well you know what he was doing  He was making fun of E-Rock for being super fat  Yeah  Yeah he was  So do you take back what you were saying before  Because you just said I finally got an honest reaction  Out of you after 
[00:33:00]  And that was by the way cut down from several minutes  Of me sitting in there with him laughing  You finally broke down and said  This is the greatest thing that's happened all week  It was hysterical  What did you like better  You're the talent booker  So it's in your best interest for interviews to go well  What was more important to you  The Paul Bettany interview going well  Did I  The Paul Bettany interview going well  So today was I mean with that  With the E-Rock thing happening  And with Paul Bettany going well 
[00:33:30]  I said Titus first  Titus first  Beautiful Roland  Now um  We wanted to play something on Cinco de Mayo  That involved E-Rock  But for whatever  I don't remember what was happening that day  But we ran out of time on  After ONA Live  Today being that  E-Rock had such a strong appearance on the show  I figured that we continue to celebrate everything  That makes the sex bagel  The sex bagel  So this was  Hoagy boy too  That's right 
[00:34:00]  Hoagy boy too  Good one Roland  Sexy B  Sexy B indeed  The sex man  The sex man cometh  Everybody's got a different name  But I tell you  They all add up  The sexster  Pepper Hickson  With the sexster  E-Rock  Thought that I had stolen $500 from him  Later he found out that I had just put it in a drawer  And told him for three weeks  That I had spent it on concert tickets for Troy  He was mad  He did not talk to me for three weeks  Until I finally told him 
[00:34:30]  He wanted to kill you  Yeah he wanted to murder me  In order to win some of that money  That he thought he had lost back  Dr. Ian  From Dr. Ian  Yeah  Opie told him  And actually Opie, Anthony, Jim  Everybody put money in  And said  Alright  If you want to win  I think it was $300  It's Cinco de Mayo  Let's make it Cinco de Mayo  And you have to eat this entire jar of mayonnaise  He still celebrates that  On this day  E-Rock became sicker than I've ever seen him 
[00:35:00]  He ended up with bloodshot eyes  For days  For days  He actually had to take work off  Because he was mayonnaise sick  This is it  E-Rock  Celebrating Cinco de Mayo  By eating an entire jar of mayonnaise  In honor of the sex bagel  Who will be back tomorrow  We love you buddy  Here it is  Cinco de Mayo  On After Opie and Anthony Live  After Opie and Anthony Live  Yeah let's get the mayo thing going  It's Cinco de Mayo  Mayo  See how clever we are  E-Rock 
[00:35:30]  E-Rock has $350 in front of him here  If he could get a whole jar of mayo down  In the next hour  $350  I had a $300 count  Sam's throwing $50 in  Where's E-Rock  Let's get this going man  Yeah where is he  E-Rock  Come on sweetie pie  Oh you get the mayo  Hi my love  Where's Sam  He's gonna watch this  That is a lot of mayo  How many ounces  That's standard  Yeah  Get to the table E-Rock  We got a mic up here  This is  Over here  Sorry 
[00:36:00]  Right on the table  That's all I'm thinking  This is 30 ounces  Yeah  And let's check the nutrition  Oh it's Hellman's real mayonnaise  One tablespoon  Is that a serving?  Is 90 calories  Oh shit  How many tablespoons  Calories from fat  90  Okay  Total fat  10 grams  Oh shit  Sodium  90 milligrams  And that's in one tablespoon  And 5 milligrams 
[00:36:30]  Of cholesterol  Alright E-Rock  You got an hour  Okay  So I'll just go  Sit back over there  Oh no  We wanna start over here  You gotta start over here  You know  It's like the finish line  We wanna get a general feel for it  Or the starting line  Duh  Wow I thought that was  A glass jar  It's plastic  So you can actually  Squeeze it out  Into your mouth  It looks like  It's pink socking  Out of the top of the  Should I just bite  Into a chunk of mayo?  Yes  You should  Alright E-Rock  Let's go  Bite into a chunk of mayo  He's just gonna squeeze it out  And bite into it 
[00:37:00]  Like a big ice cream  Call  $300 up for grabs  He's actually doing that  With a glass  That's how hungry he is  In an hour  Alright  And he  Is about to be  Keeping helping  A mayonnaise  Ah  For Cinco de Mayo  Oh  There he goes  Oh my god  What do you think  Oh my god  Your mouth looks like  Steve  You want a napkin  Yes  How was that first  Heap and Heap  First one not bad  That's delicious  Yeah the first one  You gotta appreciate 
[00:37:30]  The boy does love  His mayonnaise  He's a sweetie  He really does love  His mayo  Have you made a dent in it?  Yeah  It's a dent  But  Quarter  It's that skinny part  Of the jar  Oh no  It's starting to fatten out now  I'm starting to hit the label  Yeah the label  Is the thickest part  Of the  He's doing alright though  Say what you want  About E-Rock  But he never disappoints  Uh oh  Oh oh oh  Alright  He just shuddered  He wasn't good  E-Rock just shuddered  At the  720 calorie mark 
[00:38:00]  Have a sip of Gatorade  Now the faces  Are a lot different  Yeah  He's making the face  You make them  Like the first  Oh  Wait wait  Oh  Oh god  Is he throwing up  Oh  Okay  There it goes  We have  We have a winner  Here  You alright  There you are  He doesn't look good  No  He's throwing up 
[00:38:30]  He's throwing up  He's throwing up  Oh  Bro  Bro  Bro  Bro  Bro  Bro  Bro  Bro  Bro  Bro  Bro  Bro  Bro  Bro  Bro  Bro 
[00:39:00]  Bro  Bro  Bro  Bro  Bro  Bro  one more oh wow the tip of his nose is wet it came out his nose a little bit right  and eyes and eyes came out of his eyes wow did you know something that is fantastic 
[00:39:30]  two things with that number one that those sounds were coming out of a human being that's what  happens when you eat an entire jar of mayonnaise not a travel size jar but a full supermarket size  jar of mayonnaise that those sounds would come out of a human being is absolutely horrifying  and number two uh everybody was laughing but the pure joy that came out of jim norton's laugh 
[00:40:00]  that pure just happiness and joyous giggle from his gut like he was uncontrollably happy  watching eric vomit a jar of mayonnaise was something that uh is unlikely to be seen again  by the way i'm looking at uh the instant feedback here somebody feedbacked in eric at siriusxm.com  location vacation and the message is sam tried calling 10 a.m no answer somehow i don't think 
[00:40:30]  that uh eric is feedbacking in during his vacation uh we did i'm thinking travis do you think i  should share this voicemail that bobo sent i talked about a while back i don't see why you would not  share it i want you to realize something that we were on uh vacation uh on friday we had no show on  friday um so i wasn't coming in early i figured i'd get here whenever i had to start my hits one air 
[00:41:00]  shift so i could sleep until eight o'clock which for those of us who do this for a living is quite  a luxury um however at about seven i was awakened by my cell phone ringing because bobo had to tell  me something uh i looked i saw that bobo was calling and i immediately hit ignore went back to  sleep realizing that i would have a voicemail waiting for me how i got uh how he got my cell phone  number i guess i'll never know but i would assume it was from you danny derrick travis would that be 
[00:41:30]  i can honestly say i had nothing to do with this one but were you in the room when it happened i  can't recall okay well i like the first one you can honestly say the second one it gets hazy  i mean you know it was early in the morning my memory's fuzzy uh bobo has accused me of being mean  to him because uh i take umbrage with the fact that he believes this show to be beneath him and  calls it the shit hour bobo named this show after opian anthony live the shit hour and he left me this 
[00:42:00]  voicemail yeah this is uh bobo this is bobo they gave me this number and they told me that the band was  never listed yesterday i don't know if you want i don't know if there's there's this is someone who  never got who never who never got that got the message whatever but i really did everything it was 
[00:42:30]  opposed to and all of a sudden they they they because they were talking about regarding those  types of the fc line before that and i said no those are never going to change the race  i don't know it's just a way you could set the street  or something or anything i just want a peaceful  i just want just to be nice to have a little bit discussion without me about this or something 
[00:43:00]  anything anything i could see if i haven't been in studio in a long time  i mean i just feel that if this if this band has really been lifted  that's when i would really know and it's right  i don't know right i guess i really appreciate everything with you guys are right 
[00:43:30]  i promise there would be bugging like this all right but  i i i wait patiently and i was told and you told me to call everybody i mean you you that i talked to the other day but  i i feel like these guys haven't gotten a message right  but the thing was lifted  since they weren't gonna great thanks thanks for everything 
[00:44:00]  i'm not so you know this number will not be saved on this phone  and that was it two and a half minutes long of a bobo voicemail rambling about nothing i brought bobo on this show he was on the phone  bobo i told you you had done a good job i told you you weren't banned just because we don't let you in the studio 
[00:44:30]  in the studio every single day does not mean you are banned the days that you are not in the studio  it's the same reason big a hasn't been in in a little while he's not banned he'll be in soon  you know whenever there's a reason to have him in or whenever he wants has a reason  big a will call us or we'll call him we'll have him in stalker patty same deal  any guess dr steve it's not just the weirdos our pal dr steve when there's a reason for him to be on he'll be on 
[00:45:00]  and everybody else is fine with this  everybody else can function in their normal lives without a problem  except for bobo if he's not on this show every single day  and by this show i don't mean this show i actually mean opian anthony  because as we've discussed  bobo believes that after opian anthony live at this point  is beneath the celebrity stature that bobo has achieved  didn't we pitch him an idea uh the other day and he asked specifically what show it would be for  yeah you tell me now what time will i be on 
[00:45:30]  because if it's ten o'clock i'm not gonna fall for that again  because he's really in a position to be making demands  yeah and this  do the the that bobo wouldn't get the exposure that he's so well deserves for what  i don't even know at this point you know you're being mean  i'm not being mean m-e-e-n  and then he's sending emails to norton on facebook saying everyone's being mean to him  because i tell him on the air that the ban has been lifted 
[00:46:00]  instead of just letting well instead of just leaving well enough alone  he learns on the air he gets complimented he has a good phone appearance on this show after opian anthony live  then he decides he has to call the office  Travis while you guys are working  and that's when he gets the new  that he's banned i don't know if he's banned or not  whoa  whoa  whoa  an unbelievable break in you can move that bin 
[00:46:30]  you that stuff doesn't have to be there you can just put it on the floor  everybody should make themselves at home here  because the party has arrived  the fact that i have an entourage  along with the great ron bennington  a little bit  yeah you sure do have an entourage  you're rolling 20 deep today  i hadn't heard that phrase  i don't keep up with the hip-hop kids  but rolling 20 deep  is that something to say  well it depends  yeah like if there's 20 people with you  you're rolling 20 deep  all right  everybody's here  these are celebrities too 
[00:47:00]  mikey boys everybody  well the  we just did it on mass today  i heard  some guy was doing a tour  and we brought him on the air  yeah i know i know you're doing my fucking  let's bring the tour in bed  let's bring the tour in bed  that's really nice  what's that a bit  but um  the fact is  we sat down did it on mass with kurt loader  and  it kicked so much ass  you know so much more went into that mtv news  than i ever really  i had no idea  i just heard you know the 30 second interludes  and  they get everything off the internet  wow 
[00:47:30]  they get they  what they do is they use alta vista  oh  how's everything going with you today  everything's going really well  uh opie took a little umbrage with me  mm-hmm  earlier on the after show  he thought that i had painted  an incorrect picture  of what he was saying about you  it did come across that way  and  i thought it incorrectly  he wanted to make sure that you realize that  this is a laszlo thing  that laszlo  i see i  i didn't know  the way that you said it came across as an opie thing  no i don't think that that's how i  yeah  trying to get it across 
[00:48:00]  certainly wasn't my intention  but now we're making it clear  and opie wanted to make this clear too  this is a laszlo thing  opie and ronnie b he says  are great  let's just get to the bottom of this  and we don't even have to dwell on it  okay good  but laszlo  because of what he said about fez  mm-hmm  and again we're all adults here  but laszlo is going to get fucked up  oh shit  and laszlo  is going to be drinking through a fucking straw  and not only what he said about fez  he said you were full of shit  i don't know if you forgot  i did forget that  so all right 
[00:48:30]  laszlo  and i know your real name is jeff  oh  because enough people i know where he lived  i know he lives out on long island  and all kidding aside  you know we're all adults  and you know  he's going to get his fucking  achilles tendon cut  for what he said about fez  and you know  he had fez upset yesterday  well you're not a guy who just says  didn't he talk to fez after the show  he text me  and saying we're cool right bro  which you know again i thought we were adults  yeah  but anyway coming up very soon  curt loader on unmasked  you're going to see a side of curt loader 
[00:49:00]  you've never seen before  well i'm very excited  i'm also reading feedback  pat from munaki  you are not banned from the show  nobody's banned from any show  except laszlo that's your call  what's the story with you and pat  you said that pat was full of shit  what happened there  i don't remember saying that  but ron  you're rolling 20 deep  you got to get to your show today  before we do that  can i just take a second  to talk about special delivery  sure  sure  that's a fucking show  that i hope seriously  can we go an extra night with it  because it's doing so well right now 
[00:49:30]  i mean  what are the big plans  right now we're hoping that they'll keep us on saturdays  you're kidding me  that's that's the fingers crossed  they'll keep us on saturdays  because i was talking to a couple people  and again i don't know whether you want to work it out  but special delivery in spanish could fucking work  i got friends at telemundo  really  well i could pick up a rosetta stone no problem  i don't know what that means  i could learn spanish  through rosetta stone  i don't know what a rosetta stone is  it's a language program 
[00:50:00]  and i don't get cable  i don't know how the whole thing's  hold on people are talking  what's going on  what's going on  they come out with a new cupcake  while we're doing this  i just heard them go like this  what about lavender chocolate  you know they get really all the time  they're all this like  what if there was an orange slice  on a pear slice  well that's that's why their business is successful  because they don't leave their business at the store  they are the business  i didn't think of that  but it's all about branding  yeah  yeah well that's why the ron bennington cupcake is done so well

[00:51:30]  but my  and got this  well it was actually brought here  it was a pie the other day  that was easily  from brooklyn  i don't want to promote it too much  but it was easily the best pie i've ever had in my life  and like  and i said it was a $35 pie  and people are like  although  i would pay double for this pie  this is a $70 pie  what kind of pie was it  it was actually it was called a salted  a salted honey custard pie  oh my goodness  yeah  it's very luxurious sounding 
[00:52:00]  it  it tastes like  and i don't know if this is the phrase  because i don't know how everything works here on  i know satellite you can say  but it tastes like  angel vagina  it was that good  you can say that  it was like going down on an angel  wow  i've never done that  so i'd love to experience it  you never even went down on a girl did you  no i have done that  just not an angel  whoa  i know  i know  you know what sam i'm gonna start and call you pussy liquor  okay  that's gonna be my  my  i thought sammy sweethearts were starting to take off  um  rob cross calls me sammy sweethearts in front of whoever is listening in the hallway now 
[00:52:30]  rob was bringing up some stuff to me about me and you  where he thought  really  that there was something  and you know your parents feel the same way  yeah  there's something about the chemistry that you and i have  that obviously isn't working with dave and fez  well i mean  i was thinking what about the dave and fez show  those guys always got along  one of them cried i couldn't remember which one of them got their face pushed into pizza  it's not important at this point  really it doesn't matter  but one of those guys 
[00:53:00]  i'm gonna tell a story like my mom will tell it  somebody pushed someone's face and i don't know ask your dad he knows all the things  but some one of your friends is dead from high school  my mom always give me a story like that  she's either one of the girls you dated  or your teacher  someone's dead  she sounds like she's strong with like broad outlines  but then when it comes to filling in the blanks that's not her thing  the best thing she is spreading news is she likes to dial the phone  and then from after that  everything else is all confused 
[00:53:30]  right and then  she has no problem just leaving  it's either your uncle's dad or someone  i don't know what it is  and then she passes the phone to your dad who kind of clears things up  my dad just talks about the fillings  okay  my dad's like i can't believe the lineup we have  all right  well i'll let you i mean the people are here to see the runner fed show  people are here and yesterday there was a lot of complaints about how long you went with it  yeah there was  i tried to give it back to you  uh why  again let's not point fingers  you're right  but in this case it was your fault 
[00:54:00]  you're pointing a finger right at me  and  oh mike just knocked over a cupcake plans that he has right now  those are three thousand dollar uh  no i didn't bring them  what do you bring the fourteen hundred dollar sunglasses  he goes when i travel i don't want to use the expensive sunglasses  fourteen hundred dollars for sunglasses  yeah well three thousand dollars is his normal sunglasses  for sunglasses  yeah how much does he pay for a pie  you know but see here's the thing that you don't understand sam  this  these sunglasses bring women in  really 
[00:54:30]  yeah  wow and then women buy cupcakes  forget the cupcakes  women are  something's got to pay for the sunglasses  women are women are attracted to mike and he does very very well with them  is it the sunglasses or him  i don't know i heard from a woman today she goes  i noticed that whoever you are talking to looks attractive  and i can't understand whether that's because of my glow or  i think it's your glow  it's a comparison  it's a compliment to you  but i'm trying not to get my feelings hurt  and um  loader  i call him loader  i should say his whole name is kurt loader 
[00:55:00]  Kurt loader  said the funniest thing to me today  he goes i don't know what it is man but you just keep getting funnier  and i go whatever  that's what he said  uh by the way um  bobby slayton's gonna be here in three hours  and i know that because he's lurking around the lobby now  i don't know if you know this or not man  uh but me and mitchell are doing something this saturday night  it's gonna be fucking being around  if you want to take a ride out to long island  it's all fucking locked up there i mean  we're both all cleaned up so you don't have to worry about that  i mean don't  don't even bring a change of clothes because no one's fucking sleeping 
[00:55:30]  but everything  every time that he talks to you  it seems like he's trying to make up a story for the cops  yeah  that every  like he's gotta fill the details in  he's got to get the details going  i didn't even know what happened i came home like you do  every night you're a family person so am i  but i came in there's a dead body on the floor  they always try to act like this could happen to anyone  yeah  the fucking bitch didn't wake up i didn't  i said fuck it i cleaned up the room quickly got out  i don't know what happened you've been there though you know what i'm saying
