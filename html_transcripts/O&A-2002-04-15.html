<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, establishing themselves as "radio mercenaries" unconcerned with criticism.  Studio guest Jim Norton, fresh from a comedy tour, joined them in a furious, offensive tirade against a group of parents who'd complained about the show's content and Norton's jokes, accusing the parents of negligent parenting.  Norton then recounted a racist anecdote about a cab ride.  The hosts continued their attack on the parents, inventing darkly humorous scenarios involving them and their children, and mocked a letter from a concerned parent, Brent Richards.  Their discussion included offensive jokes about the Columbine High School massacre.

A significant portion of the show focused on a listener, Rick Delgado, who, as part of a show stunt, yelled "Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on!" during Kathleen Turner's nude scene in a Broadway production of *The Graduate*.  The hosts played multiple audio recordings of the event, highlighting Delgado's actions, the audience's reaction (or lack thereof), and his ejection from the theater.  They expressed great satisfaction with the stunt and discussed future prank targets.

The show also featured several listener calls about the Kathleen Turner incident, with many offering their own experiences heckling her.  These calls, along with the hosts' and guests' comments, included sexually suggestive remarks and body-shaming insults directed at Turner.  The hosts repeatedly referred to a "Central Scrutinizer" (a theater usher) and discussed the potential legal ramifications of the prank, with Kathleen Turner's representatives reportedly angry and threatening legal action.  Several unrelated listener calls contributed to the overall chaotic and offensive tone.

Another major segment featured an in-studio interview with musical guest Andrew W.K., promoting his album "I Get Wet."  He discussed the album's controversial cover featuring real and pig's blood, its song titles ("Party Hard," "She Is Beautiful," "Party Till You Puke," etc.), his philosophy on perseverance in the music industry, and past jobs (Bergdorf Goodman, bubblegum machine salesman).  The interview was interspersed with further discussion of the Kathleen Turner incident and speculation about The Rock's sexuality based on a *Saturday Night Live* skit with Chris Kattan.

The show also included two "show us your balls" segments: one involving a listener, Brian, who announced Kevin Costner's death at the end of a *Message in a Bottle* screening, and another detailing a disastrous attempt by show staff (Ben, Rick, and Earl) to spoil *Star Wars: Episode I â€“ The Phantom Menace* for waiting fans, resulting in chaos and near-violence. Audio from both events was played. The show also satirized Tom Brokaw's retirement and Afghan F-14 flight with extensive *Top Gun* references.  Jim Brewer, a teen heartthrob, was also a guest, briefly discussing his appearance on TRL.  A promise to play Maury Povich audio about hidden midgets was made for the next show.  A phone call from a drummer, Jose, offered Andrew W.K. album cover suggestions.  A caller named Frenchie launched a profanity-laced tirade against a caller named Tom.  The show ended with further offensive jokes and celebratory comments about the Kathleen Turner prank and promotion of Brewer's Comedy Central special and Andrew W.K.'s CD.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Publicity sluts. We're artists. This is all about money. That's what it comes down to.  But you're mercenaries. Aren't you mercenaries? We're radio mercenaries, dickhead.  We're artists. We're entertainers. We're not psychologists. We're not doctors. We're not daycare workers.  We're artists. So it's all on appearance, none on you. None on us.  We're artists. The Opie and Anthony show. None on us.  And then you say it like this.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:00:30]  Go Sox!  Easy. Shut up, Ben. Easy, Ben.  That was so outside. Stop it.  That last pitch was ridiculous outside.  Sox beat the Yanks again.  Just like the government, the umps are a little corrupt up in Boston, too.  Come on, Boston. You know what I'm talking about.  Couple phone numbers in the New York area. 877-692-1027. 
[00:01:00]  Anywhere else, including Washington, D.C.  I don't know. I felt like saying it.  866-277-4WOW. That's 866-277-4WOW.  Wow.  Jim Norton in the studio back from Cleveland.  Back from his road trip.  You know, politicians flying around.  Colin Powell's going to do that little thing he's doing about trying to get peace in the Middle East.  And then our own Jim Norton, shedding all over the country, spreading his disease. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, taking my comedy too far on the road.  A little too far.  Comedy gone too far with Jim Norton.  I'm not going to comment on it.  I just read it. I just want to say, those Columbine murders were hilarious.  Oh, my God.  All those shattered dreams.  Now, Jim, I think you're going too far with your comedy here.  That's comedy gone too far.  That's comedy gone too far.  Tear-stained parental faces.  A focus group.  How about some stomach cancer for all of you?  Drop dead with your awful kids.  Ugh. 
[00:02:00]  Get your focus group and your rotten, hypersensitive children.  I just read this email, and if I had hepatitis and a squirt gun, I would blast you and your stupid kids.  I'm so tired of comedians and entertainers being blamed for your failures as parents.  I don't get any credit when these little scumbags are good math.  I don't want to take any responsibility when they put on trench coats on Hitler's birthday, which I'm glad they do.  Great point.  I don't want credit either.  I don't want credit for your children's success. 
[00:02:30]  I'm not concerned with your kids.  Jim, we needed this Friday.  I apologize.  I just read this.  I know.  We're like three days too late.  I know.  I'm not trying to get into it.  You want to explain it?  He's talking about a little letter that we got from a concerned parent.  They get together, and they talk about...  Can I read his name?  Can you give me his name?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Read my transcripts of Friday.  You'll see.  I concur.  Brent Richards, his name is.  Brent Richards.  Good old Brent.  Straighten out the community.  What an annoying dad he might be.  They get together, a bunch of parents, and they form a circle, and they discuss radio shows  like ours, and a comedy like Jim Norton's. 
[00:03:00]  It's a parents' group, so what they do is sit around and discuss things they feel affect  their lousy children.  And instead of maybe blaming themselves for their own parental inadequacies, they turn around  and blame comedy and radio shows, TV, movies, video games, everything else except the fact  that maybe their children are building bombs and planning to shoot up their school in their  garage, and they have no clue about it until it happens.  You neglectful, middle-class scumbags.  I have no mercy for any of you. 
[00:03:30]  If your kids can't handle the radio, then be firm parents and turn it off, or tell them  to pony up and get pistols.  I'm so tired, I don't care about your dumb kids.  Yes.  I just don't care about them.  Rob effing O.  Ugh.  We all sit around.  And how many of these parents, how many of you take your kids to the church regardless  of what these vultures are doing to your little boys, you dirtbags.  Worry about comedy.  Shift the blame because you're awful parents.  Ugh.  Comedy gone too far, you dirtbags.  Because the second the church is evil and bad, their whole world comes apart. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  The whole thing that holds them together and makes them think that they're raising wonderful  children because they're going to this church.  The second that comes apart and unwinds, it all comes apart.  At least after my act, the kid doesn't have his pants around his ankles doing the duck  walk, you jackasses.  Body of Jim, amen.  That's not wine and that will come out with a little club soda.  I'm supposed to be concerned. 
[00:04:30]  I don't mean to rehash it.  Comedy doesn't go far enough.  That guy is so pompous to think that he's decided how far comedy is allowed to go.  And they monitor the radio.  And if your daughter was all nervous and afraid because of what was happening during  the 50s, I can't wait to see what happens when someone takes out their mule and says,  look, do this or you're walking home.  And not only can I not wait, I hope I'm the guy that does it.  And the fact that this guy called me a pedophile and a racist, yes, you are perceptive, sir.  But it has nothing to do.  I'm not a racist, you jackass. 
[00:05:00]  I hate kids that are black, white, yellow, all of them.  All the little bastards.  I had such an annoying cat.  I don't mean to come in like, you know, a bat out of heck, huddle, huddle.  But I had to buy something.  I will get on.  I'll shut up.  Go.  No, we love this.  I had a cab ride today.  I went down to P.C.  Richard's.  I had to buy something.  Oh, my God.  An electronics component?  Yeah.  My TV came.  Wow.  My friend Jay.  You decided to start watching TV.  Good move.  My buddy, Jay.  Thank you, Jay.  I went down to P.C.  Did you hook it up to the aerial on the roof?  Oh, buddy, yours. 
[00:05:30]  And I'm in a cab coming home.  I had to buy something.  And I'm on 14th in Columbus.  That's Columbus.  Stupid.  I'm 80 blocks off.  I mean, what is 14th?  What is Union Square?  Union Square.  Yeah.  And the cabbie, I don't know what he was.  He was Malaysian or something.  I'm sorry to be a racist there, Brent.  I hope you die the day before your daughter gets married.  I hope you fall face first into the wedding cake in the dressing room. 
[00:06:00]  Just as you're about to walk her down the aisle, I hope your heart stops.  Blame-shifting bag of vomit you are.  And I'm in the cab coming back up.  And I know comedy gone too far.  Well, how about cabbies that don't know where they're going?  I was going up Park Avenue.  And I'm like, dude, because I live on the west side.  But, you know, I don't want to say where because all the gals will show up.  You know?  Give her a little tussle in the name of father and the son.  Blame-entertainment, you blame-shifting, middle-class zilches. 
[00:06:30]  It's all entertainers' fault because you have to have two cars in the garage.  Your fat wife has to work so she can feel that she has a career.  Open your legs, stupid, and clean the toilet.  That's your duty.  Let a husband go out and do his banking job or whatever it is he does.  Scumbag.  So I'm in the cab.  I'll tell the guy.  I've got to go to the west side.  I tell him where I've got to go.  And we're going up.  This is around one something.  Lunch hour.  And he's like, we're going to go right up Park Avenue.  And it took me 40 minutes to go up Park Avenue.  Oh, my God.  And over 40 seconds. 
[00:07:00]  Why didn't we just go to JFK Airport and then double back?  This scumbag.  I'm not a tourist.  I live here.  And the whole time I'm in the cab, I'm obsessed.  Turn the radio off, kids, because I'm going to say something mean.  I was obsessed with grabbing his thinning hair and biting his Malaysian ear and then just  screaming, savage, into his ear.  Into his bloody hole.  Into his bloody hole.  That used to be an ear.  I wanted to grab.  He had thinning Squiggy from Laverne and Shirley.  Oh, cancer head.  That's what I kept thinking.  His thinning 1950s. 
[00:07:30]  He had like Rumsfeld hair.  And I wanted to bite his effing ear.  I'm just kidding, kids.  I didn't mean really bite his ear.  I meant in a fun radio way.  Ha, ha, ha.  And Al Pacino's not really a Cuban drug dealer.  And you know, Marlon Brando was never really a mafia don, you dummies.  You and your dumb high school kids.  Columbine happened because of overprotective parents like yourselves forcing your kids away  from you.  Yeah.  You did it.  And turning their heads when they, because it can't possibly be my kid. 
[00:08:00]  It can't be my kid.  I'm such a great parent.  What was John Walker's favorite comedy program, huh?  What was that?  Yeah, what did he listen to when he shipped off to Afghanistan to start hating Americans?  Yeah, I'm sure it was a radio show.  It wasn't the fact that his parents were such dysfunctional pieces of crap that he left  and decided to start contributing to a war against all America.  And this guy just, and this guy, and again, I'll get off this.  Imagine, comma, if you will.  Imagine if you will.  You know you're dealing with a pompous ass when someone says, imagine if you will. 
[00:08:30]  This is not an unsolved mystery.  This is a pitiful portrait of a lame-ass low-life loser.  Imagine if you will in the Twilight Zone.  One of your young listeners, imagine if you will, one of your young listeners performing  the same violent acts on women as you profess to find funny.  You're right.  It wouldn't be funny.  I would pull down my trousers and do a little bag-whacking if I heard about that.  You'd jag off with stupid kids.  We were talking about that same line.  And if you have consenting adults and the guy says to the girl, hey, you want to get 
[00:09:00]  in a 55-gallon drum?  I'm going to dump stuff on you.  You scream a little, you know, and then I pull you out and we have some sex or something.  He has a problem with that?  Somebody doing the same thing we did here?  Did we abduct people from the streets, shove them in a barrel, and start putting food  products on them?  Contrary to my suggestion, no, you didn't.  I know, exactly.  Contrary to what we wanted to do.  The way it was presented on the air, and the way it was, was these girls came in of their 
[00:09:30]  own accord and had a great time doing it.  It was a lot of fun.  The guy doesn't seem to realize that.  He thinks we brought them in at gunpoint, again, one of Jim's suggestions, and did  this to him.  He's a low-life loser, know nothing.  And the thing, you're arguing logically, and logic does no good because what happens  is this guy and his group, they're based in dishonesty.  They're based in intellectual arrogance and blame shifting.  So you can't argue logically with a garbage like this.  They'll just shift it somewhere else. 
[00:10:00]  What I'm going to say is if you're a member of a group like this and you're doing good  things for your kids, good for you.  But if you're attacking entertainment, I hope your kids are pregnant young, and I hope they're  failures, and then you find out they don't even like this show.  And if they can't handle it, they're weak, and you're bad parents.  Jim, I think Friday, when we discussed this, was it Friday or Thursday?  It was Friday, whatever, yeah.  I recommended, or I had hoped, that as they were sitting around in their little meeting,  all their kids in the playroom, playing together, having a little play date, all their 
[00:10:30]  kids, with some wholesome stuff on the TV, and little cocktail franks, maybe, that the  wives made.  They all got together as the men talked about what was best for their kids, and comedy gone  over the line, and then the women are making iced tea for the guys, and the kids are all  playing with their toys, and a tractor trailer goes awry, plows into the house, killing everybody.  Would that just be, would that just give your heart joy? 
[00:11:00]  You know what would give my heart joy?  The look on the little puppy's face, as he just saw the wheels bouncing over the bodies.  The little puppy, all sad, he's just getting his little fur tussled a minute ago, and what  happened?  Now there's truck tire wheels.  Body, parts, and toys rolling slowly to a stop.  And you know what it would look like, the wheels bouncing?  Remember Smokey and the Bandit, when Jerry Reed runs over all the motorcycles, and the  tires were bouncing?  They just all bounced?  Yeah.  Hold on the ass, Fred, and the little old families. 
[00:11:30]  And as far as making fun of the Trade Center, you dirtbag, nobody here made fun of the Trade  Center.  We went off on that.  All right, all right.  I mean, you can say what you want about this show, whatever, but leave that alone.  Again.  People, by the way, who are the people he mentioned?  Who, who, I mean, I don't know, maybe they're very funny.  Lauren and Wally, I mean, they sound like barn-burningly funny people.  Lauren and Wally are my favorite show up in Boston.  Don't speak badly about Lauren and Wally.  I don't know if it's Lauren and Wally.  What did they say? 
[00:12:00]  The effects you're having on children, I am so, I don't care.  You know why I don't care?  I don't have kids.  You know why?  Because I blast girls on the face when I'm done.  I don't want kids.  I don't get the credit for their good deeds.  I don't want responsibility for their bad deeds.  And I don't have responsibility for their good deeds either.  I don't care if the kid's good and mad or if he knows what pi squared is or the square root of pi.  22 over 7.  Not our problem.  And I love the fact that you brought that up.  I don't have kids.  I don't want kids.  I don't want them.  I don't like them.  I don't want kids.  You know why?  Because I want to be able to say and do whatever the hell I want without having to worry about a kid. 
[00:12:30]  And your job as a parent, when you sacrifice the part of your life that includes having fun and being spontaneous and remembering what it was like to enjoy yourself before you had your children, that's what I enjoy doing.  And since you sacrificed it, it's no skin off my ass.  And it shouldn't have an effect on what people should be allowed to listen to.  So take your stupid little meeting group and, like Jim said, die. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Die a horrible, evil death.  On the eve of a child's wedding.  You're just about to walk down the aisle and your heart stops and your face goes into the wedding cake and everybody is sad.  That would never be forgotten.  I don't know.  It wouldn't be.  Every year, instead of a happy wedding dinner, there'd be a tear and a little resentment at Dad for wrecking the whole effing thing by having a selfish stroke.  That's the point.  You make me want to vomit.  That is fantastic. 
[00:13:30]  I am so unconcerned.  When was Opie and Anthony on in the early 1900s when blacks couldn't vote, you dummies, it has nothing to do with the problems.  That was us.  World War II.  Any murders that took place before our show.  All that stuff.  All us.  I'm just, I don't really, I like kids.  People always say, you don't hate kids.  I hate parents.  I have a nephew.  I love my nephew.  But you know what?  My sister's a good parent and she's divorced, but her ex is a good father.  That's why my nephew does well, because he has good parents.  It makes me want to throw up. 
[00:14:00]  What a way to start a week of radio.  Yeah.  Jim Norton back from Cleveland.  Yeah, I had a great time, by the way.  Cleveland was great, man.  We got to wrap up this little rap of yours with the Columbine song.  Oh, you got one?  Yes.  Oh, yeah, we do.  And you know what?  And fan is to those parents in Columbine.  You know, because Dylan Klebold and Eric Davis, I think Dylan was half Jewish.  And the fact that they were Hitler youth, I mean, why would that make parents suspicious?  You know, I'm sure the parents were doing a good job and it's pretty normal when your, you know,  your half Jewish son throws on a trench coat to celebrate Hitler's birthday. 
[00:14:30]  See a little phase they're going through?  Well, I'm sure everything will be fine in a couple of years.  He'll realize him and his little friends are going through a phase where they build explosives  and hoard guns to kill their playmates with.  And you know one ever murdered an animal on the air, by the way?  No, we went through that.  Yeah, we went through it.  The guy is wrong.  I banged an animal in Lancaster once and she was really a fat, awful woman.  And I happily put in her balloon knot and put her fat face in the pillow and she cried 
[00:15:00]  and she thought I loved her.  You know what?  Her dad, hopefully, is part of a parent group somewhere.  Don't worry, I'm not a pedophile.  She was 18.  Wink, wink.  I love the fact.  You're killing it.  18 years old, you can't have a drink in this country, but you can sign up and go murder  somebody in the military, which I'm all for don't get me wrong.  Oh, yeah.  But they should be able to drink while they do it.  Absolutely.  Parents suck.  All right, here's a little song from Brother Joe.  Here's Dylan, who liked an M-16 with high-capacity magazines. 
[00:15:30]  But Eric liked to build the bombs and race and all in little time.  What a crazy pair.  They were killers.  Yes, iconic villains all the way.  Shot up their school in Trench Coast one year ago today.  While Dylan faked out a jock, a spick, an effing Jew, some religious chick.  Well, Eric was out of control. 
[00:16:00]  The shotgun left some gagging holes.  What a couple of pricks.  They were killers.  Yes, iconic villains that you'll find.  They walked the leg.  They walked the leg.  It must have been wound up too tight.  And they took their own lives.  They were killers.  They were killers.  Who's that Columbine?  Ah.  Yes.  All right.  Madcap humor.  Is that what you want?  A little madcap humor? 
[00:16:30]  Did you read that?  Yeah.  He says, you know, the madcap humor is okay.  I have an idea for some madcap humor.  How about we take your wife and we shove a horn in her seat and then we punch her stomach  and it goes, wah, wah.  Yeah.  Poof.  I hope you grow up and your womb is barren.  Wow.  Hey, look at that.  Was that hurt in a theater?  Why don't you stick up Red Skelton and eat his ass?  I don't think.  Oh, God. 
[00:17:00]  I don't know if you can say that.  Red Skelton.  Leave Red Skelton alone.  I have nothing.  No problem.  Red Skelton.  And who would want to do that to Red?  That's madcap, though.  It is.  Maybe just like the old hobo.  You know, years ago, comedians didn't have to curse to be funny.  You know what else they didn't know years ago?  Fly from coast to coast in six hours.  It took 12 days.  A lot of things they didn't do years ago.  Stupid.  Like live past the age of 40.  Then again, that's stupid because Bob Hope is old.  I really should shut my ass.  That's stupid.  One step too far.  All right. 
[00:17:30]  Everyone was on my side.  And then me and my meat breasts have to push it one step too far.  And I lose everyone.  That's it.  Then lips keep talking.  Oh, that Brent is right.  I'd like to give him a kiss right on his mouth.  Why are you kissing my father against his will?  Because I can.  Yeah, and I love concerned parents.  You know what I love about concerned parents when they go to hockey games together?  That's what I love.  Oh, my God.  Hey, my son wants to play hockey.  Mine too.  All right.  Well, you're dead and I'm going to jail.  Good. 
[00:18:00]  I hope they were part of a focus group for parents.  It was radio or TV that made him do that.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  And the fact that it was just a big dope.  Oh, wow.  Two concerned fathers.  You know, hey, my kid's better than yours.  Why couldn't they just be like normal parents and go into the bathroom and make a little comparison  and tussle each other's hair and laugh it off?  Hey, loser buys the winner a beer.  Little helmet jousting.  Tug chug.  Hey, we look at our kids' pictures.  We don't make eye contact because we live for them, don't we?  Come on.  You put your kid in the bag.  I put mine. 
[00:18:30]  We all have fun.  We switch stalls midway through.  Hey, you have an Asian kid.  Too bad.  Clinkle clinkle.  Sorry, I didn't mean to be racist.  All right, we got lots to do today on the show.  Hell yeah.  I mean, a lot of things to do.  Some interesting email coming in, Anthony.  Yes, yes.  I believe some radio show is mentioning something about us, I think.  Something like that.  Is that what you're hearing, really?  Yeah, it's one thing I'm hearing.  Let me go to Travis. 
[00:19:00]  Travis, what's going on, bro?  What's up, ONA?  Hey.  Norton's going nuts today.  Yeah, he's on fire, man.  Looks like he got a good night's sleep, finally.  All right, so listen.  I'm listening to a specific, quote-unquote, radio show today.  Yep.  And in the news, they're talking about The Graduate.  That would be the play on Broadway.  Yes.  With Kathleen Turner.  With Kathleen Turner.  In the role of Mrs. Robinson.  So they're in the news, and he's like, and so get this.  Someone gets up in the middle, as soon as you drop the towels and yells, put that thing 
[00:19:30]  back on.  I believe it was Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on.  Is that what the quote was?  I believe that was the quote, if I'm not mistaken.  I think we could rewind.  I mean, I mean, I mean, that's what I'm hearing.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Do you have that on the cart?  Oh.  Do you need to load that up?  I guess everyone is reporting that someone stood up at The Graduate on Broadway and told  Kathleen Turner to put her goddamn clothes on. 
[00:20:00]  Interesting.  It was, and they also mentioned, you know, yeah, it was, I guess some radio show had  a contest that did this.  I believe it was a contest.  He knows exactly what the details were.  He knows who it was.  All right.  Thank you, Travis.  All right.  Take care of yourself.  All right.  I want to see Jim Brewer Friday.  All right.  UNH.  All right.  Thanks.  Where's that?  University of New Hampshire?  Oh, I was just going to give, like, three more letters.  P-L-D.  Right.  What?  UNH, HIV.  John from Broadway. 
[00:20:30]  Friday night at The Graduate, someone stood up and yelled, Kathleen, put your damn clothes  back on.  Joe from Manhattan.  I was at The Graduate Friday night.  Oh, my God.  I thought it was funny until I was actually in the seat.  My girlfriend looked at me like I did it.  Oh, he was at that show?  Wow.  Yeah.  A bunch of radio stations talking about a guy that was shouting at Kathleen during The Graduate  to put her clothes back on, inspired by a pair of radio DJs. 
[00:21:00]  It goes on and on.  Well, maybe that person will be calling us today, Anthony.  I'd love to hear that audio.  What audio?  There's no audio?  I assumed maybe someone would send in some audio.  Well, why don't we take a break and let's see if we can get to the bottom of this, Anthony.  All right.  Let's do that.  Oh, fuck.  What country are you from?  Uh, what?  What ain't no country I ever heard of.  They speak English and what? 
[00:21:30]  Uh, what?  English, mother...  Do you speak it?  Yeah.  Then you know what I'm saying.  Uh, what?  Say what again?  Say what again?  I dare you.  I double dare you, mother...  Say what?  One more...  Uh...  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  What?  Yeah, yeah.  Destroy.  Destroy.  Ah!  But much?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Da-da-doo.  Da-da-doo.  Da-da-doo. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  And we are proud to say...  Mission accomplished.  Mission accomplished.  Mission accomplished.  Da-da-doo.  Da-da-doo.  Yeah.  What was the mission we were trying to accomplish, Anthony?  The mission.  To have somebody...  It was an inside job!  To have somebody go to see the Broadway production of The Graduate. 
[00:22:30]  Starring Kathleen Turner as Mrs. Robinson with Alicia Silverstones in it.  Jason Biggs.  And Jason Biggs.  And at one point...  Well, we discussed the play.  It all started with Steve from foundrymusic.com.  He saw it.  Saw the play last weekend and went, ooh, what a horrific sight where Kathleen Turner took her clothes off.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, I guess if you're doing theater or a movie or something, you've got to be believable.  But no one's buying that Jason Biggs is going to fall for a naked Kathleen Turner. 
[00:23:00]  No, no.  Steve went on to say that the sight was horrific.  Yeah, he didn't think that a naked linebacker was good up on stage like that to look at.  So he gave the play a little review.  And we suggested perhaps somebody should have the balls and go down to Broadway and stand up just as Kathleen drops her clothes.  Yeah.  And scream out for the whole audience to hear, Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on. 
[00:23:30]  That person will win a fine prize from the Opie and Anthony show.  Then it got really interesting because Kathleen Turner's people were calling like crazy and they wanted to sue you and I, Anthony.  I know.  I don't know what the charge would be, but they wanted to sue us.  I don't know.  Oh, you didn't know that, Jim?  No.  Yeah, they wanted to sue us.  So are we interrupting a performance or I don't know what the charge was?  I don't know what it is, but we made it so it wasn't a contest anymore.  That's the one concession we made.  Well, that was the promise we made to Super GM Ken Stevens.  Right.  So then we went on the radio and said that we just need a couple tickets to see The Graduate on Broadway. 
[00:24:00]  A couple of tickets.  Just a couple of tickets.  Everyone was starting to get a little suspicious.  Yep.  Even the people down there on Broadway.  So Ann and I went on the air and said, well, you know, something's going to happen next week, meaning this week.  Right.  Wrong Friday night, baby.  It was that night.  Right.  Friday night.  Friday night's production of The Graduate.  We had somebody.  Somebody.  We had so many people at the show, it wasn't even funny.  We got three different recordings. 
[00:24:30]  Yes.  Well, we wanted to be sure that they wouldn't be able to grab the perp.  Right.  And take his tape.  We needed other people there.  We had three people at The Graduate Friday night, and only one person wants his name known.  The other two want to remain nameless, I should say.  Nameless.  Nameless.  Yes.  Remain nameless.  That person who went down there Friday night with two other guys, Rick Delgado. 
[00:25:00]  Rick.  Rick was there.  He was one of the plants that were just there to monitor the situation, not to become involved.  I was the techie on site.  And you were also loaded up with a device.  Mic'd and ready.  Very good.  A triangulation, a crossfire.  In total, I believe we had four recording devices.  That's the rumor.  Yeah, yeah.  And we got three that worked.  No one sits near each other. 
[00:25:30]  No one acknowledges each other's existence.  It's very, very difficult to figure out what's going on.  And if I might add at this moment, this isn't the end of this bit.  No.  No.  This isn't the end of this bit.  No.  This is our little way of taking these Hollywood elite and giving them a little dose.  Right.  Giving them a little bit back.  And I think you're going to be seeing this very situation happening at many of the Broadway theaters here in Manhattan. 
[00:26:00]  I cannot wait for the next one.  I already got a line on a play that is just going to be horrific when somebody stands up and says what I'm thinking.  Yeah.  Now, I'm very surprised that the person that stood up.  You'll be dreaming that it was only a cell phone ringing in the audience.  I'm surprised.  You're all upset they get when that happens.  Oh, forget about it. 
[00:26:30]  I'm surprised the person that stood up and said, Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes on, doesn't want to take credit for this.  I know.  On this Monday afternoon.  You know, this person so wanted to take credit, was jazzed about it.  We celebrated afterwards with beers.  And all of a sudden, by last night, he's calling me a little nervous.  This morning, even more nervous.  And, you know, unfortunately, he can't step away.  He called me before the show, and we decided not to answer any phones. 
[00:27:00]  You know what?  We didn't want anyone raining on our parade today.  I'll take credit.  I wasn't going to.  No.  Shut up, sir.  I wish I had the balls to do that.  That's just hilarious.  That's amazing.  Matt, what's going on?  Nothing much.  I just wanted to know if Rick walked in there in a big red pinstripe suit like the score.  You guys had this ridiculously.  Yeah, we wanted it set up so that it was pretty fail-safe.  You know what I mean?  We had some expendable people.  Yeah.  If something happened, we had our redundancies and backup plans. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, because our biggest worry was that we would pull this damn thing off, and they would catch the person that is recording it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was not going to happen to us today.  We didn't want that happening, so people were scattered around the theater with no contact with each other.  That's the best thing, because they can't then throw everybody out.  I got to be honest.  I got no mercy for the actors, because comedians put up with this every day. 
[00:28:00]  Obnoxious patrons try doing that while people are being sat and drinking and smoking.  You usually have it perfect.  One little heckle, and it ruins you.  I just love being a hair of people's ass.  I love it, and I love the fact that we can annoy people like this.  Oh, yeah.  It's great.  It's a little bit of the unexpected chaos thrown into your effing lives.  Every time she takes her clothes off now for the rest of this run, she's going to be thinking about it.  Oh, she's going to be thinking about it.  It's kind of scary that this worked out so perfectly, Anthony.  And it only encourages us to do it more.  Yeah, there were things going on in the bathroom. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, yeah.  The bathroom that we felt like two idiotic James Bonds trying to set the recorder.  Yeah.  It's an old-fashioned toilet.  You can hang the recorder behind it.  Behind it.  And then on the other side, so I'm in the middle stall.  I got people on either stall on the side of me.  We're trying to get a recorder set, because I'm the only one that knew how to turn these things on,  and we don't want to turn them on too early to waste, you know, batteries.  Make sure that recorder's behind there. 
[00:29:00]  I don't want him coming out of that bathroom with his s**t in his hand.  Exactly.  After you record it, I want you to drop the recorder down on the ground.  Don't look no one in the eyes, but don't look away neither.  Ah, you're going to do all right, kid.  I'm going to be scared stiff of you.  I kept it loud to scare away any pain in the ass innocent vice-danners.  Hey, leave the TiVo. Take the cannoli.  Ah, Brian.  Hey, guys, what's going on?  Hey. 
[00:29:30]  I'm starting to get a little scared of you guys.  Why?  Because this is like some fight club stuff here.  You've got like a bunch of different people working together.  They don't even know they're there, though.  Get a little scary.  It's true.  It had to be organized in a way that everybody was working independent for the same goal.  We don't mess around.  And then we had people on the outside waiting for phone calls.  Waiting for the drop.  His name was Opie and Anthony.  The screaming.  I started screaming when I got the call. 
[00:30:00]  Mission accomplished.  Oh, I know.  You guys are great.  Norton, you're awesome.  Thanks, buddy.  Ray called me up and said it went down.  And I asked him, is this a test, sir?  Opie called me in Cleveland in between shows.  He was so happy.  Oh, yeah.  The phones were ringing like crazy.  And I go, Jim, you've got to do the show a favor.  Because you had two shows in Cleveland.  I go, you've got to announce to the show in Cleveland that mission was accomplished.  And one thing I will say, I did say the guy's name to Cleveland.  So if any of you remember, don't say it when you call in.  That's all right.  I just say, you know, they went nuts. 
[00:30:30]  Ah, this person will come forward eventually.  He's just a little nervous.  He's not used to this type of heat.  I know.  But when he comes in here, I'm going to just grab his hand and give his hair a little tussle.  A little tussle.  If that person is listening, this is no worse than the time we had a guy hold up the C word on live TV.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  He came forward eventually.  Come on in.  Bad bags are on the house.  I'm just glad my phone call to you guys wasn't from the back of a patrol car.  No. 
[00:31:00]  I was assing it.  There is nothing these people can do.  You were the safest.  Nothing these people can do.  I guess so.  But still, you know.  But you get paranoid in that situation.  Like, I know they're on to me.  They had no clue.  Nothing these people can do.  And this reign of terror on Broadway is going to continue.  And if you could be arrested for heckling, you know how happy comics would be that we could have these dirtbags yanked out in handcuffs?  Right.  Exactly.  Dave, what's going on?  This is no conference.  Yeah, what's up, Bobby?  Hey, Dave.  Let's go.  I can just fix you in the shower and listen to, like, finding out and going, like, good fellas. 
[00:31:30]  Like the Lufthansa.  I can't do it.  Security.  You're looking at it.  That was Mike Starr.  I did an episode of Ed with him, and I kept doing good fellas quotes, and he wanted to punch me in my weak chin.  All right, Dave.  Hey, Opie.  Did you have any recordings of, like, popcorn crunching and anything like that?  No, there's no popcorn crunching on a Broadway.  This is not what's happening, sir, where reruns going to drop the recorder, and I'm going to jail for a fat kid eating popcorn. 
[00:32:00]  At a Doobie Brothers show.  That's believable.  The gang from the hood going to see the Doobie Brothers.  What was the song they were singing?  Actually, it was, uh, was it?  No, I don't think it was China Grove.  I think it was, uh, What a Fool Believes.  Yes.  It was?  Was it China Grove?  That's David Bowie.  David Bowie. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, okay.  That song stinks.  And so does Let's Dance.  Minute bomb, minute bomb, minute bomb.  All right, Ed, what's going on?  How you doing, guys?  Hey, I wanted to know if it was true if the second recorder was hidden in the grassy knoll.  The first thing I thought of, Zapruder, the Knicks film, and there was a third footage taken of the Kennedy assassination.  All right, well, you'll be able to tell when you hear this audio, but basically we had two people with recording devices very close to the stage.  Yeah.  Within, uh, how many rows? 
[00:33:00]  Um, within about ten rows of each other, you know, about ten rows back on the stage.  Yeah, yeah.  And then you'll hear another, uh, version of it from, like, very far away.  The backup recorder.  Wow.  The first rule about The Graduate, you don't talk about The Graduate.  That's from Tim in D.C.  All right, which one do you want to hear first?  Do you want to hear the one from, um, way out in the audience?  Um, yeah.  All right, let's, we'll go with this.  Is this the one where you hear, oh, yeah, you hear a woman gasp? 
[00:33:30]  You hear a woman gasp.  We thought there'd be more of a reaction.  Yeah, you know what it was?  The, uh, the audience, I, I could, and I could tell this to the uptight people sitting there, don't look at him, don't say anything, it might be a terrorist.  Like, they don't, they're just sitting there like it didn't happen.  They are just sitting in that audience, it gets yelled at, it's so plain and clear, and they just, mm-hmm, I'm not looking.  We've all been in that uncomfortable situation, and you're just thinking in your head, make it go away, make it go away, make it stop, make it stop. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, did I just hear that?  The, the silence after he yells it is, is almost as horrific as if they were just, oh, my God.  But that one woman, you just hear going, well, the one other thing, too, uh, they stopped the play for a couple seconds.  They, they, and then they just kept on going, right?  Jason Biggs and Kathleen Turner stopped dead for about one and a half seconds, took a pause, and then continued on.  They, they didn't acknowledge it at all.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, and by the way, Kathleen has, uh, cleaned up the area, by the way. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, she did?  Yeah, I think on Steve's advice.  Oh, no, is she, what's she sporting?  Landing strip.  She's sporting a landing strip now?  Wait, get Steve in here real fast.  Oh, my, because Steve said it was just a big, bushy mess.  It was a pool rack.  And the fact that, uh, there's media listening and stuff, and they're talking about this, I mean, you know, the fact that Jim Norton stood up and did that has nothing to do with the qualities.  And he's, that's how it's going to be reported.  What?  It's not Jim Norton.  So what?  Nobody wants to admit that Jim Norton did that. 
[00:35:00]  Steve C., yeah, what's up?  Uh, when you saw Kathleen Turner naked in The Graduate, what was she sporting?  Uh, big, bushy, unkempt afro.  Really?  Yeah.  One of those thigh-to-thigh numbers?  Yeah, just about thigh-to-thigh.  I mean, it's like, that's bigger than even an area.  Like, there's the area, and even if the area is completely covered, where you're like, wow, that's 70s style, it still isn't as big as the thigh-to-thigh, where it's like, that's bigger than the whole area. 
[00:35:30]  It's like a relief mat.  Yeah, just kind of, you get the mountainous area, and then it goes to foothills.  Hey, you get the foothills here.  Your meat curtains look like Juan Epstein.  All right.  So she shaved it down.  Well, how about that?  Landing strip.  Well, congrats.  God bless her.  By the way, this is called throwing you off.  We're not waiting until 520 to play this.  No.  There's reasons why we're not waiting.  Anyway, so, uh...  Oh, God, Ray from NYU, that's a good target, too. 
[00:36:00]  What?  I won't say it, but, um...  Let me see, let me see.  This one.  Another target?  She's, uh...  Ah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on, dude.  Think of things you can say for her.  That would be good.  Yeah.  And she's, uh...  Dressed a little racy, too.  You know what I mean?  If you know what I mean.  Right? 
[00:36:30]  All right, let's get to this.  Oh.  So, uh...  The scene, uh...  Approaches.  Everyone's getting the butterflies in the stomach.  Mm-hmm.  Kathleen, um...  Drops what?  A robe or...?  Uh, a towel.  A towel, and she has completely full frontal nudity.  Full frontal.  They lower the lights in the theater, so you really don't have a clear, spot-lit view  of the damage that is Kathleen Turner's, but you see her.  Okay.  All right, and here's, uh...  Said person who wants to remain nameless. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, jeez, this is really gonna be nameless one.  Shh, shh.  All right, shut up.  Shut up!  I'm not saying...  Oh, yeah.  Like, come on!  Come on.  Oh, please.  Cats and hats.  A lot of our listeners are stupid, Anthony.  All right.  This is, uh, from way back in the theater.  Just to give you a nice perspective between the two.  Here we go.  All right.  We're on the bed.  Okay.  We're on the bed.  Okay.  We're on the bed. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, my God.  Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on.  I want you to know that I'm a man.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  The other woman gasping.  Oh, no.  Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on. 
[00:38:00]  That made me cringe for it.  Isn't that horrid?  Oh.  Oh, you just know everyone's sweating.  And that's like a knife in her older belly, too.  Oh.  All I'll say is, uh, this person that had this recorder was very nervous, and they were trying  to get it out of their pockets just to get a nice, clean recording.  Shifting zilch.  Damn thing almost fell on the floor with the batteries popping out.  I gotta hear that again.  Oh.  Oh, God.  Okay. 
[00:38:30]  It's on the bed.  Whoa.  This drums.  Oh, my God.  Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on.  Oh.  I want you to say something, but I'll...  Jesus Christ.  I want you to know that I'm a man.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Oh, God damn.  Oh.  And is it possible to point out that the next time you do stuff like this, you don't do 
[00:39:00]  it on a Friday, you dumbasses, where if you get arrested, you get out Monday.  You do it on a Tuesday.  Well, we had to do it on a Friday.  It was very...  I had to throw everybody off.  It was very important.  They're prepared for this week, Jim.  Just thinking about my pals.  Time-sensitive.  All right, so now here's the same line.  I like how the mystery heckler is on a first-name basis with Kathleen Turner.  Hey, Kathleen.  Hey. 
[00:39:30]  Yo, Kathy.  Hey, Kat.  Now we go ten rows from the stage, Anthony.  Yeah.  Right from the shirt pocket of the person that said it.  Oh, no, this is the close one.  Listen to this.  No, no, no.  That's not from the shirt pocket.  Oh, this is...  That's...  There's a couple rows.  That was the...  Okay, all right.  Oh, okay.  Let's just say this is a little closer to the stage.  All right.  A lot closer to the stage.  Oh, my God.  Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on. 
[00:40:00]  Wow.  Now, that's a different woman gasping.  Oh, my God.  Oh, is that horrid?  Boy, did he...  I am so, like...  I got that embarrassing feeling.  He belted that out perfectly.  Oh, my God.  You hear the voice?  What diction he had?  Kathleen.  Yeah, you can almost hear him go, comma. 
[00:40:30]  What if thou putteth thine clothes back on?  Goddamn, Gielgud.  Good heckle.  That was perfect.  I'm glad...  Gielgud.  I won't say his name, but I'm glad he's my friend.  All right.  And look at...  You're a little more right than I thought, Opie.  Huh.  People now saying, it's awesome, Garrett.  Mm-mm.  Dude.  Because I can hear, hi, Kathleen.  Put your goddamn clothes back on.  Hi, Stinky Garrett. 
[00:41:00]  Awesome.  Could you put your clothes back on?  You want to get high?  You do not look awesome naked.  And if that's not good enough...  Yes.  Now we have a recording right from the shirt pocket of the person that stood up and said,  Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on at the Graduate Friday night.  And you can really appreciate how loud he said this when you get the recording that was  right on him.  It's horrific.  And here you go. 
[00:41:30]  Okay.  It's on the bed.  Oh, God.  This is wrong.  Oh, my God.  Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on.  What?  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  There was a bunch of gash.  Oh, you just hear like the silent little...  Oh, God.  Jesus.  He was no more than, what, 20, 25 feet away from her at that point? 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, about that.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my dear sweet God.  Right from his shirt pocket.  Oh, is that horrible?  Dude, not only that, but he stood up.  Yeah, you hear like...  Oh, yeah, you hear ruffling.  You hear him stand up and the microphone in his pocket.  When he stands up and yells it.  Okay.  It's on the bed.  Oh, God.  Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, God, it's horrible.  I want you to know.  Oh, holy Jesus.  Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on.  Like he's pissed.  Put your goddamn clothes back on.  The prison guard in Clockwork Orange did not speak as loudly and clearly as he did when  he shouted at him.  That's how loud.  Kathleen!  What's...  Kathleen! 
[00:43:00]  Kathleen!  Put your goddamn clothes back on.  Hey, I'm over here.  I'm here.  God damn it.  God damn it.  Put your goddamn clothes back on.  We have three more clips, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  So, there you go.  You get...  You know, we got to play them again.  Because now you got to hear the contrast back to back to back.  And the gasp from different parts of the room.  Yeah. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  All right, this is from far away again.  As the person tries to get the recording device out of his pocket.  Listen.  Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on.  You hear the...  When he was holding that one, Fredo had an easier time with the gun than you did with  the recorder.  Oh, man. 
[00:44:00]  Nice.  Holy jeez.  Perfect.  So, that's far away.  You can act like a man.  Let's fuck him out of here.  You know what would have been perfect after that?  You should have yelled, Papa!  Papa!  So, that's from very far away.  Here's closer to the stage.  Oh, my God.  Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on.  Poor gasp.  And finally, from the pocket of the guy who said it.  Okay. 
[00:44:30]  It's on the bed.  Oh, God.  It just rocks.  Oh.  Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on.  Huddle, huddle.  I'm all hot.  I'm all, like, hot listening to this.  I can't listen.  It's your head itching.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like all prickly.  Yeah.  Oh.  I want to run away.  Yeah.  All right.  It gets better.  So, this person. 
[00:45:00]  No, I got it.  I got it.  I got it, Rick.  So, this person does it and sits back down and just, you know, he's going to try to enjoy  the rest of the show.  Right.  Well, a little bouncer, a little Broadway bouncer came up to him.  Well, yeah.  Yeah, the usher.  Did he dance up?  Six.  Six.  He looked like a football player, didn't he? 
[00:45:30]  You're going to have to leave.  You're going to have to leave.  Hello, my baby.  Hello, my honey.  Hello, my ragtime gal.  Get your ass out of the sea.  Now, obviously, what you don't see by listening to this tape is this person.  You are Renee Holt tonight.  This person having a major confrontation with the usher.  Right.  And then he's trying to talk to the people around him.  When you're a dick, you're a dick all the way. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  So, he's just making a scene around him.  Yeah.  Trying to show all the people around him how pissed off he is that he didn't know that  Kathleen was going to be naked in this play.  Oh, he's not giving up yet.  So, listen to this.  You'll hear a lot of whispering, but it's this guy and the usher.  Right.  The usher who's like 6'3", 250.  Huge guy.  Oh, I just got to spend here to show a few while.  This is obviously right after he did it.  Right.  Within, I don't know, 30 seconds tops.  This place is terrible. 
[00:46:30]  Yes.  That's him, like, talking to a person he doesn't know right next to him.  And the person is like, shut up.  I don't want to be a soldier.  They're shocked.  Yeah, right.  I think that's kind of advice.  Dickies.  I don't want to say, when does...  What?  She's not at least now.  It's offensive.  You shouldn't...  No, I'm not going to get out.  No.  I think this is offensive.  Then get out of the theater and I'll give you a refund. 
[00:47:00]  Now he goes, get out of the theater and I'll give you a refund.  Get out of the theater.  Do you think it's offensive?  Get out of the theater and I'll give you a refund.  Just like...  It's necessary for her to take her clothes off.  I'm offended.  Come this way, please.  Come this way.  Come this way.  They like each other.  I'm sure.  Oh, we found each other.  We certainly did.  I share about this film, but not yet to go home.  Do you hear that?  What did he just say there?  It's really hard to hear, but he's saying, if I have to, I will physically remove you.  He says, if I have to remove you physically, I will. 
[00:47:30]  If I have to remove you physically, I will.  He's got to whisper because, you know, there's been enough disruption in the program already.  And how do you not get a rod when a man's saying that to you?  I double dare you, sir.  Double dog dare you.  Listen closely.  It's really hard to hear, but you might pick it up.  We found each other.  We certainly did.  I can't believe I have to take her out.  But not yet to go home.  Ben, just go with me, please.  Can you take me out physically?  Ben, I just can't be seen you, Ben.  On what basis? 
[00:48:00]  Good night, Kyle.  You have to start making everyone else's work.  Ben, the guy took us away.  I just want to give it to myself.  Ben, it's a part of the car.  Why does she have to be naked?  I just want to give it to myself.  I just want to give it to myself.  All right, let's go.  I want a refund.  This is ridiculous.  I want a refund.  The ticket was given to the son of a bitch.  And he wants a refund.  Dude, this whole thing has a great ending.  Trust me.  I want a refund. 
[00:48:30]  Did he hear the whole thing?  He's like, well, if you're offended, then get up and I'll give you a refund.  I'll refund your ticket.  But I can't believe she's naked.  That's not the point.  That's not the point.  That bouncer's never had to say anything to anyone in there.  No.  Except maybe to turn off your cell phone.  All right.  So now he decides, all right, I'm going to go get a refund.  That's right.  I need to leave.  So now you've got to picture this.  He's leaving the row and he's pretty much talking to everyone on the way out of the row. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, on the way out now he's talking to the people that are sitting on the aisle who are just horrified  and not making an ounce of eye contact with him.  Mad man.  They don't want to acknowledge this guy again.  Yeah.  It's like when you see a kid come out of the confessional, you just don't want to know.  You just look straight at him.  No questions.  I know you're crying.  You must have felt guilty.  It was your fault.  All right.  Let's duck walk you back to the car.  All right, here he goes as he leaves his row. 
[00:49:30]  This person has got to come forward so we can talk to him about all this.  This way?  Yeah.  Ridiculous.  There's no reason for her to be naked.  I can't believe you people watch this.  This is ridiculous.  This is ridiculous.  This offense is not necessary for her to be naked. 
[00:50:00]  Now, you get a picture.  He's not talking to himself.  He's talking to people around him.  No one is acknowledging that he's talking to them.  That's very, very angry.  It's ridiculous nonsense.  That is not going to let you do this.  Can I get a picture?  Now, I'm assuming you're outside the actual theater in the ticket area? 
[00:50:30]  This particular person, yeah.  Now he's out where you get the tickets.  Out by the street area.  Right.  And he's getting his refund.  Right.  Listen to this.  For the ticket that was given to him.  And listen to how his balls expand.  Listen to this.  He gets even ballsier.  Right.  Listen to this.  You hear that, right?  Yeah.  Give him his money.  Can you refund this gentleman his money?  Plus the ticket master service charge.  Wow.  Oh, my God. 
[00:51:00]  The massive set of balls.  He gets the refund.  He wants the ticket master service charge.  I got to hear that again.  Bravissimo.  One of the best performances on Broadway.  That is Tony Award winning.  Plus the ticket master service charge.  We can only give you the refund of the ticket.  Right.  All right.  Fine.  Ridiculous.  I mean, I don't know. 
[00:51:30]  Don't you think there should be some disclaimer about the nudity?  I mean, that's ridiculous.  It's unnecessary.  People should be ashamed of yourself.  Have a nice evening.  No.  You have a nice evening.  Expensive.  There you go.  Out onto the street.  The ticket master, sir, charge.  And he played that so perfectly.  Yeah.  Because if you were laughing and goofing, they would have been really, but they're like,  all right, we got a religious nut.  Yeah, right. 
[00:52:00]  He's a freak.  Right.  Exactly.  And he won't come back.  And what are you going to arrest them?  They thought he was Brent.  I happen to have young children.  Well, that went so well that I wouldn't be surprised if we see something like this happen again.  One more clip.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's walking down the street and he's still taking parting shots.  Nobody turned around.  Nobody said a goddamn thing.  F***ing wimps.  Theater goers are fags. 
[00:52:30]  Because no one said anything.  No one said anything to them.  They got a couple of gasps or something, but there wasn't the real anger from the crowd.  Like, why don't you just sit down and shut up?  That's amazing.  You got someone the first, you asked for it, and boom, it happened.  That's it.  I can only imagine.  Like, I'm thinking of the shows on Broadway and some of the people that are on Broadway right now  and some of the lines that could just be shouted out, and I'm dying here.  Incidentally, couldn't old Jim Norton's pals ONA have said, 
[00:53:00]  interrupt this Cleveland show by running up and giving them a hummer?  That would have been a nice thing to do.  You had a good enough time.  Oh, those guys.  I think this starts a new bit on the show, though, eh?  Yeah.  The whole Broadway thing, and maybe we'll expand it to pretty much do show us your balls.  Show us your balls.  Show us your balls.  Yeah.  That could mean just about anything, right, Ant?  It's pretty ballsy, what you just heard there.  Show us your balls. 
[00:53:30]  She's going to sue.  And bring us the tape.  Yep.  Isn't that amazing?  That's the best they can do, is you're going to sue?  I'll sue.  I was very embarrassed sitting there, and a gentleman was yelling at Kathleen to put her  goddamn clothes on.  I fell off of my chair.  My glasses broke, and my shoes fell off.  Should I bring my glasses and my liposuction?  I was horrified.  Mike.  Yo.  Hey, Mike.  What's up, man?  What's happening?  What's up?  Listen, I was watching the NBC News earlier about lunchtime, and they were showing how 
[00:54:00]  she was doing that stage thing and everything, and they said, watch tonight for shocking shouts  from the audience.  You know, I put two and two together, and this is what I'm coming up with.  Hmm.  You're the only person calling saying that you saw that, though.  Yeah, I'd say between 12 and 12.30, you know, I was watching the afternoon news, and just  a little preview came on in the commercial.  How big a boy are you down there, sir?  What's that?  All right, Mike.  Thank you. 
[00:54:30]  Norton sucks my mule.  Oh, there you go.  True.  Yeah, right.  Norton comment.  Make a promise and hang up, you.  Well, a lot of people are talking about this today, so maybe.  Great.  Maybe it'll make TV.  Who knows?  Who knows?  It will.  We'll see.  All right.  Wow.  But there it is.  Mission Impossible.  Multiple agents.  Operation Mayhem.  Speaking of show us your balls, we got to take a break, though.  We got two other examples of this, of showing us your balls.  We had one of our listeners go to a movie theater. 
[00:55:00]  Remember that, Ant?  Oh, yeah.  And we got to break out the most famous clip from our show where we ruined the plot line  of the last Star Wars movie.  Unfortunately, we don't have an unedited version of that, huh?  What do you mean?  It's all curses?  Well, it's all bleat, because we didn't ruin the movie.  We didn't want to wreck the movie for everyone else.  We just wanted to wreck it for the geeks.  Ah, but now we can't play it now?  Yeah, because we never saved the other.  It doesn't matter.  It's still pretty funny, because they're all double par.  It's a whole story that we could get into next.  It's really, really funny. 
[00:55:30]  All right?  All right.  A lot of people are guessing who the mystery man is.  Anyone get it?  A few people, yeah.  Quite a few people.  I bet they're all from Cleveland.  But if I ring the bell, if I ring the bell, then people that ask me to ring the bell,  it's this person, and it's wrong.  So I'm not ringing any bells.  Ben is saying 95% of them got it?  No.  Stinky Garrett.  Hey, Rick.  Why don't you call this person?  Steve C.  He really needs to reconsider.  He needs to get on the air today.  No, it was not.  It's a huge story. 
[00:56:00]  It's huge.  Mike DiNicola?  Someone's saying it's Mike DiNicola.  Why?  He didn't fumble nervously through it.  No, it wasn't Norris, the mini-wheat.  Norris, the mini-wheat, though.  I did see his picture of his body on SNL this weekend.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Well, we got to go.  Yeah, we got to take a break.  We got plenty of stuff to talk about today.  Yeah.  It's a banner day.  Hey, Kathleen, put your dryer door on.  No, not thoughts. 
[00:56:30]  I saw Kathleen Turner, and I'm dodging her.  But this made this person a made man, as far as our show goes.  Oh, in the Opie and Anthony Mafia.  Oh, without a doubt.  Made man.  He is so in now.  Now no one touches him.  People will remember this for the next five years.  So this person has to come forward.  Ah, Jimmy!  Hey, look, man.  I felt like doing it, so I did it.  And that Jim Norton.  You tool. 
[00:57:00]  One reporter had to hear that.  This guy is a made man?  No, though.  He is a made man.  Put him over the top.  Yeah.  He's kind of on the outer circle, but not no more.  Opie, I'm the dick.  Anthony, I'm an ass.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Why are you wasting your time with this sleazy trash?  People are starting to say funniest radio ever, so don't wreck it. 
[00:57:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show, 1027, WNEW.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  A little taste of Godsmack.  I stand alone from the Scorpion King soundtrack.  The Scorpion King.  That movie's going to blow, by the way.  The Rock says, it's going to blow.  Going to have a lot of action.  No storyline whatsoever.  The acting's going to be mediocre at best.  And Anthony thinks The Rock is gay. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm actually, yeah, The Rock is gay.  That's what I think.  Anybody that watched Saturday Night Live this weekend ain't going to tell me any different.  Remember, Anthony said, hey, it's perfectly okay if you want to live that lifestyle.  I got no problem.  The Rock.  Go ahead.  Is gay.  Be gay, man.  No, I don't give a flying F.  I just don't want the guy to come in here and beat me up for something you said.  Well, I was watching SNL.  Yeah, call me a puss. 
[00:58:30]  Over the M.  I was watching SNL over the weekend.  And The Rock was hosting.  And there were a couple of skits where he's dressed like a woman.  He's got...  Norton grunts with pleasure.  Pleasure for Norton to think of The Rock on this Anthony Opian.  So they had The Rock.  At one point, he's in a little miniskirt where, like, his yam bag is ready to just fall out. 
[00:59:00]  Tumble out.  Just kind of roll on out.  And, uh...  But the big...  Then he did some gay bar scene.  But it's a sketch.  You know, they do that.  It's okay.  He's versatile, I guess, as an actor.  The Rock.  Sure.  He played it very well.  Yeah.  But then here's the kicker.  A sketch that wasn't a gay sketch or anything.  Except for the fact that Chris Kattan was in it.  He's playing some mullet-headed guy who's getting into fights with his bleach-blonde trailer-trash chick. 
[00:59:30]  And he fell off of the roof of his house or something.  And the EMT is played by The Rock.  He brings him into the hospital to the doctor.  And he's, like, trying to get off the gurney the whole time.  So The Rock is holding down Chris Kattan.  The whole...  Half the sketch.  But he's holding him down by the thigh and his stomach.  The Rock, the whole time, The Rock is rubbing Chris Kattan's stomach and thigh. 
[01:00:00]  Just, like, kind of holding him down.  And I turn to my girlfriend.  I go, The Rock, what is with him?  He's touching all over.  He's feeling Chris Kattan up.  His chest, his stomach, and his thighs.  And my girlfriend said, well, maybe, you know, he's trying to hold him down.  That's part of the sketch.  I was like, all right, I'll buy that for now.  So halfway through the sketch now, he calms down.  And he's just laying on the gurney now.  Not struggling.  And The Rock is still rubbing his belly and grabbing his thigh. 
[01:00:30]  Very close to his crotch and his ass.  And I'm right there.  I was like, all right.  The Rock is making up for this.  That wasn't part of the sketch.  No, he didn't have to have his hands on Chris Kattan the whole sketch.  But he's a wrestler.  Hey, you want me to go?  Maybe he was just a little nervous.  Look, I don't know what you want to call it.  I call it it looked like the guy enjoyed touching Chris Kattan a little too much and went above  and beyond the sketch to touch Chris Kattan.  I'm sure Chris Kattan didn't mind it. 
[01:01:00]  And The Rock looked like, you know, he was touching.  He was a little obviously touching.  You know what I mean?  No, there wasn't a mango sketch.  And that makes him gay?  I say yes.  I believe.  No, it was showing me that maybe The Rock has some tendencies.  Holy yes.  Maybe The Rock wants to be gay, but it would ruin his image.  Thank God The Rock hates us.  So he's got to take it where he can, which is just touching Chris Kattan on his thighs and lower buttock and his stomach and chest. 
[01:01:30]  Dude, if you saw this, please, anybody that saw it, back me up on this.  He was all over him.  He was rubbing and touching when he didn't have to be.  I watched part of it because I was doing sets.  I did see him on the TV and the screen.  Incidentally, I just took the female or male test on the Internet that someone sent me.  Oh, someone sent me that, too.  I only got through like 12 because I had to run in here.  But so far, I'm 11 out of 12 correct.  I'm professional.  Oh, you can tell? 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, of course.  It's easy.  I missed one.  Yeah, me too so far.  Which one did you miss?  I don't know.  One of the faggots.  I mean, I don't remember which one.  Oh, God.  I want to make that test a little more shocking.  And where people would really want to do it is they show you male or female.  Well, how is the test done?  Why do you want to see their mules?  What is it?  No, if you're wrong, boom.  You get it.  There it is.  You get a picture.  Here's a bunch of pictures of girls.  Oh, it's done by pictures?  Yeah.  Faces.  It's like 15.  Just faces.  Just faces.  And then you have to decide female or male.  What's the upside of taking this test? 
[01:02:30]  Well, you just, is it to be a silly goose?  But here's the thing, though.  Now, this is why it's better than doing it.  A silly goose.  You have to just do the face because when you're talking to a young lady, you need to be  But I'm just saying when they do it.  For a price.  Just for the shock value is what I'm saying is that when you decide female or she-male,  and then they write like, you know, female.  Oh, the answer should be junk or.  No, no, no.  What it should be is after you answer and then it tells you if you're correct or not  is show you the junk.  And then it should have a contact number.  Just for the shock value.  Right. 
[01:03:00]  Some type of email address to get a hold of that person.  I'm sure Steve will put it on foundrymusic.com.  The Rock says.  All right.  Oh, so we got a couple more examples of show us your balls.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I hope he wants to see the junk.  They should show us the junk.  Well, of course.  Maybe we can guess cut or uncut.  No, all I'm saying, I know this sounds bad, but if you're going to do it, if you're going  to do one of these stupid tests where you're going to figure out if it's a female or a  she-male, then you know what?  You should be exposed to the junk. 
[01:03:30]  No, you shouldn't.  Why not?  For what?  Just so you could go, oh, crap, I'm wrong again.  I didn't need to see junk.  I knew instinctively.  Relax, Jimmy.  Let you know.  Relax, little Jimmy.  Oh, look at this guy saying Rock had his hands on Katam for five seconds.  I'm just fantasizing.  No.  No.  He was all over him the whole time.  Just rubbing and kneading and massaging.  Were you hoping you were Chris Kitts' hands?  You know, I was just saying, God, why does he get all the good big man hands on him? 
[01:04:00]  All right.  Well, we have this show's your balls thing.  Yeah.  Game on.  After what happened Friday night.  Game on.  Mm-hmm.  And thinks we should do more Broadway shows.  I like that.  You know, something that's part of the balls thing.  I'm thinking we should expand a little bit.  Expand to live TV and other things.  I like that.  Other venues.  I like that.  And we'll reward you if you show us your balls in a big show us your balls.  In a big bad way, okay? 
[01:04:30]  Do you remember Brian who ruined, what movie did he ruin?  Was it a Kevin Costner movie?  Was it Message in a Bottle?  Yeah.  I think it was Message in a Bottle.  This is great.  So Brian decided he wanted to do something for the show.  He called up.  I think he already did it.  He called us with the tape, right?  Right.  So he went to see Message in a Bottle, I believe.  Mm-hmm.  And decided that he needed to ruin the plot for everybody in the theater before they saw it.  Right.  I believe he stood up in front of a crowded theater and announced what was going to happen 
[01:05:00]  by the end of the movie.  Yeah.  And this is how it went down.  Brian.  Yeah.  It's you?  Yeah, it is.  You got the tape of this or what?  I got it.  Get out of here.  So explain what happened.  What theater you got at?  All right.  We went to the Comac Multiplex.  Yeah.  So we go in.  We get it all.  We scout it out.  We count how many movie theaters it's down so we can have the car waiting in the back.  I don't feel like getting shot or nothing.  So I go up.  I buy one ticket.  I felt like such a loser going in there with one ticket. 
[01:05:30]  I walk all the way to the front, sit down.  I wait until the coming attractions are over and just when it's perfectly quiet and the  music's coming on, I get up.  I scream it out.  Kevin Costner dies at the end of this movie and I just ran out.  I wish I had a bullhorn, but I didn't.  So I went to the middle, waved my hands, got everybody's attention.  So what do they do?  I don't know.  No, like everybody was like looking around like what the hell's going on. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  And I just ran.  Wow.  I don't want to stick around.  I went out the back door.  That's funny.  And then what?  You had the getaway car and you guys took off?  Took off.  We almost got in an accident leaving too.  You got to watch out.  Going so fast.  And you taped it?  We taped it.  All right, let's hear the tape.  All right, hold on.  Showtime.  Light's going out.  Movie's coming on.  Here we go.  Here we go, mother...  Can I have everybody's attention, please? 
[01:06:30]  Kevin Costner dies at the end of this movie.  Thank you.  Go, go, go.  Oh, my God.  Go.  You got it?  You lunatic.  That's awesome.  We got to hang out with you, man.  I've been listening to you guys since the beginning, man.  The Cuban song, all that.  Yeah.  I love it.  Oh, cool. 
[01:07:00]  Hey, Brian, you're the man.  All right, dude.  You'll have to do it again next chick movie that comes out.  I'll do it.  Give me a bullhorn.  Yeah, definitely.  We'll get you a bullhorn.  We'll get you all set up next time.  No problem.  Because you definitely have the balls to do it.  Mike Spratt was driving the getaway car.  All right, thanks, guys.  The getaway car.  Well, thanks a lot for helping our show out.  No problem.  All right, man.  Later.  There's Brian, everyone.  All right.  How cool is that?  I forgot all about that.  May I have your attention, please?  Just in case they wouldn't have noticed him anyway.  Don't you love the way he's going, go, go, go, like the way they were whisking away Reagan 
[01:07:30]  after Hinkley shot him?  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.  Get him to the hospital.  Well, that theater is set up in a way where you can pretty much have someone in a car right  behind the screen.  Yeah.  And you've got the exits right there by the screen.  But you've just got to count and make sure your friend is in the right theater there.  Yes.  Like 10 or 12 in a row or whatever it is.  All right.  That was good.  Now we have the Star Wars thing.  How did this go down?  We had the Star Wars freaks.  They were online for a month or something stupid like that. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  You guys remember?  Yeah.  They were out there like a week early dressed up in their Star Wars.  A week?  No, no.  It was months.  Yeah.  If you remember.  Because this was a big national story.  Just like they're doing within the other Star Wars movies.  Yeah.  They were people waiting outside the theater online for months to be the first to see The  Phantom Menace.  Right.  And they're all dressed up as their favorite Star Wars character.  Oh, it's called The News.  The News would be down there every night. 
[01:08:30]  They all had lightsabers.  And they had lightsaber fights.  The big plastic glowing lightsabers.  And they'd hit themselves.  Yeah.  Two men having a little lightsaber fight.  That's fun if you're using the right equipment.  Hey, your lightsaber's leaking all over mine.  So we decided to send Ben, Rick, and Earl.  This was pretty much the first thing Earl ever wrecked for us.  Oh, no.  In a long line of things, he has messed up for this radio show. 
[01:09:00]  We didn't really know Earl back then.  All we knew was he drove the van, the station van.  We're like, hey, Earl, we need a favor from you.  We need you to, you know, drive the guys down to the front of the theater.  Earl was the wheel man.  They're going to do their thing.  And all you have to do is take off.  Right?  Well, actually, Rick and I had realized that that was a bad move.  And originally, the plan was that I was going to drive it away.  But it got so crazy.  And Earl was behind the wheel.  And we got caught between a bunch of cars. 
[01:09:30]  Did he make a really bad U-turn on the George Washington Bridge?  Nice work, Lou.  I was thinking, the son of a bitch took the van to his girlfriend's house and fell asleep.  The cops got the van.  See, Earl in those tight little shorts like Staggs had on.  That was Samuel Jackson.  Staggs.  Take the coffee.  Well, I'm kidding you.  The stupid son of a bitch went to his girl's house.  Nice work, Lou.  So, the bit was very simple. 
[01:10:00]  Of course, Chips don't get that.  It was very simple.  It was a very simple thing.  And Earl effed up the whole damn thing.  Norton's killing me.  I'm sorry.  Nice work, Lou.  You turn on the bridge.  So, I'm not going to be in the wow van, Sonny.  We just come out blasting, putting stickers all over. 
[01:10:30]  So, Earl's the wheel man.  It was a simple thing.  Go to the theater.  They've been there for months.  They're dressed up as their favorite Star Wars character.  They can't wait for this movie to come out.  Let's wreck the movie for these guys.  These are real hardcore fans.  And give away the key plot line.  So, Earl was supposed to just, you know, stop in front of the theater.  The whole thing should have taken 30 seconds.  Right.  Earl gets boxed in.  He gets boxed in knowing that he's going to have to make a getaway.  Yeah.  And the best part of this, all Earl could say is, oh, it's a Jersey driver. 
[01:11:00]  They're the one that screwed up.  He was trying to blame it on the car that had gotten from us.  He parked in a position where he was going to be boxed in.  Right.  Which you just don't do.  You guys knew the plot line somehow?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I forgot how he found out.  Somebody sent them to us.  Sent them or whatever.  They have all key plot lines that you, if you're a fan, you do not want to know when  you go into the movie.  Did you have a bullhorn?  Oh, yeah.  They had a bullhorn.  I think they pulled up and tried to gain their confidence by giving away a few items  to get them a little closer to the van. 
[01:11:30]  We gave away pens.  Pens or maybe keychains.  Pens and keychains.  No, we gave them what later turned into weapons.  Right.  Well, yeah.  It was brilliant.  Flying projectiles.  Right.  Right.  Which you hear hitting the van.  It's classic.  And they share.  Give away Nerf balls.  And goosh balls like that rosy.  That's madcap humor.  But they were cheering us like, oh, look.  They're giving us free stuff.  The station is coming down to support the guys that are hanging out online.  And then they just start blurting out.  I haven't heard this in a long time.  And I think Rick then said, and by the way, and then boom, here come the plot lines. 
[01:12:00]  But the first track is Rick yelling at Ben.  What was this about?  Oh, that's right.  Rick, very angry.  I gave out the keychains.  Well, first of all, we were so disorganized when we got down there.  No one knew what we were doing.  The original brilliant plan was we were going to try and run.  We were going to run away from the van and try and see if we could get away.  Right.  But it was completely unorganized.  I got out, and Roger was the brilliant one that gave us a bunch of metal keychains to give out.  Listen to Adolph Rick yelling at everybody. 
[01:12:30]  And hard plastic pens that came flying back at us.  And, you know, I'm on hold with you guys here at the station because, you know, we're trying to sync it up to make sure we do it live on the air.  This was the early days of the O&A show in New York City.  Pre-delay.  We were still trying to figure out our team.  Rick, so angry.  Listen to the anger.  Listen to the Latin rage in Rick's voice.  Yeah, this is before they actually did the bit.  Rick just losing his mind.  Get his ass over here. 
[01:13:00]  Jesus Christ.  Jesus Christ.  Whoa, and now we're not going to have anything to give people.  What the f***?  Now we've got to move on.  Oh, this whole f***ing bit is trash.  Jesus Christ.  Where the hell is Ben?  Is he out there still that idiot?  What are you doing giving away stuff yet?  I haven't started.  Oh, I thought you were going to start.  Oh, Jesus.  What the f*** were you doing?  I don't tell me that.  No, I didn't say go out.  I said get ready.  We're going to do this now.  Now we've got no CDs. 
[01:13:30]  How are we going to start?  You have more stuff.  You have more stuff.  Oh.  Well, why did you start for it?  It ruins the bit.  I didn't.  You didn't.  Why did you say start?  Jesus Christ.  I never said start.  I never said start.  Why did you start giving out stuff?  I thought you were f***ing on the phone.  I am on the phone.  They got me on hold.  I didn't know that.  Well, sit in here.  We're going to get a f***ing...  Soon.  All right.  Do you want...  Let's try this again, okay?  Jesus Christ. 
[01:14:00]  That's good, man.  Rick, you sound like...  Jesus Christ.  Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes on.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, the whole bit is ruined.  Rick, you sound like the biggest ass, man.  How long has Henry Hill been your producer?  That's all we had.  What did you do?  No, that's all we had.  I need that money.  They were going to find the pens, Henry. 
[01:14:30]  No!  What the f*** did you do?  What did you do?  The best is you hear Earl, as usual, right on the ball.  Where is he?  I don't know.  You know?  Whatever you guys did to those dirtbags for standing out...  You know what you should do for the next ones the guys did online the night before the film?  Get that cancerous breast that guy has and mush it in the guy's face.  You're first online, you mush it in his dumb beard.  Tell him it's one of Lucas' prop aliens.  Yeah. 
[01:15:00]  He'll love it.  It's a little scuttly thing they're going to make and sell out of it.  It's called a waka waka.  Give the waka waka a kiss.  All right.  So...  Oh, Lucas.  Thanks.  So that's Rick losing his mind.  Yeah.  Then they reorganize.  Yes.  Backed up and regrouped.  But as they try to reorganize, Earl had no clue that he was being boxed in, which means  the bit was going to be in trouble.  Right.  Because the key to this is the quick getaway. 
[01:15:30]  Getaway.  And as we've learned, Earl is not the man you put behind the wheel when you need quick  anything.  You need Nestle quick.  You don't send Earl.  So they reorganized it now.  This is how it went down on the radio.  Rick!  Guys!  What's up, buddy?  What's the crowd like?  Well, we're in front of the Ziegfeld Theater.  Everybody's buying their tickets for Star Wars, which is opening next week.  And let me just take a look down the street here.  There are tons of people.  We've got a few TV crews. 
[01:16:00]  Channel 7.  I almost hit a biker.  Channel 1.  There's people getting interviewed over there.  And I think we're going to surprise them.  And we're going to give away some free CDs and stuff.  Cotese of, of course, Opie and Anthony and N.E.W.  And a few other surprises for Star Wars fans.  Oh, that should be nice.  Let's hear some of this.  This is cute radio.  Hold on.  Here we go.  All right.  Hey, Star Wars fans!  Opie and Anthony from W.N.E.W. 
[01:16:30]  Say thanks for listening.  And, of course, since you guys are online, you've been waiting a long time.  We're going to hook you up with some free CDs.  Whoa!  He just won them over.  Whoa!  Oh, yeah!  Oh, yeah.  I mean, it's great.  And the funny thing is, as soon as I said that, Ben got about five feet from the van and they surrounded him.  Yeah, yeah, free stuff.  People love free stuff.  Yeah, so now they go to the van.  So now the van is surrounded and Earl is blocked in. 
[01:17:00]  Right.  Very important to the rest of this tape.  Whoa!  This is all going on in the air.  I think the guy's heard you back in the studio.  We're going to hook you up with some free CDs.  Whoa!  And you've also got some TV cameras.  We'll make sure you guys get on TV tonight and all that stuff.  So, uh, Grant, what are you still keeping up with me?  And, uh, the front of this Cleaver house is a facade.  It's called a facade as we take the Universal Studio tram around the back. 
[01:17:30]  You'll see there's nothing but two-by-fours holding up the false front, which, of course, is the definition of facade.  Now we'll go, uh, over the bridge.  Uh-oh, it doesn't look very sturdy.  Looks a little rickety.  I'm Mad Max, and remember, you call your people, I'll call mine, and we'll do lunch, or whatever the hell his little catchphrase was.  I love that he was the Universal Studios tour guide.  I love it.  He was using that voice during his time.  I know.  Well, people, now, we'll be another day back in the studio. 
[01:18:00]  We're going to need your 50% of this, people.  Your half of this.  They work off your energy.  No, it's great about this.  So far, so good, Rick.  Rick is like, and, uh, okay, now, Ben, hand out the free stuff, and you can tell Rick had a nose in his head, like, okay, here comes the bad part.  Right.  And he's trying to get himself psyched up.  He's like, okay, Ben, give it out.  Well, we've got some TV cameras.  We'll make sure you guys get on TV tonight and all that stuff.  So, uh, Ben, why don't you start handing out those TVs?  Go, go, go.  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. 
[01:18:30]  Give it out more stuff to celebrate the opening of Star Wars.  I'll pick your cell phone.  That's Earl now beeping the horn, knowing that here it comes, knowing that there's going to be angry Star Wars fans any second now,  and now he's beeping, trying to get the guy out of his way.  Yeah.  But meanwhile, Earl had pulled up behind the car, like right on the bumper. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, yeah, he didn't have to.  Right.  So he's going to have to back out of the spot.  Oh, go F yourselves.  That's the best.  Here we go.  There's Earl.  Earl's panicking.  Oh, God.  Please, for the love of God, get the F out of my life.  Earl's going to end up like Tarantino in Reservoir Dogs.  It's a bullet in his head.  Thanks, Billy, for still hoping Anthony on the portable award for hanging out and waiting for your sister to go online. 
[01:19:30]  We're going to let you know that s*** has a s*** and they s*** for security reasons.  Those beeps were key plot lines.  The only reason they're still bleeped, we don't have a copy of them unbleeped.  Unfortunately, we don't.  Yeah, but we didn't want to, like, ruin it for the listeners.  Well, we knew if we did.  Yeah.  Because they'd kill us.  And they would turn off the radio.  Yeah.  You know, so it's beeped.  But basically what you're hearing is Rick give away the key, the plot lines of the movie, and that's why it's beeped.  Right.  I think that first one was that the princess had a twin. 
[01:20:00]  Right.  The princess had a twin, and it wasn't her.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  You know the story.  That's not even important.  After he gets all the plot lines ruined, just listen to what happens.  Well, thanks for listening to Hopey and Anthony on the portable award for hanging out and waiting for your sister to go online.  We've got to let you know that s*** has a s*** and they s*** for security reasons.  That's what you're listening to.  S***.  S***.  S***.  In the movie. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, jeez.  I've been...  Hurry up.  Get out of here.  Get out.  Go, guys.  All right.  So, okay.  Now they're taking the lovely gifts that have been at hand of them and now using them as primitive projectiles,  throwing them, and you can hear them hitting the van.  Now Rick almost gets hit by something.  He goes, oh, wait a minute.  They're throwing things.  And then they jump in the van and realize that Earl is now boxed in.  Boxed in and can't move.  In the movie.  Oh, jeez.  I've been...  Hurry up. 
[01:21:00]  Get out of here.  Get out.  Go, go, go, go.  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.  Let me try and get one more.  One more before we go in here.  Oh, man.  We're double parked.  Freaking...  Earl finally notices that he's double parked, you idiot.  Oh, we're double parked.  Oh, man, we're double parked.  We're not going anywhere.  He's panicking.  He's beeping the horn like crazy, panicking, and then realizes he's double parked.  Oh, shit. 
[01:21:30]  In the movie.  Oh, jeez.  I just...  Hurry up.  Get out of here.  Get out.  Go, go, go, go, go.  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.  Let me try and get one more.  One more before we go in here.  Oh, man.  We're double parked.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Roll down your window.  Keep going.  Get on.  Get on.  Get on.  Get on.  Ben, hold your window.  Oh, shit.  Oh.  Move the window. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Ben.  Earl, get out of here.  Get out.  Go, go, go, go, go.  Lock the door.  Go.  Jesus Christ, we're trapped.  Jesus Christ, we're trapped.  Oh, that classic.  This sounds like a scene out of Black Hawk Down.  What is...  You know, they can't get out of there, and they're taking fire. 
[01:22:30]  What an idiot.  These are Star Wars fans.  It's not like they're going to see the new Spike Lee film.  What an idiot.  Go.  Jesus Christ, we're trapped.  Oh, no.  Uh-oh.  People are throwing shit.  Uh-oh.  You need an escape route, you dope.  Uh-oh.  Guys?  Yeah.  Yeah, we're trying to get out of here right now.  Oh, come on.  They're throwing stuff at the van. 
[01:23:00]  Some people are punching the van here.  You can hear them punching the van.  Get out of there.  You can throw the pins back at...  Ben, you gave them pins?  Ben gave them pens.  They're throwing the f***ing pens at me.  Oh, Jesus.  Hurry up.  Hurry up.  Hurry up.  Go, go, go, go.  Just go.  Go.  Just go.  You got it.  Go. 
[01:23:30]  Go.  Oh, Jesus.  Roll down that window one more time.  I'll get one more.  Oh, my God.  Hurry up.  Hurry up.  Oh, my God.  Jesus Christ.  Drive.  Uh-oh.  Hello, Rick.  Hello.  Rick.  Uh-oh.  Oh, man.  Oh, no.  What happened?  Rick.  Holy Jesus.  Give us a call back if you're listening.  And that's how it ended.  Yeah, we lost communication with them, but they all made it back finally. 
[01:24:00]  That's classic.  You get beaten the hell out of the van.  Can you get the storylines for the new one?  Is that possible?  Yeah, we could easily do that.  To blow it for these idiots that have been standing in line for weeks and months.  Dopes.  And, of course, Opie, I'm getting on instant feedback the obligatory thanks for ruining  the phantom menace for me.  Yeah, of course.  Shut up.  So, there you go.  There's three examples of show us your balls.  Show us your balls.  That's what we're looking for.  We're accepting more tapes.  You figure out how you want to show us your balls, and we'll do the rest of the radio for 
[01:24:30]  you, okay?  And, of course, for that, we can say, we'll give you a cool prize.  Oh, without a doubt.  Show us your balls, man.  And if you missed the Kathleen Turner audio, we'll play it again a little later for you.  Okay?  Right-o.  Anthony, we have a musical guest outside.  Oh, yes.  We couldn't announce it because the douchebag across the street likes to rain on our parade  every chance he could get.  Uh-huh.  Coming into the studio in just a few minutes, Andrew W.K.  He was on SNL this weekend, and we'll talk to him, so stay there.  Hi, I'm Dave. 
[01:25:00]  I'm Perry.  Steven.  And we're Jane's Addiction.  It's Jane's Addiction.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Anthony and Opie.  And you are listening to Andy W.K.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else outside of New York, you could use 866-277-4.  Wow, that's Andrew W.K.  Party hard.  Yes.  And in the studio, Andrew W.K.  Hello.  I want to move over a little bit because I can't see. 
[01:25:30]  I want to be able to see everybody.  You're not going to be able to see everyone.  No, I can see everyone.  Behind the wall.  We strategically put the guest behind the screen so we can, like, mess with our guest without  them knowing it.  That's Opie.  You're the first person to figure that out, by the way.  O.P.  Jimmy, Anthony.  Yeah.  And Jimmy.  And Jim Norton.  Jimmy.  Who's the sick one?  Checking all the TV schedules.  Yeah, now that he has a TV, he's all happy.  Look at Jim.  He gets an effing TV today.  He finally enters the world of the living and gets a television.  So what is he looking at? 
[01:26:00]  The TV listings.  What can I watch?  He's been reading the listings for years without really knowing what it applied to him.  Yeah, what it is.  Now he puts it all together.  It's like, this is so cool.  I could watch them now.  Welcome.  Welcome to this century, Jim Norton.  Finally, all my She-Mail videos.  Wow, I thought she was a girl.  Uncut and fully functional.  Is it a combo TV VCR?  Or you had a VCR for years, you just listened to the audio off the VCR?  This is a great show.  My VCR is broken and my DVD player. 
[01:26:30]  I had to buy two new things today.  Who gets broken?  Like, he had a broken one.  When one of these things break, you just throw it away.  You throw it away now.  And that isn't even coming from anybody.  Anyone could do this.  You know, I used to...  You throw it away.  I used to...  I had a camcorder, a real old one, the real big ones, you know, full-size VHS.  Yeah, full-size tape goes in.  And it was black and white monitor.  I lost the magnifying eyepiece on the monitor.  And so it was just a tiny screen.  And I used to watch whole movies, plugging my headphones into another, like, four-track  recorder so I could hear it in stereo.  And watch whole movies, holding it, laying on my back, holding the thing up and looking 
[01:27:00]  through a half-inch black and white screen.  With one eye.  With one eye.  I watched adult movies on that, too.  Nice.  That's when you go to the bathroom and it's all dark.  And one eye is like night vision.  And the other eye is completely black.  And it throws your equilibrium.  There's a big discharge coming from the eye.  It's all milky and watery.  Depends on the film you're watching.  Yeah, it depends what that discharge was.  Could be from your guest, right, Jimmy?  Well, Andrew WK was on SNL. 
[01:27:30]  We got to ask him about that.  Wow.  Yeah, I saw that on Saturday, of course.  You rocked.  I saw parts of it on Sunday.  Dude, you were on fire.  You know, I didn't make the connection because I was watching with the sound down and I'm  ready to go on stage.  And I'm like, who is this dude?  Because you were on fire.  He's like, you are like a retard on stage.  You are jumping around.  The guy, I don't know how you go through a whole show.  That's just one tune.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, we definitely were, you know, thinking of it as this is our one chance.  Blow it all out, right?  If we're going to do it, we got to do it.  But that's how we always think of it is, you know, we got one day to do it, one life, 
[01:28:00]  one chance.  Might as well be the last show.  Might as well be the last concert tonight.  We're playing tonight.  Irving Plaza.  Yeah.  We're going to give all we can.  And I really thought about that, especially Saturday Night Live.  I was really thinking, you know, I'm doing this on behalf of everybody I've ever known  who's ever helped me, the people I haven't even met that believe in this.  It really felt like the culmination of a lot of people's work, not just mine.  That's like one thing that, that's kind of a defining moment.  You know, you grow up watching SNL, you grow up watching bands on SNL, and all of a sudden 
[01:28:30]  you're on that stage and they're saying, all right, you're live, let's go.  Boggling.  Very, very boggling.  It must be.  It's one of those moments.  I was going through your mind just before they introduced you.  What was the thought?  No thoughts, actually.  Holy S.  It almost, you just blank out.  You almost just blank out.  Just do it.  And you get on there and they're giving the countdown and they're 10 seconds, 5 seconds  and Andrew, and you know, The Rock's on there saying Andrew WK like 5 feet away.  The Rock says.  And what a cool guy he was.  He was, he was really, really. 
[01:29:00]  A gay man, The Rock?  No, his wife was there.  Well, who knows, you know.  Because he was touching Chris Kattan in that one bit a little more.  Now, come on, did you see that?  Were you watching that?  I did see that part.  They changed so much as a thing.  You know, they do this, this rehearsal right before, actually, on Saturday.  Yeah, they do a whole version of the show.  The whole thing.  And they changed so much.  You know, on the first version, Chris Kattan only hit them once and they said all this  different stuff and it was interesting to see what they changed.  But I was just impressed by how well run the whole thing was and how on top.  Yeah, they got it down.  They were, they're doing so many years.  They're hard workers.  But The Rock was just touching Chris Kattan. 
[01:29:30]  He's touching his stomach and his thighs and trying to hold him on that gurney.  Patting that pink, pink belly.  I just want to reach in and touch me some myself.  Huddle, Huddle, Jim.  But he's a fantastic, he's fantastic.  He was really, really cool.  Yeah, boy, they jacked you on your ending.  Say again.  They jacked you on the ending of SNL.  What happened to the, like, like, you know, at the end of Saturday Night Live, everyone  gets out and hugs and hugs and it's a big, long thing.  The band's playing.  Everyone gets to wave.  You're staying around for some time.  I've been watching it going, all right, enough already. 
[01:30:00]  They've been doing this five minutes.  The end comes on.  The Rock grabs you.  Right.  And goes, hey, it's Andrew W.K.  And gone.  Oh, really?  They went to commercial.  Oh, you should have seen what happened.  Are you serious that none of that got on?  Serious?  None.  I jumped and water went all over the place because I have water stuffed in my pants.  Yeah, I saw that.  You came walking.  I had a bunch of bottles of water.  Went over everybody.  Then I jumped on top of the rock and climbed over onto the people with crowd surfing on  that small crowd.  And I think everybody must have known they already cut because everybody left.  I was like, where'd everybody go? 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, they, they, I mean, every SNL ending since 1975 or whatever it is on has been that  long ending.  You know what it is?  It's because we got to play two songs and I'm, I'm, I'm glad at least we got to play  two songs rather than the ending.  Yeah, but at least it was on video somewhere.  Yeah.  But it was just, again, it was amazing.  And I really, really thought of it like, you know, when we're doing stuff, it's like,  it's like we're doing it again on behalf of everybody.  You know what I mean?  It's not, we work so hard.  This is our time.  Now we get to kick back into it.  It's like, no, what can we do to, for all those people who, who, who don't get this kind 
[01:31:00]  of a chance?  You know what I mean?  To not waste.  That's true.  Now you probably grew up playing around a lot of people, a lot of other bands, you know,  getting to know some of the people playing in some of the same clubs.  For sure.  And then you're like the guy that all of a sudden is on SNL.  He started playing classical piano.  Classical.  Me, me, me, me, me, boom.  Yeah.  How did that happen?  Can you play changes on piano?  Can you play that song?  By Bowie?  Sabbath.  Oh, Sabbath.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  Well, you know, yeah.  Victim of Changes by Priest and Changes by Black Sabbath.  I don't know as well.  So did your parents want you to become a pianist or whatever?  Yeah.  Pianist.  Right, right, right.  You got to be careful about it.  And what went wrong where you decided to go, screw this piano crap, I'm going to start  rocking?  Actually, I never said that.  In fact, all these songs are written on piano.  Wow.  It all comes from piano.  Yeah.  You know how a lot of people get into a band and that will be the way they get into music  or a certain record or if they see a video? 
[01:32:00]  And that's all fantastic.  And it just happened with me that I got into music from music, you know what I mean?  Which is cool.  Yeah.  There's no right or wrong way for sure, but it allowed for certainly a real broad idea  of what music is, which is, you know, first and foremost, melody and rhythm.  Yeah.  But some people hop on the piano and they end up being like the AV geek in school and playing  piano for the school plays.  I did that.  I did stuff like that.  I did whatever I could, but at the end of the day, it was a love of melody and to this 
[01:32:30]  point, just taking melody and rhythm and what feels good inside and making it as loud and  big and thrilling as possible and not being afraid to use anything that will achieve that.  Any instrument, anything we can do, expending as much energy at all times, looking at like  last, you know, every day is the last day.  I'm just glad there's a party song on the radio again.  Thanks to Andrew WK.  There we go.  They're changing the sound back to, you know, where I think we need to go.  More party songs and hot chicks.  Not so much a return, a return or even a reaction to, not a return to the past, not a reaction 
[01:33:00]  to now, but.  It's just a lot different than what's been on the radio the last three or four years.  What are we going to do, you know, now, now, like into the future?  There's just lines, lines all over the place being drawn and they're just waiting to be  crossed.  Right.  And it's not that doing it, we're doing it for the sake of doing it, doing it because  it feels right.  You know what?  That's the hardest thing.  Just when you find something that feels good inside your stomach, you don't need to question  it.  You don't need to even figure it out.  You just say, you know what?  This feels good.  I like this.  Hold on to that.  Don't let that go.  Don't examine it so much.  Yeah.  And don't ever let it go because that's sacred. 
[01:33:30]  That's what makes life worth living.  It's just nice.  Jason has a question for you.  Jason, what's up?  Hey, Andrew.  Yes, sir.  Your CD rocks.  First of all.  Thank you very much, Jason.  That is a kick-ass song.  Thank you.  But I got a question for you.  Your blood goatee, it was her time of month.  Red wings.  Running some red lights.  Yeah, a lot of people trying to figure out where the cover comes from.  And I'm sure you're getting hell for this cover by all that.  Yeah.  By all the parole groups.  Quote, provocative indeed. 
[01:34:00]  They cover it up.  You know, I always say they cover it up, but they can't stop what they can't end.  So they can put stickers over it.  They can bury it in the bottom of the earth, but we'll dig it out.  Does Walmart do that?  They cover it up.  And they still sell guns in half the store, but they cover up.  Are you having problems with the cover?  Yeah.  You know what?  Not problems.  Not problems.  But they're definitely trying to cover.  They are covering up.  You know what they're doing so far?  It comes with a...  I'll answer your question in a second, Jason.  But they do put a black sticker over on the shrink wrap.  And some stores have even gone so far as to take the CD with the sticker on it, covering 
[01:34:30]  the blood, take it, open that shrink wrap, take the insert out, turn it around backwards,  and put it in with the back of the cover.  Really?  Yeah.  Because they're just so...  You should have put a goat taking it in the A on the back cover.  Wow.  Then they really wouldn't know what to do, wouldn't they?  Or Andrea Yates and five little bodies piled up.  Turn around and show that to your kids.  We should explain the cover real fast.  It's Andrew WK with, like the guy said, a blood goatee.  Yeah.  And a lot of...  A bad bloody nose.  Yeah.  A severe bloody nose.  The way it all happened is I said, I want to have a picture of me with a bloody nose. 
[01:35:00]  And I didn't intend to use it for the record cover initially.  Pardon me.  I just wanted to use it, have a picture like that, period.  No puns.  Woo!  So I actually bashed my nose with a brick, with a piece of a cinder block.  It bled.  The blood you see come out of my nose.  That's real blood?  The blood out of my nose is real.  And the rest out of the mouth is actually pig's blood.  And I was hearing earlier that you guys have an affinity of your own for pig's blood.  Oh, blood, pigs, lamb, everything.  Real sweet, soft lamb meat minced up with the liver. 
[01:35:30]  We shot a girl with pig's blood.  You have not seen fun.  So you grab a super soaker, fill it with lamb blood.  Yeah.  Not the little super soakers, the big, huge one.  Right, I saw one back there.  In her brown panties, line her up and just hit her with lamb blood.  It looks fantastic.  The sweetest, most gentle lamb blood.  Yes.  Yeah.  So that's what we used for the come out of the mouth just because there wasn't enough for my nose.  But it made for a good picture.  And we ended up, you know, I said this would be good for the cover.  Done.  You know, and it wasn't, it wasn't, this has a message that I'm attaching that stands for this. 
[01:36:00]  I don't need, you know, it's everything.  That looks cool.  It's freedom.  It just looks cool.  Yeah.  What do you need to know?  The more it is, the more it is.  The less I say it's not, you know, the more it is.  So it's, it's, it's, it's, it's everything.  It's freedom.  What's it like on the road these days?  It's got to be insane, right?  It's busy, that's for sure.  Yeah.  And I wouldn't have it any other way.  People say, what do you do in your free time?  I say, this is my free time.  Yeah.  You know, my whole life before this was working jobs and then playing songs and doing whatever I could when I wasn't at the job.  Now all I have is, is, is free time. 
[01:36:30]  What'd you, what'd you do?  Yeah, I was going to say, what was the last job you had before you made it?  The last real good job I was working at, you guys would know, I was working at Bergdorf Goodman, moving furniture.  Furniture, Bergdorf Goodman.  Oh man, and that was, I'd walk in wearing an obituary shirt and it'd be like the end of the world up in place.  What else did you say?  Before that, the coolest job I ever had in New York was selling bubblegum machines.  And I sold bubblegum ball machines.  Actually, we put Lifesavers in the machines in little mini rolls.  But sold those down in Wall Street area on 29 Broadway. 
[01:37:00]  For real?  For about a year and did okay.  You must have gotten laid a lot, you know.  Oh, wow.  It was all over the phone.  So there's a lot of phone lay, a lay phoneman basic premise.  But the idea was, is John there, please?  John, I'd like to talk to you about vending.  John, do you understand that America has a love affair with candy?  And what we've done is we've capitalized on this love affair and put it into a countertop vendor.  And with the proper placement, John, the riches are unbelievable.  God, that's awful.  So yeah, it was intense, that's for sure. 
[01:37:30]  And there was a lot of living out of a coin jar.  You know, the coin jar, the big mason jar that's there when you have pocket change.  Tapping into quarter stacks, you know, for those weeks when things weren't doing so good.  Jeez, you had the jar?  Yeah, I had a jar.  I just went through the pockets in my coat and hoped that I missed it last week.  I had a jar that was...  Or dig through your car.  Yeah, I've done that.  The car.  All silver, too.  I really tried to cut out pennies.  It was supposed to be all silver.  And at one point, I had it separated just silver.  Silver became dimes and nickels. 
[01:38:00]  Quarters were their own jar.  That's like pennies.  Penny money.  Yeah.  And the pennies were another thing.  I had like $300 in there when I traded in it at the food and pour room.  Wow.  $300.  I would hope I'd scrape up like $5 for a sandwich, you know?  It was more in the quarter, so that was good.  Hey, Ian wants to say hi from Philly.  Ian.  Hey, Ian.  Hey, Andrew.  How you doing?  Hey, not too bad.  Actually, me and my friends just got a...  We were actually at the show the other night.  We got dressed up like you.  That you were...  Okay.  Ian, of course I remember you. 
[01:38:30]  How are you?  These guys.  I'm glad you're doing a great job.  How does someone dress up like Andrew WK?  Well, actually, me and four other people, we got, you know, the really white jeans.  We got the white sneakers, the white T-shirt.  Covered ourselves in mud.  And actually, we went out and we bought fake blood, which was a real pain in the A, because  it was going to sell blood in, you know, the middle of April.  So we went out, we got blood, smeared it all over our faces, like from the nose down.  And people on South Street in Philly were just looking at us like we were the most insane 
[01:39:00]  people in the world.  It was a whole troop of them.  It was five guys and they were going berserk bananas.  That was such an awesome show.  I can't even believe it.  You had fun right here.  Actually, I have to say that it was by far, I go to lots and lots of concerts, by far the  most fun I ever had at any show.  Wow.  Thank you, Ian.  It really was incredible.  What's the chick scene all about these days?  Chick scene is about holding the skull and really looking into the eyes and saying, I 
[01:39:30]  know what you're thinking.  I know what you thought.  And I know everything you're going to think.  And then working from there.  Simply intensity.  Giving them a mouthful of lessons.  Nutrients.  Yeah, nutrients.  Lessons.  Speaking of which, Kerry wants to do something for the show.  Kerry.  Hello.  What's up, Kerry?  Where are you calling from?  Philadelphia.  Philadelphia.  And you want to try today's fake O?  Yeah, but now I'm walking my dog because you have me on hold.  What kind of dog?  What kind of dog is it? 
[01:40:00]  It's a Shih Tzu.  Oh.  Do you have the O while rubbing a little pink lipstick on your mouth?  Hold on.  Let me get in my car.  I live in a condo complex.  Get some peanut butter and smear it.  Have a surprise party.  And before you know it, there's a contest that we got.  You got a contest going?  No, it's just something that, it like pleases us.  I'll tell you, the wow has been, the wow thing is just, I see that all over.  I see that in the world.  I almost did that the other day.  Yeah, it's ridiculous. 
[01:40:30]  Hold on.  What, Kerry?  I almost did that the other day next to a wow sticker.  Almost.  Almost.  What made you stop?  What does that mean?  I was about a mile from work and I know a lot of things.  I had my dog with me.  All right.  Well, Kerry, you want to try the fake O?  We have a rock star in the studio today, too.  No, no.  You're the rock star.  Okay, I'll do it.  All right?  All right.  Okay, wait a minute.  Let me get in my car.  Now, remember how we like this.  This is going to probably be awful.  The slow build to a crescendo.  This is going to be awful.  This is going to be awful.  What? 
[01:41:00]  No, I didn't say that.  That was Ben.  No.  Ben, shut up.  That's going to be fantastic.  No, reinforcement and positive visualization of this is going to make it good.  Okay.  We're ready.  Oh, okay.  There you go.  It's reserved.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah. 
[01:41:30]  This is awful.  There are sexier sounds coming out of Arafat's Ramallah complex.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  It's in front of my house in my car.  What is my neighbor doing here?  Carrie, that was horrible.  No, there's a certain restraint, though, that I really admired.  There was a certain sucking in of oxygen and then holding on to that oxygen for all it was worth.  Come on, Andrew.  What do you think? 
[01:42:00]  You're going to have that skull in your hand someday looking into her eyes?  A real round, real round, soft skull.  Yeah.  Nothing below her.  Just a skull.  No hand.  Just a hooky head.  Laughing up, lady.  I laugh when you come in.  Thanks, guys.  That was great, Carrie.  Thank you.  Yeah, good job.  Good work.  All right.  Awful.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  Mike wants to say hi to Andrew W.K.  Mike, what's up, bro?  Hey, guys.  I just wanted to say what up to Andrew.  And just as a musician here in New York, I'm just glad to see somebody getting signed and getting out there. 
[01:42:30]  And hopefully, you know, bring back the East Coast thing.  Yes, sir.  It's definitely a group effort, so don't stop doing what you're doing.  That's the thing about this is it's friends.  You know what I mean?  It's friends.  It's not fans and me and this and that and the stage and the audience.  It's friends.  When we come to town, it's your friends playing.  You know what I mean?  And I really, really, really do think about this as the beginning of a whole other level of unconditional invitation.  You know, where you don't have to meet any kind of requirements to be part of this.  You just have to do what you like to do. 
[01:43:00]  You know what I mean?  And that's all we'd want anyone to do anyway.  So you're like going around feeling like, holy gee, how did this happen?  You know, kind of like.  It's like, yeah, you know, we work hard, but there's things going on.  Someone wants this to happen more than me even.  You know what I mean?  Because it can't just be coincidence.  Are you talking about a greater power?  Some kind of larger, larger than the hill of beans with an anthill and a roving kind of caramel slow burn molasses theory. 
[01:43:30]  Something a little bigger.  Than an anthill.  Tommy Mottola?  Something sweet, but I do appreciate it.  And that's the thing is, if you like it, you know that we like it just as much.  Hey, Greg, what's going on, bro?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hey, Andrew, what's up, man?  How you doing?  I'm not doing bad at all.  I had an idea while you guys were talking about the WOW stickers earlier.  What if they gave you a stack of WOW stickers and you put one on your tour boss and all the trucks that go on tour?  And then maybe even, like, each venue you go to, find, like, an inspicuous place somewhere in the venue where you can slap one. 
[01:44:00]  I'll tell you what, 90% of the places we play already have are covered in WOW stickers, and I'm not joking.  I just thought it would be a cool idea.  It is a fantastic idea.  I'm going to go listen to myself.  Later, guys.  All right, Greg.  Thank you.  He's going to go listen to himself.  What was his idea?  I have no idea.  His idea was to keep putting up WOW stickers, and I think that's a good idea.  Yeah, people do that, yeah.  Well, I say we jam party hard, Anthony.  Let us do that.  What's going to be the next single?  Oh, I don't know yet.  Maybe she is beautiful. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  She is beautiful, which is about trying not to be scared when you see a real pretty girl, because sometimes I get scared.  Yeah.  I just love this album, because, I mean, how many chicks are just heaving their badges at you?  At any moment, just stop.  Just stop.  Like, ow, I just got hit with a vag.  Stop throwing your vag, dude.  He's holding my skull and jamming it in my eye and mouth.  You lead with your head, so if I have a hold of the head, the rest of the body will fall.  Is that what it is? 
[01:45:00]  I knew there was a strategy to do.  I've got to say, the CD is so refreshing.  I've got to read the titles of these songs, because we haven't seen an album like this in a long time.  But it's time to party, followed by Party Hard, Girls Own Love, Ready to Die, Take It Off.  I love New York City.  She's beautiful.  Party till you puke.  Fun night.  What do you want to know?  Got to do it.  I get wet.  And don't stop living in the rest.  Six o'clock, baby.  That's it, man.  It is a party record.  It's Andrew W.K. from I Get Wet.  Party hard on the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:45:30]  When it's time to party, we will party hard.  Andrew W.K. from the CD, I Get Wet.  Party hard on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Right.  Only got another minute or two with Andrew W.K.  He's got a sold-out show tonight at Irving Plaza, Anthony.  That looks like it hurts.  That's pretty good.  I don't know.  Actually, you know what?  That gets us warmed up.  That gets warmed up.  It opens the throat.  It gets things moving.  It moves.  There's a lot of congealed, dead cell, membrane, saliva-based fluids that need to come out. 
[01:46:00]  Pack that up, and that kind of does it.  Old chugs.  Hack, hack, hack.  Yeah, kind of like that.  Jose's a drummer.  He has something for you.  Jose, what's up?  Hey, fellas.  First of all, a pleasure for me to be able to get on the phone with you guys.  Pleasure for me.  Andrew.  Yes, sir.  I just saw your video for the first time a couple nights ago.  It's pretty kick-ass.  I haven't picked up your album yet, so apologies for that.  No, no.  And I just heard about this possible controversy with your album cover, so I just want to maybe 
[01:46:30]  suggest for your next album to have a lady on all fours, and you have a leather glove  to her face.  Maybe call it Smell the Glove.  And she's sniffing my glove.  It's not sexist, it's sexy.  Not racist, racial.  What's wrong with being sexy?  No, but in all seriousness, I'm 26 years old.  I'm a drummer.  I've been playing for many, many years.  And what did you tell yourself in those moments where you're not sure if it's going to work 
[01:47:00]  out?  Because I'm going crazy.  I don't know how much longer I should really try to do what I'm trying to do.  Oh, this is the best thing.  This is the best thing.  This is the best thing.  All you have to do is take it day by day on one hand.  And the thing is, I never counted on achieving any one thing.  All I ever wanted to achieve was being able to continue.  So you can't count 100% on, I'm going to achieve this dream to play for a million people.  I'm going to achieve this dream to travel the world. 
[01:47:30]  But you can always count on continuing.  You can always count on trying.  And if you're happy and satisfied enough by that, then you're set.  You're good.  If this all ended for me tomorrow and I went back to playing piano in a room for five  people, I'd be good to go.  You know what I mean?  Because in the end of the day, if that alone, if you can find what makes you satisfied and  do that for the rest of your life, you're set.  But a lot of guys that are in bands, they want to play in front of an arena.  They want to get a record deal.  They want to sell albums.  You know what I mean?  It's true.  It's true.  And in those goals, you know what?  You can't. 
[01:48:00]  We can't decide what's given to us or what comes our way necessarily.  But you can decide what you do with it.  So I would say on the face of frustration and obstacle just through endurance and hard  work and patience, that's true strength.  You know what I mean?  So where do you focus then?  Do you focus on getting a product out?  Do you focus on just playing shows?  I focus on waking up every morning and say, what can I do today to make the most of being  alive?  And I'll do every single thing I can within reason.  And you know what?  I mess up a lot and I don't do everything I can.  And then I'll get frustrated and I'll use that frustration tomorrow to make that day 
[01:48:30]  try to do more.  You know what I mean?  I hear you, man.  It's just about not giving in and not giving up for the sake of doing it.  Just for the sake of it.  All right, Jose.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks, Jose.  Don't stop.  All right, there you go.  It's about getting into one more fight with your bandmates at rehearsal.  It's about yelling at your guitar.  Screaming.  Tears.  Crying.  Crying.  It's about being in the studio and arguing about what should be added and what shouldn't  be.  It's about breaking up on the way to recording the first record.  Which has happened with a few of my friends' bands. 
[01:49:00]  And was in a band.  I was hoping something would happen before I got into doing this.  And I was in many bands.  We recorded, did all that.  And the fight, the loading out at the end of the gigs and the snow.  And one of the crap bands that were on before you steals your hand truck.  Oh, man.  Yeah, the equipment theft.  I knew a band whose whole principle was that they formed their whole band based only on  stolen equipment.  That's beautiful.  And stolen merchandise.  That is beautiful.  We were playing somewhere on Bond Street once. 
[01:49:30]  And, you know, they book like ten bands for one night.  Yeah.  You're getting up there.  You're getting the hell off and hoping someone sees you.  Whatever.  Ten minutes including set up.  Yeah.  And the band that's on before us, I don't know, first of all, they're dressed like Klingons.  And the drummer decides he's having his drum kit.  And it's set up like one of those monkey bar sets.  Oh, yeah.  The rack.  The rack.  Yeah, the rack.  And we're sitting there going, this son of a bitch is taking so long to set up and tear down. 
[01:50:00]  Tinker Toys.  Yeah, Tinker Toys.  And we didn't end up going on until, you know, you get on at 2.33 and you're like, everyone's gone anyway.  It's just, I guess those are the things that you have to go through and keep at it.  And not get annoyed with.  You can think of it almost as a challenge, just how exciting, just to look, stare down the face of all those obstacles and say,  and you think you're going to stop me?  No way.  I think it's fun.  I think the more frustrating it got, the harder I worked. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, it was, because out of all the nasty, you know, we'd call them just bone gigs.  It was like, oh, is that a bone gig?  Eight hour bus ride to play for eight people for eight bucks.  Yeah.  That's the standard.  We used to call some of these gigs, all we'd do is drive up and go, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Because it was like, whoever went in to look at the club, they know they come out and we just beep the horn, get them out, and we just drive away.  Like, let's not even frigging deal with this.  But then there'd be a couple of really good ones where you play.  Well, that's the thing, I always looked at even the worst show as, at least I did it, and it couldn't hurt. 
[01:51:00]  You know what I mean?  There's no way it could hurt.  Especially, I didn't have a band for years.  I was playing shows by myself with a keyboard in coffee shops or wherever, and I never turned a show down.  And the way I thought of it is I said, you know what, this is our time.  You know what, this is, those who are alive right now, it doesn't matter what's happened before.  This is our time.  What are we going to do with it?  Are we going to be lazy?  Are we going to complain?  I didn't think it was acceptable for me to complain simply because I had food, a good family, like, you know, a shelter, a job, things like that.  So I said, I will do whatever it takes just to do.  You know what I mean? 
[01:51:30]  So it's not going to be easy, but it's not going to be hard.  That's how it came out.  Would you manage me?  This guy's got an amazing attitude.  What a loser I am.  It's Tony Robbins over here.  He'll be happy.  It works.  Tony Robbins with a guitar.  He's a rock star.  He's banging chicks all over him.  Keeps his chin up, and I can't do a push-up.  Keep their skulls in line.  Anthony, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  How are you guys doing?  Good, man.  Andrew, I'm trying to let you know that your CD pretty much drives me to drink. 
[01:52:00]  It starts with the first song, It's Time to Party.  I feel like raising a cup of beer and just banging my fish.  Start making their way to the liquor cabinet.  But drink in a good way, you know?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, it's like banging my fish.  Not even drinking the beer.  Pretty much having it dumped everywhere.  Is it a bad way to drink?  Yeah, you're depressed, and you're just drowning your sorrows.  Hey, what time did you drink to have fun in your party, man?  The first song is about having a party all by yourself.  In fact, actually, it's about, if you really want to get specific, it's about a young girl 
[01:52:30]  who's having a party all by herself in her bedroom with pleasure.  I'm out of here, guys.  Later.  Okay, take care, Anthony.  But the thing is, that's the thing.  There's no rules here.  There's no rules.  Party is freedom.  There's no rules.  You don't have to drink to be at a party.  You can do whatever you want, and that's the idea.  You don't have to smoke.  You can smoke.  You don't have to do drugs.  You can do drugs.  I always said it's unconditional.  And I want everybody to know that they would never be left out or turned away because they're  not cool enough or they didn't meet the doorman's requirements.  There are no doormen at this party.  But expect to get your skull grabbed. 
[01:53:00]  Massaged.  Gently massaged.  Work the blood into all the areas, all the hair follicles.  Let's get them out of here, man.  Cool, man.  Wow.  Thank you very much, guys.  It's NGWK, the new CD.  I get wet.  I mean, party hard.  You can't turn on MTV without seeing the damn thing.  It's everywhere.  Good luck to you, my friend.  I'm so happy to see you.  And it's just the beginning.  Success.  And have fun tonight at Irving Plaza.  Thank you very, very much.  Sold out show.  Cool.  There you go.  Take care.  You guys are mean.  We're shopping on delivery, my friend.  I don't have kids.  I want porno on my TV. 
[01:53:30]  I want violent video games.  I want violence on TV.  I don't want to take it off because you had kids.  All you people and children make me effing sick.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We're psychotic.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  You guys checking out The Opie and Anthony Show?  All right.  Lots still to do.  We got to talk about Maury Povich in a little while.  He was hiding Pejoria kids all over his office today. 
[01:54:00]  You know something?  It was the sickest Maury I've ever seen.  It was the sickest one I've ever seen.  And we'll get into it in a little bit.  Also, we played the audio earlier.  We're going to try to play it again.  Mission accomplished.  Someone stood up at The Graduate on Broadway with Kathleen Turner and Jason Biggs.  I told Kathleen to put our goddamn clothes back on. 
[01:54:30]  Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes on.  Put your goddamn clothes on.  And, yes, we are taking responsibility for this.  They thought we were going to try to do it this week, so we tricked them.  And we did it Friday night, Anthony.  We had three people that are associated with the show inside the theater, taping from all angles.  And if you missed the audio earlier, stick around.  We're going to play that, hopefully, very, very soon.  But right now, big story in the news.  Oh, my God.  I sure hope this isn't completely true. 
[01:55:00]  And I hope Tom decides to stay on board a little longer.  Well, Tom Brokaw, thinking about retiring, Anthony.  His contract is up, what, in the summer?  And he's not sure if he's going to continue.  I'm not going to re-sign until I'm syndicated in 22 markets.  My contract is up.  I want to be on YSP in Philly.  And Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News. 
[01:55:30]  Anthony, move someone aside and put me, Tom Brokaw, in at YSP in Philly.  Phil, Phil, Phil.  Phil, yeah.  Shouldn't I be able to do that?  I'd be willing to change my slot here at NBC Nightly News  if I could maybe get nights over at YSP in Philly.  Come on, it's a joke.  Shut up.  I understand.  So, he might leave.  Ah, you know what?  This is hogwash.  You think it's hogwash?  It's hogwash.  How old is that saying? 
[01:56:00]  Hogwash comes from, like, the 40s.  Ah, is it?  It's right up there with poppycock.  And take your hands off the white lady, boy.  Hogwash.  Don't cut him down until they get the message.  He's going to continue.  But more importantly, there's some other things in this article, huh?  Well, Tom, not one to sit on his laurels.  He's doing things.  He's got some vault. 
[01:56:30]  And this is directly related.  He's making a difference.  You know what this is?  He's trying to compete with Dan Rather again.  He's competing with Dan Rather.  If you remember, a little while back, Dan Rather had a run-in in Afghanistan where, I believe, a bomb went off.  And he was in a car caravan.  And he was very close to the action.  He got on the news that night and did great in the ratings because he was almost killed.  Right.  Well, Tom Brokaw, not to be outdone, it seems he's doing a special aboard the Stennis, the USS Stennis, the aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. 
[01:57:00]  And Tom Brokaw took a flight in an F-14 over Afghanistan on a mission.  These news guys.  Meanwhile, Peter Jennings, that pussy, just sits there and does nothing.  He's not.  Where is he?  He's not going to ruin his pretty face, Anthony.  I have to put my ass on the line every day in order to get ratings for NBC Nightly News. 
[01:57:30]  I have to cover up.  I have to make good because of this speech impediment.  So now I'm going on bombing mission.  Yeah, there's a tough word.  Anchorman on a bombing mission.  There's a tough word in this article here.  Where is that word?  Where was it from earlier?  Oh, it's where it was talking about staying on with NBC Nightly News.  Of course, it's not in that article.  Why would you have the article that it's actually in? 
[01:58:00]  I forget it.  It's not that important.  Oh, he did state that he is not a megalian idol.  What?  He's not megalian idol.  Oh, megalian...  Megalian...  Megalian...  Megalian...  Megalian...  Megalian...  Megalian...  Meg...  Hold on.  Let me...  Let me pour out a big glass of scotch.  What's that word, Tom? 
[01:58:30]  Tom broke off saying that I'm not megalian idol.  Megalian idol.  Megalian idol.  Megalian...  What the hell is the word?  Megalian...  I'm not Meg Griffin, the old DJ.  No, no, no, no, no.  I would not be so bold or megalomaniacal to suggest that if I go away, all goes to hell. 
[01:59:00]  Brokaw says.  I would not be so bold or megalomaniacal.  That's what I said.  Megalomaniacal.  So, Tom, you're flying the F-14s over Afghanistan, huh?  I'm a fighter jock.  Highway to the danger zone.  Take me right into the danger zone.  Here I am in my F-14. 
[01:59:30]  Hey, Goose, who's butt did you kiss to get in here anyway?  The list is long but distinguished.  Yeah, well, so is my Johnson.  Where's Iceman?  You could be my wingman anytime.  Oh, you're damn right.  Highway to the danger zone.  Look at this, Goose.  This is what I call a target-rich environment.  Look at all the poons hanging around here.  A spider jock to get all the good jigs. 
[02:00:00]  I believe she's lost that loving feeling.  Oh, she has?  I hate it when she does that.  I feel the need.  The need for speed.  You feel the need for speed?  The need for speed.  Rather, you're a pussy.  You could be my wingman, Rather.  Look, it's Viper and Rather in that plane.  In training.  Remember, the hard deck is at 5,000 feet.  Don't go below. 
[02:00:30]  Don't go underneath it.  You could keep it.  Top Gun rules of engagement are written for your safety.  And that of your team.  They're not flexible.  Nor am I.  Am I clear on this?  Hey, Rather, nice pictures you took of that rig.  I've seen Rather fly.  His ego's riding checks his body.  Cash count.  Can't count.  Cash.  What?  I can't even say it. 
[02:01:00]  God, I suck.  Tom, do the Top Gun thing.  Uh-oh, too close for missiles.  I'm switching to guns.  I don't know the edge.  Always where I've earned you.  Take that, you commie mig.  I don't know the edge.  They're all over me.  Goose.  Check our six.  That's right.  Your ego's riding checks your body can't cash. 
[02:01:30]  I know.  Shut up.  It looks written out nice.  Real nice.  Highway to...  It's not good.  Brokaw, engage.  No, it's not good.  I'm coming back to base.  I'm on ready five.  Holy S.  It's Viper. 
[02:02:00]  Viper's up here.  Great.  Oh.  It's just the game sound.  Highway to...  Go screw, Jester.  Hey, let's buzz the tower.  Don't close your eyes anymore when I kiss your little mouth.  And there's no...  Come on, sing with me, Goose.  Right up until you die. 
[02:02:30]  Goose's head hit the canopy.  Yeah.  Poor Meg Ryan.  That's the show it.  And if you screw this up, you'll be flying a cargo plane full of rubber dog crap out of a hot car.  Everybody.  Come on, right over there.  You've lost that love, love, love, love feeling.  Oh, that affectionate feeling.  You've lost that loving feeling. 
[02:03:00]  Now it's gone.  Take me to bed or lose me forever.  I'm not going to sit here and blow sunshine up your butt, Lieutenant.  And then poor Goose died and became a doctor with a brain tumor on ER after he went through that nerdy phase.  Tom Brokaw, Top Gun, NBC Nightly News. 
[02:03:30]  Feel like...  Baby.  Baby.  Take my breath away.  Here's where I hop on my motorcycle and speed over to Kelly McGill.  Kelly McGill.  That blonde woman.  I speed over to a house and have sexual relation with her. 
[02:04:00]  Excuse me, Lieutenant.  Is there something wrong?  Hey, bitch.  That data on the MIG is inaccurate.  I know.  I've seen one of Colossus.  I flip on the bird.  Uh, uh, sorry, Goose.  We happen to see a MIG-28 do a 4G negative dive.  And I'll tell you where I saw it, Charlie, but it's classified.  I tell you, but I'd have to F you in the A.  I tell you, but I'd have to F you in the A.  Take my breath away. 
[02:04:30]  Take my breath away.  Uh, Tyler, request permission for a fly, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah.  Forget it.  I'm coming in for a landing.  God, I wish I could say blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Fly by.  All right, well, Tom doing his job over at F.J.  Take my breath away.  Take my breath away. 
[02:05:00]  I'll come and save you, Iceman.  Oh, he came and saved me?  Who saved who?  It's been so many years.  86, I've got that.  High above the Afghani Desert.  In an F-14, Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  I'm in a flat spin.  I'm in a flat spin.  Goose, let's eject.  Thank you, Tom.  He cracked his skull on the canopy.  Yes, I know. 
[02:05:30]  I always felt it was my fault.  Yeah, I know you did.  It's okay.  I should cry about it now.  No, don't cry.  No, no.  Can I throw his dog tags over the edge of the carrier now?  Don't cry anymore.  We hate when you cry.  Catch my next movie.  Black Hawk down when I take control of one of the Apache helicopters.  Skinnies on the roof.  We have skinnies on the roof.  Watch me, Tom Brokaw, shoot at skinny colored people.  Out of my helicopter.  Me and Ozzy Osbourne at the controls of a Black Hawk helicopter, shooting Negroes in Somalia, Somalia, Somalia, somewhere in Africa. 
[02:06:00]  After I down a scotch at 9 o'clock, 9.15.  Let's make the rally point and time at 9 o'clock.  9 o'clock.  9.15.  With a Black Hawk helicopter.  I'm down.  Thank you, Tom.  Me and Ozzy are going to shoot up some Negroes. 
[02:06:30]  No, Tom.  I'll show that.  Dan or Heather.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  News.  Okay.  Hey, Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on.  Okay, it was me.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News for Opie and Anthony.  Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on.  Speaking of which, why don't we take a break, Tom? 
[02:07:00]  And when we get back, we'll play the audio of somebody from this show.  Of somebody, indeed.  Telling Kathleen to put her goddamn clothes back on.  I want my ticket master charged for this.  As she was completely naked on the stage down there on Broadway, okay?  Just in case you missed it earlier.  Affirmative.  I won.  We got audio proof, and we'll play it again next.  I got the cheddar.  Occupator, ain't it?  Four, three, two.  All right. 
[02:07:30]  He's a black guy.  Ooh, son of a bitch.  Call me daddy.  I'm your cheddar man.  All right.  Hope you like crap.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Jim Brewer on his way up, man.  Oh, yeah.  Did the TRL thing, and he's in the neighborhood.  He said, hey, I got to stop by and say to the boys.  Teen heartthrob, Jim Brewer was on TRL. 
[02:08:00]  So we'll have him in in a couple minutes here.  And we want to play the audio of Kathleen Turner being told to put her goddamn clothes back on.  We're going to do that right now.  But first, we got to talk to Tom from New Orleans.  Tom?  Hey.  How you doing, Tom?  Stupidest man alive.  How are you?  Hey, that's Jim Norton talking to you.  Norton, you suck.  Tom?  Tom, you sound tired today.  You all right?  No, I'm okay.  How was your weekend?  Good?  It was good, boy. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, did you party?  A little bit.  That's great.  Tom, we got a little bit of a dilemma.  What?  What's up?  Clay, buddy.  Well, we got an email from a fan.  Okay.  He says, Extreme Radio keeps advertising, whip it out Wednesday.  Uh-huh.  Not whip them out Wednesday.  You see.  It's whip them out Wednesday.  See, when you're whipping out beautiful cans or luscious, luscious breasts, as Obie artistically  puts it, it's whip them, because there are two of them. 
[02:09:00]  When you put an advertisement for whip it out Wednesday, it makes it sound like you want  a face full of hot.  Or maybe the cancer rate's real high down there in New Orleans.  You understand, Tom, by one line.  I'm sorry.  Now, instead of whip it out Wednesday, what we got?  Whip them out Wednesday. 
[02:09:30]  Whip them.  That's that little apostrophe.  Correct.  With an E and a M.  Correct.  Wednesday.  Gotcha.  Can you hear the promo?  Is that possible?  Yeah.  Well, Tom, are you at work right now?  I'm not that right this second, no.  No, and I can't be there directly, neither.  I'm quite a distance away from the board.  I love this guy.  He's such a cloud of love.  I just love hearing Ant do my impersonation, man. 
[02:10:00]  There's no way I sound like that.  Yeah, you sound like that.  You sound like that.  Tom, I hate to break this to you, but you sound exactly like this.  Yeah.  So how long have those whip it out Wednesday things been running?  There's no such thing as a whip it out Wednesday.  It's whip them out Wednesday.  I promise you.  I will have everything emailed to you tomorrow morning if you'll have them for this show.  And I promise you it says whip them out.  I got to believe the listener that emailed us and said they keep running ads advertising 
[02:10:30]  whip it out Wednesday.  Not whip them out Wednesday.  Uh, no, because I get the whole thing.  It's whip them out.  All right.  Someone wants to say hi to Tom.  Uh, yes, uh, some guy named, uh, Frenchy.  What are you guys doing?  How are you doing?  Y'all set me up.  You miss me, you fat, disgusting piece of ass.  Huh?  With your bad breath, you stink.  I can smell it all the way to Brooklyn, you fat F. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, my God.  I can smell it, you toothless ass.  It's probably your upper lip.  That's because you eat too many of your effing shrimps over there, you dumb F.  You drunken mess.  Holy fag.  Your boyfriends at the station drop some beer on the board.  My boyfriend's your daddy, you French piece of crap.  Drop your pants and let me in.  You suck at the Fortin Island, you dumb F. 
[02:11:30]  Drop your pants and let me in, you solo.  Yeah, I dropped my pants so I can stick it in your hair, you fat F.  And you would love it, you stupid C-sucker.  And your wife, too, she would take it in a dump.  That whole bag.  You have a...  She likes it.  She likes to lick the dirty penny, that fat bitch.  With a fat can.  Huh?  She loves it, that stupid whole bag.  I hope it is.  You fat F.  I hope you die. 
[02:12:00]  In your effing sudden station, that suck ass.  Oh, my ass.  Oh, my ass.  You have pity, right?  You have pity in your ass, you stupid F.  You don't move, you drunk F.  All right.  Hey, Frenchie, wow.  I hope you die.  All right, I want to apologize to Tom.  Tom, um...  Never.  Die, Tom.  Tom, I'm very sorry about Frenchie.  I'm sorry.  The guy's got no cuss.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  All right, Frenchie, hold on a second. 
[02:12:30]  All right.  What, Tom?  Why do y'all set me up with this French homo?  He just calls in every time somebody calls this show that we're trying to talk to.  You're so full of crap.  I'm your nightmare, you eff.  I'm your living nightmare.  It's not like we know who's on the phone there, Tom.  Tom, come on.  Just act like you're...  Speak a little German.  He'll run away real quick.  Believe me.  Hold on.  I'm going to speak some Italian, too, if you want.  Right, go ahead.  Son of a bitch. 
[02:13:00]  Italian?  All right, Frenchie, we don't want to burn you.  One more thing to Tom.  You suck C all day, and I hope you die of him, you whore.  Great, thank you.  Nice parting shot from Frenchie there.  All right, Tom, I'm sorry.  Wow.  Tom, that was awful.  I'm sorry.  You all right with that, Tom?  Yeah, I'm cool.  Oh, I sound a little dejected, don't you?  What?  You sound unhappy there.  It sort of gets to you that being beat up by a French faggot, don't it? 
[02:13:30]  There, Tom.  What do you want me to do?  Exchange barbs with some imbecile who can't even speak the language?  He did a fine job just then speaking the language, Tom.  I think his message came through loud and what they say, clear.  His abbreviations were great, too.  We might have to fly Tom up to New York.  It's a price Frenchie one day.  I'll beat his ass if I fly up there.  You know that, huh?  All right, Tom.  Thank you, Tom.  We've got to get back to the radio.  Bye-bye.  Whip him out Wednesday.  You know that dog don't hunt? 
[02:14:00]  Remember that, Tom.  Whip him out Wednesday.  I'll remember it.  Norton.  I'm good.  I'm too smart.  No, what do you mean?  You're going to get me and hang up on me.  I was just trying to tell you you're an ass.  Thank you, sir.  I'll agree.  All right, Tom.  There he goes.  My God.  Wow.  Frenchie came on with all barrels.  Wow.  Oh, man.  Did he friggin' pummel him.  After his last attempt. 
[02:14:30]  He came back.  I thought we were going to, you know, have to get rid of Frenchie there.  You'd think the kids were playing Little League together.  All right, wait.  Carl is saying they're lying down there.  Carl, what's up?  Yeah, Tom is effing lying, man.  We have, like, some lingerie lunch on Wednesdays, and it says come to Whip It Out Wednesday.  It don't say whip them out.  Whip It Out.  Whip It Out Wednesday.  Yeah, if you say whip it out, there's going to be some guy whipping out his mule. 
[02:15:00]  Well, what the hell am I going to do?  I already printed it on 15,000 window clings.  But Tom's up in line, man.  Tell him to go back to the quarter and drink some more beers.  All right, bro.  The quality.  You know who did the same thing?  Yeah.  Mancow in Chicago stole the wow thing.  Yeah.  But called it Whip It Out Wednesday as well.  Whip It Out.  Yeah, if you want a big, fat hog being whipped out while you're driving home, go for it. 
[02:15:30]  Jim Brewer in the studio.  Gene Heartthrob.  Jim Brewer, fresh off his appearance on TRL.  We were watching, Dick.  You and Carson.  How is Carson?  Dude, he's all right.  Dude, how's Carson?  Stop.  Stop.  I can't.  I'm not going to be.  Can I touch you?  He's all right, man.  He's a cool guy.  Carson, he's so cool.  Cool with a K-W-E-L cool.  Ray Sharky, your manager now?  He's a dick.  Wow.  Nice.  Nice reference.  Why are you on it?  Come on, Rick. 
[02:16:00]  We ran out.  No, it was good, man.  Did you smell any Tara on his fingers?  Or is it worn off by now?  Who was that chick who went on and she started, like, dancing?  Really?  We could just catch a couple of views.  We were doing a little program here.  We called it the O.P.  The Anthony Show.  Oh, wait, Brewer's on.  We've got to stop the show.  We're down in the station.  We actually were all looking over, but we couldn't watch the whole thing.  What happened?  How was it?  It went on.  It was like, it's just weird.  As little kids going, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. 
[02:16:30]  They don't know, man.  They just want to be on camera.  Do you get any numbers, man?  I've got a couple.  We got a little 15-year-old dumb.  She's kind of on a stage where she doesn't know where she's at.  That's good.  The retarded ones.  We have audio of Brewer from TRL.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen, my next guest is so funny.  Comedy Central is devoting a whole day to him.  You're going to laugh just immediately.  Here's Jim Brewer, everybody.  Oh.  You hear the high-pitched screams, guys?  You hear that?  You sound like a beetle.  That's right.  You sound like when the Beatles hit the top.  14-year-olds enjoying the goat man. 
[02:17:00]  What are you doing?  I'm feeling it.  Yeah.  It just proves that kids are getting higher.  Look at them going.  Two o'clock.  They had some half-baked fans back there.  I should have taken my shirt off.  What have you been doing?  We haven't had you on the show in, like, it's been four years.  I should have taken my shirt off.  Yeah, I remember the last time you were here.  Dude, the last time I was on there. 
[02:17:30]  Big Backstreet fan, I see.  The Backstreet Boys, right?  Why play tape of Jim when we have him live in the studio?  Jim has a body like E.T.  What are you taking your shirt off?  Look at that.  He's really taking his shirt off.  Look at that.  Jesus.  I'm on the night train.  You are.  You are the most hairless individual I think I've ever seen.  You don't have a hair on you, do you?  Not even nothing, man.  Look at that.  You like that? 
[02:18:00]  You could make an ass.  He's murking his belly into an ass.  I could get a vagina and an ass.  Look, he's making various genitalia.  That's very, very nice.  Stan, I'm out.  Kids are home.  I'm hanging out in the seat.  Hey, if anyone needs med tickets, let me know.  I got tonight's game.  Oh, yeah?  Yes.  You going?  Do you guys want to go?  I'm not going.  Well, I would love to, but now it's too late.  If anyone wants, just call up and... 
[02:18:30]  We'll just go outside the studio, Brooklyn Diner.  We'll hand them out.  There you go.  No problem.  First person down there.  Hey, we have to play this audio or our listener is going to kill us.  We don't know if we're going to be able to play it after today.  Bro, did you hear what happened?  No, I did not.  Sorry.  Well, listen.  All right.  We'll explain it to you and we'll play it.  Steve from FoundryMusic.com went and saw Kathleen Turner and The Graduate on Broadway  with Jason Biggs.  I know.  No big deal, right?  And Alicia Silverstone.  But Kathleen Turner decides she needs to be naked in this play. 
[02:19:00]  She does a nude scene.  And she drops her towel about 15 minutes in and you see her complete full frontal nudity.  Okay.  Steve was horrified.  He came back with a full report saying this lady should not be naked.  Looked like a linebacker nude with an afro...  A pool rack.  A pool rack full of afro hair in her lap.  So we went on the radio and said, you know what?  Someone should have the balls to tell her to put her goddamn clothes back on.  And then we decided to give a prize to the first listener that would do this for us. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  So then Kathleen Turner's people called us personally and they want to sue us.  Sue you?  They're completely livid, pissed off.  How dare you do this?  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  So we made a promise to our general manager that we wouldn't give out a prize.  But then we asked for a couple tickets.  So our listeners came by with some tickets to see The Graduate, Jim.  Nice.  And then we went on there and said that something may go down this week.  All right?  We did it Friday night. 
[02:20:00]  Three people.  Three people.  Various places.  All over the theater with recording devices, my friend.  Just in case you have a fail safe.  The redundant systems in place just in case one guy gets pinched.  We got other versions.  So it was like Mission Impossible.  The moment came and the person that did this did not falter.  They projected like they were on the stage.  Now you're going to know this person by hearing his voice.  But for some reason he doesn't want... 
[02:20:30]  Doesn't want his name out there.  Right now.  Right now.  As soon as you hear the voice you're going to go, oh dude.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's kind of obvious.  Yes.  It's very obvious.  All right.  I don't know what he's thinking.  The listeners guessed who it was like 95% of the time on instant feedback.  It would be like if James Earl Jones did the prank.  Right.  Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on.  Plus.  So...  It wasn't me.  I don't want to talk about this. 
[02:21:00]  So we played this audio earlier, but we got to play it again because we have a whole new audience.  So basically, this first clip, you're going to hear this guy say, Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes on.  But during the play.  Oh yeah.  You hear the whole goddamn thing.  They're performing the play.  They're performing the graduate.  She is naked on the stage.  People are hanging out and paying a lot of money.  This is the black person.  Right.  And this person stands up and screams it, dude.  Let's hear this.  So the first piece of tape you're going to hear is pretty far back from the stage. 
[02:21:30]  One of our plants far back from the stage.  Far back from the person and the stage just in case you had to get a little audience reaction.  So here it is as it went down on Friday night.  All right.  Get on the bed.  Play in the background.  Okay.  Get on the bed.  Okay.  I want you to know that I'm a baby. 
[02:22:00]  Oh my God.  Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on.  And you hear the...  Can you do one more time?  Well, we got three versions of it.  Yes, three different versions.  We were on a three-camera shoot.  So that was the first plant.  The second plant was close to the guy as he stood up to do it, but he wasn't close enough 
[02:22:30]  because we didn't want him to get caught.  So he's about, I don't know, about four or five rows back from the guy, about 15 rows  back from the stage.  Listen for the gasp of the woman gasping.  Listen for air.  It sucked the air out of her.  So here's the second plant.  Hold on.  This is wrong.  Oh my God.  Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on.  Jesus Christ.  Who said the Jesus Christ though? 
[02:23:00]  Was that him?  I don't know.  I don't know.  We don't know if it's part of the play or just someone pissed off.  We can all play and reacting.  We really don't know.  That's great.  What a dick.  Jesus Christ.  Or it could have been them just ad-libbing like, oh, Jesus Christ.  I can't believe that just happened while I'm trying to do it.  I'm trying to do a goddamn Broadway production here.  I know how hard I rehearse for this.  All right.  Go ahead.  So now the third recording device was on the guy. 
[02:23:30]  And my favorite.  That stood up in front of a packed house and said,  Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes on.  You can really get a feel for how loud he yelled this when you hear it from this one.  And how close he was to the stage.  He's about 20, 25 feet away from her.  The recording device right in his shirt pocket.  Listen to this.  Okay.  It's on the bed.  Oh, God.  This rock's over. 
[02:24:00]  Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on.  What?  What?  What?  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  You know what?  I think that Jesus Christ was Jason Biggs commenting about what just happened to the audience.  Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on.  Yeah, someone suggested he sounded like a father standing there as the daughter maybe was walking 
[02:24:30]  from a bedroom to the bathroom and didn't have enough clothes on and embarrassed the father.  It's like, Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes on.  What's wrong with you?  Put your goddamn clothes on, you fat bastard.  Put them on before I have you with some French bread.  You can hear this person standing up and everything.  You hear, like, that ruffling of the clothing as he's getting up, the play in the background, 
[02:25:00]  and you just know what's coming.  And they stopped the play for a couple seconds and then just kept on going.  So here it is again from the guy that did it.  Okay.  It's on the bed.  Oh, God.  This is wrong.  Oh, my God.  Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on.  Oh, my God.  I love it. 
[02:25:30]  I love it.  I love you.  Oh, my God.  Jeff Wayne, put your goddamn clothes back on.  How big is his yam bag?  God damn it.  Holy cow.  How big is your yam bag after me?  That is about to rush.  Fire.  That is.  Look at Chris saying the first plant sounded like he was playing What's in My Pants before  he took the tape recorder out.  Well, we explained that earlier. 
[02:26:00]  It was like, you know, Fredo hit that gun, man.  Yeah, the first guy, Fredo, fumbling the gun as Don Corleone takes five in the back.  Five shots and he's still alive.  Still alive.  She's still naked.  But what you're hearing is this plant that's far away from the guy doing it, trying to get  the recording device out of his pocket that he had hidden and, you know, raising it up  in the air real fast.  Right.  To get a good recording.  All right.  It gets better.  It gets better.  All right.  Because he's got some. 
[02:26:30]  Just when you think he's got the most balls he could possibly have, he conjures up some  more balls.  It gets worse than this?  Oh, yeah.  Well, then he sits down and figures, all right, I'll just enjoy the rest of the play.  Now you got Mr. Usher Guy coming over, trying to whisper.  It's hard to hear.  So we'll play the tape for you and then we'll give you little subtitles of what the usher  was saying.  And also, you got to visualize that this person is trying to talk to the people around him,  but no one wants to acknowledge that he even exists, Jim. 
[02:27:00]  Okay.  All right.  So he's talking not to himself.  He's talking to people around him and the usher.  Oh, I just got to bend here to show a few wild loads.  This place is terrible.  Yes.  I think that's a wild advice.  You look like the kind of guy that's a fireball.  I think this is offensive.  What?  It's offensive.  No, I'm not going to get up.  No.  I think this is offensive.  Now the guy's going, get up, get up, get up, let's get out of here. 
[02:27:30]  Come on, get up, get up.  Listen, listen.  Come with the, come this way.  Come this way, please.  You're being ejected from the theater.  Please, come this way.  We'll give you a refund.  Yeah.  Yes, I do.  It's necessary for her to take her clothes off.  I'm offended.  Come this way, please.  Men in the way.  They like each other.  I'm sure.  Oh, we found each other.  We certainly did.  I'm sure about the script, but Max, you get to drive home. 
[02:28:00]  That's the good one.  I'm going to have to take you out physically if you don't come.  The guy couldn't say it low enough.  Play that part again.  Keep it.  Fuck.  Now that I know it.  Listen to me, you mother.  I am going to kick your ass if you don't come with me.  Do you want, I can't speak any lower.  But I will take your f***ing b****s and put them in your f***ing mouth. 
[02:28:30]  And this guy wasn't too observant because this person is taking his lapel kind of and going like this.  Speak into the flower, man.  Speak into the flower.  All right.  I rewound the tape.  All right.  You're disturbing everyone else. 
[02:29:00]  Ben, the guest is still waiting.  Come on, Ben.  Ben, it's a hard...  Why does she have to be naked?  On what grounds?  You're disturbing everyone else.  You're disturbing everybody.  Dude.  I just want to tell you this.  I love you.  You're so cute.  Your balls are showing.  Come with me to the back room. 
[02:29:30]  I'll get naked for you.  He's whispering sweet nothings in his ear.  I'm going to beat you, silly.  I swear to you.  I swear I will F you up.  Come with me.  Come with me.  Let's fly.  Let's fly away.  All right.  Listen, listen.  I'm not moving to the portal.  If you're offended, leave.  I'll give you a refund.  All right.  Let's go. 
[02:30:00]  This is ridiculous.  So he goes, if you're offended, leave.  Leave.  And I'll give you a refund.  I'll give you a refund.  And he goes, okay, let's go.  I'm offended.  He should have got juiced up and went in there.  That was when Joe had a run-in with the usher.  For example, reference.  Wow.  Nice.  Wow.  He went to the lobby to get a refund and a jelly donut.  Wow. 
[02:30:30]  Gaffa, let go.  And as they're pulling him out, he's yelling, I am not resisting arrest.  I'm offended.  Maybe he went in to meet his handler.  I'm offended.  All right.  Now, the next clip, now he decides he's going to leave, but he has to get through the whole  row to leave.  So now he's talking to every person he passes.  Great.  And none of them will acknowledge that this guy is talking to him. 
[02:31:00]  They're horrified and very frightened.  So what you hear is him trying to get some reaction from the people around him, and no  one will pay attention to him.  Listen.  This way.  Go.  Ridiculous.  There's no reason for her to be naked.  I can't believe you people watch this.  This is ridiculous.  It's not necessary for her to be naked. 
[02:31:30]  This is ridiculous in that sense.  All right.  Now they're out of the theater in the lobby.  Can I just say something really quick?  A lot of people think we went to Best Of because Brewer's here at this hour.  Oh, really?  No.  We're still live.  It is April 15th, Tax Day, 2002.  When people...  Yeah, Brewer.  What did they do?  6.31, Anthony.  It is 6.31.  Yeah, yeah.  So it's not a rerun. 
[02:32:00]  No.  We are here live.  And by the way, not one tax joke today on the O.P. and Anthony show.  No.  Because I'm the tax man.  We're pretty proud of that.  Hey, let's broadcast from a post office.  He should be beaten with his double guitar.  Awful song.  Did you do your taxes?  Maybe you should leave and get your taxes in order.  All right.  So now he gets the refund.  And this line coming up, Brewer, is classic as he gets his refund. 
[02:32:30]  So he made money doing this.  And he didn't pay for the tickets.  No.  No.  He made money.  Listeners brought the tickets down.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Still.  We need to be putting some of this money.  Plus the Ticketmaster Service charge.  Oh, there it is.  We need to be putting on the ticket.  Right.  That's awesome.  All right.  Fine. 
[02:33:00]  Ridiculous.  Don't you think there should be some disclaimer about the nudity?  I mean, that's ridiculous.  It's unnecessary.  People should be ashamed of yourself.  No.  You have a nice evening.  It's offensive.  You know what's great?  Like you said earlier, he handled it perfectly.  Exactly.  Because if he was a goofy guy like, hey, dude, I'm just having fun or something, they would 
[02:33:30]  have really turned the screws.  The way he played it was like some kind of a lunatic religious nut or some guy that they  just best, you know, all right, let's just get him out of here.  This is offensive.  This is offensive.  Like, yeah, there's a problem.  I'll go to the police.  This is the type of guy that will come back and set your theater on fire.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, you just give him his goddamn refund, get out.  I was waiting for Kathleen.  As he sneaks into Kathleen Turner's apartment, I told you to put your clothes back on. 
[02:34:00]  It sounds like you should be kidnapping James Caan.  Oh, wow.  You're offensive.  He's a bunch of her and her June boxer.  We're your number one fan.  Burning the script.  Can make it again.  Ow!  We have one more clip.  It's really fast as he's walking down the street after this whole thing.  All right.  Nobody turned around.  Nobody said a goddamn thing.  F***ing wimps. 
[02:34:30]  Theater goers are fags.  Because no one really said anything to him.  No one really said it.  There was a couple of gasps, but there was nobody that wanted to say anything to him.  Theater reminds me of like a cruise boat, man.  It's really just white trash, but they sell white trash and they put on their prom dresses  and stuff like, oh, we're going to go see cats.  Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.  What the F is this for $150? 
[02:35:00]  I'd rather see Barry walk out.  Hey, my Barry does.  What's going on?  Have you checked out things?  It's on fire.  Hey, Emery's all alone.  Hey, I've got a great gig for you.  That's Barry's business.  All you've got to do is put on a cat suit.  Is that all right?  Hey, John, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, William?  Real good.  Good.  I just wanted to, you know, I'm an actor from Philly, 
[02:35:30]  and I do a lot of like off, off, off, off, like a Hoboken theater off-Broadway.  Yeah.  And there's a bunch of websites.  They have a lot of postings and a lot of them have some auditions and whatnot.  And there's got to be like two dozen websites, like of the posting, the forums.  All they're talking about, like all last week was about, you know, you guys.  And there's got to be like, you know, a lookout for, you know, these evil ONA people  that are going to destroy the legacy of the theater and stuff. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, the legacy.  Oh, it's hilarious.  However, on the same token, there's a couple other, like, people are chiming in,  like, in those forums that are saying that, well, you know,  Giuliani was trying to clean up, you know, New York for their ship.  There should be any nudity, especially casting.  John, send us some of the websites and some of the postings, all right, so we can read them.  Well, I'm on my way home now.  I'm in the car.  I'll send them to you.  All right, cool.  Thanks, John.  All right, cool.  Thank you.  The only way you could ruin theater is if you said no sea-sucking permitted. 
[02:36:30]  There should be four people on Broadway.  All right, let's take a break.  Brewer in the house.  We're going to play What Did We Learn Next, though.  End up.  Next, what did you learn today?  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  U.M.D.E.W.  We're back with the O.P. and...  Yeah, okay.  O.E.Y.?  Oh, boy.  Easy for you to say.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  There you go.  Wow.  I haven't had one of those in a while.  I want to thank Andrew W.K. for stopping by today, Anthony.  Yes. 
[02:37:00]  Cool guy, right?  Yes.  Jim Brewer for stopping by today.  Hey, Brewer, when's that special, man?  Sunday, Sunday.  Sunday on Comedy Central, right?  10 o'clock?  10 o'clock, Hammer.  Thank you.  All right, very good.  Want to play What Did We Learn Next?  What Did We Learn Next on the O.N.A. show today?  No, you're going to have to leave.  Hey, sorry.  If anyone wants tonight's Met tickets, I'm sorry.  Go downstairs.  I don't want to be stuck with these efforts.  All right.  I think we sent someone down with your Met tickets.  They're good seats, too.  No, I got them right here, man.  Oh, you still got them on you? 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  Met fans represents.  Holy crap, he's killing us.  Tom, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Today, I learned that the Central Scrutinizer is an usher at The Graduate.  Stop a reference.  Brilliant.  That was really good.  Yo, Norton.  It's the Central Scrutinizer.  Again.  We leave Joe in his seat at the theater, yelling things out to a naked woman.  Joe got in trouble with an usher, usher, usher. 
[02:38:00]  Mike, you don't come to a play and yell things like that.  Why doesn't it work?  Draw chips for everybody.  And Kathleen Turner will kick your tongue out.  You goddamn hecklers really make me laugh.  No, you don't yell at me naked.  I yell at you naked. 
[02:38:30]  Kathleen Turner don't have that kind of body muscle anymore.  Oh, God, Neil Mulgrey.  She's the greatest man ever.  Oh, of course.  Kevin from D.C.  I learned today Asian people say, clinkle, clinkle.  Little boys coming out of the confessional walk duck-legged.  Opie and Anthony did not go to Best Of, even though Brewer is in studio at 6.30.  And everyone but me knows who yelled at Kathleen Turner.  Yes. 
[02:39:00]  He's banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Players couldn't get a drink at the table.  We had a little argument, Freddie and me.  How you doing, Freddie Corleone?  Tom, you're the consigliere.  That's real good.  I love it.  I was as much a heckler to her as you and Mike.  Come on, Mom's naked.  She made some pasta.  Get your sausage, your meatballs. 
[02:39:30]  Eric, what's going on?  Wine.  I learned two things today.  Number one, you can use the First Amendment to get refunds from lousy plays.  Yep.  And Kathleen Turner's womb might have been shocked barren on Friday.  All right, all right, all right.  Oh, brother.  Let's go to Justin.  What's up, bro?  Monday, Tuesday, Sunday, Friday.  No, I thought you were.  What's going on, boys?  Go ahead, Justin. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, I learned today that because of Steve from Founder Music, Kathleen Turner now has  a landing strip.  Yeah.  And there's a tape recorder on the grassy knoll.  Very good.  Thank you.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right.  I come for Kathleen Turner.  For Kathleen Turner.  I am Enzo, the becker.  I come for a Kathleen Turner.  You know, Kathleen, people are going to come here to heckle her. 
[02:40:30]  Help me move her quickly.  Wow.  Holy crap.  Chris, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Today, I learned Nolan has a high rate of breast cancer.  Yeah.  Kathleen should have left a dryer door on.  Yeah.  And Fredo had an easier time with the gun.  Very good.  Hey, Ant.  Anthony.  Sorry.  Sorry.  No, no, no, no.  Seriously.  I figured out why you hate the dead shows.  You're just jealous because Rocka never got hairy, unwashed hippie chicks. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, that's true.  You guys suck.  Later.  You're fat, Kathleen.  Love your grandson, Frank.  Oh, that makes me happy.  They heckle Kathleen again.  Son of a bitch.  Son of a bitch.  Sorry, I heckled you, Kathleen.  I'm getting too old for my job.  You heckle her one more time.  I'll kill you.  I'll kill you. 
[02:41:30]  You heckled Kathleen at the causeway.  She's dead.  Now you've had your refund.  Look how they heckled Kathleen Turner.  Look how they heckled Kathleen Turner.  Give her a breast lift.  I don't want his mother to see her like this.  I wish I could do an impression. 
[02:42:00]  I heard that when he heckled Kathleen, he looked at her.  You're spilling it.  A little orange in her mouth.  I'm just spilling it.  Senator Kathleen.  Governor Kathleen.  The person of auntie.  Anthony from West Orange.  As I learned, Earl is the only black man who can't drive a getaway car. 
[02:42:30]  Kathleen Turner, it is an honor to be here at your show, which you are showing.  And your body is a masculine body.  It makes me happy.  I guess we got our godfather reference in today.  We was all real proud of you, Kathleen. 
[02:43:00]  In the play and all.  No Emo Phillips reference today, though.  No.  And no Wesley Willis song today.  Nah, but there's plenty.  All right, we'll play another one tomorrow.  Sheep lover from Jersey.  I learned today, you ego can't cash checks that your body counts.  All right, screw you.  Don't ever let anybody else in the theater know what you're thinking again.  That was screwing. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, that makes me happy.  I'm so happy deep down.  Here's one for Jim as we leave.  Glenn the Tool from Jersey.  Hepatitis-filled squirt gun is going to be the next Nortonism everyone will be using.  All right.  Oh, Kathleen Turner, you won't see her no more.  She was beautiful.  With his loud voice.  All right, we've got to get out of here. 
[02:44:00]  And he heckles her to make me look ridiculous.  We're out of here.  Don't forget to check out Brewer's Sunday Night on Comedy Central at 10 o'clock.  The humor gone too far.  And check out Andrew W.K.'s CD.  It rocks, and it's cool.  He's a nice guy.  I just lost my mind.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  We'll do it again tomorrow.  Oh, the Maury Povich audio.  Yes, very funny.  Maury hiding midgets around his studio. 
[02:44:30]  I don't know what he was doing.  Pajeria kids.  Little Pajeria kids.  We'll have the audio tomorrow.  Oh, he got you.  He got you.  Oh, boy.  Later.  Oh. </pre>
