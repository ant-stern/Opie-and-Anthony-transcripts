<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

This episode of "After Opie and Anthony Live," hosted by Sam Roberts, featured a packed studio and a chaotic mix of segments.  The show began or included a "Couch of Zilches" segment, where three listeners – Brian, David, and Eric – were in-studio.  Much of this segment involved good-natured, though sometimes pointed, ribbing between the Zilches and Sam Roberts, often revolving around their interactions with the show's intimidating security guard, "Club Soda Kenny."  The studio also hosted a star-studded lineup of guests including Amy Schumer, Rich Voss, Bonnie McFarlane, and Tom Papa, along with the regular hosts Opie and Anthony, and Jim Norton.  A surprise appearance by Aaron Paul added to the already eclectic mix.

A substantial portion of the broadcast was dominated by a contentious phone call with a long-time caller, Bobo. Bobo had persistently tried to convince Opie to attend a Mets game with him, resulting in Opie's visibly bad mood.  The on-air conversation with Bobo revealed misinterpretations of Opie's tweets by Bobo, leading to further frustration from Opie.  Another caller, Danny, interjected with offensive language and derogatory remarks about Bobo's intelligence. Bobo also expressed confusion and defensiveness regarding the "Couch of Zilches" selection process and Opie's angry reaction.  The episode concluded with E-Rock offering lunch to the Zilches.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is After O&A Live. Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Alright.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live. A lot of the craziness has calmed down in here.  But I have to say, yeah, unfortunately he's right.  Eric, I mean, these guys, these Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton guys,  they certainly packed a week of radio into two days, did they not?  That's our new deal.  Is it?  Yeah.  We only have to do two days a week, but they have to be content full?  Well, we weren't allowed to do three days and take two off. 
[00:00:30]  So with this deal, we just do two days and take three off.  What about the other two for the weekend?  There's seven days in a week.  You don't work seven days.  So you're saying we take four off?  The weekend doesn't count as part of the work week.  Oh, so we get the weekends and then...  We get three days off, and then we work two days a week.  And then we get the weekend, and then we get the three.  The weekend's just automatically given.  Of course.  Well, not to all of us.  Some of us still, like dopes, come in here on a Saturday.  Well, that's your fault.  It's after Opie and Anthony Live.  I'm Sam Roberts. 
[00:01:00]  I mean, listen.  Today's show from top to bottom was one to have.  If you've missed it, the replay starts at 3 o'clock.  It'll be up on Audible.  But at one point, we had a couch full of zilches.  Amy Schumer was in here.  Rich Voss was in here.  Bonnie was in here.  Tom Papa was in here.  Norton was in here.  And, of course, Opie and Anthony were in here.  There were more people than mics.  The couch of zilches has stayed.  You're David.  David, yep.  Well, you can talk into that thing that's up there. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, sorry about that.  And I'll turn on those couch mics because, David, you were allowed to come up to the table  because you were polite.  Your name is Eric.  Yes, sir.  You shouldn't be punished, but for whatever reason, you're back on the couch.  I'm sorry.  You haven't really done anything.  I'm glad you'd be here, Sam.  You haven't.  Yeah.  And then you're...  Brian.  Brian.  You got a little ahead of yourself.  You had to be punished.  E-Rock told me to sit there.  Well, I mean, how long have you been listening to the show, Brian?  A long time.  And did you really think you're going to side with E-Rock? 
[00:02:00]  That's the...  Hey, look.  You wanted to kick a fireman off the console there.  That's your fault.  What's fire?  This is a console.  It's not a fire engine.  Like, if I was in a firehouse, you wouldn't let me slide down the pole out of the road?  No, I would.  Really?  Absolutely.  Come on by.  Come back to...  Come up to the table.  Come up to the table.  If that means...  If you're saying I could slide...  Eric, you're going to have to stay there.  Damn it.  Sorry, buddy.  I'm the only zilch left on the couch.  Let me ask David.  Are you David?  No, no.  I'm not...  You're not the other guy?  I did the same thing because we were supposed to...  David from Israel, who's a regular caller on the show, he was supposed to come in today. 
[00:02:30]  He called us and said he was going to come in.  And I was walking through the hall and this guy, David, was here.  And this guy looks like a...  You don't look like you're from Israel, Brian.  No.  You look like a firefighter.  Thank you.  But you don't look like you're from Israel.  Eric, you're too young.  Yeah.  And the other zilch who disappeared...  I don't know where she went, actually.  Yeah, who knows?  She walked out.  Yeah, she didn't want to have any part of the after show.  But she is a girl, so I knew she wasn't David. 
[00:03:00]  So I walked by and I was like, are you David?  And you were like, yeah.  I was like, well, good to meet you.  What were you...  I thought you were David from Israel.  Well, yes, if I was David.  I said, yes, I didn't know David from Israel was coming in today.  So when I said nice to meet you, like pointed you out from the rest of the group, what were  you thinking?  I thought you were just busting my balls.  I just picked one of the names from rolling sheets and just...  Oh, and just decided I'm going to pick on you.  Yeah, exactly.  No, I thought you were somebody else.  Your guests here...  I'm not here to pick on any of you.  You see the Ron and Fez interns.  They're setting up the studio.  What is it like? 
[00:03:30]  You guys are obviously, all three of you, big fans of the show.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  How long have you guys been listening?  Since any W days.  Long time.  Since AAF.  Longer.  And Eric?  Since Free FM.  Okay, so shorter than the other two.  You're not good with the whole like...  Oh, yeah.  Well, I mean, I listen to old stuff on YouTube and stuff.  So I'm, you know...  So you started listening when we were on Free FM and K-Rock.  Yes.  And then you came over to Satellite Radio.  Yeah, absolutely.  See, that's a whole new class of listeners that we don't take account for.  Because you hear like AAF every now and then, NEW a lot. 
[00:04:00]  But there's a whole bunch of people that listen to us on K-Rock.  It's an amazing thing.  We've been through so much as a show.  And so you've obviously all been listening for years.  When you come in here, what strikes you?  It's just unbelievable, man.  I'm an official studio.  Did you not think we had a real studio?  Yeah, an official studio.  No, but I'm saying it's like crazy to actually be in a real radio studio after.  Because that's what I'd love to do for my career. 
[00:04:30]  So it's like, you know, I'm seeing all the characters of the show and everything.  It's just...  So you're very excited because you want to be in radio.  You're the guy who said you're doing college radio.  Yes.  And you've never been in a real radio studio before.  No.  What's your college radio studio like?  Uh, I mean, it's not too bad, but it's, you know, it's not even close to the size of  this, you know.  Look.  Got, you know, about five mics and that's, you know.  We love it here at SiriusXM.  It's the best place to be.  But you should have seen our studio on 57th Street. 
[00:05:00]  I missed out on those years.  I mean, three of these could have fit in there.  Wow.  And what about you guys?  You guys have been listening even longer, especially you, David, forever.  Like, when you come in here, because, I mean, really, radio is a weird thing because you're  just hearing voices.  Yeah.  When you actually not only see them, but you're seeing everything happen live, what strikes  you guys?  Well, one of the things I love now is when Anthony or Jim do voices, actually seeing the faces  that they make that go along with the voices.  Because you just, you don't even think of it. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  You don't realize there's kind of the facial expressions going along with it, too.  Yeah.  Just the way, all the stuff that happens in the background during the show, I mean, like,  when the broadcast is going on, people are bringing stuff in and out, you never even  pick it up when you're listening.  Right.  You don't even think, you don't even think to think, is this going on right now?  What about you, Brian?  Yeah.  Just, I was thinking about, kind of like what David was saying, but Chip with the Chip voice  and the Chip face.  You like the...  I actually pictured that face when he was doing Chip.  You like seeing the transformations that Jim actually goes through in an instant way. 
[00:06:00]  It's a shame that he doesn't do Ted as much anymore, because Eric, E-Rock, I should  say, you could back me up.  I know you're probably the biggest Ted fan I know.  I love Ted.  I know.  He's like, Eric, because Eric's job on the show is to cut worst of, and Jim, and then  we do voiceover for it later, and so I go over the list of what we're doing voiceover  for, and Jim will do Ted for like 25 seconds, and Eric has it listed as worst of, and I  go, what are we doing?  Like, we're, yeah, Eric, don't worry about it. 
[00:06:30]  This is going to be great.  We'll just put it at the end of something.  It was great.  It was Ted.  I'm like, okay.  So, like, Eric, you could say, like, in terms of a physical transformation that Norton  goes through, Ted's was way more extreme than any of the characters that he's been doing  lately.  When Ted comes around, like, Jim's head flies back into his neck, and then he, like, sucks  in his face.  Yeah.  So it's all tight, and then he spits when he talks.  Yeah, and that voice just comes out, but he doesn't move.  He pivots on his feet, so his whole shoulders and his neck turn this way and turn that way. 
[00:07:00]  It's really funny to watch.  And you guys got quite a surprise coming in here.  Not only do we have a Hollywood guest from Breaking Bad, Aaron Paul.  I think that's his name, right?  Aaron Paul?  I guess.  Eric, can you back me up on that?  He doesn't have his headphones on.  Is the guy Aaron Paul, right?  That's his name.  Yes.  Yeah.  I watch Breaking Bad.  I know who he is on Breaking Bad.  I just don't know him personally.  So we have Aaron Paul and a Hollywood guest, but then you also get to see Tom Papa, Voss,  Bonnie, Amy Schumer. 
[00:07:30]  Who was your favorite, other than Norton, Opie, and Anthony, who was your favorite person  to actually see perform on the radio today?  Well, I actually, I just saw Voss perform on stage last week, and he killed.  He was awesome.  But it was really cool to see Amy here, because she's, I, I, I.  I don't think I'm speaking in an editorial, but I don't really like female comics a lot  much.  Yeah, I mean, I'd say that's a, uh, something that, but she is, she just, you share with  the audience.  Yeah.  She breaks that mold. 
[00:08:00]  Well, that's the thing, too.  That was what, Bonnie is the same way.  Bonnie also performed last week.  I saw her with Rich at, uh, Stand Up New York.  Yeah.  And she killed.  Yeah, there's a, there's a, see, we always say, we have said in the past, we don't always  say, we have said in the past that we don't like female comedians, but there's an exception.  There's multiple exceptions, I guess, to every rule.  Like, there are a few really good female stand-up comedians.  Right.  Well, they break the mold of what's taboo to talk about.  Yeah.  It's not relationships and my period and my mom wants me to get married. 
[00:08:30]  It's you bringing up all this stuff.  Bonnie McFarlane is working on a documentary trying to dispel just an attitude like you  have.  Yeah.  You know, hopefully you'll watch it and change.  What about for you, David?  I think it was Amy coming in.  You like the, you like the spontaneity because people, people like, when they talk to me,  they assume that a lot of the spontaneity, quote unquote, is talked about on the air, but  we've planned it.  Oh, that, I assume usually.  It's not.  And like, you guys have seen that live. 
[00:09:00]  Like, there is no fake spontaneity to the point where like, we'll write notes to Opie and  Anthony and saying, don't say this on the air.  And then they just read the notes that you hand them.  Like, there is no fake spontaneity on the show.  You know, is that something that you?  I, I, I sometimes, I mean, I know they're, they're generally honest, but it seems like  I thought sometimes, you know, they probably would have seen them walking by in the hallway  and then, you know, knew that they were here.  Right.  And they said, oh, you know, it's surprising that they're coming in the studio.  No.  No, that, that was very cool.  I think also because I haven't started watching Breaking Bad yet. 
[00:09:30]  It's, I have it on my Netflix queue, but I haven't watched it yet.  So.  Are you going to now?  Oh yeah.  And you're going to be like, oh, I saw that guy.  Absolutely.  It's exciting.  Eric, um, this show, it's interesting for you because, uh, you're a guy who's trying  to get into radio.  Yes, sir.  Um, this, Opie and Anthony constantly talk about how much they hate radio.  What a horrible medium this is.  Yeah.  And just yesterday, they, they were talking to Dennis Leary about how badly they wanted 
[00:10:00]  to get out of radio.  They were basically just begging him to put them on any TV show.  Yeah.  It's, uh.  Does that sway you?  Yeah.  I mean, I do double think it.  Are you thinking to yourself, well, what am I doing?  No, absolutely.  But, uh, and that's kind of why I'm doing the college radio thing.  At least I can say I tried doing radio and did it.  But, uh, I mean, I'd love to make a career out of it, but, uh.  Well, I'll tell you this, Eric.  Yeah.  You keep at it with college radio.  Do as much college radio as you can.  And when you get out, maybe you'll, maybe, well, no, keep doing Scorch, too. 
[00:10:30]  You got to learn everything.  Because maybe you'll find a place where they'll let you do shows for free.  And that is really the dream.  Yeah.  Yeah, Eric, I think you're the last generation to actually get, like, real radio jobs out  of college.  Yeah, I mean, it's, uh.  No, not you, Eric.  You're not going to get any radio jobs.  I'm talking about sex bagel.  I'm still confused now, too.  E-Rock, you're right.  E-Rock, you're probably the last, like, guys who could come out of college and actually  make money in radio.  Yeah, I just lucked in on that bottom rung there. 
[00:11:00]  Lucked in on...  You lucked out.  I lucked in.  You did.  You did luck in.  Listen, um, we're all having a good time here, right?  Absolutely.  Like, you're getting a good vibe.  First of all, I want to play the...  What was your vibe last...  Two weeks ago, the last time we did Couch of Zilches,  uh, they were very quiet, even on the after show.  And I walked them out, and I was like,  you guys could have talked.  Like, I would talk to them, and they would be like, uh-huh.  I'd be like, okay, well, then we're going to talk to Eric, then. 
[00:11:30]  Not you.  E-Rock.  I know, yeah.  And what had happened was, they said that they were so scared of Club Soda Kenny,  and what he had said to them in the beginning,  that even during the after show, when I was talking to them,  they didn't really want to say too much,  because they knew that he could hurt them physically.  What was your guys...  Because, what, were you guys greeted by Roland first, and then Kenny?  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So what was your immediate take of Club Soda Kenny?  Well, I've seen him at Jimmy's shows before,  so I knew what he would look like.  You knew his vibe.  Oh, yeah, absolutely. 
[00:12:00]  And I've seen people getting in line for pictures,  and it's...  Everything's very orderly.  And you know what happens when it's not.  Oh, yeah.  They're removed.  Yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah.  What about you, Brian?  Right.  He just...  He comes...  He's a big guy, obviously.  Yeah.  He's physically imposing.  But he just comes across as like...  He gets off on that vibe.  Yeah.  He likes the uncomfortableness.  Yeah.  You can see.  He gets like kind of a little corner smirk in the corner of his mouth  when he sees that kind of trembling.  He will make a mistake sometimes  because like you'll be trembling,  and you'll see the smirk in his mouth,  and you'll be like, 
[00:12:30]  oh, this is just a joke with me and him.  Yeah.  And then you'll try to joke with him,  and it'll just get worse  because you don't realize what he's getting off on  is you being in that submissive, uncomfortable state.  So the best thing you could do  is just kind of get into the fetal position and play dead.  You, Eric, young Eric.  Yes.  Well, same thing...  You tried some humor when you met Club Soda.  I've seen him at gym shows,  but when I was here for Car Crash Comedy,  I think security that day was just pretty intense anyway 
[00:13:00]  because of all the guests coming in.  All the people coming in.  So it was...  Yeah, definitely he's intimidating.  We rode up on the elevator, actually,  and it was like this awkward silence.  I wanted to say hi.  You and Kenny?  No, you wouldn't have said hi back.  Yeah, I was like...  Or you would have gotten the word hello,  and that would have been the end.  So why bother?  I didn't even bother.  I just like looked down at the floor.  Well, I wanted to share that experience  that you all had with everybody at home  because there's people at home,  one guy on the phone who...  Bobo, I see you on hold. 
[00:13:30]  Bobo has now been on hold for two hours and 30 minutes.  Bobo, I'm going to talk to you after I play this clip  because I don't think it's right what they do to you.  I don't know.  Did you guys hear the beginning of the show today?  No, I didn't.  Opie picked up the phone.  Bobo had called in trying to see if Opie would go to the Mets game.  Have you been following this Mets game saga?  Absolutely.  Okay.  So Bobo wants to take Opie to the Mets game.  He got tickets in the 500 section.  He called the after show yesterday,  which is the nosebleed of the Mets' new stadium.  He called the after show yesterday to say that he had better seats 
[00:14:00]  and that he had more tickets.  He was trying to get Opie to come,  so I said, you know, what can I do?  Just check and see if you can get on the couch at Zilches  because we'll post it on Facebook.  That's how you guys got here, right?  Yes, sir.  You saw the Facebook.  You emailed in.  Check and see if you can get on the couch at Zilches  or call the show.  He obviously is not a quick guy,  so he didn't get the email on time to get on the couch at Zilches.  And then he calls in this morning,  and Opie picked him up.  He talked to him for a minute. 
[00:14:30]  He said, leave me alone.  He hung up on him,  and he was in a bad mood for 30 minutes.  And you know how Opie and his timed bad moods are?  It was 30 minutes long.  I was in the studio,  and I just simply looked down and didn't say a word  because otherwise, whoever was talking,  I mean, Opie started,  Kevin James felt the heat.  The Soup Nazi felt the heat.  Whoever was in the path of destruction felt the heat  of Opie's bad mood brought on by Bobo.  So, Bobo, we're going to talk to you in a minute. 
[00:15:00]  What is this?  I just need Sam to say Opie Radio fans.  On Facebook, I guess, it's Opie Radio fans.  But that was on the feedback, by the way.  I do read the feedback.  This is what I wanted to play for you, though.  Club Soda Kenny welcoming our guests.  Just so everybody at home,  because people at home are sitting here saying,  I would like to be on the couch of Zilches,  or I live way across the country.  I'll never get to experience being welcomed by Club Soda Kenny.  So, this is it.  Okay, everybody have ID?  Ron, you have the release forms? 
[00:15:30]  They signed them already?  All right.  Anybody got anything on them they shouldn't have?  Is water okay?  No weapons, no contraband.  Nothing that will embarrass yourself.  Nothing that will aggravate me.  A small wiener.  That's the best.  Sorry.  That was my attempt to be funny.  Why would a small wiener aggravate me?  What are you saying?  I'm gay?  No, no.  That was before the...  What did you say before the...  How small is it?  You know.  It's too embarrassed to say, you know? 
[00:16:00]  All right.  So, when we go in the studio, all right, you can take pictures, but just be discreet about  it, all right?  Just snap a couple.  Don't snap a lot, all right?  But don't bother the talent for pictures during a break or anything like that, all right?  You can take a couple candid shots, all right?  And nobody be disruptive in there.  Just speak when you're spoken to, all right?  And...  One question, sir. 
[00:16:30]  What is it?  After the show, may we get a picture of the talent?  No.  We'll see how your decorum is.  Okay.  Yes, sir.  Absolutely.  All right.  I just want Opie to unblock me on Twitter.  You probably boxed it for a reason.  Maybe we should...  Maybe because I said I didn't think Bobo was funny.  Maybe we should just throw you out now.  All right.  Anything else, Sam? 
[00:17:00]  It's not my job.  All right.  Let's go.  See, now, Brian, you're the one who said, I just want him to unblock me.  You're lucky that Kenny, for whatever reason, was in a good mood today.  Because if Kenny had been in a bad mood, or if he had gotten yelled at, or anything had  gone wrong, he would have kicked you out just because.  Wow.  You get that vibe, right?  Yeah.  He doesn't bluff.  If you, David, did the smart thing of just keeping your mouth shut.  I was about 10 feet off mic.  Yeah.  I just kept backpedaling.  Right.  Yeah.  And, Eric, what I loved in that clip was, you're the one who made the joke about the  wiener.  And you immediately looked at his face and saw how bad of an idea... 
[00:17:30]  Exactly.  Like, it's just not the time.  You go, I'm embarrassed of my small wiener.  I'm sorry.  I should have said that.  That's exactly it.  I love that about 10 seconds into that, he took to calling him sir.  Yeah, I used to stare a lot with Kenny.  Absolutely.  People, certain people are due certain respects.  After two hours and 35 minutes, Bobo, you're on the air.  Boo.  Yeah.  Yeah, first of all, I didn't even get that email on Todd Barrett. 
[00:18:00]  What email?  No, you said that there was an email sent to me.  I didn't even get that email.  I didn't say there was an email sent to you.  We put on Facebook, all right, we're doing Couch of Zilchers tomorrow.  Email in now.  First four gets to come in.  That's the whole deal.  There's no special, like, Bobo signal that we put up to let you know.  I mean...  Big dummy symbol in the sky.  Why wouldn't I do that for, why would I do that just for Bobo and not for my friends  Brian, David, and Eric? 
[00:18:30]  Like, that wouldn't be fair to them, would it?  No, all right.  I mean, I had my name on that waiting list, but I sent an email like a week ago.  No, but Bobo, the way the Couch of Zilchers works, did you guys try two weeks ago at all?  Yes.  I did.  And you didn't get in, right?  No.  Okay, the way the Couch of Zilchers works is a Facebook message goes up on Facebook.com  slash Opie and Anthony.  It says, email this address if you want to be on the Couch of Zilchers.  The first four emails are coming in. 
[00:19:00]  That's it.  Also, I got to do it every week.  Yes, Bobo.  Yes.  Stop.  Erich, did you hear that?  I'm not even addressing it.  Every week, Bobo.  Every week that we do it.  Just assume he's coming.  Yeah, it's not just one email at the start of the bit, and then that counts for the whole  time, because then why would we post it every time?  We just use the backup emails.  Oh, and you usually post it on Thursday.  That's right. 
[00:19:30]  All right.  Oh, this is great.  So, Bobo, this whole thing was a misunderstanding.  All right, this whole thing was a misunderstanding, all right?  I sent it and thought that it was going to be over.  A week, but now I know, all right?  Brian, I don't think you sent it.  I think you're lying.  No, I'm not lying.  Okay.  Brian, you just wanted to hear that.  That was like a little dream for you, huh?  But Sam...  Yeah, Eric...  Oh, hold on.  Go ahead, Bobo.  You don't want to interrupt that. 
[00:20:00]  I thought I just said that because he wanted to hear me say that.  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah, we got that.  Okay.  I kind of cleared that up.  Um, if this was a misunderstanding, then what about the, uh, threatening text that he was  sending during vacation?  Anything on that, Bobo?  No.  No, that was...  I'm serious by accident.  And the other thing is I misread that.  Oh, yeah.  Never mind.  This is what happened.  Uh, Travis actually went through Opie's Twitter to find out what you misread.  Opie posted a thing on Twitter that says anybody who says Bobo is not funny is getting  blocked.  That's a pro-Bobo tweet. 
[00:20:30]  And you decided that he was insulting you.  Do you want, do you want to hear what he wrote?  Yes, please, Eric.  Okay.  E-Rock.  This came to me on Tuesday at 6.30.  Uh, Opie thinks he can talk about me on Twitter like in the way he did on 7-1-11.  He will hear it from me in a call in next live ONA show.  But he controls the phones, Bobo.  That's not a real threat.  Danny.  I just need to clear something up.  Okay, Bobo's on the line.  Hi, Bobo. 
[00:21:00]  Hi.  Bobo, it's your, it's your, it's your,  your buddy, Danny.  I'm here in defense of Bobo.  Okay.  Because I don't seem to understand why you guys don't understand why he gets things wrong  sometimes.  Okay.  Let me explain something.  Okay.  He's retarded.  I don't know.  Bobo, is this true?  Bobo?  No, it's not true.  All right.  Well, hang on.  Bobo would know.  I just misread something, all right?  Did you misread something or are you just retarded?  Okay.  Danny, I'm starting to sense some frustration that you have for young Bobo. 
[00:21:30]  Well, you know, but if you had to pick a percentage, Bobo, of retardation, how, how  much percent do you think you'd be?  Nice.  So that's only 10%.  10%.  That's not much.  So, so, so, but you have to, what you have to understand is that that, that message, that  tweet that went out, that got all jumbled up in the 10% retardation brain.  Well, first of all, Bobo, I would like to apologize for Danny because he should know we don't use  the R word on this show.  I'm sorry.  He's 10% mongoloid.  Okay.  That's fine.  Bobo, mongoloid, that okay? 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, but whatever, all right?  Whatever.  It's not, it's not a big deal.  Bobo, how did it make you feel to know, and I'm going to hang up on you soon because  it's a lot of Bobo, but how did it make you feel when you completely put Opie in a horrible  mood for 30 minutes this morning?  What?  Into the phone.  No, it's going to be on the left.  Wait, hold on, I'm on the phone.  You're on the radio!  Now!  Who are you talking to, Bobo?  No, my mom.  Okay.  Tell that bitch to wait a minute! 
[00:22:30]  Bobo, you can't, you were on hold for two and a half hours, and you're not prepared to  do this on the air?  Yeah, yeah, I was ready.  Now, Bobo, tell me how you felt when you found out that Opie was in a bad mood because  of you.  A little bit upset.  You don't sound it.  All right, Bobo.  Do you feel better now?  Yeah, yeah, I was, all right?  It went away after about like an hour later, all right?  Okay, so he had a half hour bad mood, you had a one hour sadness. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true.  It's like, I, I pretty much gave up on that.  I don't care.  I'll tell you what.  I don't care if Opie says he is going to the game.  I gave up.  What the fuck, dude?  What if he wants to go to the game?  That's, that's disrespectful.  If he wants to go to the game, then, then yeah, the tickets are available.  This is a, Bobo, Opie.  Wait, you want him to buy the tickets now?  Opie is a celebrity.  Like, Opie is a big star.  Like, it's not like it's like one of your boys.  Like, if Opie went to the game with you, it would be an honor. 
[00:23:30]  Like, Brian, well, Opie doesn't like you, so I'll go to Dave.  How are we made up?  I don't know.  Dave, if you found out that Opie was going to go to the Mets game with you,  it wouldn't be like a whatever situation for you, would it?  Oh, that'd be awesome.  It'd be an honor.  Absolutely.  And, Bobo, you're just sitting here like whatever?  No, I'm not.  Of course, I'm upset about it, but I'm not, I'm not.  Bobo, how would you like to come in to the studio next Friday? 
[00:24:00]  All right, that'll be good.  All right, well, then make sure you stay on Facebook,  because if we do Couch of Zilchers again,  you've got to make sure you're one of the first four emails.  All right.  I think you're taking this show for granted, Bobo.  All right, bye, Bobo.  No, you're not busy.  What's she doing?  Get her on the phone. 
[00:24:30]  He just got hung up on it.  Now he's going to think it's because of his sister.  You see what I did there?  Eric, are we running out of time, or do we have a couple minutes?  I think we're running out of time.  Well, don't think, Eric, because you're the guy who should know.  Yeah, we're running out of time.  Okay.  You got lunch today, buddy?  Nope.  What about for me and the Zilchers?  No.  Sam and the Zilchers, lunch on E-Rock.  No.  Yeah.  How does that sound to you guys?  That sounds wonderful.  That sounds pretty perfect.  What about just for Eric?  Yeah.  What do you think, E-Rock? 
[00:25:00]  For this Eric, yes.  That Eric, no.  Oh, man.  All right, well, Zilchers, I hope you enjoyed your stay here  at the lovely Opie and Anthony Studios.  Because, Danny, I hope you're happy that you got to sound off a little on Bobo,  because I know it's a frustration thing.  Yeah, sorry.  I got distracted here.  Somebody left their Twitter open.  Oh, you'd think he'd learn.  I mean, somebody keep the cop.  Yeah, because now he's going to find out, right?  Well, I mean, hopefully he's in the tunnel. 
[00:25:30]  What?  I mean, Eric, thank you for being here.  E-Rock, you're a good person, and I'm glad you got over that whole sex buzzer thing.  This has been After Opie and Anthony Live.  Stay tuned.  The Ron and Fez Show comes up next.  I don't know who Ron's co-host will be today,  but I'm sure they'll be coming in like gangbusters.  Opie and Anthony, and After Opie and Anthony Live continue on Monday.  Goodbye, everybody. </pre>
