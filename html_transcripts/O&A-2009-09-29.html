<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a discussion of a bizarre "Two for Tuesday" promotion, followed by complaints about a depressing anti-smoking commercial featuring a recently deceased man and the show's annoyance with smokers outside the studio.  They speculated about the man's estranged relationship with his daughter.  The hosts then launched into a series of crude impressions and jokes about their colleague, Bob Kelly, culminating in the airing of a recorded segment documenting Bob's disastrous fly fishing trip—a bedbug-infested room, no HBO, and unsettling interactions with other people.

The show took a dark turn with a discussion of graphic videos depicting violent gang attacks in Chicago, focusing on the brutal murder of a bystander. This segued into a discussion of a separate stabbing in New York City, highlighting the randomness of urban violence.  A lengthy debate on gun control and the Second Amendment followed, featuring numerous caller opinions on gun ownership, concealed carry, and the interpretation of the Second Amendment.  This segment concluded with more Bob Kelly jokes and a mention of upcoming guests Mike Rowe and Dana White.  Opie shared a personal anecdote about his first sexual experience before moving on to a caller's story about their first encounter with Rodney Dangerfield's stand-up comedy.  The conversation then shifted to the caller's early radio experiences.

Next, the hosts discussed the heavy security surrounding a terrorism suspect's court appearance in Brooklyn, followed by a critical review of the Broadway show "A Steady Rain," starring Hugh Jackman and Daniel Craig.  They played (with difficulty) a recording of a cell phone ringing during the performance, triggering Jackman's angry response. This transitioned into a mocking discussion of Andy Rooney's segment on his hatred of vacations, punctuated by explicit sexual descriptions and graphic humor.  Significant technical difficulties ensued with a sound clip provided by E-Rock, leading to on-air bickering and frustrated troubleshooting, including problems with a poorly-burned CD. The hosts also briefly discussed sports news, covering the Dallas Cowboys, New York Yankees, and New York Jets. The "Pat Ourselves on the Back" segment concluded this section, outlining future show plans.

The show then focused on Kraftwerk, playing "Autobahn" and "Pocket Calculator" while making sexually suggestive and vulgar comments about the band.  A discussion about musical sellouts followed, featuring calls debating whether bands like Pearl Jam, KISS, Nirvana, and Ozzy Osbourne had sold out, as well as a discussion of the offensive antics of Gigi Allen.  A caller from RottenTomatoes.com joined to discuss their list of the 100 worst movies. The segment was rife with vulgar language, descriptions of sexual acts, and references to drug use.

A listener question about Jon Voight's filmography led to a discussion of *Super Babies: Baby Geniuses 2* and the hosts' top ten worst movies of the last decade, including films starring Larry the Cable Guy, Eddie Griffin, and Tyler Perry, also criticizing De Niro and Pacino’s recent acting.  Listener calls with (often incorrect) movie trivia followed. This transitioned to a discussion of upcoming films like *Zombieland*, *Whip It*, and *The Invention of Lying*, alongside the 3D re-release of *Toy Story*. Another Rotten Tomatoes caller joined, and a vulgar discussion about *The Fifth Element* ensued. The latter part of this segment covered a tweet from Dana White praising the show, Sam's wrestling and hip-hop-heavy Twitter feed, and the upcoming appearance of Dana White in the studio to discuss UFC fighters, including Chuck Liddell's participation in *Dancing with the Stars*, Rampage Jackson, Brock Lesnar, Fedor Emelianenko, the Randy Couture versus Brandon Vera fight, and the Brock Lesnar versus Shane Carwin fight.  This segment was filled with crude and offensive language.

Finally, Dana White appeared as a guest. The conversation covered Brock Lesnar's outburst at Bud Light and reconciliation with Frank Mir, Michael Vick's NFL comeback, Kimbo Slice's UFC debut, a comparison of UFC and boxing, a hypothetical Anderson Silva versus Roy Jones Jr. fight, the rivalry between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier (including a story about Frazier's voicemail), other upcoming UFC fights (including Tito Ortiz's return and the Machida vs. Shogun fight), and ticket giveaways.  The segment included humorous moments, teasing, and frequent crude and sexually suggestive comments.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Yeah, let's do that.  But Jimmy's tortured and caught by surprise every morning with that clip.  I don't think he wants to hear it.  No, not anymore.  It's two for Tuesday.  Is it?  And good morning to y'all.  Yeah, why not?  Does that even mean?  Two for Tuesday?  Is that even mean now?  All your favorite twofers.  Great.  Hears. 
[00:00:30]  Why don't we have to see that smoky commercial every morning?  Oh, the guy with the tube?  It's like band-aided into his nose.  Is that a national commercial?  Got to be right.  Is the tip of his nose missing?  No, I think they just wrapped it up like that to hold the tube in.  Oh.  Yeah.  Until his daughter comes and sees him.  Because he had throat cancer. 
[00:01:00]  And then the doctor said, hey, you also got lung cancer.  So he's laying in the bed.  And he's got the tube up his nose.  And he says, well, my daughter's coming to see me.  And, you know, I'll be alive for that.  And then the screen kind of fades to black and the text comes up and says, nope, he didn't quite make it.  Yeah, but here's the problem.  It says in the commercial he died 10 days after this commercial was filmed. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, I know.  There's a problem there.  What the fuck?  Where was the daughter?  What, was she busy?  Where was she?  On the moon?  She's busy.  Waiting for the space shuttle to come back home?  Yeah.  You could get anywhere in 10 days.  Should have, you know, maybe hurried up.  I guess there's a little more to that story.  Maybe the daughter didn't want to see dear old Pop.  Maybe he was, you know, putting out his cigarettes on his daughter or something.  Yeah, she could have, you know, hopped the plane lickety-split.  Because the whole commercial is about how the daughter's coming to see him. 
[00:02:00]  The daughter's coming to see him.  Yeah.  10 days later, he's dead.  10 days.  10 days.  What did she have that was so important that the, uh, she couldn't go and see him?  Right.  She was disgusted by that tube taped to his fucking nose.  Why do we have to see that every morning?  Then it says, quit smoking.  Well, you know what?  I think it's better than that, uh, guy with the, uh...  No, that guy was, uh...  The throat.  He was a laugh riot, though.  I cannot swim. 
[00:02:30]  I swam when I was young, but now I cannot swim.  Swim?  Swim.  The water go in my hole and I will drown.  Oh.  Oh.  Quite disgusting.  Ah, whatever.  What the hell is smoking?  I can't do it anymore.  Jesus.  When you see someone smoking nowadays, it's weird, right?  Yeah.  I hate when we leave and got to walk through the fucking cloud.  Hmm?  When we leave in the, uh, uh, uh, uh, when we leave after the show. 
[00:03:00]  Right.  Right.  Um, and, uh, there's people outside the door, you know?  Just puffing away.  Mm.  They got to walk through that, that cloud.  Cloud of smoke?  I mean, I've become, you know...  I'll leave the smokers alone.  No, you know what?  That's the only place they can smoke now.  One little circle in the middle of Manhattan.  I say death chambers.  I say those big glass airport-like death chambers.  Love those places.  People go in and just sit there and the glass walls are dripping with yellow tar. 
[00:03:30]  Right.  Just amazing.  And they're just in there stinking.  Well, one person that smokes is, uh, Bob Kelly, Robert Kelly.  Yeah.  Enjoys his nature with, uh, with a lot of chain smoking.  Nature.  I could not stop doing Jimmy's Bob Kelly impression all night last night.  I was just going, dude, you got a cup of coffee.  Boom.  You're in.  Bing.  You're done.  You couldn't stop doing it.  I have to find the email from Anthony I got. 
[00:04:00]  It was just, this is it.  Oh, the whole, uh...  Dude!  I don't know, dude!  So what?  He comes in, drinks his coffee.  Boom!  Then what?  Yeah, it was a guest pitch.  And everybody was like, yeah, yeah.  Well, we'll take him.  We'll take him.  And I'm like, well, dude.  Dude, you know, he comes in, he's got his coffee, talks.  What do we do?  I mean, come on.  Dude!  He always does that.  He does the impression and he acts out.  He's the worst for her.  He'll come over.  And he wants me to go wireless. 
[00:04:30]  So you go, you know what, dude?  It's great.  You got your laptop.  You're wireless.  Boom!  Sit down.  You got your cup of coffee.  And he actually does the motion of opening the laptop.  Opening the laptop.  It's like, I know how to open the laptop.  Fuck.  I don't need both hands.  Boom!  Open it up.  Is that how it works, Bob?  Because I've been typing with it closed.  He's just a happy, jolly guy.  Oh, he makes me sick.  He says happy by simple things.  I really enjoyed Jimmy Norton's answer, too, to that one, which was pretty goddamn funny.  The email.  I agree with this one. 
[00:05:00]  Jimmy, he makes me laugh.  Yeah.  Everybody said yes.  Which, of course, you know, who wouldn't say yes to that gentleman?  Now, if I can only find Jimmy's email.  Oh, now I can't find it.  It was in mockery of Bob.  Of course it was.  I know that much.  Yeah.  Jesus.  It was fantastic.  There it is.  There it is.  He goes, you drop your line in. 
[00:05:30]  Boom.  Cut a cup of coffee.  It's all you need, dude.  What a blithering fatso.  You called me blithering fatso.  No, not you.  Him.  No, that's what I mean.  You called him a blithering fatso.  Oh, did that make me laugh.  I do love Bob.  Bob is such a fucking lunatic.  Bob doesn't understand that he is nuts.  Bob Kelly is crazy.  And he's like, everything he does is trying to fight.  Bob's instinct is just to knock people out. 
[00:06:00]  Bob's a crazy fuck.  And the whole thing is just to try to be a gentleman and lead a gentleman's life and a relaxed life.  A gentleman's life, yes.  He just wants so much to be a distinguished, refined gentleman.  Well, part two of the fly fishing extravagance is up there for your viewing pleasure.  And he gives my HD flip a look like he either is going to kill me, like you just said, with the crazy eyes, or he's going to attempt to fucking kiss me.  Really?  Yes. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, a lot of homoerotic comments on the latest fucking, I don't know, what the fuck.  He's got these eyes.  I've seen him give those eyes to young Samuel.  He's got these eyes.  Young Samuel.  And you're not really sure what's going on behind those eyes.  Oh, here, here.  Oh, oh, oh.  I think Bobby has finally made it to Roscoe, New York.  Come on in.  Watch these.  Bobby!  Bobby! 
[00:07:00]  What's going on?  Match the Hatch weekend.  Match the Hatch weekend.  Look at you, you got your hat on.  All right, stop walking toward me, you weirdo.  What's wrong?  What's happening?  By the way, look, no HBO.  Look at that TV.  No HBO.  You promised me HBO up here.  You got satellite dish.  I don't know how to turn on the dish.  It's the satellite dish.  You got to turn on the satellite dish.  Really?  There you go.  Now you got HBO.  And by the way, there's something in this bed.  It bit me.  You don't bring your own blanket?  No, I didn't. 
[00:07:30]  You don't bring your own blanket?  He's horrified.  No, I didn't.  What's wrong with you?  I don't know.  Isn't this a great room?  That's fantastic.  I just followed the guy for 20 minutes.  The paneling?  Right.  Albert Keller took my room.  What are the odds?  I don't know.  He gave them the king.  He gave me a double bed.  I was like, I'm not staying in a double bed with my wife.  I'm not Dick Van Dyke.  And he went over there and kicked him out.  Did you smell the alcohol in his breath?  I smelled the alcohol and the curry.  And the curry?  And the guy doesn't speak any English. 
[00:08:00]  That's bad.  Look, I got a river view.  Yeah.  Well, it's dark now because, you know, you're supposed to be up here.  Whatever.  It goes on forever.  It's fun, though.  It's actually cool.  The look he gives is a little later on where he's just kind of creepily looking at me as  he's trying to explain fly fishing.  I'm like, I think he might either attempt to kiss me or fucking kill me.  I don't know.  What is this?  At a restaurant?  Yeah.  It's actually right past this.  Nazzy.  If you want on this.  Oh, what a shithole.  Oh, yeah.  Look, I love. 
[00:08:30]  What's his shirt say?  Some fat broad in the restaurant had a shirt that said, I love my badass attitude.  Here it is.  Look at this fucking look.  Yeah.  We might.  If it does rain.  Yeah.  We're going to go.  No, we're not.  We're just not the fight.  If it's raining tomorrow morning, I'm going to go antiquing.  Big boy shatter mouth.  I'm heading back to New York City.  That's the boy shatter.  It's raining.  That's when you go out there because no one else is going to go.  We're going to be the only anglers on the river.  Yeah.  Good for you.  Dude, I got a rain jacket. 
[00:09:00]  Didn't you bring a poncho?  No, I didn't bring a poncho.  You can buy a poncho at the store.  I'm not getting a poncho.  I'm going to be in water.  What's the difference between water on your head coming from the sky or water coming from  your feet?  This could be a big problem if it's raining tomorrow.  You hear the rain, right?  What a shithole.  I know.  It's just the worst.  That's a terrible trick.  No, we're not.  We're going to match the hatch.  Don't be surprised if you knock on this door tomorrow morning and I'm long gone.  Just the doors open and the bed's running. 
[00:09:30]  Dude, if I wake up and you're not here tomorrow, I will fucking be hurt, but I will laugh for  around 45 minutes.  If I just see tire marks, just a dry spot where your fucking car was.  Nice.  Like you just left, dude.  Yeah.  All right.  He'll be here.  Well, go to bed.  Get some sleep.  And then he comes back.  Bobby's knocking at my door.  I said goodnight to the guy and he comes back.  Did I say goodnight to you already?  Listen to me.  Yeah, I'm listening.  Do you want to know what matching the hatch is?  What?  That's when you find a bug in the area that you're in. 
[00:10:00]  Right.  And then you try to match that with the flies you have.  Sure.  Yeah.  Like this one I found on my fucking pillow.  Wait, let's put it under the light.  Look at this monster.  What the fuck?  Put it on my bed.  Look at this big bug.  It's still hot, by the way.  I found it on my pillow.  So, what are we doing?  We have to find a fly that looks like this.  Yeah.  Fucking creature.  Okay. 
[00:10:30]  And then we fish with this.  He's a psycho.  This is matching the hatch.  I'm going to fucking puke.  You're a psycho.  This is on my pillow.  You're a psycho.  This hotel is creepy, dude.  This is on my pillow.  You should see the film The Bug and His Friend Made.  I hope the serial killer.  The giant bald monster.  Before he hits mine.  Yeah.  You want it?  What?  I'm supposed to get scared because you're going to throw a little mosquito at me?  It's not a mosquito.  Go to bed, dude.  Go to bed.  Go to bed, dude.  Hey, don't be locked. 
[00:11:00]  Dude.  He was just so excited.  Dude.  Why is it called Match the Hatch?  Like, what's the hatch?  I don't know.  I guess they all hatch.  Like, I understand.  Hatch is.  Hatch, I guess, is the bug that's on.  Yeah.  What is that?  I have a surface of a river.  It rhymes.  That's all it is.  Yeah.  I guess they just want to rhyme it up.  Match the bugs.  Yeah.  It's more accurate.  They don't really fit, though.  No.  But anyway.  My God.  My God, man.  I was just watching a great little melee. 
[00:11:30]  What happened?  Apparently in, where is that, Chicago?  Is that where that honor student was beaten with that board?  Well, yeah.  Honor student.  They said he was an honor student.  Well, yeah, this is blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Two rival gangs, I guess, got into a fight three blocks from the high school, and all four  students were beaten in the melee.  One was released from the hospital.  One police to investigate.  Apparently, Darian Albert, 16, was struck in the head by one of the boards. 
[00:12:00]  And then if you watch it, his head is stomped.  He's kicked in the face.  I swear to you, it just looks like a wild gang of savages.  This looks like the streets of Somalia.  It really doesn't look like another country.  It does not look like the United States.  It is a brutal attack by young African Americans in just a savage way. 
[00:12:30]  It says that the two gangs, there had been some kind of a shooting earlier, and this  kid was not a part of either gang.  He was just kind of watching on the corner, and he got caught up in it.  And it's like, no one is filming him.  They're just kind of filming the whole thing happening.  Yeah.  And you see some fucking kid wail on him with a board, and then he falls.  And then other people just start stomping his face.  When he tries to get up, you can see these other fucking animals just jump on him, and  they stomp him to death, and he's dead.  He's dead.  Yes.  I swear to you, it just doesn't look like the United States of America. 
[00:13:00]  And this is what goes on.  Listen to the sounds, everything.  It's just savagery.  They're picking up giant boards and just swinging them, beating people over the head.  That was disturbing.  Well, look at that.  Well, what the fuck?  Constantly ganging up on people, getting the extra kick in for no reason, even though 
[00:13:30]  you didn't have to take them down.  You'll see him.  He appears when he sits up on the sidewalk.  I don't even know if they've showed him yet.  I can't tell what's going on here.  Someone got cracked right in the head.  I think he's on the ground there now.  Yeah, he's trying to sit up.  You see him in the black shirt?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's the kid that died.  They just jump on his head.  Yeah, they start jumping on his head.  They blur it out because it's just too brutal.  Look at these guys.  Three of them.  No. 
[00:14:00]  They crack that guy's head right open.  What up, son?  What up, son?  What up?  His head is exploded.  He had nothing to do with it.  Yeah, great.  Great place, that inner city of Chicago. 
[00:14:30]  That's a wonderful, wonderful area.  Ugh.  Stop already.  Would you stop?  Well, Reverend Allen was on, you know, the WWE last night.  Yeah.  He had important things to do last night.  Oh, there won't be a comment on this because it's black on black.  No, I'm just saying, instead of maybe, you know.  It's black on black.  So he's not going to get involved.  No, I'm just saying, yeah, instead of going into the inner cities and trying to figure out  what the fuck is going on in these places.  I guess a Hispanic kid was knifed in the city, New York City, yesterday. 
[00:15:00]  Well, they said that he was a guy.  He was from the Bronx.  Apparently, these two guys just bump into it.  This is how, like, you never know who you're talking shit to.  Exactly.  It's like, there's times I've been on the train and somebody looks at you wrong.  And as a man, you want to just go, what the fuck?  Like, just so you don't feel like a pussy later.  Yep.  But it's like, this is what happens.  Like, these two guys are walking.  They bump into each other, apparently.  And I guess words were exchanged.  They got into a heated argument.  So one guy just pulls out a knife and stabs the guy in the chest.  Three times.  And he's dead.  Just stabs him in the chest.  He's on the Midtown Post Office steps. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, I know.  And some German tourist.  Right near Madison Square Garden.  Oh, that is right.  That is, right?  Oh, my God.  It's a block away.  Tops.  You couldn't be in a more public place than that.  You could not be in a more public place.  Stabbed him three times and then just walked away.  And then came back because he obviously dropped his cell phone.  Yeah, oops.  And then some German tourist snapped a perfect photo of the guy, profile, walking away.  Just two photos of him.  I'm telling you, this guy right now has no idea his picture was taken until today.  He might not even still know if he's in bed or if he doesn't read the post.  Well, he's probably. 
[00:16:00]  He has no idea his photo is in the post right now.  I don't think, put it this way, I don't think he's going to read the paper at work and find out that he's in Dutch.  Yeah, it is a little early.  Yeah.  6.30.  So, yeah, there's a guy right now on the cover of the New York Post who had been photographed by this German tourist.  Walking away after he stabbed a guy to death who probably does not even know that his picture is on the front page of one of the biggest papers in New York.  Do you think the German tourist had to delete all of his shit and chicken fucking pictures before he handed it over to the cops?  Of course he did. 
[00:16:30]  That's probably why he took the picture.  He probably thought the man was going back to drop a log on the man laying there.  Jesus Christ.  Unbelievable.  It's just, it's savagery that is just, there's a complete lack of understanding, at least on my part of it.  I can't understand a complete lack of consequence of just human life and the respect for another human's life where you'll just beat someone over the head and then start stomping their face until their head splits open and they're dead. 
[00:17:00]  Or you bump into somebody and you trade some words and then just pull a knife out and stab him in the chest three times.  A 20-year-old kid, 20 years old, and there he goes, boom, dead.  And his family said that he argued a lot, like he got into fights, so he was probably a hothead. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, he should have kept his mouth shut, obviously, but he didn't deserve the consequences for a little, you know, a verbal argument on the steps of the post office.  But you never, you never fucking, I was on the train not long ago going home, maybe a month ago, and I had my sunglasses on.  And I'm sitting in the chair and I'm kind of looking kind of out the window across, you know, you're facing other people.  So I'm looking at the door window across from me and there's a black guy standing up. 
[00:18:00]  He's a pretty big dude and he was standing in my sight line but facing out.  But I guess he saw me in the reflection and he probably just thought I was like staring straight up at him.  With sunglasses, it's hard to tell.  So he turned around and looked down at me and he pulled his sunglasses down and looked at me like, why are you staring at me?  And I almost pulled off my glasses and looked at him like, I'm not looking at you.  But then I'm like, what the fuck are you doing?  I mean, you're not a tough guy.  You're a fucking comedian going home from a radio show, asshole.  And I'm so glad I didn't because it was like nothing. 
[00:18:30]  I looked up at him.  He obviously saw when I turned my head that I hadn't been, you know, and then he realized, oh, this guy's not trying to stare me down.  Yeah.  But it was like one of those things that it's avoidable by just not being a fucking dummy.  But like what would happen?  I've thought of that many times.  If I had just making that one move which said, yeah, I am staring at you, which I hadn't been.  A big fist in your face perhaps.  But how would life be different right now if I had to be retarded?  Like when I have teeth?  Yeah.  When I fucking have gotten my teeth knocked out or when I've gotten a fucking a stab or when nothing happened or nothing happened. 
[00:19:00]  Right.  Like where would that have gone?  But it would have been such a stupid, unnecessary thing because I actually wasn't.  And I knew exactly why he thought I was.  I knew in the reflection what it looked like.  Of course, I'll bring up what everybody expects me to bring up.  Would you feel safer?  Now, not without you and your foibles and everything of why you don't trust yourself with a gun.  But would you feel safer in certain circumstances in this city knowing that you did have a gun on you? 
[00:19:30]  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  That's all.  Of course.  I mean, again, I think most – I don't think anybody can deny they would feel safer personally without a gun.  Of course.  I mean, most people – even people who don't like guns are lying if they say they wouldn't feel safer either with a gun or with a friend who had a gun and was good at it.  Right, right.  Yeah, of course, man.  But what I – you see, the thing is – the weird thing is in a close combat like that, I trust a cop in a situation like that.  But would I – I would be – I'm – I don't like – I'm not going to fight a guy of the size this guy was. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  What am I going to do?  I would have to pull it out immediately.  Because if he hit me once, my fucking gun is now laying at my side under the subway seat because I've been struck unconscious by a larger, stronger man who probably did time for fucking – for things not like tax evasion but violent crimes.  Well, the smart thing to do is exactly what you did, which is, you know, nothing.  That's only – that's the absolute last resort.  But if there was this aggression, you know through some type of training and being proficient and educated about your weapon, you know how to handle that kind of situation where you would have perhaps backed off a little bit, waited to see what happens, give yourself enough room and see if this attack is still coming at you. 
[00:20:30]  Then you have the time, distance to thwart it with superior firepower.  Would I be – see, I'd want to – my problem is I'd want to save my own life. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  I'm not saying – I would love to have a gun.  But again, I don't want to sort of trust my judgment in the sense that if a guy like that was coming – like Kenny, me and Kenny one time, just to sidetrack, we're coming out of a fucking store late one night and I walked out of a revolving door.  And I think Kenny had looked at this really big, psychotic guy walk in just to make sure I came out all right.  But I think I told you the story.  I walked out and the guy apparently came out, like circled behind me and came right back out and was staring.  And he was like, do you want something? 
[00:21:30]  Oh, man.  And I turned around.  I couldn't believe he was speaking because I didn't even acknowledge the guy.  Right.  And I'm like, what?  And he goes, yeah, what?  Do you want something?  And he was addressing me and Kenny.  And he was obviously very drunk and very fucking crazy.  I had just done a show.  I thought the guy was a fan fucking around.  It was such a non-confrontational mood.  Were you staring at him or anything?  Not even a little.  Kenny had looked at him when he had walked out just to make sure I was.  Right, right.  But this guy was big.  And I was like, what are you – I didn't know what was happening. 
[00:22:00]  He was like so surprised.  I didn't even look at the guy.  So we just got in the truck and the guy was like, yeah, get in the fucking truck and leave.  And Kenny was just staring at the guy.  I mean, Kenny didn't back off.  Yeah, yeah.  But I didn't understand why didn't Kenny just pull out his gun and point it at this fucking animal.  I'm like, point it at him.  But Kenny's like, no.  I'm like, if this guy had come over, what would you have done?  He goes, well, I would have taken him because Kenny can fight hand to hand.  Yeah, Kenny can do that.  But the idea of pulling his gun out was not his first or second thought.  It shouldn't be. 
[00:22:30]  It would have been mine immediately.  I would have just shot him out of fear.  Avoidance is the number one thing.  Avoid the situation.  Running is a great option.  If somebody has a gun, then those options kind of go away.  And you're whittling down your options to, hey, so do I, kind of a thing.  But yeah, the thing you're supposed to do is avoid the confrontation.  But, you know, there are certain circumstances, you read about them all the time in the paper and see them on the news, where it's unavoidable. 
[00:23:00]  Someone kicks in your door of your house.  You all of a sudden notice you're not quite in a public area and you're being followed by some people.  These are threatening situations where I know you'd be standing there going, god damn, I need a weapon.  Are you looking around on the ground for a rock, you know, like a caveman?  Or do you want something more civilized that you're not really allowed to have as a law-abiding citizen in New York City? 
[00:23:30]  It's just astounding.  I don't know.  I really do think that training is a big part of it.  I agree.  You don't just dole them out to people.  Training is very important.  And knowing all the laws, very important.  But just to completely castrate a city, Chicago's another one.  I mean, you know, look at what some people have to contend with.  Yet you aren't even allowed in Chicago.  It's not even an option.  And nobody in that video, to be honest with you, because a lot of them were teenagers, 16 years old, none of them are going to qualify to own a gun. 
[00:24:00]  And I guarantee you that a lot of them probably had guns because it was an retaliation to a gang shooting.  Yeah, yeah.  So the only people that can't have guns are, like, people that are actually going to register and be responsible and defend their homes.  Yep, yeah.  It really is fucking weird.  And the more laws they make are against the legal people.  So it's not helping the problem.  It's not getting guns off the street.  They love saying that.  We've got to get guns off the street by legislating against these legal people that have been fingerprinted 800 times. 
[00:24:30]  I've had 80 pictures taken of me.  I've had to fill out forms that go back to when I was an infant.  Just get an illegal one.  Oh, yeah, sure.  Just get one of those.  Yeah, I'll be like fucking Plexico and spend a couple of years in fucking prison.  Fuck that.  I go the legal route and then get mad when they try to take my rights away.  So why doesn't the politicians go into these neighborhoods and start collecting guns?  Too hard, too hard. 
[00:25:00]  Why don't they go into the inner cities and then start knocking on doors and collect the illegal guns?  That would be a lot tougher to do, right?  Right.  It's too hard.  They do the cash for gun thing every so often.  And a church will be like, you know, bring in a gun, no questions asked, and we'll give you a hundred bucks or something like that.  Most politicians are lame-os.  Yeah.  Lame-os.  It's so much easier if you're a Carolyn McCarthy or a Bloomberg or Obama to just keep legislating against the legal gun owners that are doing everything right, exercising their Second Amendment right, and just leave everyone else alone. 
[00:25:30]  Hey, this will help get the guns off the street.  Will it?  No, it won't.  There's my soapbox for the day.  But it is frustrating, though, when you're watching these violent videos.  Thank you.  Yeah, yeah.  There's so many of them.  It's almost like if you want to get the guns off the street, stop fucking crying every time the cops fucking rough up somebody who's obviously a fucking problem. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rough up.  How old am I?  Jesus, Uncle Jim.  I love watching, you know, you watch a show like Cops or certain videos on YouTube or whatever, and there's two schools of thought from the same people.  It's why do the police have to come here and harass us, and where are the police when we need them when the shootings are happening? 
[00:26:30]  There's never a cop around.  So what is it?  Are they there, like, punching in your innocent faces, or are they not there when you need them because all of a sudden now you need them?  Because maybe you're on the wrong end of one of those illegal firearms.  Let's talk to a cop, Joe, in New York.  Hey, Joe.  What's up, guys?  How are you?  Hi, Joe.  What up, Joe?  Hey, Joe.  So listen, there was a time we used to be able to just stop these guys randomly and take guns off the street.  It was a unit called street crime. 
[00:27:00]  Too many guys got beat up.  But there was a lot of, there was the most guns ever taken over the street within this stretch of a couple of years that we had this team, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  And that was back when, what, Giuliani was?  Yeah, there was some Giuliani times, but there were so many lawsuits.  And don't get me wrong, there's some cops out there who were a little heavy-handed.  But also some of these guys might need it, you know?  Yeah, you know, a little tune-up.  A little tune-up here and there.  Those days are long gone. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, the good old days.  It was a harassment thing.  Anytime you stop somebody and you know they're up to no good, they know they're up to no good.  Yeah.  Why are you harassing me?  And it's the same thing five minutes later.  Where were you?  I just got jumped.  I just got robbed.  This, that, the other thing.  So I don't know.  We can't win.  Where were you?  Where were you?  Oh, my God.  There was a shooting.  You were nowhere to be found.  Oh, why are you always in the neighborhood?  Why are you always harassing us?  I mean, come on.  Could you make up your mind?  Oh, and it's like we want to try to clean the streets up, but nobody's got our back. 
[00:28:00]  We're kind of on our own.  Yeah.  No shit.  You guys got a, you guys got one crappy-ass job, man.  All right.  A lot of days it sucks.  A lot of days it sucks.  It's good days, you know?  Don't get me wrong.  And we have a job, so.  There you go.  All right, Joe.  All right, guys.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Scott in Iowa.  Scott.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, Obama's going to try to get the Olympics in Chicago, so I guess he's going to do street  beating as a new event.  Well, that's what it is.  It says Olympic Spirit Video Shows Brutal Gang Murder in Chicago. 
[00:28:30]  I guess there's, yeah, there's a problem with, you know, trying to get the Olympics in Chicago.  Well, he's using his world popularity to try to get the Olympics to Chicago.  Yeah, yeah.  It's kind of metal.  For what, 2016?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm pushing out.  I messed up.  Thank you.  Why would they want, why would fucking the Olympics want to go to Chicago?  I mean, not that, believe me, they can show you some videos of Rio, too.  I mean, Rio's are competing as well.  What else?  Japan? 
[00:29:00]  Well, no matter, whatever city they pick for the Olympics, there's going to be a horrendous  area.  I bet you Japan, even though there's probably crime there, and, you know, the Japanese,  I think, Yakuza they're called, I guarantee they don't have street crime like that bad.  They'll push him out of the area that the Olympics are going to be in.  And there'll be some, like, fucking, oh, why are we being pushed out of this?  Why?  Oh, it's racism.  We can't come into this area.  Well, you know, because you're acting like brutal savages, perhaps.  That's the reason.  And Chicago, by the way, is one of those cities where you can't get a gun. 
[00:29:30]  You're not allowed any fucking citizen, unless you are a police officer, you can't have a gun.  And the gun violence in Chicago is just outstanding.  So does that kind of prove right there that that type of gun control does not fucking work?  But what about the Second Amendment?  What do you mean?  We're supposed to...  Yeah, it's a right.  Bear arms.  It's a right.  No.  It's a right.  And you can't use your state-to-state license in other states. 
[00:30:00]  Right.  Could you imagine if they told you, you drive in your car, and you cross over into, like, Ohio, and you get pulled over, and the cop goes, license, registration, and you hand him your New York license, and he goes, this is New York.  You go, no, but it's a driver's license.  It's good here, right?  Nope.  It's not good.  It's only good in New York.  You'd be like, what the fuck?  Wouldn't you...  Wouldn't people freak out if they made a law that said your driver's license was only legal in your state and maybe another state, and it's all different? 
[00:30:30]  For every state?  How great would that be?  You just gotta collect licenses.  And that, by the way, is a privilege, driving.  It's a privilege.  It's not a right.  Were you up late reading a lot of stuff?  No, this is stuff I've known.  You look and sound very irritable this morning.  I was irritable because I kept getting just...  What happened last night?  What happened?  Chapped on the river card every fucking hand I played online poker last night.  I know it was something.  Oh, was I annoyed.  You came in here a bit annoyed. 
[00:31:00]  He's a bit ornery.  He is, right?  A bit ornery.  It's a little different today.  Just horrible.  A little different.  Just horrid.  You lost some bucks?  That's my last post.  Fuck this goddamn Parker Starr's cunt shit.  Fuck good cunting night.  Well, that's a wonderful tweet there.  Yeah, yeah.  That was my...  I'm so goddamn pissed off.  What time was that at?  What time was that?  One something?  Jesus.  It was seven hours ago.  It was seven hours ago.  Oh, so that's right around midnight.  Yeah.  Right before midnight, I guess. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, sure.  I went to bed at that point.  So that's why you're irritable today.  I was a little irritable at that.  But no, these things get me going.  I get slowly revved up.  Yeah, but I avoid all that stuff.  Well, this involves me, though.  Just like the inner cities.  I avoid.  I avoid the inner cities, and I avoid these videos and these websites.  I don't live in the inner city.  I don't live in the inner city.  Are you crazy?  There's Upper West Side crimes all the time.  Upper West Side gang?  Not gangs, but there's...  A bunch of old Jewish guys getting together.  There's crimes that go on up there. 
[00:32:00]  And causing havoc?  You live in an area where there could be a criminal element.  It could be wherever you live.  Comes down south.  And you, you know...  Well, that's what I'm saying.  It could be wherever you live.  And you don't have the right to protect yourself.  Yeah, but I...  Like you should be able to, because it's in the Constitution.  But, but, you know, you have, you have, you have the privilege to drive state to state  with your car.  You don't have the right to, um, uh, uh, protect yourself.  First of all, I can protect myself.  I got a hell of a backhand.  You ever see my backhand?  I can do some damage. 
[00:32:30]  Back of my hand to you, sir.  That's right.  Jimmy, you've, you've taken one of my backhands, right?  I remember one time...  Oh.  You said something.  I hope he said something.  And I was like, I don't know if that's...  And before I got the word true out,  the back of the hand came across my mouth.  It was impressive, right?  It was, you were right to do it.  And it helped me.  Because I learned that, like, you, I could think and then somehow bring it up to you later,  but never to correct you while you're speaking in front of others.  Speaking of Jimmy, I had a dream last night that he actually...  Wake up with Sticky. 
[00:33:00]  He actually, uh, uh, had a strap on.  Oh, sexy.  Did we actually...  No, what I'm trying to say is, did we actually discuss this yesterday or was that a dream  is what I should have said.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Both.  All day yesterday, I'm like, was that a dream or did Jimmy discuss for an hour his girl  trying to fuck him with us?  You should see the emails I got.  You know what, dude?  It helped me get it in my ass.  It's like these fucking construction workers are all telling me how to put a fake penis 
[00:33:30]  in my hiney.  Yeah.  Thank you, guys.  Thanks.  That's what I was telling my girl.  Thanks for that.  And then the phone's lit with everyone giving Jimmy advice on how to take it in the hiney.  Yeah, they're really nice people.  The hiney hole.  What the fuck?  Can I talk to line eight?  Because I want to see what he means.  No, you can't.  Because I like when people say I'm wrong because it's either no or not or I learned something  new.  So I really want to know what he's even talking about.  Let's go to Rob in Jersey.  Rob.  Rob, what's up, sir?  What's up?  How are you?  Hey.  Um, I'm a proud gun owner. 
[00:34:00]  I have a, uh, an FNP 45 pistol.  I have a 12, a Mossberg, a 512-gauge shotgun.  Mm-hmm.  But I understand not allowing reciprocity for concealed carry between states.  Why?  Because a state has a right to determine whether or not they shall issue or may issue a concealed  carry license.  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why does a state have that when, when, uh, uh, the Constitution of the United States  of America? 
[00:34:30]  What, what, what, why?  Well, I guess, I mean, how do you trump, you know, years of legislation and allow a state  like Utah?  Exactly.  Years of legislation has bastardized.  Everyone in Utah can get a concealed carry.  But in New Jersey, the communist state where I live, nobody can get a concealed carry.  Yeah.  Pain in the ass.  Yeah.  I mean, don't get me wrong, I believe any citizen should be able to buy any weapon that  they want, a bazooka, 50 caliber machine gun, whatever it takes, as long as you're legal  and law abiding.  But, I don't know, on a level I kind of get, you know, from a, from a politician's standpoint 
[00:35:00]  how you can't pass legislation that just says, fuck you to every state.  I don't like that because, uh, it's, it's, it's, um, it is in contradiction to the Constitution  of the United States of America.  It is in direct contradiction to the Second Amendment.  And, uh, states legislating this and keeping you from being able to protect yourself from  state to state is, uh, it's an abomination to, uh, the, the, the freedoms that we have. 
[00:35:30]  Um, so then do you also believe that, you know, the, the laws around, you know, uh, capacity  limits and lack of, um, you know, certain, certain variations you can have on like assault  weapons, although it should be repealed at the federal level.  No, I love assault weapons.  They look great.  They're fun to shoot.  And, uh, what they amount to pretty much is just a deer rifle that looks cool.  Um, uh, high capacity mags.  Eh, you know, I like them.  They're fun.  I could live without them though. 
[00:36:00]  Um, uh, as far as, uh, semi-automatic handguns go, I mean, how many are you going to fit in  that fucking thing?  Nine, 16, what are you, so who cares?  Again, you're talking about law-abiding citizens, talking about law-abiding citizens that go through  all the bullshit you got to go through.  Why then are you fucking stopped from, uh, exercising your Second Amendment right from state  to state?  It doesn't make sense to me.  Uh, just while I have you guys on, Jimmy, I love you on Jay Leno. 
[00:36:30]  You're a fantastic guy.  Jimmy is hysterically funny.  Oh, thank you, buddy.  I appreciate it.  Jimmy's going to be on Leno on Friday.  Let's not forget.  Yes.  Let's all take a peek at Leno on Friday, especially.  I'll definitely tune in.  I'll DVR it.  And, uh, oh, I love your Twitter stuff.  I love your videos.  They're excellent.  It's fine if someone's using Twitter the right way, I think.  Oh, thank you, Rob.  I appreciate it.  I'm having fun with it, actually.  Watch out, guys.  All right, brother.  Uh, let's go to, uh, J.R.  in Connecticut.  J.R.  J.R.  Thank you.  All right, uh, Anthony, if you read the rest of the Constitution down towards the end, 
[00:37:00]  uh, it explains very specifically that, uh, states are given the right to enforce the  Constitution, not the federal government.  Oh, are you talking about the, um, let me see, the 10th.  The powers, uh, not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by  it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.  The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution are reserved to the states 
[00:37:30]  respectively.  Okay, see, it says the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution.  You have to remember, when the Constitution was written, how many states were there?  Who gives a shit?  I'm explaining to you something very simply.  I mean, I believe it's wrong.  I mean, I can't own a gun.  I'm a fucking felon, so.  I'm a fucking felon.  I'm a fucking felon. 
[00:38:00]  Fucking lie to the day.  J.R., why are you a felon?  I need to know before we move on.  Do you really need to know?  Yeah.  Got to know now.  Well, when I was in high school, I got convicted of strong-arm robbery, and then the kid that  knocked on me, I blew up his car.  So I went to the claim.  And you listened to us.  How long did you go away for?  77 days.  For blowing up a car?  That's not a bad deal.  No, it wasn't too bad.  No, it was in it, I suppose.  Yeah, obviously. 
[00:38:30]  No, it was empty.  All right, back to Anthony.  Sorry.  As I read the Tenth Amendment here, sir, what I see is that anything that isn't in the  Constitution can be delegated by the states.  It includes all the things.  It says, but...  I'm sure a lawyer will call in and explain it in better detail, because I am no lawyer.  But it says the power's not delegated to the United States by the Constitution.  So that says, if it's not in the Constitution, if it doesn't infringe upon the Constitution, 
[00:39:00]  then the states can make their own laws, respectively.  Now, it is in the Constitution that our right to bear arms shall not be infringed upon.  So how does that get bastardized, twisted by some fuckers to say that the state can then  fuck with the Constitution?  When it says right there, they're using the Tenth Amendment as a way to say that the states 
[00:39:30]  can do that.  I'm looking at it saying that they can't.  But the Constitution is becoming more and more of a joke as the years go by.  It's become this easily worded thing that you can read and understand to this bastardized  piece of shit that lawyers have fucked with over the years.  It's got to be said, Spectro, Michigan, did Ant just whip out his own personal copy of  the Constitution?  I certainly did, sir.  I have it on my iPhone app.  And the guys that wrote the Constitution, if they were able to just kind of live a very, 
[00:40:00]  very long life, I'm talking about 200 years each, do you think that they would still  want us to look at the Constitution word by word?  Or you think those guys would have thought, you know what, we really got to adjust this  for the times?  Yeah, I think...  What would their thought on the Constitution be?  Seriously, if they lived...  Well, I think it is kind of a, you know, kind of a liquid document that can be changed  depending on things.  But there are certain rights that they put in there that I think are very timeless. 
[00:40:30]  You know, freedom of speech.  That's a biggie.  Number two is guns.  Number two is right after talking, for fuck's sake.  That's right.  Number two is shooting those that say things we don't like.  Right.  Exactly.  Thank you, Jim.  In case somebody's using that First Amendment to get lippy, fucking take care of them on  number two.  Don't get lippy.  I like this also, where people say, well, that was made during the time of muskets and 
[00:41:00]  whatnot.  No, no, no.  Let me just make this point, because I hear this a lot.  That was made during the time of muskets, and that's what they meant.  They didn't mean these guns we have today.  Well, let me tell you something.  No, there's more to it than that.  The British were coming, too.  You owned a farm, and you weren't sure if the British were going to be knocking on your  door.  It was a very different time.  It wasn't about the British.  It was about protecting yourself from your own government.  That's why it was put in it.  Well, I understand that's what they say.  But let's see you try to walk around with a loaded musket today, or a loaded pistol today, 
[00:41:30]  just tucked in your waistband, because everyone said, hey, that's what they meant.  So let me even take that literally and say, if that's what they meant, let me walk around  with a musket and see how long before my face is in the pavement with a knee on my neck  and my hands are behind my back.  I want to thank you.  You just gave me the idea for my next video.  We're going to be walking around the streets of Manhattan with a musket and an old school  like fucking raccoon hat thing.  Like Danl Boone. 
[00:42:00]  I'm going to walk around like that.  It's my right, sir.  I don't think they saw it coming when they arrived.  There is a point to say back then it was musket.  It's almost like back when there's a balance.  Everybody's so fucking out of balance.  It's like back then, a gun was a deadly weapon, but you couldn't take out 20 people  immediately.  I don't think they saw this coming.  There's certain things that when the Constitution was written, they saw the fact that things  would change, but they didn't see specifically guns that were going to do what they do or  the threat of airline travel or all these weird things. 
[00:42:30]  You could just take a gun and start firing in a plane.  All these weird things that they didn't see coming that are possible dangers.  That person should be taken care of.  And scolded.  They took away the person's right to own a full automatic machine gun back in the 30s.  I don't think anyone's really arguing over that either.  I mean, if you have a certain type of firearms license, you can own fully automatic guns.  You could go to places and fire them. 
[00:43:00]  You can't own them personally or tote them around.  But, you know, that's one of those laws that are like, all right, I understand this is  a weapon that you probably wouldn't use for hunting, home defense, things like that.  I don't even like using that because that's the one that the gun control people like using.  They would like you to just have maybe, maybe, if we fought as hard as we could, gun advocates,  we would probably end up with like a revolver. 
[00:43:30]  And that's it.  Well, that's not going to happen.  Yeah, well, yeah, we'll see.  We'll see.  It is insane that you can't carry your gun across state lines.  That's just ridiculous.  It doesn't make sense.  Let me say hi to Dan in Connecticut.  He's an expert on the Constitution.  Dan?  Dan, the expert on the Constitution.  How are you?  What's up?  Thomas Jefferson said that on any question with the intent of the Constitution to go back  to the time in which it was framed and look at the reason why it was. 
[00:44:00]  So there really is no liquid or living Constitution.  That's why we have amendments so that any politician can't interpret it to however it best suits their  power.  That's all they've done.  Are you talking about the mindset of the authors?  I think they use that in Brown versus the Board of Education.  Separate but equal.  They were saying that it was not intended to have one group get shittier treatment than  another group.  When they said separate but equal, they meant separate but equal.  Oh.  Well.  Wait, now we're...  I don't know.  I just know that Thomas Jefferson stated that if anyone has a question about it... 
[00:44:30]  Wait a minute.  This guy's an expert on the Constitution, but he's repeating the same thing like Rayman  about being a great driver.  I get...  No, but what Jefferson was saying...  All right.  I might have put the pressure on the guy.  I gave him that title.  You may not believe it was F. Lee Bailey.  He's just a guy who read something.  I gave him the title of expert on the Constitution.  Maybe that was my fault.  Expert around.  All right.  Thank you, expert.  He just reads like we do.  I love how we all just read something and think we're really smart and then we have  to pass it on to our friends. 
[00:45:00]  And then it's the Robert Kelly thing.  And then the person goes, well, what do you mean by that?  You know what, dude?  They didn't write that so we could all have guns, dude.  Why'd they write it?  Back of my eyes.  Back of my eyes.  Boom.  Got your gun.  You relax.  Got your coffee.  Shut up.  You got your coffee.  What are you talking about?  My favorite part of the podcast is you got your coffee.  Because it's your regular man thing.  But he just, he needs to make, to paint the picture.  And it's like, I don't give a fuck if you're holding a caffeinated beverage when your laptop 
[00:45:30]  is wireless.  It doesn't help the story.  You boob.  I want to bite Bob's fingers.  He's just an innocent boy.  He is.  Inside, he's just an innocent boy.  Half his fucking young face.  I can't stop looking at half of Bob's young face.  You know, girls, I said, are you allowed to have one?  Okay.  You're still wrong about the guns.  Let's go to Josh in Atlanta.  Josh.  Good morning.  Hi, Josh.  Hi, Josh.  Hi, Josh.  Hey, Anthony.  Yes, sir.  It's all about venue. 
[00:46:00]  The government does not have to provide a venue for those rights, like a screen fire  and a crater or something like that.  It's the same thing with guns, with any of those rights, actually.  So, just because you have the right to bear arms does not mean you have the right to walk  around with them, or conceal them, or cross their lines, or, you know, do something like  that.  That, my friend, is debatable, and it's been debated. 
[00:46:30]  It has, and that's the crux is...  Do you know what bearing an arm is?  It's not storing an arm.  It's the right to bear an arm.  It's not the right to store an arm in a locked fucking box separate from the ammunition.  You don't need to cuss at me.  Oh.  That's a good point, sir.  Oh, shit.  Sorry, sir.  Anthony's using his First Amendment right to be a complete potty mouth.  No, I understand it's not that, I mean, I'm not saying, hey, you can go out and buy 
[00:47:00]  all the guns in the world, and then, you know, you just have to store them in your complex  in Montana, but, you know, it doesn't mean that you've been given the right to take those  guns into a, you know, private facility or a public facility or anything like that.  Well, you have the...  You can walk around your house in your underwear with the knotty helmet on with your guns.  Yeah, that's it.  Yes.  No, that's not my interpretation, sir. 
[00:47:30]  Sorry.  Okay.  All right, thank you, sir.  Let's go to Tom in Pennsylvania.  Tom.  Yeah.  Hey.  Good morning.  Hi.  What's up, Tom?  Tom.  Anthony, I wanted to point out that cannons existed when they wrote the Constitution at  that time.  Right.  So if people want to bring in assault weapons and stuff, that stuff existed back then, too.  Oh, like a cannon? 
[00:48:00]  Well, no one's going to...  Actually, people do own cannons.  They take them to little shows, and they fire them off, and boom, and do, you know, fun  things like that, but I, you know...  You think they had school shootings way back when, instead of assault rifles, they came  in with cannons and set it up?  Cannons.  Just set it up all nice.  I don't think so.  No?  It took too much time?  Yeah.  Yeah, cannons existed.  I don't know.  We're not allowed to own cannons. 
[00:48:30]  So that argument's off the table.  It's off the table.  All right.  But, I mean, look at the plantation owners and stuff.  Yeah.  Where they had property to protect.  Yeah.  I think that they would have cannons to make sure that the Indians would not take over  their property.  Yeah, I think we're past that.  I think laws have been made, you know, to kind of keep people from having cannons and  shooting them at the Indians.  I think at this point we need a professor, because we're all falling apart. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  We're all falling apart.  We need a homework assignment now.  Thank you, Tom.  Jimmy, enjoy your birthday.  Thank you very much, sir.  So far, it's been a monumental bust.  As well it should be.  Oh, I like my birthday.  Hey, why don't we take a break?  All righty.  That was a terrific first hour.  Let's make birthday plans for me.  Nope.  Oh.  What to do?  Where's the big surprises?  We got Reverend Allen.  Oh, what a surprise.  Honeymooners? 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  Reverend Allen, WWE on the way.  We got Andy Rooney.  He hates fucking vacations.  That's his latest thing.  Gets paid a lot of money to talk about how he hates vacations.  Of course, he's got to have no fun on vacation.  None whatsoever.  What kind of fun could he possibly have?  Is Mike Rowe coming in today or tomorrow?  Today's the day?  Yes.  All right, it's not on the sheet.  I wasn't sure.  What time?  I think our old pal Mike Rowe's coming in.  We haven't seen him in about a year.  Yeah.  He's coming in around 730.  Wait, now I'm getting word that the original wording was wrong, and it is tomorrow. 
[00:50:00]  Okay, so Mike Rowe tomorrow.  So mark your calendar.  Yes.  And Dana White happens to be in New York City.  He called us up and said, hey, can I stop by and hang with you guys?  Dana White from the UFC will be here as well.  Quick break.  We'll be back.  Opie and Anthony.  Travis, I'm not dumb.  I know why he's playing this.  Yeah?  Happy birthday, Les.  Happy birthday. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, how old is Les?  Forty-six.  Forty-six?  Which song is this, though?  This isn't My Name is Mud, is it?  No, this is DMV.  They all sound the same to me.  I know that's going to piss off Primus fans, but...  His bass playing style.  I actually like Primus.  I just don't know the songs.  Opie and Anthony.  Also, we say happy birthday to an old friend. 
[00:51:00]  Andrew Dice Clay is 52 today.  Is he?  Wow.  That's his birthday today.  Is that what he's saying and he's sticking to it?  I think it's about right, though, Ant.  Yeah?  Yeah, he is, actually.  He's kidding.  He had a nice early start to his career.  Yeah, he did.  Wow.  Only 52.  I mean, we were just kids when we were, you know, listening to Dice.  I was 18 the first time I saw Dice.  I was dating a girl named Michelle, who I actually just saw for dinner, the first girl I ever had sex with. 
[00:51:30]  I was 18, she was 15.  And I remember her calling me into the living room and going, come in here and watch this guy.  He's so dirty.  Oh.  And I fucking sat down and that fucking idiot was in it.  I fucking howled watching him.  I mean, it was a Dangerfield special.  And I laughed harder watching him than I probably almost ever had at a comedian.  Right on.  It's weird how you remember the first time you see certain people.  I remember the first one, too.  It was pretty much the same thing, the Dangerfield thing, and I was watching it, and I could not even convey to my friends what I had seen. 
[00:52:00]  Because then I went out and hanging out with all my pals, and I was trying to tell them what this...  I go, you've got to see this fucking guy.  And they're like, oh, funny comic?  I go, no, no, this goes beyond what we've known as comedy over the past, you know, years of watching comics.  Just insane.  First time you saw him.  Isn't it weird how you just, you never know, like, how things work out?  Like, that, like, that, I, 18 years old, I wasn't even sober when that happened. 
[00:52:30]  And then all of a sudden, you know, if I knew that that guy was going to change my life, which I hadn't even started yet, and bring me to two other guys, one of who, I don't know if you weren't in radio in 86, and fucking, or whatever that was, and you were doing what you were doing.  No, I wasn't in radio in 86.  Were you in radio in 86?  Were you just starting?  Had a few years under my belt.  Oh, did you?  This is all I know.  I started as a fucking teenager.  I was like a fucking Doogie Howser.  Spuds Buckley?  Oh, yeah.  Fucking, no, I started when I was 18, my friend. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I mean, I wasn't broadcasting to anybody.  It was a little, it was a little AM station in Geneseo that only broadcasted to the dorm, so I guess technically it wasn't even an AM station.  They just had some receivers in dorms, so a few people in the dorms got to hear me spin some David Bowie records on our radio.  Wow.  David Bowie into Lucky Star by Madonna.  That was, wow, that was a lot of fun.  What?  They're bringing this Zazi, this terror suspect, into Brooklyn Court today, and wow, the security they got on this son of a bitch. 
[00:53:30]  I don't understand that.  I don't get it either.  Make him walk in a court by himself.  Take your chance.  Take your chance.  Right.  Someone wants to, you know.  It's an insult when they bring these suspects in like that.  With bulletproof vests.  Yeah, right.  Have a cop with them.  Decoy cars.  A cop, you know, holding onto his arm while he is handcuffed.  That's all.  It's an insult to everybody to have such security for an animal like this. 
[00:54:00]  Does anything smell better than a toasted fucking popcorn?  God damn it, Kenny.  Now I need one.  Oh, is that?  God damn.  It's delicious.  And who says that we need all that security around an animal like this?  Yeah.  Is there an actual like law, a rule?  What is it?  I think it's, you know, you're presumed innocent.  No, I understand that.  So, all right.  You need a cop or two to make sure you get into court, whatever.  But decoy cars and whatnot, like you're saying? 
[00:54:30]  They don't want the old Lee Harvey Oswald.  Oh, really?  That was a bit of an embarrassment for the authorities.  Oh, hi.  Yeah.  Look at all the security we got.  And who's this gentleman?  Would that be an embarrassment if that happened?  Yeah.  It would be an embarrassment.  For who?  Technically.  Technically.  I'll go with technically.  The FBI and the NYPD and anyone else that's escorting this gentleman.  What the hell is that?  Ring-a-ding-ding.  Ring-a-ding-ding.  What am I, at a Broadway show? 
[00:55:00]  Do you think Hugh Jackman was pissed?  Yeah, Hugh Jackman got a little pissy.  We don't have, the audio, the audio sucks, but there's a play or a Broadway show.  What is it?  Is it a musical?  Is it words?  What is it?  It's Wolverine and James Bond.  Oh, that sounds pretty cool.  And they are in a play together.  Is it Fruity?  Where they team up and fight crime with fancy gadgets and claws.  That's the play?  Is it called Yuck?  No, it's not.  What is the play for real? 
[00:55:30]  Because you got two guys that are just lunatics.  Daniel Craig and Hugh Jackman.  What is the play about?  I don't know, but they're sitting on an empty stage on two chairs just sitting there.  Is there anything worse than going to a show and it's an empty stage with maybe a couch or a chair?  Dude, the acting is what people come for.  Get me some scenery immediately and some lighting.  Yeah.  It's one dumb white light.  I want to see something.  Really?  You're that good that I got to sit here for two hours and look at you on an empty stage by yourself? 
[00:56:00]  That's a dialogue.  Although, what's his name from a Bronx tale?  He pulled it off.  Yes, he did.  But there was definitely some scenery there.  That's a one-man show, too.  A few couple set changes.  It was funny when you said, get me some scenery quick.  Get me some scenery.  Look, if I'm going to be dragged on stage.  Look, I don't mind going down there every once in a while and catching a show if it's like bigger than life shit.  Yeah.  I don't mind.  Yeah.  But it's just this crap. 
[00:56:30]  No, man.  It's about the art of acting, man.  Just sit there and you're mesmerized and you don't need the scenery.  The dialogue almost paints the picture of the scenery behind.  Shot it.  You don't agree with that?  No.  Look at his facial expressions.  They say so much.  So much.  Do you want a synopsis?  I certainly do.  I want a synopsis of this.  It's called A Steady Rain.  A Steady Rain.  Put some fucking umbrellas on the stage.  That's what I had.  Maybe a pair of moist galoshes. 
[00:57:00]  That's what I had in Roscoe, New York with stupid Bobby Kelly.  I don't need a steady rain.  A steady rain.  The story.  A chubby fly fisherman.  And his radio friend.  Dude, I'm an angler.  No, you're not.  You're fucking circular.  Steady Rain is about two Chicago police officers.  Lifelong friends.  The men find they have very different accounts of a few harrowing days that ultimately change their lives forever.  Is it spelled R-A-I-N or R-E-I-G-N? 
[00:57:30]  How could it be harrowing if there's no scenery?  How are they going to show harrowing without scenery?  So like Hugh Jackman and Daniel Craig are conveying these stories to each other that they remember, but they remember them differently.  And how they change their lives while sitting on a chair and getting angry at bleeping cell phones.  Hugh Jackman is like a jumble word. 
[00:58:00]  It's like Hugh Jackman.  You move a couple of the letters around and man, it's going to say something pretty outrageous.  It's so close.  Who knows how big his Ackman is.  Yes, it's huge.  Me more money.  Huge bomb man.  Oh, boy.  So it's harrowing.  Harrowing.  So what happened?  So Hugh Jackman is really getting into his acting and a cell phone went off. 
[00:58:30]  Apparently this was a very intense part of this.  Something tells me everything's intense in this play.  They're just sitting in a chair.  It better be intense.  And he is, you know, he is the actor when it comes to Broadway.  He'll do Wolverine.  You know, he'll fucking pop out the old pop culture movies.  But when it comes to his Broadway stuff.  He takes it very seriously.  Oh, does he ever.  He hosted the Tonys.  You think he wants to do some Shakespeare in the Park? 
[00:59:00]  Is there anything worse than Shakespeare in the Park?  No, there's not.  I was stunned to find out he had a wife and children.  I was stunned.  I was so convinced Hugh Jackman was a gay gentleman.  Really?  Just by the way he carries himself when he's not Wolverine.  Well, just by his name.  And of course, oh, in the prestige.  Oh.  You think he knows Shakespeare?  Shakespeare in the Park?  What does Shakespeare in general?  Oh, he could probably blurt out some Shakespeare. 
[00:59:30]  You think he acts with a skull?  Oh, yes.  Alas, poor Yorick.  I knew him.  Yes, he acts with his skull.  They told me I wasn't very good at Shakespeare.  Because I didn't put the immortal.  I was like, alas, poor Yorick.  I know him.  I know that, dude.  Shakespeare sucks dicks.  Yeah, he really was.  Oh, I heard that's accurate, too.  You're the immortal bard?  How dare you?  You guys did Shakespeare in high school or college or something, right?  No. 
[01:00:00]  You never had to fucking read through that Shakespeare shit?  And try to figure out what the hell he meant?  Because the language was different?  Because I didn't go there.  I was visiting.  I was too busy listening to rock and roll music and bad mouth in my country.  You can be standing tall before the man.  Give me some fortunate son, will you?  A little CCR for Jimmy.  Vietnam Jimmy.  Yeah.  I love it.  Are you ready for Vietnam Jimmy?  I love it.  I am.  So he got, yeah, Hugh Jackman got a little angry.  Yeah, I don't know if you could hear it or not. 
[01:00:30]  Well, we could try.  Yeah, let's give it a whirl.  This is TMZ.com.  I still see his face.  All the time, his face.  Oh.  You want to get there?  You want to get it?  Grab it.  I don't care.  It's mad.  Get out of your phone.  It doesn't matter.  He's all mad, Anthony.  He's pissed.  Because the phone rang.  He's out of character.  It's still ringing. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, my God.  Nobody wants to pick it up.  As much as I want to make fun of Hugh Jackman.  He's right.  Yeah.  Come on.  That's an awful lot.  You got a minute of story.  You want to get on 30 stories?  Ugh.  Wow, is he angry.  I don't blame him.  I don't blame him either.  Of course not.  It's still a dumb play with no scenery, but.  Of course, you know, you can't blame him.  The thing is, these fucking people.  How do you walk in to a Broadway show and they remind you? 
[01:01:30]  Five times they remind you.  To shut that fucking cell phone off and some self-centered douchebag, not listening asshole  just sits there and lets it ring and ring and ring.  It's probably somebody that came in late.  That's what just happened to you while we're trying to entertain.  I can give a shit about this show.  Your timing is horrendous.  You just turned off your phone.  There's no sign that says turn off your cell phone before you enter here.  Your timing is horrible.  And it was one ding.  They could have thought maybe it was part of the play. 
[01:02:00]  I'm going to make...  Kenny's new job is to remind us to turn off our cell phones before we broadcast.  Please turn off all cell phones.  You know, Billy Crystal one time...  I mean, your rant was great, Ant, but I mean, it came literally a minute after your phone  was ringing.  Well, this is different than a Broadway show.  And if this show was a different, like, attitude...  I'm just fucking...  No, but you're right.  You're right.  But if it was a different, like, attitude, you definitely would, uh...  Yeah.  Jimmy, I interrupted you.  I'm sorry.  It's okay, man.  I was saying, Billy Crystal one time, doing his play, had so many... 
[01:02:30]  They make the announcement, and he actually stopped and said, he really...  Do we play that audio here?  Maybe I'm telling you guys the audio we played here.  And he was right, though.  He was like, he really was furious that the people's phones kept ringing.  It's like...  What?  Nothing.  Sorry.  But it's a matter of you're trying to do something, and, um...  You know, it's, uh...  You're trying to make a point, and you're trying to get...  Something Accomplished.  And you say in the beginning of the show, you're like, look, could you please turn off 
[01:03:00]  your cell phone, because it's distracting.  And so people are supposed to reach down, I carry a phone, I'm responsible with it.  But, uh, what they do is they just don't care about anybody but themselves.  And I don't comprehend, how do you not put it on vibrate?  It's like, we fucking got it!  I hope someone else is hearing that.  That's the sound I hear when other people are talking. 
[01:03:30]  That's how self-centered I am.  Could you do that again?  Hold on, I'm arguing with my girlfriend.  You're being a fucking bitch!  Apparently you've said something to me, too, honey.  I can't hear it.  Ah, shit.  Steven S. from Bayshore, you know, the woman in the audience with the phone ringing during  the play?  Steven S. writes, from what I understand, the guy was getting a tweet from OP Radio.  Was that it?  I don't tweet as much as I was last week. 
[01:04:00]  I'm trying to slow down a little bit.  Was that a woman whose phone went off?  Did he address her?  Oh yeah, he fucking addressed her.  And then supposedly another phone went off.  It was two different phones.  It would have to be, because a guy usually has that phone in a pocket, so it's easy to  just dive in, click a button, and shut that fucker off.  It's in my purse.  I can't find it.  I'm here to see Daniel Craig.  He was so sexy as James Bond.  And it's just ringing and ringing. 
[01:04:30]  Stop it already.  That play sounds horrendous.  Why don't they make a movie?  Because then you could have car crashes and stuff.  I don't know, man.  I've been to a few plays.  I tell you, Chaz's I really liked.  Bronze Tale ruled.  That was a good play, man.  I think that was the last time I went.  Yeah, me too.  I think.  Daniel Craig is just sitting there like a lump of shit in a chair, not saying a word.  He's just like, where is my James Bond checks? 
[01:05:00]  Where are my James Bond checks?  Do you know how hard it is?  I've got to say this, though.  Like, as an actor.  Well, yes.  To fucking paint a picture for real and to really be good at this is really hard, man.  That's big.  Two guys on a fucking...  It looks easy, but two guys to create a believable ambiance with two men.  Like, a believable push and pull between...  Like, you don't realize that when you're watching dialogue of guys who are really good until  you go into an audition, like I have, and realize I am a flat, horrible bag of shit and 
[01:05:30]  I'm connected to nothing.  Not these words.  But these guys actually have motivation and they connect.  A great actor is fucking...  It's really impressive.  As much as I like to smash these guys, it really is.  It's amazingly hard to do.  It's pompous to not have scenery.  I'm obsessed with the scenery thing.  You know, at least a table.  Yeah, they're conversing over a table.  Maybe that was just this scene, though.  Who knows what the rest of the...  They said it all was like this.  He's sitting on a dumb chair.  Can we hear any of it, what they were saying before? 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, let's hear it.  It's hard to hear.  Well, it was only half over, or...  Yeah, but it's just...  I just want to hear it.  It's hard to hear.  The applause.  Can you get that?  Whatever that is, can you get it?  Oh, my God.  Wait, just get the phone.  Oh, not Daniel Craig is saying something.  Don't be embarrassed.  Just wait, I've got a little gun. 
[01:06:30]  Just wait, I'm going to get the phone.  Totally out of their play.  Don't be embarrassed.  Just...  You got it?  All right.  All right.  Shit.  Stand with the token hard.  What did he say?  I didn't catch that line.  I think he said, you're a fucking cunt.  Yeah, yeah.  It sounds like...  No, just...  I don't know, Jimmy.  Wow.  That is...  I was just trying to make it funny.  That's really awkward, though.  In the middle of that moment, that phone... 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  And there's really...  Again, that's one thing I love about being a comedian, is you could play that off and make  it funny, but that was obviously not a funny scene.  It would have been totally inappropriate.  You know what would have been great?  If Wolverine jumped off the stage and just sliced the woman's head off with his adamantium  claws.  Huh?  Yes!  Yay!  See, that would have been good.  And then just like, jump off the stage and just fucking chop her head off. 
[01:07:30]  That ain't gonna happen, though.  No, no, because it's just one of the...  It's not real.  It's not allowed to kill people.  It's not really Wolverine.  No.  He goes, don't be embarrassed.  Just grab it.  Just grab it.  Yeah, because out of embarrassment, she's just sitting there going, hoping it stops.  She's probably trying to step on her purse.  Yeah.  Don't ever just break everything in the bag?  There's two fucking major, major stars in Hollywood fucking staring at you like you  cunt picking up.  The whole audience, they all hear where it's coming from.  Yeah.  They're all narrowed.  They've had it narrowed down to two or three people. 
[01:08:00]  Probably the ones sitting there staring straight ahead like they're watching a murder.  Just panicking.  How hard is it to just, you know...  Oh, how embarrassing.  And you know what?  I would love to know how fucking important that call was.  Like, I'd love to know.  Hello?  You're picking up hello?  Hi, what are you up to?  Just being embarrassed to shit right now.  Hi, how are you?  Yeah, hi, how are you?  What are you doing?  I'm just...  I'm nothing.  I was bored.  Figured I'd call you.  How about it was...  Where are you? 
[01:08:30]  Being escorted out of the theater in front of a thousand people.  Wouldn't it be great...  Thank you very much, Evan.  Wouldn't it be great if that was...  More napkins, please.  Jesus.  Oh, fuck.  I was calling you a slob.  Evan brought me a cup of coffee with 300...  111 napkins on it.  I specifically said 300.  He's a wasteful boy.  But imagine if that was her friend with her, who just went out to fuck with her.  Oh, shit, yeah.  That would be good, too.  I know.  Whenever I sit next to fat people in theaters, I always ask for their numbers so I can go  out and call them and have them escorted out. 
[01:09:00]  Excuse me, there's an elephant getting a call.  Perhaps it's from the peanut salesman.  Could you throw him out?  Jesus.  All right, why don't we get into this Andy Rooney thing?  Because, you know, the guy is just terrific.  He's just an American institution at this point.  He certainly is.  This should be in one.  I get it.  This is Andy Rooney.  I got to tell you, man.  Just gives us great TV year after year after year.  Gets millions of dollars to bring us this fine entertainment.  And the other day, the grumpy old man was bitching about vacations. 
[01:09:30]  He hates vacations.  Yeah, why?  We're going to find out.  Andy Rooney, everyone.  I don't know about you, but I'm glad that our new television season has started.  I thought my vacation would never end, to tell you the truth.  That's what tells you your vacation's over?  I thought it would never end, to tell you the truth.  You ever notice when you come back to a hotel and you forgot to check out, your stuff's thrown  all over the front lawn?  You ever have that happen?  And it's embarrassing stuff, like black dildos and men's magazines with all men in them. 
[01:10:00]  You ever have that happen?  Your Eros is spilled all over your luggage.  You ever have your metallic fist fall out of your luggage on your way out of your vacation  hotel?  How do you hate vacation?  No one does.  No one does.  Where do you go?  Even if you go on a shitty vacation, it's still better than work.  Think about it.  In most cases.  Look at this fucking guy.  We're looking at a picture of him. 
[01:10:30]  Where is he going?  A cruise ship.  He's having fun.  A cruise ship for a guy like that.  He would never have fun on a cruise ship.  A cruise ship with some shuffleboard.  Why are you?  You ever notice when your flight to Somalia is delayed?  Your vacation starts late?  You ever watch a clitoral circumcision on the beach?  He's not going anywhere fun.  And his fun is going through knickknacks and trying to figure out how he's going to fucking  talk about it on 60 Minutes. 
[01:11:00]  It's been one damn day off after another.  Wow.  If summer had lasted another month, I'd be exhausted from all that relaxation.  What a piece of shit.  He really is.  He gets the summer off from that easy job of his?  Yeah.  And he's bitching?  He's so...  You know why?  Can you imagine if all of a sudden they go, you know what, guys?  Take every summer off.  Would we come back in the fall and bitch that our summer vacation's over?  We would.  He's petrified that...  No, I mean bitch that we were on summer vacation.  I'm sorry.  He's petrified that he's going to get back and it's going to be... 
[01:11:30]  All of his stuff is going to be in the dumpster behind CBS.  It's going to be like about Schmidt.  His wife's going to have her shoe askew while the vacuums are still running.  His leg on the floor.  Think about his job, though.  He looks around his office, picks something up, and then he talks about it for two minutes  every once in a while.  I don't even think he's on weekly.  Penis pumps.  Right.  What are these things?  Penis pumps.  And then he gets the summer off.  Yeah. 
[01:12:00]  Gets the whole summer off.  What a fucking...  Can you imagine anyone that gets the whole summer off and then, you know, a week for a  Jewish holiday after having a couple weeks off for the end of summer?  It would be great.  I would take that deal.  No kidding.  Is the part-timer working today?  Do we know?  I have no idea.  I don't think the part-timer's working today.  We bring you your live programming.  We are the workhorses of SiriusXM.  Can we have a big stinger? 
[01:12:30]  The workhorses of SiriusXM.  I'm Opie and Anthony.  And then a...  Something.  And lasers.  We got to bring lasers back into our production.  Danny, can we get lasers?  Absolutely.  A lot of pew, pew, pew.  I'll make sure Derek gets on it right now.  Lasers.  Something with workhorses.  I want people to understand who's really working around here.  Yeah, good luck.  I mean, someday we want to be the part-timers.  We understand that.  Good luck getting people to understand anything.  I'm just saying for the show.  Like, I care what they think. 
[01:13:00]  I'm just saying.  I just like coming in here and doing the radio show with you guys.  It's fun.  And mocking everything.  But we get in trouble for mocking everything.  Yes, we do.  That's always been our problem.  I'm tired from my vacation.  Why?  I go to basketball camp.  You go to basketball camp?  Yes, I'm 75 years old.  And I play basketball with a bunch of inner-city African-Americans in Chicago.  Don't you hate when you're tired after being trampled on the court for eight hours a day?  I scored one point all summer. 
[01:13:30]  Let's see.  Let's get back into the interview.  What was this vacation about?  We're going to find out.  From all that relaxation.  I can stand a little vacation.  But they're getting ridiculous.  Too many people are making a living off the rest of us taking time off.  My idea of a good restful week is to get up at the same time every morning, eat breakfast, read the newspaper, go to work, come home tired, have dinner, read a little something, watch television, and then go to bed. 
[01:14:00]  He forgot something.  That's what I call relaxing.  My idea of relaxing is to wake up every morning, clean the shit out of my pants, then have breakfast, re-shit my pants, talk to a relative who's only being polite because I might die soon, and they'll inherit my money, and then pass out on the floor.  What the fuck was his?  That's on CBS, right?  That's not some dumb podcast from some youngster trying to make it on YouTube. 
[01:14:30]  That is his idea of a vacation is working.  Right.  What the hell are they doing on Channel 11 News?  I'm talking to Bob Kelly about something.  Dude, not that.  You know what?  It's the news.  It's entertainment.  It's news-ertainment.  You got your coffee.  Hey, sit down.  You relax.  Boom.  You learn.  You laugh.  Boom.  You learn.  You laugh.  What an asshole. 
[01:15:00]  As we continue.  Maybe.  I don't know.  Just a thought.  Every morning I woke up during vacation, I'd say good morning to the river.  And then I'd say good night to the river.  It's my friend.  And then we'd sit down for dinner.  And I've just made some darling friends.  Have you?  Is that bit still way too inside?  No, I don't know.  I think it might be way too inside still.  Just be patient.  It'll make sense eventually.  It's wonderful.  Just this weird commercial we hear on the way in about, I don't know, an old age home, 
[01:15:30]  I guess.  But it's terrific because it's right next to the Hudson River.  And the old folk, they say good morning and good night to the river.  Sat at my computer looking at red tube.  Dripping clear stuff.  My ass was all raw.  I had cranky ass by whole vacation.  I like to go to work, come home, watch some red tube and see a girl pink sock while a large gentleman dog fucks her.  You ever see a girl pink sock and then he pushes it back in? 
[01:16:00]  That's fun.  Pink sock.  Have you ever seen Booyah?  The guy shoves the testicles in the girl's asshole, pulls it out and yells something like Booyah.  We got a match.  We got a match.  We play match game around here too as we all try to write.  When I was a kid, Booyah was something you yelled at a rival baseball player.  Now it's something you yell when your testicles are in the hiney of a runaway. 
[01:16:30]  This was just on CBS TV.  He just described a mundane day.  He can't have fun.  No.  He is not a fun guy.  Well, why don't we continue with Andy Rooney?  He hates vacations.  The tiring part of my long break from doing 60 minutes each week is breathing and keeping my heart beating.  That's the tiring part.  When's that going to stop?  And remembering to lift the toilet lid before I went to the bathroom. 
[01:17:00]  I would always forget.  And my wife would find duty all over the seat, mushed into my pants.  I'd clean it up because I don't like vacation myself.  So working's fun.  The tiring part of my long break from doing 60 minutes each week is planning to go somewhere,  getting ready to go there, and organizing everything I need to take with me.  I have to pack.  I have to load the car. 
[01:17:30]  Find the place I'm going to spend my vacation.  And then when it's all over, reverse the whole process and come home.  There are just so many things about summer vacations that are tiring and tiresome  that maybe we ought to give some thought to abandoning them altogether.  How about you?  All right?  Just stay at fucking work.  Some people actually enjoy going out.  A lot of us enjoy our Caribbean vacations.  Having fun.  And our fucking camping and whatnot.  Andy Rooney. 
[01:18:00]  It sounded like he was describing a trip to the bathroom.  Yeah.  Instead of talking about vacations, he's talking about a trip to the bathroom.  Listen.  The tiring part of my long break from doing 60 minutes each week is planning to go somewhere,  getting ready to go there, and organizing everything I need to take with me.  My wipes, the toilet paper.  What was that dumb fucking...  A tongue depressor.  What was that apparatus that we had fun with?  Yeah, the wipe.  The wipe stick.  The wipe stick or whatever it was. 
[01:18:30]  I need a good wipe stick.  And a good five chapters to read.  I sat there a long time.  Nothing happens.  We got Andy Rooney checking in.  Oh, good.  Wow.  I'm glad he listens.  You know, he is a legend.  Andy, how are you?  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Did you ever notice the Mr. Hands video of the horse fucking a man?  Jesus.  Larry King checking in, yes.  Yes.  Larry, a little jealous today because Andy Rooney's getting all the attention. 
[01:19:00]  Andy, how important is the content?  Go.  Apparently, none important.  Then Jim in Rochester, the home of Brother Louise.  Jim.  Jim, I've noticed when you go on vacation, they don't let you bring your hand lube on the airplane.  Legally.  Legally.  And it was a stewardess.  Yes.  Well, the last track is labeled, Andy has not yet made his point.  Once again, he dislikes vacations.  Fucking Sam. 
[01:19:30]  Avoiding work is hard work.  When I'm on my vacation, I don't get enough sleep.  I spend too much money on nothing.  How much for potato chips?  Wait, can I stop this?  He's buying potato chips and hookers.  Potato chips and hookers.  Don't you get the best sleep when you're on vacation?  Yes.  You do a lot of shit, but you're also fucking just relaxing, napping, sleeping.  Whatever you want, you can fucking sleep.  Fucking.  Fucking.  Sucking.  Look at her.  Her womb is so polluted, we can't even have a little baby. 
[01:20:00]  I'm at a point I've got tits.  They've got hair on them.  My wife's friend is Ernie the pig.  Greg in Canada.  Greg.  Greg.  Our neighbor to the north.  Greg.  Ah.  Hey.  Hi there, guys.  Hey, Greg.  I love you guys.  Picked up an XM box from my brother-in-law.  All right.  Boring story. 
[01:20:30]  Sorry.  Guys.  With Andy Rooney, and I think he needs to not abandon vacation, but rather needs to abandon  life.  Ah.  Not funny, but true.  Don't you hate when you want to go on vacation, and your family points you to a cemetery, and  they say, go ahead, Pop.  Sleep by this headstone.  Andy Rooney checking in.  Andy.  Do you ever wonder why Jimmy Norton likes to get fucked in the ass?  Oh, Andy. 
[01:21:00]  Don't you hate when you're trying to have your asshole violated by a young lady, and you have  to poop and fart, so you run and sit on the toilet and go, so loud that she can hear you  with a plastic dick strapped to her in the next room.  Do you ever notice how embarrassing that is?  I'd rather be on vacation.  And I hate vacations.  Do you ever have a finger in your hiney and it really hurts, and you want to say, I think  I have a Roy, but it would kill the mood? 
[01:21:30]  Avoiding work is hard work.  When I'm on my vacation, I don't get enough sleep, I spend too much money on nothing.  How much for potato chips?  $2.50.  $2.50.  I do too much driving, too much eating.  All right, I'll have a root beer shake with an extra vanilla ice cream in it.  And too much talking.  I'll bet that I could add 10 years to my life if I didn't have to take all those vacation  breaks for my usual routine.  And my usual routine is work.  That's why it's so good to be back from my vacation. 
[01:22:00]  Doesn't vacations add years onto your life?  Because you're relaxing?  He's one of those people.  What?  That just don't fucking, they can't enjoy themselves.  They don't know how to enjoy their life.  He is so immersed in work.  Is he married?  Immersed in woodwork.  Like I said, he picks up some dumb item in his office and then figures out two minutes  on it.  Well, that's just it.  That's like his thing.  He must look around and just go, hmm, Sharpie. 
[01:22:30]  What can I do with a Sharpie?  Ever notice that Sharpie is, sometimes they're not sharp.  Sometimes they're a dolly.  Kind of like my segment.  All right, let's go to Andy Rennie.  He must be horrible to live with.  Andy.  He just called in.  Is it him again?  Yeah.  You ever, hey guys, you ever notice how when your producer fucking dies that you get real 
[01:23:00]  worried about your job, so you got to tell them how much you hate vacation so they'll  fire your fucking ass?  Do you ever notice when somebody's not too sure how a call's going to go, they throw in  fuck to hope it makes it stronger?  Do you ever notice how that doesn't work?  Let's go to Andy Rennie.  He called in already.  I don't want to give up on this.  Andy.  I hate when I go to the Windy City on vacation and someone beats my skull till my brains fall 
[01:23:30]  out.  Oh my God.  Jesus.  Don't you hate when you're in the south side of Chicago and you're mistaken for a gang  member and they bounce you and they, and they beat on your stupid sports coat and they  rip it off and they say, die, old white man.  Don't you hate that?  Rather be at work.  I like to vacation at Cabrini Greens in Chicago.  Is that a bad area?  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  All right.  Let's say hi to Larry King, Anthony. 
[01:24:00]  Check it in.  Larry.  Larry.  Larry.  Andy Rooney.  Yeah.  Do you think you would rest better if you took a dirt nap instead?  Olive.  Yeah.  That would be good.  That's the attitude of somebody too.  That is pretty much just waiting to die.  I don't want a vacation.  I'm just going to work until my head hits the old silk pillar.  Bob Kelly checking in.  Oh.  Bobby, what's up?  You know, Andy, you got to relax. 
[01:24:30]  You get cum on your boom.  You got your coffee.  You got to relax on vacation.  You know what?  No.  Oh, as a debut Bob Kelly call, I like it.  We start here.  Boom.  We start here.  You got your cup of coffee, dude.  Boom.  Boom.  You know, you're on vacation, Andy.  Why don't you just relax?  We'll go up to Roscoe.  We'll do some fishing.  You'll love it.  We'll go hunt relics, dude.  It'll be great.  We'll go to Guatemala.  Pick up a relic.  I get a cup of java. 
[01:25:00]  Do you ever notice your friend who's trying to fight a sex addiction and really wants  to be on a table being masturbated by an Asian girl tries to find himself in Guatemala in  Roscoe, New York, but he comes back and he realizes wherever I went, there I was.  Do you ever notice that?  Do you ever notice a spiritually bankrupt person trying to find spirituality outside himself?  Do you ever notice how that doesn't work?  Do you ever notice how a small left-sided face and an older right-sided face psychopath 
[01:25:30]  tries to show you how peaceful he is, like the way he's a peaceful warrior?  Idiot.  He seems to enjoy that fly fishing, though, Jimmy.  He's the worst.  He told me, he goes, dude, I have my gear in the car and I see a river.  I just stop.  He stops and jumps in.  He jumps in the river and I fish.  It's like, dummy, it's a sewage culvert. 
[01:26:00]  What are you fishing for?  What a jerk he is.  Jerk.  We should put the no country for old man, old man haircut on fucking Bobby.  I want to see, I want to see how he would look with that.  He is just a douche.  Well, there's the great Andy Roney.  He's talking about vacation, so we're going to go to break.  Remember yesterday, Ant, E-Rock came in with some audio and it just completely bombed.  Bombed.  Tanked. 
[01:26:30]  It was just like E-Rock, when he hears...  Toast by bagel, you fuck down there.  E-Rock, when a show talks about us, he records the audio and runs it in every single time.  What happened?  It's not hot!  The fuck are you doing?  Fuck, this gave me a goddamn turkey and an American sandwich on a bagel.  Kenny, come in here.  Get in here, Kenny.  God damn it.  Someone's about to be fired.  Kenny, what happened?  There's a few things.  Few things, not one thing.  Icy cold. 
[01:27:00]  Icy cold.  Secondly, an onion bagel and it's got like salt all over it.  Salt on an onion bagel, that's thing number two.  And the bagel isn't barely toasted.  Not barely toasted, it's cold as ice.  Oh, God, did they fuck this up?  What did they do wrong?  Oh, my God.  God damn it, he's not happy.  Throw it in that fucking savage's face.  Yeah, throw it back.  I had a...  It's not your fault.  Of course it's your fault.  Speaking of Kenny, I had a weird moment with him.  We're in the elevator, right?  I gotta wait.  And I know that he calls Jimmy every morning at... 
[01:27:30]  Yes, he's back.  ...at 5.30 to make sure Jimmy's up.  Every morning.  So I'm in the elevator with Kenny and I see the clock in the elevator says 5.30.  So I go, it's 5.30.  You know, because I really thought, which was stupid on my part, because Kenny doesn't forget  anything.  I go, Kenny, it's 5.30.  You know, I know you called Jimmy at 5.30.  At that point, he pulls out his BlackBerry and he goes, no, it's 5.29.  And then waits the extra fucking minute before he called Jimmy. 
[01:28:00]  Wow.  Literally waited.  And not just because he was trying to be silly and kind of like have a little fun back  at me.  He is prompt.  I hate his punctuality.  He needed his BlackBerry to say 5.30 before he called you, Jimmy.  Not 5.29, not 5.31.  It has to be 5.30.  That's the sound they make.  Look, I wasn't hoping for a half-hour discussion.  Praying for a cell phone to go off so you can yell at somebody, horrible joke. 
[01:28:30]  It was just a quick observation, that's all.  Jesus.  All right, why don't we take a break?  So E-Rock came in here with that horrendous audio because the show talked about it, so  you know, he runs it down here, just assuming that we can make gold out of it.  Yeah, yeah.  It fell flat.  We all were like, hummina, hummina, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  We had nothing to say after it was played.  Completely stopped the show, so Sam went backstage with E-Rock.  Oh, no.  Oh, what happened?  You pushed the button.  Oh, no.  I pushed the button.  And it is playing. 
[01:29:00]  But you can't hear it.  Hmm.  I did push the button.  What the fuck happened?  Well, that's very interesting.  Let me try this one.  That was a great setup, too, man.  That was a perfect setup.  And then boom, right to the audio, and then nothing.  Bing.  Boom, right to the audio.  You hit the button.  Boom, you're listening.  You got your cup of coffee.  The fans are entertained.  Boom, it's the show.  It's fun.  Let's all go into a panic when Mars comes into the studio. 
[01:29:30]  Holy shit.  Mars, help me out.  Fucking nothing work.  The goddamn thing was just, oh, my God.  Look, it's playing.  What is that, Mars?  What is it?  It's playing.  What is it?  Look, it's playing.  Mars is wearing his club sort of Kenny wig.  They have the fucking same hairdo.  It sickens me.  I think they both recently got haircuts.  I'm sure they did.  From fucking tarred cuts in the mall.  Jesus Christ.  That's stuper cuts. 
[01:30:00]  Ah, Jesus.  What happened?  What do you mean, what happened?  I just lost your fucking earphone.  Sound, like electricity.  Stuper cuts.  It's working now.  Stuper cuts.  Well, push it again.  See, it's not working.  Stuper cuts.  Sam's running down the hall.  Here comes Sam with another copy.  A Mars guy.  What was it, Mars?  It's unplugged.  Oh, did someone fuck that up?  Who fucked it up? 
[01:30:30]  I was kicking that before.  How come the back of the players are consistently fucked up?  Quickly.  Is the replay?  Yeah.  It gets swapped every day with the one thing.  Yeah, so, but doesn't somebody at this point know to label it?  Who puts it back in?  Put it back together?  No, there should be like one, one, two, two, three, three.  Yeah, Mars.  You got eight with two and one.  What are you doing?  Looking through the wires?  Jesus, fucking Michael handed this better season.  Boo.  Boo.  Oh, wow.  Spiral out of control. 
[01:31:00]  You're lucky he just unplugged my fucking machine.  I know, but he would have done the same to my mic.  Young captain.  Oh, boy.  Now he's looking at where to plug that one in.  Once again, I just want to acknowledge I had a great setup to the bit.  It's okay.  Yeah, yeah, we remember that.  It was amazing.  Who is fucking plugging this shit in all fucked up?  Man, Mars knows.  Who does it?  Mars.  Are we going to just sit here and watch you look at wires for a while?  Yeah, Mars, please.  Oh, you got it?  You don't got it.  Now he's just panicking. 
[01:31:30]  He has no idea.  Of course he is.  Don't think about all these people are listening to you.  Don't think about all the people just waiting for something to happen.  Yeah, Mars.  Nothing's happening.  Look at his freaking house.  Oh, my God.  It's just fucking freaking.  Oh, that one went in there.  Okay, that goes there.  How come that wasn't done before?  What happened?  We're live, Mars.  We're still live.  Yeah, Mars, this is not a fucking rehearsal.  We're live.  This is not the afternoon of the show happening that night.  The show's happening and being spoiled.  You're destroying the show.  At this point, he's just guessing in front of a million people.  Travis the Chimp could do a better job while he's biting that lady's face, using his feet 
[01:32:00]  to put these fucking wires in.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  He's unplugging this.  He's dipping it in water.  Huh?  There we go.  Ah, see?  It's still not working.  Of course it's not working.  That fucking haircut is exactly appropriate for the way this is being handled.  All right, now what?  Mars, what are you doing?  Mars, fix it.  This is live.  Okay, try it now.  Let's see.  Go ahead.  No, it's on.  Boom.  Bing.  No, it's on.  Yeah. 
[01:32:30]  Try the new one.  Yeah, put it in the other one.  Put it in the other one.  The plugs aren't working, but you might as well put it in the other one.  Sam brought in a...  Check the CD.  I pray it was Sam's fault.  Oh, please.  Make it Sam's fault.  It was Sam's fault.  He brought in a new copy.  It works perfectly.  Sorry, Mars.  It was just a broken CD that wasn't burned correctly.  Fucking Sam.  Oh, Sam.  Did you fuck that up?  No, I didn't.  Why?  What happened?  I'm not the one who burned it.  Oh, who burned the original? 
[01:33:00]  Let me think.  Let me guess.  Um, does his name start with an E?  No.  Oh.  An S?  No.  Uh, an E?  No.  A D?  A B?  No.  No.  A T?  A T.  Ah.  Travis?  No.  I don't think Travis.  I was guessing Travis.  Troy Kwan?  Troy Kwan.  Oh, shit.  Come on.  A bag of shit.  What a fucking showstopper he is.  He ruined your shit.  Certainly did. 
[01:33:30]  He ruined everything.  I want to pet a kitten.  They're on TV right now.  I know.  They're showing little kittens for adoption.  All docile.  They're just adorable.  How cute is that?  Look at the kitten.  What's cuter than a kitten?  I challenge you.  Oh, it just went.  Wasn't it a ruckus?  Yeah.  Look at him.  Can someone bring a...  I'm allergic.  So me too, but I still want to pet one.  Someone bring up a little kitten.  Really?  Then when we're done playing with it, we can smash it.  I had a weird dream that I was in Siegfried and Roy's house. 
[01:34:00]  This is true.  During the ass fuck segment of your...  I was in Siegfried and Roy's house and their fucking giant...  Oh, that one.  The ears on that thing are so back.  You think the cat's angry?  Fuck.  What do you think the problem is with the cat?  Cat wants no part of that fucking...  I love angry cat.  That is the angriest cat you are ever going to see in your life. 
[01:34:30]  You know we have to play the dude yelling at his cat going into break.  You know we have to.  Dude, that cat's ears are so back.  Ears.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wonder why it's in a shelter.  All right.  All right.  Can we...  All right.  Let's go backstage with E-Rock and Sam, and then we're going to play the audio of the  guy just screaming at his cat over and over again.  One of my favorites.  And now, backstage with ONA, here is Primetime Sam Roberts. 
[01:35:00]  On Primetime Sam Roberts, Opie and Anthony producer, E-Rock, brought a clip of Covino and  Rich talking about Opie and Anthony to the show.  With a little to do with anything remotely entertaining, the show hosts and audience were  left puzzled as to why the clip would ever be isolated and rebroadcast with the expectation  of discussion.  We found Rich from Covino and Rich in the clip being replayed.  So, Rich from Covino and Rich, E-Rock brought us a clip in today. 
[01:35:30]  Do you remember talking about Opie and Anthony on your show?  I think I just mentioned that on the other show I do, the morning mashup, that they play  cheesy, corny songs when we walk by.  Yeah.  But that's about it.  Yeah.  E-Rock brought it in and shared with the guys the clip from...  Was that show worthy?  No.  Actually, that's the thing.  It wasn't because it was just so quick.  Was there anything that E-Rock was missing or was he just a retard?  Dude, I love him, but he might have just been a retard on this one, to be quite honest. 
[01:36:00]  So, even you, the host of the show, is fully acknowledging what's the point of bringing  that clip in?  I mean, the host of the show, who loves to get mentioned on a cool show like O&A, still  sees no reason why he pulled that clip.  With Rich acknowledging how truly uneventful the clip was, it's obvious who's at fault on  this one.  We interrupted Sex Bagels' third breakfast to get to the bottom of things.  E-Rock, today on the show, you brought in a clip from Covino and Rich.  Yes.  Why did you do that? 
[01:36:30]  Well, they had mentioned the show.  Rich had talked about the bit we were doing with the morning mashup.  So, I just brought it in as a reference piece.  But, I mean, there was literally no point to it.  Well, it's their show.  Ask them.  Who, Covino and Rich?  Yeah.  No, I mean, I'm not faulting them for bringing it up.  Like, as a passing reference, it worked for their show.  But to isolate that and say that was worthy to bring to our show to be a talking point  when there is no point to it, I just can't fathom the thinking behind it. 
[01:37:00]  Well, I never stressed that this was, you know, stellar audio.  I just said, hey, they mentioned us.  So, you just bring subpar audio to the show and say, here's something for you to play.  Sure, why not?  Do you think that reflects poorly on you as a producer?  No, you hit and miss.  So, when will you hit?  I just brought it as a reference point.  That's all.  To what?  Okay, it sucked.  Yes, E-Rock, it did suck. 
[01:37:30]  Maybe one day E-Rock will learn that audio submitted for the show is meant to entertain  the audience, not leave them with a feeling of pure indifference.  Oh, well, at least we can slap his tits.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been Backstage with ONA.  Down!  Fucking jump!  Jump!  Get the fuck down from there! 
[01:38:00]  Fucking jump!  Jump!  Jump!  Do it, you bitch!  Do it!  Jump!  Jump!  Do it!  You fucking pussy!  Jump!  Look at me. 
[01:38:30]  Look at me.  Up here.  Up here.  What the fuck are you looking at?  Don't fucking run away from me!  I'll end you!  Where'd you fucking go?  You son of a bitch!  Don't fucking go in my closet! 
[01:39:00]  Get the fuck outside!  Run!  Run!  Yeah!  Run!  Yeah!  Fuck her! 
[01:39:30]  You are a fucking piece of shit!  I'm going to rape you!  Fuck you!  Run!  Fucking run!  Fucking run!  Yeah!  Don't fucking stare at me! 
[01:40:00]  You fucking bitch!  Jimmy, your Cowboys won last night, Monday Night Football.  Yes, they did.  First win in the new Cowboys stadium.  21-7.  That's going to be exciting for you?  Yeah, I mean, I saw not the whole game.  I tend to watch the end because I'm out doing a spot, but sure.  Yeah, I was happy they won.  And a quarterback I really like. 
[01:40:30]  I liked him when he was on the Jets.  This is Chad Pennington.  Another bad break for him.  Dislocated shoulder.  Again, he's hurt?  Done for the year.  Oh my God.  I don't think that's going to make Big Ken happy.  He's a big fish fan.  Big fish fan.  Yeah.  Dolphins?  Yeah.  Now my Jets are going to just fucking roll all over your team.  Out for the season again?  Is that the second time he's been out for the season, this fucking pussy?  I do believe.  I don't know.  See, this is where our sports talk stops.  I don't know.  So I seem to remember some kind of injury that had him out for a while. 
[01:41:00]  So.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think it was.  He's just a nice guy.  And then Anthony's Yankees won again last night with nothing but scrubs on the field.  No one playing.  And you warned Jimmy because Jimmy was going to go last night.  You went the night before when they clinched the division.  And then Jimmy's like, well, I got great tickets for whatever yesterday.  And you said, don't fucking go because no one's going to be playing.  And that was the case.  I think like Melky was playing.  Yes.  And who else?  Like one other fucking Yankee. 
[01:41:30]  And then everybody else was just.  Jorge played last night.  Oh, did Jorge play?  Yeah.  Aw.  He took up, I think, 13 of the $22 million that was on the field.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Quite amazing.  And they won.  They won against the Royals.  101 wins.  My God.  Yeah.  But that's not going to be their best season ever.  116 was against them.  116 was it?  If you remember, the Yankees kind of started off a little shaky there.  I was kind of mocking you and laughing at you because there was a point.  Travis, could you find when the Mets were ahead of the Yankees? 
[01:42:00]  The Mets actually started off better.  I do remember that the Mets had a better record than the Yankees.  Please, someone do some research and find that out for me because I was making fun of Anthony.  I said, my team is better than your team.  And then there were a few na-na-na-na-na-na's in there.  Na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Na-na-na-na-na-na.  Oh, guys, when the things like that start flying, it gets crazy in here.  I know.  Oh, by the way, dolphins aren't fish.  You're right.  They are mammals.  Yeah, because we always say squish the fish. 
[01:42:30]  But it's the fish because they...  Because it rhymes.  Like, match the hatch.  And it's stupid because they swim like fish.  They're fish.  You take them out of the water and put them on land, they'll die.  Yeah.  You know, you can't do that.  What are we, marine biologists?  Yeah.  The average man goes, oh, look at that fish.  The fish.  That's all we think.  You should never say squish the fish.  Why squish the fish?  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Here's your knowledge coming in from John in Jersey about Chad Pennington.  Chad?  Yes.  Chad Pennington got hurt for the third time. 
[01:43:00]  And I hate to say this, Sophie, but you make me shit when you talk about the Jets.  I'm a diehard Jets fan.  You only come on board when they're winning.  Any Jets fan knows how many times Chad Pennington has hurt.  Yep, exactly.  That's not true, man.  I was...  Let me say that to him.  What the fuck did I say last year when the Jets got Brett Favre?  I said, this is a fucking horrible move by the Jets.  I was pissed off.  I've been following the Jets.  I'm following them a little closer right now because this Rex Ryan makes it exciting. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, but you're from Long Island.  You have to root from the Jets one loss.  I mean, come on.  I know.  It's true.  What?  That's right.  What?  Boomer is sizing.  Yep.  When he came to the Jets, were you rooting for him?  He's a Long Islander.  No, he wasn't.  I had a tough time when they picked up Boomer as well because he was past his prime.  Yep.  You know.  Are you a Kenny O'Brien fan?  Uh, no.  Okay.  You're not a Jets fan.  No.  That's right.  Jimmy's such an instigator.  I say that all the time, though, dude.  I kind of liked Richard Todd because he was supposed to be the new Joe Namath. 
[01:44:00]  Remember?  Yeah, I remember.  Hey, hung up on me this fuck.  The guy's right.  He said, enough with your lies.  Yeah, you watch what we do to the Saints this fucking weekend.  You just watch that game.  That's right.  Best offense in football.  But you know what?  The Jets have a pretty good D, my friend.  Saints have the best offense in football?  I do believe they have the best offense in football, but it's early.  What do we play?  Three games so far?  Hey, that's, you know, a lot of games to just win right in a row, right off the bat like  that.  I openly admit it.  It makes more pressure for the team, though. 
[01:44:30]  But there was something that was going on in the offseason where I said, you know what?  I'm really going to follow the Jets big time this year.  I like the Sanchez move, and I like that we got this Rex Ryan who could drop dead of  a heart attack at any game.  He's got the biggest waist, I think, ever in football.  He is a fatty.  He is giant, and he's walking down.  I'm like, don't walk.  Just stand still.  Yeah.  Don't move around too much.  We need you.  Stand there.  Watch the game.  But I openly admit it.  I'm watching a lot more this year than in past years. 
[01:45:00]  Anyway.  Oh, Ant.  Yes.  Time to pat ourselves on the back.  This is a brand new segment called Pat Ourselves on the Back.  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  The workhorses of satellite radio.  Oh, wow. 
[01:45:30]  Holy shit.  You wanted lasers.  We got lasers.  You got them.  Oh, that was so obnoxious.  What do you want in the next one?  They'll do anything for us, because it's called Pat Ourselves on the Back.  What do you want?  Jimmy, what do you want?  Something with me in there.  Something with Jimmy in there would be nice.  All right.  Something with Jimmy in there for the next one.  Ant, what do you want?  What do you want?  I don't know.  The lasers are good.  The lasers were a little weak.  We need some explosions, too.  Some well-placed explosions, yeah. 
[01:46:00]  Explosions, and Jimmy needs to be in there.  Yeah.  And go.  I'm sure Derek's like, what the fuck?  I got a lot of work today.  I don't need to be bogged down with this shit.  No.  Huh?  He can't possibly have that much work to do.  All right.  Derek?  Here I am walking.  He's smoking outside and living the life of Riley.  I'm drinking his coffee.  With his headphones on, listening to nothing.  Static.  You don't think he listens to anything?  No, he's a fucking weirdo.  He listens to Static or NPR. 
[01:46:30]  Same thing, actually.  Fucking boring NPR.  Well, it was back in mid-May, Anthony, that the Mets were better than the Yankees.  Mid-May.  The Mets were better than the Yankees.  All right.  Yeah.  They just came alive.  You're talking months ago.  Derek likes Kraftwerk?  Kraftwerk.  I know one of their songs, Kraftwerk.  What was their big hit?  Not that they...  I don't want to be there.  Kraftwerk. 
[01:47:00]  Travis is trying to find a little Kraftwerk.  This is Kraftwerk?  This is called Autobahn.  Autobahn?  Ah.  Autobahn by Kraftwerk.  Is this on All Nation?  Because I think I heard one song on All Nation from Kraftwerk.  Ja.  Das chicken's gut, ja.  The Autobahn?  Autobahn.  Get the fuck out of here.  Is this real? 
[01:47:30]  Derek's a fucking Peter Pumper.  Derek likes this.  He doesn't like this.  When does it kick in?  I want to hear about the Autobahn.  Does this song have words?  This is like a bad midi karaoke song.  This is the music that fucking the Duke of New York was driving to.  Is this from Escape from New York? 
[01:48:00]  No, this is...  It sounds like...  Oh.  Hey, Travis, does this ever kick in?  Oh, here we go.  This is good.  This is good.  This is good.  All right, Derek needs to be let go.  Here comes Derek.  Derek, I know you're too busy for this shit, but...  We want to know why you like Kraftwerk.  Put this...  Put the headphones on and give this a listen.  You listen to this? 
[01:48:30]  No, I don't.  I'm not a big Kraftwerk fan.  Well, wait a minute.  Oh, they're just fucking with you?  It said you're a big Kraftwerk fan.  Derek's told me a bunch of times that he likes a couple of Kraftwerk songs.  You like Autobahn?  Um...  Pocket Calculator's a good one.  Not a good one.  Is there any Pocket Calculator?  Pocket Calculator?  Is that the name of the band or the song by Kraftwerk?  It's the name of the song.  Okay.  Operator with my Pocket Calculator.  You don't listen to this. 
[01:49:00]  I don't.  I have in the past.  This is great music if you're fucking, like, if you're doing poppers and another man is  putting his fingers in your ass in an adult theater and you have your headphones on.  Oh.  There it goes.  My Pocket Calculator.  My Pocket Calculator.  I reach into my pockets for my Pocket Calculator.  That's pretty much how it goes, actually.  I add up numbers.  You're supposed to sit with my Pocket Calculator. 
[01:49:30]  I fucked a chicken with my Pocket Calculator.  This really does sound like it belongs on the Revenge of the Nerd soundtrack.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little bit.  A little bit.  This is great.  Back in the day, I was into Tangerine Dream.  What's he doing?  He's working his Pocket Calculator.  I'm the operator with my Pocket Calculator.  This is horrible, dude.  I'm adding.  And subtracting. 
[01:50:00]  It multiplies and divides.  I'm controlling.  And composing.  Composing?  I'm the operator with my Pocket Calculator.  I'm the master beta with my Pocket Calculator.  I'm the operator with my Pocket Calculator.  This is just fucking horrendous.  What was it?  African Bambada is the one that actually kind of made him famous.  Because they sampled from Planet Rock.  It was a Kraftwerk song.  But he's not famous. 
[01:50:30]  Who?  Yeah, he really.  I mean.  How old is this song?  Oh, this is probably like 85.  Oh, is that old?  Oh, really?  Okay, then it's supposed to sound like this.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Then that one song I said might be the music from Escape from New York.  Yeah, you might be right.  No, no, no.  Escape from New York, that was all John Carpenter's original compositions.  Like, he actually wrote the music for a lot.  And maybe I'm wrong.  People are asking if this is a buttery beat.  Not really. 
[01:51:00]  Buttery beats.  My buttery beats are better than this.  I'm talking about the music of Luminous.  A terrific game for the PSP.  I'm the operator of my pocket calculator.  Yeah, it pretty much just goes on like this forever.  Forever.  Yeah.  Forever, forever, forever.  Forever.  I'm the operator whenever I meet a woman I hate her.  All right. 
[01:51:30]  Someone said I'm supposed to know this because they play it on chill.  I like chill every once in a while, but.  Oh, no.  This sucks a dick.  Are you supposed to be on like a substance when you listen to this?  I guess.  I don't know.  What drug would go well with this?  Is this a little E?  It's got to be E.  A little E?  Yeah, if you're going to be dancing to T, if you're going to be mellowing out to this,  then a little mescaline.  Mescaline?  It'll make you laugh.  Shrooms.  Shrooms.  What is the number one band for the meth head? 
[01:52:00]  Meth?  Yeah.  That's got to be fucking like.  Anyone know?  Paradise City.  Shit like that.  Where are my meth heads today?  What's the number one band or song for the meth head?  What do you think?  I would definitely think Guns N' Roses, Metallica.  For meth head?  Fuck yeah.  I say Men Without Hats.  No.  The big safety dance people, the meth heads.  Safety dance.  You can dance if you want to.  You can dance if you want to.  You can leave your world behind. 
[01:52:30]  This works.  Friends don't dance and if they don't dance,  when there are no friends of mine with my calculator.  All right.  All right.  Well.  I am adding.  I am adding.  Derek was right.  It just keeps going.  He's adding and subtracting.  There's other keys on your calculator, dummy.  How about a little division?  Give me a little division.  You're a German.  You're supposed to be good at this stuff.  How about a multiplication?  Ah.  By pressing down for special key, it plays a little melody. 
[01:53:00]  Oh.  Is that it?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Here we go.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Meth heads love sniffing the tears.  Ah.  All right.  Anyone for driver's seat?  Okay.  Sorry.  I ain't digging it.  Uh.  Disturbed.  Meth heads love disturbed. 
[01:53:30]  I tell the Jews, see you later with my pocket calculator.  Yes.  They called me the exterminator with my pocket calculator.  Oscar Schindler was a traitor with his pocket calculator.  Look at the video of Pocket Calculator live in 1981.  Bob Kelly looks like Darth Vader with his pocket calculator.  Dad, you got your pocket, your calculator. 
[01:54:00]  Boom.  Got your coffee, do some math, pay your bills.  Bing.  You head in.  Bing.  Pow.  You subtract.  Yeah, boom.  Times, point, whatever.  Gives you the dip percentage.  Wow.  That's the manager.  Well, a lot of Saints fans checking in.  Telling me to go fuck myself.  That's wonderful.  I've been talking like that.  Well, let's see what happens this weekend.  And then we'll talk.  We'll talk on Monday.  Ooh.  New Alice in Chains.  Meth heads love the new Alice in Chains. 
[01:54:30]  I got that fucking CD just sitting at home and I haven't put it in yet.  Hitler's girl ever was quite a hot tomato.  Oh my God.  I can't say that one, but it has incinerator in it.  Oh, fuck.  Stephen Bashar?  Oh no, that's techiness.  That's funny.  Oh, that's so fucking awful.  My pocket calculator. 
[01:55:00]  So, Derek, you dig that?  No.  Yes, you do.  Give us something you like.  How did somebody say that you like that?  I think because I had like a Kraftwerk tape once.  You did?  Yeah.  Why?  It was like in a bargain bin or something.  I got it for like $2.  Why?  Why did he even pick it up?  I don't know.  He bought it brand new.  Of course he did.  Yeah, he bought it brand new.  Because he likes it.  Columbia House.  He took the plastic wrap off it.  Yeah.  He likes the booklet inside.  It shows you what Kraftwerk does in your spare time. 
[01:55:30]  It's all done in a basement.  What do you like, Derek?  Musical?  Nothing really right now.  There's not a lot of good stuff.  What's on your iPod?  Um, Guns N' Roses, SDP, Soundgarden, Velvet Revolver.  Okay.  You like a certain sound, I see.  Yeah, I like that, you know, early 90s.  It's not my style.  You like Pearl Jam?  No, I'm not a big Pearl Jam fan.  Do you like Alice in Chains?  Yeah, I like Alice in Chains. 
[01:56:00]  Isn't it a little weird seeing Pearl Jam with the Target sign behind him, like doing the commercial  for the new album and the track that you can get free of Target or download like that?  It's just like, it's not that man Pearl Jam thing.  They're just like, man.  That's their deal, though.  They made that deal.  Yeah, but, you know.  It goes against their whole man mentality.  It doesn't seem like.  I don't think so.  And I'm a Pearl Jam fan, but Ant's kind of right.  You know, they're like, man.  He's taking on, man.  They've been taking on the corporation for a long time. 
[01:56:30]  Them and fucking what's who else is doing exclusively Kiss is doing for Walmart.  Well, Kiss has been a whore band their whole career.  Pearl Jam hasn't been that whore, whore band.  But I'm saying all bands that are doing just for these exclusivity in these stores.  But it's not exclusive to Target.  Target is the big box retailer exclusive, but one of the deals of that deal is that  indie record stores had to be able to carry that album.  Whereas, like, the Eagles or ACDC.  Don't try to make them sound cool.  Indie record stores have to go buy the CD at Walmart if they want to stock it in your store. 
[01:57:00]  I don't see the indie store logos up behind them on the screens during the commercials.  Exactly.  When I see Eddie Vedder singing and then Pearl Jam's playing and there's, like, the Target  logo popping up behind them.  Thank you, Anthony.  It seemed a little sellout-ish for them.  Now, for other bands, it's fine.  But they always came off as that.  We're Pearl Jam.  We're anti-establishment.  And now it's like, hey, we've got to sell some fucking records.  We haven't been in the public eye in quite some time. 
[01:57:30]  This is the first album that they haven't had a major label to deal with, so they did  it themselves.  It's the grunge version of the Target logo, too.  It's just hysterical.  It's all crackly and moving.  And Target didn't make them sign a long deal.  I love Target.  I like Target.  It's kind of embarrassing, Travis.  Target stores.  I totally disagree.  I'm a Pearl Jam fan.  You can buy the Target stores.  Target stores.  You can't sing.  You can't sing in front of a Target logo if you're Pearl Jam. 
[01:58:00]  No.  Hey, when Target's paying you...  Target calculator.  When they're paying you five bucks an album and the record company's only paying you two  bucks an album, like...  But it's about the art, man, not about the money, man.  People are like, shut that fucking song off.  That's traffic.  I like this motherfucker.  You like Interpol, Dirk? 
[01:58:30]  People want to know.  No.  No?  I'm not an indie fan.  Kevin from Connecticut, an elderly woman behind the counter at Walmart.  Ah, you're Pearl Jam.  Wait, I like Pearl Jam.  Oh, stop it.  It is a little weird to see that.  Come on.  Tommy writes, hope you just admitted to stealing music.  The new Alice in Chains isn't even out yet.  That's right.  I download all my music for free.  Don't shop at Walmart.  I say go to Target.  You get better deals if you go to Target. 
[01:59:00]  Don't shop at Walmart.  Where did he go?  He's hiding?  All right.  Come here.  That's a rough one.  We agree to disagree.  And while we're at it, fuck your Canadians.  Hockey season starts.  By that he means your family.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Bitch-ass motherfucker.  Not a little Riley.  You tell him, Jimmy.  You tell him.  By the way, gotta ask. 
[01:59:30]  I was down in my bar area last night.  I went into the bathroom to take a little piss-a-rooney and saw a plastic bag in my sink.  Oh, I hope my wife put something there.  And I go...  Because I sure didn't.  I'm like, what is this?  And I lift it up and I almost go to open it.  A fucking diaper.  Nah, I doubt that was us.  It was in a plastic, like a CVS or drugstore bag, you know.  It sure wasn't a...  And just placed in my sink.  You sure it wasn't some hash that someone left behind?  No, I don't think so. 
[02:00:00]  Hiding it in the diaper?  There were only so many babies.  It was either...  It was either...  Let's see.  My brother?  How many babies?  My sister?  That's two.  Or you?  Three.  I think that's the only shitting in fucking cotton babies, right?  I don't know who they were, but they had a three-month-old.  Oh, they did?  Yeah.  Oh, maybe it was them.  Maybe it was them.  All right.  You know, I like to put mine in the pool.  I'll do some DNA testing on it.  Does Kraftwerk have a song called DNA? 
[02:00:30]  DNA, whose duty is that?  DNA, whose duty is that?  Whose duty is that?  We could do that.  They make a lot of money doing shitty songs like that.  Which one is this?  This is music nonstop.  There's no shit.  There's computer love in there?  Oh, my God.  See, you know.  I know a lot.  I know a lot.  Let's go to computer love.  Let's go to computer love.  Computer love.  Oh, you got it? 
[02:01:00]  It's kind of cool if you have headphones on.  No.  It's moving all over.  My brain sucks.  Is this computer love?  Yeah, this is computer love.  All right, let's listen to computer love.  This is a lot different than calculator.  CokeLogic wants to defend Pearl Jam 2.  All right, well, hold on the line.  Good luck.  Oh, yeah, he loves those guys.  You know what he's singing about like a fucking Tandy back then? 
[02:01:30]  Atari 600 with a membrane keyboard.  Coldplay sampled this.  That's where I've heard it.  Really?  It's off of, it's on Talk.  Computer.  Computer.  They really take their time getting to the point, huh?  Red tube on the computer.  I watched Red Tube. 
[02:02:00]  What?  Ah, I hear the Coldplay thing in there.  Yeah, I mean, they've inspired a lot of people.  Fucking Coldplay rips off everybody, huh?  My huge five-inch monochrome monitor on my computer.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Stoppy disks.  Keep this playing as CokeLogic defends Pearl Jam.  Of course I'm going to keep it playing. 
[02:02:30]  CokeLogic.  Hello.  Hey, CokeLogic.  Pearl Jam is on their own Monkey Wrench label record thing now.  It's like this independent thing, so.  But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, a lot of bands are doing that.  All right.  It's not like they're, like, setting some kind of crazy new trend.  Exactly.  Okay.  All the bands are doing their own thing and avoiding the record companies.  Not all, but a lot.  Record company, Schmecker company, now that you really don't need the whole distribution  thing, we're just putting it online. 
[02:03:00]  So, how do you want to defend them, though, against that Target logo?  Well, let me go the long way around it, is that Eddie actually said, you know, Target  only carries maybe 300 CDs in their store.  You know, this is a great way to be a part of them, since they don't have their own distribution.  So, kind of like the way that ACDC, ACDC never sold out, yet they have an exclusive  deal with Walmart for their, what is it, Black Ice album? 
[02:03:30]  Um, you know, it's just, it doesn't matter about music, you gotta be in a store to reach  certain people that don't even do the, Mr. Logic, of the Coke variety.  Let me, let me say, though, ACDC never, also never went around, like, with the, that whole  anti-corporate attitude that Pearl Jam had, uh, gone around with for, for years and years  during their grunge years.  See, this seems to me to, uh, reek of hypocrisy. 
[02:04:00]  Not that I give a shit, I'm just saying, it was a little, it was a little weird.  I, I, if I saw any other band, it wouldn't bother me.  Like, you hear Rolling Stones or Aerosmith during a Cadillac commercial or something like  that, I don't even think about it, who cares?  But, like, Pearl Jam, to see the Target logo behind them, it just kind of made me go like,  wow, that's, that's a little odd.  I didn't say fuck Pearl Jam up there, bung holes, but, uh, just a little weird, I thought.  That's all.  Basically, Pearl Jam, there were a bunch of sellouts there, Coke Logic. 
[02:04:30]  That's all I'm trying to say.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  Bunch of sellouts.  All right, there goes Coke Logic.  Thank you, sir.  Uh, and, and thank you to, uh, Kevin from Connecticut.  Yes.  Where's Dieter to dance to this crap?  Oh.  Dieter.  This is some awful music.  It's a fucking sample from Coldplay, which when, when I heard Coldplay do it, I was like,  wow, that's a cool original sound.  Really?  But they ripped it off from Kraftwerk.  See?  Oh. 
[02:05:00]  Same thing.  Holy shit.  Same thing.  And this was a big song for Coldplay.  Computer.  Computer.  My Texas Instruments TI-99-4A.  My computer.  My computer.  My Sinclair ZX81 computer. 
[02:05:30]  Vince from Bayonne said your computer knowledge was a little offhand.  Oh.  Yeah, you see, uh, Professor Anthony, the Atari 400 had the membrane keyboard.  The 600 had a real keyboard.  Uh, excuse me.  Excuse me.  The 800 had a real keyboard.  The Atari 800XL had the, uh, real keyboard.  Go to Atari, uh, 600.  Uh, 600. 
[02:06:00]  Hey, the 600XL has a real keyboard.  Oh, oh, what is that one?  I have no idea.  400?  Let me see.  Show me 400.  How can you tell by looking at a picture of that garbage?  All right, now, now, go down.  What is that?  Good.  I'm an ass fuck.  I don't even know what that is.  Right, that's an Atari 400.  All right.  I thought they only had 600 and 800.  I'm sorry, sir.  I'm sorry.  Oh, let me say hi.  I'm sorry.  And you've really got the Pearl Jam fans lit. 
[02:06:30]  Jeff and Kiana.  Jeff, actually, I think Jeff might agree with you.  Jeff, you agree with Ann, or?  Well, I'm saying Pearl Jam's been sellouts forever because, really, you can turn it to  any radio station, any time, and you'll at least hear even flow up on six of them.  Well, that's not their fault that radio decided to, you know.  Yes, it is, man.  They put out a catchy song, you know, and people are going to want to play it.  I'm just saying that it was, the commercial itself was weird. 
[02:07:00]  If they did an exclusive deal with Target and everything, that's fine.  Just to see them playing and the whole Pearl Jam attitude and then seeing that Target logo  in grunge behind them was weird for me, that's all.  And let's stop.  Every band.  This music?  Oh, yeah.  Let's stop the music.  Every band wants to be a sellout.  Of course.  Stop with this bullshit that they didn't want to be sellouts.  It's a bunch of crap.  There are bands that don't want to be sellouts.  Name a band that definitely didn't want to be a sellout. 
[02:07:30]  Exactly.  We don't know them because they don't want to be sellouts.  No, because they haven't made it to the sellout stage yet.  But they're trying.  But what if they're not trying and they're just not sellouts and they're...  The only person I could come up with...  It's the tree falling in the forest.  Do you hear it if nobody's there or something?  The only person I would throw on the table, as far as this discussion goes, is Gigi Allen.  I don't think he wanted to be a sellout because I don't think corporate America was going  to really pick up on the fact that he would shit in his head and throw it at his audience. 
[02:08:00]  You didn't see that?  Yes.  He could have taken his own ass blood and painted a Target logo on his face.  This banana and the asshole sponsored by Chiquita.  Yeah.  I don't think Gigi Allen had corporate America in mind when he did half the shit he did.  Gigi.  So I would say Gigi Allen.  He was terrible.  But like the Sex Pistols even, come on.  He got quite popular.  Here's Gigi Allen.  Yeah, of course it's Gigi Allen.  This is Suck My Ass It Smells.  Yeah. 
[02:08:30]  Suck My Ass It Smells.  Gigi, could you change the name of your song?  I don't think we could get it on the radio for you.  It's just awful.  We can't have DJ say Suck My Ass It Smells.  I'm sorry, sir.  The radio edit.  This is Cornhole Lust.  Cornhole Lust, Jimmy.  Cornhole Lust.  He really loved asshole music.  You don't think Gigi Allen...  Jimmy's getting mad.  What's wrong?  It's just fucking childish noise.  Hey, shut up.  Just meaningless lyrics. 
[02:09:00]  Now, Eric...  It's phony rebellion.  Just a guy who likes to throw shit at people.  A monkey.  That looks fucking horrible.  Eric Fisher writes from Virginia Tech,  Kurt Cobain wasn't big on the whole sellout idea.  Bullshit.  What?  And I'm a big Nirvana fan.  Kurt Cobain wanted to fucking sell out.  He did sell out.  Well, he couldn't fucking deal with it, though, I guess.  Well, he had some of those demons, but...  Maybe the reason that they got popular  and it became this big thing  and he became like a fucking, you know, 
[02:09:30]  Tiger Beat cover guy,  maybe that fucking fucked him up.  Maybe he didn't want to get that far.  Nah, come on.  Maybe.  His songs were very poppy,  if you really think about it.  He invented a new sound, for sure,  and did it differently than the bands that came before him,  but the guy wanted his songs to be heard by a lot of people.  Absolutely.  He sold out at Nevermind and MTV videos.  Oh, well, well, well, well, well.  I think he might have got bored with the whole thing  and he wanted to try to move on to other things,  sort of like what John Lennon tried to do after the Beatles. 
[02:10:00]  But there was a point in Kurt Cobain's life  where he was writing these songs  hoping a lot of people would hear them.  There it is.  Success Doesn't Suck.  Nirvana, the Rolling Stone interview with Kurt Cobain.  Here's the annual music awards.  Also, Pearl Jam, Dr. Dre, Soul Asylum,  Cypress Hill, Janet Jackson,  Beavis and Butthead.  Oh, Beavis is the winner.  Butthead is the loser.  Annual music awards, the loser,  STP, Meatloaf,  Whitney Houston, 
[02:10:30]  Suede,  and Michael Bolton.  Liz Phare.  Liz Phare.  Liz Phare, babe, and Boyland.  Let's go to Matt in Queensbury.  Awful cover.  Matt in Queensbury.  Hey, guys.  Coke Logic, I wanted to help him on his fight there  about Pearl Jam.  You know, like,  like, Kip has an exclusive deal with Walmart  and, you know, they're not sell-outs.  Nobody's ever accused them of trying to sell-out.  All right.  I can tell sarcasm from 50 miles out. 
[02:11:00]  I don't think KISS is sell-outs, though.  No?  I honestly don't.  No, because they're...  No?  Because, dude, they've always done...  They've always marketed the band that way.  It's like, they've always been...  For pictures,  they've always had, like, dolls.  They've always had that kind of marketing.  Let me just say this to you, then.  You're saying...  You're not saying KISS isn't a sell-out.  You're saying they've always been sell-outs.  No, I'm saying that they never...  Selling out, to me, to me, selling out  is not marketing yourself smart.  Or it's not... 
[02:11:30]  That does not define a sell-out.  It doesn't define a sell-out mass appeal  or, you know, doing a comic book.  A sell-out, to me,  is pushing one set of ideals  and being strong about one set of ideals  and then changing them for a big payday  or for something else  and selling out what your ideals were.  But just being popular  and marketing the band smart...  They...  Let me tell you something.  It's not a sell-out.  I remember the 70s version of KISS.  Sure.  Not even close to being the sell-out 
[02:12:00]  that they are now.  I disagree because KISS...  Oh, my God.  No, no, I'll tell you why.  Because KISS didn't have, back then...  There weren't as many outlets  for interviews and stuff.  Plus, they're older now.  But they were always, like,  this kind of mass-marketed band.  Fucking...  They had the KISS comic book,  KISS color forms, KISS van.  Like, when I was a kid, man,  you had KISS doll...  Every KISS playing cards.  So they had everything KISS  just like it is now.  But it's only, like,  Gene's older now,  does more interviews.  Paul does more...  They're more general businessmen now.  They invented selling out. 
[02:12:30]  Gene does more commercials now.  Yeah.  It's not even considered  a fucking interview  when all he does  is plug his shit.  But that's not...  I'm telling you,  that's not selling out, man.  They've always been  mass-marketing guys.  They're smart marketers.  It's only a sellout  if you claim to be one thing  and then all of a sudden  change when it's convenient for you  or when it's convenient for money.  That's the little girl  from the fucking...  What?  What happened?  Where they take her  in the van ride  and they drive  to the beauty contest.  Oh, really?  Sunshine...  Sunshine... 
[02:13:00]  Something thing.  Boy, they get so old.  She's like 14, maybe.  15.  Yeah.  So I honestly don't think  Kiss are a sellout.  I really mean that.  Because they've always been  like this big rock and roll band.  Gene wanted to write  a fucking rock and roll anthem.  Like, they didn't...  Kiss never pretended  to be fucking hot.  Like, you know what I mean?  They've always just been like,  yeah, we're rock stars.  We want to fucking sell  a lot of tickets  and make a lot of money  and market our band.  It's like they're very consistent.  A sellout to me  is inconsistent.  I don't know.  Jimmy makes a good point. 
[02:13:30]  No.  The definition of a sellout.  Yeah, to me,  that's not selling out.  I mean, if...  It's buying in.  Hold on.  If Kiss was selling  all this shit from day one,  then they're not...  They didn't really change  what they were all about.  Kiss would be a sellout  if they got a little backlash  from fans  about certain marketing  and then all of a sudden  stopped doing it  and started criticizing  other bands for doing it.  No, it's an acceptable sellout,  I think.  I don't think it's a sellout, though.  I would probably assume  that when Kiss first got together,  they really did want  to be appreciated 
[02:14:00]  for their music  and the ingenuity  of the time  of their stage show  and things like that.  And they became  complete parodies  and then Gene  just became a salesman  shill  using the Kiss history  and makeup  and logos  and everything else  and copywriting  the fucking money bag  with the dollar sign on.  The biggest fucking sellout.  But that's not...  But selling out to me  is like when you look back  at the old appearances  like on the Mike Douglas show 
[02:14:30]  or American Bandits  and I think they were on  like back in the mid  and early, early 70s.  They were the same guys then.  Like, they just...  It was like they've always...  They did a Paul Linn  Halloween special in 76.  Oh, ho, ho.  They didn't pretend  to be something else.  They always were  what they are.  Did Gene make a tongue joke?  Hey, Gene,  I'll do some poppers.  Put that tongue up my asshole.  I didn't like Paul Linn  because he made fun of Kiss.  I didn't get like,  why don't you go down  in your elevator shoes? 
[02:15:00]  And I didn't like that.  That made me angry.  I thought he was  making fun of Kiss.  Did you then wish him dead  and he both died?  I didn't like it, yeah.  I didn't even know  he was gay, Paul Linn.  Oh, you didn't?  No, but I'm sure  they still want to be  appreciated for the music.  It doesn't mean that  they don't want to be  appreciated for the music  because they're fucking...  Nowadays, I don't think  they give a flying fuck  about what the hell  music is coming out  of those amps.  I don't think so, man.  It's all about money  and fucking getting asses  in the seats  to fucking...  Not to entertain them,  to fucking have them  pay money.  I think Kiss 
[02:15:30]  is one of the biggest  sellout bands.  No.  We'll have to agree  that I'm right.  No, I don't agree on that.  Oh, you said okay.  I heard Jimmy said  Jimmy said okay.  Infinity can't take it back.  No backs, no backs,  no pay tax.  We got a guy...  All right, let's move  back to Gigi Allen  because we got a guy  on the line that actually...  Poor Jimmy.  You both made your points.  Stig from Wackbag.  What's up, Stig?  You new Gigi Allen?  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hi, Stig.  Or say that.  Jesus.  Yeah, I knew him  way back in the 80s.  I was in a band  in high school. 
[02:16:00]  We used to open for him  and then one of the guys  from the band  joined the Jabbers  when I went to college.  So how did he treat you  as the opening band?  Gigi was hysterically funny  back in the day.  Like back before  he shaved his head  and became a heroin addict  and stuff,  he had like more hair.  He wrote poppier,  catchier stuff.  To know him at five?  He wrote poppier...  Poppier.  Yes, he wrote fuck my face  trying to get to the top  of the billboard charts.  So was he nice to you?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he was a great guy.  He was really a lot of fun. 
[02:16:30]  Believe it or not.  Holy shit.  Considering what he became,  he was like a great guy.  Gigi's bashing himself  in the head with a microphone.  He's hanging his dick out.  He's shoving bananas  up his asshole.  How much attention  do you need?  We get it.  No one liked you.  Right, no,  but he had a scrapbook  of rejection letters  from every major label  that he had tried  to get record deals.  He shouldn't have  given one.  He was awful.  Oh, yeah, I know,  but he loved showing off 
[02:17:00]  the rejection letters.  He thought they were great.  Yeah, but he's...  That was just the way he was.  He just took a shit  on the stage.  I mean, what do you expect  the record companies to do?  A naked, weird guy.  How do you fucking  sell this shit to the people?  Well, if you guys have anything  by Gigi Allen  and the Jabbers  in the system,  it's different than  like the scum punks  and murder junkie stuff.  Okay.  All right, yeah,  we'll check it out.  Thank you, Steve.  Yeah, let's hear some of that.  Beating his head  and bleeding.  He said,  why don't you just cut it out?  Cut the malarkey, Gigi. 
[02:17:30]  He just belted.  Oh, what's he doing now?  There's something with duty,  I'm sure.  Just duty and blood.  We get it.  Duty and blood.  How taboo.  How does he make sure  he always has duty  ready to go, Jimmy?  I don't know.  He just holds in shits all day  until the show has to begin?  He just looks silly  running around with no clothes  and his little rotten penis  sticking out.  It's like, who cares?  Put shit smeared on his face.  Fucking 30 guys  in a fucking tin-walled warehouse.  Fucking nonsense.  Bunch of shit.  What?  They seem to be enjoying  the show, Jimmy. 
[02:18:00]  He just took a mouth  to his penis.  I mean, come on.  Bunch of fucking assholes.  Cut the fucking malarkey.  Put a song out  that's not idiotic.  You would never go see Gigi Allen  if he was alive?  Get shit thrown out.  I wouldn't mind if fucking,  if Sabbath kicked shit on me,  and I certainly wouldn't mind  if Paul Stanley  kicked a log in my direction,  but I don't want Gigi Allen  playing this noise  and throwing duty at me.  I guess the one thing  we ask from our band  is not to throw shit on us.  Or at least have a good song.  He's covered in shit and blood  and then he stage dives. 
[02:18:30]  Now he's throwing the mic  at the audience  and punching them in the face.  Imagine Coldplay  goes this direction.  They still have really good  pop songs,  but they insist  they have to throw duty  on their audience.  They're spitting on each other.  Just disgusting display  of nothing.  Is he considered  a genius or something?  No.  By who?  I know.  By who?  I wouldn't get it either,  but I think some people  do consider him like  this avant-garde genius man.  But he wasn't.  It was just awful  yelling and screaming  at each other.  Like it seemed like  the audience would go up 
[02:19:00]  and taunt him  and then like run away  before he can shit on you.  They treat him like  a monkey in a cage.  How do the band  remember these songs?  We're going to do  shit in a hat  for the encore.  They want to hear  piss on a baby,  but I say shit in a hat  should be the closing number.  All right,  I'll play the same.  Are you sure though?  I don't know.  Piss on a baby  does very well.  Yeah, but it's too romantic.  Steve from Bay Show  has got to go on.  He says Coldplay  does throw shit  at their audience.  It's called their music.  Oh, Steve from Bay Shore. 
[02:19:30]  Jimmy, what?  One I could read.  You know,  every band has that one song  where you got to pull out  your lighter, man.  Or nowadays,  it's your phone.  Exactly.  What would the G.G. Allen  lighter song be?  Dynamite cunt.  Look at him  trying to be all  profound.  Now I'm going to die.  Stuck it up my ass.  Guys,  we found a band  that never sold out.  You want to find out  who it is?  G.G. Allen.  G.G. Allen,  a murder jockey. 
[02:20:00]  Dave in Maryland  got the band  that never sold out,  my friends.  Dave?  Hey,  what's going on,  guys?  What's up?  Yeah,  Steely Dan.  One of the greatest  bands ever.  Never had to advertise.  Their music spoke for him.  Steely Dan  fucking stinks.  That's why I don't call it.  You don't like  Steely Dan?  No.  What's wrong with  Steely Dan, Jimmy?  They're fucking horrendous.  Why?  Play me a Steely Dan song.  Well, which one?  I don't know.  Which one should we play  for Jimmy there, Dave? 
[02:20:30]  K19?  No.  Let me see.  Time Out of Mind.  All right,  stay on the line, Dave.  We'll play Time Out of Mind  by the...  What's he doing?  Sucking shit out  of someone's ass.  He's a picture of  G.G. Allen sucking  shit off a plate.  He's like,  I don't mind if you do that,  but don't call it your show.  Do that in the backstage.  Don't make us pay  to watch that.  I'm not a fucking jerk.  He really bothers.  Because I'm a performer.  I get it.  I know what it is. 
[02:21:00]  Fucking...  You're Steely Dan, Jimmy.  Enjoy.  They never sold out.  Turn this up.  That's a little jazz fusion.  Fucking awful.  I call it a little jazz fusion.  Is this a deep cut?  Yeah, it sure is.  I had to play a lot  of Steely Dan over the years.  I never played this one.  Not even on the  deep cut weekend.  This is fucking boring.  Could you play a song?  Oh, what's a song  that's really popular?  Yeah, play a popular one.  Reeling in the years.  I know that one.  I didn't reel it in the years. 
[02:21:30]  Black Friday.  What's that one?  Hey, 19.  Do It Again.  They're just bores.  They sound like  the Doobie Brothers  or the Eagles.  They're just fucking  boring white guys  with fucking  Michael McDonald beards.  That's what they remind me of.  I didn't mind Steely Dan.  I didn't mind him.  What's the name of that album?  Oh, Deacon Blues.  Thank you, Redding.  Yeah, Deacon Blues is a good song.  We're looking at a Gigi Allen  fucking picture.  Is that an album cover?  No, it's an old gig poster. 
[02:22:00]  Two Steely Dan members  went to the Doobie Brothers.  Is that true?  Probably.  That's what Denver Pest is saying.  Tom Ladd from Chicago  sums up Steely Dan.  Steely Dan equals  self-indulgent  eight-hour guitar tuning.  Yeah.  What are the names  of some of the fucking  Gigi Allen's albums?  Well, they're all...  Yeah.  He's turned down  by major labels.  Of course you are.  You're fucking terrible.  This is all right.  It's not a terrible song.  Oh, Peg. 
[02:22:30]  Thank you, David F.  I stand corrected.  It's awful.  That fucking  70s melodic  harmonizing  fucking fruit.  What was the 70s?  What were they supposed to do?  Fleetwood Mac.  All that shite.  What were they supposed to do?  Did they start playing grunge?  How about that?  Did fucking Sabbath harmonize?  You think your fucking Tony  put his fucking  three-fingered hand  into the fucking mic  and toodaloo in there?  Toodaloo.  While Ozzy was  fucking belting out of tune?  Ozzy, a little bit  of a sellout, Jimmy.  Never.  When everyone else  started putting hairspray  in their fucking hair.  Ozzy jumped right on 
[02:23:00]  that fucking train  for a while.  Baby shampoo  with no more tears.  Selling out  does not mean  fucking adapting  to the times  is not selling out.  Just a little bit.  Selling out is not...  Adjusting  with the times  is not selling out  because he fucking  survived grunge, dude.  And he's still relevant  fucking all those years later.  Hold on.  World of Warcraft commercial.  Sell out.  Dude, I don't...  Not at all.  What's that sprint commercial  he did last year?  Oh my god.  You mean Ozzy's doing  a commercial?  How terrible?  Why shouldn't he?  Hey, pay me a fucking  million bucks 
[02:23:30]  to sell your shit phones?  Because he's the  Prince of Darkness, Jimmy.  That's exactly  the beauty of it.  He's not.  He's a guy who can't  use the remote.  That's the beauty of him.  We don't want to know that.  We want to think of him  as the Prince of Darkness.  That's the guy I like.  You see, when I see  Ozzy fucking shirtless  going,  that's the dude  I fucking like.  Is there anything worse  than your favorite band  adapting to the times?  No.  No, there's nothing  wrong with it.  No, it's really bad.  We all have our favorite band  and you go,  why are you doing  a fucking rap song?  When Rush rapped. 
[02:24:00]  Rush, Roll the Bones.  Yeah, but there's  other examples.  All of a sudden  you want your band  to stay true to themselves  and they're like,  no, this is happening now  so we gotta do  a little something different.  Ozzy doing  Shot in the Dark  was not selling out.  Ozzy doing  The Ultimate Sin  where he kind of got involved  in the nuclear  fucking message.  A lot of people did  in the early 80s.  I don't mind if you're  thinking about what's going on  in the time period  but I mean,  adjusting to what's hot  in music  always was an embarrassment. 
[02:24:30]  You want to hear  Roll the Bones?  You want to hear  this Rush fucking rap  coming up?  I like a good...  This could be  the biggest douche chill  in music history  right here.  Is it?  I don't even know anymore.  I don't know.  Is this Roll the Bones?  Oh, it is?  Turn up a little bit.  Listen to this rap.  It's Rush.  I loved Rush  growing up.  What year?  I don't know, Jimmy.  I'd have to say what?  Mid 80s?  And this song 
[02:25:00]  wasn't bad for the time.  It really wasn't that bad.  And then they fucked it up  with this rap  that's coming up.  That's the way  that Lady Dark dances.  Roll the Bones.  Roll the Bones.  Come on.  Start rapping.  Why are we here?  We don't even know  where the rap is.  Because we're here.  Roll the Bones.  And Rush isn't in the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  still?  Disgusting.  It's ridiculous.  LL Cool J might be.  Yeah, I know.  Kiss finally got nominated. 
[02:25:30]  Boo!  No, they deserve it.  I'll defend Kiss.  Even though I know  Dan has a reason.  You will defend Kiss  to the bitter end.  Musically, I will, yes.  I love them.  I think he's working  into the rap part.  Long way to go  to hear the rap.  Oh, come on.  By the way.  By the way,  a little info  on Steely Dan.  I can't get to you  right now, John,  in Michigan.  Steely Dan got their  name from a dildo.  Yes.  A Steely Dan.  A Steely Dan, right.  Bruce Springsteen,  the E Street Band,  never sold out. 
[02:26:00]  Bruce!  Back to my morning poop.  That was from Roland.  He texted me.  Let me think.  Come on, Bruce.  Bruce sold out huge.  Yeah, he stayed true  to himself.  Youngstown's a good song.  It's more about  staying true to yourself.  What, working man  fucking?  Yeah.  Even though he lives  in a mansion,  he's got houses  all over the world,  but, you know.  I'm a sellout.  What was he supposed  to do with his money?  I sold out?  Fuck you.  I want to actually  talk to this guy.  I'll admit it.  Come on, where's  the fucking rap? 
[02:26:30]  Where's the rap?  We don't want to  sit through  fucking Rush song.  I'd rather hear  my computer.  You can hear this  on classic vinyl.  Oh, God.  Let's get to it.  Back to the fucking chorus.  We'll get to it later.  Jimmy, we've got to  take a break before that.  We do?  Yeah, we've been  talking for an hour.  All right, there's a guy  in the hold.  No, let's just tell him  because I want to  talk to this guy, man.  Yeah, Matt from  RottenTomatoes.com,  a website we like.  He's on the line  to talk about his website  and what, the worst  movies of all time?  Yeah, Matt, we're  going to take a quick  break because we all 
[02:27:00]  have to piss, but they're  doing a Rotten Tomatoes  list, apparently, top  hundred worst movies  of all time, and you  had to be really low  rated on Rotten  Tomatoes.  Yeah.  There were certain ones  that didn't make the  list because they didn't  rank low enough.  They weren't actually  low enough.  It's pretty accurate,  man.  Usually, because you're  getting it from all  parts of the country,  it's a pretty accurate  read on if a movie's  good or not.  Wow, but the  problem with this list,  we don't know any of  these movies.  What?  Oh, yeah, I know a lot  of them.  I don't know shit. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, here it is.  Turn it up.  Yeah, this is just like  Tom Sawyer.  You're going to kick  some gluteus max.  No way.  He didn't do it.  He said it.  Is this them or  someone else rapping?  I don't know.  Kick some gluteus max.  It was one of the  dudes.  All right.  There you go.  Now I got to go to the  bathroom and vomit. 
[02:28:00]  And people mentioned  The Dead and Fish and  ACDC and Fugazi.  A lot of bands being  How dare they put this  movie in here?  How dare you?  Let's get to the Rotten  Tomatoes list right after  the break.  Matt, hang in there on  the line there.  We'll get to you.  I hope you and Anthony.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I love how I get  attacked. 
[02:28:30]  This dopey hater.  Listening on a delay,  just wanted to say,  Opie, you're musically  a fucking retard.  You know nothing about  music.  Okay.  And Jimmy and Anthony  were just brilliant with  their fucking  audits.  Thank you.  Isn't that great?  Shut the fuck up.  Music is so subjective.  You can say the show  didn't know what the  fuck they were talking  about.  Music is such a  subjective thing.  It's like, why?  So what are you going  to say?  Right.  They don't know anything  about music.  They suck.  What?  I'm confident in what  I know.  What are you,  a Gigi Allen fan? 
[02:29:00]  Oh, that's probably it.  We hit one of his  bands.  Yeah.  Look, I'm a Kurt Cobain  fan.  I would imagine he's  going after the whole  thought on Kurt Cobain.  Yeah.  The guy was a sellout.  He was doing interviews  right up until he  fucking swallowed the  shotgun.  And I like Nirvana.  And I love that unplugged.  The last thing he did  was unplugged.  That was pretty fucking  corporate and selling  out, my friend.  Yeah.  It was the hottest show  on TV at the time.  Huge.  So if he didn't like  the fame man and the 
[02:29:30]  attention man, all he  had to do was just  disappear.  He did.  No, I know.  But for real.  Instead of continuing  to do interviews before  he killed himself.  No, the killing of  himself had nothing to  do with him selling out  and not liking fame.  That was some demon  shit that finally got  to him.  It was an absolutely  different thing.  Let's say hi to Matt  from RottenTomatoes.com.  Matt.  Matt.  What up, Matt?  Thanks for having me,  guys.  Hey, man.  How are you?  Sorry for the wait. 
[02:30:00]  Matt, I don't know how  to say your last name.  It's Achity.  Achity.  It sounds like a sneeze  or something.  Matt, Achity.  Did you create Rotten  Tomatoes?  I wish that I did, but  no, I've only been with  him for a couple years.  Oh, you're the editor-in-chief.  Okay.  Yeah.  So you guys are  putting out this list.  It's 100 worst films in  the last 10 years.  Yes.  As judged on your  website.  As judged on our  website.  As what we run on our  site, we call the  tomato meter, which is  a measure of what the  critics are saying about  every particular movie. 
[02:30:30]  Now, is it only critics  or regular people?  It's only critics in the  main tomato meter,  although regular people  can rate movies on the  site.  Right.  And we do run a  separate number for what  users say.  You know, Matt, we've got  to tell you right off the  bat, we're huge fans of  RottenTomatoes.com.  Oh, that's great to hear.  Because, you know, when you  get your local newspaper,  some dopey-ass movie reviewer,  you know, it might not be his  cup of tea, so he gives it  one star.  And then, like, the competing  paper gives it four stars.  Yeah.  So what you guys do is you bring 
[02:31:00]  all the reviews from all the  major newspapers across America,  and then you get a much better  idea if the movie's going to  suck or not.  Yeah, we do, you know,  that's the whole thing.  We spend most of our time just  reading reviews all day, and  especially towards the end of  the week, that's when it gets  really busy.  And, you know, it's great to  have a consensus.  I'll tell you, it really helps  dictate what I go and see.  Now, can you, this, the rating  is from, what, zero to 100?  From zero to 100, yeah.  Zero to 100.  So it is simply a percentage of 
[02:31:30]  how many critics recommend a  particular film.  Right.  Now, I'm looking at this list  here of the worst movies in the  past decade.  Yeah, there's some dudes in  there.  And the highest rating at number  100 is a seven?  Yeah, a seven.  Now that, okay, so, like, a  movie that gets a 20 is, like,  a bad movie.  Yeah.  So these are incredibly bad  movies.  Yeah, these are some real dogs. 
[02:32:00]  Some real bad, you know, I  mean, the most recent, well,  number 100 is the most recent  film on the list, too, is  Whiteout.  Whiteout.  It's a Beckinsale movie, and  I'm here to tell you, that's a  bad movie.  But she's really hot.  She is great, but she has  got her boobies taken care of,  so now they're a little bigger.  Who wants to see her in snow  gear all week?  What's that, what, is that  about a fucking, a white snow  squall?  Who gives a shit?  Yeah.  Who wants to watch a movie  about a snowstorm?  Oh, my God, I forgot my  goggles!  Fuck you.  Yeah, I'm perusing the list 
[02:32:30]  here, just trying to see if  there's anything I disagree  with, like, really look at and  just go, well, I thought that  was kind of good.  And before you change the page,  Larry the Cable Guy, health  inspector?  Oh, God.  Was that a sequel to Larry the  Cable Guy?  No, that was his first movie.  That was his first movie.  He's got to have Larry the Cable  Guy in the title.  He can work him into the title.  Yeah.  He's got Delta Farce, he's got  that.  Witless Protection in the top 
[02:33:00]  ten.  I'm sure they're not great  movies, but I do think that the  critics are going to attack it  just because it's Larry the  Cable Guy and they're not going  to like his humor, although I'm  sure that they're not great  movies.  I'm sure the movie stunk on  ice.  Can I just stop the interview?  Yeah.  You can't let me slide.  I'm looking at Larry the Cable  Guy and I'm thinking the fucking  Jim Carrey Cable fucking  guy.  We didn't know that.  Oh, no!  I have an uncomfortable  feeling to have my entire body.  You can't let that slide.  I'm like, is Larry the Cable  Guy help us back through the 
[02:33:30]  sequel to Cable Guy?  Oh, I didn't even catch that!  Oh, I thought you said to  Larry the Cable Guy.  I am so uncomfortable, I just  want to leave.  Who cares if you humiliated  yourself?  I didn't even notice it.  I'm humiliated.  Thank God you guys aren't good  listeners.  No, I heard you.  I'm sweating.  I thought you meant a  Larry the Cable Guy.  Wow.  I'm fucking sweating.  Larry the Cable Guy.  Right.  Now, I don't agree with this  one.  How did Christmas with the  Cranks make the list?  I know.  That's a fun for the family  movie. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  Well, there are a few of  those movies.  I'm kidding you.  I'm sure it's shit.  It's fucking horrible.  Yeah, there are the ones that  you just know, like Glitter.  Yeah.  That movie was...  I'll tell you guys, the one,  and I was talking to Steve  about this yesterday, the one  that I was shocked to see didn't  make the list because it was  at 10% was Catwoman.  Catwoman.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Somehow Catwoman made it off  the list.  Yeah, I thought that stunk.  How about Pink Panther 2?  Was that close to making the  list?  I think they got 20. 
[02:34:30]  No, it wasn't bad enough.  What did it get?  Pink Panther 2 is in the 20s.  I don't know if that happened.  That's a fucking heap of shit.  Yeah.  We just fucking...  Wow, and...  88 minutes, guys.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what I'm looking.  You see that 88 minutes?  Pacino.  There was two Pacino movies.  What was the other one?  The other Pacino movie was  Geely.  Geely?  What is that?  Geely.  Geely.  That was the legendary Ben Affleck.  Ben Affleck, yeah.  Jennifer Aniston. 
[02:35:00]  J-Lo movie.  Yeah, J-Lo.  What was that?  Oh, he was in that Pacino?  Yeah.  Yeah, with my lips.  With my lips.  That was directed by Martin Brest,  who directed Midnight Run.  Oh, God.  He hasn't worked since then.  How about...  What were De Niro's movies?  De Niro had two in the top 100, too.  De Niro had Godsend,  which was this terrible thriller  about some evil baby kid thing 
[02:35:30]  that was also Rebecca Romijn.  And then he was also in  Bridge Over San Luis Rey.  What the fuck is that?  It's a remake,  and it's a terrible, terrible film.  It's a remake of the old movie,  and it's just one of those movies  where everything went wrong.  I mean, F. Murray Abraham's in that,  Kathy Bates is in it,  Gabriel Byrne is in it.  Some wannabe epic,  and it's just a disaster.  That sounds funny to watch, actually.  Well, now, I got a problem with your list, 
[02:36:00]  because No. 18 was a terrific movie.  That was the Dana Carvey movie, right?  I love that fucking thing.  The Master of the Sky.  Oh, that was just a terrific movie.  Oh, did that look so...  I used to run for the remote  when the commercial would come on for that.  I'd have to shut it off.  I don't disagree with one movie on this list.  I haven't seen most of them.  But just by seeing the trailers  and the television little ads for it,  Battlefield Earth, of course,  made that one, No. 27, really bad. 
[02:36:30]  Meet the Spartans.  Oh, God, when they just try to pump out a parody  of a popular movie.  Those guys have four movies on the list.  Do they, really?  Yeah, they have Meet the Spartans,  they have Epic Movie,  they have Disaster Movie,  and they have Date Movie.  Who are these people?  Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer.  Those are the only movies they've directed.  They're all on the worst list?  Yeah.  I got to go to Instant Feedback.  Redding from Wack Bag. 
[02:37:00]  Hey, Opie, was Son of Mask,  the sequel to Mask with Rocky Dennis?  Rocky Dennis.  See, we could have fun with my faux pas.  Yes.  Sucking ass.  What was...  It says that Jon Voight was in one of them.  What was his?  Jon Voight.  Oh, you guys will love this one.  He was in Super Baby's Baby Geniuses 2.  Oh, wow.  Baby Geniuses 2.  That was great,  where they just superimposed  the baby's mouths moving  and made them evil geniuses. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  A wonderful, wonderful movie.  Yeah, that was directed by Bob Clark,  who directed A Christmas Story.  Should we go through  the top ten worst movies  of the last ten years,  and you can give us a little tidbit  if something pops in your head?  Sure.  Because I don't know any of these.  I didn't see any of these.  How do you not know number ten?  Number ten.  We did our research,  and really, believe it or not,  these all made it into theaters.  Yeah.  All right.  It got zero on the tomato meter.  A movie called Witless Protection.  Yeah, that's... 
[02:38:00]  Larry the Cable Guy.  Larry the Cable Guy.  See, I don't know.  See, instead of  Witless Protection Program,  it's Witless Protection.  Get it?  Oh, I got that.  The title's funny enough.  And then...  That was the only thing  that was funny.  Yeah.  Number nine, Red Line.  Red Line was the  Eddie Griffin movie  where he wrecked that Ferrari.  Yeah, I remember  he wrecked the Ferrari  during the little  publicity stunt thing  they did.  Yeah, that was the little...  Why was that movie bad?  It was just a terrible movie. 
[02:38:30]  It was a...  It was a...  Get that...  We've read that it's a  dumb version of  the Fast and Furious movies.  Oh, Jesus.  By the way,  I want to see  those two De Niro movies.  Pacino and De Niro  are both...  Both of them  have been doing movies  that are bad,  but their acting  has been fucking terrible.  I haven't seen...  When's the last time  you saw Pacino or De Niro  give a good acting performance?  Really bad.  Yeah, you know,  it's unfortunate to see  and the other shocking thing  was that Righteous Kill  didn't make it the list. 
[02:39:00]  Righteous Kill.  All right, number...  Continued success.  Number eight, actually.  A movie called  Three Strikes.  Three Strikes, yeah.  DJ Poo,  who directed Friday.  Mmm.  Which is a funny movie,  but this one's not so good.  This one's not funny.  What's it about,  Three Strikes?  Three Strikes,  it's about a guy  who's looking at his  third conviction  and life in prison.  That's a hotbed for comedy.  Personally,  what do you think 
[02:39:30]  of these goddamn  Madea movies?  You know,  I'm not a big fan  of the Madea movies.  Yeah, thank you.  Not a big fan.  Neither am I.  I wish one of them  would have made it  on the screen.  Yeah, but the one where  he does that thing...  I love...  Oh, he's so funny.  You know, the one where he...  Tyler Perry dresses  like a woman  and goes to prison.  Yeah, like that.  Oh, it's hysterical.  But you know,  his movies make money.  Oh, no shit.  It's amazing  how much money.  And actually,  I gotta tell you,  his tomato meter scores  are getting better. 
[02:40:00]  His scores on the movies.  You know,  the last one,  I Can Do Bad All By Myself,  actually was his first  fresh rated movie.  Wow.  Hey, Anthony,  I gotta go back  to the instant feedback.  I'm trying to develop  a bit on my own here.  Stephen S. from Bayshore writes,  Hey, Ope,  was Eight Men Out  a sequel to  The Magnificent Seven?  Where are we at?  Strange Wilderness,  number seven.  Strange Wilderness, yeah.  That was the Steve Zahn,  Jonah Hill,  camping movie.  Right.  Oh. 
[02:40:30]  Those camping movies.  Gary Hamlin shows up in it.  How...  Why isn't  that stupid river movie...  Oh, yeah,  that stupid movie  with the...  The River Runs Fruish?  No, no, no.  Where they all went camping  and Dummy was in it  that we...  No, we like him.  No, I'm kidding.  Up a creek without a paddle,  whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  Up a creek without a paddle  or something.  Who's in that?  Up the creek.  Yeah, that wasn't bad enough,  actually.  Oh, God,  how could that not be bad enough? 
[02:41:00]  All right,  Super Babies,  Baby Geniuses 2.  Super Babies.  Yeah, that's hard.  Number six on the list.  Worst movies I've all told.  Baby Geniuses.  You know,  we've been talking around,  I remember as we were looking  at this list,  we were talking about how,  you know,  you figure that Angelina Jolie  and Jon Voight are still fighting  and we wonder if she busts out.  Like, listen, Dad,  I can't trust you  because you were in Super Babies 2.  Yeah.  Well, if you notice,  a couple of these,  2004 to 2008  was really bad,  hunky years.  2002 was bad.  I wonder if there was  a bunch of bad years in a row  because fucking, 
[02:41:30]  there was a writer's strike  and they knew it was coming  so they were all just  throwing out movies  that could be released  during this strike  which they did not know  how long it was going to be  or did that not affect the movies?  It did affect the movies.  No, I think that there's  definitely a part of that.  I think that that's part of why  we saw a bunch of remakes  and such too.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Horrible.  Um, and Awful Me  from Whackbag writes,  Hey Ope,  uh, was Bridges of Madison County  the sequel to  Bridge of the River Kwai?  Over the River Kwai?  Right.  Uh, I don't think so.  Um, National Lampoon's 
[02:42:00]  Gold Diggers,  number five,  worst movie  of the last ten years.  I think at this point  we gotta admit that  National Lampoon movies  in general  suck a dick.  They're terrible.  There's only been a few  that have been really good.  Most of them  are just not worth  watching.  Everything since Animal Hill,  Animal House  has been  Yeah.  Terrible.  Yeah.  Uh, King's Ransom.  Vacation was okay.  Yeah, there's a few  that were really,  uh, Vacation was more  than okay.  That was a really good movie.  Sorry.  Don't need to embarrass me.  Sorry.  Who was in King's Ransom? 
[02:42:30]  King's Ransom is  Anthony Anderson  and Jay Moore.  Oh, shit.  Anthony Anderson is a businessman  who gets taken hostage,  held for ransom.  Right, okay,  I remember that.  Terrible movie.  Yeah, wow.  I do remember that.  Yeah, Jay Moore was in that.  Pinocchio.  Pinocchio.  Aw.  Now, this isn't the original  Pinocchio, obviously.  This is the...  Aw.  This was his follow-up  to Life is Beautiful  after he won the Oscar.  Roberto Benigni?  He's going to do his,  his, his Pinocchio movie 
[02:43:00]  where he starred as Pinocchio.  Wasn't he getting his nose  stuck in everyone's hineys  in this, uh, version?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Sounds awful.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, it's a terrible,  terrible movie.  What happened?  I was trying to make a joke.  How did Pinocchio  make the list?  Pinocchio's big nose  and feet.  Aw.  Aw.  I was so flat  because the guy  answered it like  it was a real question.  Yeah.  Uh, let's see.  Number two.  The runner-up.  Worst movie  of the last ten years.  Aw.  A movie called 
[02:43:30]  One Missed Call.  One Missed Call  with Shannon Sossaman  and Edward Burns.  That was the movie  with the poster  with the mouth  for the eyes.  The poster of the face  that had like,  instead of eyes  it was mouths and...  Oh, who remembers?  Wow, that is really...  Terrible, terrible movie.  Okay, I'm looking  at the poster now.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it was kind of  a bad version  of When a Stranger Calls.  It's...  The tagline is  What will it sound like  when you die?  Ugh.  Anthony, can I break in here? 
[02:44:00]  Because English Jen  from the UK writes  Uh, hey, Ope.  Was the bucket list  a sequel to  Schindler's List?  No, I don't think...  I don't think so.  Uh, and number one...  Very clever.  Very clever.  I actually saw this one.  You did?  Yeah.  Okay.  It was terrible.  What is it?  Wasn't Antonia Banderas  in this?  Yes, and Lucy Liu.  And Lucy Liu.  In Ballistic,  X vs. Sever.  Yeah.  Horrible movie.  Yeah, it's... 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  Is it a slasher film?  No, it's...  An action movie.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  A lot of people think  it was based on a video game  and it actually wasn't.  The video game  was based on the movie.  It was one of those things  that were supposed to be out  at the same time.  But the movie was delayed  for almost two years.  It was so incredibly bad.  Um, I don't know why  I didn't just get up  and get the fuck out.  But, um...  Yeah.  Bad.  Zero.  It got zero  out of 107 reviews.  Yeah.  It got zero.  Not one person liked it? 
[02:45:00]  No.  Nobody liked it.  No one liked it.  That's unbelievable.  Nobody liked it.  It was like garbage.  Yeah.  Um...  Hmm.  Damn.  All right.  Hey, uh, what movies  do you like coming out?  Uh, what do I like coming out?  Actually, you know,  we've got a great week  for movies coming out  this week.  Uh, well,  so if you're a 3D fan,  uh, both of the  Toy Story movies  are back in theaters.  Um, but we've got  early tomato meters  on a bunch of stuff.  Zombieland...  Wait, wait, wait.  I want to slow you down.  So Toy Story, 
[02:45:30]  it's the movies we've all seen,  but now it's in 3D.  They're in 3D.  Do they give you  a little extra  of anything else  just to kind of  pump it up besides the 3D?  Uh, not that I've heard.  It's just 3D.  Do they clean up  the film a little bit too?  Make it, uh, more crisp?  Uh, they may have.  Yeah.  They may have.  Would you go to the theater  to see 3D Toy Story yet?  No, why should I bother?  Make a new fucking Toy Story.  They are.  All right.  Yeah.  I'll wait.  Toy Story 3 will be out, uh,  next year.  Okay, cool.  Oh.  And, uh, yeah, continue.  Zombieland is currently  at 100%.  Yes. 
[02:46:00]  I want to see Zombieland.  What is Zombieland about?  Zombieland is a zombie movie  with, uh, Woody Harrelson,  uh, and we're hearing  great things about it.  I've known a couple people  who've seen it already  and they say it's hilarious.  And the girl from  Little Miss Sunshine.  Uh, yes, uh,  she's in that.  We just saw her  on an interview  and she got, like, older.  Uh, Lee Winters asks.  Don't do that  unless they die.  Lee Winters asks  from Atlanta,  Opie, was Body Heat  the sequel to  Saturday Night Fever? 
[02:46:30]  They are ragging you.  Uh, what else there, sir?  Uh, Whip It.  Whip It.  Whip It, which is  the, uh, roller derby movie.  Oh, right, right, right.  Oh, yeah.  It's from Juno  and it's Drew Barrymore's  first, uh, movie as a director.  Uh, that looks horrendous.  Uh-oh.  Uh, it's only 82%.  It is.  Okay.  All right.  So, it looks like  it could be pretty good.  Holden Steady  and you're 82%.  Yeah.  Uh, then, what else  is opening this week? 
[02:47:00]  Uh, The Invention of Lying,  which is, uh, 86%.  Invention of Lying?  What is that?  That's Ricky Gervais.  Yeah, Gervais is in that.  Oh, Louis C.K.  Oh, Louis C.K. is in that.  I'd like to see that.  Did you see that movie yet?  Uh, I haven't seen it yet.  I heard.  Uh, somebody I work with  has seen it  and they loved it.  Oh, great.  I can't wait to see that.  Yeah, you guys know  the premise of that one, right?  That's the one where  it's a world where  nobody lies  and Ricky Gervais  basically figures out  how to lie  and the world  is his oyster.  Mm, that sounds interesting  and Gervais is very funny. 
[02:47:30]  Yes, he is.  I give it, um, 85.  That's right.  I give it four apples.  Rotten tomatoes.  Well, you guys have  a great sight, man.  Yeah, absolutely.  Thank you very much.  We go to it all the time.  Um, it's a great place  to see what's going on  with the, with these movies  and what the reviews are  for these movies.  Oh, this jibba jabba.  Sure.  What about Obama's presidency?  Where is that sitting  on Rotten Tomatoes?  We haven't, we haven't been reading  what the critics  have been saying about that.  No? 
[02:48:00]  Okay, can I add in?  Oh, Jimmy.  What happened?  Hey, Gav.  No.  He had some other type  of produce.  Oh, my God.  Instead of Rotten Tomatoes,  he chose another type  of produce.  No, you can't do that.  It's terrible.  Not in this day and age.  Yeah.  Well, uh, thank you very much.  Very concise list  you got there  of the hundred worst movies  over the past decade.  I agree with it  wholeheartedly.  Oh, well, you know,  they are fun to watch 
[02:48:30]  if you have a few beers.  Yeah, bad movies are,  I love a good bad movie  every so often.  What is the best bad movie  you've ever seen?  Roadhouse.  Oh, that's a,  look at you  with the quick answer.  Roadhouse is a great,  horrible movie.  A great, horrible movie.  The guy's on the,  on the bouncer circuit.  There is no bouncer circuit.  They don't know him.  He comes in,  it's like,  oh, it's Dalton.  Look out.  Horrible movie.  Matt, what was your,  uh, favorite bad movie?  My favorite bad movie,  without hesitation,  is Fifth Element. 
[02:49:00]  No, it's not a bad movie.  Oh, Danny.  Holy shit.  It's not a bad movie.  Look out.  That's a great movie.  It's a great sci-fi flick.  It's a great movie.  It's a great action.  The plot's a mess.  That movie's a mess.  Not really.  I mean,  it might be,  it might be hard to follow  first viewing,  but I mean,  uh,  there's definitely a plot  and it's definitely followable.  Yeah,  but you know,  you watch that movie  and you're thinking,  oh,  a 14-year-old boy  came up with this plot.  I'm not saying  that that's awful.  It's,  it's a,  it's a great flick.  There's great action in it.  I mean,  Bruce Willis,  it's a good action movie for him.  It's a good vehicle for Willis. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah,  he is,  he is obnoxious,  but I mean,  that's the character  that he's playing.  Tiny Lister  is the president of the galaxy.  Yeah,  that's kind of weird.  So what though?  But that's like  such a minuscule role.  No one's focusing  on Tiny Lister  and his character  and the role,  his role in the film.  A black president.  Plus it's a gorgeous film.  I mean,  if you've seen it,  the Blu-ray copy,  it's absolutely gorgeous.  A what?  Yeah,  I don't like gorgeous  in my film view.  It's a gorgeous film.  It looks unbelievable.  Gorgeous.  It looks unbelievable.  Gorgeous.  Going into film reviewing. 
[02:50:00]  But yeah,  but don't,  and you're not a gentleman,  Danny.  That's something  a man with fucking  patches on his sleeve says.  I'm sorry.  It looks fucking awesome.  Yeah,  we like that.  You're the type of man  who falls asleep  with a lit cigarette  in a karaoke machine.  You're fucking drooling.  You have a cigarette  in your mouth  and your face  is against the machine  as it's blaring music.  Jimmy makes a good point.  It's a gorgeous film.  You're the  co-fucking-king king guy.  You shouldn't be saying gorgeous.  You should say visually  it looks good.  It's a gorgeous film. 
[02:50:30]  It pleases me.  It was gorgeousness  and gorgeosity made flesh.  I'd like to throw  fucking hot coffee on you.  Mila Jovovich is fucking hot.  Exactly.  Yeah,  there you go.  You can see your tits.  Yeah,  that's what we like here.  It's a gorgeous movie.  You got your cup of coffee.  You're judging gorgeousness.  Oh,  Jesus.  Yeah.  I think Matt has had enough of us.  Thank you,  Matt.  It's a great site,  man.  Can we call you from time to time 
[02:51:00]  when these movies are...  Oh,  absolutely.  When the good movies are...  Yeah,  we'll talk dirty.  Jesus.  I know.  We completely fell off.  We'll pull our penises out  and try to get something done,  you know?  Tickle our hugs.  Can the man leave  with a little respect?  I'm sorry.  Come on now.  All right.  Matt,  you're going to like us.  I know it sounds weird now,  but you're going to like us eventually.  For your first call,  you did pretty good.  Oh,  thank you very much.  You guys were very kind.  You were very gentle with me.  All right,  good.  Matt,  thank you.  Thank you,  RottenTomatoes.com.  Bye,  Matt.  Bye,  thanks.  Now beat it. 
[02:51:30]  Now scram.  Scram.  No,  I didn't think the Terminal  was the sequel to Philadelphia.  Oh.  That's just downright mean.  And no,  Ghostbusters was not the sequel  to Ghost.  Stop.  Stop already.  Chris Tucker yelling  in the fifth element.  Nah,  he likes to yell  that movie.  It was so fucking annoying.  Well,  I'm not saying that he wasn't annoying.  He definitely was obnoxious.  Nails on a chalkboard.  That was his voice. 
[02:52:00]  Got him.  Got him.  Got him.  Got him.  Shut up.  Where's Dana White?  Well,  speaking of that,  Jimmy,  could you intro  the fact that  we got a tweet?  What do you got for that?  You know how you intro stuff  when we're breaking news  and things like that?  We need some kind of intro  when we're going to read  a special tweet.  Attention,  folks,  tweet  coming.  I love it. 
[02:52:30]  You like that one?  Yeah,  that's perfect.  Attention,  folks,  tweet  coming.  We got a tweet  from Dana White  UFC  is his Twitter name.  And if I read this,  they'll be just  hell to pay.  So is there anyone around here  that we don't give a shit about?  What can I do with  E-Rock?  Yes. 
[02:53:00]  Why?  Will it be hell to play?  Because  when it comes from us  then there's problems.  Can I see it?  I'll read it.  Oh,  well,  no,  I can see it right there.  Yeah.  Who wants to read this?  Let's get,  yeah,  we don't care about Sam.  Sam,  can you read this tweet  for us,  please?  This is Dana White  UFC  wrote this,  I don't know,  about 30 minutes ago.  Did he write it,  though?  Oh,  I see.  You see it?  Yeah,  it's right there on his,  It's a verified account.  It is a verified account.  They verify the accounts  of celebrities now.  Oh, 
[02:53:30]  why isn't mine verified?  I'm quite the big celebrity.  You have to contact Twitter.  I gotta be honest with you.  Shouldn't someone do that for me?  I'm thinking about  getting on this Twitter.  You're already on Twitter.  That's not me.  What?  Nope.  Sam,  you should probably get on it.  I haven't seen one of your posts.  That's because you stopped  following me  because you said  all I did was talk about  hip-hop and wrestling.  Oh,  so if I followed you  there'd be something different  than hip-hop or wrestling?  I think so.  Punch up,  can we punch up  Sam's Twitter account  for a second?  Because I really would like to see  what, 
[02:54:00]  what does he talk about it?  You're saying?  Yeah,  let's see.  Wrestling and what?  Let's see what the first thing is.  Oh my God,  how could I forget  the genius of Mr. McMahon's  life sucks  and then you die speech?  And then the next one,  watching Best of Smackdown.  You go out there  and win one for the  micker.  Who the hell's the micker?  Misspelled something.  No,  that's correct.  And then what local  morning show  do you want to be part of  Jocktober this year?  Oh,  thank you.  Well,  that's good.  It's about time you work  for the show  after hours. 
[02:54:30]  I've been watching  Pawn Stars  for three hours.  Okay,  that's good.  Continuing with,  look,  now,  Men on a Mission  is wrestlers.  Wrestlers,  okay,  some more wrestling.  I think I'm heading down  to PA for  Signamania tomorrow.  Sina.  Signamania.  Signamania.  I have no idea  what the fuck that is.  That's a wrestling convention?  Uh-huh,  and then you plug  the old,  the Ron and Fezza  gig that they did? 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  JAPW Worldwide  Episode 1  is online.  What is that?  That would be  Jersey All Pro Wrestling.  All right.  It's just because  my play-by-play  is on.  Look,  every fucking  one of your posts.  Enough already.  Oh,  wow,  let me see.  WWE offering  10 million  to Kanye West.  True?  I don't think so.  El Super Bisto  on DVD.  What is that?  That's Rob Zombie's  animated feature.  Oh,  okay,  Rob Zombie. 
[02:55:30]  What fucking  horrible tweets?  Sam has  the worst tweets.  They're an eclectic  Twitter.  You know who's handsome?  At Anthony Cumia.  That was the day  I dropped him.  Yes.  And he thought  he'd pick me back up  by having a compliment.  He's trying to get you back.  Will you just start  following him for a little bit?  Not Sam on Twitter,  please.  I understand.  Do the kid a favor.  A lot of my Twitters,  a lot of my tweets,  whatever you want to call them,  not everyone's going to be  interested.  I know that.  I am.  I like your tweets. 
[02:56:00]  That's what Twitter's all about.  You can't hit the masses  with something interesting.  You are just boring.  You got to check it  because I got the  Best of Smackdown DVD set.  That was why those  Smackdown quotes  were there yesterday.  Best of Smackdown.  I can't do  Planet of the Apes  sequel jokes.  I'm sorry.  I just can't do that.  Wait,  wait,  wait,  wait.  I just can't do that.  Just want to acknowledge  that that's all  I'm getting now.  You don't like  the life sucks  and then you die speech? 
[02:56:30]  I wouldn't even know  if that was on.  I don't know.  It's very funny.  So you want to read  Dana White UFC  his latest tweet  for everybody, Sam?  We should probably  do a tweet alert  first.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sorry.  Oh, do we got one?  We should play  the one we have.  Attention, folks!  Tweet!  Coming!  Oh, is that annoying?  That's your cue, Sam. 
[02:57:00]  That's fucking terrible.  Now you've fucked up  the cue.  You've got to play it again.  Attention, folks!  To  we  coming!  This is from  Dana White UFC.  Dana says,  Opie and Anthony  in an hour,  exclamation point,  exclamation point,  exclamation point,  fuck Stern,  O and A are way  better than Stern.  Now, Dana White  said that?  Yeah.  And if we read that,  there'd be some  kind of problem. 
[02:57:30]  Trust me.  Hey, he tweeted it.  He has 597,000 followers.  That's it?  That's a lot more than I got.  Is that a lot?  Yeah.  That's a lot.  How many you have?  Let me check.  Not that many.  Yeah, we don't look  at that number  and cry at night.  Well, you know.  Hey, Sam,  your Jacktober  is two,  three days away.  I know.  I'm excited.  Does it start Friday?  Thursday.  This Thursday?  Yeah.  Fuck.  Are you ready to go?  Hell yeah.  What's your first show? 
[02:58:00]  I was thinking about  starting with a show  called,  I think their name  is Rocky and Sue.  They're a married couple  from Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.  Oh,  they're married?  Yeah.  That ought to be cute.  I can't wait for Jacktober.  Jacktober is one of my  favorite times of the year.  It's because you just,  you pick on people  for no reason.  Like,  usually the radio show  will say something  negative about us.  Yes.  But in this,  for the entire month  of October,  it's just making fun  for no reason.  Of course.  Just because they suck. 
[02:58:30]  Yes.  That's pretty much it.  You know why  I like Jacktober at?  That means we could  show up at six o'clock.  No show prep for the boys.  None.  None needed.  Nope.  We just laugh at these dummies.  It's a little rougher on me,  but it's worth it.  Well,  you know.  And remember we started  another segment,  another bit today  called Pat Ourselves on the Back.  Yes.  And we're the workhorses  of SiriusXM.  Of course.  I'm going to follow Dana,  by the way,  from now on.  Oh,  are you?  I'm doing the same.  I just realized  I don't follow him. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah,  we're the workhorses here  at SiriusXM.  We mock everything  and for some reason  that gets us in trouble  here and there,  but it's time  to pat ourselves  on the back.  Moby and Anthony,  the workhorses  of Satellite Radio.  Explosions,  lasers,  and Jimmy.  And Jimmy making a noise.  That's exactly  what we asked for.  It's the worst noise ever.  Women hate when you do that 
[02:59:30]  while you're eating that pussy.  Like,  if you're looking  at a girl's clit  and she's just about to come  and you start going,  it really ruins it for them.  Deer Hunter,  the sequel to Bambi?  Yes,  as a matter of fact,  it was.  It really was,  yeah.  That came in a lot.  Dana White next.  He just signed in,  so why don't we take  a very quick break  and we're going to  end the show  with Dana White.  Good.  We're going to ask him  about Rampage Jackson,  Brock Lesnar,  where the fuck has he been?  We need Brock Lesnar. 
[03:00:00]  Heyshawaka?  I want to ask you  about Heyshawaka.  Heyshawaka?  We'll come back.  Bless you.  Oh,  Jack LaLanne's still alive.  He's still alive.  How old is he?  He's got to be,  I think he's about 60 now.  Let's take a quick break  so we don't have to,  because he might only  have a short period of time.  All right,  and we'll ask him about  Chuck Liddell doing  that Dance with the Stars shit.  Oh,  God,  do we have the clip?  Cue that clip up  because I want him to  see it while we see it.  Mars has breaking news. 
[03:00:30]  That's the fucking news.  Oh,  I got breaking news.  Hold on.  I got a breaking news.  I got a breaking news sweeper.  Travis,  hold on.  I got a breaking news sweeper.  Hold on.  Mars has breaking news.  Hold on.  I didn't think we were  going to play this today.  I'm so excited.  I'm breaking news.  Oh,  there's news  that's breaking.  Yes,  Mars.  What's that?  No,  I have no breaking news.  What's that?  I think you do.  I was fooled. 
[03:01:00]  I have Dana White's  Twitter.  When did he send this out?  Supposedly about an hour ago.  Supposedly.  Okay.  What is this?  What is this?  We were just talking about movies.  Well,  hang on.  We need a Twitter alert.  Oh,  wait,  a Twitter alert.  Twitter alert.  Attention,  folks,  to  we  coming.  I don't know.  You think it's a good idea? 
[03:01:30]  Your penmanship  sucks,  Jimmy.  It says,  fuck a break.  Oh,  yeah,  but I got a leak.  We'll do a quick break.  Go ahead.  Will you do your tweet?  Read it.  You got it.  I wouldn't read it on the air.  I know.  Look,  as long as me,  Ann,  or Jimmy don't read it,  we're okay.  I wouldn't read it on the air.  Read it.  Go ahead.  I read it.  Jim says he wouldn't read it on the air.  Go ahead.  So we're saying we would.  Just read it.  Go ahead.  Jane is waiting out there.  Just read it.  Jane is waiting. 
[03:02:00]  Go ahead.  Read it.  You got the UFC shirt on.  Come on,  guys.  Don't get me in trouble,  man.  Just read it.  Go ahead.  It's from Dana White,  UFC on Twitter.  Go ahead.  The messenger.  Yo,  go.  Opie and Anthony in an hour.  Fuck Stern.  O and A are way better than Stern.  Why would you read that on the air?  Are you crazy?  That's like,  I thought you were reading the second tweet.  You're going to be fired now,  bro.  I thought you were reading the second tweet down.  Yeah,  that was fucking ridiculous.  Second tweet down.  Why would you run in with that?  All right,  listen.  Nice working with you. 
[03:02:30]  Dana's in there.  He's a big star.  We got to take a break.  A very quick break.  Just to take a leak.  And we'll be on in like three minutes with Dana.  One leak.  Three.  Yeah,  how long do we take the piss?  We're not going to rub helmets.  A quick break is 13 minutes.  Run.  No.  All right,  we'll figure it out.  It'll be quick.  Opie and Anthony.  Got to get right into this.  Dana White in the studio from UFC,  of course.  Our friend.  I think we could say he's our friend now.  This is my favorite radio show.  Yeah.  We're very happy.  Here's how I know Dana's real.  When I saw him at the UFC event,  he came up and he went,  hi,  Jim.  Usually when you do radio with somebody, 
[03:03:00]  they actually see you.  I was on the Opie and Anthony show.  I was like,  oh,  you were next to me.  But he actually remembered me and came up.  So he's for real.  Dana,  I went to my first UFC event in Philly.  A lot of people know by now.  And Dana works the crowd in between the fights  and before,  you know,  the taping and stuff.  And he's taking pictures with everybody.  I'm thinking to myself,  he's got a lot to do.  What the fuck is he doing working in the crowd,  right?  And then some girl goes up to Dana and goes,  hey,  could you get Chuck Liddell to sign this for me?  And I'm like,  do you realize who you're talking to?  But certainly he grabbed the thing,  went to Chuck, 
[03:03:30]  got his sign,  and walked it back to the lady.  How big were the girls' tits?  That's an important question.  This guy has a pay-per-view to worry about,  and he's getting things signed.  So if you go to these events,  you know,  he's more than happy to do that for you.  I love the fans.  You know,  this sport's grown so fast  in a short amount of time,  and it's because of the fans.  The fans of this sport are crazy.  They're passionate,  and I love it,  man.  But your fighters are always cool.  It's like I've watched enough of them 
[03:04:00]  interact with crowd members,  and I've spoken to enough of them,  and they're never dicks to the fans.  They always talk to people.  You know what, man?  And it goes back to when I was a kid.  When I was a kid,  I was such a huge boxing fan,  and I knew everybody around the ring  and the ring and all this stuff,  and I remember what it felt like to go there  and how excited you are  and just to be a part of everything.  And here's actually a funny story,  but when I was a kid, too,  I was at the library one day.  I was a little kid,  and one of the newscasters,  you know, 
[03:04:30]  one of the guys that was on the local Las Vegas news,  was at the library,  and that was a big celebrity to me, man.  So I ran up to him,  and I asked him for his autograph.  He couldn't have been a bigger dick.  You know what I mean?  And I just remember what that felt like  when I saw that guy,  and I was actually at dinner last night  here in New York,  and I was hearing a story about A-Rod,  and said he was at a restaurant the other night,  and a little kid went up to him,  and they said,  this guy could not have been  a bigger dickhead in the world,  you know?  And it's just these athletes are stupid, man.  They don't get it.  Well, Jimmy doesn't like baseball players 
[03:05:00]  in general anymore.  They're all pricks.  Because of that attitude.  They're all,  every,  like so many athletes,  baseball players,  football players,  a lot of the boxers  that we've interviewed,  some of them have been very cool,  most of them have been pricks.  They're fucking pricks.  To be honest with you, though,  I don't think A-Rod makes enough money  to be signing autographs at dinner.  You know?  Exactly.  Leave the guy alone.  Exactly.  And it's one thing,  if you're sitting there  trying to have dinner with your girl,  and you've got a bunch of people  coming up,  but dude,  you chose that life.  That's the life you chose.  True.  And now you want to treat people  like shit that are coming to, 
[03:05:30]  you know?  Yeah.  Especially if it's a little kid.  I just don't,  especially little kids.  Maybe it was a million.  Yeah, but they're excuses.  They're excuses.  They're working for somebody else,  and they're getting autographs,  and then someone else.  So what?  Yeah, fucking take the chance.  Exactly, like you just said,  how much money are you making?  And you can tell if somebody's there  to get an autograph to sell,  and a little kid that's just there.  Well, they send the little,  gee, could I have an autograph?  They do send the little kids in,  but whatever.  There's real little kids  that really want,  you know,  to meet the A-Rod for a second.  Dude, let me tell you what.  Let me tell you how messed up you are 
[03:06:00]  when you're worried about  if somebody's trying to sell  your autograph.  You're so out of touch with reality,  it's not even funny.  You know what I mean?  Dude, if my name on a piece of paper  is worth something to you,  go for it.  Yeah, here you go.  You mean you've been standing out here  in the rain for 10 hours  to get my name on a piece of paper,  and you can make money off that?  Good for you, man.  Go for it.  You can pretty much just cut checks  for people just by signing something  and throwing it to them.  You are so out of touch with reality  if you're worried about  where your autograph is going.  You're a dickhead.  I heard somebody asked DiMaggio  for an autograph,  because those guys didn't make shit  back in the early days, 
[03:06:30]  and he goes,  write me a check  and I'll sign the back of it.  Then you get it back.  I was like,  I like that answer.  Hey, that is good.  Yeah.  That works.  We've got to get into this.  Should we start with  the Chuck Liddell thing?  We love Chuck.  You know we love Chuck.  Yeah, I know.  And we love the fact  that he's getting all that exposure  on Dancing with the Stars.  We played his performance  the other day.  We haven't laughed that hard.  Where's Danny?  Is he still on the show?  I don't even know.  He is.  He danced last night. 
[03:07:00]  I was flying here last night  and we landed  and I had to go to dinner  so I didn't see it,  his performance last night,  but apparently  his performance last night  was pretty good.  we saw the one  the week before  and he's doing  those slides  and just sticking  to the floor  and almost  skipping a little bit.  It was hysterical.  The hat's on crooked.  If he comes in here  we'll say,  hey, what's up Fred Astaire?  We're not going to say  shit to his face. 
[03:07:30]  It was so goddamn funny.  It was like watching  the skating scene  in King Kong  in the park.  It is funny to watch  a bruiser  because he's an athletic guy,  but just to watch  a bruiser be like  a gentleman with a hat  it was just kind of  funny to watch.  You know we could  just kill somebody,  anybody in there.  His instinct is just  to knock somebody's  fucking chest in  with his fist.  It's so goddamn funny.  Tipping his bolo hat  like a gentleman.  It's hilarious.  The perfect gentleman.  I do want to look at it again.  I have to see that.  Someone's got to get it 
[03:08:00]  on screen.  I'm sure last night's  performance is probably  on YouTube.  I'm going to have  to watch it too.  I didn't see it yet.  And then tonight's the vote.  So we've got to get  all the UFC fans  to vote.  Well, they did.  Last night was the voting.  You had to vote last night.  Yeah, trust me.  I got it covered.  You got it covered?  Oh, yeah.  I've been pumping them  like crazy.  Oh, you sent that Twitter out,  right?  I actually read that today.  Okay, cool.  Oh, great.  Yeah.  I didn't know you guys  were on my Twitter.  I joined up today.  I only follow like five people  and then they said,  oh, Dana White.  And I looked you up  and you had 1,100 followers.  I'm like, wow, 
[03:08:30]  Dana's not fucking hot on Twitter.  And then I said,  Dana White UFC.  I'm like, oh, okay,  there's the guy.  Almost 600,000.  That makes sense.  I was frightened.  1,100.  I'm like,  what kind of tweets  is he sending out?  Isn't that stuff  somebody has your name?  Somebody has Dana White  and they're sending out nothing.  I didn't know that.  Well, yeah,  but Dana White UFC  is almost 600,000 people.  Jimmy, what kind of tweets  would he be sending out  to get 1,100 followers?  I don't know.  Just photos of his feet.  Look, he's smelled today.  That would be a good tweet  to read, though. 
[03:09:00]  Photos of his feet.  Yeah, what an awful...  How many of those  would you get  before you just go,  I'm not following this guy anymore?  I love the UFC,  but what's wrong with him?  First one, you'd be like,  this is a little eclectic.  I'm not following this guy.  Right enough.  His pinky nail is like...  All right, here's...  Let me look for the Dana White.  Here's...  We have to do this,  the Dana White.  I'm sorry.  Why don't you, Dana?  E-Rock, turn that a little bit  before I bite your face.  Not that one.  Not that one.  Dana can see us.  No.  Wait, what? 
[03:09:30]  We almost took our head off  with the hat.  See, he's not bad.  When he's doing the regular moves  like that,  he's doing good.  Look at his face, though.  He's got Eye of the Tiger.  Yeah, I know.  And I love when he...  Look at when he pretends  to smile.  It's great, though.  This is great.  Look at this.  Look at this slide.  I love that one.  Holy shit.  Oh, we just love Chuck. 
[03:10:00]  Look at him.  I just pick myself up  and get back in the race.  That's funny.  Oh, Chuck.  Chuck rules.  Hey, he's taking it seriously, though.  Yeah, he is.  He's working it.  He's working it.  He is just a killer.  But dancing.  People love Liddell, though.  I mean, he's like a beloved guy, man.  He's another guy  that's great for the fans.  Yes, he is.  And he worked that crowd.  He lost a lot of weight, huh, Dana?  Yeah, he did.  The thing that I like about it is, 
[03:10:30]  you know...  That's on sideways.  He and I are in this whole  retirement battle right now.  You know, he's one of my best friends.  I love this guy.  And I'm glad to see him  doing something  that he actually cares about  and that he's excited about.  He got in shape for this thing.  He lost weight.  He took it very serious.  I mean,  I guarantee you  he couldn't dance like that  three months ago.  Yeah, yeah.  And then I'm sure  as the show goes on,  if he continues  to be on the show,  he'll get better. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, I'm just happy  to see him focused  and doing something  that he's into.  You know, he cares about it.  Because this guy's,  believe me,  the stuff that he does  when he's not dancing,  you guys wouldn't be  making fun of  or laughing at all.  You'd be bowing down.  You'd be bowing down  right now  to the lifestyle  this guy lives.  We openly admit that.  It's fun to watch.  He's a guy we know.  It's like watching  your buddy dance.  Especially because  if you don't know Chuck,  you just see this guy.  He's got kind of  like a frightening haircut. 
[03:11:30]  But it's like  you've seen him  fight enough times  and you understand  how he handles people.  Did you see me  in the crowd there?  Did you see me?  No.  When he runs over  and does this thing,  I'm sitting there.  I'm laughing so hard  I'm almost laying  on the chair.  Yeah.  I'm almost laying  on the chair.  I'm laughing so hard.  Hey, Jordan figured it out.  Jordan Scranton, PA.  For Dana White  to get 1,100 followers,  he'd probably have to do  some sort of contest  where a random  Twitter follower  wins a free kick  in the chest  from Brock Lesnar.  Yes. 
[03:12:00]  Yes.  First prize  is a bag of shit.  Second prize  is a kick in the chest  from Brock.  But it's a random  prize is a hat.  But he just picks  a random follower.  The worst contest ever.  But no,  the Dana White  that I'm talking about,  the recent tweets  are not coming up  because everyone's  probably checking it out.  But this Dana White,  it just says,  I rule under his name  and it's only 1,491 followers.  So I don't know  if he has...  It's growing though  if it was 1,100 before.  No, I think I actually  guesstimated.  I think it was 1,491.  He doesn't rule though.  No, he certainly doesn't. 
[03:12:30]  No, he doesn't.  It's probably not even his name.  All right,  so you were laughing too  and to get into it  a little bit,  we talked to you  about Fedor.  I'm telling you,  man,  the more I think of it,  the more I'm not  going to be surprised  if someday it comes out  that his people  were frightened  of fucking Lesnar  in that cage.  And I like Fedor a lot,  but Brock is a fucking  scary dude, man.  I'm telling you, man,  he is.  He is.  And he's just such a...  I actually had breakfast  with him on Saturday morning.  He was in Vegas  on Saturday morning. 
[03:13:00]  What does he eat for breakfast,  that guy?  Everything.  And, you know,  he's just...  He's telling me,  listen,  he'll fight as much  as we want him to fight.  This guy just wants to fight.  Yeah.  He says,  but I need September  and October off.  It's hunting season,  you know?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And Joe Rogan  always says it.  It's so funny, man.  He's like,  you know,  this guy,  when he's not smashing  people in the cage,  he's killing animals.  That's what this guy's...  I mean,  he's like,  you know,  and it's true.  And not little ones either.  Brock Lesnar is... 
[03:13:30]  He's a big game hunter.  He's not like any other guy  that I've ever met.  He's really not.  He probably just punches  the animals, too.  No bow and arrow.  He just walks up  and belts the deer  in the head.  Hey, Brock,  where's your gun?  What are you,  a pussy?  He's just strangling  large animals  in the woods by himself.  Grappling with a bear.  No,  he's definitely not  like any other human being  I've ever met.  He's just like  one of those guys,  it's just like,  he looks like an impossible guy  to knock out.  Frank Mir's a tough dude. 
[03:14:00]  He's a fucking,  he's a heavyweight fighter  and to see him  with his,  in a headlock,  like,  that's how I would get beat up.  That was like watching  one pro beat up another pro,  like the way I would get beat up.  It was really fucking  uncomfortable to watch.  It was really uncomfortable.  And Bob Kelly in the back,  good job, Frank.  He didn't know what to say.  No.  He wanted to just bond with,  because you want to say something  to a beaten fighter  that's nice.  You want to make him feel better.  But as,  you know,  Bob was just so nervous.  You went,  hey,  good job,  man.  I wish Frank just  would have knocked  his fucking teeth out.  Stupid Bob.  Let's have a cup of coffee. 
[03:14:30]  And,  let's,  can we talk about Rampage  a little bit too?  Because that was kind of a big surprise  to everybody that he,  that he left.  Yeah.  You know,  the reality is,  you know,  has Rampage,  has he left?  No.  He's mad at me.  You know,  we've gone back and forth  about this whole movie thing.  Rampage will fight.  Okay.  Rampage will fight.  Do you not want him  to do the movie  or was it the timing of the movie?  No,  I didn't,  yeah,  it was the timing of the movie  right after the show.  You know,  this is a big season for us.  He committed to doing it  and I was pissed 
[03:15:00]  when he said  he was going to do the movie  instead of the fight.  And the movie  was really important to him  so he's pissed at me.  You know.  What did you say about it  because I didn't hear what you said.  Did you just,  did you knock the movie itself  or him doing it?  No,  him doing it,  I knocked the movie,  I knocked him doing it  and then,  you know,  that started the whole war.  Okay.  And,  you know,  Rampage,  me and Rampage are friends.  Right.  We're friends  and I care about that guy.  He's a good guy.  He's a great guy.  So,  we'll figure this thing out.  And you stood by him too 
[03:15:30]  after when Rampage had his trouble.  Dana was right there for him.  Dana defended him on the air  and then went and saw him.  I mean,  you didn't just walk away.  A lot of guys walked away  from a fight or somebody  that was in trouble.  He was in a tough spot there  for a while  and Dana was right there for him.  Yeah.  We'll get this thing worked out.  Like I said,  I always say,  man,  if me and Tito can figure things out,  I can figure things out  with anybody.  No kidding.  Yeah,  that wasn't looking too good  for a while.  Yeah.  If I do this show  with Jerry Springer on  in the background,  I keep watching  the Jerry Springer show.  Oh,  oh no.  We like keeping track  of our friends. 
[03:16:00]  He does the show  from time to time.  Maury and fucking Wendy,  we have the worst TV on.  I know,  it's got to be something  better than this.  There's been 27 fights  since I've been on the show  over here.  On Maury?  Yeah.  Maury,  we love it.  Yeah,  that's what it is.  Maury actually,  he comes in.  He's a blast to hang with.  Threesomes,  look it,  this one's about threesomes.  Would you have a threesome?  Fucking her alone's a threesome.  What a set-up.  Holy shit.  What a beast.  A monster.  She has a mouth like Predator. 
[03:16:30]  What a fat show.  Maury is,  yeah,  we have Maury on the show  every so often  and he knows,  he'll be on the show  and sometimes he has people  that have had  horrible things happen to him.  Disfigurements,  birth defects,  whatever it is.  And he brings him out  like P.T. Barnum  out on the stage  but then he goes,  you know something,  you are beautiful.  Let me tell you,  and the audience claps  and you're looking at this  horrific friggin  Rocky Dennis head  and he knows, 
[03:17:00]  we call him out on it  all the time.  I'm like,  we know what you're doing,  Maury,  but no.  And Brock Lesnar's  going to be in UFC 106,  right?  Okay,  so we got a couple more  months out,  obviously.  Hey,  Herschel Walker,  come on.  We're on the same page.  We're like,  what is this fucking guy doing?  What is this guy doing?  Oh my God,  listen,  I've met Herschel Walker  at fights.  He's a big fan.  He's a super nice guy.  I mean,  not to smash him  or say anything bad about it,  but come on.  We saw him on The Apprentice.  50 years old 
[03:17:30]  and he's going to come in  and fight MMA.  Now,  think about this.  He's really,  really good at football.  The guy was a good football player.  He's too old to play football.  Yeah,  yeah.  But he's going to come in  and fight  in mixed martial arts.  The reality is  that whole Showtime,  Showtime,  CBS,  the whole thing,  it's a freak show.  It's a freak show.  Those guys aren't putting on real fights.  They're putting on a freak show.  They're the Maury of the fight business.  You know what I mean?  They're the Jerry Springer  of the fight business.  Yeah,  it's almost like  when they put together,  you know,  like Greg Brady fighting. 
[03:18:00]  Exactly.  That's great.  Danny Bonaduce.  Do you know what I heard?  You know,  our fight in Manchester,  England,  we're doing Randy Couture  versus Brandon Vera  and that's going to be live  on Spike TV.  I heard that now  they're going to do  Couture versus Vera,  the wives of Couture.  Are you kidding me?  Who's doing that?  CBS and Showtime.  CBS and Showtime  are the Jerry Springer  of mixed martial arts.  They're the freak show.  What are you doing that for?  The wives? 
[03:18:30]  Well,  Kim Couture  isn't even married  to Randy anymore,  but she's going to keep  that last name.  Oh, yeah.  When did that go down?  She didn't get rid of that name.  Didn't we have  I think we had them in together, yeah.  They're not married anymore?  We just had a divorce, yeah.  A year ago, I think.  Not even.  Yep.  Who's brave enough  to pick Randy Couture's wife  up at her fucking house?  Why would you date that woman?  Did you see what her husband  does for a living?  What's wrong with you?  I can't.  Jesus Christ.  That can't be good.  I would never date  the ex-wife of a fighter.  Is he happy, though?  Is he all right?  Yeah, no, he's great. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, he's great.  What, he's 45 years old?  The guy's a fucking machine.  Randy Couture is a machine.  He's phenomenal, man.  I tell you, I've never seen anything like it.  A guy who, at that age,  it just, he gets better and better.  See the fight with him and Noguera?  No, it went the distance, though, right?  Oh, I'm telling you,  you guys got to see that fight.  The Noguera-Couture fight  is one of the best fights  I've seen in a while.  Yeah.  Back and forth,  you think Couture's done,  Couture gets out and gets back up  and they start going at it again.  Great fight.  Actually, Lesnar was there  with me watching that fight 
[03:19:30]  and we were going crazy  during that fight.  He actually started cheering Randy on.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Randy gave him a,  I mean, look, considering  Randy did not just fucking  roll over for Brock Lesnar.  No.  I mean, that was a tough fight.  I think Randy's fought him  the best of anybody  in the UFC so far.  Yeah.  No doubt about it.  He almost took him down  three or four times.  So Lesnar was kind of  rooting for him after a while?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I think Lesnar was going,  oh, yeah,  this will be a big money fight  if I can fight him again.  Does he want to fight Randy again?  No.  Well, Randy didn't win  so it'll never happen. 
[03:20:00]  He'll end up fighting.  He's going to fight Shane Carwin  November 21st  and this is a real fight.  Shane Carwin, 6'5",  265 pounds.  Great wrestler,  great striker  and hates Brock Lesnar.  Wow.  Hates Brock Lesnar.  Why does he hate him?  Talks bad about him publicly  all the time.  Doesn't like his persona.  Doesn't like the way  he treats people.  Doesn't like a lot of things about,  doesn't like his tattoo.  Doesn't like a lot of things  about Brock.  But if Brock Lesnar 
[03:20:30]  gets past Shane Carwin,  he'll fight Noguera.  Okay.  So Shane Carwin has,  now that's 105,  106 Shane.  No, but 105 I think  is in England  and that is when?  It's November 14th,  I think.  Okay.  And then November,  November 21st  is Lesnar versus Carwin  in Las Vegas.  Jesus.  That's the Lesnar's fighting.  So you're flying us out  for that one,  obviously.  Yep.  That was the one  when you got fired.  Yeah,  because I wanted to go to England.  Uncomfortable.  No, no,  Jim, the jersey.  I'm flying you guys  to Manchester, England. 
[03:21:00]  When Lesnar's fighting  in Vegas,  we'll be in England  being fucking raped  by soccer hooligans.  Shane obviously is bigger  than Brock Lesnar then,  huh?  Yeah,  they're the same size.  Pretty much the same size.  And Shane Carwin's undefeated.  I don't know much  about Shane.  How many fights does he have?  Still figuring this whole sport out.  I think he's 16 or 17 and out.  Okay,  so he's got more experience too.  Yeah.  And Lesnar's...  How long has he been  in the UFC, Shane?  Carwin has been with us  for a couple years.  Oh, he has been.  Okay, 
[03:21:30]  see,  I gotta get more knowledge.  That's right.  So that could really be...  Yeah,  no,  that's an interesting fight.  Very interesting fight.  Two big guys,  man.  Giant behemoths in there.  Exactly.  Two real heavyweights.  Yeah.  Yeah.  After Lesnar came in  and kind of did his little  mea culpa after he screwed up,  I really started to like him.  Like,  I didn't like Lesnar at first,  but then when he came in  and humanized himself,  I was like,  yeah,  you're like,  I fucked up.  It's like,  I kind of liked the reality of that.  I kind of liked what he did  after the fight in the ring.  In the cage or whatever. 
[03:22:00]  You're gonna find people  who like both.  Yeah,  you know,  you're gonna find it.  I can tell you this,  Bud Light didn't like it.  You had some smoothing over to do.  Bud Light didn't like it,  and I was horrified.  Man,  that was like an out-of-body  experience for me.  I was floating above the octagon  going,  this is not happening right now.  Just watching that live,  you must have just been like,  oh my God,  I gotta get to the Bud Light  people immediately.  I know.  Believe me when I tell you,  my sponsorship guy got to me  before I even,  I mean,  before he was even done talking,  Bud Light had already said. 
[03:22:30]  Shit.  Yeah,  I mean,  it was just,  it was crazy.  You wanna hear the craziest part  of the whole thing?  Afterwards,  it ends up,  his people have never even tried  to talk to Bud Light.  Really?  Yeah,  I think he was just in this like,  crazy,  you have to understand too,  this guy is still,  you know,  he doesn't have a lot of  fight experience,  and there's a lot of emotion,  a lot of pent up.  Frank Mir had beat him once,  right,  when he first,  his first fight ever in the UFC.  He doesn't have a lot of experience.  He's going back in against Frank Mir.  Frank Mir's talking tons of trash. 
[03:23:00]  You know,  he had a lot of built up,  you know,  anger,  and he was anxious and nervous,  and all that,  yeah,  everything going on.  And I think he was just up there  about the interview  and looked at Bud Light  and like,  went psycho on Bud Light  for some reason,  you know?  He had never even talked to Bud Light.  Remember he said,  they wouldn't sponsor me!  Wait, what?  People never even called Bud Light.  They never even talked to Bud Light.  So do you think,  did he feel like,  after a while,  like,  because he kind of taunted Mir  after he really beat him  pretty badly,  did he ever kind of,  did they ever talk about it?  Did they ever speak?  I think they have. 
[03:23:30]  I think,  actually,  when I saw Brock the other day,  he said that they had,  he had bumped into Frank  at the,  the,  the muscle convention  out there right now.  I can't remember  what it's called.  The Olympia.  The Olympia is in Las Vegas.  And,  you know,  they have this big convention  and they had Booth set up there  and he bumped into Mir  and I think they talked.  What do you say,  I wonder like,  when guys like that,  like,  when one guy's beating  the other guy,  what do you,  what do you,  like,  what's the relationship become?  Like,  is one guy just dominant  because he won the fight  or they both realize that, 
[03:24:00]  look,  we're both kind of equals  in this whole thing  or is it kind of like,  do you understand what I mean?  Like,  that's a good question.  A lot of these guys  really respect each other  and one of the great things  about the UFC  is,  is like I always say,  the sportsmanship,  you see after a big fight,  no matter how much trash talking  went on and everything else.  But these are the kind of guys  that at the press conference  for pre-fight,  they can sit there  at the same table  and have lunch together  and,  you know,  what people have to understand  is it's competition,  it's competing.  They don't have to hate each other  to compete against each other.  But some people do. 
[03:24:30]  Sometimes it happens  and obviously that makes it  a little more exciting.  It's different than some guy,  you know,  stealing your chick  and fucking her  and then you see him  in the street  and go,  hey,  you won now.  Or you could just say,  hey,  thanks for straightening her out.  That's why  you never bet that way before.  That's why these guys  are just animals.  Any one of us  gets punched in the face,  we immediately hate that person.  Well,  yeah.  But these guys,  in the end,  they'll have a beer together.  That's their job.  Well,  literally,  it's like, 
[03:25:00]  you know,  you guys know,  you're that much better  than Howard Stern.  And,  you know,  when you see Howard,  you got to bump into him  here in the hallways  and when he shows up  for work,  when he does come in,  you know,  when he's working,  you'll bump into him.  We call him the part-timer.  He's got a good gig.  He's the part-timer.  He cashed out  and when he does show up here  to,  you know,  do his show,  you guys bump into him.  You know you that much.  Bump into him in the hallway?  I don't know.  You know you that much better than him.  So,  I don't know.  What is that?  What's it like?  Like when he sees you,  does he know that you guys  kick his ass?  Never see him.  We don't,  we never bump into him 
[03:25:30]  in the hallway.  Honestly,  I have not seen him  one time since I've been here.  There are people that have,  not once.  He's been here two years,  whatever,  and people still haven't seen him.  He takes like a bat pole  down to his limo or something.  His limo is brought up  in an elevator.  For real.  Interesting.  Yeah.  So we don't see him.  And you know this is,  they built a studio around him.  And Danny,  you know this is going to get back to him  and he's going to go,  well,  you know,  he's trashing me  because I wouldn't have him  on my show.  Well,  I don't even think  I've ever tried to get on his show.  Okay,  well,  we'll get that out there  because that's what he's going to say.  Yeah,  well,  I've never tried to get on his show  and to be honest with you, 
[03:26:00]  and this is honest,  dude,  what do I care?  Like I'm trying to bust into  the Howard Stern show  or something.  Honestly and truly,  I'm not a fan of Howard Stern  and there's been several times  when they've wanted to do  the Ring Card Girls,  you know,  to go on the Stern show  and I wouldn't do it.  Like,  I'm not going to put them on there  and have him degrade them.  I'm not here,  Robert.  I have to take a week off  for Groundhog Day,  Robert.  Very important.  I'm not going to...  He's got the week off 
[03:26:30]  because I guess there was some...  I'm not going to do that  to the Octagon Girls  to go on his show  and whatever.  I'm just not a Stern fan,  you know?  Yeah.  And I,  you know,  I started some shit  on Twitter today,  man,  that people were buzzing  and going crazy.  Oh,  yeah,  there's a little battle  going on there,  but...  Yeah,  we're all one big happy family.  I can tell.  That's wonderful.  Yeah,  there's no I in team.  I'm fond of saying that.  Fucking crying,  looking at my shitty paycheck.  There's an I in shitty.  I love the honesty 
[03:27:00]  in Dana White,  though.  Do you ever hold back?  Do you always think  to just speak your mind?  Why not,  though?  Why shouldn't you?  It's refreshing,  but just...  We live in this world  where,  man,  it's like,  when you watch TV  and you see these guys,  whether it's a big major  sports organization,  whatever it is,  they're reading shit  that either  their attorney wrote  and drafted  and looked over 57 times  or...  And you know  they're lying to you. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  It's not like  we don't just sit here  and go,  this guy's lying,  he's not telling the truth,  and I respect people.  Let me tell you what.  Here we go.  I'll get into this again,  but Michael Vick,  man.  Michael Vick,  what happened to this guy  and what he did  was terrible.  I don't think  I've ever seen anybody  take more shit  than this guy has.  I mean,  this guy has been  pounded into the dirt  and all his money's gone.  He went to jail forever.  I mean,  there's guys  that play in the NFL  that have killed people 
[03:28:00]  drinking and driving  and not killed human beings.  Have killed human beings  drinking and driving  and not caught the shit.  He's not gone through  what Michael Vick  has gone through.  Because we do care  about pets more than humans.  Apparently.  Oh, yeah.  If you took a poll,  most people would agree to.  People are,  this guy gets,  finally,  he's paid his penance,  man.  He's lost all his money.  He's gone to jail.  He's been publicly humiliated,  smashed,  everything else.  He took the rap  for most of his friends  who were hanging out,  living off him  at his house,  you know,  who took a big part of this. 
[03:28:30]  I mean,  this guy's in the NFL.  He's training.  I mean,  I know how much  I'm at my house,  okay?  I can imagine  how little Mike Vick  was at his house,  right?  So,  he goes through  all this stuff,  takes it right on the chin,  okay?  And,  takes the fall,  does everything,  does everything they ask of him,  and he finally gets a job again.  The Philadelphia Eagles sign him.  And there's people  protesting out front.  Yeah,  they want him fired.  Vicks and Eagle,  hide your beagle,  and crazy shit like this,  man.  Now,  the thing that makes me  respect this guy so much  is not once, 
[03:29:00]  ever,  in the public,  I'm sure at his house  he says it,  but never once in the public  has this guy said,  hey,  look at these guys.  Look what,  nobody said that,  he didn't say anything.  He's taken it like a man,  and now he's trying  to make a comeback,  man.  I just have so much respect  for this guy.  It's not in,  listen,  at the end of the day,  we're all human beings,  and we're all gonna make mistakes,  man.  Everybody makes mistakes,  everybody does dumb things,  you slip up,  but it's how you bounce back,  and how you handle yourself  after you make that mistake,  and I don't think anybody 
[03:29:30]  in the history of making mistakes  has taken it the way Vic has.  I had mixed feelings about him.  Like,  at first I was like,  let the guy work,  he paid his,  and then the more I kept hearing  that he was,  he was like torturing,  and then my emotions were like,  fuck that motherfucker,  he was like,  he was brutalizing  and electrocuting  and hanging and being,  just,  I'm like,  nothing worse than you do  to hookers.  But again,  at least afterwards we laugh  and we share,  we share a fucking Valtrex.  Cut that blue pill in half.  You have one,  I'll have one. 
[03:30:00]  Get out of here,  you.  Thought you were a girl.  Got me again.  And trust me,  I've had this,  I've had this conversation  with,  with,  you know,  one of the guys in my office  is a huge animal lover,  and he said the same thing,  you know,  Vic was doing this,  and there's no question,  there's no doubt  what he did was horrible.  Yeah.  What he did was horrible,  but you know,  what do you,  I mean,  at the end of the,  once you pay your dues for it.  Exactly.  What happens is,  he got busted,  and here's what they said,  you're going to go to jail 
[03:30:30]  for this amount of time,  you're not playing football,  you're going to lose,  you know,  he lost everything,  he's lost everything,  and he's gone to jail,  he's paid his penance,  he's done his time.  Yeah,  he should be,  I mean,  again,  without the emotion attached to it,  and like just the love of animals,  it is true.  I mean,  you got to let the guy work  and make a living,  and it's like he did pay,  I mean,  he did go to jail  and give up two seasons  and millions and millions,  it's not like he didn't pay a price for it.  And they were only ugly dogs,  they weren't cute dogs.  Absolutely,  and thank God he wasn't fucking them,  because that would be unforgivable  unless there was footage.  Can you imagine if they were cute dogs, 
[03:31:00]  though,  it would be a completely different story.  It's not like I'm some animal hater or something,  dude,  I won't even go hunting,  I'm like,  I'm going to go out and shoot animals for what?  You don't want to strangle animals  with Barclays?  Exactly,  and they try to make the argument,  you know,  it's for food,  dude,  I'll go to the publishing  to get some food,  man,  I'm not going out and shooting anything.  It's alright,  if I kill it,  I eat it.  I'd rather,  you know,  USDA stamp on it.  Exactly,  exactly.  Scan it at the cash register.  What does Brock hunt?  I want to know if Brock Lesnar hunts.  I think he,  obviously he hunts deer,  and I think he hunts bear, 
[03:31:30]  too.  Jesus.  Does he eat stuff?  He probably is the type of guy,  if he lives in the woods,  it actually makes...  No, he does.  This guy actually lives out in the middle of nowhere.  That's why whenever we have to have him do something,  he has to drive three and a half hours  to the airport.  Three and a half hours to the airport.  How would you do that?  So he was going home the other morning  when I was with him,  and I was like,  so when you fly home now,  how long does it take?  He says,  I have a three and a half hour drive.  He says,  looking at me like he's like,  man,  he's actually Bigfoot.  He's Sasquatch. 
[03:32:00]  Why doesn't he just have a helicopter  or something pick him up?  That's got to be,  that's a lot faster.  Yeah.  Is it?  I agree.  Yeah,  that was my brilliant contribution.  Helicopters faster than cars.  Fucking news at 11.  And stats.  A fucking dullard.  Yeah,  he's great for the sport.  Yeah,  he is great for the sport.  Does he drive or get picked up at least?  That's another,  that's like a follow up.  I follow up an awful point  with a fucking childlike question.  That's a good question.  I don't know.  I don't know if he drives himself  or if he gets picked up.  Hopefully he has somebody pick him up.  We also wanted to talk about Kimbo Slice. 
[03:32:30]  He's definitely going to be fighting  after the Ultimate Fighter?  Yeah.  Obviously,  you know,  he fights tomorrow night.  Yep.  You know,  the first episode of the Ultimate Fighter  did 5.1 million viewers.  The second episode did 4.1.  And we think tomorrow night  with Kimbo fighting  we'll beat both.  Yeah,  that'll be a big one.  Yeah,  well,  of course,  because he fought on fucking CBS  and got like,  what,  8 million people watched it?  When he fought,  there's some attraction people have to Kimbo  and it's like,  now that he's in the UFC,  it's like,  I was kind of rooting for him  to get fucking beat up before  just because he was fighting for, 
[03:33:00]  what,  Elite XC,  right?  Yeah.  But it's like,  now that he's like fighting in a legitimate place  and he respects the sport,  he seems like a guy who's trained a lot.  No,  he is.  You know,  I actually want to see him do well.  You're right.  And,  you know,  I talked a lot of shit about him  and basically said,  you know,  the only way this guy will ever fight in the UFC  is if he fights in the Ultimate Fighter  and you got to respect him,  man.  And here's the reality.  When we were out there talking to him  about him doing this,  he had a lot of other offers.  I mean,  he could have gone out and done the whole,  you know,  CBS,  Showtime,  freak show thing.  He could have done that forever  and people would have paid him to do it. 
[03:33:30]  But he's doing the right thing  and I respect him for it.  To come in and fight against these mixed martial artists  that have been training for years  and fighting for years,  you got to respect it.  So,  tomorrow night,  we'll see how he does.  Was it Silva against the fighter?  I'm sorry to be jumping all over.  Was it Silva against the boxer, Sam?  Is that who was going to fight?  Yeah,  you're thinking Roy Jones Jr.  and Anderson Silva  wanted to fight each other.  Okay,  but that's just not happening.  That was just spoken about.  Yeah.  I mean,  if Roy wants to come in to the UFC  and do that fight, 
[03:34:00]  we can do it.  But no,  I'm not going to...  You don't want to turn this thing  into a three-ring circus,  obviously.  Well,  I didn't mean attached to either sport,  just something they were doing separately.  I understand that.  No,  you're absolutely right  because here's the thing.  Back in the day when...  You have a mad respect  for what these guys are doing.  Exactly,  and I respect the boxers, too.  Two different sports.  Right.  You know,  I don't disrespect boxing at all.  That's when the races mix.  Attaboy,  Ope.  Bring it right home.  Jeez.  That just stops people in their tracks, 
[03:34:30]  though.  I missed the point.  Whenever you mention something like that,  people are like,  no,  I don't.  I hate that at all.  I just heard it differently.  I'm sorry.  I just thought,  is that what I sound like?  The reality is,  when we were bleeding money,  we could have gone the freak show,  CBS Showtime route.  We never did it.  We could have went out  and tried to get Tyson or somebody  to bring him in to fight.  We don't.  We're pure to the sport.  We believe in the sport of mixed martial arts.  Basically,  something like that would be a big hit  at first for you.  You'd get a lot of exposure,  but then it would hurt you in the long run, 
[03:35:00]  it seems like.  That's just like,  you know,  here's the thing.  Let's say we get Roy Jones Jr.  or Floyd Mayweather,  and they come in,  and they fight in the octagon.  They're going to lose.  They're going to get taken down,  and they're going to get submitted.  They're a fish out of water,  and they're two completely different sports.  It would be like,  you know.  So why don't you prove your point  and let one of these guys  get their ass kicked?  Yeah.  I mean,  but that's not what they're trying to do.  What these guys are saying  is let them come over here and box.  Oh, I see.  It's the same thing.  These guys aren't boxers,  and anybody who really knows anything  about fighting and how this works 
[03:35:30]  is two totally different styles.  You stand differently.  You distribute your weight differently.  It's just a lot of different things.  But the reality is,  boxing is a sport.  Mixed martial arts is real fighting.  It's everything.  You use everything.  You don't just go for points  and use your hands.  You can kick.  You can knee.  You can elbow.  You can punch.  You can slam to the ground.  You can use submissions.  It's real fighting.  Yeah, when you're out in the street,  you're not just, you know,  squaring off and boxing with somebody.  Hey, hey.  Gracie.  No punching.  Gracie Jiu-Jitsu was started  off the, you know, 
[03:36:00]  the reality that 90% of all fights  end up on the ground.  You know?  That's true, yeah.  And then the guys didn't know  what to do on the ground.  They put the high school headlock on you,  and they just lay there on the ground  trying to punch the top of the head.  Yeah, you know what I mean?  That's how Gracie Jiu-Jitsu  really was started.  And therefore,  those guys are Brazilian.  So, you know,  there's quite a bit of fucking strife  in Brazil.  You ever been to Rio?  No.  Fun place.  I mean, it really is.  I mean, we went buck wild  in the fucking whorehouses,  and they're kind of tolerated there.  It's not quote-unquote legal, 
[03:36:30]  but they allow it.  But it's a fucking very violent area.  There's certain areas  that are very poor there,  so you have to be able to fight  to live together.  Yeah, no, the guys who grew up  in Brazil grow up fighting  on the streets,  no doubt about it.  They fucking,  I saw some,  I was watching an old  George Foreman fight  against some Brazilian  in like 1970,  just some heavyweight.  I'm like,  you know what a tough motherfucker  you have to be  to be a heavyweight fighter  and a Brazilian  growing up in Rio de Janeiro  in a favela?  No point there,  just something I thought.  And then I also thought  I'd like some ice cream, too.  I should follow it up  with another fucking  boring thing I thought. 
[03:37:00]  Some things should remain  as thoughts.  Fucking asshole I am.  You know,  who was the Brazilian fighter?  I don't even remember,  but as I was talking,  I was like,  this is going nowhere.  There's no fucking,  there's no clever tie-in,  there's no punchline,  it just fucking  falls off a cliff.  Jimmy, welcome to my world.  It's like I started off  with a real fucking,  real head full of steam.  Oh, there's one fighter  who gives a shit.  Fuck, we love Foreman.  The more you think about Foreman,  he could have been 
[03:37:30]  the greatest of all time  if he just didn't fucking quit  like he did.  Yeah.  And then had the greatest comeback  in boxing history,  obviously.  Yep.  That guy could fucking punch.  Yeah, but you know what,  if you look at a lot of the guys  from that era,  you know,  a lot of those guys  are real punchy  and messed up from that era.  And Foreman,  taking that time off  that he did,  came back  and actually was able  to cash in  when the money  was a lot bigger  and he changed  his whole persona  and became this  big, lovable guy.  Nice guy.  If you look at who he was, 
[03:38:00]  he's the complete opposite.  He was the Mike Tyson  of that era.  He was a prick,  he was a real badass.  Mean, nasty guy  and didn't like anybody  and wasn't nice to anybody  and everything else.  Went out and found God  and took all that time off,  had 37 kids,  then had to come back.  All named George,  let's not forget.  Then had to come back  in a second  and created this huge,  larger than life persona  and made tons of money.  And we found out  he had a nice smile.  Yeah, well,  he's smiling all over the place.  And he was healthy, 
[03:38:30]  you know,  he took that time off  and didn't get punished.  Not all punchy.  It's tough to see Ali like that.  Yeah.  When you go back  and watch some of those documentaries  and I've seen today,  it's a lot.  I've watched every Ali documentary  there is, man.  I have Ali pictures  in my house.  You see the one  with Frasier recently?  It just came out.  Thriller in Manila?  Thriller in Manila.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  No, I've seen that.  That just came out  about a year ago.  Frasier was in here  promoting it  and he still hates it.  He hates it.  Oh, yeah.  I know.  He will not let it go.  I know.  No, it's true.  He let us,  I'm sorry, 
[03:39:00]  on the special,  he plays  his answer,  his outgoing message  and it's got something  to do with Ali  and the condition.  Like, fucking Frasier  hates Ali  because of the way  he taunted him racially.  Oh, I know.  Actually, the show  you're talking about  is the Spike,  Spike TV did that show.  No, it's a documentary.  It's called  The Thriller Manila.  It was released on DVD.  Oh, there's a new one.  There's a new one  coming out called,  it's Remembering Ali  or something like that  that Spike TV did  and it's about  Frasier and Ali.  It's really good,  actually. 
[03:39:30]  I saw a screening of it.  It might be the same thing  and they're just  putting it on Spike TV.  Yeah, that's it.  That's what you guys  are thinking of.  It didn't get a lot  of exposure.  I don't remember  seeing it in theaters  or anything.  Yeah, it's really good.  It's the whole story  of Frasier and you guys  and when he says  they talked to Frasier's son  and he said Ali  went up to him  and said,  sorry about that  and he said, yeah  and Frasier said  he should have said it  to me, not you.  Yeah, he said it  to Marcus Frasier.  Ali called him  in the dressing room.  That was after the  third fight  which they said  Ali actually said  cut the gloves off me 
[03:40:00]  and Frasier was just  losing his eyesight.  Right, and they stopped  the fight in the other corner  when Ali was going to  quit in the other corner.  How amazing is that?  It's just unbelievable.  I love that shit.  Frasier was here for an hour  and he started singing  after a while.  He's a punchy dude  but he was a fun guy  to talk to  but sometimes boxers  trail off into their own  But when you think about it  man, that's when  that's when boxers  were real guys, man.  That's when they were like  you know, those two  went to war  you know, when they were  fighting 15 rounds  15 rounds 
[03:40:30]  just toe to toe  blasting each other  and  those were the days  that made me  a big boxing fan.  Dana, you're bringing  that excitement back  to bring it back to you.  The UFC is bringing  that feeling back.  It really is.  That was the goal  when we got into this thing.  We saw something special  in this thing  and being the huge  fight fans that we were  I just looked at all  these things that I thought  boxing did wrong  and basically  boxing got greedy  just like we were talking  about A-Rod  and all these baseball players  man, you get to this point  where you just get so greedy  and it becomes so much 
[03:41:00]  about money  you forget about the fans  you forget about  what the sport is really  all about  you forget why  you're doing it  to compete  and to win  and the glory  and all the things  that are great  about competition  and that's what we did  want to bring back  and it means a lot  thanks for saying that.  Oh no, without a doubt.  Jimmy, facing Ali  that's it.  Yeah, this is definitely  different.  Facing Ali.  These are all the guys  this is how  they took a certain  amount of the guys  that have fought  Muhammad Ali  and they talk about 
[03:41:30]  how it changed their life  fighting Muhammad Ali  what it did to their life.  Ken Norton  he had a heart attack recently.  Did he really?  Yeah, it was in the paper  the other day.  Ken Norton broke Ali's jaw  and the scary part  was to watch  for him  demolish him.  Yeah, the King Kong  the Gorilla in Manila  yeah, he was rough  on Frasier.  That's it, they just said  there, he called him  Uncle Tom  he was calling him  an Uncle Tom  and things like that.  Fucking Frasier  Foreman 
[03:42:00]  God damn  I can't wait to see this.  That looks great  I love Dick Sadler  fucking Foreman's  Foreman's trainer  he's this weird philosopher  Remember when Foreman  came in and shaking  that fucking meat hand  to his?  Yeah.  His hand  Huge  Ridiculous giant hand  It's like we're not  it's like when you look  at the species  as humans  that's my competition  on the genetic scale  to procreate  with the female  Right  Thank God for humor  They just showed something  that just shows you  how big boxing was 
[03:42:30]  back in the day  as we like to all say  Frank Sinatra  taking pictures  ringside  and I think he was  doing it for Time Magazine  or something  he was doing a little  he got Frank Sinatra  to take pictures  I forgot what fight  was it Ali Frazier  I think?  It must have been right?  I don't remember either  But there's Frank Sinatra  ringside taking pictures  like a fan basically  even though he was  working for Time  It was also  they showed the  who is the British  because they said  Ernie Shavers  was one of the  hardest punchers  in the 70s  Shavers was an animal  And who is the  British guy  who Ali said 
[03:43:00]  hit him the hardest  he'd ever been hit  was a  British guy  Henry Cooper  I think Ali said  he hit him  he was hit hardest  by Henry Cooper  all the fighters  You guys can go  to Spike.com  and it's called  Facing Ali  they have the  trailer for it  on there  I really want  to see that  it is a similar  UFC vibe  you didn't think  of money  when you thought  of those guys  fighting  it didn't matter  how much  they were making  you didn't think  how much  they wanted  to be the best  you know what the reality is  when guys  were really fighting  like these guys  fought  you hope they made 
[03:43:30]  300 million  you know what I mean  you got your money's worth  when you put down  your money  and you buy a ticket  to go to the live fight  or you buy your pay per view  you want to see a fight  you're putting your money  down to see a fight  these guys today  in boxing  do everything they can  to avoid a fight  so they can get  to the next big paycheck  these guys fought man  these are the guys  that laid it down  for all of us  the reason that I'm  in business right now  is because of the  Ali's and the Foreman's  and the you know  the Marvin Hagler's  and guys like that 
[03:44:00]  that's the reason  that I'm here today  and boxing just  isn't like that anymore  now are they saying  that fighting Ali  changed their lives  in a good way  or a bad way  or possibly both  different  some were positive  some were negative  obviously the Frazier thing  was really negative  because Frazier was the man  and Frazier was there  during that time  when Ali was gone  he was the champion  and then he came back  and was calling him  the Uncle Tom  and you know  he's not the real champion  I am  and saying all these  negative things about him  and Ali was just so  he just had this charisma 
[03:44:30]  and personality about him  he turned everybody  against him  speaking of Frazier  we got the voicemail  that Jimmy was referencing  you want to hear it  yeah yeah  Dana's got to hear this  this is from his  outgoing voicemail message  yeah  listen to this  my name is  smoking Joe  Frazier  sharp as a razor  yeah  it feels like  the butterfly  things like  to me  I'm the man  and the job  you know  look and see  call me  bye bye  he's still obsessing  I'm the man 
[03:45:00]  who done  I'm the man  who done the job  look and see  yeah  and then he says  call me  call me  not to be technical  Joe  but that's how  I heard this  you know  if you want to  harp on mental  capacity commission  yeah  I guess that's  I guess that's  the way  very good Jimmy  but all those  years later  he's still so  the humiliation  Ali put him  through  Frazier's documentary  I'm going to tell you  and I love Ali  but that really  turned me around a little bit 
[03:45:30]  right  turned you around a bit  it made you see  that Ali was just a man  and he really did have  a very very  aggressive  unpleasant side  just like every other  person does too  it really humanized Ali  but not in a very  in a good way  but you know  it's who he was  he was a man  yeah and listen  what you got to understand  too is at that time  nobody had ever seen  anything like that  this guy went out  and promoted  he promoted fights  he took the fight game  to a whole nother level  and as much as  Frazier hates the things  that he said  and everything else  Ali made Frazier big  and Frazier made Ali big 
[03:46:00]  I mean  it took  it takes two guys  to make a great fight  and you know  he was a great promoter  he'd go out there  and sell a fight  oh yeah  interviews with Howard Cosell  and all that  crap back and forth  exactly  no one did that before  nobody  we're getting a  I'm told Dana has to go  Dana has another  probably another  busy  yes  let's promote  everybody wants to talk to you  I think we got to most of it right  yeah  fuck the listeners right now  exactly  all they're going to do  is spoil our fun  and ask smarter questions  than we did 
[03:46:30]  you know  you were totally wrong about her  humiliatus  well we didn't ask about  how's Tito's training going  it's going good  I saw him recently  and he said  his back is 100%  feels great  he's training  he's training hard  so  it's going to be interesting to see  when does he fight  he fights  it's a while still right  on the Brock  no  he fights on the Brock Lesnar card  November 21st  wow  yeah it's Lesnar, Carwin, Ortiz and Coleman  Vegas right  Vegas  you guys will be there  fucking yeah  yeah that's a great fight man  watching a UFC fight live
