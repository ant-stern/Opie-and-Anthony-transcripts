<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton introducing themselves with characteristic self-deprecating and vulgar humor, referencing their controversial past.  The show immediately launched into a diverse range of topics. Anthony discussed the listener response (and encouraged further parody versions) to his embarrassingly earnest 80s power ballad, "Dara."  The hosts then turned to the violent Egyptian protests, specifically focusing on Mubarak's refusal to step down and the government's brutal response, referencing specific violent incidents depicted in video footage. Jim Norton reviewed *The Town*, praising Ben Affleck's performance, but also recounted negative backlash to his positive review, leading into a broader discussion about overly emotional reactions to movie opinions.  The hosts then previewed their upcoming interview with Ray Kurzweil, debating the plausibility of his predictions about nanotechnology, computer integration, and immortality as presented in *Transcendent Man*. They were then shown a pornographic video featuring a woman wearing an Opie and Anthony t-shirt, reacting with a mixture of shock, amusement, and crude commentary.  The Super Bowl received brief, unenthusiastic mention, followed by a discussion of a particularly violent and high-scoring hockey game between the Bruins and Stars, with audio clips played.  The hosts heavily criticized Mayor Bloomberg's fiscal policies, particularly his use of taxpayer money on chefs at Gracie Mansion while he lived elsewhere, and his stance on term limits.  They then discussed a screening of a new Adam Sandler romantic comedy, noting Brooklyn Decker's upcoming appearance on the show.  Throughout this section, the hosts consistently used highly offensive language, including misogynistic, racist, and homophobic remarks.

The next segment focused on Adam Sandler's "Just Go With It," fueled by promotional images.  The discussion devolved into crude commentary about the actresses' bodies and sexual activity, specifically mentioning Jennifer Aniston.  They extensively criticized various movie posters ("I Love Trouble," "Failure to Launch," "Pretty Woman," among others) using offensive language.  The hosts shared embarrassing personal anecdotes about romantic relationships.  The conversation then veered towards the Black Eyed Peas, focusing on Fergie's singing style (specifically a "Barracuda" cover), her perceived talent, and a crude anecdote about an alleged onstage urination incident. More discussion of movie posters, their aesthetics, and the hosts' opinions followed. This segment concluded with previews of upcoming guests, including Ray Kurzweil and clips from "My Strange Addiction" featuring a man obsessed with a sex doll, accompanied by further off-color banter about sex dolls and racial stereotypes. Kevin Nealon's cameo in Sandler's film was also mentioned.

A subsequent segment centered on a baseball pitcher's Hall of Fame chances, debating his merits and comparing him to other players, including specific win-loss records and World Series appearances.  The majority of this segment, however, focused on a highly graphic and vulgar discussion of a "My Strange Addiction" episode featuring "Dave Cat" and his sex doll.  The hosts reacted with disgust, amusement, and anger, providing detailed descriptions of the clips with extensive graphic sexual references and offensive commentary on Dave Cat's appearance and behavior.  They speculated about the doll's manufacturing process, using further vulgar language.  The hosts also reacted negatively to a therapist's interview with Dave Cat.  The segment concluded with additional commentary on Dave Cat and the absurdity of his situation. The final portion of this segment briefly covered personal anecdotes: one host throwing an iPad, another's late removal of Christmas decorations, and a modeling agency party.  This concluded with the arrival of Ray Kurzweil and mention of a Jennifer Lopez video and the hosts' reactions to it.

Ray Kurzweil, along with Barry Ptolemy (director of "Transcendent Man"), was interviewed.  The discussion largely focused on Kurzweil's predictions about technological advancements: artificial intelligence, life extension, and computing. Kurzweil discussed potentially resurrecting his deceased father using AI and his father's letters, music, and DNA. He predicted significant increases in human lifespan due to technological advancements in medicine. He described future technologies like nanobots enhancing human intelligence and immune systems, and the eventual human-computer integration.  He also discussed his personal health regimen of 150 daily pills. Other topics included driverless and flying cars, overpopulation, future computing interfaces, and the potential dangers and benefits of advanced technology. Ptolemy discussed the documentary's creation, including following Kurzweil for years.  A humorous anecdote about Ptolemy's work with Steven Spielberg on *E.T.* and the hosts' reactions to emotional scenes in the film were included.  The hosts' usual banter and off-color jokes, including pornography and sexual innuendo, were interspersed throughout.

The final segment featured a live read for Vermont Teddy Bears for Valentine's Day.  The hosts struggled with the ad read, repeatedly restarting and making sexually suggestive and offensive jokes about the bear, grandmothers, and bestiality.  Jim Norton participated in the banter.  The hosts' confusion about whether the segment was live or pre-recorded contributed to the chaotic and comedic nature of the segment, culminating in Norton's departure. The segment was highly irreverent and sexually explicit.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  Here we go, here's the bit.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, the father.  I would love to say we have the best job in America.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  It could be the best thing ever.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  Out loud laughs.  How do we explain the show?  We should start there.  Oh, here it is.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show, a popular radio program known for its 
[00:00:30]  cream style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, shit.  This is a freak show.  Why would anybody want to come on this show as a guest?  Under the right circumstances, something weird could happen.  I don't give a fuck.  Laugh out loud funny.  Which I love.  That's what I love.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations and have even gotten their show  suspended from satellite radio.  Because when you listen to our show, you know what you get.  You know what we are.  Everything has to do with cock or balls.  No, the jokes all end up talking about cock and balls. 
[00:01:00]  You're a waste of life.  Fucking listeners, go fucking die.  Excuse me.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people.  Real excitement.  Wow.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, Friday.  Yay.  Woo.  Hey.  What's going on?  Oh, it's Friday. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  As is.  As.  Jesus.  I got a lot of tweets from people.  About the As Is band from the 80s that you were in?  Yeah.  About my wonderful song, Dara, that we played yesterday for my most embarrassing taped moment  in history.  And a lot of people said, oh, the song was stuck in my head.  They said it sucked and they hated it and wanted to kill me for it.  It was catchy.  But they said it got stuck in their head.  It had a hook. 
[00:02:00]  It had a hook, all right.  I think we got a pendulum situation on our hands.  What do you mean?  I think we got to get the lyrics out there and see if other bands want to give it a shot  like we did with Pendulum.  You think people are going to.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  People were tweeting me about it saying, look, give me the lyrics.  My band wants to give it a shot.  Oh.  So if you want to redo Anthony's old power ballad from 1982, I think.  Give you the lyrics.  Just fucking transcribe them.  Listen to the beautiful song.  Where is the beautiful song?  I have no idea. 
[00:02:30]  I'm sure we'll replay it this weekend as the best of O&A countdown or whatever the hell  it's called over the weekend.  That's all you have to do is listen to the words, man.  Yeah.  Listen to the words.  You'll hear it sometime this weekend.  We'd have a fine romance, as Jimmy frequently pointed out 800 times, much to my chagrin.  Right, right.  Listen to the words.  Write them down.  And then make your own version and send it into the show.  So, Will, you could get some exposure for your band.  That'd be great.  I'm really looking forward to maybe us hitting and taking off. 
[00:03:00]  Looking for many different versions of the song, too.  Yeah.  How about country?  How about hard rock?  How about one that's just not lousy?  That's impossible.  Remember Pendulum, though.  Yeah.  One version of Pendulum.  Holy shit.  Swinging back the other way.  People were kind of into it.  It swung back the other way.  I love the second version.  The guy did Rob, whatever it was.  Yeah.  You freaking zombie.  You got it on your iTunes, right?  Yeah, I worked out with it sometimes.  So, we'll see if they can do the same with Anthony's Dara song from Aziz. 
[00:03:30]  All right, man.  What's going on in Egypt?  It's all about Egypt.  They got the big protests.  This is a big day, though, right?  A lot of people are in their little liberation square.  Yeah.  Whatever the fuck.  I don't know what the Arab word is for it.  But they're there, and it just looks like something bad's going to happen.  There's too many people.  They're packed in.  And today is the day they're expecting Mubarak to leave, which ain't going to happen. 
[00:04:00]  Mubarak has said he can't.  He goes, I can't just leave.  Anyone who says I can just leave doesn't know how Egypt works.  Well, he's kind of right.  Yeah, you can't just leave.  I hate to say it.  The only reason he's right is because we've been saying it all week, who's stepping in?  Yeah.  They don't really have a plan.  No, there's no.  They know they want something different, but they don't have a main guy that goes, all right,  I'm the guy, man.  No.  Rally around me.  No post-Mubarak strategy there.  They definitely don't want that frigging Islamic brotherhood. 
[00:04:30]  Muslim brotherhood.  Muslim brotherhood going in there.  I think what's going to happen, he's going to stay until September.  And I hope all of corporate America is watching this.  Yeah.  Because you know how when radio guys get in trouble, they got like protesters on the street.  Right.  If Mubarak could survive this protest, then a dumb Asian group getting mad because we did  an Asian accent, we could ride it out.  Trust me.  Or Reverend Al.  Or Reverend Al.  Bringing a few people in front of a company.  Reverend Al's even better, right. 
[00:05:00]  That ain't going to freaking do anything.  We could ride it out.  Because that's what Mubarak's doing.  He's like, I'll just ride this out.  I've been around for 30 years.  Yeah.  People were on to his first scheme of sending the cops and military in regular clothes  to beat the shit out of the protesters.  That was kind of hack.  So they're on to that.  And now you notice that pulled back.  Yeah.  So what's he got up his sleeve now?  He's been a dictator for 30 years.  I don't think he's just going to leave peacefully.  He has a few tricks up his sleeve.  Yeah.  Form a military guy.  I mean, come on.  The trick is he's going to get in a tank and start just riding through the square there. 
[00:05:30]  Well, they're using other vehicles to just...  I haven't seen so many people run over.  Oh, my God.  Man.  You see the new footage of the fire truck?  Yeah, I saw the...  He's running some guy over.  It's amazing.  There's a few of those videos going around, right?  Yeah.  There's a...  Was that the diplomat car or whatever?  No, that was another one.  Yeah, that was another one.  Okay.  This morning they had a new clip.  Oh, I didn't see the one you were talking about.  Oh, they'll show it ad nauseum, I'm sure.  But it's a fire truck racing down the street, just plows some guy right over and keeps going. 
[00:06:00]  Unbelievable.  I'm on my way home.  I took a break from the coverage yesterday and watched The Town.  Finally.  Oh, yes.  I saw that.  I realized I'm way behind in movies because I had a kid this past year, but I'm getting  them all on Blu-ray and Roland's helping me out.  Yeah.  Damn, that town was...  God, did we talk about it when it was first out?  Yeah, I talked about it a little bit when I saw it.  I like the Ben Affleck in that.  The Ben Affleck.  He's a...  I shouldn't say never, but I'm not a huge fan of Ben Affleck, but... 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  He was great.  You know when he's good?  I think I'm becoming a fan of his work now.  He's good when he plays someone from Boston.  Yeah.  That's like...  Yeah.  I think because he's from Boston.  He does the accent.  He's got the mannerisms of the, you know, the town-y kind of fucking...  Right.  ...guy.  So when he's playing that working-class guy from Boston, he does a great job.  I think I've just about given up on people because...  People. 
[00:07:00]  I tweet that.  I saw the town.  Most people are like, yeah, man, wasn't that a good movie?  And I said...  And I said...  I thought it was shot beautifully, too.  It made me miss Boston.  Just the aerial shots and...  Yeah, it was really good.  It made Boston like kind of the character, one of the characters of the movie.  I like when they make a city a character in the movie.  And then there's always one ass...  How could you like that movie?  Oh, my God!  I go, sorry.  What did you like?  Caddyshack 2?  You fucking douche.  Yeah, I'm not talking about some lame-ass movie that's obvious that a lot of people hated.  Yeah.  You might not have liked it, and that's fine.  Like, this guy was shocked that I watched... 
[00:07:30]  That I liked it.  What do you like, Ben Affleck, you faggot?  Yeah, when most people would say, yeah, that was a pretty good movie.  Maybe not my cup of tea or whatever.  But they would go, yeah, that was...  Well, it was put together.  The story's good.  It didn't fall apart.  It was shot nice, a lot of action.  Yeah.  I'm sure the reviewers in general liked it.  And this guy, like, in shock.  I can't believe you liked something like that piece of shit movie.  It's just like heat.  They ripped off heat.  It really is. 
[00:08:00]  It's exhausting after a while.  It's not infuriating.  You're right.  Exhausting.  Because, like, name a movie that's obvious if you said, I liked it.  Caddyshack 2.  Yeah, then you could get beat up.  Caddyshack 2 is so funny.  Yeah.  Then it could be like, turn around and go, what?  Are you kidding?  Really?  Then you deserve a beating.  Yeah.  And, I mean, it's okay if this person didn't like it.  It's just how it goes about it.  Like, this over-the-top shock.  Like, oh, God.  Yeah.  The Pink Panther with Steve Martin.  Yeah, exactly.  It's like, oh, yeah, I loved it. 
[00:08:30]  It was great.  What?  And then, of course, you could go all in.  I thought Jeremy Renner was great in that.  Yes.  I did have problems with the town, but I thought it was shot really well.  What was your problem with the town?  I told that the third job was stupid.  Yeah.  When there was so much heat on the guys after the second one.  I'm like, there's no way that would happen.  Some of the writing.  I had problems with some of the writing.  Really?  In that it was, I thought it was, like, I didn't like the way they got certain information  out.  Like, when they went to, uh...  So you wrote me last night.  Oh, shit.  No, no, but I didn't dislike it. 
[00:09:00]  I thought the movie was pretty good.  I didn't love it, but I certainly didn't hate it.  Just certain things I thought that they got, the story was put together kind of, it could  have been written better, like, where it was, instead of like, oh, okay, they gave me  that information now.  It was like, with Precious, there were certain writing things I just didn't like.  I liked it.  I definitely, it held my attention all the way to the end.  Oh, yeah.  And because I have a kid, it took me three and a half hours to watch it, so...  Is that what happened?  I started, oh, my God.  That's one thing I'm not used to yet. 
[00:09:30]  Really?  Started the movie at six.  It ended at, honestly, even longer, probably quarter to ten.  Is it watch the movie or save your child's life?  Is that, like, what you gotta do?  You chase them around?  You watch the movie, and then your left eye is trained on him, and then, so now you're  missing the movie, so, like, fuck, I gotta rewind.  I guess subtitles are out of the question.  I did subtitles as well.  Oh, wow.  Which, yeah, my eyes are like, if you see, they're a little fucking kooky looking today.  One was looking this way, the other was looking that way. 
[00:10:00]  Nose in the middle going, what do you want from me?  The parents ought to stand out there.  Yeah.  Everything takes twice as long.  Everything.  But, but in the end, after three hours and 45 minutes, I really, really enjoyed the movie.  Well, you had to keep stopping it, right?  Yeah, I was hoping I could watch something else last night, but I guess not.  It wasn't in the cards.  I watched a documentary.  Which one?  Just on some kook.  Oh, the Kurzweil.  He's coming in.  Yeah, no, I know.  He's a very smart dude.  Well, I didn't agree with everything, but I thought he was, you know, he's probably 
[00:10:30]  Some of the stuff was kind of interesting.  What about, what are we talking about?  Trans, once again.  Transcendent man.  He's a transcendent man.  Transcendent.  And the main guy, the inventor and the futurist, Ray Kurzweil, is coming in today.  And he's a bore.  Yeah.  He really, his delivery is a little slow.  And long-winded.  It's literally sleep-inducing.  I can't recommend the movie, because I think it's a little slow.  But I think people will enjoy it if they're into that type of thing. 
[00:11:00]  If that makes sense.  And he is kooky.  But, and you're not sure if he has points.  Like, does he have valid points and shit?  And did he predict a lot of stuff?  Or was it just like, I mean, everybody through their life has said things like, yeah, but you  know, one of these days, this is going to happen.  And it does.  It doesn't make you a genius.  Well, his book, Singularity, did really well.  And you saw all the people that he's hanging with.  Yeah, a lot of celebrities.  He's got some credibility around this guy, but. 
[00:11:30]  And he's won science, he's won science awards.  Right.  And he's been pretty prolific in science since he was 14.  That footage they showed on the Steve Allen show.  Wasn't that crazy?  Yeah.  He was on the Steve Allen show as just a little, was he 14, Jimmy?  I want to say 14, yeah.  And he had a huge computer.  A little genius.  And the panel had to figure out what he did.  Was it, was it, what's my line?  No, it was.  I got a secret.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  I'll go with Paul.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  I got a secret.  I'll show you some.  Okay.  Uncle Paul plays that game. 
[00:12:00]  And the guy, and Ray is a 14-year-old.  He's on the piano playing, you know, obviously playing really well.  And then they had to figure out, well, okay, what is that about?  And then someone guessed that, you know, the music was made by a computer, which he did  at 14 in the 50s.  That is amazing.  Or maybe the early 60s.  I forgot the exact date.  That's fucking amazing.  And then they pull out the computer.  It's just as massive.  It looks, it's almost as big as a car.  It's like fucking.  Almost as big as a car.  Like a science fiction movie computer.  Like a Mini Cooper type of, or almost that big, I guess. 
[00:12:30]  With the computing power of not even a fucking iPhone.  That's what he explains in the movie.  He says, you know, our phones now do what computers did that used to take up rooms.  Yeah.  So, did you like the part where they talked about the AIs?  Artificial intelligence and the robots?  I did, yeah.  With the one guy from Hong Kong with the crazy eyes.  It looks like when he's not, you know, doing his research, he might be diddling.  The guy who's trying to build a brain for China.  He's in China, yeah.  Yeah.  His whole job is to build a brain for China. 
[00:13:00]  Build a brain for China.  He's doing research and trying to build a brain.  You know, he understands that it's not the easiest thing in the world to do.  He's not a cook.  That doesn't sound easy.  But he talks about the technology, and he says in the wrong hands, it scares the shit  out of him that people are working on these robots and stuff.  Yeah.  I think we're safe for a while.  Well, that's the point.  I mean, as you look at it today, yeah.  But, you know, you fast forward another 10 years, there's going to be some shit that we  don't even understand as we sit here.  I didn't agree when he said that things like rocks and trees will eventually become computerized. 
[00:13:30]  Like, I didn't agree with that.  That will never happen because there's no reason for it.  Right.  There will never have a reason to make rocks computerized.  By that time, we'll have already moved off this planet.  Isn't there some kind of technology, and I'm way out of my league, where they're like  seeding a city with computer chips to get all sorts of information?  Ooh, sounds frightening.  Does anyone know?  Maybe someone out there could help me. 
[00:14:00]  I'm into nanotechnology right now.  I like nanotechnology.  Does that mean?  I don't know a bunch of little things that work together.  You like nanopornography, too?  I like nanopornography.  Speaking of pornography, thank you, Kevin.  I saw what you tweeted.  Was it Kevin?  Kevin from Connecticut?  Kevin from Conn, the C-O-N-N.  If you go to his Twitter, he's tweeting hardcore porn today.  Ah. 
[00:14:30]  That's the one you saw as well.  Yes, yes, it's a girl, and she's a, it's a, you know, those big deep throat blowjob  chokey things.  And she's going to town, and she is wearing an Opie and Anthony shirt.  Oh, let's see her.  It's wonderful.  Yeah.  Where is this lovely gal?  Well, you know, could have gotten a better girl, I think.  But, you know.  Was she blowing him?  I don't know who she's blowing.  But I think I, I was able to take a quick look at it this morning. 
[00:15:00]  Are there two guys in the scene?  Yeah.  I think so.  There's two guys in there.  She's blowing two guys.  Oh.  Yeah.  And she's got a, she's got a classic Opie and Anthony t-shirt on.  Yeah.  The classic shirt.  One of the, one of the ones we made for the women.  Even though we know we don't have a lot of women listening to us.  Oh, there we go.  There it is.  What's that?  You saw this?  Well, no.  I mentioned earlier before the show where it probably came from.  Uh-huh.  I was right.  Is that where it is?  Okay. 
[00:15:30]  Let's play that.  Jimmy, look at this.  There she goes.  Facial.  Yeah, great.  Facialabuse.com.  In the free section.  This girl's wearing an Opie and Anthony t-shirt.  Oh, that's kind of cool.  Thank God my dad's dead.  Jesus.  This is a proud moment.  Is this?  I'm going to have to show the family.  Hey, look.  Even though that does, in a way, look like you when you were at AEF with the hair.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it's actually me.  It's terrible.  It's actually me and Anthony and what we do to our listeners. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, God.  Leave it on there for a second, Dan.  There we go.  Let's smack her.  Say yes or no.  She gave an uh-huh.  She knows how to communicate with a large cock in her mouth.  Yeah.  All whores have a game plan until I hit them.  Oh, shit.  She's getting beaten with a cock.  What's more degrading, that or her wearing our shirt?  The women's group subjected the shirt.  Yeah.  Is she going to choke? 
[00:16:30]  You about to cry, whore?  What?  No.  You about to cry, whore?  You could cry for me.  You about to cry?  It's the same speech we got signing our deal.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ah, yeah.  Uh-huh.  There you go.  Now they're just...  Oh, they're smacking her face.  They're not being nice.  Why can't they just be nice to the girl?  Fucking metal nice one.  Look, they're feeling her.  It's like, pull off that awful fucking shirt, you bitch. 
[00:17:00]  Proud moment for the show right here.  Sure is.  Did I just think, lucky girl, did I say it?  I think it's on it, but what are they doing?  He put his fingers around.  Making a puke?  His cock can't do it.  That's cheating, sir.  There's some tears of joy coming out.  Tears of joy.  Those are happy tears.  Why does a girl agree to do this?  This is nowhere near as bad as Max.  I think guys have to talk during it. 
[00:17:30]  It's like, dude, if I'm watching this, I'm beating off.  I don't want to hear your shitty quips.  Yeah, you whore.  It's like, yeah, keep talking.  I'm jerking it.  Wonderful.  Where's the rest of that clip?  What happened to it?  That's it, thank God.  Wow, it was great.  No money shot.  I wanted to see the load.  Like how it's minutes into the show and we're already watching hardcore pornography.  It's out there.  We live in a great time, people.  It's out there.  We're jolly green giants with porn.  Yeah.  These are great days, bros. 
[00:18:00]  Bros.  Great days, bros.  I just realized Hurt Locker guy was the guy in the town.  Holy shit.  I just made that call.  Do you remember her?  Yeah, you said his name earlier.  Hurt Locker guy.  This is how stupid I am.  I'm watching the town going, how do I know that guy?  And I love the Hurt Locker.  I hate when that happens.  Because he wasn't wearing the suit.  Probably.  You know, the big Hurt Locker suit.  Yeah, he looked a lot thinner.  He was nominated for the town.  Was he?  And he's in Mission Impossible 4, I think.  Oh, he was in SWAT. 
[00:18:30]  Okay, that's right.  Thank you.  Yeah, he was in SWAT, the movie.  Yeah.  Yeah, the bad guy.  He usually plays like the bad guy or the asshole guy out of a group or something.  I think he's pretty good, though.  Yeah, he's a good actor.  He's pretty good.  Damn good.  Absolutely.  Did you like anything about that movie with Ray Kurzweil?  Oh, you could call him Ray.  I actually like the...  But you doesn't have to call him crazy.  No, you doesn't have to call him a boring speaker.  Do you agree with electrodes and stuff that are going to be implanted in our brains to have the Google and all that shit? 
[00:19:00]  Yes.  I actually said that a long time ago.  I said that currency will go away.  That eventually you just swipe yourself as you go through.  It'd be even easier to have all your personal information just on a chip.  What's that?  How would you put in the amount?  It'll probably be all...  I don't know exactly.  I mean, but if they can do that, if they can get your body and work out that biotechnology, that type of stuff, they'll easily be able to work out.  Yeah.  I'm sure.  I think that we're all going to have, I don't want to say the word, implants in us.  Yeah, but it won't be bad. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  There's no doubt that every single person will be tagged with something.  Yeah.  And it will be like...  I heard when they were looking to go to Mars, the problem with long-term space exploration is that if you get sick, if you develop cancer,  it's three years before you get where you got to go or two years before...  You're in trouble.  Yeah.  So you have to have somebody inside of you that can constantly check on you and constantly check on you and fix problems as you go.  So if it sees cancer cells, it can eradicate them before anything happens.  Because you're three years into a space flight, you're not done.  You can do.  And you believe in the computers as tiny as blood cells. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, without a doubt.  Yeah, I believe that part of the movie as well.  Without a doubt.  What about him bringing back his dead father?  No, not in any way, shape, or form.  But what about bringing him back in a way that he remembers with technology?  He means figuratively, I think, more than literally.  I don't know.  Obviously not a physical being, but with a program online, possibly maybe an AI that obviously doesn't look like his father,  but has all the memories.  You know what I mean? 
[00:20:30]  It's what he remembers his father being.  Well, if we can figure out a way to copy memory, we don't even know exactly what a dream is yet.  Like the one guy said something good.  He said we haven't even learned to walk yet when it comes to our brains.  We don't know.  Yeah, yeah.  The human brain, you can't replicate it, obviously.  And we don't even know how a lot of it works.  So how do you then duplicate it?  It's impossible to – because you have – it's that little divine spark thing that we can't quite get a hold on. 
[00:21:00]  And, you know, we all – it's all the same goop.  It's all the same cells.  It's all the same goop.  But you're different than me.  And you have different thoughts.  But it's the same hardware.  It's the same fucking hardware.  But the programming is different.  But we don't even know how a brain is programmed and what makes you you and me make – no one knows.  How can they – that's exactly it.  How can they replicate, if you want to call it a soul, like the essence of what makes you you?  Like, you know, those little things that make you laugh? 
[00:21:30]  Like stupid things.  Like somebody will do something and your friend is like, eh.  The look, eh.  Yeah.  That's the type of shit that's like that's what makes you you.  And that's the hard stuff that you write down.  Yeah, how do they get that into an AI?  Intuition.  Thoughts are just a hunch.  You could have an AI already play chess and all that stuff.  But as far as like – and you were talking about the essence.  Yeah, how are they going to figure that out in the future?  They say a thinking computer.  They have computers that can problem solve and almost independently think. 
[00:22:00]  But it's based on programming that has to be put in by a person.  It isn't pure independent thought where the computer could all of a sudden tell the programmer, you know what?  Like, fuck you.  Don't touch me.  Right.  I'll do this myself.  Right.  Now that would be – that's the moment.  That's the tipping point when a computer goes, hey, go fuck yourself.  That's what the guy in Hong Kong actually was, right?  It wasn't China.  It was Hong Kong, wasn't it?  Or is he in China? 
[00:22:30]  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, he is in China.  Is it matter?  Does it matter?  But that's what he's scared about when they become aware.  Skynet.  When they become aware.  Right.  Stupid Arnold.  Yeah, there is a – that is a problem.  As a governor when he could have been making a whole lot of movies.  Look, it's hard because we live our lives day to day and the technology is kind of in front of us.  And even though some people say it's moving, you know, quickly at this point, you don't really see it that much in your day to day.  You know what I mean?  But also when you take a chunk of time and let's skip ahead five years, the shit that's going to be around is going to blow us away. 
[00:23:00]  Because it does – he was right too about how it does – it continually gets faster and faster and faster and faster than knowledge.  Yeah, we all have our cell phones and, you know, we go back to the day I brought in my Pebble and everyone laughed at me.  But at the time, the Pebble was this cool-looking phone.  It didn't really do much.  I'm not going to try to oversell it.  It was just more of a sleek-looking thing.  But I remember everyone going, wow, that's different.  Yeah.  That was only – we were back in radio already.  That was only five, six years ago. 
[00:23:30]  And it couldn't tweet.  It couldn't fucking watch videos.  It couldn't do anything.  But we're all like – that day anyway, we're all like, oh, wow.  Now, fast forward the five years like I just said and look at us on our BlackBerrys and our iPhones doing all sorts of shit.  Yeah.  That's only five years ago.  I know.  Amazing.  You had that dumb phone where you could watch a little TV?  Yes.  And you thought you were like in the future, right?  The screen had to be one inch by one and a half inches. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  And I was able to watch Fox News on it and a few other channels live streaming.  And, I mean, now, obviously, you're like, oh, what?  Who cares?  Right.  But then it was – I was fascinated by this thing.  So that's what I believe as far as the movie goes where the technology is really starting to move around.  But still, I don't think we actually could grasp that because – you know what I mean?  We're just assuming these cell phones are out forever.  But it's only been five years with this.  Yeah.  Four.  We're silently communicating, though, with a little brush of the hand. 
[00:24:30]  It's weird.  Yep.  So, like, you would have said, like, if you could just – people just communicating in the room silently without writing it down.  I mean, there's a huge –  How about you – you're talking about –  I ran out of steam on that thought, by the way.  There's a huge – dot, dot, dot.  There's a huge cock in my face.  Yeah.  Yes.  Huge turd on my shoe.  Yes.  How about implanting things in your hands and other places on your body where if you shake somebody's hand,  you instantly exchange information about who that person is. 
[00:25:00]  Now, you might say, all right, that takes away from the sitting down and learning what people are about.  But in some situations, you don't have time or it's a business relationship.  But now you instantly have the information you need about this person.  You know if he's been arrested.  You know his –  Not necessarily.  Just his basic makeup.  I would guess that you would be able to control the info that you – 
[00:25:30]  Exactly.  At first, anyway, that you decide –  You know what?  Kind of like your Facebook, even though you're putting a lot of shit out there right now.  But kind of like your Facebook, you're kind of keeping some stuff from people, right?  Yeah, yeah.  So you would have that loaded into your hand like you're saying and then –  You could do it with the phones, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You could switch a –  Bump.  You could bump.  I got the bump.  I got the bump.  Did I say –  We bump every so often and trade a – you know, you trade a picture or something like that.  Yeah.  Hong Kong is in China.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sorry about that. 
[00:26:00]  That was me.  No, people are mad that I said Hong Kong and Japan or –  Really?  It's in China.  I'm sorry.  Oh, don't sweat it.  Relax.  Relax.  You're going to be okay.  We're very fucking tricky with Asia.  Rob, you're going to be okay in Michigan?  You're going to be all right?  You're going to be able to go about your day?  Is this –  That I corrected myself.  Do you know, I actually –  The Clip in Minority Report where the ads are being played as he passes by certain virtual billboards and advertisements.  And this they're already looking into.  Oh, sure.  They already have a little bit of this.  They already have a little bit of this where you walk by a certain kiosk, advertising kiosk, and it's custom made for what you enjoy. 
[00:26:30]  But how is it – how are they doing it?  How is that done these days based on –  Cry through car.  I'd have to look at it.  Auto information.  Or it is just weird.  Isn't it your auto?  The car you're driving?  Really?  Yeah, if it's billboards and the turnpike and parkway or whatever, yeah.  Oh, that could be – how about your phone though?  Like information on your phone?  If you don't turn off a certain thing, it would just no – 
[00:27:00]  Or how about face recognition?  We're pretty much all tagged anyway.  We got our phones in our pockets moving around.  Yeah.  We're pretty much – we're seeing the beginning of tagging with our phones.  If you for a second don't think – like I have the location thing turned off on my camera on my phone, yet when I downloaded it with a certain program, it told me exactly where the picture was taken.  Of course.  So it didn't put it out as information, I guess, when I upload the picture, but it's there. 
[00:27:30]  It knows where I took my pictures.  Well, we're going to be talking to Ray Kurzweil today, the inventor and futurist.  He's a big fucking deal.  He's a big deal.  He likes his pills every day and not the recreational ones.  What kind does he take?  Vitamins?  Dude, this guy, they showed a montage of him all day long.  All day long, he's just popping pills.  200 a day.  200 a day.  What are they? 
[00:28:00]  He doesn't do it in one sitting.  They showed the stacks of pills, you know those pill fucking cases?  Yeah.  Just piled.  And they're deep because every day he needs a lot of pills.  What are they?  Well, he's trying to reprogram his DNA in a way or whatever it is, like, to not age.  So he's taking...  He's trying to stay alive long enough so the technology catches up where he can be immortal.  Oh.  That's his goal.  The problem with him is it's too late for us, too.  I'm not going to even fucking front, but he's in his 60s. 
[00:28:30]  He doesn't have a shot if you believe that we could get to a point where people could live a lot longer.  Is he in his 60s?  Oh, yeah, he is.  He looks good.  We talked yesterday about the vastness of the universe and how it freaks you out and things like that.  And when you're a kid and you become aware of these things, I thought, like, when I became aware of my own mortality,  the only way I was able to talk myself out of, like, the little freakouts you'd get was the fact that I'm like,  oh, my God, it's like I'll be, you know, a certain age by a certain day. 
[00:29:00]  It's going to be in the 2000s.  Oh, Jesus.  I go, by that time, they'll probably have some kind of thing that you'll be immortal.  And then you reach it now.  It's 2000 fucking 11.  And it's the same shit.  We have great computers and technology and the cars look great and a lot of conveniences.  The cars look better, but they're doing pretty much the same shit.  But the basic shit?  Pretty much.  Our medicine is better, so we're living longer.  But it has nothing to do with these really amazing things with reversing aging or something. 
[00:29:30]  It's just we're getting better at surgery and detecting illness.  Well, Ray says that, you know, the life expectancy is going to start speeding up.  A year every year or something?  A year every year or something like that.  A year a year?  Yeah.  Yeah, so right now it's in the 70s for guys, I guess.  Yeah.  The evil age for guys is 74, 75, man.  That's when the big turning point happens.  Like clockwork.  Hit the wall?  Do your own research.  Look in the paper. 
[00:30:00]  All the guys are 74, 75.  Oh, boy.  By the way, Hong Kong is an island off China, so they're still arguing the Hong Kong thing.  Yeah.  It's my little slip up.  And when you say Hong Kong.  It's its own fucking thing.  Hong Kong is owned by China now.  But when you said it was Japan, I was like.  I don't know.  Did I even say.  Yes.  If I did, I apologize.  No, no, but I'm like, I know that's wrong, but I'm like, then I doubted myself.  I'm like, am I wrong?  Yeah.  You know, you hear something you know is wrong and you're just too much of a coward to say.  Just say Asia.  Somewhere in Asia.  I always get confused because I think China is a shithole. 
[00:30:30]  So Hong Kong is always beautiful in movies.  So I go.  Tokyo is Japan.  Yeah.  I go.  Oh, that's got to be the other great city of Japan, Hong Kong.  What happened?  Some guy was looking at his fucking iPhone or whatever it is and walked right off a fucking  subway platform.  Oh, no, no, no.  The train platform.  No, that's a better story.  The guy was playing a game.  Oh, he was playing a game?  Yeah.  That video is everywhere.  He's playing a game.  He walked right off a train platform.  Well, fuck him.  What an idiot.  No, we should make a law.  Make a law.  Yes.  To protect you.  Make a law. 
[00:31:00]  Law must be made.  How about this?  Hey, asshole, pay attention or you're going to walk in front of a train.  You can't look at any smartphones or anything a thousand feet from a train platform.  Meanwhile, the person standing against the wall waiting for a train is fine because he's  not walking toward the platform.  He's smart.  You joke, but that's probably a law they're working on.  Speaking of Bloomberg, who's an asshole, front page of the paper today, you know how  this guy is going, you know, we got tough times ahead of us.  We got to cut everything and everyone's got to do their part, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:31:30]  The city's in trouble.  Yeah.  Turns out they did a little investigating on our mayor here in New York City.  We talk about our mayor because I know your mayor is probably just as bad.  This fucking guy.  Hard pressed to find it, believe me.  You think Bloomberg's one of the worst and Bloomberg fucking changed the law so he could  have a third term without going to a vote and then put it to a vote after he got elected  and said the people have spoken and repealed the three terms. 
[00:32:00]  Right.  So no other mayor can do it.  Meanwhile, if you would have put it to a vote beforehand, he never would have gotten  the third term because the people said we don't want that.  Right.  But he waited until after he pulled shenanigans to get his third term to put it to the people's  vote to repeal it.  So he didn't look like, oh, I'm taking it away now.  Yeah.  He's a fucking snake.  I can't.  I really do fucking hate Bloomberg.  Well, you know how we talk about how we pay our taxes and we don't understand why, you 
[00:32:30]  know, things are being caught.  Yeah.  You know, our fire department's being caught.  The police force is being caught.  They're, you know, they're cutting people from the school system.  You know the deal.  Yeah.  And we're like, that doesn't make sense.  We're doing our part.  You have to figure out how to, you know, use this money properly.  Do your part.  Right.  So a great story today.  They look in a fucking Bloomberg in his world.  He's got he's got three chefs.  Does he?  Three chefs.  It's the front page today.  He's got three chefs.  Hear me out on this one. 
[00:33:00]  At Gracie Mansion, where that's the place the mayors live here in New York City.  But Bloomberg is so goddamn rich.  He's like, I don't need your Gracie Mansion.  I'm going to live in my awesome place on the Upper East Side.  Yeah.  They used to only have one chef.  He upped it to three.  It's about a quarter million dollars a year that the taxpayers taxpayers are paying us.  And he doesn't live there.  Yeah.  Isn't that brilliant?  And he's telling us, you know, there's tough times ahead.  We're all going to have to fucking make some sacrifices.  When this guy can't even make his own fucking sacrifices. 
[00:33:30]  And that is taxpayer money, motherfucker.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Does he does he is it just one of those things that's there that he can't get rid of?  Well, no.  Well, the point is, I understand one.  He upped it to three.  Oh, he upped it to three.  Yeah.  There was always one.  And then he upped it to three, even though he doesn't live there.  He doesn't live there.  He goes there probably for some functions here and there.  He is just despicable, man.  Yeah, he is.  Someone really ought to I would someone should just investigate the fuck out of him. 
[00:34:00]  Go deep inside every stinky crevice on on our mayor and see what shenanigans he's up to.  I hate this guy.  I like a couple of things he's done.  But that arrogant fucker that he is.  I hated the fact that he put those faggot potted plants in and that he and that he gave himself a third term.  He really is just a twat.  He's a twat.  And that's the guy that didn't want Giuliani.  Oh, yeah.  No, democracy has to continue. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  But I guess not when you're there.  After 9-11, it can continue.  But not when when you think there's a fiscal crisis.  And he said he went for the third term because there was a fiscal crisis and he's the best man suited to take care of it.  So that's why he's going to run for a third term.  Meanwhile, right after 9-11, Giuliani was doing a great job with everything from morale to rebuilding security, everything.  The guy was doing a great job as mayor.  People felt comfortable with him in there after 9-11.  And Bloomberg's big selling point was, hey, you know, democracy must go on. 
[00:35:00]  We must not interfere with the election process.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  How about you did it?  Yeah.  I cannot stand him.  He's got the three chefs.  Good for him.  Just kind of going through what's going on out there.  Super Bowl, man.  I'm not even feeling it.  You guys feeling it at all this year? 
[00:35:30]  No, it's too fucking.  I like the Egyptian Bowl better.  That one's really, like, taken off.  People are having fun.  The Packers is currently favored by two and a half points is the headline today.  Go Pack Goal.  And it starts 6-30 on Sunday, which means it won't end until 11-30.  So the cheeseheads are all going to be out in force, eh?  Not necessarily.  They get some of the tickets.  Yeah.  That's what I always hate about the Super Bowl.  You're a diehard fan.  And then it's tough to actually get a ticket to go down there because of all the corporate sponsors and everybody else. 
[00:36:00]  Corporate slobs.  I don't know how they divvy it up, but the percentages are pretty weak, man.  The amount of tickets they actually, you know, save for the team's fans.  Oh, in the Super Bowl?  Yeah.  I guess we'll just have to wait.  I think we did it last year, and it was pretty amazing.  How many tickets that they got?  It's probably fun down there.  It's actually five tickets are left for fans.  Probably fun down here.  Look at this place.  It's a ghost town.  We're basically the only ones that aren't there that have a name in this fucking company.  Yeah. 
[00:36:30]  We're basically the only ones.  They're all down there.  All the management, the executives, all the shows.  We are scum.  Maybe Travis can help me out with this.  Greatest start to a hockey game happened last night.  Greatest start to a hockey game.  My Twitter went nuts, and then I tried to find the game, and I couldn't fucking find it.  It was the Bruins versus the Stars, and there were three fights in the first four seconds 
[00:37:00]  of the game.  And then I think there were...  Does that happen?  And I didn't get to see the game, so someone could correct me.  I think there were two goals within the first two minutes after that.  Yeah.  That could be the greatest start to a hockey game ever.  That is a good one.  How do you beat that?  Do you know how many goals were scored, Travis?  Travis is our hockey expert.  Well, I wouldn't say expert.  Go Habs.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Well, you know.  I like Travis's comebacks to things.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, you know.  It's like, what are you going to do?  What are you going to do? 
[00:37:30]  What do you want me to say?  No.  No Habs.  So, I couldn't find the game, so all I got on Twitter that there were a lot of fights  within seconds of the game.  So, there were three fights in the first four seconds?  Three fights in the first four seconds.  The puck dropped.  They started fighting.  Why don't they fight before the puck drops?  Etiquette?  I don't know.  Is it etiquette?  Is it those weird, like...  I think so, yeah.  I think it's like, let's get the game going.  And then we'll do this?  And then we'll fight.  So, the puck happened.  Two goals, three fights, and one goalie pulled all within one minute, 20 seconds.  Yeah. 
[00:38:00]  That's the greatest start to a hockey game.  Prove me wrong today.  Prove me wrong.  That's great.  How the fuck do you beat that?  That's a good one.  Two goals, three fights, and a goalie pulled within a minute and 20 seconds.  One shooting.  That'd be a great way to start a hockey game.  That's a good one, too.  Guy takes a drop of a deuce on the ice.  Everybody eats it.  Like a bunch of hungry dogs.  So, puck drops.  They start fighting.  They break that up.  Then what?  They drop the puck again, and then...  And immediately start fighting again.  Other guys start fighting. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Because the ones that started the fight, they're already off the ice.  And then, what?  A third time, same thing?  Yep.  Round one.  Oh, we got highlights?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  So, that's the start of the game.  So, that's the start of the game.  They wait until the puck is dropped.  They go at it.  Oh, yeah.  They're fighting.  It really feeds Campbell's lunch here, you see.  Oh, look at the blood.  Oh, wow.  Right on, man.  Right away, a couple seconds later, John Thornton has to regain the momentum of this game.  One second later.  He has to regain the momentum of this game.  He has to regain the momentum of this game.  He has to regain the momentum of this game.  He has to regain the momentum of this game.  He does it with Barts.  These two guys are good scrappers.  Oh, and you see.  Oh, my God.  He's got to do it one second.  Thornton's an animal. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, he pounded that motherfucker.  Thornton's an animal, man.  Excellent, excellent.  And then round three.  It was round three.  We're four seconds in.  Now, Sotheby's for Dallas is trying to get the momentum back from the Boston Bruins.  So, he goes right away with the play.  Oh, shit.  Let's square it off.  Why wasn't this on TV?  The Boston Bruins.  McQuaid almost puts him down.  Oh, man.  Okay, he's down.  So, the Bruins now are 2-1 in the fights.  And all the momentum right now are the Boston Bruins' way.  And the building is unbelievable.  And you're absolutely right because 30 seconds in.  And here's Milan Lucic finally breaking out with a big offensive season. 
[00:39:30]  And then 35 seconds of the game is the first goal.  It's Bergeron who had two goals and an assist.  So, 120 in.  And then 120 in is your second goal.  Excellent.  And that's exactly what Boston wanted to do.  These two teams are fine.  And then it goes back to a regular hockey game, basically.  I think it was six fucking felons.  I just can't.  Boston won.  I know that.  The fact that there's only occasionally, like, one.  There's a lot of one-nothing games.  I just wish I could enjoy hockey more. 
[00:40:00]  There's more than one-nothing games in hockey now.  Ah, here's the ice.  Too much guys skating and the puck is gone already.  You can always use more scoring.  But they get a bunch of goals now.  I like when you get a good hockey announcer, that kind of makes it.  I don't know how they do it.  Even when they don't score.  Like, when there's a play right in front of the net and shit's going on.  You're like, shot, so stick save.  And you're like, holy shit.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, they can really make it exciting. 
[00:40:30]  Hockey is an exciting game to watch, even if the score is low.  As long as there's a lot of shots on goal and shit.  I would fuck that up so.  The guy's going down.  He's skating around the corner.  Ah, the puck's over there now.  Everyone's going that way with the stick.  Ah, the guy hit it.  It has to be the toughest game to call.  I would say for a sports guy, that has to be the toughest fucking game to call.  The puck moves so fucking fast.  It's my favorite sport to watch live.  Baseball's easy.  They talk about fucking their lives.  Yeah.  It's like, yeah, we were out to dinner last night. 
[00:41:00]  Had a great steak over there.  That Morton Steakhouse.  What a great, great dinner I had with my wife.  That one high and wide for ball, too.  They just throw the plays in the middle of the conversation.  It doesn't matter.  But hockey, like, that guy can't fucking do anything when there's action happening.  How do you know the players?  I would have to pick my nose somewhere.  Basketball seems hard, too.  I think that's the second hardest after hockey because the teams are constantly in motion. 
[00:41:30]  Football, at least, there's a complete stoppage every...  You know what it is with basketball, though?  That fucking basketball is not moving as fast as that puck.  True.  The puck can fly off of people's sticks.  And he's talking about how it's passed, who it's passed to, what the guy's doing with  the puck when he gets it.  And then they all got fucked up names.  Let's not forget that.  Yeah, that's true, though.  Half the names.  I'm a hardcore Islanders fan.  I still can't pronounce half the guys' names.  Shoulder to shoulder, their fucking names on the back. 
[00:42:00]  With all consonants.  With consonants and combinations that you've never seen before that just make your brain  very uncomfortable.  Yeah, that's rough.  You've got to give those guys a lot of credit.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Oh, I would just be all over the jert.  Doing it raw.  The jert.  Oh, the pucks.  I like the pucks over there.  Yeah.  And again, and it went behind the net and everybody's ices all over the place.  Everybody's slipping.  Ah, he missed. 
[00:42:30]  Ah, the stick hit it.  Wait, wait, I'm sorry.  Ah, that wasn't him.  That was him.  Puck's over there now.  That was him.  Let's just be an asshole.  Yeah, you had no names, nothing.  Ah, shit.  Yeah.  Egyptian, uh.  Egyptian.  Someone raised a point.  Maybe it was me and my dream.  But if it's a democracy, they're going to elect people who don't like the West, I'm sure.  Yes.  Well, that's a whole thing that they're saying.  So I guess we have to let that happen.  It's not our business.  We want to control democracy.  We're talking about this open, free democracy that they should have. 
[00:43:00]  But here's the other thing we're talking about.  We don't believe that.  No, we like the right democracy.  We like to put that message out there, but we want the right democracy, of course.  Here's what it is, though.  You want to give the people the choice to choose their own leadership and their own future in their own country.  But when we speak of that, we also talk about things like the freedoms of basic human rights, the freedom, you know, our own rights to assemble, the freedom to speak openly if you have dissension against the government. 
[00:43:30]  And these radical Islamic groups that want to take control don't allow that.  So we can then speak out and say, no, we don't like that motherfucker in charge, because it's not like it's the right or wrong democracy.  That truly isn't a democracy.  It's just a changing of dictators because the people are still going to suffer under an Islamic fundamentalist regime. 
[00:44:00]  They're going to suffer.  They're not going to have the freedoms that they want.  Like these people in the square, but especially the young people, they want freedom to be able to express themselves and do things and make their own way in their own country.  That's not going to happen with a fundamentalistic Islamic regime.  And I think you kind of got an Obama situation here when Obama was becoming president, a lot of, you know, the change and all that.  Yeah, yeah.  And the people that really came out for that stuff really thought their entire existence was going to change if Obama was president. 
[00:44:30]  Overnight.  Remember we had that discussion?  I said it because you were like, you were so mad about the Obama thing.  I'm like, you got to relax, man, because most of those people are going to be highly disappointed.  Because what they're thinking this change means and the reality of it doesn't match up.  No.  And the same thing has happened in Cairo there in Egypt.  These people are convinced that the change is going to be just unbelievable for them.  But it'll get better.  But how much better?  Unless you get a Western-based democracy in there. 
[00:45:00]  Well, you're not going to get that right away.  I know.  No, that's just it.  You could change the direction of how they do things, but it's going to take time.  Free and open elections.  I mean, there's going to be all kinds of improprieties and cronyism.  And then that Muslim-Islamic brotherhood fucking don't talk about how moderate they are. 
[00:45:30]  Bullshit.  They're making statements already about going to war with Israel and killing Jews.  What happened?  I thought we were getting our Muslim Brotherhood t-shirts.  You're turning on me.  I thought we were all about the Muslim Brotherhood.  I'll wear the t-shirt.  On laundry day.  On laundry day.  You know, when I really get down.  Right after I wear out all my rock star t-shirts, that's when I'll start wearing the Muslim Brotherhood t-shirts.  Oh, did you see that 3D movie yesterday? 
[00:46:00]  It wasn't.  No, I saw...  God, now you put me in a bad spot.  Oh, Adam Sandler.  You know what?  I saw the new Adam Sandler movie, and there's a couple things.  Oh, Jesus.  And have at me, man.  Wait, wait.  Why?  It's a rom-com.  Oh, no.  Yeah, we had a screening because we might get some of the guys.  Nick, what's his name?  Pete Swartzen, yeah.  Fucking funny dude.  He's very funny.  Funny fucking dude.  It's a rom-com.  It's a date movie, and it was good.  Oh.  It was really good.  Oh, no.  Not really good.  I shouldn't say that because people are going to hold me to that.  All romantic comedies are not awful. 
[00:46:30]  It's what they've become that is fucking...  But just because something's a romantic comedy doesn't mean it's not going to be good.  And Andy Roddick's wife, holy mother of Jesus.  Whatever that means.  Yeah.  Holy...  You've seen the fucking commercial when she comes out of the water in slow motion in the  yellow bikini, right?  This girl is ridiculously hot.  Brooklyn Decker.  Brooklyn Decker.  Let me tell you that.  She's so hot.  Upper Decker.  I think Roland says she's coming in on Monday.  She's coming in.  That's what Roland says. 
[00:47:00]  Did we get any of this?  I got to ask you.  Was there any...  Well, I really like you a little.  I think, baby, me and you is going to be an item to give me...  Me and Roland were discussing the movie.  My take on Adam Sandler, he's made 36 movies.  Wow.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, there she is.  She's coming in Monday, which means we're going to have...  Oh, I know her.  I've gone out with her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, we had a marmalade...  Marmalade.  We shared a jar of marmalade with our fingers.  This interview is going to be a problem. 
[00:47:30]  Of course it is.  Because I am just going to fucking lose my shit.  Dude, why are you going to tell you have a nice house?  She'll say she has a bigger one.  I know.  It doesn't work with celebrity girls.  No, because they're rich.  And the stupid broad could...  She could act a little bit.  You know, within her range of what she was doing, obviously.  You know, it was a good romantic comedy?  She was the Sports Illustrated cover...  What year?  2010, last year.  Last year.  Oh, God.  I told you that.  Oh, my God.  Fucking Pretty Woman was a rom-com that was good.  Well, that was the old school rom-com... 
[00:48:00]  I'm saying there's some...  ...before they got that formula together.  Are there any good ones?  I guess as a shock jock, I'm supposed to beat this movie up, but honestly, it was all right.  It helped my attention.  The Adam Sandler, his movies have grossed $3 billion worldwide.  $3 billion.  $3 billion.  $3 billion.  $3 billion.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  Look at her snatch.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Good God.  Right through her yellow...  Look at the crease.  It's nice.  She has hips like a boy, though.  Jesus.  Nice straight hips.  Well, let me see.  Scroll down a little or up a little.  Who's that Woody from Toy Story's body?  Let me see. 
[00:48:30]  There's the hips, Jimmy.  Come on.  Just a little higher.  She's wearing the thing all low.  Yeah, she's wearing that very low on her thighs.  She could wear it low.  Yeah.  There's fucking...  You could totally see her pussy through there.  Tell fucking...  Tell a G.I. Joe fucking straight doll body.  Fucking hit the brakes.  This is what we do as guys.  Isn't it?  You find one dumb thing.  But honestly, the hips are right where they're supposed to be.  She's beautiful.  I'm kidding.  Oh, my God.  Let me see her face.  She looks a little like Amy Schumer. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  From that...  From Ackler, but she has an Amy Schumer.  Yeah, a sober Amy Schumer.  Yeah.  Without the...  Yes, exactly.  Without the alcoholism and caustic humor.  Without the bloated vodka face.  Yeah, and shitty, rotten things.  I bet Amy would be a fun fuck.  Amy, I'm so kidding.  I bet she'd be just a fun...  Amy is hot as hell.  I think Amy is probably dirtier.  No.  I don't look at her that way.  She's hot.  It's like I don't think she's hot.  You've got to see her in Cosmo spread.  I can't...  I've seen one.  I can't look at my friends like that.  I'm so weird.  Yeah.  Yeah, like friends...  You look at my dick in the fucking bathroom, though. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, but it's different.  It's because I've had it slapped on my face.  I never had Amy slapped on my...  But I feel...  Wow.  I feel guilty looking at friends, girlfriends like that, too.  Yeah.  And my female friends.  Yeah, man.  Yeah.  So I don't know why I had to see the movie for the show yesterday, but I guess because  we're going to get some of these people in.  Because it's not a movie for a hardcore audience.  Certainly some of the people that listen to us will go and see it, and they'll like it.  They'll probably go with their wife or girlfriend.  Yeah, they all got chicks.  And we've got women that also will do the thing with their female friends. 
[00:50:00]  But this is what I...  These pictures are ridiculous.  I mean, the vag bulge is not...  I'm going to say that to her.  I'm going to say, you know, despite the fact that your legs are one straight line up to  your ass, and I loved your movie, Hipless in Seattle.  There it is.  She's hot as fuck.  Yeah, she's ridiculous.  I don't find Adam Sandler funny, was my point I made to roll him, but he knows how to bring  people together around him that are really fun. 
[00:50:30]  All right, here's what I want to know.  Could you punch up...  Although I hate you navigating away from that site, because it is gorgeous.  Could you find me...  Not the trailer.  I want to see the movie poster for this movie, and then I could judge...  I could judge every romantic comedy by nothing more than the movie poster.  It's in all the subway stations, so I know how this is going to end.  All right.  Oh, really?  I don't think I've seen it.  Let's see.  Just go with it.  And Roland's outside the door.  Just go with it. 
[00:51:00]  Just go with his name of the movie.  Oh, fuck me running.  Let me see.  Don't even.  Don't even.  Let me get a good look.  And we'll describe it after...  Are we getting Adam?  Okay, here it is.  Just go with it.  Adam Sandler, Jennifer Aniston.  They're sitting on little foldy chairs on the beach.  Hawaii.  They're toasting each other with drinks, with tropical drinks.  Adam Sandler's smiling at her like, huh? 
[00:51:30]  Huh?  Huh?  And she's looking at him with a face like...  Huh?  Huh?  And there's a hot girl walking away.  in the background.  Is that Brooklyn Decker?  That's Brooklyn Decker.  Yes, yes.  Because just go with it.  I say.  That is your typical shit, no thought to it, rom-com fucking movie poster.  Rom-com.  That annoys the piss out of me.  I hate them all.  I hate them.  But at least it isn't...  There are two of them are back-to-back looking over the shoulder at each other with the guy 
[00:52:00]  going, huh?  And the guy's like, huh?  Uh-huh?  And the guy's like, dude.  Uh-huh?  And she's, uh-huh?  And he's, uh-huh?  Can we see I Love Trouble's movie poster?  Trouble.  I Love Trouble.  Wrong.  I Love Trouble.  He's one of the...  I used to have to run past that at Blockbuster because I couldn't bear to look at the fucking  Nick Nolte's stupid face.  Video box.  I Love Trouble.  I used to say, like, I Love Trouble.  Look at this.  Oh, God.  That is a fucking... 
[00:52:30]  That's horrible.  I Love Trouble.  That's not as bad as when they're back-to-back.  They weren't the same one that was shot.  The back-to-back ones are way worse.  But that's an old one, so that was like the beginning of the horrid video box covers.  Ashton Kutcher's are always hideous, too.  Oh, Failure to Launch.  With Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica.  She's pushing him.  He's on his heels, leaning back at, like, a 45-degree angle, and she's pushing him like  a hand truck.  Movie posters fucking suck.  They are horrid.  It wasn't a good movie, Roller. 
[00:53:00]  It wasn't a good movie.  Shut up.  It was.  Which one was?  No one saw that movie.  It got horrible reviews.  Why don't you try Failure to Launch?  He hissed at me.  He hissed at me.  I can roll and roll.  Roll and roll.  You're all right, man.  You're all right.  Matthew McConaughey, Jennifer Garner.  Ghosts of Girlfriend's Past looks horrible with her back-to-back.  Back-to-back.  And, of course, anything that's around the guy's neck that can be used for the girl to hold 
[00:53:30]  on to, to restrain him.  It is a virtual penis, is what it is.  And she is controlling his cock through neck attire in the poster.  What was the Pretty Woman movie poster?  Because that was what I liked.  Pretty Woman?  Oh, God.  It's probably not good.  No.  Movie posters are...  But before the...  That was a back-to-back.  Yeah, they were back-to-back.  Back-to-back.  Back-to-back.  And, actually, that shoot was very awkward because they are standing back-to-back. 
[00:54:00]  And let me see the poster.  Yes.  For which?  Yes.  For Pretty Woman.  Why was it awkward?  Well...  Why do I think this ends with a small animal?  I'm not even going to try.  I'm not even going to try.  Was it something about a gerbil?  Yeah.  You think the gerbil ended up in her hooker boots?  I think Julia kept going, like, oh, she got frightened because a little tail kept tickling 
[00:54:30]  her behind.  Well, the gerbil kept poking his head out and going, like, nibbling her backside.  And she said, hey, that's only my stunt double's ass, not mine.  Yeah, what do you think's...  This is a kind of zoo crew question, but the best movie poster.  Clockwork Orange is one of them.  Like a real good one?  I never even thought about it.  Clockwork Orange is an amazing movie poster.  Is there a site that has the best movie poster, so at least we have a place to start?  I'm sure there is.  Hey, getting back to this movie.  So, Roland saw it.  Did you like it?  I loved it.  You loved the movie yesterday.  Yeah, I loved it.  But you like rom-coms. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, I love rom-coms.  The soundtrack was good.  They used a lot of police and sting music.  Oh, God.  And a little Snow Patrol slash, I'm going deep now, police mashup, which I really, really  fucking like.  Do you cry at this?  No, it's just, I get really sweaty.  Danny, what Shawshank Redemption poster is that?  Because that's not the one we got here in the States, was it?  Well, I mean, they make up a couple of different ones, but that's definitely my all-time favorite  poster.  That is a great one.  That one, like, you could frame a fucking hang-up.  I want that frame.  If anybody out there has an original Shawshank, I want that frame. 
[00:55:30]  Tim Robbins, right after he comes out of that sewer pipe thing, and it's kind of done  very well with the rain on him, and his arms are spread apart, and that's great.  That's a good poster.  I love clockwork.  Even, I'll tell you, something that wasn't a lot of shit going on, but it was very mysterious  and kind of creepy was Alien.  Alien was good with the little glowing egg thing, and Alien written in that alien font.  Yeah, that was a cool fucking poster. 
[00:56:00]  When you saw that, you were like, all right, that's fucking cool.  The egg breaking open.  Yeah, that's fucking cool.  Godfather, but that doesn't really count.  It's in space, no one can hear you scream.  That was like, with a fucking, and that's, you know, 79, I guess, or whatever the fuck  it was.  Star Wars was a good one, right?  I mean, for what it was.  Star Wars was a little cheesy.  Was it?  The original one.  It was really weird.  It's got like Luke Skywalker holding the lightsaber.  It's cartoony, man.  Yeah.  Those are thousands.  I saw some, like, original Star Wars posters.  Those are fucking expensive.  And all you had to do was rip it off your local movie theater. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, I saw.  Because they didn't even protect them back then.  Well, they don't even now.  I saw a guy right by my garage.  I guess he really just had to have an Inception poster.  Just didn't even look around for anyone, cops, whatever.  Just walked right up, opened the case, because it was in one of those little plastic or  glass cases.  Just opened it up, rolled it up.  It's my mouth.  Nothing left.  The key to all that is, you've got to make it look like you're...  Like you belong.  Like you belong.  And no one was going to say shit.  It's the easiest thing in the world.  The garage attendant.  They were looking.  Everyone was looking at this guy.  He didn't give a fuck.  Because they assumed that that was his job. 
[00:57:00]  He was changing up the movie poster.  Oh, no.  I knew he was stealing that.  I just didn't give a fuck.  Jaws.  Jaws.  Jaws is a good one.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  That let you know exactly what the fucking movie was about.  Had a little sexy in it, because the chick was nude.  And she was going to die.  And that shark is just giant coming up to eat her in a split second.  That was good.  I'll give you that.  The original one with the little hat.  The hat.  The Dora.  Boo.  The Dora.  He's hissing there.  He's angry.  I will end you! 
[00:57:30]  Are we getting a lot of the stars of this movie in?  Yeah.  Just go with it or something like that?  Big stars.  We want Adam.  We want the Adam Sandler.  We talked to him years ago.  He hasn't done radio in a very long time.  I find him Monday.  No, who was...  Kevin Nealon was fucking hilarious.  Yeah.  He had a two, three-minute cameo that was really fucking funny.  And you know what?  You're going to kill me for this one, but that Jennifer Aniston is fucking hot.  She is.  I'm all in.  I'm all in again with Jennifer Aniston.  I saw... 
[00:58:00]  Are you ready for this?  Did her hotness take your mind off of the...  I know.  The aroma.  You've got to think she's got the smell of pussy like we've talked about for years,  because she doesn't have a man.  There's a scene in this movie where this Brooklyn Decker broad, who's ridiculously hot,  goes, I need to take a...  I'm not going to...  Who cares?  Oh, please.  Ruin it.  How about we ruin the movie?  Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler get together in the end.  Surprise!  Or do they?  Or do they?  Yeah, all right.  But there's a scene where she wants to cool off, so she takes off her shirt and her pants, 
[00:58:30]  and she's in the tiniest bikini and jumps in the water, right?  Yeah.  And all the guys in the movie and everywhere else, like, is holy shit, right?  Like J-Lo's ass walking by.  That type of fucking reaction.  Yeah.  And then the gag in the movie is then a few of the other people jump in, and then Jennifer  Aniston goes, well, I need to cool off.  And Adam Sandler, like, because she's supposed to be the frumpy assistant that he's had all  these years.  Yeah.  What, you're going to jump in with your shirt and they do the, and she pulls her shirt off  and drops her tiny little fucking, I think it was jean shorts. 
[00:59:00]  And she's all hot.  Dude, her body.  And she's 41, 42.  Ridiculous.  Yeah.  Fucking ridiculous.  Not a mark on it.  There's clockwork.  Right?  Right, Roland?  She is phenomenal.  Yeah, the clockwork poster's good.  That's a great one.  I have one with a little X rating on it.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You know, some now.  I forgot how good this.  Kill Bill was a great one.  Just this one.  Oh, oh.  It's just fucking Uma Thurman.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That was a good one.  That was all right.  The Birds. 
[00:59:30]  Pulp Fiction was a good one, too.  Cloverfield.  With Uma kind of laying on the bed with the little book.  Cloverfield was a great one, too.  Cloverfield was good.  Yeah, that was actually a good poster.  The Sex, Liberty, Beheaded.  Could have been a great movie.  I'd still fight for that movie.  I liked it.  I really liked it.  I liked it better the second time.  Remake it without the shaky cam or just knock that shit off.  Knock it down 50%.  You got a much better movie.  Oh, I do, yes.  I have an original Pulp Fiction movie poster.  Do you really?  Do you?  Yes, I do.  Guy who's jealous.  Do you?  I've got to have it hung up on my...  Because it looked like a pulp book. 
[01:00:00]  No, I know what they were going for.  Yeah.  I understand that, but...  Let me see it.  Oh, yeah, I was just going on.  That was a good one.  Yeah.  Uma with her Uma Pulp Fiction haircut.  I'm going to stalk her.  I liked her dumb haircut in that.  It looked like hot.  Oh, Tootsie.  Oh, Tootsie.  Tootsie, one of the greatest movie posters.  Oh, God.  Dustin Hoffman.  So not believable.  Midnight Cowboy was a good one.  That looked like a rom-com poster with two guys.  Rom-com.  Rom-com.  Rom-com.  American Graffiti was okay.  That was a little cartoony, that poster. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  So I didn't...  Yeah.  I want to see Outraging Bull.  Yeah, just dumb De Niro's face.  Schindler's List was great.  The two hands.  The hands with the little red that the girl was wearing.  Oh, I didn't go down.  Let me see that.  I didn't even...  Hell yeah.  And the list.  He's holding her...  How do you notice that?  Well, she didn't make the list.  Jesus.  No, she certainly didn't.  The clothes you made the list of nice things in a pile.  And that Royal Tenenbaums wasn't that great poster.  Come on.  Stop it.  The artsy, fartsy shit movies.  I didn't understand that movie.  I tried it twice, too.  I did, too.  Fuck you.  I tried it twice. 
[01:01:00]  What the fuck's going on?  Fargo.  And the Azuzu movie, too.  Whatever the fuck that one was.  With Bill Murray.  Oh, God.  Fargo was good.  Huh?  Jaws.  Yeah, I hated that one.  What was the name of that movie?  Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.  Close Encounters.  Close Encounters was called the long road with the light at the end of it.  Yeah, that was kind of mysterious.  Attack on the 50-foot woman because she's got giant titties.  I want to be with a giant.  Yeah, Apocalypse was great. 
[01:01:30]  I love the Apocalypse.  Apocalypse Now is great.  Yeah, of course.  Ah, The Bride of Frankenstein.  Ah, it's so frightening.  She's marrying a monster.  Metropolis is number one.  That is a cool-ass fucking poster.  It's 1927.  Is that in an order of...  Well, yeah.  I mean, you know, there's a thousand lists out there, but on this particular list...  You found one that's pretty good.  What would an original Metropolis movie poster go for?  Thousands of dollars.  What was Metropolis?  I never saw that.  Oh, my God.  It's a glimpse of the future from 1927.  Look out! 
[01:02:00]  You know what's funny?  And the future had no Negroes.  They have New Moon.  No, it didn't.  The Twilight Saga, New Moon.  I didn't think that was...  I liked Twilight better than New Moon.  We heard you yesterday.  No, but I'm on Eclipse now.  We heard you yesterday.  Now he's on Eclipse.  I'm on Eclipse.  You.  I like Eclipse.  You are a girl.  No, not...  At times, you're a girl.  I'm not a girl.  I'm not a girl.  I'm not a girl.  I swear I have a penis.  What are we, in third grade?  I'm not a girl. 
[01:02:30]  They had to put the taking of Pelham 123.  They had to send the other black people on the poster.  Come on, stop.  Oh, stop, please.  Oh, I love you, man.  This is awful.  Can we see the trailer for Metropolis?  Metropolis.  Because one of the themes today is how technology and everything is moving...  Has changed.  ...moving quickly at this point.  Metropolis.  We're going to have that Ray Kurzweil in.  The futurist.  I saw a little bit of that Walt Disney thing that they have also.  Walt Disney biography.  And he's talking about like Epcot before they build it.  And what it was going to be and all that shit. 
[01:03:00]  But it's just so cool watching people's glimpse of what they think the future is going to  be.  I actually spent my entire night last night reading about Epcot.  Really?  Yeah.  See?  Isn't it fun?  That thing was on CNBC.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  CNBC.  Then you're going to like Ray because that's exactly what he's about.  Telling us what he thinks the future is going to be like.  Yeah.  So.  Well, we'll see if he's right.  All right.  Let's see this.  I'm pretty sure it's a silent film, so we're not going to get much out of it.  It did not work that much, the movie post, too, by the way.  There's a. 
[01:03:30]  That's like some cool shit, though, for back then.  1927, yo.  Yeah.  How did they make those rings?  Fucking.  Seriously.  That looks pretty good for 1920 or whatever.  And who's that?  Is that America's sweetheart Mary Pickford or just another girl that looks like a Fritz Lang  science fiction masterpiece?  Yes.  Now restored with more than 25 minutes of newly discovered footage.  A lot of films are half hour.  A Negro.  Wait a minute.  Ah.  The one moving so quickly back then. 
[01:04:00]  I want to see this again.  Again?  You saw it?  As a kid.  But I didn't understand it.  There's big machines and pistons and fucking.  Yeah.  It's like fucking weird.  Brilliant for the time.  Jesus.  Man, the machines kind of go a little bullshit.  That music's cool as fuck, isn't it?  What's this broad? 
[01:04:30]  There's flooding and rape.  Why couldn't they figure out sound?  Why couldn't they figure out that sound thing?  I don't know.  They did after a while.  Look at that.  It's almost a naked chick.  Oh, really?  They did?  Remember Reaper?  Yeah, they figured out sound in movies, though.  I didn't know that.  Certain people are great at sounds.  Like in films, certain guys are better than others.  Look at this fucking thing coming up.  She's topless.  Metropolis.  Metropolis.  Oh, man.  That's pretty cool. 
[01:05:00]  That's probably half the movie right there.  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't we take our first break?  Collectible rare posters.  So we got Brooklyn Decker.  We should promote that.  Yeah.  That hot piece of Ace.  Yeah.  She's starting here Monday.  Who else are we going to get from the movie?  Swarton.  We get the Nick.  The Nick is coming in.  Oh.  How about Bill Shirley?  Who?  Bill Shirley.  Who's that?  Wasn't he in the movie, Bill Shirley? 
[01:05:30]  Boo.  You're listening to O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony.  On the virus.  Sirius XM.  Wow, we are rocking in.  Well, this is Slash.  And the reason, I guess he's going to be making an appearance with the Black Eyed Peas at halftime. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, yeah.  At the big game.  Are we allowed to say Super Bowl or we got to make believe it's not the Super Bowl?  We have to call it the big game.  We can say Super Bowl.  We just can't use the name to advance ourself in any way.  We can say the Super Bowl is this Friday.  Is this Sunday?  Yeah.  Oh, is it a surprise appearance?  Slash?  How is it a surprise if we're talking about it?  We're not in the know.  Who's playing?  No one tells us things. 
[01:06:30]  Usher, too.  Usher will be there.  Oh, good.  I'm not enough for him lately.  You don't like the Black Eyed Peas?  I don't know anything about them.  Kind of like the Black Eyed Peas.  I'm not going to lie.  You like Forge.  A Forge.  A Forge.  Forge.  Forge.  I don't dislike Forge.  Forge.  Forge.  You like Forge?  Forge is very good.  What's their latest song?  Let's give it a try.  Their damn songs are fucking catchy.  What can I tell you?  It is.  They're going to do a 15-minute medley of their hits.  Oh, wow.  Do they have hits? 
[01:07:00]  Is that before or after?  Yeah, they got hits.  Before or after the Glee?  Isn't the Glee doing something?  Yeah, that's a surprise.  Glee's got the after Super Bowl slot.  Oh.  Oh, really?  When everyone's going, well, good night.  Thanks for the party.  I'll see you at work tomorrow.  And then they're doing...  That's when they get...  Yeah, I think it's like an hour-long Super Bowl special.  It worked for the Wonder Years.  And, uh...  Is that after the Bears game?  I don't...  Jesus, I don't even know.  Worked for Survivor.  Survivor debuted after the Super Bowl.  Worked for Miami Vice.  It's a Glee show, not a Glee performance. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, no.  If that makes sense.  It's an actual Glee show.  It's the show.  Ah.  Oh, yeah.  That'll work fine.  I thought they were doing something at the actual game.  I don't know.  It worked for Hello, Larry.  No, it didn't.  Hello, Larry.  I'm too good.  Worked for Super Train.  You're making us angry now.  Super Train.  All right, let's listen to the latest from the Black Eyed Peas.  And let's, uh...  I'm not even sure if I know this.  I'm not even sure if I know this.  I'm not even sure if I know this.  I'm not even sure if I know this.  I'm not even sure if I know this.  I'm not even sure if I know this.  No, you're an N. 
[01:08:00]  Is this Will.i.m?  This stinks so far.  I'ma be on the next lap.  I'ma be rocking over that bass trap.  I'ma be chilling with my...  I'ma be making all them...  I'ma be...  I'ma be...  I'ma be...  I'ma be... 
[01:08:30]  I'ma be shakin' my hands.  You gon' be lickin' your lip.  I'ma be taking them picks.  Looking on fly and shit.  I'ma be the flyest chick.  I'ma be spreading my wings.  I'ma be...  Catchy.  I like this.  Do it, do it.  Oh, fuck.  I like this.  All right.  Probably pissing off people.  Oh, Dara, I never had a chance.  It's probably pissing off people because if it doesn't have, like, a lead guitar.  No, the beat is good.  As a guy with long hair, you know, they get mad at us. 
[01:09:00]  Forgi sounds sexy.  Do you like that ad?  Forgi sounds sexy.  Do you like that ad?  When she sings all gangster.  Yeah, I kind of like that.  That was kind of catchy.  I don't know much about Forgi.  Like, I've never heard her sing.  Like, oh, that's Forgi.  But I mean.  I know Forgi's face and voice.  You know, I know when I see her.  I knew that wasn't the one I.  Yeah, do the other one.  Because the one you played, I think, is kind of old.  This is the new one.  Oh, whoa.  I've heard this. 
[01:09:30]  They twist this up a little bit.  Do they?  And I swear this is true.  He holds up a girl and his pancreas falls out of his asshole.  Too soon?  No.  By the way, we missed a nagling.  This is their latest song.  That other one is pretty old at this point.  Oh, nagle.  I saw the end of my life.  Oh, shit.  Oh, oh, oh. 
[01:10:00]  30 bits.  Yeah.  30 bits.  All right.  And then what happens?  The beats are very good.  But what happens after this?  All right.  Kick it in.  I came up in here to rock.  Light a fire, make it hot.  I don't want to take no pictures.  Where's Forgi?  Does Forgi come in?  Yeah, she'll come in and save the song.  I think she does with this band.  I don't want to hear this if it doesn't have Forgi.  Yeah. 
[01:10:30]  Where's Forgi?  I want to hear her.  She got a sexy, like a wigger voice.  Okay, here we go.  Come on, Forgi.  Here she comes.  I do like the Forgi.  A little auto-tune.  Let me say hi to Chris in Ohio.  Chris? 
[01:11:00]  Hey, Chris.  Hey, Forgi just redid Barracuda.  By Hart?  Yeah.  Who sang it?  Who redid it?  Who's who redid it?  Forgi.  Who?  Never heard of her.  Never heard of her.  Oh, yeah.  Whatever.  Never heard of her, sir.  Listen to the show.  All right.  Here's the Forgi.  Oh, yeah.  Forgi redid this. 
[01:11:30]  This is the original.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is the original, though.  No, not quite.  All right.  It's rocked up.  When do they twist it?  Where's the twist?  Right when it comes in.  Does Forgi have the range?  And the power?  That tugboat Annie had?  Damn.  This is Forgi?  All right.  Let me hear a little more.  Don't turn this off. 
[01:12:00]  All right.  Okay.  Holy shit.  Now kicks up here.  You're lying so low in the waves  And I bet your body it was me  You had me down, down, down, down  On my knees  Now once a bear could I  Forgi!  Forgi.  Forgi.  Forgi.  She's way better at singing rock and roll songs  Yes.  Because she was really good in that Paradise City cover, too. 
[01:12:30]  Right.  Like, I can listen to this, but she's doing this.  I was so listening.  I think I might download this.  That's probably why Sir Max will do it.  He'll probably play Paradise City with Forgi.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like how she didn't twist it. 
[01:13:00]  She just went with what the song is about.  But, uh...  Yeah.  What does she look like, Travis? 
[01:13:30]  What does Fergie look like?  Fergie.  She's hotter.  Her girl's a little fucked up.  Her girl's a little fucked up.  It looks like she's, uh...  Has gone down Botox Road a couple times, unfortunately.  Botox Road, or...?  I think there's a little Botox action happening with the face these days.  She married?  But it's good.  She's all right.  I like the Forgi.  She's all right.  Wow, man.  I didn't know that song was out.  I'm downloading that shit today.  She does kick ass singing rock. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, that's not in a song.  Why'd she put that in there?  Forgi really gets crazy and frat boyish.  Should we go to the end with this?  Turn this up.  Oh, look at her wet pussy.  She pisses herself when she sings.  You didn't know that?  No. 
[01:14:30]  Forgi pisses herself when she sings.  She's incontinent?  Forgi pisses herself, right?  She has pissed herself while singing.  I bet she pissed herself singing this.  This is like, fuck, yeah.  Shouting those notes out and pissing.  This will push out some piss.  Oh, she's wearing shorts.  It was trickling into her socks.  Jimmy, would you sniff those shorts on there like that?  Just with a piss in there?  They're going to have to call it, instead of the Super Bowl,  they're going to have to say, 
[01:15:00]  Forgi's singing the toilet bowl or something.  That's a good one, Chip.  But she pissed her pants, not the toilet.  I hope she pisses herself at the Super Bowl,  and it's a big controversy.  I hope a log falls out like a little rabbit tail.  She doesn't piss herself every show.  Oh, it's not like a thing she does?  Yeah.  It was just one and done.  Right.  It's not like a Gigi Allen thing.  Or like Alice Cooper's cutting his own head off at the guillotine.  Right.  No, it's not one of those things.  Something like that, no?  She raps, too, Forgi. 
[01:15:30]  No, she doesn't.  She's on Kanye's new album.  Forgi has a lot of different singing styles.  A lot of range, a lot of talent.  Very, very good.  She's a talented gal.  I like her doing this barracuda.  Yeah, that sounds good.  I recommend her so much.  I think she hit all the notes, right?  This is Mark.  Oh, hell yeah.  Mark.  No problem.  Yeah.  Nothing worse than when someone redoes a song,  they can't hit that note.  I love her to redo Disco Duck.  That was funny.  Oh, Disco, Disco Duck.  I love Disco Duck in Saturday Night Fever  when the guy at the dance fucking studio 
[01:16:00]  was teaching all the old people how to do Disco Duck.  And he's like, yeah, come on!  And he spins around.  And the old bag is just sitting there doing Disco Duck.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.  Forgi should do this.  You think she really?  Yeah.  She could probably do the duck voice, too.  Very talented.  I really want to hear Forgi do this.  They should sample that opening note, anyway.  Somebody should.  Somebody's probably stolen it.  Went to the party the other night. 
[01:16:30]  And now who did this?  Rick D's, right?  Rick D's.  It's funny.  This is when a DJ could just get a hit song.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  How in the world can I keep my suit?  How in the world?  Hey, I'm holding steady at 65%.  Remember you talk about how many chicks he's banging?  Rick D's always bustin' my onions.  Rick D's had billboards in L.A. like a year ago.  Did he?  For what?  For his hit Top 40 show.  And he had a big, giant butt on the billboard that he was shaking. 
[01:17:00]  That's crazy.  It was nuts.  He is still crazy.  It made me not want to come back to New York.  Disco Duck.  Here it is.  Where?  Ah.  Let's go, mama.  No.  Let's go, mama.  Let's go, mama.  Let's go, mama.  Let's go, dance.  You like this, Jimmy?  I see your...  Oh, here it is.  Everyone, do the hustle.  My back and neck are itching.  Don't be a fuck.  I used to sing that when I was a kid.  Yes.  Yeah.  And I'm not in front of mommy because she would have hit me. 
[01:17:30]  Disco.  Disco.  Disco.  Disco Duck.  Come on, it's a duck and it's doing disco.  Bunch of people in platform shoes all due to die of age shortly.  And they have no idea because they've never heard of it.  Come on.  Looking good out there, people.  I love that polyester look.  Yeah.  William Mason should be shooting his wife through this song.  She should be shooting Rick Deese through this song.  This is horrible.  So you think Fergie should do the duck voice in this song? 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, Fergie.  Okay.  She could probably hit the notes.  Yeah.  He made some fucking money off this stupid song.  Oh, my God.  That's what's really sad.  He's the disco duck.  Disco.  Disco.  Disco.  Look at all the ducks.  Look at the ducks dancing on this video from UK Gold.  They're doing disco duck and there's ducks.  Don't be a cluck.  And there's people dancing around.  This is popular in England?  It was everywhere, man. 
[01:18:30]  Dr. DeMeno made this song pretty fucking famous.  Disco duck got huge.  I mean, it was huge.  I think it climbed the charts, man.  I think it was way up there on the charts.  That's everything.  That's Rick Deese.  That's Rick Deese.  What a mustache.  He even looks like Macy in fucking Boogie Nights.  Oh, yeah.  He's got that 70s disco look.  What year was this, 77, you think?  Oh, my God.  Maybe even earlier.  This is probably 76.  I would say 76.  Yeah.  I'm going 76.  Disco duck.  Yeah.  Nailed it.  That's me.  I know my disco duck. 
[01:19:00]  It is amazing how it is a slight victory to know the disco duck year.  Yes.  It's weird what you feel good about it.  It is.  I feel good about it.  I remember those years.  It was somewhere in 75.  What the fuck?  Whatever.  Did I say?  I don't know if I said this on air or off air.  Number one for a week.  All right.  That's not bad, though.  For a dumb radio guy song.  And what kicked it out?  Hopefully the rap in Duke.  I knew not to mention it. 
[01:19:30]  The rap in Duke.  I dare you to play it.  You don't have the guts to play it.  If You Leave Me Now by Chicago.  Oh, by Chicago.  Oh, really?  That song made me cry because some girl broke up with me.  Was it Dara?  That I never even talked to.  No.  There was some girl, and I had a huge crush on her in school out in California.  This was, I believe, at the time.  Yeah, it was.  And I was out in California.  Was her name Richarda?  No, it wasn't Richarda.  Richarda!  And I never spoke a word to this girl, but I was completely infatuated in love with her. 
[01:20:00]  And I would think of what it would be like to, like, be with her and just hang out and kind of, like, get to know each other and really, like, fucking sweep her off her feet kind of a thing.  She would love you as a person.  Yes.  Yeah, because you're the one who should sweep her off her feet, the fucking, the weird, awkward nerd with the little fake rocket.  That's who's going to sweep her off her feet. 
[01:20:30]  I had a horse.  And the horse named Shadow, or whatever its name was that you jerked off.  Nightmare.  Okay, Nightmare.  Nightmare.  It was a girly horse.  I can't.  God damn, you were romantic.  What happened to you?  So, well, well.  What the fuck happened?  Well, she.  Who broke your heart?  That sent you down this road?  I don't know.  I just figured, fuck it.  You had a lot of romance.  I just figured they're all cunts and whores now.  You know, the young Anthony had a lot of romance in his fucking soul.  As my good friend Jim once said, sober 21 years at the time, ah, women are all cunts, including my mother and the Virgin Maddie. 
[01:21:00]  Greatest quote ever.  How do you argue that?  I can't argue that.  I love this girl.  Never talked to her.  And then one day, and this went on for, dude, it was like most of the school year.  Remember that feeling you would get?  I was looking, yeah.  That fucking feeling deep inside, like, oh.  Yes.  Every time I saw her, I was like, and then I was, I used to get mad because I would go home and try to picture her face.  And I was so infatuated with her that I couldn't picture her face.  And it would annoy me.  I was so in love with this girl. 
[01:21:30]  And then I went, I'd go to school the next day and it was like, oh, there she is.  And that's how she looks.  And she had taken a picture.  Yeah.  With what?  The Kodak Instamatic?  Could you stand there?  Oh, wait, my flash cube didn't go off.  Was there anything worse when you're going through those feelings at that age?  You're talking about, what, 15?  This is 14.  Anything worse when you're going through those feelings for someone and then realize that fucking bitch had not, doesn't have a clue you're alive and certainly doesn't have the same feelings you had?  Yeah. 
[01:22:00]  Remember how empty that made you feel?  Like, holy shit, this was a one-way fucking ride.  That's where this fucking disaster is heading because I was totally infatuated with her, never talked to her, couldn't remember what she looked like.  And it used to piss me off because I wanted to, like, see her face in my mind's eye and I couldn't.  And then I went to school.  The music is perfect.  Yeah.  And she was walking down the hall holding hands with this perfect football player guy. 
[01:22:30]  And you were thinking that she wasn't even into that type of guy because she likes a good personality.  I spent months trying to find an in, trying to find some studying her to try to find a way where I could go up to her.  And I played it out in my head for months of how I would approach her.  And she'd smile and laugh at what I said.  And I'd be like, oh, you want to go out?  We could go horseback riding or whatever.  She'd be like, cool.  And it would be the most romantic, great scene ever.  And then she's walking down the hall. 
[01:23:00]  You get nothing.  You lose.  Good day, sir.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Man, you are one pathetic loser.  I was.  You're such a super lady.  You're such a super lady.  You're a loser.  Your fantasy would be the ass to go to horseback riding? 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, like horseback riding and hang out because it was like fun to do.  What a fucking asshole.  And no, because then I could show her like something I was really good at.  Like I would jump fences and stuff.  Oh, you would ride to the bar?  So I was bummed the whole day.  I mean, fucking ridiculous bummed.  And then I came home and that song, If You Leave Me Now by Chicago, started playing. 
[01:24:00]  And even though I never had anything with this girl except my own dumb fantasies, it was now over.  So in essence, she left me.  I started crying.  I was laying on my little bed at home.  Because the fantasy relationship was over.  It was over.  And I was crying my little eyes out to this song.  Did you make it hurt?  Faggot!  Did you make it hurt more by just playing this song over and over again?  Oh, I was like. 
[01:24:30]  Why do human beings do that horse shit?  She threw away the biggest part of me.  Right.  Why did she leave?  They were singing to you.  Who was the biggest part of you?  This cunt.  Your little boyish erection.  Oh, no.  It was more than just that, Jimmy.  To me, this girl was like, I loved her.  And she didn't even know it.  No.  And you never even got a chance to tell her.  And she was friends with, like, the popular crowd.  So she was the one that, like, I'd see her coming out of the classroom.  And you could see this in a fucking movie.  It was slow motion. 
[01:25:00]  She would come out of the classroom holding her books, clutching her books to her chest.  And with two of her hot, popular friends, just, like, with the big smile, turning slowly to talk to each one of them.  And laughing.  Her hair going in the breeze.  Her, but she had, like, this strawberry blonde hair, and it would just wispily move as she does.  And I would just sit there looking at her going, I gotta make this girl love me.  And the key is that she was different from the other popular girls. 
[01:25:30]  Because the other popular girls, they weren't interested in a personality.  I wanted nothing to do with the other popular girls.  She was a popular girl, but she knew that I had something to offer.  And you two would connect on that personal level.  Yes.  Where you'd just be in love and best friends.  Yes, best friends, in love.  We would show, like, public displays of affection in school so everyone would know we were in love.  So if she got to know you, she would see what a special...  You could show her what a real relationship was.  All she would have had to do was get to know me, and I knew that.  I knew that all it would have taken was for me to be able to walk up to her and break the ice somehow, 
[01:26:00]  but I never knew how to break the ice.  Sure, because that would have been what she wanted was the guy who ran home and put his face on the bed  and kicked his little long sock feet with your fucking Ben Franklin stockings on.  And you'd try to call her on a phone, but your ear would smell like spaghetti.  Well, it didn't launch across the room.  And I was brokenhearted for a relationship that never happened.  How old were you?  14 or something like that.  Oh, you were...  Oh, gee, I think you were like 7. 
[01:26:30]  No!  No, no, no.  This is like, gushy, 14, maybe 15.  Like, I was just really...  This was heartbreaking to me.  She could only get to know you.  And every time I hear this song, I fucking remember that dumb girl.  Well, she was with a fucking football player.  Was he a quarterback?  Hopefully he wasn't like a wide receiver or a running back.  No, no, believe me.  Was he at least a tight end or a quarterback?  Not in Dana Point in 1975.  Believe me, you were hard-pressed to find even somebody like Sam.  So you'd see her after that.  You'd probably still, like, hope she wasn't with the guy. 
[01:27:00]  No, I knew at that point it was done.  Like, she ruined it.  How long did you fantasize about it?  She ruined our relationship.  But she never knew, right?  It was for most of an entire school year.  I swear to you.  And you were just...  You were gonna muster up the guts.  The second I saw her in business machines class,  which was...  They put an adding machine in front of us and made us...  You was...  But you...  And, and, you didn't...  She never knew?  Never knew!  Unless she's listening right now and going, 
[01:27:30]  I'm that cunt!  Let's find her.  Let's find her so you can tell her.  I wish I remembered her name.  Because maybe we could Facebook her.  How great would that be?  It would be great to see what a slob she is now.  Wouldn't that make you feel better?  It would...  No!  She's with our football player.  To me, she still looks exactly the same.  Yep.  She's got her strawberry blonde hair.  And it was almost in a cut like...  Oh, really?  Like the...  Like the Pulp Fiction fucking...  Show the Woodstock photo of the...  The famous couple.  I know.  It's going to be a disaster.  Maybe go out there and date her daughter. 
[01:28:00]  And get her back.  Get her back.  Maybe her and that football player turned out something nice.  Yeah, get her back.  Even though she never had an idea that you were so deeply in love with her.  Not one idea.  Well, what kind of math did you do in the little class?  Did you do like one 14-year-old plus girl equals douche?  Plus Chicago song equals crying faggot.  What a fruit.  We all do that with music.  It's okay.  It's embarrassing.  It was so embarrassing. 
[01:28:30]  You were in love.  I was weeping to fucking Chicago.  What a fag.  I love it.  I've gotten so jaded now.  Oh, I've gotten so jaded.  But who did it?  You women have fucked me over in my youth.  And that's why I'm like I am.  Who did it to you, though?  What?  Girls like that.  That was a moment.  That was part that chiseled it away.  It wasn't one big defining moment.  It was just a bunch of them.  Do you think Michelangelo fucking hit a thing of granite and fucking a statue was there? 
[01:29:00]  You'd chip away.  A little piece here, a little piece there.  Yes.  Do you think that you could ever that those emotions could ever come back if you met the right one?  I could never feel like that again, by the way.  That was a feeling of utter, complete love, infatuation, lust, passion.  She was your everything.  Everything.  And there is no way at my age and as an adult, and I don't care who the fuck you are, you 
[01:29:30]  can never recapture that feeling.  That butterfly feeling.  It's just, it's not there.  Not even for like Shawnee Smith or anything?  No.  I'd bang her and be like, thanks.  Thanks for the ride.  Thanks, toots.  Shawnee.  That's sad.  Loved you in the stand.  That's sad.  Now hit the bricks, toots.  You can't recapture that.  And that's something that only happens with the mix of youthful hormones and being naive  and just everything being brandy new like that, all those feelings, it doesn't come back. 
[01:30:00]  You might as well just kill yourself at 30, people out there listening.  Oh, man.  Just let her rip.  Yeah.  Calling you Ducky.  Oh, Ducky from...  They're calling you Ducky.  Yeah, what was that?  New balls.  Pretty and Pink.  Pretty and Pink was on the other night.  Yeah.  They're calling you Ducky.  Douchey.  Douchey and Pink.  You are.  If she only would have heard me sing Dara, that was years later.  Yeah, then she would have known Sucky. 
[01:30:30]  That would have gotten her.  Well, then, you should get a real doll.  What?  And dress it up like that little girl from junior high, high school, whatever the fuck you want.  I'm trying for a sec here.  My strange addiction.  The guy that likes, loves the real doll.  We're going to do that after the break.  Yeah.  Just tell people what the guy's name is.  Wow, the real doll's are starting to look pretty damn good.  I haven't seen their website in a few years.  It's been a while.  Let me see that.  It's been a while.  Remember how we were talking about technology?  Yeah.  Because we got Ray Kurzweil coming in, the futurist. 
[01:31:00]  Which one do you want?  That fucking real doll shit's getting there.  I like the blonde 4-in.  Blonde 4-in?  Yeah.  Let me see her.  She's got mysterious eyes and authentic Greek features.  Let's pick out our real doll type.  Yeah, that's my type right there.  More of the fat pussy.  That's mine.  She's nice and pale.  That absolutely is your type.  That's too big.  Too big a tits.  That's too matronly.  Too big a tits.  She's fantastic.  I want to cook you dinner.  Exactly.  I want to tell you to be home early and don't get hurt.  Danny's looking at the guys for himself.  Oh, Danny.  Danny.  Come on, Danny. 
[01:31:30]  Come on.  The cocks don't have a hard duty.  I cried to Chicago and I'm calling you a faggot.  Go back.  I want to pick out my real doll.  Yeah.  Which one would you go?  Well, when I go sex dolls, I got a booby fetish.  They got to be a little bigger.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A booby fetish on sex dolls.  Although in real life.  Well, I don't think that matters.  I think you could choose the titty.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You just need to go for the face.  Go for the face first.  Number two is not bad.  Number two is pretty good.  You went with four, right?  I went with four.  Yeah.  Don't fucking take my chick. 
[01:32:00]  I don't want to cry again.  I don't want it to look like a polished porn star.  No.  See?  I like all natural girls.  Wow.  You know what?  14.  Well, nah.  It kind of looks like Joan Jett.  Real doll 14.  Yeah.  She does look like Joan Jett.  All right.  I used to jerk off to the Crimson and Clover video.  I will go number 12.  Let's look at number 12.  Okay.  Number 12. 
[01:32:30]  All right.  Number 12.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  They really are getting good at that.  Yeah, they are.  Would you hit that real doll?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't hit that.  I didn't even clean it out when I was done.  But they might be fucking with you.  That might be a real porn star.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Because she was on her belly.  Come on, man.  That didn't look like a doll.  I don't know.  Let me see.  That looked real, but you could tell it was.  Ooh.  I let my cum just coagulate in her.  No, I think that's rubber.  How creepy would you feel?  When?  At what point? 
[01:33:00]  That's what I'm saying.  During the fucking, you're not going to feel creepy.  You're just like, wow, this feels good.  But as soon as you're done, you're going to feel like the biggest piece of shit  as you're cumming, between each fucking, between each pump of cum, you'd be like,  I am a fucking degenerate.  You take it fucking a doll.  You take it out of the box, you put it in the box, then you throw it in a dumpster.  I'll tell you that you're describing fucking.  Roll it in the carpet and take it to the landfill.  That's the life of a real doll.  Oh, that's a good one.  Which one was that?  Life of a real doll right there.  It was the same face with different hair. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, really?  What about the totally naked one standing up?  Yeah, kind of like that one.  What number was that?  How much are they?  The faces, they got to work out a little bit.  I think they're like $5,000 or $6,000.  $5,000 or $6,000.  Didn't we try to get one over the years?  We had the guy on.  Like, just send us one.  Nah, he wouldn't do it.  They're too much money.  We had enough fucking guys that were going to, like, give it, you know, take it for a ride.  I like the people that make them.  They get some Asian woman sitting there with emotionless face, just plugging pubic hair into the thing  with a little fucking needle.  It says you can get them in custom skin tones, like an avatar reel, like blue. 
[01:34:00]  Can I go real black?  What does a black one look like?  It's always been one of my fantasies to go real black.  You never banged a black chick?  No, man.  Dude, really?  Made out with one, and then it got close, but then the smell got to me.  Really?  What?  She stunk?  Wow, really?  Yes, she was fucking...  Oh, jeez.  Yeah.  Was it her understing or a pussy?  That happened with a stripper.  It was that foreign smell.  I didn't really understand it.  Yeah, yeah.  I didn't really understand it.  Yes, it did scare me a little bit.  Oh, my God. 
[01:34:30]  What's up?  That's a good one.  Do they get darker than that?  That's too light.  No, the only color available is light African.  Oh, that's...  Oh, really?  Light African, because they know they're racist.  That's some racist shit.  That is racist shit.  I want something to...  What's this?  The Bob Saget?  Oh, Danny's looking at the guy.  What the fuck?  Danny, come on.  You can't look at the girls without looking at the girls.  Look at those abs.  Fair time, right?  What's that?  Hey, if you buy that, I'll suck its dick in front of everybody.  Oh, Danny's looking at the dick, man. 
[01:35:00]  Danny is looking at the dick.  Let me see the shiny head on that cock.  That's great.  That's great.  They have to make the dicks, like, hard.  Yeah.  Does it have a limp dick on it, and then you plug on the...  You probably just turn it.  It looks like it's an attachment.  You probably...  You know what it is?  They probably all point one way, and when you turn it like a fucking spigot, it pops  up.  Yeah.  Yeah, how do...  What's the technology in the cock?  Yeah, does it do anything?  Does it cum?  You can make your real dolls have sex with each other.  It actually comes with a bag of onions that you can rub on the testicles and asshole 
[01:35:30]  for realism.  Rub onion shards into the ass crack, and pretend he just came off his motorcycle.  Ah, shit.  That's terrible.  Why don't we take a quick break, because we got Ray coming in, the futurist Ray Kurzweil,  and we want to do these clips from My Strange Addiction, the guy that's obsessed with his  real doll.  Yeah.  So we'll do that.  Read what his name is, what the guy's name is.  Dave Cat?  Yeah.  The guy's name is Dave Cat. 
[01:36:00]  Dave Cat?  Yes.  And they never make reference to the fact that the word cat is in his name.  Oh, okay.  That's a little weird.  All right.  Any more pertinent information?  Dave Cat.  Dave Cat.  That's Sam's rosy cheeks.  I know.  They are really rosy today.  They're very kissable.  Thanks.  Like a boy, like you want to pinch him and just say, oh, good job on your test.  So impish.  Then decapitate him.  Why?  Why?  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:36:30]  Opie and Anthony show on the virus.  Sirius XM.  And now.  And now.  The Opie and Anthony show.  On the virus.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Woo!  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And who gives a shit info? 
[01:37:00]  Mick Jagger will perform at the Grammys for the first time next Sunday.  The Grammys.  Who cares?  Grammys!  Why hasn't he done that before?  Grammys!  He was supposed to do it in like the late 80s.  You're lying.  Was he?  No, you're right.  Being a huge Yankees fan, why is Andy Pettit retiring?  I thought he had another year in him.  He's sick.  At least another year.  What do you mean?  Oh, fuck.  He got me, though.  Fuck.  He's so good.  I'm a good actor.  He's sick. 
[01:37:30]  You got me so bad.  As a matter of fact, he's sick.  No, this is a big surprise, though, right?  Didn't they sign him?  His official statement is he wants to spend more time with his family.  Bullshit.  I don't know what that means.  He can't wait one more year?  Well, you know what?  He's had a great career.  He's had more fucking playoff time than a lot of pitchers have had time just fucking pitching.  And a lot of championships.  What's he, have you, eight?  No.  I have no idea how many World Series does, uh, he's got five. 
[01:38:00]  He does have five.  It's a lot.  I mean, yeah, five.  Yeah, he's got five.  Wasn't he supposed to pitch this year, though?  No, he was never signed.  They were talking to him.  Yeah, he was kind of like, you know, maybe I'll come back, maybe I won't.  And apparently he really probably would have come back if they signed Cliff Lee, but they  fucked that up, so.  Yeah.  He, uh, he's had a great career.  What the fuck?  And the press loves him.  He's probably going to be a first fucking round inductee.  First Ballot Hall of Famer.  Yeah.  Has to be. 
[01:38:30]  Heard some stat this morning.  He has something like a hundred more wins than losses.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  It's a nice number.  And he's just been one of those guys that, he has had a little bit of the controversy  with the fucking steroid growth hormone bullshit.  There's no chance he gets in on a first ballot.  No?  No.  Why?  No chance.  He was very good, but he's not very great.  He's also the press's sweetheart, though.  He was very good to the press.  How many World Series has he been involved with winning?  Oh, my God.  Five.  He has five rings.  Five rings, and he's big.  I think he's a first Ballot Hall of Famer.  I completely disagree.  What's his record? 
[01:39:00]  I think it'll take him a few years to get in.  Really?  He's 240.  240 or 138.  240 or 138.  He was very good, but you've got to remember, it's the Hall of Fame.  It's going to take him a few years.  Yeah, but five World Series rings, and he was an active part of him.  He wasn't some middle reliever who happened to be there.  He was never the most dominant pitcher on his staff.  No, but he was the stopper.  Whenever there was a loss, Pettit was the guy that would win the game.  He was clutch.  He'll probably get in, but definitely not the first time.  Ken Griffey Jr. and Trevor Hoffman are both going to be on the same ballot.  They'll get in on the first time.  Ken Griffey Jr.  Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:39:30]  I really don't think he's going to get in on the first time.  I think you're wrong.  All right.  When do we get to say?  Five years.  Five fucking years, we'll say.  I'll email all of you.  I say definitely in five years.  This show won't be around.  Five years.  Look, everyone goes, oh, yeah.  Email us.  Email me.  I'll be on Venus.  Right.  Hey, let's play these real doll clips, because we got Ray Kurzweil coming in.  The Futures.  Hey!  Hey!  Drink a lot of coffee before Ray gets here. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  And hopefully Ray will, too.  That guy, he makes you want to sleep like your Rumpelstoolskin or something.  Oh, chip.  That's a good one.  Rumpelstoolskin?  Stoolskin.  It's a stoolskin.  Stoolskin is what gets pulled out when a cock is removed.  That's pretty good.  You watch the Strange Addiction, My Strange Addiction.  I love it.  Was this the one with the...  People eating toilet paper. 
[01:40:30]  Okay, it is that show?  Yeah, yeah.  Did you ever see the show with the woman with the cushion shit from the couch?  She eats the foam rubber out of the couch.  Did you ever see that one?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And she's not sick from that?  Well, they took her to the doctor, and they tell her that she's getting sick.  There's the women that eat detergent, and they tell her their teeth are falling out of her head.  And they're all like, I can't help it.  What a great show.  I got to check this one out.  I haven't seen it yet.  The latest one, they did a guy who's into his real doll.  That's his Strange Addiction.  Oh, I think...  Was that on the same one? 
[01:41:00]  Scab lady.  I like the girl that sucks her thumb everywhere.  And she's got this little cloth thing that she wraps around her pointer finger, and then she puts it under her nose to smell it.  It's like a crochet thing, and then she sucks on her thumb, and she has this boyfriend that's like, you know, it was kind of cute at first, but now it's getting a little annoying.  But what does she do?  She wraps this little cloth around her index finger and sucks her thumb and smells the cloth.  What is she...  And then she takes it off, and she goes to her boyfriend.  She goes, here, sniff it, and puts it under his nose. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, my God.  Is it wet?  Yeah, I guess the spit would get on there and everything.  She just sucks her thumb, and she's like wheeling a cart through the shopping center, and she's sucking her thumb.  She's in school, she's on the computer, she's constantly sucking her fucking thumb.  How about this fucking...  How about this fucking emotionally dead, repressed little twat stops trying to recapture you when she was loved as a baby?  That's exactly what this shrink said to her.  Fucking asshole.  She started crying.  I want to be loved like I was a baby. 
[01:42:00]  Well, then you shouldn't be a cunt.  I love how angry we all get at things.  Because it's so fucking...  You self-centered asshole.  I want you to suck his dick and fuck him for dating her.  My girlfriend, I actually caught my girlfriend one time.  Her thumb brushed her lips, and I said, I'll dump you if you do that again.  Well, we've got to move right into these clips, because Ray's going to be here very soon. 
[01:42:30]  My strange addiction, we meet Dave Cat, who loves his real doll.  My name is Dave Cat.  I'm 37 years of age.  And I can't live without my real doll.  Originally, when I first got her, I called her my synthetic girlfriend.  But it's actually progressed to the point where it's like, you know, she's my wife. 
[01:43:00]  She's not awake right now because, well, basically she kept hitting the snooze button.  So it's just like, just let her sleep.  It's not even worth getting her out of bed at this point.  I didn't see this show.  Is this guy putting it on for the cameras?  No, no, he's fucking crazy.  I recognize him from another documentary that I've seen about real dolls.  Is that the guy?  That's the same guy.  Oh, he looks like a fucking creep.  I believe it was called Guys and Dolls, actually.  He kind of looks like Marilyn Manson, sort of.  With a Hitler swoop hairdo.  Yeah, a little bit.  And in that clip, the doll was in...  Oh, my God, he picked the worst real doll. 
[01:43:30]  I think that's his...  That's a frump.  That's his new doll.  He's got a few of them.  He's got a new one with purple hair and pink hair.  This guy's just a ghoul.  Oh, my God.  All right, well...  When he was trying to...  The doll is just in his bed with the covers on her, and that's when he was saying,  Oh, she'd hit the snooze button.  Don't bother waking her up.  But it's a...  Eyes don't even shut.  It's just a doll with its eyes open.  Yeah, it's got its eyes open.  Do they got technology where they at least make the body feel warm?  No.  So they don't feel like you're fucking a corpse? 
[01:44:00]  It's silicone.  Yeah, they put radium inside of her.  Nothing.  What are they going to do?  How do you make it feel warm?  I'm sure these guys have figured it out.  You hook a hose up to one foot, and then pump hot water through it.  That would kind of be cool.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like a heated floor.  The inside of her talks like a thermos.  You know?  Just don't put ice cubes in it.  Ow.  Dave Cat talks about getting a real doll.  Of course, of course.  The whole interaction on a day-to-day basis, along the lines of, like, getting her dressed,  you know, brushing her hair, things of that nature, you know, it brings us closer together  as a couplet. 
[01:44:30]  I had actually worn this necklace a lot, and I decided she should have it.  It's kind of like, you know, when you give your sweetheart a class ring, that sort of thing.  Just like...  Photo shoots are something fun that we do.  When I first was even thinking about getting a real doll, I was just like, okay, well,  you know, the sex is going to be fantastic.  But there's also the whole concept of, like, taking photographs.  Yeah, he takes pictures with her, and they're displayed at his house, like...  And when he's getting her dressed and, like, combing her hair, you have to hook the back 
[01:45:00]  of its head in a stand.  So he just hooks this thing by the back of its head.  Yeah.  And then he starts putting this little choker on it that he wears.  Yeah, he hangs it up like Carbone in the fucking, uh, freezer truck.  Exactly.  Where's his family and friends?  Exactly.  If he had them, he wouldn't need to fucking talk to a doll.  With his stupid, weird Indian face.  I know.  Is he black?  Is he Indian?  He's ten different races.  Is he a complete loner?  He's giving it a foot massage.  No, he's got, he's got a couple friends, but they all say, hey, if it makes him happy. 
[01:45:30]  Get out of here.  It's giving, he's giving it a foot massage.  And it's just laying there.  Relax.  Foot massage to a lifeless fucking, I think she'll pull a chubby to his throat.  That'd be great.  Why does she need to relax?  All she does is get fucked by him all day.  He's putting little socklets on her.  What a creep.  Just kidnap someone already, you fucking asshole.  If you need to control someone that badly, just get a gun.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Fucking man up.  Dave Cat talks about wanting to go out with the doll and says goodbye to her. 
[01:46:00]  Well, sweetie, I'm heading over to the playhouse.  Come on.  Yeah, she's sitting there.  It's a pervert.  That's the word of the day, boys.  The doll's sitting on the couch, and so he's getting his stuff together and just when he's about to go out, so he's saying bye.  Here's what I would do.  I would fucking put a load of cum in that doll and then boot it into, that doll would have nothing but my fucking sneaker prints in its back.  Because I would fuck it.  I would dump cum in it and then boot it into the closet until I get home. 
[01:46:30]  Boot it.  My underpants and socks would be on its face.  He pulled its tongue out of its head.  Oh, great.  Good.  Probably got to clean it.  Yeah, then he's yelling snitches get snitches.  That looks like a corpse.  That's creepy.  Um, I should be back about the usual time.  She's cooped up in the apartment all the time.  I love to be able to take her places.  I'll be back before you know it.  Love you.  He's nuzzling his nose on his nose, saying I love you, and I'm making out with it. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, there goes that freak with the doll.  Her eyes don't even close.  Oh, God.  What an asshole this guy is.  He's the real deal, though.  That ain't no fucking put-on.  It's synthetic love.  Synthetic love, he calls it?  That's what he calls it.  It's garbage.  Dave Katz's friend comes over to go shopping.  My friend Monty will actually be coming around to visit us.  I have known Monty since 1980.  We grew up in the same neighborhood, about three houses away. 
[01:47:30]  Thank you.  I think a synthetic relationship appeals to Dave Katz.  That, on a few levels, Dave's a only child.  He's a very solitary individual.  He likes his silence, and he likes his space.  That's Monty Hall.  Of course, not Mrs.  Yeah, I have many times.  Thank you.  As much as he might like to take her to a concert or take her out to dinner,  just the stairs and the comments that would invite.  Would you pay an extra fucking...  It's not worth that kind of hassle.  It can't walk. 
[01:48:00]  You just carry it.  It's an inanimate object.  Oh, God.  Molding the pussies.  That's how they're making them.  How they're made?  Yeah, they put the teeth in.  They take the vagina and they...  Oh, look at that.  Yeah, look.  They just put the fucking labia minora in.  Stick the tongue in.  They put the clit in a vacuum press.  Yeah.  How it's made.  They guide how it's made.  You might wonder how these pussies are constructed.  We'll show you.  Here, the gentleman gets the hair all in order. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, she's hanging.  It's in a factory.  You're a real doll.  Dave Kat shops for clothes for the missus.  For the missus.  He calls his doll the missus.  What's that one?  What I'm going to do is actually try to get some shopping in for the missus.  It's obviously got to be stuff that she likes, but then there's obviously the aspect of like,  well, she versus what I think she wants of what I would want her to look good in.  This summer stuff is actually quite nice. 
[01:49:00]  What?  Tie pins?  Yeah, tie pins.  And what could she use?  You know, she's got a tie.  That's the thing.  She's worn it once.  This doesn't strike me as a tie pin.  Yeah, I'm a tie person.  You know, and we don't want to be one of those couples that like dresses alike because that's...  Creepy?  Yeah.  Oh, that's creepy.  For Dave, I hope that he's happy no matter what he does.  When he's ready to progress into something different, it'll be there.  But for right now, this is perfect. 
[01:49:30]  Progressing into something different is being a serial killer or something.  Yeah, that would be a progression.  Yeah.  Because this guy is fucking out of his mind.  And then he brings the clothes home and talks to it?  Yeah, because...  I got you, honey.  This store was like a thrift store, first of all.  It was the worst store ever.  Yeah, he's buying her shit.  She should leave him.  I would.  That would be great if he got home and she was gone.  Exactly.  She fucking left him somehow.  G.I. Joe was eating her pussy.  She was cheating with another inanimate object.  Or some fucking Macy's model thing had its fucking stiff arm in her box. 
[01:50:00]  A mannequin.  Yeah.  There's a mannequin over the house.  Oh my God, how could you do this to me if you leave me now?  Yeah.  Yeah, maybe you could build your own fucking...  My real doll of my high school girl that broke my heart.  Hey, sweetie.  Bitch.  Hi.  I got a lot of stuff for you.  You will be impressed.  She's going to love him, I think.  No, she's rubber.  It's not going to be a new look yet.  The same look, but I think she's really going to... 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, that dead look in her face.  This?  It's a shirt cardigan thing that just goes around.  He wheels it around in an office chair.  A pair of glasses.  It's the other one.  If you're in a wheelchair, at least you get to touch these crippled.  Yeah, that's true.  You're transparent.  Change your shit bag, fucker.  I figure they can go with that choker that you've got.  That's also transparent.  It's normal for children to have a rich fantasy life, including imaginary friends.  But when it continues into adult life, that's when there is a problem. 
[01:51:00]  You think?  That's all you get.  So there you go.  And you're welcome.  Wow, that guy is just...  He's scary.  What does he do for work?  Yeah, he's got to have money.  They didn't say what he does in this one.  He's probably a designer.  Oh, no.  He's packing her in a crate and kissing her goodbye.  Because I think he's crating her off to somewhere.  I think she's got to go back to the factory.  Why?  And have her cunt roto-rooted.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Oh, God, the mess that's in there. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  What they do is...  Power wash.  Oh, yeah.  Power wash all the holes.  They put a rolling pin from her face all the way down, and it just squeezes out like a toothpaste.  There you go.  And his crusted-up jizz shoots out like fucking rubber cement.  Jizz of jizz.  Hey, fucking Saeed from Lost has been fucking this chick.  And he said, where's the dog go?  Where's his dog go?  Unknown racial cum.  I think he's moving.  Oh.  Oh, is he moving?  Uh, he probably has to move every fucking three months.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe he register. 
[01:52:00]  Get a hold of this shit.  He's got to register.  He needs plenty of time.  Yeah, right.  Uh, the therapist.  Good.  Let's see what the therapist...  Is there some coddling going on?  Because I can't listen to therapists with the fucking coddling.  Coddle, coddle, coddle.  Oh, Christ.  Just tell him that he's an asshole.  Yeah.  This would be Shidore.  That looks like a horror movie.  Shidore.  Dave, some people would say that Chichon is a distraction.  It kind of derails you from...  From seeking an organic partner.  Yeah. 
[01:52:30]  I mean, I would be fascinated to learn why, you know, I can't seem to find, like, an organic partner that's good for me.  Organic partner.  But will that change my relationship with Chichon?  Not entirely sure.  Probably not.  Does this relationship provide security, a sense of comfort?  Why?  Why is he taking this tack?  Because he's an asshole.  Why?  What are you talking about?  Does this relationship...  How about as a therapist, you fucking use a little tough love? 
[01:53:00]  What would you guys say?  Creep.  You're an asshole.  Cut the shit.  Right.  You're fucking a toy.  This is really fucked up.  Why are you doing this?  That's the only question to ask.  Security.  A sense of comfort for you?  Yes.  Definitely.  Explain that to me.  After a long day of work or just interacting out and about, it's just...  I just don't want to have to interact with other people's inconsistencies, really.  One of the core definitions of addiction is engaging in a particular behavior or taking a particular substance to relieve pain. 
[01:53:30]  What's the pain here?  Uh, the pain, I would have to say, would be loneliness, really.  I've been in relationships before, and they weren't true relationships, they're all affairs.  I'm the sort of person that gets easily discouraged, so it's like, after a while, it's just like, okay, you know what?  I don't think I'm getting anywhere with this, and I'm wasting time and energy, so I need to find another route. 
[01:54:00]  See, so it makes sense.  Oh, perfect.  Makes complete sense.  It's consistent.  A real doll...  You gotta give it that.  Consistency.  It is consistent.  Oh, yeah.  It's there right where you left it.  It's not gonna be bitching when you get home.  No talking back.  Right.  And finally, the therapist finishes up.  Is there a part of you that thinks this is peculiar?  I just think it's a matter of time before people are, more people are choosing the synthetic option. 
[01:54:30]  Really?  He could be under a bridge with a needle in his arm.  He should be.  But that's not the type of pain relief that he has sought.  He has sought this type of fantasized relationship.  Let's say you, if you went on vacation, when you came back, would you talk to her about the vacation?  Yeah.  Would you share pictures?  Yeah, I'd be like, oh, okay, well, let's sit down and look at the pics, you know.  Well, but, you know, that's, I think, a natural thing that any couple would do. 
[01:55:00]  Dave, she can't see.  Yeah.  And she can't hear.  Yes.  It makes you feel good to do that.  And it's fulfilling for you.  Exactly.  And it doesn't hurt anyone.  Exactly.  So knock yourself out.  Yes.  Okay.  I get it.  He gets it.  I mean, I don't even know what to say.  It's just so, it's just fucking.  Well, don't you show, like, your wife pictures from your vacation? 
[01:55:30]  We go on vacation together, asshole.  Oh.  Oh.  Well, you can't bring a real doll on vacation.  That's the only thing.  That would be a little awkward.  He's, um, he sent it out.  He crated it up and sent it out, not because he's moving, to get maintenance done on it.  Oh.  Because one of the arms is a little fucked up.  The fuck is silly.  What's he doing with the arm?  And then the guy was wiping off the mouth, and it was like all this red lipstick-y shit was coming off.  Like, who cleans these fuck- who would maintain these, knowing that it's just a cum receptacle for some fucking guy of questionable racial background? 
[01:56:00]  Are you talking about Dave Cat?  Yes, Dave Cat.  Ugh.  All right, Sam Cat.  You're on the same boat.  I like that name.  Jimmy, I gotta ask, what happened?  I just thought, I don't want to talk about just the iPad.  I fucking hate.  Fuck Steve Jobs.  Oh, okay.  Fucking cunt.  What happened, though?  Something went up, boom, in the background.  Because you're fucking trying to order something.  I'm trying to order chocolate for my sister, and the fucking- you can't fucking do an order form on it, because the page keeps- you can't scroll up on this fucking iPad. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, I've had that problem before.  Yeah, it stinks for certain websites.  Where, like, yep.  And then it leaves you, like, an inch to fucking type shit in.  You can't scroll.  Did you throw your iPad?  Yes, I did.  That's what went?  Yes.  You can't fucking type on it.  They're durable, kind of.  I wouldn't even care if it broke.  I really don't.  Wow, man.  It's a laptop replacement.  No, it's not.  Fucking assholes at Apple.  Man, mine fell afoot the other day, and I cried like a little baby, thinking I broke my iPad. 
[01:57:00]  He fucking hurled that across the door.  Because I'm trying to enter a fucking shipping address.  I thought it was a bottle of water or something.  And I guess this was made for people who fucking have 2,600 eyesight.  2,600.  You just gave a great commercial for the iPad, man, because that thing's still working.  Oh, great.  Yeah.  Is that the order form thing?  Yeah.  Here's the order form.  And now you can't make it bigger?  No, well, you can't.  Now, I want to enter.  Let's see.  I'll start with her phone number.  So you click on the phone number thing. 
[01:57:30]  Don't make him try this again.  But it's blocked.  It's blocked by the fucking keyboard.  So I try to enter.  Let's see.  732.  Oh, don't turn to the number.  And it just blinks.  Now, look, I want to check it.  How do I check?  I have to lower this.  But if I hit that, it navigates away from the page.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  I don't mean to laugh.  No, no, no, but it's true.  It's fucking enraging.  I didn't know you threw your iPad.  What about in portrait mode?  Fuck.  Like this?  Let's see.  I guess I got to throw stuff still. 
[01:58:00]  Okay.  Oh, you got locked?  It should feel so good.  Fuck.  It was a reaction.  I didn't want to throw it.  I got to go back to that.  Oh, right.  You can't do it the easy way anymore.  You got to hit the hole.  Throw stuff.  Yeah, of course.  Destroy stuff.  What?  Settings?  Oh, you got to go the other way.  You can't just do it.  There we go.  Unlock it.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Where are we at?  Now, go and portrait.  Oh, shit.  You're right, Danny.  He just wrapped his head.  Okay.  Let's turn that.  I think you got to. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  Now, why would it turn?  Hold it up.  Yeah, hold it up.  Shake it like a magic A-K.  Until it's the right direction.  Let's see.  Of course, I navigated the way because I touched the hypersensitive.  Oh, you fucking tent.  No.  It's working now?  Oh, shit.  And you can't scroll that page up?  Let's go up.  Oh, there it goes.  No.  Why did it come back down?  Because it's fucking...  I like how he's trying to hold it in place with his thumb. 
[01:59:00]  But you can't.  I guess.  I don't know.  Maybe it's in order to use Flash.  Fucking Steve Jobs.  Cocksucker.  Well, I don't think you're going to have to worry about him no more.  Holy shit.  That is a very bad bug that they have to fix.  Yeah, maybe.  Safari stinks.  Oh.  Yeah.  Well.  Oh, shit.  Is it...  I'm waiting for Frisbee. 
[01:59:30]  Nah, that ain't going to happen.  No.  Jimmy has self-control.  Oh, not that time.  It happened once.  It just happened once.  That was scary.  He's all right.  What the hell is at my house?  What is this?  God, is that fucking annoying, though.  You got it working?  No.  I mean, I'm just doing it without even seeing what I'm typing in there.  And then I have to look at it after and go, okay, I got the number right.  But what a fucking...  How about you fix that so the webpages don't do that, you dummies?  I just play Angry Birds and do a little Twittering. 
[02:00:00]  That's all you should do with it.  That's what it is.  That's all I do.  It's a giant toy.  And then I got my MacBook for everything else.  Then I switched over to the MacBook.  Ugh.  I've finally taken my Christmas decorations down.  You're kidding.  No, I'm not kidding.  What day is it?  It's February, right?  It's February fucking...  I don't even know what.  Third?  You could officially be the last guy in the country.  Congratulations.  See, what happens is I have a company that comes in and puts it up and takes it down.  All the exterior Christmas decorations.  And they said, we can't take them down as long as there's snow and ice on the ground. 
[02:00:30]  And I said to them, I go, then I'm going to have Christmas decorations up until spring.  Wow.  Motherfucker.  Wow.  Get over here.  So they're there now with the cherry picker.  And they're taking my Christmas decorations down finally.  Holy crap.  Holy shit.  I went to, um, last night.  I barely listened.  I know.  No, I'm just talking.  They'll figure it out.  Out of the corner of my eye, there's something else going on.  I apologize.  It's like talking next to a suicide bomber with his hand on the fucking, on the dead man switch. 
[02:01:00]  Remember last night I said I was watching the town and my left eye was watching my kid.  I'm watching Jimmy out of my left eye and I'm watching you out of my right.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  It could go off any minute now.  Clip the red wire.  Clip the red wire.  This is where we're so different.  No, the blue wire.  You don't want this to go down and I so want this to go down.  No.  I'm a sick fuck when it comes to this stuff.  No, he's getting it.  It's so, but it's just, it plays a pain in the ass.  What makes me angry.  Let's, let's work through this. 
[02:01:30]  Is it's such, it's so not, you can't write on it.  You can't like write for real on it.  It's not a lap.  It's a phone to giant.  That's why I do like the iPad, but a part of me hates it.  That's why I bring my laptop in every day.  It's a fucking toy.  If you have a, if you have a laptop, do not get an iPad.  If you think you're going to replace your laptop with it.  No, no.  Oh, I didn't think that.  Here's my use of the iPad.  Yeah, the games, they're fun, but also certain web browsing.  I don't order shit on it because it is a pain in the ass.  But why can't you?  It's a fucking thousand dollars. 
[02:02:00]  You're right.  Cocksucker.  You're right.  But what I use it for, I go to websites, you know, I'll go to Drudge.  I'll go to other sites where you can just scroll through.  Sports sites.  And as long as, you know, sports clips.  There's no flash video.  A little YouTube game.  You watch some videos.  Yeah.  Things like that.  Yeah, why would there be flash?  Easy stuff.  Why would there be?  Well, they're duking it out.  And we win.  We win because, you know, Apple and Adobe have to duke it out.  Once again, Apple can't fucking work with some other company.  What a shock.  Don't work and play well with others. 
[02:02:30]  Apple just can't.  Wonder why Windows is an 80% of the fucking computers in the world.  Yeah, but the 20% are so cool.  I wonder why that is.  80%.  And Windows stinks as far as their fucking operating systems go.  Fucking freeze up, crashy asshole things.  On the iPhone.  Oh.  You got it working?  The browser.  It's all good now?  I think it's a browser thing because, uh.  Safari on this iPad sucks my fucking grandmother's dad. 
[02:03:00]  I have a backup browser that I downloaded.  It's like a dollar or whatever.  Browser.  So it seems the problem that Jimmy is having on his iPad, I'm not having.  It's Safari.  I'm not having.  It's Safari.  You didn't get to order the chocolate for your sister yet?  I'm ordering it right now.  So it's working.  Yeah, but it's still a pain in the ass.  No, I have to get one for my.  Is Ray here?  Ray's blowing us off.  No, Roland's downstairs.  He might be bringing him up now.  But Roland.  Sorry that I called you an asshole.  You called me an asshole?  Yeah, it was a little harsh.  Why'd you call Sam an asshole?  Because he goes to vacation thing.  Why? 
[02:03:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Well, I wasn't taking a shot.  I was just being sarcastic.  But Sam is an asshole.  That's true.  I mean, yeah.  I didn't take it as a criticism.  I take my apology back.  Sam is an asshole.  More of a character evaluation.  Make sure your mom brings some cookies in Monday.  Monday?  She just gave you pies and cake.  Peanut butter cookies and chocolate chip cookies.  Thank you.  On Monday.  And the chocolate chip, the peanut butter cookies got to like kind of fall apart.  You know, right?  Well, I mean, she could just bring in the peanut butter cookies.  Daddy knows.  It's the only way to make them.  Yeah.  They fucking, they can't stay together. 
[02:04:00]  What if she makes what she makes?  They stay together.  It's not a good fucking peanut butter cookie.  Make sure Bobby knows that.  Thank you.  What if she makes what she makes?  Are you still talking?  What do you mean makes what she makes?  She makes what we say.  That's right.  Oh.  She makes what we say now.  Because we own her now.  If we're going to take out Marcia Stewart, she's got to understand that we now own her.  I always wondered why she didn't start her own like baking shop.  But in like two weeks, you guys have made it clear why she wouldn't want to turn this  into a business.  Why?  Because now it's becoming work.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:04:30]  What do you think we're doing right now?  We're working.  Everyone works.  You're getting paid.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  What?  Do you know a guy that was at BAB that owns a club called SL?  No.  SL.  Down in Meatpacking?  Yeah.  Some guy down there.  I went to a party last night at SL down there in Meatpacking.  What's his name?  I don't know.  Was it maybe Kevin or something like that?  I have no idea.  Maybe something. 
[02:05:00]  Keith would know if he's listening.  Just text me.  SL.  I don't even dress for a club.  Did you get caught stealing cold cuts?  And you said, if they're free, I ain't stealing.  SL in the Meatpacking.  Yeah.  Some old guy from BAB.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Now, down there.  It's like fucking.  What did he do for BAB?  I think it was like one of your interns or some shit.  I don't even know.  I need a picture or something.  Keith brought it up, but it was, you know, it was getting late.  But, well, here's what happened.  It was a party for a modeling agency. 
[02:05:30]  Holy shit.  Dude.  Holy shit.  All I could think of is the Seinfeld episode where George Costanza had the picture of his  girlfriend.  He said it was his fiancee.  That's the manhands episode.  The manhands face.  It was her picture without her manhands.  And then he said it's a picture of his fiancee.  And all the models are like, would you like to dance?  And he's like, I'm in, Jerry.  I'm on the inside.  I, that's how I felt walking into this place. 
[02:06:00]  It was nothing but chicks that were 5'11 and taller in high-heeled shoes, short little  skirts, just walking around like fucking, every girl was a fucking 11 walking around  in this place.  And I'm just sitting there.  Thank God you put the uh in there.  What were you doing?  Every girl was.  You were just sitting there? 
[02:06:30]  No, I was, I was talking with Melissa.  Were you socializing?  Because it's her agent.  She signed with that agency.  Very cool.  And uh, I am, guess, guess, guess where I'm going next, next Thursday.  Oh boy.  That means Friday's show is going to be hell.  No, no, no.  It's not really a drinking event or anything.  But you turn everything into a drinking event.  Well, that is true.  Last night I did go out.  Bill Schultz from Red Eye went out as the Red Eye.  And we told you you would.  And you were almost mad at us for suggesting you might go out last night. 
[02:07:00]  I didn't go out.  I went out.  Yeah, whatever.  Going out is going out.  I just went out.  I'm not, whatever.  I'm just saying, I don't care.  Yeah.  I don't want you to think I care.  It's just funny that.  The Red Eye people.  Where are you going next Thursday?  Next Thursday, I get to go to a runway fashion show.  Oh, really?  In the fashion district.  Nice.  You know, it's fashion week is coming up or some shit.  Isn't fashion week every other month?  It's like fashion month or some shit.  I don't know.  They have a lot of fashion weeks, I think.  But she's doing a runway show. 
[02:07:30]  Do you get front row stuff?  No, I think they...  Or is she working at an airport or something?  No, not that kind of runway, Chip.  Oh, gosh.  Look, look, look.  You're incorrigible.  Yeah.  We're incorrigible.  Save that thought because Ray's on his way up and we definitely should break before we  get him in here, okay?  Not to put the stupid breaks on this, but we'll talk about the modeling thing later.  I just want people to know so that next Thursday when it happens, I'll have a full report  on what being a fashion show is like.  That'll be pretty cool.  Jesus.  All right.  Ray Kurzweil, the inventor and futurist, will be on our show next. 
[02:08:00]  Should be some good radio.  Stay there.  This is Brian Cox.  Hey, this is Chaz Palminteri.  Hey, this is Danny McBride.  Hey, this is David DeCover.  Hey, this is Michael Madsen.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  I don't know why, but I'm still trying to figure out what the hell the show's about. 
[02:08:30]  Hey, really fast.  First, I finally was able to put the J-Lo's ass makes Mars go bang video together.  I made a video within a video.  Of course, the big Jennifer Lopez walking by the studio video is up on my YouTube channel,  Opie Radio.  And then we all noticed that Mars, like, completely lost his fucking mind when J-Lo walked by the  studio.  So I made a separate video that's about 26 seconds long.  And I had a tough time uploading it for a couple days, but I finally figured out the fucking 
[02:09:00]  bug in my iMovie.  And it's up there if you want to check it out.  Thank God.  Go to Opie Radio on YouTube.  J-Lo's ass makes Mars go bang.  Although people are now starting to look at Danny's performance in the video.  Danny's Oh My God is a biggie.  People are loving the Oh My God Danny hat.  They're also loving how Danny was holding on to Travis, waiting for the moment.  You have to understand.  Like a little kid.  Like he was holding on to Travis.  Like, here it comes.  Because when you're into ass, like me, I'm a cheeks guy. 
[02:09:30]  Like, if you have titties, that's great, but it's really not going to do anything for  me.  Well, I'm not going to say that, but I'm more about the ass than I am about the titties.  I understand.  So when you see a Jennifer Lopez, you know, who's like, you know, between her and Kim Kardashian,  they're like the two, you know, queens of ass cheeks.  If Mars didn't go ghetto, you would have been the star of that 26 second video.  Because you're Oh My God, you're holding on to Travis.  It's classic.  It's like finding out Santa Claus is real.  You know, it's like you see pictures and you're like, I don't know. 
[02:10:00]  Is it a mess?  Does it really look like that?  I don't know.  I don't know.  And then you see it and it's amazing.  And the other thing I noticed in the latest version of the video is, is Mars's crotch grab.  He had to grab his crotch at the end of the whole thing too.  Oh, quickly.  Yes.  They play music in and out of the news a lot now.  Yeah.  They just played something and I heard it this morning.  It's called the Hey Football Song from Arena Themes.  It's Gary Glitter's song, but they don't put it as Gary Glitter. 
[02:10:30]  It's the Hey Football Song.  Oh, wow.  And the artist, it says Arena Themes.  Yeah, they're erasing him from history.  He's being just fucking Stalinized out of fucking history.  But they know it's the greatest sports anthem of all time.  So they can't get rid of the song.  Yeah.  We have a genius outside.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Sorry.  Yeah, we're talking about J-Lo's ass.  J-Lo's ass in football.  And a kid toucher.  That's true.  Ray Kurz.  I'm sorry, Ray.  Ray Kurzweil.  Sorry about that, sir. 
[02:11:00]  Do you always travel with that many books?  Wow.  That's like, you're like very studious.  And Barry, the director of this movie that I really liked.  That's great.  That's Anthony.  Hi, I'm Anthony.  How are you?  You're a genius.  Oh, my God.  This is what I need.  The singularity is near.  Oh, my God.  Does it have to be 800 pages?  Can't you just say it in...  Oh, my God.  Small font, too.  Nine steps for living well forever.  This guy can write.  Oh, my God. 
[02:11:30]  Wow.  I feel like I'm back in high school.  Oh, my God.  Hi, Ray.  Nice to meet you, sir.  Ray, pleasure.  See, I was actually talking about this recently.  Ascent Technologies can optimize the complex logistics of an airport.  I was saying that to somebody recently.  Yeah.  Jimmy.  Very smart guy.  He smells good, too, by the way.  Whatever you're wearing, it's very good.  Science.  Yeah, I know.  Bunsen burner fluid.  I'll lend you some. 
[02:12:00]  Well, you've had quite a life.  We've got to just get right into this.  The movie, we're talking about Transcendent Man, right?  Yes.  And me and Jimmy saw it and saw a little bit of it, but he was very busy last night doing  some other things.  I was at a modeling party.  Oh, my God.  He went to a modeling party, Ray.  And the movie starts off with you on Steve Allen's show.  Right.  That was 1965.  1965.  That's when there was only three television stations, the three networks. 
[02:12:30]  Right.  Yeah.  Very easy to run through the channels back then.  And how old were you?  We were trying to figure out.  17.  You were 17 and you built a computer.  I was 17 and looked 12.  Yeah.  Yeah, you looked a lot younger.  So you're 17, you built a computer that could actually create music, right?  Right.  It was my first pattern recognition project.  I would feed in melodies from famous composers.  They would figure out the patterns and write original music in the same style.  See, that's amazing, especially back then.  Yeah.  I mean, what kind of background in training did you have to be able to do this? 
[02:13:00]  Because most people can't just go to Radio Shack and start soldering.  Well, I've always done projects on my own.  That's what little I've learned.  I've learned from my own projects.  I think we should actually do that with kids today, bring entrepreneurship into junior high  school and high school.  Oh, absolutely.  I mean, look at what college kids have done.  A couple of college kids started Facebook.  Seven years ago today, by the way.  Or Google.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And so we should do that in high schools and junior high schools. 
[02:13:30]  So I've been doing my own projects since I was five.  So you just kind of started taking, self-pinkering?  What were you doing at five, though?  Well, my parents gave me all these enrichment toys, erector sets.  And you just started building real stuff.  And I had this idea if I put them together in just the right way, you could create magical  effects.  See, that's something.  I would just be like, oh, look, I made a pulley work with the little motor and the  little hook.  I just don't have erector sets.  Anthony used to take things apart to see how they worked. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, I was always tinkering.  But Ray was just born a genius.  I think he was just born a genius.  There's a difference between taking things apart and then leaving them there and actually  putting them back together again or changing them for the better.  I would take things apart and then cry until my parents bought me a new one.  And I did some of that.  The computer on Steve Allen's show there was quite large, sir.  Computers were large back then.  I mean, when I went to MIT in 65, a computer took a path for building.  Wow.  So the computer on your belt is a thousand times more powerful than the computer all of us 
[02:14:30]  shared.  And you kind of saw this coming.  I had some sense of this exponential growth in the early 80s.  About 30 years ago, I really noticed that and actually collected data and developed this  theory that information technology, like computers, like communication devices, biological technologies  grow exponentially in a very predictable manner.  Now, how was that known so early on? 
[02:15:00]  Basically, they double every year in power for the same cost.  How did you figure that out so early on, though, that this was going to happen?  This was kind of a formula.  Well, I mean, I had decided at age five to be an inventor.  And it took me a couple of decades to realize that the key to being successful was really  get the timing right.  So Mark Zuckerberg did his thing at just the right time.  Larry Page and Sergey Brin developed a search engine at just the right time. 
[02:15:30]  So I began to study how technology evolves.  And I collected a lot of data.  And I actually didn't expect that it would be predictable, because the common wisdom is  you can't predict the future.  But these trends, like the power of a computer per dollar, or bits of memory per dollar, or  the number of bits we're moving around on the internet, or the number of bits we move  around wirelessly in the air.  Or if you plot these things, they follow very smooth, predictable, exponential trajectories.  Well, you've invented a lot of things, too. 
[02:16:00]  And one of the more impressive things was the thing that it's like it takes a photo of  a page, and it reads it to a blind person.  And you go, all right, well, blind people could always read Braille.  But Stevie Wonder had a good point.  He said that's the first time that blind people have ever been able to read their own private  information by themselves.  Like, you know, if there's paperwork, how does that work, what you invented?  Well, very often, technologies that start for the disabled end up helping everyone.  The telephone, actually, was first developed for the deaf as a technology to help the deaf 
[02:16:30]  actually see what people are saying.  And a little offshoot of that was the telephone.  So this technology that I developed in the 70s was actually the first flatbed scanner, which  is now ubiquitous.  And it was the first character recognition that could recognize any type style.  So that's pretty ubiquitous.  And it was the first computer that could speak.  So speech synthesis, when you have a computer now talking to you, we invented that in the 
[02:17:00]  70s.  So we put those together into a machine.  And you put a page on it, scanned it like it was a Xerox copier, and it would read it  out loud.  So that's the first time that a computer could do that.  That was in 76.  This is why I was dying to know about this thing, because it takes a picture of the whole  page.  How do you know you're holding it properly over the page, and not just kind of snapping  half of one page and half of the other?  You can feel around, right?  Yeah.  It actually had some intelligence to figure out the format of the page, if there are pictures,  columns, if it's cutting off half the column, or if the page is crooked. 
[02:17:30]  I think he figured it out, Jim.  But I knew there was a method to it, but I just didn't know how it would work, because  you're blind, so you can't see where the words start or what's on the page.  And the book is called The Singularity is Near.  Could you please explain that?  You sort of started, but where does this all go?  So one key idea that I mentioned is that information technology, like computers, grow in this exponential  manner.  Exponential means it's doubling every period of time, like every year.  That doesn't sound like much, but you keep doubling, and if you double 30 times, you get 
[02:18:00]  to a billion.  And that's not our intuition.  Our intuition is that things progress linearly, like one, two, three, four, five.  So 30 steps later, you're at 30.  That's the intuition of even very sophisticated people.  I've had these debates with Nobel Prize winners.  And the reality of information technology is this exponential growth, so things are very  surprising.  So I saw, for example, the predecessor to the internet in the early 80s called the ARPANET  doubling every year, but it only was communicating between a few thousand scientists. 
[02:18:30]  So I predicted that in the mid-90s, there would be this worldwide network connecting hundreds  of millions of people, and people thought that was nuts.  But that's the power of exponential growth.  If you follow that out, where this is headed, by 2045, we will enhance our own intelligence  a billion-fold by merging with intelligent computers that we're creating.  That's the singularity. 
[02:19:00]  Is the time frame, one question somebody had, they said, you're probably right, but they  thought you were being a bit optimistic about the time.  Do you think that that time frame is kind of optimistic?  I think it's right on.  I think, first of all, since I've been doing this, these trends have stayed right on course.  Some people say, okay, the hardware is growing exponentially, but software is not.  But that's not true either.  Look at this IBM computer called Watson that's playing Jeopardy, and able to actually figure 
[02:19:30]  out subtle metaphors and jokes and puns and deal with all the vagaries of human language  at the level of the best human players on the planet.  That's, if anything, ahead of schedule.  So when I say that by 2029, a computer will be able to have all the facility of human language  that humans have, which has been one of my predictions, that looks pretty good in light  of this Jeopardy playing computer today. 
[02:20:00]  Now, we were talking earlier, before you got here, about the fact that we are all individuals.  We have some type of strange, divine spark in us that makes you, you, me, me.  And this seems to me to be at least one thing that cannot be reproduced.  You can program a computer to have some sense of independent thought, but I don't think you're  ever going to get a computer to be as close to a human, because we all do have this strange 
[02:20:30]  individuality.  Well, you're getting at a profound philosophical issue.  I know, I do this all the time.  And it's a good one.  It's important, though.  In my mind, that spark comes from the pattern that makes you who you are.  So your molecules and your cells organized in a certain way that can interact with information,  respond to me with a certain personality and set of skills. 
[02:21:00]  And ultimately, we can capture that, and we can recreate it, and we can expand on it.  And that will have that spark if it has the pattern.  So that would mean that at some point in history and in time that a computer will be able to  say, hey, get your hands off me, you damn dirty human, and just leave me alone.  They can say that now.  And if you play sophisticated...  But mean it.  I mean, but mean it. 
[02:21:30]  Right.  So you can play a video game today and meet characters.  Like Second Life, which is featured in the movie.  Second Life or multiplayer games.  Never quest them.  Never quest them.  Never quest them.  You can meet some character that's human-like that says, get your hands off me.  You don't believe it today, because it doesn't have all the subtle cues that really convince  you it's real.  Well, my prediction is in 20 years, they will be so realistic, you won't be able to tell  them apart from real humans, and we will accept them as having real emotions. 
[02:22:00]  And when they say, I'm angry, I'm jealous, you'll believe them, and that those will be  real emotions.  But will they be real, or will they actually be angry and jealous?  Or will they be just great, great convincing copies?  Right.  Mimics, right.  That's a deep philosophical issue that goes back 2,000 years to play the platonic dialogue.  But what do you think?  I think it's real if it seems real, but that's my philosophical belief.  It's actually not a scientific question.  There's no scientific test you can do that would absolutely definitively answer that. 
[02:22:30]  More spiritual.  You know, I just, this is what a phony I am.  I just said, right, like I knew that there was no scientific test.  But I really did.  There could be 30 of them, and I would have no idea.  I just didn't want to sound dumb.  I'm fascinated with the idea that if a computer did reach a point where it could be angry,  it could be sad, it could be jealous, that it would just shut off at some point when  you really needed it because it was angry with you.  It could literally turn itself off or not perform the functions in which you want it  to because it was angry with you. 
[02:23:00]  Well, computers are mastering human emotions.  Even this Jeopardy playing computer now has to understand something about human emotions,  or you couldn't play that game very well.  Right, because some of the questions are based in...  Understanding of human emotion.  Right, sarcasm.  Exactly.  Little idiosyncrasies in the way a word is said.  So they're getting there.  If you go out 20 years, computers will be millions of times more powerful than they are today, 
[02:23:30]  and they really will be very convincing at that time.  I know you said that when you saw a few scientists at colleges communicating with each other  through the primitive version of the Internet, that you foresaw a large number of people  communicating with each other.  Did you have any concept that it was going to be what it is now,  in that we're trading more than just intellectual property?  We're trading pornography, we're trading ideas that would seem very radical. 
[02:24:00]  Well, actually, I wrote in my first book, which I wrote in the 80s,  when the Soviet Union was going strong,  that the Soviet Union would be swept away by this emerging social network.  I called that myself back in the 70s.  I really did.  I told my friends, I go, I give the Soviet Union another 20 years,  because information, or the lack thereof,  is what keeps their people under their thumb, and the second it gets out...  That's very insightful, and that's exactly what happened.  I just didn't write a book.  And he didn't say it like that, by the way. 
[02:24:30]  He was drunk.  He went, the fucking Russians ain't going to last.  I picked that up.  You were there, Jimmy.  I picked that up at a party with you, and I stole it from you.  I know.  That's what I was getting at.  Well, the same thing is kind of happening with the Middle East,  with the information that is getting to everybody,  and how they're communicating with each other.  Social networks are very democratizing.  Right.  And now that they're very powerful, and everybody in the world is on them,  you know, there's 600 million people on Facebook.  It's a very powerful political phenomenon. 
[02:25:00]  But that happened in that 91 coup against Gorbachev.  There was a clandestine social network of primitive fax machines  and teletype machines, and everybody was in the know,  and the authorities didn't have control of information anymore.  Right.  It's also democratizing in terms of being creative.  It used to be you had to be a big organization to do a big project,  and now you have a couple of kids at Harvard to create Facebook,  a couple of kids with $1,000 laptops create Google.  Do you think China is going to have to go through a phase where they've been very good 
[02:25:30]  at keeping their people in the dark, at least their masses?  They have a certain core group that is very good with business and their communist capitalism.  They're not in the dark.  I mean, there are 200 million blogs in China.  But they're very restrictive, the government, on what their people can access.  Actually, if you read some of those blogs, not that you can master 200 million blogs,  but they're very freewheeling.  They have to stay away.  You don't want to head your post saying, 
[02:26:00]  my thoughts on Tiananmen Square or what's wrong with Tibet.  There's a few issues you want to stay away from.  Keep some keywords out of your posts.  Otherwise, they're pretty freewheeling.  Basically, they're buying off their people with economic growth.  Right, right.  So as long as they can keep up this 10% per year growth,  it's kind of keeping the lid on social unrest.  Don't you think at some point the impoverished,  which I think make up a majority of China, 
[02:26:30]  I believe in the bigger cities you're getting people that are in on the whole business end  and capitalism that's running rampant over their time.  And those bigger cities are attracting people from the rural areas.  I think China will move towards democracy.  It's hard to predict exactly what the course will be,  but I think it's irresistible once you have this communication out there.  The communication is there.  It's very pervasive.  And the people know what's going on,  and it will lead inevitably to some kind of democratization. 
[02:27:00]  You were saying something about, and I've always thought this too,  they were going to put chips, like what's that, in people and stuff,  and we would eventually integrate with computers.  But then you said something I didn't agree with at the end.  You said eventually that you think, like I do believe in the cell-sized,  just to check astronauts, you know, when they're traveling,  when you're three years away from a doctor,  you have to have something that will check you.  And inside you are constantly checking you.  But then you said something about the trees and rocks.  And will there ever really be a time where we have these inanimate objects, 
[02:27:30]  trees maybe for a photosynthesis or whatever, but rocks,  will there ever be a need for them to have any computerization?  Because you said that.  I didn't agree with that point.  Well, the point is that we're going to turn matter and energy  into intelligent computers.  I mean, that's actually the natural resource we need to expand our intelligence  is to turn more and more material into intelligent computation.  So a rock actually has an enormous amount of computation.  There's all these molecules bouncing against each other, 
[02:28:00]  and there's a tremendous amount of computation going on in a rock,  but it's disorganized and useless today.  We will reorganize it into being a useful computer.  How about in Egypt, Jimmy?  How about a rock that can go around a corner?  Huh? They could use that?  Right?  Or Iran in a rock.  I want to get back to the movie, Transcendent Man.  And you were talking about computers and becoming more human-like,  and one of the subjects in the movie was bringing your dad back. 
[02:28:30]  You lost your dad when he was 58 years old,  and you're convinced that in the future you could actually bring him back,  so to speak.  Well, first of all, we will be able to create artificial intelligences  that have the personality of people and even specific people  based on the information we have about them.  So we could create an artificial person, let's say,  in some artificial environment like Second Life,  but unlike Second Life today that's kind of cartoon-like, 
[02:29:00]  it'll be very realistic, and this person will be very realistic  and would have the personality of my father based on what we know about him.  So what do we know about him?  Well, I have all of his letters, I have all of his music,  I have movies and pictures.  These future AIs can go inside my brain and extract my memories.  We can get his DNA from his gravesite.  That's not definitive, but that's a piece of information.  And you take all that information and create a person that's consistent with that. 
[02:29:30]  Now, is that my father?  You can certainly argue that it's not,  but it actually would be more similar to my father than my father would be  if he were alive today.  And would it grow and learn and become what your father would have been  had he, you know, another ten years?  Would he have, would this, would this...  You'd be creating a person, you know, like my father  and like any other person would then, from that point on,  grow and evolve and interact with their environment and learn things. 
[02:30:00]  So it wouldn't just be a stagnant, at that age,  and that's what you'd have to deal with, it would actually learn.  Do you think memories can be extracted, though?  Like, is it, like, because we don't know exactly how they're...  Is there a way for me to take Opie's memories or your memories  and actually see them as you saw them?  Not today, but we're actually...  Memories are in the neocortex, that's where we remember things.  We don't remember them as flat text, like in a book.  They're actually these structures where you have a whole bunch of symbols  and it forms an idea and then we give that idea and a symbol 
[02:30:30]  and we take that symbol and use it with other symbols for another idea  and it's organized in hierarchies.  That's done in the neocortex.  And we actually have a pretty good idea how that works  and there are simulations of portions of the neocortex.  Again, this IBM Watson machine is actually based on loosely  a functional simulation of the neocortex.  It's organizing information in a similar way.  So we don't know everything about it. 
[02:31:00]  We don't know enough to actually go inside someone's brain now  and pull out memories, but we're understanding those principles.  I think we will be able to do that in a few decades.  I would like a...  Because it's always fascinated me that you can form a picture in your mind.  That, to me, has always been fascinating,  that you can shut your eyes or open them, whatever you want,  but actually see something in your head.  If you think of a tiger, you see it, not through your eyes,  but you visually see it.  But you're actually imagining it fresh. 
[02:31:30]  If you try to think of a friend, you don't actually have a picture in your mind.  You have little clues and features of that person  and then if you try to think about them,  your mind will actually fantasize that person's face  from the information you remember about them.  We don't actually remember things in the detail that we think we do.  And we can't access our memories unless they're triggered by something else.  But I would like to be able to tap into that  and someday almost print it out or put it to some type of video 
[02:32:00]  where you could see what you're thinking and pictures and...  It'd be like a combination of barfly and lolita.  We have all kinds of things in our brains that we don't even know are there  and we can't access easily unless something triggers them.  And there's nothing in our brains that requires all the ideas  to be consistent with each other.  So people have all these ideas that are actually inconsistent  and there's nothing in our brains unless we do critical thinking 
[02:32:30]  that will make sure that there is consistency.  Another thing from the movie that was really fascinating was mortality.  Like you want to live forever, sir.  Who wouldn't?  Well, but I think most of us...  I'd like that decision in my own hands.  He said he doesn't accept...  You said that you don't accept that.  You don't want to accept that we all have to die.  Like we all learned very early on,  well, you know, we only have so much time and we're going to die,  but you don't want to accept that.  And you think in the future that there's a possibility 
[02:33:00]  we don't have to accept that.  And you're hoping it happens before your time is up.  Our philosophies are to celebrate death.  It's giving life meaning.  It makes time short.  But actually, if you consider our visceral reaction to someone dying,  it's that it's a great tragedy.  And I think that's the right reaction.  It's a tremendous loss of knowledge and skill and relationships  and love and creativity.  That's what's there.  And the reality is whenever we're given the opportunity 
[02:33:30]  to extend human life, we do.  Right.  And that's not a new story.  Human life expectancy was 20,000 years ago.  It was 37 in 1,800.  Every time there's some advance, there's no controversy.  Should we use this new advance for cancer?  The only question is, does it really work?  And my thesis is that these advances are going to come faster and faster  because of this exponential growth.  And now that health and medicine is itself an information technology,  which it didn't used to be, 
[02:34:00]  this is going to go into high gear.  And people can wax philosophically all day long  that, oh, death is noble and gives meaning to life  and life will be meaningless without it.  The reality is as these advances come faster and faster,  we're going to adopt them without controversy.  Right.  With physics, and I know very little about physics, obviously.  Nothing.  But, I mean, I know the word string theory, and I drop it at parties all the time.  Is that a word?  You'll do tremendously well if you want to be alone. 
[02:34:30]  If you want to dip to yourself, say string theory, chicks will clear.  You're going to the wrong party.  Is that, when you think of physics and breaking things down,  is string theory accurate at all?  Or are you not that familiar with it?  Because I know very little about it other than...  There's actually dozens of different string theories.  Sure.  Yeah.  It seems to be...  The reality seems to be indeterminate at that level, 
[02:35:00]  and there are different theories that fit the evidence we have.  My thesis doesn't require any assumptions about the string theory.  It's just based on well-established knowledge about molecules and atoms  and how we can compute with molecules, which we're doing already  and just following the kind of progression we see.  I mean, you just buy an iPhone today.  It's twice as good for half the money as the one two years ago.  That's a quadrupling of price performance. 
[02:35:30]  And that's because we're making parts smaller and smaller,  and it's a very predictable phenomenon.  So you don't need to get into these vagaries of physics to appreciate that.  I want to go back to the life expectancy, something that we could grasp.  Like, how is that going to grow?  Right now, what is the life expectancy of a man?  Seventy-five, six, somewhere around there?  It was 37 in 1800.  It was 48 in 1900.  It's pushing 80 now.  Pushing 80, okay.  All of that progress has been just from a hit-or-miss process  where we would just find things that happen to work accidentally 
[02:36:00]  without really understanding how they work.  Health and medicine is now different.  It has now become an information process.  We're actually understanding the software of life, which are our genes.  And it's not a metaphor to say that those are software programs.  Your fat insulin receptor gene says, hold on to every calorie  because maybe your next hunting venture won't go so well.  And that was the reality when our genes evolved. 
[02:36:30]  You know, I'd like to tell my fat insulin receptor gene,  you don't need to do that.  I'm going to have food tomorrow.  Fat insulin receptor genes would be great pants for fat people.  So, thanks.  Jesus, Jim.  I'm sorry.  We try that in animals.  We turn that gene off.  These animals ate a lot and remained slim.  That will be a drug sometime over the next decade.  A nagel procedure, they call that.  I think it will be pretty popular.  That's just one of the genes we'd like to change.  In 10 years, what will the life expectancy be? 
[02:37:00]  1,000.  I'm domestic.  And is there a limit to the actual human body where there's no way it could continue?  I think we'll see real advances between 10 and 20 years from now  when these things really get into high gear.  Exponentials start out slowly,  and then when they get to kind of extreme part of the curve,  they start developing very quickly.  So I think we're going to be adding, in about 15 years from now,  we'll be adding more than a year every year to your remaining life expectancy. 
[02:37:30]  So they'll start stretching out in front of you.  It's not a guarantee of immortality,  but it will change to the metaphor of the sands of time running out.  Here's something I've got to ask you.  You've studied life and a lot of stuff since you were very young.  Have you enjoyed life?  Do you go out?  Have you crashed a car?  Have you had a few too many to drink?  Have you loved?  Have you sacrificed your own personal life to study life? 
[02:38:00]  Well, actually, I mean, I retired when I was five.  And I decided I would do what I wanted.  A great four years.  Yeah, I struggled those first four years.  So I've been having a good time.  I love to invent with ideas.  And I actually majored at MIT, not only in computer science, but creative writing.  So I've done a fair amount.  Have you gone a little crazy?  You know, have you just kind of, you know, off the rails every so often?  Maybe partied a little too much?  Or, you know, woke up with somebody that you didn't quite know as well as you should have? 
[02:38:30]  I went to a party once, yeah.  Do you remember at MIT when they built a computer to play Bobby Fischer?  He predicted that.  In chess.  He predicted the computer beating Kasparov.  Well, Kasparov and he beat him in 96, I want to say.  Right, right.  97.  Deep Blue defeated Kasparov.  Oh, yeah, he beat it in 96, right.  And I predicted that in my first book, which I wrote in the 80s.  And I also predicted that when that happened, what happened, that we would aim downgrade chess 
[02:39:00]  and say, well, chess isn't that big a deal after all.  Yeah, right.  Do you play?  I was going to ask you that because you have that kind of mind.  I think chess is too violent a game.  Offends me.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Jeez.  How are we going to interface?  Especially when the rook is on the queen and he won't get off.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How are we going to interface with computers and when will that happen?  Will we actually have stuff in our brain attached to the side?  How does that kind of work?  Yeah, the keyboard mouse is getting a little old.  Yeah. 
[02:39:30]  Conception in Matrix, whether it's this plug in the back of your head,  it's kind of ridiculous for now.  It could get infected, I think.  Smell.  There will be little robots the size of blood cells that will travel in your bloodstream,  which sends them everywhere in the body.  They'll have computers inside them.  They'll be communicating wirelessly to each other, to the Internet.  They'll interact with our biological neurons.  They'll go inside our brain and put our brains on the Internet  and expand our intelligence through cloud computing. 
[02:40:00]  And they'll have to be inserted.  You'll never be organically born with them.  They'll have to be inserted at birth?  Inserted, like taking a pill or inject it.  It would be like a medication, which will have millions of nanobots in it.  They'll augment your immune system.  They'll be like white blood cells, only smarter.  Like white blood cells don't recognize cancer cells.  It thinks it's you, which it is in a way.  But these can be much smarter and keep you healthy from inside 
[02:40:30]  and also go in your brain and make you smarter.  Now, you just explained something that's going to take a lot of years, obviously, right?  Well, these scenarios are in the 2030s.  2030s.  Okay.  What I want to ask, knowing that, what can we look forward to in the next five years?  We were just talking about how five years ago none of us had BlackBerrys and iPhones,  and we thought, wow, we could text, and look what we've done in five years.  Every new phone you got was like, wow, this is great.  And now you look back five years and go, what a piece of crap I had. 
[02:41:00]  So over the next 10 years, we're going to move away from these little devices we hold in our hands.  Images will be written directly to our retina from our eyeglasses.  The electronics will be just somewhere in our belt buckle, and we'll have wireless.  We'll be online all the time.  Search engines won't wait for you to ask them a question.  It'll be listening to your conversation, see that you're getting stuck on something,  and there are little pop-ups in your visual field of view helping you out.  In five years, pretty cool.  You look at someone, it'll remind you who they are, and it's their birthday next Tuesday, 
[02:41:30]  and we'll be in augmented reality.  There's already some very interesting augmented reality apps on the iPhone,  but this will become much more intimate.  There'll be full immersion virtual reality.  People will interact physically and sensually from far apart.  We can be someone else in a virtual reality environment.  Do you see anything detrimental as far as, because people even say now with texting and Twitter  that we're not communicating with each other, not as personal with each other face-to-face. 
[02:42:00]  Do you see anything detrimental in that?  I think it's pretty personal, if you've spent any time on Facebook.  We just have other ways to communicate.  I mean, if you're meeting somebody and it's putting their name and birthday and everything,  doesn't that kind of take it off of you to remember those things?  And isn't that part of us, that we should have to remember who someone is if we care about them  and when their birthday is, and it kind of takes the burden off of us. 
[02:42:30]  That might have an effect.  They were talking about that when I was in high school about we don't have to do arithmetic anymore,  and kids aren't going to learn how to do long division because of all these calculators.  But computers are always relieving us at the lower end and freeing us up, actually, to be more creative.  We shouldn't be teaching kids to learn facts and stuffing their minds with facts that will be on their belt buckle.  Anyway, we should learn them to do critical thinking, to be creative, to do their own projects. 
[02:43:00]  You know, when I was in college, I had a computer minor, and I learned all those computer languages.  By the time I graduated, all those languages didn't mean anything.  I was like, what a waste of time.  No, but you learned some principles of computing and how to think logically and how to break down situations.  If then.  Come on, if then.  If then.  Remember if then?  Sure.  If then is pretty profound.  We didn't love basic.  It was profound.  Do you think that...  Cobalt.  Come on.  Cobalt, Jesus.  We didn't love that.  Turtle Pascal.  It was fun. 
[02:43:30]  With exponential growth, how many years will it take before AT&T is actually a viable phone service?  That's the one pessimistic thing he's got.  That will never happen.  I actually heard their CEO recently, and he said this year they're going to turn it around.  So...  More importantly, something we have joked about on this show for so long, the flying car.  When?  We all thought growing up that we would see a flying car. 
[02:44:00]  That's going to take nanotechnology instead of micro wings, and so that's 2030s.  But we already have driverless cars.  Google cars have driven 140,000 miles without human drivers through the cities and towns of California.  I'd rather commute with them around me.  That's for sure.  They probably know to get the hell out of the left lane when I'm behind them.  I think sighted human drivers haven't done a very good job.  No, they haven't.  I think the flying car thing is more a problem with people. 
[02:44:30]  It would have to be very automated.  You can't give people the freedom for three dimensions when they can't control something in two.  It's terrible.  There's a lot more space up there.  I think...  A lot more space for people to screw up.  Well, less opportunity to crash into each other, but it definitely will be computerized.  Yeah.  What about overpopulation, though?  Because they've always talked about colonizing.  That's why they're looking for moons and all that stuff.  With people not having the life expectancy of 150 or whatever it is, when does overpopulation become a problem? 
[02:45:00]  It's not going to become a problem.  We're awash in resources.  We have 10,000 times more sunlight than we need to meet all of our energy needs.  And these new technologies will unlock those resources.  Solar energy is growing exponentially.  It's doubling every two years.  It's only eight doublings for meeting all of our energy needs.  We have lots of water.  It just happens to be dirty or salinated.  But with ultimately very inexpensive energy, we can clean it up. 
[02:45:30]  We have the technologies to do that.  There are new food technologies.  We'll grow meat without animals by cloning muscle tissue.  I mean, in each area, these new technologies will provide the resources for an expanded biological population.  You look very healthy.  I'm sitting next to you, and I'm looking at you very closely.  You look like a very healthy guy.  And I know you take a lot of pills.  Well, people think I look pretty good for 95.  You do?  Some people think I don't look a day over 80. 
[02:46:00]  You're a great 95, average 50.  Do you think that, like, what is, I know you have a program that you actually sell.  Well, I've written three health books, two with a co-author, Terry Grossman, M.D.  We talk about three bridges to radical life extension.  And bridge one is basically what you can do right now.  And there's a lot you can do right now to stop or slow down aging processes.  And so it's a long discussion.  For example, the cell membrane depletes a certain substance, phosphatidylcholine. 
[02:46:30]  That's why the skin in an elderly person becomes rigid and wrinkled.  And you can reverse that by supplementing with that substance.  So that's an easy one.  A more difficult one is your arteries get clogged up with plaque that causes heart attacks.  But it also causes impotence in men and people's claudication of your limbs.  And you can reverse that.  It's a little more complicated.  But we actually have the knowledge to do that with the right program.  Do you take stuff for all of that? 
[02:47:00]  I take 150 pills a day.  Wow.  Is that OCD though?  Honestly, do you have an OCD with that?  Like is that – because you save everything.  You have everything that your dad had.  I imagine you're a bit of a pack rat.  Like you said, you're a pack rat.  Does that also go into like an OCD type of thing?  Well, it's actually a well-thought-out program.  I mean I don't – eventually I won't have to take these pills.  We'll have a few pills that can do what we have to work very hard to do now. 
[02:47:30]  But that's – so today these programs are not trivial.  If you're healthy and you're in your 20s, there's not a lot you have to do.  If you're 50s or 60s, even if you're healthy, these aging processes start to accelerate and you need to do more.  So it's not a one-size-fits-all program.  It depends on what your issues are.  And I have some genetic issues.  I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes when I was 35, but I've had no indication of it for 25 years because of this program. 
[02:48:00]  Do you think Cialis?  That's my favorite pill.  Cialis and Allegra D, you know, for the stuffiness.  Well, we have things to overcome all kinds of disabilities.  They argue about vitamins all the time.  A lot of people think they don't, you know, do anything for you and you just kind of crap them out.  Well, vitamins is not – vitamins is not the main thing we advocate, although there's a lot of evidence for vitamin D that that really reduces the risk of heart disease and cancer. 
[02:48:30]  I mean, we could have a long discussion.  What people call vitamin E is really not vitamin E.  It's one particular substance, alpha-tocopherol.  It's not the right form of vitamin E.  So this could take up a long discussion, but most of the supplements I take are not particularly vitamins.  Okay.  Gotcha. 
[02:49:00]  Is it like – say you want to take a bunch of things – they actually just put me on vitamin D because I'm deficient.  Yeah, I know.  Everybody is.  Yeah.  And I want to, you know, 2,000 milligrams a day.  I don't want anybody to be concerned.  And I also have to take – I have very high mercury, so I'm taking these pills that have sulfur.  So my urine smells like sulfur.  Too much sushi, huh?  Yeah.  High mercury.  Too much fish.  Very high.  We all have high mercury.  It was 44, and it's supposed to be 11.  Then you stopped eating thermometers.  Now it's 24. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  I just wanted to completely stop the discussion with a boring fact about myself.  Mission accomplished.  We also have Barry in the studio who's the director of this movie, Transcendent Man.  You want to explain the movie?  Because I don't think we really explained the movie to the people.  Well, I mean, it's about the life and ideas of Ray Kurzweil and his articulating of the concept of the singularity.  Right.  So we've kind of framed the ideas with Ray's story.  And as you guys brought up earlier, it kind of – we get into the father and son elements of his relationship with his father, which we thought people – it would resonate for people. 
[02:50:00]  And we followed him around.  I mean, after we hooked up with Ray, we were able to follow him around five countries for a couple years and made the movie.  Yeah.  There's a bunch of guys out there that think Ray's a little – he's lost it a little bit.  Well, you know, you have to spend – on the face of it, you know, he makes some claims that seem perhaps outlandish. 
[02:50:30]  But when you spend the time and you do the due diligence and you read his book or you just listen to him like you have on the show, I think you'd be hard-pressed to make that claim.  Yeah, because on the outset, you would just take something out of context and be like, that sounds crazy.  Right.  But then when you explain it in context, it does make sense.  You know, and again, it's that old gag that 10 years ago, if you would have said we'd be walking around with what in essence is a communicator from Star Trek, people would say, come on, stop. 
[02:51:00]  Absolutely.  I mean, even, you know, just flying from one side of the country to the other.  I mean, 100 years ago, it took, you know, three months to get across the country.  Amazing, yeah.  160 years ago.  And what's interesting is, I mean, when I make these predictions, people find them outlandish.  I wrote in the 90s about e-books and people would be reading – we wouldn't –  Oh, that's crazy.  We'd be moving away from paper books. 
[02:51:30]  People thought that was nuts.  But then when these things happen, it just becomes part of everyday reality.  It's remarkable how quickly everybody adapts to them.  It's because it's a progression, too.  It's not like we go from a big cathode ray tube that was in those – a TV that was in those big wood sarcophagus in our houses to a flat screen on the wall.  Sure.  You know, it was a slow progression.  That's exactly right.  And so –  Of course it is.  When people express incredulity at lifespans that are, you know, hundreds of years or more, it's not going to happen. 
[02:52:00]  And, you know, one day there will be a front-page announcement.  Yeah, because it just happens.  It happens in thousands of little steps.  And each step is not controversial.  And nobody – putting computers in your brains, who's going to allow that?  Well, it's happening today.  I mean, Parkinson's patients put computers in their brains.  And there's no demonstrations or pickets against that.  I think a lot of people – when you heard years ago in the 70s, I remember hearing computers in your home, why? 
[02:52:30]  What would you need them for?  Because everybody would – any scientist worth his salt would say, no, there's going to be a time where every home will have a computer.  And people would say, why?  What do I need this for?  But you'd never take into consideration, again, context that as time goes by, the reason to have a computer comes into play.  You know, if you plopped a computer down in front of somebody in the 70s, first of all, it would be very hard to get online. 
[02:53:00]  And they just wouldn't know what to do with it.  Right.  It would be really no use for it.  So, yeah, I see in 10, 20 years us doing things and having things and using things that now would just seem ridiculous.  It was like 1999, I can remember, like, because I lived at home until I was 30, as most responsible boys do.  But I remember my mother got a gateway because that was the big computer then.  And you had to see prompt, log on, and it was 14K, I think.  And I didn't – I was playing solitaire on it.  I didn't know how to get online.  And you thought it was amazing, right? 
[02:53:30]  But once I started downloading pornography, literally a photo.  But you know how the photo would come, a piece of the photo, a piece of the photo.  So, I mean, now it's like –  T's.  Those computers were T's.  Oh, it was almost –  But you started feet first.  Gutenberg's first book was the Bible, but then followed a whole sequence of Peoria titles.  Right.  So, pornography has been a big actual promoter of every media technology.  Isn't that amazing?  It's just – and we really try to repress that.  And it's just – I think we think we're a lot more like Vulcans than we really are. 
[02:54:00]  People like to forget that we're humans and we do like certain things, and there's no getting rid of that.  Well, I mean, technology is going to expand our potential in every way, intellectually, essentially.  Yeah.  And certainly it's used today for every kind of human purpose, and it is a double-edged sword, too.  I mean, there are dangers of these technologies.  Yeah, they – Barry, you go into that in the movie, right? 
[02:54:30]  Yeah.  There's a couple guys that with the AI technology, it scares the hell out of them because they don't know what that actually means in the end, where these machines could actually take over humans and destroy themselves in the world.  As Ray talks about – well, this comes up in popular culture where movies need a conflict to make it interesting.  So you have these dystopian movies like Terminator.  But the reality, as Ray articulates, is that there will not be an us-or-them situation because the AIs that we're creating currently are going to go inside of us and will evolve together. 
[02:55:00]  And there will never be a time where there's going to be AIs more intelligent than me or you will evolve together.  So that's really more likely what's going to happen.  Oh, right.  Okay, so as we evolve, they'll evolve, but they'll always be at a level below – they'll never –  No, it's not that they'll be beneath us, but my point is that they won't be above us.  We'll most likely start evolving together at a certain point here in the near future.  We're going to merge with them.  We're creating them as extensions of ourselves, and we're going to literally put them in our bodies and brains.  Do you see at some point an organic computer that will at some point become part of our genetic makeup? 
[02:55:30]  Like the way hair is kind of – it doesn't cover the whole body anymore or your hands get smaller or whatever?  Not exactly.  I mean, we're learning from biology how to do things, but then we do them better once we can strip away some of the inefficiencies of biology.  Like we're learning how the brain works, and that's actually the biggest thing that's stimulating AI.  But back on this promise versus peril, look today, we're using biotechnology to program biology away from cancer and heart disease. 
[02:56:00]  At the same time, the same techniques could be used by bioterrorists to create a superweapon, and these go hand in hand.  So some people say, oh, it's too dangerous.  Let's not do it.  Let's just not go down that road.  There's a whole intellectual movement called the Relinquishing Movement, and that's not realistic.  That's not going to happen.  I think that's always been the case with every great invention has been – there has been the potential for every great invention to be used for evil, as they say. 
[02:56:30]  Right, and it's real.  The answer, though, is to work on the dangers.  So we can put in a rapid response system where we can deactivate a new biological virus.  We do that with sulfur viruses.  I mean, honestly, do you think Alexander Graham Bell ever foresaw somebody picking the phone up, calling a bowling alley, and saying, do you have 10-pound balls?  Well, how do you walk?  I don't think he ever saw that, the evil part of the phone. 
[02:57:00]  That was actually the first thing he said on the phone.  He pranked the person in the next room.  It was after Watson, come quick, I need you.  And then he put his leg out and tripped him.  He actually said, hey, Watson, go look in the toilet.  A little toilet humor there, sir.  I'm sorry.  We can't get away from it.  Yeah, that's how we stay young.  Our audience is a little on the lowbrow side, so we've got to keep them engaged.  Lowbrow and high waistline.  Right.  Are you inventing anything right now as we sit here? 
[02:57:30]  Eat our audience.  What's your latest invention?  My latest invention is BLEO, B-L-I-O.  It's an e-reader that runs on...  It needed the money.  It's a free download, runs on any platform.  It's at B-L-I-O dot com.  It preserves the original format of the page.  Other e-readers throw that away and just give you this text flow.  It'll be the exclusive e-reader for Toshiba and HP and Dell computers. 
[02:58:00]  I apologize.  He's still laughing at my immature, horrid joke that I made.  He just didn't type it.  I apologize.  That's why I'm laughing.  We are.  I mean, it's in essence a new type of e-reader.  Right.  It's free.  It comes with 3 million free books.  3 million?  Yeah.  And we also sell books. 
[02:58:30]  That's our business model.  Wow.  That's awesome.  You're in a lot of stuff.  How many patents do you have?  Something like 40.  40 good ones.  Your quality, not so much quantity.  What seemed like a good idea that just turned out to be...  I was actually going to ask that.  What did you predict or want to do that didn't work?  Yeah, it was a bust.  Well, one prediction that I'd say was wrong is that we would have common driverless cars.  So we actually have the technology at some level, experimentally, but it's not being used commonly. 
[02:59:00]  So that seems to be about 10 years off.  Magnets, right?  Magnets.  They're going to use magnets in the road.  Magnets on the side of the road, magnets on the back of your car, on the front of their car.  I mean, we have...  All over the place.  There are cars now driving around, like these Google cars, without drivers.  On regular roads, yeah.  On regular roads, just using artificial intelligence and sensors.  Yeah, they're able to sense...  Autopilot on a plane.  I mean, you can do almost everything on a plane without the pilot, right? 
[02:59:30]  Planes fly and land without pilots.  Can they not take off without a pilot?  There's one thing they can't do without a pilot.  Is it take off?  I don't think they could land without a pilot.  They can land without a pilot.  They do need the pilot right now for taking off.  And the pilot's there to make sure no shenanigans happen, but with the ILS and autopilot, yeah.  But we watched a special on the crash of going from Brazil to...  No, Brazil to Paris. 
[03:00:00]  To Paris, yeah.  And they say the pilots are not as equipped to deal with stuff like mid-air stalls because  the computers are flying it for them.  So they don't have the hands-on that they did 15 years ago.  Yeah, sometimes the feedback that they're getting from the controls are actually giving  them the wrong sense of what's happening on the plane.  They should just leave it alone and let the autopilot take care of it, which is kind of  amazing when you think about it.  Well, computers are doing more than people think.  If we turned off all the intelligent computers in the world tomorrow, our whole civilization  would grow into a halt.  Ah, anarchy.  It would be great.  I want to get back to Barry, who's the director of Transcendent Man, which... 
[03:00:30]  Where is it going to open there, Barry?  Well, we had our premiere last night at the Time Life building.  It was a launch of a worldwide tour.  That's where all those hot groupies were.  They were hanging out outside.  Science groupies.  The movement has its own followers.  Yeah.  But we'll be in San Jose on the 13th.  We'll be in L.A. at the Lumley Royal on the 16th and 17th.  And then we'll come back to D.C., Boston, and London, and we're adding dates and cities.  And it's sold out, too, right? 
[03:01:00]  It was sold out and...  It's selling out.  And Barry, as a film...  I'm getting somewhere here.  Barry, as a film director, you got your start very early.  Very fascinating story.  You want to tell these guys I know, but you might want to tell them who you worked for.  Yeah, I was fortunate enough to...  Spielberg.  ...be on the set of E.T., the extraterrestrial, with Steven Spielberg.  Oh, okay.  At an early enough age where I wasn't a threat or I wasn't...  Holy shit, you were Elliot.  Well, we played Dungeons and Dragons with Henry Thomas and so on the set. 
[03:01:30]  But I had lunch with Steven every day in the cafeteria there on the set.  Why were you on the set?  How did you...  I trained animals.  My parents bought an animal park in 1979, and we trained animals in the off-season to be in movies.  And they called us in 81 and said there's this movie.  And my dad actually didn't want to participate.  He had another gig.  And I said, no, we've got to do this, and so...  What kind of animals were in that movie?  Well, we trained a whole menagerie of animals, but they ended up cutting in only... 
[03:02:00]  What is there?  A raccoon, a deer is actually in the movie, and a rabbit.  Oh, okay.  Is actually in the final cut.  But we were there for a whole month and saw the whole...  You know, as an impressionable young man, you see all these things happen.  And then saw the movie in theaters, and it was a very transcendent film.  And at that age, I was...  It left an indelible impression and wanted to...  It made Jimmy cry the other day.  No, it didn't.  He was just watching E.T., and he started...  He did.  He got all teary.  Somebody had sprayed, apparently, a lot of times during sex, pepper spray will go off. 
[03:02:30]  You know how it is.  I thought, no, man, yes.  But no, it was...  Yeah, I got a little misty eye.  I had to leave the room.  You know, because he called Dee Wallace.  It was Dee Wallace who starred in that, right?  That's right.  Yeah.  Yeah, she was also in the Wolf movie, which I hated because at the end of it, she looked like Chewbacca.  What was the werewolf movie Dee Wallace was in?  Please, anybody, quickly.  Well, she was in Cujo.  Why is Google hot in my brain?  She was in Cujo.  Is that what you're talking about?  No, Cujo.  No, I saw the German version of that with the Lady of the Dog.  It was different.  No, the...  See, now, right now, he would be able to... 
[03:03:00]  It would know what you were saying.  This is where we go back to Ray.  The computer, and it would access...  Yeah.  You would instantly get the information.  Believe me, if my Google was in my brain right now, it would come back, who gives a shit?  You're boring everyone, Jim.  But no, it was...  The Howling.  The Howling.  There you go.  Yes.  The werewolves were great in The Howling, except for her at the end, she looked like Chewbacca,  and then she had a tear, which really annoyed me.  Oh, really?  But when E.T. called her mom, I just had to leave the room.  I wasn't sad or anything, but my girlfriend was there, and I just...  I had to just go do laundry.  She would have crucified you.  Yeah, she's awful. 
[03:03:30]  Balling like that.  Yeah, she's awful.  A movie.  Very interesting stuff, though, man.  Oh, my God, yeah.  Barry Starr with Steven Spielberg.  I love it.  Would he remember you, Spielberg?  I would presume so.  Have you spoken to him or no?  I have not, but he would remember me.  We talked quite a bit, actually.  I was the only other young kid on the show, so...  Oh, okay.  Did you have a shot with Drew Barrymore?  What's that?  Did you have a shot with her?  She's five years old or six years old at the time.  Yeah.  She was even too young for me.  How old were you at the time?  Twelve.  I was twelve.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You're starting to grow a little hair down there. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A little creepy for everybody.  My God, we've just been having this scientific conversation here.  I want to read these health books by Ray.  I really do, because I want to start taking more...  Do you want to care of yourself after the crumb cake or before?  I didn't have crumb cake.  I know.  Not today.  I've been trying to lose weight and things like that.  Ralph.  Why do you have to go with the small font in the book?  Smart people always do.  Because it's a lot of information.  I know, but it just scares me.  What do you want?  The letters are small.  Three feet wide, tall.  Is this maybe a book on tape? 
[03:04:30]  I tell people just to read, just get through chapter one, and even that will change their  life.  I mean, just get through the first few chapters and see what happens.  In which book?  In Singularity is Near.  That, by the way...  It's not jokes for the John.  Exactly.  What are you doing?  I read a little.  That book, by the way, that you're reading, I think, is the single most profound book that's  ever been written in human history.  Singularity.  That book, yes.  Singularity is Near.  Absolutely.  Jimmy wrote the single most profane book.  Yes, I did.  Happy Endings.  Happy Endings.  Yeah.  It was probably the polar opposite of your book, right? 
[03:05:00]  Yeah, exactly.  It certainly was.  It sounds like it's consistent.  Yeah.  It was what it sounds like.  Every yin needs a yang.  That's exactly what it is.  One other thing before we wrap up.  We're on Sirius Satellite Radio, Sirius XM, and you had a hand in this whole thing, I'm  hearing?  Or you knew the creator?  Gee, thanks.  I actually have a close relationship with the founder of Sirius Radio, Martine Rothblatt.  Right.  She was a pioneer in telecommunications and founded Sirius, among other things. 
[03:05:30]  She now runs a very successful biotechnology company that I'm on the board of, United Therapeutics.  Oh, how's it looking in the stock?  Good?  Why don't you give me some insider info?  What do you got?  What do you got?  It looks great.  I was going to buy some Pfizer the other day, and I didn't, and it went up like a buck and  a half.  I'm really pissed.  It gives a stock to me.  And then I sold my goddamn, I sold my NVIDIA stock, and it went up like another dollar.  That was the cover marker, wasn't it?  No, no, it wasn't.  I actually bought Sirius stock at 15 cents.  Not that you care about my stock, but it's now $1.78. 
[03:06:00]  I know.  And I have two shares.  You know what happened?  Two whole shares.  Thank you, sir.  I think it was if Barron's came out and said they're looking for a $3 target price on this  company.  That's what I always thought.  Mel and I talked, and he goes, look, it's going to go up.  Shut it.  All right.  Before we wrap up, can we tell people how they can access the movie?  Oh, yeah.  No, no, of course you can.  I mean, you can go to TranscendentMan.com to see the dates, and the film will be available  on iTunes March 1st and on DVD May 24th.  It's very, very good.  Very interesting.  I like the movie, Ray. 
[03:06:30]  How many presidents have you met?  Because there's footage of Ray with, I mean, there's photos with Edward Kennedy, and there's  photos with, I think, Clinton and Obama.  There's a lot of presidents and celebrities.  Reagan and Reagan.  William Shatner.  The first president I met was Johnson.  That's actually when I did this music-composing computer in high school and won a science  contest and got to meet the president.  Johnson wanted to know how you could drop the piano on North Vietnam.  That's all he cared about.  He talked about peace in our time. 
[03:07:00]  Yes, peace in our time.  Was he a nice man?  We're still working on it.  He is a nice man.  He seemed a little sad.  Really?  He got a little kooky after he was in office, right?  Yeah, when he got out, didn't he grow his hair real long and stuff?  That's what I heard.  Yeah, he got a little, being president back then, forget about it.  You think now is crazy.  Right.  Jeez, that must have been nuts.  What about Reagan?  Was he a sincere, kind of nice, all-around guy?  He's a great communicator. 
[03:07:30]  He's great with crowds.  Ray thought he was an ass.  He was a little distant, personally and personally.  Where do you lie politically?  I'm liberal socially.  I'm conservative economically.  That's not going hand-in-hand these days very well, is it?  Well, they both have to do with personal liberty and freedom.  See, I like less government in my life.  Believe it or not, I am a little more liberal socially than people think I am. 
[03:08:00]  Well, you want to be able to get married.  As of right now, it's only Idaho or one other state.  Well, you know how it goes.  But I am fiscally conservative, but I find it very hard to cross boundaries these days.  It's just impossible.  Everyone wants to be one or the other.  It's very hard to meet in the middle somewhere.  We're very polarized.  Yeah.  Well, there actually isn't one political movement that matches my own philosophy. 
[03:08:30]  Libertarian didn't cut it for you?  A little too what there?  He likes the money.  I like to be left out of it, but yeah, get your hands out of my goddamn pockets.  I'm earning my money.  I don't need to be a 55-45 partner with the United States, and I'm on the short end of the stick.  You just insulted him.  He's a multi.  Oh, we should encourage entrepreneurship.  Very good, yes.  And I think tax rates should be low. 
[03:09:00]  I think it's part of keeping government out of people's lives.  Don't you think it keeps people working, too?  And it gives people the opportunity to use their own capital, and other people would be more apt to invest in new ideas and new technologies if you didn't have to worry that the government was taking half your money.  It's terrible.  I mean, raising tax rates doesn't necessarily raise tax revenues to the government.  It's just like a company raises its prices isn't going to necessarily get more sales. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  It just encourages people to avoid taxes altogether.  What do you think about NASA these days, also?  Because I've always been a kid growing up, you know, 70s and watching the moon launches.  Well, the big push now is for privatizing space.  Privatizing.  I think that's a good idea, fundamentally.  I think it sets us back, though, in order to then build up, because I don't think privatized we're going to be able to get the amount of hardware up there that we have in. 
[03:10:00]  Oh, you'd be surprised, yeah.  Really?  Actually, I just visited SpaceX just two weeks ago, and we're making huge strides in private spaces for, you know, a tenth of the price, for example, per payload.  And it's happening right now.  It seems to be more for profit than exploration, though.  But that's not a bad thing.  I mean, once we can create profit in space, I think you'll see a lot more companies going in that direction.  Richard Branson is doing what they were not able to do, which is just, you know, us going up into space. 
[03:10:30]  The government would have done that.  But would you have been for –  I support government projects where they're really – the investment is too long-term for the private sector, like the Internet.  It was created by the Department of Defense, their research agency, as just a kind of a long-term research project in the 80s.  And that's not something that private enterprise would have done.  Well, look at the whole GPS system also.  Exactly.  It's military in nature. 
[03:11:00]  When it was first made, we never thought – I don't even think the military thought that it was ever going to be used by private citizens on a daily basis.  But there it is.  And where do you think GPS is going to go in the near future?  I hear there's all sorts of plans for it.  I don't know.  Put in the direction.  Yeah, let's put it in.  Put in a destination, O.B.  What do you think that technology turns into?  Because right now it's just giving us directions to our long-lost dance house or something.  Well, it's going to get a higher resolution. 
[03:11:30]  It's going to be integrated into these intelligent navigation systems that will drive your car for you.  Navigation systems are already considering now real-time traffic patterns.  It's going to get more intelligent and more precise.  Do you have any civil liberty worries about this type of thing, putting computer chips or whatever you'd call it in you and GPS tracking this? 
[03:12:00]  Do you have any problem with that morally, yourself, personally?  Well, privacy is a big issue, but actually the technologies of privacy are outpacing the technologies of invading privacy.  I mean you can use encryption and people do use personal encryption.  Well, believe me, I do.  You need to just give you a look.  That's staying ahead of decryption, which is technology of breaking privacy.  So it's a complicated discussion, but I mean it used to be you could just close the blinds in your bedroom to keep your privacy. 
[03:12:30]  Now we have a thousand virtual windows on our lives.  Yeah.  So it gets more complicated, but I think it's still manageable.  It's amazing that you are on camera, especially in a place like New York City.  You're constantly on camera.  I don't think there's anywhere where you're walking.  They say you're on camera way more than you're not.  Some people like that.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, it's true.  If something does happen, you would.  People fear the government looking at us.  It's like a one-way street right now, but we're starting to peer the other way.  So it's when transparency goes both ways, when you have things like WikiLeaks that open up our government, Google actually is showing what the government is censoring, even in the U.S., for example. 
[03:13:00]  So as we start to be able to peer both ways, I think people will change their perceptions about what privacy is.  What are they censoring in the U.S.?  Not to interrupt you, but.  I don't know – I know that there's even movements to censor certain books.  Mark Twain's book was recently – they tried to censor it.  But Google does keep a running list of exactly what the U.S. government is currently censoring, and they publish it all the time.  So it's another democratization of this technology. 
[03:13:30]  But you're right.  WikiLeaks does – and that – I mean there's been a few things I kind of wish they didn't release, just names of people who might be killed.  But overall, they really released anything that was terribly detrimental.  It's really embarrassing.  That's, I think, really the primary reason that the government got upset.  It's more embarrassing than anything else.  You can't put that genie back in the bottle, by the way.  There's so much material out there that it's kind of a delayed effect.  I mean Tunisia was a delayed effect of WikiLeaks.  Why is that?  And now – well, because it showed the corruption of the leaders. 
[03:14:00]  Oh, okay.  And then Rebels was organized on Facebook, and then that idea inspired a couple of 25-year-olds to start the Egyptian revolution.  Yeah, it really is amazing.  Well, I didn't realize that Tunisia was a lot of corruption leaked.  I didn't know that.  Yeah, people find out that their government is a little, you know, like we all do.  What do you think he's holding in that 256-bit encryption download that he's allowed everybody to take a hold of?  Oh, he's going to dole out the key.  He's got the doomsday key there just in case. 
[03:14:30]  All right.  You guys saw the 60 Minutes the other day on –  I did, yeah.  Yeah, it was quite fascinating.  What was it about?  It sure was.  Assange?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What did it say?  I hope you didn't see it.  I saw it.  I really did.  Well, I think it just revealed him as a very moderate individual, a very intelligent, sophisticated person.  Way smarter than I thought.  Yes, very smart.  Yeah.  Not just a Budinsky?  Nah, there was highly intelligent.  I wonder what's in that stupid file, though.  Watch it be really nothing big, like dirty cartoons.  It's, yeah, somebody drawing with Mac paint or Windows and paint. 
[03:15:00]  Ray's got to get the hell out of here.  Yes.  We just got the hook.  All right.  My God.  Ray Kurzweil.  Talked to him for frigging hours.  Transcendent Man is the name of the documentary.  Once again, Barry, who's the director, how do we see this, Dan?  You can go to TranscendentMan.com, and it'll show the dates that the film's playing.  There's information on how the film, you can watch the film on iTunes.  It'll be available on other portals, like Netflix and DVD on May 24th, and it'll be touring the country.  But you can go to TranscendentMan.com for more information. 
[03:15:30]  Okay.  Very good.  And, Ray, thank you, man.  Yes.  I hope you enjoy this.  It's not like the other interviews you do, I'm sure, but, you know.  Well, you know, we like to have a little fun.  Invite me back.  All right.  We'll have Ray back.  We have Ray back.  We have chicks in the studio.  Oh, my God.  We don't even think we're a bunch of boars.  Next, you know, next great invention, come on in and plug it.  Yeah.  We'll do.  We'll do.  At least give us a stock tip.  No, don't say a word. 
[03:16:00]  Give us something.  The S-C-E-C is not going to get on my ass.  Just write down three letters right now.  Just three letters.  Exactly.  Ray Gekko.  Exactly.  All right, man.  Thank you.  We're going to start our weekend.  You got something, Jimmy?  Just a quick plug.  February 11th, Club Madrid in Vegas.  And let me just plug the Wellmont Theater, Montclair, March 5th, and Wilbur Theater in Boston, March 18th.  Ray's going to be there?  Yes, and Ray will also be working with me.  I think there's a very filthy 25 minutes in front of me. 
[03:16:30]  Thursday through Saturday, March 10 through 12, San Francisco, Cobbs Comedy Club.  Very good.  I think Ray's trying not to laugh because he's got a reputation, but it comes out a little bit.  Ray's been sitting here kind of chuckling going, yeah.  He's not going to tell us about it.  Ah, you lower life forms are funny for me to look at.  He's laughing at us the way we laugh when a cat has like a sock on its face.  Exactly.  The Opie and Anthony Show on the Filers. 
[03:17:00]  Sirius XM.  I'm here.  I'll be right with you, people.  It'll be AOL.com.  That's what Anthony's talking about.  To my good friends out there in the listening audience.  Let me just pull my chair up.  My wheel got stuck on a cracker.  It worked like an airplane chalk under the landing gear.  Oh, here I am.  Hi.  There we go.  Hey.

[03:18:30]  Who knew?  Now you do.  AOL.com.  Can I just jump in for a second?  Yes, of course.  That was a terrific hour right there.  That really was.  But there was something going on behind the scenes, and me and Jimmy could not look at each other.  Oh, Jesus.  We were talking about it.  What did I miss?  We were talking about it Monday.  I'd rather do it Monday.  You've got to do it Monday, though, after the mics go off.  Oh, yeah.  I thought I'd just not.  Oh, oh, oh. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, no.  Believe me.  I know.  I know.  Out of respect, I've never held back a laugh.  Dude, dude.  It was the hardest thing not to do.  I do have to say, though, I mean, I would like to read those Chinese brogs, but that fucking stupid, they needed the money.  That just made me laugh.  Don't be nice impression.  While this genius is discussing nanotechnology.  And he's wondering why you're chuckling under your breath.  Dude, I couldn't stop.  I was literally five seconds away from the entire interview being ruined, and then the phone calls were to come in from the other room. 
[03:19:30]  Is there a way to make girls stay young?  Believe me.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Believe me, Uncle Paul wanted to call him desperately.  That was a lot of fun.  But Ray was, I mean, I don't know if people liked him or not, but I thought he was very good.  No, I thought that is some interesting stuff.  If you don't like that, I don't care.  No, his delivery is a bit monotone.  But his info was pretty fascinating.  Here's my take on it.  And the other guy saying Steven Spielberg.  Oh, I know.  That would be one for the ages. 
[03:20:00]  One for the ages.  And singularity.  Oh, God.  Here's my take on it.  The guy isn't going to be a member of the Opie and Anthony and Jimmy show here every day talking, you know, his delivery.  Yeah, a little monotone, a little slow.  But that is some interesting fucking shit.  I like it.  I enjoy listening to it.  And he did smell good, though, and was very healthy looking.  He really was a very healthy looking guy.  Yeah, he really was.  He takes all those pills, huh?  Yeah, he had open heart surgery.  He had a major heart procedure. 
[03:20:30]  He wouldn't tell us what the pills were, though.  No, he sells that.  You could probably buy it.  There's so many of them.  I got the impression he doesn't believe in vitamins, either.  A lot of doctors don't believe in a whole vitamin.  Because he said it's not vitamins.  He's taking some kind of.  Yeah, he's taking other shit.  What is he taking?  Holistic herbs and spices?  Probably weird stuff.  Does he take frankincense?  Like two Jeep truck tires a day.  Just weird stuff that makes you healthy.  That's hard to get down.  I remember Klinger tried to eat a Jeep.  Yes, I remember that episode.  In that awful episode, he got a few lug nuts down and got sick.  Yes, Zale didn't like that very much. 
[03:21:00]  He was in charge of the motor pool, remember?  Yes, he was.  Yes.  Then he opened up a jewelry store that sells shit.  Well, at least he wasn't Zale.  Yes, that's Zale.  I know you, you murderer.  You ain't my Jeep.  You have another library dance.  Cuts his nose off.  We got a lot of them, right?  Why don't you just do them?  Bang them out.  A big take.  Let's bang them out.  Let's bang them out so we get the fuck out of here.  Was there a problem with that?  I just want to know, actually, because I have no clue why.  No, I just need to... 
[03:21:30]  A bed.  Editable.  Right?  Oh, it's got to be editable.  Okay.  Oh, Zale, shut up.  Zale, shut up.  All right.  Vermont Teddy Bear in three, two, one.  Hey, you know, Valentine's Day is right around the corner.  Show some originality.  Sorry.  That was great.  We have to restart that, Eric.  I apologize.  Hey, you know, Valentine's Day is right around the corner.  Show some originality.  Send a handmaid Vermont Teddy Bear. 
[03:22:00]  Picture this, if you will.  Your Bear Graham arrives at...  Your Bear Graham?  Oh, and her old lady Graham pussy is sticking out.  Boo, Jim.  Oh, I love my Bear Graham.  Come for me, Nana.  No, it's not.  It's not Grandma being Bear.  Oh.  No, no.  And wow, are we going to hear it from the Vermont...  Why?  I thought this was a prerecord.  We're live?  Oh, yeah.  Oops-a-daisy. 
[03:22:30]  You really thought we were taping this?  Yes, I would never do that to a live read.  I thought you said you had to time it out.  No, it's a live read.  Oh, I apologize.  I never...  I never fucked my grandmother.  I'm sorry.  I never fucked her.  I gave her a good...  A good...  Yeah.  Holy shit, my stomach hurts.  Sorry about that.  Oh, my God.  I really just thought you were taping.  Oh, that's good. 
[03:23:00]  No, that's fine.  Let me get it out of my system.  Okay.  Ah!  Pussy's old!  Ah!  All right, I'll see you guys.  Jimmy, take it easy, and I'll see you tomorrow.  Jimmy Norton, everybody.  Oh, is he fantastic.  Ha, ha, ha, ha! </pre>
