<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast from La Barbat on West 57th Street was a raucous St. Patrick's Day affair, fueled by copious amounts of alcohol both amongst the hosts and the audience.  The show opened with highly suggestive and sexually explicit conversations, including graphic descriptions of a small penis and a competition to induce female audience members to flash their breasts on stage. This resulted in several women, including a woman named Jennifer with 36DD breasts, exposing their breasts for the broadcast. Jennifer was subsequently invited back to the studio.  A man named Diesel was mentioned in connection with having sex with a midget.

A "Show Us Your Scar" segment followed, featuring audience members displaying various scars; one man, Gary, notably revealed his single testicle to several women after explaining its loss due to testicular torsion. George Killian, representing Killian's Red beer, made a guest appearance and offered a toast. Yoshi, a visibly inebriated bicyclist, also appeared, sharing his intoxicated St. Patrick's Day experiences and comedic observations.  An attempted "quad flash," featuring four sisters simultaneously exposing their breasts, was unsuccessful due to the timely arrival of their mother.  The mother was then given drinks by an audience member.

Throughout the broadcast, the hosts promoted other simultaneous Opie and Anthony broadcast locations.  Numerous photos and videos were taken for the show's website. The show concluded with the hosts and a significant portion of the audience remaining heavily intoxicated.

[00:00:00]  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNAW, Finley's the Jailbreak.  Alright, yeah.  Little Mason, okay.  Nice crowd today.  And this is our first break?  Yeah.  I can't wait till later.  Wow.  We are broadcasting live, LeBarbat, West 57th, between 8th and 9th.  You guys having fun or what, huh?  I guess I gotta start by asking, is anyone sober in this place? 
[00:00:30]  How did you think so?  People got an early start today.  Did anyone go to work today?  No.  Whoa.  That's ambient background noise.  Don't bother with that.  We just threw out the first curse.  That's good.  What's the laser pointer on the table?  Yeah, who's got the laser pointer?  I'm looking around like, what is this?  Who's got the laser pointer?  Who's got the laser pointer?  No, no one ever has them.  Yeah, no one's going to fess up to it.  It's just the dot on the table.  Okay, just, I don't mind.  You put it on my head. 
[00:01:00]  I'll go, oh, look, I'm the Indian gun.  Just don't burn my retinas out, okay?  I need my eyes for half-life.  And it could be an actual gun.  We got a bunch of cops in the back over there.  Yeah, there they are.  And we got the firefighters.  Where are the firefighters?  There they are!  Yeah!  Yeah!  All right, we're still...  And my buddy's up at the bar.  There's Diesel.  Yeah, love nut.  Hey, Diesel had sex with a midget.  He was telling me...  I love this.  I just met... 
[00:01:30]  You can tell how much people have been drinking all day  by the conversations you get in  within the first ten seconds of meeting someone.  I meet him, like ten seconds later,  I had sex with a midget.  He's like, well, tell me all about it.  Well, tell him why he had sex with a midget, though.  Because he admitted to us that he has a real tiny schlong.  Yeah.  So it looks bigger next to a midget.  That's what he said.  Little Vienna sausage fingers, you know?  Those little midget fingers.  So, lady, the guy standing up at the...  Ladies, the guy standing up at the bar,  he's got a real small one, 
[00:02:00]  just in case you're wondering, all right?  He's going to put a Corona bottle across your head.  Yeah, that's all right, though.  We're partying with Killians,  and we're all over the ball field today.  We're at La Barbeck, West 57th,  between 8th and 9th.  Matt Devote is at No Idea.  Great name for a bar.  No Idea, that's on East 20th Street,  30 East 20th Street,  between Park and Broadway.  Ralph Dutour is at Hooters,  starting at 5 o'clock,  Hempstead Turnpike in East Meadow, Long Island.  Eddie Trunk is at Murphy's Townhouse,  starting at 5, 
[00:02:30]  97 Franklin Street in Stamford, Connecticut.  And it's all brought to you by Killian's Red,  the official beer of St. Patrick's Day.  But we are here at La Barbeck.  And we are going to try today,  today,  during our broadcast here,  between 3 and 7,  at La Barbeck,  for the guys,  we are going to try  to get a boob  up on stage.  It'll happen.  We've seen some drunkenness already. 
[00:03:00]  So I think it could happen.  I think it could happen very soon, Anthony.  Also, we've got a lot to give away  if you're on your way over here.  We've got two trips to anywhere in the USA  for two people.  $50 gift certificates  to Chelsea Piers.  We've got movie passes  to Lowe's Cineplex.  And are they still skiing?  We've got ski passes?  Is that happening?  All right.  At Hunter Mountain,  then we've got CDs and T-shirts.  And lots of stupidity on the way.  It's Ovi and Anthony  broadcasting live.  La Barbeck,  West 57th,  between 8th and 9th. 
[00:03:30]  1027 WNEW,  the rock of New York,  George Thorogunit.  It's Ovi and Anthony  broadcasting live.  La Barbeck,  West 57th,  between 8th and 9th.  Man, look at this.  These people are psyched to party.  St. Patrick's Day  in New York City.  Yeah. 
[00:04:00]  And usually,  early on in our show,  it's kind of a mellow crowd,  but these guys are primed already.  No.  All right.  Who's been going  since 8 this morning?  How about 10?  Any late starters?  11?  No.  Yeah, yeah.  Was he?  Not one person.  Hey, you guys,  we've got to say hi  to George Killian.  He's throwing the party today.  The George Killian.  Come on.  Wow.  Hello, everybody.  Look at that voice it has. 
[00:04:30]  I love it.  Hello.  Hello.  I'm delighted to be here  celebrating St. Patrick's Day  with you at WNEW.  Isn't that correct?  Now, George,  how many Killians  have you had today already?  I've lost count.  Did you pour it on  your lucky charms  this morning?  Bring it over here.  So, you're making  the rounds around New York?  Making the rounds,  yeah,  but having a fabulous time.  That's kind of rough  going from bar to bar, 
[00:05:00]  just then you have to...  Hard work.  Oh, yeah.  Someone has to do it.  Yes.  I wish I had your job.  I thought I had an easy job.  I think you have  the best job in New York.  I'd be very sharp.  Maybe you'll consider...  Oh, really?  Really.  You got somebody in the wings  that's going to take your place there?  A few.  Yeah, like Frank Perdue did.  He put his son in there.  Can you do that?  George is soft.  Hey, who isn't? 
[00:05:30]  Now, George,  could you give us  like an Irish toast  or something, maybe?  To get the party started right?  Up the rock!  I'd love to give a...  Give a beer started.  I'd love to give a toast  to the owner of St. Patrick  in St. Patrick's Day.  Okay.  All right?  Yeah, let's do it.  St. Patrick was a gentleman.  Who, through strategy and stealth,  drove all the snakes from Ireland.  Here's a toastie to his health.  But not too many toastings.  Lest you lose yourself in them.  Forget the good St. Patrick  and see all those snakes again. 
[00:06:00]  All right!  Two billion, everyone!  Hey, I have another one.  There once was a man from Nantucket.  George, you know any limericks?  Probably none you could tell on the air, right?  I couldn't put on the air.  No, none on the air?  None on the air.  Okay.  Yeah, they usually rhyme with rock.  You know, things like that.  Luck.  We understand.  All right.  Now, George, you going to be doing some cake stands with us a little later?

[00:07:00]  Before the broadcast is through, we're going to give two trips away to anywhere in the  USA for two people.  That's good if you're on the lam.  Yeah.  You know?  Well, you've got to do something really, really good for a trip.  Come on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Have we gotten nudity yet, Anthony?  No, we're still waiting for that.  Nudity?  We're still waiting.  Oh, really?  Nudity?  Whoa!  Hello!  Could you come on stage and show everyone that?  Oh, the guys would love it.  Yeah, come on up.  Come on.  This is the cornerstone of our show.

Parting with us, Anthony.  We've got New York's finest, New York's bravest, and New York's drunkest.  Well, we were going to play a bit that came in late yesterday, but I guess we can wait.  Who's through that?  I mean, look at what we got.  Yeah, we can't top that, so.  If you want to party with us, it's... 
[00:11:30]  Hi to my friend, Sean, who I know is listening right now.  Say hi to your friend, what?  Sean.  Sean, you just did.  All right.  For one more piece, you can say hi.  We'll fart around and mention for a boo.  All right.  One more piece.  One more piece.  All right.  How about a couple?  Both of you, give the guys a little...  There they go.  Guys, you're going to get all four.  You guys, you missed it all the fun.  If you're in the areas, they're barbed out with Opie and Anthony.  West 57th, between 8th and 9th. 
[00:12:00]  It's 1027-WNEW, the Rock of New York.  1027-WNEW, the Rock of New York.  It's Opie and Anthony, Jeff Leppard, Photographs.  We're broadcasting live, LeBarbat, West 57th, between 8th and 9th.  I don't know how we're going to outdo ourselves from the last break, Anthony.  That's okay.  We'll just have to get more people up here.  Yeah, I think so.  I think we can do that.  I think as the afternoon goes on, I think we'll get more girls that might want to come up here 
[00:12:30]  and give a little St. Paddy's Day spirit.  Any other ladies want to flash?  How about someone on the rally?  Oh, she's waving.  The high-altitude flash.  The high-altitude New Orleans flash.  Yeah, we turn this into Mardi Gras.  Come on, Mardi Gras.  Guys, throw money.  Throw something.  Beans.  All right, we're going to be here until at least 7.  Look at the spotlight goes on.  Yeah, that's smart.  Who's working the spotlight? 
[00:13:00]  That's good.  No?  All right, move the spotlight around.  Maybe we'll find another lady up on the rally.  There he goes.  You've got to be careful.  Oh, I saw some guy get some abuse, man.  What do you mean?  Yeah.  A guy right over here.  A girl was requesting a song.  She came up to me and said she wanted to hear George Thorogood.  And he said, how about you hear my big beep go into your beep?  She turns around, takes her beer, and throws it right on his groin. 
[00:13:30]  So he's got to go around the rest of the night looking like he wet his pants.  Now, where is that guy?  It's a perfect move for a girl.  Where is that guy?  Come on up on stage and show everyone your, uh, the wet spot.  Where's the wet spot?  We've got to see the wet spot.  Yeah, I think the wet spot left.  Oh, it's one of the...  He's changing his pants.  There it is.  All right.  Very good.  That isn't even a guy.  What, did it happen to you two?  How many guys has this happened to? 
[00:14:00]  What, are you kidding?  What are you...  I wouldn't let that happen to me.  Pour him on that.  All right.  This guy's going to pour a beer into your pants.  Is that all right?  All right.  Pulling his head down to his lap.  I don't know what's going on.  We didn't need to see that.  Why are men in their hoses?  Hey, Anthony, late in the show yesterday, we had that schmuck call us.  Oh, yeah.  He said we talk too much on our radio show, and he wanted to talk to our boss who's in the corner over here, Gary.  And we played the runaround game with him. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, no.  Trouble has arrived.  What's up, bro?  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  Days of the new.  Hoping Anthony broadcasts live.  LeBarbat.  West 57th between 8th and 9th.  I got to point this guy out.  Raise your hands, dude.  I don't know if you guys remember when we were smashing the hell out of that Bronco in Menachie, New Jersey.  This guy was putting his bare fist through the windshield and the side window.  Thank you, RPR.  Anthony, I thought you would recognize me for this. 
[00:15:00]  I recognize you.  I gave you a shirt.  A close, light shirt.  I just grabbed the shirt.  Get the guy.  Give him an AEW shirt.  I don't want him to wrap my head.  Look at him.  Ben, you got to take care of that guy.  He's scary.  He's giving him another one.  The same shirt.  Earl, he's going to kick your ass.  You know this guy?  I'm kicking your butt ass.  He rolled over the Bronco single-handedly.  I still got the stitches to prove it.  He does. 
[00:15:30]  He was bleeding like a mother.  And he's like, hey, man, I want to just shake your hands.  I'm like, no, we're not going to shake your hands.  You're a biohazard.  What's your name again, dude?  I remember the face.  Matt.  All right, Matt.  Matt.  All right.  Matt's in the house, everyone.  Look out.  Yeah!  All right, we got to thank Killian's Red for throwing the party today.  If you can't make it to La Barbat, West 57th, between 8th and 9th, we're all over the  ball field today.  Matt Devote, starting at 5 o'clock, will be at No Idea.  That's the name of a bar.  That's pretty cool, right?  Yeah, I heard the spot.  Matt's like, I'll be at No Idea. 
[00:16:00]  Sounds like me on a Saturday night, having no freaking idea.  That's on 30 East 20th Street between Park and Broadway in Manhattan.  Our buddy, our pal, Ralph Titor, he's at Hooters.  Man, he got the luckiest assignment today, huh?  Yeah, but, you know, Ralph can never talk about Hooters, so he's in his own helm right  now.  That's true.  And that's on Hempstead Turnpike in East Meadow, Long Island.  Go see Ralph between 5 and 7.  And Eddie Trunk, who's doing that great show on Saturday night.  Anyone else hear that show on Saturday night? 
[00:16:30]  Saturday Night Rocks!  Saturday Night Rocks, the name of the show.  Well, Eddie's at Murphy's Townhouse at 5, 97 Franklin Street in Stamford, Connecticut.  Eddie, always happy to be out of the studio.  Yes, he's very happy to be doing his own thing today.  And this is all brought to you by Killian's Red, the official beer of St. Patrick's Day.  Now, earlier, if you were listening to the radio, we had the lovely Jennifer.  And who was the other girl?  What was her name?  Who cares?  They both had great foods and they showed everyone on stage.  Jennifer is just beautiful. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  She came up and showed everybody her goods.  Her 36 double Ds.  Just beautiful.  We might have to get an encore presentation later on.  All natural.  All natural, right?  Firm.  Still perky.  Like, for something so big to be so perky.  What can I say?  They're all yours?  Yeah.  Jennifer, I'm going to suggest this.  You should come in the studio to challenge Tara as the hottest girl ever to be naked on the opening show.  Yeah.  I'm totally serious.  I am totally serious. 
[00:17:30]  We got a couple of girls coming down Friday to do that, to take on Tara.  So if you want to join us, we'll let you know off mic.  She's coming down, man.  Off.  All right.  We got something for the ladies here.  So, guys, let the ladies up front for this one because I don't think you guys want to see this.  Let's hear it for Gary, everyone.  Gary, grab that mic.  Yeah, Gary.  Now, Gary, what's your sad story?  What is your story?  Well, I'll give you one of my sad stories.  When I was 16, December 18th, I had broken my name. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  So I had an Operation Christmas Eve.  Okay.  Being a macho guy, I stopped using my crutches too early.  As I was walking with my knee brace and everything, my testicle twisted inside my body.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  And I thought it was just a really bad case of blue balls.  I didn't know what was going on.  Oh, my God.  So I just put it off.  Then when I finally went to the hospital, they told me they would have to have, give me an, I would have to have an operation.  They would see if they could untwist it. 
[00:18:30]  If they couldn't, they'd have to remove it.  So four hours later, I wake up with only one testicle.  Wow.  Wait, so it's like when you take the party balloons and twist them?  Yeah.  And that's what happened?  And it died inside me.  And if I got in the hospital like five hours earlier, they would have been able to say that.  Oh.  Hey, you guys want to see Gary's one testicle?  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I think he's got something to say about this.  I never agreed to show it.  I just got, I had.  Oh, come on.  I had 200 drunk people. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  You are what you eat, buddy, so back on.  Excuse me while I whip this out.  Oh, wait, maybe we could do this.  If a girl wants to see it in private.  Oh, yeah.  Any woman's welcome.  And then she can describe it.  Any woman is welcome to see it firsthand, one mouth, and whatever other buddy parts come into play.  Is there a girl that wants to see, uh, any girls want to see one testicle?  Raise your hand and come toward the stage.  Any of the girls want to, uh, see, this is the difference between girls and guys.  No, they're coming.  They're coming forward.  There's a couple of girls.  I just see guys.  Any other ladies want to see one testicle? 
[00:19:30]  Look, you'll be a, you'll be a, uh, investigative reporter, a correspondent for the Opie and Anthony show.  Is there any other girls that want to see the one testicle?  Because then they can describe it for everyone else.  You look, you come back, you talk on the air, and tell us what it looked like.  Right?  Yeah.  We'll do it that way, right?  All right.  All right.  She's going to, she's going to look.  You're pretty good.  Yeah, wow.  What's your name?  Are you, uh, One Testicle Ted?  One Testicle Gary.  I'm right.  What's your name?  Elaine.  Elaine, you want to see who's going to be?  How long have you been drinking? 
[00:20:00]  I only have one.  That's it, one.  And Gary only has one.  Oh, do you want to see who's going to be drinking or not?  I want to see who's going to be drinking or not.  I want to see who's going to be drinking.  All right.  You want to see who's going to be drinking or not?  You want to look, too?  Yes, I want to see who's going to be drinking or not.  Okay.  All right.  How are we going to do it?  Anyone else want to see Gary's testicle?  Any of the other girls?  There's going to be a group shot.  Should we charge admission?  What's going on?  Can I take advantage of this?  No.  We'll take care of it.  All right, Gary, stand up and show these girls your testicle.  Right here?  Yeah.  No, no, no.  I can't go behind a turn or something. 
[00:20:30]  Sneak back over here.  Why girl will hide your ugly ass from the crowd?  Don't...  Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary.  What am I getting out of this?  We'll take care of you, trust me.  I will give you a little pride.  We'll give you some good stuff.  Come on, the girls are waiting.  Gary, come on.  All right.  Gary just has the girls in the crowd.  The girls are in front of Gary, on their knees, Anthony.  Back up a little, Elaine's saying. 
[00:21:00]  Boy, I bet Rick wishes he was here.  All right, Gary has undone his belts.  He's pulling down his pants.  Whoa.  Whoa, yeah, look at that.  It's true.  There you go.  What am I doing?  What, she's got a problem?  You got a problem?  He just showed the one nut to the girl.  It looks like two fat ones that just came together.  It looks like two fat ones that came together.  That was one testicle.  That was one testicle. 
[00:21:30]  What do you think of the one testicle?  I think it looked like a potato.  It looked like two nuts or one.  It just looked like one, two, a potato, right?  Hey, did you notice that the one testicle got bigger after they removed the, because I looked, and it was very large.  It's been eight years, so it's probably just come through.  Maybe the one testicle became super testicle.  Yes, nature.  I don't have a partner.  Now I must become super testicle.  He'll be doing a special on NOVA next week. 
[00:22:00]  You don't know.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, let's hear it for Gary and his one testicle, everyone.  A tragic story.  Five hours earlier, you would have kept your nut.  I would have saved it, and I would have been fine.  Did you keep it in a jar or something?  I don't know, but the doctor kind of had a little freaky look, so.  Really?  It could be sitting in the back of some roof somewhere.  I don't know.  Well, good luck to you.  Can you still perform and everything?  Oh, yeah.  It's one testicle.  Yes.  So it's no big deal, right?  I know.  It's just a shock when it first appears.  Well, that's the human body. 
[00:22:30]  It's the penis.  I haven't seen so many times ago.  Look at you.  Hey, honey, you want to see penis?  I think you'll have some takers out here.  All the guys are starting to pull down their pants for a while.  All right.  We've got lots more to come.  So if you're going to head to the Broadcasting Live, you still have time to get down here.  We'll be here until at least 7 o'clock.  Peace out.  It's LeBarbat, West 57th.  All right.  We're back.  That's Collective Soul and Heavy on the Rock of New York, 102.7 WNW. 
[00:23:00]  It's LeBarbat, West 57th, between 8th and 9th.  Just having an overall piss-up.  Yeah, good time.  We've got more girls coming up on stage to show some boogs or what?  Well, some guy just informed me there were four girls over there on the side of the stage.  One who come on up and show.  We'll do that as a little tease just in case people are on their way over here.  Sure.  Something to look forward to if you're on the road.  But right now we want to do the first round of the Show Us Your Scar competition, Anthony.  Okay.  This is based on audience applause of these scars, too, Opie. 
[00:23:30]  Yes, and we're going to need the guy with the spotlight to help us out.  Who do we got first there, Ben?  Do you want to do John first?  All right.  Let's do John first.  John has an ass scar.  John, sit on the seat and talk to us for a few minutes.  And if you're in your car going, man, I wish I could see this, don't worry.  Black Earl has got the digital camera.  We're taking pictures, and hopefully they'll be on the website by tomorrow afternoon.  Now, John, you've got an ass scar.  Yes, right on my tailbone.  Like that crack of the ass part.  Now, how did this happen?  I had a benign tumor that had to get removed. 
[00:24:00]  Okay.  And you have no problem showing everyone your ass?  No, no problem.  I've had the scar for 15 years.  All right.  15 years.  I've got another one on the middle of my back, too, another little removal.  All right.  You guys want to see John's ass?  Well, you're going to end that.  You've got to get something out of this.  But just like a car accident, you're going to look anyway.  Exactly.  All right, John, if you would stand up.  We've got the spotlight on the stage.  Look at the girl that wanted to see the testicles.  She's, like, yelling.  All right.  All right. 
[00:24:30]  Ben's got the camera.  He's taking a picture.  There's John.  And he's got another tumor scar on the back there.  Very nice, John.  Wow.  What do you guys think of John's ass scar?  Wait.  Wow.  We're not talking about his ass.  We're talking about his ass scar.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Who's next?  Jane.  Wow.  We're going to talk to Jane here.  Come on, Jane.  Grab a mic.  All right, Jane.  Hello.  How are you doing? 
[00:25:00]  How are you?  Very well.  Man, you are hammered.  Yeah.  No, I'm not.  No?  You sure?  No.  All right.  Now, Jane, you've got a...  She's smacking a...  You have a fag over here.  You have a gallbladder scar.  Right here.  Okay.  Let me...  Wow.  That's pretty good.  Oh, that's pretty good surgery.  All right.  Turn around and show the crowd.  This is Jane and her gallbladder scar.  Jane, show us!  That's pretty good.  I think we can do better, but that's pretty good.  That's good.  Huh?  I was dead.  Wait.  You have to talk to the mic here. 
[00:25:30]  Okay.  This scar?  Yeah?  Yeah.  I was dead.  They rejuvenated me.  I was given my last rites for five times in 30 days.  Really?  This scar to me is very important.  I am rejuvenated and alive again.  Did you see the light now?  I did.  I saw the light.  Did you see, like, your relatives?  I was floating above myself, and I saw myself.  Right on.  My sisters are right there, and they'll call you that.  Near-death experience, man.  Oh.  All right.  You guys.  You guys.  Let's hear it for Jane.  She was dead.  She was dead. 
[00:26:00]  Oh.  She just flashed.  She just gave him a little extra there, Anthony.  She just flashed the crown.  Errol missed it.  I can tell.  You missed that fixer, didn't you, Errol?  That was pretty quick, though.  Son of a gun.  That was pretty fast.  All right.  Who do we got next, Ben?  All right.  We got Kelly the guy with a pretty outrageous stretch mark.  Stretch marks?  Wait.  Kelly, grab the mic.  Now, Kelly, what's up?  What's happening, guys?  How you doing, man?  It's called four years of college, man.  I spent nothing but drinking and screwing.  Did you used to be a skinny guy or something? 
[00:26:30]  No.  No.  You're always big?  Yeah.  Big bean for size squash.  And then what was the stretch marks from?  Like eating and drinking?  Eating and drinking.  Yeah.  I spent four years of college.  I mean, what the hell?  I don't think stretch marks qualify, though.  I bet you a million dollars they come from that.  All right.  Let me see.  All right.  These guys want tits, and I'll show them tits.  I mean, it's no big deal.  I got no old brother.  All right.  We want to see your stretch marks.  Face the crowd.  Stretch marks?  Wow.  Look at that.  What the hell is that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's proud of him.  That's okay.  Hey, that takes some good work, man.  That's good, Kelly.  That's hard work.  Very good.  Smitty, what's up?  So we got Mark?  All right, Mark, come on up and show us your scar, Mark.  Ready, please?  Sit down.  Grab the mic, Mark.  Now, wow, you got some gnarly knees.  Is that where the scars are?  Whoa.  Wait, talk into the mic.  That goes from my knee to my thigh.  Okay.  And the other side is about four inches across.  Yeah.  And then there's another one.  Over here from a motorcycle accident. 
[00:27:30]  All right, stand on the chair.  Hopefully, you won't break your leg and get more scars.  All right, this is Mark and his knee scars.  Pull up your pants so they can see the whole scar on the left there.  That's pretty good.  That's not bad.  That's not bad.  Now, how'd that happen?  This one, motorcycle.  Oh, motorcycle.  And this one, my leg locked back.  There you go.  My knee.  Oh, your foot went the wrong way.  Yeah.  And hit you in that forehead like?  In the shoulder.  In the shoulder?  Locked back.  Oh, man. 
[00:28:00]  It locked back and came right up.  Snap.  All right, let's hear it for Mark, everyone.  All right.  Not bad.  Not bad.  And we can't find Brad, the shotgun victim.  Where's Brad?  Oh, come on, Brad.  Where's Brad?  All right.  Oh, we want to see the shotgun guy.  Well, we'll take a break.  It's the first round of the Show It's Your Scar competition.  We'll get Brad up here in a little bit.  It's Sophie and Anthony broadcasting live.  LeBarbat, West 57th, between 8th and 9th on the Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.

Okay, listen, if you can't make it to LeBarbat where we're hanging out, we got people all  over the ball field.  We got Matt Devote right now at a bar called No Idea.  I don't want to say it's appropriate, or Matt might be insulted, but that's appropriate.  There you go.  It's 30 East 28th Street between Park and Broadway in Manhattan.  Our buddy, our pal, Ralph DeTora, he's great when he's on our show.  He's at Hooters right now.

[00:33:30]  This crowd is absolutely nuts at this point.  All right, we've got to explain this, Anthony.  We had something incredible set up for you guys here.  We have, oh my God, now the mother's coming on stage.  Okay, let me explain.  Here's the deal.  All right, here's the deal.  When we were in commercials earlier, right?  Yeah, yeah.  We found out that these four sisters want to show their boobs all at the same time on the stage. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And we were all set to do it, and then their mom showed up.  Mom showed up, and they came up and said, no, don't even mention this, that this is going  to happen.  But, I mean, come on.  I think it's a verbal contract or something, right?  All right.  Someone shield the mom's eyes.  She doesn't want to see this.  Maybe mom could.  Wait a minute.  Mom just won a tour of La Barbat.  It's a grand tour. 
[00:34:30]  It's one of the prizes here we're giving away.  It's a tour of La Barbat.  Start with the back corner.  All right, wait, Anthony.  Tom.  One of our faithful listeners have got to take one for the team and take mom to the  bar and do a couple shots with her so she doesn't see the mess that's about to happen  on the stage.  Yeah, yeah.  All right?  All right.  All the sisters, I want you sitting down at this microphone over here.  Look at this.  Are you girls attractive?  Look at this.  Isn't this great?  You guys have gorgeous blue eyes.  Earl, I hope you're taking pictures.  That must have been a great family to have during the high school years. 
[00:35:00]  You girls must have been wild, right?  I can tell.  Very wild.  They are hammered.  Okay, one at a time.  What's your name?  Jane.  Jane, okay.  Nice to meet you.  Andrea.  Andrea.  Jane, Andrea.  Gary.  Her name's Jackie.  Jackie, whatever.  I don't care what your names are.  And Elaine, the mess on my lap.  I think Elaine likes you, Elby.  I can tell.  How can you forget me? 
[00:35:30]  Okay, listen.  I'm the one.  Take it over.  Because I'm ready to fall over here.  Well, we actually, I don't know.  Guys, do you want to see the quad flash?  The quad flash.  Okay.  Do you want to see the quad flash?  I think we do.  All right, girls, get up.  Get up.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's see this.  Let's see this.  This could be a first.  You know how?  You will hear the loudest cheer from the crowd if we even attempt the quad flash. 
[00:36:00]  The quad flash, everyone.  We're talking octoboob here with the quad flash.  No one wants to see Ant and I.  Get them closer to the stage, man.  Yeah, let's go.  All right.  Hey, how long have you girls been at it today?  Huh?  Seven this morning?  Oh, 11.  11.  Okay.  The fireman's lifting up her shirt.  She doesn't even notice.  All right, guys.  You guys kick ass, man.  Do you guys want to see this or what, huh? 
[00:36:30]  The four sisters?  Wow.  Look at this.  My mother's here.  Your mother is drinking.  It's okay.  Trust me.  We took care of your mom.  She's doing a couple shots.  We're going to hook her up with surprises.  Mom's fine.  Actually, you know how I like freak shows.  I would love to see your mom up here doing the same thing with the sisters.  Well, yeah.  Who would?  All right, ladies.  If we can work out the quad flash.  Now, ladies, you've got to lose some, like, clothes.  Loosen up and get ready here for the quad flash.  The quad flash.  Okay, they're pulling the shirts out of their pants, Anthony. 
[00:37:00]  Let's all get ready for the quad flash.  Oh, no.  That's okay.  You know what?  The one with...  What's your name?  The one with the short hair?  Hey, Elmo.  Hey, Ben.  Yeah, Ben, get out of the way.  The guys want to take shots of this, man.  Oh, man.  I don't think...  No, Ben, the one with the short hair.  What's wrong with you?  You guys, I think they...  It's a girl, Ben.  I know you have problems relating to women.  All right, you guys.  I think they need some encouragement or this isn't going to happen.  I think they need some encouragement.  And for the quad flash, Anthony. 
[00:37:30]  Opie, the one with the short hair is the killjoy.  She is saying mom's here and she's all upset.  Yeah, but she's wearing the pants up to her nips and everything.  Yeah, but that one's a dirty girl.  Yeah, I like her.  Yeah, you're a dirty girl, aren't you?  Yeah, you want to flash those boobies, don't you?  Yeah.  All right, no, don't molest the girls, guys.  All right.  What is this?  What is...  All right, come on, guys.  Let's hear some encouragement here.  We need this to happen.  Come on.  Whip them out.  Whip them out. 
[00:38:00]  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  I think they're ready.  They're ready.  They're ready.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Oh, look, they're unbuckling.  Here they go.  They're getting ready.  One, two.  Come on, girls.  Turn around.  Let them rip.  We're wasting valuable time here, girls.  Come on.  Did mom ruin this whole thing?  No, they're going to...  No, no, look.  She's getting ready.  She's ready.  I like you.  She's ready.  All right.  You're a dirty girl.  All right, you girls. 
[00:38:30]  Dad.  Oh.  Look, it's a mess.  All right.  Here.  Oh.  Come on.  Come on.  You know what I feel like, Opie?  I feel like I'm at that party back when you were a kid and you thought you were going  to get some.  And you tried the whole night and really tried hard, but just nothing happened.  Just go home with a bad case of chafing.  Yeah, yeah.  Blue balls.  No, dude, get off the stage. 
[00:39:00]  We don't want to scare the guys.  This is like the dry hump.  This is not working.  Come on, ladies.  Come on, ladies.  Oh, my God.  This is what we get for leaving Ben the fag in charge of the girls.  And, Opie, they're so drunk right now.  I know.  There's no way to organize them.  My mother's here.  We can't do this.  Your mom's busy drinking.  Trust me.  Come on, girls. 
[00:39:30]  Wait, wait.  Your mom knows.  I can't do it.  Your mom knows what you guys are all about.  Oh, the CT.  Well, once again, mom ruined it.  Thanks, mom.  Thanks, mom.  Thanks, mom.  Thanks, mom.  Thank you.  Direct everything.  The CT.  Hey, wait, wait.  Anthony, is there any ladies out there that doesn't have their mom here that can help us out?  Yeah, that could be willing to come up and maybe give a little bit to the crowd here.  I mean, I think we're ready to see Jennifer again. 
[00:40:00]  Jennifer rocks, man.  Ladies, get off the stage.  We'll show you how it's done.  Jennifer, get up here really fast.  Yeah, Jennifer, you kick ass, man.  Oh, my God.  We love Jennifer.  Big CT to those girls.  You know, this is what used to happen.  This is how it's done, guys.  Here's how it's done.  This is Jennifer with her 36 double D.  She's going to be on our show Friday to take on Tara as the hottest girl to ever take her clothes off on the Opie and Anthony show.  Jennifer's got a very nice pair on her here.  We love these. 
[00:40:30]  We love them.  Jennifer, let them fly.  This is how it's done.  Oh, yeah.  She's doing it slow.  Look at this.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Let's hear it for Jennifer, guys.  You see the paparazzi in the front row?  Oh, my God.  Happy St. Paddy's Day to you, Jennifer.  I want to say hi to Dennis and Derek and Martin and Mario.  Woo!  Oh, yeah.  One more time.  One more time.  One more time.  There she goes.  One more time.  Oh, my God. 
[00:41:00]  That was tough.  Are those great?  That is the best, man.  It's like the paparazzi.  I need to see that again, Ann, because there were so many flash bulbs.  Let's see how many flashes go.  Yeah, let's watch the flashes.  That happens a whole time.  Here she goes.  It's like a paparazzi.  I was blinded by the flashes.  Watch this.  Look at all the cameras up front.  Watch this.  Here she goes.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  Look at those selfies.  Are they beautiful?  Thank you.  That's the best breath of my life. 
[00:41:30]  All right.  We've got to take a break.  This is an absolute train wreck.  But what else do you expect?  Oh, we knew this was going to happen.  It's St. Paddy's Day.  Everyone's been drinking a little bit.  Are you funny, Ray?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jennifer will be on the show.  Oh, real fast, because we're doing a lot of visual stuff.  We're taking a lot of pictures for the website.  Now, this is weird.  Scott Columbo's back at the station putting all the clean pictures on the WNEW website.  Boring, boring, boring.  Well, he's doing a good job, but they have to steer themselves clear at the WNEW website 
[00:42:00]  of the pictures that show maybe some nip.  Right.  So, I'll be getting those, and tonight I'll put them on our website, our secret little underground website.  The good thing what Scott is doing is he's giving you a zip file of all the nudity,  and we're going to put it on the semi-live studio cam.  So, punch into our website.  Later on tonight.  You'll see those.  All right.  More to come.  It's Opie and Anthony broadcasting live.  It's LeBarbat, West 57th, between 8th and 9th, with 1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York.  Yeah, The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  That's the band indigenous, and now that you're gone, it's Opie and Anthony broadcasting live.  LeBarbat, West 57th, between 8th and 9th.  You guys having a good time thus far, or what?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cheers to Killian's Red for throwing the party, man.  Oh, oh, well, yeah.  Anthony's out.  I've been asking for a beer for about an hour now.  I guess I've got to go to the bar.  All right, listen, if you can't make...  No, no, that's okay.  No secondhand beer.  I don't want backlash. 
[00:43:00]  This guy's giving you the backlash.  Backlash, dude.  I appreciate the effort.  We'll be right back. </pre>
