<pre> The Rock of New York 1027WAW, Finlay's the jailbreak.  Alright, yeah.  Remember this in our case.  Nice crowd tonight.  Yeah, yeah.  And this is our first break.  I can't wait till later.  Wow.  We are broadcasting live LeBar Bad West 57th between 8th and 9th.  You guys having fun or what?  I guess I gotta start by asking, is anyone sober in this place?  No! 
[00:30]
 People got an early start today.  Did anyone go to work today?  No!  Whoa!  That's ambient background noise.  Don't bother with that.  We just threw out the first curse. That's good.  What's the laser pointer on the table?  I'm looking around like, what is this?  Who's got the laser pointer?  No, no one ever has them.  No one's gonna fess up anyway.  Just the dot on the table.  Okay, I don't mind putting it on my head. 
[01:00]
 I'll go, oh look, I'm the Indian gun.  Just don't burn my retinas out, okay?  I need my eyes for half life.  And it could be an actual gun. We got a bunch of cops in the back over there.  Yeah, there they are.  And we got the firefighters. Where are the firefighters?  There they are!  Yeah!  Alright, we're still in the middle.  And my buddy's up at the bar.  Yeah, lug nut.  Hey, Diesel had sex with a midget.  He was telling me, I love this. 
[01:30]
 You can tell how much people have been drinking all day  by the conversations you get in within the first ten seconds of meeting someone.  I meet him, like ten seconds later,  I had sex with a midget.  He's like, well, tell me all about it.  Well, tell him why he had sex with a midget though.  Because he admitted to us that he has a real tiny schlong.  Yeah, so it looks bigger next to a midget.  That's what he said.  Little Vienna sausage fingers, you know?  Those little midget fingers.  So ladies, the guy standing up at the bar, he's got a real small one, 
[02:00]
 just in case you're wondering, alright?  He's going to put a corona bottle across your head.  Yeah, that's alright.  We're partying with Killian's and we're all over the ball field today.  We're at La Barbe at West 57th between 8th and 9th.  Matt Devotee is at No Idea.  Great name for a bar, No Idea.  That's on East 20th Street, 30 East 20th Street between Park and Broadway.  Ralph the Tour is at Hooters,  starting at 5 o'clock, Hempstead Turnpike in East Meadow, Long Island.  Eddie Trunk is at Murphy's Townhouse starting at 5, 
[02:30]
 97 Franklin Street in Stamford, Connecticut.  And it's all brought to you by Killian's Red, the official beer of St. Patrick's Day.  But we are here at La Barbe.  And we are going to try today during our broadcast here between 3 and 7 at La Barbe.  For the guys, we are going to try to get a boob up on stage.  It'll happen.  We've seen some drunkenness already, so I think it could happen. 
[03:00]
 I think it could happen very soon, Anthony.  Also, we've got a lot to give away if you're on your way over here.  We've got two trips anywhere in the USA for two people,  $50 gift certificates to Chelsea Piers,  we've got movie passes to Lowe's Cineplex.  And are they still skiing? We've got ski passes? Is that happening?  All right. At Hunter Mountain, we've got CDs and T-shirts.  Lots of stupidity on the way.  It's Opie and Anthony broadcasting live. La Barbe at West 57 between 8 and 9.  Man, look at this. 
[03:30]
 These people are psyched to party, St. Patrick's Day in New York City.  Yeah.  And usually early on in our show, it's kind of a mellow crowd, 
[04:00]
 but these guys are primed already.  All right. Who's been going since 8 this morning?  How about 10?  Any late starters? 11?  Yeah, yeah, was he?  Not one person.  Hey, you guys, we've got to say hi to George Killian.  He's throwing the party today.  Zee George Killian.  Come on.  Wow. Hello, everybody. 
[04:30]
 Look at that voice in his head. I love it.  Hello. Hello. I'm delighted to be here celebrating St. Patrick's Day with you at WNEW.  Isn't that great?  Now, George, how many Killians have you had today already?  I've lost count.  Did you pour down your lucky charms this morning?  Bring it over here.  So you're making the rounds around New York?  Making the rounds, yeah, but having a fabulous time.  That's kind of rough going from bar to bar, because then you have to... 
[05:00]
 Hard work.  Someone has to do it.  I wish I had your job.  I thought I had an easy job.  I think you have the best job in New York.  I'd be ready to hire you shortly. Maybe you'll consider it.  Oh, really? You got somebody in the wings that's going to take your place here?  A few.  Like Frank Perdue did? He put his son in there?  He'd do that?  George, show us.  Hey, who is it? 
[05:30]
 Now, George, could you give us like an Irish toast or something maybe?  To get the party started right?  Give him a beer. Give him a beer to start it.  I'd love to get a toast in honor of St. Patrick's Day.  Okay.  Alright? Yeah, let's do it.  St. Patrick was a gentleman who should strategize stealth.  Drove all the snakes from Ireland.  Here's a toastie to his health.  But not too many toastings, lest you lose yourself and them.  Forget the good St. Patrick and see all those snakes again. 
[06:00]
 Alright! Two billion, everyone!  Hey, I have another one.  There once was a man from Nantucket.  George, you know any limericks?  Probably none you could tell on the air, right?  I couldn't put it on the air.  Yeah, they usually rhyme with rock.  You know, things like that.  Luck.  We understand.  Alright, now George, you're going to be doing some cake stands with us a little later? 
[06:30]
 Funnel shots?  Funnel shots.  Okay.  You guys, let's hear it for George Killian, huh?  Lots more to come. It's Opie and Anthony Broadcasting Live.  La Barbat, West 57th, between 8th and 9th.  Alright, plenty of time to get your ass down here.  102.7 W&W, the Rock of New York, Everclear and Santa Monica.  It's Opie and Anthony Broadcasting Live.  La Barbat, West 57th, between 8th and 9th Avenue.  Don't worry, there's plenty more shirts where that came from.  Well, we got lots of stuff to give away. 
[07:00]
 Before the broadcast is through, we're going to give two trips away to anywhere in the USA for two people.  That's good if you're on the lam.  Yeah.  Well, you've got to do something really, really good for a trip. Come on.  Yeah, yeah.  Have we got nudity yet, Anthony?  No, we're still waiting for that.  Nudity?  Still waiting.  Oh, really? Nudity?  Whoa, hello.  Could you come on stage and show everyone that?  Oh, the guys would love it.  Yeah, come on up. Come on.  This is the cornerstone of our show. 
[07:30]

Will she be throwing out the first boob of St. Patty's Day?  Wow, look at the guys. Oh, guys. Guys love this.  It's my turn.  It's your turn?  Yeah, we flashed the police officers during the parade, so it's... 
[08:00]
 Oh, the police officers love boobs.  So it's my turn.  Now, Jennifer, how big are those?  They're 36 double Ds.  There's no other way to put it.  36 double Ds.  You want it? Here, Ben, wait, you have 38 double Ds?  36 double Ds.  Well, would you be willing to share with the crowd?  Oh, she would.  Oh, you have the 38 double Ds?  Well, maybe we could have a boob off.  We could have a boob off.  We can make this up as we go along.  Yeah, give your friend the camera. She wants to get a picture of you.  Yeah. 
[08:30]
 Earl, for the love of God, you better get a picture of this for our website.  If you don't get these...  You mess up these pictures, Earl.  It's over. It's over.  What's your name?  It's over for Earl.  Linda has the 38 double Ds and Jennifer has the...  I like Jennifer's.  Well, you haven't seen...  Look at those. Oh, come on. Look at those, man.  All right, you guys want to see something or what, huh?  All right, should we start with the 36s?  I think we start with the 36s and work our way up, Anthony.  All right, let's go. 36. 
[09:00]
 Oh, my God. Look at that.  It doesn't like green elevators.  I love that.  The crowd seems to not like that because she's showing her bra.  Who's the bra? Who's the bra? Who's the bra? Who's the bra? Who's the bra?  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute. I think I have seen heaven. Wow. 
[09:30]

And people, isn't this what St. Patty's Day is all about?  Where's the 38 double Ds now?  Oh, she's a 38D.  All right, you're a double D, 36 double D, and you're a 36.  Who the hell cares? 
[10:00]
 Whip off your boobs.  No, I really like the whole mathematics. Lose the shirt, honey.  Wow, let me see this.  Wait, wait, we have a rule violation.  We have a rule viola...  God, oh, but your head was in the way.  Can I get a private show, please?  What do you guys think of that, huh? 
[10:30]
 Can I get a private show?  His head was in the way. Can I get a private show?  One more time! One more time! One more time!  I think the 36 double Ds have it.  Wow, ladies, beautiful. Beautiful.  I one shot together.  Look at this guy, one shot together. He's got his camera. 
[11:00]
 He's taking pictures.  He's a firefighter, too, man.  Speaking of which, we've got to say hi to the Yonkers fire department hanging with us today.  Station 4, engine 304, ladder 74, partying with us after this.  We've got New York's finest, New York's gravest, and New York's drunkest.  Well, we were going to play a bit that came in late yesterday, but I guess we can wait.  I mean, look at what we've got.  We can't stop that.  If you want to party with us, it's... 
[11:30]
 Say hi to your friend. What?  Sean.  Sean, you just did.  Alright, for one more peek, you can say hi.  We'll fart around a mission for a boob.  Alright, how about a double?  Both of you guys, give the guys a little...  Guys, you're going to get all four.  Yeah!  You guys, you're missing all the fun.  If you're in the area, it's La Barba with Okie and Anthony.  West 57th between 8th and 9th. 
[12:00]
 It's 1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York.  It's Okie and Anthony, Def Leppard, Photograph.  We're broadcasting live, La Barba, West 57th between 8th and 9th.  I don't know how we're going to outdo ourselves from the last break, Anthony.  That's okay, we'll just have to get more people up here.  Yeah, I think so.  I think we can do that.  I think it's the afternoon goes on. 
[12:30]
 I think we'll get more girls that might want to come up here.  And give a little St. Patty's Day spirit.  Any other ladies want to flash?  How about someone on the railing?  Oh, she's waving.  The high altitude flash.  The high altitude New Orleans flash.  We turn this into Mardi Gras.  Come on, Mardi Gras.  Guys, throw money, throw something.  Please.  All right, we're going to be here until at least 7.  Look at the spotlight goes on.  That's smart.  Who's working the spotlight? 
[13:00]
 That's good.  All right, move the spotlight around.  Maybe we'll find another lady up on the railing.  There he goes.  You got to be careful.  I saw some guy get some abuse, man.  What do you mean?  Yeah.  Guy right over here.  Girl was requesting a song.  She came up to me and said she wanted to hear George Thorogood.  And he said, how about you hear my big beep go into your beep.  She turns around, takes her beer and throws it right on his groin. 
[13:30]
 So he's got to go around the rest of the night looking like he wet his pants.  Now, where is that guy?  It's a perfect move for a girl.  Where is that guy?  Come on up on stage and show everyone your wet spot.  This is the wet spot.  We got to see the wet spot.  I think wet spot left.  It's one of the...  He's changing his pants.  There it is.  All right.  Very good.  That isn't even the guy.  What did it happen to you too?  How many guys does this happen to? 
[14:00]
 What are you kidding?  I wouldn't let that happen to me.  Pour him on that.  All right.  This guy's going to pour a beer into your pants.  Is that all right?  All right.  Pulling his head down.  Yeah, we didn't laugh.  I don't know what's going on.  We didn't need to see that.  Firemen in their hoses.  Hey, Anthony, late in the show yesterday, we had that schmuck call us.  Oh, yeah.  He said we talked too much on our radio show and he wanted to talk to our boss who's in  the corner over here, Gary.  And we played the runaround game with him. 
[14:30]
 Oh, no.  Trouble has arrived.  What's up, bro?  The Rock of New York, 1027WNEW.  Days of the new.  Hope you and Anthony broadcast a live LeBarbat at West 57th between 8th and 9th.  I got to point this guy out.  Raise your hands, dude.  I don't know if you guys remember when we were smashing the hell out of that Bronco in  Monocay, New Jersey.  This guy was putting his bare fist through the windshield and the side window.  Thank you, OPR.  Anthony, I thought you would recognize me for this. 
[15:00]
 I recognize you.  I recognized you, you mother-in-law.  I gave you a shirt.  A cool, light shirt.  I just grabbed the shirt.  Get the guy.  Give him an N.E.W. shirt.  I don't want him to wrap my head.  Look at him.  Ben, you got to take care of that guy.  He's scary.  He's giving him another one, the same shirt.  Earl, he's going to kick your ass.  You know this guy?  He rolled over the Bronco single-handedly.  I still got the stitches to prove it. 
[15:30]
 He does.  He was bleeding like a mother and he's like, hey, man, I want to just shake your hands  and like, no, we're not going to shake your hands.  You're a biohazard.  What's your name again, dude?  I remember the face.  Matt.  All right, Matt.  Matt's in the house, everyone.  Look out.  Yeah!  We got to thank Killian's Red for throwing the party today.  If you can't make it to La Barbat, West 57th, between 8th and 9th, we're all over the ball  field today.  Matt Devote, starting at 5 o'clock, will be at No Idea.  That's the name of the bar.  That's pretty cool, right?  Yeah, I heard the spot.  Matt's like, I'll be at No Idea. 
[16:00]
 Sounds like me on a Saturday night, having no freaking idea.  That's on 30 East 20th Street between Park and Broadway in Manhattan.  Our buddy, our pal Ralph Titor, he's at Hooters.  Man, he got the luckiest sign in today, huh?  Yeah, but you know, Ralph can never talk about Hooters.  That's true.  So he's in his own helm right now.  That's true.  And that's on Hempstead Turnpike in East Meadow, Long Island.  Go see Ralph between 5 and 7.  And Eddie Trunk, who's doing that great show on Saturday nights.  Anyone else hear that show on Saturday night with that? 
[16:30]
 Saturday Night Rocks!  Saturday Night Rocks!  Eddie's at Murphy's Townhouse at 597 Franklin Street in Stanford, Connecticut.  Eddie always happy to be out of the studio.  Yes, he's very happy to be doing his own thing today.  And this is all brought to you by Killian's Red, the official beer of St. Patrick's Day.  Now, earlier if you were listening to the radio, we had the lovely Jennifer.  And who was the other girl? What was her name?  Jennifer!  Who cares? They both had great foods and they showed everyone on stage.  Jennifer is just beautiful. 
[17:00]
 She came up and showed everybody her goods.  Her 36 double V's. Just beautiful.  We might have to get an encore presentation later on.  All natural.  All natural, right?  Firm, still perky. For something so big to be so perky.  What can I say?  They're all yours?  Yeah.  Jennifer, I'm going to suggest this.  You should come in the studio to Challenge Terror, it's the hottest girl ever to be naked on the Open Air 3 show.  I'm totally serious.  I am totally serious. 
[17:30]
 We've got a couple of girls coming down Friday to do that, to take on Terror.  So, if you want to join us, we'll let you know off mic.  She's coming down, man.  Alright.  We've got something for the ladies here.  So, guys, let the ladies up front for this one because I don't think you guys want to see this.  Let's hear it for Gary, everyone.  Gary, grab that mic.  Yeah, Gary.  Now, Gary, what is your sad story?  What is your story?  Well, I'll give you one of my sad stories.  When I was 16, December 18th, I had broken my knee. 
[18:00]
 Yeah.  So, I had an operation Christmas Eve.  Okay.  Being a macho guy, I stopped using my crutches too early.  As I was walking with my knee brace and everything, my testicles twisted inside my body.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  And I thought it was just a really bad case of blue balls or something.  I didn't know what was going on.  Oh, my God.  So, I just put it off.  Then when I finally went to the hospital, they told me they would have to have an operation.  They would see if they could untwist it. 
[18:30]
 If they couldn't, they'd have to remove it.  So, four hours later, I wake up with only one testicle.  Whoa.  Wait, so it's like when you take the party balloons and twist them and that's what happened?  And it died inside me.  And if I got in the hospital like five hours earlier, they would have been able to save it.  You guys want to see Gary's one testicle?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I think Lee's got something to say about this.  I never agreed to show it.  I just got, I had 200 drunk people push down. 
[19:00]
 You are with you, buddy, so back off.  Excuse me while I whip this hat.  Maybe we could do this.  If a girl wants to see it in private.  Oh, yeah.  Any woman is welcome.  And then she can describe it.  Any woman is welcome to see it firsthand, in the mouth and whatever other buddy parts come into play.  Is there a girl that wants to see, any girls want to see one testicle?  Raise your hand and come toward the stage.  Any of the girls want to see this?  The difference with my number.  Oh, no, they're coming.  They're coming forward.  I just see guys.  Any other ladies want to see one testicle? 
[19:30]
 You want to look, you'll be a you'll be a investigative reporter, a correspondent for the Opium Anthony show.  Is there any other girls that want to see the one testicle?  Because then they could describe it for everyone else.  You look, you come back, you talk on the air and tell us what it looked like.  Right?  Yeah, we'll do it that way.  Right?  All right.  All right.  She's going to she's going to.  Yeah.  Wow.  What's your name?  Are you one testicle Ted?  One testicle, Gary.  What's your name?  Elaine.  Elaine, you want to see how long you've been drinking? 
[20:00]
 I only have one.  That's it.  One.  And Gary only has one.  Oh, you want to see.  You want to look too.  Yes.  Okay.  All right.  How are we going to do it?  Anyone else want to see Gary's testicle?  Any other girl?  It'll be a group shot.  We'll take care of it.  All right, Gary stand up and show these girls your testicle.  Right here?  Yeah.  Go.  Yeah.  We're going to something.  I sneak back over here.  Black girl will hide your ugly ass in the crowd.  Gary.  What am I going to do?  What am I going to do?  What am I going to do?  You're going to get some amazing looks, you know, in the background.  I sneak back over here. 
[20:30]
 Black girl will hide your ugly ass from the crowd.  Gary! Gary! Gary!  What am I getting out of this?  We'll take care of you trust me.  I will give you a little prize.  We'll give you some good stuff.  Come on the girls are waiting.  Gary's on his knees.  The girls are in front of Gary on their knees Anthony.  Back up a little Elaine. 
[21:00]
 I bet Rick wishes he was here.  Gary has undone his belts.  He's pulling down his pants.  Wow! Look at that!  It's true!  What am I doing?  What? You got a problem?  He just showed the one nut to the girls.  It looks like two fat ones that just came together.  It looks like two fat ones that came together.  That was one testicle.  That was one testicle. 
[21:30]
 What do you think of the one testicle?  I think it looks like a potato.  It looks like two nuts or one.  It just looks like one testicle.  Hey did you notice that the one testicle got bigger after they removed the...  because I looked and it was very large.  It's been eight years so it's probably just...  Maybe the one testicle became super testicle.  Freaky yes, nature.  I don't have a partner now I must become super testicle.  They'll be doing a special on Nova next week. 
[22:00]
 Alright.  Well let's hear it for Gary.  There's one testicle everyone.  A tragic story.  Five hours earlier you would have cut your nuts.  If I would have saved it I would have been fine.  Did you keep it in a jar or something?  I don't know but the doctor kind of had a little freaky look.  Really?  It could be sitting in the back of some office somewhere.  Well good luck to you.  Can you still perform and everything after one testicle?  Yes.  So it's no big deal right?  I know.  It's just a shock when it first appears.  Well that's the human body I'll be. 
[22:30]
 Look at the penis.  I already did it a couple times ago.  Look at you.  Hey honey you want to see penis?  I think you'll have some takers out here.  All the guys are starting to pull down their pants for it.  Alright we got lots more to come.  It's open to the broadcast and live.  You still have time to get down here.

I don't want no one steering on Yoshi's bike.  And I ride and almost trip on a vomit.  I'm a crazy Irishman. 
[30:30]
 Now Yoshi, you seem a little tank.  You are crazy!  More crazy than Yoshi!  You are not like a drinker of rice wine.  Rice wine?  No.  You drink beer.  You get all what Yoshi calls rocked up.  Now Yoshi, what happens when you drink a lot of beer?  Oh, my bicycle reeves all over the place. 
[31:00]
 Big trucks!  I try crossing roads.  A throat almost hit me.  I almost got hit by a big Irish throat.  Run me over.  Are you going to get hammered with our faithful listeners today?  Hey! Hey!  Huh? Hey?  Hey?  All right, listen.  Now listen.  Oh, very cute.  Look at you.  Hey!  Look at you.  I like that.  Yoshi, you got a fan in the audience there.  A berry button is pleased. 
[31:30]
 Yes.  Come on up here.  Do you like Yoshi?  Wow.  Here, sit down on this mic over here.  I just delivered some pork down the road.  I would like to deliver pork to you.  Pork?  Special Yoshi pork in cream sauce.  All you have is pork?  Hey!  Big pork.  Oh, big pork.  Ooh.  For me, it's big.  Hey, listen. 
[32:00]
 Yoshi's hung like an egg roll, man.  Well, maybe a spring roll.  A spring roll?  Hey.  All right, do you like Yoshi?  I like Yoshi.  I like egg rolls.  Oh, yeah.  I'll give you egg roll, honey.  It is not shrimp roll.  Hey, hey.  I take you.  You ride double on my back.  On my bike when I drive.  You ride on handlebar.  I don't need a handlebar.  Hold on to the handle behind you.

 We're bar that West 57th.  Do you like her?  My fortune cookies say intercourse in your future.  Stick around more stupidity with Opie and Anthony and WNEW, the Rock of New York.  One day, 27, WNEW, the Rock of New York.  Come along.  What it's like.  I say hi to Tina and Brooklyn.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We're broadcasting live with Barbeck, West 57th between 8th and 9th. 
[33:30]
 This crowd is absolutely nuts at this point.  All right.  We got to explain this, Anthony.  We had something incredible set up for you guys here.  We had, oh my God, now the mother's coming on stage.  Okay.  Let me explain.  Here's the deal.  All right.  Here's the deal.  What's the deal with that, baby?  You're kidding me.  When we were in commercials earlier, right?  Yeah.  We found out that these four sisters want to show their boobs all at the same time on 
[34:00]
 the stage.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And we were all set to do it, and then their mom showed up.  The mom showed up, and they came up and said, no, don't even mention this, that this is  going to happen.  But I mean, come on.  I think it's a verbal contract or something, right?  All right.  Someone shield the mom's eyes.  She doesn't want to see this.  Maybe mom could...  Wait a minute.  Mom just won a tour of La Barbat.  Mom's a grand tour.  It's one of the prizes here we're giving away. 
[34:30]
 It's a tour of La Barbat.  Start with the back corner.  All right.  Wait, Anthony.  Tom.  One of our faithful listeners have got to take one for the team and take mom to the  bar and do a couple shots with her so she doesn't see the mess that's about to happen  on the stage.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  All the sisters, I watch you sitting down at this microphone over here.  Look at this.  Are you girls attractive?  Look at this.  Isn't this great?  You guys have gorgeous blue eyes.  Errol, I hope you're taking pictures.  That must have been a great family to have during the high school years. 
[35:00]
 You girls must have been wild, right?  I can tell.  Very wild.  They are hammered.  Okay.  One at a time.  What's your name?  Jane.  Jane.  Okay.  Nice to meet you.  Andrea.  Andrea.  Jane.  Andrea.  Jackie.  I don't care what your names are.  And Elaine, the mess on my lap.  I think Elaine likes you, Albee.  I can tell.  How can you forget me?  Okay, listen. 
[35:30]
 Take it over because I'm ready to fall over here.  Well, we actually, I don't know, guys, do you want to see the quad flash?  The quad flash.  Do you want to see the quad flash?  I think we do.  All right, girls, get up.  Get up.  Yeah, yeah, let's see this.  Let's see this.  This could be a first.  You know how you will hear the loudest cheer from the crowd if we even attempt the quad 
[36:00]
 flash.  The quad flash, everyone.  We're talking octaboob here with the quad flash.  No one wants to see it.  And I get them closer to the stage.  Yeah, let's get.  All right.  How long you girls been at it today?  Huh?  Seven this morning?  Oh, 11.  11, okay.  That's a fireman's lifting up her shirt she doesn't even notice.  All right, guys.  You guys kick ass, man.  Do you guys want to see this or what, huh?  The four sisters.  Wow, look at this.  Your mother is drinking.  It's okay.  Trust me.  We took care of your mom. 
[36:30]
 She's doing a couple shots.  We're going to lift her up with surprises.  Mom's fine.  Mom's fine.  Actually, you know how I like freak shows.  I would love to see your mom up here doing the same thing with the sisters.  Wow, yeah, who wouldn't?  All right, ladies.  We're going to get started.  We're going to get started.  We're going to get started.  Let's all get ready for the quad flash.  Oh, no, that's okay.  You know what?  The one with...  What's your name?  The one with the short hair?  Hey, Ben.  Yeah, Ben.  Ben, you're going to be a good guy.  You're going to be a good guy.  You're going to be a good guy.  You're going to be a good guy.  You're going to be a good guy.  You're going to be a good guy.

The one with the short hair?  Hey, Ben.  Yeah, Ben, get out of the way.  The guys want to take shots of this, man.  Oh, man, I don't think they can do it.  No, Ben, the one with the short hair, what's wrong with you?  You guys, I think they...  It's a girl, Ben.  I know you have problems relating to women.  All right, you guys, I think they need some encouragement or this isn't going to happen.  I think they need some encouragement for the quad flash, Anthony.  Okay, the one with the short hair is the Killjoy. 
[37:30]
 She is saying, Mom's here and she's all upset.  She's wearing the pants up to her nips and everything.  Yeah, but that one's a dirty girl, right?  Yeah, I like her.  Yeah, you're a dirty girl, aren't you?  Yeah, you want to flash those boobies, don't you?  Yeah.  All right, no, don't molest the girls, guys.  All right, what is this?  All right, come on, guys.  Let's hear some encouragement here.  We need this to happen.  Come on.  Whip them out.  Whip them out. 
[38:00]
 Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  I think they're ready.  They're ready.  They're ready.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Look, they're unbuckling.  Here they go.  They're getting one.  Come on, girls, turn around.  Let them rip.  We're wasting valuable time here, girls.  Come on.  Did Mom ruin this whole thing?  No, they're going to ... No, no, look, she's getting ready.  She's ready.  I like you.  She's ready.  All right.  You're a dirty girl.  All right, you girls.  Ben.  Look, it's a mess.  All right. 
[38:30]
 Here.  Come on.  Come on.  You know what I feel like, Opi?  I feel like I'm at that party back when you were a kid and you thought you were going to  get some and you tried the whole night and really tried hard, but just nothing happened.  Let's go home with a bad taste of chafing.  Yeah, yeah, blue balls.  No, dude, get off the stage.  We don't want to see the guys.  This is like the dry hump. 
[39:00]
 This is not working.  Come on, ladies.  Come on, ladies.  Oh my God.  This is what we get for leaving Ben the fag in charge of the girls.  And, Op, they're so drunk right now.  I know.  There's no way to organize them.  Oh, no, there's here.  We can't do this.  Your mom's busy drinking.  Trust me.  Come on, girls.  Wait, wait. 
[39:30]
 Your mom knows.  I can't do it.  Your mom knows what you guys are all about.  Oh, the CT.  Well, once again, mom ruined it.  Thanks, mom.  Thanks, mom.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You wrecked everything.  The CT.  Hey, wait, wait, Anthony.  Is there any ladies out there that doesn't have their mom here that can help them out?  Yeah, that could be willing to come up and maybe give a little bit to the crowd here.  I mean, I think we're ready to see Jennifer again.  Oh, Jennifer rocks, man. 
[40:00]
 Ladies, get off the stage.  We'll show you how it's done.  Jennifer, get up here really fast.  Yes, Jennifer, you kick ass, man.  My God.  We love Jennifer.  Big CT to those girls.

Oh, real fast, because we're doing a lot of visual stuff. We're taking  a lot of pictures for the website. Now, this is weird. Scott Colombo is back in the station  putting all the clean pictures on the WNEW website. Boring, boring, boring. Well, he's  doing a good job, but they have to steer themselves clear at the WNEW website of the pictures 
[42:00]
 that show maybe some nip. So I'll be getting those, and tonight I'll put them on our website,  our secret little underground website. The good thing is what Scott is doing, he's giving  you a zip file of all the nudity, and we're going to put it on the semi-live studio cam.  So punch into our website. Later on tonight. You'll see those. All right. More to come.  It's Opie and Anthony broadcasting live, La Barbat, West 57th, between 8th and 9th, with  1027WAW, the Rock of New York.

Cheers to Killian's Red for throwing  the party, man. Oh, oh, well, yeah. Anthony's out. I've been asking for a beer for about  an hour now. I guess I got to go to the bar. All right, listen, if you can't make it. No,  no, that's okay. No secondhand beer. I don't want, I don't want backwash. This guy's giving 
[43:00]
