<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about the surprisingly low attendance at the New York Mets' opening day game.  John Montone reported finding zero Mets fans on the 7 train to Citi Field, prompting the hosts to use profanity-laced commentary on the team's unpopularity and poor ticket sales.  The conversation then shifted to a video of a frail Muhammad Ali's awkward and seemingly exploitative appearance at the Miami Marlins' opening day, where he was unable to throw the first pitch due to his Parkinson's disease.  The hosts and callers expressed disgust and outrage at the Marlins and Ali's family, using highly offensive language to describe the event as sad and exploitative.  Speculation about the family's motives fueled the heated discussion.

A caller, Nate from Little Rock, Arkansas, ignited a further contentious exchange by calling Ali a "shaky fuck" and a "draft dodger," leading to a heated debate about Ali's actions during the Vietnam War and his legacy. This segment was rife with highly offensive and derogatory language. The discussion circled back to the Marlins game, commenting on the new stadium and the overall lack of baseball enthusiasm in Miami, before returning to further commentary on the Ali incident and the hosts' reflections on his career.

The show continued with a comparison of Ali's refusal to serve in Vietnam to Pat Tillman's sacrifice in the military. The hosts debated the relative weight of their actions, using profane language and digressing into various unrelated topics. This transitioned to a discussion of a viral Jimmy Kimmel video featuring a sedated woman after wisdom teeth extraction, leading to commentary on the ethics of filming and dentists' actions.  A news story about a McDonald's employee with a purported Mega Millions winning ticket followed, prompting discussion of her alleged dishonesty.  A Burger King commercial starring Mary J. Blige, which faced criticism for perceived negative stereotypes, was then analyzed, triggering a lengthy discussion about online anonymity and the use of pseudonyms on racist websites. The hosts shared strong, offensively-worded opinions on freedom of speech and its limitations, particularly online.

The next segment began with Jim Norton expressing frustration with indirect expression of controversial opinions,  followed by a caller, Pat Duffy, recounting his girlfriend’s firing for a pin-up photo on Twitter.  This sparked a debate on employers' control over employees' online presence and the hypocrisy surrounding free speech, using the Westboro Baptist Church as an example.  The hosts discussed legal limitations on free speech, again mentioning the Mary J. Blige commercial and Joe Ture, before briefly mentioning upcoming guests Eugene Levy and Maggie Grace. A promotional segment for "Unmatchables" with Jim Jefferies and Justine Jolie, featuring explicit sexual humor, aired. Listener emails and calls regarding free speech and the "yelling fire in a movie theater" analogy were addressed. The conversation then veered to the Masters golf tournament, a viral video of a hole-in-one, and Augusta National's men-only policy, prompting a misogynistic segment with offensive jokes and comments targeting women. A caller recounted a firehouse incident highlighting tensions between men and women in traditionally male-dominated environments, followed by a discussion about differing fitness standards for male and female firefighters.  The segment concluded with a sexually charged and vulgar phone call from Florine, including racial slurs, followed by Maggie Grace's delayed and awkward arrival and a short interview about her roles in *Lost* and *Lockout*.

The interview with Maggie Grace discussed a YouTube clip from one of her movies, her new film *Lockout*, her time on *Lost*, including the death of her character and relationships with other cast members, and her dating life.  This was followed by an in-studio interview with Eugene Levy.  Levy discussed his career,  *SCTV*, *American Reunion*, Christopher Guest films, improvisation, and his memories of John Candy. He also talked about his role in *Goon*.  The hosts promoted *Lockout* and *American Reunion*.

Further discussion of *American Reunion* with Eugene Levy, drawing comparisons to Monty Python, led to the "What Did You Learn Today?" segment. This segment devolved into a heated, expletive-laden argument between Troy and a former intern, Francine, involving numerous insults and sexually explicit remarks from all parties. The discussion veered into tangents about interns' performance, a video of a drugged-up child, and a Bruce Springsteen concert, concluding with Francine promoting an LSAT prep service.  The show then played an audio clip of Opie's young son.

The final segment included a discussion about a listener’s WrestleMania trip and a gift for Opie, Jim Norton's upcoming appearance on Hannity, Troy promoting his mixtape and DJ gigs, and abruptly ended due to time constraints, cutting off a discussion about the gift. The show concluded with a chaotic outburst including a declaration of being gay and performing oral sex on men.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Wake the fuck up!  What the fuck is going on?!  We're waking you up.  You ought to love it.  It's a privilege to hear our voices.  This is so cool.  This is fucking hysterically funny.  Oh, this is a good radio right here.  Yes.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah!  One minute you're acting like an intelligent guy,  the next minute you're acting like a big giant ass.  He's got a giant fire!  Oh my God!  Fucking brilliant, man.  Really funny shit.  Arousing in perverse and interesting ways.  It's like an audio rape. 
[00:00:30]  Yes.  It's amazing.  This is the best show ever.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The most popular show in the history of satellite radio.  But enough of this palaver!  Let's get the show on the road!  Let's do this, mother effers!  Wow, there we go.  Hi.  Good morning.  Hi.  Hi there.  Come on.  I got a double welcome.  I got the dual welcome this morning.  Welcome, welcome.  And I went, thank you, thank you.  Yeah.  Let's tape that shit.  I know.  I think that could go viral. 
[00:01:00]  Good morning.  Happy opening day to everybody.  Opening day.  Yeah.  Did you hear the John Montone piece today?  John Montone.  No, what was he doing?  Well, I've been a suffering New York Mets fan for a very long time.  And for years continued to say I was a Mets fan.  Yeah.  And then, you know what?  One of the listeners, probably a hater, pointed out that I'm not really a Mets fan. 
[00:01:30]  And instead of getting all mad and fucking tweeting back or something, I sat back for a second and went, holy fuck, he's right.  I haven't been a Mets fan in years.  I just kind of always just kept telling people, yes, I'm a Mets fan.  I'm a Mets fan, right?  But the guy goes, I bet you can't even name the starting lineup.  And I sat there, and instead of Googling it, I went, oh, my God, I can't anymore.  Oh, yeah.  With that said, John Montone was out at Citi Field because it's opening day for the Mets today.  He was on a packed seven train. 
[00:02:00]  Now, the seven train is what brings people in and out of Citi Field.  It is the train to be on if you're a Mets fan.  Sure.  It's the epicenter of Mets fans commuting, right?  Yeah.  He couldn't find one fucking Mets fan on the seven train.  Oh, really?  That's how fucking frustrated New York is with this team.  No one wants to step forward and even say they're a Mets fan.  And then in the paper today, there's a whole article where they're basically begging people to come to the stadium. 
[00:02:30]  They're basically having all sorts of deals and free tickets if you do this and that, blah, blah, blah.  They're in deep shit.  They haven't sold out this afternoon's game.  They haven't sold out opening day.  Opening day.  Opening day is usually a given where it's like, you know what?  Everybody goes.  Because, you know, yeah, we all have a chance.  It's the first day of the season.  Let's go.  It's exciting.  Yeah.  They're doing, like, buy one, get one deals where, like, you buy an opening day ticket, you get a free ticket to one of this weekend's games.  Holy fuck.  Well, maybe it's going to be crappy weather or something, right? 
[00:03:00]  It's not supposed to be beautiful today.  Oh, see.  It's a nice one o'clock game.  One o'clock game.  Beautiful spring day.  It's literally a perfect day to go see baseball.  And it's not like they're 20 games out.  So you're like, why the fuck would I do that?  Yeah.  Everyone kind of feels like their team has a chance the first couple weeks of the season, right?  Well, you know.  And they're not even close to a sellout.  And Montone couldn't find one fucking fan on the seven train.  If they pull out a miracle and start doing well this season, I know it is.  But if they just did, you'd see people that were like, I was there right from the start, man. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You know?  No, it's impossible.  I mean, who's our star even?  Johan Santana.  Yeah, all right.  Today's opening day?  Today's opening day, part three.  Part three, right.  We had the Japanese opening day.  Right.  And we had the, what?  Yeah, opening night last night.  Opening night.  Yes, Jimmy, it's opening day.  This is a big day.  We played last night.  Marlins Cardinals.  Oh, that's a big game.  Well, we're going to get into the Marlins Cardinals thing.  Oh, my God. 
[00:04:00]  Opening day.  When will the Mets win the World Series?  Never.  Never.  But, so, I'm going to say it this year.  I'm officially not a Mets fan, okay?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, it's official now.  I'm officially a Phillies fan this year.  Officu.  Officu-y.  Oh, you're going to Philly, huh?  I've gone to more Phillies games in the last eight years than Mets games.  You got the, what they call the in-law sports team thing going on. 
[00:04:30]  In-laws and a lot of friends down there.  And I've gotten more Phillies games.  I go to about two or three Phillies games a year.  Yeah.  Easily.  So, I'm still kind of a baseball fan.  I haven't been to Citi Field yet.  That's a big heel turn right there.  That really is.  Is it really?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Is it really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm adopting the Phillies for a little while.  Sorry.  Might have to adopt the Flyers soon, too, for a little while.  Stupid fucking Islanders are three games under .500.  And my ticket broker, no, really?  You got to buy your tickets this year. 
[00:05:00]  They're really going to turn it around.  And I get to sit here as the season ends for the Islanders knowing I made a great decision.  You should record those phone calls every year.  Oh, I will.  I'll record the next one.  The yearly, hey, we're going to be better.  Oh, God.  Buy your tickets.  And I did go to one or two hockey games this year.  The fucking place is even in war-shaped than last year.  Sam's a big fan.  Ready for opening day.  Sam's wearing a Cubs hat.  And it's enraging because he doesn't know anything about baseball. 
[00:05:30]  What's going on?  Cubs fan?  We know more about wrestling than you know about baseball.  You know that, right?  Yeah, that's probably true.  But you at one point watched wrestling.  At no point in my life would I consider myself a baseball fan.  You've never watched baseball on a regular basis?  No, not on a regular basis.  I mean, I was going to say I have watched single games before.  Growing up before cell phones, computers, and all that, man, I easily watched 50 games  a year.  Easily.  No way.  I don't think I've watched 50 games in my life.  Really?  No.  Definitely not.  Well, why do the Cubs have that? 
[00:06:00]  It's blue and red.  Why blue and red today?  My shirt's red.  Why have you all of a sudden started doing this?  This is a new thing.  Don't say it isn't.  No, I know.  This is a new thing.  Because I got tired of looking at me.  I look the same every day.  And I wanted to do something different.  Why baseball hats?  You've done the Padres, the Cubs.  What was the other one again?  Oh, I forgot.  The Rockies.  Well, because I didn't want to cut my hair.  Why not?  Cut your hair for your wedding.  I'm not going to cut it.  How about you trim it up for your wedding?  Because I don't want to do something permanently different. 
[00:06:30]  I just want to do something that...  Oh, today...  You're going to regret it in the pictures when you get older.  Yeah, you look at those pictures and you're an asshole.  You're going to look back and go, oh, what was I doing?  But I have years of pictures of my hair like this.  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  Just trim it up.  Let me tell you about another guy.  That had crazy hair.  That had crazy hair and a ponytail and took a lot of pictures.  He looks back at those and says, what the fuck was I thinking?  You know who that was?  Who? 
[00:07:00]  Mitch Kumpstein.  Mitch fucking Kumpstein.  Tell us one thing about the Chicago Cubs.  I'm going to wear the fucking hat.  Wrigley Field.  All right.  All right.  Good enough.  Yep.  Fair enough.  Do you understand the curse that goes on up there?  I understand they're not...  They've got a big curse up there.  I know they don't win terribly often.  Well, they win.  I mean, like, championships?  Do they?  No, I don't win championships.  When was the last time they won a championship?  What do you guess?  1918. 
[00:07:30]  It's probably not far off.  It's close.  Yeah.  No, I have no idea.  1939.  Oh, fuck.  What a great year that was.  They'd be happy if it was 1910.  Oh, really?  Yeah, they would be...  Where year was it?  I have no idea.  1922.  1908?  I think it was 19...  Oh?  Oh, you don't even know.  I think Jimmy's about right.  Danny would have.  1908.  Ah!  I'm teasing you.  I'm teasing you. 
[00:08:00]  I'm teasing you.  Travis, do you know?  It's 1908.  I think it's 1908, yeah.  I want to thank Travis for depressing the fuck out of me last night.  I was checking my Twitter and Travis tweeted something he saw on Deadspin.  Oh, man.  They fucking dragged Muhammad Ali out at the Marlins game.  This organization, they're a bunch of scumbags for doing this, period.  And people should talk about this today.  If you remember Muhammad Ali, what Olympics was it where he was shaking but he had the torch?  He had the torch.  He walked up those stairs, right? 
[00:08:30]  Dramatically for the world.  That was 96?  Yeah.  Well, they dragged him out on a golf cart from center field at the Marlins game as they opened  up their new stadium last night.  And it wasn't the same effect as the Olympic moment.  Yeah, it was very, very depressing.  I think the organization is a bunch of scumbags.  I think his wife is a scumbag.  I think his family in general is just a bunch of scumbags.  Yeah, it was not.  I mean, we can make jokes all we want, but you got to see what he fucking looks like. 
[00:09:00]  And who thought this was a good idea?  And I think someone pointed out after a minute, the crowd stops applauding because I think  he's on the big screen and they're just like, what the fuck is going on here?  Yeah, it's like a hole.  Well, they wheel him out from center field.  Center field.  So it takes the absolute longest amount of time possible.  Right.  Yeah, they can't really goose the golf cart either because he's kind of frail.  Well, they thought it would be a nice dramatic moment for everyone, but it was a, holy shit,  look what Muhammad Ali looks like nowadays moment.  And there was a lot of speculation before this because somebody figured out that the 
[00:09:30]  Marlins had allotted five minutes for the opening pitch.  So people were thinking it's going to be somebody big that's going to get a lot of applause.  You know, but now you find out that it was five minutes because they had to wheel him out.  Oh, yeah.  Did you hear that?  He was there to throw out the first pitch.  So, yeah, yeah.  Guess what?  He can't throw anything.  The guy who can't stand.  He can't even throw a piece of paper into a wastebasket.  He doesn't even know he's there, it seems like.  They said mentally he's aware. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, that's a nightmare.  Yeah, that's a nightmare then.  This is way more visual.  So you're going to, I mean, Travis tweeted it.  I tweeted it.  It's on Deadspin.  It's all over.  It's an easy find today.  We'll put it on our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony.  It's titled The Marlins Open Their New Stadium in the Saddest, Most Awkward Way Possible.  That's the title of the video.  And it is sad and awkward.  It's a visual, but we'll try to walk it through.  How come our listeners can't see this with us?  Oh, because? 
[00:10:30]  Oh, because there is no visual element.  Yeah.  Someone on Twitter goes, don't block me, but isn't a visual element TV?  Radio with a visual element.  Oh, television.  That is kind of funny.  That person made me laugh, but not really.  Just every once in a while.  You know, the difference would be if you're in your car, you could still listen to the  whole fucking show and not feel like you're missing anything, but we could enhance it for  people that are in front of their computers or, you know, got something going on on their  cell phone.  They could just go online and watch us with this. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, they could check out some shit.  But it's like, it would be nice to have a central location to do things from and be able  to, you know, have people watch, have people watch us reacting to it on maybe a split  screen kind of a thing.  Yeah, exactly.  Like, you know, like I'm getting tickled.  It is the future.  Yes, the future.  But the future doesn't.  Look out, people.  The future's here.  The future doesn't live here at SiriusXM, unfortunately.  That's the past here.  Oh, no.  This is the status quo slash past at this point.  It's too bad. 
[00:11:30]  Anyway, hit this.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the field Miami Marlins owner, Jeffrey Lauria and  a man who first won the heavyweight championship of the world right here in Miami.  Oh.  The greatest of all time, Muhammad Ali.  So now people are like, they're a little excited.  Who wouldn't want to see Muhammad Ali?  Oh, the golf cart's doing like one half a mile an hour. 
[00:12:00]  They're going to milk this.  Oh, God.  This is terrible.  He's really thin.  He's frail.  Oh, God.  And I think Ant said it.  He looks like he's playing the bar goes.  Yeah, he looks like Babalu.  Oh, he's kind of lost control of his hand, too.  Yeah, his hand is shaking up and down rapidly.  And then the Marlins owner's trying to hold his left hand down for him.  Look, the Marlins, the owner there is holding his left hand tight and hard, and Ali's still  able to make it move.  All right. 
[00:12:30]  Well, he's gotten off the warning track, and the people are starting to...  That's the chant, because they're starting to see what he looks like on the big screen.  He's still shaking.  Oh, boy.  His wife's there smiling, and then it looks like family members, possibly maybe a son  or a nephew or something on the back, is filming the whole thing through their cell phone.  Oh, man.  They're very excited to be there.  Now the players are milling about in the infield, waiting, and it's just very awkward. 
[00:13:00]  They just stopped the golf cart.  The crowd, again, just trying to get something going, because it's just awkward to stand there  in silence and watch Muhammad Ali shaking on the big screen.  They should still be clapping, though.  That was not that long of an applause.  No, it really wasn't.  Because they're in shock.  Yeah, they might be kind of in shock.  They might be in shock.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Because look at them all standing around now, like, oh, my God, are we witnessing this?  And they're probably talking to each other, like, how the fuck is he going to throw out  the first pitch?  Right.  That's a mind boggler. 
[00:13:30]  And now the players are all looking around, like, uh...  And he tries to get the crowd back into chanting Ali.  I hated the way the announcers did that.  Ali.  Ali.  Because everyone is uncomfortable.  And now the...  Does he have the baseball?  He has the baseball in his hand, and he just kind of hands it over.  That's it.  That's the first pitch.  And that's the first pitch.  He handed the baseball over. 
[00:14:00]  And no one's cheering that he just did that.  Because they don't know.  Now it delayed cheer.  Now they're shaking pictures.  Ali's in bad shape.  Oh, he's in horrid shape.  He doesn't even know.  He's not...  He can't turn his head.  And God only knows why he's wearing those sunglasses.  His eyes must be going around in his head like those ones where you...  They're on the springs.  You know, when you put the glass in, your eyeballs are on the springs.  Muhammad Ali here by the Marlins Park here tonight.  And then the announcer just making believe it's a totally normal moment. 
[00:14:30]  Holy shit, ladies and gentlemen.  He says handing off the ceremonial first pitch.  He didn't even know what he was doing.  And then they got to show...  They grabbed the ball out of his hand.  Now they're showing pictures of when he was young and vibrant.  I didn't like those fans, though.  I know they were in shock, but they should have...  They would have done that in New York.  Yeah, yeah, right.  They literally would have applauded until he fucking left.  I think it was such a shock to see him like that, that people were just...  Yeah.  Didn't know what to do. 
[00:15:00]  His heart...  His handshaking...  Well, why would his family and his people agree to this?  I mean, he had such an amazing moment at the Olympics with that torch.  And now it's opening day.  Why drag him out?  Opening day for a Marlins game where they're opening up a new stadium?  Are you serious?  I wonder if he has a financial interest in the team.  No.  No?  He doesn't have a financial interest in anything.  Or if they're selling his stuff.  He doesn't have an interest in anything, matter of fact.  No, I think he's just...  I mean, they may have paid him, but...  It's a bad shit.  He doesn't have anything to do with the team.  Yeah, you don't give a fuck.  I didn't like those fans. 
[00:15:30]  I thought they should have...  I think you're right, Jimmy.  Yeah.  They should have applauded those Florida...  Those dummies in Florida.  It should have applauded until he left.  Yeah.  They would have done that in Yankee Stadium or Shea Stadium.  New York fans...  I don't know.  Absolutely would have.  I think there was a shock thing going on there.  Maybe, but they got to get through it.  I don't know.  You saw it.  Yeah.  We didn't even go for the jokes because we're like, holy fuck, look at what he looks like.  Yeah.  But I would still applaud him.  I mean, I would still stand there and...  They started.  They started applauding.  And they fucking applauded for like a minute. 
[00:16:00]  They stopped.  They were shitty.  They were terrible fans.  Terrible.  How good could they be to that for a fucking Marlins game?  How invested in anything can they really be?  Yeah.  Miami Marlins.  Miami Marlins.  Oh my God, that's right.  Miami Marlins.  Do they move locations?  Well, they got this brand new stadium.  Opening day for their brand new stadium down there.  Terrible thing in the outfield.  Have you seen that?  That goes off when somebody hits a home run?  What is it?  I did not see it.  Oh no.  What do they do? 
[00:16:30]  I know they got a roof.  A roof.  I fucking hate roofs.  A roof.  Especially in baseball.  Baseball don't need roofs.  Especially in baseball.  Because, you know, if it rains in the summer, it's a nice warm rain.  Who cares?  Yeah.  It's part of baseball.  Who doesn't love a good rain delay?  Right.  Who doesn't love watching the tarp being brought out on the field?  Especially Miami when it's hot as balls.  I think most of those people would love to get rained on to get cooled off.  I think that your ass is wet in the seat for the rest of the game.  You don't like the rain? 
[00:17:00]  I hate fucking rain at sporting events.  You would like this new stadium.  Yeah, maybe I would.  As soon as the sprinkles come, they fucking put that roof on.  No, that's not real.  Yeah, that's what's out in the outfield.  If somebody hits a home run, that goes off.  That's a cartoon version of it, isn't it?  Yeah, but I mean, I wanted you to see what it looks like animatronically.  It's a bunch of Marlins.  Jumping out of the water?  Like on a kind of a shooting gallery rotisserie thing.  And they jump around.  Who thought that would be a good idea?  In a colorful, acid-trip-looking sea. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, it's really cool.  No, it's not.  It stinks.  Those fans deserve that for that applause.  They deserve that.  Wow, there you go.  They deserve that.  We got a Marlins fan on the line.  He says, more amazing thing than Ali is we had more than 600 fans in our stands.  That's good.  Yeah, this is a small stadium.  Is it?  It's like 37,000.  They went with a small stadium.  37,000?  Why did they do that?  Kevin Hart can sell out their fucking baseball stuff.  It's more intimate. 
[00:18:00]  Some guy was pitching it going like, we want a more intimate setting here.  Because they know it's impossible to get 50,000, 60,000 out there.  So they're like, let's cut our losses and have a cool, small stadium.  It's not a baseball town.  No, it's not.  Florida's not a baseball state.  No, it's not.  We're a fucking boxing state, obviously.  Shitheads.  It's all about soccer down there.  Terrible.  37,000, that's it?  Yeah.  What's Citi Field?  I don't even know.  If you had to guess.  Probably 75.  No, no, a little less.  Oh, really?  I don't think you had to guess.  75. 
[00:18:30]  No, maybe 60?  Maybe around 50.  50 or 60, maybe.  Maybe pushing 60, I would guess.  Citi Field.  I'm very annoyed at those Marlin fans.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know.  45,000.  Oh, just 45,000.  Also, it's not that much smaller.  Yeah.  Sometimes in life, you've got to get through your own awkwardness and do the right thing.  Yeah.  True.  He looks horrendous.  I'm more pissed at his fucking family.  Let him be.  He probably didn't even know he was doing that.  He did look pretty out there.  Yeah, he looked out of it.  He didn't look around at all. 
[00:19:00]  He was just like, you know, looking sort of down.  It doesn't even look like he can turn his head.  It's like, sleeping has to be impossible.  How do you shake like that and try to sleep?  I can tell you.  I had a friend whose father had the Muhammad Ali thing.  Yeah.  And it gets so bad that they can't even sleep at night because you're just waking yourself  up constantly with the shaking.  There's got to be some kind of Rube Goldberg machine where you could put a rope on your  arm that's shaking and transfer the energy to rock your bed to sleep.  You know, it goes through all kinds of machines and gears and pulleys. 
[00:19:30]  That's not a bad idea.  And then you just fucking, all right, it cancels it out because it's gently rocking.  You might have to go on Shark Tank with that one.  Yes.  Mark Cuban would love to hear that idea.  Parkinson sucks, dude.  I mean, he's on medication right now.  And look, he's still shaking like a motherfucker.  That's terrible.  He's making a Carl from Sling Blade face, too.  It's terrible.  Oh, my God.  His face is like.  I still want to meet him.  It's fucking depressing.  Carl.  No, Carl.  I've met him.  Was he going to have Parkinson's or was this from boxing? 
[00:20:00]  Probably Parkinson's.  You see a lot of boxers that don't turn out like that.  Like, I've never seen anyone else like that.  Didn't they first say that a lot of this shit was from boxing?  He punched drunk, they called it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Punch drunk.  Yeah, that's special.  That's great.  Yeah.  It's like shell-shocked.  In the old days, they would just say that.  Last year of his career, maybe last two, he got hit pretty good.  Yeah, he got some bad ones, man.  It's too bad because before that, he didn't get hit a lot.  No.  It sucks, too, because of the personality he was before.  Everyone remembers that fast-talking with him and Cosell going at it, and to then just 
[00:20:30]  be relegated to shaking in a golf cart like that is to lackluster applause from Florida  douchebags.  I'm fucking disgusted with those fans.  Even if they were shocked and appalled, because it's him, you rise above it, and you fucking  treat it like it's 1970.  Well, we got Nate.  We got these guys out there.  Let's get to the other side of this.  Nate in Little Rock, Arkansas. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, man.  Hey, Jimmy.  Why are you so high on Muhammad Ali?  He's a fucking draft dodger, shaky fuck, and glad he hit himself in the nuts.  It makes me feel better about myself.  Are you just being cute, sir, and stupid?  Oh, God.  You know, I may be being stupid, but I don't have this fucking love for Muhammad Ali.  He was a fucking boxer.  Yeah, everybody in the world knew who he was.  Fuck him.  He was bigger, actually, than...  Hold on, hold on.  He was bigger than the sports, sir.  He wasn't a draft dodger.  He just refused to go.  Draft dodger...  Hold on.  Let me correct you. 
[00:21:30]  Draft dodgers...  I was going to explain it to you, Nate.  Please.  Yeah, if you keep babbling, we're just going to hang up on you.  If you want to go back and forth, we'll talk to you.  I love this idea.  He didn't run away and hide.  He just said, I'm not going.  He said, no Vietnamese ever called me nigger.  And what are you going to call him, a coward?  I mean, the guy...  Come on.  He just...  Jimmy, because he fucking...  And it turns out he was right.  It turns out he was right.  Why the fuck should we get killed for their civil war? 
[00:22:00]  You can make fun of your hand.  You can make fun of a dead baby, but a fucking shaky nigger, you can't fucking stand it.  I didn't say you couldn't make fun of him.  I'm just saying you're wrong.  I'm not offended by what you said.  Why can't they fucking cheer for him like he's the fucking president of the United States?  Fuck him.  He was a great fucking...  He's the most important fucking athlete to ever live.  He's the most important athlete to ever live?  Yeah.  What can we do?  What was so great?  Did he bring the world together?  Fuck him.  I'm glad he...  No, he actually stood up for what he believed in, and he fucking didn't allow having the championship 
[00:22:30]  taken away from him.  Because had he gone into the military, they would have protected him.  He never would have seen battle.  He would have gone from base to base to base, and he would have done shows and entertained  troops.  He would have suffered absolutely no physical injury, and he knew that.  But he didn't believe in it, so he sacrificed his championship for it.  In the prime of his career, he gave up millions of fucking dollars, and the championship belt,  and he came back and fucking regained it.  He sacrificed his own popularity, too. 
[00:23:00]  Of course he did.  And his image at that point.  Because of what he believed in.  He knew what would happen to him if he said no to the war.  You're just trying to be edgy and dangerous.  But the bottom line is, if you don't understand that Muhammad Ali was an important guy, you're  a dummy.  I didn't say he wasn't important, but because he's sitting there shaking with Parkinson's,  we've got to cheer for him for 10 fucking minutes?  Well, more than one minute.  And no, you don't have to cheer for him.  You can be the edgy guy that sits there anonymously and calls him a shaky nigger.  You can be that guy.  You wouldn't say that if you were there, of course. 
[00:23:30]  Well, how about, but it's okay to make fun of Connor, the little fucking dead baby?  I've already said you didn't offend me by making fun of him.  I'm not offended by your, by your crass humor, Nate.  I just think you're a dumb motherfucker.  But it's okay to make fun of dead babies.  I heard you already.  You're good, funny man.  But you can't make fun of a guy that's got Parkinson's?  You can just keep repeating.  Is this how you argue after your wife doesn't want to fuck you?  You just keep saying the same things?  I heard you.  I want you to face.  Good.  I'm sure you do, because you're a tough dude, Nate. 
[00:24:00]  You're not an offensive guy.  You're not like, oh, God, I couldn't believe that guy said that.  You're just dumb.  Actually, I'm not.  You're not making a very valid argument about Muhammad Ali, because he was a fighter.  He was very famous.  You got to cheer for the guy, because he has Parkinson's.  It makes zero sense.  Well, because you've probably never done anything that meant anything in your life.  You're just a nobody.  You don't understand what it's like to have a lot and then be willing to throw it out for something you believe in, which he did.  So you have nothing, and you stand for nothing, so you don't give a fuck. 
[00:24:30]  You're just a fucking, you're a barnacle, so you don't give a shit.  Ali was the world champion, and he sacrificed everything he had and refused to go and fight.  If you can't see the significance of that, you're just a dumb, nobody motherfucker.  I'm under your skin funny, man.  I just think it's so funny.  I'm not angry at you.  I just think you're a dope.  Again, stop trying to play this role. 
[00:25:00]  Like, you're this guy who says that.  You're that guy who does that.  You just, you got nothing.  I didn't say anything about myself.  Why don't you get the shit out of your ears and listen to me?  Yeah, funny man.  I heard what you said, edgy, anonymous guy.  I heard what you said.  Dangerous guy.  Uh-oh, look out, Nate's coming.  Watch out for what he might say.  I guess I'm not anonymous, and my name is Nate from Little Rock.  I don't know if that's really your name.  I don't really care what your name is.  But you're not making a valid point.  You just wanted to say mean things about Ali. 
[00:25:30]  But you do understand the significance.  So you're lying.  You're just a fucking liar.  I understand Muhammad Ali is a world-famous athlete.  So you don't understand the significance of sacrificing the World Heavyweight Championship,  which is the most prestigious title in sports.  It's the most prestigious title a human being can hold in sports.  Especially back then.  Maybe not so much these days.  Yeah, absolutely.  But back then, the whole world would watch these boxing matches.  In the prime of his career.  I want to add this to the...  So the show chose not to make fun of Ali as far as this clip goes. 
[00:26:00]  I mean, we do have a history over the years of making fun of Ali and his shaking, by the way.  I was going to say something about putting a shammy in his hand after I watched the car.  Right?  Is that okay, Nate?  Yeah, Nate, you're not...  Again, you're not being offensive.  You're just a dummy.  I personally like when we have some human moments every once in a while on this show.  So, but, I mean, the history has proven that we've had our jokes as far as Ali and his condition go.  Let me ask you this, Jimmy.  Would you have had the same feeling about Elvis if he decided not to go over to the war? 
[00:26:30]  It would depend on why he did it and what he sacrificed to do it.  I'm going to kill some gooks.  I'm going to chop some ears.  I'm going to lead the children so I can shoot them in.  And I believed Ali.  When he didn't go, I believe him.  It wasn't a bullshit publicity stunt.  He just didn't believe in it.  You were two years old when you didn't go.  Well, obviously, but I still...  So I can't talk about the Civil War because I wasn't alive?  You dunce.  I still know what happened.  You can't tell me what your thoughts were back then.  Nate.  I'm telling you what my thoughts are now, Nate, you fucking dummy.  Viva Hanoi! 
[00:27:00]  But then again, if that's your thinking, why would you ask me how I felt about Elvis knowing that I wasn't alive when that happened?  Don't be inconsistent.  You were alive when Elvis happened.  But you know what's funny?  No, when he went to the war, I wasn't.  I was in a rebel in nursery school standing up believing in Muhammad Ali if you believed in it when you were two years old.  The bottom line is you're lying right now.  You're not being honest.  You don't really feel this way.  And you know why it's significant what he did.  So don't pretend you don't.  I understand the significance of Muhammad Ali.  I don't understand how you are being inconsistent where you can make fun of dead people. 
[00:27:30]  But you keep repeating yourself, again, like you probably do when your wife doesn't want to fuck.  You just keep saying the same thing.  I've already said, I don't care if you make fun of it.  You're both saying the same thing.  You're both saying the same thing.  I don't care what your opinion is on it.  But the one thing about Muhammad Ali, which was amazing, like he had all his popularity, he had the championship belt, and then he gave it all up because of what he did.  The fucking country hated the guy.  Parts of the world hated the guy. 
[00:28:00]  And he turned the whole fucking thing around and was immensely popular by the end of his career.  Well, he didn't turn it around everywhere, apparently.  Oh, no.  Not in Little Rock.  Yeah, but just a little cunt, Nate.  You're a little fucking cunt.  I love little cunts.  You know what, I'm not edgy funny, but you really are a little cunt.  You know what, Tim?  I'm not, but you keep telling me I'm repeating myself, but you're saying the same thing ten times.  So it's okay for you to do it, but I can't do it.  Because I'm coming from an honest place.  You're trying to be the dangerous guy who says outrageous things that you'd never fucking say if you weren't on the phone. 
[00:28:30]  You're a cunt.  I would say it to you if I saw you.  Not me you'd say it.  Of course me you'd say it to.  But no, you wouldn't say that in a group of people.  You're the guy who likes to whisper shit with the fucking car windows rolled up.  You're a cunt.  Don't talk to me like that, Jimmy.  All right.  Thanks, Nate.  I really do hope you get fucking cancer and die.  And I'm not even being funny.  I really do hope you're killed.  Any type of cancer?  It doesn't make a difference.  It doesn't matter to me. 
[00:29:00]  I just hope you suffer.  That's scary karma shit.  That's scary karma shit.  I'll stop listening to you, so I'll keep your station on.  You just keep listening, bitch.  All right.  I'll see you this weekend, Nate.  Take care, Nate.  Coming over to the house.  I'm just going to hang out.  What a little cunt.  It took a lot of balls for Muhammad Ali to do what he did.  A lot of people absolutely didn't agree with what he did back then.  But then I want to make the point again.  He turned it all around.  And he was immensely popular by the end.  Anybody.  He loved him by the end of it.  Anybody who says that who just doesn't understand the significance of Ali is a dummy. 
[00:29:30]  It's just a dummy.  And ended up helping the world through his popularity.  Of course.  The amount of charity the guy did and all that shit.  Right.  If you really want to get into it.  Yeah.  You know, but he realized that, you know, he had to stand up for what he believed.  And he sacrificed a lot to do that.  Right, right, right.  There are a lot of guys out there that sacrificed their lives, of course, and all that.  I get it.  But he gave up millions of dollars.  Yeah, he knew what he was about to do was going to deeply affect his career and his life. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  And somehow he turned the whole fucking thing around.  And he gave it up when he was fucking in his prime.  In his prime of his career.  Yeah.  And he came back three years later and won.  I remember watching Ali and hating him because everyone else did.  I was too young to understand, but I knew I was supposed to hate Ali.  Child of the Hakes.  Yeah, because I still wasn't thinking for myself.  So I just knew that everyone else hated Ali.  Yeah, I hate this fucking guy.  And I remember something changing in me and everyone around me where all of a sudden you started liking the guy again.  That's crazy, right? 
[00:30:30]  That's how big of a personality he was.  But, yeah, people loved or hated him.  I never.  I don't remember, like, people hating him.  I remember him being a lot.  I remember people being.  Oh, they hated him.  I mean, me remembering.  I don't remember that personally.  I just remember him being kind of Cosell's foil.  Right.  I don't remember him being hated.  When he first came back, they were hoping that they were going to knock his fucking head right off.  They fucking hated him.  I'm trying to think what fight turned it around, where it started going the other way. 
[00:31:00]  Foreman, maybe?  Maybe when he started getting a little older.  Frazier.  But the first few years when he came back, they fucking hated him.  Was it Foreman or Frazier that he lost?  He beat Foreman before he came back and beat Frazier, I think.  Yeah.  That could be going out of order.  I know Foreman was a massive, because the country, I know in Africa they didn't like Foreman at all.  No.  Fought Foreman, fought Frazier, fought Dix.  Might have been the Foreman-Ali fight.  Yeah, might have been. 
[00:31:30]  Might have been.  I don't know.  Man.  All right, we got Jim in Dallas.  Jim.  Hey.  Hi, Jim.  What is it?  Tornado coming?  Why don't you talk?  Hey, that tornado almost wiped me out, by the way.  Oh, well, sorry.  But it didn't, so what do you got for today?  I'm a veteran, and the guy turned his back on the country.  He fights for his own country.  I don't get a fucking somebody to call him a nigger or whatever.  He fucking turned his back on the country. 
[00:32:00]  He didn't fight for nobody.  No, he didn't.  He didn't shoot away, yeah.  He gave up, what?  And then he still kept his million.  Joe Lewis is the one you all should be talking about.  Well, we're not talking about Joe Lewis.  You ain't never been right.  I do respect Joe Lewis.  But because he didn't want to go and fight, he didn't want to go and fight a civil war for  Vietnamese people.  That's not the point, Norton.  It is the point.  He is American.  You fight for it when an American goes.  Okay, so you.  Well, it isn't one's decision to make. 
[00:32:30]  This man does have a point.  He's trying to turn his back on the country.  I respect what he did.  I respect what he did because he took the consequences of it.  Do you understand?  Consequences, consequences.  A lot of them are rich.  He never helped his people.  If you don't see the consequences, he didn't go like all these politicians do.  That's one thing Jesse Ventura talks about that I really like is when he talks about all  these guys that took their Vietnam deferments and now they're in positions of power making  decisions about other people and they should have went to Vietnam and they didn't.  He took it like a man. 
[00:33:00]  He fucking had everything to lose.  What's that?  He's a coward.  He should make people in jail.  He's a coward.  What are you talking about?  They wouldn't not fight for the country.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  He's a coward.  You dummy.  I'm a coward.  He's not a coward, you dunce.  Bullshit.  Oh, yeah, I know.  You're brave and he was afraid.  Great point.  Yeah, the white man's war.  Yeah, he was.  You know what?  Okay. 
[00:33:30]  Maybe that's how he felt.  Maybe that's how he felt.  But he said that's how he felt and he fucking stood up for it.  I forgot how many people don't like Ali.  I think you have every right to hate Muhammad Ali, but you really can't call him a coward.  Dude, you can't call him a coward.  You're calling, again, you're saying that.  It's just silly.  He realized what he was going to lose by standing up for what he believed in.  And I'm not saying that I completely agree with it, but I respect him for, you know,  standing up for what he believed in.  In hindsight, he was right.  That's not the definition of a coward, sir. 
[00:34:00]  He turned his back on a country.  Yeah, I get all that, but you can't call him a coward for doing that.  Maybe he also felt.  Maybe he also felt that he.  The white man's war.  The white man's war.  You know what?  Maybe he also felt that he won a fucking Olympic medal for a country that wouldn't let him  eat in certain restaurants.  Why did he call a guy in jail, then?  They sure threw him in jail.  Well, again, maybe he fought and won an Olympic medal for a country that wasn't allowing  him to eat in certain diners.  And then he threw his Olympic medal in the fucking, in the Hudson River, I think.  He doesn't even have it anymore. 
[00:34:30]  He threw it out.  Doesn't that shit?  The guy turned his back.  He's a coward.  All right, well, I'm sure you're a lot braver than Ali.  You're a cunt, too.  And I hope a fucking tornado blows a fucking car through your living room, shithead.  Shouldn't your cell phone be getting whipped out of your hand right now by a strong wind?  Let's get it started.  Hold on, what's that brave boy?  I'm sorry, what'd you say, brave guy?  I'm not a coward.  I didn't say you were a coward.  I just hope a fucking tornado blows a car into your head.  I'm not saying you're a coward. 
[00:35:00]  I almost did.  Good, good.  Boom for the tornado from missing.  Better luck next time.  Frankus, Frankus, Frankus.  All right, Jim.  Listen, douchebag.  People have to understand.  People have to understand.  Ali wasn't a coward.  You don't have to agree with what he did, but it was pretty fucking brave what he did at the time.  Because you do make the good point, Jimmy.  I want to say that again.  If he did go into the service, he wasn't going to see any fucking action.  It was not an ounce of action like Elvis didn't.  It was a known fact that celebrities and family members of politicians and whatnot, they got taken care of. 
[00:35:30]  And he knew he would have had it nice and cushy if you went in, but chose not to.  And he fucking...  That's not a cowardly move.  You can hate him for it, certainly.  How does anybody go out and win an Olympic medal for the country and then get treated?  It's like black soldiers I was always amazed with, like in World War II or whatever.  Right.  These guys came back and they couldn't eat in fucking half the places that white people could eat in.  And they were sent overseas to fight. 
[00:36:00]  Like, what a shit country.  Why would you want to go and fight for that double standard?  What year did Ali win the Olympics?  1960?  Might have been 1960?  60, I'm going to say?  Might have been 60.  If it was 60, especially.  Fuck.  Yeah.  He still had a few years of hoses and shepherds.  Yeah, so he was supposed to go over and fight.  And meanwhile, they were fucking...  They were fighting black students into fucking colleges at that point.  My point?  You don't have to agree with what Ali did, certainly.  But don't...  I mean, I don't think that's the definition of a coward. 
[00:36:30]  No, it's silly.  I really don't.  The easy move would have been to just put it...  You know, go in and just keep his mouth shut and just fucking do his time and just wander around bases, like you said.  Like Dorothy, who just called in, you know, in the tornado.  I didn't mind him.  I just...  I didn't agree with what he said.  But when he called him a coward, I found, like, eh, you're just being phony.  Yeah, I don't...  You don't have to like him as a veteran.  I don't agree with that.  My racism stands in the way of having a logical opinion.  So, I just sit here.  Ali? 
[00:37:00]  Oh, come on.  Eh, I don't know.  Oh, I'm fucking kidding.  Come on.  All right, we got a guy that was at the Marlins Stadium.  What is the Marlins Stadium called?  What bank is it named after?  It's gotta be.  I fucking hate they do this.  It's terrible.  These stadiums used to have cool names, and now it's like...  Marlins Field.  Del Belca Vista Stadium?  Phase Two.  Phase Two?  What is it called?  Seinfeld?  What is it called? 
[00:37:30]  Marlins Park.  That means they don't have a sponsor yet for their stadium.  Oh, wow.  They're not gonna give up that money.  They will.  They'll have a sponsor eventually.  This was a tough stadium to get.  They had to fight really hard to get.  Tooth and nail.  Yes, tooth and nail, Jim.  How the fuck are they gonna, you know, keep baseball alive down there?  People just aren't interested.  It's like football in L.A.  Let it go.  Nobody gives a fuck about baseball there.  It's not a baseball area.  Football in L.A. could work.  Dude, they've lost teams.  They never... 
[00:38:00]  Lost teams twice.  Twice.  I know.  They should never get another fucking NFL team.  They're trying.  How do you not enjoy football in L.A.?  I know a lot of the transplants, I think.  But what the fuck?  Eric, you were at the opening night?  Yeah, I was.  It was great.  Thank you, Eric.  There's all the energy that they get in that stadium right there.  But you wanted to call our show.  That's all you want to say?  It was great.  But it was...  Ali just took us by...  There was this huge Jumbotron, which is HD, and it just took everyone by surprise. 
[00:38:30]  I mean, I'm a huge Ali fan.  Those other callers don't take callers from Texas and Little Rock.  They're fucking...  Nah, I don't mind taking calls from where I think...  Did you think they had the image stabilization off on the Jumbotron?  He's like...  He's a shell.  He's on his way out, man.  It was terrible.  You could hear it in his voice.  I mean, I think everyone just took their breath away.  Like, holy fuck.  Yeah, I think if he wanted to, he could probably shake it off, you know? 
[00:39:00]  Oh, wait.  But yeah, he is probably close to death.  He's not looking good at all.  But it's like we forget that...  All right, what's the option?  It's being dead.  Right.  L'Oreal was holding one arm, and the other arm was, like, shake.  I mean, he was excited and everything.  You could tell, but...  Yeah.  I mean, and it took him, like, ten minutes to get him out there.  But are we that uncomfortable with our own fucking mortality?  Like, are we that...  Of course.  Do we need to be sheltered that much from what happens when you get old?  Well, then we're fucking done. 
[00:39:30]  Not you, funny man, but a lot of people...  I think it'd be funny if the owner put, like, a V8 in his hand, and then just took it  back out and opened it and started drinking it.  Another guy puts a spray paint can in there, starts spraying the lines on the field.  Your penis, of course.  My dick.  But, uh...  It annoys me that people are that fucking...  It's almost like, what, if you're injured in the war?  Like, if you're burned in the war, you should never come out and be... 
[00:40:00]  Do you know what, because it's an injury?  Like, we're uncomfortable looking at it?  He's got Parkinson's, it blows!  Can you please take that clip out of context and play it?  Yeah.  Make Jimmy sound horrible?  Yeah.  I just think nothing about this made any sense.  Like, he can't throw a baseball.  Why do you have him out there to throw the first pitch?  I don't know why.  Like, it just seems...  That's sort of almost mocking it, the whole thing.  Yeah, it really does.  The guy had to pull the ball out of his hand.  He didn't...  Ali didn't even hand over the ball, because he didn't know what the fuck he was doing.  People, they're just paying tribute to him. 
[00:40:30]  I mean, it's like when Pryor was really sick and on his way out, they just paid tribute  to him.  Jimmy, I think the problem I have with this, it's opening day for a Marlins game, Ali.  I understand paying tribute to the guy, but in this way, I think it's a scumbag move  by his people and his family, I think.  Who's going to come out?  Charles Johnson, or the catcher from a few years ago?  Who else is going to come out?  But a Marlins game, they could find somebody.  Ah, first pitchers stink.  I hate the first pitchers.  There's a better way to pay respect for the guy.  Gloria Estefan.  Exactly. 
[00:41:00]  Bring her out to throw the ball.  You want the mayor to come out?  Fucking, you know, the mayor of Miami.  I think it's a big get, of course, for the organization, but I think it just shouldn't  have been done by his people.  Yeah, I think they figured out.  Frank would have been better.  Frank would have been better.  I think they figured out who the biggest celebrity was that had a tie to Miami, and they got him.  But I don't think it was the right decision.  I don't think so.  Well, if his family was comfortable with it.  Yeah, but they look like they just enjoy the limelight through him.  Yeah, but how many families of aging celebrities, you know, do shit for selfish reasons? 
[00:41:30]  Ali's wife is not, she's married to the biggest boxer of all time, but she's not exactly some  fucking chick that just kind of hooked up with a famous guy recently.  She's been with him for years.  Then she should throw out the first pitch.  Then she should have the good sense to know that there's something not right here.  Well, maybe she wants people to see him like that.  Maybe he wants to be seen like that.  This is what it is.  This is what Parkinson's is.  I know there's a charity that they're involved with.  Oh, maybe it helps.  For people to see it.  Like, you know, it should be out there. 
[00:42:00]  Let people see it.  I mean, I don't know.  We're not going to have Ali for too much longer.  No, it's depressing.  It's fucking miserable.  All right.  Nate is a douche.  Ali had balls inside and outside.  Sorry, Nate knows that.  It's just to get his other fucking inside and outside.  Silly.  Oh, why don't you ask Irock why they are such dicks down there?  Of course Irock is from Miami.  Born and bred.  Are you from Miami or West Palm Beach?  I always forget.  Where was it, Irock?  I'm from Long Island.  What?  It's West Palm.  Where is that?  Is that right on the coast?  He went to high school in West Palm Beach? 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  Commuting with his speedboat?  Yeah.  Yes, he did.  Pretty cool, huh?  Nice.  Yeah, but it was right from his backyard is where he parked the boat, and then he would just  take it right to school.  What a great life you had down there.  Oh, man.  Florida, Irock.  Spoiled brat.  I don't know why you would have ever...  You think Irock was spoiled growing up?  Oh, yeah, he was.  What a spoiled little boy.  Of course.  Gets his big piece of cake whenever he wanted it.  It's not even my birthday.  I'll be able to do the push-up.  His mom never...  Here it goes.  His mom never said no to candy ever.  I thought we were going to make it to the first break, Irock. 
[00:43:00]  I'm sorry.  Hey, we got to get some peeps in the studio tomorrow.  I want every fucking color, too.  Okay.  I am a traditionalist.  Yellow fucking peeps.  Yellow peeps rant.  Don't fuck with me with blue peeps.  Let's get some peeps going.  Okay.  Don't fuck with you and black peeps.  Don't make a maniac out of me.  You have black peeps.  Oh, boy.  You know, Monday, they're all going to be 90% off.  I forgot.  Yeah, that's true.  But then they're also a little stale.  I don't like that.  Oh, boy.  They get stale, like, within an hour.  Some people like them when they left out in a little... 
[00:43:30]  No!  They're fresh peep!  My mom used to put open peeps on the microwave, like, on the top of the microwave, and just  let them go stale.  Oh, man.  And then eat them a week later.  Of course, because she was ready to leave with a Jewish guy.  Yes, God.  I knew you'd turn it into something.  Your mom would let peeps go stale?  Yeah, and she loved it.  What an asshole.  Easter schmeester, she said.  Where's the Passover?  She purposely let them go stale.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Isn't it funny?  She passed over her family and went to some other guy?  That makes me laugh.  You think that's funny? 
[00:44:00]  Hilarious.  Aw.  Yeah.  You know what?  Tony in Brooklyn, it should be said, Marlins won two championships.  I was trying to remember that.  I know they won the one in their 20-year existence, and no one gives a shit.  97 in 2003.  And they still don't come out to games.  And then what was the one year where they were so stupid they traded the whole team in  the offseason?  Well, they got, I mean, they completely dismantled the team after they won in 97.  That is the dumbest thing ever.  Way the fuck in the year.  So the next year, people couldn't even go to the stadium to see the players that won the 
[00:44:30]  fucking World Series.  Yeah.  They completely dismantled, right?  Florida's not a baseball state.  It's just dumb.  And LA's not a football town, so just fucking take the teams.  Why do they have teams?  Those Marlins fans were fucking...  Money.  By the way, there's that lack of passion.  That's why bringing him there was a mistake.  They should have brought him out in New York.  Not fucking the Marlins game.  Now you're talking, and it goes back to my point.  Why the Marlins and their new stadium?  If you bring them to New York to open up baseball in general, or even down there in Washington 
[00:45:00]  or something, I don't know.  There's better markets.  They should have just driven him around the...  Every stadium?  No, we're just driven...  Yeah, in the parking lot.  Just sleeping in a lot.  You're waving him on the way in.  He could shake your martini for you.  Oh, man.  Yeah, poor guy.  Well, what do you want from me?  All right, let's go to Adam in Kansas City, man.  These guys, we get that he was a draft dodger, and you should hate him for that.  No, he shouldn't.  He fucking gave up... 
[00:45:30]  Well, they have the right to hate him for it.  They do.  They do.  But then they fucking still...  I'm sure that they still don't hate politicians who's fucking just used political connections  to not go either.  Let's go, Adam.  What do you got?  You're the last call on this subject.  Make it good.  Yeah, he kind of passed up the subject a little bit, but I kind of agree with Jimmy.  I just wanted to ask him what his opinion would be if we had a new situation in today's...  You know, we have a similar war going on in the Middle East that people don't agree with,  but hypothetically, not that it would ever happen, but if we had another draft and they 
[00:46:00]  had like an Aaron Rodgers or a Mike Vick decided they didn't want to go to that because they  didn't believe in it.  You know, it's hard to say, man.  It's a good question because, again, the draft...  Excuse me.  The draft is the fucking big X factor.  I mean, we don't have a draft.  It's really difficult to say.  How would I feel about Aaron Rodgers or any of those guys not going?  I might be annoyed with it.  I might be annoyed with it.  Oh, the country would hate him.  Yeah, I'm sure the country would hate him. 
[00:46:30]  The majority of the country would hate if a celebrity did this.  The reason Ali was...  And they hated Ali, but that, once again, that's what made it amazing.  He turned everyone's...  Not everyone, but a lot of people's opinions around by the end of his career.  It was the timing of when he did it.  It was the implications.  It was the focus that brought on racism in this country.  At this point, if two athletes at the Olympics held up their fists in a black power salute,  it wouldn't mean anything.  But when they did it then, it meant a lot.  So, you know what I mean?  It's the time of it.  Times are different, too, right?  Yeah.  Times are much different. 
[00:47:00]  I do see something like what Pat Tillman did as being very brave.  Absolutely.  You know, the guy gave up his career to serve in the military and was killed.  By a friendly fire, I think.  Yeah, yeah, it was.  That, to me, is unbelievably brave and selfless.  Yeah, absolutely.  I think above...  My opinion, above and beyond what Ali did.  Ali did a very brave thing for his beliefs and for what the country was at the time.  But I think when you sacrifice a million-dollar contract to put it all on the line like that, 
[00:47:30]  literally, your life on the line, I think that holds more weight than somebody, you know, standing up for...  Well, then you can say that about any soldier.  Like, any soldier that has volunteered and fought...  Oh, absolutely.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  But I'm talking about it is above and beyond.  If you're working at a fucking chicken farm down south and you go to war, it's a little different than you're handed a huge football contract that you say no to go off and serve. 
[00:48:00]  That, to me, is un-fucking-believably selfless.  Absolutely.  Ali, I think, obviously had some kind of...  There is a personal agenda.  Yes.  ...that he had at the time.  Very brave personally and morally, but not so much physically.  I mean, to put literally your life on the line like that.  But he wouldn't have been putting his life on the line.  That's why it had nothing to do with that, because Ali never would have seen action. 
[00:48:30]  They never...  Especially back then, they just...  Pat Tillman fought.  Yeah, right, right.  Ali could have went in and never seen action, and believe me, he knew that.  That's why people who are saying coward, the word is being thrown around, but he wouldn't have fucking seen...  He would have been considered...  He probably would have done a lot better financially, because people who hated him would have loved him.  People who loved him still would have loved him.  He would have done nothing, but it would have been a complete win for him.  I think that he's the complete farthest away from a coward. 
[00:49:00]  Anybody that would call him a coward is...  It's just silly.  ...on a certain level of ignorance that I can't explain.  But the only disagreement I have is that there's thousands of people that disagreed with the war that didn't want to go, that just didn't have the level of fame, that just got overlooked.  Right.  Not that it's okay, but, you know, that's the only disagreement I have with him.  I appreciate you guys having...  All right, yeah, yeah.  I mean, you could...  Of course you do.  You could hate if you want, but, I mean, it's tough to call him a coward also.  Because he didn't lie about it.  He said that this is why he's not going, and he just refused to... 
[00:49:30]  Right.  ...whatever it was he refused to do.  And he gave up everything with no guarantee he was going to get it back.  With no guarantee that he was going to be able to fight again.  Or no guarantee that he wasn't going to go to jail.  And back then, fighting was everything for him.  Everything to him.  Yeah.  Why don't we take a break?  I can't believe I've actually had to sell the idea that Ali was a fucking great American to people.  I can't believe people are that fucking stupid.  I can't comprehend that people are that stupid.  He brought up a lot of awareness in his life.  Of course he did.  I think he's 70 years old now, by the way. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, he's not even changed.  70 these days is not that old, man.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, well...  He's not going to make it too much longer.  Shatner comes in here.  He's 82.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sharp as a tack, too.  And he's been through a lot of stuff, Shatner.  I mean, fighting the Gorn.  I know.  That was very...  That would take a few years off your life right there.  Jesus.  Locked up like a thrall from the gamesters of Triskelion.  And enslaved like that.  How many times he's had electrodes on his neck and punched in the face and phases and... 
[00:50:30]  Oh, God.  Someone wants to know, Jimmy, why you think your opinion is correct.  Well, it's the same reason anybody thinks their opinion is correct.  Thank you.  Because it's my opinion.  When you have an opinion, you just feel that way.  And you wish others felt that way.  Yeah.  I don't...  That's just how it works.  I'm not unaware of why somebody who was in the military wouldn't be annoyed at somebody  who didn't go and fight.  Yeah.  But the guys you should be annoyed at are the ones that use political connections and 
[00:51:00]  stuff.  Not the guys that stood up and took the fucking hit and just said, do what you're going to  do.  I'm not going.  Right.  Is there a fire?  No.  That happens every day.  What is it?  It's the testing of the system.  That happens every day?  I've never heard this.  I've never heard this.  The doors open or crack.  You sure?  Oh, yeah.  Roland.  Roland.  All right.  We're going to go to break.  Roland was at Springsteen.  The door was great.  We'll see what was different about last night's Springsteen show than the one he went to  two nights ago.  Now it's a sickness.  You're obsessed. 
[00:51:30]  He's hoarding Springsteen shows.  You're obsessed.  He just hoards them.  Yes.  Roland.  And also, we got a video we want to discuss next.  The audio of the video is terrific, so don't worry.  You don't officially need the visual element after the break.  Thanks, though.  We'll explain next.  The O.P.  Anthony Show.  On Sirius XM.  Coming up on the next Butt Trek, the USS Prolapse continues its journey through the universe  in search of giant cocks to fuck. 
[00:52:00]  But the crew members soon find themselves in a compromising position.  Oh, my.  Why is there nothing between their legs?  It's silly.  There should be something there.  Why would these people be walking around?  They must be alien race.  Mr. Chekhov is unclipped.  I noticed that at the urinal.  I sure would like to suck it.  Join our heroes as they unravel the mystery of this strange new life form.  They all seem to be lacking something that I enjoy.  Cocks.  And struggle with the dangers of traveling through the universe. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, tell me!  There's a gerbil suck in my hiding.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Where did your cock go?  Discover the fate of our fearless heroes.  All on the next Butt Trek.  Power off the ships, Captain!  I'd like a dick in my backside!  Nobody is supposed to touch your private parts.  Don't touch me like that.  Don't touch me like that.  No!  Nobody is supposed to touch your private parts.  You know I really like you, but I don't like the way you touch me. 
[00:53:00]  Touch me.  No!  Touch me.  Stop it!  Stop it!  Touch me.  Touch me.  No!  No!  Do you ever hear anything like this?  This, this, this, this, this?  Anus.  A-a-a-a-a-a.  Anus.  Is a useful thing indeed.  We all have an anus.  All have an anus.  Remember that anus. 
[00:53:30]  Is the proper word.  Anus.  A-a-a-a.  Anus.  Gives relief in time of me.  We all have an anus, all have an anus, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, 
[00:54:00]  Here's what boys have down in front.  Penis.  Most people call it vagina.  Some children call it Virginia.  Nobody is supposed to touch your private parts.  Nobody is supposed to touch your private parts. 
[00:54:30]  To touch your private parts.  Nobody is a, nobody is a, nobody is a, nobody is a, nobody is a, nobody is a private parts.  No.  Stop.  If you don't, I'm going to tell my dad.  Touch it.  No.  Touch it, touch it. 
[00:55:00]  Stop it, stop it.  Touch it.  No.  Touch it, touch it.  Period.  Nobody is supposed to touch your private parts.  Series X.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  That's why I say, hey man, I shine.  Good shine, man. 
[00:55:30]  That's why I say, hey man, I shine.  Good shine, man.  Get in topical.  Hold up.  Wait a minute.  With the sex man.  Morning, sexy.  Hi.  You're not even trying, huh?  We're not playing Clue here.  This is your bit. 
[00:56:00]  This is your bit.  Wow.  We finally got a bit for you and you don't want to go with it.  Why wouldn't you make it a little more challenging?  Doesn't it need to be so deep?  And make people think.  When Bob Buckman used to do the Q with a D.  The Q with a D.  He would rope you in and you'd go, fuck, I need to know what the Q with a D is now.  Had energy behind it.  What was he giving away with it?  Well, it was just a clue in how he did it.  It could have went a bunch of ways and you had to kind of like decipher and do some figuring out. 
[00:56:30]  So model myself after Bob Buckman.  Gotcha.  I don't know really, but hey man, nice shot for Kurt Cobain.  Seriously?  Should I have played a Nirvana song?  I don't know what you should have done.  I don't.  I'm trying to think.  Okay.  What should he have done for Kurt Cobain?  Nothing.  Just been respectful.  18 years ago, by the way.  18 years.  18 years ago.  Kurt Cobain.  Blammo.  Yeah. 
[00:57:00]  What if it's a Kareem Abdul-Jabbar song?  What?  Maybe he played it for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  Oh, nice shot.  Right.  Oh.  Oh.  See then.  That's what I would have done.  See, Iraq, you could have faced me and said, hey, asshole, I was doing it for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  He's not on that level.  Rihanna refuses to apologize for reuniting with Chris Brown.  Nice shot.  Oh, shit.  So maybe Iraq is brilliant.  This covers three topics today.  Travis and I are brilliant.  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar became the highest scoring player in NBA history 28 years ago today. 
[00:57:30]  So, yeah.  Hey, man, nice shot for Kareem, for Kurt, and Rihanna.  Fuck, Iraq.  You're brilliant.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  He rocked in the heavy who.  Sex up.  Sex back up.  Whitney Houston.  More coming out about Whitney Houston.  Here's what you need to know.  They already told us what she died of, right?  Yeah.  A couple weeks ago.  Well, now it came out that they found her face down in the bathtub. 
[00:58:00]  Whoops.  That's not a good way to bathe.  And this is horrific.  The temperature was extremely hot.  When they found her five hours later, the bathtub water was still at 93 or 95 degrees.  That's after five hours of fucking cooling down.  Wasn't there water dribbling in, though?  Like, did she...  She might have had...  Like, you know, you're in a tub and you leave a little hot water running.  I wonder if she had that going.  Uh, I think that is a possibility, Jimmy, because, uh...  Five hours.  Fuck.  Because there was a little...  A bit of a flood, too. 
[00:58:30]  How long a bath did she normally take that people didn't notice she's in the fucking tub for five hours?  They said five hours.  But then I read the article and an assistant came back like an hour later and found her.  After she said, go take a bath.  So I'm not sure.  Maybe I read that wrong.  But the temperature of the water was certainly very hot.  Yikes.  Face down.  Hot water, huh?  Some, uh...  Sounds like murder.  A mirror with some, uh, white powder on it they found.  Open beer.  What else?  A couple of...  Beer?  Yeah, you know, just a beer. 
[00:59:00]  Just a beer.  Damn.  I would assume if you're doing a lot of drugs, the beer is, uh...  Beer's good.  Takes the ad hoc.  An accessory.  And wash it down.  To wash these drugs down with...  Worship.  What else?  Uh...  Uh...  The official finding, according to Fox News Channel, revealed that Houston's body was discovered  by her assistant in the bathtub, which had 12 to 13 inches of water in it.  What?  So that's not a lot of water.  A foot of water's a lot, though.  Oh, the tub had that much.  Yeah.  Oh, are they even...  That's not a lot. 
[00:59:30]  A foot of water.  Oh, you thought the whole...  Yeah, I was like, Jesus Christ.  That's a lot of water.  White powdery substance nearby.  Cigarette butts.  Mr. Bubble.  An ashtray.  Mr. Bubble.  Small spoon with a white crystal-like substance in it.  And rolled up white piece of paper.  Damn.  And other things.  A plethora of prescription medication bottles.  Jesus.  Plethora?  Now they're calling it a plethora.  So...  Can I have a plethora of drugs, please? 
[01:00:00]  Plethora.  A plethora.  Well...  Oh, we're supposed to play that video.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  This is a...  This is the latest viral video, I guess.  Jimmy Kimmel.  Yeah, we don't have a visual element.  But I did tweet it.  And I gave credit to Jimmy Kimmel.  Another Kimmel viral video.  Like, Kimmel's a smart dude, man.  They're really smart with the fucking web.  They can find some shit over there, man.  Yeah.  They're the smartest of all the late night shows.  Yep.  Of all of them with hitting this, uh, this, uh, whatever you want to say, this genre. 
[01:00:30]  What am I saying?  Yeah, this whole medium.  Medium.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck yeah.  The whole world will be, uh, watching this today.  Well, it's, it's, uh, another one of these things.  Remember that kid, what was his name?  That, uh, had, uh, had his little dental, uh, he had his...  Is this real life?  David.  Oh, David!  Little David.  Oh, he was so drugged out.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Oh, David!  Oh, David!  Oh, is this real life?  Is this real life?  Whoa!  I don't know why I feel this way. 
[01:01:00]  My heart's funny.  I don't know.  He's a drugged out.  This guy.  Is this real life?  Why is this happening to me?  Is this going to be forever?  What you don't, you don't, what you don't realize, that, that went viral.  We realized that part.  It's, uh, 28 years old today.  28 years old.  Yeah.  What ends up happening, though, it, it gives everyone else an idea.  Like, oh, fuck, I'm going to start taping when I'm under.  Or when my friend is under, whatever.  Well, this is a, uh, a mother that taped the daughter. 
[01:01:30]  Right.  Uh, after she had her wisdom teeth pulled.  And I'm sure they gave her some fucking liquid Valium or some shit.  Because she is fucked up.  Now, she looks like a high school kid, you know, maybe, uh, maybe a, uh, sophomore, maybe a freshman.  Mm-hmm.  I don't know.  Uh, and she's very nerdy looking.  Very geeky looking.  Not quite a looker.  She's sort of going through the awkward years, isn't she?  She's got to be, what, 15 maybe?  Yeah.  And she just looks like she probably doesn't do many drugs in her life. 
[01:02:00]  She's a dork.  And, yeah.  Harry Potter.  She's quite a dork.  Yeah.  Uh, so when she's fucked up, I don't think she's used to this.  No.  She definitely doesn't know how to keep it cool in front of the parents.  Yo, keep it cool.  Uh, yeah.  Be cool.  Oh, fucking parents are awake.  Dude, when you come in the house, fucking be cool.  You're so high.  Where's the visine?  Holy shit, your eyes are fucking red.  You reek.  That's what it was like every night coming home.  Uh, yeah. 
[01:02:30]  So she's all fucked up.  She's on the drugs.  They pick this up, I guess, as she's leaving the dentist's chair and has to get into a wheelchair.  Because they got a wheel out of the car and then it continues in the car.  You think her bra was a bit off?  Oh, what do you mean?  The dentist might have done something?  Well, I said a bit off, but, you know, askew.  Yeah, yeah, askew.  Like, it didn't feel quite right.  Oh, no.  Oh, it doesn't, yeah.  What?  It's not.  When she was going back into the waiting room to see mom.  Why's my t-shirt, like, a little, it doesn't feel like I put it on like this. 
[01:03:00]  I didn't put it on.  It's just a little off.  God, if I was a dentist, I would so be doing that.  Oh, man.  How do you not?  Oh, sorry.  Oh.  That was my inner voice.  Right.  But how do you not, like, just open a button?  Yeah.  Just take a peek.  And you can move, and I figured out you can move that, you can move that chair all the  way forward so they even fall forward a little bit so you get a peek that way.  Oh, man.  You're just readjusting the chair so you can see down her shirt. 
[01:03:30]  So there's no fingerprints?  Yeah, that would work.  How do you not do that?  Oh, man.  God bless you, dentists, for not going with that.  Some of them do.  They sure do.  Herb switch goes off and it's over.  Well, at this point, there's new rules.  You have to have an assistant.  New rules.  When you're doing some of this stuff?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's got to be, uh, some broad's got to be in the room with you.  Right.  Hygienist.  All right.  Here we go.  Yeah, this, here's the girl.  She's got cotton in her mouth. 
[01:04:00]  Check this out.  You get in a wheelchair.  Here comes your wheelchair.  Oh, f***.  Clapping.  What a dork.  Clapping for a wheelchair.  We're bringing in our little wheelchair.  Okay?  All right.  You have to stand up straight and you have to look where you're going when you get in  the wheelchair, okay?  Oh, no.  You ready?  I'm going to go.  I need to just slide.  Go ahead.  Can you just play for me?  What a dork she is, man.  She's not cool.  No, she's not cool.  She's not one of the cool kids.  No way.  There we go. 
[01:04:30]  And get in the wheelchair.  All right.  They're putting her in the wheelchair.  There you go.  And then they fast-forward to her.  Her head's all the way back.  Yeah, her head just went completely back.  They're going to fast-forward to her in the car with her mom.  That's when this gets really good.  She's smart.  Oh, no.  What a dork.  So not cool.  In the car.  She's punching at her mother.  What a dork.  You don't even want to know.  I mean, like, I am going. 
[01:05:00]  What's my mother's up with her?  You know what?  You're what?  Do you pause?  Do you know what this reminds me of?  This reminds me of being in a meeting with management.  Like, the way that you're both talking and it's just nothing's happening.  Exactly.  Told you that.  But when?  She said you're going?  Yeah, I was in college.  Yeah, she thought you were in college.  But we don't even live in America.  We don't live in America? 
[01:05:30]  No.  Where do we live?  I don't remember.  Where do we live?  Harrisburg.  Harrisburg.  North Carolina.  North Carolina.  What?  Hogwarts.  Hogwarts?  I'm a wizard.  You live in Hogwarts?  I'm a wizard.  You're a wizard?  Holy shit. 
[01:06:00]  I'm a wizard.  I'm a wizard.  I put a spell on me.  They put a spell on you?  Yes.  Oh my god.  What do we do?  We gotta get back.  What?  We gotta get revenge.  Revenge?  Holy shit.  How are we gonna do that?  I have my lightsaber. 
[01:06:30]  Lightsaber?  You can borrow this one.  I can borrow that one?  I hate it.  Now what do we do?  This kid doesn't know how to take her drugs.  We're gonna have to get a snack break.  A snack break?  I have spilled my mouth.  Yeah.  They put it in my mouth.  Right?  Oh, they put it in her mouth.  Oh man.  I know.  You had your wisdom teeth taken out. 
[01:07:00]  What the hell is that?  Okay, we gotta go get your medicine.  More medicine.  Oh!  I love this medicine.  I love that.  Bye.  She loves that medicine.  I bet you do.  The beginning of another drug addict.  Yeah, yeah.  These dentists and doctors just assume everyone can handle medication.  It's scary.  And that they're gonna get done with it and be like,  alright, well, I guess that was it.  And not go like, holy fuck, I wanna do that again. 
[01:07:30]  Right.  Where do I get more?  Ace app.  Fucking doctors have a big responsibility out there.  Yeah.  I don't think they realize that sometimes.  That, uh...  Oh, fuck.  Man.  She was fucking tooled.  That's pretty cruel of the mom, though, because you gotta figure, this girl's, what, 15?  She's in high school.  Uh, it's on the internet now.  She kinda, she's pretty fucking dorky.  So she probably gets made fun of anyway.  And now they're just gonna relentlessly bash this girl and make fun of her in school because of this. 
[01:08:00]  Cyberbullying?  Yeah, if they see some cyber mom is accused of, is guilty of cyberbullying.  Oh, no.  That's what I see.  Hey, um, E-Rock, I think Lane Staley, uh, died or they found his body 10 years ago today, too.  Same day?  I believe so, yeah.  I believe so.  Can we look that up?  Because, uh, I'm a huge, and I think Ant's a huge, Allison Chainsbury.  Oh, yes.  As well.  Yes, yes.  Hey, uh, Rick in Charlotte, what's up?  All right, so there's a dentist here.  Oh, uh, Opie, you mentioned how dentists have to have somebody else in the room. 
[01:08:30]  I've never heard you guys talk about this, a dentist here in Charlotte that got caught  shooting his own cum into his female patient's mouth.  Have you guys ever talked about this?  Why the...  Oh, boy.  That's when it gets creepy.  Yeah.  I mean, to go for, you know, cop a feel, maybe, or undo a button or two, but shoot your own  cum in her mouth.  Shooting cum in the mouth?  I disagree.  I think he was shooting high, no pun intended, but here's a little background on that.  He got caught because some female patients who knew the taste of cum, one literally said 
[01:09:00]  to him, I have to give you this shot, and she said, oh, that tastes like sperm.  Right, right.  And he put it in the gun or whatever, the...  Yeah, yeah, he...  A syringe.  Oh, he didn't jerk.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was putting a syringe full of cum in their mouth.  What a scumbag.  Yeah.  And also, the way...  One of the ways they caught him is opiate.  What you said was his assistants noticed he kept sending them out of the room for random  stuff. 
[01:09:30]  Oh.  And so the cops did a sting, and when they went in on him, he reached his pocket.  He was carrying syringes at all times, so he was ready.  When they busted him, he had syringes in his pocket.  Syringes of cum in his mouth.  Do we have a picture of that guy?  What a piece of shit.  What a fucking power trip move that is.  Like, that's almost something that should be punishable by just being shot.  Yeah.  Like, you know, you fucking...  Because you just...  If a guy was just grabbing their tits, I get that.  I get that.  But injecting your cum in them, it's like you're just a fucking...  Yeah. 
[01:10:00]  Horrible.  You can't live in society.  Horrible.  And his excuse was that he was testing his sperm for, like, a sperm count.  He had some great story as to why he was carrying around a cum.  Well, at that point, you've got to come up with something.  Yeah, you can't just say, why do you have this deal?  I'm going to shoot it in the chick's mouth, officer.  Because I'm a creep and I want to shoot my sperm in their mouth.  No, you will come up with something.  Very true.  No, that's where they go, why do you have this...  Why do you have these needles of cum?  That's where you go, what? 
[01:10:30]  You know how you pause and think of something real quick?  Oh, like Sandusky did.  Yeah.  Needles of cum?  What do you mean?  Like that...  It's like the commercial.  It's like the commercial.  Give me one moment, please.  What?  We got the story, huh?  This guy ain't lying.  No, I do remember this story, yeah.  I'm lying.  Yeah.  The boys, punch it up.  All right, brother.  Yeah, that is just fucking heinous.  What an ass.  What an asshole.  Yeah.  By the way, so Lane Staley...  No one pays attention to Lane Staley anymore. 
[01:11:00]  It's unbelievable.  He died...  They think he died ten years ago today.  The creepy thing with him, they didn't find his body for two weeks.  Because he pretty much shut out everyone from his life, including his own family.  Some heavy decomposition right there, I bet you.  Yep.  So it took two weeks when they finally decided, maybe we should check on him.  And then, you know, they figured out that shit.  What do they put up?  Fucking caterpillar?  They...  You know how they do that shit?  Help me out.  What?  They study the bugs, and then they can figure out how dead... 
[01:11:30]  Oh, yeah, a lot of times it is entomology to see how long somebody's been dead.  But in his own place, yeah, they're probably looking at flies, at blowfly larvae.  Oh, Jesus.  The blowfly.  Jesus.  I don't know.  That's...  That's horrible.  Yeah.  I guess they look at the environment and, you know, kind of see what the decomposition is  and figure it out from there based on what other bodies have done.  But it had to be a wreck after that long. 
[01:12:00]  I was a huge Nirvana fan, but as time goes by, I like Alice in Chains much better than Nirvana.  Yeah.  Still love Nirvana, don't get me wrong, but, I mean, the Alice in Chains stuff still stays with me.  Yeah, yeah.  I still play Alice in Chains.  I like that shit.  I like that shit.  I don't know.  Tough guy?  I don't know.  So the Mega Millions winner.  We're following this story closely.  This McDonald's woman.  Right.  We got another update today. 
[01:12:30]  How does the story go?  She bought all the tickets for everybody at McDonald's, but then bought one separate one for herself.  So she says.  That's the winning ticket.  Everyone is pissed off.  They're trying to find this ticket.  She said she hid it in McDonald's.  I think that's where we were up to, right?  That's where we were.  I think that's a bunch of bunk.  Well, Mega Millions winner, Merlande Wilson's lawyer, is quoted in the headline of this story.  I cannot say with any certainty this ticket exists.  Her own lawyer?  Yes.  Is saying he can't say. 
[01:13:00]  He was probably excited first, and then he's realizing this whole fucking story is crumbling  around him.  We have audio of her?  We're for it.  Yeah.  We got the audio, so I don't have to read this shit.  A ticket stashed at McDonald's.  Is this the latest update, do you think, Sam?  I don't know if it's the latest one or I'm going to get to this.  Let's hope.  I don't think it is.  It says claims tickets in McDonald's.  She's hateable, isn't she, this chick?  I'm Megan Murphy for the Huffington Post.  Hi, Meg.  Call her McTree.  That McDonald's worker who claims she holds one of the Mega Millions tickets worth $105 million 
[01:13:30]  in cash.  A ticket co-workers say was part of a workplace pool.  37-year-old Merlande Wilson of Baltimore says the ticket is stashed away at work, but she  won't say where.  The New York Post gets in on the pun.  She is apparently not worried about the Hamburglar.  Another employee inspects Wilson's gold page from arch-rival Burger King and cooks up  a Whopper.  Wilson has to go at the $105 million in Maryland's lottery office.  She says she's going to lay low for a while, let people return to their senses.  But this Mega Millions mystery won't likely be solved soon or without the help of some surveillance. 
[01:14:00]  Here's CBS.  They say the purchase was captured on surveillance video, but that several people, women and men,  bought tickets around the same time.  And because Maryland doesn't require that lottery winners go public, the victor could  remain a mystery forever.  Wow.  Look at this.  They won't.  She's now saying she might not even claim that prize after all, to which the Fox and  Friends crew is incredulous.  I have to make my mind right now.  It's too much speculation. 
[01:14:30]  I'm all over the news.  I'm going to see my face.  She's a single mother of seven.  You would think she'd cash in the ticket quickly.  For $100 million, you can go to the lottery commission.  For the Huffington Post, I'm Megan.  That was a great clip of incredulous.  Incredulous.  Well, she should cash it.  I know.  They were outraged.  That was yesterday.  Today, the flaky McDonald's worker who claimed she had blah, blah, blah.  She called a huge press conference Wednesday, yesterday, and then arrived late only to tell  the press to leave. 
[01:15:00]  What?  She's a nut.  She's playing the media.  Her lawyer announced to the mystified journalist packed into the Baltimore Law Office that  the purpose of the press conference was to ask you all to go home.  And there's a shine on the floor.  You deserve a break.  I had that song stuck in my head all night.  Oh, right?  Yeah, the old 70s McDonald's commercial song.  Merlande Wilson of Maryland who said by co-workers to crave attention hit one jackpot, a chaotic 
[01:15:30]  scrum of reporters and camera crews walking to talk to her.  But she never spoke.  Asked if this was her plea for 15 minutes of fame.  She shook her head.  Her lawyer, Edward Smith, said, no, she doesn't want 15 minutes of fame.  Instead, he said, she would like you all to go home.  This needs to stop so she and her children can go back to a normal life, he said.  For the record, Smith says he hasn't seen the ticket either.  I cannot say with certainty this ticket exists.  So, she's just a fucking kook.  Yeah, she's fucking, she's batty. 
[01:16:00]  I don't know why they're even giving her any credibility whatsoever.  No, now they should just make fun of her.  Yeah, just call her out.  Say that she don't have it.  Yeah.  Adult.  Dummy.  To your point, Ant.  Yeah.  The fucked up teenager posted the video.  She did?  Yeah, she, I guess she said, oh, fuck, I didn't have my fame today.  Oh, see, I didn't know that.  It wasn't the mom.  I did not know that.  That's coming in. 
[01:16:30]  She wants to be a little famous.  I see.  Okay.  I knew that.  In other fast food news.  This is our fast food news segment.  Fast food news.  Yeah.  Do we have production?  Do we have production for this?  No, we're not.  Fuck.  Pulled Burger King commercial featuring Mary J. Blige singing about fried chicken wrap.  So, we have it.  What?  I guess Mary J. Blige said, yeah, I'll fucking sing about your chicken wraps for Burger King.  Nice payday for her.  Chicken wrap.  And then what happened?  Black people said, what the fuck are you doing, Mary J. Blige? 
[01:17:00]  You know we don't like when people point out we like chicken.  Yeah, like a bunch of...  Is that what happened?  Yeah.  So, Burger King is doing this, like, campaign where they've got celebrities in it and they  like...  It's for the new menu items, one of which is a fried chicken wrap.  And Mary J. Blige didn't like the fact that black people were eating chicken?  Well, Mary at first did.  She enjoys a chicken wrap, I suppose, because she started singing about it.  Oh, well.  So, this commercial came out on the internet and then a lot of black journalists were 
[01:17:30]  saying, you know, Mary J. Blige is a respected member of the community, blah, blah, blah.  I can't believe she was doing this.  And that's where black people need to fucking cut this shit.  Shut the fuck up.  She's advertising a product, which it's fair for fucking blacks to like and whites to like  it.  So, what is she singing about it?  She's not...  She's a black singer, so she's advertising for a product.  Yeah.  Torre said it was jarring.  What?  Torre's a douchebag.  Who?  That fucking asshole.  What's he on MSNBC?  Oh, is he the one that went at it with Piers Morgan recently?  Yeah, and he lost.  Piers smashed him.  I didn't hear that clip either. 
[01:18:00]  He's a douche.  The one of him going at it with Piers.  We should play that clip.  I'm surprised we haven't yet.  Oh, this guy?  Yeah, he's hateable.  What's wrong with black people liking chicken?  Where does that come from?  I'm very confused by that one.  I don't know where the stereotype comes from.  Probably years ago, it just was what they ate.  What's wrong with that?  And it's true to this day when...  I remember one time I decided to take the local roads home from Nassau Coliseum, which  was really stupid to me.  Uniondale.  It was amazing how many chicken joints I saw.  It was amazing to me. 
[01:18:30]  You will find a lot of fried chicken places in a lot of predominantly black communities.  Absolutely.  So what's wrong with that?  Does anyone know for real?  I don't know what is wrong with that.  When I worked at Pergament, New Brunswick Lake, George Street was kind of a rough area.  So for lunch one day, I went down there with one of the black guys I worked with named Brian.  And he was a bald guy.  He was like a shit talker, like an angry black dude.  And all I remember about being in this chicken place, I was the only white guy, and he got  into an argument with somebody. 
[01:19:00]  And as we walked out, he yelled, and you better have a pistol.  That's all I remember.  Oh, really?  They got my guy I was with yelling at somebody else.  We went back to Pergament.  His nickname was Hook.  So it went out with a tough crowd there, Jimmy.  It was just co-workers.  I was the token fucking cab getter.  So once everybody started saying, you know, what are you doing, Mary?  This is not good, blah, blah, blah.  Then Mary said that she had not approved that version of the commercial that came out.  So Burger King pulled it off their website and their YouTube, citing that it had not been 
[01:19:30]  properly licensed.  So they didn't say this is bad racially, blah, blah, blah.  They just said Mary didn't approve this version, so we're taking it down.  It was a fuck.  But you know why?  Let's hear the version.  This has to be awful.  Let's see.  Right now, exciting things are happening at Burger King.  Welcome to Burger King.  Oh, what's in those new chicken snack wraps?  What's in the new chicken snack wraps?  I don't want to watch it.  Mary?  Everybody want to do some ice cream.  Let me ride it.  Wait, now.  Let me ride it. 
[01:20:00]  Let me ride it.  Oh, okay.  I am outraged then.  Oh, that is how you all rage is.  I like it.  You hear me?  You hear me?  You hear me?  You hear me?  Here's the real version.  Sorry for that.  The new chicken snack wraps. 
[01:20:30]  Come and get it at Burger King.  I don't know what the big deal is.  I don't know.  What version is she like?  Why?  Did Martin Luther King give his life?  That's an outrage.  This takes civil rights back 50 years.  But why would that be objectionable?  There was a good old white people in the line.  Obviously.  Is that chicken about question?  Wait.  Chicken?  If you can't see it, racist, Jim.  I don't get it.  The purpose of the commercial is obviously just to be like silly.  Like it just, you wouldn't think that.  But people described it as buffoonery. 
[01:21:00]  And when the word buffoonery is used to.  Oh.  But it's not buffoonery.  Step and fetch it.  Right.  Uncle Tom.  Because she was singing about a product.  She was singing about flour and tortillas.  It wasn't like she was jumping up and down on the fucking counter going, I love chicken.  Right.  She was on a stage singing.  Singing about tortillas.  The song sucks.  How do you try to sing about tortillas?  It's a terrible song.  It's awful.  But it's like supposed to be bad, I think.  You know what I mean?  Right.  It's kind of a goof, right?  Right.  It's just a goof.  Yeah.  It's a goof.  Why would they?  They're not seriously putting her up there with lights singing about tortillas. 
[01:21:30]  But I mean, yeah.  When respected black people or black artists are accused of buffoonery, that's one of those  words.  Kowtow to the man.  Buffoonery.  Oh, shit.  I hear you.  And she's such a fucking weakling.  She should have come out and said, fuck you.  Fuck you.  Shut the fuck up my payday, motherfucker.  Don't fuck with my money.  Fuck with my shit.  You got the clip of that guy that started it.  What's his name again?  Traon?  Torrey.  Torrey.  He's a Traon.  This is the Joe.  I have to say it again.  This is the guy that started the whole thing. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  He gets very involved with black issues.  It's coming in.  That chicken used to be way cheaper than beef.  Yeah.  If I was a Negro, I would own that shit.  Like, look how smart we are.  Well, it's not so much.  You don't saw chicken was cheap, but look how delicious it is.  It's not so much for being smart.  It's the fact that the plantation owners and whatnot did not want to spend good money and  resources on the slaves.  So they would feed them cheaper food, of which would be chicken, which was actually the 
[01:22:30]  good part of the cheap food.  Other parts would be like pig knuckles and bellies and stuff.  And they call that.  And they came to soft food, right?  Yeah.  They call that low on the hog.  Yeah.  As opposed to living high on the hog, which is the good meat that was up high on the  hog and not low.  Is that what that means?  Yes.  Living high on the hog.  Oh, fuck.  And then living like low on the hog was all the crappy.  But the joke is on the masa because it tastes delicious.  I don't know about pig's feet.  I ain't eating that shit.  Pickle pig's feet?  That's the name I first banned in high school.  No, I didn't read it on Knicker Mania. 
[01:23:00]  So you people are out of your minds.  That actually sounds like a legitimate issue.  I learned history from a cooking show.  Why are they out of their minds?  They're just following your lead.  They just assume.  They just assume.  I look at every type of website.  Why should I only look at websites that are deemed inoffensive?  I look at offensive websites, garner information as to what some people's opinions and thoughts  and horrific racism are.  And then I go to other websites that counter that with their own horrific racism. 
[01:23:30]  I see hate everywhere.  Stormfront and fucking Knicker Mania.  Here's my only issue with them.  You can write what you want.  Just use your name.  Just use your name when you write it.  You know what, though?  Too much persecution, even amongst racists.  You can't.  If you use your real name, you lose everything.  I mean, it's a brave stance to make, but it's, you know.  Yeah.  I understand your point.  There's nothing worse than a racist who's a coward and a racist, a closet racist who 
[01:24:00]  whispers naughty things.  Hey, I don't like blacks.  Me, me either.  I don't either.  But keep it on the cute team.  Because you could go on that website under your own name and say stuff that you don't  like about the black community.  Nobody would persecute for you.  They just don't.  They want to go on and say nigger this and nigger that.  And they want to be angry tough guys under fake names.  They're the fucking worst.  Well, what if.  With no consequence.  What if you want.  No consequence.  What if you want to express an opinion that is deemed racist? 
[01:24:30]  But in not just throwing around horrible epithets.  But in a reasonable fashion, you're just using whatever opinions you have, whatever it is.  And your name is tagged to it.  And then your employer sees it.  Now, just because you're exercising your freedom of speech, you should lose your job, which you  absolutely would.  The anonymous thing kind of comes with the territory because of the persecution you get  for having an opinion. 
[01:25:00]  Good or bad?  It's a pussy move.  Yeah.  Yeah, it really is.  There's no political opinion, by the way, or opinion because people bat around these  opinions all the time on TV.  No one's losing their job just for batting around an opinion.  The thing is, it's not about the opinions because you'll hear opinions about the black  community being fucking irritating or whatever you don't like.  That's not why they're hiding.  But I'm talking hardcore opinionated shit.  Like, why shouldn't you be able to do that without losing your job?  I agree with you.  I completely agree with you. 
[01:25:30]  If you want to go into a public forum and you want to say something publicly, then you  should say it publicly.  And if it comes down to because there could be a consequence of that, which is wrong,  you should never lose your job.  I don't care if you're a racist.  I don't necessarily like racists, but you shouldn't lose your fucking job for it.  Right.  Do you know what I mean?  It's almost like...  But you will.  See, we're not talking about what should happen.  We're talking about what does happen.  And if these guys put their name on there, they would absolutely lose their livelihood  and, you know, maybe family. 
[01:26:00]  But...  A bunch of fucking pussies going online under fake names and just saying we hate niggers  and this and that is fucking pussy.  I understand that part of it.  That's what I object to.  I mean, there are certain people that go to websites that are deemed racist websites  and post, believe it or not, some well-thought-out ideology.  Well, then how about you have to make that decision?  How about you have to make the decision of...  Of course, you can have your opinion and you can discuss it with people. 
[01:26:30]  But if you want to go into a public place, if you want to go into a public place and say  things, then you have to realize that there's going to be consequences, which there shouldn't  be.  Yeah.  And then fight to have those consequences.  Do you know what I mean?  Like, I know what you're saying, but I never think anybody should get in trouble for voicing  their opinion if it's done in a way that's acceptable.  I am a 100% freedom of speech guy.  I mean, I don't see any fucking barriers or hurdles should be thrown your fucking way 
[01:27:00]  when you're just voicing your opinion.  No matter...  And I honestly believe no matter how fucking heinous people find it, I think everything  is fair game when it comes to speech.  Uh...  But it's not that way.  And you definitely are sacrificing your livelihood if you do expose who you are in certain circumstances.  Like the Klan.  Well, like the Klan, but okay.  And then let's look at some of the black hate sites that are out there.  Those people can post their names and, uh, you know... 
[01:27:30]  Then the same goes for them.  The same...  Then the same...  I have the same opinion of them.  Yeah.  I actually haven't been to those.  But if they're going on into fake names, they're fucking pussies.  They're fucking social pussies.  They're not afraid of being beaten up physically, but they're socially cowards.  Where they want to talk a certain way and behave a certain way and give out certain...  Because if you're going to nigger mania or storm front, those are not just sites where  you're going to discuss political opinions. 
[01:28:00]  Those are hardcore sites.  Be that guy.  Fucking be that guy.  Well, it's very hard to make yourself a martyr, which is absolutely what you would be doing.  You'd be martyring yourself.  But if everybody stood up and fucking...  And said these things the way they feel, there's a lot more people probably than you  think saying them.  That is the number one social taboo in this country, by the way.  So I don't think it matters how many people are on a couple of websites.  I don't think anyone has the power to get up there. 
[01:28:30]  And it would never be portrayed in an acceptable light on the news.  But the fact of the matter is that even that speech is protected.  I agree.  So there shouldn't be consequence.  I 100% agree with you.  I don't want to...  Even though I don't like what people say sometimes, I don't ever want them in trouble for it.  But it's like...  Let's say back in 1990, before the internet.  These guys would have meetings or get together, but they all knew who each other was.  Well, back then, what you would get are these anonymous flyers that would end up...  On people's windshields, in parking lots, with a racist diatribe on them. 
[01:29:00]  But even then, it goes by the same thing.  And indeed, when you talk about the Klan, the same thing with the hoods.  The reason is, these were people in the communities that really did not want to be exposed to what they were doing.  Exactly.  They were fucking cowards.  They wanted to...  But they wanted to...  It wasn't like one guy with a Klan hood would walk into a black neighborhood and just didn't want to be exposed.  They would make sure there was a 50 on one. 
[01:29:30]  They were fucking...  They're just cowards.  Post under your real name.  I don't care what it is.  We're not in communist China.  I know that there might be fucking ramifications for it.  But the ramifications far exceed what is being done, is what I'm saying.  You can talk about other things, not race-related, which I said is the number one social taboo, racism and race discussions.  But let's say something else that isn't quite as... gets people fired up.  You could use your real name and be the person that really does want to stand up for that and make a change. 
[01:30:00]  A lot of people are doing with Occupy.  They use their real names and whatnot.  And, you know, they're looked at as assholes and shitheads by a lot of people.  But that's something you can make a stand and say, hey, I want everybody to come forward and back me on this and let's make a change.  You can't do that with something so horrific that people see as racist.  Then, okay, fair enough.  Yeah.  But then don't go on and play phony brave. 
[01:30:30]  Don't go on...  Don't go on and use rhetoric like brave rhetoric.  They're not just voicing opinions.  They're like, ah, these fucking...  Like, they're talking like a guy who would say that to a guy.  It's almost like going on to a UFC site anonymously.  They go, ah, this fucking pussy can't fight.  And it's like, well, you wouldn't...  You wouldn't say that, so don't say it under a fake name.  It's like the message boards that we deal with on a much different level.  They're not afraid of social persecution.  Yeah.  People just get very brave in anonymity. 
[01:31:00]  But it's just too much consequence for just expressing an idea, ideology, your freedom of speech.  The consequence far out exceeds the fucking...  Then go on and say that.  Go on and say, I'm scared of the consequences, so I'm going to go into this name.  But they don't acknowledge that fucking part of it.  I have seen people that do say that.  I've seen people that say, you know, I would love to voice opinions, but I, you know, have a job.  You know, there are people, I think, with, like, very radical ideology on any subject that know they cannot say things. 
[01:31:30]  And I don't think just because they post or say things anonymously, that necessarily makes them instantly a coward.  I do.  Really?  I hate anonymity.  I hate...  I've never once, and I know I make my living talking, but I've never once had the desire to go anonymously somewhere.  I've never wanted to do it.  I figure if I'm going to say something, I have to say it. 
[01:32:00]  And if I get in trouble for it or whatever, but...  And not anonymity like that, I fucking despise.  I understand.  Despise it.  I understand you 100%.  I just...  In real world, you know, in the real world, it doesn't work.  It doesn't work because there's too many people that do not understand our constitutional rights  and do not understand that your right to horrific opinions and ideology and speech should have zero consequence except for the actual consequence. 
[01:32:30]  If you want to say something like that and you decide you're walking around and a black guy wants to come up and punch you in the fucking face,  hey, that's the consequence that you've decided you want to put out there that that might happen to you.  But you should not be...  You should not lose your job based on...  I agree.  ...on your ideology and your speech unless you're bringing some horrid thing into the workplace.  But most of them don't.  I think the majority of people, they say they don't want to lose their job. 
[01:33:00]  But most times what they're really afraid of is just the black co-workers seeing them and putting that opinion with that face.  No, it wouldn't be.  But that's what it is.  It's not necessarily about losing the job for a lot of them.  It's just they just don't want the people that they know to know that they feel that way.  Again, the hoods.  So they're fucking pussies.  You're right.  Again, it's the hoods.  They're fucking pussy.  You know, they want to spout off really loud, but they don't want people looking at them knowing that that was the guy that said it.  I just don't think that's everybody.  I don't think it's everybody.  And I don't think you can put the 100% coward label on anonymous speech. 
[01:33:30]  Whistleblowers are one thing.  But when you're just going on and shit talking, which is what most of them are just doing.  Again, I firmly believe you have the right to do it.  And I don't want to see you penalized for it.  Yeah.  But I hate when they use fake fucking name.  I detest that because they usually find an empowering name.  Right, right, right.  You know, race fighter.  You know what I mean? 
[01:34:00]  Black Crusher.  Yowza.  This guy's fucking brave.  You know.  That's what is.  Again, they're playing the equivalent of an online game.  But this is they're just they're being phony brave.  Well, Jimmy, I guess what are we going to have to do?  Blow each other.  Completely agree.  We're just going to have to agree to blow each other.  I just hate it.  I hate it.  I hate it.  Yeah.  I know.  You always have. 
[01:34:30]  Hate it.  You've always had that opinion.  And you know what?  I can't argue with your opinion on that.  But there's people that can't even use their real names when they're trashing us.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  It's the same mentality.  I see what Anne's saying.  Well, because we would persecute Sam.  But even on a low level, they're not brave enough to use their real names.  And that's what bothers me.  And to me, there's nothing wrong with going on online to a website.  If you don't like blacks in saying that, like, I really believe that, too. 
[01:35:00]  Even though I wouldn't agree with you, I have no issue with that because you're allowed that opinion.  You're allowed that fucking opinion.  But what do we do?  So it's like because there's penalties for saying things where there shouldn't be, do none of us just say any things?  Well, you do.  I think you've got to dance around things sometimes.  I think you've got to be a little creative.  But there are other people that want to delve into it a little deeper with a little more detail.  And in those situations, you would be totally persecuted.  And there's plenty of people that go on sites and talk about abortion and religion. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, right, right.  And very, very controversial subjects.  And in this age of the Internet, because we very rarely, how did we do it anonymously before, before just firing out letters or secret meetings?  Actually, a Sharpie on the bathroom wall.  Right.  That was anonymous.  That's what this is.  Write whatever the fuck you want on there, you know.  No one's going to know.  And you talked among yourselves.  In school, it was on your desk.  The guy that sits here during third period sucks my dick.  Fuck you, I'll kick your ass.  Who are you? 
[01:36:00]  I wrote that.  Fuck you, asshole.  I wrote that, and I was in third period.  By the way, to Ann's point, the Facebook password thing is, you know, gaining some fucking momentum.  Is it?  That's sickening.  I got a tweet from Pat from, not Pat from Monaco, excuse me, Pat fucking Duffy.  And he said his, maybe he could call on the show.  He says his girlfriend got fired because she refused to give up her Facebook password.  Wow, really?  So it actually happened?  Well, she probably has a case at this point. 
[01:36:30]  It hasn't been...  Let me see what you can find on Twitter.  Get yourself a lawyer.  Start litigating, motherfuckers.  Yeah, it was a DM.  So he wrote, so my girlfriend got fired for the content of her Twitter.  It goes back to Ann's point, the consequences for just basic shit.  Yeah, there's a prime example.  Now, you got your Twitter.  You got your Facebook.  You don't want to be anonymous on that.  You want to share some things, your ideas, pictures, whatnot.  How come you have to face consequences based on, and it doesn't have to be race. 
[01:37:00]  It could be anything.  That's sickening.  That your employer deems...  Yeah.  Terrible.  That's terrible.  It should be just the type of job you're doing at the office.  What kind of job wants your fucking Facebook password?  More and more.  What if creatively, artistically, whatever, you want to share something that would be deemed  offensive to an employer, and you should, just so you don't come off as a coward, should  post your name anyway?  Or maybe you should have a pseudonym that you could then put your work out there and not  be persecuted for it.  Right.  This is a big issue.  I don't think it's a coward in every circumstance, what I'm saying. 
[01:37:30]  I mostly do because they're not...  The opinions they're expressing, the basic opinions, are normally not offensive opinions.  They're opinions that are fairly...  And most...  Again, let's just say, they're opinions that are fairly allowable.  And fair...  I mean, by allowable, I mean, you're not going to get in trouble for them, even if they're  socially unacceptable.  But that's not what they're doing.  They want to go on and pretend to be this guy.  And I just hate that.  Because, again, they want to go on and go, he's fucking... 
[01:38:00]  It's like, they want to say it in a way that they wouldn't dare say it publicly.  It's not the opinion, like saying, hey, look, why are blacks fucking behaving like this  and running in and doing these flash mobs?  I, Jim Norton, say that.  The fucking mayor of Philly said that.  Yeah.  They can say that.  But they don't want to say that.  Right.  They want to say, how come he's fucking nigger?  But they don't want the consequence of saying that.  So it's not the opinion.  It's they want to fucking brave it up.  Right.  And say it as aggressively...  It's like, if you want to do that, fair enough.  Do it, but fucking deal with it. 
[01:38:30]  Let me get to this.  So, Pat fucking Duffy on Twitter without the Gs.  So, my girlfriend got fired for the content of her Twitter.  Oh, this is different than her Facebook.  Kissing him after he ate shit.  This is different than the Facebook thing, but in the same fucking area, obviously.  Didn't say anything bad about the company or her coworkers.  Just spoke like an adult.  So fucked up, man.  They're going to be eventually censoring people in their own home.  Sorry to bother you.  I want to eat shit soon for your show.  No.  Sorry to bother you with it. 
[01:39:00]  Just thought you'd get it.  So we got Pat Duffy on the line here.  All right.  Pat, what did your girlfriend say on Twitter?  Pat!  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey, Pat.  Listen, first and foremost, I don't want to put too much detail because I feel like they're  watching me, too.  So I don't want to get in trouble.  But I guess the other day was National Cleavage Day on Twitter or some other, you know, hashtag  thing that they do.  Right.  And she posted a picture of her tattoo, which is this old school pinup girl.  And she's got, like, you know, a big set of tits. 
[01:39:30]  And she put a picture of that.  And, like, later that day, they called her into the main office.  And they had that picture on the desk.  And they're like, are you this person in real life?  Because we don't want you to work for us.  This is the person you are outside of work.  What the fuck does that mean?  Hold on.  What kind of job does she have?  That's a lawsuit.  Well, she takes care of adults with developmental disabilities.  All right.  Well, that would explain her attraction.  But what does she do for work? 
[01:40:00]  She doesn't want old guys dropping a heart attack.  But to me, I think that's right.  That should be a lawsuit.  Like, that's sickening that she should absolutely be able to do.  There should be no penalty at all.  She's doing her job well and stuff.  And what she does outside of work, especially if it's not, you know, drive-by shootings, that's fine.  And this is where, like, what Pat's talking about, and even to your point, this is where we don't defend each other.  And this is where we as a country stink.  Because back in the old days, as much as I had certain problems with the forefathers, they stuck up for each other. 
[01:40:30]  I mean, they kind of banded together, and this was what we were doing.  Against the blacks.  Yes, fair enough.  As we should have.  But this is where we're all frauds.  Like, I think the guys should defend each other.  Like, the guys on Stormfront or whatever should defend those guys on those black sites' right to say what they want.  If we're living in a true democracy and freedom of speech is truly valued, if everybody stuck up for each other's rights, we would never have penalties.  Right.  Because we would allow – so we're all fucking – it's kind of a bigger picture thing where we just let each other get in trouble. 
[01:41:00]  But if a guy's a radical fucking black Muslim and he hates whitey, I never want to see that guy get in trouble.  No.  And I would defend that guy's right to say what he wants.  Believe me, I enjoy reading the militant black websites, too.  I enjoy reading them because they're so outrageous.  I find them fun, but I also find them educational.  You kind of see what each – the extremes on each side are thinking.  If we weren't the type of country that just let each other swing with our dicks in the wind, if we were honest and really believed that free speech should come without penalty, there wouldn't be penalties. 
[01:41:30]  Right.  Because employers would know that the backlash for penalizing unpopular speech was a horrible backlash.  But we love freedom of speech when we agree with it.  When it's ours.  Oh, when it's our speech, boy, will we say, hey, freedom of speech, and then the first people that turn on something that they find offensive or repulsive, then they're like,  I can't – get that off.  Fire them.  Do something.  Most people don't – 
[01:42:00]  Fuck you, you pussies.  Most people in this country don't like freedom of speech.  No, they don't.  They hate it.  They think they do, but they prove time and time again they don't like it.  They want it for them and everyone that thinks like them.  See, that's why it's so painful when someone says something you don't agree with, that you defend their right to say it.  Always.  You have to every fucking time.  It's hard.  Trust me, it's hard sometimes.  A lot of these radio guys that we've supported over the years, I fucking hate their guts.  I do.  Yeah.  But you have to defend their right to say their shit. 
[01:42:30]  Every time you should defend it.  Whether you agree with it or not.  Doesn't matter.  Yeah, it's easy to go, oh, good, that guy's going to get fired, and I hope he does for what he said.  Yeah, that would be the easy thing to say.  Getting back to courage.  Courage.  The courageous thing is to stick up for a guy that you fucking don't agree with.  Look at the Westboro Baptist Church.  I mean, as repulsive as they are.  I think they're the worst people in the country.  Oh, yeah.  I do think that there is a necessity to them because they test our freedom of speech. 
[01:43:00]  Right.  And if we can tolerate that as a country, and we do.  It's repulsive.  It's repulsive speech.  That's a tough one, man.  It's a tough one because they're going to a soldier's funeral.  Oh, it's horrible.  It is a tough one.  That challenges what you're supposed to do.  It's horrible what they do.  But what they do, at least in a social medium, is what freedom of speech is for.  It's for repulsive, disagreeable speech to be allowed within certain constraints, meaning that you can't just – again, you can't yell fire in a movie theater. 
[01:43:30]  So they're good – they should be the barometer.  Like, we tolerate that.  So a bunch of guys being racist on a black site or a white site should absolutely be fucking allowable.  Is there any other example besides fire in a movie theater?  Yes, inciting people to riot.  Yeah.  And what's the other one?  Like, defamation and slander is not covered.  Right, right, right.  There's a few things like that that are covered.  There's not many.  And how many people didn't yell fire in a movie theater because they weren't totally sure?  And they didn't want to get in trouble.  Smell and smoke.  They're like, I don't know.  Well, I've learned my whole life not to yell fire in a movie theater. 
[01:44:00]  There's a – I might go to prison for this if I'm not right.  Well, they said movie house, I believe.  Yes, the movie house.  And how many people have misinterpreted that and been let go from their job at Lowe's and thought the manager was wrong?  He said I was fired from the movie theater.  No, no.  You're getting it wrong.  You can't sue him for that.  I'll boo myself.  I hope Pat Duffy, if that's the facts that Pat laid out, I hope his girlfriend sues.  I agree.  You know, I hope that happens. 
[01:44:30]  Let's break.  So what happened with the chicken thing?  We're all good.  Mary J. Blige.  They pulled it down.  They're not –  She's a chicken.  It's not good.  She just should have allowed it to be the fucking commercial.  Who gives a fuck?  Yeah, come on.  But these guys can go on.  These black guys, whatever his name is, Ture or whatever, who's a douche.  But he should be able to say what he wants.  Of course.  But Piers, I guess, slapped him down.  Yes, he did.  He did slap him down.  Joe Ture.  It's the third time I said it.  I know.  It's terrible.  It's just the silliness of it.  Of course it's dumb. 
[01:45:00]  Ture.  So what, did he rip something in half?  Ah, hip hip, hooray.  How about to a B?  We could go all the way down to Z.  I got 26 of these.  Look at Sammy over there, digging iron.  No, don't do it.  Oh, he's fine.  Look at him.  He's always spinning.  Not again.  He's tussling his hat.  Oh, you got shot?  Are you happy that Josh got shot?  Yeah.  Before the show came on, he said to see my baseball hat was for it.  Come here. 
[01:45:30]  Come here, yo.  We're talking to you.  I would like to hear a little bit of this guy.  It's a long clip.  Ture.  Can we throw through a filter and edit it a little bit?  It's like eight minutes long.  I just want to hear a little race fading.  We'll do it after the break.  Also, Eugene Levy's coming by today.  And Maggie Grace from Taken.  Yes.  And Lost.  Yeah, she was in Lost.  She was the one that ran funny in Taken?  Yes.  Dare we bring it up?  Yes.  Dare we bring it up?  We will absolutely bring it up.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And maybe we talk about Augusta next. 
[01:46:00]  There's problems down there in Augusta.  Somebody said directly threatening the president, too.  That's obviously not allowable.  Oh, well.  Yeah, of course.  Can't do that.  Can't do that.  Yeah.  And, yeah.  All right.  This is the Opie and Anthony True.  On Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Network brings you the hottest new primetime dating game show, presenting  Unmatchables, where two completely incompatible people are locked in a room and forced to 
[01:46:30]  make awkward conversations.  How old are you?  Did you say that?  I'm almost 30.  You're almost 30.  Well, you look very good.  You look very pretty.  Watch the season premiere as Australian comedian and drunkard Jim Jeffries attempts to seduce  American adult starlet Justine Jolie.  Hey, you'll learn to love me.  Over time, you will love me.  Will Justine be impressed by Jim's plush living arrangements?  I have a studio flat in LA, which has a pungent smell that I can't find, but I'm going to  endeavor to find that.  And then you'll get quite the raping.  Wow. 
[01:47:00]  That was a joke.  Come on.  That was funny.  Look, I've got a little accent.  Will Jim be able to woo Justine with his thoughts of romance?  I don't like kissing girls, right?  I used to like kissing girls when I was like 14 or 15, but then after I got my dick sucked,  I was over kissing.  Kissing is now a dead zone for me.  That's really unfortunate, because that's one of the main things that I really enjoy about  a man.  Or his thoughts on making love.  I'd rather have a threesome that involves a guy and a girl, because I like seeing the  cock going into her mouth as I'm fucking her.  I just like seeing a girl being degraded. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, degraded.  Oh, oh, he stopped himself before he said it.  I said degraded, you slut.  Can Jim Jeffries turn it all around?  I love you.  I don't mean that.  I love you.  I've never been in love before.  Probably not.  I would eat your poo.  That's a good thing, Jim.  It's not a good thing for you.  No, but it would be hilarious to fucking watch.  I'm going to dig it out with a knife.  Find out just how incompatible these two are.  Why does he hate me so much?  I don't hate you.  I'm just having fun.  On the latest, greatest late night dating game show, only on the Opie and Anthony Network, 
[01:48:00]  Unmatchables.  Yeah, always sexual tension with me and the guests, man.  Are we on the air right now?  Are we on the air?  Oh, you guys are on the air.  You guys are on the air right now?  Oh, we are on the air.  I don't know.  We're on the fucking air.  What are you guys doing?  Are you on air?  I can't tell you how many guests actually asked us.  Are we on the air?  I don't know if that's good or bad.  Are we about to go on?  We're kind of on.  That's what we do.  We're on the fucking thing.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We do that.  Are we on radio?  Yes.  Are we on the radio right now?  We just bring it in and let it roll.  Are we on?  Yeah, we just do it in. 
[01:48:30]  Are we on?  Yeah, we're on the air.  Are we actually on the air right now?  Yes, we're on the air.  Send up a sign, a red sign.  You got Kentucky Muscat on Louisville.  Sorry.  I got food.  I know, right?  I got my soupy. 
[01:49:00]  Well, Kentucky Muscat in Louisville writes, I yelled fire in a theater watching back drafts.  I didn't get in trouble.  Ah, very good.  And someone tweeted me and said that freedom, they said that it doesn't matter inciting people  to riot.  Any political speech could incite people to riot.  It has nothing to do with free speech, but it does.  It's in there.  And it's not about a political speech motivating people.  It's when you're up there encouraging people to commit violent acts.  I don't know what the exact thing, but it is in there.  I think any speech that would get a group holding pitchforks and torches riled up, that would 
[01:49:30]  probably be inciting.  Yeah, I don't know what the line is, but it is in there, sir.  And it would have to be, I guess, discussed.  And, you know, I think if you were actually arrested for that, you could probably get  away with saying it was freedom of speech.  But in many cases, I mean, look, it's when's the last time somebody was arrested for inciting  a person to riot?  Yeah.  And there's been some gatherings that have been pretty.  Except at my shows, because I'm a riot.  You want a regular riot?  A riot. 
[01:50:00]  A riot, Alice.  Augusta, the Masters, they start today for all the golf fans out there.  Did you see the shot that, I don't know his name, Martin, did you see it?  No.  It's a video that's, the guy got a shitty fucking video of it.  But basically, it's tradition during the practice round on Wednesday, on this part three, the  golfers take their drivers and skip it in the water.  Really?  And try to land it on the green. 
[01:50:30]  Not only did this guy land it on the green, Martin, fuck, what's his name?  Mull.  Calmer.  Sheen.  Kamer.  Comma Trayvon.  Uncle Martin.  He skipped his driver.  My favorite, Martin.  Yeah, Martinizing.  This guy blew it.  He could have had one of the greatest videos ever.  Kimer, I want to say.  Martin Kimer.  So he skips his driver on the pond at the part three. 
[01:51:00]  Pooled upon.  Because it's tradition, I believe.  I never heard of this one before.  Oh, I just hate it.  Lands on the green.  Everyone's like, holy fuck, you did it.  That's great.  And then all of a sudden, the ball starts rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling,  rolling.  Hole in one.  No way.  After skipping it off the pond.  He skipped it off the pond.  But you can't really see in this video.  So they're like all cheering.  Because he made the green, right?  And then they notice it's starting to roll toward the fucking hole. 
[01:51:30]  Wow.  Can you see?  Yeah.  It's hard to see, I thought.  That was exciting.  Oh, did you see that, though?  Everybody.  Wow.  Martin Kimer.  Jimmy, I swear.  Timer, I don't know.  Where's the ball?  I can't see it still.  Oh, there it is.  It's one pixel.  I know.  That's the problem.  Wow, that's fucking cool.  Somebody else has video of it, I'm sure.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:52:00]  You're supposed to skip what off the thing?  The fucking ball, actually.  Like when you skip a rock, the ball goes on the top of the water.  It popped up on the green and actually went in the fucking hole.  That's a video game shot.  But it's scary that that's tradition because, you know, the hole is packed with spectators.  And you're attempting to skip your driver off the pond?  What's fucked up?  That could be a major problem.  What's fucked up is every time I've ever hit the water, it's just gone bloop.  Just skipping it on the water would be a miracle.  Never mind hitting the green and then never mind getting it in a fucking hole. 
[01:52:30]  What do we know about this?  Is it tradition?  Does every guy try to do the skip shot?  I'm surprised.  In this practice round at Augusta?  We haven't had a visit from the doctor because he usually comes running in when there's a baseball or golf talk.  I mean, Dr. Gay!  Someone shot a video from the other side of the hole.  Is that a better copy?  Someone has to have it.  Yeah, come on.  In this era.  That's an amazing shot.  It's hard to even see where it hit the water.  Where it skipped on the water. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  You kind of see.  It goes like.  Whoa.  There it is.  All right.  There it is.  I see the ball.  You do see it?  Yeah.  That's fucked up.  Come on.  That's fucked up.  I'd hate that to be the next guy.  Oh, man.  Right?  He probably hit it and went right into the water.  Bloop.  Whoa.  That's just fucked up.  No? 
[01:53:30]  That is.  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  That's a good clip.  That's a great clip.  So what do you think about Augusta, man?  I have mixed feelings.  Well, it's tradition.  It's a men's club.  And every once in a while, you get some of these bull dykes.  The last time, it was a bunch of bull dykes that probably didn't even care about golf or anything.  Trying to make a stand.  And Augusta shut him down and said, no, we're going to not have women in this club.  This is how it's been, and we want to keep it this way.  And they played without sponsors for a couple of years.  Right.  No commercials.  Here's the problem. 
[01:54:00]  I guess every CEO that sponsors Augusta, thank you, they get a membership, an honorary membership to Augusta.  And in most cases, or all cases up until this year, the CEO is a guy.  Right.  Well, the IBM CEO is Ginny.  Ginny Romady, I guess.  So they're like, oh, shit.  Now what do we do?  A woman running a company?  So they're like, we usually give honorary memberships to the CEO of these companies that sponsor Augusta. 
[01:54:30]  So now they're stuck.  Now they're in a weird quandary because if they say, well, look, rules are rules.  We can't give you an honorary membership.  IBM certainly could pull their sponsorship, which would be a lot of money.  But they can handle it.  I think that's what they have to do.  So stick with what you do because I hate golfers and I hate that culture, but it is their club.  They can do what they want.  I absolutely don't have mixed emotions on this.  I think if guys want to get together and have a guys-only golf course. 
[01:55:00]  A guys club.  I think it's fine.  Yeah.  It should be absolutely fine.  And if women really believe that they're powerful and equal, then why don't they just get their women together and go fucking do their club?  Because most guys wouldn't give a fuck.  Just about every guy wouldn't care.  Here's the problem.  With the whole situation with women coming into these men-oriented clubs and workplace and whatever, then believe me, I'm trying not to sound 1955 here.  My birthday.  You get women that come into, like, let's say Augusta. 
[01:55:30]  You have the guy members that are there that have been used to a certain way of enjoying their club, which might have, you know, some pictures that they might put some up on the wall.  Strippers.  Fucking jokes that are told around the clubhouse.  Things like that.  Now, when women come in, it's like, well, we just want to be equal.  We want to do this.  It doesn't affect you.  It's just women coming in.  Your archaic fucking thinking is this.  Then they let the women in.  Can I sell you that right there?  Yeah.  At that point, I'd be like, okay. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  But it's never that.  No.  And I know where you're going with this, but I just want to stop you there.  Because now everything that you've enjoyed, the freedom to just be guys and be assholes and tell dumb jokes, fart in front of each other, tell a dirty joke.  Gets fucking taken away because you're threatened with lawsuits because these women want to fucking, you know, hang their frilly curtains up in the window.  I heard on the fourth hole today.  Figuratively speaking.  Right?  Absolutely right.  I heard on the fourth hole today.  Dr. Johnson was telling a joke.  I was very offended. 
[01:56:30]  I don't need to hear that one.  Fuck you.  On the seventh hole, he actually urinated on the side of the fairway.  Ah, he said that she was hit between the first and second hole, and he pointed to his taint.  But that's right.  As Keith Robinson said, women fuck up fun.  Right.  That when they get into groups, then they start bitching and moaning and wanting to change things.  I have.  You want to come in as equals, fine.  But equals means, you've got to fucking either leave the room or laugh at the joke. 
[01:57:00]  But it never is that way.  I have no mixed emotions on this.  I really, truly believe.  Yeah, but this is more of like a.  Especially in leisure.  Leisure.  I want to pronounce it like that.  Leisure.  Especially in your leisure time.  You know, you should be able to, if you want to join a club where it's just men only, then you should be able to do that.  And then let the women do their club.  There are gyms that are dedicated to just women.  That's true.  Because guys have been, you know.  Hot bed of fat chicks, by the way.  Huh?  Hot bed of fat chicks, those gyms. 
[01:57:30]  That's nice talk.  Because they're the women that don't want guys to see them because they make fun of them.  The hot chicks go to the fucking gyms because they want to be looked at.  But look, I would love to see what's going on in a women's only gym.  But guess what?  Lesbian sex.  It doesn't fucking bother me.  I don't give a fuck.  They have their own gyms.  Who cares?  Exactly.  This is more of like an honorary title, though.  Yeah, but it's a foot in the door shit.  It's a high heel in the door.  It's a foot in the door shit.  Women can already.  Also, that high heel's in the door.  Women can already play at Augusta's guests. 
[01:58:00]  Boom!  When did that happen?  A couple years back.  Say a couple years back.  You think the members like that?  Women can play as guests.  Look, I have a little bit of experience because I.  Me and your father built this club.  I worked at a golf course for over 14 years.  And when the women came around, it was just a drag.  Well, they're already there.  Also, the guys that you knew had great personalities and had a good dirty joke or a good story.  Also, they're not saying shit.  Yeah, yeah.  And this is in the 80s before it got way over the top politically correct. 
[01:58:30]  When you were a child.  When I was a child in the 80s, caddying at the Huntington Crescent Club.  Yes.  The only reason I have mixed feelings is because I hate these golf clubs.  Like, not people who play golf.  Well, how are you supposed to golf without them?  Because I just think you should kick the ball or use your big, delicious cock.  Oh, mighty.  But they exclude everybody.  Like, they don't want blacks.  They wouldn't allow us there.  They wouldn't allow us there.  So I shouldn't defend them.  I just kind of detest them, yeah.  I shouldn't defend them because we wouldn't, you know, have a chance of being members there.  Any club that would have me as a member. 
[01:59:00]  Right, exactly.  That's actually my quote.  Well, my, maybe we could get some women on the phone today.  My question is this.  Yeah, you know how to dial a phone skirt?  Exactly.  Pick it up broad.  You're always on the phone anyway, yapping while you're cooking.  Pretend you're making stuffing.  Pick up the phone, put down your crock pot holders, and dial us fucking, dial us broads.  You got the phone all crooked between your fucking head and neck.  That stupid fucking whiplash head they get from the phone.  And just pretend you're stuttering because that's the only way you seem to be able to talk, broad.  Get your whisk. 
[01:59:30]  Get your egg whisk and beat some egg whites.  Yeah, I want to hear this while you're talking.  Well, I think, shuck, shuck, shuck, shuck, shuck, shuck, shuck, shuck, shuck, shuck, shuck, shuck, shuck, shuck.  Golf originally stood for gentlemen only, ladies forbidden.  Nah, that's a dumb joke, right?  That's fake.  It probably said, hey, go over Larry's, Frank.  That's probably what it stood for.  Go over Larry's, Frank.  I'll bet you they would always knock the ball in the hole over Larry's. 
[02:00:00]  And Frank was drunk one time.  And they're like, go over Larry's, Frank, just because they wanted Frank to get out of there and go knock the ball in the hole.  And it kept happening, so they just used the acronym.  Hey, golf.  It's like, oh, go over Larry's, Frank.  Yeah, okay.  Well, we got a lot of good questions going in.  Do we?  Yes, we do.  By the way.  I hope it ain't from broads.  Exactly.  It'd be dumb questions about, like, shoes.  And recipes.  Yeah.  How much sugar?  I don't know, broad.  You figure it out.  Make sure it tastes good.  We're going to learn more about that shot from Tom, because I did not know this was a tradition at Augusta. 
[02:00:30]  Tom, go ahead.  Hey, it was absolutely amazing.  I wish I had seen it, but I walked up right after it happened.  So you didn't see it if you walked up right after it happened.  I know, but what it is, it's on the 16th hole, it's on Monday.  They hit their shot, and then the crowd starts chanting, skip it, skip it.  And so they walk up to the water line of the 16th hole, and they get the ball out, and they skip it across. 
[02:01:00]  And so basically, it's the crowd.  Epic fail.  Epic fail.  Epic fail.  Is this tradition?  That's all I need to know.  And how many golfers do it?  How many golfers are willing to risk a lawsuit?  Everyone I saw got goaded into doing it.  Right.  And some of them did it more than once.  Wow, that's crazy.  What would goad have to do with it?  I don't know.  Let me get that.  Thank you, sir.  That's talking nonsense.  It's been around since, like, the 80s. 
[02:01:30]  Let me say hi to John in San Antonio.  John, because he has more info on the skip shot.  Yeah, I was at the 2001 practice day, and I got a VHS of Tiger Woods hitting it across  the water and beaming a lady in the chest.  With his cock?  I can't figure out how to get it off of VHS to get it on YouTube, because it's a perfect  picture.  You can clearly see him.  You can see the ball skipping across the water, and it catches the lady right in the  chest.  I don't care how good these guys are. 
[02:02:00]  They are risking lawsuits, because, I mean, everyone's crowded around.  They're on the green, and they're trying to skip a driver off the water.  And it's kind of an unnecessary shot, so it's not like it's during gameplay where, you know.  I think, though, whenever you step on that golf course to watch, I think there are plenty  of signs that say, hey, whatever the fuck happens to you, that's what happens.  It would be thrown out immediately.  You knew the risk you took when you went there.  Right.  When you walk on their golf course, you're giving up your right to shoot them.  There is a chance you could be hit with a golf club, a golf ball, and you do know that.  Golf club. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, exactly.  So if you have two clubs put into your vagina and anus, while a bunch of people yell, get  off my field, get off the course, broad.  Do you think actually raping women with golf clubs is covered under that disclaimer sign?  Well, there was the one case of a young lady who showed up, and she was told to bring lemonade,  and she forgot.  So they put her on the ground, and they put their golf clubs in her asshole, and they  used her as a swiffer.  And she complained that that was not nice.  They just pointed to the sign that says he's not responsible. 
[02:03:00]  All right, guys, y'all have a good day.  We got a great one coming in, the firehouse.  Here we go.  We've talked about this before.  Oh, right.  Let's go to PH, and we'll continue with our discussion.  PH.  Balance.  Acid or alkaline?  Yeah, I want a balanced discussion.  Well, how's your litmus paper?  Yeah.  Hey, I'm PH, too.  Yay.  Chemistry joke.  Yeah.  Yeah, I tell you, you want to get a little bit of blood, you put the white stuff in the 
[02:03:30]  doodle, and it makes blood.  That's your chemistry lesson.  Go ahead.  Talks.  Sorry.  Yeah, Ann, you are 100% right.  You put a woman in a firehouse, it ruins everything.  The firehouse, I mean, yes, it's a dangerous job, but-  Boys club, right.  Boys club.  Yeah, yeah.  And what do we do all day?  Sit around, fart, make jokes, we put up pictures of naked girls, but you know what?  We can't do that anymore because EEO comes down and kills us.  And because they wanted equality and said, we should be able to join the fire department 
[02:04:00]  just like the men and be equals.  It's like, okay, equals?  No.  Now they come in as superiors dictating their fucking morality and tastes and opinions on  the guys that were there for years fucking, you know, just having fun and blowing off  some steam.  The men end up losing their equality.  Right.  That's the whole thing.  If we're such equals, then how come they get on the job without having to do everything  that we had to do?  Right, right.  Some of the physical tests aren't as stringent, are they? 
[02:04:30]  Which is ridiculous because when you're in a position where you're going to have to use  physical strength, it should be an equal test.  When I see some of these female cop videos when they're trying to take down a perp, let's  say a large gentleman at a traffic stop, and they just are getting the shit beat out of  them.  They're being outwrestled, and at usually any point, a guy could just grab their gun.  I mean, there has to be a certain thing.  Women have to understand sometimes that, generally speaking, they're just not as physically strong 
[02:05:00]  as men.  I'm not saying every circumstance.  It's going to be a shitload of women that could kick the shit out of a shitload of guys.  I'm talking basically.  It's just a rule of fucking nature.  We live in a fucked up world where we lower the standard.  Yeah, we lower the standard.  For a physical job?  That's crazy.  Yeah, yeah.  Why do we do that shit?  Yeah, exactly.  Our lives are at stake.  Yeah, I know.  All right, PH.  Firehouse is a good example.  I mean, you know, guys like being guys in a firehouse, and they certainly can't do that 
[02:05:30]  anymore.  Hey, PH, what happens when I put vinegar and baking soda together?  Oh, boy, not good.  He's gone.  See?  He's PH.  He should tell me.  He was too scared to answer that question.  Oh, my God.  Denise works for IBM, I guess.  Denise, what's up?  No, hey, I actually work in marketing.  Sorry about those fish fillets never making it over there.  Yeah, that's what it stands for.  They've got a broad run of the company.  It stands for I Blow Men. 
[02:06:00]  That's what IBM stands for.  Hey, if that's how you have to get ahead.  I Bake Muffins.  That's what IBM stands for.  I bake muffins.  Very good.  I bake meringue pies or something.  Hey, whatever it takes.  Whatever it takes, Chip.  I'll make you whatever you want.  Oh, thank you.  No, but I don't work for IBM, but I work in marketing for a drug company. 
[02:06:30]  And you vet those sponsorships.  What, birth control pills?  Yeah, exactly.  What are you marketing?  What kind of drugs?  Hormones for your periods?  Yeah.  If it's Valtrex, thank you.  A little, you know, Dick's Differ, you know, sometimes.  Oh, a little Viagra, a little Cialis.  Yeah, a little bit of that, yeah.  There you go.  A lot of good stuff.  Stiff competition in that field.  I'm not done laughing.  Right.  No, but they knew what they, you know, they bought the sponsorship. 
[02:07:00]  It's all in the contract.  So they knew what they were doing when they, when they bought the, the sponsorship.  Oh, that's true.  This was no surprise.  Yeah, exactly.  So they, they knew, they put their name all over it.  They're getting a lot back.  What are you cooking right now?  What are you whipping up for the man in your life?  A couple eggs, some bacon.  What do you want?  Getting the kids off to school, are you?  Packing their lunch.  I already did that.  Wearing an apron, are you?  Like a good 50s woman in an apron. 
[02:07:30]  Nice, something frilly.  Nothing underneath.  Is that hot?  Yeah, it is.  Okay, now you're talking.  Now we're talking.  When you're done rattling those pots and pans, get your ass into the bedroom.  I hear you.  Anything else there, Denise?  No, no, but I just wanted to point that out.  All right.  Eric in Kentucky.  Eric.  What's up, guys?  How's everybody this morning?  All right.  I want to hear from heaven.  We're about to hear from heaven, Ant.  Go ahead, Eric.  Well, I had a recent lull in employment about last year, and an election in Kentucky went 
[02:08:00]  up for the local fire department, and the physical test used to be, you know, lugging  hoses upstairs and all that kind of shit, but they've gotten incredibly standardized.  They roll it all on an 18-wheeler, set it up in, like, an empty warehouse, and they're  putting men and women through exactly the same test.  Oh!  That doesn't happen in New York, sir.  Now, did they lower the test for the men also?  See, that's the thing.  Oh, it's an equal test.  Well, it's not the same test it was 20 years ago. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, that's a great question.  Did they bring down the whole thing?  No, you know, I don't think so.  I think they're much more able to recreate it consistently.  Ah, okay.  Yeah.  Well, look, I got no problem with anybody that can actually do the job.  Right.  You know, and I'm sure there's plenty of capable women that can fucking hump hoes upstairs better  than some guy counterparts, but, you know, it's got to be that.  It's got to be the women that can actually do the job and not the fact that they're just 
[02:09:00]  women and they're trying to show that their hiring practices are equal.  You should have seen some of these broads, man.  It was hilarious.  Yeah, bruises, right?  You know, on the first day where they're showing everybody what's going to happen in the test,  you've got the full range of individuals, little girly girls and everything.  And come test day, two months later, it was nothing but diesel dykes all over.  Weeded out those, yeah, weeded out the little ones, huh? 
[02:09:30]  That's right.  All right.  All right, man, on a space phone.  Man from outer space, telephone guy.  We got Florence checking in.  Florence Johnson.  Florence.  I hope it's a guy.  Florence.  Floreen.  Floreen.  Floreen.  Floreen.  Oh, I remember Floreen.  Oh, but this is fucking Floreen.  Fucking Floreen from Connecticut, I believe.  I don't like the fact that there's Floreen in my water.  That's right.  Yeah.  If you go black, you don't go back.  Ah, home. 
[02:10:00]  Love that one.  False.  I like to professimicate my love for Anthony.  Oh, yeah, baby.  You tell me.  That's what I'm talking about.  Yeah.  Everything tastes better on a cracker.  Oh, shit.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah.  Would you go there?  Oh, hell yeah.  You would go there?  Oh, man.  Yeah.  I play golf with the motherfucker, and I watch his balls.  I play Exxon, motherfucker.  I play Exxon. 
[02:10:30]  And I'll be drilling deep for oil, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What up, my sister?  Go back his ass up.  What you got for the program?  Say what?  What you got for the program, bitch?  Talk to me.  Listen, cracker.  Talk at me like that.  I don't know where this conversation's going. 
[02:11:00]  Listen, I'd be good at the firehouse.  Oh, yeah.  I'd be good at the firehouse.  I'll do whatever you want.  Yeah.  What would you do at the firehouse?  I said.  I said I'd play with the hoses.  Oh.  I'd be doing the pole dance.  So you'd be the whore at the firehouse.  That's what they're saying.  That's right.  And they'd be hanging up pictures of Flo-Rain.  Flo-Rain?  Are you, uh...  I have no problem with that.  Why aren't you getting ready for work this morning?  I'm unemployed. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, get the fuck out of here.  Well, what do you...  That's why you need to hire me.  You don't have to call me.  What do you do for a...  I do anything.  What was your last job?  On my last job, I was working on a computer.  On a computer?  What'd you do?  What kind of work?  I did anything they want.  Well, what two companies did you work for?  Yeah.  Well, I worked for, um, a water bottle company. 
[02:12:00]  A water bottle company.  On a computer.  On a computer.  Would you be like, we sold us 15 water bottles.  Let me key that in.  That's right.  And I filled them up with whatever they wanted.  Mm-hmm.  So you did a little bit of office work, and part of the office job was logging in stuff  on the computer.  Yeah, I did a little of this, a little of that.  Sure, jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none.  A little bit of office work.  How do you take care of all your children with, uh, no work?  I don't have no children.  What?  Say, what? 
[02:12:30]  Get the fuck out of here!  Mm-mm.  Mm-mm.  All right.  Look, Florine, I'd love to stay on the phone with you for seconds more, but we got to go.  Okay, where you going?  I got work to do.  We're going to go to break, I think.  Mm-hmm.  That's where we're going.  Where do you live, Florine?  Are you in Connecticut?  I think she's Connecticut.  I thought she was in D.C.  No.  Oh, because I'll be there next Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  Smoking crack.  12, 13, 14.  Yes, with the mayor of D.C. 
[02:13:00]  Don't talk to people in your house when you're on the phone with us.  Anthony.  Yes?  I'm going to friend you on Facebook.  Yeah, why don't you do that?  We want to know what she looks like.  I'm going to friend you on Facebook.  What do you look like, Florine?  You wouldn't give us your Facebook page last time.  That's right.  I'm good looking.  Look, I am good looking.  Florine.  Florine, if we put you on hold, will you give us your Facebook page?  No, I'm on friend Anthony, and then he's going to friend me. 
[02:13:30]  I'm on Al Jolson Facebook.  Who is Al Jolson?  Ah, he's some guy who used to be in blackface back in the old days.  You remember that?  Mammy, Mammy, how I love you.  How I love you.  My dear old Mammy.  Yes.  It's amazing that Ali wasn't thrilled to win a fucking gold medal for this country.  Amazing that he just didn't embrace the country when he came back.  What?  Anthony needs to log in to his Facebook.  I'm going to friend his ass today. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, shit.  That sounds like a fret.  I am.  I'm going to friend him.  All right.  You friend me.  I'll friend you back.  He's going to see what he's talking to.  All right, Florine.  I hear you, sugar.  Have a good day, Florine.  All right.  Right on.  I'll talk to y'all later.  Bye-bye, Florine.  All right.  With that, I know.  Florine.  With that, we're going to take a break.  And I think we talk to Eugene Levy next.  No, it's Maggie Grace.  Eugene's on first?  Maggie and then Eugene.  Eugene's at 930?  Maggie.  Maggie.  You're right.  Maggie Grace from Lost and that movie Taken. 
[02:14:30]  And Taken.  We've got to talk about how she was running.  A little funny.  And why she ran away from her father after she got the pony.  He gave you the little Susie microphone.  Dumb Mr. Microphone crappy thing.  Yeah, but why did you have to run so heavily?  Yeah, you could have just like, you know, talked to your dad a little more and gone,  Oh, I'll see the pony in a second.  Soy sauce there.  He'll just write soy sauce.  That is the funniest description of someone with a bad dye job.  Looks like he dyed his hair with soy sauce. 
[02:15:00]  Jimmy.  He really was a soy sauce haired ass.  I like the movie, though.  I did like it.  You know, it has its moments.  That, my friend, is where we part company.  I understand.  I thought it stunk like farts.  Well, she will be in here.  There were problems with the movie, but I like the action.  Sure.  All right.  All right.  The O.P. Anthony Channel.

Outer space prison taken over by violent inmates  Maggie plays the president's kidnapped daughter  Okay  Is there any movie that she's not kidnapped in?

They were telling you to wait?  Debacle  Oh, God  I hate the publicist, by the way  Wow, you're beautiful  Oh, thank you  Oh, Cleveland, Ohio  What's happening here?  Oh, that's where Jimmy's going to be  Oh, right?  Yeah  Lucky you  I'm from Ohio  Don't slag it off  I love Ohio  I'm shooting a special there  I chose Cleveland  Really?  Yeah  We're all going out to Cleveland  Like in a couple weeks 
[02:22:00]  Fantastic  Where part of Ohio?  Worthington  And where is that close to?  Columbus  Oh, okay  I was in Columbus  Cleveland  You shouldn't really know that  I know it's a bad rap  It's actually  I know Columbus  I know  We're on a radio station  It gets a big bad reputation  But it's phenomenal  I like the women from Ohio  I've actually had good dating success  Dating  I have to go by location  Sorry  He cleaned it up for you  Dating  Well, yeah  Midwest  So when did you  That's kind of Midwest, right?  Yeah  Oh, yeah 
[02:22:30]  Part of it all  Slower  Slower atmosphere  When did you  Make the move  And become a star?  Wow, what an awkward question  Is it?  It's worded where  If you answer it  When I was 16  Oh, really?  Which sounds much more sorted  Than it was  That really does  Because, you know  I just picture a greyhound bus  Pulling into LA  I know  The girl  All wide-eyed and wondering  Corn-fed  Fresh-faced  Yeah  Pushy-eyed  Innocent  Lamb to the slaughter  I'm going to be a star  And then, you know 
[02:23:00]  That guy pulls up in his car  To help  I'm going to make you a star  Yeah  What was kind of the first thing  You started getting into?  Was it commercials?  Did you do a dove?  Yeah, commercials  Paid my rent for a while  Really?  As a teenager  Yeah, and then  Sort of procedural dramas as well  Oh, okay  So like  The law and orders of it all  Many, many of those  CSIs yet did that one  You know  Always a victim  Always the victim  Always the victim  You're always like the victim  In your movies too  What does that say about me?  I don't know 
[02:23:30]  Either you're a victim  Or you play a victim very well  Imperiled female  Should be stamped on my forehead  Yeah  You don't come off though  Like an imperiled female  Hell no  No  You can say a lot worse than hell  In this atmosphere  You can say fuck  Heck even  Gee willikers know  Why is that sexy?  I don't know  Have you ever heard the Patton Oswalt  Sketch on how it's worse  To fake cursing  Than actually curse?  No  It's pretty bad  I mean fake cursing 
[02:24:00]  By bad I mean amazing  Yeah  Oh, we gotta check that out  Sounds very funny  You gotta check that out  Euphemisms are terrible  Because they're making you think  Of the word without actually saying it  And they're always too cutesy  And they're never  Oh yeah  He sort of does this rant  Which I can't even repeat  Yeah, it's kind of hard  It's so disconcerting  Paraphrase a comic  I'm a comic and I can't do it  I've butchered other comic jokes  Nah, but the punchline's good  Nice way to squeak that in  Trust me, it's funny  Nice way to squeak that in  Where it's like  Oh, that's where I knew you from  I saw you on  And you got nothing 
[02:24:30]  No, I didn't think she would  Of course you didn't  A really funny man?  The point is  That I am very willing  To throw myself into the mix  But this time  I really was just saying  I can't do it  Oh, okay  Yeah, if people don't recognize you  There's no way to make them recognize you  I was just doing it  To reiterate that you're a comic  And maybe that would have  Helped you out even more  It doesn't help me at all  He's trying to help you  You don't recognize Jim Norton  From his various comedy specials  He's pretty famous  I don't have television  What?  Do you want to have it to you?  Liar  I now own a flat screen, finally 
[02:25:00]  Really?  But it's not hooked up to anything  I sound like such a  Snotty little brat  No!  I don't have television  How long did you go without TV?  I mean by candlelight  And raised keys  Is it?  How long did you go without TV though?  You know, it's been a few years  Wow  I would say  Yeah, probably since  You don't feel like you're missing anything?  Probably since I moved back from Hawaii  Oh, from Lost  Yeah  Did you watch Lost?  Because I forget who was  Who was Saeed?  I don't remember his real name  Oh, Naveen Andrews?  Was he on here?  Yeah, yeah  Oh my god  Oh my god  Did you have to like 
[02:25:30]  Duct tape his mouth?  What did he say?  No, he was here  Oh, we never had him in  No, we had  He was pretty incendiary  Ben  Love him  But he said  I heard that he didn't watch the show  No  He said he didn't watch it  I dragged him to my house  When I had an episode party  And forced him to watch it  With the rest of us  But he was in the fetal position  The whole time  Uncomfortable  Yeah, he doesn't like watching himself  Which I get  I don't really  Why don't you guys like watching yourselves?  There's so many  They come in here  And they just don't want to watch them  It's uncomfortable  You're on a show like Lost  And you don't want to watch?  No, we're proud of the group effort 
[02:26:00]  No, I understand that part of it  They could watch it as a group  But  What goes through your mind  When you're watching yourself  That bothers you?  I don't know  You just have to distance  I mean, I'll watch everything once  I don't necessarily want to watch it  At every film festival  You know, if you take it on the road  You don't want to see it a million times  Once you can have constructive criticism  I feel  But is it only criticism  Or do you kind of enjoy it at all?  You know?  What do you mean?  Like if you're watching a movie that you're in 
[02:26:30]  Are you constantly going  Ah, I could have done that  Or this  Yeah, pretty much  Or can you actually sit back  And just go  Ah, this is a fun movie  I can  It depends on the movie  But yeah, I can do both  Definitely enjoy it as a movie  Did you watch yourself running and taking?  Um  Oh boy  Okay, dude  I will just  Oh, go on  I will take this one on the chin  Yeah  I never claimed to be athletic  When I fell in love with theater 
[02:27:00]  As a young 13 year old girl  And decided to join the local Shakespeare tree  At no point in time did I think  You know, I should probably join the track team  Because someday  I need to be prepared to run  Daintily  With the fluid grace of a gazelle  Right  Right on  It pretty much looks like a frog in a blender  And I'll own it  I'll own it  And I love how people are like  Oh my god, it's so great  How you kept the character so young  And you know  I'm like  Yep, yep 
[02:27:30]  The producers definitely wanted her to be super innocent  Super young  Right  Got, yeah  Check  And you did that run  Like  You did that run  Yes, that was purposeful  That was a  Did you  Do you know there was a montage put together  That was on YouTube and everything  Of just you running from Taken  You know  I  I'm not in the habit of googling myself  Yeah  But an ex-boyfriend was so kind  As to show that to me one evening  Having nothing better to do apparently  Yeah  And I laughed hysterically 
[02:28:00]  It is funny  Because it's not a knock on your acting at all  It's just a funny moment  It's just like  Yeah  We discussed that movie  It's a YouTube clip  We've discussed that movie a lot  On this very program  Oh really?  Yeah  Me and Opie really, really like it  I liked it  Yeah  It had a couple of problems  Jimmy had a couple of issues  But like, you know, the movie  But we have a couple of questions  Why  Why  When you got that Mr. Microphone thing  From your dad  Yeah 
[02:28:30]  You could have been a little nicer  And not ran away when the pony came  Yeah  From the stepfather guy  Did you not know that a pony was coming?  Like, didn't you hear it?  So like, jeez, you know  That kind of  You know, she's kind of an ingrate  For the record  I would like to point out  It was not a pony  It was a horse  Oh, it was a horse  That's right  We always say pony  But it was a horse  Yeah, yeah  But you're kind of like  Ah, screw this little microphone-y thing  Oh, a Freudian symbol  Black stallion  Bye, Dad  The black  Oh, you know what? 
[02:29:00]  I never thought of that  There's a black stallion  That's too much  That's way from Dad  Going to the black stallion  Wow, yeah  That's kind of symbolic  Wow, yeah  Are you in part two?  Because they're doing another part two  Yeah, yeah  We just wrapped a few weeks ago  Oh, you did?  Okay  So it's kind of an inversion of the plot  In this one  My character's parents are taken  And she has to help free them  They made a montage  Man  Yeah, we were to  No, but I mean it's a montage  Not just the one scene  Yeah, it's from more than one  He's really going back there  He's going to point out  That it's more than one  More than one  Oh, yeah 
[02:29:30]  We always talk about the one scene  But someone obsessively  Are you watching it right now?  Oh, yeah  I can't see your screen  Ah, modern technology  Amazing  Sorry  Pop it right on  It's the fourth video that comes up  And you're in  No, really?  Yeah  Sorry  Nothing I accomplish in life  Will precede how badly I run  But if you go to images  There's nothing but beautiful pictures  Of Maggie Grace  Oh, a balm on the wound  Yes  There you go  And in Lockout  You're kidnapped  That's the funny  You're doing it  You play the president's kidnapped daughter 
[02:30:00]  And you're  Who plays the president?  Well, the lead in the movie is Guy Pearce  Okay  And you guys should have him  Oh, Guy Pearce, yeah  He's good  Who is Guy Pearce?  Yeah, he's amazing  Amazing, amazing  Yeah, he's that guy  He was in, uh, Jesus  Australian  Memento  Yeah, Memento  That was it  Yeah, that's the one I was in  Wildly intelligent  Gritty Australian dude  Yeah  Yeah, he was great  And what really drew me to this  Was how funny it is  I mean, it's  Yeah  It really does not take itself seriously at all 
[02:30:30]  Oh, okay  It was an action movie straight up  It's a sci-fi action thriller  But  It's a mouthful  Sci-fi action thriller  Sci-fi action thriller  And what type of prison is this  It's, it's in space  It's called MS-1  And it's a space station  Um, that they've turned into a prison  Is it kind of like, uh, you ever see, uh, Alien 3?  It has those moments  Yeah, it does have those moments  Space prisons  It's just a few sort of homage-y 
[02:31:00]  Oh, cool  Homage moments, yeah  Yeah, space prisons seem very scary  You know  Yeah, because if you get out, what are you going to do?  You're going to float  You don't want to go  Yeah, we got to float  We got to do a lot of, uh, work up on the wires  Which was really fun  Oh, really?  Trapeze artist field trip  Did you go on, like, that vomit comet?  The, uh, that, you know what I'm talking about?  That plane that shows you weightlessness?  Uh, oh  I, I had a girlfriend that got to do the zero gravity thing  Yeah  It sounds amazing  You would do it?  I would love to  I mean, that's something you are not supposed to experience  Yeah, yeah 
[02:31:30]  Like, you're not supposed to know what it feels like to not  Right  You do any of those things?  Adventurous things on your off-time parachuting?  I do  I try to avoid running, which is the best  But I do  I've been bungee jumping in New Zealand  And, um, you know, I love kind of travel off the beaten track  And camping a bit  You get recognized a lot, though, I bet  Airports, you know  Yeah  I would think a lot  Well  From Lost, especially  Well, not, not, not camping  Not  Deer steps up 
[02:32:00]  I mean, a French woman never walked out and recognized you  I'm lost  Um, I loved it  Uh, how awful is it when they tell you you're gonna die in a series?  Like, like, how do they let you know, like, it's your  We're gonna end your character here  Well, they were, they were pretty sensitive about it  It's kind of like a, a bad breakup, you know  You don't text them  Oh, face to face  You don't email  You don't email  They had a lovely conference call from the mainland  And everyone was on it  Oh my god  Hi, uh, Maggie  Yeah, you're there  Yeah  Um, it's, it's not you, it's me 
[02:32:30]  Yeah  What do they say?  That's amazing to me to know that, like, you, cause you're a very popular character  And I think, what, in season two, they, uh, you got shot, right?  Yeah  In the sternum  Yeah, that was pretty bad  That was, that was one of those, like, holy shit, she's, you know  Yeah  Dead moment  Wasn't that when the new crew was coming in and one of them, well, I think that's what it was  It was, like, when, uh, yeah  The new, the second, the second wave of  Oh, I have to watch it again  Right, right, right  I just ran into her the other night  Oh, yeah?  Yeah 
[02:33:00]  I've forgiven her since  So we're cool  She's still like  Michelle and I  Girl like to party  She was DJing  She was doing an excellent job  Oh, okay, cool  So  So you, uh  It's a charity event, dude  What do you think?  Oh, okay  Yeah, party  Yeah, party  It's money for dolphins  Well, I know there are a couple of, you know, the lost girls that got a little bit of a jam up over there in Hawaii one night  Really? The lost girls are lost? Is that  Lost girls maybe, like, you know, tipping a few back, having a little fun  Michelle Rodriguez and the girl that played, uh, and the one that played Libby  Yeah  They just got pulled over  Nothing wrong with that 
[02:33:30]  It happens  We all like a wobbly pop or two every so often  Can't speak to that  Were you, were you sad when you got, uh, were you sad, like, were you, were you, like, it's heartbreaking, right?  When they take you, because, again, it's part of a show, I'm sure  Mm-hmm  What goes through your mind when they're like, all right, look, we have to end this  Are you like  Oh, yeah, it was really, it was really tough  Just to move away from  Yeah  The people I loved  And I'd been there two years, so  You were in a few flash-forwards, though, and stuff like that  Yeah, I know  So, what, did they call you up and go, hey, hey, we got a little flash-forward thing for you 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, yeah  That's cool  You had a great character, too, it's like, and the guy who played your brother, uh, like, what a weird vibe  Yeah, I know, right?  Like, almost an incestuous  Almost  Almost, we, um, definitely committed  It was incestuous  Yeah, I guess, fair enough, it was incestuous  But, uh, we were step-siblings, so  It still wasn't like a Game of Thrones  No, no, no  It was still hot, though  The guy who misses the point, now, it's still really sexy  Even though  Well  Oh, good  Yeah, so, uh, I got the new movie out, coming out 
[02:34:30]  Oh, when is it, uh, when is it open?  Next week  Next week  Lucky, uh, lucky Friday the 13th  Next Friday the 13th  Yeah, very excited  You'll go to the premiere, right?  Yeah  And you'll watch it?  We're heading back to L.A., yep  Um, I'm excited  Did we do this movie justice? I don't think we did  I don't, I don't think so  Who else did?  I don't think you guys did  This one  We're too busy about the running thing  I, I know  I was like, you're too busy  Beating me over the head for my running  Now, who else is in it besides yourself and Guy Pearce?  Um, well, Peter Stormare 
[02:35:00]  I mean, it's, it's really, um  You know, it has kind of a  A throwback quality, I'd say  Like late, early 80s, early 90s  Like a, a fun, fun action movie  Yeah  Um, and we shot it over in, in Belgrade  For quite a few months  So there was a lot of combat training  And that kind of thing  Wow, that's cool  You can handle yourself with weapons and stuff  Is that  Yeah  I like that  And she's the president's daughter  What do you do wrong that you're in prison?  Uh  As the president's daughter  She's kidnapped  Were you kidnapped and they threw you in the prison? 
[02:35:30]  No, she travels up there on a humanitarian mission  They put all the prisoners into  Into stasis  And they put them out  Kind of like the cryogenic freezing in Star Wars  Oh man, and then they get out  But there's some side effects  So not, not all of them fare so well  Uh oh  So you're going up there  To point that out?  To point, you're going up there  To point out the inhumanity of the treatment?  Mm-hmm  Okay  And then look what happens to you  Do-gooders  I know  Boy, these people  Should just stay at home  Mind your own beeswax, I say  So what happens at the end? 
[02:36:00]  Do they get you?  Your moral compass is  Well-suited to radio, sir  Spinning round and round  Amelia Earhart's compass  You didn't hear Jimmy, though  So what happens at the end?  Yeah, do they get you out?  Do they get you out of the end?  I know, just come on  Well, we know they get you out  But it's just the way they do it, I'm sure  I don't know  You never know  Once in a while  Oh, they get her out  Once in a while  They'll pop the lead at the end  And I kind of like that  Gets a little  Do they pop the lead at the end?  No, don't  She's not going to give it away  I'm just ignoring all of these questions  Very good  Do that  That's what every guest should do 
[02:36:30]  The second they walk in this door  Just ignore us  What kind of guys do you like?  Is there any type in particular?  I'm just saying  Do you date typically actors  Or do you try to stay out of the business?  It's a smooth transition  It was  Very smooth  Yeah, I'm very good  That's what I do  I just blurt it out  She's pointing out everything we do  That's good  It's perfect  Movie  Dating  Dating  Dating  Dating  Date movie  So it wasn't smooth there?  Was it inappropriate that the second you sat down  I went, hi, I've been single since April  No, I'm just curious  A lot of people don't date in the business 
[02:37:00]  I mean, I haven't dated an actor in really quite a few years  It's  Good  It's tricky  You know  You get jealous of each other's  Schedules and all that  Oh, okay  And just, you know, I think there's  It's nice to have a bit of mystery  When you come home from work  And it's sort of like that  How was your day moment  Oh, yeah  It's nice when they're sort of like  I have no idea  How you do what you do  You know, it's nice to have  It's not like this commiserating about  You know  Oh, they said they were going to green light it  And then  Millie fell out  You know, it's nice to have a little mystery there 
[02:37:30]  Yeah  It's also really good, too  Because you can kind of bullshit a little bit  Like, if you want to go  If you don't want to see the person  You go, ah, you know what  The AD's having a party  I've got to go to it  And like, if someone else in the business  You don't have to go to that  But they're not in the business  So you're saying it really facilitates lying  Yes  On a grand scale  But something tells me  The stories you get aren't  Well, I was spackling the walls today  On the job site  What?  I would gather you probably  You don't think she goes blue collar?  There's all kinds of stories 
[02:38:00]  You don't go blue collar  We're going blue collar?  No, because I'm just saying like  You don't think she goes blue collar?  I'm not saying snotty thing or anything like that  I'm saying you're very pretty  And I would think, you know  Are we going to like talk about  Evolutionary psychology here?  Where's this going?  That was my  You're a mind reader  I was so getting into that area  What's wrong with the blue collar guys?  Yeah, what's wrong with the blue collar guys?  What's your issue?  What's your hang up?  Well, I was one for many years  And it sucked  And I never scored a Maggie  During those days 
[02:38:30]  Yeah  You're also not a nice person  I'm a wonderful human being  You're not a wonderful human being  No?  No  You're creepy  You drink too much  You shouldn't score a Maggie  Those might be factors to look at  He shouldn't score a Maggie  Is what you're saying?  Yeah, exactly  That's nice  Do you live in Los Angeles?  I am based there, yeah  I prefer New York  But I go out there sometimes for work  You know  When you do Leno?  He does Leno a lot  He doesn't want to brag  So we'll break for him  Humble brag  Hashtag  Humble brag 
[02:39:00]  Don't you love Humble brag?  Yes  Well, I just joined Twitter last week  You did?  You want to get some followers?

That's why I was so anti for so long  It's like, there's no one, no matter how much I respect them  Do I want to know what they had for lunch?  Yeah  I just don't want to know  Yeah, who cares, right?  It's like placebo intimacy  Yeah  Sort of like we're all pretending to be close  By knowing what we had for lunch  Or when we brushed our teeth  We should tweet a  Spot on on this one, yeah  We should tweet a very hot picture of you  And then I'll do the at Maggie Grace  And then you're going to get a lot of followers  Oh, you're going to get a lot of followers  I've got to get Jimmy out of this shot  No, you don't  Too late  Too late  Too late

She doesn't want to come in  But then they sat down  And said  Yeah, maybe she's just shy  Oh no, I just do what I'm told  Oh, they told you the way 
[02:44:30]  Okay  Yeah, they're like  Don't go  Oh, fair enough  Good gosh  Don't feed her to the sharks  Unsupervised  Yeah, but we're not going to be mean  Toss her to the wolves  No  We're a little insecure too  We get all smitten with pretty girls  So we never really  Can you tell  You know  Yeah  We're going to have Jeff Goldblum in here  In a few  And we are going to give him  The how do you do  Wait a minute  Eugene Levy is coming in a few minutes  Physically attacking  What's that?

Boy  I thought we were having a great time too  It's a timey thing  That's good  Yeah  All right, well  Maggie wants to leave  Publicity  All right  Well, Maggie wants to leave  There it is  I got an early squash game  I should take off  Well, I definitely want a picture  Because I got to put it on  Classmates.com  And say that you're my girlfriend  Oh, awesome  That'd be cool  Oh, awesome  Great  And looks down  Idiot 
[02:45:30]  I'm not on Classmates.com  So I won't be able to supervise  Yeah, I hear you  The movie's called Lockout  Next Friday  April 13th  Friday the 13th  It's in theaters  I wish we had a screener copy  Because we would have watched it  And, you know, Maggie from Lost  And she's also in Taken  And Taken 2  Which was just done  But for now  Electric Boogaloo  See Lockout  I like an action movie  That doesn't take itself seriously  Because too many of them do  And that's where they lose me  But it's like  When they're not taking themselves seriously  It's much more enjoyable  Action-packed  Yes, yes  We just gained five followers  Compose a little song  We gained five followers 
[02:46:00]  We're very powerful  Very powerful  By the end of this day  You'll have seven to ten new followers  Maybe we should do like  The vocal trailer for Lockout  You just gained another ten  Lockout  Lockout  In a world  Ah, yeah  Lockout  The daughter of the president's kidnapped  And must be rescued  From a prison environment  So gritty and dirty  You'll vomit  Yeah  Lockout  See it now  See, I would just  Rated M for mature  It's like 1972  See, I would give too much away 
[02:46:30]  The president's daughter's in space  What'll happen?  Join the wacky antics  And they play the music  Do they CGI in this?  Do you have to do any CGI?  Yeah, they created a whole world afterwards  It was amazing  I guess that was an asshole question  No, they sent us to space  Stupid  Actually, we had the budget  It was incredible  God bless Europa  That's fantastic  They actually sent us into space  I'm a fool  Maggie has to go there  Yelling at us  Okay, well thank you  We'll just say 
[02:47:00]  Eugene Levy coming up next  And thank you  Maggie, thanks so much  Maggie Grace on Twitter, everyone  We got Eugene Levy in the studio  Good morning, Eugene  Hi, how you doing?  Pretty good  Now we're on the air  What happened to Maggie Grace?  We had a beautiful woman 
[02:47:30]  Sitting right where you were  And now it's Eugene Levy  I saw her  You met her out there?  I met her out there  Yeah  She's a looker  She is a sweetheart  She's better looking in person  I always knew she was good looking  But seeing her close out  She is really beautiful  People say the same thing about me  That's true  You are very pretty  Very much better looking in person  You are beautiful, sir  And somewhat more pretty  Than people thought  Yes, she's beautiful  I look on film  But on film  You look really good and sexy too  With you it's not as big of a shock  Well, we should possibly discuss this  After the broadcast  I like the way he thinks 
[02:48:00]  Look at that  What a nice head of hair on him  And everything  Jeez, look at you  I've still got the feathers  Yeah, huh?  Yeah  When a lot of people  You probably know  Lost their plumage  You're still the peacock  Well, that's the thing  About like, you know  Going to a high school reunion  Which I've never been to  Incidentally  But  High school  Never had a high school reunion  And I'm devastated by it  I was looking forward to it  You'd have been the popular guy  You'd have been like  Oh, see, he's the guy  That standout star  Well, I think, yeah, that's true 
[02:48:30]  That's not  That's not the sole reason  That I was looking forward to  Going to it  Was for me  But, you know  I mean, it's  You do kind of see  The old kind of ex-football players  That are  You know  Still hanging at the local  Looking a little punchy  And hanging at the local gin mill  Still with their letter jacket on  You know  Going over the old times  That's it  You were the popular guy  Were you?  Yeah  Yeah, what happened?  Yeah  I hope he went to school  Went to a school  And see, this is the problem  Mariah Carey  Also went to his high school 
[02:49:00]  So that knocks his ass  Right out of contention  As being the most famous guy  I think I'm number two  Really?  Mariah Carey went to your high school?  But I'm number two  It might be a drop off  But I am number two  Was she in your class?  I like to tell people that  So they think I'm younger  She's a little younger than  She's a little younger  Oh, I see  Okay  She's got about four, I think  Four years on me  Wow  Does she have a picture up in the hall?  I bet  No  Do you have a trophy in the case?  No  There's no picture of her?  No  I don't know  I haven't been through the halls in a while 
[02:49:30]  She used to work in the supermarket  As a cashier, though  Oh  Down in Greenland  Ball bombs  And boy, does this tie in very nicely  With Reunion  It does  American Reunion  That's your movie  How did you do that?  It's, you know what?  That's why I'm a professional  That was uncanny  It really was  I picked up on that  In a second  I heard Reunion  And went, that's the movie  We've been doing this a long time  American Reunion  I would not have put that together  I know, Eugene  You just sit  And let us drive  Tonight  You're the passenger  Have fun 
[02:50:00]  Hold on  Hold on  Before we get to American Reunion  I do want to say one thing  You're the father in Goon  Yes  That's right  I love that movie  I love that movie  Do you like Goon?  To be honest  I still haven't seen it  I've been on the road  When it opened here  But I'm hopefully going to see it  When I go back to Los Angeles  Quickly  On the weekend  I don't think they had  Big expectations for the movie  How they rolled it out  But people are really liking this movie  Well, I know they love it  They love it in Canada  Yep 
[02:50:30]  Oh man, hockey  They love it in Canada  It's a religion up there  And you were the father  I was Sean William Scott's father in Goon  That's correct  Who's also in American Reunion  That's correct  Yeah, that's true  You know, the greatest character ever  Stifler  But this is a role that Sean is  I think it's really going to shock a lot of people  I think he was really  Yeah  I mean, just being on set with him  I was kind of, you know, blown away  The brutality?  Yeah, it's bloody 
[02:51:00]  Again, it's pretty bloody  And, you know, Lee of Schreiber  You know, also a great, great performance  Great actor  He was in Taking Woodstock  The film I was in as well  Yeah  Taking Woodstock  Who else was in that?  That wasn't Demetri Martin, was it?  Yeah  Oh, it was Demetri  Oh, okay  I still haven't seen that  No, I've saw parts of it  I gotta see that movie  Yeah  I saw Goo, though  I just want to acknowledge that  If you were there  Were you there at the time?  Were you there?  Did you do the 60s thing?  Oh, man  Right, remember?  I love the fact that he's looking at you two 
[02:51:30]  Like it's possible  You went to Woodstock  You know, how happy that makes me  I remember  Yeah  Yeah  We went to the 90s version  Free Love  It's, yeah  The marijuana  You kind of had to be there  It's, yeah  But it was a lovely, lovely movie  Yeah  Yeah, I remember Hendrix closing out the show  It was way past my bedtime  I think I was  I was actually  I remember watching the news accounts of it  I was a child  But I do remember 
[02:52:00]  What years were you on SCTV?  When did we do it?  What years were you there?  We started in 76  And we finished in 84  76, wow  And we had  We were down one year  The better part of one year  So it was like seven years  And Candy was there the whole time with you?  Oh, yeah  We were  No, John  John was not there the last year  And he was not there the, oh boy 
[02:52:30]  Was it the, now I can't remember  The second last year  Oh, one of the half hour years  I think he was not there for  A couple of years there  John or maybe Catherine  Kind of, you know  Didn't come in for it  But pretty much 90% of the time  Yeah, that had a hell of a cult following  Back then  Oh, it was a great show  It was, you know  The inmates running the asylum  It was, it was just great fun 
[02:53:00]  It was the most fun  I think I've, I've, you know  Had in my career  We just had a lot of laughs  We were just writing  What we thought was funny  And doing it  And, you know  We were shooting up in Toronto  We were shooting in Edmonton, Alberta  We had no idea  People were even watching the show  When we first started it  Because, you know  We would just go in tape  And then go home and have dinner  I mean, it was just  It wasn't like, you know  Saturday Night Live  Where you've got New York City 
[02:53:30]  At your feet, you know  We were just doing a job  And going home  And eventually  Over the, over the  In the, in the second year  We started  When it, when it got syndicated  To about 40 American cities  Yeah  We started getting, you know  Reviews and things  From American papers  Like Dallas  Texas  Yeah  You know, Boston  And we're going  Wow, people are actually  Watching the show  People are watching the show  It was a type of comedy  That we just weren't getting here 
[02:54:00]  It was really out there  I think it  I think you really needed  A good kind of  Off-center  Sense of humor  To get it  Well, that's good  And those are the fans  Of the show  And those really  Were the people  That we were kind of  Gearing the show for  Because we weren't  We weren't making excuses  We weren't apologizing  For anything  We were just  And there was nobody  To tell us what to do  Yeah  And also  The movies you've done 
[02:54:30]  With Christopher Guest  That's another type of  Genre of movie  That people  People that find that funny  Have a different  Sense of humor  Well, again  You're  We're kind of given  Carte Blanche  By the studio  Castle Rock  Is, you know  Who we did the movies for  And I guess  Warner's distributed  But  Those movies were  You know  As long as the  Budget  As long as we didn't  Go over budget 
[02:55:00]  They gave you  You know  Whatever it was  The first  Like Guffman  Was maybe  Five million dollars  Or something  It was just a really  Low budget movie  As long as you don't  Go over five  You can do what you want  We're, you know  We're not going to  Interfere creatively  Right, yeah  I don't think I've ever  Seen a more  Sad character  Than yours in  Best in show  Where  Just  With the  Yeah  The wife  That would just  Yeah  Every guy  She bumped into  Yes  Had had sex with her 
[02:55:30]  At some point  And Eugene's character  Is trying to play it off  Like, oh, okay  Well, don't you  And it's just blatant  They had  Unbelievable sex together  And you're trying to  Just play it off  Well, that was the funny thing  Was they would  She would bump into  These old guys  That she used to  You know  Have sex with  And then they would  Just talk about  How great the sex was  In front of me  That was terrible  And you know  He was just too nice  A guy to say anything  So he just kind of  Stood there and waited  Until they were finished  Talking about it  Horribly  Jerry Fleck, yes 
[02:56:00]  Jerry Fleck  That's right  And you guys had  A lot of latitude  As far as what  The characters said  Script-wise  Yeah, it was all  They were improvised movies  We, Chris and I  Kind of really wrote  A pretty fine-tuned outline  You know  We, scene by scene  We kind of laid out  What, you know  The exposition and story  And everything else  We even included some jokes  If we thought of  Some jokes for the character  We would kind of  Write it in  But not so much 
[02:56:30]  As dialogue  We just kind of  Wrote the  Just wrote it in  But we didn't write it out  As kind of dialogue  So they were kind of  Screenplays without dialogue  Really  And the great fun was  That people actually just  And there was no rehearsal  So when you get  You know  You get on set  You get on camera  And that's the first time  You actually realize  What's going on  First time you hear  What's coming out  Of the other characters  Before Curb Your Enthusiasm  Did it  You guys did it  Well, you know  Curb 
[02:57:00]  You know  The reason it's taken  So long to  Even come out  With a fifth  Movie for Chris  And myself  Is that now  Everybody's kind of  Aping the style  It's  Right  You know  Everybody's now doing  A fake documentary  Thing, right  Every television show  Has now got this  Fake documentary  Talking to camera  You know  And it's kind of a lame  You know  The way it's done now  Is just  You know  Just  Homogenized  Down to a point  Where it just becomes  Like what is it 
[02:57:30]  Yeah  So you know  There's nothing  Kind of unique  About doing  It feels formulaic  Now  Like that's just  The way comedy goes  So there's  It doesn't  You know  So we're still  Kind of looking  To try and  Figure out how  Whatever we do next  Is you know  Going to be  Kind of different  And  The ensemble cast  Too is  Amazing  At doing  That type of  Movie and humor  You got like  Fred Willard  Is  Hysterical  Parker Posey  In  Best in show 
[02:58:00]  Was  Unbelievably funny  Well Parker's  The only  Really the only  Actress  I think  In the group  Who did not  Come out of  An improvisational  Background  Really  Everybody else  Is  Pretty  You know  Had some  Pretty good  Training  I mean  Myself  Catherine  Fred Willard  Linda Cash  Was in  Waiting for  Guffman  All Second  City  People  Jennifer  Coolidge  Came out  Of  The  Grandlings  And 
[02:58:30]  It's  You know  These people  Are really  Good  I mean  It's a  Great cast  For doing  This kind  Of work  Because  You think  If you're  Just going  To improvise  Just throw  Throw in  A line  And try  And get  A laugh  And you  Know  That's  What it  Is  It's  Not  It's  Not a  Robin  Williams  Kind of  Improvisation  Right  Yeah  We're talking  About here  It's  It's  Kind of  Knowing  How to  Keep  Everything  Funny  And yet  You know  Organic  To the  Character  It's all  Got to  Come out  Of the  Character  The  Audience  Has to  Care  About  Your  Character  Otherwise  It's  Just a 
[02:59:00]  Series  Of  Jokes  That's  Why  You  Can't  Just  Put  Anybody  In that  Situation  And it's  Going to  Be a  Good  Funny  Improv  Movie  You  Kind of  Have to  Know  You know  How to  Get your  Laughs  Keep the  Scene  Moving  And when  To  Shut up  Yeah  That  Collection  Of  People  On  Those  Movies  It's  Always  Been  Historic  It's  A  Great  Great  Great  Group  So  Were  You  Right  Like  I  Want  We  Want  The  Scene  To  Start  Here  And  The  Purpose  Of  The  Scene  Is  To  Get  You  And  Your  Wife  To  The  Supermarket  And  Then  You  Just  Kind of  Flow  In  And  Out  Do  You  Guys  Put 
[02:59:30]  A  Time  Limit  On  It  Or  Do  You  Just  Feel  How  It's  Going  No  Just  Feel  How  It's  Going  Once  The  Information  Comes  Out  In  The  Scene  And  People  Are  Just  Kind  Of  Going  Off  And  Riffing  On  Something  Then  They  Those  Movies  Is  That  You  Know  It's  It's  A  Documentary  Format  So  You  You  Have 
[03:00:00]  A  Lot  Of  Editing  Options  That  You  Can  Use  To  Kind  Of  Sew  The  Comedy  Pieces  Together  You  Know  In  A  Documentary  You  Can  You  Can  Use  Jump  Cuts  You  Can  Go  To  You  Know  Somebody  Talking  To  Camera  You  Can  Cut  Out  At  Any  Time  And  Then  Kind  Of  Cut  Back  In  It's  Not  A  Narrative  So  To  Speak  So  So  You  Really  The  Great  Thing  About  That  Form  Is  That  You  Can  Cut  Out  At  Any  Time  Cut  Back  In  Go  To  Somebody  Talking 
[03:00:30]  To  Camera  You  Can  Jump  Cut  Somebody  Three  Times  And  Just  Go  From  One  Funny  Thing  To  Another  Right  Yeah  And  That  Was  A  Great  Thing  About  The  Format  But  You  Know  Now  It's  Now  It's  You  Know  Everybody's  Kind  Of  Doing  It  But  They're  Doing  It  In  A  Scripted  Kind  Of  Way  So  It  Doesn't  Tell  You  It  Just  Doesn't  Look  You  Know  It's  Scripted  And  You  Know  They're  Not  Really  Making  It  Up  And  It's  The  Forced  Awkwardness  That's  Not  Like  The  Deadpan  Stare  To  Camera  The  Thing  About  Being  Improvised  Doing  Doing  Doing  Doing  An  Improvised  Movie 
[03:01:00]  Or  Just  Improvising  On  Camera  Is  You  Know  There's  Not  You  You  Know  It's  Not  Scripted  Because  You  You  Can  Everybody's  Kind  Of  You  Know  Everyone's  Getting  It  Yeah  When  You're  Doing  Dialogue  With  Another  Actor  In  The  Movie  They  Aren't  Quite  Sure  Where  You're  Going  And  You  Could  See  Their  Reaction  To  It  Sometimes  They  Want  To  Laugh  And  Even  Though  You  Don't  See  An 
[03:01:30]  Inkling  Of  A  Smile  You  Can  See  Behind  That  Face  Somebody  Wants  To  Crack  Up  I  Had  To  In  The  First  Movie  Waiting  For  Guffman  It  Was  You  Know  I  Had  To  Anybody  Else  That  Was  In  The  Scene  Get  Down  On  My  Hands  And  Knees  And  Crawl  Off  The  Set  So  The  Camera  Wouldn't  See  Me  So  I  Wouldn't  Stop  The  Scene 
[03:02:00]  You  Know  I  Didn't  Want  To  Laugh  On  Camera  But  I  Just  Couldn't  Help  Myself  Disappear  Behind  Somebody  You  Know  And  Then  Crawl  Off  The  Set  And  Start  Laughing  Say  Okay  Well  That  Was  It  I  Couldn't  Help  Well  Says  He's  Going  He's  Crowing  About  It  Crowing  About  Saying  That  Better  Than  The  Original  Could  Be  I  Think  Here's  The  Thing  You  Know  I  Always  Have  A  Soft  Spot  For 
[03:02:30]  The  First  American  Pie  Because  It  Was  Just  Such  A  Great  Experience  American  Reunion  Honestly  I  Think  Could  Be  The  Funniest  Of  The  Four  Movies  And  It  Was  Handled  Really  Really  Well  By  The  Writer  Directors  These  Young  Guys  Who  Were  In  High  School  When  American  Pie  Actually  Came  Out  And  They  Just  Had  Such  An  Effect  On  Them  And  It  Really  Influenced  Their  Writing  And  Their  Writing  Style  And  They  Couldn't  Wait  To  Get  On  Board  This 
[03:03:00]  Thing  And  They  Did  Such  A  Great  Job  Of  Creating  A  Movie  With  A  Great  Story  Moving  All  The  Characters  In  A  Direction  That  Kept  The  Whole  Thing  Moving  Forward  You  Because  When I  First  Heard  They  Were  Doing  Another  One  I  Thought  Boy  How  Are  They  Going  To  Stretch  This  Into  A  Fourth  Installment  And  They  They  Did  They  Just  They  Wow  I  Get  To  Go  On  A  Bit  Of  A  Ride  My  Character  Which  Is  Great  They  Finally  Let  Me  Out  Of  The  House 
[03:03:30]  And  You  Know  So  Everything  Is  Kind  Of  And  The  Premise  Is  Fantastic  You  Know  I  Mean  It  Is  A  High  School  Reunion  And  It  There's  A  Lot  Of  Implication  There  You  Know  Current  Relationships  Hooking  Up  With  Old  Relationships  And  It's  It's  Really  Great  It's  A  Very  Very  Funny  Movie  When  You're  Doing  A  Movie  If  You  See  A  Joke  That  You  Don't  Like  It  Just  Stinks  I  Mean  You're  Kind  Of  In  A  Position  Where  You  Can  At  At  Least  Have  A  Certain  Of  Do  You  Do  The  Joke  Anyway  Or  Will  You  Actually  Somehow  Go  To  The  Writer  The  Director  Can  I  Can 
[03:04:00]  I  Swap  This  Out  Yeah  You're  Comfortable  Doing  That  No  I  Go  To  The  Writer  Director  Oh  Yeah  Yeah  No  I  Would  Say  I  Can  Can  We  Come  Up  With  Something  Else  Here  Cause  This  Is  You  Know  I  Think  It's  Kind  Of  Lame  And  Usually  They  Just  I  I  I  I  Had  A  Lot  Of  Flexibility  In  Terms  Of  Doing  That  Or  Reworking  A  Scene  Again  In  This  Movie  There's  A  Lot  Of  Improvisation  They  Encouraged  You  To  Improvise  They  Encourage  You  To  Go  Off  Script 
[03:04:30]  So  There  Was  The  Scenes  I  Do  With  Jason  Biggs  As  My  Son  You  Know  There's  A  Lot  Of  Freewheeling  Improvisation  That  Kind  Of  Goes  In  There  That  I  Enjoy  And  Got  To  Work  With  Jennifer  Coolidge  You  Know  Stifler's  Mom  That's  Kind  Of  A  Very  Exciting  Thing  For  Me  In  This  Movie  So  Yeah  It's  Kind  Of  Good  But  I  I  Remember  Doing  One  I  Think  There  Was  One  Maybe  The  Second 
[03:05:00]  American  Pie  And  There  Was  A  Scene  As  Speech  That  I  Really  Didn't  Care  For  I  Remember  Going  Up  To  The  Director  And  Saying  Can  We  Change  This  Speech  I  Don't  Really  Care  For  It  He  Said  Oh  I  Thought  That  Was  Funny  That's  A  Funny  Line  I  Said  Well  Not  To  Me  It's  Not  That  Funny  To  Me  He  Said  Well  Oh  Okay  Well  You  Want  To  Change  It  All  Right  Well  Why  Don't  You  Change  It  But  Do  Me  A  Favor  Do 
[03:05:30]  Your  Version  And  Then  Just  For  Fun  Do  It  The  Way  It's  Written  And  I  Said  I  For  Safety  And  You  Know  That  You  Can  Put  In  The  Vault  And  Then  You  Know  And  I  Don't  Have  The  Combination  So  You  Were  Honest  With  And  You  Said  I  Can't  Do  That  Yeah  I  Said  I  Can't  I  Just  Don't  Think  It's  A  Funny  Line  I  Just  You  Know  Whatever  But  I  Think  That  Was  The  Only  Time  That  It  Really  Got  To  Work  It  Really  Got 
[03:06:00]  Got  To  A  Point  Of  You  Know  I  Don't  Think  He  Walked  Away  Saying  That  But  Maybe  But  No  There  There's  A  Lot  Of  Improvisation  In  This  And  Not  That  We  Needed  To  Because  I  Think  It  Was  A  Really  Funny  Script  And  It  Has  All  The  Same  Sensibility  As  The  First  American  Pie  And  It  Does  Have  Over  And  Above  All  The  Sex  And  There  Is  There  Is  There  There  There 
[03:06:30]  Is  Something  In  This  Movie  That  You  Probably  Would  Not  Expect  To  See  So  The  Envelope  Kind  Of  Continues  To  Get  Pushed  Here  But  It  Does  Have  A  Really  Nostalgic  Vibe  To  It  And  It  Even  Has  Some  Kind  Of  Little  Sentimental  Scenes  That  They  Weren't  Afraid  To  Kind  Of  Go  There  So  It  Really 
[03:07:00]  Is  A  Very  Funny  But  A  Very  Kind  Of  Rich  Great  Movie  That  Completely  Stands  On  Its  Own  It  Is  Not  Like  You  Need  To  See  The  Other  Three  Movies  In  Order  To  Find  This  Movie  Funny  It  Really  Kind  Of  Stands  Up  On  Its  Own  Everybody  Knows  What  A  High  School  Reunion  Is  Even  If  You  Know  Or  Don't  Know  The  Characters  You're  You're  You're  You're  Still  Going  To  Have  A  Lot  Of  Laughs  Who's  The  I  Know  It's  A  Very  Tough  Question  But  Who  Would  You  Say  Is  The  Best  Improver  You  Ever  Worked  With  And  Maybe  One  Of  Three  Amazing  Improvers  I  Really  Good  Improv  I  Say  This

[03:09:30]  Else  Is  All  Off  The  Top  Of  His  Head  He  Was  Part  Of  SETV  Yeah  Marty  Was  On  SETV  The  Last  Two  Years  Yeah  Yeah  I  Remember  I remember  Watching  SETV  Years  Ago  And  Then  Right  Afterwards  It  Would  Be  SETV  Into  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  That  Was  Very  Close  That  Was  Born  Back 
[03:10:00]  Then  That  Was  Born  Yeah  That  Was  Right  After  Right  After  SETV  That  Came  On  What  A  Great  Block  In  Time  That  Was  Yeah  Well  I'm  Glad  It  Didn't  Come  On  Before  SETV  That  Would  Have  Put  You  In  A  Whole  Different  Frame  Of  Mind  I  Think  You  Know  You  Been  Looking  At  Saying  That  Not  Funny  Did  You  Guys  Know  John  Candy  Was  Such  A  Versatile  Actor  I  Don't  Think  A lot  Of  People  Knew  That  Just  Based  On  What  He  Did  Comedy  Wise  With  SCTV  And  What  But 
[03:10:30]  He  Was  A  Very  Good  Actor  John  Was  A  Actually  Great  Actor  And  He  Was  A  Very  Much  Underrated  Actor  And  I  Knew  When  I  Was  Working  With  John  On  The  Show  On  Our  Television  Show  Of  The  Work  That  He  Did  On  Some  Of  The  Characters  He  Would  Just  Go  Really  Deep  Into  A  Character  Just  Strange  Insane  Stuff  But  He  Was  Deep  In  The  Character  And  So  Focused  I 
[03:11:00]  Remember  Doing  My  Movie  With  Him  Way  Early  On  1980  I  Think  It  Was  Called  Going  Berserk  And  It  It's  A  Movie  With  Some  Very  Funny  Scenes  No  Story  Necessarily  And  John  Had  A  Scene  To  Do  In  There  That  That  Was  Really  Kind  Of  A  Tough  Scene  It  Was  You  Know  He  Had  To  Be  Kind  Of  Sitting  On  The  Bank  By  It  Must  Have  Been  A  Lake 
[03:11:30]  Or  Something  And  He's  He's  You  Know  Supposed  To  Be  Kind  Of  Masturbating  Can  We  Say  That  Oh  Certainly  It's  Taking  Far  Too  Long  To  Get  To  It  You  And  And  And  A  Cruise  Ship  Thank  You  I  Know  You  And  Universal  And  A  Cruise  Ship  Goes  By  And  Kind  Of  Sees  Him  You  Know  In  The  Process  Of  Doing  What  He's  Doing  And  Then  He  Had  That  Scene  And  I  Remember  Saying  To  I  Said  John  Why  Why 
[03:12:00]  Don't  You  Just  Go  Up  And  See  If  You  Can  Change  The  Scene  Because  That  Would  Have  Been  My  Instinct  Right  I  Can't  Do  This  Maybe  We  Can  Change  It  And  John  Said  No  That's  What  That's  What's  Written  My  Job  Is  I've  Got  To  Do  It  I've  Got  To  Find  A  Way  Of  Doing  It  You  Know  And  It  Was  And  I  Was  Going  Wow  I  Guess  That's  What  Acting  Is  Really  Acting  And  John  Was  I  Mean  Really  How  About  Only  The  Lonely  He  Was  Very  Good  In  Oh  And  Trains  Planes  And  Automobiles  Which  I  Think  Is  I  Mean  I  Loved  Uncle  Buck 
[03:12:30]  But  I  Think  Trains  And  Planes  Is  Just  About  The  Greatest  John  Candy  Performance  At  The  End  Of  That  When  He's  Giving  That  Little  Speech  About  Himself  And  It's  Serious  Yeah  No  It's  Heartbreaking  And  It's  It's  Really  Close  To  Who  He  Was  To  You  Know  It  It  Was  Really  Kind  Of  Revealing  It  Reminded  Me  Of  When  You  Watch  Earlier  Jonathan  Winters  Work  Where  He's  Being  Serious  Serious  Actor  Yeah  It  Had  That  Same  Vibe  To  It  Well  How  About  JFK  His  Little  Oh 
[03:13:00]  Right  Yeah  Yeah  That's  Right  Oh  My  I  Forgot  About  That  And  A  Good  Day  To  You  Sir  Yeah  I  Forgot  About  That  John  Was  Really  Really  A  Great  Actor  And  Just  So  Much  Fun  To  Work  And  Of  Of  Of  The  One  Yeah  3D  With  Woody  And  Tongue  I  Did  The  Schmange  Brothers  With  John  I  Did  I

[03:14:00]  Never  You  Know  We  Sometimes  Would  Get  Criticized  In  Canada  Because  I  Remember  When  Our  Show  Went  Off  The  Air  My  Hometown  Paper  Hamilton  Ontario  Up  There  Had  A  Headline  SETV  Good  Riddance  After  Seven  Years  And  It  Was  Like  Weird  And  Our  Show  Was  Like  I  Thought  It  Was  A  Pretty  Good  Show  Certainly  For  Canada  And  I  Finally  Got  To  Talk  To  The  Reporter  Who  Wrote  That  And  And  I  Said  How  What  Were  You  Thinking  What

[03:19:00]  He's  Racing  The  Sal  What  Did  You  Learn  On  The  Opie  Anthony  Show  Today  Honestly  I  Wasn't  Listening  That  Much  What  The  Fuck  Do  The  Interns  Do  Here  I  I  I  Went  To  The  The  I  I  I  I  I  I  I 
[03:19:30]  I  I  I 
[03:20:00]  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  He's attracted to his anchovy eyebrows.  Don't get mad at me because you didn't listen to the show.  He's wearing the same glasses, isn't he?  Like, what did you learn is an easy game to play.  All you have to do is listen to the show when it's happening in the room right next to you.  It's not tough.  I learned Eric's supporting by wearing a hoodie.  Let's go to the phones.  Wait, do you want the sweeper?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Put the sweeper on. 
[03:20:30]  Here comes...  What did we learn?  What did we learn?  You betcha.  Todd in New Jersey, what did you learn today on the Opie and Anthony show?  Hey, boys.  I learned today that sweater boy cutie Jim has managed to work the word formulaic into his sentence for the second time this week.  Are you keeping track of how many times Jim says formulaic? 
[03:21:00]  It just stands out.  It's not a commonly used word.  Thank you, Todd.  And that's something that people maybe are learning a little more listening to the Opie and Anthony show is that, you know, you can figure out some vocabulary.  Donnie in Queens, what did you learn on today's Opie and Anthony show?  I learned on today's show that no matter how beautiful you may be, you may not be playing on your phone when you're supposed to be entering the studio.  You're right, Donnie.  You're right, Roland.  It wasn't her fault. 
[03:21:30]  You dodged a bullet today, though, my friend.  You know you did.  It wasn't her fault, though.  So what happened today was that Maggie Grace, who is in Lost and she's going to be in the new movie Lock Up, Lock Down?  Where's she?  Give me a fucking water at it.  Lock something or other.  She was in studio today.  She's throwing water bottles at interns.  She was in studio today and she was outside waiting for a publicist.  I guess the story was her publicist told her to wait.  No, the studio, not the personal.  The studio told her to wait for a publicist. 
[03:22:00]  She was ready to come in and it was like a pickle.  It was a pickle.  Because it's like, go in, wait, don't go in.  And then she saw the guys going like this and then she goes, oh, I mean, it's like, they saw me.  The last person I heard refer to a problem as a pickle was Smalls in the Sandlot.  I love that movie.  You're killing me, Smalls.  The Grey Hambino.  Roland used to say that last year.  He used to say that to management and to other people on the floor.  When they'd say something to him, he'd just go, you're killing me, Smalls. 
[03:22:30]  You're killing me.  But yeah, Roland was in two seconds away.  I'd say, actually, I'll give her five seconds.  She was five seconds away from being canceled on the spot and you got nervous.  But why did you think I left right away?  What do you mean you left right away?  Like, oh, then I just left.  Yeah, I got it.  And then afterwards, what did I do?  You brought her in.  No, then after the interview, I said, fuck you, fuck you.  Yeah, he goes, yeah, it wasn't her fault.  And they go, okay, yeah, it's okay, Roland.  And he goes, yeah, next time don't be fucking assholes.  Suck my dick is what Roland said to Opie and Anthony. 
[03:23:00]  Because you did panic for a second.  I did.  I got scared.  I got very, very scared.  Jim in Pennsylvania, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  What's going on, Sam?  I learned today that Anthony Acumia is a cracker.  Anthony Acumia is a cracker.  He is.  We got a call from the lovely Florine, who's called in before.  One of Anthony's favorite black people.  And yeah, she said Anthony is a cracker.  She said a lot of other things.  She's looking for a job right now.  So if anybody's got a job for Florine, I don't know, find her. 
[03:23:30]  John in Westchester, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show today?  I learned that the interns still ruined the show.  How could they not be listening, John?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I called the other day, and I had that observation.  I'm still going to have that observation.  Every time they ruin this shit show, I'm going to call and call them out on it.  Yeah.  Have a good day now.  Thank you, John.  And you should call in every time.  I also learned today that drugs can make you famous because we've got another YouTube video 
[03:24:00]  that we were talking about today of a kid who's getting all doped up.  This time she was like 15 or something, but she was getting all doped up at the dentist's  office, and her mom just thought it would be hilarious to video her and put her on YouTube.  It's amazing.  And now she's a YouTube star.  Drugs, they make you famous.  BJ and PA, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  I learned that children of the 80s remember Woodstock somehow.  Yeah, the original Woodstock.  Opie and Anthony really need to drop this whole child of the 80s thing because they thought 
[03:24:30]  that it made them, I guess, sound a little younger when they said, well, we weren't actually  old enough to be at Woodstock, but they both remember the live news reports happening on  that day.  Like, I was a kid when Woodstock in the 90s happened.  I was actually born in the 80s.  I don't know if you can still call that a child of the 80s.  I would think so.  But they specifically have said they're children of the 80s, and today they instead went the 
[03:25:00]  other route and said that they remember the original Woodstock.  Gene in Nebraska, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  I learned that Florine doesn't know a character from Milwaukee.  That's true.  Florine needs to get her racial slurs in check.  Travis in Kentucky, what did you learn today on the Opie and Anthony show?  I learned that Eugene Levy has a heart out for Stifler's mom.  Yeah!  Eugene Levy and Roland, you saw the new American Reunion movie.  What did you think? 
[03:25:30]  I loved it.  You did?  I'm on par with the first one.  You enjoyed it that much?  I'm going to pay to see it again on Friday.  You are?  Yeah, I love it.  It's very exciting.  Stifler was hilarious.  Was he?  He ruled.  Eugene Levy on the show today said that Stifler was one of the greatest characters in any  movie ever.  Yeah, you see him working in a corporate environment going, what's up, fuckfaces?  Oh, that's good.  I love it.  Tony, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  Today I learned IBM stands for eyeball men.  Yes, you did.  That was when we were talking about the roles of men and women in the workplace. 
[03:26:00]  Adam in Kansas City, what did you learn on today's Opie and Anthony show?  I learned that if Anthony disagrees with Jimmy, he won't step up to the plate against him.  He just pipes down.  Well...  It was obvious on the Muhammad Ali subject, like he wasn't on the same page as him, but  he just kind of kept quiet.  Well, I mean, he definitely let Jim have the argument with the phone caller without supporting  the caller.  But, I mean, I guess in the end, he kind of, he fought back a little bit. 
[03:26:30]  I don't know if he went for a full force argument, but he did, uh, he voiced his opinion, I think.  Very true.  I just kind of expected a little bit more out of the, the entertainer in him.  Yeah.  I mean, well, also you got to realize that Anthony knows that he can't just start flipping  out on Jim because number one, he likes Jim.  And number two, that happened at like seven o'clock this morning.  He's still got two hours of show to do with the guy.  True story.  True story.  I didn't want them to hate each other. 
[03:27:00]  I just thought it would have been pretty funny to watch them, uh, two geniuses go  at it.  It absolutely would have been.  Thank you, Adam.  Thank you.  And look who's on the phone right now.  Francine.  She's been on hold for an hour.  Is she still there?  Francine.  What's up?  How are you?  Do you, I don't know.  Does everybody remember Francine?  She used to intern for this show.  She's been on the after show.  She got into a huge fight with Troy one time.  Uh, what are some of the other memories of you on the opening?  She got into a fight with Louis Black over abortion. 
[03:27:30]  Right.  And, uh, yeah, yeah.  Francine used to do the news.  I sure did.  You haven't been on in a long time.  I know.  I miss you guys.  Like, a lot of really bad stuff happened.  Like, I lost my job again.  Why?  How?  I don't know.  How am I supposed to know?  You just had, you had just gotten this job the last time we talked to you on the after  show?  Um, no.  I got a job in, like, 2008.  Oh.  And they fired you? 
[03:28:00]  Um, no.  It was a contracted position, so I basically lost the contract.  So I wasn't really getting fired.  The contract ended and they didn't extend it.  That's kind of like, I mean, they might as well have fired you, though.  They obviously were like, yeah, we could extend the contract, but we're not going to.  Yeah, something like that.  Was your performance lackluster?  Probably.  Yeah?  Not so good at it.  What were you doing?  Um, I used to do a lot of video and television editing.  And, but then that's not your strong suit? 
[03:28:30]  Um, it wasn't a lot to do.  So I just did what I had to do and went home every day.  That's, that's that work ethic like our guy Paul here has, and it's getting him nowhere  as well.  Um, so what are you up to?  What are you up to now?  Um, I can't say what I'm up to now, but I do work.  You can't say what you're doing, though?  Yeah.  What's it kind of like?  Can you give us any hints?  Are you on Crazies?  Um, it's reached now.  What are you, crazy?  Oh my God.  I'm Catholic. 
[03:29:00]  I can't do stuff like that.  You wouldn't, if times got tough, you wouldn't whore yourself out?  If times got really tough?  No, no, no.  Honestly, I really wish I could because I'd make a lot of money.  Lots of people do want to have sex with me, and lots of people do want to give me money  for sex.  Who?  But, we mean who?  Men in general.  This is exactly, Francine, last time you were in here and you were talking like this, this  is exactly what got Troy so upset.  Do you remember?  Yeah, because Troy's a faggot.  Wow.  Whoa.  Jesus. 
[03:29:30]  He obviously likes buttholes.  He likes men's buttholes, you think?  Men's hairy buttholes, the turds coming out.  That's what he likes.  You like, whoa.  And that's okay, all right?  If that's what you like, that's what you like.  How are you talking about Troy's judge's job?  My marriage is going to be legal all over the country pretty soon, and you guys can be  happy and adopt all the babies you want.  Who's you guys?  You think I'm gay too?  No, Troy.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  I know you're a straight fan.  When I sit in your lap, you don't complain.  That's right, and I become fully erect, don't I? 
[03:30:00]  Yes, you do, and so does Timmy.  So, what are you doing at your new job?  You could call it retail sales.  Okay, so you work at a store?  Yeah.  Okay, but what are you selling?  Women's clothing.  Is it Victoria's Secret again?  No, oh my God, thank God, no.  You used to work at Victoria's Secret.  Yeah, and I used to help really nasty looking women get into braves and panties. 
[03:30:30]  It was really disgusting.  Well, I'm glad you're not doing that anymore.  All right, so it sounds like is life good right now, or is life not good?  Life is better.  It's not as good as it used to be.  I don't, like, get to do manicures and pedicures on Saturdays and Sundays.  That's what you were doing?  Yes, and I don't get to do a lot of the retail therapy I used to enjoy.  I don't get to come to New York every couple of weeks like I used to, and I don't get to  go on vacation every two years. 
[03:31:00]  But, yeah, I know, it's rough.  Well, I mean, your internship was with the Opie and Anthony show.  Do you know how long ago it was?  I don't know.  It was 11 years ago.  Oh, my God, that's a long time ago.  And right now you're working in a store.  I mean, I don't understand.  You're supposed to have success stories coming out of this internship program.  We're looking for new interns, Francine.  We need for you to be doing better to encourage people to take part in this program. 
[03:31:30]  Um, I would encourage anyone who wants to do the internship to really do it.  Even with Troy here?  Troy's gay, and I don't want to talk about him anymore.  He can go fucking lick balls in some bathrooms.  I don't care about it.  Wow.  Um, okay.  So, are you seeing anybody?  Um, no.  I'm not seeing anybody.  My boyfriend left me.  Why'd he leave you?  Um, a lot of problems and lots of stuff. 
[03:32:00]  I don't want to talk about.  But one of the biggest things is when I lost my job, I lost my apartment.  And I don't think he was.  You lost your job.  You lost your apartment.  What happened?  I don't think he really wanted to be with me anymore.  He saw that I was unstable and crazy.  You went nuts.  Yeah.  I think he really figured it out.  Uh, Francine, Troy just walked in.  I don't care about Troy.  Can we not talk about him?  Unstable and crazy.  Yeah.  No fucking figure. 
[03:32:30]  Did you hear when she, she was just, we were just talking about what she could do for  a living.  Right.  Because she lost her job.  She's working at a clothes store now.  That's great.  And I asked her about if she would just have the, think about whoring herself out a little  bit.  And she said her morals don't allow her to, but she wishes that she could because she  knows she could be successful because there are lots of guys that want to have sex with  her and lots of guys that want to give her money for sex.  Gotta fucking be kidding me.  You remember, Francine?  Of course I remember.  She thinks her fucking pussy's made of gold.  Like, fuck you, you dumb bitch. 
[03:33:00]  Whoa.  Yeah.  Okay.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Troy, you need to watch your mouth.  Oh, fuck you.  Don't fuck yourself.  I don't need to watch shit.  Fuck you.  You walk in, you know, you walk in this fucking place and you think everybody needs to fucking  bow down to you and suck your fucking ass.  Fuck you.  Whoa.  Yeah.  You do.  Like, what the fuck?  What makes you think your fucking pussy's gold?  Like, what's so good about your fucking pussy?  It's so good.  What makes you think that saying the F word makes you sound so hilarious?  I don't think I'm hilarious. 
[03:33:30]  I'm just asking you a question.  Francine.  I'm just talking to you what you sound like.  You just, you, no, you were just, you called me a name, so it made me pissed off.  So I'm fucking in here talking to you about it.  Is Troy upset that you didn't give it up to him when you were in that day?  No, first of all, I sat on Troy's lap and he just acted like I did something bizarre  and crazy.  Because, because, because, no.  I called him out on the gayness of the act that he did.  She thinks I'm gay because I don't fucking kiss her dumb ass.  That's what it is. 
[03:34:00]  Is that what it is?  Well, she comes in, she comes in and she's like, hey, and she's so used to every guy being  like, ooh, thinking they're going to be able to fuck her.  And she comes over to me and like, I don't give a fuck about this dumb bitch or her dumb  fucking pussy.  And, and she just, she didn't know what the fuck to do with me because I didn't give  a shit.  I was just like, get the fuck out of here.  And then you're fucking calling me names.  Go fuck yourself.  You're making up shit.  First of all.  Did you not?  Yo, yo, yo, yo, shut the fuck up.  Whoa, whoa. 
[03:34:30]  Did you not?  Yo, did you not try to come and sit in my lap and fucking try to flirt with me?  And you didn't react to you?  Exactly.  Because I don't give a fuck about your dumb pussy.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Sam Kennison.  You got to give Francine a chance too.  It's a fucking dumb bitch.  Call me a fucking faggot because I don't want, I don't kiss her ass like everybody else.  Fuck you.  Well, gayness is legal now.  So you need to just accept what you are.  You got to be gay because you don't like me. 
[03:35:00]  Accept what you are.  Accept what you are.  Listen, if I was gay, if I was gay, I'd have no problem telling you, yes, I am gay.  I suck cock.  But I do not suck cock.  Yes, you do.  How the fuck would you know?  How the fuck would you know?  You're fucking, you work at a clothing store.  How would you fucking know anything?  I could smell the semen coming out of your breath.  Oh, it's funny.  You're fucking so funny.  I suck cock too.  Huh?  Because I suck cock too.  Okay?  Did you smell, did you smell dried semen on his breath? 
[03:35:30]  I smell semen on his breath.  And I could see the stains on his pants.  He sucks a lot of cock.  Troy, if she smelled it, she smelled it.  That's just such a fucking stupid, stupid idiot thing to fucking say.  That's just such a stupid thing to say.  You're just, you're just so pissed off.  You're pissed off that I don't give a fuck about you.  You're so pissed off that fucking dudes kiss your ass all the time because they want  your fucking pussy.  And they don't, they don't like what's attached to the pussy.  They just want to use your hole so they can fucking ejaculate. 
[03:36:00]  Why don't you understand that?  You're a dumb, you're a dumb fucking twat.  Whoa.  Francine, is that true?  Or are guys attracted to your mind as well?  Um, I think people think I'm very smart and I think they're attracted to me because  I'm very politically oriented and I make a lot of really good Facebook comments.  That's what I think guys like about me.  They want, they want to use your orifice.  They want to use your orifice to ejaculate it.  What do they, what, what do they like about Troy, Francine?  Like his round, juicy butthole. 
[03:36:30]  And they like all the perks that come out after they're finished with him because he's just  so good at what he does.  Which is what?  A lot of shit, a lot of shit comes out of his ass and his mouth all the time.  Oh.  So, here you go, Troy, in your face.  Oh, you got me.  Hey, what's, what's Troy good at?  You're so gay, Troy.  I don't even want to talk to you anymore.  Get him off the phone or I'm going to hang up.  I don't want to talk to you.  You're such a loser.  What were you saying?  You said he was good at something.  Now go hang yourself.  You're a loser. 
[03:37:00]  I can, I totally get the loser vibe from you.  I totally get the loser vibe from you.  I totally get that.  My comments are witty on Facebook.  Is that what your comments are like?  Go hang yourself.  No, I don't want to.  I don't want to.  Go fucking yourself.  I want to stay on this earth and terrorize you as long as I fucking can.  What do you think of that?  I live in D.C., so I don't know how you're going to do that.  Good luck.  Well, when you call in, when you call in, I'm going to call you a dumb fucking twat.  And I'm going to tell you that guys just want to use you, your holes, to ejaculate. 
[03:37:30]  They don't give a fuck about what's attached to it because what's attached to it is so  fucking stupid and brainless.  So brainless and stupid.  You're so funny.  Don't kill yourself.  Don't kill yourself.  Is that what your Facebook comments are like?  Is that why guys think you're so great on Facebook because your comments are that fucking  witty?  You dumb fucking twat.  You're a big loser.  Is that all you got?  Is that all you got?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wanted to call in to talk about something. 
[03:38:00]  I can't talk to him anymore.  He's such a douchebag.  Oh, that hurts.  What did you want to talk about?  Basically, I also do another side job and I sell LSAT test preparations for a company.  So I just wanted to give a shout out to Rhodes Prep.  And if anybody needs to take the LSAT, and I know a lot of your listeners are probably  going to be future lawyers, they could go on to Rhodes Prep dot com.  Shut up.  Shut the fuck up, you dumb bitch. 
[03:38:30]  Stupid bitch.  Nobody gives a fuck about you.  How many fucking cares?  She's trying to plug the thing.  I'm trying to do something across the air here and you're totally ruining it.  Fuck you.  She's trying to plug her business.  Who cares?  First of all, I helped you come out of the closet, so you need to thank me.  I'm not out of the closet.  You're not yet?  Okay, and Obama's going to legalize your lifestyle.  Great.  So there you go.  Dude, listen, calling me, I could give a fuck if you call me gay.  I don't, that doesn't hurt my feelings.  Yeah.  Sam.  Yeah.  So, um, just tell your little diva friend to shut up because I need to get this across 
[03:39:00]  the air because this will make me more than any, and it'll make me happy.  Are you gay, Troy?  Because she said, I'm not gay, but if she wants to call me gay, I don't give a fuck.  Would you be comfortable with it if you were?  Yeah, I don't give a fuck.  Oh.  If I wanted to suck cock, I would say I want to suck cock.  I don't.  Hey, listen, I have gay friends.  It's all good.  Okay, good.  And I'm agreeing with you.  It is all good.  You're right.  It's all good.  So wait, wait.  So then when she's right, though, then why wouldn't you want her to sit on your lap?  Because she's a dumb fucking idiot. 
[03:39:30]  And she thinks that every guy wants to fuck her.  Oh.  Every guy does.  Every guy does.  Are you kidding?  Like, listen, like, listen to how fucking arrogant and stupid that is.  Every straight guy, everybody wants to fuck me.  Do you understand?  Do you understand?  Okay, do you understand?  Do you understand that guys will fuck pretty much anything?  You understand that, right?  Like.  Yeah, including you.  You're so funny.  Can you do something else besides a gay joke?  It's true.  Seriously, like, try something else.  You have to know something else.  It is merging on homophobia. 
[03:40:00]  It's just like, shut the fuck up about the gay shit.  Like, come up with a better joke.  First of all, I'm not homophobic.  I'm for everybody's life.  Good.  So if I was gay, why would you have a problem with it?  I don't have a problem with it.  I'm just calling you on your gays.  You don't want me to sit on your lap because you're gay.  Are you kidding me?  Are you that fucking arrogant that you think you're that hot?  So, Francine, you think every guy you're saying that you've encountered.  Every straight guy would want to, definitely wants to have sex with you.  If you're in a small room with me, why not? 
[03:40:30]  Yes, to just use your hole to drop a fucking load.  Like, what?  You don't understand.  Like, you're not that fucking special.  You don't understand.  You're not that fucking special.  Like, guys don't like what's attached to the hole.  They just want to use an orifice to ejaculate with.  That's it.  That's all you're good for.  And that's all you keep saying.  Because that's the truth, and you know it.  You're like, guys want to fuck me.  Guys want to fuck me.  You guys want to fuck me.  Guys don't give a fuck about your brain or anything you have attached to the hole. 
[03:41:00]  I'm really smart.  I'm really smart.  I'm really pretty.  Listen to how fucking dumb she sounds.  She sounds like a stupid fucking idiot.  I'm really smart.  And I'm really pretty.  And every guy wants to fuck me.  Like, you just sound like such a fucking idiot.  You sound.  You deserve.  You fucking deserve every fucking load.  And to be dumped inside of you.  And to be fucking dissed.  And thrown out like the fucking garbage.  And you too. 
[03:41:30]  And you too.  You deserve all of that.  You got me.  And I'm sure.  I'm sure it'll happen.  I'm sure I'm going to get loads dumped in me like you.  You too, honey.  You deserve all of C-men in the world.  Just like me.  Thank you.  That hurt my face.  You're such a loser.  Hey, listen.  Sam.  So can I just say it once a time?  Because I'm so finished with Troy.  He needs to go jump off a cliff.  Or like.  Do like Selma and Louise.  His other gay counterparts.  Just hold hands in hand. 
[03:42:00]  And just drive off a cliff.  Because he's got no future.  Anthony just texted in.  And said.  He would indeed.  Have relations with Francine.  That's Anthony Coomey.  And he wrote.  He wrote.  Tell Troy Zimmerman.  I'd fuck her.  And.  And Anthony.  Anthony.  I'm going to tell you this, dude.  I agree with you 100%.  I would totally fuck this dumb bitch.  Right.  And I'd drop my fucking load.  And I'd be like.  Fuck you, bitch.  Get the fuck out of my face.  That's all you're fucking good for. 
[03:42:30]  Is removing the fucking semen from my balls.  Fuck you.  Get out of here.  Oh.  And I'd kick her dumb ass out of the car.  In the car.  You wouldn't bring it.  Fuck no.  Oh.  So, Francine.  What was the name of the.  LSAT thing?  It's called.  Hey, wait.  Hang on.  Let her.  Let her plug her LSATs.  Yeah.  Because I've been.  Staying with this fucking gay guy.  For how long now?  Being a.  Oh, another gay joke.  Keep them coming.  They're really funny.  I know they're funny.  And you know they're true.  That's why they're hilarious. 
[03:43:00]  And it's okay.  I've sucked just as much cock as you have.  And I've taken it up the butthole too.  And it's okay.  It's all good.  Nobody cares anymore.  Right.  You're going to get all.  You're right.  Yeah, you're right.  Nobody cares.  It's fine.  It will be legal.  Okay.  It will be legal.  It's legal.  If I wanted to get fucked in my butt, it's legal.  Sam.  Sam.  Let me get my thing out because I'm so tired of Troy.  Okay.  We're tired.  We're tired of you.  So it's Roast Prep.  It's R-H-O-T-E-S.  Oh, that's obnoxious. 
[03:43:30]  It is obnoxious.  It is.  It's very immature.  It's very immature.  And I'm trying to do something.  I'll let you say your thing.  And you need to let me say my thing now.  Yeah.  So it's Roast Prep.  Oh, jeez.  Well, I'm going to guess that people on your show probably spell better than me.  So you can figure it out.  There are going to be classes from bosses.  Bruce. 
[03:44:00]  All right.  All right.  Where are the classes, Francine?  Real quick.  He's going to have a class.  Let her tell the classes.  Huh?  It's not fair.  Okay.  What's the website?  The website is...  Bruce!  Rolling.  Enough.  What's the website?  I don't want to do this all day.  How was Bruce last night?  It was awesome.  Yeah.  Was it better than the other night?  Yeah, it was better.  How do you think MSG is going to be compared to this one?  Phenomenal.  Really?  How many times does he play an MSG? 
[03:44:30]  Two nights.  Only two nights.  And it's sold out?  You know.  I don't know if you guys...  Francine was trying to say something.  Oh.  No, but Roland saw Bruce Springsteen last night.  No, I know.  And the fans love you, Sam.  I appreciate you saying that.  You told me that a lot of people were talking about you.  That's very flattering.  I mean...  Is that Roland?  Yeah, that's Roland.  Hey, Roland.  Okay.  I love you.  Let her get the website out, so that way we could...  What was the best song that he played last night?  Let her get the website out.  Racing the Street. 
[03:45:00]  Why Racing the Street?  It's just a classic old song that makes...  It's amazing.  He doesn't play that one much?  Nope.  So when was the last time you played it?  Francine?  Last tour.  Yeah.  And do people, like, bootleggers, like, collect the times that he played that?  Every time.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  I don't know if these guys are going to let you get it out.  Was it a good...  And it was a good performance of it?  One of the best.  So that was the curveball last night that everybody was surprised?  That and Trapped was a major curveball.  Why Trapped?  He hasn't done that in the Encore in a long time, so...  Like how long? 
[03:45:30]  A tour...  Two tours?  Like a tour and a half ago.  Oh, really?  Yes, everybody freaked out.  And he hasn't done it at all on this tour at all?  Nope.  That's just because it was Jersey.  Jersey, six premieres last night.  Wow.  And how many times did he play in Jersey?  Two nights.  Oh, three nights.  He's coming back in May.  Are you going to that one?  Yeah.  Nice.  All right, Chris.  Okay, so can I do it now?  Just say the name of the website.  We'll be done.  There's no way you're going to get any details about this out.  Troy is far too bitter.  Oh, he's gay. 
[03:46:00]  He sucks cock.  He takes in the ass.  It's okay.  It's going to be legal.  It's going to be legal.  Yeah, that's good for you and your people.  Anyways, let me go.  I'll just hope that everybody can hear you.  It's Rhodes Pass.  So anyway, Bruce.  Yeah.  Thank you, Francine.  It's always a pleasure.  You're such a sweetheart.  You're a dumb twat.  I love you straight man.  You're a dumb twat.  You think so?  She's a fucking dumb twat.  I would fuck you.  Don't get fucked up.  I would fuck you. 
[03:46:30]  I would fuck you.  But I would hate fuck you.  I would hate fuck you like you've never been hate fucked in your life.  I'm a straight woman and I would never fuck a gay man.  And that's all I have to say.  Oh, that hurts.  She got the last blow in.  There she goes.  That was it, huh?  She has a blow.  It is always good, though, hearing from Francine, hearing what she's up to.  She's so, she's such a fucking dingbat, isn't she?  You think so?  Look, I've fucked a lot of cock.  And I know what it's like to smell cock on your breath. 
[03:47:00]  Like, that's her insult to me.  Yeah.  I mean, everybody.  David in Virginia.  No.  Mike in California.  Yeah.  Today I learned I want to put my dick in Francine's mouth to shut her fucking face.  She's nothing but a series of holes.  Yes.  Thank you.  Oh, and in Texas.  Randy in Pennsylvania.  People gotta be on their phones.  Randy.  Hey, Sam. 
[03:47:30]  What's going on, my man?  What up?  Hey, brother.  I just wanted to say, Troy, you're the fucking man, dude.  Now, Francine is a cop-sucking slut.  Oh, you didn't have to be rude about it.  Kyle in Boston.  Hey, if she's the one that shows up when you Google Francine Opie and Anthony, I can see  why Jim likes her.  She looks like a fucking tranny.  That's the biggest jaw I've ever seen on a broad in my life.  That's unkind.  Ryan Washington.  Hey, Sam.  I just wanted to say that if Francine eats a man, well, then why doesn't she just fucking 
[03:48:00]  smart up and talk about the reason that Troy ended up getting a nose job?  Because I couldn't breathe?  Yeah, that's not a very good argument for Francine.  James in South Carolina.  Hey, Sam.  I just want to know, is Troy really sitting there talking about somebody else being a diva  and how they want all his fucking attention when he's the one who thinks he is Mr. Immaculate?  Okay, hold on.  What's this guy's name?  James. 
[03:48:30]  James, where did you get that information from?  Where have I ever said that, that I'm Mr. Immaculate?  See, every time we ever hear them talking about you on the real show, they're saying, you know,  you're the one who makes them dress a certain way because you talk about the way they dress.  You come in, you talk about people being fat.  You talk about people doing this and that.  So is that being a diva?  Yeah.  Yes, you're a fucking diva.  Hold on, James, because I would prefer to wear a nice button-down shirt as opposed to a black T-shirt 
[03:49:00]  like everybody else does.  And you know what?  That's your choice.  Yeah.  So what's the problem?  But they can goof on me for it, and they do.  They goof on me for that.  And if somebody's fat, I'm going to call them out and be like, dude, you should probably  try to get in shape.  How does that affect you if they're happy with their lifestyle?  Then all they have to do is go, you know what, dude?  I prefer being fat.  Shut up.  Fuck you.  All right.  John in Alabama.  Stupid argument.  John.  Yes.  What up?  We call girls like Francine cum dumpsters where I'm from. 
[03:49:30]  Absolutely.  You agree?  We call them across the globe, buddy.  Stumpy in Kentucky.  I got two things here.  Number one, I'd rather have sex with Francine's toilet abortion than Francine's.  She did have an abortion in the toilet.  I know.  It's nice to dress up nice.  Fuck, I drive a truck for a living, and all these guys walk around in tank tops and cut  off shorts.  Just nice.  It makes you look better, and you get more money.  There you go.  Exactly.  If she sits on your pants, you got to get your pants tested.  Mooney in Texas. 
[03:50:00]  Hey, Sam.  What I learned today is Troy has a secret love for Francine like the Jews love the Nazis.  Maybe it's something that hates fucking you were talking about.  Dude, I would absolutely fuck her.  Absolutely.  But I would hate fuck her like she's never been hate fucked.  You're not in love with her.  I, fuck no.  Oh.  Dan, I mean Ted in Chicago.  Hey, uh, while describing herself, she mentioned that she was smart and up on politics.  And then almost immediately after that, she mentioned that soon Obama was going to make 
[03:50:30]  it legal for Troy to get married.  Troy lives in New York fucking city, so it is legal for her to get married.  So I wouldn't even dump a load of cum in that stupid fucking bitch because she might get  pregnant and procreate and pollute the earth with more stupid cunts.  Could be.  Good point.  Dan in Oklahoma.  Uh, I learned that Troy has cum breath because Francine said so.  Possibility.  I mean, Francine said she smelled it. 
[03:51:00]  Uh, all right.  Steve in Pennsylvania.  They keep coming, dude.  Steve in Pennsylvania.  How you doing, Sam?  You know, you know, Troy's right.  You know, that stupid cunt that needs to get skull fucked so bad.  Wow.  And get her face planted right in the fucking pillow.  And she keeps saying, she said that she took it in the ass.  Yep.  So what?  You know, like the other guy said, she lives in New York City, so it's already legal.  That's true.  It's just funny because, I mean, does she that unaware of the way men really are? 
[03:51:30]  That men just want to fuck a whole?  Do you know what I mean?  Like, are you that disconnected with how, what reality is?  Like, guys just want to fuck anything.  Like, you're nothing special because guys want to fuck you.  It's true.  I mean, the standards are low.  So, and I will tell you this, what I learned today was that if you want the audience to  get back on your side, just start smashing women because they love a good woman bashing.  I mean, especially a dumb fucking twat like that. 
[03:52:00]  Yeah.  Oh, this is an interesting one.  John in South Carolina.  Hey, what's up?  What's up, dude?  Well, I learned today, man, was Troy didn't get a nose job.  He got a nose reduction.  That way he could swallow all his boyfriend's cuck.  Was that so you could get deeper on the shaft?  No.  It's not that he's wrong?  I've never, I've never sucked a cock.  Would you?  No.  It depends who it was.  Who?  Because I said The Rock, Roland said The Rock, Bruce Springs, Roland said a few different  people.  It would have to be like Paul McCartney. 
[03:52:30]  And would you do it for free or for nachos?  For free.  Roland said he would suck The Rock off for nachos.  With jalapenos.  He has to have jalapenos.  Deluxe nachos.  Yeah, extra cheese on two of the balls.  David in Israel.  Hi, Ashan.  How are you?  Very well, David.  Troy, I want to say that you, based on how the boys have beaten you up, you've happened  in the past come across like a douche and thinking about yourself too much, but today  you redeemed yourself.  Every bitch that I've ever worked with has thought they were hot. 
[03:53:00]  And I've actually found more pleasure in turning them down than trying to go after them because  they think they're hot shit.  The fact that you don't respond to them and put them in their place.  She didn't know what to do because she's never had that before.  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  Do you know what?  Stephen Brooklyn?  Yeah, I learned today that if Troy wasn't a hater, he would never get on the radio.  How do you mean?  The only thing that comes in there is to hate on He Rock, and now he runs in there to hate  on this girl.  That's not necessarily true.  But Troy's a good motivator, though.  We were just talking about Bobo yesterday.  Well, tell me that you didn't walk at least briskly to run into the studio to start yelling 
[03:53:30]  at Francine.  Well, because she called me a faggot, dude.  Like, why wouldn't I want to come in and defend her?  Okay, well, that's...  You listen to me on the radio all the time.  All you do is yell at people.  Well, that's fine.  And that's your opinion.  You're totally entitled to your opinion.  And that's fine.  But I'm telling you...  I'm telling you...  Dude, can you shut up for a second?  I came in here to defend myself.  Stop, dog.  Dog.  Francine, you're a cunt.  Did you call him dog?  I don't know what he's talking about.  I'm going to hang up on him.  I mean, she's...  Like, you're going to call in and say something to me like that. 
[03:54:00]  Like, at least sound a little bit intelligent.  I mean, Troy's got a short fuse.  Yeah.  And he doesn't mind sharing that on the air.  But in this scenario...  And I've come in.  I've talked music before on the air.  I've talked...  I mean...  Francine started it this time.  Yeah.  She talked shit, and I fucking came in to defend myself.  Why wouldn't I want to come into the studio and defend myself?  Yeah, well...  And, you know, you're like...  I come across...  Please tell me what I have done on the air where I have come across, like, a pompous,  fucking asshole.  Tell me what I did. 
[03:54:30]  You don't want to open that up to them.  Well, I mean, other than say, oh, some people on the staff are fat, and I try to dress decent.  Who'd you say that about?  We've just gone over this.  I don't remember.  Of course you remember.  We have new listeners every 15 minutes.  Who did you say that about?  I have said that before that people on the show that have a weight problem are wrong.  Roland, you don't mind me saying that, right?  You're a motivator.  And Eric has a weight problem.  Yeah.  That's all...  That's what I've said.  Right.  And then you could say to me, well, you...  Your appearance sucks like this.  And then why doesn't anybody go, well... 
[03:55:00]  You know, you guys are fucking haters on Troy.  Roland, he's a motivator?  No, no, no, no, no, that just hurts.  What does?  No.  He is a motivator.  He's motivating you?  Yeah, he's been motivated.  In what way?  I'm cutting back on the last shit.  Yeah?  Are you dieting?  Are you getting yourself into shape?  Yeah.  You are?  Yeah.  We've tried it before, but that was because we were pushing it.  Yeah.  You've pushed it on yourself.  I did.  And you're actually going to go through this?  Enough, enough.  What's the diet?  You're south-beaching?  You're nagling?  What are you doing? 
[03:55:30]  It's called a...  It's like a body-by-vi diet.  Body-by-vi?  Yeah, V-I.  Who's Vi?  I don't know.  The person who created it.  Steve Vi, the guitar player.  Yeah, it's like you do two shakes and one meal.  Where'd you find his diet?  A friend of mine, a couple buddies, they lost a lot of weight on it.  Worked for them.  Yeah, they lost 100 pounds in 90 days.  And that's what you're going to do?  I'm doing it.  Like yesterday, for two booth shows, got the VIP backstage.  They had all fried foods and booze free.  Yeah.  I took the water.  Eric, what do you think of this whole argument that went on? 
[03:56:00]  Uh, look, Francine's very nice.  Uh, she's always been sweet to me over the years, but I do agree with Troy.  Because she came in with the ego.  Yeah.  She said...  She's...  But she's...  Look, she's always had that and we've always played up to that sort of as her character.  Yeah.  You know, that was really what she is.  See, like what we've been doing is kind of getting her to say stuff like that.  Like, you know, we're nice and you get her to...  Seating into it.  And then where Troy comes in and she's not used to this type of treatment.  Troy just walked in and went, no, bullshit. 
[03:56:30]  Yeah.  And pointed a finger in her face.  That's fucking horse shit.  I just...  I hate, hate girls like that.  And I'm at an age now where I just don't have to fucking put up with that.  You know, when you're a teenager, you're in your early 20s, you want pussy, you have  to go through the motions and deal with that fucking horse shit.  You have to take a dumb fucking cunt like that out to dinner, wine and diner, just so  you can fucking use her hole to ejaculate it.  You don't like it.  At the age that I'm at now?  Yeah.  Fuck no, dude. 
[03:57:00]  I am not dealing with that bullshit.  And I'll tell you, that's what's interesting about going to strip clubs is because the  roles are completely, like, reversed.  Because all these girls are coming up to you.  That's why guys like strip clubs.  Sure.  Because now the girls are actually coming up to you and trying to gain your...  They want something from you.  Right.  Now, we all know it's just a goof.  Like, it's all a game.  They're just trying to get money.  But still...  But a lot of guys do go in there and think that now that these chicks are really into  them.  Because guys aren't used to what girls are used to. 
[03:57:30]  Right.  Like, guys aren't used to the fact...  Because I was thinking about this.  Because, like, we were talking about it on the air earlier this week.  We went to a strip club and I went, you know, with some of the guys around here, just  down the block.  And, you know, lap dances, for me, were free.  Everybody was paying for them.  So I was just like, yeah, let's do another one.  And people kept coming over.  Girls kept coming over.  And all I could think about was, this is what it is for a decent-looking girl.  Anybody who's decent or better-looking than that, as long as you're a decent, good-looking 
[03:58:00]  whatever, guys are coming up to you wherever you go.  Like, there is never an instance where there's not a guy who would fuck you.  Right.  And guys will fuck anything.  Yeah.  They will fuck anything.  And it's...  And a smart girl that's pretty will understand.  They've been through it a couple times where they've been burned.  And they understand, look, guys will just want to fucking nut.  They don't really like me.  They're just after...  They're being nice to me because this is what they want from me. 
[03:58:30]  Yeah.  A dumb twat like this is confused and thinks that guys really like her as a human being.  And she becomes the guy at the strip club who thinks that the girls are into him.  Exactly.  And she has...  How old is she?  She's...  I mean, she's got to be 30 at this...  She's 30-something, right?  I mean, dude, she hasn't figured this out yet.  Yeah, she's got to be in her early 30s.  I think she is at 30.  Yeah.  But yeah, I mean, she's the guy at the strip club who's just going to be giving all his money out.  She's here.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'll do another...  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, a private room? 
[03:59:00]  Sure.  And all of a sudden, they're left with no money.  And then they're surprised when the girl doesn't want to talk to him anymore.  Exactly.  But I was speaking about my bachelor party because the day after...  I mean, there were a few drinks passed around.  You know, people had some drinks.  And the day after, Opie, who was there, you know, as I said, some of the guys were there.  Troy, you couldn't go because you were recovering.  And Eric, you couldn't go because of WrestleMania.  Yeah.  But Opie had a couple drinks.  Not a lot.  But I guess he hadn't drank in a while because the next day he was looking after his son. 
[03:59:30]  And he said it was the first time since his son was born that he's been hung over.  And he had his son all day long.  So it was torture for him.  But what I realized...  I don't know if you guys...  He's doing a SoundCloud thing.  Like, Troy, you've been on SoundCloud for a while.  I'm on SoundCloud.  Yep.  Opie Radio is now on SoundCloud.  And instead of podcasting, he's just been posting these, like, three-minute things.  He hasn't even talked about it on the show, I don't think.  But I saw he posted something while he was looking after his son the day after the bachelor party. 
[04:00:00]  And his son's on the tape.  This is the first time Opie's son has been broadcast.  Nobody's heard his son in the public forum.  Yeah.  Are you going to do it?  I said, why not let this break on after Opie and Anthony live?  Wow.  This is big.  You know?  And his son is saying, yeah, yeah.  You can hear him in the background.  So I said, it's public.  It's on the Opie Radio SoundCloud page.  Right.  It's out there.  And he's going to be bringing this to the public.  Why don't I help him bring this one step further to the public and break the story? 
[04:00:30]  Let after Opie and Anthony live be the first show where we broadcast his son's words.  Yeah.  Should we do it?  Fuck yeah.  As long as Opie's cool with it.  It's on his SoundCloud.  Okay.  I just don't want to get in trouble for what the fuck you're doing.  No, I don't think we'll get in trouble.  You can check out his SoundCloud yourself.  You can turn off the radio.  And play it there.  And just go to SoundCloud slash Opie Radio.  Or you can leave the radio on because here it is.  What's happening, everybody?  Yeah.  Yeah.  My son says, yeah. 
[04:01:00]  I've been babysitting him all day.  He's killing me because I'm very, very hungover.  I think I wrote on Twitter, hell on earth is being very hungover with a kid that likes to wake up super early.  And it's full of energy.  Anyway, had a great time at Jim Norton last night.  God, Jimmy's killing it.  He's going to be taping his special in Cleveland on April 28th. 
[04:01:30]  And he's more than ready.  It was nice to see a bunch of you at the show last night.  Afterwards, I met up with a bachelor party and went to a strip club.  Although they like to be called gentleman's clubs nowadays, which I don't understand because if your goal is to make comsies in your pants, maybe they shouldn't be calling it a gentleman's club. 
[04:02:00]  Yeah, right?  You understand that one?  Also, I did the big Easter egg hunt yesterday with my son and my family out there on Long Island.  Really, really good times.  And in our family, we still call it Easter eggs.  We still call it the Easter egg hunt.  We still call it the Easter bunny.  None of this politically correct crap like spring bunnies, spring eggs, spring spheres. 
[04:02:30]  I love Opie's getting these relevant political points across while I don't know what his son is trying to communicate.  His son is trying to communicate something.  His son's probably saying, get out of the bathroom.  I have to go.  Yeah.  The other thing I hope, I hope that at some point within the next few months, his son all of a sudden starts saying the word comsies because his dad is broadcasting this in front of him.  But there it is.  It's Opie Jr. and his first words on the radio here on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Eric, were you disappointed that you missed the bachelor party? 
[04:03:00]  Well, yeah, because I only found out just before I was supposed to leave for my trip.  Yeah.  But, yeah, it was a little disappointing.  I would have liked to have gone.  Did you partake in any of the drinks that you mentioned?  No, no, no.  I don't drink.  But that night you didn't at all?  No, I don't drink any night.  Why would I drink that night?  Because it's your bachelor party.  I don't drink, though.  So?  I mean, it's not like I drink sometimes.  I don't drink ever.  That's me.  All right.  I forgot to ask you the most important question about your WrestleMania trip while we still have some time. 
[04:03:30]  What'd you bring me?  I brought you some stuff.  You brought me something?  Yeah, but we don't have time.  What do you mean?  Just give me the thing.  No.  I didn't know you brought me something.  Yeah, I told you I brought you some stuff.  I forget.  What did you bring me?  I felt bad that I was missing your bachelor party there, so I got you some stuff.  It's good stuff?  I think it's good stuff.  Oh, man.  Can we do it tomorrow, then?  I guess we'll have to.  We don't have time today?  I've been trying to give it to you all week, but, you know.  Why didn't you say something?  You can interrupt me for that.  In the last two days, you know, Troy's pretty much taken up all the airtime, so I couldn't... 
[04:04:00]  Sometimes I've got to give it to him.  No.  No, I understand.  It's just there was no time to present that opportunity.  If I wanted the airtime back, Troy, I would take it back.  You don't have anything to apologize.  Just tell me to leave.  I don't think you'd be here if you don't let me here.  Speaking of airtime, Jim Norton's getting some airtime.  Tonight, he's going to be on Hannity on Fox News.  I guess he'll be part of the Great American Panel or whatever it's called.  I don't know, but tune in to Hannity.  What time is that on?  Nine?  Nine o'clock.  Nine Eastern on Fox News.  And Troy, aside from you putting out that mixtape that I saw you put out, which you get  all that on TroyKwan.com, right? 
[04:04:30]  Yep.  Q-U-A-N.  Yeah.  Free download for my new mixtape.  What do you...  What's the DJ schedule?  I'm DJing this Saturday at Spin NYC here in New York City.  It's an awesome spot.  Come out to it.  And then I'm at 675 Bar every Monday.  Well, you gained some fans today.  Just raises my blood pressure through the fucking roof.  We don't have time, Eric, for some little presents?  No, we have to go.  Best of Ron and Fez is coming up.  God damn it!  Stay tuned for that.  We'll be back with more of this tomorrow.  Goodbye.  Yes, I am gay.  I suck cock.
