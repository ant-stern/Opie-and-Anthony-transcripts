<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  It began with a scathing critique of the ABC reality show "Splash," focusing on the hilariously awful diving performances of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Louie Anderson.  The hosts speculated on Abdul-Jabbar's motivations, suggesting a desperate need for the spotlight and possibly financial difficulties, referencing a past in-studio interview where his publicist scolded him.  Louie Anderson's performance was similarly mocked, highlighting his physical struggles and emotional reactions.  The segment continued with a detailed, and crude, analysis of Joey Lawrence's hair, with speculation that it was a tattooed stubble.  Other celebrities on "Splash," along with D.L. Hughley and Andy Dick on "Dancing with the Stars," were also discussed, often with vulgar commentary focusing on the physical attributes of female celebrities.  The hosts used profanity throughout this segment.

Next, the show shifted to a discussion of a female gospel singer’s appearance on *Dancing with the Stars*, again marked by highly offensive descriptions of her body.  This transitioned into a lengthy and controversial conversation about Joe Rogan's views on transgender women in MMA, featuring derogatory language towards transgender individuals from both Rogan (via a played clip) and the hosts.  Anthony's struggles with his new GoPro provided a brief comedic respite.  The hosts also negatively commented on Yoko Ono, mentioned the anniversary of her marriage to John Lennon, and expressed ambivalence about their upcoming move to Sirius XM's Indie channel, criticizing their assigned time slot and the difficulty for listeners to find the show.  They also satirized Harvey Levin's TMZ Twitter questions.

A significant portion of the show focused on the frustrating logistics of an upcoming radio event, marked by angry outbursts from Opie and Anthony due to poor internal communication and the refusal of an audio technician ("Gary") to participate. This was punctuated by a guest appearance from sports memorabilia expert Brandon Steiner, who brought items to give away to listeners and shared anecdotes about acquiring collectibles, including a humorous story about Kurt Schilling.  Several listener call-ins involving sports trivia, featuring enthusiastic participation and humorous incorrect answers, were a major part of this segment.  Opie also discussed his weight loss and a funny incident involving his wife.  The hosts and Steiner discussed Steiner’s book, "You Gotta Have Balls."

The conversation with Steiner continued, detailing Steiner Sports' business, including specific memorabilia (Babe Ruth's iPad, Thurman Munson's autograph), collaborations (Jay-Z), and the creation of authenticated baseball stadium dirt.  They discussed NCAA controversies, specifically the Penn State and Notre Dame scandals, athlete image rights (Ed O'Bannon case), and the 30th anniversary of Jim Valvano's death and the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary about him.  More listener trivia segments, with prizes like baseball dirt maps and coasters,  featured arguments and accusations of lying.  Steiner shared anecdotes about various athletes, including negative experiences with Curt Schilling and Randy Johnson, and a humorous encounter with Randy Johnson's son. The conversation also touched on the Steubenville rape case, expressing strong opinions about the case and punishments, as well as gun control and welfare policies, expressing frustration and anger over government spending.  Mike Francesa made a brief call.

Finally, Jim Norton hosted a segment following Opie and Anthony’s departure.  The hosts briefly discussed the high cost of living and lack of political representation before transitioning to Norton's segment.  This segment consisted primarily of listener calls covering a wide range of personal issues: the cost of healthy food, GoPro troubleshooting, marital problems (including infidelity and communication issues), dealing with a mother's relapse, temptation to cheat while expecting a child, navigating divorce, and relationship challenges with differing religious beliefs. Norton provided advice and commentary, often with crude humor and sexual innuendo. The segment concluded with repeated advertisements for Adam & Eve, offering a discount code.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Gregorio!  Antonio!  Not enough of this palaver!  Let's get the show on the road!  Off and running!  Hey!  I want to start. There we are. I want to start.  We've got to save Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  Oh my god.  We have to.  I grew up watching Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. 
[00:00:30]  He's one of the greatest athletes of our time, certainly.  Oh boy.  He's one of the greatest, if not the greatest NBA player of all time.  Yeah.  He needs to be saved.  What the fuck is he doing?  Who are the people around him saying this is a good idea to look like a complete fool on national TV?  He's on the ABC hit show, Splash.  Which is another reality show where they do things and you get votes for how well you do and there's judges and experts. 
[00:01:00]  Right, right.  And then they vote people off.  But it's all based on diving into a pool.  Are we trying to stay young, right?  Are we finally getting old?  Because I'm looking at this Splash like, what the fuck is going on now?  You're not alone.  Really?  Everybody is looking at that show like it's insanity. 
[00:01:30]  But why would these celebrities, you need fame that badly that you agree to look like a complete idiot?  Yeah.  And some of those people, who cares if they look like complete idiots because they're barely celebrities.  But Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is one of the greatest athletes of all time.  Yeah.  And was showing nothing but respect over the years.  And then you fast forward, he's 65 years old with fucking boobies.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:02:00]  And he's just flopping into a fucking pool.  They put him in some form-fitting outfit.  They even make him look stupid before they make their dumb dive.  It really does matter.  Watch this.  I'm Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, NBA's all-time leading scorer.  I retired in June of 1989.  My basketball career was such a big part of my life.  89.  Succeeded at every level.  Oh.  You're a natural. 
[00:02:30]  That's so great.  Kareem, I wouldn't be surprised if you still play basketball.  Kareem, I'm doing the three meter tomorrow.  Yeah.  Kareem.  I'm doing the three meter.  I'm doing that joke without me getting mad.  I'll make that.  It's fun to watch an athlete who's great at one thing.  Greg Luke's anus.  Oh.  Holy shit.  It's like your grandpa jumping.  It's like watching grandpa jump into a pool.  But why would he think this is good for him?  He just wants to be back in the spotlight? 
[00:03:00]  Maybe.  I don't know.  All I know is watching him face plant into a pool.  Right.  It was, yeah, it was sad.  And we had him in here.  And, you know, the famous story after the interview, he was getting yelled at by his publicist, a mere 20 feet outside our studio.  I mean, getting yelled at because he didn't mention the book enough.  God forbid we talk about, you know, talk about him being the greatest athlete of our time or one of them, certainly. 
[00:03:30]  And now he's on a diving show looking like a complete fool.  Oh.  A complete fool.  Fast forward.  Imagine Michael Jordan.  Because maybe people forget about Kareem Abdul-Jabbar at this point.  Fast forward another 10, 15 years and Michael Jordan is looking like a complete idiot diving into a pool.  Yeah.  You would never, if you went back 10 years, you would say, yeah, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar would never do this.  With his boobies.  With his boobies, right. 
[00:04:00]  Kareem's got boobies.  And then they are interviewing him like they're actually really, you know, training and working towards something.  No, this whole show.  This show's terrible.  Is on TV so we could all laugh at how ridiculous these people look.  That's it.  Yeah.  That's it.  And here's his big dive.  We're watching it here.  Greg Louganis is just applauding.  Kareem is on the diving board.  Right.  Gets right out to the edge. 
[00:04:30]  I guess he's going to try to do.  He's going to try to rotate, right?  A full rotation.  He's in Laker colors.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, he's backwards.  So he's going to do kind of a back flippy thing, I guess.  I don't know.  He just leans over and touches the water.  He's a little fucking galoot.  And then Louganis is looking on very seriously.  Take your time.  Oh, no. 
[00:05:00]  And then he face plants.  Of course he does.  Oh, no.  Why is he doing this?  Why?  He fucked Bruce Lee.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  Kareem.  Oh, my goodness.  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, come on.  Oh.  Are people watching Splash?  A lot of people.  Joey Lawrence's fucking spray on hair, too. 
[00:05:30]  Wow.  What happened to Joey Lawrence?  I don't know.  And then they got actual fucking judges?  Well, they have ex-divers, yes.  People that have been in Olympic diving.  Well, how do you judge that dive?  It was horrendous.  Apparently very well.  You judge it a 7.1 or something like that.  7.1 to have the entire front of your body hit the water at the same time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was just an abomination. 
[00:06:00]  Louie Anderson, also, just, they call it a diving show, and he's supposed to be diving,  and he's judging on diving.  He literally fell off of a diving platform.  It wasn't even a dive.  It was him standing on the edge, and then he just slowly fell off of it.  Yeah, fell forward.  Made a huge splash.  I did not watch Splash.  Oh, I did.  I checked out a couple highlights.  Oh, I had to watch the whole thing.  The Kareem Abdul-Jabbar thing just really, really bothers me. 
[00:06:30]  It was terrible.  Being an old-school NBA fan, you know, you fast-forward on these guys, this is what they're  doing for what reason, I don't know.  This is it.  And, of course, Louie Anderson starts crying.  Oh, did he?  During it.  Yeah.  Why is he crying?  You know, I just thought I couldn't do it, and everybody was supportive.  No.  That really went down?  Yes.  Yes, he's crying.  But he can't do it.  Let's stop making believe he can do it.  Like you said, he fell forward off of a three-meter platform, it looked like, and he was able 
[00:07:00]  to pretty much get his hands to hit the water first.  And he's like, I'm wearing this for the troops.  He was just weepy.  He was so weepy.  You don't like Louie?  Oh, God, no.  He's just enough with him.  I like Louie.  And he's fucking.  You like Louie?  I do.  I've never liked Louie Anderson.  He's so needy.  It's the neediness.  He's so needy.  He's just a nice man who cares, beat up as a boy. 
[00:07:30]  Where's the clip of him crying?  Do we have it?  We get the whole episode.  Huh?  Yeah, show it.  No, but can you find the clip of him crying that Ant's talking about?  You got to show the whole thing of him and his training.  Really?  Because he starts training.  Come on.  They had to help him out of the pool.  Yeah.  Like he goes up to the edge and they were rolling him out of the pool.  It was like just, you know, cash in your dignity.  That's it.  Joey Lawrence's hair.  And that's what happens.  Comes up in a search engine, by the way.  If you put in Joey Lawrence, Joey Lawrence's hair. 
[00:08:00]  All right, pause.  Is he all right?  That's what everybody's saying.  Is he all right?  What happened to him?  He went away that long?  What happened to him?  Whoa.  He was really famous.  What he used to do.  What he's been doing for years.  Yeah.  I think he's, I think it's tattooed.  I don't think it's fake, but it's obviously, he had fake stubble.  Because he went, he lost his hair, obviously.  And they do this procedure now where you can tattoo a stubble on your head.  I know somebody who had it done. 
[00:08:30]  What?  Wait, how do you tattoo stubble?  Is this dots?  Yeah, the same, but it looks, it looks somewhat real.  Wait, who do you know that had this done?  Somebody in my family knows.  Are you kidding?  And you're saying it looks kind of good?  It looks, it looks very cosmetic, but it doesn't look like dots.  Does it look like the look you have when you don't shave for a day?  Yeah.  Like the five o'clock shadow.  Oh, you get stubble.  Oh, so you tattoo.  There's no real height to it.  It's just, you see the darkness of it.  It looks like it.  Oh my God.  It's like tattooing.  Get me a picture of this on the internet. 
[00:09:00]  Someone out, you got to find that.  Now we're all over the place, but we'll bring this back together.  I got to see tattoo stubble.  But that's what Joey Lawrence used to have.  Joey Lawrence also had.  That's tattoo stubble?  Is that it?  That looks, the bottom one doesn't look too even.  But that looks amazing.  Right.  I'm not even going to fucking make fun of it.  No, that absolutely looks amazing.  That, it looks like stubble.  Is there a close up of that? 
[00:09:30]  Come on, what the fuck?  No, that's, that's, that's his actual hair, right?  Yeah, no, that's the tattoo needle right there.  Dude.  No.  Is he just, I mean, you know, because everybody's got at least some kind of stubble on their head,  so they fill it in.  So like, that's what it looked like before the tattoo.  And then they fill it in and make it dark and stuff.  So it looks like you have a full head of hair.  That's crazy.  A full head of stubble hair.  Right.  But you can never grow your hair out.  Well, you could grow it out, but yeah. 
[00:10:00]  Have you seen this in person?  Yeah.  And it looks pretty real?  Yeah, if I didn't know that he had, well, if I didn't know that he was wearing waves for years.  But if you touch it, it's smooth.  Right.  Oh, that would be weird for the ladies.  They might not think though, like if, again, they may think it's a one day.  That is so fucked up.  The fuck is that weird?  I've never heard of this procedure.  But like, the ways you can tell is, number one, if you see them, you know, over the course of days or weeks or whatever,  their hair length never changes.  Right.  And like, look at this guy. 
[00:10:30]  The hairline is just perfect.  It's a perfect line, yes.  Yeah, they've got to figure out that part of all the hair procedures.  But is that what Joey Lawrence has, or did he have follicles?  No, no.  Wait, give me Joey Lawrence over the years.  Because, man, I mean.  Oh, he had quite the mane of hair back then.  And the daytime talk shows used to have him on all the time, and they would just melt when he came on stage.  See, go to the top picture.  That's what he's looked like for years.  That's tattooed on.  That's not real.  No, come on. 
[00:11:00]  Go back and go to the top picture.  Yeah, no, over.  Over one.  There.  See, that looks like, what, like, that's his head?  Is that Joey Lawrence's head?  I don't know.  They're trying to say that that's his head.  That's what it would look like on close-up TV.  But this right here, that's tattooed on.  That's tattooed on.  This is tattooed.  You can see a different color from the front area to the back.  Look, see?  That's weird.  Yeah.  And you can see where it's perfect and faded and everything.  It's tattooed on.  That's wild. 
[00:11:30]  Joey Lawrence's tattoo hair.  That's why last night it looked like his hair was stuck on with tape.  Who is Joey Lawrence?  He said it was stuck on with tape.  Who is he?  He's on Blossom.  Joey Lawrence was fucking huge.  For a while there, man.  I swear to God.  Look at his head of hair there.  This kid.  He's a 90s kid.  Oh, my God.  Jim, he was also on Give Me a Break in the 80s with Nell Carter.  Who did he play?  I remember that.  He was the little, little kid.  Was that Dolph Sweet?  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  And then he did music and all sorts of other shit.  Oh, my God.  So, all right. 
[00:12:00]  Go back to last night because he looks sick.  He looks a little thin.  Because I guess for the Splash show, they needed him to have hair.  AIDS!  No, you just...  I don't even know what...  What?  He just...  He doesn't look right.  And he's not that old.  Let's see.  Oh, my God.  His hair is atrocious.  There's something just so odd going on.  In my opinion, I believe his stubble was tattooed on for years.  And then, you know, he wants a more modern look. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  So, I think that that is an absolute rug.  You think he's just wearing a wig?  He just slapped it on with tape.  No, what that is, is he's going to the David Caruso Halloween costume competition.  Wow, does he have horrendous hairdo.  So, you're saying wig?  I believe so.  Oh, it has to be.  It looks like one.  Yeah, that hair looks ridiculous.  The fucking shadow of the hair.  Yeah, no kidding.  I know, right?  Yeah, that hairline is not very natural.  All right, go back to Louie Anderson now, crying.  I'm obsessed with this splash show. 
[00:13:00]  Weeping Louie.  This is what it's come down to, huh?  Dude, I couldn't turn away.  They're not even trying anymore in Hollywood.  No.  It's like, ah, let's get people, I don't know, to try diving.  Yep.  And there'll always be celebrities that'll sign out for this shit.  Yeah.  Always.  In a final dive-off.  All right, it's time to find out who is number two in the pool.  Say hello to comedian Louie Anderson.  Oh, yeah.  Huge yellow bathrobe. 
[00:13:30]  Look at him.  Oh, hi, Louie.  He looks like a big peep.  A yellow robe.  Oh.  This is a freak show.  Absolutely.  Yeah, of course it is, because we all love freak shows, but you can't just say that.  Anymore.  Look at the freak jump in the pool.  Right.  Of course.  Look at the fat boy jump in the pool.  All right, here we go.  Watch the splash he makes.  Very sense. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, boy.  Most people know me as the stand-up comic or the cartoon character Little Louie in Life  with Louie.  Really?  How long ago was that?  I don't know.  400 pounds going in the water?  It's a lot easier than getting 400 pounds out of the water.  Oh, my God.  He can't even get out of a pool by himself.  Is he that big?  400 pounds.  Oh, my God.  He can't even get out of it.  Why not use the step ladder?  I played professional football in the NFL, and it was still taxing for me to pull Louie 
[00:14:30]  out of the pool.  Someone should get in the water.  I've had problems getting people in the pool.  Getting him out of the pool was scary.  Really?  He's got a long road ahead of us.  Look at the...  He has a long road ahead of him?  Oh, my God.  He's got a very short road ahead of him.  I'm going to be able to get out of the pool on my own.  Thank you.  You keep up the good work.  You've got to get out of here healthy.  All right.  Thank you so much.  Oh, no.  Pause this.  Oh, no.  You like that?  No, I don't.  Of course not.  You didn't like that?  That's how we start the show.  Why is Kareem doing all this? 
[00:15:00]  His shirt says Skyhook.  He's got a Skyhook T-shirt.  What is he, hoping to sell some of those?  He's got no money.  He can't.  No, Kareem's broke.  No, he's not.  He's got to be broke.  Dude, he retired in 89.  Why would he do this?  He retired in 89.  That's 24 years ago.  In 89, he wasn't making the type of money they're making today.  Why would he do something like this?  Now go back to Kareem.  How much was he making in his final couple of years?  Oh, no.  He's probably...  You're probably right.  He has no fucking money.  So he's selling Skyhook T-shirts, and he's on this dumb splash show. 
[00:15:30]  I bet he was $2 million a year back then.  Some of the NBA guys should just fucking write him a check and throw it in the  mailbox for him saying, hey, this is for you because you fucking paved the way for us  and the big fucking salaries that we're getting now.  The NBA, they just don't take care of their own.  They don't really do that.  So they have a program where they have some kind of money that filters down to some of  these guys that came before him?  His highest year was $3 million, and that was the most money he made in a year. 
[00:16:00]  How many years did he make that?  I wouldn't think long.  Probably not many, and probably near the end of his career, I would assume.  The minute that he took off his robe and you could see his titties in his bathing suit,  you knew that he couldn't...  He can't have money because he looked at himself in the mirror.  He knows what he looks like.  Why would he...  He wouldn't do that.  If you have money, you don't have to do that.  You're fucking Kareem.  You know.  You're an airplane, for the love of God. 
[00:16:30]  Because it just doesn't matter.  What is his net worth?  That says $20 million, but there's...  I don't know, man.  He might have some...  I don't know why I think he has money.  I feel like he should have money.  Something's not right if he's wearing a Skyhook t-shirt.  It's probably his publicist.  Put that on, you'll sell some shirts.  He doesn't go on unless he can wear the Skyhook shirt.  That's true.  You know, that's fucking wrecking balls.  She was brutal.  Why wouldn't they have Louie jump in the side of the pool where the fucking stepladder was?  Because they want...  Because it's a freak show.  They have to roll him out of the pool. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, but why is he...  There's a stepladder.  Like a killer whale.  They don't...  They want you to see Louie Anderson struggling to get out of a pool.  And they probably said to him, it will help show your struggle.  Of course.  So play this one up.  We just figured out another way to show freak shows on TV.  Yeah.  That's all.  That's all this is.  Put him in the pool.  All right.  Let's...  Yeah, back to Louie.  Travis, you got something to add?  Oh, Louie.  Louie Anderson.  Yeah. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, he apparently made a lot of bad financial decisions.  Oh.  Louie?  No.  Kareem.  Yeah.  His house burned down, so that cost him a lot of money.  Three million, I think, if I remember right.  And...  He went into...  Didn't he try to get Kareem of Wheat?  No?  Apparently, his agent put his money in all the wrong places.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I remember his house.  He had a world-renowned jazz collection.  He's a jazz freak.  Right.  And the records were being donated to him because he had very rare albums, and they all burned 
[00:18:00]  when his house burned.  That was, like, early 90s, I think.  Yes.  Oh.  That's sad.  He was sad when he came in here, and so was Dr. J.  bothered me, too.  Remember, his shirt was a little off and a little wrinkly and, like, a little old.  And you know that was, like, he broke out one of his better shirts for his trip to New  York.  I'm like, you're Dr. J.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah.  His agent, whatever deal he signed with his agent, basically gave his agent the right  to do whatever he wanted with his money.  He gave him fucking power of attorney. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, that's the dumbest thing.  He could sign checks for him.  He could do whatever he wanted.  Oh, Kareem.  For all our listeners out there, pick a good agent, please.  And don't give him power of attorney.  Yeah, don't ever do that.  Yeah, you sign your own checks.  I sign my own checks.  I sign every fucking check.  You have to.  He wasn't receiving monthly statements, so he didn't know what was going on.  Yeah, the guy ripped him off.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The guy obviously ripped him off.  It's a Billy Joel situation.  And now he's fucking...  Billy Joel got ripped off badly by a family member.  Now he's what?  65.  Brother-in-law.  65?  65. 
[00:19:00]  Trying to make some kind of weird comeback on a strange fucking TV show.  Jumping face first into a pool.  And he looked pathetic.  Oh, yeah.  It was pathetic.  My wife was watching, like, why would they do this to this poor old man?  The poor old guy.  And he was not a likable enough guy.  Like, Kareem was a really weird guy, so he probably should have been an NBA that should  have taken care of him.  Like, you know, Bird is coaching.  He's just not likable enough, and I don't think he can get along with enough people.  He tried to coach, I think, for a little while.  He did, right?  Yeah, I believe so.  And that's fire?  Did she feel bad for him?  Oh, my gosh.  He doesn't have much of a personality, Kareem.  He never really did. 
[00:19:30]  She was watching him stand on the diving board, worried that he was going to die when he hit  the water.  She completely...  I thought it was going to break something.  You got to tell her, he's not going to die.  They already filmed this.  I told her...  That would have been a big news story.  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar dies hitting pool water.  I told her about the publicist that yelled at him, and she was like, why would anybody  yell at that sweet old man?  He looked at us, too, during the yelling.  Like, almost...  Almost like, help me.  Could we rescue him?  What could we do?  Can you imagine being Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1989? 
[00:20:00]  Right.  And then having to be Kareem Abdul-Jabbar now?  He was untouchable.  He was a massive fucking star.  Do you remember?  I remember the last time he walked off the court, it was against the Pistons.  They were getting swept 4-0, and it was fucking...  It was emotional.  The Pistons gave him a standing ovation.  It was in Detroit, I think.  It was fucking...  Very good, yeah.  ...4-0 whipping.  That was it.  Were you a mad dog?  No, but I remember...  I was a Lakers...  No, that's a big highlight.  I played the Kareem, and I liked...  That's the only reason I liked the Lakers.  The Lakers-Celtics series over the years?  Wow.  Fuck.  They beat Detroit...  The year before, in Game 7, Abdul-Jabbar had to sink two fucking free throws in, like, 
[00:20:30]  with 30 seconds left or whatever, and it was like, this motherfucker can handle pressure.  I'll never forget that.  He sunk two free throws.  Now we have to see the clip of him walking off the field.  Off the court, yeah.  Off the court, I mean, excuse me.  I guess...  I didn't believe it long ago.  Yeah.  So that's 24 years ago.  So what about the fire?  What is it?  He lost everything.  In the fire, he had, like, a bunch of rugs that were uninsured that were worth hundreds  of thousands of dollars.  Oh, he loves his rugs.  Oh, it's a maze.  The one on Joey Lawrence's head? 
[00:21:00]  You have that one?  His house was insured, but he overspent by two million rebuilding it.  Oh.  Wow.  But his agent just...  Why can't we have better culture, maybe?  Oh, this is in New York.  I'm sorry.  And the camera went down, and Mahorn's ginger lead.  This is 89?  I mean, in L.A.  Jesus.  TV sucked in 89.  Doreen Abdul-Jabbar.  47 seconds left in this game, and his team's traveling. 
[00:21:30]  Mahorn has fouled out of the game, and LeBier will replace him.  And there's a hit.  That's it, huh?  Yep.  That was it.  How long did he play?  20 years.  Yeah, he made about 20 years.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was about 40, 41 when he retired. 
[00:22:00]  That's it.  Now he just sits there, and that's his career.  And...  I remember the...  I remember the...  No, I remember the...  I remember the fucking Pistons gave me a standing ovation.  I think there was probably more to it.  Yeah.  There was more to it.  It's just a horrible club.  All right, back to Louie Anderson.  Oh, boy.  It's all about him.  20 years.  Louie Anderson struggling to get out of a fucking pool. 
[00:22:30]  But that's what happens when you're not pleasant.  Like, Jordan would have to really fuck up to have that happen.  And so would guys like Larry Bird.  Guys that people like, because they want them to work.  They don't want those legends to look bad.  It looks bad for the NBA.  He had a divorce, too.  Oh, no!  Everything that could go wrong with the guy.  All the features.  13 million he basically just lost.  Between the fire, the divorce, and his...  So he really doesn't have much money.  I doubt he has...  There's no way.  ...much of anything. 
[00:23:00]  I mean, he's swimming.  Not only does he have to swim with a shirt on, like Louie Anderson, but you can still see  his breasts through his shirt.  And they are ample.  Yeah, you don't subject yourself to that when you're Kareem Abdul-Jabbar if you don't need  the money.  Right.  Oh, Kareem.  I just want to pay him to go to dinner with me.  No kidding.  I'll give you 500 to go to dinner with me.  He probably would.  We saw it, man.  He was in here.  We saw it.  And he had to listen to the publicist, because obviously there's some kind of desperation  there.  Right.  Because the old Kareem would have said... 
[00:23:30]  He would have fucking taken his foot right to her forehead and walked out of here.  The only thing that humbles you that quickly, because he had to have the biggest ego in  the world when he left the NBA, the only thing that would strip you of your ego is  if you lose everything.  Right.  Oh, it's terrible.  It's horrible.  I love Kareem.  Fuck.  All right, look.  And then you got Louie Anderson.  Louie.  You can't even get out of a fucking pool when ABC films it, because they, you know, good  for them.  Yeah.  But stop making believe...  Would you film it, too?  Of course.  Stop making believe your family entertainment, though. 
[00:24:00]  You know what you're doing.  You think it would be great TV to see a real fucking fat guy struggling to get out of a  pool.  Yeah.  If I hope he filmed it, at least it would say, fatty can't get out of a pool.  Of course.  It would say, pig stuck.  Right.  The elevator show.  Right.  Fat Louie.  Of course I would.  Right.  But they'll sugarcoat it and make believe that's not what they're doing.  It's an inspirational story.  No, it's not.  He's a fat fuck that's going to die soon because he's not taking care of himself, and he almost  drowned trying to get out of a pool.  There's the story. 
[00:24:30]  Let's listen to him.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Uh-oh.  I don't know if this is true.  To add insult to injury, Kareem has leukemia.  What?  I got to go to this phone call.  I haven't heard that.  Well, this guy has to prove it somehow.  Will.  Yes.  How do you know he has leukemia?  Because I have the same type of leukemia.  But I haven't seen any headlines that Kareem has leukemia. 
[00:25:00]  She fought so hard, Margie.  I don't know.  She had leukemia.  I fucking love you, Rico.  Huh?  He has what's called CML, chronic myelogenous leukemia.  Yep.  There you go.  There's the headline.  He also has leukemia on top of it.  Jesus.  Thank you, Will.  He's jumping in a pool face first.  Face planning.  Because he needs money.  A 65-year-old with leukemia shouldn't be fucking diving into pools.  They said it's no longer considered a death sentence or the kind he has.  Right. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, but it still probably makes him all icky in the morning.  He calls him probably a motherfucker every time that alarm clock goes off.  He has leukemia.  See, it's like Luel Cinder.  This is why I stink at my job.  Because all I'm thinking is how I tie in Louie Anderson with Louie Kamea.  And forgot his name was Luel Cinder.  Luel Cinder.  I missed the most obvious one.  Oh.  Oh, he has Luke Grant Kamea.  Good one, idiots.  All right, let's get back to Louie almost drowning in the pool now. 
[00:26:00]  Louie Anderson.  Thank you so much.  One of the top 50 players of all time.  He's telling me I can do it.  Oh.  Did he say one of the top 50 players of all time?  Pause.  Did he say the top 50 players?  Well, because the NBA did that official top 50 players of all time.  Oh, they did?  Top three.  Top five.  Yeah, Louie Anderson doesn't know basketball, obviously, because most people would put him  He's shaped like one.  Most people would put him in the top five.  Yeah.  The highest score on the game.  Most people's list would put Kareem in the top five. 
[00:26:30]  Absolutely.  He's by far the highest scorer.  The only guy with a shot was Jordan.  And he didn't come close.  I mean, he came as close as he could come.  He got out too soon.  Wow.  I suppose Jabbar has almost an unbreakable record.  Do you think LeBron can break that?  Karl Malone gave it a pretty good shot, too.  Yeah, I think Malone did okay.  But these are fucking 20 events.  Karl Malone did pretty well.  Yeah, well, they sit him now, too.  They sit a lot of these guys, so they don't run up their personal scores as much as they  used to. 
[00:27:00]  You know, those blowout games when you could get another 10, 15, 20 points in, they always  sit the guys.  And that adds up after a while.  That Louie didn't know.  Why do I care that Louie didn't know Kareem's ranking?  Because he doesn't know a solid bar, either.  I'm a fool.  One of the top 50 baseball players.  Louie Anderson bothers me.  Louie is uncomfortable.  It's a goof show, and he's sitting there crying, going, Kareem told me I could do it.  Do what?  What is he doing?  Yeah, it's just bad.  I like Louie. 
[00:27:30]  He was nice.  I did his show, but I first, in the late 90s, and he was a very sweet man.  I'm sure he's a nice, very sweet.  Very sweet.  Just a big, big lug.  Yeah.  I mean, a big lug.  I don't like the people that come across needy, though.  He's so needy.  I don't like those types of people.  You see him almost cry.  He came really close to crying there.  Just talking about, he said that I can do it.  He's telling me I can do it.  I can do it.  Did you get choked up when he said that?  No!  Oh, yeah.  I'm getting mad. 
[00:28:00]  I'm getting mad.  Exactly.  All right, let's go back to...  I got choked up.  It's a goof show.  If it was the biggest loser or something, where you know they're going to go through some major  fucking training, and you know they're going to have to lose a lot of weight and struggle  and sacrifice, sure, then maybe I get a little emotional.  I'm not this goof show called Splash.  His goal is to roll himself out of a pool.  Right.  Exactly.  Set that bar low.  I got teary-eyed with The Biggest Loser over the years. 
[00:28:30]  I don't watch anymore, but that would fucking choke you up, some of those stories.  I'll tell you, when I got teary-eyed with The Biggest Loser, when I had been emailing  with someone and realized they belonged on that show, it was a fucking close-up of your  face.  Yeesh.  A little voodoo, huh?  That's great.  All right.  Louie Anderson.  I've had problems getting people in the pool.  Getting him out of the pool was scary.  It was scary. 
[00:29:00]  Louie's got a long road ahead.  Look at it.  Come on, Louie.  My goal is that I'm going to be able to get out of the pool on my own.  You keep up with good work.  That's his goal.  You got to get out of here healthy.  Good.  Thank you so much.  Good for you.  One of the top 50 players of all time.  He's telling me I can do it.  Oh, Louie.  Tonight, my goal is to shock everyone at how far I've progressed.  It's like a miracle that I was given this opportunity.  It's like, you know, like someone was looking out for me. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, no one's looking out for you.  Shut up.  What opportunity?  Shut up.  Pause.  What is going on?  It's insanity.  What opportunity is happening here?  There's no opportunity there.  They want to pay you to jump into a pool because if you're hanging out by a pool and there's  a big fat person, everyone's waiting for the fat person to jump in the pool.  Of course.  That's exactly what this is.  Somebody saw the clip of Ralphie May on Celebrity Fit Club. 
[00:30:00]  It's like, we need that.  Right.  Let's get that.  Be careful talking about Ralphie May.  He takes it very seriously.  Well, he knows, doesn't he?  He takes it very seriously if we even mention his name.  No.  I mean, I'm sure there was plenty of celebrities in pretty good shape that would have done this  show seriously.  They didn't want that.  They wanted the 400-pound slob and the ancient giant.  The ancient giant.  Right.  They hired the midget from Chelsea Handler's show.  Oh, they did?  Chewy on there?  Yeah.  They got the midget and then they got the hot fucking girlfriend of the quarterback. 
[00:30:30]  The Alabama?  What?  No, no, no.  Remember the Alabama?  The Alabama quarterback.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  She's on this?  Fucking.  They put her in this swimsuit.  It wasn't very flattering.  She looked great, but it could have been so much better with a hotter swimsuit.  Right.  But she fucking had such camel toe.  Really?  I was just watching.  Jimmy, big fat pussy on her.  No, can we see a photo, Sam?  I want to see her. 
[00:31:00]  Big fat pussy.  She's tall.  Her legs and ass looked great up on the board.  She looked pretty goddamn good.  How tall do you think she is?  She's like...  18 feet.  Oh, see, I would have thought taller.  Do you know, I've been getting a thing where I kind of like...  Like, I met a couple girls, like, recently who were, like, 5'10", 5...  And there's something...  You're like those tall girls, man.  The Adam's Apples.  No, no, no.  Not the pecker havers.  Pecker havers.  But a tall, like, fucking...  Like, an athletic...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, not a basketball 6'3 girl, but a tall athlete girl with the juicy fucking legs to wrap around you. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, you want that?  Big pussy, man.  I want to be with a giant.  I always had to be with shorter women.  Well, you're 5'11", though.  Huh?  You're 5'11", right?  5'10"?  Six foot with shoes.  Are you trying to squeeze an inch on me somewhere?  Six foot with shoes on.  That's what I tell people.  Well, yeah, it's hard to find girls who are 6'3".  I was never this height, though.  You know what?  I just never wanted...  Ah, whatever.  Well, do you know why I need women who are taller than me?  Why?  Because I'm a little sprout. 
[00:32:00]  Aw.  Wow.  Why would they put her in a shitty bathing suit?  Let me see, Sammy.  Show me the puss.  I can't see it, Sam.  It's not really highlighting it very well, but...  Sam, show her vagina.  Stop hiding it.  Why don't you want to see her cunt, Sam?  That smile looks terrible.  She's retarded.  It's not a good picture of her at all.  Let me see the smile.  Well, she's squinting because it's sunny out.  Oh.  I can see a little depth to the pussy right there.  I can't.  Around the thigh area, you can see it sticking out a little.  Oh, that's just the sundial.  That's called the sundial twat effect.  Oh, look. 
[00:32:30]  They're showing Kareem face-planting again.  It's everywhere today.  It's all over the place.  It's everywhere.  They're all like, ooh, that's not good.  Oh.  Yeah.  God damn it.  That looks like a fucking puffy one.  Yeah.  I hope it's just that she's on her period and she has a pad.  And she doesn't want to look like fucking Frank Nitty.  That's right.  Frank Nitty.  What do you think Kareem Abdul-Jabbar thought?  When, like, somebody who used to be on the star level of him shows up to this show and  he realizes that the other celebrities include the midget from Chelsea Handler and the girl 
[00:33:00]  who used to date Hugh Hefner.  And the Cosby kid.  Yeah.  And he's like, what?  And a girl they just showed at a fucking game once.  Yeah, they fucking put a camera on her at a game and she's the other celeb.  And now she's a huge celebrity.  Well, I was in the audience.  That's just like being the all-time, you know, scorer in the NBA.  Is she still dating that guy?  I don't know.  I think they've had problems ever since that shit.  Because it's like that guy who is hating.  I'd date her.  Oh, yeah, right? 
[00:33:30]  Hello.  Really?  You would?  What a surprise there.  Take her out for a multi.  Very statuesque up on the diving platform.  All right, back to Louie who couldn't.  Louie.  I can't believe he's getting this opportunity and this chance to look like a fucking fool.  To look like a fucking buffoon.  It's like a miracle, he said.  Oh, he did say it's a miracle.  Huh?  Go ahead.  You made it.  You made it, Louie.  Thank you.  Hi, Chris. 
[00:34:00]  I mean, six.  You know, there are no elevators on these.  There are no elevators.  That's what I'm told.  Oh, my God.  So two people carried me up.  Well, Louie, six weeks ago, you literally couldn't.  Get out of the pool.  It's true.  We saw the emotional interview.  Here you are now standing on the five-meter platform.  It is 16 feet in the air.  How did you get this far?  Wait until you see the surprise twist.  I think what I did was I had to, like, find my inner diver.  Mm-hmm.  And he was buried very deep, obviously.  Yeah.  Not a fat joke.  We got it.  You're fat, Louie.  I was a kid.  I could never get up the rope in gym class. 
[00:34:30]  So this is my rope.  Before the first time, it's already been a success.  God, you could never get up the rope.  I bet a lot of rope got up him, though.  Funny when he said that.  They took the place strange fruit for the troops.  For the troops.  For all the service people all over the world.  All the kids from down there.  And diving for you.  All right.  All right, Louie.  Nice man.  Louie's got a fez smile.  You got it.  He does.  They've got similar smiles.  Here he goes.  He's out on the platform. 
[00:35:00]  Working his way to the edge.  Overlooking the pool.  Louie Anderson at the 16-foot mark.  You got it, Louie.  Oh, what?  That's Greg.  Greg?  Greg.  Greg Liggins?  I got to go up one more level.  Whoa!  That's the twist?  Yeah.  Yeah, see, he goes to the next platform, higher.  In front of the whole thing just collapsed.  Pancakes.  He has not done this. 
[00:35:30]  And Greg Liggins goes, he has not done this.  Oh, shut up.  Not true.  They would have him, like, practicing quite a few times from the 23-foot level.  That would scare me.  Of course it would.  I would do a cannonball.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, Jesus, Louie.  Oh.  And he just fought like he was shot.  You just look at this.  Oh, they go to commercials.  Oh, they go to commercials.  This falls.  Oh, my God.  And I believe I did say yesterday that they would cut to a spot right before that. 
[00:36:00]  Because that's what you do on these shows.  You got to cut to a commercial.  I think I finally had it with these reality shows.  Haven't you?  They're all the same shit.  All right.  Here he goes.  All right.  Here it is.  Louie Anderson.  Louie Anderson.  Yeah, I'm big and fat.  All right.  He falls.  Here he goes.  Here he goes.  All right.  Where's the dive?  And then he's just over.  His legs fly over his fat head. 
[00:36:30]  He's a big fella.  He hits the pool.  And then he gets a standing ovation for falling in a pool.  And now is he dramatically going to get out of the pool by himself?  Probably not, right?  They did use the same thing that took David Caruso out in Officer and a Gentleman.  They don't show him getting out of the pool because guess what?  He still can't get out of the pool by himself.  Or they finally put a ladder in him.  Then you're going to go, oh, I wasn't that there before.  Look at Joey Lawrence as far as Gump hairdo. 
[00:37:00]  How is that terrible?  Well, I remember the old Tarzan movies where you'd jump off the cliff like the old swan dive.  And that's exactly what you did.  You looked like Tarzan as you took off.  Tarzan?  Stop it.  Oh, he's looking.  You can see as you got a little closer to the water, it resembled Georgia the Jungle.  But that's okay.  Do you like that tip?  Fucking home run.  I never did the seven front dives, so I wanted to give it a try. 
[00:37:30]  So you saved it just for us, just for tonight.  For Splash.  That is special.  For Splash.  Well, I'm inspired.  I've given you a seven.  A seven?  Seven.  I'm a fucking one.  Terrible.  Because they want him back next week so we can laugh at him some more.  You're breaking your goals left and right.  I mean, you can't even get out of the pool the first day.  You're going up to the five meters, 16 feet, and you're like, I'm going to go to 23 feet, seven meters, and now I'm going to do a swan dive. 
[00:38:00]  Like, that's insane.  I mean, you're thinking a swan dive.  That's a good judge.  That's way better than a score that I'll ever get.  Right.  That was not a swan dive.  I'm going to score you a seven and a half, though.  Seven and a half.  Seven and a half.  Seven and a half.  Survey says fat slack.  They can only get two judges for this show, huh?  Yeah.  They got two fucking judges.  Everyone else is like, get the fuck out of here.  I'm not judging a free show.  He's got Forrest Gump.  He does.  Oh, my God. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, it's terrible.  Do they vote someone off?  Yeah, Rudy got thrown off.  Little Rudy.  You beat me to what I was going to say.  Oh, sorry.  What happened?  I knew they wouldn't throw off any of the slobs.  I knew they wouldn't throw off a midget, a fat guy, or a giant.  So I was going to say if they vote someone off, it would be just a regular type of person.  It was between, what's her name, Webb there?  Catherine, is her name?  Catherine Webb.  Catherine Webb.  The hot chick.  The hot chick.  Because no one knows her.  Because they also want, you know, celebrities that people know.  Because the judges have a say in it, but the audience also votes, Opie. 
[00:39:00]  So they had Catherine Webb and little Rudy from the Cosby show.  Rudy, Rudy, Rudy.  And it was between them two, and Rudy didn't make the cut.  Yeah.  So we will not be seeing the old Cosby kids being dropped off at the pool.  How does Rudy look like these days?  What did you say yesterday?  Nice tits.  She looks all right?  But she's got a fat ass on her.  But her tits look pretty fucking, like, wrapped up in that swimsuit. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, she's Rudy, you know.  Let's take a look at Rudy really fast.  Why wouldn't you take the picture all the way to the right?  Yeah, that's the one.  To see the tit shot.  That's the one.  Is that from Splash?  Yeah, she's looking pretty good there, right?  Uh, yeah, she's all right.  She's a little thick.  She is thick.  She's thick.  A little thick.  But, um...  Nice eyes, though.  Yeah, Rudy got rid of her little Rudy mustache.  She had a mustache. 
[00:40:00]  Remember back in the Cosby days?  She was a little kid with a fucking mustache.  Aw.  Yeah, she had a mustache.  So she, uh, gone.  Gone.  And then there were some people that didn't even dive yesterday.  Why?  I don't know.  They fucking, uh...  Because they're trying to stretch this shit out.  Yes!  Catch him next week.  What?  Catch him next week.  Yeah, that's what it is.  Because they knew you wouldn't just tune in again to watch that fat fuck or the fossil  jump off a diving board.  Well, now that Louis, like, fell into the pool, what else is there to see from him? 
[00:40:30]  Maybe see him improve.  How?  If they did these great dives at the beginning of the season here, you'd be like, oh, now  you're going to be like, I bet they show his first dive at the end and go like,  look at what...  And now look at him.  And he's doing these amazing fucking...  Could you see he does this Olympic style fucking five flips?  Yeah, okay.  Hits the water with nary a splash.  Here's why Ant's right.  Because that fucking...  That Miss Alabama has her hand over her puss. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, yeah.  She knows it's probably a fucking mammoth, fucking bulbous monstrosity.  That juice wound she's got there.  And what, ABC probably sent out a memo that they can't be in bikinis, right?  Yeah, probably.  Look at that.  Her body is good, but she's not...  Nah, she's fucking perfect.  Nah, she looks really...  Nah, her body isn't perfect, Jimmy.  No, she's...  Sorry.  It's good.  She has some...  She's big.  She's...  Her weight is distributed in various parts of her body. 
[00:41:30]  Like...  But I think she's fucking smoking.  Her knees are shitty.  You don't like her knees?  They're shitty.  She has Kareem knees.  Oh, God.  You know who's got a nice body?  Like fucking Hogan's daughter.  Like that type of body.  The big thighs.  Really?  You can just reach under and hold her ass.  It's a little too much.  Oh, no.  A little too masculine.  There's some masculinity there.  No, it's all smooth and womanly.  You get tricked because her face is beautiful, but there's some masculinity happening with her body.  Matronly?  Yeah, look.  She's hiding that juicy fucking pleasure pocket. 
[00:42:00]  She really is.  Yeah.  She's probably been stopped so many times, I think she's stealing items from the meat store.  Excuse me, do you have a roast in your pants?  How many weeks is this show going to be?  It's a full run.  I mean, they're only eliminating one person.  What do you mean it's a full run?  It's 13 weeks, I guess.  Watch the ratings drop drastically.  Oh, it's going to be nothing.  Nothing.  There's nothing to this show.  And it's the lead-in for Dancing with the Stars.  Yeah.  So I think they had good ratings, and Dancing with the Stars had good ratings last night.  And I think it's because a lot of people were watching this freak show just for a week. 
[00:42:30]  Like, you're going to notice a big drop-off.  By the way, D.L. Hughley, holy shit, he cannot dance at all.  No.  It was really hard to watch.  D.L.?  Yeah.  Is he out?  Can't dance.  Is he out?  I don't know.  They didn't vote anybody off.  I don't watch Dancing with the Stars.  But I don't either.  It was on after this, and I just kind of left it on.  Took a look.  You can tell when dancers can't dance on that show, when the guy just stands there and moves  his arms a little, and the woman is fucking, she's fucking dancing like a maniac around 
[00:43:00]  him.  Yeah, trying to distract the judges.  Yeah.  It's like they're dancing together.  Who did that?  We played a clip last year of someone that just kind of stood there.  Yeah, that didn't even do anything.  Who the fuck was it?  Look at poor D.L.  He's like, he looks so uncomfortable.  This is so uncomfortable.  Come on.  Jimmy, look.  Look, Jimmy, look.  Oh, no.  D.L.  Watch, watch.  He's barely moving, because he doesn't know what to do. 
[00:43:30]  Wow, he hasn't done anything yet.  No.  D.L.  Hughley has no rhythm.  None.  None.  He's terrible.  And I don't know dancing, but I can tell this was bad.  Look at him.  He's...  Wow.  He has nothing.  Nothing.  He's terrible. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, look.  Oh, my God, D.L.  It's time to watch, Jimmy.  Oh, my God.  Look, he's barely moving.  And his feet, he can't, he doesn't know where to put him.  And then he does that move again.  With the arms.  Yeah.  Doing this move again.  And she's dancing her ass off.  Yeah.  And then it kind of...  What kind of marks did he get?  Oh, D.L.  We don't know.  How does this show work? 
[00:44:30]  They vote someone off tonight?  I don't know what a good score is or a bad score.  Do they vote him off?  How does this work?  They vote off people.  Is it tonight?  Yeah, they usually do the...  But didn't he get his scores?  Yeah.  Oh, then it's down to the last two or something?  Right.  Yeah.  And then what happens?  And then they just kick someone off.  Oh.  That explains everything.  Does it?  That explains everything.  Because he's a great comic.  Yes.  That's why.  Because when he was younger, nobody was going to fuck him dancing like that.  So he better be funny. 
[00:45:00]  You best be a funny motherfucker.  Oh, my God.  Distract him by making him laugh.  He'd probably do that arm thing and be funny on the dance floor.  Because everybody else was dancing like a motherfucker around him.  And he's like, I can't get any pussy like this.  He'd make girls laugh and then fuck them.  That's unbelievable.  Very good observation, Jimmy.  That's exactly why he's a great comic.  You're right.  If you ever said, why is D.L. great?  Show this clip and you go, I get it.  So bad.  I can't believe he had nothing.  Nothing.  As far as rhythm goes.  I want to call him and make fun.  Nothing.  You know who looks good?  Let's get him on the phone.  You know who looks good and did a good job dancing is that fucking Kelly Pickler. 
[00:45:30]  I don't like her short fucking hair, but her body and that dress that she was in.  I always loved Kelly Pickler.  She looked fucking good.  Let me take a look at Kelly Pickler.  Put her on there and, like I said, her hair.  Get your blonde flowing locks back.  But they had her in some nice fucking dress.  I always liked her.  She's fucking dancing.  And she looked pretty goddamn good.  I gotta say.  She went and got the implants and stuff.  She looked good.  But, man, she was a natural. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, she was naturally kind of.  But she's getting all those gigs in Hollywood, so she started, you know, getting a lot of  fucking plastic and shit.  Wow, that's Kelly Pickler?  I don't like her at all.  No, the dikey hair sucks.  She's trying to look like Miley Cyrus because that hairdo works well for her.  That's her?  Dude, dude.  Yuck.  But look how her body looks when she's dancing in that dress.  She's got a good little body on her.  What happened to her?  I don't know.  Her American Idol wasn't that long ago, was it?  Yeah, it was.  How long? 
[00:46:30]  Five years ago.  It was.  Oh, wow.  She looks great there, though.  She looks good there, though.  Yeah, look at this.  Dude, look at her.  Yeah, she looks great there.  She cleans up nice.  And she's moving.  Like, she's doing shit.  You think D.L. was watching this going, oh, maybe I should have done something.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's got a great body.  Right?  Look at her legs forever.  A nice ass.  Actually, the short hair works on her, too.  With, like this, right?  Right, yeah.  Yeah.  That's why I was surprised, because I was looking at first going, eh. 
[00:47:00]  And then when they had her come out, it's like, okay.  Right.  She looks good.  All right.  I'm just watching TV now.  I'm watching fucking people dance.  Yeah.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  And then Andy Dick was fucking horrible.  He was doing some Top Hat and Kane thing.  It was so bad.  Another one I hate.  I don't like Andy Dick. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  Andy Dick.  I didn't love him either until we had him in.  When he was in, I was just surprised at what a nice dude he was.  And he was crying, too, on the show.  I didn't think I was going to like him at all.  On what show?  On The Dancer with the Stars.  Why?  He's sitting in a corner, and so he's with his dance partner going, I just don't want  to look stupid.  Well, then he shouldn't have went on Celebrity Rehab and Sober House.  Yeah.  Looked like an idiot.  Oh, that's terrible.  Right?  He did both those shows, or was it just Celebrity Rehab?  He definitely did one of them.  Yeah.  Fucking enough with Andy Dick.  Andy Dick. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, yeah.  They did some kind of, like they had to do a theme thing where he's got a Top Hat and  a cane, and he is another one that just doesn't do anything.  His partner was pretty fucking hot, though.  Chuck Liddell.  Remember when Chuck Liddell danced?  That made me laugh so hard.  It was so bad.  He's trying to smile.  He just looks like a fucking, an angry bull out on the dance floor. 
[00:48:30]  He's putting on the ribs.  Young Frankenstein.  He's putting on the ribs.  He's putting on the ribs.  He's like he's going to kill everybody.  Holy fuck.  That's a scary, scary guy.  Oh, God.  The dancers just lead them around like puppets.  Is this show Jump the Shark yet there, Sam Roberts?  I mean, the casts are just worse and worse every year.  Really?  Yeah.  There's so many people.  You don't know who they are on this show this year.  Like who?  I know all these guys so far.  It's a very young girl that I have no idea who she is. 
[00:49:00]  Andy Dick, D.L. Hughley, Kelly Pickler, and Wynonna Judd.  Those are the big names.  Those are the big names.  Wynonna Judd looked like she ate Louie Anderson.  She's huge.  She fucking, and they had her in some dress, and she's trying to look all sexy dancing.  She's fucking giant.  Just giant.  Don't they usually lose a lot of weight?  You'd think.  Maybe they don't have to work as hard as they used to in past seasons.  Because a lot of these celebrities, they all talk about how much weight they lost.  Right.  Training for Dancing with the Stars. 
[00:49:30]  Now, there's no.  Oh, they have some gospel-y singer.  Look at her.  She is so fucking heinous.  Look at her.  Big fucking.  Look at her.  She looks like Divine.  Yeah, Divine.  Very good.  She's trying to be sassy.  Like, oh.  Look, I'm light on my feet.  Oh, boy.  She looks like she has hemorrhoids. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, I bet there's a world of hurt in that crack.  She just looks like it.  Oh, God.  Oh, God, what a mess.  She's a disastrous fat woman.  Ugh.  There's no.  Stop trying to look sexy.  Sexy.  Sorry, fatties.  It ain't working.  By the way.  Uh, bullet a week.  Got some info on Kelly Pickler.  I did not know this, but she shaved her head for a friend who has cancer.  Uh, cancer.  Oh.  Jesus.  That sounds to me like you're making fun of somebody.  Hey, here's what you look like. 
[00:50:30]  Ah.  Kelly Pickler's got a great body.  Oh, I didn't know that.  She looked, uh, pretty goddamn good.  I'm gonna tell you.  Yep.  All right, why don't we, uh, take a break?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe Anthony can show me how to use my GoPro on a break.  Oh, right.  Your GoPro.  You got a GoPro.  What are you gonna do with the GoPro?  You know what, dude?  I was in a fucking...  I bought a new jacket finally yesterday.  I was in, uh...  North Face.  Mm-hmm.  And they had them displayed.  GoPro's rule.  I wanted to get one, but it's impossible to use. 
[00:51:00]  Why?  Oh.  I don't know how to...  Opie, I don't know how to set it up.  Why?  You just gotta, like, set it.  Opie, I don't know what to do.  Is the button on the front, the button on the top.  I don't know what to do, Anthony.  And you gotta, like, use one as the menu button and the other one for select.  I don't know how to do it.  Very, very much.  And I even have, like, bought the little monitor you can watch on the back.  Oh, you got...  Oh, very nice.  Yes, yes.  You need the little screen so you see what you're doing.  I don't know what to do.  Aw.  My GoPro's old.  I gotta update mine.  Yeah, this one just came out.  Here, lift that up.  The three.  Yes.  It's not this big.  This is the piece on the back that I...  Yeah, no, I know. 
[00:51:30]  Wow, that's...  Oh, man, yeah.  Yes, the three.  I gotta throw that on my bike this spring.  I bought the suction thing for the window, but you need two GoPros to do that, though,  right?  Um, no, one is pretty good.  You could get you.  Yeah.  As you're driving.  You just put it in the middle.  Yeah, give a little interview.  Yeah, but how do you see this traffic, too, obviously, if you want to do that?  Oh, that you would need, too, yeah.  If I want to say something like, hey, where'd you get your license, in a Cracker Jack box  or something?  Fucking cocksucker.  Damn.  Driving with chipper.  That would be a good one, driving with the chipper. 
[00:52:00]  I would rule.  It's gonna happen.  I want to see that.  Fuck yeah.  Yeah, cocksucker, go slower.  What are you, what are you, driving like a bunch of turtles or something?  That's a good one.  I know.  You fucking got a lot of them.  That's gonna be my big one, season one finale.  All right, let's see some stuff.  Will you show me how to use it?  Yes, sure, Jimmy.  Eat your cup of noodle.  I'll eat my little cup of noodles.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:52:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Standing in the dark, it's a path.  Trying to get to Holland and France.  Uh-oh.  We're celebrating this?  Yeah.  You've gotta go back.  Hey, now, ding, ding, ding.  Give us a chance.  Right, you know it ain't easy.  Beep, beep, beep.  What is this about, Mr. Rock?  You got the marriage 44 years ago.  Oh, yeah?  The John and Yoko marriage. 
[00:53:00]  Wow.  44 years ago today.  Fucked up the Beatles, that woman.  Some say.  I'm one of them.  Some say that shit.  She's terrible.  He did start dragging her around to everything, so I'm sure that didn't help.  Yeah, they couldn't do anything.  Even the super jams.  Dragged her to that fucking thing.  That fucking circus documentary that Jay Moore turned me on to, I love it. 
[00:53:30]  There's one thing where they're playing with Chuck Berry or something, and she fucking starts  chortling like that.  She did that a few times.  Chuck Berry makes a face at John Lennon.  Like, real quick, he turns like, what the fuck is that?  His face speaks volumes.  Of course it does.  You know, his brother Marvin.  Marvin.  His cousin, Marvin Berry, told him all about rock and roll, how to play it.  It's amazing.  Rock and Roll Circus is a great documentary.  Everyone's fucking tripped out on all sorts of shit. 
[00:54:00]  And then near the end, is this the Chuck Berry one or the Rock and Roll Circus one?  Rock and Roll Circus.  Yeah, Rock and Roll Circus.  This is a super jam going on.  I forget exactly who's playing.  Clapton's on stage.  You got everybody.  And then fucking John Lennon gets Yoka to do these weird vocals.  And some say that's art.  Who am I to say what art is, but... 
[00:54:30]  Just because she took some John Lennon jizz.  It's a cat.  It's a dying cat.  Yeah, they allowed it.  Could have been a great moment.  Now it's just laughable.  I can't remember.  I think you had one of the Hendrix guys.  You had...  From the Jimi Hendrix experience.  I believe you had one of the Who guys.  You had Lennon.  Terrible.  I think Clapton was up on that stage. 
[00:55:00]  And then she wails.  She wails through the whole thing.  That was 44 years ago today.  Damn.  She could have taken the bullet.  She could have fucking done some Secret Service move.  Taking that fucking bullet.  Dive in front.  Yeah.  Do something.  Make a move.  You've been an American hero.  Yeah.  Rogan's in a little bit of trouble or what?  What the fuck?  For speaking the truth?  Well...  I've been following this...  I've been following this... 
[00:55:30]  I've been following this transgender fighter thing.  I mean...  She still looks like a fucking man.  Man.  It's a man.  She started out as a man.  She's now a woman.  And she's fighting other women in the cage.  Yeah.  I don't know about that.  I feel weird about that.  Because there's a physical difference.  There is a physical difference.  There's absolutely a physical difference.  And that's what Rogan was saying.  And then a bunch of these trannies start...  Hey, hey!  What?  The transgenders, right?  No, I'm saying tranny.  A bunch of these trannies started... 
[00:56:00]  That looks like...  That's a man body.  Wow.  Yeah, man.  The muscles are still bigger than most women.  They got upset because Joe Rogan was saying it's still a man.  And they're like, no, you don't know.  You're talking from ignorant...  They love calling people ignorant and not being accepting.  And this is...  You just don't...  No, it's a man.  But the bottom line is...  Man muscles.  Look at the arms.  You would swear that is a man's arms.  No matter what else is going on there. 
[00:56:30]  Transsexuals should be able to fight, but they should fight other transsexuals.  Right.  Because you still have the strength.  It's not about being a man.  It's about having that...  A transsexual has much more the physical strength of a man than the physical strength of a woman.  And we don't know shit, but it just seems that way, right?  Trust me.  Is that a pure...  Is that a pure transsexual?  Like, balls removed, dick turned inside out, made a vagina?  What?  Or is it like...  Or is it just a...  They do that?  To my knowledge, he's post-op transgender. 
[00:57:00]  Post-op.  All right.  Well, why don't we go to the Joe Rogan podcast?  The Joe Rogan experience.  Because this is where they got the clip from.  TMZ got the clip.  Joe, what do you think about that tranny that's trying to fight in the MMA?  I was going to bring it up.  Yeah.  There's a...  Well, she calls herself a woman.  Diamond Dave.  Yeah.  I...  Yeah, Diamond Dave is part of this clip, and TMZ doesn't even acknowledge that he's part  of the clip.  David Lee Roth is in on the conversation.  Our pal, Diamond David Lee Roth. 
[00:57:30]  Was he announcing more tour dates?  Looks like...  What's his name from the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air?  Oh, right on.  Yeah, Carlton.  That's the pre-op and post-op, huh?  I don't know.  That's a guy.  There's still some manly things going on.  Yeah.  Who do we just say?  I mean, Rogan's an expert on some of this shit, so let's see what he has to say.  But I tend to disagree.  And she used to be a man, but now she's a transgender, which is an official term that 
[00:58:00]  means you've gone through it, right?  And she wants to be able to fight women in MMA.  I say no fucking way.  I say if you had a dick at one point in time, you also have all the bone structure that  comes with having a dick.  You have bigger hands.  You have bigger shoulder joints.  You're a fucking man.  And that's her right there.  That's a man.  Okay?  You can't have...  I don't care if you don't have a dick anymore. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, that looks like a guy's carriage there, right?  Yeah.  You can't fight women.  That's fucking crazy.  I don't know why she thinks that she's going to be able to do that.  But if you want to be a woman in the bedroom and you want to play house and all that other  shit and you feel like your body is really a woman's body trapped inside a man's frame  and so you've got an operation, that's all good in the hood.  But you can't fight chicks.  Get the fuck out of here. 
[00:59:00]  You're out of your mind.  You need to fight men.  You know, period.  You need to fight men your size because you're a man.  You're a man without a dick.  That's why they're pissed at him.  The points he's making about the fighting are correct.  He broke it down perfectly, though.  Yeah.  He really did.  He's saying, you're a man without a dick and they look at themselves.  Like, the transsexuals don't look at themselves as men without dicks.  But he was looking at it in a purely physical way.  But he's making some great points, you know, the hands are bigger, the fucking shoulder 
[00:59:30]  joints are bigger.  Right.  No matter what.  And he was saying, like, their bone structure in general is bigger.  And he's right.  You're a man without a dick.  Just because you don't have a dick doesn't mean that you're, that was a great point about  your shoulder joints and all these things.  But then he's like, would you want to.  You can't change all that.  They're mad at him.  Go ahead.  Because he said, like, play house and in the bedroom.  And they would look at, like, that's not just what it is.  And that's, that's why.  I'm just saying that's probably why they're giving him shit.  I like it.  But his points about fighting are 100% right.  And then he continues. 
[01:00:00]  She looks like she's really in shape there.  Look, she's huge.  She's not just huge.  She's got a fucking man's face.  I mean, you can wear all the lipstick you want.  You know, you want to be a woman and you want to take female hormones.  You want to get a boob job.  That's all fine.  I support your life to live, your right to live as a woman.  What about her fighting guys then?  Fight guys.  Yes.  She has to fight guys.  It's not, first of all, she's not really a she.  She's a transgender post-op person.  So she's supposedly after the operation. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  The operation doesn't change.  Boosy, boosy, boosy.  It doesn't change.  You look at a man's hands and you look at a woman's hands and they're built different.  They're just thicker.  They're stronger.  Let's go out with man hands.  Your wrists are thicker.  Your elbows are thicker.  Your joints are thicker.  I just love lobster.  Just the mechanical function of punching.  A man can do it much harder than a woman can.  Period.  Joe Rogan knows that world.  He's very right.  He knows that shit.  Yeah.  He and I could have done six hours on this.  But he's correct. 
[01:01:00]  I mean, that's...  He knows all that shit.  That's not why he...  I guarantee that's not what their beef is.  Because that's right.  Their beef is misplaced.  Yeah.  I think their beef is misplaced.  You've got to really listen and put in context, again, what Joe is saying.  He's not bashing them for not being a woman after the fact, mentally perhaps, whatever your  ambition is to be a woman.  He's not saying that. 
[01:01:30]  He's saying your body was still born male and there are differences between a male body  and a female body.  That won't go away no matter what you cut off.  And we...  And we...  And again, Joe's an alpha male guy.  And this is...  You know, he's in a fight world.  Like, what bothers me about this is they're annoyed at him because he didn't speak with  enough sensitivity.  Right.  Right.  And it's like, he's not trying to be harsh or a jerk.  He's just trying to break it down.  I love it.  Here's how they're looking at it. 
[01:02:00]  And I'm guessing...  But this is...  They're looking at it like they're black.  And he said, hey, you can put on your suit and walk into a white world and try to get  a job, but you're still black.  Like, that's how they're seeing it.  That's my broadcast.  Well, you know what?  Tough shit.  But I'm just telling you.  No, I know.  But that's what I would say to those people.  Tough shit.  He's also trying to entertain people.  They're looking at it like...  It's an entertainment program.  He's not on CNN, even though I think all those fucking shows are a joke as well.  But, you know, it's entertaining.  It's a comic.  They have no... 
[01:02:30]  They can't have an argument.  Oh, they're making it about this, but they can't have an argument.  Right.  That's what he said about fighting was correct.  And the fact that he said the other stuff wasn't mean.  It wasn't intended to be mean.  It's just the way he sees it.  He knows the sport, and he's also a comic, and he's trying to entertain his podcast audience.  And he did all three things very well there.  Joe's never danced around issues to...  No, no.  Like, if he has an idea on his head, it just comes out.  Right.  It's beautiful.  So where are we at with the controversy?  Is it getting bad, or is it just kind of out there? 
[01:03:00]  That's more Twitter and TMZ.  TMZ.  TMZ picked it up.  Yeah, TMZ picked it up, but I haven't seen it gone past TMZ.  All right, so he's probably all right.  No one's really jumping on board with the transgender people.  That's how you know that they're getting there, but they're not fucking there.  Yeah, they're not there yet.  No celebrities have transsexual girlfriends.  Man, that looks like a guy.  Oh.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, yeah.  You get gay celebrities and lesbians, but you don't have any that have a transsexual girlfriend.  The one fight where the guy who's now a chick, you know, they're showing this one fight he had or she had with the other person. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  That other person looks pretty manly, too, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, when they first did the story and they showed the two fighters, I wasn't really sure which one was the, you know, used to be the guy.  That's insulting, Opie.  That's insensitive.  Is that the other one?  Yeah.  Wow.  That looks like a guy, too.  That looks like a fucking dude.  Okay.  I don't know.  Like, if it's just post-op or transsexuals fighting, I have no issue with that. 
[01:04:00]  But I think he's right.  You can't fight women because your arms are bigger.  It's an unfair advantage.  Of course it is.  Don't you think?  Yeah.  They can't even do, they don't even, they still have a men and women's champion for chess.  Like, why?  Why?  That you don't need.  There's a men and women's champion for tennis.  Mm-hmm.  Which, all right, maybe.  Well, tennis, of course there should be.  But I'm saying, that's not hand-to-hand combat.  That's just it, yeah, for tennis.  I mean.  There's a reason there's a difference physically between them. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That looks like a dude.  And we're not talking about the one that used to be a dude.  Wasn't there a tranny tennis player?  Yeah, Renee Richards.  Renee Richards.  Did Renee Richards play male or female?  I think she, he, whatever, went male for a while.  Male tournaments, yeah.  Did they allow it?  I don't know.  I mean, they didn't have the surgery figured out back then.  She kind of looked like Herman Munster out there.  Yeah, yeah.  With duct tape. 
[01:05:00]  In a tennis outfit.  She looked horrendous.  They've come a long way with that surgery.  What's the story of Renee Richards?  I think that's like late 70s, early 80s, right?  Yeah, she underwent sex.  In 75, she underwent sex reassignment surgery.  Would you want to go through that surgery in 75?  They didn't know anything.  The middle ages.  Driving Fort Pinto's in 75.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  So then she was denied entry into the 76th U.S. Open by the Tennis Association, citing an unprecedented women-born-women policy that she disputed. 
[01:05:30]  And the New York Supreme Court ruled in her favor in 1977.  So she did continue.  Wait.  So then she got to go back in.  Against women?  Wait.  Did she start as a...  She started as a man.  Dude.  A dude.  And then she was able to be reassigned as a woman.  And then in 77, the Supreme Court said she could get back in. 
[01:06:00]  See, that's a fucking...  I don't agree with that.  Like, as much as...  Believe me, I'm pro-transsexual.  But I don't believe in that because there is a physical difference.  Even if you're not classified as a man anymore, and legally you're not, and even maybe morally, you see yourself as this, and you've had hormones, and it's...  You still have bone structure.  That's a great point.  Yeah, Rogan made a great point there.  Bone structure.  Bone structure.  Her surgery was so horrendous, I forgot if she was born a woman or a man during this conversation.  I have to go on record and say that. 
[01:06:30]  Wait.  She was born a man.  She was born a man.  She still looked like a man after the surgery.  She was born Richard Raskin.  Yeah, okay.  And she became Renee Richards.  And then she was allowed to compete with other women.  Correct.  But she never really won anything.  No, you could be strong or you might be shitty.  Look at that.  Wow.  Looks like the redhead from Sex and the City.  That fucking hairdo.  Oh, that is really horrendous.  She's almost male pattern baldness. 
[01:07:00]  Yes.  Who does she have hair like?  Who does that hair look like?  That wispy.  Der Crow.  Yeah, but who does that got that wispy fucking dude?  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Wow.  She has hair like the guy who tortured Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon.  Yeah.  The Asian guy.  All right.  It just started looking like an old woman.  But old men start looking like old women.  Sure, because we...  I don't think that had anything to do with anything.  Start losing our fucking... 
[01:07:30]  Is that the earlier picture?  Oh, my God.  That's just the...  Oh, God.  With the horrendous implants.  Giant tits.  We don't know how to make fake tits yet.  No.  1975 picture.  Yeah, they gasoline in them.  Yeah, basically they did.  They just didn't know what the fuck they were doing.  I don't...  Oh, God.  Now glamour shots are popping up.  In a brar.  Brar.  She looks like John Lithgow in Garp or something, right? 
[01:08:00]  World According to Garp, right?  Yeah, a little bit.  Joe's not in trouble, per se, right?  No.  TMZ is trying to get some shit going, though.  Wow, those vultures.  Javi.  You see his question every day on Twitter?  No.  He just likes getting in everyone's business.  It's just...  Is he in everyone's business?  Go to his Twitter.  It tries to be in everyone's business.  He has a question every day.  What do you think, man?  It's always somebody's personal shit that he just has to get his nose in. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  I'm a vulture.  What do you think?  Yeah.  Can you give me one that works?  It's every day.  Because I guess he does that TMZ Live, and he wants to get people, you know, talking.  He wants to get a buzz start.  All right.  Do you got to go on?  Watch what was this?  It tries to be nuts.  Michael Jackson's family don't ask, who's the daddy?  Should paternity evidence be allowed in this case?  Yes.  Well, I'm a legal expert, so we're not coming on this on Twitter.  They get worse than that. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  Tiger Woods' ex-mistress, I bet he's already cheating on Lindsey Vonn.  Do you think Tiger's a changed man?  Why or why not?  Just kidding.  Everyone's just...  Hey.  Well, I don't know Tiger personally, but...  I'm just asking questions.  Yeah, what a douche.  Oh, you...  Fucking douchebag.  Cock blocker.  What a fucking cock blocker he is.  He's the face of that whole fucking industry.  I can't stand it.  That whole vulturous...  Just making your fucking bones on other people's carcasses. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, you got another one?  Yeah.  These are great.  Ryan Seacrest and Julianne Hough call it quits.  Was Ryan's hectic work scheduled to blame, or was it something else?  Hey, Harvey Levin.  Hey, Harvey Levin, you fucking asshole.  You know the rumors, so why don't you get really brave and fucking talk about Ryan Seacrest?  Why?  Just ask the question.  You piece of shit.  Not that brave, are you?  There's all sorts of rumors about him.  Why don't you go down that road, Harvey, if you want to get in everyone's business? 
[01:10:00]  Harv?  Yeah, he's a...  With that said, it's none of fucking Harvey Levin's business, but he plays in that stupid world.  He certainly does.  You got another one?  Harvey.  You don't like the wacky bits they do on the show?  Dude, what's up?  And now, another version of the show.  You know, when it first popped, I kind of liked TMZ.  When it first did, but now they're just...  I don't know what they're doing.  Yeah.  And why is Lindsay Lohan getting all these fucking second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, 
[01:10:30]  seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth chances?  You know, they gave her that big rehab sentence, and they could have thrown her in jail.  And that night, she's trying to get into a fucking club.  Yeah.  So why wouldn't they just drag her back in and say, all right, you know what, we're taking  our offer back.  We're locking you up.  She does get a lot of breaks.  It's all she gets is breaks.  It's amazing.  Why, though?  Does anyone know?  No idea.  Just a coddled baby.  Is she just blowing everyone around her, and they're looking the other way? 
[01:11:00]  And she didn't want to take a rehab deal.  Well, she...  But I was reading today, she has to do 90 days in lockup rehab, meaning she can't fucking leave.  And I found out on the paper today, she has 45 days to figure out where she wants to go.  Why wouldn't the court go, you're doing 90 days, you know, lockup rehab, and you're  starting tomorrow, and this is where you're going?  Because she has a better lawyer than they do. 
[01:11:30]  She has a better lawyer than the state.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah, and she's a coddled dude.  And she continues to just throw the finger up at the whole system.  She was trying to get into a club that night.  Something bad will happen with that.  Court appearance.  She'll plow into somebody, or something really shitty will happen, because she's suffering  almost no consequences.  She got off the airplane she was on before it pushed back.  Yeah.  She got off, left her luggage.  Yeah.  And she said she left because she thought she saw oil on the plane.  Yeah.  And she left and went to a club. 
[01:12:00]  Went to a club, and then was an hour late, and they were cool with that.  If any of us were an hour late for a court appearance, we'd be so fucked.  Oh, man.  Dunsky.  Uh, you got another one?  I got a couple more questions, yeah.  All right, go ahead.  Gwyneth Paltrow reveals she avoids giving her children carbohydrates.  Should parents put their kids on diets?  Why or why not?  Why or why not?  Let's make judgments on how this person raises their carbohydrates.  Right, right.  Let me get in your shit.  Yeah, let's get into Harvey Levin's shit. 
[01:12:30]  What a bore this guy.  Fucking just an...  This one.  You guys will probably all have informed opinions on this.  Liam and Miley's split reports won't stop.  Do you think they called it quits, or are they still going strong?  It's just getting in everyone's...  You know who he is?  He is absolutely devoid of substance.  He's a non-contributor.  Harvey Levin is a non-contributor.  Well, he's a multi-millionaire. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, he's a smart guy.  He's not a dumb guy.  Because of this, easily.  He's made millions off this TMZ thing.  It's his whole...  It's his baby.  It's his idea.  It's his thing.  But he creates nothing.  Go ahead, Sam.  Michael Bay and Megan Fox to resolve differences.  Do you think it's time to bury the hatchet?  Share your thoughts.  I read these every afternoon.  Share your thoughts.  They come in around 2, 3 in the afternoon, every day.  Wow.  The Harvey Levin question.  He is a tool. 
[01:13:30]  How would anybody have any point of reference to Michael Bay and Megan Fox's relationship?  Give me a fuck about them like that.  How could a person have a real opinion on that?  Well, you might not think you do until you read him and go, well, you know what?  Do they or don't they?  Let me do a little research on this.  I should look into this.  There you go.  Oh, boy.  There you go.  Wow.  Amazing, right?  Kristen Cavallari claims, my Hills co-stars were bribed to lie about my drug use. 
[01:14:00]  What do you believe?  Why?  I believe that.  No idea because I wasn't there.  I believe it's none of your goddamn business.  None of your goddamn business.  I think that's what I believe, Harvey.  Boy, he sure pumps these things out, though, huh?  Every day.  There's a couple.  Justin Bieber's rep, Scooter Braun, says there's nothing wrong with him. 
[01:14:30]  Do you agree?  Or has Biebs gone off the rails?  But what would your opinion be based on?  Nothing.  None of us are even...  Nobody's even remotely close to the situation.  Not even close.  If somebody in the situation says everything's fine, all right, everything's fine.  Everything's fine.  Yeah, who are you to know more?  Do you think they're lying?  He just figures out poke his nose in their business.  Yeah.  Let me...  And bring the rest of us along.  Hey, everybody.  What do you think?  What's wrong with him?  What do you think?  And then when that person says what they think, I would go, well, what is that based on? 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  By the way, pay no attention to what I do in my life.  Just look at them.  Look at them over there.  What do you think?  Oh, my God.  Why?  Show your work.  Show your work, yes.  Do you think so or not?  Please explain.  It's every day.  I've been on this trip for a long time, though.  Write a paragraph about it.  You got one more?  He only accepts tweets that rephrase the question in the answer.  One more, maybe?  No.  Oh.  Let's see. 
[01:15:30]  God, am I stupid?  I'm stupid.  He does?  Oh, Matt Lauer.  Today, NBC handled Ann Curry crisis badly.  Do you agree with Matt?  Tell us.  Why or why not?  Because we were all back there in the NBC boardrooms figuring out...  Exactly.  Well, you know what?  I think Blotto98 on Twitter has a terrific Twitter bit today.  He just tweeted, Harvey Levin TMZ.  To take one in the ass or not, what do you think? 
[01:16:00]  You think people should maybe...  Maybe ask Harvey one of these goofy questions today.  Philadelphia Eagles cheerleaders say, we want Paris Jackson.  Does Paris have what it takes?  Does she?  Well, the public is informed.  I'm going to say no.  All right, my pal Pretty Plus More on the Twitter.  Now I'm enraged again.  And Sam would know.  She writes, try, just try Opio Radio. 
[01:16:30]  Thank you.  To listen to the TMZ show on Sirius XM.  Oh, yeah.  They gave him a show, too?  Yeah, of course they did.  And she writes, dare you.  I bet you could take two minutes tops.  Nine people speak simultaneously.  They have a fucking show here as well?  Well, I think what they did was they do the TMZ live show on their website.  Right.  And Sirius was like, if we give you some money, can we have that gold that you guys put on the Internet every day on our service?  Because we have so much time to give out to people. 
[01:17:00]  We have time slots.  We have nobody to put in these shows.  And we figure you don't do radio.  You'd be great for a show.  Why don't we know about any of these shows?  Because nobody listens to them.  Well, that's...  Nobody.  True.  It was a loaded question, Sam.  Right.  You should have played along a little bit.  It was a loaded question.  Of course that's the answer.  We don't know about any of these shows because no one gives a fuck.  No one.  So why do we continue giving out these dumb little shows to everybody?  Not one person has subscribed to listen to Harvey Levin ask questions about other people's lives. 
[01:17:30]  You know, instead of giving this show a podcast, they're obsessed with content control and being territorial.  I'm going to start laughing again.  Sorry.  But they're not worried about being territorial about something like that because it's really bizarre.  It makes no sense.  But he asks the important questions.  Chris Brown.  Yeah.  I don't really own Rihanna's lady parts.  It was just a song lyric.  Oh.  Do you think Chris was only joking? 
[01:18:00]  No.  He really owns her lady parts.  Why?  Talk amongst yourselves.  And this is why Harvey Levin stinks.  Because he's not brave enough to say things.  He just asks them.  He doesn't want to say it himself.  Because he wants to be able to hang out with these people in Hollywood.  That's why.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Here's a perfect example of what Jim was just talking about.  Yeah.  Instead of going on and saying Justin Bieber is obviously on a downward spiral.  Out of control.  He's fucked up.  Sure. 
[01:18:30]  He's a publicity stunt like you said.  His tweet was, Justin Bieber, two hours late to his show, collapses on stage, flips out on a photog.  What do you think of his latest behavior?  Yeah.  It's your Twitter.  What do you think of his behavior?  Yeah.  Your Twitter is your dumb opinions.  Like them or not.  Give your opinions.  Some people will agree.  Some people will disagree.  Yep.  How many followers do you have?  He knows what that's about.  Justin Bieber's an asshole.  Figured he could get away with going on stage two hours late. 
[01:19:00]  Realized he got horrendous negative publicity.  So the next day or two days later, he collapses on stage to try to turn the publicity around.  And then he makes believe he's a tough guy going into his car.  I bet he's having panic attacks or something.  Something's happening with him where he's gotten sick twice on stage.  I'll bet you he's going through some kind of fear or panic.  Did he actually get sick on stage?  Did we actually see him throw up?  Yeah, he did.  We did see the throw up.  And there's another time where he's gotten sick.  I bet you something's happening where he's freaking out.  What are you guys doing?  Present the question.  That's right.  Don't give an opinion.  Do you guys out there think that he's just having some panic attacks? 
[01:19:30]  Or not.  Or not.  Could be either.  588,000 followers.  I think he discovered the dope.  Yeah.  I think the Biebs discovered the weed.  Do you think Justin Bieber may have discovered drugs?  Why?  Why?  What makes you think that?  Does he ever give an opinion on his TMZ Twitter there?  Or is it all these weird questions?  It's all questions.  It's just asking questions.  It's all headlines. 
[01:20:00]  We're just asking questions.  Just asking questions.  Like Troy Quant.  Right.  Got to question everything.  Troy says, we don't know what happened on N11.  Oh, God.  We do, Troy.  Yeah, we do.  Stop.  Funky Bunch to Mark Wahlberg.  Reunion would be amazing.  What do you think of the group doing a reunion?  You can't even say the Funky Bunch is stupid.  Yeah.  It's the Funky Bunch.  Right.  God, he's a real fucking, I mean, you know, it's not even evil. 
[01:20:30]  It's just, it's irritatingly non-contributing.  An opinionless, fucking, uh, substanceless guy.  It's our little world we live in.  He basically just takes everything everybody else is doing and, uh, attempts to somehow  capitalize on it.  Right.  Mm-hmm.  Lisa Vanderpump versus Adrian Maloof.  Restaurant war.  Whose side are you on?  Why?  Whose side am I on?  Wait, what?  Exactly.  There's a restaurant war with who? 
[01:21:00]  Don't know these people.  Who knew?  Lisa Vanderpump.  Well, of course.  From Vanderpump Rules.  Yeah, I know that.  But I don't know who Adrian Maloof is.  She's from Beverly Hills, uh, Real Housewives.  Real Housewives.  Look out.  Yes.  I wouldn't have known that.  But she's leaving the show.  I wouldn't know.  I was, I just read something.  Terrence Howard says, Oprah's sex scene was a dream come true.  Those tig old biddies.  Were his comments appropriate?  Why?  Tig old biddy. 
[01:21:30]  What?  Wait, Terrence Howard had a, had a love scene with Oprah?  Yeah, did you hear about this?  No.  They call them big old titties and tig old biddies.  Yeah.  Well, he speaks backwards.  That's more of his backwards shit.  Those tig old biddies.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, it was, uh, it went, uh, all over the place last week or a week and a half ago.  Mm-hmm.  But, no, you can check out Harvey and his buddies on the Daily here on SiriusXN.  On the Daily?  What channel are they on?  I have no clue.  I'll look it up.  Oh, the Daily's a good channel.  Yeah.  Daily's a good channel.  Is that the name of the channel? 
[01:22:00]  No.  Who knows?  I made that up.  Oh.  Oh, Jimmy.  Where are all these shows?  I think he's getting better, guys.  Huh?  Oh.  Oh, it certainly is.  That's good.  Yeah.  Stars, it looks like.  Yeah, Stars.  Weekdays at 10 p.m. Eastern.  Supposedly we're going to finally get an hour on one of the Sirius channels, I was told  yesterday.  You know why?  You know why we got, we're going to finally get it?  Because we did bitch.  So, some of the bitching does get things done.  Does it?  Yeah.  Because they were, they were. 
[01:22:30]  Or doesn't it?  Well, that's a very good question.  What do you guys think?  Management or opening Anthony?  I don't think we would have continued in the talk stage, but I think our bitching yesterday  pushed something forward.  Supposedly we're going to get an hour on the weekends.  I don't know when it starts.  On the weekends.  That's what I said.  But then he said, no, man.  A lot of people listen on the weekends.  Didn't I?  Just put an hour on the fucking...  Everything has to be just a fucking...  It's a fucking little case.  It can't just be the thing.  It always has to be over thought.  A little dog shit variation of everything. 
[01:23:00]  It's a dog shit variation of everything.  Dog shit variation.  Because I'm like, oh, that's good news.  It's always good news followed with, but why that?  Or why the weekends?  It's close to good news.  I think he said Sunday morning at 11 a.m.  That fucking...  Is that a good time?  No, it's not.  No, it's not a good time.  He says it is.  For our demo.  He says it is.  I know he does.  Sunday morning at 11?  I believe that's what he said. 
[01:23:30]  That is not a good time.  It's a great time for the Pope's show.  Yes.  I could have looked him in the eye yesterday as we were walking, but he...  And I was walking really fast, so...  It's like they're doing us a favor.  He said, I think it's Sunday mornings at 11, and I think it's...  I think he said an hour.  He might have said two.  I'm not really sure.  They treat us like they're doing us this favor.  Like, hey, we'll get you something.  Yeah, we'll get you Sunday.  It's 11.  On some new channel, too, I think.  Oh, sure.  That's the best place for it.  Why go somewhere to stop? 
[01:24:00]  Why put a little bit on the comedy channel?  Yeah, I don't know why we're not connected with the comedy channel.  We sort of have all the guys in here, and we've never had a connection with the comedy channel.  I mean, the promotion department could start there.  That's a no-brainer, but...  It's not going to happen.  I don't know.  I don't know what I'm talking about anymore.  I used to know what I was talking about.  I used to really understand shit, but I don't anymore.  I'll be honest.  I don't have a fucking clue.  The indie channel is where we're going to be on, I think.  Oh.  Maybe we're not even supposed to announce it.  The indie channel?  I don't think you are.  Why?  Is that the one where Dr. Jones just talks about his exploits? 
[01:24:30]  Imagine.  That's all it is.  How great.  So there I was.  I wouldn't be surprised.  And I tried to make a counterweight with sand in a bag, and I grabbed the gold and...  I grabbed the gold, uh...  head there, and I threw it to the fucking...  the guy from Boogie Nights.  That's the channel they're trying to reinvent, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah, the indie channel.  Is that used to be Stars 2 or something?  Yeah, Covino and Rich and Jay Thomas are still on, and then they added Pete Dominick and 
[01:25:00]  gave it a horrible name, and so it's indie.  Why?  Indie is pretty hip, and now.  What?  Indie?  What?  Indie's pretty hip now, Sam.  Are we having this conversation in 92?  No, I'm telling you, it's pretty hip now.  It is?  Yeah, indie.  You're going to start hearing that word a lot.  Is that?  Yeah.  It's on the come up?  Yeah.  You're going to start hearing, like, bands use it.  Indie.  Nightclubs and stuff.  Indie!  And comedy shows.  They're going to really fucking jump on this word.  Not to be confused with the indie rock channel, correct? 
[01:25:30]  Or is that what this is?  What's indie rock channel?  Sirius XMU.  We're going to Sirius XMU?  Oh, my God.  Indie.  I would think indie would be, yeah, they would play, like, old indie rock from the 90s  or something.  Which is now considered classic rock.  Classic rock.  Anything over, I think, 20 years in radio is classic rock.  So we're going to be on a classic rock channel.  So, like, everything from 93 at this point is, believe it or not, considered classic rock.  Mm-hmm.  And indie, what?  That term only, that's only been around a couple of years, I guess, so. 
[01:26:00]  What?  A couple of decades would be the answer.  No, no, no.  Are you sure?  Yeah, no.  I really don't think it said...  No, I think R.E.M. started using that term at the end of their careers.  End?  Yeah, I think so, yeah.  Once they were famous.  Because before that, it was just called college radio, I think.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, no, indie's new.  Because they figured, you know, college radio's getting kind of old.  That's an old term.  So they went, you know what, let's, you know, let's make college radio now indie.  And they did this after R.E.M. was famous. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, late in their careers, before the bank kind of called it quits.  Dang, dang.  I think indie's been around maybe five years.  Maybe.  I think it means independent.  Yeah, but the first couple of years, no one really knew.  Does it?  No, of course it does.  It's been in the forefront of pop culture for maybe three, I would say.  Three?  Yeah.  So you don't think it was associated with, like, Tarantino and Kevin Smith?  Not at all.  20 years ago?  Nope.  Those were, that was like the independent era.  That was cool. 
[01:27:00]  Independent films, yes.  This is indie.  But is it college rock or indie?  Because this would.  This was college back in its day.  They used to call it college rock or college radio, but now it's called indie.  It was before indie.  Yeah.  Pre-indie.  Yeah.  Indie's a new term.  New.  Yeah, of course it is.  Take with the sun.  Carry a compass to help you along.  Your feet are going to be on the ground.  Everybody in the video is doing that wacky little dance. 
[01:27:30]  Thumbs up or down.  I like this song.  It was always a catchy little ditty.  What about, yeah, where does alternative fit in to indie?  Alternative is a relatively new term as well.  Yes.  Alt.  Yeah, alt.  Alt rock.  Oh, that's a good idea.  That's what they should do with that.  Yeah, yeah.  It's pretty new.  Holy fuck.  All the kids are saying it.  So I guess we're going to be on indie.  I don't need to wait around for some dumb press release that no one's going to read. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, you weren't supposed to talk about this.  Who gives a fuck?  We wanted more.  They're going to give us an hour, so I guess we should be thankful.  On Sunday morning 11.  Yeah, because that's a...  Well, Sunday morning at 8 a.m. in L.A.  Because you want L.A. drive time.  Oh, God.  Because you can't have L.A. drive time.  Sunday morning at 8 a.m.  That's a prime spot in L.A.  Yeah, people wake up.  All the movers and shakers are out.  They wake up early in L.A.  They're going to church.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Headed church.  Listen to the O&A show.  God-fearing people in Los Angeles. 
[01:28:30]  Man, they so don't wake up early in L.A.  No.  In L.A.  In San Francisco and San Diego.  Oh, my God.  Oh, they so don't wake up early.  They've been rolling on the molly.  That's right.  On the zero.  They're on the molly.  On the zero.  Yeah, I mean, I don't even know if all the...  We weren't supposed to announce that?  Why?  I think some of the staff affected by it on Indy have not...  Really?  Beat it, stupid.  We're taking your hour.  Okay.  Who cares?  Who's that? 
[01:29:00]  Huh?  She's some actress.  Oh, I thought she was a host on Indy.  Mm-mm.  She's very pretty.  Are you happy with our hour?  Yeah, it's terrific.  It's a really terrific thing.  I think it's good.  I asked for four.  Yeah.  And I asked for a few different channels.  We get an hour Sunday morning.  And maybe not Sunday morning.  On Indy.  Yeah, it's a great time.  No, no, I disagree.  I think that's the perfect opportunity to get those people really excited about the show.  Oh, yeah.  Podcasts are very old news.  The Indy label. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  Because who wants to do a podcast?  Why would you give away content?  Stop.  You can't give away content.  Now you're just talking crazy.  Plus, podcasts seem so dependent.  Yes.  You know what I mean?  Yes, please.  Yeah, it's just such a silly...  You are independent.  Exactly.  Podcasts are stupid.  Because that would expose you to all these people for, say, an hour a week.  And then they might actually get the service for it.  Why would you do that when you could have an hour in the morning?  All kidding aside, I had that meeting, too. 
[01:30:00]  Which morning?  We need to be in the iTunes world, because everyone's going on iTunes and checking out  podcasts every single day.  I go, give us an hour.  Just let us put an hour on iTunes.  It could be material that we know we're not going to play anytime soon, because we have  a huge catalog.  You can't be making knee-jerk decisions, Opie, based on a medium that's probably just a fad.  Let's see how long it lasts.  That was...  Early December had that meeting.  Oh.  And what's happened? 
[01:30:30]  It's three and a half months late.  Has Bob jumped on it?  No.  No one jumps on it.  Oh.  They're in the...  We're talking about it stage.  Everything is in a talking about it stage.  Everything.  How many things are being talked about?  There's so many things that are being talked about.  Is the wall officially not being talked about anymore?  That's off the table now.  Off the table.  The wall is off the table.  Let's not talk about it anymore.  If I didn't have a family, I'd go home and cry every day.  Wouldn't you?  I don't care.  You don't want to upset the family either. 
[01:31:00]  I don't care.  Imagine if Daddy came home crying every day.  I'd be so frustrated.  That'd be terrible.  I got other things to do with my time now.  Thank God.  Yeah.  And I try.  Every once in a while, I try.  I got some little ideas for the show, and they just fucking sit there.  They sit there.  They're not even talking about cameras in the studio.  That's not even in the talking stage.  That's not being talked about.  The podcast thing has been in the talking stage for officially three and a half months. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  Officially.  The bus tour has officially been in the talking stage for close to a year.  Talking about it.  The wall was talked about for a month.  That was a quick talk about.  Yeah.  And the talking about getting some material on Sirius.  For the people that don't know, we're part of the Best of XM package, which that's so  antiquated as well.  Opie, it's an honor.  No, it's not.  It sucks for us.  Is it an honor?  Because they could open us up to so many more listeners. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  But they're being greedy, and they're squeezing us to get just a little more money from our  fan base instead of just offering it to everybody.  I think that would be value in just putting us out there for everybody.  Good news.  They don't see it that way.  Yes.  I believe it is two hours.  We're getting two.  I believe it's two hours.  Sundays.  Is it Sundays at 11?  No update on the time slot.  I believe I heard 11.  11 to 1, so that's good. 
[01:32:30]  Heading right into Sunday lunchtime, brunch time.  That's right.  Yes.  Well, we're late breakfast.  And honestly, Sundays, especially when football season hits, Sundays, 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. is  a fucking perfect time slot for us.  Perfect.  Yep.  Because no one really starts checking out their football shit at 11.  They want to tune the game in right at 1 o'clock.  Right when that kickoff starts.  They don't want to be bothered with pregame shows and their fantasy football. 
[01:33:00]  So, man, that's perfect for us.  Trust me.  I know.  I come in here and do a show on Sundays.  You want an audience?  Yes.  This weekday stuff is for the birds.  You want to be right in there with the football people.  Oh, yeah.  I love it.  Because you know what?  I've got to tell you, the people we talk to, I've learned over the years, they don't  really like football that much.  A Sunday afternoon is when you want to be broadcast.  And this asshole tells me yesterday that it's a really good time slot. 
[01:33:30]  I didn't even know what to say, so I just nodded and walked into an elevator.  Who said it?  Fucking radio wizard.  Do you know what the most underrated thing in entertainment is?  Surrounding yourself with the right people.  Oh.  Honestly, we talk about it.  I tried.  They don't want to listen to that.  I go, we have the wrong people.  Agent, publicity.  It's a whole thing.  I tried.  I said, we have the wrong people overseeing this channel.  They don't want to hear that either.  It's agent and shit like that.  Like, you know why my gigs don't get fucked up?  Honestly, like my... 
[01:34:00]  Because of Kenny.  Because I've never had a gig where the money wasn't what I thought or where my travel got  fucked up because Kenny's very competent with that.  Kenny doesn't do the money, but I mean, with the travel at least and the hotels, all right?  Right.  He never fucks up because he's good at his job.  That aspect of my career does not get fucked up.  But human contact.  He's terrible.  Yeah, that's different.  It's like having the fucking thing from Alien who got cut in half.  But it's surrounding yourself with the right people. 
[01:34:30]  And I guess the best of XM, I've heard this.  I'm a little confused by this, but I've heard.  Thank you, Matt and Virginia.  Best of XM is only for old Sirius radios, too.  If you got a new, like, Sirius radio, you can't really get best of XM.  And most people don't, you know, most people don't up fucking grade their cars or their equipment.  People want more, I say.  Right, Sam?  No one does that.  No one gets a new car.  That's stupid.  Don't give it all out at once, I say.  You have a car.  It's called trickle-down radio.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You give them it all at once, people get tired of things. 
[01:35:00]  We got to roll out slow.  We're just rolling the show out slow across the platform.  So, not only, this is how hard it is.  If you're a Sirius subscriber, and you want to listen to Opie and Anthony, you have to first go and get an old car with old Sirius equipment.  That's what you've got to do first.  But they don't make them like they used to.  Buy old car.  And then somehow you've got to stumble across the best of XM promo or commercial.  Stumble.  And then you've got to call and sign up for that.  But at least we have notoriously good customer service when you call. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, yeah.  We didn't make any lists, right?  I don't think there's a list.  Any lists?  Yeah, maybe you weren't here for that one.  We love a good list.  Sirius XM, considered one of the worst customer service.  Oh, I remember that.  Yeah, customer service.  Yes, I do remember that.  And made a top ten list.  Yep.  That was a good date, huh?  Yeah, it's terrible.  So, I mean, the Sirius subscribers, it's almost impossible, is my point, to hear us.  So, that's why it's good that we're going to be on Sunday mornings at 11 a.m.  Like I said, we're doing the comedy channel thing. 
[01:36:00]  And we just cross the entire board.  Like, you know, the comedy channel is just on both platforms.  Well, we're not really funny.  So, we don't belong there.  We're not a funny show, so we don't belong on the channel.  No, not on the channel, but I mean the same is that we kind of cross.  Just everyone listens to the comedy channel or everyone listens to Boneyard or, you know.  Yeah, but we've got to be funny first to be associated with the comedy channel.  Do Opie and Anthony belong on the comedy channel?  Your thoughts?  What do you think?  Apparently, everybody from Sirius is checking in.  No, we don't think so.  And the agent's checking in.  Who are those guys?  Sam made a list out of nowhere? 
[01:36:30]  You love lists.  What, is it my birthday?  I love a good list.  Is this how you listen to Opie and Anthony on Sirius?  Yes.  It's a list slash instructions.  And this is no joke.  For most people, this is what you have to do to listen to Opie and Anthony.  Right, go ahead.  Which is why you don't end up on the comedy channel, by the way.  No jokes.  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah, I know.  Maybe if we get them laughing, then maybe we'll be noticed by the comedy channel. 
[01:37:00]  And maybe those people go, you know what?  Maybe we should be associated with Opie and Anthony a little bit.  I've only been here four years.  Is that it?  Maybe it's time to have that conversation.  Like I said, the slow rollout.  Listening to Opie and Anthony on Sirius.  Number one, buy a very old car.  Yeah.  Right.  Two, wait for a Best of XM promo.  Right.  Three, call customer service.  Right.  Four, beg for the show and give them more money.  Right.  Uh-huh.  And five, enjoy it.  There you go. 
[01:37:30]  I like it.  Yeah.  It's like a couple of noodles.  A couple of noodles.  It's simple.  Who would go through all those steps, even if we were the greatest radio show ever?  Five simple steps.  Who would go, you know what?  I enjoy my new car, but I've got to get Opie and Anthony, so I've got to trade this in for  a clunker.  Right.  Who would do that?  A clunker.  Do you have a vehicle like this in an older model?  Dude, I would do.  I don't want the new one.  Do you have an 08?  I don't know if you know this.  I work for the company, but I have a Sirius radio in my car, and I am not going through 
[01:38:00]  the steps to get our channel in my car.  No.  Oh, it's such a good show, though.  I know, but it just feels like too much work.  Yeah, that is a lot of work.  I mean, there's five simple steps.  I think we've made it very clear for everybody.  Three simple steps.  That's all you need.  Maybe we should put this on the website.  Yeah.  And that way, if there's any questions...  No, we'll probably get in trouble for that.  Well, you guys do.  You guys always get in trouble.  You might think we're mocking them or joking.  Right.  But we're serious. 
[01:38:30]  We just want to attract listeners.  But 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. on the Indie Channel, coming soon.  Looking forward to it.  When, though?  Yeah, that was the thing.  You weren't supposed to make the announcement today.  Well, why can't they just do it starting Sunday?  I mean, I don't know.  Oh, there's things.  There's always things.  Someone asked the Radio Wizard, but he's on to us now.  I hate when he's on to us.  I like, you know, hitting him cold.  Yeah.  Why can't we start Sunday?  I need to know the answer.  You know what I mean?  Because there's going to be an answer.  Well, because the programming has to be switched, and we were going to ramp it up and roll it out 
[01:39:00]  because we wanted to have, we wanted to promote it and make it a special event.  We wanted to roll it out after a little bit of a campaign, you know, get people excited, run some ads.  I want to know why it can't start Sunday, and then I want to know when it will start, Sam Roberts.  Can we get that answer, please, as we go to break?  We got Brandon Steiner coming in today.  Very, very cool shit to give away.  He has very cool shit to give away.  Do we have any idea, like, are we going to make people do anything for stuff or just call in? 
[01:39:30]  That's a really good question.  We should have set this up better.  Yeah, of course we should have.  He's got some stuff in the office.  I know.  That's what I'm saying.  What did he bring in there, Travis?  Brandon Steiner is obviously the memorabilia guy.  Yeah.  We had a great time with him last time.  And he's here, and he's got stuff to give away.  And I asked for a couple little things, and, man, he fucking gave them to me.  Jim, too.  I got a Dan Marino autograph from my father-in-law, who loves it, and I got a Derek Jeter ball  from my little nephew, who's a big baseball kid, loves his baseball. 
[01:40:00]  I wanted the boxing thing, which didn't come, but I don't know if they sell them anymore,  because I didn't see them on the website, so they might have sold out of them.  Like, the fucking display for your boxing glove that's UV-friendly.  Did he remember that I'm a huge Pete Maravich fan, and did he bring something for me?  That's all I need to know right now.  I don't know.  Fuck.  I do have a canceled check by Pete Maravich.  But we do have some stuff to give away.  Really good stuff.  And I got my own autographs from Pete Maravich when he was still alive, when I was collecting  autographs.  You don't do that anymore?  What happened to it? 
[01:40:30]  He gave up.  He went to the bathroom, I think.  Yeah, he gave up.  You show me more of my GoPro.  Um, he's not participating.  Oh, he's not.  He won't get on the phone call.  Oh, he doesn't want to participate.  He's not participating.  Why?  Yes.  What did he say?  I'm not participating.  Oh, really?  Dude, it's a fucking radio show.  You fucking baby.  You're not going to participate, are you?  Did he actually say that?  Yes. 
[01:41:00]  And do you, do people understand why the outrage and the frustration?  It's a fucking radio show.  You do audio for a living.  This is a dumb profession.  It's a dumb job.  People work real fucking jobs and you don't want to, you don't want to participate, do  you?  Did he look mad?  He just said he wasn't participating.  Why?  It was real fucking questions.  Know why?  Because he knows the answers are horrendous. 
[01:41:30]  I think you weren't supposed to announce that today.  Who gives a shit?  Jimmy, help me out.  Who gives a shit?  It's a lousy two hours on a channel no one knows about.  The big secrets and everything's got to be rolled out.  Who gives a motherfuck about it?  And he won't participate.  No, he's not participating.  You have no idea how utterly disgusted I am. 
[01:42:00]  I mean, it's like, look, they pay me good money and I love this.  I genuinely mean that.  And I really love this.  I love doing my dumb one hour.  I love the boneyard shit.  Like the actual performance part of it is fun.  Right.  But the stuff around it is, and I'm not even shitting on Gary.  I'm just saying in general, it's just handled terribly.  And then they.  It's not going to change.  And then he doesn't want to participate.  It's not going to change.  No, I'm already talking to people.  I'm not waiting around anymore. 
[01:42:30]  I've decided a while ago I'm not waiting around anymore.  I think actually, actually, there's some cool people out there right now.  I mean, we're under contract.  So it just has to be talks.  But I ain't fucking waiting around anymore.  Because a few of the listeners are right.  Instead of bitching, you got to do something about it.  Yeah.  They're absolutely right.  And that's exactly what I have begun doing.  He won't participate.  No.  No. 
[01:43:00]  No.  Because he knows he's going to look stupid.  Because he knows that it's not happening Sunday.  And it's not going to happen anytime soon.  How about we wait for football season to start?  Because that would be perfect.  There weren't any, I didn't have any follow-up questions.  Because, I mean, just asking a follow-up question would be disregarding the not participating thing.  Did I say he was leaving? 
[01:43:30]  Uh-uh.  No, I came back and he was gone.  I think Anthony had to take a watery shit.  He left pretty fast.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, this guy, Stephen and Charles, is right.  I like being the best kept secret after all these years.  I love it.  I think it's a good place to be.  I'm going to the crapper.  What, Ken?  Ken, he whispers into a microphone.  He's the best.  Anthony did say, I'm going to the crapper.  I know we heard when you whispered.  That's the best part of that.  And in fairness to Gary, he did apologize for not replying to my email that was mentioned yesterday. 
[01:44:00]  All right.  That's a good start.  I mean, he's a courteous guy.  He's a nice guy.  I'm not saying he's a rude guy.  He is a nice guy.  But why wasn't there a response?  I have no respect for him in this business, but he's a nice guy.  It's not about he's not a courteous man.  But why wasn't there a response?  It's like the work part wasn't done.  And I just don't understand.  Because I literally can't describe the absolute disgust I have. 
[01:44:30]  Because, again, I had something fall through.  It bugged me.  And I'm like, you know what?  I want to do this.  And all of a sudden, you put the wheels in motion and you get it done.  And it's so fucking simple.  It's just basic shit that should be done.  And we're not trying to reinvent anything here.  It's just basic promotional shit.  Oh, they're disgusting.  Just basic what they used to call housekeeping in the business.  You've got to continually housekeep. 
[01:45:00]  Be on top of things.  Try to figure out other ways to make the show better or other ways to promote the show.  That's why I came up with the podcast for iTunes.  To be in the podcast world, I think, is really important for Opie and Anthony.  According to the brand.  I've been saying for way more than a year that we should be on Sirius in some form.  Even if it's an hour of our old material.  But promoting the fact that we're on daily.  That would lead to people actually subscribing to our daily show. 
[01:45:30]  But we're in talks with that.  And then that finally happens.  But the guy who has the answers to that doesn't want to participate.  Whatever the fuck that means.  We absolutely should have a real visual element.  Because that leads to people subscribing.  We've got to stay on people a certain way, too.  I find that the reason my manager has been doing things better recently is because he knows that I'm a hair from firing him. 
[01:46:00]  And it's the first time I've ever really considered it in 10 years.  And people kind of sense that.  And that's how the agent, the radio agent, who I love.  I love a radio agent.  I love him.  Yeah, I like him as a guy.  But he should be fired.  Yeah, he absolutely should be.  And we should do it.  The funny thing is, I need a crown, you know, the tooth where a chunk of it just fell out eating hummus.  I've got to get a crown next week. 
[01:46:30]  So I wrote him a simple question.  Do I have dental?  I don't know if I do because there's been mergers and shit.  And he goes, I'll get back to you.  And it's been almost two weeks.  I never heard from him again.  Yeah.  Simple question.  Do I have dental insurance?  I don't even know.  Would you like me to follow up with him, GH?  Yeah, that'd be good.  Because I don't even like calling him anymore.  He knows that.  I don't call him anymore.  Because I know nothing.  He has nothing to say to me that's going to advance my career. 
[01:47:00]  I had something recently to go over with him.  And I stayed on it every day.  I called him.  Or every other day.  I'm like, what's going on with this?  Right.  And he got it, you know, the information.  Right.  But I hate having to pester a guy I'm paying.  Yeah, it had nothing to do with the little TV thing I'm doing for TBS.  He has nothing to do with that.  But I'm sure he'll take his cut because the check will go through him.  Oh, boy, do I fucking section them off on commissions.  I'm sure he'll fucking take his little taste.  Even though he had nothing to do with that.  I didn't go through him at all. 
[01:47:30]  Then you shouldn't commission him.  Yeah, I'm going to tell him.  Tell him not to touch my TBS money.  I can't wait to see that show, GH.  It's on in June.  Who gets the last laugh?  I didn't look like a fool.  That's all I cared about.  No, you look very good in that blue shirt.  Thank you, Kenny.  The promotional shot?  Yeah.  Oh, it's my Twitter.  Yeah.  That's why I changed my Twitter.  That was the TBS picture.  All right.  You were asking about these pants before? 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  Was I?  No, I just wanted to segue to the fact that I've lost a lot of weight.  I haven't been all the way.  My wife saw you walk in the streets yesterday.  Tell her that was just somebody I bumped into that had a wig on.  She said you were very preoccupied.  Where?  You were like across the street.  It wasn't a situation where she could easily say hi to you.  Was I?  In the neighborhood.  Oh, okay.  And she goes, man, he looks good.  Lost a lot of weight.  And she said you're dressing differently.  I bought a new jacket yesterday.  My fucking garbage bag old jacket. 
[01:48:30]  The only reason I can't throw it out is because I want to give it to a homeless guy.  It's warm.  I got a homeless guy for you.  Okay.  Our jacket?  Yeah.  It's done.  That's why I bought this.  You want to give a homeless guy a jacket as spring hits.  That's very charitable of you.  That's very nice.  I have a lot of pockets on my old jacket.  Yeah, I would walk in and they would just go, this motherfucker got pockets.  Can we do this razor thing now?  Sure.  Like right now?  Or do we have to do the...  You can do it now.  I'll do it now.  I actually... 
[01:49:00]  I'm actually a member of DollarShaveClub.com.  I need more razors, though.  How do I get that?  I can get them for you.  For real?  Sure.  Because I really like them.  Yeah.  It's one of the...  I'll put in a request.  There's only a couple of advertisers I actually like.  And DollarShaveClub.com is one of them.  It got started off on the wrong foot, but I brought it right back around.  And I really do like these guys a lot.  The whole thing now makes sense to me.  Your razor doesn't need a vibrating handle, a back scratcher, and 10 blades.  Seriously, have you noticed the price you pay for the new razor blades? 
[01:49:30]  It's outrageous.  I'm not doing the pesos line, Sam.  Sorry.  That's just not me.  And you're doing this every month?  Oh, then I can't read that line if I don't do the other thing.  Basically, what they're trying to tell the people out there is it's ridiculous how much razors cost.  This is your Dollar Shave Club moment.  And it's time to join all the Opie and Anthony listeners who've discovered DollarShaveClub.com.  Listen, here's what all the buzz is about.  It's like found money.  All this guy's want is a great shave without shilling out $20 month after month. 
[01:50:00]  Dollar Shave Club is genius.  You'd be crazy not to do this.  You send them a couple bucks a month, and they deliver amazing quality razor blades right to your front door.  You save a fortune, plus you always have fresh blades on hand.  And the razor they give you, like, it feels good in your hand.  It's heavy.  It's nice.  No more zombying your face with old blades because you can't afford it or you forget to buy new ones.  Join the rest of the Opie and Anthony listeners and get a great shave and keep your cash at DollarShaveClub.com. 
[01:50:30]  DollarShaveClub.com.  Go there right now.  DollarShaveClub.com.  The Opie and Anthony show.  We got Brandon Steiner coming in.  And there's a whole box of goodies.  I was going to say shit, but I mean in a good way.  Coming into the studio. 
[01:51:00]  Roller's carrying a box that looks really heavy with all sorts of memorabilia.  Don't talk about her like that.  Brandon!  Oh, look at that.  How you doing, sir?  Everybody good here?  What's going on, buddy?  Take a seat.  You had a great appearance last time, so we said, fuck, let's get Brandon back.  We'll up to the old microphone.  It was fun.  I got a lot of good feedback from that.  I want to thank you, first of all.  You guys are that popular.  Yeah, we're pretty popular.  Honestly, I don't even know if we're popular.  Somebody asked yesterday, they're like, do you know how many listeners do you have? 
[01:51:30]  Do they tell you?  They have never told us how many people listen to the show.  We have no fucking idea.  They know we'd get all full of ourselves.  I can't even give you a good guess.  The problem is, that's how I have my company.  My sales guys have no fucking idea.  That's the problem.  Yeah.  I want to thank you, first of all, for Dan Marino and the Derek Jeter.  Well, it's my pleasure.  The Jeter thing, well.  Signed baseball.  I was reading the paper today.  I'm hoping that he's going to sign a lot more baseballs this year for us. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, man.  It's always fun giving out those gifts, isn't it?  Yeah.  It's always fun.  It's a little more special than a sweater around Christmas.  And I brought gifts today.  I figured, you know, the people that are really, well, I was going to say, the people that are  out there listening, let's gift them.  Let's ethically bribe them.  That would be nice.  It's really good stuff that you brought as well.  You started with Derek Jeter.  The Yankees are going to have a horrible year, everyone's saying.  I like them.  I know it sounds crazy.  You like the Yankees.  I do like the Yankees.  No, I mean, obviously you like the Yankees, but do you like this team? 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I do.  I think it might be some trouble.  Yeah.  I mean, everybody is so used to such a high level, but I'd like to see the kids.  I want to see the kids come up.  But, you know, you've got to remember, we've still got some players.  I think Jeter will work out his, you know, we'll work it out.  His ankle, they said, what, was a little stiff yesterday?  A little stiff.  They're a little worried?  Still got CeCe.  Still got Cano.  We've still got some nice players.  What do you know?  What do you know?  That's if we can keep them.  That's if we can keep them, you know?  Yeah.  How about the tournament?  I mean, brackets, brackets, brackets. 
[01:53:00]  How about the high school, you know, the extended high school league, the NCAA?  Ah.  Basketball tournament.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, well, our own Sam Roberts was filling out his brackets over there on the corner.  Yeah, it's full of brackets.  Ah, that's a good one.  So happy to see Kentucky lose, I just want to say.  Kentucky's not even in the tournament.  So happy to see them lose last night.  It's great.  It's great, you know.  Oh, were they supposed to go all the way?  No.  No, they have a horrible team this year.  Oh, okay.  They didn't even make the tournament.  Goodbye.  So we're happy about that.  But then again, they lost all their players from last year. 
[01:53:30]  Ecstatic about that.  I'm mad all year round, so I just don't save it for just March.  March.  Very angry, man.  You should take a break in March.  He just stares at me.  I was trying to see which one of these pieces of memorabilia I could throw at you.  But Brandon wouldn't get too upset, right, that it's ruined?  I see Derek Jeter drink coaster set.  Yeah.  Well, you know what I brought is I was thinking while we're talking Yankees, I was sending  Brian Cashman a gift.  So I said to my guys, make me a map of all the different ballparks. 
[01:54:00]  Parachute.  Put a little dirt.  Yeah, you could have used a better parachute.  A little dirt next to each photo.  And it was cool because all the dirt's a little different from each ballpark.  But then I said, now you have a little dirt from every team in your office.  So I left one of those for you guys to have in your office.  That's really nice.  Oh, man.  That's really cool.  But we all know you're not taking the time to get dirt from every ballpark.  No, we really are.  And authenticated.  What do you go up in the Catskills and find a couple different dirts?  No, we really don't. 
[01:54:30]  We got the MLB authenticator.  He kind of sneaks onto the field, seals the pail, puts a hologram on the pail.  We can't open up the pail.  So the authenticator comes to our office hoping it's crazy.  Wow.  Dirt's gotten that important, huh?  Could be a dirt conspiracy.  You never know.  You don't want the right dirt.  The real dirt.  Stuff comes up phony.  It ruins you.  So it's smart.  It's smart.  Got to play by the rules.  Before we talk about what you brought in today, I do have a question.  We were looking at Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  That show splashes on ABC. 
[01:55:00]  And it got us wondering, some of these really famous older athletes did not make the money  like these guys are making today.  We learned that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar made $3 million at the end of his career.  He was making about $3 million a year, which is nice, obviously.  But you fast forward, he's 65 years old, and he's fallen off a diving board.  And it felt like there's a desperation there, like he might be a little desperate as far  as his finances go.  What happens to some of these guys? 
[01:55:30]  Well, you know, I always say this is what gets me crazy about the NCAA.  It's like these guys are in such a rush to leave college.  They can go play basketball and make a lot of money and then have no money afterwards  because they don't know how to manage their money.  They don't know how to be an adult.  And it kills me.  And I just see it more and more now.  And I'm getting a little older, 25 years at Steiner Sports, you just see so many guys  that don't have their money.  And they've made more than the Kareem, and they don't have the money.  They have no idea how to control it.  So you see a lot of players now, two things.  They're a little broke and then also they're a little bored because they haven't set themselves 
[01:56:00]  up to do something outside of playing basketball.  And it's not the, you know, a lot of these guys are not meant to coach or do that kind  of thing.  And you, I mean, and you do the autograph signings and stuff.  So you're helping out some of these old athletes.  You sign a little contract with them and they sign a bunch of things and they could get a  payday.  Have you been surprised by some of the athletes that have come your way going, wow, you don't  have any money left?  Yeah, I think sometimes I'm a little surprised that there are predicaments.  Remember, we do a lot of the corporate marketing, so we'll get them marketing stuff too. 
[01:56:30]  But what kills me is some of these guys that if they just would have given a little bit  of time and been authentic while they were hot, they would have an after career and they'd  have a good reputation and they'd have a little bit of a following.  And instead, they, you know, the microphones are in the locker room.  They think that'll carry them afterwards.  And I think they're a big mistake.  And it's really hard to go build your, you know, build up value and build up a perception  of being somebody other than just a basketball player once you're off the field.  And I think a lot of players don't put the time aside because they just think the money 
[01:57:00]  is going to keep rolling.  We were talking about Kareem before, and I love Abdul-Jabbar, but he didn't have a great  reputation of being, you know, Eddie Murray from the Orioles.  These guys were great, but don't have these, they just, they don't come off as very likable  guys.  So you love them as performers, but afterwards you have no interest in them because you didn't  have interest in them as a person while they were there.  Yeah, you didn't really have a personality, Kareem, all those years.  But Jeter, I mean, will work forever because everybody will want that charisma, that vibe  he has.  He'll always have something.  Even A-Rod will always have something. 
[01:57:30]  It's got to be weird for a lot of these guys to just retire in their late 30s, even though  they're big, huge superstars in their sport.  Like we signed Mariano for everything.  He's a friend and we've now done his marketing and all his licensing.  So I'm sitting with Mariano, I'm saying, are you sure?  This is about two months ago before he announced it.  He said, I have so many things I want to do.  I said, listen, it seems like that now because you're so busy, but when you get off that field,  there's no microphones, everything.  Let's, you know, let's plan some things now. 
[01:58:00]  What you want to do, it's like, we're going to do a baseball academy with him and we're  trying to, you know, he has this church that he's building, but it's, it's, it's hard  to get these guys to see what it's going to be like after baseball.  You should never build a church because you know your personal money is going to go into it  eventually.  Hopefully we're going to come up with enough money for the endowment.  By the way, he has made almost $300 million.  So, you know, you don't realize very quietly, uh, you know, he's done extremely well.  Uh, we've done very well with him off the field for the last 15 years and his, you know, 
[01:58:30]  his contracts have been extraordinary.  So he's, you know, I guess when you make that kind of money, you could probably build the  church and, you know, his wife is going to be the pastor.  It's beautiful.  It's a hundred year old church in New Rochelle.  And what's funny is like Mariano, you could hire somebody to hammer in the nails.  Like he's like the general contractor in this thing.  Oh, since you've been on last, uh, Kurt Schilling, my favorite.  Here's a guy that has literally no money left.  50 million.  He lost 50 million.  Cause he really believed in the, uh, the gaming world. 
[01:59:00]  Oh.  And, uh, he's selling his bloody sock the other day.  Yeah.  Bad things happen to bad people.  And, you know, he's a guy that, um, you know, and, you know, Kurt just is a guy who  just, I don't know.  He doesn't look well, by the way, gained a lot of weight.  I don't know if you saw me.  So he's got a lot of stress, but he was a guy that always stirred that shit up in the  locker room, always created little problems.  Didn't get along with the teammates.  So in 2004, one of the biggest years at Steiner sports, we have the most amazing year. 
[01:59:30]  You know, the Red Sox broke the curse.  So we have 5,000 items to get signed.  5,000 bats, jerseys.  So I, Kurt, we got to come over to your house to sign the stuff.  Is it okay if a couple of your teammates come over and sign at the same time?  Because otherwise we got to pack the stuff up, bring it to a hotel.  5,000.  5,000.  How long does it take to get 5,000?  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  How long does it take to get 5,000?  It's a couple days.  Sometimes it could be, it could be a six, seven hours, eight hours.  And you want these items signed by the entire team, I would assume.  Yeah. 
[02:00:00]  So we're doing the whole team.  Right.  And we're like, Kurt, these two guys, one of them was Damon.  I forget the other guy.  Can we do all three of you at the same time in your house?  It's your teammates.  He's like, no.  I don't want those guys in my house.  Like, seriously?  You just won the World Series together.  So we had to go bring a truck to his house.  And then as he's signing, we had to get a local hotel and then repackage.  That was like when I'm done with this guy.  This guy is...  What a dick.  Yeah.  And his autograph could have been a little nicer, too. 
[02:00:30]  But I'm just hoping he gets in the Hall of Fame and we'll get rid of the rest of his stuff  that we're saying with.  No one wants it.  That's what I talk about in the book.  It's like there's a chapter about how we turned around.  What I thought was my worst year when the Yankees, I mean, I was ready to jump off a bridge.  You know, I've got a lot of Yankees fans out there.  Kevin Brown, you know, was throwing meatballs down there.  Oh, he stinks.  Johnny Damon hit the Grand Slam.  I was like, I went for my third black and white cookie in four innings.  I mean, I don't know what to do.  I was out of my mind.  And then all of a sudden...  You eat black and white cookies?  I'm Brooklyn, baby.  Come on.  We invented the black and white cookie in Brooklyn. 
[02:01:00]  Out of all the cookies, you can eat, Brandon.  Well, I like a good Oreo, too.  But a black and white cookie, the original black and whites were invented.  And the seven-layer cake in Brooklyn.  Yeah.  Yeah.  By the way, do you know that that...  Are you talking about when the Yankees were up three-nothing and then lost four straight?  Yeah.  That is when my breathing problems started.  Do you know, like, I remember I was very sick when that happened.  Oh, it was terrible.  And I was laying on my back and I was trying to lay on my side.  And I kept...  My tongue kept choking me.  That was when the Yankees were up three-nothing.  Well, you were choking, too. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  I was.  I was like...  The hands came off my head and I...  No, that was when it started.  I remember that.  No kidding.  What year was that?  Was that 2005?  2004.  It was 2004.  It was right before we went back on the radio.  No, we were on.  We were on.  Oh, we were.  That's Kurt Schilling.  Yeah.  See how big he got?  He looks really old.  He looks like a comedian named Eddie Brill.  Wow.  He can't be more than 42-ish.  Really?  Yeah.  I think so.  That's about it.  43, maybe.  Yeah.  He should really be doing radio.  He's got a lot of opinions and stuff, though, that don't necessarily always make a lot 
[02:02:00]  of sense.  He used to be a really nice guy.  He's 46.  46.  Yeah.  I started my radio career, and he was pitching for the Rochester Red Wings.  We used to hang out.  Really?  More than a few times.  Yeah.  He was a really nice guy back then.  Wow.  I guess the pro career.  Arizona, Philly, Boston.  He had a great career.  Houston.  He had a great career.  I mean, you can't ask for a better career, especially coming to Boston.  Say you're going to beat the Yankees, which didn't happen. 
[02:02:30]  Right.  And then do it.  Yeah.  A lot of people don't know if that ... I mean, I still think there's a conspiracy about  that whole bloody sock thing.  Was he that hurt?  Nah.  Kind of question.  Nah, he probably just picked a scab.  I don't know.  Shit happens.  Pick the scab.  Shake.  Rally the troops.  Well, you pick one of those scabs where the blood just ... It doesn't stop anytime soon.  And you go, ah, fuck it.  I got to go out there and pitch anyway.  You want to give some shit away, Brandon?  Let's give some stuff away.  What do you got?  Can I thank you, by the way?  You sent me some nice cases and stuff, which I'm going to use for my basketballs. 
[02:03:00]  But the boxing stuff is not on the website anymore.  Are you out of the boxing things?  What was ... I heard you were saying that before.  It was the UV-protected boxing glove things.  But I was going to buy them.  I can't even find them on the website.  They should be on there.  My web guy, I don't know.  I think he wakes up and he hits his head against a wall sometimes and he forgets shit.  They were not on there.  I was looking.  You go to steinersports.com.  If you go there, it's like ... Even I go to the center.  I'm like, where is some of this shit?  Let me see.  Well, there is 29,000 SKUs.  I mean, I can't hold my accountable for everything, but ... 
[02:03:30]  You're right.  When you click on boxing cases, it says no brothers.  It's bullshit, though.  This is stuff that gets me ... I get in the office.  This is why I get crazy.  I told Roland I want to take a tour of the operation.  Oh, you got to come up.  I want to check it out.  Where are you?  Right off of 95 and Newer Shell.  It's about 25, 30 minutes.  I would love to check out the operation.  It's a 50,000-square-foot operation.  Wow.  About 100 employees.  All right, we're going to set that up.  I'd like to back up a truck to the front.  You got to bring your kids.  You got to bring the kids.  Well, the kids are still a little too young.  Almost three in about five, six months. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That is a little bit young.  I mean, you got your hands full, dude.  But I got some nephews I'll bring up there.  Bring them.  12- and 13-year-olds.  Bring them.  And also, we have our athlete days.  We had Jeter up there for a whole day a couple weeks ago.  Could you get my picture signed?  I have a picture with Jeter.  I want to get signed.  Yeah, send it to me.  Send it to me.  Of course.  But we have some good athletes coming up.  It's a pretty good thing.  You see it on the website, all the upcoming signings and who's coming up to New Rochelle.  There's like these VIP tours and all this stuff on steinersports.com. 
[02:04:30]  You got competition?  Not really.  Not as an overall, but there's some other people.  A lot of little micros.  You know, a guy that's in this town, that town.  But not an overall brand that does like a Notre Dame Steiner or a Peyton Manning Steiner.  And you only do sports?  We're trying to get at some music.  I'm working on some stuff now with some music.  I think you should.  That was going to be my next question.  I know you think I'm crazy, but I sit next to Jay Z at Yankee Games.  You know, we've shared seats for years. 
[02:05:00]  So at one point.  Wait, do you know each other?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You guys talk and stuff?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we wrap out now.  But here's the thing.  So I'm eating some Twizzlers one day, and he's sitting next to me.  And I really didn't know who he was.  And I knew he was a rapper, but I'm like, I don't know.  I'm like some 50-year-old Jewish guy.  What do I know from the rap?  So he grabs one of my Twizzlers and starts eating it.  I said, Jay, we're not boys.  He says, well, you've got to come to one of my concerts.  I said, Jay, I need to hang with you for a whole day.  Calls me up.  I go hang with him.  The whole thing. 
[02:05:30]  He's DJing behind there.  To get some bitches?  Who's very low-key.  Just the four of us.  Man, you should have got some bitches.  I got my pick bitches.  I have 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one.  Oh, shit.  You know what I'm saying?  Are you jealous?  Yeah.  But I'm feeling the J.  I mean, I've got to tell you something.  Wait, wait, wait.  Slow down.  Slow down.  Slow down.  You've got to explain a day with Jay-Z.  So I go to Yankee Stadium.  Right.  There's a person waiting for me there.  He goes, here's the green room.  Here's where all the VIPs are.  I go, great.  This is going to be great.  He goes, no, no.  That's not where you're hanging. 
[02:06:00]  You're going to Jay's room.  So there's a room, maybe it's 1,000 square feet.  Unbelievable DJ system.  Phenomenal.  And the TV.  So Jay comes in about 7 o'clock.  He's not going on until 10.  I'm like, what am I going to talk to him about for three hours?  So we're hanging out, and we're watching the Yankee game, which is a lot of fun.  He's very, very sports knowledgeable.  So we're hanging out, watching the Yankee game.  It was me, him, his boy Juan from 4040, and another guy.  It's four of us.  And then P. Diddy walks in. 
[02:06:30]  Little Wayne walks in.  P. Diddy?  Oh, P. Puff Daddy.  Oh, Wayne.  So I watched.  Do you have any zzzer?  I watched the concert with P. Diddy, which was kind of cool.  And then it was kind of cool.  We're just kidding.  I'm just trying to get in the whole deal.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What's going on?  What did you talk to them about?  We're talking to the Yankees.  We're also talking about rap.  And, like, he was very hyped up about the Yankee Stadium concerts.  I'm sure he's going to be hyped up this summer about them.  There's just something about being in his hometown and knocking and just the diversity of the crowd. 
[02:07:00]  You should write a song about his hometown.  You know.  Should do that.  Brooklyn.  Easy on the Brooklyn.  Oh, man.  So, you know, I have that Brooklyn connection with him.  What I loved about Jay was how serious he is about relevance.  You know, how he wants to get.  There was, like, a lot of older people.  A lot of white people.  A lot of every kind of people.  Whoa.  In that stadium.  And I think he's just proud of that.  He wants hip-hopping around the stairs.  Well, the cops have to be there.  Yeah.  But I'll tell you, it was pretty cool.  So I've been getting into his lyrics. 
[02:07:30]  I've been getting into a lot of his products.  Whoa.  Just looking at his songs and seeing how I could create a product line with that.  And do Jay-Z sign-up.  And what would you sell, like, for musicians that's different than what they typically sell?  Because that's what you do at sports is sell stuff that's different.  And you go on the site.  It's like the stuff that they're displaying is all different and weird.  And, like, wow, I wouldn't have thought to put that with that.  Like, that's what's great about it.  Well, I like the song lists.  I like the handwritten lyrics.  I like the actual stuff that they wear.  I'd like to auction some of those funky things he's wearing.  People love to have that stuff. 
[02:08:00]  I mean, you look at a guy that popular.  He had some great, great photos from some different acts when he's doing something, like, with a Beyonce.  Or he's doing something with Eminem.  That would be a cool photo to have if you were at that concert.  I like the concert poster.  And just replicating that and being able to have that.  If you were at that concert.  Like, I went to see Jay at Carnegie Hall.  I was the guy in the front row.  You know, it was very weird.  One guy?  Carnegie Hall, black tie.  But, you know, that's a cool concert, Jay-Z at Carnegie Hall.  That would be wild.  I have an idea to talk to Brandon about. 
[02:08:30]  Now we've got a money-making session going on here.  Oh, shit.  Off the air.  I like it.  For O&A?  No.  Damn it!  For charity.  You're going to make Sirius Radio some money here while we're here.  Oof.  You've got a good idea.  We're not company men, trust me.  I do.  Good luck to those people.  That poor guy outside of me.  I was going to ask him to come in with me, but I guess that wouldn't be a good idea.  Who?  The guy that won't participate.  I mean, some coaching lessons, right?  I can work it out for that kid. 
[02:09:00]  So we're going to give some stuff away.  Yeah.  But anyway, Jay-Z, though, we do have a couple of Jay-Z signed stuff on our website.  You do?  Yeah, we do.  We did a couple of signings with him, but I really want to put a product line together  with him.  I think he's fun.  I'd love something signed by Jay-Z.  Like, I try to keep putting him on Sam and won't listen to it, but I'm like, guys, it's  fun.  Yeah, Sam's really not into Jay-Z.  We're lying to you, surprisingly.  They're not telling the truth.  You want to do, like, trivia or something?  Make it fun?  Yeah, we've got to do something.  You've got any good sports questions?  Yeah, I think so. 
[02:09:30]  You do?  Oh, man.  Sure.  Can't just give it away.  Brandon's book, by the way, is called You Gotta Have Balls, and we plugged it the last  time he was on, but it's really, really good, and it's informative, and you're like a self-made  guy, man.  It's very interesting.  Well, thank you.  This book's done unbelievably well, so very blessed.  I read it.  Oh, did you?  No.  Oh, okay.  Well, you read the first 40 pages, you know, about my poor childhood and everything else.  We won't go back in time, but...  You remember that.  But the book's doing well.  They're doing some speaking around the country. 
[02:10:00]  It's doing very well, and people should read...  I have two kids.  That's why I'm not reading right now.  That's okay.  I'm going to start reading again.  The book's on tape.  Oh, really?  I just need to get in the car.  Just get in the car.  Signed up by Barry Larkin.  I heard.  I'm going to have something for the Midwest audience in this show.  Who signed your book?  Barry Larkin.  How great.  That's Hall of Famer.  That's pretty cool.  So I'm just going to sign it as well, and we'll send it out to a listener.  So how about we just take phone calls, and we maybe get some questions?  Yeah.  Let's do it.  Just to make it kind of interesting for everybody.  I'm going to start from the top there.  Strawberries for Jim.  You got a question, Brandon, for a trivia question? 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  I don't want people looking this shit up.  How about there?  Yeah, that's true.  We got to be careful.  People Google that up like, bam.  But if they Google, how about we put two guys on the line?  Here's two guys.  And then the first person answer it.  Yeah.  So if they're Googling, then you got to be good at Googling.  All right.  That's fair.  We got Barry in New Jersey, who's trying to win something from Brandon Steiner.  And we got Joker from L.A.  What's up, guys? 
[02:11:00]  Opie, I'm driving.  This is Barry.  I'm driving, so I can't Google anything.  All right.  Good luck to you, because Brandon's got a question.  And whoever comes up with the answer first, Barry or Joker, is going to win what?  Well, you know what we'll do?  You got Ball's book, signed by Barry Larkin.  Wow.  Okay.  Who won the Super Bowl in 1985?  And who was the MVP?  Oh, my God.  I know that one.  Cincinnati Bengals.  Even I know that.  Yeah, Cincinnati Bengals.  No, it wasn't.  They lost.  It was San Francisco, Joe Montana.  Nope. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, you dummies.  You're both wrong.  Dallas Cowboys.  I don't care.  Oh, my God.  No.  Well, football fans wouldn't be...  It's not a strength of the show.  I get that.  Jumping through hoops.  I guess they blew it.  They can't answer that.  They both blew it.  Yeah, I got to score.  And you have to change questions.  I don't even answer the Bears.  Yeah, the Bears.  Oh, the Bears.  And Peyton Manning.  Yep.  No, there's no Peyton Manning.  Was it Walter Peyton?  It was Walter Peyton.  No.  Well, you know, the whole thing with Walter, they didn't let him score the touchdown. 
[02:12:00]  The defense.  It was the Fridge.  The Bears defense won.  It was the Fridge.  Fridge who scored that big touchdown.  Now, instead of Peyton, you should give him the ball.  Who was the MVP?  Was it the refrigerator or was it Dent?  It was the entire defense.  It was Dent.  It was Dent?  Yeah, it was Dent.  Oh, wow.  Bucky?  No.  It's Harvey.  Harvey.  Harvey.  All right, you want to try this?  Let's go to Nick in Minnesota.  What's up, Nick?  Nick-y.  Hey, what's going on?  It's Rick, but who cares?  All right, Rick. 
[02:12:30]  I'm sorry about that.  Rick in Minnesota.  We got Bob in New York.  What's up, Bob?  What's up, guys?  What's Derek Jeter's middle name?  Sanderson.  All right, we got a winner.  Wow.  All right, bullshit.  He Googled it.  Wait, who said that?  Bob.  All right, Bob in New York.  Sorry, Rick in Minnesota.  Rick in Minnesota.  He's trying to cheat.  All right, Bob, you got a signed book by Barry Larkin.  Hold on in line, all right?  Is someone going to take this call there, E-Rock?  Better. 
[02:13:00]  All right, you got it.  Okay.  You want to do another one there?  Yeah, we'll do another one.  We have Peyton Manning.  Oh.  Love Peyton.  A signed Broncos mini helmet.  Just kind of a nice little gift.  It's a great gift.  A small little player.  It's a nice little season, huh?  He had a nice little comeback.  I mean, I like him.  He's the real deal.  His family's the real deal.  Yeah.  So here's the...  We have a listener.  Sure.  Hold on there, Brandon.  Let me go to Wade in South Carolina.  Wade.  I like the phones that lit up here.  I like that.  This show is hot.  This show is hot.  I got to...  You guys are a little insecure about your listening base? 
[02:13:30]  Not at all.  Yeah.  Those are all calls coming in the back office.  I just want to reassure you.  I just want to reconfirm me.  You got a lot of people listening to this show.  It's amazing.  It's my mini helmet, Wade.  Wade in South Carolina.  So Peyton Manning...  Hold on, hold on.  And we got Oscar in Boston.  Oscar, say hi.  Hey, what's going on, boy?  All right.  Listen to Brandon Steiner.  Oscar, all kidding.  Are you from Brooklyn?  No, I'm from Boston.  All right.  All right.  Hey, how about this?  Let's remember.  Bucky Dutt in that home run.  Fucking Aaron Bull in that home run. 
[02:14:00]  And the whole phone was the best thing I've ever heard in my life.  The best thing I've ever saw in my life.  Yeah, it was pretty good.  Well, here's a question for you.  That was pretty good.  You're right.  But 2004 was pretty good for the Red Sox, too.  I can't say the Bucky Dent homer was just pretty good, Brandon.  That's not fair.  That was an amazing fucking home run.  Hey, I'm Brandon.  2003, that was the worst thing.  I was crying.  Yeah, I hear you.  Me, too.  Try to be off at Wakefield.  Here's the question for you, though, if you want to win the Peyton Manning helmet.  If we can move off the Yankee thing for a second. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  Eli Manning, his brother.  Yep.  Right.  His dad's name.  And what team did he play for?  Oh, that's easy.  He's Archie Manning, and he played for the Saints.  Correct, Amanda.  All right.  We got a winner.  If you want another one, he went to Ole Miss, too, in college.  Tidebreaker.  Tidebreaker.  But where did Peyton go to college?  Yeah, there was some.  Where did Peyton go to college?  Where did Peyton go to college?  He went to University of Tennessee Volunteers.  All right.  That's good.  Jesus.  I'm just hearing, like, there's a tie. 
[02:15:00]  We only got to do one guy at a time.  You can't do two.  There's kind of a tie there.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We have to have a tiebreaker.  All right.  We have to have a tiebreaker.  Hold on, and it's got to be the first person.  Yeah.  Okay.  Ready for the tiebreaker?  We all agree that was a tie because the lawyers would get involved with us to be contesting.  All right.  Brandon has the tiebreaker.  Okay.  The tiebreaker is, in 1969, who was the defensive end for the Baltimore Colts when they played  the Jets and lost? 
[02:15:30]  Google.  I don't know it.  I don't know it.  I'm not Googling anything.  He won a Super Bowl for the Oakland Raiders.  Oakland Raiders?  And he was in a bunch of movies.  Oh.  Was it Deacon?  Deacon Jones?  Absolutely not.  Nope.  I think I know it.  You might have to go on another question on that one.  Wow.  You got a lifeline there?  A friend?  No? 
[02:16:00]  I don't have a lifeline.  No.  I'm next to my sister.  I don't think she's going to know any football questions.  Yo.  Was it Bubba Smith?  Bubba Smith.  Oh, wow.  I wouldn't have known.  It was Bubba.  Bubba Smith.  Police Academy.  I mean, rest his soul.  All right.  Another tiebreaker.  Okay.  This is for the Peyton Manning signed helmet.  Ray Rice, who just won the Super Bowl right now, what high school did Ray Rice go to that  recently they had this crazy shot with only like a second left on the buzzer to beat Mount  Vernon? 
[02:16:30]  What high school did he play at?  What high school?  I forgot the name.  It's in New Jersey.  It's, I think it's Scarlet Knights, something like that.  Well, you need the name.  That's the question.  Yeah, the question is the name.  I don't know.  I don't know what high school.  It's not Jersey.  We can tell you this much.  It's not Jersey.  Say something.  Oh, New York.  It was in New York.  My bad.  It was in...  It's a city that's been mentioned on the show before.  Oh, boy.  By me.  Barely mentioned.  Here and there.  Here and there it's mentioned.  Westchester? 
[02:17:00]  Yes.  West city in Westchester.  I don't know.  I don't know the city of the Westchester.  Come on.  You got to pay attention.  Jeez.  All right.  Another tiebreaker.  Holy shit.  It's New Rochelle, you bastards.  New Rochelle.  Jeez.  That wasn't amazing.  The Ugunauts.  The Ugunauts.  That was amazing.  That's where you got to play the game.  New Rochelle.  New Rochelle.  New Rochelle.  New Rochelle.  That was the best.  What high school did he go to?  I can't remember the name of the school, but...  But, uh, yeah.  He's still working at Cup lessons.  All right, guys.  You're still in it. 
[02:17:30]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Wade in South Carolina, Oscar Boston.  You're still in it.  Here's another tiebreaker question coming at you.  One more here.  Who, the Super Bowl and Super Bowl 21, right?  Yep.  Who won the MVP in Super Bowl 21?  21.  Hmm.  Now, I'll give you a little hint here.  The Giants will play in the Broncos.  Oh.  Oh, um...  Damn, what's his name?  What's that?  Giants play in the Broncos. 
[02:18:00]  Oh.  It was Phil Simms.  Oh, there it is.  There you go.  All right.  Good one.  All right.  Who said that?  Tom said it.  You!  You!  Wait.  Who said it?  Who said it?  Oscar.  I made it.  Get one out from Boston.  All right.  Here's Oscar.  All right.  Thanks, Wade.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Oscar, hold on a line.  You got a signed little football helmet by Peyton Manning.  It's pretty cool.  Watch out.  I got a Dan Marino version of that, and it's really nice.  One more just play. 
[02:18:30]  All right.  Hold on, Oscar.  All right.  Oscar got that.  What do you got?  We got one more.  We got Derek Jeter standing on the NY, hand signed by Derek.  Beautiful framed photo.  Can I see it?  Yeah.  Very nice.  Wow.  That is nice.  Can I?  Oh, baby.  You don't want to do that.  Even I have to say that.  Oh.  There you go.  That's nice.  I like that.  I like that.  That's a very nice shot.  We can hold on to this, and then we just give away the dirt map one. 
[02:19:00]  Let's give away the dirt map one.  We have the dirt from every team.  We can just tease the Derek Jeter.  People would want it.  All right.  Let's do the Derek Jeter.  People are going to want the Jeter.  Oh, yeah.  You tease the Derek Jeter, man.  He's at the end of his career.  That's a big item right here.  Hold on.  Big item.  Who knows?  He's at the end of the career.  He's got plenty of career left.  Everybody's thrown.  How old is he?  Does it matter?  24.  I was 24.  It doesn't matter.  We've got plenty of time left.  These guys are now going the distance, playing a 40, 50 years old.  Crazy.  It's crazy.  By the way, Brandon's coming up with all these questions.  I know. 
[02:19:30]  We don't know if he's wrong, by the way.  Yeah, I know.  I don't know if the listeners know if we're wrong or not.  I have a good trivia question.  We're going to go to Flint, Michigan.  For Brandon.  You do?  Yes.  Go ahead.  Who dropped the pass in the end zone in Super Bowl XIII?  Oh, God.  Is it Jackie Smith?  Fuck.  Jesus.  Poor guy.  Damn.  Poor guy.  You would have won a handful of blueberries.  That's pretty good.  You know this shit.  Very healthy.  Let's say hi to John in Flint, Michigan.  John.  Hello, gentlemen.  And, well, you're going to go against Nick in Niagara Falls. 
[02:20:00]  Got listeners all over the country there, Brandon Steiner.  Hey, we need Niagara to win.  We need Niagara to win.  We need them to beat Maryland.  We need Niagara to beat Maryland.  We need that to happen.  NIT, baby.  Really?  So here's my question.  Barry Bonds.  Baseball.  I know.  What team?  I'd say the depth, the intelligence depth of the listeners of this show, phenomenal.  He's jumping.  He's jumping.  Trying to get ahead of the curve there. 
[02:20:30]  Baseball.  This shit is deep.  We're really at some deep thought here this morning.  Believe me, that's probably not the first thought that came to his head.  Barry Bonds.  What team did he play for prior to playing for the Giants?  Oh, first guy said it.  All right.  Who was the first guy to say it?  John from Flinttown.  Was John first?  Yes, sir.  All right.  Thanks, Nick.  Hey, sorry.  The guy from Niagara.  The guy from Niagara.  He's out.  Oh, he's gone?  Yeah, we don't fuck around. 
[02:21:00]  He's out.  Damn, we cut him out like a New York.  But we got John in Flint, Michigan.  He's got the side Derek Jeter picture.  It's a really nice picture, John.  All right.  Hold on a line, brother.  Hold on a line, John.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you.  We got some enthusiasm.  Let's go.  He's psyched.  It's about time we get a thank you.  It's about time he had a good prize.  We've only been at this almost 19 years.  We finally get a thank you.  Where's the guy that we want to participate?  We need him in here to thank us.  Oh, God.  He can thank us.  That tool.  Are you done or do you want to keep going?  Let's keep going. 
[02:21:30]  We have another cool item.  Well, you know, we have the map, the dirt map.  We have this map.  Let me see the dirt map.  The old dirt map.  I'm not too sure about the dirt map.  I got to be honest.  No, the dirt map is great.  Have you got a nice big room downstairs?  Oh, that is nice.  Oh, that is fucking cool.  Got your certificate of authenticity.  I love this.  Now, the dirt is authenticated.  Each capsule is just 28 freaking.  I mean, everything's authenticated independently.  Was that a pain in the ass to put together?  Yes.  A complete pain in the ass.  I mean, because, you know, we don't screw around with the dirt.  How many you got?  Hold that up there, young Sam. 
[02:22:00]  Every team does dirt pull from each stadium.  Do you feel authenticated by an independent authenticator?  That's what we do with MLB to make sure our shit is real.  That's really cool.  I do have a question for you.  Do you feel sorry for the old school sports guys that ran on the field when you used to  be able to run on the field and they would get their cup of dirt?  And they can't prove it to anyone nowadays?  I do feel bad for the best.  That's why I'm here.  Cup of dirt from the Mets World Series or whatever it would have been?  I do feel bad for it.  Yes, I do.  Because some cool stuff that people used to grab.  In those days, you used to be able to run on the field. 
[02:22:30]  Now they don't like it.  I told you a story of when I was living in Buffalo with the Bills.  They won the AFC Championship and they ripped the goal post down and I watched them carry  it to the top of the stadium.  This is a God's honest truth.  I have people that will back me up and they threw it over the top and then on the other  side, everyone grabbed hold of this thing and started walking down the road with it and  pieces were being broken off as they kept walking.  And it was a matter of who could hold on the longest would get this damn thing.  Those are the days when the goal post was wood. 
[02:23:00]  Was it wooden or?  No, this was about early 90s, I guess.  And to this day, they're in all the sports bars around the stadium, pieces of that goal post.  But I was at that game.  What, did they have a hacksaw or something?  I don't know because by the end of it, the thing was still in pretty big pieces, but it  was starting to get broken apart a bit.  I think from the sheer amount of people that were carrying this and pulling it different  directions and stuff.  But I watched them.  They said, well, how the fuck do we get this out of here?  And they decided to fucking move it to the top and drop it over the side. 
[02:23:30]  I love that.  We get the goal post from Texas Stadium.  We chopped that up.  I want to get the one from Notre Dame.  So you can get the goal post from the Meadowlands when we moved that stadium across the street.  We chopped that up.  That's on Steiner Sports.  You can get that.  I got a sports question.  Tao, what do you think of him?  Strange bird, huh?  Yeah, it's strange.  You know, I think he's going to end up, I think he'll end up being a good player and  everything.  But it's just strange, all that shit that happened.  And it's unusual because Notre Dame, I think, and all the teams I deal with at Steiner, 
[02:24:00]  it's the most buttoned up group of people I get to work with.  They're phenomenal.  So this is very odd for them.  Usually their players are extremely buttoned up, straight and narrow.  But, you know, it's their kids.  And, you know, kids do.  Do you believe him?  You think he fell for this whole thing?  I don't know.  I'm not sure.  I can't tell.  I think the pay-per-view would be the lie detector test.  Right.  I'm not sure anymore, either.  At first, I'm like, this guy's full of shit, but he just seems like a real strange kid.  I think he's just a little bit of a strange kid, cat. 
[02:24:30]  And, you know, and...  And they're saying his skills aren't up to par for the NFL.  Well, I mean, it's so hard to tell on paper.  I'll show you 100 guys where, you know, these numbers are...  Huh?  He's got the bad cholesterol, you mean?  But, I mean, I think you can never tell.  I mean, with these numbers, you know, on the field, we've seen a lot of players not show up well on those numbers and become stars.  Got any Penn State stuff you can't get rid of?  It's a little too controversial.  No, Turner would never sign for us.  We tried, we tried, we tried.  And not the most loved guy, by the way. 
[02:25:00]  No, huh?  By who?  By his peers.  Because he always thought he was bigger and better than everyone, I felt.  But I tell you what's interesting is if Pennsylvania, who's suing the NCAA, which a lot of people are rooting for,  for that to happen, you know, is it fair that they take 112 wins away from the kids that had nothing to do with this?  Like, I mean, you know, they, yeah, but those kids know they won those games.  Yeah, I guess.  But, you know, they just overdid it, though.  I just feel like the NCAA overdid it. 
[02:25:30]  Kind of Gestapo-like.  I disagree.  I think that they were harsh and they should have been harsh only because it was, it was kids' sex.  It was such an ugly, and the university behaved so reprehensibly.  I feel bad for the students, but the college itself behaved just repugnantly.  Is that a word?  It's a word.  I agree.  Be hard on the school, but I don't want to punish the other kids that have nothing to do with it.  Be hard on the school, rightfully so.  Yeah.  But that's a mess. 
[02:26:00]  There's a lot of tension right now in collegiate sports with the NCAA with all the rules.  I mean, you know all the rules?  Like, I can't follow all the rules, but I know everybody's on probation.  What kind of rules?  Just, you can't do this, you can't do that.  You know, I was having lunch with a basketball player for Division I, top kid, senior, probably going to go pro.  At the end of lunch, he's asking me if I have any yard work to do in my house.  These kids have no money.  You can't give them a quarter.  And the amount of money they're making for these universities, and a lot of these guys will never see the big paydays. 
[02:26:30]  There's a big law, there's a Supreme Court level, Ed O'Bannon, you know, all the licensing.  See, apparently when these kids sign their rights away, they're minors.  So he's gone up to the Supreme Court level, and there's a lot of people who feel that the players are going to win,  which is that some big checks are going to have to get written by all these companies that have used the likeness of all these college players.  Oh, boy.  Now, it would be hard to go split that up between all the participants, but there's a feeling that that may change in the next couple of years,  where college players, if you use their likeness for jerseys, trading cards, video games, you're going to have to pay them. 
[02:27:00]  I think that's a good thing.  You should absolutely have to.  You know, they're amazing college athletes, but a lot of them never make it on the pro level.  I just want to warm up our audience there before, you know, everybody locks into a remote control and watches TV for the next five days.  Oh, man.  Well, do you have anything for North Carolina State?  30-year anniversary of the big Valvano thing.  Yeah, you know, I was with Coach Knight the other night.  We did an event at Steiner, and we were talking about Coach V, and, you know, it's interesting, the 30-for-30 on ESPN2. 
[02:27:30]  I just watched it.  That's why I'm bringing it up.  It was amazing.  But did you see how they killed him at the end, though?  You know, with the cheating.  Yeah, spoiler.  Yeah, they killed him at the end.  He died of cancer, but what he's saying is, like, they show this amazing guy,  and then the last, like, he's absolutely right, the last six, seven minutes, they killed him  because he was brought up on all sorts of violations.  Jimmy Valvano.  Jimmy V.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah, you are absolutely right.  You know, I just felt bad that that's how they ended it, but what a great salesman. 
[02:28:00]  What a great hypester.  You know, and I always tell a lot of my friends that do coach, it's like, you've got to coach less  and sell more these days, and that's what Jimmy V did, and he sold it in.  He got the team to win.  That was pretty cool how they beat Houston.  I mean, that fucking coach from Houston, if I'm in Houston, I think they should ban  that guy from walking into the state.  You have Drexler, Hakeem Olajuwon, you don't win the championship?  It was unbelievable.  How do you lose to the guy out of the state?  That was the biggest upset, maybe, of all time.  High slammer or jammer or whatever. 
[02:28:30]  That's the biggest upset of all time.  Houston was so much better than NC State that year, and NC State pulled it off.  That's why that whole year is amazing for Jimmy V.  Yeah, you have Drexler and Olajuwon.  Amazing.  But you go back in these tournaments.  And then you have the coach who's eating his tablecloth.  It's too inside.  He used to chew on a fucking tablecloth.  Meanwhile, the guy throws up an air ball.  That seems to make it worse.  At the end of the game, the guy throws an air ball up, and they end up winning. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  On an air ball.  At least the guy catches it and dunks it in.  And dunks it in for the win.  I've got to sign Babe Ruth's iPad.  What can I get for that?  Hey, you know Mike Francesa?  Yeah.  I mean, I follow him a little bit.  We got him on the line here.  Francesa, say hi to Brandon Steiner.  Brandon, Mike Francesa.  How are you?  How are you doing?  Brandon, as my audience knows, I never was into autographs.  I had to get silly. 
[02:29:30]  I had a million autographs.  I had more autographs than you.  But I was thinking about something for my kids, when I'm not around anymore.  So when I pass, I was thinking about cutting up sections in my stomach.  I know what it is.  Maybe an auction more.  You want to talk about career longevity in New York.  I'm here longer than G.  I'm here longer than L.T.  I'm here longer than Willow 3.  I'm here longer than you.  If you call the fan, you'll let me know, Brandon.  See you guys later.  Bye-bye. 
[02:30:00]  What's Mike's birthday today?  Is it really?  It's Mike's birthday today, yeah.  That is so funny.  That's funny.  Oh, man.  Okay.  It's Mike's birthday today.  All right, are we giving away the dirt?  We've got to give away the dirt.  Now we've got this map.  It has every Major League Baseball team on there.  Okay.  And it's got a little capsule of dirt authenticated.  It's a very large piece.  We're going to ship it to you.  Let's go to Baltimore.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Baltimore.  Hey, Jeff.  Hey, Jeff.  You on the wire or something? 
[02:30:30]  Yes, I am.  What do you want to say?  Hey, Jeff.  What do you want to take on?  North Carolina or PA?  I'll take on the North Carolina redneck.  All right.  We've got Dan in North Carolina.  Dan, you're taking on Jeff in Baltimore.  I'm actually from Buffalo originally, so I'm not really a redneck.  All right.  Oh, wow.  You got out of Buffalo.  Congratulations.  Look where you went.  North Carolina's cool.  I do remember that game, Opie.  I remember watching that thing on TV when the fans were caught up the field, too. 
[02:31:00]  It was unbelievable.  They just don't allow that to happen anymore, obviously.  I used to love when you were able to run out on the field.  That's the coolest thing, man.  They tried to field both down, cut up the field.  They had to prepare it for the AFC championship game versus the Raiders.  Oh, so the game I'm talking about wasn't the AFC championship game?  No.  No, it was the AFC East.  They won the AFC East championship.  That was the East.  Okay.  All right.  It's so long ago.  I apologize.  I thought it was the actual championship game. 
[02:31:30]  Do you guys remember when Wade Boggs was on that horse backwards?  The old days when you could fucking go out there and party with everybody.  That was 96.  He got in trouble for that, though.  Did he really?  Yeah, he did.  He got fined for that.  Oh, yeah.  Why?  Did he get on a horse?  I think he allowed to get on police horses.  All right.  Gee.  Was it Major League Baseball to find him?  I don't remember.  Or the state of New York?  We have to Google that up.  We have to Google that up.  Something happened, yeah.  We love Wade.  Wade's a good guy.  All right.  We're giving away dirt, guys.  It's Jeff in Baltimore and Dan in North Carolina. 
[02:32:00]  Ditching the dirt.  Yeah.  Listen to Brandon Steiner.  He's got a trivia question.  I need you to name five, well, five.  Five, three thousand hit members.  I'll make it easy.  Five, three thousand hit members.  He's in the three thousand hit club.  Rod Carew.  Wade Boggs.  Derek Keeter.  Derek Keeter.  Jack up.  Pete Rowe.  Rod Carew.  They're just doing it together.  That's a bad question. 
[02:32:30]  We'll give you a better question.  Strap that question.  And Paul Molitor.  Same five.  You also forgot.  Did anyone say fucking Tony Gwynn?  Tony Gwynn.  Thank you.  Good job.  Well done.  Hold on.  That's a bad question.  Yeah.  We need a question.  One quick answer.  Let's scrap that question.  Let's scrap that question.  Let's move to another football question. 
[02:33:00]  In 1999, who was in the Super Bowl?  Who won the MVP?  99.  Rams and Kurt Warner.  Yeah.  Who said that? 
[02:33:30]  Jeff Lowe.  Just liars.  Liars.  I love it.  Fucking liars.  They're always doing that.  Who said it?  Fucking assholes.  Who said it?  Jeff from Baltimore.  I think it was Jeff.  That's my guy.  Yeah.  He said Kurt Warner.  I think it was Jeff from Baltimore.  Dan, I'm sorry.  I think you're lying.  Yeah, Dan.  You're full of luck.  You're a liar.  Full of turkey.  Can we give him something for lying?  Because that's a good lie.  That's a good lie.  Dan, job here. 
[02:34:00]  Hold on, Dan.  We're giving you something for...  Dan.  Thank you very much.  Dan, hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Dan, we're giving you something.  We're going to give you a lightning round here, Dan.  You ready?  You ready?  I'm ready.  Okay.  Tell me who won the World Series last year, and who was the MVP?  I don't even give a shit who won last year.  It wasn't the Yankees.  Oh.  Oh.  I like that.  I like your loyalty.  She turned off the TV.  It was pretty exciting, though. 
[02:34:30]  It was the Tigers and Miguel Cabrera.  That's wrong.  But they were in the World Series, though, so I'll give you half a credit for that.  I don't know the answer to that.  What is the answer to that?  The, uh, Drew Winger.  Hey, here's a better one.  No, we're done with these.  Yeah, we're done.  We're done with you.  Next.  Hold on.  Do you want to give Dan something for me?  Yeah, we're going to give you some Yankee coasters.  All right.  Because he could put your dirty martini on.  All right.  Dan's a Yankees fan, right?  He's got dirt in there.  He's kind of fun.  Dan gets the Yankees coasters, and Jeff in Baltimore, you get the dirt map. 
[02:35:00]  I don't need those.  I have some Voss CDs.  All right.  Hold on a line, Jeff.  What is this?  What we did is we took these coasters.  You know, you've got to put your drink on something.  Sure.  You want to put it on some dirt.  Sure.  So we actually made these cool coasters up for the different players and teams, and again,  dirt.  See, now the Derek Jeter dirt, I know you guys will be interested in this, actually has dirt  from the shortstop position.  Ah.  We have a guy that goes over the shortstop position when Derek plays, and we take the  dirt from that area.  Different than the dirt, obviously. 
[02:35:30]  Does the grounds crew get annoyed that they have to fill all these dirt holes?  Yes.  They get annoyed that they have to sing YMCA.  There's no question when I go to a ballpark, I need security now.  They're not loving me, especially around the equipment managers, all the stuff they've  now got to order more of.  It's not always the easiest going thing for me.  Pretty cool.  It's fine.  The teams are cooperative.  The Yankees have been really legendary because they're the first ones.  To go all the way.  I went to a bunch of teams to pitch this idea, and when I went to the Yankees, they were  really the first ones to get on board and help me organize this with MLB, with Howard 
[02:36:00]  Smith, and make the whole thing kind of happen.  So I'm very grateful.  A lot of times, you know, and the Yankees did it because they wanted to make sure their  stuff was real, wasn't slipping out of the clubhouse.  So there was an organization to it all, an authentication to it, and making sure that, you know, you see  these auctions, like, fans got a Lou Gehrig bat.  You don't know if it's real.  So they know that they had legendary players.  They want to make sure for their fans that, first and foremost, that whenever anything's  leaving the locker room, it was going to be real.  Wow.  That's how we got Yankee Steiner going, really. 
[02:36:30]  Very cool.  Which is one of my cooler projects, really.  Jay-Z Steiner, remember we talked about this.  Just, I'm hyped up, because I'm going to go in and present next week to them.  I'm hoping we can do something.  So remember, we talked about this.  I haven't talked about it with anyone yet.  Jay-Z.  Sounds cool.  Jay-Z, remember.  A small little plug.  Have you guys been following my What Else blog?  She has young kids.  You probably can't read that, but great blog on brandonsneiner.com.  Oh, I actually go there.  Do podcasts and just a little, you know, if you're a salesperson out there, you look for  sales tips. 
[02:37:00]  It's very cool.  I've been doing it since June.  I think there's like 10,000 people now on there a day reading the blog on What Else.  Just go to my website, brandonsneiner.com.  What, do you tell people how to be successful in business?  Usually what I'll do is I'll go to other people that are successful and ask for their  tips and I'll share them.  We should do an Opie and Anthony item for a goof.  Opie and Anthony sign baseball.  We don't merchandise anything on this show.  Nothing.  We don't even have shirts anymore.  We used to at least have shirts.  I would wear an Opie and Anthony shirt.  There's no question.  Who wouldn't? 
[02:37:30]  There's no doubt.  I would.  Anybody with breasts.  Who wouldn't?  A woman.  I have had some items that I like, the baseballs and stuff people get, like I had a pair of  game-worn Babe Ruth cleats, but I traded them for a lock of Ed Cranepool's hair.  All-time Ed.  That would have been a good trivia question.  Ed was the number, now he's number two.  David Wright broke his record.  Oh.  We like David Wright.  Good guy. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  Mets are lost.  It's not been easy for him.  That organization is lost.  Lost is a word.  You know that show Lost?  I can see that all of a sudden they show up and they're at City Field.  Yeah.  And that show, that would have been a good episode.  Oh, yeah.  Running to Fred Wolpont.  Running to Jeff Wolpont.  Right on the show.  It's like, oh, the Mets.  This has been a figment of our imagination.  This insanity and this losing.  You don't have to go with it.  Oh.  Oh.  We want to thank Brennan for stopping by. 
[02:38:30]  It's always a pleasure.  I'm going to go check out your organization.  I want to go up there and get the tour.  It's a, it's, it's, it's, you won't be disappointed.  Really?  Yeah.  It's pretty cool.  I mean, we, it's a wild place.  I just assume it's just a warehouse and everything's boxed up.  Not at all.  It's way more than that.  It's like a museum, frankly.  And we put a lot of energy and time into making that.  So when people come up there, it's, it's a couple hours.  Really?  There's so many things to look at and we want it to be fun and interactive.  We go to the whole history of autograph collecting to the history of Steiner.  I do have one more question because you're a collector yourself. 
[02:39:00]  I think you said that last time.  Do you have anything that you refuse to sell because it's just that, it means that much to you?  Oh, 100%.  Like what?  Well, first thing I have is my Thurman Munson autograph.  I got when I was 15.  When I went to the ballpark, I killed my mother.  Oh, you got it.  Wow.  I said, mom, I got to go to the games because I have tickets for tomorrow night.  We can't afford to go both nights.  I said, I'll go, I'll get a ticket.  I scalp a ticket.  I'm in the third row, a single ticket.  I'm yelling at Thurman Munson for two straight hours.  I go back to the hotel, which is the same hotel as the Yankees. 
[02:39:30]  I go in the elevator.  Did you play that?  No.  Okay.  Put my arm through the elevator door.  It's Thurman Munson's arm.  He comes in the elevator with me.  It's me and him.  Wow.  And he gets in my face and he goes, what do you want?  You've been screaming my name for two hours.  You nuts.  Oh, wow.  I said, I'm like 14 years old.  I just want your autograph and I have that program from that night.  I love that.  That's amazing.  Is that worth a lot?  Yeah.  It's actually worth a lot because he didn't sign a lot of autographs and it's a nice autograph  too.  So I keep that. 
[02:40:00]  And then also another thing I love is I do a show on Yes Network, Memories of the Game.  So I show up.  I said, Mariano, you got to have your collectibles.  We'll come in.  We're shooting you.  Talk about your favorite collectibles on the show.  I get to his house.  I wake his ass up.  He goes, what do you want?  He goes, I said, we're doing this interview.  He goes, I don't have anything.  I say, are you freaking kidding me?  Nothing.  So he takes the cameraman's box, which he has the videotapes in there, and cuts with a knife.  And you can see it.  It's right on camera.  You can see it on YouTube, this little thing, by the way. 
[02:40:30]  So he cuts it and he shows his glove what he uses as a kid out of the box.  And it's amazing.  And you see how he shows the process of cutting the box up to his glove?  And he folds it up, puts it in his pocket.  And I just love that.  I had him sign that.  It's one of my favorite collectibles because of that moment.  And then also just remember to be humble and how grateful we are to have what we have.  And he reminds me of that all the time.  And I love that story.  Oh, he would do that when he was so poor.  He would make gloves out of a box.  Yeah, he'd go to the back of the stores and all the kids would use boxes.  That's why his hands.  You know, Mariano's a great pitcher, but an incredible fielder. 
[02:41:00]  And that's why he used the boxes of the glove most of his childhood.  So you love that.  A glove, once you're playing with a cardboard box, a baseball glove is probably easy.  It's insane.  You don't watch the video.  It's on YouTube.  I remember you talking about this last time.  How old was he when he finally said, fuck it, and got a real mitt, you think?  Probably, I think, in high school.  What happened was at the beginning of his career, if we have a second to tell this story.  So he's in right field, right?  And he was always an outfielder.  That's why he was shagging and everything.  He loves the outfield. 
[02:41:30]  So they were getting rocked, and they were in this big game.  So they finally said, Mariano, can you come in and pitch?  He comes in, strikes out like the rest of the side.  There was a scout there that day, and they invite him to go to get scouted.  The next day, these guys are at his house inviting him.  So he goes, he says, we want to see you pitch.  He says, I only pitched a couple times.  So he goes to this crowd.  He figures the other pitchers are going to pitch first.  And he starts, he goes, we're going to see Mariano first.  And he gets up there, and he just started throwing bullets.  He just had a moment in time. 
[02:42:00]  And he started throwing.  The Yankees signed him up a week later.  No.  It's unbelievable.  That's how it went down?  Was that 94 years in?  No, no, no.  This is before the minor leagues.  It's the kid in a fishing village.  He's in a fishing village in Panama.  And he's playing right field.  All of a sudden, he goes in and pitches the last part of this game.  Somebody sees it and says, you know, something, we can invite him to this tryout.  The Yankees are coming down and doing this tryout.  They got three pitchers.  You're going to be the fourth.  He figures maybe he'll pitch at the end of the game in an inning.  The scout goes, we want to see Mariano first. 
[02:42:30]  He doesn't know why still to this day.  Gets on the mound.  He throws bullets.  Two innings.  Boom.  And then he gets the contract.  That's ridiculous luck.  Do you remember when he was a starting pitcher?  He started with the Yankees as a starting pitcher.  I forgot about that.  I always thought Torrey overused him.  I always hate, because Wetland was a ninth inning guy, and I always hated that Rivera would  come in eighth and ninth after Jeff Nelson and Mike Stanton left.  It was so scary, though, because sometimes you're just like, oh, God, just put Mariano  and get this over with. 
[02:43:00]  Could you blame him?  No, I understand it.  But he lost his lefty and his righty specialist, and then Graham Lloyd, he wasn't quite getting  done with Mike Stanton, and I think he would bring in Rivera, and I always hated to see  Rivera overused like that, because I'm like, you're cutting his career short.  I mean, Torrey's great, but I hated that.  But he's got such, you know, he's just got laser focus.  Like, a story he tells me, and I don't know if he's ever told this story before, but, you  know, back in Arizona, everybody looks at 2001 World Series, but, you know, they had to 
[02:43:30]  make a decision whether to close the dome or not.  You know, they had that retractable roof.  So he gets a call in the eighth inning, and that's when he fights the better batters,  the middle part of the order.  And he says to me, he goes, you know, I didn't realize how much energy it took.  It was very hot out.  And he wasted a lot of energy, and then he ran into the ruckus in the ninth inning.  Wasn't there an error?  He made Rivera threw the ball into the center field.  But the real play there in the ninth inning was the ball hit the brocious.  They were out at the mound, and he turns to Scottie.  He goes, Scottie, I got it.  Do not come and field the bunt. 
[02:44:00]  So the guy bunts, I forget his name.  I think it was Mark Grace.  He bunts.  And he throws the ball to third.  He's right off the mound like a cat.  Throws the ball to third, and then you see him in the replay bending over because you  think brocious is going to throw the ball to first for a double play.  I mean, they didn't make that play.  A lot of people talk about that play as being a decisive part of the fact they didn't  go get the double play, and Scottie just went for the safe out.  Normally, Mariano's going to go get you those extra outs, but he was a little tired,  I think.  That was the worst loss ever. 
[02:44:30]  Because, you know, because of 2001, and because of that hateable, hateable Randy Johnson.  The big unit.  The big unit.  And Kurt.  They were both together on that.  Kurt Schilling team.  That's when the Yankees won.  I think they won.  Each home team won all its home games.  It was one of the great World Series, really.  Because that was when Jeter hit the home run at 12-0-1, and then Brocious and Tino hit  the game winners.  They were supposed to let us win for 9-11.  Yeah.  The Japanese pitcher threw out the game.  It was two outs. 
[02:45:00]  No, the Japanese pitcher for Arizona throws his home run.  It was 9th inning, two outs.  And he hits the home run to tie it.  I'll never forget Sterling's calls on those.  And it was really...  And then Pettit came in game six and got destroyed, I think, 15-1 or something.  Some, 15-2 or something.  Yeah, we got killed.  Kicking the shit out of your score.  And you knew that the series was done then.  I go back to the big unit.  That story still makes me laugh.  He got denied by the big unit.  I got pictures with people.  We chased him. 
[02:45:30]  We basically chased him.  And he went and just wanted a picture with him.  And he said no in front of everybody.  You know what's amazing?  He's a tool.  He really is a tool.  He loves the big unit.  He's like 10 years old at the time.  So I get him.  We have our first-row seats at Yankee Stadium.  I arrange for the big unit to come over and say hello to my son.  He comes over, says hello to him, and won't take a picture with him.  And won't sign his autograph.  My little kid was sitting up there like, what a jerk-off to a 10-year-old.  But then when he came to play for the Yankees, he was very nice. 
[02:46:00]  I don't know.  Maybe we just had a bad day that day.  He said he was very nice.  Oh, this is when he was in Seattle?  He was in Seattle, yeah.  No, he comes across like he's a kid.  With Arizona.  With Arizona.  So he said, what your kid said.  No, with Seattle.  With Seattle.  You said, kids, you got a picture and autograph?  He said no.  He said no, yeah.  What a crazy.  What do you do in those situations?  That was an aha moment for me and my kid.  Because it was the first time we were ever in the Yankee dugout.  Joe Trude invited us.  So we're in the dugout.  My kid goes, Dad, can we go to our seats now?  Mike Crosby.  We're not leaving this dugout until they kick us out. 
[02:46:30]  I've waited 50 years to be in this dugout.  I don't want to leave.  So finally we go.  The kid's like, we've got to go to the seat because we're going to meet Randy Johnson.  And oh my God, my kid's face was just, I don't know, that's going to be therapy.  Did he ever get his picture with Randy?  No.  No, he was done.  He moved on.  That was it.  Yeah.  He was done with Randy Johnson.  He's a hateable guy.  When he came to the Yankees, he was nice.  He was definitely a lot nicer to us.  He had to be.  They would have killed him.  That was a bad day, man.  That was a bad day for my son. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, God.  Was Randy nice to talk to him or no?  It was like 30 seconds.  As soon as we asked for the picture, he walked away.  Didn't even say goodbye.  Oh, God.  How do you get to a table?  I heard he gets really weird on game days.  That was his thing.  He's very weird on game days.  Enough already with these guys.  Really?  Just an absolute asshole.  You've got a great life.  Relax.  Big, tall, lanky douche with stupid 1980 Foxworthy hair.  He really irritates me.  We ran out of the Brooklyn Diner.  We saw a head just walk by the window. 
[02:47:30]  Because the windows are up pretty high.  And obviously, Randy Johnson is pretty damn tall.  We just saw his head.  Yeah.  And we're like, holy fuck, that's Randy Johnson.  So we ran out because he wanted a picture.  And Randy's like, nah, nah, nah, nah.  He goes, no, no, thank you.  Yeah, he says, no, thank you.  I got a picture of him walking across.  I bashed him on my book, though.  That was very satisfying.  Yeah.  Fucking dopey giraffe.  I got Curt Schilling in mine.  You bashed him?  Yeah, killed Curt Schilling.  Good.  I killed him.  That's good.  The only player that killed in the book killed him.  Killed him.  Because he deserved to be killed.  What else about him?  Yeah.  I mean, you had that one moment where he wouldn't let his own teammates at his house. 
[02:48:00]  His signature sucked.  You know, he wouldn't sign his full name.  He wouldn't sign his autograph so you can read it.  That's important.  You guys, too?  Oh, it's critical.  Right.  And then it just, you know, just the little things like when we'd be able to do the signing.  Like one time, there's me now.  I go to the hotel.  We had to do the signing.  And we had a little problem with UPS bringing the shit.  So we were delayed.  We're calling UPS to find out where these items were that he was going to sign.  And he's having a temper tantrum.  I'm like, excuse me.  The amount of money I'm paying you, you can wait 15 minutes.  Really?  Are you kidding me?  And he was like, you wouldn't wait. 
[02:48:30]  He's like, I'm out of here.  I'm leaving.  I'm like, this is me now.  I'm not some signing guy over here.  I'm here now.  I'm like, are you kidding?  And he was just, he just was, he was dead.  Did he stay?  No.  He wouldn't stay.  So we end up, all the stuff got shipped to the hotel and he ended up having to reschedule it.  Because he wouldn't wait 15, 20 minutes.  Meanwhile, all his teammates are signing.  And they're laughing at him.  So, you know, if you ask his teammates, they'll tell the better stories.  I'm sure.  You know, the fact that, you know, he just, he's, he's, you know, I don't know.  He's a jerk off.  But he's so religious.  He's supposed to be such a nice person. 
[02:49:00]  I don't know what happened to him.  But in our dealings, it was terrible.  I remember him being a really nice guy.  But that goes back.  But that's a rarity.  I mean, most of the guys we deal with are good.  Most of the guys we deal with are really nice guys.  We're happy.  You know, Steiner Sports, if you look at our roster,  Rayo, do we run into a Curt Schilling every now and then.  And usually there's some other stuff going on that has a little to do with us  that makes these guys, you know, miserable.  They're going through a divorce, a slump, broke, you know, whatever.  Right.  So it's been fun being on your show, man. 
[02:49:30]  Hopefully I increased the popularity.  We got a few more listeners.  Don't just still lit.  They want stuff.  We gave a little – we got one more thing to give away if we want to give away  one more thing.  All right.  We got the Derek Jeter coasters.  Let's go to Jay on Long Island.  Jay, you want some Derek Jeter coasters?  Are they signed by them or anything or no?  Absolutely.  I'll take them.  Okay.  They'll be a first time in a long time.  How you doing, man?  What's up, Jay?  Actually, Brandon, I did have a quick question, if I may.  All right.  I have a collection, actually, of old Super Bowl programs, one through ten.  Is there a market for those? 
[02:50:00]  If they're in good shape, the early ones, yes.  You know, definitely the first five or six, no question.  You've got to authenticate them.  I've got to have them framed.  They're going to be in my shop for a while.  I have one from Super Bowl VII with about 15 autographs on it, including players, Howard  for a close sellout.  There's people in the stands that day.  Send it in.  I'll sign it.  If you go to my Facebook, you know, I'm easily found on Facebook.  If you just go to Brandon Steiner on Facebook and send me a message, I'll get back to you  and what to do with that and add a photograph of those. 
[02:50:30]  We'll tell you what they're worth.  And if you want to sell them, we'll probably help you sell them as well.  You get a little taste of that, Brandon?  Yeah.  A little taste?  Yeah, we have to.  How about an actual picture signed by WWE's or F's at the time, Virgil, who was the million-dollar  man's ballet.  Big following on the WWE.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, it's amazing.  Every time we put, we have a store in Roosevelt Field and we put our wrestlers there, the  Steiner store, and it's, I mean, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people show up  for one wrestler. 
[02:51:00]  Not Virgil, though.  Well, Steve Austin, guys like that.  Oh, yes.  Stone Cold is huge.  Stone Cold was, one time Stone Cold was on the highway, he was running a little late,  and we had like 800 people waiting for his autograph.  I didn't know what to do.  And he was late, and I think these people, they're all in, they're all in.  Yeah, couldn't find a can opener.  I think they were going to kill me.  And he needed to open up a can of whoop-ass.  He had no can opener.  He doesn't come out of character, either.  Like, even when he got there, he was like, he was on once.  Yeah.  And it's on to something, though.  You're missing out on Virgil. 
[02:51:30]  Look at the line of the Virgil song.  Poor Virgil.  No one cares.  Life is humbling, isn't it?  Poor Virgil.  Stupid Virgil.  Wow, that's cold, man.  All right, so what's this guy going to do for the coasters before we say goodbye?  I think we'll just give it to him.  All right, Chad, just give it to the guy.  Sometimes our brother's just got to get a break.  Yeah.  Cool.  Thanks, Brandon.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Brandon Steiner, a pleasure.  The book is still out there doing very well.  What's the name of it again?  You've got to have balls.  You can pick it up on SteinerSports.com.  And go to my website, BrandonSteiner.com. 
[02:52:00]  Pick up the blog.  It's free.  Okay, very cool.  Thank you, man.  I really appreciate it.  We'll be right with you guys.  Good stuff.  We'll see you next time.  Brandon Steiner, everyone.  Can I get a t-shirt?  Oh, you don't have any.  Right.  You don't have any.  That's going to hurt.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony Show.  Today is the day. 
[02:52:30]  We're like Billy, right?  At Billy on Twitter.  Uh-huh.  Billy.  Billy.  He had an all right time with us.  Yeah, he was good.  Who?  Billy Corgan.  Oh, yeah.  Billy Corgan.  He's got a fucking monster that was in court and got convicted of a murder. 
[02:53:00]  And what he said to the fucking family.  A piece of garbage from Ohio.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Brutal.  Just fucking kill him.  I masturbate.  I used the same finger I used on my trigger to masturbate.  Thinking of what I did or something.  But do you know what?  And he took his shirt off and it said killer on his t-shirt.  He's a crazy person, but he's a little fucking cocksucker. 
[02:53:30]  One of the other students was there or somebody who knew him.  And they brushed it off.  They said he sounded like a scared little boy.  Oh, he's going to be petrified in prison.  He's just trying to be crazy before he goes to jail.  Do we have audio of that or no?  Let's hear that.  He's a hateable guy.  He's not going to do well in prison.  I hope they put him in general population.  They won't, though.  Put these guys in general pop.  No.  Just do it.  All right, let's see.  We can't hear it. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, that's fake.  Yeah, he's like, hey, you're triggered, masturbation, fuck you up.  That's a scared little boy right there.  But he's so hateable.  You think that, like, how does a guard resist just knocking his teeth?  I mean, I'm going to give you a pen.  Oh, the CNN anchor's crying over what's going to happen to him?  Are they talking about how awful it is that his life is thrown away?  Jimmy.  Can we hear that again?  Really got part of it, right?  That sound doesn't kick in until. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah, I know.  What a little brat.  Oh, he is going to get ravaged.  Is he one of the Gallagher brothers?  He has that vibe to him.  All right.  What a little brat.  Yeah.  How great would it be to see his fucking teeth just knocked out?  I believe it'll happen.  I don't know.  I'm so sick of hearing about convicts have justice.  They don't do anything.  If you cut them in line, they kill you.  They don't care if you rape kids. 
[02:55:00]  They don't do a fucking thing.  Yeah, but he might be fuckable.  Yeah, he is.  You know?  He's, uh...  You look in prison, he's a model.  He's going to be well protected.  Well, of course.  Nothing's going to happen to this kid any time soon.  I don't know.  Got to hope something happens to him.  Then you got the lawyer of the Ohio rapist speaking up today.  Oh, good.  Oh, what happened there?  Oh, well, wait till you hear this.  Oh, boy.  He's got a little angle.  Oh, boy.  A little angle on what's going on there in Steubenville.  Oh, Ohio.  We all know the story. 
[02:55:30]  The football players, right?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  I don't believe he should have to register as a sex offender till he dies.  Well, that is part of the punishment.  If, in fact, he is guilty of this crime, he does have to register as a sex offender.  That's unfair.  And others need to know that is one of the consequences of rape.  I think you would be in a minority in that opinion.  No.  I don't think you should have to explain to your grandchildren when you're...  Well, you'll have your chance, Ms. Lourdes.  I don't believe that a person at 75 years old should have to explain for something they  did at 16 when scientific evidence would support your brain isn't fully developed. 
[02:56:00]  When the evidence in a case would suggest that you were under the influence.  Listen, I've got three teenage sons, and when you get to 16, 17, your brain's developed  enough to know you shouldn't be raping girls.  Well, there are people that know better than you that would disagree.  Well, I don't think so.  Honestly, I think you get to 17, you're a late teen.  You're nearly a man.  So this guy is saying that one year away from being military age, you don't know that doing  that to a girl is wrong. 
[02:56:30]  And he's also saying that we trust you with the keys to a car at age 17, but you don't  know that kind of raping a chick with your hand and jerking off on her is wrong.  This lawyer is a fucking cunt.  And she has to explain to her grandchildren that that video that is out there and those  photos that are out there.  What happened?  Well, they were, you know, they kind of took advantage of me and they were fingering me  in the car and they were passing me around and they were fucking.  So he shouldn't fuck him and fuck his grandchildren. 
[02:57:00]  Fuck his explanation.  Yeah.  I think I learned something though.  When you register as a sex offender, it's for your life.  Yes.  I did not know that.  I thought it was, I thought it was more of a sentence where you have to, you know,  do that for a certain amount of years.  You know what I think the recidivism rate in sex offenders, and again, maybe not this  guy, but the recidivism rate is so high and people are just sick and tired of being victimized  by these fucking pieces of garbage.  I'm not saying I don't get it.  And I'm not saying I shouldn't have registered 30 or 40 different times.  You find it creepy when you do the sex offender map and see how many fucking dots there 
[02:57:30]  are.  Exactly.  No matter where you fucking live.  Sure.  Holy fuck.  Especially when the beep is getting really loud.  It's like, that ping is coming from inside the house.  Oh, it's me.  Holy fuck though.  Do you think it's here and there?  But man, no matter where you live, there's just a shitload of dots on that map.  I'm doing something for Comedy Central.  Oh, can you tell us?  Off the air, I don't know if I'm allowed to say it yet.  I mean, again, it's nothing major, but I'm doing that.  And because there's going to be some children around, they have to do a background check 
[02:58:00]  and all that.  It's a Viacom thing.  They want to make sure no fucking...  And I get it.  Children around.  They don't want to get sued because I'm fucking creep.  You know, I think it's a smart move.  Wow.  Another story involving a child.  You read about that guy.  His son took a picture with a little AR-15 type rifle, 22, outside his house.  He's wearing little fatigues and stuff like that. 
[02:58:30]  He's holding the gun very safely.  Apparently, his father is an instructor for the NRA, and so they posted that picture on  Facebook, and like the Department of fucking Social Services comes knocking on the door  with four cops, and they want to coincide.  They want to look in his gun safe, see what guns he owns, ask him questions about that, 
[02:59:00]  thinking that maybe the child's welfare is in danger.  Ridiculous.  Can I ask you...  Ridiculous.  And I think you're probably right.  Let me see the picture.  But how are we...  I say we, but what is the appropriate reaction when the pattern is developed?  Like, you know how you talk about patterns and how the cops have to stop certain people  because...  And I agree with you.  They do.  But when patterns of fucking school shootings have been happening...  Right.  And so many of them are posting these kind of pictures, and this is in the pattern, 
[02:59:30]  how are we supposed to react?  Like, we always say, well, you've got to cut it off before it happens.  And in the process of cutting it off before it happens, you're going to wind up talking  to a lot of innocent people.  It's like stop and frisk.  You're going to wind up stopping and frisking a lot of innocent people.  They were asking to, without a warrant, enter this guy's house and look at his weapons.  That's out of the question.  And did he say yes or no?  He said no.  Okay.  His wife was there.  His wife called him up.  He got on the phone and conference with his lawyer and started talking to these people 
[03:00:00]  and saying, no, you do not let them in the house.  They don't have a warrant.  They're not allowed in this house.  Get the name of the woman that is with the Department of Social Services or whatever,  this child welfare.  And she wouldn't give her name.  Wouldn't even give her fucking name.  The woman wouldn't give her name.  And she fucking left.  And the cops, he said the cops were very cool about it.  They were there because they were asked to come there with the person.  And they all just left. 
[03:00:30]  But they wanted to come in and, without a warrant, search this guy's house.  And I understand him saying no.  And I'm not saying that they should be allowed to do that.  Yeah.  But going there, what is the appropriate reality?  How about a little more research like this?  Look, it's this guy's Facebook.  His picture's there.  There's other family pictures on there.  He's obviously a shooting enthusiast.  That isn't a lunatic that's going to go and shoot up a school.  And you can't just start infringing on people's rights because you think a picture might. 
[03:01:00]  And it was somebody on Facebook that ratted out saying, oh, that's terrible.  They ought to.  I agree.  But it's almost like when you look at somebody in a thug outfit, like immediately you make a judgment on them.  Sure.  And it's the same thing with this now because most people who are doing school shootings, they're young white guys.  They dress in the shoes.  It's like, I mean, people's toes are going to get stepped on when you're trying to do preventative measures.  Kid's pretty young.  How old is he? 
[03:01:30]  10?  A little kid, yeah.  Maybe 10, 11 tops.  Something like that.  No, I don't think that they should be able to go into this guy's house and take it.  I'm not saying any of that.  And it's annoying that she wouldn't give her name.  The second you give up that right where they need a warrant to come into your house, it's fucking really over at that point.  It's fucking done.  That's not going to happen.  I told you they wouldn't take the guns.  They're trying so hard.  Did he make the...  Oh, because they didn't have the votes.  They tried.  Yeah.  They're trying.  They won't get it.  The thing is, the American people love their guns.  They had to pull the assault weapons ban off of Feinstein's bill. 
[03:02:00]  But, you know, it doesn't help New Yorkers.  We already have a ban, so we're fucked.  But believe me, their intent is to take the guns away.  It's just a matter of they don't have enough votes right now.  And like I said earlier, all they do now is they're posturing.  Every politician you see, every decision that's made by the president, by Congress, they are posturing for 2014. 
[03:02:30]  They're just...  They're campaigning.  You're watching a campaign right now with this fucking sequester shit.  Everything they do with this sequestering is campaigning for the midterm elections in 2014.  So you're not getting honesty.  You're not getting true representation.  You're getting guys that want to keep their fucking job.  But at least they'll start governing after 2014.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, wait.  That's right.  Then they've got to start campaigning for president again.  It's just a never-ending cycle of not working. 
[03:03:00]  Nothing gets done.  It's all...  All they do now is try to hold on to their job.  And by doing...  And to do that, they have to not do a lot of things.  And what they do, they want it to look like the other side is to blame.  This sequester thing is going back and forth between the Republicans won't fucking give an inch, so it's their fault.  And the other ones are, well, Obama signed the fucking thing.  He's the one that signed it into law.  So that gets... 
[03:03:30]  And then the Obama administration starts cutting back on these very public, very visual things.  Saying it's the sequester.  The fucking Easter egg roll.  The White House tours.  Why are they canceling that?  Well, we can't afford it.  Sequester, sequester.  Meanwhile, that's nothing compared to other things that are still enacted and not taken away.  How about we take away some of this fucking welfare shit?  I'm so sick of welfare, by the way.  So sick of those motherfuckers.  I mean, I'm sure people need it and actually deserve it, but you better prove it. 
[03:04:00]  And there should be drug fucking testing.  If you have to fucking drug test in order to work, to make money, why can't you drug test in order to not work to make fucking money?  Absolutely.  Tired of it.  And the restriction, there should be such strict restrictions on what you can and can't buy with that shit.  I was looking at hair places and nail places with big signs.  EBT accepted.  Fuck you and your stupid hair and your nails and soda and candy and shit. 
[03:04:30]  That should be for real food to feed your kids, fuckwad puppy.  It's funny how Bloomberg wants to get involved with the soda ban and all this shit.  But you want to be healthy, cocksucker mayor?  How about you mandate that they can only buy healthy food with food stamps for all welfare?  How about you do that?  If you want to buy something with your money that you earned and stuff, fine.  If you're on the dole and getting government and taxpayers money, yeah, you've got to be accountable for that. 
[03:05:00]  Then, yeah, we want to know what you're fucking buying and not buying with it at this point.  And there's so much shit going on where people have been on the dole for a dozen years.  Fresh at 18, they get on it and they just stay there because that's their job.  Their job is to collect fucking welfare.  Amazing.  I've had it.  Had it.  Because it's such waste. 
[03:05:30]  And then we look at things like the sequester and the Easter egg roll is going to be cut.  Yet every fucking month, those checks are going out to a fuckload of bums.  I mean, and I'm not saying everybody is a bum.  There are probably some very well-deserving people that need it.  But it's supposed to be there to assist.  It's public assistance.  Not to stay on it for generations and generations and make people dependent.  They are now completely dependent on welfare. 
[03:06:00]  You said something there.  You're at the stage where you've had it.  What happens now?  I speak up about it.  That's all I can do.  But I used to be so quiet about these things.  I get people that read my Twitter and they go,  Anthony, what happened to you?  What happened to me?  I'm tired of it.  I'm fed up there.  Some people fucking go off the deep end.  Other people just discuss it and talk about it.  I'll never be rude or anything on Twitter.  I'll never be nasty when I'm having a discussion with people.  You know, on myself, I'll be very rude and nasty. 
[03:06:30]  By the sound, the sound you heard of shock and disbelief with everyone else who follows  Anthony on Twitter.  If I'm having a genuine debate with somebody, believe me, I will be nasty.  But if I'm having a debate with somebody, I'll try to keep it as civil as possible.  I'll never just be like, fuck you, asshole, or, you know, just take their point and poo-poo it.  But, I mean, I'll have a debate with somebody if they want to have a...  I think what you should do is follow Harvey Levin's lead, though. 
[03:07:00]  Just ask the questions.  Ask questions?  Just ask the questions.  Don't give the opinions.  Let them do all the heavy lifting.  You know what I mean?  Hey, like, oh, you know, welfare.  What do you think of it?  I think a lot of people that are on welfare are totally capable of working.  And I think it's terrible that they're taking taxpayers' monies.  What do you think?  Are they?  Or are they not?  Discuss.  Yeah, I've had it.  They don't drug test of EBT. 
[03:07:30]  They drug test for welfare.  Oh, yeah?  Well, that's state by state.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm just, it's so infuriating.  I was watching so many fucking videos last night on the welfare system and just the money  that just gets thrown out without any accountability whatsoever.  And testimony from people that are saying, yeah, I'm just getting free money.  Why would I want to work? 
[03:08:00]  EBT, it's for free.  And you just, so many places accept taxpayers' welfare money that shouldn't.  You shouldn't, you shouldn't be able to get extensions on welfare.  You shouldn't be able to get your fucking nails done.  Big two-liter bottle of soda, go fuck yourself.  Give your kid juice.  Have you ever spent time looking at positive videos of just good things that are happening  in the world?  Anything positive is nudity.  I just look at naked girls. 
[03:08:30]  There you go.  I look at horrible things that affect our nation.  And if I want the positive side, naked girls.  I love looking at totally nude girls online.  They're beautiful.  Yeah.  I don't know what to do, though.  You're right.  I say I'm fed up and I'm tired of it, but there's nothing you can really do.  And then I hear New York State, good old Cuomo, is raising the taxes on, of course, the wealthiest 
[03:09:00]  of New Yorkers, which in New York, especially the city, the line they made is middle class.  You're missing the point.  You really are.  I heard this on the way in.  Yeah.  It was supposed to be a temporary tax.  Temporary, right.  So it's another politician lying through their fucking teeth.  Yes.  Back in, what year did he say this was?  2006.  I want to say, yeah, either 2006 or 2008.  He put a tax in and said, it's going to be temporary.  Everyone relax. 
[03:09:30]  Everyone just calm the fuck down.  It's just temporary.  We need the money.  And then, you know, people forget.  Fast forward a bunch of years.  And then that temporary tax, of course, is not temporary anymore.  Another just lying piece of shit.  And did you hear why they want to sign it now?  Why?  Because it's supposed to expire in the election year in 2014.  But they don't want a big argument about it and make it an election issue.  I see.  So, in other words, they don't want the American people to actually have an open discussion,  let their politicians know how they feel about it, so they can vote on it during an election year, 
[03:10:00]  where they're held accountable for what they're fucking doing.  So now they'll slide it in now, so that by the time it's 2014 and the elections come around,  bah, who cares?  I am truly amazed by anyone that believes in a politician.  I'm just amazed.  They're just cock-sucking pigs.  And what, it affects everybody, or is it just the rich?  It's a rich tax, right?  Yeah, another one of the wealthiest of Americans.  Even Bill Maher, holy shit, even fucking Bill Maher is coming around. 
[03:10:30]  That liberal piece of shit was on his show with Rachel Maddow and a couple of the lib fucking douchebags.  And he said, he goes, you liberals, you're going to lose me, because you're going to lose me.  The tax that he's paying in California, he said he can't take it.  They're taking so much money.  And even he said, and being told, you know, you're not doing your fair share.  It's the same rant I've been on for years.  And, you know, you made your bed, you fucking asshole. 
[03:11:00]  You gave a million bucks to the administration that wants to jack your fucking taxes up, you shithead.  I think he's up to 55% he pays.  Yeah.  I think that's what he said.  And you know what?  So it's more than half now for him.  You know what?  It reaches a point where even fucking Bill Maher is like, hey, this might be enough.  It should never be more than half.  Ah, crazy.  It should never be more than 25%.  25%, but then now you're talking like where you work your balls off and the government actually benefits more than you.  That's crazy.  And the worst part of it is paying that much and just having to day after day watch the news, read, read, that you're not doing enough and be villainized still. 
[03:11:30]  Like, oh, you're the rich, the this, the banker, this, that, that, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And you sit there and go, what the fuck?  You'd love to just pull it and say, really?  Really?  How about I don't give you anything?  And then you go to prison.  But it would be lovely if all these wealthiest of Americans decided not to pay and watch what happens when 70 fucking five to 80% of your revenue goes away. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  They'd come after you.  Of course they would.  You first.  But yeah, yeah.  Me first.  How about everybody?  Just it's how we got to this point where we're paying this much.  The, the, the, the, our representatives do not represent us at all anymore.  There's no recourse for you to do anything except pay.  Pay or go to jail.  It's pure extortion.  Pure. 
[03:12:30]  Crazy.  America.  Great.  We're the freest nation of the world.  We're the greatest nation.  Shut the fuck up.  The principle is great.  The whole idea behind it is great.  And at one time, I bet it was great.  This place sucks.  We were talking about baseball dirt and now you got everyone sad.  Oh.  Yep.  We were having fun with baseball dirt.  You do remember that, right?  Yeah.  I forgot.  Look.  Mission accomplished.  10 o'clock. 
[03:13:00]  Fair enough.  Can I plug something?  My show's coming up, but I have to plug something.  Oh.  Jimmy's on today.  Syracuse.  This Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Saturday's totally sold out.  Friday almost is.  So go to the Thursday or Late Show Friday, April 11th through 14th here in New York at  Caroline's.  And Saturday, April 27th, I'm in Austin at the Moon Tower Comedy Festival.  One show only.  Oh, very good.  Thank you.  And Asti Spumanti.  Opie and Anthony have left the building.  The phone lines are open. 
[03:13:30]  And the Jim Norton Show starts now.  Yes, it does.  And yes, I am.  Jim Norton here doing my hour of mediocrity.  I have auditions today.  I have to put myself on tape for a movie.  I'm trying out for five different parts.  They're all very small.  And of course, most of the stuff is cast in L.A.  But I'm hoping I can get one of them.  You know, a few lines, four or five lines. 
[03:14:00]  Bing, boom.  You read it, boom.  You get it, you don't get it, boom.  You know, the results are out of your hand.  That's what I'm kind of hoping for.  Major motion picture?  Major motion picture?  Yes.  But small to comedy.  And you're putting yourself on tape.  I bought a GoPro.  And that was why I bought it.  Because I want to do some exciting things with it.  And of course, the touch screen that I bought, in addition, stinks.  It's fucking, you know, I'm touching it and it's shutting off.  It's like, you cock.  I have no luck with technology. 
[03:14:30]  I just don't.  I don't have that gift.  But that thing that Anthony has, which enables him to just, like, almost reverse engineer things and put things together, I don't have the ability to do that.  I wish I did.  And we have a caller here.  What kind of advice is this?  Follow up on the welfare debate from O&A.  I guess we'll talk to you for a second, but I don't know what you want to say about it.  What's his name?  Shawnee?  Snowy in Michigan.  Snowy in Michigan.  Oh, well.  Hey, how you doing, Jim? 
[03:15:00]  Hello.  First, I'd like to apologize for all the assholes that didn't show up for your show.  No, it's okay.  The people that came were great.  I'm one of the people who would love to see, you know, but I'm sitting at going to say, hey, come on, go to Detroit, so no one will show up.  And so, I'm a truck driver.  It's kind of hard for me to get.  So, I've got to go.  Okay.  The other thing I wanted to mention, you mentioned about people on, you know, welfare should only pay for healthy food.  But sometimes that healthy food is more expensive than the cheap stuff.  I agree.  You shouldn't be buying, like, candy bars, getting hair extensions and everything else. 
[03:15:30]  That's absolutely ridiculous.  But sometimes the unhealthy stuff is cheaper than the...  That's a good point.  I don't mean only organic.  And thank you for the call.  I appreciate it, Snowy.  I don't mean only organic food.  Like, you know, only organically grown.  I'm just talking about healthy stuff.  Like, you can't buy chocolate bars with it.  You can buy rice, and you can buy, you know, tuna fish, and you can buy meat and hamburger meat,  but you can't buy just absolute shit. 
[03:16:00]  That's what I mean.  Okay.  We have...  No.  And let's try Tony.  Tony in Cleveland.  You're on.  Hey, how's it going, Norton?  Hi, buddy.  Hey, your GoPro.  I've got the same one.  I've got the HD2 and the new HD3, and the little touchscreen that's on the back does  blow dick, because first of all, it's way too small.  Get the app for your iPad or your iPhone.  Yeah.  It works wonders.  There's a little tiny, like, time delay in the Wi-Fi part of it. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  But they're also supposed to be coming out where it'll be Bluetooth.  It'll make it faster.  Okay.  You know, you've got your iPad, and it's just much easier to control and see what you're  doing from that.  Okay.  Yeah, because I'm not blown away so far with this dumb GoPro.  I think it gives good video, but the little black-and-white monitor on the front of it  fucking stinks.  What is it, 1978?  It's awful.  Yeah, that's why on the GoPro, on the app, it shows everything.  It shows if you're recording, your time, anything you need to... 
[03:17:00]  You know, it's like that screen, but bigger, plus then it becomes your visual screen.  I use it in my semi.  As I'm driving on the road, I videotae in case somebody shuts me, you know, cuts me off  or it does something stupid.  I got proof.  Okay.  And I've got my iPad sitting right there, and it's beautiful.  Okay.  Thank you very much.  Go to the Norton.  Take care.  Yeah, the phones are not exactly lit, so maybe this show has run its course.  What's the number? 
[03:17:30]  866-969-1969.  Yeah, so call in if you need advice.  That will take two minutes to get out there.  Because people are calling.  Like, we have phones, but they're not really advice.  I want Jim to go to Austin, Texas, like Patrice.  I'm not going to take that call, but thank you, Jack.  That's nice of you to say.  And I am doing Austin, as I promoted earlier.  I'm doing the Moontower Comedy Festival April 27th.  And no one was acknowledging me doing the Edgar voice.  Thank you, Darren, from North Carolina.  Nobody was.  I didn't know where to go with that statement. 
[03:18:00]  So I guess it's just you and me, Rock.  Because nobody seems to want advice from me today.  I'm going to have to get Bailey J. back on this show, because Bailey, the phones were lit for.  And people were still talking about that on Twitter and everything well after that show was done.  Bailey is great.  Bailey is fantastic.  And I want to do something else with her.  I mean, obviously.  Oh, wow.  The phones are now lit.  There you go.  It takes a little bit.  We had to give the number out.  That was fucking fast.  It's on the screen, but okay.  I don't know, but people are busy.  They don't look at their screens.  They're driving responsibly.  And maybe when I can...  You know what it is?  This show is so popular, people don't think they'll get through. 
[03:18:30]  That is true.  People are afraid to call.  Let's go for the last one.  Mike.  Mike, you're on.  Hey, Jimmy.  What's going on?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, I got married three weeks ago to my girlfriend.  We were together for almost two years.  Oh, cool.  Hopefully you have a better honeymoon than Manny and Gina did in Scarface.  Go ahead.  Because he killed them.  It's not the same honeymoon.  We started to fuck together. 
[03:19:00]  What?  Yeah, no sex.  I've tried.  Believe me, I have.  Wait, how long did you date her for?  Two years.  You never fucked her?  We fucked all the time until we got married.  Oh, okay.  And then on the honeymoon and now, what's her reason?  Wedding night, she was too drunk.  Okay.  And every night after that, she's been too tired.  Did you do anything that she's mad at you for?  I don't know.  Like, I've tried every angle. 
[03:19:30]  I've asked her if, you know, if it's something I did, is there something that I'm not doing  to turn you on?  Because up until that point, we were doing everything, you know, getting dirty, eating  ass, just fucking, like, nonstop.  As soon as the wedding happened, it just turned off.  Well, maybe she's feeling, you know, guys are always panicking about being married, but  maybe this time she is.  You know, maybe that's the problem.  Maybe she's kind of freaking out. 
[03:20:00]  That could be the big issue.  Maybe she's freaked out that she's married now, and you're not.  So maybe she's just...  Do you think it could be it since her second marriage, and it's my first?  Don't know, bro.  That's weird.  The first few weeks, you're supposed to be fucking a lot.  That's what I thought.  And I've talked to a couple of my friends, guys and girls, and my guy friends laugh at  me, and my girlfriend, and my friends that are girls that are friends with both of us.  They don't get it.  Well, can you still divorce her? 
[03:20:30]  Yeah.  I don't know.  Pull your dick out and say, look, if this thing doesn't stink in a couple of hours, well,  you're history.  That's kind of my next draw.  I was just going to slap her in the face, but I still fucking just takes it.  All right.  Good luck, my friend.  Hey, thank you, sir.  Let's go to Rick in Pennsylvania.  Hey, Rick.  What's up, buddy?  Hey.  Kind of a weird situation.  I've been married for almost 11 years. 
[03:21:00]  Pretty much happy all the time.  We've got two young kids that have a house, both have jobs.  Everything's good.  But a few months back, my wife owns her own business, and this guy started working with  her, and now I have this weird feeling.  I don't have any kind of solid proof, but I just have this weird feeling that she might  be cheating with him.  Well, I mean, there's a lot.  I don't know what to do.  Well, when she comes home late one night, lick her pussy.  And if it tastes delicious, she is.  No, I'm kidding.  I don't know.  You know, sometimes we just get insecure and paranoid for no reason. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah.  But there are other times where we have instincts.  And because we're intellectual, we're taught to deny instinct.  Like, you know how you just get a creepy feeling around somebody?  You don't feel right, or you feel like they have a violent tendency.  Sometimes you're wrong, but a lot of times you're right.  We have these nature-given instincts.  So you may very well know that somebody else is sniffing around and planting seed in what's  yours.  Like, that's what may go to that basic chimp shit. 
[03:22:00]  But what is it that makes you feel that way?  What in her behavior?  Because something changed.  There's just little things that, like, you know, after we had our second kid, she kind  of went through a depression thing, and she didn't take real good care of herself.  And, you know, she's a good person, so I stuck by her, and I stuck by her, and, you know,  she's a good wife and everything, good mom.  But she didn't take real good care of herself, and now all of a sudden, out of nowhere, she's  starting to take better care of herself.  She sounds weird, but she started trimming her pussy hair and, like, all these little things. 
[03:22:30]  And, like, last night out of nowhere, she goes, hey, turn on the baseball game.  Puerto Rico's playing.  And I'm like, what the fuck are you talking about?  You don't give a shit about Puerto Rico.  She goes, no, I've been watching it.  It's good.  What nationality is the guy?  He's Puerto Rican.  Okay, so here's something that may be happening.  That's why I think it's weird.  Well, maybe one of two things.  Maybe he makes her feel sexy, and you're not making her feel sexy.  Like, you love her, but maybe you're not making her feel sexy, and then this guy might have 
[03:23:00]  flirted with her or looked at her a certain way, or, you know, oh, mommy, you know, that's  a terrible, stereotypical Puerto Rican accent.  But maybe he did, said something that made her feel sexy.  Or maybe, uh, maybe that's to get you to notice.  Possibly.  I mean, look, she could be fucking him.  I don't, you know.  But maybe she's just trying to, because why else would she tell you to do, if she was  fucking this guy, would she be stupid enough, knowing that you know he's Puerto Rican, to  go, I've been watching Puerto Rican baseball turn this on? 
[03:23:30]  I would hope not.  Or maybe she's trying to get you to notice.  So should I, do I say something?  Do I just confront her about it?  She'll, and then I'm an asshole if she's not.  She'll, no, you're not if you ask her.  Confronting and asking when having a real talk are two different things.  Does she have a lock on her phone?  No.  Okay.  That's a good sign.  Um, do you want to hire somebody to follow her?  No.  Then I guess asking or talking to her is the only thing. 
[03:24:00]  I mean, how should I approach that?  Should I just be like, hey, I'm just, I've noticed some things.  Is there something going on?  Yeah.  Tell her how you're feeling.  I've been getting this uneasy feeling lately, which, uh, you know, you're, you've been married  11 years.  You know each other.  So if she's doing something differently, you're picking up on it.  But it may not be what you think.  It may not be that she's actually taken dick from this guy.  It may actually be that she wants you to, to, to, he makes her feel sexy.  And maybe you have been good to her, but haven't been giving her enough compliments or haven't 
[03:24:30]  been an animal eating her pussy anymore.  I don't know what it is you do.  Yeah.  I mean, we're, we're very affectionate.  You know, we always kiss each other.  Good morning and goodbye, you know, good night and say we love each other a lot, but we don't  have sex a lot.  Um, honestly, it's maybe once a month, if that, um, but she, she's been on antidepressants  for a couple of years.  Yeah.  So we've always kind of blamed that.  Well, talk to her, man.  Talk to her and ask her if you don't, I personally, I would say get somebody to follow her for one 
[03:25:00]  or two nights and that could, that could also alleviate your fear.  Like sometimes if you think someone's doing something and you, you spy on them a little  bit or you get someone to spy on them and you realize, Oh God, I'm fucking a crazy  person.  They're, they're, they're terrific.  They're not doing anything because I've suspected girlfriends who literally were not doing  anything.  So are you sure you're not cheating or you're not fucking intriguing with anybody?  Uh, you know, I, I've never cheated, but I've definitely done some things that were  not on the up and up.  Okay.  So the girls and flirted and that's what I've wondered if it's just me being suspicious 
[03:25:30]  because I know what I've done.  You're sneaky.  Yeah.  So maybe you're putting your shit on her too.  That's something we do too.  We project what we're doing onto other people.  Yeah.  Just talk to her.  All right.  Thanks buddy.  Hey, I love you, man.  Uh, your show is great.  And, uh, can't wait to come back to Pennsylvania.  I know it is.  Thank you, but I appreciate it.  Take care.  Okay.  Let's talk to, uh, Mike in Cleveland.  Another Mike.  I get a lot of Mikes.  Mikes are regular guys and they like me.  Hi, Mike.  Mike. 
[03:26:00]  Hey, buddy.  Um, hey, basically, uh, wife completely stopped playing out like two, three months ago.  We've gone through these short periods before.  Um, how long are you married?  Uh, two years.  Okay.  Ten though.  And, um, dude, getting, getting blowjobs has always been like pulling teeth.  It's always just been a straight boring sex.  Um, every now and then, you know, she fucking go off script.  Why'd you marry her?  Uh, yeah, I, I, I, I love her.  You know, I do. 
[03:26:30]  That sounds gay.  I'm sure.  But no, it doesn't, you know, been together forever, you know, since you're like 17.  Um, and it was awesome for a while.  And she, I think the impetus is, uh, she believed that I may have had an affair, which I didn't  about a year and a half ago.  I had no way to get out from under it.  She's convinced.  Um, I mean, and I can't even introduce her to this girl.  And, uh, and, you know, walk through the motions because she's actually a professional  contact.  Um, so it gets a little hairy there. 
[03:27:00]  Um, and she can't give me a solid reason as to why it's always the usual of, you know,  not communicating, not spending time.  I'm tired, busy.  Um, and I've tried everything, dude, from being forceful, um, to being, you know, laid back  and just, you know, taking her out, making her feel good about herself.  Um, do you kiss her?  All the time.  Okay.  Does your breath stink?  No.  Okay.  That sounds like a weird question, but there's sometimes we have something that's weird with 
[03:27:30]  us that we're not aware of that other, cause I've noticed it on girls and that's a deal  killer.  If it shifts, breath stinks all the time or has a weird chemical that I don't like in  her breath or something.  So I've just be aware of that and just think about it.  Maybe it doesn't at all, but just, it's something to think about.  That may not be the issue, but you know, don't not consider it.  Yeah.  I, I, well, I mean, I, dude, I even lost like a hundred pounds.  I mean, I, I got fit.  How much do you weigh? 
[03:28:00]  Um, down to 180.  That's nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, it, uh, knocked it all off.  I mean, tried, tried everything to position myself to, I don't know, just be a little more  healthy in that area and, uh, can't get over it, man.  You've tried therapy with her to get her to talk about whatever's bugging her?  Not yet.  You should.  Something might come out that you're doing or that she thinks you're doing, or she may  have a guilty conscious about something, or maybe she's just one of those people that  is not a great fuck and you knew it going in and you married her anyway. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, that's what I'm fearing.  Go, go to, uh, go to therapy with a try it because you've tried everything else.  And she hasn't given you anything in two or three months.  That annoys me for you.  Yeah.  It's rough, man.  It's pretty rough.  So, uh, all right.  Well, go to therapy, give us a call back and tell, tell me how it goes.  Seriously.  All right.  I'll do that, Jimmy.  Hey, thanks a lot, man.  I appreciate it.  Okay, buddy.  Good luck to you.  Thank you.  Who's the guy with the question about, uh, rehab?  Let's talk to John in Texas.  John.  Hey, John. 
[03:29:00]  Hey, Jimmy.  How you doing?  I'm good, buddy.  Thank you.  Hey, I got my mom.  She went to rehab two years ago, uh, for narcotics.  Uh, she was taking soma and she was just blitzed out of her mind.  Right.  She went to rehab, got out.  Now, two years later, she's drinking all the time.  Okay.  And it's not like she's drinking and passing out and we're having to pick up after or anything  like that.  She's just drinking beer casually. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  She's an alcoholic or addict.  Yeah.  She never drank beer casually before.  But as far as rehab goes, what do you do?  She was in for narcotics.  Do you call her hand and tell her, hey, you need to go back for beer?  It's one, it's like, um, first of all, do you know that she's not doing pills with  it?  Maybe that's how she can just drink casually because she only needs a little bit of beer.  No, I'm, I'm pretty positive.  She's not doing pills because she can't do pills like one or two. 
[03:30:00]  Okay.  She has to do a whole lot.  She passes out.  She almost died.  She has to go to hospital.  How long has she been drinking again?  Oh, probably for the past nine, 10 months.  Well, it seems like she's gearing up for a major relapse.  She's in a relapse obviously because she's drinking, but I mean on her drug of choice.  You should, uh, you should definitely talk to her about it because it's all the same  thing.  It's like with, you know, alcohol and drug, the addiction, I'm not saying people can't  drink socially, but if I'm addicted to booze was my favorite. 
[03:30:30]  I love that more than anything.  And I love pot, but I can't now do cocaine because I'm not drinking because it's  part of the same mess.  It's like sex addiction.  If I'm, if I'm jerking off to pornography, I can't think I'm doing well if I just jerk  off to different pornography or I can't think I'm healing sexually if I'm getting blowjobs  from hookers, which of course, you know, I am all of the above, but it's all part of  the same thing.  So she's actively using, she may not be using the drug of choice. 
[03:31:00]  She's actively using rehab can be great or it can be ineffective.  It all depends on what you want when you go there.  It's like going to a 12 step program, but that's probably where she should be.  She'd be going to 12 step meetings.  If she, you know, she has to have some kind of willingness to do that because you can't  make her.  Yeah.  Well, that's the other thing.  When she went in for the pills, my dad, I'm not saying he, he, he loves her and he cares  about it, about her, been married to her for 30 years, but he's not proactive on it.  Well, he's an enabler and he's probably codependent. 
[03:31:30]  They're codependent on each other.  And he's a, unless he's an alcoholic, he's a codependent person.  Like he's a co-alcoholic or co-addict.  He's not an alcoholic.  They just changed their lifestyle in the last 10 months where they're drinking beer casually,  like every Friday and Saturday night.  And she drinks beer every night at home.  She don't drink beer.  You know what I mean?  He's enabling her.  Um, and maybe she's trying to soften him up so she can eventually start doing pills  again without him freaking out.  But, uh, it sounds to me like, you know, when you live with somebody that long, who's active, 
[03:32:00]  you, you become a complete enabler and you feed off each other.  And sometimes the codependent person who's not the alcoholic or the addict wants the other  person to relapse.  And it's not that they don't love them.  It's because if you don't relapse, my role is non-existent.  A lot of times the person living with a sober person very subtly and not even consciously  sabotages or attempts to sabotage the wellbeing or the sobriety of the newly sober person because  they're afraid that without them drinking and doing drugs, I have no purpose. 
[03:32:30]  My purpose, which is, you know, cleaning you up and caring for you is no longer.  So it's a very, it's very deep psychological shit.  No one's doing it on purpose.  I would suggest talking to her about it.  She should probably be going to meetings of some sort.  Okay.  Yeah.  I appreciate it, Jimmy.  Good.  If worse comes to worse, good luck.  Go to, uh, one of the Anon programs, Al-Anon, Nar-Anon, any of these programs that are kind  of about people who live or deal with active alcoholics and drug addicts because you cannot  change them. 
[03:33:00]  It sounds trite, but you can only fix you.  Right.  Good luck, my friend.  Thanks, Jimmy.  You're very welcome.  I certainly hope it helped.  Remy in Missouri.  We got people from all over the fucking map today.  You rock.  That's why I like this show.  Remy, you're on.  I'm with a girl.  Uh, we just found out she's pregnant.  I love her to death.  I'm going to spend the rest of my life with her, but I can't stop thinking about fucking  other girls.  I was at the bar with a friend and I actually had to make her find her own ride home because  she was at the bar putting her hand on my chest and grabbing my hoodie. 
[03:33:30]  How do I keep myself away from that temptation?  So hard.  I mean, you just confirmed you're a male.  It's really, really hard.  Um, how do you stop yourself from being tempted?  You probably can't.  But the way to stop ourselves, and I say this from, you know, knowing it as opposed to practicing  it from doing things is to, you have to think it through.  Walk through the consequences.  Picture her being devastated by what you did or picture her, how badly you will hurt her  if she finds out. 
[03:34:00]  Picture coming home with chlamydia or herpes or crabs or something and giving that to her  and having to explain to her that you'd be traitor.  Well, that's pretty much why I, that's pretty much why I turned around and left the bar.  Sure.  I guess I just pretty much have to hope I don't get stuck in a stalled elevator with a  girl that wants to blow me.  Yeah, that's, but that's everyone, man.  That's really fucking difficult.  That's very difficult for any man to pull off.  I mean, I'm sure women have their trouble with it, but for us, it's hard.  So the fact that you walked away is, is something to be said for that. 
[03:34:30]  I, I think you should feel good about that.  And I can't say how you would not be tempted.  I think every person is tempted.  Um, unless a girl is dating me, then she's just so turned off to sex.  I would suggest, uh, just doing what you, what you did and weigh the options.  Just think of how badly it would hurt her is probably the way to keep yourself from cheating.  All right.  Thanks, man.  Good luck, you big cock stud.  Because a lot of people have been calling lately and asking me about like, you know,  like the guy who said his wife won't fuck him.

Nathan, you're on.  Hey, Jimmy.  How you doing?  I'm good, Nathan.  Thank you.  Thanks for taking my call.  Sure.  Yeah, I'm basically wondering, calling.  Before I left here, I moved here probably six weeks ago to Singapore for work.  And before I came, I was kind of seeing this girl and about everything was going great. 
[03:37:30]  And probably about five days before I left over here, we were supposed to spend the rest of the week together.  She kind of blindsided me and kind of said, you know, that we shouldn't basically, you know, didn't want to see me anymore, that we could kind of go our separate ways.  Do you think that's because you were moving to another country?  Possibly.  Okay.  But since then, it's kind of really, you know, to me because I didn't feel like I got to kind of say it. 
[03:38:00]  And I've been thinking about maybe possibly emailing her or contacting her, but I don't know if it's, you know, if it's a good thing to kind of just let it go and have let it just die.  How long did you date her for, Nathan, and how long have you been gone?  You'll be able to be there for six weeks.  How long did you date her for?  Probably about five, six months.  Yeah, let it go.  Five or six months is not, I understand that it's hard, but you're going to be there for a while for work.  Why would she, think of it from her point of view, why would she want to be in a situation where she's dating somebody, she's not supposed to see other people, who's in Singapore? 
[03:38:30]  It's a hard situation, and you're better off.  Who needs that?  Five or six months, if it was meant to be, you'd still be home, or she would have come with you.  She's in the U.S., you're in Singapore.  Just meet somebody else or realize that this is not the time for this one, but let it go.  Yeah, man.  Let it go.  It's hard, but you're only going to make it harder by dragging it out.  You made your feelings known when you accepted that you were not going to leave your job and stay in the U.S. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah.  You took the move, and she made her feelings known when she said, look, I don't want to do this.  He got disconnected.  Oh, there you are.  Okay.  Yeah, PCM just kind of wants to email.  I'm like, because when she told me that she wanted to see me, kind of blindsided me.  I didn't feel like I got to say everything I wanted to do.  So PCM just kind of wants to email.  I just don't know if that, you know, kind of opens up the door.  Well, I mean, look, you could always, we're going to cut you, we're going to let you go, Nathan, because it's hard to hear your phone is dropping in and out. 
[03:39:30]  But, you know, we can hardly hear you.  But if you feel compelled to email someone and just tell them what's on your mind, you know, I guess that's not terrible.  If that's really what you want to do, but what is there to say?  Like, when you think about it, we always want to get the perfect thing in.  We always want to say the perfect thing.  It's like any, it's like any interaction, especially if it's a breakup or an argument.  You look back and you go, fuck, I should have said this.  Fuck, I should have said that. 
[03:40:00]  But you're never going to find the perfect thing to say.  So why not just accept the fact that no matter what you say, the situation is going to be what it is.  Because chances are you're doing this with a motive.  Chances are you want to email her with hopes of a response of some sort.  So if you really, in your fucking heart, say, I don't care if she reads this or responds, I'm getting it off my chest, then do it.  But really, really check your motives because you are probably hoping for a certain type of response or a certain result. 
[03:40:30]  And that's where you're going to get into trouble.  Let's see, who should we talk to?  How about, ooh, who do you think, Yurok?  Fucking Jeff.  Let's talk to Jeff.  Every guy's asking this question.  Jeff, every guy asks this question.  Jeff.  Jeffy.  Yeah, hey, Jimmy.  Hi, buddy.  What's on your mind?  Well, I don't have a problem with sex with my wife.  We have sex all the time. 
[03:41:00]  So I'm not one of those callers.  When we and my wife first got together, before we got married, blowjobs all the time.  It was awesome.  She'd take me all the way.  No complaints.  After we got married, they kind of slacked off a little bit.  Now let's see her every once in a while.  But she doesn't go all the way.  But she expects me to go around on her until she gets hers.  And then she just wants to fuck.  Which there's no problem there.  But when do I get, what should I do? 
[03:41:30]  Or what's my best recourse to get her to give me blowjobs and go all the way?  I asked her.  Quick, quick, let me interrupt you for one second.  When you typically just get a blowjob, is that in the middle of sex?  Or does she just suck your dick and let you cum?  Well, she'll, uh, we'll start off, you know, and then she'll, every once in a while,  just start giving me a blowjob until I cum.  And then she, when I cum, she, like, pulls her face away and all that shit.  It's like, what the fuck's up with that?  She used to just take it all.  Well, I don't know. 
[03:42:00]  Maybe your diet is changing.  Your fucking jizz doesn't taste as good.  Sometimes that, maybe you're drinking more coffee and your jizz tastes kind of icky.  Or, you know, that's a complaint most men have.  Their wife stops sucking the dick.  Part of it is when you get married, it's all about getting the fucking,  the fucking batch of seed into the womb.  That's when, you know, when they're young and reckless, they're like, oh, cum, yay!  They're tossing it out the fucking car window, like multiple Migs.  But then they get married and they want to fuck, they want that to be a fucking womb filler. 
[03:42:30]  That's what that's for.  Then all of a sudden, nature kicks in and they're like, my biology is going.  And that cum, I'm throwing out my offspring.  I'm drinking my offspring.  That's why they don't want to suck your dick as much, probably.  And maybe they get lazy, too.  You know, men get lazy with, we don't eat our wives' pussies as much or we don't do this or that.  But women get lazy, too.  They don't suck your dick as much.  They let themselves get fat.  They don't trim their pussy hair.  So I think one of the important things with any long-term relationship is you both have to stop.  Don't fucking get lazy.  And don't take it for granted. 
[03:43:00]  And I've done it, too.  So that's how I know.  I've been in that situation.  How do you get her two more?  Maybe while you're, eat her pussy a little bit.  But before she comes, kiss your way up to her nipples, tease her breasts a little bit, then kneel on the bed, lean over, kiss her, and then maybe put your cock up by her mouth, rub it or stroke it against her mouth, get her to suck your cock a little bit, and then stop.  Don't let her suck it till you come.  You stop, pull it out of her mouth, lean over and kiss her, and then go back to eating her pussy. 
[03:43:30]  Meaning, don't make it the be-all, end-all, so she won't always associate blowing you with a mouthful of your unpleasant jizz.  Maybe she'll do it more if during sex, you know, you play with it a little bit, and then you fuck her anyway.  I would suggest that.  Because I'm good at getting blown.  If you don't blow me, you're not going to be a part of the Norton team for very long.  That's on the application.  It's not that she doesn't blow me.  She doesn't blow down all the time.  Oh.  She doesn't take it all the way like she used to. 
[03:44:00]  Do you mean take it all the way?  Do you mean let you come in her mouth?  Yeah.  So she'll let you come still, but not in her mouth.  Exactly.  I mean, she, I asked, I cried out after one time.  I said, why don't you do that, take it all the way, and take the whole load like you used to?  She said, yeah, I just don't like the taste.  Okay, that's why, like I said, maybe your diet's changed.  Look at your diet.  Bring some pineapple juice.  Or, uh, there was that product they were selling here on the show.  So try that.  Try something that will make your cum taste better.  Call her bluff. 
[03:44:30]  Call her bluff.  Okay.  Good luck.  All right, thanks, Jimmy.  All right, Wade, who wants to get married to a girl who is of different religion.  Call number one.  Hi, Wade.  Oh, Wade, how are you?  Hey, man.  How you doing?  I'm good, buddy.  What religion are you?  Well, see, that's the thing.  She's a Southern Baptist, and I'm pretty much an atheist.  Okay.  I've kind of gone, she's a great girl.  We've dated all through college.  Sure.  I haven't exactly come out and said I'm an atheist to her yet, but I've kind of gone along with it. 
[03:45:00]  She's a good person.  She, you know, she's not diehard, but the problem is her parents are, you know, obviously Southern Baptists and, you know, parents, parents, grandparents, all that stuff.  And when marriage comes up, the thing that I'm, I don't know how far I want to take this or if I'm scared that if I say or come out to her that I am an atheist or I don't really, I guess religion is not the strong suit of my character, that it's going to change or it's going to be along with it. 
[03:45:30]  You know, and I've gone to church, whether part of this is my fault, I've gone to church, whether I've sat, I've been quiet, I've, you know, acted like I've closed my eyes during prayer and all that kind of stuff.  And we get along great, and that's the problem.  But you get along great.  Part of the reason is, sir, because you're in a play.  You're pretending to be somebody, maybe not in all aspects of the relationship, but this is obviously a big one.  If it's a big one to her, why don't you just be yourself?  And if you're afraid that she would leave you or not want to date you because you're not religious, do you really want to be in that situation? 
[03:46:00]  Well, see, I am myself.  I guess that's maybe the aha moment she might have is that I'm a good person.  I'm fine.  I don't do any drugs or drink, or I'm a good guy.  I just don't need religion for that.  You know, I don't need to suck up.  I don't know.  So why doesn't she know that?  How long have you been dating her?  Almost five years.  Okay, so you're being yourself in a lot of ways, but you are purposefully hiding a part of your belief system from her. 
[03:46:30]  Because you're afraid of how she's going to react.  I'm not saying you have to criticize hers.  I'm sorry.  No, no, that's okay.  I'm not saying you have to shit on hers.  But think of it this way.  You're probably an atheist.  You know she's religious.  You're willing to accept that.  So why wouldn't you think she'll give you that same courtesy?  And the thing is, I think she would be understanding. 
[03:47:00]  I think that would be fine.  And the other problem that comes into play is her parents are deeply religious, along with her grandparents.  Okay.  I'm scared when the marriage comes up that that's going to be a real big issue.  Well, maybe it will be, but maybe you should not worry about her parents because you're marrying her, not them.  And, again, I know the families come with it, and I know I sound ignorant saying that.  But I always feel that you and her are the ones that have to deal with each other.  You have to live together.  And if she's somebody you want to marry, she should be somebody who would defend her decision to marry the person she loves to her family. 
[03:47:30]  Tough shit about her parents and tough shit about her grandparents.  They're deeply religious.  So what?  Yeah, and I think another thing of it, too, is that a lot of the, I guess, the religions, and especially the Southern Baptists,  is they view, if you're an atheist, or if you're just, I don't even say an atheist, just not religious.  Yeah.  Or just don't find that.  They think that because you don't have God or that spirituality that you're inevitably, therefore, you're a bad person,  or you don't have anything to live for. 
[03:48:00]  There's not something to hold you accountable, and that's not, you know, I've run into my mind.  And I've thought about telling her, and I've thought about telling her, you know, two, three years into this,  but it's just kind of, it's just hard to do.  Well, I know, because you're afraid of her reaction.  But you're, think about what you're doing.  You are hiding a big piece of what you believe, because they're wrong to think that.  And I'm not even attacking the religion.  They're wrong to think that if you don't believe in God, look at Penn Jillette.  He's an atheist. 
[03:48:30]  He has a great life.  Right.  He explores science, and he loves being alive.  And so if you're willing to accept her religion and her belief system, and she's not willing to accept yours,  then you're going to have problems anyway when it comes to the kids, because she's going to find out, dude,  when she wants to go through this big religious thing.  How come you're not going to church with me anymore?  What do you want to put yourself through that shit?  It's crazy.  I would suggest being honest.  So do you think it could work out?  I mean, do you say, I mean.  Yeah, of course. 
[03:49:00]  Yes.  I think it could.  I just don't want her to resent her having some kind of contempt for me, or like I said,  when she wants to go to church, she wants to do something like that, and I don't.  Well, then maybe she should go by herself.  If the religion is that important to her in a marriage, then maybe as much as you care for her,  you're not the person to marry her if you're not willing to convert and become completely religious.  Again, I'm not going to speak to how she may react.  I don't know.  She may be fucking great about it, or she may dump you and go, I want to find a religious guy. 
[03:49:30]  But personally, if I was dating somebody who didn't have a meaty pussy, if I was dating a regular girl and religion was a big thing with her,  I heard it was a deal breaker, fucking adios.  Adios, because that's not what I want, and I'm not going to pretend.  I would wind up just arguing with her all the time about it anyway, and resenting her.  And then she wound up resenting me.  I think the biggest thing you can do is be dishonest.  All right.  Thanks, ma'am.  So good luck, my friend. 
[03:50:00]  And let's see here.  She'd go to Candace.  Women should get through first.  Oh, I didn't know Candace was here.  Hello, Candace.  Hi.  Hey.  Welcome.  I have a question.  I'm going through a divorce.  Actually, this is number two.  My first divorce, he got everything.  I walked away with just my clothes and my dog.  Did you have Anthony's lawyer?  Jesus.  No.  And I actually wound up paying salvo support.  Okay.  And I'm afraid it's going to happen again.  And so I don't know exactly what to walk away and let him, like, do I do it again? 
[03:50:30]  Do I just walk away with my dog and my clothes?  Well, hold on.  Do you make more?  What kind of job do you have?  And what kind of job does he have?  He doesn't.  He's not worked.  So do you find these guys who you support?  Are you like that?  Like, do you take care of these guys?  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, then the real problem is what you're looking for.  You're looking for guys who will depend on you.  Why?  Do you feel like you're not attractive?  No, I think it's just I've always been a caregiver. 
[03:51:00]  Like, that's my profession, even.  I'm a caregiver.  Was one of your parents a complete drunk or fuck-up?  Yes.  Okay.  Well, it's sometime.  Again, you could have just easily said no.  But that's the problem, is that you're looking for people to rescue and to save because it  makes you feel valid to take care of these people.  And then when it comes down to divorce, they have nothing, and you're the one that is the  breadwinner, so of course you're going to be in this situation.  Right.  I wouldn't just walk away and give him everything. 
[03:51:30]  Why isn't he working?  He was a disabled veteran.  He never went overseas, though.  So he can't say that's the problem.  But he's going to school, but he's been going to school for the last six years we've been  together, so...  Well, if you're not happy, and you know you're not happy, and you know it's not going to  work out, then you have to leave and, I guess, take your chances.  You don't have any kids together, right? 
[03:52:00]  No, we don't.  We have the two dogs that I came into the marriage with the two dogs.  But it's been more of, we've had, you know, separate bedrooms since we've been married.  I can count on one hand the number of times we've slept together since we've been married.  So do you think that he's using you just to take care of him?  In a lot of ways, yeah, I do now, looking back on it, absolutely.  So maybe, that to me, if you've only fucked a few times in all those years, that sounds 
[03:52:30]  like, what do they call, what kind of cruelty is that?  Extreme mental cruelty or something?  There's something for that, besides irreconcilable differences.  There's another reason.  Go to a divorce lawyer.  Just sit down, it doesn't cost anything to sit down and talk to somebody, I don't think.  Just go and talk to someone and say, this is my, you know, you're asking a guy who dropped  out of high school who has a fetish for fucking transgendered porn.  Go to a lawyer and ask a defense lawyer, or I'm sorry, a divorce lawyer.  Because they may be saying, no, no, no, here's the angle you take.  It's extreme mental cruelty or whatever it is.  Okay.  All right? 
[03:53:00]  All right, thank you.  Good luck.  And stop meeting these fucking bums.  Find a guy with a nice job who takes care of you back.  Oh, okay.  She's, let's go to, how about Nick?  We'll take a quick call at strip clubs.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hi, Nick.  Welcome.  I just got out of a real long-term relationship a few days ago, and I'm, like you, kind of afflicted  with sex addiction.  Sure.  But I've got no money.  And I'm just wondering, like, how I can get the most for the least at, like, a strip club, 
[03:53:30]  if you have any advice.  It's hard.  I don't go to them, to be honest, for that very reason.  They're experts, dude.  That's like saying, hey, listen, I'm going to sign this deal.  How do I go into this room full of lawyers and fuck them over?  That's a rough one.  You're not going to do anything that the stripper has not seen before.  You're not going to pull any moves that she doesn't know.  You can go in there and get a lap dance. 
[03:54:00]  Maybe try to come in your pants.  I would suggest that.  I've done that.  That's a win.  When you come in your pants in a strip club, my friend, you have won.  You're MVP.  If you can get a lap dance and blow a load in your pants, you leave victorious.  Aside from that, I would say just jerk off online because strip clubs get very, very expensive and very –  or just jerk off before you want to go to a strip club.  Jerk off, come all over yourself, and then go, now do I want to go.  Yeah.  It's an expensive habit, man, and usually 90% of the time it goes nowhere. 
[03:54:30]  It's just a bunch of empty promises and fake smiles.  It's a waste of money.  All right, good.  Thank you.  Good luck, buddy.  And who's Chad?  Oh, Chad!  Okay, this is – I hate to make this the last one because I've loved these calls today.  But Chad!  Hey, little Jimmy.  Hi, buddy.  I love your insight.  Thank you so much.  It's all opinion.  Listen, I've been married for over 20 years, have kids, and within the last year, my wife is pretty much disconnected, 
[03:55:00]  doesn't want any part of me, and a lot of it's because of stress, finances.  It's the same old stuff that causes divorce and everything.  Yes.  So I've been going through this for a year, sleep in separate rooms.  Wow.  We're cordial with each other, but that's it.  All right.  Now I've got this friend, this girl that's been a good friend who's also married, who wants me, wants me.  It's all about me.  She's probably in the same situation you're in, right? 
[03:55:30]  Well, not as bad.  She's enduring what she's going through.  She's not happy, obviously.  I found out in her marriage.  I didn't realize that.  But she pretty much came to me and said, I want to be with you.  I want somehow to make this work.  I don't see anything happening in my marriage now.  I could probably reconcile my wife, but she's cut me off lately for the last year.  I have remorse to her.  It's like now I don't want to be with her.  I don't know how to handle that versus this girl that wants to be with me who's also married. 
[03:56:00]  I don't want to wreck her life.  Yeah, but it's also you don't want her husband coming after you with a shotgun because every woman thinks her husband's a dope.  Oh, he doesn't read my text messages.  You know, and then he fucking reads it and he shows up at your house with a pistol.  I would suggest avoiding the other married woman because you're both going into it for what I would think would be the wrong reasons.  You're both people who are in shit situations looking at each other.  Hey, there's my salvation.  There's the thing that will make me feel better.  There's the fun, new, fresh thing to focus on. 
[03:56:30]  But if you're in a lousy marriage and you can get out of it, I would always suggest getting out of it.  If you've exhausted all avenues and you realize this is not what I want and she's obviously not happy, then, you know, you have a life to live.  You know, as long as you're not abandoning small children and being a piece of shit about it, maybe sometimes separating is the best move.  And then see how you feel about this girl.  Yeah, I mean, we're pretty much separated.  I'm still living in the house now.  I work on the road and I travel, but I live in the house with her.  And I have, you know, like I said, I have young children up to teenage. 
[03:57:00]  So it's tough, but it's tempting.  And I don't know.  I don't want to completely say, no, I'm not.  I don't want anything to do with this other woman.  But it's just complicated.  She's married and she doesn't she's not happy, but she's not ready.  You know, she wasn't ready to bail on this until I came into the picture.  Yeah, that's a disaster waiting to happen.  That's a disaster waiting to happen to marry. 
[03:57:30]  People can have an affair and sometimes it works out.  But if you are both single and freshly divorced, that's one thing.  You're both in it.  You're both in it.  That's a rough one.  One of you will absolutely get caught.  It could become a violent or very, very worst case scenario, unpleasant situation.  It could also just become a major problem, the divorce for either of you where you get fucked over because you've cheated.  It's just a nightmare waiting to happen, brother.  As tempting as it is, understand that part of it is because you're in a bad situation. 
[03:58:00]  So anything is going to look good compared to this.  All right.  Try to avoid it.  That's a nightmare waiting to happen.  All right.  And thank you, Jimmy.  Good luck, buddy.
