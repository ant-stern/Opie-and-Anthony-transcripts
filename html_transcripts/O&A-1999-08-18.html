<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with comedian Joe Piscopo as a guest.  Piscopo, claiming to be lost on his way to New Jersey,  entered the studio and reacted to the show's already-in-progress content, commenting on segments involving breast implants and a guest known only as "Buddy."  A significant portion of the show then centered on Vixen, a completely nude, petite woman from New Jersey, who was present in the studio.  The hosts and Piscopo engaged in discussions about Vixen's physique, her origins, and her unusual meeting with her husband at Chuck E. Cheese.  Vixen's nudity was a central feature, with conversations revolving around her participation in activities like nude hopscotch.  The hosts also joked about the possibility of putting Vixen on a local all-news station.  Later in the broadcast, the tone shifted considerably as Piscopo discussed his charitable work with at-risk children through his Positive Impact Foundation and an upcoming NBC television show.  This contrasted sharply with the earlier, raunchier segments featuring Vixen.  The show also included unidentified listeners who were given access to the studio at some point.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  1027 WNEW  Joe Piscopo, everyone.  Joe, what the hell are you doing in our studio?  I was on my way to Jersey. I took a wrong turn.  I said, where am I going? And I came in.  You know, I've been listening to you guys. It's so funny.  And I'm doing a news interview across the hall at WANS.  10-10 wins. All news.  Which they still use the teletype.  Yeah, yeah.  So I said, I've been listening to you guys.  You guys are sick, man. I'm telling you.  We try.  And then I come in and I'm here with my...  And I honestly listen to you. You know, I'm driving back from the city or somewhere. 
[00:00:30]  And I'm in the car and I go to Jersey.  Wait, wait. Prove that you listen to our show.  Because we get some people that say, hey, man, I listen to you guys.  And then we can't come up with anything.  I am embarrassed because usually I listen to INS or WCBS because I am an exciting guy.  And so now I listen to you guys and you start with the Buddy Epson thing.  Oh, yeah. Call him Buddy.  But you were kind to Buddy.  We love Buddy.  You were kind to Buddy. I'm telling you.  And then you did...  This one got me.  The breast implant thing where they blowed a breast implant in with the...  Oh, that was from the sex ball. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  You guys are... I'm tuning in.  We ran into it.  I'm looking for Scott Muni and I'm getting breast implants here.  Joe, help me out here.  I'm saying...  What did they do to my station?  And the lady goes.  And I'm on there. I'm listening.  And you got her to say...  And it was actually very interesting in a medical sense.  She had like a valve in her breast or something.  Yeah.  It was like a basketball under there.  The same thing.  She pumps it up with...  And he's high.  Yeah.  And he's high.  She goes home and she pumps him up.  I couldn't believe that.  It was at the point of ripping when we saw him.  It was disgusting.  As soon as...  It was either between the classical station or you guys. 
[00:01:30]  And I stayed with the breast implant thing.  Did you meet Vixen yet?  Hi, the nude woman.  How are you?  Very nice to see you.  Very nice to see you.  The New Jersey girl.  My wife is listening.  Yeah, she's from Jersey.  She's got her clothes on now.  Yeah, she's...  You're from Jersey?  I'm from Jersey.  Yeah.  Of course, Joe's from Jersey.  She's four foot six there, I saw.  It is.  And if I wrote this line, what exit is what...  Yeah, what exit are you from?  So let's see if I guess.  What exit are you from?  She doesn't drive.  I'm looking at you.  She doesn't drive.  She can't reach out.  I don't drive.  You can't drive from those child seats. 
[00:02:00]  See, Joe, while you were doing that boring interview at Wynn's,  we had Vixen, 4'6", 83 pounds, completely naked, playing nude hopscotch.  Ralph Howard said he's going to do that across the line.  Ralph Howard.  What do you think?  We're going to play...  Right after traffic and weather.  I'll be taking my clothes off.  Hey, can we do that?  I'm playing Twister.  Oh, my gosh.  There's condoms in front of me.  Oh, my gosh.  Those haven't been used, so...  I'm a nice Catholic battalion boy from Jersey.  Come on, now. 
[00:02:30]  I'm sorry I brought them.  You think it really has a kind of a gift?  That's very nice.  And her husband's standing there.  Joe and Vixen hitting it off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, Ann, we should bring Vixen up to 10-10s.  Oh, 10-10 wins.  In the middle of traffic and weather together.  Traffic and weather to...  Holy...  Oh, get on the floor.  Oh, you guys are so good.  Hey, is our husband smiling at Iowa?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, Logan loves this trap.  That's Logan.  Go ahead.  And how did they meet?  How did you guys meet, if I may ask?  At Chuck E. Cheese. 
[00:03:00]  No, you're serious.  Chuck E. Cheese.  You were entertaining the children, were you?  I see.  She was in that big thing with the little multicolored balls in it that they love to jump in so much.  But guys, you guys, you've got to tell me.  So listen to you, and you've got a good thing going.  How do you find a guest like this?  Because I was coming in the door out there trying to get in with no security guard or anything.  No, of course.  It was like no way around.  They're hoping something happens to us.  Because, you know, that the station management doesn't want to spend $5 an hour. 
[00:03:30]  Right.  So some guys wanted to come in.  They were standing.  Are they in here, those guys?  Are they over?  Yeah, we let them in.  It's like that.  Eh, why not?  They were like bribing me to get in there.  They got anything on you?  Nah, come on in.  Yeah, we let all our listeners in pretty much.  As long as you don't look too scary.  Oh, gosh, be careful.  Are they frightening?  No, actually, they're nice guys.  They're nice guys.  I was just saying, yeah, they're nice.  Oh, great guys.  But let me leave before they come in, okay?  What were you talking about?  If it wins.  No, no.  Where are you going to go?  You know what?  We're doing a television show.  And I know you guys are always having fun.  But seriously, I do a television show for at-risk kids. 
[00:04:00]  I was a bad kid.  I was such a bad kid, you know?  Yeah.  And I'm still bad because I listen to you guys, I guess.  But I tried to give back a little bit.  So we created a foundation called the Positive Impact Foundation.  And we created a show off of that called Positive Impact Television.  Half hour.  It's a half hour show for at-risk children.  All the good things that the kids are doing.  It'll be on NBC.  The NBC affiliate here on Labor Day weekend, actually.  Right.  So it's my, you know, I'm getting old, guys.  I got to give back a little bit, you know?  No, no, no.  That's cool.  Well, you know what?  These kids are so maligned.  And when you go to Camden, you go to Newark, you go to Jersey City or Patterson,  and no one gets a chance.  These kids virtually do not get a chance. 
[00:04:30]  And they're born into situations that they don't, they have no control over.  Half the ping pong, yeah.  Half the ping pong.  Hey, guys.  You ass.  You ass.  You ass.  We're just kidding.  You guys are so bad.  You're a comedian.  We're just kidding.  Come on.  Hey, listen.  I'll be laughing when you're all talking about a month.  That's right. </pre>
