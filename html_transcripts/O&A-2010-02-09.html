FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Let's do this. Good morning to everybody.  Got a lot going on in the New York area.  Should we go local today? Talk about the big snowstorm that's going to hit the East Coast?  Yeah, we're going to get some snow.  We missed the last one that just walloped.  They're using the word wallop.  Walloped.  That walloped Washington.  And Southern Jersey and Philly.  We missed it.  The best story about that snowstorm that hit Washington  A normal cab ride to Reagan International Airport would cost you $20 
[00:00:30]  because everyone is so desperate.  Because, you know, they can't get their cars out.  It's just still kind of a mess down there.  $100.  They're charging $100.  Gouging.  How do they do that?  Because they're friggin' savages.  Because they can't.  Oh, really?  Everyone does it.  Savages, white people, black people, purple people.  Everyone takes advantage of the situation. 
[00:01:00]  I should say savages.  Could be anyone of any color.  A white savage?  I just mean, yeah.  Cab drivers, gas station attendants.  You know, savages.  So wait, they charging $100.  That is against the law.  Is it?  Yeah.  I would think so.  I think so.  To gouge in crisis times?  Yeah.  It's a big, big story.  I don't know.  As they dig out.  And then some of these towns up here need help from the federal government because it might snow.  Because I think they got rid of their snow budgets. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That's one of the first things to go in a financial crisis.  What financial crisis?  Oh, my God.  What financial crisis?  Really?  Oh.  Or all the bullshit that's going on behind closed doors.  All the, I think it's all the corruption.  Well, thank you.  And redundancy in jobs and misappropriation of finances.  You know, business as usual.  Right.  We got whole states that are going bankrupt. 
[00:02:00]  How the, how you got the, like the transit authority here in New York City, in Long Island, and they're broke.  And every week or two weeks, they come up with a new we're broke figure.  Like, and this, meanwhile, is as they're cutting services, taxing the hell out of everyone.  People, like, don't even use mass transit.  They're taxing the hell out of them.  And then they come back and go, wow, you know what, we just found another $38 million that we're short. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, we didn't, we didn't realize, but actually the number's higher.  You did?  How about the guy in charge then?  How about the people in charge that are fucking up so badly that the TA is in such a grim shape?  Why don't you replace them?  Oh, really?  And see if someone could do a better job instead of cutting service and taxing everybody.  Who's going to replace that guy?  How about somebody that has been shown to be honorable and honest and a good businessman? 
[00:03:00]  How do you get that done?  With the unions in place?  You can't.  Well, they're...  You can't just throw those people out.  They're fucking lifers.  They're in there for life.  They have to have an inner revolution.  Yeah, well...  And that's never going to happen.  That ain't going to happen.  Man, it's ridiculous.  They all...  But it's like any job, any business.  The head, the top dogs, the company can just belly up and they're still there.  Look at Citadel. 
[00:03:30]  Look at Citadel.  Oh, yeah.  Look at Citadel Broadcasting.  Farid's still there, right?  I think so.  The company's fucking bankrupt.  Yeah, I lost 100 Gs.  Thank you, Farid.  So did I.  Thanks.  Over 100 Gs.  Thanks for that nice stock tip.  And now what?  He's still there.  He's still there.  Why don't they throw his ass out?  Matter of fact, you know, when we were on a bunch of Citadel stations...  Yeah.  I didn't know we were going down this road, but what the hell?  Shit, though.  We couldn't continue with Citadel because... 
[00:04:00]  Not because we weren't doing well for them.  No.  They couldn't afford us anymore.  And they were paying us shit.  And they were paying us shit to begin with.  So they couldn't afford us.  So they're like, look, we got to move on.  We're just going to pretty much just play music in mornings.  Just put a jock in there.  It's very cheap and easy.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And Farid continues to keep his job, even though the company went bankrupt.  I got a letter.  Did you get the Citadel letter in the mail?  About them filing for bankruptcy?  I shred all letters from Citadel.  It's like it's got debtors and this and filing this. 
[00:04:30]  And I'm just looking at it going, no, this is just a wash.  And there he is.  You know, there's the top dogs over there.  Still rocking and rolling.  Still drawing a check, I'm sure.  Still drawing a pretty hefty check.  I can name names, and I guarantee they're still there making their big salaries.  Guaranteed.  Hey, Shane is a cabbie in D.C.  Shane.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Thank you, Shane.  Just wanted to let you guys know, in the district, during a snow emergency, the cabs have the 
[00:05:00]  right to double the cost of a fare.  I don't know about that $100 cab ride to Washington National, though.  Why double the fare?  Is it a safety issue?  Like, they're driving in hazardous conditions?  It has something to do with the mayor and the cab commission here.  Oh, really?  How much is the mayor getting?  Yeah, right.  How much of that money is going to the mayor?  How much does it cost to take someone to the airport if it's not snowing?  Or just hang up after?  I guess it probably depends on where, but maybe they were normally a $30 cab fare. 
[00:05:30]  I think it was $20.  $20 to $100?  I think it was $20, and they boosted it to $100.  That's what I heard.  Let's go to Bill in Queens.  He works for the Transit Authority.  Oh.  Our department is like 300 people with 15 superintendents, superintendents, all making  $100,000.  Bill, what's up?  Oh, Bill.  Hey.  I haven't heard that before, boys.  Oh, you should listen more.  Hey, listen.  I work for a small department at the Transit Authority. 
[00:06:00]  We got about 300 people in my department.  Our superintendents, we have about 15 of them making over $100,000.  We have about 15 Level 2 supervisors that make about $95,000, and about 10 Level 1s making  about $80,000 a year.  It's insane.  It really is redundant and a complete waste of money that no one talks about.  No one brings this up when you hear stupid Bloomberg getting on, talking about how the 
[00:06:30]  Transit Authority is going broke and they got to start taxing people, taxing small businesses  based on, you know, their payroll.  That's what they do.  They take a small business.  They see what the payroll is.  And then they tax that and give it to the MTA, regardless of if anyone in that small business  even uses the Transit Authority.  It's fucking ludicrous.  And then they realize, well, that didn't generate enough money.  We still, oh, wow, we're still short. 
[00:07:00]  We fucked up in our calculations.  Absolutely.  And then they turn around.  They blame the employee, the everyday employee, minimum wage employee, saying that we take  all the money and this is the reason that they have to keep raising, which is...  Yeah, well, and then they cut back on service and they take some trains offline and they  fire some people.  But they all keep their fucking cushy $100,000 a year jobs to supervise. 
[00:07:30]  I don't even know why you need that many people to supervise 300 people.  You know what it is?  The rich get richer.  All right.  You know, it takes money to make money, Jim.  That's right.  Take it easy, guys.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Pat in Staten Island.  Pat.  Good evening.  Hey, Pat.  Yeah, I'm a bus driver on Staten Island.  So you know how to handle pressure because you bribe at dust.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thanks.  The thing is, nobody pays their fare when they get on.  You know, I don't have change. 
[00:08:00]  They ask people for a change of $100 bill.  And as far as kids getting on the bus, if their bus passes, if they're worried about losing  them, they don't use them anyway.  So it's, and the higher ups, management just says, just let them ride.  Just let them ride.  And that's the problem.  Punch it out.  All right.  Well.  One problem.  And the, as far as the cabs go in D.C., to answer your question, Jimmy, they don't  have meters.  They won that battle a while back.  So they don't have meters.  So it's all.  So you jump in the cab and it's all like, yeah, based on zones. 
[00:08:30]  And you don't know, you don't know the zones.  Yeah.  On the back of the cab, I remember they'll have like, you know, green, blue or whatever  where the section off is section one, two, three, and you could see how much it should  be, I think.  Especially for airport fares.  Or maybe it's just coming from the airport.  And then from that point on, I guess they could kind of, you know, hike their freaking,  their fee there.  Uh, let's say hi to Al in Brooklyn.  Al.  Al.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I'm another one of these guys that works for the transit authority. 
[00:09:00]  And, and I can tell you where they're saving money because I just got my certificate for  20 years of service in the mail.  And they used to give us this nice little appreciation dinner once a year for all the people with 20  and 25, 30 years of service.  And then after this nice letter praising it, all the work I've done, it says in the last  sentence that they no longer can hold the appreciation dinner due to budget constraints.  You've got to be kidding me. 
[00:09:30]  Thanks.  Thanks for your service, sir.  That's how bad it's gotten.  You've got to be kidding me.  It's the little guy that gets it, man.  All I want to do is get a paycheck.  And that other guy was saying?  Right.  All the big ligs, all these guys with this new line management program, they created more  management jobs than they had before.  And these are all guys that make over $100,000 a year.  You know what I say?  Too many cooks spoil the broth.  Yes, that's what I say. 
[00:10:00]  All right, Al.  Hang in there.  He's punching out.  They actually made more management jobs.  That's unbelievable.  Management is the bane of existence of businesses.  And then it looks like, I guess this leads to the governor of New York.  We're going to lose another one?  We only had this guy for a little while.  He insists he is not resigning.  He might get pushed out, though.  They're false rumors.  They're false rumors.  Governor Patterson is denying, what, sex with broads and drug use and all sorts of stuff. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, yeah.  We were better off with Spitzer, it's starting to look like.  Well, maybe.  Who knows?  We'll see how this plays out.  But the governor, you know, a lot of distractions up there in Albany.  A lot of distractions.  I guess a New York Times article is going to be coming out about his shenanigans, if I  might call them shenanigans, and supposedly, I'm not sure, I haven't read the story, but  supposedly people are speculating that they're full of little sexual indiscretions and drug 
[00:11:00]  use, which will throw him right the fuck out of that office.  And who's next in line?  Jesus Christ.  I think we are.  I think somebody in here is next in line.  We'll be the next governor.  Spitzer.  Of New York.  Just all of the New York state governors just tripping over their cocks on the way  to success.  Just put Spitzer back in there.  I agree. 
[00:11:30]  Wow.  When are we going to stop?  It's like, governors are crazy.  There's always a problem.  I know.  Bukoyevich in Chicago is nuts.  Fucking, uh, what is that?  Our Jersey boy.  McGreevey.  McGreevey.  So many of these guys.  Yeah, I don't get it.  You're right.  It's just, you know.  You said so many of these guys, you named two.  No, but there's been other scandals, too, though.  There's been so many that have just been.  Mark Stanford.  Mark Stanford.  Very good.  And this was all recently.  His son. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, that's not what I mean, you big dummy.  But you are right.  I did act like there was a list of 40.  I named two.  All right.  Someone's going to explain the, uh, I guess, I guess we're not trying to attack the Cavs  in D.C., by the way.  It sounds like a lot of you guys listen to the show.  Tom, what's going on?  Oh, not much.  How you doing, fellas?  All right, brother.  Um, you know, if somebody's taking a cab for a ride to the airport and under normal conditions,  it would take a half an hour. 
[00:12:30]  But because of the snowstorm, it's going to take an hour and a half.  I think that cabbie needs to make a little more money on that ride.  Yeah, I agree with that.  Otherwise, at the end of the day, it's over.  And that whole zone cab thing, in the high crime areas, what the zone cab system does  is it allows you to tell the person when they get into the car how much it's going to be.  That way, that's your request to get paid.  So when you get to the destination, they don't just skip off or, as I've heard they do sometimes,  just open up their coat and show you the gun and the waistband while they're walking away. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, that's nice.  That's pleasant.  Have you had that happen to you?  No, I haven't had it happen to me in Colorado.  But, you know, I've talked to cabbies that work in New York, D.C., Philadelphia.  Yeah, man, it's fucked up.  We deal with some assholes out here.  Unbelievable.  Man, New York's on a meter system, though, so it's kind of hard to pay in advance.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, and the New York cab drivers get screwed that way a lot.  And they got that bulletproof glass thing and the metal on the back of their seats. 
[00:13:30]  I like when you see the crazy white cab driver that doesn't have that.  No.  No, he's wearing a party hat with American flags on it and a fucking spinny propeller hat.  You know, it's the life of the party waiting to be shot in the back of their head.  Yeah, we got a few of those.  Yeah, we got a few of those.  Insane tens.  Yeah, well, you got the bulletproof glass, but if the guy doesn't want to pay you and you got to get out and engage with him,  if you want to get your money, you know, what are you going to do?  Nothing.  Right on.  Nothing. 
[00:14:00]  It's a loss.  Exactly.  All right, brother.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  All right, let's go to Stryker.  Stryker?  Stryker.  Hey, I'm sure Jimmy knows this, and people out here in Colorado know this.  Our airport is a long ways from downtown Denver, and a cab ride used to be 40.  It just went up to 50, and now they're talking it's going to go up again from Denver to the airport.  And, yeah, our governor should be included in the list of crappy governors.  He's resigning, or he's not going to run for re-election, and there's a chance that his next term could be a very long term in prison. 
[00:14:30]  Him and a bunch of his cronies are going to probably fix the investigation.  You know what, I don't think you're supposed to go from a high political office, and then your next job is jail.  I mean, call me crazy, but something seems broke out there.  Yeah, well, he...  Why is he going to jail?  Well...  Possibly.  There was a...  During his campaign, his last campaign, he claimed he was tough on illegal immigration, 
[00:15:00]  and an Immigration and Customs agent brought to his opponent the fact that this guy was plea bargaining felonies for, you know,  illegal immigrants who were accused of felony.  He was plea bargaining down to a misdemeanor and letting them off when they should have been deported.  And once this guy got into office, this Immigration agent got fired, and now as the scandal has come out, 
[00:15:30]  there's been all kinds of lies told.  In fact, the U.S. attorney that was nominated by this guy here in Colorado,  she was recently forced to withdraw her nomination because if it had come out in the hearings before Congress,  that it could have probably... the scandal could have probably reached even higher yet.  So he just kind of had to withdraw, and now they're talking that there's some, you know,  behind-the-scenes calls for the governor and a bunch of his cronies to face federal indictments. 
[00:16:00]  Tapping out.  Yeah.  I'm tapping...  I think you went too deep for this.  I'm tapping, yeah.  He went a little deep.  I'm sure that would be an amazing phone call to, like, you know, a real talk show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Where they talk about all that stuff.  And then the host would have, like, facts and figures on the guy, and then I'd...  Oh, but his testimony, I do recall, it was very important that he...  I hung in there for a long time on that one show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:16:30]  And then nothing against Stryker.  It was a very fine...  Was that Stryker?  I was reading.  I just heard...  Yeah, yeah.  Dude, I perused the Ellen article in the post.  Yeah.  Sorry, Stryker.  The Ellen article.  It's about her, you know, American Idol.  Oh, yeah.  I guess she debuts tonight.  Yeah.  We're going to see a very nice Ellen.  And, boy, have there been sparks between her and Simon, from what I hear.  And she announced that Simon is indeed a mean guy.  Yeah, wow.  That came out today.  Wow, I'm sure that's all legit. 
[00:17:00]  Breaking news.  Simon Cowell is actually a mean guy.  Yeah, yeah.  That fucking American Idol.  Like, they didn't plant all those stories about how Ellen...  Did you hear the one where Ellen got there early?  Like, she's got to be there at a certain time, because she has her show to do and everything,  so she agreed to do this.  But, you know, there's got to be certain time constraints and things.  And she got there, and then Simon decided to show up late, pulls up in his limo late, 
[00:17:30]  and she just unloaded.  Like, I'm here at a certain time, and...  Get the fuck out of here.  She's not doing that.  I know.  I read it, and all I'm thinking is, what fucking Ricky Ricardo publicity agent shit is this  to try to get some heat between these two?  I mean, half these stories are just made-up stories that the media just, you know, attaches  themselves to and runs with.  The Howard Stern going to American Idol story?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm not even going to beat up Howard about that. 
[00:18:00]  It's a made-up story.  The whole fucking thing is a made-up story.  It's a negotiating ploy.  Whether Howard's people floated it to, you know, I know he's got buddies over there at  the Post, whatever, however it got done.  But then the media takes it like it's a real story, and instead of doing some real investigating,  if they did some real investigating, they would realize it's a made-up story, and it doesn't  mean shit.  They just say it like it's fact.  That's why it's like anything that's written on a blog, the news will pick it up and just  talk about it like it's news. 
[00:18:30]  I mean, while it's some, you know, asshole in his house just typing his opinions.  But the Ellen story, I mean, you can, you know, really, Ellen DeGeneres is going to  yell at Simon the first day, or as soon as she sees Simon, she's not going to have  nothing but really, for real pleasantries, not how we say pleasantries.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, sure.  They probably, you know, did the, well, she's kind of a man, so she probably did like the  handshake, handshake half a hug thing that guys do.  She probably did that with Simon, and it was all just nothing but happy times for everybody. 
[00:19:00]  They were probably laughing with each other at the urinal.  Now they're saying 12 to 15 inches in New York.  They just moved the forecast.  What?  Since we started broadcasting, they just upped it another six inches.  It was nine, and now it's 12 to 15.  Oh, boy.  So we're going to get walloped here in New York City.  Hopefully we'll be able to handle it.  Whoa, what's the sand and salt budget?  Did they cut it?  Are we going to be talking to plow drivers? 
[00:19:30]  That's so ridiculous.  It really is ridiculous what's going on out there.  I mean, I smell a revolution coming.  I really do.  Oh, please.  But Sarah Palin and her writing her shit on her hand isn't going to get the job done.  The notes on her hand?  I mean, I know you're not an Obama guy, but she went after Obama for doing a little reading  off the teleprompt.  Or prompter.  How do the fuck you say that?  Teleprompter.  Prompter.  And there she's got notes on her hand like she's in freaking high school.  Cheating on a test. 
[00:20:00]  Huh?  That's cute.  Writes the little notes on her hand.  Well, that's another one the media, you know, sucks up to.  She's an idiot.  They're all wondering if she's going to make a run for the presidency.  Sarah Palin does not have a chance in hell to be the president of the United States of  America when it comes right down to it.  She wouldn't make it through the primaries.  Not even a killer, though.  Not even a chance.  But they take it seriously.  Like, you know, there's a potential that she could actually be the president.  There's no fucking way.  I don't even think she'd give the nomination.  I don't think she'd run. 
[00:20:30]  I think she's smart.  She saw that she was the governor of Alaska.  And, you know, it's like this is an opportunity.  She's probably getting paid a lot of money at Fox.  And she left the governor.  They would kill her for that in the campaign.  Like, why did you walk away from your governor job to become an analyst?  I think that was the end of any political career.  And there's another governor that's had some strange things going on.  And all of a sudden just quits her job.  I just can't take the way she talks.  She stands up there at the podium and talks about things.  You know, I'm just a mom. 
[00:21:00]  How's that change working out for you?  Working out for you.  Kind of a good line.  But when you hear it, such a sweet lady.  When you hear it with that accent, it's a little rough.  I know.  A little rough.  I don't think she would be a good president or vice president.  But I do think they gave her a tremendous beating beyond where they needed to give her a beating.  Just because she's like an attractive, really conservative woman, too.  She made it easy.  She actually didn't make their jobs hardier.  She made it really easy for them. 
[00:21:30]  And there was just such dissension in the ranks of the Republican Party that, you know, they didn't like her.  She didn't like them.  McCain didn't like her.  It was just a disaster.  Anyway, it was a gag ticket having her on there.  I've theorized.  Do you think that Obama, because they knew that Bush was so persona non grata, that they knew that Obama was almost unbeatable?  A shoo-in.  And McCain, it was his turn to run, but he's an older guy. 
[00:22:00]  It was the only time he couldn't run when he was 76.  Yeah.  I wonder if they kind of threw her to the wolves, like, we don't want to give up one of our young or one of the brighter, younger Republicans.  Yeah, that has a chance.  Get somebody else who won't be tainted by a loss.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Weldon in Jersey.  Weldon.  Weldon.  That's your name or your job?  Yeah.  What are you doing?  I'm Weldon.  My name.  Hey.  I've read her book.  And actually, you know, they really screwed her in the fact that they threw her under the bus. 
[00:22:30]  The people in her campaign was a friggin' real estate agent, not a real estate agent, a stockbroker.  I mean, they didn't make very good decisions for her.  You have to admit, though, the Katie Couric interview, which Sarah has admitted she thought was going to be,  or someone has said who knew her that she thought Katie was a fan and would treat her better.  Yeah, be a fluff piece.  That said, she still should have been much better prepared to answer those questions. 
[00:23:00]  Okay, can I ask you a question?  Sure.  You guys are intelligent.  You guys deal with the media.  And these people, you know, you've never been in the spotlight.  You're in Alaska, okay?  The biggest news thing in nothing.  And this lady comes up to you and just starts frustrating the hell out of you.  Let me ask you something, though.  You know what?  If someone asks, what newspapers do you read, what magazines or newspapers do you read, you should just have an answer.  It should just be in your fucking head.  Oh, come on. 
[00:23:30]  And that tripped her up.  What do you mean, oh, come on?  What do you mean, oh, come on?  That is a famous faux pas on her part.  My God.  Yeah, but that's after three hours of asking the same question over and over again.  She should be able to take it.  If she's going to be vice president, I think maybe she should be able to take some questioning, Henry.  And if she's doing interviews all day long, she's going to be very aware that she's got Katie Couric coming at her.  And if she wasn't an intelligent woman, she'd be prepared for that.  Listen, the first time you guys are on the media, did you guys screw up? 
[00:24:00]  What's that?  Oh, my God, yeah.  Very badly.  Okay.  But we weren't the governor.  It wasn't our first time at the rodeo, boys.  Dude, she's the governor of a state, and she wanted to be the vice president of the country.  If you can't handle some media...  I'm not saying that she got an answer wrong, she should be crucified.  But when you handle an interview with Katie Couric that bad and a few other things, that's not a good sign.  What about when Biden screwed up and said the TV and the other thing, and they didn't say a word about that? 
[00:24:30]  I know.  She screwed up, too.  So, I mean...  How about we just deal with the latest one where she's got notes on her hand?  We're looking at the picture online.  Come on, are you honestly saying you think that she was a good candidate?  Come on, man.  I mean, why did you...  Dude, she'd be the best president to take this country back from the liberals.  Back from the liberals. 
[00:25:00]  Guns for everybody.  Guns for everybody.  That's just a...  Back from the liberals.  Who was president for eight years before Obama?  What are you talking about?  Okay, but, you know...  Okay, he made a lot of mistakes, okay?  He was the gnat.  I'm not even knocking Bush.  I'm only saying, you act like the liberals have had the country.  It's like, it's been a year.  Stop acting like we've been in this liberal cesspool for ten years. 
[00:25:30]  Bush had the country for eight years.  Oh, yeah.  Well, he wasn't really a Republican.  I mean, he spent more money...  George Bush Jr. isn't a Republican?  Wasn't really a Republican.  You know what, dude?  Wasn't really a Republican.  Are you just trying to...  He knows he's a Republican, but he wasn't really a Republican.  Are you talking about McCain?  Are you just trying to mouth what you heard Rush Limbaugh saying?  No, I don't listen to Rush Limbaugh.  I listen to...  Back in...  All right, good.  So, wait.  George Bush...  George W. Bush... 
[00:26:00]  As conservative as he was...  He's not a real Republican.  He wasn't conservative in money.  He wasn't a conservative in other things.  He wasn't a real conservative.  He played conservative...  Christian right.  ...but he spent too much money.  Wow.  Yeah, you're right.  He was a real liberal, that pro-life Bush.  A real liberal.  No, you're right.  You're right.  He performed abortions in the Oval Office.  No, you're right.  He is absolutely a very, very liberal Republican.  McCain, they said, was a liberal Republican. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  But to say that Bush isn't...  You're just a fool.  Or your idea of a Republican is just...  You think that Sarah Palin is a real Republican, but Bush wasn't.  Yes, she is a real Republican.  She's...  I know your beliefs in religion, and I don't know why, but I am...  This guy's in love.  ...a hardcore religion, like reading the Bible, is different than all these Bible thumpers and people that go on.  Okay?  There's a big difference.  So she's not a... 
[00:27:00]  Hold on.  I don't understand what you mean.  How can you say that Bush is not a real Republican, and she is?  Because she more of the value.  She actually went against her party and went against those big oil companies and got oil piping in Alaska, which they couldn't do for 20 years.  So you're saying the Republicans didn't want oil piping in Alaska?  No, they didn't.  They sat on the deal.  They wouldn't allow it.  Now, why is that?  It had anything to do with the fact that we have deals with Saudi Arabia, and they're protecting that, which is disgusting? 
[00:27:30]  I don't know.  And McCain wanted...  Didn't McCain want to drill in Alaska?  Drill.  McCain wanted to drill in Alaska, so I guess he's a real Republican and Bush isn't.  I don't know.  Just for drilling.  Driller.  You know, he drills in Texas.  I don't know.  I just...  I don't know.  Dude, I'm not knocking your opinion.  You like Sarah Palin.  That's fine.  All right.  But to say that she would grab the country back from the grasp of the liberals, what are you doing, dude?  Just admit that you love the woman.  The country's being grabbed back by the liberals in November. 
[00:28:00]  It's going to be grabbed right the fuck back.  Obama's going to be sitting there going, I can't do shit now.  Believe me.  Oh, I can't.  Dude, we weren't in great shape.  Oh, is he kidding?  No, he's not.  We weren't in great shape before Obama got here.  I hate that...  It's not even a shit on Bush, but we weren't.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Tony, Wisconsin.  Tony!  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Happy birthday, Jerry.  Hi, Tony.  Hey, man.  Hey, uh...  Uh...  Sorry, let me...  Um... 
[00:28:30]  Hey, have you seen this new HR-45 bill?  What's that?  It's, uh...  Apparently, on the, uh...  On your taxes...  Yeah.  You have to register every gun that you have.  It's a rumor.  It's fake.  That's not real.  If you go to the NRA website, you'll see that they'll...  I think right on the front page, it says it's fake.  And if you go to, uh, Snopes, uh, you'll see that that whole thing is fake.  You...  They're not doing that.  And, uh, maybe I should stop sending that email around to all the guys that were... 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, exactly.  I've gotten that email quite a few times.  It's, uh...  It's not...  It's a...  It's a rumor.  It's fake.  You would go broke, Anthony.  Yeah, I know.  You would go broke, if that was true.  Exactly.  Thank you, Tony.  All right.  And then, finally, in New Orleans, what, uh...  Negan's out.  Yeah, yeah.  I guess that wraps up our little political discussion.  We didn't even know we were really going down this road, but...  Well, he, uh...  Voted out?  Well, term limits.  Term limits, and now, uh...  But his approval rating was at 20%.  Um, so now they're going to have the first white, uh, uh, mayor of New Orleans in, I think 
[00:29:30]  something like 40 years?  Is there...  Is it over 40 years?  Um, which, uh, pretty amazing.  Pretty amazing.  As a matter of fact, the last white mayor of New Orleans was the father of this guy.  Oh, wow.  That is the, yeah, candidate to...  No kidding.  The former mayor.  Yeah.  So, uh, we'll, we'll see how, how that works out in New Orleans, because now New Orleans  ain't, uh, chocolate.  Well, no...  Chocolate, like Negan said. 
[00:30:00]  Right.  Well, now that they won the Super Bowl, but that place is fine, so...  You think it's fine now?  Yeah, there's no worries down there anymore.  Well, they sure know how to celebrate.  We finally could just...  We finally could move on from Katrina, because they won the Super Bowl, so everything's good  down there.  Everything's good.  Everything's good.  Everything...  Whoa, hey, whoa!  Hey, let's, let's celebrate.  New Orleans style.  Three people shot during Super Bowl celebrations?  Yeah.  That's only three people.  That's not bad.  That's not too bad at all.  If a team wins for the first time in 40-some-odd years, that's not bad.  I thought, I thought the total would be higher.  Yeah. 
[00:30:30]  I mean, unless it's St. Louis winning a championship, someone has to die.  Yeah.  Name another city where someone doesn't die or get shot after, after their team wins.  Even Boston, a girl got in the eye with a beanbag.  What do you mean even Boston?  Boston is pretty rowdy.  Well, a beanbag bullet.  They just do it differently, that's all.  Yeah.  But every, every, uh, city suffers a few injuries after the, the team wins the big game.  The big game.  I wonder how the, uh, I wonder how they're dealing with that in New Orleans.  Like, I haven't really seen anything about, uh, those, those houses that were just in the 
[00:31:00]  middle of, like, a lake and mud and stuff.  They just plow those over and never rebuild or rebuild, like, nice houses to keep the impoverished  people in Houston or wherever the, until they had to go.  Have you seen any, uh, recent footage that that's, stuff is just sitting there rotting?  Yeah, that's, that's what I thought.  I, I, I didn't think they're doing anything with it.  They can't get to all that stuff.  So, all those people are still, like, I guess.  They just kind of moved to, to Houston.  Families, friends, homeless, and stuff. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, look, a kitten.  Moving to other cities.  Um, the kitten's looking for some, uh, something to drink.  And the cat's not bad either.  Brr, brr, brr, brr.  Um, yeah, no, it's a, it's still a mess five years later.  Yeah, but you know what, I'm just wondering if, you know, instead of rebuilding these shitty  houses, if they just leave it, hopefully the population stays down, uh, because that's  always, that's kind of a good thing. 
[00:32:00]  It means more jobs and things like that when you get, keep the riffraff out.  But, I don't know.  See, uh, that's something I'm...  So, you're all for keeping the riffraff out.  Riffraff out is always good.  Not good for the cities they went to, by the way, because the crime rate shot the fuck  up.  Yeah, but it was spread out.  Uh, yeah, yeah.  Well, Houston took it.  Well, Houston took it out a little bit.  Houston took a hit, but...  Yeah, they took a little bit of a hit.  But there were a lot of other areas that, uh, took in the, uh, the people.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I'm just wondering how, how that it's working out.  Like, are they rebuilding?  Are they, what are they doing there? 
[00:32:30]  They're slowly rebuilding, and economically, yeah, you're probably right.  From an economic standpoint, it's probably really good for the city that not everyone  came back to New Orleans.  Like, aside from Mardi Gras and the tourism that Mardi Gras brings in, New Orleans, and  I guess being a port city, they make some money, uh, for that.  But, I mean, they, they, it really is just a pile of shit, uh, cities.  Jesus!  How do you know it is?  I've been there.  You've been down Bourbon Street a couple times. 
[00:33:00]  It is a, a, I've been off Bourbon Street, my friend.  Where'd you go off Bourbon Street when you were down there?  Oh, took a little walk around looking for a casino.  Oh, did you?  Yeah, certainly did.  Holy mother of Christ.  A little scary?  Woo, a little scary.  But if you have a, a city that has a lot of tall buildings, they're doing something right.  That's how I look at it.  Yeah, it's just like the city center.  When you, when you go around the country and you see some of these cities and the buildings  aren't that tall, it's obvious, okay.  Not good?  They're not getting as much done as in Boston and New York or Washington. 
[00:33:30]  I think it's more important, though, to look at the outskirts, too, the immediate areas  of, uh, uh, those big buildings and see what's going on there.  I bet you you barely went.  If it's nice suburbia, you went barely a mile from Bourbon Street.  You're probably right.  But I'll tell you, I don't think I have to walk too far to know that New Orleans, aside  from Mardi Gras and, and some shipping, is just a pile of shit that really has no redeeming 
[00:34:00]  value except for their sexual deviancy during Mardi Gras and, uh, pumping in some, uh, oil  and, uh, resources for the rest of the country.  I would suggest you don't, you might not have enough info on that to make that statement.  Uh, what do I, you know what I have?  What?  The microphone.  A microphone in front of my face.  Uh, Daryl, Louisiana, you're listening to Anthony.  What do you got on that?  Good evening.  Hey, man.  This is actually, this is actually Anthony's friendly 511 rep.  Oh, how you doing, Daryl? 
[00:34:30]  I'm pretty good.  Uh, hey, um, as far as, uh, building in New Orleans, um, as far as, like, Ninth Ward and  all that stuff, most of those areas, they won't even allow them.  They, they, they haven't issued the permits, the grid's still off, um, so they, they haven't  decided what the hell they're going to do.  So, right now, you just drive by, you can still see all the FEMA trailers and all that  other stuff, but for the most part, they're not even allowing it.  That's the big stink about all the help and all that they're, um. 
[00:35:00]  That's going to be like Pompeii, where in years to come, they're just going to find,  like, in, in archeological dig, these rotted, uh, houses that are just going to be sunk  into the landscape.  Some hot currents and some Jennings and some good throwdown guns and all that other stuff.  Yeah.  You know what, I guess, you know what, I, I think Anthony's making a pretty good statement  this morning as far as, uh, rebuilding.  Why would you, as a city, yeah, rebuild these really, really poor, horrible areas?  That could just flood again, by the way, because they haven't fixed the levee situation. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  It could very easily happen again.  So why would you go in there and rebuild all that, uh, using up your, your resources?  And invite back, uh, uh, people that, you know, uh, not, not the best of, uh, people, uh,  that are, that are, we're living in some of those areas, the most productive.  Well, if you look at what's happened after Katrina and the murders and all that other  stuff, 90, probably 95, if you look at it on map, 95% is isolated to the ghetto. 
[00:36:00]  Um, and Anthony talking about Bourbon street, not having to go, go far to basically get in  the ghetto.  So the Northern, I can't remember.  Anyway, the top of the French border is Rampart street.  If you cross over that street, you're in the project.  See, and I remember Rampart street.  You're lucky you didn't get, you're lucky you didn't get.  Cause I remembered it because, uh, Rampart was from emergency, the TV show.  And I was like, Oh, okay.  Rampart.  Is that, was that one of the main roads?  Like it was a lot of action, not one of those tiny little side roads, this Rampart. 
[00:36:30]  I'm trying to remember.  It's a, it was a, uh, canal street is the one they showed all during the, uh, the footage  of Katrina with the palm trees on them.  That's the Nallon Rampart in a box.  And I can't remember the other end, uh, of the French border.  And then you have the river with St.  Peter's indicator on the other side.  All right.  But anyway, thank you.  That's all I got.  No, that's good, Daryl.  Thank you.  Let's go to Danny in New Orleans, who's very offended.  Uh, Danny. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, I am extremely offended at Anthony's remarks.  Why?  Because with a, uh, one or a two day visit, you hit it right on the fucking head.  Jesus.  It is, at, Orleans Parish is basically a shithole.  So where does all that, where does all that money go that, that they bring in from Mardi  Gras?  Is there more corruption?  It seems like that, it seems like that money would, you know, if it was, uh, taken care  of properly, it would be spread out nicely for the city. 
[00:37:30]  No, it's spread nicely into the politician's pocket.  There's so many blue ribbon, uh, committees put together to study so much shit.  You could, uh, you could tie a ribbon from here to the fucking moon.  Yeah, a lot of, uh, a lot of corruption.  And, uh, boy, the police department was called out, uh, during Katrina too, as, uh, just being  an amazingly corrupt and criminal, uh, organization.  Well, the, the police department, I mean, is for, for as much shit as they take, they're  actually probably the best crowd control, uh, police department. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Oh, I've seen them at work with, with the horses.  I just say, when you see, when you see some, when you see a cop looting one of the stores  during, uh, during, uh, the hurricane, that was a little odd.  Why is that odd?  That was a little odd.  That was, that was, that was, uh, meter maid.  Oh, was it?  Uh, as a human being, that would be a tough thing not to do if you're in that situation.  Well, if you're supposed to be some type of law enforcement.  I understand that you're not supposed to.  Yeah, I gotcha, meter maid.  I don't like this show.  Yeah, there's, there's a, there's a difference between, uh, survival mode and walking out 
[00:38:30]  with 30 pairs of Reeboks on your shoulders.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I hear you.  Yeah.  I hear you.  All right, Danny, thank you.  I think, uh, survival mode entailed, um, smart people that knew what they needed and grabbed  a bucket of Heineken.  Sure.  And walked through a river in order to have that Heineken.  That wasn't a river.  Most famous, most famous looter ever.  That's a great shot.  Why don't we take our first break here? 
[00:39:00]  Uh, do we have Roy Jones Jr. coming in today?  Yes, we do.  That's pretty damn cool, huh?  That's great.  He's been fighting for a while.  I've, I've been, uh, getting my knowledge from Jimmy about this Roy, uh, Jones Jr.  He's a tremendous, tremendous, a little older now, but I mean, so is Hopkins who he's fighting.  I don't know exactly when the fight is.  April 3rd.  April 3rd.  You know what's just great about that looter picture?  There's one in his back pocket.  Like, he, he just needed one more.  Like, I need one more.  I guarantee he had one of the bottle on top of the other bottles and it kept slipping off. 
[00:39:30]  So he said, fuck it, I'll put it in my pocket.  Why doesn't Heineken use that in their ads?  They should get this guy, sign him to an endorsement deal.  Tells you that beer must be real good.  Yeah.  I drink pretty good.  All hell's breaking loose and he's got to get his Heineken.  That would make it great.  See, see, this is the type of ad that would get the country talking as far as Super Bowl ads go.  You do that.  Instead of this horse shit that we saw a couple days ago.  Could you imagine if they had looter guy at the Super Bowl walking around with a Heineken thing? 
[00:40:00]  I mean, it would be huge.  That's real, that's real edge.  Oh, that's edgy advertising.  That's ignoring political correctness and that's the type of ads that gets America talking.  And then just have like a little slug line like, some people know priorities.  There you go.  Yeah, yeah.  The outrage would be great.  Oh.  But people wouldn't stop drinking their beer.  No, of course not.  Stop.  All right, quick break and we'll talk about Super Bowl.  They're saying maybe most watched TV show ever. 
[00:40:30]  I don't buy it.  I don't buy it either.  I don't buy it.  Stay there, Opie and Anthony.  No.  Yeah, let's go.  We're about, we're ready to broadcast again.  Takes forever to come back from break.  I know.  I want to comment about that Rivera clip.  Yeah.  But now that's like three minutes ago.  After all the promos that we run after that clip.  Opie and Anthony, good morning to everybody.  I got to tell Anthony, on his recommendation, I went, I didn't go and see, it was on my TV.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:41:00]  On demand now.  I went and watched Hurt Locker.  Yes.  Or The Hurt Locker, I guess, right?  One of my favorite movies of the year so far.  I really, really enjoyed The Hurt Locker.  Yep.  What a great movie.  What a simple movie.  Yeah, yeah.  It's nothing really too complex about it.  It's just a guy, you know, over there in Iraq, taking care of some explosives.  Where do they film that?  It's a little crazy. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Where do they film the movie?  All right.  Because when you see those type of war movies, you're like, all right, obviously they're not  in Baghdad filming a movie.  Yeah, true.  So they got to kind of find an area that looks like the area they want to kind of represent.  There's a lot of desert between Vegas and L.A.  I'm sure they found, yeah.  I don't know.  They filmed some locals and stuff.  I don't know.  They were somewhere.  Maybe they were in some.  I'm going to go with, let's guess.  I'm going to go Morocco.  It seems like Morocco is like a safe place to film. 
[00:42:00]  And it sort of looks like what's going on over there.  Turkey.  You're going to go with Turkey?  I'm going to go with Turkey.  Moscow.  I say Moscow.  It was filmed in Jordan.  Jordan.  And Kuwait.  Oh, Kuwait.  Oh, we forgot about Kuwait.  All right.  We bailed those fuckers out.  They better let us film a movie over there.  Yeah, but the main guy in the Hurt Locker, yeah, he was, wow.  Yeah, a little wild.  But like they say at the beginning of the movie, war is a drug.  Yeah.  And he was addicted to war. 
[00:42:30]  He was addicted to war, to what he did, to being the camaraderie, the...  The, you know, excitement, the thrill of everything.  Now, what pisses me off, once again, they were showing a clip from the Hurt Locker on the news.  Local news wants to fucking again.  And the scene where...  And I'm not giving away, because we've all seen it.  Yeah, yeah.  And if you haven't seen the movie, you want to turn it out for a few seconds, I understand.  But when he's following that wire...  Oh, it's great.  So he gets rid of one bomb, but...  And then at the last second goes, wait, where's... 
[00:43:00]  He's like, hey, wait a minute.  Wait, where does this wire go?  Yeah.  And I knew exactly where the wire went, because they show the fucking clip on TV over and over  again.  It's on the movie poster, apparently, too.  Is it really?  Yeah.  Why do they need to do that?  When he pulls that wire up, and six shells are attached to it.  There's six more bombs he's got to deal with.  They're all around him.  Or IUDs, whatever.  Oh, shit.  But I'm like, as soon as he started following the wire, I'm like, oh, I know.  This is the scene I've seen a million times.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you, Hollywood.  Why would anyone do that? 
[00:43:30]  I'm too stupid.  I don't...  I need to know what I'm going to see before I see it.  Why would anyone do that?  Why?  Yeah, that's the question today.  Why?  I don't know.  I don't even mean for the movie.  I mean, like, in the military.  Like, why would you say, I want my job to be...  I lay on my stomach and unplug bombs.  Crazy fuckers, man.  Unplugging them, Jimmy.  They do.  These guys are fucking out of them.  How do you come back from that and then have a civilized life?  Well, that's why you guys see The Hurt Locker. 
[00:44:00]  Did you see it?  Sure.  Oh, you saw The Hurt Locker?  I loved it.  Oh, okay, okay.  What I'm saying is how boring is the world after that?  Exactly.  Your life could be gone in a split second so many times.  You're in that environment.  Yeah.  And then you go home to what?  We talked about it.  Where all of a sudden these guys, they have an insane job over there.  And then they come home and they're driving around in a minivan.  Yeah.  Like, how do you deal with that?  Yeah.  How do you deal with adjusting when you come back from Iraq? 
[00:44:30]  Your wife wants you to go to the barbecue?  Afghanistan.  Yeah.  And you're just kind of like, I don't know.  Yeah.  I was just, you know.  I was just defusing bombs.  You're on your stomach unplugging it.  Yeah.  Just to make it interesting for yourself.  But Hollywood, you know, they could go suck a dick for giving away that scene.  You know?  Yeah.  With the six bombs.  I'm like, ugh.  Because that is a really dramatic scene.  It really is.  And then he slowly pulls on that wire and reveals all those IUDs.  That's great, too.  With that scene where the guy is holding the cell phone. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  And they drop the cell phone.  Drop the cell phone.  Yeah.  That is fantastically done.  What was a great scene was the sniping scene I was telling you about before the show today.  That was filmed.  That was well done.  Yeah.  Because in movies, usually the snipe scenes are what?  A couple seconds?  A couple seconds.  The guy takes one shot and hits the guy.  They're basically showing you in this movie that these guys camp out all day long waiting  to see if maybe there's still some movement at their target. 
[00:45:30]  They showed how they were just laying there for eight straight hours or however, and probably  eight to ten hours, just completely exhausted, just staring at the target to see if anybody  was still alive or moving around in there.  Unbelievable.  I like when he took the bomb suit off.  It's just like, look, there's so much shit here.  This suit isn't going to do anything because I might as well be comfortable.  Yeah.  At that point, the bomb suit's not going to do shit for you.  He's unplugging it. 
[00:46:00]  He's trying to defuse a car bomb, and he's got a perimeter with his own guys to make  sure he's safe.  Yeah.  And the tension building in this scene is so great.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because there's a lot of Iraqis around.  Yep.  And you do understand how every one of them looks like a potential enemy, and a lot of  them aren't doing anything.  They could be the guy pushing the button.  But yet, they're not doing anything.  It shows you what the soldiers are in.  You have to make these snap judgments, what guys are doing across the street.  That's one of the best parts of that movie, is the tension that just having these Iraqis 
[00:46:30]  around, the way they're looking at the soldiers, they're looking at them kind of like, yeah,  I'm the guy, I'm the guy, but they're not.  They're basically saying, we're all the guy.  They're just the guy.  And then the guy's like, there'll be a couple of guys on a balcony looking, another guy's  filming him with a video camera.  Yep.  And it's like, there's a guy with a camera.  What do we, you know?  And they can't engage him or anything, and he might just be taking video.  Like, you just don't know.  And that's all the guy was doing.  He was just filming them.  Yeah, just filming them. 
[00:47:00]  There were soldiers.  Did I say IUDs?  What are they called?  Oh, IUDs.  IUDs.  Why don't you let me slide on the IUDs?  I need tension, dude.  If I caught IUD.  You might want to listen to me a little more.  You're going to pick up on some good stuff.  If I would have caught IUD, that is fantastic.  I said it twice, too.  He's in a woman's pussy trying to.  I was still thinking of teleprompter.  I'm sitting here.  I love how they fly in.  Teleprompters.  Right.  A black horse teleprompter.  Yes.  All these words you smack around.  I'm sitting here going, when are they going to do that? 
[00:47:30]  You're going to throw me under the bus.  I didn't catch it.  I guess I'll throw myself under the bus.  I know.  I said IUDs twice.  Wow.  Dude, it's one of those weird things.  I didn't catch it.  I didn't either.  IUD.  The poor bastard's in a suit.  He's got a speculum.  Giant vagina open.  People are screaming, shut up about this fucking movie.  If you haven't seen it already.  We're not really blowing it.  We're not giving away the ending where the guy, there's a big bomb, and he makes a hat out  of it, and he sells it.  That's the end of the movie.  He makes a bomb hat, and he sells bomb hats.  Like Opie said, it's a simple movie. 
[00:48:00]  It really is very basic.  The tension, you can't give away the fact that there's tension in the movie.  Right.  It's just a really good fucking movie.  It's not going to win best film.  You don't think so?  No.  That was good, man.  It was really good, but I don't think it's going to win best film.  It's really done well.  I think your film needs a little more than what the film offered.  I mean, the tension, like you said.  But what it is, it's great.  They have like four or five scenes that are just amazing.  What Avatar should get is.  The Avatar. 
[00:48:30]  You haven't seen Avatar.  I hate it.  I want to see Avatar.  We're going to have a snow day tomorrow.  Go see Avatar.  Snow day tomorrow?  I think so.  12 to 15 inches here in New York.  Yay!  I'm going to sit by my radio.  I will be here.  I'm going to sit by my radio and listen for the radio station closings.  Are they going to do that?  Yes.  That'd be really funny.  Sirius XM is completely closed, except for the Opie and Anthony show.  Of course.  That's how they would handle it around here.  I know.  Exactly.  Because they love us.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I'm going to promote the hell out of you guys. 
[00:49:00]  I love having us on here.  Because they didn't promote you at the other joint.  And then the scene with the guy that decided, what was he, a suicide bomber?  Yeah.  He had a lot of fucking hardware strapped to him, and they were trying to defuse him.  That's an exciting scene.  I'll keep it at that.  You want to talk about tension.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that's what it is.  It's just the whole movie has you nervous when you watch it.  You're just nervous the whole movie.  I have to see Avatar, but from what I've seen, Precious was very good. 
[00:49:30]  Hurt Locker was a better movie.  I think, obviously, Education was, eh, this is much better than that.  This is much better than that fucking George Clooney movie.  I agree.  So out of those four movies, this is the best.  I would say this.  There's no way Julie and Julia is going to be the best picture of this.  Crazy Heart I haven't seen.  We saw that fucking Cook movie.  Was Crazy Heart nominated for best film?  Because that's a pretty damn good film.  Dude, there was ten of them.  I know, I know, I know.  Ten movies, man.  Jesus Christ.  Hurt Locker's got to be, I mean, I know they're going to give it to Avatar. 
[00:50:00]  It's just that they just have to.  I think Hurt Locker's right up there.  But I don't think, I think it's going to fall short.  I really do.  And Precious, I don't think, gets best film, but wins all sorts of acting awards.  Like acting awards.  Hurt Locker, they may give best picture.  They may give Avatar best director.  And they may give him best, whatever.  They may give him a best director.  But usually they get the same.  I say they give him, he wins for best film, best director, and all the technical awards.  It's going to win all the technical awards.  But doesn't win any of the, you know, acting awards. 
[00:50:30]  No.  That's where I'm going with that damn thing.  But this, the Hurt Locker.  I mean, this movie came out of nowhere, too, man.  It really did.  I don't really remember hearing a buzz on it when it was in theaters and stuff.  And then you started talking about it.  And then I started hearing a little Oscar buzz.  I'm like, what the fuck is this Hurt Locker about?  Yeah, I finally saw it last night.  I saw it on a pay-per-view in L.A. Hotel.  I didn't hear about it much in the theaters either.  It was fucking great, man.  Yeah, I liked it.  Kenny told me about it.  I liked it a lot.  I never heard of it.  He just liked it because the word hurt was in it. 
[00:51:00]  I mean, you're hurt.  Locker.  Like what we used to do with the perps.  Throw them against the lockers.  He thought it was about fucking William Hurt's gym locker.  The Hurt Locker.  I was very disappointed.  I wanted to see his socks and gym shoes.  I still like the IUD thing.  IUD.  Exploding IUDs.  That would be a hell of a bomb, though.  How do you diffuse that shit?  Oh, my God.  Very dangerous.  Eddie in St. Louis.  Eddie.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Eddie. 
[00:51:30]  You really don't need to look past the DGA Awards to figure out how the Oscars are going to play out.  I know a lot of people like Avatar, but I don't consider it a serious contender.  I think Catherine Bigelow is going to be the first.  She should be the first female to get the director award.  I don't think Reiner is going to get best actor.  Well, slow down a little bit.  She directed the Hurt Locker.  And I do believe, slow down a little bit, sir.  I'm going to add a little knowledge here.  Wasn't she married to James Cameron?  Yes, she was.  Okay.  So that's something that the people should know.  That's kind of interesting that they're going for the same award and they used to be married. 
[00:52:00]  Go ahead.  No.  I just honestly, I think it's a very important film.  It's pretty sad that the only time that we've been hearing about the war lately is with this movie.  I think that they're just going to vote for the message film.  And, you know, no matter what the message is, I don't really think you could call it an anti-war picture.  And I really respected that.  It was right down the middle, just kind of a documentary thing.  And that's what makes it so great is it's not politicized.  That's why it might have a chance because you're absolutely right.  There was no political message for the most part with the Hurt Locker.  Hollywood is not going to vote for a war movie that has a political message especially. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, yeah.  This had no political message.  So it might have a chance, but I don't know.  Also, the voting is so watered down now with the format changes,  I think you're going to see some really perverted shit happening the next couple of years.  Like the plurality is just going to get so messed up, you can see stupid pictures winning Best Picture.  So what do you think about whether the DGA did their awards already?  Yeah, basically it's like this.  I think only twice in history, and one time it happened to Stanley Kubrick,  did somebody win the DGA Award and not win the Oscar for Best Director. 
[00:53:00]  So it's pretty much a stone-cold lead lock.  Who was the Best Picture and Best Director was Bigelow in the Hurt Lock?  Yeah, I think so.  Wow.  But Best Actor, probably not.  Who won supporting was Monique, I think, right?  Yeah, I honestly don't see that brought from Precious winning shit.  I think that's a sympathy nomination.  No, no, not the lead.  I think the lead was good, but she doesn't deserve Best Actress.  Monique is a supporting actress.  I think she deserves it. 
[00:53:30]  She was fucked.  She's a comic.  She was amazing.  Yeah, she looks scary.  Dude, she was so good in that.  Some tells me that's the real her.  I just don't know how people talk about Jerry Lewis doing such a great acting job in the  King of Comedy.  And it was like, no, that's just Jerry Lewis.  I think you're right, because this bra doesn't shave her legs, so she's got something going  on in that crazy head of hers.  She's tremendous.  She should win the Oscar Mayer.  Who's winning Best Picture with these other award shows?  I'm actually angry at Anthony for doing that to my ears. 
[00:54:00]  Holy shit.  That's horrible.  Oh my God.  That joke should be pulled out on a string with six other just like it.  That's a good line, dude.  You might have to use that one on stage.  That's really good.  God, I love a good bomb.  It has everything, bombs and a nice pop culture reference.  Eddie. 
[00:54:30]  Yes, sir.  So what film is winning all the awards right now?  Honestly, I really haven't kept up with the awards.  Like I said, it was such a shitty year for movies.  I'm really, 90% of the stuff that I watch is probably foreign.  I mean, I'll go and see all the, what I consider the Oscar nominations.  But yeah, I really, I don't take it seriously.  And now, I really, I don't even think I'm going to watch the Oscars this year.  Because it's just, what's the fucking point?  It's like the NHL playoffs.  Everybody's invited almost.  Yeah, I kind of like watching the Oscars every year. 
[00:55:00]  It's a pretty good fucking show.  Well, it's an alright show.  But it's, there's a lot of...  You guys think that Steve Martin and Alec Baldwin are going to do a good job?  No, no, no.  Of course not.  I think Alec Baldwin will.  I think Alec Baldwin has the potential to do real well.  And Jimmy defended Steve Martin and said he's a pretty good Oscar vote.  I think Steve Martin is the funniest Oscar host I've seen.  He's a really...  When Steve Martin is just standing there being shitty to people, he's fucking hilarious.  Being shitty to people?  Yeah, like Steve Martin is just a funny dude. 
[00:55:30]  When he is doing, to me, what makes him really good, which is just kind of being snippy and sarcastic and just writing.  I think he's very funny, man.  I just don't like a lot of the movie choices he's made, but he was a really great host when he did it.  And he was funny.  He accepted an award not too long ago.  I want to say it's some achievement award at Lincoln Center or something.  And he was great.  He was just great.  Alright, Eddie.  Good job, brother.  Thank you.  Good phone call.  Let's go to Mike in Alabama.  Mike.  Mike.  Hey.  I just want to go back and talk about the snipers. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  How when they camp out for like 8 to 10 hours all day long and they're coming in acting like  badasses and everything, but they smell because they're out there and they can't get up.  They can't move.  They have to crap all over themselves and piss all over themselves all throughout the day.  Oh, that's right.  They whiz themselves, right?  Yeah.  I mean, I had no idea because, I mean, when they show snipers in movies, it's never like  they did in the Hurt Locker.  And they show you where these guys, I'm saying it again, obviously, but they show you where 
[00:56:30]  they just lay in the same position for 8 to 10 hours.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They can't move or anything and they just have nowhere else to go.  Imagine how fucking tight and sore you would be laying in one position for 8 hours.  I can't picture just shitting my pants and sitting there, but when there's a real threat  of a guy fucking taking the top of your head off of the rifle, you'll shit your pants.  You'll shit your pants.  And usually it's a waiting game.  Whoever can wait the longest, right?  Mikey.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I would hate to think of shit while a gun might be pointed at me.  When he fucking, I, movies are getting so good with showing heads just turn into pink 
[00:57:00]  mist with a 50 Cal sniper shot.  Yeah.  God damn.  Uh, let's go to Kyle in Kentucky.  Kyle.  Okay.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Yeah, I've heard this a lot, but go ahead, Kyle.  Hey, I just wanted to say, I'm in the army right now and any of the guys that I've been  with that I watched that movie just hate it because it's so fake, nothing in it is real  whatsoever.  Yeah.  Well, it's, you know, that's a movie.  In the hurt locker?  Yeah. 
[00:57:30]  Um, I, for any vet that's been over there, for one, the, uh, EOG guys, all they do is  send a little robot up and blow up a bomb.  They don't go within 500 yards of any explosive.  Yeah.  Why would you?  Yeah.  Well, I understand, you know, war as hell and all that, but.  They show that in the beginning, so they kind of, um, kind of acknowledge an excuse as  to why they're not doing that.  Dude, there's got to be times where the guys go in because you can't just blow off every  bomb that you find.  You have to defuse some of them, don't you?  Um, there's a few times where it's in an urban area, but unless it's like the president's 
[00:58:00]  house, you're just going to blow up a house with the bomb.  They'll just blow up whatever the bomb is around.  Yeah.  Blow it up.  Fuck it.  Dude, the scene with the, uh, the kid, wow.  It happened.  Yes.  The, the scene with the kid, wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If it's a suicide bomber scene, that guy would be dead in about two seconds and then we would  blow him up.  What would they do?  Just, uh, kill him?  Yeah, we'd just shoot him. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, you would have to just shoot that guy.  Were you in the military, sir?  Yeah, it sounds like.  Yeah, he said he's in the army.  Were you in the military or your friends are?  I'm in the army right now.  Okay.  I just got back about eight months ago.  Oh, you were over?  Okay.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Uh, let's go to Joe in Jersey.  Joe?  He was in country.  Yes, he was.  Joe?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hey, man.  The, uh, the, the, well, I was there, the movie took place in 2004, correct?  The, uh, oh, uh, okay.  I, I, I, I didn't pick up on that.  We didn't have in 2004.  We had nothing in 2004. 
[00:59:00]  And I was one of those guys that went out and defused bombs.  Oh.  We shot, we shot them on our M-16s.  The bombs?  Yeah, like, they would put them in, in, uh, dead cows and dead dogs and stuff on the side  of the road.  So you just shoot them, either with your M-16 or if you had a 50 cal up front, you shoot  them.  And if they exploded, they exploded.  If they didn't, then you rode by them.  So did you ever walk, like they do in the Hurt Locker, walk up to this, uh, you know,  situation?  Never came within 500 yards, they were saying.  Yeah.  Yeah, a lot of people are saying that.  It still, it still was a great movie, though, man. 
[00:59:30]  It's a movie, yeah.  The thing about realism and stuff, it's just, there's a tension there.  There's, I, I don't care if it, it's realistic, you know, as far as the real thing goes.  Not really, because remember when they got Udi, uh, Roadblock?  The Checkpoint Roadblock?  Right.  Yes.  In the car?  He wouldn't have lived.  Oh, right, right, yeah.  You never blow a checkpoint and live.  Just doesn't happen.  Same thing with all those guys with the video camera.  Mm-hmm.  They, we would engage all those people.  You would just take them all out. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, you would have to, man.  You're in a hostile situation.  That car scene, though, was really amazing.  That was amazingly shot, too.  Yeah, it's just, it was a fucking movie.  Well, Avatar, oh, Avatar wasn't real either.  Oh, my God.  Good point.  You know, I went to another planet, and it was nothing like, uh, Pandora.  Pandora.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Good point, brother.  Let's go to Dave in, uh, San Antonio.  Dave.  Dave.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up?  Talking about the Hurt Locker.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm a captain in the Army.  Two tours over there. 
[01:00:30]  And, uh, yeah, you talk about your life falling apart when you get home.  Everything is boring as shit.  I've been through two marriages, and there is just nothing that excites you anymore once  you get back from over there.  Yeah.  And what, do you mislike your buddies and stuff?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, it's just boring.  You're just driving around, and you want to shoot people on the road when you're driving  to work because they just can't drive.  Well, you don't have to have gone over there to want that. 
[01:01:00]  These guys have been in real situations, and it makes it a little tougher not to when  you come home.  Yeah, they've been in situations where they could do that.  Yeah.  Yep.  Hey, can I make one more comment about the caller that said EOD is within 500 yards?  Yeah.  That wasn't true in our situation.  They, uh, they'd go right up to them.  We were infantry.  We'd clear the lanes for them.  They'd come up, and they'd disassemble bombs all day long, and they'd be within, like,  20 yards of it.  And sometimes they'd go off and hit the vehicles.  We'd have to medevac them.  So, it's, every situation is different.  And I haven't seen the movie. 
[01:01:30]  I just don't ever see those kind of movies anymore.  I would imagine.  Hey, guys, I'm punching out.  I would imagine you wouldn't want to.  Hey, a guy I follow on Twitter, SoMedic, he writes, uh, that's the question.  How do you come home and live a normal life?  And then he answers, some of us just can't.  Yeah, well, you know, it seems to be a problem.  Yeah, let's go to Bob in D.C.  Bob.  Yeah, the guy who made the comment about the sniper smelling when they come in, um, due  to the advent of adult diapers, i.e.  depends, so what you do before you go out on an LPOP or any kind of op like that is 
[01:02:00]  you put some depends on.  Yeah, that's true.  You have to piss yourself and maybe crap your pants, but because the nice thing about meals  ready to eat is they, uh, tend to bind you up so you don't crap as much.  So, uh, you know, you keep it big and your depends, you come back, clean up with some  baby wipes, and you're good to go.  Okay.  MREs.  I heard their, um, diapers are a commodity.  Yeah.  Really?  MRE, the new vernacular is downrange, not in-country.  Ah, downrange, really? 
[01:02:30]  Downrange.  Right on, brother.  I would just say, if I was over there, I was over in Iraq.  That's how I say it.  I know the lingo.  MREs.  MREs.  Downrange.  Yes, sir.  What's up, MREs?  I work with a bunch of, uh, how are you guys doing?  Hey.  I work with a bunch of UXO and EOD techs, and, uh, we do, uh, all explosive removals on  all the bases around the country, and there's plenty of work out here for these guys and  stuff.  They ain't really disarray and stuff, but some of them told me about that herd locker and 
[01:03:00]  stuff, and they said it's a bunch of crap.  I haven't seen the movie myself, but I will sit down and check it out and stuff.  Yeah.  But, uh, it is interesting work and stuff, and, um, like I said, you know, it's work  out there for them when they come home and stuff.  They just gotta look around.  Hmm.  Okay.  I see a lot of the guys in the military are like, well, it's not real and stuff like  that, but, you know, something.  That doesn't, like you said, it's a movie.  Yeah, it's a movie.  And it was very, very enjoyable.  It's great.  It's great. 
[01:03:30]  And that's the dude from The Wire, man.  Who?  The black guy?  Um, yeah, he was in The Wire.  Who was he in The Wire?  I don't remember his freaking name in The Wire.  It's been too long.  Oh, Marlo.  No, it wasn't Marlo.  Someone said it's Marlo.  It's not Jamie Hector.  I would recommend it.  Yeah, it wasn't Marlo.  Someone said it's Marlo.  It's not Marlo.  Steve from Bayshore said he played the Negro.  Oh, very good, Steve.  We were just watching a suicide bomber scene, which is on here.  It's fucking so tense, this scene.  Yeah.  God damn, this is good. 
[01:04:00]  And finally, DJ Damage from Philly.  DJ.  What's up, man?  What's up?  I'm just not really feeling the whole love of The Hurt Locker.  It was an okay movie, but it was like the top gun of war movies to me.  Why?  There was no fucking...  Because the main guy comes in, you know, okay, first of all, the first dude gets killed.  All right, fine.  And then you go to the new guy, he's all cocky.  I don't need a suit to go defuse this bomb.  I'll defuse it without the suit.  I'm uncomfortable.  It's like Maverick. 
[01:04:30]  You might as well call him Maverick on the bomb defusal guy.  Yeah, but these guys weren't corny, dude.  And I think that there probably are guys like that overseas who just, you know, get to a point where you're a little fucking nuts.  I like that.  Go ahead, sir.  Maverick was corny.  I can get his character, but another thing about it was it just wasn't enough real, like, character.  Development, to me, as far as the guy that came in.  Like, we don't know shit about him until he goes back home.  The greatest scene was when they started beating the shit out of each other inside the barracks. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, but they had to take their shirts off for that scene.  I'm like, why do they have to take their shirts off?  They're getting into this whole fight situation, almost like a fight club thing, in between defusing bombs.  And all of a sudden, the guy goes, but take your shirt off.  I'm like, what does that have to do with anything?  Speak the shit out of each other.  Well, you know, sometimes it is hard.  But, oh, yeah, the black guy, that's the guy from The Wire.  He was in the 8 Mile.  Yeah, but who did he play in The Wire?  I can't remember.  I don't think he was in The Wire.  He wasn't in The Wire.  He said he was in the 8 Mile.  Oh, he wasn't. 
[01:05:30]  You think about the guy who played Marlowe.  That's not him.  No, I know that's not Marlowe.  No.  All right, Jamie Hector played Marlowe.  He was in the 8 Mile.  The guy who battled Eminem at the end that choked up, he played a...  I didn't see him.  Oh, Papaduck, right.  I didn't see him.  When Eminem just kind of trashed himself, and then he said good things about the other guy.  He went to a good school, had good parents.  He was in that, and he was in that Spike Lee movie, She Hate Me, or something like that.  Okay.  For some reason, I thought it was in The Wire.  I guess I have to give up on that.  Thank you, sir. 
[01:06:00]  DJ Danage, everyone.  Let's go to Joey on Long Island.  Joey!  What's going on, boys?  You ready for the snow, Joey?  Oh, I can't wait.  You're going to be shoveling them all day, Joe.  Yeah, I'm going to be shoveling them for like 30 hours, but money's great.  So, anyways, you guys are talking about, you know, like soldiers assimilating back into,  you know, population when you get back.  We went, a mutual friend of me and my cousins got back from Iraq and lost his leg by a, I hope  you call it, an IUD. 
[01:06:30]  And, you know, when he was back, he's got the fake leg and whatnot.  And we went, you know, went to go see Jim Jeffries over at Caroline, you know, a couple  months back, and he just, you know, he drinks, and he just doesn't know how to fucking act,  man.  Jim Jeffries was ripping into him, but, like, had no idea why the guy was acting like an  asshole.  Yeah.  So, it's just, you know, it's fucked up.  You know, my father has the same thing with the PTSD and Agent Orange from getting back  to Vietnam and shit. 
[01:07:00]  And it's just, it's fucked up, man.  These guys are out there by themselves.  And, you know, it's, I just feel bad for them.  So, what you're saying here, in summation, is Jim Jeffries is a cunt.  No, he was great, but he had no idea, you know, the kid was flipping his leg around  in circles, and Jim Jeffries was just like, you know what doesn't mix with alcohol?  Your personality.  It just fucking ripped into him.  It was fucking terrible.  When you said that he didn't drink and didn't know how to act, I actually thought you meant  Jim Jeffries.  I know, that's what I thought he meant, too.  And I'm like, I was ready to agree. 
[01:07:30]  I've been out with that lunatic when he's drinking.  He is a drunkard.  That's why he was talking about a stupid Boy Scout story with his scout master was sticking  his fingers in his ass, just jerking off on the corner on him, whatever.  Fucking Jeffries has some great comedy, man.  He's coming back.  He wrote me on Twitter recently.  He comes back in March or something.  Jim Jeffries is a slob.  He says he can't wait to see us.  And then a couple weeks later, I went to go see Jimmy over there.  I brought him some marmalade to sign for me.  Oh, I remember.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're signing a marmalade now, Jimmy? 
[01:08:00]  Jimmy lied.  He doesn't like marmalade.  He didn't even react when I brought it home.  Hope you enjoyed my wealth of new material.  Yes, I did.  Thank you.  Kenny peddling books for you, too, was pretty funny.  Kenny really is a fucking...  It's a whore.  It's a whole thing if you go to Jimmy's shows.  All right.  Thank you, Joey.  Let me go to...  Thank you.  Let's go to Matt and tape him.  Matt.  Morning, boys.  Hello.  First off, going back to Hurt Locker, the guy who's comparing this to Top Gun is out of  his fucking mind.  Of course he is.  I agree with you, actually.  I jerked off more to Top Gun. 
[01:08:30]  Of course.  The volleyball scene.  Stop it.  And he was talking about the scene in the barracks where they're punching each other.  Yeah.  Why is the guy out of taking his shirt off?  Yeah.  I'm thinking the same thing.  All right.  Here we go.  Top Gun shower scene all over again.  Yeah.  Then you see this guy's got bomb shrapnel scars all over his damn body.  Well, they were...  They were going to show how crazy he is.  The last guy's talking about no character development.  Well, there it is for you right there.  Yeah, but my issue with that, we already knew he was crazy.  I figured that he was probably in some crazy situations that might have thrown some shrapnel 
[01:09:00]  around his body, you know?  It was just weird.  It was just so forced.  It's like, take your shirt off so we could fight.  And then, oh, wow, now that your shirt's off, look at that.  You are as crazy as we thought.  I don't know.  I just...  I don't have to be spoon-fed some of this shit that Hollywood throws at you.  You can kind of figure it out on your own.  That's the difference between you and most people, though.  No, I don't agree with that whatsoever. 
[01:09:30]  That's why I do get frustrated.  I think people in general are smarter than Hollywood thinks they are.  And they don't have to spoon-feed every fucking thing to us.  You know what I hate in a movie?  Is the, like, two-second recap.  Is the two-second recap?  Like, somebody will say something, and you're supposed to go, in your head, anyway, like,  oh, that's why he took that piece out of the glove compartment of the car. 
[01:10:00]  Right, right.  And then they have to actually show...  Right.  They have to show the scene of him taking it out of the...  So you can go, oh!  I was right!  I remember!  Yeah.  It's like, just in case you forgot.  Yeah.  I fucking...  It's insulting.  I think it is, too.  It's like, I've been watching the movie.  You don't have to worry about that.  Right.  Or when a character addresses another character, and he's explaining something, not like he  would talking to the character in the movie, he might as well just turn to the camera and 
[01:10:30]  talk directly to the audience, because it's the only reason that dialogue is happening.  And that's what bothered me about part of Precious.  There was a moment like that, especially in the last ten minutes of the movie, where  what they were doing was obviously to give a message to the audience and not...  I just thought they kind of left the context of the characters, which bothered me.  That really...  But it's still a good movie.  I would love to get someone on our show that could explain all this and why they do it,  because it sounds so ridiculous and looks so ridiculous when you see a trailer that gives  away the entire movie. 
[01:11:00]  I'm assuming they know what they're doing, and there's a reason why they do that.  What is the reason?  What is the reason for showing that the wire leads to six bombs in the herd locker?  Because you want to be surprised by that scene if you go to the flick.  Yeah, that's what they call the holy shit moment.  Of course, but now they just give away the holy shit moments on the trailer, or on the  previews, whatever.  Yeah, let's go to Sarah.  Sarah in Jersey.  Sarah. 
[01:11:30]  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Pretty good.  Sarah.  Well, first of all, Opie, I hate to tell you, but Americans really are that stupid.  I hate to think that.  So sometimes they really do need to be stupid.  All right.  I teach high school.  I know that.  She teaches high school.  She knows that.  Two, my father was a 30-year Army vet, and he did two tours in Korea and two tours in  Vietnam, and I have really great respect for the military and everything that those guys  do, but this movie is fiction. 
[01:12:00]  It's a movie, and I'm with Anthony on this one.  It's a movie, and it's meant to get through, like, a message.  It's not a documentary.  So I know all these guys are really hung up on the realism of it, and they get all tweaked  about the fact that it's not exactly like true life, but it's not meant to be like true  life.  If they want true life, they need to watch documentaries.  Movies aren't meant to be exactly like real life. 
[01:12:30]  Yes and no, but sometimes a movie is made, and the message of the movie is, this is the  way it is.  Like, there are times where you're right, it's a movie, like cop movies and stuff, but  this one is painted as if it's a pretty realistic movie.  I think it is realistic in the fact that when they get to the end point of that, I can't  go back home and have real life anything like something I can live.  That's the message that's important, and that's what they get across.  I think that's the most important thing. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  I thought that was the fifth most important thing.  Great.  Thank you, Sarah.  Let's go to Kate in Massachusetts.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  All right.  Yeah, I agree with Sarah.  I mean, it's a goddamn movie.  If you want to see documentaries, then go see documentaries.  As far as, I mean, it's a freaking movie.  I'm sure they take, you know, certain situations or certain things from, you know, the war and  whatever, but it's a goddamn movie. 
[01:13:30]  Get a grip, people.  It's just like people getting depressed over Avatar.  I mean, it's a goddamn movie.  Get a grip.  It's just, you know, it always irks me when people get all freaked out over movies and  crap.  It's a freaking movie.  All right.  Cool.  Thank you, Kate.  So, get a grip.  I think where a lot of that's coming from, though, is the guys that are over there.  Mm-hmm.  You know, and they're like, fuck, I was over there.  This is frustrating to me.  It wasn't like that.  Yeah. 
[01:14:00]  Because we don't say that about other movies.  We don't care in general.  No, you don't sit there in the movies.  But if you're fighting the good fight over there and you come home and you see the Hurt  Locker, you might be a little outraged because you're like, look, man, I was there.  This isn't how we did things.  This is not representing what we did over there.  There's got to be a soldier who's listening who thinks it was realistic, unless it was completely  unrealistic.  But there's got to be one soldier.  I can't find one.  No?  Oh, okay.  Why don't we take a break?  Hey, it's Black History Month.  We're going to acknowledge somebody here.  Actually, the great Chris Rock. 
[01:14:30]  Check this out.  Yeah, let's get this done.  Another fine radio show for you.  For you, the fucker.  What's up, fuckers?  Don't forget, we got Roy Jones Jr.  One of the greatest fighters of all time.  I don't know.  Pound for pound, absolutely, man.  What's that pound for pound shit, Jimmy?  Sugar Ray Robinson is the guy I think they started using that term with.  Yeah.  Because to say the greatest fighter of all time, that's like Sugar Ray Robinson, an average 
[01:15:00]  heavyweight or a medium level heavyweight probably would have beat Sugar Ray Robinson because  of the drastic weight and strength difference.  But what does the pound for pound mean?  Meaning matched up with somebody with equal weight.  Okay.  You can only judge Floyd Mayweather against other guys in his weight class.  Oh, I gotcha.  You can't judge him against Mike Tyson.  I gotcha.  Or, you know, any other guys.  Well, that makes sense, that pound for pound thing.  Yeah, sure does.  You hear it a lot.  These guys are very fucking tough, but, you know, it's hard to beat a guy who's 90 or  100 pounds heavier than you.  Hey, one of our themes today, we try to have a few themes for you guys, is mismanagement. 
[01:15:30]  And there's another story that...  Who is she?  This is another story hitting today that's just ridiculous.  The airlines.  I personally don't understand how they can't turn a profit and figure shit out.  I don't understand it.  I really don't.  And American Airlines is now going to charge everybody $8 for a pillow and blanket.  $8 for a pillow and a blanket.  $8 for a pillow and blanket.  You get to keep it?  You get to take it home.  No, just to rent a smelly pillow with someone else's bad breath on it. 
[01:16:00]  I think you get to keep it.  Oh, really?  On JetBlue, you do.  Really?  On JetBlue, for $7, you can buy some type of a combo.  I don't remember what.  I bring my own.  Just buy it and bring it on the plane.  How ridiculous is that?  Continental started it with their wispy, shitty blankets they have.  He wears a Snuggie on his bike.  It looks like a Snuggie.  It rules.  It's a big...  It's one of those Brookstone...  It's like a big, cushy, fucking blue blanket. 
[01:16:30]  Plus, it's gross to everybody else's fucking body stuff on your blanket.  Yeah.  It's...  No, I think you can keep them, right?  I think you do keep them.  But you do see how ridiculous that is, right?  Well, yeah.  It's for Coach.  They're doing it.  And even at first, they only have blankets now.  They don't have pillows.  It's so shitty.  It's nothing now.  You're right.  It's shit.  I flew first class recently.  It's a little bit bigger seat.  And you get a little bigger seat.  That's it.  You're not getting anything special anymore.  On American United first, you get like a big...  Because I got lucky.  Leno flew me.  They took very nice carry.  They give you... 
[01:17:00]  You get like a comforter and a fucking giant pillow.  Wow.  That would rule.  It's unbelievable.  That would make flying so nice.  I started bringing my own pillow on flights.  Really?  Yeah.  It's pretty fucking...  What is it?  Where do you put it?  You just carry it.  I have a neck pillow.  No, I go full-size fucking pillow.  Wait, wait, wait.  You got a little carry-on bag.  And then you got a pillow under your arm?  Fuck yeah.  For comfort.  For the longer flights.  Under your arm?  You just got a bag to carry it in.  Why a bag?  I just fucking grab it off my bed at last minute. 
[01:17:30]  And I freaking drive to the airport.  The pillow's on my lap.  And I fucking walk through the airport with my damn pillow.  And you got to put your pillow on the dirty thing to go through security?  Yeah.  Look.  Ugh.  I would put it in a bag.  It's easier to carry, too.  I got a fucking bag for my pillow.  Gives a shit.  What kind of germs am I picking up with this dumb pillow?  Yeah, the flu is in there.  The flu?  There's people's shoes on there.  Yeah, people step in shit when you put your pillow on there.  Oh. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  The things you've done in your past and you're worried about a pillow?  I'm just saying.  A dumb pillow case.  It made me hungry.  But $8 for the pillow and blanket.  I mean, it's unbelievable.  I don't mind them charging for food.  Actually, if they have better food.  Hey, look.  I don't.  You know, a few bucks.  You swipe it.  No more cash.  Just credit card.  Yeah.  I remember first class, though, being like a much bigger deal.  There was always food.  Didn't matter when you flew, there was always some food that came around throwing you out 
[01:18:30]  and shit.  Now there's, no, that flight's too short.  This one's this.  Well, fuck that.  Talk about coach.  They do the same thing with coach.  They have all sorts of excuses why they can't give you a little beverage and a little fucking  shitty thing of crackers.  But to pay to fly, again, I'm lucky because I'm flown that way.  It's part of standard network things.  Everybody involved gets that.  It's not a special treatment thing.  But to pay five times as much and then get no meal, it's fucking ridiculous. 
[01:19:00]  It's like JetBlue is great.  And the luggage thing is just completely ridiculous.  What airline is really hyping that they don't charge for the luggage thing?  I forgot.  They had a big campaign.  Southwest?  Southwest had a big campaign recently, like laughing at all the airlines.  Like, how dare you charge people to bring their luggage on your plane because they have  to go and live somewhere else for a couple days?  The luggage thing is really ridiculous. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, they really are.  I mean, the blanket and the pillow, it's a luxury.  I could sort of see it, but that bothers me too.  But when you start charging people because they want to bring luggage on their trip is,  you know, what are you doing?  But they just can't stop fucking you.  They can't stop.  Sickening.  It's really sickening.  I want to travel in the wheel well of a Delta.  Yeah, that doesn't work out too well.  Oopsie.  You know, you cut a few of these big salaries that I'm sure some of these guys are making  in the airline industry, and guess what? 
[01:20:00]  Then everyone could get their pillow and blanket.  Right.  And then feel like you're, then you would feel like you're being taken care of as you  fly their airline.  And then maybe you would go back to them.  Here's another great airplane story.  You hear about this one with this guy coming out of the bedroom?  You heard it right there?  Out of the bedroom?  No.  Listen to this.  U.S. Air Flight 1447 was on its way from Philadelphia to San Francisco.  It ended up in Pittsburgh.  And he was looking back at me, and he was waving like, hi.  Sitting in seat 17C was 30-year-old Kinman Chan on his way home. 
[01:20:30]  He's banging around.  He's screaming in the back bathroom.  He's opened all the compartments.  According to a criminal complaint, Chan walked out of the bathroom with his pants down.  I said, you need to sit down now.  He did not sit, but there's something he did not know.  I am a fourth-degree black belt in taekwondo.  He went like that, with his elbow.  What I did was I just put him in an arm lock, and he was resisting.  He was just, he was stiff, like this.  So at that point is when I just put him in a choke hold.  The plane was diverted to Pittsburgh, where Chan was arrested. 
[01:21:00]  He told police he'd taken a double dose of his medicinal marijuana, eating two pot cookies  before the flight.  I'm glad I was there.  After 9-11, I took special training with my grandmaster.  This fucking guy ate two pot cookies.  He's fucking stoned.  He walks out of the bathroom.  This flight attendant says, fuck this.  I'm choking this guy out.  What a great story.  I've never been that high that I was yanking my dick out from the coach.  In coach.  What a great story.  Pants down, coming out of the bathroom.  The flight attendant's like, you know what? 
[01:21:30]  I ain't dealing with this shit.  You're going to sleep, motherfucker.  Isn't that good?  Yeah, it's great.  I was stoned.  Yeah, just stoned a little stoned Asian man.  Pot cookies.  Put his pants down.  All stoned.  His rotten little penis.  Not even clearing his pubes.  Medicinal pot fucking cookies.  Nice.  Well, yeah, let this guy just have his fun.  Go ahead, Mac.  Go ahead.  Hey, do you take your pass fire with you on the plane? 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, I do that, too.  Yeah, that's what I do.  You take a binky.  Yeah.  You're a little binky with you.  Fucking asshole.  Let's go to Bryon from PA.  Brian.  Morning, boys.  Good morning.  I got a bad story for you.  Recently, flew down on a business trip to Florida.  Had to take three different flights because of weather delays.  So, long story short, paid my $25.  Got to Mobile.  My luggage didn't make it.  It had gone to Montgomery because some nitwit couldn't decipher Mobile or Montgomery on the ticket. 
[01:22:30]  Long story short, had to go buy a suit for Monday meeting.  Got my luggage on Wednesday.  When I opened it up, there was clothes missing, brand new pair of running shoes missing, and my iPod, which I had rolled in clean underwear and stuck inside a shoe because I couldn't fit everything in my briefcase.  When I went to appeal at the airline, I sent them a pilferage form, which basically lists what got ripped off.  They wouldn't cover the iPod.  They wouldn't give me back my money that I paid them for the luggage, and they sent me back $70 for the shoes. 
[01:23:00]  You want to talk about getting screwed?  These people, once they got your money, man, forget it.  Now, what did you do?  Did you write to customer service?  Yeah, I faxed them a pilferage form.  They sent me back a standardized letter stating that they couldn't return money for electronic items.  Now, they'll return money up to $3,500 worth of clothing as long as you have receipts for it. 
[01:23:30]  I have a receipt for the iPod.  Now, stupid me, I know a lot of people are wondering, why did you put the iPod in your luggage?  I had barely any room to fit in my briefcase.  I was carrying so much crap at this point that literally it would have broken.  And, you know, the way you have to travel and take things out of your pants and everything else, I said, well, screw it.  Who's going to go through underwear?  You know what I mean?  Yeah, of course.  Oh, man, let me tell you.  Once they get your money, and then I appealed it.  I wrote them a letter saying, listen, while I understand your policy, how is it that you would cover for clothing but not this one electronic item that I have the receipt for? 
[01:24:00]  And, you know, basically what the airlines are telling you is that don't put anything worth anything unless it's like underwear or shirts because we're going to rip you off and we'll blatantly do it.  That's what basically they told me.  So I talked to my lawyer, buddy.  I said, listen, let's get cops involved.  You know, what happens when you get robbed?  You call the cops.  He's like, screw it, man.  Cops aren't going to deal with this one bit.  Not in an international airport.  Two things about your call.  First of all, God bless anyone that deals with customer service.  I don't even know what type of a human being it takes to do that. 
[01:24:30]  For real.  That's just insane because they'll drive you nuts.  And the second thing is who the fuck has receipts for their clothes?  No one does.  So they make it hard for you to get your money, you know, back for something they do.  No one keeps receipts.  And they know that.  They know the average person doesn't have receipts for their clothes.  Yeah.  I'll tell you one more thing, guys.  Unfortunately, I have no choice in the matter.  If my assistant manager puts me on that airline, I have to go on that airline. 
[01:25:00]  How about that, man?  Yeah.  So have a good day, guys.  Take care.  And the pot cookie story, a lot of people going, wow, you know, Joe Rogan should have  controlled himself better.  Yeah.  The only reason I didn't bring up Joe Rogan in that story is because Joe Rogan knows  how to fight, and that flight attendant would have been in deep shit.  He would have knocked her fucking ass out.  Oh, my God.  He would have.  No problem.  Joe likes hitting ladies.  You heard it here first.  Here you go.  Listen to this.  Jameson.  Jameson on Long Island.  What's up? 
[01:25:30]  What's up, man?  I flew out to L.A. and had my skis with me, and the actual, you know, believe it or not,  reasonable people at JFK were like, don't worry about it.  You know, we're supposed to charge it.  Don't worry about it.  I said, all right.  On the way back, same routine.  Tried to pull the, you know, schmooze in the mall.  Yeah, it's my skis.  No big deal.  You guys are not going to charge me, right?  Yeah, it's $60, sir, which I didn't have because I had a pretty rough weekend.  So my skis are now still in Los Angeles.  Oh, wonderful.  That's just great.  Yeah, town for town on the best list, then.  All right. 
[01:26:00]  Mike in Michigan.  Bill Bird did a shitload of material on his podcast about the airlines.  I said he had some luck using the magic word unacceptable to deal with management.  I would love to hear a little of that if it's good.  And also, for Sam, somebody on my Twitter, you know that extreme weatherman from the other  day we played?  I guess he's got a brand new forecast where he's being extreme.  I guess it's his thing now.  Oh, wow.  Is he trying too hard?  I guess it's his thing.  It's on Das Plumens' Twitter. 
[01:26:30]  D-A-S-P-L-U-M-E-N.  Give him a little credit today.  Oh, or you got it right there.  That's good, too.  Let's go to Don in Vegas.  Excuse me.  Don.  Morning, boys.  What's up, Don?  Hey, I got a quick comment about the Southwest not charging for Vax.  I fly Southwest constantly being out here on the West Coast.  I kind of have that luxury.  And the reason they don't charge for anything, and this kind of goes for all airlines, is  the airline union is so screwed up.  And I've talked with a lot of these guys, like on a lot of different airlines and flights,  and they can't manage their money worth a damn, and they never followed Southwest lead 
[01:27:00]  as far as locking in gas prices back in, I think it was like 2000, when they got it  at 59 bucks a barrel.  They were actually overpaying by a little bit, but in the long term, obviously, with the gas  spike up to 150 a barrel a few years back.  They saved a ton of money, and these airlines, especially ones like United and U.S. Air is  notorious for this.  They don't manage their money correctly worth any, you know, they just don't, they can't 
[01:27:30]  get a, they can't continue to get their shit together.  And to kind of get back to that one guy who lost his luggage and couldn't get it, couldn't  get any reimbursement, I had the same thing, because I do a lot of installs cross-country,  and I carry, I used to carry a backpack with all my tools and everything, I would check  it, everything was fine.  I had it walked off twice on two separate airlines, disappeared, never to be seen again,  they never reimbursed anything, because one, I had the tools, the first bag was about  two years, I didn't keep the receipts, obviously, just because they never reimbursed me, and 
[01:28:00]  the second time, they said they could only reimburse me up to $100, and I had easily  $600 worth of tools in there, but they said since it was over six months old, the wear  and tear only valued it at $100.  They're such pieces of shit.  You know what, but then, you have, but, but, they have to have a certain policy there, because  then anybody could just say, my stuff got stolen, and then what's their obligation to  pay?  They have to have certain parameters, but it's when you really do get ripped off by the  baggage handlers or whoever it is, you know, it's really sickening that they, I had a, 
[01:28:30]  I'm sick of, when they say policy, I had a United bag, bags lost, and my, I'm sorry,  my luggage was laid or whatever, so I go, and the guy's like, well, it gets in at 11, we  have a, a pickup at three, we can have it to you by six, because I came in at like nine  in the morning, I'm like, and like, it's funny, Bill Burr said that, like, that's not  acceptable, I'm like, I have a gig to do tonight, my clothes are on there, he goes,  well, our policy, I'm like, you lost my bags, I don't want to hear your policy, get me a 
[01:29:00]  supervisor, because I want you to put it in a taxi, if you sound like you know what  you're talking about, a lot of times they'll give you what you want, I'm like, why would  I wait?  So how do you get away with it?  Because I sound like I know what I'm talking about, I don't, I'm a good mimic of those  who do know what they're talking about.  I was wondering, yeah.  So he, I did get my bags early, they made sure that they rushed them over.  So you could get around that policy bullshit.  They can rush them over, so I don't want to hear your policy, take the hit, spend the fucking  money on a cab, because your airline's screwed up.  Well, Jimmy, have you ever had the layover where you get laid over on a 
[01:29:30]  flight, and they can't take your bag off the plane so you can get new clothes for  the next day, maybe?  No, I never had that.  Why would they do that?  No, no, no.  No, I had a flight when they were having those storms in the East Coast, I think it was back  in December.  I was flying from Florida, trying to get back to Vegas.  We got rerouted to Charlotte, and we got stuck in Charlotte because of the ice storms or whatever  they were going on, I think it was a day or two of ice storms.  And when I got off the plane, they said they couldn't take my bags off the plane because,  one, they involuntarily rerouted us to Charlotte. 
[01:30:00]  The policy is they can't pull the plane, the bags, off the plane until the plane reaches  its final destination.  I don't fault them as much when it's weather-related stuff, like those quote-unquote acts of God  and nature.  There's only so much an airline can do when it's really bad weather.  We just pull them the bags off the plane, and they can control that.  Maybe, maybe...  It's just odd policies, like you said.  It's just bizarre what they do.  Maybe it's a baggage handler issue.  Maybe they wouldn't have the baggage handler issue.  Yeah, in the end, they don't give a shit about the customer in almost every situation. 
[01:30:30]  They don't, but that might be why they do it.  Plus, if they can leave, if all of a sudden the flight has clearance two hours early or  not, maybe they don't want to go through all the trouble of putting the bags back on.  They want the plane to be ready to go.  I don't know.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Don.  We're going to move on, but Joey on Long Island has a very good observation about that  other guy with the iPod.  Go ahead, Joey.  Let's go on, boys.  Hey.  Listen, that guy couldn't fit a one-inch by two-inch iPod in a carry-on.  If you left some of his strap-ons at home, you left some of his strap-ons at home, he 
[01:31:00]  could have fit that in there.  That's a good point.  How full are your bags?  Yeah, we really did let that guy off the hook.  I mean, he was telling a pretty good fucking story of his experience, but still, the iPods  aren't really that big anymore.  They never really were.  Couldn't fit it in there, either.  You could put it in your front pocket.  Somebody stole my stamp!  I just couldn't get it into the luggage.  You could put it in your pants with your pocket money.  Very good, Joey.  That's why we love you fuckers. 
[01:31:30]  You pick up on everything.  All right.  We don't have to talk about the fucking airlines over and over again, I guess.  That's enough.  Enough about that, right?  That's enough.  I've been lucky over the years, which I'm jinxing myself.  Yeah.  But now, I barely ever even check a bag.  I'm Mr. Carry-On.  Mr. Carry-On.  Yeah.  Because you're allowed a carry-on for the overhead, and then I use my, as Sam would say,  biak-piak.  I have my biak-piak, and then a little, and it's the biggest that you could legally take 
[01:32:00]  on the plane with you.  I could pack a motherfucker like a motherfucker.  How happy does it make you feel when you get to your city, and all you have to do is  roll that luggage through the airport?  You see the sign for baggage claim, and you're like, not me today.  Bye-bye.  And you're out of there so much faster.  I grab that shit out of the overhead, and I'm like, what are you doing?  Blue Heeler from Kentucky, Carlin's bit, customer service.  Would be perfect going in a break.  How long is that?  Maybe we should play that.  Carlin always fucking- 
[01:32:30]  Customer service.  Hey.  He just fucking bites the head off the way he says it.  Disgusting.  That's from You Are All Diseased, I think.  One of his later, I'm going through all his HBO specials now, and wow, having a lot of  fun doing that.  I think You Are All Diseased is my favorite.  And that was much later on.  I want to say 99 or 2000.  One of his last.  He did a few of them after that.  He probably did three after.  Maybe two.  Okay.  I think. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, the weather guy.  So we're going to get a lot more snow on the Northeast again.  Yes.  In the Northeast.  The weather man that we highlighted yesterday, now that the video has gone viral, he's now  known as Jim Kosick, extreme weather man.  Really?  And as soon as he said his name, I'm like, oh, that guy.  I've heard that fucking guy.  See?  Now, you know his name.  He's syndicated everywhere, but he makes believe he's from your little city.  Now you know his name.  I can't-  You want to hear the latest forecast from the extreme weather man?  Please!  I can't wait until he goes too far. 
[01:33:30]  One day he'll screw up.  Oh, boy.  He'll say something naughty.  Well, now that he knows that everyone's paying attention, he's going to fuck it up.  I'm going to bet money, I haven't heard this yet, someone turn us on to this, that it's  very douchey.  He's extreme.  All right.  Let's see how extreme it is.  This is the latest forecast, right?  Because we're going to get another 12 to 15 inches.  Oh, this is today's forecast, so he's our AccuWeather man.  All right.  Snowblind, can't live without you. 
[01:34:00]  Join me if you know it, Beamer.  So fine, can't keep away, because I'm snowblind.  Isn't it?  Snowblind.  That sticks, right?  Obscure sticks.  It's a song, I think.  I know it's a song, but I couldn't tell you.  I think it sticks.  Because ain't we all?  There's more coming.  And I'm acting with our commeteorologist, Jim Kosick. 
[01:34:30]  More commeteorologist.  Did he call himself a commeteorologist?  Hopefully because of what he drinks.  I am humiliated for him.  It's good stuff, Jimmy.  You don't know good stuff.  It's not funny.  No, this is good.  It's not interesting.  He's trying so hard and failing miserably.  Yeah, yeah.  He's hoping for another hit. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You're a fucking asshole.  You're a fucking asshole.  On the South!  And it all starts this afternoon.  Time's a-wasting.  Do you have anything possibly left from the last time you went out the store?  Eh, you're going to need another 30-pack for this one here.  Starts this afternoon.  Goes right on into the nighttime hours.  And you know what?  Even though the snow's going to start tapering off during the course of the second half of Wednesday,  that's only half the story. 
[01:35:30]  50%.  Six to 12 more rickers!  And blowing and drifting.  Drifting and blowing.  Blowing, drift this and that.  Garbage can.  Garbage can?  That guy fucking stinks.  Why, man?  He's not.  Good morning.  Mackinweiler.com.  Meteorologist.  Sparkman Q.  So we are looking.  That's not the extreme weather.  This is a-  Now that's a regular weather, man.  That's just probably embarrassed to be in the business with this guy. 
[01:36:00]  He's a comm meteorologist.  Comm meteorologist.  And we'll see increasing winds leading to blowing.  This is much less entertaining.  So there you go.  Here's how the-  Here's another guy.  I can't wait until he screws up.  It's gonna snow!  Like flexicum!  Did I say that?  He'll fuck up.  He'll fuck up.  All right, well.  I despise him.  Yeah, it was a thing.  And now he's like- 
[01:36:30]  Now he's probably talking about it.  Wait, hey, did you see my-  They probably come in to watch him from other parts of the-  There goes crazy Jim Kosek.  What is he gonna do next?  Exactly.  Comm meteorologist.  That was the Baltimore forecast, and we're on satellite radio here, so maybe we should  get Jim Kosek's forecast for all the different cities.  Oh, wow.  Because Boston is here, and Lancaster, and Philadelphia, and Harrisburg, Buffalo, Albany.  From today's?  Los Angeles?  Yes.  Can we hear just-  Let's hear- 
[01:37:00]  Wait, one.  Los Angeles, nothing happens.  How is he gonna make it extreme if he's doing the L.A.  Meteorologist.  Same guy.  And this is today's forecast for L.A.  And he makes believe he's from your city.  Guys, I hate this guy.  Oh, fuck.  And enough with the-  The extreme weatherman is sponsored.  Yeah, he should be.  Oh, my God.  God.  Like Massengill or Summer's Eve.  I cannot stand web commercials.  Not enough on TV. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, how are you supposed to do a radio show?  You gotta, you know, sit through this.  How long is this?  I don't know.  It's a long commercial.  Four hours, eight minutes.  DuraCell.  Yeah.  There you go.  Copper shop.  Pay us, DuraCell.  We just gave you a fuck.  Ask on him.  You're all just working.  Q-So.  Look, we're in Q-So.  Oh, come on.  You went to Mancuso's website.  He only didn't.  He couldn't find anything extreme in L.A., so he said, fuck it.  Yeah.  So you take it.  He only deals with snow!  It's great!  He's got Boston, though, right? 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, it should be him.  Come, meteorologist.  I despise this guy.  I'm doing a commercial.  I'm lobbing.  What is this, Vince?  You can't do it, Vince.  Oh, I know her.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  She likes...  She just wants fish sticks.  I know.  Fish sticks.  Keeps her quiet.  You won't get any fish sticks.  You want some fish sticks?  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Oh, there he is.  Uh-oh.  Start from the beginning.  Our diaper drive.  Our diaper drive 2009's over. 
[01:38:30]  All right, here's the deal.  God of snow!  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!  And I would be meteorologist Jim Kosick along with Accu.com.  That storm system's rolling on in.  Oh, my God.  Coming in from the west.  Coming in from the south.  Now, this one, mucho farther north, though, than its predecessors.  We got squat, diddly, zip, zilch, goose egg, absolutely nothing from that one.  Please work on that. 
[01:39:00]  For real.  As we go to 35 degrees this afternoon, 34 on the Cape.  Hey!  Looking good there, wussy!  That, what, what, that, the, what, what, what, not that the people in Worcester are, what.  It's a, it's an abbreviation for crying out loud.  Oh, wussy.  Wussy.  Anyhow, clouds thickened tonight.  And the end result is snow coming on up the chute tomorrow.  And not just any snow.  Wind, driven, blowing, boom, boom, boom.  Kaplowy snow.  So you have the blowing and drifting, drifting and blowing, blowing and all that stuff to go on along with it. 
[01:39:30]  Three to six inches.  North and west to 128.  Six to ten elsewhere.  Highest of that, six to ten, probably down on the Cape and the south shore.  Yeah.  It will taper off to Thursday, but more blowing and drifting here.  Ooh, I like Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, because we're going to be snow blind.  Same joke.  Same joke, different city.  Can we get him on this show?  I mean, there's a lot of tension on this guy.  We should talk to him. 
[01:40:00]  He is horrible.  I'm getting so angry watching this guy.  Why is he doing this?  Do your fucking job.  You're not entertaining.  You're not an entertainer.  Really, Jimmy?  Everyone's paying attention to him.  So what?  He's viral right now.  He's trying so hard.  How about you just say funny stuff?  Yeah.  Fucking hamming it up.  Uh-oh, what's that? 
[01:40:30]  Why do I care?  I didn't turn it down.  Why does that bother me?  Ah.  It should.  No, it should.  Oh, Lancaster we got?  Yeah.  All right, well, let's listen to one more.  Let's just torture the listeners with this guy.  Lancaster.  Johnny, if you know it, Lancsy, so fine.  Lancsy.  Johnny, if you know it, Lancsy, so fine.  Can't keep away.  Because I'm snow blind.  He's doing the same thing. 
[01:41:00]  It's Lancaster, not Baltimore.  Because listen, aren't we all?  And I'm a neurologist, Jim Kosick with AccuWeather.com.  Coming on in from the west.  Oh, he's doing a great move.  Coming on in from the south.  It is indeed, yeah.  And it all starts to stop.  He's running around the set.  He's doing a little jogging.  My mother loves this guy.  I bet.  He's hysterical.  He's like, the crazy weatherman, Chip, get in here.  Seven to 14. 
[01:41:30]  Good Lord, I ain't kidding.  Itches!  Ain't it enough already?  Yeah, it is.  I don't see blood come out of his ears when he does that.  So, careful.  Starts this afternoon.  Coming down, cats and dogs throughout the course of nighttime hours.  Hey, winding down.  They're all already tomorrow.  But, you only got 50% of the story.  The other 50% is the gusty wind.  Shitty.  Unconventional.  And that creates the blowing and drifting. 
[01:42:00]  Drifting and blowing.  Blowing, drifting, drifting.  Anyhow, that'll continue into Thursday.  This is Lancaster.  And that's when we're all snow blind.  He can't even come up with something new for each city.  Sometimes my father goes away.  My mother, Leroy, goes in and helps me with the floorboards.  And she yells, like, nine inches.  So, they're doing some snow.  Oh, really?  Showcasting, too.  Poor Chip doesn't understand that somebody's fucking his mom.  Hey, watch your language.  That woman's a saint on earth.  She's a voluptuous woman. 
[01:42:30]  She has 40 B.  Her measurements.  It's 40 B's?  Yes.  Wow, that's an odd shape.  Voluptuous.  That's not quite voluptuous.  That's a fatso.  You're surrounded by fatso.  Or flatso.  What the hell's this?  We don't need any more.  I want to see more.  This guy's crazy.  Fuck this guy.  This fucking asshole.  Fucking Chip.  Asshole.  No. 
[01:43:00]  All right.  Do we have the Carlin bit going in a break?  All right.  Yes.  Is it long?  I think I do.  Yeah.  It's like a minute 30.  Oh, that's perfect.  He probably doesn't have the live version.  Let's listen to this Carlin bit on customer service.  Talked about that a little bit during this break.  And then we'll get into, well, the Michael Jackson thing.  And oh, oh, the Iran tease.  Let's talk about that next.  They're teasing.  Stay there.  Hey, Valentine's Day.

[01:52:00]  Sirius XM.  Hey, this is John Valvey.  Hey, this is Larry the Cable Dad.  Hey, folks, this is Mark Maron.  Hey, this is comedian Nick DiPoli.  What's up? This is Joe Rogan.  You are listening to the O.B. and Anthony show.  My favorite show in the history of the fucking universe.  Checking out the O.B. and Anthony show.  And we appreciate that. 
[01:52:30]  Just me in the studio right now.  Here comes Jimmy.  Here comes Anthony.  And there's Clipsota Kenny.  Other news today.  Not much here.  We all knew this was coming.  Michael Jackson's doctor charged with involuntary manslaughter.  Family's not happy, though.  What?  They want him charged with murder.  Of course they want him charged with murder.  Murder!  It was proper fall in his system, Sam.  He had on a wig.  I thought it was a white lady. 
[01:53:00]  They're not going to get the murder charge.  Fucking Michael Jackson knew exactly what was going on.  It's involuntary manslaughter.  Obviously.  It's an Elvis thing.  Elvis got those people around him to do the right thing, which was, you know, get him some drugs.  Dr. Mecopolis.  What was the famous line?  You said it earlier.  That Elvis said.  Get me what I want or I'll buy the goddamn drugstore.  Oh, damn.  Now, that's fame right there. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, he could have got whatever he wanted.  The doctor, yeah, he's been shooting him up with that shit for a while.  He's not going to think he's going to walk in the next day and he's going to be dead.  Murder's intentional.  Pretty fucked up, though.  Propofol at your house?  God damn.  I don't think he's going to be able to practice medicine anymore.  I think they might yank that little license away.  And they'll probably give him something.  Three years.  Yeah, maybe something like that. 
[01:54:00]  He didn't mean to kill him.  That's just it.  They've got to argue that.  Of course he didn't mean to kill him.  He lost a payday.  He did.  And his practice.  Why would he kill the guy?  He should say it like that, too.  I didn't mean to kill him.  I lost a payday.  Of course.  And my practice.  What about me?  Well, that's what it comes down to.  You don't give a shit.  It's my meal ticket.  And this Charlie Sheen, charged with felony menacing, assault, and criminal mischief.  They're not dropping this fucking record.  He's got some fucking record and some kind of something going on. 
[01:54:30]  And he's got one of the hottest shows in America.  He's got some type of anger problem.  I love him.  Definitely an anger and rage problem.  Yeah.  Must be from growing up and being one of those Brat Packers.  And one of his cars just goes over the cliff and we don't know why.  A stolen car.  Or who did it.  It's really mysterious.  What the fuck's that about?  Seems a little fishy.  Seems like someone was really pissed off at Charlie Sheen and went, oh yeah, look what I do to you now.  Here's what I do to you now. 
[01:55:00]  Here's the story about the latest charges.  Actor Charlie Sheen is officially charged in a Christmas Day incident during which he allegedly held a knife to his wife's throat.  Sheen is facing charges of felony menacing, third degree assault, and criminal mischief.  He did not enter a plea in court yesterday.  The judge allowed the restraining order to be modified so the couple could have contact for the sake of their twin baby boys.  What a guy.  So he's just a minister with a knife?  Wow, that's a little hardcore. 
[01:55:30]  Charged her with nagging.  She was charged with nagging and serving cold spaghetti.  She enticed me.  She enticed me.  Who's his wife?  Some brud.  Some brud?  I can't keep up anymore.  Is she good looking?  Good looking.  She's no Denise Richards.  He had problems with that Denise Richards.  Oh, they have a volatile little relationship.  She seems like she has her own issues. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  The latest one's not bad at all.  What's going on?  I don't know.  Like, you see all the pictures of the red carpet and them two, and they're hugging and they're walking in, holding hands.  You just start to picture them in their nice house, just him with a knife holding it to her throat.  What's he going to do with the red carpet?  Kick her in the cunt as he's talking to us weekly?  Well, that's some move there, Charlie.  Imagine that he's on E.T. chit-chatting, and all of a sudden she walks over and he sidekicks her in the fucking sternum. 
[01:56:30]  I'm talking, bitch.  You know, you make a good boy.  God damn.  Yeah, it continues with him.  Yeah, he's got to, he's a problem guy that it doesn't seem to affect his career.  That's what I don't understand.  Like, there are people like that friggin' Robert Downey Jr. before he got this Iron Man shit and a few of the other movies. 
[01:57:00]  Like, he went through a period of time where his volatility definitely affected his career.  Oh, yeah.  He was like, they weren't hiring him for acting.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was it.  He turned it all around.  And there are plenty of other actors that just lose work and don't recover from it because of their private life.  Fucking, this guy can do whatever he wants.  He's punching chicks.  He's doing drugs.  And then he's on the hottest show on television.  That stinks.  I'm sorry.  It probably doesn't affect his work.  Like, with Robert Downey Jr., it probably affected him showing up on the set and they were probably losing money. 
[01:57:30]  With Charlie Sheen, they're probably not losing money because of his stuff.  No.  Continuity problems with his knuckles all busted up in one episode.  He just scratches on his face and then they're gone.  He has funny cut.  His right hand's all swollen.  He seems to be slipping, though.  I don't think he's going to be able to keep it together.  Yeah, hold it together?  I think this is going to turn out real ugly. 
[01:58:00]  The stitches are getting a little tight.  Nah, he's slipping.  I don't think he's...  He's having a tough time holding it all together, I'm thinking.  Oh, yeah.  Getting a big jaw.  He's getting like one of those...  What's his name from, uh...  What?  Fucking mask?  Yeah, yeah.  He's got a Rocky Dennis jaw.  A little Rocky Dennis action?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  John from Bayville writes this.  He goes,  It's because of Martin Sheen is so well-respected.  Oh, is that it?  Martin Sheen has, uh...  Well, Martin Sheen's just crazy. 
[01:58:30]  He likes to...  Martin Sheen is.  He likes to chain himself to stuff.  Yeah, in the old days, the no-nukes days.  He's not into that as much?  I've chained myself to a nuclear rocket.  What are you doing?  He didn't annoy me, though, because I thought he was very sincere.  He just...  That was just what he did.  Sincere in his dumb shittedness.  I didn't mind him.  I love Martin Sheen.  Um, you know...  Eleanor's an actor.  I think he's very good.  Yeah, of course he is.  Just saw The Departed again the other day.  Isn't he great?  Let me tell you something.  The Departed gets better the more you watch it.  I gotta say, you know something? 
[01:59:00]  I watched it.  The first time I watched it, you expect so much from Martin Scorsese.  You really do.  Yeah.  That you watch it and kind of go like, meh.  And the first thing that comes to mind is, yo, Casino, Goodfellas, Raging Bull, blah, blah, blah.  But then the more you watch it, it's like, you know, this is a good fucking movie.  I think it's a good movie.  Martin Sheen has this gift to play regular people.  And I guess all actors do.  But he can make such regular people interesting.  It's like what he did in The Departed. 
[01:59:30]  I thought he was the best thing in the movie.  Yeah, he was really, really good.  As a simple man.  He was just fucking rules, man.  That's the guy doing his job.  Doing the jab.  Yep.  He takes a swan dive off the roof.  He certainly did.  Adios, Estevez.  He just spoiled the movie.  Oh, well.  It's a 1958 production.  Don't blow.  Hey, we started this as a joke, but it's real.  All that Colts gear is going to Haiti.  Oh, yeah.  For real.  It's going to Haiti.  The Super Bowl champion Colts shirts. 
[02:00:00]  Yep.  Now, last year, the Cardinals gear, just to keep up, who lost the Super Bowl last year, right?  Uh, their stuff was donated to El Salvador.  Ah.  And in 2008, the Patriots apparel for Super Bowl, uh, whatever.  I don't know Roman numerals.  Uh, where do you think they went?  X, X, X, X.  Nicaragua.  Nick and D.  Nicaragua.  Nicaragua.  Nicaragua.  Nicaragua.  As they say.  Uh, who says like that?  Mars, right?  Nicaragua.  Nicaragua.  Nicaragua. 
[02:00:30]  Nicaragua.  Wait, where's Mars?  He said it like that one day.  Mars?  We were talking about Nicaragua.  And then Mars went, Nicaragua.  How do you say it?  No, it's Nicaragua.  N-  N-  N-  N-  N-  N-  Mars.  Ha ha ha.  You're a foreigner.  Nicaragua.  And he also had some-  N-  N-  N-  Say that again.  And also-  Don't fuck with me, Tony.  He has a lot to add to this show today.  There's something else he wants to add.  Yes.  Yes, go ahead.  Just say the fucking country again.  Nicaragua.  N-  N-  N-  N-  N-  N-  If you say it like that, you should have like a boonie hat on and a fucking AK-47 walking through the woods. 
[02:01:00]  I love the montage of Scarface of Tony and Mr. Sosa laughing.  Yeah.  Like, what are they laughing at?  You know someone was dead.  Probably some horrible fucking-  I cut his fucking head off, Tony.  And then I put his balls in his mouth.  Yes.  And his wig was so big, I couldn't even leap over it, Tony.  Ha ha.  Oh, Sosa, do you notice that I have perfect fake teeth in this scene? 
[02:01:30]  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  And just laughing.  I bet you're, take it to the limit.  Ha ha ha ha ha.  Chuckling.  Tony, look at your shoes, Tony.  Ha ha ha ha.  Yeah.  Big lift.  Yes, you almost bumped your head on the helicopter when we were hanging Omar out of it.  Ha ha ha.  With your giant shoes.  Ha ha ha.  Oh, look, you're shaking hands.  Yeah.  The tiger is running.  Don't worry, all those bags aren't money. 
[02:02:00]  A few of them are weird.  Yes.  Ha ha ha.  Actually, one wigs.  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha.  Yeah.  Yeah, it looks like Chippy Pop popcorn on the head.  That's right, folks.  Same bit.  Again.  Ha ha ha ha.  It never stops.  Now that an opening shitty Gina and her awful Paul Stanley hairdo.  Yeah.  Hey, I want to be your first customer.  I'll leave my wig here.  I'll pick it up at three.  Yeah.  Looks like Marge Simpson's, but it's dark.  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  And fucking Manny's awful shirt. 
[02:02:30]  Ha ha ha.  The money's being counted.  Yeah.  I'll push it to the limit.  All right.  Oh, here they come with their bags and money bringing it to the bank.  And the nervous banker's looking around like, how am I going to wander all this?  What banker just stands in the window watching?  Watching.  Where's his boss?  Exactly.  What the fuck are you doing?  You're laundering money.  Tony's a dance.  A fucking dance.  A gaudy cubit.  He's got the fucking tiger in his own house.  I got a tiger.  And I got the big globe. 
[02:03:00]  And a fountain in my lobby.  That I fall into.  A montage.  A big wedding montage scene.  Yeah.  Getting married.  And Gina looks on lovingly.  Yeah.  And Manolo.  Her rotten hairdo makes me sick.  And helmet hair.  That is awful.  Yeah.  Go on.  Fuck me, Tony.  Looks like Anthony in Rot Guts.  That's great.  Jesus.  So her just split guts.  That's what happens to her. 
[02:03:30]  Get it?  She gets killed.  Oh, look.  They're all walking out.  Look at the tiger.  Their wedding outfits.  But Tony can't walk on those lifts.  Yeah, he can.  Look, I got my cigar.  I'm walking 30 miles an hour down the hill because my lips are made of steel, Manolo.  I need a fireproof wig.  This cigar sets it on fire.  Yeah.  Fly pelicans.  Look at my tiger.  I get a full five feet of chain.  Can you hear the roar now?  It's like, help him out.  The awful picture of him and her in the chair. 
[02:04:00]  Yes.  I want that over my fireplace.  His dumb incompetent sister has her own business, but she's fucking running into the ground.  She's too busy peeling back Manny's foreskin.  And his fucking, his new wife is fucking, is doing coke, even though fucking Scarface murdered her husband.  What a cunt.  How warm and so polluted.  Polluted.  He drinks a little coke.  Smoking.  How many addictions can be in this montage scene?  She's playing blackjack.  Yeah.  Smoking, drinking, gambling. 
[02:04:30]  Fucking sucking.  Blackjack.  Blackjack.  That wasn't even the one with them smiling, by the way.  No, no, they didn't show the montage of them smiling.  I love them smiling at each other.  Just laughing over a joke.  There's probably some silly joke, too.  Oh, I'm sure.  It sucked.  Like, what's black and white and red all over?  I don't know.  And newspaper, Tony.  Fuck.  Did you see March of the Penguins?  Ah, there he is.  Ah, they're on the wrong lap. 
[02:05:00]  And Tony's pointing and making a joke.  And what?  Money's being counted.  Yes.  And now we got children doing it, Mr. Sosa.  Oh, look at him.  Ah, ha, ha, ha.  Threws his head back laughing.  And his awful fucking fake teeth in this.  Money's being counted.  I love the fact that Tony's pointing in mid-story.  And then, I tried to fuck my sister, Mr. Sosa.  Oh, Tony.  I understand that, Tony.  She's lovely.  Ah, shit. 
[02:05:30]  If her bush is like her head.  She's lovely.  We like that down here.  How did you get the cocaine into the country, Tony?  Ah, just put it in my lips and my wig.  Lift the wig.  Actually able to bring more than I thought.  I can't stop doing lift and wig jokes.  And Sam just keeps replaying the laughing part of the montage.  It's the fucking best part of the movie.  The laughing part.  The laughing part of the montage.  That's a satellite phone being listened to by the U.S. government. 
[02:06:00]  I know.  Bad jokes being taped.  Sosa's phone is plugged into a fucking case.  To this 1983.  They don't notice that the fucking, the one through six are missing in the clock.  I know.  What the fuck?  Idiotony.  One through six.  It's actually just an FBI agent's face with numbers surrounding it.  How do you not see that's a clock?  He's got hands taped to his nose.  It doesn't move.  Yeah, and he's shotting down things.  Why is there wall riding, Manolo? 
[02:06:30]  Sidon Bob's a good guy.  Ah, shit.  That's fantastic.  Oh, I love the laugh.  The open collar.  And Tony's horrible fucking white shirt open to mid-stomach.  Of course, he's Cuban.  And his teeth are way too white.  They're uncomfortably bleached white in that scene.  I'm all the coke.  Goddamn, the movie is a classic.  Yes.  I must say.  Gotta watch it every time.  Just laughing, having fun.  Selling drugs, killing people.  It's wonderful.  I never trusted him.  And he points at the sky where he used to be. 
[02:07:00]  The last place he saw him.  I never trusted him.  That son of a bitch.  Yeah, he's pointing to you with a helicopter.  Helicopter's gone.  Helicopter's gone.  That's what they're laughing at.  Yes.  Do you remember he shit his pants when he fell out of the helicopter?  I knew that would happen, Tony.  I hung many people, Tony, from the helicopter.  Don't ever fuck me, Tony.  Yeah, that couldn't have been something that, like, it was a first-time deal.  No. 
[02:07:30]  Because it wasn't like he just kind of gave a nod and they knew what to do.  It wasn't like he had to go, look, I want you to hang him from the helicopter.  Yeah.  What?  No, no.  Get it raw.  And the helicopter.  They just know.  They did that before.  And what would happen is they tried to do it to Tony, but they threw him out and his  lifts just hit the ground gently.  He's so tall.  Yeah.  I can't believe I'm horseshoe bald.  The helicopter knocked a wig off.  It was two things.  Yeah, he wasn't that high off the ground because of his lifts and his wig puffed up like a 
[02:08:00]  parachute.  So, he had a backup system.  We're really doing a show for two people.  I know.  I just can't help it.  That's a fucking montage.  That's there for you to check out.  Yeah.  To the limit.  We're going to have Roy Jones Jr. in minutes.  Oh.  He's early.  Is he?  Yeah, I think we can squeeze the Bobo thing in the...  What?  He did a promo for his stand-up gig? 
[02:08:30]  Oh, God.  E-Rock is saying this is really fucking funny.  So, I'm like, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right.  You mean, AKA the virus?  Oh, boy.  Did we take the chance with this?  E-Rock says this is really funny.  All right.  Now, the only thing that it's got going for it is that Bobo's...  And Bobo usually says really stupid stuff.  But E-Rock...  I don't know how well a judge of comedy E-Rock...  I'm reading the little thing here.  It says, Bobo gives direction to Derek D-Boy, the man that hates Lionsgate. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  And then tries to record a promo for his upcoming gig, which he's not supposed to promote yet.  Yeah.  So, why don't we at least give this a shot and see what happens?  Is it possible you could put something Beastie Boy-ish in the background?  You want something Beastie Boy-ish?  Yeah, yeah, like some kind of Beastie Boys beat, like, in the background of this promo.  Yeah, any preferences?  Is a fight for your right good one?  Good one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think fight for your right is great. 
[02:09:30]  Okay.  I'm either thinking fight for the right or to the five boroughs.  Actually, that one, to the five boroughs.  Okay.  If you could somehow use that beat in the background of the promo, that'd be great.  What do you think D-Boy's thinking right now?  Well, uh, I'm taping this, so at least we'll have it.  Right.  Uh, if not, I would have told him to go fuck himself.  I know what I'm doing.  Of course.  Don't fuck with my production.  I told you a long time ago not to fuck with me, you chewed up little dick Tony. 
[02:10:00]  I would love that.  All right.  I'm ready.  Hey, this is Bobo from the O.B. and Anthony show.  Hold on.  You got to talk into the mic.  All right.  You go.  Right here.  You go.  You want to sit down?  All right.  All right.  Hey, what's up there?  This is Bobo from the O.B. and Anthony show, and I'll be performing at O'Brien's Ale House 
[02:10:30]  in February, at February, oh, wait a minute, let me start this over.  Hey, what's up?  This is, hey, what's up?  This is Bobo from the O.B. and Anthony show.  I'll be, I'll be performing on February 14th.  Wait, wait, wait a minute.  I messed it up.  Hey, what's up there?  This is Bobo from the O.B. and Anthony show, and I'll be doing my stand-up gig on February  14th at O'Brien's Ale House in Quorum, New York, at 8 p.m. 
[02:11:00]  This is one show only.  I'll be opening for my good friend Mursh, fellow ONA fan.  Oh, wait a minute.  I messed it up on.  Hey, what's up there?  This is Bobo from the O.B. and Anthony show.  Where is this dog accent of yours coming from?  What, what's it, what's like, yo, well, I want to sound like I'm kind of, you know, I'm  a fool, I'm a, you know what I mean, right?  Yeah.  I just kind of like to say, like, like, what's up, like, I'm kind of, like, I'm kind of talking 
[02:11:30]  to the, to these people, right?  Okay.  You know what I mean?  Because I'm just, I'm trying to talk to the people on, like, I'm talking, like, I'm talking  with them, like, like, I'm trying, I'm trying to, I'm trying to give, like, you know, like,  like a, like a right approach, right?  Yeah.  Like, I'm talking, like, I'm greeting the person, right?  Like, I'm trying to be, like, a friendly face.  Hey, yo, what's up?  This is Bobo for the O.B. and Anthony show, and I'll be, and I'll be performing at O'Brien's  Ale House on February 14th in Quorum, New York. 
[02:12:00]  Be sure to, be sure to bring your, be sure to bring your girlfriend with you, and if  you don't have a date, no problem with that.  I'm cool with that.  It'll be, I'll be opening for my fellow ONA fan, Mersh, good friend of mine, and he'll  be recording his CD, Killjoy, available this March.  For ticket info, call up my buddy, Mersh, and leave a message at 910.  Bro, and be sure to let him know you are interested in purchasing tickets. 
[02:12:30]  They are $7 in advance, and if you want to pay at the door, if tickets are available,  that'll be $10.  And remember, for all gifts, peace out.  Is that good?  You like that?  He'd rather go to a Lionsgate film festival than deal with that.  Deal with his shenanigans. 
[02:13:00]  That was alright.  I don't think it was like, gonna fucking set the show on fire, E-Rock.  Huh?  I mean, E-Rock came in here like gangbusters.  Yeah, he really was excited about me.  Did you have E-Rock explain why that's so good?  Yeah, I think so.  Where is E-Rock?  It was good.  I'm glad Derek did it.  He points there, he's like, make sure you get to this.  Make sure you get to this.  He actually told you to put all your other stuff aside and make sure you get to this  right away.  He sure did.  Roy is early?  Yeah, he should be here.  Or is he going to be here?  I heard he would be here by nine. 
[02:13:30]  He may be early, so he's on his way now, could be here by nine.  Okay.  I like Bobo's technique of how he just said he's talking to the people.  Yeah.  Like, he wanted it to come off natural.  Where did he get that?  Like, where does he...  I mean, he's a man of the people, so he kind of just says, okay, I'll take my radio voice  down a notch.  Because it's not like he's reading something, he just wanted to do it like, you know, hey  man, come on out, come see Bobo.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  Iraq, why was that good?  It was funny when he was recording it. 
[02:14:00]  I think you're downplaying it a little bit.  Oh!  Whoa!  Obviously, you don't understand humor.  Somebody doesn't know radio.  I explain why that was so great to play for everybody.  That's all.  I'm not even saying if you're right or wrong.  Okay.  Well, it's not even great when we have him in every Friday, but the fact is the new Bobo  material looks like the student is becoming the teacher.  Oh, young Padawan, what are you doing? 
[02:14:30]  Look at you.  You don't like when Bobo's on every Friday?  No.  Sometimes it's too much.  Maybe letting the hosts know what they should do.  This is crazy here.  Sometimes it's too much.  Why is it too much?  It's just, it is.  Sometimes.  Not a Bobo fan?  No.  Maybe Friday.  You made a lot of fans today.  A lot of people are going to like you, E-Rod.  But the fact that he, that he's so full of himself now that he's slipping into, um, he's  slipping into characters while just trying to do a simple comic promo for an event I 
[02:15:00]  don't even think is really happening, where he, he's just annoying, Derek is sitting there  stressed with his hands in his head, just like, I fucking hate this guy, and he's trying  to pull off this, yo, I'm a, I'm a Brooklyn tough guy kind of thing.  Yeah, now, but did you notice, uh, Friday, when those girls came in and, and Bobo was  in here, uh, you don't think that was good radio?  Eric not only did not think that was good radio, but he refused to put it on the worst  of the week countdown.  That didn't make the worst of the week countdown.  He refused.  Some of the lines that, uh, Bobo was saying were, it was classic. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, but the overall bit of the girls just yapping and everything was really just too  much.  Yeah.  And Bobo's had better appearances, so I didn't put it in.  Not this week, not that week.  What was number one?  What was number one?  Uh, number one was Larry King, uh, movie lines.  Ah, yeah.  Number two was Steve's favorite.  Steve's favorite.  Yeah, that was, uh, that was a classic.  That's a very hard one to pick one and two right there.  But still, I mean, there's, there's ten spots on there, and Bobo didn't even make it. 
[02:16:00]  Bobo didn't even make ten.  You would think he would, he would have been ten.  I want to know what tenth was that, that Bobo didn't make it in, but something did.  I think we had eight this week.  Anthony's Pot Stories was, uh, towards the top of the list.  Oh, okay.  That was great.  Thank you.  That was fun.  Eight, I think, was, uh, I think it was Matt from Rotten Tomatoes.  Beat out Bobo.  Just talking movies?  Movie talk?  Yeah.  Yeah.  When is this countdown?  I should listen to this.  It's actually all weekend long.  Oh, really?  If you, uh, if you just tune in 202 or 197, you'll hear it. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, dude, let me tell you.  When did we start this?  Actually, uh, several months ago.  Oh, really?  Like, many months ago.  Like, before the summer.  Yeah.  Like, an actual countdown, we do that now?  Mm-hmm.  Yes.  Where E-Rock and me count down the top bits of the week.  Oh, I gotta check that out.  It's a good, it's good.  I mean, it's...  I should check that out.  Actually, I had a lot of time to develop, so now it might be a...  It's been on for so long.  Is this true, E-Rock?  10 was a Steven Singer read.  Is that what Cigars and Scotch is saying? 
[02:17:00]  A Steven Singer read.  Enough of that Steven Singer.  Jesus.  Teach him out.  Enough already.  There is a special read for the weekend that me, Kenny, and E-Rock did for Steven Singer.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I actually heard that yesterday.  Yeah?  I think so.  I think I actually heard it during the Rana Fez show.  I think they're running on Rana Fez, the replay of this show, and the worst of the week countdown.  Yeah, they're just riffing and hanging together, talking about Steven Singer.  You know what is amazing?  I never understood the concept, when he first came on board, of IHateStevenSinger.com, the website. 
[02:17:30]  Now, after, you know, as we come up towards Valentine's Day on a daily basis, I completely understand the name of the website.  IHateStevenSinger.com.  After Valentine's Day, I hope we never hear from that fucking guy again.  Damn.  Take your dumb roses and beat it.  Yeah.  Hit the bricks.  Hit the bricks, Steven.  The next time I see Steven Singer's name, I want to see The Wake Four will be held out.  With a little arrow to the right. 
[02:18:00]  Yes.  Yeah.  Here's your gold rose, you corpse.  Yeah.  Clunk him on the head with it.  Yeah.  Celebrating two years in heaven.  Boy, is that some morbid reading.  What the fuck?  Why does that have to be in the paper?  I know, right?  Happy birthday in heaven.  Your fifth birthday in heaven.  Fifth birthday in heaven.  Happy birthday.  Love, Mommy, Daddy, and Uncle Paul.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who found you. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  Bleeding from the buttocks.  Yeah, must have had an accident.  Hey.  Poor little fella.  Fell on a candle hold.  Yeah.  Like Little Teddy.  Ha ha ha.  Oh, no.  Shoot.  Horrible story.  A little Teddy.  Yeah.  A little Teddy Junior.  Yeah.  He tumbled onto it.  Oh, poor fella.  He was stuck in there.  Poor little fella.  Put him in a chew box.  Should we check with E-Rock to make sure this segment is going okay?  Is this all right?  E-Rock, show today, overall grade?  Show is doing very well. 
[02:19:00]  All right.  Thank you.  Your standard A through F grading system.  What would you give today?  I'd give today an A.  Oh, you wouldn't.  No, you wouldn't.  Where's your favorite part?  That shirt is very slimming, I noticed.  Slimming?  Yeah, because it has the white on the sides.  It's a golf shirt.  It's a golf.  You don't play golf.  It's a golf.  I just get a lot of golf clothes.  Kyle in Kansas has something.  Kyle.  Good evening.  Hey.  Hey, I'd just like to know how Bobo thinks that two Beastie Boys songs are Beastie Boys-ish. 
[02:19:30]  That's a very good point.  Oh, yeah, I agree with this.  Corinne in Jersey has a good point.  Corinne?  Yeah, I'm thinking that maybe you guys should do less Bobo and more virus.  Maybe that's what Iraq was getting at.  Oh, maybe Iraq was coming.  That's right.  Iraq, could you please leave the studio and come back as the virus?  Yeah.  I mean, you're all about how Bobo sucks and he shouldn't be on our show every Friday. 
[02:20:00]  This should bring it up to A-plus, by the way.  Right.  What are we going to do with the virus today?  What should we do?  One punchline.  Yeah, one punchline.  Or we could always do the, he looked like he was struggling like the virus does when I  asked him what his favorite segment of today's show is.  Yep.  Which means he might not have been listening very carefully.  Where's the virus's music?  Ladies and gentlemen, coming into the studio, the virus, everyone.  Hi, virus.  Hi, guys.  How you doing, virus? 
[02:20:30]  Virus?  Just fine.  Do you like today's show, virus?  Oh, yes, but there's really no need for this segment.  Oh, there certainly is.  There's plenty of need.  What's your favorite part of the show so far today?  And why?  I like the segment on Charlie Sheen going back into Al Pacino impressions. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, what?  Yeah.  It just happened.  Yeah, yeah.  That just...  Doesn't mean it wasn't funny.  That means you only listened to the last 15 minutes of the show.  Yeah.  Yes.  Anyone knows it's funny.  Yeah.  Ah, the virus and a little Steve.  You want to give us a punchline today?  There's a lot of stuff going on in the news.  Got Super Bowl humor.  You got the Brad and Angelina rumor possibly not being true.  You got Michael Jackson's doctor facing murder charges involuntary. 
[02:21:30]  That airplane story you'd think would be right with punchline.  That airplane story with the fucking two pot cookies is pretty damn impressive.  What do you got?  One punchline for the virus.  One.  Start with, did you hear about, and at least get a subject out there for the people.  Let's go, virus.  One punchline. 
[02:22:00]  That's not what the virus sounds like.  Uh-huh.  Shit.  We got to sneak it in.  We could.  Yeah, we got a big star.  We have a guest coming in here.  Well, don't let me keep you from them.  Well, that's not...  Oh, wow.  Well, hey, you know something?  Well, no, that's not a punchline, but it's a smart-ass funny remark.  That's more smart-ass than funny. 
[02:22:30]  We're looking for a genuine punchline from the virus.  At least give us a subject.  Don't let me keep you from that either.  Look at our prep sheet.  Give us a subject and go, did you hear about, and then maybe something will come to you.  Give it a try.  It might just work.  Did you hear about Michael Jackson's doctor charged with manslaughter?  No, we haven't, virus. 
[02:23:00]  Maybe I shouldn't have picked that one.  All right, pick another one.  Do the setup, and maybe something will come to you.  Here comes the virus with one punchline.  Do the did-you-hear part.  I'm telling you, it could work.  Did you hear about the Super Bowl champion culture getting sent to Haiti? 
[02:23:30]  Yes.  Yes, we did, virus.  All right, that one's not helping either.  One lousy punchline.  Try one more.  Try one more setup.  See what comes to mind.  Quickly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do the setup and see if something comes. 
[02:24:00]  Did you hear?  Did you hear Governor Patterson denied sex and drug rumors?  Yeah, we're hearing that today, virus.  Yeah, me too. 
[02:24:30]  That's not a punchline.  Come on, virus, one punchline.  We've got to take a break and get Roy Jones Jr. in here.  He's bringing him in.  Are we taking a break?  Did you want to take a break?  Do we need one?  We can if you want.  All right, no, we're not going to take a break.  Come on, virus, before Roy Jones Jr. gets here.  One punchline.  How about one attempt at a punchline?  One punchline.  All right. 
[02:25:00]  Did you hear the Super Bowl champion cold shirts got sent to Haiti?  Yes.  Yeah, we heard that this morning.  Three, two, one.  Well, I guess.  Just go with it.  All right.  Well, I guess Opie and Anthony's homeless shopping spree shirts weren't enough.  Get out.  All right.  Get out.  One punchline is all I want.  There's a helicopter waiting for you. 
[02:25:30]  Imagine you throw him out.  The fucking whole helicopter comes crashing down.  His fat neck is fine.  He has a little red mark on his fat neck.  He's fucking so pissed.  He should be pissed.  He gets so pissed.  And God and his lack of wit.  That is so goddamn money.  He just gets so fucking pissed.  There's a helicopter waiting for you.  You come back tomorrow.  Yeah, sure.  When he's supposed to go.  Yeah.  It's like there's a helicopter waiting.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He kept it.  Make the deal.  Leave pony with us.  Leave pony here.  We will talk about.  Can we take a short break? 
[02:26:00]  Because I don't know where he is, man.  And he's early anyway.  I wouldn't mind a quick leak.  Travis, can we do a quick break?  You sure can.  Do they know it?  Do they walk him down or no?  It's fine.  He was supposed to be here at 9.30.  It's cool.  Do a quick break.  We won't do a double.  And we'll talk to Roy Jones Jr. next.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Wow, how cool is this?  Roy Jones Jr. in studio. 
[02:26:30]  What happened?  Nothing.  I apparently got confused during the end of my last live reads.  When I said the phone number and then the website.  And I started saying the website to a different product.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That happened.  Because they're all mixed up in my head now.  All right, great.  Oh, very cool.  So, Roy Jones Jr. in studio and we couldn't be happier.  One of the greatest fighters ever.  I mean, I know you probably get sick of hearing that.  But, I mean, if you want to really be entertained watching, you make fighting look fun. 
[02:27:00]  It is fun.  When I'm doing it to my best, it is fun.  And I don't get tired of hearing one of the best fighters ever.  That's a beautiful thing.  And I thank God for blessing me with the abilities that enable people to label me as such a thing.  The abilities to beat the shit out of somebody.  That's Teddy Teal Up.  That is fantastic.  But you make it look like watching you, it's obviously a tremendously difficult sport.  But it's like, I really wish I could do that. 
[02:27:30]  Because you don't just hit people.  You really seem to enjoy taunting the opponent.  Well, see, the reason I started boxing was because I watched Muhammad Ali use his brain and his taunting ability to totally dismantle Joe Frazier.  I said, if somebody teaches me how to throw my hands, I can use my brain to do that.  And if you think about it, that's what I do.  So you think Frazier kind of was beaten mentally by Ali before?  Oh, yeah.  He was.  He was.  He's still mad about it now.  Yeah, we had him in.  He really is just not happy.  He really can hold a grudge. 
[02:28:00]  Exactly.  But see, and that's a good thing.  That's what made Joe.  You know what I'm saying?  That's what made Joe.  Joe wasn't supposed to be Muhammad Ali.  He was supposed to be Joe.  And that's a guy who holds a grudge for life.  And that's what kept him coming so much to everybody.  So that's a beautiful thing, too.  But my side of it was the other side.  So, like, Bernard Hopkins probably holds a grudge with me still.  But my side is the other side.  You can hold all the grudge you want.  You still can't beat me.  If Joe had not held such a grudge, it could have been the Joe Frazier grill. 
[02:28:30]  And he would have been the guy making all the money.  But it didn't happen that way.  It's amazing how a guy like Foreman, who is this feared guy and this just terrifying figure,  goes through his thing after he loses and comes out this friendly, fun guy.  Well, thank you.  But, well, well, as you're speaking, people don't like to hear it.  But it's the truth.  It's what the power of God can do.  Because he went and found God and came back and made more money than he ever dreamed of making  when he was this fearsome guy that everybody was afraid of.  Did you find him inspirational?  Because you're a guy, I mean, you've been fighting since 89 professionally. 
[02:29:00]  You have a long career.  And it's rare that fighters go 21 years and are still really viable fighters.  And when he fought Holyfield, I mean, that was like he said,  for anybody in their 40s, this is a victory.  Man, he totally, totally amazed me.  Totally made me realize that just because they say you're old don't mean you're old.  Only God can make that call.  And Foreman was one of my first or really my second examples of that.  So you, what motivates, I mean, obviously you want to win a fight, but you're a very quiet, nice guy.  And everybody who's met you that I've spoken to has said, oh, he's the nicest guy. 
[02:29:30]  But when you get in the ring, it really, it's not, it's, what motivates you to like taunt the opponents?  And I like that because is it to show for the people or is it to make them so angry they make mistakes?  Well, it's both.  It's strictly, it's, you hit the nail on the head.  It's a show for the people, first of all, because people pay to watch me fight.  I don't want to just watch a boxing match.  I want them to see Roy.  I want them to see something that they're going to remember for the rest of their lives.  Secondly, though, it's also to make the guy try to kill you.  And when they try to kill you, they make mistakes. 
[02:30:00]  Kind of like the Rumble, the Fight in Zaire when Ali was taunting.  He was taunting Foreman, which is common knowledge now.  He didn't give a shipping out of him.  He's going, that doesn't hurt.  That's all you got.  Which really is a brave strategy.  Very brave, but a caution in the long run.  It didn't work out for him, but to allow Foreman to hit you, to say, I'm going to let Foreman just punch me until he's tired.  George Foreman at that, I mean, wow.  Yeah, no kidding.  I mean, you got to think about George.  George is a guy, like I said, that had God on him all his life and didn't know it. 
[02:30:30]  Anytime, back in those days, you can start amateur boxing in one year and make it to the Olympics.  And not only just make it to the Olympics, win a gold medal in one year.  That was unheard of back then.  Sure.  Nowadays, it's accepted because not as many people are in boxing, boxing, the skill level has dropped.  That's why people like myself and Bernard Hopkins can still stay around and dominate the division because the skill level has dropped a little bit.  So we can make it last longer, stretch our careers a little longer.  But back then, oh, no.  Why do you think the skill level has dropped a little bit?  Because so many people are into so many other things now. 
[02:31:00]  You know, you got the MMA now.  That is a whole different animal.  You know, you see guys in MMA that have wrestling backgrounds, karate backgrounds, all type of different backgrounds.  And they can come in a couple of years and become a great MMA fighter.  A boxer, if he didn't start when he was a little kid and stay in it, he ain't going to make it.  Yeah, boxing seems to me because MMA is a very fierce sport.  And I love it.  Yeah, I do too.  Don't get me wrong, I love it.  Didn't you want to be involved in that in some way?  I did.  I tried to.  I did a fight where I did a boxing show and an MMA show because I feel like any man that's got the galls to go out and face another man one-on-one, I don't care what kind of sport it is, I love you for that. 
[02:31:30]  So you wanted to fight.  Who did you want to fight?  You wanted to fight Silva?  No, he wanted to fight me in a boxing match.  And we're still talking about that.  I think he still wants to fight me in a boxing match.  You would kill him.  Well, he don't really see.  But he's a great MMA fighter.  He actually, when I watch him fight, he also inspires me because he goes out and uses what I do in regular boxing.  He does it in the MMA.  And he makes his fans have a truly entertaining night.  They don't just see a fight.  They get to be entertained.  But it's also, you know, you can't just take an MMA guy and put boxing gloves on him and say, now you just got to adhere to all the boxing rules. 
[02:32:00]  Just like you can't take a boxer, throw him in an MMA ring and expect him to perform and win.  It's too different.  You're talking about two different things.  You are, but he does have a boxing background.  He does?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's had some boxing matches.  You would still kill him.  I'm going to beat him.  You would still kill him.  But he's also a lot bigger than me.  So he'd have his advantages, too.  But I think I'd beat him.  But we'll have to see.  Hey, I want to go back to Foreman for a second. 
[02:32:30]  Do you think he's one of the greatest ever?  Heavyweights?  Yes, I do.  And I'm going to say that because the reason I say one of the greatest ever is because, first of all, the first miracle, I always relate to him as a modern-day Samson.  The first miracle is back in those days, I don't care what you tell nobody, I was an amateur boxer.  Even in my time, nobody boxed for one year and made it to the Olympics.  It wasn't happening, let alone win a gold medal.  You weren't going to make it to the National Golden Gloves boxing one year.  I can't think of nobody in my time when I was an amateur that started boxing for one year and made it to a national tournament in their first year. 
[02:33:00]  I can't think of nobody that I know.  That's amazing.  Let alone win the National Tournament and win the Olympics in one year.  Wow.  So, I mean, you can't take that away from him.  He wasn't blessed with the skill level that myself or Muhammad Ali or Shiaway Robinson or somebody like that had or Shiaway Leonard.  But he still was a phenomenon.  Look at him.  And then at 40-something years old, come back and regain the heavyweight championship of the world.  Well, you're trying to figure out how old he was.  I think he was 44.  I'm not sure. 
[02:33:30]  44-ish?  Yeah, I think he was 44.  Yeah, that's about right, huh?  And greatest heavyweight of all time in your eyes.  Because we argue this all the time.  The greatest heavyweight of all time has to be Muhammad Ali because not only for what he did inside the ring.  What he did outside.  But also what he did outside the ring.  And still right now, although he's in the situation he's in, he's still been nothing but a protocol type of a humanitarian.  It's so tough to look at him, man.  It's so tough to see him on TV.  But it's hard to still.  Yeah, I understand.  He's all there.  He just can't communicate.  It's hard to still.  It's brutal when you see those old clips of Ali doing his thing and now what he's become. 
[02:34:00]  It's heartbreaking.  Well, you've got to remember, though, we all go through situations and God understands situations better than we ever will.  So, I mean, that's just part of what it is.  So Foreman, he's a guy from Houston and he was on his way.  He was in gangs and he was a tough dude.  There was another fighter that said Foreman used to take his money.  I forget what fighter he was in Houston.  He said Foreman used to beat the shit out of him and it would, like, bully him.  And then he becomes a heavyweight champion.  And, you know, Bernard Hopkins did time in jail. 
[02:34:30]  And Tyson, a lot of fighters, because it's a brutal sport, start off and it could go either way.  And Sonny Liston, were you ever in a position where, were you at a crossroads or did you always kind of live a straight and narrow life?  Or was there a time when you were very young where it could have went either way?  No, I always was on the straight and narrow.  I never, I had a type of family that wasn't going to allow me to be on that borderline.  So, like I said, I started because I just loved aggravating people.  That was my goal.  My goal in life was to wake up and see how many people I could aggravate the day before I go back to sleep. 
[02:35:00]  So, if you're not hitting somebody, you enjoy just shit-talking your friends?  All day long.  That's all I do, all day long.  I love it.  It's a constant joker.  That's all I do.  Is that one of your favorite parts of fighting?  Is that actually the whole lead up to it?  That too.  Just like right now, I'm so happy because I know Bernard mad and he want to get this win back.  But like I told him, it's like taking the ASCAP test to graduate from high school.  You failed it back then, you're going to fail it again now.  So, you think he still holds a resentment from 93?  I know he does and I love it.  Why has it been 17, it's been 17 years.  These guys fought Roy, won a 12-round decision in 93. 
[02:35:30]  Why has it been 17 years for the rematch?  It's just situational.  I mean, you know, he had to come to be somebody of power and the way he did that was what I told him.  And he won't ever give me credit for that.  This is what else he's mad about.  I told him back in about 98, he kept talking to me about a fight.  I said, look, man, it doesn't make sense for us to fight right now.  It's not big enough.  I said, go down and beat up on some of the smaller guys.  You can make the weight to beat them.  Then come back and it's a big fight.  So, he goes and beats Tito.  Then he goes and beat Oscar.  He said, now it's time for if we can make it a good fight.  But then he won't fight me then. 
[02:36:00]  Now he says, nah, you wouldn't fight me when I was down.  So, wait a minute.  I was the one who told you how to go get up to make the fight bigger.  Now the fight's bigger.  Nah, nah, I'm not going to fight you now.  You don't want to give me a chance when I was down.  No, I told you what to do to get up so that we can make the fight bigger.  So, he got mad at me about that.  And that's why he wouldn't take the fight.  He can say what he wants to say, but that's why he wouldn't take the fight up until now.  You think it was a pride thing?  He didn't like it?  It was.  It was.  It was definitely a pride thing.  Plus, he don't want to take a chance of losing.  He know ain't nobody out there that got a sense of beating but me.  No.  I mean, he didn't want to take that chance.  Well, Jermaine Taylor did too, but not like I'm going to beat him. 
[02:36:30]  He beat, I mean, he beat Delahoya.  He put him down with a body shot, which is really not hard.  I mean, not easy to do, to put a guy like Delahoya down with a body shot.  All depends on that.  I don't know.  You can't really say it's not easy to do.  Show Jimmy with a body shot that knocks somebody out.  You just made a move towards Jimmy.  Me and my girlfriend were talking about Roy last night.  I was showing her clips on it.  I'm like, just look at what, it's really different than watching every other fighter.  And I even said to her, I'm like, I just wish you were a guy right now.  I said that to her a lot. 
[02:37:00]  She's really funny.  She actually said, why?  So you could suck my dick?  I'm like, all right.  You're a funny girl.  But just even she understood how entertaining it was to watch.  You have to watch him fight because it really is a taunting, like you've never seen another fighter taunt his opponent.  I mean, literally, this one, who did you knock out where you took your hand, he put his hands behind his back and put his chin out and then just knocked the fucking guy out.  Glean and kill it from off street. 
[02:37:30]  Humiliating.  Humiliating.  That is humiliating.  I love all that stuff too, man.  I love that showboating.  I do too.  Well, you've got plenty of coming April 3rd.  Yeah, no kidding.  That's going to be a huge fight with Bernard Hopkins.  Bernard Hopkins in Vegas.  It really is a grudge match, but it's been a long time in coming.  And Bernard is, well, you're 41 or 42 and he's 45.  He's about 47 or 48.  No, he's 45.  So you think he's lying about his age?  He white out on the breast team.  The breast team say 45, he's about 40 and a half.  I don't know.  He's an old guy, though.  Do you catch any shit for showboating? 
[02:38:00]  Do some traditionalists go like, I don't like that.  Always.  Always.  That's why they try to hurry up and get me humiliated, try to get me thrown off the scene  because they hate that I showboat and I play around someone.  They did that to me in the Olympics.  They say, you're going to get robbed.  I said, well, too bad I had to get robbed.  And that's what happened, but it was the best thing that ever happened to me.  Because people remember me more than they remember the guys who won a gold medal that year  because I got robbed.  You were undefeated.  You were 34-0, I think.  And then you had the fight with Griffin.  It was 97.  And he was down. 
[02:38:30]  And you hit him twice when he was down.  Even though it's an older story, what motivated you in that moment?  Were you just in the heat of the moment?  I'll tell you exactly what happened.  To save you some of the problems, the referee said, no standing eight count.  Obey my command.  So if the man goes down, he has to say stop.  Now, if the man went down on his back, I'd have accepted that and left.  Because now on his back, he can't hit me.  But the man dropped to one knee.  If I turn to walk away and the referee didn't say nothing, and he come and hit me and knock me out,  they're going to count me out.  So I can't leave until the referee either say stop or he go down to his back. 
[02:39:00]  I'm not turning my back on a guy that's in a position to take advantage of me.  No.  You understand me?  So if I had to do it all over again, unless that referee said stop, which he did not say that time,  I'd do the same thing.  And I didn't hit the dude hard on either shot.  The second fight, I said, I'm going to show you all what happens when I hit him hard.  And you saw what happened.  It wasn't funny.  That's right.  You saw what happened when I hit him hard.  You saw him running all across the range, taking face dives, get up, take another face dive.  You didn't see him look around, look up, and he had laid out on his face.  That's not what happens when you get knocked out. 
[02:39:30]  You don't have a chance to look at the corner, look up at the referee, didn't fall out.  Yeah.  Now I got no chance to do that.  You go out.  Roy was a champion, and it was, I think, the ninth round.  And the guy went down, and he was disqualified because they said the guy was down and Roy hit him twice.  So it was his first professional loss, and you lost the title.  And then they fought again.  And that first round, it was ugly.  You got it back in one round.  You got it back in one round.  I told him, I'm going to show you what will happen if I hit him for real.  Because when he failed on the first time, I didn't hit him hard. 
[02:40:00]  Sure.  He just took advantage of a situation where when you had guys like Vinny Parzenza, who hit Dana Rosenblatt while he was down, not only did he hit Dana Rosenblatt, he hit the referee.  They didn't disqualify him.  Riddick Bowe hit a guy, I think, Jesse Ferguson, the one when he was down.  They didn't disqualify Riddick Bowe, but they disqualify me.  Why?  Well, what makes me such a bad guy?  Because I should vote?  Probably.  You think that might have hurt you like the referee might have just?  It don't hurt me.  It just makes me a better person.  Nothing they do can hurt me.  I take the George Foreman, Don King approach.  And nothing they can do can hurt me.  When you got God for you, all the rest of it don't matter. 
[02:40:30]  Do you like Don King?  I love Don King.  Oh, you do?  We've had him on the show.  I love Don King.  He's one of my favorite people in the world.  I ain't going to lie to you.  He's tough to keep up with, though.  He's become one of my favorite people in the world because once you understand him,  then you understand a lot more about his whole situation.  Well, a lot of fighters have a problem with him, though, right?  They have a problem, but there's a problem they bring upon themselves.  You know, you got to know what you're signing when you're signing.  And, I mean, if you catch a person, like they said, a rich man, a poor man would always  have to work for a rich man.  If he catches you in a bad situation, then that's what you're in. 
[02:41:00]  And if you sign a paperwork when you're in a bad situation, that's what you're in.  Don't get mad at him about it.  Doesn't he get sued a lot and always win?  He seems to win.  That's why he wins because he ain't really doing as much to him as they say.  Now, he's not the best, but, I mean, I wouldn't say he's not the best.  He is the best, but he's the best at understanding the situation.  Other people don't look at the whole situation first.  He does.  So, they may be signing contracts that aren't really great for them.  That's what's happening.  But they should have a manager look at that.  And when they look at it, then they want to change it.  And it's like, wait a minute.  When you were down, you weren't talking like this. 
[02:41:30]  So, why are you talking like this now?  And that's kind of what happens to most of them.  Well, he said that.  We asked him about that, about stealing from fighters.  And he goes, I'm the one that made him rich.  How can I say that?  I would hate to argue with him.  He really has a way out of everything.  Let me tell you something now.  And to his defense, like I said, he does something wrong to some guys, I think, at times, in my eyes.  I've seen a couple guys that got a raw deal, but for the most part, he's right.  He does make them rich because he got Tyson $100 million before Tyson ever touched a boxing ring when he got out of prison.  Wow.  How many people can say they did that? 
[02:42:00]  Before you ever put a foot in a boxing ring, he got you $100 million weight.  Wow.  And you think some of Mike's trouble was probably Mike, you know, again, he's kind of a reckless guy at times.  Mike's a great guy, but I think the people he had around him kind of hurt him.  Yeah, it seemed like after when Cust Amato died and then Kevin Rudy had a fallout, it seems like then he kind of lost his way.  Some people probably took advantage of him.  Well, you got to look at this like this.  It's like a bulldog.  A bulldog is a law dog.  Whoever raised him, it's been told that's who he knows. 
[02:42:30]  When you put him in other people, he started acting strange because he don't feel the same.  Same with Mike.  Mike knew Cust Amato.  When Cust died, there was nobody else that he trusted like that.  Did you see the documentary?  I'm sure you saw the documentary.  It was great, right?  It was very great.  I loved it.  I had no idea Tyson was so intelligent.  Tyson was very smart.  Yeah, but we didn't know that.  I mean, you got to know that because you're in there.  They don't take a chance to get to know him.  Right, of course.  You got to get to know him.  If you ever talk to him, you'd be surprised.  Yeah, we just saw him, you know, he was an animal to us.  If you had to talk to him, you'd be totally amazed.  Yeah.  But what happens is the animal part of it is what the media took to bring out. 
[02:43:00]  Of course.  That's what looks best for sales.  Yeah, of course.  We yell and scream about the media all the time and how they fucking skew things.  You know, but that was a great film because you did get to see the real Tyson.  Yeah, and Tyson's a very intelligent person.  Very vulnerable, too.  Yeah.  He had no idea.  That's how he took advantage of it.  He was pretty much crying in that movie.  Exactly.  Or on the verge of tears the entire movie.  Yeah, he did cry when he talked about cuss.  He got really choked up.  Yeah, yeah.  That's like a big thing.  And he convinced me of his innocence.  Because, you know, look, I always think, look, I know guys do things with women.  He convinced me of his innocence with Desiree Washington when he's like that wretched bitch. 
[02:43:30]  I'm like, that's how a guy talks when he's innocent.  And that's what an innocent man says.  And you got to do time for it, too.  Of course, you know what I'm saying?  You'd be a bit better, right?  My thing off top was, though, and I got to say this as a grown man, when you look at Mike Tyson and look at Mike Tyson's size,  what young lady is going to go to a room with Mike Tyson by herself with the intentions of not doing what he's saying at 12 o'clock in the morning?  We've always thought that, yeah.  That was always my defense. 
[02:44:00]  My defense was, y'all taking advantage of him because of his situation.  Right.  But who goes to his room at that time of night and not looking for trouble?  Sure.  I personally think, now that I'm, after hearing him talk more about it, I personally think that he went up with her, fooled around with her,  and she was probably, he was probably mean to her after and said, beat it.  And she was mean and vindictive.  And that's my take on it.  Yeah, but see, that don't save him from doing it.  Right.  Absolutely.  A lot of people enjoying the interview.  We're talking to Roy Jones Jr., and someone just wrote, I think the scariest thing about this guy is his soft voice. 
[02:44:30]  It really is because Roy is a soft-spoken guy and a nice guy.  Yes, but you just know.  That's not the guy.  That's never good, right?  That Hopkins is facing.  Yeah, you're not in the ring talking all soft to him.  Your left hook is your bread and butter, I guess.  I don't know.  It's usually my bread and butter because my right hand is hurt, but once my right hand is okay,  I can't tell you that's my bread and butter because I don't know.  They both seem to be kind of the steak.  I mean, I don't know. 
[02:45:00]  Your speed, though, you punch like a much smaller guy.  Yeah.  Like, you really do have a phenomenal speed.  Yeah, it's very different.  Very unorthodox at that.  But that's why I told Benoit Hopkins in the first fight.  You know, I went to the face.  I said, hey, if you can deal with my speed, maybe you can beat me.  But if you can't deal with the speed, you've got a problem in your hand.  Hey, being an older boxer, is it tougher to get ready for these fights?  Well, it's tougher to make yourself go get ready.  Once I get started, it's easier for me then because I'm used to it.  I love preparation.  But the age hasn't really affected you that much? 
[02:45:30]  No, it hasn't affected me that much.  Not at all.  Do you, have you, like, the last fight you fought was a loss to Australia, Danny Green, in Australia.  And it was a first-round knockout.  And you have taken up issue with that.  What happened in that fight and what's the issue with that?  First thing is they let him wrap his hands illegally, which I wasn't totally aware of.  I knew something was wrong and I knew it had to do with the wraps, but they didn't tell me exactly what was wrong  because I guess they didn't want to know.  It made me upset, too.  But we had 18,000 fans out there waiting. 
[02:46:00]  And my side, the guy who we sent to watch him wrap, said that clearly that he had his hands totally wrapped illegal.  He needs to unwrap them.  So when I send my lawyer and my manager over there to make him unwrap and re-wrap them,  they tell him, no, y'all can't get in.  Luckily, the guy saved the box that had there, that adhesive on the gauze that he wrapped with,  which is one of the things he used that was illegal.  You are not allowed to wrap with no gauze out of a box in a boxing match,  especially with an adhesive substance on it because it stretches, it hardens like a cast. 
[02:46:30]  They let him do all this.  He wrapped two hours early.  Why would you wrap your hands two hours early unless you're building a cast?  So after all this, my people go over to do something about it.  They say, no, and if Roy don't come out, we're going to disqualify him.  How are you going to knock out?  How would I have gotten out of Australia if I don't come out of the locker room?  So you wrap your hands in a traditional...  A traditional gauze and use two-and-a-half-inch tape, and you're not allowed to tape the knuckles.  Oh, you're not?  No, you can go between the fingers.  He had both sides of the knuckles tape on all both of them. 
[02:47:00]  I mean, if you go on the Internet, it's a little thing now to show you he had way much more gauze than you're supposed to have on it.  He basically had a cast.  Although he hit me behind the head with a cast, and it did knock me down, but I wasn't out.  I got up.  I got my bearings back, and he was basically worn out from trying to knock me out.  I couldn't.  With a cast on, he couldn't knock me out.  He's toting around that cast on his hand.  But he was trying his best.  He was holding my head, hitting me with everything, and he couldn't knock me out.  So he's dead tired.  And now I know he's tired.  Then the referee stopped the fight.  I said, what you stopping the fight for now? 
[02:47:30]  I'm okay now if you're going to stop.  You should have stopped when I first went down.  I'm fine now.  I don't need you to stop it now.  I'm good.  And I was like, you know, you're in Australia.  They already told me if I didn't come out, they were going to disqualify me.  So I was already fighting a losing battle.  Lucky for me, though, I did get a rematch clause because I was smart, and I knew something like this may happen.  So I made him sign a rematch clause anyway.  Now, next time he had to come to the United States and fight me, or I wrapped my hand with the same cast, and I don't mind.  So you haven't fought him yet?  No, I fought him at once. 
[02:48:00]  We're going to fight again.  No, I know.  The rematch hasn't happened yet.  No, no, no.  Okay.  That was Roy's last fight.  Oh, you said that.  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  It was because Roy goes down, but when he gets back up, the guy is still pounding him, but you were protecting yourself.  Your hands were up.  Perfectly fine.  I don't know what the referee stopped the fight for.  Yeah, he seemed to be just hitting arms and gloves.  He was so frustrated.  He grabbed me behind my head and tried to hit me.  And it's that obvious that you're being hit by a cast situation?  Most definitely.  Most definitely.  Once it happens, I'm like, how the hell a punch like that going to knock me down?  Wow.  I take a much better punch than that.  Then I realize something had to be going on. 
[02:48:30]  Wow.  Well, after the fact, in the ring the whole time, he never would take his gloves off.  Huh.  That also prompted me to figure something was wrong.  Then the next thing when I got in the back, my sparring partner who went over to watch him rap told me all the things that he had.  As a matter of fact, he had it wrote down.  Everything.  It was five illegal things he had used with his rapping.  I don't get that.  Why isn't there like a ref in there as they're rapping?  It is.  And this is what happened.  This is what happened when you go to different places.  Down there, they told me, we don't care what y'all say. 
[02:49:00]  He's not re-wrapping his hands.  What you going to do in Australia?  Amazing.  They know if I don't come out and fight, and these people don't pay to see me fight, they know what's going to happen.  Yeah, of course.  You're in a no-win situation.  Exactly.  They know this.  You have to get out there.  They know this.  So they put me in a bad situation, but that's why I had a remit call.  And that shit still happens.  Yes, it still happens.  Sounds like old school crap.  It just happened.  Matter of fact, like I said, you can go on the internet and check it out yourself.  You'll see it.  What is the, what was the, there's a documentary about a fighter.  There was a big story about it years ago where.  Took the patent out of the club.  They said Panama Lewis did. 
[02:49:30]  He said he didn't do it.  Panama Lewis, right.  But the guy got killed, and the guy that killed him had to end up serving time.  And here's me.  Antonio Margarita did the same thing with the raps to Miguel Cotto.  Well, Miguel Cotto, I thought, would have had a good chance of beating Manny Pacquiao had he not took that beating with that cast from Margarita.  Now, after Margarita couldn't wrap his hand like that against Shane Moseley, Shane Moseley beat him easy.  But Cotto beat Shane Moseley easily.  So that tells you that the cast does have an effect on the way things, the outcome of things. 
[02:50:00]  You know what I mean?  Why don't they have one guy that wraps both of you guys' hands?  Well, because everybody had their own ways of liking to get them wrapped, as long as it's the legal way.  But they're supposed to have a sanctioned body.  People are supposed to be there.  They have a sanctioned body in every state that's supposed to be able to watch that and make sure they wrap them legally.  So who was the fighter that it happened to?  I forgot his name.  I'm not good on names.  But I remember.  But I forgot his name.  I saw it, as a matter of fact.  I watched the documentary several times.  Yeah, the documentary.  He fights this fighter.  And he damages his eye very badly, I think.  And the guy can never fight again. 
[02:50:30]  He got that.  Yeah, he killed in a drunk driving accident, actually.  He was drunk driving into a ditch.  And the guy's father, I think, wanted to sue.  And maybe he didn't want him fighting again.  I think Chris Webber's a fan of yours, Roy.  Oh, is that Chris Webber?  Yeah, Chris Webber just walked by the studio.  Yeah, tell C-Webb, I said, what's up?  You know him?  Yeah, I know C-Webb.  You try to get him on the show to say hi.  It looks like you wanted to come in and just say hi to you real fast.  You should have came in.  That's, uh, wow.  Chris Webber is a rock star, man.  Yeah, I did.  So he was looking in.  I knew he didn't recognize me.  Tall gentleman. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  It really does take your ego away when you're sitting next to Roy and somebody looks in.  C-Webb.  What's up, big homie?  What's up, baby?  How you doing?  Chris Webber.  Good respect, man.  Good to see you, man.  What's up, Chris?  How you doing?  Huge fan, by the way.  I saw you walk by and I'm like, I think he's a fan of Roy Jones Jr. because you were looking  in here.  I'm a fan of you.  Of course I'm a fan of Roy Jones.  How could you not be?  Yeah, right on.  I'm a fan of you.  Hell yeah.  I love watching C-Webb. 
[02:51:30]  Absolutely.  Still check him out on TNT now.  That's what's up, man.  Have you ever made the mistake of tangling with a guy Roy's size, thinking that it'd be  an easy mark and not realizing it was a guy like Roy?  No, I'm from Detroit, and so in Detroit, you got to watch out for guys, whoever they are.  Short, tall.  You know, I respect men, so when they put their hands up, you never know.  The bigger you are, the harder you fall.  So it'll be funny.  I'm somewhere and want to fight Roy.  Don't know when you're a boxer, and he just hit you with a real quick.  Yeah.  That's it, right? 
[02:52:00]  I try to grab him and wrestle him or something like that.  No, I'm not a fool.  He's got a big fight with Bernard Hopkins coming up in April, so you're really talking  about it.  Yeah, I'm really excited about that.  Talking about the boxing game, it's such a, wow, such an interesting sport.  Yeah, have you ever fought, or have you always just played ball?  Well, you know what?  I actually got a chance to train with Mayweather's uncle.  Oh, really?  Yeah, for maybe 10 rounds, and I respect what y'all do.  Right, man.  It's something else.  Oh, man.  I mean, I never knew that three minutes could be that long. 
[02:52:30]  I thought it was going to be a six-month thing.  He's like, for 10 rounds, one afternoon.  Oh, yeah.  And I was like, cool, it's time to get abs on.  I see you, man.  I can do this on my own, because it was just, no, it was tough.  It ain't happening.  It ain't happening.  Yeah.  What round you going to knock him out in, man?  Probably about the eighth.  Eighth?  Yeah, I don't see him going past eight.  How are you going to do it?  Combo or just?  No, I'm a one puncher.  I got a combination for him already.  I used it last fight on him, but my hands hurt, so I couldn't get him all the way,  but I knew it would get him this time.  Okay, what color, what color drawings you rocking in?  Probably going to be black again.  Black again?  Yeah, probably going to go black on black. 
[02:53:00]  I'm going to be the Terminator.  I'm going to terminate his career.  What music are you coming in, too?  I think me and Snoop going to hell on that, baby.  Woo!  I came up for the fight, baby!  Yeah, I think me and Snoop going to hell on that, you know?  Steve's pointing that he's got to go.  Yeah, I know.  I just wanted to come and say I'm a big fan, and I saw that you were looking at Roy.  Roy Jones, baby.  Appreciate you stopping by, baby.  Look at that.  Chris Weaver and Steve.  Keep doing that.  Thank you, Chris.  Thank you, man.  Thank you, man.  I will.  Sorry to drag you away from what you were doing.  There goes Jimmy.  You get the photo.  Jimmy loves the photo.  Of course. 
[02:53:30]  So you work on...  Oh, Roy Jones.  Yeah.  And can I point out what weasels we are?  If Bernard Hopkins was here, would we go, oh, you got a great shot.  Roy has no chance against you.  Hell no.  Not me, Roy.  Not me.  That's Jimmy, man.  Screw Bernard.  I'm all about Roy Jones Jr. now.  I'll say right to his face for you.  But it is right, though.  He's out of the room.  That's the amazing thing to me about a guy of that size, a guy like your size, is much  more dangerous.  And a lot of guys probably underestimate a smaller guy.  They do.  They do.  They totally underestimate a smaller guy. 
[02:54:00]  And you work on a certain combination for each fighter?  No, no, no.  It just all depends on what works.  You know what I mean?  You try to see what works, what happens.  Yeah.  If it works, it works.  But I knew when it worked on him before, and I would have worked again.  So, you know, I'm just looking forward to it.  Why are we showing this fight?  He doesn't want to see this.  Can you show...  Exactly.  We're on Utah.  Can you...  That's Mars, by the way.  If you want to hit him, you can.  I don't mind.  Any mechanical problems, he's responsible for.  Can you find the fight, the second fight, what...  The guy's name is...  Montel Griffin.  Montel Griffin.  Yeah.  Fight two.  He hits him so fucking hard that he... 
[02:54:30]  That's where the ropes held him up.  Yeah, they held him up.  They didn't hold him up.  No, he went straight down.  Well, the ref called it a knockdown because the only thing that didn't keep his ass from  hitting the canvas was when he bounced off the...  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The first time, yeah.  Yeah.  He called it a knockdown.  You're right.  That's this one when I first came out, me looking for trouble.  Yeah, this is the guy who had had him disqualified the first one.  It's just an ugly fight.  Right.  And I told you he was going to refight that last round.  So that was a good shot.  Now, hurt him.  The very first punch hurt him.  Yeah, he's hurt already.  He's hurt already.  And I knew it because he can't take a punch to me with my punch. 
[02:55:00]  Boom.  There's one of the things.  Yeah.  Right into...  Already.  Yeah.  That was a nice left.  Sent him right into the lower.  Already separating you guys.  We call it a knockdown.  If there was no ring, he'd have gone back right at the door.  Yeah, exactly.  He would have fallen back into his car and just headed home.  20 seconds of the fight, you knocked him down.  Mm-hmm.  It's very apparent that...  Oh, my God.  You're destroying him.  Yeah, this is a very humiliating knockout.  Yeah, I didn't have time to play with him.  I had messed with him the first time.  I wasn't giving him a chance this time.  The mini-rounds of the first...  Yeah, you know you got to dispense with this guy pretty quickly. 
[02:55:30]  Exactly.  It's going to get this over with.  I said, I know you can't take my punch.  All the talking you did.  I know you can't pop and take my punch.  I'm going to get this over with right now.  But did he really talk after the fight?  Yes, he did.  Big time.  Big time.  Big time.  Which basically just motivated you to come in.  That's all.  That's all.  That's all.  Maybe he's coming in and showing him right now who he's in charge.  I know he quit the first time.  You can't quit on me and talk noise like you can beat me.  You quit the first fight.  You got a decent punch in without counter-mouth.  His arm right in the face. 
[02:56:00]  That left is just hanging down and waiting for his face.  I got him thinking I'm trying to kill him, which I was.  But you seem to be comfortable letting your guard down, which really is a lack of respect  for the other fighter, which has got to drive them nuts.  Which I really don't need to care about a punch.  Unless I know you got a cast on.  I've learned that.  But if you ain't got no cast, I don't care about no punch.  This knockout is coming in.  Yeah, it's very close right here.  As a matter of fact, I gave him a feint.  I gave him a feint. 
[02:56:30]  Watch him throw a hook at him.  Throw a hook at him right there.  I feinted him.  Throw another one at him.  Setting him up for it.  Watch this do it now.  There was another hook at him.  The turn back in the left hook.  Yeah, the hook got him scared.  Extremely cautious now.  Hook at him.  Hook right here.  Another hook at him.  That hook hurt him a little bit.  I said, yeah, I'm liking this.  So I said, I got him now.  So I feint him for a hook there.  Feint him for a hook again.  He's protecting him against the hook. 
[02:57:00]  Now I got what I want.  I saw that one.  He just tried to duck him.  I said, okay, now I got him.  Now I got him.  He tried to duck him.  Ah, come here.  Duck that.  Good night.  That's what happens when you get knocked out.  Look at his face.  You got a chance to get up and look at people and fall down.  That's what happens when you get knocked out.  I can try to get up.  Oh, he can't get up.  This is what happens.  This is what happens.  He's falling across the ring.  He just tried to get up like four times and fell on his face.  Yeah, that's what happens when you get hit with a punch for real.  So they said the first time, and I tried to explain to him, the first time I didn't really hit him hard. 
[02:57:30]  He wouldn't have had a chance to look at the referee, look at his corner, then go down.  That's what would have happened right there.  That's a knockout.  It's hard to marry the image of this nice man with that guy.  I mean, it really is deceptive.  That's the guy that you're dealing with in the ring.  Right before a fight, what is going through your head before you walk in the ring, and what are you doing to focus yourself?  You got to remember, what's going through my head is, okay, let's go out here and have a great time while this guy's trying to kill you.  Let's try to convince him that he really needs to kill you, and let's just take advantage of that. 
[02:58:00]  So you like to get him upset.  And the angrier they are, the more likely they are to make a mistake.  You're exactly right.  Who would you say has hit you the hardest in your career?  A guy named Eddie Evans from Atlanta, Georgia actually hit me harder than anybody ever has.  Can he knock you down?  No, he just hit me with a real hard punch.  And after that punch, I stopped him in the next round, but I was still mad because I don't feel like I hit him enough to make up for that one punch he hit me with.  Did he know he hurt you as badly as he did?  He didn't hurt.  He just hurt.  He hurt painfully.  Not a hurt like buckle knee.  It was a painful punch. 
[02:58:30]  When he hit me, I was like, wow.  That hurt.  This dude can punch.  So now I'm finna kill him.  And then he quit on me too quick.  I was like, no, you can't quit yet.  Don't you all let me quit.  I haven't killed you yet.  I ain't got my lick back yet.  Let me know less quick.  I hit him, but that ain't hard enough.  And this is something I would like to know.  What are you thinking when you get knocked out, especially after all those victories?  Like the first time you actually get knocked out, do you know it's happening as it's happening?  Or like when you wake up, are you like, what happened?  You know it.  Like the first time I knew it, I was like, wow. 
[02:59:00]  I guess my body couldn't take it no more.  Because I went down to, I went to heavyweight, then I lost 25 pounds and came back down to light heavyweight.  I won one on the skin of my breath because I was just all game, all heart, didn't have no energy.  I came back, I re-fought it up, and that's when I got knocked out the first time.  Was that Tarver?  Yeah, I got knocked down.  I got up, but I was pretty much done.  I couldn't recover.  I felt my body.  I couldn't come back from it.  Then the second fight when I fought Johnson, he knocked me out completely.  But I was dehydrated, but that was a complete knockout.  And I was like, wow, how do I keep getting knocked out like this?  And that was really the only time I got knocked out. 
[02:59:30]  Then, like I said, with the green shot, it was a shot behind the head, which I expected.  You got to expect that if it got hit you behind the head with a bat or a cast, that's what happened.  But I got up from that, too, and I recovered.  I was like, okay, as long as I get up, I'm good.  So I don't mind getting knocked down and getting up.  A lot of fights go through that.  But the knockout one, I think that was highly because I was dehydrated, but that was the one that bothered me the most.  Is it embarrassing?  I know it's something an odd question, but is it an embarrassing feeling?  It's like slipping in front of people, or do you wake up and just realize all these people have just seen me really be defeated? 
[03:00:00]  They just saw you get knocked out.  You just got caught hit with a hell of a punch.  I mean, as minimum as you done knocked out, now your turn came.  It sucks, right?  Yeah, it's not good, but hey, that's a possibility when you walk out there.  Hey, we only have a few more minutes left, and everyone wants to say hi to Roy.  Oh, okay.  Let's not forget the big fight, Roy Jones Jr. and Bernard Hopkins.  The rematch, April 3rd at the Mandalay Bay Center in Las Vegas.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Rochester.  Jeff, say hi to Roy Jones Jr.  What's up, Jeff?  How you doing, Roy?  I just want to know, how many of those chicken names can you come up with off the top of your head right now? 
[03:00:30]  What do you mean chicken names?  I used to ref your basketball league down in Pensacola.  Right.  You had those chickens, and you had names for them.  Oh, yeah, I got a lot of them.  I forgot most of them because I got rid of most of them, but you're right, I had a lot of names for them.  You had a chicken farm or something, right?  Yeah, yeah.  And you were named the chickens?  I don't kick your ass, Roy.  Yeah, my favorite one's name was Dog, though.  He acted like a dog, and he was a rooster, and he used to follow me around and just jump up on my arm.  He was the coolest one I ever had.  I thought roosters were awful, and you couldn't go near them. 
[03:01:00]  I thought they were very, very violent.  That's not true.  They say they paint a bad picture of them just because of the fighting situation.  They paint a really bad picture, but they're not that bad.  They're very nice and intelligent animals.  Oh, kind of like pit bulls.  If you raise them a certain way, they're not good.  I don't know how you raise them.  Okay.  Yeah, let's say hi to Jerry in Indiana.  Jerry.  Hey, good afternoon.  Good morning, guys.  Hi.  Hey, Roy, I just wanted to say thank you.  You got me laid one night.  What happened?  You took the money you wanted from the fight and got a hooker?  Yeah, he's like, exactly. 
[03:01:30]  Well, tell the story.  How did he get laid?  I was sitting in a bar, and I was watching Roy fight, and I'm a big fan.  And this gal was sitting next to me, and she asked me if I was a fan.  And I said, yeah.  She goes, well, you and I are the only fans in here that like Roy.  And I said, well, he's going to kick that guy's ass.  And she said, that's right.  And then next thing you know, we're in her hotel room, and I'm getting laid,  and I just wanted to say thanks.  Hey, no problem.  I'm glad you enjoyed it.  Yeah, you get the chance.  And one more, because we've got to get Roy out of here.  Rod in Kansas.  What's up, Rod?  Hey, morning, guys.  Hey, Roy, big fan. 
[03:02:00]  Just real quick, I was going to see if you could talk about that.  About the one fight where you actually take your, I believe it's your left hand,  cock your right forearm like a shotgun, and knock this dude smoother than the next Sunday.  Yeah, man, I do all those type things.  That probably was Richard Hall.  I really enjoy entertaining my fans.  You know, I'm a hunter.  I do it all.  I do a lot of things.  And it's like all the things I do in life, I try to take them, bring them to the boxing ring,  and use them to entertain my people.  And that's why I was so much different in my career and a lot of other fighters, including  Bernard Hopkins, because nothing against tennis, but watching Bernard Hopkins fight is like 
[03:02:30]  watching a tennis match, a normal tennis match, and watching me fight is like a rodeo.  You know what I mean?  Anything in life will happen when I fight.  But when he fights, the ball is just going to go back and forth, because there ain't going  to be nothing exciting.  I mean, so he hates me for that, but that's not my fault.  So I'm sorry.  It's got to be awful to get taunted and then get knocked out.  Like, if a guy taunts you and then you knock him out.  And then you're just like, yeah, yeah, you talk, but you couldn't fucking deliver.  There's one fight you have where the guy is trying to do what Roy does. 
[03:03:00]  James Toney?  And he puts his arms out like that.  James Toney?  Oh, Benny Pazianza.  Oh, was that Benny Pazianza?  Yeah, Pazianza.  He puts his arms out almost like a crucifix, and then Roy puts his arms out.  And they're just kind of posturing, and you kind of dance into him and knock him out.  Yeah, those Pazianza.  Your highlight reel is as good as anybody on YouTube.  These punches are devastating.  Oh, yeah, that guy just swung at air.  Made him swing at air there.  I want to see the one that they show.  We're just watching boxing.  That's him right there.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was the guy right there.  It's a highlight reel.  Roy Jones Jr. 
[03:03:30]  It's just Roy Jones Jr.  Punches that are devastating.  You've got to see them with the hands behind the back.  That is the most humiliating thing.  Yeah.  Fast hands.  Like I said, my thing was I thank God for blessing me with the opportunity and with the ability  to be able to deliver these type of highlights to people because no other boxer has as good  of highlights as these are on YouTube or nowhere else.  I got the best highlight reel of all time, I guarantee you.  It really is amazing.  It's only by the grace of God that I was able to do it.  And I don't even understand how I did a lot of it or why I did a lot of it.  But I know I was just a crazy guy that loved entertaining people. 
[03:04:00]  And come April 3rd, my job is to go out there and give you the same entertainment against  a guy who's probably top notch.  As a matter of fact, the best life he's with out there right now, I'm going to give you  the same show against him.  You have kids.  Would you recommend your kids get into boxing or try to see them in the other direction?  No, they've got too big of a pair of shoes to feel if they go into boxing.  I'd rather them go somewhere else.  Let's show some versatility here.  Let's use the DNA to go show some other aspects in life.  Let's show them that the DNA ain't just in one place.  There's great DNA all over.  Well, you acted in Devil's Advocate.  Yep, and in The Matrix 2. 
[03:04:30]  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Three rap albums.  Captain Ballot.  Damn.  Yeah.  He's got to go.  They're trying to drag him out of here.  I'm sorry.  We could talk to you all day, Roy.  Obviously, Roy Jones Jr.  The great Roy Jones Jr.  Of course.  Thank you all so much.  The fight April 3rd, Mandalay Bay, Bernard Hopkins.  Finally a rematch after 17 years.  And thanks so much, Roy.  We've been happy to have you.  Thank you guys for having me.  All right, cool.  Quick break.  When are we going to get him back on?  Oh, my God, Madsen.  It's been way too fucking long. 
[03:05:00]  Get Madsen.  I was listening to one of the replays about a week ago or something.  It was Dice doing his Michael Madsen impression.  Yeah.  When, who the hell was here?  What's her name from?  Yeah, Mila Jovovich was here.  And he called me.  He was calling us Slim.  Hey, Slim.  She's like this big Hollywood star.  Hey, Slim.  But when he fucking did the Madsen impression, it's like, you know, just say, just ask me,  like, hey, Mike, what's up? 
[03:05:30]  Well, how you doing?  And he just goes, good.  Good.  And that was it.  See, it's spot on.  That was it.  Fucking Dice.  That was great.  Right on.  Uh, wrapping up, I guess, we, uh, what, Super Bowl is most watched TV show ever?  I don't know if I buy it.  Yeah, I don't know if I buy it.  Right over MASH.  Beating out the MASH finale from 1983, but back then, I mean.  Back then it was, I forget the percentage of.  Less people.  Also, the, uh.  Less things to watch. 
[03:06:00]  A lot less television shows.  So I think, I think the Super Bowl thing is more impressive is what I'm saying.  You gotta weigh it, you know.  No, I would say Super Bowl's more impressive because there are a lot more choices.  And to get, and still to get that many people to watch.  Yeah, but a sporting event is different than a comedy, too.  It's like, this will be on in bars.  That was a two and a half hour, like, sitcom episode.  Hold on, where the fuck is the man?  I can't find it.  All right.  All right, Jimmy, what do you need?  And I can't find anything.  And it was only. 
[03:06:30]  Uh, 106.5 million watched the Super Bowl.  MASH finale, 105.97.  So, wow, real close.  There's just a half million more people watching the Super Bowl over the MASH thing.  More people on 1983.  On Earth.  Earth.  More people on the globe.  That's right.  And there are.  If the MASH audience was eclipsed, it's probably due to a large part that the whole country is ready for New Orleans.  And there's also a lot more television sets.  114.9 million TV sets now.  Whoa.  In 83, there were 83.3 million. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, but.  Come on.  But you go with the percentages.  77% of homes with TVs on were watching MASH in 83, compared with the audience share of 68 for the Super Bowl.  That's a lot of people.  Watching one thing.  Well, this is the question I got.  I mean, a lot of people watched the Super Bowl because of the New Orleans angle.  It's obvious.  Sure.  With the whole Katrina thing, you know, it's sparked an interest in people that probably wouldn't watch the Super Bowl in general.  Do you think?  It has to be because this Super Bowl.  Yes.  Killed.  What was the second most Super Bowl? 
[03:07:30]  I'm trying to think why.  Because, I mean, it's not too huge cities.  And they'd never, people, they'd never been there before.  And they were both really good teams.  It was a good matchup.  Give me the second.  Well, there were that many TVs looted that they could actually watch the games.  Giants Patriots.  Giants Patriots.  How many people watched the Giants Patriots?  97.5 million.  And what year was that?  That was the.  2008.  That was 2008.  It was 97.5 million.  And so you're telling me that, all right, almost 10 million more people watched this Super Bowl. 
[03:08:00]  That's a big freaking difference from the most watched and the second most watched.  Yes.  Has anybody else noticed that there weren't a lot of Katrina jokes flying while there was a certain gentleman sitting here?  Yeah, of course.  That just slipped my mind.  It was very quiet when we had Roy Jones Jr. and the other very large Negro in studio.  What?  You wouldn't say that?  That's not the terminology.  I'm sure that. 
[03:08:30]  Weber seems like a nice guy.  I would love to talk to Chris Weber.  Yeah.  He looks like he'd be a lot of fun.  I wonder who he's promoting.  We should have asked him.  I forgot to ask him.  But he seemed like a nice dude.  He's tall.  What does he play?  Basketball?  You see how fucking tall that guy is?  My guy.  He was almost hitting the tiles.  He had to duck down like I was a child.  You are.  And I was stupid enough to think when I was growing up that I could play fucking in the NBA.  Not acknowledging that I was playing against guys that were already a foot taller than me.  That ain't going to work.  How tall is he?  I would guess six.  I was going to go 6'10".  For real. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah?  Is that what he is?  6'10".  How's your Chris Weber picture?  Good?  I'm looking right now at my Roy Jones Jr. picture.  And I can't use a flash with black guys because the camera doesn't know what to do.  It literally looks.  Wait, what did you just say?  Hold on.  You can't just have a statement like that.  I didn't hear.  I didn't hear.  Not.  Let me hear this.  I said I can't use the flash when I'm with black guys because the camera.  The camera doesn't know what to do.  And you're talking about it.  No, no, no.  But that's not racist.  It happened to me when I.  Does the camera want to run and hide?  No, and I took one with Michael K. Williams too because the contrast.  I'm very, very pale. 
[03:09:30]  And the contrast is it focuses on one.  And it's always like Roy looks perfect.  And in my Michael K. Williams, he looks perfect.  And I am so white.  It looks like Roy Jones Jr. caught a fish.  Can I?  You need the new Kodak Negro cam.  Yes, the Negro cam from Kodak Land Cameras.  I got an explanation for that if you want to hear me.  Yes, I do.  Definitely.  Your camera is too busy screaming in fear.  Oh.  I don't think it's. 
[03:10:00]  That's a screaming in fear thing that the camera does.  Aren't there different levels of flash?  Throwing too much light on.  Dude, look at this.  Look at it.  Okay.  There is a contrast.  You are very, very white in that.  I get very washed out because, again, I think the camera.  I don't know how it focuses, but.  You know what you got to do?  You got to run it in Photoshop and then adjust the levels.  Can that be fixed in Photoshop?  It can absolutely be fixed without making him darker.  You can make your lightness darker and more lifelike for yourself by adjusting levels. 
[03:10:30]  I have this picture of my Michael K. Williams.  It was Omar.  And they both came out like that.  I will pay $5,000.  No, I'm just kidding.  I should ask somebody who's really good at Photoshop.  If somebody, anybody with Photoshop could throw that on there and within a minute.  And worse it up a little bit.  Just slide the levels over a little bit and you'll be fine.  I look like a fucking, I have little, I look like a rat.  Colin's right.  I'm a red-lipped fucking rat.  Look at the freaking extreme close-up. 
[03:11:00]  Hey, did you look down?  Because there's something about the Super Bowl I wasn't thinking and a few people got it.  I did not.  Why?  There's something we're forgetting and why this Super Bowl did so much better than the Giants-Patriots.  Almost 10 million more viewers, right?  About nine and change.  Is it location, do you think?  Now, the New Orleans thing didn't hurt, obviously.  But if you think about it, New York.  There was something that.  And then Boston and that whole New England area is going to have a higher population. 
[03:11:30]  Sure, but there's a reason why this Super Bowl did even better.  An obvious one that we're missing.  Obvious that we're missing?  Oh, the racial angle, white-black?  Nope.  And it's been discussed a lot, I guess, on sports radio.  I did not know this.  I think.  Because...  It's right in front of your face.  Peyton Manning throws very far.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  They were very close in their record for the year.  No.  No.  Although it was the two best teams. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  The worst teams ever.  I know, I'm sorry.  The dumb snowstorm had a lot more people inside stuck.  So they said, you know what, what the fuck?  Oh, what?  They said, you know what, what the fuck?  We're stuck.  We're snowed in.  Holy shit.  Let's see what this Super Bowl thing is about.  I didn't even think about that.  Holy shit.  Holy dog shit.  Yeah, it didn't snow when MASH was on.  Da-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Is it annoying that whenever MASH comes on, I make that noise with the theme song?  Ba-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na. 
[03:12:30]  That volume.  God, I hate you.  I would love to do that.  Chris L. from Jersey and a few others telling me about the snowstorm thing.  Yeah, go ahead, do it, Jimmy.  Ba-na-na-na.  Ba-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  I want to join you.  Ba-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Ba-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  I thought it hurts.  Brings on many changes 
[03:13:00]  Toodly-doo, toodly-doo  Right?  Hey, uh...  You do it all day!  Also, uh, uh, lots of props for, uh, Jimmy.  He did a really good job with the Roy Jones Jr. interview there.  He knows his boxing show.  Yes, he does.  And, uh, finally...  Anthony, what's this Iran thing about? 
[03:13:30]  They're going to surprise the world tomorrow?  I don't know!  It's tomorrow the big day!  Tomorrow is the, uh...  Well, that's weird.  Wouldn't that be the...  Wait, Tim...  They said on the anniversary.  What, um...  I think it's February...  February 11th is the anniversary of that whole I told it thing.  Yeah, yeah.  1979.  And, and...  So that would be 31 years ago.  Well, Iran is saying that they have a big, like, surprise in store. 
[03:14:00]  That the West is going to pretty much shit their pants at what they are pulling.  At some kind of shenanigan that they will, uh, pull.  I don't know what it is.  I have no idea.  Um, they're, they're using radio techniques here with the tease.  They're teasing.  Yeah, a little radio tease.  And we'll tell you about it tomorrow.  Grace.  Yes.  Tune in tomorrow.  After the stoning.  But, yeah.  Uh...  But they were, they're ignoring everybody, right, at this point. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah, now they're, they're, they're ramping up their, um, nuclear program.  They are, uh, starting to produce drone planes for reconnaissance.  Hmm?  Maybe.  Maybe, uh, to strap some missiles, too.  Uh, and they, uh, we'll use them well within range of Israel.  All they have to do is fucking, uh, nuke Israel.  And, uh, we get that apocalypse that we wanted.  That's all it's going to take, though.  We get that world turmoil, that world war, zombies. 
[03:15:00]  We get that world war, zombies.  We get that world war, zombies.  We get that world war, zombies.  We get that world war, zombies.  We get that world war, zombies.  We get that world war, zombies.  We get that world war, zombies.  We get that world war, zombies.  We get that world war, zombies.  We get that world war, zombies.  We get that world war, zombies.  We get that world war, zombies.  We get that world war, zombies.  We get that world war, zombies.  We get that world war, zombies.  We get that world war, zombies.  We get that world war, zombies.  We get that world war, zombies.  We get that world war, zombies.  We get that world war, zombies.  We get that world war, zombies.  We get that world war, zombies. </pre>
