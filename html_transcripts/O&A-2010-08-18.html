<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a discussion about Montana Fishburne's pornographic career and the speculated impact on her relationship with her father, Lawrence Fishburne.  The hosts engaged in graphic descriptions of her films and explicit speculation about Lawrence Fishburne's reaction, using sexually explicit language. This transitioned into a debate surrounding Dr. Laura Schlessinger's use of the n-word, her apology, and the subsequent fallout, including comparisons to the hosts' own past controversies and firings.  They criticized Larry King's handling of the situation in a later interview.  A caller, CJ from Atlanta, briefly interrupted to complain about the iPhone keyboard's difficulty for those with large thumbs.  The show briefly mentioned Bobby Thompson's death and speculated on Lou Gehrig's cause of death, playing a portion of Thompson's famous home run call.  New Apple products and the BlackBerry Torch were also briefly discussed.  A planned phone call with Montana Fishburne did not materialize.

The show continued with further speculation on Dr. Laura Schlessinger's departure from radio, questioning the sincerity of her stated reason for leaving.  The hosts criticized her communication style, using vulgar and misogynistic language, and discussed the influence of media outlets and figures like Reverend Al Sharpton and Media Matters on the careers of radio personalities.  They referenced their own firing from WNEW, the Imus controversy, and Morton Downey Jr.'s confrontational interview style. A caller recounted a confrontation between Reverend Al Sharpton and another guest on the Morton Downey Jr. show.  The segment also briefly touched upon Brett Favre's retirement and the Westboro Baptist Church's legal victory regarding protesting at military funerals.

The next segment focused heavily on the Westboro Baptist Church and their protests at military funerals. The hosts and callers expressed anger and contempt towards the church, particularly Fred Phelps, using highly offensive and homophobic language.  A YouTube video showing an altercation between Westboro Baptist Church protesters and counter-protesters, resulting in a protester being hit with a bowling ball, was discussed.  The conversation then veered into unrelated topics: a caller's story about their child overhearing their parents having sex; a Florida mother arrested for child endangerment after posting a picture of her son with a tobacco pipe (mistaken for a bong); a Toronto police officer's explanation of paraphernalia laws; and a humorous segment on a child playing piano with his feet on *China's Got Talent*.  A call from actor Jay Moore led to a lengthy, vulgar argument with comedian Otto over joke origins. Vince Neil was briefly mentioned as being in the studio.

The show later included announcements for an upcoming Opie and Anthony show at the House of Blues, featuring Otto and George, Nick DiPaolo, and Andy Levy, along with crude jokes about Bill Cosby.  This segued into a phone interview with Montana Fishburne, which included graphic discussions of her film's content, her relationship with her father, and rumors about a prostitution arrest and her boyfriend potentially being a pimp. Fishburne denied the prostitution allegation. The hosts criticized their own poor preparation for the interview, highlighting missed opportunities due to insufficient research and briefing materials.

The final segment began with criticism of the inadequate preparation for the Montana Fishburne interview, blaming staff member Eric and mentioning a prior news item from August 8th concerning her boyfriend being a pimp. This transitioned into a humorous discussion about a slowed-down version of a Justin Bieber song, which the hosts found oddly compelling.  The segment concluded with a commercial break for a website selling wedding bands.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The greatest show on satellite radio today.  It's entertaining as fuck.  How many people are screaming at their radios right now?  It doesn't get better than this. 
[00:00:30]  It's just the stupidest, most fun.  I can't get enough of this.  I would eat your poo.  You know, let's be honest with each other.  No one's doing better radio than this.  We rule Google it.  You're fucking right.  Simple as that.  Fucking believe it.  This is radio.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's do it.  Morning, everybody.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi, everyone.  How's everybody this morning?  Oh, God damn wonderful. 
[00:01:00]  Wonderful it is, then.  Yes.  Wonderful it is.  Yes, it is.  I'm tuckered out.  Tuckered out?  You've got to be plum tuckered out.  I just kept waking up.  Yeah?  I could bed at like 12, which is really familiar.  I kept waking up.  Aw.  Poor Yemi.  We've got Montana Fishburne coming in today.  Not coming in.  Phone call, right?  I was watching some of that movie.  She's a good porn actress.  Yeah?  Yeah, she's sexy.  They like being called actresses.  She's very sexy.  Yes, adult film star.  Yeah, adult film star.  That means you suck the cack on tape. 
[00:01:30]  Well, Lawrence Fishburne is disappointed in his daughter.  We all know that.  But here's the real reason.  I hope so.  We've got to ask her about this, too.  Montana.  Well, Lawrence is mad at Montana for using the family name to kick off her porn career.  And he makes a good point here.  He says, you used your last name.  No one uses their real name in porn.  All right.  Got to get an ass.  That's what he's really pissed off about.  Poor Morpheus.  And basically he's saying that he won't talk to her until she gets her shit back together. 
[00:02:00]  Until you turn your life around, so.  He used to turn her ass around.  That's a good point, though.  All the porn stars, they don't fucking use their real last names.  They come up with wacky porn names.  It's a selling point.  Of course it is.  It's like she's playing the Larry Fishburne card.  You embarrass me.  He continues.  So.  But that's the only reason anyone is talking to Montana Fishburne is it's because she's  she's the daughter of Lawrence Fishburne.  Yeah.  We wouldn't be talking to her, right? 
[00:02:30]  Nope.  If it was just pitched.  Hello.  I have Lawrence Fishburne's daughter.  She's doing an independent film.  I shut it.  Move along.  But since she's, you know, sucking some cack.  Oh, oh, oh.  Yeah.  Maybe she could.  Why are you giving that to Anthony?  He doesn't like that color.  A little chocolate?  He hates that color.  Well, let me take a look at that.  Not a fan of that color.  Her nude on the back there.  You should be a fan of her big and heavies.  She's got some nice bosoms, but she does look like her dad in Apocalypse. 
[00:03:00]  Jimmy was right.  No, come on.  Her face kind of looks like her dad in Apocalypse.  A little bit young.  Yeah.  She should have the broken arrow and put it through her head.  Yeah.  Hey, clean.  You think?  Yeah.  She's brushing her teeth out of a little cup on the Nung River.  A few clicks above the Nung.  Of course.  17.  I'll take a look at that.  He was so good in that.  He really was.  Well, she's her father's daughter, as they say. 
[00:03:30]  You know, she looks like her dad a little bit.  Yeah.  She's sexy, though.  Definitely.  Yeah, she's definitely sexy.  Great body.  It looks like a homemade porn, which is what I like about it.  It's not gritty.  Is it gritty?  Well, the camera work, it's like a one-guy shoot.  It doesn't look like a whole big production.  POV?  Is it POV?  Yes, it is.  Some of it.  Not all of it.  Some of it is.  They've got to start stripping down those porns again, right?  I agree.  Enough with the over-the-top production.  And she's a squirter.  Oh, my God. 
[00:04:00]  Is it urine?  No.  No, no, no.  Sometimes they fake it, and it's actually urine coming out.  No, no, no.  No tinkle.  No tinkle.  Wow.  What a squirter.  All right.  We'll ask her about that.  No holds barred.  Mmm.  That sounds good.  Interview with her later on.  Yeah, I wish she was coming in, but I think she's in L.A.  That would be nice.  Finishing up our discussion, we ended yesterday's show with, um, talking about, you know, the  best covers.  Yeah.  Cover songs of all time.  Never really got an answer to the question, what's the best cover song of all time?  But man, everyone has- 
[00:04:30]  I think it's so subjective.  Everyone has their favorites, that's for sure.  Yeah.  And I was listening to cover songs all fucking day because of the listeners.  I mean, everyone's suggesting a million songs I've never heard before.  But the one, I was telling Ant before the show, the one that just got me was A Perfect  Circle, which is Maynard's little side, you know, project.  He's got a bunch of side projects.  Yeah.  You know, the dude from Tool.  He does a version of Imagine, and I was telling Anthony what's amazing about this cover,  he completely takes the hope out of the song.  So, whether you like or hate John Lennon and his message in Imagine, he kind of gave 
[00:05:00]  the world a little hope that, hey, you know what, we could turn this thing around.  If we all just get together and-  Right.  Don't separate ourselves with these trivial things.  Yes.  No, I mean, it's more of a dream than anything, of course.  Yeah.  But, uh, Maynard, when he sings his version of Imagine, he basically goes, fuck that,  and takes the hope out of the song, which makes it an amazing cover.  And just, uh, in case you're a bit confused, the video makes it perfectly,  perfectly clear, you should not have any hope for this world. 
[00:05:30]  Really?  Oh, my God.  The imagery he uses in the video to get his message across is just ridiculous.  Guys dead on the street with their heads blown out.  I think I like that message.  Yeah, you like it?  Yeah.  You want to hear just a piece of it to start the show today?  Sure.  It's very, it's very dark, but very, very cool.  Yeah, he's playing the low, the low end of the fucking piano, too. 
[00:06:00]  Rap.  Imagine there's no heaven It's easy if you try  No hell below us Above us only sky  Imagine all the people Living for today 
[00:06:30]  Imagine there's no country It isn't hard to do  Nothing to kill or die for 
[00:07:00]  No religion to win No religion to win  Imagine all the people Living a life in peace  You may say I'm a dreamer  But I'm not the only one 
[00:07:30]  I hope someday you will join us  In the world of this one  That little taste  We don't have to play the whole fucking song  That's some brutal pictures in it  Yeah, I think that's a different video than what I was watching yesterday  That's a fan video, right?  Huh?  That's a fan video  I believe so, yeah  It's not the official video  I like it, but I don't like the 
[00:08:00]  The darkness of it  I don't mind that, but I just  I don't like the lack of a melody  It makes any sense  Like, I like the way  I mean, it's not about melodies, really  No, I know  It's just  Yeah, he just likes it  It's very plodding and just droning  Doom and groom  Yeah, it's very dark  Doom and groom  Jesus  That's what I felt like on my wedding  There you go  Thanks for saving me  Just, but you know what I mean?  It takes the hope out of the original song  Yeah  Certainly 
[00:08:30]  Good  It's not a happy little song  It's not a happy world  No  Let's not make believe it is  No  It's basically what he's saying  It stinks  I got to thank my buddies at the Apple store  Why?  He took care of me  What was wrong with your other phone?  I like the crack  Remember?  The crack in the back?  Why did you get rid of it, though?  The crack?  Because, um  The crack in the back wasn't bad  It gave it personality  I kind of liked it  It had a  A shatter 
[00:09:00]  On the back corner  And it went up  And a little  Little spider web  Pattern  On the back of my iPhone  And it kind of looked cool  It looked like  The iPhone was through some shit  Yeah  It was in the shit  And then, uh  I go home yesterday  I go out back  Kind of a nice day  I sit on one of my chairs out back  Just to relax a little bit  And, of course  I crap right out, you know  And I had my phone in my hand  When I woke up  My phone's not in my hand  It's on the ground  Which is, you know  Cement 
[00:09:30]  I pick it up  It had fallen flat on the face  And completely shattered the front of the iPhone  It was just completely shattered  More personality  But you know what?  It worked  The damn phone still worked  You should bring it back in  And say, look  I just took it out of the box  There's something wrong with this  I took it in  And, uh  Yeah, they replace it  That's what they do  But if it happens again  I don't know  It might be a little rough  So, I was trying to find  Some kind of case  I could use for it 
[00:10:00]  But, uh  They were all out of cases  And backed up with orders  For this and that  And the other thing  What's going on with Apple today?  Because I drove by a store  And there's a line out front  There's always a line out front  Why, though?  I mean, the store's not opening for hours  It's not like  The store's opening within the hour  And people decide  Ah, you know  I'm here  Might as well wait  For them to open  And the line sort of went  Halfway around the block  Is there something new being released?  I didn't hear about it  Or is it a place where  Just the kids are hanging out now?  People love going down there 
[00:10:30]  I don't know  It really is amazing  It was a little strange  Also, yesterday  We talked about the BlackBerry Torch  Yep  Although I'm not happy with the phone  No, I did not get it  I guess the story of it being 50% off  Is slightly wrong  That was wrong  Now, how did that end up being wrong?  Because it was everywhere  I guess one blogger  Or one website went with it  And everyone else jumped on it  That's the world we live in now  Gizmodo, right?  One blogger can say something  And it's news  Do we blame Gizmodo? 
[00:11:00]  Because I think they had a  I think it was  I don't remember  It was based on  I don't know  One guy's Photoshop?  I want to say that, really  That's pretty much what it ends up being these days  Yeah, but now there's no sign of that  On the website anymore  Really?  Yeah  Although it's still getting horrible reviews  What are they saying is wrong with it?  CNET.com is calling the iPhone killer archaic  Yeah, because it's got buttons  They're calling it archaic  Stop with your buttons 
[00:11:30]  It's somewhere in the middle  It's a good phone  It's not a great phone, I guess  They're such assholes  Huh?  Blackberry is such assholes  I don't know what their  I don't know what their problem is  They're just dicks  At this point  They could have figured something out  Yeah  You know, the iPhone's been around a while now  You know, it's been around long enough  To rip the fucking thing apart  And see what they're doing  And make your own version  That's what the world does now  No one wants to slide a phone anymore  And have a keyboard there  No one wants to do that 
[00:12:00]  Yeah  It's a bomb  So  Terrible  Still trying to figure out what to get  Yeah  I don't feel like changing from AT&T  I don't get dropped  My calls don't drop  In your house  It doesn't even come through  No, in the house it's even gotten better  I don't know what they did  But now I get phone calls in my house  Which is nice  Then if you have AT&T and you like it  You should absolutely have an iPhone then  Nope  Oh, you should  Out of principle, nope  What's the principle?  I just don't want to join the cult 
[00:12:30]  It's the best cult around  No, it's not  Oh, it certainly is  I don't want a phone made out of glass  That's going to shatter  When it falls out of my pocket  That is true  I wish they would not have made this out of glass  You got the wrong case  This case  I've dropped this phone  I got no case  I've dropped this phone  It doesn't shatter  But it makes it so big  Now Danny's showing me the torch at  You could get one for $99 half price  Yes, you can get one  So what website is that off?  Foundry  It's a little known website called Amazon 
[00:13:00]  Amazon  That's a big site there  So what the fuck's going on?  Oh, literal, Jim  Because then they were  I haven't heard any updates  I mean, as far as I'm concerned  It's still  I was still going with the half off  Story until you just mentioned that  Well, then Blackberry or somebody came out  They don't want the world knowing  That their phone is already half off  So they pushed back  But it's pretty obvious  That they're selling this thing for half price  If it's on Amazon  Amazon's selling it for half price  AT&T isn't  Of course  So I think that's where the confusion lies  All right 
[00:13:30]  Well, it doesn't sound like it's a phone  That's going to take over the world  No, it's not going to take over anything  It's based on specs alone  I know  It just can't  I mean, the processor in that phone  Isn't even up to par with what's coming out  Right  Even what's coming out  What was coming out a few months ago  So  Yeah  And they're really touting that phone  For media and entertainment  And there's not even really a processor in there  That can handle the entertainment  That they want you to use it for  Plus the screen isn't as impressive  As it could be  Look up Pebble  What are they up to? 
[00:14:00]  They got something coming out soon  You're still sticking there  Yeah, why not  With the Pebble  I'm sure they'll have some kind of tablet phone  Soon  And then  What is this?  I heard a rumor of a smaller iPad  Yeah  Really?  Well, that makes sense  I remember reading somewhere  That in the developer kit  For some of the new Apple software  They saw some lines of code  That kind of hinted towards  A second iPad  And also a CDMA iPhone  Which would mean Verizon 
[00:14:30]  Ooh, speculation  More Verizon iPhone speculation going on  They already have  They have a contract  They can't  Until the contract is on  Yes  Right  But, you know  A couple of years have gone by  So  Contract's going to run out  Yeah, there's some weird  There's some wacky shit going on  That's making me  Turn the page on that one  Yeah  Why in this stage  In Canada  You can use different carriers  Why here  Because Canada's silly  Do we allow that?  Like the cable companies  And the phone companies 
[00:15:00]  Like why the fuck do we  I guess because they're a private company  They're allowed to do it  Flexivity, yeah  It's so annoying though  I know  Kind of want to make your own churse  Yeah  Everyone's just saying  The operating system  Is just real slow  They got their torches  And not happy  Not happy with the operation  We could have told you that  It's going to suck  Operating systems  Excuse me  Yeah  What are you doing?  Is it Windows?  Huh?  Is it Windows?  Windows Mobile  I don't even know  CJ in Atlanta  CJ  I have a WAP browser  I hated the WAP browser  CJ  It's racist 
[00:15:30]  Good evening  What's up CJ?  I just wanted to tell Ant  I understand what you're saying  About nobody wanting a keyboard  But people like me  Who have fat  Obnoxious tree frog thumbs  Can't use the iPhone keyboard  Without having something  To actually hold on to  Like a button keyboard  And so I use an HTC Touch Pro  And until the iPhone  Has some sort of peripheral  That I can actually  Put my finger over a button  And press it  I can't get it  You're the exception to the rule  Old fat fingers  No  I got the fat thumbs too  No 
[00:16:00]  I can't put these in a bowling ball  How am I supposed to  Fucking type on a screen like that  I text with one thumb  A lot of times  While I'm driving at  Grave speeds  Yeah but your thumb  Kind of goes  Comes to a bit of  Yeah but it comes to a tip  You could use the tip of your thumb  Mine are flat on top  I punched three or four  Fucking letters at one time  All you gotta do is  Hit the letter  If you have some carryover  On the other letters  The iPhone fixes it  And I barely look 
[00:16:30]  When I text  And I'm sloppy  I mean all over  But the iPhone  Just figures it out  These are bigger letters  By the way  Or just the same size  As the buttons  Yeah  And you get used to it  Everyone thinks  They can't get used to it  And you do  See the Blackberry  Has bumpy bumps  So I know where I am  Now the bumpy bumps  I call them bumpy bumps  The iPhone should make  An option to make  These letters a little bit  Bigger for guys  That have big hands  Like you should be able  To set the size  Of the letters  If you want  And people might be more  Yes you should Jimmy  Thank you sir  Well don't forget 
[00:17:00]  You could also landscape  You could type landscape  Yes you could turn it sideways  That kind of gives you  A little more space  To work  And it gives you  A bigger keyboard  I'm actually fighting  For men like that  On the phone  Does it give you  A bigger keyboard  Yeah  Well it  Oh damn let's not argue  It spreads it out a little more  So that it's a little easier  For people who  Who don't want to be  So confined  For men like who  Just call like this  Toe thumbed ass  That just called up  Oh yeah okay  It's a little better  Yeah that's bigger  But it don't really  Boils down to muscle memory  Because I really  Like there are some times  Where I'm not even looking 
[00:17:30]  And I'm typing  And I'm not misspelling anything  Did you just say muscle memory  Muscle memory  I mean it's accurate  Yeah  It's a perfect storm  Muscle memory  Yeah  Muscle memory  I know it's something  It just sounds weird  Sounds like it's something dirty  Muscle memory  Alright well  What's going on in the world today  Ah we lost Bobby Thompson  Huh  Ah  He was the one that  Did the shot hurt  Around the world  Oh yeah  Dies at age 86

[00:20:30]  The police  Are holding down  The Negroes  The 50s  Why was it so much  More exciting  Because there was  When your team won  Like that  Less avenues of entertainment  There was less  Things to focus on  The pennant was a much  Bigger thing back then  It really was  I fucking hate Dr. Laura  God do I hate that bitch  Are you  Taking that tack  On this one  Because I'm kind of 
[00:21:00]  With her on this  Hate her  I'm with her on this one  I'm not with her  On a free speech issue  I hate her guts  Oh okay  You could hate her  She's not a likable person  And by the way  What she's saying is  How she wants her  Free speech back  Unless you've been fired  And people aren't  Telling you that  You have your free speech  I see what she means though  You can't say anything  Without at least being  Persecuted  And called things  And being accused  Of being this and that  And the other thing  I think it's  I think it's good 
[00:21:30]  I don't like  She's stepping on  You know what  She's stepping out  Before it gets to the point  It would look silly  If she's getting fired  And she goes  Well I'm quitting radio  It's like  Well you got fired  She's actually leaving  Without anyone firing her  It's like  You know what  Fuck this  I don't like the way  People are talking about me  She absolutely has a right  To say what the fuck she wants  And not catch this kind of shit  From special interest groups  Then she should attack them  On her show  Then how about you go on your show  And then if they fire you  You go kicking and screaming 
[00:22:00]  She says  They're held hostage  For sponsors  She said the sponsors  Get hammered  The broadcast company  That owns your show  Gets hammered  She can't just sit there  And rip apart  The people that  Come in and attack you  We've been in that boat before  Then it does end in your firing  Because you don't seem  Contrite enough  So she's saying  Fuck this  I'm leaving  She's going to go  To some other venue  Where she has the ability  To say what she wants  She's got enough money  She's a cunt 
[00:22:30]  And I really  Really despise this  I don't believe her  Like it's not that  I don't think  She should get fired  At all  But I just don't  Fucking believe  I think she's a fucking phony  I don't know  And I think  That she loved saying it  And again  Fine  I don't have a problem with that  But I think that she's being  Disgusting  And phony  Because I think that she was  Trying to say it  I've always hated her guts  I really  I have a thing for her  I can't stand her  I'm going to give her  The benefit of the doubt  On this one  Can we back up though  Is she in trouble  Of being fired over this 
[00:23:00]  There were some people  That were very angry  She's weathering a storm  Isn't she  I guarantee media matters  Is after those facts  Yeah  But it doesn't sound like  It's an IMA situation  Where it's growing  It's calmed down  I'm confused by her  Because I don't think  She's going to get fired over this  Why doesn't she go on the air  And make her point  She doesn't have to say  Nigger again  But why don't I make her point  And go  You know what  The NAACP is contacting  My sponsors  Because she has  8 million listeners a week  When you have that kind of juice  How about you say  Fuck it  Oh don't bring the juice into it 
[00:23:30]  Jimmy come on  She was just talking  But how about you ask  Your people to hit back  At any advertisers  That walk away from you  I mean like literally  She has a tremendous  She has a lot more people  Listening to her  Than they're going to be able  To galvanize against her  It doesn't matter  You've been through this  Enough times to know  That doesn't matter  None of that matters  The amount of listeners you have  The passion of your listeners  It means nothing  When you're dealing  With a corporate  Fucking  Entity  That will  Cave in  Under any pressure 
[00:24:00]  By a fucking  Group  Especially with racism  I don't know  Do you remember  Our homeless Charlie thing  XM  Wanted to fire us  I remember sitting out  For 30 days  Yeah  Here's why  I think eventually  We didn't totally get fired  Because there was  Somebody pushing back  Debbie and that  People against censorship  Thing  These fucking message boards  Mock them  Like I'd be sick of  They saved our fucking jobs  Because they were the only ones  Who would like  Go on those shows  When Sharpton would be on  And bashing  All day they're racist  And they had a voice  Pushing back 
[00:24:30]  I think that was part of it  I think it was  A huge part of it  I think part of it  Was we were still on K-Rock  Nope  Yeah  Exactly  Because if we didn't have  Eric Logan in our corner  We were fired  It didn't matter  Hugh Pinero wasn't  Sitting at home  Watching Happy Typing Girl  On CNN  Going you know  She's making a good point  And pushing back for us  I'm not talking about that  I'm not saying Hugh Pinero  I'm saying K-Rock  Was going to dump us  Because we started to lose  K-Rock wasn't going to dump us  After we lost that  Fucking showboat thing  That sponsorship  K-Rock was not dumping us  Because it didn't happen  On the airwaves  They were looking at  That as an opportunity  At the time 
[00:25:00]  Like oh fuck  Because they wanted us  Full time  I think K-Rock  They were taking advantage  Of that going  God this is good for us  Because it didn't happen  On our airwaves  Yeah I didn't see it  Happening that way  After I think  The only thing  That helped us  Or the main thing  Was somebody  Was pushing back  There were protests  Outside  ONA fans were protesting  All of that  Gave just a voice  In the opposite direction  I would like to think  That's possible  But I don't think  I don't think  These douchebag managers  No no  Pay that close attention  To it  I don't have enough faith  I would like to believe  What you're saying Jimmy  But in my heart 
[00:25:30]  I don't believe it  I think that they  Were ready to walk  K-Rock man  We lost  I thought our careers  Were over  When we lost that  Fucking  We had an AC show  Tom Chiasano  Sat down with me  And Ant  Very early on  In that whole thing  And said  We're fucking  Behind you guys  It didn't happen  On our airwaves  That was his  Big headline  We don't care  It didn't happen here  But even though  It didn't  You're right  But the bottom  Even though  It didn't happen  There  It cost them money  At that point  He was hoping  To grab us away  From satellite  And have us full time  Didn't work out  That way obviously  But at the time 
[00:26:00]  We sat down  I don't know  If you were in that meeting  No they hated me  K-Rock hated me  Fuck them  They sat us down  Right away and said  We're all in here  Because it didn't happen  On our airwaves  But when they started  Losing money  If advertisers  Would have pulled out  K-Rock would have  Walked away  Because it was all  About that  They just didn't  Lose any advertisers  Because it didn't happen  But once that  Fucking one pin fell  We all thought  Everything else  Was going to come after that  It was horrible  Well that kind of  Makes the point  Now  Doesn't it  What  It kind of makes  The point that  When shit like this 
[00:26:30]  Happens  You get that domino effect  But before you know it  You're out the fucking door  And Dr. Laura's saying  Fuck this  I don't need that shit  But people pushing back  Helps  Because you never hear that  Like when Imus was getting in trouble  Nobody pushed back  You're right  Nobody's  Because they were afraid  Imus' fans aren't like our fans  Our fans are degenerates  Who can go out there  And fucking  You know  Hold up signs  Imus' fans were  You know  Not going to get out there  And defend 
[00:27:00]  Nappy headed hoes  But they could have  Defended his right  To free speech  Or they could have  Defended something  People did  They came out  And said it  There was a constant  Debate on television  Between people that said  He has the right to say it  I don't think  He should have been fired  But the biggest voice  Was the people  That were playing  The race card  And they were the ones  With the coverage  And you know how  The news gets the  Feeding frenzy  They see which way  It's tipping  And they'll go on  To that side  And try to fucking 
[00:27:30]  Beat the shit out of you  But people  Again  People pushing back  And saying  Look it's satellite radio  It's supposed to be uncensored  Those things were being said  We weren't allowed to say them  And it just helped  To have somebody saying them  When people see  A pushback  It helps a lot  But you never see that  Because the people  Who are getting fired  Yeah the fans  Just kind of like  Eh it happens  I'm telling you  People see that  It means something  It was a big pushback  For Sex for Sam  We were at the  Fucking pinnacle 
[00:28:00]  We had a lot of shit  Going on  And got thrown  Right the fuck  Out on our asses  And no one wanted  To hear it  They didn't want  To fucking hear it  Yeah there was  A major pushback  By the fans  There's  I don't  I have any faith  In management  When it comes to  I'm so with you  When it comes to  The audience  Pushing back  They just go  Fuck it  To them  They don't care  They don't see an audience  They look at  Fucking spreadsheets  They look at  Who's complaining  They see the path  Of least resistance  And if it's  Lopping off people's heads  That's it 
[00:28:30]  You said it  The path of least resistance  And that's always  The ones complaining  Are always the least  Resistance  But when there are  Two sides fighting it  It just helps  I'm not saying  To me  I remember that  And I remember seeing  On the news  There was footage  Of fans outside  Protesting  Breaking their satellites  Look it was a little  Dramatic  But at least it said  Like this is a bullshit  Thing that's happening  And you normally  Don't see that  From fans  I would like to think  That that helped  I know I would too  I've experienced  Management way too  Fucking  For way too 
[00:29:00]  Fucking long  Yeah  Way too fucking long  Yeah I have no faith  In them actually  Looking at the bigger  Picture like that  And making a decision  Based on a show's  Popularity  Context of the comment  This that  Whether the interest  Group is legitimate  Or just fucking  Troublemakers  They don't see enough  They don't care enough  They're not as  Involved in it  And invested in it  As we are  Right  And as the fans are  So they'll pull  The plug in a second  When I say  Fan pushback 
[00:29:30]  I don't mean  They care about  The listeners  I mean they look  At it from  This is a piece  Of our base  And it's a  Financial interest  Whenever they hear  Advertisers complaining  Or special interest groups  They only hear  It's going to cost us money  They don't give a fuck  About anything  Other than it's going to  Cost them money  When they think  It might cost them money  To make the other decision  Because they see  A pushback  They realize  Oh this could cost us  Money as well  That's why it gives them  Pause  It's not about them  Caring about the fans  They don't  I don't know  The costing money thing  Too is all relative 
[00:30:00]  When you get a company  That'll hire David Lee Roth  For millions of dollars  Have them on for a couple  Of months  And then pay out  The rest of his contract  You get people  That just go  Well it's the cost  Of doing business  So  Do you remember  When Letterman apologized  He apologized  After that first  Advertiser pulled out  That was when Letterman  Came out and apologized  For the Palin comment  It was after  It was some  It wasn't even  A gigantic sponsor  But when they pulled out  He saw what was  About to happen  Which was the advertisers  Were going to start going  And he fucking came out 
[00:30:30]  Yeah  You know  Because once that happens  You're fucked  The whole situation  With K-Rock  They lost one sponsorship  Because we were supposed  To do a poker tournament  Yeah  But they were able  To tell the rest  Of the advertisers  Relaxed  This did not happen  On our airwaves  And that's the only reason  We weren't fired  By K-Rock  It had nothing to do  With the fans  It just didn't  It just didn't  I don't agree  I would love to think  That that matters  But I've sat in front  Of these suits  For well over 20 years  They're a bunch of  Douchebags in the end 
[00:31:00]  They really are  But I'm not saying  They're not  They really are  They're terrible  When we got fired  For Sex for Sam  They had a million reasons  To keep us  Our ratings were ridiculous  We were number one  By far  Bringing in shit loads  Of fucking money  And they fucking  Didn't even try  To fucking save us  They didn't even try  And we were never hotter  Than we were  In that period of time  With this radio show  And that was a lot of money  In advertising  That they lost  Based on their own decision  Not even based on  The sponsors pulling 
[00:31:30]  By them pulling us  They pulled every sponsor  We had  Do you remember  Watching those shows  There was not one person  Sticking up for the show  That's what I'm saying  There was not  All you'd hear  Was these guys  Bashing the show  And not one voice  In the other direction  And that was management  They chose not to  Fucking do anything  Yeah  They chose not to  Hire a PR company  Or something  To get their message  Out there  They chose to  Just bail on us  And I'm telling you  We were massively successful  Dude I remember 
[00:32:00]  We had something like  A 30 or 35 share  In Cleveland  You just don't get rid of that  In radio  They certainly did though  That was a first  And the fans were out there  Protesting and doing  Everything they could  And God bless them  And I hope they continue  Doing that for us  But I have no faith  In management  I lost my faith  In management  The day they fired us  For the Sex for Sam  Yeah  Well I lost all faith  Because they didn't even  Sit down and try to  Figure it out  At all  But faith in management  I agree with you  I have none of them either  None 
[00:32:30]  None  They're not creative people  They're not  Most of the times  I didn't find them  To be people with integrity  Or  I'm only thinking of them  Looking at their own  Self-interest  And what makes a person  Examine  What's in my best interest  A lot of times  A lot of times  They won't even do that though  They'll  The proverbial  Cut their nose off  To spite their face  They'll  They'll fire us  Even though firing us  Will cost them  A fuck of a lot more money  They paid us  To sit on our ass  For two fucking years 
[00:33:00]  Right  That costs money  They paid us  While we were bringing in  No revenue  For two fucking years  Every sponsor  Could have pulled  But one  And they still  Would have made more money  Than they would have  Made  Having made the decision  To let us go  But it wasn't  Do you remember  That the push  Was not just KROQ  I'm sorry  N.E.W.  Because it was Infinity  Owned by Viacom  They were threatening  All the advertisers  For all the other people  Under the fucking  Corporate umbrella  So it was a financial decision  Yeah but still  How effective 
[00:33:30]  Would that have been  If they were so smart  In knowing  Where the money was  And how effective  These interest groups are  Wouldn't they have just said  Fuck it  Then nothing's gonna  Materialize  If they were smart  Yeah but they're dummies  Yeah that's what we're saying  They're dummies  And they can't be  Looked at  To back a show  Or back a personality  And that's why I think  What Dr. Laura's doing  Is great  Good for her  Jack Cafferty  Didn't get fired  Well you know what  Jack Cafferty  Who else did they  Just weathered the storm  Recently too 
[00:34:00]  Who just had a thing  Where they  It's very hard  To fire  Somebody like  Jack Cafferty  Like Hannity  It's very hard  To fire  People that are  Basing  Their shows  On political opinion  Right right  And things  Because that really  Looks like  You're infringing  On the first amendment  Rights of people  Comedy shows  Entertainment programs  Whole nother fucking animal  You could dump them  But who just  I'm trying to remember  Somebody just  Weathered a storm  I hate to say it like that  Yeah  But nothing happened 
[00:34:30]  And we even said  Look this is what  You should do  Just hang in there  And people go away  Right right  It was a Reverend Al  Thing wasn't it  See there's a  There was the cartoonist  In the post  That Reverend Al  Went after  Nothing happened  And the post  Just said  Go fuck yourself  They basically told  Reverend Al  To go fuck himself  And Reverend Al  Had to just walk away  He just faded  Into the woodwork  What happens is  But there was  Somebody else recently too  And we said  Just hang in there  And everything will be okay  These guys all watch  The same talking head shows 
[00:35:00]  We do  These dummies  That make these decisions  And again  When they see  Four people  Killing a show  And no pushback  When there's somebody  There making a point  And it's a debate  It's a lot  Because they're dumb  They're watching  The same things  That we're watching  At home  Remember we were watching  Fucking Greaseman  And all these other people  Just bad mouth  And the only person  Speaking up for this show  Was Psycho Mark  And we made fun of it  But that was it  Right  At least he gave it a shot  There was no voice  At least he gave it a shot  You know  Yeah  I mean going back 
[00:35:30]  To the homeless Charlie thing  XM wanted to fire us  Eric Logan was big time  In our corner  Hugh Panera wanted us  Fired so badly  I know he did  I can't even tell you  How many phone calls  He made to me personally  Just to yell  And scream at me  Shut up  It was awful  And basically said  Have a tic-tac  And get the fuck  Out of here  He basically told me  That me and Ant  Need to have children  So we would have  A better understanding  Of how things work  Now I always wanted  To be a father  So I didn't take  His advice  Trust me 
[00:36:00]  You got a daughter  Fuck  But he wanted us  Fired so bad  And basically said it  On the phone to me  And then Erg Logan  You know in a way  Maybe put his ass  On the line  You know to save us  And then with KROQ  If a couple sponsors  Did bail  We were done  But they were able  To tell their sponsors  Look this didn't  Happen here  Everything's going  To be okay  And they were thinking  Fuck maybe we could  You know yank  These guys away  From satellite  And have them full time  Because at the time  We were bringing in 
[00:36:30]  Some nice ratings  Not the ratings  I'm always honest  Not the ratings  We had at NEW  But we were doing  Very well for CBS  When we were doing  Mornings for them  Yeah  The problem was  They were splitting us  With satellite  And they needed us  Full time  And they couldn't  Figure that out  In the end  So  Like you just said  If any more  Advertisers went  And I think that's  What helped  Well you're right  They told the advertisers  Look everything's okay  It just  For whatever reason  It didn't tip  We got very very lucky  And I think one of the  Again I'm not saying  That I shouldn't have said  That the only reason 
[00:37:00]  We had the gig  Was the fans  That was probably  Wrong and stupid  But the fact is  That might have been  I remember watching  Those shows  And going I'm so happy  Somebody is at least  Making  An intelligent woman  Absolutely  Is making a point  In our defense  Yeah  There's no one  Gets that  I don't want to be  I don't want people  Confused out there  What Happy Typing Girl  Did for us  I completely appreciate  And there's a lot of them  With her  And the fans  Breaking their radios  And all that  I appreciate all that  Absolutely  All I'm saying is  I don't have faith  In management  And the day I have  Faith in management again 
[00:37:30]  I got to walk away  Because that's just  A dumb thing to have  I don't either  I don't either  I can't really  Get into it  But we have to do things  For this show  On Sirius XM  That proves that  I can't even get into it  Fuck  Well you know what  I'm talking about though  Yeah yeah  Well we have to  We have to protect  Ourselves now  Yeah  Oh yeah yeah yeah  There was a time  We didn't have to do that  It wasn't even  A thought process  Yeah  See it's got to stay vague  I know what you mean though  But trust me 
[00:38:00]  You know  We have to do things now  To protect ourselves  Even though we work  For a company  I just think  To bring it back around  With the Dr. Laura thing  I think  Even though  Look  I never liked her  I never paid attention  To anything  She's rambling about  I couldn't tell you  Anything  I haven't listened to her  I just see it  For face value  And I hate saying that too  Yeah yeah  That  I think it's a  A good move  I think it shows like  Fuck you 
[00:38:30]  I do have a fuckload  Of listeners  I'm not right here  On the brink of being fired  I don't think she is  I don't think so either  I think again  With her type of show  It would really come down  As a First Amendment issue  She's not doing  Fucking wacky comedy  And I think  It's  I think  It's a brave move  To walk away  And say  No  Go fuck yourself  I'm leaving  Because I want to be able  To say what I want to say  Without this horse shit  I hate her  Because I think  That she's a contrived 
[00:39:00]  Contraption  Like  After  When those nude pictures  Of her service  I believe she lied  At first  You know  Miss Honest Radio  Said she had shaved  I  No  That wasn't  That wasn't my pussy  It was the big ragu  In my lap  But I think that was  And that's why I hated her  Because there was photos  I was just  No that's not me  There's no photos of me  So I've just always  Had a hatred of her  Yeah  Because to me  She's extraordinarily  Self-righteous  And holier than now  And to me  I think she's a phony  And when she said nigger  Again I think she had  The right to do it 
[00:39:30]  But I watched somebody  Who I thought  Was trying to shoehorn it in  And then go  What?  What did I do?  It's like  You weren't trying to be funny  You were trying to shoehorn it in  And it just annoyed me  Yeah  Yeah I'm not a fan  Of Dr. Laura  And I don't think she's  I think I'm right in the middle  Of what you guys are saying  I'm not a fan of her  Whatsoever  But I also think  That she's not even  Close to being fired  Maybe she just doesn't  Want to do the radio  Maybe  And she's using this  As a way to get out  As far as what  Jimmy's saying though  I don't know  See that's just it 
[00:40:00]  I don't know her show enough  To know if she was doing that  If she was  Like  In context  I heard that call  I know exactly  What she was doing  During that call  Had she done shit  Like that before  Was this just  This one instance  Where she thought  I think I got  A good opportunity  To fucking freak people  Out and shit  Or  Was her show like this  I don't know  I don't know  Here's what I didn't like  About why I don't like her  When that woman  Called up and said  You know my husband's  Friends are making 
[00:40:30]  Racial questions  Annoying  She said a legitimate point  That would annoy me  On the other end  If I was white  And all these fucking  Black people  It would annoy me  And then Dr. Laura  Dude you with a job  Taxpayer motherfucker  But when Dr. Laura  Went right after her  And started attacking  Her sense of humor  Instead of going  Well that's a legitimate point  And then she's going  After HBO  And Def Jam  It was like  There was something  So like  She was looking for  An excuse to say this  And that woman's call  Was her excuse  Because then she goes  If you don't have  A sense of humor 
[00:41:00]  Don't marry outside your race  What the fuck  Did that have to do with it  And in all the years  She's been on the air  She's never gotten  A call  Where she had the opportunity  To unload like that  Or she just decided  On that day  She was going to  Who knows  Maybe she watched  Some interracial porn  She strikes me  As the type  Who would be  She strikes me  As an elitist  Who would love  Black dick  Her point wasn't  Well thought out  It stunk  It really  I mean  But I don't think  She should be fired  I don't want anybody  Killing me for that  She should absolutely  Not be fired for her  Oh yeah 
[00:41:30]  Of course not  Of course not  Whether I like her  Or not  I don't think  She should be fired  Over what  You know  What she said  She was on  Larry King last night  So why don't we  Roll into this audio  Why don't we  I just read that  When we came in  That's why  I just  She's after the  N word flap  She's got a voice  That's a little bit  Different than what  Ours was  The type of show  That this show is  Yeah  Like she got a lot  Of shit from the gays  In 2000  When she said  That that was a  Deviant lifestyle  Or it was a mistake  Look at the things  This show has said  That nobody gives a fuck about 
[00:42:00]  Because it's a comedy show  Or you know  Even a show  Any other giant show  You want to name  They can say  When she says things  People take it very  Right of course  Seriously  But when she explains it  They also take it seriously  Of course  So here she is  On Larry King last night  The one thing you said  That was interesting  You said that  On HBO  Black comics  Use the N word  Rap music  But  But  Jewish comics  Can kid Jews  Hispanic comics  George Lopez  I hate you Larry King  Larry you're wrong  Jewish comics  Can kid  You're completely wrong 
[00:42:30]  Larry  When is he retiring  They can kibitz  With each other  Instead of just admitting  She does have a point  About when you say  Something with melanin  It's taken different  I think her point  Was valid  Right  Kid Jews  Hispanic comics  George Lopez  Kids Hispanics  All the time  Gay comics  Kid the gay situation  Kid  It's okay isn't it  But not okay  When the non  N person  Uses it  Jesus  N person  So you're saying  The non nigger Larry 
[00:43:00]  Larry just said  It's okay when  The non nigger  Says it  You dummy  He should have said  African American  If he wanted to  The non nigger  Yeah  The non n word  Is he amazing or what  What an asshole  The non n person  The non n person  That's what you call  Black people  N person  Look at that  N person  But that's  What a fucking horrible  Racial discussion  That is just by the  Language he's using 
[00:43:30]  And this fucking show  And this fucking show  Is shown all over the world  What an embarrassment  To America  People fucking  Watching this shit  And Larry  That's what Larry  Thinks of black people  The non n person  N person  An n person  Yeah he should sit  African American  Black or black  Black comedians  Right  But the non n person  You see how flustered he got  He couldn't figure out  What to call him  It's okay isn't it  But not okay  When the non 
[00:44:00]  N person  Uses it  Well I was trying  That is great  You dunce  I'm gonna miss Larry  Really gonna miss Larry  The non n person  Fucking asshole  I'm just an old K  What do I know  When the  You know  The F's  When they're not  F'ing each other  In their A's  And he did say 
[00:44:30]  Yes the gay situation  Yeah  You didn't hear that part  The gay situation  What's the gay situation  Larry  You didn't hear that  Look this gay situation  Is very touchy  We might have to start over  Because gay comics  Talking about  The gay situation  One thing you said  That was interesting  You said that  On HBO  Black comics  Use the n word  Rap music  But  But  Jewish comics  Can kid Jews  Hispanic comics  George Lopez  Kids Hispanics  All the time  Gay comics 
[00:45:00]  Kid the gay situation  It's okay isn't it  Better than  But not okay  When the non  N person  Uses it  N person  I've seen a lot  Of gay comics  But if you're  A non  Sea sucker  There's a problem  Comment  I still don't know  The point he's  Trying to make  It's an ass  It's watching someone  That's what a white  Person sounds like  Discussing race  Right  Scared 
[00:45:30]  Petrified  Letters  And innuendo  And dancing around  Instead of saying  Look  Blacks kid blacks  Do you think  It's different  When you said  The word nigger  Than when black comics  Said it  How about just  Being honest  You're on a news show  You fucking asshole  N word  It's not  The non  N word  Person  God oh  What a  Ugh  Yeah  Ugh  Well I was trying  To make a point  To help her  About what I felt  Can you stop that  No you weren't  You weren't trying 
[00:46:00]  To help her  You fucking bitch  You weren't  You didn't even let  The girl said  I'm getting these  Racial things  And you're like  Really well  Black comics say nigger  What does that got to do  With her fucking  Husband's friends  Asking her a bunch  Of black questions  It's annoying  Yeah  Yeah I agree with you  You phony bitch  I completely agree  One  N person  Uses it  Well I was trying  To make a point  To help her  About what I felt  Because that  About her  Hypersensitivity  And 
[00:46:30]  In general  In America  Our hypers  What is she  Talking about  There you go  In general  In America  This issue  Had been  Bothering  Dr. Schlesinger  And she didn't  Have a place  To say it  And she found  A little entrance  And she took it  This woman  Didn't say anything  That implied  She was hypersensitive  I have such a hard time  Taking you seriously  With egg on your chin  Dude I always have  Egg on my face  And believe me  It's not egg  Yes 
[00:47:00]  Hello  I have some  On my chin too  Do you know  What I mean  Not on the  Come on my  Chinny chin chin  I'll huff  And I'll puff  And I'll blow  All your friends  By the way  Who is your house  Down  Because I'll blow  Him too  That's Frank  Your house down  He's a German  I'll huff  And I'll puff  And I'll blow  Your house down  Mr. Your house down 
[00:47:30]  I'll put my mouth  Around the chimney  And suck smoke  Into my lungs  The three little twinks  I don't know  You know  Listening to her  I uh  Yeah  She sounds a little  Contrived and phony  And all that shit  That she's I guess  Been over the years  Like I said  I'm not very familiar  With it  But she's got enough  Plausible deniability 
[00:48:00]  Here where  She'd have  Squeaked through  You'll squeak  By Spicoli  She's got enough  Where she'd squeak  Through  But for her to say  Look I've had it  With this shit  I have  Plenty of FU money  And she's leaving  I don't see anything  Wrong with that  I think it's great  Good  She's making a point  She didn't know  How to have that  Discussion  Because  And my  My thing is  I  My opinion  We've had plenty  Of black and white  Discussions on this show  No  I think that 
[00:48:30]  I mean off the air  She didn't know  How to have that  Discussion  Because she probably  Doesn't have them  With blacks that often  Um  It was just a weird  Thing to listen to  Because she was not  Trying to help  That woman's  Hypersensitivity  Because to me  That woman  That woman did not  Sound like a raving  Lunatic when she called  My husband's  White friends  Looked at me  And asked a black question  She didn't say that  She was like  Every time they come over  It seemed kind of rational  Didn't seem hypersensitive  Right  I don't know  Again  Just based on what 
[00:49:00]  I know about  What we do  A lot of times  Conversations are very fluid  They fucking  Go from one thing  To another  This woman calling in  Could have started out  As  Alright  I don't like the way  My husband's friends  Come over  And talk race  To me all the time  And then it kind of  Takes this weird  Fucking turn  And  Dr.  Fucking  Schlesinger  Dr.  Mengele  Is saying what  She wanted to say  And she  You know  Maybe  Maybe she did  Have an agenda  That day  And wanted to  Get into that area  And saw that 
[00:49:30]  As an opportunity  To  Kind of change  The  Gist of  That conversation  But  I don't know  Sometimes when people  I think when most people  Are characters like that  And they don't speak  From the gut  When something finally  Flies out from the gut  They don't know how to hide  How ugly it is  Like  It's almost like  If you were just talking about  We were talking about  You're like  Yeah I married  Interfaith marriage  Say some  Some  Woman called up  Say my husband's Jewish 
[00:50:00]  And this and that  And then a middle lady  Boo  Of course we would boo  But it was like  A minute later  You talk about the Jews  And how they run banking  It would be like  That wasn't connected  To what she was saying  And that was just  That just touched off  That thing that you  Were dying to say  Let's get through this here  What I felt  Because that  About her hypersensitivity  And  In general  In America  Our hypersensitivity  About race  Instead of us feeling  More like  E pluribus unum  And  I made it poorly  And so  I upset some people 
[00:50:30]  I offended some people  I hurt some people  And  Within 15 minutes  Which is what I had  To finish  The hour  I took myself  Off my show  For the rest  Of the day  Because I was so upset  Because I realized  I had blown it  I didn't help her  By making that point  And  About 8 o'clock  That night  I had sent  An apology  That I was  Going to do  In the morning  On my show  To LARadio.com  So it wasn't  Until 48 hours later  That there was  A media brouhaha  About it  And I had already 
[00:51:00]  Policed myself  And  Apologized  Why are you  Taking yourself  Off the air  You phony  You phony  Why didn't you  Go back on  You have a radio show  Dummy  But you want to go  To LARadio.com  You fucking idiot  How about you  Go back on the air  A minute later  Miss Sincere  Miss Heartfelt  And go  You know what  That was really  Dumb  What just happened  And get right into it  Can that woman  Call back  And then  You want to have  A racial discussion  Have a real racial discussion  Yeah that sounded  Really funny  You phony bitch  Maybe she had  A pap smear  Scheduled or something 
[00:51:30]  Had to leave  The show early that day  You misogynistic bastard  Oh it's her pussy  Fuck her  I'm torn by this one  Cause I don't like her  I'm with Jimmy  I don't like her at all  I hate her  But I don't think  She should be fired  I really don't  I do not think  She should be fired  And you know  That helps Jimmy's point  Cause that shows  Some phoniness  She  I mean if you're  In a situation  And you got 15 minutes  Left in your show  Guess what  If it happened on this show  We're gonna take advantage  Of that 15 minutes  And try our best  To help our cause  Another hour  She's another hour  I think she had  Another hour after that 
[00:52:00]  She took herself  Off the air  Because she was upset  Get the fuck out of here  Cause I couldn't help her  Really  Is that what happened  Then you use the 15 minutes  To explain that  Yeah  You use your time  To help your situation  Before you don't have  Control anymore  Because as soon as  These mics go off  For the day  Guess what  You don't have control anymore  And you don't have a voice  And then the rest of the media  Jumps on top of you  And beats the shit out of you  She had 15 minutes  To help her cause  And she chose not to  For whatever reason  And an hour after that 
[00:52:30]  I think  I think literally  She had to finish the hour  Well she said 15 minutes  I don't know  No she had to finish the hour  And then I think  She took herself off the air  Like meaning  She probably had like  An hour and 20 minutes left  She finished up the 15 minutes  For the hour  And then stopped the show  As opposed to  Oh she made it sound like  She only had 15 minutes left  In the show  And am I wrong  I'm thinking that she had  Another hour or something left  I think she said  In the final hour  Yeah I can't  Can't figure  Let's make love  Talking about  All right  We'll go back to that  Let's see  Radio.com  So it wasn't until  48 hours later 
[00:53:00]  That there was a media  Bruhaha about it  And I had already  I hate her clipped voice  Her fucking accentless voice  I gotta go back a bit  Hold on a minute here  15 minutes  Which is what I had  To finish the hour  I took myself off my show  For the rest of the day  Because I was so upset  Because I realized  I had blown it  I didn't help her  By you know  Making that point  She sucks  She had 15 minutes  To finish the hour  And then she cancelled  The rest of her show  So  How about you open  A real racial discussion  There phony bitch  Exactly 
[00:53:30]  Phony bitch  Yeah you're a radio show host  Then you go on the air  And explain to everyone  How upset you are  Because you felt like  You'd blown it  Yeah  She sucks  Gotta collect yourself  Dr. Laura  You fucking phony  With a big pussy  I can't stand her  But dude do I want to lick it  And you could  And if you do a talk show  You could get a lot done  In 15 minutes  A lot  And then the hours  After that  Do you know how great  That would have been  If she had black callers  Calling in  Did she have a whole  Another hour or not  She had to  Because she said  I took myself off  For the rest of the day  I'm going to guess  She might have had 
[00:54:00]  Two hours left  But I'm betting  She had at least an hour  Take calls  Take fucking calls  Black people go  I think that was out of line  Why?  And then discuss it  And that to me  Would have served her cause  A lot  If she had a racial discussion  For that next hour  And really explained herself  She would have had black people  That agreed with her  You know what  I agree with you  I hear the word nigger  From black people  And it makes me angry  And then black people  She would have helped her cause  So much  If she had stayed on  That extra hour  And knew how to have  An honest racial discussion  Now I'm going to take on  Michael here in Bay Ridge 
[00:54:30]  Really Opie  You used the opportunity  To plead your case  Want to replay  Your last ever show  On WNEW  Now I could explain that  Because at that point  In time  And this is the  This is where we were  Very naive  At that point  In our careers  They did sit down  With us at first  And gave us an indication  That they were going to  Get us through this  And they were going to  Fight for us  And they were going to  Have like  You know  Some pushback  Okay  So we believed them 
[00:55:00]  At the time  And they said  The best thing we could do  To help the situation  Is to just avoid it  Do not talk about it  Do not talk about it  And avoid it for a day  And we did  Just that  Believing management  That they were going  To fight for us  And then it was  Painfully obvious  After that last show  We did  That we were  Completely fucking done  And that's why  Because trust me  If I knew that  Was going to be  Our last fucking show  Yeah we would have  Pleaded our case  Absolutely  But they did sit down 
[00:55:30]  With us  And say  Look man  You know  This is a fucking  Shit storm  And we're going to  Try to get through this  And then they quickly  Turned on us  For whatever reason  Boy were we stupid  Because obviously  It came down  From upstairs  That fire these  Fucking assholes  Okay  But we didn't know  That going into  Our last show  And that's why  Absolutely  Michael  Troublemaker  Asshole  Joe  Take a dick  In your mouth  Cock  Wow  All right 
[00:56:00]  Well there's  Troublemakers out there  I think about me  They don't know  The whole fucking story  Trust me  We would have  Fought for ourselves  If we knew  That was our last show  But they gave an indication  That they were actually  Going to do the right thing  And fight for their people  And that's why  Earlier  I said that was the day  That I lost all faith  In management  Man  And you realize  You can't trust them at all  Terrible  But we were very naive  Still at that point  In our careers  Very naive  Dr. Laura continues here  So you're still regretful 
[00:56:30]  Well of course  Anytime you do something wrong  You should be regretful  So what are you here  To tell us tonight  Well  I'm here to say  That my contract  Is up  For my radio show  At the end of the year  And I've made the decision  Not to do  Radio anymore  The reason is  I want to regain  My First Amendment rights  I want to be able  Oh my God  She's despicable  Oh my God  Unless management is saying 
[00:57:00]  We're going to fire you  Then you have it  But what do you  If no one has said  They're going to fire her  What First Amendment rights  Have you lost  You've still got your show  Sounds like she's just  Sick of radio  And wants to step away  It's not a First Amendment right  Which means  She either has a show  Or doesn't have a show  There's a middle ground there  She  What she  I think goes on to say  In the rest of the statement  Is that she wants to be able  To voice opinions  That don't  Fucking  You know  Get everybody  Riled up 
[00:57:30]  And  Fucking ready to  Come at you  With pitchfork  And torches  So why can't you do that  Like why can't she do that  She's using this  She can  She's showing that you can't  Because there's  It doesn't matter what you say  From who though  I haven't had much  I don't see it that way  I think she's using  Racial issues  I think she's using this opportunity  To step away  She sounds like  She just  Doesn't want to do radio anymore  Maybe  Or maybe she has  A better opportunity  And this is a great way  To fucking leave radio behind  And maybe she's gonna  Do a TV show 
[00:58:00]  Or something  Or is she a genius  Has she found a way  To say  I'm leaving  In the end of the year  And then advertisers  Go  Alright  Fine  And then at the end of the year  You can rethink it  After the holidays  Because the momentum  Is dead  There's no momentum  Behind getting you in trouble  She took the momentum  Out of the equation  That might be a way  To fucking stop  The landslide  Because I don't see  I don't see  The mainstream media  Jumping on this one  No  And trying to fucking 
[00:58:30]  You know  Get her fired  Like they did with  I just don't see it  And look at her on CNN  She looks like an old broad  Maybe she's got  Maybe she's got  Some health issues  And really needs to  Take care of those  Oh I hope she does  I hope she has a lump  That's half her weight  I hope it starts  In her fucking ears  And finishes in her ankles  I'm confused by this one Ant  I don't think she's  Stepping aside  Because she can't  Handle the pressure  I just don't see the pressure  Like I said  Has Reverend Al  Jumped on this one  Do we know  I don't think so 
[00:59:00]  Yeah  I don't think so  Let's continue  With this audio here  To do  Radio anymore  The reason is  I want to  Regain  My First Amendment rights  I want to be able  To say  What's on my mind  And in my heart  And what I think  Is helpful and useful  Without somebody  Getting angry  Some special interest group  Deciding this is a time  To silence  A voice  Of dissent  And attack 
[00:59:30]  Affiliates  And attack  Sponsors  I'm sort of  Done with that  We know that game  So if you're done  Why don't you  Use your time  To just fucking fight  Big hairy fucking muff  I bet you they're  Coming after her  Behind the scenes  Pretty heavy  But what bothers me  Is if you're going  To talk  Like you have a show  If you're a lot  Don't be such a coward  Go back on  If that's what's  Really happening  Go on and do  That kind of show  Talk about that stuff  But she's saying  You can't  But who said  You can't  She hasn't said 
[01:00:00]  Management's told her  Not to  But if she's  Ending her show  At the end of the year  She has nothing  To lose now  So I think  Well she's got to  Play out her contract  Alright so you got  You got three months  To take this on  And she probably will  With no  Well that's what  We'll have to wait  And see  If she  If she doesn't  If she stops  Talking about it  Then she's a  Complete fucking phony  But she has  Nothing to lose now  So she should be  Doing some pretty  Intense shows  From here on out  We'll see  Yeah I think  That she's  But who said 
[01:00:30]  You can't express  She's acting like  Her opinions  Are not allowed  To be expressed  And it's like  I don't  Where has that been  Unless management  Has told her  Don't  In which case  She should say  That on Larry King  She's  This is the difference  Between her and this show  She had a problem  She's on Larry King  Like she can talk  To the whole country  And it's on the news  Every day  She's her  Her response  Is heard  It's like  With this show  It didn't matter  You were yelling  Into a fan  With her  It's different man  She's got that  That fucking  What they see  As respectability 
[01:01:00]  In a legitimate show  So they listen to her  She can go on  Fucking  On  On any of the  Late night shows  And plead her case  She's quitting  Maybe she's just  She's giving up the fight  Had  Other things  That maybe  Never made the news  Just  Like  Management  Calling her in  Saying  Maybe yeah  These  The gays are after you  This that  The other thing  You know  And she's  Finally just saying  Fuck it  Had it  Yeah well man  There are plenty of times  You know  I've been in a situation 
[01:01:30]  Where I've thought  Like  Jesus Christ  Come on  Can't we just  Talk about that  You know  But  Management says  No  But she said  Stupid interest groups  She set herself up  Perfectly to now  Take on all that  Yeah yeah  Maybe she's  Nothing to lose  If she cares that much  She's a hundred years old  Right  She's a hundred  I would love to  Hear her radio show now  To see if she does  Take this on now  It'll be garbage  It'll be the same  Fucking  The same  Clipped 
[01:02:00]  Accentless speech  That it always is  The same  Contrived  Perfect  No location  Radio voice  I'm confused by her  I don't really know  What point she's  Trying to make here  Yeah I'm  Confused too  I just  I just always  Err on the side  Of the personality  I think  Instead of  Fucking  Management or  Interest groups  Dude I agree with you  This is not about  Thinking she should be fired  Or thinking that  Media matters  Is anything but  The garbage that it is  Or thinking that  Sharpton is anything  But the garbage he is  I just think that  She's a phony as well  Just because I  Don't want her fired 
[01:02:30]  Doesn't mean I don't think  She's a phony piece of shit  Alright  And here's the final clip  From Larry King  Last night  You're giving up  The one area  Oh  Of your fame  Oh my dear  I write books  I have blogs  I have my website  I have speaking engagement  When people think Dr. Laura  They think her radio talk  This is the area of the  This is the era  Of the internet  So you're going to do  Internet stuff  Oh yeah I am now  Why is your freedom of speech  Denied on radio  Well because  People can criticize  What you say 
[01:03:00]  You know when I started  In radio  If you said something  Somebody didn't agree with  Or they didn't like  They argued with you  Now they try to silence you  That's a great point  You know she did  That's a great fucking point  Yes she did  She's making some  Really good points for this  Give her that one  Maybe if  But I don't think  But I don't think the issue  See this is the problem  I'm having with her  I don't think  That the issue  Maybe it is for them  But to be her point  Was not such a  Controversial point  I don't think that she made it  She's right  If black people say 
[01:03:30]  Nigga it's acceptable  But if a white person  Says it  It's the  The end of the world  I don't know if anybody's  Criticizing her actual point  And maybe you know  Like she was saying  She's been in it  Enough years  To have seen the  Huge change  Where yeah  You used to be able  To duke it out  You know  I remember Bob Grant  Sitting there on the air  Duking it out  With the listeners  It didn't matter  What he was saying  Or what the listener  Was saying  It was a great  Entertaining brawl  That they would have  On the air  If they didn't agree  With something  And then it got to the point  Where you know  Bob Grant couldn't say 
[01:04:00]  Shit anymore  Because instead of  Yeah  Fighting it out  Some group would just  Try to shut you up  Let's not forget  You know  I go back to JV and Elvis  Getting fired over  An Asian fucking bit  When one of the guys  Was married to an Asian  Or fiance  Or whatever  I think married  JV's wife's Asian  Yeah  And they get  Fucking fired over that  And like you said  There was a time  You did the Asian accent  And had some fun with it  And made your jokes  I would love to know 
[01:04:30]  If she's been  I don't know if she has  I can't say  I guarantee  Like the parents  Television council  She is their style of radio  And it wouldn't  I would love to know  If she's ever been behind  Getting somebody else  In trouble for content  Maybe she has not  I can't say she has  But I'm wondering  Because she seems like  The type that's  You know  She says the right thing  And I'm wondering  If she's ever been  Involved in any kind  Of a push  To get anything in trouble  Or censored  Or thrown off the air  I don't know the answer  To that  Maybe somebody else does  And imagine Reverend Al 
[01:05:00]  He would have had  A field day with Bob Grant  Back in the day  Oh yeah  He would have had  A fucking field day  But Grant would have  Been able to argue with him  And Grant used to  Oh yeah  Grant used to beat the shit  Out of Reverend Al  Yeah  When Reverend Al was  You know  The big fat dope  That used to walk the streets  And instead of  You know  Taking his  His  What is his  National action  Network  Network  Yeah  To buy him  His suits  And lose some weight  And you know  Get legitimate 
[01:05:30]  Right  Mainstream media  And management  Gave him fucking power  Gave him power  Gave Reverend Al power  Now one of these guys  On TV  And of course  They would have to  Clean it up  You know  Not one of them  Would look at Reverend Al  And go  Shut the fuck up  Really  He was the biggest  Clown  Not one of them  Will do that  You're right  With his medallion  And his fat gut  Just walking around  The city  Making trouble  And blatantly  Lying about things  That happened  And then  Because  He gets a suit 
[01:06:00]  He moderates  What he says  To the press  But I don't think  His opinions  Of shit  Has changed  Please  He's a safe  Black guy  To have on TV  I'm telling you  They don't understand  That they're  It's like  It's like  With white people  And I'm not  Attacking liberals  But really  Like a lot of  The media elite  Quote unquote  They don't understand  That Obama  Is an elitist  He's an intellectual  Snob  But they don't  They don't think 
[01:06:30]  Deep down  Because he's black  That he can be  An elitist  And they don't  Think that a black  Guy can be  An intellectual  Snob  That's what  Obama is  He's a smart  Guy  He's got his  Nose in the  Fucking air  He's just one  Of those guys  And the media  Doesn't understand  That because  He's black  So what  He still can  Be an intellectual  Snob  Sharpton's a safe  Thing for them  He's this black  Clown  He's not a threat  To anything  He's somebody  That nobody  Will ever truly  Take seriously  He still has  That stigma  Of  The game of  Power though  Man  Of Tawana  Brawley 
[01:07:00]  And Mason  And Maddox  And Crown  Heights  He still has  That baggage  On him  That he can  Never shake  He'll never  He has power  To make noise  And get radio  Hosts in trouble  Right  But he doesn't  Have power  To ever go  Above a certain  Well that's the  Power I care about  Because it's in our  World  Yep  You know  Fuck  I was gonna say  More Dr.  Laura  Makes a good  Point here though  There was a time  You used to  Fucking  Not worry about 
[01:07:30]  Your words  As long as  As long as  You kept it  Within FCC  FCC was all  That you cared about  It's funny  These people  That yell and  Scream about  The FCC  Now  That's a joke  That's not  You don't have  To worry about  The FCC anymore  Don't worry about  A fuck slipping  Through  You have to worry  About your own  Fucking bosses  Yeah  Can I ask a question  About Dr.  Laura though  Somebody is so  Interested  Oh it's long  And hairy  But for somebody  So interested  In fighting it out  Why did you  Take yourself  Off the air  Early that day  When you could  Have just fought it out  Somebody who 
[01:08:00]  The old days  Of fighting it out  What happened  You had more time  On your show  But what she was  Saying is  And maybe she's  Incapable of doing this  I know you  Absolutely can get  On the air  And Jimmy could  You know  Make a viable  Argument for his  Side of the story  Maybe she felt  And that's why  She's taking  Herself off the air  Permanently  If she does  And why she  Took herself off  The air that day  She didn't have  The ability  And realized  She doesn't  Have the ability  Anymore  To go on the air  And voice an opinion 
[01:08:30]  Without stirring up shit  That's gonna get you  Fucked  So she took herself  Off the air  You know  I think that's  Whether it's right  Or wrong  Or phony  That is what  She's saying  That's why  She did that  I think she saw  She fucked up  Meanwhile  She should never  Have had to have said  Wow I fucked up  What bothers me  Is that she just said  Back in those days  People would duke it out  With you  Cause she's saying  She's mentioning  Fight it out  So if she's bringing up  Fight it out  Well then where  Where the fuck  Were you 
[01:09:00]  But she's saying  You can't do that anymore  But who stopped her  She took herself  Off the air  Unless she's a liar  She took herself  Off the air  Because you'll only  Get yourself in more trouble  These days  If you try to duke it out  And defend yourself  But following Jimmy's point  She could have at least  Done that  And said look  I can't even fight this anymore  She could have used that  15 minutes to say something  With the hour  For the rest of the show  To even say look  She could have used that  15 minutes to say  You know I remember a time  If we had a phone call  Like this  We would have duked it out  I'm sitting here  Knowing I can't do that anymore 
[01:09:30]  And explain her case  On her own show  Maybe she doesn't have  The ability to do  Something like that  Maybe she's not  That kind of broadcaster  But she's explaining to Larry King now  Which is confusing  I know  She could have done it  On her own show  Yeah  I think she could have too  Her message is very conflicting  It's back and forth  Because she's saying things  Like duke it out  And it's like  But you took yourself  Off that day  Unless she's lying  And management yanked her  You could have done  Another hour of racial discussion  And completely  You're both right by the way  Maybe realizing what she said  She thought maybe  She could just get in  More fucking trouble 
[01:10:00]  Maybe  If she opens her yap anymore  But then she should have  Just said that  But man with her  You know what I mean  Her listenership  Eight and a half million people  She has a massive  Fucking audience  And she's not a shock jock  Quote on quote  No  She has a lot more leeway  In language  Than we ever had  Of course  Of course  Here it is  When I started in radio  If you said something  Somebody didn't agree with  Or they didn't like  They argued with you  Now they try to silence you  They try to wipe out  Your ability to earn a living  And to have your job  They go after affiliates 
[01:10:30]  They send threats  To sponsors  That's their right too  Yes  But I don't have the right  To say what I need to say  My First Amendment rights  Have been usurped  By angry  Hateful groups  Who don't want to debate  They want to eliminate  Yeah but  Management could tell  Those fucking people  You know  We're not taking you seriously  But  She's making very good  The whole thing  Where Larry King says  The whole part  Where Larry King says  Well they have a right 
[01:11:00]  To do that  They do technically  But it's one step  Of separation  Away from completely  Censoring you  I hate when people go  Well you could say  What you say  But this group  Has an opportunity  To say what they say  No  They are getting you fired  They are saying  You can't say this  Or we will get you fired  Oh how will you get me fired  Well we'll use  Our First Amendment right  To do this  It's like  It's very  A weird gray area there  When somebody can  Argue their point 
[01:11:30]  Against your point  And have a reasonable  Debate  Or  They can have  A debate  And get you fired  Because they're not  They're not having a debate  Where both ideas  Are being heard  And hashed out  They're trying to  Exactly  Remove your ability  To say what  You want to say  To say what you want to say  Exactly  And that's very sad  Through threats  And mob tactics  Of sending  A virtual leg breaker  To your sponsors  And affiliates  And saying  Get this person off  Or you're going to be sorry 
[01:12:00]  That's not a First Amendment right  That is threatening  Somebody's livelihood  Based on what they're saying  And they don't have a right  To do that  They have a right to  But they shouldn't be listened to  They should not be listened to  No I don't think  They even have a right  To do that  I don't think  They have a right  To use  Mafia tactics  To send people  Over to your  Associates  And threaten them 
[01:12:30]  Guilt by association  To have you removed  For what you said  And threaten you  With your livelihood  That is not  Freedom of fucking speech  Bravo  It's not  It's a threat  It's somebody  Threatening your livelihood  With what they're saying  Here's what their argument is  And this is what  I've heard Sharpton say this  And this is where  He diffuses that point  Because it's been raised to him  He says well  And again I'm paraphrasing  But he's saying 
[01:13:00]  Well don't we have the right  To go to advertisers  And tell them  Where we're going to spend  Our dollars  If you're supporting  Somebody who is  Denigrating us  This is his thing  If you're supporting  By financing the show  That is denigrating us  Don't we the consumers  Have the right to go  We will spend our dollars  Elsewhere  Other than on a product  That goes into paying  Someone who is denigrating  That's how they justify  Their pushback  They don't look at it  Like they're removing  Your freedom of speech  So to argue with them  You have to ask 
[01:13:30]  Why don't you want  To have this debate  Why do you want me silenced  Instead of saying  They don't have the right to  Because that's how they say  Yeah we have the right to  That's how they paint it  For themselves  So they don't look like  They're fucking removing  Your freedom of speech  Well that's fucking semantics  That is a crafty  Phony fucking way  Of getting around  The fact that  You're using  Your organization  To strong arm  Sponsors and affiliates  To get rid of somebody  Based on what they're saying 
[01:14:00]  It's disgusting  It is  Because Reverend Al  Didn't accept  Imus' apology  If you remember  He needed  Imus fired  Imus should have killed him though  You know how disgusting that is  Oh yeah  He should have killed  On his show  He's so much smarter  Yeah Imus kind of blew it  I'm sorry  I apologize  Yeah he kind of blew it  But they didn't even  Accept Imus' apology  That's just disgusting too  They weren't going to stop  Until Imus was taken off  The fucking air  Simple as that  And you know  One of these days  I just hope management 
[01:14:30]  Is brave enough  To fucking  Don't give  Not to give these people power  And ride it out  What are the advertisers  She made a great point  But I think  She's still phony  I think  I think in her mind  She is moving on  To something else  And this is a perfect way  To fucking leave radio  To do whatever  She's got planned  She's hinting at the internet  She probably wants to  Take it all on  Right right  Herself  She has a fucking platform  Though  See the difference is  Like when this show  Gets in trouble  Larry King doesn't call 
[01:15:00]  Or whoever on  She can go on  And do Hannity  And like  You guys could too  But I'm saying  She has a tremendous  On this platform  To push back  And if she only has  A few months left  On her contract  She has no financial interest  Well we're not gonna pay you  She's got a fucking  Few months left  On her contract  So it's not like  This show that had  Two and a half years left  And like  What the fuck  Happens now  She's got Larry King  She has massive options  And she has an audience  That will push back for her  But she might be dramatic  With this whole thing  Going look  I can't do it here anymore 
[01:15:30]  So why don't you people  Follow me to my new venture  She'll be right  Look I'm gonna fucking  Hit the internet  I'm doing a fucking webcast  Whatever  Right right right  She could get on  I don't know if she'd get on  Oprah  But she could get on  She doesn't want to  Save her radio  Massive shows  But she doesn't want to  Save her radio career  Because I think she really  Has something else  In mind  Or she would  Or of course she would  If you have 8 million  Listeners and you're making  The type of money  Dr. Laura is  You're gonna fight  Right to the end  There's a reason to fight  But if you have something  Else in your mind  Like you know  I'm moving on  Then of course  You jump off right there 
[01:16:00]  Dramatic  Dramatically too  By the way  Maybe management  Gave her that opportunity  There's a few things  That could be  Happening behind the scenes  We should know  More than anybody  Whatever you see  And hear  Isn't the whole  Fucking story  Right  It's usually not even  A piece of it  There's behind the scenes  Shit going on  Maybe with management  Or maybe yeah  She wants to  Have this big  Ending  Before she leaves  To  Get some  Listeners  To a webcast  Or whatever the fuck 
[01:16:30]  She's doing  Who knows  Yeah  By the way  For  You know  It sounds great  To go  To the internet  But  Fast forward a few years  And they're gonna get  The internet too  Man  Somehow  Someway  They will  They just will  Look at the stuff  We can't do on satellite radio  This was supposed to be  You know  Well beyond  Unfettered  Yeah  Well beyond broadcast radio  And you know  A lot of the stuff  We did at NEW  On regular radio  We simply can't do  On satellite  And they're gonna do  The same fucking thing  To the internet  I don't know how yet  But they're gonna do it 
[01:17:00]  You know how they do it  They get you through  Your fucking  Through your  Web  Provider  Provider  Yeah  They go to the provider  And go  Oh you're putting  This kind of shit  On your fucking  Right  And then you can't  Go to the smut  Fucking sites  And use their  Servers  So it's really  There already  Are things going on  Where people go  I don't like seeing that  I don't like hearing that  You see all these  Popular websites  I don't need to name any  Oh of course 
[01:17:30]  The mania ones  They're policing themselves  Though already  Already this  Shit they just  Will not allow  On their sites  The issue with  The internet too  Is so weird  Because it goes  Into that garbage  Community standards  Argument  And like  There are certain  Trailers  I know when  Buttman  I'm telling you  Stalliano  Having those charges  Thrown out  Yeah  Was fucking  Why is he not  On Larry King  Yeah that's huge  That was a  Massive  Fucking win  Because they were  Using the same  Type of stuff  Like I think  It was a  Joey Silvera movie  About like  Squirting milk  Or some weird 
[01:18:00]  Shit that they  Found offensive  And it was  I believe  An internet trailer  And that was  Where it got  Scary because  Your internet's  In everybody's  House  Yeah yeah  So it goes  Through all  Communities  So you could  Violate the  Community standards  In Broward  County Florida  Yeah  But I think  That thank god  That was thrown  Out  This is where  The conservatives  I want them  Out  I'm happy  That they're  Not in office  Right now  Yeah when it  Comes to shit  Like this  They're  Assholes  We uh  The listeners  Fucking  I have a feeling  That the listeners  Are killing me  Telling me  That I'm attacking  Dr. Laura 
[01:18:30]  I don't know  No they're just  Saying she has  A nice hairy  Big slit  Dr. Laura is smart  She's playing the  Victim card  Like black people do  Well give her that  Okay  Management will always  Look down on talent  That is the god's  Honest  Oh god I wish  I could  Whatever  I think they're  Behind us  110%  Guys  Really  Do you  Do you  110%  110%  Ah they're good  I must try to 
[01:19:00]  Duke it out  And look what  Happened to him  But he didn't  Try to duke it out  Did he at first  What was the  Initial response  I don't remember  Did he get back on  And just like  I'm sorry  I did that  Did he say  I'm sorry  Immediately  I'm sorry  I did that  He apologized  He wasn't sorry  But he didn't  Fight back  In the sense  That when he was  On Sharpton's show  I thought he  Should have  Killed him  Imus going on  Sharpton's show  Should have been  Good enough  For Reverend Al  Sharpton  That's why he's 
[01:19:30]  A piece of shit  He knew even  With Imus  Coming on that day  He still was  Going to go  All the way  And get him  Fired  Absolutely  He didn't even  Have an open  Mind when  Fucking  Imus walked  Through that door  To do some  Radio on his  On Reverend Al's  Show  That's why  He's a piece  Of shit  And doesn't  Have an open  Fucking mind  Yeah  He was grandstanding  And going  Wow this is  Going to be  Even better  For me  He saw  The opportunity  He didn't even  Listen to Imus  That day  And then he  Had a stupid  Daughter in  The studio  With her arms  Pretty much  Folded 
[01:20:00]  With that look  On her face  Remember all  That shit  Is she a  Nappy headed  Ho  He was saying  I don't want  To put up  With any  Of that crap  Is that the  One that got  In trouble  With the cops  Danielle  Whatever the  Fuck her  Name is  Is that the  One  One of his  Daughters and  His ex-wife  I think  Got pulled over  Yeah I don't  I don't know  If that was  The same  To the cops  Yeah but  Lovely  But that's why  Reverend Al's a  Piece of shit  He never had  An open mind  In that situation  He was loving  The attention  And he was  It didn't matter  He was going to get  Imus fired  No matter what  But that was  Les  That should have 
[01:20:30]  Been good enough  When Imus  Went on his  Fucking show  Les Mundo  Did not have  To fire him  That showed  A lot  Yeah I know  They didn't  Have to  Yeah you know  I blame them  Too they should  Have hung in  There  Of course  But there  Was  One of the  Upper management  Guys was  You know  Was a black  Guy  NAACP guy  Yeah he was  Very into this  Whole Imus thing  And again  Getting him  Off the air  None of the  White people  Around him  Will ever have  A racial discussion  That's honest  And go look  We all know  Whatever it was  They would need  To say  They probably  Whenever a black 
[01:21:00]  Guy says racism  Especially in a  Corporate situation  All the other  White people  Are like okay  I guess you're  Right  Okay  Okay sure  Yeah  Because they don't  Have friends  Like Patrice  Or Keith  Or any of  These dumb guys  That we hang  Out with  Who we yell  Back and forth  And everybody's  Honest  But you know  What I'm saying  It's like  I'm never afraid  Of fucking  Having an argument  With one of my  Black friends  Because I know  I'm not coming  From a horrible  Place  Adam in Connecticut  We do have to  Break  But Adam writes  In America  We hate terrorism  But we love 
[01:21:30]  Economic terrorism  I hope after he wrote that  He struck a poll  All right  A lot of reactions  Maybe we'll go to the phones  After the break  The virus  Sirius XM  This is the  O.P. and Anthony Show  Why  Why  Says my car  As it was the first time  I said  You're down 
[01:22:00]  Why  Says my car  As it was the first time  I said  You're down  And no one  I ever want to know  But I'm very funny  A crime  In the wake  Of the night  Let's go right 
[01:22:30]  To the phones  We got a  Non-N-word  That wants in  On the Dr. Lord  Discussion  God, Larry  Non-N-person  Non-N-word  Yes  That's his name  Man  From Florida  What do you got, sir?  How you guys doing  I want to start  By talking about  I saw Reverend Al  On a panel show  Last night  On MSNBC  I wanted to tell you  What he said  But I was  I was curious  Did any of you guys  See him get his ass  Whipped back in the 80s  On the Morton Downey Jr. show  For calling another guy 
[01:23:00]  An Uncle Tom  Oh, wow  Can we find that clip?  No, I didn't  Morton Downey Jr.  Was one of the best  TV shows ever, man  Morton Downey ruled  Step up to the big mouth  Right  He was a clown  It was old  Fat Al  In a track suit  And it was another  Black activist leader  And he  On live TV  Called him  An Uncle Tom  And that guy  Jumped up  And rolled his  Fat ass  Out of the back  Of the chair  It was fantastic  Wow, I don't  Remember that, man  Wow, look at  The old  Remember now  My man is an 88 
[01:23:30]  You're gentle, sir  I took nothing  But crap from you  You made all kinds  You made all kinds  Of promises  About what you could deliver  Sir, you couldn't deliver  You couldn't deliver  It's his name  Steven  Don't talk about  You couldn't deliver  A quart of milk  You couldn't deliver  You couldn't deliver  A quart of milk  Tell me about this  Tell me about this  You probably  I had him  I had him  You chickened out  You chickened out  You were a coward 
[01:24:00]  You were a coward  Come here  Come here  You were a coward  You had Steven  And Dennis Quirk  We had him  And we wouldn't show  Because if you lie  I'll walk right at you  Because you know  That I called you  Ten times  Let me get back to you  Oh, damn  Leave us both alone  Leave him alone  Leave him alone  Leave him alone  He knows it's good TV  Leave him alone  Yeah 
[01:24:30]  There's the new owl  Yep  Threatening somebody  That's good  Let me come back  A little bit  Step up to the big mouth  I gotta find the other clip  But Morton Downey Jr.  Took on Reverend Al  You don't see anyone  Taking on Reverend Al  Like this  And that's the guy  Who was on the cover  Of Newsweek a few weeks ago  That guy that just jumped up  And grabbed him  And said I'll break your neck  Was this it?  Let's see what this is  Oh, man  Who's that?  That's Roy Ennis  Roy Ennis  Oh, shit 
[01:25:00]  He pushed Reverend Al  Right on his fat ass  Pushed him down  Oh, he did  He pushed him on his ass  I know Roy  He's fucking  Roy Ennis  Roy Ennis is great  Yeah  There you go  Morton Downey Jr.  Used to take him on  Roy's a smart dude, man  He didn't let him  Spew his horse shit  It really is refreshing  To watch these old clips  And remember what the old  Reverend Al was  Back then  Because no one  Would ever cut slack  To an old racist  You know  Oh, I'm a different person now 
[01:25:30]  Well, look at his history  His past  But Reverend Al  Just gets a pass  Like that  He's the media darling now  Speaking at the  Democratic National Convention  And everything  We need another  Morton Downey Jr.  To get in his face  On TV  Did he call Roy Ennis  An Uncle Tom?  Yeah, I think he did  I think Al did  He seemed like  I believe Roy is from  The Virgin Islands  Or the West Indies  He's not American  I mean, he wasn't born here  Yeah  I don't think  That means he's surly  But he's one of those guys  He's not though 
[01:26:00]  But he's not that guy at all  He's a fucking  He's a really smart dude  Sure, let's go back  To non-N word  Morty with the friggin'  Cigarette is hysterical  Because he wound up  Dying up lung cancer  But how great  He's just doing his TV show  Smoking butts  You're a coward  Brr  I remember he used to  Blow the smoke right  In some of the guest's face  If he didn't like him  He ruled  If you want to have fun  If you've never heard  Of Morton Downey Jr.  For some of the younger  People out there  Fucking check out  Some clips on YouTube  Didn't he start  He was an animal  Didn't he start  The whole fucking  Thing of all  These crazy 
[01:26:30]  Springer  He started all of it  Yeah  Then he got  Completely insane  What was it  The swastika  Swastika on his head  Because his ratings  Were going down  So he carved a swastika  In his head  In the bathroom  And came out  Like he was  Beat up by some  White supremacists  And the swastika  Was backwards  On his head  Which meant that  He did it himself  In a mirror  Asshole  Did he admit that he lied  I don't remember  How it all ended  Go ahead  Non-N word  Your next point  Well  Last night  On this panel show 
[01:27:00]  It was  A white host  And Al on the phone  And another guy  I don't know  You know  They were talking to  But Al said  All exactly  What you'd expect  And in fairness  To him  As much as I detest him  You know  He started out  Making kind of  A good point  About you know  That nobody should  She has the right  To say whatever  She wants  But kind of  The same point  You guys were making  Earlier  That it seemed  A little transparent  That maybe she was  Looking for an excuse  To be you know  Over the top  And really you know  Threw it out there  Excessively 
[01:27:30]  But then of course  He can't help himself  He gets into the good old  You know  Here we go  About the affiliates  And the sponsors  And that's where she'll  You know  The retribution  Will be  And it's like  Oh here we go  Same old Al  That's what's disgusting  About Sharpton  I really do hope  Sharpton grabs his chest  And just collapses  Because that's why  He's a pig  Because it's  Nobody is telling him  He cannot voice  Any opinion he wants  There's no threat  Of backlash  It's like  Why would you want  To threaten her  With backlash 
[01:28:00]  As much as she's  A reprehensible  Unfuckable monster  With a bad wig  Why would you want  Why should she have  Backlash for saying that  The only backlash  Should be  Somebody else  Debating you  And making you  Sound silly  For what you're saying  Not a backlash  Of losing your  Fucking livelihood  That like I said  Before is mob tactics  It's sickening  Right  Yeah  That's all I got  To else  Alright let's not  Argue sir  The more I think  About it  Dr. Laura  Has something else  Going on  By the end of the year  Hopefully it rhymes  With fades  Or mancer 
[01:28:30]  Or fucking  Mimidia  Fucking menopause  I hope she sneezed  And her uterus  Wind up under the console  That's why she cancelled  The other hour  Of her show  I have to have  A hysterectomy  Hope she's using  Her pussy to store  Winter coats  And I fucking  Hate that bitch  Who do I want  To fuck her  I think she wants  I think she wants  A lot of money  Over her freedom  Of speech  You know what I mean  You just don't  Walk away from  8 million  Fucking listeners  Unless you got 
[01:29:00]  Something else  In your head  That you're  Going on to  True  Fontaine  In Virginia  Hey boy  What's up Fontaine  What up  Hey Opie  You're an incredibly  Fair guy  And honest  And I appreciate  You taking this call  I respect that  About you  You guys got me  Mad this morning  Because you failed  To realize  That it takes  Time to prepare  I mean even  Even though  It's a month  Away  Jimmy's going  To be at  Charlie Goodnight  In Raleigh  September 30th  Through October 2nd  Tickets are on sale  Now  919-828-5233

[01:30:00]  And this is a great way  To jump off  And start anew  Morton Downey Jr.  Is actually  Rich Voss' dad  I didn't know that  I didn't know that  Until just now  Sure he did the swastika  Wrong  Of course he is  He's a dope  What did he call  A swastika  Voss  Voss  Yeah  He did  Check the wall  Check the wall  It might be up there  A Jew that can't say swastika  I hope it's up there  What a terrible person  Voss is  It's hard to find it though  There's hundreds  I know  There's so many  Vosses 
[01:30:30]  He's just a lump  Of shit  Wow  Manning's  Undergoing more tests  Uncertain for game  Huh  Oh yeah  Exactly what I said  Was going to happen  Someone's going to get  Man  Hurt because  Because they had to have  Bragging rights  It's just a new stadium  Dopes  Who won by the way  The NFL is  They're just stupid  I think it was a swash sticker  Swash  Swash  A swash sticker  The swash sticker  He's legally retarded  Don't do drugs kids 
[01:31:00]  That's the message here  He's a dope  Did maybe a little too much  Fucking drugs back in his day  He is a dope  Hey uh  Brett Favre  Brett Favre  Brett Favre  Brett Favre  This is why I love Florentine  I hope I'm not supposed to  Should I not be saying  Kenny  Should I  Should I not be saying  Where Jim is  I'll wait till tomorrow  Okay  What  Let's just say  No I can't  Out of respect  It's not a bad place  Florentine's having just  Let's say a really 
[01:31:30]  Cool moment  But all he's doing  Is trashing Brett Favre  On his Twitter  Really  No one hates Favre  More than Florentine  He's bashing him  He just attacks  I'm so sick of ESPN  Love affair with Brett Favre  He could shoot up  In elementary school  And they would still  Break down how precise  His aim is  He fucking  Instead of sending  A pic of his cock  To the girl  Favre should have sent  One of him  Throwing a big interception  That has ended  His last three seasons  It's uh  Jim Florentine  On Twitter  What is it  Mr. Jim Florentine 
[01:32:00]  He fucking murders  Brett Favre  I follow Jim  On Twitter  What  Kenny  Will he be in Hartford  Yeah he'll be in Hartford  Connecticut this weekend  Oh good  Yeah he's been  Killing Favre  Let's get him in  Well we should try  To get him on the phone  To talk about Brett Favre  So what Brett  What is he playing  This year I guess  Yeah he's uh  Just wants attention  He's playing  It's weird  Why does he need  So much attention  That's  Brett Favre  Embarrassing  He's pushing a little  Too much  Isn't he  Yeah I'm gonna retire 
[01:32:30]  He ain't going anywhere  Motherfucker  He ain't retiring  That's all we got  On that I guess  That's all we got  On Brett Favre  Wow  Yeah he's uh  He's playing  Boy how many times  This guy fucking  Fake retiring  Exactly enough  With him and his  Bad ankle  Go fuck yourself  Has he won a Superbowl  He won one right  No  Yeah he won  With Green Bay  Earlier in his career  Go pack go  So he's set  Go pack go 
[01:33:00]  You just need to  Win one in football  That's all you need  That's all you need  If you don't win any  You look silly  Uh  Ronnie B must be  Happy today  Oh  Judge rules in favor  Of Westboro Baptist Church  Oh right  Yeah  I know  We all know  Ronnie B's in bed  With those people  Says the Missouri's  The Missouri ban  I guess it should read  On protesting  At military funerals  Is unconstitutional  And they're right  As much as  They're a horrible  It hurts to say it  But they are right 
[01:33:30]  But there should be  Consequences  I'm waiting for the  Consequences  You'd hope  It's like that whole  N-word uh  Argument we have  You know I mean  If you want to say  The N-word in front  Of black people  There's going to be  Consequences  It really is a  Sickening thing  So if you want to  Like protest at  Military fucking  Funerals  I'm waiting for  Some consequences  And you know  What's going to  Happen  Someone's going  Someone's going  To do something  They're going  To lose their  Fucking mind  You hope  Yeah  Because it's  It's sickening  What they're doing  They have the  Right to do it  But I'm just 
[01:34:00]  Waiting for the  Other side of this  They're despicable  The consequences  Of doing something  Like that  They're just  Despicable people  I think that  Goes directly  That's  Contradictory  To what I was  Just saying  Before though  What  To say like  Okay  You say something  You do have  Freedom of speech  And then to say  That you're going  To do something  Where people  You hope people  Lose their job  Based on  Affiliates and  Sponsors  And now you're  Saying you hope  Somebody actually 
[01:34:30]  Might lose their  Life based on  What people are  Doing  We're hypocrites  No we're not  We didn't say that  This whole world  Is confusing  Well when you  Say you hope  Somebody does  Something  Whether it's  Physical violence  Just hope something  Happens  Whatever it is  Yeah yeah  But isn't that  Kind of contradictory  To what we're  Saying  No  Because I'm  Because expressing  Opinions  There's a  Common sense line  That we all have  And I'm not  Saying your  Opinions shouldn't  Be controversial  When you're 
[01:35:00]  Going to the  Funeral  Of dead  Soldiers  And you're  Saying  God likes  Dead soldiers  And you're  Showing these  Outlines of  Guys  Fucking guys  In the ass  You're being  Such egregious  Pigs  That even though  Technically you do  Have the freedom  I can still wish  Something horrible  Would happen to you  Even though I'm  Probably wrong to  Wish that  But wouldn't  That also be  If somebody  Is so offended  By what we're  Saying  That  Them what I was 
[01:35:30]  Saying about them  Going to sponsors  And using strong  Arm tactics  And things like  That  Isn't that  Kind of the same  Thing  No  This is a  Little more  Honest and  Strong arm  Tactics to  Advertisers  This is kind of  Just taking it  Right to the  Problem  This is taking  It right to  The  This is the  Equivalent  Of the audience  Tuning out  See here's why  If Dr.  Laura ever lost  Her show  It should be  Because people  Grew tired  Of hearing what  She said  And they no  Longer listened  There's a hundred  Or two hundred  Or three hundred  People in the  Westboro church  So I think 
[01:36:00]  That if  People grow  Tired of  Hearing what  They say  The audience  Leaving  Well maybe  That's the  Equivalent of  What I would  Like to  Happen  Freedom  I'm in an  Unwinnable  Argument  I know  That  Yeah  I'm allowing  My hatred  Of them  I know  It just feels  Right  We are  Hypocrites  Because it  Just feels  Right  Freedom in  America is  A very  Confusing  They're being  Reprehensible  Extremely  Confusing  That's like  Protesting  Outside of  A black  Funeral  And saying  Niggers  Are not as  Good as  White people  And then 
[01:36:30]  Saying  I have  Freedom of  Speech  What you're  Doing is  You're not  Really trying  To express  Freedom of  Speech  You're  Simply  Inciting  Inciting  Something  And you're  Trying to  Get attention  For yourself  Again  Maybe that  Should be  Legal  Oh  You're  Fighting  Your  Way  Out  Of  This  Jimmy  I like  This  But we  All know  What you're  Doing  Right  And again  Technically I could  Never win this  Argument in court  But when radio  Guys fuck up  They're not trying  To incite  In general  Um  Imus wasn't  Trying to  Incite  Anything  We keep  Going back  To Imus  He was just 
[01:37:00]  Trying to  Entertain his  Audience  And be  Funny  That's it  And what  They're doing  Is certainly  Inciting  Like  And it's  Almost like  If you're  A radio  Host  I would  It would be  Hard to  Defend a  Radio host  Even though he  Didn't break  Any FCC  Violations  Who went on  And said  You know  What  I think  The gas  Chambers  Were good  And I  Would never  Encourage  Anybody  To kill  Jews  But I  Think the  Fact that  They were  Slaughtered  Is a  Good  Thing  Because they  Contribute  And a  Guy  Didn't  Violate  He didn't  Incite  People to  Hurt  Jews  But I  Would  Still  Understand  A company  Firing  That guy 
[01:37:30]  Because using  Your freedom  Of speech  I guess  It should  Be legal  But he's  Being  A pig  I can't  Win  Can you  Use the  Fire  In a  Movie  Theater  No  Because I  Can't  Even say  That they're  Doing that  Westboro  Church is  Not causing  People to  Riot  They're not  Encouraging  People to  Riot  They're not  Putting people  In danger  I can't  Even say  That they  Are  They're not  They're just  Expressing  Horrendous  Opinions  Do you  Think you  Can incite  Somebody  To  Violence 
[01:38:00]  Through  Mental  Abuse  Like that  That is  A  If you're  A parent  Yeah  At the  Funeral  Of your  Child  That's  Been  Killed  In  The  War  And  You  See  These  People  With  Signs  Like  That  Don't  You  Think  That  Can  Be  Worse  Than  Yelling  Fire  In  A  Movie  Theater  Yes  But  The  Right  Of  Americans  To  Protest  The  War  In a  Public  Place  Overrides  The  Rights  Of  Parents  However  Real 
[01:38:30]  Their  Feelings  Are  To  Not  Be  Hurt  And  Believe  Me  Playing  Devil's  Advocate  Because  I  Think  They're  Repugnant  But  The  Right  To  Say  What  You  Want  Publicly  Overrides  The  Right  Of  People's  Feelings  I  Think  So  Yeah  Because  They  Are  Making  A  Public  And  Again  I  Think  They're  Despicable  I  Really  I  Can't  Think  Of  A  More  Hateable  Oh  I  Know  Egregious  And  So  Piggish  But  I  Guess  The  Constitution 
[01:39:00]  Does  Allow  For  It  And  A  Lot  Of  People  Would  Find  Say  A  Gay  Protest  Across  The  Street  I  Know  I'm  Killing  My  Argument  But  A  Gay  Protest  Across  The  Street  Of  A  Church  During  A  Service  Right  We  Want  To  Just  As  Disgusting  As  That  Right  And  They  Have  The  Right  To  Do  That  As  An  American  How  Much  Freedom  Are  That  Klan  Has  The  Right  To  March  But  I'm  Just  Saying  That's  A  Question  That  I  Think  People 
[01:39:30]  Think  About  All  The  Time  How  Much  Freedom  Are  They  Willing  To  Accept  In  America  Right  That's  A  Lot  Of  People  If  We  Went  To  The  Phones  Want  This  Want  These  People  Shut  Down  Yeah  Unless  They  There  Has  To  Be  A  Way  Because  They  All  They're  Lawyers  They're  Smart  Shirley  Phelps  Smart  Woman  They  All  Know  Their  Rights  So  The  Cops  Will  Go  I  Just  Want  To  Say  One  Thing  We  Don't  Want  To  Hear  It  Yep  Can  I  Just  Say  No  You  Can't  They 
[01:40:00]  They  Don't  Care  What  The  Cops  Say  Because  They  Are  Within  Their  Rights  And  They  Know  It  The  Best  Thing  To  Do  To  Them  Was  When  That  Motorcycle  Gang  Blasted  The  Motorcycles  Right  Where  They  Were  Protesting  Like  To  Say  Yes  The  Public  Right  To  Fight  Back  That  Way  Yep  Because  You  Got  That  Freedom  Yep  Fred  In  Florida  Hello  Hi  Fred  Hi

[01:42:00]  It's  Called  But  It's  About  The  Westboro  It  Was  Such  A  Long  Title  I  Was  Who  Would  Buy  This  But  I  And  They're  Looking  For  Attention  And  They  Found  The  Fag  Issue  And  It's  Like  What's  The  Matter  Was  Nobody  Noticing  You  Before  No  One  Was  Noticing  Their  Little  Church  This  Was  Funny  This  Guy  Was  Great  Oh  Who's  This  Oh  I  Don't  Know  If  This  Is  The  Guy  The  Guy  Who  Rickrolled

[01:43:00]  Nom  Look at  her  I  Love  Vagina  Sign  I  Think  If  People  Are  Going  To  Attack  Shirley  Phelps  Roper  Phelps  Or  Whatever  It  Is  What  They  Should  Do  Is  They  Should  Hold  Up  Pictures  Because  One  Of  Her  Kids  I  Believe  She  Had  Out  Of  Wedlock  They  Should  Attack  Her  With  That  Because  That  Is  A  Source  Of  Humiliation  And  They  Should  Show  Up  To  Hold  Up  Pictures  Of  Him  And  Hold  Up  Signs  Asking  Her  What  The  Cock  Felt  Like  How  Did  It  Feel  To  Take  A  Cock  When  You  Weren't  Married  And  Ask 
[01:43:30]  Fred  How  Does  Know  To  Know  That  Your  Da  Lay  Down  And  Wrapped  Her  Legs  Around  Somebody  Out  Of  Wedlock  Oh  That  Should  Be  Fuming  Like  How  Did  That  Feel  Did  He  Put  It  Deeper  Than  Most  Men  Do  I  Mean  Like  That's  To  Me  What  I  Would  Do  Yeah  Yep  They're  Hard  To  Argue  With  Though  Because  I  Think  They're  They're  You  Know  They're  Very  Convicted  In  Their  Beliefs  This  Is  A  Very  Good  Point  From  Dan  Dan  Go  Go ahead  Dan  Dan  Hey guys  How you  Doing  I'm  A  Father  Of  Two  I'm 
[01:44:00]  Just  Saying  It's  Inevitable  Two  Beautiful  Children  I  Can  Honestly  Say  My  Life  Would  Be  Over  If  I  Ever  Lost  My  Kids  I  Would  Have  No  Qualms  About  Going  Into  A  Situation  Where  I  Bomb  I  Mean  I  Don't  Say  You're  Going  A  Certain  Place  Unless  Your  Rich Vossen  You're  On  Your  Way  There  To  Do  A  Game  Sorry  Rich  Let  Let  Let  Let  Help  You  Along 
[01:44:30]  Being  Being  A  Father  You're  Saying  If  You  Lost  One  Of  Your  Kids  You  Have  Pretty  Much  Nothing  To  Lose  Absolutely  And  If  You  Felt  Like  Someone  Was  Mocking  The  Death  Of  Your  Son  Or  Daughter  That  Would  It  Would  Be  Pretty  Easy  To  Maybe  Think  About  Doing  Something  Well  We  Always  Think  About  That  Guy  That  Spun  Around  At  The  Phone  Booth  When  They  Were  Bringing  That  Defendant  Out  That  Had  That  That's  A  Perfect  Example  Of  A  Father  That  Had  Nothing  To  Lose  Blew  The  Guy's  Brains  Out  Put  The  Gun  Down  Put  His  Hands  Up  Right  That  Was  It  Why 
[01:45:00]  I find  That  Church  To  Be  So  Despicable  Is  Because  They're  Going  This  And  Again  I  This  Is  What  I  Think  Their  Argument  Is  I'm  Not  100%  Sure  Was  That  The  IEDs  They  Say  IEDs  Are  Good  Because  They  Kill  Soldiers  Is  Apparently  Some  IEDs  Or  Some  Explosive  Devices  Were  Thrown  Onto  Their  Property  Years  Ago  And  The  Legal  System  Didn't  Do  Much  About  It  Probably  Because  Everybody  Hates  Them  So  They  Feel  And  Again  I  Think  This  Is  The  Argument  That  God 
[01:45:30]  Is  Defending  These  Soldiers  Meaning  Them  The  Soldiers  Of  Faith  By  Allowing  This  Country  To  Be  Punished  By  IEDs  Overseas  Like  God  Is  Punishing  America  For  Allowing  These  Good  Children  Of  God  To  Be  Harassed  Or  Injured  Or  Threatened  But  By  That  Logic  If  You  Have  Such  Faith  In  God  Why  Do  You  Need  The  Police  To  Protect  You  Why  Do  You  Need  To  Follow  Civil  Ordinance  You  Fucking  Cowards  That 
[01:46:00]  To  Kill  Soldiers  Overseas  Why  Wouldn't  God  Stop  Some  Local  Yoko  Cops  From  Interfering  Why  Do  You  Need  Protection  Why  Do  You  Need  To  File  For  Permits  Just  March  That  To  Me  Is  Where  The  Coward  Is  Because  It's  God's  Will  If  God's  Will  Is  That  Someone  Puts  A bullet  Through  One  Of  Their  Heads  Then  It's  Just  God's  Will  And  Boy  Would  They  Be  In  For  Surprise  After 
[01:46:30]  Wrong  I  Have  A  Lot  Of  Things  To  Apologize  For  Let's  Go  To  Don  In  Texas  Don  Yeah  I'm  Here  We  Had  A  Local  Soldier  That  Passed  Away  Over  There  In  Overseas  And  Westbury  Baptist  Church  Had  Tried  To  Come  In  Or  Did  I  Say  Right  Anyway  They  Shut  Them  Down  The  Thing  Is  Our  City  It's  A  Real  Small  Town  And  Everything  Else 
[01:47:00]  Couple  Thousand  People  They  Shut  The  Entire  Town  Down  For  This  Guy's  Funeral  You  Couldn't  Drive  They  Had  The  Fire  Department  You  Know  How  It  Is  Texas  The  Thing  Is  These  People  Are  Cowards  They  Won't  Come  To  An  Area  That  Have  A  Lot  Of  Support  For  The  Soldiers  Or  Anything  Else  Plus  In  Texas  We  Can  Carry  Guns  So  You  Know  And  They  Also  Again  I  Would  I  Would  Have  More  Respect  For  Them  At  Maybe  They  Do  But  The  Gay  Pride  Parade  Here  In  New  York  Why  Don't  They  Show  Up  There  God  Loves  Dead  Fag 
[01:47:30]  How  About  All  40  Or  50  Of  You  Show  Up  With  Your  Signs  And  Again  Watch  The  Police  Try  To  Stop  You  From  Being  Attacked  Thousands  Of  Homos  Come  After  You  I  Wonder  If  They're  Denied  Permits  Because  The  Police  Couldn't  Protect  them  Probably  They  Probably  Would  Be  Overrun  And  Unfortunately  Cops  Would  Get  Hurt  Comic  Con  Is  Coming  Up  A  Lot  Oh  Yeah  They  Were  Outside  Me  And  Sam  Drove  By  Them  Why  Were  They  There  Because  They  Need  Attention  And  That's  Where  They  You  Go  After  The  Comic  Books

[02:34:00]  we gotta  go to  sentry  gun  three  i saw  schematics  for that  where you  could actually  build a  sentry  paintball  gun  where if  someone  gets too  close  to your  shit  really  and follow  you  it'll  unload  paintballs  on you  that's  fucking  cool  as shit  that would  be cool  on a paintball  field  i'm just  stalling  i want to  hear the  auto line  now and i want  to hear the jay  line yeah i'm  looking for jay  more comedy  central i asked jay  what the line was  because i know  auto for 20  years and there  are certain  things that  get said  like calling  shit yoo-hoo  yeah that is 
[02:34:30]  something that  you'd say in  third grade but  to say like the  yoo-hoo is  rocketing  is uh  in auto  isn't  you know  that's uh  that's a  thing between  comics  sure  i i i  i don't  know  no  rocketing  i guess it  depends on how  you say it  phraseology  it's like  yeah i guess it  depends on how  you say it  you could say  you who looks  like shit  uh  yeah  but if you  say rocketing 
[02:35:00]  and it's  try to think  of a dice  example  where uh  you would  know  you know  the terminology  yeah  you know  i hear ya  i hear ya  oh my god  oh here's auto  okay  auto  yes  hey buddy  we weren't uh  just so you know  we weren't we  weren't uh  we didn't we  didn't uh  set you up  sabotage you at all  i'm not that  sensitive  i've been  fucking performing  for over 35  years  you think i got  a thin skin  that's true  no  yeah but we

[02:36:00]  so i watched  it and it  was it was  it was my  it was definitely  my phraseology  but i think he  actually uh  might have been  innocent in that  case and thought  that it was  it was  because he left  some  some long  message where  he said  it was  it was not  meant to happen  and it was  it was uh  it was uh  an expression  that he  that he had  thought he  had heard  was part of  popular culture  whatever  i don't know  well we got  we got it  uh here's jay  more doing  uh  the line  oh wow  i just lost

[02:42:00]  and uh  she really does have lovely hips  quite a dish  to put your cum in  why is she among pictures of jackie gleason though  what's the  what's the  maybe because her knockers were bouncing all over the joint  yeah no  i put into google whip them out wednesday pics  so there's some weird show shit popping up  oh okay  because jackie gleason pops up  her ass was wiggling too  and then the wow sticker on the old lady's wheelchair is pretty classic 
[02:42:30]  yeah that's nice  i've never seen that one before  that's good  she has no clue that's there  none  whatsoever  her puffy white old lady hair  exactly  can't wait till they find her  fucking on the floor with a hummel broken next to her head  and one askew shoe  one little white shoe off to the side  her fucking white anklet sock  why does it always have to end so badly  i know  why  that's it  all right what else is going on  we only have a few minutes before montana calls in so  montana 
[02:43:00]  uh you know this mosque thing  now yesterday uh we were reading a story  and andy levy i think is the one saying it's not true  that that they're not moving this mosque  uh jimmy we discussed that at the beginning of the show yesterday  no the gentleman that um the gentleman the developer  says uh they're not moving  now patterson the governor here  our um esteemed mr magoo governor  is uh trying to get the two parties together  the developer  and uh some of the 9-11 survivors  uh the loved ones and whatnot 
[02:43:30]  and try to get some kind of compromise  but the developer is saying there's no way they're moving  oh okay well then fuck them  fuck them it's what you expect  is the developer  that's not the uh the site  i have no idea if they're the arabs  or if they are the um people that own the property  that are selling it  which i don't know  they're also  well i would sell it too  but  developer  the owner of the building  who is working with  a mom  yeah the owner of the building  developed a scumbag  uh  and he's saying that it's at a great distance 
[02:44:00]  from ground zero  and if you look at the little map  that's two blocks  that the paper uh  has  yeah it's about this way  two two and a half blocks  it's a fucking  part of the building  or plane fell on it  it's close enough  two blocks from the edge  yeah  of ground zero  if if debris  and part of the plane  landed on the building  i'd say it's in the ballpark  yeah that's not  it's pretty close  that's not a great distance  the entire area was fucked  i don't think you could have like a fucking uh 
[02:44:30]  oppenheimer museum  at hiroshima  you know  i don't think they'd appreciate that  well it's out of the blast radius  kind of  yeah  i don't think they would like that  yeah no  so to say it's at a great distance  is ridiculous  because that whole area  was affected  the building owner  probably just wants to get  a lease in  or selling it  because he probably can't sell  maybe no one's buying down there  right now  i don't know  oh  because i know that's why  they didn't rebuild the towers  they would have rebuilt the towers  at the actual height  or whatever  but you'd never be able to rent  the top floors 
[02:45:00]  who would rent  that's a cop out  i absolutely think they  they didn't build it  for other reasons  whether they would have been able  to rent it out or not  is you know  who knows  but i don't think that's  the real reason  no business would have put  their workforce  up there again  because  the whole fucking company  is wiped out  like no business  would have said  that there are  150 of our people  are on the fucking  101st floor  no one  because people wouldn't  go to work  because it's a target  they've knocked  these buildings down 
[02:45:30]  they are going to come  after them again  they've tried twice  because they bombed  in 93  and then 9-11  so you don't think  the freedom tower  is going to be a target  well the freedom tower  the top of it  is a fucking  yeah i know  it's like a big  fucking  a spy ride  facade  what is it  like a 60 story  building  but it's 60 stories  so if you hit  at the 40th floor  there's still  20 floors  of fucking  40 50 60  there's still 20 floors  of fucking  no no but you're right  tragedy  but it's not  the target  that the towers were  it's just not 
[02:46:00]  the target  the freedom tower  what a terrible name  that is a dumb name  i would love them  to rebuild it  would i live on the top floor  i don't know  i can't say i would  unless they gave me  a parachute  then maybe  you wouldn't live  on the top floor  it'd be hard man  yeah we  we work pretty high up  and you know  makes you think  i want this stupid  building  i'm going for this  but i know  i understand that  but it makes you  a little nervous  imagine uh  being down there  what makes me nervous  stories up  don't get nervous  it's  we should have  something built  by now though 
[02:46:30]  it's sickening  it's ridiculous  i'm amazed  that the actual  the building  of the towers  we're almost  up to the point  where  enough time  has passed by  where they  actually built  the towers  years ago  yeah  in the same amount  they built things  a lot slower  yeah  now they  these buildings  go up in  within two years  yeah  maybe a little  less  i heard uh  you know  john stewart  i just  he's uh  just a tad  too liberal  for me  uh  i was watching  the daily show 
[02:47:00]  and he was talking  about the mosque  thing  and uh  he had some  republicans  um  some tape  of some republicans  bashing the president  for saying what he  said about  muslim religion  and how they have  the right  and blah  blah  you've all heard  what obama said  but uh  he was mocking  the republicans  a politician  and kind of  saying like  well they  they do have a  right to be down  there  which they do  but it's  it's more of an  emotional thing  and a  ideological thing  and all i'm 
[02:47:30]  thinking is  this motherfucker  is the same  baby that was  crying on his  show  after september  11th  about what  happened  down there  and and the  towers  and and really  like stepped  out of his  john stewart  daily show  character  was open  and honest  about how  tragic it  was  the death  of the people  and how he  felt  and then you  watch him  doing this  and and  supporting a  mosque going  there  and as a  self-hating  jew he ought to  be ashamed of  himself  but uh 
[02:48:00]  the fact that  he was backing  this  i'm just sitting  there going like  you fucking  forget that you  were crying on  the daily show  about how the  towers are gone  but now at least  you can from  your apartment  instead of seeing  the towers you  can see  the statue  of liberty  and it was  like so that  was his line  that was his  line it was  like fuck  you man  you forgot  already you  cocksucker just  like everybody  else so you go  in a time  machine he's not  talking about the  mosque uh  favorably uh  right no i don't 
[02:48:30]  think he would have  been speaking about  the mosque favorably  time goes by though  and you change it  everyone forgets  i didn't forget  i didn't forget  yes you did  i never forget  you forgot  what  what  i forgot  we're abbott and  costello all of a  sudden  coclogic wants to  know  coclogic wants to  know if we're  having any more  phone calls today  maybe stephen lynch  calling out mario  canton  oh shit  uh well we got  jesse ventura  uh checking in 
[02:49:00]  anthony so we'll  get to the i want  to hear the john  stewart thing now  yeah yeah yeah  someone get that  immediately uh  jesse ventura  orders around  uh hello  i know why  they're not  building the  freedom tower  the government  is still trying  to make enough  thermite paint  to paint the  interior of the  building  i know  yeah fucking  dude your  phone's cutting  out what  yeah what'd  you say dude  fuck that  fuck it out  yeah pretty sure 
[02:49:30]  i know  oh boy  that call  stunk  it really  did  so the mosque  is gonna go  up  yeah it looks  like that  i bet that  mosque has a lot  of problems  it goes back to  how much freedom  are you willing to  accept in america  that's it  yep  how much are you  willing to accept  that's despicable  it's kind of what  you expected though  out of uh  out of that group  why would they  give a fuck about 
[02:50:00]  9-11 victims  when you know  you looked at the  way saudi arabia  handed a 10  million dollar check  over and they  tell us to examine  their foreign policy  and good for  rudy didn't  accept it  yeah so there's  always an asterisk  by any time  islamic groups  or muslims have  said anything  bad about 9-11  or sad about  9-11 there's  been an asterisk  which was well  you know foreign  policy you should  examine there's  always the  underlying thing  of we brought  it on ourselves  yeah always  and what is  patterson uh  doing about  what's he doing 
[02:50:30]  he's reading  curtains  he's banging  his shins  again  on an end  table  he wants to  uh get together  with the uh  developers and  the the survivors  and families of  9-11 victims  and uh kind of  reach some kind  of compromise  yes but he's in  brooklyn and he  doesn't understand  that that's not  where ground zero  is he thinks  he thinks he's  at coke zero  he's reading the  bottle is this  from 9-11  it's a coke zero  you blind idiot  how much more  time does he  have in office  uh a couple 
[02:51:00]  months right  he doesn't know  uh let's say  hi to montana  fishburn on our  phone lines  welcome to the  opian anthony  show montana  hi guys  hi how are you  oh you got the  sexy voice too  oh yeah  that's gonna that's  gonna work nicely  in your favor  i'm gonna look at  the box cover here  um from your  video  now anthony was  confused he thought  you had implants  and i'm saying  this this montana  fishburn those  are some nice  young bosom  she has  yeah natural baby  those are natural  huh  yes big and heavy  wow yeah they  look uh wow 
[02:51:30]  you really are  well endowed  thank you  i was watching  your video  and you squirt  yeah i do  my yeah they  call me squirtle  so how did you  learn you could  squirt because a  lot of people  think that's pee  oh no um i learned  i could squirt i mean  um having sex one  time yeah like it  just happened and  it was like whoa  you were freaking  were you freaking  out yeah like kind  of i was like wow 
[02:52:00]  like i didn't know  like he was like did  you know you could  squirt and i was  like no what are you  talking about and i  was like hmm and  then it became my new  thing so you this movie  came about like a lot  of people like well  she's larry fishburne's  daughter and your dad's  very famous and could  probably help you get  other acting work what  like did you what how  did this come about  because that's the  question a lot of  people have  um i got interested in  porn like when i was  16 oh damn like after 
[02:52:30]  i lost my virginity i  got you know interested  in sex and exploring you  know different kinds of  stuff um 18 i recorded  myself on camera and  like i was like wow  this is great and i've  been thinking about doing  porn since i was 16 so i  was like well now i'm 18 i  can do it and i got it  done did you do any  other kind of acting  work like any mainstream  stuff no like music 
[02:53:00]  videos but um i was more  interested in the adult  right now now you  actually enjoy uh everything  you're doing on film like  you and you enjoy having  the sex yeah definitely i  mean i wouldn't do it if  i didn't know she hates  it she absolutely hates  it i don't know at some  point starts in the movie  you can tell she likes  give her a few years and  then ask that question  yeah yeah hey uh the  paper's reporting today  that your your dad's mad  because you're using you  know uh your real last  name and he's basically  making a point that most 
[02:53:30]  porn stars they don't use  their real names you want  you want to comment about  that because that's all  over our papers uh this  morning i mean i look at  it as if i were to go into  the mainstream if i used a  fake name it would have  been brought up later like  okay well she did porn but  also you know pamela  anderson and kendra  wilkinson and you know all 
[02:54:00]  these people have sex  tapes using their real name  so i don't see it as a  problem and i'm not ashamed  of it and i'm not ashamed  of who i am so i don't find  a need to hide behind a  fake name did you did you  grow up with your dad or  did you grow up um just  with his name but living  with someone else um i  lived primarily with my mom  but i was with my dad like  a lot too so i mean so  you guys had a pretty good  relationship until uh until  now yeah we had a good  relationship yeah until how 
[02:54:30]  did you tell him that you  were going to do it because  you know you're 18 you're  allowed to do what you want  but how did how did he find  out how did you let him  know um he found out like  everyone else did pretty  much um i kept my you know i  kept this thing with vivid  the secret until it was  going to be released  because um i don't know  it was just something i  kept to myself i was  really um you know when i  was younger when i thought  about doing it when i was  16 i couldn't really tell  people okay i want to be a  porn star because they look  at me like okay you're only 
[02:55:00]  16 you can't do that right  so i kept it a secret until  it came out and he's tried  obviously to get you to not  do it and you just have kind  of been headstrong and said  you definitely want to do it  and this is what you want  um well like i said he  didn't really have the  opportunity to try and  stop me because i i did it  with you know on my own  is this like we all go  through teenage rebellions  and i'm not saying you  don't want to do porn but  is this kind of like just a  rebellious thing like you're  not going to be under his  shadow you're not going to 
[02:55:30]  live with what he wants you  to live with that you just  you know no i definitely  don't think so i mean this  has been a conscious decision  for a long time so it's not  about rebelling or anything  it's just something that i  am passionate about and  something that i want to  pursue right okay uh you  you're hoping this leads to  other like mainstream type of  things because you mentioned  kim kardashian and how she got  really famous after her sex  tape um i do hope it leads to  mainstream work but like i said 
[02:56:00]  uh adult is the world that i was  most interested in and the uh  industry i wanted to step my foot  into first um but the parallel  with kim is that she released a  sex tape and it didn't stop her  from going uh mainstream and  becoming successful and being  positive in a lot of different  ways is there a little part of  you though that is wants to  because we all want mainstream  success i think any entertainer  any adult entertainer would tell  you that too if you look at ron  jeremy or any of the ones that 
[02:56:30]  have kind of crossed over here and  there in smaller roles is this a  way of kind of getting into  mainstream without asking your  dad for help like in a way of  doing it on your own without  relying on him like a lot of  other people would with famous  parents um yes and no but i think  if i wanted to dive into  mainstream first if i didn't want  to use his help i would have you  know found another way to dive into  mainstream by you know going the  traditional route this is it is a 
[02:57:00]  way because it puts me into the  you know entertainment world but  it's not the you know the main  reason well it separates you because  people now are talking about you  they know who you are so it  actually does give you a more  recognizable name not just people  be like oh this is lawrence  fishburn's daughter but people be  like yeah we know who montana  fishburn is so it does actually put  you a lot more in the limelight than  starting traditionally would have  yeah it definitely does and how 
[02:57:30]  many so you're with vivid do you  have a contract with them like a  long-term deal i don't um you know  there's been reports uh of them  offering me a multi-movie deal but i  haven't accepted um you know anything  as of yet and i haven't started  working on a new project but just you  know just talking about different  things with different people if you  went into mainstream let's just say  that happened eventually i'm sure it  will if you wanted to what type of  stuff might you be interested in  mainstream i'm sure you've looked at 
[02:58:00]  stuff um i'm definitely interested in  modeling music and some acting more  reality but um yeah are you i'm sorry  god no what were you saying you don't  i mean again i i to us you know your  dad is this this iconic actor but to you  he's just your father just like my dad  is to me and sometimes it gets  annoying when your parents want you to  do certain things that you don't want  to do so you're like ah fuck them do you 
[02:58:30]  do you feel bad that he's obviously  very embarrassed by this or hurt by this  um no i definitely feel bad that he's  embarrassed by it but um at the same  time i don't feel like he should you  know i understand why he's embarrassed  but at the same time i don't feel like  he should be because he knows that he  was a good parent and he knows he has a  you know a father with a good head on  his shoulders and so he should you know  not i mean i like he can be embarrassed 
[02:59:00]  but not don't be ashamed and and and not be  proud of me but at least support that he  knows that i'm gonna make good decisions  even if he doesn't feel it's the right  one when was the last time you talked to  um a couple days ago oh okay so you guys  are still talking  because because it was reported in the  paper today that he's not going to talk  to you or speak to you until you turn your  life around that's i mean that's the last  conversation i had with him  okay so it's the okay and that happened 
[02:59:30]  two days ago  there were allegations too and i don't even  know where i heard this of uh was it a  prostitution arrest or i mean look and  sometimes performers do what they call  privates  which is kind of like you know you know  you know what it is um what about those  no i have never been a prostitute  okay i didn't know if i heard you were  arrested or if you're done i thought i  heard you had been arrested for it yeah  it was reported it was reported again  but that doesn't make it a fact yeah 
[03:00:00]  there you go any uh i always love  asking adult uh film actresses this one  anything you wouldn't do in a movie  right yeah definitely um i no i'm not  into gang bangs  i mean i don't what else how about anal i  did did you did you have an anal  yeah all right do you like it or you  that's a trooper do you like it or you  would do it  i mean i would do it all right it's kind  of like lima beans like you're not going 
[03:00:30]  to enjoy them but you'll do them to get  away from the table wow that's a squirt  yeah you're squirting all over the lens  in your film i didn't say i don't enjoy  it but you might see it  in another film you do but i don't know  what was the money for this good like  because it's out there forever now did  you feel like the money was worth it  yeah definitely what does your mom think  um she she's conservative so she's not  you know you know saying yay my daughter 
[03:01:00]  is a porn star but she just wants to  make sure that i'm okay with the decision  i made and that you know that i know  that she loves me and that she's there  for me if i need her for anything was  the guy you hooked up with your  boyfriend or was he just an adult actor  i can't speak on that oh um okay is is he  is he anonymous as to who he is yeah  and so you can't say the relationship  because by giving away the relationship  you might be giving away who he is yeah 
[03:01:30]  okay so he's obviously not an adult  actor does he not want to be known  i don't know i haven't talked to him  about it  wait oh okay hold on so now is this  something that you're releasing without  his consent but his face is not in it  no he i mean he definitely has the  consent i think we'd have a you know  some legal issues if he didn't have his  consent  it's not your brother right  oh jeez no he's a white guy  what are we looking at here that's a  white guy  he's a white guy yeah right he's a  white kid isn't he 
[03:02:00]  he might i don't know if he's white he  might just be light-skinned yeah he  looks light-skinned jimmy say i thought  he was a white guy well she said it's  maybe that's wishful thinking on my part  it looks a little uh  no he's a white guy his dick ain't that  big  he looks like a white guy  hey is there anybody that you'd like  to work with like who would you like  to fuck on film if you could  excuse me  who would you like to fuck on film if  you could  um 
[03:02:30]  i don't know i don't want to get in  trouble for saying anyone  why you won't get in trouble for  saying no guy's gonna get mad if you  admit that you want to fuck them  lexington steel  yeah lil wayne  i meant in the in the industry  oh i mean that's true oh but in the  porn industry yeah lil wayne's not  gonna fuck on film i don't think  you never know  yeah you're right that's true he  watches that video 
[03:03:00]  yes so is she contracted to vivid  she said there's rumors of it but no  oh so this could be one and done for  her  could be yeah this could be one and  done for you montana you want to make  more porns  i do i do i'm um  that's why i said you know i'm  getting  some different offers from people so  like i said vivid's offering me a  deal  and you know some other people are  interested in working with me  offering me contracts so  i do want to do more porn but i don't  know if i want to  sign onto a contract or be 
[03:03:30]  freelance or  if you want to do  if you want to get into the  mainstream  i'm sorry if you want to get into  the mainstream  the way to do it  is a one and done movie  because if you look at paris hilton  kardashian or any of them  they didn't do follow-ups because  once you cross over and you just  become  right  an adult actress  then the story of  laurence fishburne's daughter doing  it is over  and there's a lot of adult  actresses and it's very hard for  them to segue out  right once they're in deep  and and to add to your point uh 
[03:04:00]  like them you got to make believe  the tape was stolen  right  they all make believe the tape  was stolen  yeah oops  and then everyone feels sorry  for you but they have to take a  look obviously  yeah  see what see what your pussy  looks like and stuff  yeah everybody wants to see it  and then you move on and do  like a reality show  yeah  um  i'm not trying to  be like  a lot of  not a lot of them but  some porn stars do do a lot of  films and get banged out and  then lose interest  i'm not trying to do  that's why i said i'm getting a 
[03:04:30]  lot of different deals but i'm  not signing on to anything  because i'm still considering  all my options and what i want  to do and where i want to be  from here  yeah a one and done seems to  work  pam and tommy lee they did one  everyone it seems who just  it's almost like  pam and tommy is my favorite  shout out to pamela and  that is a good one  oh yeah  louisville slugger  paris is better though i like  paris's blowjobs better  uh this is a rumor i'm reading  are you doing a movie called the  mate pricks  i not that i know of 
[03:05:00]  all right just just seeing  that rumor was true  you know what that's a good  question though would you do  because they're going to offer  you movies  that are you know porn name  titles to one of your father  you know mocking your dad a  little bit  yeah or just using that  to gain more  how far would you go to hurt  him  i mean i'm not trying to hurt  him so you know people are  suggesting a lot of um  of his movie parodies but  what's a parody you heard that  was a terrible parody name or  one that was an interesting  parody name 
[03:05:30]  um  what was  mattress reloaded  oh yeah  reloaded  probably yeah  mattress  yeah  then it really seems like  you're  yeah  if you're doing that it  seems like there's a really  direct  well that looks like a  white guy  he's a white guy  yeah  is that the same guy that's  through the whole film  montana  in the film  yeah  one guy right 
[03:06:00]  one guy  i think you should be able  to tell  yeah it's hard  in the car it looked like a  light-skinned black guy  now this guy looks  obviously white  could be the lighting  he's white  no he's a white guy  you're on a table  it's very sexy  don't your knees hurt  well i'm used to um  you know i'm used to a lot  of different positions  i'm very high maintenance  in bed i could never have  my knees on a hard surface  really  no i wouldn't like that  at all  take the pain you faggot  yeah  come on  take it  so would you have  do you prefer white guys 
[03:06:30]  or black guys in bed  um  i don't really  i mean it depends on the  you know on the stroke  not  not on the  on the color  okay  ah there you go  hey what do your tattoos say  i meant to ask you  one under your breast  and one right over your  uh  over your uh  your pussy  what did they say  uh  the one on my breast  says well conquers all evil  okay  and uh  the one by my pussy  it's a crown  and it says  jeremy green  what's jeremy green  that's my boyfriend  oh that's your boyfriend 
[03:07:00]  you have your boyfriend's  name tattooed  over your vagina  wow he must be  fucking a great fuck  that's dedication  yeah  how are you gonna cover it up  if you guys  how are you gonna cover it up  if uh you break up  with hair  that might be a tough one  yeah just grow the hair in  go old school  get a big 70s earth mama muff  yeah  good point  and jeremy's not in this film  no  i don't know  i don't know  well this  he's my boyfriend  he's your boyfriend  jeremy's your boyfriend  for how long  you've been dating jeremy  two years 
[03:07:30]  two years  do you cheat on him  no  so he's primarily  your sexual partner  yeah  every day  okay so she's 19  she's been dating  this guy two years  she hasn't cheated on him  and she's having sex  it's within the last year  so this is probably  who the boyfriend is  yeah  so you're having sex  with your boyfriend  how come he doesn't  how come the person  doesn't want to be identified  i would love to be identified  um  i don't  i mean i don't know  to  i don't know  it's uh  it makes it more fun  that way  i think it helps out 
[03:08:00]  your dad a little bit  if he knows  you're just having sex  with your boyfriend  and now there's a tape  of it out there  yeah  i don't think  that helps the boyfriend  he probably doesn't  like the boyfriend  no i imagine  did the boyfriend  talk you into doing  oh you know  you said you kind of  wanted to when you were 16  yeah i wanted to do  when i was 16  when you were making this  i'm sorry to keep  peppering you with questions  did were you making this  for distribution  or is this one of the  just a home fuck movie  that you two made  no it was made  for distribution  okay  yeah 
[03:08:30]  yeah  definitely  yeah  well we're just uh  watching some of your work  here and  wow  at home tapes  are really raunchy  it's  oh you have home tapes  yeah  are those black uh  freckles around your pussy  i have spots on my butt  and all over my body  oh  i like to call myself  a leopard booty  okay  oh yeah  yeah  so i mean 
[03:09:00]  it's nothing weird  no  i just want to make sure  they're not open sores  or anything  no  it says  montana fishburn  it says an a-list daughter  makes her triple x debut  now why would they  if it's not about  just kind of  capitalizing off  the father  why would they put  an a-list daughter  because i mean  it does play into it  like you said  it is gonna help  it sell tapes  and  i mean  my movie is doing well  and i want it to 
[03:09:30]  continue to do well  i mean  it's only scary  but this is what i'm saying  we're like  you're saying that  you're kind of  just kind of  branching out  and doing your own  thing  but in a way  you are  you are kind of  grabbing the obvious  and using that  to help  sell tapes  doesn't that kind of  give your father  a reason to be angry  um  it gives him a reason  to be angry  but  i don't  i mean  he shouldn't be mad  about me being successful  i don't think she's ever  come out and said  oh i'm not 
[03:10:00]  you know  no no no  on my name  or anything either  no you're right  but you're right  a little bit  you might as well  yeah  got the name  you might as well  you know  use it  fuck it  you look a little  like him  but not enough  like like him  to not be hot  yeah  that makes it creepy  yeah it's like  you look a little  like your dad  but you're still  really fucking hot  yeah  yeah it's really funny  people will be like  you're a spitting image  of your father  but  i want to fuck you  so  it's weird  yeah  well we learned  something today  it's uh  you having sex 
[03:10:30]  with your boyfriend  uh  jeremy green  who i'm also  finding out  is a light-skinned  uh  black guy  get out of here  no  yeah  he could not be  that light-skinned  maybe that's not  our boyfriend  that having sex  with her  maybe it wasn't  counted as cheating  because it's a uh  you know  it's it's  it's professional's work  i don't know  she's not denying it  she shut right up  right there  whatever  yeah i don't really  mad at a maze  getting slammed  would you have sex  with lexington steel  on film  um  i don't know 
[03:11:00]  he'd have to make  me an offer  i can't refuse  okay  he's got a pretty  you don't care  that he's a giant  penis  i think at this point  she doesn't want to  cheat on her boyfriend  who she's having sex  with in this video  well  we don't know that  she knows  come on  we weren't bored  yesterday  it's okay  the tape will still  do very well  montana  oh my god  people are uh  by the way  the film features  her in a mall  having sex in a car  and then again  in a hotel room  it's really sexy  in the mall too 
[03:11:30]  because she's bending  over in the store  and he's like  just showing you  the ass from the  back of the short skirt  it's the opening  it's very hot  oh really  i like the car scene  the car scene is alright  oh yeah  what's your favorite  scene guys  i just told you  the car scene  for me  hard to say  probably the  i love the cum shot  when you  when you're  you take the facial  it's really really sexy  and i love when you're  squirting in the car  and i also love  the mall stuff  because it just shows  you're a real person  walking around  and it has a home  video quality  it's not overly produced  like a lot of porn is 
[03:12:00]  right  which kind of makes it  very fucking  relatable and sexy  what do you think  your uh  father's favorite  scene would be  oh p  i hope he didn't  watch it  i mean  i'm sure  i'm sure he watched  a little bit  you don't  you think you watched  any just like  almost like to  you know  that's  that's not to be sexy  but to see something  you know  whatever  like just the way  you would watch  something horrible  turn it off  well you know  what i'm saying  yeah nobody wants  to see their 
[03:12:30]  yeah  yeah  are you doing  a  are you doing  a cock on lips  now  a cock  excuse me  nothing  just a movie title  that somebody  popped up  oh it's an apocalypse  now  yes  a cock on lips  now  that's not bad  actually  yeah that's not a bad  one  they'll probably  offer you that  yeah  would you do it  would you do any  of your dad's  catchphrases  in a future film  um  i don't  i don't think  i would 
[03:13:00]  disrespect him  like that  yeah  that's  that's a little  much  do you think  you two  will make up  i mean  it's a stupid  question  i guess you  will right  yeah definitely  i mean  i love my father  unconditionally  so i don't  think this is  something we  won't move past  is he  was he  you said  your mother's  conservative  was he like  a conservative  guy or was  he uh  you know  hollywood guys  tend to be  a little bit  more liberal  minded  um  i mean  they're  they're both  pretty you know  conservative about  you know the  rules and stuff  and wanting to  us to be  you know straight 
[03:13:30]  and good kids  but you know  they're kind of  liberal too  he's he's  liberal and  free spirited  so i i think  it's something  we'll move past  but he's just  really upset  right  what's your  favorite uh  movie that  he's done  oh i love  boys in the hood  boys in the hood  is definitely  my favorite  oh wow yeah  i forgot he  played uh  uh the father  he played um  cuba gooding junior's  father he was great  that was a good one  yeah it sure was  that was a good one  yeah wonderful  i actually like all  the matrix ones  too 
[03:14:00]  yeah  classic too  morpheus  all right  well we did it i think  yeah montana  fishburn  it's a good movie  yeah  awesome you guys  anthony and opie  are the best  oh yeah  jimmy norton  asked most of the  questions  that's okay she  doesn't know  it's all right  hey they go to  montana exposed  dot com for the uh  for the porno  uh  www.vivid.com  montana exposed  yes  okay  okay  very good  i am fishburn  all right

[03:15:00]  mortified  that's good  yeah  you know what  you're right  that is her  boyfriend i think  yeah  and if she's  fucking her  boyfriend  this is a way  to get a  paris hilton  type sex tape  out there  without going  full stream  into the business  finishing high  school  oh wow  what happened  montana  here's what it  says  is this wikipedia  it's from  somebody  it sounds like  it sounds like  wikipedia but  it's a different  word at the  beginning  it says she

[03:19:30]  and you see  this is the  land of confusion  this is the  world we live  in  and these  are the  hands  we're  giving  you  tell me  let's  start  trying  to make  it a  place  worth  living  in  good choice  disturbed  doing land  of confusion  of course  the song  originally  done by 
[03:20:00]  genesis  that was a lot  of fun  yesterday  best cover  ever man  got turned  on to a lot  of good  music  yesterday  i want to  thank  the listeners  for doing  that  some good  ones out  there  absolutely  you know  what  just  got me  they were  doing  the dr  laura story  on fox  news  and they  always i mean  they've done  this with us  for years  and every radio  story  don't you  think that  people at  the tv  station  know  that  no one  uses  boards  with  vu 
[03:20:30]  meters  on them  anymore  oh it's  like an old  b-roll  of a radio  board  every time  they do a  story about  radio  they show  the board  and then  the gauge  is going  like old  aircraft  gauges  don't forget  the focus  in on the  on air  on the  on air  light  it's just  the same  it just  goes to  show you  what lack  of creativity  or anything  new is  going on  yeah jimmy's  a little  annoyed  and i don't  blame them  because we  got reasons  first i want to  say the mosque  people have  rejected an  offer to  find a new  place  of course  they have  yeah  so we  so that was 
[03:21:00]  fucking  not right  yesterday  no it was  incorrect  and i apologize  for saying  the incorrect  no it was  out there  i think  andy levy  was one of  the guys  that was  on that  one  saying no  this is  not true  he was the  one saying  it's not  true  i know we  want to  beat up  andy levy  and certainly  we can find  a lot of  things to  beat him up  about  but in  this case  he was the  one that  took that  on and  said this  is not  true  what's  being  reported  yeah well  why would  they care  about the  feelings of  9-11 victim  families  why would  they give  a fuck  unbelievable  why would  they  they don't 
[03:21:30]  have to  i'm glad  hamas agrees  with them  though  hamas agrees  with them  putting that  there  where the  towers were  knocked down  so that's  a great  we have a  really good  smart country  why wouldn't  we agree  with something  that hamas  agrees with  they strap  bombs on  their fucking  body  terrorist  organization  yeah  they  they  encourage  suicide  bombings  hamas  and this  was a  suicide  attack  so why  wouldn't  they  agree  with putting  a mosque  there  where there  was a  suicide  attack  great  great  it's a  lovely  religion 
[03:22:00]  and it's  a great  smart city  we live  in  a lot  of the  terrorists  do use  mosques  to meet  up with  each other  it's a  very safe  place  because it's  pretty  restricted  but you  can't say  that  right  i just  did  what's  the matter  nothing  our system  around here  just fucking  blows as you're  going to point  out as well  why we had a  it's too  inside i i get  a bunch of cds  thrown in front  of me and  ones i don't feel  like playing i  turn them over 
[03:22:30]  and like don't  show me them  again and they  just keep  appearing  like when the  same guest is  pitched 40  times  you say no to  a guest once  and it's back  the next week  but they're  really asking  why have a  system if we  can't figure it  out on a daily  basis  i don't want  to play  kanye west  acapella  tracks okay  let me see  that  i'll take  that  figured i'll  take a page  out of your  book  and while  we're at it  little wayne  calling funk  master flex  a show and  talks about a  day in rikers 
[03:23:00]  oh let me  hear that  let me see  that what's  he say on  funk master  i've been  turning over  that cd for  weeks that  means fucking  get it out of  my fucking  face  danny brought  up this thing  about and again  we don't know  if it's true or  not about her  boyfriend but  shit we had her  on the phone and  this would have  been a great  thing to ask  dan where'd  you find that  uh that was a  trap dog poll  travis oh  where'd you find  it i found it by  googling montana  fishburn there  you go now what  happens is you  know how when you  write a paper in 
[03:23:30]  english or whatever  and you have to  pad a little bit  so you write a  certain way like uh  you don't really  know much about  whatever history the  revolutionary war  like myself so  you write things  like waterloo but  you write all  waterloo you know  how you write extra  words and things to  pad it so it looks  like it's longer than  it is here's the  prep sheet okay page  one of one this  course double spaced  montana's stage name 
[03:24:00]  slash alias is  chippy d it's pretty  good oh you like  chippy d next  line she is 19  years old  how is that two  lines of preparation  she's been age 19  she is we're safe  to say we're almost  halfway through the  uh prep sheet yeah  just under just  under halfway with  those two fine bullet 
[03:24:30]  points her name and  her age and we're  already halfway down  the page on our one  sheet on montana  fishberg the film  features her in a  mall having sex in a  car and then again in  a hotel room that is  helpful that's actually  belongs there it's  pertinent sure why not  she has said she thinks  this video is an  important first step in  her career she looks at  the fame kim kardashian  got after her sex tape  and wants to emulate it  that is also helpful and 
[03:25:00]  pertinent but very wordy  very wordy yeah it  doesn't have to be that  word next one very  helpful her father  laurence fishberg in case  you didn't know has  contacted her only once  recently and it was to  tell her he won't speak  to her again he could  have just said page six  today but uh montana  says her mother worried  for her but wants her to  do what she feels but  that's actually helpful  too no the problem with  the prep sheet first of  all what you just read  did not come from uh the 
[03:25:30]  newspaper today no and  there's new facts in the  paper today that should  have been uh put on the  prep sheet i read that  because i was i was kind  of thumbing through the  paper but that should  have been on the prep  sheet you know that's  that the father there is  pissed off because no  one uses their real name  in porn that should have  been on the prep sheet  can we are not on the  prep sheet maybe the  exact producer could  come in i'm sure there's  a reason for it i'm not  going to throw him  under the bus  and who would that be  stunt brain  now bring steve in i know 
[03:26:00]  steve pie has a reason  i'm not going to throw  him under the bus i want  to ask actually no you'll  hurt the bus  um if you could just  keep that could you  throw me under a russ  see because he's gay  throw me under a russ  no one is named russ  no i couldn't think of  anything steve epic fail on  the pressure epic fail on 
[03:26:30]  the uh prep sheet for  montana fish i understand  epic fail and what about  the pimp thing what about  the stuff that was in the  paper today the pimp thing  i didn't know and i didn't  write the prep sheet and i'm  not  oh responsibility  executive producer i understand  that i understand that i  understand that anybody  baseball team sucks a dick  guess what i know i know  they blame the fucking  manager i know players  believe me and that's the  way it works so i have to  accept responsibility it  doesn't matter who fucked  up you're like joe bory  doesn't matter who fucked up  it's my responsibility you  going over all this stuff  after they put the prep 
[03:27:00]  sheet together to make sure  they're not uh missing  something considering also  that you are a guy that's  into porn in general not as  much as i used to be but  yeah you're right um and  i'm sorry can i see the  page dan that you had up  before because that's a big  one because we do have here  she was reportedly arrested  for prostitution last year  which i asked her about right  but that that i didn't know  she had a movie before this  i didn't either i didn't  either i didn't know i didn't  know this yeah but that's  something you should this 
[03:27:30]  is not her first porn even  if i didn't know she moved  out of her father's house  or that her fucking a  boyfriend's been alleged to  be a pimp even though  someone else is doing the  prep sheet you should be  doing a little like prepping  at least google the fucking  broad i honestly danny  google the fucking broad and  we found this i honestly  don't know where he found  it i didn't notice there  wasn't a foundry logo on the  first film so who did the  prep sheet uh sam did ah sam  slipping you know why he does  too many radio shows no it's  not a good prep sheet i mean  we missed a couple of  important things we missed 
[03:28:00]  what was in the paper today  yeah it's not a good prep  sheet but the important  thing is you dude you got  it you're the you're the  guy man it's it all comes  because i'm thinking of  other shows and again i know  we're not them and they're  not us but when you look at  certain preparation that  goes into interviews  baba booey um oh what did  you say that or do i think  it sometimes i just think that  i've actually yelled out  while eating my  girlfriend's pussy she has  no idea why um i would  love to do that by the way  how great would that be if  if if i was eating a girl's  pussy and she was a big 
[03:28:30]  howard fan i just started  yelling baba booey into her  vagina and she came on my  face end of story let's let's  have an experiment i want to  know if that can make a girl  fucking calm just saying it  over and over again but uh the  one thing i did know about was  the music video with brian  pumper and then danny showed  me that it wasn't actually a a  piece of a porno movie which i  did not know i thought it was  just a music video why isn't  that on the uh prep it's a  music video it's a music video  and she caught porn no but it  wasn't fucked in the ass i  didn't know it was a porn  movie different than a hip  hop i didn't know it was a  porn movie i thought it was 
[03:29:00]  just a music video for this  fucking guy who wanted to be  an ex hamster but that said  it was but that one they  don't just have regular  fucking music videos on  ex hamster i didn't i  honestly dude it was on  fucking youtube when i saw  it but but dude the the  trav dog or a t h whatever  the fucking i saw justin  bieber on red tube can we  play the 35 minute version  of the justin bieber song  that everyone's talking  about oh geez they slowed  it down 800 times or  whatever it was did you  listen to any of it no i 
[03:29:30]  hear it's kind of cool it's  weird it sounds like we  it sounds like a film  score like it's really  strange all right we're  gonna have to like play it  now that we brought it to  everyone's attention but but  let's beat up steve a little  more i don't even want to  beat him up it's just it  makes us look sweet that was  a really important thing to  ask because if it's  alleged at least that the  boyfriend was a pimp we  could have looked into the  fact has he been arrested  that's probably not that hard  to find and her boyfriend  had been and again if  that's a big if if he had  been arrested and charged  with being a pimp that is  a huge thing to ask her 
[03:30:00]  about as opposed to just  the guy that she likes that  she's fucking then the  whole dynamic of the  interview even changes  mm-hmm yeah i mean you  know what i mean that's a  big one man because she's  not as innocent as we  thought by seeing the one  tape why isn't that might  have been done with her  boyfriend now it looks like  brian pumper's a porn star  there you go second tape  of her why isn't sam in  here defending himself i i  don't know where's sam sam's  never under the bus yeah  where is he he's standing 
[03:30:30]  right outside the studio with  a pair of headphones on okay  well get him oh here's boss  where is he where's fiancee  all right look who's in the  fucking shitter now what steve  would take the heat i was just  oh you're hoping steve would  take the heat what happened  she's 19 years old there's not  probably a line well most of that  stuff is not you know it's so  you can easily glance down and  look at it so montana you're um 
[03:31:00]  19 years old jimmy looks he just  glanced down yeah uh any defense  and i mean well the uh second  porno tape no that that was a  mishap but the pimp stuff we  didn't know the boyfriend's name  until she said it on the air but um  how did you get it when uh because  it is you're right tattooed on a  pussy but i couldn't read it either  how did we uh by googling the  boyfriend's name along with hers but 
[03:31:30]  if you just google her do you find  that i think you can because like  the article that i was the article  that i was reading uh is from  august 6th how about this google  montana fishburn prostitution oh  that's the most to me that's the  most interesting part of this entire  story is that before porn she was  prostituting which for a celebrity's  daughter to allegedly be  prostituting it goes to the well in  all fairness to sam we had that story  like see she was arrested last week  ago she was arrested that was 
[03:32:00]  something that let me say so we  could have said well you're saying  not true but e online is reporting  that you were arrested for  prostitution last year she was  arrested reportedly arrested for  prostitution i asked her that and  she said no her boyfriend being a  pimp is not meant to see i think we  need more info then we could go well  you're saying no but then uh how do  you defend yourself as far as what e  online is saying about it i mean i  could have sourced it but it does it  says she was reportedly arrested what  is he online saying about the  prostitution oh boy oh this show 
[03:32:30]  business and finance that's seems  like a cheese reputable source for  news you poor son of a bitch see  because then we could have quoted  some of these things they're saying  in these articles we had nothing else  to go on we just had to go okay  okay that looks like her light-skinned  boyfriend no that guy's not that  light-skinned is that her boyfriend  jeremy or no he's light-skinned  he's slightly darker than saying  it's like sam he's got the same  hair as sam and everything  jesus h christ yeah we're looking at 
[03:33:00]  this agree that states that anybody  says anybody that's getting paid or  compensated for the act of sex is  engaged in prostitution but that would  stand to reason that if she appears in  an adult film that she's engaged in the  act of prostitution yeah i mean all i  mean the only way we found out i i mean  i guess oh boy he doesn't sound  confident he's stammering a little bit  he's stammering articles that say  their boyfriend was a pimp until we  found out her boyfriend's name and i 
[03:33:30]  didn't know her boyfriend's name  until she said it no but just doing  googling her prostitution that gets a  little bit deeper and deeper that uh  deeper but i also like we can't give  like i've given you bigger long sheet  bigger one sheets that are multiple  pages with you know paragraphs right and  you guys have said they're too long no  i agree but oh shit now it's our fault  no it's not your fault at all now the  information helps roberts blaming jim  norton oh my god he blamed jimmy right  there i would write to his face he goes  you guys said that they're too long and 
[03:34:00]  hard to read so we did say that oh boy  but that's what that's what summarizing  is we should have a while we could  summarize and say yes we should have a  prep sheet with the basics on the front  and then if you want to go deeper on  some of this shit you got a second page  why don't you just call a middle of the  road jim the way uh it's you we should  get uh and this is to both of you we  should get like with red eye they send  their notes you get your your topics and  then you get the research they did which  is usually a nice long article on each  subject so you can write about it they 
[03:34:30]  don't just tell you the makes me panic  sometimes when they're really long i'm  like oh yeah i just go through and i  do shit up yeah that's what i do smart  but uh yeah we should have some kind of  what a sad end to today's show why  sad it's just like links before like  the night before we could send you an  email with cufflinks print i print it  out you could link but i'd rather print  it out because i won't go to links i  could say i wouldn't lie can we print  out articles the morning of it's like  sometimes with research if you look a  little deeper you'll find and maybe 
[03:35:00]  that's my job as an interviewer somebody  who's going to talk to someone but when  you look a little deeper you can find a  lot of stuff can we cut to the chase  bring in eric we all know it's his  fault he did he wasn't even here  yesterday to help somehow that could  have been a big guarantee this goes  right back to eric wow sam's a piece  of shit oh oh boy that's coming in  you're taking the brunt of this from  jess on whack bag oh they're calling  you shock master to be fair this wasn't 
[03:35:30]  travis's uh email uh his news email on  august 8th oh all right well yeah i  mean we've had the articles wait what  did august 8th uh say lawrence  fishburne's porn star daughter was  also busted for prostitution last year  and all we had to do is like click a  link on an email yeah but who goes back  to august 8th and looks at emails well  that's true but then there were you look  at travis's emails i mean not i twitter  from them there's the article first it  said she was busted for prostitution then  she already had come out and said she  hadn't been busted for prostitution so 
[03:36:00]  that's why all i could write was she  was reportedly arrested for  prostitution last year damn sam's gonna  be a good lawyer someday no but he's  not wrong to say that we did have the  article okay fine we did have it but i  think that we should have been informed  that her uh boyfriend was a pimp there's  a way to find that by a little research i  just want someone in trouble going going  forward i can make sure you all have  printouts of articles to that'll be you  keep going forward out the door exactly  going forward that this is a fire  until you're on sixth avenue yeah that'll  be up to bladder being struck right 
[03:36:30]  bladder will decide if we go forward not  to throw you under the bus but you're  the you're the boss man and it's like  we we can't guys who do really good  interviews going going going really  prepared and that's the fucking key is  to be very like for instance when i did  my really uh hour with ozzy alone all  right two friends yeah but i mean it's  like you fucking you know you got to  have 50 fucking questions he knew that  ozzy was arrested for prostitution  exactly was able to come out and say it 
[03:37:00]  because i actually offered him money to  blow him of course they arrested him by  mistake but you know what i'm saying  it's like can i can i ask larry king  who's to blame here larry who's to  blame here in person oh my god oh sam  in person oh sam just isn't right  generalized answer that is in person oh  he said it again oh in person i know  yeah yeah oh boy keep fucking that 
[03:37:30]  chicken that's all we can hope for us  keep fucking that chicken very sad end to  the show maybe the justin bieber thing  could make everyone happy before we leave  baby kid is good oh uncle paul you hear  he sings like a bird you like justin  bieber what do you like about him he's  got cute hairdo like i like i want to  moss it and go like ah get over here rub  his stomach it's like right down to his 
[03:38:00]  eyeballs that uh yeah he looks like a  little dutch boy you like the dutch boy  look on a young lad yeah i used to get in  trouble for rubbing myself through my  pockets in the paint section  paint store the dutch boy paint you would  jerk off to the dutch boy paint i would  look at that kid hanging with his little  feet dangling on that paint can who  didn't want to just tussle his hair a  little never thought of being sexually  aroused by the dutch boy paint can 
[03:38:30]  thank you damn he's look at him he's  sitting on a little swing he is waving  and he's got little wooden shoes  little wooden shoes you can hear him  you can hear him clip-clopping around  the house like a little a little horsey  yeah where they can't hide from you  yeah where are you and you hear him 
[03:39:00]  clip-clopping with his little hat he  would wear that hat and his little blonde  hair would poke out his dutch boy hairdo  says dutch boy on it looks like buster  brown too yeah he does oh look at the  little rosy cheeks you want to just  pinch him he's wearing coveralls and  that means easy access uncle paul you  just unsnap him and tell him now go  running and they all fall down and he  trips skins his little knees that dutch  boy kid you gotta kiss them all better 
[03:39:30]  right i think he's 58 now the kid that  posed for that picture  ew oh where's the uh bieber i'd love to  hear a little of the slowed down bieber  oh yeah let me get that and it's uh 800  percent they slowed it down  yeah oh yeah yeah what do you what do you  want to happen here jimmy this is your  fight i'm not even fighting you want  anyone fired no i'm not even angry i just  wish that we had had that yeah we wish  that it was better today we're all just  sad now yeah sad the pimp thing's a big 
[03:40:00]  one the prostitution we have with the  pimp thing  and obviously she fucked on film mob  before this yes i did not know that we're  talking about it like it was her first  movie  yeah like she was one and done and here it  was too two and done doesn't even rhyme  two and through  you're two and go danny what's the just a  bieber thing i don't know  i don't know someone slowed it down  what 800 times or something yeah it's  800 percent slower but i think they  they maintain 800 percent they maintain 
[03:40:30]  the pitch or something because it  doesn't sound like and is it his hit  song it's not going like song no it's  it's odd it just i'm telling you it  sounds like ambient it sounds like a  film score  really yeah it's like i want to make a  movie and just use this listen oh you  could say that again  justin bieber slow down  this is how it is whenever kenny talks 
[03:41:00]  kind of sounds like that's eerie  sounds like religious stuff  sounds like sling blade when carl goes  back to his father's house yeah he 
[03:41:30]  finds a little feller i'm your boy name  a carl yeah little feller any and your  fans out there yes i want to get jerked  off to this music  what great massage music all you have to  do to jerk off to it is speed it up by  800 percent  yes yes i'm gay i hated him when i  thought his name was justin beaver  what are you doing oh i'm justin 
[03:42:00]  beaver  only 34 more minutes to go folks oh that  is amazing how long of it they sort of  out 800 times  800 percent i don't know i guess divide  by eight that does just sound like some  kind of a weird  yeah movie score  who would why they do this 
[03:42:30]  2001 a space odyssey i don't know  or the sound and apocalypse now in the  helicopters were fucking flying  yeah very good yeah  with that beautiful sunrise yeah that young  god i love a good i can never watch  cornbread earl and me again without  thinking that the little boy in there  put coming a lady x amount of years  later and pumped out this young porn star  yeah young cornbread earl and me oh  shit 
[03:43:00]  wow that went stereo too it's going back  and forth  it's very uh it's powerful it's great any uh hearts of space fans out there  anyone remember the hearts of space series no okay  this fucking rules how much time before rod and fez  damn man let's fuck them bad today 
[03:43:30]  it's hypnotic  uh you still got another about thirty two and a half minutes  really  hey that's a good idea steve and ask for bayshore  could have used this at uh i'm gonna do a montage of all the sunrise and sunset pictures i've gotten over last year  oh to this  and then just have this in the background  it's arth vader in there  i heard a little  it's nice it sounds like waves crashing on the beach 
[03:44:00]  yeah  yeah who thought to do this  somebody on quaaludes  the sad part is this is the first ten seconds of the original song  that's what i was gonna ask  oh my god probably  i've never heard the original i can't even  i don't know  figure out  what is  what song is it 
[03:44:30]  it's a real toe tap it danny  it's called you smile  you want to play a little  you don't know  i could probably not have it  come on how do we not have it  believe it or not  we've only got like  six justin bieber songs  no  you're probably spelling it wrong  b e e  you want  let's let's hear this  what should i do with this  just not  yeah this  it'll wait  you sure  it'll hold  pause it  you sure  it's not gonna wreck the song  if we pause it  i'm afraid to stop it 
[03:45:00]  like something bad's gonna happen  no it's wonderful  you know what's gonna happen  if you stop it  every dick is in  does it feel weird now  you're gonna have a bad day danny  every dick just went back to soft  danny's gonna have a bad fucking day  alright let's hear it  now this is what we were listening to  i guess  and here it is  oh i heard that part  that part took two minutes  alright i remember hearing that  that's probably all we heard 
[03:45:30]  because now we're 20 seconds into the song  i like the other one better  yeah let's go back to the other one  waves  waves are coming in 
[03:46:00]  this is what the whales are saying  they  you  you  that's you  oh they're saying  this is inspired  possibly by the  inception soundtrack  thank you chris  and uh  betton harbor  this sounds a lot like 
[03:46:30]  the main theme of that movie  oh yeah  alright  it's a weird movie  was it good  i don't know  i don't know  i want someone to do this  with me singing  beth i hear you calling  oh man  yeah  i bet every song  slowed down  800%  would sound just like this  i can't go to the phones  any in cleveland  two years ago  someone did this  to beethoven's  ninth symphony  and it took 24 hours 
[03:47:00]  to play  wow  wow  wonder how that sounds  i would listen to this  whole fucking thing  at my house today  i literally  i'm not kidding  this is massage music  i could definitely  fall asleep to this  it's cool  the original kind of stinks  yeah  yeah  all right
