<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a discussion about their wildly popular "WOW" stickers and the logistical nightmares of managing their promotional events ("Whip Them Out Wednesday").  They boasted about their loyalty only to themselves, contrasting this with past radio station allegiances.  The mood shifted abruptly to a serious discussion of a horrific car accident caused by a drunk and high driver with a BAC of 0.19, resulting in multiple deaths.  Listeners called in with their own stories, including one who claimed a 0.39 BAC.  The hosts criticized the media's focus on the driver's marijuana use over her significantly higher alcohol level.

The show then veered into humorous territory with a detailed analysis of True TV's "Party Heat: Wet, Wild and Under Arrest," focusing on the intoxicated spring breakers arrested at Lake Havasu.  The hosts commented extensively on the arrestees' appearances and the officers' behavior, speculating about whether attractive individuals received preferential treatment.  They briefly discussed Paula Abdul's departure from American Idol, suggesting she was fired but allowed to claim she resigned.  A quick mention of a Tiger Woods "fartgate" incident (actually involving a golf analyst) followed.

The Paula Abdul firing/resignation became a recurring theme, interwoven with discussions of various "-gate" scandals (Spygate, Troopergate, Watergate;  they even briefly mentioned staying at the Watergate Hotel).  Bill Clinton's trip to North Korea to secure the release of two American journalists sparked humorous speculation about his motives.  The hosts criticized President Obama's perceived lack of involvement.  A lengthy, graphic segment followed, detailing the harsh realities of life in Africa, including a documentary about breast reduction in young girls to prevent rape.

The conversation then shifted to Nick Cannon and Nas's music video, "Eat That Watermelon," which featured blackface.  A lengthy debate ensued about its meaning and intent, with callers offering varied opinions, some suggesting it satirized "coonery" in hip-hop while others disagreed.  Snippets of the song were played, and comparisons were drawn to similar racially charged songs, including Opie and Anthony's own past bit, "Fry That Chicken."  Other rappers like OJ the Juice Man and Gucci Mane were also discussed. The hosts also discussed media bias in covering white versus black crime, punctuated by a humorous aside about a woman in a Partridge Family dress walking by.  They capped off the discussion of Paula Abdul with the "Paula Abdul quits Idol due to impacted colon" Google bomb. A segment of auto-tuned news stories played.

The next segment began with a discussion of auto-tune and the dangers of texting while driving, followed by a music request. A staff member's complaint about obtaining a SiriusXM package led to a frustrated rant about the company's policies.  The hosts expressed outrage over posters depicting Barack Obama as the Joker, engaging in a highly offensive debate about political humor and free speech, comparing it to similar parodies of George W. Bush and Hillary Clinton.  The “Piss Christ” artwork was also discussed.  A live feed of Bill Clinton's arrival in California after the journalists' release from North Korea provided further fodder for crude jokes about Clinton's sexual history, the journalists, and other targets, with increasingly offensive and misogynistic language.  Jim Jefferies joined the show in studio near the end of this segment.  They continued their speculation on Paula Abdul's departure with further offensive language.


The return of the two American journalists from North Korea was a focal point, with the hosts providing running commentary on the televised event, focusing on Clinton's appearance (his red face), Al Gore's presence, and the journalists' statements.  Crude jokes and sexual innuendo dominated the discussion, including a mention of a "greatest pussy video" featuring a nude skydiver.  They speculated on the journalists' experiences and the motives of Clinton and Gore.  The conversation also touched upon a comedian's first-pitch experience, Jim Jefferies' new DVD and LA experiences, and numerous caller interactions, mostly revolving around the hosts' views on mothers.  Jim Norton’s voicemail about an acting gig was also played.  The segment concluded with further discussion of the journalists' release and Obama's comments, interspersed with more off-color humor and speculation.

A caller, Mary from Missouri, initiated a discussion about the hosts’ provocative style, stating she enjoyed the show despite disagreeing with much of their content.  This led to a conversation about the awkwardness of casual sex encounters when children are present, featuring increasingly vulgar and explicit anecdotes from the hosts and a caller, Jay.  The discussion involved graphic depictions of sex with minors and crude jokes about incest. Mary’s complaint about feeling ignored unless the hosts discussed sex and breasts prompted a further humorous, offensive exchange about the perceived sagginess of Native American women's breasts.  The segment concluded with promotional material for Jim Jefferies' website and DVD, interwoven with continued sexually explicit and offensive banter, including more crude jokes about Native Americans and Mary's breasts, and another playing of “Eat That Watermelon”.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  What day is it? Wednesday.  I believe Wednesday.  Now, a few people have started tweeting pictures of the brand new WOW stickers.  Yes.  And I went to myself, hey, that's pretty cool.  Yeah.  Who's doing that?  Do we have new WOW stickers that are going out?  Yeah, apparently. I saw some pictures of them, too.  I didn't even know. 
[00:00:30]  So, are we actually organized?  Well, yeah. I mean, it's the same rules.  You know, send a self-addressed stamped envelope over here, and now we'll get you a brand new WOW sticker.  Is there like a promo running on the channel?  There should be.  If not, it's send a self-addressed stamped envelope to 1221 6th Avenue.  Keep going.  New York, New York, 10020.  So, WOW stickers, courtesy of Sirius XM Radio.  36th floor. 
[00:01:00]  Attention, Opie and Anthony.  Hey, it's not my name.  Yeah.  Put all that information on an envelope.  I would assume there's some kind of promo running on the channel.  I would hope.  Because people are getting them, so.  Yeah.  You know something I don't know.  What's this?  The 18th incarnation of the sticker?  What's on there?  What's on there?  Does it just say Sirius Satellite Radio?  Sirius XM, like the logo on those things.  Oh, Sirius XM.  At this point, it's the same WOW logo, and we're just like erasing.  All right, where are we working now? 
[00:01:30]  Where are we working now?  All right, just stamp that on the top.  Remember the days when we were stupid and we actually had loyalty for a radio company?  Yeah.  That's stupid.  Loyalty is stupid.  Loyalty sucks.  And you'd go rah, rah, rah.  Fuck the other guy.  Fuck him in the ass.  Fuck him hard.  Oh, wait a minute.  Now we work for the other guy.  Oh, well, the station we used to work for, they actually treat us bad. 
[00:02:00]  Ah, fuck them in the ass now.  Screw them.  Now it's like, ah.  Whatever.  You know what it is?  We're loyal to ourselves, Opie and Anthony.  Everyone else can go fuck themselves.  Whatever that logo is in the upper left-hand corner of the sticker.  Is that where it is?  Yeah.  Then that's what it is.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  There it is.  Oh, lower right.  Lower right this time.  I got it completely wrong.  Well, that's crazy.  There is one of the stickers.  Wow.  There it is.  Literally.  Wow. 
[00:02:30]  Huh?  Nice, right?  Why are you showing everyone?  It's the same sticker.  The same.  It says exactly it.  It just has a serious XM thing.  And then they're going to have to make new ones when they completely get rid of the XM  portion of the serious XM logo.  Did you ever think when we just started working for XM that we'd ever be on a sticker with  serious doggie on it?  No, of course not.  With the little serious doggie?  No.  And we got to get this wow thing going again.  We really do.  Yeah.  It's time.  For the new listeners, it's a fine promotion called Whip Them Out Wednesday. 
[00:03:00]  And the women out there, you know, they flash guys that have the wow stickers on their cars.  They're boopies.  Or if they have like wow written, you know, in the dirt on the back of the truck.  Yep.  In the windows, you know.  I still see it.  Homemade wow stickers are cool to see.  I still see it and everything.  But you know what kind of takes away from it?  There's the sticker and there's send for the sticker.  And then there's the people are wowing out there.  But we don't have the ability to do like the events anymore because there's no events 
[00:03:30]  anymore.  Because we're too big for that.  No, it's the company.  Oh, I mean, yeah.  It's the company.  Yeah, it's the company.  It's what it is.  It's just that that's why we really got to move our shift.  Is that what it is?  Because, you know, it was just very natural to do our radio show and go, hey, you know  that local bar on whatever street? 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, we're going to be down there.  We're going to be there in 10 minutes.  We're going to have the new wow stickers.  We're going to have girls with boobs.  We're going to have everything.  Yeah.  Now what do we do?  We all meet for coffee after this show?  Who the fuck has time for that?  We yawn and run home to bed.  To go to bed like grandpa.  That's ridiculous.  My niece is up from Florida.  I'm like, well, good night.  I was 930.  She's like, but you're not old.  What are you doing?  I know.  It's my job and I can't stay up or blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:04:30]  Dumb job.  So anyway, the wow stickers are being printed.  Limited edition.  Limited edition.  Kind of like that Michael Jackson lithograph.  Of a lithograph.  Of course.  There are only 30 printing days, which I think they can only run off 85 billion in that amount  of time.  But it still makes it a limited edition.  Limited edition.  Knowing this company, they threw us a bone and they printed out stickers for five seconds.  Thanks.  Yeah.  The run is only for five actual rotations of the printing machine.  Right. 
[00:05:00]  So there's only five stickers.  So keep listening to this channel on how you could get your own wow stickers.  Yeah.  I guess that's what we do there.  Wow.  Big news stories.  Let's get the depressing news out of the way.  That mother that went the wrong way on the Taconic, which is north of New York City for people  listening from somewhere else, she goes the wrong way on a highway for, I think, two miles  and kills everybody.  Yeah. 
[00:05:30]  Just destroys everybody.  Stuff like her son.  It's the only one that lived.  Right.  Like, well, yeah, her son.  But she died.  Nieces, a daughter, then a whole, like, three guys in another vehicle.  Yeah.  Just dead.  I mean, if you're driving the wrong way on a highway, eventually you're going to hit  something.  And everyone was depressed.  And we don't even know.  We don't even know these people.  But it makes you sad anyway, because you think of your own family and you think of your own  friends and kids and all that crap.  And we had the discussion, like, how does that happen? 
[00:06:00]  How do you get going the wrong way on a highway when it's so obvious you're going the wrong  way?  And, you know, with kids in the car, you're speculating, like, what was wrong with this  woman?  Was she distracted?  Was it this?  Well, the news did come out.  Yes.  It sure did.  Wow.  She was very drunk and very high.  Yeah.  She had twice the legal limit in her, as far as the alcohol goes.  Yeah.  And they also figured out that she smoked pot, what, 15 to 45 minutes, did they say? 
[00:06:30]  Or 15 minutes to an hour?  Yeah, 15 to a half hour, something like that.  She smoked pot.  They could tell that she had pot in her system that she smoked within a half hour, 40 minutes  of the crash.  Yeah, her blood alcohol was fucked up.  She was fucked up.  She was a 0.19, and she still had undigested vodka in her stomach, and they found a broken  vodka bottle, so they assumed she was just drinking it as she was driving along.  I really wish I had an expert or two in studio that could explain what a 0.19 alcohol level 
[00:07:00]  is.  Anyone?  Anyone?  I don't think I've ever blown a 0.19.  But could you tell us what that is?  Oh, it's 0.19% of your blood is alcohol.  By the way, you didn't raise your hand.  It's hammered.  But in terms we can understand, like, how many drinks is that?  Oh, probably about 10 fucking vodka drinks.  About 10 vodka drinks, and she still had more in her stomach, so. 
[00:07:30]  And high on weed.  When you say she still had more in her stomach, does that mean the alcohol level would have  went up even higher?  Yes.  Holy.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, it would have been up even higher.  So it could have been more than 10 drinks?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  They're saying definitely, like, the equivalent of 10 vodka drinks.  10 drinks, like fucking vodka drinks, not, you know, little wussy drinks.  Uh, of vodka, yeah, just, and then weed on top of it.  Oh, my God.  How much weed? 
[00:08:00]  I don't know, but enough where you don't even need that much weed when you're that drunk.  That's true.  Then you're just incapacitated.  You can't even walk.  A little.  You're, like, sitting on the couch just going, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  A little one-hitter or something, a little dugout.  Yeah, yeah.  A little dugout.  The dugout.  The little baseball bat.  Yeah.  You ever smoke it that way?  That way back in the old days.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  So you're a lot older than me.  What can I tell you?  Jesus. 
[00:08:30]  Uh, yeah, so she, uh, she apparently was driving like a maniac, uh, before she got into the  accident.  Even before she got on the Taconic.  She was beeping her horn at people, flashing lights.  Why?  Because she thought everyone else was going the wrong way?  No, this was when everybody was going the right way.  Like, she was on the highway just driving on the shoulder to pass people and just driving  like a maniac.  And then she, uh, she gets onto the Taconic the wrong way, drives about two miles, and 
[00:09:00]  then head on, boom.  Jesus.  Everyone just, uh, flies out of the vehicle dead.  So this could have been avoided.  Oh, completely.  That's basically what we're saying today.  Another alcohol-related.  And then, and then you got to see all the dead people on the front page of the paper today.  I know, they show them all smiling kids.  Dead.  Allison, seven.  Dead.  Katie, five.  Dead.  Emma, eight.  Dead.  Mike, an older dude.  Dead.  Guy.  What a father and son lost their lives to?  Yeah.  And then one of their friends were in the car with them. 
[00:09:30]  It was just, oh my God.  So that's, so that broke, uh, yesterday that she was very drunk and a bit on the high side.  Yeah, she had called her brother at some point and said that she was having trouble seeing  and she was kind of disoriented.  Right.  And her brother told her to stay there.  And, you know, I guess he was going to come and get them.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, she decided, uh, against that and thought she, you know, would drive away.  The wrong way.  Yeah, the wrong way and kill everybody. 
[00:10:00]  Uh.  Unbelievable.  Let me go to Biff in Brooklyn.  Biff.  What's up, guys?  How you doing?  Pretty good, Biff.  Biff.  Just want to say, uh, I have to blow in a breathalyzer every morning for work because  I got caught drinking.  And, uh, 0.19 is not very high at all.  I've drank in about eight beers, stopped at 11.30 p.m.  And at 6 a.m. the next morning, I'm blowing 0.16.  Don't forget how many hours later.  Actually, the highest I've ever blown is a 0.39, which that's pretty high. 
[00:10:30]  What are you, 8,000 pounds?  You can't blow up.  No, actually, uh, 185.  See?  You can't, you can't call a national show and say 0.19 is not a lot.  That's, you're crazy.  For me, anyway.  I don't know.  All right.  All right.  That's crazy.  We've had a breathalyzer over the house.  And, uh.  That's dead.  Yeah.  0.39.  Dude, you're dead.  It's like ridiculous, right?  I have a chart.  There's a chart here, and, uh, it gives body weight to blood alcohol content. 
[00:11:00]  Death, death possible.  Death, yeah.  Death is definitely possible when you start getting into those, uh.  The 0.3s.  Yeah.  I mean, the highest on this chart is 0.38, and.  And that's dead.  It's in the red.  You're dead, dude.  And that's dead.  But that guy's saying that's no big deal.  That's the highest he's blown.  I mean, he's got it a little wrong, obviously.  I, uh.  His decimal point might be off.  If, I know when I blow, when I blow into the breathalyzer there, um, and I've been, like,  drinking beers, uh, I usually don't even hit, like, 0.08. 
[00:11:30]  I usually don't even hit, like, legally drunk, and I'm feeling, you know, pretty good.  Yeah.  So, if I was at a 0.19, I'd be falling down.  Of course.  Now, here is, and I'm glad people are calling with this, because I noticed this yesterday,  too, when this story broke.  But the stupid, and I mean stupid, media, which we certainly are not a part of.  Yeah.  We're maybe an offshoot of the media.  You know, I like to think we're, we're in a special category of the media. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Maybe not as, uh, as, as wonderful as a Jon Stewart, but at least in that way where we're  pointing out a lot of this, this ridiculousness that the media does on a regular basis.  The anti-media man.  You know that they're pointing out the fact that she was high, like, that was a way more  of a big deal than the, than the drinking?  Yeah, right.  The highness.  Well, if you're drinking and high, then the pot does kind of magnify it. 
[00:12:30]  But, if you were just smoking a little weed.  They're not mentioning the alcohol as much.  Oh, really?  Or in some cases.  Thank you.  Let me go to Dave in Tennessee, because this is the one I saw myself.  Go ahead, Dave.  Yeah, CNN, man.  I heard it on my, my XM this morning, uh, the report.  The first thing they say is large amounts of marijuana in her blood, because that's the  sensational part.  Right.  And then real quickly, oh, and she had some alcohol too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're downplaying the alcohol, because in this country, we've already accepted the 
[00:13:00]  alcohol thing.  Yeah.  Completely accepted that.  And, uh, we all know that alcohol is a little more dangerous than pot.  Yeah.  It really is.  Just to give you an example, I'm, I deliver newspapers, and, uh, I'm high right now.  You know, I've been doing it for 10 years.  I ain't never had a problem.  Mm-hmm.  I'm punching out, guys.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  What happened?  Someone's not getting their daily delivery.  You were going there, too?  Of course. 
[00:13:30]  Uh, let me go to Cody in Jersey.  Cody.  Yo, guys.  I don't know what's wrong with driving on the wrong side of the road.  John Candy did it.  He planes trains and automobiles.  He sure did.  Yeah.  The only wrong way.  Yeah.  That is one of the greatest, well, I was going to say one of the greatest scenes.  Maybe not one of the greatest scenes, but, God, that movie is just great.  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  John Candy was a vision of a dress up as a devil laughing at Steve Martin.  Yeah.  That whole scene was well done. 
[00:14:00]  Thank you, sir.  Let me go to Kevin in Connecticut.  Kevin.  Hi, guys.  Hey, Kevin.  And you said she was talking to her brother on the phone?  Yeah.  So she was drunk, high, and talking on the phone.  Yeah.  Well, apparently she had pulled over to talk to her brother on the phone.  Oh.  On the other side of the road or the right side of the road?  No, that was when she had pulled off and then when she got done and got back on or something  or she was at the place where she could get back on.  What did the brother say that got her back on the road? 
[00:14:30]  No, he was the one that said, stay there.  Oh.  He said, stay there.  I'll, you know, come and get you.  By the way, I've never been too high to drive, so.  Too high, but you've been too drunk, right?  Questionable.  But there's been a million bits about it, too.  If you're really high, I mean, you're going, what, 10 miles an hour on the road?  If you're really drunk, you're going about 100.  Yeah.  You know, I think you should.  Bill Hicks has a great bit on the whole alcohol versus pot thing, if you want to find a little 
[00:15:00]  taste of that there, Travis.  Yeah, I think you should definitely, if you find yourself in a situation where you are  driving, not at a .19 because you absolutely shouldn't be driving, but, you know, you could  be on the limit.  You could be .07 and you're still impaired a bit.  You put on the cruise control.  And that way, that's one less thing to worry about is how fast you're going.  Dude.  Then you just 10 and 2 it, right lane, and drive nicely all the way home. 
[00:15:30]  I would love to agree with you, but cruise control sucks a big, hairy dick.  Are you kidding me?  Because there's always someone that fucks up your cruise control in front of you.  Well, if it's late at night.  Oh, all right.  If there's no one on the road.  Yeah, that's usually what it is.  Okay.  But, I mean, on a regular driving day, cruise control sucks the big one.  It becomes a game.  It's a fucking pain in the ass.  Can I move?  Can I get around this person before I have to?  Damn it, I've got to step on the brake. 
[00:16:00]  And you're always just getting so mad at the car in front of you.  And they're probably not really doing anything that wrong, but they're just in your way  of your cruise control.  If they're in front of me, they're doing something wrong.  And it's not like you have your cruise control on 85.  Usually, if you do the cruise control, you're keeping it relatively within the limit.  Well, the reason to do cruise control is where you keep it, you know, just at the limit where  if you pass a cop, he'll go, eh, eh, I'll let him go.  I haven't used cruise control in years.  Really?  It's just too much of a pain in the ass.  And too frustrating. 
[00:16:30]  On the open road.  Man.  Man.  We've got a retired cop, Charlie, in Staten Island.  We don't know much about this Staten Island.  We just know we pass through it from time to time.  Used to be a dump.  Yeah.  Charlie.  There's a big mall there.  Is there?  Yeah.  There's always traffic between, like, the outer borough.  Yeah.  Or the Gothels and the Verrazano.  It's only got, like, one highway.  I know there's people that live in, like, the woods and stuff.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:17:00]  People live in the woods.  And they've got some kind of weird, like, Tasmanian devil-looking thing they're trying  to capture.  They've got fairies.  Fairies?  Fairies.  Staten Island fairy.  What do you got, Charlie?  Okay, good morning, gentlemen.  Hey.  When they teach us in class to do the alcohol testing, 12 ounces of beer or a glass of wine  or one shot of alcohol is 0.025.  And then your body will release 0.015 per hour. 
[00:17:30]  So you could do the math to tell how much she drank to get to that point.  Ah.  So basically four drinks will put you over the limit, but then every hour your body's taking  some of that back.  Yes.  And then you can take that on a 180-pound person.  So if she was point, let's call it 0.4, that would be 16 drinks, right, sir?  I don't, I'm neither a math person.  0.4, she'd be dead. 
[00:18:00]  That's about 16 drinks because doing your math, it's what, four per 0.1, and she was just under  four.  So let's call it 16 drinks, and then give her maybe a couple hours.  So then she drops how much at that point?  0.015.  So then she's dropped 0.3.0, and that brings it down to about where she was.  So she might have had 16 drinks within two to three hours. 
[00:18:30]  That's a lot of fucking drinking.  And that wasn't even at night.  I think she was just swigging.  Yeah, it was one in the afternoon.  It was one in the afternoon.  So she had to have woken up and just started drinking, basically.  I think she was swigging straight vodka out of the bottle.  While she was driving, too?  Yeah, yeah.  Wow, this is a wonderful person.  That's what they were speculating.  Yeah, wonderful.  And you know what?  Somebody knew something in that family.  Like, oh, boy, here she goes again.  And you know her with her drinking.  How many times were they, you know, crossing their fingers going, well, I hope this works 
[00:19:00]  out okay.  Yeah.  This isn't one of those one and done things.  No way.  Yeah, you don't just on a whim do that.  Hell no.  That is someone that had a major problem that others probably noticed.  Yeah.  Thank you, Charlie, for the math lesson today.  I'm sure they're regretting it now.  No problem.  And you guys are right on about Staten Island.  All right, cool.  Blood alcohol.  You know, speaking of blood alcohol levels, Opie, I was watching a show on, of course, 
[00:19:30]  True TV.  I guess that used to be Court TV, right?  They changed it to True TV, which now never leaves my television set.  It's your favorite channel right now?  It is nothing but police mayhem, the riot shows, Felons Gone Wild, World's Amazing Shootouts.  It's those kind of shows that just, I cannot stop watching them. 
[00:20:00]  The only lame show on there is that stupid Repo show, which isn't real.  Right.  It's just fake.  Just don't even try to tell me it's real.  But most shocking.  I liked watching most shocking.  And there's a show on there where I guess the cops on Lake Havasu out there, because they  do spring break out there, and it's like huge.  And they're on little patrol boats, and they just pull up to boats and arrest people for 
[00:20:30]  being drunk.  Miners, stuff like that.  It is a funny goddamn show.  Why is it funny?  Because there's these intoxicated fucking bitches that don't understand.  And they always say, you had anything to drink?  No, nothing.  Nothing.  I'm going to ask you to blow into this now.  It should read just triple zeros, right?  Triple zero.  Oh, well, I had like a couple of beers a long time ago. 
[00:21:00]  And then they blow like, you know, 0.08 or 0.1.  Blow a nice number.  Or even a 0.06 or 0.05.  And they go, well, you know what the legal limit is for someone your age?  And they go, what?  They go, zero.  You're not supposed to be drinking.  So they cuff this like just hottie in a bikini and shit.  And she's like, oh, then she gets belligerent.  The fuck did I do?  And he grabs her and like slams it down in the chair.  And then there's people driving these boats around. 
[00:21:30]  I guess you could rent these big party boats without even knowing how to drive them.  And there's this one guy driving.  And some chick is like on the front pontoon.  And he doesn't see her.  And he's just starts driving forward.  The cop's like, hey, shut that down.  Because you realize there's someone in front of your boat in the water?  They don't know.  But it's just hysterical how they roust these people.  Is it a party area for the boating?  Huge.  Because some of those party areas are just, they're awesome. 
[00:22:00]  And no one's really like tooling around in their boats.  They're pretty much just, you know.  Yeah, they're kind of tied up.  They're tied up.  And maybe they do a little circle here and there.  But nothing like.  It seems to me like they're giving the people the benefit of the doubt for the just drinking and shit.  But if you do something really fucked up, then they're going to do something.  Gotcha.  Another chick was like lost.  She was just lost.  I can't find my boat.  I can't find.  Could you help me?  She's on the back of some jet ski with some black guy.  And the black guy is like, I'll take it ashore. 
[00:22:30]  And she goes, no, could you please take me?  Like he must have been saying some shit to her.  But I found that to be a pretty goddamn funny show.  What's the name of it?  I'm going to have to check out this true TV.  Yeah.  Because TV is like.  Because when it was.  What is that called, Danny?  Did you see it?  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's like party.  Have a soup party.  Party heat.  Party heat.  It's got to be party.  Party heat.  That sounds like a good show.  That's the one.  Party heat. 
[00:23:00]  Wet, wild and under arrest.  It says.  Oh, there you go.  Under arrest.  Perfect.  How do you not love a show where they say wet, wild and under arrest?  These guys got to love their jobs.  And where is where's where's this body of water?  Arizona.  Little Arizona Lake or something.  Yeah.  Huge Arizona Lake.  And spring break is a huge thing there for people that are out on the west, west coast.  And then they just drag these people on.  They breathalyze them and then they arrest them.  It's hysterical.  It's a scream. 
[00:23:30]  They're pulling these two guys ashore.  One guy is so wasted with like Mardi Gras beads on the back of a jet sheet.  Shows a hoot.  Sit down.  Sit down.  All right.  Yes, sir.  You come back here and sit on that back bench.  I'll deal with you in a minute.  I'll see you right here.  How old are you?  I am 18 years old.  Okay.  So you must have been drinking along with him.  I actually, you know, I had a sip of my friend's beer just briefly.  It wasn't even.  A sip.  Let's see what he blows into the breathalyzer.  Who drinks briefly?  What a sip does. 
[00:24:00]  A sip just briefly.  How old are you legally consumed at 18 years old?  Zero.  That's a good answer.  Generally, I have to kind of work it up a little bit to even make you, or get you into  a DUI situation.  I don't even.  But you're not even old enough to consume alcohol.  And I really wasn't.  They just, I didn't even know it was alcohol.  I was trying this.  It was like a sweetened thing.  It was a sweetened thing.  Now he didn't know it was alcohol.  I didn't know and he just said, try this.  Okay.  And I do.  But this officer hasn't heard this a million times before.  I know, exactly.  Okay, so that's an extremely dumb thing to do, isn't it?  Not only are you doing something incredibly unsafe for my canyon, okay, you're also transporting 
[00:24:30]  a passenger, a 17-year-old, who's under the influence of alcohol himself, with no light  vest on your ski, okay?  All right, I obviously don't have to tell you how to complete this test.  All right, here we go.  Here's a guy that had just a sip.  Yeah, a sip and then a sweet drink.  All right, now he's blowing.  Waiting for the result. 
[00:25:00]  You should have blown zero and you blew above, so you're under arrest for underage drinking.  I haven't been drinking.  I just tried it, sir.  I'm going to be honest.  What would you call it?  I didn't know what was in it, you know?  It's one of those things.  How would you classify drinking then?  Place both your hands up in front of you.  Why don't they tell you the number?  What a bummer.  Usually you can see it, I guess, on the feed here.  You can't really see it.  But there must be a reason they don't announce the number.  They showed it.  Oh, they do?  Yeah, I was watching last night.  They were showing them all.  Yeah, a lot of people saying, I love party heat. 
[00:25:30]  Party heat is great, and they just show hot bitches and then drunk assholes getting arrested.  Is the box set out yet?  It's kind of fun.  I know.  I don't want to get the box out.  It is a funny goddamn show.  What the hell else was last night?  People just diving off of the rocks.  Big rock diving.  Drunk off their ass.  Oh, yeah.  You don't do that sober.  Yeah, and then another guy was so drunk, he's face down on one of these party boats.  Face down.  Not moving. 
[00:26:00]  And everyone's like, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, all dancing around him.  And the cop's like, what's wrong with this guy?  And he can't even get him up.  He's dumping water on him.  He goes, take this.  He goes, is anyone sober here?  Drive this boat back and get this guy, call the fire department.  He's going to die of alcohol poisoning.  And these are the two bitches.  Yeah.  Here's the two bitches.  Are you serious, man?  Oh, my God.  He just, I'm like going to cry.  I just did like all my money on this, dude. 
[00:26:30]  You did?  Yeah.  Oh, what a bad investment.  Have a seat, young lady.  I was trying to drive it, and I was getting really scared because I've never done this.  She said, I ride jet skis.  I've done this before.  And as you can see, she was more confident inside of driving.  She was doing a terrific job.  Two bitches on a jet ski.  It was like a race course.  I just didn't know that we weren't supposed to go.  Can you pause this for a second?  That was awesome.  How does a cop not let the hot babes go?  Dude, this.  For real.  This chick with the sunglasses on.  Yeah, both of them. 
[00:27:00]  Is pretty fucking hot.  Both of them are.  I know the one that might be a little too dark for you.  The one's a little more exotic than my liking.  Nothing wrong with exotic.  But the one on the right is really fucking hot.  She stands up at one point, and you see her bikini bottom and everything.  And this cop kind of manhandles her a little bit, like goon arms her by the life jacket.  I got to think if you're a cop, I'm not talking for the cops, obviously.  But if you're a cop and you're letting a lot of these really hot ones go, come on.  Maybe it's, you know, some of them is catch and release. 
[00:27:30]  Some of you take home with you.  Yeah.  Some are catch and release.  Or safe to say it's really hard to go the distance and arrest them.  Well, you know, also with a camera on you from a TV show.  Well, I'm not even talking about a TV show is different.  He's got to, like, make believe he's not noticing that these two are really hot.  Show me.  Show me how you suck a man's cock.  Yeah, play the rest of that one because it's really great how she.  What a great show.  What is it called again? 
[00:28:00]  Party Heat.  Party Heat.  Wet, wild, and under arrest.  Wet, wild, and under arrest.  Nice.  Do you drink any alcohol today?  I love it.  No.  Are you sure?  So when I test you, you're going to be absolutely fine.  Yeah.  Are you being honest?  How am I going to get tested, though?  Now's the time to be honest.  Okay, I had, like, one or two beers, but I didn't even pass the legal limit or anything.  What is the legal limit for somebody under 21?  It's not a barrel.  And why is that?  Because you're not allowed to drink when you're under 21.  It's because you're not old enough.  Exactly. 
[00:28:30]  You passed one test, at least, so far.  Oh, what a smart answer, this guy is.  Where did you get the beer from?  I don't know.  I mean, around.  I don't know.  What's around?  You found it in the sand.  You took it out of somebody's cooler.  You were drinking with guys.  I found it in the sand.  You found it in the sand?  I found it in the sand.  That's what you're really going to stick with?  That's what you're really going to stick with, is that?  For the record, the exotic one.  It's hotter.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, yeah, well, that's going to happen.  Body-wise, I like the other one.  Because you are under the age of 21, okay, and you are not even old enough to consume 
[00:29:00]  alcohol, okay, the burden of proof with me is not to go through a series of field sobriety  tests with you, because they're not required, because you're not old enough to consume alcohol.  Just blow steady, okay, until I tell you to stop.  Go.  Blow.  Keep blowing.  Keep going.  Throw harder.  Our friend's like, oh, this ain't going to work out.  Yeah, this ain't good.  She's looking away, knowing that this is bad.  Where's your dad? 
[00:29:30]  He's at home.  He gave me full permission to go.  0.06 on the pass.  0.06.  0.06.  I'm 18 years old.  I'm not a little girl.  Her big sister.  Well, I mean, I'm sorry.  I'm not trying to be.  Really?  Okay, well, you know what?  You are a big girl.  You are a big girl, okay?  And I'm going to show you what happens to big girls when they make mistakes.  Stand up.  What did I say?  Stand up.  Every f***ing time.  Put your hands behind the back.  You're under arrest for minor consumption of alcohol.  Look at that.  His lap is big girls when they make mistakes, so you're a big girl. 
[00:30:00]  All right, dude.  Now she's going with the dude.  Dude, now watch how he manhandles her.  He's nice and drunk.  That's why.  I'm not drunk, dude.  What the f***?  I had two f***ing beers.  Okay, great.  You're not old enough to drink.  Don't f***ing like that.  He's grossed her in the seat.  You will learn a great lesson in this, young lady.  Aw.  Please get down.  Okay, young lady.  I hope that you do not consume any alcohol.  No.  They're not going to learn a lesson.  Come on.  No.  They're teenagers doing what they should be doing. 
[00:30:30]  Having a few beers and drinks.  Hey, you didn't know that you couldn't consume alcohol as a minor?  No.  Obviously, I knew that you can.  That's why I said I will leave this.  I will leave this.  It's my fault.  Now they're just both baffling.  They're just like, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.  And I want you to blow on this machine the same way she did.  Am I going to jail regardless, sir?  Take a deep breath.  Can you let me know?  Take a breath and blow on this thing.  Can you please let me know, sir?  She wants to pass.  No, sir.  Then you might want to blow on this.  What did I do?  Why do I get handcuffed?  That's not the way it goes.  What happened?  Okay, you're going to blow long and steady until I tell you to stop. 
[00:31:00]  You understand?  Don't wrap your mouth all the way around it.  Blow on the end of it.  Go.  Keep blowing.  Keep blowing.  Keep going.  How hard was that?  You could Photoshop that nice, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Like, this is not fair.  Okay, you're an 057.  You're receiving a citation for minor in consumption of alcohol.  This isn't a DUI.  You weren't driving the ski.  No, sir.  Okay, Mario Andretti was driving the ski, and we're going to deal with her separately.  Hi. 
[00:31:30]  Jesus.  These kids come out here for spring break.  They just throw all caution to the wind.  They don't even see any problem with what they're doing.  She doesn't get it.  She flat out doesn't get it.  She needs jail, and she's heading for it.  All right, he's being dramatic.  He is being dramatic.  They don't get it.  It's not like they're completely ripped.  Yeah.  0.60 on spring break?  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, but the thing is, you're not minors.  That's like having your morning coffee.  They're minors.  Yeah, but they didn't look wasted.  They had a few beers. 
[00:32:00]  I know.  But he's making it sound like, oh, they really need to learn their lesson.  Well, here's what happens to a big girl.  You need to learn a lesson.  They're just teenagers.  The cuffs go on.  Doing the spring break thing.  The cuffs go on, and he manhandled her into the seat.  It's a great clip.  Danny is laughing.  He really did just grab her and throw her in the chair.  But it wasn't like they were recklessly tooling around on the jet ski,  and it wasn't like they were completely wasted.  I understand the law is the law.  I think you're glossing over that my favorite part of that clip  was when he puts the cuffs on her, and she goes, 
[00:32:30]  you know what the fuck?  I'm always getting put in the handcuffs.  Oh, she said that?  All right, well, I didn't hear that part.  She's trouble, that girl.  Is she?  Yeah, she's trouble.  She's the furthest from trouble.  That's great.  Party Heat, True TV, way to go, Ann.  I'm going to be checking that one out.  Yeah, I like that show.  Absolutely.  Yeah, and it was smart on their part to change.  Court TV, I always flip by Court TV.  I'm like, who's going to be bothered?  Yeah, yeah.  Unless you see some kind of cool thing that catches your eye, maybe.  But in general, you're not stopping on Court TV. 
[00:33:00]  I fell asleep watching a trial on there yesterday.  Some guy shot his father.  Yeah.  And, you know, it was pretty cool.  Interesting enough to fall asleep to.  Sure.  Hey, was that Lake Havris?  Or Havasu, or something like that?  Yeah, Lake Havasu, right?  Yeah.  Was that?  Really?  Skip the Trucker has a little knowledge on Lake Havasu.  Is it Havasu, Skip?  Yes, it is.  Okay, what do you got on that?  I believe that's the same lake that the Pam and Tommy Lee porno video was made on. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, that might be.  Really?  That might have been Lake Havasu.  Pretty sure.  Yeah.  Oh, by the way, good evening.  Good evening.  You guys have a good one.  Punch it out.  Am I messing up the decimals, too?  She blew a what?  0.060?  0.06.  Yeah.  0.06.  Okay.  Yeah, 0.06.  I do make that mistake a lot.  It's always laughing at me, because 0.60 is just ridiculous. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, 0.60 would be, wow.  All right, I gotcha.  That's like dead.  And the legal limit in New York is 0.09 or 0.08?  0.08.  They lowered it.  Yep.  Damn.  0.08.  It used to be fucking 0.1.  0.1.  Look at you getting mad.  It's ridiculous.  I've always said they should have a driver's test for drunk.  So you get a drunk driver's license, and then you drink, you take a test, you pay for  it, and then you drive a course, and you drink a little more, and then you're rated as to what 
[00:34:30]  your blood alcohol level is when you can still function.  Yeah.  And that way, you know, you get pulled over, you blow a 0.08, and then the cop looks at  your license and goes, okay, well, you're rated for, you know, 0.09 or 0.1, so you're  free to go.  That would never fly, Anthony.  If I was a politician.  I was going to say, what politician is going to take that one on?  Who's going to go, Chuck Schumer?  I doubt it. 
[00:35:00]  Damn, the phones.  You got Sean in Georgia.  We'll try to do a speed round with this topic.  Sean, what do you got?  That cop's an ass.  He even said it when he was given the DUI that usually I have to work it up to be able  to give you a DUI.  Yeah.  Well, he's just...  He shouldn't be doing all this, given some of the tickets he's giving.  He's just being an ass to make money for the county.  You know what it is?  He's probably done this a thousand times a day.  It's the same dumb stories from the same dumb drunks. 
[00:35:30]  So, you know, and they're just showing the ones that he's taken in.  He probably lets a bunch of them go.  I mean, it would be...  You know what that show would be like if they showed everyone he even stopped?  You know what?  106 for a small girl is what?  Two or three beers a thousand?  But she's not supposed to be drinking at all.  Yeah.  You don't brag about your drinking and driving over the weekend.  I don't brag about drinking and driving.  I see a hypocrite, though.  Never brag about that.  I see a hypocrite.  You're trying to say you don't want young girls drinking, Anthony? 
[00:36:00]  No, look.  There's nothing I enjoy more than drunken teen girls.  Believe me.  But I'm saying if the cop is there, there's no argument.  You can't argue or call him an asshole or anything else because that's his job.  Your job is to avoid that situation.  To evade.  His job is to catch you.  The cops happen to stop by one of your parties and just come on in and check and see that  there are underage drunk girls. 
[00:36:30]  The cop's not coming into my house and checking fucking blood alcohol levels on...  Yeah, because they already live there.  Shit like that.  They're stopping by to just hang.  Because they already live there.  No.  They already got a room in your house.  It's like blaming with the little ghosty things for getting your Pac-Man, dude.  You gotta evade, evade, evade.  And also, water cops aren't jackasses, anyway.  Are they?  All right, Sean.  He doesn't like the water cops.  Well, because you're just...  You're not doing much, usually. 
[00:37:00]  Do you know what they're dealing with on a daily basis?  Look, they have to make good TV, and that guy has to play it to the limit.  But I need a follow-up if we can find it.  I guarantee both those girls completely were let go after the show was done filming.  Well, no.  They probably got arrested.  Or maybe they have to arrest them because now it's on film.  Yeah, they give them some kind of a desk appearance ticket or some crap, I'm sure.  Yeah, I guess they wouldn't be able to let them go if it's a TV show.  They take them somewhere, make them fill out some paperwork, shit like that. 
[00:37:30]  Maybe post some bail or their own recognizance, and then they're gone.  Back to partying.  Back to spreading them fucking gams and getting a nice spring break fucking.  Remember I said, you know, it's gotta be tough for a cop.  You gotta think some of these cops are letting the hot babes go.  Yeah.  We got Eric in New York.  You might have a comment or two on this.  Eric.  Hey, guys.  Hey, man.  My biggest thing is when you stop a chick and she's really smoking hot and she knows it and she's a douchebag, 
[00:38:00]  she goes, officer, I thought you'd only pretty girl's tickets.  I said, I don't.  Here's your ticket.  Oh, I see.  So you go the other way.  So, but there's a couple things going on here with Eric.  Like, there are a lot of girls out there that know that some cops might show a little weakness because they are hot.  But then in that case, as the hot girl, you can't, you gotta like still act clueless and just let your hotness speak for itself instead of acknowledging that you are indeed hot. 
[00:38:30]  Exactly.  Yeah.  Don't be a douchebag about it.  You're gonna get a pass.  Believe me.  Yeah.  So is that true?  There's cops out there letting the hot babes go?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Oh, by the way, someone said it's Lake Mead.  Lake Mead?  That was the Tommy and Pam thing.  Lake Mead.  Travis is saying the Bill Hicks bit is about five minutes long.  You know what?  Really?  Five minutes of Bill Hicks goes by like it's nothing, my friend. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, it certainly does.  Like it's nothing.  Because you got a whole pot alcohol thing that he summarizes very nicely in this bit.  Yeah.  I think we could play that.  But someone, Danny said, someone used to get pulled over about every two weeks and never  got a ticket.  That's right.  Did she?  Not once.  Not one ticket.  Nope.  Pulled over.  Speeding tickets.  Well, what should have been a speeding ticket.  I wonder what.  Probably twice a month.  Really?  Yeah.  But you know someone that's pretty good looking and gets pulled over a lot and never really. 
[00:39:30]  And what was that?  Just the smile and the, oh, I don't know what I'm doing.  I'm sorry.  Oh, look at me.  Don't you know me?  I'm on Pal Talk.  You don't want it?  What the hell?  God bless you if you could get away with that.  Some of us have to work a little harder.  I'm pulling out PBA cards like I'm playing poker.  What county am I in?  Who are you?  Where are you from?  I need this.  I'm tired.  I'm tired. 
[00:40:00]  Got arrested for a .08 while looking at my house.  My bachelor party.  I blew a .21.  Lost six hours and woke up in hospital.  And that was at a .21.  And what did that woman, she was at a .19?  .19.  Yeah.  Let me say hi to Tom in Jersey.  Tom, what's up?  Hey.  Good morning, boys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Yeah.  My bachelor party.  We were drinking and imbibing a little herb. 
[00:40:30]  And about 9 o'clock at night, I lost consciousness.  3 in the morning, I woke up in the hospital.  Yeah.  All right, so you didn't add much to what I said about your phone call.  All right, Tom.  Thank you, sir.  We're going to take a break with the Bill Hicks bit.  Danny's turning me on to Super Douche Biker Fight Speeding Ticket from the show Speed,  which is also on True TV, right?  Yeah.  It's just like a traffic courtroom show where you get a speeding ticket or some kind of traffic violation, 
[00:41:00]  and you can go, and it's kind of like People's Court or whatever.  And now they go and fight the ticket on television.  There's something like that.  And there's also another show that's made by the same people that make cops,  and it's like what happens after they're arrested and they end up in county jail,  like waiting to be processed and stuff.  Oh, that's probably good.  And that's pretty funny because some of the people are so drunk and belligerent,  they have to be put in, like, Hannibal Lecter things and they tie them down.  On TLC, they got a new show called Police Women of Broward County. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I didn't see it yet, but like—  The blonde looks kind of hot.  Yeah, a couple of them are kind of cute.  There's like four police women, and they follow them around like cops.  Yeah, a couple of them are kind of cute, man.  The blonde that goes like, there's never a bad time to use a taser.  I don't think it's premiered yet, but it looks like it's been a good point.  Yeah, yeah, that one.  I might have to catch that one.  I love those goddamn shows.  That sounds really good.  And CNN doing a thing on the Obama poster saying, Obama poster, no joke. 
[00:42:00]  It's the—  It's no joke about it.  It's basically they put Obama in the Heath Ledger Joker makeup.  Joker makeup.  And the posters are being popped up all over the place.  So why does it say no joke?  George Bush was made like—they made him as Hitler.  Right.  And put him up all over the place.  Well, the poster is Obama in the Heath Ledger Joker makeup, and then it says socialism.  So maybe the boys down the hall could get us a couple clips of this from CNN.  But it said—what is her name?  Julie Mos? 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Ugh.  CNN.  She does the fun pieces for CNN.  The human interest fun.  We're having just a little fun with this.  Yeah.  She's the worst.  That's that one of the chicks from that Broward County.  Holy shit.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, she's pretty hot, that one.  Wow, that's fucked up.  You'd just be like, okay.  There was no joke, too.  I saw in the promo, one of the policewomen just rips somebody off of a bicycle and just slams them into the floor.  I was like, holy shit.  Yeah, they have to be like really—they've got to be kind of twice. 
[00:43:00]  This is tough.  But I saw this one where there was this clip of a woman, policewoman, and she's taking this pretty big black guy out of the car.  And she had her taser out.  And the black guy just kind of knocks her down, grabs the taser, and tases her.  Damn.  And then backup showed up and really fucked up his world.  That rocks.  But yeah, there's certain things that are just, you know, just strength-wise, eh, you need a little backup. 
[00:43:30]  It's more than strength, though.  Remember when the female cops cuffed us.  Yeah.  They just know how to kind of use leverage and stuff.  Yeah, you've got to twist the guy up.  They know how to twist you into some positions.  Let's take our first break.  You've got Obama talking about health care.  We've got—wow, breaking news.  Someone has quit.  Someone has quit.  What?  That's all I'm saying.  That's your tease.  What?  We'll tell you after the break.  Someone has quit.  And there was something really good I wanted to tease. 
[00:44:00]  Ah, fuck.  I don't know.  Oh, I think we should talk about the Clinton thing a little bit.  Oh, absolutely.  The Bill Clinton thing.  He got something done that was pretty damn impressive.  Yeah, wow.  We'll talk about that as well.  But first, Bill Hicks talking about alcohol and pot.  I think it's worth it, even though it's five minutes.  Bill Hicks is just fucking—was a brilliant comic.  Bill Hicks is dead.  That's why I said was.  Brilliant comic and social commentator. 
[00:44:30]  Ah, yes.  And his stuff is still relevant today, even though he's been gone for, I don't know, like over 10 years now.  He's dead.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Opie and Anthony, hey, we got a update on the Tiger Woods fart. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, my God.  Fart gate.  Fart gate.  Remember when everything was gate?  They had to put gate at the end of it.  Of everything.  That finally died down, boy, not even all that long ago.  For real?  Yeah, remember?  Because Clinton was involved with something gate.  What was the last gate?  Before they said enough with the gate thing.  I think Clinton had— 
[00:45:30]  Water gate.  You got water gate, cigar gate, white water.  Oh, yeah.  No, travel gate was one.  Travel gate.  Yeah.  Yeah, they just put gate at the end.  That's so stupid.  Which makes no sense, really.  Now, I was confused—  We're bringing it back, though, with fart gate.  Yeah, fart gate.  I was confused when the whole Tiger Woods fart thing came about, because I was watching,  because I'm a big golf fan, especially if Tiger's playing.  And when the whole fart went down, him and his caddy looked over to the gallery. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  So I said, in my mind, no, Tiger did not fart.  It was someone in the gallery that farted, and they reacted to that, going, you've got  to be kidding me.  And they're laughing, like anyone should do when they hear a fart.  Yeah.  Fart equals funny, right?  Of course.  Then it came out, like, Monday, I guess, that Tiger Woods farted.  I'm like, what?  And then we looked at the video yesterday, I guess, and he kind of was moving his leg a  little bit, so now it's starting to get confused.  Wait, did Tiger Woods really fart? 
[00:46:30]  Well, now they're saying that it was David Faraday?  David Faraday, who's a great golf analyst.  Oh, a golf analyst.  Yeah, who was following Tiger.  So he was kind of on the, by the gallery?  Yeah, he had his mic on, waiting for Tiger to hit a shot, and then, of course, he's going  to talk about the shot after Tiger hits the ball.  And, of course, the mic picked up the fart.  Now, how did Tiger and his caddy hear it?  Because I think Faraday, he's got to be. 
[00:47:00]  He's, like, right there?  Yeah, like 10 yards away, tops.  He's right, right off to the side.  And let it release a little bit more.  Tiger waits.  It's interesting that all three of his 0-9 wins.  So they're basically now saying that it was him and not Tiger Woods that farted.  And Travis was telling me this morning, there's a better video of it, where you actually hear 
[00:47:30]  Tiger say, what?  Are you kidding me?  Or something like that?  Really?  Yeah.  Where's that video?  I'm looking for it right now.  Hang on one second.  That's a good one.  They're calling him a golf anal-ist.  No, they're not.  Jim Bagg from Florida.  Yeah, there's another video of Tiger farting.  A bunch of people are saying.  All right, if you're fine or whatever.  But we got breaking news.  Someone has quit. 
[00:48:00]  Someone has quit.  Quit.  Quit.  We're not going to let you hang around any longer without knowing.  Someone has quit.  You got the Tiger thing first?  I think so.  All right, hold on, man.  There we go.  Here we go.  All right, it wasn't Tiger. 
[00:48:30]  It's obvious.  No, no, no.  This angle, because Tiger looks over to the sideline and goes, are you serious?  All right, that's pretty fucking funny.  All right.  Fartgate is officially over.  Tiger wants to not fart.  It's been exonerated.  This is who quit.  Paula Abdul making it official she will not return to American Idol.  The singer sent out a Twitter message late last night saying she has decided not to return.  Abdul has been a judge on that show, you know, for eight seasons now. 
[00:49:00]  Officials for American Idol say she has been an important part of the show,  and they're sad she's not coming back.  The announcement came a day after Cara Diaguardi signed on to judge another season.  The next season of American Idol kicks off in January of next year.  Okay, stupid media.  You got everything right in front of you.  That is, why, why isn't anyone talking about it?  And she goes, you're fired.  Yeah.  She goes, this comes a day after the other broad, Karen, whatever her last name is. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  Signed on for another season of Idol.  So, okay, stupid media.  You like commenting about everything all the time.  And why don't you say what really happened?  You're fired.  Paula Abdul was given the option to say that she quit.  Yeah, yeah.  They were not renewing Paula Abdul's contract.  They bring her into the little American Idol office.  They go, hi, Paula.  Take a seat.  I've got to talk to you about this. 
[00:50:00]  Look, we're not renewing your contract.  Right.  For next season.  Right.  Which means you're fired.  Yeah.  So, let's just explain a few options we have here.  We don't want this to affect you adversely.  So, we have a press release already written here that says that you are leaving the show.  Mm-hmm.  You can read it.  Mm-hmm.  This is what will go out.  Mm-hmm.  And goodbye. 
[00:50:30]  Or you could go into the press and we'll say that we fired you for, you know, the pills and she was a little unstable and this, that, the other.  So, you pick.  Right.  And she goes, okay, well, that's what it is.  We're known as dopey shock jocks and we're telling you the truth.  Why can't the media do this?  That happens.  That's how it fucking happens.  And this happens all the time.  So, why can't somebody just explain this is what they do?  They give you the option.  They obviously had no intention of continuing with Paul Abdul. 
[00:51:00]  No.  Especially when they brought the fourth judge on last year.  Yeah.  That was to make everyone comfortable with the decision they were going to make.  And now they got a year under their belt with the new woman.  So, people are used to her.  They're now used to her.  Instead of like, whoa, what's this?  This is weird.  This is not what I'm used to.  And then Paula goes away and you're back to three judges, which it was supposed to be.  Because you need, you know, two and then a tiebreaker kind of a judge.  What the fuck is that?  Mm-hmm.  So, now, bye-bye. 
[00:51:30]  Were you watching Idol when they had two Ryan Seacrests?  Does anyone remember they used to have two Ryan Seacrests?  That was like first season, right?  Right.  Who's that guy?  It's like, goddamn.  That would have been the best gig ever.  Yeah, that guy ended up on one of those horrendous celeb reality shows.  Did he?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, bye-bye.  So, Paula Abdul, uh...  She'd go back to her singing career.  Well, you don't even have to call it a firing.  She was let go.  Let go.  It wasn't her decision. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, she really is going to give up a multi-million dollar gig.  Yeah, yeah.  That gives her, like, great exposure.  For all the other things that I'm sure that people are clamoring for as far as she goes.  Mm-hmm.  Like, what else do you think Paula Abdul has going that she can just kind of leave American Idol to move on to that?  Right.  Nothing.  And all the facts are there, but no one, no one...  No one will say it.  ...in mainstream media will sit down and explain this to you.  No one will say anything. 
[00:52:30]  Uh, let's say hi to Dave in New Hampshire.  Dave.  Hey, Dave.  Morning, boys.  Hey, Dave.  The last gate was the Patriots camera scandal.  Spygate.  Spygate.  Spygate.  Was that the actual last gate?  Stargate.  Then Stargate SGI.  I think that was the last gate.  That's a different gate, Anthony.  Oh, I thought you included TV shows.  Yeah, that's different.  Heaven's Gate?  That's different.  Should we Google bomb Paul Abdul was fired? 
[00:53:00]  That's a boring one, though.  Yeah.  We only Google bomb good stuff.  We need fun ones.  Yeah, fun ones.  Bill in the OC.  Hello, Bill.  Morning, guys.  How you doing today?  All right.  Uh, Stargate SGI up in Alaska had Troopergate, so the gate is definitely out there.  Oh, that's right.  Troopergate.  Yeah, that gate thing has just been put into, uh, vernacular.  Yeah, we love throwing gate at the end of it.  And, um, yeah, what did they just recently sell to Watergate Hotel, I think? 
[00:53:30]  Did they?  Didn't they rename it?  Like, it hasn't been Watergate in a while.  We stayed there.  That was cool.  We were in D.C.  I gotta admit, that was fucking cool when we got to stay.  They stayed at the Watergate Hotel.  That was all right, man.  Yeah, but they had changed it to something else.  I don't remember.  Nah, I don't either.  Somebody will let us know.  Um.  No buyer for Watergate at auction, huh?  This Nick Cannon NAS video is getting major exposure, and I don't know what it means, what  they're trying to accomplish.  You want to do this or the, uh, Bill Clinton thing? 
[00:54:00]  Uh, let's do this, because I have no clue what this is.  All right, and then we'll seg into what Bill Clinton got done.  Basically, he's a modern-day superhero, this Bill Clinton.  Just amazing.  Doing everyone's job, by the way.  I think he did his wife's job and the president's job.  The president's job, his wife's job.  Right.  The Obama administration, uh, for some reason, couldn't, uh, you know, pull this off.  Well, why don't we seg into that?  So, you got the two journalists that were a little too close to the border.  Hang Fang and Sang Chang.  I have no idea what their names were. 
[00:54:30]  Well, it was the one broad sister that used to be on The View.  Is that really?  Yeah, I know that much.  Really?  Yeah.  Ling?  It was Lisa Ling's sister?  Lisa Ling's sister is a journalist.  She got a little too close to the border, and they said, uh-uh, you're ours now.  Yeah, yeah, they came into North Korea, or close enough, and they snatched him up, gave  him, uh, some prison sentences.  Hard labor.  Of hard labor, which has got to be lovely over there in, uh, North Korea.  Wow.  You think their hard labor's worse than our hard labor? 
[00:55:00]  Oh, yeah.  I don't think there's any, um, Amnesty International groups saying, hey, stop.  Stop that.  You see this big rock?  Yeah.  Take this big malady thing and break it into powder.  We'll check back in 10 years to see how you're doing.  And there's no reason for you to do this.  Is that what hard labor is?  Yeah.  I try to imagine what hard labor is, because, you know, it doesn't mean anything for anyone  else.  No.  It's just to make your life a complete nightmare.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like hell. 
[00:55:30]  Because, you know, you just do something, because it sucks.  Because I think if you were sentenced to hard labor, but you were maybe getting something  accomplished with your hard labor, maybe in some way you could live with yourself at  that point.  Like, okay, what a major fucking hassle.  But I just built, like, a highway, a hundred mile highway by myself.  Well, watch Bridge Over the River Kwai.  You'll see a bunch of the, uh, uh, soldiers, the prisoners of war, prisoners of Japan, uh,  taking pride, actually, in building a bridge that, that, uh, turned out to be, you know,  a little detrimental to, uh, to our guys, or would have been if it wasn't going up. 
[00:56:00]  But at least you know your energy and your hard work is going towards something.  So, so in your mind, that, you know, because you're occupying a lot of time, you're like,  okay, well.  Yeah.  But when they give you a hard labor where you're just smashing rocks and it means  nothing, that's got to be fucking hell on earth.  You just know you're getting nothing accomplished.  They could give a shit what you're doing.  They just want to, want to beat the crap out of you physically, mentally.  That's it.  So, these two seem like a goner. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  Uh, Lisa Liu or Lang or whatever her name is.  Lisa Lang.  Lisa Lang was all over CNN begging, you know, we, I want my sister to come home.  And, you know, they weren't listening to what we were saying.  Nope.  And then Bill Clinton gets involved and goes over there and picks up the two broads.  Gets them pardoned.  You think?  Uh, by, uh, Kim Jong-il himself.  And there's a picture of, uh, Bill Clinton sitting down with him.  Sitting next to him.  It just looks, they look so uncomfortable sitting next to each other.  A little, a little Kim Jong-il and giant Bill Clinton. 
[00:57:00]  And Nate and I were talking about this during the break.  Could you imagine being that powerful?  Like a Bill Clinton where you know you have, you know, the U.S. military backing you.  So if, if this.  You better hope so, right?  Yeah, but if this guy gets crazy and decides, well, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to kidnap an ex-president.  You're not leave.  You're not leave now.  Wait a minute.  I'm Bill Clinton.  I, I, I, I get the fuck out of here.  Can you imagine having that much power on this earth where you know you could go into one of the most dangerous places on earth right now and, and, and know that you're coming back home? 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, if, if, if they decided to take a former president hostage, wow.  You think that would be bad?  Well, Obama would probably make a speech about it and say how we have to be tolerant.  And we're doing everything possible.  Yeah, we're doing everything possible.  I love the, I love the, we're doing everything possible speech that you get every once in a while from these idiots.  Yeah, I love the, the, the, the fact that, hey, isn't the Clinton with the vagina supposed to be there? 
[00:58:00]  Isn't the Clinton with the fat ankles and the vagina supposed to be doing that instead of Bill Clinton?  And how bad does Bill want to be away from Hillary that he's now hanging out in North Korea?  Look, I want to go to Somalia and fight pirates.  I don't care.  I just can't, keep me away from this fucking bitch.  Keep me away from this bitch.  That's a long plane ride home.  You think Bill's like, all right, I, I did you a favor.  Now you got to do me a little favor. 
[00:58:30]  You know what the Yankee cranky is, right?  You got to do me a little favor.  Oh, you're doing that?  Yeah, I got you out.  Show me how you suck a man's cock.  Yankee cranky.  You want to work the sushi place or the nail joint when you get back?  Yankee cranky.  And this wasn't President Obama.  Obama, he had nothing to do with this, right?  No, he barely talked about it.  They said that when Bill Clinton was over there, he did not talk to Obama at all.  No.  During this exchange. 
[00:59:00]  This was, now, I don't know, the only, here's the only thing I will even give to Obama on this one.  Perhaps they didn't want it to look like they were negotiating with a lunatic terrorist country.  Sure.  Or, you know, an axis of evil country.  Although he, you know, doesn't call anybody that.  They're all wonderful people that we need to coddle and hold.  Right.  But, uh, he, he should have been involved in this. 
[00:59:30]  And just, just like, uh, the, the soldier that's, uh, being held hostage in, uh, Afghanistan.  Where's that guy?  Where's that guy?  Where's, uh, you know, Obama talking about that?  And I think.  Once his head rolls out on a fucking videotape, then we'll talk about him?  And you know what?  I don't even have to say, I think.  That guy?  Way more important than, than a couple of dopey journalists that got too close to a border.  I think you're right.  So, you know, let's get that guy home.  Yep.  Well.  Our priorities in this country are all fucked up. 
[01:00:00]  Obama is really, um.  A great president?  No.  No.  Uh, you look at his popularity.  Wow.  Well, I think so.  Right?  He shoots some hoops, doesn't he?  Yeah, the popularity's, uh, dropping.  Popularity is, um, eh.  Because, he just, I, you know what it is?  He, he's doing with the economy what Bush did with the war.  Like, a president has to be multifaceted. 
[01:00:30]  You know what I mean?  A president has to be able to handle a lot of shit.  Uh, the economy.  And we have a war going on.  And there's hostage situations.  And there's little things that happen in the world and in our country.  You gotta, like, be able to, you know, spin those plates.  Juggle a little bit.  This guy, you know, George Bush was all about, you know, terror, terror, war, terror, terror,  war on terror, terror.  And nothing else got done.  Mm-hmm.  And this guy is, is economy, economy, economy, healthcare, economy and healthcare. 
[01:01:00]  And, and, and that's it.  So, maybe we should put the two presidents together.  You got some Bush in my Obama.  You got Obama in my Bush.  Yeah.  We're being called idiots.  And, of course, every time we are.  And we know we're idiots.  But this guy is screaming, uh, idiots.  Pre-arranged by North Korea as photo op for Kim Jong-il.  He calls him Kim Jong-yang-tong-dong. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  You fucking idiots.  Like, Clinton would go if he didn't know he'd get them.  Well, yeah.  That was pretty obvious.  But that was a range where there's some conversations going and Bill goes, look, if I go over there,  you're going to release these people, right?  Yeah.  And they go, yeah, okay, we'll do that.  Yeah.  And then Bill goes, all right, I'm going over there.  We know that Bill Clinton didn't go over there wondering if he actually was going to be able  to come back with them.  Yeah, before we went on the air.  Before we even went on the air, I mean, you know, people were talking about this.  And the fact that he even went over there, we know this was Kim Jong-il going, look, I'm 
[01:02:00]  going to make America look a little silly.  I'm going to get, uh, one of the dignitaries over here, which is Clinton.  And I want an apology, which he got.  Um, but the fact that, uh, that, that Obama or Hillary really had nothing to do with this  is, it's kind of like, that's your fucking job to, to deal with, um, other countries.  And, and, and, and let's break it down.  Bill Clinton went over there to bring back like two panda bears. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  We all love panda bears.  Oh, you got to bring the cute girls back to the United States.  Of course.  If they were like two gnarly, I don't know, badgers with backpacks somewhere else.  Were they, were they cute at all?  You know, they're a little, two relatively cute Asian girls.  Yeah.  Harmless.  Nice.  Yeah.  Negotiating.  Yeah.  I understand that Obama doesn't want to look like he's negotiating with anybody, but I  mean, he hasn't said a word about it. 
[01:03:00]  No.  And then why are more people dying in Afghanistan?  Why are more of our, of our soldiers being killed over there?  Because we don't have a president that really is, is very good at, at striking back.  My theory?  Yeah.  Getting closer to the man.  You think?  We're pushing forward.  I don't know about that.  So the fighting's getting a little earlier.  Dude, I don't, I don't think so.  I think we're getting a little closer to the Osama.  I think, uh, we have a commander in chief there that, uh, doesn't really like to push. 
[01:03:30]  I don't know.  Who knows?  That's just my, that's my opinion based on what I read.  Let's just go get high.  Hey, we, we got the, we got the Google bomb.  I want to thank Ronnie.  Oh.  Here is your Google bomb of the day.  Listen closely.  Paul Abdul quits idle due to impacted colon.  That's a long one, man. 
[01:04:00]  That's why I said, listen closely.  That's a long one.  Concentrate.  Once again, Paul Abdul quits idle due to impacted colon.  That, that is funny.  Are they getting it down there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cause that's, that's, that's the epicenter of the Google bomb right there.  You're looking at Google bomb Abdul, Paul Abdul.  Sorry.  Paul Abdul.  Let's not get confused.  Paul Abdul quits idle due to impacted colon. 
[01:04:30]  Impacted colon.  All right.  Yeah.  So that's all we got on the Clinton thing, but that's, uh, that's pretty impressive for  Bill, for his resume.  He's going to get a nice gig now.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Ambassador.  Yeah.  Future employers are going to be impressed with the fact that he went over to North Korea  and brought, brought two journalists home.  Yeah.  Wow.  He's going to be the ambassador of staying half a world away from his wife.  That's what he went.  Where is she? 
[01:05:00]  Uh, could you send me halfway around?  I need to be 12,000 miles away in any direction.  Man.  She's just, she's just, she just went away.  She completely disappeared as secretary of state.  You know, Condoleezza Rice was, uh, always in the news.  She, she'd go places, but she would then talk about it, say what's going on.  This one, Hillary goes places and then you're just like, what the fuck?  We're committed to Africa's future. 
[01:05:30]  Why?  Because they're hurting.  Is that what she did?  Because they're hurting.  Is that where she's been?  Yeah.  She's on a little like 10 day African trip.  Something like that.  Can we just fucking give up on Africa?  Can we just do it?  Please.  Can we just stop sending money and give up and wait until nature takes its fucking course?  Why?  Because it's a fucking Petri dish over there.  We're human beings.  We got to save everything.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Isn't that great?  Instead of acknowledging that nature needs to do its thing. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got to acknowledge that nature has to do its thing to keep everybody healthy.  Is there a way, is she tapping every male on the shoulder saying, no, you can't cure AIDS by fucking a virgin?  Or is she saying, could you not take that spade shovel and dig out little girls' clitorises?  They do it with spade shovels?  Whatever they use.  It's horrible.  Do you think they got a little tool just for that?  Just for that.  The clit removal tool? 
[01:06:30]  And then there was another show I was watching that I was just kind of stunned.  They're taking these girls because they know that rape is so prevalent in a lot of African nations.  Because they do believe that if you have AIDS, it will be cured if you fuck a virgin.  Nice.  This is not fairy tale.  This is what they believe.  So they're taking these girls and making them not look old enough to have sex with by, they showed this woman, this mother, in some kind of fucking tent with some hot stick that she put in a fire. 
[01:07:00]  And she's rolling it around on her daughter's budding breasts to shrink them.  Get the fuck out of here.  Do you think I will?  All right.  I'm getting the fuck out of here.  But now you know what I just said.  Are you serious?  No shit.  How are you?  They are doing that so that the girl can now walk around and not look old enough to fuck. 
[01:07:30]  But like the word's not getting out that that's being done.  I know.  But when you see her walking around with smoldering tits.  You just don't want anything to do with it anyway.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're thinking, wow, I thought AIDS was bad.  But what gave that girl smoldering tits?  Wow, smoldering tit disease.  Holy shit.  Yeah, it's just, it's worthless.  How long have we been trying to take care of Africa?  To take care of the AIDS problem in Africa, which has done nothing but grow. 
[01:08:00]  Education.  Stopping these warlords from just genocide on massive scales between nations where there's a border and no difference between the people.  But you've got to kill that entire group of people.  And they do it in horrifically horrible machetes and those goddamn, wow, when they used to, when Winnie Mandela used to take the tire full of gasoline and light it on fire around someone's neck. 
[01:08:30]  Back in the street.  Yeah.  She was a real treat.  That Winnie.  That's just horrendous.  I think we were better off before the internet.  Yeah.  Because there was a time where you just didn't know what was going on over there.  You kind of got an idea through National Geographic.  I think we did the bit where, imagine.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  They're eating fucking.  What are they eating?  Chinch bugs or maggots or something.  This guy has a bone through his nose.  Yeah.  There are people living. 
[01:09:00]  Dude, we fly.  We fly.  We fly.  And what do they do?  They eat bugs.  They eat bugs and put bones through their nose.  We're close.  There's no reason.  And they put the big carrot stick on their penises.  Yeah, they put big carrot sticks on their penises and they shoot monkeys with blowguns and eat them.  There is no reason in 2009 that any civilization or any peoples on this planet should act this way.  Look at this. 
[01:09:30]  Look at this.  What the fuck is this?  They're just dancing.  They're happy.  They're dancing.  They all have spears.  They're getting psyched for the big kill.  Are they?  Yes.  They have the necklaces and bones through their nose and the big weenie rod things.  I don't understand how this still happens.  What makes me laugh really hard when I see these type of shows is the middle-aged white man that goes there and then dresses like them and tries to assimilate into the culture. 
[01:10:00]  He looks just completely.  Look at this guy.  He looks completely ridiculous.  You stay for dinner.  Right.  Oh, wait.  I am dinner.  Yeah.  Oh, now they're putting a big fucking carrot weenie on him.  Yeah.  You got to put the big carrot weenie on.  They're putting the carrot weenie on the white guy.  If you're going to be hanging out with this tribe, you got to put the big carrot weenie on.  They're all going to laugh at him.  Yeah.  They're all laughing at his little white man weenie.  They gave him a tiny little carrot thing.  When these guys have like prehensile cocks that they use to fucking grab things with. 
[01:10:30]  Look at the white dude who has to put on the carrot thing and it's sticking straight out.  Unbelievable.  And now the tribesman is saying, I love you.  I love you.  You are not from here, he says.  Yes.  You wear trousers.  See, he should like.  But you must try to take them off.  Yeah.  Why does he wear trousers?  I don't know.  The guy's saying you got to take them off.  Otherwise, you can't wear the Coteca properly.  Is that what it's called? 
[01:11:00]  The Coteca?  Now look at his white ass.  He's naked.  He's naked with his carrot weenie walking through the fucking forest.  This is stupid.  It's 2009.  He flew there in a jet.  That's what I love about these shows.  The middle-aged white man.  He looks completely ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  Dude, he was sitting in first class at some point eating fucking a little meal.  You know, fresh baked fucking chocolate chip cookies and dessert.  Would you like another Sunday? 
[01:11:30]  Right.  All righty.  And then there he is with his pants off, his fucking pale white ass walking through the forest with a carrot on his dick.  Hunting for monkeys and trees.  Yeah.  With his blowgun.  Enough.  That is funny, though.  Enough about fucking Africa.  It's just a doomed continent.  There are some countries kind of getting along there.  But but for the most part, I mean, the continent is if it wasn't for the fact that it was kind of where all the cool wild animals live, you know, like, hey, there's lions there and fucking giraffe and shit like that. 
[01:12:00]  And and there, you know, on the outs.  But but we wouldn't give a flying fuck about that place.  No.  And and and the do-gooders want it to seem like they're doing good, but they're they're not.  There's no solution for that place.  They need to be civilized.  It's not charming. 
[01:12:30]  Is it charming?  It's not charming.  It's a guy with a carrot on his dick.  How are you supposed to talk to the guy and get things done?  You can't.  Too busy looking at the carrot on his dick.  You can't.  What the fuck is that for?  Got a carrot on his dick.  Does he have to keep going?  My eyes are up here.  Sorry, I'm looking at your carrot dick, sir.  Well, you got it.  I mean, yeah, come on.  He's got a carrot on his dick.  So there you go.  Clinton got that done for the the journalists.  Yeah. 
[01:13:00]  I mean, we've done the bit like the turn of the century before the Internet.  You're just living your life.  Yeah.  With your family, maybe doing a little farming every once in a while.  Maybe you had to go into a local war or something while horrific things were happening somewhere else in the world.  And guess what?  You lived your entire life without a clue.  People just didn't know.  Without a clue what was going on.  Didn't know.  The Vikings or whatever era you want to pick.  Yeah.  Just horrific things were going on.  And you were just living your life going, ah.  And I think, you know what?  In a way, you were better off not knowing.  Yeah.  I really believe that. 
[01:13:30]  What about like indigenous people to the to what is now the United States?  You might call them American Indians.  Sure.  Or whatever was living here in the United States when the Roman Empire was going on.  Like you're sitting there.  You got a little loincloth on.  You're banging away on a buffalo hide to make some shoes.  Sure.  And then half a world away is the Coliseum and this giant society of people waging war all over Europe, just conquering. 
[01:14:00]  And you have no clue.  No idea.  No clue that that was going on.  Do you think as a human being you're better off that way?  Um, yeah, in certain respects, sure.  Yeah.  Ignorance is bliss, they say.  John it down.  Well, something to be said about that.  All right.  Moving on.  So you got this song that Nick Cannon and Naz. 
[01:14:30]  It's all over YouTube.  Our pals at www.tdd.com.  Yes.  They have it featured prominently.  You can see the video for yourself over there.  The song's called Eat That Watermelon.  And Nick Cannon and Naz are in typical, like, black makeup, even though they're black to begin with.  Oh, like old blackface?  Yeah.  And I don't really... 
[01:15:00]  I try to do a little research on this, and I don't understand why.  I don't understand what they're trying to accomplish.  Do you know, Danny?  Yeah.  You do?  Yeah, basically, they're trying to say that hip-hop isn't where it used to be.  Sorry, can I...  Because I want to listen to you.  Satellite Matt, suggesting another Google bomb today.  Oh, my God, two.  That's confusing.  Well, the Paul Abdul one is very confusing, but he writes, how about we Google bomb Hillary Clinton saves the carrot weenie?  Stay away from that one. 
[01:15:30]  Let's continue with the Paul Abdul, but that's just a good lie.  Back to you, Danny.  I'm sorry.  So, yeah.  So, Nick Cannon and Naz, they feel that hip-hop is just getting a little too corporate, and, you know, it's getting...  It's almost getting to be a parody of itself.  Yeah.  So, they're saying, if this continues, this is what's going to happen.  Oh, it's going to turn into...  Like, this is where hip-hop is going.  Really?  Excuse me.  That's what they were getting at?  Black man in the White House, shut up.  So, they're just trying to, like, save hip-hop from becoming some...  They just want to make a silly video... 
[01:16:00]  Racist parody of itself.  Then they realize people are going to say, oh, man, that's pretty fucked up.  Yeah.  Uncle Tom races mother effers.  Yeah.  Motherfuckers.  Exactly.  So, they had to have a little spin on it, right?  So, it starts off, what?  Like a Star Wars thing?  What is this?  Ready?  All right.  There's a period of great distress in the rap universe.  There was a time when hip-hop was a form of empowerment.  Now, the corporate world is quickly diluting our culture for nothing more than profit.  With the ever-mountain forces of ridiculous dances, ignorant behavior, and general buffoonery, 
[01:16:30]  it's only a matter of time before hip-hop's permanent annihilation.  This is what the future holds if it don't stop.  A hottie there, Shook.  Top of the morning to you, Jam.  Boy, you know this show is a good ditty right here.  Massa gonna love us.  Mmm.  Mmm.  You know I was hungry.  What should we eat? 
[01:17:00]  Some of that good old watermelon.  Oh, yeah.  Eat that watermelon.  Eat that watermelon.  Eat that watermelon.  Surely it's good.  Eat that watermelon.  Eat that watermelon.  Eat that watermelon.  Surely it's good.  W?  Yeah.  A.  Uh-huh.  T.  Okay.  E-R.  What's next?  Melon.  Eat that watermelon.  Eat that watermelon.  Eat that watermelon.  Surely it's good.  Eat that watermelon.  Eat that watermelon.  Eat that watermelon.  I think it's time to break it on down. 
[01:17:30]  This watermelon ain't gonna eat itself.  Ham bone, ham bone, ham bone, where you at?  Ham bone, ham bone, ham bone, where you at?  Massa is coming.  Massa is coming.  Massa is coming.  Shh.  Hide the watermelon.  Hide the quiz.  Yo, check it, y'all.  This is Nas.  And if that don't stop, hip-hop is dead.  That's crap.  They just came up with a video that people would check out. 
[01:18:00]  First of all.  Yeah.  There's a couple of issues with that video.  First of all, if two white dudes did that video.  Oh, my God.  So fired from whatever they do.  Whatever they do.  Whatever they do.  They'd be fired from society.  Yes.  But, you know.  Yeah, I just don't get it.  It's a good video.  It is funny as shit.  And it's really catchy.  I'll give it that, yeah.  That thing is blowing up on the internet. 
[01:18:30]  But I don't understand how it's moving in this direction.  What do you mean?  Like, I don't see hip-hop moving into a direction where black people are going to be kowtowing  to the white Massa.  Like, I don't get that.  I don't either.  I don't even think they believe in the message they're saying there.  I think there's more, like, black record labels that are making a lot of money off of these  hip-hop guys.  I don't.  I think they came up with a good video. 
[01:19:00]  And then said.  And tried to figure out.  We need some kind of angle on this.  Yeah, yeah.  Or we're going to get crucified for this.  Holy shit.  It's just fucking every day.  Every day she's got to walk by here.  And she's wearing one of my favorite, the Partridge Family Bus Dress.  Yeah, the Partridge Family Dress is one of our favorites.  It's one of the Partridge Family Bus Dress.  Which is, you know, just picture the Partridge Family Bus, the pattern on that, on a little 
[01:19:30]  dress.  You're stammering.  One of those, because it's one of those dresses that she could just pull, like, grab the skirt  part of it and just pull it right over her head and be naked.  Yeah, it's like, it's very slinky.  Yeah, yeah.  Very summery.  Yeah, just.  A little sundress-y kind of a thing.  You know, she just puts it on over her head and just, and it just drops into place.  Yeah, yeah.  Nicole from the Morning Mashup.  Yeah.  I don't know what's going on with those three.  It's weird.  It really is a weird thing.  They're always together. 
[01:20:00]  During commercials, they walk down the hall and get a beverage together every single day.  How long have they been together?  I don't know.  I don't know much about that.  Can't be that long.  Wait till it's fucking 12, 14 years.  Jesus Christ.  They want me to talk to each other.  I'm fucking kidding.  We're in a good place lately.  It'll turn bad again.  So let's enjoy the good times we're having lately.  I like the jokes.  I know.  It's all good.  Paul, a black guy from Philly, wants to comment about the eat that watermelon. 
[01:20:30]  Paul, what do you got, buddy?  Eat that watermelon.  Oh, I'm sorry, fellas.  Oh, you were just singing that one, huh?  Yeah.  Catchy little ditty.  Good evening.  Good evening.  How you guys doing, man?  All right.  Pretty good.  When I saw that video last night at about 11 o'clock, I said, oh my God, when the boys  get a hold of this, it's over.  Well, it's just catchy.  It is.  It's catchy as hell.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't really believe why that video is out there. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, I don't see the, there's supposed to be some kind of a message behind it.  I don't see it.  The message behind it is the cooning that a lot of rappers like Lil Wayne with the jewelry  and other guys.  I can't even mention them because when I see the videos, I just turn the shit off.  Yeah, but who the fuck is doing that?  It's not, it's, it's not somebody that's going to make a massa or anything.  It's those guys.  The rap guys think that's fucking cool.  But they're actually not, they're actually, in my opinion, they're not actually talking 
[01:21:30]  about the white guys.  They're talking about the black guys who are, who are doing the buffoonery and rap now.  Yeah.  You know, I'm a general buffoonery.  General buffoonery.  I like general buffoonery reporting for duty.  I like buffoonery.  Well, I got to go, fellas.  All right.  And you know what?  What do you got to go?  What do you got to go for?  Oh, man, he's got a job.  I got to go make my little bit of money, Ant. 
[01:22:00]  There you go.  Oh, shit.  What corner?  Oh, Ant, he's got a real job.  Easy, easy.  You know, they call me Black Anthony.  Do they?  Yeah.  All right.  Why do they call you Black Anthony?  Why do they call you Black Anthony?  Because I view a lot of the same – I view things a lot of the same way that Anthony does.  You're my doppelganger.  Say again?  That's like the N-word.  I'm kidding.  Jesus.  Give my ass, Anthony.  All right.  There you go.  You're getting – you're getting – 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, I hear you.  You got to turn everyone off.  That guy likes you.  I like Paul.  He's a good guy, man.  All right.  Petey Greeny.  Petey Greeny.  Petey Green.  Yeah, CJ in Georgia.  What's up?  Hey, boys.  You're right, Pat.  Yeah, these guys aren't original.  Petey Green predicted this was where hip-hop would be going back in the 70s.  Yeah, we did the whole –  He taught us how to eat a watermelon.  Hi.  She is. 
[01:23:00]  Watch his family dress.  We're stopping our show.  Will you walk by so we get back to our show?  Jesus Christ.  It's just – I don't know.  I lose the ability to speak.  Yeah, you stammer when that one walks by.  Where's your little intern girl?  She was supposed to stop by yesterday.  Oh, she got in late.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Are you guys in a little contact?  What?  Who?  What?  What?  The girl that we fired Sam for.  There could be some Twitter – not Twitter, some texting going on. 
[01:23:30]  She was supposed to stop in yesterday and say hi.  Yeah, I know.  And that's one of the guys from the morning mashups, what?  Cousin or something.  Cousin or something?  Cousin.  All right, let's go back to the phones.  Ray in Maryland.  Ray?  What's up, guys?  No, you could call him Ray.  You could call him Jay.  You could call him Ray J. Johnny.  You could call him Ray J. Johnny Johnson.  But you doesn't have to call him Ray J. Johnson. 
[01:24:00]  Very nice.  Very nice.  Yuck.  I was just calling about the Nas and Nick Cannon thing.  Yeah.  You know, those guys aren't that far off.  And I'll tell you, Nas has had problems in the past.  I follow him a little bit.  And he had made an album called Hip Hop is Dead.  And basically, he called shit from the South because he was subliminally saying that the  South is what's bringing down Hip Hop because a lot of those fuckers in the South rap like  they can't read, which might not be that far from the truth. 
[01:24:30]  But the guys that you need to look at or look up are OJ the Juice Man, and that's spelled  D-A, OJ the Juice Man, and Gucci Mane, spelled Gucci and M-A-N-E.  Yeah.  I mean, they don't tell like they can read.  And they're rapping, and they're becoming more and more popular.  And I think, like you said, if this is what the corporations are promoting, there's a market  for it.  But it is some ignorant shit. 
[01:25:00]  Some ignorant shit going on?  Yeah, we'll check that out.  A song in general, give us their hit.  I turned the shit off, but I can't even think of any other songs.  I just know they're really getting popular right now.  All right.  It should come up on YouTube.  All right.  The guys down the hall, get us a hit from Gucci Man or OJ the Juice Man.  OJ the Juice Man.  I want to hear OJ the Juice Man more than I want to hear Gucci.  We got one? 
[01:25:30]  All right.  Hold on a line, Ray.  All right.  Juice.  Gooch.  Juice.  Gooch.  Have a break.  Have a break.  St.  Tove.  St.  Ticket.  Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Okay.  Okay.  This sounds like you ate that watermelon already.  This is both of them.  It is some ignorant shit, man.  I want to hear it kick in.  Have a break.  Oh, break.  Aye.  Quarter pound, half a pound, whole pound. 
[01:26:00]  Okay.  Honey pill, thousand pills, serving major weight.  Juice Man and Gucci Man, make the trap.  Aye.  Quarter brick, half a brick, whole brick.  Aye.  Quarter pound, half a pound, whole pound.  Okay.  Honey pill, thousand pills, serving major weight.  Juice Man and Gucci Man, make the trap.  Aye.  I'm booming.  I'm banking.  I'm serving all the babies.  Rap game easy, but the dope game gravy.  That young Jew man in my life is like the jake. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  With stupid, fruited, crazy sweat.  Jumping in your lady.  But now I'm a don't share an interior like the lake.  I'm a bronze, I ain't risked when I'm fucking with that cake.  Hit the trap, stay down, watch the paper rake.  I'm booming.  All right.  I guess they're talking about the dope game, my friends.  You got it.  The dope game.  Yeah, but I officially get it now because the watermelon song is that song.  They're parodying that.  Yeah, pretty much sounds like that.  Oh, and here's the video.  Look.  Look, the video's got like a lot of money and bitches and there's just ignat motherfuckers 
[01:27:00]  with all kinds of jewelry, some jewelry and some fucking grills and shit.  There you go.  All right.  I hear that.  So some of the rap guys aren't happy where rap is going.  It is kind of becoming a parody now that I look at this, but I don't see where I don't  see it becoming like blackface kind of buffoonery.  I see it becoming thug buffoonery, but like fake thugs. 
[01:27:30]  Well, let me play the hook to Eat That Watermelon because we just heard this real song.  Yeah.  Eat that watermelon.  Eat that watermelon.  It was the other part.  That's the hook.  Never mind.  I thought I had something.  I don't know.  I'm punching out as we say it.  Eat that watermelon.  Eat that.  All right, Ray.  Thanks for at least letting us in on what the fuck was going on with that Nick Cannon  Naz thing.  By the way, a lot of people are pointing out this.  Anthony in Mount Sinai.  Anthony.  Ew. 
[01:28:00]  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hey.  How are you?  Listen, that Eat That Watermelon sounds a whole lot like that fry that chicken that  you guys used to play.  Ah, fry that chicken.  Fry that chicken.  Eat That Watermelon.  Eat That Watermelon.  Eat That Watermelon.  You hear me?  Yes, very good.  And what it seems to be is, if you remember, old school hip hop started on the East Coast  and then the West Coast got big with Snoop and now it's the Dirty South as they're calling  it.  And I think Nas and Cannon are from the East Coast people. 
[01:28:30]  So it sounds like, you know, they might be a little annoyed.  Oh, yeah.  That's what it seems to be.  But it's all for the most part except old school ignorant anyway.  So many theories on what's going on in the hip hop community.  It's unbelievable.  Everything's a community, by the way.  Yeah.  And it's scary that I'm actually trying to theorize what's going on in the hip hop.  Yeah, exactly.  It is frightening.  He said, I'm the whitest what?  I'm about as white as can be.  There you go.  The community.  Thank you, Anthony. 
[01:29:00]  Steven S. from Bay Show writes, between Eat That Watermelon and, hold on a minute,  lost him.  Okay.  And Fry That Chicken.  We've got a couple of great songs.  I'm just waiting for someone to make, sip that grape soda.  Yeah.  Sip that grape soda.  We need a beverage now.  Yeah.  We got a food.  We got food.  We got a little dessert.  A little dessert.  Now we just need a little drink.  I got something to wash it down with.  Warsh.  Need to wash it down.  Um, let me go to Sean on Long Island.  Sean.  Pimp juice.  Sean.  Some pimp juice from Nelly. 
[01:29:30]  What up, Sean?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  This song sounds like that McDonald's commercial, you know, give me that Filet-O-Fish.  Oh, yeah?  Is it so?  You guys got that?  Yeah, we're good.  Have you noticed McDonald's commercials really do cater to the African-American community?  Why is that?  Why is that?  You ever notice McDonald's really is going for the black people?  Why is that?  Do they like a nice big burger more than we do as white folk? 
[01:30:00]  It's, it just seems to be, yeah, well.  You got it?  Give me back that Filet-O-Fish.  Give me that fish.  What if it were you hanging up on this wall?  If it were you and that sandwich, you wouldn't be laughing at all.  Why not get your own crispy golden Filet-O-Fish?  Let's go to Droopy. 
[01:30:30]  Droopy.  Good evening, boys.  Hello, Droopy.  Hey, Anthony, you do have to save Africa.  What are we going to do with all those undefeated New England Patriots perfect season t-shirts?  Yeah, where are we going to send all our, you know, shirts that we can't wear over here?  Well, we could send those over there.  I'm sure they'll end up on warlords' backs full of blood as they hack up somebody with a machete. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  Good point.  Watch it out.  Thank you.  Let's go to Brian in Jersey.  Brian.  Good evening.  Hey, Brian.  I just wanted to say that there's been, like, this hip-hop counterculture kind of thing going on for a while.  Two of the artists that stick out of my head are Common and Salute Quali, where they're talking about stuff that's not all, you know, let's kill each other, drugs, banging bitches, that sort of thing.  They've been talking about, I mean, it's not all about community values, but that's kind of more the stuff that they're saying. 
[01:31:30]  And they're talking about things like, you know, don't leave your kids to grow up with one parent and stuff like that.  Who's rapping that shit?  Talib Quali and Common are the two names that come to mind.  Even, like, Kanye to some extent, he a little bit talks about all the violence that's going on in Chicago and stuff.  He's a little bit more mainstream, but you can tell that there's some elements.  It certainly helps with 14 Shot the other day in Chicago.  I guess that really does help.  The hip-hop really is a... 
[01:32:00]  I'm not saying it necessarily helps, because, you know, there's a lot of draw to the game, as they call it, you know.  But I don't really...  I know the game, my friend.  I never really was into hip-hop when I was growing up, but I've gotten into it a little bit,  and that's really the only stuff that I can stomach, is just listening to stuff that's not all about, you know,  dealing drugs and stuff like O.J. the Juice Man that you just played.  You know, Danny brings up a great picture over here. 
[01:32:30]  What happened to DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince?  The Innocents.  My goodness.  Now we're talking some whack rhymes.  Some rhymes that didn't hurt anyone.  This was so...  Look, parents are all the same.  Oh.  No one's hurting when they listen to this.  No, this is fun.  Sure is.  Non-threatening.  You didn't care if DJ Jazzy Jeff or the Fresh Prince was at your house, right? 
[01:33:00]  Of course not.  No, they'd be spinning records and just making fun and moving in fast motion.  When hip-hop guys are moving in fast motion, it's funny.  Oh, my mom started bugging.  Nowadays, if mom is bugging, you shoot her in the face.  Then I blew her in the fucking head.  Right. 
[01:33:30]  Who turned all this around?  Was it Dre?  Do you have to go to Dre?  Well, I think you got to go to like N.W.A.  N.W.A.  Ghetto Boys.  Said, fuck this shit.  Said, what is this fucking shit?  Right, right.  This ain't from the streets, yo.  This motherfucker's gonna be a big movie star.  Keith in Philly brings up a good point.  I did read this.  90% of these lying a-hole rappers rent their jewelry and whips, by the way.  Jury?  Jury, yeah. 
[01:34:00]  My jury.  All that stuff is pretty much rented for the videos and whatnot.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, because no one makes that type of money, no matter what you do.  Gotta have your own grill, though, yo.  You ain't putting no one else's grill in my mouth.  Tom, Chicago.  The fine, windy city.  Hey there, Tam.  White Sox or Cubs, Tom?  Well, the Cubs seem to be doing quite well.  Yeah.  A little bit.  Actually.  Although, you know, that no-hitter on the other side of town was pretty cool.  Yankee win.  Sox lose.  Yankees a game and a half ahead. 
[01:34:30]  And what about the Mets?  Let me look up the Mets.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, it looks like some douche decided to post on Yahoo Answers, is it true that Paula Abdul  quit idle due to an impacted colon?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And he looks a whole lot like Ope, and his name is Gregory.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Nice.  Thank you.  Thank you, Tom, if that was you.  If not, whoever did that, wonderful. 
[01:35:00]  What's the Google Bomb again, Andy?  You got the exact one?  Oh, my God.  Paul Abdul quits idle.  Quits idle due to impacted colon.  That's it right there.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Gotta do it that way, or we're not gonna get credit in the end.  Nate in Atlanta wants to answer your McDonald's question, Anthony.  Nate?  Yes?  Good evening.  Hello, Nate.  Yeah, McDonald's caters to the blacks because it's really cheap, it's really unhealthy, 
[01:35:30]  and the corporations, man, they want to kill off the blacks.  Oh, is that it?  It's a big conspiracy.  Well, that's why all the liquor stores are in the black community.  They're run by people outside of the neighborhood, and cigarettes and things like that.  Newport?  Yeah, yeah, I hear you.  I love the liquor store thing because I live in an incredibly white neighborhood here in Manhattan,  and just as you said that, I started counting the liquor stores close to my building. 
[01:36:00]  It's amazing.  And I was up to four, and I decided, you know what, I don't need to count any higher.  Yes.  That's within two to three blocks, I could go to four different liquor stores.  Yeah.  So shut up with that conspiracy crap.  Liquor stores are everywhere.  I remember college, MD 2020 and Colt 45 being the cheapest stuff,  so all you have to do is look in the couch cushions for change to go out and get drunk.  Oh, yeah.  You ever go through your pockets and feel a piece of paper and go, oh, a dollar,  and you pull out like a 10 or a 20 back then? 
[01:36:30]  Oh, my God.  Dude, it was like, holy shit, I'm hoping for 50 cents.  I'm hoping to get like a couple of quarters, and there it is, a 10.  Oh, and then you're fucking set for a couple hours.  Yeah, that's all you need it for, a couple hours.  Yeah.  Get yourself a nice sandwich, a big tall boy, back to the house, turn on some TV.  Living large, my friend.  Let's go to Matt on Long Island.  What's up, Matt?  What's up, man?  Hey.  Listen, you should listen to some Immortal Technique. 
[01:37:00]  He raps, but it's all about like politics and the president and what's going on with that.  It's like the media and the politics.  But who really wants to hear that?  I think a lot of people kind of...  Yo, give the guy a second.  I think you might actually, if anyone might actually take the only type of hip-hop and take it into consideration.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Maybe on your own time, go get some Immortal Technique, check it out, look it up on the  computer, play a few of his songs, and he rips apart the whole government and how the media 
[01:37:30]  takes part of everything, and I really think he'll take it into consideration.  Yeah, but like most people want to hear about Slingin' Dope and, you know, and Buck Buck.  Yeah, well, that's why I'm a white man calling another white man telling you what's good in  the hip-hop world.  Yeah, I hear you.  Do we really have O.J. the Juice Man on our phones?  Is this the O.J. the Juice Man?  Yeah, yeah, this is O.J. the Juice Man.  What do you got?  I'm trying, we're trying to put good music for the people, you know what I'm saying? 
[01:38:00]  Everybody's bitching about us, but we're putting out the music that the people want to hear,  you know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  We know what you're saying.  Well, what's the deal with, you know, you're making people look goofy.  You're practicing buffoonery.  Yeah.  I'm not, we're putting good music for the people out, you know what I'm saying?  We're putting out what they want to hear. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  Fucking Emmys and all these fucking guys, you know, this guy's fucking washed up and he  want to, you know, jack on our shit.  Yeah.  And he can handle it.  We sell it and they flop it, you know what I'm saying?  Well, what are you singing about?  No, I don't know what you're saying.  Yeah, we're trying to figure out what you rap about, saying, stupid white guy that I am.  We rap about what the streets want to hear, you know?  About the drugs.  No, we were putting positive messages out. 
[01:39:00]  Positive messages?  I got a question for you.  How do you say jewelry?  You say jewelry?  What are you trying to get smart with me, boy?  It's jury.  Jury, right?  Jury.  If that's what you want to say, you know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  How's Mickey doing?  And fucking Adrian.  I'll fucking whip you.  Hey, let me tell you.  No.  I'll fucking, I'll whip you real fucking good, boy.  Maybe Sylvester Stallone was onto something. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, who is this guy?  He created a whole genre of hip-hop.  I'm doing the hip-hop there, Mickey.  Hey, I'm rapping.  There's a lot about you in the streets.  Hey, I'm O.J. the Juice Man, Mickey.  Where's the fuck it is?  I go out to New York City, ain't fucking me.  You know, it's nothing to me.  It's fucking money.  It's money for me.  Yo, hey, I was thinking maybe we could go to the zoo, see some tigers.  Well, it's every fucking night, you know what I mean? 
[01:40:00]  All right, then.  All right, well, let's say goodbye to the Juice Man.  Go fight Apollo Creed.  Can we go back to, what was that fucking song?  Yeah, Digital Underground, The Humpty Dance.  The Humpty Dance is hysterical.  This is when rap didn't hurt anyone.  No.  All right, ah, yeah.  Now that I told y'all a little bit about myself, let me tell you a little bit about this dance.  It's real easy to do.  Check it out. 
[01:40:30]  First, I lift to the side like my legs was broken.  Shaking and twitching, kind of like I was smoking.  Yeah.  Crazy, whack, funky.  People say you look like MC Hammer on crack, Humpty.  That's all right, because my body's in motion.  It's supposed to look like a fit or a convention.  Anyone can play this game.  This is my dance, y'all.  Humpty Hump's my name.  No two people will do it the same.  You got it down when you appear to be in pain.  Humping, funking, jumping, gig around, shaking your rump.  And when a doo-doo jump pump points a finger like a stunt, tell them step off. 
[01:41:00]  I'm doing the hump.  The Humpty Dance.  Here's your chance to do the hump.  Say harmless.  Say.  I do the Humpty Dance.  Just doing about the Humpty Dance.  Fun.  They weren't killing each other or nothing.  It was just the whole fun.  Getting hurt.  The Humpty Hump.  Let's go to, wow.  What's your name?  Topher.  Topher?  Yo, yo, yo.  Yeah.  Like Topher.  Good evening.  Hey, Topher.  How are you, buddy?  Good evening.  Good evening. 
[01:41:30]  Hey, listen, Anthony.  Between the Taconic Parkway and LA Fitness, how many white people were killed versus the  people who were killed in Chicago you keep talking about?  What?  See, there was a white guy that went into an old women's gym outside what?  Pittsburgh?  Oh, right, right.  I'm not saying that doesn't happen every so often.  You can kill five or six women.  Crazy white guy.  I've talked about crazy white guy all the time.  Yeah, because crazy white guy seems to kill a lot of innocent people where I think the 
[01:42:00]  black-on-black crime, and I'm not making a sweeping generalization like you do, a lot  of guilty people probably biting a bullet there.  I don't know about that.  I think there's a lot of robberies of people that end in gunfire violence, perhaps.  No.  Yeah, I see it.  I watch First 48.  All right.  Yeah, we get crazy white guy.  Every so often, you read about crazy white guy. 
[01:42:30]  Or drunk and high white girl.  No, that's kind of, yeah.  I'll give you that, but, you know.  That was, uh, that's that show on true TV.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  The hot girl, white girl in the bikini that had a couple of beards.  Yeah, that was nice.  All right, thank you.  Thank you, Topher.  Hammer's dick dance.  Danny put up Hammer's dick dance.  MC Hammer's dick dance.  That was him jumping the shark, right?  Oh, please.  Yeah, the shark was in his pants.  I think he, I think this was after he had already jumped the shark. 
[01:43:00]  I believe the shark jumping song was that Addams Family song, if I can remember the name of it.  It's just the other song with a different name.  Yeah, remember that?  The same song.  Yeah, exactly.  Just gave it a different.  With a big swinging meat.  Yeah.  Obama.  The Addams Groove.  The Addams Groove, yes.  Why did we have the auto-tune news piece today?  There's a new one.  It's a series.  All right.  Yeah, I know.  So there's been a lot of auto-tune talks, so I figured I'd pull it. 
[01:43:30]  I don't think we brought the auto-tune the news to our show yet, so maybe we could do this.  This is actual current news stories, Anthony.  Yeah?  That are pretty big out there.  But then you auto-tune it.  Ah.  Here's the first one.  Let's get it right.  Let's get it right.  Shorty on the mic.  The fact is that right now, if you are black or he's funny, you have a much greater chance  of being arrested.  Are you saying we got thugs in the box?  I think early when it comes to the world, blacks.  Real talk we got. 
[01:44:00]  Got together smoking lettuce, please.  Let us leave.  They do me in the slammer.  They gave me a college degree.  WTF.  In biology.  You don't know what tiger for, but giraffe.  It is painful, it is shameful.  It's painful, I'm on the road.  I'm keeping my glass of champagne full.  Top of the world, brick on my ankle.  If you're stopped by the police, put your head down and just wait.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Don't say nothing.  Shh.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Put your head down.  Put your head down and just wait. 
[01:44:30]  This is going on all the time.  It's pretty stunning.  Auto-tune.  I'm not a fan of this.  It's really funny.  It's, I mean, I guess when you see the video along with it, it's so annoying.  It really, that auto-tune thing, god damn, do I hate that.  I think Cher started it.  I still say that.  Yeah, yeah.  I think Cher was the one.  Let that do believe it.  All right, well, texting while driving is dangerous.  There's a million of these, but we'll just do one more.  Yes. 
[01:45:00]  Texting while driving is dangerous.  Dangerous.  Treacherous.  People who were text messaging were 20 times more likely to have an accident than those  who were talking on phones instead of typing.  Just say no.  But I'm a sucker for peer pressure.  My thumbs can't stop.  Get a designated texter.  People on the road can turn an LOL into a great big OMG.  People on the road can turn an LOL into a great big OMG.  People on the road can turn an LOL into a great big OMG. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  What are you doing with that?  You're not feeling the auto-tune news?  No, no, I'm not really feeling it.  Not at all.  All right, we can go back to what we were just talking about, Stacy in West Hampton Beach.  Stacy.  Stacy.  Hello.  Hi, Stacy.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  What's up?  You're talking.  Talk to your phone.  Yeah, Stacy, you're on the radio. 
[01:46:00]  Don't talk to the radio.  Talk to the telephone.  What would you like me to say?  Well, you called us, Stacy.  See, I don't think she...  I would like you to play the young MC.  A little bust a move?  Yeah, please.  Young MC was very harmless.  I was driving home from Philly on what day?  Late Sunday, I guess?  And there's a station on Sirius XM that goes old school like rap.  Oh, really?  There's all that garbage?  It was good for a good hour of driving, man.  Yeah.  And a little bust a move was on there. 
[01:46:30]  Bust a move.  Who doesn't like a little bust a move?  Ah, yeah.  This here's a jam for all the fellas.  Try to do what those ladies tell us.  Get shot down because you're overzealous.  Play hard to get females.  You're jealous.  Okay, smarty.  Go to a party.  Girls are scantily clad.  A chick walks by, you wish she could sex her, but she's standing on the wall like he was  poindexa.  Next day, she's dancing.  I'm going to punch him.  Scoot is serving your stone-cold one.  But once again, no one getting hurt, eh?  No.  They're just dancing and having fun. 
[01:47:00]  A girl starts walking.  Guys start gawking.  Sits down next to you and starts talking.  Says she want to dance because she likes the groove.  So come on, fatso, and just bust a move.  Oh.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Yeah.  Bust a move.  Anyone know the channel that does the old-school hip-hop?  Because I don't know.  65.  It is 65, Kenny?  What?  Backspin.  Hey, Kenny, how about one of those nice bagel turkey things?  Oh, wow.  Of course, Anthony.  Thank you.  I want some oatmeal. 
[01:47:30]  Of course, Opie.  Wait, you listen to old-school hip-hop on channel 65?  I love my SiriusXM radio.  Does it bring back memories of just racking head with a nightstick?  I'm begging for the best of Sirius package if anybody hears me.  Dude.  These fuckers around here, it's enough.  All I've heard.  They're tightwads about giving free programming to the people that work here.  Enough already.  All I've been hearing from are people going,  Enough already. 
[01:48:00]  My radio doesn't work.  My radio stopped working.  Anthony, you gotta help my radio.  I can't hear my radio.  I'm like, all right, Sal.  I'll see what I can do.  Anthony, it's time for some consulting.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  See, Kenny wants the best of what?  Sirius?  Yes, the best of Sirius package.  And they're kind of giving him a bit of a problem with that.  Why?  Now, how does that hurt the company if one of your employees gets the best of Sirius?  That means Kenny, when he's out doing whatever the fuck he does when he's not fetching stuff for us, 
[01:48:30]  he's going to turn people on to SiriusXM.  It's as simple as that.  Yeah.  If you're an employee here and you go to the bosses and go,  I want 10 free fucking units with free programming, don't even question it.  Just give it out.  That's more exposure.  How does it cost them more if they just give?  It's not like, wow, well, the satellite has to pump out a little more power.  Like, how does it cost more to just hook you up with that? 
[01:49:00]  Like, they have some weird rule around here.  If you work for SiriusXM, you're only allowed one free or two free, something.  Something ridiculous when they should just be giving it out to everybody that works here as many units as they want.  Yeah, and then you get in the car and you go, hey, check this out.  What is that?  Oh, yeah, it's my Sirius Satellite Radio.  Not only that, it boosts morale.  It sure does, Kenny.  Yes, it is a morale booster.  It sure does.  No petting the dog today.  This is a rolling up the newspaper and slamming the newspaper on the dog's nose. 
[01:49:30]  He needs a little on the snout.  Their logic on marketing is unbelievable.  What do they think?  They got a bunch of employees here that are just taking advantage to the point where they're just giving it to just strangers?  No, pretty much if you work here and you go to the boss and go, look, I need another unit for whoever, you shouldn't question it.  Just go, okay.  Yeah, it's nice.  It should be the perk of the gig.  But there's rules.  No, only one per employee or two or whatever it is.  It's some dumb thing. 
[01:50:00]  Dumb.  Dumb, I say.  I don't think it's really taking anything away.  $200.  Wow, that's cheap.  Yeah, that is cheap, GH.  Make check payable to Greg Hughes.  Leave that opie off my checks.  I can't cash checks that have opie on it.  What the fuck can I do with that shit?  You ever get any of those, brother?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  I'm like, what are you thinking?  Really?  How the fuck am I going to cash this?  I'm trying to cash a check that has my nickname on it. 
[01:50:30]  Really?  Yeah, they're going to really give a shit at the bank when I try to explain it.  But I am slick.  Are you trying to get the best of serious, Kenny?  Yes, I am in the process of begging.  And see, and this has been going on for a couple weeks.  He's in the process, Ant.  He's in the process.  In the process.  It's not, oh, you want that?  Okay, we'll get that done within an hour.  No, it is a whole process.  It's a whole process of something that is supposed to take, like, mere minutes.  I don't know.  They contact Hooray, who talks to Hoorah, who calls up Mrs. Mantia, and they're like, hey, 
[01:51:00]  Joey, should he have best of serious?  No.  Yeah, and then it goes through the grapevine, and then they play Telephone.  He's got all the...  He's not even...  I mean, I know.  This is kind of accurate, actually.  It's a big approval process.  Yeah.  You know what?  If I was this company, I would just give away radios.  Give them away like crazy.  I would give them away all over the place.  Yep. 
[01:51:30]  With a free three-month or whatever it is.  Get them hooked.  And then people would be like, what is that?  Learn from the drug dealers.  Right.  Give them a taste.  Learn from the hip-hop guys.  Right.  Give them a little taste.  Give them some buffoonery.  They're going to come back for more.  It's just basic marketing.  Right.  But to be a pain in the ass with your own employees because they want a few extra fucking units  is just like...  It's just so cheap.  Cheesy.  Enough already.  It's real cheesy.  Enough already.  Come on, man.  You know how many people have turned on a satellite just in my dumb life because people jump 
[01:52:00]  in my car or they're in my apartment?  Wow, what's that?  Well, we're listening to commercial free radio.  Oh, I didn't know SiriusXM had this type of music channel or whatnot.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What do you want to hear?  Yeah.  Next thing you know, guess what?  They're buying it for themselves.  Right.  Yeah.  And they got something for everyone.  They sure do, Kenny.  They sure do.  What's your favorite these days?  Guitar.  I'm all over the dial.  I listen to Chill.  No, you don't.  Yeah, I listened to it for three seconds this morning.  You don't like it. 
[01:52:30]  I'm still on the coffeehouse kick.  But this old school hip-hop thing, it has potential in my little world.  Yeah, it has a little potential.  Is it a specialty program or is it a classic hip-hop all day long?  I don't know.  I think it's an XL channel, 65 Backspin, and then 67 is Hip-Hop Nation.  You know why it's an XL channel?  Yeah, because they like to curse.  They say nigga.  They do use the N-word, as I like to call it.  You can't call it the N-word if you put on the classic hip-hop channel and every other fucking song has about a hundred of them in it. 
[01:53:00]  Well, I don't like to offend people, Opie.  That's why I just say the N-word.  I said a GGA, though.  I know that.  Okay.  I understand.  I'm smart.  Thank you, Kenny.  All right.  I'm going to fetch your breakfast now.  Yes, let's get some grub.  You're really good at fetching.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I look forward to it.  I bet. 
[01:53:30]  And I know we're heading toward a break, and we're going to have Jim Jeffries on the show in a few minutes here.  But you want to do the Obama Joker posters because we brought that to everyone's attention?  Yeah.  So there's posters going up all over the place.  We're going to learn more about this, but basically—  I want to know what the outrage is.  It's Obama looking like Heath Ledger with the Heath Ledger Joker makeup on.  Yeah.  Well, I didn't want them to think Jack Nicholson Joker makeup.  Oh, no.  That would just be silly.  Yeah.  No, it's the—he—you know, it's all the smeary—you know. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  And I don't—  In the words of the—  Oh, what were you saying?  I don't understand why, really, but—  Well, Julie Mose is going to tell us all about it.  Thank goodness.  In the words of the Joker—  Why so serious?  You'd look serious, too, if you were the President of the United States being portrayed as the Joker.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my goodness.  Goodness.  Are they really freaking out?  Who would freak out that much over this? 
[01:54:30]  It's a socialism.  Like I said, they—how many posters did you see of George Bush as Hitler?  So many of them.  No.  And there wasn't this, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Democrats are such little pussies.  Take your fucking messiah president and have a sense of humor or have a sense of fucking freedom of speech where you can parody him and put socialism underneath the picture of him with the Joker makeup on. 
[01:55:00]  It's the big deal.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Like they were showing fucking that piss Christ thing.  Yeah, that was like whatever.  Oh, my God.  Are you really shocked?  Here, let me—with three clicks of my fucking mouse, I'll shock the shit out of you.  You'll never see a dog getting off this way in your life.  I miss the good old days when Rudy Giuliani was telling us what art was. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  Those were fun times.  Yeah.  Good times.  Good times.  The Virgin Mary met out of elephant shit.  Oh, whatever it was.  He didn't like that one.  But he doesn't even know the definition of art, so he's going to just tell us, no, that's not art.  I know art when I see it.  Piss Christ.  Right.  Actually, Piss Christ, the photo of it, the way it was shot, was very kind of holy looking.  It was very golden looking. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, some people might—  I mean, you know, the fact that he had to use urine to actually get that shot, but—  Some people—  If you didn't know that was piss, you would just think, wow, that's a beautiful shot of a crucifix.  You would actually hang that on your wall if you were—  Yeah, you'd be like, look, it's like glowing light of heaven on you or something.  If you didn't know, for real, that's a really good shot.  Yeah.  Some people go, wow, that's really artistic, and others would say, yeah, it's not.  And then once you find out—  You can't start telling other people what art is, though.  What would you do if I told you that was in a jar of piss? 
[01:56:30]  Piss?  Piss, piss, piss.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my goodness.  Goodness and the Joker don't usually go together, but on conservative websites, this image is the latest thing.  Someone took Time magazine's cover and transformed it.  Hope was changed to joke.  The image is making its way onto T-shirts and onto a few posters alongside a highway ramp in L.A. 
[01:57:00]  Accompanied by the word socialism, the image got Rush Limbaugh's attention.  He's becoming cool to make fun of Obama.  Maybe not quite so much in New York City.  Yucky.  Extremely disturbing.  Stupid.  Seems kind of childish.  Whether you like the guy or not, you still don't do that to anybody.  Oh, shut up.  And you know what?  I sort of lean a little more toward Obama, you know, than Anthony does.  It's like, shut up.  You don't do that to anybody.  What?  No, really?  You don't Photoshop anybody? 
[01:57:30]  That's some idiot that has no idea what Photoshop is.  Everyone's been Photoshopped.  At this point, everyone has been Photoshopped.  Shut the fuck up.  Oh.  And then there's more.  To cash in, the website Hero Builders plans to sell an Obama Joker action figure for 50 bucks a piece.  But for some, the image is downright disturbing.  I think I do have a problem with the white face.  Makes me think of blackface.  Back when President Bush was in office, he got the Joker treatment. 
[01:58:00]  So did Hillary Clinton.  But when it comes to the current president...  It's a right-wing spin.  It's disgraceful.  It's disgraceful, and you shouldn't even bring any attention to it.  Have a nice day.  Bye.  Oh, you fucking liberal cunt.  Shut the fuck up, you baby, no sense of humor, lib cunt.  That's it.  Goodbye.  That's all.  I don't want to hear anything else, because that's all.  My opinion, right?  Everyone else is an asshole.  Shouldn't even bring attention to it.  But if it was Bush... 
[01:58:30]  Well, we're looking at a picture.  They actually did it to Bush?  Yeah, we're looking at a picture of Bush.  They did the exact thing to Bush?  Same thing.  With the Heath Ledger makeup?  Actually, a much better version.  Yeah, that's pretty...  That kind of looks cool.  That's pretty evil, man.  And that woman wouldn't have said two fucking words about it.  She'd have laughed with those stupid, stupid lib friends as they talk about global warming.  Go shove it up your vagina.  Your hairy vagina.  I can't fight the good fight.  The whole right versus left fight.  Oh, I can't be bothered.  I can't take it. 
[01:59:00]  All day on the news.  Back and forth.  Back and forth.  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  Shut up.  God.  Yeah, there's Hillary as the Joker.  I mean, it just became a thing to do.  Yeah, but she went...  That one's old school Jack Nicholson.  That's not as impressive.  Yeah.  It just kind of became the thing to do, though, for a while, is to superimpose his makeup  on people's faces.  Right.  So what? 
[01:59:30]  Right.  It's the big deal.  Why?  Why, because it's Obama, is it so disgraceful?  And oh, oh, Christ.  He's not Jesus.  Well, yeah, well, except for that.  Well, there is Jesus.  There's so many postage uptown.  I've seen news footage, not actually been uptown ever, but I've seen...  I told you, Eric.  I've seen news footage, and they are selling pictures, portraits of Obama as Jesus.  I told you a long time ago, in the end, a lot of people are going to be disappointed 
[02:00:00]  that Obama doesn't change the world.  Yeah.  That's going to be the big disappointment for a lot of people that voted for Obama.  Wow, wait a minute.  He didn't do half the shit I was expecting him to do.  That, to me, as a Catholic, is more disgraceful than him as the Joker, is him dressed as Jesus,  and him superimposed on Jesus.  Because, you know, I was raised a Catholic, Opie.  I'm a strict... 
[02:00:30]  I follow Catholicism very strict, very strongly.  Do you eat meat on Fridays?  Huh?  Do you eat that meat on Fridays?  Oh, I fucking dig in.  You dig right in?  I eat ass on Friday.  Can't have meat, but I sure can have ass.  Oh, there's nothing in the Bible that says you can't tongue an asshole.  You ever think that shit?  The dumb rules, well...  I guess they didn't want to get into specifics.  Yeah, can't eat...  But you see some hardcore Catholic eating ass on Fridays, though. 
[02:01:00]  I'll shove my tongue so far up there, it'll hit the taste buds that can only register bitter.  That's what I want to do.  Yeah, how does that happen?  Those taste buds aren't used often, are they?  No, they're not.  The old bitter taste buds.  That's when you use them, though.  You gotta go in deep to register that taste bud.  Yes.  Is there another food on Earth that actually registers that taste bud?  The bitter. 
[02:01:30]  That fucking taste bud is asleep most of the time.  Anyone can get the sweet taste buds up front.  Sure, sure.  You get that little...  But to really, like, shove it in there to the bitter ones in the back?  Wow.  When is the bitter taste bud?  Yeah.  Ever really used?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Well, you got the one example.  Yeah.  Give me number two.  See, the middle of the tongue...  Give me a number two.  Not many.  The front is salty and sweet, and the sides are sour.  But bitter. 
[02:02:00]  So you don't want...  You never want the sides to register when you're tongue deep in an asshole.  You want the sides to say, I don't fucking taste the goddamn thing, because they're sour.  Now, the sweet and salty right at the tip, that you're gonna taste.  But then those big, lumpy taste buds in the bitter area, and your tongue back there is ribbed for her pleasure.  See, God laid it out for us.  If you look at the diagram that we're looking at of the taste buds, God basically is telling you, you really shouldn't be sucking cock. 
[02:02:30]  The tip of the tongue is the salty and sweet, so you're like...  Yeah.  But then it goes all the way to the back of the throat.  God's basically saying, no.  No.  There it is.  No.  No, what are you doing?  It's picking up on all the bitter.  All the bitters.  Basically saying, get this fucking filthy cock out of your mouth.  I'm a little surprised.  I knew that the back was bitter, obviously, but I didn't know the middle of the tongue, not many taste buds. 
[02:03:00]  And very nonspecific.  Why is that, you think?  I don't know.  Probably because that area of the tongue is just used for...  It's like a holding area.  Yeah, yeah.  Before you do the swallow.  Before you swish it around to the part of the tongue that's good.  Good.  Well, Greg Brady's leftovers from Wisconsin.  Okay, we get it.  You guys hate our president.  I don't really hate our president.  You guys.  I don't really...  I just don't buy into the crap that one guy's going to change the world, no matter what side he's from. 
[02:03:30]  Sorry, Obama fan.  Sorry, Obama fucking fanatic that there's a couple of people out there that think his policies are for shit.  He's not experienced enough, and his foreign policy is a load of crap, and he's appointing fucking activists.  All right.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Well, Jim Jefferies has been waiting to come in here, so why don't we take a break, Ant?  Yes, let's do that. 
[02:04:00]  Just did about an hour and a half.  Holy shit.  Hopefully our grub will be here and we could eat during the commercial.  Well, that's why we stalled.  I know.  I saw that.  See?  We're smart.  Smart.  That's so you don't have to listen to us eat on the air.  Yeah.  We got the Getting High number two in the series of Getting High.  Yeah, I love this one.  Bits that Danny has taken upon himself.  Getting High number two stars Ron Howard, the original.  You can remember with laughing a lot. 
[02:04:30]  And Seth Rogen.  Seth Rogen laughed a lot.  So check this out.  Got that right.  You just heard Jim Jefferies, and Jim Jefferies is in studio, ladies and gentlemen.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  For the first time in what?  Like six months?  Yeah, just before the special.  So that was like February or something.  So yeah, a bit late.  How long ago?  And we're here every day.  Yeah.  Doing the same old, same old.  And then you go off and travel the world, then you come back and say hi to us.  I come back here.  Actually, that's the first time I've heard.  I can't watch myself ever on screen.  I just listen to that routine. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  And the only time I have watched that routine before, and that's the routine about my mom  being fat and being named after an elephant and anyone who hurts, everything.  My parents, I came home to Australia, and I put that on the DVD player, and I sat next  to Gunter as I'm going, my mom's a big fat bitch.  One of the most awkward things in my whole life.  Did she laugh?  Well, she did that thing when your parents want to believe that you're a good person.  Like, if they catch you drunk, it's some other boy who pushed it on you, or whatever.  You know what I mean?  If you find drugs, you're holding them for someone else.  Yeah.  Right?  She did that thing where she just goes, oh, you've got quite the imagination. 
[02:05:30]  I don't know how you come up with these things.  And my dad just looked at him and goes, oh, no, they still fucking call you Gunter.  And I was like, ever since that's come out, it's like the floodgates have opened, like  cousins and brothers and all that are all just calling it to her face.  Oh, she's miserable.  Oh, shit.  You're doing Gotham Comedy Club tonight?  No, I'm doing...  Tomorrow night, I'm the host of...  They're doing Live at Gotham, the TV show.  I think Norton did it last year.  Yes, he did.  And I'm hosting that, so I don't know whether there's tickets available, but ring up Gotham 
[02:06:00]  Comedy Club, there might be.  All right, for tomorrow night.  It's for tomorrow night, yeah.  Speaking of Norton, we haven't talked about it yet, but there's going to be a big press  release.  Actually, it hit the paper in New York.  He's going to be a correspondent for Jay Leno's new show.  Really?  The 10 o'clock version of the Jay Leno show.  Norton is going to be one of the correspondents with D.L.  Hughley and a couple other people.  He's going to be one of the street guys, or what do you mean?  Like, going to interview people on red carpets, or...?  I'm not sure what the thing is.  We're going to get the whole scoop tomorrow when Jimmy's back, but it's a huge, huge, huge 
[02:06:30]  thing for Jimmy, obviously.  And he's not leaving the show or anything, by the way.  You know, he might have to miss pretty much what he does now.  Where is he today?  He still has to pay a mortgage.  Yeah, he does it, you know, a couple weeks.  Next thing you know, he's gone for a couple days.  It'll be that type of thing.  They're showing the plane with those Asian girls that were...  Oh, really?  ...in Korea.  What, they're landing?  I just said they're coming back in.  If this plane crashes live...  Oh, my God.  ...how awesome a bit of footage is that? 
[02:07:00]  Oh, my God, right?  Here comes...  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to go into the Hudson.  Where are they?  L.A.?  Yeah, it has to be.  We're in L.A.  Because I see that KTLA.  Clinton's on the plane as well, isn't he?  Is Clinton on that one, or did they drop him off?  It was his plane that came and got him.  That's why I was saying it wasn't a dignitary thing, because the plane's got no markings on it.  There's no way Clinton's on that plane right now.  He's on the plane.  He's going to come out and do a little wave on the tarmac thing.  Oh, yeah, good point.  Everyone's down.  Look, everything's nice.  Good landing.  Good landing. 
[02:07:30]  I love it when they...  Clint walks out and, you know...  That's a real American thing that you guys, sometimes when I'm on planes...  Because I get flying on a lot of planes.  Sometimes when I'm on planes, you guys applaud when the plane lands?  I've never done that, and I've thought everybody that does it is stupid.  What do you do if it fucking crashes?  That's what it does.  Yeah.  Boo!  You're shit!  This pilot stinks.  That's odd.  That applauding thing is really strange.  It is.  It really is.  I mean, if you get...  By applaud, that's what's supposed to happen. 
[02:08:00]  You're supposed to take off, get to where you're going, and land.  I almost understand if you're doing some circles, and there's a lot of bumps, so it's  like kind of a pain in the ass, and it's not a normal, you know, landing.  Yeah.  But just a basic landing, and people are applauding.  But it's also American people applauding in cinemas at the end of movies, or when they  see a celebrity's name come on the screen.  Ridiculous.  If the person can't hear you, don't applaud.  We like applauding dead people, too.  Boy, that is an unmarked plane, huh?  That is a generic airplane.  Well, that's what they said.  They unmarked the plane to say that it wasn't an official government thing. 
[02:08:30]  Yes.  Meanwhile, you know, it was probably being shadowed by fighters, and...  Yeah.  You know, if Clinton was on that thing...  Originally, it just had a big picture of the Joker on the end fin.  Yeah.  Obama's face as the Joker.  I think it's funny that Obama's face is a Joker.  Why wouldn't you want to have that?  People are...  No, you know what it is, though?  If you're really liberal, it's such an insult.  It's an Oscar-winning role.  It's a bit funny. 
[02:09:00]  You know, he pulled himself up by the bootstraps, and now he's the president.  He did not pull himself up by the bootstraps.  Yes, he did.  Shut up.  Republican Nazis, shut up!  All right, we get it.  He grew up in Hawaii.  I know.  He's a nerd.  Indonesia.  The guy's a nerd.  Hawaii.  And...  Stop with pulling himself up by his bootstraps.  He had enough time to be a community activist or something.  An organizer. 
[02:09:30]  Organizer.  You know what I was organizing?  My change.  So I could fucking count it, and then go to the deli and maybe eat.  And that's why you'll never be president.  Right.  That and your attitude.  And yes.  And the fact that, you know...  You showed no interest.  I could have sworn an Italian would have been in there before a black guy.  Yeah.  Could have sworn it.  But nope.  No.  Look at that Trump.  Wasn't meant to be.  No, we're the downtrodden.  They'll never let an Australian in either.  Let's see this Clinton get off the plane with the two journalists.  I'd say Clinton's not in there. 
[02:10:00]  You don't think he is?  He has to be.  I think Jeffries is right.  He parachuted out of them.  I bet your five or he's in there.  Huh?  I bet your five bucks.  Yeah.  Go on.  Five dollars.  But why does it say, awaiting arrival of freed U.S. journalists Laura Ling and Yuna Lee...  Maybe they didn't want to advertise that Clinton was on the plane.  But Clinton...  Here we go.  President Clinton's like the big one.  Here we go.  Plane carrying President Clinton and two journalists into Burbank, California.  God damn it.  You owe him five dollars.  We didn't shake on it, so we're all right.  All right.  I'm going to let it fly. 
[02:10:30]  So what?  Now you have to just wait for this plane door to open?  Yeah.  I know.  It's like...  We should talk in between.  It might be boring radio if we just leave.  If we just watch it.  All right.  You think it's getting clearance to do everything it wants, or you think it's got to go...  Do you reckon...  Mr. President, Ms. Ling, and Ms. Lee, we've landed on time, but our gate seems to be occupied  right now, so we've got to sit here on the tarmac for a half hour.  Sorry about the inconvenience. 
[02:11:00]  Please fly Plane White Rapper Airlines.  Do you reckon...  No frills, remember?  Yes.  No frills was the white.  But Clinton's got to have been blown by one of those girls.  That's what I'll be saying.  We're all saying it.  That's what I'll be saying.  He goes, do you know how he must have fucking got...  Who is that?  He must have gotten fucking, like, all right, I got you free.  Yeah.  Come on.  Come on, baby.  You never see that Joker fella do it for you.  Yeah, exactly.  Pull right up.  You think Clinton's got to wait at the baggage carousel? 
[02:11:30]  He's like, all right.  Mr. President, you're at baggage carousel three.  We're going to find out.  Hey, can we get some audio up?  What do I do?  Is he going to talk?  Is he going to speak?  I do this over here, right?  Now, what...  What would be nice is...  Harry's buggy out here in the summer.  Oh, no.  We're getting Joan Rivers.  Joan Rivers.  We're getting TV land.  I don't want Joan Rivers.  Joan Rivers likes me.  Does she?  Yeah, I flirt with a woman.  I've met her a couple of times.  Fuck it, really?  Yeah, she's at the Edinburgh Festival.  She was in the room next door to mine. 
[02:12:00]  No, no.  No, no, no.  I wouldn't even touch a daughter.  No, no.  No, really?  Huh?  Oh, no.  I wouldn't either.  What happened?  What do you got?  You got sound?  I don't hear anything.  Breaking news.  Let's see.  Why don't they give him some stairs?  That's a long jump.  No, they're not going to wheel up the stairs?  Who do you reckon comes out first?  Clinton first?  Just three dollars.  That's not it.  I would say this isn't it either.  That's a commercial.  What the fuck?  We can never get the tip.  What did they just throw out of the thing?  This isn't much of a system, is it? 
[02:12:30]  What are they throwing out of the plane?  What the hell is that?  That's a special plane.  That's Bill Clinton's used condoms.  Oh, there we go.  There we go.  Oh, look at that.  A little ladder thing.  Yeah, that's it.  Oh, this is the worst feed, though.  That comes out of the plane.  This feed is horrible.  Homer Hostius from North Korea, journalist.  Mort Zuckerman, you have dealings with Bill Clinton.  You say he remains as a guarantee.  You could serve us all over the place.  A person as ever.  Just a remarkable, remarkable person. 
[02:13:00]  Someone wrote, I got you free.  Want a cigar?  Yeah.  Let's celebrate with some cigars.  I'll smoke mine.  That's when he pulls out a cigar,  and they just start freaking out.  Like, no, no, I actually like smoking cigars.  Relax.  I'm amazed those fucking stairs came out of the side of the plane.  That's pretty cool, right?  That's pretty good.  That's fucking amazing.  The issue is,  does this mean anything for the negotiations  that we hope we're going to have with North Korea  to contain their nuclear weapons program?  Yeah, Bill will go over there.  Why didn't he just take Hillary's job away? 
[02:13:30]  Why not?  Yeah, this makes her look bad, right?  It certainly does.  Let's see them get off the plane,  then we can move on with our radio show.  That's her gig, isn't it?  She's the international thingamajig.  Yeah, yeah.  Secretary of State.  There you go.  Oh, man.  Bill Clinton may have gotten some valuable information.  Paul Abdul's leaving American Idol,  just flashed up on the bottom.  Glad they're getting it all in.  You know why?  She's a drunk.  She's got an impacted colon that she has to take care of.  Really?  Yep.  Impacted colon. 
[02:14:00]  An impacted colon.  Look on Yahoo Answers, Danny.  It's all over the place.  It's all over the place.  How do you impact a colon?  That's not big shit.  That's...  Shit gets packed in there.  Yeah.  Oh, there's too much shit.  It's not like...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was thinking an imploded colon.  Oh, no.  That's different.  They've got to scrape the shit off the walls.  Said we not had access to...  Got to clear out the pipes.  Is it true that Paul Abdul quit American Idol due to impacted colon?  See, it's right there on Yahoo Answers, Jim. 
[02:14:30]  How many answers we got so far, Danny?  See?  Very interesting dynamics.  There you go.  You can see for yourself.  Yeah, but these are real answers.  These are just people going, I think so.  Now, this guy says that it's a fact.  Oh, well, if this guy says it's a fact, yes, it's true.  See, it is true.  They're all waiting out there.  Clinton's like, I'm almost done.  I'm almost done.  This guy says...  Like, he's just fucking in the bathroom.  But how...  Wait, wait.  I want to go to Danny for a second.  Because we're getting answers to the Paul Abdul impacted colon. 
[02:15:00]  So history's happening on one TV screen, and we've been diverted.  This is called, you know, we're just...  It's filler until Clinton shows his face.  This guy says, yes, it's true.  At first, he was just going to take every Monday off,  but then the producers realized that would just be ridiculous.  Yeah, every Monday off.  Have you heard the new word, Monday?  Not yet.  Hold on.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  We got the guys with the...  Who are these guys?  That's the captain.  The press?  Yeah, Clinton and the girls got to be the last ones to deplane. 
[02:15:30]  And also for President Clinton.  And what?  They got medical people going on the plane first?  Yeah.  There's a rape scene in there.  They're taking a rape kit in.  Some swabs.  And Clinton goes, I just passed out.  Yeah, I don't know what happened.  I don't know.  Bigger than life.  There was turbulence, and she fell on my face.  I mean, he is one of the most compelling and engaging... 
[02:16:00]  Where is he?  Come on, let's go.  We got a radio show to do.  Extraordinary in that sense.  No podium, though?  No red carpet?  No, they're going into the airplane hangar.  That's where the press is.  No.  Yeah?  I think so.  Why would he get out there?  Here's the guy that has to take the bags off.  Oh, who's this?  No.  How many people are on this fucking plane?  Not many.  I just want four Korean hookers coming out now.  Yeah.  We love you long time. 
[02:16:30]  I want that one.  I freed these girls as well.  Yeah.  He's just went around freeing some other girls.  I love you long time.  Me so horny.  All of us to watch and really think about that bigger conversation, which is, why did Kim Jong-il do this?  In other words, beyond pure sort of terrorism slash rabble-rousing, was he trying to get the former president there to try to initiate some sort of direct communication in the bizarrest of ways? 
[02:17:00]  And, of course, what is it...  Wow, this takes a long time, huh, man?  Yeah, no, no.  I get through customs faster than this.  More bags.  Come on, how much luggage do these girls have?  Right?  How nice is this prison?  Damn.  Wait, CNN is behind...  Oh, Fox is behind CNN, I guess.  Because we saw that guy with the bag already.  Right, so there's a guy walking back in.  Yeah, CNN's behind Fox's.  Fox is ahead.  Fox is ahead now? 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Yellow shirt guy handing over some suits.  The yellow shirt guy actually looks like Obama, by the way.  Yeah, he does.  He does, and that's just not being, I mean, he's mixed race, but he really does.  Jason has more info on Paula Abdul.  She got impacted colon from the painkillers.  All right, I accept every, who of us can say that we haven't had an impacted colon?  But it only takes...  It's got to be pretty serious, though, to give up a multi-billion dollar gig.  How long does it take, like a week to clear your colon, just because colon's sick for a week? 
[02:18:00]  It's not like American Idol, that's like four months of television.  Yes.  Yes.  Well, are they towing this plane somewhere?  Well, now they're towing it into the hangar.  Get out of the plane.  No, they've got to pull the stairs up to tow it.  They can't just leave them dangling at the side.  What's up with this red carpet service they're getting?  Yeah, I never got that.  Get off the plane, get your luggage, and beat it.  These girls were treated better in Korea.  This morning she was on the...  Another guy, that means nothing. 
[02:18:30]  My God, how many people are there?  I like how in Fox they still have the inset of the Joan Rivers interview.  So you can watch both.  Ha ha, Joan.  Joan's a twat anyway.  She's a bit of a cunning.  No, why?  Because they did a roast, and she told everyone, don't go after my daughter.  You can't do a roast and say that.  If you do a roast, you've got to be all in.  And she walked off of a news program.  And she walked off a news program because someone mentioned her daughter.  And made a joke about her daughter.  She goes, yeah, she goes very weird about her daughter.  And that daughter's talentless.  Then don't do the fucking roast. 
[02:19:00]  Put your daughter on it.  Here we go.  And who?  Nope.  Guy in a yellow shirt.  There are so many people on this fucking plane.  As Mike just said, you know, the connections here are very strong between, you know, this  personal military mission and the United States government just by the nature of familial  The fact that an ex-president went over there, the husband of the Secretary of State, it makes  it kind of an official fucking former President Clinton on the little mission that it was on. 
[02:19:30]  It is official.  Because if it wasn't official, why didn't they send me?  Or, yeah, just send you over there.  I'm a charming guy.  Or usually, don't they send fucking stupid Jesse Jackson?  He goes everywhere and gets people released.  I like the Sharpton.  He's my new favorite.  Yeah, the Sharpton.  I love the Sharpton.  Ever since he got up and went, there's nothing weird about your daddy.  What was weird is what he had to put up with.  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  Like, give us some credit.  Michael Jackson was fucking weird. 
[02:20:00]  He was fucking weird.  You can say he was a great artist or whatever.  He was fucking weird.  Don't say he wasn't weird.  Yeah, the one thing we can all agree on was that Michael Jackson was weird.  Fuck, he probably one of the biggest weirdos in the public eye ever.  Ever.  Yeah.  As far as the public eye, absolutely.  Top five, easy.  The guy had a nose that had fallen off.  That's fucking weird.  What he went through was weird?  No.  No.  Uh-oh.  I think we're getting close.  Some of the news stories he gave us were weird.  They're still just giving the love games.  Then he should have pointed at the youngest one and gone, your name's fucking Blanket. 
[02:20:30]  Your dad was weird.  Yeah.  Just reinforced it.  Blanket is so pretty.  I don't think that worked out well for Sharpton.  Didn't it?  Defending Michael Jackson.  That was a little weird.  Oh.  Come on.  Let's go.  There's a lot of people.  People, they said that just Clinton went.  Clinton went with like 50 guys if you're not watching it.  They had to.  Oh my God.  Look at all the luggage.  Why is Obama taking the bag?  There's better ways to get luggage off a plane.  They have systems for this. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  This whole manually carry it down the stairs shit.  I don't think they want to spend too much time in North Korea.  So they're like, grab your luggage and get on board immediately.  It's all carry on.  We're not taking any chances.  Don't check your luggage.  Are you crazy?  Yeah.  Don't carry luggage for anyone else either.  Grab your stupid bag and get on the plane.  This thing leaves in 30 seconds.  Yeah.  Right.  It's rolling.  And now the guy with the yellow shirt again. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  He's the baggage guy.  Guy in the yellow shirt.  We like doing his bit from time to time.  Yeah.  Most famous person in the world right now.  Right now.  Right here.  Right now.  Everyone's watching him.  Yes.  We especially want to thank President Bill Clinton for taking on such an arm.  Why doesn't everyone just carry their own bags individually rather than setting the yellow shirt going?  And no one's got like the blue or pink bag.  There are all these black bags.  These very secretive.  What my mom did when I left Australia, she tied some fluorescent ribbon to my handle so I could find it on the carousel. 
[02:22:00]  And you find it.  That was smart until everyone started doing that.  So every bag has the fluorescent ribbon.  It still has it.  It's a bit faded.  I've been out of Australia for eight years now with the same bit of fluorescent ribbon on that bag.  All right.  What's going on now?  Oh, yeah.  What?  Wait, they're showing.  Wait.  Hillary talking.  Those two girls.  Oh, that was them going on the plane.  Okay.  More luggage.  And there's the guy in the yellow shirt again. 
[02:22:30]  This could be it here.  This could be it.  And I guess what this all goes to from the North Korean perspective.  Yeah, yeah.  This could be it.  From the American perspective on North Korea is, again, why did they do this and why?  There's Clinton.  Where?  He's in the door checking the top left there.  But that's them leaving.  No, that's them leaving.  Oh, that's them leaving.  All right.  They don't have the money shot yet, so they have to go with the old footage.  Oh, that we're all watching this morning.  Yeah, we're all watching.  All right.  Quick to modify that sentence, which suggests, again, that there's something more valuable. 
[02:23:00]  Are they in there?  I love North Korea.  Imagine, we got a problem.  One of the girls dropped dead during the flight.  Oh, man.  Yeah, it was some kind of amyl nitrate poppers they were doing.  Holy shit.  She's bleeding from the vagina and anus.  Someone get a new dress.  Bill Clinton just gave her an impacted colon. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, shit.  How good is that first shit going to be for these people on American soil?  Oh, it's always nice.  Nothing better than a good American shit.  I've never had a...  The whole time I was in high school, the toilets were so horrific.  I never had a shit my entire school career.  I did at home.  Are you one of those guys?  Never whilst...  I do now.  I'm a public toilet guy now.  Who gives a shit about them?  They're bringing another chick in for them.  That might be...  What do they want?  It's another girl.  They want a unilateral, bilateral relationship. 
[02:24:00]  That's what Clinton is negotiating right now, like a hostage.  Now Clinton's holding them, and he wants more girls.  Because they just brought in a brawn.  Yeah, they just brought another girl in there.  I want to speak to Jack Bauer.  I want lots of girls.  Bring them in.  These bitches are mine, motherfucker.  Clinton, can you take your tie off your head?  We've got to de-play now.  You've got to look like a fucking former president, please.  I'm back in the game.  Will someone sober this fucker up? 
[02:24:30]  The world is watching.  His pants are off, and he's doing the tuck.  Everyone loved Clinton, didn't they?  Clinton was the last president that everyone loved.  Republican.  Republican conservatives didn't like him.  Yeah, I wouldn't call it.  I wouldn't say everyone, but a lot.  Australia loved him.  A lot.  Australia thought he was the best guy ever.  More than Obama?  No, Australia were Bush people.  Yeah, literally.  Bush people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That makes sense.  We have a lot of...  Another pilot. 
[02:25:00]  How many people flew this thing?  Why does it have to be a thing?  I bet they had like eight pilots on this thing just in case something happened.  But why does it have to be a thing, and why can't they just get off the plane?  It has to be...  I'm like, what's he doing right now?  Just sitting on a right?  Come on already.  Right.  Am I ignorant in saying I didn't know these girls were arrested until they got freed?  Yeah, I didn't either.  All right, fine.  So isn't it weird that we're so excited about something we didn't even know happened?  Imagine he grabbed the...  So how many of these people are in prisons right now wanting to be freed? 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  All over the place.  Yeah.  That'll just never fucking be freed.  Imagine...  There's going to be lots of them, right?  Imagine they grabbed the wrong women.  Yeah, yeah.  These aren't them.  They all look the same.  They kind of look like the girls.  I saw the picture.  I thought I'd just grab them.  Turn this fuck around.  We'll go back.  I say anything to stay away from that fucking cunt wife of mine.  If they want to rejoin the rest of the world, rejoin the West, stop being so provocative they can. 
[02:26:00]  So she's not saying...  Pardon and false.  Months of talks between the White House, State Department, and North Korea.  Really?  And we just thought...  I didn't hear one thing.  I didn't hear anything.  Clinton was over there fucking him like Hawkeye out of mesh.  Let me go to Bud the Trucker because I think we have time here.  Bud, go ahead.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Is this going to be the next big video?  Two girls, one president?  Oh, when you...  Oh, yeah.  You tripped up a little bit.  Oh, a little bit. 
[02:26:30]  Very good there, Bud.  Thank you.  Good.  Let me say hi to Footer.  Footer.  What's up, boys?  Hey, Footer.  Hey, man.  Hey, I guarantee Clinton's cell phone's blowing up right now and fucking Hillary like, what  are you doing?  Why are you in there so long?  Yeah.  Are you fucking these broads?  Get out of the plane already.  Just wanted to say hi.  Yeah.  Hi.  Just calling.  How you doing?  And he's probably making some jokes like, when you go down to Paniston, does it go...  Oh, wait.  They're putting the fucking stairs back in there. 
[02:27:00]  They're sucking the stairs back in.  Oh, fuck!  And then they're probably gonna...  Just get off the plane.  It doesn't have to be a thing.  They're towing this plane inside where no one could, like, see them.  Why do we have to always make it a thing?  I've been on a lot of planes, though.  I've never seen stairs like that.  Whoever made those, it just sold them really well.  That is really the best stairs ever on a plane.  The hangar door.  The hangars are opening up.  Look at this motherfucker.  All right.  Do they have cameras inside?  Oh, yeah, they do.  Probably not.  That's where the press is.  I think they'd have shown it.  No, they showed, like, the press just hanging out waiting. 
[02:27:30]  Wouldn't you love if that guy just forgot there were wings on the plane and dropped it now?  It's not even real.  It's a hoax.  There's no girls on that.  They're gonna appear out of the hangar.  They've been sitting there for about an hour.  Yeah, it's like one of those bad fucking David Copperfield tricks.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, Travis, screw Jack Bauer.  Clinton knows how to do 24 hours the right way.  Yeah, this is...  This is a fine 24 hours for...  Now they're shutting the door again.  This is one of the worst episodes in 24, though.  Yeah, it's horrible.  The plane landing one.  Like, occasionally breaking to the clock. 
[02:28:00]  By the way, everyone making the blowjob joke, I think we hit our quota officially, so...  Yes, yes, we hit our...  Let's try to find another angle with this thing.  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't...  So, I thought they were American journalists.  Or are they American Asian journalists?  Yeah, they're American journalists.  Well, the one is the sister of the girl that was on The View.  I always forget her name.  Lisa Ling.  Luna Lee and Laura Ling.  Yeah. 
[02:28:30]  It's hard to say that, isn't it?  You say that quick.  Yeah.  They love the letter L.  They love the letter L, don't they?  They can't get enough of it.  Yeah, yeah.  That's enough to get you arrested in some countries.  Having an alliterated name like that.  All right, now the hangar door is open.  I always look at hangar doors.  The well-polished floor.  I always look at hangar doors and they leave that little box at the open for the top of the wing.  Yeah, the big tail.  Just make the fucking door bigger.  Like, what's the big deal?  Really?  Your aim better be good when you're going in that thing.  This seems like a design fault where they've gone, oh, fuck. 
[02:29:00]  Cut a hole out here, you dickhead.  Keith in Montreal has a very good observation.  Keith, go ahead.  Where do they get the luggage?  If they were arrested over the border interviewing refugees, who give them luggage?  I'll tell you where.  Duty free.  How do they get their luggage back?  That's all bottles of Kalua, mate.  Duty free over in North Korea.  That's got to be a treat.  Bye, guys.  Nice, Keith.  How do they get their luggage back?  Little porcelain statues of what's-his-name, Ming-O, whatever his name is. 
[02:29:30]  What's-his-name?  Kim Jong-il.  Kim Jong-il, that's the right.  Kim Jong-il.  Pat from Anaki writes, ironically, these Asian broads had a happy ending.  Look at that.  They got a big ceiling fan in there.  And people want to know if we've reached our quota on ass-eating jokes.  No, never.  Adam Hogan from Brooklyn.  We didn't even do an ass-eating joke.  We just took an ass-ruin anus joke.  We didn't talk about eating it.  No, prior to you coming in, we were discussing ass-eating. 
[02:30:00]  Sorry.  Sorry.  Are you a proponent of-  I'm an ass-eater.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  It's the only time you taste bitter.  A man can never be a real man.  We learned that that's the only time you taste bitter.  Yeah, yeah.  The taste of bitter.  You got to bury your tongue right up to the bitter taste buds.  Yes.  In the back.  All right.  The plane is now in the hangar.  Now it's in the hangar.  All right.  Here's the end.  All right.  Here we go.  Here's the husband and the kid, and they're waiting to see it come in.  Now they got to shut the- 
[02:30:30]  I want to see that cool ladder come out again.  I want to see if this little girl runs up.  Well, it's going to be a wonderful photo op.  Yeah.  The little daughter running up to mommy.  I'm not even going to make a nasty joke.  This might be as cute as hell.  Ah, probably not.  You know what I mean?  There's pedo jokes with Clinton aplenty ready to go, but I'm not going to do one.  The floor is so well polished that she's probably going to run and fall and hit her head.  Smack her head on those state-of-the-art stairs.  Yeah, that is a clean fucking hangar, man.  They got it all nice for this.  And the plane is nice and shiny. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  Do you think those fans do fucking anything?  Oh, there's probably a lot of engine heat.  Here comes the Welcome Home banner.  Oh, no, they're bringing in different stairs.  And this is the Welcome Home stairs.  They're doing that same thing.  You know when you land, and you're comfortable when you're in the air, but when the plane lands,  everyone gets up and stands in the aisle where you crouch down or whatever?  Yeah, you just want to get the fuck out.  And they've been standing for ages.  Please don't remove your seatbelt until the plane stops.  That's always a fucking lie, isn't it?  The plane's going two miles an hour.  The second you hear the nose wheel hit you, you hear... 
[02:31:30]  Don't take that off.  You know some intern had to run out and get the Welcome Home banner?  It was some intern's job.  And they just got the same one from when the Celtics won the league.  Yeah, what is it?  Fucking green.  Why is it green?  It's the only one they had.  There's probably a reason it's green.  All right, the door's about to open.  Yeah, they didn't want to get a red one.  Okay, the stairs are in place.  We're waiting for that door to open.  Okay, what do you reckon?  Clinton first or the girls first? 
[02:32:00]  I think the girls first.  Girls first and then the hero, Bill Clinton.  Clinton rocks.  Clinton's going to wave his dick around.  He's going to stick his dick out and make it do circular fucking motions.  You know what?  Here we go.  All right, the pilot opened the door.  All right, there's the girls.  No, we haven't seen the girls yet.  Those are the two girls right there.  Oh, okay, this one's behind.  Here they come.  This TV, Anthony, this one.  And they're crying, hands in the air.  Cheers in their eyes, I guess.  They're going to be welcome home.  And the kid couldn't care less. 
[02:32:30]  The child could not care less.  She's like, who are you?  Where have you been?  The kid has no idea what is going on.  You've been away for a while.  I've grown up.  She just wants to go.  You left during my informative years.  I have no idea who you are.  Lisa Ling is there, too.  Yeah, she is.  Lisa Ling.  And then inadvertently gets sucked into the jet engine.  As Bill Clinton turns on the switch.  Stick from Wackbag.  The hangar floor is so well polished that Bill Clinton will be able to see up everyone's skirts.  Ah, is that what it is?  Make sure it's shiny. 
[02:33:00]  I think Bill requested that in.  Making it nice and shiny.  The kid could give a flying fuck.  The kid could not care.  That this mother is gone.  She doesn't even know.  He just wants a happy meal.  Yeah.  She's been sitting there.  Since she's been gone, we've been eating Lucky Charms every meal.  Steve, let me get Steve on the phone before Clinton makes his appearance.  Steve.  Yo.  Hey.  Hey.  It took so long because Clinton was going to...  There's Al Gore.  They strapped him up like Hannibal Lecter going there. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, so he wouldn't fucking rape the women.  He's got a Hannibal mascot.  He's going to come out and go...  Yes, Al Gore is right there.  Al Gore likes it whenever an airplane's land and the environment's slightly more fucked up.  Yeah, he's private jet.  He's always around.  He's so full of shit about the environment, that guy.  And I apologize for steamrolling the banner should be yellow joke that you had, which was a fine joke.  Oh, was that a joke?  I just thought maybe yellow ribbon.  I was being serious.  Why?  What's the joke? 
[02:34:00]  All right.  Well, people said that I steamrolled your yellow banner line.  No, I didn't mean it like that.  I actually thought because welcome home is like the tie a yellow ribbon thing.  Around the old oak tree.  Right.  I wasn't making any epithets.  It wasn't like, you know, an oriental jaundice-y type of thing.  Yeah.  No.  Al Gore on site.  I guess these girls were working for Al Gore's what?  On the left, it looks like Tony Hawk.  I don't think Tony Hawk would be there, would he?  Yeah, what?  Skateboarding. 
[02:34:30]  He goes, you can't find this surface anywhere.  Yeah.  It's the best surface, man.  It's tearing up.  So, Chester's liver from whack bag.  Clinton is playing.  Here comes the airplane with the girls.  The airplane into the hangar.  Why isn't Clinton off?  They do just wait to...  Because he's letting them have their moment.  Yeah, this is showbiz.  This is showbiz now.  This is all...  This is showbiz.  The opener is there, and then the headliner comes out.  And what is the purpose of Al Gore?  I think they worked for Al Gore.  These two journalists were working for Al Gore in some capacity. 
[02:35:00]  In this case, his fucking TV show or whatever he does.  Whatever it was, yeah.  Because we're dealing with such an intensely...  Oh, ooh.  I saw that guy in Tora, Tora, Tora.  He just looks like a guy in every Godzilla movie.  He does look like that.  He was in Midway, I saw him.  He looks like he's got a lot of wisdom.  He looks like Krakatoa, East of Java.  Don't talk about Otto in front of him.  There's Bill. 
[02:35:30]  There he is.  Hey.  Hey, everyone.  Hey, how you doing, Al?  Remember when we had the job?  Yeah.  Look at him.  You fucked it, Al.  You fucked it.  Yeah.  I fucked this shit, man.  His face is so red.  Look at how red he is.  That guy couldn't be gayer.  Wow, who's the homosexual with him?  With him.  Wait, you were hugging on the plane.  You don't have to now hug off the plane.  No, that's not the same woman, you racist.  Oh, yeah.  That's what I was.  That's Mama's son.  I swear to God, that's the same woman. 
[02:36:00]  Jesus.  Look at Bill.  I did it.  That's me.  I was talking to Lisa Ling.  Mm-hmm.  A little shake of the hand.  Your family's important.  Yeah, I'm really meant to do the job.  Bill Clinton, an international celebrity.  I was hoping I would secure their freedom.  Again, to this day.  Wow, Bill looks a little teary-eyed, huh?  Does he?  A little bit.  Yeah, he's like, fuck.  The side of the United States.  I'm going to have to go back to Hillary. 
[02:36:30]  That'd be teary-eyed, too.  He doesn't look as red on CNN.  No?  No.  That feet up top, though.  He has the brightest, reddest face.  His white balance, the camera.  He looks normal on the other one.  He does look normal.  But it's funny, because on Fox, everyone else isn't red except for him.  Right.  Yeah, so what the fuck is that?  That's bizarre.  Oh, yeah, he really looks red.  He looks over there.  Our own hostage just sent a message, by the way, for the guys down the hall.  Norton just sent a message. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, did he?  So if we could get that on the air after the break.  It was easy.  That little fucker I showed him.  Oh, Jammer.  Jammer was listening to what Clinton had to say.  Jammer?  Hey, morning, boys.  Hey.  That's the first thing he says when he gets up to the podium is, I didn't have sex with these girls.  Not at once, not ever.  All right.  Look at him.  Are we done with this?  He's got to talk with all the people now.  Who are these people? 
[02:37:30]  Dignitaries.  I don't know who they are.  They're just family members, I guess, right?  So I went in there, and they aren't sideways, as rumor has been.  Straight up and down like regular girls.  Straight up and down like six o'clock.  It's amazing.  I thought it would be like nine and three.  You want to see the greatest pussy video ever?  I didn't forget, Ant.  I didn't forget.  I didn't forget.  Bunch it up.  Are we done with this thing?  Yeah, we can turn the volume down.  We're done.  I think we're done.  He's talking about Lisa Ling.  The world's free again, but for how long? 
[02:38:00]  For how long?  Indeed.  We're hanging with Jim Jeffries.  We're about to watch the greatest.  Is it a cunt video?  When you say pussy video, what's your...  This is the greatest pussy video.  I challenge anyone to come up with a better pussy video than this.  Is it offensive or beautiful?  You'll see.  No, it's just odd and funny.  Just watch this, Jim.  It's not crazy, though.  I naturally react.  We're confident.  You got a naked skydiver.  Okay, yeah.  Isn't that great? 
[02:38:30]  Look at that.  It's a nude skydiver, and her pussy lips are flapping.  Her cat looks like my mom's neck.  It is flapping.  Yeah.  That is...  Is that the greatest pussy video you've ever seen?  Yeah.  Non-sexual, certainly.  Yeah, non-sexual.  Non-sexual greatest pussy video ever.  You couldn't masturbate.  Oh, Lord. 
[02:39:00]  But now, strangely, the gain is in me.  I want to see a cock in the same situation.  Oh, that would probably hurt like a motherfucker, dude.  I know.  I want to see a big sack in a...  Danny's like, all right.  There's got to be one, right?  Danny's good.  He'll probably find it.  Danny is the king of the internet.  There's no one better than Danny.  He usually does find everything.  He's got a high percentage of finding what he's looking for.  Yeah, the kid is probably so used to mommy being gone, because she's one of these fucking, 
[02:39:30]  you know, let me go off to a foreign country and be a reporter, that she didn't know what  was going on.  Right.  Yeah, and you assume that no one's told the child either.  Yeah.  No one ever tells the three-year-old that mommy's in prison in Korea.  Yeah, mommy's in prison in North Korea.  Hard labor or whatever.  Yeah.  Horrible, horrible place.  How do you teach her that?  Do you sit her down, show her a couple episodes of M.A.S.H.?  She probably thinks some Mexican woman freaking, you know, raises her.  It's her mommy.  It is odd in this...  Oh, they're going to talk? 
[02:40:00]  She's about to call.  I want to thank Bill Crenter.  All right.  30 hours ago, Yuna Lee and I were prisoners in North Korea.  We feared that at any moment we could be sent to a hard labor camp.  Oh, they wouldn't.  Oh, they didn't even do the hard labor camp. 
[02:40:30]  Any moment.  Suddenly we were told that we were going to a meeting.  What did you think?  What do you think?  What did you think?  We were taken to a location and...  Look at Bill smiling.  When we walked in...  She was just sucking my dick.  ...through the doors.  The most horrific sight ever.  He saw us looking before us.  President Bill Clinton.  Look at him.  Oh, you know.  He's doing his mouth thing. 
[02:41:00]  If her next sentence is, we were raped, awesome.  We ran back to ourselves because we know about this guy.  Instantly in our heart.  We decided we'd rather have hard labor.  We'd rather go to hard labor.  The nightmare of our lives was finally coming to an end.  Look at Al Gore, how old he looks.  And now we stand here home and free.  Uh-oh.  Yuna and I would just like to express our deepest gratitude to President Clinton 
[02:41:30]  and his wonderful, amazing, not to mention super cool team.  Super cool.  Super cool.  Yeah.  Super cool.  We're super bad.  Justin Cooper.  Dr. Roger Band.  Clinton is the coolest man on earth right now.  Yeah, yeah.  Wouldn't that be great if Oscar music started playing right now?  I'm like, it's enough of your fucking speech with your thank yous.  You're done.  Fucking Clinton hung out in North Korea and came back to tell about it. 
[02:42:00]  Get the star.  That's pretty fucked up, man.  Get the star on.  Secretary Clinton.  Vice President Gore, who we also call Al.  We call him asshole.  That's because he was never president.  Kurt Tong, Linda McFadden, and the people at the U.S. State Department, who are so hard  What about Kim Jong-il, who actually said okay?  Did you thank him?  Steve Bing and his crew.  I'm sorry. 
[02:42:30]  This is like an Oscar speech.  And I know that I am forgetting a bunch of people.  I'm forgetting a bunch of people.  This is an Oscar speech.  Forgive me if I'm a little incoherent.  Why?  What happened?  Clinton fucked up brains out.  To our loved ones, friends, colleagues.  My director.  And to the complete strangers with the kindness of hearts.  She's not going to thank us, is she?  Our listeners are brutal.  They're like, wow, that other one's sure not a looker. 
[02:43:00]  No, huh?  And also, we call it Laura Ling and Lana whatever.  And now it turns out that one of their names is spelt with an E.  Oh, really?  Yeah, and the other station was spelling it with an L.  That just shows how beautiful it is going in the darkest of hours.  It is what sustained our faith that we would come home.  Yeah?  Yeah, no, the other one's not a looker either.  The past 140 days.  I don't know how much weight she lost while she was in there.  The most difficult, heart-wrenching time of our lives.  140 days? 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  It's been a while.  We are very grateful that we were granted amnesty by the government of North Korea.  And we are so happy to be home.  And we are just so anxious right now to be able to spend some quiet, private time getting re-equated with our families.  Thank you so much.  All right, bring on Bill.  Bill.  The other one's not talking.  Bring on Bill.  Come on, the other one can't talk.  The other one's not talking.  Yeah. 
[02:44:00]  And who are you going to thank?  Mr. President, would you like to say a few words?  No, Al Gore's going to do it.  Al Gore?  No, no.  Bill, put Bill on.  Ladies and gentlemen, the family has asked me to say a few words.  Boo!  Boo!  All of us, and on behalf of the staff and families of Turn TV.  We want to thank President Bill Clinton for undertaking this mission and performing it so skillfully. 
[02:44:30]  I don't care.  I don't care.  We play key roles in this.  Also, to President Obama, Lord mentioned this, but President Obama and countless members of his administration have been deeply involved in this humanitarian.  Liar!  Effort to Secretary Clinton and the members of the State Department, several of whom are here, they have really put their hearts in this. 
[02:45:00]  It speaks well of our country that when two American citizens are in harm's way, that so many people would just put things aside and just go to work to make sure that this has had a happy ending.  Come on, put Bill on.  He just said happy ending.  We want Bill.  Put on Bill.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  You know, in their prayers, who have written letters and called and sent emails. 
[02:45:30]  Right.  We're very, very grateful to Steve Bing and all the folks who have made the flight possible.  We say a word.  Use your tongue, Bertie, or in a $20 hole.  Well, this has been an ordeal for them, but I want you all to know your families have been unbelievable, unbelievable.  Really?  Passionate, involved, committed, innovative.  You'll hear a lot of stories, and they're looking forward to hearing a lot of stories from you. 
[02:46:00]  That guy is so gay behind that one.  Oh, yeah.  He is so gay.  And Laurie, your mom's been making this special soup for two days now.  Oh, yeah.  Bill was making a special soup, too.  His parents.  Fucking Clinton bisque.  There is a good chance that that many days, that child's maybe two, that that child doesn't remember its mom.  Has no clue.  That's like, you know, a quarter.  A third of a year, you know what I mean?  So, yeah. 
[02:46:30]  A bit more than a third of a year.  Why is he still talking?  Does Clinton get to talk?  Thank you for coming out.  Let's go, Bill.  Does Bill talk?  Time for the head.  Come on, Bill.  If he doesn't say, hey.  There you have it.  There you have it.  There you have it.  What the fuck?  Are you shitting me?  What was Bill's deal?  He didn't want to talk?  I'm saying a word.  The former vice president referred to her there, that little girl.  Oh.  Are you kidding?  Why didn't Bill Clinton take the mic?  That is weird.  Why?  Why?  Oh, man.  Maybe he didn't have a speech prepared, because Al Gore was still here. 
[02:47:00]  He had speechwriters to work with.  Yeah, but he's an awful kind of guy.  I just said, yeah, I went over there and I'll say.  I want to thank some people.  All right.  That's it.  That's great.  Yeah, it's Mike Vickera out here on the south lawn, Dylan.  Hi, Mike.  Anything from the president yet?  No, we do expect him to be.  No, no.  Obama will be fighting today.  They've all got their arms around each other now.  They look like fucking.  This kind of shows up Obama.  It so shows up.  I don't know why Al Gore had to give him a little something something during his speech.  Oh, that was a little fucking kiss ass he had to give him, like he was involved. 
[02:47:30]  Shut up.  Because Obama looks a little.  Obama looks powerless and weak.  That's what he looks.  That's what they're going to say all day long.  That he needs Bill Clinton to fucking go over there and bail his ass out to get these two  journalists back.  Right, right, right.  That's what they're going to say.  Yeah, but in Obama's defense, he had to have a beer with that guy, why this was all going  on in the garden.  Right.  He had to drink a beer with fucking.  Well, his events don't organize themselves.  With the carpet.  Right, right.  The black professor guy was going through his window. 
[02:48:00]  He had a beer with Obama.  These girls were in a prison for 130-something days.  It's all the same.  It's all the same.  And he commented on that.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  I understand how America works.  We must look ridiculous in your dumb Aussie eyes.  I loved it when he went out, Obama did that thing, he threw the pitch, which I think is  a nice little tradition.  Dude, he's a nerd.  But he was wearing bad jeans, and it's like, who gives a fuck that he's bad jeans?  Yeah, but you know, he's supposed to be the young president.  He has got a lot of money, though. 
[02:48:30]  Just get him a pair of designer jeans.  How hard is it?  Get him some nice jeans.  I had more of a problem with the pitch.  Was it?  Oh, that he just lollygagged over.  High arcing pitch.  Was Bush a good pitcher?  Yeah, Bush was.  He owned a baseball team.  Yeah, Bush was an athlete.  You could tell him.  Look at these horrendous sneakers and jeans.  Can you see his cock in those pants?  Zoom in on there.  Zoom in.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow, he's barely black. 
[02:49:00]  He's got the white socks thing.  Why are teams called socks?  Why would anyone call a team after a pair of socks?  Red socks, white socks.  Is there something I'm missing?  I don't know.  What's a didgeridoo?  Well, a didgeridoo at least.  But a didgeridoo isn't two things.  Like, a socks isn't a, you know, a didgeridoo.  Okay, sure, it's a hollowed out bit of stick.  A hollowed out bit of stick.  A hollowed out bit of stick that really plays the one note over and over again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll put it out there. 
[02:49:30]  The aboriginals were never known for their music.  You know, they really had the hollowed out stick and the bashing the two sticks together.  It was their whole orchestra of sorts.  They were hoping to be the next Beatles.  Yeah.  Oldest civilization in the world.  And the rest of the world had violins and harps.  And, you know.  You know what the great thing about his stupid pitch was?  He raised the leg.  Horribly.  Without any use of it.  Like, pitchers raise their leg. 
[02:50:00]  There's a reason.  They're winding up.  And it actually makes a lever out of yourself, pretty much.  You're using that leg power and putting it into your arm.  He raised his leg, like, put it down and threw the ball.  And then waved, walked away.  He wanted to look so cool doing that.  He looked stupid.  He got it over the mat, though, didn't he?  Yeah.  With the strike.  Unlike, uh...  Oh, can you show them the other one?  Yeah, the best one ever.  Best, uh...  The best, worst fucking... 
[02:50:30]  I forgot who it was already.  So this is why we should have had Hillary.  Mayor of Cincinnati.  If Hillary did.  Mayor of Cincinnati, right.  Oh, that was an eerie sounding of a door.  Yeah, what the fuck was that?  That was fucking spooky, wasn't it?  That was the rock stomach.  Inner sanctum.  Here it is.  This guy is great as a first pitch.  All right.  Throwing out the first pitch guy.  Jim Jeffries in the studio today.  Okay.  Here he goes.  Mayor of Cincinnati.  He fucking...  He was like...  He thought the guy on first was stealing second, 
[02:51:00]  and he was doing a throw to first.  He probably threw it exactly in between home plate and first base.  It would probably, if you're looking at the plate,  it would be about 10 o'clock.  I would shit myself, though, if I had to do that.  If there was people watching, I'd be very nervous.  There's people watching.  Yeah.  And people, that's the most watched pitch.  Because there's that whole thing in your brain that you go,  I'm going to fuck this, aren't I?  You've got to be good.  Imagine nailing it, though.  Oh, yeah.  And I'm sure even that guy thought, 
[02:51:30]  I want to nail this, man.  I want it to go thwock into the catcher's glove.  Right.  Like a fucking perfect strike, and he throws it away.  I played a celebrity soccer match on television in Britain.  Oh, you're famous.  And it was...  They let you do all these celebrity things.  It was half celebrities, half ex-players, right?  Oh, okay.  And so I thought...  And also, some of the celebrities that were on our team were also like Olympians.  They just weren't soccer players.  Oh, shit.  Right, right, yeah.  And so we had like Linford Christie was on the fucking team. 
[02:52:00]  Still, they're...  Yeah, like the fastest man on earth.  And athletes, yeah.  Yeah, so he's going to have some type of skill.  And then fat, fucking smoke 40-a-day drinking guy from Australia.  How am I going to go?  And the few times I touched the ball, I thought,  oh, I'm doing all right.  I'm doing all right.  You think you do all right until you watch yourself back with commentary.  Oh, no.  What do they say?  Every time I got the ball, they go,  he just doesn't look like he can do this.  Oh, and then there was times...  There was times when I actually had the ball,  but the worst commentary was when nothing was happening 
[02:52:30]  and they zeroed in on my red fucking veiny face,  just ready to vomit, going,  someone has to take Jim Jeffries off.  He's going to vomit here on the pitch.  It just doesn't look well.  That's fucking funny.  Horrible.  Why don't we take a break?  Holy shit, that's funny.  Jim Jeffries in studio.  What are you promoting, Jim?  Well, my DVD of the HBO special comes out in October.  I swear to God.  Yeah, I swear to God it'll be coming out in October.  It's airing again in September. 
[02:53:00]  But until...  I'm going to be...  Caroline's in September is the next time I'm gigging in New York.  Oh, so we'll see you soon.  I'll be here soon, yeah.  I'm off to the Edinburgh Festival now.  If anyone's listening to it online or whatever,  I'm off to the Edinburgh Festival in a couple of days.  Dad, I swear to God, I was at the taping.  You had to be happy with the final product.  I'm pretty happy.  I haven't watched it really.  I've watched little bits and pieces.  I watched it.  It was terrific, man.  It came out all right, didn't it?  It definitely came out all right.  You got good reviews, too.  Did it?  I've never read any reviews.  Yeah, there was a review in the paper here in New York, I think,  and they gave you some nice props there for the iSweary.com. 
[02:53:30]  It didn't rank that well, but it had no dropout at the 15-minute mark,  which was, they reckon, the big important thing.  Dropout at five minutes, outrageous.  Oh, although...  Really?  You know, that was the only thing that HBO told me.  God bless HBO.  I think they're the most wonderful company in the world.  This is why I love them so much,  is the only rule they gave me on censorship,  they just said, don't say cunt for 12 minutes.  Oh, really?  You can see it like 12 minutes 30 of those things. 
[02:54:00]  You couldn't hold back anyway.  All right, we're each time.  Look, look.  Now Obama's going to talk.  Clinton didn't say a word.  I want to just make a brief comment about the fact that the two young journalists,  Una Lee and Laura Ling, are safely back with their families.  Yeah, we saw Bill Clinton brought them back.  Extraordinarily relieved.  I had an opportunity to speak with the families yesterday.  Did you?  Once we knew that they were on the plane. 
[02:54:30]  The reunion that we've all seen on television,  I think, is a source of happiness, not only for the families, but for the entire country.  I want to thank President Bill Clinton.  I had a chance to talk to him for the extraordinary humanitarian effort that resulted in the release of the two journalists.  I want to thank Vice President Al Gore, who worked tirelessly in order to... 
[02:55:00]  The administration that was in there fucking liked about nine years ago.  Does he still have to be called Vice President?  Yeah.  Yeah, presidents are always called presidents.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Not only is this White House obviously extraordinarily happy, but all Americans should be grateful to both former President Clinton and Vice President Gore for their extraordinary work.  What's going on in his head right now, do you think?  He's like, I look so bad.  Oh my God.  The families that have been reunited can enjoy the next several days and weeks. 
[02:55:30]  Understanding that...  There'll never be...  Listen to the birds tweeting in the background over there.  President Clinton and Gore.  Nice place.  They are able to...  Is he just out in the lawn of the White House?  Yeah.  Why is he doing it in the lawn?  Why not in the room?  I don't know.  You can see the kids' playground in the back.  I'm hopeful that the families are going to be able to get some good time together in the next few days.  Well, that was awesome coffee. 
[02:56:00]  How useless do you feel, Mr. President?  Mr. President, how come you had to have the ex-president?  Reverend Jackson.  That helicopter's there just all the time waiting.  Just in case.  I like him to a certain degree, right?  But the thing that I really miss about Bush is I kind of liked how Bush made every speech sound like it was off the cuff, even if it wasn't.  He always just sounds too rehearsed.  I always liked when Bush would do that. 
[02:56:30]  When he'd lean on the podium, he would just kind of lean on the podium and look at the report.  Letterman always does this thing where they go,  this is cool and this is uncool.  So they show something like Obama playing pool,  and then they show Bush doing something dicky.  I don't care what you say.  I would rather get drunk with George Bush any day of the week before Obama.  I just think he sounds like a fun guy.  Yeah.  Probably a pisser.  Probably got a bunch of bad, like, racist jokes.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, a lot of stuff. 
[02:57:00]  I think he's got a lot of things that start with the sentence, lean in.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Got me a lean in.  Oh, now what is Jesse Jackson saying about, you know, I'm tired.  On MSNBC.  They got Jesse Jackson talking.  Because he went to some fucking country once and brought someone home.  I'd like to see Reverend Al do that.  Oh, yeah.  There you go, Reverend.  There's a real thing you could have done.  Send him somewhere where they put him in a big, giant pot and cook him. 
[02:57:30]  That's what I would like to see.  We're going to take a break.  Jim Jeffries in studio, and we're going to see what you've been up to, my friend.  All right.  Do you remember when we fucked with you on the phone?  I want to ask you about that.  The phone was cutting in and out.  I had a lot of people write to me saying what cunts you were to me,  but I'm all right with it.  Well, now we're going to play it so you can hear what we were doing on this side.  No, no, no.  No, we're going to have to find that out for after the break.  I actually was telling you one of the funniest fucking stories ever,  but it didn't work.  We really fucked with you to the point you're like,  wow, I don't think these guys like us anymore, like me anymore. 
[02:58:00]  And also we got a voicemail from Jim Norton.  Oh, we got to hear that.  Who officially got a gig with Jay Leno.  He's not leaving the show.  I'm sure in this voicemail he's probably discussing that.  No, he will, you know, every so often have to wing out there, I guess,  and do something.  Yeah, and do some stuff for Jay.  That's huge for Jimmy.  We're really happy for him.  Don't worry, I always come here every four months.  Yeah.  So you'll have a spot filled.  Yeah.  It'll be fun.  Where the hell is he going?  God, you people don't even know.  What are you talking about?  They're firing up the helicopter. 
[02:58:30]  Well, because he's done talking, so now the helicopter leaves.  Yeah.  That's all.  What you do is you have a speech and you go off in your helicopter.  He's like one of the Thunderbirds.  Did he just get there?  No, it's just like a safety thing, I guess.  No way.  He ain't like on that.  But why was the helicopter there?  Safety.  No, he's at the White House.  But he might be off to something right away.  Yeah, but I didn't see him get in.  Off to hide.  Oh, he loves traveling.  Wherever.  Can we take our breath now, please? 
[02:59:00]  Oh, yeah.  Let's do that.  I'm going to pee my pants.  All right.  Go wee me.  Talking to Jim Jeffries today and just learned that he has officially moved to the United  States of America, living in the L.A. area.  For the people out there, it's Venice Beach.  I'm living on Venice Beach, yeah.  And you said that the homeless go through your garbage every night?  The homeless fucking do my head in.  They're going through my garbage every single day.  I put all my bottles and cans, and I've even written a note and put it on the bin to 
[02:59:30]  say that there'll be no cans in there.  I don't mind giving it to them.  I just don't want them going through my shit.  They can't read.  Yeah, that's true.  We've got this one guy who sleeps, because I live there with another comedian.  We've got this one guy who sleeps on the front step, but he likes to have afternoon  naps.  Now, I have no problems with him sleeping on the step, but he's on the property, sleeping  on the step, and then if I come into the house at, say, two in the afternoon, and  I'm talking at Lally or playing video games, he'll look in the window and tell me 
[03:00:00]  to shut the fuck up.  He's trying to sleep.  All right.  No way.  That's fucking...  Right?  That's how you get your head stomped.  And I'm just there, but I'm slightly scared of him, because, you know, like, I don't  know if they're going to...  So I just sort of go, sorry, mate.  I'm kind of...  Because it's...  Sorry?  It's like, I live here, motherfucker.  No, but it's just...  It's just...  They're homeless for a reason.  They stab someone at work, or something's happened.  You know what I mean?  They're not homeless by accident.  My mate who I live with, Eddie, we had...  Two of them were punching the shit out of each other, like, outside, just fucking 
[03:00:30]  fucking...  This went off for like 20 minutes, and I'm just sitting in my room laughing, and Eddie  gets up eventually and just goes, fuck this.  He rings the emergency hotline and goes, I think I have an emergency.  And they go, what is it?  And he goes, well, there's two people punching the hell out of each other outside.  And then he goes, why do you think it's an emergency?  And he goes, well, they're both homeless, right?  And then she sort of just went, oh, we'll just see if they stopped, right?  Like, it's...  Of course.  It's two regular people punching each other up. 
[03:01:00]  It's like...  No one really cares.  Nah, not really.  They don't care about themselves.  About the homeless.  Why do we have to care?  We got Karen from PA that's been waiting, wow, over an hour.  Karen.  I'm here.  All right.  Why are you on the phones?  I think I'm forgetting now, but I called in because I was talking about how obsessed  my husband is with your show.  Every day he comes home with some new bizarre news that he hears.  I'm always thinking to myself, I always get my news from a reputable source, like, I don't  know, the paper, panel six.  Yeah. 
[03:01:30]  My husband?  No, opening Anthony's show.  We give you the reputable news in a fun way.  And I heard what you were saying there.  That was a bit hurtful.  I heard what you were saying there.  Trust me.  We are way smarter than the stupid newspaper and most media outlets.  I guarantee you that.  And without censorship.  Right.  Yes.  Oh, okay.  So you could get your news from, I don't know, the paper.  You could wipe your ass with the paper.  The paper sucks a big, fat fucking dick.  My husband told me that if I got screwed on the air, he said, we're probably going to 
[03:02:00]  put the sound noise from the ghost fellows when he tells you to go get your effing shine  box.  I'm like, oh, I hope not.  I was like, what happened to this thing?  I was like, that means you stink.  I'm like, oh, okay.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  Yeah, my son here, he is nine months old.  I'm staying here.  I took a year off from work.  Oh, but we were about to hear that she's had a baby.  See, and I took a month off from work.  You know where that story was going?  Yeah.  Absolutely nowhere. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Nowhere.  I get the news, you know, I don't know, from the paper.  I hate.  From, you know, let me think.  Oh, the paper.  Yeah, we got the sarcasm.  I hate mums.  Good for you.  That's when you officially become a cunt, is when you're a mum.  Because before that, you can be a fun type of girl who is a bit of a laugh, you can drink  with or whatever.  But as soon as you become a mum, you start telling people not to touch flames and stuff  and to stay away from bad people and all that.  And that's when you become a pretentious dickhead. 
[03:03:00]  You're right.  It is.  I think I got to agree with you.  And then, see, this is the weird thing.  In my audience, I always like people who are in their sort of 20s, early 30s, or in their  50 and up.  When the kids have grown up and left the house, people become cool again.  Yeah, yeah.  Then they want to party a little more.  Yeah, then they're just like, ah, my kids are gone.  Get the last blast out of the way before the old pine box.  But fucking mums, they think they've done something special by having a child.  Everyone's done it.  Not me, I've never done it. 
[03:03:30]  Then they're so used to having to have that responsibility and constantly trailing some  fucking little shitty ass they got to wipe or feed or do something like that, that everyone  in their life becomes that.  Do you have mums' car spots in this country?  What?  In Britain, they have car spots for women with prams.  Oh, really?  Oh.  You should say, you know when you park in like a disabled spot and people get a bit  grumpy at you?  Yeah.  You watch the mums when you park in that fucking pram spot.  Really? 
[03:04:00]  And the symbol is just a picture of a pram.  Yeah.  And it's just like, this spot's for mums.  It's for mums.  Fuck you.  A picture of a what?  A pram, like a cart that you push kids around in.  What do you call it?  Carriage, a stroller.  A pram, like a baby's pram.  Shopping cart.  No, what do you carry a child?  What the hell is a pram?  Yeah, kid.  Fuck you.  I don't know what a pram is.  It's like a stroller.  You've heard the word pram before?  A stroller.  Yeah.  Yeah, a pram.  All right.  I thought it was one of those words that we don't have over here.  Well, we don't.  We don't use pram.  I really don't know the word pram. 
[03:04:30]  There you go.  There's a pram.  That's a picture.  Wait, so...  That's a picture.  There you go.  That's old school, like, fucking...  It's fucking England, mate.  That's like a horrible...  Do they still push them around in, like, things like that?  Get out of here.  That's old school.  That's seriously what you get pushed around in your baby.  That's what you see at the top of the stairs, that they push.  You get a bit of that.  That's rubber baby buggy bumpers.  There you go.  Very good.  They still have the pram as well.  We got someone that wants to defend the mums.  Who's this?  Kirsten. 
[03:05:00]  All right.  All right.  What's that?  How's it going?  Are you a bum?  I am a mum.  I have two little babies, and I can be fun as hell.  Yeah?  You can be fun as hell.  Of course you can.  You're fistable now.  So...  Oh, my God.  That added your fun ratio up by 10.  Oh, my God.  I never thought of it that way before.  Holy shit.  You're fistable.  Holy shit.  I've never thought of that before.  Ouch.  Wow.  So what do you do for fun? 
[03:05:30]  What do you consider fun?  Well, I like to go party with my friends who are younger, and I can have just as much fun,  if not more fun, with them, because I have life experience.  But what about when the babysitter's time runs out?  Yeah.  Well, see, that's when you have, you know, somebody who will stay longer for you, so you can stay  out as long as you want.  Are you a single mum?  Yeah.  No, I'm married.  Oh, yeah.  You sound like a lot of fun.  There could be a lot.  With your husband and your baby at home.  Oh, stop it. 
[03:06:00]  Stop it.  You're turning me on.  You sound outrageously fun.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's pop you a pill and see how we go.  Come on.  Let's do the whole night.  Let's dab some M&A powder on your tongue and party away.  Hey, there's a lot of fun coming from this phone call.  You guys just relax.  I know.  I don't understand fun.  A lot of fun.  This is a lot of fun.  What do you do for fun?  Like, you haven't even mentioned one thing.  Yeah.  Well, I think, you know, it just all depends on what's going on, but.  All right.  How about this?  Jim Jeffries. 
[03:06:30]  What do you do for fun?  Go.  Well, see, it depends.  I have to stand on her argument as well.  So this last weekend, I was at a music festival with Mud up to my knees doing comedy whilst  taking ecstasy all day and hanging out with the Arctic Monkeys.  So can you beat that?  There you go.  Now, what do you do for fun?  Okay.  So I can't beat Jim Jeffries.  They had sex with a stripper at Lace Club on the way back who noticed me off my HBO special.  Come on.  I'm so much more funner than you.  See?  Fun. 
[03:07:00]  Fun.  Fun this weekend.  Drove very fast in my car.  I bought a brand new pistol.  And then me and Danny went to a strip club Sunday night and watched a bunch of black strippers  with bubble butts.  Fun.  And he videotaped him driving very fast in his car.  Yeah, yeah.  Fun.  So he could prove it.  He endangered his life.  See?  We don't have kids.  We don't care about our lives.  Exactly.  We don't mean anything to us.  No.  So what do you do for fun?  Okay.  So one thing you have to understand is I risk my life on a daily basis at my job.  So risking my life is no fun for me. 
[03:07:30]  What's your job?  What do you do?  I'm a psychiatric nurse on a walk away.  Oh.  A psychiatric nurse.  That's not risking your life.  No.  There are big bruises there that'll fucking grab you.  Yeah.  One guy who shoves a syringe to your neck.  I've seen movies.  Movies.  But that doesn't happen every day.  In the movies it's dangerous.  And like the Terminator.  Right.  It's dangerous.  What?  The Indian's going to throw the water tank through the window.  Oh.  Sorry.  I have to bust this up for a second.  Oh.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  No.  Jim.  What do you think of this? 
[03:08:00]  What?  Which one?  The top or the bottom?  The top.  What do you think of that?  Okay.  Who is this woman?  Just tell us.  Just what do you think?  Her name's Wendy Williams.  It used to be a man.  Is that a man?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Is that one of those things?  Thank you.  You know what?  She's not.  She's a fucking monster.  I can't stand her.  But she comes out and thinks she is the sexiest fucking thing.  Yeah.  And I can't understand that.  Look at her calves.  The thighs.  That's the big problem.  There's some thighs. 
[03:08:30]  It looks like a tranny.  She's a wreck.  How you done?  I'll never understand.  Where's our how you done?  How you done?  My touch.  Does she have one of those voices as well?  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  Have we got any more fun?  Okay.  So, Vanessa, I understand that, first of all, one of your girls is missing today.  Yeah.  She's Kalisha.  Kalisha.  She's on six.  And so tell me why you decided to come in a gang rush.  Hi, Kalisha.  Feel better.  A gang rush.  Hi.  Hi.  Well, normally we are from, as you said, we're from Neptune, New Jersey. 
[03:09:00]  And, you know, since you're a...  Thank you for hanging up on that friggin' TV show, too.  Have we got more mums ringing and abusing us?  I'm sure there has been.  I don't want to hear from any more of them.  When you say, I have fun, but then can't back it up with anything.  Yeah.  Then they can't...  They just can't back it up.  No, but she...  Did she use life experience?  I have a life experience.  I have fun because life experience is what stopped me from having fun at certain times.  That's anti-fun.  Life experience is the thing that goes, don't get in the car with that bloke.  Exactly. 
[03:09:30]  And that guy can be fun.  I remember once I got in a car with someone like this and I was petrified and they, like,  almost killed me.  So that life experience...  I won't do that.  That's not fun.  I remember being, like, 18 and waking up on the other side of Sydney, like, on a beach  with these people I'd never met, like, next to some...  And, like, I would not do that at this age.  I'd be like, I'm not traveling there with you on an adventure.  But those life experiences are fun.  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.  It's like, name something fun you did.  I can tell you something for sure. 
[03:10:00]  My mum's never had any fun.  Yeah.  Nor will she have any fun in the future.  Even when she recalls fun that she used to have at certain...  My dad's had some fun.  My dad's still up for...  I tell you what.  When my mum was almost...  Well, I was terminally ill, but she actually got through it, so I guess it wasn't terminal.  So my dad was already out with me in Britain, visiting, trying to get hookers.  Wow.  My mum was still alive and sick in hospital, and he's still married to her.  It's not like they're divorced.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  My old man...  Karen's calling back. 
[03:10:30]  She got hung up.  Oh, here we go.  That's great.  Hold on, man.  That's classic.  Why aren't you off having fun?  Yeah, Karen, what happened?  Hey, I thought we got disconnected.  I'm not sure what happened.  Oh.  Oh, fun me to die.  So you risk your...  So you work in a mental institution.  Yeah.  No, I don't work in a mental institution.  Hey, I'm a glutton for punishment.  What can I say?  What do you do then?  What do you do for a job if you don't work in a mental institution?  I'm actually a CPA.  You're an accountant.  Yeah.  You're an accountant.  You're a mother with a husband who's an accountant who said to us that she risks her life every 
[03:11:00]  day.  What?  Fucking with numbers.  Hemorrhaging.  Yes.  Unfortunately, I have to admit that I do.  All right.  And what's...  Holy shit.  No fun?  No fun?  You've actually rung us up and become more boring than when we hung up on you.  Yeah.  That's unbelievable.  We didn't think...  Once again, Karen.  Well, you know what, though?  I got an hour of your show while I was on hold.  I have to say, this is pretty funny stuff.  I never heard it because I don't have...  Oh, see? 
[03:11:30]  Thank you.  And you don't have to have fun.  Too busy watching Barney the dinosaur.  Well, the...  Oh, wait.  Is this the other one with the news from the newspaper?  What?  You get your news from the newspaper?  Oh, maybe that's...  No, no, no.  That's the one before.  This is the lady who said she was the psychiatrist who had more fun.  And if she wanted to stay out all night, she'd just make the babysitter.  I have all kinds of stories, but I'm going to count.  I mean, come on.  How much can I report?  Yeah, but why would you ring up and...  How about you tell us one story?  You've got all sorts.  We'll take one.  Give us the funnest night of your life. 
[03:12:00]  The funnest night of my life?  Non-work-related?  Definitely.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding?  That proves you don't have fun ever, that you have to...  Wait, so non-work-related fun?  Because let me tell you about some accounting.  Let me tell you what happens at work.  Fun.  Are you fucking kidding me?  There was this guy, and this guy brought in a tax return, but it was for a different country.  Get the fuck out of here.  And we went, you can't do that.  And then I high-fived the other accountant.  Good times. 
[03:12:30]  Oh, somebody asking here to ask you about Miranda Kerr.  You know Miranda Kerr?  She's Australian.  She's a model.  Maybe he knows Gemma Atkinson.  No, I don't know her.  You know Gemma Atkinson?  I know Gemma Atkinson, yeah.  We were looking at her yesterday, and rumor has it, listen to this one, that not only is  she hot, she's blown half a soccer team.  Oh.  And they said, I swear, half a soccer team.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So how many guys are on a soccer team? 
[03:13:00]  She's the British one, isn't she, that used to go out with the guy, the striker from Liverpool  who played for the team, the big lanky guy, on a soccer team, you know, 11 people and  a goalie, you know.  But she, yeah, she's fucked a lot of people.  There's another one in Australia who's a model who started fucking all the Aussie rules guys  and got to the extent where this team, they started hating each other because they all  got jealous, right?  Oh, wow.  And there's people losing wives and stuff.  She's like the Yoko Ono of the fucking soccer world. 
[03:13:30]  Holy shit, yeah, punch up Miranda Kerr.  Yeah.  And I'm sure it's your pleasure to do it.  Is she lovely?  Yeah.  She sounds lovely, but she has fun.  She's Australian.  See, a girl who blows half a soccer team, there's a girl who has fun.  That's fun.  That's fun.  Whether you morally agree with it or not, fun.  This chick right here, Orlando Bloom, turned down the latest, Orlando Bloom is fucking 
[03:14:00]  her.  Yeah.  Turned down the latest Pirates of the Caribbean sequel.  Right.  Because he doesn't want to leave her.  Right.  Because he knows she would just fucking be gone in a second.  Get a better picture.  No, she's lovely.  That's the picture.  No, no, I know that's a really good picture.  The top is picture with the pink bottom on.  But you gotta see, like, the whole body.  Yeah, yeah, no.  She's lovely.  I like, like, legs and ass and shit like that.  She's lovely.  She is, uh, really, really hot. 
[03:14:30]  Oh.  Yeah, look at, look at, look at that.  Look at this.  Oh.  Stop it, right?  And, and with the added thing that she's a bit of a slut.  It's, it's, it's, no, she, she's not.  No, she hasn't been a soccer fucker.  Oh, no, she's respectful, this one.  Yeah.  Well, she's fucking Orlando Bloom.  Yeah, and he's a bit of a div, isn't he?  You know.  But, and he's not even doing the movie now because he's looking at that going, if I leave  her side for a second, the vultures will swoop in and fuck her.  Why doesn't he just pay for her to come to the set?  She's a model.  She's probably good.  She's got her own thing.  She's probably got a whole.  She's following him around like a puppy dog. 
[03:15:00]  She's got her own life.  I've heard about these girls who have their own lives.  Yeah.  Yeah, right?  Fuck.  Hey, we've got a 48 live wire on the phone.  All right.  Let's hear it from Sandy in Rochester.  Look at that.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey.  I'm not 48.  I'm 46.  That's kind of a big deal.  All right.  All right.  46.  Does that mean you still get periods?  What happens?  There you go.  I listen to you guys all the time on the road.  You guys keep me awake. 
[03:15:30]  And I just, some of the women that call in are just absolutely insane or they're just totally  ignorant.  And no wonder you guys take more calls from men than you do women.  Wow.  I totally agree about this, being young and free and being a lot more fun when you're  young.  I have kids.  I know.  But my kids are grown now.  And so I'm getting out and having more fun now because I can't.  That's what I was saying before.  You can start having fun again after your kids grow up.  Oh, my God.  It's amazing.  What do you do to have fun?  Well, I hope nobody recognizes my voice. 
[03:16:00]  I mean, I go out now, I do a lot of partying, you know, and we enjoy like not wholesome  fun, but drinking, jet skiing, water skiing, snow skiing, and.  She did sound funnier than the other ladies, though.  A little more fun on that one.  Well, at least she's active.  A little bit.  A little bit.  She's not my type of fun because she's active sports fun.  There's like, there's these gigs in the French Alps that I can do, right?  That pay reasonably well. 
[03:16:30]  And every year they ask me to do them, but I just don't want to stand on top of a big  snowy hill.  So I don't go and do them.  It's just not my type of fun.  You don't like snow?  I can't ski.  I hate the cold.  I hate the cold.  Oh, my God.  What's wrong with you guys?  I don't want to be cold.  I don't want to be wet.  Why the fuck am I here?  Yeah.  You can wear stuff where you're not cold.  Eh.  Oh, look.  Yeah, but I don't know.  I'm still cold.  Oh, shit.  It's the big dog out of Never Ending Story. 
[03:17:00]  Never Ending Story.  Looks just like Wendy Williams.  Like Wendy Williams.  I don't even know.  It's not a dog, was it?  It's something else.  Yeah, it's Falcor.  Whatever it is.  Hey, we got the Jim Norton voicemail.  I want to hear this.  I want to know what Jeannie's up to.  Hey, it's me.  I'm on the set right now.  We are rehearsing a scene with a port-a-potty.  I'm in and Patrice is in and Brooke Shields is in and two other guys are in.  And it's good.  I have to open a port-a-potty door.  I overslept today. 
[03:17:30]  I feel like an asshole.  I was supposed to get up and have a 7.20 pickup.  I thought it was 7.30.  And there's no fucking worse feeling than being down, like, out of a hotel with your fucking  saggity suitcases.  You feel like little things in it.  And the van is gone.  And I just made a lot of worse feelings.  And I've paid for most of them.  Paid for most of them.  I didn't talk.  Poor Jim.  He sounds a little shell-shocked.  Yeah, he doesn't sound like he's been having a good day. 
[03:18:00]  No.  He's making a movie.  Yeah, I know.  How couldn't you have a good day?  Have fun, Jimmy.  That's the best thing in the world.  I want to make a movie so bad.  You will.  I'm auditioning for Scrubs today.  For real?  Yeah.  That's what I'm doing after this.  Hey, that's pretty cool.  I'm going to audition for Scrubs.  Is Scrubs still happening?  Exactly.  That's what I said.  Anytime you get an audition where you go, is it still on?  Scrubs is one of those shows I used to watch.  And then you just kind of tap out.  Then occasionally you get an episode here and there.  But is it still doing well in the ratings?  It must be, right?  I think it moved channels. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah, it's not really doing very good anymore.  Did you like Scrubs?  In a T-Day or whatever?  It had some episodes I liked.  I didn't like the ones where they got a little too sappy.  Yeah, and some of them they did get fucking sappy.  All right, it's comedy.  Shut up.  I've auditioned for a lot of movies in L.A.  And I find the whole idea of auditioning,  they always say you can use your own accent,  but they never want it.  They really want me to be American.  And my American accent's not great, and that's my problem. 
[03:19:00]  But is it good?  It's all right.  It's passable, but I'm not funny.  Let's hear it.  No, it's like, hey, how you going, man?  Like, whoa.  I can't fucking do it.  That's funny.  No, that's really good.  I can do Southern accent, but I'm just impersonating Dr. Phil voice.  That whole, if he rapes you, he doesn't love you,  you need to find a man.  That one.  Oh, yeah.  That's what he's got to do.  See, you just do that whole deep and thing, and the whole thing.  Anyway, it might be shit, but it's way better than your Australian accents.  You can do a Hank Hill then, huh? 
[03:19:30]  Hank Hill's a, hey there, Bobby.  That's enough.  My Homer Simpson's good, so if I can do every character as Homer Simpson.  I like your Homer.  I don't have anything to say as Homer Simpson.  Quick line.  I don't have anything to say.  We looked you on the opening Anthony show.  That's good.  All right, here we go.  We got Brent in Cincinnati.  Brent.  How are you doing, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  I have to say that there are some, I'll say, mothers out there that can be fun, 
[03:20:00]  but if they're going to be fun, they're going to be sneaky as hell.  I was like 22, went to a bar with a couple guys,  picked up a couple Cougars that said they were like 27.  We got wasted just doing some Jager bombs and whatnot.  They take us back to their place.  Ended up just nailing both of them.  It was awesome.  It's like 5 in the morning we get out.  They're like, yeah, we'll take you home.  They got a soccer mom sticker on the back of their car.  I'm like, hey, whoa, what's going on?  Hand me your business card.  She goes, yeah, my husband works for the late shift.  Give me a call sometime. 
[03:20:30]  I'm like, oh, great.  She's got like two baby seats in the back trunk.  It was just a mess.  Yeah.  No.  I've done a thing where you Shagerbird after a gig,  and then you wake up and there's some kid having breakfast in the house.  Oh, jeez.  No, you did that?  Yeah, many times.  Wow.  Many times you're just like, oh, no, I don't feel like that.  Oh, what am I doing?  Yeah, I feel like a fucking star.  I'm a motherfucker.  Like my friends have told me.  I've done one where I, this is just, this is in Dallas. 
[03:21:00]  I won't say her.  But there was this girl and her husband brought her to the gig,  and then she convinced him to go home.  Then I get her back at the hotel room.  Oh, God.  And then she's done this, I've got to get home.  And I'm like, why don't you stay?  Hey, why don't you stay?  And then she's like, oh, no, my husband actually brought me the gig.  Yeah, but.  That's horrible.  Horrible.  Wow.  Even I feel morally bad.  Yeah.  Things like that.  And it's not my doing.  Like, what do you think the guy's thinking?  Yeah.  Does he think that, like, well, she's just hanging out, 
[03:21:30]  or she's fucking someone, or what?  I don't trust women.  I feel they're evil.  I think when men cheat, that whole idea that we brag to all of our friends  and all that, I really think that they do it.  They just go in, do it.  They don't tell a single soul.  Just complete self-satisfaction.  Complete self-satisfaction.  They don't even tell their best friend.  They just do it in and out, and they forget that they even did it.  Where men are stupid, and we just tell everyone.  That's twisted.  Dude, let me tell you something.  Just keep your mouth shut.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't say anything.  Don't say anything to anybody.  I know you're my brother-in-law. 
[03:22:00]  I know you are.  Let's get a Mary in Missouri.  Mary.  Mary.  Okay.  Mary.  What do I do for fun?  Yeah.  I tell you what, you fuckers have got...  My old man, right?  He's from New York.  Same right here to Missouri.  Got me hooked on you guys, and I don't agree with half the shit you say.  So you agree with everything?  That's cool.  Yeah.  Thanks.  Thank you.  No, I know how to have fun. 
[03:22:30]  We stay home, smoke weed, and listen to you guys.  Yeah.  That's a lot of fun.  It's not fun.  It's fun.  And I don't care if you agree with us.  Some radio shows really do care about that.  They spew their shit and just really care if you don't agree with them.  And I also don't care...  We just throw our shit out there to maybe make you think a little.  I don't care if you don't have fun.  Yeah.  I prefer most of the world doesn't have fun.  That's what my problem is with fucking New Year's.  Every time I go out for New Year's, amateurs everywhere. 
[03:23:00]  Trying to have fun.  Clogging the space up.  Trying to have fun.  And not.  Getting in the way.  We got to play the...  You're so fucking right.  People have real fun never getting into fights.  That's true.  You know what I mean?  People have real fun.  Having fun.  Why?  I don't want to fight.  Yeah, yeah.  People who punch each other.  They're trying to have fun.  We're going to play Eat That Watermelon to break in a second here.  All right.  But first we got Jay.  Jay?  Hey, you know, it's not like when you talk about the walk of shame.  When you have to get up in the morning and walk out of the bedroom,  there's kids sitting on the couch. 
[03:23:30]  There's kids at the table.  It's just an awful feeling.  It makes you feel like shit.  What do you think the kids are thinking?  It depends.  If it just happens once or twice,  they would probably not think anything if they're too young.  They probably wouldn't even catch a hold of it.  If it happens all the time, yeah, I think it's, yeah, it depends.  I don't know.  I always feel icky when I see the kids there.  And when they get to the age,  if you've ever done it when the kid's like 10 and up,  the kid knows.  The look of contempt.  He knows.  Just that.  Just wants to slit your throat.  Just that whole look of you better be my dad or get out of here. 
[03:24:00]  The worst is actually when you're done having sex,  you come out and the parents are sitting having breakfast.  I'm like train spotty.  Guys, Mary.  I was implying that you were with the child.  When it, when it, when it.  Well, I've also done that one where you shag a girl  and then you wake up and then they're getting you out of the house  and they're like, oh, just quiet because my mom and dad,  they live at home.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But they're like those really liberal parents where it's like,  hey, if you're going to do drugs or drinks or bring boys home, 
[03:24:30]  I'd rather you do it under my roof where I know.  You know those parents?  Those parents are fucked, right?  Do it here because we have a relationship like,  not just your parents, we're your friends.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, really?  And what father could really deal with that in the end  where this little girl is just banging away in the basement?  This is Tyrone, dad.  They do it.  And then you meet the cool dads always like,  hey, you know, come and have breakfast.  Cindy hides nothing from us.  Yeah.  Right?  And he's like, oh.  So tight pussy, huh? 
[03:25:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It's a little uncomfortable.  How do you relax as a father knowing your little girl  is getting banged in the basement  because you have an open relationship with her?  You're eating sausage in the morning.  She's got something in her mouth.  Dad's pointing, going, huh, right?  Right?  There should be an element of shame with a few things you do in your life.  Yes.  There should be.  It's a part of growing up.  Yes.  Guys, Mary's calling back because she wasn't,  what the fuck is, I don't know.  The animals got gay guys on.  It gives you the insight, like, it makes you leave home eventually. 
[03:25:30]  You know those weird people who just never leave home?  Yeah, yeah.  They're fucking, ugh.  All right, Mary.  Mary's back.  Mary, Mary.  What happened to you?  What happened to me?  You guys always cry around.  You don't have some listeners.  You alienate them.  We don't alienate you.  Yeah, what was your story?  I forgot.  You know what?  Unless we're talking about our tits and all the stupid shit we do to guys,  you guys totally fucking ignore us.  So what do your tits look like?  What?  My tits?  Oh, fuck.  I'm Native American.  And they're saggy. 
[03:26:00]  They're made for.  I never heard this about the Native Americans.  When was that ever the same?  They're saggy?  Oh, yeah.  Were you called Big Wolf Low Tits or something?  What was their last name?  She with droopy nipples.  She with droopy nipples.  Don't worry.  I'm going to try to get you behind this barn.  What?  Get under.  No, I'm your typical.  You guys think that your listening audience is like all these East Coast people.  No, we listen to you guys all the time. 
[03:26:30]  We don't think we're just an East Coast show.  Very big in Cleveland.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, yeah, yeah.  Hey, yeah, yeah.  Ask a how.  What?  Making Indian jokes.  Don't worry about it.  Hi, Mary.  Are you done now?  We don't want you mad  Yeah  Okay I'm done now  I will be calling back  Believe that  We can't wait  Sorry about the whole  Taking your country thing  Yeah  Oh you know what  That's quite alright  That's alright  I forgive y'all  Because we found marijuana  So that's good 
[03:27:00]  We'd have a whole country  Of saggy tits apparently  According to her  So fuck it  I never heard this theory  Is this a proper theory  Is it because that  You know  You gotta thank us westerners  For the bras  The bra yeah  Before that  You guys weren't wearing bras  Like in the movies  Pocahontas always looked like  She had really perky  Yeah yeah  Tits the cartoon  Apparently not  Well she was 14  Oh yeah  That was a problem  She would have been nice  Is she still talking  She's just going  Wow  This is how the deal was going  With the America  With the United States  American government
