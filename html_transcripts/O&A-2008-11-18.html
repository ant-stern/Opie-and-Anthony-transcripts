<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts recounting Anthony's exhausting trip to Philadelphia, punctuated by humorous anecdotes about encountering a homeless man eating a bagel on a Penn Station escalator and a young man attempting a cell phone scam.  This segued into a discussion about helping those perceived as less capable, expressing frustration with societal tendencies towards "saving idiots."  The conversation dramatically shifted to the recent firing of long-time engineer Steve Freed, provoking a heated, expletive-laden rant against what they perceived as unfair treatment.  They vehemently countered Howard Stern's alleged accusations that they were responsible for the negative atmosphere at the company post-departure, blaming instead the declining radio industry and overall economy.  They also discussed other firings at Sirius and CBS.  The hosts then offered their opinions on Clay Aiken and Wanda Sykes coming out, placing it within the context of the California Proposition 8 debate, sharing their views on homosexuality,  and the implications of the Proposition 8 vote.  They briefly touched upon a Daily News article criticizing the "Today Show" and a PBS documentary on the Kennedy assassination's impact on television news.  The segment concluded with listener calls and a mention of Dennis Leary's upcoming book signing.

The following segment included political commentary speculating on Hillary Clinton and Madeleine Albright's perceived strengths and attractiveness, along with a discussion of Obama's 60 Minutes interview and the racial disparity in his voter base. Opie shared personal anecdotes about his interactions with Black individuals, one positive and one negative, framing it as an informal experiment. Jimmy also discussed his own social interactions.  The hosts then discussed the hijacking of a Saudi oil tanker by Somalian pirates, speculating on their motives and potential responses from international forces, punctuated by jokes about the pirates' lack of sophistication.  Caller input offered suggestions for countering pirate attacks.  The bulk of the segment was devoted to an interview with Dennis Leary, promoting his new book, *Why We Suck*.  They discussed CBGB's, the controversies surrounding the book (especially the chapter on autism, which Leary clarified as criticizing inattentive parents, not autistic children), negative press coverage (particularly from the New York Post), provocative chapter titles ("Please Drug Your Children," "We'd Hate You Even If You Weren't Black," "Matt Dillon's a Big Fag"), Leary's childhood and family, his views on parenting, and his book's place on bestseller lists.  Matt from the NYPD called in with anecdotes about post-Obama election reactions from crack addicts. Another caller discussed private military contracting in relation to anti-piracy efforts.  The segment was rife with crude humor and offensive language.

The next segment featured more of the Dennis Leary interview.  Leary shared funny anecdotes about his mother's reactions to his work and surprisingly positive views on Ozzy Osbourne and *Pimp My Ride*. He also discussed the writing process for his book, the upcoming season of *Rescue Me* (including Michael J. Fox's guest appearance), and his struggles with writer's block.  The conversation turned to Obama, Leary's support for him, and the challenges facing his administration. They debated taxes and wealth distribution, expressing differing opinions on the fairness of the tax system.  A humorous, crude discussion ensued about Leary's struggles with pornography during the writing process, and the hosts speculated about their possible contribution to David Duchovny's sex addiction treatment.  The California wildfires, specifically the destruction of Christopher Lloyd's home and the loss of his *Back to the Future* memorabilia, became a topic, followed by more off-color jokes, listener calls, and discussion about cell phones, particularly the Jitterbug.  The segment was filled with jokes and insults exchanged between the hosts and Leary.

A subsequent segment focused on listener-submitted jokes and nicknames for cell phones marketed to the elderly, resulting in numerous crude and offensive names like "Panasonic Palsy," "Samsung Broken Hip," and "LG Depends."  The conversation shifted to a high-pitched tone used to deter teenagers and phones with disguised caller ID.  The latter half centered on the 30th anniversary of the Jonestown massacre, including the playing of audio recordings from the eventâ€”Jim Jones's speeches and the cries of children. Callers reacted with varying degrees of outrage and fascination, with some criticizing the hosts for playing the audio. The hosts defended their decision, framing it as historically significant footage, while engaging in dark humor and offensive remarks about the victims.

The final segment continued the discussion of the Jonestown massacre, spurred by a caller's mention of a woman speaking out against Jim Jones.  The hosts and callers discussed Jones's personality, recruitment methods, the details of the deaths, and the aftermath, alongside other cults and mass violence.  Callers shared personal connections to Jonestown or other cults, including one whose family was involved in the Freeman standoff.  Chris the Trucker emphasized the importance of raising awareness through such discussions. Another caller shared information about Jim Jones's alleged sexual acts.  The segment was punctuated by crude jokes and inappropriate comments.  A caller claimed to have been in the same second-grade class as one of the hosts, leading to off-topic conversation.  The show ended with a discussion about listener merchandise and a final call from a woman in Nebraska discussing her lack of internet access and employment.  The segment included numerous off-color remarks, sexual references, and darkly humorous commentary.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Brrrr!  Oh my god, I'm trying to wake up.  Ah! Good morning.  Hi.  My mic, uh, yeah, there it is.  Your mic is working, Anthony. Welcome back to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Oh, was I away?  A little respite. A one-day respite for Anthony.  Yes!  Yes!  How is everybody? 
[00:00:30]  I'm tired today. Real tired.  A little snoozy.  I had to go down to Philly and back in one day. That's always fun after doing the radio show.  I feel like a drug mule these days.  Just back and forth.  Yeah.  That's what you do when you marry an out-stater.  Oh yeah?  Yeah.  Got stuff to do in the city you're going to be married in.  Yikes.  We should pick a girl from Pennsylvania, which is smart. You didn't go with, like, Oregon or... 
[00:01:00]  Imagine that.  South Dakota can imagine that.  On these five-hour flights each way.  Yeah.  The last thing you want to do after doing a radio show is get on a train and go somewhere.  Yeah.  All you want is your bed.  From anywhere from a half hour to two hours.  Just a little nap.  Six hours.  Six hours.  Whatever.  Sure.  Whatever you need at the moment.  Instead, you're on a choo-choo train.  Choo-choo.  They don't choo-choo anymore, though. 
[00:01:30]  No, they make very loud noises.  Were we alive for the choo-choo?  Yeah.  Choo-choo.  I remember choo-choo when I lived near the train station.  Yeah?  Yeah, lots of choo-choo.  When did choo-choo go away?  I don't know.  Then it just turned into...  Yeah.  The good old days, it was choo-choo.  Yeah.  You can hear that as you fall asleep at night.  Yeah, yeah.  Way far away.  Ah, choo-choo. 
[00:02:00]  It's always weird.  It's like, I don't even live near the train.  Right.  How am I hearing this?  Yeah, you're right.  I didn't live close to the Greenlawn station, but man, I heard that choo-choo.  Choo-choo.  Now, like you said.  That's because idiots decided they wanted to drive around the little gates.  Oh, right.  So, yeah.  So, we got to make sure we save the idiots.  Yeah.  Save the idiots.  We are so dumb as humans.  Stop saving the idiots.  That's why we end up having a dumb country, because we save the idiots, and they seem to 
[00:02:30]  keep reproducing.  There was a guy, speaking of save the idiots, there's two things.  I got two quick train stories.  When I was leaving Penn Station around 8.30 last night, it was an all-day thing, but  I'm hence very tired today.  I'm getting ready to go up the escalator.  There's a homeless guy.  Of course.  No shoes.  And it's getting kind of cold here in New York.  I know it's colder in other places.  No shoes.  No pants. 
[00:03:00]  Boxer shorts on.  Completely out of his mind.  Hair askew.  His hands looked like they didn't really work.  So he had a bagel on the handrail, or just off the handrail of the escalator, and he  was staring at it, and then every once in a while he would peck at it.  Like a bird?  Yeah.  And he was eating like that as people were trying to use the escalator.  Just hit him over the head with a shovel.  Yeah.  You know.  And his misery. 
[00:03:30]  But someone would try to make his life better.  I say stop saving the idiots.  Yeah.  Please.  And then.  You better get them cream cheese.  Right.  And then it's a bagel, right?  Huh?  You did say bagel.  Yeah, yeah.  It was a bagel.  And it was just like sloppy wet, and there was just pieces, and he was just pecking away.  Every once in a while he would just kind of, he would stare at it.  I guess he was deciding where he was going to bite it next.  Was he a bird?  I don't know.  Did he give it that weird sideways look that birds do?  Yes.  Yes. 
[00:04:00]  He had that weird look like he was staring at it.  And it must be nice.  That's your, the only thing you have to worry about is where to bite the bagel.  I don't think that's probably nice.  Where you have no pants on, no socks, no shoes.  No dice.  Your only worry is to just nip away at a bagel as people are trying to use the escalator.  Sounds like he's living the life of Riley.  Yeah.  And then in Philly, you think this was a scam?  Some young.  Yes.  Young drug addict comes up to me, and I go, ah, I don't have any money. 
[00:04:30]  Right?  Yeah.  That's what you do, because you don't want to deal with it.  You don't want to get in a conversation.  Ah, I don't have any money.  Yell, grunt, groan, whatever it takes.  And he goes, oh, actually, I'm not looking for money.  I need to use your cell phone to make a phone call.  Get out of here, you.  Now, what do you think would have happened if I handed him the cell phone?  A couple of things.  He takes off running.  Oh, I would have killed him.  He takes off running.  Well, let me ask you a little question.  Yeah.  Did he look like the kind of guy that could probably out-sprint you? 
[00:05:00]  Hell no.  No?  Hell no.  Why?  Division III cross-country runner.  Cheers.  Look, look, look.  No, no, no, no, no.  I don't think you're understanding my question.  Cheers.  Did he look like the type of guy that could probably out-run you?  He wasn't black.  Oh.  I didn't get to that.  He wasn't black.  Did he have lean, muscular legs?  He wasn't black.  He was a young white kid that, I don't know, mommy and daddy didn't pay attention to him  or something.  Oh, right?  What was his thing that he said he had to use your cell phone for?  He's like stuck at the train station and needs to make a phone call. 
[00:05:30]  I'm like, no.  You're not taking my phone and running off with it.  Yeah.  How much could he get for a BlackBerry that's about six to eight months old?  I don't know.  A few bucks on the black market?  He wasn't going to give it back?  I'm not stupid.  Maybe he'd dial a friend's number and then your number would show up and somehow he'd  figure out some way to screw you over.  Oh, that's what I was figuring. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  And then he decides he's all dejected.  He sits sort of next to me and I'm waiting for a train for 15 minutes and then I get up.  I'm like, I guess that phone call wasn't too important.  You didn't ask anyone else, did you now?  Have a nice day.  Yeah.  This cops, everything, you know?  It's like, all right.  Why don't you ask a cop if you, quote, need to make a phone call?  I'm sure he'll lend you his.  A lot of assistance there.  Right.  Made a phone.  Oh, God, people. 
[00:06:30]  He probably did just need to make a phone call, but it's like, in this world, it's like,  too bad.  You know what?  No one trusts anyone.  No.  There was a scam going on.  He wasn't right.  It wasn't like it was a young, clean-cut college kid.  Yeah.  With a nice little, like, university sweatshirt on.  This guy was a mess.  Actually, my girl felt sorry for him.  Like, don't feel sorry for him.  We can't save the idiots anymore.  Real good people are out of work, so let's stop saving the idiots.  Everyone's losing their jobs out there. 
[00:07:00]  So guess what?  The idiots have to take a back seat.  It's our fault, too, I guess.  Huh?  I don't know.  I just heard it's our fault that people are losing their jobs.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  If you want to get into it.  Dude, I want to hear what it was said.  If you want to get into it, no problem.  I'd love to get into it.  Because I want to hear what was said.  And I want to hear from somebody else that maybe we should shut up, and then I could tell  that piece of crap, lying sack of crap, to shut up also. 
[00:07:30]  I want to make it perfectly clear I'm following your lead.  Because I guess I'm the loose cannon around here.  So we're following Anthony's lead on this.  I just want to know.  Anthony's lead.  Just want to know what the story was.  Well, Steve Freed was let go from this fine radio station, this fine company.  What?  Friday was his last day.  Friday was his last little day.  I don't know all the details, but it didn't sound good.  I'll tell you that much.  41 years of service, a couple years away from retirement.  He was an engineer that was here for 41 years. 
[00:08:00]  And the company let him go.  Whatever.  The company has to do what they have to do.  I don't even question that.  Because I know how crappy this business has become.  Yep.  I've heard that they took away his seven months of sick pay that he was building up.  So he could get to that retirement age a little earlier.  You know what I mean?  So now you retire at what?  64 in five months.  You've got the seven months.  You hit 65.  Pension.  Set.  You pay for medical insurance. 
[00:08:30]  Because that's all he cares about.  But I'm hearing that they took that away from him.  And I'm hearing that they took, you know, they basically screwed him by not letting him retire.  I don't know.  That's what I've heard.  Heard one side?  Who knows?  Sure.  Whatever.  So we did the right thing.  And we figured, wow, someone has to at least acknowledge this guy's leaving after 41 years.  So we invited our breakfast people in to make an omelet.  Yeah.  You know, last minute we're like, we've got to acknowledge this guy.  And most of the people heard the show.  It was black comedy at best on Friday. 
[00:09:00]  And we sent Steve Freed off, you know?  Yeah.  The best we could do in a last minute's, you know, situation.  Bon voyage.  So I guess Howard, you know, he only does four days of radio a week.  And he gets, what, 20 weeks of vacation?  Something crazy like that.  Yeah.  He finally gets on the radio yesterday.  And he acknowledges Steve Freed leaving the company because, you know, Steve used to do the would ye voice for Howard. 
[00:09:30]  Sure.  And instead of, like, doing, you know, the right thing and just talking about it and stuff, he has to, like, he has to blame us for Steve Freed's firing.  Try to place blame and it's on us.  That's what I'm hearing.  I haven't heard one iota of this.  Well, I came in this morning and, I don't know, five minutes before we're going on the air, Iraq comes in with a disc and says, oh, Howard said this.  Right.  And I've heard stuff like this before and it's turned out to be nothing or whatever.  But now I want to hear it along with the listeners, along with everybody else for the first time. 
[00:10:00]  I want to hear what he says.  And if he does blame us in any way, shape or form, I have a rebuttal comment I would like.  Nice.  I like that.  A bit of an obsession about us.  I got to be honest with you.  You know, we haven't talked or we haven't mentioned word one about that.  Let me tell you something.  We've been good little soldiers.  We've been good little soldiers for the company.  And I'm talking about the satellite company.  Done everything they've asked of us.  We've been bent over and reamed and still come on and smiled and done our goddamn show like real troopers. 
[00:10:30]  Right.  We do our job without letting any of that inter-office crap get in the way of what we do.  All right.  So now, if he has something to say, I'd like to hear it.  Here it is.  And then comment.  Steve was there like 42 years.  Steve worked there when my dad worked there.  I know.  Uh, yeah.  Well, you know, what happens is, let me see if I can put this into perspective for you. 
[00:11:00]  What's happened since we left CBS Viacom Radio is nothing short of a nuclear bomb.  I suppose you could blame Steve's firing and Nancy the receptionist and just about every horrible thing that's going on there on the fact that they can't find anyone to replace us.  The things are so bad.  Oh, my God.  I can't find anyone to replace us.  You are such a loser.  You can't find anyone to replace us.  You're a loser.  They found people to replace you. 
[00:11:30]  You've been gone for a while.  People have replaced you.  The business itself.  Look at the economy, you out-of-touch, dumb son of a bitch.  Look at the economy.  It sucks.  They weren't laying off people and firing people the day you left.  Everything was hunky-dory.  Place us.  The things are so bad there.  The morale is so low.  In radio.  In the whole business. 
[00:12:00]  The whole friggin' business of radio.  Places you never worked.  Those companies are suffering too.  There's not one radio company that is doing well.  And that has nothing to do with the fact that Howard left regular radio.  The entire business is changing.  Were you working at Fannie Mae?  Was that it?  Were you at Lehman Brothers also?  Did you leave there and it went to hell?  And they had to fire a bunch of people?  How about the automakers?  Was Howard Stern the CEO of General Motors or Ford? 
[00:12:30]  Ford when, now that they're having to fire thousands of people?  Was that because of, they couldn't find anyone to replace you as CEO of Ford?  The economy sucks, you dummy!  We don't all make a half a billion dollars a year.  Or five years.  And have mansions out in the Hamptons.  Get in touch!  He'll take credit with the fact that the economy collapsed too.  You know.  Get in touch! 
[00:13:00]  The fact is, and it's pretty sad that Howard has children.  Hard to see the common man at a polo match.  Faggot!  The guy just continues to lie.  He can't be honest about anything.  I don't want to hear it from Greenstein either.  I don't want to hear it from friggin' what's his name from Philly.  Who?  Ah!  Oh, Sabian?  Sabian either.  I don't want to hear it from him.  I don't want to hear it from the new guy that we talked to. 
[00:13:30]  What?  You know, you can't say anything about Howard.  Then tell him to shut up about us ruining the economy.  Or at least tell the goddamn truth.  And the truth is that the whole business is collapsing.  There's not a radio company out there doing well.  There are radio companies that Howard had nothing to do with that are collapsing.  The economy stinks.  There's a whole change going on in the way people get their music and get their information and everything else.  And that has to be adapted to this medium. 
[00:14:00]  The days of anyone getting Howard Stern-type ratings in regular radio are so long gone.  Even if Howard himself came back to regular radio, he wouldn't come close to what he was doing when he left.  Because this entire business is changing in front of our eyes.  Jesus Christ.  Can someone just put a reality hat on him?  Well, listen a little further here.  The things are so bad there. 
[00:14:30]  The morale is so low.  The economic times are so bad that you could blame David Lee Roth.  Who else?  Who else is there?  Just the opian, Anthony, David Lee Roth.  And there was somebody else who did mornings there, didn't they?  Maybe I'm wrong.  Or blame us.  Blame us because...  It's wonderful.  I know what he's doing there.  The pause because he's not really sure.  I don't know.  What?  Oh, yeah.  No, you know exactly who we are.  Because you'll be making your stupid phone call later today because we were talking about you. 
[00:15:00]  But Stunt Brain, how well do we do over here?  Are we not number one in the mail demos?  It's not our fault that they can't sell it right now in these economic times.  We're holding up our end.  We're bringing in the big numbers in our demos and regularly one and two, back and forth, all the books.  There you go.  We're doing our job.  So to lump us in with that horse crap, David Lee Roth, that was a disaster.  A guy that did radio for two, three months.  We've been at this and I together over 14 effing years. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  And Howard knows the truth.  So why don't you tell your audience the truth?  And if you want to talk about working for a company that's not doing well, do you really want to get into this?  Yeah.  Do you understand that there had to be a merger to save satellite radio?  And how about...  You're not holding up your end of the bargain, pal.  How about he's the savior?  Look at the stock price, pal.  Yeah, what's the stock at?  23 cents.  23 cents.  What was the stock when you went to satellite radio, pal? 
[00:16:00]  I don't see morale too well over there either.  Jackass.  It's just crappy times we're in right now.  Don't be blaming us.  And if I hear one word from one of those suits that, oh, you should shut up about that.  Don't talk about that.  Well, then tell him to shut up.  Tell him to shut his trap.  About us.  Don't be blaming us for the hard times that radio is having.  There was somebody else who did mornings there, didn't they? 
[00:16:30]  No.  Maybe I'm wrong.  No.  Or blame us.  Blame us because we left, and they can't apparently make a dime since we left.  Just the entire...  It's imploded.  That's what it is.  It was like when in Vegas they take down one of those hotels.  Yeah.  That's what happened.  As opposed to the money that's rolling in.  The money that's rolling in right now for your employers now?  Is that what you're talking about?  They couldn't make a dime?  Is that it?  What are you talking about?  Is there money rolling in because you're on satellite radio, Howard? 
[00:17:00]  Really?  Do you want to get into this?  See?  We deal with reality, and we deal with honesty on this show.  You really want to deal with this?  So if you were so great, you leave regular radio, and then what happened?  What happened?  Wherever you go, should have been a gold mine.  What happened?  It was for you.  What happened?  Why is the stock price at 23 cents?  Why?  Why don't you explain that to your listeners?  I had to bend over.  I had to bend over while the suits gave us the big high hard one when we negotiated. 
[00:17:30]  Please.  Then there was an apology.  Sorry, guys.  Please, just shut up.  I don't want to hear from anybody over there.  Let me do my show and leave me alone.  Hotels?  Yeah.  That's what happened.  And I'm sad about that because, you know, there were a lot of good folks working with  us over at that radio.  Well, then you should have stayed.  Well, then you should have stayed.  You should have thought, ah, should I take 100 million a year? 
[00:18:00]  Or should I stay here and protect everybody's job by being the Jesus Christ of radio?  Yeah, this guy is the biggest phony.  Yeah.  We haven't talked about you in months, probably in close to a year.  And you know what?  Why don't you talk about all the firings that just went down yesterday at Sirius, you ass?  Yeah.  You couldn't save the jobs of the people around you at your new job.  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  And how about the reason you left radio?  Oh, restrictions were pouring on left and right.  The FCC, politically correct groups were taunting you. 
[00:18:30]  That's what happens.  That's what happens.  And that's one of the reasons, that's one of the reasons that the industry went to crap.  And Howard, you want to talk about good people.  Did you try to save Mike Peters' job or Shirley Maldonado, however the hell you say it,  Tanya Bird, Howard Marcus, Brian Atwood, Wayne Mayo, Matt Abramowitz, something like that. 
[00:19:00]  And someone we know from our NAW days, Andrea Carr, who we just met in the hallways when we were  over there last, a week or two ago.  Yeah.  What about those nice people?  What about those nice people?  Are we to blame for that?  That just went down two days ago, Howard.  Is that our fault?  Is that David Lee Roth's fault?  Don't lump us in with that David Lee Roth crap.  You know that's not anywhere as close to real.  Or is it the newlywed goose that all of a sudden ain't laying golden eggs? 
[00:19:30]  Give me a break.  Wonderful people that we were with for 20 years.  Yeah, I mean, Tom Chiasano's job went out the window, Steve's job went out the window,  Nancy's job went out the window.  Quite frankly, I hardly know anybody who's there anymore.  Yeah, there's no one here.  But guess what?  It's across the board.  Every radio company's doing this.  Every radio company.  And this crap would have went on if you stayed here.  The whole business is changing in front of our eyes. 
[00:20:00]  It's going to become something else.  It will survive, but right now the whole damn thing's at a crossroads.  The whole damn thing.  I'm not going to just sit here, though, and have him blame us for all the firings going on at CBS.  That's the bottom line here.  That's the bottom line of what I'm pissed about with him spouting off like that.  Don't try to blame me for people getting fired over here or at any other radio place. 
[00:20:30]  So who's to blame over there?  Who's to blame?  There was a lot of layoffs, man.  A lot of layoffs.  Stop it, you pompous douche.  Just please stop already.  No one wants to hear.  It's been too many years of the same frigging babble coming out of your mouth.  Just shut it.  Just do your stupid show.  We'll do our stupid show, and that's it.  We'll coexist. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  We haven't talked about you.  I haven't said word one except nice things.  Why don't you tell your people that the company had nothing planned for Steve Fried, and we actually, you know, it's scary to tell anybody, but Opie and Anthony are actually good guys when it comes down to it.  Why don't you tell your stupid listeners that we did what we could for the guy as he's being shown the door on his last day.  I don't understand you guys.  Oh, go after yourself.  What good does it do to have you talking ill of Howard? 
[00:21:30]  I just want to know what that is.  Don't tell that out of touch ass.  Can I choke you with your tie?  Can I choke you with your tie?  Well, and there was, you know exactly who we are, ass.  Remember, I'm not ready for Opie yet.  Remember that little phone call you had recently?  Remember, Howard?  Jackass. 
[00:22:00]  That's enough.  Enough.  That's the bottom line.  I'm not going to be blamed for the people losing their jobs here at CBS.  Just stop it.  Oh, it sucks.  I mean.  Stop it already.  We're doing this in broad strokes.  You could go radio company by radio company, see what they were doing a mere year to two years ago, and see where they're at now.  It's unbelievable.  Most of these radio company stocks are under a dollar.  It's really bad across the board.  Have you seen the market lately?  Have you seen the market lately? 
[00:22:30]  But not even though.  It really sucks.  Have you seen the housing market and finance stocks and the big three automakers?  Is that all?  Who's to blame for that?  With all of your wisdom, could you please tell me who's to blame there?  David Lee Roth?  Right.  Was David Lee Roth running a boozy, boozy, bat, diddy, bat?  Hey, let me put out an Escalade.  Hey, let me.  Yeah.  Is he to blame?  Well, one of the points that needs to be made, the radio company stocks were already, you know, crapping the bed before the whole collapse of the economy. 
[00:23:00]  So you can't even, like, go, well, it's the economy bringing everything down.  The radio business was already suffering before that.  Yeah.  And they're doing what they can behind the scenes to try to figure it out, you know?  But don't sit there, like Ant said, and blame us.  Blame us.  You know damn well what the real story is, ass.  Wrapping your hat. 
[00:23:30]  Stupid dreck.  O.P. and Anthony, good morning to everybody.  Such a Yiddish word.  What?  Dreck is such a Yiddish.  I know it is.  Jewish word.  And we've moved on, so don't even try to figure out why.  Just the dreck.  877-212-ON-A.  What's up, Ant?  Let's see.  Yesterday I had a little, I was recuperating from a party from Sunday. 
[00:24:00]  Was it a good party?  Yeah.  Mom and Sal, 25 wedded years of bliss.  Nice.  So, of course, I got party detail now.  Now that my house is kind of almost done, I wind up getting party detail.  Well, it's hard to go anywhere else when you have a house like that.  So they all came over, relatives and friends and whatnot.  Yeah.  There was a lot of wine.  So I kind of knew at 7.30 when no one had left yet that I wasn't getting to bed anytime soon. 
[00:24:30]  And I kind of knew I was going to have a hard time getting up, so why even push it?  Yeah.  It was a good time, though.  Everyone had fun.  Very good.  One of those things.  I think Sal tried to stab Mom when they were cutting the cake.  Why?  I don't know.  It was just like 25 years, and then he made like he was going to stab her.  And then no one even stopped him.  And then slipped and went, oh, my God.  Oops.  I actually almost stabbed you.  I stabbed Ray. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, no.  Yeah.  So that was that.  And yesterday was just, you know, nothing.  It's weird when you have these hours, because if you don't come in, you sleep until you would  have been done with work anyway.  Oh, sure.  So I wake up and go, oh, I guess I should have went in.  Not knowing that at, you know, five o'clock, I would, oh, I felt like crap.  Right.  But I slept right through it.  You, uh, that's good. 
[00:25:30]  I turned a Monday into a Sunday, is what I did.  But I'm a chipper.  I'm all ready to go now.  Well, sorry.  We started like we did, but what are you going to do?  Ah, that's what it is.  What are you going to do?  Whatever it is it is.  You know?  That's it.  And that's always.  Give it a vent.  I'll tell you this much, because it's been misconstrued over the years.  We always just react.  We don't start that crap with that guy.  It's always a reaction.  And then we, and then, you know, we, uh, we get scolded for reacting. 
[00:26:00]  Of course we're going to react.  No, we're not going to allow anyone to just casually, you know, beat us down like that.  Especially, especially when it's, it's, it's not, uh, based on reality and honesty.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, uh, Proposition 8.  Ooh.  Sexy.  Now we're back to sexy.  Well, to the, to the gay people out there, you know,  some of the, these people are, you know, coming out of the closet and stuff.  We need a good one. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  We need a good one to come out of the closet.  Like, what do you mean?  Like the American Idol dude that had a.  Clay Aiken?  Clay Aiken finally comes out of the closet, right?  Could you believe it?  Yeah.  Ooh.  It was shocking.  And he was debating if he should do this or not for years.  And then it comes.  Everyone knew.  And then he comes out of the closet and it's like.  Yeah.  Well, tell us something else we don't know.  And we just have another one of those that just happened a couple days ago.  Maybe yesterday or two days ago. 
[00:27:00]  And it's like, all right.  All right.  Well, why were you debating this for years?  We all know.  Jimmy Norton?  Or we had an idea.  No.  Wait, that's not true.  No.  Can't judge someone a few hundred inches.  I think these guys are like, all right, today's the day.  I'm going to do this.  And they expect to open their front door and just have just, just craziness.  Yeah.  Just craziness.  I need to do a press conference.  And who came out? 
[00:27:30]  It's going to be another one with crickets.  Like, all right.  Here it is.  I got married October 25th.  No life is here.  And, you know, I don't really talk about my sexual orientation.  I feel like I had to.  You know, I was just living my life.  And everybody that knows me personally, they know I'm gay.  They know, you know. 
[00:28:00]  I am.  And that's the way people should be able to live their lives, really.  If we had equal rights, we shouldn't have to be standing out there demanding something  that we automatically should have as citizens of this country.  There you go.  Wow.  Wanda Sykes officially comes out of the closet because of this whole Prop 8 thing that's  happened out there in California.  Damn.  She's not going to take it anymore.  So she's like, look, there you go.  That was more surprising than Clay Aiken, that's for sure. 
[00:28:30]  Wanda Sykes.  I just never thought about it.  What are you kidding?  Because I never thought about it.  She would come to the cellar with her girl.  You know, it was never just like, it was never said.  Well, you're on the inside.  But no, I mean, you know, it was never said, but you just, it's like when your uncle comes  like, oh, Uncle George is coming with his roommate.  Right.  You just know.  His roommate of 25 years.  Yeah.  Like, wow, they must really have a good rent deal.  We've all had to deal with that one, right?  Okay.  Well, make believe your roommate's from college. 
[00:29:00]  Trying to save on the utilities, are you?  You're 50 now.  We were not stupid.  Maybe when I was eight, I couldn't figure it out.  But now that I'm 20 something, will you just shut up?  I had no idea.  Huh?  I have an aunt who's gay and I had no idea when I was young.  Really?  No.  She was very athletic, but I was young.  And she would always have these friends come over.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She had some cool friends.  They're all girls.  So.  I like a gay cousin that was, I don't know, he was probably in his early, I don't even 
[00:29:30]  know, mid-teens, who knows?  But I knew because all I heard was everybody else talking about him in the effing F, you  know, the way they would talk about him.  Your family would?  Well, not to his face.  But, you know, so I would know, of course.  Come on.  What are you kidding?  Your family doesn't support that crap?  No.  At that time, you know, now they've become much more liberal.  Gotta support that crap.  Or dead. 
[00:30:00]  But, you know, for the most part, now everybody's pretty cool with things.  Yeah.  All right.  But one of Sykes chose probably.  He won Miss Fire Island once.  Huh?  He won Miss Fire Island once back in the 80s.  Miss?  Yes.  He won Miss Fire Island.  Miss?  Yeah.  Your cousin?  They all guss you up into female clothing and stuff and look all hot and walk around.  And he won Miss Fire Island.  What's his girl name?  I had no idea. 
[00:30:30]  I'm sure I don't know.  Jimmy just wants to cross-reference.  All right.  I don't even think.  We're elated.  I bumped into him one time on Eros.  Oops.  That would be wonderful if you guys have shared it.  That would be hilarious.  Oh, Joe.  Hysterical.  Well, we'd laugh about it for hours just to avoid eye contact.  So, Wanda Sykes comes out because of the Proposition 8.  She should have came out because it was a Monday. 
[00:31:00]  Like, everyone knew.  That was...  Yeah.  She was married at one point.  I mean, when I first met Wanda, she was married.  To a guy?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She was married.  I'll see.  Okay.  That's tricky.  But now she's married to a woman.  She said she got married in October.  So, yeah.  I guess they split.  So, you don't know.  All of a sudden, you see somebody, and we would see her, and then she would be with  somebody else, but it was like an assistant.  So, at first, you didn't think, but then it was the same person for a while.  You're like, oh, okay.  Yeah.  So, what does the wife look like?  She's very sexy.  She's the same person I'm thinking of.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Lipstick or butch? 
[00:31:30]  Any pictures?  No, she's very feminine.  Very pretty.  Lipstick?  Nice.  Yeah.  I was like, oof.  Lipstick lesbian.  Lovely.  Is there anything better than that?  Lipstick bisexuals.  Because they have a better shot at anyone else.  Yeah, good point.  Lipstick a point.  That's not with Wanda Sykes.  Yeah, single lipstick lesbian.  Here's the second part of the story.  How can you get upset about love?  And I'm sick of this stuff about, oh, well, you made that choice.  That's your choice.  Gay is not a choice.  Being gay is not.  That's like telling me I chose to be a woman. 
[00:32:00]  I chose to be black.  So, are we saying that if being gay is a choice, that people are straight because they chose not  to be gay?  Yeah.  Well, I am very proud.  I am proud to be a woman.  I'm proud to be a black woman.  I'm proud to be gay.  Comes in third.  Comes in third behind woman and black.  Gay.  But she'll bring some comedy into the whole thing, which is good.  Yeah.  The damn issue needs some laughs, some comedy. 
[00:32:30]  A few laughs.  Oh, my God.  I think it's both.  I think people are born gay.  You can tell those people.  I think most people.  You can see.  Most people.  Most people.  I don't know.  Percentage.  Well, what would you say percentage, though?  I'd say...  You kind of think the percentage is way up there.  65 and 70 between there.  I can remember.  Plus or minus three points.  Okay.  And then you're saying like 25 to 30% of people choose it?  The rest choose to be gay for various reasons. 
[00:33:00]  Some just strictly for attention.  Some because they like the lifestyle better, perhaps.  Some because they're just sexually, I don't know, like they're into a little bit of everything.  I don't know.  You know, you could tell somebody that is born gay when they're like frigging six years old  and they're, you know, with mommy's clothes and playing with dolls and stuff.  It's just over Johnny.  You know damn well that kid's going to be gay. 
[00:33:30]  It's over Johnny.  And then there's the guys that are married, you know, holding down a job.  He's a football player.  Is this not the other thing?  And then all of a sudden, ah, I just decided I'm gay.  You know, to me, that's more like you've chosen a lifestyle  because maybe you're not happy with your life  and you think that that might, you know, perk things up.  Or some of those guys were probably fighting it and got married incorrectly.  Yeah, yeah, I'm sure some of them, right.  And not choosing to be gay, but they had for a long time been just going the other way 
[00:34:00]  and been miserable.  I think people, though, some of them, a lot more than people think,  choose just because, boy, it looks like a fun lifestyle  if, you know, you could take that in your face.  That's a big if, Hans.  Yeah, it is a big if.  That's not just a change of apartments.  You throw that around like it's like, hey, look,  if you can handle that and picking things out of your beard the next morning,  it's a perfectly logical choice.  Jimmy makes a good point.  That is a huge if.  Yeah.  You can wash your face 20 times and still smell it. 
[00:34:30]  If you don't mind bleaching the mustache, you know, it's no worries.  This Proposition 8 isn't going to go away, though.  No.  This thing is going to turn into a biggie.  And she's a biggie.  She's funny and she's aggressive, which I like.  Like, she's not going to sit there and just try to be passive about it.  She'll be very outspoken about it and funny.  It's the only way to deal with people.  You know, it's odd, though.  It's brutality.  It was the vote of the people, you know. 
[00:35:00]  This was the vote of the people of California.  Whether it should even be put to a vote is an odd thing.  You know, I think it should just be whatever you want to do.  Screw it.  But it was voted on.  To reverse that, eh, I don't know.  That's kind of a little.  That's a tough one, right?  The old slippery slope.  Yeah, but you've got to protect the rights.  It's like the weird thing about majority rules,  but also one of the things about the country is that the minority interests are protected.  It's like just because you're not in the majority, you're not going to be trampled on. 
[00:35:30]  And it's like, to me, they're not asking for anything that they shouldn't have.  We talked about this yesterday, too.  It's not like they want privileges or things that straight people don't have.  It's like, leave them alone.  Take your religious agenda and choke on it.  A little Puritan nation you live in.  That's what drives me nuts.  It really is just crazy.  Based on this false ethics that we have that is all crap anyway.  And the biggest people that were pushing this, look who they've been housing for all these years.  Look who they've been covering up for and shipping from Paris to Paris. 
[00:36:00]  Yes.  Young boy, it's so dear.  Wow, I'm a priest.  Yeah, it's true.  Yeah, so how can you listen to them?  Is it snowing?  No.  The news just showed some snowflakes as they did their forecast.  They say that.  It's like, snow for our area?  We'll tell you later.  And then they go, yes, north and west of the area, and they mean like Chicago.  They just showed a shot with some flakes coming down.  I mean, I don't think it's going to be anything, but maybe Kenny scratched his head. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, you're right.  You figured out we don't do weather here.  Yeah.  Go on your computer or your phone.  Press your app.  Your weather app.  That's what's wrong with this business.  They've got to update everything.  You don't need a radio station to give you the weather.  When's your big phone coming out?  The 21st?  I think it's Friday.  21st?  But I don't know about it.  Your big phone comes out?  Hey, look.  Which one?  This new...  The Storm.  The new BlackBerry, the Touch, Verizon. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, that's...  Yeah.  But I don't know.  Hey, look.  It might suck.  I mean, I have no commitment to it.  I want to say it.  Yeah.  Why did I just say it with that little high-pitched annoying voice?  Who could listen to this?  Hey, I just want to say it, guys.  I will.  I want to drive a ball.  Non-committal.  Are we giving away $1,000 today?  No, apparently we don't have $1,000.  We don't have two pennies to rub together to put on an event that has been proven successful  year after year.  But for some reason, CBS FM, the oldie station or whatever the hell they are now, they can 
[00:37:30]  give away $1,000 a day.  They're basically giving away Steve Freed's retirement money.  The giving away is $4,01.  They, yeah.  They actually went to corporate.  Somebody actually went there and said, we need $1,000 every day for the Santa song of  the day.  Oh, wow.  And someone in corporate went, okay.  Yeah.  It was, I think, who's the guy that works over there? 
[00:38:00]  Obi-Wan Kenobi.  That's who it was.  He went up and said, we need $1,000 a day.  You need $1,000 a day.  And it was given to them.  You know, if you don't do that contest for maybe two weeks, we can still have a receptionist  around here.  Yeah.  I'm not even, you know.  Yeah.  We lost our receptionist.  When someone's knocking at the door.  Oh, it astounds me.  It's so stupid. 
[00:38:30]  We all got the press because Steve Freed left.  And then fast forward a mere two days, we find out they're giving away $1,000 a day.  $5,000 a week.  Just like it's nothing.  I just, I.  For that crappy music station.  I find out because on my little circular piece of crap desk in our office, it's just  full of garbage that I guess, I guess they use my desk when I'm not there or whatever  after we leave.  I don't know what happens.  But there's paper on there and it was about this contest and I'm reading it going, $1,000 
[00:39:00]  a day.  $1,000 a day?  And we asked for like $500 for something and they, $500, what are you trying time?  Oh, that's been preposterous.  But, wow.  Yeah.  This is a great article in the Daily News, maybe after the break.  The Today Show decided to go all over the planet. 
[00:39:30]  You got big fat Al Roker in Iceland.  Really?  Yeah.  Showing what a real glacier looks like, I guess.  It'd be funny if a glacier just knocked him over.  Yeah.  That would be great.  And then you got Matt Lauer.  He should be beaten with a club when they think he just sealed.  You got Matt Lauer in Belize.  You got Ann Curry, like, I guess, mountain climbing, Mount Kilimanjaro or whatever.  She's in Tanzania.  And then where's the other dummy?  Oh, in Sydney, right?  In Australia, yeah.  Why?  And we should get Richard Huff. 
[00:40:00]  We love Richard Huff from the Daily News.  He's got a great article today.  He goes, here's the problem.  They're doing a whole green thing, showing what is happening to our planet because of what  we're doing, allegedly, right?  Right.  And Richard Huff makes the great point today in the paper that it's tough to buy into what  they're telling us because they're telling this stuff from beautiful places.  Yeah.  Where it's hard to actually show the destruction.  Because this world is full of beautiful places.  Yeah, we've trashed some joints, but... 
[00:40:30]  So what's...  I mean, what was the headline?  Hold on.  And I don't think they walked and swam there.  I think they were put on jet planes.  Of course they were.  They burn a lot of fuel.  Of course.  You want to get picky.  With crews of people, and they rented giant trucks that have to shoot signals up to satellites.  So if you're talking about green, they're not doing it with solar-powered vehicles.  Yeah, we don't work for NBC, right?  I think we have stock.  No, it's GE.  This is our GE.  We can finally trash someone where we don't get in trouble for trashing them. 
[00:41:00]  That's good.  I think they could pull up some stock footage of these places and just, you know, play it.  Hey, look how nice is it.  But Richard Huff writes, eco-threats look low today.  The threat looks low because the scenery is so beautiful.  So you, the viewer, it's like, you're trying to tell me what?  Because, wow, that looks like really, really nice.  Really perfect.  NBC's top-rated Today show yesterday produced a lush look at spots around the world suffering from the impact of man.  And while Al Roker in Iceland and Matt Lauer in Belize brought stunning visuals for addressing world environmental issues, 
[00:41:30]  their striking backdrops may have diluted the message.  Yeah, exactly.  Very, very good.  So it's a good read in the Daily News today if you're picking up that paper here in New York.  Maybe we'll get Richard Huff on for a quick one.  Didn't we want to ask him something else recently?  There was something else that came up that we wanted to...  I don't remember.  Probably some lousy TV show or one of those things.  Oh, you had something else?  Sorry.  Yeah, I was just speaking to TV shows. 
[00:42:00]  I watched something last night on JFK, The Assassination and What Not.  PBS has been playing some cool stuff.  And they had the news and how the news, kind of television news, impacted that story and how it was really the first story, Kennedy assassination,  that really families were just sitting there pinned to their televisions where beforehand they got most of their news from print media.  A lot of people just bought the newspaper.  They trusted the newspaper more than they trusted television media. 
[00:42:30]  A lot of times print media got the scoop off of television because it was just too inconvenient to have these cameras out getting this footage,  bringing it back to a studio, developing all this, and then waiting for the actual news to come on unless it was an important story with the breaking bulletin like the Kennedy assassination was.  And that whole thing that followed with Oswald being shot and everything.  It was a whole just 72 hours, I think, of people sitting in front of their television. 
[00:43:00]  And the most interesting part of it was watching television news kind of start and see where it is now.  And there was a guy holding this little microphone, and there's this TV show.  It looked like almost an early 60s version of the Today Show or one of those.  And this woman's talking about a bracelet.  And you can slip this on.  And then it just, the camera shakes violently. 
[00:43:30]  It goes to a corner of a room, and this guy's standing there with a microphone shaking with a copy in his hand going,  I have something very important to you.  Oh, really?  It's just in.  Like, they didn't know how to go to a bulletin.  They didn't know how it was done.  It was just panic everywhere.  It was just somebody going here.  And the woman's looking around like, what are you doing?  You don't move the camera.  And they moved it to him, and he gave this bulletin.  He's sweating.  He's shaking.  He's smoking a butt.  Like, just smoking cigarettes and stuff. 
[00:44:00]  It was really fantastic to watch how, even in that short amount of time of that story, how they got better at it.  Yeah.  And were able to do this.  And, you know, they used to have to bring the studio cameras, those giant studio cameras out on the street to actually get a live feed.  You could film it.  You could videotape it even, but you'd have to bring it back to the studio.  They had these giant live cameras.  And the police station, they had all access. 
[00:44:30]  The press was never told you couldn't be somewhere.  So the hallways, where they're bringing Oswald through into one of the homicide interrogation rooms, were lined with press.  And they're just shoving mics in his face and asking him stuff.  And he's talking.  And it was a scene where you're like, this just doesn't happen.  The press is restricted from everywhere.  The way they handle it, although you could see the early inkling of what was to come during those 72 hours or so, it was more of a â€“ I was more interested in how the news was handling it than the actual Kennedy story, which I had watched the special on an hour prior, which was pretty good. 
[00:45:00]  The best part of that â€“  What happened?  The best part of that â€“  I think he died, and people said it was more than one person.  They said it was a sneeze.  Yes.  He sneezed.  He didn't hold his head.  The best part of that story, though, like no one knew any better.  If there was a camera in your face, oh, I guess I got to talk and tell them everything I know.  That was another thing. 
[00:45:30]  There was no one that actually started the no comment yet.  Like, oh, man, they got me.  The camera's on.  All right, I did it.  I'm the murderer.  There was a police captain who, in no time, became so savvy of the camera.  Really?  They had set up all the microphones, and he was like â€“ he started his press conference, and he goes, oh, wait, we got another camera.  And he waited until that camera got set up and turned on and then started it.  And they said Kennedy himself was very savvy of the camera and the power of television and would often walk onto a podium where he had to speak, leave the airplane, set things up where Jackie had a big entrance. 
[00:46:00]  And he was just playing to the camera.  And that had such an impact on how people felt about him because, you know, he looked good, and he was able to make those big entrances.  And he was one of the first politicians that really used television like that.  Did they show Cronkite's announcement?  Yeah, they showed Cronkite's announcement where â€“ 
[00:46:30]  It was pretty smooth.  The glasses, and he teared up.  He teared up.  A couple of other guys were tearing up.  And then they showed the pictures of Oswald and video of Oswald being shot by Jack Ruby.  And there was one guy that took a picture, and they're developing it, and they're just going, oh, my God, this is amazing.  It's Jack Ruby running up to Oswald, and Oswald and the cops, not a clue anything's happening.  There's Ruby, gun pulled, pointing it right at Oswald, and they're just walking with these solemn looks on their face. 
[00:47:00]  And that was like the front page news picture.  And then this other guy goes through his film and goes, oh, wait a minute.  I got the second â€“ you know, the shot was fired, and that's the famous picture where he's, oh, you know, shot in the stomach.  And the cop's looking over like, oh, my God, did I screw up?  And again, this was one of those situations where they invited the press.  They had said 10 o'clock tomorrow.  You'll be here.  You'll be able to watch us lead this man out.  Here's a guy that apparently killed the president of the United States. 
[00:47:30]  They were putting him in an armored car because they were afraid of what would happen to him, and yet they invited the press down.  They invited people down there.  Which means they're inviting the killers as well.  Jack Ruby was just sending off a telegram and saw the crowd.  That was his story.  I saw the crowd and decided, you know, I'm going to go over there and see what happens.  And when I realized it was him, I was caught up with the emotion of what had happened to Kennedy and decided he was going to be a hero and shoot this guy. 
[00:48:00]  And save Jackie.  That's what he said, too.  He was talking about Jackie having to come back for a trial, and he started crying and saying, I just can't imagine her having to do that.  That's kind of a phony explanation.  It is kind of a phony explanation.  Yeah, there's the one picture that the guy had, and it's just them walking.  But, Ruby, look at that.  Gunn is there.  And then the next picture is the famous, you know, hey, I'm shot.  I don't think I've ever seen that picture on the left.  Let's put that up on onaradio.com. 
[00:48:30]  But great show.  It's on PBS, you know, forever.  I'll definitely check it out.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  Thank you, son.  I smell soup.  I smell soup.  Wow.  Quick check with us this chicken pot pie soup.  Is it good?  I'm ladling it into my fat face.  It's really good, yeah.  I'm jealous.  I want some of that.  It's ridiculously good.  Fresh soup from Quick Check. 
[00:49:00]  Look what we do.  This isn't even a commercial.  We're just happy you brought soup.  Thank you.  I love when sponsors do that.  Wow, it smells really, really good.  Bring it in.  This is the chicken pot pie soup.  God, it's so good.  Usually I want breakfast this time of the morning, but I'm smelling that soup.  Now I need some.  Let's say hi to Anthony, the trucker.  877-212-ON-A.  What's up, Anthony?  What's going on, gentlemen?  What are you hauling today, sir?  How are you guys doing today? 
[00:49:30]  Good evening.  What are you hauling today, sir?  Office furniture.  All right.  Ugh, boring.  Are you hauling that to the dumps?  Yeah, I had a line there, and then I stammered.  I'm delivering it.  See, because everyone's getting fired.  Why don't you keep talking?  Because you have something better than my stammering, I'm sure.  Everyone's getting fired.  I had a good line.  I blew it.  Go ahead, Anthony.  Screw me.  Blow it.  Anthony, I just wanted to ask you, have you ever been to South Jersey? 
[00:50:00]  Uh, yes.  Well, Jackson has a great gun club.  We just got indoor moving targets.  It's a little far for me to go to shoot.  It is, but if you're ever down there, it's a great experience.  I actually heard they're closing that gun club anyway, the one in Jackson.  Are they?  Yep.  I haven't heard that. 
[00:50:30]  Anthony, you waited.  I just wanted to tell you guys.  This guy's been on the phone for an hour for this.  I just wanted to tell you guys, thank you.  What are you going to do when they close, dude?  What am I going to do?  I'm just going to start shooting people.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, well, maybe they ought to stay open.  Yeah, stay open, guys.  All right, Anthony, thank you.  I'm good.  Thank you, gentlemen.  All right, bye, Anthony.  Thank you, gentlemen.  Oh, my God.  You totally nailed him.  How great was that?  Are they all?  I can't believe that worked.  My acting is getting better and better. 
[00:51:00]  What did I get yesterday?  It was a gem open.  It was good.  I had some good acting.  I was impressed.  You got me good yesterday.  Dennis Leary is going to be here in a few minutes.  He's promoting his book, Why We Suck, a feel-good guide to staying fat, loud, lazy, and stupid.  I don't like that type of talk.  No?  That's fresh.  It's a little harsh.  Is this the book that had the autism thing in it?  Yes.  And it's also...  Did they rip those pages out?  No.  Really?  No, good for them.  Yeah, right on.  Oh, this thing's going to sell, man.  Controversy sells.  It's chapter six? 
[00:51:30]  Autism Schmautism.  Oh, boy.  Oh, okay.  I never heard of that one.  Oh, I bet you there was a dilemma.  These books were all printed.  You know how this stuff works.  Get that chapter out of there immediately.  Yeah.  It's controversial.  But that thing is going to sell some more books for Dennis.  Yes.  And they're doing smart.  Leary's doing a signing tonight.  It's, I think, 630 at Borders, which is a good time to do it, because that's when people  are going home.  I did it...  Well, I decided to do 845.  That wasn't my choice. 
[00:52:00]  Tomorrow, he's doing Staten Island.  I was just at that Barnes & Noble, too, at 7 o'clock.  Yeah.  Those are two...  These are probably very big, leery markets.  Very cool.  Orders at 630 in Penn Station.  So what do you guys think about Hillary becoming Secretary of State?  Is this written in stone?  It's obvious.  It's going down.  It's not official yet, but this thing is happening.  Because Governor Patterson here in New York is trying to figure out who's going to take  her job.  So they're all, like, you know, already...  So you're keeping an eye on that situation? 
[00:52:30]  I don't bump.  I kind of like the fact that she is...  Yeah.  Well, that was a deal that was made a long time ago.  That's so obvious.  You think?  And why do these big announcements, they wait until everyone already knows before they make  the official announcement?  I don't get that.  This is going down.  Announce it.  Let's go.  Wow.  And I do think, yeah, this was something they worked on behind the scenes so she would drop  out.  Absolutely.  I'll give you...  I don't know if it was Secretary of State, but he probably sat her down and said, I'm  going to give you a nice position in my presidency. 
[00:53:00]  She's not known as a toughie when it comes to foreign affairs.  That's for sure.  She's another one of these.  We're just going to sit and talk with everybody and just...  I want to see who he appoints as Secretary of Defense.  I really am curious to see who gets that gig.  Is she soft, though, man?  I thought she was a little tougher than he was on foreign policy.  No, she's a tough bitch when it comes to screwing over people here in this country, and especially  New Yorkers, with her great agenda. 
[00:53:30]  You know?  She's one of those.  But as far as foreign affairs goes, I believe she'll be able to be pushed around.  Maybe.  She'll let her husband friggin' do whatever the hell he wanted to in the Oval Office.  How tough could she be?  She is the most bangable Secretary of State since Madeleine Albright.  Oh, yes.  Wow.  Madeleine Albright.  Would you?  Madeleine Albright?  Yeah.  If she wasn't Madeleine Albright, no. 
[00:54:00]  But to say that you...  But the fact that I can point her out on CNN...  Yeah.  I did that.  Tell people what she likes, whatever it was.  Some really bad...  Something bad.  Yeah, I hope Madeleine...  That would be really good.  I would put...  Because she has that stupid ascot she would always wear, that little scarf.  I would put her in the what the hell category.  What the hell.  Yeah.  I would go.  What the hell?  I would go for it.  Because you want to get the shock from your friends as you tell them.  You're getting...  But you're getting nothing out of it.  I understand.  Except the fact that, you know, it's a celebrity sighting underneath you. 
[00:54:30]  Right.  That's funny.  That's pretty much it.  I wonder if Madeleine Albright...  She probably likes, like, interracial videos and cuckolding situations.  Imagine if she liked watching stuff like that before getting a little frisky.  Clean me.  What?  Clean me.  I don't want to.  That was in a rate.  Clean me.  I don't want to.  A 24.5 million watch Obama on 60 Minutes this past Sunday. 
[00:55:00]  Best ratings in nearly a decade.  Everybody is interested in what he has to say.  Yeah, whether you like him or you don't, you do want to hear what he's saying.  That's for sure.  By the way, that black thing you're talking about yesterday...  Black thing I talk about what?  You know how the black person wouldn't get out of your way and stuff?  Oh, yeah.  I have a little report because I told you I would, like, you know, I would just kind  of, like, look around a little bit more.  Did you see something?  I was joking with a black woman on an elevator yesterday. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  And when I was down in Philly, a black guy leaning more toward gangster than businessman  held the door open for me.  That's all I have to report so far.  And then robbed you.  He's like the old lady with the...  That's all I have to report.  But the God's honest truth.  But I'm still looking around.  And I'm not trying to, like, you know, not prove your point.  This is what has happened to me so far.  You got any stories yet, Jimmy?  I honestly do what I've had.  And I'm always...  I'm on the lookout for discourtesy always just because I'm like... 
[00:56:00]  I like to feel slighted because it empowers me.  Yes.  Um, but I really have no...  I've noticed a noticeable difference.  Maybe it's just my vibe, but...  Yeah.  Here's what you ought to try for a week.  Nothing...  Don't allow anybody to be rude to you.  Okay.  But try, uh, noticing...  Be polite to people first.  Just see...  In a week's time.  Yeah.  That's how I test my perception sometimes.  Like, and I don't mean groveling, you know,  Hi, how are you?  God bless.  Let me hold the door.  Let me carry your stuff.  Uh-huh.  Just, uh, you know, oh, hello. 
[00:56:30]  You first.  Just see if you get any reaction that's different than you think.  Try it for a week.  All right.  I'll try that for an hour until I get sick of it.  But, no, don't do, like, a number thing.  Like, if you do it, like, so you have, like, 20 interactions,  and you're like, wow, only three were kind of dicks,  and that's probably better odds than normal.  Yeah.  Try it.  I mean, I could be wrong.  You gotta do that whole, like, old school tip the hat  and bow at the same time.  Yeah.  Like, the sweeping like this.  I know it's a visual, but...  Should I put my jacket over puddles and let me step over them? 
[00:57:00]  Why not?  Even if they're...  Chivalry.  Even if they're not walking by the puddle,  just throw your jacket in and put it back on.  And say, hey, see, I put a jacket across the puddle  and didn't even walk on it.  What kind of horrible relationship was that  where you'd have to put the muddy, filthy puddle water back on  and her heel was dry?  It's being chivalrous.  Women have walked all over us in many ways for too long.  Yeah.  This is what Obama had to say on 60 Minutes.  Just a quick clip.  There were a number of reasons that somebody might not have voted for me. 
[00:57:30]  But what was absolutely clear was that whether people voted for me or against me,  that they were making the judgment based on,  is this guy going to lead us well?  Is this guy going to be a good president?  And that was my assumption walking in,  and that's how it turned out.  And that's all good.  I got to disagree.  Not everybody made that assumption, my friend.  I got to disagree.  Whether you...  I'm liking this Obama guy.  That's just not true.  Hey, you weren't here yesterday. 
[00:58:00]  We went over some of the stats.  And percentage of black guys that voted for Obama was 90-what?  It was unbelievable.  95.  95.  And I understand black people in general will vote for the Democrat,  but I think those numbers are a bit higher than past elections.  And what was the whitey percentage?  43.  43.  So, you know...  See, isn't there a difference there?  And 50-what for McCain?  55% of the white vote went to McCain. 
[00:58:30]  So that's...  How much of the black vote?  That's 4%.  4%.  4%.  So, I mean, come on.  Barack, come on.  How...  Come on.  I mean, the numbers don't lie.  The numbers don't lie.  There isn't some kind of difference.  Actually, what we need to do is, like, see the numbers of past elections  and really compare.  But I think that the black...  It was...  The black people voting for Obama, that's got to be a bit higher than usual.  What's Clinton?  Can we check Clinton?  Bill Clinton's thing?  Yeah.  We can go back and pull those.  So, I mean, come on.  But the numbers were interesting, too,  because it was 50 million white voters voted for McCain, 
[00:59:00]  while 38 million voted for Obama.  Yeah.  Isn't that more than John Kerry got?  That is, right?  I think it is.  That's a lot of people, man.  I mean, I would be interested to see...  Too many couldn't see it, but, like, if he was a black Republican...  Honestly, I didn't think a black Democrat would get elected.  See, that I would like to see.  That would be...  It would have been an interesting...  Sure.  Right.  Let's say hi to Matt from the NYPD.  Matt, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I can't tell you how many times since Obama's been elected. 
[00:59:30]  We'll bring in some crackhead, and either him or his family from the lobby will be yelling,  we got Obama now.  This ain't going to last anymore.  But that's...  Isn't that just, like, a stupid thing somebody would yell?  Like, that's right up there with, like, McNabb had three touchdowns yesterday.  It's a crack addict yelling at you.  And, like, Obama's going to make crack legal now.  Like, I'm sorry.  All right, Matt. 
[01:00:00]  Matt's loving it.  You're enjoying yourself out there.  Very good.  Really.  Silly.  Hey, just a quickie, because I know we're going to get Dennis Leary on the radio in a few minutes here,  but the Somalian pirate, he seizes the giant Saudi oil tanker, right, that...  Where was he going to go with this?  Well, he's going to where they...  It's like a haven, a safe haven off of Somalia that these pirates go to and offload their booty.  Sure. 
[01:00:30]  Their booty.  But I believe they will be holding this whole ship hostage.  It's got 100 million barrels.  Yeah.  100 million dollars.  100 million dollars worth of oil, whatever that is.  Does he think he's going to get away with this?  They have been.  These pirates have been getting away with stuff.  No, I understand that.  An oil tanker?  They come across a British ship.  Those Brits, man, they love their naval battles.  Who did they...  What happened?  Pirates approached them?  Well, a pirate, they were trying to overtake some ship, and there was a British ship, 
[01:01:00]  a small, but a British military vessel in the area, and the pirates decided, we're going  to chase this ship away, and the Brits opened fire on the pirate ship, killing a number of  them, and making the rest put their little hands up and say, okay, we give.  Yeah, what are you doing, you dummies?  Yeah, they're in these little crappy boats.  They got RPGs and stuff, and machine guns, but how is any ship going off the coast of Somalia 
[01:01:30]  not armed?  Like, I don't know what the nautical are, what the rules are, but, you know, they should  have some protection, these guys, because they can't come out of nowhere.  It's not like they could hide behind something.  You're in the ocean, and if you see something speeding up to you, give them ample warning,  and then blow the crap out of them, out of the water.  Just make a big splash around their boat.  It'll capsize in them.  Yeah, they're in these nothing boats, and they're able to board these huge vessels. 
[01:02:00]  Come on.  It amazes me.  Now they're on an oil tanker heading toward some safe haven.  There's actually a safe haven in Somalia where pirate vessels go where you can't go there.  They will F you up.  No, they're getting the oil tanker back.  Yeah?  This guy's in deep doo-doo.  That's a lot of money.  He's going to be in a lot of trouble.  That's a big tanker.  I think it's like three times the size of an aircraft carrier.  Wow.  It's giant. 
[01:02:30]  How do you, you know, if I was the captain, it'd be like, okay, you steer this thing, dummy.  Yeah.  Let's see what you can do.  Let's see where you can take this.  And how are they going to get the oil off the thing?  They have like cups.  They're just going to like have a-  Cups.  They don't know what it's used for.  Yeah.  They're just going to drink it.  Yeah.  Put it in a big pot.  Big pools.  And put buona in it.  They're probably going to make big oil swimming pools.  Yeah.  They're oil pools.  A whole ship full of soda.  Yeah. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  There's big swimming pools with diving boards filled with oil.  Filled with oil.  Filled with oil.  They just, ugh.  Why not?  What are they going to do?  It's just, it's just ridiculous.  I don't see how this is happening so much over there.  There ought to be just a huge military presence there to just blow these things out of the  water.  They're just these savage frigging, uh, uh, criminals.  They are on the high seas. 
[01:03:30]  And what vessels going over there?  I understand.  You know, you got to cut it close when you're going around the Cape over there or whatever,  but for the love of God, stay away.  Those, those little, those little ships can't go too far out.  Yeah.  It'd be nuts.  What balls though.  It really is a ballsy move.  To take, that's a quarter of Saudi Arabia's daily export.  Wow.  You're balls to go, let's steal that.  Let's steal it.  Have they killed, have they killed anybody yet?  Oh yeah. 
[01:04:00]  Oh yeah.  They don't mess around.  They're good, they're good at that.  There have been almost a hundred attempts and 36 ships have been, uh, hijacked this year  alone.  What, the other 74, what, they fought them off?  Yeah, there were some that were fought off.  And the India has a few military vessels in there and they fought off an attack on like  a Philippines chemical tanker the other day.  A cruise ship, uh, got away once they got hit in the side with an RPG.  It just left like a scuff on the side.  And then, uh, they just went full speed ahead and outran them with a cruise ship. 
[01:04:30]  Why don't we go there and just slap them around?  Just slap them around for an afternoon.  They'll never do this again.  They should be.  Yeah.  They would never do this again.  I want to go there on a cruise.  Somalia?  Yeah.  Wouldn't that be fun?  Yes.  Just hanging off your, um, hanging off your balcony with a gun?  They give guns out to everybody.  Have fun, man.  You know, when you go on a-  Shoot the pirate game.  You know, when you go on a cruise, they just stop off in ports.  Imagine they just, all right, here we are.  Everyone off.  Somalia.  Everyone off the boat for the afternoon. 
[01:05:00]  I didn't know about the Somalia port.  Leave your genitals in this basket here.  Kind of like that scene from Jaws when that older couple's forced to go in the water  so everyone else goes in the water.  Why don't you take a swim?  I don't want to.  Stupid mayor.  I think that's the one place, because my manager, Jonathan, travels everywhere, and he travels  alone.  That's the only place he won't go?  I think he said it's the one place he would not go.  This got me a few hours.  No, no, he's crazy.  When are we going to get him on the show?  Whenever we want. 
[01:05:30]  He'll be on.  He's just-  We say that every time.  We've got to book him.  Well, yeah, he'll just come on.  He's just in L.A.  He's sleeping right now.  I've seen his pics one day with you.  It's just ridiculous.  He's a big child.  He makes scrapbooks.  What was the-  He makes giant scrapbooks.  Where was he when the king was parading, and it looked like an Idi Amin-type king?  He was in some African village.  I'm like, what are you, crazy?  I don't know.  And the king was in the back of a convertible.  Do you understand he has photos with rebels in the woods?  Yeah.  He literally does. 
[01:06:00]  And he was telling me how he had to pass from one country to another, and he bribed the  guy with a pen, but the guy was insulted and wanted his watch.  He gets into these weird situations.  Take the pen.  This guy does well in Hollywood, and when it's time to take a few days off, this is  what he does.  One story told us where he got on a plane with animals, because that's just how it is.  Some African airline where they're very, very, you know, it's obviously not a good airline.  It's one of those puddle jumper planes, and they go from village to village or what have 
[01:06:30]  you, and people board the plane with animals.  They just must fly those until they crash.  Yeah, they really do.  Like, I can't imagine there's any maintenance done on them.  They just fuel them up and fly them until they crash.  He said the security thing was broken, and he got on with, like, a bunch of knives, too.  But he was, I mean, it's amazing.  Yeah.  His, uh, you know, when you look at his office, and he's got a photo shaking hands with Castro.  Castro.  Wow.  Yeah, it's really creepy.  Is that a big photo, Jimmy?  It's one of the biggest? 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think Castro would be a big one.  Yeah.  And then there's, well, I told you the story.  Can you think of a bigger one?  Lennon.  John Lennon?  Castro ran a country.  Lennon sang a few songs.  Lennon walked around New York.  All right.  He's dead.  Dude.  Lennon.  The only reason, because he's dead.  Yeah, well, he got a Lennon Memorial in Cuba.  In a park.  Still, though.  Castro, much harder to get than Lennon.  Lennon.  No.  Lennon's the hardest.  He's dead. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, so that's what I'm saying.  You can't get dead people.  All right.  So then, Napoleon.  George Washington.  Let's say hi to Greg in Baltimore.  We can more.  Greg.  Hey, how you doing?  I saw a special not too long ago on Discovery Channel or something, but these people that  have these ships, they're not allowed to bring weapons on their ship for some kind of law  or reason.  I don't know why, but they had a new weapon out now that blasts out this real loud sound 
[01:08:00]  that they fought off.  This one ship they showed fought off these pirates.  But these guys go in there and just, you know, they kill these people and kidnap these captains  and stuff and then hold them up for millions of dollars.  That sound?  They usually always pay it.  Here's what you do then.  Water cannons, like in Waterworld.  Yeah.  Remember the atoll?  No evidence.  They had those big water cannons.  And then you could just pump the water right out of the ocean. 
[01:08:30]  And then you have a high-powered pump that just squirts it out.  And then you capsize the boats and leave them there.  Give them a salty treat.  Let them swim for the three seconds they know how to swim.  Yeah.  And then blub, blub right to the bottom.  All right.  Let's say hi to Brian.  Brian, how are you?  I just started a frunk.  I know.  I know.  I'm going to frunk us out.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  Brian?  Hey, boys.  I'm calling Bravo Sierra on that last caller because one of the big things in the private  contracting world right now is contracts to get on these boats. 
[01:09:00]  You have to be a qualified sniper and, like, ex-special forces and stuff.  But they have contracts out there now.  Well, where are they?  Yeah.  Well, if they're killing dudes, you ain't going to hear about it.  You'd think the Saudis would have it, though.  You'd think they would have all the precautions.  Saudi oil.  That much Saudi oil, you'd think they'd, yeah.  They'd have some guy on there.  How the hell do you board a tanker?  Do they let a rope down so the guy can come on board?  They threaten them with RPGs, I guess, or explosives, and say, you know, let us on. 
[01:09:30]  We're blowing your boat up.  It said they're so full they're real easy to board.  And this thing was loaded with two million barrels.  All right.  Jesus.  We love the Somalian pirate stories, that's for sure.  Quick break.  I think Dennis Leary's here.  We'll talk to him next.  His new book is Why We Suck.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, I love this.  Opie and Anthony, Dennis Leary's already off and running.  I am off and running. 
[01:10:00]  Talking about CBGBs.  My mic is not on.  Is it on?  I can't hear it.  Yeah, you're on.  Give me some headphone there.  Headphone here.  A little headphone volume for you, man.  Let's see.  CBGBs.  Hi.  You used to work there.  Hi.  No, I mean, I worked for bands that, oh, you had to, like, load and unload?  One of my career, I guess, actually, at that time, it was really what I did for a job.  Let's be honest, I was a roadie for many, many, no, I liked it, actually.  That's not a fun job.  Look, I was working for a guy, for a band. 
[01:10:30]  If you were doing it for Zeppelin, maybe.  As far as I was concerned.  It was Zeppelin.  It was Zeppelin because it was friends of mine's bands that, you know, Adam Roth, my guitar player.  Sure.  In my comedy band, we used to be called, I can't say the name of the band, the A-Hole band,  but now we've changed it to the Crown Royals featuring the rehab horns.  Our backup singers are called the Enablers.  The guys change the name of the band, they get tired, but anyways, Adam was in several  different bands, and I used to, and I was always working for my friends, you know, so  it was fun, but the subject was CBGBs. 
[01:11:00]  It's the legendary punk club.  They finally closed down because they couldn't keep it open anymore because they weren't paying  their bills, blah, blah, blah.  Right, and let's be honest, it was a, I don't know how that's called.  It was a crap hole.  It was a crap hole, as it should have been.  It was a famous punk and rock and roll club.  Yeah.  But, you know, now that it's closed and it's a John Varvatos clothing store, I'm really  happy because I like John Varvatos' stuff, plug, and I like going in there, but, you  know, back in the day, it was a great rock and roll club, but it was $7 at Budweiser in 
[01:11:30]  1978, and he never paid people the amount of money they were supposed to get paid, and  like all club owners, that's as it should be.  Yeah.  But I'm not going to, you know, like when Patti Smith was protesting outside the place  with all these people, and they were going to close it down, saying, save CBGBs.  CBGBs.  Now, put in a clothing store.  Why save it?  Yeah.  I went to the bathroom in there, you know, when there was no door and no seat on the toilet.  Yeah.  Come on.  Where was the money for the seat on the, how much does it cost to buy a toilet seat?  Yeah.  Okay.  The Ramones, you know, soda water money.  You know, of course, they never drank that stuff when they were playing. 
[01:12:00]  You could have bought a toilet.  They could have brought a toilet seat from Brooklyn.  And it always looked like a baboon had gone in there and just flung feces around.  Hey, listen, they were, the baboons were a great band.  The fact that they didn't know how to go to the bathroom was not their fault.  The Ramones.  The funny part is, all these like big rock guys protesting CBGBs, closing, one of those  guys should just bought the damn thing.  They can afford it.  Keep it open.  Debbie Harry was outside, right?  I don't know.  I wasn't there. 
[01:12:30]  I wasn't there.  I was at the other protest across the street saying, open a clothing store.  Now.  That is New York.  You got the old time New Yorkers trying to keep this city like, you know, like it was  when they first moved here, I guess.  Yeah.  Get some crap.  Hey, listen, listen.  I was here.  I wasn't living here until sometime in the 80s.  I was splitting my time between Boston and New York.  But I was here a lot in the late 70s and obviously a lot in the 80s.  And it sucked.  Let's be honest.  There were crackheads everywhere.  There used to be a guy named Angel on my block on first and ninth. 
[01:13:00]  He was great.  He was the local drug dealer.  But also you could tell him like, hey, here's an extra 10 bucks.  Watch my car.  And he'd sit on your car and deal drugs.  So, I mean, there were nice things about it.  But it sucked.  Because you had to tell people to watch your car, though.  Exactly.  Remember the no radio signs?  That was, yeah.  No radio.  No radio.  No seats.  No floor.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Yeah.  No battery.  You had to put a sign on.  You had to come out in the morning to go to work with like a car battery under one arm, 
[01:13:30]  your stereo under the other, the steering wheel, the friggin' steering wheel then had  the, what was that thing called?  The club.  The club on it.  Yep.  Yeah.  And the other one that went down to the brake pedal.  But don't you think the criminals were on to us when everyone started doing the no radio  sign?  No.  You know what it was?  They were so hyped up on crack.  Yeah.  And crack was so cheap that it really wasn't just that.  Remember, I remember you started with the no radio signs and then you had to really get  down to like, there's nothing in this car.  Because they would steal anything if it was worth five bucks. 
[01:14:00]  A pack of cigarettes they would steal to sell the guys to get crack.  Yeah, you couldn't leave it on your dash or anything.  A pack of cigarettes out there.  The good old days, though.  It was an adventure out there.  Your change from the toll money left in the console.  It's true.  It was true.  Just a dopey kid from Long Island.  I would go to Times Square and see the pimps, the whores, the drug dealers, get my fake ID.  The good old days.  Now it's Disneyland down there.  Like Taxi Driver.  It was like...  It was completely like that.  The steam coming out of every hole in the street and hookers everywhere.  You were a dopey kid from Long Island? 
[01:14:30]  Still am.  Who knew?  Still am.  I'm trying up.  Who knew?  I still am.  You know, I just watched King of Comedy again.  I love that movie.  And they had a shot at Times Square.  And that movie was only, what, mid-80s?  82, I think.  Is it 82?  Yeah, it's pretty early.  After Raging Bull.  Oh, all right.  Then never mind.  Because they showed Times Square and it was still very, very gritty.  It was close to Raging Bull.  Yeah, I think it was De Niro's movie right after it or Scorsese's.  Oh, I thought it was later.  Okay, whatever.  But the book, Dennis, come on.  The book, baby. 
[01:15:00]  Why We Suck.  A Feel-Good Guide to Staying Fat, Loud, Lazy, and Stupid.  Yes.  I'm very proud of this book.  Are you over the autism controversy?  Well, I have a couple things I'd like to say about that.  Really?  Yeah.  Louis C.K. wrote that chapter.  Louis's like, thank you, thank you, thank you.  Yeah, if there's anything else in the book you don't like, Bill Hicks wrote that.  Yeah.  I want to talk about Louis C.K. for a second, okay?  Yeah.  Then we'll get into autism.  Apparently, somebody has contacted Louis. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, he's told the story on our show.  Oh, and so I heard about it, I didn't hear it.  Somebody contacted, Eddie Brill from the Letterman Show, who's an old friend of mine, contacted  Louis and said, hey, Chris Phillips wrote the A-Hole song with Dennis, and actually,  it was Chris's idea.  He's the one who came up with the riff, and it tumbled out of our heads.  And when he told Louis, Louis said, oh my gosh, I should call Chris Phillips and apologize.  No call to me, though.  Apparently, the lines that Chris wrote in the A-Hole song are fine, but I stole all  the lines I wrote from Louis C.K. 
[01:16:00]  Wow.  And Louis, by the way, the money I gave you to make that movie was not guilt money.  I had no idea you thought I stole your material.  I actually believed in you as a filmmaker.  Period.  That's the end of that story.  What movie did you give him money to?  I don't even want to get into it.  I gave him money to make a movie, because I believed him as a filmmaker.  Apparently, he said on your show that he thought it was blood guilt money.  Yeah, okay.  You know what's funny?  We do our show every day, and I swear to God, I vaguely remember Louis saying that there's 
[01:16:30]  a problem with the A-Hole song with Dennis Leary, and now I've got to go listen to what  Louis said to bring it all together.  No, you don't have to listen to it.  Whatever.  All right.  I just wanted to say it publicly.  As far as the autism thing goes, and I hope there's people out there listening up,  you know, before the autism thing broke in the New York Post, which is a paragraph taken  out of context from the autism chapter.  They never do that.  Yeah.  I got a review from Publishers Weekly, which is a way in advance review. 
[01:17:00]  They gave the book a four-star review, which is a big thing for a comedy book or any book  from Publishers Weekly.  Sure.  And they, amongst other things, called it wildly entertaining.  If they, these are respectable people, if they thought I was slamming autistic kids,  I think they would have cited it.  So, they didn't.  They gave it a great review.  Here's the deal.  The chapter, the paragraph in particular that talks, that people think is about autistic  kids and their parents, is not about autistic kids and their parents.  It's about people who are trying to get low-level diagnoses. 
[01:17:30]  This is a real issue in the autism community.  For their kids who have things like ADD, or in general, are badly behaved.  So, inattentive parents are now, believe it or not, trying to get their kids diagnosed  and designate it as special needs, so they have a way to explain away their bad parenting  and why their kids misbehaved.  Now, if you, and in the chapter, I talk about just one in particular autistic child that I  know, that I've known her whole life, and how offensive it is to me that people would  think that they could jump on this boom in autism and get their kids included. 
[01:18:00]  You know?  Well, that is taken out of context.  That's a little different than what we read, man.  And I talk about Asperger's syndrome and people who really have that, and then, in particular,  I talk about Augustin Burroughs' brother, who, in my opinion, I read his book, and I  listened to him get interviewed on the radio, had self-diagnosed himself after he made tons  of money as a kiss roadie and technical whiz.  You know, that's what I'm talking about, okay?  And it's part of this whole victim thing.  It's like, and I talk about SADD, too, a seasonal affective disorder.  People say, oh, when the leaves fall off the trees, I get really depressed, and I eat  a lot, and I sleep a lot, and I drink too much, and I, you know, yeah, it's called 
[01:18:30]  winter, okay?  We all have that problem.  That's why we invented skiing and ice hockey.  So, anyways, once this thing took off, you know, it was impossible to get people, and  it may still be impossible for me to get people to realize what I was really talking about.  But just to put it in perspective, like I said, I think if you read the book, and I've  actually heard from people now who have read the chapter, because we put it out through  Autism Speaks, through their organization, online, so people could read it, who have,  complete strangers from the autism community who have contacted me to say, I know exactly what 
[01:19:00]  you're talking about.  This is a problem.  This is an issue.  This is one of those things that just goes on, because, you know, the real problem is  they don't have federal funding or health insurance coverage.  These people have to actually sue back against their own school districts to try to get the  money that they spend, because, you know, kids who are really autistic need to have hands-on  teaching.  They need to have a one-to-one ratio or a three-to-one ratio.  So, that's what the real issue is, and that's why I found it so offensive that there were people  that were saying, you know what? 
[01:19:30]  I want to get my kids included in this, because, you know, that way I can explain why my kids  are misbehaving, et cetera, et cetera.  That's not my fault.  You know?  Jenny McCarthy, bad math.  I know she's involved in it.  Oh, and you can't, everybody bad math.  Everybody, man.  Okay, and just in terms of human math, you guys know I do this Cam Neely benefit every  year.  We just did, I said this on stage Saturday night, because we just did our 14th one.  Thomas Come Home.  I said, because my local newspaper, the Boston Herald, had slammed me as well.  I said, why would I, on a Saturday night in Boston, for the 14th time, raise money to 
[01:20:00]  help kids with cancer, and then on Tuesday, publish a book that attacks autistic kids?  It doesn't make any sense.  So, from the beginning, I said, read the book.  Read the book, and then tell me.  Now, it's still possible that I may not have worded it correctly enough for everybody to  get it, but there's no way I'm talking about autistic kids, kids who are truly autistic,  and their parents dealing with that issue.  But even if, here's the thing, the problem with everybody, you're a comedian, and even  if you are making fun of that stuff, it's allowed.  Well, that was my other argument. 
[01:20:30]  It's allowed.  It's a comedy book.  I'm a comedy doctor.  I'm discussing autism, not defining it.  But, you know, by the way, as a comedian, where's the point of view in making fun of autistic  kids?  There is none.  Your point of view is in the ridiculous part of it, which is, these parents, whose kids  are misbehaving, and whose kids are self-indulged, and these kids, these parents going and trying  to get these kids included in a low-level part of that spectrum, that's offensive, and therefore  needs to be, I mean, to me, that's the comedy target. 
[01:21:00]  You know what I mean?  But it's like, nobody says to Stephen King, why did you write a book where the clown murders  children?  Nobody says that because they understand there's an entertainment value in a clown murdering  children.  Did he write a book about a clown murdering?  Oh, yeah, man.  That son of a bitch.  Who does he think he is?  He likes killing kids.  But you understand, they don't question that, but comedians, for some reason, we always have  to explain away, and all of us have to do it, why we decided to poke fun at something.  Everybody should just drop dead.  When you know it's dead in humor, all bets are off, whether you like it or not. 
[01:21:30]  By the way, I think I have no answer for why the newspaper misquoted it.  Because they suck.  But here's my belief.  I think because when you look at the chapter titles in Why We Suck, you know, hey, look, you  know, I knew what I was doing.  There's a lot of funny chapter titles.  They're great.  And there's a lot.  Listen, you could take the chapter, Please Drug Your Children.  That's one of the titles in one of the chapters.  You could take that one and say that I'm trying to drug everybody's kids.  You could take We'd Hate You Even If You Weren't Black and say I'm a racist. 
[01:22:00]  I'm not.  And I discuss racism in the chapter.  But if you're just going through the book and picking things out, it's easy to take things  out.  How about Famous Dead Kids or Kids Are Not Cute?  By the way.  I love the chapter names.  Famous Dead Kids is one of my favorites, because that discusses all these, it's talking  to parents about, please don't put your kids in show business, you know, until they're adults.  Right.  You know, because I just list all the dead kids.  Famous Dead Kids.  All the famous dead kids just in our lifetime.  Yeah.  Really, there's two who have survived as professionals, Ron Howard and Jodie Foster. 
[01:22:30]  And then there's a number of kids from Bonaduce through Todd Bridges.  I actually go through Todd Bridges his whole life, where his career started and all the  legal lawsuits between his parents and his criminal record.  I mean, when you put all that stuff on paper, all these kids, it's unbelievable.  Dana Plateau.  All of them.  I mean, you know, Gary Coleman.  But there's a lot of them that died, you know?  Yeah.  They either killed themselves or, you know, ended up accidentally killing themselves, you  know?  I'm sorry, but you got flack, too, for the title of Matt Dillon's a big fag. 
[01:23:00]  You're friends with Matt, aren't you?  Yeah.  And here's the idea behind that.  Another one.  That's another one in the post quote.  That chapter's about how guys talk to each other.  The post again.  What a surprise.  How we nickname each other.  Yeah.  And how women don't.  You know how women never have nicknames for each other?  As a matter of fact, they call each other by their full name or by, you know, Meg.  If Meg's her nickname, they call her Meg.  But they never call, like, they don't do last names.  Hey, Leary.  Hey, Norton.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And we call, you know, I can say that.  Yeah, yeah, in that context. 
[01:23:30]  We call each other fags all the time, right?  Hey, you big fag, whatever.  And it's all about, that's, you know, how guys refer to each other.  Yeah.  And if a guy's missing a left eye, you call him either righty or lefty.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, so anything that goes wrong with a guy, if a guy has, you know, cancer of the testicles  and loses one, you know, you.  One ball.  Yeah, one ball.  That's the way we work, right?  That's how we work.  Of course we do.  That's what that chapter's about.  We're not allowed to do that in society anymore.  And the Post, by the way, even went out of their way to say that not only that was that  controversial, but that the homosexual community was up in arms about it, and that the interview 
[01:24:00]  with the advocate that I did was a negative interview, when in fact they loved the book.  Oh, good.  I mean, it's unbelievable, the stuff that they, you know.  Oh, God.  Just either out of context or just straight out lying.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  The whole thing with calling your buddy a fag or a faggot, that got way out of hand  because that would, you never meant it sexually.  No, no.  It was always like, as a matter of fact.  It's like, you want to go out?  What are you doing?  You're going to stay in tonight?  Don't be a faggot. 
[01:24:30]  Get in the car and let's go.  You know, my brother, my older brother, Kiwi.  Kiwi?  Why Kiwi?  Small one?  I'll tell you that story in a little bit.  But my brother Kiwi, he's in, there's a lot of stuff in the book about Kiwi and growing  up.  Yeah.  And we always had to share a room.  We started in the attic when my parents had an apartment in the third store of a third  story of a three-decker.  My brother and I lived in the attic like bats.  And then when they moved, we lived in the basement of my mom's house.  So, my brother and I were always in this tiny space and just beating the crap out of each 
[01:25:00]  other.  But we literally, for about 15 years, we never said each other's names.  We just called each other faggot and fag.  Hey, fag, let's go.  It's time to go to school.  Faggot, get up.  Hey, faggot, where's my record?  Where's my shirt, faggot?  You know, that's what we called each other.  Yeah, yeah.  So, that's in the book a million times.  That's awesome.  You know?  My brother would call me faggot at the dinner table and my parents wouldn't bat an eye.  Of course not.  That's just how it was.  The big fag took my thing.  Hey, the little fag took my thing.  You know, that's how we refer to each other.  All of my friends were a bunch of fags.  Oh, yeah.  Like, hey, what are you doing? 
[01:25:30]  My brother had a football team, a pickup football team called the fags.  They had shirts that said the fags on it.  You know, come on.  Hey, we got a sign.  By the way, some of my best friends are fags.  Yeah, there you go.  I've known Mario Cantone since...  Oh, forever.  ...1975.  And both of my coworkers are.  Easy.  Hey!  You can't prove that.  Assad of Boston has.  Hey, by the way, Jim, did you have a second book come out?  Yeah, he did.  I'm such an idiot.  I was...  I was...  I'm going to admit to this. 
[01:26:00]  Uh-oh.  Yeah, I've never had a book out before.  So I just thought I was going to...  You know, last night I was sitting there and I go, hey, this is kind of a big moment for  me.  I order all my stuff off Amazon, right?  I ordered my own book.  Nice.  Just so I'm...  It's like voting.  I wanted to vote for myself.  Anyways, when I...  This is so funny.  When I punched in, you know, the one click, cling, clang, Dennis Leary, you've ordered  Dennis Leary, what...  You might like.  They said, you might like.  The first one up is your second book.  And I went, Jesus, Jim has a book.  Wow.  I'm...  They think...  As soon as I order this thing, it goes right to Jim Norton. 
[01:26:30]  That's great for Jim.  Hopefully that's good for me.  You just made Jimmy's day.  Thanks.  Yeah.  Bye, Dennis's...  When did that come out?  Uh, two weeks ago.  Oh, so it's you, me, and Artie Lang fighting it out in the bookstores.  Yeah, I mean...  You sons of bitches.  How dare you?  I'm happy, though.  You guys can spread these out a little bit.  No, they...  A week apart's good, though.  Look, I hit the list.  Uh, you'll certainly hit it.  Artie will hit it.  Look, uh...  What list?  Bestseller list.  Um...  How many books do you have to sell to be on the bestseller list?  I don't know, because I know the competition is disgusting.  Wait, wait.  You were on the bestseller list with the first book.  Yeah, that's just what I do. 
[01:27:00]  I mean, I'm glad I'm on the bestseller list.  You know, it's my thing.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  So, you don't know how many books do you have to sell to be on the bestseller list?  I never asked.  I probably should ask.  I don't know how it works.  I don't know.  So, this one that you have out now is going to go on the bestseller list.  It's for the November 23rd paper.  It's on the Times bestseller list, which ends this week.  Okay, now...  See, I'm going to get screwed here.  No, you're not.  Yes, I am.  You're on the bestseller list.  Artie's going to get on.  And then, you know, I'm going to be the man up there.  You'll be there.  It doesn't work that way, though, because this week, I don't know if I'll stay on the list.  Right. 
[01:27:30]  Like, last year, I was on for five weeks, but I was on for four, and then I came off  the list, and then I came back on.  It happens like that.  You'll definitely get on it.  Dennis Leary.  Everybody knows who you are.  See, that's the problem.  You got a lot of press around.  I knew your book was coming out.  I thought your book was already out.  You were getting so much people talking about the book.  See?  That's what's going to happen.  Jimmy.  Oh, the book's not available anymore.  It's been out for too long.  Could you give sympathy to the guy with the hit TV show?  That's what I'm saying.  You're doing a signing.  They took out a big...  You're smart.  He's doing a signing tonight, and the signings are good.  You should do them, because they really do help with sales.  That's what they told me.  Actually, you know what they told me, Jimmy? 
[01:28:00]  You're going to love to hear this.  They said, Jim Norton did this.  He did this book signing, then he did this book signing, and he went to Chicago.  That's why I'm going to Chicago, because of you.  I did all that last year.  It helped a lot, too, man, because you're going to do an independent store, too, probably.  I don't know if you're doing one in Jersey, if you're doing...  I don't know.  They should be doing independent stores, but they're fun to do, and people do.  Word of mouth, man.  It helps the book sales a lot.  It certainly does.  I'm going to tell you, that intro to your first book is one of the classic comedy book  things of all time, the Colin Quinn book. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, yeah.  It's great, right?  And he didn't read the book, and then he did read the book.  That was really funny.  That was very, very clever.  I still hear people talking about that.  Yeah.  Colin was just great.  You know, two pages.  It was just the perfect introduction.  You hanging for a while?  Yeah.  Why?  Do I have to leave?  No.  We don't want you to.  We're making sure you...  Well, we've got to take a break.  Let me plug Dennis and sign you real quick.  Tonight, 6.30.  You're smart tonight, because you're doing it.  6.30 is a good time at Borders and Penn Station.  It's like you hop on the train.  You just go there.  It's a perfect time to get your book, and you get it signed.  It's a great place for a signing. 
[01:29:00]  I did mine there, but I did it later like an idiot.  And I'm happy to see, because I did follow the controversy in the press.  Did you guys read this book, by the way?  We just got it yesterday.  They delivered them yesterday afternoon.  Yeah, but I mean...  Give us a copy.  I would have read the whole thing.  How about Lydia Will sends me one?  You could have read it last night.  No, we got it...  Today.  I shouldn't even say yesterday.  We were handed these about...  It meant for you guys.  And I said to Steve, when did these get here?  And he goes, they were delivered yesterday afternoon.  Really?  Yeah.  But I do want to say, because the controversy, it was following in the press. 
[01:29:30]  I like the pictures.  So I get the book today, and I open it up, and I'm proud to say the autism chapter is  still in here, because I'm like, watch what happens.  They're going to yank it out of the phone.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I never...  And I'm so happy that's in here.  No, because listen, you know what?  I apologized to...  Good.  I mean, I did it privately as well, but I apologized in public with a statement that...  I didn't ever apologize for what I wrote.  I apologized for the fact that it was perceived a certain way, and for the effect that that  had on these families.  So, like I said, I mentioned this one family and this one child, and... 
[01:30:00]  You know how things go.  All of a sudden, they would rip the chapter out.  It's like, good.  Well, no, it's not.  It's in there.  We're happy.  I wanted to do what it was.  Good.  My intentions were clear.  All right, more with Dennis Leary.  Why We Suck is the new book, A Feel-Good Guide to Staying Fat, Loud, Lazy, and Stupid.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Opie and Anthony, we got Dennis Leary in studio.  We could talk to you all day, Dennis.  Really?  Ah, we'd love when you come in.  Why We Suck, A Feel-Good Guide to Staying Fat, Loud, Lazy, and Stupid is the name  of the new book.  It's going to do very, very well. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, and it got crap already from these morons who took it out of context and stuff, but...  Boy, what a surprise.  That's great, though.  I mean, that's what you kind of want when a book comes out.  You want people talking about it.  Well, you know, I didn't want people talking about it under that...  You know, when I wrote it, obviously, and when it was getting ready to be sent out to  people, I wanted people...  I mean, look, I've never been accused of being a middle-of-the-road comic.  I know I'm provocative and I'm shocking and I'm...  A lot of things, but stupid is...  I've been incredibly stupid in my personal life, and my mom and my wife and my kids can 
[01:31:00]  tell you lots of stories about it, and even Lenny, about how stupid I've been, but as  a comic, I've never been stupid.  You know, so I wanted to provoke and I wanted to...  Like I said before, there's no comedy point of view in making fun of kids who have autism.  I wouldn't write a chapter about making fun of kids with autism, because to me, you know,  where is the funny part there?  There is a funny part to be found when people are trying to jump on, you know, the boom in 
[01:31:30]  autism and get their kids included on the part, the outside part of the spectrum.  You know what I mean?  So that's what I was talking about.  And there are going to be people that will never, ever understand the point of view of this  chapter, because they will have only reacted and seen what they first saw, and I can't  do anything about those people, but, you know, I just want to make it clear to people  what my intentions were and what I was really writing about.  And like I said, to me, one of the best examples is Publishers Weekly, of somebody that published  a review of the book, you know, about a week before this New York Post thing happened. 
[01:32:00]  They never even mentioned autism, because obviously in the context of the book, they knew how  everything fit together.  And the great thing, though, is that it's written down.  So it's like whenever they take a verbal quote out, it's kind of hard to get people to go  get the audio, but it's like, hey, dummy, here it is.  It's written down.  Just read it.  Right.  It's like they can't get around the fact that they didn't read it if they didn't read  it, because it's not going to change.  Well, there's not much you can do about it.  And by the way, there's plenty of other, you know, people in the book to be offended by what 
[01:32:30]  I wrote, and hopefully there will be, because, I mean, to me, you know, like the chapter  on racism, man, you know, I start out by talking about the stereotypes and the whole politically  correct thing, which tries to erase the facts that we all know about each other.  Right.  Ethnic background, racial background, whatever.  You know, all these stereotypes that we've had for years that apparently now no longer  exist.  Yeah, they all outweigh.  And we write them like Irish people don't drink and beat each other up, right?  Listen, I'm Irish.  I have some experience with that. 
[01:33:00]  So I spent a whole chapter talking about that, because I started, the reason I wrote  that chapter was because I had it in the back of my head, and I was sick and tired of hearing  about it.  And then Naomi Campbell, when she got arrested on that plane, tried to claim that it was  racism.  Yeah.  You know, that actually they were racist, and that's why they lost her bags and everything  else.  And that's where I started, you know, taking Naomi's case on and then just running down the  line as to, you know, what makes us different is part of what makes us.  It's, you know, what makes this country so great. 
[01:33:30]  It's also what makes us funny.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Years ago in the Post, actually, I wrote a piece.  I just remembered this now.  It's in the chapter.  They asked me to write a piece about St. Patrick's Day, right?  I didn't have a book coming out.  This is, God, this is probably 12, 13 years ago.  I wrote a thing about the St. Patrick's Day parade.  I have it framed somewhere in my office.  It was a two-page spread, and it was basically about a bunch of Irish guys who go to the parade  and get drunk and beat each other up and end up getting arrested with their  Puerto Rican friend whose face is painted green, right?  And the Irish Anti-Defamation League threatened to sue me because of the New York Post. 
[01:34:00]  How are they going to sue you?  Right.  And my response was, I sent them a letter, and I said, listen, if you want to take me  to court, that's fine, but I'll just get the news channels from the last, like, 20 years  since the invention of the news to get me footage of Irish guys.  You know, I've been there.  Yeah.  You know, beating the crap out of each other with their faces painted green.  I'll even get some Puerto Rican guys that'll join in.  And they backed off because they knew there was footage.  This footage is probably for, yeah, get ready for the footage from this year. 
[01:34:30]  I mean, it's just that there's things that are true, and there's things that people wish  wasn't true, but it's, you know.  Yeah, that's just the way it is.  By Naomi Campbell, nobody hates you because you're black, okay?  People might hate you because you're beautiful or because you're a bitch, but they don't  hate you because you're black.  You can't hit people with phones and, you know, and expect to get away with it.  It has nothing to do with being black, okay?  She's like a Sesame Street character.  She walks down the street.  There's just a giant sea over her head at all times.  She's the worst overprivileged snot. 
[01:35:00]  You know, Dennis, if they give you a flag, I don't know if you want to get this harsh,  but you should say, oh, go jump in the lake.  Jimmy, calm down now.  Don't get me started.  Wow, you're out of your mind.  You got a whole chapter on the Olympics.  You call it the A-hole Olympics.  Yes.  You weren't a fan?  Well, it's not just these Olympics.  Just in general?  It's actually, it's taking the Olympic premise and saying, why can't we have an Olympics for  all, not just the athletes, but, you know, all the A-holes.  Right.  Rush Limbaugh, you know. 
[01:35:30]  I think there's something that we can broadcast it.  It can be pay-per-view.  We can make money off it, give it to charity, you know what I mean?  There's plenty of A-holes out there, especially in this country.  Right.  So, you know.  Yeah.  There's tons of them.  And also, a lot of the book is about my mom, when you guys get a chance to read it, because  my mother is sort of the through line.  I was talking about raising children and how we all were raised with the sense of right  and wrong.  And I don't know about you guys, but in where I was brought up, you know, if you wanted  self-esteem, you had to actually earn it.  Like, if you wanted a trophy, you had to win it. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  Not everybody got a trophy.  Thank you.  We talk about that all the time.  You didn't hit the baseball off the tee.  You actually learned how to hit a baseball that was thrown by another guy.  Thank you.  So that if it hit you in the face and crushed your face, you knew to not crowd the plate.  Those were the days, right?  Thank you.  And we kept score because we learned that losing sucks.  You know what I mean?  So with self-esteem, now you have a generation of kids.  I mean, I work with a couple of these guys where they don't understand why everything  they do doesn't get a round of applause.  Because what you did just sucked.  I ruled when I was a kid.  But no, you didn't. 
[01:36:30]  But we understand that.  We talk about that a lot on our show.  How did it get through, though?  How did we accept this?  I didn't accept it.  Every kid is a winner.  My little nephew plays football.  They've got a rule if one team's up by too much, they take the offense out and have  to put the scrubs in to play offense.  It's like, that's insane.  What are you playing for?  Exactly.  In the end, what are you playing for?  Yeah, seriously.  And if the score gets too crazy, then you don't even play offense until the other team  gets the score down.  So now you're playing defense the whole time until they finally score. 
[01:37:00]  So you're teaching the kids to let them score because you really want to play offense.  Everything's great.  Anything you do is great.  Well, not everything you do is great.  Not when you're in the real world.  That's when these kids are going to be really surprised.  But I think that's one of the big problems right now, which is what I talk about in the  book.  And my mom, what I did is I called my mom up.  And I didn't want to tape record her.  So I told her, Mom, I'm calling you.  I'm writing this book.  And first, she was like panicked.  She was like, what are they, fire from the TV show?  What happened to the movies and the TV show?  I was like, no.  They're paying me money.  You get those calls.  It's nice to know.  It's unbelievable.  Those calls. 
[01:37:30]  I get those, too.  Everything's okay, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, don't worry.  The checks will keep coming.  You're not doing that St. Patrick's thing again, are you?  All moms are the same, right?  You know, it's funny.  We just did this tribute to George Carlin because he got the Mark Twain Award in Washington.  And there was a clip that Jon Stewart interviewed him years ago.  And they ran this clip.  And he talked about the same thing.  He said when he first did Class Clown and he took on the Catholic Church and the Seven  Dirty Words, his mother was really pissed off, right?  And, you know, there's nobody more against organized religion than George Carlin. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  But apparently, he's from Morningside Heights, you know?  Apparently, his mother was walking around one day and there were a couple of younger  nuns from the parish.  And she got into a conversation and they asked how George was doing and she apologized to  the nuns, you know, for George.  And they said, actually, you know, some of the stuff we've seen, you know, your son do  on TV, you know, he's kind of making this point.  He's saying this and this and this about those words.  And, you know, yes, they're dirty words, but he has a point.  And then she was like, oh.  And she called George and said, the nun said it's okay what you're doing. 
[01:38:30]  So, I mean, it's hysterical.  Now she was okay with it, right?  But you still have the mom giving you either crap or...  Well, my mother, I actually ended up, you know, I make fun of Dr. Phil.  I make fun of a lot of different things in this book.  But for child rearing, I would call my mom.  I'd say, Mom, you know, what about this?  I don't remember this, but...  And she kind of, she threw out the book.  And at the end, I turned in the book and the A-hole Olympics was the last chapter.  And the publisher said, you can't end the book this way.  You got to call your mom again and wrap it up.  And I'm not kidding you.  After I made fun of Dr. Phil and raising kids and everything else, 
[01:39:00]  I called my mom up and it's in the book.  I transcribed it as I was talking to her.  And when I got off the phone, I'd make sure I remembered everything that she said.  Dr. Phil was blasting in the background.  It's the last chapter in the book.  I couldn't even hear her.  I said, what are you watching?  She's like, oh, Dr. Phil.  And she goes on this whole rant about Dr. Phil.  It's in the book.  So it was almost like a kismet.  You know what I mean?  It's like, worked out nice.  So why was she watching Dr. Phil just so she could hate him?  My mom...  Because I watch stuff just so I could hate it. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  See, my mom, because my mom's 81 and literally she walks five miles a day.  She's going to live to be 126.  She never smoked.  She never drank.  Right?  She's a lunatic.  She's about, you know, five foot two.  And my mother, you'll see in the book...  How did that happen?  And she's just one of the funniest, you know, women you'll ever meet.  But she's from Ireland.  She's from the countryside.  She doesn't...  There's no bull about my mom.  She just...  Like, if you walk...  When she describes the grandchildren, if you walked in and there was six grandchildren,  she literally goes, that's the smart one. 
[01:40:00]  That's the dumb one.  We don't know if he's retarded or not.  He can run fast and he writes pretty good.  Like, she just is a cut to the chase type person.  Yeah, good.  So, what was my point?  Where was I going with this?  I don't know.  That was funny.  Oh, I asked if she watches Dr. Fett.  Oh, oh, yeah.  So, she raised all these kids.  My kids and my nieces and my nephews.  And my son, Jack, is about 18 years old now.  And a bunch of the cousins are in that same general age group.  So, when they were growing up, they watched Cribs, Pimp My Ride, The Osborne Show. 
[01:40:30]  This is what...  They watched MTV all the time.  And my mom would watch it with them.  So, my mom literally, her favorite show at one point was The Osborne's.  Her second favorite show was Pimp My Ride.  So, my little Irish mother would go, I think that Ozzy Osbourne's a good father.  And I'd go like, my, you're kidding me, right?  She's like, no, they make fun of him too much.  And then she'd talk about Pimp My Ride.  Did you see the one where they took the thing?  Did you see that house that Puff Daddy lives in?  This is my mother.  Unbelievable.  As long as she's not saying Snoop Dogg, I could see how a girl could fall for him. 
[01:41:00]  I never asked her about Snoop Dogg.  She might be a fan.  Who knows?  So, I was asking you off mic.  Rescue me.  You're killing us.  It's been way too long.  When are the new episodes hitting?  We're still shooting.  We're halfway through.  Season five, right?  It's season five and season six combined.  So, it's one big...  Nice.  It's 22 or 24 episodes.  And we're gonna...  You're gonna run them like just...  One after the other.  So, no break in between?  No.  It comes out in April.  It runs all the way through into the fall.  Oh, how great is that?  And I can't...  I'm biased.  I'm obviously involved in the process.  But we really feel this is the best season we've ever done. 
[01:41:30]  And the actors are all popping.  I was telling you guys off...  During the commercial about Mike J. Fox.  Michael Fox is playing a character in the first five episodes this year.  I just...  I mean, he...  It's a role...  It's a dramatic role that has comic elements to it.  And he's just...  It's a grand slam, man.  He's...  He's never done anything like this.  He was so unbelievable as this character.  And not just the stuff that we wrote.  He brought a lot of stuff to it.  He was improvising things.  It was...  It was exciting as hell. 
[01:42:00]  You know?  It really was.  You said you're gonna piss off America with this.  Who knows?  Because he's like America's sweetheart.  And now he's what?  Like a pill-popping?  Yeah.  And he's...  By the way, he's got another book coming out.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He's got a book about Hope coming out.  And you also said that he...  And he was writing it, by the way.  And he was writing it, supposedly, at the same time I was writing my book.  And I kept on...  You know, I kept...  I call him, because he's a...  He'd already written a book.  And I go, Mike, I don't know how to do this.  And I'm getting...  You know, you get frustrated.  I don't know if you had this thing, Jimmy.  I never wrote a book.  And I was like, geez, Mike, what do I do? 
[01:42:30]  And he's like, you gotta jump in, pal.  And you're either gonna love it or hate it.  But jump in and make yourself do it every day.  And duh.  So I was like...  I called him twice.  The second time, he gave me the big speech.  And I was like...  And I jumped in.  And for, like, during the writer's strike, for three months, I wrote every single day.  I loved it.  I loved it.  I loved it.  He's supposed to be writing his book on hope and optimism.  And I called him at the end.  And I was like, I'm done with my book, man.  I'm gonna send it to you.  And you send me yours.  He's like, I haven't finished my book yet.  And he actually told this story on set.  He said, you know, one day I walked into the house and said to my wife, this book on optimism 
[01:43:00]  is killing me.  And she was like, go downstairs and write.  So.  It's hard to be...  Sometimes...  Stories.  Sometimes it's hard to be like...  You want to write.  It's hard when you try to be funny because there's comics.  You know what I mean?  It's like sometimes you don't feel funny.  So you're like, I gotta write something funny.  And it's like, ugh.  Nothing comes out.  And then it's like three o'clock in the morning.  And all of a sudden, oh my God, that's a chapter idea.  And you just, all of a sudden, you start writing.  It's a weird way for me the process works. 
[01:43:30]  I mean, for everybody, it's different.  But I had to write every day, too.  Or I would just kind of lose interest in it.  Well, see, for me, it's easy, you know, I think, I don't know how you work, but as  a comedian, you know, like when I went up Saturday, you know, I've got four notes or  five notes on paper.  But because they're only kickoff points, that's like 40 minutes of material for me because  I talk it out on stage.  But, you know, like you said, sitting down, I can write an episode of Rescue Me or a movie  script.  And I know how to structure it and I know how much time it's going to take.  And it doesn't bum me out or depress me. 
[01:44:00]  And I might hit writer's block.  But I never get into a panicky thing, but a book, man, I was like, that's odd.  Yeah.  It's just, I write an episode.  Yeah, I know.  But it's because you're writing, you're trying to write in your comedian voice and you're  used to just sort of saying it out loud.  Yeah.  It's a weird process.  It's fun, though, because I like editing stuff that I've written because you can go over  it and go, ah, no.  It's like we're stand up where like once you said it, it's said you work it out again,  but in front of people.  But with a book, it's so much fun because you keep looking at it, going back and like the wording  is perfect and it's not right. 
[01:44:30]  It's a fun project to construct and deconstruct and put back together.  Yeah.  It's weird.  It's been more boring saying that, but he knows what I'm saying.  No.  That was Jim Norton, New York Times bestselling author.  Yeah, two authors just, you know, talking about the process.  This is called the fireside chat.  Sure.  You know what, Jim?  A couple of gentlemen.  No matter what else happens, you get on the New York Times bestseller list.  How cool is that?  Listen, they have to say for the rest of his life, New York Times bestselling author, Jim  Norton.  How great is that?  I actually make a girl say that while I'm banging her.  But you should.  That's like winning an Oscar or something, man. 
[01:45:00]  Oscar, when they put, like, there's a really crappy movie, but Oscar nominee, Nicolas Cage.  Right?  Oscar is going to be there.  It's always going to be attached to you.  That's true.  New York Times bestseller, Arrested with Transgendered Friend.  Yeah, exactly.  It's going to be the lead, right?  Even when you die, New York Times bestselling author, dead, you know?  With tranny.  Whatever.  Self-inflicted gunshot wound with a pile of his unsold books and his body.  His third non-bestselling book.  Whatever.  But they have to say that about you.  You guys were also talking about the sex thing that you're dealing with, Jimmy. 
[01:45:30]  And Dennis is like, holy crap.  Well, we were just talking about the process of writing and, like, how, for me, it was  weird because I was, you know, into porn and stuff.  I was so distracting, right?  I would literally have porn open and write.  Jesus.  It was very, I need distraction.  I can't just sit down in silence and write.  Okay, listen.  I've got ADD.  I talk about this in the book, too.  Because when I'm talking about this.  You've got ADD?  No.  Oh, ADD, HD, high def.  You know, I've got that.  Almost there's no I in there. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, but I mean, I don't, that one, like, I can, I had the radio on when I was working  and sometimes music and I had all kinds of reference books and I was Googling all the  time and stuff, but that's like, man, I don't even know how you do that.  I would actually, when I finally got down to editing and rewording, I was actually bringing  my laptop in here and then on break I would do it.  I need distractions because then there's no pressure.  Like, when I have a million distractions around me, it can't be like me and you having  a conversation.  It's just got to be background, that type of noise. 
[01:46:30]  But porn was a little too much.  Why don't you hire a guy that's standing in the corner and going.  Much better than porn play.  That's got to be a distraction.  I, honest to God, would stop and, you know, I would watch porn.  Now, are you, have you gone to like a sex rehab David Duchovny thing?  No rehab, no.  I mean, guys, I think, typically do that to save something like a relationship or a marriage.  I think normally that's like a, you know, that's like a rifle of the head move.  Or save sperm.  You know, he might want to.  Don't you run out of sperm at a certain point?  You'd be surprised, really.  One would think. 
[01:47:00]  Hey, you bring up Duchovny.  We feel like we might have pushed him over the edge.  Why?  He was in here.  He's a friend of the show.  He's been on a few times.  And it was describing the pal talk thing to him.  And it was filled with naked girls that day.  And next thing you know.  All right.  We're not sure if we might have been the last, the last straw for David.  Yeah.  We're showing him some girls.  In the middle of the interview, he's like showing him girls.  What do you mean?  Well, yeah.  Some of the girls on pal talk.  What's pal talk?  It's this live video feed conferencing thing.  See, they could see us. 
[01:47:30]  You could see them.  And a lot of times, they take their clothes off.  That's great, guys.  Did you know in advance that he had a...  No.  No.  Okay.  So you can't be faulted.  And he hasn't been on our show since, so we're wondering.  Well, that's because he's been in sex rehab.  Yeah.  We're wondering if maybe we pushed him over the edge.  We don't know for sure.  But the timing was pretty...  Well, maybe that's what they should do as a public service is when they find out that  they're celebrities or even just regular people, but mostly celebrities.  Yeah.  Because it's more fun.  Let's be honest.  If you find out that somebody's having that kind of a problem, you bring them in and you  do this pal talk thing. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  And if they go over the edge, you go right to rehab.  But you guys could get a deal advertising the rehab.  And we'll see.  Yeah.  We'll see if it puts them over the edge.  And then it's kind of like a litmus test.  And then you've done a public service.  Yes.  Yes.  You've saved their marriages.  They're helping.  And their sperm.  So, Dennis, what do you think?  He was...  And he's in that series where apparently...  Californication.  ...he's just having sex with different girls every week and stuff.  Maybe that wasn't the best thing for him.  Who knows?  Who knows is right.  I don't know. 
[01:48:30]  What do you think of Obama?  Well, I voted for Obama.  And I like the guy.  You know, I'm hoping...  There's a lot of issues that this guy talked about on his way up that, you know, that I  hope he stays true on.  A couple of...  I'm an issue-oriented guy as I get older.  Firefighters.  Federal funding for first responders.  Specifically guys in New York.  I just think it's ridiculous at this point that we don't have, you know, a huge federal  grant for New York City firefighters.  Because on 9-11, the first guys that responded were the New York City Fire Department. 
[01:49:00]  And the New York City Police...  Apparently you shut down firehouses and get rid of the...  So I just want...  More guys.  He said he would do...  John Kerry actually ran with that as part of his platform.  So anyways, Obama said he would do that.  He's talking about stem cell research, which I think is really important and I believe  in, and really some federal funding for that.  He's also mentioned that he federally wants to fund autism.  These are three points that I'd like to see him, you know, back up on.  But let's also be honest. 
[01:49:30]  I like the guy.  I think the guy's dynamic and everything else.  But could we give him a bigger crap pile?  I mean, literally.  It's like, okay, welcome, bro.  Happy to have a first-time black president.  There's no money.  There's...  Well, we got two wars.  And the auto industry is completely done.  Not a big issue, right?  Not a big issue.  And the gas is a, you know, it's actually lowering.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So it's just like, just pile it on.  Yeah.  Fix this. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  Fix this, bro.  And if he doesn't, there's not going to be another black president for a really long  time.  I mean, it's just, it's really, I mean, they're making it the biggest challenge that he could  possibly have.  But I love the guy.  I love his, I love the way he speaks.  I'm a little tired.  And I'm going to, you know, I've talked about this on Saturday.  I, you know, Lorenz Tate works on my show.  I got a lot of brothers working on my crew.  You know, it was a very exciting night at work because we were working during the election.  The next morning, everybody was hyped.  Lorenz Tate has not stopped talking about that.  I mean, every time you say something, he's like, yo, man, we got the White House. 
[01:50:30]  We're going to do this.  We're this.  We're going to do that.  Now this is going to happen.  And, you know, I want to just tell the brothers out there, okay, he got elected, not you.  Okay.  All right.  I know he said, yes, we can.  No, yes, he can.  All right.  He's moving into the White House, not you.  You know, settle down.  You know, we're all in this boat together and he's the president of all of us.  Earl's like that over on Ron Efez's show.  He just, he will not stop talking about Obama being elected and how this is great for us. 
[01:51:00]  And by us, he doesn't mean whitey.  No, right.  I think a lot of brothers think that they're going to start picking up white guys on the  street because our pants are pulled up too high and our baseball hats aren't cocked  sideways.  But that's not going to happen.  You know what I mean?  This guy is the president of all of us.  Thank God, by the way.  It's great to have an actual, intelligent, funny president again.  Did you guys see the 60 Minutes thing?  It was pretty good.  I love the way he talks.  I love how he thinks.  I love the fact that he spent five minutes complaining about the BCS thing. 
[01:51:30]  You know, the bowl championship series.  It was great.  He actually, he, he, yeah, he's obsessed with college football having a playoff.  I agree.  All sports fans have been yelling about this for years.  I can't stand it.  And here he is on 60 Minutes talking about, no, we need a playoff.  It's like, wow.  That's one of your issues.  We finally have a president who's smart, who's funny, who cares about sports.  Yep.  He's actually, I mean, I can't play basketball.  I'm a hockey player.  But he looks like a great athlete in the footage that I've seen.  Yeah, you can shoot the rock.  Yeah, so it's great to have.  But they won't let him have his BlackBerry or something? 
[01:52:00]  No.  He's not happy about that.  And his mother-in-law apparently is moving into the White House.  Did you hear that?  What?  I guess he has no control over that.  Oh, jeez.  You gotta love it.  That poor bastard.  That's good for us, though.  That means he's going to spend even more time in the office.  Yeah.  Just like trying to get stuff done to avoid that situation.  Oof.  So, Ant did not vote for Obama because, you know, I mean, everyone has their issues.  He's an antsy gun guy.  I'm a Second Amendment guy, and I don't like his position over his entire career about guns. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, it's too bad because now you have to turn those guns in and your tax money.  A lot of my taxes, that was another big issue.  Give us your tax money.  Tax money and my guns.  As a matter of fact, because I voted for Obama, you can actually give me your guns now and whatever money you have on you.  And I'll report back to Obama.  Yeah.  And tell him.  But all the Republicans, you gotta give it up.  Actually, just take the guns, turn them around, point them at me, and say, give me your money.  I'll gladly do that if you want.  That's pretty much where I feel I'm at.  Dennis, that's a big issue, the tax thing.  You do very well, obviously.  Does that bother you?  No, it doesn't bother me in the least.  Look it. 
[01:53:00]  You know what?  Why, though?  I'll tell you why.  Because Dennis makes a little bit more than $250,000 a year.  It's actually in my book.  My parents came from Ireland.  They came to this country.  Very shortly thereafter, an Irish guy became president.  My parents had been here for about eight years when Jack Kennedy was elected president.  So my old man and my mother raised us.  My father used to have a great saying, I think it's in the book, that he never judged anybody  by the color of their skin because there was plenty of a-holes even in our own family.  You know what I mean?  He got a lot of Irish need not apply when he first came to this country. 
[01:53:30]  And so he always took people on their face value, how they treated him.  And he was a lifelong Democrat, and he believed in helping the next guy get a leg up.  So to me, yeah, I've never even thought about, you know, yeah, I'm making more money and I've  got to pay more in taxes.  That's the way I look at it.  Like, I'm supposed to be, I don't know, I guess a roadie or a truck driver.  I mean, I'm not really supposed to be in the position I'm in.  And I got lucky, and in this country, I got to a certain point, I make a lot of money. 
[01:54:00]  I'm really pleased with this country.  So I don't mind giving money back.  And by the way, I don't understand, we just had eight years of a guy that basically said,  you know, I'm going to run it this way.  And, you know, less government, you know, there couldn't have been less government in  terms of Katrina, by the way.  The guy flew over in Air Force One and waved at people.  So I'm all for, let's go.  Now, because of what happened, we've got to go in.  And everybody's got to chip in, because otherwise, we're all screwed, you know?  We need, by the way, we need the Mexicans now, okay? 
[01:54:30]  I wish you guys would all stop complaining.  We need the Mexicans to come in in droves.  We need Canadians, you know?  If someone wants to come in and pick some lettuce, I got no qualms.  You know, it's fine by me.  I think you got to explain yourself, because you said that I feel exactly like...  I feel exactly the same.  Because people have heard you on the show.  Because I, I, the thing is, I do pay a lot of tax.  So, I don't like the idea of me being told I got to pay more.  That's what I don't like.  I already, when I... 
[01:55:00]  Well, who do you expect to pay the more taxes?  You know what, though?  The Mexicans that just came over the border?  I mean, you know, I, you know what?  The richer you get, the more taxes you should pay.  Make some cuts on this goddamn government that spends too much, and you'll find a lot of money.  Wait a minute, how are you going to do that?  But I spend, I pay so much in taxes.  So do I.  Yeah.  I pay a time.  I don't want to pay more.  Well, we're going to have to pay more, because we're starting from ground zero, basically, financially.  How about the multitudes in this country that don't pay taxes?  Well, listen, as far as I'm concerned, you know... 
[01:55:30]  How come it's got to rest on my goddamn back?  Every time it's got to rest on my back.  Well, I remember the speech where Obama actually mentioned you by name.  What are you talking about?  It does.  It does, it rests on my back.  The rich guys should be taking care of the poor guys.  No.  That's the way it's got to work.  Well, I totally disagree with you.  How are we going to fix it?  It's not capitalism.  We've got to give $25 billion to fix the American auto industry.  Take...  So they can make more crappy cars.  Listen, we've got to chip in.  It's not going to come from the poor people.  The Mexicans, they're coming over.  They don't have any money yet.  Take all these companies to task that are sending their executives out on these spa weekends. 
[01:56:00]  If you're going to bail out a company...  Well, I agree.  I totally agree.  If you're going to bail out a company, don't let them give bonuses to these bastards.  But those people should pay, and you and I should pay, and you should pay.  I do pay.  And Jim should pay.  I pay enough.  All right.  Well...  My quarterly taxes are well enough for one person in this country to contribute.  I'm a 50-50 partner with the United States government.  I'm going to get the black guys who work on Rescue Me and Lorenz, led by Lorenz Tate, to  call Obama, because apparently they all know him personally, and say that I want the Federal 
[01:56:30]  Funding for Firefighters and Autism and Stem Cell to come directly out of his contract.  Off Anthony's.  Off Anthony's.  Mr. Obama, could you please call Anthony and take more money out?  I'm Anthony the radio guy.  Yeah.  You're both right.  Joe the plumber, and Anthony...  Nice way to really come across and...  I think his silence means that he agrees with me.  I agree with both of you.  Like, helping other people is good, and it is positive, and you know what?  It does suck to be broke, but there is a resentment when the government continually 
[01:57:00]  sticks their hands in your pockets.  It's like there starts to be an anger because I don't respect the way they spend it.  Like, again...  Right.  Well, I totally agree with you on that.  If I felt I was getting away with something, if I felt like, whoa, am I paying nothing for  taxes, I would be like, you know, they finally caught up to me.  But I pay too much already for what they're spending.  And they tax every dollar you spend, and they tax everything you make in interest.  Meanwhile, we owe like $20 zillion to China.  I agree with that aspect of it, but if you're going to talk about, actually, you know, if 
[01:57:30]  you're going to talk about whatever, stem cell firemen, autism, whatever the subject might  be, I mean, we've got to get that money someplace.  Meanwhile, by the way, you know, we may not have no auto industry in about three years.  Oh, I know.  So, I mean, it's real bad.  We're in a bad situation here, man.  A lot of jobs are going to be lost because of that.  I know.  That's crazy.  How about we pull our military out of Korea and stop that stupid demilitarized zone, and  whatever Kim Jong-il wants to do, he does.  He wants to march in and take the South, let him.  It's none of our business.  Hey, by the way.  All that money.  You know, why doesn't that guy have his own reality show? 
[01:58:00]  He is one of the funniest guys.  He knows so little about him, but everything's just true.  I know.  And apparently, he just had his head opened up and his brain examined.  Come on with that on TV.  I love this guy.  Did you see Team America?  I did not.  Of course.  Oh, my God.  Of course.  Yeah, that's great.  One of the funniest movies ever made.  Apparently, they keep Photoshopping him now.  I know.  I know.  I saw the pictures.  I love him.  He's in public places.  Like, look, he's fine.  You're not there.  His legs don't match up with his shadows.  He's got to get a reality show.  Oh, yeah.  He's fantastic.  You've got to love that guy's outfit, his hair. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, the whole year is great on him.  He's fantastic.  He's just a short little fellow with dark glasses and a penchant for murder and pillaging  his own nation.  I love him.  We have to take a break, unfortunately.  We're going to wrap up in a few minutes.  You can stay or go.  I don't know.  Am I supposed to go, guys?  Yeah, okay.  I got to go.  All right, Dennis Leary, always a pleasure, man.  Why we suck a feel-good guy.  Dr. Dennis Leary on the cover.  Yeah, that's in my doctorate.  It's on one of the pages.  I copy.  Yeah, I copy. 
[01:59:00]  Doctorate.  And the signing, by the way, I have to correct because the paper was wrong.  It's not even Dumb Sam's fault.  It was on the list we got.  It's not 6.30 tonight.  It's 7.30.  This is where you get there after work.  You have time to get there.  It's 7.30 at Borders and Pen Closet tonight.  Who's signing?  Just you.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, my book.  Oh, my book.  Yes, your book.  Dennis is signing tonight.  But if you bring a copy of Jim Norton's book, I'll sign that, too.  So why don't you do this?  Why don't you buy my book, because you have to buy the book to get it signed, and buy Jim's  new book, and I'll sign that, too. 
[01:59:30]  That would be a double-header.  But it'll sign it over my face.  That's what you should do.  You should be passive-aggressive and go, I'm happy you got this, and then just sign  it right over your face.  And Dennis is also signing tomorrow in Staten Island.  It's at Barnes & Noble.  It's a great, great big store.  So even if it's raining, you're not going to be stuck outside.  Tomorrow night, 7 o'clock at Barnes & Noble in Staten Island.  And finally, because I care, Rescue Me, Season 5, in April, finally.  First week of April.  Awesome.  We're doing a giant benefit.  I do a thing called the Bash for New York's Bravest every year, and this year we changed 
[02:00:00]  it into a comedy bash, which will be, I think it's the 8th Annual Bash for New York's Bravest,  which benefits the Fire Department of New York.  And that will be, I forget the date now, but it's the Rescue Me premiere at Radio City Music  Hall.  Which we'll be invited to, I'm sure.  You'll be invited.  I'll be the debut episode, the premiere episode of the fifth season, and a live comedy show  with myself, Adam Ferrara, Lenny Clark.  It's the Rescue Me comedy tour, and then we're going on tour around the country with the comedy 
[02:00:30]  stars of Rescue Me.  Wow.  Awesome.  Yeah.  And my band, the Crown Royals.  Can I go to the premiere?  Yeah.  Of course you can.  Thank you.  Everyone says we can go, but then we never get the invite, so.  I'm going to make sure you guys get the invite.  All right.  I like to hear that.  Dennis Leary, always a pleasure, man.  Guys, thanks.  All right.  Quick break.  We'll finish up.  Opie and Anthony.  Heading to the finish line for today, Opie and Anthony.  Dennis Leary, always a pleasure, huh?  Yes.  Yeah.  Love that Rescue Me.  It's one of the shows I watch.  I don't watch many, but I watch that Rescue Me. 
[02:01:00]  It's a good egg.  The book's called Why We Suck, and it's in stores now, obviously, and he's going to sign  it tonight.  Our sheet was wrong.  It said 6.30.  It's 7.30 at the borders at Penn Station.  It's a great place for a signing, and again, a lot of indoor space, which counts, because  this way, even if the weather's bad, you're not going to get soaked or snowed up.  Right.  It's all good.  Yeah.  And he's doing, I think, Jon Stewart.  Are those fires out in L.A. or what?  Outside L.A.  They're still burning?  No.  It really depresses me when I see, you know, multi-million dollar mansions get burned to 
[02:01:30]  the ground.  Well, uh...  I get so sad.  One person that lost his house, very important.  Yeah, I know.  Apparently, Doc Brown's house is gone.  It's burnt down.  Christopher Lloyd, his $11 million house...  Wow.  ...has burnt down, and the worst part of the story that I read was him saying, I had just  started thinking about getting all of my memorabilia and stuff together and organized, and he said, 
[02:02:00]  I didn't do it.  Oh.  So he lost, and just to think of what memorabilia he must have had from, I don't know, a taxi.  What else has he been in?  Back to the future.  Back to the future.  That's it.  Oh, no.  Back to the future.  Oh, my God.  Imagine probably the original flux capacitor gone.  So, Anthony, why doesn't he go...  His mind-reading machine gone. 
[02:02:30]  Why doesn't he go back in time?  Because now he knows the fire's going to happen, and he gets a U-Haul truck.  Get that stuff out of there.  I'm sure the DeLorean burnt, too.  It was in his garage, which is just...  Oh, I got the memorabilia.  He had a hoverboard.  I'm sure of it.  Oh, look at that.  Doc Brown stuff.  All this happens in a matter of minutes.  It's just sort of sinking in. 
[02:03:00]  You watch TV, and you see these kinds of incidents happening here and there, but you look with a kind of detachment, because it's happening elsewhere.  Suddenly, to be in the midst of it, it's a very different awareness.  My memorabilia, which I kept delaying to go through and store, but I kind of don't have to worry about that now. 
[02:03:30]  It's amazing.  It's just gone.  Rebuilding would be...  You know, I just...  It's too much.  You know, I can't rebuild that.  What are you going to do?  That's so...  That's depressing.  Wow.  He doesn't sound the least bit happy.  That's a guy that lost everything right there.  He just hoped he had fire insurance.  I mean, because at least you could get your house rebuilt somewhere.  When these fires start, don't you think some of these homes, they get as much out as possible, just in case? 
[02:04:00]  You'd hope, but who knows?  I don't know how long they take to, like...  I know sometimes they're quick, and they just do their damage, but it seems like you do have time to, you know, maybe get some of the stuff out of your house.  This is terrible.  Uh-oh, what?  Someone's saying the last thing he said before the house went up is,  Michael, could you get me that candelabra?  Oh, jeez. 
[02:04:30]  Come on now.  The funny part is that somebody would need to be handed a candelabra.  Yes, a candelabra.  It's funny.  I have all my photos.  Well, I'd say 90% of them I have backed up.  Off-site?  No, well, they're on hard drives, but I want to actually put them in a bank vault. 
[02:05:00]  Not that they're so precious.  Where else do you put them that they won't get burned?  Yeah.  Watch the bank burn down.  Well, yeah, but it'll be in a metal case.  Banks are all metal.  I have nothing but feathers in my apartment.  It's all feathers and crushed up newspapers and candles.  Yeah.  It's a feather paradise.  It's a paradise of feathers and dust.  I like dust mites.  They're my pets.  So, uh, I want to actually put them in a bank vault just because, uh, if there's ever 
[02:05:30]  a fire, you'll never know, right?  At least your photos you have.  And my hats.  All your hats.  I have an XM hat and a Dodgers hat.  And a Yankees hat.  That was, that stupid Voss got Phil Rizzuto to sign.  And he signed, like, the green in dark pants.  You can only see it, like, hardly.  God, that's so, can Voss ever get anything right?  But I got to save it because it is Rizzuto.  Of course.  And he went bye-bye in the box.  Sure did.  You can see a signature with a black light or something. 
[02:06:00]  Exactly.  Wonderful.  Thanks, Voss.  God needed a shortstop and a boring money store commercial.  Yeah.  The money store.  Shut up.  Yeah.  The, uh, you got to watch that fire crap, man.  Wow.  That'll, because that destroys the stuff beyond any retrieval.  Oh, yeah.  Like, his memorabilia.  Just, just.  It's gone.  Maybe you can, uh, collect the ash.  Ashes.  And just.  And put it in glass cases.  That's what I would, I would do.  That's just as a, man.  Well, you got to make fun of it now.  Well, here's all my. 
[02:06:30]  Should I rebuild?  I don't think so.  It's just no rebuilding.  He had rare plants in his front yard, too, or something.  He collected rare plants.  Rare plants.  Why would you collect rare plants?  I know, there's, there's, there's a lot of things to collect.  Marty!  Marty, look!  It's a rare plant.  What?  You killed my pine!  You know what the thing is, though?  It was so, it was really depressing watching the footage of that, because it didn't look  like somebody's house burnt down.  Like, it, it looked like, like, nuke testing footage from the 40s.  Like, there was nothing left. 
[02:07:00]  Like, everything was just.  That's crazy.  Everything was gone.  Just the chimney.  The chimney survives.  So why don't you make the house look.  Shut up.  We get it.  Rare plants.  Dumb joke.  We got plants.  Let's get out of here.  Awful collection.  Yeah, right?  Would you like to see my collection of rare plants?  Rather not.  Right.  Can you show me the DeLorean again?  Please.  Exactly.  Show me the flux capacitor.  Yeah, please.  I'm going to make, like, a bean leaf.  With that, we're going to leave.  But we're going to continue.  Yes!  Over again. 
[02:07:30]  Don't you worry.  Have a good day.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Ah, we continue with the O.P. and Anthony Shoe.  And where, hey, what's up with my phone?  Hi.  Hello?  Hello?  Is this thing on?  Hi.  You know, can I complain about something?  Of course.  Oh, my God.  Who are we going to get mad at us now? 
[02:08:00]  We do.  Oh, my God.  No one.  God forbid you have a real moment on your radio show.  What's your name?  I want to know.  Yeah.  I do phoners after our show.  Yeah.  From that studio, and I keep a copy of I Hate Your Guts, because I like to reference it  and stuff, and it's gone.  And it's like, why do people have to touch other people's stuff?  Because it's a good read.  They want it, Jimmy.  Why is that?  Fair enough.  But it's not just that.  I know exactly what you mean. 
[02:08:30]  It's...  Why would you touch someone else's shit?  Yeah.  Shit that's just laying around.  It's like, let me take this.  No.  How about you don't take that?  That's what my friend Paul once said.  Let it be.  Right.  Let it be.  Let it be.  Oh, Uncle McCartney.  I whisper words of wisdom.  Let it be.  Let it be.  Just let it be. 
[02:09:00]  Now, now.  So people just stop touching, you know, in a place like this, it's just a bunch of pilfering  dick bags.  I don't like it.  You should put a turd in its place.  And go look.  No one knows the difference.  You took my book.  I got it.  But I think you wrote a fine novel.  Thank you.  Is it a novel officially?  Not really.  Novel's not fiction.  I know, I know.  You should leave a turd in its place.  And with a little note going, this is in place of the book you took that was mine. 
[02:09:30]  It's a duty.  So enjoy my duty.  That's right.  Instead.  By the way.  Yeah.  On the way home yesterday.  I had three cups of coffee.  Yeah.  And egg whites and a grapefruit.  Yeah.  And I was in the cab.  I started to feel gurgling as we were outside talking.  I was outside with Opie and Patrice chit-chatting.  Oh, no.  And my stomach went.  That's the worst.  It was a heavy shift.  It was like a physical shift.  Sure.  And I said, I better walk to the corner and hop in a taxi immediately. 
[02:10:00]  And I'm in the cab and the gas pain started.  I had to arch my cheeks off because I was going to shit my pants in the cab.  Wow, that's a bad one.  I almost jumped out.  It was a $3 fare.  I almost jumped out and handed him a $20 and walked into Bed Bath & Beyond.  Were you going to use one of the fake display toilets?  I would have shit on the escalator.  Anything but the street.  And I get home and I had to keep stop walking. 
[02:10:30]  I had to shit so badly I couldn't walk.  So you'd be walking and then you'd have to stop and clench your ass?  Breathe.  Heavy breathing and everything?  Like a pregnant woman trying not to push.  Dude.  I made it on the elevator.  And as I'm getting closer, I keep trying to distract myself.  I'm like, hey, you got to call Bob Eatman and you got to do all this stuff.  And just because my body knows I'm getting close to a toilet.  Yeah.  It knows. 
[02:11:00]  Your body knows when it's like getting close to a toilet.  Here's how bad.  I shit with my jacket on.  I love those.  Do you know how badly you have to shit when you leave your winter coat on and shit?  Where are your legs going while you're trying to pull your pants down?  Like, hold it in.  Dude.  I had to stop and just kind of stiff arm my trousers down.  And I plopped onto the toilet.  Stiff arm.  And it was fucking...  Do you ever have one of those shits that you're already shitting before your, like, ass hits the seat? 
[02:11:30]  Oh, it's like coming out.  It's literally coming out right after you pull your pants down?  It was one of those.  It left almost like a big...  It was almost like a mocha-colored mushroom.  No, there was no solid splash after.  Oh, good.  It was a mudslide, right?  Fucking awful.  God, why didn't we do Raisin Bran Monday?  You would have shit your pants, Jimmy.  You would have lost. 
[02:12:00]  Or maybe that's winning.  Who knows?  Yeah.  Yeah, we never figured out the rules to that.  What's winning and losing?  I think everyone loses.  I think we all win.  Yeah.  I think there'll be an obvious winner when we do Raisin Bran.  The Raisin Bran Challenge.  I don't want to do that.  Well, you know, it's funny.  I'll be in Las Vegas on Friday at the TBS Festival.  And I got a lot of requests for certain material. 
[02:12:30]  Mm-hmm.  And Bob Kelly and Rush Biddy will be on the show.  And I'm depressed because I'm competing with Seinfeld and fucking Ellen.  Who?  Never heard of them.  Never heard of them.  As long as it's not Jerry Seinfeld, you'll be all right.  Yeah.  No, it's not Ted Seinfeld.  Oh, you're all right.  You'll outsell Ted Seinfeld.  You'll outsell Ted Seinfeld.  Who are these people that have little haggers for their socks? 
[02:13:00]  I roll my socks up into balls and I throw them into the corner.  Sock haggers.  Who are these people?  Ted Seinfeld.  Wow.  That's right.  Hello, Jim Cramer.  Why are you screaming the N-word while quoting stock prices?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Hey, who's that cunt chef that ripped off my wife's book? 
[02:13:30]  Oh, yeah, okay.  My car doesn't work.  Hey, fat boy, push it.  See, that's, uh, it's Ted Seinfeld.  You don't have to worry about that.  Oh, no!  There's somebody telling you and handing me soup.  Oh, wait, wrong reference.  Fucking soup, Nazi. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  We get it.  You like a rush?  Yeah.  It's your thing, guy.  He didn't want to come on our show.  Why would he?  So now those things are closing all over the place.  Good.  All over the place they're going down.  Good.  Fucking 2,000 calories.  Take your soup and shove it up your keister, bub.  Wow, those were some delicious soups.  Oh, Jesus, weren't they?  The calorie count was off the charts, though.  Yeah, exactly.  How do you get 2,000 calories for a bowl of soup?  That's awful.  Soup Nazi.  That's a whole day of eating.  It's actually healthier to fuck Robert Reed while eating chocolate. 
[02:14:30]  Right.  And razor blades.  Yeah.  Yeah?  What?  He's just looking around.  Yeah, well.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Huh?  He wouldn't come on the show.  Al Yegeny or whatever his name was.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, because we were excited.  We were pushing his soup joints.  And we're like, yeah, let's get him on the show.  We'll have some fun with him.  We'll develop some kind of relationship. 
[02:15:00]  We could come in from time to time.  And it'll be a win-win for everybody.  He's like, nah.  Well, yeah, all right.  Now you're getting me.  Right.  What do you think your soup does to talking?  Shit face?  Yeah.  Right.  Take your soup and fucking...  And beat it.  Hit the bricks, sister.  Take a long walk off a short pier, pal.  Sure.  Hold your soup in your pockets.  Just get one of those takeout things full of piping hot soup.  And you open it up and splash it right into his face.  I love that.  Especially if it was cum soup. 
[02:15:30]  And it was mine.  Oh, it would be so great.  Exactly.  No eyelids for you.  Have some jism soup.  Mr. Snarky.  Mr. Cranky Pants.  Here you go.  Cream of Jim.  We could go creepy today.  Jonestown happened 30 years ago.  Oh.  That's not creepy.  It's hilarious.  Funny.  Dummies.  Have you heard any of this audio yet?  No.  Wow.  Where's Sam?  I want to hear the Aussie commercial too.  Do you really?  Yeah, I heard it's great. 
[02:16:00]  I think I threw that away.  No, it's right here.  Oh yeah, this thing?  What is he doing?  For Samsung phones?  Aussie and Samsung phones?  Yeah, they got him to pitch it.  I bet he'll Sharon.  Really?  Don't tell me anything.  I bet he is.  I don't know.  I haven't heard this either.  Blackheart have got a copy of me.  Excuse me?  Can I get a black copy?  Now he types it out.  Black coffee.  I have a coffee.  Ah.  Where to go?  50 more next place.  What?  We got a 50 more next place.  English. 
[02:16:30]  And then he texts.  Got it.  How does that make you feel?  What is it?  You bollocks.  What?  Something bollocks.  That's disturbing, Aussie.  That's the whole commercial.  See, you see, Aussie has to text.  Aussie has to text to people because they don't understand him.  It's annoying.  Because he's very.  But the thing is, I do understand him.  Like, when he says he wants a black coffee.  Yeah, yeah.  I got it.  He said black coffee.  Black coffee.  And then when something, had something make him feel he clearly says it's bollocks. 
[02:17:00]  Yes.  Like, I'm not having a problem understanding what Aussie's saying.  Maybe that means I'm fucked up or something.  Yeah.  Well, we know Aussie speak.  We've spoken to the man.  He rules.  What is that phone for?  What is the commercial for?  Samsung, I guess.  It's all about the Blackberry.  Why does anyone want to try with phones between the Blackberry, new one coming out, and the  iPhone?  Google phone.  And the Google.  Well, the what?  The Google.  The what?  How does Aussie know the guy's number? 
[02:17:30]  The Google phone.  The Google phone.  Yeah, there really is a terrible plot hole in that commercial.  How does Aussie know all these people's phone numbers?  I don't know.  Hey, yeah.  I've met him 30 times.  He doesn't remember my name.  You just want him to remember your name, too.  My face.  That's all.  You're the guy.  I've seen you.  That's right, though.  Blackberries.  iPhones.  But during the football games, they were promoting another phone.  Maybe someone knows which one.  Where the Bluetooth.  Here's a crazy concept.  The Bluetooth is actually connected to the phone. 
[02:18:00]  So, like, the Blackberry, the back of it?  All of a sudden, your Blueberry would be sitting in there.  Your Blueberry.  It's called a Blueberry, then.  Did I say that a few times?  The Bluetooth would be embedded in the actual phone.  Oh, I want to use my Bluetooth.  You pull it out, and it's not much thicker, by the way.  Use the Bluetooth.  Oh, you know what?  Time to charge the Bluetooth.  Boom.  Back into your phone.  Why couldn't they come up with that years ago?  Let me tell you something, though.  Once you have something that snaps onto your phone,  that then comes off, 
[02:18:30]  it will fucking get lost.  Guaranteed it will get lost.  Remember the little stylus that came with phones?  They were constantly getting lost.  Anything that clips on anything will unclip,  and you will lose it.  What if they have a replacement Bluetooth  that you can go to the store and buy?  Fuck that.  They're probably counting on people losing them.  Because by the time you lose it,  the phone will change,  the shape of the fucking Bluetooth thing will change,  and it'll be obsolete. 
[02:19:00]  What if the Bluetooth has a wire attached to it?  Then that's silly.  Then it's just a walkie-talkie.  It's a fucking tin can and string.  Eventually, we're just going to be walking around  with old-school phones,  because we realize,  ah, this is the best phone.  This is pretty much what I needed.  Why the fuck did we try to make this better?  I like the old people's phone that they sell  with the big red button for 9-1-1.  The jitterbug, yeah.  The jitterbug.  What?  I use my jitterbug.  I didn't hear about this.  Oh, these are great.  They have bigger buttons, 
[02:19:30]  so I can see it more clearly.  And I don't need those pesky things like cameras.  I just want a phone.  And that's pretty much what it is.  It's just a phone  with big old people fucking numbers on them and shit.  Looks like someone listens to the O.P. and Anthony show.  We said make it simple for the old codgers.  There's a market for just simplifying  all this technology for old people,  like the DVD player we've talked about.  Most old people cannot figure out  how to work a DVD player.  There it is. 
[02:20:00]  I never heard of this thing.  And it flips close,  so they're not calling everybody  every two seconds by sitting on the numbers.  Right.  Hello?  Yes?  No, they don't even say hello.  They're just sitting there going,  ah, I haven't been able to shit in a week.  I think this is the one  that you were really talking about.  Yeah, that's the real bad one.  This is for, like, super oblivious old people.  It's operator is the top one.  My choice, which I guess is like  my son David who bought my life call pendant, 
[02:20:30]  and 911.  Oh, my God.  That's all that offers.  And then there's a yes and no button.  Getting old sucks.  That's what you get.  On the other one,  where there actually is numbers and stuff,  like, they don't even have to know  how to put people's numbers into their phones  because there's, like, a centralized,  like a security service  that they just call them,  and they say,  I want to put my son Frank in my phone,  and they'll do it there,  and then beam the contact to the phone,  so they don't have to do anything.  Look at this fucking little misconception here. 
[02:21:00]  Notice the number that came up  when she, it's mom.  Right.  How old is the mother that she's fucking calling?  Because that's the outgoing call, is mom.  That's the selling point.  You can get reception in a casket.  Another thing about this phone,  is if you notice, it's $150.  Yeah.  The iPhone is $300.  There's no contract, Travis.  Oh.  Oh, there's no contract.  Of course there's not.  By the hour.  And be dead by the hour.  How do you call all the people at that? 
[02:21:30]  I don't see, like, numbers.  You hit my choice.  And then what happens?  You probably get one number  that you're able to choose from,  and that's it.  But what if you want to call someone else?  You're fucked.  Then you've got to call the operator.  And say,  Hello, operator.  Could you please connect me?  And they go,  Excuse me, it's 2008.  What the fuck are you talking about?  The operators must be thrilled  that they're sending more people.  Yeah.  Is there a wire?  There's a way.  How great would you be to get?  Where's the antenna?  To get some of those call center phone calls 
[02:22:00]  that you know that they're getting.  Oh, dude, how great.  That would rule.  Who is this?  Who is this, please?  I didn't call you.  Tim H. from Columbus.  I hit the My Choice button.  And it's supposed to be my son.  They're calling the cops.  They're going to hit their daughter.  Yeah.  What is that?  9-1-1.  Tim H. from Columbus writes,  My mom has a jitterbug.  The fucking thing even has a dial tone. 
[02:22:30]  Does it?  So they feel very comfortable.  I'm like,  Oh, okay.  This is sort of like my,  what I know.  It's like a real phone,  only for stupid people.  You fucking burdens.  And they got to call it a name  that the old folks will be happy with.  Yeah, yeah.  The jitterbug.  That's funny.  Oh, that's good.  How about the stroke?  Hey, look.  It's the brand new,  it's the Samsung pants shitter. 
[02:23:00]  I want to buy my mom  the new phone called  The Burden.  I like my brand new  no s***s aloud.  Reminds me of the old days.  Yes.  The pants shitter.  Yes.  Look,  look mom,  AT&T has a new phone.  It's the diaper.  There's 911  and then there's  the store  so they can bring you pampers  if you've made a cocky.  Look, 
[02:23:30]  you can dial two numbers,  your son  or the funeral parlor.  It's like,  they think,  look mom,  it's for their cab  and meanwhile it's a hearse.  Show me.  You program it into the fucking  funeral parlor  as a little joke.  Yeah.  Oh, it's my choice.  This is my son.  Hello,  I'm so sorry.  You've reached the funeral parlor. 
[02:24:00]  One of the buttons  is just a face  with the X'd out eyes.  That's so lame.  You can't tell  all the other numbers.  The jitterbug.  Scoodle you do.  Yes.  Yeah,  the jitterbug  so they can remember  when they used the jitterbug.  It's probably because  they always shake  so they're calling it that.  The jitterbug.  Yes,  oh look,  it's the new Verizon Parkinson's.  Big numbers  so your dumb moving head  can fucking,  can somehow grab them  as it's passing by. 
[02:24:30]  Fucking old Jupiter head  won't stop moving.  Hey,  pulsar skull.  Fucking,  with your big thinning  cotton candy hair.  Oh shit.  Oh,  what a burden.  That pink scalp  showing through.  Every veins pulse  you can see.  Thomas Overbeck  from Dallas.  The new Nokia  knocked my hat off.  Oh,  excuse me young man.  I'm going to use  my jitterbug. 
[02:25:00]  Oh,  I like the new,  it's the new phone,  it's the Dirt Nap  by Sprint.  It's funny,  comes with a satin pillow.  Yeah,  you open the box,  it's sitting on a satin pillow  in a little casket.  And there's like  a one page  instruction manual.  Open phone,  talk.  Die.  Yeah,  die.  You can't even close it,  you open it once,  you talk and you drop dead.  Fucking.  It's the ringtone. 
[02:25:30]  The Sprint  Dirt Nap.  To the Dirt Nap.  Oh,  a call's coming in.  Call friend  and living family member.  Next of kin.  Next of kin button.  The calling plan  has two people on it.  Your son  and God.  I love it.  Top Gun from Canada writes, 
[02:26:00]  the eye  had an accident.  The new phone,  yes.  Let's say hi to Rick  in Westchester.  Rick.  Hey boys.  Hey.  What's up,  Rick?  Panasonic's got a new phone  called the Palsy,  the Panasonic Palsy.  Panasonic Palsy.  He said Palsy.  Yes.  Palsy.  Palsy.  Sarge,  whack bag,  what's up,  sir?  Yeah,  they should have the  I drove through  the crowded restaurant.  All people tend to do that. 
[02:26:30]  Here I do.  We can do a bunch of  I references now.  My gas pedal's stuck.  Oh look,  it's the Samsung  broken hip.  Let me have the  broken hip.  Like every time  you close the phone  it shatters.  A brittle phone case.  Or it's for lonely  old people  so it reminds you  of your family.  Every time you  pick it up  it just goes,  shut up,  be quiet,  go in your room.  So you feel like  you're home. 
[02:27:00]  Go to your room.  Stop interfering.  Burn,  you stink.  Change your diapers.  You smell poorly.  There's piss  on the back  of your dress.  Take off that  house coat.  You've been wearing  it for a month.  Four of your pets  are dead.  Have them removed.  They're not sleeping,  you fucking idiot.  Stupid old people  and their poodles.  Yeah,  when did you  lose your way  and think  a stiff cat  was comfortable?  How far gone 
[02:27:30]  are you?  Jitterbug.  Where's Marge?  Marge died  in 1978,  you forgetful  fucking mollusk.  She's trying to  call her on her  jitterbug.  Where's Marge?  Where you should be.  For one of your  relatives with Alzheimer's,  imagine the horror  and shock they go  through every time  they look at that  fraud like,  what is this?  What is it?  I don't understand.  Who is this?  It's the sprint  all new to me.  It's just a question 
[02:28:00]  mark on the three  buttons.  No idea.  It's a slot machine  you grab off.  Call someone  just like a one-armed  name.  Just roll around  and stop.  Good luck to you.  Oh,  that's funny  question marks.  Deliver us  from evil.  It says,  the Nokia,  have you seen  my teeth?  Hey,  Troy in Cleveland, 
[02:28:30]  how are you,  Troy?  Doing pretty good,  guys.  How are you?  Pretty good today.  The LG Depends.  The LG Depends?  Yeah.  Nice.  Yes.  Nice.  Safe to say  everyone's got  their own name  for this phone  coming in now.  I don't know.  Mike,  I had a better one,  but I think it should  be the pattern  of the thing.  You know how you  get different skins  for your phone?  It should be one  with just liver spots  all over it.  Nasty liver spots. 
[02:29:00]  What color is your phone?  It's jaundice.  Piss yellow.  Oh,  poor old people.  Poor old people.  Phone has a charm  bracelet on it.  Ask me about  my grandchildren.  No.  Supposedly,  I was talking  to a teacher yesterday.  There's a phone  where it rings  in such a way  that adults can't hear  and anyone else  hearing about  this new technology.  They figured out 
[02:29:30]  some kind of tone  that younger ears...  You've heard of this?  Well,  yeah,  they've used it.  Is this real?  Yeah,  it's a very high-pitched tone  and apparently  you could hear it  better as a kid.  So,  I remember reading  a story about  some drugstore owner  couldn't get kids  to stop hanging out  in front of his place  so he put  a loudspeaker up  and it was just  blasting this tone  because only kids  under 15 or 16  could hear it.  Come on,  really?  Yeah,  and it would keep them  with their heads  like a dog.  It's like a real  high-pitched,  squeaky tone.  Huh. 
[02:30:00]  Well,  this old people's phone  has a special feature  where it changes  the caller ID  so no one knows  it's you  and they actually answer  before they realize  it's you.  Oh,  good,  it's pop-pop.  Oh,  shit.  Yeah,  it's like work.  You're looking,  oh,  I gotta take this call.  Hi,  I fooled you!  Yeah,  it's the Verizon,  it's me again.  That disguise  a burden.  Let's go to Matt  and log out.  Tired of always  getting the answering  machine? 
[02:30:30]  Tired of always  being rushed  off the phone?  What do you got,  Matt?  Yeah,  they have the  all your family  and friends  are dead plan.  Oh.  Very good.  Dan in New Orleans  actually has a good one.  We're gonna move on  but hell no.  Dan?  Yeah,  yeah,  the new,  the new black,  the new black  bury me phone.  The ringtone  is a flat line. 
[02:31:00]  Black bury me.  No,  when someone's  calling you  the ringtone  is,  Mom,  are you okay?  Mom,  are you okay?  She cares.  All right.  30 years ago,  what?  We'll do this  after the break?  30 years ago,  let's see.  We got the  Jonestown death  tapes.  That was 30 years?  Yeah.  What happened there?  And the tapes  are really creepy,  huh?  Yeah,  they are.  I hear there  were a couple  of injuries.  In Jonestown? 
[02:31:30]  Yes,  a couple of  bathers were  attacked and  there were  a couple of  injuries.  Fucking mayor  knows how to  downplay a  fucking shark  biting some  woman in half.  Did you do  that for our  benefit or  that's how you  eat bananas  every single  time,  Jimmy?  No,  I just dipped  it into  a fucking  yogurt.  Jimmy's dipping  a banana in  white yogurt.  So it's all  sloppy and  then he shoves  the banana with  a creamy  fucking sauce on it.  I really thought  you were doing  that for us,  but no,  that's how you  eat bananas.  I don't care how  hard your dicks  get.  I mean,  enjoy them.

What happened?  He found out his chick  was cheating.  Oh, boy.  And he went out and  shot the bitch.  Did he?  Yeah.  I love Tom Jones, man.  I really do.  He's a fucking animal. 
[02:38:30]  He'll be on the show  soon.  He's a British animal.  Why don't we play  Dry, Dry Vagina?  I mean, come on.  The big hit from  Brother Joe.  What's wrong with us?  Jesus.  You got that.  One moment, please.  I'm trying to quietly  eat my apple, but it's  very hard.  Can I have a bite of  that apple, Jimmy?  Ugh, no.  Please, the other  side.  No.  Please?  Mm-mm.  Can I see it?  Jimmy, can I see your  apple?  What are you going to  do with this?  I just want to see it.  No, you don't.  Yeah.  I'm enjoying what 
[02:39:00]  happened.  Can I just see it?  I hate a mealy apple.  I hate a mealy apple.  Is there anything better  than biting into an apple  and then you have to  bite into the bruise  that you didn't know  was there?  Mealy.  Oh, is that the word?  Oh, God.  A bruise.  It's bruised.  Your apple has the AIDS.  Exactly.  Ugh.  Biting to Vicky LaMotta.  Leave it to my mom.  She found a place that  sold bruised apples  at a discount.  Bruised apples, 
[02:39:30]  cracked eggs.  So every apple  had a bruise on it.  That's dry fish.  Here's dry, dry vagina.  Same song.  All right.  Dry, dry, dry vagina.  Dry, dry, dry vagina.  So before my penis starts to get sore, 
[02:40:00]  go pick up some dazzy lube at your local drugstore.  Said, go get some dazzy lube at your local drugstore.  Oh, you stink, baby.  By the way, we played that on regular radio.  Yeah, yeah.  You can't play that on regular radio anymore? 
[02:40:30]  Just to play that on regular radio.  Sure.  Oh, fuck, did that happen?  All right, Jonestown Death Tapes.  30 years ago today.  It was 30 years...  So what do we got there, Sam?  Well, Jim Jones...  What did you do?  What's the haps down in Jonestown?  No, there's no one there anymore.  Yeah.  But, uh...  Really?  Yeah.  I thought maybe one would be kind of hanging around there.  Yeah.  No.  Seeing what's going on. 
[02:41:00]  Well, Jim Jones used to pump everything through a PA system.  Yeah.  So these are the last tapes.  When he was trying to convince...  Kill everybody?  Yeah, this is him convincing everybody to kill themselves.  How did they tape it?  I have no idea.  I wasn't there to tape.  I'm just here to collect the...  Oh, okay.  If it went out over PA, did he record it first and then just play it?  No, no, no.  He was just live.  He said it and did somebody have a giant tape recorder from back then?  Reel to reel or something.  Yeah, record it.  Yeah.  Because, you know, you can't just hold up your cell phone. 
[02:41:30]  No.  Can't hold up that jitterbug.  No, they didn't have him back then.  No.  So he's broadcasting all these tapes to his followers?  No, yeah, but this is like live.  He's got a mic in front of all his followers.  Holy shit.  So the first one is Jim Jones justifies killing the congressman and the members of his church  that were leaving.  Right, because this was like what led up to...  Oh, stupid people wanting to leave.  Yeah, they wanted to leave.  But he said they could leave.  And then as they were getting on the plane to leave... 
[02:42:00]  Oh, yeah.  The truck came and blasted them all.  Just shot them all.  And so then he said, before anybody else comes here, we have to all kill ourselves because  they're going to make us look like villains.  Now I put us all in Dutch.  Right.  So time to kill yourself.  To sit here and wait for the catastrophe that's going to happen on that airplane, it's going  to be a catastrophe.  Almost happened here.  Almost happened.  The congressman is nearly killed here.  But you can't steal people's children.  You can't take off with people's children without expecting a violent reaction. 
[02:42:30]  And that's not so unfamiliar to us either, even if we were Judeo-Christian.  If we weren't communists, the world, the kingdom, suffers violence, and the violence  shall take it by force.  If we can't live in peace, then let's die in peace.  Right.  What the fuck?  Wow, he's killing.  Literally. 
[02:43:00]  Hey, uh...  Wow.  I don't understand how guys get a following like this.  I don't know.  I want to figure that out, though.  That'd be cool.  That'd be your next thing?  Yeah.  You could probably pull it off.  Meh.  Well, you convince all those people to move down to South Africa or whatever.  You could probably convince them to kill themselves.  Probably.  Yeah.  They're cheering death, knowing they're going to die.  Yeah.  Wow.  But it's because their, you know, lord there told them.  Does he lispers at the tape? 
[02:43:30]  That's an awful lisp.  No, that's him.  If anybody's listening to a guy who speaks like this...  You think he'll listen like this?  Who the fuck would go this time and kill ourselves?  Suffering fuck-attached.  Trying to kill ourselves.  I don't want to drink the Kool-Aid.  Man, I mean, we all like to follow bands and stuff, but your favorite band, like,  gets you to a point where we're all going to just kill ourselves now.  When do you tap out and go, you know what, fuck you, fuck your music, fuck your shirts  and all your merchandise?  Just before. 
[02:44:00]  You just watch everybody else drink the Kool-Aid and then at least you got the story.  Yeah.  You gotta leave one guy around to tell the story.  Well, this is delightful.  Jim Jones tells his followers there's no way to survive.  Yes.  Oh, wonderful.  And I bet you they cheer this.  Do they cheer this?  They know, to them, it's the word of God coming down pretty much.  Of course it is.  With the guy that has a lisp.  Yes, God has a lisp.  Lisping God.  Lisping God.  My opinion is that we'll be kind to children and be kind to seniors and take the portion 
[02:44:30]  like they used to take in ancient Greece and step over quietly because we are not committing  suicide.  It's a revolutionary act.  We can't go back.  They won't leave us alone.  They're now going back to tell more lies, which means more congressmen.  And there's no way, no way we can survive.  Hmm.  Yeah, he's gearing them up here, boy.  He's telling them to help the kids and the elderly kill themselves first. 
[02:45:00]  Well, that's very cordial.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is this from a news crew?  Someone's saying there was a news crew with a senator when the whole death thing went down  fast, right?  Yeah, but...  That's where the recordings are from.  Not this recording, because when he was trying to leave, that's the news crew and the senator  trying to leave.  Right.  They got all shot up.  They killed the news crew?  As far as they know.  It wasn't all bad.  It wasn't.  Jim Jones asked for medication for the children and the elderly.  Aw, that's nice. 
[02:45:30]  Please get it to me.  He's got a headache.  Give him an anvil.  He's not feeling too well.  Do you have a noose?  I have a lip.  I talk like the mayor from Carter Country.  Carter Country.  Holy shit.  Chief Roy Moby.  Handle it, Roy.  Handle it.  Wow.  I am surprised you remember that.  Please get us the medication.  It's simple.  It's simple.  There's no convulsions with it.  It's just simple.  Just please get it. 
[02:46:00]  Before it's too late, the GDF will be here.  I tell you, get moving.  Get moving.  Get moving.  Don't be afraid to die.  If these people land out here, they'll torture some of our children here.  They'll torture our people.  They'll torture our seniors.  We cannot have this.  Patty Parks is dead.  The congressman's dead.  The congressman's dead.  Many of our traitors are dead.  They're all laying out they're dead.  I didn't, but my people did. 
[02:46:30]  My people did.  I don't want to take it.  My traitors.  Yeah, he's saying that all the people that he just said, you're free to go, he's announcing  to everybody, those guys are all dead.  Yeah, yeah.  And so you all have to kill yourselves or people are going to come here and torture you.  Yeah, because you're free to go too.  Just like they were.  Or kill yourself.  Yeah.  Fucking asshole.  This guy had quite a few people too.  900 and something.  Yeah.  Did any of them survive? 
[02:47:00]  We got one survivor story.  Well, and on a happy note, Jimmy.  Yeah.  That's what we do today.  We're trying to.  Dummy.  Jim Jones tries to calm down the children who are dying.  Yes.  We got audio of this?  Yeah.  I mean, there are a lot of kids crying because they would rather not be deceased.  Not die.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I can understand.  Shit.  Oh, my God.  You gotta be kidding me, man.  If you're crying, you're dying.  What the fuck? 
[02:47:30]  This is the solution I want for airplanes.  Fucking little bastards.  Oh, the parents deserve it, you dummies.  He said that I was watching a documentary before this even happened, like before they  even moved, when they were in San Francisco, he had everyone drink Kool-Aid and then he  told them all there was cyanide in it just to see who was loyal to him.  Oh.  Like to watch, to see who panicked and who went with him.  What happened?  Did a lot of people panic?  Yeah, some people panicked.  They were like, what? 
[02:48:00]  But some people stayed with him through that, moved to Jonestown with him, and then actually  killed themselves.  And then fell for the Kool-Aid thing again.  Yeah.  They were probably like, no, it's really not cyanide.  He pulls this gag all the time.  Yeah.  Oh, come on.  He does this all the time.  It's not really cyanide, right?  It's just something to put you to rest.  Oh, God.  Mother, mother, mother, mother, mother, please.  Mother, mother.  Mother, please. 
[02:48:30]  Please.  Please.  Don't.  Don't do this.  Don't do this.  Stay down your life with your child.  But don't do this.  Don't do this to you.  Free at last.  All right.  The kids are dead.  Keep your emotions down.  Keep your emotions down.  Children, it will not hurt if you'll be quiet.  If you'll be quiet.  Yeah.  No.  Oh, this is really creepy.  The kid's like, no. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  Ah, no.  Like they're.  Yes.  Because they were all communists.  So they were like, we can go to Russia.  Like there are people who said, no, I think we can go to Russia.  We don't have to do this.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Mother, mother, mother, mother.  No, no.  That won't work.  That's a bad plan.  Oh, my God.  Plan stinks.  No.  No.  She said Russia?  Yeah.  She said we can go to Russia.  I don't think we have to.  And he said, no, no.  He goes, yes, yes.  Russia right to the Kool-Aid and start drinking it, dummy. 
[02:49:30]  But he, I mean, because he died of a gunshot wound.  Yes.  And nobody knows if he shot himself.  Because there were obviously people with guns there because somebody shot the congressman  and all the people were trying to escape.  So.  Some of his most loyal followers had the guns.  If you didn't drink the Kool-Aid, they probably would have just shot you.  Yes.  Yeah, they would have.  Yeah.  They were definitely all around there.  He didn't die with Kool-Aid, though?  No, he got shot.  I think it was self-inflicted.  You really do?  Yeah.  There's the picture. 
[02:50:00]  Wow.  That's good.  Bodies everywhere.  I like the, when they, they had a flyover and they thought it was a picnic.  Yeah.  People thought it was a fucking picnic.  Oh, really?  Yeah, because it's like, when you see that from the sky, you just think, oh, look, colorful  blankets are out and people are picnicking.  You don't think, oh, there's a bunch of dead people.  900.  900 dead folk.  Oh, wow.  They're setting up for Woodstock.  Yeah, this is cool.  Cool, man.  Little babies down there laying on the blankets.  Look at that.  They're bringing back Woodstock.  I'll just lay in there dead.  I want to see the hoop. 
[02:50:30]  That must have stunk so badly.  Jim Jones says death is something to look forward to.  All righty.  I'll tell you, I don't care how many screams you hear.  I don't care how many anguished cries.  Death is a million times preferable to 10 more days of this life.  If you knew what was ahead of you, if you knew what was ahead of you, you'd be glad to  be stepping over tonight.  If you'll quit telling them they're dying.  If you adults will stop some of this nonsense.  Adults.  Adults.  Adults.  I call on you to stop this nonsense. 
[02:51:00]  I call on you to quit exciting your children when all they're doing is going to quiet rest.  I call on you to stop this now if you have any respect at all.  I really hate this guy.  This guy is the worst.  He's a dickhead.  Wow.  Dickhead.  Very good.  So what?  The adults now are going, holy shit, I can't sit here and watch my kid die.  It's like, oh, you're dying.  You're dying.  I don't give a shit what this means.  I can't do this.  And he's saying, stop this nonsense.  Tell your kid that they're just resting. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, they're just resting.  Don't tell them that they're dying.  Drink this delicious cyanide coolie.  Yeah.  Join them.  Someone really mad.  Joe in Ohio.  Yes, Joe.  Hey, man.  I love this show.  Don't get me wrong.  You guys are great.  You make me laugh.  Oh, boy.  That means there's a problem.  Why don't you just get to the problem?  That's okay.  I don't give a shit.  People have to preface it.  I like, but just, what's your problem?  Okay, OB.  Cut to the chase.  The problem is you're playing audio of kids dying.  Is that fucked up?  Don't you think that's fucked up?  We're playing news footage, dude, of an event that happened that really brought cults into 
[02:52:00]  light and what cults do.  It's a very famous event that happened.  30 years ago.  It's almost like playing 9-11 audio or something like that.  So what's the issue?  That's too soon.  What's the issue with us playing the audio?  What's the issue with the 9-11 audio?  What's that?  You're not hearing people dying.  Yes, you are.  You're just not hearing it as graphically.  They scream and die.  No, you hear a plane crash into a building and people on the street go, oh my god.  Like I said.  You're hearing kids in the background. 
[02:52:30]  No, you're hearing it.  Yes, you are.  But you're hearing kids crying.  They're fucking dying.  They're not dead.  Yes, you are.  The dead ones are quiet.  You don't like it?  Don't listen.  It's real news footage.  It's audio that exists.  It happened.  It's a very famous mass killing.  I know.  You don't like it?  You're exploiting it and you're making fun of it.  Yep.  What do you think that's...  Making fun of it.  I'm not really making fun.  I was making fun of it because...  I'm kind of deeply disturbed by the whole thing.  I hate this guy.  It's thinning the herd.  I think these fucking people that went there and followed this jackass all deserve to be 
[02:53:00]  laying there with their stupid kids and being dead.  Good.  Good.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Fuck them all.  Good.  They're dead.  Fuck them.  Fuck them.  Fuck them.  Fuck them in their dead asses.  Can I agree with you that the adults that follow this ass deserve to die?  Oh, you think the kids would have been any better?  Please.  Well, to be honest, they're innocent, though.  They're too young to really know.  Ah, screw it.  They belong to the parents.  Fuck them.  They're property to do what they want with.  I could give a shit.  I will say off the subject, that one lady has a very nice hiney. 
[02:53:30]  Little supple dead ass right there.  That's before rigor set in.  It's funny.  Did you call all the magazines like Life and Time and scold them for publishing the photos?  Yeah, on the cover of Time.  No, because I'm only 25.  I wasn't alive when this actually happened.  All right, so why don't you call them now?  It's still all over the place.  I've never heard the audio.  So why are you listening if you don't like it?  I've never heard the audio either.  Instead of being a self-righteous, angry young man, why don't you just...  I'm not self-righteous.  Yes, you are.  I am self-righteous?  Yes, of course you are. 
[02:54:00]  So you just said it.  You're playing audio of kids.  We know what it is, stupid.  Who cares?  It's a real event.  It's 30 years ago.  There's kids right now, this second, that are starving somewhere.  Go help them.  Yeah, should we not ever show African footage on the news of people starving?  Or should we...  And you say 9-11 audio is different.  No, it's not.  You're still watching people die.  You're just not seeing it as close.  I suppose, in a sense, that's correct. 
[02:54:30]  You don't like it?  They're not dying at the moment.  Thank you for agreeing.  You don't like it?  It's not the moment of their death.  Yes, we are seeing the moment of their death.  It was the moment before their death.  And we're hearing a maniac.  I've never heard this stuff before.  And it's fascinating.  It's morbid and it's fascinating.  No, I agree.  It's amazing that this happened.  It's amazing that there's footage of it happening.  The bottom line is, we're hearing something awful that is a real event that happened.  And we absolutely are going to play it. 
[02:55:00]  And if you don't like it, you don't have to listen to it.  But to call up and express indignation is childish.  Just don't listen.  Be an adult.  Go, you know, I don't like this.  It's not for me.  I'm not going to listen.  That's all you have to do.  The show's not for everybody all the time.  At every moment.  Right.  There's going to be times you're like, you know what?  I'm not into that.  I'm going somewhere else for a while.  If I don't like something, we keep you interested enough where it's a popular channel and we  continue doing our show.  If I don't like something, that's what we hope for.  I just don't listen to it or don't watch it.  I've never called CBS or HBO or any channel and said, I don't like something. 
[02:55:30]  I just don't watch it.  I did once.  Lucky Louie.  I called up HBO.  As far as you got through, the phones weren't busy.  I'm a bit disturbed listening to this audio.  I'm not going to lie to you.  But like Jimmy said, it's fascinating.  I think that's what my issue is, too.  And I've never heard this guy talk before, I don't think.  Or if I have, it's been many, many years.  And it's, wow.  That sounds silly.  You start thinking all sorts of shit. 
[02:56:00]  Like, what would it take for people to really believe in a guy like this all the way to  the end like this?  He had everyone fooled.  The night before, when the congressman was there, he went to like a big party they were  having.  I don't understand the congressman's story.  That guy was going there to broker a deal maybe to end this fucking thing?  The ones who wanted to leave could leave.  He went there to see, because there was a lot of controversy around it, and nobody knew  what it was.  So he went there to see what it was.  And like the night before, they had this party, and everybody's celebrating, and he's  like, you know, you guys are all happy here.  I can't believe how, what a great time you're having.  Yeah, this looks great. 
[02:56:30]  And then people started slipping him notes.  Yeah.  Saying, I want to leave.  Ah, help.  I want to leave.  They won't let me leave.  They won't.  And so then he said.  He was able to brainwash these guys to that point.  Because weren't they in the middle of nowhere?  Couldn't they just like, I would have just taken a fucking chance.  That made it even worse.  They were in the middle of the jungle.  Since I see the first guy dying, I'm like, I'm taking a chance.  I don't give a shit.  In the middle of the jungle.  He's telling people who wanted to, oh, the ones who wanted to leave were shot.  Right.  Okay.  So what about at night?  There was only one way out in the airfield.  Where are you going?  These people weren't like set up to go on safari. 
[02:57:00]  I understand that.  They had nothing but the shirts on their back.  And for the best.  And there had to be guards.  If there's people there to shoot you, if you leave, there's got to be guards.  But then the guards have got to say, wow, this isn't going to be good for me in the end.  Guards always have it better.  I'm going to jump back to what Ann said, though, about what it takes for people to follow this shit and actually go through it.  I did.  Yes.  I'm sorry.  Who said that?  That was Mark.  Jimmy.  Oh, whoever it was.  My point is, though, that the adults, you're right, they've followed this and believed it.  The kids didn't have a choice. 
[02:57:30]  And you're right.  They belong to the ignorant adults.  Fair enough.  But still, give them time to grow up and have them have a conscious and decide for themselves.  You know, is that still wrong?  Yes.  It is wrong?  It's not what history had in store for these people.  You're missing the point, sir.  They were being punished for their naughtiness.  You can't take all this back.  But still, it's kind of fucked up that we're sitting here listening to this.  And don't get me wrong.  You guys are funny.  But you're cracking jokes about these kids.  No, we're not.  We're making fun of the guys.  A, if I wanted to make a joke about the kids, I would. 
[02:58:00]  But we didn't.  We were making fun of the guys to lisp.  I made a crying airplane baby joke.  Oh, that was funny.  Gee, I'm sorry.  Oh, wow.  Look at me.  That's not too bad.  And this is what...  Behind a kid on a plane?  Of course you want to fucking slip or something.  It's not about a kid on a plane.  Look, Joe.  We're having a discussion now because of these kids.  Get a hold of yourself, Joe.  You're panicking.  Yeah.  Hang in there.  Just simmer down, Joe.  Go check out the Zeppelin channel for a little while.  We'll be done with this in about 15 minutes.  So listen to the new channel, the Jim Jones channel.  Jim Jones is lisping all his favorite hits. 
[02:58:30]  What's new, pussycat?  I'm thirsty.  Also known as Cinemagic or whatever the fuck that bore fest is.  All right there, Joe.  All right, buddy.  Say, we allow you to express your shit on our show.  That's right.  And then we go right back to what we were doing.  Yeah, it doesn't change our opinion, but you get to express it.  Let's go to Philly.  Rick, what are you doing?  Hey, listen.  That last guy was a prick.  The moment I started hearing the baby's cry, I turned it down and I turned it back up.  I mean, he could have done the same goddamn thing, but he's just a moron. 
[02:59:00]  Two cents.  His parents probably beat him as a kid.  Are you a parent?  Are you a parent?  I am a parent.  I have a three-year-old son.  But you know what?  It's always the parents I go.  It's hard to hear.  That's uncomfortable to listen to, man.  It's very difficult when I'm a parent.  I'm a parent myself, and it's very difficult to shut up.  You just hate these adults.  He could have turned a frigging radio down just like I did.  You know, he pays and subscribes to the same damn channel I do.  No, his volume was broken.  His volume and tuning was broken.  Probably. 
[02:59:30]  Probably.  He rammed his kid's head into it when the kid wanted ice cream.  You guys are great.  I listen to you every day.  It is disturbing.  I listen to you every day.  I'm right.  I know you do.  Wait.  Shut up.  We're terrific.  We rule.  Brian in Michigan.  What's up?  Hold on, Brian.  It is upsetting to listen to.  I mean, even though I don't have kids, it's like you really are listening to parents murder  their children.  And it's fucking, it makes you want to just stick a knife in these people for doing this.  Like, what kind of piece of shit is that devoid of any ability to self-think, to follow 
[03:00:00]  a lisping guy into a jungle and kill your own kids?  Kill him.  Game over.  Fucking bizarre.  Yeah.  Go ahead, man.  All right.  Let's go, Brian.  Problem out, Brian.  I got, I'm sorry, Anthony.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  No, go ahead.  All right.  Well, I got two things.  The first one, I'm from Michigan, white supremacist.  Love, Anthony.  Love, Anthony.  I'm listening to the show.  Appreciate you guys.  Anthony, I certainly hope you get line of the day for your line that the babies are  crying, but the dead ones aren't making any noise.  Right.  Well, apparently they weren't. 
[03:00:30]  I appreciate that.  Just a factual statement.  But, Anthony, I've got to ask you, could you stop making fun of the white babies dying?  They only had a couple of black kids in that group.  Please.  These are white children.  No.  Sir, sir, you're not very factual, sir.  It actually, there were very, a lot of black African people that were there.  Okay.  Yes, yes.  Continue to laugh and make fun.  No, that is hatred, sir, and I shall not stand here and listen to your hatred.  You're not standing, Anthony.  You're sitting.  I will not.  Well, I won't stand. 
[03:01:00]  All right.  Let's play another clip.  I think he's doing a wacky bit.  Of course.  He has to be.  We did Jim Jones' Death Assembly.  Look forward to it.  We did that clip, right?  Yes.  Something.  Oh, you said it wrong.  Something.  Something.  Jim Jones asked for the vat with the green C so the adults can begin.  The vat with the green C in, please.  Green?  It's not even a good cherry.  Green here so the adults can begin.  Thank you.  Don't, don't fail to follow my advice.  You'll be sorry.  Whoa. 
[03:01:30]  You'll be sorry.  We've set an example for others.  We've set 1,000 people who say we don't like the way the world is.  Yeah, they shut us.  Take our life from us.  We laid it down.  We got tired.  We didn't commit suicide.  We came in an act of revolutionary suicide protesting the conditions of an inhumane world.  Who's agreeing with this? 
[03:02:00]  No kidding.  Who's grabbing those cups and going, me first, me.  What's wrong with you?  Let me have the punch.  Yeah, that's the way the audio ends.  Yeah, it's just kind of, well, we got audio of a survivor, but.  Oh, yeah, let's do that.  Survivor.  I'm a survivor.  Someone who's like, I just dumped it out.  Yeah, I didn't drink it.  The end.  I just laid down.  Yeah, am I faked it?  Yeah.  All right.  A couple people tried to fake it, but they weren't good actors.  I'm dead. 
[03:02:30]  All right, let's say hi to Matt in Minnesota.  Matt.  Hey, guys, what's going on?  I just want to comment about that first guy I called.  I agree with him, man.  It's fucking brutal.  I understand you can turn down the radio and all that bullshit, but three of you guys,  you guys don't have any kids.  You guys don't know anything about that.  You guys have nieces and nephews and shit like that, but that doesn't hit home like  having kids.  Can I ask you a question, though?  Dude, I don't have, can I quickly say, I don't have kids, and yeah, that's very, very  bothersome to me.  Very bothersome. 
[03:03:00]  Let me ask you a question.  You hear the kids crying shit.  When's the last time you turned the news off?  Or like, or something like that?  Turn the news off?  Yeah.  You know.  Yeah, they don't show shit like this, you know?  Are you kidding?  Are you naive?  They show some real bad stuff.  The thing is, though, I love the fucking beheadings and fucking people getting shot in liquor stores  and the fucking gunshot ones in the head, but I don't know, something about this man  just kind of hit home to me, and I heard that little kid, you know, no!  Yes.  I fucking cringed, and I thought, holy fuck.  You're supposed to. 
[03:03:30]  It's disturbing audio, dude.  It's disturbing audio.  But understand, like you just said, you have a line, everyone has their line, but you  can't impose your line on other people.  No, I know.  I'm just saying it was fucking brutal.  I kind of got to agree, you know?  It's fucking horrendous.  All right.  We get it.  We disagree.  It is brutal.  We agree with that, but we're playing it.  We understand people are going to be disturbed or offended by this, whatever.  I mean, I can't watch beheading videos.  I can't.  I never thought we'd get phone calls because of that.  I didn't either.  I really didn't. 
[03:04:00]  And some of the fucking, you know, sideways jokes, you know, kind of knocking the kids  down a little bit, you know, saying, you know, fuck the kids.  Oh, they'd have been fucking, what, 35 years old now.  They'd have just been a waste of life sitting there.  Fucking hippie.  I mean, just because of the byproduct of the parents, they didn't have a fucking shot at  life, you know?  We understand that, sir.  It's called gallows humor, and we get it.  You think you're coming up with this new revelation?  You mean life is precious?  We got it.  Oh, Jimmy, of course I don't fucking think so, but I'm just saying, I'm just playing  with this thing, you know, we don't fucking knock the kids down and say, they're byproducts 
[03:04:30]  parents.  Fuck them.  That's not how it is.  Nobody means that, dude.  We're just shit-talking through horrible audio.  Anthony just said it.  He's shit-talking to annoy that caller.  That's what I did.  I took my little niece and nephew over the weekend, and I punted them out back over my  pool because, on a bet, I could punt my niece and nephews into the other person's yard.  That's okay with them.  He was fucking annoying the other caller, and you bought a hook, line, and sinker. 
[03:05:00]  I think I sit there and go, fuck the little dying children.  Do you honestly think I say that?  Of course I do.  I hate that I have to explain this.  The other guy was getting so pissed that I just throw that in to make him more mad.  Yes.  Do you honestly think I'm sitting here listening to that audio going, yeah, die, kids?  You're a fucking nut.  Everyone's crazy.  No one knows me.  No one knows me.  Who knows the real me?  Nobody. 
[03:05:30]  Anthony would have dated half of those kids.  I'm sensitive.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Punch out your face.  Let's say hi to Mike in Texas.  Mike.  Hi, Mike.  Welcome to the show.  I hope you like it.  Mike, if you want to just step up and take some of that green stuff.  Yeah.  My neighbor, I was about 12 or 13, and my neighbor was older, and he was in the Air Force.  Little Paul.  And he helped carry the bodies, you know, load them in the body bags and put them on the C-5. 
[03:06:00]  In a body bag.  That's a hell of a job right there, huh?  Yeah, he's pictured a couple times in life, and, you know, he said it was the worst thing  he's ever seen.  Their bodies were all bloated, and they had to stuff them in the body bags as best they  could.  How long were they there for before people got to them?  Well, I can't remember.  I think it was probably two or three days, because, I mean, the work got out pretty quick, 
[03:06:30]  but, you know, it took the Air Force a while to mobilize and figure out what they were going  to do.  Because I don't think they realized that there was that many dead.  Oh, okay.  Did they know the congressman had been murdered, or they just hadn't heard from him?  Well, that's how they figured out what was going on.  I mean, the word got out pretty quick that the congressman had been murdered.  Is there footage of him being murdered?  I'm not sure.  There's footage of them, like, running behind the plane, like they all started running behind  the plane and trying to hide behind tires and stuff.  Jeepers, creepers. 
[03:07:00]  Jesus.  I mean, and they didn't, the Air Force, well, I guess they couldn't, they didn't surprise  these guys with any respirators or any of that kind of stuff.  They all had Kurt just tied around their faces to try and stifle the smell.  I mean, it was just horrific.  I like how he said, and he told me it was the worst thing he'd ever seen.  It's like, what could possibly be worse?  Right, exactly.  And that, like, second place is a big drop-off.  Yeah.  You know, it's the word, like, roadkill or something.  The best part, too, is he told me, like, you can't figure that out on your own.  Well, it's the worst thing you've ever seen. 
[03:07:30]  Next to the Yankees blowing a 3-0 lead to the Red Sox.  That's right, right.  That was pretty bad.  This is right.  But stop joking.  Stop joking.  In this post-9-11 world, I mean, you know, we've all seen some pretty horrific stuff now,  but, I mean, back then, I guess it was just a...  I think we're in a post-saying post-9-11 world.  Exactly.  We're post that.  Exactly.  It's the same as a pre-9-11 world.  Yeah.  Except 9-11 was in the middle.  We know who the fucking problem is, and we're doing nothing about it. 
[03:08:00]  Pre and post, the same.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  I want to look that up on the information superhighway.  Todd the Trucker.  Todd, what are you hauling?  I'm hauling gas, guys.  Gas?  Gas, please.  All right.  We are gas.  You make big boom.  Go to it.  Yeah, I watched a special on one of the Discovery channels,  and they said on there when Jim Jones ordered them to drink all this Kool-Aid  that the ones that refused to do it, 
[03:08:30]  they injected them with needles with the Kool-Aid.  Oof.  Yeah.  Well, it was probably just cyanide.  They wouldn't put Kool-Aid in the means.  Yeah, a Kool-Aid needle.  Probably just the pure cyanide.  Get a little treat in your veins.  Yeah.  They actually had the big Kool-Aid guy come in.  Yeah, thank you for the Kool-Aid treat, everyone.  Yeah, Kool-Aid guy.  He pissed it in their mouth.  All right, let's go to Steve in New York, the big city, the big town,  the big apple.  The big apple.  What's up there, Steve?  Hey, man. 
[03:09:00]  Hey, on TV, they said that on the special over the weekend  that his general, there's one of the guys that shot him in the head,  there's one that killed him, and he was the one that also killed the senator,  and he's one of the survivors.  I think he's probably done in jail in Guyana still.  Really?  No, come on.  Yeah, yeah, because there was a bunch of survivors actually on the plane.  I think four people off the plane actually survived.  Oh, they didn't all die.  Okay.  Yeah, well, the one that was an aide for the senator, she survived. 
[03:09:30]  She got shot five times and survived, like, two days in the jungle.  Five times, and she's still alive.  Wait, she was shot hanging out in the jungle for two days?  Yeah, because after they shot him, they got away.  A bunch of them, a few of the kids and the aide, they ran to the jungle,  and then they ended up getting lost for, like, two or three days,  and they couldn't find him.  With five bullets in her?  Yeah.  Well, she laid in the bushes for a few days because she wasn't very mobile.  Dude, how much would that suck?  Five bullet wounds and you're getting bit by mosquitoes.  The bugs are on you.  Right. 
[03:10:00]  And now they're loving the blood that they're seeing on your body.  Oh, what a nightmare.  See, I could be saying worse things, like a pal talk I'm reading here,  a two kids, one cup.  See, that's a horrible thing to say, and you should be ashamed of yourself.  Yeah.  Yeah, the video that they had on the documentary this past week, it was pretty good.  I think just the audio is bad.  That video is horrible, man.  It really chills for me, but I couldn't turn it off.  Wow.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Take care.  I'm going to watch that.  We got audio of the survivor. 
[03:10:30]  She was 12 when it went down, and she survived this whole thing.  They were the shocking images broadcast throughout the world.  The world.  Deep in the jungles of Guyana, a remote agricultural settlement built by...  What a news ass.  He's just sitting there practicing.  No, let me try that again.  In the jungles of Guyana.  It just reminded me, when I was driving in this morning, I was listening to WINS.  Yeah.  And I guess they were having some technical difficulties, because they were broadcasting 
[03:11:00]  over the air.  Some guy practicing one of his reads.  Oh, really?  Oh, great.  It was layered over whatever story that they were airing, so he just kept going.  He kept going, okay.  Three, two, one, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Oh, wait.  You know what?  Let me do that again.  In three, two, one.  In three, two, one.  It went on for about four minutes.  We're here in Midtown, where...  Well, let me do it again.  Yeah.  Three, two, one.  We're here in Midtown.  That's better.  I think the story trumps your dumb voice.  Just talk. 
[03:11:30]  In Guyana.  In the jungle.  The jungles of Guyana.  John Tyler.  More info coming in from Atlanta.  He's slurring because he was hopped on Valium and other meds.  Is that true there, Sam?  I don't know.  He didn't do your search.  Okay.  Research.  His health was declining greatly by the time this happened.  Is that true, Sam?  He looked healthy to me.  But if he was dying himself, then this is easy.  Yeah.  You're just going to take people out with you.  Selfish prick.  That's what I'm thinking.  All right.  Let's get back to the news, man.  They were the shocking images broadcast throughout the world. 
[03:12:00]  Broadcast?  Deep in the jungles of Guyana, a remote agricultural settlement built by  the People's Temple, a religious group from California led by Jim Jones.  Thirty years ago, more than 900 members of the temple died in Jonestown,  almost all after drinking cyanide-laced grape drink.  Yolanda Williams was still there, and she began attending temple services  in San Francisco with her parents.  Years later, Jones summoned Williams and her family to his compound in Guyana. 
[03:12:30]  This wasn't all it was cooked up to be.  Really?  What told you that?  You know, I'm a little suspicious.  Right.  What?  The fact that he lisped and everyone was dead?  Right.  What tipped you off that it wasn't going to be a big party in the woods?  Right.  No Ferris wheel and dead senator.  Right.  This wasn't all it was cooked up to be.  It was not paradise. 
[03:13:00]  It was a concentration camp.  It was hell.  It was a plantation.  And there were things going on that I knew were totally ungodly and inhumane.  Williams and her family managed to flee Guyana just months before the mass suicide.  Just months.  Months.  Wow.  Cut out by the skin of your teeth.  Jesus Christ.  Wow.  I thought she like laid there and the Kool-Aid didn't get on her or something.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, please.  She fucking hit the bricks early.  That's like saying on 9-11 I almost took a flight. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I flew in August.  It's like three months before.  I'm technically a fucking survivor of the Trade Center because I was in the Trade Center  fucking eight years before they got down.  I was up there once.  I was in the windows of the world.  I had dinner once.  Think of what could have happened if I was there that day.  Fool around with the math a little bit, you know.  Yeah.  Could have been us.  Yeah.  Hey, more Survivor audio.  She was 12.  We made it back out.  Why are you laughing at it?  You're a survivor laughing. 
[03:14:00]  Because she lived.  Right.  She's got something to laugh about.  What made her laugh, you think?  All right.  We made it back out.  We made it back out.  The dead people, we missed that.  She was listening to Ant make fun of the dead babies.  Yeah.  We made it back out through the power and grace of God and our ability to negotiate with 
[03:14:30]  him.  Because the power of God.  But God said, fuck these people.  Fuck all the rest of the people.  You know, go fuck yourselves.  Yeah.  You need some grace.  900 of them have a sip.  Right.  Yeah.  I heard this lady loud and clear.  I didn't hear you dummies.  Yeah.  God.  Shut up.  Want to thank God for this win?  What?  The losing team didn't want it?  Didn't want it from God?  No.  Shut up.  Stupid.  We made it back out through the power and grace of God and our ability to negotiate  with him because he was in a drug-induced state. 
[03:15:00]  So we convinced him it was in his best interest to let us go and to prove to the people here  in the United States, the concerned citizens, other media people, that someone could get  out if they wanted to.  And we had the freedom, of course, to leave, come and go as we please.  30 years later, Williams says she's using her experience to be a voice for those who died.  She's now speaking out against Jim Jones.  Wow.  This woman is a day late and a dollar short on everything. 
[03:15:30]  After 30 years.  You know, I think he's actually dead.  I'm going to speak out on this guy.  Who's rebutting her?  But she waited 30 years.  She's alone at a debate podium.  Because no one will take up the other side, which is Jim Jones is a good egg.  Look, when you lose someone close to you, you know, the first day or two, you think to  yourself, they might be walking through that door.  30 years later, it's safe to say that the guy isn't going to come around. 
[03:16:00]  She's the voice, though, against Jim Jones.  Wow, all right.  I was trying to get that movement going.  All the supporters he has.  She's now speaking out against Jim Jones.  And he had, in my opinion, and I say this and I'm compelled to say this, he had 917 chances  to stop the annihilation.  And yet he continued to witness people dying one by one.  Well, she really is fucking bringing a new perspective on it. 
[03:16:30]  You know, until she said that, I really liked this guy.  And she said he witnessed people dying like he didn't, he killed them.  Yeah, yeah.  He gave them the drink that killed them.  He didn't just look.  Yeah.  Witness and execution.  Yes.  My friend, yeah.  Yeah.  One by one.  Jones died that same day of a gunshot wound to the head.  To the head.  When he was...  Oh, yeah.  He used to drive buses, like when he was still in the States, he would drive buses around 
[03:17:00]  the country and convince, like, you know, book town halls and stuff and do speeches and convince  people who would go to get on the buses with him and drive back to his place, like, you know,  across the country and start just joining his church like that.  How does he...  And then they convince...  And then they start selling their houses and stuff.  Because he was communist.  Dude, how do you do this?  I want to be a cult leader.  It sounds cool.  Until, you know, the killing part at the end. 
[03:17:30]  Is there a picture of him anywhere?  I know.  I've seen him.  I don't remember those dark...  Oh, yeah.  He almost looked like Muammar Gaddafi a little bit.  Didn't he look kind of Hawaiian or something?  Yeah.  There's something going on.  Black hair.  Yeah.  Dark feet.  Slick black hair.  Yeah, he was fucking swarthy.  Yeah.  He's a real Svengali, this guy.  Svengali.  He sure is, Jimmy.  He sure is.  Svengali.  Let's go to Chris the Truffle.  How do you brainwash people like that?  I don't know.  Tony Darrow was very funny.  It was... 
[03:18:00]  After Marshall White Apple, remember they had those people toss it and kill themselves?  Like, what was it?  50 of them or whatever?  Yeah.  Darrow goes, how do you get people...  I can't get three people to help me move.  There he is.  That's a young picture of him, though.  Yeah.  He looked different.  Yeah.  At the end, he really looked different.  Let's say hi to Chris the Trucker.  Chris, what are you hauling?  I'm hauling appliances right now.  Well, that's a pretty vague description.  Washing machines, blenders, what do you need?  Stoves, stuff like that.  Stoves. 
[03:18:30]  Durable goods.  I want to agree with you guys.  This stuff needs to be shown.  I know it's brutal.  I don't watch the beheadings because those are too brutal for me.  But they need to be shown because the world needs to see that there are psychos out there  that will convince you of anything in order to further their agenda.  And people need to wake up and not be following all this crap.  The KKK, the Aryan Nation, the Nazis, all this shit. 
[03:19:00]  Oh, I thought you were getting other examples.  In the name of God.  You know, they follow this in the name of God.  And everyone needs to wake up.  Stop following people.  Wake up and smell the grape drink.  I agree.  It needs to be shown.  You know, if people don't like it, turn it off.  I'm actually, me and this woman are speaking out against Jim Jones.  Yeah.  And I also understand she's condemned Hitler.  Yeah.  And a Chairman Mao.  A fucking, what a Johnny-come-lately. 
[03:19:30]  What a zero.  This is a real bandwagon jumper after the fact.  Holy shit.  What else?  She just picked the Cowboys over the Steelers in Super Bowl 13.  I was going to say, what else happened in 1978 that we could speak out against?  Because the Jim Jones one is covered.  There's got to be other stuff that happened in 78 we could speak out against.  Maybe she has the murderer's almanac.  And she knows what's going to happen.  Jesus.  Hey, there he is.  Yeah.  See, he's kind of got a...  With thick black hair.  A bullet tore right through that fucking dude.  Ah, hell yeah. 
[03:20:00]  He looks like Roy Orbison.  He's got a wedding ring on.  Was he married?  No.  No fucking wedding ring he's got there.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Jared.  Jared.  Jared.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  I have never heard this audio before.  And I got to admit, it has to be played.  And that douchebag that called up, fuck him, man.  This shit needs to be played.  It's disgusting.  It's morbid.  But you know what?  Now, now.  That was his opinion. 
[03:20:30]  That's right.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Now, now.  It's a satellite radio and you have 200 channels to choose from.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, good show this morning.  I enjoyed it.  My dad was listening to...  Good show.  Uh, James, New Mexico.  What's going on?  Yeah.  There's this, uh, history channel, uh, documentary that came out a few years ago.  It's called Paradise Lost.  Yes.  Um...  That was a John Milton poem.  If you go to, uh, YouTube and, and search Jonetown, Jonetown Paradise Lost, you'll see there's 
[03:21:00]  like nine parts to it.  It describes how Jim Jones was too much of a coward to take the Kool-Aid himself.  He had to shoot himself in the head.  Uh, I don't know if you want to say, you know, that's more of a cowardly way than another  way.  Like, any way you do it is pretty, uh...  You gotta have some balls on you, I think.  Well, he was too afraid to, you know, for the pain that it might have been.  I don't even like the taste of grape.  Yeah.  Why couldn't he do both?  Do the old Hitler, you pipe down. 
[03:21:30]  Dude, how come he's not calling History Channel for, you know, letting them know not to play  this stuff either?  Does, um, cyanide, I wonder what it tastes like and how does it work.  It said on the documentary that I watched...  It's delicious.  It said it had a very bitter taste.  I don't know where they got that information from.  Like dark chocolate, Sam?  Yeah!  Like dark chocolate?  That's what the Goebbels children said, too, when they were being killed in the bunker.  That it was very bitter.  I'm an expert on child death. 
[03:22:00]  You love it so much.  When they're killed by their parents.  What were you saying, sir?  Didn't matter, Jimmy.  I'll just talk over it again because I could give a flying fuck.  I'm sure.  And I'll just say whatever I want because it's my show and I don't care what this guy is saying,  quite frankly.  Sorry, fellas.  So he could just...  What?  No, I didn't hear your point.  No, I'm sure, you know...  What the hell is, like, 10-3rd...  Yeah, it's getting there.  Okay.  What?  I'm sure the point...  Yeah, it's just... 
[03:22:30]  I don't care what he says.  All right, enough of you.  Don't you understand?  I'm never going to let you talk.  Hang up.  Let's say hi to Dan.  Dan, you had family members?  They were part of a cult?  Dan the man!  That's what I like calling anyone named Dan.  Exactly.  Makes him cool.  Exactly.  Go ahead, Dan.  Hey, I had some family members that...  Oh, my shifters were...  Dan the brand doesn't sound as cool.  No.  Go ahead.  Dan, Dan, likes it in the can. 
[03:23:00]  All right.  Go ahead.  Dan the Charlie Chan, you're up.  I love you, Jimmy.  I'm only kidding you, Dan the fan.  What's up?  Dan the...  I want to call him Dan the Dan.  Because he's Dan.  Now, what's up, Dan the fan?  Go ahead.  Anyway, Dan, I...  The Freeman standoff of the Montana...  Right.  My sisters were in that, and I remember... 
[03:23:30]  That shit fucked me up for the rest of my life, as far as religion goes.  Are they okay?  Every time...  All right.  You know, I try to go to church or something like that, I get these images popped back in  my head of my sisters being in this compound with guys around there with guns, starting to  kill them.  Hold on.  Hey, Dan, don't mess with the Zohan.  I want to know...  Are your sisters okay?  Yeah, I'll be honest.  I'm Dan.  I'll use my right hand, so...  That's good.  Oh, that's cool.  There's a D in that.  Well, I gave a stroke when I switched, so... 
[03:24:00]  Are they...  Are your sisters alive, right?  My sister, one of them is still pretty fucked up.  She ended up getting impregnated by one of the leaders, and I've got a nephew that they're  trying to...  He doesn't even know what happened, but it's...  You know, she's pretty messed up in the head.  She's got some major, like, sexual issues.  She's...  I mean, just... 
[03:24:30]  She'll...  You know, she's even talking about having sex with bulls.  She's...  What?  I mean, that kind of stuff really messes...  Wait.  You know, you kiddo...  Talking sex...  Had sex with what?  Animals.  Ooh.  Dogs, cats, that kind of stuff.  My sister's a fucking good egg.  Hold it.  Shenanigans.  Why?  I'm just calling shenanigans.  That's just too much stuff.  I don't believe this guy.  Shenanigans, we can get one of my sisters.  I don't believe you.  Can we get the one that was fattened up by the cult leader?  He pumped that culting seed into her. 
[03:25:00]  Pouting loads right in that fucking womb.  How long were they involved with the cult?  I was asking if they were a lot.  I wasn't involved with the cult.  It was my stepmother that ended up disappearing with my sisters right as they're getting divorced.  Okay.  They ended up going on a really interesting tour of the U.S.  The whole motorhome.  It's more interesting than this call.  Was the cult leader endowed?  Was he clipped?  Big dick on the cult leader?  Yeah. 
[03:25:30]  I don't know.  I never met the cult leader.  He's still locked up.  Yeah, but you could have heard from your sister.  Did you say big dick?  What animal did she compare him to?  Nice big cock.  What?  Great Dane pony.  Donkey dick or old rooster penis?  Old rooster penis?  What cult?  What cult was this guy the member of or the leader of?  What cult?  Fast.  Go.  What cult or why?  No, no.  What cult?  What cult?  The womb wreckers of the Lord.  There was a polygamous cult.  What's the name of the cult? 
[03:26:00]  Freedmen.  They're called the Freedmen.  The Freedmen?  The Freedmen.  The Jewish cult?  Oh, the Freedmen.  Yeah.  Oh, I thought you meant the Freedmen.  No, the Freedmen.  Oh, the Freedmen.  Yeah.  Oh.  Their compound was up in Montana.  I think it was out by Butte somewhere.  It's the Freedmen.  They're stalked in the toilet.  Wow.  All right, listen.  We got a couple people that died in Jonestown. 
[03:26:30]  Well, their relatives are calling in.  Charlie in Louisiana.  Charlie.  Hey, old man.  What's up?  And Jimmy.  Hi.  What's up, Charlie?  Yes.  I had my aunt and uncle and their two children died in Jonestown.  And, dude, it's not even funny sitting here listening.  I like you guys, man.  But, you know, that's not even funny.  You got to realize we're playing something as a news event.  It's like any time you play something.  If you're telling the truth, we're playing this as a world event. 
[03:27:00]  And it's easier to be detached from a world event than anybody.  If we look at it, like, too closely, like every person that was personally hurt by it,  then technically we can't make fun of anything.  Can't talk about anything.  You know, my poor old grandma has the Alzheimer's, and she's, like, nutty as a fruitcake.  And how many times do we make Alzheimer's jokes?  Never, because you said we can't.  I have a famous...  I know.  I've forbidden all of you from even speaking of it.  But it's like there are other things, afflictions people have had that we know, like, personally know, 
[03:27:30]  and then we talk about it.  So, you know something?  Fuck you.  I don't care about you or your dead family.  We're going to talk about whatever we want to talk about because...  The kicker with that is, Ant...  What?  ...is that they couldn't understand a fucking thing he was saying, and they couldn't stand  grape Kool-Aid.  Frank is...  That's pretty good.  That was kind of...  That was pretty good.  That's why I told him to go fuck himself. 
[03:28:00]  You fuck ya.  I thought he was serious.  That was good.  He got me, too.  James in Tennessee, what's up?  Boys, how are you today?  Good, James.  There's a lot of stuff that's being said.  There's a bunch of shit, evidently, because he was married.  He was married for about 20 years.  He was gay.  He did...  He got arrested in California for a lewd act in a bathroom.  They never came out and said what it was.  But he did have sex with men and women.  He still had it.  No animals.  That dude before... 
[03:28:30]  Holy shit, man.  Yeah, he...  There was a bunch of people that did escape.  The girl that y'all had on there, the black lady, was saying that she's campaigning against him.  She was pregnant when she escaped.  Her son, when he was a 19-year-old, actually killed a cop.  He's in jail forever now.  The man that was his right-hand man, it was paroled in 2002.  He's out and about now.  How is he out and about?  A lot of stuff that's being said is wrong.  Wait, the guy that was out, his right-hand man that killed people? 
[03:29:00]  Out and about.  He killed people?  He can't just be out and about.  No, he's out and about.  He got paroled in 2002, smartasses.  You know what his name is?  I would like to Google him.  I'm serious.  I'm not even kidding.  And how was that woman pregnant when she left, when she was 12?  Sounds like something.  Well.  No, the woman, there was a woman that left there.  Look it up.  I mean, CNN broadcasted it the other day.  You don't call me a liar.  Just look it up.  Is the guy who got out, who was his right-hand man, did he kill anybody or was he just there? 
[03:29:30]  No, he did kill some people, but he didn't get out.  He was in jail and he got paroled in 2002.  Right, because he was a good boy?  Mm-hmm.  I don't know if he was a good boy.  He might have sucked somebody's dick to get out.  I don't know, but he got paroled in 2002.  Probably he's out right now.  Probably sucked a dick to get out.  That's all it takes to get out.  It's a win-win.  There were stories about him, Jim Jones, going up to guys behind the scenes and saying,  you know, I'll fuck you in the ass if you want me to. 
[03:30:00]  Really?  Like this guy doing an interview for the documentary, he was like, no.  I'll fuck you in the ass if you want me to?  If you want, I'll fuck you in the ass.  Not even like you can fuck me in the ass?  Right.  I'll fuck you in the ass.  And the guy was like, no thanks.  And he was like, that's fine.  Just let me know.  I wonder if he had any takers.  He had a two-hour thing on it over the weekend.  It was with Soledad O'Brien.  She went there and had all the people on it.  That fucking is.  It's great to go there 30 years after this.  Soledad.  Wow.  We're giving her a little fucking in the ass. 
[03:30:30]  He's God.  He's had it with us.  According to the Wikipedia for Jones, in 73, he was arrested for soliciting a man  in a movie theater bathroom known for homosexual activity.  All right.  Wow.  But this is my favorite.  On at least one account exists of a sexual abuse of a male member of his congregation  in front of fellow followers, and it was in order to prove the man's own homosexual  tendency.  Right.  Not his.  Exactly.  Ha, I got you. 
[03:31:00]  How did he get his dick card then?  If he wasn't a homosexual himself there, Danny.  Well, they don't say to what extent the abuse was.  Ah, he's that good, though.  So he could have got a butt finger in or something.  He could fake it like that and get a rod and fuck someone in the ass and go, look,  see?  You're gay.  They were saying that they weren't allowed to talk to each other at all in the compound.  Wow.  But like, once things did come up a little bit, like one guy would say, yeah, he said  he wanted to fuck me in the ass.  Yeah, me too.  The other guy is exactly what happened.  Oh, he kind of spread like wildfire.  Yeah, he fucked me in the ass.  The guy's like, he fucked me in the ass. 
[03:31:30]  Ah, that wacky guy.  All right.  Why don't he keep those dumb glasses on while he fucking, while he poked you in the shitter  before he killed you and your family a few weeks later?  This guy was all gelled the whole time.  What a dick.  With Kool-Aid.  He's just, he's a dick in your ass.  Yeah.  And some cyanide in your beverage.  Wow, what a, how tempting to follow this guy.  Oh, that's good.  How good a sales pitch do you have to have to convince people to let you fuck him in 
[03:32:00]  the ass and then kill themselves?  Yeah.  I guess it's smooth talking.  I got a clip of a news person reporting from Jonestown 30 years ago.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen, goodness gracious.  Oh, that's terrible.  Oh, no, that's terrible.  That was fucking an ass.  Yeah.  That was a fuck in the ass.  You could tell.  Uh, let's say hi to Graham in Pennsylvania.  Graham.  Hey, what's going on, you bunch of cave beasts? 
[03:32:30]  Mm-hmm.  Ling-a-lo-ing.  No, I'll just fuck with you.  That ain't gonna catch on.  I thought it was kind of funny.  Well, uh, anyways.  Yeah, I was calling, Jimmy was asking how cyanide works.  It is a chemical asphyxiant, and it prevents your body from absorbing oxygen.  Do you suffocate, or do you get knocked out?  Yeah, well, it just, uh, you end up, so your, your cells suffocate, because they can't absorb 
[03:33:00]  oxygen anymore.  Does it make you so you can't breathe, though, or do you, like, do you pass out first?  No, you can still breathe, but the, the cyanide actually blocks the receptors in your cells.  So you'd pass out, your brain would get no oxygen, you would pass out.  Yeah, just any, all your cells.  Your heart gets no oxygen, so it stops, your lungs, everything just kind of stops.  You can probably breathe.  Yeah, you can try to breathe, but it's gonna, it's gonna go fast.  How long?  I would think.  I would think that would take fucking, how long? 
[03:33:30]  I think if you, if you take cyanide, you only have, like, 30 seconds to administer the  antidote.  What's the antidote?  You gotta be injected in your heart.  Chism.  Be funny if it was Guy in his dirt, and nobody knew it.  It's all right there at their mouth.  It's all around you.  Yeah.  You even got some on your lip as you fall face-versed into it.  All right, get back to work.  Y'all have a good day.  All right, we learned about cyanide today.  Wonderful.  One of these guys works for Excedrin.  Yeah, whoops. 
[03:34:00]  Tylenol, better reference.  We're getting ready to play, what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  Jim Jones was married.  The congressman's aide is now a congresswoman.  Larry, oh, here we go.  Ryan in New Jersey, what's up?  Yeah, hey, guys.  Just wanted to let you know, the only guy that was ever tried was a man named Larry Layton.  He went to jail in 1984, and he was paroled in 2002.  Okay.  How does he get paroled if he was the right-hand man?  He was convicted of conspiracy for criminal acts relating to the murders. 
[03:34:30]  He was never actually convicted of any murders.  Okay.  Hey, Jimmy, we were in the same second grade class.  Really?  Linden off school.  What's your name?  Ryan Mattis, Mrs. Kiersting's class.  Mrs. Kiersting, I vaguely remember.  Why did you leave school there?  Why did I leave school there?  Meaning like you only went to second grade together.  Second grade, what are you...  Because you went on to middle school.  I went to medical school.  No, but what happened with third grade? 
[03:35:00]  I had Mrs. Houck.  Yeah, I think I had Mrs....  Was it Riker or something like that in third grade?  I don't remember.  But you lived on Fox Road, right?  I did, yeah.  Yeah, I lived on Orange Street.  Jimmy.  Did you guys ever hang out and play Monster Rain?  Yeah.  No.  Did you ever suck Jimmy's little penis?  No.  Was Jimmy a weirdo in second grade?  What do you think?  No, seriously.  Did you got a remembrance of Jimmy as a weirdo?  Cute little boy, though.  Yeah.  He was very tussleable at that age.  I've heard. 
[03:35:30]  And Mrs. Osborne, do you remember the principal's name?  At the time it was Mr. Fischelli, wasn't it?  Fischelli, it certainly was.  His stepson was a friend of mine, John.  Paul Fischelli?  And he actually married my sixth grade teacher, Mrs. Miller.  Who did?  Mr. Fischelli.  Inter-teacher marriage.  Wow.  My last name is Hagus.  Paul Hagus.  H-A-R-G-I-U-S.  The U is silent.  Hagus.  Yeah, Paul Hagus.  I really enjoy the show.  Thanks, man. 
[03:36:00]  All right.  Take care.  Hey, wait, dude, before you hang up, is anybody that we knew dead or, like, all day long?  All right.  Well, why don't you just go?  He is.  Uh, let's say hi to Pat and Bill more.  Pat.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Yes.  Hi, Pat.  Cyanide is an excruciatingly painful death.  How would you know?  Yeah.  I read stuff about when they use cyanide in gas chambers.  There's also a really, really great documentary PBS did on American Experience called Jonestown,  The Life and Death of the People's Church, I believe.  It's interviews with a whole bunch of survivors who were involved with the cult, how they got brought 
[03:36:30]  into it.  Really should check it out.  All right.  Thank you.  I want to look up this guy, Larry.  But by tomorrow, we're not even going to remember this, because then it's going to be 30 years  plus one day.  Today's the big day.  Yeah, I remember.  I was 27 when that happened.  I was there, and I went around pinching fannies.  I thought they was all sleeping.  I'm like, all those heinies.  I didn't know what to do, so I pulled down a few undershorts.  I'm like, I'm like, what's going on here? 
[03:37:00]  Time to play, what did we learn on the O.P. and Anthony show?  Here comes...  What did we learn?  What did we learn?  What?  What?  What?  Yes, what did we learn on the O.P. and Anthony show?  Let's say hi to Michael on Long Island.  Michael.  Yeah. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah.  Today we learned that Dan Dan's sister takes it in the can.  We did learn that.  Yeah.  I learned that somehow, someway, Howard Stern is going to blame us  for what happened in Jonestown.  Exactly.  Look out.  What did we learn sponsored by?  Webex still?  Are we holding a meeting still, or what?  Webex.  Rob, Sacramento, what's going on?  What did you learn on the O.P. and Anthony show today?  Well, I learned that if you want to have lots of gay sex  and stop cruising movie theaters, you just start a cult. 
[03:38:00]  Start a cult.  Have gay sex.  There you go.  So, Webex.com, sponsors, line of the day.  Also, what did we learn?  You hold the meetings, you make presentations,  and you do it from the comfort of your own home.  How handy.  Or office.  Check it out at Webex.com.  Let's say hi to Penis Wrinkle.  Penis Wrinkle?  The Penis Wrinkle.  What's up?  Yeah, I learned that if you buy Dennis Leary's book at Amazon.com,  it refers you to Jimmy Norton's I Hate Your Guts. 
[03:38:30]  Thank you.  It certainly does.  Oh, look at that.  Yes.  It's like a double gift bag for Christmas.  What a gift.  Where did my book go?  Speaking of Dennis Leary.  What a lovely gift.  What's up on your CD player?  Oh, there it is.  Why We Sucked.  That was Leary's new book.  And he's got a signing today, Penn Plaza 730, where Jimmy did his.  Barnes & Noble, Jimmy, down there?  No, it's the Borders at Penn Station 730.  That's the new Jim Norton.  That is a good tranny voice. 
[03:39:00]  I'm using my radio voice.  That's like, what's his name, though, man?  Richard Pryor's a writer.  Oh, no, Paul Mooney's like that.  He's like, yeah, Paul Mooney, right?  Yeah, Paul Mooney.  I know the brother wouldn't do it.  Queen.  Paul Mooney.  Brad, West Virginia.  What did we learn on the O.P. and Anthony Show?  Hi, Brad.  Welcome aboard.  Today I learned that if you get fucked in the ass, it makes you want to kill yourself.  There you go.  That's a great lesson, Brad.  Very nice.  Playing all the hits. 
[03:39:30]  Let's say hi to Steve in California.  Steve.  Welcome aboard, Steve.  Steve.  Hello.  Here's the nighttime grooves.  All right, Steve, you don't get a chance.  Let's say hi to Clint, the trucker.  Clint, what are you, my friend, Holland?  I am hauling cows today.  Ugh.  Why?  I hate passing those things.  Gotta get past those cows.  They can take them to make hamburgers.  Yeah.  But where the fuck do the cows need to go? 
[03:40:00]  They gotta go to the slaughter plant, man.  Slaughter yard.  They're just in there thinking, hey, this is a great ride.  Oh, look.  I get to go somewhere.  Look.  They look out the slats and go, look how fast I'm running.  Oh, time for a vacation.  This is great.  Where are we all going?  Oh, I hope it's the Adirondacks.  And then they put them in the pan, and then they put them up that little chute.  Yeah.  And then the fucking bolt gun, like from No Country for Old Men, goes through their skull.  Yeah.  And then the next one steps up, and same thing.  They're slipping all over that blood. 
[03:40:30]  Jimmy.  New Jimmy scares me.  Yeah.  That's my new character.  Who is it?  Ted what?  No.  Smooth, jazzy Jim.  Smooth, jazzy Jim.  Yeah.  Oh, smooth, jazzy Jim.  I'm playing some hits.  Yuck.  It's a little song by Cam Calloway.  Ah.  Cam Calloway.  Yeah.  Smooth, jazzy Jim. 
[03:41:00]  That's right here.  I play jazz.  The thing I like about this is I know it probably hurts his voice so bad to do that.  You'd be surprised.  It's like sucking on a lozenge.  I'll see you tomorrow.  Clint, what did you learn on the show?  Smooth, jazzy Jim indeed.  I learned that dead babies don't make any noise.  Hey, you did learn that.  Yes.  Oh, here's the good one.  Pussy Pimple from Pennsylvania.  Righto.  Is this the Pussy Pimple?  This is the Pussy Pimple.  Right.  We feel honored, sir. 
[03:41:30]  What did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  Just don't squeeze my head.  I learned that Aunt Me wants to kill all the little children on the plane.  Why not?  Well, we did learn that.  Well, there was a little rascal.  Right or wrong, though.  They want to wake you up, won't they?  Steve from Bay Show is calling you.  Take a nap.  Steve from Bay Show is calling you smooth, jazzy shim.  At least he's not calling me smooth, jazzy jim.  That would be the lie right there.  Yeah, talk like this.  Joanie, what's up? 
[03:42:00]  Smooth house chachi.  See, I'm still funny.  Yes, this is Joanie.  I don't care, bitch.  Talk at me.  What's up, Joanie?  Hi, I would like a t-shirt if it would be possible.  A t-shirt of what?  Oh, the Opie and Anthony show.  You can have one, but do you know the phrase that pays?  Do we have a t-shirt for this broad?  She has to know the phrase that pays.  Do we give anything away anymore?  I don't think we have any more t-shirts.  I don't think we have chick t-shirts.  Are you willing to buy one? 
[03:42:30]  I would certainly buy one, but I don't have the internet, so this is the only way I can get one.  Right, why would you in 2008?  Why don't you have the internet?  Can't afford it.  Yeah, I'm not really interested in it, believe it or not.  I don't believe it.  Why?  Fucking Laura Ingalls?  Maybe.  My throat's down there.  You're in Nebraska.  It's kind of a necessity in the year 2008.  Like, let me see what the news about corn is today.  I don't give a shit about corn.  Why?  You're in Nebraska.  I don't have anything to do with corn.  What do you do in Nebraska? 
[03:43:00]  What do you pick out of your shit when you're bored?  I listen to the ONA show and the Ron and Pei show.  That's what I do.  And that's it?  Pretty much.  How do you eat?  What gives you money?  Not corn.  What?  What do you do to make a living?  What kind of job do you have?  Please.  How do you make money?  Please, if you will.  I am unemployed.  And you're on unemployment?  Why do you have a robot for us?  Pay you?  No unemployment.  You're with a man?  I am with a man.  I got a man. 
[03:43:30]  What does he do?  What does he do?  To put food on the table.  He's an iron worker.  An iron worker.  That's a little rough these days.  He used to build bridges.  Remember you were talking about that the other day?  No, we don't remember.  And we were figuratively speaking.  Right.  Building bridges.  Me too.  So what...  Me too.  Does he get mad that you don't work?  I mean, get the fuck to work.  Not at all.  Both of our agreements said I don't.  Thank you.  Well, what do you do then, shortcake?  I listen to you, Jimmy. 
[03:44:00]  But I mean, because when you're not listening to me.  I listen to Ron and Fez.  All right, when you're not listening to Ron and Fez.  Replays.  Yeah, Joni, you're like emotionless.  We're trying to get a little emotion out of you.  Yeah, you're like clubster to Joni.  I know I'm emotionless.  Why, though?  I know.  Because I live in Nebraska, and all I do is listen to XM.  Yeah.  All right.  I don't know if we...  Do we have a T...  Where's Fatso?  Do we have a T-shirt for the dog?  Jesus.  Who are you talking about?  Exactly.  They're going to clunk heads running in. 
[03:44:30]  Do we have a T-shirt laying around?  I don't know.  We might have some panties or something.  God forbid.  Are you a big girl?  I'm not at all.  You're a big girl?  All right.  Well, if we're going to send you a T-shirt, we need what size...  What size are you?  14.  What size is 14?  That way, 124.  Does that help you?  If we can't find a shirt, will you take a shoebox full of Doody?  Dude, come on.  No, we're serious.  We'll send a Doody.  Yeah, we'll send that out.  In a box.  It's Opie Anthony and Jimmy Doody.  The pro-Keds box.  Just think of...  You could tell your friends. 
[03:45:00]  That's right.  You could make little figures out of it.  You suppose if I had friends, I'd have this much time to listen to your shirt?  Okay, makes sense.  You got no friends.  You are really, like...  You're not fun.  You're, like, a Stepford wife or something.  What was your nickname in high school?  Morphine drip?  Right.  Right.  We're trying to crack her.  What do you do for fun, besides listen to the show? 
[03:45:30]  Mmm.  Mmm.  She probably rolls a marble down into a wok.  Oof.  Wow.  Hold on.  Holy shit.  I just thought it was such a funny, banal thing to do.  You certainly thought wrong.  I couldn't have been wronger.  Wow.  What does she do for fun?  She has Kool-Aid and lays face down the dirt. 
[03:46:00]  Would have been a more humorous thought.  Yes.  And more exciting.  I watched that documentary you were talking about, and cyanide tastes like almonds.  Did you know that?  I've actually heard it smells like almonds from Coroner's.  Hmm.  Really?  Yes.  All right.  What do we got for her?  We're out of shirts.  I thought that was arsenic.  Ah, cyanide.  Cyanide?  Yeah, that's why it was called.  The original candy was cyanide joy.  But they figured no one would buy it.  And he makes up for his wok joke. 
[03:46:30]  I love wok jokes.  I'm going to fucking throw a few more in.  Yeah, throw some wok jokes.  I'm the wok joke king.  That was my nickname before.  It was Jazzy.  It was Jazzy Jim.  I like wok jokes.  Look at the fat boy wok.  He does nothing around here.  Least of all, wok. 
[03:47:00]  See?  We love the wok joke.  Oh, wok's a rule.  What do we got for Jody so we can go home?  Exactly.  You want a table?  You got some wok and wall?  Well, there's no t-shirts.  But I was trying to find some.  I was trying to find something that would fit her.  So I got a copy of.  Self-inflicted gunshot.  I got her a copy of.  An autographed copy of Ralphie May's Prime Cut DVD.  All right.  She's going to be awesome.  Wait, let me see it first.  Okay.  I also have an autographed copy of Dom Herrera's comedy CD. 
[03:47:30]  What else?  And an autographed.  We'll send you the pieces, by the way, Jody.  An autographed.  Do you have any articles of clothing I could wear?  Wow.  Do you have any articles of clothing?  Mine are covered in blood.  I've just killed my entire family.  I need some clothing.  I also have here an autographed Louis C.K. DVD.  Oh, wow.  I'm sorry.  A strap-on?  Would you like a strap-on?  That's mince here.  I'm sorry.  Oh.  I get it.  All right, Jody.  Hold down the line. 
[03:48:00]  Yeah.  Do you want a hat?  No, I don't wear hat.  We have a walk with the chin strap.  You're good for making retard haircuts.  Yeah.  Then you get thrown into a fucking helicopter in Apocalypse Now.  Anyone else see the irony that this woman needs the internet more than anyone else alive?  We'll give you a walk hat.  Do you know where the Parker Meridian is?  I love that guy. 
[03:48:30]  He rules.  That's the best.  He's an Imperial Trooper helmet on.  Hey, can you talk to Peter Cushing for us?  And give the message to Lord Vader that we don't like the fact that he looked like Donald  Pleasence in the fucking third one?  Oh, sugar plump.  I gotta take such a piss right now.  Yeah, we're going.  Jody, I don't know.  We don't have shirts.  Can someone bring me towels?  I spilled water by the electrical equipment.  Oh, no.  You put it by your book, too. 
[03:49:00]  Your book got a little damp.  That's right.  I know, Dennis.  I get a shirt.  Oh, that's damn.  Jody, you call us tomorrow.  We'll try to hunch it down a shirt.  I know MyRadioStore.com, Ziggy's Joint has them.  Yes.  Right.  You have to ask Peter for that.  Hold on a minute.  Seriously.  If you would like an Opie and Anthony t-shirt, you can call 1-866-INEEDXM, and they have  a very wonderful variety of Opie and Anthony and Ron and Fez related apparel.  And we'll try to get you something for free, Jody.  Okay, so you call us tomorrow.  We just don't have any in stock.  All right.  Why would we?  Why would we have stuff to give away? 
[03:49:30]  Do you want a...  Why would that work?  Yeah, exactly.  Do you want a smooth, jazzy, Jim pair of earmuffs?  I'd like a book of yours if you'd want to send me that, if you'd sign up.  All right.  That's not happening.  All right.  Go screw.  I got to pee.  All right, Jody.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Love you.  We all took our headphones off, so if you're still talking, we don't know.  Go pee first.  Pee first?  We're ending the show. 
[03:50:00]  Jody, you just kind of talk, because people will hear you for a while, all right?  Oh, you want me to send the show out today?  Hold on.  I hear mumbling.  Now I got to put the headphones back on.  What, Jody?  I said you want me to send the show out today.  Yeah, why don't you, uh, you could say whatever you want, but wait for the door to close.  You'll hear the door close in the background, and then it's time for you to go and do whatever  the hell you want, and as long as you want.  That's how we end today, okay?  Mm-hmm.  All right, hold on.  I'm getting up now.  This is going to be your ship in a minute. 
[03:50:30]  Wallet in the pocket.  Picking up the BlackBerry.  Coat is on.  The, uh, toothpick thing to clean out my, my, uh, food pocket is in my pocket.  Headphones are off.  I got my signed Dennis Leary book that I have just picked up.  Jody, I can't hear you anymore.  I'm walking toward the door.  I'll wait for the door to slam, and then the show's yours.  Danny, have a good day.  Bye.  Travis, have a good day.  Sam, have a good day. 
[03:51:00]  Hold on.  Here comes the slam, Jody, if you can still hear me.  I can hear you.  Thanks, guys.  Have a great day, and I hope your wedding lasts longer than most people, Opie.  Jimmy, take care of those squirts.  And Anthony, keep up your warm sense of humor.  And your mom's box.  Thank you.  Thank you. </pre>
