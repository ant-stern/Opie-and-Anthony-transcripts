<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, largely revolving around the London Olympics, but also delving into personal anecdotes, political commentary, and current events.  The show began with a focused critique of the Olympics. The hosts, along with an unnamed third person in the studio, mercilessly mocked the opening ceremonies, specifically the Queen's expression and the lack of a tribute to victims of a London terrorist attack.  Their commentary heavily criticized Olympic broadcasters Mary Carrillo (whose dentures and vocal delivery were ridiculed with audio examples) and Bob Costas (whose dramatic style was mocked).  The discussion frequently devolved into explicit commentary on the physiques of female Olympic athletes from various countries,  including detailed descriptions of their bodies, weight, and perceived attractiveness. This included lengthy segments on a plus-sized synchronized diver and speculation about a bulge in a gymnast's leotard.  The hosts also criticized the new gymnastics rules limiting athletes per country and expressed their distaste for water polo and beach volleyball, again focusing on the athletes' appearances.  Their own and others' reactions to their Olympic-related tweets, including those from Samuel L. Jackson, were discussed, along with a discussion on betting on the Knicks and a photo of Lala Anthony.  The segment concluded with more commentary on Serena Williams's body and another woman's posterior, followed by a brief mention of a woman's body odor at a strip club.

The next segment started with a negative account of a stripper encounter, transitioning to further disparaging remarks about the bodies of female Olympic athletes and their perceived post-career unattractiveness.  Serena and Venus Williams were briefly mentioned.  The conversation then shifted to the London Olympics opening ceremony’s song selection (debating Pink Floyd, Sir Paul McCartney, and The Clash's "London Calling"), followed by a humorous anecdote about a sexually suggestive typo in a text message.  A lengthy discussion then analyzed video clips of Muhammad Ali at various Olympic events, focusing on his physical state and the perceived inappropriateness of his appearances. This included clips from the 1996 Atlanta and 1992 Barcelona Olympics.  The segment concluded with Jim Norton detailing his chaotic trip to the Montreal Comedy Festival, including canceled flights, a costly last-minute flight, and his comedy set focusing on the Aurora, Colorado shooting and the media's response. Norton defended Dane Cook against criticism for insensitive jokes, arguing that the media was more culpable for fueling copycat violence.  The segment ended with Norton recounting a bizarre experience at a transgender bar where he lost his wallet, ultimately recovering it after a lap dance and a reward offer.

The following segment began with the hosts discussing Bob Kelly's screen test for *Bronx Warrants*.  The hosts then recounted their respective weekends: one with a lavish Yankees game experience, encountering Darrell Strawberry and Keith Olbermann, and the other with a less glamorous pizza party in New Rochelle, encountering rats and kittens and Philip Seymour Hoffman.  The conversation covered Mayor Bloomberg's policies, a poorly performed national anthem by an 11-year-old (with audio clips played), a karaoke night at Iggy's, and gun violence in New York City and Salt Lake City.  This included news reports of shootings and a stabbing, contrasting with an instance where a civilian stopped a stabbing.  The hosts discussed the Second Amendment and Justice Scalia's interpretation, using historical weaponry as examples.  The segment concluded with more discussion of the Yankees game and a NASCAR clip.

The final segment heavily focused on gun control, debating the Founding Fathers' potential views on contemporary gun laws and the interpretation of the Second Amendment.  The hosts discussed background checks and ease of gun acquisition. One host expressed a desire for automatic weapons.  The conversation then shifted to unrelated topics, including a humorous anecdote about Jerry Jones using the phrase "glory hole days," a video of a crowded Chinese wave pool, and recently released images of the moon showing remnants of the Apollo missions.  Mayor Bloomberg's initiative to restrict baby formula access in NYC hospitals was criticized. The segment concluded with promotion for their Chicago shows (including a pig race and a visit to the Willis Tower),  a potential visit to *Chicago Hope* filming locations, and a detailed recounting of one host’s awkward sexual encounter in a Greyhound bus station restroom.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, fuck.  DD.  DD.  Oh, man.  Maybe we should do our warm-ups before the mics go live.  I gotta tell you.  Yes.  Oh, I gotta...  Good morning. Good morning.  Bravo.  Really?  Bravo.  I got a bravo and applause today. 
[00:00:30]  Why?  I don't know.  Do you want to stumble?  Apparently, he's...  I didn't fall face first out of the elevator.  He follows you on Twitter.  I can't believe you made it.  Yeah.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Yeah, that was pretty good.  I felt like a celebrity or something.  Well, I feel like we should talk about the Olympics right off the bat.  Oh, the Olympics.  This shit is going down.  Hell, yeah.  I kind of like it, I think.  I, um...  You know, everyone can be jaded and cynical, which I am part of myself. 
[00:01:00]  Well, well...  And I just started watching it just for goofy tweet purposes.  Yeah, you want to make your jokes, but I kind of like...  Tweet fodder.  Yeah, it's absolutely tweet fodder.  Yeah.  But, um...  I started like...  I started like, oh, I'm getting into some of these things.  Really?  I say some.  Oh!  I say some.  I think I just gave myself hiccup.  Oh, boy.  That's the worst.  Ah!  I don't even know where to begin.  The opening ceremonies were... 
[00:01:30]  Ugh!  Those I missed.  Didn't they not show them?  Or were they not streaming?  Ah, they showed everything but some kind of tribute to their terrorist victims or something.  I don't know.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Their 9-11 is 7-7 or something like that.  Does anyone know this shit?  7-7, yeah.  And America decided, ah, that's not important for us, so they kind of cut that out of the  opening ceremonies.  Ah!  When the bus got blown up a while back.  Oh, okay.  A few years ago?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right, right.  Can you imagine if the rest of the world cut off our 9-11 ceremonies?  Yeah, we don't care. 
[00:02:00]  We would be pissed.  Ah!  But we're like, ah, whatever.  That happened to you guys, not us.  Yeah, that was your shit.  I think that's what happened.  Yeah.  And then what?  The Queen came parachuting in or something?  Yes, the Queen and...  And then sat there with that fucking face of hers?  That face.  Her and my good friend, Daniel Craig.  I've been following this Queen for a long time.  What does it take to make this stupid bitch smile?  The Olympics is pretty much for her. 
[00:02:30]  If he gets the soda taken away, that will...  I know your Bloomberg Queen joke.  That's a good one.  Soda.  Wait till you hear about him and the dumb breast milk.  We'll do that a little later.  Yeah, yeah.  No, the opening ceremonies was pretty much for her.  She's sitting there, and they got all this shit going on.  Fireworks, pomp and circumstance.  A lot of pomp and circumstance.  Circumstance, and she just sits there with that scowl.  Yeah.  She's the Queen. 
[00:03:00]  That's how she's always been.  She's not allowed to smile?  What's the deal?  No.  She can't smile.  Ever.  She's got to look grumpy.  I remember when Princess Di died, and they did that whole thing, and the whole fucking  country was in tears.  She sat there stoically.  She really isn't a fucking ice queen.  She stinks.  She must be the rock for England.  Is that what that is?  Yes.  She's stupid.  That must be very powerful.  I have noticed, though, and I tweeted it last night also, that England has been around 
[00:03:30]  for a long enough period of time in the world.  To fix their teeth?  No.  That old jag?  No.  Because the teeth are still horrendous.  To have some really silly traditions.  Right.  And they've been highlighting some of these on those little moments that they produce pieces.  The Bob Costas moment?  Yes, the Bob Costas.  Everything has to be over the top.  Of course, Mary Carrillo also.  Mary Carrillo, let's spend some time with the swimmers and talk about how they did such 
[00:04:00]  a great job at the diving competition.  She is another one that I couldn't watch her with that goddamn, her dentures.  Yeah.  She's trying to fight them like Spock.  Why don't you just get some good glue?  I don't know what's happening in there.  Push those things in there.  She has a voice like a man, and she's trying to keep her teeth in her head as she's interviewing  these young Olympians. 
[00:04:30]  It is so fucking good.  Get audio of her, please.  Yes.  We need audio.  Yes, get audio of Mary Carrillo.  I didn't realize there was a drop-off of her.  Sis, sis, you performed so well in the synchronized diving competitions.  Tell us how you felt when you came up from the water.  Oh, it's horrid.  We both noticed the fat fucking... 
[00:05:00]  The fat diver?  The synchronized fat diver.  Oh, did I start getting shit from all those fucking...  So was I.  What the fuck?  You're an Olympian, and the only ones that should be fat and out of shape are the ones  that shoot.  Everyone else should have fucking solid bodies.  Yeah.  Especially the divers.  I thought she was three months pregnant, and I think you just tweeted, holy shit, of course  America has a fat diver.  Yeah, that figure is USA has fat diver.  She was a lumpy...  Just a lump of shit. 
[00:05:30]  And they show, like, when she dives, and her legs are straight up in the air with her  little partner diver, because they do the synchronized diving.  Yeah.  Like, the other girl's legs were slender.  She's like a swimmer's body kind of a thing.  Yes.  And she's just this big, fat, trunky legs.  It was horrible.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't they just have twins in that competition?  That would be great, right?  Wouldn't that check the judges?  If you have twin daughters at this point, just start them in the synchronized diving  thing.  Throw them in that synchronized diving shit.  You'll be fucking gold.  Literally.  Because if the bodies are similar, it makes it tougher to figure out what the fuck's going 
[00:06:00]  on there if you're a judge.  Exactly.  But if you see a kind of a chubby one and a slender one, it makes you think they're not  doing it together.  Even if they are, they don't look like they are.  But what do I know?  Because I think we won a medal anyway.  Yeah, it was great watching fucking Abbott and Costello jump off the fucking diving  board.  She was fucking fat.  She was a little chunky, that one.  I'm like, wow, she's in her first trimester.  Good for her.  Yeah.  That's not getting in the way of the Olympics. 
[00:06:30]  See, right there, all the way to the right.  Yeah, that's...  Oh, anyway, the queen, I guess, parachuted in, and now it's a big deal, because they  found the guy that actually did that for the queen.  Yes.  One of those produced pieces.  And they show the produced pieces of, like, around the palace, how some fucking guy gives  the little tour and gives you info, and he's got to be 20 years in the military service  there, and all he's doing is blurting out little things like a carnival barker.  Did you see the one where the guy's in training for the next year or so, just so he can be 
[00:07:00]  one of those guys?  That's the guy you're talking about?  Yeah, the guy's just got to fucking go around, and he has to know everything.  When everything closes down, that's when he practices, when no one's around, and he  has a coach with a fucking clipboard.  You saw that piece?  And he's just yelling about, like, the fucking, the Tower of London.  And then the guy goes, well, you missed this and this and this.  Oh, he's practicing his tour guide speech?  Yeah.  Forever.  For over a year, he's got to do it by himself.  Because he's got to know everything.  And, like, the prerequisite is you must spend, I think, a decade in the military. 
[00:07:30]  Well, that's probably before they want to give you that kind of access, right?  Not only access, but it's more a traditional thing.  It's not so much access, it's that you're, it's an honor.  It's complete bullshit, is what you're trying to say.  Obviously, the guy knows the job well enough to do it now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But they're forcing him, I don't know, the training is over a year.  It's England.  And, you know, when they close down, then he comes out and he does it for nobody, except for his coach, who's been doing it for 12 years.  God, I'm watching the Olympics way too much. 
[00:08:00]  I've been right there, too.  All right.  Well, here's Mary Carrillo.  Do you want to listen to this?  Let's hear Mary Carrillo's stenchers.  His voice.  First of all, how does London feel?  That's pretty deep, right?  Oh, wait.  I love this city.  I've been here.  I've had the good luck to be here many, many times.  Just the way this city has come together, the stadia they've built, the surrounding iconic buildings and monuments around.  I'm inspired already.  I love it.  I think they're going to have a great game, Sierra. 
[00:08:30]  Great game, Sierra.  You think she's trying to keep her dentures?  Oh, she's there.  They want to fly out of her teeth, out of her mouth.  I just think what's so funny about that is just how humiliating that impression is for her.  Like, that's something she probably so thinks that no one notices.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I wasn't looking up at the TV at one point, and she was talking at the end of the game,  sort of a wrap-up thing, and I swear I thought it was one of the guys, like a commentator.  And I look up, and there she is.  We'll be back tomorrow with more of the Olympics. 
[00:09:00]  She's terrible.  You're watching the gymnastics?  Of course.  Now, it's easy for everyone to go, oh, wow, look at these hot women.  They're not hot women.  I've got to bust everyone's bubble.  They're fidgets.  When they give their stats, she's 4'7", 85 pounds.  Tallest of her team.  Right.  They're midgets.  They are little fidgets.  They have to be.  I think officially, if you're under 5' tall, I think you're considered a little person. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  They are weird-looking.  It's the little pixie thing that people find them adorable.  I don't know, man.  And then you see when they grow up, and they just look freakish.  They look freakish.  I like that bitchy Michaela-looking face girl.  Oh, the mean girl?  Yeah, yeah.  She looks like she's mean.  That's cool.  I also like the 24-year-old from Romania, who definitely looks like she doesn't belong out there.  Right.  She's got tits and a nice fucking ass on her and everything. 
[00:10:00]  Like a real ass.  She's the only woman in the women's fucking gymnastics.  All the other ones are fucking, like, they look like they're in elementary school.  She's having a tough time on the balance beam because all her sexual organs are-  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Are distributing her weight awkwardly.  Her weight differently.  Right.  She actually has ovaries.  Right.  I don't know what they're doing to these.  Yeah, she can't do the fucking split on the balance beam.  She can't do the split because she's on her period.  Right.  She doesn't want to fucking crush her ovaries.  That's exactly it. 
[00:10:30]  She's a-  I know that's not possible.  She looks pretty goddamn good out there, though.  She's pretty hot.  Yeah.  She might actually be of a height that you could handle.  Romania.  Wow, look at that picture.  Yeah, dude.  Damn it.  I swear she-  Oh, my God.  How old is she?  Dude, she's sexy.  24.  Oh, she's pretty.  She's pretty fucking hot.  How tall is she, though?  She was taller than a lot of the other girls.  I don't know, relative to the other girls.  Is she five foot at least?  I don't know.  You can't go under five foot ever.  No?  No.  Spinner, they call him.  Yeah, but five foot is, you know- 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, under five foot's gross.  Under five foot is just creepy.  Yeah, there's just something wrong with it.  Yes.  Yeah.  You could be in a movie doing something.  You should be traipsing.  Five-three?  There you go.  Five-three.  This chick is hot there.  Yeah, yeah.  She's officially hot.  She definitely is.  And then the Russian girls, I noticed.  There's one Russian girl.  They had a close-up of her face right before she goes on.  You know that intent look?  Yeah.  And she's staring.  And I absolutely thought I had changed the channel to the Special Olympics.  She fucking, I swear, dude, she looked like there was that extra, extra soul. 
[00:11:30]  Just a little off?  There was a plus one on the soul.  Oh my God, look at this.  And she doesn't even have big shoulders like the rest of them.  Oh, she looked great out there, this fucking 24-year-old Romanian girl.  She probably has, though, like, little stubble everywhere.  Like, when you, like, she probably has, because she's so Romanian.  Like, when you kiss her, there's probably the remnants of what was once, like, mustache  hair that she shaved off.  Yeah.  There's something that will wreck that.  We're all looking at these Olympics for hotness, right? 
[00:12:00]  And then I liked the other Russian chick.  Gymnast?  Alia.  Was her name?  Alia?  Yeah, I kind of liked her.  Russian gymnast.  Maybe.  I don't know.  Maybe that's her.  Yeah, that's got to be her, right?  Alina?  Alina.  That's her.  Right?  She looks pretty cute.  I don't know.  No, I mean, cute in the face or something.  I don't know.  I'm not sure if that's her.  That's kind of hot. 
[00:12:30]  Legs over her fucking head.  I love a girl who can do that.  Her pussy is literally behind her head.  Yeah.  Well, let me tell you something about pussy.  That's pretty fucked up.  That fucking Gabby.  That Gabby on our team, the black chick?  The black broad.  She got something in her fucking pants there, in her leotard.  Really?  It's fucking sticking out like a ball-less dick.  Let me see.  She has ball-less cock.  Let me see.  Like her ball bag was blown up by a firecracker?  Gabby.  Let me see. 
[00:13:00]  Gabby.  Putting Gabby's bulge.  Sammy, let me see.  There you go.  You got it.  Sam's working on it.  Sam.  Image that shit.  Let me see.  There's Gabby.  Come on.  Get that up.  Gabby's pussy.  Do you need her to show a little split?  A little split.  A little split.  She's trappy.  How old is she, first of all?  She's standing there.  They're all 17.  They're hiding it.  17.  Something like that.  They're hiding it right there.  You got to be 16 or something like that in the Olympics?  I think you can be 15 if you're going to turn 16 during the Olympics. 
[00:13:30]  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  So it's very rare that you get a 15-year-old in there.  I heard that last night, too.  I heard that, too.  Oh, my God.  Little tidbits that I just remember.  That we're picking up?  Yes.  How old was Nadia Comaneci?  45.  She was 10 years old.  Oh, I went to the other one.  I thought she was old.  Sorry.  Sam, is that it?  I want to see.  Is that it?  Yeah, look, look.  You can kind of see the bulge there.  There's something going on there.  Turn to me.  I can't see her.  She just had a giant bulge in her pants.  Well, the problem is, though, she's really tiny, too.  She might be 4'5".  Oh, yeah. 
[00:14:00]  How tall is she?  How tall is Gabby on the U.S. team?  And what happened with the U.S. team?  Well.  There's some huge controversy today.  Yes.  Because of this whole culture of, you know, everyone's got to do well and everyone's got to have a  chance.  Inclusion.  Oh, make sure everyone's included.  Has actually hit the Olympics.  Because I was starting to think, oh, it's nice to see where people actually win at a sport.  Yeah.  Well, when you send a team in, apparently, it seems here's what happens.  You get to represent your team in the singles. 
[00:14:30]  You know, when the girls just go out there alone, it's not a team thing.  Right.  It's just for them.  That's like the big event for gymnastics.  And in order to do that, you've got to qualify by being the best, you know?  One of the best.  One of the best.  One of the top eight or whatever.  I think there's 24.  Okay.  There's 24 from all the teams that go into this singles competition.  And what happens is you're only allowed two players, two people per team now. 
[00:15:00]  When do they change that rule?  This Olympics.  It's not that inclusion shit.  You used to be the best score.  So you could have four people from, you know, one team.  From one country.  Of course.  And then maybe no people from some other country.  That's fucked up.  But now it's like two people per team.  So everybody gets a chance.  You know what that's about?  Yeah.  Getting ratings.  Probably.  Because then, you know, if you...  Around the world.  Because if I see an event and there's not an American in it, I'm gone. 
[00:15:30]  I'm somewhere else.  So that's probably why they do that shit.  Well, it wound up costing the Americans now that the number one gymnast is out of it.  She got edged out by a teammate last night because of this new rule.  She would have been in.  She was better than other gymnasts that qualified.  From other countries.  That's horrible.  Yeah, they don't do that.  If you got eight really good fucking gymnasts, then so be it.  Right.  It should be the top 24. 
[00:16:00]  The top 24 score-wise.  Not the top 24 based on two from each country.  The top.  Oh, my God.  That's horrible.  Yeah.  Why do they think that was a good rule?  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's probably to keep viewers.  Well, that's on Natalia.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I said that.  Definitely.  That's not fair, though.  No, it's not at all.  That's not fair.  That's exactly why they're doing it.  You're not being fair.  That's not fair to the athletes that work, you know, their whole lives to get to this point.  And then they don't get to be in the actual finals because they already have two members  from their team in it? 
[00:16:30]  These gymnasts have had a hard enough time keeping that body the way it is for as long  as they have.  Four more years?  It doesn't happen.  No.  They start sprouting.  Has it always been that way?  No.  Or is it new?  There's a new rule.  There's a new rule.  That's why it's horrible.  Oh, God.  You'll be hearing about this all day today.  It's a horrible, horrible thing that happened.  Yeah, see, they just showed it.  Medal favorites shut out.  So why did they do, what's the Olympic committee, besides the fact the Olympics pretty much  stinking, we got it.  I think it's this inclusion thing.  They just want all these countries that never get represented. 
[00:17:00]  Fucking bad.  They want worldwide ratings.  Because it's always the United States and Romania is always in it.  Russia.  Russia.  And then you get these other countries that just stink at it.  And are they going to do it with the other sports that we suck at?  I don't think so.  It's just the gymnastics?  I guess they're going to see how this works.  Well, it's fucked up because the gymnastics always does incredibly well in the Olympics  to begin with.  Yeah, yeah.  Why fuck with it?  Oh, God.  That is the dumbest thing.  People should just not watch it.  If people stopped watching it, they wouldn't do it.  Well, that ain't happening anytime soon. 
[00:17:30]  No, that ain't going to fucking happen.  No way.  That is horrible.  No way.  Wow.  I was tagging some of my shit with, you know, hashtag Olympics.  And I realized when I do that that other people that might not know my sense of humor  or my sense of sarcasm get to read it.  So I was getting some, you know, I was getting some flack back from some people that I was  being asinine about things.  I love when you get one of those from someone that absolutely has no clue who you are.  I don't know why you have so many followers, but you're an asshole. 
[00:18:00]  Some fucking dumb Canadian called me a douche.  He goes, ha, ha, ha.  Funny.  Not really.  Right.  I was like, oh, he got me.  Oh, wow.  I thought it was funny.  I just commented on how perhaps the women's, the Chinese women's gymnastic team was spending  the off hours putting together our iPods.  That's funny.  That's funny.  Who wouldn't enjoy that?  They look like, they certainly look like that's what they should be doing. 
[00:18:30]  Of course they won.  Of course they won the synchronized diving.  Do we even have a shot against the Chinese?  What are you kidding me?  Yeah.  Yes.  Let's see that.  They're really good at synchronizing.  Holy fuck.  Well, it's, you know, they probably read each other's minds.  I believe they've been cloning for a really long time.  Yeah, Pat from Monaki had a funny one talking about the synchronized diving, the Asian girls  there.  Yeah, what did he say?  Saying they looked like, that he had seen them before riding on Mothra's back. 
[00:19:00]  Those two twins that used to fucking run Mothra.  Monaki.  And that water polo?  Oh, man.  That looks fucking exhausting.  I tweeted that I was tired just watching the damn thing.  I couldn't get past the fucking dumb hats enough to watch the actual sport.  They're wearing those fucking hats with the bottom thing that ties in a bow like Laura  Ingalls' bonnet.  Yeah.  I wanted, I was like, why don't they use a clip?  Yeah.  Or Velcro or something.  They got these dumb little bows at the bottom. 
[00:19:30]  And why even have them?  But it turns out, I guess they got to protect their ears.  You don't want to take a ball to the side of your head, I guess.  Protect their ears.  I went with a mumps joke myself.  It was a good one.  The mumps, yeah, it did look like a mumps hat.  Then I realized most people don't even know what the fuck old school mumps shit.  Do you know how many times I do references on stage to the fucking mumps and people don't  get it?  Why don't they get it?  I don't know.  And it's before our time, but you just.  Maybe you should go with a diphtheria joke. 
[00:20:00]  But no, it really, the mumps jokes are on their way out quickly.  Yes.  I know.  I'm starting to think that, too.  But I mean, with the Google, you could Google image mumps and then you would get the joke.  No one likes Googling jokes.  Yeah, true.  Joke punchlines.  True.  I can't believe no one knows what the mumps is.  Whenever that bombs, I'm shocked.  I love going with mumps jokes.  Dude, I could live on mumps jokes alone.  Back with old cartoons and old TV shows, when somebody was make-believing they were sick,  they would always put the mump wraps on their head and a little thermometer and an ice bag. 
[00:20:30]  Mumps.  And that's before our time, too.  I don't know.  It's been a joke and a punchline forever.  I did have the mumps when I was a kid.  Did you really?  I had the mumps.  Cool.  What's wrong with you?  Well, I got the mumps.  How old are you?  I didn't have polio.  Well, you had the mumps.  Did you have to wear that thing?  No.  What happens when you get the mumps?  I don't know.  Your glands, like, get swollen under your neck.  Isn't that just swollen glands?  Yeah, yeah.  You get, like, mumps.  What a mumpy douche.  Why does your swollen glands turn into the mumps? 
[00:21:00]  I don't know.  Anthony had the mumps during the Great Depression.  No, I didn't.  I wasn't alive in the 30s.  Wow, the mumps.  Yeah, mumps rap jokes fucking really good.  God damn it.  And I live for them.  I don't know mumps jokes.  I could fucking, I could just do nothing but mumps.  And then I Google imaged it myself and went, oh, fuck, they don't even show the old school  raps for the mumps anymore.  Yeah, apparently E-Rock had them at one point.  He still does.  The mumps that won't go away.  Oh, has that kid got the mumps?  You can see, look, the little double chin. 
[00:21:30]  Poor mumpy boy.  Look at how mumpy that kid is.  But they don't wrap his head anymore.  No.  You got to go three or four pages in and then you get to see old school mumps raps.  What did the mump raps do?  I had ice in them or something.  Ow.  I don't know.  There you go.  There's one.  There you go.  There's one.  See, that's...  Aw, the poor little kid's got the mumps.  My water polo line should have killed.  Look.  All you had to do is go to page four of the mumps Google images to get my joke.  Googling jokes. 
[00:22:00]  Fucking, you know what?  I'm not giving up.  No, you can't give up on the mumps rap.  All right.  Aw, poor little kid.  But they look exhausting in the water.  Yeah.  And then I was telling you before the show, before the water polo match, these guys jump  in the pool and they start warming up by swimming.  I'm like, why won't you save your energy for the game?  Yeah.  You can't touch the bottom.  And does the goalie have to sit there or does he get to stand on something when the ball's  in the other end?  Is he constantly just...  I don't know.  Do you know?  Like staying in the net?  I would assume they would have some platform maybe in the goal where you could just hang out 
[00:22:30]  there until it's time to perform.  I don't know.  Why make him fucking stay in the water the whole time?  Well, everybody else has to, right?  Wait, you can't touch the bottom?  No.  Why?  Watch water polo.  It is exhausting.  How long did I...  What is it?  I'm sorry to the people that play this sport out there.  There's no skills involved.  Well, please it.  I've never known anyone my entire life.  What do you use with water polo?  It's like you're pretty much using like a volleyball more or less.  And you look, look at this.  You're in a pool and you've got to throw it into the net.  And you're over your head.  And look, they just throw the ball around and try to get high enough where they can maybe 
[00:23:00]  take a shot.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  They've got to kind of jump out of the water like a porpoise.  They're trying to throw it in the big net.  And they say, oh, wow, he's the best at that.  Why is that a fucking...  Chess should be an Olympic sport.  And it's not.  Why would anybody want to watch fucking water polo?  Who would want to watch chess?  How about they got rid of baseball?  I love you.  They got rid of baseball and softball.  But we have water polo.  We got ping pong.  And we got badminton.  Why is baseball gone? 
[00:23:30]  I don't know.  Well, yeah.  Maybe because we were so damn good.  Maybe because no one else...  I really don't know.  Why is basketball there then?  Because, God damn, isn't our basketball team just wiping up?  Well, yeah.  We're going to do all right.  It's like a professional fucking team.  And the rest of them are just like, meh.  Hey, the rest of the world fucked us for years.  We were doing our amateurs and they were using pros.  And we finally said enough.  And I like basketball, obviously.  I can't watch that shit.  Olympic basketball.  No, because it's like...  I mean, the game they played yesterday, I did watch for a while against the French. 
[00:24:00]  And blew them out.  But, you know, first half was kind of close.  And then they blew them out in the second half.  Oh, LeBron's in it.  Is Kobe playing?  Yeah.  Yeah, they got them all, man.  Yeah, they got all the all-stars.  Stupid Carmelo Anthony.  So the world could see my frustration at how lame this guy is with his 18-foot fade-away  fucking jump shots.  His ball hogging.  His ball hogging won't affect the team, though.  They're that damn good. 
[00:24:30]  But I'm trying to see if the goalie is...  No, the goalie looks like they're treading water, man.  Yeah, the whole time, really.  Like everyone else.  No, I know when the game's going on there.  But I was wondering if he could hold on to something when the ball's on the other end.  I bet they hold on to the net.  You think?  Maybe the top of the net.  Maybe that's illegal, though, or something.  That's probably illegal.  Otherwise, you would just hang on the net and kick the fucking ball on its throne.  And you can't see any of the action because they're just splashing.  Yeah.  A lot of splashing.  I mean, most of their bodies are under the water. 
[00:25:00]  It's just...  What, are they going to protect their ears from that ball, you mean?  Or all the...  Yeah, of course.  Because they do throw the ball pretty damn hard.  I guess if you took one of those to the ear, it could really fuck you up.  If it's wet and hits your ear, it seals everything, you'd probably blow an eardrum out.  That's what I'm thinking.  Oh, man.  So they've got to wear the mumps wrap.  You get it?  Boo.  What does that mean?  The mumps wrap prevented them from dropping to your chest?  What does that mean?  Like your glands would fall down all the way to your chest?  Wait a minute.  I've got to go to Woody. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, that's terrible.  Woody, what are you talking about?  Man, that was an expression they used to use in relation to the mumps.  They would say the mumps would drop, and that just meant that it went from your glands  and your neck to your testicles and sterilized you.  And supposedly the wrap would keep that from happening, but I think that's some of that past  medicinal bullshit that...  It's obvious nonsense, Woody.  Well, I think if you get the mumps after puberty, you do have a chance of being sterile.  I think it can sterilize you.  I'd love to get them. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, man.  Right?  Never pull out again.  Oh, great.  For the first time anyway.  All right.  Let me go to Angelo in New York City.  Angelo.  Listen, Carmelo's not that bad.  He is horrendous as far as a team player goes.  He's got great skill.  He's a great basketball player individually, but he's horrendous when it comes to team basketball.  And Angelo, I'll do this right here and right now, and I'll even fucking get your info. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, the Knicks will never win a championship with Carmelo Anthony.  I will give you $1,000 cash if it happens.  It's not happening.  You're getting how crazy this guy's getting here.  Come on.  I'm telling you, they're going to be pretty good the next few years.  I'd have recorded that bet part, though.  I think they're going to be great, man.  They're never going to win a championship.  He's a fucking ball hog.  You're in the minority, man.  Most Knicks fans are like, Jesus, enough with this guy already.  I'd like to bang his wife, though.  She's got some ass.  Yeah, we've seen her live, by the way.  She does have a really nice ass. 
[00:27:00]  He's married to Lala.  Lala?  The Lala brud.  She comes in here every once in a while.  But, Angelo, I mean, you're right.  He's got the skills.  I would never deny that.  But he fucking holds on to the ball too long.  I think the best thing that happened to the team this year is Lynn going.  And I think it's going to be, you're going to see Jason Kidd.  This other dude from Argentina is going to be passing the ball.  I think we're going to be great, dude.  Yeah, he's 100.  He's 100.  I like that he still goes out and drinks.  I like that.  Well, yeah. 
[00:27:30]  And crashes his car.  I'll be doing, I'm going to watch the Knicks.  I'll be in for a little while.  But that Anthony fucking frustrates the shit out of me.  Carmelo.  Carmelo.  There we go.  There's Lala.  It's a nice fucking thumper.  Yeah, man.  She's all right.  Lala's a dumper.  Yeah.  Lala has a fucking wonderful rump.  This guy.  With all the tats on it.  This guy, Tom in New Orleans, can't believe you're complaining about water polo and there's  gymnastics.  We did our whole gymnastics.  We're talking about gymnastics already, you motherfucker.  I don't know how the fuck they do that. 
[00:28:00]  Do you see that vaulting shit?  The vaulting shit.  They run full speed and then get on their hands to start the vault?  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  Put up that Michaela fucking, what's her name?  They say she's the best in the world by far, right?  Yeah.  Is she the mean girl?  She on that stupid vault.  She was amazing.  She's the mean girl, right?  Yeah.  Is she in the U.S.?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  He's having trouble spelling Michaela.  Yeah.  Just give it a whirl.  It'll come up.  Let the fucking...  Oh, you had it.  If you owned a Kayla, how would you spell it? 
[00:28:30]  Dope.  You kind of had it when you looked down.  You kind of had it.  It gave you a couple options.  Oh, man.  It gave you a couple really good options.  Michaela.  He's spelling like fucking restaurants.  You're terrible at this, Sam.  Sam doesn't like being bad at stuff.  Yes, and he's bad at most things.  Michaela.  Yeah, she's got a broken toe or a hurt toe, and she just wrapped it.  Oh, yeah.  There she is.  Look.  See?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She knows how to photograph.  How old is she?  She's cute, man.  Yeah, but I'm telling you, she's a pipsqueak, though. 
[00:29:00]  They're weird looking.  Well, they're all pipsqueaks.  She's got a really nice face, though.  Yeah.  She's the cute one out of the bunch, because the other ones, meh.  Then you can tell she's...  Meh.  She's...  Look at the empty stadiums, man.  Is that at the Olympics?  I think...  No, that's got to be a practice.  That's terrible.  That doesn't look like her uniform.  Oh, that must have been some kind of practice.  But, I mean, they have a lot of empty seats, because the corporations, you know, get all  these seats.  Man!  And then, for some reason, they're not handing it out to their people, or they're handing 
[00:29:30]  it out to people that have no intention of going to the events.  It's terrible.  It's terrible.  So, the Olympics are saying, hey, either use your tickets or give them back.  We don't want empty fucking arenas when these people are performing.  Jeez.  Look at that.  Isn't that unbelievable?  Yeah, it annoys me.  It's like, you know, so many people would love to...  I think the Olympics stink, but so many people love them and want to go to them.  The locals are frustrated, because they want tickets.  And they've been sold out for a long time, so they've been told.  And then you watch the coverage on TV, and you see all these empty seats, because of  the corporate douches. 
[00:30:00]  Douchey corporations probably get fucking 500 tickets per event.  Like, what could they possibly be doing with the tickets?  But the Olympics have to figure out a better system.  They know this is going on now, so they should have some kind of standby line or something.  You put them at will call.  If people don't show up a half hour or 45 minutes before the game, every ticket is available  to be sold.  Something.  Yeah.  Because, I mean, there's a lot of empty seats.  Yeah, they dropped softball and baseball. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, we said that.  And then they got all these other weird sports in there.  Really just strange ones.  Not as strange as they used to do, but we did that bit as well.  Yeah.  All the old...  We should do it.  It's been a few years.  All the fucking events they used to have, they don't do anymore.  Yeah, that's right.  That's some strange ones.  Yeah, they did have weird ones.  Woman punching.  They took that one out.  They had one where...  Negro juggling.  Can't do that anymore.  They had one where all you had to do was see how far you could go down in the water. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, how deep you can go.  Yeah, yeah.  Natalie Wooding.  Which became an extremely dangerous sport.  Yeah.  Man.  Yeah, there's a list somewhere.  If someone could help us out with a link, that would be nice.  Then, also, I noticed from one of your retweets that Samuel L. Jackson...  Samuel L. Jackson...  Holy fuck, dude.  Now, it's his fucking Twitter account.  Yeah, because he has over a million fucking followers.  Yep.  It's verified.  And he's hilarious. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, let me try to find that.  I got a...  Yeah, my buddy SNM Network.  He's a friend of mine.  I know who it is, actually.  It's Howard Cosell's nephew.  Oh, that guy, right.  He's been on the show a few times.  He's now on Twitter.  And he's doing a pretty cool little internet show based on Twitter feeds.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So you can send your tweets to this guy.  And he builds sort of like what Joel McHale does, but in his own style.  And it focuses on tweets and current events. 
[00:32:00]  It's pretty good.  Follow him.  SNM Network.  Anyway, he told me that Samuel L. Jackson is live-tweeting the Olympics, so I clicked  on it, and he's got some great tweets, man.  You got it over there?  Read some of them, Sam.  I am.  He can't find them.  He's got Samuel Adams up.  Oh, my God.  I'm trying to find...  Wow, it seems like some were erased. 
[00:32:30]  No way.  Did someone hack it?  I don't know, man.  All those...  Because he had some motherfuckers in there and...  Oh, wait.  It might be all the way back here.  Hold on.  You got it, Sam?  Yeah.  Yeah, read some of the better ones.  Dope-ass start for the women gymnasts.  Feeling good about our chances.  These judgment sports are sketchy at best.  Sketchy at best.  Fuck.  Another short pool loss. 
[00:33:00]  Let's see.  Yeah, the butter-fucking-fly world record.  Dang.  Butter-fucking-fly world record.  Damn.  Yeah.  70-fucking-2?  Really?  And that Canadian dive was all fucked up.  It's like...  Yeah, you just...  You read them with Samuel L. Jackson's voice.  Oh, yeah, you have to.  And what is he doing?  I don't know, but he's having a good time.  Americans getting boned on sink diving scores. 
[00:33:30]  What is he saying about water polo?  It's the second one down there.  All the way down.  Further down, right.  Water polo.  As dope as always.  Speed, toughness, durability.  Strong swimmer fucker.  Strong swimmer fucker.  It almost looked like somebody had his account and was pulling a Samuel L. Jackson.  Well, that's what I thought.  And then you see the amount of followers and you got to think it's got to be him, man. 
[00:34:00]  Good for him.  Told y'all ladies weightlifting drama, little baby's picking up heavy shit.  Yeah, it's pretty entertaining.  It is a fun thing to tweet with, the Olympics, you know?  Like you said, it's fodder, you know?  It's fodder.  Tweet fodder.  I enjoy watching him and I enjoy trying to make fun of him.  Bob Costas sucks.  He doesn't suck, but everything has to be over the top dramatic with this idiot.  Dramatic. 
[00:34:30]  With those stupid pre-done packages.  London.  Here we are.  They show like fucking Big Ben.  Those video packages.  We don't need it for every single fucking person.  Yeah.  I didn't realize France's national anthem had the beginning of All You Need Is Love on  too.  That's pretty funny.  That was like, yeah. 
[00:35:00]  I thought the Beatles came up with that.  I'm like, oh, they're playing some Beatles.  And I was like, oh, no.  Wait.  This is how the, this is the French national anthem.  I know.  No, that's the Beatles.  And then it changes to the Beatles.  No, that's the Beatles, though.  But the actual French national anthem starts like that.  I don't believe you.  Wait.  Yeah.  No.  Yes.  They just threw the beginning of the French national anthem in front of their song. 
[00:35:30]  Oh.  Yeah.  It wasn't that way.  It was backwards.  The Beatles decided to do that.  Did you guys see the wiggling ass sprinter?  We showed the other one.  Yeah, yeah.  No, the other one from behind.  Oh, another one?  Her ass was wiggling too.  Sam, can you find that maybe?  Not the Australian girl?  No, there's another one in a red, a little red number.  She didn't make it, the Australian girl.  No, I like her little dance.  I loved her too. 
[00:36:00]  She had a fat nose that we pointed out at her.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Nice wiggling fucking shitter, though.  There's another.  There's another wiggler.  And she's.  Shitter.  It's from behind.  Oh.  It's from behind.  She's getting ready to sprint.  She was dancing down the aisle.  They should have like glass bottoms on the fucking tracks and they should have a cunt cam.  Do you know how outraged people would be the first time NBC went to the cunt cam?  It just follows them around the track.  Yeah, on the bottom.  Yeah, underneath on a track. 
[00:36:30]  Like just how, how many, how long would that make it before the outrage overtook?  Oh my God.  Sam, put.  You wouldn't finish the race.  Put Wiggles' ass instead of hips.  I did a minute.  Nothing, huh?  First and last search.  Yeah, this one, um, that one's going viral as well.  I think it's Zara, Z-A-R-A.  See, people know, yeah.  Zara Dempsey, maybe?  That's what Fishman's saying.  Zara.  Zara Dempsey.  There you go.  Dampney?  Dampney.  It's gotta be Zara Dampney, maybe.  I should write a fucking song about her. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, Zara.  D.  Now go with the videos.  Let's see.  I'll know it.  Keep going down.  Where is this young lady?  This intriguing young lady.  Keep going.  Wow.  Where is this young seductress?  What do we got here?  This young Kristen Stewart-like seductress.  I'm just kind of a sprinter.  No, then that's not her, man.  Someone give me that fucking link, please.  Where's the link?  The swimming isn't very exciting, but it's really amazing to watch these guys. 
[00:37:30]  Because they fucking swim fast.  Dude, I can't swim like that.  I get water on my nose.  I would smash my skull if I tried to spit upside that one.  Yeah.  What?  It's more than just getting water up your nose.  That's the reason you're not an Olympics player.  No, but I can't.  I can't do that because I get water up my nose.  Dude, I can't even do it casually in the pool to exercise.  I don't know.  I don't know how to make myself swim like that.  I don't know how they do it because they open their mouth and they're just...  I don't know how they do that shit.  I would panic and have a fucking panic attack two strokes. 
[00:38:00]  Do you know how much water you would take in?  All of it.  If you look at their bodies, they leave like a wake.  Right.  Like a boat.  They're fucking moving so fast.  The water goes over their back and it leaves like a ditch next to them like a motorboat  would.  And then over their legs, it comes back out like a rooster tail.  Yeah.  It's fucking amazing to watch how fast these guys...  Are their feet kicking?  Because my feet go like this.  Oh.  Dot, dot, dot, dot.  Like I'm marching in the water to keep me floating.  They are so smooth.  You watch their bodies.  There's no unnecessary movement happening whatsoever. 
[00:38:30]  And then the underwater cam, when they do the turn and they fly...  It's amazing.  They start the turn well off the wall with just enough room left where they know they'll  kick off the wall but not waste any space by getting a little too close to the wall.  We've all tried the Olympic turn in the pool.  Oh, the Olympic turn in the pool.  Water in my ear.  I come on...  Ah!  You just look like a blubbery mess.  Yeah.  But that's why they have that line.  You reach it for the wall with your toes.  You're not close enough.  No. 
[00:39:00]  Isn't that why they have the lines at the bottom?  Yeah, there's like a line.  I'm sure.  They still have to know, yeah.  A T-square so they know where...  So they know where to start their turn.  The turn, I think.  Yeah, it's a visual aid.  Otherwise, you'd have no idea.  I know.  How would they know?  Unless the coach was yelling, turn!  Yeah.  They do the turn.  And then they don't start like swimming crazy.  Like right after the turn, they kind of let that momentum from kicking off the wall carry  them.  Right.  And they do that weird, like fishy kind of...  That's pretty amazing.  ...doing the worm move underwater and then they start swimming like maniacs. 
[00:39:30]  And then the backstroke, it's like a paddle boat.  It's amazing.  They're just going with their arms.  I was quite amazed at the athleticism of us.  I'm not finding any athletes.  I want to see swimming.  Why can't...  Someone's got to...  Give me the link.  She's in a red bottom.  She's a sprinter.  She's getting ready.  She's wiggling her ass.  It's almost as good as the hip wiggle.  See that from last week.  That just looks hard.  Yeah, they're pushing way out of the water.  It's just long pools, too. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, man.  And then they go back and forth like fucking eight times.  Well, depending on the race.  I know.  Yeah.  Olympic pools are motherfuckers.  Jesus Christ.  You see the British broad with the massive nose last night?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Why wouldn't you take care of that?  She's got a fin.  She probably steers with it.  They don't do the spins like this.  They actually go to the wall and kick back for the brush stroke or whatever they're doing,  the butterfly. 
[00:40:30]  And why is their pool water so clear?  I know.  No one's pissing in that, right?  The underwater cams, it almost looks like they're not even in water.  Yeah.  Can you find the over the hand or the breaststroke, Sam?  I want to see some breaststroke.  What's the over the hand breaststroke?  Freestyle swimming or something?  Oh, freestyle.  Yeah, they don't know what to call that.  Yeah.  What do they call it?  We used to call it the crawl.  They call it the handier, ear hand handier.  Ear hand handier.  Oh, boy. 
[00:41:00]  The athlete.  I wish I could swim like that.  I would love to just jump in the pool and fucking take a dip.  Yeah.  Fucking get in shape.  You know?  I'm going to go swimming.  Without floundering.  Dude, I swear my breaststroke, I always keep my head above.  I'm like a fucking dog.  I keep my head above water.  You get all scared to go to the edge of the pool and try to get out?  Yeah, I suck.  I end up dog paddling half the time I'm in the pool.  Yeah, me too.  It's just the worst.  I sit on the steps of my pool with beer.  Yeah.  I don't even go swimming.  You don't do laps?  No. 
[00:41:30]  No.  I just fucking hang on to a floating device.  Oh, well.  I guess we're not going to get the sprinter.  I'll find it during the break.  Yeah, I'm sure we'll find her before the Olympics are over.  It's all about trying to find the hot girls.  Any other big sports people are looking for?  Oh, the beach volleyball.  Oh, yes.  We were watching a little beach volleyball.  Oh, man, our two, they're kind of dog-faced.  Or is that the second team?  I don't know.  Is it the B team?  And then they're wearing a chest.  Here's the wiggle.  Watch this, Jimmy.  I know it's in the red.  We'll put this on our Facebook page.  That's real nice. 
[00:42:00]  She's twitching her ass cheeks.  Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  Look at that deep fucking crack.  We'll have this up there in a minute.  Watch.  Watch her get ready for her sprint.  Oh, she's got a nice ass on her.  All right.  That is nice.  She's wiggling it back and forth, making sure the muscles are all loose.  Who's this camera guy?  Will you move the goddamn thing?  Sam, move the ad out of there.  Sam's leaving the ad.  He's actually looking at the ad.  She already has a wedgie, and she hasn't even begun.  Oh, my God.  She's shaking each ass cheek, getting it ready.  She's down on all floors.  Oh, my God, she's fantastic. 
[00:42:30]  Half her bottom is shoved into the taint area.  Dude, that's so hot.  It's so hot.  Wasn't that nice?  God almighty.  Now the camera guy's got to move back to show the rest of the runners.  No, he doesn't.  Win, win, win, win, win.  Go, go, go, win, go.  Now they're running.  Wow, that's pretty fucking fast.  Yeah.  Look at that perfect hiding.  Here's the one where they have to crash into the wall after they're done.  Bam.  I don't know why they do that, but they do.  I'd like to stand there with a heart on.  Probably don't want to turn an ankle trying to stop.  Yeah.  She seems like she's pretty cute. 
[00:43:00]  I don't know.  That ass on her is pretty nice.  It is.  A wiggling ass.  That'll be on our Facebook page once again.  Yes, Anne.  Watching the beach volleyball, and then the Argentinian girls came out.  Yeah.  And they liked the whole just bikini thing.  And this beach volleyball, the girls, you've got to have the half-long shot.  Yeah.  That's where they look optimum.  Once they zoom in, then you're like, ah, nah.  But the Argentinians had nice asses on them. 
[00:43:30]  Looks like their faces have been hit by a few volleyballs.  But the rest of their bodies are pretty good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then we got, like, I guess we got a man on our team.  There's one really lesbian-looking woman.  Spiky hair and the whole deal.  Yeah, I would kick her out.  She looked like Ethel Mertz.  I think our volleyball players have to be hot.  Yeah, yeah.  Because we're competing with all the other hot female volleyball players.  But then they were wearing too much clothing anyway.  Because it was a little chilly, I guess.  It was a little cold.  That's why.  They'll take that shit off when the weather warms up again. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, perhaps.  But it's fucking, it's England.  It's jolly old England.  It gets cold and rainy there all the time.  What Olympic sport are they allowed to actually have boobs?  Because most of the sports, they don't have boobs.  Sumo wrestling.  Diving, they can't.  Diving, they don't have the boobs.  The swimmers don't have the boobs.  The volleyball players don't have the boobs.  No.  I'm sure rowing, that's impossible.  You've got to get those fucking oars.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Moving around your body, you can't have big fucking hooters on you. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, big heavy tits.  Big fucking hooters.  The oars are bouncing off your fat tits.  You can't oar right because your fucking long nipples are protruding.  You have tumescent nipples.  Yeah, big fucking giant, just giant fucking life-giving tits.  I challenge our audience, who has the biggest tits in the Olympics this time around?  I don't care.  It doesn't have to be the U.S., by the way.  Doesn't matter what sport or what team?  Because they are all flat.  Big meaty areas.  It's really flat.  Most of the stuff you want to do, you want to kind of cut through the fluid that you're 
[00:45:00]  going through.  Air, water, whatever.  Right, right.  So I guess you can't have those big tits.  Yeah.  Well, we remember her.  That's the famous tit monster that freaking had a breast reduction.  Go back one.  Her?  Who is that?  I know that girl.  She's a fucking temper on her.  Yes, I mean, you know, obviously, she's...  Do you know what I just realized as we're talking?  It's been a long time since I've sucked big tits. 
[00:45:30]  E-Roc, get in here.  No, but I just haven't in a while.  I haven't sucked big tits in a long time.  I want to suck a big pair of tits.  Yeah?  For real, yeah.  Well, perhaps you should hang out in better establishments.  Perhaps I should, where they may exist.  Oh, can we get into that after the break?  Jimmy, oh boy.  Did you find your wallet?  That'll be the tease for the next...  I did.  I saw Jimmy tweeting that he lost his wallet.  I was worried for Jimmy.  Wow, those are...  Who's that, Sam? 
[00:46:00]  Serena A.  Oh, that is Serena.  She has great fat tits.  But she's...  She's big, man.  I don't care.  She's a big rump.  She's big.  She's...  She's...  Her ass probably looks better in photos than it wouldn't  in person.  Oh, yeah.  I've seen pictures of her that just look horrific.  Yeah.  I like...  Her ass is a little bigger than I like.  Her ass is very intimidating, man.  Intimidating.  I would put my dick in it, though.  Yeah.  I'd give her a lousy fuck.  You want a nice ass.  All right.  You want a nice ass.  You don't want an intimidating ass.  What is she doing there?  I don't know. 
[00:46:30]  Just wiping.  She's got a big feather duster or something.  Or flowers.  Oh, it's flowers hiding her bunghole.  Yep.  That's right.  They're dying.  They're wilting flowers.  You go to the next picture, they're all fucking...  They'd fall on the floor.  Dead petals all around her feet.  Too bad it doesn't smell like flowers.  Oh, no.  Yeah, that was a candid shot because the guy she was with said that her assholes smelled  like onions.  So she was trying to rub some azaleas in it quickly.  It's nice.  All right.  She wanted her ass eaten. 
[00:47:00]  That's nice.  That's nice.  Am I going to...  Yeah.  She's been all the way over.  It's a close-up.  Yeah.  It's not...  Her thighs are way too big.  You don't want to eat ass after a tennis match, though.  Oh, man.  That's a mistake.  You would dry heave, right?  No.  See, look.  I think you would dry heave from the smell.  If not a tennis match, of course you would.  The smell would get you.  That's too big, man.  When she's just hanging out at the beach.  All I know is I was at a strip club once, and some black chick was really, like, sweaty  from dancing and shit like that, and she came over and decided she wanted to stick her 
[00:47:30]  crotch in my face.  I fucking...  I was like...  It was a little rough.  I was backing away.  It was a little rough, right?  I couldn't...  Yeah.  First of all, you know, there's plenty of little white chicks running around that I would  rather have had in front of me.  She's, like, trying to...  She saw that I was doling out a couple of bucks, you know?  So she comes flying in like the vultures they are.  Those fucking strippers.  And then, yeah, she, like, shoves it in my face.  I'm like, oh, get out of here. 
[00:48:00]  Ruining my night.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So no one's coming up with a big, boobed Olympic athlete.  Olympia, Olympic athlete.  Whoever's in...  You know why?  Because they never make the final cut.  That's probably...  Find all the ones that dropped out in, like, round two.  Bunch of fat tits sitting on the fucking dugout steps all depressed.  Bunch of fat tits crying that they just missed.  Yeah.  You can always tell the ones with the giant tits because they're hunched over crying  as the coach says, you did good.  You did the best you could with those fucking... 
[00:48:30]  You should be very proud.  Yeah.  With your giant fucking burdens in front of you.  Sure, you didn't make the Olympics, but you'll at least have boyfriends.  These little fucking...  Yeah.  ...scarecrow-titted nothings.  Mutants.  ...are finished.  As soon as the Olympics are over, they got nothing.  Fucking ironing board bodies.  She's a pretty face there.  Serena.  Or Venus.  Hey, man.  There's a lot...  A lot of people think she's really sexy.  She's a little bigger than I like, but she's a pretty girl.  She's not ugly. 
[00:49:00]  Way too thick for me, man.  Way too athletic, too.  There's way too much muscle in that body.  I'd give her a little smooch.  I don't mind a little muscle, but...  Man, not...  No.  Not like that.  Meh.  Why don't we break...  All right.  ...get into some other shit.  We want to know about Jim Norton's wallet.  We got some Dane Cook stuff to get into.  It's like a wallet.  We got...  You want to save this for in-show or play going to break?  We got to talk about it.  All right.  We'll save it for in-show.  We'll explain next.  Hit it. 
[00:49:30]  Sirius XM.  You're listening to O.B. Anthony.  London calling to the faraway towns.  Now war is declared.  And battle come down.  London calling to the underworld.  Come out of the coven.  You boys...  For the Olympic, C-Rock?  London calling...  That's O.B.  They didn't play this during the opening ceremony.  You'd think they would, but they didn't.  What?  What songs did they play during the opening ceremony?  Pink Floyd and... 
[00:50:00]  Na, na, na, na, na, na, na.  Na, na, na, na, na, na, na.  Sir.  They had Sir Paul McCartney.  Do a little Hey Jude to close it up.  That was all right.  Monkeys did come together.  And what?  Did they have Muhammad Ali?  Because I tuned in late to the opening ceremonies.  I heard it was brutal.  They're just bringing them out for every event at this point.  Getting the last out of them, huh? 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  I was just reading.  This is for...  This song is about war, dumb, Iraq.  Not the best song for an international peaceful event.  Whatever.  But you could use the London...  Whatever.  But you could use the London calling part.  No, we're just calling everyone to London.  They played it.  They did it for some promos.  No, they played it during the opening ceremony.  Oh, Iraq.  I did not hear it.  I don't think they did.  Yes, they did.  It was during...  It was during that...  That really long, like... 
[00:51:00]  Story of...  John.  You know how they went through, like, the 70s to, like, now with music?  And it went on forever.  Yeah.  It was played during that.  Definitely.  And he didn't...  No, I mean, you know.  I don't think it did.  Well, okay.  Well, what were you doing?  Maybe you were getting a Coke float while they were playing that.  Oh.  You know what Eric did over the weekend?  He thought he was being funny.  And he texted me a picture of ice cream. 
[00:51:30]  And he meant to write, this would go great in a Coke float.  But he had a typo.  And he wrote, this would go great in a cum float.  No, there was no typo.  Thank you.  Yeah.  You sure there was a typo?  Just flirting.  Yeah, they had Muhammad Ali in it.  Not good.  Oh, boy.  Wow, his legs look really thin now, too, huh?  Oh, boy.  What are you supposed to do in that case?  I don't know.  Not have your wife trot you out to everything? 
[00:52:00]  You think he doesn't want anything to do with this?  Yes.  No, I don't know about that.  I don't...  I think he...  He always loved attention, though.  Yeah, but...  Cal Ripken Jr. said he thought this is what Ali would have wanted to have been at all these events.  Well, all right.  If Ripken says that, then that's true.  Ripken told me, anyway.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, um...  If you...  Ali, and when we were kings, when he had Parkinson's, his biographer said,  Muhammad does not feel sorry for himself. 
[00:52:30]  He doesn't want people to feel sorry for him.  He loved being Muhammad Ali.  He's not embarrassed by his condition.  Well, then how about he stays home?  Well, he doesn't mind being out there.  No, but we do feel sorry for him.  So if he doesn't want us feeling sorry for him, how about you stay home?  They kind of like...  Because it's kind of uncomfortable to watch at this point.  They symbolically passed the flag to him, but, like, they just stopped in front of him  and then kept going.  Here's my point with Muhammad Ali.  What was it?  The Atlanta games when he did that fucking climb up to the cauldron? 
[00:53:00]  Yes.  You're never going to beat that.  Holy fuck, have him in a seat, maybe, and acknowledge how great he is.  But could you go back to those Atlanta games when he showed up out of nowhere  and they gave him the torch and he fucking walks up the, what, 200-foot staircase?  He's in a wheelchair, though.  It's so sad.  Holy shit.  He was shaking bad, too, right, at that point.  He was already, yeah, on his way.  But they brought him out.  At age 54, as he takes the hand of the IOC president.  This is the lost medal. 
[00:53:30]  This is not going to be the lighting of the torch thing.  Yes, Sam, the indoor part.  Oh, Sam.  This moment.  Ladies and gentlemen, the Olympic plane is now approaching the stadium.  My point is you're just not going to beat this, so just have him sit in a great seat.  Thanks, man.  I want to hear when they pass it off to Ali.  Oh, that place goes nuts.  Vander Holyfield?  Yeah, Vander Holyfield's got it.  Commander Evander. 
[00:54:00]  It's a firefly.  It's a place going wild.  Now he walks off the stage.  And no one knew this was going down, right?  Right.  Especially Ali, they just stuck it in him here.  Ha, ha.  If this doesn't give you chills, then you're just not a human being.  So there's an Atlanta team connection.  Now he's running.  Where's he running?  He's stealing it.  Trying to sell it. 
[00:54:30]  Drug money.  Making his way through the athletes.  To the track.  He is the race.  Oh, lap.  Oh, Hans Gruber.  Good saw from Clockwork Orange there.  Good saw from Clockwork Orange there.  Good show to join.  And die part.  And the woman who takes it from him is Vula Petuladou.  Vula Petuladou?  Really?  In the 1992 Barcelona Games, she became the first Greek woman.  Oh, boy. 
[00:55:00]  She's carrying it in her ass.  Her big, hairy ass.  Her broke ass.  Her dear spell, Petuladou took the gold medal.  And the symbolism there, not only man to woman, but American, Atlanta, the host to the originators  of the Olympic Games, both in antiquity and the first modern games.  All right, Bob.  Oh, my God.  Shut up, Bob.  Yeah, shut up, Bob.  This is going on forever.  I'd rather hear their feet hitting the pavement than Bob yammering on.  Petuladou. 
[00:55:30]  That is a good song, though.  This is the song that Alex gets in his fucking face when he's at the end.  Yeah, yeah.  When he's jerking off, picturing the girl.  Ludwig van.  It's not right.  I should feel ill when I hear lovely, lovely Ludwig van.  What he wants to do is jerk off, thinking of rape and Beethoven.  What a trooper.  What can we do in the lap?  Oh, my God.  Let's do this.  Oh, mighty Sam.  Jesus.  Starting to back into the Holyfield's house. 
[00:56:00]  He's backing out of the driveway.  We are committed on that.  Fuck it.  Yeah, I know.  We're all in.  That's great.  Who is this fucking...  All right, they stopped.  Now what happens?  I don't know.  Someone's lighting a cigarette off of it.  Yeah.  Who is she?  Recognize her?  Yeah.  It's Kelly Leak.  Who is that?  Bad news, Bears.  They're the greatest female distance from her.  Holy, Lee.  That's stupid hairdo.  It's Joyce DeWitt. 
[00:56:30]  Almost surely final Olympics.  She says so.  Competing in the 400 and...  They got to fucking go around the whole track.  I know.  I would be so tuckered out.  Terrible.  I would complain.  I'd want to drive my Saturn around.  Making her way around the track.  Just handed to me through the window while I zip around.  I'm sorry.  What's Costco's talking about?  How her feet were sewn on after an accident? 
[00:57:00]  The Shaq.  The Shaq.  In the crowd.  Fucking horrible fucking pimp hat.  The Olympics are on.  We're watching Olympics from 16 years ago.  Exactly.  Well, I didn't realize she was going to get the long version of the video.  But we're all in now.  So now it's Janet Evans.  She's got the tour.  She's only 40 minutes left.  Walking up.  All right.  Now we're getting close to the college.  And she's running a good distance.  Hurry up.  All right.  Probably going to start the video there. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, and there he is.  Ali, who's accidentally set himself on fire.  Oh, my God.  We already had the shaky left arm.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Next scene is just fire trucks.  Yeah.  Yes.  Once the most dynamic figure in sports, a gregarious man, now trapped inside that mask created by Parkinson's syndrome. 
[00:58:00]  Jesus.  Thanks.  Thanks.  You get it.  Inside that punch.  Shit.  Sometimes you don't read the words, Bob.  Yeah.  And the response he evokes is part affection, part exciting.  Oh, no.  He can't light it.  Oh, no.  Fire's creeping up towards his arm.  Oh, no.  For Christ's sake, light it.  Oh, no.  Lee, Jesus.  Boom.  It just explodes.  Yeah.  It's bad.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  The guy just ran up and punched him right into the flame.  Oh, what's happening?  Oh, there it goes.  Well, the fire's being lofted up.  What was the one where he walks up the stairs?  Wow, man.  I got weird dreams.  Gold medal boxer.  Yeah.  Do you remember him walking up, like, the stairs?  I remember him jogging with it or something.  I do remember him walking with it.  Longer time ago than this.  Yeah. 
[00:59:00]  No, man.  I thought it...  Oh, wow.  Holy fuck.  I remember this completely different.  No steps.  Because now it's the fire just going up on a thing to the cauldron.  It's shot up there.  And then it lights the cauldron that way.  I remember him walking up or something.  Upstairs.  No?  No.  Was that for something else?  I was probably a slinky.  Wow.  Holy fuck.  I remember that differently.  Yeah, that's all right.  Bill Clinton's there.  There's Bill Clinton.  So that was a waste of time.  That was...  Who gives a fuck? 
[00:59:30]  It was an alley shaking.  That's not where they're wearing the dumb hats.  I think Costas pointed it out.  Yeah, no kidding.  He once was the greatest.  Now he is trapped in this...  In a living hell.  Yes.  In Ethel Thayer's body from on Golden Pond.  He's shaking like Katherine Hepper.  All right.  We got it, Bob.  We know what Parkinson's is.  He just feels like he has to add words to everything.  Sometimes you just let it happen.  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  Oh, nip slip in female...  Yeah, yeah.  The water polo. 
[01:00:00]  The chick water polo.  A tit flew right out.  Is this this year's Olympics?  I think so, yeah.  Nice.  Yeah, a tit fell out.  Anyway.  Jimmy, I saw your tweets.  You left us on Thursday to do the Montreal Comedy Festival.  I did, yes.  I want to know, A, how it went.  I want to know what the fuck happened.  Because you weren't able to fly right away.  You had a shitty day at the airport.  And I want to know about your wallet, too.  I had a 1040 flight.  I wanted to get up there early because I was supposed to be shooting.  We had a show the night, Thursday night.  It was a live event Friday on a Canadian thing called The Movie Network, which is their HBO. 
[01:00:30]  And it was going out live.  How many people, do you think?  I don't know.  There was 3,000 in the theater.  But I mean...  How many people watched something like that?  Millions, I guess.  Millions?  It was a big show.  Wow.  Saget hosting.  I think it was a dirty show.  Myself.  And again, Amy was on it.  Jimmy Carr, who's a really funny fuck from England.  Mike Wilmot, who's a very funny dude.  Canadian dude from fucking...  Canada.  Yeah.  But he lives in England now.  But there were some really funny people on the show. 
[01:01:00]  Triumph was on it.  You know, Smigel.  It was just a really good show.  So, I'm supposed to tape this fucking food show during the day when I get up there.  This guy who eats nothing.  He's like Sam.  He's like a guy who's only eating a few different meals.  Yeah.  So, you know, they have comedians taking him out for these weird meals.  So, I get to the airport for a 1040 flight.  And the storms are beginning.  And I'm at United and Newark Airport.  And they say, your flight's canceled.  So, I'm like, fuck. 
[01:01:30]  So, she says, the next three flights are canceled.  She goes, but there is an Air Canada flight out of LaGuardia at 1255.  And it's like, I have like two hours to make it.  So, I walk to the Air Canada desk in Newark real quick.  Because she hands me this fucking transfer ticket.  Because they're both part of the Star Alliance.  Oh, the Star Alliance.  Yeah.  So, the Air Canada flights out of Newark are also canceled.  So, I fucking hop in a taxi in a panic.  I get to LaGuardia.  Turns out this now flight is delayed two hours. 
[01:02:00]  The one I'm going to.  But at least I know I'll make it.  So, I walk up to the desk at Air Canada.  And I present them with my ticket.  And they say, we're not honoring this.  Oh.  And I say, but why?  But they're part of the Star Alliance.  I say, you're part of the Star Alliance.  And they go, well, no, we have to take care of our people first.  So, I say to the woman behind the counter, well, why would they send me here on a ticket that I can't use?  And she says, probably to get rid of you.  Oh, man. 
[01:02:30]  Wow.  That's what the woman working for Air Canada says.  She says, they do it all the time.  She goes, they wanted to get rid of you, so they sent you here.  Holy fuck.  So, I'm going to point out.  That's a huge inconvenience.  It's a big inconvenience.  That's not quite customer service.  It's a terrible insult.  To go from Newark to LaGuardia.  Yeah.  At that time is a major inconvenience.  I'm livid.  Yeah.  I'm afraid I'm going to get arrested in the airport.  Wow.  I'm so angry.  So, I walk over to the United people here in LaGuardia now. 
[01:03:00]  And this is because I've gone to LaGuardia.  The Air Canada people, they're the only ones that do Montreal flights.  She says, all of our flights are sold out until 8.30 tonight.  We're taking care of Air Canada people first.  You're a United passenger.  You're not one of our passengers.  So, I walk to the United thing.  I look into an office.  There's one of those doors that are open.  They're never open.  And I see two guys in ties.  Just laughing at their customers.  They're pointing at TVs of their customers.  Going, ah, look at this idiot.  Hanging on ropes.  Yeah.  So, I walk in. 
[01:03:30]  I plead my case.  And they're sympathetic.  Because it's from...  They're like, no, no, no.  Well, she wouldn't send you.  She wouldn't send you to get rid of you.  So, this guy comes on shift.  And he walks into the office.  They're like, hey, see if you can help this guy.  And I guess he's the shift manager for customer service for United at LaGuardia.  His name is Sal.  White guy.  Glasses.  Late 30s, mid-40s.  Very nice guy.  Very helpful.  And he tells me the Air Canada people are wrong.  He says, this is a confirmed reservation.  I had upgraded to first with Miles. 
[01:04:00]  And he goes, you're supposed to be on this flight.  So, he marches me back to Air Canada.  And he says, this guy is absolutely...  It's a confirmed reservation.  And they're like, well, he didn't get a ticket.  And they're supposed to call over here.  And he said, you're part of the Star Alliance.  She's like, we're taking care of our passengers.  He goes, he is your passenger now.  Yes.  It's a ticket.  It's a perfectly valid reserve seat.  And they're going back and forth.  Nice.  And he goes, I want to speak to the...  I forget what they're called.  But it's the woman who runs...  Mr. Canada. 
[01:04:30]  Mr. Canada.  That's right.  He said, I want to speak to Air C.  So, he gets the head of Air Canada.  Whoever's on charge of Air Canada at Newark, at LaGuardia.  And they have the final say.  They're the complete boss.  They will not honor the ticket.  Wow.  So, now I'm saying that I have no ticket to Canada.  I have no ticket.  What did the guy say to you after he went to Bat Boy?  He goes, they're not honoring it.  I mean, and I said, he goes, we would help you.  But everything, he goes, everything we have is through Air Canada right now. 
[01:05:00]  And he goes, everything we have in the Midwest is closed because of the airports.  So, he walked away from me?  No, no, no.  He stood with me.  This guy, Sal, was a good dude.  He did what he could.  Like, I knew he tried to help me.  And he really pushed for me.  But it was either that or he had to strangle.  He goes, simply, she's wrong.  And she won't take it.  So, I buy a ticket.  Because now I want to just try to go stand by.  So, I spend $1,500 for a first class ticket. 
[01:05:30]  Because they said that that class of ticket will help me on standby lists for earlier flights.  Because it's a much higher ticket than most people have.  And so, I want to put myself ahead of the list as much as I can.  So, I spend $1,500 on a ticket.  I had a $400 ticket.  $1,500 for a 58-minute flight.  Oh, my God.  So, I go.  Sal does what he can for me.  I go to the, I get on the standby list. 
[01:06:00]  I go.  And they tell me I'm in the top 10.  But, of course, I don't realize that I'm in the top 10 of people who already have later tickets and want to go earlier.  That does not help me when it comes to people who have been, what they call, not inconvenienced, but people who have been displaced.  Which means their flights have been canceled.  They take priority over everyone.  So, I hear name after name after name.  Basically, I hear, could not Jim Norton, not Jim Norton, anyone but Jim Norton.  Not James Norton. 
[01:06:30]  Not Norton.  Not Norton.  Not Jim Norton.  Not Jim Norton.  No, Jim Norton.  They call 30 people for the 1255 flight, which is now 230.  Was it really 30?  At least.  Holy fuck.  I was not one of them.  Holy fuck.  Oh, my God.  That flight.  I'm livid right now.  That flight comes and goes.  I have now a 530 flight.  No, a 330 flight and a 530 flight and then my 830 flight.  Which, of course, I wanted to do my warm-up show.  Uh-huh.  Which happened at 10 p.m.  And I'm like, I'm not going to make my warm-up show at 10 p.m. 
[01:07:00]  So, the 530 flight is about five minutes away.  I go up to the woman.  Wait, you left here at 830 in the morning?  Yeah.  Or a 1045.  And now what time is it at the airport?  It's, uh, it's probably, it's going on 330 now at one point.  Oh, my God.  And I walk up to the woman behind the counter and I say, look, they're not treating me like  a displaced passenger.  I'm a displaced passenger on United.  And she was very nice.  She goes, yeah, but we have to take care of Air Canada passengers.  I'm like, look, they gave me a reservation. 
[01:07:30]  Air Canada wouldn't honor it.  I bought this J ticket for $1,500 to get on an earlier flight.  They're not honoring my ticket, but they're not treating me like a displaced passenger.  It's like, I'm a platinum flyer on United.  And it's like, I know that you have to take care of your other passengers, but if you're  part of the Star Alliance, and I'm like, what's the use of having partnerships if you're  treated like garbage?  Yeah.  So right as they're, I'm literally hearing all these names again, and I'm not getting  on.  And then she looks at me and she calls me and she waves me and goes, Mr. Norton, and 
[01:08:00]  she brings me up.  And I said, I want to hug you.  And she goes, we got you on.  And she gives me a seat.  I'm such an ass.  I didn't mean to.  I'm like, oh, do you have an aisle?  And she goes, no.  Oh, Jesus.  But I wasn't put, I'm like, I'm sorry.  I can't believe I just asked that.  So I got on the flight and I landed at probably 6 p.m.  because the flight was already late to begin with.  So I got in at 6 p.m.  And that was my travel day.  I did get to the venue and I did the gig and I was freaked out because they had me going 
[01:08:30]  last.  I have no self-confidence as a comedian.  I really don't.  Oh, you're silly.  I really don't.  I don't believe I'm last.  And I started, I've been opening, I've been doing material by Colorado.  So, um, none of it's, I'm not smashing the victims or anything.  The material has been destroying in New York.  It's about a 10 minute hunk on the Colorado shootings.  And, uh, again, no crowds have groaned at it and crowds will groan if it's, but I'm,  I think I'm sidestepping any landmines.  Without giving away your material, what's your angle that people aren't groaning? 
[01:09:00]  I open up attacking the media and I open up pointing out how the media, they do their  jobs for the first day and then they get into this area where they're just fishing.  And I make fun of them and I say that they have a guy on the, you know, we have someone  who was at the Batman premiere, uh, with Michael Keaton, you know, blah, blah, blah.  And I go into kind of that angle and I attacked him for calling him the Joker.  Then I make fun of that couple.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I go into an angle where nobody, I, and I, and the crowds have loved it so much.  And I think that they're loving the fact that they know that it's a brutal subject and 
[01:09:30]  I'm not stepping on landmines.  It's a really weird feeling.  That's why I'm asking.  Cause it's, yeah, this is a difficult one.  It's a weird feeling from the audience.  Like I've gotten an overwhelmingly nice response and I know it's a relief on their part.  Like, wow, we can laugh about this without feeling like we're bashing the victims at all.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're not feeling guilty about it.  It's a really weird response I felt from the audience because I've done topical stuff  where they laugh, but this time I feel like they're laughing and they're relieved and 
[01:10:00]  they're like, oh man, I'm so happy you said that and that you're going in this direction  with it.  It's a very odd feeling I've gotten from audiences by, it really does matter where you put the  joke, but whatever.  So that was my, but it didn't work well in Canada.  So I figured they're not as in tune with the, maybe the daily goings on.  Right.  But it didn't work as well as I wanted it to.  So I switched.  Probably because their media is very different.  Maybe a little bit different.  And I'm sure they pick up on American TV, but.  Yeah.  It just didn't work as well.  But not like we do. 
[01:10:30]  So, but I panicked so much they put me second instead of last.  I felt bad.  I didn't even need to go second.  I just didn't want to go last.  And the live show went very well.  Saget was great.  Bob Saget talked me off a ledge.  I was so, you know, Bob Saget was really, really great.  Why did he have to talk you off a ledge?  Because I was so freaked out about going last.  I just panicked about that shit, dude.  And it really is a lack of confidence and I hate myself for it.  You know, I thought of Patrice the whole time.  I'm like, he would just be so dismissive of these people because that's how he handled  being nervous, you know. 
[01:11:00]  And I admired him so much for his ability to be bigger in those moments.  He had that and I don't.  Yeah, yeah.  So no, but it is what it is.  So I'm very annoyed at myself.  But I mean, the set went great.  And Amy was great.  She was really funny.  Everybody did well.  The show was a fucking smith.  Live TV, that's awesome.  Yeah.  On live TV.  Dane Cook got in trouble for doing his Batman.  I know he did.  And it really bothers me.  It's amazing how they're going after you guys. 
[01:11:30]  They're going after you guys like they went after radio guys about four or five years ago.  And I think at the time we said, look, you know, they're not going to stop there.  They're going to move on.  And we thought at the time, I remember we thought at the time that they would never actually  go after comics.  But at this point, they're going after you guys pretty much one a month.  And Dane's joke was a little rougher.  But you know what?  It's an absolutely defensible joke.  Dane is not.  And this is a point I tweeted for defending him because never in recorded history.  This is what pigs the media are. 
[01:12:00]  And this is where people have to tweet the New York Post and the Daily News and all the  papers.  You have to let them know that you are aware of this.  Never has a comedian inspired a copycat murder.  Never.  Never.  Yeah.  And these pigs know.  They know that it happens because every expert has told them, do not talk about these killers  in the way they want to be spoken about.  That doesn't mean don't shit on them as a comic.  Don't talk about them like they're like these misunderstood anti-heroes. 
[01:12:30]  And don't read their writing like they're deep.  Like they're deep.  Like they're these mad geniuses.  Like they're these complicated myths.  And yet the media does it knowing that it inspires copycats.  They know it for an absolute fact.  It's been proven.  Expert after expert after expert has said it to them.  And they don't give a fuck.  They do it anyway.  Right.  And they do it without any repercussions.  Without anybody calling them on it.  And then they turn around and they'll go after Dane Cook. 
[01:13:00]  And they go after Dane Cook.  Knowing what they do.  And they go after Dane Cook.  So any comic that doesn't defend Dane Cook, you're a fucking fraud.  Yeah.  Any comic.  I agree.  That doesn't defend Dane.  Wow, what a great point.  Whether you like Dane or not, if you don't defend him, you're a fucking fraud.  Even if Dane apologized, maybe he felt bad about it.  But the fucking media, the fact that they would go after this guy, hey, we're just reporting the news.  No, you're not.  You're not just reporting the news.  Just like putting this guy's picture in the paper, Choker's Madhouse is not just reporting the news. 
[01:13:30]  Here's the Dane Cook joke.  So I heard that the guy came into the theater about 25 minutes into the movie.  And if you've seen the movie, the movie's pretty much a piece of crap.  And, yeah, spoiler alert.  And I know that if none of that had happened, I'm pretty sure that somebody in that theater about 25 minutes in realizing it was a piece of crap probably was like,  Oh, fucking shoot me. 
[01:14:00]  Getting a good response.  Yeah.  Okay, I got to be honest.  I coached you a little with the pantomime.  What did you say at the end about?  I don't know.  I coached you a little with the pantomime.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  But that's the joke.  That's the joke.  These pigs have been putting this guy's picture on the front page every day.  And it's, I'm sorry to y'all, but it's revenue generating. 
[01:14:30]  They do it to sell papers.  Fuck the victims.  Fuck the shooting victims.  We're going to put, and fuck any other victims that may come because of copycats.  We're going to put his picture on the front page because we want to generate revenue.  We want to make money.  And a comic makes a joke, and all of a sudden, it's outrageous.  Fuck the papers, and fuck the public for not sticking up for people.  You guys deserve the sanitized garbage you get because you don't stick up for people. 
[01:15:00]  You buy the papers.  You don't call the media on it.  When copycats happen, you're like, what happened?  Why did that happen?  And then a comic does something, and you don't go, wait, why are you guys attacking him?  He's not the one who's putting this pig's picture on the front page.  Right.  And a comedian has never inspired a copycat.  Because I'm telling you, the way Dane made fun of that guy, or the way any comic is goofing  on this guy's shitty orange hairdo or whatever, is not the way an anti-hero wants to be portrayed. 
[01:15:30]  So comedians are actually talking about these cocksuckers, these fucking shooters,  the way they should be addressed.  That's how comics talk about them.  The paper's talking about them the way they want to be spoken about.  Fucking makes me crazy, man.  It makes me crazy.  Even they've said it over the years when they've interviewed these fucking animals.  They've loved the attention that they got.  They love it.  Yeah, they're playing right into their hands.  And that type of attention.  They don't like being goofed on. 
[01:16:00]  They don't like being treated like they're not serious.  Oh, a joke.  I like your angle, Jimmy.  That's great.  It really is.  How about they talk about the fact, what was wrong with this guy?  Not the mad genius, but what a broken little nobody he is.  And that's what the guy is.  And that's how he should be spoken about.  Yes.  He's a broken, selfish little nobody.  He's just a creep.  A manifesto and a fucking, oh, all right. 
[01:16:30]  His boring ramblings.  His self-serving, self-centered, baby boy obsessed, notice me ramblings.  And the joke got a great reaction.  Yeah, because the audience saw what he did.  He got him.  The crowd saw, hey, once again, once again, comedy's the place you can't do it, right?  Like, again, dress up, play a fucking, a child molester in the woodsman.  That's terrific.  Make fun of it and you're a bad person. 
[01:17:00]  And it's like the public perpetuates this stuff.  Because they fucking, these feminist blog about Tasha's dumb rape jokes.  You know, everyone's got a reason why you shouldn't do stuff.  Fucking, it drives me nuts.  It's nonsense.  By the way, Mitch in Montreal, I was at the show this weekend, Jim rocked.  Thank you, man.  Thank you, Mitch.  There you go.  But I don't blame Dane for, did Dane apologize, I guess?  Well, I'm sure, you know, it's the fake apology thing, which I don't mind at this point.  You know, he's got to save his ass because no one else out there is going to help him out. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  No one.  No one's going to come to his defense.  I don't hear anyone coming to his defense.  Twitter was a bit light on defending Dane.  Well, yeah, because they think it's hip to trash Dane.  But the bottom line is, he's going to fucking.  I'm so sick of that.  It's hip to trash Dane Cook.  Guy has had an amazing career so far.  Maybe you don't like his type of fucking comedy or whatever, but.  His brand of humor.  But you can't deny the fact the guy has been amazingly successful at it. 
[01:18:00]  The public deserves.  It's hip to fucking trash him, really?  They think it is, yeah.  So stupid.  The public deserves.  Think for yourself.  The sanitized garbage they get.  That you deserve.  Enjoy it.  Because none of you, and I say none of you, plenty of you do, but a lot, enough people  don't.  Like, now that there's Twitter and you can tell people how you feel.  Yeah.  You know how you let the press know you think they're fucking, they're scumbags?  Like, for real.  Twitter them.  Let them.  Believe me, we all read our at mentions.  Yeah.  A reporter doing that shit.  With a post doing that, and people saying, you're pigs, you're contributing to this 
[01:18:30]  for real.  Yeah.  Not in some rape jokes, create an environment of indifference to a condition type bullshit.  Experts have proven and said time and time again, from the testimony and the words of  people that do the shooting, that this type of stuff fucking motivates them, and it's  what they want.  Right.  They're contributing for real.  Dude, for real, they're contributing.  There's your headline today.  And they know it.  And they don't give a fuck.  No, they don't care.  They don't give a fuck.  There's too much at risk. 
[01:19:00]  They need their ratings.  Terrible.  For ad revenue.  Truly fucking terrible.  They don't give a fuck if another shooter pops up because of what they're doing.  They're making a shitload of money off these tragedies.  They love these tragedies.  Dude, they love them.  Are you kidding me?  They love them.  They love them.  I bet you they're really happy.  This happened about a week and a half, two weeks before the Olympics, so they had enough  time.  They could block off two weeks.  Like, fuck, this is perfect.  And then we move into the Olympics.  Yep.  And hopefully then maybe there's a copycat one right after the Olympics are over.  And this is a perfect world we live in. 
[01:19:30]  They love disaster.  Of course they did.  If they didn't love it, they live for it.  They wouldn't cover it the way they do.  Yep.  Now, a lot of people go, well, that's crazy.  That's crazy talk.  No, they fucking can't wait for the next one.  They can't wait.  Yeah.  And it's really to generate sales.  Like, a comic gets laughs.  Right.  For the night.  Right.  But do you realize the amount of money they make from selling paper?  Like, literally, they put this guy in the paper because they want to grab your attention 
[01:20:00]  and have you buy their product.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, what fucking do you?  You can't be a bigger whore than that.  That's like putting a movie poster with, like, his image flashing on it.  People would be outraged.  Can I ask you something?  Why is it terrible to joke about the tragedy?  Now, obviously, the victims, the victims' families, anyone close to the situation is horrible.  But comedy is based on that.  Yeah.  Every time you make a joke or write a line on Twitter or something, you're offending somebody.  You're completely offending someone. 
[01:20:30]  Every joke, you offend somebody.  People are too afraid to take the outrage that comes to them.  But the outrage is really smoke.  Who gives a shit if a lot of people don't like what you said?  Like, I'm disgusted with what happened over there in Aurora.  Yeah.  I can separate the two.  But then if there's a funny line by Dane Cook or somebody else, I can appreciate that in a weird way.  Sure.  Because I don't know anyone.  I don't know any of those people.  And it's horrible for those people and their families.  And, you know, we try to do what we can. 
[01:21:00]  You know, people are tweeting funds and all that shit.  But what's the difference?  Why can't you make fun of it?  Because, again, people have a weird line.  And I don't think it's the comedian's job to respect that line.  No.  Don't respect the lines.  Because everyone feels their line is legitimate.  Right.  No one feels like they're being an asshole.  That's what I'm getting at.  When you make a joke on this radio show or you tweet a funny line, you're pissing off somebody.  Somebody.  Always.  I mean, every single time, by the way. 
[01:21:30]  People say rape isn't funny.  You're right.  It's not.  But then again, neither is having your fucking head bashed in with a wrench.  Right.  The stooges do it.  It makes me laugh.  Rape not funny, but making fun of rape could be funny.  Absolutely.  That's the difference.  And like Anne said, I think you were gone because we were talking about this a little bit on Friday.  You know, we make fun of stuff that affects us personally.  Yeah.  Every day.  But we're not going to do much.  We're not going to give you the list of shit that, you know, where our lines are, maybe.  If it's funny, it's funny. 
[01:22:00]  Right.  That's it.  Right.  Yeah.  But if it is close to you, I don't blame you for, you know.  Not enjoying it, but why would you, like, oh, that kind of bothered me.  Oh, I know what it was.  Port wine stains.  We were making fun of that.  And then a guy called up and his daughter has a port wine stain.  I'm like, oh, why'd you clean it off?  So I'm like.  Stain remover or something.  Oh, come on.  You're too much.  So what I should have asked that guy on Friday, like, obviously, that's way too close to home  and you're not going to laugh at port wine stain humor or jokes. 
[01:22:30]  But what are some of the other shit you have laughed at because you listen to the show on  a regular basis?  And it would be a whole list of things that I'm sure affect other people.  Yeah.  I feel like we say this stuff, I feel like nobody hears it.  Like, it's like, I really feel like we're just yelling into the fucking wind and nobody.  It's insanity to me.  And this is.  That people object to humor.  And this is real honesty that the rest of the media doesn't tackle at all. 
[01:23:00]  The only way I think to back yourself up is to brutalize them back.  Like, brutalize them back.  Which we do on this show.  Absolutely.  I think they're all a bunch of jokes at this point.  It's brutal.  For the most part.  I mean, you got guys that are trying to work around the system, but.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, wait.  What happened?  Your wallet?  Oh.  No, but I actually.  So you lost your wallet? 
[01:23:30]  Wait, did I cancel the wrong credit card?  I am so stupid.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Yeah, I did.  Oh, no.  Cigars and scotch.  If Dane Cook said it at a memorial, that's one thing.  This was a private room.  Yeah.  Hey, we never.  You deserve what you get if you're saying something like that at the memorial for the victims.  It's a comedy club.  But it's a comedy club where you're supposed to twist some shit.  Why did I do that?  You're supposed to twist some dark shit and try to get some laughs out of it.  Exactly.  What happened with your wallet there, Jim Norton? 
[01:24:00]  Lost it and got it back.  Really nice.  But you know, I have to cut up my one credit card.  I, I, I, and this Bank of America one is my, uh, is my, my, my ATM card.  Your ATM, your debit card.  But, uh, it was so frustrating because I called, I canceled my credit card.  So I was like, someone told me I was going to get it back.  But in the Bank of America, their business, they stink. 
[01:24:30]  Their small business center stinks.  So they can cancel it, but they couldn't reorder it for me until today.  And I'm like, but what if somebody in the tranny bar turns it in?  Then it's like, what am I going to, what am I really going to happen?  What, did I lose my wallet in the tranny bar?  Yeah.  It happens.  I wouldn't even know where that is.  Um, I didn't either.  Please explain.  Well, I'll be.  What day was this?  Uh, Saturday night.  Saturday night you decided, uh, I'm going to go to a tranny bar? 
[01:25:00]  I really did.  Yeah, I was bored.  Did you go with anyone?  No.  By myself.  And I actually.  Didn't you and Colin Quinn once go to a.  A tranny show or something?  Years ago, yeah, yeah.  That story was pretty funny.  I remember you guys talking about that once.  I went, um, on, I just, it was, I had finished my shows and I was bored.  I wasn't horny.  I was really bored.  And I'm like, I want to go to a fucking tranny bar.  I just wanted to.  And, uh, I fucking went online.  I found where there was a tranny party.  Oh.  A tranny party.  A tranny party.  And I went into this club and it was a very surreal, but I literally have never done that 
[01:25:30]  before.  It was a bizarre, surreal feeling.  Hmm.  And it was just, it was like a really weird bar, very narrow.  And, and they had two little, like, uh, stages set up for tranny dancers.  Ha, ha, ha.  And they actually were really hot.  This was on, like, in the fifties.  Um.  And what makes them hot?  They look like women.  I mean, they look just.  They really look like women.  Just like.  If I didn't know where I was, it would, I wouldn't have known.  If you squint, they look like women or if your eyes are wide open? 
[01:26:00]  Maybe just in comparison to a couple of other, because a couple of them look like Java, man.  There was one that looked like Cain Velasquez.  What if the lights were on a little brighter?  Hard to say, because again, you're making a relative comparison to other people.  Gotcha.  But, um, I only, I didn't stay long.  I literally stayed for about 30, 35 minutes.  And, and I didn't drink.  I just kind of stood around and observed.  You said I didn't drink.  Were you thinking of drinking?  No, no.  I mean, like, you clubs are.  Oh, God.  All right.  Oh, no, no.  No booze. 
[01:26:30]  You said that so casually.  I'm like, oh, my God.  Are you starting to think that way?  I wish I would have had a friend there with me.  Like, I wish Bob Kelly or somebody just to fucking, because it was, I guess I've been in so  many, I've jerked off in so many places.  Just being in a place like this, it didn't seem that weird to me.  And it was like, it didn't turn me on.  It was like, I would, I would go, I would go just to goof on the whole thing.  No, I didn't.  But would you be mad if someone was with you goofing on the whole thing?  No.  I mean, I'm not even, that's not why I went, but I didn't go out of lust. 
[01:27:00]  I really went out of boredom and I wanted to do something different.  Um, I just said, fuck it.  I wanted to go just see what this was like.  And I don't know why.  I'm sure other people have opinions as to why.  I'm sure.  Yes.  But, uh, I went and, uh, again, I hung out for about a half hour and I'm like my fucking  wallet.  Cause I keep my wallet.  It's a little bit, it's like a little small.  There's no cash in my wallet.  I keep it in my front left pocket where my phone is.  So whenever I pull my phone out earlier that night, as I was heading downtown, I had dropped 
[01:27:30]  my, I pulled it out and I dropped it down the side of my seat in my truck.  I'm always dropping my wallet.  And I'm like, maybe I pulled my phone out during one of the lap dances.  I don't know.  Do you have a lap dance?  I got a couple.  Yeah.  Oh no.  And they just, could you explain a tranny lap dance?  It's the, it literally is.  It's even, aren't they monsters?  They're big.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  They're tall.  No.  And, uh, they stay dressed.  Uh, and the only touching I did was they put my hands on their tits. 
[01:28:00]  I guess they don't want you feeling anything else.  You mean their pecs?  No, they're their tits.  Please.  Oh, okay.  No, they're breasts.  They're nipples.  But, uh, that just felt kind of silly.  So I got a couple of tranny lap dances.  I do too, actually.  I hated being alone.  Jesus.  Do they really look like tits?  Honestly.  And they felt like, they felt like stripper tits.  I mean, they just, you know, I felt like.  Like fake tits.  Yeah.  Fake.  Well, you could look at it negatively like that.  I could.  What do they, uh, do they rub on you like a stripper does? 
[01:28:30]  On your legs, but they don't get too, I think.  Do you feel anything going on down there?  No, not at all.  You don't feel a tuck?  No, I did not.  But I didn't reach for it either.  Like, I didn't.  A fruit bowl on your knee?  No, I think they're pretty, um, I think they want to see what your, what your fantasy  or your thing is.  And I didn't reach, like, a couple of them, like, they all want you to take them home because  they're all hookers.  And I was like, oh, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm just hanging out.  And, oh, this is what I almost mentioned. 
[01:29:00]  I gotta be honest.  Two of the girls, yes.  Gals.  Two of the gals had probably the nicest breath of any stripper I've ever spoken to.  I even said to one, your breath is fantastic.  Oh.  And, um, and she said, thank you.  It's come.  Why would I have paused there?  Of course.  You did it to yourself.  Yeah.  But what, but no, uh, one of them said I'm eating a Halls.  I don't know. 
[01:29:30]  I didn't want to know, but like, I've had.  Anthony Michael.  He's in the other room.  Yeah.  I didn't understand.  A Halls trucking company?  No, that wouldn't make sense.  That's it.  Fuck.  Black, white, Asian.  What are we talking here?  Uh, I think Spanish.  Spanish?  I didn't, I didn't get any.  I only got a couple.  It was just.  Yeah.  More to be.  Two means three.  Now.  About three.  How crowded was it with, uh, with patrons?  It was probably.  Wait, you had a, you had a really good half hour.  Three, three lap dances in a half hour and you're out of there. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  I just, I was bored.  I honestly was bored.  And it's not, I didn't feel gross.  I didn't feel freaked out.  I was just.  Nah, I did this for a half hour.  I didn't want to spend the night there.  I just wanted to go home.  I was just, I was bored.  I texted fucking Anthony.  He was doing what he was doing.  Yeah.  So I just went home.  Wow.  With no wallet.  And then I had to call back to the tranny bar.  And I thought it was like, so funny that I left.  Did you think that one of the guys, uh.  No, I didn't think any of the patrons took it.  No, no, no. 
[01:30:30]  You think one of the guys took it out of your, uh.  No.  His pants?  No, no, no.  I knew that didn't happen.  During a lap dance or something?  No one was doing that.  And, uh, it's under my phone.  Nobody would have even known to do that.  So how the fuck do you leave it there?  Just pulling my phone out.  Literally pulling my phone out.  And, and, and fucking, uh, texting or checking.  You know, you just do that when you, when there's no one to talk to.  And it dropped.  And it fell on the floor.  Yeah.  So what I did was, I called.  I looked around.  I had one of the bouncers looking.  Um.  I mean, thank God it's me.  And I don't give a fuck.  Like, thank God I'm not a fucking, like, an actor who. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, imagine that.  Because I, I laughed to myself.  I'm like, I'm in a tranny bar.  And I got the guy with the fucking flashlight looking behind the couch.  And looking by the ATM machine and all these places.  And I took a leak in the men's room and checked my phone.  And I'm like, where did I drop it?  I don't know.  So I called when I got home.  I said, fuck it, let me call.  And I said to the guy who answered the phone, like, look, I left my wallet there.  I don't expect anyone to find it.  But there's a $150 reward.  Oh.  If it's found tonight.  And the guy goes, okay.  So I cancel all my credit cards.  Because I don't hear anything.  I get a call last night. 
[01:31:30]  Because I'm going for a sleep study tonight.  So I stay up all night last night, 4 o'clock, 3.30 in the morning.  My fucking cell phone rings.  Hey, so-and-so said there's a reward for your wallet.  He goes, I found it when I was cleaning up.  And the reason I said there's a reward was because obviously somebody found it.  And they just probably kept it.  Yeah.  Trying to figure out what they could do with it.  Maybe, sure.  But I figure there's nothing of value in there for them.  So why would they keep it?  That's what a reward is for.  That's why.  Well, yeah, but if there's a cash in it, they'll keep it. 
[01:32:00]  Well, because what they would do is realize there's nothing they could do with this wallet.  And they would probably just throw it.  Throw it out.  So I wanted the reward out there.  So now it's like, wait, this thing is now worth something.  It's a good move, Jim.  Yeah, yeah.  Because that's exactly why.  Because I'm like, if somebody found it or even saw me drop it and stole it, I don't care.  So I offered $150.  But I didn't have the cash.  By the time this guy called, because I couldn't get to the ATM.  Because I canceled my fucking card.  Right.  So I had to leave a check.  But I told him, hey, I'll throw an extra $25 in for your cab. 
[01:32:30]  So I'm like, just drop it off at my building.  So I wrote a check for $175, made it out of the cash.  I'm like, here.  And I didn't meet him.  He just went and picked up my concierge, and I fucking got my wallet back.  But it saved me the trouble of going to motor vehicles and getting my insurance cards replaced.  So that makes it all worth it.  The fact that I don't have to go to fucking motor vehicles.  And I realized I canceled one of my cards.  I didn't have to cancel because it wasn't in the wallet.  And the one in here, I didn't cancel.  So I'm going to have to call them and ask if there's been any charges.  So who returned it? 
[01:33:00]  I don't know.  He just said a guy who said I was cleaning up.  I forget what his name was.  But he was just a dude who was cleaning up.  So I don't know if he worked there or if he was a patron who saw me drop it or if he was the boyfriend of a fucking one of the dancers who saw me drop it and pick it up.  I know nobody took it out of my pocket because nobody was in close enough proximity.  That's an impossibility.  Yeah, yeah.  Like I wasn't worried about being pickpocketed.  Again, just because of my phone.  It's an impossibility that that happened.  They're worried about being dickpocketed.  Reach into their pocket and fill a dick. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, that's something.  But I really laughed to myself that I was just such an asshole.  Like I fucking, I had to come and tell people I dropped my fucking wallet in a tranny bar.  In a tranny bar.  In a tranny bar.  Are there creeps in there?  No, I will be honest.  I wouldn't say that they were the greatest of citizens.  But no, they were people all just trying to hang out and look.  I was like, everybody was hanging out and sitting in these back fucking chairs trying to blend in.  And I don't know why.  I just didn't give a fuck.  I'm just kind of sitting there looking around.  And one guy, I was getting the dance. 
[01:34:00]  Johnny Cakes.  I'm sitting there.  There was an old guy with a big gut who I saw walking around.  He was really like a fucking creepy looking like social studies teacher.  And I see him in the corner chair.  Like you're in the VIP area.  And my lap dance literally was very, very mild.  It was, it was fucking me sitting there feeling a pair of fake tits while fucking, you know,  not as feminine legs as I like when we're grinding at my legs.  Oh my God.  I'll be honest. 
[01:34:30]  The lap dances were not what I wanted.  Oh my goodness.  But I look over.  They can't figure out the legs yet, huh?  Yeah, they really can't.  Oh boy.  But I look over and I see that, uh, I see one of the fucking gals standing up on the  chair and, uh, apparently face fucking the older gentleman next to me.  And I'm like, wow, this fucking gets down and dirty in here, man.  Like that just.  Wait, real face fucking?  Yeah, I don't know.  I just, I looked for a second.  I was like, ugh.  And I was kind of, I knew it was time to pack up and go.  Oh, you're starting to get a little debaucherous? 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, but it wasn't, it was like, it was too much.  It was like, I wished, I, I really wanted a fucking buddy there, uh, to enjoy this.  Yeah.  I wouldn't have given anything to have Bob Kelly there.  Bobby would have been.  I don't know if he would go, but, um.  He would go.  He might.  He might.  Oh yeah, he'd have gone.  We talked about it in Vegas.  Bobby might.  He'd have gone.  Uh, for the goof, he might go.  But, um, I went and that was it.  There you go.  That's hilarious.  And you got your wallet back.  Yeah, but I got a fucking, I, I, I'm so mad that I canceled one of the cards I didn't need  to, for Pete's sake, and now I have to call up with this one. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, panicky Pete.  Oh, of course.  Turned in his lease car.  He's just doing everything.  See, because that would be silly.  Yeah, I know.  I can't, I just gave my apartment away.  Yeah.  You mentioned, uh, Bob Kelly there.  So what, he's got a show on FX?  We're all congratulating him.  Yes.  I don't, I don't know what it is.  Is he, uh.  Oh yeah.  One of the main guys?  Yeah, I believe he has a part in, uh.  That's awesome.  It's, uh, a cop show on FX.  I don't know all the details.  It's called Bronx Warrants.  Bronx Warrants.  It's like a bunch of people that serve warrants and have to, uh, like bring people in and 
[01:36:00]  they get money for it for each person and they pay more attention to the fact that they  make money off of these people than the actual justice and of it and it's a comedy.  That's great.  And it's not a pilot?  Uh, I don't know if it is or not.  It's always a pilot first, but.  Okay.  That's still great that he got it.  He acted.  He screen tested.  Uh, Bob really worked for it.  And that's when we were in Vegas.  That's, he was losing his voice.  Oh, that's the audition?  That's what he was auditioning for.  Wow, he was really nervous about that one.  Yeah, he was.  He nailed it, man. 
[01:36:30]  Thank God.  He had, uh, you know, throat lozenges very close, very nearby in a, in a bandolier that  was around a young twink's, uh, body the entire time, young Sam.  We had, uh, Bob Kelly.  Sam had a wave on Bob Kelly hand and foot.  I actually had to run across the entire arena when we were at the UFC show.  Oh, yeah, he said that.  Just to give him a wall.  Because he texted me and said, I need a hulls.  A hulls?  Well, good for Bob Kelly, man.  I'm very happy for Bob.  He's a good actor.  Congratulations on Twitter.  Yeah, it's a great thing. 
[01:37:00]  And how about a nice congratulations without a fucking, you know, you have to spin it into  some dumb thing.  We tease each other, but I'm happy for him.  Yeah, he's very excited.  Yeah, it's a real gig.  Good for him.  When we get back, uh, we gotta get into Bloomberg's latest thing.  Every day it's something new with this guy, the mayor of New York City.  Oh, he's an ass.  Now he's going after, uh, what, baby formula?  Yep.  We'll explain next.  Then we got, um, there was something else.  Oh!  Oh, uh, the, the really bad national anthem.  Yeah, we got to play that.  And also, uh, oh, yeah, that's right. 
[01:37:30]  Jerry Jones, too, saying some weird shit yesterday.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Just heard you talking about, uh, your Yankees experience.  Oh, it was great.  And I'm a bit jealous, because I had a, I had a really just boring weekend, man. 
[01:38:00]  Did ya?  Fuck.  Man.  No fault of anyone.  It was just one of those boring weekends.  Yeah, sometimes those are good, but, uh, yeah, I had an action-packed kind of fucking weekend.  Oh, sorry, Rock.  I went out to dinner with the Rock.  Oh!  Shit!  Holy shit.  Now you're reiterating.  Honestly, we had a good dinner.  Where'd you guys go?  We went out for his, uh, wife's birthday.  We went to Quality Meats, and, um, actually, that was a good time.  Did he want to go to Quantity Meats? 
[01:38:30]  But that's only a few hours, so...  Yeah, but then guess, and guess what he did on Saturday.  What?  He went to dinner with me.  Sorry for the boring weekend.  Wow.  We had a pizza party.  Holy shit, you guys, you're just boring.  No, I...  We entertained him all weekend, and then he comes back, and I didn't do anything this whole weekend.  Are you not entertained?  Look, man, I, I, I, I had a couple meals with the guys, yes.  But besides that, it was a boring weekend.  Wow.  I liked the pizza party we had.  It was a nice restaurant in the middle of the ghetto. 
[01:39:00]  I was a little scared, and when we went to our car after we, uh, left you guys, there  was a rat that we were watching.  Yeah, you gotta watch this one.  A fucking rat.  Sam really likes this place, and the food is really good, but it's time for that business  to get the fuck out.  They've been there since, like, 1912.  It's in New Rochelle.  Well, good for them.  Modern pizza.  You know what wasn't there in 1912?  And then, uh...  Roland was with us, too.  And then his wife's, like, uh, you know, showing us all the, uh, the stray cats.  Yeah.  The stray kittens.  She goes, oh, there's, there's, there's stray kittens, uh, in this area. 
[01:39:30]  And I'm like, yeah, right.  But sure enough, we saw stray kittens.  Stray kittens, lots of Mexicans.  Like, we gotta spay and neuter.  Come on now, people.  Lots of Mexicans, lots of rats.  Yeah.  What the fuck are you, Floyd?  Where are you?  New Rochelle.  Well, do or die.  Sounds terrible.  Do or, oh, boy.  Huh?  Gangsta suburb shit.  New Rochelle, do or die.  But the joint.  I tried dying.  Was really, really good.  Like, their pasta was better than most places I go to in Manhattan.  They know what they're doing.  And I even ordered clams on the half shell. 
[01:40:00]  That's crazy.  New Rochelle.  I know.  Yeah.  I came at it with you.  They were very fresh.  They were fresh.  It's a very, very good restaurant.  Wow.  Quite famous.  Yeah.  In Westchester.  Stop.  Best Chester.  That is the best Chester.  But I mean, during the day and stuff is when, you know, I want to, like, do something.  And I was just bored.  Oh, and I saw Philip Seymour Hoffman.  I was, I, I, I.  It sounds like one of the more exciting weekends any of us could have.  Yeah.  Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Was drinking at the bar at, uh. 
[01:40:30]  What bar?  Don't say where he was.  And he won't go there.  Yeah.  True.  Yeah.  We all want to get our pictures with him.  Yeah.  We got to figure out how to do it.  I'll get him.  I want to.  Hopefully I'll see him in the place I go to next week.  Whatever tranny.  Oh, whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  In Chicago.  No, anyway, I mean, but besides the two nice meals I had, and I did have nice meals with  these guys.  Yeah.  I was just bored watching the Olympics and I was just a lump.  Well, I didn't see the opening ceremonies because I was at the Yankee game.  Well, that's what I'm getting at.  Boy, what a great fucking time. 
[01:41:00]  How great is our hookup?  Dude.  Did you meet her, too?  Yes.  She's an uber fan.  She's a big fan.  Just very cool.  Totally fucking cool.  It finally works out in our favor.  Like, we actually have someone.  I know.  That is a massive fan from what goes way back with us.  That is pretty much like George Costanza was in Seinfeld with the Yankees.  Yeah.  She doesn't even want us to say her name or nothing, man.  No, no, no.  Can I go to a game?  Yes.  Not even a problem.  So I went.  I got the Legend seating, which I have access to the restaurant area in there and everything. 
[01:41:30]  I went in and it's a whole buffet with sushi and fucking carving stations and chicken and  all.  It was amazing.  How much did it cost?  Nothing.  Oh, wow.  I want to go.  That's all free except for the beers and stuff.  They charge you for the beers.  And then I sit down at a table, nice table, and Keith Olbermann is at the table next to  me.  Keith Olbermann. 
[01:42:00]  Did you say hi to him?  And not because of his politics.  Yuck.  No, I didn't say hi to him.  I've heard that he is there.  I saw a couple of...  Are you allowed to say I've heard?  What?  I've heard he's a douchebag.  I've heard he's a douchebag from a lot of people.  And that's not because of his politics.  I've heard just he's a douchebag.  Yeah, I've heard he's a douchebag.  What the hell is that?  Oh, that's a World Series ring.  What?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was wearing...  I was trying on somebody's World Series ring.  Who was it?  Well, you know, who was I sitting next to? 
[01:42:30]  Darrell Strawberry.  That was his ring?  No, it wasn't.  With the Yankees.  Yeah, you do have a picture of Darrell Strawberry.  That was pretty impressive.  That's some guy that was just working at the Yankees stadium that came over.  He gets a ring?  Check this out.  Well, I didn't get the ring.  Well, he gets a ring.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  For giving you a salad?  I know.  I'm like, what the fuck is...  For giving me a salad?  That don't make no sense.  Look at that.  Nice spread sushi.  Some ziti.  Some chicken.  That's where you want to eat sushi.  In the South Bronx.  You know what?  It was fantastic.  It was fucking during the fourth inning. 
[01:43:00]  Great place for sushi.  I'm eating clams and a half shell and a new old shell in the ghetto.  I'm eating sushi in Yankee Stadium.  Right.  Exactly.  What's wrong with us?  But mine was good.  The food was terrific.  Ah, there's me and Darrell Strawberry.  What a great day at the park.  Yep.  And it was great weather.  The Yankees won.  Did he get the cotton candy and the peanuts and the...  No.  Cracker Jacks.  I got beers.  I love Cracker Jacks.  I got beers.  Did you care if he never came back?  I wanted to come back.  Yeah, yeah.  You didn't go for the free ice cream in the cooler? 
[01:43:30]  No, no.  I ate.  I picked out for dinner.  You don't like ice cream?  Well, I like beer.  What are you, a fucking peter pumper?  Beer doesn't go good with ice cream.  Yeah, it does.  So I ate a lot.  Ice cream goes well with everything.  And then I just went out there and I fucking just kept getting the...  The fucking waitstaff there, too.  So attentive.  Did I tell you...  The girl kept coming over.  It's like, yes, here you go.  Beep, beep, beep, beep.  And then the beers just come flying at you.  I said this when I went.  I mean, we were in a special section.  So you know they're going to treat you really nice. 
[01:44:00]  Yes.  But do you notice how everyone at Yankee Stadium is really nice to you?  Yes.  As you're walking through?  Dude, it's a whole other world.  They changed their tune.  Because you go to some of these fucking baseball parks.  It's fantastic.  Shea Stadium was horrendous.  And Yankee Stadium for the longest time.  But now everyone goes out of their way to say hello.  Make it a great experience.  Have a good night.  Drive home safely.  Enjoy the game.  And to the point where you want them to kind of shut up.  Because every single person does it now.  Was it a day game?  What time was it?  It was a night game.  7, 730. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, was it the Red Sox?  Yep.  Nice.  How'd you get there?  Like the Sox?  I actually took the subway.  Oh.  Oh, hey.  What's the matter with you?  What's the matter with you?  It's very safe, I think, to go to a Yankee game on the subway.  There's a lot of cops around.  What do you mean?  I think.  You could see.  You see the locals.  They know.  Yeah.  They've been told.  They just will not attempt anything up there.  No, no.  It's pretty wild.  Is there a way to get from the subway to the stadium pretty easy?  Yeah.  It's pretty much fenced in.  Yeah.  What they do, they let you off and you're right there.  You're in front. 
[01:45:00]  It dumps you off in front of the fucking stadium.  When you park up there, there's huge 20, 25 foot fences.  Yeah.  That you park in and then it's almost like a corral to the stadium.  Fucking fenced in.  Oh, yeah.  She already wrote.  Yeah, Jimmy.  She already wrote.  Yeah.  I just want to go to sing the seventh inning stretch.  I like to sing that.  Take me out to the ballgame.  They do YMCA.  Oh.  They do YMCA.  The grounds crew comes out and does their little YMCA.  No ice cream, no cotton candy, no peanuts.  What do you eat?  No, I do like when you leave, there's a giant fucking whole counter of just candy everywhere. 
[01:45:30]  And you just grab it.  Grab whatever you want.  It's free.  I'd take all of it.  I'd start going, yay, yay, yay.  How embarrassing you'd be.  Yay.  Yay.  More for me.  I was yelling yay.  Where was the candy table?  Candy was like when you leave the restaurant.  Oh, this was at Legends.  Yeah.  You see a sign that's a CT with an arrow on it.  No, I didn't do the Legends thing.  I'm talking about the little fucking cave you get. 
[01:46:00]  Where you get your beers and all that.  I want tickets for the series.  I need 17.  I need 17 for the series.  17 tickets for the series.  Or we'll blow up your spot.  Yeah.  Get that done.  Yeah.  17 tickets for the series.  And I want to go in the dugout and sit with Joe G.  And his adult braces.  It was just a great fucking time.  Oh, my God.  That sounds fun.  I want to go to a ball game.  Eat a hot dog.  The weather was great.  It was fucking the Yankees.  The stadium was amazing. 
[01:46:30]  Holy fuck.  Had some good fucking action.  Some chick almost got nailed with a baseball.  Like two people next to me.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, we were right on the third baseline.  And, man, almost took our fucking head off.  I would bring a glove.  And every pitch, I would just start jumping and going,  Hit it to me!  How embarrassing.  Could you please do that?  Would you be embarrassed?  Hit it to me!  I would love it.  And, oh, yes.  Come on, then.  Pitch, hit it to me!  Over and over again? 
[01:47:00]  In every pitch, I would be pounding my glove and my hand together.  Oh, my God.  And then I'd go up and I'd scoop candy into the glove and go like,  Yay!  More candy for me!  Yeah.  When I got done with the Yankee game, it was for Friday night.  It's still pretty early.  So I decided I'm going to go down to Iggy's over there on the east side  and do some drinking and some karaoke. 
[01:47:30]  What's Iggy's?  How did you know about Iggy's?  I've been there before.  I've been there.  It's like one of the best karaoke plays in New York.  Packs out.  Total great selection.  Everything.  That's on my way.  I saw a gentleman being arrested.  So I just got in the middle of the fray and put my thumb up and took a picture.  The guy's handcuffed against the wall looking at me.  Which guy's getting arrested?  The guy with the hands behind the back.  Oh, right there.  Yeah.  Okay.  No, there's a lot going on in that photo.  Yeah, a lot of cops.  The one not in the police uniform.  It was Anthony, 30 cops, and one guy with his handcuffs. 
[01:48:00]  Yes.  Yeah.  I don't know if he was a detective.  That was pretty good.  I don't know.  And then went to Iggy's.  Had a pisser.  You know, fucking warbling out some tunes.  A lot of drunk people there.  It was great.  And then Sirius XM's own Mark Zito.  Who is he now?  Who is he?  That's Mark Zito's chick.  We did a duet.  She's cute.  At the end of the night.  He's the one who ruined Spider-Man for you and then refused to apologize. 
[01:48:30]  How did he ruin Spider-Man?  Who is he?  Because he asked an asinine question about how stupid Spider-Man.  Just a dumb, hacky question about how.  What's the question?  How does Spider-Man.  I don't say I'm going to ruin it.  How does Spider-Man all of a sudden learn how to make his own costume?  Oh, that was some stranger at the movie that I went to.  He's Mark Zito.  That's Mark Zito.  Yeah, he works here.  How long has he been around?  A couple years.  Not much of an impact, huh?  Yeah, well. 
[01:49:00]  I swear if there was a lineup, I wouldn't be able to pick him out.  I'm not even joking.  He just came in.  I had no idea.  I don't know if he could.  See, I tweeted.  This was weird.  I tweeted that I was there, and then he kind of showed up.  Oh, my God.  And he is that type of guy, too.  Yeah, because he's like, oh, look who's at one of my neighborhood bars.  Like, he lives in the area, I guess.  But did he make believe that he didn't read your tweet and all that?  Yeah, yeah.  Did he walk in like Fredo, all happy to see it?  Yeah, da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Yeah.  So I'm thinking he might have put one of those where he read that I was there, and then, 
[01:49:30]  oh, he shows up.  What a little ass kiss.  Oh, yeah.  It was a little awkward.  He knew, too, as soon as you saw him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then there was this fucking, there was this obnoxious, drunk old broad, and she's  like, she's trying to sing like Lady Gaga and be like hip, you know, sing one of the  newer tunes.  And then I get done with the song, and I come down off a little stage there to grab my beer, 
[01:50:00]  and she just grabs my arm, and she's like, oh, you're very good, and she wouldn't let  go of my fucking arm.  I'm trying to get away.  I'm like, oh, thanks, and I'm trying to get away, and she's just fucking holding on to  me.  Why didn't you give her a little?  Like Uncle Leo.  She gave her a little.  No.  She was looking for a little.  Ugh.  Disgusting.  She obviously was looking for a little.  No.  Why wouldn't you give her a little?  Why would I?  Was she really bad?  I'm not going to fucking, yes, she was terrible.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  It was, uh, yeah. 
[01:50:30]  She was just awful.  Look at your face.  Oh, I'm trying to think of, like, but I can't even think of something that awful.  The idea of even fucking talking to her was bad enough.  That sounds like a good weekend.  Yeah, it was pretty cool, and I, you know, I went home, and, uh, you know, that was that.  Do you ever have a song stuck in your head incessantly?  Which one for you?  It wasn't, it was not a, it's an Uncle Paul song that apparently he was saying when he was  a kid, and it was, it was, it wouldn't stop. 
[01:51:00]  What do you mean apparently he would sing?  Did you make this up over the weekend?  Did you make it believe?  No, it was just there.  It's just there.  He just said apparently Uncle Paul would sing this as if it was, as if Uncle Paul.  We all know what his character is based on.  We don't have to.  Oh, no.  That obvious.  We just all, like, go with it, Sam.  It's not even a long one.  The Jim Norton flowchart?  Oh, yeah.  The flowchart.  What's the song?  It's just silly.  Why do you make us beg?  But I kept thinking it. 
[01:51:30]  He makes us beg for shit.  He wants us to go, please, can we hear it?  I know, please.  All right.  Sure.  Oh, no.  It's really not good, though.  And Uncle Paul used to sing this to you when you were growing up?  No, he would sing it to him when he was a kid.  Oh, oh.  When Uncle Paul was a kid, back whenever that was, many years ago, he would try to, he would  just go, say, hey, what do you say?  Give me a nickel.  That doesn't even make any sense. 
[01:52:00]  What do you want a nickel for?  Wait, wait, what is that?  Why does he need a nickel?  Say, hey, what do you say?  Give me a nickel.  I don't like it at all.  I don't like the end part.  Give me a nickel.  Give me a nickel.  Yeah, it does.  I don't like that.  Yeah, it does.  It's very abrupt.  It doesn't have any, like, real...  Why would he sing that?  I don't know, but he never told you.  Why would that have bounced in my head?  And why is it say, hey, what do you say, not hey, hey, what do you say? 
[01:52:30]  Exactly.  Good question, and I don't know.  Can you say, say twice?  Oh, I know.  Say, hey, what do you say?  Give me a nickel.  I don't know what it means.  I don't either.  It's so bad.  Oh, it's so annoying.  It's terrible.  I don't like it at all.  You don't have to come up with more words for that.  You don't like it less when it's fucking, when it's the 400th time you just catch yourself  at the refrigerator looking at Weight Watchers ice cream.  Say, hey, what do you say?  Give me a nickel.  Why am I saying this? 
[01:53:00]  I'm alone.  I was, I was all, no matter what I was doing, fucking, as I'm undoing my belt to drop a shit,  say, hey, plop, plop, what do you say?  Wipe it.  Give me a nickel.  I told you when Marvin would say stop and plop instead of stop and shop, I would fucking,  I would give it an 11 every time.  Marvin rules.  I've never met him, but.  Marvin's the best, man.  I would howl.  I love your Marvin stories.  Oh, God damn. 
[01:53:30]  And did you hit on the girls you don't brought at all?  Uh, did I hit on her?  Like flirt with her at all?  No.  I just thought that would have been funny if you had.  What do it?  No, I was being respectful of anybody, you know.  Is that an actual chick?  What song are you going to hit on?  I think it was the, the band, The Weight.  Take your lower.  Yeah.  She picked it, you know.  That's a good song.  I know what song I'd have sung.  What?  Say, hey, what do you say?  Give me a nickel. 
[01:54:00]  What are you talking about?  Like, uh, speaking of bad singing, uh, we gotta do the National Anthem thing.  Oh, yes.  Went viral over the weekend.  I guess she's 11.  But that doesn't excuse her.  Excuse her.  What was that?  A soccer game?  Yeah, I did a, uh, uh, major league soccer game.  It, uh, I, I listened to this.  It's so long.  Yeah.  It takes forever.  Yeah.  And it seems twice as long as it is anyway.  Yeah.  I don't think it's supposed to take this long.  No, no. 
[01:54:30]  To sing the National Anthem.  Put the video up on our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony, please.  And the, terrible.  The 11-year-old is credited as a singer-songwriter.  Oh, stop it.  Which is why it's okay to critique.  Yeah, yeah.  You know?  And, and you know what?  Well, who thought it would be a good idea to have her sing?  I did.  Doesn't she have to put an audition tape in or something?  You'd think, like, they would have heard her before just going, yeah, go up there.  Like, isn't there a rehearsal where they go, oh, look, could you speed it up a little?  You know what?  She might have got fucked up by that echo shit that happens. 
[01:55:00]  I've been fucked up all the years by that.  No, you can tell this chick just can't hold a note.  You say something and then the stadium hears it five seconds later?  Yeah.  What the fuck is that about?  Yeah, it's pretty weird.  What did that happen to us?  We had to do something.  I don't remember.  The first thing I thought of was probably in an empty room somewhere.  First time I ever heard my voice.  Safe but true.  First time I ever heard my voice back.  Bouncing back?  Dude, it was, it was in a small room, but it was, uh.  Oh, it might have been on the.  It was weird to hear.  The first time you hear your voice on a microphone is a weird fucking thing. 
[01:55:30]  It might have been on some of those virus shows.  Yeah.  You bounce them back.  Huh.  It fucking comes out of, yeah, it comes back at you like a second later.  Just enough to really, really fuck you up.  You know how bad you have to be that, like, for an 11-year-old who you'd give a lot of  fucking leeway to singing in front of a crowd, the national anthem, how bad do you have to  be to be like, oh, shut up?  My favorite is the reaction shots.  Oh, yeah.  They go to the audience.  They go to, yeah. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, the crowd is just like looking.  They go to the crowd, and they're looking around like, is this a goof?  Yeah, they look around, they look down, they look over at their friends and kind of  put their eyebrows up and look away.  Like, wait, what's going on here?  Why don't we play the video so we can see that sound?  Yeah.  We'll go to you now, and it'll be on our Facebook page if you haven't seen it yourself yet.  Sure.  She's very good.  And please welcome 11-year-old singer-songwriter from Coppell, Texas, Harper Grusens, in the  performance of our national anthem.  I'll see a songwriter. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, say, can you see by the dawn's early light?  What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming? 
[01:57:00]  Oh, say, can you see by the dawn's early light?  Wow.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:57:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  What's that?  Oh?  Oh.  No.  What?  What?  Don't you see, Philippa.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  No.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Hold on to your hats.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:58:00]  Oh.  Come on.  Oh.  Oh.  Whoa.  Gave proof through the night  That our flag was still there  This is going great  Oh, say does that star spangled 
[01:58:30]  Banned way  O-M-G  In the land of the free  In the land of the brave 
[01:59:00]  Well, how about that away  to set the scene tonight?  Biggest game of the season for him?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Aw.  So, isn't this great?  Mighty only one with a raging hot on  By the way, the one part she got right  was the hardest part  Yeah, yeah, yeah  And the record  I love how she went 
[01:59:30]  The bombs burst  The bombs burst  I like that part  I actually really like that one part of the song  The rest of it is terrible  I think  Did you play that part again?  Just zip through it?  There might have been a problem  because she had to start so low  in order to do the high part  So she might have been fucked up  I like that one point  Let's hear that  No? Mike?  Turn the volume up  Turn the volume up  No, rewind a little bit, Sam  before I fucking pull your hair 
[02:00:00]  I love that  She's hurting her throat, too  The bombs bursting  Yeah  Who is she? 
[02:00:30]  I don't know  She's a singer-songwriter  She didn't write it  I'm sorry I did that  We have any other examples  I'm embarrassed that I did that  Do you have any other examples of her singing?  Yeah  Oh, is there?  Let's see  Kids start doing Say Hey  Let's Say Hey  Oh, what's this?  Hi, my name is Harper Lucis  And I am 10 years old  I'm from Rockville, Texas  The song I'm going to be singing  is Beautiful by Justine Agatha 
[02:01:00]  Uh-oh  She's playing the piano  Alright  Every day is so wonderful  Where is she performing?  Why don't they turn her vocals up?  Why don't they record it through the board?  The whole operation stinks  This isn't as bad 
[02:01:30]  She's still a little off  A little pitchy  Yeah  Yeah, she really can't hold a note very well  This is definitely better  She sings like a 
[02:02:00]  Like a bird  It's like  It's like bird wings have lyrics on them  and they're dripping into my ears  She's extremely mediocre  Yeah  She probably has very rich parents  Yeah, definitely  Yeah  Definitely  Who have influence in that shitty soccer game  And they're like  We'd like our little girl to sing the national anthem  Yeah, from Texas  She's sassy  She has a hat 
[02:02:30]  And she can really  She's swashbuckles  She got her little hands on her hips  We didn't learn nothing from JonBenet Ramsey  No kidding  With the pursed lips  Yeah  We took the JonBenet model  and we said  Now you're going to sing  and you're going to stand like that  We improved on it  We improved on it  She can't hit notes worth a shit  But she sits there on that Casio  and she'll make noise all goddamn day 
[02:03:00]  You can tell with an eating disorder  she might be like Charlene Tilton  Oh, God  Have two or three good years  and then just explode  Charlene Tilton  Charlene Tilton  Charlene Tilton was like  She was alright for like a couple of years  During Dallas  She was cute  Yeah, yeah  And then, wow  Have I seen her now?  I haven't thought of that name  since I was eating the ass  of Ken Kerchevel  Is that the wrong name? 
[02:03:30]  I don't remember  Whatever his name was  Was it Ken Kerchevel?  Ken Kerchevel  He was uh  He was like the fucking uh  Whoa  Wow, what a fucking  Whoa, what happened?  Yeah, yeah  She looks like Paul Williams in 1978  Yes, she really does  Her face is alright  But it looks like she probably had a little face worth  She got giant  Yeah, Charlene Tilton  So  Over the one  Down, down, down one  Down  No, over  No, over to the right  No, down  Down there 
[02:04:00]  Yes, that one  Right?  See, look at that  She was fucking  Oh yeah  Pretty hot right there  She was a sex symbol in the late 70s  Yes  She was  And then  Did they make her lose all that weight?  I think  What's her story, right?  I remember  She wasn't supposed to look like that probably  The scuffle butt back then was that  Yeah, in order to stay on Dallas  They find you if you gained weight or something  They made sure she stayed thin  And she ended up having some kind of eating disorder  Didn't do her very good though  Because she was never skinny 
[02:04:30]  She looks like Cindy Lauper in a few of those pictures  Oh yeah  Got big boobies  Well, she has the giant tits  She's got the big boobies  Yeah  Mm-hmm  Charlene Tilton  Yeah  Hey, we got a  Oh, well  What do we got there?  Oh  See, she's very hippie right there  Yeah, you can tell there's  Yeah  Room for  Big  Growth  Big fucking bush under those undies, I betcha  Right?  No doubt  Big Charlene Tilton  Fucking hairy bush 
[02:05:00]  Yup  Yeah  Big fucking  Fucking matted down  Pressed flat  Yeah  Because of the panties  Looks like someone just cut off mutton chops  And threw them in their underwear  And put these on quickly  That was always good  With sex with the old days  You took the panties off  And you had to re-fluff the pussy hair  Because it was just kind of  Fucking pressed in their pants  And panties all day  That it was flattened out  It was  It looks like the grass after Lollapalooza's done  And smells like it 
[02:05:30]  So you had to get in there  With a little mud coming through  Yeah, you got to kind of fluff it with your fingers a little  That's hilarious  Did you actually do that?  Foof  I don't remember if I ever did that  Oh, you had to fluff  Re-fluff  Oh, that's really funny  But you couldn't make it like you were re-fluffing  You had to make it like you were plasuring her  With the fluffing technique  I think the women just teased it up again  When you weren't looking  Maybe  Run their fingers through it or something  I would always rub their head like 
[02:06:00]  Like Ted Knight was doing  When he said, how about a fresca?  That's how I rub a girl's pussy  When her hair's all matted  Hey  Like a tussle  Hey, we got a NASCAR guy  And he  What?  And he forgot who he was doing the broadcast with  It's a quick little fun little dumb clip  Oh, yeah  You want to hear it?  What the fuck is that?  It's Marty Reed  And as we come inside our broadcast position  Hello again, everybody  Marty Reed alongside  Winning brickyard driver  Dale Jarrett  Winning brickyard crew chief  I know who you are  And I think it's great to see you

[02:07:30]  You said that it was coming back  Um  No  No  Not coming back  Maybe some of the girls are just lazy  Can I tell you that I don't like hairy pussies?

[02:10:00]  That's not my thing either  That's got to go  It goes completely around the whole pussy  Yeah, not my thing either  Ah, that's brilliant  I don't like hairy legs either  No, no  I like a shaved pussy  But I like her pussy is big  And I think she's pretty  I wouldn't mind smooching with her  And touching her asshole  If it's cleaned up  I don't mind it either way  Didn't we say yes to Huey Lewis  Or did we forget to say yes?  I think it's coming in at 9  No  15  Well, I mean no  What do you mean no?  Did you see the email that Rowan sent out?  No  We said yes to him  And he said to Huey at 9.15 
[02:10:30]  I don't read  What happened  Over the weekend  Rowan sent an email  That he had to  He said he had to reschedule  Why?  As he's doing TV right now?  He's taking what they're giving  Because he's working for a living  Well, why did he have to  We like Huey Lewis  He comes in there once in a while  So what happened?

Yeah  Just watching Huey Lewis up there  That's pretty good  That's the whole song?  That's the whole song  What's wrong with him?  But that's the theme song from Extras  I just love that 
[02:13:00]  That song's like a minute long  Fuck, I loved when a Huey Lewis video came on  Beavis and Butthead years ago  Like  Uh  Are these friends of my dad's?  That's 20 years ago  I know  Huey Lewis  Friends of my dad's  Some people just look old  We've said this a million times  But they look old  And then never age from that point  Right  He doesn't look like he's aged that much  No, no  In 20 years  He looks good  Yeah, this was yesterday afternoon  The email went out  Huey Lewis has to reschedule now 
[02:13:30]  He's not tomorrow  Oh, see  Oh, wow, wow  Guess what?  Well, fuck me running  And we're not rescheduling him  You're not gonna have him back?  Nope  He had one shot at it  He blew you up  Maybe he's having tea with Tillerman  No  I don't want a coffee with Tillerman  I'd fuck the whole song up  Jesus  Jesus  I'm not right  Fuck the whole  Yeah  Call Tillerman  Tell him I want coffee  I want some fucking Sanka  My mother used to drink Sanka 
[02:14:00]  Oh, did she?  It would stain her dentures  She'd say, Chipper  Get me some hot water and some Sanka  Sanka  Sanka  Drink Sanka  My mother loves Sanka  Sanka  She would drink cup after cup of Sanka  She'd get a headache and have to take Anacin  One time she said Sanka  I said, you're welcome  She slapped me in the face  And said, don't do that wordplay shit with me, Chipper 
[02:14:30]  I guess that didn't help  Yeah, spit out my gobstopper  I had a gobstopper  It rolled under the refrigerator and got cat hair on it  Did you find it?

[02:16:30]  But people kept saying  You look like a fucking asshole  So I put the mustache on  Now I can't fucking breathe  How old are you?

Chipp, chipperson on the scene  Chipp, chipperson on the scene 
[02:17:00]  Yeah  Three seconds  The Opinion Three Show  Speaking of guns and violence  A couple weird incidences  Violence  In New York City over the weekend, huh?  Yeah, I don't know how this happened  Wait, is this  Doesn't make any sense  Is this one the gun-carrying man in the grocery store?  Is that New York?  Or somewhere else?  Which one was this?  That might be somewhere else  I'm thinking of  Somewhere else  I'm thinking of the pack of women that attacked the Vietnam vet 
[02:17:30]  Right  On the subway  There was no guns involved in that one  But basically they're acting up  The jibber jabbering  And this Vietnam vet  They didn't know at the time  But you shouldn't stab people in general  Yeah  Pretty much said, you know  Could you guys knock it off?  Chill  Yeah  Shut the fuck up  And these women  And they look scary as shit  Let me see them  They all attacked the Vietnam vet  And ended up stabbing them, right? 
[02:18:00]  Yes  What do you get?  They stabbed them in the shoulder  In the shoulder?  Some shit  Yeah  Who are these ladies?  Who are these ladies?  I don't know  Who's that last one in line there?  Yeah  Oh yeah, she's alright  Is that a see-through top there?  They look  I see a black chick  And a few Hispanic chicks  Where were they coming from?  White girl  Anyone else?  Anyone have anything else?  I don't think there's any white girl  Is that girl on the front line?  No, I think that's Hispanic  Look, and they're all about being arrested  They're like  Yes  Showboning for the cameras 
[02:18:30]  And laughing  Like it's no big deal  They must be under the tutelage of someone  Tutelage  Oh no, the other one's Salt Lake City  Which we'll get into in a second  You never get to see  What do you know, Sam?  Any other details on this?  They're just cunts  How late was it?  What train?  Why did the guy  It's a six train  And it was early Sunday morning  Meaning very late Saturday night  So everyone was all fucked up and shit  It was zood it  I would imagine 
[02:19:00]  Zood it  Yeah, and then this guy just told them  You know, hey, knock it off  Right  Keep your voices down  Right  And they started getting on him  And then one pulled out a knife  And stabbed him  He said, those girls on the train  He said to somebody  Those girls must be retarded  Because they can't hear each other talk  Oh  Because they were being so loud  At which point  The furious gals  Went berserk  And started pummeling him with their fists  And then while he was blocking them 
[02:19:30]  Somebody said, go for him  Cut him  So they stabbed him  Jesus Christ  Wow  They are ranging in age from 15 to 20  Of course  That's good  There you go  Parenting skills there  Yeah  Really bringing them up quite nicely  Yeah  And then there was, I guess, six people  Shot in Brooklyn, yo  Well, that's impossible  Because we have gun laws  Yeah  I don't know  I think the story's fake 
[02:20:00]  It has to be, right?  It's a fake story  Because there's no way anyone could shoot anyone in Brooklyn  Because the guns are illegal to have  You can't carry around a gun in Brooklyn like that  It just shows there's too many guns on the street, Anthony  Well, they're illegal, though  So you can't use them  So if you make them all illegal  Well, I guess that won't work either  Shit, what do we do?  I don't know what we do  I really don't know anymore  It's a human issue 
[02:20:30]  It's a human problem  Not a gun problem  People are fucking ridiculous  Oh, these people  Who are these people?  I heard a two-year-old got shot in the leg  Yeah  She shot first, though  It's revenge  Bad kid  She's in charge of the whole operation  Yeah, it was, you know  Some drive-by gang bullshit  And for some reason  I mean, these guys even know that this shit happens  That these kids get hit  Because you would think they'd be real careful 
[02:21:00]  After the last kid got hit  Like, ah, motherfucker  Don't be hitting no child  Most of them are not  I mean, two is really young  But most of the gangbangers  Or a lot of them are 16 and 17  Youth doesn't mean anything to them  Because they were just there  No, but, like, two?  No, no, no  But, you know, of course  That's way young  Five, something like that, yeah  But, like, ten years old  Twelve years old  Those are the people  Who are not that much younger than them  You think, like, if you're just  Shooting out a window  You gotta know  Someone's gonna get hit  That doesn't have anything  To do with something  Yeah  You know, it's just  There's no regard for human life 
[02:21:30]  Whatsoever  If it goes flying down a street  Or something  You don't know  Yeah  You don't know where it's going  It's a bullet  Yeah  It's a fucking bullet  Maybe ricochets off a few things  Yeah, yeah  A little ricochet rabbit  Type action  I know, it's always  It can't become  The same predicament  As my child  My child  Ariana was hit  Along with her 25-year-old father  I mean, I know what happens  In the area often  But when it happens  To your immediate family  You want and expect  Something like this to happen  Law enforcement sources  Say a total of six people  Were shot around seven 
[02:22:00]  In the evening  Near this Brownsville intersection  The injuries are not  Life-threatening  But the range  In victims' ages  Covers an entire generation  Of young people  From a two-year-old girl  Grazed in the leg  To a 13-year-old boy  Shot in the hand  Another teenager  And three men in their 20s  Were hit in the leg and back  Jeez  That's one bullet  Amazing  And that's becoming  A serious problem  In our community  I guess nowadays  You never know  Where you could be here  There's a problem 
[02:22:30]  She'll take Bodie  From The Wire  She kind of does  Yeah, she's got them eyes  Well, then you got a guy  With a gun  And he took care of a situation  TCB, motherfucker  In Salt Lake City  Yeah, taking care of business  Hysteria  At a Smith's  In downtown Salt Lake City  This evening  A man with a knife  Stabs two people  Inside the grocery store  Another man with a gun  Plays cops  He stops  The gunman  Or rather  The knife-wielding man 
[02:23:00]  From hurting  More innocent people  It was breaking news  That we first reported  At six  And now  The night team's  Don Hudson  Joins us live  In Salt Lake City  With more on this  Real-life drama  Don?  Yeah  Here's what you first reported  A shithead  Police say the suspect  Purchased a knife  Inside the downtown Smith's store  And then turned it  Into a weapon  He bodged it  And starts  Stabbing people  Right outside the Smith's  Right in between the foyer  And just started  Stabbing people  Yelling  You killed my people  You killed my people  But in seconds 
[02:23:30]  The knife-wielding man  Seriously injured  Two people  There was blood all over  One got stabbed in his stomach  And one  He got stabbed in his head  And he held his hands  He got stabbed all over his arms  Ow  Before the suspect  Could find another victim  A citizen with a gun  Stopped the madness  Nice  A guy pulled a gun on him  And told him  To drop his weapon  Or he would shoot him  So he dropped his weapon  And then the people  From Smith's got him  And officers had high praise  For the gun-carrying man  Who ended the hysteria  This was a really volatile situation  That could have gotten even worse 
[02:24:00]  I mean we can only assume  That judging from what we saw  It could have gotten a lot worse  So he was definitely  In the right place  At the right time  So guns good in this situation  Guns good  Guns good in this  Of course  That's two crimes  That were stopped  By guys with guns  The water polo hats  Helmets  Whatever the fuck  You want to call them  Yeah two guys so far  Just recently  And it happens all the time  I get what they call  American Rifleman  From the NRA every month  And there's a whole section 
[02:24:30]  In the front of the magazine  Of stories where  Crimes were thwarted  By people with legal guns  And there's a lot of them  It happens all the fucking time  They're just very under-reported  Well it's not sensational  No because it's not sensational  Is that why they don't report it?  And I honestly think  That the predominantly  Left-leaning media  Just doesn't  Think it's worthy  Of you know  Showing  They'd rather show  All the bad things  That happen  Not the millions  And millions  And millions  Of people that own guns  That have no problems 
[02:25:00]  With them  Yeah  Can they hear  When they put those  Water polo helmets on  No idea  So weird  Well how do they  When they say  He keeps guys yelling  You killed my people  They killed my people  What's this guy look like?  Was he an Indian  Or was he an Arab  Or was he black?  Wouldn't you think  They would let you know  What's that mean?  What does it mean?  Who was it?  Who are his people?  Mike in Atlanta  Picked up on the fact  Mike!  They just said  He bought a knife  And then turned it 
[02:25:30]  Into a weapon  Oh  I guess it's just a knife  Until you turn it  Into a weapon  Yeah  Until you turn it  Into a weapon  Like that  What is it beforehand?  Just a cheese killer?  A cheese killer  I don't know  What you're trying  To say Mike  What was the knife  Before that?  It's been a weapon  Since it came off  That assembly line  It is pretty interesting  That he just buys it  And goes like  Thank you  Just starts stabbing people  What was it before that?  A mustard spreader?  Ah  Could have been  Is there background  Checks on knives?  No  There never will be 
[02:26:00]  There's some scary  Knives out there too though  Very frightening knives  And such  Yeah  I guess  Justice  What's his name?  Scalia  Scalia  Scalia  Scalia  Justice Scalia  Scalia  You rube  Yeah  Oh she was talking  About the second amendment  Or is it a guy?  He's a concern  It's a he  He was talking about  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah he was talking about  Antonin Scalia  Is he basically saying  There's wiggle room  With that second amendment?  That's what he was saying  Pretty much 
[02:26:30]  Is that  They could take weapons  That are these horrific  Kind of weapons  And like they did  Even in the forefathers days  Regulate those  Assault rifles?  No  See that's just it  And what guns did they regulate  Back in the day?  Well they didn't  But it was things like  It was horrid weapons  Now say  The example they used  On the news  Can you break it down further?  I'm a little confused  Yeah the example  They used on the news  The founding fathers I mean  Yeah  That's the rule they had  Was that if you're 
[02:27:00]  Walking down the street  With a giant  Beheading battle axe  That was a crime  Did they have that back then?  Yeah  But you couldn't do it  Because it was like this  It was considered  A very horrifying weapon  Gotcha  So those were illegal  Back then?  Yeah  You couldn't just  Trot around the street with it  Was it part of the amendment?  I don't think so  No  But why does the NRA  Act like they don't understand  Like when they quote  The constitution  Yeah  Knowing that  Like I didn't know that  But they obviously do  And knowing that there were limits 
[02:27:30]  And Scalia is a conservative  He's as conservative as you get  So if he's saying that  That's a big deal  And what limits though?  That's just it  That's the hardest part  With this whole thing  Where's the line?  What limits?  Because that's where people  Just do not agree  But a battle axe  Could kill one or two people  At a time  Like one  And they didn't want that being used  It wasn't  No  It wasn't so much  For the idea  That it could kill  It was the idea  That it was a terrifying device  Okay  So they don't 
[02:28:00]  It's all relative though  What's terrifying  If they had a gun  That could shoot  Forty people  In ten seconds  They would probably  Have considered  That a  Like whatever  Perhaps  A terrifying device  Is relative  I mean whatever  It really is  I mean  Someone could say  Any gun is a terrifying device  Right  But I don't think  Even the forefathers  Meant it that way  Sure  I think they meant  An item of intimidation  Something horrific  Like a battle axe 
[02:28:30]  Something that  You know  You could disembowel someone with  A device that perhaps  You stab someone in the stomach  And blades fly out  And then when you pull  Their intestines are ripped out of their  They had one of those?  Oh I'm sure  They had all kinds of goodies like that  You must have looked like a complete asshole  Walking around with a battle axe  Exactly  An old lady over your shoulder  Just walking down the street  With one of those?  Could you get an image  Of a battle axe?  Battle axe  So I don't think  What they meant  Was the fact that  It just kills you 
[02:29:00]  I think it was that  Terroristic  Image  The constitution aside  Anthony Cumia  Yeah  How would the  Founding fathers feel today  If they were alive  About all this?  They were all for  Fucking guns  And for the  The prime reason  Is to  You think they would be  For to this level?  Yes  You really do  I do  To fight tyranny  And as  As the government's weaponry  Got better  The civilians' weaponry  Would have to get better also  To defend 
[02:29:30]  Their biggest gripe  Was that  The government  Will turn tyrannical  If not  For fear of the people  Don't forget though  This was a newly formed government too  Like they were coming from England  Escaping  Some shit  A tyrannical  How do you say it?  Tyrannical?  Tyrannical?  Yeah tyrannical government  And they just  Wanted to make sure  That never happened again  Yeah but at that time  They were just  Coming  Coming out of that  So it's like  It's  They may feel differently  400 or 300 years later 
[02:30:00]  Where it is now  Our government  Which look  Can display tyranny  But isn't  What they were worried about  What they were worried about  Was mostly  You know  What they were leaving  Everything that  These forefathers did  If you want to speculate  As to what they would think  Now  Again  That's all speculation  What we have to look at  Are the facts  The things that they  Absolutely  Saw as absolutes  And one of those  Is your freedom of speech  The other one  Is the right to bear arms 
[02:30:30]  As far as  The best way to fight  Tyranny  And fight a government  That is out of control  A lot of people  See that as being  Very antiquated right now  Because how could  We fight against  Tanks and missiles  And drones  And everything  And yeah that's true  But you know what  That's all we got  Yeah but I  I do think  The way they thought  Matters  Like  Their mindset  Means something  But that's interpretation  Exactly 
[02:31:00]  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  But I mean  There's the interpretation  As to what they thought  What they would have been thinking  And  What they did  And what they put in place  And the quotes that they had  That transcend the time  That's gone by  That mean  Just one thing  Hey  You have the right  To defend yourself  And the right to  Bear arms against  A government that decides  They want to  Rule over you  But do they say anything 
[02:31:30]  Do they say anything  In the constitution  The forefathers  Hmm  Like  Along the lines of  You have the right  To bear arms  And there is no limit  To the arms you can bear  Or no one can have any say  On the type of arms you can bear  Or do they kind of assume  That there would be  Some kind of a common sense balance  Because again  If they were ruling out battle action  They obviously had some limits in mind  They weren't limitless 
[02:32:00]  Or they wouldn't have put that in  But the limits are more based on  The same lines as  Cruel and inhuman punishment  Like  Yeah you could carry a weapon around  Because you have that right  To bear arms  You don't have the right  To terrify people  By walking around  With a battle axe  Just as they can regulate  You don't have the right  To walk down  The city street  With a rifle 
[02:32:30]  It would scare the shit  Out of a lot of people  You can't do that  And by the way  You can't do that  Right  So  There are regulations like that  As far as  Carrying a concealed weapon  Where's  Where's the criteria  To limit that  Based on  What the forefathers  Might have thought  Where's your line with guns  My lines  I do like the idea  When does it get too much for you  Because I think everyone  Kind of like 
[02:33:00]  Well no  I do like the idea  Of background checks  Everything I agree with  Would not have stopped  This douche bag  From getting guns  By the way  Right  We all know that  By now  Because he  He was that weird case  Where there was not really  Any  Any problems  And  And  If he was buying a gun  He had to have lied  About some kind of  Psychiatric problems  So again  He did lie then  But do you have a line  Like  I have a line  More powerful guns  Like where are you at  I like the idea 
[02:33:30]  That people have to get  A background check  As far as  Availability  Of arms  The rules that are in place  Right now  Are pretty good  For New York  Well  For New York  For most states  There are some other states  We've heard from  Some of these states  Where they say  Wow it is  Ridiculously easy  To get  You know  A gun  I would like to be able  To own  Automatic weapons  I would love to be able  To own  A Thompson  Machine gun  A fucking  MP5  Take it down  To the range  To just rattle out  Rounds  These are not used 
[02:34:00]  In crimes  They're just not  Why can't they just  Rent that shit  Out of range  You can't rent anything  No I understand that  Can you rent  Powerful guns  Elsewhere  Out in Vegas  Yeah  You could do that  That would be kind of cool  To be able to go down  The range  And shoot some shit  That's illegal  It's nice to drive  Your friend's fucking  Ferrari  Would you rather own it  Yeah  I kind of would  Oh come on now  Well you're a gun owner  No I mean I would  I would  I would answer no  But I would love to  Try out some of that shit  I'd love to own it 
[02:34:30]  Why though  Because then it's your  Fucking cool ass car  And it would be  My cool ass gun  Yeah I own a Desert Eagle  It's a 50 caliber pistol  No practical purpose  Whatsoever  Right  It's not made for  Home defense  It's not practical  For hunting  Or anything else  Aside from  The fact that  I have the means  I'm able to get it  To take it down  To the range  And fire it  And enjoy the  Fun of shooting  Something that  That insane  Yeah I don't know  I would love to fire 
[02:35:00]  Something like that  I just don't  I wouldn't need to  Own it myself  I'm sure there's a ton  Of people out there  That would love to own it  I like owning it too  I get it  I like owning  I like being able to  You know  Look at a selection  Of the guns  When I'm going to the range  And go  Yeah I'll take that one today  Yeah this one's  Going to be  I like this one  But did they have  The randomness  Of the shootings  That we have  Like don't forget  The forefathers  They didn't have  Crystal balls  Like they would duel  Yeah brass balls  My friend  They would take  Steps and duel 
[02:35:30]  Who the fuck  Would obey the rules  Of dueling by the way  Yeah  That's crazy  I think if you  Look through history  There's always been  Fucking real  Crazy people  That have killed  In crazy  Ways  And mass murders  And maybe more  Serial killing  Than mass murders  But  Jack the Ripper  Did six people  For the years  I believe it was  Six people he killed  Can you look that up  He was the guy  For 200 years  Yeah  Six 
[02:36:00]  But then there were  You know  I could be wrong  About that by the way  So  Watch it be 78  In one weekend  He's credited  Five  And then some  That he could have  Or couldn't have  But five is the number  That he's specifically credited  But like we look  Wow  You know  I think that a lot of times  What's  People take what  The constitution  Is interpreted  So I guess  That's people  Picking and choosing  Yeah  The lines  I mean I guess  Both sides do it  When there's a line 
[02:36:30]  In there  That you know  Says  Shall not be infringed  The right of the people  You know  Shall not be infringed  That's  That's  A pretty  Definite statement  You know  How come we look at  When we look at  Slavery back then  And we look at  Well that was then  How come we are able  To separate that  Well you know  They said  Freedom of speech  But blacks didn't have it  Or women didn't have it  So how come we can  Look at that  And go  Ah well that's what  The time was 
[02:37:00]  But when it comes to  Something like this  We don't look at it  And go  Well yeah  But that's what the time was  Like we're selective  In what we write them off on  Like we write them off  Like because their opinions  On human beings  Didn't include blacks  Or women  So we look at them  Like well fuck that  That's ridiculous  But with other stuff  We're like  Oh no no no  Literally  What they said  We mean it literally  Well I think  When you're correcting  The forefathers  In the fact that  They're withholding  Rights from people  I think that's a lot easier 
[02:37:30]  Than trying to  Correct them  In giving rights  To people  When they're giving  Rights to people  In their original  Bill of rights  You kind of  Agree with it  When they're  They've held back rights  Like the right  For a woman to vote  Or the right  For blacks to be free  People are more willing  To go  Alright they fucked that up  It's more  It's always been  More of a  Let's amend the 
[02:38:00]  Constitution  To give  Rights to people  Than it is to  Let's take away  The right  Look at  Prohibition  Didn't work very well  They tried taking away  People's ability  To drink  It didn't work  But there are  Limits on it  Like you're  You can't  You shouldn't  Take it away  It shouldn't be  Taken away  Right  But that  That's where  The tricky thing  Is what limits  And some people  Would say  Yeah  Take them away  Completely  Yeah  This country  Should be like  England  And civilians 
[02:38:30]  Should not be  Allowed to have  Guns  That's out there  That's really  Out there  And people are  Working very hard  To get that  Then there are  Limits  But again  What limits  It's states'  Rights right now  You know  States have the  Ability to  Govern themselves  As far as  This is concerned  I don't know why  It's kind of  An odd thing  That there isn't  Some kind of  A federal  Firearms  I would kind of  Like to have that  But then other states  You know 
[02:39:00]  Like Arizona  That doesn't have  Really any gun controls  Don't like the idea  Because they kind of  Like the way  They handle their  Own shit now  I would take  Any fucking test  Or background check  Or anything  For the ability  To  Buy  Whatever weapons  I see fit  Within reason  You know  I'm not going to  Fucking get a  Tank or anything  Right  But  You know  That's me  Other people say  That's infringing  But  So complicated  It really is a weird 
[02:39:30]  Thing that's going on  And emotion  And what really  Gets in the way  Of  Being able to  Really think this out  And  What isn't brought up  A lot  You know  The fact that  It's pretty much  50-50  Down the middle  People that want  You know  Gun control  To be  As it is  And the other 50  Don't want guns at all  You know what I mean  When you have it  Split like that  It makes it a lot tougher  To change anything  Yeah  It's like an abortion issue  Or other things like that  You know  It's just going to 
[02:40:00]  Be there  Kind of going one way  And then the other way  In the middle somewhere  It's a little tug of war  Where you see that  Dumb fucking flag  Hanging there  Moving to the left  A little bit  Moving to the right  But nothing ever gets  Every few years  Someone gets another  Little piece  One way or the other  And it kind of  Stays the same  I think after  Episodes like  What happened in  Colorado  You know  These things come up  And people want to  Push back  But the truth of the matter  Is these things  Will always fucking happen  And there's no  Putting the lid  Back on the box  And that sounds 
[02:40:30]  Like a cop out  But it's true  You can't push  Technology back  I mean  You can't  You can't say  Wow you know  People wouldn't die  In plane crashes  If we  Uninvented the plane  You know you can't  Uninvent guns  You can't  Uninvent  Powerful guns  Guns that shoot  A lot of bullets  You could try to  Regulate them  Good luck  But you know  Because for the most part  You're going to get  Bad guys that are going to  Still get position  Of these things  53 person flash mob 
[02:41:00]  Oh I saw that  Yeah  Is there ever  I'm not saying  They don't exist  Are there ever  White flash mobs  Yeah they go into malls  And they start dancing  To YMCA  Yeah  At exactly  12.05pm  And then they leave  Maybe they exist  Dude I just have  No  I've never seen one  On surveillance  Have there been any  On surveillance  That are doing  Criminal stuff  They stole a fuckload  Of jeans  From a store  And again 
[02:41:30]  They just are walking in  And not even being like  They're not being  Intimidating  Other than the fact  That there's a lot of them  They just grab  They walk around  Like they're shopping  Pick shit up  And with this  Now  Just this entitlement  And this  No fear of repercussions  Whatsoever  Walk right out of the  Fucking store with it  And the thing is  If you saw  20 young black people  Walking into your store  Yeah  And got uncomfortable  That's profiling 
[02:42:00]  Right  You're a race  There's no  Fucking winning  You can't win  You can't win  So you basically  You just have to  Deal with it  You gotta just  Deal with it  That's what society's  Telling these people  You just gotta deal with it  Yep  Unbelievable  Yes  Hey a couple other things  Before we get out of here  Jerry Jones said  Some fun things  Yesterday  I think it was yesterday  What was the  Hopefully  Did he say  That he's about  To hang himself  What  You don't think  They're gonna have  A good team this year  I don't know  I wouldn't know  I literally have no idea  What's playing for them  You could tell me 
[02:42:30]  The camp has begun  Wow  Fuck  Summer's over  You could tell me  That fucking  Put it in the book  Summer's over  Tony Dorsett  Was playing for them  Tony Dorsett  Well listen to this  I think that's  Part of leadership  Is to have some  Of the guys  That have gone before  That have been  Disappointed  To share it  With everybody involved  For me  It's a reminder  I too  Been here 23 years  And it is a reminder  I've been here  When it was  Glory hole days  And I've been here  When it wasn't 
[02:43:00]  And so having said that  I want me some glory hole  So I have that perspective  Well do you  I don't think he knows  What glory hole means  Does he  Glory hole days  Is what  Ah the glory hole days  And then the  The PR guy  For the Cowboys  Trying to help Jerry out  Oh  We'll take one more question  From Todd Archer  And before we do that  I want to remind everybody  That glory hole  Is a commonly used expression  In the oil and gas 
[02:43:30]  Exploration business  Oh  Jerry laughed  When he heard that  Yeah  Alright  They're trying to help out Jerry  So it's like  When you get a good gusher  Right  I guess  The same thing  Same thing  A good gusher  That's what a glory hole  It's a hole in a wall  With a glorious penis  Pops through  And you're like  Oh goody  I guess there was  An original  You know  Definition for glory hole  But it's not the one  We all know now  That's exploration business  So we all 
[02:44:00]  So we all  And that's news to me  Jesus that's funny  You always told me  That's funny  Go ahead  Jerry Jones said that  Yeah  News to me  News to me  He's talking about  Dick through a fucking  Hole in the wall  That's very good for him  I would have jumped in  And go  Yeah what are you  Sucking peckers  Why  It would have gone  Very well  I don't think  That would have  So stupid  Fucking place  That would have  Cracked up  No probably  No they wouldn't  I'd be like  What do you wear  A cowboy helmet

[02:49:30]  How is it a vacuum  I don't get it  There's just nothing there  There's nothing there  But then why can't you  Put your head out  In the middle of nothing  For a couple seconds  Yeah  Well because there's something  Contrary to popular belief  There's something in your head  And nothing will always  Try to take something  And how do they  How do they walk around  The moon then  I don't know  Barefoot  In those funny suits  Yeah  How heavy were the suits  Keeps them fucking  Moving  I don't know  It must have been  Pretty fucking heavy though  Yeah  But there's some gravity 
[02:50:00]  It's only one sixth gravity  Wow  Wow  Wow  But anyway  Our tire tracks  Our footprints  And how many flags  Were up there  We found a used condom  Huh  Six out of seven  Six out of seven  Are still standing  Where's the seven  It got knocked down  Oh okay  Got knocked down  Because we took off  And blew some shit around  That really would suck  To be on the moon  There's no seasonal change  Fifteen  Sixteen  Seventeen  What  There's only six 
[02:50:30]  Up there  Now they might have  Put two at once  Why are you counting  Seventeen  He's counting  The Apollo missions  Because thirteen  Didn't make it  Yeah but they dropped  The flag out  They didn't  To get down  To the landing wave  Maybe the articles  Were wrong then  Maybe a big heavy  Anchor on and they  Just dropped it  Yeah  Yeah the first one  From Apollo 11  Fell over when they  Took off  Right  Maybe another country  Left one as a goof  I think Russia sent  A probe there  And had a flag 
[02:51:00]  On the probe  But that's cheating  What it rolled  Around our moon  Yeah  Fuck that  You gotta fucking  Plant it yourself  You fucking rooshki  And do they  Go over our tire tracks  With their  Tire tracks  Nah  They should have  Just dropped the flag  With a cement base  Like a Zim Zam set  Told you  I was like  Dropped Zim Zam  On my mother's hand  And she  I was like  I'm sorry mom  And she went  You  Fuck  I just called you  A fuck  Did you feel bad  Yeah 
[02:51:30]  Dude how weird  Would it be  If you're on the moon  And there's a  You're in a rover  And then you  Kind of come across  A corner or whatever  And there's all  The shit that was left  Forty three years ago  It hasn't moved  How weird would that be  Yeah  Would that blow  Your mind you think  That would be  Fucking weird  Be cool though  Imagine if you  Came around the thing  And there was just  A hat store  That was closed  Jimmy and his hat  He's like  What is this  I love it  It's a hat store  It's not open for business  I just think 
[02:52:00]  It would be so weird  To be standing there  And look at the earth  That small  Yeah  And be like  Oh man  I got a long way  To go to get home  Would that creep you out  Yes  That would be  The creepiest  Fucking thing  Imagine if you  Were around Pluto  And you saw  Pluto  Pluto  Pluto  And you look back  From Pluto  And you saw the earth  Or the sun  As like a little dot  Fuck that  Yeah that  Because that's  What it would be like  Just a dot  Oh man  That's fucking creepy 
[02:52:30]  Yeah  And then realize  You're not even  Scratching the surface  Of how big  Everything is out there  Oh  So massive  If I could go  Anywhere in the solar system  I would want to go to  Like one of the moons  Of Saturn  Why  To be able to see  Saturn up close  Like that  Coming over the horizon  And shit  Just like  Fuck  With the rings  That'd be cool  Unless you're in the rings  You might not see them  Yeah you would  What are the rings again  Like little fucking  Rocks and dust  And particles  Ice and rock  Yeah  From a crashed  Moon 
[02:53:00]  That got broken up  And just surrounded it  It's pretty cool shit  Is what it is yo  It's not that old either  Because they said  It would be really dirty  If it was old  Maybe it's old  But not as old  As they thought  Relatively speaking  It's cleaner than they thought  Relatively  They estimate six weeks  I think they're off  Six weeks  I want to go to a planetarium  Let's go to a planetarium  Oh I love planetariums  I went to one one time  They got the Hayden Planetarium  In um  Yeah but I want to go to the Lycom  Hayden 
[02:53:30]  And then the Vanderbilt  Out on Long Island  You think the Vanderbilt  Is updated their shit  Uh probably  I would hope so  I annoyed everybody  At the planetarium  Because every time  We walked by something  I kept going  Is this actual size  I used to love  The field trips  To the planetarium  Oh yeah  The Vanderbilt planetarium  That was fun  Got to sit in those seats  Where you look 
[02:54:00]  Straight up  Science  Nice  She blinded me  We would pull pranks  In the planetarium  You'd pull pranks  Yeah  What kind of pranks  Like uh  One year we stole Jupiter  What  How'd you do that  It's just possible  We snuck it out  We rolled it down the street  I don't think you did that  Just rolling it down the street  Like a big  Bowling box  With some egghead  Running after you  Going hey we need that  It's just rolling  It is rolling down the street  Like a big medicine ball  Yeah 
[02:54:30]  Yeah  Mayor Bloomberg  Pushing New York City hospitals  To hide baby formulas  So more new moms  Will breastfeed  Oh that's nice  Did she breastfeed?  Well the problem here  Is that uh  A lot of moms have uh  Problems breastfeeding  Mayor Bloomberg  Don't you know that?  Come on  It's not as easy as you think  Yeah  They need a little  And this is very stressful  And uh  Traumatic uh  To some uh  New moms  Jeez  He's a dope  Mayor Bloomberg  Is pushing hospitals  To actually hide  To really 
[02:55:00]  To hide their baby formula  Behind locked doors  So more new mothers  Will breastfeed  Mind your fucking business  Bloomberg  Why doesn't he?  That's a very  Very personal issue  With women  What a fucking  Nudge  You don't want to fuck  With the women  And their  And their boobies  And their breastfeeding  That is  They're like Nazis man  They got groups  And all sorts of shit  This guy loves  Getting in everyone's shit  Let them do what they want  With their tits  If I was a husband  I'd be like  No breastfeeding for you  Squirt me with some milk  On my balls  Have some laughs 
[02:55:30]  Starting September 3rd  The city will keep tabs  On the number of bottles  That participating hospitals  Stock and use  The most restrictive  Pro breast milk program  In the nation  Under the city department's  Voluntary  Latch on NYC initiative  27 of the city's  40 hospitals  Have also agreed  To give up  Swag bags  Sporting formula  Company logos  Toss out formula  Branded  Chotchkes  Wow that's how you  Spell chotchkes  Yeah  Holy fuck  How do you spell 
[02:56:00]  Joneski  And fun  Joneski  And chotchkes  And mugs  Hey chotchkes  Sorry  And document  A medical reason  To every bottle  That a newborn receives  I guess you get  These formula companies  They're getting good  With the hospitals  Yeah  They're getting really  Good with the hospitals  So it makes it easy  I guess  For the new moms  To just say  Fuck it  And go with the formula  Who gives him  His information  Maybe it's cheaper though  Maybe he's tired  Of paying for formula 
[02:56:30]  When he's like  You see those fucking  Those monstrosities  Under your neck  That's where free food  Comes from you whores  Why should we pay for it  Hey you see those fucking  Those fucking cow things  You have hanging off you  That's where the food is  This is millions of dollars  We could be building roads with  Stick that thing in a kid's mouth  For nothing  Basically they're not going to  Deny the new moms out there  But it's not going to be  Like out and about  So you give birth  And then you're going to go  Hey man  You got any formula around here 
[02:57:00]  My kid's hungry  And then they'll go and get it  It'll be in storerooms  And locked boxes  That's kind of crazy  Shit like that  He should just fucking  Shut his yap  Yay  Oh well look at this  With each bottle  A mother requests  So now you're requesting  As a newborn  A new mother  She'll also get a talking to  Staffers will explain  Why she should offer  The breast instead  What is he doing  I know what they're going to say  Too  He's actually  They're going to come up  To the mother  When she's pouring formula  And say  Listen pig
