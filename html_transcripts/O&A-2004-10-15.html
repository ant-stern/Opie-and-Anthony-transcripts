<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts celebrating their return to XM Satellite Radio, joking about the spread of their "ONA virus" among listeners.  Initial technical difficulties were quickly resolved by sound engineer Jaime.  The show then featured several phone calls.  Kevin called to apologize for a past incident, while Joe from Sacramento detailed a high-stakes (40 dollar) poker game.  The hosts discussed the popularity of Texas Hold'em, particularly among high schoolers. Opie recounted a disappointing trip to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, contrasting it with the positive experience at the Hard Rock Cafe.  They also discussed other museums, including the Air and Space Museum (positive), the Museum of Natural History, and the disturbing Mütter Museum in Philadelphia.  Trucker Max called in, discussing an "O&A trucker convoy," using trucker slang ("lot lizards," "sleeper leapers"), and sharing a funny story about accidentally knocking a woman unconscious with his truck door.  The conversation delved into the darker aspects of trucker life and potential crimes.  James from Tennessee described a woman defecating in a gas station restroom and suggested sending her to New York to defecate on Jimmy Norton. David from Denver inquired about their two-year hiatus, prompting a discussion of their post-hiatus travels and activities.  The hosts then complained about the lack of XM Satellite Radio promotion, contrasting their expectations (including a proposed prison release-themed commercial) with the reality of limited promotion.  Johnny from Michigan criticized their discussion of violence and crime in the trucking industry, leading to a defensive response from the hosts, who insisted their jokes weren't serious.  The show concluded with a recounting of a recent party, including details about the attendees, a near-sweatshirt-fire incident, and witnessing a city bus dragging a car. Rich Voss was present in the studio throughout portions of this segment.


The next segment opened with a discussion of a marijuana odor masking device.  Robin from Florida called to describe a disastrous party, contrasting it with the fun of poker-and-drinking house parties.  The hosts complained about exhaustion from their early wake-up schedule, citing sore throats and illness.  They discussed a *Sink* magazine party they attended, primarily for the promised (but un-received) gift bags, and their negative experience in the VIP section. Jim Norton mentioned feeling unwell, blaming dirty casino chips and possibly “eating a little ass.” A caller jokingly linked Jim's sore throat to his activities.  The conversation shifted to Jim Norton's upcoming Donald Trump roast appearance with Regis Philbin and Rich Voss.  A caller criticized the hosts' sleep deprivation complaints, comparing them unfavorably to truck drivers.  They discussed former colleague Rocco and his car sales job, and performed a song, "Drown Cuban Drown." A collection agency called to collect a $43 debt from Jim Norton for a doctor's visit, which led to Jim recounting a humorous anecdote about the doctor and his refusal to pay. A Maverick Business Consulting advertisement aired.  The show then incorporated sound effects and discussed the show's evolution, mentioning past bits and the need to revive them, as well as the possibility of other radio DJs using their material.  The hosts discussed a physical altercation between Jay Moore and Gary Goleman from *Last Comic Standing*; Jim Norton's past fights, including an underwater brawl with a French couple; their drinking and other activities in Turks and Caicos, including a captain receiving oral sex on a boat; and an incident involving Jim Norton's wife's tandem skydiving experience. Rich Voss, a guest, shared a story about his girlfriend and an encounter with a former acquaintance on *Taxicab Confessions*.


This excerpt began with Mike from Staten Island recounting a bar fight in France sparked by a comment about corn.  This led to a discussion about negative perceptions of the French, the end of the Cold War, and anti-Semitism in France.  The conversation shifted to a friend's experiences at Club Med, focusing on alcohol and sexual encounters.  The hosts discussed the surprising popularity of their early XM broadcasts and eBay merchandise sales.  Frenchie from Brooklyn called, resulting in a heated, expletive-laden exchange with Opie and Anthony, filled with personal insults and mockery. Rich Voss, present in the studio, was also insulted.  Further conversation included discussions about Voss's dirty laundry, an anonymous caller's bizarre job application for a Wall Street barber position, an advertisement for Liquid Metal by Phone, and XM radio promotions.  Mudflap, a trucker, called, expressing amusement at the Frenchie segment. Another caller mentioned Vince McMahon's use of a "retarded" wrestler, leading to additional jokes.  There was also an update on the Sacramento poker game.  The segment concluded with a detailed description of a foul-smelling substance behind Rich Voss's ear, resulting in multiple people in the studio attempting to smell it and vomiting.  Further discussion followed regarding the show's return, Voss's loyalty, and anecdotes about being recognized by fans. The broadcast ended with jokes, promotions, and mentions of upcoming segments about Bill O'Reilly and a promised sexual encounter between a Boston couple.  The entire segment was punctuated by frequent offensive language and crude humor.


This excerpt focused on their return to radio, a "Who's Your Daddy" car sale advertisement, the renaming of their XM radio channel ("High Voltage"), and listener calls interspersed with discussions about New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevy's alleged sexuality and the upcoming presidential election.  A caller insulted Jim Norton, leading to a heated exchange.  The hosts discussed Bill O'Reilly, including an interview clip where he criticized shock jocks while facing sexual misconduct allegations.  Natalia, a caller, gave a positive review of a sexual encounter with Jim Norton, which was discussed in detail.  Other topics included a discussion about a potential new driver for their moving company and promotional announcements for XM radio programming.  The tone was highly informal, sexually explicit, and filled with profanity and vulgar humor.


The final excerpt centered on Bill O'Reilly and his reaction to the show.  The segment heavily featured sexually explicit language and references to O'Reilly's alleged sexual misconduct.  The hosts recounted O'Reilly's on-air criticism, focusing on the show's sexually charged content and their previous firing for an April Fool's Day prank and simulated sexual encounter broadcast from St. Patrick's Cathedral.  They repeatedly claimed ignorance regarding the specifics of O'Reilly's alleged actions while expressing belief in the accusations.  They discussed the show's shock value and boundary-pushing nature, speculating about O'Reilly's motivations and hypocrisy.  Numerous listener calls contributed to the discussion, sharing opinions on O'Reilly and the show's content.  The hosts engaged in sexually suggestive jokes and banter, including discussions about vibrators, dildos, and sexual acts. Technical issues with audio quality and phone lines were also mentioned.

[00:04:30]  Stop laughing at me.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the ONA virus.  We're now on XM Satellite Radio and we couldn't be happier.  I want to say hi to everybody that turned on their radios overnight.  Got to start the show every day with that because this is a very, very interesting thing.  This ONA virus slowly but surely spreading every single day, man.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I got to go right to the phones because Kevin wants to say hi.  He's in New York.  What's up, Kevin?  Kevin! 
[00:05:00]  Hello?  Hey, Kevin.  Hey.  Oh, boy.  Uh.  Oh, boy.  Uh, the phone.  Did we go through the checklist there?  Hey, Kevin.  We didn't go through all the All Systems Go checklist.  They were in here doing the All Systems Go checklist.  Kevin.  All right, we'll put Kevin back on hold.  You just hold on.  He had something cool to say and then there's a guy in Sacramento.  It's 3 a.m. there and he's drunk playing poker.  I want to see what he's all about.  Now we can do it?  Jaime!  Jaime rocks.  Kevin, what's up?  What's up?  Hello?  Look at that.  Two seconds and Jaime has it fixed. 
[00:05:30]  You are the man.  You know you're moving your family up to New York, right?  You just don't know it yet.  We need him here all the time.  We're going to negotiate.  Hey, Kevin.  What's up, buddy?  Yeah, I'm just going to wish you guys congratulations and also see if I can make amends.  Amends?  What happened?  Oh, about four years ago.  Oh, I don't want to talk to you.  That's Spaz.  Oh, Jesus.  Spaz, you're dead.  Figure it out. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, my God.  He tricked us pretty good, though.  Joe from Sacramento, what's up?  What's up, man?  How is everybody?  Oh, baby, whoo!  Oh, baby, whoo!  Jesus.  It's three in the morning.  What's up, man?  What's up, baby, whoo!  All right.  What's up, guys?  Oh, this is bringing back such great memories for me.  I remember being like these guys.  Yeah, we're going to get into what we're like these days in a moment, but that's why I wanted to go to this call.  Hey, what's going on in Sacramento right now, Joe? 
[00:06:30]  Right now in Sacramento, it is 3-0-7.  We're playing poker, and I'm whooping my boy's ass.  This is a poker right now, man.  We're listening to ONA Live, baby.  Nice.  You're doing the Texas Hold'em?  Hell yeah.  Nice.  It's the only game to play these days.  Only game anyone plays now.  Texas Hold'em.  And now the media is getting all paranoid because they're doing all these articles.  Are our high school kids hooked on Texas Hold'em?  It's true.  Like, a lot of people in high school are playing poker now.  In the schoolyard and at lunchtime. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  We're not in high school, man.  No, I understand that.  I can figure that much out.  So how much are you up?  What's up?  How much are you up?  I'm up like 40 bucks right now, man.  40 bucks?  Oh, wow.  High stakes game.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a whopper, man.  If you're up 40 bucks, I say you're about 22 years old.  Dude, you're right on, man.  There you go.  Look at O.  22 years old.  I remember playing poker as a high school kid, and if I went home with 20 in my pocket,  I was like, oh, man.  What?  I'm rich.  Great. 
[00:07:30]  You know what you ought to do, though, just to have fun?  Play with Monopoly money.  Yeah, because it's the game.  That's the fun part.  Right.  The camaraderie with the boys.  Yeah, you play for fun.  Yeah.  And then you divvy up the money when you're done, and you give it back.  That's right.  You all take turns with the girl who's on the poker table, passed out.  Throw down the stairs, and you'll laugh about it.  All right.  You guys, you don't know how psyched we are to listen to you live right now, man.  You don't know how psyched we are to be here live.  Two years for you guys, dude.  I know.  This is what's so weird about this whole XM satellite thing. 
[00:08:00]  Every day, people are discovering that we're back.  It's like, hello, do you read a fucking newspaper?  Really?  It's taken a long time to get the word out that we're back.  But spread the word in Sacramento for us.  All right, Joe?  I've been listening to you on the Internet for the last two years, man.  Yeah, speaking of the Internet, will you get the eBay list?  People are getting out of control with selling O&A merchandise.  Yeah.  And we don't give a crap, but some of the stuff they're trying to sell is just absolutely hilarious.  Is this the latest one?  Yeah.  Like this morning?  No, get this morning, because I saw a few new ones up there. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, really?  People posting new ones now?  Oh, yeah.  It's not like we're Marilyn Monroe, you know?  Some kind of items that you can't possibly get anywhere else.  They're selling stuff you can get anywhere.  Well, you know what?  We went to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland.  Oh, how was that?  I didn't go to it.  I missed that trip.  Oh, you didn't go either.  I heard it stunk.  I would never go.  It's pretty much families going through dead rock stars' closets and going through their 
[00:09:00]  attics.  I'd rather just go to the Hard Rock and get a Ronnie James Dio burger and sit down and  look at the trash on the walls.  You know, the Hard Rock Cafe here in New York City has better stuff than the Rock and Roll  Hall of Fame in Cleveland.  They got so much garbage up there.  I heard it sucked.  Everyone that went that day with you, Steve C. and Big Kev said it stunk.  It was boring as hell.  The building is absolutely beautiful.  It's unbelievable, right on the water and stuff and state-of-the-art, but the stuff 
[00:09:30]  in there is like, who cares?  I didn't even find the Doors exhibit, one of my all-time favorite bands of all time.  Did you have a little map that they give you when you go in?  Oh, if we make a right, we can get to the Aerosmith display.  No.  We turn left and John Lennon's pants are around the corner.  Let's take a look at that.  Oh, I want a picture of that.  It was a huge disappointment.  And then they have Alan Freed, one of the first DJs, his ashes just on display there. 
[00:10:00]  Wait, wait.  His ashes?  Of course he's dead, but they cremated him and left his ashes there?  You're walking down a hall towards, I don't know, the cafeteria area, and all of a sudden  there's just a glass window, and there's his ashes just sitting there.  I'm sure that's what he wants.  Yeah, I'm sure he wants it to be on display.  Doesn't his family have any say in that?  I'm sure they probably made some good money to give the ashes up.  I don't know.  I probably thought it would be a great honor to be featured in that awful building.  I can't see going to these Hall of Fame things.  Like even Cooperstown, the Baseball Hall of Fame. 
[00:10:30]  That was pretty cool.  What's cool about it?  I've never been.  Perhaps I'm wrong.  But to me, it just seems like something that would be really boring.  I haven't been there in a very long time, but it's very cool seeing all the old baseballs  and autographs and stuff Babe Ruth wore.  That's kind of cool.  Really?  I think so, yeah.  Do they have Joe DiMaggio's penis with Marilyn's lipstick around it?  Nothing like that?  They do have a picture of her face with his World Series ring imprint on it. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, there it is.  The coolest museum I've ever been to is the one I went with you, Anthony.  Oh, the Air and Space Museum in Washington.  No.  That one's cool.  I like that.  High tech.  That was definitely cool.  Museum of Natural History?  Cool.  In New York City?  Dinosaur bones and stuff?  And the caveman down there?  We were down there.  Remember, they were getting the Indian Museum together and they didn't give it much land  and we were laughing our asses off.  I'm like, oh, look.  Yeah.  Look, they can't even do the Indians right in the year 2004. 
[00:11:30]  Short change in the engine.  They're putting this huge museum together and it's on this tiny plot of land.  What are they going to have in there?  Slot machines and blackjack tables?  Is there a little engine exhibit?  And here's a stick you made and called a tool and here's something you killed in war.  End of display.  Here's a rock you used to paint your face with.  Ooh.  Fascinating.  And here's those awful cave paintings with the old cancer-legged horses you put up, idiots.  No, I'm talking about the Muter.  Oh, that thing. 
[00:12:00]  No, see that.  The Muter Museum in Philly.  That was disgusting.  That was the coolest museum I've ever been to in my life.  And it's a tiny little place in downtown Philly and most people don't even know it's there.  It's a tumor museum and a human freak show museum.  It's like a medical museum, sure.  Yeah, a medical museum.  So they go back to like the 1800s and they have bodies in there and bones of like elephant  man type bones.  And what about the woman that was buried and they dug her up years later and because of  all the lie in the ground that she was buried in, she turned into soap. 
[00:12:30]  They call her Soap Lady.  Soap Lady.  And they just have her under this glass display, this dead body that is turned into soap.  I'm trying to remember all the other stuff they had, but it was a great day.  I think all women should be like that, so after you fuck them, you don't have to shower.  Auto clean.  Nice.  Hey, we got Max on the line.  He's trying to say that he's got an O&A trucker convoy going.  I want to know what an O&A trucker convoy is. 
[00:13:00]  But I think they're still talking.  Oh, there he is.  Okay, let's go to Max and see what this is all about.  Hey, Max.  What's going on, man?  What's going on, guys?  Let me get my trucker lingo out so I can talk to our brand new trucker listeners.  We're not used to this.  We've been doing radio for 10 years.  We've never had a trucker audience.  Got a couple new words for your trucker dictionary, if you want.  All right.  Let's hear a few more.  Truck stop prostitutes or lot lizards.  Lot lizards.  We heard lot lizards.  I know that one. 
[00:13:30]  And they got a lot of these chicks that hate, like, I don't know what you call them, truck driver groupies.  You know, they'll go with the driver for a while, and then they'll hook up with another guy and go with him for a while and call them sleeper leapers.  Sleeper leapers.  We heard that.  But what's in it for the girl, though?  I mean, is it a brick over the head and a shallow grave on the side of the interstate?  Right.  Usually it's these scungy, nasty-looking bitches that, you know, pretty much anybody with any respectability wouldn't want to have nothing to do with. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  You're broke, need a fix, or God knows what.  It's never like the movies where they're a young teen runaway that you grab up.  It's some toothless 50-year-old woman.  So you got the sleeper leaper, and eventually you're going to have to call the meat wagon, right?  Right.  Pretty much.  So I was also going to tell you the night before.  That would be an ambulance, Anthony.  Of course.  Okay.  Huh?  I was over here at Tucson, and I turned my door open. 
[00:14:30]  I just dropped my shirt at this damn lot.  It was locked up, and I hit it in the forehead with the door and knocked her out.  You knocked her out.  Knocked her unconscious, man.  It scared the shit out of me.  I was like, you know, if you ever park too close to something, you know, you're not paying attention.  You throw your door out, open it, it just stops.  You know, what the fuck?  So you had a killer, right?  I understand.  And there's this bitch.  So that's how you made it look like an accident.  Yes.  It kind of looks like a cross between Roseanne Barr and Madeline Albright. 
[00:15:00]  I was like, holy shit.  Wow.  I walked into the truck stop, and I said, hey, you better call the ambulance or something.  And there's a knockout wild wizard that's not up in the, you know, out in the...  Hey, I'm going to try my truck lingo on the trucker.  All right, Opie, give it a try.  So did you knock out the sleeper leaper because you're a strawberry cowboy?  No.  And you had a little anger?  No.  Gee, what's a strawberry cowboy? 
[00:15:30]  Gee, I can't figure that one out.  No, it was a bona fide accident, man.  I got the hell out of here quick.  I didn't say I'd go to jail.  I got to think you truckers are loving listening to Opie and Anthony because we're so naive as  far as this whole trucker community thing goes.  We have not a clue on the East Coast, man.  My, uh, I got an 18-year-old son, and, uh, we live in Dallas, and he's over in Iraq right  now, but he turned me on to you guys back when you were on KLRF in Dallas. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you guys were on after Russ Martin down there.  Uh-huh.  And I was pissed.  I was like, the day before you guys got booted off the air, I heard you one day, and I loved  it, so I turned the radio on the next day, and there was some goober that was local down  there.  I was like, what the fuck is this shit?  Yeah, we figured we'd do one show, uh, entertain you, and then end on a high note.  It worked, though.  I was like, man, so I am so damn glad you guys are back.  All right, so what is an ONA trucker convoy? 
[00:16:30]  You got a bunch of you guys listening right now?  What I was wanting to do was not, when I get back to Dallas, I got to give me a new computer.  I wound up checking it at my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago and busted it.  Ah, I love Texas.  Just throw a computer at her stupid face.  All right.  Get my computer up and started, you know, opening the Anthony Trucker website.  Oh, right.  That's cool.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  Oh, that's cool.  When you get it up and running, just give us an email.  I'm going to let you go for now, all right, Max? 
[00:17:00]  All right.  You guys have a good one, man.  You're in Arizona.  Watch out for those alligators.  Alligators?  That's what they call blown tires on the side of the road, too.  Oh, an alligator, right.  The tread.  Very, very creative, you truckers.  I like that.  Yeah, I like that.  You guys have a good one, man.  You're right.  All right.  Watch out for the pickle parks.  All right.  I'm learning this stuff, Anthony.  Those truckers, Opie.  A little frightening sometimes.  A little frightening.  They have to be laughing at us, because we don't have a clue. 
[00:17:30]  No, no.  I like watching those shows on A&E.  You ever see those crime shows where they solve the crime?  They show you how the crime was solved.  It's real life and stuff.  So many truckers involved with those murders, man.  So many.  You always find the evidence in those sleepers.  God knows what's going on in those sleeper cabs.  I'm not saying all of you guys are sick, twisted bastards, but, you know, I think it's  just part of being out there on the road.  You're all to yourself. 
[00:18:00]  You've got really no ties anywhere, and you just pick up these broads, and I think if  you feel so inclined to smash them over the head, I think you do.  It just seems to be easier to dispose of them.  Right.  You don't really have a place.  You know, you're kind of out there all over.  The crime scene is the United States of America.  A lot of lonely road.  Yeah.  I mean, look at us in New York City.  We can't dispose of a body here.  Very difficult.  Unless you're the mob.  Yeah, then you put them in a 55-gallon drum, and you dump them off in that lot in Queens.  But if you're driving around, and your home is your truck, you just pick up that teenage 
[00:18:30]  hooker, and you drive with her a while, and you wrap her over the head, and off she goes  onto the side of the road, and then you're gone.  It tells me that happens a lot.  We really...  All right.  All right.  What's the problem?  Nothing.  Problem.  Problem.  Less complaining today.  James from Tennessee.  What's up, James?  How's it going, guys?  Pretty good.  Hey, I just...  I work for a courier company. 
[00:19:00]  I just...  Yesterday...  Yesterday...  I do a lot of traveling myself.  I bet.  Yesterday, I'm in Georgia, okay?  Uh-huh.  And I'm listening to you guys, and I'm thinking about Jimmy, because whenever I'm going into  this Chevron station...  I love it.  Good-looking chick.  Good-looking chick.  She's walking out of the bathroom.  She leaves like an eight-inch log in the damn toilet.  Really?  Yeah.  She's a good-looking chick, and I'm thinking, hell, this is Jimmy's thing. 
[00:19:30]  So I talked to this girl.  She's going to New York Wednesday.  What did you say to her, ma'am?  I noticed your log, and I have a friend.  You guys should have coffee?  No, I said, I said, I know this guy.  I said, have you ever heard of old P.A.  He said, no.  No, I never have heard of that.  I said, well, I see.  Sounds like a girl that should listen to our show, leaving logs in the toilet.  And you know what?  You're very thoughtful, sir.  So you want this girl to come to New York and take a little dump on our friend, little  Jimmy Norton, huh? 
[00:20:00]  Well, sir, I hope it was hers.  I thought it'd be a pretty good bid if she come up there and did take a dump on Jimmy.  I mean, he's into that shit.  Well, you know, sir, I hope it was her.  What if she just walked in to fix her makeup, and then she comes out, and that log belonged  to a trucker, so I fly her up here, and I lay back with a smile on my face, and she  hits a soupy evacuation all over my chest and neck.  Did you ever think of that, fellow?  Do you understand the hazards of that game?  I mean, she sounds like a great girl. 
[00:20:30]  Along with the suppository you talked about last week, huh?  I think it's funny that you approached her.  Not only that you noticed, but you had to tap her on the shoulder and have it off her.  Well, I noticed you left something in the bowl.  That's some log you left there, darling.  I like this guy.  Right on, James.  Anyway, she's going to give you guys a call anyway today.  She wants to play What's in My Pants.  All right, cool.  I hope so.  I'd like her to play What's in the Bowl.  James, you just... 
[00:21:00]  Her name's Daphne.  She's from Blue Ridge, Georgia.  All right.  She's about 5'1".  This is no kidding.  She weighs about 115.  She's probably got C, double C, something like that.  All right.  Well, thank you.  Well, thanks.  Thank you.  Thanks, man.  And, James, how long have you been listening to the show?  I just...  It was the very first day that you guys came on.  It's the first time I'd ever heard about it.  I heard the plugs and everything.  And you're already hooked with the virus or what? 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, absolutely.  Cool, man.  I've got...  I work for, like I said, a courier company.  I've got...  All right.  And we all travel to a bunch of places that can't pick up radio.  So we all bought XM.  I was just hoping for a yes or no, but that's okay.  All right.  Thank you, James.  All right.  All right.  Phones are doing well.  Let's go to Denver and see what David has to say.  There's a whole other part of this country, Opie.  I laugh.  A whole other part.  And they're laughing at us because I'm sure we sound funny to them, too, out there.  A whore!  David, what's up? 
[00:22:00]  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  I've been waiting two years to talk to you guys.  Oh, cool.  Well, make it good because some of these guys are slowing us down a little bit.  In Denver.  Oh, I know.  This guy, he's going to be hard to follow the quality radio that these guys are providing  for you guys.  But I've got to say hi to Norton.  Hi, sir.  How's it going, Jimmy?  I'm good, thank you.  How are you?  My throat's a bit sore, to be honest.  I was very restless in my sleep last night.  Uh-oh.  Your immune system a little down?  No, who knows?  I mean, let's hope that's all it is. 
[00:22:30]  Uh-huh.  Start to panic.  Hey, David, what do you got?  What, sweetie?  I just want to say if the ninja is acting up, you know.  The ninja.  Oh, I don't have the him.  I do have a little pimple on the side of my bag.  Uh-oh.  I know, that's from whacking and dozing off without getting that little oil out of there?  Yeah.  Nothing to be alarmed there, folks.  I got a question for Anthony.  I mean, Opie's been talking about what he did, the two years that you guys were gone,  and you know, talking about going to the Grand Canyon, dying over there, and being the comedy 
[00:23:00]  groupie that he was.  Yeah.  What about Anthony?  I mean, were you just playing any Everqueer again, or any new programs?  You were working into new games?  Mine was a lot of video games, and then I just would get little hobbies.  I got into the radio control helicopters for a while.  That was a lot of fun, and I'm looking forward to getting back into that.  I did nothing.  I did nothing for two years.  Opie was traveling.  He's off.  I'm trying to call him up.  Where is he now?  Oh, he's in Canada with a comedy tour. 
[00:23:30]  He's in L.A., hanging out with Super Agent Bob Eatman.  He's at the Grand Canyon.  Hey, Opie, where are you today?  Oh, I'm on the exit, Dealey Plaza in Texas.  Oh, great.  You know, where are you today, Opie?  Oh, I'm in Orlando.  He's all over the place.  Where am I?  Oh, Brooklyn.  I'm in Brooklyn today.  Where am I?  Oh, I'm two feet from where I was yesterday when I talked to you, Opie.  Opie's already taken like five planes to places, and I'm in the same place.  I was a little restless.  I couldn't sit still.  I had to get out on the road. 
[00:24:00]  I just stepped off the planet.  I should have got myself a big rig.  You could have made a little money.  You see me in a big rig?  Forget it.  All right.  Thanks, David.  Thanks a lot.  And I want to say thanks to Finder Music, ONA Virus, Whackback, Eatabully.com, and all  those guys because they keep my own A.  We need award show music.  I know.  Thank you, mister.  We need award show music so we can play that over the callers that just keep thanking people  when we want to hang up.  All the great websites associated with the Opie and Anthony show.  You can find them on OpieandAnthony.com, okay?  Right.  All right.  Well, we want to try the calls today because we didn't go to them much yesterday. 
[00:24:30]  Well, you know, sometimes you go to the calls and they really stink, and then we have to  punish the callers by not taking calls.  Yeah, because you guys are part of the show, too.  You'll figure that out as we move on here.  You're part of the show.  So when you say, oh, man, they weren't that good today, well, what did you do to make  it good?  You remember the other day?  We had a little problem with our own Eric, right?  Right.  And what happened?  He was punished.  He sure was.  Now, the callers, they do the same thing.  You screw up, you're going to get punished.  You're going to send the callers home? 
[00:25:00]  We send the callers home, and they shan't be on the show that day.  All right.  But now today, we're kind of off to a better start.  I think a lot of the new listeners need to be brought up to speed with the program and how interactive  it is and how they're able to contribute.  And some of them know how to do this, and some of them don't, Opie.  This is what I'm noticing, and XM has to get on the ball.  We have more new listeners than old listeners listening right now, which means they're just  not promoting us properly.  All our old listeners are still out there trying to figure out where we are. 
[00:25:30]  Dude, when you're coming back, dude.  You know, all the, I mean, we didn't have truckers calling when we used to do this radio show,  and that's all that's calling right now.  I must say, we never had truckers call on our old show.  No, the satellite radio is the hottest thing with the truckers.  I think you're wrong about them not promoting, though.  I mean, I called up and talked to people at XM, and they didn't deny that you were on.  I want them to be proud that they have Opie and Anthony.  I want a billboard.  I've not really seen that yet.  I want billboards. 
[00:26:00]  I want some ads.  I've seen the TV commercials where the guy drives his car into the office building in  the elevator, and he drives up by his cubicle, snaps his XM out, and puts it in the boombox  near his desk.  Why can't we be in that commercial?  Well, when they were wooing us, remember, they said, we're going to have a national commercial.  National commercial with us.  Maybe the license plate says O&A on it, if you look real close.  Yeah, maybe that.  You know, O&A on his little wow sticker on the back of his car as he drives it into his 
[00:26:30]  office.  We were supposed to have a national opiate Anthony commercial.  What happened?  I don't know.  Well, I know what happened.  We signed those contracts.  That lawyer lady grabbed them and ran out of the room.  We didn't even celebrate.  Next thing you know, they're kicking us out the door on a train back to New York.  That's what happened.  You'd think we'd learn.  They kissed.  They wooed us like, you wouldn't believe.  And then as soon as we signed that contract, it was like, hey, what happened?  What about the TV spots?  I want to be on TV.  We actually had an idea for a commercial.  We have a great idea for a commercial. 
[00:27:00]  But now we couldn't do it because it's too late, because we're back.  This was something before we came back.  We wanted to do like the scene from Brubaker.  Right.  When they let him out of solitary.  Let him out of the hole, the box.  And it was really bright, and they couldn't see.  And that would be us.  And we would.  Yeah, they would open up this tin shack on a prison yard, have like a corrections worker  open it up.  And the sun would shine in.  We'd be trying to block the sun from our eyes.  We'd be in chewed up prison attire and kind of limp out of there. 
[00:27:30]  Emaciated.  Like we've been in solitary.  We've been in the box for two years.  And then the rest of the prisoners would slowly start.  Do the slow clap.  And then start chanting.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Start chanting O-N-A.  Right.  Slow.  As we get out.  And then it would build.  They're back.  They're back.  On XM Satellite Radio.  Oh, they loved it while they were wooing us.  Oh, we're actually calling a production guy now, remember?  Maybe.  They were calling up a company that was going to produce this whole thing.  Maybe the slowdown is they're trying to figure out which director to use. 
[00:28:00]  Maybe that's it.  Do we go with Spielberg?  Hmm.  Who do we go with?  Who do we go with?  Hmm.  Maybe they're still looking over scripts.  Yeah, that's probably it.  They need a good director of photography because it should be a really nice shot of us coming  out of there.  It's got to be lit right.  Of course.  They're still working on it.  Yeah.  Know what marketing we've had for the show so far besides, like, whoring ourselves to  the media and make them believe we're sorry for what we did? 
[00:28:30]  I know.  Every interview.  Would we shut up already?  Yeah, we're really sorry.  Figure it out.  It made us bigger.  Read between the lines.  I don't want the media to ever figure us out, actually.  Uh, we got, I think we got, I don't know, I mean, I don't think anybody's loud.  Yeah, that's us.  That's us.  No, that was you when we were being interviewed by the New York Times yesterday.  Right, right.  And, uh, here's a clip of Opie, uh, from the post-interview.  I'm sorry.  I don't know, I mean, I don't think anybody's loud. 
[00:29:00]  Right, right.  You understand.  Just act stupid and they'll accept your apology.  Yeah.  No, I saw a little ad in the Boston paper one day in the sports section.  You did?  That said we were back.  There you go.  Stop.  That's what we got so far.  And the other thing they promised us, and remember, we love XM Satellite Radio.  Because they get pissed off down there.  Oh, don't get us wrong, but we love being here.  You did say that we were going to have a TV commercial.  And they did say we were going to have a huge 18-wheeler truck with Opie and Anthony are back.  Oh, right. 
[00:29:30]  XM Satellite Radio.  And, uh, pretty much the four months we weren't allowed to broadcast, that was going to be crisscrossing across America.  Right.  Hanging out with all the good buddies out there.  You know, on display at the Pickle Parks.  Right.  Instead, uh, they almost made good.  They put our cartoon characters on the side of a XM Satellite Radio van that now just sits in the compound and they don't really drive around.  Sits in the, uh, XM parking lot in D.C. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  Well, track the trailer, big TV campaign, or a Ford Econo line van that sits in the parking lot.  Yeah.  Driving out of the compound, everyone who lives around there just jumps on it.  Like in, like in that, in the, uh, amusement park.  All right.  Turn your windshield wipers on, quickly.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  We just pissed off a trucker?  We can't piss off...  What did we do?  We cannot piss off the truckers.  We understand this is how this show is going to grow. 
[00:30:30]  Johnny from Michigan.  What's up, Johnny?  Did anything.  Welcome back, folks.  What's up, Johnny?  Uh, you guys are like, uh, your career is like a cancer that, that keeps coming out of remission.  But anyway, you guys have pissed me off this morning.  What did we do?  What did we do?  I've been listening to you guys for two weeks, and now you got this new truck driving audience.  I've been out here four years.  We got a bad enough fucking rap, and here you guys are talking about murder and raping.  I'm just saying what I saw on those A&E shows.  You know?  Those are the things we like about you. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, that...  Investigative reports.  Death on the highway.  That's what's endearing, bro.  And you guys, you guys are just Satanists that have sex in churches.  No, I know.  We got our own problems.  Trust me.  You can't take what we say on this show seriously, Johnny, or you're never going to have fun with this show.  No, I really don't.  I've been listening to you guys for fucking years, man, and it's great to have you guys back, but you know...  Nope, dude.  Nobody means anything.  Just get in your truck, you murdering, crank-doing motherfucker, and just go and kill and  rape and stab and molest children all the way across the country. 
[00:31:30]  Hey, this is an idiot now, pal.  All right.  Jimmy, it's not time to get you fired up yet.  All right, Johnny, thank you.  Hey, you guys have a good one.  All right.  Thanks, man.  Don't take what we say on this show seriously.  It's funny.  He doesn't mind me joking about having AIDS or eating anthrax, but don't make fun of the old truckers.  Don't make fun of them.  Stop it.  We're just a bunch of idiots.  Of course.  We mean nothing.  All right.  Yes, Ant?  To the trucker out there.  I'm sorry.  I don't think anybody loud. 
[00:32:00]  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Giovanni Ribisi.  I think we just have to play that clip and all is good with the world.  All is good.  Giovanni?  I'm sorry.  I don't think anybody loud.  I would say to be tired.  Look at that.  All the truckers are smiling now.  All right.  You can tell we're a little low key today.  A little woozy today.  We're fine, though.  We're getting started.  We're warming up.  It's because we were partying last night.  Yeah!  Woo! 
[00:32:30]  Nice partying.  Why don't we step aside?  We'll talk about that next.  I stink.  Our lives used to be so much cooler.  I used to be the party guy.  I was party guy.  Now I'm pussy guy.  You were...  I was awful last night.  You were a drag.  We'll get into it next, okay?  Also on the show today, supposedly that couple's going to try to outdo Tennessee from yesterday.  The Boston couple.  That'd be nice.  The Boston couple?  O'Reilly vows to fight harassment charges.  Good luck, Bill.  You're going to need it. 
[00:33:00]  And other things on the way.  And Rich Voss.  Yeah, Voss is here.  I saw Voss in the...  Yeah, he's here.  Oh, you're already good.  Yeah, we can't call it the green room.  He's just wandering around the cuticles out there.  He's up pretty early for a comic.  He's a mess.  His eyes are all red, and you can tell he's totally out of it.  He probably hasn't slept.  He's probably been up since last night.  All right, why don't we step aside here?  Here's another bunch of genetic defectives who've been turned loose on answering machines. 
[00:33:30]  These guys who cannot resist the urge to put music on their outgoing messages.  You know, some guy spends $8 at Radio Shack, and suddenly he's a fucking record producer.  And because he's busy in the basement jacking off his dog, I, I have to listen to substandard  music.  And it's always rotten music, you know?  It's either New Age, that pointless, meandering zombie noise played by pseudo-spiritual lunatics 
[00:34:00]  who think wind chimes are a musical instrument, or else it's soft rock, soft rock, that lame-ass,  weak, non-threatening, suburban white boy junk played by bands like Men Without Testicles.  Oh, and folks, on these answering machines, do me a favor, would you please?  When you record your outgoing message, don't bother telling me you can't come to the phone.  I understand that.  Apparently, that's why we have these machines. 
[00:34:30]  And don't tell me to leave my name and number.  Somehow, I figured that out.  And if you work in an office, never mind that stuff, I'm away from my desk.  If you had to take a shit, say so.  Just say, hi, this is Mary Louise.  I had the Mexican jalapeno bean chili dip, and I washed it down with a gallon of gin.  I'll be in and out all day. 
[00:35:00]  Hey.  There are some more people who ought to be strapped into chairs and beaten with hammers.  People who wear visors.  Let me ask you something.  What the fuck is the point in wearing half a hat?  Either get a hat or don't.  No one's interested in the top of your head.  Go back to the store and tell them to give you the rest of the hat. 
[00:35:30]  They cheated you.  Better still, get yourself one of them little Jewish hats and sew it to your visor.  Then you got yourself a full-fledged fucking hat, my friend.  Here are some more musical vermin whose mothers we wish had had medical plans that included abortion.  These singers.  These singers who think they're so special, they only need one name. 
[00:36:00]  Bono, Sting, Jewel, Tiffany, Prince.  What a crock of shit.  Get a fucking last name, would you please?  I got a nice two-word name for you.  Pretentious Cocksucker.  How do you like that?  Bono, Sting.  It's not bad enough, the music sucks, but with no last name, you can't find out where they live to throw a fucking bomb through their window.  It's frustrating.  Here are some more people who deserve an inoperable tumor at the base of their spines. 
[00:36:30]  These guys who fly around the world in a fucking balloon.  You know?  What is this, 1850?  Get a fucking airline ticket, will you please?  When are the media going to realize no one's interested in some rich trouser stain who's so bored he's got to fly around the balloon all day? 
[00:37:00]  I hope the next guy gets hit by lightning.  He flies around in a little fart circle.  And lands in a sewage treatment pond.  And sinks with the rest of the turds.  Mr. Lighter Than Air.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, I fucked them.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I say, don't you know?  You say, you don't know.  I say.  Take me out.  I say, you don't show.  Don't move.  Time's low.  I say.  Take me out.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:38:00]  Thanks for checking us out today.  We're still trying to wake up a little bit.  This is the first day I'm trying to wake up in two weeks.  It finally hit me.  Why, you've actually been sleeping?  I've been trying to sleep, but my body's saying, eh-eh.  Good luck.  When you spend most of your life, you know, staying up at night and sleeping late, and  the next thing you know, you take on a new challenge and you have to be up at 3 in the  morning, 3.30 in the morning, you know, your body fights that, I guess.  I haven't had to wake up in the morning for over 10 years. 
[00:38:30]  And this is just not my style.  I am a night person, I'm a sleep late person, and this just doesn't cut it.  It's going to have to, but I'm trying to get used to it.  Yeah, we'll definitely make it happen.  But last night was a prime example of what happens when you have to change your lifestyle  and get up early in the morning and go to sleep early.  And I failed the test. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, we were invited to the Sync Magazine party because we're in the latest issue of  Sync Magazine.  I don't know, I really don't know why we're in the magazine.  And they're kind of bummed.  They're fans of the show.  Everyone gets bummed because we trash just about everything.  And we walk in and like, oh, we hear you didn't really like your feature in our magazine.  I'm really sorry, we did the best.  We're like, shut up, we're just having fun, man.  But it is a little strange.  We had a guy interview us for over an hour, and my quote is, I'm such a retard with this 
[00:39:30]  stuff.  And Anthony's quote is, we're going to have women call in and rub themselves with the  phone.  If we guess from the sound whether she has a strip or the triangle, she'll win something  big.  And then it says, don't like it, don't listen.  Yeah.  And we're playing with like...  Radio-controlled cars.  Radio-controlled race cars.  And they got a picture of us trying to figure out how to make these things work.  And that's all the article is.  There you go.  And I thought they were doing like a big, you know, a big expose on the O.B. 
[00:40:00]  and Anthony show.  Yeah, it's a quick, you know, one hitter right there on the back page.  And I got to love my family.  I take my brother to this Sink magazine party.  And I go, you know, in a way you're kind of proud you're in a magazine.  And I'm just a stupid guy from Long Island.  And I'm in a national magazine.  So I'm showing my brother like, look, dude, what do you think?  You're a big brother there.  Oh, my God.  That's awful.  Oh, geez.  Great.  That's an awful picture.  I'm like, well, all right. 
[00:40:30]  Thanks, dude.  Thanks for the support.  I think it's fine.  And the people from Sink were very cool.  It really is fine.  I call it a...  I don't know.  There's nothing to it.  It's a nothing to it page in the magazine.  There you go.  You're not going to really learn anything about us.  No.  You're not even going to really...  I don't know.  Yeah, you're just not going to get anything from it.  That's awful.  You'll see us.  And it says XM Satellite Radio.  That's all we care about.  That's it.  Opie and Anthony, XM Satellite Radio.  That'll gain a few more people to this ONA virus thing.  Opie, it's more promotion than we've gotten from XM. 
[00:41:00]  Good point.  So I have no problem with it.  No, no.  XM trumped the Sink people.  They put the ad for our show with our caricatures in Rolling Stone magazine.  The latest issue of Rolling Stone magazine.  We have a little ad.  All right.  You know, if...  Well, that's cool, too.  You got to slow down as you're reading the pages to see it.  Slow way down.  Slow down.  Actually, I think it's in the CD review section.  So they even got good placement.  So the people at Sink are really cool. 
[00:41:30]  They had a party last night.  And, you know, I love a party.  I love a good party.  Especially when you're invited as a VIP.  Because, you know, we're in the magazine.  And when you're invited as a VIP, it's free drinks.  And I love parties with free drinks.  The VIP thing is hilarious.  Because we show up and they're like, oh, you're in the VIP section.  And they got these really hot women to escort us to the VIP section.  And I'm thinking, wow, I can't wait to say hi to Donald Trump. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  Go to the VIP section.  And I was like, where's the VIP section?  And I was in it.  I had no clue.  And I'm saying to the girl, can you get me a seat next to Tyra Banks?  I want to see what she's all about in real life.  No, the closest you got was a seat next to the guy that works at a bank.  No one.  Nothing.  No one.  But I had something there.  Apparently, I was wrong.  A little early.  Because your first day thinking, you were probably thinking of another Tyra who's awful that you can mention. 
[00:42:30]  But there was no other Tyra.  You went right through my whole mindset right there.  There's no way.  There's no other Tyra.  I stink on ice.  So we go to the VIP section and hang out with the rest of the Zeros.  Yeah.  And then we discovered, I guess, we were the biggest thing there because, you know, they got the photographers coming.  Well, they had the chicks from the game, the Swedish gaming chicks.  Which are much hotter at night, by the way.  Yeah, at night.  They were kind of dressed up in cooler clothes. 
[00:43:00]  There was one chick that was pretty tall in a little skirt.  Pretty hot.  Yeah.  And then there was a little one that looked like she was 10 years old.  She put her hair down.  That was all right.  And there was a waitress walking around or something that had the black pants that were pulled way down on her hips.  And she was kind of looked like she was drunk and she was dancing and stuff.  Really hot.  Yeah.  So, you know, it looked like it could have been a really good party.  But it wasn't a celeb-packed event.  No, we don't really care about those events.  No.  We never have.  It's just funny.  We like to, you know, go to these things every once in a while so we get goof on it a bit. 
[00:43:30]  We're hoping to see Tyra Banks and you wind up seeing Tyra Iron.  We saw nothing there.  We saw nothing.  So, I don't know about you, but man, all of a sudden, like, the sun went down.  Because the party started really early.  It started like 6.  And 7 o'clock rolled around and I'm like, I start panicking.  I'm like, it's bedtime.  That's what blows.  You start panicking when the sun goes down when you do this morning show. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, you're like a vampire.  It blows.  I love going to parties.  I like hanging out.  I could get a few in me.  And believe me, I'll be chatting it up with everybody.  Having a good time.  There was a whole display of a brand new NVIDIA video card.  That bunch of people around.  They had this huge screen and a graphic playing.  That was amazing.  The new NVIDIA 6800.  I would have loved to have stood up, walked 10 feet, and listened to the presentation and seen the card and everything. 
[00:44:30]  Because I'm really into that.  High-tech stuff and video gaming.  I couldn't get up.  I was sitting like a lump of crap on a log.  Yeah, you didn't move.  I didn't budge.  At one point, I did stand up to try to be social.  And all of a sudden, my sweatshirt that I was holding pretty much went up.  Oh, that was great.  Opie stands up.  He's kind of looking around.  He's holding his sweatshirt over his arm like you would just fold it over your arm. 
[00:45:00]  I'm not focused.  I'm like so out of it in a complete haze.  And you know these parties, are they?  They're the very small little tables.  And there's candles everywhere.  Well, Opie is standing with his sweatshirt over his arm.  And the sweatshirt is dangling over a candle.  And I see it start smoking.  Like, oh.  I had no idea.  Ope.  Yeah.  Ope.  So then Anthony like snuck out.  And everyone's like, where did Anthony go?  I'm like, oh, he went to have a cigarette.  Yeah.  Go have a smoke. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  That's the lingo for he's going home.  I gotta go.  Because normally I would sit there.  I tried drinking down one Jack and Ginger.  And I, it was like I was nursing it.  I couldn't get going.  I couldn't get into party mode because I was exhausted.  And it sucks.  I love parties.  It stunk.  And the area, oh my God.  Ben, what area is that?  That, well, that isn't even Chelsea.  I don't know what the hell that is. 
[00:46:00]  They like to call that Chelsea Heights to be nice.  I got out of the cab and all I saw was residents of the neighborhood  jumping up and down on Samsonite luggage.  It's awful.  Throwing it.  And they couldn't break the luggage.  I was stunned.  It was great luggage.  29th and the West Side Highway where they park all the buses and stuff.  Yeah, it's the bus parking.  It's Ruby Falls.  It's where the shwoogies intersect with the strawberry cowboys.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  Right?  The space is great.  But the space is great where it was.  But I told you, I told Anthony on the way out.  I'm like, whatever you do, take a left and go get a taxi as soon as you can. 
[00:46:30]  Don't go right.  He tells me don't go right.  Yeah, stay on the road.  Stay off the moors.  Yeah, never go right.  Where was it?  What and what?  It was on 29th between 11th and 12th.  Yeah, it was in that weird area, man.  Well, right when we pull up, the first thing we see is a big bus, city bus,  is making a turn, making a right turn.  But I didn't see that part of what you're about to say.  Oh, this is great.  You didn't see it?  No, I saw the aftermath. 
[00:47:00]  All I heard was a guy yelling and screaming like he just got stabbed.  Yeah, that's what I heard.  I didn't know what was happening at first.  Oh, all right.  This guy is banging with both fists on the door of the bus.  I do believe he was a dot head.  Yeah, yeah.  He's screaming, though.  Screaming and yelling and screaming.  Like that man scream when only horrible things are happening.  You'll hear the man scream.  Like if he's getting a knife plunged in his chest.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Let me correct you.  Yes, it's a man scream, but it's so horrific that they start sounding a little female. 
[00:47:30]  Right, that's what I mean.  It's that scream that a man only makes when he's being stabbed or his child is pinned under a vehicle.  Right.  So he's banging on the side of the bus doing, screaming.  So we're looking over like, oh, my God, someone's got to be under the tire of the bus.  Tire of a bus.  No.  And he's just banging on the bus screaming.  So we notice, as the bus is still moving a little bit, a car is also moving on the corner. 
[00:48:00]  The bus had hit the car and was dragging it.  Dragging it pretty much running over.  And this guy was the owner of the car.  Yeah.  He was in it.  He had jumped out when the bus started running it over, and he's banging on the side of it.  And the bus keeps moving.  It was hysterical once you realized, you know, no one was under the wheel.  And the city bus driver could give a crap.  Oh, they don't care.  He got dragged?  He's like, what?  It was dragging the bus.  Yeah, what a doodle.  No wonder they drag cars behind buses.  Yaddle doodle-y.  What fired?  Not me. 
[00:48:30]  Yaddle doodle.  Yeah.  It was the guy.  So he's pounding on the bus, and his car is being dragged.  You know, the city bus driver opens the door.  What?  What the?  Yeah, my God.  That's exactly how he sounded.  He was screaming.  It was man's scream.  I bet it was one of those taxi commission guys, one of those livery drivers or livery drivers.  Oh, probably.  Oh, God, I hate that.  Oh, they're awful.  It would have been better if it was this kid.  Under the wheels.  All right.  Well, and I had to leave, like you said. 
[00:49:00]  I had a room in the city last night, and I was asleep.  I went in and went to sleep.  Normally?  Like, Ben, how long did you hang out at that party?  I hung out until about the end, until about 10, then I went to a friend's restaurant.  But I was home by like 10.30.  I close parties.  That's my job.  I close them.  I'm the last one to leave.  Ben is like Austin Powers at these things, too.  You just giggle and laugh.  He knows everyone.  Ben is so at home at a party.  It's unbelievable.  He gossips little chatty. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, he gossips.  He likes to...  He works the room better than I have.  Cards.  Business cards are being traded.  Not his, though.  He doesn't have them.  No.  He didn't have his cards.  You are jotting it down on scraps of paper.  I'll tell you what, he was handing out yesterday, because he doesn't have his own XM Satellite  Radio cards yet, because they take forever with anything down in Washington.  It's unbelievable.  So we're still waiting for business cards for our guys, so they can hand them out when  they're out and about.  So he didn't have his cards, so he was handing out the escort cards to everybody. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, you are?  On the hottest...  Out of all my friends, that's the hottest thing ever.  They are all in love with those escorts.  Yeah, the escort cards that could also be used as a weapon.  As a Chinese star, you could throw it.  If you're in trouble in some of these neighborhoods in New York City, look at this.  It's razor-sharp metal.  It's a metal freaking card.  Yeah.  This will cut your neck if you need to.  That's a prison yard weapon.  Right.  That's great.  Oh, this opens locked doors very nicely, too.  Oh, that's right.  I bet it does very nicely.  It doesn't bend up like an Amex would.  So, yeah, Ben was just rocking and rolling.  He was enjoying himself. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  Your family was having a good time.  Yeah, I brought my brother and then my...  Cracked open that bottle of rum that was on the table, didn't they?  What kind of an animal?  Your brother just reaches over to the table and just opens up the bottle of rum.  My brother works on Wall Street.  He is an animal.  I never saw a bucket of Coronas disappear so quickly, either.  Yeah, my brother, he thinks Ant and I are pussies because he's been doing this lifestyle  for like 10 years.  He gets up at 3, 3.30.  Oh, he does?  Oh, and I'm sure he was one of the last to go home yesterday.  How does he do it?  I guarantee it.  I don't know how he does it. 
[00:51:00]  He hasn't slept in months.  You know, he just likes to rock and roll.  And then he invited my cousin out last night.  We've got to get him on the air soon.  He's a maniac.  He's one of these New York hipsters, man.  Oh, really?  He knows everything about this city.  He walked in.  I thought it was Moby.  I thought Moby came in.  You know what I love about New York?  I was saying this to him.  Yeah, you just take my face and just like shave all my hair, you know, make me bald and put  some hip clothes on me.  That's what my cousin looks like.  Pretty much it.  You know what's great about New York, though? 
[00:51:30]  Oop's cousin shows up.  You know, he's got the Moby shaved head.  He's got the bright red sports jacket on.  And he's got like Converse All-Stars and like ripped jeans.  Now, only in New York.  That's what's great about New York.  That's totally acceptable.  And then those guys picked up chicks in about two seconds.  They were gone.  See, that's the difference, you know.  And he was hanging out with his friend Andre.  Andre's like just huge in the whole, you know, spinning scene and all that.  You know, he spins at all the hot places in the city, you know.  And they go in the VIP room.  They knew within seconds that there was nothing going on there.  So they went to the regular area and picked up girls within like minutes. 
[00:52:00]  Your cousin?  Oh, yeah.  These guys are like real players, man.  These guys don't mess around at all.  Damn.  I think you've got my share of women with some smooth lines and clubs.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, man.  You pick up threes.  These guys pick up like supermodels.  So what?  Like it's nothing.  Like it's nothing.  They all make the same noise when you strangle them.  And my cousin, he invents all sorts of things.  Invents things?  Yeah.  He invented this contraption that you could smoke pot and no one knows you're smoking pot. 
[00:52:30]  That is a useful device.  Sure.  And I don't want to give it away.  Is it a smokeless pipe or something?  No.  No.  Well, I don't want to give it away, but you blow the smoke through this thing and it doesn't  smell like pot smoke anymore.  It's perfect for the dorm rooms.  Let's just put it that way.  You don't have to put the towels under the door anymore to make sure the RAs don't catch  you smoking pot.  What about the smoke coming off the joint or the pot or the thing?  He's got it all figured out.  Maybe we'll have him in and demonstrate his device because this guy loves his pot. 
[00:53:00]  I saw an infomercial for that on one of the late night channels.  Really?  No.  Oh.  Jesus.  I wouldn't be surprised.  Could you imagine that?  Yeah.  Smoke your pot, people.  Shark bait.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  That's loud.  Oh, that blew out some eardrums.  It was that loud.  Hey, how you doing?  All right, Shark bait.  Let's try that again.  What's going on?  I'm doing great.  How you doing, Opus and Anita?  All right. 
[00:53:30]  He was waiting to get that out.  Got as good a reaction as my banker lined in.  Shark bait.  We're a little slow, so we're hoping that you guys have a little more energy today.  So come on.  Let's get right to the point.  Go.  All right.  It's not pickle part.  It's pick a part.  It's a what?  It's a pick a part.  Pick a part.  You know, like one of those jump yards where you go with your own tools and get your engine  parked the heat for the rest areas.  It's picky part, not pickle part.  Oh, we've...  I say punch out now. 
[00:54:00]  All right.  We're going to punch out.  All right.  I say punch out.  He was going nowhere.  Robin from Florida.  What's up?  Robin.  Wow.  What happened to the phones?  Robin.  So, yeah, that party was a disaster last night.  But it looked like it was a cool party and all.  It was one of those parties that would have been great with a lot of booze in you.  Like, you've got to kind of be drunk.  And then you talk to people.  You kind of mingle around.  You, you know, make those network connections like Ben does. 
[00:54:30]  But when you're exhausted, tired, because you've been up since 3 at the 3.30 in the morning,  and you can't get one drink down you, what a faggot I've turned into.  What are you having?  Those parties stink.  No, I kind of like parties.  Like, I, you know, any kind of party.  I don't care.  Like, listening to those guys earlier, the phone call where they're all 3.30 in the morning out there,  and they're playing poker and stuff, that's great stuff.  Well, the house parties are much better than one of these, like, nip joints.  You know the table is full of beer cans and smoking butts and playing poker. 
[00:55:00]  They've got the card table out.  They don't care about work in the morning.  No.  Why do we have to care about work in the morning?  I don't know.  I kind of like being retired.  How long have we been back on?  Two weeks?  Two weeks.  Two weeks, and it's like, oh, it's ruined my lifestyle.  I'm already starting to try to figure out how we can take a day off.  Oh.  I'm just like, hmm.  But the worst thing is.  What do the listeners understand that we're going to take a day off?  The worst part of it is a day off for what?  To sleep. 
[00:55:30]  I know.  This weekend is just a sleep fest for me, without a doubt.  Fridays, you're still tired because you've done the show.  So you can't go out Friday night unless you sleep after the show.  And there's a baseball game, too.  Yeah, there's a ball game now.  And then Saturday, I guess you could do whatever you've got to do Saturday, but you're so screwed up from sleep Friday, you can't even enjoy Saturday.  And then Sunday, forget it.  You don't want to sleep on Sunday.  Yeah.  Because then you won't be able to sleep Sunday night.  You won't be able to sleep Sunday night.  That's what it is.  You can't go out Saturday because you can't sleep late on Sunday. 
[00:56:00]  It's a bigger problem than that, though.  We've got to, like, our bodies have to adjust to this.  Body clock, like you said before.  The body clock has to adjust.  You can't just, like, you can't just sleep all day Sunday and think that's going to solve the problem that we're all going through right now.  No.  This is the growing pains of waking up early.  Oh, it stinks until I'm tired.  My throat hurts.  You're getting sick now, right?  You're getting that thing that everybody went through?  Last night for two hours, I'm trying to sleep, and it's just swallow, ouch, swallow, ouch.  Oh, I hate that.  It feels like a ball of snot is in the back of your throat, and you just can't get it down. 
[00:56:30]  You think one good gulp is going to get rid of that sore throat for the night?  Yeah, ain't going to do it.  Not at all.  When I popped on the leave, I would have had a better luck eating a sea urchin.  That did nothing to help my sore throat.  No, you're done.  You're the next one.  Yeah.  It started with Anthony.  This is the first day I actually feel 100%.  Was your body achy?  My back's like a little achy.  All my joints achy, and no, I got it from filthy engine chips at Foxwoods.  Nah, it's going around.  Filthy chips.  Even Master Poe has it. 
[00:57:00]  Master Poe's got the...  He had something.  He had it, but he kicked its ass and threw it out of his body.  Came and went and he evacuated it.  With his own fingers.  He put his fist down his own throat, pulled it out, and punched it.  Love that guy.  Oh, by the way, we forgot to mention, the only reason we went to the Sink magazine party,  and we do love the folks over there, and we're going to do some stuff with them with the radio show,  was for the free stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  Where's our free stuff?  Where is that, Ben?  Aren't we supposed to get gift bags?  It's getting delivered.  These party gift bags that, you know, you go to these parties, you get a gift bag. 
[00:57:30]  The gift bag that you guys are getting.  And this one's got some cool stuff in it.  What's in the gift bag?  Tevo.  Tevo.  An MP3 player, a phone that's not even out yet.  Wow.  All night, but I called because Ope was bringing his brother.  I was making sure it was cool to bring his brother, and like,  oh, we're just going to send the baskets over to the office for you guys tomorrow.  And I knew the only reason Anthony was calling was for the gift bag.  No, I really would have liked to have partied a little bit.  You're such a liar.  You know I like partying. 
[00:58:00]  I would think Ope would be there for just the free stuff.  No, you're such a liar.  I know you like to party.  Uh-huh.  You walked in.  I could tell you were tired.  Yeah.  You went to the VIP section, okay?  You sat down.  One drink.  And you knew very early on you weren't getting your gift bag,  and I could tell that your mood changed.  You're such a liar, dude.  I was trying to enjoy myself.  And then the realization happened.  You're like, wait a minute.  We're not getting crap for this. 
[00:58:30]  And I looked at the night watch.  And I sunk up.  We're like, all right, what time are you going to sneak out?  I'm going to try to make it to 8 o'clock.  I don't even think you made it to 8.  I didn't make it to 8.  I was out at a quarter to 8.  Quarter to 8, I'm out taxi.  A taxi cab, please.  Here's what the worst part about being in a VIP is,  when nobody cares about you when you're there.  Like when you're in VIP, but they still know that you're just a schmuck who's in VIP.  I've been VIP in Vegas.  Nobody pays attention to me.  It's like you keep waiting for someone to remove you from the area. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, just to go, oh, you belong here.  Would you like any girls?  Oh, no.  They just kind of walk by and look at me like,  who's fat tits in the VIP area?  It's awful.  Whose friend are you?  I didn't go to the VIP area thinking I was cool.  I went to the VIP area thinking, wow, look what we could check out.  And we got to check out nothing.  Yeah.  Those clubs suck.  You never meet a chick unless you got to look like with the red jacket,  the ripped jeans, the sneakers.  That's right.  It's true.  You need a certain look.  I don't have it for those dumb clubs.  You're dressed very nice today, Jim.  Well, I'm snazzily dressed because of the Donald Trump roast. 
[00:59:30]  You know who's hosting that event?  I don't know who's hosting it.  Regis.  Oh, yeah, Regis.  Regis.  Yes.  Maybe you could get him to sing this song.  Oh.  Hold on.  I can never remember that tune.  What's that?  I've got so many tunes in my head.  How can you not remember?  I can't get it out of my stupid head.  Let's see if this works today.  We've got a couple of tarts.  Yeah.  It's going to be at the Donald Trump roast.  I'm hosting the event.  You make me feel so young.  Me and Jim Norton is going to be there. 
[01:00:00]  And Rich Voss.  You make me feel so spring has sprung.  There it is.  And every time I see you grin.  You're going to be hosting the event.  I'm such a happy individual.  And believe me, when I...  Well, the moment that you speak...  I was just going to interrupt with another non-funny thought.  Another statement.  Yeah, we might have to send you home today.  I'm tired, dude.  I've stunk for the last three days.  You think I don't know that?  I'm dead weight.  You got rave reviews for Tough Crowd last night.  Yes, you did. 
[01:00:30]  I felt very good on Tough Crowd, but I just...  In studio, I have been a fucking brick in the swimming pool just sitting here.  No.  No.  We've gotten some very, very kind reviews for your performance on the program.  Yeah, I'm just very tired.  I'm just very tired.  There was that line yesterday.  Yesterday, um...  Yeah.  This is why you have no friends.  What was that?  Um...  No, but then Wednesday, when you were talking about, um...  Hmm.  Hmm.  Yeah.  That thing.  I remember that.  I think there was something that you said in my mind.  Wait, no, um...  Thursday? 
[01:01:00]  Yesterday, maybe?  No?  Tuesday.  Near the end of the show?  It was a very good Tuesday.  Tuesday?  And what was that?  I don't remember.  That's true.  I always, like, wipe it out from day to day to come in and be fresh for the next show.  Yeah, make me feel so young.  All right, this guy, you know, we deserve this, and then we'll take a break, and we'll  regroup.  It's Steve from PA.  What's up, Steve?  You guys are crying like pussies about sleep.  Truck drivers, we drive trucks, get three hours of sleep, get back, and drive another  600 miles.  Well, we don't think we could do crystal meth in a radio show, bro.  Yeah. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, we got piss tests to worry about.  Really?  Well, if you're back in Boston, I don't think your old buddy Rocco or Greg Hill will be crying  about sleep.  Hey, dude, shut up.  Whatever happened to that fat bastard?  He was fired from a few stations that he tried to hook up at, and then we just haven't  heard from him.  Yeah, he's kind of disappeared.  I heard, last I heard, he was selling cars or something.  Yeah, you can actually hear his spots on AAF.  That's the funniest thing.  It's, hey, it's Rocco.  Come down here to Kia Auto, whatever the hell he's selling.  Yeah, I'm selling Kia's. 
[01:02:00]  Someone knows why Jim Norton is sick.  Yes, Joe.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Welcome back.  It's been a long time since I've had so much fun again in the car.  Morning, Joe.  Thanks for calling the program.  Jimmy, I'm wondering if you're making a connection between the sore throat you have today and eating  a little ass on Wednesday.  That's right.  You were eating ass the other night.  Oh, please.  I laugh.  I laugh at ass eating.  No, I'm sick because these two disease factories across from me have both been sick for two  weeks.  Yeah, he's licking hooker ass, and me and Opie are the ones that get you sick. 
[01:02:30]  We haven't even touched you.  We haven't even given you a fist or a handshake, and you're licking ass.  Well, we're all talking into microphones.  Believe me, that's what it is.  It's going around.  I mean, I could see the illness germs that you have in you now, just like hanging onto  her asshole, seeing your tongue coming over, going, quick, jump, jump across.  We can get out of this asshole.  And they just all, doink, doink, jumped over, off the bunghole, right onto Jimmy's tongue, 
[01:03:00]  and that's it.  It's like the Cubans trying to make it to America.  Yeah, they're floating over on tubes through bodily fluids.  Whoa, we made it.  Quick run for the beach.  Great to have you back, guys.  I got a new reason now to hang out in the tool shed with the XM radio.  There you go.  Thank you.  The germs are on inner tubes, and that girl's ass trying to make their way to America.  Making their way over.  To America.  Kissing the tongue they land on.  Oh, thank God we're out of there.  Let me punch y'all on my head, guys. 
[01:03:30]  Bye, fella.  Hey, look, that guy just woke us the fuck up, man.  I don't like the fact that you're implying that her asshole cold is behaving like Ilion  Gonzalez and leaping into my eager, stupid mouth.  It was.  You don't know what's dangling down there?  You're digging right in like a pooch.  Oh, dude, I was like a fucking baby wipe.  I was right in.  Ass equals Cuba.  Your mouth equals America.  Yep.  You're Florida.  Oh, that's hilarious. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, my tongue is even shaped like Florida.  Like Florida, right.  I'm trying to find.  You got the little Cuban ass and little germs making their way over.  You have no coast guard around your lips to protect it.  My throat hurts.  It was done.  And now your throat hurts.  That's terribly.  It's just going to get worse.  Well, how did Ope get sick?  How did Ant get sick?  We know how.  We got sick.  I got sick from dirty chips at Mohegan Sun in Foxwoods.  I know it.  Okay.  And I got some hacking towel head sitting next to me.  And I got screwing up the whole table.  A sand golfer? 
[01:04:30]  Hitting on a 13 when the dealer's showing four, you stupid fuck.  God, I hate that.  Oh.  Why do you hate that?  Because it'll bust the dealer, right?  Let the dealer bust.  These idiots that think one guy.  This guy comes over.  Now, I was finally sitting at a table where everyone knew their place and what to do.  This guy comes over out of nowhere.  He's drunk off his ass.  He's got chips in his hand.  He puts them down.  He pulls a 14.  The dealer's showing something low. 
[01:05:00]  Two, three, four, whatever.  He pulls a 14.  He's all drunk.  He just puts his chips down right before the deal.  Pulls a 14.  Everyone's waiting.  You know, stick, stick, stick.  He goes, hit me!  Boom!  Picture card.  He busts.  Walks away.  He was there just long enough to screw everyone up because the dealer hit.  Would have busted if it wasn't for this idiot that came over.  You want to kill these people.  And they're usually Asian.  But this guy was just a drunk, stupid white guy.  You've got to be a team player when you're playing.  It's a team effort.  If you don't know how to play, go somewhere else. 
[01:05:30]  Play the slot machines, you old bastard.  Was the Asian happy or sad or you couldn't tell because you were only looking right at  his face?  Jimmy, I couldn't even tell.  It was like he was emotionless.  They have the best poker.  Fucking yellow mummies.  They have the best poker faces.  Anthony, what did he get?  Did he get a good deal or not?  Right.  I don't know.  He could be sitting on pocket rockets.  You know.  Could have big slick.  Anthony, I was going to have a surprise for you, but I think I've got to talk about it 
[01:06:00]  so we can maybe make this happen.  I hate surprises.  I love a surprise.  No, it's a good surprise for you, though.  Yeah?  We're trying to get you into the World Series of Poker.  Oh, that would be great.  See, I knew that would be a good surprise for you.  Yeah.  We're actually working really hard in Washington to get you in the World Series of Poker.  I would absolutely play in that.  And we would be playing with XM Satellite Radio's money.  Oh, fantastic.  What is it?  Is it like you have to have $10,000 or something in it?  $10,000 to get in.  We're trying to get you in.  And there's a couple of thousand people that play. 
[01:06:30]  We're trying to get you into the World Series of Poker.  Whittles down to the final table.  And the winner, the last one that just ended, got $5 million.  Right.  It was going to be a surprise, but maybe if we talk about it on the air, maybe that'll  help us get you in there.  Let's work on that because I'm a hold-em-playing fool.  All right.  I love it.  Well, in honor of the diseases and the germs jumping from...  Girls' anuses into Jim's mouth.  Into Jimmy's mouth.  That's not true, ladies.  Those girls I'm going to try to hook up with are going to think, I have asshole germs in 
[01:07:00]  my teeth.  This is called a radio seg.  Just enjoy it, okay?  In honor of that.  Sit back and enjoy.  Sorry.  In honor of that, there's a little song that Anthony sung a while ago with his brother,  Drown Cuban Drown.  Oh, remember that one?  We'll break this out on the new show and we'll continue.  Drown, drown, Cuban Drown, Drown, Cuban Drown.  Yeah, Cuban Drown, Drown, Drown, Drown, Cuban Drown.  Turn around.  We hope you won't drown. 
[01:07:30]  Cuban Drown, Drown, Drown, Cuban Drown.  Cuban on your way.  Cuban Drown, Drown, Drown, Drown, USA.  USA.  Down, down, down, down, Cuban Drown.  Let's hear it for the refugees.  Give them a hand.  Prope the days just to open up a taco stand.  Twenty cubits float on a wine-bottle cork  Guantanamo Bay is just a five-minute walk  Turn around, only hoping we'll drown  Human refuge in the south of Miami 
[01:08:00]  We took all your relatives, stay away  Remember Ricky Ricardo, Babaluye  Look at Mamacita, she's as big as a boat  You'd shove a motor up her ass if you thought she'd float  Turn around, only hoping we'll drown  You'll be on your way to the USA 
[01:08:30]  Cuban drown, drown, drown, drown  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  Drown, drown, Cuban drown, down, Cuban drown, yeah  Give it round, round, round, now give it round. 
[01:09:00]  Coming up next on Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton sings, forget me not, you sightless taut,  your dog just shit on my...  Hello?  Yes.  Can I call, please?  This is Mike Matthews, a collection.  Mm-hmm.  I'm calling in regards to your delinquent account with Dr. Tom.  Yeah? 
[01:09:30]  It has been turned into our collection agency for the amount of $43.  You've got to be kidding me.  No, sir, I'm not.  No, no, no, hold on.  Let me tell you something.  That doctor had me come in about six months ago for a full physical, put me there in his  little examination room, told me to get naked.  I'm sitting there by the next day for about 20 minutes, finally he comes in and he says,  put this gown on.  I tell you, the gown had lace on it.  And he told me, finally, he said, he wanted to shut my prostate out, told me to bend over  so I'm thinking, hey, he's a doctor, he's going there.  I'm bending over and stuff. 
[01:10:00]  Checking my prostate, turning around, the guy had both hands on my shoulders.  I don't think it's damn bit funny right now.  He's in there laughing by my experience I've gone through.  Sir?  Yeah?  Your medical history is irrelevant, sir.  I'm telling you, he's not getting no money from me.  I went there to get a physical, told me to put a 90 on, I put, thank God, he took my prostate  out, had both hands on my shoulders and everything.  I can't even look at my wife the same way.  Come on, Bob's cutting the grass next door and I get kind of sexually aroused and I don't 
[01:10:30]  even know which way I'm coming or going.  Do you understand?  Have you talked to them over there?  Have you talked to them?  Yes, I have, sir.  I've talked to their...  Did he ask about me?  Sir, the doctor's not even involved.  I'm talking to their accounting department.  I mean, he's still jogging and working out the weights and everything.  I have no idea, sir.  He's getting kind of buffed there for a while.  I think he's got up a little bit like Brad Pitt.  Sir, is your good credit history worth $43?  Hell, I have a virginity for $43. 
[01:11:00]  Don't worry about that damn $43.  I may better call him up.  If he knew you were calling me right now, he'd probably be pissed because he don't know  that you're...  I'm sure the hell he don't know what this is all about.  Sir, sir, sir, your account is going to turn over to Ed.  It leaves our hands and goes into the lawyer's hands.  That's about your...  Boy, I'll tell you what, you're about as much pain in the ass than he was.  I'm going to go.  Screw you, buddy.  Heather.  The Maverick Minute from Maverick Business Consulting.  Welcome, I'm Bill Stark.  And I'm Dr. Marty Cohen.  And the subject we've been discussing this week is crisis leadership.  Yesterday, we spoke of five key challenges for a great leader during a crisis. 
[01:11:30]  To inform, direct, manage expectations, touch, and inspire.  Tell us more, Marty.  You can help people in crisis manage their expectations by conveying, for example, that  within what is possible, their very best is being done.  Messages such as this will help people maintain perspective and tolerate uncertainty longer.  And?  Competent emotional leadership also speaks to and about shared values,  those things that bind us as a company or as a community.  When we remind people what we're about, we inspire them to function at their best. 
[01:12:00]  And in order to do all these things, a leader has to be highly visible and visible often.  Speaking of crises, Doc, we're out of time.

[01:13:00]  When you hear the call, you've got to get it underway.  Word up.  It's the code word.  No matter what you're saying, you know that you're alert.  That's corn.  Word up.  There you go.  What the hell is that?  It's a truck horn.  I thought it was Jim Norton blowing his nose. 
[01:13:30]  This is the ONA virus spreading across America.  Thank you for checking out the program.  And thank you for turning this show on to others.  We greatly appreciate that.  This is to scare people driving in their car every so often.  They'll just be driving, have the XM cranked up in the air.  What was behind me?  You know what we've got to get?  We're still building the show.  I don't want to wreck it.  You know what we've got to get?  I know.  Okay.  And this.  Yes, yes.  That was always a favorite.  Yes. 
[01:14:00]  Those sounds are great.  It's too bad we have short-term memories or this show would have been a lot better by now.  So we actually need our fans to email us and remind us of things we used to do.  It's like, oh, yeah, that's it.  Like bits we should have remembered, Anthony, you know?  Some guy's like, when is Anthony going to start doing the Mike Tyson voice?  Oh, yeah.  And I remember reading that going, oh, that's right.  Anthony used to do Mike Tyson.  Yeah.  I need the bullhorn, though.  We haven't gotten a bullhorn yet. 
[01:14:30]  I know.  It's kind of cool how slowly but surely we add more things every day.  Cool is one way to put it.  Lazy is another way.  Lazy and we should have had it done is quite another way.  You get a lot of emails that say, hey, guys, you had two years.  Where's all your stuff?  Yeah.  Two years we had.  First day here, you should have walked in with a shopping bag with a bullhorn and some horns.  Right, all the little goodies.  You know, that's what makes this show so good, though.  We're just lazy.  If you want to remember what you used to do, just listen to the other radio DJs around the country. 
[01:15:00]  Ah.  Oh, are they hoo-hooing us?  I was in one radio station.  I swear to God, they did a bit.  And I'm sitting there and they go, yeah, that was O&As, but we had the same agent.  I go, it doesn't mean anything.  You can't just take their bits.  What do you know?  I don't like that you just decide to start talking without the big intro.  I'm sorry?  You really think you're a star now.  Well, I thought you were the intro.  The old days you would sit there in the corner and wait for your big introduction and stuff.  Now you're like, you know what?  DJs, I'm not your shine boy anymore, okay?  Let me tell you something, pal. 
[01:15:30]  I'm a big, you know what?  I got out of bed for this, okay?  I'm a big act now.  Oh, he put a shine on your shoes.  Forget about it.  Forget about it.  You're right.  You're right.  I should have just started talking.  I'm sorry.  Making his first appearance on the show, and so far it's better than Frenchy's first appearance.  Yes.  And Tom from New Orleans.  Yes.  All the people from the old days of the show have come back and tried to reprise their  roles on the program and have failed miserably.  Yeah.  Frenchy, after we attacked, and he's going to come in with Frenchy, maybe he should come 
[01:16:00]  in as Britain or something.  You know what I mean?  That's true.  He comes in, and we hadn't been on the air since the war started in Iraq, and we had  the problems with France, and now we get a Frenchy guy.  He's not a sympathetic character.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Come on.  No, it was going to trash me on that one.  No, it wasn't.  It doesn't matter.  I'm too tired.  I'm achy.  So I want to say hi to an old friend who came in fourth place.  Oh, my God.  In Lex Comics Standing 3.  Fourth place on a show that came in 178th place.  Yeah.  No, you came in second place, didn't you, in the first one? 
[01:16:30]  No, the first one I came in third.  I came in third.  You came in third?  Yeah.  Who beat you?  I know that stupid Dat fan.  Dat fan.  Ralphie.  Ralphie and the zipper.  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  That would make it great.  You know, I know you guys are kind of close with Ralphie.  Everybody is.  Yeah.  You have no choice but to be.  Stop it.  So are you going to trash him?  Go ahead.  Yeah, I was going to trash him.  I don't think he's all that funny.  I disagree.  I saw him at Caroline's.  He killed.  Ralphie sells out all over the country.  His race. 
[01:17:00]  Okay?  He thinks that.  So it's Rich Voss, everybody.  Yes, Rich.  It's so cool to be in here.  It's so cool just seeing you guys working together.  Be back.  I'm telling you.  Nah.  Last night, I mean, last night, I was, computers are so hard.  Like when you're trying to put a link on richvoss.com to sell your DVD.  Here's the deal.  I just wanted to do a plug.  Last night I was, here's the deal.  Oh, my God.  Here's the deal.  Last night I was with my girlfriend in the hotel room.  Right?  So she had a couple drinks and she's kind of buzzed. 
[01:17:30]  So we're fooling around.  I go, well, let me just write this thing for the roast.  Right?  I go, oh, man.  This is when I like her.  You know, because I might, you know, be able to get, you know, ballooned.  But anyhow.  Really?  No, I won't.  In my mind, I think I can.  When she gets a little drunk, you think?  Yeah, but she's just so, you know, she's sexier when she's a little buzzed.  You know, all women are, Rich.  Who is it?  They're always sexier when they're buzzed.  So HBO's on, I turn, and it's Taxicab Confessions.  Oh, yeah.  And the girl in the backseat's really hot.  And I turn, I look, I go, that's Brandy.  I used to fuck her. 
[01:18:00]  And I go, that's a girl.  I used to bang her.  Come on.  Really?  Yeah.  I go, I used to bang her.  And I go, oh, I mean, I know.  And she's on Taxicab Confessions.  Yeah, she was on Taxicab.  Awesome.  Way to throw a little cold water on you, a chance of getting set.  I'm on my own block.  Wow.  Yeah, you cock-blocked yourself.  Cock-blocked yourself.  Why didn't you just look at Tommy Morrison and say, we used to share a needle?  You idiot.  Well, that's something to be excited about.  One of the girls who bang is on TV now. 
[01:18:30]  So the girls on TV told me how she likes to give head and this and that.  I'm going, she doesn't like that with me.  Yeah.  Yeah, never happened.  Wow.  That's classic.  Nice.  Well, already a good story.  I'm off to a good start.  It was an okay story.  What was it?  We helped along with a lot more laughing than we usually do.  Okay?  Let's calm down a little bit.  When does that happen?  Jesus.  You got the Trump roast later on?  Yeah.  We're all going to the Donald Trump roast today?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:19:00]  All right.  You know, I don't know.  I mean, they flew me and her in first class.  They give us a nice room for two nights.  No, you know, everything's paid for.  Are you admitting that you're finally dating Bonnie?  No, no, I just know that I'm going to tank it and feel bad that I took all their money  and all their, you know.  You're planning on sucking at the roast?  Well, this way, you know what, I can't be disappointed when I do, but I don't set my  goals high.  That's true.  Good way to go through life.  Well, I don't know.  I think it's going to be okay.  We do a lot of roasts.  I did one on TV a couple of weeks ago. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, right.  TV.  You know, Jay, you know.  On Last Comic Standing.  Yeah, that was a good two and a half minute roast.  Some of those things were brutal.  Yeah, I got it.  Yeah.  Some people are just not funny.  Last Comic Standing, I really enjoyed the first one.  Kind of liked the second one.  The third one was a complete disaster and a horrible idea.  Obviously, NBC saw the ratings and they wanted to throw another version out there, but they  didn't think it through.  No.  I mean, how do you start a show three weeks after the other one?  I understand. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Because the interaction in the house and stuff is kind of what makes it, you know, kind  of fun.  Yeah, they should have just called this, you know, upscale star search.  You know, that's all it was.  Yeah.  Upscale.  Yeah, well, whatever.  It's because there was more comic.  Hey, we got the National Enquirer and every National Enquirer has OJ on the cover.  That's right.  OJ going to jail?  No, he's not.  His best pal finally tells all.  Yeah, whatever.  Who, Kardashian?  I don't think Kardashian's talking.  He's dead.  He died, bro. 
[01:20:30]  Took it to his grave.  Oh, when did he die?  What was in the bag?  What was in the bag?  He died, like, last year.  Yeah, he died a year or two ago.  Thanks for nothing.  He could have at least told us what was going on.  Last comic standing, producer.  This is in the gossip section.  Jay Moore is still standing.  Luckily, after comedian Gary Goleman slammed him into a wall with fists cocked and threatened  to deck him.  Why are you such a jerk, howled Goleman, who ranted he was sick and tired of Jay, needling  him and the other comics.  The pair were pulled apart before blows were struck, but Goleman's still grusing? 
[01:21:00]  Gruusing?  Gruusing?  Did he really say, why are you such a jerk?  A jerk.  Wow, that type of language.  I'm glad they edited that out.  Look, jerky.  So was there anything to that?  I wasn't in the room, but I heard...  Was airsick involved?  Was it another fake fight?  No, I heard this was real.  I mean, I wasn't in the room.  So what was the problem with Goleman?  Did Jay steal his material?  Gary's not a Bantriloquist. 
[01:21:30]  You know, I mean, listen, I guess it all came down from season two, maybe, you know,  he's just tormenting him, this and that, or...  Trying to make a little drama, I think.  I don't know.  You know, it would have been a good fight.  Jay could fight, though.  Jay's not...  Yeah, Jay's a fighter.  Guy was a wrestler.  I had Fight Club with Jay, remember?  He took me out in no time.  Yeah.  Kicked my ass.  Are we going to bring Fight Club back?  I was a bitch.  It's kind of... 
[01:22:00]  It's one of those things that you can't bring back or lose.  It just happens.  I think after we're here for a while, tensions build and people want to kick ass.  My best Fight Club ever was when I kicked the shit out of Frenchie.  Frenchie was bleeding.  I almost killed him.  He was a bloody mess on the floor.  You guys were cheering me on, and I just...  My mind went blank when I had my knee up against his neck, and his head was against  his speaker.  Remember, he was screaming?  He was all bent up, and he had carpet burns.  He had carpet burns all over him.  Well, he didn't get the carpet burns. 
[01:22:30]  I had him in this hold where I had my knee up against his neck, so his neck was getting  twisted really bad into his speaker, and he was on the ground.  And he was screaming, let me up.  I give, you know, all that crap, right?  And then he did the thing you never do in a fight.  Like, I had him.  Had him bad.  So I let him go because, you know, there was nothing he could do in that position.  He goes after me as soon as I let him go.  I'm like, all right, that's it.  How many rug burns did that guy have?  He was a mess.  He was a mess.  Most degrading thing, though, when you made him go in the train car to sign the surrender. 
[01:23:00]  That was wonderful.  That must be really hard to beat up a skinny French...  Oh, I know.  Trust me, I know.  It wasn't...  And his ballet dancer came in, and...  It wasn't that much of a challenge.  I've had...  Well, he had a fight with the other guy, didn't he?  I've had a lot of great fights, man.  He had a fight with another French guy underwater.  I had a lot of great fights.  I hope he's the only guy that could go on one of these scuba outings in the Bahamas, was it?  Where was it?  It was where we...  Turks and Caicos?  Turks and Caicos.  I went back there.  Everyone, you know, you do the scuba diving thing.  You take the course, and you go scuba diving. 
[01:23:30]  They take you out to a reef, maybe...  What's the depth?  30 feet?  No, no, no, no.  50?  They take you...  Technically, because, you know, I'm not certified, they take you down like 60 or 70 feet.  Oh, 60, 70 feet.  We definitely went down a lot further than that.  And, you know, most of the people go to these things.  They have a wonderful story.  Maybe take the underwater camera, get a little fish photography.  Opie gets in a fight.  Underwater.  With a guy underwater.  How do you fight underwater?  It's a true story.  It's like James Bond with a knife in his mouth trying to cut the guy's air hose. 
[01:24:00]  Well, what happened...  I was kind of experienced as far as these dives, because I was there for a couple weeks,  so I was like my...  I don't know, probably close to my 10th dive.  I was still in the minute of the Calypso started brawling.  Right.  I was doing like two dives a day.  I was really into it.  But every time you went out to go for the dive, there was like, quote, newbies.  I know I'm not, you know, but I had a few dives under my belt.  Newbies.  Like Opie's going down to the Titanic to pick up some wreckage.  I know, I know.  Newbies.  Newbies.  And they got... 
[01:24:30]  The day before, you were in the pool at the resort learning how to breathe through the  regulator.  Absolutely.  You're 100% right.  Day two, look at these newbies.  Well, that's the scary part when you go on these resort dives, though.  They put you in a pool and you're feeling real confident stuff and, you know, it's only  eight feet and you're underwater and you're like, wow, I can't believe I'm breathing  underwater.  This is great.  And then you think they might, you know, take you to the next step where maybe they take  you out in the ocean a little bit off the shore.  Where you would normally do the snorkeling.  Yeah.  Let's take you 20 feet out or whatever or 30 feet out, okay? 
[01:25:00]  You don't have time for that, man.  Oh, no.  You jump on a boat.  You ride for a good hour.  You don't even see land anymore.  Just away from land for an hour straight at full speed.  Yeah, because they're finding the reef.  And next thing you know, you know, the next day, you're right.  You go from the pool to jumping in this massive ocean.  Yeah.  Where you're literally only a couple hundred yards from the shelf where it drops down like  a mile.  Oh, you could look down and see that darkness.  Oh, yeah.  The scary darkness that the monsters come out of.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:25:30]  You could not get me to do that.  Call me a pussy.  Go ahead.  Pussy.  Yeah.  I just, I'm afraid of the monsters in the water.  They just, monsters.  They take a big step from the pool to the ocean.  So we're going out there and on the way out, like you said, it's close to an hour.  You know, they're going over everything.  I love how responsible they are, too.  The hour that you're driving out is called the booze cruise.  Not with the, oh, we got, we got.  Let's get all tanked up and then put the tanks on and get in the water.  What was that guy's name, the captain who was, like, banging the chick on the way back 
[01:26:00]  from the booze cruise?  Oh, she was, like, on her knees in front of the captain's console.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, she was blowing the guy.  Getting a blow job on the way back.  And there was a, oh, my God, that is one of the best stories.  That was Turks and Caicos, too, when we went down there for Sam Adams.  It's just nothing but drinking and sex.  Well, yeah, and they say whatever happens on the booze cruise stays on the booze cruise.  They come up with that one.  They have all these, like, drinking games on the beach and everyone gets just completely  gone.  Most of the people have to be held back on the boat. 
[01:26:30]  They're so fucked up.  Puking.  And on the way back, I remember that one guy who was driving the boat was driving extra  slow because he was getting head.  Yeah.  And remember what was going on behind him?  Like, nasty, like, storm clouds?  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah.  The ocean was getting a little nasty.  And it wasn't just you and I and the people we were with.  Everyone was pretty much like, dude, could you hurry up a little bit?  These clouds are getting a lot darker and a lot closer.  Yeah, he didn't care.  But he's slowing down because he's getting action all the way back to the resort.  Yeah.  So, anyway, we're going out there and they're giving instructions and making sure your equipment's 
[01:27:00]  okay and what to do if this happens.  You know, you really got...  The hand signals.  Oh, yeah.  You got to listen, right?  And there's this French couple, because Turks and Caicos, it's like half French, half English  and half, I don't know, Brazilian.  Stupid French.  The place rocks, actually, as far as Club Med.  And this French couple, they're just not listening.  And it was just pissing me off.  Of course, I do not need to listen.  They're not listening.  They think they're better than everyone else. 
[01:27:30]  Suck it!  And everyone's, like, trying to pay attention.  They're speaking in French, so other people aren't even hearing.  They're just being a major distraction to everybody.  So I take notice.  I'm like, I already hate those two, you know?  So you had a problem with them before you even went in the water?  Oh, yeah.  That's...  I'm starting to think it was Opi's fault.  No, that's the key to the story.  I mean, you know, these two people were assholes, okay?  So then it's time to jump in.  I jump right in, because I've done a few dives at this point, so I'm not as scared.  Because, you know, after you go from the pool to the ocean, you take your time going in. 
[01:28:00]  You're like, ugh.  But I jumped right in.  I'm like, I want to get right into the water.  And I go down to 70 feet or whatever it is.  And then they tell you, when you're down there, kind of just hang out and check things out  and wait for everyone else to finally get down there and get situated.  And then we'll take you on a little dive around the area, okay?  So I'm at the bottom, and I'm just hanging out, checking it out.  It's like being in a huge aquarium.  It's awesome.  When you, you know, relax.  And I'm watching these people slowly but surely descending from above, you know, nicely. 
[01:28:30]  The people that were listening are descending around me.  And now, hey, oh, look, I got a fellow scuba buddy right next to me.  Hey, how are you?  You kind of wave at each other because you're all happy.  You're in this whacked-out atmosphere, and they're checking things out.  And next thing I know, I look up, and there's the French couple flailing, out of control,  coming down way too fast.  French bread in their hands.  Right.  They're on a bicycle with a beret on.  This is a true story.  Like, out of control.  You're supposed to, you know, descend slowly, obviously, because you've got to adjust and 
[01:29:00]  blah, blah, blah.  I can explain why.  But they're coming down way too fast.  And I'm looking up, and I'm like, holy S, this guy's going to land on me.  I'm like, no way.  Right?  Sure enough, he just crashes into me with his flippers, and the flipper hits me in the  face, his body.  I'm like, I'm like, messed up.  I'm like, that's it.  So I push the guy.  I just push him.  How do you push underwater?  That's the best part of this thing, because it sounds like, you know, I'm such a tough  guy.  But, you know, try fighting underwater and see how ridiculous you look. 
[01:29:30]  You really get a good example of that Newton's third law underwater.  Oh, without a doubt.  So I push him, and it's all slow motion.  Fighting is what it comes down to.  So I push him like this, and he, like, backs up, like, two, three feet, because, wow, there's  a lot of power when you're underwater.  So then he, I could see the look on his face.  He is just livid.  And he comes after me.  I surrender.  Right.  It takes him a while to come back toward me, and I see him coming, but, you know, it's, 
[01:30:00]  everything's very slow underwater.  Pull the knife out of your leg sheath.  Yeah.  So he.  Cut him.  So he comes back at me and pushes me back.  I'm like, that's it.  Now we got problems.  So I punched him in the face.  You swung.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, it took forever to get there, but I said, you know what?  Don't move.  This punch is coming.  Oh, yeah.  So I punched him in the face and pushed him again, and then we just started fighting  and wrestling, and that's when I try to pull his air hose out. 
[01:30:30]  So now attempted murder.  You're trying to kill this guy.  No, I'm not trying to kill the guy, because we're only 60, 70 feet down.  Pull the air hose.  He's going to panic.  He's going to go up, and then I'm going to be able to enjoy my dive.  I think there's a problem there, though.  60 feet.  No, you could get up.  That's why they take you down only 60, 70 feet.  Yeah, you could go right up.  You have to be down there a long time to not be able to ascend.  Really fast.  I got la bins.  And if I'm wrong, don't call me, because we don't need the details of diving today.  But so then, yeah, he comes back at me, and we're kind of wrestling and rolling over and stuff. 
[01:31:00]  Fighting underwater.  It's a true story, man.  I can't make this crap up.  Only you.  And so then the guide comes down, sees there's a problem, and I think to this day the guide just thought we were both kind of just having problems.  Having sex?  Yeah, really.  We were just having problems, and it's our first dive, and we're a little out of control.  And it kind of separates us, and we go on the dive.  Monster rain!  The rest of the dive, I'm elbowing them and pushing them and stuff, and that was that, more or less. 
[01:31:30]  A little brawl.  A little brawl underwater.  A little Frenchie.  Did you make up when you came over the water?  No.  See, he didn't speak English, so we kind of just glared at each other above water.  Fighting underwater, see, with me, like, you know, after the fight's done, I'm fine.  You know, I got my aggression out.  I didn't really need to take it above water.  I just didn't.  But, you know, I just glared at him all the way back to the resort, you know.  Let's take this into the oxygen, pal. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, that's right.  Take it above water.  We're going to take it above water, so.  Was he staying at the same place you were?  Yeah, I saw him for the rest of the week.  The guy was just an ass.  He was just an ass.  People were wondering if you pulled off the Matrix pose underwater.  You could have done that.  I think it was before the Matrix movies, but you know what?  It was very similar, that whole.  You could do some cool stuff underwater.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And the skipper's getting blown.  There's a groupie for everything in this place.  Yeah, the skipper on the boat driving back from the booze cruise getting a blowjob. 
[01:32:30]  This guy got.  As we're ready to get engulfed in a storm.  True story.  This girl was completely hammered.  And the best part about it is because we all took a charter from JFK down at Turks  and Caicos, okay?  So you see all these girls saying goodbye to their boyfriends and husbands and all this  at JFK, and they all look normal, and they're almost kind of like in their business suits  and stuff.  God, within a day or two, they're just sloppy drunk in tiny, tiny little bikinis just getting 
[01:33:00]  action everywhere.  This one lady was blowing the captain.  And that same lady, I watched get back off the plane at JFK and run into the arms of  her boyfriend.  Like, hi, I had such a good time down there.  Big kiss.  You know, because all the New Yorkers go down the same flight.  So, you know, you see them down there, and then you see them when they come back up to  New York.  Getting salty captain seed all over her boyfriend's face.  Oh, this guy.  This guy rocked.  You just know every week, he's just, you know, seeing the new talent coming to the resort. 
[01:33:30]  All the Club Med employees down there.  They were all, you know, trying to pick up on chicks.  Who was the one trying to pick up on Sandy?  Oh, the circus guy.  The friggin' trapeze guy.  Yeah, she had the trapeze guy going after her.  The big black guy.  Right in front of you.  They don't care either.  Oh, they make it sound like, oh, hey, hey, man.  It's all good.  Their phrase is, it's all good.  It's all good.  That's supposed to erase everything.  Well, wait, it's not all good.  You got your cock out.  You got your cock in her ass. 
[01:34:00]  Wait a minute, what is that?  It's all good.  It's all good.  Not yet for you.  Not for me, you're stretching her all out.  We're all smoking illegal Cuban cigars and drinking the stupid rum punch drinks.  Yeah, it's all good.  But wait a minute, Kyle.  Your cock is out now.  When you're cocked at my girlfriend.  Now I got a problem.  It's now all great.  And these guys, all they have to do is sun themselves and work out all day long.  And, you know, you go down to like a club med after working your balls off all year long 
[01:34:30]  for your stupid two-week vacation.  You don't have time for a gym or to go out in the sun.  So you're just a flabby, pasty mess.  Yeah, you're a blubbery mess.  And you want to feel good about yourself.  You take your shirt off.  And these guys that are helping you on these excursions are like freaking supermodels staring  at your chicks.  This guy's a trapeze artist.  How do you compete with a trapeze artist?  He's all cut and he's doing flips on a trapeze.  And then they try to get you up there.  You're in the harness looking all awkward.  Your nutsack is coming out of your pants. 
[01:35:00]  And your chick is checking it out.  Wow.  She really wants to go bang you.  The guy that's doing the triple flip and catching the other bar or me, like, I can't even go  halfway without falling onto the net.  But the nice harness eases me down gently.  Yeah.  I look like a complete tool.  We were doing the basic moves.  I remember that it's like, you know, they want us to hang upside down and swing a little  bit.  And I had to tell them to stop because I was getting lightheaded.  The blood's rushing to my head.  Yeah, it's rushing to mine too, man.  Wait till your girlfriend come.  Yeah, I was, you know, I was definitely much more out of shape back then. 
[01:35:30]  They know the deal.  My beer belly's almost hitting me in the face back then.  And I'm like, oh yeah, yeah, my chick is so turned on.  They know how to make the guys look stupid.  And they know how to look great in front of the chicks.  And if there's any problems between the two of you, it's over, Johnny.  It's over.  I show my girlfriend, I blow him first.  The best part, you got to talk about the ex-Marine that now is like the captain on some  of these excursions.  Oh, he was the snorkeling guy. 
[01:36:00]  The snorkeling guy that did everything he told us not, told us that we weren't allowed  to do.  I'm an ex-Navy SEAL.  And now he's taking tourists out for snorkeling excursions on these little reefs.  Right.  And he was so serious about his hand motions.  If there's a problem, don't wave.  You are to take a fist and bang it on the top of your head.  Do not touch any of the sea life below the surface.  You are just to look and take pictures.  And then we're out there.  This is exactly how he talked. 
[01:36:30]  And it's not even doing a bit here.  He does this perfect sea hunt dive off the back of the boat with a knife in his teeth.  That was so he could secure the anchor, remember?  I will now secure the anchor.  He throws the anchor over his back and does this perfect dive into the water.  He turns around, winks to the girls, and dives off the boat.  And you're the blubbery white mess on the boat, and you're supposed to compete with this  crap.  Where'd he go?  Right.  And he comes back up with a huge starfish in his hands.  He's not supposed to touch the sea life. 
[01:37:00]  He's got sea life and a knife in his teeth.  It's like, oh, God.  This is some of the sea life you will see below the surface.  But do not touch it.  Only I know how to handle these creatures of the deep.  Freaking guy with slitting wrists and slitting throats in the nom.  And there he is, showing a bunch of flabby tourists with starfish and trying to fuck your  girlfriend.  Great.  That's exactly what goes on down there, man.  They're just waiting for you to fall asleep early. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, that's it.  Your whole deal, if you go to Club Med with your chick, is to try to stay up as late as  possible.  Oh, you just got to watch them.  Because, you know, come on, man.  I mean, you know, chicks think just like guys when it comes down to it.  They see these things walking around the resort, and they're hoping you're going to pass  out early.  Yeah.  Because at Club Med, you know, there's no time to go to bed.  People just stay up 24 hours a day.  I remember nodding off at the, quote, disco.  Yeah, the disco.  Wanting to go home and, you know, going back to my room and crash, but I just didn't trust 
[01:38:00]  these animals down here.  You wake up in the middle of the night, she's gone.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  She duck walks back into the room four hours later.  I love the smell of your chick in the morning.  Smells like my victory.  Sure does.  Yeah.  A couple Club Med stories.  I don't know how we got here.  Remember, I was married at the time, and my wife went skydiving.  Oh, that's right.  Tandem skydiving, where they're supposed to clip you into a harness.  But for some reason, they don't use a harness, he just has a boner, and she has to sit on 
[01:38:30]  it, jump out of the plane that way.  I remember that day.  I was on the beach, because I wouldn't do it, and she's strapped to a skydiver doing  the tandem dive, and I look at the plane, it's way up there, it's a little dot, and I see  them jump out, and I'm like, one, one thousand, two, one thousand, please don't open.  Please parachute.  Don't open.  Man, this could save me 50%, this could save me so much money, big canopy, shit, hit the 
[01:39:00]  water, hit the shark infested water, please, please, what are you going to do?  It opened.  It sure did.  How she was able to get a drink at 10,000 feet, that's beyond me, but.  This is the only time Anthony makes people uncomfortable in the studio.  Here it comes.  It happened.  I don't know what you're talking about, I'm not uncomfortable.  No?  The parachute opened, and so did Ann's wallet. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Made the same sound.  And she went, God, I had a big, huge snow shovel.  Pull that ripcord.  Here it comes.  Thank you.  What?  I believe if a woman's with a guy supporting him through his career, what's a little bit?  Yeah.  In here every day, writing bits for me.  Yeah.  She taught me the bro-caw impression.  Oh, man.  Someday we do have to get into that.  Mike from Staten Island.  Hey, Mike.  Hey, boys.  How you doing? 
[01:40:00]  We're rolling, so help us out here.  The Staten Island.  You belong in the dump in Staten Island.  Frenchy's actually on the line.  We'll go to him in a second.  The second appearance.  Go ahead, Mike.  Yeah, it's Mike from the old Save Eddie.com.  We were in Turquoise, you know, in Club Med.  Right.  And now you all eat together and everything.  You hang out in there.  And we're sitting down, like, six of my friends.  Some guys are staring at me.  You know what I'm saying?  These guys keep staring at me.  I said, what the hell are you looking at?  He goes, in France, only the pigs eat the corn. 
[01:40:30]  I said, your fucking mother's a pig.  And then we started this big brawl.  We got thrown out, like, the second day there.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  It was the French guy?  Yeah, because I was eating corn.  And he's looking at me and looking at me.  And I said, I said, what time is it?  I had to say something.  I said, what the hell are you looking at?  He goes, in France, only the pigs eat corn.  I guess French people don't eat corn.  Is that the...  I guess.  I said, your mother's a fucking pig.  And then I was like seven, and we just had a mad brawl.  It's what we're saying.  We got arrested.  Yeah, but don't you think that you should have handled that a little bit better  and maybe found out what he meant by it? 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, fuck them French.  I hate them anyway.  All right.  It's a French compliment.  I haven't had good experiences with the French.  That's for sure.  Because they're awful.  No one really likes the French.  And you know that the French don't like Americans.  Just the way it is.  They're jealous.  I'm very jealous.  And ever since Russia fell and the Soviet Union fell, Europe has been obsessed with  banding together and finally being men.  Why weren't you criticizing the U.S. when you were afraid Russia was going to kick your  fucking cowardly teeth in?  That's right.  Soon as the Cold War ended, Europe was like, ah, we don't need the U.S. 
[01:41:30]  They were petrified at any moment that the Soviets were going to take over their countries,  and they goddamn well would have done it if it wasn't for the U.S.  And now that the Soviet Union's gone, they're all one big happy family that doesn't need  us anymore.  With their faggity Eurodollar, one unit for everyone.  One jerk-offs.  One unit.  Ugh.  Fucking worthless countries banding together to be one good one.  Now they're all pals, but you could always depend.  Germany will screw the whole thing up eventually.  They'll do something.  Decide to goose-step into someone else's country.  Yeah, let's see some happy Jew in France and just attack the whole country. 
[01:42:00]  They're a bunch of anti-Semites, too, in France.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Uh, what?  Were we just talking history?  What?  A little bit.  Not history.  It's modern-day stuff.  What?  Yeah, it has an impact on where we are now with the French.  That's right.  Globalization.  Globalization.  Let's say hi to Brooklyn.  Yo, Brooklyn.  Brooklyn in the house.  In the hizzy.  In the hizzy.  One of my best friends works down at Club Med in Cancun.  Yeah.  Lives in the village. 
[01:42:30]  He gets more ass than a toilet seat.  Of course.  We saw it.  More ass than Norton's tongue.  Yeah.  We saw it for ourselves.  It was unbelievable.  All these...  They're called GOs.  You reminded me of that.  I see that on the screen.  Yeah.  These GOs, you pull up to the Club Med Resort, right?  And they got the drinks already flowing, man.  Oh, get them drunk quick.  And the GOs just all line up.  And you can see it in their eyes.  They're just checking out the new talent and, you know, who they're going to go after that  week.  It's like a drunken entrance to Paris Island. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  You get off of the bus or the van that they bring you in, and they separate you from your  luggage immediately.  They go, no, don't worry.  It's all loud, and they're like, come on.  Everyone's drunk and partying.  They separate you from your luggage and say, don't worry about it.  We'll take it to your room.  And I'm like, you know, they're like, aha, you Americans, you're so paranoid that something's  going to happen.  It's my luggage.  They separate you, pump you full of drinks.  Before you walk 10 feet, you're drunk.  And then they try to pump your girls.  The whole time. 
[01:43:30]  The whole time.  Well, according to this guy, his friend gets more ass than a toilet seat.  Why, are some of the girls down there like doorknobs?  Because everyone gets a turn?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
[01:44:00]  First week at XM Radio.  On what?  CD?  Yeah, they're selling our first week of broadcast.  Isn't it being rebroadcast?  Yeah.  How much do they want for it?  Well, the bid's up to $3.  $3.  Doesn't that pay for a month and a half of our show?  Yeah, that's what I don't get.  I saw a few of these going earlier in the week for over like $20. 
[01:44:30]  And at that point, it doesn't make sense because you get the service and hear the show live every day.  Yeah.  But someone's paying for it.  Oh, here's another one.  Opie and Anthony's first XM Radio broadcast.  Only the first show, which stunk, by the way, so don't buy it.  $3.99 it's up to.  Ooh.  And then this is the stuff.  All our old material, because we're not allowed to play it anymore, is selling like crazy on eBay.  Like hotcakes?  He almost said hotcakes. 
[01:45:00]  He came so close to saying hotcakes.  Selling like anything.  I'll say.  Opie and Anthony, 10 CDs, volumes 31 to 40.  Going for $15.50.  Then someone's selling DVDs of us.  I don't know where they got the video.  They're jumping off the shelves.  DVDs.  I'd say.  Oh, wow.  Opie and Anthony, XM Satellite Radio, week one.  Mm-hmm.  Another one of these.  It's up to $20.51.  That's what I'm talking about.  W-E-A-K-1.  It sure was. 
[01:45:30]  But at that point, it doesn't make sense to spend $20-some-odd on our first week of broadcast,  because that'll pay for the service.  Mm-hmm.  But someone's paying.  It just goes.  Be dialing, people.  Oh, my God.  They're already selling Opie and Anthony's second week at XM Satellite Radio.  $3.  It's a bargain at any price.  We haven't even finished our second week of broadcast, but it's already up there for sale,  Anthony.  Get a free Who's Your Daddy shirt with every order of the CD. 
[01:46:00]  Week one, people.  Week one.  Week one.  Week one.  Be dialing.  And the Maguire and Sosa rookie card.  This guy is smart.  Opie and Anthony, XM Satellite Radio, first and second week for $10.51 so far.  And then all our shirts are selling, the new Opie and Anthony, XM Satellite Radio shirts.  They're up to like $46 a shirt.  $46.  Be dialing. 
[01:46:30]  Radio promo.  You're not going to find this every day.  Radio promo shirt.  Rare.  Going for $26.  Autographed t-shirts.  Just goes on and on.  I'm trying to find.  Oh, here it is.  Autographed t-shirts.  The Opie and Anthony X.  I've looked at some of those and had no recollection of my autograph ever looking like that.  Who signs them?  Opie and Anthony XM Radio keychain.  Rare.  Rare.  Going for $10.  $10, those cheap things.  That we were passing out. 
[01:47:00]  I didn't know I had a rare item right in front of me.  There was about 100 of them.  Put your keys right on it, people.  It just goes on and on.  There's like 50 of these things.  There's wow shirts.  There's press passes they're selling.  Opie and Anthony ungag pass when we did the ungag special for XM.  Opie and Anthony stone pony road show poster going for a dollar, Anthony.  A rare item.  We got some of black girl's sweat.  That's really rare because she never does.  We should give them real stuff to put up there. 
[01:47:30]  You want like real items?  Man, I should have gave you a...  A bill black girl actually paid at a restaurant.  This is a rare item, people.  Earl's wallet.  It's welded shut with cobwebs.  Why don't we like...  Black bastard.  Why don't we grab stuff from our houses and put them up on eBay?  Personal items from the house?  Dude, I was getting ready for today's show and I staggered into my bedroom and I have my 
[01:48:00]  dirty clothes everywhere.  Opie's dirty clothes!  And you know, I've been sick for like two weeks.  German-fested dirty clothes?  So I got a pair of my underwear in my bedroom.  Oh no, stop it.  I'm not even exaggerating.  It looked like a used shoeshine rag.  It was unbelievable.  I'm like, I was wearing that and I didn't notice?  Like you checked your oil with it?  Looked like a two-year-old's crayon drawing.  Now that would be very funny to have a picture of that up on eBay.  Dude, I was so mortified.  Like a bit on it? 
[01:48:30]  I was completely mortified.  I went right to the sink and scrubbed this thing out.  I'm like, yeah.  Usually I just throw them away when it gets like that.  It was unbelievable.  I'm like, wow, I must have been really, really sick.  Sometimes when you live with a girl, you gotta, you know, do a little pre-wash.  Oh, without a doubt.  You can't leave stuff like that laying around.  It's just, you know damn well it'll just wreck everything.  Well, for $20, no one would have paid you to drop it on his chest.  Oof.  Do you wear, um, tighty-whities?  Tighty-whities?  Tighty-whities, um... 
[01:49:00]  What do you wear, boxers, Norton?  No, I just, I do the boxer, uh...  Boxer briefs?  Yeah, thank you.  That's what's happening.  Can't make the commitment.  The boxer briefs are what happened.  That's a good picture.  All right, will you stop showing pictures?  We're doing a radio show.  Oh, God damn it!  Oh, did he show you his penis?  His cock picture.  Oh, oh.  It looks like him.  It does.  It did.  It looked like you.  Except slightly taller and better dressed. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, we should auction off Voss's Mercedes, someone is saying on the phones.  All right, personal items from home.  How about Voss's cock picture?  They'd love to see that online.  You gonna let that get out?  No.  Get out on the internet?  Your cock couldn't drip out.  Let's say hi to Frenchie in Brooklyn.  Frenchie!  Hello!  How are you?  French people are the best in the world.  Fuck off, Americans.  You know, you French...  Yes!  We didn't need you in the World War II, so shove it, you faggot! 
[01:50:00]  You're all pussies and ingrates.  Yes, that's what French people are anyway.  Look at Frenchie all brave again on the phone.  You were in the studio.  We had a horrendous segment going with those Swedish game chicks, and you had nothing.  They were little bitches.  I told them that.  Oh, listen to them now.  Listen how brave he is now.  You're brave.  You know, I think we play all the shows from the week during the weekend.  You know, one of the shows, you'll hear Frenchie being the biggest pussy right in front of people. 
[01:50:30]  What did you think of that?  I feel like they're red socks, you faggot.  What did you think of those chicks, Frenchie?  They were nice and cute-looking, but they were hoars anyway.  Yeah, he said they were nice and cute-looking when they were here, to their faces.  Well, you know what it was?  He heard the accent.  He thought they were German.  That's why he opened the door and just invited them in.  That's right.  I love the Germans, man.  Can you find a dog for me, man?  They say hi to Rich Voss, keeping the Germans all strong with fresh strudel. 
[01:51:00]  Hey, what's going on, stupid?  Hey, what's up, you little dwarf?  What did he just say?  What did he just say?  What did he just say?  Dwarf, you fuck.  I'm a dwarf.  Dwarf?  Dwarf.  Hey, listen, today at the Trump Roaster, you guys care?  Are you making the pastries?  Are you doing the catering?  You half a faggot, shut up.  You pastry-popping douchebag, okay?  All right?  In two years, you have gone from pastries to danishes, okay?  You egg-clear faggot, shut up.  Yeah, you're jumping on my ass along with your tongue, all right? 
[01:51:30]  And if you jump on my ass...  Yeah, okay, you zero.  Listen to me.  You're in Brooklyn now?  You're working in Brooklyn?  You were demoted from Manhattan to Brooklyn?  Yeah, where are you going to go after Brooklyn?  Perth Amboy to make fucking jelly donuts?  You stink in any state you're in, stupid.  Everywhere you go, you leave a trail of stench.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Speaking of hot tapioca, I was going to clean off your wife's back last night when I was done,  but she likes to taste a bit, that double-jointed whore. 
[01:52:00]  Shut up, you creep.  Shut up.  I heard you and Norris are on tour, the co-emcee tour.  You both stink.  You make the pastries, and he smacks you.  Look at you, you stupid bitch.  What do you have for that Frenchie?  Let's see if Frenchie's got something.  Go ahead.  What?  What do you have?  What's your comeback?  He just talked all over you.  We're going to give you a couple seconds here.  I told him to take a tour in Germany.  You see how they're looking at him when he's going to be there, that little bitch.  That's it? 
[01:52:30]  Wow.  That's it, huh?  That's it?  That was kind of anti-Semitic.  That doesn't matter.  Are we really listening to the death of Frenchie?  I know.  It's unbelievable.  You better come back.  It's a guitar act.  It's in the closet.  Frenchie, I think you're really rusty.  You don't have those snappy comebacks.  It used to be good.  I was wagging him all along.  What are you talking about?  No, you weren't.  I destroyed you.  No, you did not.  I destroyed you.  Hold up a white tissue.  Here's the thing.  You know what?  Start off with a furnace, Shirley, and work your way up to the pros like me. 
[01:53:00]  Okay?  What?  You heard me.  I'm done with you.  No, I did not hear you.  You stuttered me.  I'm done with you.  I was going to let you drive me to my next gig, but you know what?  You're screwing that up right now.  Oh, yeah?  Give me a favor.  Don't do me any favors, you.  Do me a favor.  Don't do me any favors.  You really got me on that one.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Now it's Dr. Seuss coming at me.  Wow.  Always better than the Americans.  Don't forget that.  Do me a favor, and don't do me any favors while you're taking off the kid gloves, aren't  you?  Voss is walking in without a shot being fired. 
[01:53:30]  I'm telling you, I'm rubber in your glue.  Yeah, why don't you go back to L.A., you?  I'm sorry.  I'm rubber in your goo.  What?  Go back to L.A.  Watch out, Voss.  Next he might go, with friends like you, who needs enemies?  I don't get mad.  I get even.  Revenge is a dish, birth, serve, cold.  Slave with a white hat.  Oh, jeez.  Dish, birth, serve, cold?  When does your calling card run out?  Because this is starting to bore me.  Yeah.  All right.  You're done.  You don't have anything in between your legs, you stupid freak. 
[01:54:00]  Shut up and call Joey Reynolds.  All right.  There he goes.  It's Frenchy.  Oh, man.  Watch.  We have a three strikes, you're out rule on this show.  We've incorporated the three strikes, you're out rule.  That was number two for Frenchy.  Watch Ben's phone start ringing with text messages.  How was my appearance?  How was my bit?  I did good.  Your phone sucked.  He couldn't hear me.  I was rolling.  Rolling like the panzers over your country, jackass. 
[01:54:30]  All right.  We got Carlos Mencia checking in.  Also, we got to talk about Bill O'Reilly today, man.  What happened?  I brought in our Bill O'Reilly interview.  Oh, we have the interview that we did?  Yeah, he was very pompous and holier than thou with the sexual content of our show.  He thought it and I was all, we were all just about sex.  Turns out, according to the lawsuit that girl was filing, he's more of a wild man than we could have imagined.  You want to, um...  Mr. Dildo Sex.  You want to tell Carlos we need a little more time?  What? 
[01:55:00]  At eight or so on.  Um, all right.  Well, we'll figure it all out.  May I help you?  Yes, I'm calling about the job.  Uh, yes.  Are you currently working downtown?  Yes.  Um, I will...  Well, actually, I was cutting hair uptown.  And now I want to get there because I see what you say about the, uh, Wall Street thing there.  Right.  Now, I could probably bring in a lot of clientele.  Okay, um...  Yeah, I'll be interviewing all next week.  Okay, great.  Listen, what about styles?  What kind of styles are you looking for? 
[01:55:30]  We do...  Well, we do everything.  Right.  All right, look, I'm pretty far out there.  I've done some wacky shit.  I used to shoot people's heads up with Novocaine and carved grooves in their head.  I mean, if that's too far-fetched, you gotta let me know.  Well, first of all, we work on Wall Street,  so the people here aren't gonna be that wild.  Right, right.  I did a lot of work in the village, man.  I'm a fucking...  I'm crazy.  I'm a nutjob.  One time I gave this guy a haircut.  He didn't like it.  He kicked my fucking ass all over. 
[01:56:00]  If you want to come in one day next week, I'll be glad to see you.  Right, right.  As long as my appearance wouldn't bother you.  I'm carved from head to toe.  I'm a...  I'm a lunatic.  But I'll come in and we'll shoot this shit,  and you can see some of my work.  Okay?  No problem.  Do you want us to find him one day next week?  Whatever's fine.

You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals,  so let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel. 
[01:59:30]  Get a point, man.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Big hi to everyone that turned on their XM satellite radios overnight.  What's with this music?  You made a wise decision.  Ooh.  Isn't this the Bloodhound Gang?  Oh.  That's exactly what it is.  Bloodhound Gang.  Music to do Charles Nelson Riley impressions to Howl.  Figgy.  We got another trucker checking in.  It's Mudflap from California.  What's up, Mudflap? 
[02:00:00]  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  Yeah, I just got you guys turned on earlier this week  on my way to Los Angeles.  What you hauling?  I'm empty.  I'm back hauling to Las Vegas.  Well, God damn.  He's empty, Anthony.  I'm empty today.  All right, so what do you got, bro?  Yes.  I just wanted to say, don't go Frenchy off. 
[02:00:30]  Let him keep calling up.  I almost ran off the road listening to you guys making fun of him.  Yeah, people seem to like him getting beat up.  All right, we'll give him another chance.  Yeah, and in case he's listening, there was a livestock truck just passed me by.  I saw Frenchy's mother and his sister.  Wow.  There you go.  Wow.  They were spraying liquid pig shit all over my windshield.  Hey, are you at the front door or the back door? 
[02:01:00]  I'm at the front door.  All right, right on, bro.  Opie with his CV lingo.  Oh, man, this is better than trying to talk black.  All right, thanks, man.  Yeah, hey, when you talk CV language, after everything you say, say, come on.  Come on.  Come on, back.  Yeah, it used to be good buddy, but we all know what good buddy now means.  Right, I think it was what the other guy said earlier about the strawberry cowboys.  Yeah, the strawberry cowboys we learned about today.  God damn. 
[02:01:30]  All right, Mudflap, we're 10-10-10-8.  Sure is cold up here.  Over.  Is everything all right up there, Mrs. Torrance?  Yeah, bad storm coming.  Over.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  All right, make sure you turn off your squawk box and turn on the XM, all right?  All right.  There you go.  Jesus.  KDK-12 to KDK-1.  Pat from Jersey, what's going on? 
[02:02:00]  Hey, ONA, this is a great day for me, man.  I clicked on my XM radio, and I finally got you guys back, man.  Oh, cool.  So pumped you're back.  Hey, I remember in old days, you guys used to be some wrestling fans, and I just wanted  to know if you knew that Vince McMahon is exploiting retards now, because he has like  a hero, retarded wrestler in the ring now.  Oh, wow.  We might have to start watching wrestling again.  Oh, you got to check out.  Wrestling stinks.  But every week on Raw, Triple H exploits this guy, Eugene, who's a retard, and he comes  out, like, the clothes are all disheveled, and he can't decipher who likes him and stuff, 
[02:02:30]  and Triple H just exploits him every week.  It's the funniest thing, man.  It's worth it just for the retard exploitation.  Stop laughing at me!  Stop laughing at me!  You stop laughing at me!  And that's funny, Jenna!  Hey, I just had one more thing to ask you guys.  Old Dirty, man.  Where's Old Dirty?  Wait a minute.  I love that one.  You can't interrupt us when we play.  I know.  I'm an idiot.  I'm sorry. 
[02:03:00]  I don't think I'm really loud.  I don't think Old Dirty could afford the XM, so I don't think...  He should have stolen about 90 of them already.  Yeah, true.  I don't think he knows we're back on the air, or he would have checked in.  That's the problem.  Okay, terrific, guys.  All right, thank you.  Okay, terrific.  Thank you.  You want to get an update on the poker game before we move on here?  Oh, the Sacramento poker game?  Yeah, Joe, what's going on?  What's up?  Hey, bro.  Oh, wow.  Oh, what happened?  Uh-oh, the crash effect is starting to happen.  Yeah, the crash.  How you doing?  I'm doing all right, dude.  I'm up $150, man. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, you're doing very well.  I'm doing very well.  I'm still drunk, too, so that's cool.  It's now 5 a.m. in Sacramento, but you sound a lot mellower.  Are one of your friends asleep on the couch with I'm a dick written on his forehead?  Yeah.  Are you guys all standing around him with your hogs in his face taking a picture?  I never understood that one.  I always understood it.  That's why I pretended I was sleeping.  Dude, we're going to call you every Thursday night on our poker night,  and we're going to listen to you live at 3 a.m., man. 
[02:04:00]  All right, cool.  It's going to be awesome.  North rules.  North rules, you guys suck.  Thank you, mister.  Thanks, man.  They're a little mellower these days.  Dude, those parties, like, I've seen pictures of people's parties where they do.  The guy falls asleep, and they take their bags and put them across their noses  and take their junk out and put it in the guy's mouth and take pictures.  How gay is that?  How gay is that?  It's just really funny, though.  No, it's funny.  It really is.  Funny is stuff, you know, we used to do things, writing on the head. 
[02:04:30]  You know, you're right, I have a small cock, or would you please fuck me, waitress?  Because you know you're waking up and going to the diner.  And we used to do that to Joe Curry.  We'd write, hey, waitress, could you suck my cock?  And we'd wake up and go, hey, let's go to Dixill's Diner.  And he'd go there, and you'd be sitting there, I'll have the Romanian steak and eggs, hash browns,  and he's got, would you fuck me, waitress, on his forehead.  That's funny.  Or we'd tie his shoelaces together, shut all the lights out, 
[02:05:00]  and go to someone else's house to continue the party, and then call the house.  And he'd wake up, run to the phone.  It would ring for quite a while, but he'd pick it up, and you'd just hear, watch!  Because, you know, he got up and fell flat on his stupid, drunk face.  Classic.  But never junk in the mouth, never the Roman war helmet.  One of Florentine's friends, Tony, used to give crack finger,  which is when someone passes out, you put your finger in your crack,  and you hold it under their nose until they wake up.  Tony Bondi, I think his name is. 
[02:05:30]  Let's seg into speaking of that.  We've got Rich Voss in the studio, and he has to get ready for the big Donald Trump roast,  so he's got to leave us.  We've got to seg into the thing that's happening behind your ear.  We talked about it a little bit on the show.  Oh, this is disgusting.  Who was there that day in the parking lot?  It was me, Adam Ferrara, Rick.  There was a few of us, and we were all taking turns smelling.  Were you there, Norton?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, Norton was there as well.  And we talked about this on the air. 
[02:06:00]  There's something going on behind Rich Voss' ear.  It's just my left ear.  It's just the left ear.  What is it?  It's like a...  Dr. Steve from Tennessee told me it was probably some kind of a weird cyst.  Dr. Steve, the guy that diagnoses you from hundreds of miles away on a telephone.  That's why I like him.  On a telephone.  Did you know what he was right?  He was right.  Diagnoses other people's stuff.  He's been right.  You know what?  I will never smell anything.  No, you've got to try it.  No.  It smells like blueberries.  Yeah, I'm sure it does.  It does.  Rancid blueberries that a homeless man shit on, perhaps.  That guy was...  Your doctor has been emailing me, and he doesn't seem quite right, by the way. 
[02:06:30]  I called his office.  He's a real doctor.  All right, we're going to get him on the show, because he just doesn't seem right.  But anyway...  It sounds like the type of doctor that you'd get prescriptions from.  So what?  Dr. Decapolis?  He's Elvis' old doctor?  Yeah, that type of doctor.  I told him if he didn't give me a Viagra prescription, I'd buy the whole goddamn drugstore.  So what is it?  Well, I don't know what it is.  Is it pussy?  No, when I was young or out of high school or high school, I used to get cysts like these.  But sometimes, and they were big, like something would happen, and all of a sudden it'd break 
[02:07:00]  in the middle of eating or on a date or something, and the puss is dripping down the spine.  Oh, my God!  Right?  But it might be like the scar tissue that's left from behind it, you know, from having...  When you have a cyst.  You have a cyst, right?  Yeah.  I'm telling you this stuff.  Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.  And then, you know, you take it out.  I don't think I had the sac taken out of my mouth, and it just, I don't know, it gets  a smell behind...  But, you know, it...  It is the worst smell I've ever smelled. 
[02:07:30]  Get someone in here.  Get Steve in here.  Wait, you know what?  I don't even know if I have it this morning.  Shut up.  You always have it.  It's in your head.  So, we were giggling like little freaking girls, because we're all in this parking lot, and  we all decided to go for the smell one at a time.  A couple of us puked.  It was that bad that we were...  Like, I forgot who puked, but it might have been Rick.  Like, Rick starts puking, and then everyone just...  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  We're laughing so hard, we can't even breathe or talk, and then the next guy took a turn.  It was the funniest thing ever.  Why don't we chip in some money? 
[02:08:00]  Make Eric smell it.  Let's chip it.  Yes.  Make Eric smell it.  Bring somebody in, bring one of these kids at work for you.  Zach Bagel.  Let's see if I have it.  If you want to make Opie happy, you might have it.  Oh, I probably have it.  I might have some.  Well, I might have some.  Do you or do you not?  Well, I don't want to waste until he gets here.  Yeah, relax, or let me know the drill.  All right.  You just sit over there.  You have enough confidence that this is going to work?  He hasn't.  It's an unpunctured sack in his head.  I have a lot of confidence it's going to work.  All right.  Who wants to do this?  He loves it around like venom.  I've done it already.  Venom.  I hope I have some. 
[02:08:30]  I gave some to my girlfriend the other day.  Yeah?  She almost threw up.  No, it is.  I can't sleep with you ever again.  I'm not lying.  How would you do that to your girlfriend?  I don't know.  I just want to, you know.  Come on in.  Eric's very curious about this pungent.  Bring him in.  Steve, I want you to do it.  I've done it.  Me too.  I've done it three times.  Well, Eric can do it first if he throws up.  He won't throw up.  I hope I have some.  I want Ben to do it as well.  Oh, you will never get Ben to do it.  You want Ben to do it?  Yeah, he will put it on a mirror and chop it up with a razor blade.  Well, when there's a lot of it back there, I can get some oils and then you can see it on. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, this is the sickest thing.  Get a garbage pail.  I don't know if I have enough.  This could be a big gun.  No, he won't puke.  He'll just go, yuck.  This could be a very big disappointment or.  He won't have it because he's not sweating.  It's first thing in the morning and he's showered.  Did you shower already?  It won't be as bad.  You didn't shower?  It should be.  That's right.  You're going to go back.  If it's a sack.  All right, this is sex bagel, Rich.  I don't think you've met sex bagel yet officially.  No faking sniffing either.  Wait, wait, wait. 
[02:09:30]  Where's Ben?  Get right on.  We've got to close your mouth.  Oh, here you go.  Hold on, hold on.  Ben.  Oh, hurry, hurry, hurry.  Let him get it first.  Ben, come here.  Wait, get near the microphone.  Close your mouth.  Jesus Christ, you guys don't know how to do radio.  Close your mouth.  Oh, he's gagging.  He's gagging.  Oh.  Don't throw up.  Yeah, hey, hey, hey.  Oh, God, he's puking. 
[02:10:00]  Foss is like a skunk.  He's got a defense system.  Holy crap, look at his face.  Oh, my God, he's puking.  What do you think?  It's running out.  What is it smell like?  Sex bagel, get on the microphone.  It smells like rotten ass.  It's the worst.  It's so bad, dude.  You have no idea how bad this is.  This is so heinous. 
[02:10:30]  It's not bad.  It's not bad.  Ben, come in.  You don't have to do it, but you've got to help with the microphone.  You don't have to do it.  It's like, I'm not good.  Ben is not even coming into the studio.  Ben is not going to come into the studio.  Catch him before it goes.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  He's got to go near the mic because you've got to get the reaction because people, all  right, you got some there for him?  Take a sniff.  That is the most disgusting odor I have ever, ever inhaled. 
[02:11:00]  Master Paul has come in with a garbage bag.  Let's see if I got any left.  I got maybe one more.  All right.  You might have one more.  Wait, get near the mic.  Get near the microphone.  Here we go.  Close your mouth.  Close.  Uh-oh.  It might be wearing out because that wasn't as bad.  It's wearing off of his finger.  Yeah.  Holy crap.  Sex bagel got the worst one.  How funny is that? 
[02:11:30]  It violates your humanity.  It lingers.  It is the funniest thing, man.  We got to do that at our next road show or something.  Oh, he's wiping his finger off.  Now show us the paper towel after you wipe it off.  Nothing on it.  No, nothing?  Nothing?  I had like a mirror I could show you.  All right, dude.  Just throw that paper towel away.  Wow.  I'm actually getting nauseous because I know what it smells like.  I don't feel like doing it today.  Instant feedback.  Damn it.  Effing.  Stop it.  I'm going to throw up.  I have nothing like that.  The next time we're all on a stage somewhere, we'll do it to some of the fans. 
[02:12:00]  It'll be the biggest laugh ever because the reaction is just classic.  It's absolutely classic.  I might have some belly button.  No, you know, we've all smelled the belly button thing.  If you don't wash it, it doesn't compare, man.  You think so?  Yeah, it doesn't compare to what is going on behind that guy's ear, man.  It makes Voss throw up.  Like, he starts gagging when he smells his own rear ear sack fluid thing.  Did you see Sex Bagel?  His face turned bright red and he started puking.  He was like, you see him looking around for something to throw up in? 
[02:12:30]  Oh, yeah.  It violates you.  He was in the garbage pail and he was, like, relieved.  No, because you prepare yourself.  You think, okay, I've smelled some bad crap in my day.  You think, all right, whatever.  It'll be bad for a second.  No, you have no idea.  Like Norton said, it just violates you.  It hits your taste buds.  Make Trump smell it at the roast.  Watch him throw up.  It becomes a part of you.  That is some defense system you got.  You're like a porcupine or a skunk or something.  He's got a built-in defense system.  Someone tries to mug him or you should just wipe it, stick it under his nose. 
[02:13:00]  Or in jail, rub that on your ass.  Nobody will rape you.  Are you all right, Eric?  I'm doing better now, but it's so rancid that it lingers even though you're not near him.  You still think you smell it.  What does it smell like?  I'm taking a little bit.  It's almost gone.  No, no, no.  I'll be a guy.  I did it about two years ago.  Andy, want some?  No.  No, never, never, never.  That's something you do only like once a decade.  It's brutal.  Kev didn't take any. 
[02:13:30]  I don't have any left.  He has no sense of smell, Kev.  Really?  Yeah.  Why?  Isn't that screwy?  It was born without a sense of smell.  You don't know what things smell like?  You know what the best thing is?  When he drives you somewhere, you can fart in the car all you want.  That's great.  Yeah.  You can't smell anything?  That is the weirdest thing.  You eat pussy like you don't care where she's been.  Now, look, I've been doing jumping jacks in a horse table.  I don't care.  You can smell Norton's tongue and it wouldn't affect you?  How do you know it's a bad clam? 
[02:14:00]  You don't.  Wow.  That is weird.  All right.  Well, that was fun.  That was fun.  Oh, man.  That's funny.  It was Voss's first appearance.  That's right.  You did okay.  You did all right.  Listen.  You did all right.  Let's calm down.  You did okay.  No, I'm just saying how fun it is to be back.  Oh, good.  You know, like, it's just, you know, it doesn't even seem like the two years happened almost.  You know what I mean?  I rarely get serious with these guys in the studio, but I do have to say this, and then  we can goof on them.  But Voss had opportunities to go on a lot of radio shows. 
[02:14:30]  Yes.  And he was just showing his loyalty to us, and I just want to acknowledge that, because  there were other guys associated with the show that just went, ah, they're gone.  They're not going to be back anytime soon.  I'll just start doing other shows and this and that.  Not that we play that game, but Voss really, really showed incredible loyalty during our  time off.  And became a big star.  I'm not a star.  For a while there.  Hey, dude, I had to take all the pictures of the fat housewives in freaking Montreal that  wanted their pictures taken with you. 
[02:15:00]  Unbelievable reality fans.  It's just, you know, hot chicks don't sit home and watch reality.  No, it's all fat chicks.  Oh, right.  It's just little porkers, and they come, can I have a hug?  No, Pete, I got a bad back.  They come, can I have a hug?  They're just disgusting.  It was just the worst.  When we were at the Montreal Comedy Festival, and you're getting recognized wherever we  go.  I'm like, oh my God.  I was thinking to myself, I used to be somebody.  So these girls came up to Voss, like, I'm a big fan.  And then Voss is like, well, he's, you know, we're just goofing, because we don't really 
[02:15:30]  care.  But Voss is like, he's famous too.  And I try to explain why I'm famous, and they're like, oh, that's really cool.  Anyway, could you get a picture of me and Voss?  Here's a little hint.  Whatever you have to explain why you're famous.  Oh, I know.  I know.  Yeah.  Dude, it was the worst.  No, because I remember that.  Did you ever see that when I was the guy?  It was the worst.  It was the worst.  When he's somewhere, we were in Miami, where the other radio show wasn't picked up.  And when O&A wasn't picked up in Miami when you were on the air. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  So now you're really not famous?  Because even if you explain who you are, they go, oh, well, regional fame.  The Sex for Sam thing gave us a little name recognition.  Oh, that gave you, yeah.  That was big.  Oh, after we got the boot, I went to Tavern on the Green for dinner with some friends  and stuff.  Oh, look at you.  And it was during Christmas time, so they had the big Christmas tree up.  And I'm sitting at a table, and this couple walks up and goes, excuse me, would you take  a picture?  And I'm like, yeah, cool.  You know, I'm ready to get up.  They handed me the camera, stood by the Christmas tree. 
[02:16:30]  And I was close enough that I could take the picture, and they asked me to take a picture  of them.  I was feeling all good, you know, like, ah, I was recognized.  Oh, good.  No one has forgotten about us.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, great.  We can handle this time off.  Oh, still in the public eye.  Let me tell you what this clawed did.  They got no head, by the way, on that photo.  Bastards.  This idiot, we're walking out.  Can you not point that finger at me?  Okay, me and Norton, we're eating at some nice restaurant downtown.  So, I walk out.  You know, the waiter recognizes me in the restaurant. 
[02:17:00]  How you doing, Mr. Voss?  And it was a nice place.  Where do you want to sit, Mr. Voss?  Da, da, da.  So, I'm outside.  We leave.  And I'm ahead of him by, like, 15 feet, having a cigarette.  And some, you know, like, drag homeless person goes, oh, you're Jim Norton, right?  So, he had to let me know that he was recognized, too.  He goes, yeah, this is really tough when you go out and people recognize you, you know?  And he was like a homeless guy.  But, of course, you know, Mr. Voss, where you like to sit, you know?  Well, that's how well-known I am.  People without TVs know me. 
[02:17:30]  Hey, there you go.  You needed the bisexual servant to make you feel good about yourself.  Wow.  What a spin you put on that one.  Right.  That was a good one.  He happened to walk by a window one time, and what are the odds?  I must have been on TV.  That was a fancy place, too.  They had the duck and goose soiree.  Oh, the duck and goose soiree.  Hey, we were talking about the Opie and Anthony eBay stuff, and Echo from Philly writes, what  is the high bid for Voss's dignity?  Oh, that's hilarious.  Too bad we can't, like, webcam girls will send their panties. 
[02:18:00]  Too bad we can't send something with that finger stink on it.  That stench.  Through the mail.  To capture that.  No, the next time we do one of those live gigs, we'll make it part of the thing, man.  Fifty bucks if you smell it, and a hundred if you smell it, and then put it in your mouth  and clean his finger.  Ugh.  Well, if you want to see that stink again, wait till I get up on the roast.  All right.  I'm going to bring it out.  It'll be great.  It'll be okay.  Thank you, Rich, for stopping by.  Thank you.  This was fun.  I think we're going to step aside.  We've got to talk about Bill O'Reilly.  Of course we do.  I got a good roast joke for Voss.  Oh, you do?  I should open with. 
[02:18:30]  What's that?  Unless you look at his hair and go, what is that, a cunt on your head?  I got one for Sharpton.  The only way you'll make it onto the White House property is with a lantern in your hand.  Oh.  You're not going to break that out, are you?  Yes, he is.  I am outraged.  And he's going to be there, right?  Yeah, he's on the dais.  On the dais.  On the dais.  On the dais.  Wow.  Wait.  Oh, that's.  Is that one?  All right.  So when we get back, we'll talk about Bill O'Reilly.  No, I'm looking at my notes here. 
[02:19:00]  And what happened to the couple from Boston that wants to try to outdo the couple from  Tennessee?  Right.  They were supposed to have a little sex.  The listeners are part of this show.  If you guys promise us something, you can't back out.  No.  We count on you.  Indian giver.  Can we maybe talk about John Kerry referring to Chaney's daughter's mullet?  Is that possible?  Chaney's daughter is just up.  You know, you kept hearing about her.  I never saw a picture of her, and you kept hearing, oh, she's a lesbian and stuff. 
[02:19:30]  And I'm thinking, what the Bush daughters look like, only a lesbian, which is kind of  hot.  Looks like Chaney with a little more hair.  Just a little more hair.  Although she's also a Bush daughter.  Ha ha ha ha ha.  With that, let's play Brother Joe's Dry Vagina.  And we'll do a little news thing next and stuff like that.  And are you trying to get me?  Because you almost got me.  Did you get me or?  Oh, jeez.  Who is that?  Did you fart?  Voss is stinking out of everything. 
[02:20:00]  His fingers, his ass.  Yeah, Voss is little farts.  He's always like this.  Those little farts.  They're not men farts.  Mine are nice.  No, you got to get.  Where it's hot.  The type that are warm going through the plumbing.  Yeah.  They're warm on your thighs.  It goes up your shirt and you turn your belly warm.  Yeah, real bad.  Smells like an oil refinery.  I was watching Roots.  Where the back of your jeans puff up quickly like a parachute.  And then it's released through the back. 
[02:20:30]  I was watching Roots and Ed Asner was the slave ship captain.  And they're like, Captain, will you be needing a belly warmer?  That was what they called the girls they would bring for you to bang.  Captain, will you be needing a belly warmer?  What's up, Ben?  I said he has a nice glow to him, doesn't he?  Yeah, Ben, we don't know what's up with Ben.  Ben was out in his element last night, so he's feeling good.  He looks tremor.  He's got a glow.  He was out at a network party.  Networking.  A network party?  He was networking at a party.  He's like the young Austin Powers when he's out and about. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, he really is.  Ben networks with.  Handing out escort cards.  Ben networks with nobodies, though.  This is not what I wanted.  Thanks.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no, you're starting that.  Oh, boy.  No, this is cool.  Here's a little ditty.  This will do.  That's 100% carot, dude.  Dry, dry, dry vagina.  Dry, dry, dry vagina. 
[02:21:30]  So, before my penis starts to get sore, go pick up some badsy lube at your local drugstore.  Said go get some badsy lube at your local drugstore.  And here, as long as we're talking about theme restaurants, I got a proposition for you. 
[02:22:00]  I think, if white people are going to burn down black churches, then black people ought to burn down the house of blues.  Huh?  What a fucking disgrace that place is.  The house of blues.  They ought to call it the house of lame white motherfuckers.  Inauthentic, low frequency, single-digit, lame white motherfuckers.  Especially these male movie stars who think they're blues artists. 
[02:22:30]  You ever see these guys?  Don't you just want to puke in your soup when one of these fat, balding, overweight, over-aged, out-of-shape, middle-aged male movie stars with sunglasses jumps on stage and starts blowing into a harmonica?  It's a fucking sacrilege.  In the first place, white people got no business playing the blues ever.  At all.  Under any circumstances.  Ever, ever, ever.  What the fuck do white people have to be blue about? 
[02:23:00]  Banana Republic ran out of khakis?  Huh?  The espresso machine is jammed?  Hootie and the Blowfish are breaking up?  Shit, white people ought to understand their job is to give people the blues, not to get them.  And certainly not to sing or play them.  Tell you a little secret about the blues.  It's not enough to know which notes to play. 
[02:23:30]  You've got to know why they need to be played.  And another thing.  I don't think white people should be trying to dance like blacks.  Stop that!  Stick to your faggoty polkas and waltzes.  And that repulsive country line dancing shit that you do.  And be yourself.  Be proud.  Be white.  Be lame.  And get the fuck off the dance floor.  Now.

[02:25:00]  It's everything.  24-7.  XM.  202.  The O&A virus.  It's everything.  All the time.  Opie and Anthony, they are like chocoholics, but for booze.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Get up, get mung it down with the sickness. 
[02:25:30]  Get up, get mung it down with the sickness.  Get up, get mung it down with the sickness.  Open up your hate and then they know what to make.  Get up, get mung it down with the sickness.  You must like, get up, get mung it down with the sickness.  Hey, what's going on?  It's Opie and Anthony.  Ah.  Spreading the O&A virus across America.  Oh.  That's right.  That's right, Robin.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  All right, where do we want to go now?  I'm hoping that couple from Boston calls in. 
[02:26:00]  Well, that would be nice.  That would be really nice.  I think Tennessee started something that could really, really blossom into a classic ONA bit.  So we're waiting for the couple from Boston to call us.  I don't think it's going to happen, Ant.  I don't want to tease that because I don't think it's going to happen.  I think they're going to pussy out on us.  Really fast.  It's Dominic in Jersey.  What's up?  Yo, what's going on, man?  Hey.  Oh, man, you guys fucking rule. 
[02:26:30]  Thank you, my friend.  Let me tell you, I miss you guys so much.  Friggin' Norton, you're the man, dude.  Thank you, mister.  Yeah, it's so obvious that Norton's the man today by listening to him.  He stinks.  No, but I'm not feeling well, and I still came in with my...  You brought your A game and put it on Tough Crowd last night is what you did.  Getting rave reviews that you killed on Tough Crowd last night.  But it's all the same to me.  It's all a part of just the Jim Norton experience.  You sound a little sick now.  You sound like you're getting sick now.  Oh, yeah, I'm definitely...  My whole body's achy.  Yeah, the Jim Norton experience.  At this point in the Jim Norton experience, we're listening to the drum solo. 
[02:27:00]  Oh.  Even sick, and even achy, I am still...  We're hoping the bass player is at least going to join in to make it a little better.  I happen to be fun to be around.  That's never good.  And enjoyable.  That's never good, no matter what band does it.  Oh, it's time for everyone to do their solos.  Ugh.  I hate the drum solo.  I remember seeing Van Halen.  Van Halen was a classic example.  And it was like, oh my God, shut up.  Motley Crue. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, stop it.  It's like, oh, Tommy Lee's in the air.  They're spinning him around.  He's doing the drum solo upside down.  It's still a drum solo.  You know what that means?  We don't have enough shit to play.  You know who likes the drum solo?  Drummers.  That's it.  And how many are there out there?  Eh, not that many.  Cowbell.  Time for the bass player.  Shut up. 
[02:28:00]  That's when you look at your friend and go, uh, I'm going for beer.  You want another one?  We ought to get a drum solo for the show.  Like, halfway through the show, we could just throw on a drum solo.  Yeah, and then watch, uh, and see how many people are still listening by the end of it.  See how many people go to get that beer.  Everyone's going to get up and get that, you know, ONA concert t-shirt.  Go to the bathroom.  Oh, yeah.  Stand on that long bathroom line during the drum solo.  Uh, dude, you want to go, uh, smoke some pot under the, under the stairs? 
[02:28:30]  This should last 20 minutes.  Yeah.  You had to wait for, like, Jamie's crying to get beer, because then there's no line.  Or go to the bathroom.  You wait for the drum solo, everyone's out there.  Stop it.  Everybody.  My mescaline's kicking in.  I need to, I'm, I need to go to the bathroom.  I'm hanging up on a lot of people, because we're hoping that, uh, the Boston couple's  just having a tough time getting into the show today.  Oh, perhaps.  Jim from Buffalo, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  I can't, I can't believe I'm talking.  It's so good to hear you guys back on the radio.  You're, you're, you're, you're, you're killing your buddy Shreddy, though, because I'm telling 
[02:29:00]  you, I haven't turned him on.  I haven't turned his radio off.  Oh, cool.  There has to be some casualties.  Yeah, there's going to be some casualties in this whole mess, unfortunately, but, uh.  Well, bring them on board once they lose their jobs.  All right.  Thank you, Jim.  These are some funny guys.  Thanks, man.  Cool.  Spread the virus for us, because we're trying to get the word out that we're back, because  I, I just don't think a lot of our ONA listeners know we're back yet.  Spread that virus.  Although the audience is growing every day.  All right.  So, uh, all the Who's Your Daddy car sale ad.  Yeah, we can talk about that. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, my God.  They took the, the, the, the, the whole Boston phrase thing, and now there's a huge car sale  this weekend.  A car dealer.  Who's your daddy?  Where's the deal here?  It's the Who's Your Daddy sale.  You sure?  Where is it?  In Harlem?  Who would think a car dealership would, uh.  You're making a comeback.  I like that.  Oh, I, every once in a while, I'll just fire one in from my sickbed.  You decided to just be a sniper today.  Yeah.  You're just kind of hanging out on that roof, just sniping down with your, with your one  lighter.  You guys have flown very nicely.  Um, you know, Charles Whitman.  So there's no reason for me just to, to pipe in when you guys are both being very entertaining 
[02:30:00]  and funny.  Oh, thank you.  Outstanding.  Exactly.  Whatever.  There's a Who's Your Daddy car sale.  Who's Your Daddy car sale, because the car dealers are always so subtle.  I sure do, Ope.  Here you are.  No, go to page 162.  Of your workbook.  That's, that's called the workbook.  Turn to page 162 of your daily news.  There we are.  Who's Your Daddy.  Trying to capitalize on it.  Look at Big Ed.  Who's Your Daddy.  Wouldn't Ope and Anthony are on XM radio look great? 
[02:30:30]  That size in the paper?  That would be really nice.  But no, it's a Who's Your Daddy at Major World.  But it just doesn't make sense.  Who's Your Daddy, 50% off, original.  Yeah, it makes no sense.  It would be cool if it, if you could work it in a way that it would make sense as far  as selling cars.  Like, Who's Your Daddy?  Bring Mom, and if she has a black eye, you're getting money.  All right, well.  I would like to see, but I will tell you, they are promoting you guys, because I went  into a Best Buy.  Yeah.  And I'm like, do you guys have XM radios? 
[02:31:00]  And they said, yes, we do.  And they pointed to them.  I'm like, are Ope and Anthony on there?  And they're like, they're on the high voltage channel.  Hee-bity-hoo-bity.  To me, that's the key with that channel name, is you should have no name recognition with  the channel.  Yes.  We're changing that.  I want to see it done.  When are we doing that?  When?  Everything takes a really, really long time.  I want it done immediately.  Oh, do we have to have the pre-meeting meetings?  This is more than a 48-hour thing.  These things take forever. 
[02:31:30]  Washington is, they just walk around the halls down there, just going from meeting to meeting  to meeting to meeting.  There's so many meetings that they can't get anything accomplished from some of these meetings.  There's more conference rooms than offices.  It's unbelievable down in Washington.  We're trying to get a grasp on that whole entity down there.  We don't really get how it works.  It's a beautiful facility, and they got this huge master computer that's kind of like from,  you know, it's kind of like Hal, actually.  Yes.  Huge.  I think the computer runs the people down there. 
[02:32:00]  It's the Whopper.  And yeah, we want to change the name of the channel, and there's a lot of people in agreement  down there, but it's going to take a while.  Why?  I don't know, but it's going to take a while.  Because things take a while.  Because High Voltage was a really stupid name for this channel.  The name Opie and Anthony is a very recognizable and famous name in the radio industry, and I  think that even people in non-O&A markets will hear the name Opie and Anthony on the channel  and purchase it to hear High Voltage.  Or at least have it Opie and Anthony's High Voltage.  I like it to be Opie and Anthony's virus or something like that. 
[02:32:30]  I like Opie and Anthony.  That's who you guys are.  It's your channel.  How about just O&A?  No.  No.  That's not as easy to recognize as Opie and Anthony.  All right.  Calm down.  No, no.  I'm all about recognition.  We've got to say hi to Garrison.  Hey.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Well, basically, I'm just calling.  I like your show because you guys don't really judge.  Because if you guys judged, you would definitely know fucking Norton's gay.  Hmm.  I'm not gay, sir.  How are you not gay?  Monster Rain?  Do you like transvestites? 
[02:33:00]  What's the difference?  No.  This is why you're behaving like a silly goose.  Monster Rain, I was very young.  And I don't like transvestites, sir.  I have respect for the transsexual community.  And I think you might want to pony up and have a little respect as well.  I don't like some guy that throws a dress on.  That's queer.  But if that young lady has big, beautiful bosoms and happens to have a cock,  who am I to not receive oral treats from her?  That is totally disgusting, though.  Sir, it's not disgusting. 
[02:33:30]  It's lovely, and it's all-inclusive.  Listen, Norton, come on.  Come out of the closet, all right?  Sir, I'm trying to educate you.  Education nothing, all right?  I wish I was gay.  Gay men are very lucky, but I happen to be a slave to women, unfortunately.  Oh, that's unfortunate.  So do you have Tourette's, Ben?  I mean, I see you on the Tough Crowd.  Yeah, Tough Crowd.  Do I have Tourette's?  And you can't even get the things right, you dyslexic asshole.  You mix up the 11 to 11.30 hour with the 11.30 to 12, soon to be canceled. 
[02:34:00]  Cocksuckers at Comedy Central Hour.  Send to me, you AIDS-infested macrophilis.  Cancel rectum patient, okay?  Was that your Dennis Miller-like rant, you dullard?  Hey, there's a little ferret's got the attention span of a knot with a coke habit.  Let's go to George.  Watch you slip and crack your teeth on a urinal.  I'm trying to be witty when you call the show.  Hey, wake up and smell the coffee.  That was next.  Norton's not sniping anymore.  Now he's got his AK-47.  Well, if someone's going to call up and insult me, what am I supposed to do? 
[02:34:30]  Hey, good part, sir.  I like transvestites.  I don't like transvestites.  Don't hate them either.  Welcome back to the show, Norton.  Thank you, sir.  I'm 15, I'm not feeling well.  Welcome to F back.  Jesus.  That's funny.  What's up, George?  Well, I'm surprised that Norton is sick, given his lifestyle.  The guy's a walking National Geographic special.  Yeah.  I happen to...  Hey, that's funny.  I'm not disagreeing with him.  That's a good one.  It's a very good one.  I just don't get sick at all. 
[02:35:00]  Speaking of which, we're going to get the review from the girl that Norton was with,  hopefully in the 9 o'clock hour here.  How great is that going to be?  Norton actually believing that a $1,000 hooker fell in love with him.  I don't think she fell in love with me, but I think she did like me.  My mule looked very good.  Oh, I forgot I'm gay.  So I was pretending she was Big Kev while I ate her vagina and ass and licked her nipples.  Norton, for $1,000, I'll stick my nose in your neck, and I'll give you the GFB experience.  Nuzzle.  Cuddle.  Nah, there's nothing...  I mean, if a guy wanted to eat my ass, you know, I probably wouldn't let him. 
[02:35:30]  You should never use the word probably.  I'm just not trying to make a point here.  All right.  Maybe that's not the right way to word that.  Probably.  There's a good chance.  There's really nothing wrong with that, but if someone's accusing you of being gay, maybe  you shouldn't use the word probably.  I'm just saying, if a tranny's giving you a head, you're only a queer if you reciprocate.  What I called about was that, who's your daddy at for the Yankee fans?  Yeah.  I mean, you gotta, you know, anytime you're talking to Yankee fans, you gotta get down to 
[02:36:00]  that lowest common denominator of about an IQ of 25.  So that's something they understand.  So are you a fan of the Metropolitans or the Red Sox?  You know what?  I hate them both.  I'm hoping a blib crashes into the stadium and kills everyone.  Well, who's your team?  I'm Mike Opie.  I'm a suffering, that fan.  So I said a Metropolitans.  He was on his own team.  Absolutely.  I did say a Metropolitans.  Yes, you did.  I'm out, guys.  Thanks.  I'm saying the knickerbockers.  It certainly is.  All right.  Very nice.  Okay. 
[02:36:30]  Speaking of gay, Governor McGrady was out on the town with McGrady.  Governor McGrady?  He probably is when it comes to cops.  Give me more.  Give me more.  Governor McGrady.  I thought that was a new McDonald's character.  I know.  The Hamburglar and Governor McGrady.  Also known as the Rump Wrangler.  That slip-up just gave you guys 20 minutes of material.  Jesus, what the hell am I thinking today?  Well, he was out on the town.  The New Jersey governor.  Greedily gobbling up that jizz.  The governor that's from south of here was out on the town last night. 
[02:37:00]  McGrady.  Governor McGrady.  Governor McGrady.  That's what Bob Grant used to call him.  Jim McGrady.  McGrady.  Governor McSelfish.  Oh, wow.  But you got to love the New York Papers.  They know how to spin everything.  Oh, I know.  They had him out at a play, I guess, Avenue Q.  He went to catch a Broadway show.  Broadway!  He, uh, he's just flown out of the closet. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, yeah.  This guy doesn't even try anymore.  Yeah.  Is he still married?  I don't know if that stoic-faced idiot who he was married to who just held his hand at  the press conference while he pretty much told everyone that she just couldn't get him  off his cock addiction.  Those useless ovaries on his arm as he, uh, walked out that day.  Untouched bosoms of hers.  Honey, how do I...  Forget it.  She had to call her girlfriend.  How do you think this looks?  Because old Fruit Cup doesn't know.  That might as well be sealed up canal chick that walked out with him.  Ugh. 
[02:38:00]  Well, he was out on the town last night.  Yeah, he was at the play Avenue Q.  And, uh, they had a picture of him with one of the puppets.  I guess there's puppets in the show.  Uh, yeah.  And, uh, he was...  They had a picture of him in the paper with a puppet kind of on his back talking to him.  And he had a big smile on his face.  And the puppet is a Republican character that is, uh, struggling with his sexuality.  And the puppet's name, Opie...  The puppet's name is Rod.  Rod.  So, uh, McGrady had a rod on his back as, uh, his picture was taken for the paper. 
[02:38:30]  Like, the papers don't do this on purpose.  He was awfully close to Rod.  They, they, they, the papers rag us about the content of our program.  They're doing the same thing.  They, they know what's funny.  They know what's a little, a little off.  You don't put the picture of the puppet named Rod on McGreevy's back.  Nope.  You shouldn't.  There he, they'll look at him.  You might want to put the puppet of Dr. Baring very bad news on his back. 
[02:39:00]  I'm sure that, that's a puppet that might be appropriate.  You know, the governor, he looks pretty loose in that picture, but Rod looks a little stiff.  Doesn't he?  He's back there.  Like, right after the picture was taken, Rod spit up some yogurt on the, on the good governor.  Well, I hope no one left him on the seat, then the governor sat on Rod.  And then stood up and realized he had to sit back down again.  Governor, you're sitting on Rod.  Over and over again.  Get up.  But be careful with that puppet.  You're rubbing Rod all over Jim's face. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, he just flew out of the closet now.  He doesn't care.  Yeah.  I guess, is he going to try to hold on to the job, or is he leaving like he said he was going to?  I don't know.  Too much scandal, I think.  Not even him being a poll smoker, but I think it's a matter of the fact that he, like, you know,  put the guy in the position for New Jersey Homeland Security, who was an Israeli poll, you know, that type of stuff.  All of the polls are up his ass.  He's done.  Is he?  Yeah, he's leaving.  Yeah, people are trying to throw him out early.  And the elections when?  Month? 
[02:40:00]  Not even?  Three weeks.  Three weeks.  When do we vote?  I've got to re-register now, because I moved.  A couple weeks.  Oh, you guys vote?  You know, I was going to be a good citizen and vote this time around, but I don't know who to vote for still.  And it has nothing to do, believe me, I know both of their agendas.  Nothing either one of them can say right now is going to change my opinion and go, oh, wow, I missed that one.  Of course you've got to vote for this guy.  Like, the polls are always swinging back and forth. 
[02:40:30]  They have another debate.  The third debate, they discussed nothing new.  Nothing.  And once again, the polls swing one way or the other.  Because some rube saw something that changed their mind.  Well, there actually was something interesting at the last debate when Kerry pointed at the rug and said, as you all know, Cheney's daughter will be munching this as soon as we walk out.  Jesus Christ, John.  I know.  I love how he was just bringing up Cheney's daughter being a lesbo for no reason whatsoever.  Not at all. 
[02:41:00]  I went into a Jewish deli with Dick's daughter.  She ordered the tongue.  He's finally fighting back.  He's getting dirty, finally.  Yeah.  Oh.  Jesus Christ.  Was that you, Jimmy?  Don't fart.  It was.  What do you care for, Kev?  You can't even enjoy it.  Yeah, but I'm over here.  So why wouldn't you want to watch Ben torture?  You can't help Ben.  You should be hiding the lights on.  I want to know why we said, was that Jimmy?  And Big Kev is nodding if you can't smell anything.  He heard a noise.  Oh, you heard it.  Oh, it made a noise?  It made a cute little noise. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, man.  Little button.  Typical gay man's fart.  Nice little one.  Very cute.  Yeah, so I have no idea.  I don't know who to vote for, but it's not because I don't know their agenda.  I think they're both a couple of tools.  I'm going to vote for the guy that's against us being on the radio.  Believe me, pushed into a corner, Kerry would throw us off, too.  You think radio all of a sudden is going to get better?  You think it's going to be regular radio, all of a sudden we're going to be able to 
[02:42:00]  go back to the type of radio we were doing on regular radio?  There's no way in hell.  Kerry won't lobby, and I hate to laugh, but the liberals don't lobby as heavily.  You can't come out in favor of porn.  I love porn.  What else a runaway is going to do?  I mean, you have to come out against it, but they don't lobby as hard against things like  indecency and the stuff that the religious right goes crazy.  I've always hated when these politicians come out against something that's irreversible,  because it's like, I remember out on Long Island many years ago, bottomless dancers, 
[02:42:30]  you know, topless and bottomless, fully nude, in the bar, you'd go in there and watch fully nude.  All of a sudden they made a law, for some reason I guess fully nude girls were freaking  people out and making them murder and rape and stuff, so they had them slap their panties  on.  Now, you find me one politician who's going to run on the platform, and I will get the  panties off of the dancers.  Clinton?  It doesn't, it just doesn't happen.  You would love to see it, but once they make those decisions, it's over. 
[02:43:00]  So I can't see us going back to the type of radio that we used to be able to get away  with and people enjoyed on regular radio.  No matter who's in there, Kerry's going to come in, yeah, let's get back to the tits and  ass on radio.  Believe me, his plate's going to be pretty full if he does, you know, million to one  shot win this thing.  So I don't know who to vote for.  Bush, I can't vote for this guy.  He's, he's, and I know the spin that the Democrats have put on it.  He's a liar.  He wasn't straight for the, you know, you could debate these things back and forth, but I 
[02:43:30]  don't think he was completely honest, and that kind of infuriates me.  You think that he's pretty much a faker?  I think he's a faker.  Liar, liar, pants on fire.  You know, and of course he brought up the excuse that he was working on the same intelligence  that everyone heard, and that's why he made this decision.  But you're the big guy.  You're the boss.  You have to take the responsibility and realize that a mistake was made on your watch.  There weren't any weapons.  And he went to war. 
[02:44:00]  The war was based on, regardless of what we're doing over there now, freeing a bunch of people  who apparently still want to blow us up, it's all fine and well.  Making that a democratic country in this hotbed of terrorism, that's fine and dandy.  That isn't what we were told when the war started.  The war was started to just go in there and get the weapons out.  There weren't no weapons.  Well, the intelligence was bad.  Your intelligence from your people.  And he will not fess up to that.  If he just came out, you ask the guy what mistakes he's made over the past years, he doesn't 
[02:44:30]  have an answer.  So I have a hard time voting for him.  You can vote for Kerry?  No.  He said, no, the horse is a...  Frank and Kerry.  Ma!  Fire!  The red light went on for the debate.  He went, ah!  Thought it was flames from torches coming out.  Guy was petrified.  Run for windmill!  Ah!  Yeah, that's funny.  Iraq war!  Brrrr!  Bush!  Brrrr! 
[02:45:00]  Cheney daughter lesbo!  Brrrr!  Awful.  All right.  That's the...  Oh, what?  That's my whole thing on the election, so I have no idea who to vote for.  Well, now I have to read 100 emails.  You guys are talking about politics a little too much.  Oh, yeah.  Boy, sorry if you mistook the show for Hannity.  Oh, yeah.  Sorry.  Okay.  We'll get to O'Reilly.  Don't worry about it.  You want to do it now?  All right.  We got to keep hanging up on people because we're trying to see... 
[02:45:30]  And by the way, Bush is after this show.  He's trying to shut down this program, Opie.  That's right.  Ah.  Yes.  Yes.  We got to get Bush out because he has a personal vendetta against this program.  Oh!  Yes.  Poo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Trying to bring me down.  That's right.  The FCC is on me.  It's all about me, Robin.  Ah.  Yeah.  And President Bush, I know he's got other things to worry about.  But, yeah, he's focusing on me.  Ah.  Oh!  Yes, that's right, Robin. 
[02:46:00]  Poo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Poo-hoo-hoo.  Baba Boo, will you get me a line to the president?  Ah.  I want to solve this thing.  Poo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Oh!  I think he's too busy doing other things there, Howard.  He's tracking me.  I saw a black helicopter following me while I was driving my Escalade out to the Hamptons.  Ah.  I think there was a bug in my sea breeze.  Oh!  Poo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  They're bugging me.  What a complete ass to think the president of the United States is after you.  What a dick.  I had to get rid of Jackie Martling.  He was a government agent, Robin. 
[02:46:30]  Ah.  Yes, he was spying on me.  Oh!  Yeah.  After me.  Ah.  Did you see the debate?  Uh.  Every time Bush was mouthing, uh, I'm gonna get you, Howard.  Oh!  You could tell.  That's what he was really talking about, right?  Uh, Jackie the G-Man Martling.  Ah.  Poo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, wow. 
[02:47:00]  Paranoid?  A little bit.  Paranoid much?  A little bit.  Just a tad.  A little bit.  Okay.  So, yeah, we gotta get into the latest on Bill O'Reilly.  I used the OnStar on my Escalade and, uh, the president was on it.  Oh!  Saying he's gonna shut me down.  I heard it.  Ah.  Used my navigation system to get out to the Hamptons.  Uh, the government infiltrated it and, uh, tried to guide me into the Great South Bay.  Ah.  To get rid of me, Robin.  Because I'm such a threat.  Ooh. 
[02:47:30]  I'm a threat to everybody.  There was a barrel with my name on it dug up in Queens.  Ah.  Ooh.  The mobs after me, too.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  I was abducted and aliens put, uh, anal probes in me, Robin.  Ah.  Yeah.  Let's get some news, as long as it's about me.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Ah, dial a scapegoat, Robin.  Ah.  Yeah, he's more important than Osama Bin Laden. 
[02:48:00]  Jesus.  They're hunting for me now.  Sure they are.  Osama Bin Stern.  Oh!  You might have to go hide in a cave somewhere.  Toss from my wife.  She's taking all my money.  Five hundred million, she gets, uh, two hundred fifty million.  Ah.  Ah.  But, but, but.  Where did Jim Norton go?  I'm right here, Alpy.  I've got Allison.  Allison.  She's the best friend I could ever have.  Ah! 
[02:48:30]  With friends like that, who needs enemies?  If I may reiterate, do you pay all your friends?  I mean, Jesus Christ.  Do you give all of your friends, uh, half a quarter of a billion dollars?  Oh, God.  Can you play the, the crashing cart thing?  That's-  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my, oh!  Oh!  W-A-N-B-C.  That's right.  That's right.  W-A-N-B-C. 
[02:49:00]  W-A-N-B-C.  W-A-N-B-C.  Fuck you.  That's right.  Oh, he really wants to say that so bad, but he doesn't have the balls to.  Because he only goes after the people that can't fight back after the president.  Oh, God.  That is hilarious.  All right.  Could you keep hanging up on people?  We're trying to see if this couple will help us out in Boston today.  I don't think so.  I bet not. 
[02:49:30]  We should have got their phone number, now that I'm thinking about it.  I hung up on them?  My problem?  My fault?  All right.  I'll take the blame.  Whatever that means.  Whatever that means.  Well, I love when people say that.  Ah, I take full responsibility.  And then the problem goes away.  Like, wait a minute.  You could screw up in the public eye, but all you have to do is go on TV and go,  I take full responsibility.  And Bush should do that.  What the freak does that mean?  It means your head should go on the chopping block.  But that's all you have to say.  I accept full responsibility for what I did. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah.  And then you as the viewer go, oh, okay.  All right.  Well, he took responsibility.  He took responsibility.  So I guess we're not mad at him anymore.  It does get you out of trouble.  All right.  Okay.  We brought in our Bill O'Reilly interview where he just tried to kill us with this whole  sex thing.  Yeah.  According to that lawsuit that was filed against him, this makes him quite the hypocrite.  Well, the big headline today is that he's been told to just keep his mouth shut.  You know what? 
[02:50:30]  I'm sure his lawyer's told him to keep his mouth shut.  It seems, too, he's been asked a couple of times if any of this is true.  And no one's heard him deny this in that way.  You know?  He kind of uses these terms that might save him legally.  So I don't know.  Like I said yesterday, I don't doubt he did any of this stuff.  I really don't doubt he did this.  I don't think it upset this woman as much as she's making out that it upset her.  And I think she found a good opportunity.  Something may have happened between the two of them. 
[02:51:00]  And she wanted $60 million out of them.  I'm still thinking they got a tape of it.  I think so, too.  I think they got the phone calls taped.  That would be gold.  Gold.  Could you imagine we're on this program, Opie?  You hit a button, and we have the tape of Bill O'Reilly just going off on the phone  with a vibrator buzzing up his ass.  We'd be able to.  We would be the only ones that would be able to play that.  Yeah. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  We would be the only ones who could play that in its entirety.  I can't wait.  Please.  I hope there's tapes.  All right.  No spin zone.  All right.  Let's, you know, do that, and then we'll do this.  So you do that.  Yeah.  That means push the button.  Yeah.  You need a driver there, buddy.  Who's this?  This is Jake calling about the job.  Driving.  I saw it in the paper.  Yes.  Yeah.  Well, you still need a driver or what?  Did you fill an application with us, Jake?  Pardon me?  Huh?  Speak up there.  What did you say? 
[02:52:00]  You fill an application with us?  No, no, no, no.  Look, I saw it here in the paper, and I'm calling you, fruitcake.  I'm looking for a job driving a truck.  We're looking for movers.  Yeah.  Well, that's what I do.  What class driver's license do you have?  I got five, one, two, three, four.  I got them all.  Yeah, class one?  Yeah.  I drive buses, trucks.  I'll back a truck through the fucking two-family house garage.  One of those big two-ton trucks.  When was the last time you drove a truck to trailer?  Oh, jeez.  What the fuck? 
[02:52:30]  I'd say about two weeks ago, I robbed one down in Jersey, and I drove it up here to New York.  Fucking flying.  Drove it through the tolls, no stopping, no nothing.  I'm good.  All right.  I see.  Why don't you call back on Monday?  Hey.  I'll tell you what.  I come in, I'll take you for a test spin.  How's that?  We go out and we take the truck around the fucking block.  I speed, I pop wheelies.  I'm good, baby.  Go back on Monday, I'll talk.  All right.  Can I get you?  I want you.  You sound good.  You and me.  We make a team.  You drive with me. 
[02:53:00]  All right?  What's your name again?  Jake.  Jake, who did you work for, Jake?  Oh, jeez.  I worked for Moish.  I worked for Mayflower.  You know?  Oh, yeah.  Don't sh-  Hey, I was good with them, too.  You worked with Moish's?  Yeah, that's right.  When?  Eh, about, what, two years ago?  See, what I got a problem there, they get fucking scared when I pop the wheelies and  all that shit.  You know, I pop a lot of wheelies.  I'm good with that shit.  You know, I don't break no merchandise.  See, I get it there two hours ahead of time, all the time.  What do you say? 
[02:53:30]  Say, if you pop any wheelies there, I'm not even gonna put in your...  Uh, listen to me.  I don't break nothing, sizzle chest.  I'm good.  Okay, call Monday, we'll set up an interview.  Okay?  All right, I'll do that there, Rubberneck.  I'll call you Monday.  Okay.  All right, fruitcake.  See you later.  Thank you.

[02:55:30]  Tell you that.  Can I quote LBJ?  What?  Nam Jam.  I will not sing.  24-7, 60s on 6.  Radio to the power of X.  XM Satellite Radio.  Evil.  I'm loving it.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I almost broke my vagina.  Drink until she's pretty.  It's a freak show. 
[02:56:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, it's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We wanted to do the O'Reilly thing, Anthony.  What?  Sorry.  What happened?  I'm looking at the latest Anna Kornikova pictures.  Yeah.  Part of a bikini on top of her boyfriend. 
[02:56:30]  Sex bagel rules.  He really does.  He had a little, uh...  He slipped a little this week, but he's back on track.  And what he does every morning is he trolls the internet and gives us the latest celebrity  photos for us to check out and get ready for the show with.  And now he's got some Anna Kornikova pictures for us.  Thank you.  She's a dirty girl.  Look at her laying on top of her boyfriend with her legs spread.  Oh, and...  Yeah, look, Anna Kornikova.  Thanks.  Uh, be careful, Jim, because we got your girlfriend on the line.  Well, I want to...  We don't want to upset her. 
[02:57:00]  We don't want to upset your girlfriend.  We know how much she's attracted to you, and you might break her little heart.  I don't see the attraction to this tennis player at all.  You don't like her?  No.  You don't like this?  You're convinced that your girlfriend likes you.  She certainly does.  I don't like this Kornikovia.  Kornikovia.  She's, uh, overrated.  Really?  I like brunettes.  All right, we'll do the O'Reilly thing in a second.  We brought in our interview when O'Reilly tried to slice and dice us.  Yeah.  Because he was obsessed with sex when he was...  It's all about the sex, isn't it?  When he was interviewing us, it was all about the sex, so we'll get into that in a few minutes. 
[02:57:30]  But, uh, the other day, for all the people that just turned on their XM radios...  By the way, I think they rerun all the shows from this week during the weekend, so you could  do a lot of catching up if you just got your radio turned on.  Get caught up.  Right.  Uh, we had a fine, fine, um, couple of girls come in from a certain agency called nyconfidential.com.  Escort.  Uh, yeah, they do the girlfriend experiences.  Yes.  And, uh...  Dinner companions.  They were great.  Lovely.  And it turned out that nyconfidential.com gave us all a free hour. 
[02:58:00]  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, no surprise, Norton was the first one.  First one.  He did it, I think, three hours after the show.  Two hours after the show, I believe.  Yeah.  He had to get some food in his belly, and then he, uh, went and got his free hour, right?  I certainly did.  And we got your review, I think, yesterday, was it?  Or two days ago now?  I don't even know.  It was yesterday.  I gave a glowing review.  You sure did.  And, uh, your fine girlfriend is on the phone right now, Natalia. 
[02:58:30]  Hey, Natalia.  Hi there.  How are you?  Hi, Natalia.  Very good.  I'm so sad.  I missed the review.  I can't believe it.  It was a very good review of our experience and of the whole thing.  Top notch.  Top notch.  He said...  I'll have to listen on the weekend and hear it, but...  He said you were unbelievable.  Absolutely unbelievable.  Actually, his quote was, uh, the best escort experience.  He's ever had.  That's, you know, that's the goal, right? 
[02:59:00]  And he's had quite a few.  And here's a guy, I think, I think he's low-balling, but he'll admit on the air that he spends 20  to 30,000 a year on, uh, this type of thing.  So he's, uh, he's had quite a, uh, a number of, uh, of, uh, of, uh, dates.  Yes, and this, this was the best one I've ever had.  And he's done the whole Vegas thing.  Wow, thank you so much.  He's been to some of the ranches and this and that, but he says you, Natalia, you're the best  one he's ever had.  Oh my gosh, that's crazy.  Because it was the kissing and the hand-holding, it was nice. 
[02:59:30]  It wasn't just, you know, uh, some people you feel like you're just doing a business  thing with, but this didn't feel like that.  So, what was your first thought when, um, uh, Jim got naked?  What was the first thought?  Oh, no, shut up!  I'm laughing at you, so shut up!  Oh, my God!  I'm a disgusting fat body, brother Kyle!  Oh, that's terrible!  Well, Natalia, we could all be honest here, Jim's a little mushy when he takes his shirt  off.  Oh, a little mushy.  I'm being polite. 
[03:00:00]  Jim is an unbelievably attractive man, I have to say this.  Oh!  Thank you!  Oh, hey!  I'm sure none of you will ever have the pleasure, but it's really once you, like, spend time with  them one-on-one and all the kind of stuff that it really comes out.  Is this on Bizarro Planet or here on Earth?  I don't know, I've been told that maybe I'm from another planet, so hey, maybe you can.  Jim's toying with himself now, he's got both hands in his pockets.  I'm just standing here listening to Natalia, and she's great.  Where's the studio again?  Maybe I should come over.  Oh. 
[03:00:30]  We'd love you to come back.  All right, so what was your thought when he kind of, you know, started disrobing?  Well, it was a whole, like, flurry of fabric type thing, and then we were just kind of  there.  It's not really, I don't know.  We had a blonde, we had a freaking blonde, and I have to say that.  I don't know.  It was really, really, really, really, really good.  Wow.  Thank you.  His style and technique, what would you give it?  That's my articulate review.  It was really, really good.  I know.  Natalia, I've got to call you out on this just a little bit.  I mean, are you paid to say that, though? 
[03:01:00]  I mean, was this better than other experiences, and why?  Absolutely.  And why?  A two-part question.  Yeah.  But why was, like, the experience with Jim Norton better than others?  Because I'm convinced you're going to say, you know, it's great no matter who you're  with.  Um, it's not great no matter who you're with.  All right.  But why, what was special about?  Because, um, well, obviously, you know, he's, he's, I, I, obviously, I'm not, you know, 
[03:01:30]  listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen,  just as I thought.  This is why, this is why I, you know, I'm on this end and I'm not writing reviews.  I'm really not that.  No, you're, you're fine.  You actually did a good job in the studio.  You're, you're, you're doing fine on the, uh, on the telephone.  No, but it's just, um, I don't know.  Hmm.  You can't tell us why Jim is a little, a little, a little, a little better than most, huh?  I mean, look, I'll, I'll admit.  I hope, I hope I'm not being, you know, I was there with you.  It was all good.  I, I had a fucking awesome time. 
[03:02:00]  I might just put that on there.  I, whatever, I just, um, I just woke up.  No, it's okay.  I got, I got a couple more questions.  Okay, ask me more questions, please.  Were you a little, um, were you a little, uh, surprised when Jimmy decided to, to, uh,  to, uh, I want to try to keep it clean, Anthony, believe it or not.  Good luck.  Even though you're on XM Satellite Radio.  Because I don't want to get, when Jimmy decided he had to check out the, uh, the, the,  the Stumpier.  The balloon nut.  Yeah.  Jimmy said that he, uh, he, he said he went around to the rear. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  Only, only kissing wise though.  I, I didn't say we, we, uh, did anything more like that.  Yeah, yeah.  He likes, he likes tonguing the rear.  Way to, way to, way to clean it up.  Yeah, right on.  Were you a little surprised when he, uh, pulled that move on you?  Look, man, I ain't falling for no banana in my tailpipe.  Huh?  That's becoming, that's becoming more and more popular these days.  No.  Especially in the last couple weeks.  I'm like, what is it?  It really is all the rave, isn't it?  It's, uh, it's, it's sweeping across America. 
[03:03:00]  Sweeping America.  Coming in at number five, it's eating ass.  Ass munching.  Working its way up the charts.  It's eating ass.  Now number three.  I wonder why that's becoming so popular.  And now at number one this week, it's eating ass.  I wonder why that's, uh, taking over there.  Very popular.  Very popular.  Okay.  I don't know.  Maybe it's autumn.  Maybe it's the season.  You know?  So, so when Jim, uh, just stare at it.  Eat it.  Yeah.  That's right.  So, um. 
[03:03:30]  Help me, Leo.  No, you're doing fine.  I just, uh, I think one more question.  I don't want to be saved from you guys.  I know.  Uh, was Norton packing?  Yes.  Yeah, that's.  Oh.  Most of, uh, his friends have seen his mule.  And, uh, yes, he's definitely packing.  Really?  Um.  Bigger than usual?  Like, where would you put him on the scale?  He would have an enormous schwanstucker.  Hmm.  Norton, this could help you.  Trust me.  I'm helping you out here.  Yeah, I know.  Every Pickle Park cruiser and, and what they call sleeper leaper guy and. 
[03:04:00]  No, strawberry cowboys.  Have you seen my wiener?  Oh.  Uh, where, where does it fall?  Okay.  Where does it.  Where does it fall?  I don't know.  Um, yeah.  A way above average?  A way, way above average.  Way above average.  No, but in addition to that, in addition to that, I know this is like a really super cliche  thing that people say.  It's not, it's how you, you know, it's what you do.  But really, in this case, he's got like double, double exclamation points on both looks  and performance. 
[03:04:30]  Oh, he's packing and he knows how to use it.  Thank you.  He had a lot of confidence.  Wow, you knew what you were doing, Jimmy.  Very good.  I was very happy.  Have we covered all the questions, Anthony?  Wow.  Well, she was very diplomatic.  She was very satisfied with the experience.  And then, uh, he was very happy that you did the cuddling thing.  Who doesn't like cuddling?  What the hell?  No, no, he was...  Yeah, that's good stuff.  No, I don't understand.  I don't understand when people don't...  I mean, I understand some people are more affectionate than others.  I don't understand girls who just don't. 
[03:05:00]  Jim's more infectionate.  I may make up a word.  No, he was very happy at that.  Usually when he's picking up the girls in Newark, they, for some reason, don't like cuddling  in the car.  No.  They want to cuddle money and a crack pipe.  Would you like to cuddle?  Hey, Daddy, I'll cuddle with you.  Now it's time for the cuddling.  Jesus.  You haven't been, uh, having a scratchy throat, uh, today, have you?  Or a scratchy butt. 
[03:05:30]  I'm getting a very sore throat.  You are?  No, I don't.  No, I'm fine.  She's perfectly healthy.  No, we know.  We don't want to...  We know that, so we don't want to, uh...  Her immune system's probably worked up like the Incredible Hulk.  Little cells in her.  Kicking ass.  Little green cells.  I was like having a deal with guys like Jimmy all the time.  Her immune system is like steel.  Here's our immune system.  Ooh!  Ah!  Bad germ kill!  Yeah.  Wow, she sounds like she had a good time. 
[03:06:00]  She was great.  And here's the final question, Natalia.  Just so you know, I am naked right now.  Oh, no.  Hey!  Just throw that in.  Wow, hey.  All right.  Hey, look at that.  Okay.  Um, were you...  Was there an attraction to Jimmy?  Jimmy feels like there might be something going on between you two.  No, no.  There's definitely an attraction.  He's an awesome, amazing person.  And when he looks at you, you feel him looking at you.  He's right there with you.  Yeah, that's what other witnesses have said on the stand, too. 
[03:06:30]  When he's looking at you, it's like he's just looking at you.  Ah!  Having to face him.  So, let's be honest with each other.  There was no real love connection, though.  I don't think it was love, but I did enjoy Natalia very much, and she was a great person,  and I think we had fun.  It's so hot.  She says she's naked, and she's talking to Jim about the experience.  The truth of the matter is she's probably working right now.  No!  No?  Wow, you're naked?  Yeah. 
[03:07:00]  Hi, can I get something over here, please?  Some guy in the background all pissed off.  Some guy yelling, this is my hour!  Who's this Jimmy guy?  Are you cheating on me?  Pay attention!  All right.  Well, thank you, Natalia.  I had a very nice time with you.  Yeah, you're definitely a good sport, Natalia.  Thank Jason for me, too.  I didn't do that.  There she goes.  I really didn't do that.  Well, it sounded... 
[03:07:30]  Could you call her back and tell her she had a good time?  Because I don't think they get the XM at the house.  Yeah, just let her know that it wasn't an intentional hang-up.  Yeah, because we want more free hours for Jimmy.  New York checking in.  Will the escort services ad from now on carry a best escort experience ever?  Jim Norton of the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, right.  A little endorsement.  Ooh.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Okay, here we go. 
[03:08:00]  Tony from Boston.  O'Reilly has a book, The O'Reilly Factor for Kids, A Survival Guide for America's Families.  He writes about sex and booze for kids.  Scary effing thought.  Yeah, his whole pitch in that book is how you should shield your children from all the sickos  that are out there and all the sick media that's on the computer and television and those darned  rap videos that are just full of boobies and booty, Opie.  And shock jocks.  And he's the guy.  Shock jocks.  He's the guy. 
[03:08:30]  And shock jocks, of course, that's going to save the world and save the children.  Didn't he cost Ludacris a Pepsi endorsement?  Yes, he did.  Yes, he did.  You know, there was a little story back in August 2002.  Jenna Jameson was on The O'Reilly Factor.  On his show.  And talking about pornography.  The porn business.  And, of course, he's just ripping her apart.  Not in the way she's normally ripped apart with a big, huge cock.  But in the O'Reilly way.  And after the interview, he requested copies of her films. 
[03:09:00]  I told you guys that yesterday.  Oh, really?  I wasn't listening.  Oh, yeah.  No, I didn't.  Yeah, requested copies of the films.  After the interview.  Not like he needs them for research before he interviews.  Most of these guys are just full of ass, man.  Remember that guy who was that?  I've sinned against you, my lord.  Jimmy Swaggart.  Swaggart.  But I'm talking about the biggest perverts ever.  I'm talking about the reporters and these media guys.  We had a New York Times reporter in here.  He acted like he loved the show and really got what Ant and I are about and this and that. 
[03:09:30]  We were going to get killed in the New York Times.  Do you think?  I understand that.  He seemed like a nice enough guy.  I disagree.  People in Washington called me yesterday afternoon because they had then interviewed them.  And they're like, why would you hire these guys?  You know what they did.  We don't get, you know.  What?  Oh, yeah, dude.  He totally changed his tune after he left the studio.  Are you kidding?  Not kidding at all.  Let's see how it looks.  It looked like it would be a great ad, right?  I'm a great ad.  A great interview? 
[03:10:00]  No way.  Let's see how it looks.  It looked like it was destroyed in the New York Times a week from Sunday.  Well, if that happens.  Which is fine.  I mean, if the New York Times is writing good stuff about Opie and Anthony, then we're not  doing our jobs.  That's what I'm convinced of.  And then we've had other experiences.  Remember the time in Boston when we had all the illegal girls getting naked in the...  I mean...  Teen girls?  Illegal girls.  Yeah, it was smart.  Just a joke, people.  No, this local reporter for Fox up in Boston comes in to do a story on Anthony and I when 
[03:10:30]  we were doing our whole Whip Him Out Wednesday thing when it became so huge up there that we  were told to stop it.  Yeah, they were doing a story on it.  And they sent some reporter over in a t-shirt and jeans.  He had an earring.  Remember he had the earring?  And he's like, comes over, guys, I'm such a fan of the show.  Dude, this is going to be so cool.  Right.  And he videotaped everything.  And that day he came in.  Oh, my God.  One of the sickest days we've had.  Yeah, and there were naked girls giving them lap dances and stuff when the cameras were  off. 
[03:11:00]  Lots of nudity.  The girls were going at each other.  Right.  And he was filming some of the stuff and filming us and doing an interview with us as our friend,  you know?  Guys, it's going to be great, man.  Great exposure for you guys.  So we're all psyched and we're all naive.  We sit down to watch the newscast.  All of a sudden, the cool guy in the t-shirt with the earring, he didn't have the earring  anymore and he was dressed in a suit and his hair was all slicked back and he was standing  there on an overpass of the Mass Pike with his microphone going, whip them out Wednesday. 
[03:11:30]  This is a promotion done by two shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  A danger on the highway?  Should this stuff be permitted?  And just started railing us.  It wasn't the same guy.  Showing pictures of, showing the video of the activities of the day.  Yeah.  And just, we were the antichrist.  We were the worst.  And all these guys do it.  We're learning as we move forward here, you know?  We were really stupid back then. 
[03:12:00]  And even when we did Bill O'Reilly two years ago, we were pretty stupid.  Remember, he meets us and he was really, really cool to us.  And, you know, congratulations, guys, on all your success and this and that, blah, blah,  blah.  And then proceeds to try to, you know, destroy us on camera.  Well, then you have to address that once it happens and you have to address it relentlessly  if it happens that way.  I think you're wrong.  I don't think it's going to be that bad.  What, the New York Times article?  Absolutely not.  If it is.  It's fine if it is.  We'll discuss it.  But, you know, I wish the guy was a little, well, we'll see. 
[03:12:30]  Anytime.  I guess we'll see when it comes out.  See how it is.  I'm tending to believe Opie now.  I'm kind of siding with you now, especially if he's doing an interview with the rest of XM.  They're asking all the questions.  The questions.  That we've heard a million times.  I mean, he has to ask those questions.  They may be very standard questions.  What made you think that these guys won't self-destruct again?  Maybe they were questions that, you know.  We'll see.  Maybe.  Who knows?  So, Chris from Boston, as we seg into this Bill O'Reilly thing here.  Again.  Bill O'Reilly.  Hey, guys.  How much of a pompous ass can this guy be? 
[03:13:00]  He told a reporter last night, famous people are targets and I'm a big target.  Yeah.  Wow.  Also has a big cock.  That's what the guy writes.  He goes, I didn't know if he was talking about his celebrity status or his hog.  He must love that part of it.  Really.  Yeah.  You know, you get all these accusations and stuff and then it says, big cock.  Well, yeah.  He's like, everything is false about this report.  Everything's false.  Except for one thing.  Except for big cock.  I want to stand behind my big cock. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  Get rid of one of them.  Thanks, Ben.  Not too distracting.  So, we got our Bill O'Reilly interview.  The latest is that he's been told not to talk about.  Not to talk.  That's what the lawyers tell you to do.  What is it?  He's pompous even in the paper.  I've been told to keep my big mouth shut.  Keep my big mouth shut.  A little self-deprecating humor there.  Keep my big mouth shut.  Should have kept your big mouth shut on those telephone calls there, Bill.  Allegedly.  And maybe keep your bunghole shut, too.  Keep that big bunghole shut and keep the vibrator out of it. 
[03:14:00]  According to reports.  Yeah.  According to many, many reports.  As reported in the lawsuit.  As reported on.  Yeah.  As allegedly reported.  As everyone believes.  Very allegedly.  You like to talk dirty.  We really don't know.  We weren't there.  Not at all.  But we're just taking a guess that you like to talk dirty.  We weren't there.  We don't know.  This is allegedly.  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  You decide.  Yeah.  It's the no spin zone.  Fox News.  You read and then you decide.  Yeah.  And there was some good reading yesterday on this program. 
[03:14:30]  Use that vibrator.  All right.  So this is actually pretty entertaining.  We never played this on the radio.  No.  Our exclusive interview with Fox.  Stupid Bill.  Talked to him for well over an hour and this is the piece they put together.  You know, it's not that bad.  But the funniest.  When he goes off on the sex thing, it's like.  It's the sex thing.  Now you look at him like.  What a hypocrite.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony.  These radio geniuses were fired from a multi-million dollar gig last week after they aired a play-by-play 
[03:15:00]  of two people having sex in, of all places, St. Patrick's Cathedral.  These two radio geniuses.  Hey, at least every girl that's ever come on our show that has done things on the air  has been willing participants.  Not like as reported in the lawsuit against you, Bill O'Reilly, where you're making these  phone calls and it's against this girl's will. 
[03:15:30]  That was Shepard Smith.  You know that.  That was the Shep?  Yeah, Shepard Smith setting up the bit.  Oh, that was Shepard Smith, the guy that was arrested for running a woman over in a parking  lot once?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Anthony, you mean you've never called a subordinate and masturbated with a thing in your ass?  Well, Dan, but.  But you've never called a girl while you're talking about your, yeah, my wife has a vibrator  and then put one in your tuchus.  And talk as I crank it and ejaculate.  You ever did that?  I don't remember.  No, I don't think so. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah, that was the Shepard Smith.  Yeah, he's just setting up the bit.  But so far, one false account there.  Yeah, it wasn't a play-by-play and whatever.  This may be the first time you've heard of them, but not Bill O'Reilly.  Oh, no.  Factor this.  He's been onto these guys for some time and actually sat down with them a few months back.  Donna Summer once sang a song about hearing it on the radio.  But 25 years ago, Donna Summer had no idea that radio in America would come down to the 
[03:16:30]  likes of Opie and Anthony.  These two shock jocks have made big money by dreaming up sexual situations and then convincing  low-life listeners to act them out.  All right, I've got to agree with him there.  Well, yeah, that's true.  All right.  Seems like he's dreaming up some sexual fantasies and having an ex or current or former of whatever  you want to call them, employees acting them out on a phone.  Yeah, low-life listeners or your own producer.  How about that?  Hell, when I got my cell phone, I had no idea the things you could do with it, Bill. 
[03:17:00]  So, we've got something in common here.  I've got a vibrating cell phone in my ass.  Call Bill O'Reilly.  You're learning about radio and I'm learning about what I could do with a cell phone.  Thanks, Bill.  Call me now, please.  Be dialing, people.  I need a little vibe on my rectum.  As I spank one out to an unwilling participant on the telephone, according to the reports.  Allegedly.  Lawsuit, allegedly.  We have no idea because we weren't there type of thing, yes.  But I believe it personally.  But O&A finally blew it.  No pun intended.  It's like you blew a load on your stomach during those phone calls, Bill. 
[03:17:30]  And let it dry there?  Well, we don't know.  But I started talking about your appearance on the Leno show to the girl that was disgusted  on the other end of the line.  Who blew what?  Huh?  What?  Oh, I got a little on my phone.  Hello, Moto.  Gotta clean that up.  So, who are Opie and Anthony?  Well, we were onto them way before everybody else.  Yeah.  O-A-A!  O-A-A!  O-A-A!  O-A-A!  Those are the low-life listeners.  Whip them out!  Whip them out! 
[03:18:00]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes, it's Whip them out Wednesday.  If there's a wow on your vehicle, they see the wow, pull up next to you, and slash you  their beautiful breasts.  This is what used to happen when Opie, otherwise known as Greg Hughes, and Anthony Cumia were still  on the air.  Otherwise known as Complete Tool.  Right up.  Well, why did you just say that?  Otherwise known as, see, we know his name.  This is Bill O'Reilly, otherwise known as Fucking Pervert. 
[03:18:30]  Allegedly, according to reports.  What a pompous dick.  This guy, just listen to his delivery on the whole thing.  Listen to how fake disgusted he is with us.  He's a pompous ass.  Take your bra off and take it off now.  Hey, what color panties are you wearing?  Well, those two clothes.  All right.  Didn't make us look good in that piece, huh?  No, but, you know, I was doing the Vince McMahon impression.  And I was doing my Bill O'Reilly impression.  And you were doing it.  Yeah.  I think you were doing the wacky DJ impression. 
[03:19:00]  I guess that audio of us talking intelligently about politics just didn't make for a good  story that day, right?  Sex was the staple of the program, especially sex that involved public display, women flashing  their chests, people having sex on the air.  Tastelessness, the pair thought would appeal to male listeners during drive time, was also  welcome.  Hughes and Cumia have always pushed the envelope.  They were fired from their previous radio job in Boston. 
[03:19:30]  In a 1998 April Fool's Day prank, they claimed Mayor Tom Menino had been killed in a car crash.  Two weeks ago, it was this couple's sexual escapade at St. Patrick's Cathedral, they say it  was simulated, that was broadcast live on the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, there he goes.  They say it was simulated.  I'm sorry.  I don't think anybody's loud.  Bill's saying this didn't happen.  Yes.  They say.  They say.  He's basically saying there, oh, I know what happened, even though I wasn't there and didn't 
[03:20:00]  hear the program.  They say, yeah, okay, whatever.  I say I never called this woman with a vibrator in my ass.  I say.  She says I was jacking off with her on the other end of the phone.  We have no idea what happened during those phone calls.  Who knows?  According to her lawsuit, I like putting fake penises in my ass and jacking it on the phone.  Bill says that he didn't have a dildo in his ass. 
[03:20:30]  Right.  Yeah.  You decide.  It's a no spin zone.  The couple were arrested, along with the producer who provided the play-by-play of the encounter  over his cell phone.  A firestorm ensued, the FCC started an investigation, and Infinity Broadcasting gave Hughes and Cumia  the boot.  Boot.  A possibility the pair weren't thinking about when they sat down with me.  That is such bull, because we discussed all that on his show.  Remember, we said, look, we got the type of jobs, you know, that where we were so edgy, 
[03:21:00]  we have no idea when it's all going to end.  We told them all this stuff.  When they sat down with me, and I sat on a vibrate.  You know what's funny?  He tried to make this look like we gave an exclusive interview.  What you're about to hear happened at least a year before we got fired.  It was a year before we got fired.  That's what these people in the media do.  They find whatever tape they can and put it together to meet their needs and make believe  they got the exclusive interview.  We never talked to him about, you know, after Sex for Sam.  And they called like crazy. 
[03:21:30]  Women.  Love them.  All right.  Here it comes.  See, I know.  Here it comes.  All right, Bill.  He looks at us.  Women.  Love them.  Yeah.  And then I'm sitting there like, all right, here he goes.  I do, too.  I love calling him up with a vibrator in my ass and jacking one out as I talk dirty,  according to lawsuit reports.  Sex objects or, you know, what?  Shores. 
[03:22:00]  In a way.  In a way.  In a way, that's part of the way men look at women as sex objects.  You walk down the street.  You see a girl, especially a nice summer day, wearing a little top and shorts.  You're going to look.  All of a sudden, that place is her.  You don't know her from a hole in the wall.  You're not thinking about her IQ scores.  Yeah.  You're just thinking about what her phone number is.  Good one.  Good comparison, though.  You don't know her from a hole in the wall.  Very nice and accurate.  I like that little digital noise that's going on. 
[03:22:30]  Did we do the interview from the Millennium Falcon?  I don't know.  This is the best.  Sounds like we're broadcasting from space.  This is the best copy we could find.  Yeah.  We're back to Wave Files.  Yes, Steve?  Yeah, it was really hissy audio.  I had to run it through several noise filters to get it to that sterling quality.  Thank you.  Have a hissy fit.  One of the articles I read, you had an interesting phrase.  Cringe radio.  Right.  It's like cringe telephone.  It's cringe radio.  We like to make people cringe.  We like to do things where people go, I don't know if I should turn off or listen, 
[03:23:00]  but you know they're listening.  It's painful to listen to sometimes where you're sitting there going, oh, my God, is  it going to go further?  Are they going to stop right now?  Oh, my God.  Is Bill going to go further or is he going to stop right now?  Please, Bill, stop.  I just messed this up.  Yeah.  You're doing good.  Okay.  Thank you.  I got the family, friends, and dildo up my ass plan on my phone.  I call it my dildo up the ass plan.  Of course, we like pushing buttons.  We like getting reactions.  How crude does the audience want it? 
[03:23:30]  There's a lot of different levels.  I don't think you can just pigeonhole our listeners into, you know, this guy wants it  this crude, you know?  There are some people that get turned off by it and switch the radio off.  There are other people that are like, why didn't you go further, you know?  And we know at this point what our audience likes.  We know how to do it.  That's what we give them.  Well, what do they like?  What do they want?  They like to be entertained in traffic.  Be specific.  Be specific, though.  You just said.  Wait, wait, wait.  You just said. 
[03:24:00]  We know what our audience likes and we give it to them.  I want specifically what they like.  Okay.  You know what men like, Bill?  No.  Yeah, you don't know what men like.  You know what men like, Bill?  They like calling up women on the phone and jacking to it.  That's what they like, Bill.  Don't you know?  Can you sprint?  Can you hear my vibrator now?  Good.  I was looking at him going, you're just like us.  Who are you kidding?  I know.  Who are you kidding?  You're a guy just like Anthony and I. 
[03:24:30]  He's a guy.  He's got some success.  So he's got some fame.  He's got money.  You know what he's doing?  Stop it.  He's calling women.  Allegedly.  We have no idea.  I tend to believe it.  Personally, based on what I have read and my meetings with Bill O'Reilly, I would believe this story.  I believe this woman.  I believe that he was doing these things.  Calling up this woman with a dildo in his ass.  Are they saying that's where that was? 
[03:25:00]  Or was he using it just to kind of...  Where else would it be?  I'm saying where it is.  Maybe he was using it to just vibrate his area.  He says, according to the lawsuit, that she...  What?  According to the lawsuit she filed, Opie.  Why is Ben hackling on this?  He said he owns a dildo that's shaped like a cock with a battery in it.  That's his vibrator.  So you don't hold another cock vibrator against yours and use it like that.  You would stick it up your keister.  Unbelievable.  I think you could use it a few different ways, though, I'm thinking. 
[03:25:30]  I don't know.  He's a sick puppy.  It's funny.  Yeah.  And you know the other thing about O'Reilly?  From what I've heard from people that work over at Fox, you can't even touch his chair.  You can't even go near his stuff.  He's the biggest dick.  Who the hell wanted to touch his chair?  I know.  We read yesterday.  He's got batteries on it.  It vibrates.  Whoa.  The chair.  Excellent.  We give it to him.  I want specifically what they like.  Here it is again.  Listen to me.  You know what men like, Bill?  No.  Talk about sex.  Talk about sports.  Talk about entertainment. 
[03:26:00]  Hanging with their friends.  Talk about TV shows.  Talk about sex.  We got to get that clip for our little machine.  Let's talk about sex, baby.  Let's talk about you and me with a dildo in my ass.  That's a great sound.  Talk about sex.  Talk about sex.  Talk about sex.  Talk about sex.  Talk about sex.  Where's my phone?  Talk about sex.  Talk about sex.  Sex.  Sex.  Sex.  Sex.  Sex.  Sex.  Sex.  Sex is number one.  There's sex in there, sure.  We wouldn't consider sex number one on our show. 
[03:26:30]  No way.  No way.  Every time I turn in.  The media likes to pigeonhole it that way.  Well, wait a minute.  Every time I turn into your program, there's a babe taking off her top, or there's a discussion  of lesbians.  Listen every day, Bill.  You see?  It looks like he listened to us.  I guess so.  We might have influenced him.  I think he might be right.  He might be right.  But these shock jocks have got to get off the air, because it's making responsible journalists  do crazy, crazy things, and they're not doing their show. 
[03:27:00]  If we can influence a conservative like Bill O'Reilly to do things like call up women with  a dildo in your ass and jacket on the phone as you talk dirty to her, just imagine what  the poor, impressionable children are going to do now, based on this program.  Now, I'm stopping this show.  It is a danger.  Bill O'Reilly has proven that to me.  You see what I mean?  Yeah.  Every time I tune in, there's a sexual theme.  I'm not hearing the ball scores.  Every time you call someone, it seems like there's a sexual theme. 
[03:27:30]  The ball scores are two of them in your hand as you jack it with a vibrator in your ass.  You think he ever pulled over a car and went, spit your gum out?  Show me how you produce the show.  What a pompous ass.  He probably listened to the show.  It gets him so worked up.  There are some people out there that cannot listen to sexual content, cannot watch sexual  movies.  They get so charged up that they got to do something. 
[03:28:00]  And it can't just involve spanking one out or maybe some kind of normal sexual relation,  especially maybe if you're married, you have a problem, intimacy with the wife after a  while.  Who knows?  But some people can't handle it.  And it seems like maybe he's one of those people that has to go out and do things like  phone sex with women.  Amazing.  It's like Jimmy, maybe, a sex addict.  You can hear the frustration in his voice.  Very frustrated.  He's got to sit there and be all straight-laced. 
[03:28:30]  He's pissed off.  And he wants to call up and talk about getting two stewardesses in a car in JFK parking lot.  You know?  He's pissed off that we get to live in this environment and he has to do his stupid talking  points.  Talking points.  And try to get rap stars in trouble.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  If you took sex out of the Opie and Anthony show, you had a lot of dead air, you know  what I mean?  No, we don't.  We fill it up.  Is there anything you won't do for ratings?  Because it's all about money.  That's what it comes down to. 
[03:29:00]  You want to get good ratings.  You want to succeed.  You want to make money.  You want to stay on the air.  That's what it's all about.  Yeah, that's exactly why we got into this business.  Maybe you, Bill.  Did we fall into the money after 10 years?  Sure.  Of course.  We made no money doing this for many, many years.  Yeah.  The last thing this was about was money.  And he's like, you know, it's the money.  The money.  Well, who said that?  He pulled that out of his ass.  Well, he had to make some room for a dildo.  But, you know, where did that come from, Bill? 
[03:29:30]  Yeah, where did that come from?  Is there anything you won't do on the radio for money?  For money.  Because you're mercenaries.  That's clever.  Aren't you mercenaries?  Am I wrong?  No, we go out and we want to do a good show every day.  Yeah.  For the reason of not money.  You know what?  We're artists, too.  And we like creating and we like entertaining.  You're artists.  You like what we do.  And when we come off of a great show that we feel we did a great show that day, we're feeling good about it.  And as far as doing anything for ratings, no. 
[03:30:00]  You know, that's another misconception.  We're not going out there trying to do this sensational stuff to get ratings.  The people you work for, the big operation, the big radio operation, do they care what you say on the air?  Oh, without a doubt.  We have to do every day.  We have guidelines.  We have FCC, you know, rules we got to adhere to.  And we do a very good job at that.  Well, you skirt it.  You skirt it.  You're smart.  Yes, you skirt it.  We're very smart.  We know where the line is and we tiptoe on the line, of course.  They just don't want us to lose the license of the radio station.  Simple as that. 
[03:30:30]  As long as you're adhering to FCC regulations and making money for the company.  They don't want to get fined.  Yeah.  That's bad for business.  Some of the rules are very clean cut and plain and simple.  And some are a little gray.  And the job, our job to entertain in the type of radio we're doing is to carefully tread that line.  Well, it looks like Opie and Anthony didn't tread carefully enough.  But even worse, Aunt Bea will never forgive them. 
[03:31:00]  Bill made a funny dick.  Hey, Bill, do me a favor when you're jacking it.  Do me a favor and listen to this.  None on us.  None on us.  None on us.  Responsibility?  None on us.  None on us.  There's certain guidelines you have to adhere to.  Yeah, like not calling your subordinates with a dildo in your ass.  That's a good starting point.  That's a good jump off point of things not to do. 
[03:31:30]  Bill O'Reilly, defendant Bill O'Reilly, as it's stated in the report.  In the report.  Which I've read about five times already and just laugh my ass off.  That's great.  When he starts talking about how she should have a vibrator and how he's the guy that can take care of her until she finds a boyfriend,  that he can give her lessons and train her.  He can train her to be a wonderful lover. 
[03:32:00]  And what kind of a girl did you hate that bit on the side?  I know.  Isn't that the creepiest bit?  It's so creepy, man.  Me and my lover eat large portions of pork and make love.  O'Reilly's one of those creepy kind of guys, though.  He doesn't have a sexuality to him.  He's so straight-laced on his image that you can't picture him getting down and dirty.  So when it comes out, it's almost like that Frank Gifford story that came out years ago about him tooling some chick in the ass in a hotel room. 
[03:32:30]  Oh, my God.  It makes it that much creepier.  This is what he said on Regis and Kelly, or is it Kathie Lee, whatever.  Whatever the blonde is.  Regis and current whore.  Kelly.  Regis and current.  Kelly Rippa.  Current blonde.  Rippa a new ass.  During an appearance to promote his children's book on Live with Regis and Kelly, O'Reilly said he'd been repeatedly threatened with lawsuits and bodily harm over the past few years.  He said he knew that by filing his lawsuit, he could perhaps ruin his career. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah, filing your lawsuit.  No, he's trying to save his career.  That's a preemptive strike.  He's so trying to just save it at this point.  Pete from Jersey, what's going on?  Oh, and hey.  How's the guys going, huh?  Hey.  Hey, I just wanted to tell you something about Bill O'Reilly.  He was talking to you guys about it's all about the money.  You guys don't charge people to view your website, and he does.  He charges a premium membership that's 15 cents a day.  We only charge people to listen to us.  That's right.  And that's because we had no choice.  Bad example, my friend, but I see where you were trying to go there. 
[03:33:30]  We went this route because we had no choice.  But we still try to give as much free stuff to our listeners as possible.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, thanks, buddy.  Pete from Connecticut.  Hey.  Hey, guys.  First time in a long time.  All right.  Quack, quack.  You know what Bill O'Reilly was doing, don't you?  Huh?  He was doing the no-spin jerk.  The no-spin jerk.  When no one's home, you make a phone call to your producer, and you start to jerk. 
[03:34:00]  Get out the lube.  But you got to have the dildo in your ass, don't you, Bill?  For that no one home, chick on the phone, dildo in the ass jerk.  Great.  You got to love when things like this happen.  To a guy like him.  You know what pleasure people took when we got thrown off the air? 
[03:34:30]  Oh, yeah.  You know the reporters, and they were all giggling and having a good time, and Shepard Smith was calling us idiots and buffoons.  And they giggle and love this.  And I got to admit, it is fun.  When it happens to someone else, it's a pisser.  It's actually a fun party to have.  Yeah.  When people are on top and they fall on their ass, God, it's so much fun.  Joe from Jersey.  Glad I could pile on.  How are we doing?  All right, Joe. 
[03:35:00]  Hey, I'm an ex-cop, and just the way this guy was interviewing you guys, I don't remember.  Was that when you were on N.E.W., or was that just recent?  Your name Volpe?  No, that interview was done about a year before we actually got fired.  Well, maybe not a year.  I'm trying to remember.  I don't know.  That interview was 1977, I believe.  It was at least, well, now I'm thinking about the one-armed bandit and all that, and the slot machine shit.  I wouldn't be surprised if the FBI profilers were looking at this asshole.  There's nothing wrong with this guy. 
[03:35:30]  I remember sitting there in front of him, and when he was asking all that stuff, I was just getting a creepy feeling from the guy.  Yeah.  Really just creepy.  I would have made him stand up.  I bet you he had fucking wood.  I mean, he sounds like he was getting off on this interview.  This guy, he's a freak.  All right.  Thank you, Joe.  All right, have a good one, guys.  Freak.  Freak.  Freak.  That was right when you guys got syndicated.  That's when that piece.  Was it?  Yeah.  The original, yeah.  Oh, okay, the original.  So that was about a year before we got canned.  Doesn't Bill O'Reilly have a small child, like four years old? 
[03:36:00]  Nice role model.  Yeah, no, he just had a baby recently.  Yeah, nice role model.  How would you like it, Bill?  How would you like it if your daughter grows up, gets a career, becomes a producer somewhere,  and then goes to a concert and allegedly has a little too much fun at the concert,  and then ends up in the emergency room while you're trying to have this big, huge career?  Wow, I wasn't even going there.  Yeah, and your wife shows up at the hospital, or your ex-wife very upset. 
[03:36:30]  What are you talking?  I was going somewhere else.  Oh, you're talking?  Bill O'Reilly.  Oh, oh, I'm sorry.  Bill O'Reilly page.  I was on the wrong page.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, I saw that.  Oh, oh, what?  No.  Go to the O page, not the S page.  Oh, I'm sorry.  There you go.  I'm sorry.  There it is.  All right.  I got mixed up there.  I'm sorry.  Your daughter grows up, gets a job, goes in there, and her boss is calling her up on 
[03:37:00]  the phone, dildo in ass, and talking dirty to her against her will.  Would you enjoy that?  Would you enjoy that, Bill?  I don't think you would.  Even though, according to these reports, you're kind of a sick bastard.  You're supposed to be protecting the children.  You're one of those guys on TV.  Protecting the children.  Yeah, you're a protect the children kind of guy.  There's a lot of you out there, the protecting the children guy.  Boy, he must love the fact that all this is coming about when he's trying to promote 
[03:37:30]  his kids' book.  Oh, that's great.  And if you can't protect the kids, you shoot some on your stomach while you chat on the  phone.  Creep.  Yeah, gotta love it, man.  Gotta love when these things happen to these people.  At least us, we're a couple of screw-ups.  You know what I mean?  If we get thrown off the air because a couple's having sex in a church, you know, we're ass  wives, and it's expected of us.  We're not trying to be anything else than who we are. 
[03:38:00]  When you're a Bill O'Reilly and people like him, and you're trying your best to get on  the air and put out this persona that you're holier than now.  You're saving the world.  You're getting people fired from their jobs.  You're getting people thrown off the air because all in the name of protecting our society and  the children.  Because you know better.  And then behind the scenes, as reported in lawsuits, you're doing awful things.  Awful perverse things. 
[03:38:30]  You're a hypocrite.  That's how I see it.  Hypocrite.  Okay.  Why don't we, uh, why don't we go and take a break?  And we'll play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show next.  Aw.  You know, honey, I knew it was hot and sunny before I even got out of bed today.  Ask me why.  Say it.  Say why.  Repeat after me.  Why?  Because my balls were hanging low. 
[03:39:00]  Let's say that real tight.  We're talking rainstorm.  Half-masked, cloudy with a chance of showers.  That's right, honey.  The penis sinks for itself.  It's got its own brain.  Why do you think the head's bigger than the rest?  I can prove it's got a mind of its own.  You ever get up in the morning and he's already awake?  He's dressed.  He's ready to go, right?  He's in the kitchen making fucking flapjacks.  You're in bed going, come on, Joey, five more minutes. 
[03:39:30]  Your penis is going, take me shopping.  I need a new hat.  But you remember when they first came out with the hard-on, huh?  Third, fourth grade, you're leaning over like the hunchback of Notre Dame.  Teacher calls you up to the board and you're like, I don't think so, honey.  You're the teacher, you figure it out, all right?  I got some kind of ligament over here.  I don't know what's going on.  This thing is like alien.  It's drilling into the desk next to me.  Call a cop. 
[03:40:00]  Maybe he'll throw a donut around.  But you grow up.  You learn to accept the hard-on to deal with it.  Accept the pee hard-on, you know?  That's God's joke.  You get up, you're late for work, you got to take a squirt and Joey's admiring the chandelier.  You got to stand here like a moron and talk him down.  Come on, Joey, I dig you.  We'll dot I's and cross T's later.  Work with me. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah, the morning hard-on.  I'll put that up against that Ginsu knife any day.  It'll slice, it'll dice, it'll pump your car up if you got a flat tire.  See what I'm saying, Calum?  Heather.  Your boss knows where you are.  I'm Kevin Eby with Chip Talk.  If you have a job that takes you out of the office, new technology allows your boss to follow you wherever you go.  The product is called GPS Time Track, and it's made possible by the new technology in cell phones that was originally designed to improve 911 service. 
[03:41:00]  That new technology pinpoints your location for 911 operators so they can send help quicker.  But a company named Zora figured out how to use that same technology to help bosses figure out if their employees are where they say they are.  The product works with Nextel phones, and it can even set off alarms if employees go somewhere they shouldn't, like ballparks or taverns.  The company's CEO jokes that violators are not electronically shocked, at least not yet. 
[03:41:30]  Zora says more than 1,000 companies are using its product already, and it claims they've saved more than $100 million by giving them evidence against false overtime claims and other charges.

[03:42:00]  Do you have an Audi belly button?  Do you ever eat an entire chocolate cake?  Hey, thanks for checking us out today.  We appreciate it.  A couple things.  Don't forget, I believe if Washington has their S together, all the shows you heard this week will be rerunning on this channel all weekend long.  So if you know of people that are just turning on their XM satellite radios, there's a lot of great stuff they could check out and catch up on. 
[03:42:30]  It's not going to be the first show we ever did run five times, is it?  Well, I don't know.  You know, and the George Carlin bits are still playing.  Oh, my God.  There's no reason for more phone calls.  Just fix it, please.  Please.  Please.  And don't, if you have to rerun an older show because of something with the master computer down there, just give us the most current show.  I don't want to hear the first week of shows.  They were okay, but we're doing much better now. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah, we're.  The show is getting more gooder every day, so why are we going backwards in the process?  We're getting up to speed every day.  All right.  All right.  Let's go to Chad in Minnesota.  Very pissed off.  Yes, Chad.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Chad.  I'm a new guy.  I've never even called a radio show before.  Oh, there you go.  First time.  It was my first experience.  No, a couple of things I just wanted to mention.  I called once before, and I'm another truck driver.  But in any case, you know, the whole thing about Howard Stern, I wanted to mention that guy stopped listening to him because, you know, 
[03:43:30]  I was like, listen to Grandpa talk about having sex with Grandma.  The guy's an old guy.  It was like it was time to move on, in with the new, out with the old, so to speak.  And that whole bit about O'Reilly, that whole nonsense about doing it for the money.  Listen, man, I was in it for like eight years.  I wasn't getting anywhere financially, but it was a hell of a lot of fun, and that was why I did it.  So I took on a whole new line of work.  So here I am, man, driving a truck.  What do you think of that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Am I getting a bunch of weird noises with my bit? 
[03:44:00]  Minnesota, huh?  So this is the first time you ever called a radio show, huh?  Yeah.  Is it obvious?  Am I sucking?  Am I blowing or what?  No.  I would have thought that you've called at least a hundred times.  Hey, man, I could have given you a joke like you hear about the two nuts in New York and one was assaulted.  Yeah.  Okay.  I get a lot of laughs off of that one.  Okay, man, you know what?  I'm killing the air time, so you guys have a good day.  We'll talk to you later.  He knew. 
[03:44:30]  He knew to punch out, Maverick.  Yeah, he punched out.  Wow.  He punched out a little late, though.  I think he got singed.  All right.  So we got that going on on the channel.  They'll replay all the shows.  Also, Anthony, I don't know what it's going to look like tonight, but we're going to be on VH1's best week ever.  Oh, right.  That's tonight?  I forgot we even taped that.  We were asleep when it was happening.  Jesus, really?  Hopefully they'll be able to make something out of the mess we gave them.  That was after yesterday's show.  We went down there and did that before the big party that I pooped out of. 
[03:45:00]  Yeah, so I guess we'll be on VH1 tonight at 11?  Is that what it's going to be?  Is it at 11?  And then they rerun it about 100 times over the weekend like everything else on MTV and VH1.  Yeah.  What did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today?  Mormon from D.C. writes, I learned Little Jimmy is a farting sniper.  George from Philly, I learned that an escort's ass is Cuba and Little Jimmy's tongue is Florida.  He also learned Little Jimmy's body is like a National Geographic special. 
[03:45:30]  And the only way Al Sharpton will get on the White House grounds is holding a lantern.  Thank you, Rich Voss, for stopping on by today.  Lewis, I've learned that Bill O'Reilly has the friends, family, and dildo up the ass plan.  Allegedly.  Toolbag from Nolens.  It's so funny because your interview was shot earlier for the O'Reilly factor and then replayed on The Pulse after Sex for Sam.  Now it's your turn to replay the interview and expose O'Reilly.  O&A always win in the end.  There you go. 
[03:46:00]  Thank you, Toolbag.  Good example.  Muttbone from North Carolina.  And I learned today Asians have the best poker faces.  Yes, we did learn that.  San Francisco, check it in.  It's Tad.  Today on the show I learned Opie's cousin is Moby.  We're going to have to get him in here soon.  Buffalo.  Hey, Jay.  What's up?  Oh, my God.  The phone's definitely let us down.  They started off strong today and then just, the phone's killed us today.  The phone participation on this show today stunk. 
[03:46:30]  Awful today.  Yes, yes, Jay.  Jay?  No, this is Chad.  They must have got the name wrong.  Chad?  But you kind of knew that we were talking to you now, didn't you?  Yeah, yeah.  But, you know, how many people from Buffalo are calling in?  No, I got to know, what do I learn from yesterday's recap or replay?  I learned that my picture of little Jimmy Norton that I hoped to get signed at your appearance  when he wasn't there is probably floating in the Erie Canal.  Yeah.  What?  I had that picture.  Oh, you had the picture?  What picture do you have?  It's the one that.  When I went to the Buffalo appearance, I had a little picture of Norton that I had with 
[03:47:00]  him from Bonnaroo and I wanted to get it signed, but he wasn't there.  So you guys said you would have him autographed at Mel Pack, and I just, after yesterday's  show, learned that it's probably floating in the Erie Canal somewhere.  Absolutely.  Definitely not.  It is in the mail as we speak.  Oh, Jay?  Nice, nice.  Jay?  Chad, but yeah.  Chad.  Whatever.  Tommy from Brooklyn.  Hey.  Hey.  What's up?  I wanted to give out an FU if it's possible.  Yeah, I want to put out an FU.  We still don't have the FU line.  We're two weeks into the brand new Opie and Anthony show, and we want the FU line so you 
[03:47:30]  guys over the weekend can record your FUs, and then we can play it on the show.  Right.  Absolutely.  Where are we with that, Ben?  Or Steve?  The FU line is actually functioning, only it goes directly to Eric in the studio at  the moment, so we're working on that.  That means it's not functioning.  That's great.  Is that going to take 48 hours to fix, or can we fix that maybe later today?  Well, considering I told Jaime about it yesterday, this would be 24 hours.  I would assume 24 hours. 
[03:48:00]  No, Jaime's the man.  Yeah.  Jaime's the man.  Don't you diss Jaime.  I have a lot of confidence in the Jaime.  Jaime.  And so does Bill O'Reilly.  No, that's the Jaime.  I know.  All right.  So we're going to fix that?  All right.  So what was your FU, Tommy?  Oh, FU to XM.  When you take your breaks, there's no need for me to know where Branston is.  There's no need to hear Colin.  I can't stand the other guy.  All right.  My FU to that guy, Jeff, who called just before me from Buffalo.  Boring the crap out of me. 
[03:48:30]  Okay.  Very good.  Thank you.  Yeah, he doesn't like some of the bits that are being played during our breaks.  And they still got to fix the levels, I guess, huh?  The levels, the Carlin.  Yeah, a few things have to be fixed.  Hopefully, people will work very diligently over the weekend and repair these problems.  It just amazes me how long it takes to fix these problems.  It really, really does.  I know there's 130 channels on this service, but come on, man.  Do the repair requests have to go up to the satellite and then back down?  The workers have to go up and back down? 
[03:49:00]  I think to fix the master computer, we've got to wait for the next space shuttle launch.  Oh, right.  So they can go up there and fix all these problems.  Right.  That must be it.  I do believe.  You know, big FU to that Boston couple, definitely.  Yeah.  Boston, you let us down.  Kind of like how your socks are letting you down.  Oh, boy.  We had to go there, didn't you?  Here we go, tonight.  Thanks.  Thanks, O'Pan.  Yeah, but I mean, we're done anyways.  I've already settled on the fact that the socks suck and it's time, you know.  No, no.  Have faith so your disappointment is even more so. 
[03:49:30]  We are fucked.  We're done.  Please.  I want you to believe so you can really be disappointed.  All I believe is in Tom Brady on Sunday.  It's all about the past.  He stinks, too.  It's all about the past.  He stinks.  Yeah, you've got a good quarterback on Dallas.  Tom Brady.  You're cowboys.  I know I get excited to talk about football.  Thank God the second you go, yeah, to baseball now, they just go right to the friggin' pass.  Right to the pass.  World champion.  Super Bowl champion.  They really are a great team.  Too bad none of them can pitch.  Your team stinks and they're going down four straight. 
[03:50:00]  Dude, your cowboys are awful.  Let's talk about Vinny Testaverde.  Yeah, he stinks.  I agree with you.  You're going to pitch for Boston.  At least his little faggoty ankle won't give out.  Oh, yeah.  You actually needed me.  My leg hurts.  Shilling is a stud.  He's a fairy.  He's not a stud.  He's a stud.  Don't go down in the first game of the playoffs.  They tough it out, young Ben.  He set the whole mood for these playoffs.  Yeah.  Set the whole mood.  Just a big downer.  Big downer.  His ankle sheath is flopping up like a window shade. 
[03:50:30]  Oh.  When they really need him.  That shitty town hasn't had a win since World War I and they were relying on, of course,  a blonde-haired white man.  And what happened?  He let you down, dummies.  Oh, yeah.  Kurt's going to get us in at last year, man.  That's all I was hearing before.  Kurt's chilling, man.  It's going to be chilling, you guys.  You Yankees chilling.  That's right.  And he set the whole mood of these playoffs.  You know why he didn't do well?  Because he has hair like sex bagel.  Nobody wants to look at sex bagel hair on the mound. 
[03:51:00]  Perfect and blonde with a little spike, unshaven.  Maybe he was supposed to get his stupid foot fixed, but he slept through the alarm.  I mean, that's why it's flopping up like a window shade.  Well, the smoke alarm thing went off and I didn't get enough sleep.  So the Boston couple, they were supposed to come in and do it live on our show today.  And for some reason, they decided not to.  So Tennessee so far has given us the best sex action so far.  Tennessee.  Tennessee has the best sex in the country.  Maybe we'll get another couple on Monday from another part of this fine country to try to beat out Tennessee. 
[03:51:30]  Represent your state, people.  Polk Smott from Dorchester.  I learned today ass munching is climbing the charts.  Answer it.  Dave from PA.  I learned that Norton has a sore throat and a pimple on his bag, but it's nothing to worry about.  South Philly.  Checking in.  Today I learned that Newark escorts will only cuddle with a crack pipe.  Also from South Philly.  Today I learned that Norton's escorts have the immune system of the Incredible Hulk. 
[03:52:00]  Gabe from the Dump in Staten Island.  I learned that little Jimmy doesn't love and doesn't hate transvestites.  All right.  God, is this coming to a slow halt, huh?  No, it's not.  We're just a bunch of guys locker room talk.  Bell boy.  Locker room.  What's going on?  I learned that I'm going to quit my job and become a scuba dive boat captain.  Yeah, that seems to be a good gig down there.  You really should.  They're getting a lot of action down there.  Later, boys.  All right.  Bye, sir.  Erica from Long Island. 
[03:52:30]  What's up?  Long Island, Rhode Island.  All right.  That's not Eric either.  Erica.  Tiny little state.  Actually, I live half in Rhode Island, half in Massachusetts.  You know the only one that cares that you're from Rhode Island is you?  How do you live half in Mass and half in Rhode Island?  Well, because I have two houses.  Oh, look at you.  You overachiever.  What the hell show is that?  Is that the tone?  Oh, Regis and Kelly?  No.  It's like a Michael Jackson party. 
[03:53:00]  A bunch of little kids jumping around on the television.  No, it was a Michael Jackson party.  The mother would be in a cage being kidnapped, and a bunch of little kids would have tear-stained  faces.  Mommy, the king of pop put things in my bottom.  Allegedly.  They would show Michael writing a huge check to the parents.  That's why he wears that glove, because he doesn't want to get ink all over his little,  what is it called?  Livivigo fingers?  Vitiligo.  Livivigo is the treatment in clockwork art.  Livivigo. 
[03:53:30]  Punishment element, perhaps.  Not as good as Voss, thinking that the name of the slave ship was Amadeus.  Amadeus.  No, we did not.  In the break.  Yeah, Amistad.  He's like, Amadeus, isn't that the name of the slave ship?  Amadeus.  Yeah, Amadeus.  If I would have known why that dummy was asking, I would have said, yeah.  It was so stupid, we couldn't even identify it as being stupid.  Because he would have fired that reference out at the roast in a couple hours.  Oh, man.  Put it over on the Amadeus. 
[03:54:00]  On the Amadeus.  Oh, you should have let him say it.  I didn't know what he was asking for.  Okay, all right.  Man.  Dimwit.  And I thought the governor of New Jersey was named McGreedy.  McGreedy.  Erica, what's up?  Well, I offered you guys a lesbian couch, and I never got a phone call back.  Are you going to bring it down from Rhode Island?  Yeah, we're going to start ship it down.  Oh, you'll ship it down?  Ship it.  All right, stay on hold.  We still need a lesbian couch in the studio.  Where are we going to put it?  You got a minute, though.  So?  Okay.  They just cut us off anyway.  Who cares?  Well, we're going to put the lesbian couch in.  Michigan, what's going on?  What did you learn today? 
[03:54:30]  Hey, I'm really enjoying your show.  I think you ought to send Bill O'Reilly a gift.  I think you ought to send him a Makita drill.  Ah, the drill, though.  We should send him a bunch of drill-dos.  Imagine him.  Ah!  Bill O'Reilly here.  Don't stop calling me a whore.  Yeah.  I'm listening to you on my XM.  I've been listening to you since day one, since you've been on XM.  I'm spreading the virus here in the Midwest for you guys. 
[03:55:00]  Thank you, Mark.  George is saying he learned that eating ass has a 12-hour incubation period.  Mario, real fast.  Hey, I learned Bill O'Reilly thinks I'm a lowlife, and Anthony doesn't remember using a vibrator  on the phone with a subordinate.  Yeah, I don't remember.  You know, Anthony, three rights make a left.  Three rights definitely make a left.  A box of wine.  And the dog was already sick.  Yeah, we know, Steve.  Thank you.  Stop signaling with those thick legs of these fingers. 
[03:55:30]  Is he ordering that drink?  Like something really great is going to be said in the last five seconds of the show.  Relax.  We understand.  I think that's, I need another olive in this.  Put on another shirt with stupid iodine symbols on it.  Skull and crossbones, folks.  Well, I could give you a big ending, but I can't because of what we're doing here.  No, no, stop with the rhyme. 
[03:56:00]  Stop with that already.  People are driving.  Thank you. </pre>
