<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The May 27th, 2008 Opie and Anthony Show opened with self-deprecating humor, the hosts referring to themselves as "retarded" and offensive.  They immediately moved on to the aftermath of Gallagher's disastrous studio visit, detailing the ketchup and cake carnage.  The hosts then recounted a recent trip to Western New York, sharing amusing anecdotes, including a free meal at a Vietnamese restaurant.  A significant portion of the broadcast focused on Anthony's new relationship with Jill Nicolini. He detailed their weekend, including a dinner at FH Riley's (marked by reported excessive PDA and potential groping), Long Island bar hopping, and a christening where Jill was godmother.  Numerous listener reports about their behavior fueled humorous embellishment and exaggeration, leading to a running gag involving censoring Jill's image on a studio TV screen with a makeshift "Jill Guard."  News items covered included Hillary Clinton's post-RFK event comments, John McCain's health, and several news anchor gaffes, some potentially advocating violence against political candidates.  The show featured a guest appearance by Robert Iler (from *The Sopranos*), whose name the hosts mispronounced.  Humorous audio mixtapes, presented as both tributes and comedic commentary, were played for Anthony and Troy.  Technical difficulties with phone lines were mentioned throughout.

The show also included a lengthy, obsessive voicemail from Troy professing his love for Melissa, sparking crude commentary and dark jokes about their relationship.  This was followed by an audio clip of Troy singing for Melissa and further discussion of the unhealthy dynamic. The hosts shared their own awkward high school romance stories.  John McCain's health, as detailed in a recent news article, was discussed with joking speculation.  A listener recounted a hilariously unlucky experience with unpaid parking tickets.  The show promoted its upcoming animation festival and comedy tour, interspersed with listener calls and banter.  A news story about a father and daughter stuck on an amusement park ride provided further comedic material.  A phone interview with the author of a self-help book on reducing profanity was conducted.  The show featured frequent offensive language and humor.

Further segments included a discussion on anger control followed by a call from a grade school teacher dealing with cursing students, interrupted by crude jokes about Jim O'Connor. Listener gifts, including a nude woman collage ("decoupage") and blueberry muffins, were discussed, the collage becoming a recurring joke.  A caller described seeing Anthony speeding. Another caller congratulated Anthony on his relationship with Jill, prompting penis size discussion. A photographer was interviewed, sharing graphic anecdotes from his career, including covering the Virginia Tech shooting.  A discussion about a church banning an autistic child included vulgar jokes.  The "decoupage" remained a focal point, with continued vulgarity.

Rambling, often offensive, conversations characterized another segment.  Jokes about religious figures and disabilities, a listener question about an animated podcast, and a George Harrison hat anecdote were included.  A news story about an Arkansas wedding shooting was discussed.  The hosts played and discussed the song "There's Nothing Wrong With Buggering Boys" by a convicted pedophile, leading to further inappropriate jokes.  The LifeLock commercial featuring Todd Davis, ironically a victim of identity theft, sparked tangents about athlete's foot, a cross-dressing prom date, and a caller's experiences as a soldier in Iraq. A listener's criticism of the Iraq War led to a debate, with a caller sharing his perspective.  The hosts shared personal anecdotes and highly inappropriate descriptions of personal hygiene.  Planning for the animation festival and comedic performances, along with the selection of a "line of the day," concluded this segment.  "Decoupage" was repeatedly mentioned.

Finally, the show featured a nonsensical conversation about radishes, including a fictional radish-based religious ritual.  The possibility of having Frank Shamrock and Colin Quinn as guests was considered, then rejected.  Discussions about a TV show (possibly *Seinfeld*), a taxi driver, and the hosts' vacation were interspersed.  Dan's departure from the show was the focus of a final segment, featuring humorous banter and teasing. Dan expressed gratitude to the audience and co-workers, mentioning positive online feedback.  He plugged his website (thanandsam.com) and performed a short stand-up routine touching on racial humor and corporate life. The show ended with its outro music.

[00:03:00]  complaining all those two shock jocks oh really those meddling shock jocks shock jocks there's still  ketchup and cake all over the place by the way not all over the place i shouldn't say that i mean a  couple of places i got i got ketchup here on the edge of the console which is a little annoying because  it's where i kind of grab onto the console yeah it's sticky yeah i hate sticky but and then uh there's  also cake on the dump button so if i have to lunge over and dump out i'm gonna get cake on my finger 
[00:03:30]  i hope you slip because there's cake on the button and we get fired oh and i can blame it on cake you  can blame it on the greasy cake that uh they spent about uh three or four days steam cleaning this place  and we're still seeing remnants of gallagher's appearance yeah you can see the windows are kind  smeared like they tried to clean it but they're all streaked with ketchup yeah cake was everywhere  ketchup was everywhere and then is the star of the youtube gallagher video i see then how does that 
[00:04:00]  make you feel i'm sorry i was wiping down a counter yeah it's still wiping see they're still wiping and  cleaning yeah i've yet to see the finished product i can't wait you're the star of the gallagher video  it's up there on youtube wow you want to check it out do i come off as handsome well let's just put  it this way when you were in front of um the cake smashing yeah it was such a dud of a shot that uh  your your boy sam there young sam had to like put the the footage in reverse to make it go 
[00:04:30]  and then the cake appears again oh he didn't one of those youtube videos where it goes reverse and  forward five times because it's not that impressive if you just roll it yeah but it's uh gallagher  destroys the opian anthony studio it's up on youtube i'm sure it's up on onaradio.com as well  so i just want to say hi to uh uh everybody i met in rochester that's new york rochester i want to  say hi to everybody i met in buffalo new york of course we're uh heard on two fine radio stations in 
[00:05:00]  western new york well a third if you count well syracuse is in western new york but it's up there  but everyone that listens on the zone we're rock stars in rochester man they're loving this radio show  yeah want to say hi to everybody from the edge in buffalo i took a swing by the buffalo radio station  and and hung with shred and reagan and uh the bull for a while and then i um then i went to soda's  point i'm going real local with uh brother wheeze who's uh the king of rochester radio hung out at 
[00:05:30]  his cottage for a couple of days cottage well they call them cottages but uh you know they're they're  houses yeah they're beautiful houses on the water that would probably go for at least a million  dollars down here because we have a long summer up there summer is about seven weeks so you can you  could get yourself one of these really nice houses on the lake for nothing really because the rest of  the year just sits there because it's too cold so i spent time at um soda's point and then uh one of  my favorite restaurants of all time and i'm not going to say fh riley's although i just did well 
[00:06:00]  uh i have to say hi to mama son mama son you ever eat vietnamese food um hmm jimmy you ever eat  vietnamese food oh no why not i i think you would like vietnamese food i have a grudge  he's still holding you a grudge you don't think and i know you know vietnamese food i've heard is  pretty good it's like a thai food a little bit right yeah yeah it's all in that same family but 
[00:06:30]  yeah it's like you're kind of prejudice about it i'm not thinking yeah vietnam what is it gonna be  like rats no it's just fresher i'm not a big fan of chinese food because it's a little too greasy  and uh not as fresh for me because they they're big on the peanut aren't they yeah they're big on the  peanut the vietnamese are big on the peanut you're right like the peanut sauce and peanut gravy  and a bit of spice yeah but uh mama son pretty much you know it sucks uh because we knows everybody 
[00:07:00]  in town and mama son at this point because i've been eating there off and on for the last 20 years  because i you know i lived in rochester and stuff and i go there to just give her some business mama  son love your restaurants on monroe avenue and give her some business went there for my birthday with  uh my lovely girl and uh at the end of the meal she refuses to take any money so then you're like  then you're leaving like a really big tip on the table that would cover the meal and then they're 
[00:07:30]  running out of the restaurant you know shoving the money back in in your pocket and stuff and then  you throw it on the on the um you know on the ground in the parking lot they're still picking it up  trying to give it to you what's the matter where you're too buku what's too buku what's too buku  from full metal jacket oh big too much oh oh oh oh oh and then um no boom boom  so then so then i finally give up and i'm like all right thank you for the free meal you know 
[00:08:00]  and then i want to go back because when i'm up there i want to get my mama son in now i feel guilty  because now i'm thinking if i go back in there she's gonna think i'm just going for for free food yeah  that's what sucks about these people that try to take care of you because then they're starting to  think oh now he's taking advantage of my my kindness so whatever just a dumb quick little  story but i i enjoyed my time in western new york the last three oh niagara falls really fast  to the fat dude that's um operating the elevator uh the maid in the mist what's up i forgot his name 
[00:08:30]  already i said i would say hi to him on the radio but uh uh we were going up the elevator and it was  just me and my girl and i go oh a nice private ride for us and the guy wouldn't acknowledge i even  talked but then uh fast forward five minutes later he's huffing and puffing upstairs with a pen  a piece of paper and a camera and he goes hey this might be a stupid question but but you look like  someone i might know  i go opie yeah yeah i go uh no that's not me 
[00:09:00]  go away no i i did the right i did the right thing so i want to say hi to the fat dude that  runs the elevator fat dude at the maid of the mist but anyway i'm babbling how was your weekend anthony  oh very nice yeah yeah it was uh out east uh out east on long island yeah uh-huh out east um for  the the pretty much the entire weekend um had a very nice time uh did go to fh on on friday

[00:10:30]  sucking a little face i don't even understand what you're saying you know i have a lot of family that  works at the joint right my sister's there my brother-in-law my brother almost like the mayor  of the joint even though he doesn't officially work there yeah and then of course brett owns the  place and uh i got all sorts of reports man did you my my sister holly got a report from the  the i think it was diane that waited on you yes diane was very nice am i allowed to speak openly  because i had you know yeah you could speak openly uh i heard what did you hear that you made it 
[00:11:00]  extremely uncomfortable for for diane to even come to the table to see if you guys were okay  really the word groping might have been used groping groping i thought it was a nice uh a nice dinner  of spinach dip and chips or she was trying to and it was also reported to me that you guys didn't care 
[00:11:30]  that there were many more patrons in the restaurant  well um i mean you want to talk about public display of affection little pda oh my god i went  with um with the jill yeah we went down to fh riley's on friday and had uh some dinner no spinach dip  and two to three bottles of wine and a couple of bottles of wine which uh i thank you opie 
[00:12:00]  because um i did call up opie and say is there good wine down there because you know we enjoy good  wine yeah and um opa's like yeah there is but but is there anything in particular that you want  and i thought that was very nice so uh we picked out a couple of bottles that we wanted and it was  there for us yeah we didn't have uh what you guys drink it was that so so uh bird yeah that's the  good stuff ripple yeah i didn't i didn't know we had the king and king and queen of long island 
[00:12:30]  coming by long island royalty long island white trash royalty yeah yeah um we and then we went on  our white trash uh tour yeah around long island uh some of the long island bars whoa whoa hold on a  minute i mean you can't yes i can't gloss over certain aspects of uh this is what this is what came  in for my brother i mean this was yesterday so a mere three days after your your big date  brother elmo writes me imagine my surprise oh no when i went to riley's on friday night and aunt and 
[00:13:00]  jill were there dreamily looking into each other's eyes if they were any closer to one another they  would have went right through each other's bodies and ended up on the other side it was like that line  from all i want to do is have some fun by cheryl crow where she says they were dangerously close to one  another imagine their conversation i imagine their conversation went something like i can't tell where  you and and i began that's that's him speculating isn't it and then he does a scenario that we've 
[00:13:30]  imagined uh on the show already as aunt pushed the meatball towards jill with his nose  and we both ate pasta and the waitstaff hummed the theme to love story i realized that maybe the  first time i ever saw aunt without a hat  yeah i think i was hatless the entire weekend and then he writes perhaps it fell off as he fell  head over heels jesus he poetic the end that's brother elmo many reports coming in from uh your 
[00:14:00]  weekend but anyway things might have gotten a little you know yeah heated there at fh riley's  i think it's just the nature of fh riley's i like to so intimate i like to think very nice little  secluded table but uh the rest of the weekend was spent um uh well at first we hit a couple of the  local uh dive bars did you really go to off broadway yeah we went to off broadway oh and um 
[00:14:30]  yeah that was funny that's pretty much the townie bar in green lawn right it's safe to say yeah yeah  yeah some uh some woman felt compelled uh when we walked in to say oh my god uh jill nicolini i love  you i watch you every morning and then just grabbed her breast some woman just decided that was how she  should greet her really yeah that's a nice how do you do yeah that's a fine how do you do how do you do 
[00:15:00]  wait is that allowed when we meet jill again i don't know is that acceptable i don't i don't think  it's an acceptable form of uh saying hello but uh this woman thought it was uh better to ask yeah  this woman thought it was completely acceptable by the way jimmy it's not acceptable because uh  things have drastically changed we're in the office and you know we've spent the last year year and a  half just all ogling jill nicolini and aunt turned around because she was doing the traffic and we're 
[00:15:30]  like oh yeah jill and we just kept looking down at our papers and look down and and aunt was trying  to rally the troops and we're like no man i go isn't she doing a great job with the traffic i'm  like not only is bit over she's not she's not even showing cleavage anymore because i'm sure aunt had  the talk over the weekend i didn't have any talk whatsoever you had the talk with her i swear to you  i didn't say word one her outfit was a bit conservative this morning sometimes she wears  conservative uh more conservative outfits than other days that's all and then there was a 
[00:16:00]  suggestion that maybe we should symbolic symbolically turn off jill tv live on our show today no that  can't say look at the sign over there says jill tv with a heart i think symbolically we might have  to turn it off you leave the tv on exactly where it is remember this was a bit anthony remember what  when was anything a bit i didn't know when uh you weren't supposed to mix foley came in here you  weren't supposed to fall for that uh anything would happen like that who am i to say anyway so uh off 
[00:16:30]  broadway the lady feels like she has to do that when she met that jill yeah yeah she felt compelled to  do that um they went to a local bar um by my house and uh and then then we wound up going out uh out east  for a um a christening  what you hate kids well and god 
[00:17:00]  but  you hate kids uh you know something i uh went to a christening um because uh jill was the uh the god  mother and uh of the uh child and uh i went to the christening can i back up a second because  out east by my uh i didn't know your parents house i didn't know you were gonna you say that 
[00:17:30]  right away because uh i gotta i gotta fill jimmy in but i decided to check in with ann over the  long weekend and uh my girl was trying on some clothes so i'm sitting in a clothing store bored  because there's nothing for a guy to look at so i i go you know what i'm gonna call ann see how he's  doing i get ann on the phone and ann goes you're not gonna believe where i am i'm like where he goes  the walt whitman mall i'm sitting here as jill gets her nails done well for the christening

[00:29:00]  uh his name is pronounced eiler robert ilia oh you mispronounced his name i'm like so i said his  name wrong and they're like yeah i'm like so what that's how i say it i've always said it that way  i've always said it that way response though i was mortified yeah at what had to happen  and they're like well they won't use it because you know they said his name wrong oh i'm like i have 
[00:29:30]  to go out and and tell the audience what i did and then reintroduce them oh no right oh i am such  a douche i had to go out and i was humiliated i i had to tell the crowd like um well i i mispronounced  robert robert's name so um i'm gonna redo it and he was probably embarrassed yeah of course he was  but i it was the way i've always said his name and nobody told me before the show when i said it 
[00:30:00]  it's not like his name is smith i mean it's a tough name to remember you look i've never heard it said  right only seen it written i think it's i l e r oh it's not i e r i think it's i l e r oh i always i  always so how would you pronounce that you eiler eiler i for some reason had always thought it was  i l i e r it's i l e r all right this well where were you not there sorry so i had to reintroduce 
[00:30:30]  him and you know he was cool about it but i felt really like such it happens to me you can't beat  yourself up the one celebrity that's a tough name to remember how to i don't i wouldn't know how to  pronounce that first of all that looks like two l's to me if you go on imdb it says uh i it's  says uh l l e r there you go but it's i l e r you're right yeah i know but why the i and the l  looking the same i i never understood that i wanted because that looks like l l e r to me yeah  robert rober i was so embarrassed the one celebrity that shows up and i botch it to that james 
[00:31:00]  gundal funny didn't kill him gundal funny or id fulco i stink captain zilch flies into the rest  so when is your hbo show going to be on jimmy in september the episode that's huge yeah i'm very  very psyched very very cool so hopefully uh people will like it all right uh the big news while we  were away the hillary uh clinton rfk thing huh yeah that was uh huh nice little comment she made 
[00:31:30]  didn't she say uh that she had a headache or something and she was okay i feel like rfk in the  kitchen get off the floor you or she spilled ketchup on her shirt something happened she  shouldn't have mentioned it now they said this was going to be a disaster for her and since this  happened it doesn't seem like it's that much of a disaster you know why no one cares about anything  she does good or bad anymore it's not affecting her campaign because she's so out of it she's the 
[00:32:00]  only one that doesn't seem to realize it so even if she has these full paws no one's going to point  it out because why give her any publicity right so obama's not going to jump on it and start really  you know tearing her apart as far as he's concerned uh mccain is is who he's fighting now  you know she's done did you see in the paper everything that's wrong with mccain they showed  his body oh god yeah it was in the paper while we were uh taking a few days off oh my god yeah they 
[00:32:30]  had to take his physical he took his physical and make it uh they had to make it public nothing  that's going to kill him in the next year or two but all these things combined yeah wow he's a wreck  the best part the best one was uh where they said he takes a pill because he gets dizzy every once in  a while i get dizzy what'd he take dramamine not walking what's wrong with him i don't he gets dizzy  look i lean democrat people know that but i don't know if i want my president to get being a little 
[00:33:00]  dizzy and that's how they put it he takes it because he gets dizzy every once in a while he  has a pill for it yeah fine did you find that oh yeah it was hilarious because it was it was a it  was a body shot of mccain head to toe and you know the this whole side of the face was ripped out  with skin cancer skin cancer all over the place with this guy really all over the place jimmy all over  the place yeah wow but that's uh that's one you could cure as long as uh you get it nice and early  yes uh he's had five melanomas removed yeah and that is the most deadly skin cancer yeah yeah and 
[00:33:30]  what was the one procedure they call the evasive is the bad one right uh yeah well if they say evasive  that means that they have to take some stuff out you gotta try and chase it yeah oh wonderful so  that's why they chased it from from his eyeball all the way down to his chin uh wow yeah you gotta say  this anyway where does he vacation invasive later invasive it's called right yeah not evasive right 
[00:34:00]  huh where does he go how much sun does he get yeah right he's so pale yeah but it might have been  part of his torture maybe they left him oh they left him out in the sun let some ants crawl around on  him right there's a war hero and i'm acting like he was vacationing yeah what was he doing lounging  around tied up with bamboo under his fingernails oh i want to i want to put it past these uh these people  from back in the day you know they got a fair-skinned boy there and they're like ah i know  what to do with this one we'll leave him out in the sun and then they laugh and laugh anyway this is 
[00:34:30]  uh what uh hillary said uh you know radio guy says this fired so fired you don't buy the party unity  argument i don't because again i've been around long enough uh you know my husband did not wrap up  the nomination in 1992 until he won the california primary um somewhere in the middle of june right  we all remember bobby kennedy was assassinated in june in california uh  you know i just i don't understand it i don't see that as being like we're just americans are 
[00:35:00]  just babies what did she say and i don't like him what she said she probably would have said the  same exact thing if if it was if she was going up against a white guy that's what i'm thinking  i don't think she was thinking too too closely to what she was saying i mean what was she trying  the point she was trying to make was that he hadn't he hadn't gotten the nomination either  at that point at the race was i don't think she was saying that barack might get assassinated she  was saying that basically the race went that he had just gotten i think yeah he's just about to get 
[00:35:30]  secret service protection and and it just happened like it was still going then yeah what'd she say  wrong and now we're on to the kitchen and that's it she didn't say anything wrong no where my calves  will be mistaken for dinner rolls well well yeah that wasn't uh anything that uh that bad nothing  why is stump brain doing that uh we're we're putting up the jill guard we know why because i know you 
[00:36:00]  don't want us looking at your girl anymore so on jill tv we now have what's called the jill guard  so you get to see her lovely face and those those big those big eyes are hers but we're not going to be  staring at her cleavage in front of you anymore we just can't do it anthony so you put up a piece  of paper over the tv screen how about you put well no just just covering up the the you know  the the goodness just cover up the goodness anthony yeah we still get to see her you know her face 
[00:36:30]  and all and maybe just a tiny bit of cleavage the same amount of cleavage your grandma would uh  maybe expose well and the rest of it is covered up uh for you my friend respect for it respect  respect it's called the jill guard but perhaps i would like to you know right look up every so  often when she's uh doing the traffic report maybe say uh you know see her and then you know what how  about you just close your eyes i'm sure you have i'm sure you have a few images in there that you  could enjoy what we're doing this out of respect for you my friend stunty's a fool why didn't you 
[00:37:00]  raise it and cover the face so we never know who we're looking at oh yeah like this way we wouldn't  feel guilty at all i think that could be linda church oh yeah it could be smug guy wow smug guy  we're just looking at an amazing cleavage let it be known that jim norton said that he could confuse  linda church with your lovely i mean i don't know who it is no no i don't know it could be a new girl  yeah i wouldn't feel guilty looking at a new girl put the jill guard up out of respect out of respect 
[00:37:30]  you can look at the the tv next to it which is on fox five and look at their traffic girl oh thanks  and you know i'm giving i'm letting you thanks i appreciate it hey uh you hear why is the tv off  huh i respect turn that goddamn tv back on you want to make sure she's at work don't you no  i just want to you know also in this in the middle of uh the morning there's another traffic girl in  there and it's got to wonder where where his jill is to occasionally look up and see her her pretty 
[00:38:00]  eyes is there anything wrong with that i play the hillary thing we're gonna move on here we'll we'll  turn on jill for you there you go they'll find her canoodling with mike woods from fox  you'll be in deep trouble you can't follow him no mike woods of course um i play the hillary thing  because it sets up the next um the next slip of the tongue oh this liz trotta have you heard about 
[00:38:30]  this from fox news no wow listen to this one and now we have what uh some are reading as a suggestion  that somebody knock off us osama um uh obama well both which we could talk about how you really feel  what'd she say she basically said both if you could she said that you know obama osama got that  mixed up and then said well both if you know both if you could if you could which is uh oh uh you  know get rid of against uh presidential candidates life pretty much hey oh sweetie yeah yeah yeah 
[00:39:00]  yeah exactly she'll probably be fired for that one because she's a nobody right yeah i gotta say  that i'm usually for free speech but when you're a news anchor and you go well you should kill them if  you can't hey get them both get them both why not i didn't read that as her saying that obama might  be assassinated at all what the hillary one not even no not the hillary one i read that as being we 
[00:39:30]  might still be in this race because stuff is always is finished sometimes in june which are all people  yeah yeah she didn't say anything that even implied that obama should be uh i'm not even gonna say it  you know but no one but she doesn't say any bad about obama being you know hurt no dummies and then  that's all oversensitive well then it uh leads us to what sharon stone said oh good this is a little  break we put together where uh you know people messing up with their speech what she said i should  have shaved that since the camera was on it sharon stone had this to say about the uh the chinese 
[00:40:00]  earthquake now uh did you hear that what there was an aftershock and it knocked down another  what was it a hundred thousand homes or something just the aftershock 200 000 more homes got knocked  down from a from an aftershock wow and they're admitting to what 68 000 dead they're saying that  number will easily be over 80 000 which makes me think it's going to be well over a hundred thousand 
[00:40:30]  when it's all said and done because their buildings aren't like san francisco probably that are made for  please so this is what sharon stone had to say about the earthquake well you know it was very  interesting because at first i'm you know not happy about the way the chinese are treating the tibetans  because i don't think anyone should be unkind to anyone else and so i have been very concerned about  how to think and what to do about that because i don't like that and then all this earthquake and 
[00:41:00]  all this stuff happened and i thought is that karma when you're not nice that the bad things  happen to you and then i got a letter from the tibetan foundation that they wanted to go and be  helpful and that made me cry and they asked me if i would write a quote about that and i said  i would that it was a big lesson to me that sometimes you have to learn to put your head down  and be of service even to people who aren't nice to you put your head down and be of service  sounds like what she should be doing when you haven't worked in a few years shut your mouth 
[00:41:30]  dumb actress do what you do pretend to be interesting this is what happens when they talk publicly  is it just karma karma how can you put like the kids that were killed yeah that's yeah what do they  do wrong yeah the little children the the innocent little ones what a dummy hey let's thanks let's  see if they give her as hard a time as they tried to give jack caffery no of course of course not  they're she's part of the community yep that whole uh liberal uh mess enough with the tibetans 
[00:42:00]  already we get it steven s from basho writes hey uh sharon shut up and show us your clump  clump you stupid bitch show us your clump  that could be my my new favorite word a good word for it get the bumper stickers show us your clump  uh let's go to canada rodney

[00:50:30]  true that you've been giving away some of our tricks of the trade to to jill who's gonna pass  it on to the news director well uh i don't know if she's gonna pass it on but uh we were laughing  about it the fact that i i just said i had to say i go look uh the cw 11 news that you're on  here here in new york city is awful i i didn't say that no but you say that all the time no i'm  not i do not it's not newsy and i'm not saying that all the time in the office that it's a joke 
[00:51:00]  all i did not what i said one of every what you go to their freaking barbecue over the weekend too  what i said was that sometimes they uh their teases aren't put together very well yeah because  they'll tease a a clip that's coming up and let's say like a guy is stuck uh in a tree uh they had  had a guy that fell into like a hole in a tree yeah and uh they say a man fell in a tree it took 
[00:51:30]  people with chainsaws to get him out we'll tell you if he got out all right and the video they show  is the guy getting out of the tree so you already know the answer to the question they just asked  before the commercial so i i just informed her that perhaps you know that uh maybe uh you know  should be remedied and uh smug guy so we love smug guy back to you on the studio

[01:07:30]  what songs were you singing  oh it's just fun songs  i'm gonna guess it was the jingles from beer commercials  like sinatra and his wife  just screaming at each other in the casino  eventually  they've been going out a week  anthony's missed one day  she's missed two already  but i mean  you know  what hope does this have  it was very uh 
[01:08:00]  no she had the christening  so you know  yeah  that's why  it's already like mickey rourke and barfly  and he's a chick  and he'll be puking off the side of the bed  with his waist-like body  like larry and althea  he'll be laying there  she'll be crawling to get high  this is not gonna end well  at all  it's gonna be a problem  althea  oh my god jimmy  it's gonna start with her being just a little off  with her traffic reports  yeah  just a little off  because you know  the booze has taken over 
[01:08:30]  oh no  she's a broadcast professional  yeah  you can't see that  you are too  or anthony's influence  will sneak in  and wreck her traffic reports  like she'll say  well there's traffic  uh  traffic at the midtown tunnel  you know how it is  on jew holidays  did i say that  so anthony  um  what songs  were you singing together  oh god  i can't even remember  i just know that we were  you know  driving 
[01:09:00]  we're driving around  this song comes on the radio  just  blurting it out  singing  you know  like what  anything that would come up  like the other day  i was talking about  you know  uh  long island's own  like eddie money  he'll come on  ugh  oh her blank  her blanks were shaking  hey  well you said eddie money  i know a little bit  about eddie money  i don't think that was  necessary  oh it's a line from shaking  little uh  uh  long island's own 
[01:09:30]  uh pat benatar  love is like a battlefield  um  long island's own  uh billy joel  oh  bottle of red  mm-hmm  mm-hmm  billy joel huh  well yeah  you know  yeah  no we don't know  and i was driving  like him too  believe  here's what's gonna happen  they're gonna be out  and and paradise  by the dashboard lights  is gonna come out  yeah  he's gonna sing the guy part  and she's gonna sing  the girl part  how do you know 
[01:10:00]  uh that wasn't one of the songs  maybe that was  and then  and then she's gonna  never see him again  never  hey  why  don't be mean like that  what songs were you singing  i i really i'm trying to remember  some of the uh  some of the songs  all right  you think about that  i'll think about it  okay  yeah  all right  a little stp  you're checking out  the opian anthony show  we're gonna be seeing stp

[01:11:00]  your jill stuff  i'm trying to get  real info out there  i've foiled  the jill guard  what do you mean  i told her to move  a little to the left  what  well we just moved  our jill guard  now what  now what are you  gonna do  did you really tell her  uh yeah  so you're  you're communicator  communicating with her  see  there she goes  what  move the jill guard  over  i will foil you  she actually moved 
[01:11:30]  to the other side  to the other side  of the screen  and back  hey  move the jill guard  she's going back  and forth  it's perfect  of course  what a trooper  tell her to take off  they moved to the left  i can't see your breasts  on tv  short thing honey  you guys are great  how fantastic is that  you're communicating with her  during the show  you told her that  we have a jill guard up  because we noticed  that she stays on the left  side of the screen  for her traffic reports  and out of respect for you 
[01:12:00]  we put up what's called  the jill guard  so we don't see the  cleavage anymore  you communicated that to her  and now she's moving  all over the screen  see  because i want to see  her acting skills  are awful by the way  you see how  what are you talking about  she made believe  she was just sauntering  over here  she went  she's fantastic  she sauntered over  you're right  it was a saunter  it was like  i'm just gonna  and the whole newsroom  was like  she's never done that  what is she doing 
[01:12:30]  she put her elbows up  it was almost in the  and away we go pose  she put her elbows up  right away  and walked right over  you're gonna ruin this girl  no  make her put on a funny hat  for her next traffic report  like what is going on  all right  let's uh  get back to the uh  the the mixtape  troy's mixtape  wait neither one of you  said said it yet  did you  what  no one said i love you  no that is not 
[01:13:00]  oh i thought you were  gonna say rehab  that's funny  love  is smart  well  rehab  uh  all right uh  troy's mixtape  uh he decided he needs  to sing  to melissa  oh  i think i'll give you  a little song and dance  hi  this is gonna be anthony 
[01:13:30]  in about six months  by the way  the voice is gonna  change everything  yeah  remember when i used  to make you move  on live tv  because i could  i miss those days  i think anthony  can sing though  so with anthony  it won't be as bad  well yeah  he can at least sing  hey you haven't heard  troy sing yet  oh you're ready  i think i'll give you  a little song and dance  are you ready  it might sound  kind of bad  because this microphone  sucks really bad  yeah that's the 
[01:14:00]  oh yeah  that's the mic  sort of tired  but it's not really  like a full song  it's just like a little  clip of it  okay  in all my life  i prefer someone  like you  i thank god  that i  that i finally  found you  and all my life  someone like you 
[01:14:30]  yes i pray  that you  feel the same way  and i hope  that you  do love me  sorry it's not very good  because i'm a little tired  but i try  if you're not the one

[01:15:30]  you're not the one  then what does my hand  fit yours  and what does my soul  feel glad  i just don't even know  maybe it's because you are  haha  you just yearn  for this kid's heart  to be broken  oh  well danny's gonna let us know  what happened to troy  oh really  yeah i think there's an ending here  well  we got one more clip  i love you so much  and  oh  i just  i wish you were here right now 
[01:16:00]  hugging me  and kissing me  maybe a kiss  if you want  it's his mom  but for sure  but maybe a kiss  if you wanted to  now that  would be a dream come true  you are a dream come true  melissa  wait he hasn't kissed her yet  because he's saying that's  that would be a dream come true  i'd like  well if they were  he she was there with him  right then and there  hugging and kissing  oh  i would like to smash his face  with a tennis racket  that's been dipped in crushed glass 
[01:16:30]  just to leave those bloody little  squares on his face  you are a dream come true  melissa  you are the best ever  and that is true  steven s from basher  writes  troy is only slightly less  smitten with melissa  than aunt is with jilzy  wilsey  jilzy wilsey  you are the best ever  ever  you really are  no doubt about it  you're the best ever  no matter what happens 
[01:17:00]  you are the best ever  really  i mean seriously  i'm just trying to show you  how much i love you  in the city  and tell you  so you can always think of me  and know how much i love you  when you listen to this  you're in me melissa  if i lost you  i have lost  i never  got that backwards  maybe not  maybe not  depends on what kind of  belt you own  and by the way  a word of advice  i've never left a mixed tape  but don't do this 
[01:17:30]  every two seconds  and i have bad sign  it's just  you might want to  you know  just kissing you  it reminds me of  sucking back this mucus  and swallowing it  and uh  you've been  you've been so  you've been so good to me  do you want to ease up on that  uh  igor  what hump  i believe that's how he says his name  from the tower  he writes  is there going to be  show content  show content 
[01:18:00]  for those of us  who aren't dating jill  uh  watch  back to  troy's mixtape  if i lost you  i'll be lost  i never ever  ever  ever  ever  ever  ever  ever  ever  ever  ever  ever  ever  ever  even want to sleep  i think about you  my babe  i love you  you are  my babe  my babe  you're my babe  happy six month anniversary

[01:19:00]  troy  well  according to uh  the internet lure  uh  she broke up with  troy  like that  the next day  the next day  thank god  because he's a douche  so much for those many more  uh  six month anniversaries  yeah  yeah  well  what was uh  the reason given  uh  it wasn't stated  oh that's too bad  i would think  that tape  like if a girl got a tape like that  how would you stay with that guy 
[01:19:30]  yeah  he's not uh  he's a little obsessed  i know you do weird stuff  like when you're  when you think you're in love as a kid  but yeah  i never did anything  even remotely close  to that  no  i would just write  anonymous notes  and say if you want me  to tell you who i am  wear a scarf of this color  tomorrow  and she would  and i wouldn't tell her  who i was  did you really  yeah  hot jimmy  yeah  this poor girl's 
[01:20:00]  walking around school  with the dumb scarf  yeah she was one of the really pretty girls in school  and you said  that's brilliant  but  but she wore the scarf  yeah  and didn't  did you say  hi it's me  i'm glad you wore the scarf  no i was  ugly with glasses  and a ball haircut  and it was humiliated  but you had the asteroids record for your hair  but why did you  why did you even bother then  asking her to put the scarf on  i don't know  i mean i don't know  i don't know  i don't know 
[01:20:30]  why did i finally ask her out  but over the phone  and i called her  and this is how i did it  i was  it was like  you don't want to go out with me do you  and she was actually kind of  she's like  no i don't think so  oh  oh  well with a  a pitch like that  well  you don't want to go out with me do you  it was awful  and then i tried  i told you  i tried  i think i told the story  i tried to be funny  i was like  well i guess that's the way the  the ball crumbles  like instead of the ball bounces  or the cookie crumbles  oh no you didn't say that  no you didn't  i did  i tried to be funny  and like say the wrong thing 
[01:21:00]  my head by the way  right now my head is hot  are you sweating  no my scalp itches though  it's itching right  but it's that itch  you can't get to  it's awful  oh god  my soul itching through the top  of my head  i'm itching my head  because of that story  oh is that horrible  let me uh say hi to eric  in new york  eric what's up  hey uh jimmy  i was wondering  do you think that  troy likes her  i think uh  i don't know if troy likes her  no but uh 
[01:21:30]  i mean it sounds to me like  uh  you know  i don't know  troy loves her  i was scared  you weren't gonna do it  jimmy  you would let a lot of  people down  oh no  they love the catchphrases  on this show  who doesn't  uh let's go to that  john mccain photo  so uh  i think it was the daily news  over the weekend  the long holiday weekend  they had a picture of  john mccain  and then all the stuff  that is wrong with him  wow  because he had his physical  that's a lot of stuff  he's uh 71  he's a little guy

[01:22:30]  body mass is good  uh he was a  two a pack a day  smoker until quitting  in 1980  and then it lists  everything that  he's got going on  he's got  that's a lot of stuff  should i just read him  oh yeah  he's got vertigo  he had invasive  uh melanoma removed  from left temple  in 2000  that that means  they had to chase  the damn thing  and really  pretty much just  make you look  really ugly  for a while  uh he's got  the uh cataract surgery

[01:23:30]  and he's got  what's squamous  squamous cell  carcinoma removed  from right shin  earlier this year  is that a bad one  cancer  but it's not as bad  as melanoma  melanoma is worse  yeah  okay so melanoma  is the headliner  and as squam  squamous is the  opening act  that's light  but we should make  uh like an operation  game with mccain's  head  you gotta pull  everything out  i was saying uh  during the break 
[01:24:00]  that this is how  the president looks  after he's been in  office not starting  right  his uh his run  he's taking uh  something to lower  his cholesterol  he takes a pill  to prevent kidney  stones  he takes a pill  to preserve  potassium  he takes baby  aspirin to ward  off heart attack  he takes claritin  and flonase  and uh  xeratec  for nasal  allergies  he takes  ambient  to ambient

[01:30:00]  you got the guys coming  down from canada because  they listen on xm uh  canada of course i think  it would be a great spot  so i emailed uh pete  while i was up there i'm  like look i'm at the  station these guys are  jonesing for the show  what what what can i tell  them and i haven't heard  from them yet oh boy so i  don't know if that's that  doesn't sound like it's  good news oh for  traveling virus by the  way i went to autos for  a barbecue no he  actually has a funny  idea i'm not gonna say  it on the air for a  little short film to  show at the traveling 
[01:30:30]  virus one of the short  films he uh shot in  studio no but we  couldn't put the tape  in yeah yeah yeah  that was just look it's  so easy that's the best  part auto from auto  george came in with  like one of those  zapruder like freaking  yeah cameras and try to  film camera yeah yeah  and try to film us and  it was just a disaster  for everybody involved  because he was he was  touting how easy it was  and that was the the  selling point of the  camera yeah that was a  piece of cake and he  basically had to pull out  a sledgehammer and  smash the tape in but 
[01:31:00]  uh it was actually very  funny i think it would  be a hit with the kids  absolutely with us  starring of course uh  nice did you guys hear  about this minor leaguer  it's my favorite sports  story a lot of sports  was uh happening since  the last live show we  did here uh this john  odom was traded for bats  why are you kidding  and not the flying  variety by the way that  would that would be  kind of cool uh john  odom was traded from  uh the calgary vipers a  minor league team to the  uh what is it loretto 
[01:31:30]  loretto loretto uh broncos  okay i couldn't read this  uh for 10 bats  he was traded for 10 bats  he must suck  really good bats  what was the negotiations  like we'll give you uh  we'll give you five bats  no no we want 15  we're not giving up 15  bats we'll give you 10  sold  uh each bat cost 70  dollars so uh he was  wow  for 700 dollars basically 
[01:32:00]  this poor guy  wow  see what happened though  apparently a minor  criminal offense from his  youth kept him out of  canada  so somebody with a bat  there's the  there it is jimmy very  good  yeah he was traded to a  canadian team they can't  use him because he can't  cross the border so they're  like look we officially  have him so i don't know  give us 10 bats and you  could have him now  speaking of being arrested  oh do we know what he was  convicted of or no  oh we don't okay  we don't know uh we  should know that should be  like public knowledge 
[01:32:30]  it just is a minor criminal  offense that he thought was  expunged from his record  oh kind of like e-rock  yeah e-rock casually we've  been on the air for over  two hours and oh my god i  know oh i go e-rock how  was your uh time off he  goes well i almost got  arrested when were you  going to tell us  and what did you do did you  burp and get charged with  air pollution  oh damn  i don't like that i like how  jimmy can't even look at  him when he says lines like 
[01:33:00]  that i love eric of course  young e-rock of course you  mean it  sorry how could you not  e-rock what happened that  you almost uh got arrested  well before we went on  break i found that i had a  couple of parking tickets  that i never paid from last  year  oh scofflaw  so  um after thursday show i  went down to the uh the  courthouse to pay them  because they won't let you  pay it online it says you  must go to the courthouse  so i go to the courthouse she  looks at it and she said oh  this is going to be um like 
[01:33:30]  120 bucks um they don't take  card or anything i said is  there's an atm around it's uh  next door so i go and i leave  i hit the atm and then i come  back and the lady's freaking  out she goes oh my god you  weren't supposed to i wasn't  supposed to let you leave  i go why and she goes there's  a warrant for your arrest  because i hadn't paid two  parking tickets  so you and you weren't  supposed to be able to just  walk out of the uh yeah she  told me where the atm was it  was in a store next to the  courthouse and then i came back  to pay the ticket and she was  freaking out because she 
[01:34:00]  didn't realize that there was a  warrant for my arrest on these  two tickets which i wasn't  aware of either so um i'm  sitting there i'm waiting and  they finally get somebody out  there and they said we got to  take your photo and um a writer  from illinois has a few choice  words for new yorkers who curse  loudly on the subway  he goes great that's just great  wait you got like booked you got 
[01:34:30]  wait they said take a photo they  were gonna have to take my photo  and get some other it's called a  mug shot yeah well because take my  photo what are you in a high school  yearbook picture sitting what else  do they want to do like dip your  hand in ink and make like a like a  thanksgiving turkey no they did  they wound up of course no that  was a joke jimmy was making him  funny i got it yeah  is a complete lack of respect for 
[01:35:00]  the law  no but because the lady let me leave  not realizing that there was a  warrant for for my arrest um i guess  she got some heat and they they just  bypassed the photo i paid the fine and  then i was out would they have  arrested you if you're gonna pay the  fine anyway if if i had not went down  to pay for it if i got pulled over i  would have been arrested of course but  i mean let's not let's not put  circumstances that have nothing to do  with it yeah if you're robbing a liquor  store you probably have to pay these 
[01:35:30]  i don't know they didn't uh say  anything other than they were  yelling at the lady because she let me  leave did they yell at her will be  that her supervisor was yelling at  her i would say i i don't remember  it was behind this huge thing of  glass that's like bulletproof glass  that they have there did he really  yell yeah he did he probably he  probably didn't yell he probably just  hit up that you shouldn't let him go  don't do that again she's like oh  yeah that's right and iraq was like  seeing it like yo what are you doing  letting this criminal back on the 
[01:36:00]  streets acting like it's a scene at a  dog day afternoon  crazy he was just pointing at the  computer screen and just like leaning  down and yelling at her because she  let me leave when there was a warrant  for my arrest  maybe he's pointing at the computer  screen saying stop going into  instant message i'm trying to read a  feedback  or how many calories does this guy  eat  who is that portly boy  we're gonna need a bigger lens for the

[01:42:30]  the highways are going to be clear you're you're ruining my commute when are you going to see her  again as soon as possible as soon as possible as soon as possible  hey a writer from illinois has a few choice words for new yorkers who curse loudly on the subway  he uh says that's a bunch of balderdash yeah i like this guy uh jim o'connor is uh an expletives 
[01:43:00]  expert who's written a self-help book about how to drop the f word and s word in favor of more ear  pleasing options what yes instead of uh the s word he suggests using shoot that how old is that  that's kind of where shoot came from instead of the s word he suggests using shoot  and he wants uh new yorkers to try bungled next time you want to say the next time you want to say 
[01:43:30]  effed up yeah so instead of saying i effed up he wants you to say i bungled i bunghold what the only  thing that should be bungled is the investigation into his murder on the train when he tells them  what in tarnation are you doing tarnation bash his brains in with a wrench i hate him the mild  mannered author of uh curse control no it's called cuss control cuss control cuss control you're right 
[01:44:00]  faces tough as audience yet in a rush hour train ride with the daily news and harried new yorkers  jostling to get home jostling uh do you swear o'connor asked one commuter as he squeezed into a car  on the l train at eighth avenue um yeah he replied orally and i'm surprised people are not swearing  at you now you're blocking the door swearing just comes out it's an emotional outburst that you can 
[01:44:30]  you can't control he said but the f word and the s word are vague they don't communicate much and  there are uh they don't communicate much that they communicate a hell of a lot those two words  they sure do you drop a c-bomb says a mouthful argument over uh but the f word and s word are  vague they don't communicate much and there are all these beautiful words both positive and negative  that people just don't use in cuss control o'connor writes that cultural influences and laziness  generally cause excessive swearing but in big cities like new york swear words are also used to 
[01:45:00]  relieve the pressure of daily life you have to try to think this guy did not bang into you  intentionally you just happened to be in the way he said don't take it personally but there's no  quick cure you can't just become a tolerant person this guy what we got to get this guy in the phone  this guy sounds like a real card-sucking fudget  o'connor who admitted he still swears a little said it's still okay to curse when it uh will have an 
[01:45:30]  impact i've tried to stop completely and i can't so i don't expect anybody else to he said but there  are loads of alternatives that can take the bite away and you can actually amuse people rather than  make them uncomfortable everyone uses a-hole but i like the word gargoyle instead that's a funny word  he says is it wow here are some of jim connor's curse word replacements so really so what what should  happen to this guy is a gang should attack him and someone should put their clutch in his gargoyle 
[01:46:00]  uh the s word he suggests yes shoot f word bungled as in it's all bungled up the bs word should be  uh balderdash or uh bolshevik yes bolshevik as in that's a bunch of bolshevik  exactly look at his picture right there and the a word should be gargoyle it's it's it's bill o'reilly 
[01:46:30]  he's a creep bill o'reilly's twit everyone's looking at him like you nerd oh uh well mongo the  trucker has a question mongo uh does that mean that anthony uh bungled jill in a shooter all right  hey hey i hope he gets attacked on the train by a gang of nibblers  we're trying to get this guy to the phone  oh oh he's got a tool by the way fan brought something um yeah oh what there's none of this 
[01:47:00]  is highlighted it was called 10 tips for taming your tongue all starts with the t folks  and what's this about jimmy i don't know this i just picked it up in this the whole page of  boulder dash  what is it then that's off cusscontrol.com this website oh thank god so that we can learn more  about this yeah now you're making a real gargoyle out of me gargoyle it would be laughed at and then 
[01:47:30]  kicked in the gut of course you would especially if your gargoyle had white stuff leaking out of  that's what we do in your words stupid you pillow biter right you gotta lay on your stomach because  your gargoyle sore  a little too much cork your science queen  way to know new yorkers what an idiot yeah that's gonna take off ridiculous uh it's a slow news day 
[01:48:00]  but i'm happy to report that uh there's a there's a good outcome to the next story i'm about to play  for everybody uh you know a father and daughter they got um stuck on a ride at fun zone  if you have to call your place fun zone there is nothing fun about it sounds fun it's right in the 
[01:48:30]  name fun zone it's got to be fun it's right there fun zone well as soon as you leave the place uh you're  out of the fun zone no more fun then no more fun for you this is what happened well the father and  his young daughter are rescued after being trapped on a ride in an indoor amusement center on long  island sex swing  the fun zone is a swing club  he brings his young daughter with him  it was incest night in the fun zone what a creep 
[01:49:00]  a fun zone  oh now her gargoyle hurts  that's true  he got his nunzios all tangled in the chain  his clutch ring wouldn't come off  long island 
[01:49:30]  the two were stuck in a virtual reality flight simulator at fun zone in farmingdale  officials say they were trapped upside down in a reclining position for nearly 20 minutes before  firefighters would rescue them  how stupid do you have to be  undo your seat belt or whatever the hell and then then then get yourself right side up  get out it's not a roller coaster it's it's it's it's one of those simulators  yeah  so you're upside down who cares  it wasn't a real plane  no i'm kidding 
[01:50:00]  idiots  we don't have power we don't have virtual parachutes  what happened in the virtual thing the uh the virtual food came late and they  right  we did it  they act like these two were tortured like mccain  20 minutes upside down on a ride get a hold of yourselves  the fire department came and hopefully hosed them  being stupid  had to hose them to get them apart  like two dogs in the street  this is a fun zone you pigs  that's not considered fun here  someone wants to change gargoyle to uh mud valve 
[01:50:30]  what  he's saying best word ever mud valve  well that's my potato flakes in the mud valve  best replacement word ever is mud valve  got a bunch of mushroom soup in your gargoyle  why gargoyle  because it's terrible  mushroom soup  oh that's terrible 
[01:51:00]  i do like mud valve  horrid  let's not forget we uh we we introduced the word clump today too  yeah one of our fine listeners came up with clump today  what's up  yeah  uh yeah i know  all right here's more of the fun zone  upside down in a reclining position for nearly 20 minutes before firefighters would rescue them  both made it out  okay 
[01:51:30]  that's a scary  that's my biggest nightmare getting strapped in the things and not getting out  nah  nah  there's nothing scary about it  you're upside down and your head is two inches from the floor  you're not moving the thing is in danger of falling plummeting like 80 feet to the ground  dummies  that happens while you're in an office building  you're probably gonna be frightened  oh it's my biggest fear  you fairy  yeah  creeps  hey be careful we got that story from channel 11 
[01:52:00]  oh  well it's accurate reporting then  yeah of course it is  i'd love to be able to see channel 11 but  you know i don't really like the idea that that's that tv's turned off  i'm sorry what can i tell you you know  i like it on it makes me uh  i went too far with my jokes and i want to acknowledge that  but i also want to make sure we never do that again  so we got to get rid of this whole jill thing  but it makes me happy to have it on  don't you want a happy anthony  yeah this is balderdash  i don't like it 
[01:52:30]  uh in case you weren't listening earlier  here's your anthony update for  today  back with a new week  oh what happened  okay here we go  here we go  we're back with a new week  and a new update on the anthony cumia  jill nicolini relationship  now simply known as anthony  the two spent a fun filled  memorial day weekend together  starting with an fh riley's  dinnertime grope fest  i mean you want to talk about pda  oh my god  and ending with jill meeting the cumia clan 
[01:53:00]  it seems like uh  jill's parents were getting along great with my mother and sal  look at jimmy's face  after an action-packed christening  anthony mingled with family members  posed for pictures  and daydreamed about their future together  as they held anthony's baby niece  could the long island royalty known as anthony  be looking for a castle of their own to share  stay tuned as the anthony saga continues  like a lot of speculation in there 
[01:53:30]  can we like  call it the uh  what were you calling it  long island royalty  but we like long island  long island rubbish  rubbish  anyone else notice that young sam sounds like  a very mellow version of  max x  max x  max x  that had a hurt  anthony  hate that guy  yeah  horrible things can be happening  and he makes it like  whoa  he lost his legs in this one 
[01:54:00]  right  it's like man  sam's got that same voice  do that comedic delivery  when you're talking about  somebody being paralyzed  uh i want to say  here's the part where his head flies off  we're going back to replacement words  and uh  i remember schubert used to do this one too  with the stink wrinkle  i was making mud pies out of his stink wrinkle  all right 
[01:54:30]  well  wow the fun zone is a big arcade in  nathan's  in nathan's  so it's not even its own fun zone  it has to be part of something else  it's the  deal  yeah  so you get some hot dogs  and then you go into the fun zone for a little while  that's great  that wouldn't promote vomiting at all  a bunch of hot dogs are getting that thing  a bunch of dogs with crowd on them  and you and your dumb daughter upside down 
[01:55:00]  puking up your own nostrils  your dumb daughter  upside down for 20 minutes  losing your  losing your uh  chute  yeah losing your chute  losing your chute  how old was the kid did they say  was she like really young  35  she probably was  yeah  uh let's go to peter on long island  peter  hey what's up  hey  hello  i'm peter  you're on the air sir  speak  hey uh  when i was like 12  i went to a fun zone

[01:56:00]  in one of the rubber bands  wrapped around my neck  and i almost  i had to uh  be pulled out of there  almost died  you were choking  yes  i couldn't breathe  what year was that  what year  yeah do you remember  i don't know  um  ten years ago  to 1998  actually i think i actually heard about that  where was it  at the fun zone  no but which one  uh  in cardin city  what's that  in long island right  yeah  you  you  did they have to  how'd they get you out  uh 
[01:56:30]  a human  pulled me  oh guys  pulled you right  okay  i remember that was in the paper actually  you do remember this jimmy  no  i've never heard of this  anything before in my life  i'm just trying to get this guy going  all right thank you peter  thank god you're alive peter  we have to take a break  because we have our exclusive interview  with uh  jim o'connor next  from  cuss uh  i want to talk to jim  because i kind of like what he's doing  i mean i think the idea of it is good  uh  there's a little too much of it  uh  on the subway  and uh  just in daily life 
[01:57:00]  if the guy's gonna cut down on profanity  i am all for that  all right um  i'm thinking we'd go old school with this one  what do you think jimmy  i think so too  i mean uh  all right  i think that uh  you know  we should  get the phone ready there travis  uh  we got jim o'connor next  opie and anthony  it's the opie and anthony show  thanks for checking us out today  we uh  greatly appreciate it  want to say hi to mark in canada  real fast here  uh  mark what's up 
[01:57:30]  hey how's it going  good mark  uh  just trying to say  you guys are killing me today  you're awesome  love the show  uh  cuss words  switching around  that  that was just hilarious  well we're gonna have the author on in a second here  his name's jim o'connor  we want to take this very seriously mark  because uh  i uh  along with the rest of the guys around here  we do believe that uh  there's too much cursing going on in society today  and uh  there's another way to handle that 
[01:58:00]  by using some of these replacement words  uh jim o'connor taught us that  instead of saying the s word  you say shoot  instead of saying f'd up  you say uh bungled  right  yeah  very clever  it wasn't bungled  i forgot already  bungled  and uh  balderdash  instead of the bs  and uh  and gargoyle  instead of a-hole  i want to ask him uh  and uh  why  like what's the purpose of this  yeah this is a very very important uh  to be a more polite  uh kind of a thing  that's  well let's say hi to jim o'connor 
[01:58:30]  joining our show today  jim  yeah  mr o'connor  if you will  how are you  i'm just fine  how you doing  welcome aboard jim  thanks for uh calling our show  so uh  uh  your  your book got our attention today  yeah well yeah  it amuses people  for one thing  you actually uh  came down to new york  and you were  in the subways  kind of like uh  giving people a lesson  on uh cursing  well i was just down there  uh trying to  get an example of uh  what causes all the cursing  it's pretty hectic down there  pretty hectic  indeed my friend  yeah  indeed 
[01:59:00]  and uh  so what  what  actually  is the  the purpose  of replacing  these uh  curse words  with the words  that you suggest  well it's not really  so much replacing the words  it's learning to cope  with the situation  uh  because when you get angry  and square  it doesn't really  accomplish much  you know  so uh  if you use other words  that are  well jim  a lot of people  would disagree with you  i think it accomplishes a lot  it gets a little  a little stress out  makes you feel a little  better inside  that you could actually  react to the situation 
[01:59:30]  it does  it's sort of a defensive  thing  it's uh  you know  your ego is hurt  when someone bumps into you  and you don't swear back  but  and i think it adds more stress  to the whole environment  because if you're  someone else  and you hear  two people yelling  and swearing each other  it adds to your stress  oh  just deal with it  except you know  the guy didn't intend  to bump into me  he was just in a hurry  and it just happens  it's uh  it's chaotic  and then this  this goes on  well uh  and you  you've uh  suggested replacement words  uh  the first one  for the s word  yeah  saying shoot 
[02:00:00]  in new york city  that could uh  get you in a lot of trouble  oh  how about you  oh  good gosh  i wasn't sure  you had a sense of humor  i was a little worried  to use that type of  you know  material on you  mr o'connor  that's right  all right  thank you  okay  it's really  it's just a question  of uh  two things  civility  you know  we need a little  more manners  yeah we do  i think  i think this city  uh  you know  we were  we're very impersonal  and um  i don't think  uh  people really  take into consideration 
[02:00:30]  other people's feelings  so uh  to hear people  cursing like that  i believe  i've always thought  it rude  yeah  yeah  and uh  some of these suggestions  for uh  replacement words  i think  gets the point across  but like you said  civility  yeah it is  and i'm not totally  opposed to swearing  i mean  it's  it's part of our language  it's one way we communicate  but uh  it really doesn't do  that much good  you can  you can get by  without doing it  yeah absolutely 
[02:01:00]  once in a while  you know  someone makes you mad  or you get impatient  it just flies out of your mouth  what are some of the  replacement words  you suggest  well you know  you can use any word you want  because you know  most of us have  replacement words  uh  uh  you know  you're in a situation  where you know  you can't swear  it's just totally unacceptable  so you  you say shoot  you say darn it  you say  nuts  you know  you say whatever it is  but uh  like the f word  everyone knows  you use the f word  and yeah  fudge doesn't work  uh  i admit to that  but  it's when you  everyone's always  effing everything up 
[02:01:30]  instead of bungling it up  or botching it up  or messing it up  it's just a crass word  that's getting  worn out  yeah  well um  i know you have  uh  shoot for the s word  uh bungled  instead of the f word  yeah  or f  f'd up  it should be bungled  the whole point is like  uh  another one is  uh  that's a bunch of  balderdash  or that's hogwash  or that's uh  hogwash yeah  hogwash nonsense  rubbish  these are some of the classics  i want to be very careful  how i say this 
[02:02:00]  uh  but is there one for  um  you know  uh  when you call someone  a uh  a d  uh  yeah  you can say  jerk  you know  say you're  uh  um  of  you know  one of my favorite words  is uh  you know  we can't think of it  right now  oh  gosh  you know  it's uh  uh  what's the monster  up on the building  oh the uh  that  that  gargoyle  yeah  yeah  it's a funny word 
[02:02:30]  i think gargoyle  is a funny word  and it's  you know  if you know  what an argo gargoyle is  it is a kind of  a creepy looking creature  and you know  you call someone a gargoyle  you're less likely  to get punched in the face  so what  instead of uh  calling them like an a  yeah  or an a-hole  yeah  so you think uh  a gargoyle's that ugly  i guess huh  well yeah  yeah  and it just uh  you know  it gets the message across  without being too uh  outrageous  i like using the word clump  yeah clump is a good one  that's a good one  uh  jim uh  we started talking about this 
[02:03:00]  about 15-20 minutes ago  when it was brought to our attention  that's why we had to search you out  the phones are lit  my friend  is that right  yes let's say hi to um  steve  from yellowstone  hello  steve  hello is this mr o'connor  yes  hi how are you  i'm really enjoying the discussion  good  i find that there's far too much  profanity used in daily life  but i i was wondering  like a lot of my  my my friends will curse  because they try to like  navigate my website 
[02:03:30]  and they can't  because it's so poorly done  what do i do if i have  change your website  a lot of  friends  cursing  they're cursing on  how are they cursing  on your website  but just no  no i mean like  uh steve what do you mean  yeah  in general  they're cursing  and it's very difficult  are they on the phone with you  are they  yes  i ask my friends  not to use that type of language  around me 
[02:04:00]  because they're going  they're going to laugh at me  oh okay  they're going to laugh at you  yeah or just think  i'd be disrespectful  i don't know what to do  well  just uh  ask them to be a little more polite  if they  ramon  hogwash is what jim does in the tub  after he abuses the gargoyle of a fat girl  ramon  jim o'connor's mother  started a video called  two girls  one cup of bolshevik 
[02:04:30]  ramon  the next time he's on the subway  he should be given a lesson  by bernhard  gets  well he's a very upset man  oh my goodness sir  uh jim i apologize  a lot of  a lot of times i get callers like that  that uh  you know  he's a very unhappy person  uh yeah well  for the last of course  he's going for the last  but  yeah i think he  i think he was  yeah  i'm sorry about that  um  there was something else i wanted to ask you about this 
[02:05:00]  uh this uh cussing  you got it  you got a book or something there jim  yeah cuss control  the complete book on how to curb your cursing  okay  not how to stop  but how to curb it  how to control it  how to be more civilized  you have to see the thing is  when you allow yourself to get upset  you know you think it feels good  yeah  it  it only  it doesn't help that much  it's hard just to deal with stuff the best you can  you can't do it all the time  all right let's take another phone call  we got paul from uh totsville  uh paul  hello  hi paul you're on with jim o'connor 
[02:05:30]  yeah  uh i'm a teacher  i teach grade school  and uh it's so difficult  to uh to get the kids to talk right  i mean when you  you mention that to them  they start to think you're like an old  sorry buddy  yeah well  you know it's very difficult  to ask them  i'm sure it is  the kids are growing up in a cursing culture  they're probably even hearing  from their parents  yeah but what do you  what do you do to keep them from doing that  and to keep them from tatling  and things like that  well you say  well did you  ramon 
[02:06:00]  jim o'connor is a balder douche  ramon  i'd like to kick this fruit right in the clump  jim o'connor has to be taken to the emergency room to have a trophy removed from his gargoyle  ramon  after a date  jim o'connor has a load of chute on his clutch 
[02:06:30]  the same joke twice  this doesn't work  ramon  jim o'connor  should bungle his mother in the dark  you know when you yell like that he can't understand what you're saying  yeah i know  he uh  that's the same joke fight  i know  you guys gotta be more original  same guy  i have no i apologize  sometimes they get through twice like that through the screener using a different voice 
[02:07:00]  mr o'connor  i think from the other side of the studio  yeah  that's a shame  well it kind of ruined the whole experience  whole vibe  all right  as long as you guys are having fun you know  sometimes swearing is fun sometimes it's funny  well sometimes  yeah you know the worst is when you swear at somebody and that's what he's doing  so that's kind of crude but  yeah that is  wait uh  he was cursing on you you think  it was hard to tell 
[02:07:30]  the sound was very bad  but yes i have a hunch that's what he was doing  yeah  yeah  that would be  no because we're not allowed to have curses on uh  the radio so  i hope you didn't i didn't hear any uh  hope it didn't go through  you probably don't have very many listeners so it doesn't matter  yeah  we don't yeah  well way to hurt feelings  why why are you taking that out on us  because  yeah  the phone screener didn't know what he was doing  somehow i get the feeling it's an in-studio call  really  how is that possible  well you know  i've been on the radio before 
[02:08:00]  i know how it works  really  yeah i think i'll be original  do you you cunt  i gotta get to work  thanks for calling  i bet you do  i hope you're  i hope uh  man comes and removes your hat  hope you get a mouthful of potato flakes at work  you silly goose  so long gargoyle 
[02:08:30]  stupid replacement words  and then he's gotta say that we don't have listeners  right  exactly  jesus  he goes guys that's not working  same joke twice  trust me  it worked perfectly  of course it did  perfectly well for the faithful listeners  yeah i thought those were two home runs jimbo  hey we have to agree to disagree on that one  take your euphemisms and hang yourself  schmuck 
[02:09:00]  a bunch of boulder dash  boulder dash  shut up  idiot  bringing his mother into it  her gargoyle should be  what was the hogwash  that was brilliant  oh can you use the hogwash  reread that  well the caller said that hogwash  is what jim does in the tub  after he abuses the gargoyle  with a fat girl  inside the tub looks like tomato soup 
[02:09:30]  do you think he hung the phone up  and just like started going off  saying those effing a  oh of course he did  yeah  no he probably didn't curse  i'm thinking he was probably cursing  those hash browns  dork  amazing  very good  cuss control  that was a good call  yeah i liked it  good interview  what a great book that's going to be  yeah  180 sheets of toilet paper  what a tool 
[02:10:00]  oh god  i can't give this guy credit  because he didn't leave his name  because it's from a mobile device  uh this guy is a uh  um  a uh  huh  we were calling uh  bob kelly this uh  a week ago  a fat  yeah  a blank  untalented  a blank eater  stupid  a blank eater  oh right right right  all right we got a quickie before we go here  woman uh  faints while interviewing to be on  american gladiators  yes  all right i like to say i have a flu

So you've been stabbed once and shot twice.  No, I've been stabbed twice.  Shot twice.  Who's the common denominator with all these problems?  Ricky and Anthony.  You have to lick a swath of the icing off so that bag shows through where icing was. 
[02:15:00]  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Here we are, XM Satellite Radio.  First instant feedback is someone bitching.  Fast Freddy, what the fuck?  Jamaica Station, last Thursday's XM show, what the fuck?  We did a half a show on Thursday so I could catch a flight. 
[02:15:30]  We did do an XM show last Thursday.  Yeah.  If you have XM Satellite Radio, you heard brand new material.  Right.  That's how we look at this whole fucking mess.  Yeah.  We do our show.  Our show.  It goes from 6 a.m. till 11 a.m.  Or sometimes later.  And sometimes later than 11.  Most times later than 11.  So what's the problem?  What's the problem?  And Thursday's show, because it was just the show, was hilarious. 
[02:16:00]  It was just a shorter than usual show.  Problem?  Problem?  Apple.  I'm opening my motherfucking gift.  Yeah, what'd you get there, Jimmy?  I wanted to take all of Thursday off and then we decided, well, let's at least try to do  a half a show because we could squeeze that in before a flight.  Yeah.  And then you got Fast Freddy bitching right off the bat like that.  Fast Freddy's usually what?  A good guy?  Or is he usually a douche?  The fastest?  Douche?  I think he's usually all right. 
[02:16:30]  No, he goes either way.  He's a wish and a wash.  Oh.  He's a bitching complainer.  Jimmy, what do you got over there?  I don't know.  I'm opening the motherfuckers.  You got a big present.  Jimmy got a big gift.  Big boy's got a present.  It looks like it's probably some kind of big framed poster.  No, it's not heavy enough to be framed.  No?  As soon as I lifted it up, my fucking heart sank in disappointment.  Ah, you just went like, fuck, it's not a frame.  Whoever sent me this already, I'm saying thanks for nothing. 
[02:17:00]  I'm kidding.  Of course.  All right.  You will in a minute.  I don't know.  It might be.  The listeners have been very generous with little Jimmy Norton.  Well, they certainly happen.  That's very appreciated.  I haven't got much Nazi memorabilia lately, though.  All right, well.  Dr. Steve sent me blueberry muffins for my birthday and flowers for the girl for what  she went through recently.  I thought Dr. Steve's a nice guy.  Slash creep.  He's a nice guy.  He actually sent me a cream for my piles. 
[02:17:30]  He's a slash creep.  You're a weirdo.  You have roids?  No, but I'm just saying he sends the weirdest combination of shit.  Oh, I got you.  Well, he sent my girl flowers for her birthday, and I told him I was on a long flight, so he  sent me a roid popper.  It's a new piece of metal in the medical community.  Fucking loon.  He also sent me crumpets, too.  I've never seen one of these crumpets.  You've had a crumpet?  And now it's Fast Friday.  Stop it.  That's the CBS show, Simulcast and XM.  That's the way we see it.  F you.  Well, too bad.  That's not how we see it. 
[02:18:00]  We do an XM satellite radio program from 6 to 11.  It is also broadcast on CBS radio from 6 till 9.  Right.  Deal with it.  Just because you don't hear, fuck, oh, can't be a good show.  He's not saying shit.  Or cunt.  Right.  Exactly.  Or a fart bubble in the pussy.  Shut up. 
[02:18:30]  Just shut up and enjoy the show.  And if you don't enjoy the show, then I guess you've got to cancel.  Then leave.  That's the best I can tell you guys.  Or ass-eating points.  Right.  That, too.  Or piss-drinking juice.  All right.  What do you got there, Jimmy?  Jimmy's got a problem opening a box is what he's got.  It looks to be a large box.  I'd say it's about two feet wide by...  Three or four feet wide. 
[02:19:00]  I take it out, and inside is a smaller thing.  Oh, my God.  Bubble wrap.  Bubble wrap.  Is that it, or is there anything else in there?  Do you know what's inside the bubble wrap thing?  I'm going to open it now.  Let me see what's in here.  I bet.  Let's just open it and see if anything's missing.  He's shaking the box.  One of these slaves' cleanup.  He's taking the bubble wrap off. 
[02:19:30]  I don't know.  It's looking chintzy now.  Chintzy.  That's a good word.  Chintzy.  Oh, no.  Some listener may have spent some hard-earned money on this.  Maybe.  Chiseling fucks.  Maybe.  All right.  Now you've got the bubble wrap coming off.  Bubble wrap is...  I like the fact they sent it bubble wrapped, and inside it's all...  Uh-oh.  Yes, Jimmy?  What is it?  Jimmy.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  What the fuck?  Why would anyone do that? 
[02:20:00]  Why would anyone?  Let me see it, Jimmy.  Turn it around so we can see.  It's...  It's...  What the fuck is it, Jimmy?  It's pictures of...  Tits, and asses, and naked women.  It's all...  It's all women.  Look.  It's called a collage.  It's a collage.  It's a collage, right.  It says, wow, danger.  Wow, danger.  Lots and lots of boobies, and anuses.  And tit shots.  And gargoyles. 
[02:20:30]  Lots of gargoyles.  It was bubble wrap...  It's made on some kind of styrofoam that's already bent and breaking.  I think it's a bit of decoupage.  Is that a decoupage?  I believe Jimmy was the decoupage of boobies.  Decapage?  Decapage.  I think that's the name you use if you're into that arts and crafts thing.  Or hunk of shit.  That's a word you might want to use.  Hunk of shit.  But no, I actually look... 
[02:21:00]  I want to thank the five-year-old that made this.  Obviously, they put a lot of effort into it, so...  Yeah.  We'll leave it up here in the office.  Let me see that.  No, don't break it.  Let me...  I swear to God, I won't break it.  I really got to see it up close.  There's actually one really good blowjob moment here.  I can't talk that much because I'm actually...  Who is that?  Who's on the fucking phone?  Who doesn't know you're on the fucking radio?  Who the fuck is on the phone?  He's on the fucking radio.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  It scared me.  It said, you know, alarm.  It's the alarm company.  Oh.  But it's the guy that wants to do the sound system installation in my house. 
[02:21:30]  Does he not know what you do for a living?  That silly shit dick.  And apparently he has no...  He doesn't listen because if he did, he'd know I already have a sound system put in.  Oh, boy.  What a fucking asshole he sounds like.  Yes.  I hope he suffers in a cancer ward.  Oh, God.  Now, what about this decoupage?  Well, I'm reading...  What's the back of duct tape on it?  And then it says, there's one caption that says, I'll bend you over and fuck you with  my big strap on. 
[02:22:00]  Whoa.  Happy birthday, Jimmy, it says.  I'd like to take that down to the range and shoot it.  You know, Jimmy, the guy put a lot of work in this.  He sure did.  Hand it to Anthony.  He's got the suggestion.  I would like to take it to the range and just shoot it.  Can you video that?  I'd have to go out to Calverton to do that, though.  That's worth it.  If they even allowed me.  That's worth it.  Why don't you hang...  Where's your basement?  Jimmy, why don't you hang this next to your picture of Black Sabbath signed?  Yeah, why don't you do that?  Hang it up on your wall in your apartment.  Jimmy, don't be...  It's a listener.  I see a hacksaw and a hammer being brought over. 
[02:22:30]  Here, Jimmy.  The hammer would go into that girl's head really nicely.  The claw side.  There was a girl with a nice big tits.  I can't ruin the guy's gift because he put a lot of effort into it.  You could tell there was a lot of work put into this.  Yeah, I can't wreck it.  Why don't you get a picture for the website?  The folks will enjoy the decoupage.  A picture of me holding the decoupage.  The decoupage.  Thank you, Greg, for this decoupage.  I didn't know what it was called.  Apparently, it's a decoupage.  How lovely.  The boy put so much effort into my decoupage gift. 
[02:23:00]  What a birthday gift.  Who sent it?  I don't know.  Let me go check.  Who is the creator of such a decoupage?  I don't quite know.  This is called a boy and his decoupage, Iroch.  Yeah.  Well, pose with your decoupage.  I did.  Iroch took a picture.  Oh, okay.  We're all set?  All right.  Get that up.  Now, Jimmy's now searching out the box.  A decoupage.  We've got to thank the listener for sending in the decoupage.  The pinos. 
[02:23:30]  Huh?  The pinos.  The pinos.  It's called the pinos.  P-I-N-O-S.  The pinos.  The pinos.  The pinos are family or friends.  Or a company.  I don't know.  Are they a decoupage conglomerate?  They're taking over the decoupage industry.  Mr. Decoupage.  Out of the question.  Decoupage.  What is a decoupage? 
[02:24:00]  He's right.  I know.  I'm sure he is, but what is exactly the definition?  It's the horse shit you're looking at.  Of pictures pasted on some type of board.  That'll do it.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Decoupage.  Did that guy really see me?  What happened?  On line three?  What happened?  Did he really see me?  Oh, boy.  I have a little joke here.  Look.  Yeah.  Our honorary guest for the day.  It's a decoupage.  Say something.  Jimmy set it up on a chair and gave it a microphone.  That's our guest for the day.  The decoupage. 
[02:24:30]  It's set up.  Say something.  Well, it's trying.  It's shy.  It's trying, but pretty much every mouth in the decoupage has a cock in it.  Yeah.  I mean, it's kind of hard to talk.  Right.  Decoupage.  Let's say hi to Steve on Long Island.  Steve.  Hey.  How are you?  Hi, Steve.  Good.  How are you?  Good.  So what's up?  I'm on Patchogue Holbrook Road on Saturday night from Holbrook, headed to a wedding.  And I see this red Shelby pull up behind me.  And my girlfriend's in the passenger seat. 
[02:25:00]  And I thought this was going to be my brush with fame.  I look in the mirror.  It's nobody but Anthony Cumia with a nice young lady in the passenger seat doing her makeup.  So I figured I'd wave as we make the turn onto the L.I.E., you know, maybe get a little  wave back.  But I hope he couldn't get past me fast enough.  Takes off like a jet.  Apparently, no regard whatsoever for his last ticket.  Oh, really? 
[02:25:30]  I kept it under 90.  Were you speeding all over Long Island?  I get applause from fans.  I don't think that was under 90, my friend.  Really?  Yeah.  I got to look.  Oh, no.  There was one point where it was about 110.  110?  Okay.  All right.  Two seconds after getting onto the L.I.E.  All right.  It's good to know you're slowing down a little bit.  Well, it was open, very open road.  Right.  So I might have...  When Jill's pregnant with your first kid, will you at least get it down to under 100 
[02:26:00]  when you're driving around?  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  Wow.  Absolutely, though.  He had a sighting there.  All right.  Let's go to Brad in Jersey.  Brad.  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  I just wanted to congratulate Anthony on the whole Jill Nicolini thing, because I'm  a huge fan of Jill, of course.  Who isn't?  Well, yeah.  Yeah, but, of course, you know, you got it made, too, because typically when you see  a hot chick with Jill, or a hot chick like Jill with a dude like yourself, they figure  he's either got a big hog or money, and you got both. 
[02:26:30]  So you're right here.  I got to agree with the guy.  Was she impressed with the big hog?  It was a tin knocker.  I think it would be a little rough for me to, you know...  Put it in my hair.  That's all I want to say.  Punch it out.  I mean, I'm his hero.  What did she say when she saw it?  That's not too personal.  I, uh...  I mean, it was this.  It was one of three things.  It was just a...  It was just a frightened sound, or was it...  Holy shit.  Something along that...  Holy shit.  Holy shit. 
[02:27:00]  What was it?  One of dread.  Ah, jeez.  Dread.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, no.  Oh, jeez.  It's kind of like when you get one of those big, huge sandwiches, you're like, well, I  got to figure out how to get this sandwich back.  I'll never finish this.  You got to pound it down a little bit.  But you're not giving the sandwich back.  You're all about...  No, no.  All right, I'll figure something out here.  Got to eat the sandwich. 
[02:27:30]  All right, let's get into some stuff.  Let's let me root.  Our guest wants to say something.  Oh, the decoupage.  The decoupage.  I'm an ugly piece of shit and a waste of time.  Oh, come on.  Oh, no, you're not.  Oh, decoupage.  I'm a big disappointment in the gift arena.  No.  No.  Don't sell yourself short, decoupage.  We've never given any of the other Opie and Anthony gifts a microphone.  That's right.  Decoupage.  Decoupage.  You just sit there and just relax.  Easy.  Something will, you know, come about.  There's a cock in the corner. 
[02:28:00]  There's a lot of cocks in this.  There's a lot of cock in there?  Yeah, there's a lot of cock when you start looking a little clay.  So now it's not half bad.  Well, that's the signature of the Pino's decoupage empire, is they will always have a cock in  the corner.  It's kind of like Hitchcock putting himself in his own movies.  Yeah.  This is corner cock.  Ah, yes.  The Pino's of Oregon.  Ah, yes.  The decoupage kings.  Could you get decoupage to say something else for our show there, Jimmy?  This is a very, very special treat for the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:28:30]  Don't talk to me.  I should be sawed in half.  No, you shouldn't.  No, why?  Why?  I'm a colossal waste of time and energy.  You're not.  Colossal.  I come looking like a friend of Black Sabbath picture, but instead I'm a bunch of stupid,  shitty pictures glued together.  No, no.  Somebody took a lot of time to make you.  They did.  Yeah.  And glue all those things on and find a wow and a danger. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  They should have found a match and some gas and burned me because while I am the world's  only talking decoupage, I am still worthless.  The world's only.  There might be one more talking decoupage out there.  No, there's not.  You sure?  The Pino's have created the one and only talking decoupage. 
[02:29:30]  I speak for all decoupages.  I say we suck and nobody enjoys looking at us.  Doesn't that make you kind of special, though, that you can talk?  Doesn't that make you...  Why am I looking at the decoupage?  Why am I looking at the decoupage?  Because you're an ass.  I'm talking to the fucking thing.  You certainly are.  And you're gesticulating to the decoupage.  I was using hand mannerisms to the decoupage. 
[02:30:00]  Jimmy's no better, though.  He's looking around and making sure no one knows that he's doing the old decoupage voice.  He is hiding his mouth.  You're hiding your mouth and you're looking like this.  What do you mean?  I'm trying to be quiet for the decoupage to speak.  Oh, yes.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Me.  Okay, decoupage.  Yeah.  Yeah, but because you can talk...  T.I.P. in the house.  Doesn't that make you special and worth something?  An amazing gift for Jimmy? 
[02:30:30]  Yes, it makes me worth sawing in half while I yell, ouch.  Can I have the scissors?  Because a decoupage, by any other name, is still a hunk of shit.  This thing is fucking lame.  I represent hours of wasted effort that could have been spent with his children.  This might not end well.  Oh, no.  Opie threw scissors at me.  It hit me, but they bounced off. 
[02:31:00]  Because I'm a well-made decoupage.  All right, decoupage, you sit there and enjoy the show.  When you've got something, you just speak up, okay?  Well, I don't have any choice but to sit here while I talk.  I don't have little decoupage legs, do I?  Imagine that, little decoupage legs.  Then I can throw myself into the garbage.  I can save Jim the time and everything.  I'm so sick of the word decoupage. 
[02:31:30]  Of course you are.  I don't want to hear it again.  I was sick of it after the first time I heard it.  All I want to say now, it would march itself into a trash can.  Of course it would.  And then just leap quietly face down, knowing what a piece of shit it is.  Of course, exactly.  It knows it's garbage.  It even looks like garbage.  Just a bunch of shit thrown onto a piece of wood, cardboard, whatever it is. 
[02:32:00]  It's like styrofoam, isn't it?  This is amazing radio, but I have to mention that somebody out there is getting married.  Who is it?  The decoupage.  Looks like I'm a wedding gift for one of these losers.  Get a mic out there.  I should get the shit beat out of me when the bill becomes a law guy.  I'm with you.  Matt Theo from New York writes, Opie, and this is for the married guy out there? 
[02:32:30]  Yes.  You're getting married?  Yeah, in a couple days.  All right.  Matt, you know him, Matt Theo?  Yeah, it's my brother.  All right.  Well, your brother writes, Opie, my brother's in studio.  He's getting married Saturday.  Opie, please make fun of him.  He looks like a piece of shit, and he's with my other brother with blonde hair that looks  like a piece of shit as well.  Piece of shit.  Yes, we're the piece of shit brothers.  And is the guy that wrote this a piece of shit, too?  Yeah, he's the biggest. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, you're getting married?  Yeah, Saturday.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Any story there, or are we just wasting time?  Don't you want to chime in, Anthony, about marriage and how I'm a fool?  Yeah, you're going for it, huh?  Wow.  How long have you known the young lady?  Three years.  Three years?  You lived together?  Uh, yes.  Yeah.  You lived together out on Long Island.  Mm-hmm.  And what made you decide that after three years, it's time to get married?  Uh, can't do much better.  I mean, she's a piece of ass, you know? 
[02:33:30]  Uh-huh.  You can't do much better.  You can't, that's a reason to get married.  You know what?  Anybody should say, because we are so deeply in love.  Yeah.  The first thing out of your mouth was, I can't do any better.  Yeah.  That is not the premise of marriage, or I think what...  She sounds wonderful.  Do you promise to love, honor, cherish, and always queef the national anthem?  I do.  I wonder if I did Reagan impressions, you know, then I would do a little better for myself.  Whoa! 
[02:34:00]  I think that was a backhanded insult.  Are you saying that every impression Anthony does has died?  No, they're all up to date.  You know, he's got some nice current ones.  He's just saying that if he could do impressions, he'd score a chick.  He would do a hell of a lot better than the one he's marrying Saturday.  I don't want to put words in your mouth, but that's how I see it.  Because it has nothing to do with my sparkling personality.  It's just my impressions.  Anthony's good.  I've seen Anthony work here.  Anthony's got...  You don't pull Nicolini just on fucking Reagan impressions. 
[02:34:30]  Thank you, Jimmy.  You've got to have money, cock, and charm.  That order?  What order?  It doesn't matter what order.  He's got...  You put them all together.  Oh, decoupage, yes.  Like a decoupage.  Oh, wow.  Money, cock, and charisma.  Decoupage.  That's what you are.  November, right?  Oh, go right ahead.  I didn't mean to continue talking.  Apparently, I'm getting married.  Piece of shit guy show.  Yeah.  Wow.  No, it's not November anymore because I blew it. 
[02:35:00]  I was trying to keep that a secret.  You can blow it.  I got some people scrambling for me right now.  Big wedding?  Yeah, out in the Hamptons.  I got a nice place.  Oh, nice.  If you need.  Very nice.  What kind of work do you do?  I'm a photographer.  Oh, okay.  For what?  Newspaper in New York.  For greater metropolitan newspaper?  What paper?  One of the big two.  All right, so it's either the Daily News or the Post.  Have you taken any good shots?  Are you?  A couple, yeah.  A couple big ones.  Cool.  Yeah.  Big ones.  What was your biggest picture?  I got a shot of Martha Stewart when she was in prison. 
[02:35:30]  That sold a lot of money.  Wow.  Wait, you're a pop?  What's that?  You're a pop?  Paparazzi?  Not really.  I'm a journalist, but, you know.  It's kind of like someone calling you a shock jock, I guess.  Are you a...  No, I didn't mean that as an insult.  So you shoot a lot of photographs for the paper, but some of them are paparazzi shots  because you just happen to be...  Yeah, because if it's newsworthy.  I got you.  You freelance or you work for the paper?  I work for the paper.  Oh.  Like, for instance, when you guys got in trouble, I'm sure there were photographers sitting outside 
[02:36:00]  your house.  Right.  No, no, not really.  So, you know, you don't always want to do it, but sometimes you got...  How much does a good photo sell for?  Tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands.  Like, what would be considered a real cool photo?  Like, a Martha Stewart picture.  I mean, what's that?  It could go for, like, you know, 30, 40.  Wow.  How much did it go for?  About 15, 20.  Wow.  Back then, a few years ago.  One shot, you made 15...  Well, it brought in 15, 20 Gs.  Yeah, it was the first one.  You got to get the first one, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah, obviously.  What's the big one right now everybody's trying to get? 
[02:36:30]  Is it somebody's kids?  The decoupage.  Well, the decoupage is really...  It's an impossible item.  Sam has the decoupage photo.  I think, probably, Long Island trash couple, Anthony Cumia and Jill Nicolini.  That would probably be a big one.  That's a big money photo right there.  Tens of dollars.  Tens of dollars?  Tens of dollars.  My God.  For Anthelini?  For the Long Island rubbish?  That's Long Island rubbish.  How much did you get for a photo of Hillary in a pair of shorts showing off those rounded 
[02:37:00]  butter sticks she calls legs?  How much money could you get for Hillary Clinton's clump?  Exactly.  Or her balls and dick.  What did you get for those?  Yeah, that's...  You do any celebrity stuff?  Have you gotten any, like, Britney shit like that?  Yeah, all that shit.  Yeah.  See a police scanner?  What?  Police scanner at home?  Do you have one that you listen to?  I mean...  Yeah, that's how I get, like, homicides and fires and stuff. 
[02:37:30]  I just listen to the scanner mic.  Oh, yeah?  What photo have you taken that you're proudest of?  I won some awards for some stuff I took in Virginia Tech recently that I'm pretty proud  of.  Oh, wow.  What did you take?  Graduation?  What was it?  No?  What happened?  And then, um...  Well, no.  What was the picture?  People want to know.  Oh, it was, um...  That's a biggie.  During the vigil when all the students were killed.  How horrific was that?  Yeah, and then, uh, it was tough.  Because, like, the first couple days was alright down there, but once they released  that guy's picture, they started to really turn on us. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  I was getting the finger every, you know, every time we turned around.  Oh, shit.  And then, uh, that, that, um...  I miss shooting.  That happened a while back.  Schoolhouse.  Schoolhouse.  I got some good stuff there, too.  What is the, uh...  What's one that you, you, you, you almost had?  Like, that was really good that you're like, fuck, someone else just got that after  I did or their picture was better, so they got it?  That's a good question.  Um, there's a lot of times it's just luck being in the right place at the right time,  you know?  Like, I get a lot of people jumping off buildings and stuff, and... 
[02:38:30]  Oh, yeah.  If I'm listening to, you know, if I'm listening to the scanner and, you know, these jumpers  go up on bridges all the time, you know, if I'm there, you know, click.  Can you bring some of your pictures in that they just won't publish because they're  too awful?  I got some gruesome stuff.  I can imagine.  Really?  Like what?  Yeah, head's being torn apart like that.  Hey, what's one that you think is, like, uh, overrated?  Is there any that got, like, a lot of press or a lot of, like, praise that you're like,  eh, that wasn't shit?  There's some hack stuff out there, like this guy who just gets naked people together and  takes pictures of them. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, I hate that guy.  I think that's kind of fucking stupid, you know?  I like, like, in-the-moment stuff, you know?  You know what was in bed?  That picture yesterday, that woman in the Hamptons that got arrested.  Oh, right, right.  That was pretty funny because, you know...  With her yelling and screaming at the camera guy?  Yeah, she kind of looks silly.  You know, she...  Remember the kid that got, uh, the NYU kid that got tackled?  The...  Oh, yeah.  Yep.  On the front of the bases?  Yeah.  That was a good photo, I thought.  Yeah, where he's kind of reaching out toward the base.  Yeah, so, like, that's why that made Front Page, because, you know, that photo.  What's your favorite photo of all time? 
[02:39:30]  Like, the one...  Did you look at a photo one day and go, fuck, that's what I want to do?  That's a tough one.  I mean, uh...  I'd have to say fucking Oswald getting shot is probably...  That's your greatest photo of all time.  ...one of the greatest photos ever taken.  Incidentally, the same guy that took that saw Oswald in the window the day before and  always regretted not taking that picture of Oswald up in the window.  Yeah, dummy.  You didn't know he was.  You thought he was just a fucking Secret Service agent.  Yeah.  And then he got that photo of Ruby killing him.  That moment is, like, everyone's face, it absolutely shows exactly what happened. 
[02:40:00]  Exactly what happened.  And that just moment didn't need any video or anything.  That is one of the greatest photos ever taken.  Yeah, amazing.  How about, was there one you had that's a favorite of yours?  I know, that's a tough question, but, like, one of the ones that you just admire tremendously?  Not yet.  You know, I've only been doing this for, like, five years, so I guess I'm still waiting  for, like, the real, real big one.  No, but I mean, not that you took.  Oh, that I've seen?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, like that, like, you look, as a comedian, I look at Pryor, so much of 
[02:40:30]  his work, and I go, ah, fuck me, man.  God damn it, he was wonderful.  Like, is there?  Of course, there's Iwo Jima, you know.  Yeah, that's a biggie.  There's, yeah, I guess I can't think right now of one offhand that inspires me, but.  Mr. Bildo from Detroit writes, Jesus, the Virginia Tech Vigilant Amish shooting, does  this guy's future wife know what a fucking ghoul he is?  Ghoul.  He's the greatest.  What does, uh, what does the young lady do? 
[02:41:00]  She teaches out in, uh, Center Reach.  Aw.  Oh, Center Reach.  What, uh, what grade?  Fifth grade.  Fifth grade?  Yeah.  Ever have sex with her students?  Jesus Christ.  I mean you.  Oh, no.  Fucking Kenny's undoing the, the packaging.  Ah, a brand new can opener for Jimmy.  I requested he get a new can opener because the other ones are apparently faulty.  Can, can, Jimmy.  They're not faulty, you don't know how to use them.  There's a third one.  Can you let Jimmy try to open it? 
[02:41:30]  This is a brand new can.  Brand new can opener.  I just want to see if it's the can opener or Jimmy.  Can I have a paper towel in, please?  This is, this is.  Thank you, sir.  Uh, good luck to you.  Congrats.  Yes.  Very good, sir.  Uh, we'll, we'll get back to you if, if, if we think of any other questions.  But Jimmy, Jimmy, this is the third can opener.  I love the Jimmy opening a can segment of the show.  Let's see.  You got to push down hard.  Here he goes.  All I'm doing, I'm fucking good.  Manly, this bing. 
[02:42:00]  Jimmy can't open cans.  I'm not meant to do this.  This is woman's work.  Here, bitch.  Open a can of tuna.  Mix me up a medley before I knock your teeth out.  That's how I get it done.  Mix me up a tuna salad and fetch the, fetch the rich crackers before you get a kick in  the cunt.  Oh, shit.  Hey, whore.  Why don't you whip me up a tuna surprise while I fuck your sister? 
[02:42:30]  Hey, open that tuna can so I don't think it's your pussy stinking up the living room.  That's right.  Get the can opener, and I don't mean my cock, if you know what I mean.  He has such trouble.  Oh, is it spinning now?  Oh, my God.  It's flipped over.  It's capsizing.  I don't know how to do this.  Yeah.  You got to squeeze hard.  This is a woman's work.  Let me do it. 
[02:43:00]  No.  Please.  Let me do it.  You're not a woman.  If I don't do it, I won't learn.  Here we are.  All right.  It is so frustrating to watch, because I just want to smack him and grab it away from him  and open that.  That's what I want you to do.  Believe me.  I am to fucking can opening what decoupages are to anything that doesn't suck.  We should have asked the photographer what he thought of the decoupage. 
[02:43:30]  I know.  As the decoupage sits in as a guest.  Hey, photographer.  You ever get a picture of a comedian taking a shit on a photomontage?  That'd be a good one.  I'd get you a Pulitzer.  A dookie-podge.  Get it, folks?  Oh, wordplay jokes.  We could smear, you know, some shit on it.  If I put it in a museum, I'm sure it'll do very well.  Oh, come on, Jimmy.  The fucking can opener is faulty.  Where did he go?  The third one. 
[02:44:00]  Exactly.  Because that new store, Ted's used can opener Emporium, and none of them are any good.  They were all given back because they're broken.  I told him to go somewhere else.  But he refuses.  Always trying to save a dollar.  Dude, you've got to squeeze really hard to begin with and poke that fucker through.  I know.  I'm busy.  A model rocket hobbyist sent a rocket up, and it appeared to be a UFO to a pilot.  Is that what happened?  All right.  You can't be shooting rockets at aircraft. 
[02:44:30]  I know.  Should we take a break here?  So where are we at with the tuna opening?  It's almost done.  I got about fucking three-quarters left.  Mother, this is really beginning to fucking bother me.  What's wrong with this?  It's so frustrating.  What?  What?  Nothing.  He doesn't squeeze hard enough, right, Thun?  No, it's how it's set up.  Exactly.  They're fucked up, right?  They're faulty.  The teeth aren't gripping.  No.  What?  Nothing. 
[02:45:00]  I'm doing it wrong.  Thun has given up on being helpful.  Have you noticed that?  Thun has just given up on being helpful to people.  I noticed that a year ago.  Those last days tomorrow, right, Thun?  That's right.  Tomorrow.  Why the fuck are you leaving midweek?  Because I have a trip planned.  Where are you going?  California.  California.  Hey.  Oh.  Nice.  Can we go on to some auditions?  Yes.  Well.  Is it just going up there, Thun?  There we go.  Boom.  Find myself.  Right.  Re-center.  You're going to walk the earth. 
[02:45:30]  Like Cain from Kung Fu.  Get an adventure.  Get an adventure.  I'll do it.  You're going to be a bum, Thun.  That's what they call people with no houses and no money.  They call them bums, Thun.  You're not joking.  Yeah.  I didn't even know what that movie is.  The old cash cow of amateur comedy.  It's coming my way.  Can you buy me one more fucking?  All right.  Kenny's going to attempt this.  He's like, I can't even know what he's doing either.  Oh, my God.  Look at him.  He has no idea.  Kenny will just take him in the back and beat it with a phone book. 
[02:46:00]  How did you do that?  Look at him go.  Look, it's all good now.  Oh, I know what I did wrong.  What?  I had a thing pointed the wrong way.  Exactly.  Not as easy as your thought, is it?  Yeah.  It's the can opener.  Get the fuck out of here.  Get a garbage can.  The third can.  Throw it at the decoupage.  You know what the difference is between a piano and a fish, Kenny?  No, Anthony.  What's the difference between a piano and a fish? 
[02:46:30]  You can tune a piano, but you can't tune a fish.  Oh, my God.  And Kenny laughs like a retard when she hears jokes like that.  I thought it was that pianos have keys and fish smells like pussy.  That was how I learned it when I was a lad.  When you were a little boy?  Yeah, that's what my dad told me.  What about the decoupage? 
[02:47:00]  What do you think?  The difference between a fish and a piano?  Yeah.  Uh, pianos don't swim.  Good one, decoupage.  Decoupage stinks.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Decoupage is innocent humor.  Yeah, we're going to continue with decoupage in just a bit.  Our guest decoupage.  Wait, decoupage, you want to stick around for a little longer, or do you got to go?  Yeah, you know what I would say about decoupages?  We love to just hang around. 
[02:47:30]  I hate the decoupage.  Oh, don't be such a hater.  Hey, thanks a lot for taking the lid off.  Now how am I supposed to drain the url with my fucking balls and asshole?  I like to fucking push the lid in and drain the url out.  The url.  Can you just put it on his head and let his hair soak it up?  Hey, tuna head.  Come on, I want to drain the fucking url and you took the lid off.  I know, put the lid back on.  Now I'll have to fucking, now I'll have to do the thing again. 
[02:48:00]  Why'd you put the lid on upside down?  It's not upside down, it's fine.  All right, should we take a break while you drain the url?  This is riveting stuff.  Fucking boy talks like decoupage and drains tuna can.  Ooh, look out serious.  Can't beat us, join us, huh?  You got to drain the url.  You got to drain the url out.  All right, we'll be back with decoupage.  Like a cyst.  I really believe this show is way above radio.  Put it on the table. 
[02:48:30]  Someone take the underwear.  Take the underwear.  Oh, God damn.  Oh, God.  It's like the underpants were dyed brown.  And those used to be white.  Way above other radio shows.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is Tippi Tom's Underpants Mustache.  Boy, that's bad news.  All right, I think we're ready here.  Oh, fuck.  No way.  No way.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, shit. 
[02:49:00]  Enjoy your hepatitis.  Pat fucking nothing.  Yeah, we're above radio.  Back with the show.  Hello.  I just turned on Decoupage's microphone.  I swear to God.  I had to turn it off.  What's wrong with you?  I want to thank that guy, the photographer, who was getting married Saturday for helping out the show today. 
[02:49:30]  And with that, I was handed a note by Than.  He writes, side note, you just officially spent more time on this guy's engagement than mine.  Thanks.  Wow.  We never talked about Than's engagement.  Well, we did just a little bit, a little bit, right?  All right.  Hey, we got a church banning an autistic kid.  Anybody want to hear a little joke?  Uh, sure.  Why not, uh, Decoupage?  Okay.  I, uh, I almost forgot what Decoupage sounded like and became Uncle Paul. 
[02:50:00]  Two Decoupages walk into a bar.  They own it.  Decoupage learned to quit while you're behind.  You can, uh, hear more about me at myspace.com slash Decoupage.  I don't know. 
[02:50:30]  Bombing?  Well, we don't expect much from a, from a piece of cardboard, so.  No.  I mean.  Bad pictures on it.  Right.  I'm starring in a play on Broadway called Dec, oof.  You do it.  Decoupage, I fool.  All right, listen.  Hey, can I ask one thing from the listeners?  Enough about the Decoupage. 
[02:51:00]  Right.  When I was in Cleveland, a couple of you wore Maxwell's, like a cunt shirt, and I took photos  or whatever.  Sure.  They showed up at the gigs.  You emailed them to me.  Can you please email me those photos again?  Because I lost them.  But I do want them.  The Maxwell's a cunt shirt that you had on at the Cleveland shows.  What are you going to do with them, Jimmy?  I don't know.  But I may have some interesting plans for them.  Ooh.  A book?  A CD?  Possibly book, yeah.  Maybe, uh, maybe, uh, something else.  Okay, uh, church bans autistic kid.  Listen to this story.  This, this is amazing. 
[02:51:30]  Raising a son with severe autism is not easy, but for the race family, church makes things  easier.  That's our strength.  That's how we get through all of this.  I know why they banned him.  Why?  Because obviously they thought his mind was the playground of the devil.  Get it?  I get it.  It's idle.  I love the get it.  Ta-da.  Oh, God.  All right, all right, hold on. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, I know.  I banned him.  The church was rather insensitive as to the reasons they gave.  Yeah.  They said, God couldn't and wouldn't do that to a good boy.  They said, your kid gives everyone the creeps.  They feel like he's a walking decoupage.  See that?  Right back in.  Bing.  Right back to the decoupage. 
[02:52:30]  The race family, church, makes things easier.  That's our strength.  That's how we get through all of this.  Just 13 years old, Adam Race is already six feet tall and 235 pounds.  Adam Race?  I want to be as funny as people say, Adam Race is a riot.  This kid's a monster.  He's 13 years old.  He's over six foot tall, over 235 pounds. 
[02:53:00]  Which makes things easier.  That's our strength.  You know what I always read about these people?  They hate, they hate, they hate, whenever he tries to make like a batch of, of, of cake  batter or something.  They just hate the way race mixes.  Oh my God, why are you, you're cracking yourself up today.  I know, I'm overtired.  I got an hour and a half of sleep last night.  Fucking.  Here we go.  Let's, let's see what this is all about.  Let's do all of this.  Just 13 years old, Adam Race is already six feet tall and 235 pounds, towering over Care 
[02:53:30]  11 reporter, Julianna Olson.  That size is a concern for his church, which was granted a temporary restraining order to  keep Adam out of mass.  Yeah, to get a restraining order.  Wow, to keep him out of church?  Keep him out of church.  Nice church.  We're doing the same thing.  We don't want him running around, knocking over gold statues.  Fuck him.  Leave him in purgatory.  It's all the difference. 
[02:54:00]  Holy good God.  This story is brought to you by 5-Hour Energy.  Yes, thank you to 5-Hour Energy for the free product.  You guys enjoying your 5-Hour Energy today?  Yeah.  This story brought to you by 24-Hour Oblivion.  They're hooking up the show with 5-Hour Energy, so make sure you grab some for home.  All right.  Back to the autistic kid who's been banned from church.  This fucking kid needs church.  What the fuck is wrong with the church?  The church says it was a last resort. 
[02:54:30]  In court papers, Reverend Daniel Walls argues Adam's behavior at mass is extremely disruptive  and dangerous.  He bolts unexpectedly from church and is nearly knocked over people, Walls says.  He spits and urinates, and when relatives try to restrain him, he fights and makes loud  noises.  Once, Walls says, Adam struck a child during mass, something his family does acknowledge.  It was one of those things where I was pushing him to go up to communion that morning.  I was wrong to do that.  I made a mistake. 
[02:55:00]  And Father Walls said, and I was trying to fuck the lad at the time.  I'll Terry punch him.  Communion.  They should put their hand out with a fucking Xanax in it.  Eat this, you big stoop.  Eat this, you fucking nuisance.  No one wants you.  No one wants you here.  Eat this and take a nap in a fucking confessional while we all worship.  Running up and down the pews, knocking down people's children. 
[02:55:30]  I don't blame the church in this case.  Can't have some fucking big lunk biting everybody and fucking throwing psalm books up in the air,  causing a big to-do.  It's not about you, douchebag.  It's about the hereafter.  It's about the Lord and eternity, not the here and now.  So beat it, stupid.  What a fucking blithering attention whore.  Jimmy, someone writes, how about when Adam goes fishing? 
[02:56:00]  He's a race baiter.  That's right.  I didn't even get that.  Oh, that's hilarious.  That's right.  They don't blame the church.  They're trying to conduct a, you know, and then Paul's letter to the Corinthians.  He bit me.  The stoop bit me.  And parishioners, remember, the Lord loves you. 
[02:56:30]  The Lord wants to keep you.  Could someone throw that retard out?  That lunk.  Tyler from Columbus writes, the problem is that the priest didn't want to touch someone who could fight back.  13.  He's building like fucking La Mata. 
[02:57:00]  These are the jewels from the belt.  You want to hear more about the autistic kid that's been from church or what?  Of course.  All right.  But they say Adam does not spit and the urination is incontinence.  Above all, they feel his behavior is improving.  They don't understand what's going in through Adam's mind when he behaves.  Exactly.  I'll tell you what.  A dust bunny is going through his mind. 
[02:57:30]  A fucking tumbleweed.  Who cares what's going through his mind?  Who's coming out of his mouth and his stick?  Nobody gives a shit about it.  And his shit up.  I don't care how dry his thoughts are.  The front of his pants are wet.  How about this?  How about this?  He thinks about piss, but doesn't do it.  He just reversed the options.  What's going through his mind?  I don't know.  Being in a pool?  A constant rainfall?  Fucking running water of some sort. 
[02:58:00]  Well, Chester's liver.  After he was tossed out of church, he became addicted to heroin.  And now he's covered in anyone?  Shit?  Racetracks.  Oh, well, racetrack.  Okay.  All right.  Here we go.  More about the autistic boy.  Improving.  They don't understand what's going in through Adam's mind when he behaves the way he does.  All they see are the externals. 
[02:58:30]  Carol was planning to divide you.  It's going on over his head.  This morning, he's eating birds.  That's right.  It's flying around his head along with stars and little planets.  Dolt.  Oh, that's hilarious.  They don't see beyond the hat with the power on us.  They only see the externals. 
[02:59:00]  You dumb bitch.  That's all anybody sees.  What do you think?  We look at each other's innards?  If they can only see my liver, you'd be dead.  He can't help but speak in tongues.  His mouth is full of one.  Shoddy Carpenter.  Very nice.  He wears an I'm with me shirt.  Let's go to Chris in Georgia.  Chris. 
[02:59:30]  Hey, good morning.  Father, why is the holy water yellow this morning?  Very good.  All right, let's go back here.  Carol was planning to defy the order this morning and take Adam back to St. Joseph.  But as she left her home, Todd County Sheriff warned her she would be arrested.  So today, she took her kids to another church.  But plans to keep fighting.  God created us.  He created us in his own image and likeness.  He also created fucking Tasmanian devils. 
[03:00:00]  You don't want to bring one into the church.  He also created fucking bee swarms and aids and shit.  You don't want to fucking throw them around the pews, do you?  Well, God created Wolverines, so I figured I'd throw one into the middle of the ceremony.  Fucking assholes, shut up.  God also created condoms and blowjobs.  He also created fucking rubber rooms and fucking medication and coat hangers. 
[03:00:30]  Holy shit.  Jimmy's crying.  I'm so bummer than anybody.  I'm out of my fucking mind here.  He's killing me.  Holy shit.  It makes perfect sense.  Just because God created the little fuckers.  Exactly.  I'd also create a fucking television once you watch the ceremony at home.  Just to keep fighting. 
[03:01:00]  God created us.  He created us in his own image and likeness.  Yeah, I'm sure that's what the fucking, the grand savior is like.  He's some fucking blithering fool just running around the universe breaking glass unicorns.  Oh, fuck.  Dickie Punchcock writes, Cain and unable.  Plans to keep fighting. 
[03:01:30]  God created us.  He created us in his own image and likeness.  Oh, wow.  Regardless of whatever our...  If he was in the Bible, it would be moe haircut, part of the Red Sea.  I had to go to the other church.  Our lady of giant retard who fucking pisses and shits himself.  Created us.  He created us in his own image and likeness. 
[03:02:00]  Regardless of whatever our abilities or disabilities are, we're all created with equal dignity.  Wow, Jimmy.  Hilarious.  Sean Bryant from Philly writes, hey guys, what happened to the animated podcast that were on iTunes?  I haven't seen a new one in weeks.  Has that stopped now, too?  Where are we at with the new animations on iTunes?  I know they're pretty much not working anymore.  Our Lady of the Immaculate Paint Chips. 
[03:02:30]  It's too fucking much.  You know, by the way, overhand me this book of all these great celebrity musical auction they're having at...  Hard Rock Cafe, I think?  Yeah.  Hard Rock Johnny gave us that?  They got some Beatles stuff, which is pretty interesting.  Right here, I want to get the...  I wonder how much they want for the...  Oh, my God.  For the...  For the...  The George...  The George Harrison hat with gutters. 
[03:03:00]  Your face is beet red.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  What the fuck is wrong with you?  What the fuck is wrong with you? 
[03:03:30]  Why is there pudding on me, pillow? 
[03:04:00]  He was always accused of a fucking Bill Cosby.  You don't seem to understand what's happening to you.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, my chest hurts.  I'm laughing too hard here.  I can't fucking...  I'm crying.  Going back to the autistic kid, Shay in Connecticut writes that he was...  The unwanted conception. 
[03:04:30]  Fuck.  What the hell?  Goddamn.  Fucking half with gutters.  I can't stop laughing thinking about that.  That's awful and hysterical.  Much better. 
[03:05:00]  Okay.  Tyler from Columbus.  He goes, from now on, Jim is only allowed 1.5 hours of sleep at night.  He's killing.  It's hysterical.  We got another terrific story.  Listen to this one.  Bride and groom in the hospital tonight after someone they didn't even know opened fire at their wedding.  Pope County Sheriff's officials say it happened near Dover, Arkansas, during a Creekside ceremony yesterday evening.  A Creekside? 
[03:05:30]  Creekside ceremony.  It's Arkansas.  Is this the type of wedding you and Jill are going to have, Ant?  Creekside?  A little Creekside wedding?  I don't think so.  Creekside.  Creep.  Creekside ceremony yesterday evening.  Boxing scene.  Sandra Kirk is live now near Dover with the latest on this very bizarre shooting at a wedding.  Sandra, what's happening?  Justin Kelly, right now the Pope County Sheriff's Department is trying to figure out why this happened.  A bride and a groom and two others gunned down at a wedding last night. 
[03:06:00]  And tonight, like you mentioned, the bride and groom remain in the hospital.  We're told this man, 29-year-old Patrick Duvall, now behind bars after deputies say Duvall shot at the wedding party with a semi-automatic pistol,  then took off in a stolen truck.  We're told he was later arrested and he is expected to see a judge first thing Wednesday morning.  Okay.  All right.  That's pretty creepy. 
[03:06:30]  I thought there was more to it.  Yeah, it's definitely creepy.  Trying to get married.  Sure.  I don't know.  I'd have to see the principals involved.  I'd have to see that newscast.  Maybe anyone got pictures?  I'd have to see that, see what was going on.  People are guessing the wedding song, Shotgun Blues, Hit Me With Your Best Shot, or something  by 38 Special. 
[03:07:00]  Some people get all the luck.  All right.  I've been saving this for a day like today.  There's Nothing Wrong With Buggering Boys, a satirical song.  Satirical.  I know.  Satirical.  I like to say a satirical song done by Jonathan King, a British singer-songwriter who was convicted  of sexual offenses against a 14 and 15-year-old.  Ooh.  So, he's convicted of the crime and decided he needed to sing a song called There's Nothing 
[03:07:30]  Wrong With Buggering Boys.  You want to hear this today?  Oh, certainly.  All right.  And here we go.  You've got to have consent, clear understanding what is meant, but if they don't regard it  bent, they may well discover it was heaven sent.  There's nothing wrong with buggering boys as long as he's doing what he enjoys. 
[03:08:00]  Oh, my God.  That's like Nambla's philosophy.  You know a little bit about this song there, Sam?  I bet Sam does.  He's the boy they're talking about.  No.  Yes.  Buggering boys.  No, apparently this guy is like, I guess he's working on putting together some kind of  musical, so this is supposed to be satirical.  You can bend over and start to blow as he looks down with his big afro. 
[03:08:30]  It's not the words.  No?  No.  I thought I heard that line.  No.  It's your cherubish cheeks.  No.  All four of them.  All red.  Red and sore.  All right, A.  All right, A.  All right, A. 
[03:09:00]  All right, A.  All right, A.  All right, A.  All right, A.  All right, A.  All right.  All right, A. 
[03:09:30]  All right.  All right, A.  All right.  dicks in their ass.  Like, as long as you're doing what he enjoys, yeah.  Stick my hog in your ass.  I think only one out of the two are enjoying.  Let's take a picture  to remember  the day I fucked in the ass.  The day  we spilled the paint. 
[03:10:00]  The day I spilled  my sperm in your ass.  My seed.  What is that?  This the guy?  What a creep.  What a girl.  It's a musical club.  The Greeks  and smiles of its style.  Oh, the Greeks.  And Mika and Jawa's beguiled.  Don't let 
[03:10:30]  its glory be defiled.  If you  share the laughing,  it can drive you wild.  There's nothing going  to get stuck in your head.  Don't get it.  Yeah.  Sing it on the subway.  What?  Sing it on the subway.  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  It's like the Ho. 
[03:11:00]  It was a duet with Pete Townsend.  Yeah.  Oh.  Nothing wrong.  Well, there's nothing wrong.  There you go.  As long as he's doing what he enjoys.  Right.  Bleeding from his rectum.  That's wonderful.  It's a nice song.  Mm-hmm.  Moving through our stuff today.  Cleaning house.  Yeah.  A lot of this stuff is piled up.  Good.  I like it. 
[03:11:30]  You like this?  Yeah.  I like the cleaning house segment.  Yeah.  We do this from time to time.  So is this the guy from the commercials?  Buggering boys.  You guys know the commercial about LifeLock and that douche arm?  Oh, yeah.  Gives out his social security number.  He goes, hey, I don't care about identity theft.  No one's going to get my identity.  Here's my social security number.  Do you hear what happened?  Trucks are going around with advertisements on the side that have his social security number.  Oh, really?  Blown up.  They're like five feet high.  The letters.  You can't.  Letters.  The numbers.  If you listen to this channel, you've heard the spots. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  The guy's all cocky and stuff.  Look, hey, you know.  Here's my social security number.  Good luck to you.  Yeah.  Well, guess what?  Well, for two years, Todd Davis has dared identity thieves to steal his ID.  And it looks like somebody got the man who runs LifeLock, the pitch man for the Tempe-based fraud prevention company, reportedly is a fraud victim.  Davis says somebody successfully used his social security number to obtain a payday loan of 500 bucks.  Davis gives out his actual social security number in LifeLock commercials and says the gimmick has led to a total of 87 attempts to use it. 
[03:12:30]  Several customers claim the service does not provide the protection it promises and have actually filed suit against the company.  Oh, this guy is done.  What a dope.  Yeah.  I saw a commercial for it recently.  And they said LifeLock prevents your number from being stolen.  If we can't stop it, we'll fix it. 
[03:13:00]  I don't know if they just added that, but it's almost like they're saying if someone gets out, we'll take care of it.  And they amended it again after that, where they said, we don't think they can, but try to keep your number under your head.  Under your head.  I think they said something like that, like, between you, me, and the gate post, we think it'll be all right.  But if not, what can we tell you?  Yeah.  What'd you expect? 
[03:13:30]  You're giving out your social security number.  Well, for helpful hints, actually, on how to not get identity theft, they say two things not to do with your social security number.  One, don't put it on TV or on a giant truck that rides around the city.  They said there are two little things you might want to be careful of.  It would tempt some folks, don't you think?  What an idiot.  This business is done.  Done.  They also say that you shouldn't make a decoupage with your social security number on it and put it all over town. 
[03:14:00]  I didn't even realize decoupage was still doing the show with us today.  Yeah, it's hard to get up this early.  Yeah, I see that.  Yeah, decoupage.  I had a busy weekend.  You seem a little flat today.  I also ran out of steam an hour ago.  I hate decoupage.  Don't mess with decoupage.  Ow!  Ow!  Decoupage now has a hammer in it.  There's a hammer in the middle of decoupage.  I hate decoupage.  Call an art gallery.  I think you created something. 
[03:14:30]  Now it means something.  Look, that's something right there.  We don't know what, but it's something.  I put the claw part right through the chick's skull.  Well, when decoupage left house this morning, I said, I hope I get nailed.  I hate decoupage's jokes.  Decoupage is funny.  He likes puns.  If leaking from his mud valve is what he enjoys, there's nothing wrong.  That's Les from Chicago, going back to the buggering song. 
[03:15:00]  Should we continue with the cleanup?  Yeah.  All righty.  We got prom season.  Oh.  And you got this girl.  She wants to bring her gay friend to the prom at a dress.  That's probably not going over well.  Where are they?  Part of the country.  Over there.  I've always kind of been drawn to a very unique and independent thinking community.  When it comes to the senior prom at Peabody Veterans Memorial High School, Debra's...  Peabody?  This is Massachusetts. 
[03:15:30]  Peabody Mass.  This is a Massachusetts story.  What's the story now?  What's going on here?  Well, Jimmy, there's a girl wants to bring her gay friend to the prom at a dress.  I've always kind of been drawn to a very unique and independent thinking community.  When it comes to the senior prom at Peabody Veterans Memorial High School, Debra's plans  are certainly not the norm.  Due to complications with my boyfriend being far away, I decided I wanted to bring a gay  guy friend to prom with me.  But the 17-year-old didn't stop there. 
[03:16:00]  And he's, like, skinnier than I am, so I'm sure this will fit him.  That's right.  She said him.  The guy she tries to bring to the prom wants to dress in drag.  And then she said, she didn't go over very well with her principal.  You hear that?  Didn't go over too well.  Too well.  Too well.  With the principal.  I've always been drawn to attention-seeking fruits.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is just about getting some attention.  Of course it is.  I mean, you know, just stop it already.  Wow.  After a while, Goose chased them. 
[03:16:30]  This morning, my principal said, can't do it.  Absolutely not.  No.  That's what Debra called.  What?  What?  What?  Oh, my God.  Get us out of Iraq.  CNN.  Change by war.  Husband cares for wounded wife.  It's a husband and the wife, and she's missing both arms.  Obviously, probably some IED explosion.  But they're both blown off, like, above the elbow.  Holy shit.  I honestly don't know if I could stay with somebody.  I mean, I know that's really shallow.  I always admire the spouses of people who are injured.  What are we up to?  4,100 dead. 
[03:17:00]  I know we're over.  God damn.  4,100 dead.  Over 30,000 wounded so far.  Both fucking arms.  How the fuck do you itch?  How do you do anything?  I know.  Ugh.  God, that sucks.  Both arms.  Especially when you're not born that way.  You know what it's like.  Yeah, I think about that.  Holy shit.  Is that going to be born that way?  There's aliens out there that have, like, four eyes, and they look at us like, how the fuck  do they even live with two eyes?  But see, we don't know any better, so we live with the two eyes. 
[03:17:30]  Right.  Right?  Or four arms.  That's how it works with some of these people that are born blind.  They don't know what they're missing.  Hmm.  I guarantee they don't know what they're missing.  They're probably seeing stuff that we don't see.  Yeah.  Because their other senses get more acute.  Oh.  Hmm.  Fox 25, and we called the superintendent, who says Debra's date will be allowed to attend  the prom.  Oh, thank God.  The student handbook says everybody must wear appropriate attire, and a dress is considered 
[03:18:00]  appropriate.  Oh, wow.  Relieved, excited, two thumbs up.  I'm just really excited.  I can't wait to go with my friend now.  Debra was frustrated with the principal's initial decision, but when it comes to the superintendent...  He's my man.  Well, your date certainly isn't.  What our date ought to wear is two sandwich boards of his father crying in different rooms  in the house.  Fucking asshole.  How about a robe? 
[03:18:30]  Exactly.  I'm wearing a robe and stirring broth.  You should wear a poodle and a fucking gathering of sad friends.  Fucking tool.  Wears a dress.  Wow, that guy really is a free thinker.  That's good, yeah.  He'd be a free thinker if he wore a Metallica shirt and then blew someone on this fucking...  Blew someone fucking behind the dumpster and just kind of kept it quiet.  That's a free thinker.  Guy that wears a tux and dresses like a gentleman, but then eats the ass of a fucking student teacher.  A male.  He eats Mr. Rupert's anus behind the fucking... 
[03:19:00]  Behind those fold-out gym...  Whatever they called.  The bleachers.  The bleachers, yeah.  He eats the ass of a mustachioed student teacher, but he's wearing a fucking tuxedo.  Mustachio?  That's a free thinker.  Some fucking...  Some gay guy wearing a dress.  Who gives a turkey?  You want to be a free thinker?  Yeah.  What the fuck are you doing? 
[03:19:30]  What are you spraying on your feet?  What?  What are you spraying on your feet?  That's next time.  Ugh.  I'll catch you spraying Skeeter repellent on your feet again.  Desinex.  What the fuck is going on?  Dude, what's going on with your fucking paws?  What do you do for fun?  Moonwalk barefoot on the fucking gym floor?  Jesus, your feet have AIDS.  How did that happen?  Hey, fucking...  Hope he's a fucking fire walker on the weekends. 
[03:20:00]  Old turtle...  At the circus.  Old turtle tootsies.  How much Desinex do you need?  Yeah, really?  What the fuck?  You drenched them.  Oh, man.  All right, one to go.  What happened?  I don't know.  It's a good question.  I wore the same socks two days in a row.  Oh, see.  What do you do on the weekends?  Keep your feet in the closet and grow shrooms?  Actually, the same underwear for two days, though. 
[03:20:30]  I was lazy.  He's wearing humidors, his shoes.  Oh, man.  That feels much better.  Athlete's foot, huh?  Do we want to continue?  Of course we do.  Cleaning house.  You've never had athlete's foot?  I have never had athlete's foot in my life.  You've never had a foot thing on your foot?  Because I never took a shower in, like, a gym.  I just don't.  I'm going home.  Shower at fucking home.  I got to stand in that goddamn Petri dish. 
[03:21:00]  You can get them just from working out, though.  Just from being...  I get them, too.  My feet itch a lot.  How?  You got your socks and sneakers on.  There's sweat in there.  My foot doctor told me because I...  Yeah, but then you get home, you take your fucking shoes and socks off immediately.  Yeah, I do the same.  You hop in the shower.  It doesn't matter.  Cleanliness is next to godliness.  Yeah, is this...  How about another pedo pop song?  All right.  I love the girls. 
[03:21:30]  All right.  By who, Danny?  This was...  Anthony Cumia.  This was found by Laszlo.  Yeah, Laszlo found this one.  He...  It was actually a...  Some...  Some awful country somewhere was holding some contest to write a song.  And I forget the guy's name.  I'll have to look it up again.  But he entered this in this contest.  And it was actually up on the site where you could vote for it until they decided that  it was inappropriate and they took it down.  How much does Laszlo look like Lance from Pulp Fiction?  A lot.  He looks like Kid Rock even more, though. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah, a little Kid Rock, a little Lance from Pulp Fiction.  Definitely.  Did we play this already?  No, I don't think so.  Sounds familiar already.  What?  Is it in your iPod, faggot?  I love it already.  I love the girl.  What a creepy song already. 
[03:22:30]  I love it.  One of my submarines is missing.  I love the girl.  Yeah.  I love the genius song.  All right.  What the fuck?  Wow, this guy's a creep.  Well, who knows?  Let's give him a chance.  I like this kid.  See what he loves about him.  Maybe he loves teaching.  Maybe he loves, you know, helping them out with the Girl Scouts.  Nothing good could be next.  Oh, 13 years old. 
[03:23:00]  And nothing else, baby.  I love the girls.  Oh, 13 years old.  13 years old.  And nothing else, baby.  Oh, they have gone.  Oh, yes. 
[03:23:30]  Well, Matt in Philly.  Matt writes, shut the fuck up.  We 4,100 dead and keeping this country safe, asshole.  We lost 3,000 one day.  Dickhead.  Take your fucking pick.  The military or the people.  Can't have it both ways.  All right.  Opa's right.  And that fucking person right again is a reactionary douche.  Are you fucking kidding me?  What are they protecting us against?  Exactly.  Explain that one to me.  We could have carpet bombed and lost no one, silly goose. 
[03:24:00]  There you go.  I'm not against, you know, kicking a little ass, but let's do it from fucking 30,000 feet  with some B-52s.  Exactly.  Stop being nice and trying to avoid mosques.  Yeah.  Fuck that.  Empty the mother load on them.  Yeah.  There you go.  That'll shut them up.  There.  Pipe up again to get some more of this.  Maybe Matt doesn't have anyone.  Maybe Matt doesn't have anyone over there that is hoping they come back safely and wondering  why your loved ones are over there.  For what exact fucking reason? 
[03:24:30]  My love, the girl.  Fucking douche.  Fucking Matt, maybe he needs to sit down and look at a decoupage of all the things we  have to be grateful for.  Fuck that decoupage.  Oh yeah, I forgot. 
[03:25:00]  What the fuck?  This is XM, my friend.  What's he going to do?  What was bleak?  Fuck them in their ass?  Oh man.  I had to beep it for stupid CBS and I can't remember what it was. 
[03:25:30]  Oh no.  The XMers are going to kill you.  I'll pop up the lyrics real quick.  I think it's fuck her in the ass.  That's what I'm going to guess.  Go back again.  I think I, let's see what it is.  Hold on.  Let's try to figure it out.  You can play a game.  You can play a game.  That's the answer for everything.  Danny came up with a new game.  Just play a game.  All right, we'll play a game.  They put the rocks around me and I'm going.  Now I say they want to. 
[03:26:00]  I know what it is.  Yeah.  And I take them decoupage shopping.  Enough about the decoupage.  Now I know they like that.  All that I can feel.  Nobody set me free.  All I understand.  My dreams will never end. 
[03:26:30]  I love the girls of 13 years old, 13 years old, and nothing else, my baby.  I love the girls of 13 years old, 13 years old, and nothing else, my baby.  I am ever-losing boy, ever-losing boy. 
[03:27:00]  I am ever-lasting boy.  Ever-lasting boy.  I love the girls of 13 years old 
[03:27:30]  13 years old and nothing else me baby  I love the girls of 13 years old  13 years old and nothing else me baby  Mongo the choker is saying, is anyone else jerking off to this song? 
[03:28:00]  I actually like that.  It's a bit catchy, right?  It really is.  I love the girls of 13 years old and nothing else me baby  I love a girl  What language?  It sounds German  It sounds like a cool accent  No, it was some terrible third world country  Oh yeah  Like nana, 1999  I think it was like serbia  That's funny 
[03:28:30]  That's funny.  I love cleansing the 13-year-old girls ethnically.  Get it?  I found out what I had to beep out, by the way.  Oh, what was it?  It was they put their arms around me, and I'm going down, down, down.  Really?  That was it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I thought it was a little more.  Oh, I'm going down, down, down.  Does that mean he's, but if their arms are around him, what's he doing?  He arms around him, and he wants to go and lick some snatch. 
[03:29:00]  Can I have a copy of that?  I started going, I went down to my fucking iPhone.  I love the girls.  They're 13 years old.  It's like doing a child.  If you were a man and a pedophile.  I love the girls.  But you arranged those harmonies so nicely.  That's very nice.  Terrific.  I might need that.  Who's the Laszlo lookalike up there?  That was my nomination.  Wow.  Who is that?  That's my nomination for people that look like Laszlo.  No, no, that's close, but pop up. 
[03:29:30]  Who is that again?  Pop-up Lance from Pulp Fiction.  That's Steve the Pirate from Dodgeball.  Yeah, Steve the Pirate from Dodgeball.  That's right.  And then pop up Lance.  What's his, Stokes, right?  Yeah, but you've got to have him as Lance, definitely.  You know, if you put him up there from Mask, it's not really going to be appropriate.  What's his, Eric?  Lance.  Eric Stoltz.  Eric Stoltz.  Stoltz.  You could just put Pulp Fiction Lance, right?  All right.  What's the matter with you?  Lance, a bunch of boils are showing up.  Jousting. 
[03:30:00]  I had to.  You heard me.  She's dying on me, Lance.  Can we find him?  Oh, yeah.  Give it a shot.  There he is.  That's great.  He's eating his cereal.  I think the other guy's got him beat, though, I'm going to be honest.  Yeah?  Yeah, the other guy.  I don't know.  The other guy has a weaker chin.  Like, I love Laszlo.  But his fucking chin is like a fucking, it's like a baby knuckle.  And Kid Rock is another one.  Is he a contender for our Laszlo look-alike contest we're having right now? 
[03:30:30]  Of course.  Because someone's saying this is the greatest ADD show we've done in a long time.  That's a bad one.  That's a bad one.  Wow.  Hey, Matt from Philly wrote back.  What?  In all fairness, I want to read what Matt from Philly writes.  He says, Opie, my point is that if we were not in this war, we would have been hit a few  times in the last seven years.  Really?  That's some fucking praise for Bush, for once, for keeping us safe. 
[03:31:00]  Same old liberal shit from day to day.  This war keeps them away from us.  You know what, dude?  It really doesn't, sir.  I'd send as many people as you could into Afghanistan.  That sounds sound and reasonable.  Iraq, though?  How is that?  Yeah.  Saddam had those people fucking taken care of.  Absolutely.  He knew how to deal with them.  And we had the UN sanctions against them, kept them from flying planes, kept them from  researching things.  We had inspectors in there. 
[03:31:30]  We were overflying the fucking country the entire time.  How did sending troops to Iraq make us safer?  I understand Afghanistan.  Don't get me wrong.  I loved to pour more fucking troops into there.  But how did sending them to Iraq help?  And stop with the liberal nonsense.  I know.  I'm hardly a liberal, you fucking dumbbell.  I'm hardly a liberal.  I'm more liberal every day, Jim.  Bush is a douche.  Yeah, he is a tool.  George Bush is a douche president.  Sorry.  I'm not a liberal. 
[03:32:00]  I'm the furthest thing from it.  I'm a fucking Republican.  You're not even a fascist.  I'm voting for somebody.  Yeah, I know.  Who are you telling that to?  The people that just woke up from a coma?  I know.  I'm telling them to that douchebag.  I'm voting Republican.  But how do you not look at George W. Bush and not think the guy's a complete douchebag?  That's right, Matt.  He hasn't done anything for this fucking country.  Saddam.  He sat in there.  The war has been his entire fucking presidency.  That's right.  Oh, enough.  Saddam had all those people figured out, like you said. 
[03:32:30]  And it was a balancing act between all the...  No one was fucking around.  You'd fuck around.  He'd have his sons go over there and rape your fucking wife and shoot you in the head.  And throw you the fucking lions.  Yeah.  Saddam, as we say, didn't fuck around.  That's why Iraq was all ship-shape and tidy.  That's right.  Until we showed up with our fucking...  Talk about liberal.  With our liberal ideas about voting and all this nonsense.  Democracy for them.  That's the liberal part of it.  Let's force-feed our fucking will through big government on somebody else. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah.  That's a very liberal ideology.  You goose-a-baloo-sa.  Pardon my French.  There you go.  If Matt agrees with the effort, why doesn't he go over there?  That's right, Matt.  What are you doing besides laying in front of people's doors?  It doesn't go over there if you believe in it, man.  That's a tough situation for a lot of people.  Over 30,000 wounded.  I was talking to someone about the war the other day.  They said you watch the suicide rates start happening now, too.  Well, they say that that's happening already. 
[03:33:30]  That's going to get out of control.  You're not going to want to live the rest of your life with two lack of arms.  That's probably a better way to say that.  Two lack of arms?  That's why I laughed halfway through it.  Armless.  Lack of arms.  You don't want to live your life with a complete lack of arms.  Right.  You know what?  Oh, I love the war.  All right.  Well, now Matt's back.  Matt, call us up.  You know what this show's about.  You want the instant feedback?  What did he write again? 
[03:34:00]  Maybe he's at work and he can't.  He writes, it was the staging point for the war.  I'm not talking about you, Ant.  I'm speaking to Jim and Opie.  Bush is not that bad of a guy.  Shut up, Matt.  I was for Bush for all these years, you fucking idiot.  I defended him on Tough Crowd and everything.  And I defended the decision to go.  He's saying we're going to realize how good he was after he's out of control.  Yeah, aren't we?  You get it and we don't, right?  You're the real reader.  Come on.  Don't be naive, stupid.  His legacy is going to amaze us all.  Yeah, really amaze.  I watched the entire...  He had the highest fucking approval rating, I believe, of any president ever after 9-11. 
[03:34:30]  Oh, yeah.  And people were complaining.  People were complaining because he wasn't doing anything.  He was signing legislation.  They should...  Remember that?  With the...  With the...  Whatever.  The strike of a pen or however he phrased it.  People were like, go to Afghanistan already.  He wasn't doing anything.  Yeah.  So we were being impatient and he finally went to Afghanistan.  And that's...  And then the left piped up then and they were wrong to pipe up.  And that's what we ought to do.  Afghanistan.  That's where the bad guys were.  Yeah.  Al-Qaeda, the Taliban.  Absolutely. 
[03:35:00]  You think Al-Qaeda was fucking around in Iraq?  They hated...  They hated...  Oh, my God.  It's that Dom would have fucking taken care of them, lickety-split.  They think he's an infidel.  Oh, God.  Opie.  Opie's firing retro rockets.  Yeah.  What the hell is this?  I know.  We don't care if we don't get gimbal lock on your fucking...  Gimbal lock.  Sorry.  No.  I got some...  I got prescription stuff.  I don't play games with fucking Desinex.  Desinex is a child's play.  What do you use for your jock itch? 
[03:35:30]  You got jock itch?  Raid.  Every once in a while.  Every once in a while.  I'll throw some Desinex in there.  Yeah?  Yeah, what the fuck?  When you rub your hand between your fingers, between your sack and your leg, and it comes  up a little gamey.  It comes up a bit flaky.  It comes up a bit flaky.  Do you ever get flaky?  No.  Not at all.  Holy shit.  What do you wash your balls with?  Pie crust?  God damn.  I wash in there like a surgeon scrubbing up.  I wash.  Believe me.  Trust me, I wash.  No fucking chafing in there. 
[03:36:00]  Me neither.  I wash.  It's going to be nice.  I take a handful of fucking lava soap.  I wash my balls so good.  What I do is I take like a...  I dampen my hand a little.  Yeah.  And then I rub it in Ajax and I scrub that all over my cock balls.  And down to my asshole.  And then I put my shorts on.  And I head out for the day.  I know.  You don't rinse?  You just leave the Ajax up your ass?  This way if I sweat, it's like it's automatically washing my balls and ass.  My body becomes an efficient dishwasher. 
[03:36:30]  Like a lot of times I'll even smush Ajax into my anus with a plunger handle.  This way when I shit, I'm cleaning my ass at the same time.  People wonder why I'll shit without paper.  And I'll just stand up and go, ta-da!  And then pull my trousers off.  Let's say hi to Oliver in St. Louis after that lovely description.  Oliver, what's up?  Hi, Oliver.  What's up, Brian?  Sorry about your home life.  Oh, man.  That's a stupid joke. 
[03:37:00]  What's up, Oliver?  You know what Bush did?  Other than bringing a $4 gas price and killing the economy for a small businessman like me,  he brought weed up to $60 an aid.  Yeah.  You can't get cheap weed.  You can't get cheap gas.  We're heading for a recession.  He's just amazing.  The scumbags in Saudi Arabia won't lower the oil.  It won't increase oil production or whatever.  And he's holding hands with them in a garden.  Why don't you stop with the hand-holding?  Why don't you cut that malarkey out, bub?  Enough with the hand-holding with these fucking savages that are just fucking raping us for oil. 
[03:37:30]  We're being raped for oil.  Let's say hi to Bill in Cleveland.  This is fair.  I mean, the guy did two tours in Iraq.  Bill, what do you got on the issue here?  Well, I wanted to tell the guy, man, you should shut the fuck up.  Because until he experiences two tours and not sleeping and having to see a fucking psychiatrist ever since I got back,  he has no opinion.  He has no right to criticize anything.  Exactly.  I know, Matt, talking about liberal nonsense, you fucking, maybe Matt was an ex-soldier or whatever he was, 
[03:38:00]  but it's like, I went over there, you fucking asshole, and I'd love to go back.  I want to go back.  He's not an ex-soldier.  If he was an ex-soldier, he wouldn't have those kind of criticisms toward Bush.  You know, love him or hate him, we would have been attacked probably about six or seven more times if we didn't go over there.  Oh, he's yelling at Opie?  Who's he yelling at?  No, I'm just saying, guys.  Hey, Bill, look, I'm just a dope with a microphone.  Hold on, wait.  I want to ask Bill one question.  Bill, you went there two tours of duty.  Was it worth it?  Do you know why we're there?  Well, yeah, it's worth it to me to, Bill, have my family exercise their freedoms without, you know, 
[03:38:30]  having to wear a fucking berk over their head or something.  Bill, we agree with that, but that's not what the threat was.  Well, of course we agree with that, but Saddam staying in power, to me, it's just,  it's the American military being misused when they could have been more effective in dealing with terrorism in other places.  Nobody wants America, to me, protecting freedom, nobody was going to march in here and put burkers on Americans.  Well, that's understandable, but, you know, I did it because I volunteered. 
[03:39:00]  I wanted to go.  I wanted to defend the freedom of my country and whoever else, you know, I don't know.  I'm trying to, like, find the words for this crap.  Well, the thing, dude.  It just pisses me off.  It makes me upset that people criticize something that they don't have any experience in.  They don't know what it's like.  But, Bill, you don't have to have experience to disagree.  Like, I was for it.  I went over there to support soldiers and troops and perform, you know.  But now, the more I've learned about it, in hindsight, the more you realize that the information was incorrect,  the more I hate seeing fucking soldiers get injured and killed defending Iraqi people. 
[03:39:30]  I don't care about them, okay?  If they were in the hills of Afghanistan or in Pakistan, if they were able to get into those tribal regions and they were gunning everybody,  I'm all for that.  But, to me, Iraq is just not what the problem was.  And I hate to say that, but that's, to me, any soldier being killed trying to free Iraqis from oppression should not be killed because I don't care if they're oppressed.  I care about American lives. 
[03:40:00]  I don't care about the Iraqis.  Well, we're not all the way hated.  Some people hate us.  Like, you know, I think about 40% of them hate us.  But a lot of the other 60% are, like, really glad we're over there.  Dude, if they were having a civil war and they asked for aid to overthrow Saddam and the Americans aided them in their civil war, like, I believe, or whatever, or their revolution, I would be for that.  But, to me, we went over there thinking that we were going to find these things that were a possible threat to our security. 
[03:40:30]  Turns out they weren't there and they switched the reason.  And I'm arguing against points I argue.  I mean, I was the invasion force when we first went over there in 03.  I was the first wave of the people who, like, invaded the city when we first started this nightmare.  Bill, would you have felt the same way if they said, out of the blue, we're going over there to just free the Iraqi people?  And if you knew about the religious hatred they have for each other and the fact that you weren't going to be able to hit mosques and yet they were going to send suicide bombers into mosques and all that, and Al-Zar Qayyar was going to be head contractors. 
[03:41:00]  If you knew what you know now, would you have felt the same going over there?  Yeah, and I wouldn't have let the mosque thing stop me.  I'd still throw a grenade into it.  All right, but I mean, would you have felt the same just freeing the Iraqi people?  Yeah.  Okay.  I believe everybody should have free thought, not sit there and be oppressed by some country or some government.  I agree, but I think they have to kind of want it.  Yep.  Well, there's 60% that do want it, and there's the other 40% who have lived all their lives under this stiff regime. 
[03:41:30]  If you say the wrong thing, you die.  Why didn't they pick up arms and start their own fucking revolution?  And against Saddam and the bath party instead of just lollygagging around.  Well, they were scared.  They needed a little bit of courage.  Yeah, well, let me tell you, I'm sure the original 13 colonies, the people there were a little scared, too, to fight the British. 
[03:42:00]  But they did it, and, you know, that's how you win your freedom, because you want it so bad that you're willing to fight and die for it.  And those people, they don't deserve to be free, because they weren't at a point where they wanted freedom that badly.  And now it's our fucking responsibility, and by our, I don't mean me, I mean, you know, you guys.  Okay, why is there a good solution?  Why don't we just agree to disagree?  All right.  But the point is, though, there's so many people oppressed. 
[03:42:30]  It is 1050?  That sounds good to me.  I don't like to agree to disagree.  Sure.  How come the U.S. military right now is not in Africa or the Sudan, in the Congo?  Because those people are black, too.  Where all these barbaric crimes are being committed.  Genocide.  Yeah.  On a global level.  We're not stopping that.  We could.  We could.  These band of, I mean, we could absolutely stop that.  If the military went full force and tried to help those people, we absolutely could stop it.  We know that. 
[03:43:00]  We're not going to stop right now.  Our resources are so, like, ridiculously stretched.  Like, we're fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq.  Okay, well, then why aren't we trying to overthrow Musharov?  I believe that's the military dictatorship, and I believe the people don't like him.  And how come we're not overthrowing, I think it's the House of Saud, because they're our allies, of course, but the people hate them.  Well, if I knew that, you know, I would be able to tell you, but I'm not chain of command.  I'm not a high-ranking commander like the rest of them are.  They sit behind the desk, give out orders. 
[03:43:30]  We have to go undo them.  Yeah, they make bad decisions, dude.  They give us this amazing military we have, and then they tie your hands behind your back and tell you that you have to fucking play a game of pick the civilian instead of actually allowing you to use the equipment to keep you safe just to fucking bomb the bad guys.  Well, if everybody had that way of thinking, Jimmy, we probably would resolve this war quickly, but there's a lot of people who don't have that kind of smarts.  You know, you guys have got pretty good intellectual thought on the whole thing. 
[03:44:00]  You know, I'm not knocking you guys for having your opinion, but, you know, you guys can't really truly understand until you're being fired upon, having RPGs fired at a grenade.  You're right.  You guys really don't understand, truly.  You know, you don't know what it's like to be...  You can understand the ideology behind it and the reasoning behind it, not the actual experience of having it happen to us.  Of course, you're right there.  But, you know, we can understand why troops are committed to a conflict and if it's just or not. 
[03:44:30]  Oh, I'd go back on a third tour in a heartbeat, man, because I believe in fighting for my freedom.  You know, I might have a lot of problems and stuff.  I agree with you, but how is this, how is what was going on in Iraq a threat to us here in America and our freedom, considering he did not have the weapons?  Because they're in partnered with Al-Qaeda, they're all together, they're all the same, they all got the same purpose of trying to end our lives because we don't follow their stupid idealistic religion.  Hold on, but Saddam was not a religious guy at all. 
[03:45:00]  They actually thought Saddam, the true radical Islamist, they thought he was a fucking, an infidel.  Saddam did not rule by religion.  He was kind of a military dictator.  So there was not a religious influence by Saddam.  He kind of would mention Islam just to shut people up.  But, you know, they weren't hand in hand with Iraq.  I mean, with Al-Qaeda, they may have agreed with them.  But that wasn't...  That's all we need.  What's that?  If they agree, then if they agree on something like that, they could agree to send another plane over in one of our buildings. 
[03:45:30]  Okay, well, Syria also agrees with Al-Qaeda, and so does Iran.  If we had to go to a war with everyone that agrees with Al-Qaeda, we'd be everywhere.  And you know what?  The Saudi Arabians agree with Al-Qaeda, although they don't like the methodology.  There are allies, and they agree with Al-Qaeda.  The entire country of Pakistan agrees with Al-Qaeda, just not Musharraf and his military.  Well, hey, we'll go over and bomb them next.  You know, hey, whoever's got something against us, we'll go over there and bomb them to the fucking ground.  But do you see what I'm saying, man?  Instead of just admitting that, you know what, that really wasn't a direct threat to our freedom, 
[03:46:00]  you have to say, well, I'll bomb this.  How about Kim Jong-il in North Korea?  He hates us.  I'm sure he agrees.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, but thank you guys for your time.  All right, Bill.  All right, Bill.  All righty.  By the way, the Revolutionary War, not everybody was for that thing.  What?  A lot of people ended up fighting for the British.  And there was also a lot of people that didn't give a shit either way.  Like fucking Benedict Arnold. 
[03:46:30]  The Rah-Rahs were a small percentage.  Well, and look, they kicked England's ass.  But that's a fact.  It wasn't an all-out, oh, my God, we've got to do this.  Yeah, I was just saying the people that are fighting, they were scared, too, I'm sure.  The Rah-Rahs, you know, got the job done.  But a lot of people think everybody was for that whole British thing.  Getting rid of the British.  They pumped the military, guys, with the word freedom.  And the word freedom gets misused.  Because American freedoms, of course, I want our military to defend our freedom. 
[03:47:00]  But even whether you look at Vietnam, just because fucking communism was advancing,  that wasn't, what the fuck was, Anthony's microphone just shot up in the air.  It got a rod at the word Vietnam.  But that's how they will manipulate guys to do whatever they want them to do.  Yeah.  You know, I'm not talking about real threats like Afghanistan.  They should have went into Afghanistan with fucking flamethrowers and BB-2s.  And really should have blown the country farther back into the Stone Age than it was. 
[03:47:30]  And if they would have stayed there, then the Taliban might not be reassembling.  Yeah, because it's really, I don't see what Iraq, how that was a threat to our freedom here in this country.  I don't see where the threat is.  They sold us a bill of goods with the weapons of mass destruction.  We realized that just was never there.  Who knows if people knew that it wasn't there?  Didn't know.  I'm not even going to get into that.  The fact of the matter is, when they didn't turn up, just like Jimmy said, then the whole reason for the war changed. 
[03:48:00]  Then it was, do you think the American people initially would have said, yes, let's go into Iraq and beat the shit out of them if the only reason Bush gave was, we want to set these people free?  Yep.  No.  Never.  But when we were told that there's all these weapons of mass destruction, there's gas, there's this, that, then we were like, fuck yeah, we don't want this guy with all this shit.  And we went in. 
[03:48:30]  And then when it wasn't there, the reason changed into something that I think a lot of Americans just don't fucking agree with.  I could give a flying fuck about the Iraqi people and their supposed freedom.  Oof.  Yuck.  We lost Vietnam, and Vietnam as a country survived.  Yep.  It's not our problem.  And it's like, I'm for the military.  I hate to see them being injured.  Exactly.  It's protecting people who are ungrateful.  Or protecting or freeing people who are not grateful. 
[03:49:00]  The difference to me is like, if the military is going to be used to protect starving people who are being fucking, truly, genocides committed, that's one thing.  Yeah.  But that was totally different, man.  Yep.  There you go.  Oh, look at us.  We ended on a intellectual note.  Well, I mean, possibly, the whole thing is fucking turned into a decoupage of destruction.  Oh, I like that. 
[03:49:30]  All right.  It's the name of my new CD.  Decoupage of destruction.  We'll talk about the war some more on a future show.  Tomorrow.  Yeah.  A future show.  Ah.  I want that song on CD.  Yeah.  Where is that song?  Get out of here.  Fucking rules.  Line of the day is brought to you by CardScan.  Get all of your contacts organized in just a few seconds.  Check out the device that nobody should be without at CardScan.com slash radio one.  CardScan.com slash radio one. 
[03:50:00]  Do not spell out one.  Here is a runner-up line of the day.  What happened?  What songs were you singing?  Oh, it's just fun songs.  I'm going to guess it was the jingles from beer commercials.  Right to the next runner-up line of the day.  They don't understand what's going in through Adam's mind when he behaves the way he does.  All they see are the externals. 
[03:50:30]  Carol was planning to define you over this morning.  It's going over his head.  It's a sweet bird.  It's flying around his head along with stars and little planets.  They're making a big deal about Oprah's ratings dropping 7%.  They're saying it's her empire crumbling.  Oh, yeah.  Probably if half our audience walked on it.  Fat pigs.  Down 7% from last year.  Here is another runner-up line of the day.  I go, Yorick, how was your time off? 
[03:51:00]  He goes, well, I almost got arrested.  When were you going to tell us?  What did you do?  Did you burp and get charged with air pollution?  Very nice.  420,000 homes destroyed in China's earthquake.  That is amazing.  By the aftershock, I think, right?  Was that just the aftershock?  I think so.  I could be wrong.  Holy shit.  Another runner-up line of the day.  Well, you know, I've been on the radio before.  I know how it works.  Really?  Yeah, I'd say you got to be original. 
[03:51:30]  Do you, you cunt?  That was today?  Yeah.  That seems like days ago.  Didn't he sound like Bob Eatman when he talked?  He did.  Yeah.  He absolutely did.  I thought the same thing.  Surprised he didn't tell us we're off in Vegas.  Fucking creep.  By that, I mean Eatman.  He can't wait to give us the bad news.  Oh, he's fucking awful.  He should hang out.  He's trying to get fucking clit and colostomy, a fucking afternoon drive time slot in Winnipeg. 
[03:52:00]  Winnipeg.  To bite Eatman's face out.  Fucking De Niro and Cape Fear.  Clinton colostomy.  Clinton colostomy.  They do the Clinton colostomy classical music hour with fucking puppet banter.  A lot of C's in their name.  Certainly.  It's very difficult to say.  No one will put it on a bumper sticker.  They don't want to write it on the checks so they can't get hired.  They do an internet radio show out of Clit's house.  Colostomy's house was burned down in a fucking... 
[03:52:30]  In a lighting a fart incident.  Which they did as a fucking...  A supposed ratings grabber.  Grabber.  Holy shit.  Congratulations to Eastside Dave and Casey on their lovely...  Oh, shit.  On their little baby.  The baby was born on my birthday.  What's the baby's name?  Casey Dave, I think.  June.  June?  No, I don't know.  What's the baby's name, Dan?  May.  May?  Juliana.  Oh, Juliana. 
[03:53:00]  That's right.  They named the kid before he was born.  I think they're going to have some fucking weird name for it, but that's a nice name.  Juliana what?  There's more in there.  Hold on.  Cute looking kid, too, man.  I'm sure it is.  So the pick.  So congratulations to them.  Another runner-up line of the day.  Gargoyle.  You would be laughed at and then kicked in the gut.  Of course you would.  Especially if your gargoyle had white stuff leaking out of you.  That's what we do in your words, stupid. 
[03:53:30]  You pillow biter.  Right.  You got to lay on your stomach because you're a gargoyle sore.  Jimmy, you're not allowed to sleep anymore.  Juliana Elise McDonald is her name.  It's a nice name.  It's normal.  Did you decide Dave's last name is McDonald?  I guess so.  Dave McDonald?  Maybe that's who catered the wedding.  I was there.  Why would I say that?  I was trying to think of something.  It didn't work.  All right.  McDonald's doesn't cater. 
[03:54:00]  That's why.  Right.  What?  That was your first misfire of the day.  I've had a bunch of misfires.  I've had a decoupage of misfires.  Right back, the kid bounces.  Bada boop.  Are we doing line of the day now?  Are we doing line of the day now?  Oh, I just said it.  How can you?  Are we doing line of the day now?  McDonald's catered quickly.  Get it.  Are we doing line of the day now?  Yes.  Or we have one more runner-up.  No, this is it.  Line of the day.  Thank you.  Here comes the line of the day. 
[03:54:30]  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  You know, by the way, overhand me this book of all these great celebrity musical auction  they're having at Hard Rock Cafe, I think.  Yeah.  Hard Rock Johnny gave us that.  They got some Beatles stuff, which is pretty interesting.  Right here, I want to get the, I wonder how much they want for the, for the, for the,  the George, the George Harrison hat with gutters. 
[03:55:00]  Miller?  Holy shit.  Why Miller?  Miller?  Is there, is there nothing funnier than when Jimmy can't get a line out because he's laughing  too hard?  Oh, is that fucking funny?  We listened to the Ramone call today. 
[03:55:30]  He was fucking losing it.  Oh, I know.  Yeah, fucking night, nights after a few days off, man, it's so hard to get your sleep back.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I can get my snooze on.  Jimmy, you should have had some five hour energy.  Oh.  I couldn't get my snooze on.  I did when I was trying to sleep.  Would have pepped you right up there, Jimmy.  Yeah.  One to go.  Yeah, let's, uh.  Well, one to go.  That's not how you're supposed to do it.  You hit Steve right in his fucking legs.  We do three a week and I got two in today, boys and girls. 
[03:56:00]  Steve, are you doing the five hour energy?  I'm about to.  Why?  I don't know.  How are you doing?  Oh, this will be the last plug of the week.  I am about to taste some.  Steve is trying five hour energy.  Have some delicious five hour energy.  What is this?  No, no.  Don't read one of those.  Don't read one of those?  Let me tell you something.  This shit works.  That's all you need to know.  Right.  Oh.  Steve.  Jesus, relax.  It's not coming.  Sucks.  Because that's what I thought was in here. 
[03:56:30]  There's another runner up line right there.  Animation festival.  The animators got to get their shit in.  We're panicking or we're going to cancel it.  We're not canceling.  Or we're going to do what?  We're going to fucking do filler and stretch.  Be like every day.  How many animations have come in so far?  Oh.  Five.  Five?  Are they 20 minutes each?  Gee, I hope so. 
[03:57:00]  Oh, boy.  With promise of like 20 more.  That's why I'm...  That's why we're panicking.  Everyone's like, don't worry, don't worry.  But we're worrying.  We're on the stage.  People understand that there's money at stake here.  We've got a lot of...  It's not even about that.  They're doing it, but now they've got to get them in.  No, we've got a lot of guys.  We've got a lot of meticulous artists that are going, don't worry, I'll get it in.  But it's screencaps with the promise of a fucking delivery.  And that's what has...  Making us nutty.  Yeah, that's what's making us nutty.  Thank you, Jimmy.  And what...  Who's doing comedy that night?  Well, right now, I think it's... 
[03:57:30]  Russ Mediv is the only confirmed one.  Russ rules.  Yeah, Russ is hilarious.  Russ is great.  We have our...  He hasn't been in front of an ONA audience yet.  They've seen him, though, with enough ONA comics.  I think Russ will tell.  He's Caroline's all the time.  Yeah, he'll do great.  Yeah, he's going to be awesome.  Who else?  Um, so I've got to talk to you guys about it after the show.  No, there's no talking.  Just a few minutes.  We're in after the show.  I ain't going to sleep.  We already did line of the day.  We're in after the show.  Well, um...  This is after the show.  Yeah, but what if you guys don't like what I say, and you're going to hurt somebody's feelings? 
[03:58:00]  No, we're not.  We'll just say we didn't like it because you said it.  That never works.  All right, this is how it works.  We're just doing it for the radio, so if you hear us say that we don't like a guy...  Oh, look at poor Steve on TV.  It's for, uh...  Yes, hello, I fell out of a tree.  No, I think he was drunk.  Whoa, yeah.  And there's Anthony driving.  There's cars flipping over. 
[03:58:30]  That's not me.  See, that's my problem.  My jokes are visual.  There you go.  All right, so what do you got?  What did you say to the names?  Well, we're looking at...  No!  Okay, that's a no on Jeff Ross.  I think Jeff is right.  We do great.  You think?  Who else?  Birbiglia.  He'd also do well.  For what?  Just comments that I think would succeed in front of the enemy.  I don't even know if they're around.  Yeah, of course.  Both of those guys would do great.  All right, we're going to reach out to those guys then.  And then there's Natterman we're looking at.  Natterman.  I love Natterman. 
[03:59:00]  These guys don't have to do a long set.  Yeah, quick, tight 45.  That's a good joke for the comedians out there, Jimmy.  Very nice.  Yeah, no.  They're going to do like 15 minute sets.  Maybe a quick 15.  Two 15ers.  What else you got?  Watto wants to come in this week.  Watto.  I got to pay.  And then go to sleep.  He made me laugh so hard at his party because every guest he had was fat and he has a patio.  And he said to me something about how he's like, I just had this vision of all these fatties on my deck. 
[03:59:30]  And then it caves in when I actually lean out and hand one of them a radish.  And that's the straw that broke the camel's back.  One radish?  A radish.  He hands him a radish and the whole thing came in.  I fucking, I laughed all night at the, because a radish is such a light.  A food.  It's very airy.  It's not a radish.  In the vegetable family, it's a bit airy, those radishes.  Why would the fat person want a radish? 
[04:00:00]  Why would Otto just not get out and hand the man a radish?  A radish.  But that's what fucking collapses the deck.  And that Otto didn't actually step onto the deck.  He handed it through the door.  Like someone said, Otto, could you fetch me a radish?  And he actually did out of the freezer.  Right.  Or fridge.  Maybe you keep a radish.  I've never owned one.  You don't really own a radish?  I'd keep it in my closet next to my fucking mothballs and carburetors.  You can't really own a radish. 
[04:00:30]  Sure you can.  Well, actually, that's why I have heard that old adage.  No one owns a radish.  They are all but rented friends.  The radish is very holy in certain religions.  Is it?  Yes.  People worship the radish.  They insert it into their anus.  And they crawl around on their hands and knees and do the radish dance.  The radish dance.  Yes.  That's where you crawl to country music.  And then someone smells your asshole and goes, smells like a radish.  And you go, boom. 
[04:01:00]  What the fuck?  And you cut a liquid for it right in front of your face.  Take an eyeful of mud, you.  Here's a mud dry.  I can't do this.  Not anymore.  I got radish in my tuchus.  Someone get me to a doctor.  Well, what else, Steve?  We got to go home.  And then he lit the end of the radish.  Sorry.  You guys want to do a phoner with Frank Shamrock? 
[04:01:30]  Nope.  No.  It's nook.  I don't know enough about Frank Shamrock.  So it would fall.  Those guys are fun in person.  But we're more in-person type of guys.  Yeah, we look at men's men in person.  Great.  Yes.  And Colin tomorrow?  Nope.  Yes.  Of course.  Of course Colin is tomorrow.  What's he promoting?  A Seinfeld.  Besides not a health regimen.  Besides not an exercise program.  It's a charity event with Jerry Seinfeld. 
[04:02:00]  Cool.  Who gets, what lucky radio show gets Jerry?  We get Colin.  The guy that pushed Jerry's car.  That's who we get.  We get the mechanic.  We want the owner.  We want the owner of the car.  Yeah.  Not the pusher.  We want Louie or Alex.  We get latke.  Hey, I'm with you.  Nice.  Fucking.  Going through my taxi lately.  My taxi box.  Season four is not out.  It's been years.  I'm annoyed.  I'm dying for season four.  They only did four?  Five?  No, I did more than that, I think.  How many? 
[04:02:30]  Perhaps more than that.  I don't know.  I want to say five or six.  It was 27 seasons, actually.  Perhaps less than that.  Yeah.  That's right.  What else, Steve?  How was your vacation, Steve?  It was very restful.  Thank you very much.  Cool.  Not unlike your work week.  Yes.  You're right.  Why fake it anymore?  I just go in the back and sleep.  Oh, God damn it.  That's funny.  I guess that's it for today. 
[04:03:00]  Yeah, let's get out of here.  Dan, are you sad?  Last day tomorrow, buddy.  Oh, yeah.  One more day, radish face.  What do you think of that?  Maybe I should have turned your mic on.  Radish ass.  Poor Dan's the only one that has to turn his own microphone on.  I didn't know if you were talking to me, because I would have been talking into dead air.  Are you sad?  Yeah, it's a rollercoaster of emotions.  Ah, what do you mean by that?  Well.  Six flags?  More fun?  Where are you going?  No, what do you mean by a rollercoaster of emotions? 
[04:03:30]  Well, you know, I've really enjoyed my time here, and I'm looking forward to this new phase of my life  where I'll be able to pursue some other stuff and be able to balance my schedule.  Hey, Doug.  And, uh, nobody's listening.  I'm listening.  Hey, how's it going, Jim?  And it's got copied, copied.  And it's got copied.  They're telling me we've got to wrap this up.  No, I know how this works.  We've got plenty of time. 
[04:04:00]  We've got another half hour before the computer shuts us off.  Sorry.  What are you saying?  Plug the website and wrap it up.  Plug the, uh, yeah, you can find out about me at thanedsam.com.  Jimmy, do you want to do one?  Uh, this is our intro music by Oasis.  All right, you do what you do.  And I just wanted to say, um, thanks to all the fans for all their nice sentiments.  They, uh, on the message boards, I appreciate it very much. 
[04:04:30]  95% of them are very, uh, kind things.  Wishing me luck on my new adventure.  But mostly what I've liked here is the people.  Um, the people have made this a special, special place.  Opie, Anthony, Jim.  Um, uh, we only have a couple minutes left because I hear the, the, uh, end of our, the 
[04:05:00]  Dan and Sam show music's playing by the Pixies.  I see a break signed by Sam.  No, I got till the end of this song.  But I'll be here tomorrow too to hopefully recapture some more of this stuff.  No.  Uh, I know something's going on.  Nobody around here is telling me, but something's going on.  Something crazy's happening.  And, uh, I'm ready, guys.  I'm just saying I'm ready for something special.  No, I don't want the decoupage, Sam. 
[04:05:30]  But thank you.  Uh, it's got a big hole in it.  It's been a crazy ride, guys.  And I've learned a lot.  I don't want the saw either, Sam.  Sam, thank you.  I'm not going to get emotional right now.  Because like I said, I do have tomorrow.  We mean a family.  I love this song. 
[04:06:00]  Again, go to thanandsam.com for, uh, important updates regarding the Than and Sam show and,  uh, me personally.  Sam, you'll put up some of my, uh, stuff, right?  In terms of what's going on in my life.  Sam's shrugging.  Uh, he's doing a non-audio cue to me because he doesn't want to actually give me radio.  It's kind of like the Than Sam show.  Uh, yeah.  Uh.  I'm going to come on you like nobody's ever come on you before. 
[04:06:30]  Now Danny's just going through our folder in Dillette.  I eat asshole.  Thank you, Tony.  Um, I don't want this box that the decoupage came in.  So that's what's, uh, that's where I'm at.  Yeah, this is my favorite drop.  Maybe I'll do a little of my act right here on the radio.  What do you think?  I don't need a hammer to do my act.  Do Carl. 
[04:07:00]  Carl?  Yeah.  All right.  Ready?  All right.  So there's, uh, I'm from a very white area.  Um, in fact, uh, we have a name for the black community.  Life in corporate America can be a grind.  All they do is they remove the humor from everything.  And you don't want to worry about your behavior around the office becoming a problem.  I'm standing here with this erection feeling silly. 
[04:07:30]  You're going to need some sound advice.  Talk less and suck more.  From a qualified professional.  I'm a stand-up comic who hates his own guts.  New from... </pre>
