<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with sexually suggestive banter about the weather and Opie's fear of bees in soda cans. This quickly transitioned into a graphic recounting of the previous day's show featuring women from Beezid, described in explicit detail.  The conversation then turned to the Lawrence Taylor sex crime allegations, with the hosts engaging in crude speculation and jokes about the details.  Numerous listener calls offered various perspectives on the LT case, further fueling the offensive humor and sexually explicit discussions.  The segment ended with promotion of a Borgata show and the playing of Troy Kwan's "Side Pussy," reinforcing the show's explicit nature.

The next segment featured a highly sexually explicit opening with Patrice as a guest. This was followed by listener-submitted "F.U." messages, equally vulgar.  The majority of the segment focused on a purportedly botched Tyra Banks talk show prank, with the hosts and others criticizing Banks with profanity.  Speculation about the contents of Banks' water bottle ensued.  The show then shifted to Lady Gaga's music and MoMA appearance, before dedicating a significant portion to a call with Sean, whose girlfriend was interested in Troy.  This resulted in a lengthy, graphic discussion of Sean's relationship problems, his sex life, and the possibility of Troy having sex with Sean's girlfriend.  Troy and Sean were in studio for this segment;  Nerd's previous week appearance and a breakdancing video of Bobo were also mentioned.  The segment concluded with a promotion of the "Cherry Darts" segment.

A substantial portion of the show centered on Sean and his girlfriend, Kat, suspected of infidelity.  The ensuing conversation was incredibly sexually explicit, focusing on graphic descriptions of Kat's alleged sexual encounters and Sean's sexual performance, including repeated discussions of body part sizes and smells.  Kat was eventually brought on the phone, participating in the vulgar discussion, which also included details about her interactions with other men, including a "Sex and the City" actor. Listener calls, sound bites, and photo analysis further fueled the explicit content.

A significant portion of the show involved a bizarre attempt to force Sam, a studio employee, into a shirtless hug with Sean.  The hosts used insults, homophobic slurs, and threats to pressure Sam, referencing past incidents involving Sam and a dildo.  Sam resisted vehemently.  The conversation veered into discussions of attractiveness and sexual orientation.  A phone guest, initially Natalie, revealed himself as Bob Levy, briefly joining the discussion. After a break, Troy removed his shirt, resulting in a brief shirtless hug.  The hosts then assessed the "success" of the stunt, before touching on Mother's Day ads, *Iron Man 2* reviews, Chaz Bono’s transition (with the display and commentary of numerous pictures), and a lengthy, highly critical discussion of Kent the Movie Guy, which resulted in an angry call from Kent, revealing his recent breakup.  The entire segment was rife with vulgar and offensive language.

The final segment began with an apology to a listener previously mocked regarding an oil spill solution.  The hosts then discussed a significant Dow Jones drop caused by a trader's error, followed by outrage over a California school’s ban on American flag shirts on Cinco de Mayo.  This led to a discussion of a Black-only field trip in Ann Arbor, Michigan, with a listener ("Drew") providing further details.  The hosts expressed strong opinions on political correctness, immigration, racial disparities in crime statistics, and systemic racism, with a call from "Brother Joe."  Their commentary included critiques of Al Sharpton and concluded with pictures of E-Rock's damaged eyes after a mayonnaise challenge and further inflammatory remarks regarding discrimination in various institutions.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The O.B. and Anthony Show starts now.  Previously on O&A.  Now you can see over the region, not much activity going on.  Relatively clear, and it looks like we're going to continue to see  some chances for some showers moving in from the northwest  as we get into tomorrow afternoon.  Uh-oh, I better put on my rubbers.  It's going to be relatively queer out.  Let's see where is that on the map.  Right over my house.  A bunch of raindrops with my face on them. 
[00:00:30]  Foundry cogs are falling from the sky.  I'm very scared to have a can of anything out on my table  when the weather's nice outside  because I'm petrified a bee is going to fly in there  and then I'm going to drink it.  Okay, I'm soda.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  That is something that is a great fear of mine.  I think Anthony was molested.  Yeah?  The fear?  No.  I do have a lot of fear.  You don't want to put it to your mouth  and you don't want the bee to fly in your mouth. 
[00:01:00]  Do you think that represents a cock and release the poison?  Yeah.  The poison on your tongue?  There's a stinger that goes in your mouth  and then there's poison.  Yeah.  Oh, you might be right.  Are you on Beezid or not on the website?  We're not on the website.  Why aren't you girls on the website?  That's insane.  I think we will be.  What are they, queers?  Oh, my God.  We'll get back.  Really?  God damn.  What did you do on Howard?  Did you take all your clothes off?  No, we judged the hottest tranny contest.  Wow. 
[00:01:30]  We gave them $5,000.  Who won?  Howard won.  It was a release.  Oh, I'm kidding.  Howard, stop.  If the queen was in your studio now with your banger,  she spread her life.  No.  No.  I let her suck my cock while cuckold Phillip watched.  Cuckold, cuckold Phillip.  And she did that stupid wave under your balls.  That's what that's for.  That's how she, yeah, massages your balls.  Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right. 
[00:02:00]  Dumb wave right under your sack.  Yeah, she takes her glove and she'll just,  she has like one finger, but it's on your taint.  And it mushes your taint skin.  Like her finger dings into your taint and it wraps around it  and fucking, your taint, it's like your taint's been put  in a washing machine.  Yes.  P. and Anthony, live next. 
[00:02:30]  P. and Anthony, live next.  P. and Anthony. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  Thank you. 
[00:05:30]  Thank you. 
[00:06:00]  Freedom of fucking speech, like we've said many times, the freedom to say some awful  things.  You might not like it, but we have the right to say them.  Oh, my.  We have low self-esteem as a show.  They are not doing anything.  They're not highly skilled.  They have no talent.  We're just exploiting people.  See, kids?  Smoke your pot.  Play your video games and watch TV.  You'll be better off when you get our age.  There's no ratings here.  There's no ratings here.  No one cares.  Enough of this, palaver. 
[00:06:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  We made it to Friday.  Looks like it.  Or I should have said, I made it to Friday.  I thought I would have a kid by now, and I wouldn't be doing radio this week.  Yeah.  This is your last show.  I figured this on the way in.  This is your last show as a guy who doesn't have a kid.  Which means starting next week, I get to be that guy. 
[00:07:00]  You know, guys, now that I have a kid.  You know, guys, I'm a dad now.  Right.  I want to talk to you about the type of radio we're doing.  I think we need to change it up a little bit now.  You'll be doing these shenanigans.  Imagine I become that guy.  I want to be a morning zoo guy.  Actually, I'm thinking about, you know, the show really needs a female presence.  Just, you know, keep us in check a little bit. 
[00:07:30]  Well, if it was one of the females from yesterday's show, then I'm all for it.  If we had one of those Beezid girls in here every morning.  Beezid.  It would be the worst radio show in America.  But, man, would we be happy.  What's, uh, I was thinking about that, too.  The whole website that goes around, like, getting your attention with hot girls.  That seems an odd thing to do.  Like, I don't know.  You don't see, like, Google carting around girls or, eh. 
[00:08:00]  Plenty of websites.  It's Priceline.  They got William Shatner.  You know, it's not like, hey, Priceline's coming through.  And here's some hot girls.  True.  What is that?  It's a great way to market a new website, though.  Oh, it certainly is.  I think after yesterday's show, a lot more people at least know about Beezid.  Beezid, whether they use them or go there is another thing.  But at least they know the name, Beezid.com.  They do.  So, those girls were fucking terrific, man.  Oh, my God. 
[00:08:30]  I had a little pole.  The brunette kicked the blonde's ass, too, Jimmy.  You had a little pole?  Well, no.  I don't have a little pole.  Oh, I thought you had a little pole.  I was going to say.  Most people, I think, would have liked the brunette.  I just, the blonde I liked because she was, like, just a bigger, tall girl.  And there was something about her that just was so fucking juicy, man.  Well, when I played the video for the 20th time, I was starting to dig the blonde girl.  The blonde is, like, um.  She was all right.  Big, deep ass crack.  She was all right.  If you remember, when George Costanza wanted to have sex with a giant woman. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Like, she would have fit that criteria.  Oh, my God.  What did she say?  She was, like, 6'4 with her heels on yesterday?  Yes.  It's crazy.  We got a tough job.  And then there's something about girls with really big boobs just, like, pressing them up against the glass.  I think that brings me back to a kid in a Kentucky Fried movie did that in the shower.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  So, to this day, that's one of my things.  I like seeing that because I think it brings me back to just a little kid, you know, watching that dirty movie.  It was a dirty movie for a little teenage kid. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, it was Catholic high school girls in trouble.  In trouble.  And they would have, like, these big fucking well-endowed women up against the shower glass door.  They were soaked up, and they were getting, like, pounded from behind.  So, their tits are just banging against the glass.  Yeah, they're getting pushed more into the glass.  And didn't they make some squeaky noises?  Like, ee, ee, ee, eee.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't even know if Kentucky Fried movie – you know what?  I know it doesn't hold up.  Yeah.  I think we were in Boston, and I was excited. 
[00:10:00]  I was trying to turn people on to Kentucky Fried movies.  So, I don't even think it was on DVD.  I think you still had to go VHS, even though this was mid-'90s.  But they didn't commit to make that into a DVD yet, so you had to go old school.  And I remember having a viewing party of Kentucky Fried Movie, and everyone was like, why do you like this movie?  It didn't really hold up, I guess.  It was, you know, a thing for the time.  When you see Catholic High School Girls in Trouble, Samuel L. Bronkowitz presents Linda Chambers recreating her classic role. 
[00:10:30]  And introducing Susan Joyce and Nancy Reeves.  Susan, this is Nancy. Nancy, this is Susan.  See, they're introducing.  The screen has never dared to be so explicit.  Show me your nuts.  How are you doing?  Burf in your face.  See, he's nuts. 
[00:11:00]  It's funny.  Oh, shit.  Mrs. Burke, I thought you were Dale.  You know, people often mistake me for my teenage daughter, Dale.  This girl being felt up in the shower.  Never before has the beauty of this sexual act been so crassly exploitive.  There it is.  At the same time, look at the shower door.  This is our story of what happens when high school girls are allowed to stay out at the curfew. 
[00:11:30]  And they just get a midget in a clown suit and whipping them up.  They're naked.  Brutal.  Savage.  Savage.  Beyond perversion.  You must see Catholic High School Girls in Trouble.  Where's that from? 
[00:12:00]  That's Kentucky Fried Movie.  Oh, it is.  Okay, okay.  Yeah, it's a fake trailer.  They did a lot of fake trailers in them.  I don't know.  I kind of liked the movie when I was growing up.  Yeah, when you're growing up, it was the shit.  You went to, like, the drive-in and watched that.  Wasn't there another one where, like, a guy had impotence, he couldn't have sex with his wife,  and some big black dude.  Big Jim Slade.  That's right, Big Jim Slade comes flying through the whole wall to fuck his wife or something.  This comes in, yeah.  Can you find that one, too?  He's, like, the cuckold or something. 
[00:12:30]  Big Jim Slade.  Yeah.  It's premature ejaculation, I think.  You know, that was a delicious dinner.  They just had a nice romantic dinner.  Two black people cuddling on the couch.  Whispers a sweet little nothing in her ear.  I don't think black people cuddle.  I don't think so, either.  I'm not sure.  I think they get right down to it.  Yeah, get down to business, especially if you're LT.  We'll get into LT in a minute or two.  LT's getting into something else.  Got him in trouble.  All right. 
[00:13:00]  He's taking the record off.  He's putting on something else.  The little black girl with the afros, smiling.  This is, what, his love music?  Oh, yeah.  This guy's already ready to rock.  Yeah.  Oh, it's that guy.  Yeah, baby.  He's kind of doing a little dance over to her.  Welcome to the wonderful world of sex.  Oh, that's right.  Where together we will achieve a new and exciting level of sexual fulfillment.  After dimming the lights, give your partner a reassuring smile and a gentle kiss. 
[00:13:30]  Kissing.  Kissing.  Then, move to opposite areas of the bedroom to disrobe.  Looks like a how-to, obviously.  Opposite answer.  She's taking her big 70s pants off.  Oh, yeah.  The revelation of erogenous zones is an enticing prelude to sexual foreplay.  Become aware now of your own body as it readies itself for the ultimate sensual awareness. 
[00:14:00]  It is now time to...  That's how it's talking about.  Very awkward.  He's placing both hands on his face.  Hopping across the room.  Ah!  Moving smoothly up the torso.  Slowly stepping into the erotic areas.  Just a clutch.  Gently exploring the curves of the upper body.  There.  Wasn't that nice? 
[00:14:30]  Now you are ready to approach the conjugal bed.  Should we bow?  This is going to go on forever.  Relaxing as you fill your senses in your world of awareness.  At this time...  She has nice big tits.  She looks good.  She's in her broad panties.  I love you.  B.  I need you.  Or C.  Yeah, it's three bells.  Get tits forever.  Very slow.  At the end, a big black guy comes in and grabs her because he comes too soon.  Right.  He fucking comes in his little shorts. 
[00:15:00]  And she needs big Jim Slade.  The kissing should be increasingly passionate.  With both partners working into a sexual frenzy.  He makes cumsies.  One of the most frequent problems encountered during the sexual act is that of premature ejaculation.  His face is great.  He looks like a lot of shots.  Should premature ejaculation occur, the Joy of Sex album comes equipped with... 
[00:15:30]  Big Jim Slade.  That's an animal.  Big Jim, former tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs, is outfitted with various whips, chains,  and a sexual appetite that will knock your socks off.  Big Jim has satisfied women throughout the world.  And the capital of Nebraska is Lincoln.  He just carries her away.  Just a cuckold sis there.  Just carries his fucking one.  Yeah.  Ah, whatever.  It was back in the old days, you know.  It was a different time, Opie.  True.  Where were we?  Oh, so the Beezid girls pressing their boobs up against the glass brought me back to Kentucky Fried Movie, 
[00:16:00]  and that's why we just played a couple trailers.  One worked, and one was mediocre at best, but that's okay.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  But that's okay.  That's what we do.  LT, yeah.  LT's in a little bit of a jam up.  Well, I don't know what to think here.  Rape, rapety, rape, rape.  Is it a big rapety, rape, rape?  Rape, rapety, rape, rape, I think, from what I'm hearing.  There's a pimp involved, right?  Yeah.  But was the girls saying she was forced to go to LT's? 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  But why was she with a pimp?  I heard she was a runaway.  She was a runaway.  Can you make heads or tails out of this?  I don't know where he fucked her.  Oh, I believe that he...  Heads and tails?  I believe he went for a hooker, absolutely.  He went for the ass?  He wanted a hooker.  I don't know if he asked for an underaged girl.  16's a dicey age, because you could...  Yeah!  You don't know if a girl is underage. 
[00:17:00]  You could fucking go 16 and think she's 19 or 20.  That's not like...  It's not like he's fucking a 13-year-old where you know it's a kid.  16's a weird age.  She, it seems, was a runaway.  Right.  Right?  And...  So she was playing with Joan Jett.  Go ahead.  Yes, yes.  Yeah.  Teeth hurts.  Good one, Chip.  Oh, wait.  You weren't being Chip?  No, I wasn't.  I was being Jimmy.  Being bombing Jimmy?  Oh, boy.  Joan Jett.  She, uh... 
[00:17:30]  So she hooks up with this, uh...  Pimp.  This guy that served 16 years in prison for manslaughter.  What?  Yeah.  Oh, that's good.  He's a real nice guy.  It's good to know he learned a thing or two in prison.  Yeah.  She was...  Now has a really nice job out there in society.  Doing a good job.  Doing a great job.  Wow.  He, uh...  He beat her because she was beat up, is what I heard.  She had some marks on her.  Well, they're blaming LT for the beating and the black eye. 
[00:18:00]  But the...  Well, he is a black guy.  No, black eye.  Black eye.  Oh, see, that's, uh...  Hold on.  That's different.  You think if Pip's telling her to blame LT and she's doing it?  Yeah, probably.  So she hooks up with LT for 300 bucks at a Holiday Inn.  But LT used a third party, right?  Not the pimp?  Yeah, that's the pimp guy.  Oh, the pimp guy's the third party.  The pimp guy brought the girl over to be with LT.  I see.  I thought there was somebody else besides that.  And she's 16.  Right.  So, that's a problem for LT. 
[00:18:30]  Of course.  Because no one gives a shit about what Jimmy was just saying in the news.  And public opinion.  Oh, I know.  It doesn't matter that, well, 16's a dicey age.  Or, well, the pimp brought her over.  Well, she was a prostitute.  She was dead.  She's a 16-year-old runaway that was being beaten by her pimp that is then dropped off at a Holiday Inn to fuck Lawrence Taylor against her will.  These are the allegations that have been made. 
[00:19:00]  And, wow, that's a lot of trouble for a guy that has been in jail for cocaine and other shenanigans.  He had two crack incidents.  Yeah.  And a drunk driving, I believe.  Yeah.  Since he retired.  But a lot of heavy sleepers at that Holiday Inn.  A 16-year-old having sex against her will and no one is noticing the whole hotel is shaking.  Oh, my God.  Right?  He jumped on her and she busted her leg. 
[00:19:30]  See, get it?  That's a Joe Theismann.  I won't even say joke.  You know what?  A Joe Theismann unfactual statement.  The accused pimp, Rashid Davis, fucking Irish guy.  Rashid Davis?  I know.  Oh, God.  You can't.  They're always involved, the Irish.  This is bad for LT, though.  He beat and kicked the terrified girl as they drove to Taylor's Hotel.  But before they left the city, she managed to text message her estranged uncle who alerted the cops. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, shit.  This is a real.  So this is an after-the-fact.  She said something.  After-the-fact she's bullshitting.  When you're texting as they're driving you over.  No kidding.  I didn't know that.  I didn't get that far in the article.  Remember, first two paragraphs is all you need in news stories.  So she texted her uncle?  Yeah.  Paul?  I got a text message, but I deleted it.  I was busy busting on in.  She's a tattletale.  Yeah, she always does that. 
[00:20:30]  Help me.  Help me.  Now, was she a fresh runaway?  Yeah, she would always talk back.  I don't know.  Very fresh.  Was she a fresh runaway?  I don't know.  I don't know, but was she...  The pimp grabbed her, basically, and then maybe called LT and said, look, I got something nice.  Met her at the police station.  What?  I think they met at the police station, is what I heard.  Who?  The pimp guy and this girl. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  That's where the pimps are going now?  Bus stop?  I heard a Bronx bus stop.  Where'd the police station come in?  That might have been while I was yelling at an Asian gentleman driving in when the news was on.  I might have crossed some stories.  I usually yell at Asian people as I'm driving in.  That's what I do.  Or cab drivers that insist on doing 20 through the Midtown Tunnel.  So the second I pop out...  The second the cab driver gets out of my way and went through the tunnel, I pop out like 
[00:21:30]  one of the fighters from Battlestar Galactica.  Yeah.  Like, I fly out of the tunnel, beep the horn, drive into the cab driver a little bit to get  him scared, and then I just start yelling and flipping the bird, because there's no reason  to do 20 through the tunnel.  Very, very angering.  A parade of cars behind us.  Oh, it pissed me off.  Well, they're trying to be careful through the tunnel.  Are they?  I don't know.  It's ridiculous.  I'm with you.  You know what it is?  If you're in a cab, you've got to figure, hey, wow, there's tractor trailers, not tractor 
[00:22:00]  trailers, but box trucks driving through the tunnel.  Box trucks!  I think you can take your little stupid cab and not hit the cones or the wall.  It is just...  The lanes are skinny.  I mean...  Yeah, but you know what?  Who made these things?  Why can't you have a nice wide tunnel?  Everywhere else in America, you do have wide tunnels, but here in New York, they are skinny  lanes.  Well, we'll take the lanes out and make it like first class.  I mean, very manageable lines. 
[00:22:30]  Very manageable, and you should be able to do 60 in the tunnel, no problem.  I've done 80 through that tunnel.  No, I know, but I'm just saying.  I'm texting in an Escalade.  But the basic person could easily do 60 is what I'm saying.  Yeah.  You could do more.  You're right.  But they are skinny fucking lanes.  There are times where I don't even care.  I wish they'd do the speed limit, which is 40 most of the time.  40 is the speed limit for the tunnel?  Through the tunnel.  I didn't know that.  It starts out at 25 right when you get into the tunnel, and then it turns to 40 around  that first curve. 
[00:23:00]  And then once it hits 40, do fucking 40.  Don't keep doing 25, dumb cab.  40 feels real slow if you're behind a guy going 40.  Yeah, yeah.  You just don't want the...  Because the right lane is for trucks, and the left lane is for cars that want to go  faster.  Right.  And when the trucks start passing you because some idiot is doing 25 or 20 in the tunnel,  you just want to kill somebody.  Sure.  So when we popped out of that tunnel, and I did that to him, we ended up next to each  other at a light, and he's looking at me like I'm the asshole, and I'm just like throwing  my arms up and flipping the bird at him. 
[00:23:30]  Sure.  Here's something else about the tunnels in New York.  Why do you need to have a fucking turn in the tunnel?  You couldn't line up this thing better?  There's nothing in your way.  It's all fucking water.  Come on.  Straight run.  What are they turning around?  Like a dinosaur fucking bones or something?  Why do you have to turn in a tunnel?  I think the whole trick to that is so you're not going down an incline that is a mountain  to get underneath the bedrock of the water.  Like you turn, and it's almost like going up a mountain road. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  You don't get the straight road.  You kind of do that little turny thing first.  Yeah, I get it, but I don't think...  You could maybe set up the dip-off a little further in advance.  That's what I'm saying.  If you're going to be the guy responsible for designing a tunnel, you can figure it out  where it's one straight line.  There's nothing else in the way.  Look, they made it years ago.  It's a fucking miracle.  Good point.  Good point.  So LT...  Did you know that that tunnel goes under the ground?  Oh, yeah, I always do that. 
[00:24:30]  That's under the river?  Yeah.  I only knew that for the last few years.  Isn't that amazing?  Most of my life, I thought it was just a dump tube.  It's kind of resting on the river bottom.  Yeah, it's dry.  Yeah.  It's so deep, it's actually dry.  They just go underneath the fucking...  The bed of the river.  Yeah.  It's sick.  How the fuck did they figure that out?  I don't know.  LT's...  I don't know, I don't think he knew how old this girl was, and it looks like the guy,  he said he was out with some golf buddies.  He was a fucking attorney?  But he's hanging with, like, a guy that spent 16 years for manslaughter. 
[00:25:00]  How did he know this guy?  They said that he was out with some friends drinking, and he was saying that he would love  to get some ass.  Oh.  And then this girl just showed up at the apartment, at the hotel, meaning one of these  guys might have called the pimp.  Now, I don't believe that.  Wow.  He probably said, do you know anybody?  Yeah.  Yeah, maybe I do.  Right.  But I don't know if Lawrence actually called this pimp or knew it was a pimp.  I have no idea, or who the fuck knows?  Right.  He might have just said, you know any girls?  Yeah, I know a guy who can get you a chick.  And supposedly TMZ's reporting that they found a condom in LT's. 
[00:25:30]  And a bottle of booze, yeah.  In LT's room.  Is it, was it used?  Because it's one of those classic, I don't know if you feel like doing it today, but LT's  in the Holiday Inn, he has sex, whether he knew she was underage or not, and then he  goes to sleep, and the hooker and the pimp and everyone is gone, and he's now getting  a nice night's sleep, just assuming he's home free after getting a little ass.  Yeah, but he didn't wake up knowing that he was in trouble. 
[00:26:00]  Oh.  I don't think so.  No.  Didn't they wake him up or something?  They went to the hotel.  He was the resident.  They found booze, a condom, and they took the sheets as evidence.  Oh, you'd never want them taking the sheets.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  That thing's going to light up like a Peter Max poster when they put the light on it.  You think you're having a tug of war with the sheets?  Yeah.  No, don't take the sheets.  Give me the sheets.  Don't take the sheets.  Give me the sheets.  Anything but the sheets.  And the condom, they didn't say if it was full or used or something? 
[00:26:30]  Well, they're basically saying it was a used condom.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was in a wastebasket or something.  Well, he used a condom.  What a guy.  What a guy.  What a guy.  Wow.  He's in a bit of a jam up, I'd say.  Yeah, but he could only do four years.  Why?  They're saying up to four years.  Up to four years?  Yeah.  What if there's like a salt in there and stuff?  She was a prostitute. 
[00:27:00]  They don't care as much.  People really don't care about workers.  They don't care as much for prostitutes.  No, I think that's what I read.  Up to four years in jail.  He was just doing one of those things, a celebrity.  He did dancing.  Yeah, but he was one of those dancers.  There's something of fame and addiction, I think, was something like that.  On A&E or something.  Yeah, he did one of those and talked about how he spent $1.4 million on cocaine during 
[00:27:30]  the time he was doing coke.  What a rookie.  Rookie.  And how he had no problem saying that he's Lawrence Taylor and he's an addict.  And now, you know, it's into a little bit of a jam up.  He's had a tough time since he was getting his life together.  No, no.  It never looked like he was getting his life together.  No.  He had like 12 years sober, I think.  Yeah, but he's been retired since 93. 
[00:28:00]  Wow.  Crack, crack.  Crackety crack.  Two cracks.  One drinking and driving and now a rape.  That's good.  So he's got a crack, crack, drunk driving rape on his record.  They're like stats.  Like baseball players.  Well, you collect them all, Ant.  You know, hit around the fucking cycle and shit like that.  Sure.  He's getting like, what is that, the 2020 club?  I'll trade you one rape for, what do you got over there?  Well, you got two cracks.  All right, I'll take that.  And LT getting a rape on top of his cocaine and booze. 
[00:28:30]  It's fabulous for his record.  Unbelievable.  He just can't figure it out after football.  And there it is.  LT gets a rape.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  Oh, we got Cruz and Colin checking in.  Cruz and Colin.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Good morning, Cruz and Colin.  I'd like to call in and play devil's advocate.  Sure, sure.  I just think we should cut LT some slack. 
[00:29:00]  He was probably just trying to find a friend.  Maybe going to help her buy some school books, you know.  It's just stupid.  Cruz and Colin.  Buy some school books.  Yeah.  That might have happened.  Yeah, big misunderstanding.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, all right, we got Richie Boy.  Richie Boy.  Hey, what's up, boys?  How are you, buddy?  Hey, man.  This sounds like a complete and total setup by the pimp and prostitute. 
[00:29:30]  They knew they had LT as their client.  And I believe 100% that they set this whole thing up in advance, making the call to the  uncle, sending over a 16-year-old girl.  You know, they probably told LT they were bringing her over a hooker.  It didn't say whether or not she was underage.  He just thinks he's getting a hooker.  She goes in.  He fucks her.  And she leaves.  All right.  What's the reason for the setup, if not for financial gain? 
[00:30:00]  What is this?  It is going to be financial gain.  This girl is going to fucking sue him financially.  I guarantee you that we will see in the coming months that this girl is going to fucking sue  him, you know, civilly for millions of dollars.  That's the deal.  And she probably has a deal with this pimp guy.  Suing Lawrence Taylor.  He came all over my ass, Nick.  There's a lot of holes in your theory. 
[00:30:30]  I mean, so an uncle's going to allow his niece to just get fucked by LT, who supposedly  has a massive fucking unit, just so they could get money down the road?  But also, if you're-  That's crazy.  If you're Lawrence Taylor, how do you let a prostitute and a pimp know who you are before  they're at the room?  It just doesn't matter.  That's true.  How would you announce-  I'm Lawrence Taylor.  Exactly.  If you're shopping for a hooker, why would you announce who you are?  Yeah.  And also, here's a problem with the theory.  Rasheed Davis is on parole for something.  He might have to go back and finish a 10-year-old man slaughter, so he may have to go back 
[00:31:00]  and do 10 years.  Because he broke his parole.  Because there was a parole breach, sir.  Yeah.  Let him bring a 16-year-old girl to his hotel.  A 16-year-old girl.  Yeah, they were doing Oxycontin, and there was an Advil.  An Advil.  Some Anacin.  Yeah, she took an Anacin, Sam.  She needed it.  She had a headache.  L.T. split her ass all open.  You wouldn't know about that, Sam. 
[00:31:30]  You're an Asian.  Sometimes women say, ouch.  Monaghan, you have to protect these children.  Ah, Quince, I can't do nothing.  I can't do nothing.  Your boss is shaving his mustache all over my balls and asshole.  So, sir, what do you say?  All I'm saying is that I think that the uncle probably was not in on the gig.  That that was part of the plan to make it look realistic.  Let's say, hey, call your uncle. 
[00:32:00]  Let him know what's going on.  You know, let him know you're being taken to this place.  Blah, blah.  What about Rasheed Davis, though, again, now facing 10 years back in prison?  If this is true and he brought her and he has to go back, if it's a parole violation, what about the possibility?  Why would this guy do that?  They're going to break him out with thermite paint.  This guy's conspiracy is falling apart.  Plus, his estate is going to pay regardless.  Sir, why don't you just admit that you had a theory and it was shooting holes in it.  Why are you insisting? 
[00:32:30]  Shooting holes in it.  It looks like Swiss cheese at this point.  Yeah, you really, sir.  Why are you pursuing it when it's obviously not what happened?  And I would like to know how much money LT has left.  He retired in 93, man.  Yeah.  Look, I'm not freaking Houdini.  I wasn't there.  So, I guess...  Houdini was a magician, sir.  Not a creature of mystic and magical.  I'm not Houdini.  I wasn't there.  What does that mean, sir?  You're Houdini. 
[00:33:00]  I don't know what the hell I'm trying to say.  What?  Exactly.  Why would Houdini have any...  You are Houdini.  You make entertaining radio disappear.  Oh, God, dude.  Our audience would rather be handcuffed and put in a tub of water.  I hope he dies just like Houdini.  Oh, come on.  Someone punch him in the chest.  You are Houdini, the rap group.  Shut up.  All right, Richie boy.  Oh, dummy.  He hung up. 
[00:33:30]  He couldn't take it anymore.  As he should have.  I don't know.  I mean, there's some questions to be answered here, sure.  But it looks like, in my humble opinion, LT went for a hooker, whether he was underage or not.  And I guess he told the arresting officer, I did read this in one of the papers, so it's not going to be one of those things that we have to apologize for, that he said something like, I didn't know she was underage.  And you know what?  It's your responsibility to make sure she's not underage in the end.  That's tough, too, man, because all girls are underage.  He's saying, I didn't know she was underage. 
[00:34:00]  So it looks like he was more than willing to have someone come into his room.  So I'm suspicious about the black guy.  I don't think, I'm starting to think maybe LT didn't do that.  Maybe the pimp did that.  Oh, they said the pimp was beating her on the way up.  Sure, but they're blaming LT on the beating.  Well, you got to smack a bitch.  Initially, they were anyway.  Wow.  Initially, they were.  Yeah.  Sounds like a, yeah.  You got to smack a bitch.  And it looks like the LT thinking she was willing, she wasn't willing, so all hell broke loose after she left that hotel room. 
[00:34:30]  And that's where we're at today.  And it looks like he can get up to four years.  But now, I mean, his reputation was shaky at best.  It wasn't that bad, actually, because he ended up on Dancing with the Stars, right?  Was he on that?  Wasn't he on Dancing with the Stars a couple?  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't know that.  A couple of seasons ago.  So now his reputation, I mean, this is it.  Where my money, bitch?  I absolutely don't.  And you pop her an eye.  Huh?  That's how our pimps work.  Yeah.  They say, where my money, bitch?  Yeah.  And then you punch her an eyeball.  We got a motherfucking defensive player that we're going to need you to have some sex with. 
[00:35:00]  But I don't want to.  I said, ah, right in the face.  Go ahead.  Fuck him.  There you go.  When he pulled that giant rod out.  Jesus.  Wasn't that the one that also had Jeffrey Ross as the partner on Dancing with the Stars?  She really fucking went higher up on the masculine chart.  Yeah.  Look how black LT is.  Holy shit.  So black.  And so accused of rape.  The only reason I say that is we got pictures of his Dancing with the Stars. 
[00:35:30]  And yeah, that was the same girl that Jeffrey Ross ended up having on Dancing with the Stars,  I believe.  Look at the contrast.  My God, man.  Look at the contrast in what would have happened years ago and what happens now.  Jesus.  He gets paid for doing this.  Years ago, well, it would have been a different story.  He'd have gotten paid, all right.  Let's go to Tom and Stony Brook.  You know what I mean.  If that picture was in black and white and a little grainy.  I see you're at least trying to control yourself because it's taken a lot longer. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, it took a half hour today.  That's not bad.  But I think it's a new record.  If you put all right after anything, it sounds bad, though.  He'd have gotten paid.  Yeah, he'd have gotten paid, all right.  All right.  All of a sudden, it's not bad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He'd have gotten paid, all right.  You know what I mean.  I'd love a kiss.  You'll get a kiss.  That's nice.  You'll get a kiss, all right.  You'll get a kiss, all right.  It's very bad.  Now it's ominous.  Let's go to Tom in Stony Brook. 
[00:36:30]  Tom.  Hey, Tom.  Hey, what's up, boys?  How you doing?  How's it going?  Hey, Jimmy.  Hi, Tommy.  Just curious.  Is this rape or is this rape, rapety-rape, rape-rape, or rape-ity-rape?  I think it's just rape.  Rape, rape-ity-rape is like, I don't know.  I don't know.  If he would have beat her around, maybe tooled her in the ass, stuff like that.  Hard to believe that he would have beat her up on top of it.  I think he was really just going for some sex and didn't realize that she, he realized 
[00:37:00]  she was young, but I don't think he realized she was that young.  Yeah.  Sex with him is probably like beating her anyway.  She just assaulted.  Let's go to Pat in Staten Island.  Pat.  Pat.  Morning, Ope.  Hey, buddy.  You know, I got to agree with you, Ope.  How much money could he have if he's in Ramapo and a Holiday Inn?  Yeah.  That's what I was thinking, too.  I mean, if you've got some cash left over, you're not looking up Holiday Inns.  You're just going for the nicest hotel in the area.  Can I ask Jimmy a question?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:37:30]  Dodge, they should have went to the Radisson.  Is it reasonable?  Is it reasonable?  You can ask.  Yes, sir.  Jim, is this what you were upset about yesterday?  No.  It was unrelated.  This would have made me slightly excited.  What?  Why is he trying to connect the two?  I'm confused.  He's gone?  No, sir.  Okay.  If they transfer across the GW, then they're moving a minor over state lines for a sex crime? 
[00:38:00]  That's a man-ass.  Driving through people's backyards.  Knocking down mailboxes.  Got a girl in the car.  I was black in two.  Let's go to Bobby in the Bronx.  Bobby.  What's up, boys?  It's Bobby, the cop from the Bronx.  Yeah, what's up, Bobby?  Hey, one thing I was talking about, and I heard you hit on it there, is if they transported her across the GW Bridge, because, I mean, she originated in the Bronx. 
[00:38:30]  Sure.  Those are federal charges.  Even though you're only in Jersey for, you know, ten minutes, those are federal charges.  You're moving a minor across state lines, you know, for a...  That's a man-ass.  We just did that.  Her ass was wiggling, too.  Nice ass.  Thank you, nice lady.  But a minor over state lines, that's like Georgia to Florida, not New York to Jersey.  All you gotta do is cross those state lines, man.  I mean, come on.  Yeah, but to us, you know, that live up here, New York, Jersey, Connecticut, it's all starting to look the same to us. 
[00:39:00]  Give me a Diablos sandwich and a Dr. Pepper and a hookah.  Give me a black eye and a rape charge and make it fast.  I'm in a goddamn hurry.  Yeah.  All right.  Touch it now, Blake.  You guys don't think state lines up here, do you?  You know what I mean?  When you go from New York to Jersey, you don't even notice.  When you go New York to Connecticut at this point, you don't really notice.  No. 
[00:39:30]  But if you're in the Midwest or down South, you know when you're passing state lines.  They got all sorts of big signs and everything.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Ralph in Jersey.  Ralph.  There's insurmountable evidence against LT.  Apparently, they found both his Super Bowl rings on the nightstand.  I mean, and they weren't on the nightstand.  Fucking boom.  He's trying to recover.  Let's listen.  Oh, he hung up. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, yuck.  He didn't hang up.  That's what happens to your phone when you crash at 1,000 miles an hour.  Hopefully, his phone blew up like the Israelis did to that.  Hopefully, he fucking blew his head off.  Someone hit a code and his head blew up.  Oh, did he screw that up.  He was going old school and completely fucked it up.  The old high school ring and the vagina joke.  Both of his rings.  Oh, we got it?  Let's listen again.  Let's see.  Ralph.  There's insurmountable evidence against LT. 
[00:40:30]  Apparently, they found both his Super Bowl rings on the nightstand.  I mean, and they weren't on the nightstand.  I love when we do forensics on somebody's bomb.  Oh, you know what?  We have to play it again because I picked up on something else.  Yeah.  The confidence.  Oh, at first.  Listen for the confidence now.  Both of his Super Bowl rings.  Like he's doing a late night monologue with his hands in his pocket. 
[00:41:00]  He's so confident.  He's leaning toward the camera a little bit.  Here it comes, folks.  This guy's Jay Leso.  Listen for the confidence now as we play it again.  Let's say hi to Ralph.  Especially apparently.  There's insurmountable evidence against LT.  Apparently, they found both his Super Bowl rings on the nightstand.  I mean, and they weren't on the nightstand. 
[00:41:30]  Insurmountable was the beginning of his fucking horrible.  The confidence.  How he says apparently.  That's the monologue of Jimmy Fallon.  What's a monologue?  A monologue.  A monologue.  The monologue.  Did I even say monologue?  Wow.  Can you rewind that for a minute?  Oh, my God.  Now we're just.  I just want to hear if Anthony said a monologue.  You know, Jimmy Fallon.  Jimmy Fallon was funny, too.  I should have.  Jimmy Fallon.  I just want to hear if Anthony said monologue. 
[00:42:00]  Mm-hmm.  I love how we have to chew each other apart like this.  It's just great.  Oh, it is.  It's what you're doing.  Okay, here it is.  Insurmountable was the beginning of his fucking horrible.  Oh, man.  The confidence.  How he says apparently.  Apparently.  The monologue of Jimmy Fallon.  Money log.  Money log.  I did say money log.  I said money log.  Yeah, see?  Meh.  Money log.  Oh.  You, the money log. 
[00:42:30]  Guys, we got a terrific line coming in right here.  Oh, cool, cool.  Yeah, this is going to be a really good one.  Bill on Long Island.  Bill?  Oh, Bill.  Hey, you guys.  How are you?  Hi, Bill.  What's up, Bill?  Well, I'm pretty proud of LP.  He broke a sports record.  Oh, really?  He can't.  He's the only professional sports player that's gone from Dancing with the Stars to Dancing  with the Stripes.  Your phone cut out, dude. 
[00:43:00]  He's the only pro sports athlete that's gone from Dancing with the Stars to Dancing with  the Stripes.  He's the only pro athlete who went from Dancing with the Stars where?  It might be.  I'm sorry, go ahead.  Dancing with the Stripes.  What about the Stripes?  Dancing with the Stripes.  What is that?  He was on Dancing with the Stars.  He keeps cutting out.  He was on Dancing with the Stars.  Yeah.  What's the other thing, though?  I didn't see that show. 
[00:43:30]  I feel like Conan No Brian.  Try it again, though.  That's a good one.  He went from...  What is No Brian?  Just do the thing over, dude, and just make sure your phone is not cutting out because  it's probably on our end.  Do it without, like, stopping because when you stop, it gates out and we can't hear it.  How do you make sure your phone doesn't cut out?  Yeah, you just got to hold it steady.  Oh, okay.  Okay, go ahead.  One more time.  Sorry, dude.  Yeah.  He's going from Dancing with the Stars to Dancing with the Stars. 
[00:44:00]  We heard you!  Right.  How many times are you going to tell us?  Oh, for the love of God, we heard you.  You're Conan No Brian.  What?  What does that mean?  Just changing a word doesn't make it.  You're Bonin, are we?  You're George Nopez.  It doesn't make sense. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, you're David, you're David number man.  David Lettercant.  All right.  It doesn't make sense.  I know, it'll be Lettercant.  Bill, thank you.  Thank you, Bill.  Thank you.  Yeah, thanks a lot, Bill.  Let's go to Vegas.  Let's see if we have better luck in Vegas.  Steve.  Oh, you're a mackerel.  Good evening.  Hi, Steve.  Hello.  I just want to say, this poor girl sitting in the car, she has this option.  She can either get beat by a pimp or fucked by Lawrence Taylor.  Yeah, that's a rough decision, man.  Exactly.  What do you do?  He's got to get your panties wet just thinking about it. 
[00:45:00]  What do you do?  What do you do?  Apparently both.  Yeah.  Greg on Long Island.  Hey.  I heard that from somewhere that Lawrence Taylor was being watched since Monday.  They waited until he got on the plane.  All right.  All right.  So he made one mistake this week.  You fucking asshole.  Oh, this guy.  That was a big mistake, though.  Oh, you fucking guy.  All right.  Well, this guy, Christian in Indiana.  Christian. 
[00:45:30]  Hey, boys.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey, I got to say, I agree with the other caller.  This is such a shut up, man.  This is so shut up.  You know, if you look at your theories, the guy could go back to jail for 10 years for parole,  but he's going to get out in five.  I mean, who wouldn't do five years for a million dollars?  What is this a movie?  Yeah, dude.  You don't go into the jerk for five years to come out and get some kind of settlement  money that a hooker is supposed to fucking take care of for you. 
[00:46:00]  And hold for you.  And put an IRA.  And it's set up by a pimp.  What is LT doing hanging out with pimps?  I don't know, man.  I just think that it was set up and this chick is going to get some money.  And once he gets out, this chick is going to give the pimp money.  No, I don't believe you, sir.  Maybe the pimp knew it was LT and made the girl go up there like, we're going to get this  guy on something.  And it went bad.  Maybe he didn't know the girl texted her uncle.  Because they said this girl was living with this guy in the Bronx.  Like, they met. 
[00:46:30]  She had moved out of her relative's house.  And so she was staying with this guy in the Bronx.  And then he was making her lap dances.  And now he was making her fuck for money.  So, obviously, she probably just wanted this whole stuff over with.  And maybe he wanted to just take care of LT, thinking, holy crap, I got a nice new client  for my young girl here.  That's right.  So maybe he was thinking, I'm going to get a few rounds with this LT.  Maybe, yeah.  Maybe he wanted to make him happy and give him a nice young piece of ass.  Plus, he might be a Giants fan from back in the day. 
[00:47:00]  That's my point, though, man.  You got all these Johns out there.  It just so happens it's going to be LT.  Come on.  Well, it happens.  It happens, dude.  He's just a guy.  He's LT.  It's not the fucking Dalai Lama.  And it's looking like he had sex with a girl.  So if it was a setup.  Well, apparently, they found.  He should have smelled that it was a setup.  Apparently, they found his Super Bowl trophy.  And it was not on his night.  Wait, it was in her cervix nightstand.  Hey, just out of curiosity, real quick.  How long have you guys been off CBS? 
[00:47:30]  Oh, a while, bro.  Yeah, a while, man.  Well, over a year, right?  About a year.  Well, I've been out of pocket for a while.  So I was just curious.  Yeah, stick with satellite, man.  Yeah, 13 months about.  Wow.  That's how long already?  Yeah, it's been a while.  I fucking, I wiped that out like a childhood rape memory.  That fucking, oh, that nightmare of, don't say this.  All right, boys.  Jimmy, you love your books, man.  Thank you, buddy.  I appreciate it.  Let me go to Stryker in Denver, right, Stryker?  Yeah, something like that. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  Denver area.  Yeah.  Hey, Anthony, you know, if LT was like you and had the Age of Consent iPhone app, he would  have known she was illegal.  Exactly.  You've got to know what state you're in.  I love the iPhone.  Now he'll be another little dot on the sexual predator map.  Yeah, but what do you do?  I mean, you know, it's a dot, but it's LT.  You're like, oh, wow, I'm living near LT.  That's kind of cool. 
[00:48:30]  That's pretty cool.  We're going to Japan.  Holy shit.  Brad in Japan.  Hey, hello, guys.  What the fuck is up?  What are you doing in Japan?  I'm a United States Marine.  Oh, all right.  Right on.  What time is it?  It is right now 7.11 p.m.  Or 7.50 p.m.  I'm sorry.  They still scared of you guys over there?  They look at you and think like, oh, boy.  Oh, boy. 
[00:49:00]  I like to scare them.  Wait, it's 7.50?  What day is it?  It's still Friday until 12 o'clock.  It'll be Saturday morning.  Oh, so you're at least in the same day.  It's like Friday night for him.  I love talking to the future people.  Yeah.  It's Friday night now.  But it is Friday night right now, so it is kind of the future.  I consider it future when it's now Saturday somewhere.  What happens?  And they call our show.  What happens today at like 5 o'clock in the afternoon? 
[00:49:30]  What happened?  I drove to Naha Airport to pick up one of my Marine's parents.  Ah, Naha.  Can I ask a question?  How did you at first say it's 7.11 and they go, oh, no, 7.50?  How did you mix up two ones with a five and a zero?  Because I was fucking looking at the clock and waiting on the phone for fucking 30 minutes.  Oh, excuse me.  Excuse me.  It's all good.  It's all good.  He's calling the wrong distance. 
[00:50:00]  I'm on Skype.  I get the fucking unlimited.  Oh, what a guy.  All right.  So you can hang on the phone for a while.  What's that?  What do you need?  What's that, buddy?  Do you get some of that Japanese pussy?  Yeah, I make little Japos fucking cry.  Some of that sideways pussy?  I wish it was sideways.  That's what I thought the first time I came out here it would be sideways.  But they lied to me.  Yeah, I really thought so. 
[00:50:30]  I was young and dumb.  But I wanted to let you all know that it's been a while since I listened to you all.  And I'm probably going to have the first WOW sticker in Okinawa, Japan.  I'm going to get a picture for you all.  All right.  Do you have a WOW sticker?  One of my buddies is sending it out right now.  Actually, I'd like to give him a shout out.  What's up, Mike Schaefer?  All right, good.  I know you're listening to it.  All right, Brad.  All the way from Japan.  All right.  All right.  All right.  There you go.  Have fun.  I saw Japan. 
[00:51:00]  I said, what the hell?  Why don't we talk to Japan?  Yeah, why not?  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  It's a gesture game. Let's do it in a sense. 
[00:51:30]  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  I have a bad case of diarrhea.  Just playing it to get it stuck in your head, that's all.  It really does.  It came out of nowhere, I understand.  Embed itself in there.  My goal is to get that stuck in your head all weekend long.  Yeah, it really does.  Somebody sent that to me on Twitter last night.  I'll give you credit when I find your tweet again.  The video is pretty good, too, I guess.  All right, we want to take our first break in.  Oh, God. 
[00:52:00]  It's the last day.  What?  Taking a break, and it's the last day.  See that pile over there?  Oh, shit.  You should get an award today.  Oh, my God.  It's just been amazing.  How many today?  How many we got, Danny?  13 Mother's Day reads?  There might be something else in there.  I doubt it.  Danny just shakes his head no.  All right.

We give you a bunch of choices, as a matter of fact.  Yeah.  Because one person's great Mother's Day gift is not another person's.  They might think something else is great.  And we give you a smorgasbord of things to get Mom.  Oh, yeah.  In three hours, speaking of Mother's Day, what a gift I have for you.  Yes.  Oh.  Borgata tickets on sale in three hours for July 2nd and 3rd. 
[00:53:00]  Second and 3rd.  The Borgata.com.  Yes.  And they go on sale what time?  10 a.m.  10 a.m.  Three hours from now.  What a party that's going to be.  Yeah, I'm actually looking forward to that one.  Yeah.  We could all get together and make love after the show.  Well, no.  We don't need to do that.  Why not?  We'll watch your fine show.  Bunch of men holding each other's forms.  No, the show will be good enough.  Making love.  No, that's all right.  Watch me walk away from a blackjack table and spit on the floor.  This is the best part of doing the Borgata is they always go, yeah, Hope's here. 
[00:53:30]  But Ant might come, but I'm like, he's not.  He's not showing.  I don't know Anthony loves me.  I don't take it personally.  He's hooked.  It's okay.  I've actually been to the Borgata when you were playing there and didn't go to the show.  You've been in the fucking dressing room and not gone to the show.  That's easy, though.  I was very busy.  I was on a roll.  Yeah, he hears jingling and he's like, I'll be right back.  No, you won't.  I was trying to listen to it.  Ching, ching, ching, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  I always know where to find him.  It's okay.  Yeah.  It is okay.  I'm on the floor. 
[00:54:00]  Anthony's not sure if he can sell the seats.  He's not going to be here.  Sell the seats.  I don't want a big hole in the middle of the room or whatever.  Hey, why don't we go to break?  I am terrible.  We're going to go to break with the Side Pussy song.  I don't think we played it a lot this week.  That is a good time.  Oh, Patrice.  Where's Patrice tonight?  Is he doing a gig or no?  I don't know.  We'll figure it out after the break.  There's too much going on.  Troy Kwan's tribute to Patrice.  It's called Side Pussy as we go to break.  You don't fuck a bitch who thinks she can be number one. 
[00:54:30]  I cheat on my girl.  It's with fat bitches that know what my girl look like and go, number two is good.  Even number three.  Three, three, three, three, three.  I've been saying, look, I'm a decent motherfucker.  It's because I want some side pussy.  It's because I want other pussy as opposed to yours doesn't make me evil.  Dudes want side pussy.  You're never going to meet a girl whose timing ain't broken.  You know what I'm saying?  I said a pussy smell like mini burgers.  Ooh, your girl looks better than me.  I got no self-esteem. 
[00:55:00]  You're side pussy.  Damn, you got some nice titties.  Ooh, to put it smoothly.  I'm cool with number three.  You're side pussy.  Don't be such a pussy.  Go get some side.  What women do have to understand is that we look.  That's a part of our soul.  We don't bleed every month.  We don't fucking sit down to pee.  We don't pop babies out.  The one thing that we suffer with is when we're committed.  And women should understand what commitment is.  It's a commitment to us, not commitment to them. 
[00:55:30]  It's a commitment that I can be not a piece of shit one day in my life.  Um, that it doesn't solve the problem of strange twat everywhere.  One side pussy.  We don't have the tools to fight young, delicious women.  That's safe.  Patrice, I'm going to fuck you bad.  First of all, any bitch who doesn't want her asshole licked is an asshole.  Side pussy.  Pussy.  Side pussy.  Don't be such a pussy.  Go get some sides. 
[00:56:00]  Ooh, take it from me.  My ass is a guarantee.  Your side pussy.  You hear how delicious that sounded?  Ooh, I'll be your fucky.  I'm not too hard to believe.  Your side pussy.  Don't be such a pussy.  Go get some sides.  That's how Harlem got hooked on heroin in the 20s.  They give you the uncut dope, and then as soon as you go,  they go, got you, you punk motherfucker. 
[00:56:30]  That's what they do.  And it's not their fault.  It's not malicious.  It's just nature.  That's what they do.  They can't help it.  Nigga, what are you talking about?  Dudes want side pussy.  Pussy.  Ooh, we'll tell anyone that we get our fuck going twice a week.  Hey, can I lick your asshole?  Ooh, your girl looks better than me.  But I'm more nasty.  Ooh, your side pussy.  That's what I say to the milkman, nigga. 
[00:57:00]  Ooh, I want to fuck you bad Patrice.  How you gonna say no to me?  Your side pussy.  Don't be such a pussy.  Go get some side.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.

Yeah, this F.U. is going out to my friend Trevor.  It was so pussy whipped that when I asked him to come see Jay Moore of Governors, 
[00:58:00]  his first response was, let me see if my girlfriend wants to go.  Hey, dude, let me give you some advice, Jay.  You didn't have to ask her if she wanted to go.  You should have asked her for your balls back.  Fuck you.  Next message.  I just wanted to say a big fuck you to that live view GPS shit.  At night, I have sex at my mom's office with my girlfriend in my car.  My mom low jacked that shit, fucking came to the office, and saw my bare ass in the window. 
[00:58:30]  I'm grounded.  Fuck you.  Next message.  I'd like to leave this message to get a big F.U. to my stepdaughter's mother.  All she's done is make our life a living hell and then turned around and blamed us for it.  She's the biggest cunt I've ever known.  Next message.  She doesn't like to say fuck you to clowns.  They don't make shakes anymore.  Now they know that they're just big white gobs of nothing.  End of new messages.  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line, 866-FU-LINE-1. 
[00:59:00]  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you and goodbye.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show is now back.  On this virus.  Sirius XM.  I just want to listen to the Stones now.  I know, right? 
[00:59:30]  Ah.  Ah, you're supposed to kick in right there.  I know, I know, I know.  Never does.  So, Tyra Banks, there's a clip going around.  She's enraging.  She's almost done with her TV career, I believe.  Think that's it?  I think so, yeah.  I think it's just about done.  She should be acting, you think?  She's good.  I don't know what else she's going to do.  Yeah.  I think Wendy Williams is stealing her thunder.  Oh, absolutely.  Absolutely.  When Wendy walks.  I think they pretty much canceled. 
[01:00:00]  Thunder when she walks because kaboom, kaboom.  What's something?  I didn't even, I'm looking at a Ron Jeremy post.  I honestly did not hear you.  Good.  Never mind.  What are you talking about, Wendy Williams?  Of course.  Two W's.  You know, if they're three W's, you're going to go like, ooh, ooh, ooh.  Do you know there's a Facebook page dedicated to Chip?  Is there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Chip is a sensation. 
[01:00:30]  Everyone hates to admit it.  Chip's a sensation.  Of course he is.  Lyle Chip Chipperson.  It's good.  My name, don't wear it out.  That's a good one.  All right.  Tyra Banks.  Yeah.  Tyra Banks.  Is she almost done with her stupid show, right?  Didn't they cancel it?  But she's still doing episodes until the contract's up or the season's up.  Official last season.  Was it canceled or did she walk, you think?  She says she walked, I think.  Ah, bullshit.  Is she losing ratings? 
[01:01:00]  I think they were expecting it to do better than it was.  She was supposed to be the young Oprah and it just never panned out.  Do you think Wendy Williams hurt her by coming all of a sudden from Chip Chipperson's Facebook?  This guy's handsome.  Look at that.  It's a male model or something.  That's me.  I wonder if Wendy Williams coming on the scene really took a lot of the audience Tyra wanted.  Because Wendy Williams doesn't seem like a phony like Tyra. 
[01:01:30]  Like, I think that she's much more engaging.  Yeah, she's more down to earth.  Yeah.  People can relate to Wendy Williams than a Tyra Banks who had it easy her entire life.  Yeah.  You know?  But there's a clip going around.  People don't believe that this clip is real, right?  Yeah.  Get the fuck out of here.  I mean, well, I don't know if anybody actually believes that or believed it for a second.  But Tyra's thing was that she was, like, surprised that nobody came out and helped her.  Really?  Yeah.  She thought her acting was so good. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  That she would have convinced people that there was an issue.  So she didn't tell anyone she was doing this?  I guess not.  I mean, some people on her staff would have known.  But the audience certainly didn't know.  She is so fucking hateable.  Wow, is she a fucking hateable person.  She really is.  And watching her, first of all, she's dressed, she should be in the fucking McCartney,  Michael Jackson video.  Say, say, say.  She is dressed like that.  With the elixirs.  Suspenders. 
[01:02:30]  A tie.  A pink shirt.  A man's tie.  And fucking, like, what are they called?  Capris.  Capris.  She's wearing capris like our own Steve Seawar.  Steve Seawar loves.  Yeah.  And her acting is so terrible.  She's fucking terrible.  She's delusional.  She thinks she's a good actor or actress.  She thinks people should have ran to her aid because she was doing such a good job.  She thought this bit was really good.  Maybe she thought, because the career is ending as far as the talk show, that she can now  just pretty much audition during her show. 
[01:03:00]  She released this clip before the show aired because she thought it was so good it would  get a strong buzz going through Tyra's show again.  A little viral?  No, she didn't.  She thought so.  She didn't think this would...  She is fucking terrible.  I can't even be funny.  She's terrible.  Yeah, she really is.  It's enraging, right?  Ugh!  I mean, geez.  All right, well, let's play this.  Well, she comes limping out onto stage.  Yeah.  And then presents this to her audience.  Yes. 
[01:03:30]  She's rubbing her right thigh.  Yeah.  Her audience is excited to see her.  She looks a little off.  Her feet are pointed in.  Everybody, Maya!  Dump feet.  First of all, I want to apologize to everybody.  I'm not 100% today.  I'm not feeling great.  None of you ever.  I jog a lot in my neighborhood, and I was jogging today with some friends around my neighborhood.  You know you're not 100%.  A friggin' dog bit me.  Tell me.  Yeah.  He bit me, like, right here. 
[01:04:00]  Can you pause this?  So it's like a little...  The first mistake.  When she comes out on stage, she's limping on her left leg.  Yeah, yeah.  And now she's pointing to her right leg where the fucking dog bit her.  She can't even get that part of the bit right.  She was leaning on her leg like the left one was hurting.  Yeah.  Maybe she's been favoring her right leg so that her left leg has been worked out more,  and so now her left leg is sore.  That must be it.  That's it, Sam.  That's it, Sam. 
[01:04:30]  She's like, the dog bit me.  What happened was they weren't jogging.  She said, I was on my back, and we were trying to apply oven mitts to the animal.  Why does it always have to be done?  And he bit me.  And as I was smearing the jiffy, it fell.  Is it jiff or jiffy peanut butter?  It's jiff.  Jiff.  I suck today.  Why?  Why?  Maybe she was in an oil change place trying to get her pussy licked.  I suck today.  You don't?  I tell you, it's the reeds.  They're taking their toll.  It's all right. 
[01:05:00]  You don't get any breaks.  It's okay, sweetie.  It's okay.  Yeah.  Well, she's going to do her mini-log.  Oh, she's fucking terrible.  So she was favoring the left leg, but now she's showing everyone that she got bit on the right  leg while jogging in her neighborhood.  Weird right now.  I had to get rushed to the hospital, and then the doctors are like, well, did the dog look  different, you know, like crazy or anything?  And I'm like, well, he was angry, and he, you know, was like salivating.  And they're like, okay, was it like foamy salivating? 
[01:05:30]  Or was it?  And I'm like, well, it was kind of foamy, and then they tested me, and the dog has rabies  and had to get a shot.  Thank God it's not 20 years ago.  If it was 20, 30 years ago, I would...  You wouldn't have a show.  It would be really, really bad.  I'm feeling a little weird, but I'm okay.  I'm just thirsty.  So can we pause for a second?  Can I have some water?  I'm sorry.  Oh.  She turns around.  She turns around and...  I can't show the name of the bottle.  She can't show the audience the name of the bottle because it's a sponsor issue, you see? 
[01:06:00]  That's why she has to have her back to the cameras.  What is she doing?  This is so embarrassing.  Like a bad comedian doing an impression.  She turned her back to the audience.  And then walking silently to the interview area with her mouth shut.  Oh, she's...  And she's like...  She has some fluid in her mouth.  Oh, is she...  Wait, can you pause this?  Because we've got to explain to the audience.  Explain.  So she drinks the water, 
[01:06:30]  and then she kind of staggers to her chair  because she's got to interview someone for her show.  The audience is like,  what the fuck's going on?  Then she's kind of like,  she doesn't look quite right.  And next thing you know,  her mouth starts foaming.  She starts clutching her stomach.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And now she's just...  It looks like a cum shot.  It really does.  Someone's got to...  Someone's got to Photoshop a big fucking penis  on the right side of that picture.  Now foam is coming out of her mouth.  Some audience members, I must say,  do look concerned, 
[01:07:00]  but they are completely retarded.  Oh.  Yeah, if you're buying this,  you're completely retarded.  They're probably like,  what is this fucking bitch doing?  Yeah, they look more perplexed than concerned.  How many people are thinking,  I took the day off for this?  It's a bunch of Asian girls.  I took a day off for this,  taping for this?  There's people laughing,  like, I get it.  Yeah.  All right, hit it.  Oh, no.  And she's on the ground, 
[01:07:30]  foaming at them off,  trying to scare her audience  like she's a zombie,  making believe she's trying to bite them.  Oh, my God.  We're pranking you today!  Start the show!  She drooled all over the...  Oh, she here?  We're pranking you today.  Tyra pranks.  It's a prank.  She doesn't have rabies.  She did not say Tyra pranks. 
[01:08:00]  That's what she just said.  Tyra pranks.  What?  She said,  we're pranking you today.  Tyra pranks.  Look at the poor audience member  that she went over to and bit.  Now has drool  all over her sweater.  I'm going to see Tyra Banks outfit.  I could have had you shot for that.  She is fucking terrible.  How does she ever...  How does she have anything?  Does she have anything?  Because she had a really nice set of fucking boobs. 
[01:08:30]  She's fucking...  When she was modeling.  Now they're her writers.  Yeah.  You look at those young pictures of Tyra Banks.  That's why.  Fuck, man.  She's just stuck with modeling.  That is so bad.  It's so embarrassing.  I literally couldn't look at it.  I was humiliated for her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You threw the mic and...  God.  You were almost on the floor.  It's not funny or engaging or real.  It's fucking...  Embarrassing dreck.  See...  Can't show the bottle of water.  Really?  Where's the prank? 
[01:09:00]  Especially since she said,  can we pause for a second?  Which means she's trying to trick the studio audience  into thinking that this portion won't be on television.  Yeah.  So then why would she have to turn around  if they're not going to put this part on?  Why would they show her drinking the water on television?  If she can't show the bottle of water,  it's like it's paused.  So who cares?  Who cares?  Why would you turn around?  Yeah.  Why do you face away?  Why not just put it in the glass?  Don't they know that you're going to be thirsty?  Just peel the label off.  Put duct tape over it.  There's so many different things you could do.  No, but then she couldn't put the Alka-Seltzer in the bottle. 
[01:09:30]  Or whatever was in the bottle.  In her mouth or whatever.  I'm thinking the bottle was filled with cum.  You think it was jizzled?  Yeah, I think so.  It's dog cum.  Yeah, dog cum.  How great would that be if it came out  if it was actually St. Bernard cum?  Now there's a problem with PETA.  They were milking a St. Bernard  until his penis was all sore and chafed.  Until they could fill up the water bottle.  And then she was supposed to do a prank show.  Like, she was supposed to do all these  talk about pranks on the show.  But when the show aired,  it was supposed to air on April 30th 
[01:10:00]  and they just put a rerun on.  They didn't air the show.  Probably.  It was so bad.  They just scrapped it?  What are the pranks worth there, you think?  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  You can only imagine.  Now I need to see the whole show.  I know.  I wanted it so badly.  Maybe there was some tripwire involved or something.  Somebody tripping.  I don't know.  She was able to get a cab.  You know, because...  Right.  Maybe she finally had fucking  some type of plugs  put into that balding head of hers. 
[01:10:30]  How great is it  to be a fucking model  and have a head like Lou Gossett?  Shined in forehead.  Oh, that fucking massive skull.  Looks like a Klingon.  Her fucking hair.  Exactly.  She has hair like the guy  that tortured Mel Gibson  in the original Lethal Weapon.  He has forgotten more about torture  than you and I will ever learn.  Chen, whatever his name was.  Oh, her hairline fucking blows.  Real funny wharf.  Yeah, her fucking forehead is brutal.  Well, there you go.  There's the tire clip.  You don't think there's any future 
[01:11:00]  in the Tyra Pranks brand?  No.  Tyra Pranks.  No.  No.  Not at all.  Lady Gaga.  Gaga at MoMA.  Yeah.  What's she doing?  Apparently she was at that,  you know that exhibit  where they were standing there naked?  Yeah.  She wasn't naked,  but she went to the exhibit  and just sat at a table for a while.  So, like, she was part of the exhibit  and people didn't know.  Oh, she got to inject herself into that?  What's the matter?  Well.  Album sales dipping a little bit?  What's going on?  No.  No.  I know. 
[01:11:30]  I bought it for Christ's sake.  God.  I had to.  God damn it, it is good.  I told you.  Months ago.  A year ago I told you.  So what?  Who didn't?  Exactly.  Bong, bong, bong, bong, bong, bong, bong, bong, bong, bong, bong, bong, bong, bong,  gong, gong, gong, gong, gong, gong, gong, gong, gong.  I got my tickets for July at the garden.  All right, I wouldn't do that, but she is fucking, uh, Jesus Christ.  I don't, for what, for the kind of music it is, it is, what's the other one too?  Alejandro!  Come on.  Alejandro, that's the new, yeah, that's the new single.  Come on. 
[01:12:00]  Uh, Travis?  Yeah, I don't know.  Little Alejandro, if you will.  It's a hit, right?  Yeah, it'll be number one.  I thought Telephone was the hit.  I don't like that one.  Telephone is right now and Alejandro is the new one.  Telephone was number one.  Bad Romance.  Every single she's put out has gone to number one.  And it's all from the same album?  Well, she released an EP to go with her album, so it's like a double album now.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  She's going to go gold or something, you know?  I hear she's very angry at...  What show is she angry at? 
[01:12:30]  American Idol.  Oh, American Idol, right.  They cut out a minute and a half of her performance because it's like six minutes long.  Very angry.  Six minutes long.  There's fire and netting and trees.  But they are idiots, though.  It's like she is the biggest thing in music right now.  What are you cutting any of the performance for?  That's stupid.  Biggest thing, her clip.  I love it, dude.  I want to throw it over my shoulder and carry it like a lumberjack and then smell it.  This is Alejandro. 
[01:13:00]  Here's what I like about her.  She's actually, for this kind of music to have any kind of original sound is a miracle.  It's true.  Yeah.  I'm dancing.  Yeah, you're already dancing.  Can't help but move, Ant.  I'm dancing.  To your natural half African-American heritage.  I love you, boy.  Hot like Mexico.  Rejoys. 
[01:13:30]  At this point, I've got to choose nothing to do.  Here we go.  It's a little Ace of Base-ish.  Yes.  You're right.  But that's okay.  I wouldn't even know that.  That's okay.  All right.  You didn't hit the chorus yet.  Oh, no?  No.  Here it comes.  What does that mean?  Some guy's big unclipped cock. 
[01:14:00]  It's probably some fucking, some guy with washboard abs who looks like the guy from Rent Boy who  probably gave her an eight by six uncut deep dicking.  Lady Gaga.  I'm not feeling that one.  It's going to be number one.  I think you're right, Sam.  I don't know.  You don't hit number one.  They always do.  It does sound like I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I just said that. 
[01:14:30]  I saw the sign.  It's all right.  I saw the signs.  Remember her?  What happened to her?  What happened to her?  What happened to her?  Where'd she go?  I don't know, but I saw the sign.  I thought of her recently.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Like, I liked, oh, the song was on, like, Hits or something, or whatever, or it was on  the 80s channel, and I fucking thought of her version and not the song.  I want to hear her version.  Yeah, I do, too.  I really want to hear her version.  I saw the sign.  Saw the sign.  I got it.  I don't know where it is.  We haven't played in so long.  Life is demanding without understanding. 
[01:15:00]  She was terrible.  Travis, you got it?  You got the long version?  I saw the sign.  Yes.  Pamela?  All right.  Was her name?  Here we go.  Yeah.  She rolled.  Turn this up.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I got a new life. 
[01:15:30]  You would hardly recognize me.  I'm so glad I'm a new person.  I hear you.  We leave you.  I don't bother.  You're not the one for me.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Is it not enough?  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes. 
[01:16:00]  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding.  Without understanding.  I saw the sign.  It opened up my eyes.  That's all the sign.  No one's going to drag you up.  To get into the light where you belong.  Come here till you belong.  She kicks ass.  Oh.  There's more, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Good.  Two minutes.  Good.  Love this dummy.  All right.  I got a new game. 
[01:16:30]  There's any fears of wanting who you are.  I'm too person.  Like you.  Bring me joy.  I'm in a pale moon where I see a lot of stars.  Ooh.  Is it not enough?  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding.  Without understanding.  I saw the sign. 
[01:17:00]  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  No one's going to drag you up.  To get into the light where you belong.  But where do you belong?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  There's a little Poe there.  Oh.  Wow. 
[01:17:30]  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  And I am happy not living without you.  I left you.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I saw the sign.  It opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  No one's going to drag you up.  To get into the light where you belong.  Sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign. 
[01:18:00]  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  It's better than the original.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Sign.  Sign.  Sign.  Yeah.  That helps.  How great is that?  I haven't heard that.  It's been so fucking long.  Steven S. from Bayshore is trying to spell it.  He goes, now I want to hear I saw the sign.  Okay.  Which we played.  He spells sign.  S-O-Y-N.

We got to try to relocate her and see what she's doing.  These days.  I think she.  I don't know if she won.  If she won.  She won a MacBook for that.  Oh really?  That was MacBook Karaoke.  Maybe she's Lady Gaga now.  We got to bring back something.  Call it something karaoke.  We got to do that again.  Let's do it.  Yeah.

Well, if they could get a Mac, that would be great.  A nice Mac Pro or something.  We got to bring the karaoke bit back.  Diamond encrusted Steven Singer iPod.

I'm getting reports here that there is a Bobo breakdancing video. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, yes.  Uh, yeah, Nerd, Pharrell's hip-hop group, was in studio last week sometime.  When Bobo was here last week, they were here.  Yeah.  And so, Troy played some Nerd over at his workstation, and there's a lot of area there.  Yeah.  And Bobo came over and claimed that he liked the song, so he started dancing to it, and  E-Rock filmed him and put it on his Twitter last night.  Oh, no. 
[01:21:00]  E-Rock Radio, if you want to check this out.  Yeah, Twitter slash E-Rock Radio.  E-Rock do it.  Yeah, how is he doing?  How is he?  I miss him.  I don't know.  How is he doing?  Well, he won't talk to me?  He's still not talking to you, Sam.  Well, you took his money.  Right, so I don't know.  Aren't you guys kind of friends and stuff?  Why isn't he talking to you?  Apparently, our friendship was worth approximately $500.  Is he hot under the collar?  Very much so.  Yeah, he's very angry.  All right, opening there for Bobo dancing.  I like the music.  Oh, he put in some other music.  Oh, my God.  Bobo's trying to be all gangster and dance with a hoodie on, and his meth hat, of course. 
[01:21:30]  He's just, he looks like one of those retards dancing at the retard prom that we watched.  Does he get on the floor?  No.  Oh, wow.  Sam's fucking busting some moves with him.  Well, he started slowing down, so.  All right.  That's just sad.  What do you mean?  He's having a good time.  No, he's not. 
[01:22:00]  It is just sad.  You're right.  He's got moves.  He's doing the same move over and over again.  Of course he is.  The fetal alcohol syndrome move.  Wow.  Got the rhythm of a blown engine.  Wiggling his ass.  His ass is wiggling, too.  Like a robot.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, there he goes.  He's doing that thing with his arms where it looks like a wave. 
[01:22:30]  The snake, where a wave is going right through your body from one arm to another.  Boy, the way this guy dances, and they should have wanted to go to a dance club again.  Oh, jeez, kid.  Running man.  Oh, he's on the floor.  There he goes.  Oh, he's spinning.  He's doing like the crab walk on the floor.  How does he do that?  What is he doing?  Oh, my God.  Oh, he's, okay, thrusting against the floor.  Oh, that's the worm.  Oh, the worm.  Thank you.  Oh, now he's the running man again. 
[01:23:00]  He's just running in place.  I hate this video.  I don't need a bodyguard.  And then a high five.  A high five.  He's a retard.  Oh, you made it, Jimmy.  Thank you, I think that's inaccurate.  Is our intern wearing lingerie under that shirt?  Oh, no.  Let's get that sweetie in here.  What's he doing?  He just brought coffee, and he's the emo guy who thinks he's, what, sad?  But he doesn't really know what that emotion is.  His girlfriend's fucked him up and everything.  Dude, what the hell are you wearing? 
[01:23:30]  Are you wearing lingerie on?  Do you have a ponytail in?  What are you doing?  How was your trip with Dr. George Reckers?  That's the same guy.  I know.  You're kind of the rent boy kid.  You got a rent boy look going to you.  Is that the gay prostitute?  Yeah, this guy.  Yeah.  Steve C. was trying to convince him of all the money that rent boys get paid.  I'm not kidding.  Steve would know, huh?  Steve was telling him that straight men get paid thousands and thousands of dollars to 
[01:24:00]  do gay sex scenes.  I don't know if he was propositioning him.  Why don't you look a lot like that guy?  You could be one of those guys.  Why don't you go into gay escort service, gay pornography, something like that?  That would piss off your girlfriend.  If I didn't have it.  It's a hell of a way to get back at her.  If I didn't have such a strong support system, I'd...  Yeah, you'd go for it.  That sounds tempting.  But you say you're not gay.  It's a lot of money, yeah, probably.  You could probably make a lot of money being an emo twink or something. 
[01:24:30]  If you're at the bottom of, like...  Bottom.  You'd be at the bottom, all right.  Yeah.  Face buried in the pillow.  What are you wearing underneath?  Nothing.  No, it was like a...  It's a strap.  What's that strap?  No, it just got ripped this morning.  Wow.  Oh, your neckline of your shirt is kind of ripped.  He's just a wild man, this kid.  It's very fashionable, Opie.  You don't know fashion.  It looked like he was wearing a bra or something, but it's just the collar was ripped up?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who ripped it?  My girlfriend.  Oh, shit.  Ex-girlfriend. 
[01:25:00]  Why does she rip it?  Wait, Sam, before we get into the update, for the people out there, you know, they can't  listen to the whole goddamn show every day, so what the fuck's going on with Sean?  Well, Sean and his girlfriend are in a very toxic relationship.  At one point, she was with other men.  They were technically on a break, but she didn't tell him about some of the other men until much,  much later, and she had lied to him about them, which hurt him very deeply.  He claimed, when we last spoke to him, that he had had some suicidal thoughts over this 
[01:25:30]  toxic relationship that he can't seem to get himself out of, and it is with a girl,  he says.  He says.  Why don't you bring her in?  We're not going to attack her.  We'll be very nice to her.  I don't fuck with people's chicks.  Get her side of the story.  She's interested in coming in.  Yeah.  And it's an ex-girlfriend, but she ripped her shirt today, so you guys are still living  together, even though you guys don't go out?  We're still living together.  Do you sleep in the same bed?  We still sleep in the same bed.  Wow.  Do you rub your dick against her butt while she's sleeping still? 
[01:26:00]  Do you touch her in bed?  I tried to be abstinent.  Yeah.  But it's not working out.  No?  Are you having sex with her?  Yes.  You're having sexual relations with her?  And she's up for that?  As friends.  As friends.  So you're having sex as friends.  And what happened to that weird almost tattoo you had?  The cremation tattoo.  It's gone.  Yeah.  You're over.  Yeah.  You're washed off.  You're over.  You really went for the commitment with that, didn't you? 
[01:26:30]  Really committed to that.  What did it say on your arm?  It said cremate me.  Yeah.  We'll see.  Sean's wonderful.  You missed all this.  No, I didn't.  I was here.  Yeah.  Didn't you have to leave me a little bit?  I did, but I caught that part.  All right.  I'm sorry.  I remember that part.  Cremate me.  Exactly.  Yeah.  It's another word for come on my face.  Yeah.  Cream.  Sorry, Sean.  So why did she rip your shirt this morning?  Not this morning, a while ago.  Did she grab you by the collar and shake you or something? 
[01:27:00]  What happened there?  No, she's just ripping my clothes off.  Oh.  Oh.  Does she wear them, too?  She's got more of a sex drive than me.  Really?  It's always been a problem.  You would have the same sex drive if she was a man.  Okay.  Well, that implies.  What?  Homosexuality.  Oh.  So she loves the cock.  I'm just going with the fact that he says he would possibly do the rent boy thing.  Too much.  Too much.  Now, how come you're not just in there giving her the cock?  Well, I'm just a one-timer. 
[01:27:30]  You're like, meh.  How old are you?  Take a look.  21.  You're a one-timer at 21?  Wow.  You should be.  Just do it once and that's it.  21, you should be easy six.  I think if it was a musky asshole, it might be a little different.  We're getting there all day long.  21 is an easy six a day.  Dude, I was jerking off so badly by that age.  Like, literally, I was a mess by the time I was 21, too.  You were a one-time guy at 21? 
[01:28:00]  I was an edger, jerk-off edger.  Look, the numbers slow down a little bit.  Sure, but at 21, you should be way above one.  Could you keep fucking when you were 21?  Like, when you were 21?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Downtime was nothing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Really?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Downtime was nothing.  You're just fucking and fucking and fucking, fucking, fucking, fucking, fucking, eating,  drinking, fucking, fucking.  But he's doing all, he's down to one a day at 21?  Wow.  We're trying to tell Sean to hold out on her, because she's playing psychological games 
[01:28:30]  with him.  Yeah.  Now she's telling him.  Physiological games.  Yes.  Yes.  Now she's telling him that this week she told him that when she said that she cheated on  him, when she said, I lied to you, I was cheating on you with three guys, not one.  Now she says, I was lying about that.  The lie was a lie?  That's what she says, but she's just fucking with this little head.  That is really fucking with you.  Wow.  The two other guys that she claims, she's backtracked now, she claims she didn't have 
[01:29:00]  sex with them, didn't do anything with them, she said it to fuck with me.  The Asian guy?  To manipulate.  No, the Asian guy happened.  That did happen.  You can always follow, I'm never afraid of following an Asian guy.  That's true.  Yeah.  That's easy.  Unless I'm driving, I never get out of the way.  Why not, why not, why not?  Wow.  So you're still in turmoil.  And she, uh, she saw pictures of Troy, who works here.  Uh-oh.  She let Sean know that she thought he was very good looking.  He is.  Why don't we get Troy in here? 
[01:29:30]  And Sean wants to tell fucking Troy to leave your goddamn almost-  Step off.  Tell him to step off.  Yeah, where's Troy?  And she's been Facebook messaging Troy.  Oh, that's not good.  And here comes Troy.  Any type of electronic communications with a girl always ends in sex.  Yeah.  It does.  He lives one block away from me.  Troy and his Jimmy Neutron hair.  Hi, Troy.  Troy, so, uh, is that my-  Oh, okay.  So, Sean-  Now, his ex-girlfriend or girlfriend, whatever the fuck she is these days, has been contacting 
[01:30:00]  you.  Yes.  Just hit me up on Facebook.  On Facebook.  Yeah.  Well, I met her the other week.  We went out.  I took him out.  And, uh, this kid's a pussy magnet.  I mean, if you take him out, girls just flock to you, but-  Do they really?  They do.  Uh, and girls love him.  But I met her real quick, and, uh, I guess she texted him immediately following, saying-  What did she say?  Said, well, well, well.  Troy seems really cute.  Oh, fuck.  He looks really cute.  And this is when he was standing right next to Troy. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  And Troy's, like, tatted up, so he's, like, the bad boy kind of a thing, right?  Which you aren't.  He's got an Elvis fucking belt buckle on.  Yeah.  That's true.  Older guy with a job.  He's actually wearing blue suede shoes.  Older guy with a job.  Yeah.  He's rocking.  He's not some goofy student with flat-ironed hair.  Wait.  No offense, Sean.  None taken.  I want to go-  I want to go back a little bit, though.  You say Troy's more of a man.  Hold on.  He appears to be.  I want to go back, though.  If he's a pussy magnet, then why are you only getting off once a day?  What's wrong with you?  That's all I can handle. 
[01:31:00]  That's all you can handle.  Why?  What happens?  Just once and-  Vitamin deficiency?  I go to sleep.  You go to sleep?  You don't eat meat, do you?  Yeah, narcoleptic?  Come on.  He said he's only been eating one meal a day.  Yeah, that should be pussy.  It's out of a cock like a fucking hamster.  He is waif-  You are waif-  You are waif-y, Sean.  Do you eat meat?  Are you vegetarian?  Oh, boy.  Questions loaded.  No, I eat meat.  You can put-  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Eating and just putting it in your mouth are two different.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Okay, he's not-  You gotta- 
[01:31:30]  He's built like Fiona Apple.  Right.  You really are.  How much you weigh?  Because she went on a diet for a month.  What do you weigh?  120.  Really skinny.  120?  So he's a pussy magnet, but he's not knocking back pussy, though.  I just think he's a little confused.  You know what I mean?  I don't think he's-  I think he's gay.  He's-  I think he's right on that borderline.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like, I think people are either born-  There's like a line.  You're either straight, gay, and then sometimes there's some people that fall in the middle.  They're a little confused.  He's sitting on the fence post. 
[01:32:00]  He's a little too close.  He's too close to the line.  Exactly.  Troy told Sean yesterday-  Bad joke.  No joke.  I didn't.  Never mind.  What did he say?  Nothing.  He told him that he had his feet dangling in the pool.  Like, he was outside the water, but his toes are in there.  So, like, maybe if he gave sucking dick a shot, he might like it.  That's all I'm saying.  Sean, would you give it a shot just to see for the show?  Um, not right now.  No, I'm not saying at this moment. 
[01:32:30]  You need about 15 minutes.  So you have 15 minutes?  I think toes in the pool is a bit of an understatement.  I'd say right now he's fucking-  He needs a breathing tool.  Yeah, give him a snorkel.  You know what?  If this kid could figure it out, if he could get his confidence up and figure out who he is,  he'd be raking an insane pussy.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Insane pussy.  Where'd you guys go?  I know these two girls.  It was two twins.  It was their birthday party.  Jesus, Fonzie.  I know. 
[01:33:00]  She had a bunch of friends, and I was like-  I was going to go by myself, but I'm like, Sean, come with me.  You know?  And just talk to these girls.  You don't know them.  Just kick it.  And, of course, he had to break down his whole story to every girl there.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  This one girl rips the phone out of his hands, like, let me give you my number, and I need  to call myself.  Ripped the phone out of his hands just to put her number in that phone.  And how hot were the twins?  Hot.  Yeah, they're hot.  Yeah.  Two hot Asian twins.  No.  Did he bang him?  Do you?  No.  Have you ever?  No.  Cool.  I wish.  Asian twins.  Yeah.  Look at that. 
[01:33:30]  Really?  All right, so-  Sean doesn't know that he's very good looking.  Yes, he does.  He says he doesn't.  He's very insecure about himself.  He knows he's good looking.  Sean, are you good looking?  I don't think so.  Yeah, but he knows.  That's self-image.  Is that what it is?  You got a poor self-image.  What do you see when you look in the mirror?  What do you see?  You see a guy that's what?  He said you're wrong already.  Do we need some sad music before he answers this?  Yeah, what do you see?  Just gangly looking. 
[01:34:00]  Gangly?  Gangly.  Yeah, gangly.  What else?  Looking awkward.  Awkward.  Danny has had it.  Yes, Danny.  You can't be upset for looking gangly if you eat one meal a day and wear the tightest jeans  on earth.  Exactly.  You're doing it on purpose.  You want to look gangly because you understand that that's the style that you're going for.  Is that true, Sean?  Um, well, I like tight-fitting clothes.  Yeah.  So then you want to look gangly if you're only eating one meal a day. 
[01:34:30]  No, I...  You could change this if you wanted to.  Like, you could eat a pizza or a burger and you could wear looser clothes.  Consult E-Rod.  And then you won't look so gangly.  Yes, you want to lose gangly immediately.  We missed a great line from Stephen S. from Bayshore.  Oh.  Aren't all Asians twins?  Who the fuck could tell the difference?  Oh, shit.  They're just classmates.  Uh...  Uh, yeah.  Nice.  Uh, continue, Sean.  When you look in the mirror.  Yeah.  Awkward looking guy. 
[01:35:00]  Awkward looking.  What do you think your faults are?  Can't function in social settings.  Yeah.  Um, doesn't like to go to parties.  Just likes to sit in my room all the time.  How old are your parents?  Like, 40.  Like, what do they do for a living?  Well, my father's in Iraq right now.  Oh, yeah?  He's an insurgent.  Wait, what is he doing in Iraq?  Yeah.  What's he doing?  He's in the Air Force.  Oh, he's in the Air Force?  Aw, shit.  How many times did he beat the shit out of you growing up? 
[01:35:30]  Oh, my God.  Start to talk American Beauty.  Fucking Great Santini.  Great Santini.  I'm thinking.  How many times did he...  You're gonna squirt?  Yeah.  How many times did he buy you planes and you shoved them up your ass and he's like,  No, it's wrong.  It's not how you play with this thing.  Does your dad...  What did he do for the Air Force?  Does he wish you were more manly?  I bet.  Um, yeah, he wishes, like, I'd cut my hair and, like...  God damn it.  Stop wearing the clothes that I wear.  Yeah.  Kind of man up.  What does he do for the Air Force? 
[01:36:00]  Like, what's his kind of job in the Air Force?  Some people are just communication.  Some people work in the kitchen.  Some people are pilots.  What does he do?  Can I say that?  Like, what he...  He tells me what he does over in Baghdad.  Yeah, what does he do?  Yeah, we don't know his name.  Um, well, they collect bombs.  And then they bring him out into the desert, bury him, and blow him up.  So he's...  I guess that's one of the things.  He's like a Herlocker guy?  What's he called in?  A sapper?  Sapper?  Is he a guy that's fucking, uh, engineer for, uh, explosives? 
[01:36:30]  Technician.  Something like that.  It works a lot on the base.  On the base.  Yeah.  What's your mom doing?  Going down to the base.  I should be taking it to the base, yeah.  Yeah, well...  That's alright.  You actually made it look like he was just going to visit his dad.  Yeah, I know.  You're actually driving to the base.  What?  To the base.  Alright.  So, what does your mom do?  Occupational therapy.  I'm not sure what that is. 
[01:37:00]  I'm not sure what it is either.  Is she a therapist?  Yeah.  Oh.  Helps people walk again.  Oh, okay, okay.  Ah, there you go.  That's nice.  That's very charitable.  Very charitable.  Did you guys see Sean's boots?  Yeah.  No.  Lift them up.  She probably got them from one of the victims who are never going to walk again.  Holy shit.  He just...  You got like some type of boots on there.  They're like mod kind of beetle boots almost.  They're ruining his posture.  Are they?  Yeah.  Why?  Because he says because they're raised and pointed, he kind of walks with his shoulders  pointed in. 
[01:37:30]  And he looks like a fool.  He looks like a fool?  Is that what you think?  He looks like fucking...  He's wearing superhero shoes.  They look like fucking like Robin shoes.  Superhero.  So, all right, pussy bag knit.  All right, let's get it into the thing now.  So, uh, Sean, your sort of girlfriend likes Troy.  How did that all go down?  I guess she saw the We Are the World video.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, the behind the scenes.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  That was the first time that she saw Troy because Troy's in that video. 
[01:38:00]  Certainly is.  She's like, wow, you have to introduce me to this guy.  I didn't know you had such great looking guys on the staff of Opinion.  And this is while they were dating, before they broke up.  Yeah, why would she do that to you?  She likes to antagonize.  She knows she can play you.  She likes to antagonize.  But she's manipulating him.  Yeah, but if you can have a lot of pussy out there, what are you doing dealing with  this shit?  Exactly.  Exactly.  Us pathetic guys deal with that shit.  Yeah.  I'm in love.  I'm in love.  Oh, God.  You're 21.  But you know what?  All he has to do is just dip in some strange, and he'll forget all about that girlfriend right 
[01:38:30]  there.  Yeah.  That's what we're trying to do.  We're trying to coach him in that direction.  Well, I think you need to fuck his girl.  See, that's what I said.  It's funny that you say that.  Yeah, man.  So then he could finally get over it.  Yeah.  She's pretty?  She's cute.  Yeah.  I mean, I think he could do a lot better, honestly.  Oh, look at that.  What is she, like a six, seven?  You got a picture of the broad on you?  Well, she's Brazilian, so she looks exotic.  Exotic?  Yeah.  I could bring up a picture.  Yeah, punch up a picture of her on the computer here. 
[01:39:00]  Go ahead.  Type away.  Don't say her name.  Dude, suck dicks.  Don't instinctively go to meat spin.  Who's the spin?  We're going to meet him.  We're going to finally take a look at Sean's girl.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We got to take a look.  Is that her right there?  What?  How many?  I think he's got a log in.  Oh, log.  He's got a log in, all right.  This kid is confusing.  I'm just speculating.  You're very confusing. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, she is, right?  Like, have you ever sucked a dick?  No.  Have you ever had one just resting on your face casually and you pretend that it wasn't there?  No.  He started flat ironing his hair when he was young because he saw his mother and sister  doing it and thought that he should, too.  Oh, that's good.  How do you flat iron hair?  Um, you take a straightening iron and you...  Let me see this.  Let's see this.  He's telling you like you should know.  Fine.  Just grab a pic and, uh...  Which one do you want to...  Which one shows her? 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Which one shows, like, full body, face?  What's she doing with the little bikini bottom?  Let me turn this this way so I can see.  The one on the right?  She's pretty.  God damn.  She's a sexy girl.  Oh, not so much there, though.  Well, no, she cleans up nice.  Which one?  The one on the right?  Yeah, she's a cute girl.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You can see that.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, in the shower?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Nice rack.  What's going on there?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Big pillow lips.  What's going on there?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, these are like some...  Wow.  She's into cuckolding, probably, and humiliation. 
[01:40:30]  Now, look at the two of you there.  Where is that taken?  Right by the Brooklyn Bridge?  Dude, for a second, I thought that was two girls.  Yeah.  You were right.  No, not even.  Then I focused and said, oh, shit, that's Sean.  Now, look at these pictures.  They look like fucking a shot for a perfume ad.  Young Judd Nelson.  Yeah, what are you doing?  Ooh.  Go back one more.  Ooh, who are those?  Is that the family?  It's like savage pictures and some natums. 
[01:41:00]  Where is she from in Brazil?  She's Dominican.  Dominican.  Oh, Dominican.  Her father's Dominican.  Can she pitch?  That's her mom went into...  I hope so.  Yeah, because we got a catcher.  Her mom went into the Peace Corps.  That's where she met the father in Dominican Republic, because that's where she was stationed.  Ah, you two look like you're in love.  Just figure it out.  Jesus Christ.  Now, what's going on?  Throw a ring on her finger and get over...  He already did, remember?  Who are these other people she's with?  She puts pictures of her with other guys to antagonize me. 
[01:41:30]  Is that what it's for?  And how old a gal is she?  Make me jealous.  What's that?  How old is she?  20.  She's your age.  I love her.  She's a fucking...  She'll probably...  It's like, you think she'd fuck you and tell you about guys she fucked while you're fucking her?  What's that?  That sounds like something she would do.  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah, you ought to try that.  It's fun.  We can't...  You're missing out, kid.  We can't beat her up.  She's all right.  She's pretty.  A little dose of humiliation goes a long way.  Wow.  She really...  That picture, not so much.  She really has you. 
[01:42:00]  The main picture sucks on Facebook.  Wrapped around her finger, doesn't she?  Yep, yeah.  Are you going to kill yourself over her?  No, he's not.  I never know.  We're just trying to tell him you'd just jerk off more often.  He wouldn't be so hung up over her.  Are you trying to be a model?  Yeah, what are you doing?  He doesn't want to put on the top with...  Ew!  What is that?  It's not a hint of a muscle on your chest.  Dude, I'll tell you what that is.  That's fucking a red boy picture.  Hey, Gio.  Look at this guy.  What are you looking up at?  Are you trying to be a model?  That's her photography project. 
[01:42:30]  Oh.  Yeah?  She's a photographer?  Yeah.  You know what?  I was a subject for my girl's photography class, but I didn't get fucking naked.  Wait, where are your photos?  That's what she told me to do.  There's a couple.  I'll bring them in.  I don't give a shit.  Nothing like that.  Oh, what is that?  What is...  Take your shirt off.  I lose the pants, honey.  Yeah.  It's like Irene fucking kerosene in fame.  Yeah.  What is...  He wants to be a model.  Yeah.  Do you want to be a model?  Is that what you're gunning for?  God damn.  Look at that shot of her, though.  No.  I like the other one with the...  Troy, would you do that? 
[01:43:00]  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  You'd do that, right?  You'd be all up in that shit, right?  Absolutely.  Are you going to?  I said if...  Shoot a tray up in that piece.  If he introduces me to her, I'm going to fuck her.  That's what I said.  In no uncertain terms.  And Sam, Troy doesn't play, right?  No.  I mean, Troy is...  That's the real deal?  ...single and available to do that.  That's right.  You would have no...  Now, I just got out of a relationship.  Oh, I'm sorry, man.  All right.  No, it's all right.  It's a good thing.  What would stop you from, you know, having sex with Sean's sort of girlfriend?  Well, I like Sean. 
[01:43:30]  He's a nice guy, but, you know, his girlfriend's hot.  What can I say?  Troy would fuck Sean's girlfriend just to help Sean.  Yeah.  Just to teach him a lesson.  It is a helping thing.  Sean, where are you at with this?  Would you mind if Troy...  Banged your girl?  Yeah.  Oh, that would be pretty traumatic.  I would never introduce my chick to this guy.  Why don't we put the sad music...  Sad music again, please.  And let's...  Why don't you talk to Troy about how that would not be a good thing for you?  Danny Gast.  Here's your music.  Go ahead. 
[01:44:00]  Danny Gast one.  Just the thought of that, you know.  I don't know why you'd want to, like, break up our friendship over some crazy psycho likes to...  You know that if you were to do her, that would just be plain...  Why are you sticking your penis forward as you talk to Troy?  Exactly.  It's like a magnet.  Playing into her.  It's like a magnet.  Manipulative...  He's trying to be cool, but his penis is saying something different. 
[01:44:30]  Sorry.  Ooh, man.  Her manipulative nature.  She would be trying to...  Danny's cancer.  I just dropped one.  She'd be trying to do you to get back at me.  Right.  But you know that this would just be for your own good.  You know that.  I'd be here to teach you a lesson.  I'd see that maybe in the long run.  Why don't you, like, ask him not to?  Like...  Yeah.  Beg him.  Say, please, Troy, don't fuck my...  If the opportunity presents itself, I hope you show restraint in fucking my girlfriend. 
[01:45:00]  He'll just restrain her.  I'll do what I can.  Just think about, like, our friendship.  And you think, this is wrong.  Troy.  Have some moral compass.  I'm sure this will work.  Well, let's see.  Troy?  I'll do what I can, but I can't promise anything.  He lives a block away from me, too.  Oh, shit.  Oh, really? 
[01:45:30]  Where do you live?  Up east side.  Okay.  Troy, you want to go home early today?  Yeah.  Sure.  Take the rest of the day off.  All right, cool.  Thanks.  Wow.  What is your girl doing right now, Sean?  She's working.  Yeah.  What does she do for a living?  Am I allowed to say?  The kind of job.  Not where I am or anything, but just what she does.  Like, party rentals.  Party rentals?  In the Hamptons.  Oh, she's getting...  Wow.  Is she getting fucking doctor cock and fucking lawyer cock? 
[01:46:00]  Multi-million dollar cock.  Oh, my God.  Do you know what she's getting out there?  She plans parties in the Hamptons?  Holy shit.  How many times does she call saying that she's going to be a little late?  Celebrity cock.  Yeah.  What time is she supposed to get home?  She got asked out by that Citizen Cope guy.  Oh, we had him on.  I like him.  Well, he's good.  Who is he?  His name is something Greenwood, I think.  His song was in the fucking Ricky Gervais movie.  The name of Sadway, he came and played K-Rock. 
[01:46:30]  Right.  Clarence Greenwood, I think.  Who else asked her out?  I'm sure a lot of guys have asked her.  A guy from Sex and the City asked for her phone number.  Yeah.  Did she say yes?  No, because she was with me at the time.  Oh, really?  She was probably lying.  She's lied so many times.  Yeah.  She's probably fucking the guy from Citizen Cope.  Probably.  Sarah Jessica Parker?  The guy.  Yeah.  Who?  Yeah.  The doll friend, Samantha.  Oh, shit. 
[01:47:00]  All right.  Where are we at with this?  Well, I guess Troy is still up in the air whether he's going to fuck his girlfriend or not here.  Can we get her on the phone?  I mean, Troy might do it now just for the sake of the show.  Yeah.  Just to, you know.  Yeah, you'd have to.  Just to prove a point.  Who's that?  That's prom.  And who's that guy?  Who's she with?  That must be her high school sweetheart.  Who's the guy she's with?  Her ex-boyfriend?  No, just some guy.  Just some guy that fucked her.  Did he fuck her that night?  I think she sucked his dick in the limo. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  Her breath smelled like wine coolers.  Sometimes I think my girl just fucks too many guys.  I'm going to leave.  I don't think anyone will miss me.  Are we trying to get her on the line right now?  Yeah.  Maybe one of the guys she cheats on me with will fuck me.  Kind of like a bonus.  You faggot was here.  It's written on his back. 
[01:48:00]  By the way, who is that lump in that photo with her?  I don't know.  Who's that guy?  This is before college.  Jesus.  Some guy fucking with a...  What's that thing around his neck?  A lay.  A lay.  They're both wearing lays.  She's smiling.  When did she become sexually active?  What age?  Three.  Three.  When did she lose her virginity?  Um, college years.  Yeah, you sure?  Wasn't earlier?  No, that's what she told me.  College years. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, that's what she told me.  She looks like a goer, man.  She has great blowjob lips.  Have you noticed that?  Does she give a good head?  Absolutely.  Does she let you dump in her mouth?  Yes.  Does she swallow it?  Yes.  Do you ask her to kiss you right after?  No.  No.  How tall is she, too?  She looks like she's taller than all our friends.  Just my height.  How tall are you?  It's a radio.  I'm not that tall.  Um, 5'11"? 
[01:49:00]  Without the heels.  Your girl's 5'11"?  She doesn't look 5'11".  Are we getting her on the line?  They're trying.  They're calling.  They have her number.  Yay.  Yay.  Ah, I don't think they got her.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  Holy fuckaroni.  No, it went to first.  No, we'll keep trying.  Holy fuck dolls.  Yeah, yeah.  Hold on.  Holy fuck dolls.  Now we're looking at some bikini pictures.  Yeah.  Wow.  I think I'm understanding Sean a little more. 
[01:49:30]  If you're betting down with that.  I can see why you might want to kill yourself.  Like you're freaking out a little bit at the thought of her just fucking arching that back  and really getting a good dose of dick.  Does she shave her vag?  Yes, she does.  How much?  So there's nothing there.  Nothing there.  She seems very sexual.  Does she have any ass spiders?  Oh, boy.  What's that?  Little hairs around the asshole.  Let's blow that one up, Terry.  Because she can't get back there.  Who is she in that fucking picture with the legs up? 
[01:50:00]  I have some roommate of hers.  That's her on the left?  Yeah, that's her.  On the right with the fucking big arms?  She looks big.  I thought that was a tranny.  She looks big there.  She looks a little big there.  She's kind of tall.  Freshman 15, maybe.  What are you sporting?  Are you satisfying her as far as in the cock department?  How big is your cock he wants to know?  She tells me I'm too big for her, actually.  Oh, really?  Troy, what about you?  I'm all right.  I mean, I don't know.  I guess we'll find out. 
[01:50:30]  We'll just let her compare.  Oh, wow.  That was a shot.  We understand all the tattoos and the Elvis belt buckle and the hairdo.  I mean, Troy has been without a mate for several weeks now.  He's aching to just get out there.  I think this whole idea of saving a friendship thing with some 21-year-old that he's known for a month is...  That's bullshit.  I don't know how well that's going to...  Yeah, that's bullshit.  That's what I'm worried about.  ...about a five-year relationship, so I'm ready to dip in some strange. 
[01:51:00]  You know what I mean?  Like ASAP.  Like, yeah, pronto.  Yeah.  Are you depressed?  No.  No, I'm good, man.  No, it's cool.  But it's funny because we're sort of in the same spot because I'm still living with my girlfriend.  Why?  How is this?  What is this?  How?  Well, you know, when you live in New York City and you're in a lease, I mean, what the fuck are you supposed to do?  It's called you can't afford to fucking get...  It's called you can't afford to fucking get...  Yeah.  No, but I mean, are you...  What do you...  Do you ask her, where were you when she goes out?  No.  No.  How do you not?  No one cares.  You just...  You sleep in the same bed? 
[01:51:30]  Occasionally, yeah.  And that's why I'm trying to help him out because...  Any sex going on?  No.  Are you mad at each other?  No.  No, we have dinner together occasionally.  Does she walk out of the shower nude?  Not really.  I mean, if she does, I won't say anything, but...  Nice shit.  It's funny because he broke up with his girlfriend and they're living together and I'm doing the same thing.  That's a fucking fat rump.  She drops good little stinkers.  Smell like fucking rice.  You have any nude pictures of her anywhere, like in private? 
[01:52:00]  Of me?  Yeah.  Yeah, you're wearing...  That's you?  Yeah.  He's a fucking lesbian.  It looks like her ugly girlfriend.  Yeah.  I'm telling you, he wants to be a model.  Hey, ugly Betty.  These are all model pictures.  Yeah, lately.  Did you send these fucking pictures into an agency?  No.  Now, back to the nude pictures.  Do you have any naked pictures of her?  Private ones?  On my laptop.  Well, how about you bring it in?  Can you access it from here?  She'd kill me, but...  Go to mypc.com. 
[01:52:30]  I'll pay.  She'd kill me, but yeah.  Yeah.  I'll show you something.  Yeah.  After seeing 800 pictures of them together, I believe that he's probably straighter than  we thought to begin with.  And I believe that this girl will completely destroy him.  Destroy him, right.  That's what we're fighting.  This girl is going to ruin you.  She is way more experienced than you are.  Is she a big vagina?  Small?  Big.  Really?  Big lips?  Big, yeah.  Big hole?  A lot of stuff hanging out of it.  Does she have a big hole? 
[01:53:00]  Is there a lot of stuff hanging out of it?  No.  Why do you say it's big, then?  It just looks big.  I mean, in my experience with other girls, it's the biggest I've seen.  Really?  Can you see it bulging in panties?  No.  A boo.  So how many other girls have you been with?  Four.  Four.  Including her?  Yeah, including.  So the three other girls.  And three other girls.  And how did those end? 
[01:53:30]  Not well.  I always get cheated.  I always get cheated on.  Do you eat pussy?  Guys like Troy.  Each one.  Oh, that's a good question.  Yeah.  Guys like Troy.  Guys like Troy come over and fucking take your girls away.  No, he's actually saying guys like Troy.  Oh.  Me himself.  So do you eat pussy well?  Good question.  You'd have to ask her.  Well, we're trying to get her on the line.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  You're not going to say if you eat pussy or not?  No, I do.  I don't like it.  Why don't you like it?  You don't like lick what? 
[01:54:00]  Why?  What are you a communist?  What's wrong with pussy?  When it smells.  You ask her to shower before you eat her pussy?  Hold on a minute.  No.  She's tired of you.  Wait a minute, though.  I had a smelly vagina about the same year as you did.  You did?  Oh, God.  When did you?  Well, you were young.  You didn't know how to clean it yet.  I always thought you were a man.  Yeah.  He might have one of those girls.  One of my girlfriends from Geneseo had a really bad smelly fucking vagina.  I don't think a 20-year-old's vagina can smell. 
[01:54:30]  Anthony.  What?  If this girl was 19 or 20, there was something horribly wrong with her vagina.  Well, then that's something got to be really bad.  So maybe that's the case.  Have you smelled enough vaginas to know that she has some kind of issue down there?  Because vagina just smells like vagina.  Yeah.  And then there's bad, and then there's like sometimes none.  Does your girl's pussy smell like flu breath?  What does it smell like?  You don't want to go down there.  If we're in the shower, it's fine.  Yuck. 
[01:55:00]  In the shower?  What, do you want a soapy vag?  Wait, I'm telling you, she might have an issue.  That bacteria thing.  So when she's not in the shower.  Wait, we got to run the phone.  Oh, oh, oh.  What's her name?  Kat.  Sean, you talk to her.  Hello?  Hello.  Hi.  Hi, what's up?  Hi.  You're on the air here with the Opie and Anthony show.  We're trying to get to know your sort of boyfriend, Sean.  He's been with us for a while now.  We're just trying to figure this kid out.  He's very mysterious.  Can you help us out by just overall talking about Sean? 
[01:55:30]  What kind of guy he is?  Yeah, give us your impressions of him.  Well, he's a very nice guy.  Very sweet.  Yeah, see that.  And a lot of people are surprised that he's not gay.  Yeah, yeah.  See, that's the kicker right there.  A lot of people are surprised he's not gay.  Well, let's go with that.  Do you think he might be sort of gay?  Um, well, I don't know.  Because since he's so sweet, I really like being with him. 
[01:56:00]  But I guess the thing that he makes me wear boxers to bed and makes me pull my hair back  and talk in a deep voice when we're in bed kind of makes me...  What?  What?  What?  I'm kidding.  That's not...  That's not entirely...  She's yanking your chain.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I wish.  So she might be arranged.  Funny, he makes her dress like Jake LaMotta before she goes to bed. 
[01:56:30]  Wife beat her on.  Put her on a t-shirt.  Yeah.  Well, we're looking at your pictures.  You're, well, let's say it.  You're gorgeous.  Yeah, you're a very pretty girl.  Exotic.  You got those nice pillow lips.  We hear you got a nice big vag.  Jesus, that's what he...  Yeah, Sean said you have a big vagina.  Is that inappropriate?  Um, a little, I guess.  And he said that...  I don't think he means like a big hole or anything.  No, no.  He just means like in general. 
[01:57:00]  He's saying it in a good way.  It's impressive.  He said his penis is too large for you.  Is that true?  Yeah, is that true?  No.  Oh, what?  Say, wow.  Say, wow.  I see.  Now, what, how does he measure up to other gentlemen that you've been with?  Um, he falls a little short.  No, he's good.  He's really good.  Yeah?  He is good.  Okay, that's good.  Now, let's get into some of this, uh, these shenanigans that have been going on of late. 
[01:57:30]  Um, you, now, yeah.  Uh, early in the morning for the...  Yeah, I know, but, you know, that's what time we're on.  We would love to call in the afternoon, but no one would hear it.  Although, if you give me your number, I'll call you and we can discuss it, uh, you know, uh, one-on-one.  Would you actually do it behind his back end?  Oh, hell yeah.  Oh, my God.  What are you kidding?  Anytime.  Um, yeah, you, uh, you, now, you, you said to him that you have been with a couple of other guys. 
[01:58:00]  Mm-hmm.  Um, and then you said that, no, you were only with the one guy, and, and now you're saying  that was a lie.  You have been with three gentlemen, uh, behind his back, kind of.  No, no, no.  Okay, so he knows about one.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, and then the other two, I fabricated.  Uh-huh.  In a way, well, the first one was just to see if he got jealous, because we were hitting 
[01:58:30]  a rough patch where he was just, like, I just felt like he was uninterested.  Yeah.  And that he just didn't care, and it, which got sort of into a routine, and it was just,  like, boring him.  Yeah.  So I thought maybe if I said something like that, then he would venture out and maybe find  someone else and be happy.  Not that I wanted to break up with him, but I just felt like he wasn't happy in our relationship.  Okay.  Well, he, he says that you're, uh...  No, it's that shit insane. 
[01:59:00]  It's that shit insane.  I know that.  And now it seems like a stupid fucking idea, but at the time, I thought that was going  to work out, because my sister pulled some crap like this with her boyfriend, so I was  just like, oh, this could work, and it just didn't work out in my face.  Okay.  Well, he says he doesn't like licking your pussy because it smells.  What?  Yeah, he said he doesn't like going down on you.  Now, what?  It's not my preference.  Isn't that something that you probably would enjoy, right?  He would enjoy that.  Um, yeah. 
[01:59:30]  Like, a lot of girls like a guy to be a little attentive down there with their tongue, right?  Yeah, I guess so.  Feels good.  It gives a girl the opportunity to just lay back and enjoy herself and feel good, and  he doesn't enjoy doing this.  She doesn't allow me to do it.  Why?  Well, Sean's a little selfish when it comes to that, actually.  Oh, what do you mean he's selfish?  What does he not do right?  No, no, no.  I'm just saying he more lays back, and he's like, oh, my time.  And I'm like, oh, my time.  Oh, so you're not even giving her... 
[02:00:00]  You know what?  A guy like Troy will fucking give her such a great night of pleasure that she'll forget  about you.  You're not attentive to her sexually.  I'm working on that.  I'm working on it.  You can't work on it.  You're working on it, and he's a professional already.  I'll give her a run for her money.  Yeah.  This Troy will lick her pussy and make sure his thumb is in her asshole.  Oh, forget about it.  He won't need hair gel the next day.  His hair will look like that from just pussy juice.  That's right.  That was my point.  Yeah. 
[02:00:30]  Over-explaining ass.  Hold on, Matt.  I apologize for all the crass language you have to hear.  Yes, that's Jimmy Norton talking.  So he's not attentive enough to your oral sex needs?  Mm-hmm.  I'm asking.  Well, do you think you have a smelly pussy?  Because that's what Sean was sort of hinting at.  No, I don't.  If anything, I put up with a lot of crap because, well, one, sometimes he even turns down head,  which blows my mind.  He turns down a blowjob.  You turn down a blowjob? 
[02:01:00]  If I'm not feeling it.  Giving or receiving?  Oh, Jesus.  If you're not feeling it, a guy feels a blowjob.  It doesn't matter what you're doing.  Really?  A blowjob is like, how do you not feel a...  I'm just not feeling having a girl suck my cock.  I'm sorry.  I'm not feeling this right now.  I'm really not feeling it.  Are you kidding?  What else do you have to do that's more important or better?  If I'm just...  Well, if I'm just not feeling it.  How do you not feel it? 
[02:01:30]  If I'm not feeling it, I just don't want to be touched.  There are times when you don't want to be touched.  You should have said that at eight years old.  Oh, sweet.  Smallest station.  Let me ask Troy.  Smallest station.  Let me ask Troy.  Yes.  Have you ever been in a situation where you weren't feeling getting a blowjob?  I mean, if I'm really sick or something.  But you could wake me up in the middle of the night and say, I'm going to blow you.  I'd be like, all right, let's go.  Oh, he's nodding his head. 
[02:02:00]  Yes.  No, he wasn't talking to you, Sean.  But even when you're sick, that feeling of having a flu bag, a fever bag is great.  Just like a Turkish taffy.  Absolutely.  It's like a full mouthful of chewed hubba bubba.  Hey, what's her name again?  Kat.  Just madame.  Kat.  All right, Kat.  Have you ever stuck anything in his hiney?  No, I haven't.  Like a large bowling trophy.  Has he asked for that?  Does he like butt play? 
[02:02:30]  No?  Now, what do you think it is with, why do you think, do you like the idea of humiliating  him sexually?  Like, does that turn you on?  Like to taunt him a little bit with other men?  No, but wait, what do you mean?  In bed?  Yeah, or like the idea of him being jealous or thinking you're going to go out and have  sex with his friend, Troy.  That was a joke.  Troy's a handsome guy, though.  Very handsome.  He is handsome, but it was a joke.  Yeah.  So you were just kind of being playful with your boyfriend and just kind of teasing 
[02:03:00]  him, and he might have taken it very literally?  A joke, all right.  Yeah, well, he was, no, because we were going back and forth because he was talking about  some girl or something from school, so I was just like, oh, yeah.  It's a joke right up until it's not a fucking joke, by the way, with girls.  Let me explain something to you, and a lot of comics have gone over this subject.  Airplane food.  I'm sorry.  You know, what's with the peanuts?  Every guy knows the guy your girlfriend will fuck if she breaks up with you, and Troy is 
[02:03:30]  it right there.  Wow.  You just, you know the guy she will fuck.  Yep.  And no matter how much you say, like, I think that guy's, like, giving you the eye, or I  think, you know, he's getting a little close, so they will absolutely deny it, but when  you break up, they will be fucking that guy.  You know it.  It's instinctive.  Right.  So she could say she's joking, but there is an attraction there. 
[02:04:00]  You find a physical attraction with Troy, right?  I just think he's good-looking.  I don't know him at all.  Yeah, he's good-looking.  Okay, so just physical.  But that's all you need to start the ball rolling.  Believe me.  Everyone is like, what the fuck about turning down a blowjob?  You could be on your deathbed, and you're not going to turn down a blowjob.  I actually have to agree with Sean.  There's times where you don't want to be touched, and not, no, no, honestly.  He's 21!  It doesn't matter.  There's times where you're like, eh.  If the wind blows, he should be getting hard at this point. 
[02:04:30]  But Jimmy's sexuality is really odd.  He'll jerk off for 12 fucking hours straight, and-  But I'm only saying that there are times where, as a guy, you're like, eh.  I think Sean is really, really honest about what he likes and doesn't like.  Like, he doesn't have this image of masculinity where he thinks he's supposed to like  something, so he says he likes it.  Like, we're all trained a certain way.  I think that he's brutally honest.  Do you like eating your pussy?  Eh, sometimes, but other times, eh.  Does he lick your asshole?  What?  Does he, when he's going down on you, let me ask her, nice, this is his girl. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  When he's going down on you, um-  I apologize, sorry.  Does he venture to the back at all, or does he kind of just keep it up in the front?  Oh, well, if I can get him in the front, he usually stays to the front.  Stays to the front?  Wait, you like going to the back.  You don't like, uh, going to the back?  No.  Why is that?  Oh, wow, he's making a face like, ugh.  Why?  What's wrong with you?  He just bit into a lemon.  Because I've been, I've been living with her for two years.  What does that matter?  So he's walked into the bathroom after he's gone. 
[02:05:30]  You know, he comes out of there.  Brazilian food?  Dominican.  Yeah?  Oh, well.  Oh, Dominican.  I'm sorry, I forgot.  Does it turn you, does it bother you that he's like, like, I think a woman's body scent is  very sexy.  There's good chemistry between two people.  Oh, of course.  Her natural smell is very, very sexy.  Yeah.  Do you think that he's a little squeamish about that?  Um, no.  Usually he doesn't really say anything.  Usually the only problem is his ball sweat smell.  That's just the only problem.  Oh, damn.  What does it smell like?  Ball sweat smell? 
[02:06:00]  What does it smell like?  Sean.  It happens very infrequently.  What does it smell like when it does smell?  It's just really bad.  He's just like, what?  What?  And I'm like, nothing.  Oh, wait.  He'll ask you to go down on him after his bag has been fucking fruit rolled up to his leg.  What's that?  No, I'm just saying, that's the thing.  Like, he doesn't ask.  He doesn't ever ask for it.  Oh, so you just go down and then you realize, uh-oh, there's a ball sweat problem.  Yeah, but I'm like, you know what? 
[02:06:30]  It doesn't matter.  I love you.  I'm going to do this anyway.  Wow.  See?  She's a trooper.  She's a trooper and you're not willing to fucking go down there because of what?  There's a little bit of what?  Does it smell like fish?  I just...  Yeah, it's true.  I'm selfish.  Oh.  He said, does it smell like fish?  Not are you selfish?  Yeah, like, what does it smell like when it's bad down there?  Yeah, what do you consider like a bad smelling...  Yeah.  If I can't do it.  If I can't...  If you can't get your head down there...  So if you're not repelled physically. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  There's actual, like, green mist coming off it, like Pepe Le Pew's tail.  Like I said, the shower's great.  It's great for that.  Yeah?  The shower...  So you need a constant water fucking barrage going over it?  That doesn't sound good, Kat.  Yeah.  Is he saying that he does that in the shower?  Because he's never done that in the shower.  Oh!  Shit.  Why are your pants on fire?  Oh, wow.  And getting back to the blowjob thing, because the guys out there are out of their minds.  Ludwig Vaughn from North Hanson, PA. 
[02:07:30]  Ludwig Vaughn.  He goes, I wouldn't turn down a BJ if I was in the middle of getting a BJ.  That's true.  Yeah, you can't really turn those down.  Does he talk dirty to you, at least?  Sometimes.  See, I asked...  I wish you had a cock.  Wait, what, Kat?  What?  Because it was getting a little, I don't know, like, you know, romantic sex is good, but sometimes you're into a little more hardcore, I guess? 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, dirty.  Oh, yeah, okay.  Choking.  Like, I bought handcuffs, and we only used them once.  Yeah, he slips right out of them, I'm sure.  Those fucking little...  Little Sid Vicious arms.  Yeah, little wrists.  So, um...  I was the one in them.  Oh, you were the one in them.  Oh, very nice.  And you wanted him to kind of cuff you and maybe spank you.  He talked dirty, he just read her Miranda rights.  And he's just too timid, I think, right? 
[02:08:30]  Huh?  No, he told me that you guys taught him how to spank an ass.  Yeah, but he spanked a guy's ass, it was a goof.  And it was really bad, he was very bad at it, as I recall.  Would you like to come in and be spanked by members of the staff?  For the bit, of course.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think you should come in.  And be spanked by members of the staff.  Is that your biggest nightmare, Sean?  Her coming in here, in this den of wolves?  And walking away with someone?  Yeah, perhaps, maybe walking away with somebody.  Just being devoured. 
[02:09:00]  Or just the attention she would get.  And with no consideration towards your feelings, by the way.  By so many of the gentlemen around here.  I'm a deeply jealous person, so.  You are, yeah?  So you guys going to get back together, Kat?  Yeah, what do you think?  What?  Are you guys getting back together?  I don't know, because now I feel like a Natalie Rebound.  And I don't know if you guys have seen that girl, but.  A Natalie Rebound?  A Natalie Rebound.  That's the chick who we went to her house last weekend and slept over. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, can we see a picture of her?  And cupped her breast.  Where's Natalie?  He cupped her breast.  Yeah, that's all he got off her.  You cupped her breast?  Can we see a picture of her?  She's cute, though.  Okay, if you look at her Facebook, there are no pictures under her collarbone.  And that is the reason why.  She might be a...  Oh, shit.  Why, because what?  No, she only has face pictures.  She's a fatty.  There's no pictures of her under the collarbone.  Is her name Fattily?  Sam, what do we know about Natalie? 
[02:10:00]  Well, Natalie, she wasn't...  Let me take a look at Natalie.  Get a little reconnaissance here.  Let's take a look.  Yeah, let's take a look at Natalie.  This is the girl Sean sort of went home with.  Thumbnail's not looking bad.  Let me see.  No, I'll give her...  That's Natalie?  Her face is pretty.  That's Natalie?  Her face is pretty.  Natalie's fucking sexy.  She is slightly thicker than the pictures let on.  Like, she looks a little bigger in person, but she's not fat, like...  Cat is way hotter.  Well, I've never seen Cat in person. 
[02:10:30]  She should come here.  Let's take a little look at some of these.  How do we know Natalie?  Hey, Cat, I have a question for you.  Would it bother you if a guy licked his own semen off your breasts?  No, usually Sean does a taste test for me, so...  All right.  Sean, is that true?  Could you elaborate on that a little bit?  Just, like, dip your tongue in it.  No, you don't.  So, you've ejaculated on her, and then you've put your tongue in, and you're ejaculate. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  Why?  What's wrong with that?  I don't...  It's awful.  Nah, it is...  I agree with both of you.  It is awful, but I also respect the fact he's a trooper.  Not afraid to get his uniform dirty.  But he won't go down on her.  Right, right.  But he'll lick up his own semen.  You'll taste your own semen.  No, no, no.  He won't lick it out.  He just, like, pokes his finger and tastes it.  Yeah, that's just to... 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, just to cleanse the palate.  Yeah, exactly.  It's not fucking...  It's not ginger in a sushi...  Oh, wow.  It's not ginger in a seesaw factory?  What the fuck is...  I know.  I bailed out.  It was a bomb coming, so I stopped.  Oh, that's me, actually.  Licking my own cum out of my hand.  Yeah, that's a lovely picture.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  I did it on fucking for a girl.  Let's say hi to Rich in Ohio.  Rich?  Yeah, regarding the blowjob thing, just quote the great George Carlin, a phrase you'll never hear. 
[02:12:00]  Please stop sucking my cock, or I'll have to call the police.  That was a George Carlin line.  Yes.  Very good, sir.  Thank you, Rich.  So he's dipped his finger in his cum and then tasted it.  But, yeah, he won't then go down on you sometimes because he feels you're not fresh that day.  Um, you gotta do the whole undercarriage, dude.  What are you doing?  Yeah, what do you wash your balls with?  Fucking onions?  You gotta go bellybutting a tailbone on a girl. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I definitely need to stop being selfish.  Step it up.  What's the worst that's gonna happen?  Sometimes, you know, you gotta be a trooper, a soldier.  Get in there.  You should listen to your dad.  Listen to your dad.  He's in Iraq.  Get in there.  Get in the trenches.  If he's never done it before, I'm sure Troy will show you.  Yeah, yeah, Troy will probably know how to fucking take care of that business.  Would you be willing to do this, and only for the bit?  Would you be willing to come in and let every member of the staff lick your vagina for 30 seconds? 
[02:13:00]  And then you could say which technique you enjoyed most, and then Sean could employ that technique.  This is for him.  It's not about us.  Yeah.  Can we be blindfolded?  Yes, you can be blindfolded.  Yeah, and then just go, you know, number one, number two, number three, and you could be like, I like the number eight.  That's right.  And then, you know, that would be the technique that number eight would teach to Sean.  Or I'm thinking we could all get naked, and she squeezes all our cocks and tries to pick out Sean out of a lineup.  What? 
[02:13:30]  That too.  Oh, sorry.  We could get a big board with a bunch of holes in it and just...  Yes.  Yes, I own one.  I could procure that for you.  Now that's how you executive produce.  That's how you executive produce.  Ah, wow.  Damn.  This is really confusing.  Yeah, this is...  So I don't know what you two are all about.  If there's a relationship here, if it's salvageable, if you're just cohabitating. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, wait, we almost forgot too.  So Clarence from, what's his name?  Clarence something from Citizen Culp?  Oh, yeah.  You get hit on by celebrities in the Hamptons?  What?  You get hit on by celebrities in the Hamptons?  I don't get hit on by them.  No?  They ask you out?  No.  The Sex and the City guy.  Oh, that wasn't in the Hamptons.  That was at Bloomingdale's.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Okay.  So, well, when you're out, you get approached by men, right? 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  And they try to, you know, pick up on you and stuff like that?  Yeah.  Do you tell them I have a boyfriend?  Yeah, of course.  Oh, you do?  Yes.  All the time?  Every time.  And you give them your number, but for what reason?  I don't give anyone my phone number that isn't, like, a friend.  Oh, like Troy.  Troy's a friend.  Troy doesn't have my phone number.  Not yet he doesn't.  Yeah, he's a friend.  Although we now have your phone number because we called you. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, shit.  So Troy could have your phone number.  Wow.  And I don't know if we told you officially, but Troy definitely wants to have sex with you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's been out of the loop for a while.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Troy has a five-week load buildup.  Five week?  Well, it's a lot longer than that.  Oh, really?  Are you familiar with the program and all the principal players of the Opie and Anthony  show?  Yes.  All right. 
[02:15:30]  Who, if you had to, would you fuck from this show?  Sean.  Sean, the intern.  Don't you?  All right.  That's who I would choose also.  Besides Sean, you can't pick Sean.  Who would be the person that you would have sex with?  Well, the only person I've seen pictures of, really like an okay picture, is Troy's Facebook,  but I haven't seen the rest of you yet. 
[02:16:00]  You haven't?  That's an advantage for me, definitely.  You haven't shown her pictures of the members of the Opie and Anthony show?  Sam.  Oh, well, so much for me then.  Yeah.  So much for me.  What do you think of Sam?  He's not a candidate to have sex with, is he?  Hmm?  She doesn't date the colored.  Sam is not a candidate for you to sleep with from the show.  Oh, thanks.  Sam's best friend, right? 
[02:16:30]  Well, I don't know.  I mean, you don't remember Sammy's the guy with the Mad Magazine feet and fucking Thelma  from Good Times Hair?  I think she saw my feet.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I think we did it.  Yeah.  I don't know what else to ask.  We like you very.  She's very funny.  She's open.  At least she's a ball buster.  She's a cool girl.  Sean mentioned choking.  You guys kind of.  Yeah, that's right.  You get into autoerotic asphyxiation or, you know. 
[02:17:00]  A little bit.  A little bit?  Choke or you're being choked?  Yeah.  What do you do?  You like being choked when you're having sex?  Yeah.  Sometimes he'll choke me with one hand.  Not like, you know, to the point I pass out or anything.  But sometimes he'll choke me with one hand, but then he'll slap my breath.  If that's the equivalent to slapping my ass, I feel.  Ew, you slapper tits.  Do you just find that ridiculous?  You slap her tits? 
[02:17:30]  Sean, it hurts.  Sean, I'm not willing to give up yet.  What happened to you as a kid?  What are you doing?  I choked her.  What's wrong with it?  What's right with it?  You don't slap tits?  Everyone knows you give her a fucking slap to the face.  Hell yeah.  Or you fucking grab her tits or pinch her in it.  You don't slap her tits?  Really, Sean?  What happened as a kid?  I heard a whole, you know, thing rough with each other.  He slaps him like you're playing Hungry, Hungry Hippo.  Sorry.  I talked over your head.  Cad, Sean, what happened as a kid? 
[02:18:00]  What are you willing to say?  I had the best childhood.  Uh-huh.  Best parents.  But?  Nothing went wrong.  Nothing went wrong that you're either A, willing to admit, or B, know of.  Kenny said what?  Nothing.  Sean just said, I had the best childhood.  And Kenny said, of course.  Implying that there was sexual activity.  Danny found some tits slapping videos.  Of course he did. 
[02:18:30]  She's slapping them like they're a punchline.  That's fucking hot, actually.  So, Sean will slap your tits.  Now, you obviously don't like that.  Do you tell him?  Like, how do you tell him you don't like that?  Well, it's fine if he, like, he just slap grabs them, which I'm okay with.  But, like, one time he just, like, wailed on them.  And I was like, no, not okay.  Not all right.  Like, bitch slapped it?  She's like, why do you have these?  Does he make this noise? 
[02:19:00]  He slaps it like Mrs. Kittner slapped Brody.  God damn, Sean.  What the hell is going on with you?  We still haven't learned anything about this kid.  That was a hell of a slap.  Oh, boy.  She was angry.  I hope they got that in one take.  Wow.  She cracked him in the face. 
[02:19:30]  So, she doesn't like that.  You like the choking, though, huh?  Yeah.  That's a little odd.  The choking's, yeah, the choking's.  Not like, not choking hard.  Yeah, just kind of hand around your neck a little bit.  Yeah.  I'm usually the one dominating him.  Do you like dominating him, or are you bored with that?  Well, I was really into it for a while, and I still do it.  Yeah.  But I really like to be dominated, so he's been getting more into that. 
[02:20:00]  Okay, good.  Oh, really?  All right.  Would you be open to, you know, flipping over on your stomach and having him do you that  way?  Yeah.  You know, I mean, not just do you that way, but I mean backdoor action.  You know, where the poo comes out.  Right.  I know what you mean.  And yes, I've actually mentioned it, but he's like, that's gay.  That's gay.  So, I was like, all right.  What?  That's gay.  That's gay.  He was looking into a mirror.  I think he's scared that he might be gay. 
[02:20:30]  I think he's fighting it.  Yeah.  So, he's like, I don't want any.  Like, she's up for taking in the shitter, and you're saying that's gay, yet you're dabbing  your own cum and licking it.  Exactly.  And you won't go down on a girl's pussy.  And you're slapping breasts because they make you angry.  But you're not gay.  I do want to fucking pull a Moe Howard on her tits.  Right.  He's testing cum like at the end of Goodfellas.  Bye-bye, asshole. 
[02:21:00]  You hear that guy?  Yes.  In the precinct.  The gang on Twitter started a new game, I Wouldn't Turn Down a BJ.  And this one just came in from Wet Oreo.  I wouldn't turn down a BJ, even if it meant missing my mother's funeral.  Yes.  Wow.  That turning down a BJ thing is going to stay with a lot of people today.  Turn one down at my mother's funeral.  Exactly.  I wouldn't turn one down from my mother at her funeral.  Get it?  I'd fuck her dead mouth. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  There is one more thing, Kat.  Sean says he's one and done.  He's a one and done guy at 21 years old.  That's a little weird to us because we all remember being 21.  And that was almost physically impossible when you were with someone especially you liked.  Yeah.  Wait, what do you mean one and done guy?  He said he fucks you once and then that's it for the night.  He's done.  He's tired. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  Now, what about, you know, because guys sometimes need a recharge time, but a lot of times, you know, after a little while, maybe you have a drink or something like that or you watch a little TV and then you're right back in the saddle.  Well, Sean doesn't really drink.  Well, the drink really has nothing to do with it.  I mean, even water or something.  Just to give him a recharge period, but he doesn't, like, get recharged and then just want to get right back in there again for another round? 
[02:22:30]  I never.  I stay up late at night hoping that will happen.  Oh.  Yeah.  Let's now go right to Troy.  I'm living.  And, Troy, especially with a new girl.  What's your record?  What do you think?  In one night, how many times?  Man.  I'm up for probably a good night.  Four times?  Sure.  Four or five, like that.  That's realistic.  That is realistic.  It's like a four or five time if you're going, like, the whole night, having fun with the girl and shit like that. 
[02:23:00]  Breaks in between.  Absolutely.  Four or five times.  Yes.  Yep.  Yep.  And you're both, like, fucking walking like John Wayne the next day.  Exactly.  Yes.  And Sean is what?  Yeah, like there's 20 pounds of food you're calling.  There is.  Sean and you?  Yes, my food.  No, I'm fucking food.  Forget about it.  Sean.  Poor guy.  Sean and you?  I feel bad for him now.  One a night?  What's that?  One a night?  One a night.  Oh.  That's terrible.  Oh, no. 
[02:23:30]  Twice?  Twice?  We're going to go twice?  Come on, come on.  He's done.  He's done fucking her.  And...  Oh, that's it?  Sorry.  Oh, I thought there would be a second one.  There's endless sex.  It was supposed to be that, but...  Actually, this is a clip we have of Sean after he's had sex with the cat. 
[02:24:00]  Now go home and get your fucking shine box.  Oh, see?  Oh, that's good.  Oh.  I'm breaking your balls on you, right away you're getting fucking fish.  Oh.  And, uh...  Here's cat, her response.  We're cakes for nothing!  Oh.  Oh.  Loser.  Oh, man.  You are one pathetic loser.  And here's...  Oh, here's Troy, uh...  Oh.  After going out with a cat, yeah. 
[02:24:30]  Hey, everybody!  We're all going to get laid!  Yay!  Yay!  We have a winner.  We've got a winner!  Yeah.  Yeah.  We have a winner.  We do have a winner.  My God.  P.S.  I am gay.  Oh.  That's back to Sean. 
[02:25:00]  Eight simple words.  I am gay.  Oh.  Back to Sean.  And here's, uh, Sean when, uh, Cat wants to actually have some oral sex.  Uh, give him some oral sex.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  Oh.  Actually, Anthony, I got Sean, uh, looking at Cat's pussy.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Wait a minute.  Here's Cat, and she's talking about why Sean won't, uh, go down on her.  All right.  He said, I can smell your cunt. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, wow.  That's just rude.  Why won't you go down on her?  No.  My health doesn't allow it.  Oh, boy.  That's terrible.  That's terrible.  Poor Sean.  Yeah.  Sean looks like he's just taking a beating.  Well, you said you'd fuck his girlfriend a couple times.  It's all in good fun, though.  Yeah.  It's his axe.  You get nothing!  You lose!  Good day, sir!  Oh.  Wow.  Very old clip of, uh, Sean's a priest.  Ever seen a grown man naked?  Oh, that's from when he was molested. 
[02:26:00]  What?  Oh, God.  Oh, you like that, don't you, faggot?  Oh.  Wow, that's sad.  Terrible.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, it happens, though.  Oh, wait.  I don't know.  Hold on.  I, uh, let me see.  Goddamn rich cunt!  Any comments, anybody?  No.  I have this. 
[02:26:30]  This might be Kat.  What happened?  What happened?  Well, Jimmy knows a little something about Sean's ball sack.  He stinks, and I don't like it.  Oh.  Oh, how did that happen?  What do you do for a living, character?  What does that even mean?  I don't know.  I just like it.  I just like that one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Of course, Sean.  And here's that cat again.  You want to eat me?  Then go ahead! 
[02:27:00]  Do it!  Go ahead and eat me!  Go ahead!  Wow.  Choke on me!  She sounds angry there.  You're not...  For many days, I didn't bring him here because I suffer when he bites me.  He bite me in my vagina.  Oh, you're better than just a bite.  That's not good.  You're not supposed to do that.  I just came to get something to eat!  Oh, no.  Oh, I got Sean, I think, when Kat asked for her vagina to be eaten, I think. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah?  Not me, no way.  Not once, not never.  Oh, damn.  And here's a...  Wow, this is Troy, I guess, when he had a little alone time with Kat.  Oh!  Oh, motherfucker!  Yeah.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Yeah, why don't you?  Uh-oh.  Those men wanted to have sex with me!  Yeah. 
[02:28:00]  I got audio of Sean in the bedroom.  This is a little weird.  Yeah?  Yeah.  My name is William, and I like to wear dresses.  Oh.  My name is William, and I like fingernail polish.  Oh.  Sean's opinion of his sexual prowess isn't very good.  I'm not good.  Oh.  Oh.  I got audio of Sean down there.  Yeah?  In the pussy.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medication's on work. 
[02:28:30]  I've been here for seven years.  Years.  Years.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sean.  That's terrible.  This is horseradish.  You're most likely to have come across it as the powerful paste wasabi that's eaten with sushi.  That's sushi.  We're just finding old clothes we haven't played in a while.  Just go down on her.  Stop whining.  Yes.  Oh, what?  What?  What?  He's a fan.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Sean. 
[02:29:00]  Sean.  I love you, Journey Cakes.  Oh, no.  Come on.  That's terrible.  Gay, Sean.  Oh.  Damn.  He went down on it, but had a few regrets.  I'm sorry I did that.  Sometimes I'm a bad boy, yeah.  Oh, I love it.  Who's this guy that's the last guy she had sex with?  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Oh, wow.  She enticed me.  Yeah.  Did she?  Well, why don't you?  Mm-hmm. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, God.  Sean.  This is when Sean just first smelt it.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Whoa.  I got audio of the first time Kat pulled her pants down.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  Yeah.  That's rough.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't stop treating me like, oh. 
[02:30:00]  What?  Something she's never going to say.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah, see, we could go that way with that one.  That's terrible.  You ever suck a guy's cock?  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  The last time I'm going to ask you.  Troy.  It's great like that.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, I got one, too.  I bet he never said, was beauty killed this beast.  All right.  It's over.  That's it.  Why don't you just hear some words of wisdom? 
[02:30:30]  The attitude dictates that you don't care whether she comes, stays, lays, or prays.  I mean, whatever happens, your toes are still tapping.  Hey.  This is great iced tea.  Hey, this is great iced tea.  That's going to be Troy in the fucking pool house.  Oh, and then he fucks it.  Only it's going to last a lot longer.  And someone's watching Sean try to eat cat's pussy.  Oh, that's terrible.  Oh, no.  That's terrible.  That's just awful.  What a trooper cat is.  And you shouldn't be so demanding in bed. 
[02:31:00]  Call me sir, goddammit.  Pitted.  So pitted.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to kiss you on the mouth.  Do you want to kiss me?  Wait, did Sean get the job done?  He's got it.  And down he goes at the five yard line.  What's the call here?  Now they're going to say no.  He's out of bounds.  Oh, see.  You can get a doggy style.  You can get a lean on your side. 
[02:31:30]  Those are your only choices.  This is my house and I get the same.  Oh, fuck.  What's wrong with you?  Oh, well.  She's just like, at this point.  I'm about to strangle you out of your own consciousness.  Oh, you're getting a grade for your pussy eating?  You folks fell on your face.  You get an F minus in my book.  Oh, that's a low grade.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, she sounds like a wonderful girl.  Yes.  I'd be very pained to lose her, as you seem to be.  Kat, any chance getting back?  Well, there's always a chance.  I just need to clear the hole.  Natalie's rebounding.  I'm so sorry for that.  He's sorry about the Natalie.  Man up. 
[02:32:30]  Wait.  I thought she stopped at I need to clear the hole.  Oh, no.  No.  That is.  That would.  No.  Wait.  How come you want him to.  If you hooked up, why couldn't he have hooked up?  Good question, Jimmy.  That's true.  That's true.  Comment.  So you don't respect him because he.  Like when you when you come at him with that, he apologizes.  What he should tell you, shut up.  You did it.  I did it.  But you don't.  So you don't respect the fact that he fucking buckles.  No, no.  See, this is the thing.  When I did that, we weren't talking and we were broken up for three months. 
[02:33:00]  This has been the past like two weeks.  And he was talking to me about how we were going to get together like the same day.  That's the only reason.  Oh, OK.  And he was grabbing a handful of fucking tit.  Yeah.  What's that?  Cup in that breast.  Cup in the breast.  If he I feel like if he what you call it, if he didn't find out that Natalie was a little  bit more batshit crazy than I am and talking to her anymore, I feel like he would be like 
[02:33:30]  like if she didn't find out about that living together and whatnot, that he would still be  pursuing her.  So I just wanted to think about that.  Like, because if he would be still with her, you know what I mean?  Then why is he going to get back with me?  Did he steal something?  Oh, that's inappropriate.  It was a black gentleman running.  I didn't even see it, but it must have been a black gentleman running.  Stanley T from the Morning Mash show just ran by our studio at quite the pace.  Kenny almost instinctively got up to tackle him. 
[02:34:00]  Go and grab some mashed potatoes from the mashup.  Cat.  Cat.  This is what we do.  What did Sean do with Natalie?  Cup to breast.  I got it, because we need an ending to this.  There was just a breast cupping?  What didn't he do with Olivia?  All right.  I didn't say a word.  Hold on.  So I'll get it.  Hold on, because I think I'm onto something here. 
[02:34:30]  So what did he do with Natalie that you can't get over?  No, no, no.  I can get over the whole, what he did Natalie.  That was my fault, because I'm the one who lied to him in the first time.  All right, but we need you two.  Believe it or not, we need you two back together.  So this is what I suggest.  You come in, and we do a little dating thing, and you and Sean decide which guy you could  have a little fun with, just to get back at Sean, and then it'll be okay, and you guys  are back together.  Yes.  Would you be up for that? 
[02:35:00]  I'll come in, but I don't know about fucking another guy.  I didn't say fucking.  No, no.  I didn't say fucking.  Maybe a little blowjob.  What happened if this?  How about if somebody just puts their mouth by your breast and goes, he-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li.  Or smacks him.  Yeah.  Just smacks him.  You seem to like that.  How about if somebody treats your tits like an MMA opponent?  All right, I don't think they're going to go for the dating thing.  That would be pretty good, though, if you and Sean decide which guy you could fool around with a little bit. 
[02:35:30]  What about a date?  No fucking or anything.  You know, just go out, get to know somebody else, see if you're attracted to somebody.  How about that?  That's what I told him to do, and now he's like, oh, well, it's fine.  We were going to get back together anyway, and I was like, what?  But, like, he was interested in someone else, so obviously he couldn't be interested in another someone else.  You know what I mean?  Right.  Like, he should figure that out before he wants to be back in a relationship. 
[02:36:00]  See, but you should see what it's like to just, you know, go out on a date with somebody that probably treats you a little nicer and is a little more attentive.  And I don't even mean sexually, just to your needs as far as a night out, having fun, treating you like a lady, things like that.  A guy on the west side of Manhattan, not someone that's just going to throw money at you.  What are you suggesting?  Watch a movie in a movie theater without any other people in it.  Nah, we're just getting oral sex while looking at signed Aussie photos. 
[02:36:30]  You know, you should just kind of look at your options out there before you commit back to Sean.  Exactly.  That's all we're saying.  Well, I think Sean should do the same, though.  We agree.  All right.  Okay.  Sean can also pick a guy from the staff that he would like to date.  Yes, exactly.  He'll do the same exact thing.  Yeah, Sean, let me ask you, honestly, not that you're gay, but if you had to put your mouth around the penis of one staff member, it would be Sam? 
[02:37:00]  Wow, Jesus, could you let me finish?  He did not even fucking wait.  Why Sam?  Yeah, what about Sam?  Well, we're like the same proportion.  Yeah, so it's almost like you'd be sucking your own dick.  Two twinks.  It's very uncomfortable for me.  But would you kiss Sam or twinks?  I'd film it and make a lot of money, twink fucking porn.  Would you kiss Sam or would you just suck his dick or would you start off on his neck?  Sam.  I don't think Kat would let me kiss Sam.  Well, Sam, how many guys have you kissed so far, Sam?  Not so far, total end of it was, I quit at three, I retired. 
[02:37:30]  How about a peck between you?  Yeah, would you be up for one more while Kat's on the phone?  I gotta, no, because there's also another female party that we're not considering who I've gotten into a lot of trouble with three times.  Oh.  Can't do that again.  You really can't.  How about just a quick peck?  That charade is still going on?  What about, what about a shirtless, what about a shirtless hug with Sean?  Damn it, that's exactly what we need.  I'll be, this is not right. 
[02:38:00]  How about a pantsless hug?  How about a shirtless hug?  I got my HD flip out.  Come on.  What are you talking about?  What about a shirtless hug?  Sean, take the shirt off.  Just a hug.  Just a hug.  Yeah, recreate this moment that Danny just pulled up on the monitor.  It's two shirtless boys.  One is cupping the one's peck and has his hand around his waist.  I know where the other guy's hand is, but the picture's kind of cut off there.  And they do seem to be touching lips.  They're kissing there.  Hold on, Kat.  We're going to get these shirts off. 
[02:38:30]  Sean, come on.  Take your shirt off.  Take your shirt off.  I mean, Sean has a career to worry about.  Yeah, take your shirt off.  No, he doesn't.  Believe me.  Go ahead.  Oh, God.  Sean can't get that shirt off.  Let me know that Sean is ready to take his shirt off.  I take Sam's shirt off.  What are you talking about?  God damn it.  Sean knows how to do radio.  Sean, you know what?  You're going to be hired by the end of the year.  You know how much money Eric got to eat his favorite food?  And I'm going to do this for free?  That's the beauty of you.  That's the pleasure of it.  It's just for the pleasure of it.  And for the show.  I'm not going to allow this confused. 
[02:39:00]  For the show.  For the show.  For the show.  For the show.  For the show.  For the show.  And we'll throw in a no homo.  No problem.  No, here's the problem.  No homo and for the show.  No homo doesn't apply with somebody who obviously has confused sexuality.  Look what happened to loyalty since he's got three fucking radio shows.  Sean, let's do this.  That's nice.  I'm down.  Sean, no more loyalty.  Sean, you want to be hired by the Opie and Anthony show?  Yes.  All right.  It'll help your cause if you take your shirt off right now.  Let's do it.  Look how exciting it is.  Come on, Sam. 
[02:39:30]  Sam, get up there.  Come on.  Sean getting excited is not motivating me.  Sean, take your shirt off.  No, he's got to take each other.  I like Sean's idea.  Take each other's shirts off.  He's got to be much sexier.  Sean's not going to touch me.  Sam, headphones off.  Stand up.  This is for the show, Sam.  What's wrong with you?  He rocked mayo and puked.  Headphones off.  The least you can do is let Sean take your shirt off.  Yeah, come on.  The least you can do is get everybody's dick hard.  Take that fucking headphone off.  Take the headphones off.  Stop using the mic as a fucking guard.  Stop hiding behind the mic.  Yeah, which you can do literally.  Exactly.  He's not going to touch me.  He's taking his shirt off. 
[02:40:00]  Now I'm going to hold the mic.  He's not touching you.  He's taking your shirt off.  Come on.  All right.  For the show, Sam.  Yeah.  Could you go to the side a little bit?  You know what?  For the show.  There's more than one twink that works on this show, and this twink has done a lot more than  the other twink.  You've kissed men.  Yes, I've already kissed men.  You won't just take your shirts off and hug?  No.  Hug it out?  Come on.  Hug it out.  Hug it out.  He shows you.  It's a shirtless hug.  That's the problem.  It's a shirtless hug.  That's the problem here.  Sean, just take your shirt off.  You're comfortable with your sexuality, right, Sean? 
[02:40:30]  Sean said Troy, too.  He likes Troy.  Let me tell you something.  Sean has hung out with Troy.  Sean has Troy's phone number.  If Sean were to go gay, he would absolutely go gay with Troy before me.  Sam, you don't do stuff for the show anymore.  No, he's gone for Sam.  What are you going to make me feel guilty about?  You don't do stuff for the show anymore.  Cat, what are you saying?  Cat always talks about Troy.  He always talks about Troy.  He's very attracted to Troy.  He was so quick to tell Sam. 
[02:41:00]  Do you know why he said my name?  Because he's legitimately attracted to Troy.  It would be uncomfortable for him.  Troy's going to do a shirtless hug with somebody in the room.  Yes, Troy's never done anything for the show, and he's trying to make his mark.  If Sam goes shirtless, gives a shirtless hug, I'll jump in the middle shirtless.  That's not gay, because there's three people in the room.  Troy and Sean have to start this thing.  Come on, Sam.  I've done more than shirt Troy heads.  I don't believe Sam pussies out like that.  Troy's the new kid.  Did you see what E-Rock did?  Yeah, E-Rock fucking rocked for the show. 
[02:41:30]  He ate his favorite food.  Well, that's a good point.  And he vomited it up.  Yeah, I ate bad food last week.  All right, come on.  How are we going to get this going?  Troy and Sean will do it.  It started with you.  I got it.  Go ahead.  Cat, what guy does Sean talk about?  You didn't even know who I was when my name was brought up.  Sam is fucking panicking.  He is really trying to debate his way out of this motherfucker.  It's just a shirtless hug.  That's all we're asking.  Come on, it's a shirtless hug.  She didn't even know what my name was, and Sean lives with her.  If Sean gives Sam a shirtless hug, I'll give Troy a shirtless hug. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah!  That's a terrible deal.  That's a great deal.  No, Sean has to give Troy a shirtless hug for Troy to earn his shirtless hug with Cat.  I agree with all that.  That's fair.  I want to see Sam first, though.  Sam's got to take the shirt off.  No, no, no.  I'm not going first.  Just take your shirt off.  Sean, you've got to get the shirt off.  Go ahead, Sean.  All right, Sean.  Sean is shirtless.  No, I'm not doing this.  I'm sitting down now.  This is awful.  Sam, come on.  Troy, you take one for the team. 
[02:42:30]  I'm going to put you out.  It started with you.  You take off your shirt.  I'll jump in the middle.  Come on, Sam.  I'm shirtless hugging everybody.  For the show.  Yeah.  For the show.  You're fucking un...  That's right.  You're disloyal.  Why are you panicking?  You're disloyal.  Back in the old days, you would have done it for Scorch.  Don't touch me.  Don't touch me.  I would never have done anything for Scorch, for the record.  Hey, take your shirt off.  Troy, would you do a shirtless hug?  I said it.  We need an ending to this bitch.  This is what the deal is.  This is what the deal is.  I just said no to the deal.  Pretty fucking gay.  It started.  It started.  Sam.  I'll jump in.  Wow, we're getting some music.  Jesus, what the fuck's wrong with you turning down the lights, you fucking weirdo? 
[02:43:00]  I'm already a disappointment.  You got to go for it, Troy.  No, go ahead, man.  It's all you.  Pretend we're at the beach.  I've never gone to the beach with you.  Sam, what's wrong with you?  It's Troy on this one.  No, I'm not.  I'm sick.  What happened to Sean's chest?  Look at Troy examining his chest and stuff.  No, but look at it.  It's indented.  Show up what they're supposed to look like, Troy.  It's called being in shape.  He's in a way.  Is it?  And Troy is single.  He's got nothing to lose.  Troy, go show it.  Troy's doing this.  Show him your man at least. 
[02:43:30]  How about you just take your shirt off, Troy?  I'd like to see how well built you up.  Take your shirt off, Troy.  No, that's all right.  Come on, you're in good shape.  Sam.  Go ahead.  You do it.  You do it.  Big man.  Mr. Tats.  Mr. Rockstar.  You do it.  Wow.  Sam, you really are in a bad spot right now.  Sam is trying so hard to get out of this.  A lot of people say you haven't done much for the show lately.  Yeah, people can say whatever they want.  They're really saying that out there.  I'm not concerned with what people are saying.  Look what E-Rock just did.  E-Rock.  Go through history.  I've done plenty of stuff.  I've taken a dildo to the mouth. 
[02:44:00]  I've done it.  I've done my part.  So why is this bad?  Because I've already paid my dues.  It's a shirtless hug.  No kissing.  You're doing your don'ts now.  No kissing.  Just a hug.  Just a hug.  A shirtless hug.  And there's that video of the kisses.  A kiss is much worse than a hug.  Not to me.  Oh, yes.  A kiss.  How about a kiss?  No, not a kiss.  How about a kiss?  This turned gay really quick.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And Troy has never done anything.  Never done anything.  Troy, quick shirtless hug. 
[02:44:30]  Quick.  If I give him a shirtless hug, you will then?  Yeah.  No, you won't.  No, don't lie.  I can't lie.  Don't fucking lie.  I'm not going to.  Regardless, I'm not going to.  I'll shirtless hug him first, but you take off your shirt and get ready for the shirtless hug.  I just said I was lying.  I'm not going to shirtless hug him.  Why not?  What's wrong with you guys?  Troy, your credit with the show will go way up.  Shirtless hug.  And you've got none right now.  It's a hug.  And Sam's fucking stock is dropping.  I see my girl's asshole.  Sam's stock is dropping like yesterday.  Like yesterday, exactly.  Yeah, that's where my stock is yesterday.  Someone sold a billion shares of Sam. 
[02:45:00]  Travis, show Sam that you're a real man and you can do a shirtless hug and it's no big deal.  Exactly.  Is that what's going on?  Yeah.  All right.  You're not paying attention?  Oh, shit.  No, I am.  Is that what are you, Steve C.?  We're resending.  We've been in break for a long time, so we're just resending the bad data and having a conversation  about that.  What do you mean we've been in break?  No, I think it means we've gone without a break.  Like this segment is two hours long.  Oh, I know it's two hours long.  Two hours long.  We're not going to break in two hours.  Oh, we're not going to break in two hours.  For the gayest radio ever. 
[02:45:30]  We suck.  All right, should we?  Oh, my fucking.  You're lucky my flip is done.  Oh, we can still do it for the race.  You want batteries?  No.  Well, get me fucking batteries.  How do we?  Travis.  We can't get a shirtless hug on this show?  We can get Travis to do it.  All right, hold on.  Don't do the shirtless hug until I can find some room on my goddamn.  Travis will do it.  Sam's not going to con me into taking his place.  Travis is going to make me look like a pussy.  Now, Biff, don't con me.  Sean said Sam, so Sam is the one. 
[02:46:00]  Troy is the one who's in the middle of this whole thing.  There's no Sam here.  There is a Sam here.  We have to break, so you've got to do the shirtless hug.  You were the one that said he wanted to be with you.  Yeah, but he was lying because he actually wants to be with Troy, and he's uncomfortable.  You know something?  You could keep saying that all you want.  No one believes it.  We don't believe it.  He wants to be.  And what's Steve doing in here?  Yes.  What do you think?  I just wanted to watch.  You were bringing batteries?  I haven't seen you all morning, but, man, you were quick with the batteries. 
[02:46:30]  That psycho hairdo Steve has.  Wow.  What the hell are you doing?  Private pile.  Yeah.  Private pile of shit.  It's low maintenance.  He just shakes his head and goes, uh, uh.  Come on, Sam.  You're fucking up the show.  Fuck that.  You're fucking up the show.  Fuck it.  Come on, Sam.  Oh, good.  A hug.  Well, you know something?  Opie.  Yeah.  I think, uh, if we go to management and maybe say that Sam's, uh, show that he does, what's 
[02:47:00]  that show you do?  Which one?  On Hits One?  Yeah.  Series XM Hits One.  Yeah, yeah.  That show that you're doing is kind of interfering with your input on this program.  Oh, wow.  I think they would take you off the air, lickety fucking split.  And believe me, we will do it.  I know you will.  Game on.  That's a risk I'm willing to take.  New batteries on the flip.  Okay.  A risk.  Other than giving him a fucking, a quick shirtless hug.  Wait, why is your shirt back on?  Because it's cold. 
[02:47:30]  Sam, it's cold, right?  We can't, we got a break.  I know.  That's why Troy's got to get us something done here today.  Please.  I'll shirtless hug him if I can fuck his girlfriend.  Yeah, that's fair.  Oh, okay.  That's not a bad idea.  Is she still on the line?  No.  Is she still on the line?  Yeah.  All right, Sean, take your shirt back off.  She's listening.  I'll take one for the L.P. Anthony.  She'll take one for the L.P. Anthony.  No, no, no, no.  I'll take my shirt off.  And I'll shirtless hug you, but I need your permission to fuck your girlfriend.  I can't give you that permission. 
[02:48:00]  Just say yes for the radio.  For the show.  Jesus Christ.  God, this is like our contract negotiations.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Can anything just eatmen fucking up?  Yeah.  Eatmen drops in.  Let's do this.  But we, we, we.  No, no, no.  What?  Oh.  I tried.  I tried.  I wanted to.  I'm not taking off the fucking shirt.  Can you take off mine?  No.  Just take the shirt off, Troy.  Come on.  No, get the fuck out of here.  This is so gay.  Oh.  This is so gay.  Now, Sam, get in there.  Get in there, Sam.  Come on, Sam. 
[02:48:30]  There.  It's a rape.  I'm good.  It's a rape.  He's taking a shirt off.  Troy.  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  Get his shirt.  Not today.  God damn.  Not today.  Why are you so shy today, Sam?  Why are you so shy?  I'm not shy.  I'm not going to take my shirt off and hug a probably gay man.  But you've kissed guys before?  And I'm gay.  And put a dildo in your mouth.  Come on.  He's got a girlfriend.  She's on the phone.  And every time it's come back to haunt me.  Has it?  What?  Yes, it has.  It's never turned out well.  What, AIDS?  I've never gained anything from them ever.  You get credibility on the show. 
[02:49:00]  No, I don't.  I get sound clips of saying that I'm gay.  And there's another one.  Come on.  It's been done.  There's your ending.  No, no.  You need to do it.  No, it really wasn't a good ending for some reason.  That was like this double standing in.  He was a stand-in for you right there.  So the blocking is all right.  Did you see how quick it was over?  It was two seconds.  It's painless.  Yeah, but the problem is that it lives forever.  For the show.  On the internet.  For the show.  For the show.  I tried that.  For the show. 
[02:49:30]  For the show.  For the show.  For the show.  For the show.  For the show.  For the show.  Oh, my God.  You tried it already.  You know what?  Persona non grata.  Fair enough.  That's how I'm feeling about you right about now.  Fair enough.  You know what?  You don't want to contribute to the show anymore.  That's fine.  That's fine.  Fair enough.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Morris, what about you? 
[02:50:00]  Just instantly get some other whore.  God, it would have been so good to call him a faggot, too.  It would have been so great the second he did it to just call Sam a faggot.  Of course.  Well, Kat, we'll have to have you come in studio soon.  You're definitely a trooper, and you hung in patiently on the phone.  So, we'd love to meet you and have you come in maybe next week sometime.  Sure.  I'm down.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Thanks for being so cool on the phone.  Oh, wait. 
[02:50:30]  We got Bob Levy?  Hold on.  I'm going to go pee.  Hold on.  We got Bob Levy that's been waiting for like an hour here.  Bob, you're on with Kat.  You got Sean in the studio.  What's going on, buddy?  I was actually calling it Natalie, but you guys fucked it up.  Oh, really?  Oh, I see that.  Oh, fuck.  I fucked up.  Bob was going to be Natalie.  God damn it.  Sorry, Bob.  Oh, well.  But make him hug.  Make him kiss, man.  He's already gay.  He tasted his own cum. 
[02:51:00]  Might as well taste another man's cum.  Sean had no problem doing the naked man hug.  Of course he didn't.  And Troy had no problem.  It was Sam that had the problem this time.  Because Sam becomes gay stunt boy all of a sudden, and we're going to nip that in the  butt.  All right, Bob.  We'll talk to you soon, and I guess we've got to let Kat go.  Kat, thank you.  No problem.  Thanks, Kat.  All right.  We'll see you soon.  Sean, thank you.  I don't know what we accomplished here, but...  Gayness.  A lot of gayness.  We got us closer to the weekend. 
[02:51:30]  I know that much.  And that in itself is quite an accomplishment.  Troy, thank you.  Great appearance, Sam.  Disappointed.  Sam.  Sam.  I just got to say, yeah.  Disappointment.  Sorry to disappointment.  For not being as gay.  I think your stock dropped a little today.  Just a little bit.  I think it did.  A little bit.  I think it did.  And Troy is, you know, his stock has skyrocketed.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm happy to see other people's success, so I'm okay with that.  Oh, is that it?  Yep. 
[02:52:00]  All right.  We're going to listen to Anthony do about eight Mother's Day rinks.  It's Mother's Day.  They get flower, chocolate, strawberry, gold, rose things.  All right.  The Opie and Anthony show will return momentarily.  Until then, take a walk down the hall of the old Mrs. Henderson's room and introduce  her to the perks of nursing home life.  And how are we doing today?  Oh, hello, Russell.  Hello.  That's it.  Don't struggle.  You're only making things worse. 
[02:52:30]  Ah, now isn't that better?  The Virus, Sirius 197, XM202.  Hey.  It's just hard for me to grab the headphones and swing the mic over again.  Woo-hoo!  It's Mother's Day this Sunday.  Ah!  Oh, that?  Ah, yeah.  Did you know that?  Ah, a very important question. 
[02:53:00]  What'd you get last year for mom?  And you don't remember because it sucked.  Ah, Mother's Day, Sunday, perfect gift.  Steven Singer's famous 24-carat gold dipped roses.  They last forever.  It's not a gift she's going to just look at and go, oh, thanks.  Won't have to throw it away.  She's going to display that thing proudly and say, look what my child got me.  24-carat gold.  Real gold.  Real roses dipped in it. 
[02:53:30]  They last forever.  And they're only 59 bucks.  Not too expensive.  What is that?  Let me see that, Jimmy.  What was that?  59 bucks.  They're full of meaning and love.  Oh, God.

[02:57:00]  Let's do this.  Finally back.  Sorry about that.  We did two hours of radio, so we had to make up some lost time there with about 18 live  reads from Anthony about Mother's Day.  Yes, Anthony.  I want to apologize to Steven Singer.  Why?  Why would you ever apologize to that fucking asshole?  I kind of lost it back there a few minutes ago.  I have some kind of post-traumatic stress disorder from these reads, and I did. 
[02:57:30]  I lost it, but I'm okay now.  And I just want to apologize to Steven Singer for that last read.  He's a wonderful man we've met, and his products are fantastic, and I endorse them for Mother's Day.  Do you really think he's a wonderful guy?  No!  All right, good.  Pete Townsend was cleared of child porn possession charges seven fucking years ago already.  That was seven years already?  Hence a little Eminence front in the background.  Yeah. 
[02:58:00]  And congratulations to Trap Dogs fucking Canadians.  What a great hockey game last night.  What a great game.  What a great series.  Who am?  The Canadians and the Penguins are tied at two.  Two games apiece in this wonderful playoff series.  Going back to Pittsburgh this weekend, right, Travis?  Yeah, Saturday night.  That could be trouble for him.  Fucking hanging tough.  Playing pretty good on the road.  Canadians are hanging tough, I must say.  Habs, yeah.  Go Habs, go.  Habs, go Habs.  And Wings beat the Sharks, I guess.  Someone cares about that.  Sharks lead the series three games to one, so there you go. 
[02:58:30]  Iron Man 2 out today.  70% positive reviews on RottenTomatoes.com, Anthony.  How many?  70%.  Oh.  On Rotten Tomatoes.  So, yeah, Iron Man 2 is going to be good.  Yeah, the trailer looks pretty cool, and it just looks like one of those movies that's  going to make a fortune opening weekend.  Just know it.  Yeah, it's just one of those no-brainer films, so.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And what else?  Betty White on SNL. 
[02:59:00]  Is she good?  She's going to.  She's going to be.  All right.  Tomorrow night.  Yep.  And finally, Chaz Bono, legally a man.  Finally, huh?  A man after Judge Grant's name and gender change.  She's been on TV lately.  She looks exactly like she did before she went through all this.  I know.  That is a ridiculous sex change.  I think she got ripped off.  Because if nothing happened.  I think she got ripped off.  You've been robbed, bitch.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  What?  Same person, right?  Just look.  Is that?  All right.  She's fucking horrendous looking, man. 
[02:59:30]  Let's play.  What's the new name?  Nice Guy Eddie?  Let's play.  My daddy.  Yeah.  You quit pointing that penis at my mom.  She's a good singer.  Danny, let's quickly play Man or Woman.  You show us a picture of Chaz Bono.  We have to figure out if it's before or after the sex change.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Let's try to do this legit.  Okay.  Wasn't she cute when she was really young?  When she was a little kid on the Sonny and Cher Nitty Gritty Hour, whatever it was called. 
[03:00:00]  It was their little variety show.  They'd bring her out.  Okay.  And she was a cute little kid.  Danny's just a picture of Chaz Bono.  We have to figure out if that's before or after the sex change or the name change or the gender change.  Whatever the fuck.  Fuck.  I can't even tell.  I would guess.  Oh, stop.  This is a trick.  That's Ralphie Mae. 
[03:00:30]  You're squinting like you're not going to be able to tell.  I would just, I would say after.  That's before.  Just as a guess.  Because of the tits before.  Danny?  Does Danny know?  It's going to be hard to figure this out.  Oh, we don't have any.  Yeah.  Oh.  Hang on.  I mean, let's see when this article is run.  Hold on a second.  I guess it doesn't matter.  I mean, that's got to be before.  That's before?  Yeah.  That's October 30th, 2009.  So that's before, right? 
[03:01:00]  That's in the middle.  Well, that's during?  I think, yeah.  The last six months she's kind of been going through this.  What does she do about a cock?  They fucking fashion something out of some thigh meat or something?  There's enough pubis fat to mush it.  To fashion it like Play-Doh into a dick.  It's like making a castle in wet sand.  Trying to get it to just stay up.  All that loose skin.  Get it?  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, fuck it. 
[03:01:30]  So the Chaz thing is done, and we can't tell.  That's the point.  Let me see the girlfriend.  We're going to make.  The girlfriend?  Who was saying it?  Oh, Dr. Ian Smith said she's hot in person.  Wait, is that Chaz there?  Which one?  Up top or no?  That?  Yeah.  Is that her young when she wasn't that fat?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's when she was just a run of the milk dyke.  Yeah, she was already on the way.  Boy, did she get awful.  Oof.  What a fucking fat cell. 
[03:02:00]  Wow, she just morphed into a dude on her own without any fucking drugs or anything.  Go to that one right there.  The horrible one.  No.  She looks nothing like.  Oh, that's before and after.  Oh, God.  Wow.  She's terrible.  Holy shit.  With the crew cut.  She's going to be one of those, too, that grow the beard.  Because they always grow like a big beard.  So they can look more like a man.  Oh, my God.  She looks like a girl there, but just a big ugly one.  What the fuck did God do to her?  She looks nothing like Sonny or Cher.  What happened? 
[03:02:30]  She looks more like Sonny than daughter-y.  She doesn't look like anybody.  Look how cute she was.  A cute little thing.  She's a little funny-looking now that I look.  Yeah.  A little funny-looking?  You were with the funny-looking one.  Iron Man 2 review from Kent the Movie Guy.  All right.  What the hell?  Kent, what do you got on Iron Man 2?  Do they really?  Oh, yeah.  People hate Kent.  Kent is hated.  Despised.  I have no movie review. 
[03:03:00]  Is he really badly hated?  Yes.  Why?  People just hate him.  Fuck Kent.  Kent's a cunt.  Kent knows nothing.  We hate Kent.  Cunt the Movie Guy.  They hate him.  Tell us how you really feel.  Oh, Jim.  Kent sucks cock.  Wow.  I'm muting my radio.  Wow.  Well.  All right.  Never mind, then.  Rotten Tomatoes.  Why?  You don't like? 
[03:03:30]  No, I'm just reading what the listeners say.  1% for Kent.  Yeah, I'm reading what the listeners say.  What, are you going to let them chase you off?  Hello?  Ew.  Hello?  Why are we still looking at pictures of Chaz Bono?  That's Kent?  Oh, I thought it was still Chaz Bono pics.  Holy shit.  And by the way, Ed, you made him feel so bad.  He hung up.  He hung up.  That, you know.  Why?  Did he think I was saying that?  I think you set up your people to say all that while he was on the phone.  Oh, see, that's other pictures of Kent. 
[03:04:00]  Call back some other time.  Kent, call back in a few years.  Hey, Philip Seymour Hoffman, call back.  Why are you guys killing the guy?  You want a movie review?  You want me to give you a movie review?  All he's trying to do is add to the program.  Why are you killing him?  He is adding to the program.  We're getting some good humor out of this.  Yes.  Now, Kent, call back some other time.  Not today, of course.  What is that one where he's got the little thing over his head being mysterious?  What is a...  Oh, he's a horror film. 
[03:04:30]  Horror picture, sorry.  Sorry.  It's a scary picture, Kent.  He's got a lot of different pictures of himself.  He sure does.  As do most pedos.  Oh, there he is.  All right, now.  He's got the attic shirt on.  All right, now.  What does that mean?  He's like a gangster there?  I don't know, but he's frightening me.  Why don't you put up a picture of Kent  and then Jimmy will describe what look he's going for.  All right.  What look is he going for there?  What's he holding?  Some type of Star Wars vehicle. 
[03:05:00]  Kind of like the ironic shocked look.  Oh.  Like, uh-oh.  Oh.  Okay.  Is that the ironic shocked look?  Yeah.  Oh.  Spaceship.  Oh.  Coming at you.  And the spaceship is kind of coming into the cameras.  He's really pushing it toward there.  Almost 3D-ish.  It's kind of his nerd look.  Yeah.  All right.  Give us another one.  Give us another one.  This is, uh...  Hmm.  Let's look at this picture.  This is the guy who's just kind of, uh...  He's got blue hair.  He's bored of it all. 
[03:05:30]  He's kind of Andy Warhol-ish.  Yeah.  You know, meaning that he's gay and has AIDS.  Um...  You know, he's just kind of trying to look, like,  naturally sexy.  Like, this is just...  Like, I'm an edgy, different guy,  and this is just me naturally, sexually staring at the camera.  Yeah, yeah.  No, uh, fronts or face put on here, folks.  Very good.  With the blonde, uh, the blonde hair,  but the blue on top.  The big blue streak in the middle.  B-L-E-W.  Ken Colbeck.  Yeah, some other...  I want to know why, uh...  Colbeck.  You've taken a lot of pictures.  What's this one, Jimmy?  Eh, this is kind of a goofy guy with a, you know, 
[03:06:00]  funny look on his face,  and a weird little kind of white tiger hat.  You know, it's kind of, like, wacky, like,  Nah!  I'm kind of like John Lithgow.  Nah!  He does have a Lithgow face on him.  Yeah, if this picture had a sound,  it would be,  Ah!  This is wacky.  You know, I'm not afraid to get a little nutty here.  The world according to Kent.  Yeah, exactly.  All right, let's find another one.  This kid's crazy.  This is fun, right?  One more.  Mm-hmm.  All right. 
[03:06:30]  Get us a good one.  Well...  Get a good one.  Get a good one.  Come on.  Uh-oh.  How is that?  I got a lot of pictures.  What about him kissing that thing?  What's that about?  Ugly man normally doesn't like to be photographed this much.  Wow.  Aw, look at that from the side.  He's kissing a small dog.  And I guess the image here is that  people who appear to have Down syndrome  don't always frighten small animals.  Oh, my God.  What did he ever do to you?  I happen to like Kent a lot.  But I'm looking at his picture from the side.  Holy shit.  He's got a Truman Capote thing going on there. 
[03:07:00]  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  He's a...  It's a very Down syndrome-y look from the side.  There's almost a Rocky Dennis thing going on there.  What the fuck?  As he's trying to kiss this little puppy.  The name of this photo is  kissing a dog before removing pins from a man.  Oh, my goodness, Kent.  All right.  What about this one, Jimmy?  Oh, here's a little hot chick.  Just an edgy guy with a tattoo holding a drink, 
[03:07:30]  like meeting a chick at a concert.  That's all he is.  You know, this is pretty much just...  I kind of look like Perez Hilton.  You're not too sure if I'm gay or not.  And here's a hot babe in me.  Notice my tattoo and my orange shirt.  I'm wearing a black shirt underneath  to kind of keep man tits in check.  What the fuck?  He just called to give us a review of a movie  a lot of us are going to go check out this weekend.  Oh, shit.  Here's one.  Yeah, Kent's got a lot of crazy...  The one with the hat on, weird. 
[03:08:00]  Ooh.  There it is.  Okay.  This is kind of a guy.  He's just like, you know...  He's just naturally cute.  His hat's tilted a little sideways.  He's not very conventional.  You know, he's got his hand resting on his...  His chin's resting on his finger, like, casually.  Kind of like, you know...  Like, hey, this is just how I am naturally.  He's just kind of hanging loose.  That's hanging loose, Kent.  Yeah.  With his giant glasses.  He has two satellite dishes made of glass over his nose.  That does...  Is the kind of picture that, like, Ricky Gervais would have made, like, his natural-looking 
[03:08:30]  picture in the office, the English office.  Would you come on his glasses?  You couldn't help it if he was in the room.  They'd be all over the place.  His glasses are too big not to come on.  All right.  Let's get another one for you.  Wow.  Let's get another one.  Oh, this is Kent.  He's kind of making, like, the...  Like, he's holding something in his mouth.  What do you think, Kent?  Two balls.  Two balls in his mouth.  I think this is him just having a bunch of fun pictures in a row. 
[03:09:00]  Like, I bet you the next one is different.  You know, these are from the same series.  Just a bunch...  Yeah, there he is.  Hand on the chin again.  He kind of likes to hide the fact that there's approximately eight more below that one chin.  So he kind of puts his hand and finger...  Wow.  Look at different hair.  This is a guy showing you a bunch of his different looks.  Yeah.  Many crazy faces.  Him just clowning around in front of the eye camera.  Oh, you see, you could keep clicking from picture to picture, and it moves.  It morphs, yeah.  It's like, you know, ugly one, ugly two, ugly three, ugly four. 
[03:09:30]  What did he do to you?  I actually do like Kent.  Did he hit on your girlfriend or something?  No, I actually like this guy.  I'm not even kidding.  I really do like...  Kent's getting hammered.  Kent.  Are we done with the pictures?  No, I don't think we've even begun.  Oh, my God.  All right, let's find another one.  Another picture of Kent.  Yeah, uh-oh.  Kent the movie guy.  And this is...  Uh-oh, he's got a lot of crazy ones here.  Uh-oh, what's going on here?  I don't know.  Right now he's...  Oh, Jesus.  Kent is... 
[03:10:00]  Kind of got like a half-smile and thumbs-upping, which is once again in the old Syndrome of  Down collection.  And he has a laundry basket in the background.  Yes.  I don't know why.  Maybe he rifled through them to find the most horrendous clothes possible.  Mission accomplished.  And then the caption is, off to work over a year ago.  So, apparently he works in the douchebag factory.  Wow, I forgot these have captions. 
[03:10:30]  I should start reading the captions.  Off to work over a year ago.  And he's holding two shoes.  He's got a mean look on his face.  This is a Kent that we're not accustomed to.  Yeah, I rock shoes like every day.  Two different shoes, Jimmy.  You're missing that.  Oh, I didn't even notice.  Maybe he has to make a choice.  That's right.  One to look like a queer and one to look like an asshole.  It's up to you.  And he's kind of hiding one eye and his hat's down over his eye.  Kind of a scarier...  Kind of a snarl from Kent, which we're not accustomed to. 
[03:11:00]  Kent, call back.  Yes, sometime in 2025.  Call back.  Ooh.  Oh, God damn.  Oh, wow.  That's the Kent looks a lot like Jim Norton in that picture photo.  That's Kent before he sits on a toilet and shoots himself in skivvies.  That's the Kent pile photo.  All right, listen.  There's chowl out in the movie theater.  What the fuck is that?  A DVD? 
[03:11:30]  Are DVDs allowed on the radio show?  All right, listen.  Because you're too heavy.  Why aren't you stomping private Kent's movie reviews out?  I just got a tweet from Kent.  All right.  And it brings up a bigger issue.  I'm sick of taking the blame for everything that happens on this fucking radio show.  Oh, shit.  Kent, so go fuck yourself.  Oh, no.  Jimmy's attacking you, so fucking give him this shit.  Wow. 
[03:12:00]  So today was just an open day to attack me.  Fucking awesome.  Thanks, Opie.  What the fuck did I have to do with you, cocksucker?  We're individuals on this show.  I'm not taking the blame for every fucking thing that happens on this show.  And that is the Kent from the Bjork fan video where he paints himself many colors and shoots  himself.  Kent, here's how this started.  Ant was reading some negative pal talk feedbacks and we're just teasing you.  Yes.  I had nothing to do with the cocksucker.  Jesus, dude.  How are you a fan of the show and not know that we're just teasing you? 
[03:12:30]  I was reading.  I said people just, oh, the title of this photo.  Oh, my God.  Kent is a photo negative of Kent holding a gun in his mouth.  Yeah.  And the caption is, my brains are still on the ceiling.  Kind of a Lionel Richie vibe.  Oh, yeah.  My brains are on the ceiling.  We're just, his hair is all white.  Again, Warhol-ish.  I call that one the listener's dream.  Yes.  Kent, we're teasing you. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah.  How are you not?  I went to the phone for an actual fucking review for Iron Man 2, asshole.  Anthony started with the fucking comments that he was reading and then Jimmy went with  it.  Yeah.  So fuck you.  Yeah, Kent, what are you so sensitive for?  We're just making fun of you.  You lost your actual ally, dick.  Kevin from Connecticut says, God damn rich, Kent.  He's all mad.  Yeah, Kent.  We're just making fun of you.  Kent, call back.  For Pete's sake.  How can you be that sensitive when you're the movie review guy? 
[03:13:30]  You know the show.  Yeah.  How do you not understand?  Right now, uh-oh.  Kent's got his mouth open and there's one of the imperial things walking towards it.  An at-at.  It has no idea that it might actually be eaten.  Just teasing.  Good golly.  Clank, clank, clank.  Imperials have entered the...  That's all right.  That's all right, Dan.  No loss.  Imperials have entered the base.  Imperials have.  And then static.  I guess it marched into Kent's mouth and was eaten. 
[03:14:00]  Uh-oh.  What's that one where he's holding the glass?  There's someone behind him.  No, no.  Down, Dan.  One down.  Over to the right.  Over to your right.  One over to the right, Kent.  No, over to the orange glass.  Holding the orange glass.  Orange glass right above.  There you are.  Apparently, he's holding an orange glass.  And it's a scary guy.  He has a scary face.  He's probably scared because it's apparently...  Maybe it's a carrot juice and he's not used to drinking a healthier juice.  He's like, grr, I'm going to tough this up.  You know?  I don't know. 
[03:14:30]  There's a man behind him.  Muggsy's behind him.  Yeah.  He's like, Charlie.  Yeah, yeah, see?  Mwah.  So drink your juice.  Mwah.  And he's wearing, yeah, headphones.  Is Kent really mad?  Kent is so fucking pissed right now.  Is he really?  Oh, is he angry?  Why?  Because the listeners were rambling and saying bad things about him, which I was reading.  And then I thought he was just going to do his movie review.  Yeah.  Because he understood.  Oh, there he is wearing a Mountain Dew case on his head. 
[03:15:00]  As a hat.  I mean, I don't think that it should be made fun of.  He's saluting.  I think he's a captain of something, Jimmy.  What would he be a captain of?  It's an old school captain's hat.  The captain and Tun Neal.  The caption is, yes, sir.  And he's, it's a bunch of wacky photos of him in a Mountain Dew case hat.  Yeah. 
[03:15:30]  And it's, the, the, the, the box is ripped in a way where it has a brim, an actual hat brim.  Yeah.  That's curled up like a, uh, an oldie time, uh, English, uh, captain's hat.  That's his, uh, that's what people will say.  Mountain, do a movie review.  So, Kent, how do you not expect us to tease these a little?  He's wearing another one of the Mountain Dew hat and headphones.  Yeah.  Apparently, um, and here's one with the Mountain Dew hats come off and he's, he's holding it 
[03:16:00]  and he's crying.  He's cradling it.  No.  He's crying.  They blew his lid off.  Now he's eating the box.  Yes.  First time ever.  Oh, shit.  Oh, there's some fresh ink.  Oh, he's got kind of a scarier look on his.  A Hellboy.  Brand new tattoo of Hellboy.  Is that a real tattoo?  On his forearm?  Hellboy tattoo. 
[03:16:30]  Okay.  That's pretty good work.  Yeah.  A lot of red.  This is just a, uh, a MacBook photo kind of, of, uh, the Obama kind of effect.  You get the four, yeah, like the quad pics in different colors.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We've all seen them.  Yeah.  We've all done that at the Apple store.  Yeah.  And then here's like a, kind of like a photo negative again.  Gangsta is me with the attic shirt.  He's wearing a Jinx hat.  His hands are up like, yo, what's up?  And I guess because he's negative, he comes out his skin, he comes out black.  And his hat is white. 
[03:17:00]  And he's being a gangster.  Yes.  Yeah.  We're doing a long break on you.  Yes.  Kent, the movie guy.  And Kent, and here's, here's, uh.  Ew.  I think you should call the show and give the Iron Man 2 review.  Just to show that this whole thing is just a fucking bit, Kent.  Come on.  Yeah.  Why don't you just call and give the review?  All right?  Call in.  Because honestly, he saw the movie and, uh, we're all going to see it this weekend.  So.  It's getting 70% positive reviews.  How does he see movies before everybody?  And I want to know.  I bet you there's something wrong with the movie. 
[03:17:30]  And I, I want to know what, what.  Yeah.  All kidding aside.  He saw the movie.  I'd like to know about it.  That's what the whole gist was.  So if you'd call back and give us a movie review, uh, it would be greatly appreciated.  It can't just call back.  Why don't we call him?  Because honestly, Coke Logic is saying it's an honor to be roasted on the show.  Kent should know, uh, uh, should know to like this.  Yeah.  Okay.  It's your turn as the barrel.  So just call and give the Iron Man to review and show everyone you got a sense of humor  and you can take this shit. 
[03:18:00]  Oh, that's that director who we love.  We had him on, uh, Uwe Boll.  Oh, that guy was nuts.  Yeah, he's crazy.  He's a fucking.  What was his movie?  Uh, Uwe Boll.  I don't know.  But he had some 9-11 stuff that people hated.  So, uh, we could start.  Uwe Boll.  Uwe Boll.  Uwe Boll.  Yeah, Uwe Boll.  He's a weird guy.  We could get into some other material, but Kent call back.  Can we call him Trav?  Trav Dog?  Do we have his number?  Trav Dog.  Yeah.  Why don't we just give him a call and just tell him he might be listening now.  I just got his number, so.  Yeah.  Tell him we're just fucking giving him our time and relax and to call up and, uh. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  There's a picture of him with some guy in a hat.  Oh, wait.  No, that's not.  Uh, that's John Landau, producer of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.  Really?  Dick Tracy, Titanic, and Avatar.  Wow, all right.  Oh.  That's Landau.  That's the guy that, uh.  Yeah.  He produced those movies, yeah?  Yeah.  Oh.  Big Hollywood mogul.  He was actually asking for Franklin's, uh, DVD.  There's, uh. 
[03:19:00]  I was wondering if Franklin charged the money for it.  He's got him and a couple of his buddies there for the first time.  We got him.  Oh.  All right.  All right, cool.  Kent.  Yeah.  You all right?  I've been having a shitty week.  I just didn't expect that right off the bat.  What happened?  What happened?  Anything you could, uh.  What happened this week?  Yeah.  Elaborate on?  Yeah.  It doesn't really matter.  Well, we'd like to know.  We kind of know you.  We don't want to, uh, you know. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah.  What happened?  We didn't want to piss you off or anything.  What happened?  I just, girlfriend broke up with me.  Cheated on me.  You know how it goes.  Oh.  Why?  Did she see your Facebook photos?  Jesus.  She cheated on you with who?  Uh.  Some new guy.  He was a more boring version of myself.  So, all right.  Well, uh.  Chaz Bono?  I was going to say, she cheated on you with Roger Ebert.  Aw.  See, another movie guy.  Yeah, movie guy. 
[03:20:00]  We're just teasing you, Kent.  We're just giving you the business.  You know the show.  Uh, is she, did you remove her from your, uh, Facebook?  Yeah.  Pretty much.  Oh, you did?  All right.  Pretty much.  It's over then.  How long were you with this, uh, with this girl?  Oh, good question.  Uh, since last summer.  All right.  So, almost a year.  Wow.  And how long do you suspect that she's been cheating on you?  Uh, about two or three months.  How'd you find out?  Uh, she told me.  Oh, boy. 
[03:20:30]  What'd she say?  Like, how'd she break it to you?  Like, I need to talk to you?  Or, look, this is serious.  Could she take off the Mountain Dew case hat?  Kent, that's funny, man.  That's funny.  How awkward would that be?  She walks in with a serious news and has to tell you.  Yeah, and then he's wearing his Mountain Dew captain's hat, making the pew pew shooting  noises, and she's like, could you put the fake gun away and take off the Mountain Dew  case hat?  Playing with a Star Wars ad hat?  Yeah.  Could you put down the Ewok? 
[03:21:00]  I have to talk to you about something.  Yeah.  All right.  So, Kent, what happened?  How did she tell you?  Uh, she just showed up at my door completely unexpected, and, uh, then she made it seem like  it was, uh, my fault that she wasn't around.  It, it's...  All right, wait, hold on.  Now, what...  Wait, she showed up at your door.  Was she mad about your impending trip to Europe?  Uh...  With Ben?  I'm sorry, what?  Did she think you were going away on a trip to Europe with Ben? 
[03:21:30]  With...  All right, no, what happened?  Like, all right, so you met her at camp, and you kept calling her, and they said she  wasn't there.  Um, am I getting the reference?  Yeah.  I, I just, I thought maybe, um, all right, so Laura Dern broke up with you.  Um...  Oh.  Oh.  I'm teasing you.  I get it.  All right, yeah.  Rocky Dennis, okay.  All right, so what happened, buddy? 
[03:22:00]  For real?  Uh, she just showed up at my door crying and kind of made it seem like it was my fault.  She cheated on me and put me in the bad guy position over the whole thing.  How did she say it was your fault?  How did she blame you for being dishonest with you?  Uh, I, I suffered from migraines and back pain, and that for a while I wasn't as accessible  as she wanted me to be.  Um, and, uh, yeah, she, uh, she basically thought I was blowing her off, but in reality 
[03:22:30]  I wasn't getting out of bed for days at a time.  Okay.  I gotta ask you an honest question, Kent.  Yeah.  Do you spend too much time being a nerd, and she wanted you to maybe knock off on that  nerd shit a little bit, so you guys would hang out as a couple?  Dude, she's way nerdier than I am.  Okay, I'm not sure, I was wondering if you were going out with, you know, a fellow nerdy  type person, or...  No, yeah, no, I, I like nerd chicks.  How is she nerdy?  I'm sorry, what was that?  How is she nerdy?  Like, what does she do that's nerdy? 
[03:23:00]  Uh, she's into video games and anime and foreign films, and...  Okay.  Does she LARP?  I don't know, right there.  Lay another repulsive person?  Yeah, no.  Oh.  So, is that it, guys, or...  Well, I mean, are you gonna...  Kent, we're having fun with you.  Yeah, are you gonna find another nerd to go out with?  Yes.  Uh, probably.  How, how long, uh, how long ago did you break up, actually? 
[03:23:30]  Uh, like, two days ago, and I'm still...  Oh, I was just very fresh.  I haven't, I haven't been sleeping, and it's...  Oh.  Two days ago.  Well, Kent, we like you, you know, we're just fucking...  How old a guy are you?  Uh, 26.  That's way older than I thought.  Um, you're still a kid.  I know, I, I'm pitiful.  I can't even...  No, you're not pitiful.  No, no, no.  We're just breaking your balls.  You're still a kid, that's good.  Uh...  You haven't been able to sleep at all?  How about eat?  No, I haven't, I haven't gone to bed yet.  I've been listening to the whole show.  Like...  Really?  Like, seven in the morning here, yeah. 
[03:24:00]  All right, listen.  Man, that sucks.  The guy wants to be left off the hook.  So, you know, you took some abuse for about a half hour, but we really want to get an Iron  Man 2 review.  No, but legitimately, it was funny.  I didn't want to break it up by calling in and seeming like a douche who's like...  Yeah, I understand.  But let's get some real business out of the way.  So, uh, what do you think of Iron Man 2?  It's, it's good.  I can, I can, I can read.  Before it happened, I read, click, click, tile tone, click. 
[03:24:30]  People just, they see it coming.  It's so, it's so incredibly...  That whole segment was incredibly cruel.  Not really, I mean...  Not really!  We just teased the guy, we just, you know, come on, you gotta chip up a little bit.  Exactly.  He's probably sitting there laughing right now, understanding what the show's about.  Yeah, it looks like crying.  Yeah.  Look, sometimes you laugh till you cry.  You ever done that?  No.  No?  Yeah.  You laugh till you cry or cry till you laugh? 
[03:25:00]  Yeah, you could do either.  All right, quick break, we'll continue.  Wait!  Five minutes.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  My tickets go on sale.  Oh, my God!  For the Borgata, five minutes from now, theborgata.com for July 2nd, 3rd, Friday, Saturday.  So, if you want, by the time we get back, they will be on sale.  Wow.  Happy birthday, Tracy Lourdes.  Oh.  Tracy Lourdes, 41 years old today.  41 for Tracy Lourdes.  Wow.  Also, uh... 
[03:25:30]  Damn.  This is for the older people, Ant.  Robert Hedges, welcome back, Cotter.  Which one was he?  Epstein.  Juan Epstein.  Epstein.  Juan Epstein is 59 years old today.  Wow.  How old?  The Puerto Rican Jew.  The Puerto Rican Jew.  Very good.  Yes.  And, uh...  Steve Perry left Journey 12 years ago.  Yeah.  Wow.  Time does fly.  And we still got the oil slick. 
[03:26:00]  Are they going to tap that fucking thing today?  Yeah, they've been putting that little fucking house on it.  That little cement house with the pipe running up.  Mm-hmm.  By the way, remember that guy that we were laughing at?  And he was like...  Yeah, but he said a mile-long pipe.  Pipes or a...  He said pipes or a hose or something.  He did say a hose.  And he goes...  I'm sorry, that guy.  And then put it down there and just get...  And then they just did that.  I'm sorry.  We made so much fun of him.  Maybe that guy should call back for his apology.  Yeah, fuck it.  We don't apologize often, but you, sir, get an apology today. 
[03:26:30]  But when we do, it is dos ejes.  Hey, what happened with the Dow yesterday?  So, I'm on Twitter and all of a sudden...  It was Andy Levy.  He's like, his fault, Dow down 200, Dow down 300, Dow down 400.  He was in a panic on his Twitter.  It was about almost 1,000 points down because some idiot sold Procter & Gamble stock.  Okay.  And instead of selling, I believe it was 16 million shares, he put in to sell 16 billion shares, 
[03:27:00]  which started this chain reaction of automated sell-off, and people just started selling.  Then people saw that crashing and started selling, and it just made this one guy putting in the wrong fucking amount...  That's all it could take to fucking destroy everything?  A giant fucking crash.  Although they do have rules in place, so they took back all the trades, I hear.  You can't get away with that.  Yeah, but it didn't... 
[03:27:30]  You know what?  They took back all the trades, but it didn't come back.  The market didn't come back, and it's fucking...  I'm looking at some stocks.  I see a lot of red...  I see a lot of red down arrows today.  There's some buying opportunities because of this guy.  I know where the market's at.  I go to the market all the time.  What do you mean it didn't come back?  We took the market.  No way.  I go there and buy my lunch and dinner and stuff.  Here's one.  Die, Chip. 
[03:28:00]  Tell me how you really feel.  Yeah, so that's what happened.  I don't know how one fuck-up...  But how many zeros did he fuck up?  I can understand if you pop one zero on the end.  Apparently three.  That would be three, right?  About three zeros, I guess.  How do you fuck up by three zeros?  An extra one I could see, right?  Yeah, I don't know.  He put in the wrong fucking amount. 
[03:28:30]  Millions and billions.  Ooh, that's a big difference.  That really is a big difference.  He had a billion instead of a million.  You hear about the kids with the American flag shirts?  Oh, my God.  That's fucking annoying.  And a little bit of a jam up there?  Yeah.  I would hate to go to school in this day and age.  The rules they got in place for these fucking...  It's schools.  Are you an injury?  I still do.  I drive...  I drive around the park.  Yeah, I cruise the parking lots.  Well, sometimes I...  We knew it was sinking a mile, but we just didn't show our flag, you know? 
[03:29:00]  We didn't mean anything by it.  We weren't trying to start anything.  Nothing like that.  The boys said the school's assistant principal, Miguel Rodriguez, and principal Nick Bowden told  them they couldn't wear the shirts.  We said that we had to turn our T-shirts inside out.  Ugh!  Why?  We could go back to class, but we said no because we thought it would be disrespectful to the  flag if we were hiding it.  Wear it on any other day, it's fine.  But just because it's today, you can't wear it.  His exact rules.  Did he give a reason why he felt that he shouldn't wear it? 
[03:29:30]  Because it was supposed to be a Mexican day, so we were supposed to honor them.  This fucking despicable school in California on Cinco de Mayo made these American kids  in an American, four of them take off their shirts with the American flag or bandanas  with the American flag.  What a fucking, gee, I wonder why people resent rampant immigration like that.  Gee, I wonder why.  Yeah.  What a bunch of fucking cunts politically correct people are.  Yeah.  You really are, you're cunts.  School's getting a lot of shit, though. 
[03:30:00]  That doesn't hurt anything to do.  And so is the one that allowed the black students to take the fucking trip without the white students.  What a bunch of cunts.  Which one was that?  Oh, Ann Arbor, Michigan.  It's a huge one.  You didn't hear about that one?  Yeah.  Whites were excluded.  It was a black...  Depending on where the trip was going, I might agree.  A black's only field trip.  Yeah?  Where were they going?  How's that going to help us all get along?  Black's only field trip.  How is that going to help us all get along?  I am getting together a whites only field trip.  I am absolutely getting together.  You have one.  They're called your parties. 
[03:30:30]  Oh, fuck, you're right.  Okay.  That's what I meant.  I'm having a party.  Whites only.  You have a black only fucking field trip.  Holy shit.  Blacks only.  Here's the second part of the flag story.  The boys say it was unfair as some students were wearing Mexican colors, and they showed  us pictures of the Mexican dancers who performed on campus today.  We're not mad that they wore their stuff, but we were just mad that we were asked to change  our stuff, but they could still wear their stuff.  I would have took my stuff off if they had to take their stuff off, too. 
[03:31:00]  Four of the five students who wore American flags or patriotic colors on campus walked  into a meeting with the superintendent of the Morgan Hill Unified School District tonight.  They were facing unexcused absences because they chose to go home early rather than take  off what they were wearing.  What a fucking despicable fucking school system.  Why not just leave them alone and not make a fucking ... Don't they realize they're making  the big deal that if a few kids in school were even pissed that ... A few Mexican kids 
[03:31:30]  were pissed that they were wearing American flags, it would have been done with.  But they made a big deal of it, and now it's a news story, and it's ... They're stupid.  How about fuck any Mexican kids that are offended by an American flag?  Exactly.  Look at where you are.  This is America.  They're dying to come here, right?  People want to come here so badly, and we're supposed to be so tolerant of immigration.  And sure, you can celebrate Cinco de Mayo.  I have no problem with that.  But to resent somebody for wearing an American flag, how about you stop honoring the fucking  Mexican flag because you can't get out of Mexico and Puerto Rico fast enough? 
[03:32:00]  Yeah.  And how about you begin riding around with the fucking American flag on your car?  How about that?  And don't get pissed off if someone wants to wear an American flag on Cinco de Mayo.  God, is that fucking enraging.  It's ridiculous.  Enough with your own fucking ... Your home country culture.  Stop coming here then.  If you really don't want American culture, if you want to celebrate your own culture back  home so bad, fine.  Go there.  Look, I'm Irish by fucking nationality.  I don't give a fuck about Irish culture. 
[03:32:30]  I don't care.  It means nothing to me.  Wow.  It means nothing to me.  Yeah.  Fuck, is that annoying me?  Yeah.  That's why I trash liberals so much.  It isn't because you're pro-gay marriage, because I agree with you.  It isn't because of most of your ideology.  It is because of stuff like this.  It makes me fucking crazy.  Why would they even acknowledge it?  Why would they just let ... All right, these kids want to show their American pride with  American flags on Cinco de Mayo. 
[03:33:00]  Leave them alone.  Let them fucking do it.  What a disgusting school system.  Disgusting.  Horrible.  Speaking of which.  There were a few political correct, or at least a couple of those stories today.  Wow.  Well, the black field trip.  We got more info on that.  Oh, yeah, the black field trip.  Yeah.  And then I think there is another one we could get to.  Yes.  Let's see how to Drew in Michigan.  Drew, what do you got on the blacks-only field trip?  Yeah.  They went to go see a rocket scientist, I believe he was, and he was a black guy.  And so the school board ... 
[03:33:30]  Come on.  Yeah, and the school board thought it would be fair to have only the black students because  of the inequality in the school system towards black students, because for some reason they're  saying that they're not able to learn as well, and so they wanted to divide it up to  make it more fair for them.  And now everybody's pissed off because a lot of the white parents are saying their kids  would like to go see this guy, too.  Maybe the white parents are just fed up with the double standard and the fucking belly aching. 
[03:34:00]  Place on ground, light fuse, get away.  That's science, motherfucker.  Ugh.  That's unbelievable.  Stop with your fucking, your fake racism, your fake fucking pissed off at racism bullshit.  Oh, I'm so sick of it.  It's such a double standard, it's ridiculous.  And it's so blatant now.  It's not even, it's not even being disguised as like, well, it's a double standard, but 
[03:34:30]  it's because of this.  And now it's just blatant.  Blacks are pretty much doing anything they want to the detriment of especially white males.  And I don't mind, let me again paint this, I don't feel like white people are victims.  I really don't.  I do.  I don't.  I absolutely do.  I think we have it great in this country.  We do.  My only issue is this.  We're being victimized.  I don't mind a blacks-only field trip.  As long as there was no penalty for other people doing it. 
[03:35:00]  Like, if all of a sudden they said, look, we think this would benefit white students,  we're going to do like a whites-only thing here.  And you had them, if everybody was equally comfortable doing that, I would have no issue with it.  That's my only problem.  You know why?  There'll always be an issue because blacks will always claim that they're constantly playing catch-up.  And because they had so many years of oppression and blah-de-blah-de-blah,  they've got to have their own field trips, their own clubs, their own everything,  that if you did it with only white people, it would be a fucking Klan meeting that would be protested and be insane. 
[03:35:30]  Crazy people.  Wow, whites want to get together and celebrate the fact that white people did this or that or, you know, certain white cultures.  Just anything.  You cannot be proud of it.  You can't celebrate it without coming off as a white supremacist, a militia, a fucking this, that.  It's ridiculous.  I'm so sick of it that I don't put up with it anymore. 
[03:36:00]  I agree.  I don't kowtow to it, I don't listen to it, and I don't fucking buy any black person's argument that they're doing it  because they have to catch up for time missed out on.  Go to fucking school, read the same shit, don't say that tests are biased,  don't get into the fire or police department with radically lower test scores  because there's some fucking problem with the test.  Fuck you.  Take the same test.  You pass it, you're in, you don't, you're out.  But see, the issue to me here is not even the black students wanting to do that. 
[03:36:30]  It really isn't.  It's the penalty the other way.  That's my problem.  I got a problem with both.  With both.  If they want to do something with Spanish students only, as long as both,  you know, there's a whole separate but equal argument, which is not valid.  I think in Brown versus Board of Education, they said, well, separate but equal doesn't count.  You can't have it both ways.  It's either right or it's wrong.  And the problem is we get penalized for stuff that other people aren't.  And that is still, by allowing that, whites allow that, that is fucking saying that blacks 
[03:37:00]  are underclass and second-class citizens.  And it's still the parents treating another race like children.  That really is what it is.  It's fucking paternalism.  It's sickening.  It really is, yeah.  It is this paternalistic fucking attitude.  With the American flag, there's not even black and white.  It's just a bunch of self-flagellating, guilty white people who feel smarter.  They feel better than, and they are terrified that if they say anything, their inner feelings  are going to be revealed.  Take that flag off.  This is the Mexicans' day. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  Just take it off because, you know, we know we're better and everything.  Yeah.  So just take it off.  Let them have their day.  Let the little you-know-whats have their day.  Yeah, yeah.  Have their day.  That fucking principle, what a disgrace.  That fucking cocksucker.  It really is disgusting.  What a disgrace.  Hey, going with what Ant was just saying, it leads us to what Reverend Al Sharpton is  saying today.  Oh, fuck a duck.  Did you hear this yet?  This asshole.  Did you hear this yet?  No.  No, I haven't even heard it, but I know it's going to be.  He's jumping on the Mexican bandwagon, too, because the black ship is pretty much leaving 
[03:38:00]  with Obama being president and a lot of blacks in power in the country and getting this preferential  treatment.  But Reverend Al really doesn't have much to say anymore unless a cop shoots a black perpetrator  and, you know, a white cop shoots a black perp and all of a sudden he's a fucking scumbag  and in trouble.  And the other guy was getting his life.  He was just getting his life together, man. 
[03:38:30]  He was just getting his life together.  He had five children from four mothers.  He was going to school.  Yeah, he just got busted for weed and fucking coke and crack, but he was getting this together.  That's every episode of 48 Hours, the first 48.  Every episode.  And the cops are like, you know, just because he was involved in some, you know, odd dealings  doesn't mean we should not pursue his killer like we would anyone else's.  And I'm just looking at the cops going, stop for the camera. 
[03:39:00]  Stop it.  You don't have to search out those shows, though.  Me?  Yeah, your blood pressure would be a lot better.  I put him on my blood pressure is great.  I sleep like a baby.  You know why?  Because I'm not, I'm not wound up, I get wound up talking on the air about it, but in real  life, walking around, I am skippity-doo-dying over my race.  The honesty that I'm able to live with.  But why do you watch those shows?  It's fascinating.  Why?  To reinforce certain beliefs that I have. 
[03:39:30]  Certain beliefs that I have.  That, believe it or not, I am very honest on this program, but if I voiced some of those  beliefs that I have, it would cause grave problems for me.  But there are certain beliefs that I have that I honestly believe, myself, whatever, that  they are true.  And certain programming that I watch reinforces certain ideologies.  How many times a night do you go, yep, thought so? 
[03:40:00]  Many times a night.  I go, and I can watch Cops, and I know when it's a domestic that it's going to be a white  trash mullet guy.  Like, I know that, but there are certain crimes that are inherent to certain races more than  others.  It is just the fucking way it is.  Why, when I watch First 48, that spontaneous shooting homicides are, the majority of them  are black-on-black crimes. 
[03:40:30]  Spontaneous shooting.  Now, I'm not saying, there are plenty of murders.  I watch Cold Case Files.  I watch a lot of other shows.  And I, believe me, I do look at FBI statistics sites.  I look at crime stats.  A lot of white people commit premeditated crimes, crimes of passion, crimes for insurance money.  They'll kill their children for the sick fucking diseases that they have.  Understandably.  But this First 48, every time you turn this show on, it is black-on-black, spontaneous 
[03:41:00]  shooting crimes.  They were hanging out.  There was a drug deal.  They were hanging out drinking beers.  They were hanging out doing this.  One guy gets disrespected.  Boom!  Shoots another motherfucker.  Believe me, I don't want to play the House liberal, but I think it's economic.  Because...  Economic?  Here's why.  Here's why.  No, I am not buying the economic angle.  Because I guarantee you that the First 48, or any show like that, isn't shooting people 
[03:41:30]  who are middle-class economically.  Like, if you get a bunch of, a black neighborhood with a bunch of middle-class families, and there's  really not a drug problem, or drug dealers, that stat is probably, it's probably remarkably  lower.  It's probably not even different than most, any other stats.  And again, I'm not saying people don't have choices, but that one, when you see, when  it's all drug dealers and people drinking outdoors, I understand, I understand. 
[03:42:00]  But look, there are a fuck of a lot of poor white people in this country, too.  Yes.  And then why, when I watch First 48, aren't there a lot of white trash on white trash shootings  and murders, these spontaneous, drug-related, gang-related crimes?  It is, I swear to you, 99% of that programming is black-on-black, spontaneous shootings.  Can I answer why I don't think that it's, you know, mostly white?  Because the type of atmosphere that stuff happens in, which is like an outdoor, a bunch 
[03:42:30]  of people milling about with pistols, you just don't have, like, drug, hold on, you  don't have, drug, white people deal drugs differently.  You go to a guy's meth lab.  So then that has nothing to do with your saying economics.  It's this mentality.  It's this respect me or die mentality.  Hold on, meaning that you don't see white neighborhoods of any kind where people are  congregating outdoors like that and there's the air of violence where you don't pull up  and see 30 white drug dealers. 
[03:43:00]  Again, usually.  Why?  That is economics, then.  I don't think it's tolerated as much, to be honest with you.  I don't think it's acceptable in a white neighborhood.  Then isn't acceptance and tolerance, doesn't that have nothing to do with economics?  It has to do with a mindset.  It has to do with a culture, a mindset, an upbringing or lack thereof, discipline, this  whole fucking hallucination of respect between each other where there is none. 
[03:43:30]  There isn't a respect for human fucking life in the slightest in that drug culture.  I'm not saying race or culture has nothing to do with anything that goes on in a black  neighborhood or an Italian.  I'm saying race has something to do with it.  And I'm not saying that it has nothing to do with...  There's a racial proclivity that is there that I see.  I say it's much more economic because you don't see it happening in middle class or  upper class financial neighborhoods.  It just doesn't.  You don't see it with black middle class or upper class either.  That's what I mean. 
[03:44:00]  But I'm saying lower class whites and lower class blacks, they treat each other differently.  There is this element of violence in the black community that is not as inherent in the white  lower class community amongst each other.  That's why there's so much more of this drug-related, gang-related, respect-related shooting.  Do you have those?  Spontaneous shooting.  But are there white projects like, say, like Cabrini Greens, where you have... 
[03:44:30]  Well, there's trailer parks and stuff.  No, no, but I mean housing projects where you have...  Meth lamp.  ...say 10, 15-story buildings...  Yeah.  ...with that many broke people living in them and that many people out...  It's almost like when you cram that many fucking poor people into a small area, you're going  to have fucking problems.  I don't know if it...  I'm not saying there are no white projects, but I can't think of a lot of them.  I...  From what I've seen... 
[03:45:00]  Look at the mafia.  Look at the mafia.  Yeah.  There's not as many knee-jerk things.  Mm-hmm.  But look at the murderous...  The acceptance of murder in that culture.  And these are guys who make a lot of money.  And these are guys...  Even that was business.  It's...  I'm not talking about this spontaneous murdering of someone you were just having a beer with.  I've seen these murders.  It's somebody that's hanging out and then decides, I'm going to rob the...  I was just hanging out with them, doing some drugs, drinking some beer. 
[03:45:30]  You know what?  I could use a few bucks.  I'm going to shoot them in the fucking head and just leave.  And a lot of people would say that's less cold-hearted than guys that have known each  other for 30 years, being able to murder each other over fucking 10 grand or over the  orders of somebody else.  One guy could be your best friend and the boss says he's got to go and you set your friend  up.  Like a lot of people would say, that's a vulture mentality.  Well, okay.  Then if I agree with you, then you would have to agree that it is culture-based because the 
[03:46:00]  mafia and that whole thing is a culture that came from Sicily, came over here, remained  relatively the same for many years until law enforcement broke it up.  But the truth of the matter is, that was a culture-based violence.  No, I won't agree because what I'm saying is, it's fucking, it's not based, it's not like  black people are the only ones behaving like that.  Like, it's not like black people are the only ones where you could go, wow, in that neighborhood. 
[03:46:30]  I'd never say only, Jimmy.  I would never say only.  Or, okay.  I'm saying a majority, not even majority, I'm saying a disproportionate amount.  There's a disproportionate amount of black-on-black violent crime that's very spontaneous, that's  very violent, that doesn't have much reason behind it, as opposed to lower-class white people.  I don't see a lot of the white-on-white crime based on spontaneous drug dealings and stuff.  Yeah, you get your biker gangs fucking killing each other over a meth lab or something like 
[03:47:00]  that, but it in no way relates to someone stepped on this guy's foot, someone yelled  something out a window, and they're found fucking, you know.  But in the mob, you are killed for stuff like that.  You are killed for disrespect.  You would have had to have gone, and if someone disrespected you, you had to go through the  fucking channels.  Sure.  And a lot of times, if it was just a disrespect of somebody calling you a fucking, you know,  you fuck with a made man, and you're killed for it.  Well, those are the rules that are set in place.  What, are there rules in the black community that if someone steps on your foot, you could 
[03:47:30]  shoot them in the fucking head?  No, no, no, not in the black community, but, like, in certain neighborhoods, maybe there  are fucking unwritten rules of respect.  If you do a certain thing, we are going to have a violent confrontation.  Just like in the mob, and I'm not saying, believe me, I think the mob is a much better  organized, less fucking violent.  I'm only saying that that type of fucking indifference isn't specific to one group, and you don't  have white housing projects that are like that.  I'm not saying that they don't exist, but I can't think, if you had it with that level 
[03:48:00]  of drug dealing and fucking drinking, I think you would have an equal number of fucking problems,  or close to it.  I wonder about that.  It's hypothetical, because I don't know, like you said, a white project, I don't know,  because lower class, lower income housing project are predominantly black.  So I don't know what it would be the other way around.  I don't know why that would foster so much violence instead of a feeling of community 
[03:48:30]  and relating to each other and wanting to maybe build it up and make it better instead  of shooting each other, dealing drugs, kicking in grandma's door.  For the same reason the mafia or that type of life doesn't foster a feeling of community.  I'm not feeling the analogy you're making between the mafia and this situation.  The mafia prays on its own.  They charge fucking quote-unquote protection money to small businesses, meaning it's not, 
[03:49:00]  that doesn't foster a feeling of community.  The Russian mob, another example, doesn't foster a feeling of community.  The Asian gangs, which I think we don't hear as much about.  There is absolutely a feeling of community in the mafia.  In the mafia, there is a feeling of community.  There is a feeling of family.  I mean, come on, familia.  That's fucking a feeling of family.  And the Crips and Bloods would say the same thing.  They would say the same thing about their relationships with each other, 
[03:49:30]  but not with the rest of the community.  The same way the mob has relationships with each other,  but the rest of the community they pray on.  And the Russian mob prays on their community,  and the Asian gangs pray on their community.  But it goes outside of gang borders also.  Asian gangs are the worst.  Oh, I know that, but it goes outside of gang borders too,  because a lot of the crime you see isn't necessarily gang-related.  It's just, you know, it's drug-related, but it's more independent.  Like I said, spontaneous murders and whatnot. 
[03:50:00]  It just seems to me to be such a disproportionate number.  There should be more white people killing other white people.  How many of those, in that environment, how many of those murders are fueled by alcohol or drugs?  That's a big question, because I would say most of them are probably fueled by being drunk or high,  or a lot of them are, not all of them.  I'm wondering.  A lot of them are.  A lot more probably than in other situations.  I would just say there's a lot of other facts. 
[03:50:30]  And again, I'm not saying that fucking black people should be left off the hook.  I'm only saying that stuff like that I kind of look at as more economic.  Like if most of the people who are involved in that were middle class,  if you saw that in middle class neighborhoods, like black-on-black violence,  as much in middle class neighborhoods, I would say you're absolutely right.  I would completely agree with you.  I'll more so argue the cause, why it's like that, than the fact that it is like that.  I see it.  I see what it's like.  You could debate with me, and I might accept certain causes. 
[03:51:00]  You know, again, I don't want to hear the so many years of oppression and stuff.  Whether that's the cause or not, who the fuck am I to say?  So there could be a lot of causes.  Because regardless of the cause, I see the effect, and the effect is what I see and what I believe.  And that's where I stand.  Which is that it does happen more in black neighborhoods.  And I agree with that.  No one's saying it doesn't happen more.  But I'm saying that the cause is economic.  So I was never saying that it doesn't happen more in black neighborhoods.  Because it does.  That type of spontaneous, boom, boom, shoot, you're dead. 
[03:51:30]  You drive by, shoot, that's black neighborhoods.  But again, I think it's much more economic.  Oh, fuck.  Let's get out of here and go to our multi-million dollar houses.  Please.  Jesus.  Hold on.  As we debate the poor.  Hold on.  You and Ope can say that.  I don't have a multi-million dollar house.  Boo for Jim.  You live in a nice fucking neighborhood.  Your brother wants in.  Brother Joe.  Uh-oh.  What's up, Brother Joe?  Oh, geez.  Look at those phones.  Fuck.  Yeah.  I just had a thought that arguing against Jimmy, you know, his point that it's economic. 
[03:52:00]  Did you ever think about it this way?  You know, the shootings and murders that happen in depressed economic areas don't happen in middle-class areas simply because middle-class people don't do that.  They've worked their way – they've worked their way out of being – out of being ignorant.  I guess it's out of being ignorant. 
[03:52:30]  I mean, it's the other way around.  So are you saying –  People aren't shooting themselves because they don't have money.  No.  They don't have money because they're fucking shooting themselves.  No, Joe, I don't –  I don't –  I see his point.  I don't say that – hold on.  I'm not being excuse-giving enough to say that, ah, these poor folks can't help it.  They're just broke, so they kill each other.  I'm only saying that kind of an atmosphere when there's that many people in that type of a situation with drugs and alcohol, that many people doing it,  you're much more likely to have a lot of fucking fast murders than you are if people are in a fairly comfortable situation. 
[03:53:00]  So I'm saying that that's where it's economic as opposed to race.  Less to lose?  I think so.  Yeah.  I see what Joe's saying, though.  Yeah.  Not everybody that has a middle-class house and neighborhood came from a middle-class family.  Right, absolutely.  Some people work their way up, and that's why they're there.  They're not – and they're not committing violence.  It's because they didn't commit violence, and they got to where they are.  Yeah.  All right, Joe.  I'll see you.  I'll see you Sunday, man. 
[03:53:30]  Yeah, sounds good.  Mother's Day.  I think I'm going to get her pro flowers.  How many of mine are Steven Singer gold dibs?  What's the dipped rose or –  Vermont teddy bears are nice, man.  Vermont teddy bears are great.  Why don't you get one of those?  Is it Sunday?  Yes, it is.  And you'll be buying something for your wife.  Ah!  It's her first Mother's Day.  Snap, yo!  Absolutely.  You better.  You have to.  I don't know if I'm going to have the babies.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  The kid's pretty much – if you yell their chin, the kid can hear you. 
[03:54:00]  Hey, if the kid is born after Mother's Day, you know, what am I going to do?  Are you going to –  I'm going to save a few bucks.  I'm going to save a few bucks.  I don't see nothing.  Look, man.  Sunday is Mother's Day.  Sunday is Mother's Day.  This baby pops Monday.  What can I tell you, man?  I'm sure most of the people on the line do not agree with me.  Well, it's a mix.  No, no, it's a mix.  It's a mix, yeah.  It's got to be said it's a mix.  Yeah.  You want the Reverend Al Sharpton? 
[03:54:30]  Yeah, let's hear that.  I was just joking.  The struggle is not over until we achieve the clock.  Someone was saying to me the other day, Reverend Sharpton, we've got an African-American president.  We've achieved the dream of Dr. King.  And I told him that was not Dr. King's dream.  It's a great man.  I've been working with the president and supporting the president.  But the dream was not to put one black family in the White House.  The dream was to make everything equal in everybody's house. 
[03:55:00]  President Obama being in the White House can help us get there.  Well, we're not there yet.  I actually agree with Sharpton.  We're not there yet.  That's not inflammatory.  I actually agree with that.  Do you?  As far as what he's saying about Martin Luther King, yeah.  I mean, I don't think the – but what I don't like about Sharpton, and he's not saying it's not just president.  There's been a black secretary of state and a black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and this black Supreme Court justice. 
[03:55:30]  He's not acknowledged a whole shitload of other things.  George Bush appoints a black secretary of state.  Yes.  I mean –  And chairman of the Joint Chiefs.  Exactly.  But he's, you know, the antichrist that's still being blamed for everything.  Not that he doesn't deserve the blame for a lot of stuff.  But, I mean, you know, Obama being president isn't like this – they dropped a black guy from out of space and fucking put him in the White House.  This has been a progression of civil rights that has culminated in the president of the United States. 
[03:56:00]  So that's why I don't buy Reverend Al getting up there again crying that they ain't fucking there yet.  You're there!  Wow.  Christ almighty, you're fucking there.  Wow.  And watch TV.  You're everywhere.  You're in every fucking commercial.  It's astounding.  Unless it's a Sloman's Home Shield commercial, then you're nuts.  Then he's just the guy answering the phone at Sloman's.  Or fucking Broadview.  Broadview, I'm sorry.  Broadview security. 
[03:56:30]  Poor white girl is running from that dummy that fucking came to the party.  She would open the door.  You dummy.  You didn't even have to rape her.  She was hot for you.  Dunce.  Switching gears before we get out of here.  E-Rock, not in today, wasn't in yesterday, and he just sent me pictures of the aftermath.  Of the fucking Mayo Challenge.  It's his eyes.  Bad.  It's his fucking eyes.  I just put it on my Twitter, Opie Radio, one word.  Lifeless eyes, like a big fat man's eyes.  Like a whale's eyes. 
[03:57:00]  Oh, shit.  Look at him.  Look at those eyes.  He has busted capillaries in his eyes.  In the white shit.  Bloodshot red.  Bloody red.  That's not even bloodshot.  That's bloody fucking red.  You know, Mayo's kind of very viscous.  Yeah.  So it's kind of hard to push out.  Push it back out.  Yeah.  Well, he fucking blew out his eyes doing it.  So you can check out the pictures.  Wow.  He's fucked up.  Yeah.  That's pretty fucking brutal.  So.  Poor bastard.  Eric throws up really hard.  I think I remember his eyes did that thrown up from something else. 
[03:57:30]  He does throw up hard.  His whole head turns red.  Because we make him throw up hard.  Plus the fact that he puked three or four times on the show and then another three or four  after the show.  And by the way.  That boy loves his mayonnaise.  Yep.  Some guy on.  It's amazing how you can explain something.  Oh, Jesus.  And people just don't.  Don't listen.  There's a guy on Twitter.  EM Pulse.  He goes.  Jewish groups can't exclude students.  Christian skiers can't exclude non-skiers.  Who's acting like a victim? 
[03:58:00]  I said that white people are not victims.  I said that they're not.  I said that.  But certain groups can exclude people, but not public things like public schools.  Private places are allowed to exclude.  But do Jewish schools exclude people?  I don't know.  Public Jewish public schools?  I don't know.  I don't think they do.  I say that white people are victims when it comes to things like affirmative action and  police tests, fire department tests, civil servant tests. 
[03:58:30]  They're excluded.  They are being excluded from getting jobs where they have had better test scores than minorities.  Just to get minorities in there for this diversity.  And by the way, diversity only means people of ethnic minorities.  Diverse should mean everyone.  It never does.  So white people are victims when it comes to, hey, I got the better test score.  I was able to run through a physical or a mental test better for the fire department, police 
[03:59:00]  department, whatever.  And they are telling me I cannot get the job.  Someone with a worse test score is going to get it because he is of a different ethnic  minority.  I agree with you.  That's crazy.  It is sick, Nate.  And if the police department or fire department has to be predominantly white because of  that, then you know what?  Get your fucking ass in gear, study harder, work harder, and get the same or better test  score and you'll fucking be in. 
[03:59:30]  I agree with that.  Like, I'm saying white people as a whole, like as a group, we run things here and we're  doing very well.  I'm saying that you can't just go all of a sudden, oh, white society is a victim.  But yeah, on an individual level, it is sick.  How about this?  I was speaking to a police officer yesterday that had to qualify.  They got to qualify every so often with their pistol.  And he was in a lane at the range next to an African-American woman, police officer.  As he's shooting, he's lining up his shot and shooting and kind of, as he's shooting, 
[04:00:00]  he's hitting his mark and glancing over at the African-American woman shooting and she  is missing every fucking shot.  If it was the actual qualifier where you qualify for your gun, she wouldn't have been able  to carry a gun.  She was not doing as good a job as other people could have done in handling her firearm as  a police officer.  What the fuck is that about?  I'll tell you, it's fucking, it's, it's, first of all, the fact that you could see me at the 
[04:00:30]  Borgata July 2nd and 3rd has nothing to do with this.  The Borgata.com, motherfuckers.  But we're running out of, we're out of time.  But I do agree on that point too, Ant.  Hey man, have a good one.  Opie!  Good luck.  Yes, good luck.  We'll see what happens, you know, next week.  Daddy!  This could be the last show as, uh, on Daddy Opie.  Let's suck his cock. 
[04:01:00]  If someone would have, he wouldn't have been in this situation.  Whoa!  Ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba!  Whoa!  I'm gonna, I'm gonna bring all my fatherly, uh, views to the show starting next week.  Yay!  Yay!  The show changes starting next week.  Morning Zoo show!  If that happens, kill me.  Just, just fucking kill me.  Don't change the fucking floor.  Maybe a, maybe a, a, a little something here, a little something there.  But that's about it.  That's about it.  Not all in with that crap.  Yeah.  Have a great weekend, guys. 
[04:01:30]  Hope.  See you soon.  We'd like to point out that the actors involved do not always exhibit the communication, sensitivity,  or intimacy that are essential for sustaining real-life interpersonal relationships.  It's the Opie and Opie show.  We're retarded, uh, you know, broken down people, but we, the audience is just the, the fucking  drooling mongoloids that have chained to the wall that can't even raise their hand up.  So we're like a little better than them, and they're gonna fucking listen.  The ending, the ending, the ending, the ending. </pre>
