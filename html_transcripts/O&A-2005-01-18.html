<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Jimmy Norton's humorous mispronunciation, sparking playful banter between the hosts.  The introduction referenced their previous "Sex for Sam" controversy and their triumphant return to radio.  A caller, Julian, introduced a recurring character with a heavily affected speech impediment, whose authenticity was debated by the hosts. Other callers contributed jokes and complaints about the cold weather. Anthony detailed a frustrating morning involving his girlfriendâ€™s family, car trouble, and a gas station mishap, leading to a discussion of his dislike for children. Opie's late arrival was attributed to his Solitaire addiction.  The hosts discussed their upcoming appearance on "Celebrity Fit Club" and a plug from Fox & Friends (which inaccurately claimed they loved Mancow),  the CringeHumor.net awards nomination for Club Soda Kenny, a new song about producer Ben, and their interns.  Audio clips of fighting news anchors and a segment of "Trading Spouses" were briefly played throughout.

The show then heavily featured audio of a contentious on-air argument between news anchors Steve Bartlestein and Bill Evans, sparked by Bartlestein's mispronunciation of Melania Trump's name.  Sandra Bookman attempted to mediate.  The hosts played another clip of a pre-broadcast argument between news anchors at a different station, filled with insults and accusations about drinking. The hosts commented on the seriousness of news personalities versus their own approach, and discussed a Las Vegas weatherman fired for a racial slur and Steve Bartlestein's sexual harassment lawsuit.  Other topics included *Surreal Life*, new intern Charlie Garner, and a bizarre chocolate-covered banana advertisement.  A caller, Cal, offered additional information about the second news anchor clip.  A song parody concluded this segment.

A caller's garbled request to find people named Phil Thiju and Barbara Weyer led to a discussion of a plane crash.  The hosts jokingly requested a call from "Pat from Munaki," describing him as a large, aggressive pizza-lover.  They then called the "Two Bar" in Jersey City, attempting to locate individuals with absurd names, resulting in an angry, expletive-filled exchange. A comedic song about menstruation and its impact on men's social lives followed.  The hosts discussed their appearance on Donnie Deutsch's CNBC show, recounting their studio tour, lack of John McEnroe's set, and an encounter with a transgender person, with graphic descriptions of their physique.  They described Chevy Chase as miserable and combative during his interview.  The hosts discussed upcoming broadcasts from Washington D.C. and New Orleans for Mardi Gras, recounting chaotic past experiences in New Orleans, including interactions with Tom (a contact who provided alcohol and drugs), drunk engineers, a station owner licking a host's head, and a woman offering free BJs on air.  A phone call to Tom in New Orleans to discuss arrangements for the upcoming broadcast included anecdotes about his wife's weight gain.

The show continued with callers describing their experiences in New Orleans, including heavy drinking and a violent incident.  A New Jersey nurse couldn't show her breasts to a trucker with a "WOW" sticker because of the cold, leading to discussion about "WOW" stickers on the show's website.  The hosts discussed bathroom accidents from their childhoods, including graphic details of defecation and urination.  Jim Norton discussed childhood encopresis and alluded to uncertain memories of potential abuse.  A call from comedian Richard Jeni followed, clarifying previous on-air conflicts.  Frank Caliendo then called, providing impressions of George W. Bush and John Madden, interspersed with further discussion of Jeni, the conflict, childhood experiences, and creating new comedic material. A brief mention of a Brian from Fox & Friends plug was included.

The final segment focused heavily on VH1's "Celebrity Fit Club," discussing the participants' extreme weights, particularly Wendy the Snapple Lady and Mia Tyler.  The hosts called the show a "freak show" and speculated on the reasons for their weight, including graphic descriptions of Ralphie May's underwater appearance.  Audio clips of Wendy's hypnosis sessions were played.  Stella Diaz, a rejected Sports Illustrated swimsuit model search contestant, called in, leading to a crude and uncomfortable conversation with the hosts and Jim Norton, focusing on her appearance and speculation about her elimination.  The segment concluded with radio advertisements.

[00:09:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:09:30]  Hey,  God.  Thank you.  sex stunt at St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Ah, that's funny.  All right, you got it.  Wow, very good.  Good morning, my little scrambled fetus and bacon sandwich.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  The first mispronunciation of the day goes to Jimmy Norton.  I've been up since yesterday at 5, so. 
[00:10:00]  Are you going to get all angry at us for pointing out your mistake?  Yeah, hey, don't embarrass me on the air.  Yeah, we lucked out.  We got some nice audio.  We're going to play in a few minutes here.  But dug out, Doug.  So what?  You're a little upset?  No, no, I'm actually very happy.  I'm getting a little tired of hearing that in every intro.  Even yesterday was a new intro, but I had to mention it.  I know.  You're absolutely right.  I just want that to go away.  It's never going to go away.  In our obituaries, it's going to mention that stupid thing. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, it's always going to be there.  We did the Donnie Deutsch show yesterday for CNBC.  I don't know when they're going to tape it.  Well, we taped it.  I don't know when they're going to air it.  What do you mean tape it, Opie?  We already taped it.  Jesus.  Beautiful.  Hey, real quick before I punch out.  Tomorrow, 7 to 10.  Are you going to get all angry?  You want to do my job?  Fine.  Oh, no, no.  Hey, hey.  I don't want to slide some things on a board.  I'm not the reader.  I'm not the reader.  I'll be the codependent ape in the middle.  Hey, hey, it's cold out.  All right, Doug. 
[00:11:00]  I love that audio, man.  Tomorrow, 7 to 10, Virginia Beach.  Sticker stop.  All right.  Oh, cool.  And it's whackbag.com, of course.  Thank you, bro.  All right, guys.  Yeah, we bitch and complain that we don't want to be known for the Sex for Sam thing,  but we start the show every morning.  Yeah.  Kind of bragging about it, to be honest.  Of course we brag now, because we got jobs again.  It's like, look what we did now.  We brag about it.  We got national coverage for that, and sure.  Of course we did.  We're going to play all the clips.  Wake up call for ONA sounds retarded. 
[00:11:30]  What?  Might as well just kind of see what's going on.  Julian.  Hi, I'm being Anthony.  What's up, Julian?  I'm doing good.  I used to hear you on WNEW when you used to be on that station.  Oh, I get it.  Wake up call for ONA.  I thought he was going to say the wake up call for ONA sounds retarded.  Is this the wake up call for ONA?  The wake up call for ONA, and then in parentheses,  about the caller they wrote sounds retarded. 
[00:12:00]  Very good.  All right, all right.  Yeah?  All right.  Can I do my wake up call now?  Yeah, go ahead.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  Yo.  Yo, girls.  Wake up.  What the fuck are you doing?  Yo.  Yo, wake up.  Get ready.  Do all your wacky stuff.  But be sure you listen to ONA because they're coming down for you. 
[00:12:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be a character you were here on the show for years  and years to come.  Yeah, we got a new character.  We cannot let this guy go.  And this is his very first appearance.  We love new characters.  I love a new character.  Out with the old, in with the new.  Please tell me this is real.  Please tell me there was an umbilical cord wrapped around the neck for a couple of minutes.  So long, lady die.  Hello, Julian the retard.  Wow.  Now, Julian, what's wrong with you?  You got the, I think you got the palsy, right? 
[00:13:00]  No, I got your virus.  Wow, very good.  What's wrong with you?  He's got the palsy, I think.  Everybody.  Hold on.  I like it.  Get stupid.  Come on.  Get retarded.  Julian's theme song.  Get retarded.  Let's get retarded in here.  Let's get retarded in here.  Let's get retarded.  Yeah.  Let's get retarded in here.  I like that.  I like his new theme song.  Definitely.  We like the theme song. 
[00:13:30]  The new character.  God, we had that theme song ready to go for Julian, huh?  Of course.  So, Julian, you're from Austin, Texas?  Not originally.  I mean, I'm from the Caribbean, and then I started listening to you when WNEW turned from rock to talk.  Right.  So, what do you do for a living?  Well, I listened to you on the XM satellite.  Yeah.  How'd you get that XM? 
[00:14:00]  I purchased it at a local store in the mall, and then...  That's what we're feeling at.  Believe it or not, when I tuned into XM, I got a free preview of your programming, so I decided to add it to my programming so I could listen to you every day.  But how could you do that all by yourself?  Yeah, because I guarantee you one of those... 
[00:14:30]  You got the disease where you herky-jerky a lot.  The Ben disease?  It's...  Benitis?  He either has palsy or he's completely effing with us.  Yeah.  No, no, I'm telling you the truth.  What's wrong?  Like, obviously there's a problem.  Norton's not buying it.  Yeah, Norton's not buying it.  And Norton's shaking his head like, no way is this real.  And we're feeling it out because people that do the fake things usually trip up.  You sound the way Ben should sound, considering his movements. 
[00:15:00]  I mean, look, I'm not...  Look, I know it makes them crazy and bizarre, but you gotta know, I have respected you more than I have respected you.  He's pretty good, though, if he is faking.  Believe me, I hope it's real.  He's like, ah, he's got that whole thing going where you can just feel his muscles tensing at every minute.  It's just every second another muscle is tightening up and pulling his arm one way.  I hope to God his parents cringe every time they hear his voice and realize he didn't die in the middle of the night. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, God.  Wow.  It's real, OMA.  You sound like the comedian that has palsy.  We had him on the show once.  What do you got?  I think he's from Washington or something like that.  What do you got, the CP?  Uh, yeah, I got the CP.  You got the CP, huh?  Yeah.  Are you in a wheelchair?  No, I walk.  You walk, but do you have the funny crutches?  No.  No, I walk perfectly normal. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah?  How old are you?  28.  28 from Austin, Texas.  And what do you do for a living?  Um.  Did he say that in?  You asked before, right?  He listens to us, but that's not really a living.  Yeah.  What do you do for work?  Um, basically, I'm in a training program, so I don't listen.  I just listen to a couple of first hour of your show, and then I listen to the replays when I get back.  Yeah.  What are you training to be, though?  Well, actually, well, actually, I'm just hanging up clothes, but I'm training to be a bro, but I want to get classes so that way I can be a broadcast journalist. 
[00:16:30]  Shut up, dude.  Come on.  Uh, all right.  All right.  Well, I'm not buying, I'm not totally buying it, but, you know, we'll string him along for a little while.  There's something here.  We'll get to the bottom of it.  All right.  Hold on, Julian, all right?  All right.  All right.  There goes Julian, possibly our brand-new character. 
[00:17:00]  Tim, the trucker from Oregon.  What's up, Tim?  Yeah.  Did you guys hear last night on CNN SI that the kicker from the Jets tried to hang himself last night?  You're lying, sir.  Well, there's a joke, right?  But what happened?  Well, he couldn't kick the chair out from underneath him.  Oh, that's the joke?  Yeah, that's the old Scott Norwood joke.  Just reworked.  Oh, rehashed.  I lived in Buffalo, sir.  I know that joke.  Well, actually, it was a Greg Norman thing with the Seahawks. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, very nice.  All right.  Thank you, Tim.  What an annoying buzz on his phone.  Yeah, that was really bad.  All right, so.  He's got a bee in his bonnet.  All right.  So, I got a call from Anthony around, I don't know.  I'm not your keeper, by the way.  I just like informing people if I'm going to be a little tardy to the show, and you're the  only number I have.  It was very, very nice, actually.  But is this the pictures of the plane?  Look at this.  How is this thing going to ever fly?  Oh, that's great. 
[00:18:00]  We'll get into that a little bit.  There's some unbelievable pictures in our papers here in New York of this Airbus.  It's what?  The largest plane ever, right?  Yeah.  Most passengers.  Yep.  It's crazy.  But anyway, I get a call from you around 5, 5, 10.  I don't even know that you're going to be late.  Yeah.  There's an angry phone call from a gas pump in Queens.  Oh.  And it's 12 degrees out.  It's not a morning to pump gas.  I have things set up the way I like things.  It's not a morning to leave the house here in New York. 
[00:18:30]  Oh.  This would have been a great day to call in sick.  You know, living my life the way I do, and have in the past, and where I've gotten  in life doing what I do, I've earned certain things, I believe.  I worked hard for living for many years, Opie, in the construction industry.  You're just scaring me, because we've never worked hard in radio.  No, no, no.  This is the dream job.  We haven't earned crap. 
[00:19:00]  No, no.  I just mean life in general.  That's why I didn't say in this career.  We just happen to have a really good chemistry that's, I don't know, and it's working, but  we haven't worked hard at this.  No, no.  Not at all.  I mean, in life in general, me, myself, I have worked, I had a real job, you know?  I was doing construction.  I was in this type of cold, frigid weather, where a house is nothing but two by fours,  and you've got to put in duct work, and it's freezing cold, and you don't want to be there, 
[00:19:30]  and you're humping stuff, and there's ice, and it stinks.  And I did that.  But you know something?  I mean, throughout life, I have been afforded certain things, and now I just don't have  to deal with certain things, one of which is pumping gas in the freezing cold.  I don't like doing it.  So what I do is I keep my car garaged, make sure it's full of gas, and then when I leave,  I don't even have to deal with the outside world. 
[00:20:00]  Only the little walk that I take to the studio.  That's the only time you're outside all day?  Pretty much.  Yeah, because, all right, so your car gets warmed up for you, right, while you're getting dressed?  Well, it's in the garage.  But do you have one of those automatic...  No.  The garage is, like, heated.  Oh, all right.  I got you.  So I get in, open the garage door, and like I said, I have certain things that I have  now that I never dreamt I would have, and that's one of them.  How do you get gas?  Like on the way home or something. 
[00:20:30]  It's not, you know, I don't need it balmy.  I don't have to drive to the Caribbean to fuel up.  But, you know, the sun on you is one thing.  But when it's 4 in the morning, 4.30 in the morning, and it's 5 degrees out, it's just cold.  Are we looking at a garage diva here?  Garage diva!  How warm do you keep your garage?  It's not, like, heated where there's a vent in there, but, like, the water heater and stuff  is in the garage and well-insulated.  So it's warm enough, you know.  It's, like, probably, it's probably, I don't know, almost 60 degrees in there, which is fine. 
[00:21:00]  You know, and then you turn your heat on.  Very nice.  I enjoy the warmth.  And, uh, well, let's just say I have some company over the house.  There seems to be a family emergency.  Uh, with my girlfriend, uh, my girlfriend's family, and, uh, her sister and husband are down  and staying at my place.  And, uh, they also have kids.  There's, uh, two boys and a little infant-type baby girl. 
[00:21:30]  Can I preface this?  Yes.  For the new listeners.  Yes.  Anthony absolutely hates kids.  I...  No ands, ifs, or buts about it.  Anthony cannot stand kids.  You know what the extent of kids is in my life that I enjoy?  If you see one being pushed in a carriage or something and you go,  Oh!  Go-goo-doo-doo-doo!  And then walk away.  I, I, I could appreciate...  Do you actually do the go-goo-goo-goo-goo-goo?  No, I think it.  Oh.  You know?  Because I don't think anyone actually... 
[00:22:00]  No, no one does that.  Okay.  It's, it's, it's...  Do you have a rattle in the back pocket where you just...  Oh, no.  ...when you see kids?  I, I try to make believe they're not there, is what I do.  That's it.  And, and, and they're staying over.  And, um, well, this morning, the, the, their vehicle was in my, my driveway behind my, uh,  my garage door.  So I could not get my...  Truck.  My truck out.  Uh, like, uh, you know, I get in, it's warm. 
[00:22:30]  So I had to take my, my girlfriend's vehicle, which is out in the driveway in, in the freezing  cold.  By the way, there's a trucker checking in from Minnesota.  Yeah.  Pretty much saying, stop bitching about 12 degrees in New York.  It's a negative 48 in Minnesota.  That's why I don't live in that frozen tundra.  Ugh.  Minnesota.  No.  12 is cold enough.  It's plenty cold.  After 12, 12, 48 below.  Does it matter?  Does it really matter?  So I get, I get, I get in the girlfriend's vehicle and I have no idea how anything works 
[00:23:00]  in it.  And it's pitch black and, and I can't even...  I can't figure anything out.  And I'm trying to drive now.  It's freezing cold in there before it heats up.  And I can't figure out the radio.  So like Gwen Stefani is just blasting and I can't change the, and I mean blasting.  And it's early in the morning.  And now I can't even, I can't shut it off.  I can't change the station because now I'm really late and I'm driving.  It's, I am freaking out. 
[00:23:30]  I can't adjust the mirrors.  I don't even know how to adjust the mirrors.  So I can't see anything behind me.  I'm driving, freezing cold, loud Gwen Stefani.  Now I'm on the expressway.  You honestly couldn't figure out where the volume controls are?  I couldn't figure out.  It's like, it's like the glass cockpit of a brand new fighter jet.  There's no knobs.  There's no nothing.  It's all touchscreen, glass screen thing.  Oh yeah.  This thing is like the future.  I'm surprised it doesn't fly. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, sorry.  Not loud enough.  It was blasting and I couldn't turn it down.  And there I am.  Hey, here I am driving down the expressway.  How do I turn this down?  How do I turn it down?  Oh my God.  I'm freezing.  Oh stop.  I can't take it.  I'm freezing cold.  One thing I did hear though. 
[00:24:30]  Low fuel.  Low fuel.  What?  What?  My mule?  What are you saying vehicle?  I don't understand you.  Low fuel.  Low fuel.  I wish I could listen to 1010 wins. 
[00:25:00]  So I know what's going on for the show.  But I gotta hear Gwen Stefani on 11.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  This is my drive in.  Oh, it's only quarter to five in the morning.  I like listening to loud dance music at a quarter to five in the morning.  Stop.  Please stop. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  And then now I have to stop for gas.  Which is my nightmare early in the morning when it's 12 degrees out.  So, so I, I pull into the gas station and of course, uh, it sounds minor, but when you  ever been so livid that anything new thrown into the situation will just freak you out.  Oh yeah, definitely.  I pull in and of course the gas cap's on the opposite side of my vehicle.  So now I got to get back in and I've already slid the credit card through. 
[00:26:00]  So now I got to, I can't just go to the other side.  I got to kind of U-turn around and, and, uh, I go to open up the gas cap and I have no idea how to open up the gas thing.  And I am now, and I'm just tick tock, tick tock time is ticking away.  This is show prep time.  I'm picturing everyone sitting here, Ben Herking at his computer.  Hope he's going through the papers.  Uh, Norton's still sleeping cause he's not in until.  She, she picks up the phone. 
[00:26:30]  Uh, where the fuck's the gas cap?  Release the thing.  Shit.  Oh, baby, I don't know.  I've never fueled it up.  Ah, I'll find it.  Damn it.  Click.  That was my call to her.  At about five this morning. 
[00:27:00]  And you know what really ticked me off?  There is no thing.  You just do it with your hand.  Are you serious?  You just pull the flap up with your hand.  But every new vehicle and mine has a little thing inside.  They went back to old school.  They went old school on me.  And it threw me for a loop.  So now I, I think the only saving grace is it was a self-serve pump with a little thing that keeps the, the gas flowing.  So you should jump back in the car, right?  So, no, I could just put my hands in my pocket while I called Opie. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, it's me.  I'm, I'm putting gas in my car in Queens.  Really?  You thought you'd announce that to me.  I was like, what?  Why are you yelling at me?  Yeah, I'm like, whatever, dude.  All right, we'll be here.  I'm nice and warm.  It's about 80 degrees in our office.  We'll try not to start the show without you.  Yeah.  And I'm just a livid idiot.  Oh, so I was just, and I got no sleep really last night because I got to bed very late. 
[00:28:00]  Kids around the house.  And there's, there's a toddler around there, which just has me like freaking out because  art, my house, I pretty much have, yeah, keep them away from the rotating saw blades that  I have because I, I, the image of a child in this place just never crossed my mind.  You were telling me in the office, three kids running around?  Yeah.  Two little ones and an infant that's just starting to walk?  Two boys that are, I guess, like six, seven, eight-ish around there.  This is your hell.  This is your hell on earth.  And a girl who's like, I guess, one maybe, just like, just starting to walk, running around 
[00:28:30]  my glass coffee table with sharp corners on it.  And then yesterday, I'm on the computer and, yeah, and, and the parents go, go, oh, come  here, come here.  The kid is holding a pair of scissors.  The little one-year-old girl has scissors that I just leave laying around to open up  like boxes and stuff because it's not childproof.  Here's the kid. 
[00:29:00]  No, scissors.  And where was Randy Quaid while all this was going on?  No.  Oh, you're saying it's like vacation?  Was he in the kitchen with his, uh, Dickie and his little moose cup having some egg  nug?  They do live upstate, though.  Took a long trip down here.  You want to put an end to that problem, you ought to hire a fat clown from Chicago to come  over and entertain.  Oh, my God.  And, and, and, yeah. 
[00:29:30]  So the girl runs around and just finds every single dangerous thing in my apartment, which  there are plenty of, you know?  There's two adults living there.  It's very hard to be.  You don't baby-proof things.  You know?  I got like bleach and brandy snifters laying on the floor for some reason, you know?  And I didn't even realize it, but there it is.  I didn't even know that was there until the baby goes to take a swing.  And the boys just like to, for some reason, boys, uh, at the drop of a hat, just want to 
[00:30:00]  run around and go, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  All right.  We get it.  We get it.  We get it.  No, no, no.  Let me do it another half hour.  Then you might start understanding it.  Maybe, but probably not.  maybe an hour, two hours. 
[00:30:30]  I just sit on my computer  and just...  Then the girl finds this thing  that's been stuck to my refrigerator  for five years, probably.  It's a little happy birthday cake.  I had no idea what it ever did.  Didn't think it did anything.  Just held postcards on there.  That's all it ever did for five years.  You know what it does when you press the button?  Happy birthday to you.  That's nice.  That's all it does.  That's nice. 
[00:31:00]  You know what happens when you press the button  10,000 times?  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Yeah!  Yeah!  I...  I've always made it clear  I don't want children.  You hate kids.  I never want children.  Don't you have stuff  that they can play with?  This is such a cool reminder. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, scissors.  Whatever they want to grab  from an open box or something.  I'm petrified  when they run around the house  because, like I said,  I don't care.  I have just...  For no reason at all,  I guess about three weeks ago,  I took a frayed wire  and just plugged it in the wall  and left the two ends  just hanging there  because I like it.  Apparently I'd forgotten about it.  You know,  kids come over and grab it.  I don't know what I have  in my house. 
[00:32:00]  It's just dangerous.  I know it's dangerous.  You're bringing back  your memory  because my sister  will drop her kid off  in my house  every once in a while  like,  hey,  I got a couple errands.  Do you mind watching JD?  I'm like,  yeah,  no problem,  you know?  And then after  me and the kid  stare at each other,  and I love the kid,  we stare at each other  for about 10 minutes  and all right,  what do you want to do?  And he's like,  you got anything  to play with here?  I'm like,  didn't mommy give you  some toys to play with  while she does her errands?  No. 
[00:32:30]  And we're sitting  on the couch  and I mean,  you can only have  a five-minute conversation  with a five,  six-year-old,  right?  I'm like,  well,  you like video games?  Yeah.  All right,  try this.  And this is an old story,  but I threw in  Grand Theft Auto for him.  Oh my God.  So then you fast forward  an hour  because now I'm doing  my thing  because it's kind of like,  you know,  you let the TV babysit  the kid,  I learned,  a long time ago.  Yes.  Whether you throw  a cartoon on  or Grand Theft Auto,  it works.  They're quiet,  they're sitting in front  of the TV  enjoying themselves  and you can go do 
[00:33:00]  whatever you have to do.  That's pretty much  what I wound up doing.  So you fast forward  a half hour,  40 minutes  and my sister comes  Greg,  what the fuck  are you doing?  And I'm like,  what?  I come running  in the living room  and there's JD.  He figures out  how to use the guns  and how to pick up  prostitutes.  Oh really?  Oh yeah.  He's playing the game?  Well,  because I figured,  I gave him the basics.  Like,  you know,  you jump in this car here  and you drive it around.  Drive around the city  a little bit.  It's cool,  right?  And I'm thinking  a five,  six year old,  he's never going  to get past that stage.  I come in  and he's just  blowing people away. 
[00:33:30]  He's picking up  the prostitutes.  He's figuring out  the whole game.  Oh man.  And I didn't know this  and my sister  just walks into my house  and that's what she sees  and she just starts  cursing me out.  I'm like,  what?  What are you doing?  Like,  next time maybe,  you know,  leave toys with him.  I don't know.  Yeah,  you just wind up  throwing videos in.  You know,  we have some videos  laying around  that they can watch.  You know,  here,  watch Full Metal Jacket,  kid.  What the hell? 
[00:34:00]  Well,  that's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  You know,  yeah,  you got videos,  but do you have  videos for kids?  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  And when you're desperate,  you'll be like,  ah,  that's all right.  How many,  how many complete  nude scenes  are even in this movie?  You know,  it's not hardcore stuff.  What the hell?  About time  the little fella  learned about trannies.  Yeah,  all right,  pop this in.  Thank you,  Yosh.  Yeah,  I love throat pudding, 
[00:34:30]  whatever it is.  Yeah,  throat yogurt.  I don't know.  I'm sure there's  a throat pudding also.  Yeah,  but it was terribly  directed.  A message to Yoshi,  we love you,  but enough with the porno.  That's for Opium.  Wow.  People love the porno.  I have a stack of porno  that he gave us.  I'm only through  the first one.  For Norton,  continue sending.  Of course.  And for Anthony.  All right.  Well,  that's...  Might have more kids  dropping by.  Well,  that's quite funny,  Anthony.  Oh,  it's just been,  you know,  one of those, 
[00:35:00]  I didn't get to sleep  last night.  I think about,  I think about  2.30 this morning,  I heard,  you know,  oh,  man.  Oh,  man.  From the,  from like the,  the room,  the guest room.  Dude,  I didn't,  am I hearing that?  I didn't get to sleep  because,  and actually,  I'm going to throw  myself under a bus  again today,  but,  Ben witnessed this  firsthand.  I discovered  Solitaire on my trio. 
[00:35:30]  You just got  a new top-of-the-line  computer.  Oh,  I know.  And you play Solitaire  on your trio.  That's the problem.  These simple games  are the ones that  are the problems.  Like the Grand Theft Auto  San Andreas,  I got it.  Yeah.  Love it.  But I discovered  Solitaire on my trio.  I didn't go to bed  until I beat the game  and it took hours.  You get obsessed  with these games.  I got OCD  when it comes to video games.  I can't put 
[00:36:00]  the game down.  I was in the middle  of the Jets game  this weekend.  Ben came over  with a few people  and I'm sitting  on the couch  playing game  after game  after game  on this trio.  And I get mesmerized  and I cannot  put the game down.  Yeah,  you're crazy.  And I get it  in my head.  I can't,  I can't stop  playing  until I beat  the game  and it's stupid  Solitaire.  You can't just  shut it off.  Can't shut it off.  Watch the football game.  So around 1130  last night,  I'm usually in bed  by nine. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  I finally beat  the game  and I can go to bed  for my five hours  because then,  you know,  you're up at four  or whatever.  And so it's  a horrendous obsession  I have with these  stupid simple games.  I need the full-blown  graphics.  Oh yeah,  I love that too  but for some reason  that's why I'm tired  today.  You're a lonely man.  That's the stupidest thing.  That's sad.  I'm not a trio with this.  No, I don't.  Do you use your little stylus?  Oh yeah, I do.  Beep.  Beep.  Over and over  and over again.  Like something just 
[00:37:00]  keeps clicking  in my brain  and I can't turn it off.  Do you chew on your stylus?  No, no,  I don't do any of that.  Big gnarly  chewed up stylus.  Why don't you just  get some real cards?  Oh, there you go.  No, that's  too much work.  Too much work.  It's more fun though.  You need a surface.  With the trio solitaire  you don't even have to  put the cards  on the aces.  They do it for you.  Does it all by itself?  The worst is when  you play solitaire  on the bed  and you kneel  and all the cards  kind of come in  towards your leg.  Are you into your knee? 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  You mess up  all the piles.  You actually play  the real solitaire?  It's the only way  a man does it.  Does anyone play  real solitaire anymore?  No, let's not.  You play chess  on the computer?  Yeah, I'd rather  play with a person  because the computer  is just, for me,  unbeatable.  Pretty rough.  You can go online  though and play  with other people online.  That's too creepy.  Yeah, that's creepy online.  If I'm on a computer,  would you come over  and take a leak on me?  Absolutely.  That's not creepy.  I stopped playing  chess online. 
[00:38:00]  I told this story too.  I got into chess again  and I started playing online  because I don't have  anyone around  to really play.  So I'm in kind of  a, I don't know,  I don't know.  Chef chatroom  kind of playing?  Yeah, but I'm trying  to think,  not like beginner,  kind of, I don't know.  Novice.  Intermediate.  Somewhere in the  chicken hog.  Kind of intermediate,  I guess, you know.  And I'm beating  these people left and right  and I'm like just,  I'm thinking I'm like  a chess champion again,  you know,  because I used to take  it a little, 
[00:38:30]  kind of serious  when I was a lot younger.  And then, you know,  that stupid chat feature.  Hey, you're pretty good  because I was playing  the same person over  and over again,  but in general winning  a lot of games.  And this guy goes,  hey, you're pretty good,  how old are you?  And I'm like,  well, how old are you?  Uh-oh.  I'm eight.  Eight?  I'm like, that's it,  I'm effing done.  Because it wasn't like  I was totally killing the kid.  I was, you know,  I was winning,  but, you know,  it took a little, 
[00:39:00]  some effort.  I'm like,  I'm playing eight-year-olds online.  I'll meet you.  Yeah, 7-11, my treat.  So now I can't admit  my real age  because it would be  way creepy,  so I'm like,  I'm 15.  If you're ever putting  I'm 15 into a computer,  oh, I know.  Turn yourself in.  So I was just,  it just got too creepy  and that was the end  of my online chess.  I'm like,  it's all little kids  just learning how to play.  Did you drive over his house  and give him a t-shirt?  Yeah, like Keith the Cop. 
[00:39:30]  Like Keith the Cop.  So I don't do that anymore.  Jim from the Poconos,  go ahead.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Anthony,  you got to do what I do.  When it's time for bed,  hey, Uncle Anthony  you got to go to bed.  Everybody go to bed.  I got to be the killjoy.  Time to go to bed.  And Opie,  you either need to get  a girlfriend or a hooker  because something's  going on with you.  All right, thanks, guys.  I have a question for Anthony.  Why didn't you,  like this morning,  why didn't you just  get these people out of bed 
[00:40:00]  and say,  get the keys  and say,  move your truck.  I got to go.  You know why?  It just would have  taken too long.  I know I was going  to be late.  I didn't want to be  ridiculously late.  And I can't,  you know,  I can't depend  that someone's going  to jump out of bed,  just grab whatever's  around,  and then get in the truck  and back it out  of the driveway.  Oh, I thought he was  just too busy,  empty in the septic tank.  No, it's not.  It's not a motor home.  Oh, all right.  I'm still convinced  Randy Quaid's  staying at your house. 
[00:40:30]  Are they going to be there  for a long time,  hopefully?  Stop it.  I mean, it's fantastic.  Yeah, I'm hoping,  because this was the easiest  40 minutes of radio  I've done in years.  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  Family, it's important.  Look, I'm fine  with them staying there.  I don't have a problem  with that.  Really?  Certain things  that I'm used to  and have become  accustomed to  in my life  without children.  You're really fine  with it, huh?  Yes.  Okay, I'm just wondering.  They may listen  to the replay later.  Yeah.  Ixnay. 
[00:41:00]  Of course, I'm fine with it.  It's too bad  we didn't have audio  rolling in the office  about 5 o'clock, 5.15.  I didn't say anything  except what I have said  on the air, my friend.  No, I don't.  I am very...  I'm just trying  to cause trouble.  Look, I'm set in my ways,  and it's, you know,  when I...  Cause I had my...  My garage door  was going up.  I was in my vehicle.  I started it up.  I put it in reverse.  Look in the rearview mirror,  and there's two headlights  staring at me, you know?  So it was kind of like... 
[00:41:30]  Now it's a big thing.  Cause I like just getting in,  and then you go.  Now the second I gotta  shut her down  and get out,  now there's a problem.  Now there's a problem.  And it started my day...  That started my day wrong.  Did you have the one moment  where you wanted to just  open their bedroom door  and scream,  get your effing vehicle  out of my way?  Hello?  Move it!  Chris from Memphis.  Maybe Joaquin Phoenix 
[00:42:00]  could have come over.  Move your car  in the driveway.  I have to go to work.  I'd appreciate it.  Get ahead, Chris.  Hey, how you guys doing today?  Good.  Hey, man.  How you doing back there,  meaty tits?  I'm really tired.  My hands are sticky  because I had muffin.  Okay.  I got a couple things. 
[00:42:30]  First of all,  I think we just come up  with a new promo,  Opie and Anthony's  babysitting service.  Yeah.  We give scissors  and booze to toddlers.  And Grand Theft Auto.  Grand Theft Auto.  All right, Chris.  That's it, bro.  Hey, did you guys happen  to catch that  Trading Spouses show  last night?  Oh, man.  I missed it  for like the first time  in a while.  Did we miss a good one?  It was a really good one.  It's going to be  continued next week,  but they had this one woman  who was a total neat freak  that you just wanted  to smack the shit out of her 
[00:43:00]  moving into a house  with this family  where they were just...  It was crazy.  Make sure you check it out  next week.  I like that show.  They usually get a poor person  to go in with a rich person's house  and vice versa.  It's pretty uncomfortable.  Go ahead, Chris.  Yeah.  Hey, Jim,  you're from New Brunswick, right?  I'm from North Brunswick.  North Brunswick.  Okay, were you in that area  last week?  Because I was back there  visiting family last week.  And this guy walks up to me  and he looks just like you, man.  Scared the hell out of me.  He walks right up to me,  looks him right in the eye  and he says...  Is that considered a got? 
[00:43:30]  Of course not.  No.  Because he didn't get me  to ask him anything.  He asked where I was.  I told no.  But I will say this...  I knew where it was going  before he got there.  Hey, Steve has the trading spouses  from last night?  Oh, we'll watch it.  Yeah, from last night.  All right.  There might be some good audio  on there, the guy's saying.  All right, I'll pick through it.  Speaking of good audio,  we're going to take a break.  We have Celebrity Fit Club.  I finally saw that show last night.  Isn't it great?  Oh, my God.  We got Wendy the Snapple Lady,  hopefully.  We got audio that's going  to just be killer. 
[00:44:00]  It's a great show.  And Anthony and I lucked out.  We kind of taped two anchors  on ABC News this morning  here in New York,  just kind of fighting on the air.  Having a little disagreement.  So then we got that.  We totally lucked out  because we were running tape.  And then one of our guys  came in with a real,  really good fight  of two anchors in L.A.  That's a good one.  I guess we'll play that next  when we get back.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  But first this.  You love your kids.  But sometimes  they can be a handful.  Kids are great  when they're other people.  Who can you trust  when it comes to your young'uns? 
[00:44:30]  You change them.  You wash them.  You bathe them.  Anthony's daycare oasis  is a paradise.  You're in prison.  You're in baby goddamn prison.  Filled with joy.  We don't think they're cute.  Tenderness.  We think they're annoying.  And most of all,  Anthony's love.  I can only hope  your child turns up  like little Adam Walsh  without his head.  Parents adore our staff.  These guys hate kids.  And our facilities are safe.  I have burning cauldrons  of wax  just sitting around  for aesthetics.  Just listen to these  happy children  frolic through 
[00:45:00]  Anthony's daycare oasis.  I hate your kid  and I wish him dead.  Just take it  from Anthony himself.  Grab your little  friggin' rat  and say,  We love you, Anthony.

[00:47:30]  And we're back.  It's the ONA virus  spreading across America  thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  Big thank you  to our faithful listeners  helping us out  with the program  on a daily basis.  A couple things.  If you have audio  for the show,  people are still  sending it to me.  I got a very primitive  email thing going on  and I can't like  forward the files  off to Steve  and stuff. 
[00:48:00]  Why is that?  I don't know.  We get so much email.  I don't know.  It's just a very simple program.  So if you do have audio  for the show,  you can send it to me  so I can check it out.  That's great.  But also send it  to Steve  at foundrymusic.com  Want to say hi  to the message board people?  Whackbag.com  opianthony.net  wowfans.com  cringehumor.net  And sblueman.com  I think we've been  neglected.  Oh, is he rocking again?  Well, he's got  something up there.  It's really colorful  and they have a nice  message board,  I believe it's true.  Do we have his link 
[00:48:30]  up on opianthony.com?  All these links  should be up there  by now.  Yeah.  Yes, Ben.  Speaking of which,  did you guys see  that Club Soda Kenny  is up for an award  on Cringe Humor?  Yeah, what's going on  with Cringe Humor.net?  They're giving out  awards or something?  Yeah, they give out  awards.  And our own Big and Stupid  is up for one?  What's he up for?  I don't know,  he just sent out  an email to all of us.  Yeah, he sends it  to like the bigwigs  at XM Satellite  down in Washington.  Yeah, here's the email.  It says,  This is on  cringehumor.com  Please vote for me.  My campaign slogan is 
[00:49:00]  I am big  and I am stupid.  Thank you.  Your Friend Club Soda Kenny.  And I'm looking at  who this is CCTO.  Yeah, three VPs.  Kevin Straley.  Yeah.  There's like, yeah,  three XM vice presidents.  Elo, the vice president.  Why does he send  these emails  to these bigwigs  over at XM?  And they wonder  why they're taken seriously.  Yeah, and they wonder  why they're not  taking him seriously  down there.  I thought the Big and Stupid  thing was kind of a gag,  but he's really big 
[00:49:30]  and stupid.  And what award  is he up for?  Do we even know?  I don't know.  Can we get some research  on that, Ben?  Probably most likely  to accidentally  kill a prostitute.  Let the voting begin.  The polls  for the 2004  cringies  have officially  opened.  Let's see.  I'm up for a couple  of things.  You guys are up  for something?  Oh, nice.  All right.  Ben is in the studio.  We have a brand new  Herky Jerky  Ben song.  What's the matter, Ben?  I think we have a couple. 
[00:50:00]  I don't know where  the other one is.  I'll have to find it,  but this one was done  to the Friends theme.  Oh, I heard this one.  Oh, wait, we got Pat  from CringeHumor.net  on the line.  Hold on.  That's Patrick?  Yeah, we haven't.  I don't think we've had  Pat on the new show,  have we?  No.  Hey, Pat.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hi, Patrick.  First appearance  on the new show?  It's an honor, guys.  Thanks for having me on.  CringeHumor.net.  Great little website.  So what's up  with the cringies, Pat?  Yes, it's voted  the most worthless awards  by every comedian  working out there.  You can go and 
[00:50:30]  go and catch your vote  for who you love  or who you hate  in the world of comedy.  All right,  and what is  Club Soda Kenny up for?  He's up for  a breakthrough performer.  He emerged out of nowhere  and is good luck  by everyone.  Which performer  do you think  took their career  to the next level  in 2004?  Okay.  And it is  Club Soda Kenny?  Yes, he went  pretty much from  Dice's lackey  to the legend  that he is today.  He's against 
[00:51:00]  Laurie Kilmartin,  Russ Meneve,  Jim Norton,  Steve Byrne,  and Club Soda Kenny.  Yeah, it's pretty good  company aside from  Norton in there.  So it's going to be  pretty close.  But I think  little Jimmy's pretty much  dominating the polls  right now.  I don't know.  Kenny might make a move.  I know.  I think  maybe if he rallied  all his fans together  he could, you know.  All three of them?  A little closer.  Little Jimmy also  in the running for  performer, 
[00:51:30]  best comedian in 2004.  Who am I up against?  I'm acting like I haven't  It looks like  every comic working  in New York.  I'm acting like I haven't  gone there and voted yet.  Like, just coincidentally,  who is that?  Who is that?  Yeah.  We totally snubbed  Dane Cook this year  just to really annoy him  because he won  last year  by like 5,000 votes.  Really?  Well, Dane,  I got credit where it's due.  Dane has a mailing list  of about 40,000 fat chicks  and he will send out  a mass mailing  and they go and vote.  I mean, Dane,  Dane knows what he's doing.  All right.  He's winning the Comedy Central shit  by like 10,000 votes.  It's insane, so. 
[00:52:00]  Okay, cool.  Is he mad that you snubbed him?  Yeah, he was a little cranky  about it, but you know.  I look cranky.  I can imagine.  Thank you, Pat.  All right, guys.  Bye, sweetie.  Good website,  critchhumor.net.  Been supporting the show.  Support the show  when we were doing  nothing for two years.  Yep.  So here's the latest  Herky Jerky Ben song.  Cool.  Done to the Friends theme.  Did you vote for me, Anthony?  Yes, I did.  Thank you. 
[00:52:30]  So they all tell you  that you need to book some guests.  Even little Jimmy mocks you  when he's got meaty breasts.  Your massive duties  always clog your drain.  As you've heard  in jerking gossip,  it's all crazy nuts insane.  Herky Jerky Ben  There's no way  he'll sit still.  Good old gravy leg  As the shit starts to spill. 
[00:53:00]  Herky Jerky Ben  Combs his hair  with the windmill.  You know,  if the guy  cleans up the vocals,  it's not that bad.  The vocals come right at you.  It's a little harsh,  but it sounds like  he sang that in a tin can.  I know.  It's kind of catchy  if he smooths out  the vocals, right?  Yeah, but he didn't sing  like Cagney  at the end of White Heat.  And if it was 1993.  I did enjoy that, though, 
[00:53:30]  lyrically.  Why not?  Lyrically,  it was fun.  I love the Herky Jerky.  Herky Jerky.  Almighty, dude.  I mean, I know I'm awful.  Couldn't you have just  written it and hired  someone to sing it?  Jerky Jerky Ben  Combs his hair  with a windmill.  Is there another  Herky Jerky song?  I don't think it's this one  because that's...  Oh, that was by  DJ New Style?  That was the acoustic version.  Oh, this is...  Oh, all right.  Well, that was DJ New Style.  I think there's another  Ben song around here somewhere. 
[00:54:00]  It was.  Yeah, we'll find it.  Our intern is creepy.  Which one?  The new one.  You don't like the new one?  I don't dislike him.  He's just creepy.  What a coincidence.  His name is Noah.  Yeah.  Just like the one that left.  A little biblical oddball.  Makes things...  Makes things handy.  Okay.  We're suggesting no matter  what intern we get,  we ought to just name them  the intern's name  that left.  That would make it easy  for everyone involved.  I just started,  you know,  calling these guys  by their real names.  Yeah.  It took three months  and then one of them  leaves on us. 
[00:54:30]  Well, we lost Mike and Noah.  But thank God  we replaced Noah  with a Noah,  so that's going to be easy now.  Very easy indeed.  Well, who did we lose?  We lost Mike and Noah, right?  We have two other guys.  No, we got the cream  of the crop still here, man.  We got two new guys, though, right?  We had the one...  We have Derek,  who's unbelievable,  Nathaniel,  who's unbelievable,  and now I have to say  Danny's unbelievable, too.  Yes, yes.  All three of them  are just kicking ass for us.  But who are the two new ones  plus this guy?  We have three new ones.  I don't know.  Who cares?  Right, Eric?  We have Travis  and Angelo.  Okay, and then this guy  is Noah.  All right.  We got to find 
[00:55:00]  the other Ben song.  It's around here somewhere.  All right, so we got  two clips of anchors fighting.  The first one happened  this morning.  It's kind of subtle.  We're in our office  kind of getting the show together,  and we're watching  ABC News here in New York,  and hey, Ben,  who are the anchors?  Do you remember?  It's the weather guy,  and then...  Steve Bernstein  or Bernstein  or something like that?  Yeah, who had some crazy  stuff happen to him  off air.  Like, supposedly,  he's a homosexual man, 
[00:55:30]  and he was stalking...  Wow.  He was stalking somebody else  with a laser pointer  and all sorts of crap.  Which one?  The weather guy  or the other guy?  The other guy.  The newsreader.  Oh, the...  They're just newsreaders.  The mulatto guy?  Mulatto?  He looks black and white.  Mulatto?  What are you talking about?  He looks black and white.  The guy looks half black,  half white.  Mulatto's not bad.  It's insulting.  It's insulting.  He's half a black guy?  The one that was on the left?  Yeah.  Bertlestein or whatever?  Oh, he's not black. 
[00:56:00]  I thought he was half black,  half black.  Wow, that's weird,  because I thought...  Both of you guys thought that?  Yeah.  Wow, I didn't see that at all.  He looks...  Oh, there's our friend from Fox.  There's our buddy.  No, he looks light-skinned.  He does.  Dude, you don't see him  as a black guy?  Honestly, no.  I see him as, I think,  a Jewish guy.  Yeah, he's Jewish.  Is he?  I would assume he is.  What was the last name?  But what was the story with him?  He had a crazy stalking charge, man.  Yeah, into crystal meth,  and he was stalking like one of the...  Are you kidding?  It was while we were off the air.  How is he still a news guy? 
[00:56:30]  I don't know.  Did we find that story?  It was great.  It was in the post.  It's an unbelievable story.  Oh, then it's got to be true.  Oh, see?  Are you taping this?  Yes.  All right, because they are plugging us.  I knew they would.  All right.  They got Arlie Ernie in studio.  Arlie Ernie is in studio with them  at Fox and Friends.  He loves us.  We've got to get him on the show.  Is there any way we could call  Fox and Friends?  He loves us, this guy.  Clint from New Mexico.  How much do you want him out here?  Oh, please.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Brian, dude.  They had on yesterday morning  just gave you a plug on the show. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, good.  Was it a nice plug?  It was good.  He said you guys are back on XM.  Uh-huh.  I said you love the man-cow.  We said we love man-cow?  That's what he said.  Oh, my God.  That's so not true.  Oh, God.  Was he being sarcastic?  Probably.  I don't know.  I was listening to you guys.  I had it on mute,  and I read it on the caption.  We did not say we love man-cow.  Oh, my God.  Don't start that crap.  Oh, please.  He asks us about him.  We're like, you know, I guess...  No, we said we have the same agent.  Thank you. 
[00:57:30]  Good night.  Good morning.  All right.  Well, we'll get the audio.  I want to get him in the studio, man.  I love him.  I know.  We might have missed out  because he does great stuff for us.  So, anyway, they're finding the story,  but so it's Steve,  and then the weather guy,  and they're doing a story  about Donald Trump's future bride's...  The Trumpster.  Future bride's dress, I guess.  Yeah.  Yeah, and Steve was supposed to read it  because he's the news reader.  Yeah.  That's all these guys are.  They take their job so seriously.  All they do is read teleprop.  That's it.  Even Dan Rather and, you know, 
[00:58:00]  well, Tom Brokaw's now retired.  That's all those guys do,  but they're looked at like these  informative newsmen.  They don't do anything but read.  You're a reader.  Peter Jennings, you know,  they're all just reading the news.  That's it.  Yeah, other people write it,  and they read it.  As much as I don't like them,  I have more respect for people  like, you know, Bill O'Reilly.  He's giving his opinion,  and he's, you know,  discussing things.  You know, but these other guys,  they just read the news.  That's it.  That's it. 
[00:58:30]  Actually, I like Keith Overman the best.  He's just a subject.  Teddy Overman?  What?  I thought you said Teddy Overman.  I said Keith.  Oh, all right.  Teddy Overman.  Dude, I'll mess up enough on my own.  No, no, I didn't think you were messing up.  I just thought you were talking about  Teddy Overman.  I was going to go bowling with him.  See, I don't know this reference.  I don't know.  Damn it.  I hate when I don't get him.  Don't even tell me.  You've got to go through your box set  a little longer.  Oh, the Honeymooners?  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm bowling with Teddy Overman.  Teddy Overman.  What a louse that Teddy Overman is. 
[00:59:00]  I'm only up to the fourth episode.  Oh.  Yeah.  I got through the maid.  Yeah.  And what was the one after that?  I don't remember the order.  All right.  Anyway, so they're doing a story  on Donald Trump's future bride's dress  and Steve's supposed to read the story.  I guess he messed up the name or something.  He gets the name wrong.  I'm not sure if he got the name  of the bride wrong of Donald's girlfriend  or the name of the dressmaker or something,  but he screwed up the name.  Right.  And the weather guy decides 
[00:59:30]  it's a good time to point out  that he screwed up the name.  And what does he think?  He's on this show  where we do that on a daily basis  and just relish in someone's mistake?  Yeah, we don't even try  to do the radio show anymore.  We just stare at each other just waiting.  Waiting for someone to mess up.  Come on.  Screw a line up.  Come on.  Norton was first today.  Thank God.  But we all know it happens to us every day  and it's funny  and we goof on it  and you laugh  because you feel like an idiot  or sometimes it screws up  a really funny line.  Right.  Because you're so eager  to get it out of your stupid mouth. 
[01:00:00]  Oh.  That's like my major problem.  I do it all the time.  We're talking.  I get a line in my head.  I'm waiting for the gap  so I can throw it in there.  I'm all happy, proud, confident of it.  You throw it out  and just an abortion  flies out from between your gums  and everyone just laughs at you  and you turn all red,  you get hot, sweaty.  It's great.  But on the news,  they seem to take it very personally.  Yeah, so he messed up something.  We'll hear it. 
[01:00:30]  I think we got the whole thing here  and then the weather guy jumps in.  He thinks it's funny.  Weather guy thinks it's funny.  Anchor guy pissed off  it was pointed out in the first place  and not letting it go.  Right.  And so they kind of go at it a little bit.  I mean, it looks like they want to fight.  Yeah.  And then the weather guy  is trying to use like a little  like sense of humor,  kind of laugh,  like he goofed on it kind of thing.  Like, hey, let it go.  And the anchor guy is just plain pissed  and the girl in the middle  is just trying to diffuse the situation.  And this show,  we watch it a lot in the morning. 
[01:01:00]  We start at Channel 7  and then we, you know,  we switch around.  It's kind of a...  They're not too serious to begin with.  They're kind of just hanging out,  giving you the news,  laughing a little bit, you know?  But not as wacky as like Fox and Friends.  Right.  No, no.  Yeah.  So here's the audio.  Oh, the weatherman's Bill Evans.  Thank you.  So here's the exchange  that happened this morning  about an hour ago.  Have you seen this?  This is a big dress.  Something old,  something new,  and something that costs  about a hundred grand. 
[01:01:30]  Here's a look at the wedding dress  made for supermodel  Melania Nouse,  the former,  or the future,  Ms.  Let's...  Wait, wait,  go over that name again.  All right, yeah, that's it.  He just butchered her name.  Melania Nouse.  I thought he said Melania Nouse,  which might be...  Is that the way it says?  I don't know.  It's not like Melania Nouse.  I thought he said Melania Nouse.  I couldn't even tell you her name.  It's one of those names.  He did kind of mumble it.  Yeah.  He panicked.  You can tell.  You can tell there's a little gap  between when he says...  You know, we've all been  in that situation as broadcasters. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  You just hope to get through it.  Yeah.  Like, I'll get it close enough  where I'm...  You know, and I'll get past it  and then no one will point it out.  Not with Jimmy here.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  You've wrecked my whole thing.  My whole bit.  That's the beauty of what we do.  We just goof on each other.  It's like,  why can't a broadcaster like that  just go,  wait a minute.  How do you say that?  Why can't there be any honesty  out of these people?  Well, they start...  They'll say, okay,  go do the weether.  You know?  Just goof on it.  I guess he wants to be known  as a serious newsreader  and, you know,  these guys are pointing out  that he doesn't know  that he butchered the name. 
[01:02:30]  Right.  Have you seen this?  This is the new dress.  Something old,  something new,  and something that costs  about a hundred grand.  Here's a look at the wedding dress  made for supermodel  Melania Nels,  the former or the future,  Mr. President.  Wait, wait,  go over that name again,  Steve.  What was that?  You know what?  Why don't you do it, Bill?  No, I'm not the anchor, Steve.  Melania, right?  Why don't you go over it?  What'd you do it?  I'm not the anchor.  Well, you know what, then?  I'll pipe down over there  during the video, wouldn't you?  Well, then what then, Steve?  Go ahead, do it, Bill. 
[01:03:00]  It has 300 feet of satin.  If you're not the anchor,  then don't interrupt me.  I just,  I wanted to know what you said.  If you're not the anchor,  then don't...  Go, baby, go.  Go.  The guy was designed  by John Galliano  for Kristen, New York.  And the bride plans  another dress of  era-wing design  after the couple's  first dance wedding  is set for Saturday.  Why don't you give it  a shot there, Bill?  Hey, I'm just  representing the audience.  I'm just representing...  I heard...  I'm just representing...  I heard...  My mouth, and I'm just saying...  My bad, my bad.  I'm sorry, Bill.  I'm not looking  for an apology, Steve. 
[01:03:30]  I'm not saying...  I'm sorry.  Would you like  to take another shot?  No, I wouldn't.  I don't know.  I can't take a shot at it.  That's why I do the weather.  I don't read that stuff.  It is so cold outside.  It is cold outside.  It's cold in here, too.  Take a shot at the weather  if you want to.  I don't know.  I'm good with that.  Hey, dude, I'm...  Okay.  I get paid either way.  Oh, you, you, you, you, you.  It's just cool.  The weather will start today.  And it will be a day  where it will be a cold day.  Wow.  That's even better 
[01:04:00]  than what we...  How we heard in the office  because we were half listening.  That is an angry...  You know what really angered him?  Wow, that's great.  You could tell  what really angered him  as he was then finishing  his read.  The guy, the weather guy  is cackling like Ben  in the background.  Did you hear that?  No, I didn't catch that.  He screws up.  They have their first exchange.  Then the anchor decides  he's going to finish  the rest of the voiceover,  the rest of the read.  As he's doing that,  you just hear...  You hear this Ben-like cackle 
[01:04:30]  and it just really pisses him off.  Was that the weather guy laughing  or the Robin Quiver's girl?  The weather guy.  Oh, okay.  It's the weather guy  laughing at the anchor guy.  The weather guy at least  was cool.  What a douche the anchor is.  Well, because he wants  to be known as a serious  guy's reader.  Douche.  Why don't you read it?  Why don't you read it?  Instead of just going,  yeah, I screwed that up.  Because the weather guy,  even after the weather guy  realized that he offended  him a little bit,  he was trying to keep it  lighthearted.  Yeah.  Like any guy would do,  but this faggot's all  self-important.  You should have said,  what do I care 
[01:05:00]  what her name is anyway?  Yeah.  You zilch of questionable  ethnicity.  And then they broke down  the third wall, too,  because he's like,  well, why don't you  just be quiet then  during the VO?  Yeah.  The voiceover.  Did he say the VO?  I didn't hear that.  Yeah, he said the VO.  Oh, I thought he meant  podcast.  Which proves this wasn't  a little fun-loving exchange.  This was like,  no, also,  just shut the F up.  Can we play it again?  He says things a couple  of times,  which shows that  it's not a joke.  He seriously means it.  Well, did you catch it  when he goes,  well, I'm the anchor,  don't interrupt me?  Yeah.  And the other guy goes,  well, I didn't mean 
[01:05:30]  to interrupt you, faggot.  Sorry, I don't have  a laser pointer  that you can stalk me with.  You didn't catch that?  Wow.  We're trying to find  the story,  because the story  is unbelievable.  That really is awkward.  It's Steve Bartlestein,  it's Bill Evans,  the weatherman,  who points out  him messing up.  Yeah, let's hear it again.  And then the female  in the middle  is Sandra Bookman,  who's kind of  loosey-goosey  all morning  on this newscast.  I know who she is.  Her father used to be  a janitor on Good Times.  Of course he was.  Bookman, yeah.  I know that.  That one I know. 
[01:06:00]  Sandra Booger  is the name I call her.  Want to listen to it again?  And then we got  another audio  that probably trumps  this one.  Oh, yeah.  So listen again here.  Have you seen this?  This is a new dress.  Something old,  something new,  and something that costs  about a hundred grand.  Here's a look at the wedding dress  made for supermodel  Melania Nels,  the former,  or the future,  Mr.  Let's...  Wait, wait,  go over that name again,  Steve.  What was that?  You know what?  Why don't you do it, Bill?  No, I'm not the anchor, Steve.  Melania, right?  Why don't you go over it? 
[01:06:30]  What'd you do it?  I'm not the anchor.  Well, you know what, then?  Then I'll pipe down over there  during the video.  Well, then what then, Steve?  Go ahead and do it, Bill.  It has 300 feet of satin.  If you're not the anchor,  then don't interrupt me.  I would just...  I wanted to know  what you said.  No, if you're not the anchor,  then don't...  Go, baby, go.  Go.  The guy was designed  by John Galliano  for Christian New York.  Wow, does she call a baby?  No, she said,  go, baby, go.  Like, yeah.  And then here's where  he's cackling.  He's just cackling like Ben.  Yeah.  Laughing at Steve.  He's cackling.  His hair's all messy. 
[01:07:00]  He's doing coke  off the weather map.  I would just...  I wanted to know  if you're not the anchor,  then don't...  Go, baby, go.  Go.  The guy was designed  by John Galliano  for Christian New York.  And the guy plans  another dress  of era-wearing design  after the couple's  first dance.  Wedding is set for Saturday.  Why don't you  give it a shot there, Bill?  Hey, I'm just  representing the audience.  I'm just representing...  I heard...  I heard...  My mouth.  And I'm just...  My bad.  My bad.  I'm sorry, Bill.  I heard...  I'm not looking  for an apology, Steve.  I'm just saying,  would you like to 
[01:07:30]  take another shot?  No, I wouldn't.  I don't know.  I can't take a shot at it.  That's why I knew  the weather.  I don't read that stuff.  I don't read that stuff.  It is so cold outside.  It's cold in here, too.  Oh.  Take a shot at the weather  if you want to.  I don't know.  I don't matter.  I'm good with that.  Hey, dude.  Okay.  I get paid either way.  It's so cold when the weather  will start to die.  And it will be a day  where it will be a cold day.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  I like the weather, man. 
[01:08:00]  I wanted to get attention before.  I just heard...  He mocked him.  He mocked him in the middle of it.  I just heard...  And the weatherman comes off  looking like a fun guy  and the other guy  looks like an absolute douche.  He's calling him Billy.  Yeah, why don't you try it, Billy?  Why don't you try it, Billy?  Hey, Billy boy.  We so lucked out.  That was a good one.  We were just recording today.  We lucked out.  It was like Ben cackling  and he gets up  and takes his monstrous hog  and points at the weatherman.  It's going to be cold here.  Where? 
[01:08:30]  He's pointing to Alaska  and Idaho at the same time.  That's great, isn't it?  That is really good.  These stupid news readers,  they take their jobs  way too seriously  and they don't want you  pointing out that  they flubbed something.  Anyway, yeah,  this happened while we were  off the air.  Steve Bartlestein,  who was in that clip  with Bill Evans,  the weather guy,  new sex suit  hits anchor.  Transmitted various  communicable diseases 
[01:09:00]  according to the New York Post.  What?  Who did?  It looks like Steve Bartlestein.  Oh.  I don't know.  This is August 5th, 2003.  WABC TV news anchor  Steve Bartlestein  is being sued by a second man  for sexual harassment  and stalking.  A man?  Yeah, that's what we're saying.  Yeah.  With the laser pointer  and all that.  Actor Dan Levine  claims Bartlestein  filed him to Boston  and Denver.  That guy we just heard  in the clip  filed this other guy  to Boston and Denver  forcing him  to switch hotels 
[01:09:30]  under an assumed name.  Wow.  This lawsuit is the second  of its kind  for Bartlestein  who was hit earlier this year  with a sexual harassment complaint  by ABC writer-producer  Roderick McCollum.  Rod.  Why don't you try it, Rod?  Yeah.  What a short-fused fruit.  Wow, really?  Why don't you stop  rubbing your mule  on other co-workers  and get a sense of humor,  sissy.  Why don't you leave  the weatherman alone?  He's having a ball over there.  He's laughing.  Don't be just  having fun  cackling in the background. 
[01:10:00]  Don't do it.  It's insane.  It's crazy.  It's millennial now.  And then he starts  gossiping about it.  Yeah, she was doing  coke with Tom Brady  in Boston.  Speaking of Boston,  low-pressure system.  He would only give  the Boston weather.  He wouldn't even mention  the tsunami.  Stupid Ben.  No matter what city  he was in,  he would just go,  hey, they're Boston.  And how it affects  either the Pats  or the Red Sox.  What a Boston nothing he is.  Who, Ben?  Yeah.  Oh, an ass  of epic proportions.  So, there you have it, man. 
[01:10:30]  That's great.  Yeah.  And you know,  Steve was just pissed off  and Evans can't stop laughing  and just make the worst.  They're still pissed.  What are you kidding?  You know they're still pissed.  All right.  And then we should  follow that up.  We have an audio  of an anchor fight  at KABC TV in LA.  Now, this was before  they went to air.  Well, obviously,  you know what?  These engineers,  they're great.  They're always recording  when they're not on.  You know what I mean?  That's why I get  a little nervous  when we're mic'd  for something.  Of course.  Like yesterday,  we get mic'd up  for the talk show  and I don't like 
[01:11:00]  discussing other people,  other things,  or anything when I'm mic'd  because you know  these guys.  And you know  these engineers  are recording  and hoping you're  going to say  something stupid  and then they trade  with their friends  all over the country  and then eventually,  you know,  someone...  It ends up on a CD  on some radio show.  Yeah, because someone  sends it to an...  Yeah, exactly.  So, I guess  they were getting ready  to air,  these two anchors.  A man and a woman...  That was brutal, Jimmy.  You nailed the new guy.  A man and a woman  team there. 
[01:11:30]  You know,  that's really good.  The typical anchors,  you know.  Yeah.  Guy and a girl.  Can we know  in here, please?  No.  We're going to, like,  completely wreck the flow.  What are you doing?  You know what?  Why don't you just do it?  Oh.  No, no, no.  I was just...  I was just trying  to have some fun.  Come on, Jimmy,  buddy, boy.  Yeah, let's do it, Jimmy.  Come on, Jimmy.  You do it, Jimmy.  You do it, Jimmy.  Hey, I'm not the star  of the show.  Hey, you do the setup.  I don't give a fuck.  I didn't mean to talk  during the VO.  Whatever, dude.  I'll just sit here.  During the VO.  I get paid either way. 
[01:12:00]  Whatever, man.  Yeah, he threw that line in,  which is total personal.  Oh, I know.  All right, so,  yeah, this is just  before they go to air.  And obviously,  these two just hate each other  and have a problem.  Problems.  A lot of guy-girl teams  in any broadcasting forum  usually don't like each other.  I got to explain.  The neighborhood I live in,  these people that do,  that read the news, Anthony,  you know,  between the 6 o'clock  and 11 o'clock,  they got like four or five hours  because they're really  just reading the news.  It's the people behind the scenes 
[01:12:30]  that have to put the whole thing  together for these guys  and throw it on a teleprop.  So, what happens  with these anchors  and the sports guys  and the weather guys?  Some teleprompter.  Oh, what did I say?  Teller?  You can throw that in on there.  What do you call it?  What?  What?  Teleprop?  Want to take another shot  at that word, Hope?  All I heard was  Noah,  Jimmy wanted you  for something.  Welcome to the show. 
[01:13:00]  I just saw your coat  and I wanted to know  if you were...  What?  I saw his coat.  It looks terrific.  I wanted to know  if you were auditioning  for Purple Rain.  What is that?  A velour blazer?  What is that made of?  Is that velveteen?  It's made of velvet.  Is it velvet?  Is it real velvet?  I think so, yeah.  You're not trying to make  an impression or anything,  are you?  No.  Did you pick that out  this morning  specifically for this  and say,  I'm going to have to wear  my velvet blazer?  No, not at all.  Are you playing horns  with Murph  and the Murph tones? 
[01:13:30]  I don't think so.  That is something.  All right.  And is that a guest shirt  underneath?  Uh, no.  No.  All right,  because I think  I got that same shirt.  Don't ever wear that shirt again,  just in case I wear mine.  I promise you won't.  All right.  It would be very awkward  if we came in  with the same shirt.  That would be really awkward.  Me a big time radio star  and you a coffee getter.  A lonely intern.  That wouldn't work. 
[01:14:00]  All right,  welcome to the program.  Where do you live?  I don't care.  No, you don't really care.  I like him.  You won't even remember tomorrow  if I ask you  where the new intern lives.  That's not true.  Union Square.  Good luck to you.  We'll start acknowledging it  in about a month.  Oh.  Am I going to be the guy  that tells him  to leave his pack back here  and don't take it out  on patrol with him  and I'll carry it for you?  I don't have to be  the nice guy.  He's Charlie Garner.  Yeah, Charlie Garner. 
[01:14:30]  Wow, very good name.  You picked that out of your ass.  That was good.  I couldn't find that one.  What, are you going to stay here  for the rest of the show?  Yeah, what are you doing?  I don't have to do it all.  Yeah, I wouldn't mind.  You want to intro the clip  or something?  All right.  See, that's why Eric's  opening the door.  You can leave anything.  Oh, God.  All right, slam the door  in his face.  We got a show to do.  All right.  On his way out,  Jimmy, just one-size him.  All right.  Where were we?  Oh, yeah.  So, in my hood there, 
[01:15:00]  you know, it's near  one of these news stations  and these guys hang out  at coffee shops  and smoke cigars  and eat in between  the 6 and 11 o'clock news.  Yeah.  And a lot of these anchors  and news people and stuff,  they have family  so they actually go home  for a few hours  because they have nothing to do  until they have to read again  off that thing  that shows the words.  So, I think what's going on  in this clip  is the female anchor goes home.  For like,  in between the newscasts.  I believe so  because the male anchor 
[01:15:30]  kind of brings up  her drinking.  He eludes.  He eludes that she might  be drinking  in the tall newscasts.  This is brutal.  Oh, I didn't hear this.  Yeah, this is brutal.  You thought the one  we just played was good?  Listen to this exchange  just before they hit the air,  Jimmy.  First segment.  It's done that way  all the time.  It frequently is.  It frequently is.  Well, then we better  talk about it.  You hear me complaining about it?  Then we better talk about it.  Tonight I'm complaining  because tonight I said play.  We better talk about it  because I think  you've got a problem.  I think we've got a problem.  All right?  If that's what you think, 
[01:16:00]  then we'll talk about it  after the show  and we'll talk about it  with Roger Bell  because I'm not going  to sit here night after night  and put up with this shit.  Okay?  Night after night?  Night after night?  Well, it looks to me  like that's the way  it's going to go, Ann.  I'll take the ante up  a little higher than that even.  You're not only wrong,  you're way out of line.  Let me tell you something.  You started it, pal.  If you want Harold Green,  you might get him.  That's fine with me.  Fine with me.  Oh, is it really?  Good old Harold Green.  Okay.  Okay. 
[01:16:30]  You want to start  dealing with shit?  Go ahead.  That's what you want.  You just might get it.  You know,  you go home  and have a couple of shooters  and I don't know  what the fuck happens  but when you come back  you're not the same lady.  That's nuts.  Some nights it is, Ann.  When news happens,  you see it happen  on Channel 7.  The number one station  for news and information  in Southern California. 
[01:17:00]  Now,  Paul Moyer  and Mark  Johnny Mountainweather  and Todd Donahoe Sports.  This is  Eyewitness News  tonight.  Three men dead tonight  in an execution-style  murder in Los Angeles.  Go right into it.  The lush sitting next to me  will explain.  Wow.  Isn't that great?  That was just before  they hit the air.  And she kept,  you know what it is?  She's such a drunk.  She kept talking  when he was trying  to say something  and he just had  enough of her mouth.  Yep.  Was he stapling things?  I don't know. 
[01:17:30]  It sounded like something  just slamming down  on the desk.  He was shuffling his papers,  I think,  and just hitting the desk, right?  Oh, he was just kind of like  putting him down hard.  Slapping him down.  There is a problem there, boy.  We'll have to work  in that environment.  Who are those names  you kept mentioning?  You're going to get this?  I'll probably, you know,  the boss.  The boss, yeah.  The program director,  whatever,  that runs the newsroom.  Are they still together  or you don't know?  Are they still a team?  I don't know.  I don't know the history  of that clip.  Steve might know.  Eric, what's the history  of that clip, please? 
[01:18:00]  He's going to just say,  I don't know.  Don't know.  He's just going to say,  I don't know.  Tell him that he got out.  Getting back to the Steve  Barlestein, we've got more.  Oh, really?  Yeah, you Google his name,  you find some fun stuff.  That was the first clip  we played.  Worst off-camera behavior,  WABC News anchor,  Steve Barlestein,  who is being sued  by two men  for sexual harassment.  One of the men  is an ABC News producer.  The court documents  include juicy bits  of information.  One of the men  claims that Barlestein  uses crystal meth  and crack every day  and knowingly transmitted  various communicable diseases. 
[01:18:30]  Testy anchor with chlamydia.  How annoying is that?  Self-righteous  and disease-ridden.  Yuck.  How is he still an anchor?  I know.  Like the slightest  little thing.  Well, that guy yesterday,  the weatherman in Vegas,  made quite the little faux pas.  We don't have audio of this,  but...  Oh, Anthony, yeah,  here, I'll give that to you.  What a faux pas  this guy made  and right out the door.  And meanwhile,  you get this guy  in New York,  he's...  chlamydia and crack 
[01:19:00]  and stalking  and he's still delivering  the news  and snippy to boot.  Las Vegas,  a weekend television weatherman  was fired after he made  an on-air racial slur  about Martin Luther King Jr.,  station official said.  Rob Blair,  Rob Blair,  from a KTNV-TV,  was delivering  the extended forecast  Saturday morning  when he said,  freeze,  Martin Luther King Jr. Day.  He's going to see  some temperatures  in the mid-60s. 
[01:19:30]  So, it sounds like  he said Martin Luther Coon  and then went King Jr.  You got to be fired for that.  I got to...  I despise political correctness,  but you know what?  When you say  Martin Luther Coon  on television  on his birthday...  Pretty much...  You got to go.  Sometimes political correctness  has a point.  Now, some say,  some would say,  well, obviously,  it was a slip of the tongue.  I don't think anybody  in their right mind  would go on television 
[01:20:00]  and say this.  Yes.  On purpose.  But, I guess there's...  If it was a slip of the tongue,  why would you even make it  unless you've been saying it  all day?  You know,  it's kind of one of those slips  that you just...  I don't know,  Luther kind of has that  ooh sound to it  going into a king.  You might...  Have you ever done that?  You cross up two words?  Constantly.  But, you know,  yeah, this is one of those  how do you explain it?  It could have been  the most innocent slip  in the world,  but it sounds like  he was going to say cool. 
[01:20:30]  No, oh, you heard it.  No, I don't know.  It just seems like he was...  Well, it sounds like  Martin Luther  and then you got that  ooh from Luther  stuck in your head.  You go to king,  starts with a k sound,  and you're already  halfway through Coon.  He was probably just joking  with his friend saying,  yeah, Martin Luther  is going tomorrow.  Just joking around.  I've mixed up words before.  Like, a lot of times  a girl will say,  you're going to tell me, right?  And I'll say yes,  but what I really mean is  no.  You'll find out  when your tonsils  are bleachy, stupid. 
[01:21:00]  Let's see.  Jim Prather,  vice president  and general manager,  said Blair stumbled,  but the excuse  was not good enough  to save his job.  This kind of incident  is not acceptable  under any circumstances,  and I'm truly sorry  that this event occurred,  Prather told  the Las Vegas Review-Journal.  Blair apologized,  waddle-doodle,  during the station  6 p.m.  and 11 p.m.  newscast.  So the guy got on  twice after that  and apologized.  On a weather report 
[01:21:30]  early this morning,  I made an accidental  slip of the tongue  when talking about  the Martin Luther  King-Koon holiday.  No, he didn't say that.  He actually got it  right that time.  He said the Martin Luther  King holiday,  and what I said  was interpreted  by many viewers  as highly offensive.  Interpreted?  No, it was highly offensive.  For that,  I offer my deepest apology.  I in no way  intended to offend anyone.  I'm very sorry.  Waddle-doodle.  Well, he also said  in an interview,  he said,  I don't want you  to think I was happy.  It's not like I got up  and danced a jig.  Oh, which he was fired again. 
[01:22:00]  Blair worked at the station  for about three months,  so he's kind of  new meat over there.  Yeah, yeah.  It's kind of spooky.  New guy doing it.  All right.  Well, they didn't like him  around the office anyway.  He never bought lunch.  He behaved very niggardly.  Oh, wow.  Yes.  I mean, it's cheap,  I believe.  Yes, it does.  Yes.  Hey, Cal, what's up?  Hey, I used to live  out in Southern California  and used to watch  the news out there,  and Ann Martin is a blonde. 
[01:22:30]  You're kind of  an attractive older lady.  I'd do it  if I had a chance,  but Paul Moyer's  just a fucking asshole.  Are they still on the air?  Are they still on the air?  They're still on the air,  yeah.  They're still on the air.  They're that green guy  who used to be  a news anchor,  and now he's like  a director or something  like that.  All right.  How's her drinking problem?  What's that?  How's her drinking  coming along?  Yeah, he referred to  her as a drinker.  She does a few shoots.  She doesn't seem like that.  She just seems like 
[01:23:00]  one of them  little sophisticated  older ladies.  These guys in the news  anchors out in L.A.  are so stuck on themselves  thinking they're going  to get some kind of  Hollywood bullshit  that it don't even  make sense.  Hey, Dan Aykroyd voice,  how long ago  did you live in California?  I lived in Southern California  pretty much my entire life.  I live up in Utah now,  but it's been only  a couple years back.  You ever live in  Cook County, Chicago,  did you?  Not even, Jimmy.  Suck.  All right.  Thank you, Cal.  County, Chicago.  Not a bad-looking  older broad.  Steve is saying  that that clip 
[01:23:30]  is 10 years old?  No.  Yeah, it has to be  because Moyer and Martin  weren't at that news,  weren't at ABC  since 1994.  Wow.  Are they still a team?  No.  No.  One of them's at  CBS, one of them's at ABC.  Well, our clip is  two hours old.  Exactly.  We really lucked out  on that today.  Okay.  That was a good one.  We got to step aside.  We got this Nina Gordon  doing straight out of  Compton.  Really?  I think she's ripping  off your brother.  Oh, the thing he did,  the James Taylor song he did? 
[01:24:00]  DMX up in here.  DMX, right.  Same basic principle?  Yeah, Nina Gordon  is singing  Straight Outta Compton  a different way here.  Nice.  As we go to break.

Yeah, where the listeners won't notice  And we could eat food  Because they hate when we eat on the air  Sorry  I'm doing some granola today  With blueberries 
[01:28:30]  I got blueberries  Mmm, granola  Granola with blueberries this morning  In case you're keeping track  Does that bind you up, O.B.?

Yeah, my whole system  Can't figure it out  And then I'm eating  You know  Stupid food  Because  I'm not hungry for anything  And you've got to get something in your stomach 
[01:29:00]  So it's  You probably don't eat enough fruit, Opie  Fruit?  Your blueberries aren't enough  No  You've got to have grapies  And plenty of bananas  I do the bananas  I do the bananas  I got two little bananas today  Did you notice that?  Yeah, of course  Usually the intern brings me this giant schlong  Horse schlong of a banana  And I feel all self-conscious eating it  That I have to break it up into pieces  Put it down on something  And pick up individual pieces  Because I don't want people looking at me 
[01:29:30]  Shoving this hog in my mouth  Guys  It's a big banana  Guys just don't eat bananas whole  No  Ever  Imagine you're like that big tough guy  On the work site there  Yeah  Just doing a construction job  Sitting down to look at all the lovely ladies  As they walk by during lunch  And you're eating a banana  You're a big hog of a banana  In front of everybody  You know what it is?  If somebody's doing something  And you look at them quickly  You get an image in your head  And it sticks there  It's like a photograph 
[01:30:00]  So if you're eating a banana  And you know  You see someone open their mouth real wide  And shove that in  And you happen to look at that moment  You get this  Like 12 photo in your head  Can't have that  Which is why  When you have the two bananas  The first thing Anthony does  Is look at me  And he holds one  And he takes his other hand  And he pumps up and down  On the banana real quick  And then he picks both of them up  And he puts them both by his face  Yeah  We're in the middle of doing the show  And I'm making Jimmy laugh  They brought me two bananas today  Brought me two little bananas 
[01:30:30]  Instead of the one big one  Banana diva  So I started making these  Double dong J-O jokes to Jimmy  And I had them on my chest  And I'm jacking them  Dude  And this is why men are funnier by the way  Every time he would do that  I would laugh  Yeah  Because it doesn't take a lot for us  It's ridiculous  And now a chick was in here  She's  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Every time  That's funny  Speaking of which  That's quite the judgment call  On the intern's part  To think

[01:31:30]  Yeah I guess  Did you go in a real grocery store  Or one of those New York City little things  No everyone's well  Where you can't even fit through the aisles  God I hate that  Oh yeah yeah yeah  That's the grocery store I went in  That's why I love moving out to Long Island  I like the big wide aisles  Of a big huge supermarket  Bro  I'm with you  I can't wait to get back to the suburbs  I gotta figure that out  Little chintzy New York  Grocery stores with a cat  The old mangy cat walking around  The little aisles  And the cart that's from the 30s  I can't wait  Food Emporium's a good one  No it's not 
[01:32:00]  Food Emporium's got good stuff  That's alright  It's like they got five things  Jimmy you've never been to a  A supermarket  Food Emporium  You've never been to a supermarket  In the suburbs  If you think Food Emporium's nice  Dude my whole 30 years  I was in the suburbs  Sprawling  You act like I came from Rwanda  Dude I grew up in North Brunswick  You haven't lived until you  Shopped at a Wegman's  In western New York  What?  What the hell is that?  Wegman's  It was  I don't know  Voted like the top company  Last year or something  I mean they're rocking  You need the walled bombs  Out on Long Island 
[01:32:30]  The supermarket's so big  That they sell like  Patio furniture  With huge umbrellas  They sell everything  I like a supermarket  Where you walk in  And they got the  It's like a showcase of meat  In the meat section  It's like you're at a jewelry store  It's all behind glass  And beautifully glistening  Animal flesh  It's marbled  Yeah  Turned gray  What is freshdirect.com?  Order your groceries online  Oh is that what you do?  That's what I do  You're in Brooklyn  You just hibernate 
[01:33:00]  You just stay in your place  And don't leave  Because that's exactly what I did  I would order everything out  And the delivery people  Would bring it  And you just wind up  Staying in there  Like the roaches  That are in your apartments  There in Brooklyn  It's awful  Food service  Laundry  Cleaning  Everything  Just hire somebody to come in  You never leave the apartment  Someone comes to your door  You hand them stuff  Later they might bring it back  There you go  You're living in the city  I hate it  Really?  I love being in the city  So at the supermarket last week 
[01:33:30]  Speaking of bananas  That's where I was going  This was supposed to be really quick  What happened?  I don't know what happened  Because what happens every day  In the show  We just babble about nothing  For three hours  And collect a paycheck  And go home  That's the show  And no one's on to us yet  On our wedding day  I mean  We have good intentions  On this  We have good intentions  On this program  But  So in the produce department  They had this advertisement  With this  With this little boy  He's got to be  Five or six tops  This is the picture 
[01:34:00]  I'm describing now  Okay  I guess there's a  Product you could get  To dip your bananas  In chocolate  Has anyone seen this?  No  Yeah  I guess you heat up the chocolate  I don't know  Dip the bananas  Throw them in the fridge  I don't know  Makes a crisp chocolate coating  Well it makes it look like  A crisp chocolate coating  It makes your banana look like  It's tiring  I can't read it like that  Oh my god  Where is that?  It's not rewarding  It's not rewarding  Now we gotta play that  See what we do?  Find me a jury  That would say  Crisp chocolate banana coating  I wanna take banana out of there 
[01:34:30]  I just want it crisp  No this is taxing for me  Alright so  I guess it makes your banana  Look like a  A black  Yeah  You know  Right  Like a  Treat  Like an African American  Something Martin Luther Coon would have  Oh  Vegas weatherman you  The only reason I say that  Is because the advertisement  For this product  I gotta start walking around  With a digital camera  I never laughed harder  Out loud  And you know  Then you got those stupid 
[01:35:00]  Stuck up  You know  Moms that live in Manhattan  Shopping  They don't find the humor in this  And I'm laughing  Because I'm like  You gotta be kidding  This is how they're selling  This product  It's a  A blonde haired kid  Five or six  With his mouth wide open  With a bowl haircut  Holding one of these  Black  Brown  Chocolate dipped bananas  Like this  With his mouth wide open  With the banana like this  Ah  Oh  What's the name of the product  Neverland  Parts of the banana 
[01:35:30]  With the chocolate's peeled off  And it's white  You gotta think  This advertisement  Has to be online  So  If someone wants  A little project  If they can find that  And send it to us  We'll get it up  On opianathlete.com  Goes great with  Jesus juice  Mmm  Chocolate covered bananas  And Jesus juice  And little blonde boys  With a wide open mouth  It's unbelievable  Fingerprints on the  Dirty magazines  Naughty boy you are  Michael  A naughty boy  I did notice though  I went to  The supermarket last night 
[01:36:00]  And the advertisement  Is down  So I  You know  I mean this thing  Is so ridiculously  Over the top  In my opinion  And I guarantee  Where I live  These idiots  You know  Complained  And got rid of it  Do you remember  The name of the product  Because if you give that up  No I really don't  Because I was too busy  Looking at this picture  Going you gotta be kidding me  No one in the  You know  Ed department  Thought this might be a problem  I'll bet you they did  But they all went  With the mentality  Like I can't be  Immature enough  To notice that  Like the one guy  That would go look at that  And be like  What's wrong with you 
[01:36:30]  To think that  Yeah if somebody  Brought it up  At the big meeting  Yeah  Like we can't  Put that out there  It looks like  He's ready to  Hoff on a big hog  Well then I'm thinking  You know  I know there's something  Called subliminal advertising  I learned that  In Geneseo  Advertising  When I was a  Communication major  Anthony  Yes  Thank you  Thank you  They used to do that  A lot  Like  But I was gonna say  Like when they have  Advertisements of  You know ice  Like for whiskey  Or whatever  If you look at the ice cubes  There's an artist  That puts little 
[01:37:00]  Orgy scenes in there  And stuff  Look closely  You'll see all  All sorts of phallic symbols  In advertising  It's supposed to excite you  About the product  So you look at it  And subliminally  You're getting this image  Of sex  And it's supposed to  Excite you about the product  Do you know  Eatabullet.com  That there was one  Actually  Eatabullet.com  It was  The Camel cigarettes  The guy  Joe Camel  Was a cartoon  And the nose  Yes  It was male genitals  And the  Oh definitely  It was testicles  And my friend  Was in advertising  And I looked at it  And I can only see that now 
[01:37:30]  If I ever see that  Of course  And I heard female  Camel smokers went up  That could be  Really  It was aimed at women  Yeah  That could be a more  Myth  But I heard  That one is very blatantly obvious  It looks like  Yeah bullies  I saw a whole article  On that once  Years ago  And they showed a  Big picture of  Macaroni and cheese  And there was just  It was people  All intertwined  Really  You could kind of  Make it out  You know  Just enough  Yeah  Just enough  Subtly  Subtly  Big story Anthony  We love  We love pranks  We just love pranks

[01:41:30]  Yeah  And Ken would be like  I listened to the whole show  He didn't say anything  About you guys  No no  There was a reference  In the middle of that  That we took  As a slam on us  And you know what  You told us to come to you  Before we retaliate  And you know  I don't know Ken  I think if we go  On the air today  It could get a little ugly  Alright guys  See you tomorrow  Remember he would be  In a major panic  We knew  We had him  We had him  Yeah the good old days  Now forget it 
[01:42:00]  They got us chained  To this console  XM  They won't  They won't budge  For days off  Huh  No  We wanted the Monday  When we're coming back  From Vegas  Like Sunday's a travel day  We're getting in late  How about you give us  Monday off  Oh  Well we can't  The computer system  Won't handle it  You know  If you got one a day off  You're going to have to  Schedule it two weeks  In advance  Yeah you know what  We can't take a sick day  I was wondering about that  What happens when  We take that first sick day 
[01:42:30]  It's going to happen  Screwed  How are we screwed  Are we really screwed  We can't  There's no way  They can go to something  Because they have  This master computer  In Washington  We'd have to run  A live war stuff  We'd have to do it here  Without you guys  Really  Yeah  And just grab discs  And pop them in  And play it that way  And just  You know what  I'm going to be sick tomorrow  Because I want to see  How they handle it  Look at that  I'm getting there now  I have a sore throat I think  Uh oh  That sore throat thing  Has been going around forever  Alright we got to get to  Some more audio  Before we move on  Haven't been giving  Oral treats to any  Anchorman here in New York 
[01:43:00]  Haven't you  Here it's diseased  Speaking of that  We got a Jason update  That we forgot about yesterday  Voorhees  And we got to talk about  No  Isn't it very good sweater  Is he alive again  Can you get the  The story of the woman  That gave birth  The 66 year old woman  Oh yeah  Alright but first  We got some audio  To get to  And we'll move on  First of all  Really quick  A couple of shows  We're loving right now  Is Surreal Life  With Mini-Me  And Chyna  Who used to be  Part of the WWF  Or the WWE  Whatever the hell 
[01:43:30]  They're calling it these days  Phil Packer  Peter Brady  Oh Peter Brady  I like to call him  Phil Packer  Because he's old enough  To grow that mustache now  He doesn't have to put a fake one on  To go on a date  With his brother  Oh that was his nickname  Yeah he was double dating  The only way Greg could go out  With a girl  That he liked  Was to go on a double date  To bring for her friend  Or something  Yeah but her friend was older  And he didn't have any friends  To go out with her  So he figured he'd get Peter  To put on a fake mustache  And call himself Phil Packer  Son of fudge  I bet Robert Reed 
[01:44:00]  Came up with that name  Yeah we're gonna call him  I don't know  Phil Smith  Hey how about Packer  I like that one  Well that was probably  After Sherwood  Schwartz Vito  Jacked me off  Ivan cut your cock off  Yeah I got a name  Sherwood  How about Haywood  You blow me  That's a good one  What do you think Sherwood  All right

[01:59:00]  We're having a good time today  It's the O&A virus spreading across America  We forgot to tell everyone  We went to CNBC Studios after the show yesterday  And taped the Donnie Deutsch show  Yeah, when does that premiere?  Well, our show, we don't know when it is  But I think his show premieres on January 24th  I guess Monday  Is that the 24th?  I believe so  Well, he's coming in studio Thursday to talk about the new talk show 
[01:59:30]  He's replacing John McEnroe pretty much  So it was kind of weird  We went over there across the GWB to Jersey where their studios are  And did the exact walkthrough  Willing Studios are in Jersey  Wah, wah, wah  We had to drive across the bridge, Wendy  Ugh  Jersey  Keep me out of that place  What's wrong with Jersey?  A lot of our listeners come from Jersey  I notice a lot of our listeners come from Jersey  And they'll be the first ones to say Jersey stinks 
[02:00:00]  There's some nice sections in Jersey  Yep  You've just been to the crappy areas  I understand  There are nice sections  I never go to them  Where were we yesterday?  Edgewater?  That's awesome there  Nice  But I don't like getting there  I don't like coming back from there  Montvale's really nice  It's a pain in the ass  I know a bunch of nice Jersey towns  A lot of great people come from Jersey  Oh?  Oh  Jack Nicholson  Oh, Jersey  He's from Neptune  Danny DeVito  Yeah, I see he still lives there  I'm not welcome  Yeah  He's all, you know, in Hollywood  I love that  Because we're from Long Island 
[02:00:30]  A lot of people come from Long Island  Especially in the comedy field  Yep  And you see him on interviews and stuff  Talking about how much they love Long Island  And this and that  And like, oh really?  When was the last time you were hanging out on Long Island?  Billy Crystal  And everyone else?  Billy Crystal, everyone  Romano  Colin Ferguson  Seinfeld  Colin Ferguson  Joel Rifkin  Yes  We've had a few freakazoids from Long Island  Joey Butterfuoco  Yep 
[02:01:00]  Joel Steinberg  Yeah  Berkowitz  No?  I don't know where Dave Berkowitz from  I'm gonna guess Queens  No, he was a Queens guy  Yeah  Pretty much  I don't know, whatever  So, we did the same walkthrough  We did with John McEnroe  Meeting the same people  Getting the same makeup done  Going in the same studio  But it was funny  McEnroe didn't survive  So they hosed down that studio  Oh yeah  Cleaned it out  They just hosed it down  And brought in the next talk show host  No live audience  So all the seats were gone  His  No desk like McEnroe  It didn't even resemble anything 
[02:01:30]  There was not one thing left  From McEnroe's set  The audience?  No  No, just to sit down with Don  He was pretty good  Yeah  But, um  So we're in the dressing room  And there was a couple freaky things happening, man  Who were the hot chicks in there?  Well, they wrote a book  They were really cool  Yeah  They were really hot  That one  Like, did you see her shirt?  Yeah  Of course you did  She was really skinny  But had like these  Pretty nice sized cans  That were hanging out  Out of this very low V-cut 
[02:02:00]  They're not really big  But just very shapely  Yeah  And she kept bending over  Like to get something on the table  And she just gave like a complete show  I had a feeling she wanted some action  Some action?  Yeah, something was going on with her  She was definitely flirting openly with us  Did she have a brazier on?  You know something?  If she did, it was one of those that barely covers  Yeah  Just gives the support  I love being teased  Love it, man  I think something was going on with her  She was flirting openly 
[02:02:30]  And then Anthony's laughing at me  Because I looked at the ass of the tranny  The tranny  The tranny  There was a tranny that was there  I guess going to be on the show  And he, because I never say she  It's a she, be respectful  He was walking down the hallway  Looking the most like a woman  That I guess a tranny could  Thank you for helping out your pal today  Because I'm going to be honest  Because before I knew he, she, whatever  This was  I'm like, wow  Look at that  Nice ass 
[02:03:00]  I'm talking to one of the producers  Gotta be honest  I was talking to the producers  And I'm looking  I didn't know what it was yet  Yeah  She, he is walking to get makeup  And with a low cut dress  With all backs showing  High heels  High heels  What was this young lady's name?  I don't know  But supposedly she's like one of the best  Like a lot of people can't even tell  Wasn't vanity, was it?  But when you start looking at it closely  You can tell  Yeah  You can definitely tell  But the first glance  When she, he was walking into makeup  And I was  Look at me  I'm going to try to help myself out 
[02:03:30]  I was a good 20 or 30 yards away  Uh-huh  And all of a sudden  He looks at me  He goes  You're looking at a dude's ass  I hope he's looking at a guy's ass  You guys have no idea  Anthony  I live our lives  When we're together off air  Like beavis and pun  Just goofing on each other  Biggest asses  And I'm like  No way  He's like  Yeah  And then like  That's a guy  And then the producer goes  No, that's right  That actually is a guy  Oh  I had no idea at first  So then  Then  There was another dressing room 
[02:04:00]  For the other guest  That's going to be  Appearing on our show  The one we're on  Yeah, I think it's going to air  The same  Yeah, he'll have one segment  We'll have another  Chevy Chase  Chevy Chase  You didn't meet him?  No  We were in the same room  But he  He seems to not acknowledge  Anyone around him  That he doesn't want to acknowledge  Like he  We were in  We were in hair and makeup  In that room  When they brought Chevy in 
[02:04:30]  We were done  We were walking out  And they  They bring Chevy in  And he doesn't make eye contact  With anyone  He just sits down  Starts talking  Like there's no one else in the room  Not a  You know  Not even the head  Nod like  Hey  I acknowledge  You're here  Kind of a thing  Which, you know  It's Chevy Chase  I don't care  I don't care  That he doesn't say hi  Why would I care?  I don't care  Oh  See what happens  When you hit the button  Miss Q 
[02:05:00]  Boy, that was good  Why don't you hit it?  Why don't you hit it, Jimmy?  Yeah, why don't you try  Hitting the button?  It was supposed to be 43  And I hit 44  And it was supposed to be this  I don't care  Yeah  But now it doesn't  Make any sense  Whatsoever  I remember when I first used  The instant replay  I used to do that  I insisted I had to have  One of these things  I used to do that rookie mistake  All the time  Yeah  And then I had this one  I don't care  I don't care  I honestly don't care  Don't care  Sorry  So I just messed it up  But anyway  He's doing his hair and makeup  And he's wearing the gayest pink sweater 
[02:05:30]  Yeah  I've ever seen in my life  Right  They told everybody  Guys, don't even attempt to wear fucking pink  What are you doing?  Pink  Why would you wear pink?  But he was wearing a pink sweater  Did he wear it well?  Does any guy wear pink well?  No  That's straight?  No  He walked in with a pink sweater  As pink as pink is  By the way  Not one of those  Well, it's sort of pink 
[02:06:00]  But it's kind of salmon color  No, it's pink  I think he thinks it's cool  There's nothing cool about it  There's nothing cool about Chevy Chase  He thinks like  I'm so confident in my decision making  That this whole gender identification thing  Doesn't matter to me with colors  He's just a miserable guy  He is the most miserable son of a bitch  On the face of the earth  You're doing an interview with Chevy Chase  You would think  This is going to be fun  He's a comic type guy  Comic actor  Saturday Night Live 
[02:06:30]  All those movies we all love  Fletch and Vacation  And Fletch  Yeah, Caddyshack  And you're going to have a sit down interview  With the guy  The Three Amigos  Three Amigos  That holds up well  Who's in that Steve Martin and him and who?  Martin Short  Martin Short  Yeah  So he's sitting down for this interview  And it just  We're watching  In the green room  It just turns into this  Very combative  Very, you know 
[02:07:00]  Chevy doesn't want to  He's incapable of being nice  Cordial  Humble  He's just incapable of that  So he sits there  Makes excuses for his entire career  And is just combative with everything that Donnie's asking him  Or telling him  Or facts he's bringing up  What did Donnie say?  He said, well, you haven't made a movie in a while or something like that?  Yeah, but he didn't even put it that way  Like it was  He put it in a way that wasn't  Put out there to anger Chevy 
[02:07:30]  He said something like, you know  You've  You know, the past nine years  You've kind of  Been laying low or something  You know, you haven't really  Because the guy  Guy hasn't done anything  Chevy Chase  What's he done?  And Chevy goes  I've been retired for nine years  Because I retired  What?  People don't  Actors don't retire  Actors never retire  If there's a part  They take it  No one's giving Chevy a part  So he says he's retired to raise his kids or something 
[02:08:00]  I don't even know what the  What was he doing an interview for?  Yeah  You're retired  What are you doing?  What are you plugging?  He was plugging something  Some movie he was in  But  And then  He's asking him about  Saturday Night Live  And why  Was it a good move for him  To leave Saturday Night Live  When he did  And Chevy gets all  Like, bam  He's all over Donnie  Like, hey  You know  It wasn't a career move  A lot of people think it was  It wasn't  I left because I had a girlfriend  In California  That I was deeply in love with 
[02:08:30]  And didn't want to leave her  And I would have to stay in New York  So you're pretty much saying  He left the show  Because of this chick  He goes  I didn't do a movie  Until three years after I left SNL  Can you slow down?  Because when he said that  I was absolutely amazed  Because when he was on SNL  For that year  He was the star  Okay  He was the breakout star  And then he left the program  And now he's saying  I never heard this  In past interviews  He's pretty much saying  That he left the show  Because of a girl  That would have moved to New York  Can you imagine?  Jerk  So he moved to LA 
[02:09:00]  And left Saturday Night Live  So according to him  He left the program  To go back to LA  To be with this girl  And it turned out  It never worked out  Some unsupportive pig  The guy's on one of the hottest shows  On television  And you want to stay  On the west coast  You self-centered hole  And everyone was talking  Behind his back  I guess  Oh man  This girl wasn't for him  And what have you  But he wouldn't listen  To anybody  Yeah  Can you imagine  You're on SNL  And you're like  This huge star  And you can't come back  For a second season  Because the girl you love  In California  Won't move to New York  That's amazing 
[02:09:30]  He's getting so snippy  About this situation  That the hot chicks  That wrote the book  In the dressing room  When he said that  They turned to us  One of them  Turns to us  And goes  Bitter much  Like he was just  So pissed about  This situation  Even years later  It's just  Everything that's  Happened to Chevy  Has made him  More and more bitter  That's what it seems like  And it just comes out  The guy doesn't come off  As funny at all anymore  And I know he's supposed  To have like this dry 
[02:10:00]  Very dry wit about him  And it's supposed to be  This sarcastic thing  But it does not  Come across that way  And I honestly  Don't believe it is that way  I think he's just  This bitter guy  Who likes taking jabs  At people  Has no sense of humor  Has no sense of humor  About himself  That's for sure  He'll jump on someone  And be mean  And vindictive  He's really a scumbag  And then the producers  Of the show  When Chevy's segment  Was done  And we were going in  Were saying  I hope you guys 
[02:10:30]  Are better than that  She's like  Please help me out  Because that was just  I don't think she said awful  I don't want to put  Words in her mouth  But she was like  A little more energy  That was a rough one  Or whatever  And the hot chick  Said something like  I hope Donnie  Doesn't take that interview  Out on you guys  I know  So then we're sitting down  With Donnie  Before he interviews us  For this show  It's called  The Big Idea  Starts on Monday  And we go  Hey how'd it go  With Chevy  He's like  That was a rough interview  And he goes  It's a tough one  And then he goes  Seems like he's 
[02:11:00]  Taking a few blows  To the head  Yeah  I laughed at that one  And Chevy's people  Are just always  Telling everybody  Well he's sick today  He doesn't feel well  Like that's  What if that's  Something you'd say  About grandpa  Don't go near him  So go near grandpa  Let him watch the game  He's sick today  So the point I want to make  Then the producers  Look at it  It's a point  Well not a point  But  Did you see his roast  By the way  For a point on this show  How they douched him  On his roast  Yeah  Oh he was hurt  He was really  Really  Oh  What did I miss  Oh my god  It's the best roast ever 
[02:11:30]  Damn it  They ruined him  Cause usually you  They ruined him  We've been to these roasts  And usually it's  Kind of  It's brutal  But it's fun  It's fun loving  In a weird way  And it's your friends  Roasting you  But supposedly  Like he doesn't really  Have any friends  No one likes him  So he decided  To get roasted  Sure  And these guys  Just killed him  For the money  And I heard  Al Franken  I wish I would remember  We could have asked  Al Franken  Cause you know  Al Franken's been  At SNL for so many years  He was talking about  How Chevy used to do  Coke and all that  And of course  Big baby at the end  So you know  My daughters are gonna see this 
[02:12:00]  I didn't appreciate  The drug references  And really you don't mind  Them watching their  Awful films  He said that during the roast?  At the end  He had sunglasses on  He's like  I wouldn't talk to my  It was really  He got serious about it  He killed the mood  I wish we could get  Jeff Ross  As somebody who was there  Holy jeez  He actually went that way  Yeah  Like a real baby  Typically we can't get  Jeff on the phone  But then he couldn't slam  I remember watching that roast  And his part was  You know  Heavily edited  Cause he didn't slam  Anyone back  Cause he didn't really  Have anything  I remember  It was a chopped up mess 
[02:12:30]  Didn't he say  I did it for the money  Or something like that  I don't know  He said I did it for the charity  My life's favorite charity  Or something like that  The guy was hip  Cool  And a star  For ten minutes  Back in the mid 70's  Anthony  The guy was like  The coolest thing  Who didn't tune in back then  To SNL  As a kid  You're watching this  And think  That's first of all  The coolest job ever  And he was like  The coolest cast member  Of the show  Alright he says  That he was retired  For nine years  I got  You know  His resume  Whatever you'd like 
[02:13:00]  To call these things  Oh here you go  Filmography  Well he was retired  But he still  Made the movie  Funny Money  In 2005  I guess that hasn't  Come out yet  And  Oh maybe he was  Promoting one of these movies  Maybe the karate dog  Or  The voice of Choo Choo  Ellie Parker  The movie Goose  Mariti  In  Afefeito  What  I guess he retired  Right after  Cops and Roberson  No  Because he  Went on to make  Man of the House 
[02:13:30]  Vegas Vacation  Let's not forget that  He went  Dirty Work  Okay  The One Arm Bandit  Snow Day  Ellie Parker  Pizza Pizza  Don't forget here  You got Bad Meat  Which is the story  Of an ABC morning anchor  Whatever  So  What I was  I was getting to Anthony  Then the producers  Come up to you  And they had a problem  Because it's a very dark set  And they warned us  They said you got to wear light clothes  You got to wear light clothes  And you came in with like  Kind of a light gray thing  What I wore was so light 
[02:14:00]  It was  It was probably some of the lightest stuff I have  It was gray  Corduroy  And I had a very light gray  Shirt on  Long sleeve shirt  It looked fine  Yeah  And I knew it would be fine  They wanted more color  I guess  They wanted more color on the set  So  Sorry  Then color it up a little  It's a black couch  A very dark studio  With like these  Bluish neon lighting  Around the perimeter  So  I knew it was going to show up fine 
[02:14:30]  So what I suggested  I thought you should wear  Chevy Chase's pink sweater  Which would have been  Really funny  As long as you were in the same  You know  If like  Chevy segment airs  And then we come on  Right after Chevy  And I was wearing  Chevy's pink sweater  That would have been  How funny would that be  For the people that actually got it  That would have been killer  Yeah  Yeah  Half the audience would have  Called you a fag  And the other half would have  Would have been a star  Oh what a comedic genius  Why is he wearing  Chevy's pink sweater  But yeah  We couldn't get a hold of that  And then the woman 
[02:15:00]  The producer is suggesting  That  Because Obi brought  A different shirt  He was prepared  He had a lighter shirt  That he had brought with him  To change into  Because he actually listened  And  Well they had to steam it  Yeah  They had it on a big steamer  In the drawer  I love those things  They had to steam my shirt  Because I  Like  Steam my shirt boy  Well I just  I went there  With a change of clothes  Because you know  I don't know  They want you kind of  Dressy for these stupid shows  And so I had crumpled shirts  In a little  You know  A little bag 
[02:15:30]  Yeah  Actually my book bag  And I said  Yeah I'm gonna  Just throw this shirt on  And they all panicked  Yeah  Like it's really wrinkly  I'm like so  Who cares  Get the steamer  So they're like  Go get the steamer  Da da  And they steamed it  So Obi takes his other shirt off  And leaves it in the  Dressing room  So now the producer  Starts hinting  Well whose shirt is that  And Obi goes  Oh it's mine  He goes  Well maybe that'll show up  Better than the one  You're wearing Anthony  Maybe you could put that one  And I stopped her  Deadener tracks  And go  I'm not wearing  Obi's shirt 
[02:16:00]  Going up there  Just going  Like smelling  Ooh it smells like  Obi  I wanna have this on  I like a shirt  That smells like  Another man  Yeah that'll make  For a good interview  Me just concentrating on  The smells of another man  And I started going  This will show up fine  She was wearing black  So I put my arm against  So I go  Look  It's perfect  Don't worry about it 
[02:16:30]  So then the interview went well  I guess we did about  Eight minutes  And it'll be on  Yeah  Maybe next week  I don't even know  When we find out  We'll let you know  You know I don't like  Wearing other people's clothes  I was at Bob's house  We were gonna go to the store  And I actually went up  In my apartment  To get my jacket  I don't even wanna wear  His jacket  No  Did it have little  Tear stains on it  Where it cried over  Some stupid documentary  He really is a ninny  But I don't wanna wear  Another guy's jacket  It's creepy  Yeah  Wearing other guy's stuff  No  If it's a jock or something  And you know 
[02:17:00]  Your face is cold  You know  Pop it on  But  Alright  In other show news  So that's gonna air  Donnie Deutsch  Maybe next week  CNBC  The big idea  We'll let you know  And then a couple  Other things  We're gonna be doing  Our show in Washington  Next week  That's right  Washington  We're needed in Washington  Are we gonna do  Some kind of appearance  Or anything  What?  I don't know  How about we just go down  And do the goddamn show  And not do anything else  It already ruined our Vegas trip  By having that goddamn Saturday show 
[02:17:30]  I know it was fun  It was from the porn thing  And everything  But it ruined Vegas  The timing  The timing really ruined  I was hoping for one day  Where I didn't have to get up early  And I could have stayed up  Late the night before  You should never have to get up  At 7 when you go to Vegas  No  You should be going to bed at 7  Right  And we were getting up  7 o'clock in the morning  Every morning  To do the show  And now if we go to Washington  Washington is bad enough  That we gotta go there  Because you just know the abuse  Of sitting in those meetings  Because that's why we're going  We're going to do the show  From down there  So right after the show 
[02:18:00]  We could jump into  And I was talking with Elo  And Straylo  And any other Lo  Hugo  They were talking  You know  We need to sit together  In meetings  You know  I'm talking 3-4 hours  We need to sit  And hash things out  And talk  And all I'm thinking is  3-4 hours  After the show  Sitting with these guys  Unless there's a dealer  In front of me  And a waitress  Bringing drinks  I absolutely don't want  To sit for hours  With these guys 
[02:18:30]  And the awkward part  Is like we were at the CES  Guy Chance walked up to me  And he goes  Ah I'm Chance  I go hi  And he goes  I guess you like my name  Oh I know  Because you were  Was I tooling on it  I don't remember  Yeah we don't remember  These things that we say  They take everything we say  Very seriously  Uh huh  They listen to every word  I didn't remember  I even said anything  I'm like oh no  That's a cool name  They have very thin skin  Down there  Very thin skin  That's why you gotta  Cuddle them  And pet them  And say look  We love the studio  We love everything  You guys have done for us  So now we gotta go down there  And go to meetings 
[02:19:00]  This is New York humor  Get used to it  I mean  Yeah  I mean the stuff I hear  You know  Can you lay off on blah blah  He's taking it very  Personally  Oh I'd love to know  Who's taking it personally  Blah blah  And you're gonna  You're gonna need him  To really help you out  With further projects  And stuff  And you know  He doesn't really feel like  He should  You know  That he should do anything  For you guys  Because you make fun of him  I'm like  Are you kidding  This is all supposed to be fun  It's radio  Yeah but in a business  Is that the way a business runs  Where like you go  Look so and so 
[02:19:30]  Doesn't really want to do his job  Properly  Because you made fun of him  I don't want to hear it  Right  I don't want to hear it  If I don't like a scumbag club owner  You know what  I'm gonna bomb on stage  And not do my job  Yeah  Of course not  You know how boring it is  Cut off your nose  To spite your face  Good point Ant  Good point  You know how boring  This show would be  If we spent you know  The time just talking about  How great everything is  Like oh my god  Look at this great studio  Look at the  Fantastic  The people we work with  They're so  Terrific  Oh you find the  You find the little stupid things  And you attack  Who was the one 
[02:20:00]  That didn't want to help us  I don't remember the name  That's why I didn't want to say it  I would have said it  No problem  Yeah Ben Sparks  Do we have  Hello exactly  Favorite clip  Do you want to do  The celebrity fit club finally  Yeah let's just keep talking  Oh Ben we have  Until something makes sense here  See how he looked at you  With hatred in his eyes  Those little awful glasses  Oh yeah thank you Ben  Yeah  Right  Norlins  We're gonna be  Oh  We're gonna be in Norlins  Oh do we have appearances  And meetings during that too 
[02:20:30]  That's the other  That's the last of the show news  We'll be there  Pretty much the weekend  Of Super Bowl Sunday  Right  Yeah we'll broadcast  Monday and Tuesday  Monday and Tuesday  After the Super Bowl  We'll be on Bourbon Street  In New Orleans  Yeah  You psyched for that one Eric  Shut up  You psyched to go  At least Eric's going to this one man  Go  At least Eric's gonna be  In Washington with us  Oh no  No I'm going to Washington  Oh  No you're not  You don't know  Mr. Dean  I hate to say this on the air  But I was talking to Elo  Oh no 
[02:21:00]  Last night  You're not going to Washington  Oh  That cool hotel we're staying at  With that cool bar and everything  You're not allowed to even go to Washington  I'm serious  Because they haven't figured out  How to broadcast the show from there  Are you kidding  I swear to God  Wait a minute  We'll be in Washington  But we gotta send the show here  Yeah whatever  And then back to Washington  And Eric will have to be here  To make sure  That's ridiculous  So he's not even going to Washington  Well at least in New Orleans  He's gone right  No  No  Why  No  No  Oh you poor bastard 
[02:21:30]  You're not going to cry again are you  Or is that your  Or is that your leaky eye  Really you didn't miss anything in Vegas  I mean three days of fun and gambling  Better off here in the cold  I don't know if I told you  My flight back was awful  My cinnamon roll  Wasn't as hot as I'd like it to be  I mean all kidding aside  Everything's booked now  Also  Oh I know it's great  See we ought to give him props about that  Phenomenal  We complained so badly  About that Vegas trip 
[02:22:00]  But now we're all booked  First class accommodations  Nice hotel  Everything is terrific  Nice warm soft cinnamon roll  In first class  Well funny you should mention that  Flying back from Chicago  Or as Keith Robinson would say  Chicago  With his stupid Philly accent  I was eating my lunch  And the lobster bisque  Was a bit hotter than I liked  Did you have one of the sexy stews  Blow on it to cool it off  I dipped my sandwich  I had a fine sandwich  I looked  I didn't want to 
[02:22:30]  I'm actually trying to think of a rule  Where people who are sitting in the back  There should be a curtain up  So you can't look at me  And make eye contact  I think there is  Just walk straight back  Don't look  Don't wish you were there  I don't like when they bring  The riffraff through first class  When they're seating  Don't like it at all  I think there should be separate doors  You know I don't like that  You come in and sit  And then you gotta look at them all  Walking back to the field  They touch your leather seat  Yeah  I always found that weird too  As I walk back to coach by the way  Really?  Yeah cause you see what you're missing 
[02:23:00]  Don't bump my seat either  I think you should  Yeah I think you should  I know it's wide and cushiony  I think you should enter the plane from the back  Yeah  Me being you know  Mostly in coach  I get mad  You could enjoy the shorter walk  Yeah  If they let you in right into coach  You know how good it feels  To sit there and first  Usually it's upgrades  But they don't know that  No  And I'm wearing a Sabbath shirt  Like an ass  My fat stomach  And I'm sipping a tomato juice  And Mr. Hard Worker is  Schmucking in the back  And beat it stupid  And don't look at me 
[02:23:30]  Chained to an oar  Alright  They think  They're like  Why is this moron flying first?  Yeah  Miles  Miles  Cause you travel so often  Yeah  You get the miles  And you upgrade  It's not like you're rich  And I'm meeting you guys  By the way  In New Orleans  Cause I'm doing Pittsburgh  So I'm flying from  So we can watch the Superbowl  Are you coming in  Sunday  I'm flying  In time for the Superbowl?  Yeah I land like two something  I'll be there  Oh okay  Cause we're gonna have  Like a little Superbowl party 
[02:24:00]  Yeah we're gonna have a party  Maybe in one of the  Maybe in Anthony's suite or something  Oh my suite  With the jacuzzi  Yeah we  I heard we have jacuzzi suites  It said  In the thing it said  Opie, Jim, and Anthony  Get jacuzzi  Get a jacuzzi suite  And it always  They always put  It makes it sound like  We're all in one  Ooh let's hope  Come on  You got to sit next to Opie last time  Make some O&A show soup  But then they always put  As per contract  Yeah  Cause they don't want  You know  Like we didn't want to do this 
[02:24:30]  Yes  But  Well we all know  Which one that's for  Thanks to Bob Eatman  Super agent Bob Eatman  I love him  By the way  The running bet on Eric Logan  Is what time of the day  Will he be vomiting  In Mardi Gras  There's no way  He is gonna last  A full work day  In Mardi Gras  Eric's gonna be down there  I hope so  Elo?  He's a party animal  You think?  Oh dude  Any excuse to go to a party  Are we gonna be reunited  With Tom from New Orleans?  I would love to have Tom  Come up  We could ask Ben  Join us on the balcony  He's in the office  Working today  Are we gonna have the engineers 
[02:25:00]  We had last time  That'll kick the plugs  Out of our boards  So we get kicked off the air  Here comes Ben  Cause he heard him  Where the guy can lick my head  And I can shove him  The owner of the station  Licked my scalp  And I was gonna belt him  You should've  Ben is Tom gonna be down there?  Yeah I just tried calling him  Tom has helped us out  With some arrangements  Oh he did  Oh he helped out  Yeah no no  This is  Oh that's frightening  This guy  Is he gonna get us some cocaine  Like he said last time?  No he's got the  He got us the place  And everything  Should we do the Tom  Should we do the Tom talk here? 
[02:25:30]  Or are people bored with Tom?  I'm trying to get him on the phone  You know we never wanted to go back to New Orleans  Because of Tom  I mean let's be honest  I mean the guy is  He loves us to death and stuff  But he showed up at the airport  With a huge cooler beer  He had a cooler beer  He was drinking one of those  Frozen hurricanes  Now this is the guy that  Had a big Slurpee cup  This is the guy that pretty much  Ran the radio station  That we were syndicated to  So it's no  It was no lackey  This was the guy  And he was in charge  Of picking us up  And he was in charge of us  For the entire time  We were down in New Orleans 
[02:26:00]  And he picks us up at the airport  Hammered  With a hurricane in one hand  And a rolling cooler in the other  And his first thing is like  Hey how you guys doing?  You know they let you drink  Right here in the airport  That was his first thing  He wanted us to know  You could drink in the airport  Then in the limo ride  Back to the hotel  He starts telling us  If we need anything  Pot  Cocaine  Hookers  Hookers  Anything  You just let me know  I'll get you  Jimmy you need some cocaine 
[02:26:30]  What you want  Some pot  Let me light up here  In the limousine  Yeah he was lighting up  A joint  That's right  He lights a joint  He starts blowing the smoke  In Jimmy's face  Jimmy just freaked out  This is within 20 minutes  Of landing  Yeah we don't know  This guy  Jimmy already hates the guy  I screamed  I'm like  Look you guys do what you want  People  But I screamed  I'm an addict you idiot  Don't blow  I can't take pot smoke  In my face  Right  It's like pinning down  An alcoholic  And pouring vodka  Down his throat  Exactly  I fit that bill too  By the way  Anything that removes you 
[02:27:00]  From your own  Awful meaty breasted life  You can bet I'm hooked on it  Anything that's fun  Yeah  Get it out of here  Writing  Reading  No  Prostitutes  Booze  Drugs  Yeah  So  That's when  He realized that our  Reputation isn't  What it's all  Well it's on  It's on the air  But we discussed  We don't do drugs  We're not  You know  We're not the guys  That go out there  And do drugs  All the time  It's very hard  To succeed  If you're  Yeah you can't be  This brilliant 
[02:27:30]  If you're doing drugs  All the time  Exactly  Just say no  Neither one of you  Womanizes  Neither one of you guys  Does  You're both like  Very responsible  Nice dudes  We try  We try  We try our best  Jimmy  And he gets this impression  Because of  The press  Of us  I don't know  Did he listen to the show  Did he really know  What we were all about  He thought we were  Going to come rolling  Into town  You know  And have to dispose  Of bodies  By the time  We left  Yeah  He's offering us  Drugs and booze  So then we  We set up  A broadcast  On Bourbon Street 
[02:28:00]  And they  Set us up in a room  Overlooking Bourbon Street  On the second floor  Which was killer  We had our own balcony  And all  But the broadcast area  How can you explain it  It was like  It stunk  Corner  No  I know  But the signs  It was like  Am I exaggerating  Like six by six feet  Yeah  We tried to broadcast  From the balcony itself  Which we did  A few times  But it got so out of hand  The headphones weren't  Working well enough  Where we could hear  Each other  So we couldn't hear  What the other guy  Is saying  It's so loud 
[02:28:30]  From people yelling  And then  We were getting  Pelted by beads  And not beads  Like it seems nice  If you watch the shows  On Mardi Gras  The girls flash  They throw a strand down  Or a little bunch down  I'm talking beads  That came right out of the box  Still tied in a knot  It's a bead ball  Wailing at your head  Opie got hit in the head  We're yelling  Medic  Medic  He's down  He's down  We need evac  And that's the vac guy  That works down at  XM  We call him evac  Evac  So 
[02:29:00]  And then remember  That Tom hired those engineers  That got drunk  And we were knocked off the air  They kicked the plug out  Who wasn't drunk  That's the point  I'm trying to make  Which you know  I understand  It's Mardi Gras  And all that  But you think  Someone's going to be  Responsible for this broadcast  Nobody  Tom who picked us up  He's too busy  Smoking pot  And showing us pictures  Of his naked wife  That he has on  On the internet somewhere  Which is fine  And then  So Tom is like  The operations manager  He runs the day to day  Operations of the station  Then you have the station owner 
[02:29:30]  Who is on E  With his freaking  Elvis Presley sunglasses  Remember that dude  He had a Patriots jersey on  Actually  I remember  He had the  Larry  Of course you remember that  How do you remember that  Of course he remembers it  The Patriots  You idiot  He had  Obscure reference of the day  But he had his  Larry Holmes  Slash Elvis Presley  Sunglasses on  Slash David Koresh  He was tripping on E  Decides he needs to  Lick Norton's  Bald head  Stop my head  Grabs his head  Like  Come here 
[02:30:00]  This is the freaking order  And he goes for Norton's head  I've never seen Norton  More pissed off  And he shoves  He pushed him  He shoves the owner  Of the radio station  Like get the hell off me  You need one voice  Of reason when we go  On these trips  One guy  That remains sober  And reasonable  To take care of any problems  We did not have that  Nothing  So the drunk engineers  They're like  Kicking out the plugs  In the middle of the broadcast  Everyone's drinking hurricanes  And then they're on top of us  Because we're in this little  Six by six area  Trying to broadcast the show  We had to leave the balcony 
[02:30:30]  And do it from inside  Because we couldn't hear  I'm not exaggerating  It was like six by six feet  It was me  Anthony  Norton  Ben was there  Rick was there  Steve C  No  No  So there was five of us  Then you had Tom  That had to be right on top of us  That was we're broadcasting  This is all you hear  Through the whole broadcast  Remember  That's right  He would just yell  He was just like  And then 
[02:31:00]  And then  You know  He had really bad breath  Yeah  Extremely bad  Yep  Probably the worst breath  I've ever smelled in my life  Ooh  His teeth were rotting  In front of you  They're so bad  Yep  They were atrocious  Absolutely  Really bad  It was like talking  To Staten Island  And we're trying  To do a broadcast  With this whole mess  We're trying to do a broadcast  That show  That we did  From New Orleans  Is known as  The biggest cluster F  Show we've ever done 
[02:31:30]  Yes  People still talk about it  Right  They talk about  What an awful show it was  But it was one of those  Memorable cluster F's  Right  Speaking of the devil  Tom  How you been  Hey Tom  How you been  God damn it  It's Tom  How you been Tom  Good boys  How you been  Good  How's the wife  You still with the wife  Still with the wife  We're looking forward  To seeing you  Let me tell you  Is she hot as ever  No  What  She's not as hot anymore

[02:32:30]  Well then  You must be drinking  A lot more  Hey Tom  Do you still have the office  Over there on Camp Street  Um  No  I work for Anacom  That's the difference  Oh okay  I work for Anacom  I'm amazed  They let you back in radio  But congratulations Tom  But do you know  But do you know  Who bought that station  We used to have you on  Wilk  Fareed came down  Yeah  Fareed's got the old station  And  And Elo  Was his programmer  He was the programmer  For Citadel  That's right  That's right  Now he's our boss  And he just text messaged me

[02:36:00]  For the chick  Being up there right  For the chick  Giving a BJ  Live on our show  Yeah  That isn't allowed  This chick walks around  With a t-shirt  That says free BJ's  Yeah that's what she does  During Mardi Gras  Free BJ's  And she just drops  To her knees  All week long  Or whatever  And just blows guys  Just whip it out  And she's on it  And she's on it  So we're like  Oh wow  That's kind of cool  Come on up on the balcony  Come on up on the balcony  And do it on our radio show  In front of thousands  That are looking up  Had a listener come up  And she was ready  To service him  No she did  She actually started  Servicing him  And it all broke loose 
[02:36:30]  And they wanted to  Kick us out of Mardi Gras  For that  I'm like  Yep  I'm like  Do you see what's going on  Down there in the streets  Come on  How is this bad  Unbelievable  Some fun was  Was taking beads  Yep  Tying them up  Into a tight knot  And then leaning  Over the balcony  And when people  Would walk by  With their drinks  You try to  Dive on their drink  And we had a couple  Of direct hits  It's the funniest  God damn thing  Because everyone's  Hammered  And they're walking  And to see the beads  Land in the drink  The drink just  Hit the pavement  And explode 
[02:37:00]  Yeah  And the guy looks up  And looks at  But the balcony's like  Full of hundreds of people  So they never know  Who did it  We're just laughing  Our asses off  Because there's such  A wait for booze there  Because it's so crowded  Yeah  So once you drop  Your drink  You're doomed  Oh you're screwed  Remember Ethel  Who was one of our  Old promotion people  And she always had  This blown back hair  She looked like  Frame 237  Of the Zapruder film  That was what she would do  Where are you going  I'm going to  Dilly Plaza  For a haircut  Can I ask you  About your accuracy there  Sure 
[02:37:30]  Is that an actual  Frame number  Do not know  It might be a frame number  But 237  No I know  They're all frame numbers  But I'm wondering  If you had it  I tried to pull it out  That might be accurate  But that could be completely  I think 237 isn't accurate  I'm pretty close  I believe  That joke didn't need accuracy  No I know  I'm just out of curiosity  I swear  He's just trying to see  How OCD I am  Yeah because I relate  To the whole OCD thing  Why don't you give  The number a try Opie  I thought it was 228  Why don't you give  The number a try  I thought it was 228  Ben  Like the weather guy 
[02:38:00]  Chuckling  Pointing his hog  At a low pressure system  Sorry Jimmy  That's fine  So Ethel  Oh she got whacked  We were on one balcony  Oh yeah  And somebody from  You have the street below  And a hotel on the other side  And somebody flung beads at her  Yeah  And hit it  Well threw them  And hit her right in the eye  She was crying  Yeah but before  We knew she was crying  Jimmy and I are laughing hysterically  We thought it was the funniest thing  Of course it's funny  And then once again  We have to like  This is the second time  I had to go 
[02:38:30]  There there  Pats on the back  Hugs and pats  There there  Because we felt so bad  Because she's just crying  And crying  We're going to have Kenny  With us this time though  It's nice to have a little security  I don't know why  They don't have two though  Because Mardi Gras  If you haven't been there  You literally  Can take 15 minutes  To cross the street  It is that  In the ass  Crowded  It's kind of uncomfortable  If there's a riot  Well there was a riot actually  When Snoop was there  We tried to get two guys down there  And they're like  It's Mardi Gras  What could possibly happen  I swear that's an exact quote  From Washington  I'm like  Are you insane  Have you guys been down there  It is as crazy as any 
[02:39:00]  It was intimidating  Uncomfortable  Because if anything happens  You're helpless  You're just stuck in a mob  That's it  Mob scene  Me and Oprah  Standing on one corner  Of the balcony  Just watching  We were right over  Where the bullpen was  Where they would arrest people  Yeah they set up  These bullpens  On the side streets  And it's just filled with drunks  Yeah  I saw an episode of  Cops from Mardi Gras  And the mounted police  Yeah yeah  Horses  They ride right through  That crowd man  Just plowing through people  If they have to get  To a problem spot  That's got to be  Some gig man 
[02:39:30]  Being a cop  Mardi Gras  Unbelievable  Just don't put up  With anything  Because you've got to think  The cops hate their jobs  Down there  They don't want to deal  With that crap  Not that kind of crap  Well at least that week  They probably hate their jobs  Yeah that week  It's got to be the most  Difficult job to deal with  Because you can't get  From point A to point B  The fights you see  The fights all over the place  People can just  Blindside you  And then disappear in the crowd  Well the scary part is  When you're looking  From above  It's a river of people  Like Jimmy said  You can't cross the street  Because it's literally  Just a river of people  And you try 
[02:40:00]  You walk in the street  To try to cross  Directly across  And you end up  A good block or two down  By the time you get across  Because you're just getting  Pushed as you're trying to  People tsunami  Yeah pretty much  And all of a sudden  A fight will break out  And from above  It is the scariest thing  Because it's like a tsunami  All of a sudden  The people just like  Just push everyone over  And then all of a sudden  There's a hole in the crowd  And these animals  Will just go at it  Until someone's knocked out  Then the only way  To get through  Like I said  The cops  Mounted cops  Go on horseback  And just start  Grabbing people 
[02:40:30]  Take this guy  Throw him to the side  I swore I'd never go back  I know  I said the same thing  I said the same thing  I wasn't really into it  Oh I'm not going back there  Let's go to Kevin  Real fast  Kevin  Yeah this is Kevin  Calling  I was down there  With a group of guys  And this one little  Fire plug that was with us  One of them short  Little barrel chested guys  Was hammered  And he had some old school  B-du's from Louisiana  Some fancy ones  And some drunk bitch  Came up to him  And said I want him  I want him  He told her no way  And she grabbed for him 
[02:41:00]  And he hit her so fast  And so hard  Her eyes rolled back  In her head  Before she hit the ground  And left her laying there  Bleeding on the curve  Until we took off  Yeah it's crazy down there  It's ugly  Alright thank you bro  Sorry about that  Brian in Texas  Go ahead  Yeah I've been down there  In New Orleans a few times  And it just seems like  Everybody gets loaded  In the afternoon  Yeah  I mean it's just  Doesn't matter what time  Of day it is  As long as it's past noon  They're fine  The weirdest thing  I went down to Mardi Gras  And I wasn't drinking that much  I think because I was 
[02:41:30]  Hanging with Jimmy  And I know he doesn't drink  So I was like  Not that you need help  But I was kind of like  Just kind of  Hanging out with him  Yeah  So I was getting up early  And like even 9 in the morning  I'm trying to find coffee  And stuff  And people are just  Already hammered  Or never went to sleep  It's just unbelievable  People are just  Passed out  Cold all over the place  With puke next to them  Yuck  You know that's where  They're sleeping  And they still haven't  Woken up for the day  And the hotel was  Surprisingly quiet  I don't know how  They pulled that off  Yeah  But I actually wound up  Sleeping very well there  Well you go in your room 
[02:42:00]  And they're doing something  With the windows  Because you don't hear anything  You heard nothing  I don't know how it'll be  This time with my jacuzzi  Maybe the bubbles  Will help me  This is Juliana  Hey how y'all doing today  A girl  We only get one girl  Call her a day  So make it good  Oh no  I was just wondering  You guys said  Y'all were down there  I lived there for about  Five years  Did you go to all  The good places  The hell's the good places  Oh daddy's  I don't know if y'all

[02:53:30]  That was a fun little bathroom trip.  We really just got to bring audio equipment to the bathroom because that's when Jimmy really starts confessing.  Did he say he has vivid memories of making it in his pants 60 to 70 times?  Yeah.  I don't have 70 memories, but I can remember it got so bad.  And I was probably in 6th or 7th grade.  And it was all dumps in your pants?  Wait, 6th or 7th grade now?  Yeah, what I would do is I hated using public restrooms.  Wait, wait, you were still dumping in your pants in 6th grade?  Not like I just didn't know what was happening, but I would try to hold it and sometimes a little piece would come out. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, man.  But I can remember standing under my sink.  My mother's like, I'm not doing it anymore.  And I had the water running and soap in the water, and I was scrubbing it, cleaning my own white, tighty-whities like I lived on Little House in the Prairie.  This is 1979.  Going down to the river and beating it on a rock.  I really am an ass.  With a stick.  That's awful.  Maybe some therapist can call in.  Because I used to hate going to the bathroom.  I would kind of like just kneel by my bed, and I would hold it for as long as I could just kneeling in my bed. 
[02:54:30]  Even in your house?  Oh, yeah.  I would just kneel by my bed, and I'd be kneeling like I was praying, but I wasn't praying.  I was kind of reading on the bed, and I would just kind of like zone out and hold it.  Don't ask me what that means.  I don't know.  You couldn't just walk into the bathroom in your own house?  No.  No, no.  It wasn't a fear of that.  I just, I don't know.  There was something cool about holding it.  Oh, okay.  Now it's something completely different.  Yeah, yeah.  That was a totally different scenario.  That was just a weird...  Something cool about holding it. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, it's like the way...  It was a weird zone I would go into.  Why didn't Helen help you out with this?  I don't know.  Maybe Jimmy's cape one time got a log on it, and Helen got mad.  But I...  Now, it hasn't translated into now.  What happened to you as a kid?  I need to know.  There's a stranger walking around right now with, you know...  Because I was a little blonde boy.  I'll bring you baby pictures.  I've seen.  I was a little...  Believe me.  If you like kids, I wanted to molest myself when I saw baby pictures.  Oh.  How could anybody not touch me?  A little stomach I had at Avalon when I was a boy. 
[02:55:30]  That's...  I need to know what happened.  And I wouldn't even blame whoever did it.  I deserved it.  You did.  Running around with my blonde locks.  Adorable face.  Begging for it.  You have pictures of young Jimmy on your website.  Eatabullet.com.  Yeah, yeah.  It's...  I got plugged.  It's automatic.  Eatabullet.com has a little...  Little Jimmy grows up.  So you can see little Jimmy's pictures on that website.  It truly is an unsolved mystery, though.  And as you look at his cute little pictures, just think there was probably a steaming hot 
[02:56:00]  load of crap in his pants.  Yeah.  As I force a smile because it's almost over.  Unsolved mystery.  What's in Jimmy's pants?  Who touched Jimmy as a kid?  Who touched little Jimmy Nordic?  We need your help.  Please go to the website and look at his picture.  If it looks familiar, call us.  Let us know if you're the reason he dumped in his pants for so many years. 
[02:56:30]  Unsolved mysteries.  Why did Jimmy find it so dramatic to use a bathroom, but now he likes being used as a  bathroom?  These mysteries and more must be solved with the help of our viewers.  Cute little Jimmy.  He'll be the cute little blonde boy with a little lump in the back of his pants. 
[02:57:00]  Not to be confused with the messy-haired kid with a big lump in the front of his pants.  It certainly is a mystery.  It all started with a touch somewhere.  Believe me, I'm not...  You really don't know?  No.  I'll tell you.  Please.  I suspect that, too, just because I show all the signs.  Yeah.  But I really do have no memories of it.  So it's like, I could have been...  Freaky pervert is what you are.  I was a little dirty boy.  I told you I used to act out sexually.  So I'm wondering if it's just one of those things where I was experimenting at that age 
[02:57:30]  and I'm an addict.  So anything that was weird or whatever, I was hooked on immediately.  Yeah.  I had a sexual addiction from the time I was a kid.  Wow.  It may not have been brought on by an adult.  It may have just been me and some little dumbbell exploring.  I told you, I still remember Julie.  I'm an ass freak.  And I tried to get her to sit on my little second grade lap and she didn't want to.  So I'm like, all right, well, here are some sticker bushes.  You could sit on my lap or you could sit on the sticker bushes.  And she sat in the sticker bushes.  And that set a pattern for old Jim Norton and his relationship with women. 
[02:58:00]  I lost out to sticker bushes.  And I wonder why my self-esteem is awful.  Yeah.  Janice.  I remember Janice putting her hiding in my face in the woods.  Devil's Creek and Edison.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just love the cool feeling of the cheek against my...  All right.  Let's go to Todd the trucker.  Todd.  First, I got to go to George from Philly.  He says, is this focusing?  Oh, what were we supposed to do?  Sorry, George.  The fatty show.  You're right.  What?  When were we going to do that?  I don't remember, but I remember we were supposed to do it at some point. 
[02:58:30]  George is such a stick in the mud.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll tend the rabbits.  Fatty show.  What was that again?  I don't remember.  Maybe it'll...  What?  Todd, go ahead.  Morning, boys.  Hey, Todd.  Let's go.  Hello.  Morning, Raisin Bag.  Hi, Todd.  Thanks for calling.  Hey, thanks for having me on the program.  Hey, when I was in school, we had a little girl named Diane, and she was always peeing  in her seat, but I think it was because she was hooked on the milk.  Boy, she drank milk like crazy. 
[02:59:00]  And one time, I took her milk and put it outside and hit it on her, and she called the principal  on me.  Here's what we didn't like about the story, and this is what makes at least one person  in every state want to cave your head into the rock.  Like, the fact that you told it in a childlike way, and she told the principal on me, like,  we were all going to go, oh my God, what happened?  Did you get in trouble?  You should have just said she peed her pants a lot.  Right.  And I hit her milk. 
[02:59:30]  Actually, that was an awful story, no matter how you phrased it.  Just horrid.  If she went outside and was abducted looking for her milk, and they never found her again,  that's a great story.  No, maybe, yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  But then if it follows up with something with a shallow grave involved, kind of like that.  Yeah.  Leaf covered.  And a ransom note and a little cowboy hat.  We'll try again.  Joe in Delaware.  Yeah, hey guys, how you doing?  Good.  Yeah, I'm at work, so I got to be kind of careful about how I talk about this. 
[03:00:00]  Little dance routine that'll never be finished.  That happened to me in fifth grade.  I asked the teacher to let me go, and she wouldn't let me go, and I tried to hold her.  And like 10 minutes before the end of the school day, it happened.  And if I ever see her again, I'm going to knock her reproductive organs out of a line.  Okay, car crash. 
[03:00:30]  I know.  Because you set it up like, I got to talk really quiet about this.  Why?  Were you afraid of waking the people you told your last story to?  I'm going to tell you the story whispering.  Can we dance on our wedding night?  Only if you don't go to the bathroom in your pants.  Thank you, Joaquin.  Silent J.  Let's all say hi to Richard Jenney.  Richard.  Oh, cool.  Hello, boys. 
[03:01:00]  Hey, Richard.  Hello there.  Hello, Richard.  How are you?  It's been a long time.  It certainly has.  Richard's got a HBO special.  Brand new HBO Comedy Hour called Richard Jenney, A Big Steaming Pile of Me, 10 p.m. tonight on HBO.  I haven't seen it, but I actually was talking.  I saw Colin last night, and I drove him home, and he actually said he saw it, and he said it was really good.  He did?  Yes.  Oh, that's nice.  Colin's a good judge of that.  Yes.  That's always good when another guy thinks it's funny.  I'm surprised you guys are putting me on your show. 
[03:01:30]  Why?  I thought we were finished.  Wiped out at the last time.  Richard.  You know, I think we just got off on the wrong foot.  I think there's a misconception of our relationship.  All right.  So we're all good now?  Yeah, we were funning with you that time on the air, right?  Yeah.  And then things kind of got out of hand, I think.  Well, no.  It was a misunderstanding.  Yeah, we were just kind of joking around.  Well, we kept you outside the studio for like three hours, and then we finally let you in, 
[03:02:00]  and then you were really funny.  We enjoyed your appearance, but then what happened was, ah, whatever.  It's old news.  All right.  You were agreeing with another DJ when he was trashing us, and we were very surprised  at that, just because the day before you were on our show having a lot of fun.  But you know what?  You never let me finish.  That never happened.  I never, ever said your name on the radio, ever.  All it was, was something about other guys imitating, what's his name?  I don't know if I'm allowed to say that.  Yeah, yeah.  No, you can.  Yeah, it's Howard, yeah.  You can.  Okay.  And then you guys said, you were on Talking About Us, and I was saying, I never said 
[03:02:30]  a word about you, ever.  All I said was that there were guys that were out there imitating him, and somehow it came  back that it was you, and it wasn't you.  I never mentioned you.  Ah, it's water, Asian bodies, and umbrellas under the bridge.  Oh, man.  All right.  Then I'm sorry that I took your CD and picked out the really bad sections and made sure everyone  heard.  Oh, that was awful.  He took your CD and took, like, things out of context and just was playing it, and of 
[03:03:00]  course, if you just take pieces of a comedy CD.  What else happened that day, though?  Because you were in an awful mood.  Oh, he was just a vindictive prick.  Something happened that day that he was just in a foul, horrible mood.  Yeah, his alarm clock went off.  Well, that was a CD that I made about two weeks after 9-11, which, you know, you know  how it is with material.  You know, the longer you work on it, the better it gets.  So, you know, that was, like, right out of the box, right after 9-11. 
[03:03:30]  I was like, all right, I'll send this out.  Maybe some people play it on the radio.  Maybe people get some laughs and they won't feel so bad.  No, Richard, you don't have to explain.  We know you're a funny guy.  It was just one of those things.  And, you know, I just chose to go that way with it.  Where did you see Colin?  You're not in...  I'm in New York.  I did a spot at the cellar last night.  It's Norton.  So I saw him at the cellar.  He was doing a spot.  So I just drove him home.  Sure wasn't a tough crowd reunion show.  No, it certainly wasn't.  Yeah, me, him, and Keith just riffing on each other in 10-degree weather, hoping a camera 
[03:04:00]  shows up.  Three zilches.  That's so funny, man, because when you lose your show, that's what Ant and I were doing  for two years.  I know.  Calling each other on the phone.  Calling each other up and riffing about the news, thinking, wow, this would have been funny  for a million people instead of two.  Now I can say any kind of curse word I want on this show.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what XM Satellite Radio is all about, man.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It feels weird.  I know.  Which one do you want to say?  I was thinking about...  It's such a...  Gee, I don't know.  Can I...  Is fuck okay? 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a good one to start with.  Okay, fuck.  How about cunt?  Is that all?  Oh, see, that's okay, but we have this.  Warning.  Warning.  C-word alert.  C-word alert.  Warning.  Warning.  So we usually play that before the C-word, because there's a lot of ladies out there that...  Yeah, that way the ladies can really turn up their radios, because they enjoy that word  so much.  Reminds them of when they bring home bad grades, what daddy would say.  That word is called the argument stopper.  Yep.  Oh, no, that isn't the argument stopper. 
[03:05:00]  It's the argument changer, because no matter what you were arguing about, if their super  hearing picks up that word, the argument completely changes, and you're wrong then, no matter  what you were arguing about prior.  You were instantly wrong, and you could spend the night out of the house.  Well, that's got to be fun to be able to do that.  Yeah.  Where'd you take the special?  In Orange County, California, in a place...  The O.C., as I like to call it.  The O.C.  When I'm out there.  Orange County, the O.C.  Yeah, sure.  Because after... 
[03:05:30]  This is the fifth one I've done, and then after a while, you kind of realize, nobody cares  where it's from, so why not do it near your house?  That's true.  That's a good point.  Nobody cares.  Nobody goes, boy, did that guy suck, but it was shot in Cleveland.  Where do you get your stuff from, man?  It's got to be difficult to come up with new stuff for so many specials.  I feel it from Norton a lot.  Do you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I kind of stand in the back and see what Norton's up to, because, I don't know, whatever happens 
[03:06:00]  to be going on in your mind.  You know, I was coming in here, and here's something I want to talk about.  I don't get it worked out, but, you know, they keep cutting the pay of these airline  people all the time.  Right.  You know, like the pilot now has like a 50% pay cut.  Yeah, some of these pilots can't even afford to live.  Some of the guys that, you know, fly the smaller planes, especially.  Yeah.  You keep thinking, is that really the place to cut corners?  Yeah, exactly.  Because I've seen what disgruntled postal workers can do, and they're right here on the ground. 
[03:06:30]  You really want a guy up in the cockpit with nothing left to lose.  That's very good.  Yeah, that could be something.  That could be a pilot going, folks, my pay's been cut 40%, so I think I'll stop about 40%  short of the runway.  We realize you have a choice of carriers?  What can I say?  You're fucked up.  See, that's the funniest that joke has ever been so far, because I usually have to say  screwed up.  Right.  Now I can say fucked up.  Everyone knows the F word, much funnier than the S word. 
[03:07:00]  But as Norton could tell you, the big money is in the corporate gigs.  Yes, and I'm very, very well-loved on the corporate circuit.  Are you really?  Do you do one of those?  Dude, I don't think I've ever done a corporate gig.  I mean, Christmas parties where companies come out, that's what I consider a corporate gig.  If I do a spot at Caroline's in December.  Oh, they're the best.  He's too dirty and despicable.  Yeah.  You do a lot of them, though, right?  They're the best.  I did one for Microsoft.  I got to meet Bill Gates.  Really?  Yeah.  It was some development conference or something, so I said, can I even visit Gates? 
[03:07:30]  I go, yeah, sure.  So he brought me back there.  So I talked to the guy, right?  I'm standing back there talking to the guy.  And it was, you know, you could tell he was sick because it was like a lot of rolled  up $100 bills with snot on them all over the place.  So then a couple of days go by, and I read in the paper that Bill Gates makes something  like, I don't know what the number was, but it was something like $60,000 or $70,000 an  hour every hour of the day.  And then I thought, you know, this guy talked to me for like 20 minutes.  And it would have been cheaper, like, for him to give me $10,000 and something to go fuck 
[03:08:00]  my job.  That would have been, it would have been like, here's the check, go fuck yourself.  It was cheaper than actually talking to me.  It was kind of flattering in that way.  I hear, I hear, I hear he has, he's very unhygienic, Gates.  Really?  And he has bad breath.  Yeah, I heard he's...  A lot of nerdy guys are, though.  Yeah.  Sometimes you, you know, people look not too good looking in a picture and then you meet  him in real life and they look better.  Yeah.  He's not one of those.  Yeah, I hear he's a real mess.  He is a geeky looking fucking guy.  And he has, you know, he had like Taco Bell wrappers around, like he eats, you know, 
[03:08:30]  he eats shitty food and he's really shy and awkward and he's, but he's the richest fucking,  you know, the whole time you're sitting there, you can't, you go, I'm talking to the richest  fucking guy in the world.  And you know, he's got guys with machine guns all over protecting him.  That's the other thing that I kept thinking.  Yeah.  One wrong word and there's going to be somebody in here.  How many, did you see his security details?  Because I think he's probably got like 15, 20 guys that are, he's a big kidnapping risk.  I mean, hi, a bunch of club soda, Kenny, a bunch of big retards, just annoying everyone 
[03:09:00]  at Microsoft with emails.  You don't really notice them.  I guess there must've been guys around.  He had like some guy there, you know, that guy gets, looks after him like every minute,  but I'm sure there must've been a, I'm sure there must've been a whole bunch of people  around.  Did you have to go through a security check when you went in?  No, because it was like a convention center.  So like, you know, in a big convention center, they had like these makeshift dressing rooms  in the back.  Oh, right, right, right.  Yes, and everybody has one, so he had one, and then, you know, he came, he sat down on  my computer because it was dark.  Oh, really?  He was walking on to go on, and he walked in, and he went, mind if I sit there? 
[03:09:30]  And I said, no, go ahead.  And he sat down, but he couldn't see that my computer was there.  So I thought, wow, Bill Gates' ass was just on my keyboard.  It's like blessed.  Hey, did you, was it actually a good gig, or did it suck?  It, you know, those gigs, you know, you should do them.  All you gotta do is not be dirty, and they'll pay you.  That's the main thing.  As long as you don't say anything dirty, you get paid.  Good luck.  That's the only thing.  Poor Jimmy.  Yeah, dude, it's unfortunate.  I would love to do those, but I'm just... 
[03:10:00]  He probably do a ton of them.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're right there with the cleanliness of our material.  Jim could do a corporate gig if the corporation is Screw Magazine.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's about it.  Selling butt plugs or child pornography.  I'm your man.  You got a duffel...  A duffel porn.  And they like topical, too.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, you could go in there and talk about...  Is it Prince Harry, or who is it?  Oh, yeah, Harry.  Oh, yeah, what do you think of that whole thing? 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, well, you know the guy, they said that he's going to have to watch Schindler's List now.  Yeah.  And they said if he does it again, they're going to make him watch Geely.  So, they're pissed.  Punishing him with movies.  You know, all I can say is this.  I wouldn't call myself the best dresser in the world, but you know you've made a fashion faux pas when you knock the tsunami off page one.  He had 200,000 bid, but yeah, this is horrendous.  Swastika.  Well, we got bored of the tsunami coverage.  We're like, all right, bring on the next story. 
[03:11:00]  That's how we think in America.  Yeah.  So, this is not the first airing, right?  It already...  Obviously, Eric is Colin Sawyer.  The first airing was Saturday night, and it's on again tonight at 10 p.m.  Richard Jenny, a big steaming pile of me, and all the airings upcoming are over there at hbo.com.  That's great, dude.  Cool, Richard.  Thanks, man.  Thanks for calling in, and glad we got this straightened out after so many years.  Yeah, two years.  Two years, exactly.  I was thinking, how long has it been?  And I thought, well, that was 2001, and now there's Opie and Anthony on the call. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, look at that.  Yeah, we'll have you come in when you're in New York.  I'm in.  Well, cool.  Thank you, Richard.  Thank you, guys.  See you later, man.  There he goes, Richard Jenny.  We're mending fences, Opie.  Dude, he is a really, really funny stand-up.  I know.  It was annoying me when we had our little falling out, because I'd see some of his stuff,  and I'd be pissed off if I laughed at it.  You ever get pissed that you're laughing at someone you really don't like?  It annoys the hell out of you, so.  Yeah, he's a really, really solid.  I did one gig with him.  Happens every day on this show.  Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[03:12:00]  Let me just, let's back up a little bit.  Hey, hey.  All right, you read it.  What has Eric been saying that's funny?  No, figure it out.  Wait, well, I know you like Ant.  Hey.  Just figure it out.  Well, wait a minute, I don't.  He's going to start pooping his pants again.  He's going to get these complexes.  Poor guy.  But I, but I.  A little Jimmy.  Yeah, sure.  That'll be on the message boards.  Why do I say that to Jim?  I know. 
[03:12:30]  What does that mean?  You know, it didn't sound like a joke.  No, I don't think he was joking this time.  Why does he like Jim?  Right.  It's only 50 grand.  Shut up.  You're not letting that one go.  Not at all.  But I wasn't kidding when I said that my lobster bisque was a bit harder than I appreciate  it to be.  Old friend of the show.  He's not old, but he's been hanging with us for a long time.  Frank Caliendo.  Frank, what's going on, buddy?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Hey, Frank.  What's up?  What's up, man?  Are you tired?  No.  Or is that your latest impression? 
[03:13:00]  I'm trying to think who it is.  I think it's Mr. Haney.  He's doing his Mr. Haney impression from Green Acres.  Yeah, I was going through puberty all of a sudden.  What is this about?  Hello, Mr. Douglas.  I'd like to sell you this pickup truck.  That or like one of those kids from The Simpsons that they always have.  Yeah.  Wait, which?  Yeah, which?  Something with a crackling voice.  Yeah.  So what's going on, Frank?  You know, I just figured this week at the inauguration coming up, it was a good time for some Bush. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, yeah.  I'd like to hear some Bush.  That's what America wants, guys.  I mean, did I do this?  Last time I talked to you, did I tell you about this observation I made with him that he gets to the end of a sentence and he can't figure out what word he wants to use?  Yeah, yeah, I love that.  And he's always, you know, we've all done that, but for him it's like the easiest words on earth.  He's like, he's talking about the terrorists, be like, these guys are, these guys are, these guys are bad. 
[03:14:00]  He had two choices, bad and not good, and it took him forward.  This is the guy that, this is the leader of the free world, you great observation.  Listen, that's what it's about, man.  America, I'm going to be re-enagrified this week.  And, yeah, that means that I'll continue to be president, and hopefully after this I'll get four more years. 
[03:14:30]  Maybe four more after that or not.  You're sitting at home just filling in the words, you know.  Oh, come on, please.  You're making a buffoon of yourself.  Yeah, you're just praying that he gets the word right, you know, the whole time while you're on pause with him.  It's like being in real world Tivo.  You know, and now that it just doesn't matter anymore, he's really into God, even more so. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, the Lord is our friend, man.  He built earth.  Thank God you guys left, because I really didn't have anything.  I was just hoping to get there.  Dude, that was the best one yet.  That's dead on.  That's what you need, man.  That is dead on.  That's an amazing bush.  That really is.  And then with the NFL, you know, the playoffs this week, you know, coming up, it's, you know, with Madden and stuff. 
[03:15:30]  I like when the Packers lost, you know, guys, you guys know how Madden loves Brett Favre.  Oh, of course.  And the amount of excuses that he must have been making when they lost just had to be ridiculous.  You know, like Brett Favre wants everybody to win, or Brett Favre, you know, I mean, he can't go over it.  I mean, maybe Brett Favre had tsunami relief that he wanted to do, and that's why they couldn't win.  Yeah, the two tsunami, that's an act of horror. 
[03:16:00]  Thought I was going the other way with it.  I zigged when I should have sagged.  Thanks for waiting, guys.  I was here so big.  Oh, I started to sweat, though, Frank.  It was so going to the well too many times.  Have I done the Jim Rome impression with you guys yet?  No. 
[03:16:30]  You guys know who he is, don't you?  I don't know what he sounds like, but I know who he is.  It's one of these things that, like, at a show, like, in a stand-up show, like, three people will get, but they'll buy every CD I have with him on there, you know, and they'll buy it for all their friends and everything like that, too.  He's a guy on ESPN who's just ridiculous.  Great idea.  Doing a bit with a Jim Rome impression, and five people are getting it.  That's pretty good.  No, that's right on.  I don't know what he sounds like.  Oh, really?  Like that. 
[03:17:00]  He's got these great, like, he'll pause for no reason.  He's got his own kind of words.  It'll be like, we had a call from Georgia.  Did you see George go ahead with your phone call?  Yeah, Jim, thanks for the van.  I have a take, and it's not going to suck.  We have found the weapons of mass destruction, but they're all invisible.  It's what they call Rackham.  Rackham.  It's a weird impression where people, like, if they don't know who it is, they're just sitting there, but the people who get it are wetting themselves. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah, then that's all that matters.  Now, is Robin Williams around today?  He accepted that award the other night in the Golden Globes.  Oh, of course.  What an amazing thing, you know.  Accepting awards and winning things and annoying the hell out of a large group of America.  Yeah, he's annoying to most people now, I think.  See, I still like him.  I still like him.  All right, Jim.  Every comic still likes him.  We understand.  He's royalty.  That must be appreciated so you don't burn any bridges. 
[03:18:00]  We get it.  We get it.  And he is.  No, no, no.  He's a nice guy.  He really is nice to him, yeah.  I grew up loving the speed of Robin.  You know, it's one of those things that once you find out that he's stolen jokes from everybody,  that you just are kind of like, hey, you know, I guess if I wanted to, I could just go do, you know,  all these jokes that have been done before, too.  But it's just like, there's something about that sheer speed and the way he ties things together that you're like, holy crap.  Yeah, I'm just not into the he puts a lampshade on his head and it's funny, but anyone else does it in their hack, you know. 
[03:18:30]  And he'll grab a tablecloth and make a robe out of it and start doing this Roman soliloquy and, you know, anyone else.  I'm a Roman lamphead man.  I'm a Roman lamphead man.  Now, that would be funny.  You know, when Robin finally loses his vocabulary, when he'll start to have to just describing what he is instead of knowing the actual names of people,  instead of saying centurion, I'm a Roman lamphead.  Roman lamphead.  Oh, whoa, didn't even get there. 
[03:19:00]  Come on.  What am I now?  I don't know.  I'm one of those guys from the 50s who used to do a dance.  Okay.  I've lost all reference points.  There's no specific references.  That's what he does.  I'm just describing what I am.  That is absolutely what he does.  And you'd be watching going, ha, ha, ha, this, uh, this Robin Williams guy's a genius, man.  That's the only guy that would get in his book.  I'm going to put him in my inaugurification party.  Look at me. 
[03:19:30]  I'm the president with a lamphead.  Okay.  He grabbed the golden globe and put it by his breast.  And, uh, the tip of the golden globe, he goes, thank you for this award with the little nipply thing.  And the place goes wild.  And then he goes, why, why are they laughing?  If you took a second to assess what he's saying before you just stopped laughing.  And then he goes, look, Janet Jackson.  And he made it look like he was a boob sticking up.  He was like, oh, come on, guys.  That's brilliant.  What are you talking about?  Yeah. 
[03:20:00]  Brilliant.  Come on.  The nipply thing.  The nipply thing.  He was doing what you said.  He's losing.  A golden globe or a bottle.  Come on.  It all works.  Any other can feed a child.  You know if you do it right.  You know what I'm saying?  Think about it for a second.  That is one thing.  He has to make absolutely no sense at all.  He's one comedian that's given, you know, like his, he'll say something that totally doesn't make sense.  And crowds will erupt.  You guys are totally right about that.  Where people would just look at anyone else like the deer in the headlights, he gets guffawed. 
[03:20:30]  But what is that?  Is it timing or what is the, what is it?  I, my whole take on it is that people have been trained for so long to laugh at Robin because he's such a genius.  He is so quick that if you're not laughing, you missed something and you're stupid.  So, so you feel like you have to laugh at him or you're stupid.  I get all of it, man.  Every single word.  I hang on his, uh, his, uh, his genius. 
[03:21:00]  God, he does that so well.  That's amazing.  Hey, uh, Frank, John Madden, uh, is he still around?  I mean, we got the playoffs this weekend.  Yeah, you know, and guys, I can go into that any time.  If I go into a bit that's boring, just bring me back to this, guys.  I mean.  No, no, it wasn't boring at all, but.  No, no, no, I'm not saying that now, but it will happen in a few minutes, believe me.  You know, I know, you know, I bet, you know, there you go. 
[03:21:30]  So do you have any, uh, predictions for this weekend?  Yeah, you know, I think that, you know, the team that wins the, uh, the AFC championship and the team that wins the NFC championship, those two teams will play in the Super Bowl.  Wow, that's going out on a limb.  Yeah, well, I mean, a lot of guys don't make the, you know, they don't, they don't get there and give an in-depth analysis like I do, and I think that's what, that's what makes football great, and that's what I think makes it great, and that's what makes the NFL the never figure league. 
[03:22:00]  He said that, then he called the NFL the never figure league every week, and, and, and said it like it was the first time, it was like a Robin Williams bit, you know, it's like they'd never heard it before.  Yeah.  You know, they call it, you know, they call it, you know, they call it the never figure league, and I'll be like, okay, whatever.  You know, um, a little tidbit, um, Madden lives in my neighborhood during the week, and he walks around just, look, pretty much two or three times a week, and just sits there by himself eating Chinese food. 
[03:22:30]  Hey, Frank, I got a question for you.  Are you on the same show as Bradshaw?  Yeah.  How is he to you?  Because I hear he's kind of weird with the comedians.  Uh, he's actually totally great to me.  Uh, I mean, on, every week, it's like, he'll just say, not fun of Frank, not fun, and then after the show, he'll be like, very fun of Frank.  It's kind of a gig.  He thinks he's Simon Cowell, and, and I'm on American Idol.  So, you know, that's just, that's just what the gig is. 
[03:23:00]  He's got to be the curmudgeon.  Yeah, well, I think he just is jealous, just Frank's, oh yeah, we did talk about this, because Frank's funny, and he's, and Bradshaw's one of those jocks that wants to be funny, but he was just a big, dumb Pittsburgh lug.  Honestly, and you guys will think I'm just kissing up here again.  He is, he's really hilarious, uh, you know, with, just, like, it's unbelievable how quick he is.  Like, we were at the NFC Championship dinner, and he, and, and, uh, this is last year, and, uh, he and Jimmy Johnson were battling each other, trying to make, like, Howie Long cry with these great speeches. 
[03:23:30]  So it was, you know, and then they, then Terry would just go into these, like, hilarious, he just, he just has so much, he always has, like, 6,000 things to say, and you're like, how did you think of that?  And, uh, and you're, you're going, this is not the same guy that can barely add, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  So it's, it's pretty cool.  He's very cocky.  By the way, before Jim, uh, jumped in, I was trying to set you up for a bit, you know, uh, Madden, Chinese food, I was thinking there might be some, something there, him ordering Chinese food. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah, and there is something there, uh, I mean, it's about, you know, the, the, the, I mean, you eat the Chinese food, and then, uh, two hours later, you're still hungry.  Hey, Robin Williams would do that and get a huge laugh.  You know, you got the rice over there, and then you got the, you know, the guy in a rickshaw, uh, run over there, bring you the beef, and the, I like the Monroe with the beef, and the only reason I threw a rickshaw in there, because it's somewhat racist there, and I thought, you know, you'll laugh on that. 
[03:24:30]  But, and then, and, you know, I mean, uh, Charlie Ted movie.  All right.  Oh, my God, look who just walked into the, uh, Chinese restaurant.  It's Ted Knight.  Oh, it's a virtual clown car of comedic stuff, hmm?  Yeah, well, I'm in the clown car.  I'm in the clown car.  I'm in this, uh, this, uh, this car for clowns. 
[03:25:00]  Anthony coming through the door in this Chinese restaurant is, uh, Al Pacino.  Look at Al.  I didn't know he ate at the same place John Madden did.  Yeah, hey.  Do you see Madden over there on his cell phone?  Guy looks miserable.  Hey, isn't that Opie over there?  Oh, I gotta talk to him.  Opie getting ready to tattle on John Madden for being on his cell phone.  Miserable.  What's that all about? 
[03:25:30]  Opie giving up the secrets of the stars here at the Great Wall of China Chinese restaurant.  I always have fun here.  Hey, look who just came in the door.  It's Harvey Keitel.  You dick.  We could have went another five minutes.  He doesn't do Harvey Keitel.  Everyone knows he doesn't do Harvey.  Yeah, like, and he's gagged.  How did that happen?  He doesn't have a chance to talk.  Harvey Keitel gagged. 
[03:26:00]  Oh, her.  Nice.  How do you like Madden there?  That's funny.  It did kind of sound like Madden.  Hysterical.  All right.  And Frank, awesome, man.  Great job.  Frank Caliendo.  Thanks, Frank.  Any gigs coming up, man, to plug?  Because we're on all over.  You know what?  Houston and Dallas, I'll be there the two weeks after the Super Bowl.  Houston the week after the Super Bowl and the week after that in Dallas.  The Improv? 
[03:26:30]  Yes.  And it's FrankCaliendo.com and you're linked to our website, I do believe.  Absolutely.  Hey, Frank, as we go to break, maybe Bush talking about Opie and Anthony or something.  I don't know.  Yeah, there's a couple guys on the radio, these fellas, Opie and Anthony,  that you would think I wouldn't like, but I adore them.  I think they're good. 
[03:27:00]  And you wouldn't expect this, but that Norton guy is hysterical.  Very funny.  Don't interrupt me, jackasses.  No, we're going to hang you out to dry.  I am doing a promo.  We're going to hang you out to dry.  No, we're going to cut that up for a promo.  Frank Caliendo, everyone.  Thanks, Frank.  All right, guys.  Talk to you later.  All right, peace.  Coming up next on Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton's thing.  Forget me not.  You sightless taut.

Now this looks like a job for me, so everybody just follow me, cause we need a little controversy, cause it feels so empty without me. 
[03:29:30]  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la, la.  Count America's best and brightest on the power of sports.  And I can talk now.  Opie and Anthony, I was on yesterday.  Those guys are fun.  They're back on XM, that satellite radio thing.  They love man cow, by the way.  Seven minutes before the top of the hour. 
[03:30:00]  Alright, he was being  That's sarcastic  He was being sarcastic  Alright, you throw that in  We gotta thank Brian from Fox & Friends  Giving us a little mention today  He was on our show yesterday  He did a really good job  He was a lot of fun  I think we'll have him on as a regular, hopefully  Yes  And yeah, there you go  A little assault on the media  Even that's like a little assault on the media  Any mention we can get on mainstream media  That promotes us and this radio show  Is a nice help  I think it would classify as assault on the media 
[03:30:30]  If it's any mention of our show  Without it actually being a story about us  There you go  There you go  Just a mention  But yeah, thanks for that  That's pretty cool  What happened?  Oh, we were just playing a plug  What happened?  What happened?  You know Brian from yesterday  Oh yeah, no, I did  They're coming up here  I did break this fast  Fox & Friends  He just did a quick, quick mention for us  Count America's best and brightest  On the power of sports  And  I can talk now  Obi and Anthony  I was on yesterday  Those guys are fun  They're back on XM  That satellite radio thing  They love Man Cow, by the way  Seven minutes before the top of the hour 
[03:31:00]  That was sarcastic  Yeah, thank God  Because he asked us  And we're like  What did they play a clip?  And besides, you know  I just said, look  I've never met the guy personally  But I just don't like the guy  I don't respect him at all  Because he said some real crappy stuff  About Ant and I  When we got fired  Which is fine  But he was talking about us  Like he knew us personally  And that really pissed me off  He has never met us  He's never talked to us  And he's like  I met those guys  I know those guys  And whatever he said  I mean, we got the tape somewhere  He's an ass  Would you guys ever  Is that audio of us 
[03:31:30]  In the beginning of that?  It sounded like it  So they must have got a clip  From his appearance on the show  I'm like, I know that voice  And then I'm like  Wait, I think that's my voice  Count America's best and brightest  On the power of sports  Okay, that was me  That is you  Yeah  That's pretty cool  Thanks, Eric, for that  Oh, Celebrity Fit Club  Ah, we got to focus  Focus, everybody  Focus  Like we were going to  Over an hour ago  Now, I think we should start  With Wendy the Snapple Lady 
[03:32:00]  Then we seg into Mia  Yeah  Which talks about how  You know  She's fat  But she's still beautiful  And then we'll talk to  The Sports Illustrated model  And then it'll be a nice  Cleanup of the show here  Very good  Who's Mia, by the way?  Mia is  Mia Tyler  Is Steven Tyler's fat daughter  She's a plus-size model  Is what her claim to fame is  Liv Tyler's sister  Even when Liv Tyler  Was pregnant  She didn't get up  To the size of Mia  No  And for some reason  There's some issues there  Because this girl  Just is shoving food 
[03:32:30]  Into her face  To make up for something  You think the issues  Might be that  Daddy was on the road  For most of her life  Yeah, a little daddy issue  Sure  But Liv, you know  Got over it  Sure  She's not fat  Yeah, but she didn't even know  Steven Tyler was her father  Until what?  She was 15 or something  Crazy like that  Yeah  She thought it was  Todd Rundgren  Todd Rundgren  You're kidding, right?  No  Wow  She thought Todd Rundgren  Was her father  For the longest time  And then it came out  That it was Steven  I mean, she looks just like  Steven Tyler  But she also looks like 
[03:33:00]  Todd Rundgren  Come on  No crap, man  Take a look  See at a picture  Of Todd Rundgren  Kind of could be  Liv Tyler's father also  Alright  Why does Al Roker  Have a white nose?  I'm sorry to interrupt  He has a pink nose  Wow, what is going on there?  It looks like he's wearing  A Groucho mask  Old pink nose  Might be the makeup  You know, I don't know  There was some irony yesterday  I just thought it was really funny  That it's MLK Day  And they had Al Roker swinging  From that crane yesterday  I can't believe no one else  Picked up on that  We all picked up on it 
[03:33:30]  But I mean like  Try it twice  Now I'm just not going to do it  What'd you say?  What?  Needs to  Needs to  Don't you hate to try to get a line out  And other people talk  Not that it's anyone's fault  It's a discussion here  But when you do it twice  And then you don't want to do it the third time  Now what?  I'm not saying it now  I don't know  He's right there  No, I  We'll be quiet  What would you have said  Not in joke form?  Yeah  Yeah, we won't like  Look at it as a joke  Just want to know  What the line was going to be  Alright, I'll throw it out there  Maybe makeup needs to pat a little more 
[03:34:00]  Nestle's quick on his nose  That's actually really funny  God, did I want that to bomb  Thank you, dude  I know  I have confidence in that  He did have confidence  That was a good one  It was a great line  And you know if he had no confidence in that  He would have said  Ah, thank God  I can't tell you  Bastard  How hard I was rooting for that one  I know  To pancake on the floor  I was rooting so bad  I was rooting so bad  I turned away  So he doesn't see my face  And then I had to turn around  And go  Alright, that's great  I wanted that to sound like  Steve naked 
[03:34:30]  Falling into Jell-O  Just a wet, cozy flop  Alright, Ann  Very good  Sweet-faced little flop  A sweet-faced ass  Anthony turned us all on  To this celebrity fit club  Yes  Can't get enough of it  It's on VH1  It's called  Celebrity  Club  No, it's a theme  VH1 is now doing  Where it's a celebrity reality  Or something like that  Yeah  Because it's this  And then they go into surreal life  And uh 
[03:35:00]  Man, I didn't realize  How fat the Snapple lady got  She was fat to begin with  Yeah, she was  She was never skinny  I mean  What's this show about  Really fast again  It's just basically  It's celebrities  It kind of has been celebrities  That are overweight  To various degrees  And their mission  Is to split up into two teams  And the team that loses  The most weight  Each week  Wins a small little  Cash prize, I guess  And then at the end of this  I would gather  The team that loses  The most overall  Wins 
[03:35:30]  Well, they put them  On that big scale  At the end of the show  Oh my god  That is so humiliating  The big giant scale  These celebrities  Want attention so bad  That they're willing  To do that  Get on a big  Freaking scale  Big balance scale  And then have that  Gay guy  The scales never lie  The scales never lie  It puts on that femme face  And walks away  Oh  The Wendy is  Horrid  She only did  Snapple, right?  That was all she ever did  Yeah, she was just a  Spokesperson for Snapple  And that was like what  Six, seven years ago?  I think it was even longer  Six, seven 
[03:36:00]  I think it was in the 80s  Years ago  Oh, they dumped  She was doing those  Snapple ads  Now she's  Yeah  She's even fatter  Ugh  And then our pal  Ralphie Mays  On the show  I think Ralphie's  Coming in this week  Oh, cool  We gotta talk about this show  What is he doing?  What is he doing on that show?  They agreed to allow them  To film him underwater  That is just horrific  Yeah, they all did  A swimming competition  I'm sure no one  Looks good underwater  But if you're a larger man  Yeah  I don't know, man  It was  You described it 
[03:36:30]  In the office  I'm trying to remember  What you said  It looked like  When you saw  In the old NASA films  When they were in space  In weightless environment  And they took like  A big bubble of tang  And let it loose  In the cabin  How it would just  Oscillate  And  Like stretch  And that's what his body  Looked like underwater  Like part of his  His hip  Went up  To his back  And then back down  His  One of his  Boobs went 
[03:37:00]  Like flopped down  By his crotch  And then snapped  Back up  All in this  Aqua slow motion  Kind of thing  Really  Disturbing looking  And that's what  They're looking for  Don't get the wrong  Impression  And actually believe  That this is about  Their health  Making them feel  Better about themselves  Showing people  How to lose weight  Teaching  It has nothing  To do with that  This is another  Fox show  Or VH1  Just like Fox  It's usually Fox 
[03:37:30]  I know  That it  It's a freak show  They know people  Tune in  Because we love  To watch freaks  It's a freak show  Take fat people  Like they did  In the sideshows  At the circus  And make them do things  That make you point  And go  Ha look at the fat person  Doing this  Yep  That's what it is  Now put them on a scale  The dude from the Sopranos  Gets his stress test  Because he can't do  His exercises  And right after the stress test  He's over 300 pounds  To begin with  And he's smoking the cigarette  He walks out of the place  And lights up  Lights up  What dude  Is Vinny Pistor doing it? 
[03:38:00]  No  The other dude  Bruno Schripper  Wasn't it the guy  That was gay  In the Sopranos?  Is that the one?  Vito  Vito  That's Vito  The guy that was  At the construction site  When the young kid  Pulled in early  For work  And so I'm  Hobbing the knob  Of the construction  What season is that?  Is it the fifth season?  The last season  Oh okay  I didn't see that one  And what proves your point  They have pictures  Of these people  Topless for the most part  Yep  You know  Most of them anyway  Go topless  For their profile shots  I mean the girls  Obviously wearing the bras 
[03:38:30]  Or whatever  Yeah Biz Markie  But they want to make them  Look as awful as possible  Horrid  So yeah Biz Markie  Is ridiculous  Mighty Joe Markie  So Wendy  The Snapple lady  Went under hypnosis  To try to figure out  Why she's so fat  And why she overeats  Yeah  I was laughing  So freaking hard  Because they have  They have a woman there  That she's a counselor  She's there for your  To the stars  Therapist to the stars  Yeah  And she's known  For her hypnosis 
[03:39:00]  And she got Wendy under  And they got to  The root of the problem  And here's some audio there  And this scene  Where you are now Wendy  Is it day time  Or night time  It's day time  Are you on your own  Or is anybody with you  My brother and sister  Are they out  How old are you  I am two  Tell me what's happening  We just had twins  Who's we  My parents  Your parents just had twins  What does that mean  To you at two  They just had twins  I am not the center  Of the touch  You're not the baby  Anymore  They've replaced you 
[03:39:30]  Twice  You think when you're  A two year old  What must have really  Been happening  When you were the center  Of everybody's world  And then suddenly  You're not  I'm crying about being two  This is moronic  At their next session  Marissa revisits  The subject of  Wendy's childhood  You felt empty  What have you been doing  With the emptiness  Ever since  Filling it up  With food  That's horrific 
[03:40:00]  That's horrific  Filling that fat face  She is claiming  That she's a fat pig  Because her parents  Decided to have more kids  The point she's making  Is that when they  Realized they had twins  They still weighed  Less than she did  When she came out  Fat belly achers  Shut up  She's crying  Because she didn't  Get enough attention  After the twins  Were born  And that's her excuse  And that started her  On the road to fatdom  I don't buy any of that  Crap  I don't either  Maybe if you were  Touched as a kid  Or something  But your parents  Are having 
[03:40:30]  You know  Just more kids  And that's  That's gonna affect you  Touched by a guy  In a ring ding suit  What's touching  Have to do with  Filling that fat  In the mouth of hers  The Kool-Aid guy  Broke through the wall  Put a finger in  Oh yeah  She cried into her pillow  Oh quick  Oh food people  She was teabagged  My cow chocula  I can't believe 
[03:41:00]  I'm crying  For something  When I was two  Ugh  Enough  She woke up  She had pink stuff  On her face  And she looked over  And Frankenberry  Was pulling a zipper up  Fat pig  I remember when I was two  My father  When I was eating  A yodel  Used to push  The back of my head  Down on it  He would 
[03:41:30]  He would make me  Smack the Twinkie  On my face  Before I ate it  And if I bit it  I got punished  Ugh  You whining elephant  What happened  When you were two  Well I got washed up  On the beach  And people threw water  On me  Dropped dead  Of a heart attack  Fatso  Oh god 
[03:42:00]  Yeah  And we got another  Clip from Wendy  Stop whining  Another Wendy clip  Yeah in this audio  She's now motivated  Because they got to  The root of the problem  Of course she's motivated  Thank god for this show  I think she's going to  Change her life  Let's take a listen  I can't find love in food  And I can't find love in food  And I have no interest  In looking for love in food  And I have no interest  In looking for love in food  Marissa really opened up  A whole new world for me 
[03:42:30]  And I think that  Maybe this time I got it  Now I understand for the first time  In my whole life  Where it all started from for me  And what I did  And how I crosswired information  And I understand now  This is so hard  That knowledge is power  And I really believe  That you guys have given me a gift  And empowered me  That now I can  Look 
[03:43:00]  You know  At a plate of food  And say  Am I being two years old now  Or am I being the adult  That I am  When I make this choice  And now that I know  What I'm dealing with  I got it  I got it  And I'm going to be great to me  And I'm going to be great to my team  I'm trying  How about this  Instead of looking for love in cake  Why don't you look for love  In a plate of carrots  You overindulgent slob  You can find love  If it's a bowl of celery  That's a great point 
[03:43:30]  Yeah it's got to be love in food  Why does it have to be the sweets  Yeah  I'm sure there's somebody out there  Will explain  Well of course  Shut up  No  I don't think there's any explanation there  I think that's a great point  That's a great point  Look for love in a salad  You're a mess  You're a hawking sugary beverages  You Augustus glute bodied nothing  I know where this came from now 
[03:44:00]  Isn't it the greatest  Her whining  She's whining and repeating  That psycho babble  That awful psycho babble  See I thought I was two again  Shut up  So what'd you do  I shit my pants  And continued eating  That's great  Am I two  Ben's in the studio  To make an executive decision  We have to take a break  Yes  Oh really  Damn it  Yeah  Because we were all focused
