<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with commercials for QuickPage, Lipton Iced Tea, AutoZone, and a 94 WYSP rock event featuring Jerry Cantrell.  The hosts then launched into their characteristically vulgar and sexually explicit banter, punctuated by crude jokes and profanity.  A listener from Boston, either Ryan or Brian, experienced a significant delay, leading to a humorous miscommunication with the hosts as he responded to an already-passed segment.

Anthony subsequently detailed his home d√©cor choices in graphic and homophobic terms, sparking a comical debate with Opie about bed linens, including bed skirts, duvets, and sheets, and extending to other furnishings and interior design elements.

The show then transitioned to a backstage interview at Ozzfest with Jimmy Norton, Shavo Odadjian (System of a Down), and Kelly Osbourne.  The conversation covered music preferences (Black Sabbath versus Led Zeppelin), the Osbourne family's reality TV show, and Kelly's experiences with fame, all interwoven with the hosts' and Norton's vulgar humor and sexually charged comments.  Further discussion of the Osbourne family and their show, interspersed with explicit jokes, concluded this segment.  Additional commercials followed.

The Kelly Osbourne interview continued, delving into the filming of her reality show, including camera placement in her bedroom,  her interactions with fans (including an anecdote about an unattractive fan inappropriately touching her), and the repetitive questions she and her brother faced about Ozzy Osbourne.  She also discussed high school, her lack of future plans at 17, an embarrassing moment involving her brother almost pulling down her pants, her relationship with Elijah Wood, and her general dislike of famous people.

A highly confrontational and offensive call from Irene followed.  Irene vehemently criticized the show's content, accusing the hosts of being politically incorrect and degrading women, leading to a heated exchange filled with insults, accusations of racism and sexism, and a personal anecdote from Irene about her boyfriend's death.  The argument escalated into a vulgar and personal attack from both sides before abruptly ending.

More commercials and banter between Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, referencing the call with Irene and OzzFest events, filled the next segment.  Further advertisements and promotional announcements followed.

The show then shifted to a discussion of CB radio slang and anecdotes, with Anthony recounting a disastrous date set up via CB radio, using the handle "Diamond Dust," which involved a woman ("Dreamweaver") far larger than he anticipated. This was followed by a series of sponsor calls for Phillies baseball, Gum Out, FreeCreditReport.com, Ultracarb, LoJack, Guitar Center, a tattoo parlor, Sobe, and Stacker 2, along with an advertisement for a car credit event.  The conversation continued with a discussion of a 97-year-old man allegedly using Viagra and its consequences, followed by Opie's story about his father's erectile dysfunction treatment.

The show featured a bizarre and increasingly erratic phone call with Andrew Dice Clay, seemingly experiencing a nervous breakdown.  The call involved Happy Face (Dice's intermediary) and Barry Williams ("Greg Brady"), who attempted to make Dice a television offer amidst Dice's rambling, nonsensical pronouncements referencing various historical events and disasters. Christopher Titus, a guest on the show, reacted with amusement and concern, describing the call as a great improv radio bit.

This Andrew Dice Clay segment was interspersed with advertisements for various products and services, including a "WOW" contest, beer, diamonds, a hotel, mattresses, a bicycle sale, and a credit event.  A subsequent interview with Phil Anselmo (Pantera) covered his life, career, substance abuse, and near-death experiences, peppered with Anselmo's cursing and the hosts' riffing.


The show included a segment focusing on the supposed rivalry between Tom Brokaw and Dan Rather, specifically their competitive desire to report from Afghanistan.  Many commercials aired, including for Consolidated Credit Counseling Services, Geico, Best Buy, Payroll Data, Philadelphia Phillies games (with a Spongebob Squarepants appearance), Copa Banana restaurants, Budweiser, VoiceStream Wireless, and LoJack, among others.  Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine performed a cover of an explicit Nine Inch Nails song.  The hosts engaged in exaggerated, profane commentary about Brokaw and Rather, using violent imagery and war movie references.  A caller confessed to stealing numerous items from a Niagara Falls hotel, including kidnapping a maid, leading to a surreal conversation with a hotel representative. The show ended with a song about a childhood friend named Ed containing explicit lyrics.

[00:03:00]  94 WYSP, Philadelphia.  This is Oopie and Anthony.  The real damn thing.  Pure.  Awful.  Nice.  Where the bitches at?  Where the bitches at?  Did he give you a mouthful in the street, did he?  Painful.  Nice.  Wow.  Where the bitches at?  Nice.  Where the bitches at?  Nice.  Talking about.  Mule.  Opie and Amber.  On 94 WYSP.  We'll be right back. 
[00:03:30]  This is Opie and Anthony on 94 WYSP.  I want to take a dedicated like this.  I know you're out there.  I can feel you now.  I know that you're afraid.  You're afraid of us.  You're afraid of change. 
[00:04:00]  We're not what you think.  I'm going to hang up this phone.  And then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see.  A world without rules and controls.  Without borders or boundaries.  A world where anything is possible.  This is the Opie and Anthony's shallow.  Have my signal.  Unleash hell.  Welcome to the bottomless pit of ignorance.  Here's a clip. 
[00:04:30]  Jesus Christ, this is going to stop.  Is that mango or papaya?  That'll get our ratings up.  How are we supposed to win in the ratings?  If we can't talk about blue and our pleasure.  Suck it up.  Walk it off, Zeke.  I love camel toe.  The shaving for America.  I got to see that ass.  I would definitely be willing to have sex with you if we both already had AIDS.  Opie says it isn't bad. 
[00:05:00]  Rude, disgusting, self-centered pieces of trash.  You guys suck.  Blah, blah, blah.  Thank God we get back to the anal.  Oh, okay, terrific.  Insert joke here.  The handy's great in a pinch.  Did I just hear that?  Hello.  Hello.  Pull your pants down.  Ew.  You got bad eyes.  You're the Opie and Anthony's shallow.  Number three. 
[00:05:30]  You pulled up your sister.  You're all burning.  It has to amy.  Alcohol equals great radio.  Opie and Anthony.  Are you not entertained?  Jane.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Making the First Amendment seem like a bad idea.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  We got someone in Boston checking in. 
[00:06:00]  Ryan, what's up?  Ryan.  Oh, man.  I need this guy in the air.  Ryan.  Ryan, you there?  Ryan or Brian or...  This guy, you.  Hello?  Yeah.  What's your name, bro?  Ha, you just said hello, you dick.  This thing is way off, huh?  Why?  Hey, dude, dude, dude.  Oh, my God.  He's listening to the radio.  Dude, dude.  We're not talking about sticker stops anymore.  You're live on the air.  What an ass.  Hey, stupid.  Turn the radio off. 
[00:06:30]  This, you know, you know how annoying this is, but it intrigues me every time.  All right.  I got to finish it.  All right.  See where it goes.  Well, we're going to say hi to him in a second.  Yeah, listen.  Let's listen.  We're on, like, a two-minute delay or something.  Let's listen.  All right.  To the guy that has the phone to his ear and he's listening to the radio at the same  time, we are talking to you now.  I want to hear him answer it.  I want to hear him answer it when we go to the phone.  All right.  He's listening.  Because then he'll hear his name and go, huh?  He's going to answer himself. 
[00:07:00]  Ryan?  Not yet.  Here he goes.  Come on.  Wow, what a delay in Boston, huh?  They don't trust us at all anymore, Boston.  I thought the delay in New York was bad.  He'll hear his name soon.  And then he'll start answering the radio like an idiot.  Oh, here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Hey, the fuck? 
[00:07:30]  Listen.  All right.  There's the music back.  Now you took the call.  You got someone in Boston checking in.  Ryan, what's up?  What's up?  What's up?  You idiot.  What a dick bag.  Yeah.  What an ass.  Yeah.  What a dick.  Yeah.  Ryan.  Shut up.  How are you?  Hello. 
[00:08:00]  What?  What an idiot you are, dude.  I can't hear you on my phone.  My phone isn't the greatest phone in the world.  Well, jackass, Ryan, don't you realize that...  Hey, stupid.  I have the radio off.  Don't fucking do it.  Holy fool.  That is great.  Is he still there?  Ryan.  Ryan.  I know you're talking to me.  My phone stinks. 
[00:08:30]  Hello.  He's still talking to the radio.  Yeah.  Ryan.  Hello.  Ryan.  Ryan.  Ryan.  On the phone, stupid.  On the phone, you idiot.  Who talks to their radio?  No one talks to their radio.  You're on the phone with them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You.  I love it.  Listen, he's talking to the radio. 
[00:09:00]  Ryan.  Oh, my God.  He's still...  It's going to go around again.  I know.  When we talk to him again, will he be smart enough to hear himself and go, hey, me.  That's me.  Wait a minute.  He's talking to me, too.  Hey, Ryan.  Where's the radio?  Yeah.  There's where it happened.  Hey, Ryan.  Ryan. 
[00:09:30]  Shut up.  How are you?  Ryan.  Shut up.  What a medium you are.  What a medium you are.  Uh...  Ryan.  Well, but I'm jackass.  Ryan, don't you realize that...  Now he's laughing at himself.  Hey, uh...  Hey, Ryan.  Ryan.  What a bunch of idiots. 
[00:10:00]  What did he say?  What did he say?  He goes, oh, funny.  What a bunch of idiots.  Are you still there?  Ryan.  Ryan.  He's still answering to the radio.  He's answering to the radio.  You are the biggest tool we've ever had on the air.  Brian.  Brian.  Hello.  Yes, stupid.  Answer us.  Ryan.  On the phone.  Mike.  Hey, Ryan.  Brian.  I can't hear you from the phone.  Listen, I can't hear you through the phone. 
[00:10:30]  Why?  Just want to tell you, the Celtics are going to spank the Knicks and Jason Kidd is a life  beater.  Oh, what a dope...  What a moron.  Knicks?  They're not even playing the Knicks.  That's classic, though.  That is classic.  What a complete ass.  There you go, Boston.  Looking good.  Love you, Kev. 
[00:11:00]  Love you, Rick.  You're so excited to be back on the radio.  I know.  Look at you.  I was walking around with stupid Bob Kelly buying things.  This is how I knew I had to get back on.  We're in a store, Delphinium, where there's nothing but homosexuals.  And Bob goes, dude, have you used that candle holder I bought you?  And I'm like, I really need to get back on the radio.  Oh, my God.  I really...  Take it out.  Let me just put it in my mouth and get it all done.  Because he bought me a little thing.  A little thing for my apartment where you hold five little tea candles.  Wait, wait.  Five little tea candles.  And what is it? 
[00:11:30]  A little...  It's shaped like this.  What is it made out of?  It's made out of wood.  It's made of wood.  One, two, three, four, five.  And it's like...  I've seen these.  Yeah.  And is it some kind of polished, colored wood?  Black polished wood.  Yes.  Probably about a foot long and two inches high.  Sure it is.  Five little...  Three simple words.  I am gay.  Love you, Ben.  Love you.  Oh, the thing is...  And there was...  Yes.  I agree.  I've seen those.  And there's five little candles.  And Bob's like, if you use those candle things, I bought you. 
[00:12:00]  And I'm like, I just...  This is disgusting.  Have you been to Bed, Bath, and Beyond yet for your place?  Not only do I do a bit in my act about that.  I was kidding.  I was kidding.  No, I'm kidding.  Yes, I do.  I have.  I spent a little over $1,000 in there in two days.  I could just picture you wheeling that Bed, Bath, and Beyond cart through the aisle.  I need a fluffy little pillow.  Throw it in the cart.  And you haven't seen Jim Norton on stage in the last eight months?  He does a ten-minute bid on that.  You don't know what a faggot I've turned into with shopping. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, I swear to God, I almost bought a sconce from an urban house.  I was looking for sconces.  I don't even know.  I don't even know what a sconce is.  It sounds like...  What is it?  It sounds like the scab an HIV-positive person gets on their yam bag.  That's what it sounds like.  Yeah.  But it's not.  It's a little thing that you put on your wall.  A wall sconce.  Of course, a wall sconce.  And what goes in there?  A little candle?  A little candle.  A little tea candle.  I like candles.  I like that vibe. 
[00:13:00]  A wall sconce.  What do you want it to look like?  Dracula's house?  Got ourselves a pretty little faggot.  Put a torch in there.  No, I didn't say I needed candelabras.  I want little sconces.  Is it wrought iron?  Is it made of wrought iron?  You know what?  I really should be bludgeoned to death like Shondra Levy in a park.  Because I did buy...  And my little leotard should be found tied up next to me.  With some yummy liquid in there.  Yes, but no bone stuff.  So they believe it was used to be tied.  I think they found some juices. 
[00:13:30]  I do have wrought iron candle holders.  You have wrought iron candle holders.  They're the floor type.  Walk this way.  You are making this place up.  He is so preoccupied with decorating his apartment.  It's amazing.  So I used to live.  But it's amazing.  I don't see you as that kind of guy with the decoration.  Did you get a dust ruffle for your bed?  What?  Do you have a dust ruffle?  A bed skirt.  It's a dust ruffle.  You got a bed skirt.  You got a bed skirt?  I certainly did. 
[00:14:00]  Look at his face.  I certainly did.  He's very angry.  You need a bed skirt.  I love macho men that are being faggy.  I'm not macho.  They have to sell it to you like, I certainly did.  I certainly did because I'm a man.  Like, that's a normal thing.  And why don't you have one?  It is a normal thing.  A bed skirt?  Yeah, dude.  You need a bed skirt.  Or else the dust collects under the bed.  By the way, hanging out with my family the last week.  They love the Dice bit.  Dice home decorating.  Home decorating. 
[00:14:30]  Love.  One of their favorite bits lately.  Keith Robinson almost punched me in the face for saying to him that I have to go, let's  go down.  I got to get a bed skirt.  We were on the road.  I thought it was when you called him a nigger.  What?  He did?  I have never, ever said that when he's been in the room.  Ever.  Oh, my God.  No, we were on the, we were on the, uh, I didn't say that, Keith.  We were on the, it was awful.  Oh, come on.  Love you, Anthony.  Horrible.  Let me keep the comfort.  I was on the, uh, oh, my. 
[00:15:00]  Well, let's get back to this bed skirt before we take a break.  We were on the road, and I said, I got to get a bed skirt, and he told me.  Why do you need a bed skirt?  You just get a, you just get a, you just get a, a comforter that kind of hangs all the  way to the floor.  No.  I'll touch on your hair until you cry.  It was, the, the bed is high, and I need a skirt, it just makes it look good, and chicks  like it.  Because you know why?  The legs that hold your bed up, it's unsightly when you walk into the room, because it's so  high up, and the mattress is so big.  Yes?  Do you have a bed skirt?  I call it a dust ruffle.  Aw, that always sounds cute.  It goes, it fits, and it matches, uh, you know, the rest of the motif. 
[00:15:30]  What do you have, manly man?  A bunch of go-bots on the bottom of your bed?  What do you have, uh, on your bed?  I, uh, I have one of these things.  I just didn't know what it was called.  Ah, see?  But I didn't buy it.  What'd you think it was?  Oh, like I went out and got it.  The only one that went out and bought it was you.  So what?  What am I supposed to do?  Shoplift it?  I bought it.  So what?  I'm a man.  I don't need to...  Opie goes with the blankie.  I put my blankie...  I threw mine in the garbage, because of the stupid, uh, double tape they give you there, 
[00:16:00]  or whatever, to stick it on.  Double tape?  Double tape.  What kind of cheap stuff are you buying, Opie?  I don't know what it is, but...  Double tape?  It doesn't stay, uh, stuck to the bottom of the bed, so I threw the whole thing out.  No, it's elastic, and it goes over, like, the box spring.  Oh, I got...  And then your mattress...  Boy, what a surprise.  We got the cheap one.  Yeah, what'd you do?  Staple it to the side of the bed?  It's supposed to go under the entire mattress.  I bet you bought regular sheets, and they only come halfway down your mattress, too.  Did you buy deep pocket sheets?  I don't know. 
[00:16:30]  You need the deep pocket sheets for the...  What the hell is a deep pocket sheet?  Well, if you get a good mattress that is like a foot or a foot and a half tall, the regular  sheets that are only about eight inches, uh, it doesn't fit down the sides, Opie.  Dude, I...  So you need the deep pockets.  It's at least a foot...  It's like sleeping on Voss below the waist, about a foot high.  Just a foot high.  Opie, what's the thread count on your sheets?  I don't know.  Mine is, I got the sateens.  Oh, you got the sateens?  Yes.  What the hell happened?  You gotta have a high thread count.  You do.  Or else it's cheap sheets.  Yeah.  Cheap sheets are bad.  They're bad. 
[00:17:00]  And I had to buy two duvets.  What?  All right, now...  All right.  All right, now you've lost it.  I have no idea what a duvet is.  I'll admit you do.  I'll admit I know what a bed skirt is.  I don't know what a scounce is and what...  A sconce, not a scounce.  I'm not shopping.  It's French for a...  A scounce is...  I don't enjoy playing Caroline's this weekend, by the way.  Oh, nice.  What is a duvet that you needed two of?  I'll tell you what I have.  I have my bed, I have a sheet, and a nice big fluffy comforter.  That's all.  Duvet is a comforter cover, so you don't have to wash your stupid comforter. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, I just called it a comforter cover.  Well, that's because, again...  I have a duvet.  I'm classy.  Of course you do.  I'm benched for a duvet.  All right, I got a duvet, too.  Doesn't matter what you call it.  See, we all...  I didn't even know I had a duvet.  I didn't know what it was called.  You can call...  Love you, Mary.  Love you, Earl.  You can call it whatever you want.  It doesn't matter.  A duvet.  Yeah, well, I'm calling it a V, but it's really a C, and I'm putting it in my mouth.  It doesn't matter what you call it.  I have a duvet.  Yes, I do.  And you're proud.  And I have a stain on it. 
[00:18:00]  It looks like somebody took a melted marshmallow and food on my duvet.  I had to buy another one, because I'm like...  You put a C-stain on your duvet.  I didn't put it there.  It just happened to land there.  Sorry, I can't aim.  Do you have anything satin?  Do you have satin sheets?  No, I would have gotten them.  I don't know why I didn't.  It's too expensive, man.  You know what?  With a comforter...  Too slippery.  If you have a comforter that is also satin and satin sheets, the second it is not equal 
[00:18:30]  on either side, like the second there's one inch more comforter hanging over the bed  than on the other side, this weird physics lesson happens, and the entire comforter will  waterfall off your bed.  It's amazing.  You have satin?  If you...  Yeah, but we barely use them anymore, because I got a new duvet.  Must be nice on your little red-burned skin.  Ah, you know, you just kind of get up a little and let your yam bag rub on it.  Feels good.  Feels like you're wearing giant panties.  It's wonderful.  Without that good smell. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, you mean on your thing.  I wasn't...  Yeah, okay.  Put them over the old head.  I love you, Jimmy.  I love you, Big Kev.  Oh, my.  That's a good point.  You're right.  No, you're right.  You're right.  I agree.  You're right.  Okay, sir.  All right.  Well, that was a good fag hour, wasn't it?  We sure fagged it up that hour, Jimmy.  Yeah, we got to take a break.  Jimmy Duvet.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Stay there.  Hello, America.  Opie and Anthony want you to vote for boobs.

[00:29:00]  I just want to fade away the shake-up.  It's the Retard of Laverne.  Why'd you leave the shelter on the table?  Here you go.  Create another stable.  You wanted to.  Grab your brush and put a little makeup.  You wanted to.  I just want to fade away the shake-up.  You wanted to.  Why'd you leave the shelter on the table?  You wanted to.  Oh, I don't think you trust in my self-righteous suicide.  I cry when angels deserve to die. 
[00:29:30]  Hit it!  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show backstage at OzFest.  I thought it was going to be the Anthony and Ben show for a second.  You came running in at the last minute.  Let me tell you something.  A guy from Apex Theory holding up the whole bathroom line.  He was taking the biggest and most massive dump I've ever heard live.  Was it Dave?  I don't know who it was.  Celebrity dump.  It should be Dave, though.  Everyone was really pissed off at this guy because he would not get out of the stall.  And the noise is coming out of this stall from the dude from Apex Theory. 
[00:30:00]  So we made it back just in time.  Oh, damn.  Jimmy Norton is here.  He's finally back.  Where were you now?  Stalking.  No, you were stalking Kelly Osbourne.  Not at all.  No, I'm not stalking.  I had to whiz.  I was right after you to go to the bathroom.  We got Shavo in front of us.  He's the biggest Ozzy fan in the world.  Hello, sir.  It's a pleasure here.  Bring it.  Are you a fan of System of a Down or what?  They did a phenomenal Sabbath cover.  I forget what song you covered.  It was on on Liberty and Black.  It was phenomenal.  Snowblind. 
[00:30:30]  Hey, look at that.  See, everything goes back to Ozzy or Black Sabbath with this guy.  It should.  Well, that's for all rock bands.  Oh, no.  Thank you.  He's right.  He's teaming up on us today.  No, but the root of metal came from Sabbath.  I mean, that's just a fact.  It's not an opinion.  Of course.  Can I ask you an honest question?  Look at you with some validation.  Honest question.  I only want honest questions from this interview.  Okay.  Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath?  Different.  Led Zeppelin is that it's a, no, I'm a huge Zeppelin freak, but Zeppelin and Sabbath did different  things to music. 
[00:31:00]  Right.  Sabbath brought in that heavy.  No, I know, but you personally.  Personally?  I love them both.  I don't have a favorite band.  You know something?  No, but I don't have a favorite band because I love music.  I love art.  I can't say I have a favorite painting.  It's like, what's better, green or blue?  You can't say that.  But Jimmy, on the other hand, will say Sabbath all the time.  I like Zeppelin.  You're talking apples and oranges.  Yeah, we are.  No, because Zeppelin had such more, I guess, textures in them.  Yeah, more of a blues thing.  Of course, but they came later, too. 
[00:31:30]  I mean, I only was a very blues guitarist.  I know.  He was very, very blues.  See, we argue this point all the time on our radio show.  I started, one of the first bands I got into was Black Sabbath, but then when I discovered  Zeppelin at an early age, there was no turning back.  And I still appreciate Sabbath and I like Ozzy, but I think Zeppelin blows them away.  No, they don't.  All right, but it's not about, it's about a shadow.  They don't either.  Ask Kelly that.  Bill Ward, very underrated.  Very underrated.  How do you think?  Thank you.  So, how are you doing, bro?  I'm good, man. 
[00:32:00]  I woke up a little while ago, came here.  Did you?  What time do you wake up?  2.30.  Did you have a crazy night?  No, I just didn't sleep until like 6.  I just, I'm still jet lagged.  Okay.  I hope it's on.  Is it on?  Yeah.  Do I have to stick my mouth out like this?  Okay.  Do you do the stay up late, wake up late, rock star thing?  It's just tour schedule.  I can't sleep when I'm on tour that, you know, like too early.  Why is that?  It can't be nerves.  No, it's not nerves.  No, it's just that schedule that I'm on when I'm on tour.  Yeah.  You know?  You want to be fresh for the stage too.  I'm also a night person and I create at night and I have a guitar and stuff in my room 
[00:32:30]  and I, and the only time I can write or play is when I'm, when the sun is down and everyone  else is asleep and I know that I'm like one of the only ones up, so.  I am such an ass, man.  At River Rave, you guys were there a couple of years back and I wasn't familiar with the  band at that point.  All good.  You know?  And now, you know, I love the band and I'm one of those guys that's like, yeah, I saw  them, man.  I saw, I don't remember it. 
[00:33:00]  I don't remember any songs.  I don't remember anything.  It's one of those instances where I saw you guys, but I'm so psyched to see you tonight.  Well, we're excited to play.  I mean, if everything goes well, we're going to, you know, give you our best.  Hell yeah.  You guys got a real unique sound, man.  I mean, the vocals that you guys have, it, it, it almost sounds operatic at points.  See, um, when we started, we've been like a band for about nine years now.  I mean, this is when we're sort of overnight success. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  Another one.  Everyone's like, you know, how'd you guys like, how'd you blow up?  Well, we didn't blow up, dude.  We just played and kept on playing and playing and playing until we're here, but we're not  stopping.  We still have the same mentality we had about eight years ago, nine years ago, where we're just  going to keep on pushing no matter where we are.  Yeah.  If we're playing at 13 people or if we're playing to 13,000 or a hundred, you know, a thousand.  So.  But thank God it's not 13 people anymore.  I sometimes miss that.  Do you?  Yeah.  You miss the bone gigs?  Because it was cool to like, know that no one knows you when you walk outside. 
[00:34:00]  It was kind of a cool thing.  Right.  Yeah.  You drank all your pay money.  Whatever I wanted to do, I could do and like, not really be looked at and stared at  and, you know, kind of talked about.  Now I can fart and someone will be like, oh, dude, the guy from Citizen farted.  That's fucked.  Yeah, but there's also the other perks like, oh, look at the dude from Citizen getting  a Hummer from the 17 year old.  You know, it kind of.  That won't happen.  Not with us.  No.  18 years.  Do we?  Yeah.  It's got to be legal.  Do we got a microphone for Kelly?  Yes, we do.  Hello, Kelly.  We got Kelly Osborne joining the interview. 
[00:34:30]  Hi, sweetie.  The adorable Kelly Osborne.  I remember her.  She was very young when I met her.  I know.  I was really.  A lot.  Yeah.  You were very.  Oh, yeah.  She's an old maid now.  No, but she's still a kid.  No, but she looks growing up and she's older.  She's turning into a woman.  You meant like a little baby?  No, like I was probably about eight the first time I ever met them.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, you must have met a lot of people when you were young.  So it's hard to see her with makeup on, is it?  You know.  You've got a little lipstick on.  Look at that.  Looking adorable.  I am a female.  Cute.  Right.  Cute. 
[00:35:00]  You must have met some people, though, when you were younger.  Yeah.  With dad bringing people over the house?  No, we never really.  I met most of the crazy people on the road more than at the house.  My mom wouldn't have them at the house.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow.  That's how my mom lived.  You toured a lot, though.  Didn't they bring you around a lot of times during the tours?  Yeah, a lot of times.  So you met a lot of people backstage?  Yeah.  Was that kind of like, you know, you probably...  Don't really pay any attention to it.  Yeah, like a lot of people, that would have really psyched them up, but you were probably  just like, eh, that's some of my dad's dopey friends. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah?  Any, any, uh...  You've blown up because of the TV show.  I mean, everybody knows who you are.  That's got to be something.  Like, no one really knew who you were before then.  It's like, I don't really pay any attention to it because it's like, I see it as everyone  has their 15 minutes.  This is just my 15 minutes and it's not going to last forever, so I don't really care.  Yeah, but it seems to be lasting a little longer than 15 minutes.  I mean, you guys are everywhere.  Everywhere you look, man, there's TV Guide and all the magazines and stuff and it's... 
[00:36:00]  You've let cameras into your home and now you've kind of opened it up and it's had to  change your life a bit.  It has, a lot.  For the better?  Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of bad stuff and there's a lot of good stuff, but with anything  you can find that.  Do you like the attention, though?  Most of the time, I don't.  No?  No.  You're kind of a private...  You really don't like the attention at all?  I don't like people coming up to me and telling me that they like me.  Why?  Because it's very uncomfortable.  Like, what are you supposed to say to that? 
[00:36:30]  You just say, uh, thank you.  You smile and say, thank you.  All vouch for that one, though.  Yeah, it's very uncomfortable.  You don't know these people and it...  Like, you're very nice, but you just...  It's very...  Somebody telling you that they love you and that they really like you.  It's very weird.  I wouldn't know.  I've never heard that.  Not even from your mom?  No.  I feel sorry for you.  That's Jim Norton, who, by the way...  is the hugest fan of your father.  This guy is, like, psycho-obsessed.  He's borderline stalker.  He'll shake his head no, but he is.  He would have sex with him. 
[00:37:00]  She met Ozzy.  She's the only person...  What do you do with everybody, you idiot?  I like to ask.  I like to see him getting the respect he deserves from the other bands.  Is that bad?  No, not at all.  It's not illogical.  Now, who did you grow up listening to?  It couldn't have been your dad.  I didn't...  I was...  See, I would never watch TV or...  Yeah.  Say system went down.  System went down.  System went down all the time.  No.  But I did...  I never really watched TV or listened to the radio.  I was just out doing things. 
[00:37:30]  I never...  Me and my brother, we never really watched TV or listened to the radio.  Your brother comes off as a little weird on that TV show.  I gotta tell you.  He comes off as a little wacky.  Is he a cool kid?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No.  I was about to say something really mean to you then.  Why?  He's my brother.  You can't talk smack about him to me.  I'm not...  I said how he comes off.  How does he come off?  Especially on the opening couple of episodes with the army.  That means that you think he is weird.  No, no.  No, but seriously.  For real.  What do you expect him to be like?  After a while, I noticed that he's a normal...  What do you expect him to be like? 
[00:38:00]  I'm not kidding.  What do I expect him to be like?  I didn't know.  But the way it was presented with the army thing and the bayonet and the cat...  He's a boy.  You used to do that stuff.  Wait, wait.  Talk it in the mic.  I guarantee you see that stuff on you again.  I did, but it wasn't...  I did worse, but it wasn't on television.  So the way it's...  I said the way I perceived it.  Wow, they really stick together.  He's not taking a shot at them.  I am not taking a shot at them.  No, that's commendable by her, though.  It certainly is.  Because you would think she'd be talking crap, but she's not.  They're a very close-knit family.  They're a brother.  It's good.  It's good.  It's fine as hell.  Everyone always gives him hell. 
[00:38:30]  You need to get up with back.  I think he's a cool guy.  See, that's...  Oh, shut up.  Jackass.  I'm not messing with her today.  He's a buddy.  Crap.  He is a buddy, though.  No, you come off like a very close-knit family, but I don't know what to make of it.  Like, a lot of people say, is this really the way the Osbournes live?  Yes.  And...  Okay.  So then that's what I'm saying.  All right.  The perception...  Wait, wait.  Are you happy how the family's portrayed on the show?  Are you happy how you're portrayed?  I mean, do you know what it is?  I don't care how I'm portrayed, because people see you the way they want to see you, even if 
[00:39:00]  it's not really that.  Well, that's what he's getting at, though.  It doesn't mean that's how...  People see you the way they want to see you.  It doesn't mean that's how Jack is in his real life, but he's saying how he's portrayed  on the show.  There was a few little...  Maybe it was a wacky edit or something.  But in general, are you happy how the family's portrayed?  Yeah.  Do you think it's accurate?  Yeah, it is.  It's the way we are.  Don't help him out.  Let him backpedal.  This is a really nice...  I know.  ...groveling jackass.  Like, we didn't get a thousand goddamn emails when we discussed the first episode, which,  you know, I mean, the show took off, and everyone's talking about it. 
[00:39:30]  Like, we didn't get a thousand emails that said, dude, what's with that Jack?  You know, you didn't get that?  Am I the first person that ever said that?  No.  That's why I'm being a little...  Oh, I see, because you've heard it before.  Okay.  And you're sick of hearing it.  There's nothing wrong with him.  Just shut up.  I forgot to...  He's a cool guy.  I was hanging out with his...  Exactly.  He's a cool guy.  He's a cool guy to hang out with.  Is MTV playing the video yet?  I know that they said that they weren't going to play it.  Well, yeah.  Didn't you do one for the... 
[00:40:00]  Oh, yeah.  Like crazy, they're playing it.  I don't watch MTV.  Papa Don't Preach.  Oh, yeah.  They play that, yeah.  They're playing like crazy.  Oh, yeah.  Were you comfortable with that?  It was like, I thought I discovered myself during that, because I never thought I'd be able  to dance in front of the camera.  Did you have a choreographer and everything?  I wasn't like choreographer.  Like, for there was like...  No, I mean just for, you know, some of the little moves.  No.  They did this thing where they sent me to like confidence building classes.  Confidence building?  Where I had to like do stupid things in front of a mirror.  Like what?  Just like cool faces. 
[00:40:30]  It was really awful.  Faces?  I hated it.  Oh, because you got to kind of smile or make like a cute look or something.  It was really...  I hated it.  Really?  Yes.  I was like...  It came off good.  You look adorable in it.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah.  Ask him some questions.  He's here too.  Come on.  Yeah, but they're going to drag you away a lot sooner than him.  We know how this stuff works.  Did you hear that?  I know.  I just got knocked.  Should we walk away together?  No, I know.  Seriously.  Should we walk away together?  I've seen this enough with us.  We can walk away together. 
[00:41:00]  Do this move.  They wind their finger around.  They give you the cut.  They do the cut the throw thing where I was like, all right.  Wrap it up.  But what makes you think I'm going to be here forever?  I'm not.  Seriously.  Have you guys started...  Why am I put in this position?  Because you have a big mouth.  You do not.  You're talking to me.  I got to tell you, he's got a really big mouth all the time.  We're trying to have a good time.  He's very mean.  I am the nicest guy.  We want to do a simple radio show, but he has to take it to the next level all the time.  All the time.  I am the nicest guy, and he is usually very mean and nasty. 
[00:41:30]  She's not going to believe you.  But she's not going to believe you.  He's going very red, so I don't know.  No, it's just sunburned.  It's like 90 out there.  Believe me.  Are you doing any other tunes or anything?  Yeah, I go...  I actually lost two weeks of recording.  For the past two weeks, I was supposed to be in the studio, but yeah.  And you're going to do another video?  I've got an album coming out in October.  You do?  Yeah.  Are you happy about that?  Are you happy about anything?  Yeah.  Have you seen like...  I don't.  If you think about it, that's when, like... 
[00:42:00]  You just don't just do it.  I think if you spend too much time thinking about it, then you'll find things wrong with it.  There's going to be a lot of covers, some original...  Look at him.  He's on his phone.  He's taking phone calls now because he's bored.  That's all right.  I know.  You could ask him a question, you know.  He is here, too.  What do you think of Kelly Osbourne?  She's so beautiful.  Isn't her dad great?  Come on.  Are you guys taping the second season already?  Yes.  They're here right now.  Somewhere.  They're watching us right now.  No.  Actually, they can't film here because it's a union building and they'll have to pay. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  No cameras.  We noticed that.  How is this?  We got ours taken away.  Is the second season going to be different in any way?  No, I don't think so.  I thought you guys were going to film some of it overseas and stuff.  No, I don't.  I don't think so.  That was the rumor on all the magazines and stuff.  I couldn't spend that much time in that house.  I'd have to move to London if I was.  It's like a castle, right?  It's not a castle, but it's in the middle of nowhere.  Really?  It's a haunted store in the town and it's boring.  You don't like it over there anymore?  No, I love it.  I just think it's boring.  Yeah. 
[00:43:00]  Does Amy want to do this season?  Is she going to do this season?  No.  No.  Yeah, what's up with that?  She just decided.  He really is standing right here.  You know, you can't ask him.  Go for it.  No, no.  I'm cool.  I'm just listening.  He's just sitting and listening there.  He's listening.  Well, you came over at the same time.  If anything, you interfered with his interview.  I did not.  She's just starting to like you.  I'm like the innocent bystander that's just changed.  I was the innocent bystander and you guys pulled me in here.  Anybody have a joint?  Do you have a joint on you?  I can smoke while you guys talk.  Garrett will have any kind of pot you need. 
[00:43:30]  We can take care of that.  I just need good pot.  Take care of it.  Do you still go out with your friends and everything and just like hang out with them?  Is it a pain in the ass?  Like, are they like, oh, God, now people are coming over all the time talking to Kelly?  I think I've learned who my real friends are.  Oh, really?  Some of them?  Oh, did this weed out some of the bitches in your life?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can I say that on the right ear?  Yes.  You can say bitch.  It's not that ever-present F word that is on the odd ones all the time.  I was about to say it to people.  I hear in Canada, they're keeping in the curses. 
[00:44:00]  I don't think it's going to be good that way.  I'd like to be.  That's fantastic.  No, I'd rather hear the F word.  I saw it in Germany and it was all blast, full blast.  Really?  Yeah, no beeps, no nothing.  It was great.  It was like watching a different show.  Was it in German, though?  Was it dubbed?  No, no.  No, it wasn't.  That would be.  No, there was like subtitles.  It would be so funny if they dubbed it over in German.  Would they put your brother in a little German uniform?  All right.  I'm kidding.  Of course.  I love it.  Look how much I'm talking about him.  Kelly, see how he is?  We forgot all about that.  He has to go right back to it. 
[00:44:30]  I think Jack is great.  Hey, I'm teasing.  Was your sister supposed to sing Papa Don't Preach?  No.  No?  Because I heard something.  one of her own songs.  Really?  But I'd never written a song before that time and I didn't, so I just wanted to cover  songs.  Does she want to get into recording something?  She is.  She's just doing it in her own time, like her own deal.  She doesn't.  Is she a little like, man, Kelly got this kind of...  Yes, you are.  I just want to get to the bottom of certain things.  I read a lot of stuff.  Now she's cursing me at you.  Kelly, I read a lot of things and I want to separate the truth from the fiction that I 
[00:45:00]  read and the only way to do it is to talk to the source.  That's all.  I can't believe everything that you read.  I know.  That's why.  Yes, stupid.  Believe me.  I know.  All right.  I'll shut up.  I'll shut up.  How does it feel to be going on between Zombie and Ozzy?  Isn't that great?  Who?  I'm asking him a question.  What?  Who?  Shavo.  From System of the Down.  Uh-oh. 
[00:45:30]  Kelly just turned around.  Could you get me out of here?  No.  No?  That's a great honor to go on right before Ozzy.  That's what I'm saying.  Oh, it's amazing.  It really is.  Do you enjoy your dad's music?  That's cool.  Wait, what happened to Shavo?  I know.  He only gets one question?  It's all good.  I smoke and talk.  I actually don't want to talk.  He's got some of Garrett's best in his hand.  I don't want to talk right now.  Go on.  Okay, good.  All right.  Now he's happy.  How long did that take you to grow?  Is that an interview?  Like five years?  Five years ago?  I've had it ever since I met you.  Yeah.  It's an ongoing thing.  All right. 
[00:46:00]  Now they're doing the interview.  I couldn't imagine having facial hair.  No?  A good thing.  That would suck for you.  I know.  It wouldn't be a good look.  I know a lot of girls with that little thing going on in their top layer.  You see that?  They wax it.  Bleach it or something.  A lot of them don't get it waxed off.  You could still tell.  Yeah.  You could still tell.  Tell he's like, whatever.  How long did it take you to get used to cameras being around your 24 hours?  It was only like the first week.  Like the first week I'd come down like fully faced up and dressed up like, look at me.  And I was like, oh, I can't do this anymore.  And that was like, most of the time I didn't even like have any makeup on. 
[00:46:30]  I was in my pajamas.  Are there off-limits places where the cameras can go?  I didn't like them in my bedroom.  Yeah.  I didn't.  They weren't allowed in my mom's and dad's bedroom, but now they are.  Yeah.  Now they're going to be allowed?  Yeah.  What the hell can we expect from that?  What?  What?  What can we expect from that?  Are you mad?  I'm just like, are you trying to say that?  No.  Don't put words in my mouth, you ass.  Kelly picked up on it.  I did.  I'm saying, what the hell?  Like, I know there are things that happen that cannot.  MTV would not air that. 
[00:47:00]  I'm just saying, what could we see in the bedroom that we...  A bed?  She doesn't want to talk about her parents having sex, MTV, so why are you going there?  I'm blowing myself up here.  Why are you going there?  I wanted to make a good impression in front of Kelly.  I think she's adorable and very good on the show and everything, and I'm coming off like  an ass.  I'm sorry.  That would have been ruining it for everybody.  Why did you have to ask about Ozzy's bedroom?  It's not our business.  I didn't.  I said they're going to tamed it.  I'm going to smack you.  I'm smacking you.  I'm sorry, Kelly.  I didn't mean to offend you.  Now Kelly's blushing.  Or anything like that. 
[00:47:30]  I'm just saying, what could they get away with showing that would make putting the cameras  in the bedroom a special thing?  Like, are there conversations that happen?  How the hell do I know?  How does she know that?  I don't know.  And you do that.  She's just...  You could dump that out down the line.  Well, why are the cameras in the bedroom, then?  See?  I guess that's what you wanted to ask instead of asking about their sex life, Anthony.  I didn't say...  See?  See?  See, Kelly?  I didn't say a goddamn thing about that. 
[00:48:00]  She said after you were thinking, I guarantee you.  Oh, defend him.  They're hoping to catch a discussion or an argument or something.  If it happens, they want to have the cameras rolling.  That's all it is.  But I doubt they've really been there for very long.  Thank you, Kelly Norton.  I'm just trying to...  They can't go in.  Oh, no, that's okay.  I'm working.  No, I sound like your eyes are...  No, I sound like I'm high.  I'm all severed.  You're better, yeah.  Hey, is the nanny going to be back for the second season?  Yeah, she's right.  Well, she went to the bathroom there, but she is. 
[00:48:30]  She's got her hands full.  Today, I did something very bad.  There was somebody outside the hotel, and he was asking for an autograph, and he was not very attractive.  And he asked Melinda for a picture, and he put his arm around her, and I was like, isn't she a muffin?  And he's like, yeah, she is.  She's real cute.  He started rubbing her, and I just ran off and left her with the guy.  Very lovely.  Now, she's got her hands filled with Jack, getting him awake for school and stuff.  Actually, me, we don't go to school anymore. 
[00:49:00]  We did the homeschooling thing during the break and finished everything.  Oh, really?  That really won't be a problem anymore.  That was a big part of the first season that I really liked, that you guys just weren't going to school, and the nanny's trying to get Jack.  I've been to school in years.  I hate school.  But Jack was still going to some kind of public school because, you know, she was trying to wake him up all the time.  You know what it is?  Uh-oh.  Is that school just never was very fun for me and my brother because we just didn't get along with the kids for a while.  And it was very uncomfortable.  Well, you guys discussed it in the first season.  It's kind of a drag being known as Ozzy's kids sometimes, right? 
[00:49:30]  It's not a drag being that.  Oh, or the stupid questions they bring up.  What are you saying, Opie?  Why would it be a drag?  Now you put your foot in your mouth there.  No, no.  They discussed this on the first season, so I am sick.  No, no.  They never said it was a drag to the Ozzy's kids.  They asked you guys the same stupid questions about, you know, your father bit the head off a bat or bit the head off a dove.  No, it's pure immaturity.  It's like, as soon as, like, the minute that somebody leaves high school, they change.  Yeah.  Why is that?  Because you don't have to go to school anymore. 
[00:50:00]  No, no, no.  Just, like, the whole, like, attitude of someone.  Like, the minute they leave high school, they change.  Into the real world, yeah.  Because high school is very clicky.  Did you do well in school?  Like, good grades and stuff?  Like, with grades.  Like, I do the work, and I get good, like, test grades, but I just was never that.  What do you want to do?  Like, where do you want to end up?  I don't know.  I'm 17.  I should know.  Yeah, but you have, like, a little idea or something.  Shut up, Jim.  I'm sorry.  God, I'm going to hit you.  All right.  Why put the pressure on her?  It's not pressure.  It is pressure.  A lot of kids have some idea of what they might want to do with their life. 
[00:50:30]  Maybe she just wants to hang for a couple of years.  Why pressure the girl?  Okay.  I say you take your time and relax.  There's no rush.  I can't do one thing without me looking like a dick.  Well, we all see it, and I don't know what's wrong.  You all right?  I don't know what's wrong.  I don't know what's wrong.  I don't know what's wrong.  I don't know what's wrong.  I don't know what's wrong.  You all right?  Bravo.  What do you want to do when you grow up?  I want to be like her.  I want to be like Mike.  That's what I want to do. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, okay.  Were there any moments they showed that you wish they had edited?  Like, ugh.  No.  When Jack almost pulled your pants down?  That was kind of funny.  You really watch the show, don't you?  No, I am a huge fan of the show.  I love it.  I don't even watch it.  What's funny about Jack pulling her pants down?  There was a cute brother and sister moment.  No one wants to see my white arm.  That's a very embarrassing moment for her, and you think it was funny.  You must get e-mail or just letters or whatever from people that really enjoy it.  Like stupid letters.  What's the dumbest thing?  Remember on episode four, when you weren't wearing a bra? 
[00:51:30]  That was funny.  I'm like, what are you talking about?  That's not what I meant when I wrote that.  I must confess.  And what episode was that?  I don't know.  People just make up things.  I don't know.  And you guys are friends with Elijah Wood?  Yeah.  Because he came over.  He's a really nice guy.  Are you still friends with him, or is he one of those persons you realize who your  real friends are?  No.  Not like that.  Okay.  I'm getting scared again.  No, it's just that he's been working a lot, and we've been really busy. 
[00:52:00]  We haven't seen each other for a long time.  Yeah.  Any more Hollywood friends like that?  No, I don't like famous people, really.  Really?  Yeah.  Then you're like us.  We sure as crap ain't famous.  It's not.  I find that a lot of people who are famous, it just kind of happens.  Me and my brother, we didn't really want it.  It was never something that we really wanted to do or be.  And then, a lot of people who are famous, it's something that they've worked for, it's  something that they want.  So they have this whole ego about themselves. 
[00:52:30]  It's just, I don't like it.  Yeah, you guys just kind of fell into it like that.  Did you know the show was going to be as huge as it got?  Really?  I thought I was cramping myself for the first couple weeks.  Like, no, I don't want anyone to watch it.  It's going to be so bad.  And then before you knew it, it was like the biggest thing.  That's great.  Well, best, best of luck on season two.  And Chavo's famous too, Anthony.  Yeah.  I'm being like you guys now, watch.  He's not talking now.  Are you all right?  Look what you did.  Totally cool. 
[00:53:00]  I'm still in there.  You made him feel almost invisible.  And that really sucked.  No, I didn't.  Look what you did.  And who did that, Kelly?  What?  Who did that?  It wasn't me.  Yes, of course.  It was you, Anthony.  I was actually listening.  I don't feel invisible.  This was a good moment for me because I'm usually going there.  Oh, there it goes.  Okay, I have to go now.  You can see that.  I saw a head twitch.  Come on.  Let's go.  We're out of here.  All right, bye.  Kelly, thank you very much.  Can I get a picture with you, Kelly?  All right.  Here it is.  One of Jimmy's great picture moments.  Kelly Osborne, of course. 
[00:53:30]  Chavo.  Am I gone too?  Is this going on with me?  No, man.  If you want to hang, we're hanging.  We're hanging.  Do you have any questions for me?  Not really.  All right, I'm out here.  Now he's being the dick.  He shook my hand, though.  Thanks, man.  Actually, we've got to take a break, I think.  Yes.  It's Obie and Anthony.  We're backstage at OzFest having a good time.  I hope it sounds like something out there.  When we get back, we've got to get to the lesbian sandwich booth,  and we've got to get an update from the med tent, 
[00:54:00]  and I think Rick's going to be in the mosh pit with that ancient equipment in a little while.  Did Jim just get Kelly with you to drop something?  I think so, yes.  That's a famous one, Jim.  Anthony, what's wrong with you today?  I did nothing.  Shut up.  You hung me out to dry, and you suck.  I'm getting you back for the John Hinckley thing.  Hate you.  You bastard.  I tried that joke out on you.  You loved it.  Hate you.  And you failed to tell me that I had the wrong serial killer.  Oh, yeah.  That made up for it, hanging me out to dry to an Osborne.  How uncomfortable was that?  Totally.  For a 17-year-old girl, I've got to tell you, Kelly Osborne is very, very intimidating. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  Why?  What am I?  She's a 17-year-old girl.  Oh, yeah.  But you were asking some...  Yes, Jimmy.  Shut up.  You were so loving that today.  Pouring kerosene on the fire.  Dude, I'm Gary Gravel.  She's an Osborne.  I know what was great about that.  When you try to explain to someone that doesn't really know the show, they're never going to  believe you.  And it's like, look, no, I'm really the nice guy.  He's the idiot.  She's looking at you like that.  I swear, let me play you something. 
[00:55:00]  Right.  Poor guy from the system of a town.  Yeah, I mean, I did nothing wrong.  We got the guys.  Take it easy, Mr. Hanale.  We got him some weed there.  He's all right.  He's a good Hanale reference.  He's all right.  Look at him.  Yeah, he's happy.  I think he got him.  He's dropping stuff over there.  He really is dropping stuff.  He's got his one hitter in his bag.  I think the baseline is going to be a little off tonight when they hit the stage.  No, that's how they play.  No, I'm just kidding, bro.  Stinky smuggler.  All right. 
[00:55:30]  Are we ready to go back out there, Rick?  You want to go into the mosh pit?  I want to hear the medical tent, too.  I want to hear something from that.  I think where you want to go, the medical tent with the equipment or the mosh tent?  We can do both because they're right near each other.  All right.  Very cool.  Well, we're going to step aside and regroup here and figure it out.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Of course, Jim Norton with us.  We're backstage at OzFest.  Boo-boo-boo-boo-boo.  Wow.  Boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo.  Wow.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I find the most erotic part of a woman is the boobies.

[01:06:00]  Outside of New York City  866-2774  Wow  Irene  Yeah?  What's wrong with you?  What's wrong with me is that I want to know something  Hi, Irene  How come you're politically incorrect with some people, which is okay  But some other people, you're scared and you step on people  You act like you're on eggshells  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  Please explain  Well, for instance, certain ethnic groups, you don't give a damn how you degrade them 
[01:06:30]  Be blunt  But the other ones  And say what you mean  What ethnic groups  Be very plain and clear here  The black people, you seem to get very frightened of offending them  They kill people  You're not afraid of offending black people  Yes, you are  You're absolutely wrong  No?  We all are afraid of it  Okay, and why are you specializing in some soft porn crap?  I mean, what are you doing?  You're catering to the jerks of this country and that's how you make a salary?  What are you talking about?  Yes  What is wrong with you? 
[01:07:00]  What are you talking about?  People don't act like you  Go out on the street  Why don't you get to the point of what you're saying?  People sell drugs on the street  I'm saying, how come you're specializing in this soft porn crap?  What soft porn?  How fat are you, Cher concert goer?  How fat are you?  Well, how fat I am?  That you don't like making women  Yes  125 pounds  Really?  Then you must have an ugly mug  Long red hair  Oh, good  Irene  It's not hot right either  Beautiful, big, green eyes  Irene, can I ask you  Who the hell cares?  Let me ask you  What I'm saying is that you specialize in soft porn  You specialize in the low elements of people 
[01:07:30]  Irene, can I ask you something?  And you love it  Irene  You're 35 to 40 years old  God, I've got to ask Irene something, but you won't listen  Irene  Irene, how did you get to know this show?  I listen to it sometimes  Why?  Because sometimes  Why?  You know why?  Why?  Sometimes you're funny  Then you lose it  You lose it  You don't appreciate the girls that come in  No  What you call the soft girls  Well, that's part of us  And part of our show  And there are two women who are mentally deranged 
[01:08:00]  Who obviously don't have any self-esteem  Three now  And you just degrade them to hell  Oh, we ripped them apart  What the hell is wrong with them?  You are a sad, sad woman  We ripped them apart  You are the saddest woman  You're sad  No, you're not  Yes, I am  You're obsessed with this show  And it pisses you off  And you love being pissed  So you keep coming back  I love to laugh  And I think that sometimes you're funny  I love to laugh  And I think that sometimes you're intelligent  But you are  You really go out of your way to degrade people 
[01:08:30]  And you don't  You don't  What nationality are you?  What nationality are you?  What nationality are you?  What nationality am I?  I don't  I don't think it's important  Why not?  You're talking about nationality  You stupid dishonest coward  Speak the truth  Tell us the truth  What nationality are you?  You degrade  Shut your lying face, dummy  What are you, a racist?  I'm very nervous that you don't offend certain groups  You're absolutely wrong  If you're going to be politically incorrect  Be politically incorrect with everybody  You are an insane 
[01:09:00]  You're a dishonest  You're probably a real racist  And we're joking  What ethnic group are you a member of?  Stupid  F*** you, you stupid  That's right, you white trash whore  That's right, whatever you are  Use your dirty language  You filthy mouthed, poorly raised hooker  I used to work there  I used to work there  Don't tell me  Don't tell me anything  I'm 50 years old  Exactly, you aging meat bag with one breast  You act like 12  50 years old 
[01:09:30]  And I don't know  You don't work there  We like acting 12  And we like young women  Young women with firm  Firm breasts  Boom  Did she say she used to work here?  Because the teenagers are a bunch of suck ass jerks  That's right  You filthy mouthed senior citizen  Thank him for that  That's a nice language for a grandmother  You old bag of meat  Nice language for an old lady  Irene, you used to work here?  She hung up  Typical of a hole like that 
[01:10:00]  Hang up  I don't think she was white  She didn't sound white  Whatever she was  Why don't you offend black people?  What are you talking?  Shut up, stupid  I hate old, deluded people  You 50-year-old, one-breasted bag of meat  Just hang it up  And be grateful that some of your friends are still living  If that exchange isn't worthy of a Jim Norton promo  I don't know what is  I saw Steve going, yeah  I hate people that don't tell the truth  Be honest about where you're coming from  I thought she was endearing  Dude, she was an old pig  I don't like Jim Norton  I don't think he's funny 
[01:10:30]  Or I don't like Opie and Anthony  Alright, you accept that  Because it's an honest point of view  But when you're coming from like this  I hate the fact that my youth is gone  And I listen sometimes  Like Anthony pointed out  I like to be mad  Just be honest that you like to be angry  So that's why you listen  I hate liars  She enjoys listening to get angry  Dude, people don't think the show is funny  I accept that  That's a taste, judgment, call, fine  But just stop being so  And then she's going  Are you effing?  Exactly, show your true colors  You uneducated, ancient pig  But guys 
[01:11:00]  You cryptic, filthy-mouthed old grandmother  With no love left  In your one-breasted life  I'm 125 pounds  And she doesn't have hot red hair  It's probably orange with green eyes  Boy, that's really sexy  You glow-in-the-dark bag of pig meat  Bright green eyes and red hair  Do you have any primary colors?  That bozo hair  That bozo color  Yeah, big, big, big, red, awful orange hair  That's really sexy  I want to put my mule into a sun-kissed  With two little emeralds staring out of it 
[01:11:30]  Just big, beautiful green eyes  Men never care about your eyes  We don't care, ladies  We just don't care about your eyes  I like them  I love them  I don't care about them  See, because you don't look at the person as a human, man  No, I like a human  You look at them as an object  I think, I swear to you  The eyes are the best  No one likes  No one likes eyes  Just sealing them shut  With his seed  Yeah, they're not the best thing  You're  You're sick  If you don't look at eyes  Dude, I look at them when I have to 
[01:12:00]  When I'm apologizing the next morning  But I don't like to stare at them  Because usually they're crying  Maybe that's it  Do you understand what I mean  About that person?  That's what makes me so angry  So just be honest  About why you don't like somebody  Don't try to be clever  And pseudo-manipulative  Just tell the truth  What you don't like  Get to the point  That's soft core stuff  I just hate that  Just a jealous old lady  Really, really  Absent to rage  We didn't get on the blacks enough  For some reason  That really annoyed me  Like, what do you want us to say about black people?  We goof on everybody  But you don't want to be vicious 
[01:12:30]  You want blacklisters and whitelisters  And that's not being politically correct, stupid  I just want to bang women of all races  So I don't want to alienate anybody  Creepy old racist whore  Irene's calling back  Irene, what's wrong now?  Can't get enough  No, I just want to tell you  That I'm no old hag  If you pass me on the street  You wouldn't recognize me  I got a call  Number one  Tell that guy that I'm no old hag  And what if I was?  So what?  Would that make me less of a person?  Yes  No, it would not  You see, you're so mainstream 
[01:13:00]  You're trying to be so cool  But you're mainstream America  Yeah  So what the hell are you talking about?  You don't think there's any old, good-looking, sexy people?  You saw that chick from Midnight Cowboy?  You were going to ask me for money?  Get away from that? You'd have no idea  I'm a sexy chick  Can an old lady yell like this?  She wouldn't have the energy  It's not the fact that you might be  Yes, I used to work there  It's not your age that I care about  It's your thinking  It's your mentality  I don't care how  No, my mentality is this  Can you let me finish a sentence?  You finish, you let me finish  That was what bothered me  It wasn't the fact that you might be 50 
[01:13:30]  I don't care  I don't have sex with a 50-year-old woman  Like yourself  I mean, I'd probably feed you  Maybe some  Pull your diapers off and enjoy you  I'm not saying that  Your age doesn't bother me  No, I'll tell you what bothers me  You degrade people  This station  I don't like the full porn  And I want to know  What kind of teenager  You have to cater to  To get ratings  Why can't you be  And tell  The black funny people  That you are  You let it out  What the crap  You want to degrade black people  Those two ladies  That you come to me 
[01:14:00]  Irene  Irene, if I could  Because they loved it  That's right  You're right  Why do they love it  Why do you have to feed into it  If you want to bring up ratings  We do very well in the ratings  With people that are a lot older  I'm not surprised  Than their teens  Irene  That's probably their parents  Well, whatever  The point is  You're making me sound like  Why can't you be funny  You can't stop  And intelligent  Without being disgusting and degrading  So you know what's funny and entertaining  To everybody else  People are stupid 
[01:14:30]  Young people are stupid  See, you arrogant old bitch  You know what's deep inside  She is so jealous of youth  She's jealous of youth  Young people  Young people  You jealous old  Angry elitist  I am not old  I used to be a young person  Just ten years ago  When I was young  I didn't do this  You are an ass, Irene  You are an ass  My mother  Hey, stop  You're being disgusting now  Stop trying to be clever  What kind of dignified  Senior citizen are you?

No  I wanted that laughter in the background stop  He was a great guy  He was a wonderful liberal  He was a wonderful, cool guy  You would love him if you knew him  Irene, what happened on that bathroom floor?

[01:18:30]  He's fully alive  And he's listening to you  He's not  He is  Why do you have a vested interest  In not believing in the afterlife?  When do you think his jaw dropped?  Yeah  Let me tell you something  He went bye-bye in the box  I could tell you pictures of him  That would put you to shame  He was a gorgeous guy  And he's still alive  He's still alive  He crossed over  He's still alive  Shots and he's still alive  How long were you dating Virgil Salazzo?  30 years  30 years? 
[01:19:00]  Why didn't he marry you?  Wait, I want to hear the story  This is very strange  Yes, she's right  Why are you doing this?  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  30 years  Hold on, Irene  So what happened?  He went into the bathroom  To take a, what, a bath?  No, no  I came home one day  And he said  He was in bed  And he said  I said, what's wrong?  And it was 6 o'clock  He said, oh, I think I have the flu  Oh  I said, oh, you know  Like I was like  You know, I said, okay  So I just went about my business  Which is  And then  Are you feeling guilty 
[01:19:30]  That you didn't bring him to  A hospital at that point?  I mean, about that dying  I had nothing to do with it  No, no, about not bringing him to the hospital  Maybe you should have taken him to the hospital  Oh, yeah  There was talk of that  And I thought it was the flu  There was no clutching of the chest  Right  Or a pain or anything  So he thought he had the flu  So he was even, like, getting up  And going to the refrigerator now and then  Yeah  He did keep going to the bathroom  So I figured, gee, he must have a virus  Right  2 o'clock in the morning  I'm woken up  And my  His uncle was living with us 
[01:20:00]  You know, his uncle didn't  Never married  Right  I said, what is that noise?  Gay guy  And I said, what noise?  He said, I heard somebody  A commotion in the bathroom  And then I heard some guy say  Help me  Help me  Oh, no  And I said  I went in there  And I still thought it was the flu  And I go in there  And I say, what's wrong?  Yeah  And he says  He couldn't answer me  And so we moved him  But it was like moving dead meat  Oh, boy  So I called the ambulance  And I saw him sit up  Looked straight ahead of me  As if he was looking at something 
[01:20:30]  Yeah  And there was no pain  There was no screaming  There was no yelling  There was no clutching of the chest  And he said  I'll be all right  I'm going to be all right  I said, oh, yeah  Oh, that's great  So I turned my back  Called the ambulance  Ambulance came  One, two, three  Didn't let us see anything  Put us in the police car  To drive us to the hospital  Yeah  The police car wasn't moving  And then they came back and said  That's it  He's finished  You think that's funny?

Yeah, we make it okay  By just apologizing  Oh, Irene  I'm really sorry  I am sorry  Okay, okay  But listen to this  We're obviously going for a cheap laugh  Yeah  So, uh, sorry  Okay  But the point is  Is that  I don't like  Your soft porn  I don't know why you degrade  You know what?  You're actually right  And you know what? 
[01:21:30]  I don't like  I think I know why you're doing it  Because nobody would be listening  Irene, you're right  You're right  You know what?  I don't like  I don't like annoying lazy girlfriends  Who tell their boyfriends  To go back to bed  When they're having heart pain  They're not  He wasn't having heart pain  My God  See the signs next time  What?

No, I'm not  Yeah  Why don't you talk to John Edwards?  John Edwards?  I watched him 
[01:22:00]  He's wonderful  Maybe he can put you in touch  With your boyfriend  No, no  I'm not interested in that  I like Gary Zukos  So your boyfriend could yell at you  For not taking him to the hospital  Have you ever heard of Gary Zukos?  Have you ever heard of Gary Zukos?  No  No, why?  Did he also kill someone he loved by laziness?  What?  Who is he?  Wasn't he the guy that hung around  With John Travolta in Greece?  No, no, no  Find out who he is  Oh, I forgot  The point is  Maybe your husband  Maybe your husband faked his own death to get away from you  Yes  I wish  I really wish  Because that would be better than what's now

[01:42:00]  On YSP.  It used to pick up a little CB horse.  Come on, man. 
[01:42:30]  Remember the big CB radio craze?  I was like in my early teens.  And it was a way to get girls, you know?  Yeah.  Okay.  Breaker, Breaker19.  Go ahead, good buddy.  Yeah.  Breaker for a radio check.  You're coming in four by four, good buddy.  Thank you. 
[01:43:00]  And then you're sitting there like, yeah, what else can I say?  I'm coming back.  I'm 10, 10, 10-8 on the side waiting for you, good buddy.  There.  Because I didn't drive, so what was the use?  You're just sitting in there.  It can't be like, you know.  I'm double nickels all the way.  Looking out for the Smokies.  Yeah.  Oh, look at that.  We got some pretty seat covers here today.  Down the old blacktop.  Keep her between the ditches, good buddy. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  Well, all right.  I did that.  What else can I say?  I'm just on the CB.  What was your handle, Ant?  Oh.  I got to explain this.  It's just never.  Explaining never works on this show, does it?  I was living in California at the time, and I was very equestrian.  I had a horse, and I used to ride, and my handle, because I ran a rent string. 
[01:44:00]  This guy I knew had a rent string, so you used to take these Marines from Camp Pendleton that wanted to be a cowboy for the weekend,  and guide them up in the hill.  So I was like the guide, and I'd take them up there, and then go down, and back down the hill, and get the next batch, and bring them up.  And so I was the wrangler with you.  Hey, good buddy.  You got the wrangler.  Good buddy. 
[01:44:30]  The foot wrangler.  Ah, shut up.  What was your handle?  Diamond dust.  Diamond dust?  Fag!  That's worse than...  What's diamond dust?  That's worse than butt wrangler?  It wasn't butt wrangler.  It was the wrangler.  Because a wrangler was a guy on a horse that got together the livestock.  Diamond dust?  I don't know. 
[01:45:00]  Hey, you got the diamond dust.  Hello, diamond dust.  Butt plug, you out there?  Good buddy?  Go ahead with your little cute story.  Why?  Got your ears on?  This here's a rubber duck.  A rubber duck, bitch.  Big fan, come on.  You shake the trees, I'll rake the leaves, good buddy.  For sure, for sure.  Oh, God.  Clear the flag town.  God.  Shut this off.  Yeah, we definitely got the front door. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  Buddy mercy.  Thanks a lot.  We got us a convoy.  We got a convoy.  I was a kid looking for chicks.  Were you in a roller skate?  Hey, it's a chick in a roller skate.  Uh-oh.  All right.  Hey, take her down to Double Nickels up by the interstate, good buddy.  We got a Kojak with a Kodak.  Good buddy, taking pictures, giving away invitations.  I'll be back. 
[01:46:00]  I got to go 10-100.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you see any Tijuana taxis out there?  We got us a Tijuana taxi.  Whoa, I just got passed by a crazy man on a crotch rocket.  You better watch out for the Smokies.  All right, come on, everybody.  All right.  All right.  Meet you up at the Chokin' Puke. 
[01:46:30]  All right, the Wrangler.  Well, explain the rest of your story.  So then there was this girl that I used to communicate with on the Citizens Band.  And her handle was Dreamweaver.  You dick.  Rick had to get the song and everything.  Dreamweaver.  Dreamweaver, this is the Wrangler.  You got your ears on? 
[01:47:00]  And she sounded hot.  Yeah.  So I invited her down to ride horses.  The key, ladies and gentlemen.  She sounded hot.  What do you look like, Ant?  Shut up.  Shut up.  All right, go ahead.  So I was all excited for my little date.  And I saddled up my horse and the other horse.  And kind of...  Shut up.  Dreamweaver. 
[01:47:30]  I'll meet you down at the stable at 2 o'clock in the afternoon.  This is the Wrangler, over and out.  Dreamweaver.  So I'm all excited.  You're an ass, man.  I believe we can't.  So, uh...  All right, so you...  I saddle up my horse.  And I spend time, you know, brushing the horses, making sure they look all good and everything.  And then I saddle up the other horse.  And I take the reins and put her on the saddle horn.  And I'm kind of trailering the other horse, you know. 
[01:48:00]  Down to meet her by the riverbed.  Where we were going to ride.  Well...  Well, she comes, uh, walking up.  And I see kind of in the distance.  I'm like, okay, that must be her.  All right, now, wait, wait.  Now, you did say that you had the 10 and everything and you were hoping to score in the woods, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I packed, like, a whole thing.  Saddle bags were all packed up with a couple of beers.  And I had bedrolls and a tent just in case things went well. 
[01:48:30]  Because we had a bunch of hills to ride up in and stuff.  I'm going to camp out with my Dreamweaver.  Dreamweaver, tell your mom you're going to be spending the night, Dreamweaver.  Tell her you're at a friend's house because we're going to camp out.  This is the Wrangler.  Over and out.  I'm 10-10-10-8.  On the side, Dreamweaver.  Looking forward to my little date.  Yeah.  Well, she comes up.  Even before I was gravely disappointed, the horse that had a carrier looked pissed. 
[01:49:00]  I wasn't sure if I should take the saddle off of the horse, put it on her, and let the horse ride her.  Dreamweaver.  She was huge.  Dreamweaver.  I believe you can get me free.  All right.  Yes, I was gravely disappointed.  I believe you can get me free. 
[01:49:30]  So, Dreamweaver was a big...  Are you a Wrangler?  Yes.  Please don't be Dreamweaver.  I'm Dreamweaver.  All right.  Let's go for a ride.  So, we went, like, up and down the riverbed for about an hour.  I was like, oh, look at the time.  Here I had, like, bedrolls on the back of this thing. 
[01:50:00]  It was like I was Paw Ingles going up to Walnut Grove.  I was going to go over the river for a week to go get supplies for the family.  I mean, I had this thing packed out, like a pack mule.  You were ready to rock.  I was like a prospector.  I had crap hanging off the horses.  Oh, look at the time.  You were ready to rock.  I was ready to rock.  Good Dreamweaver.  I had firearms.  I was going to hunt her food.  And I realized looking at her, I'd need to bag a moose.  So, you know.  We used to hunt.  You were hunting little rabbits and stuff. 
[01:50:30]  Feeding her would be forget about it.  Gee, okay.  No, there's not many bison left on the plane.  I could live off your thigh for a couple of weeks.  I can't breathe.  Oh, it was horrid.  I was so disappointed because she's talking that she, you know.  Oh, yeah.  I look like Tatum O'Neal.  Yeah, sure you do.  Great.  So, I let her, you know, I let her off and she rode off into the distance. 
[01:51:00]  You didn't do the drive-by?  How are you going to do a drive-by on horseback?  Well, I'm the only guy with two horses, one empty.  Are you a wrangler?  No.  You should have.  No, just looking for another girl.  You should have tried to, like, meet her in town or something.  Did the drive-by.  The whole thing was riding up like Clint friggin' Eastwood, dude.  I understand that.  I had the whole look.  You've got to remember something.  I'm a kid.  I'm, like, maybe 13 years old. 
[01:51:30]  And this was mid-70s.  I had cowboy attire on.  Believe me.  This was in San Juan Capistrano, California.  A very equestrian town.  Used to ride.  This was what we did, you know?  And I'm, like, you know, I had firearms on me.  I swear to God, I had a pistol.  Just in case I had a fight for her honor.  For any bandoleros.  Meanwhile, they'd have been, you keep her. 
[01:52:00]  We don't want her.  Maybe she could pull the wagon.  Oh, man.  But this was, like, I was so pumped up for this.  And so was she.  Pumped up.  But, yeah, it was very disappointing.  But to bring it all back to the beginning of this story, she was a girl.  All right.  I haven't laughed that hard in a while.  My eyes are tearing.  This song brings back memories every time I hear it.  I've got to tell you, to this day, when I hear Dreamweaver, I think it'll. 
[01:52:30]  We're the Lounge Day.  Oh, man.  One big door.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I love that.  Right after Opie and Anthony.

When he was doing that, did he?  He gave her the rape hotline and the geriatric rape hotline.  Yeah, right?  I blame Viagra.  Right.  You popped three at one time, my friend.  You're going after anybody.  You get a 97-year-old guy that does Viagra. 
[02:03:00]  All of a sudden, his junk starts working.  What do you think?  What do you think?  He's going to look at a 97-year-old woman and go,  Let's get it on.  Exactly.  First of all, there ain't no woman Viagra,  so that thing is just like a desert.  Right, so he figured that this 12, 13-year-old girl  will be the one.  Well, he shouldn't have gone all the way  to the other end of the spectrum, you know.  Get a nice spring chicken of 55 or something.  A lot of people don't know what they do  when they wake up after the Viagra.  They're not sure.  Right, maybe all the blood rust out of his head  and he just went wild.  Now, before they had Viagra,  I'm hanging out with my dad at the Oakland Rosa show 
[02:03:30]  and walking around.  He's married to this new woman.  And we're walking around and he's going,  he had to shoot a needle into his...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I'm telling you.  No, hold on, hold on.  We're just cleaning up because they dumped out of that.  I don't know why, believe me.  It makes no sense.  Believe me, we understand.  It makes no sense.  You should be able to say that  because it's a medical thing  and that's what he had to do.  Put the needle into his...  He did, okay.  My father had to get...  But you can't say the P word for the guy's thing.  You could say...  We say mule, we say yam bag, we say junk.  You got it.  So here's the thing.  My dad's junk is not working as well as it should be 
[02:04:00]  because he had a couple of heart attacks, four.  Actually, they actually...  Your dad had four.  Yeah, they actually revoked his organ donor card.  Yeah.  So he's talking to me.  What's he talking to me?  The father-son talk, which is freaked me out.  I'm walking around the Oklahoma street  and he goes...  He's going, yeah, so before the Viagra thing,  I had this needle and you had to shoot it.  And he goes, one day, he goes,  I figured they give me...  They say 10 cc's you shoot in.  And I figured...  So my dad goes...  Shoot it right into the...  The junk.  Yeah, into the junk.  And he goes...  He goes, I think 10 cc's is close to what I'm doing.  The doctor says, don't use any more 10 cc's.  Well, I'm thinking, you know,  I want to perform for the new lady.  Can I slow you down a little bit? 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  Because I don't get it.  So what?  So before Viagra...  But what do you...  Oh, before Viagra,  there was something you could...  Yes, my dad got married to this woman, right?  Right.  And he wanted to make sure she was...  But what does this stuff do?  It does what Viagra does.  Yeah, yeah.  No, actually, I think it took the...  It probably takes the place of the blood  that would normally go there  to put it in the state that you...  No, it was a chemical.  It was something because it...  Whatever, it constricted everything  so it would...  Oh, my God.  So it really...  So this junk would expand.  Hey, is that good?  I did this.  Yeah, that's good.  That's good.  All right, go ahead.  I'm just getting a needle. 
[02:05:00]  So walking around the road  to the showroom,  my dad's talking to me.  He goes, yeah,  just like tossing it off.  He goes, so I'm going to use it, right?  And he goes, I figure 10 cc.  They said, you know,  10 cc is my normal.  I'll do 30 cc.  So my dad's junk turned.  He goes, my junk turned black.  And he goes,  and it took 11 hours.  11 hours to go down.  And I'm walking around there.  I'm literally like just bowed over laughing.  That's funny.  I couldn't imagine having to put a needle. 
[02:05:30]  No.  No.  I'm getting that feeling.  Don't you get that feeling down there  when somebody even talks about it?  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, ah.  Exactly.  Yeah, yeah.  I shouldn't imagine any woman  across the room going,  you know, you are so sexy.  Give me my syringe.  Yeah, yeah.  See how important it is?  Let's do it.  What?  See how important sex is to guys?  If you're willing to take a needle  and jam it into your junk,  it's a pretty important thing.  Exactly.  It's a fair perspective  for all the ladies out there.  Hey, what happened to Happy Face?  He was calling back after the commercials  and no Happy Face. 
[02:06:00]  Dice down at the Ground Zero.  We're a little distracted,  Christopher Titus,  because Dice called all emotional.  He wasn't ready to,  he wasn't in the right state of mind  to be on our show.  And we wanted to go to Ground Zero.  Then we found out he was going down to Ground Zero.  We want to see how that went for him.  I'm just imagining the guys  that are down there now working  are probably like,  all right, you know,  De Niro was here a few months ago  and we just really want to pave this road  and get this done.  Exactly.  You know, enough with the visits.  Enough with the visits.  Yeah, we're doing our job  and, you know, 
[02:06:30]  enough with the visits.  Yeah, well, it just becomes  a little more about the personality  that's going down there  than it does about Ground Zero.  Yeah, huh?  Yeah, if you want to go...  I got my superhero jacket on  with the studs.  If you want to go down  and not tell the press you're going,  I kind of buy that you want to see it.  But if you go,  hey, you know,  tell everybody no  you're going down to Ground Zero.  Yeah.  It's not as, not as...  I think he's paying his respects,  but it's a little weird.  Yeah.  You think he got a tear up  when he's looking around?  Of course he did.  Hey, I'm getting a little choked up over here. 
[02:07:00]  I have no problem admitting  I went down there.  I bawled.  It's just amazing.  Well, we were in L.A.  Here's what pissed me off about it.  Is that people in L.A.  were like,  I'm not going to work.  Really?  You're in L.A.  and you're not going to work.  Yeah.  Look at the people there  that where it happened  are busting their ass.  Yeah.  You know, don't let these people...  Why isn't L.A. going to work?  Huh?  Why wouldn't L.A.  someone in L.A. go to work?  I know.  It happened.  Like, I called the crew.  I talked to my partners  and they said,  what do you want to do?  I said, well,  I think these guys  are putting out fires  and saving lives.  We should probably keep going.  Don't let these terrorists win it all.  You know,  and what the hell's going on  with terrorists?  You know,  any country that doesn't listen 
[02:07:30]  to their women  is going down.  Because you know,  Dan,  where there was some chick  that was serving them food  while they were playing  and that thing,  and she goes,  pardon me,  what did you say?  You're going to what?  No,  don't yell at me,  okay?  When your ass got lost  in the desert last year,  who got you to Jalalabad?  That was me,  my friend.  You know,  okay,  I'll say that before  you hit me with a stick,  but I want you to know  I only made you cold sandwiches  because you won't let me learn  to read a freaking recipe book.  That's another problem they got.  This whole sex angle,  right?  They cover their women up,  they put them in their robes, 
[02:08:00]  and they don't get to look  at attractive women.  No,  they don't get to look.  I think that loosens you up  a little bit.  I think so.  You know what,  if you're getting your junk waxed,  is that okay?  Very good.  I'm doing what I can't do.  You have the toughest,  edgiest radio station  in the country.  Junk waxed.  That's silly,  I know.  Hey,  Dice on the phone.  We used to say.  Dice on the phone.  Oh,  Dice,  Dice.  Well,  actually,  it's Happy Face.  Hang on,  hang on.  See,  Happy Face has to call for Dice. 
[02:08:30]  Okay,  now he's getting the legend.  What a crappy phone.  This gets so freaking old  after a while.  Who's Happy Face?  Dice.  Happy Face is the guy  that makes the call  for the legend,  and then he gets us  on the phone,  and then he hands the phone  over to the legend.  It's like a secretary.  I was on Dice's show,  by the way.  Dice's show.  Remember the show  he did when he was  a radio executive?  Oh,  I mean,  a record company executive?  Oh.  I'm ready to present you  with the legend.  All right,  I'm ready.  Present.  Okay,  here he is.  Are you ready?  Okay,  here we go. 
[02:09:00]  Hold on.  He was so close  to hanging up.  Yes,  Andrew.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Do you understand  I'm here with  the Salvation Army?  Yeah.  He's been here  since day one  at Ground Zero  taking care of things.  Right.  And you're bothering me  with this nonsense?  Yeah,  Dice,  we realize that.  We've been here  since September 11th.  Do you understand  there's nowhere  in New York  you could go  without getting  a ticket now?  What's that?  I'm with the police sergeant  and he told me so. 
[02:09:30]  Oh,  sure.  What day is this?  October 1st?  I got the complete police  Yeah,  right?  Looking for you.  It's September 30th  or something.  All of a sudden  Dice is down there.  Dice.  Yeah.  You could have  visited a lot sooner  than this.  The entire police department  is looking for you guys.  Right as we speak.  What is he talking about?  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  You're losing us.  What are you doing?  Wherever you park.  What are you doing?  I get ticketed.  What are you doing?  Wherever you walk  you get ticketed. 
[02:10:00]  What are you doing down there?  Do you understand  how it works?  I'm going to put on  special police operations  operations  Lieutenant  See how he goes.  Winklow.  Okay?  You just keep going.  You hear what I'm saying?  Not at all.  Dice.  Dice.  You hear me?  Everyone knows  we're pretty tight  with the NYPD.  Yeah,  I don't think  Andrew Dice Clay  is going to change  our relationship  with the NYPD.  I think it's already  been changed.  My friend,  I got it under control.  I got a hat.  Dice.  Give me a hat.  Do you understand?  Dice. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah,  okay.  What are you doing down there?  I want to put  the lieutenant on.  Why don't you let  the guys work?  Yeah,  I want him to talk to you.  No,  don't put the lieutenant on.  Why don't you just  let the guys do their job?  What are you doing down there?  Because he says  you're getting a ticket now.  What are you doing  down at Ground Zero?  What am I doing down there?  Why don't you let  the guys do their job?  I'm a lieutenant.  That's who I'm with.  I got the hat now.  I got the hat.  You understand?  You don't have the hat.  Let the guys do their job.  They've seen enough  disaster down there.  I'm with the Salvation Army. 
[02:11:00]  Right.  I'm with the lieutenant  and I got the hat.  Okay.  I think you're the last  celebrity to get  an NYPD hat,  by the way.  Holy ass.  I have to see  another celebrity  with an NYPD hat.  You have the FDNY hat  too?  Nice.  Stay there.  I'm all set now.  You have the FDNY hat?  I have to see  another Asian guy  that's obviously  not on the job  with an NYPD hat.  I'm going to kill myself.  Did they give you  a patch with the towers  and never forget?  I've got to talk  to somebody right now.  I'm going to put 
[02:11:30]  Happy on for a second.  No, don't put Happy on.  It's on for me.  Dice.  It's on for me.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  What happened?  He's having a nervous  breakdown, I think.  Happy face.  Yeah, this is Happy face.  Where is the legend?  The legend is taking care  of meeting and greeting people.  Meeting and greeting people.  Do you understand  that he's a legend  and everybody wants  to shake hands?  Absolutely.  There must be  at least nine people there.  Absolutely.  There are literally  hundreds of people  here right now  taking pictures  of his chiseled chin, 
[02:12:00]  admiring his dimples  and just wanting  to touch his body  because he is a legend.  Do you understand that?  Look at Christopher's face.  He has sold out  Madison Square Garden.  How is this looking  like Jesus Christ?  Did he sell it?  Right.  Every major arena  in the country.  Did he sell Madison Square Garden?  He has the olive garden.  He has a new special gift.  It's the garden.  Did he sell it  Madison Square Garden?  This is why he's a legend.  Christopher, stay human.  Okay?  See, this is your future  if you start to  happy face.  Start believing  your own face. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, happy face hung up.  He got a little upset.  All right.  Rick, call back happy face.  We need Dice to talk  because now Barry Williams  is on the other line.  Barry Williams?  Yeah.  Yes.  Danny Bonaduce.  No, no.  It's Greg Brady.  I know.  He's the guy who did  on the street.  Oh, yeah.  We got to talk to that.  Wasn't that great?  That was great.  Hey, Greg Brady.  Barry.  Hey.  No, the legend  is meeting people now.  He's meeting and greeting.  He's meeting and greeting  in the middle of Ground Zero.  We're very close  to getting both of you  on the phone at the same time.  I have a spectacular offer for him. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah, so you could ask Dice  if he wants to be part  of the next celebrity boxing thing.  You've got to get in the ring.  Barry wants Dice to fight a chick.  Well, not just a chick.  Who, who, who, who?  China.  China.  Oh, oh.  From the WWF.  All right, hold on.  We might have Dice back on the line here.  She goes for the junk, though.  Oh, yeah.  She does that punch.  It does.  Dice.  Dice.  No, this is Happy Face.  It's not Dice.  Happy, put on Dice, please.  I can't.  He's a legend.  He's taking care of things.  You understand that people  want to meet him?  No. 
[02:13:30]  No, see, obviously, you guys,  you think this is the problem.  I got, you know, I just can't.  I can't.  I got to go.  Happy Face.  Happy Face.  He's hanging up now.  He's hanging up now.  Oh.  Dice is hanging up.  All I can say, I mean,  I can't be sure,  but he's got to know  I'm on the line.  He's got to know  that this offer's coming.  And maybe he's ducking it.  Yeah, one more time, Rick.  That's what he's using.  Tell Happy Face  that Barry Williams,  the real Greg Brady,  wants to make Dice an offer.  We're trying to help Dice out.  Come on.  Yeah, like they help 
[02:14:00]  Vanilla Ice out,  the last celebrity boss.  Right.  Like they help.  The last celebrity  down at Ground Zero.  Who knew that Vanilla Ice  couldn't fight?  What are you talking about, Willis?  Did you see him bouncing around  like a goober?  He thought he was  in the prison shower again.  What was that?  He was fighting for his manhood.  Barry, did you watch it?  I mean, I tuned in late.  I didn't get to see you  and Danny, but Danny.  Barry was too busy  at the hospital trying to  wake up.  But that ain't fair, though,  because Bonaduce  is just training like every day.  I did like the other half  like two weeks before that.  But Barry's a friend of ours.  He's a martial artist.  We could have some fun with him.  He's a martial artist.  I wouldn't go in the ring 
[02:14:30]  with Don...  Bonaduce?  No way!  All that anger from his career  and then on top of  knowing martial arts, what?  You know what else he did?  He stopped taking his  mood-elevating drugs  about three weeks before.  Oh, he did.  He was totally zoned.  He pulled a Tyson.  Because we were talking  to a buddy of mine  as a martial arts instructor  and trained me in.  I got to tell you, man,  I don't know if I'd have  stepped in the ring with him.  You had a lot of guts, man.  A lot of guts.  Who knew Greg Brady?  Johnny Bravo.  Do you hate being called  Greg Brady, man?  Does it just bug you?  No, I prefer Keith Partridge.  We have Christopher Titus 
[02:15:00]  in the studio, Barry.  Yeah, I know.  I have a fan.  Yeah, I wasn't sure.  Me too, man.  I mean, you know,  I grew up on you.  Barry has fully accepted  the fact that he will...  I've embodied it.  Yeah.  And he's actually  done a great job  having fun with it.  He put out an album  with Johnny Bravo.  Yep.  A Johnny Bravo album,  which we play...  It's part of what I'm  touring with right now  with the monkey.  Now, Barry,  do you put the jacket on,  the little vest?  I do when I do Johnny's back  and the shade.  Johnny's back. 
[02:15:30]  I'm ready to rock  you down tonight.  Yeah.  I can't get the picture  of Dice out of my mind.  With the big NYPD hat on.  The last guy.  Actually, he's the second  to last because I believe  Carrot Top is going to  make his way down  to ground zero  to complete the entire  celebrity gamut.  All right.  At least Emo Phillips  went early.  Dice.  Who do you want?  What happened?  We want Andrew Dice Clay,  please.  You want the American legend?  We need him to speak  with Barry Williams  who is on the phone  with us right now. 
[02:16:00]  Happy face,  we'd like to speak  to the funniest comic  of all time,  the American legend,  Andrew Dice Clay.  All right.  You see,  other people know  he's a legend.  I'm telling you.  All right.  We're not denying it, man.  Let's all calm down.  We're trying to do  a radio show here  and we've got to move on.  The legend of Pips.  Let's get...  Okay, well, hang on.  The legend just may be ready now.  Hang on.  All right.  Okay, here he is.  Oh, thank God.  Andrew Dice Clay.  Opie.  Dice.  Opie, do you understand?  I'm on with Tom Kennedy.  We're talking about hats.  We're saying I'm over here.  This is how friendly we are. 
[02:16:30]  He's over somewhere  and I'm over here.  Oh, my God.  Can we talk like that  to each other?  Can we just please...  And he's going...  I don't see...  Please, can I pray...  Please, can one more  piece of debris just fall?  Something that was  precariously perched  on the top  of one of the buildings  that...  Please, one more  piece of debris.  One brick.  That's all we need.  Very well...  I don't see ONA  walking around with the hat.  Hey, Dice.  Dice.  I went down to Ground Zero  three weeks after the event  by myself 
[02:17:00]  in the middle of the night.  No one knew I was there.  He says to me,  we give you the hat.  Not ONA.  He's going with the hat.  All right, Dice.  We have Greg...  Tom Kennedy gave me the hat  with the lieutenant.  I understand.  Dice, we have  the real Greg Brady  on the line.  Right.  Barry Williams from...  You remember Barry?  Yeah, he's not Barry.  He's very nice.  With a proposition  for you and your fine career.  No, but the thing is  with Barry,  he don't got the hat either.  Dice, Dice, Dice,  I'm not with the hat.  You know, the hat 
[02:17:30]  bit's a little old.  I'm going down here.  Tom Kennedy,  and the lieutenant.  All right.  We understand.  Dice, Dice.  Here's Barry Williams, Dice.  Let me talk to you  for just a second.  First of all,  I've been down a free time.  I'm talking about something.  Listen, it's a very patriotic thing  that you're doing down there.  Now, when you think about  what went on,  it gets you mad, doesn't it?  Who am I talking to?  Barry Williams, you dick.  Tell him what you said.  I'm not in show business right now.  Right now, I am down. 
[02:18:00]  Stop listening.  Ground Zero with the lieutenant.  In the hat.  I know, in the hat.  In the hat.  The whole Kennedy clan is it.  Carlos Shesky.  Well, whatever.  Look, I know a lot of the people  that work down at the site  at Ground Zero.  I know a lot of them  listen to the show.  Could you please,  one of the crane operators,  could you just lower  something heavy on Dice?  Please, right now.  He's standing right there.  Lower one of those  big toolbox things.  Or one of those  big wrecking balls. 
[02:18:30]  Just drop it on Dice.  Please drop it on Dice.  Or pick him up  and dump him in the river.  Could you just dump him?  Move the boom on over.  Dump him in the Hudson.  Could you please  just dump him in the river?  Just lift him up in the air  a few hundred feet.  Please.  Make it look like an accident.  Barry.  Barry.  Barry.  Andrew Dice Clay.  Barry Williams.  Please speak with  Andrew Dice Clay.  Dice, I just want to say  that I think it's great  what you're doing down there,  but it has to get you mad 
[02:19:00]  when you think about  what happened.  It doesn't do.  And call you with an offer.  Gets us mad that the  Port Authority Police Department  doesn't get enough.  Oh, who is this now?  Much work we've been  doing down here.  Oh, Christ on a pony.  Where is Dice?  Get Dice.  Dice is standing by  with us,  shoulder to shoulder  with the Port Authority  Police Department, sir.  Why do you have to be  on the phone  to try to get more credit?  We all know the Port Authority  lost...  Oh, I hate this crap.  Get Dice on the phone. 
[02:19:30]  All right, all right.  Calm down, man.  Dude, let it go for a second.  If you get this putz off  and put somebody on  who's reputable, okay?  Then I'll put Dice on.  Get Dice on the phone.  Put Dice on the phone.  I'll explain it in a minute.  I'm so sick of people  that are pissed off  because they're not  getting enough credit.  Well, that's...  With this whole  ground zero thing.  Hey, look at this.  It's a tax.  I know.  That's not credit, sir.  It's simply a matter  of getting the information out.  I'm going to put Dice on  and then I'm sending  20 cops down  to lock your ass up.  Put Dice on.  I don't understand 
[02:20:00]  why you have to call  to try to get credit  for a job that you're doing.  Obviously,  I should be the one  that's the mayor  at this point.  Oh, God.  If you make a visit  down here,  I'm coming down with this...  Make him the mayor  and then please,  can we have the first mayor  of New York assassinated?  Please.  I'm coming down  with 20 cops.  That's making me yearning  for my family.  Dice.  And you're going to get  twist and sentence.  Dice.  What do you think?  I'm a moron.  Barry, Barry,  instead of trying  to get him  in the spirit of it,  I think you're going  to have to go  directly to the offer. 
[02:20:30]  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Nobody believes in it.  Dice.  Dice.  I am there  with the Kennedys  and the...  Oh, my God.  Dice.  Barry Williams  has an offer  for television for you.  Money.  I'm here with  the Kennedys  and Winslow.  Do you understand?  Help your fame.  There will be money.  Lieutenant and Winslow.  Oh, my dear  sweet Jesus.  He's nice to period.  Here's what I answer to.  Dice.  Oh, my God.  Dice.  Christopher Titus here.  Dice.  Who's there?  Christopher Titus.  How you doing, man? 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  You don't know, cop.  I am a police  and a law officer.  I get it, man.  Look, Barry Williams  has an offer.  He's having a nervous breakdown.  He is definitely  having a nervous breakdown.  We are listening to Dice  in the midst  of a nervous breakdown.  Let's all just sit back  and listen.  Perhaps seeing Ground Zero  was the last straw  snapped him like a twig.  I have work to do  in the city.  I drive around  in a Lincoln old school.  Dice, you're having  a nervous breakdown.  Seek help.  You don't even know 
[02:21:30]  what you're talking about.  I will arrest you  and put you in jail  and I will have  Lieutenant Winslow  send you with  Judge Kennedy.  You understand  what I can have done now?  Dice, you're a madman.  There is Bloomberg.  We is bad back Bloomberg.  I want to talk to the mayor.  You know what I mean?  I'm seeing sodas down here.  I'm seeing open bottles  of water.  I want to see good stuff.  I highly recommend  you see Dice  at the Beacon Theater tonight  because I truly believe  it will be the last time  he'll be on a stage.  We got to entertain 
[02:22:00]  the boys no more.  Dice, Dice,  I think  shaking their boobs  and their big stuff.  I think hawking  for the workers down there  is pretty much done with.  You know,  they're getting everything  they need.  Maybe if you were there  in October,  maybe if you were in New York  during the event  and in the months  following it,  you would understand  what was going on  instead of being  the self-centered guy  that you are.  Dice,  I'm running the city now.  I will bring the city 
[02:22:30]  back to the greatness  that we once were.  Hey, Dice, Dice,  Dice, Dice,  Dice,  why didn't you just wait  until the buildings  were built back up?  Why didn't you wait  until they just  built the buildings again  and then show up?  I am so glad.  Lieutenant Bloomberg  and Captain  Lieutenant Winslow.  Hey, Dice,  why don't you go  to Pearl Harbor?  I hear something horrible  happened there  a while ago.  Help those people.  You live in the  real middle world.  Jesus, Dice,  go to Cape Canaveral. 
[02:23:00]  I hear one of the  shuttles exploded.  Go down there.  Pay your respects.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  Holy Christ.  What is he talking about?  On the air,  as long as you abide  by the rules of lies,  people who work  on the main,  the police people  in the sea.  Dice, Dice,  go to the harbor.  The Titanic was  supposed to come in,  but it sank.  Pay your respects.  There's nothing here.  Hey,  these people need  warm clothes.  The survivors 
[02:23:30]  of the Titanic,  they need warm clothes.  Help them out here.  I'm here with the people  from White Star Lines.  The White Star Lines,  people,  had a hard time.  Their ship sank,  and these people  to survive is a cold.  They need blankets.  Send them down there.  I'm going to Jersey.  I'm going to Lakehurst, New Jersey.  I hear a blimp exploding.  The people are hurt.  They need help and support.  The Hindenburg.  Oh, the humanity.  I can't look. 
[02:24:00]  Holy Jesus.  My God.  It's unbelievable.  That was...  Barry?  Yeah.  We were close that time.  We should mention...  We were close.  We were pretty close.  This might not be  the most opportune moment.  I'm not sure.  He has lost his mind.  He's having...  O'Leary's cow  burnt down Chicago.  Please,  people need homes.  Please,  people need homes.  By the way,  I don't...  Typhoid Mary's  killing everyone.  By the way,  I don't want anyone  to confuse what I was saying,  but it really pisses off  Ant and I  when people feel like 
[02:24:30]  they have to call the media,  you know,  radio stations,  TV,  to try to get more credit.  We understand the tragedy.  Believe me.  What to...  Believe me.  And this isn't the first  or second time  this has happened,  you know?  Yeah.  So if you work for  the Port Authority,  it wasn't a stab at you,  but I can't believe  the guy's,  you know,  calling and trying to get  more credit  for the Port Authority.  The Midwest is in a dust bowl.  They're in a dust bowl.  They need our help.  It's a big drought.  Hey, Dice,  I hear there's a hurricane  coming off of Florida.  Yeah,  it's Hurricane Andrew. 
[02:25:00]  Please hurry.  Help.  Gah!  I don't think anybody  doubts your respect  for the Port Authority.  Crack of tower.  It's erupting.  The people of Pompeii.  They're all stuck in Iraq  over here.  Oh, my God.  They need your help.  At least you made it funny.  I got the hat.  I got the Mount St. Helens hat.  Run for your lives, people.  Run for your lives.  Mount St. Helens  erupted. 
[02:25:30]  Run for your little...  Look,  I got the Washington  State Police hat.  I'm here with Officer Kennedy.  Mount St. Helens,  run, people.  Look at the ash.  I'm the biggest ash here.  I'm an ash hole.  Well,  you know,  he's a fellow comic, people,  so I'm just going to sit here quiet.  Of course.  No,  as a fellow comic,  everyone could go fund ice.  But he's on it.  I've never heard him  that out of his mind.  He is completely...  He lost his mind somewhere.  Yeah.  Christopher, 
[02:26:00]  has it been going for a while?  Yeah, yeah.  Ever since we've been  doing this program.  Wow.  He's lost his mind somewhere.  Remember,  he come up on stage,  you know,  hickory-dickory-dog,  you know,  he do his things  and his cigarette smoke.  I'm on the line  with this chick  at the bank  and she's got a tongue.  Oh!  Yeah, now,  he does what you just heard.  He babbles incoherent.  You don't even know  what he's talking about.  Yes!  Oh, you guys aren't actually  helping the ticket sales  at the Beacon Theater.  No, no, absolutely.  The place will be  packed tonight 
[02:26:30]  because it could be  his last show ever.  Because you will see a man  having a nervous breakdown tonight.  You will see a man  having a nervous breakdown  at the Beacon.  I know MTV wants to take advantage  of that whole  Ozzy Osbourne show.  Kennedy's been shot!  Kennedy's been shot!  MTV should follow  Dice around with cameras.  There's your next hit,  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  See the real Dice  when he's not on the stage.  It's kind of sad.  Greg Brady.  I think the first episode  should be down  to Ground Zero with him. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, man.  That seems to be  a touchstone for him.  Barry.  Next album.  Ground Zero with Dice.  I think that's  the next album.  All I could do  is apologize, Barry.  I actually thought,  silly me,  please hit me  with a goddamn  ball-peen hammer  in the head.  I thought he would  shut up for enough time  where you could actually  get a word in it.  At least fill out the offer.  Yeah.  And we all,  we definitely don't want  to ever forget  what happened.  Right.  But I felt like  it was like October 1st.  A little self-service.  For the last half hour.  I've been sitting over here 
[02:27:30]  thinking maybe Christopher  would like to put on the gloves.  Man, you know what?  I still have a show.  It's not a has-been, Barry.  I still have a show  on television.  Hey, right?  Maybe after.  10 years.  No, no, no.  10 years from now.  Let's talk.  My career is on fire again now.  It is, man.  You handled it well, dude.  He was,  he's like a fighter.  Yeah, Barry.  You did a good job, man.  That's not a low blow.  More people call me Barry now  than ever in my life.  That's true, right?  That's you, Ant.  That's not a low blow.  I wish I had half the career  you had, my friend.  Yeah. 
[02:28:00]  And half the gash.  That's right.  My God, he got some Marsha Brady.  All right, Tom.  Yeah.  Barry, do we hang up on you  and if we get dice back,  do we try to call you?  Barry, like he doesn't have  something to do.  I'll be listening with faded breath.  All right.  Hey.  All right.  Go get a hat.  The offer is still there.  Christopher, we should talk.  Oh, yeah, definitely.  All right, man.  Thank you, Barry.  See you, guys.  All right.  It's like the hat got one laugh  and then he just couldn't go.  And then he,  that's what he does.  Oh, my God, man.  He got a laugh  and it's like to stay.  He wants to annoy you. 
[02:28:30]  You should see him.  If you go to the Deacon tonight,  he will go up to some guy  and go,  look what color pants you're wearing.  Beige.  And then he'll go off  for 20 minutes  on the guy's beige pants.  You want to run up onto the stage  and punch him in the face.  Wow.  Punch me.  By the way,  this is the guy  who's like on your team.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Isn't that sad?  I'm glad I'm not.  I'll be calling you  like three years crazy  from L.A.  Just insane.  Just ranting.  Insane.  Dice having a nervous breakdown. 
[02:29:00]  And this is just in.  Dice is jumping on a plane.  He's going to go  to Oklahoma City.  I hear they got a problem  with a building.  Blew up.  There was people.  Oh, save the children.  Save the children.  I'm asking everyone  send diapers  for the children.  And then he's heading  over to Columbine.  Oh, my God.  There's a problem there.  We got to save the kids.  I got a hat.  Hat makes everything okay,  I think.  I'm looking for  the Lindbergh baby.  I'm looking for 
[02:29:30]  the Lindbergh baby.  Charles Lindbergh  needs help  finding the baby.  There's a ladder  out his window  so much taller than his baby.  He's an American hero.  I got a Lindbergh hat.  I got a Lindbergh.  Oh, man.  Well, uh...  The red coats are coming.  The red coats are coming.  Oh, do it by land,  what if I see?  The ring is by head.  Goddamn, Dice, man. 
[02:30:00]  Nothing funny  than him losing  his friggin' mind.  Engines are coming.  Custer, look out.  Watch your scalp, Custer.  You daffy bastard.  You put your hat on.  Put your hat on  so they can't scalp you.  Hey, it's Dice here.  No, it's not.  Don't worry.  It's no Trojan horse  or nothing.  Yeah.  Dice here.  Open the door.  Open the door.  I got a hat.  It's the Trojan hat. 
[02:30:30]  Well, I hear  Rock Hudson is sick, huh?  What is it?  A flu?  She got the flu bug.  I love watching him  have a nervous breakdown.  It's perfect.  Hey, Kennedy, talk.  Kennedy, look out.  I think, wow.  Hey, Adam, don't...  That was really fun.  It was a lot of fun.  Yeah, you got it  when you're hearing somebody  actually having a nervous breakdown. 
[02:31:00]  To wrap it up,  go right to the beginning.  Hey, Adam, don't eat that apple.  Adam, what are you doing?  Eve's going to bite it  and we'll have  eternal damnation  or something.  There's a snake.  He's the snake.  Don't listen to the snake.  Snake.  Cut the snake.  I'll make the skin  into a hat.  Eve, what a hooah.  Yes.  She's a hooah.  She's going to ruin it  for everybody.  Hey, Noah,  build the ark.  It's raining.  It's going to be  drowning here, people.  Put on a rain hat.  All right, man. 
[02:31:30]  That was probably  one of the best  improv radio bits I've seen.  Thank you.  I've done a lot of radio, man,  and that was really funny.  And it's sad  that I wasn't involved in it.  Moving on.  Whatever.  Well, what happened?  Is he on medication?  He should be.  What happened?  The guy should be.  Guys, I'm not kidding.  I'm like...  I'm so glad.  He's a fellow comic,  so I'm like,  dude, what happened?  I'm so glad you know.  I need some Paxil.  Maybe some Thorazine.  I think he's convinced  it's funny or something. 
[02:32:00]  We don't know.  We don't know what he...  We don't know what he does.  We don't understand  what he's going for.  And Christopher,  we've talked about this.  Repeating the same joke  over and over.  It's not funny.  It's Bonneville.  Right.  Vaudiaville.  We've talked about this.  It's Vaudiaville in the past.  I'm not kidding.  I'm in New York.  I don't mean to rip dice,  but I mean, it's like...  Right.  We've talked about this,  though.  Me and Obi sit there  and go,  why does he call up  and just go on and on  in the head?  He keeps going.  You want to reach  into the phone  and pull his head out 
[02:32:30]  and punch him.  And someone has  a Big Bang joke  on like...  That's great.  What are you doing?  Big Bang.  Big Bang.  And they made the universe.  It's in constant motion.  It ain't ending.  You know,  because you could say  if it's never ending,  what's at the end of it?  Let's say there's a hat.  What's beyond the hat?  Another hat!  Oh! 
[02:33:00]  Anthony.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Oh, man.  He's like freaking  the Nostradamus of comedians.  He's doing comedy  in Quatrain.  Isn't he amazing?  But it's the same  Quatrain over and over.  We're hanging  with Christopher Titus.  Man.  Very funny, guys.  This has been the oddest...  I've never...  It's just been an odd show.  You guys should brought me on.  There's a girl  that's been molested  by this 97-year-old guy.  Hey, we have Dice  flipped out on the phone.  Dice having a nervous  prank test.  You know,  yeah, trust me,  the show's funny.  Maybe you didn't hear it today, 
[02:33:30]  but I promise.  You know what?  Ask, he saw it.  He saw it.  Very funny.  We might have to replay  what we did to Linda Lovelace's  older sister.  Oh, jeez.  Please.  We forgot that happened today.  Christopher Titus coming in.  More tragedy.  More tragedy  and painful yelling.  Come on.  Every time I'm...  No, not at all.  You're having fun, right?  Oh, yes.

[03:41:00]  I  I  I  To show our appreciation for so much power, we keep having it packed with fresh souls.  God was here before the Marine Corps, so you could give your heart to Jesus, but your ass belongs to the Corps.  You're not part of the Marines.  I feel like it.  I'd love to go over there.  Look out, look out.  I'll throw my body on a hand grenade. 
[03:41:30]  For my brother, Marine, Marine, Marine, Marine.  I mean, I love the military.  Even though I'm 61 years old, it doesn't matter.  I would just love to get in there and get a piece of the action.  Get Osama's ass.  Why don't you go in the caves and try to hunt them?  I'll do that.  I'll be a tunnel rat.  Here I am, Tom Brokaw.  I'm in the tunnels here in Afghanistan, and I'm ready to kick some ass. 
[03:42:00]  Come on out, Osama.  Come on, I see you.  I see you.  I didn't start this.  I didn't draw first blood.  I'm just sorry to this.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Adrian!  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know the fighting movie.  What are you doing?  Sticks to the regular movie.  That's Rambo.  Yeah, blow them up.  Sand monkeys.  I'll kill all the sand monkeys. 
[03:42:30]  There you go.  Kiss my ass.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  I can't wait to get over there.  I cannot wait to get over there.  You f***ing tools.  Rather.  Rather.  I'm going to give you three seconds.  Exactly three f***ing seconds.  Swipe that stupid looking grin off your face.  Or I will gouge out your eyeballs and skull f*** you. 
[03:43:00]  Whoa!  The answer to that one.  You pussy boy, rather.  Rather, you best on f*** yourself and start f*** me Tiffany Conflinks or I will definitely f*** you up.  Rather, you will give your rifle a girl's name because this is the only f*** you people are going to get.  Your days of f*** banging old Mary Jane Rotten Crotch through her pretty big panties are over. 
[03:43:30]  Rather.  I just love being there.  I can smell it.  Smell it.  Smell it.  Smell it in the air.  Can you?  I can't say it.  But I can smell it.  Let me hear you pronounce Taliban, Tom. 
[03:44:00]  The bad guys.  That's how absolutely Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  This ain't your show, Elias.  You sound motivated, Mr. Brokaw.  Well, I am.  Yeah.  Rather was full of s***.  Rather was a crusader.  Now, I ain't got no problem with a man who does what he's told.  But when he don't, the machine breaks down.  And when the machine breaks down, we break down. 
[03:44:30]  And I ain't going to let that happen from any of you.  Not one.  Looks like Mr. Brokaw watched a lot of movies on the train back from Boston.  I have no idea what you're talking about.  You've got a lot of DVDs in your back pocket, huh, Mr. Brokaw?  Well, I'm inspired.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News is inspired.  Yeah.  By victories of the Americans in the past. 
[03:45:00]  I was interviewed here.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News live from Afghanistan.  Tom, how do you lead the women and children?  No, it's how can you shoot innocent women and children?  The answer, easy, you just don't lead them as well.  If they run, they're VC.  If they stand still, they're well-disciplined VC. 
[03:45:30]  Rather, get your boots on.  And the next time I catch you spraying Skeeter repellent on your feet, I'm going to court-martial your nigger ass.  Long time.  Can't say that on the Nightly News.  Out in the field, when death is around the corner, you say what you want.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News. 
[03:46:00]  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there.  Thank you for calling.  This is Tom just speaking.  How may I help you?  I stayed in your hotel in Niagara Falls about a month ago.  I was on my honeymoon and stuff.  And, well, I stole a few items.  And, well, recently I found God and I'm feeling a little guilty about it.  Hold on.  Let me transfer you to corporate services.  Okay.  Corporate Service Group, my name is Dean. 
[03:46:30]  And I understand there's a matter of some items from one of our hotels?  Well, I stole some items while I was staying at the in the Niagara Falls region.  Okay.  And I found God recently and I'm feeling a little guilty about it.  Okay.  I stole the bottle of shampoo and conditioner and the free shower cap and hand lotion.  Okay.  And a couple of the towels.  As far as the consumables, the shower cap, the shampoo and conditioner, et cetera, those items are for your use and you are free to take those with you if you'd like. 
[03:47:00]  As far as the towels, they do ask that you don't take the towels with you if you'd like to return.  I can provide the address for the hotel and you can send it to them.  Well, I wish I stopped there, but I didn't.  I also stole the coffee maker and we were going on a long trip, so I figured I needed the blankets and pillows.  Okay.  Those items should be returned to the hotel.  I can offer you that address.  And the sheets because they got a little messy.  I was embarrassed to leave them behind. 
[03:47:30]  You said you stayed at the Niagara Falls?  Well, I'm a little nervous, so I don't really want to give too much info at this time.  Well, I don't even have your name, sir, and there are several hundred people that stay in that hotel a day.  And I can provide you that address without ever knowing your name.  You can send it to them anonymously.  Well, I also stole the lamp and the TV remote.  I'm sure the management would appreciate those items being returned.  And the fax machine.  I feel a little better that I'm at least telling somebody about this.  And would you like to return the items to the hotel? 
[03:48:00]  I needed some money, so I sold them.  I still have the love seat and the curtains that I stole, but that's about it.  All right.  And you might notice in room 302 that the TV doesn't work too well because I was trying to yank it out of the wall.  And I don't know, there's a loose connection or something.  I also stole some of the toilet paper from the maid's cart, but I figured that was just free.  Yes, sir.  That's an item you're free to use as you wish.  Would you like to return the items that you still have?  I would need to know which hotel so I can offer you that address. 
[03:48:30]  Yeah, well, honestly, I still have the soda machine.  I was a bitch to get out of the hotel.  Hello?  Yes, sir.  Hi.  I'm just trying to get all this off my chest.  The only way for me to help you, sir, is to provide you with the appropriate address for the hotel that these items belong to.  Would you like that address?  And if so, which hotel was it?  Well, if I told you, it would be very obvious because we also took one of the courtesy buses on a little joyride. 
[03:49:00]  It wasn't easy to get the ice machine in that.  But I guess I just needed to tell someone this.  I really can't afford to actually replace the items.  Hello?  Yes.  I mean, I could possibly turn the couch, I guess.  It's still in my living room.  How much do you think all these items would cost?  That I do not know as far as how much an ice machine costs.  I do not know.  I can offer you the address of the hotel, and that would offer you an outlet to return the items you still have.  Well, actually, I could use that address because Consuelo, the maid, she's going to need to find her way back to the hotel. 
[03:49:30]  Well, I kidnapped her, and I let her go today.  She was in the basement for a month.  All right, this is a song that I think it's going to replace a certain other song that we know and love, but I don't get a chance to play it very often.  Oh, the Special Olympics song?  Maybe that song.  Okay.  I don't know.  So I kind of wrote a different version of that song. 
[03:50:00]  So don't call in and tell me that I'm ripping myself off.  Because I already know it, all right?  This is about a childhood friend named Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed. 
[03:50:30]  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed. 
[03:51:00]  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  special. We'd play tag and he'd get hurt. I'd play soldier, he'd eat dirt. I liked math  and a spelling bee. Ed liked talking to a trio special and mama dropped him on his 
[03:51:30]  head. Now she keeps him in the shed. Cause he's a little bit special. A little bit special.  I ran track, hung out in malls. Ed ran head first into walls. I had girls and lots of 
[03:52:00]  clothes. Ed had names for all his toes. Oh, special and mama dropped him on his head. Now  he thinks he's a piece of bread. He's a little bit special. Just a little bit special. 
[03:52:30]  One day talking to special Ed, he grabbed a brick and he swung in my head. And as he laughed  at me, that's when I knew special Ed just made me special too.  Now I laugh as I count bugs. I give strangers great big hugs. Next to me, Ed is fine. He's a 
[03:53:00]  a f***ing Einstein. Oh, special Ed in me. Now we're not right in the head, you see. Now we're not so  bright instead. We're a little bit special. Just a little bit special. That bastard Ed made me special. 
[03:53:30]  Just a little bit special.  Just a little bit special.  All right. There's the steam and let you know and love. There's some redemption.  Please forgive me.

Hey, Opie and Anthony, he snubbed us when we were in Philly. But oh well, what the hell.  Cousin Ed rocks. He's up next.  On 94 WISP.  Are you the parent of a college student? If so, then you should be aware that college students lie.  When they tell you they were out late because they were at the library, that's a lie.  When they say they've never heard of a fake ID, that's a big fat lie. 
[03:54:30]  The reason we're pointing all this out is because IKEA is hosting our college Cribs event.  And with all the affordable prices, it's a prime opportunity for, you guessed it, lying.  For instance, if your college kid calls you up and says they need $900 to buy a sofa, they're lying.  There are couches at IKEA for $199.  Or when they say they need $400 for a desk, they're lying.  We have desks for $39. That's right, $39.  We only tell you this because, as a parent, you're going to get lied to.  Just not on our watch. 
[03:55:00]  The IKEA College Cribs event, July 29th through August 11th.  Visit IKEA at Plymouth Meeting Mall or shop by phone at 1-800-434-IKEA.  Or visit IKEA.com.  Some products require assembly.
