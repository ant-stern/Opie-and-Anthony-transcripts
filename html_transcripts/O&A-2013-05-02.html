<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts' typical vulgar and sexually explicit banter. Opie recounted a frustrating experience with his sick son and an unresponsive pediatrician, contrasting it with the helpfulness of a friend, Dr. Steve, while criticizing the medical profession's communication. Anthony shared a negative doctor experience.  The main focus quickly shifted to their outrage over SiriusXM's unannounced move of their show to channel 103, expressing concerns about losing listeners due to the lack of promotion and placement near the explicit "Radio Sex" channel.  They contrasted this with the favorable treatment of a new Entertainment Weekly channel placed on channel 105, a position they'd been told was unattainable.  Several listener calls echoed their frustration with the channel change and SiriusXM's customer service. The hosts vowed to stop attending meetings due to the perceived disrespect.  Upcoming events like a Montreal trip and bus tour were discussed, with skepticism about their successful execution.

The frustration with SiriusXM's handling of the channel move continued, with the hosts expressing anger and disbelief at the lack of promotional materials and management's perceived incompetence, using frequent expletives.  They detailed the sexually explicit and bizarre nature of the programming on the adjacent channels, highlighting the poor quality of their descriptions.  Mark Maron then joined the show. He recounted a sexual encounter with Margaret Cho after a 25-year friendship, detailing the event and Cho's subsequent on-stage comments about his penis size.  The conversation expanded to open relationships, podcasting's evolution (with Maron highlighting his pioneering role), his career shift away from overtly political commentary, his struggles with hypochondria, and experiences with prostitutes.  Maron promoted his book and IFC show.

The show then focused on patent trolls targeting podcasters, particularly Adam Corolla and Sam Seder.  Opie and Anthony expressed anger at the perceived extortion, calling the patent holders "mobsters," and mentioned contacting the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) for advice.  The conversation returned to Mark Maron, who discussed a revealing Fiona Apple interview and the challenges of interviewing unconventional musicians like Jay Mascus from Dinosaur Jr.  Maron mentioned his book, *Attempting Normal*, and apologized for past fan attacks on Opie and Anthony. Stephen Lynch then joined, discussing his new album, *Lion*, his three-year hiatus, and his home life challenges with historical preservation regulations.  He and the hosts engaged in a recurring comedic bit about "queer tattoos," and Lynch's band performed a couple of songs.

Stephen Lynch's musical segment continued, focusing on his music, including a song with the word "fuck" and the discussion of a potential radio-friendly version. They reminisced about past radio stunts and the changes in radio regulations following listener incidents. Lynch performed a song about veganism with profane and humorous lyrics.  Sir Ben Kingsley then made a surprise in-studio appearance.  The interview covered his knighthood, acting methods, *Iron Man 3*, his early career connection to Brian Epstein, and the hostsâ€™ opinions on a Tony Siragusa Depends commercial.  They briefly touched upon the Washington Redskins name controversy, the Boston Marathon bombing suspects' arrest, and a video camera technical issue. The segment concluded with a discussion of *Jaws* and Kingsley unexpectedly knighting Sam Roberts.

The show resumed with a discussion of the previous Ben Kingsley encounter.  The hosts then reacted to Carly Rae Jepsen's unexpected presence in the building, speculating on a conspiracy. Sam Roberts called in, confirming his likely move to channel 103 pending contract negotiations.  The hosts and Sam discussed Mother's Day plans, leading to a commercial break for Steven Singer Jewelers, highlighting "IHateStevenSinger.com."  Listener calls congratulated Sam on his (fictional) knighthood by Ben Kingsley, jokingly requesting his help with various tasks.  The hosts discussed their childhood understanding of "homosexual" based on *Clue*.  A significant portion was dedicated to a conflict between Troy, the intern supervisor, and Alan Thicke Jr., the intern, regarding Alan's work ethic, lateness, and failure to deliver audio clips. Sal intervened, escalating the conflict, which concluded with Alan's disrespectful comment about Eric's burial.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Greg Audio!  Antonio!  Ooh!  Good morning, I'm Christopher Lloyd and I'm standing here at the studios of Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  It's a weekly morning approximately 6am and this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme. 
[00:00:30]  Opie! Opie! Opie! Opie! Opie!  Sue Vulgar.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  Sue, the last year.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it started.  Like rotten egg from Sue.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting. 
[00:01:00]  ONA every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed.  And conventions burn the crowd.  Would you like to make some fucking second?  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Betty White's ass.  She's 90, right?  It doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony, the rage. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, fuck, how much more fair you wanted?  Fire these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to help.  Fuck you!  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, hardy horn should go off.  Surprise!  This is Opie and Anthony's show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double gun, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Exactly. 
[00:02:00]  All right.  Good morning, everyone.  Hi, everybody.  How's everybody, body?  Oh, Jesus.  You're asking me.  You're asking me.  Yeah, huh?  You're asking me.  Yeah, huh?  Nothing worse than dealing with a sick kid.  It's bad enough when you're sick.  Yeah.  But a sick kid, fuck.  That sucks, man.  These fucking parents out there, we got a lot of parents that listen to us.  How about you warn me about some of these things?  Oh, I kind of remember they did over time.  Over the course of time. 
[00:02:30]  Well, my son's gonna be three very, very soon.  And in general, he's had basic illnesses, you know, sog, stuffy nose, cold.  But these kids, they, you know, they get better in 12 hours.  It's really fucking creepy how quick they heal.  You can watch cuts and bruises actually heal in front of you.  It's really fucking strange.  Like Wolverine.  Yeah, like Wolverine.  But he finally got hit with, like, some fucking real virus, 104.5 temperature,  which basically means, you know, you gotta get him to the emergency room 
[00:03:00]  or get that fever down immediately.  And we were able to get it down to about 103.  Wow.  How do you do that?  Aspirines?  A lot of aspirine.  A lot of aspirine.  Damn.  And so what?  This is Thursday.  So Tuesday night, I had every intention of coming in here yesterday.  Yeah.  But I was up all fucking night with him as he's just whining and crying and fucking bitching  about management. 
[00:03:30]  Was it weird to hear a three-year-old say video elements?  Right.  I'm like, damn, that's how I sound?  I gotta shut the fuck up.  Now I get it.  And holding him all night, waking up every fucking 20 minutes, his voice is going,  his throat is raspy.  A three-year-old with a raspy voice is really fucking straight.  So then, of course, you call your pediatrician.  That's why I love Dr. Steve.  I know him.  We have a friend, Dr. Steve, Weird Medicine.  We beat the shit out of him, but he's like a real fucking doctor that I wish every single 
[00:04:00]  person, even the haters, had in their life.  That's great, right?  Because he fucking takes it seriously.  He'll take your phone call, and he'll talk you off the ledge with this basic sick shit.  But we call our pediatrician all night long, 104.  Someone's got to get back to us.  What do we do?  Do we go to the emergency room?  Blah, blah, blah.  But through Dr. Steve, I knew I didn't have to go to the emergency room.  Just watch it, and keep giving them aspirin, right?  Six o'clock, seven o'clock in the morning, no fucking call from their pediatrician still. 
[00:04:30]  I'm paying you, not Dr. Steve.  So at eight in the morning, I let you guys know I wasn't going to come in.  And eight in the morning, I'm waiting at the pediatrician's office, because that's when  they opened, so they can finally see my sick kid.  And then they're annoyed, because I don't have an appointment.  I'm like, sorry, but I've been up all fucking night.  Look at the kid.  He's in rough shape here.  This isn't like a regular sniffles.  Yeah.  It's obviously, this is a little more than usual.  So long story short, they got him in, and they gave him a strep test, and he doesn't 
[00:05:00]  have strep, but he's still fucking miserable with a really bad sore throat.  He's got it real bad.  He's got a real bad virus.  But my point is, this is the worst one he's had in his little three-year life.  And the medical profession really is annoying.  It's annoying.  It's a hard job.  But Dr. Steve is honestly a good doctor.  He really does want to know that you're doing okay, and he takes time to talk to you.  And he's a really good doctor.  Why aren't there more doctors like this?  Our Russian doctor. 
[00:05:30]  I stopped going to her because she's a creep.  She'll fucking give you the worst case scenario, and then downplay the fact that, oh, but that's  probably not what it is.  I told you, I had an EKG, and I go, what is it reading?  And she goes, as casual as possible, she goes, heart attack.  And then I'm waiting.  She goes, I go, heart attack?  She goes, oh, yeah, but this machine has been acting up.  You fucking piece of shit.  But when you say, like, the machine's been acting up, it's reading heart attack, but it's 
[00:06:00]  not a heart attack.  In the end, it wasn't a heart attack.  Oh, my God.  But I go, what is it reading?  She goes, heart attack.  And then there's nothing after that to explain, but.  What a fucking, oh, that's terrible.  I fucking hate doctors.  Most people hate doctors.  I know we have doctors listening to us, but you just suck.  Yeah.  You know, you got a whole bunch of panicky Pete's, and you don't know how to talk to  them.  So Dr. Steve is a fucking hero once again, because I was on the phone and texting him 
[00:06:30]  off and on through this whole little thing, and, you know, he helped me out.  Yeah.  Except for the one, the one thing he said where he goes, well, when their temperatures  get up to 104, 105, you got to, he might have a seizure in front of you.  What?  That's terrible.  And I said, what?  Who wants to see that?  And then he goes, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  He goes, it's really scary for the parents, but the kid will be fine in the end. 
[00:07:00]  Nothing will, there will be no, you know, everlasting problems with that.  Oh.  I'm like, what are you, a seizure?  Oh.  Well, I guess their little bodies, when they heat up that much, they can't take it, and  they fucking start spazzing out.  Wow.  So, see, a whole bunch of people are already calling, I feel your pain.  It's because the doctors don't know how to fucking, you know, fucking just talk to you  like a human being.  Yeah.  They have kids, too.  They know how this shit goes.  They get right to that fucking horrid point. 
[00:07:30]  And you call like a, what is it, like an answering service or whatever, because they're not at  the doctor's office.  And like, all right, what's the deal?  And I don't know, if you tell them that your kid who's less than three has 104 consistent  temperature, you would think someone will get back to you.  Yeah.  They never got back to me.  Jeez.  How about a house call?  They don't come with a little bag and come to your house?  Well, that would be great.  You can pay for that.  I had that done in Canada.  My girlfriend was sick a few years ago, and we had a doctor come. 
[00:08:00]  It was really weird.  In Canada?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because you can find houses.  The hotel hooked us up.  I don't think in America they do that at all.  Sure you can.  They really?  Not many.  It would cost you more, but I mean, you can get a house call.  You can't get a house call, because these guys need as many patients as possible.  I remember.  And that's another reason why they don't talk to you as an individual, because they've got  to move on to the next fucking case.  My pediatrician used to come over to the house.  Really?  Yeah.  Back in the olden days.  Little house on the prairie.  Dr. Fuchs.  Dr. Fuchs.  Dr. Fuchs would come over.  That's close to Fuchs. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  Did he spell it Fuchs?  Let's be honest.  It was a woman.  She was like a Nazi.  Was it F-U-C-H-S?  Yeah.  It was F-U-C-H-S.  That's Fuchs.  Dr. Fuchs.  When you have to think about it before you say it.  Well, Anthony, how about you?  I bet she was, and she probably was some Nazi doctor that fucking came over here and shit,  but she was, yeah, she'd come over with like the doctor bag with all the little goodies  in it.  Nice.  And fucking, you know, check you out.  Yeah.  Did she stick things in your hiney?  No, I never got the up the hiney thing for temperature or anything. 
[00:09:00]  Up, what is it?  Mine?  Up, mine hiney?  Oh, God.  Can we bring that back in honor of Steve's?  Oh, yeah.  Can we do one just in honor of Steve?  Mine hiney?  Yes.  Mine.  What is it?  Mine?  Mine hiney.  Yeah, you got to play one of those in a breakdown.  Yikes.  So he's still sick as fuck.  Yeah.  But whatever.  And then all of a sudden they're like, better.  Then all of a sudden they'll wake up and be like, yeah, he's better. 
[00:09:30]  Well, I'm hoping because he's got his little birthday party this weekend.  Oh, man.  Sick for a birthday?  That'd be terrible.  It's going to be close.  It's going to be really close.  Yeah.  Really fucking close.  So we'll see.  Because when I left the house, he wasn't much better.  But the little fucker now wants me to hold him.  Yeah.  The little fucker.  But he didn't want you to hold him for a while?  He's a fucking little man already.  He's a dude.  Yeah.  He wants mommy to hold him, but not daddy as much.  Yeah.  But now he wants me to hold him.  Yeah. 
[00:10:00]  I held him more Tuesday night than I have in a year.  Now he's all about fucking reaching his arms up.  Little bastard.  Were you kissing his head?  Oh, a million fucking times.  He was so fucking hot.  Yeah.  I was sweating.  Whatever.  Holding a little furnace.  It was a little furnace.  That's fucked up.  Dude, it was a little furnace.  It was fucking bad.  That's a good time to tell him about the Lord.  That's terrible. 
[00:10:30]  Now I'm hoping the little one doesn't get what he had.  That'll be even worse.  All you'd need.  Yeah.  So.  All right.  But anyway.  I decided to save something for Anthony for the air.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  We work for Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  What?  And.  Oh.  I.  This is going to cause some shit.  But.  A listener told me.  What the company is doing with us. 
[00:11:00]  A listener.  Yeah.  A listener.  On Twitter.  And I was like.  Ha ha.  That's funny.  Yeah.  There's no way a listener would know before me or Ann or Jim Norton.  Right.  Do you know that our channel is changing?  They're moving us?  I heard that.  I found out 10 minutes ago.  They're moving us.  I heard that too.  From a listener.  From a listener, right?  Yeah.  What.  The fuck?  Because my point was this.  Okay.  You know.  Having two kids and stuff. 
[00:11:30]  I'm not completely in touch as much as I used to be.  So I'm like.  All right.  Maybe.  Maybe they did tell me.  And I was fucking dazed and confused.  So I asked Ann.  And now I'm finding out from Jimmy.  You had no idea.  No.  Is it only here or is it in Canada?  I don't know.  Who the hell knows?  That's a good question.  Both.  Both?  Okay.  See.  All right.  These guys talk to us every fucking day about nonsense.  Nothing.  But they don't give us the big fucking news?  Changing the channel number is a huge thing for a show. 
[00:12:00]  First of all, I absolutely believe listeners go away because they just don't know where it is.  They tune in one day.  We're not there and assume we're just gone.  Because not everybody is a hardcore fan that knows if we're here or not here or something.  Right.  So they just think we're fucking gone and they don't fucking.  You absolutely lose the casual listener.  Right.  You know, we deal with the hardcores.  Those are the fucking pain in the ass fucking people that listen every single minute of every single fucking show.  And then we'll bitch and complain.  Right.  That the last minute wasn't as good as the first minute. 
[00:12:30]  But you came back strong on the third minute.  But the fourth minute was lacking something.  Holy fuck, you're exhausting.  But then there are other people that are kind of fans.  But they'll never, like, call the show.  They'll never tweet us.  They'll never go to a live event.  But they're also fans.  And then there's usually a third category.  And that's the category you're talking about, where it's casual listening.  If they come upon us, they're like, ah, this is pretty good.  I'm going to listen to these guys.  But they don't give a fuck.  They don't even know who's talking half the time.  The channel number is set there in the morning. 
[00:13:00]  Right.  Because they listen to the show.  But if we're not there, eh.  Right.  Eh.  And you're right.  So when you change channels or in regular radio, when you went across the street, it was a nightmare to try to build an audience.  Right.  Because their habits were set.  Yeah.  A sitcom changes its day.  They, you know, go, oh, we're changing from Thursday to Tuesday nights.  And, you know, they've got to promote the fuck out of it.  Right.  Because people just go away.  But you assume if this show is so powerful and hot that just moving it doesn't fucking matter. 
[00:13:30]  But it does, like you're saying.  It does fucking matter.  Even in TV, they have to sell the shit out of it to make sure you know where, I don't know, fucking, see, I don't like sitcom TV anymore.  So Big Bang Theory, let's say, if they move that shit, it would be a big fucking deal and a lot of promotion.  And perhaps if they told us, we would have been able to, you know, impart it to the listeners over the course of time, since they knew we were going to do this, that we would have said, like, hey, by the way, we're going to be on channel, blah, blah, blah.  Well, wouldn't you start promoting that?  Yes!  Of course. 
[00:14:00]  Wouldn't you, like, months ago go, warning, warning?  We could even be goofballs about it.  Right.  The Opie and Anthony are moving.  We don't know where yet, but stay tuned, and we'll let you know.  They never fucking told us that the channel was changing.  I still don't know what fucking channel we're going to.  I don't know why.  What's the upside of changing, and why do we have to change channels?  I don't know!  No one talks to us about something this important and this big, but they'll run into us after every show with nonsense. 
[00:14:30]  That stupid fucking minutia of the hashtag fucking thing.  That's what we hear about?  Their fuck-cunt hashtag?  Yo, they're taking that very seriously.  How about the channel number?  That's kind of important.  Well, so, I swear, they didn't tell me.  They didn't tell you, and Jimmy absolutely didn't know either.  No.  Okay, because I thought, I'm like, wow, man, I'm fucking out of it.  Isn't that great that listeners get to tell us that fucking...  On Twitter!  On Twitter.  So, I laughed, I'm like, ha, ha, ha. 
[00:15:00]  And then another tweet came in with the actual promotional material showing where we're going to be.  Where are we going to be, by the way?  So, everything's been printed out!  Why wouldn't they tell us that?  Why wouldn't they tell us?  I don't know, because we have shitty fucking people that oversee this channel.  I can't wait till after the show today, when they come up with this great excuse and reason why they didn't tell us,  that we'll have no responsibility put on them whatsoever.  It wasn't their fault or problem or error or anything that we weren't fucking told something as important as the channel number change. 
[00:15:30]  Um, well, you know, we had told this, and this was that, and we weren't sure.  And, uh, I don't know, we, uh...  It just...  It just...  It's beyond me how much of pieces of shit we are treated like.  What?  So, where are we going?  And why, and how, and who, and what?  I'm scared to tell you now. 
[00:16:00]  Where are we going?  Because it's, it's related to...  The wall.  What?  It's related to the wall.  Why, because of they?  They have our new channel.  Or our old channel, excuse me.  The fucking entertainment show?  Not only will they not knock this wall down and make our studio bigger, because they, they took on this entertainment weekly channel.  They took our channel?  Which is going to be a complete fucking bust, by the way, in the end. 
[00:16:30]  Uh, they would not remove the wall to give us a few extra feet.  We wanted the whole space.  Oh, shit.  And then what Scott Greenstein said, well, we could give you, we could give you about eight feet.  At that point, I'm like, great.  We'll take anything at this point.  And then they looked into it, and we learned that the wall will cost $500,000 to take down, which is a fucking solid, sweet fucking house for just about anyone listening.  I'm fuming.  They want to get some of our casual listeners to instantly give them some audience that they're just tuning in. 
[00:17:00]  That's absolutely what they're doing.  So, Entertainment Weekly, who has what we wanted, you know, more space, will be on, does it start today?  I don't even know.  It does not start today.  When does it start?  I don't even know.  I don't know what the official start date is.  Well, all the promotional material has been changed.  It's out there.  All the program guides have been changed.  Are they going to be on the same channel on both platforms?  Uh, yeah.  What?  Meaning?  They're going to be on XM 105, Sirius 105. 
[00:17:30]  Why couldn't we have been there then?  This is a show, they've told us for years, we couldn't be on the same channel number.  For years, they told us.  And now, there's a brand new thing, so it's not something that's been around for a while,  that they are actually putting on the same channel on both platforms.  They'll say it has something to do with the older units and the pay system.  Oh, and the satellites and this and fuck.  That's what the answer is.  It's, well, you're a premium channel.  But they're just fucking, they're just making it harder and harder to keep an audience. 
[00:18:00]  I swear to you, I was telling you before the show, I finally have XM back in the house.  Finally.  Because I didn't want to deal with it anymore because our VIP, we're lucky enough to have  VIP accounts because we work here, but they shut off our VIP accounts because they don't  know if we're working here anymore, I guess.  So then every, like.  Then they can't find the channel.  Every, what is it?  I don't even know, every six months, a year, I have no idea.  All of a sudden, the unit stops working and you got to go through this whole fucking thing  to get it turned back on. 
[00:18:30]  So my thought was, fuck it.  Even though I work here, fuck it.  Fuck it.  Because I'm from the school of thought, if it's not easy, I don't fucking want to deal  with it.  Period.  That's how people, you know, think in this world.  If you don't make it really easy for me, then you don't want to deal, right?  So anyway, long story short, though, after about three years, I finally got XM back in  my house.  I'm like, you know what?  I work for the company.  I might as well get XM in the house. 
[00:19:00]  But I don't, I have an XM in the house and a Sirius unit in the car and it confuses the  fuck out of me.  Not just because of our channel.  Oh, that's right.  We're on 206 on Sirius.  Oh, that's right.  We're on 105 on XM.  It's music channels and everything else also changes.  Do you fucking believe they're giving them 105 on both channels?  I mean, of course I believe it.  Of course.  So where are we going?  To 103.  103 and what's the other one we're on now?  Why couldn't they just give them 103 on both? 
[00:19:30]  Right.  So we're 103 and what?  I don't know.  I think still 206.  But why, if they're making these changes, why can't they just do 103 for both of us,  for us on both units?  We were told that you're still separate channels.  Why?  We're supposedly a high profile show for this place.  Holy mother of fuck.  But a brand new fucking channel starts up and they do it right. 
[00:20:00]  There'll be 105 on both.  This channel that you're listening to.  Yep.  Why are they doing this?  And why weren't we in on the conversation?  Not even in on the conversation.  I found out through a listener.  We have our shit fuck meetings every once in a blue moon down the hall.  Thank God it's only once in a blue moon.  And the important things just fucking fly past us.  I'm not meeting with anybody anymore. 
[00:20:30]  Why?  It's useless.  It's fucking useless.  If they're not telling us shit like this in these meetings, then there's no need to go  and fucking waste my fucking time sitting there listening to horse shit.  And I know the Radio Wizard gets really, really bummed that we beat the shit out of him.  But then, look.  Look what happens.  Take it to fucking upstairs.  Kick it upstairs.  I'm not listening to anyone.  I'm not listening to Bladder.  I'm not listening to the fucking Radio Wizard or the other guy.  I'm not listening to anyone anymore. 
[00:21:00]  Anyone.  Is Bob involved at all?  Here, here, here.  Here's my official statement.  Don't approach me with anything anymore.  I'm coming in at 6.  I'm leaving at 10.  I'm doing the show.  And don't approach me with meetings or fucking ideas or anything.  I know what's best for me in doing this show from 6 to 10.  I know how to fucking do a radio show.  Wait, us.  So.  Us.  I'm talking personally.  Us, though.  Yeah, but no, no. 
[00:21:30]  I mean, if it's your.  I'm just fucking with you.  But, like, as far as me personally goes, that's what I do.  Anything else, talk to other people about it.  Because that's apparently what you do with the important things.  I don't want to hear from them.  At all.  I just huff and puff and sigh every day after I leave here.  I'm done.  Because I'm like, what now?  I know how many times I've said, what now?  Yeah.  And it's always some nonsense thing.  So they fucked us. 
[00:22:00]  103 is the Spice channel.  What's the Spice channel?  It's like porno radio.  It's like Playboy radio, but dirtier.  Oh, fuck.  So why won't they take their channel and give them 103 across both?  Yeah.  Spice channel?  And, of course, that bald dope down the hall won't even come on the air and discuss this.  That could be one of ten people.  Off the air.  Off the air, we'll talk.  No, we're not talking off air anymore.  I'm so done.  Explain to me fucking why this went down without us knowing. 
[00:22:30]  What?  You gotta make it hurt.  Fuck it.  What's serious 103?  What's serious 103?  Because why couldn't they just give the entertainment thing 103, 103, and leave us where the fuck we were?  Radio sex.  Radio sex?  Oh, look out!  You can't go on the internet and see fucking a horse fucking a woman in the asshole. 
[00:23:00]  Wait.  Let's get the radio sex.  Ooh.  We've been involved with...  Racy.  We've been involved with Sirius for four years.  I never knew there was a channel called Radio Sex.  I didn't either.  What kind of losers are jacking to that?  No one.  No one.  What the fuck's on radio sex?  It took over when the deal with Playboy radio went away.  But who listens to that shit?  And, by the way, they're allowed to do way more than we're allowed to do.  So they didn't change that person's channel, this station, and give them at Entertainment Weekly 103, 103, if they want the same numbers. 
[00:23:30]  No, they're 105, 105.  Why wouldn't they give them 103, 103, and leave us the fuck alone?  I don't know.  And why weren't we even allowed to discuss this?  I don't know.  Do you want me to tell you what they're going to say?  Sure.  They would tell you that they're moving the channels around so that down more towards the 100s, where you are, 103 area, that's going to be more male-skewed.  And then as you go higher...  Two channels higher! 
[00:24:00]  It's 105!  They overthink the stupidest shit instead of just doing basic, logical things.  Like, before you start thinking of that shit, how about you get your shows on the same channel on both fucking companies?  That would be my number one thing I would do for this company if I was the CEO.  But they don't...  Especially the high-profile shows.  Opie and Anthony.  I know there's a new guy upstairs.  I haven't met him yet.  I hear he's really nice, because...  Eh, whatever.  That's a long story.  But my kid plays with a kid that's father works here. 
[00:24:30]  That he's...  Eh, whatever.  I hear he's a nice guy.  But his first thing he should be doing is getting us on the exact same channel on both fucking units.  Yes!  And other shows.  Not just our show.  There's probably other shows.  And keeping us there!  Not moving us around like fucking...  Like vagabonds!  Oh my god.  Are they just trying to push us out slowly?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What?  Because part of me thinks they're just trying to...  They're still embarrassed of the show, or they're slowly trying to push us out. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  Because now what's coming in on the phones is I don't even get Channel 103.  Well, maybe they don't get it yet, but they will.  Why?  What's on 103 right now?  Radio Sex.  No, we're not 103 on Sirius.  Or is that XM?  See, I don't know!  Where are we?  I don't know!  What is 103?  Radio Sex is 103 on what?  Uh, Sirius?  It says it's a premium program, though.  Radio Sex. 
[00:25:30]  So wait, a premium program, probably...  Here's what they'll say.  Well, because it's a Sirius premium program, it's able to go across the same number channel  on both platforms.  But because you're an XM program, it's got to do with the satellites and the older units.  Why?  It's just utter shit.  It's bullshit.  Why after all these years are they keeping this so complicated?  They're lying to us.  Not just for us, from a company standpoint.  People don't want to think about shit.  They don't want to have to think, where the fuck is my favorite fucking show?  You've got to make it as easy as possible for people. 
[00:26:00]  How many times does Shade have to change their channel number?  They've always been 45.  Oh, how about Howard's channel?  How many times has that changed?  Zero!  Really?  Zero!  Wow.  What about Jay Thomas?  What channels he's on?  What channels is he on?  He's on Indy.  Yeah?  How many times has that changed?  It doesn't change often.  Wait, how many times have we changed?  We've changed...  Holy fuck!  This is our third...  Third change!  The third fucking channel.  You piece of a cunt! 
[00:26:30]  What?  What?  And Radio Sex is 103 on both platforms.  What is going on?  103 on both platforms.  Are they still embarrassed of the show?  We've proved ourselves years ago.  It's a premium channel, but it's 103 on both platforms.  Well, again, they'll say it's a premium channel.  Here's what they'll say.  It's a serious premium channel.  Now, serious premium channels like Howard's can go across both platforms, but an XM-based  premium channel cannot go across...  So put us on serious!  It's the same company!  It's the same company! 
[00:27:00]  So make us serious!  There!  And that was the point Louie made recently, and we've also made...  Like, who gives a fuck about the premium channels at this point?  Take the fucking hit, because from a company standpoint, you're confusing the fuck out of  your customers.  Oh my God.  So take the hit, as much money as it brings in that extra, what, $2 or whatever the fuck  you have to do to get us on serious.  Just get rid of all that shit and make it as easy as possible.  Oh my God.  Make up the money some other way.  If it's the same company, and because we're on XM, we can't go on another channel because 
[00:27:30]  the premiums from XM don't translate to serious, then magically make us a serious show, and  have us premium there, and then...  You're allowed to do that now, that the merger happened years ago.  It's the same fucking company.  So just, it's semantics at this point.  Make us serious.  How about giving us 103 on both platforms then?  Right.  I would take the move...  At least that's something, right.  If they gave us 103 on both platforms, I would take that move. 
[00:28:00]  What's 103 on serious?  Sex.  That's the radio sex.  I thought we thought that was XM.  It's both.  It's across both platforms.  But they can't do that for us, though.  No, because we're XM.  You own the company.  You could figure that out.  Of course they could.  It's not like you have to call the guys from serious and go, hey, we want to make a little  side deal.  No, you own XM and serious, so you could do whatever.  You could work this out.  Then again, if they were going to do that for us, I'm naive.  If they were going to give us 103 on both, they would just have given us 105 on both. 
[00:28:30]  So they're not going to do that.  Right.  No, of course they're not going to do that.  We're 206 for whatever reason.  We're the show that you could just change the channels around on.  We need to get the Entertainment Weekly on the same channel on both.  What are we going with?  Oh, 105?  Oh, who's there?  Opium Ethic.  Oh, yeah, fuck them.  Let's just change their channel again.  Why do they treat a brand new show that hasn't even proven themselves, they haven't even  broadcast it yet, way better than us? 
[00:29:00]  We thought you knew this was happening.  No idea.  Of course you thought we knew.  Why would you assume that management wouldn't have told us that our channel has changed that?  It's not your responsibility.  Of course it's not.  It's not Travis's.  It's not E-Rock's.  It's not Sam's.  Sal's just whatever.  Holy shit.  Yeah, I mean, nothing's his responsibility.  I don't ever expect Sal to tell me something that I don't know already.  He's not allowed to.  There's something that we tell him he doesn't know yet.  Yeah.  Get it, Sal.  I'm sorry.  But why? 
[00:29:30]  I mean, Entertainment Weekly, they figured it out for them.  They got them on both fucking channels.  Yeah.  They're not premium.  Enough with this premium shit.  Show me the numbers.  How much money are you bringing in because we're a premium channel on Sirius?  God, did they just kick us and fucking treat us like shit.  Yeah.  But again, because there's no agent involved either.  That's looking out for shit.  He's fucking...  I like the guy a lot.  I love him.  But he's an absentee guy.  He's in LA and he's worried about...  An absentee landlord!  He is. 
[00:30:00]  He is.  Oh my God.  Now, now, now...  I don't, I don't even want to fucking hear it.  I don't want to hear the lies that will come out of their fucking mouths trying to explain  this shit.  Is it lies?  It's just going to be blatant lying will come out of their mouths as to why they're  doing this and they'll have some convoluted, vague explanation as to why this had to be 
[00:30:30]  done like this and try to, try to word it in a way that makes it seem like, oh, you poor  little retards can't understand.  But believe me, it's, it's, this is how it had to be.  I don't want to hear it.  XM's so lost in that merger.  Oh my God.  Did we lose in that merger?  If I see the retarded Lex Luthor walk down that fucking hall, I swear to God, I'm not  saying a fucking word to him.  How about the Montreal trip?  How's that coming for the festival?  That's going well, right? 
[00:31:00]  There, there's some meetings.  We should know something.  Maybe Friday, maybe Monday.  What's today?  We started May.  Okay, so two months beforehand.  That's enough time to prepare.  Fair enough.  And the bus tour.  I'm sure you guys are having discussions about that, right?  Enough.  Enough.  Let's just stop already.  Let's stop already.  Late fall?  It's on the calendar for late fall?  End of September.  Nice.  Yeah, yeah.  Six months after it was supposed to happen.  And, and, and, and Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny.  Right, sure, sure.  And the Tooth Fairy, yeah, and the bus trip. 
[00:31:30]  Sure.  And then, I mean, if you really want to get into this, there's people calling, bitching  like crazy.  This guy, James in Texas.  When I bought my radio, I had to put a new radio in and new electronics to get you guys.  Oh, great.  They got a fucking, they got a  jury rigged.  Why do some of these units don't have certain channels?  I don't get it.  My dad pays for, you know, Sirius XM in his car.  Right.  And he was adding online.  Mm-hmm.  And like, you would think that that would just be like two clicks, right? 
[00:32:00]  Oh, it should be the easiest thing.  Like on a website.  Now I have online $3, whatever.  He said it was the phone calls that he had to make.  Just to get an online account.  The customer service is an abomination.  Well, it was.  It's an abomination.  Because it was employee service.  It was voted one of the worst customer services in the country, right?  Yeah.  Made a big fucking article recently that we talked about.  But at least it's good news for EW.  Yeah.  Good for them.  I'm glad.  I got screamed at last week for my rant. 
[00:32:30]  Screamed at.  And because people took it personally when they shouldn't have because it wasn't directed  at them individually.  Yeah, but they don't even understand that in the end it just makes good radio.  Yeah, people liked it.  That people were losing their shit over something.  Oh, I would do tell.  Just yelled at because it was.  The hashtag.  Yeah.  Because you know how Jimmy went off on the hashtag and it made for really good radio.  Yeah.  He got yelled at.  It was.  Because they took it personally.  Wait, wait.  By them?  Yes.  You entertained.  You didn't just laugh and walk away?  What?  It wasn't even the hashtag. 
[00:33:00]  It was the idea that.  No, it bothered me.  It wasn't the hashtag.  It was the fact.  It was the whole Cheadle thing that he was.  In the mind of Disney.  The Opie and Anthony show and Rotten Tomatoes Radio are on par.  Because we took Ben Kingsley so we couldn't get Don Cheadle.  Disney was giving us one of two.  Because they're splitting them up across the platform.  So I said.  The rage of that whole thing came.  If people on the outside see this show on par with Rotten Tomatoes Radio. 
[00:33:30]  That is the fault of the company.  We can't change that on the air.  Because we don't get casual listeners anymore.  Like you know I used to get accidental people falling on you.  Sure.  We don't get that.  We are.  I hate to say preaching to the converted.  But that's what we're doing.  We're talking to listeners who are already here.  So the only way to change that perception is in the company's hands to change it.  They refuse to do it.  They never will do it.  So the fact that that happened.  The fact that Disney said to Roland and to this show. 
[00:34:00]  You can't get Cheadle because you have Ben Kingsley already booked.  And we're only giving you one of the two because they're promoting the same movie.  The fact that we're looked at as the same as Rotten Tomatoes Radio.  Is all you need to know about the way this company promotes the show.  And it's never going to change.  So that was my whole point.  But they got mad at me.  Blatter got mad at me.  And it's like I like him personally.  He knows that.  It's like he just took it like I was fucking shitting on him.  But it's like I really wasn't.  Who cares? 
[00:34:30]  I'm just saying that was you know.  Oh I know but who cares?  That's where it all you know.  Hashtags.  But look at this.  The hashtag is working out well man.  I'm going through my Twitter right now.  Yeah.  That hashtag is oh that's right.  No one's using it.  And it's not even something we we didn't ask for the hashtag right.  Well it's also.  No but we don't need it.  But but it tells you a lot about what goes on around here.  A hashtag for the show and you put it on the pad. 
[00:35:00]  All right.  That's cool.  Yeah.  But it's called it just a throwaway.  Right.  But to them they had meetings and and they had like stuff printed out for me to look  at like well what do you think it's going to look like this but we can make it look like  this but we're not even sure we want to say Opie and Anthony.  We're thinking maybe ONA or maybe Opie with that amber sand or whatever the fuck you call  it and Anthony.  They had all different versions and I'm like who cares?  In the end it doesn't matter.  It's just a throwaway.  But I did say it has to be Opie and Anthony because a bunch of these idiots thought ONA  was good enough and I said no ONA is what the hardcores know us as but if you're trying 
[00:35:30]  to if you're trying to brand it and get more people to fucking actually listen to the show  you have to go with the full names which is Opie and Anthony.  Hey that's what I said to him.  Well that's good because they were arguing about the fact.  I like so much discussion about a dumb hashtag.  I'm stunned here at this point.  And in the end it's nice and it helps us a little bit but it really is one of those  throwaway things.  I mean you know real issues is getting us a bigger fucking studio getting us on the 
[00:36:00]  same channel on both Sirius and XM.  Those are real issues that you could probably you know help us out with which would really  really help in the end.  It's never going to happen and I think we have to accept that as a show for real like I'm not  being radio it's never going to happen.  They're never going to do it.  Proof is this.  It just looked like they were they gave Entertainment Weekly the priority over this show.  They're giving them what we want both across both boards.  But they'll say no because they're not a premium channel for Sirius so that's why it was easy 
[00:36:30]  to just do that for them.  Yeah.  But you own both companies so if it's easy to just put us on the exact same channel in  both fucking units.  Yeah.  You own the company you don't have to fucking answer to anybody.  You're the guy.  Yep.  Un-fucking-believable.  You're the guy.  Un-fucking-believable.  Because there was a time I think through the merger that they couldn't really fuck with  too much of the programming at first.  It was some weird fucking I don't know thing that was part of the merger at first I think. 
[00:37:00]  But not anymore.  They own both fucking companies.  It's years later.  Yeah.  This is a just fucking treat us like shit fucking moment right here with this channel  thing.  Treat us like shit.  It's that we got the wrong guys overseeing the channel to begin with.  Absolutely.  And we have an agent that's been asleep at the wheel for a long fucking time.  And I don't even want to fucking see them. 
[00:37:30]  I don't even want to see them anymore.  I don't even want to see them anymore.  It's useless.  I don't really don't understand it.  I mean at times they show that we're like a very important show for the company and then  they don't even do the basic shit right.  They just fucking change the channel number?  They have zero interest in furthering the show.  That's all it is.  Change the fucking channel number?  Imagine you're a fucking sitcom on a network and fucking all of a sudden you come in and 
[00:38:00]  like you don't even know that they were changing your day to fucking Thursday to Tuesday or  like you'd be like what?  It shows a complete lack of any respect for anybody in this room.  I don't even think it's a respect thing.  I think I think you got guys that are so inexperienced.  They don't even understand what this means in the basics of management.  Like like that's a basic.  Yes.  You tell the guys what's going on.  I swear to you I think it's more to do with inexperience. 
[00:38:30]  Well then don't come and fucking rag on us like you do have experience and knowledge  about anything.  The second I get a fucking sideways look from one of those cocksuckers I've had it.  That's it.  I don't even want to talk to them.  I'm done.  And if they get mad at me for not going to meetings then take it upstairs.  Take it to a higher source and I'll explain to them why I'm not going to a meeting.  I'm sure they'd love to hear why I'm not going in the same room and hanging out in a little 
[00:39:00]  chat with you guys.  If you want to fuck yourself like that then let me talk to someone upstairs because that  would be it wouldn't it wouldn't bode well for you.  It wouldn't look good for your side as to why I don't want to meet with you because they'd  go what really that's what they're doing.  Yeah.  Hey can you believe it.  Yeah.  They have every they have every right to move us to where are we going one on six one  three and two.  I know it's the whole double it. 
[00:39:30]  What channel you on one oh three.  Where are you on the serious double it.  I love the whole thing.  Just double it.  That's a great line.  But I swear to you that's probably their logic.  Right.  In the end that just might be their logic.  Well look.  Oh one oh three times two.  That's two or six.  OK.  That's great.  You got to do math to listen.  That's what I like when you need mathematics involved in your fucking listening to a show.  A lot of people saying they don't get one oh three yet.  Are they going to get one oh three.  I'm sure they will.  But I don't know because no one has talked to us about this. 
[00:40:00]  And to be fair for all the casual listeners you're losing you'll be picking up all the  casual radio sex.  Yeah.  Great.  So we get the perverts.  You want me to run down and ask real quick what's going on.  I could just go.  There's going to be here's what's going to happen.  There's even here.  Here's what's going to happen.  They're going to launch with their big morning show over there at Entertainment Weekly.  And there's going to be people that just have us on like they do every morning.  And then there'll be a morning show and they'll just be listening like what's this. 
[00:40:30]  What's that.  And they won't change the state.  No.  It's not that important to them.  Nope.  So they get a built in initial audience.  They don't have to start from zero.  No.  They get that built in initial Opie and Anthony fucking audience.  Right.  And we get we get sex radio.  They'll get a lot of our people just sampling the new show.  Right.  The casual listeners especially that don't care enough to go.  Whoa.  Wait.  They're gone.  I bet that was calculated.  So they get an initial fucking little boost. 
[00:41:00]  If you and believe me if you think this is just for the air I don't want to talk to them.  Don't fucking bother coming down the hall at the end of this program to have a little meeting.  I'm fucking I've had it with talking to them.  You want me to talk to somebody I'll fucking talk to Scott or anyone above Scott.  I'm done dealing with the minion with the incompetent minion that supposedly runs this fucking channel. 
[00:41:30]  Had it.  We got good news coming in from John.  Oh yeah.  John in Mississippi.  John.  Yeah.  Go ahead buddy.  Hey man.  I just want to tell you there's some other channels that have changed.  They've been showing it all week long.  What channel they're changing to and the date.  Wait.  Wait.  We don't even have promos running on this channel saying we're going to move to the channel.  To 103.  Uh uh.  Do we have.  We don't even have promos Iraq.  No.  We have them ready.  What? 
[00:42:00]  Like three different other channels.  We have them ready.  Well why haven't they been playing since the second we they knew we were changing.  We have them ready.  Yeah.  We have them ready to go.  So when are they going to decide to start playing these things?  If other channels are already playing.  Fuck it.  Why?  What happened?  I'm starting to hear.  It's May 8th by the way guys.  So you'll know.  I swear to you I didn't know that.  So now another listener is telling us when the change happens.  May 8th?  May 8th.  Oh that's a lot sooner than you guys are saying. 
[00:42:30]  So when you start running the promos immediately.  We've had them ready for two weeks.  So why are they waiting?  What are they waiting for?  We've had them ready for two weeks.  Promos.  How come we didn't know about it?  That Travis is getting a text saying something different.  What?  I'm being told that they discussed this with you.  When?  I don't know.  All I was told was.  I have no recollection of them telling us this.  So you're saying the three of us.  Me, Jimmy and Opie. 
[00:43:00]  Have no recollection of us being told that we're changing channels.  That's correct.  But they told us we are.  I don't swear to my kids because I think that's crazy shit.  We stood in the studio and discussed this move with all three of them.  When?  I don't know.  And they're telling us they told us Entertainment Weekly is taking your channel?  No, no, no, no you didn't.  Well I don't know about that part.  Maybe just the channel changes.  Because I would have had these concerns about audience.  And why, why, um, yeah I would have too.  Why, um, uh, why 103?  Oh I have no idea.  Could you ask this idiot that won't come on the fucking air with us? 
[00:43:30]  I think, I think, uh, the idea is that they're moving a few channels around.  They're introducing Entertainment Weekly and Comedy Central Radio.  And so they want to push you guys down a couple channels to keep you in that, uh, sort of male skewed.  We're in the, we're already on 105.  No, 105 starts to get towards the females.  Two channels up?  No.  So 103?  It's in the entertainment category, which is weird too.  Because shouldn't we be in the comedy category?  When we're not bitching, when we are a funny show. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  Why are we still in the entertainment category?  Technically we're neither.  Yeah, I think initially, I mean, I think you used to be in the comedy category and then  they moved to entertainment.  Of course they did.  It's talk and entertainment.  Yeah.  I asked why 103, by the way.  I'll see if I get an answer.  How about, he comes on the air.  Is he here?  No, he's not here yet.  Why would you be here at 7 o'clock if your whole job is to oversee the Opie and Anthony  show?  Why would you?  Not that we want to see you more, but logically, wouldn't that make sense? 
[00:44:30]  If you're overseeing Opie and Anthony, then you get here when the guys get here.  Not every once in a while and then poke your head in like, hey, I'm here.  Hey, what's up?  Oh, good for you.  You decide to come in early for once every three months.  Pop-tarts.  If I was told.  Yeah, and then they throw pop-tarts at us because they think we like pop-tarts because  me and Ann have a pop-tart every, how many times do we have a pop-tart in a quarter?  Once in a blue moon.  But to them, they think we have pop-tarts every morning, so when they come in early every  once in a while, they'll throw pop-tarts at me.  Here's the children.  Rob stopped bringing pop-tarts. 
[00:45:00]  Well, good.  He should have.  Gary says Sam is generally right about 103.  That's what I thought, yeah.  That they're trying to just, not like, they're grouping the.  The only move we want to hear is that we finally figure out you're on the same channel.  I'm on Sirius and XM, making it much easier for the listener to keep up with you guys.  So to everyone else, they're magically able to fucking do this and put them on the same  channel.  Because, I mean, I bet you if you took a survey, a lot of these people do have one, you know, 
[00:45:30]  at least one of each.  Yeah, especially with, like, different car companies having different deals with Sirius  and XM.  I'm like, like you said, you know, you could have XM in your house and Sirius in your car  because that's what you have to have in your car.  Hey, during this magical meeting we had about this, about this channel change, where we all  seem to have amnesia about it, what did I say when you told me?  Did I, what did I say about, about why?  Did I ask, why did I just go, did you say, hey, we're changing your channel? 
[00:46:00]  And I went, okay, and that was it?  Or did I ask, why?  And when I asked, why, what was your answer?  Did you say, because Entertainment Weekly is taking it?  And then I went, okay, what happened?  Don't just tell me you told us.  Give me an indication as to how I was there, what I said, what Opie said, what Jimmy said.  And we didn't just accept it, so tell us what happened and how you appeased us by explaining 
[00:46:30]  why we were doing this.  Because you know why?  Because we weren't told.  Bullshit.  A lot of people are saying they don't get 103, so could you write that idiot about that?  And also write him about when were we going to start promoting the fact that we're moving?  Because a lot of people are saying that on the pad data and everything, everywhere else,  they're basically promoting the fact that that certain channel's moving. 
[00:47:00]  Does that make sense?  I'll ask when promotion was to start.  Okay, the other channels that are moving are advertising that they're moving.  Yeah, on the pad data and, you know, audio-wise, they're running promos.  Oh, what's he saying?  I don't know.  Are we getting the same channel on both platforms?  No.  No.  It's XM 103 and Sirius.  We were told that.  We were told that, Jimmy.  Where were you?  Remember?  They did tell us, not only are you not getting the studio, but Entertainment Weekly is taking  the space you wanted, and they're going to get the channel you're on now.  And we don't remember that?  No, I don't remember.  Like, we would have just went, yeah, cool, and forgot about it? 
[00:47:30]  I don't think the Entertainment Weekly aspect was ever met, because this is the first we're  hearing about it.  Well, they knew they must have known where the channel was going.  I'm going to, in their defense, say something.  Uh-oh.  And I truly mean this.  They could have very easily told us all this, to be fair.  But they say so much bullshit and throw so much dumb shit at us that never happens, 
[00:48:00]  that a lot of times we do just go, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because we know in the end it's not going to happen, like the bus trip.  That's late September.  I told you about that with my wife.  She's like, when are you going away for a week?  You know?  She's cool and all, but she's like...  Did you just start laughing?  Well, she's got to make plans, you know, because we've got two kids who don't have a lot of  family around, so you've got to, like, really figure out, you know, to get some extra help  if I'm on the road for a week.  And I go, oh, God, that thing?  I go, that ain't happening.  That's exactly what I told her.  I go, that ain't happening. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah?  Promotion begins today.  Of course it does, because we're bitching.  Oh, stop it!  Of course.  Of course it starts today, because we're bitching.  Why didn't it start earlier?  Don't just write promotion comes today, starts today.  Because all the channels have...  Why didn't it start earlier?  I'm not sure why or if other channels went early.  Why didn't it start weeks ago?  Why?  If all the production was done, that should went on the air immediately. 
[00:49:00]  They don't want to confuse the listeners, I'm sure, because the listener hears a promo,  they only hear half of it.  The listeners are already fucking dizzy and confused.  The show is confused!  You don't want to tell them things too far ahead of, you know, go for it.  Holy shit.  Yeah, so you give them six days, advanced notice.  Six hours.  No, that's a...  I mean, that's a big deal, and that's something you've got to really hammer for a long time.  Especially if the channel doesn't exist on some of the radios right now.  Right.  Oh, my God.  He's also saying that the same conversation was about the worst of on the indie channel. 
[00:49:30]  So, maybe if that's ringing a bell, this was discussed at the same time.  Oh, but...  Oh, oh, okay.  So, the indie channel.  Did that start yet?  Yes.  I have no idea.  Oh.  Not because...  Because I don't care enough.  Yes, it's been on for about three to four weeks.  Okay.  And my point...  Does anyone remember my point about the time slot?  I said it was a shitty time slot.  Yes, I remember you saying that.  And with football right around the corner, it's going to be an even shittier time slot? 
[00:50:00]  What is it, first of all?  They give us an hour on Indy a week or something?  Two hours?  I don't even know.  Three?  Two hours.  It's Sundays, 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Eastern.  And it's been running for three to four weeks.  Back to my point, which I said, the day they told me the time slot, I go, it's a shitty time...  No, it's a really good time slot.  No, it's not.  It's a shitty time slot.  I know our listeners, no one's up that early.  Trust me, I'm up early because I've got kids, and I can't talk to anyone on Twitter because  no one's up yet.  I see Ant's last tweet, and then I fucking tag, and then I'm up at six in the morning 
[00:50:30]  until noon.  People start fucking tweeting me around noon.  Okay?  The point being, it's a shitty time slot, and with football around the corner, it's going  to be an even shittier time slot.  It's been on the air three to four weeks?  Yes, it's been four weeks.  I swear to you, and I want to ask everyone else in the room, I have gotten zero tweets  about the fact that we're on the Indy channel.  Zero.  And if I fucking pick my nose, I get a thousand tweets, okay? 
[00:51:00]  They're in our lives and in our business all the fucking time, our fans.  They're passionate, and they're hardcore.  Not one fucking tweet that we're even on there going, hey, this is kind of cool that I get  to hear you on Sirius on the Indy channel.  And the reason is because it's a throwaway.  No one's fucking listening during that time.  Anyone tweet you about being on the Indy channel?  Not a peep.  Not a peep.  By the way, the promos are running today. 
[00:51:30]  They're starting today.  E-Rock says the promos for the channel changes are not in the log, which means they weren't  scheduled for today.  Of course not.  They're trying to cover their ass.  When were they going to?  They weren't going to start today.  Stop it.  Another lie.  When were they going to start?  I don't know, but I have a feeling they'll be inserted ASAP.  Exactly.  But they said they'd start today, but now E-Rock's catching them in another lie because  it would be in the log already.  It would be in the log.  But they'll go, I don't know why they didn't put it in the log.  Oh, God.  Because none of these guys will take responsibility for any of this shit. 
[00:52:00]  Incompetence.  Fuck.  E-Rock is the truth, police.  Yeah.  If you go to 103 today, it says May 9th, it's going to change.  To what?  Does it mention to what?  I don't know.  There's just people fucking calling it.  Everybody should have 103 by the time the channel changes.  I don't think that's going to...  Well, that's great that people don't even have the channel we're going to now. 
[00:52:30]  We're starting all over again.  This is great.  Yeah, it knocks down our audience.  It absolutely does.  Fucking lootly does.  And don't tell me it doesn't because you don't know...  You might know 10% what I know about radio, so shut the fuck up.  I just humor you and look you in the eye like, oh, okay.  You don't know shit.  Because I paid attention since I was 18 years old as far as this business goes.  It's definitely going to knock our audience down.  That we lose a chunk of our audience and we have to rebuild.  Yes.  I guarantee that. 
[00:53:00]  And don't tell me differently because you don't know crap or you'd be on the fucking radio making a shitload of money instead of making nothing and fucking overseeing this shit.  God.  Fuck you.  Just fucking crap.  Disgusted.  I have to piss. 
[00:53:30]  Oh my God.  It's all good.  It's all good.  It's all good.  Yeah.  It's all good.  Sure.  Give me another salary.  I'll oversee this fucking thing.  No problem.  But the salary is going to be another big fucking nut.  And I'll oversee this fucking channel.  I have no problem doing that if you pay me.  Because these guys are useless.  Will you also oversee radio sex?  I didn't even bring to the show that I did a photo shoot for my college newspaper or magazine. 
[00:54:00]  Gary actually showed me four pictures they're considering using.  And they were photoshopping a little bit.  A little touch up.  He showed me two pictures.  Your neck is long.  I swear to you.  Oh no.  It looked like I had a facelift.  And he actually presented these as possible pictures that they would put on a front cover of a college newspaper.  I'm like, are you? 
[00:54:30]  What's wrong?  I go, what's wrong with you?  No.  Yeah.  It looked like a facelift.  Because they just erased all lines.  Right, right.  Looks like those promo shots from toddlers and tiaras.  And then I called him out on it.  He's like, he actually said, and he'll probably say differently.  Well, I don't think they look that bad.  I go, it doesn't look like me.  It looks like me with a facelift.  Yeah.  Why would I want to put that out in the world?  Oh my God. 
[00:55:00]  But they can't do anything right.  Nothing.  Everything just gets screwed up.  We went from having Eric Logan overseeing us to idiots that have never done this type of radio.  They're good music guys.  All of them are good music guys.  I don't know why that means they would be good at overseeing an edgy talk show.  So, yeah.  Fucking pick out the next college radio hit. 
[00:55:30]  Great.  Good for you.  See this guy.  You guys are on the Indy channel?  Yes.  But no one knows that.  Did we even run a promo on this channel saying we're on the Indy channel?  No.  I don't think so.  No.  Why would you?  Oh, it'll run today.  Quick.  Quick.  Get something.  I'm a casual listener since NAW.  If they change it, it's going to be hard to find and I'll cancel my subscription. 
[00:56:00]  We know all that.  I know all that.  Because some people don't know.  They'll just tune in.  We won't be there.  They'll assume we got fired or quit.  Or they don't care enough.  Or they don't care enough.  Right.  Right.  If you don't make it easy, they don't care enough to go search us out.  Yes.  The hardcore, certainly.  They'll always be with us.  We know that.  And we know most of them by name at this point.  I feel like CNN used to be channel 10 on Time Warner and then they moved it. 
[00:56:30]  I don't know.  That is a great point.  I don't know where it is.  There's a bunch of channels that have moved on my Time Warner that I don't care enough to find anymore.  You're absolutely right.  I go to Fox News because I know where that is.  You're absolutely right.  When the promos start running.  Today.  Because it was always scheduled to run today.  Won't the people with Sirius radios be confused?  Because the channel's not changing?  You know what I mean?  Because the Sirius channel stays the same. 
[00:57:00]  But the XM channel changes.  Yeah, well.  But the Sirius listeners will hear the promo.  Good luck figuring that one out.  And they'll be like, what?  What happened to my radio sex?  Radio sex.  Radio sex.  Ooh, what do they talk about?  Look out.  Sex bagels.  Oh, God.  Nagel the bagel.  Radio sex.  What do they do on that?  And are they Playboy?  No.  No, that's different.  There's one channel.  Playboy radio is one channel. 
[00:57:30]  And then Radio sex is another channel.  Whoa.  Why not make them both Playboy channel?  No.  Two sex channels.  Why?  And what's their big benchmark show at Radio sex?  Yeah, yeah.  It's YouPorn.  The two biggest names in the history of adult cinema.  Ginger, Lynn, and Christy Canyon take you on a daily ride through a circus of sex.  Great.  Fucking two old ladies.  Ew.  Two fucking old ladies now.  Two old bags.  Two old bats. 
[00:58:00]  Are fucking going to try to be all sexy.  Are going to try to give you a turgid cock.  Man, are they clueless.  Yuck.  What do you mean?  That is the worst description for a show ever.  That's the morning show slash afternoon show.  Just picture the fucking sex in the city Samantha conversations.  That's probably what the whole thing is.  Guess what I did last night.  I sucked off the bellhop at a hotel.  You get to listen to Naughty Gamers. 
[00:58:30]  What is Naughty Gamers?  Well, with porn stars Alana Evans and Missy Martinez, they explore the sexy side of adult video  gaming.  Wow.  What niche are they trying to latch onto there?  Adult video gaming?  Yes.  What the fuck is that?  Name one.  Lounge Lizard Larry?  Name one adult video game.  Leisure Suit Larry.  Leisure Suit Larry?  That was it.  Leisure Suit Larry. 
[00:59:00]  All right.  What's the next program that comes on?  Date with Destiny.  Okay.  That sounds good.  Her name, Destiny?  Yo-ya.  All right.  Here's the description.  Have you ever put your dick in somewhere it didn't belong?  Confess it to Destiny every week on Date with Destiny.  Date with Density.  I put my dick somewhere, Density.  It's Destiny. 
[00:59:30]  I put my dick somewhere else this week.  Yeah.  How many times a week is that on?  That's once a week.  Tuesdays at midnight.  Oh, I'm sorry.  With rebroadcast.  Tuesdays at 2 a.m., 6 a.m., 5 p.m., 9 p.m., Saturdays at 7 p.m., and Mondays at 2 a.m.  Oh, okay.  That's easy.  If you're a fan of Date with Destiny, good luck trying to figure out when the fuck it  shows on.  Somewhere it didn't belong.  Is that like rape?  Yeah, yeah.  I put my dick somewhere it didn't belong, and I'm in jail.  It happens.  It's like to catch a predator.  Oh, Uncle Paul. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  Late Night Love.  These are the casual listeners that you guys will be picking up.  Yeah, that's true.  We're going to pick up a lot of perverts.  All the listeners from Late Night Love.  We're going to pick up a lot of kid touchers.  Great.  Thank you.  That's what we get from this company.  Thank you.  What is that, like love lines?  Well, everyone, have your cake and eat it, too.  Kieran and Kirsten will teach you how to.  Plus, he's the only man in the world with a penis insured for $1 million.  They spelled too wrong. 
[01:00:30]  They spelled too wrong.  They spelled it T-O-O.  We'll teach you how to.  It's not teaching you how as well.  It's the wrong to.  How also.  You can make that mistake on Twitter, but you probably shouldn't make that mistake on  your website.  It's not on the official description for your show.  What other shows are we going to get the overflow audience?  Sex Pro Adventures, which airs Wednesdays at midnight. 
[01:01:00]  Look out.  That sounds good.  And then rebroadcasts Wednesdays at 2 a.m., 6 a.m., 5 p.m., 9 p.m., Saturday, 6 a.m.,  Sunday, 4 a.m. and 10 p.m.  It's like someone just fired a shotgun at a clock.  They're all about just confusing the fuck out of their customers.  Yes!  I don't get it.  Someone's got those T-shirt cannons.  Yeah.  It would be better to say, I don't know, check your local listing for when the show is on.  Right, right, right. 
[01:01:30]  You can't just throw a whole bunch of different weird times at the fucking listener.  If mean bitch and you porn fucked and had a baby.  I love that analogy.  Oh, yes.  On crack.  On crack is a good one, right?  Okay, this is, again, grammatically incorrect because it's past and then future tenses.  Okay, so if they fucked and had a baby, it will be called.  Oh, God. 
[01:02:00]  What?  It would be.  I think the lady who answers the customer service calls is writing these descriptions.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It will be called Sex Pro Adventures.  Oh.  You, I'll be getting.  What?  It says, I'm reading this right, yeah.  You, I'll be getting the best of both worlds every week.  What?  It's you, apostrophe, I-L-L.  You, I'll. 
[01:02:30]  You, I'll.  That's an I.  You, I'll be getting the best of both worlds every week on Sex Pro Adventures.  Oh.  When's that on?  That's on Wednesdays at 12 a.m.  And then the rebroadcast is Wednesday at 2 a.m., 6 a.m., 5 p.m., 9 p.m., 7 a.m., 6 a.m.,  Sundays at 4 a.m. and 10 p.m. Eastern.  Okay, that's good.  That doesn't confuse anybody.  This would be good for, actually, for Anthony.  Chocolate radio.  Chocolatey ring.  Yep. 
[01:03:00]  Chocolate radio is where radio sex has been dipped in chocolate.  What does that mean?  Black shit?  Yeah, it's a black woman.  Okay.  So radio sex has been dipped in chocolate and into the dark places of your mind with Naomi  Banks.  That sounds kind of good.  With three X's.  Nice.  Triple X.  That sounds great.  These are the people we're going to be getting.  Yeah.  As opposed to Entertainment Weekly Radio, who will be getting our morning show audience. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, for sure.  Certainly.  And a bunch of them will leave us for good.  Just how it works.  True.  True.  We will absolutely lose listeners.  Yeah.  Didn't Jimmy have to go pee-pee?  I do.  Desperately, yes.  Yeah.  Why don't we just break.  We got Mark here, too.  And then we got...  Where's Mark Maron?  He's in the office.  Nice.  Mark Maron up next.  Stay there.  Epstein, stop playing with your testicles and look what I've done. 
[01:04:00]  This conveniently shaped vial contains an elixir which will increase the metabolism of anyone  who drinks it.  Can you imagine?  This could eliminate the worldwide obesity epidemic permanently.  No.  Let me see.  Well, I suppose if you're careful, there's just the one and... 
[01:04:30]  Say, this would fit perfectly.  In my hiney?  No.  No.  No.  It's in.  It's in my hiney.  Well, at least it's still intact.  Now, give it back.  Here you go.  No! 
[01:05:00]  My elixir!  It's all over the ceiling!  Epstein, you...  You...  Well, back to the drawing board, I suppose.  O.P.N. Anthony.  This is the O.P.N. Anthony Show.  I want to say good morning to Mark Maron.  Hello, fellas.  Mark.  Who's in the middle of a very interesting story.  I know, really. 
[01:05:30]  I would love to hear.  Well, I...  Well, I...  One of the podcasts we put up yesterday was live from Vancouver, and the way it was recorded  by some idiot up there.  I don't know.  There was a problem with it.  Like, it only came out...  Like, it only worked...  It won't work in mono.  It only comes out.  Whatever.  We fixed it, I think.  But the Vancouver show has got about...  Margaret Cho did about 10, 15-minute one-woman show on my dick to my face.  Really?  Well, you know, we had slept...  We fucked once.  Oh, you did?  Once.  Once?  Yeah.  You know, it was like right before I started seeing Jessica, the girl I'm with now. 
[01:06:00]  But, you know, she came over.  We did the podcast.  We were like, you know, we've been...  This has been sort of an elephant in the room for 25 years.  Yeah, should we do this?  She's like, yeah, maybe we should.  You know, so it was that kind of thing.  And it was good.  You know, it was like, all right, we got closure.  Was it awkward going into it?  Like, because you were friends first?  Was it awkward starting with the kissing, or did it just kind of...  I don't know.  Is it ever?  I mean, I think it was... 
[01:06:30]  You know, it was a couple of sex addicts getting some resolution, is what it was.  You know how that goes, right?  It's like, let's do it.  And, like, it went pretty well.  It was a little odd.  You know, when you realize you've known somebody 25 years, you're like, hey, we're just a couple  of middle-aged people trying to get something back here.  But what...  Wait, wait.  Wait, was there ever an attraction that was just building up over the years?  You know, what happened was once, years ago, when we were up in San Francisco, they did 
[01:07:00]  those Comics Come Home specials.  Sure, yeah.  The Dennis, we hosted the Cam Neely things, or he produced them or whatever.  And there was one year where I was literally just following her around.  You know, I think I might have still been drinking, and I was just like, I'm going to  fuck her.  This is going to happen.  You know when you've got it in your head?  It's not in their head at all.  Right, right.  But you're going to follow them around.  Until they see it your way.  Right.  So I was just all night, just like, hey, what's up?  You know, what are we doing?  What are we, you know?  To the point where I think I followed her to her hotel room. 
[01:07:30]  Like, I'm going to walk you back to your room.  We're all in the same hotel.  And she opens the door, and I walk in with her.  And she goes, she just looks at me, and she just kisses me on the mouth.  Like, you know, big old, you know, like tongues and everything.  And she goes, is that what you needed?  Are we done?  Oh, wow.  And I'm like, I guess so.  And that was it.  That was it.  So, like, this is a long time coming, is what I'm saying.  It's about, but anyway, so we do the show in Vancouver.  I don't think she's going to bring that shit up. 
[01:08:00]  And I'm like, what do you want to talk about?  She's like, I got this going on.  And she's like, maybe we shouldn't talk about it.  And I'm like, yeah, probably not.  I mean, you know, I've got a girlfriend now and everything.  Oh, no.  And we get out on stage, and right out of the gate, it's 10 minutes.  It wasn't a bad 10 minutes.  She was saying I had a big dick.  All right.  That's not bad.  Right.  So what am I going to do?  Please, could you not?  Hey, not going to stop talking about my big dick.  I would assume Mark's packing, because he has big dick guy confidence.  No, not really.  Really.  I think I got a fat one. 
[01:08:30]  You know, I think it's a good, it's got some girth to it.  It's not long.  I don't have any problems with that.  Well, who would she have been fucking before?  And that's really key.  Like, if she just came out of a fucking long-term relationship with an A.L.  I have no idea.  I have no idea.  It was embarrassing, though, because I don't really go, I don't talk about this shit.  Right, right.  Yeah.  So there I am in a live situation.  There's nothing you can do.  And she's like, oh, my, you know, for 10 minutes.  And that's the last segment you want an audio problem with.  Yeah, right.  The girls talk about how big your dick is.  Right, right.  So the thing goes out yesterday about, yeah, I don't know, not a lot of people, there's 
[01:09:00]  some problem with the, and they're writing me saying there's a problem, like, oh, my dick  fucked up the internet.  I can't wait to listen.  I fixed it.  Good, good.  It was embarrassing, but, like, again, you're not going to stop, so please, please don't.  Right, right.  Right.  She has, I only met Margaret once.  We don't know each other at all.  Is she sexy?  When I met her, she was really sexy.  She was warming up the Louis Anderson show or something.  This is, like, late 90s.  And she had really bigger tits than I thought.  She was really, she was sexy, man, yeah.  And that was the only time I ever interacted with her.  But I was like, yeah, I definitely see why people would like her.  Oh, yeah, she, yeah, she, she's definitely sexy. 
[01:09:30]  And, you know, she's, you know, she's out there, too.  She's, you know, she's.  Right.  She's a little out there.  Because she's one of those people, she's, you know, she's married and, I don't know,  you'll be, I think it, how it's shifted.  They had one of those relationships for a while and then they don't know.  I don't know how the fuck people do that.  No, no, no.  I can't imagine that.  Do you know, do you understand how people do that?  Open relationships kind of a thing.  What does that even mean?  I don't know.  What does that even mean?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  When you come home and go, how did you, how was everything today?  Well, I fucked that lady at work.  Right, right. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, good for you.  How was that?  Tell me about it.  Do you get a picture with your phone?  I mean, what do you do?  Yeah, there's a lot of people into that too, man.  They're totally cool with it.  Have you seen swingers?  Not an attractive bunch, by and large.  I don't know.  I don't know how you live your life that way.  It just seems to, like, then why be in the relationship at all?  I just don't know what the relationship is built on.  Right, right.  If not built on complete jealousy and shallow sexual attraction.  If you can't honestly go, who are you fucking? 
[01:10:30]  Right.  You know, with that amount of anger and anger, where's the love?  I do like the fact that they feel there has to be certain rules set up.  Right, right.  So it's like, you're not allowed to fuck anyone between 6 and 7 p.m.  Yeah, yeah.  Because they need some type of rules.  Right, right.  And no coming in people.  Right, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No kissing.  That's right.  You've heard that over the years.  Yeah.  And only I jerk you off with the left hand.  Right.  Don't let any other girl jerk you off with the left hand.  That's our special thing.  Those are our boundaries. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  You have to.  That's ridiculous.  It is.  It's stupid.  Mark, do comics thank you or what?  You showed them the way.  Every comic is doing a podcast now.  And you have to be the godfather of podcasting.  Oh.  You have to.  I remember years ago you were doing our show saying, I'm thinking of doing this thing.  Yeah.  Fast forward a few years.  Podcasting.  What is that?  Not only is your thing fucking huge, you know, they talked about it in the New York Times  and Rolling Stone and all this shit, every comic is now doing what you started. 
[01:11:30]  I don't know if they thank me.  And I, you know, I like to think that.  Do you feel good or bad about that?  It depends who you're talking about.  But, you know, and not only are they doing it, they really followed your exact fucking  format.  Well, Pete Holmes actually shamelessly says he stole my entire show.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Right.  But, you know, he says it to my face and then he laughs and you're like, okay, what  do you do with that?  I stole your show.  Ha ha.  I'm like, all right.  Well, I guess it's, but the truth, you know, this to be true as well is like no one invented  interviewing.  I'm just talking to people. 
[01:12:00]  So you're going to bring your own thing to it.  Right.  And I'd like to feel proud that I inspired a lot of people.  But in my mind, what they said was like, hey, fucking Marin can do it.  Anyway, it's not like he did a great thing.  Let's try to do what he did.  It's like, hey, that idiot.  He's been around for 20 years and I hope they don't think it's some sort of fast track  to success.  I mean, I just lucked into something.  My timing was good.  There were guys doing it before me.  You had an Air America gig and then you were kind of like just hanging out and then you  built this.  It's kind of cool to see it build from absolutely nothing into something that's really listened 
[01:12:30]  to.  But who was doing it before you?  Carolla, Kevin Smith.  Oh, well, Carolla was a radio guy that just moved over to there.  Jimmy Pardo, Jimmy Dore, and Todd Glass had a show.  So I can't claim to be the first podcasters.  Then there's podcasters before podcasters when podcasters were just guys in a building  that invented podcasting talking to each other.  And of course, they're like, we were the ones.  You didn't even listen to yours.  Fair enough.  But you brought it to a whole new level.  No, no. 
[01:13:00]  I think that I helped the medium.  And it's incredibly successful.  Yeah, we're doing all right.  You know, things are going well.  I need to know numbers.  Okay.  I can tell you numbers.  You will tell me numbers.  Like, on average, right out of the gate, over time, most episodes get between 350,000 and  400,000 downloads.  But that's over time.  So initially, they get between 250,000, 300,000 downloads each episode.  So your next podcast will definitely do 250,000 to 300,000 right out of the gate. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, give it a week or so.  I think it kind of builds.  And then people come back.  But then your fans are like, all right, well, now I want to check out a couple other podcasts  I missed.  Right.  And that's what brings up the other numbers.  Right.  And every time.  And I try to make them as evergreen as possible.  I mean, when I left Air America, you know, when we, they, well, that was the beautiful  thing when I hear you guys having management problems.  I mean, at least you're not on fucking terrestrial.  I mean, you know, you never know when, like those guys, the last gig I had over there,  I think I talked to you about this.  I was doing some streaming video show with Sam Cedar because they, you know, they agreed 
[01:14:00]  to pay the money I needed to get out of the divorce.  So I did that and they fired us and they didn't take our security cards away or our  office.  Now that's progressive politics.  It will fire the guys.  They're still on contract.  Let them hang around.  While it never happens.  Don't take the cards away.  But the best thing I ever did, I think, was get out of talk.  I don't talk about politics at all and just keep them all evergreen.  That's the point I'm trying to make.  So if anyone hears the show, they can pretty much go back to any of them and they're not  going to be dated.  They're not going to be. 
[01:14:30]  I remember when you were going through that.  I remember when you were going through that transition because a lot of people knew you  as a hilarious, but a political guy.  And I remember you.  Holy shit.  It took a long time to get rid of that.  Well, we were trying to we were trying to push on stuff and you could see like your lip  quivering.  You want to do it.  You want you were biting yourself.  But then you're like, no, man, I'm changing my whole fucking image.  And you did.  Well, it's just that, you know, there's no way no matter what side of the aisle you're on  there.  There's no way to be a divider.  There's no way you can't literally if you if that's your racket, you can't attract regular 
[01:15:00]  people from the right or the left because you're going to piss off both someone, you  know, I don't want to listen to politics and I'm progressive, but I want whatever.  Right.  That guy's a fucking liberal fag.  I'm not going to.  You know what I mean?  So I don't.  I just talk about the existential I just talk about the despair of being me, the struggle  of waking up.  Right.  Right.  Then politics.  So I can also have to do in politics for a year and a half or two.  You realize, like, I'm I'm I'm you're you're you're just carrying water for somebody that 
[01:15:30]  you know, no one's a genius.  You know, you're just regurgitating someone else.  Right.  Yes.  And then one day you wake up and you're like, I have no original ideas.  I just I've read all these talking points and I think I've been made them my own.  And then you get disillusioned with the whole process because you realize nothing gets done.  You read one book and you think you're an expert or three books or parts of them.  Yeah.  I would go to Barnes and Noble.  I was reading a political book every other week.  And I'm like, what am I what am I doing?  These are you're right.  They're not my thoughts. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, it's difficult.  You know, I realize I was a pretty angry guy no matter what.  So why not just talk about the, you know, the real shit?  I try to keep it because I think that, you know, existential fury is timeless.  Right.  Politicians come and go.  But the struggle of being you will remain until the end.  Yep.  Well, I'm not listening to a lot of podcasts, but I certainly listen to yours.  Mark Maron's podcast is great.  And you got to plug the book, too.  I didn't know you had a book until I literally walked in.  It was sitting on the desk. 
[01:16:30]  It's called Attempting Normal.  And there's going to be some book signings starting May 12th in Portland.  I guess go to your website for that.  Yeah.  Or Twitter.  WTFpod.com.  It's funny because when I wrote this book, I thought about you, Jim.  Because, you know, Jim would, you know, I'd see him at the cellar.  You know, he'd just be typing and always, ah, I'm working on my book.  But there's a chapter there.  Like, I thought about you and about being a comic and about, you know, what you write about.  And it's not a through line. 
[01:17:00]  They're essays.  But they kind of, they're the full picture.  And I literally have two experiences with prostitutes in my life.  That's a two.  And I'm like, you know, Jim would do this.  And he'd be like, yeah.  But, like, you would do a whole book on it.  You know, like, I've got two.  And I'm like, I've got to include those.  Sure, yeah, yeah.  Because that's what, you know, people want from us.  Right.  And they are the saddest fucking hooker stories.  The saddest.  Why?  Without giving.  No, I'm going to sell a lot of books for you.  You've got to know me why they're sad.  It's like, the reason I put them in is like, it was, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not a hooker 
[01:17:30]  guy.  I never was.  But there are these two fucking, like, one time, I'm in Boston.  I'm living in Boston.  I'm actually living with a woman.  Right.  She's out of town.  We live down by Symphony Hall, which is a shithole.  There's just, there's the dirty, horrible hookers there.  And that, you'd see him every day.  And that's the weird thing.  It's like, you walk by him every day.  I'd get up to park my car, to move my car at seven in the morning.  And one of them would grab my dick and say, you want a date?  I'm like, well, breakfast would be nice.  You know, what are you going to do? 
[01:18:00]  So one night, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm coked up.  I'm going home.  It's like two 33 in the morning.  And, you know, I see one of these hookers and she, you know, first a guy approaches  me, go, you want Coke?  And I'm like, no, I got Coke.  I'm good.  And he was clearly her pimp, you know, cause they kind of trail around.  And then the hooker comes up, you want a date?  And I'm like, all right.  Yeah.  How, how, how much is that?  She goes, $30.  I'm like, that's great.  Yeah.  Good one.  Right.  Old school.  Street hooker.  Right.  Yeah.  Damn.  And I'm like, great. 
[01:18:30]  She goes, where are we going?  I'm like, well, I live here.  Great.  I'll take you into my house where I live with my girlfriend fucking horrendous.  And we walk up like five flights of stairs by the second flight.  She's wheezing.  How far up is it?  And, and we get up there.  This is literally the first time I've ever been with a prostitute.  So we get up to this, to the, where the apartments five floors up, she's wheezing, you know, and,  and, uh, and we get in there and it's a futon on the floor.  And I'm like, so what are we, what are we, what are we doing? 
[01:19:00]  And she goes, well, get, you know, give me the money.  So I give her the money and I go, you want me to pull my pants down?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And so I lay on the bed, I pull my pants down and she starts blowing me and yet it's not,  it's not good.  It's not great.  It's just, it's just sad.  I can't, I can't transcend the, the sadness of the situation.  And then, uh, you know, she, she goes, uh, you want to, you want to, you want to play with my tits?  I'm like, all right.  She has 10 more dollars.  Oh, geez.  And she, and I have to pay her like with her, you know, with my dick out. 
[01:19:30]  So I give her the $10 and she takes her tits out and she, uh, she, she puts my hands on  them and I'm holding them.  She goes, do you feel a lump in that one?  Oh no, no way.  Swear to God.  And like, and I did.  And I did.  And I'm like, yeah, I think you might want to get that check.  It's like some, and somehow or another, yeah, somehow or another, you know, I was able to  focus and finish.  Wow.  Yeah.  That was the big, that's a big payoff.  But like in the middle of this, the saddest fucking thing was the, the phone, the phone 
[01:20:00]  rings and the machine picks up and it's the, my girl who I live with.  Hi, I just wanted to make sure you're okay.  Wow.  You had a lot of distractions there.  Just a shame vortex.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then I finished this horrible thing, you know, and like, and she's like, yeah,  I don't usually do this.  Of course, you know, I work with computers.  All right.  You might want to, you might want to go to a doctor, you know, I'm not, you'd get a second  opinion on a thing in your boob because I'm no professional.  Wow.  And then she like takes, you know, all the condoms off of my dresser says, can I have these? 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, please.  You better do.  And then I just went in and took a Silkwood shower.  Horrible.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then the other one, I guess, you know, this story, who cares?  Yeah.  It was the same situation.  I, you know, I was driving home in Boston.  I was late at night.  I'd been out with some of the guys.  I was coked up.  It must have been, who knows?  I don't know fucking what year that was.  87, 88.  Who knows? 
[01:21:00]  Cocaine's an awful drug, but it starts a lot of great stories.  Yeah.  Because, you know, like, first of all, your dick doesn't work really.  It takes a lot of effort on coke to get your dick to work.  And many times in my life on coke, I have masturbated for hours just to try to come down.  Sure.  You know, it's horrendous.  But it's been a long time.  So I'm coked up, and I'm driving in downtown Boston, the zone.  Combat zone.  Yeah.  And it's one of those, again, I'm driving.  I wasn't living with anybody then, but I'm driving.  It's like 2.33, and then it's late, and I'm driving. 
[01:21:30]  I'm like, I got coke brain, and I'm like, fuck it.  I'm going to get, I'm going to do a hooker.  And I think this was, was this, it was after this, so this is the second time.  I don't remember the order, but I see one, same type of thing, on the street.  There's no one out at that hour down there.  And I pull up, and I swear to God she said this.  I pull up, and I go, hey, and she goes, you want a date?  And I'm like, yeah, yeah.  She gets into my car, and she goes, I don't usually do this.  I'm just in town for my father's funeral.  I swear to God. 
[01:22:00]  I'm just in town for my father's funeral.  Why would I make that up?  Wow.  And I'm like, okay, I'm sorry.  Yeah, yeah.  So then we, I go, where are we going?  She goes, just pull over up here.  And I'm like, all right, fine.  So I pull over, and she goes, you know, pull your pants down.  So I pull my pants down.  I pull my underwear down.  She puts a rubber on my sad, limp Coke dick.  Just tries to wedge it on there.  And she starts blowing me, and I can't do anything. 
[01:22:30]  I can't get it up.  I'm in the middle of the street.  I got a rubber on.  I'm on Coke.  And within seconds, I'm surrounded by police cars.  Oh, shit.  It's like, lights, cops, action.  And I'm like, holy fuck, what do I do?  She goes, I think you should pull your pants up.  And I just pull my pants up.  She goes, I'll take care of this.  She gets out of the car and starts some drama with the cops.  She saved me.  My boyfriend was going to beat me up.  And I'm like, thank God.  It turns into an opera out there.  Wow, what a trooper.  Yeah, good egg.  And then a cop comes up to my car. 
[01:23:00]  And this is at a time where they would list you in the paper.  Right.  Like, if you were, yeah.  We used to read those.  We used to.  Oh, on the air?  Yeah, we were assholes.  I think I regret that one.  Right.  So there was something.  You're dicks.  Yeah.  Sorry, go ahead.  Well, no.  The cop goes, and he just looks at me, and he shines his light.  He goes, where do you live?  I go, Somerville.  He goes, why don't you go there?  And I'm like, I will go there.  But I'm trying to get a blowjob officer.  Right.  You know.  You understand.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What the fuck?  I paid for this.  So I drive off, like, just, you know, sweating and freaked out. 
[01:23:30]  And I realized that, you know, I hadn't pulled my pants.  I had pulled my pants up, but they weren't buttoned.  I hadn't pulled my underwear up.  So I looked down, and just my sad little dick with the rubber hanging off is, like, sticking  out.  Like, almost like, why do you do this, though?  Yeah.  Look, let's not do this anymore.  Oh, shit.  So those were the two.  That's bad luck, man.  Second time.  Second time.  That's telling you something.  No, I'm done.  I didn't.  Fuck.  But in the car on the street, it seems like it would be a little fucked.  That's how it always was. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  Another $30.  It was a $30 situation.  Wouldn't that be extremely nerve-wracking?  Yeah.  That's before the internet.  You didn't bring these girls home from the street.  You couldn't go on Craigslist.  Man.  You know, it's dirty business.  And it felt dirty.  Even that none of them, well, the first one went all the way.  It was not for me.  A lump in the tit and fucking cops.  And my father's funeral and the police.  Yeah.  Those are two fucking great ones.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they're in the book.  They're in the book.  The Mark Manners.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I had to put those.  That's a tribute to you. 
[01:24:30]  I don't know that I would have put them in.  What if I'm like, well, Jim would put this in?  If I didn't put them in, I would have fucking released a leaflet.  I had nothing else to talk about.  I'm a fucking flyer.  There's a lot of stuff.  There's stuff about the divorce.  There's stuff about my parents.  There's stuff about Viagra.  There's stuff about cats, guitar, pants.  I swear, I just got the book, too, and I just opened it up, and I opened it up to the chapter,  and I swear I didn't set this up.  I almost died.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Number one.  Oh, there were a few times you almost died.  Well, yeah, I should qualify that. 
[01:25:00]  In my mind, I almost died.  So these are not menacing.  I almost died, number one, Cleveland.  Yes, that's the airplane one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's when I'm pretty sure I almost died on an airplane.  Then there was another chapter in there where I'm pretty sure I almost died from the spicy chicken in Nashville.  Spicy chicken.  I almost died from mouth cancer that I thought I had.  So they're not menacing stories.  These are not stories.  Sure.  Are you normally a hypochondriac?  No, I don't. 
[01:25:30]  Who is it?  Well, I used to be bad because I can't believe I've never told you that story.  Have you never told you a story about how I cured the hypochondria?  No.  I'm not sure.  My dad, you know, was a doctor.  So, you know, as a kid whose dad's a doctor, there's part of your brain where, you know, in order to get his attention, I think I was sort of like, I'm sick.  Oh, there you go.  Right.  Right.  Because he's busy.  But if you're sick, he's like, well, let me have a look at you.  No, yeah.  Like, I was a sophomore in college, and I decided that I had, what was it originally? 
[01:26:00]  MS.  I was pretty sure I had MS.  Right.  So I start calling my father.  Like, Dad, I got MS.  He's like, well, you don't have MS.  I'm like, no, I'm pretty sure I got MS.  He goes, what are your symptoms?  I don't know.  Hands are tingling.  I don't fucking know.  He's like, you don't have fucking MS.  I'm like, all right.  I think I do.  But all right.  Goodbye.  I love you.  I think I do.  All right.  Goodbye.  I love you.  So I do that for about a week, and he doesn't bite.  And then I start with, I'm pretty sure I've got prostate cancer.  He's like, why would you have prostate cancer?  My ass hurts a little. 
[01:26:30]  I don't know.  My hands are tingling something.  Hands are tingling again.  He says, I don't think you have prostate cancer.  So I pester him for like a week, and then I go home for Christmas break after pestering  him like almost every night with the prostate cancer thing.  And I get to the airport in Albuquerque where I grew up.  It's like seven at night.  He goes, I go, where are we going?  He goes, we're not going home.  He goes, no, I'm taking you over to Bob's house.  And he's going to examine you.  This is his friend who's a urologist because he's a doctor.  They all know each other.  So Bob, the urologist, is going to examine me. 
[01:27:00]  We're driving from the airport.  My father drives to this guy's house, knocks on the guy's door, and the guy's getting  up from dinner.  I see he's wiping his face.  His family.  He's at the table.  And my father's like, hey, Bob, my kid thinks he has prostate cancer.  Can you take a look at him?  What are they going to do?  And he goes, all right, come on in.  So now Bob walks me and my father back to Bob's bedroom.  And I'm like, what's going to happen here? 
[01:27:30]  And thank God Bob got hold of himself.  And, you know, I'm standing there with these two men.  And he's like, you know, maybe he should come into the office.  I'm like, yeah, maybe I should go into the office.  So he doesn't, you know, finger bang me in his bedroom inappropriately.  So the next day or the day after, I go to Bob's office.  And the prostate thing, it's a gnarly examination, especially when they want to really check it  because they've got to put their finger in your ass, press on it, and then you've got to  milk some liquid out of the tip of your dick and put it on a slide so they can look at it. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, there you go.  Good morning.  So it turns out I got some sort of prostatitis, which is stress-related, genetic, whatever  the fuck it is.  It's a thing.  So I got something, which as a hypochondriac, you're like, huh?  I got this.  I told you.  Yes.  All right, right.  So he gives me antibiotics for this thing, and I take them for like a week or 10 days,  and then I still feel it, right?  So I go back to Bob, and he does it again, and he does the whole thing, and he says, it's  gone. 
[01:28:30]  You don't have anything.  I'm like, all right, I thought I felt something.  Okay.  So I go back home, and then before I go back to school, I see something on my dick.  So I'm pretty sure it's herpes, right?  So, but you know, I think it was just, I jerked off too hard, because I wasn't even  fucking really then.  So I see something, so I go to Bob, I call Bob's office, he goes, you know what, meet  me at the hospital.  So this is like, so I meet him at the hospital, he takes me into a room, he takes my dick out,  and he swabs this jerk-off sore, you know, and he tests, he says, you don't have herpes. 
[01:29:00]  And like three days before I go back to school, I'm like, I don't know, I'm pretty sure  that it's herpes or something, and I go back, this is a fourth time.  The fourth time.  Four times.  So I go back to Bob Rosen, and I walk in, and I'm standing there, I got my pants down.  You know, he's sitting in a chair, I'm standing up, he's holding my dick.  And he looks at it, and he goes, there's nothing wrong with you, do you like coming here? 
[01:29:30]  That was the end of it.  That was the end of it.  Oh yeah, between holding your dick and shoving his finger in your ass, milking your prostate,  it's like, maybe I do like coming here.  That would be something the guy would think, like, Jesus Christ, this guy.  That's funny.  That was the end of the hypochondriacal episodes.  Yeah.  No, I'm not really that bad with that.  You seem really happier.  I feel better, you know.  What's going on with you?  What changed?  Did you try something different? 
[01:30:00]  Not that you were miserable, but you had your moments here and there over the years on our show.  That's pretty miserable.  I think what happened was, you know, when everything fucking crapped out on me,  and I started the podcast without any real expectation, I was at a real low point,  that as people began to like it, when people, you know, not even on a business level,  just the fact that I was doing something on my own that people liked,  I think I finally got a little bit of genuine self-esteem and validation.  I think, you know, I don't know if it's happiness, but I feel like after working 25 fucking years 
[01:30:30]  and being nowhere for years, really, you know, not being able to sell tickets or whatever,  all of a sudden this happens.  You're like, all right, I didn't throw my fucking life away.  Right.  Yeah.  You got to feel a little better.  You know, I've still got problems.  I've still got a girlfriend that's asleep right now.  And, you know, you've got to worry about her waking up.  So you were feeling frustration over the years.  Like, what the fuck?  This should be, you know, better for me.  Well, I think I was consumed with, you know, a certain, you know, bitterness that I thought was, 
[01:31:00]  I think I romanticized bitterness.  You're like, I'm getting fucked, you know, and this is, why am I not?  And, you know, quite frankly, that's not attractive disposition.  Right.  That's what I learned.  I mean, you knew me.  I was a little more aggravated and, you know.  Yeah, you definitely seem more content.  I mean.  I exuded a certain negativity that I thought was like, come on, all of you feel this.  Big T.  You can't sell.  It's there somewhere.  I thought everybody must be like me in there.  You know, you just, I'm the only one being honest about how life is fucking us. 
[01:31:30]  And you should wake up and feel the sadness.  Nice.  That wouldn't be a good name for a special.  Yeah, right.  But I think what happened, you know, I still, I'm a little panicky.  You know, I mean, you know, things are going good this week.  Everything's sort of lined up.  I got the show starting on Friday.  It's on IFC.  What time is it on?  Friday what?  10 o'clock.  Friday, 10 p.m.  And I did 10 of those.  And I think they came out pretty good.  I like them.  I'm happy with them.  They represent me well.  It's, you know, it's a, it's a, it's a stretch.  It's about a guy whose career went off the rails and he starts a podcast in his garage. 
[01:32:00]  Well, where do you get that idea from?  It's crazy, right?  But, you know, I got certain people playing themselves as podcast guests.  And then there's sort of the backdrop of my life, which is, it would have been probably  based loosely on the first year or so where I just started doing it and me coming out of  the divorce, dating a bit.  There's a couple episodes with my father, who's played by Judd Hirsch.  And then, uh, wow. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  Two episodes with him.  And then I got, uh, you know, a lot of people play themselves on the show.  Dave Foley, Dennis Leary, uh, Garland, uh, Mark Duplass, Adam Scott, Aubrey Plaza, Ken  Zhang, uh, Bobby Slayton in a pinch at the end.  That was hilarious.  He's hilarious.  You know, you know, the pit bull, but it was, it was funny.  Like he's on the last episode.  Kindler plays himself and some of them integrate into the story a little bit and others are  just a few minutes on the podcast.  And, you know, there's just episodes in my life. 
[01:33:00]  I meet a girl, you know, based on the relationship I have now.  And I, this kid who plays my assistant, this Josh Brenner kid, he's funny.  Wow, man.  It's very involved.  Yeah.  It was a single camera thing.  You know, I'd never done that shit before.  It was very exciting for me because it was the weird thing about whatever's happening is I,  you know, when I started the podcast, I was,  in my mind, I was like, well, I finally, the actor, I had my ass handed to me by the woman  and she left.  There was part of me that's like, well, this shit, I got to, I got to realize who I am.  I'm not going to be a fucking relevant comic.  I'm not going to get a shot on TV. 
[01:33:30]  I'm going to do this and hopefully not die broke and have insurance.  Like I really let this shit go.  I was like, fuck it.  I've been humbled.  Just own it.  What are you going to do?  You got, you can't do anything else.  Plan B is there's no plan B after you're 40 fucking five years old and your brain is like,  well, this is bullshit.  I could always wait.  There used to be stuff in that folder.  There's nothing.  What am I going to teach?  What am I going to do?  So I'd let go of all this happening at all.  So it's all very exciting.  I'm very humbled by the whole thing.  You know, but I never shot, never wrote this. 
[01:34:00]  I never wrote television.  I never had the opportunity to act much.  Did you write the show and pitch it or did somebody say, hey, man, you ought to do a show or did  you say, fuck, this might be a good idea for a show?  Well, what happened was, you know, when you do comedy, if you want to be on TV, you got  to figure out hopefully your life turns to shit or gets better every few years or you  go pitch it.  But what happened is Jim Serpico over at Apostle, which, you know, he runs with Dennis Leary,  their company.  He liked the podcast.  So he called me in and he said, I love this thing.  Is there something we can do with it?  I'm like, well, I got an idea.  Let's do a show about a guy who does a podcast in the garage. 
[01:34:30]  He's like, all right, that's a good idea.  So he had a deal with Fox Studios.  So they put in some money to, we were going to, we decided to shoot a pilot presentation.  So Jim hooks me up with his writer, Duncan Birmingham.  We write this 15 minute piece to be like sort of a mini episode to shoot it and bring it  around.  We thought that'd be a good idea to bring out something to give a feel of the show.  So we shot that.  It came out to about 20 minutes and Ed Asner played my dad in that one.  Wow.  Yeah.  People are very available.  If they got the day to work, they'll work. 
[01:35:00]  You know what I mean?  I'm not doing, I'm not doing, I'm not doing, I'm not doing, I'm not doing, he wasn't  available for the, for the, for the, the series.  But, so we took it around, you know, and a few people passed on it, but IFC loved it  and they got behind it and they said, let's do 10.  So that's, that's who, that's how that happened.  That's where you are.  Wow.  Yeah.  Because of that presentation, Bobcat Goldthwait directed four of them.  And he, he also, would that be a spoiler?  Yeah.  He's in one of them.  That's all I'll say.  And it was an amazing experience. 
[01:35:30]  And when's the show on again?  IFC?  Fridays.  10 o'clock.  10 o'clock.  I want to make sure people check it out.  The first one is, uh, is about an internet troll.  It's me and Dave Foley.  And it's based on a real story, but it didn't go as far as it went on the show.  I can't fucking deal with them.  I can't, you know, I can't, you know, and that, and when they know that you can't deal  with them, then, then you're just vulnerable to it.  I, I, it really takes a lot for me not to sort of like engage a guy with three followers  for four hours.  Yeah.  Sometimes people, uh, they, they get on me. 
[01:36:00]  It's like, why would you even respond to somebody with fucking three or four followers and stuff?  I'm like, I'm not responding to him.  I'm using what he said as a vehicle to get my shit out there, you know, but it doesn't,  it rarely works because it never works because as soon as you engage, they're sitting at  home, you know, and their boxers going, ah, one me when you realize they'll never like  you, it makes it a lot easier because I think there was a time where I thought, wait, I  could turn this fucking person around.  What do you mean?  That's what I did. 
[01:36:30]  And then you realize, wait, I could, I could cure fucking AIDS and they're still going to  hate my fucking guts.  And when you finally realize that it's so freeing.  They'll always be there to hate you no matter what the fuck you do or, or, or even if you  change everything.  And you, and I'll tell you, you know, like some of your fans really fucking hate me.  I get, there's some guys that listen to your show.  They love me, but the guys that hate me that like you guys, they're, they're rough.  Half of them hate us too.  We're learning that they hate.  Oh, we get that too.  I blocked so many people onto, I have blocked so many fucking people. 
[01:37:00]  I don't even, I don't even deal.  I don't deal now.  Even the slightest thing, I just block.  It's, if they, it's, it's weird because sometimes I can just sort of like, I'm above this.  I'm not going to, I'm not going to respond to this.  Yeah.  And then you go look at how many followers you have.  Don't do it.  And then, but if they get you at the right time of day, you're fucked.  You know, you got a little time on your hands.  I want to dump some hate into this machine.  You know what I mean?  Do you know what helps, do you know what helps deal with them?  What?  When you think about it, how many people have ever walked up to you and said, hi, I'm so-and-so  from a message board or Twitter? 
[01:37:30]  Never.  Never once.  Oh no, no, once or twice.  Was it the guys that have been trashing you?  Not really.  No.  Sometimes, but you know, if you do call them on it, like if you do, like, it's a troll  culture now.  I mean, it's predatory, all of it.  All of it.  You know, we got patent trolls.  You know about these fucking guys?  This is why you're lucky to still be on radio.  There are these guys, literally, there's a whole patent troll industry.  What they do is they take software patents, the patent system's very weak. 
[01:38:00]  So these guys basically get patents on math problems that represent technology, and they  sue on them.  Holy shit.  They sue people that can't afford to litigate.  Like, there's a bunch of, like, Corolla is getting nailed with a suit and a couple other  podcasters, because some guy has the patent for podcasting.  All right?  It's a piece of technology about menuing in a sequence or something, and we don't even  fucking understand it.  But all of a sudden, they come after you, and they're like, hey, you owe us money.  It's a shakedown.  You know, give us some money to protect us from, protect you from us suing you. 
[01:38:30]  So that's a whole other fucking issue.  But it's a whole troll culture that, like, I don't even know.  I didn't even know that was going on.  It goes on in technology all the time.  The tech companies.  Well, obviously, Apple is always getting screwed by Samsung, who's getting screwed by this  guy.  Yeah, because they use some kind of thing that they deem proprietary.  Right.  And, yeah.  But in podcasting?  Well, that's the thing.  It's like, at that level, all those big companies, they own patents, and they protect their devices  like that.  And that's how Apple won against Samsung.  But the same law enables these fucking, these guys who have made nothing. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  You know, patent software, which is basically a math problem.  They built nothing.  And they can register it, and then go after a guy that can't afford to pay, you know, to  litigate, because it's hundreds of thousands of dollars to litigate patent suits.  And they literally say, like, you know, you want to license our stuff, or we're going  to sue you.  It's fucking complete mob task.  And how much do they charge their license?  I'm not going to talk to them.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  At this point, like, you know, some of us have gotten letters from these guys, we're inviting  you to license, and I'm like, what is that? 
[01:39:30]  And, you know, a lot of us are in touch with the EFF, the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  We're trying to figure out what to do as a community, because it's just, it's brutal.  You're literally threatening to sue guys who are working in their garage.  You know, some of us, you make a few bucks, but they went after Sam Seder.  He doesn't have a pot to piss in as a podcaster.  What the hell is he going to do?  What do they want?  It's fucking horrendous.  That's mob tactics.  It's all it is.  Complete extortion.  You're extorting money from people.  Wow.  Are they people that were doing the podcast before these guys had the patents, or no? 
[01:40:00]  Well, the way this patent thing works is, like, the patent was introduced in, like, 1996.  There's a whole world to it that I don't quite understand.  The only way to do it, you know, the patent system is, like, arcane.  It's, like, archaic.  And these guys have found this loophole, this method of shaking people down.  And they're just, I don't know how those fuckers sleep at night.  Do they have children?  Is that, you know, Daddy, what do you do?  I shake down guys, you know, with a math problem.  I make them pay.  That's how you're in school.  There's a guy that does a show in his toilet, and, you know, I make them pay me money. 
[01:40:30]  Jesus.  Fucking bastards.  It's just exhausting out there.  And, like, I don't, you know, it's a pending issue right now.  You know, there's about a dozen of us that got these letters, got a second letter.  You know, we're still here, and, you know, we're suing, they sued CBS and NBC for their podcast.  They sued How Stuff Works.  So what I was hoping is, like, all right, those guys got money.  Somebody crush this fuck.  Somebody fucking, yeah, yeah, yeah, take this guy on.  But normally they probably settle just to get rid of it. 
[01:41:00]  That's it.  That's the problem.  And the guy continues.  And it strengthens their bullshit patent.  Like, we just got a bunch of money from him, so you're kind of fucked.  No one's going to fight this fight for you.  Yeah, it's a president.  A president is set.  Holy shit.  So we don't, I mean, it's all just happening now, but the tech industry has been dealing with this shit for years.  These little companies, like some people who just have a website where they sell, you know, like, you know, like little sock monkeys.  Right.  Yeah.  They get a letter for, like, you know, you're using the on button. 
[01:41:30]  You know that that says process order button?  Yeah, that's us.  We invented that.  Here's a math problem that proves that.  Wow.  And they're protected.  Cocksuckers.  They're protected.  Fuck, I didn't know that was going on at all.  No clue.  Look it up.  It's horrendous.  But I don't think they've ever, you know, come after guys.  Like, they picked a bunch of guys on microphones.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So now we've got to figure out how do we not say something that's going to make it worse.  It's like, you know what?  I'm not going to sue you for the patent anymore.  We're going to sue you for slander, you fucking idiot. 
[01:42:00]  Wow.  But, like, I got freaked out about it, you know.  No shit, yeah.  Like, we had a meeting.  You know, I was, like, we put together a little community.  I wanted to see what the hell Corolla was doing.  Yeah.  He got named in the first suit.  So I say, Adam, I'm going to put a bunch of guys together.  We can talk about this.  It was funny, though, because we all go to Adam's house.  There's about ten of us, you know, Fitzsimmons and a bunch of other guys.  Freedom fighters.  Right, right, right.  And I'm like, you know, and I just want Adam to tell us what's going on.  And we get down, and he's like, all right, Maren, what's going on here? 
[01:42:30]  I'm like, what do you mean?  Yeah, we're doing it.  Yeah, what about you?  Someone's got to be William Wallace here, motherfucker.  That's right.  That's right.  I'm willing to paint my face with you, but someone's got to be William Wallace.  God damn.  So, you know, but, you know, we're all sort of in it.  We're all communicating.  It's going to be interesting because it's still, like, it seems like it might.  I don't know how some of these things, legal things.  What I was telling you, though, is that they get these patents.  Some of them are very old, and I'm not sure how it works, but, like, the patent for this 
[01:43:00]  part of the technology goes back to, like, 96 or something.  So they figure out a way to reintroduce it and kind of reframe it and re-register it.  So the reason they've got to have that backdate on it is that if you can find any prior existence  of technology similar and prove it, the whole thing goes to shit.  Yeah.  It kills it.  So that's called prior art.  But, you know, these guys know the language.  They know how to figure it out.  But this patent that they're trying to sue us on or they're threatening to can apply 
[01:43:30]  to anything.  So you've got two parts of your brain going.  You know, when this happens, you're like, fuck these guys.  We're going to take them down.  And the other part is, why me?  Go see somebody.  Yeah, go fuck with them.  Push them onto somebody else.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Get away from me.  That guy's got money.  I got nothing.  Wow.  Yeah, you don't want to indeed it.  That's the part you want to fight yourself.  Like, let's fight this fight.  Hopefully somebody will do it.  You know, it's beyond me how this country is just so litigious like that. 
[01:44:00]  It's troll culture.  You can't just be a fucking guy in a garage with a microphone having some fun and making  a few bucks without someone crawling up your fucking ass.  Right.  Really?  Right.  That's it.  It's horrendous.  And it doesn't matter what you do.  You're right.  It doesn't matter.  If it's not podcasting, it's fucking, you know, you have a carpentry shop and then the fucking  wood knot guy is fucking.  The wood knot guy.  It starts to be a knot in the wood.  Yeah, I patented that.  Wow.  I made the tool to get that out.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:44:30]  It's fucking horrendous.  For fuck.  And that's why I call it troll culture.  That's trolling.  It's all the same shit.  You're right.  Yeah.  On every level.  On every level.  Predatory.  What do you think is going to end up, where does troll culture go, you think?  Well, I just think that, you know, everyone's going to eventually be afraid to do anything  for fear of being attacked.  Everyone's going to have to protect themselves somehow legally.  It just seems like everyone is sick of it.  I think even the trolls are sick of it because they get trolled.  I think everyone is sick of the troll culture already. 
[01:45:00]  I don't know what happens.  It's like predatory and it's weird and it's cowardly.  And it's just maybe it's because maybe nobody, maybe the whole manufacturing basing like,  hey, we don't make anything in this country but assholes.  Like, I don't know.  You're so right.  I don't know.  I don't know what happens.  That's a business like this patent troll business on the tech level makes billions of dollars.  It's a business that, you know, that it's registered.  Like, you know, I just don't know where these fucking guys, how do they justify it in their mind? 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How do they have a conscience about it?  Like, you've got to rationalize a lot of shit.  You know, it's that same kind of, you know, death camp thinking.  You know, I was just following orders.  You know, this is just the way life is right now.  Right.  Is I do this.  I crush the little guy.  I mean, the patent system apparently was put into place originally.  Did you, what the fuck is the name of that documentary thing that that kid did?  Oh, fuck.  Whatever.  You know, it's put in place to protect people and encourage it.  Like, they put statute of limitations on patents so people who invented them could make a little money. 
[01:46:00]  But then it goes back into the world so you could evolve.  And then the competition makes things better and better.  You know what, you take from the past and, like, you make it better, you know.  And now these guys do this loophole.  So what they're basically doing is guaranteeing that we don't progress at all.  Yeah.  By making you afraid to, you know, you can't invent something.  Look what I invented.  That guy did that already.  He owed me money.  You know.  No, I want to use it as the basis of my new idea.  Fuck your new idea.  Give me money for the old idea.  Shut the fuck up.  All right, great.  That's what we do now. 
[01:46:30]  Unbelievable.  Fucking amazing, yeah.  Pricks.  God, we're scumbags.  Wow.  But, yeah.  Everyone's talking about the Fiona Apple podcast.  I was talking to you about this before the show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that was intense.  Can you tell people?  I have not listened to it yet.  Here's the issue with the podcast is that, like, my show, like, the most recent 50 are all there.  So for six months you get everything for free.  And then after that it goes behind a paywall and you've got to get there.  There's an app that's free and then for, like, eight bucks you get a premium app.  You can stream everything.  So you can get it there. 
[01:47:00]  But Fiona was, you know, I'd met her a couple times and, you know, we had talked before.  And, you know, she's a very talented person.  And, you know, sort of, like, a little kooky, fragile, but really a genius, you know.  And it was not really a controversial episode other than, like, I just got her on a good day.  She came over and she just talked, you know, and just was talking, you know, about her own insecurities and about her creative process and about hummingbirds.  You know, I mean, it went all over.  But it was funny, it was interesting because it was one of those interviews, and I'm sure you've had this happen, where about 45 minutes in you're like, I better bring this around to songwriting. 
[01:47:30]  Or people are going to think she's a little loopy.  Right?  Like, let me save you.  I'm going to fucking save you right now.  But I think it was...  We let that shit go.  No, I know you do.  And so do you.  I mean, you know you have gold.  You're like, holy fuck, she's talking out of her mind right now.  Yeah, but I do every...  Like, I think that some creative people are just like that.  And I bought her a new record.  And I got to be honest with you, you know, like, I liked her, but the new record, it's one of those things where, you know, when you listen to a record and it's so... 
[01:48:00]  There's something so raw about it that you're like, not only is this genius, but, like, I'm uncomfortable.  Wow.  You know, like, it was one of those things where, like, I have a certain amount of respect for people that it's not that they don't have a filter, but it's hard for them just to exist in the world because they're so sensitive and their creativity comes from this place where it's...  I mean, she doesn't go out much.  You know, she's not...  You know, she's a real artist, and, you know, and it's difficult for her. 
[01:48:30]  So I'm not there to make too much controversy.  But it just, I think it was just, it was one of those situations with my show is I think a lot of people have never heard these people talk at all.  Like, I got, you know, the guy from Dinosaur Jr., Jay Mascus?  Sure.  Like, he's, like, I didn't know that he was, he wanted to do my show, and I've been doing musicians lately.  And I'm like, great.  And I was excited about it because I love those guys.  I mean, I, he's a genius, that guy.  And I ran into Dave Cross, and I said, yeah, I'm interviewing Jay Mascus.  And Dave goes, good luck with that. 
[01:49:00]  And I'm like, what are you talking about?  Like, he doesn't talk.  I'm like, what?  Oh, shit.  Then why do you, you know, so, so it was one of those situations where I got, I'm going to do an hour at least.  I don't care what happens.  I'm going to sit there, right?  And we're going to sit there for an hour.  It's like therapy.  It's like a therapy session, but not in the sense that I'm doing therapy, but, like, we're on the clock for 50 minutes.  So if you want to sit in silence, we'll do that.  But somehow or another, you know, I got him talking about, you know, his dad, who was a dentist and skiing, you know, and it was like, Jay Mascus, he skis?  And it turned into something. 
[01:49:30]  So that's really what I'm looking for.  Yeah, the Fiona Apple, a lot of people were talking about.  It's a great episode because you really get a sense of who she is, and she's an amazing talent, that person.  And is she nuts, or is she just an artist?  Is she still good looking?  Yeah, she looks great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, she looks great.  And I don't know.  Like, it's tough.  I mean, maybe she'd be nuts if she didn't do anything.  Do you know, like, if you just met her on the street, and, you know, you're like, what do you do?  And then she drew you a picture and taped it on your head. 
[01:50:00]  I mean, but the fact that, you know, she's fucking Fiona Apple.  I mean, you know, she does these amazing things, like these amazing songs.  So, yeah, I don't know that she's nuts.  I think what you get is, if I do what I do right, you get sort of a portrait of that person.  You get a sense of who they are as a person, and, you know, that's the best I can do, really.  Yeah, you pull things out of people.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  I think people want to talk, you know, generally.  Well, Mark, this is a pleasure.  I hear you.  They're telling us you've got to go. 
[01:50:30]  You've got to tell us that you have to leave.  I've got to do one of those, you know, those junkets, you know, where you get on, like, you know, when you're promoting something.  A lot of people, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Where you're just on the phone with a moderator, and you're doing morning radio shows, and they just, you do one, and they come back on.  All right, this is Nashville.  It's Joe and the Fat Guy.  You're going to be talking to Joe.  The Fat Guy is laughing.  And then Terry will occasionally chime in if someone says something filthy.  Okay, here you go.  That was the fucking goof we did on Louis C.K.'s show. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  Louis was doing one of those calls on his show.  Minneapolis.  And we were the radio voice on the phone.  And it was like, hey, Louis, how you doing?  Just not caring, paying attention.  What?  So what are we promoting?  The What the Fuck podcast.  People know about that.  You've got the big show on IFC.  Dead podcast.  Wait.  Dead Possum is the episode.  Oh, it's the episode.  Okay.  That's the second episode, and they put it up at IFC if people want to watch it. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  And that premiere is on Friday.  At 10 o'clock?  Yeah.  10 o'clock IFC, Marc Maron's new show.  I'll be in Milwaukee, too, on Saturday.  This Saturday at the Pabst Theater if you want to come see me.  Fucking speaking of Milwaukee, the detective died.  We haven't talked about it yet.  Oh.  All right.  Pat Kennedy?  He's dead.  We just had him on.  I didn't know that.  Jeffrey Dahmer's lead detective, the guy that was there from day one, and one of the  only guys Jeffrey Dahmer really talked about.  He came in.  He had a book or something.  It was a book, right?  No, it was a documentary. 
[01:52:00]  Right.  He was awesome.  This guy was like 6'8", with a mustache, old cop, old Milwaukee cop.  Oh, that's sad, man.  I could have talked to him for hours.  He dropped dead of a heart attack.  We loved him so much, we couldn't wait to have him back on.  I guess we can now.  I hate hearing about people dropping dead of a heart attack.  Terrible.  Once you hit your late 40s, you're like, oh, shit, that could happen.  Right.  You've got to add another thing that could happen.  Second-guessing meat.  Now you better not.  When you're little, the only thing that could happen, really, is you get run over while 
[01:52:30]  you're riding your bike.  But as the years go on, oh, fuck, now that could happen.  More things to the checklist.  Anything could happen now.  Well, pretty much in the anything could happen.  Yeah, exactly.  But you said Milwaukee, and it reminded me of Pat Kennedy.  He was such a nice fucking guy.  I had not heard that.  Remember we were talking about his dick on the way home?  Yeah, he had a giant hog.  Me and Jimmy were laughing our asses off, because he came in here with tight jeans, and I'm telling  you, this fucking guy was packing.  Really?  Oh, dude.  Isn't it weird when you notice that as a guy?  Yeah.  But it makes you laugh. 
[01:53:00]  It makes you laugh, but you giggle.  This part of you that wants to say something, like, what's going on in your pants?  What is that?  What does that even look like?  I'm not gay, but can I look at that?  But anyway, it was a stretch.  You're playing Milwaukee.  It just made me think of that really fast.  And Mark Maron's new book, Attempting Normal.  I'm fucking reading this one.  Thank you, guys.  I don't read a lot of the books that come in here.  Yeah, I think you'll also learn more about me.  You'll probably call me up and go, you okay?  Yeah.  I just read the thing.  This one I'll absolutely read.  I'm a fucking fan of Mark Maron's.  Absolutely.  Always have been.  Yeah.  It's great to see you guys. 
[01:53:30]  And we talked off air, but I really am sorry about last week.  You were caught in the crossfire just because our fans started, like, fucking really giving  you the business.  The fans are very understanding.  They always take everything at face value.  You scumbag.  Oh, my God.  You disloyal, horrible man.  Long story short, you were caught in the crossfire.  You treasonous.  Yeah, yeah.  How dare you?  And we apologize for that, all right?  So, look, I apologize for causing any aggravation.  I love you guys.  It's great to talk to you. 
[01:54:00]  Had nothing to do with you.  All right.  Thanks, man.  Mark Maron, everyone.  Steven Lynch coming up next.  Yes.  Goofy gags to play on your uncircumcised pals.  Funny things to do with foreskin.  One was you put fucking a little crazy glue around the rim,  and you put it around an exhaust pipe, the foreskin,  and then you drive away.  Fucking pull the skin aside and dump rock salt in there.  Clean that out, you fucking baboon cock.  One was itching powder and the fucking thing,  and then you staple it shut on top.  Dirty fucking European dick.  You stand a fucking uncut guy against the wall,  and you lay on your back, you put your feet on his thighs, 
[01:54:30]  and you grab his foreskin with both hands,  and you pull it up to your chest,  and you let it snap like a window shade.  And it will actually make the noise.  I like to fill that skinny fucking fleshy pouch  with crushed glass,  and then fucking smash my fist up.  Goofy gags to play on your uncircumcised pals.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hit the bricks, crusader dick.  Now, the Opie and Anthony Show continues. 
[01:55:00]  Busy day today, huh?  It is.  I was just catching up with Stephen Lynch  and realized he didn't go to the bathroom.  Just sprinting back and forth.  Yeah, Stephen was just in here,  but he had to leave the studio to put his guitar case outside  because there's just not enough room in here.  And then he goes, he's like,  didn't you guys used to have, like, a big performance space?  I'm like, oh, yeah.  Yeah, we did.  Yeah, thanks for mentioning that today.  We had one.  I think we reached our bitching quota already for today. 
[01:55:30]  Stephen, you want to leave your coat outside?  There might not be enough room in here.  Your jacket?  Anything?  Your shoes?  I want to get rid of these picks.  Yeah, the picks might take up a little too much room  for this giant studio we have.  We decided that as our careers continue  that we need to, like, get into smaller and smaller spaces.  Yeah.  We call it more intimate.  Yeah, why keep expanding?  That's stupid.  That's exactly how my tour is going.  Right, right.  I like more of an intimate setting.  We had this amazing setup  where we had bleachers and a performance area 
[01:56:00]  and just state-of-the-art lighting.  You can't get personal in front of thousands of people.  So I like a more intimate few hundred people setting.  Right, right.  You know, I like seeing the faces out there.  Yeah.  I don't like those big spotlights just, you know,  making the audience look black  so you can only hear tens of thousands of them.  Yeah, you leave them wanting more.  Right, right.  If you will, you used to, you know, 
[01:56:30]  like last time I was here, I did Carnegie Hall.  Right.  This time it's a more intimate space.  Oh, where are you going to be?  The Gramercy Theater.  Oh, right.  So it's 40.  40?  That's fine.  Because I wanted an intimate show.  A lot more intimate.  That Carnegie Hall show my in-laws still talk about.  Which one?  The Carnegie Hall that you played.  How many years ago was that now?  I think three years ago.  You did fucking Purple Rain, man.  I did.  Holy fuck, and it killed.  And they still talk about it. 
[01:57:00]  I brought my in-laws.  Really?  We had a blast.  But he did fucking Purple Rain.  That's great.  And they got a little choir out there.  Yes, you were all in.  The band.  Man.  I was proud, because I remember back in the days,  just drinking beers.  No one knows anyone in this studio yet.  So now it's more of a stripped down.  The show itself has gotten twice as big.  It's like streamlined.  It's just the audience is streamlined. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, it's not.  Streamlining the audience.  When you take three years to write a record,  you tend to lose a couple people.  Why did it take three years?  You've got to build them back up.  Why did it take three years?  What happened?  I don't know.  I just sort of stopped.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I said, I'm tired of this.  I hate all this stuff.  I hate this stuff.  I hate what I do.  I hate everything I've ever done.  There's a period of self-loathing.  Yeah, yeah.  What am I doing?  And then I woke up and went, oh, fuck. 
[01:58:00]  I've got to pay my mortgage.  Oh, fuck.  I better write something.  But, you know, I actually like this stuff now.  Fuck this self-awareness crap.  I'm broke.  Yeah, yeah.  But what did you do for those three years?  Performed a little bit, but just kind of took time off?  Yeah, I did a couple shows.  I did some European things, and then just sort of...  You stepped away.  ...lazed about.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What were you doing, though?  Fishing?  Listening to music and trying to figure out what I wanted to do with myself.  And then I'm pretty much doing the exact same thing.  Right. 
[01:58:30]  That's what it all comes down to.  Sometimes you have these moments where you just kind of assess yourself and think, how  am I really contributing anything to the world and myself and that?  And then you're just like, ah, fuck it.  I could buy a Velociraptor from my yard.  Which he did.  Fuck it.  Who cares?  Which he did.  Oh, yeah.  I had to.  And it's pretty awesome.  I had to.  It's pretty awesome.  How's the compound?  It's very nice.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm having the pool worked on.  It was, yeah.  So the pool's getting worked on.  It should be open by next week, so festivities begin, like, next week. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, yeah.  It's that time of year.  Yeah, yeah.  Summertime is...  Oh, get out of the house.  Your backyard looks like a rap video.  Yeah, it's great.  I've seen the pictures.  I've never been there, but I've seen the pictures.  Oh, Stephen, you've got to come over, because it's a lot of fun.  The winter sucks, though.  You know, you think, oh, it'll be nice.  You know, it'll just close up the backyard, and, you know, it'll make me look forward to it.  And I just spent some quality time inside.  I got my fireplace, so I could just hang out.  Within a week, you're just like, fuck, I missed the pool. 
[01:59:30]  So you've got the jacuzzi, and the parties, and the barbecue.  You've got to build a fucking structure around that pool.  What do you mean?  Like a dome?  Yes.  I don't think so.  You own your house.  You're allowed to do that, right?  Oh, yeah, sure.  You're allowed to do that?  Yeah, you own your house.  Ha, ha, ha.  Permits, what?  Fucking variances.  Just build it, and wait for them to come.  I had to get...  Just move to Miami.  Yeah, well...  You guys can do the show from there.  Surely there's smaller spaces than this room in Miami.  Yes, of course.  Not many smaller spaces than this place.  When I was trying to get my pool put in initially, they were like, well, yeah, you can put your 
[02:00:00]  pool in, but it's got to be here and there, and it just took forever.  And they're like, well, you've got to have a fence around your yard if you've got a pool.  I'm like, I know.  Yeah, I want to put a six-foot fence up.  Oh, you can't do that.  What?  We can only put a three-foot fence up.  You need a variance for a six-foot fence.  But I put the pool...  You're saying I need the fence, but I can't have...  I've decided on a six-foot fence.  Yeah, in other words, pull out your checkbook.  Because you have to pay for these, you know, to submit these permits and things. 
[02:00:30]  And what's the difference between...  It's like, wait a minute, didn't I buy this house?  Didn't I buy this?  What's the difference between a three-foot and a six-foot fence?  Three feet.  No, but they're stupid minds.  What do they think?  I guess the kid jumping over.  You know, they don't want fucking Tommy Lee's house over there.  But three foot is good enough, right?  No, six foot you need for a pool.  Wait, you wanted three originally.  No, no, I just wanted a six-foot fence.  And they said the town doesn't allow six-foot fences.  I was like, but you allow pools.  Yes.  And you need a six-foot fence for a pool.  Yes. 
[02:01:00]  But you don't allow six-foot fences.  Yes.  You have to apply for a variance.  Yes.  I was like, what the fuck?  And then my neighbor had like...  I guess there was too much square footage of closed space in his house.  So he had this beautiful house with pretty much a carport in it without doors on it.  So they went through the inspection.  He bought the house, did everything.  And then he decided, I'm going to call some construction workers over, have the fucking  wall put up and have garage doors put up.  Right.  So he did that.  Someone ratted him out. 
[02:01:30]  So he had to, again, get a variance, which means money, and then get statements from his  neighbors on all sides that it was okay that he had a garage.  Jesus.  No!  I am against garages!  Harumph, harumph!  Yes, I'm with Greenpeace.  Yes.  So, you know.  I go through the same thing.  Do you?  Yeah.  I live in a historic neighborhood.  Oh, that's got to be easy then to do things.  No.  Yeah. 
[02:02:00]  It's like a 110-year-old house.  You can't move that rock.  Do you know that Ulysses S. Grant once looked upon that rock?  Can I put a DirecTV dish on the house somewhere?  Very few places that are out there.  Not historically accurate.  Wow.  Did Washington have a DirecTV satellite receiver on his roof?  I think not.  Rejection.  Rejected!  He's wearing, like, the old powder wig and fucking shit.  Rejected!  Stephen Lynch, you are a heretic.  What?  Hear ye, hear ye. 
[02:02:30]  I want a fucking better mailbox in my yard.  What am I?  I'm not a heretic.  You're going to be in the stockade.  Yeah, the stockade in Town Square.  He tried to get a fence.  He shall be drawn in court at noon.  That's got to be a bitch then.  Fucking historical.  They don't want anything changed.  Unfortunately, I haven't really wanted to do anything.  Right.  There you go.  I don't anticipate there being some problems.  Yeah, yeah.  They really don't like that.  They'll be up your ass.  Even when you live in those, like, condominium developments and stuff, they have the Homeowners 
[02:03:00]  Association.  Got to deal with those assholes.  Well, me and my dad and his girl there, Corey and stuff, we lived in one of those complexes  once for, like, you know, six months until Dad didn't pay the rent or almost burnt the  place down, bypassing the electric meter because he didn't pay the bill.  Something like that.  So, but we used to get these letters.  The Homeowners Association frowns upon 15-foot-high CB antennas on the roof of the building because 
[02:03:30]  my dad, drunk at 2 in the morning, had to go, hey, breaker, breaker, it's the Paisano  Cowboy.  Who's out there?  Meanwhile, everyone's TV would go, when he keyed down.  Was he really the Paisano Cowboy?  He was the Paisano Cowboy.  How is that not your radio name?  I should be the most...  Is that not your radio name?  Hey, you got the Paisano Cowboy.  Well, you know what's starting today?  I'm the Paisano Cowboy.  I don't think the listeners are going to let that one slide.  I was the Wrangler.  I was the Wrangler.  Yes, of course.  And Diamond Dust.  No, no, no.  We don't have to. 
[02:04:00]  Diamond Dust.  This is not about me right now.  Why did you do that to me?  Yeah, the Homeowners Association was always frowning on everything.  One time our electric got shut off and my dad decided to get these lanterns for the  house.  But they weren't the Coleman ones, the gas ones.  That are really nice, kind of high tech.  They got very bright and stuff.  He got those old red ones that, you know, the guy in the caboose swings so another train  doesn't hit him.  And hung them on the hooks that used to hang actual 20th century electric lights. 
[02:04:30]  And when he lit these, they're kerosene.  Jesus.  The black soot that came out of this went on the ceiling and just turned the entire ceiling  black.  I'm coughing like a fucking Pennsylvania coal miner in my house at 15.  Did the Homeowners Association frown upon that?  They frowned upon open flame lighting in the house.  And it was a shitty house and they still had a homeowners association?  It was a condos.  Yeah.  They were, they were, they were shitty condos, right?  Yeah.  They were your basic stacked on top of everything.  Condo complex. 
[02:05:00]  Uh, but oh boy, did dad, uh, I even knew when we were signing the lease, there was this  woman and man and they were old and they had just bought the fucking condo and they decided  they're going to make some money by renting it.  And my dad was good, man.  He came in, it's all smiles and everything.  And they didn't even know they're old.  And I remember this arthritic woman, her, her fingers were all twisted and she's trying  to hold the pen and the lease is in front of her and she had a little spectacles and  she's like the less sore or the less see needs to, and my dad's just laughing and I'm just 
[02:05:30]  like, and even at that age, I'm looking at them going, Oh, you poor motherfuckers.  You don't even know you're not getting your rent.  This place is going to be fucking trashed by the time six months goes by.  You really are making a boo-boo.  Uh, what, what kind of history, uh, happened in your area that it's historic?  I'm, I'm obsessing about that.  Yeah.  You said you live in a historic area. 
[02:06:00]  No, not a history.  It's not like, you know, there was a civil war battle.  Oh, not in, I live in Gettysburg, Kalamazoo, the old part of town.  All right.  Okay.  Where they, so the historical society is like, well, just because it's old, it means something.  There's some houses on the block that are pretty sweet.  Yeah.  That, you know, the, the big wigs and the community built, you know, in the late 19th century.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  So, yeah, they're pretty serious about it.  Nice.  Why did you, why did you choose there?  My wife is from there and I went to school there and know a lot of people. 
[02:06:30]  Are you in Kalamazoo?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  We got out, we sold our place last year here in New York.  We are official.  You're back to Kalamazoo.  Coming home.  Stephen Lynch.  Coming home.  My bathroom on the first floor, bigger than this room.  Whoa.  Well, I'm not saying much.  There's a lot of rooms in this fucking building bigger than this room.  Storage closet.  Wow.  That's pretty cool.  I was just pointing out how small my bathroom was.  Oh, okay.  I thought you were bragging. 
[02:07:00]  Wow.  So Kalamazoo, that's, do you find that takes you kind of out of the mix of like L.A.  or New York or, oh, oh, yeah.  Why do you think I'm not playing Carnegie Hall this year?  Nobody fucking knows who I am anymore.  Steve, man.  I love it.  I get to start fresh.  Yeah, yeah.  Start all over.  I don't like the diehards show up.  From your roots in Kalamazoo.  Yeah, we're sort of starting anew again.  Yeah.  Which, you know, I kind of dig it.  Are you just on the road doing gigs or are you working on it? 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You ever know a girl named Melissa Stetton?  What's that?  She's from Kalamazoo.  No.  That's my ex.  Oh, really?  Fuck her.  She'd always talk about Kalamazoo or something.  Everyone from Kalamazoo.  Isn't Jeter from Kalamazoo?  Is that why your eyes narrowed when I took Kalamazoo?  Yeah.  Kalamazoo.  You started twirling the other little muscle.  Derek Jeter's from Kalamazoo, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  Oh, that's pretty cool.  Derek Jeter, Stephen Lynch, and Bitch.  There you go. 
[02:08:00]  Jimmy, he took three years off.  Did you really?  I mean, I didn't really take three years off.  I just didn't produce anything in three years.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  I wasn't doing any mutes.  We made a career out of that.  Yeah, exactly.  Damn, welcome.  Welcome to the world.  Part of it was intentional.  Why?  Another part of it was like, I just don't know what to do anymore.  He was sort of at a crossroads.  Yeah, I hit a wall.  I was just like, the well is dry.  Wow.  Yeah.  And then the well filled up a little bit.  Yeah, that's nice.  And I managed to write some new stuff.  Well, you're writing songs.  It's probably harder because I can go out and try a new joke one night and feel fresh or a couple of new jokes. 
[02:08:30]  But for a new song, you've got to have new music.  There's a whole, it's got to be a whole, you know, it's a song.  It's a lot more than just one or two lines.  Yeah, yeah.  You have to have a concept and a beginning and a middle and an end.  When did you realize you hit the wall?  Like, what happened that you're like, I can't fucking do this right now?  Well, I finished a tour and I came home and I was like, I'm going to take a few months off.  Relax, enjoy my summer.  Oh, boy.  And then I'll dive back into it.  Yeah.  And then I just never dove back into it.  No diving happened.  Yeah, I just sort of looked at my piano and said, I don't know what to do with this thing. 
[02:09:00]  Wow.  Wow, damn.  What changed?  Like, what changed from the way you used to create to that?  Did something change or switch or nothing?  It's just, you know.  Were you kind of freaking out?  Like, oh, my God, nothing's coming to me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, I sort of embraced it at first.  I was like, well, it's not meant to be.  It's not meant to be.  And then, you know, you look at your bank account.  Yeah, yeah.  It started to move down and we moved into this new place, which was expensive.  Oh, man, yeah.  And we sold our other place and it got to the point where I was like, I have to get out on the road. 
[02:09:30]  No shit.  If I do that, I have to come up with something new.  And so I have to force myself to write.  And did you write any real shit first?  Like, oh, that's terrible.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  This is called I'm Forcing It.  Hope you enjoy it.  Hope you enjoy it.  Forced humor.  This is called All Filler.  My new record, All Filler.  Yeah.  Wow.  It's called Paying the Bills.  What do you do with the lousy ones?  Do you ever do anything with your lousy, awful songs?  Or the lousy paragraph that you thought would be a song or one verse that never became a song? 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  I usually play them on stage.  Oh, you do?  Okay.  That's my act, Jimmy.  I don't know if you've seen it.  Pretty much every shitty song I do, I play on stage.  No, sometimes I'll play it just to see if I'm right about how shitty it is.  Right.  And I usually am.  I'm a pretty good fucking judge.  And then sometimes I'll play it when I'm just in a mood.  Yeah.  Like, fuck you.  Have you ever had a suck on this asshole?  Has it ever worked the other way where you had a shitty song where you thought you tried out and they fucking loved it? 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  And you just didn't see it?  Yeah.  Which one?  It's happened a couple of the ones on the new record.  Really?  I didn't think we're going to be...  And they ended up fucking killing.  Yeah.  One in particular I put on the record before I had even played it live.  Wow.  And it was a live performance that we did at the symphony space uptown.  And it fucking killed.  Wow.  And it was probably the biggest laughs I got.  Wow.  So, you never know.  Yeah.  You gotta throw everything at the wall and see what sticks. 
[02:11:00]  So do you feel back in the groove at least?  Yeah.  Okay.  I love the bowling song.  I know we bring it up every time we hear.  That grew on me, yeah.  But I do.  I fucking love it.  That grew on me.  We beat the shit out of him the first time he played it for us.  Yeah.  Well, you know how it's a thing now that people shout at us.  It is a thing, but I do love it.  I get that.  And it's funny and blah, blah, blah.  And so sometimes I have to fuck you to the audience.  I'll go, okay, you really want to get it?  You want it, you asshole?  Let me play it.  And then after two minutes of just dead silence, I go, you still want this song?  Still want it?  Because I'm going to fucking finish it. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  Maybe I'll even add some shit to it.  Yeah.  I'll add some even more obscure bowling references.  I love it, though.  I absolutely love this song.  Hell yeah.  But it doesn't work out for anybody.  I just feel dirty and bad afterwards.  And they're kind of like, we just wanted to shout it.  You abused your kids pretty much.  We just wanted to make fun of us for shouting it.  Yeah.  We're all in this together.  You know, we've known them 14 years.  Damn.  99.  Wow.  We figured it out.  Yeah.  That's a while.  God damn.  Fucking 14 years.  Are you touring internationally, too? 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  You do?  That's got to be fun to go out and do gigs in Australia or whatever.  Yeah.  No, I just picked Australia.  The first country I thought of, it starts with A.  That's like, you'd think Europe would be first, man.  I know.  Well, Africa was the first one.  Africa.  I said no.  Must be great to play Myanmar.  Yeah, you're right.  That was silly.  How about Benghazi?  We'll move into the fucking bees.  You play Scandinavia a lot.  And those shows are like, you know, they're an aggressive people. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  And they're all big.  Right.  Tall.  Good-looking people.  And they just, they chant and they stomp their feet.  And it's a really sort of weird situation.  But they speak, of course, flawless English.  Of course.  So they get it all.  Yeah.  That was what I was worried about the first time I went over there.  It's like, oh my God.  I'm going to Stockholm.  They're just going to stare at me.  Yeah.  What's he saying?  Are they doing all the words already from YouTube videos?  I was going to say, YouTube really pushed your career forward.  Yeah.  Because people discovered you all over the world. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  That's pretty fucking cool.  And open up all sorts of markets.  Yeah, yeah.  I see those cell phones in the audience.  I used to, you know, be like, what the fuck are you doing?  Just watch the show.  Now I encourage it.  Yeah.  Like, put this shit online for me.  I don't have to do it.  All right.  Makes it a lot easier.  I mean, it's going to ruin all the jokes, but who gives a shit?  They're songs.  They can sing them anyway.  Yeah, they're enjoyable anyway.  Even if you know the punchline, it's still like, I kind of, I like the fucking, the way  you sing.  Your voice is amazing.  It's still enjoyable to listen to.  Absolutely.  Are you guys going to play today? 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  That's why I brought these guys.  Nice.  I brought the band.  The band, man.  Man.  Who's the band?  This is Courtney J. She's a Nashville singer-songwriter.  Hi, Courtney.  Hi, Courtney.  She's touring with me.  She's all over the new record.  Oh, I thought that was your wife.  No, no, no.  Oh, hi.  Hi, hi.  And then this is Charlie King, who plays banjo and harmonica.  I know, Charlie.  I took a few road trips with Charlie back in the day.  Yes.  This is good because I wasn't sure what the relationship was there, so I was taking a  little sneak peeks at her and stuff, so now I could, like, kind of look and gawk. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, okay, good.  You can ogle for you.  Yeah, I could ogle and oogle and gawk.  She's ridiculous.  She's very pretty.  She's ridiculously hot.  Let's just get it out there so we can move on.  Steve is like, she's a beautiful lady.  Let me tell you.  Let me tell you, folks.  Beautiful lady.  Let me grab my mic.  It's a great way to introduce her.  This is a lovely lady.  Lovely.  Lovely.  Let me introduce you to this foxy lady here. 
[02:14:30]  How long have you guys been singing together?  About a year.  Okay.  I went down to Nashville to record the studio portion of the new record, and I told the producer,  I was like, find me somebody to sing with, because I want to do, like, this Graham Parsons,  Emmy Lou Harris vibe.  Nice, yeah.  So find me, like, a really sweet, angelic, female voice.  And so he brought Courtney in.  I know who to get you.  Oh, wow.  Exactly what he sounded like.  Actually, that's what he sounded like. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, I love that shit.  Hey, the little lady lived down yonder.  Yeah, well, I do recall once we had a little lady in her voice like a goddamn angel.  I wasn't recording this in a shack.  I was like, oh, hold on, the stills are making a noise, and it's picking up on the microphone.  We've never been to Nashville.  I just assume that's how it is down there.  Still hanging out of his mouth.  Yeah.  I went to Nashville once.  Oh, you did go down there with Jill. 
[02:15:30]  Jill.  I haven't fucking been.  Yeah, it was fun.  It was fucking, the bar scene there is unbelievable.  Yeah.  It's fucking cool.  We're just going from bar to bar drinking.  It's cool town.  The new CD's called Lion.  I see that you've got a live CD and a studio CD.  Yeah, it's a double CD.  That's pretty cool.  I couldn't decide what to do, and I think a lot of people like their comedy with laughter in it.  Yes, of course.  You know, it sort of annoys me.  So I did what I wanted to do, which is go into a studio and, you know, make a real record.  Yeah.  And then I did all the same songs live. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, wow.  That's smart.  So now you can listen to whatever you want.  Oh, it's the same song, but live.  That's a unique idea right there.  That is a unique idea.  Studio version.  Yeah.  That's how I just explained my fucking CD.  I was like, oh, no, it was a studio version.  But they're like, why is there no laughs on that?  I'm like, you don't get it.  A comic goes in there to a studio and just does it?  No, it was in front of an audience, but I just needed to fuck.  You don't get it.  Yeah, it's the thing.  That's real funny, Steven.  And the name of my CD is You Don't Get It.  So you sang country, or did you sing something else? 
[02:16:30]  I'm a solo artist.  I sing alternative country.  Okay, which alternative country?  Not music row.  Not Toby Key.  Not.  Yeah, yeah.  It's kind of crossover.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I had a deal with Island Records and Universal Republic, and now I moved to Nashville, and  I'm self-releasing stuff.  You have a very nice speaking voice, so it's, I guess, helpful to sing her.

We can't even see him anymore.  He's behind the TV.  Yeah, he is. 
[02:17:30]  It's the only spot available for him.  We set these guys up in the lobby.  Maybe you guys just play by the elevators.  It's so embarrassing.  It really is.  We wanted to show Steven Lynch, our old friend, that we're doing well.  Oh, well, we fell miserably at that, didn't we?  We should have rented a bigger space today.  Yeah.  No, this is really our place now.  It's quaint.  Yeah, isn't it?  Oh, great, quaint.  Oh.  Unicorn, butterfly, angel wings, inner thigh, queer tattoo.

[02:19:30]  That's a cool tattoo.  Sir, that's a cool tattoo.  You got a comedy mask, got a tragedy mask, any fucking mask.  Then you must have asked for a queer tattoo.  Give me your most queer tattoo.  Your child's name, let the words be strong.  Would be beautiful, but they spelled strong wrong.  Yeah, they spelled it strong. 
[02:20:00]  Your stupid kid, now be strong.  How the hell did they get that wrong?  Man, weren't you watching when they put that shit on?  Say ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.  Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.  Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.  Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.  Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.  You love your laughing Jesus tat.

[02:21:00]  Got a queer tattoo.  A theory of the queer tattoo.  And by queer, I just mean bad.  It wouldn't mean gay unless you had a pink triangle on a rainbow flag.  With a bear wearing leather and a red ball gag.  Oh, that's a queer tattoo.  A literally queer tattoo. 
[02:21:30]  A literally queer tattoo.  A little girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's a girl who's 
[02:22:00]  jesus that was really fucking good that sounds great it's great see it sounds so much better  oh yeah that's really sweet yeah your voice is amazing sweet thing that um is so wrong with the  lyrics yeah do you guys write serious songs too or do you only do comedy like you because you  could you make a living doing i have written a couple serious songs but they will probably  never see the light why not i would imagine i would have to you know bear my soul songs about 
[02:22:30]  loving and losing people yeah yeah i want to do that uh still i'm sure you could do it and  listening to you would be it would sound awesome thanks well you know if that comedy well does  indeed run dry again like if i go back to dip and there's just a bottom then you have to start  you're gonna see me you know grow a big beer put your coffee shops put your life out there though  oh god that'd be terrible do a chris gaines was that his name all right yeah no ed gain 
[02:23:00]  start making lampshades out of people's skin and singing in coffee houses on the weekends  that's a great song man yeah comedy well ran dry  fuck you no i think i think i'm back that's a great thing i figured it out  but i actually like the songs on this record which is very unusual for me because i usually  it's the cd is lion by steven lynch of course that was tattooed where where do they get it  your website where's the easiest place dot com itunes amazon wherever how long has it been out 
[02:23:30]  came out in uh the end of november okay so it's a few months yeah yeah you guys want to do another  one yeah should we yeah sure yeah all right we'll just do um that one  do you steven do you write all of it or do you have help writing let's do this one okay no no yeah  it's just me sitting in my basement all by myself i'm getting a request i'm getting a request for the 
[02:24:00]  night i laid you down oh the night i laid you down all right we can do that one that's what we're doing  oh that's what we're doing oh look at that wow wow i thought we were doing that one damn all right so  this is a well i'll just play it you ready chuck  we were young maybe 20 you wore a white dressing gown 
[02:24:30]  drinking wine and dancing slowly on the night i laid you down 
[02:25:00]  in the moonlight revealed your body as the radio played some old phil collins song  and we believed in something holy on the night i laid you down 
[02:25:30]  we had love we had love in our eyes we had passion in our souls  there was fire in our kisses but it was not a phil collins song 
[02:26:00]  it might have been like mike and the mechanics don't know who that is yes you do he was the other guy in  genesis i'm pretty sure i'm pretty sure that it was phil collins no it wasn't on the night 
[02:26:30]  it wasn't on the night i laid you down  anyway anyway it doesn't matter doesn't matter we made love we made love until the dawn 
[02:27:00]  two hearts beat two hearts beating was all we heard oh boy here we go besides that oh there was  fucking no phil collins song well i'm positive it was that song from the movie with the jam box  i didn't say anything that's the one who the hell mixes up peter gabriel with phil collins well  fuck you i guess i'm no expert no you're not 90s music 80s whatever on the night 
[02:27:30]  i laid you down  on the night  i laid you down  that was very tender yes very tender phil collins you guys have a very uh 
[02:28:00]  nice voices together play the drums in the song oh yeah anybody know phil collins i never heard of  him he actually asked to do something for me and i i turned him down like i don't care if you're  drumming i think you could call in that favor in the middle of your sweet vocals he could go  exactly right at the end yeah yeah do you have a version where you don't say  fuck because that could easily get regular radio play oh well i mean 
[02:28:30]  we could probably figure it out you know take the  fuck out i'm saying that's a really good song it really is it sounds great god damn  and we i don't know what can you say on the radio anymore who knows we met out we met phil collins  once he was an asshole he was yeah he might have been having a bad day and i loved genesis  growing up and i finally get to meet the guy and he was so annoyed that we wanted a picture  maybe he was having a bad he might have been going through uh  fucking divorce with no prenup number seven  well he loves getting fucked in court oh jesus turn on he might have just heard peter gabriel's new 
[02:29:00]  record yeah yeah is it good no i have no idea what a literal idiot i am he's making a joke and i  stopped all the fun while kidding aside how is it on itunes yet god what an asshole  i should have interrupted the song are you guys really a couple  you seem to have a good relationship why fight over the one song exactly  what's wrong with the love making more important counseling might help 
[02:29:30]  why rehash it all again to music yeah it seems like you've worked it out  so where uh what have you done in the in the past you were singing and uh yeah um i put out two  records and i'm about to put out another one oh yeah a new record mason next tuesday oh are the  records you put out in this kind of vibe what you're just saying no they're they're good music no  yeah it's real music does serious play any of your stuff yeah uh i've been here before whoa yeah 
[02:30:00]  i've i i see royalty statements that say serious on it wow royalty really those must say like 0.0001  cent what was your biggest song uh it was a song called can't behave we have that iraq i'm looking  it's about the teens in detroit see what i did there i made it a racist joke it was a long time  ago though it was in 2005. i saw it as more of a teen joke oh okay yeah it's sort of the mainstream 
[02:30:30]  medium or hey so what about uh what's this new record what's this uh it's more like a 70s inspired  pop country album oh nice like glinda ronstadt dolly parton oh cool yeah those are my heroes i just heard  jolene on my ipod the other day i'm a big dolly parton fan so good i like two dolly parton songs  that's great song yeah she has a slower version and a faster version which do you prefer uh i like  this i like the the studio version i don't know which one you would say probably the faster one oh 
[02:31:00]  okay yeah i prefer the slower one well kind of like the song we have a little difference yeah there you go  we should have her sing a song separately oh jesus what else look at steven's like hey  i saw steven look at don't be like you  this is my time  i'm only here once every three years just give me this yeah i want to  no no i would love to have her play enough enough with this every three years 
[02:31:30]  shit i told you i was off the grid all right i was off the grid i wasn't really anything we  miss us i've been hearing about you guys though since we started yeah together so i've been excited  to meet you i remember speaks very highly of you wow i remember when we first started it's not true  i remember when we first started on satellite and you know we used to do afternoons when we were  really really close and hanging out and i remember when lynch comes in here with beer like everything is 
[02:32:00]  still the same dude i know it's six in the morning dude right oh yeah those remember that you're  like what the fuck's wrong guys great we would drink like fucking maniacs yeah well beers behind  the monitor of my computer and just be drinking during the show i mean let me ask you something  you guys are on satellite radio right yeah so does it matter if you're on at six in the morning or at  two in the afternoon not really every class which is good yeah not really every play i guess yeah  you could replay the live a lot of people yeah but in the afternoon if we did an afternoon show 
[02:32:30]  they'd be like well your topical you know morning show stuff is that i know believe me right yeah i'd  rather get up a little later and you get the people that used to come in in afternoon you know  the degenerates don't wake up until yeah later in the afternoon so yeah i think we get better guests  in the morning though like more because they're around doing the morning show circuit front we get a lot  of them right from good morning but you're not going to get a girl that could shoot ping pong balls  out of her place you're waking up at yeah that's a great point they're not crack at dawn type folks 
[02:33:00]  she's in shock yeah that might have happened yeah yeah back in the old yeah a lot of stuff might  have happened yeah yeah we had a lady that was able to throw eggs from her uh yeah wow and we would  hit him with baseball bats well actually it was an easter uh event and she would throw the eggs out and we  had a blind guy with an easter basket try to catch the eggs and then we did batting practice yeah yeah  we were very impressed that's amazing yeah it really was amazing do you not do that kind of thing 
[02:33:30]  anymore no no what happened we did it look at what happened i know we've had a long three years too  well yeah we sat back we assessed we don't do shit no we had a fun contest recently mars wrote down a  number and we all had to guess what the number was wild we had to go through the lawyers though  just in case we guessed the same number how would that litigate in court yeah we do color of the day  that's good yeah that's oh i guess after the whole you know big well that's that's what what what the 
[02:34:00]  our thing yeah the church st patrick's thing no when we went to satellite we were we didn't miss a  beat we were doing a lot of that's right i remember you still were doing and then slowly but surely  there were a couple of instances when uh that woman died from drinking the water at a radio contest  and that made everyone go well you can't have contests anymore all right and then no nudity  her bladder i mean yeah yeah exactly we should also stupid bladder replies there too oh god yeah we 
[02:34:30]  don't do shit anymore no i just felt all the energy get sucked out of the room yeah yeah that happened a long  time ago god we want to do we want to do more but oh yeah i don't know whatever what the  fuck i really want to get this fucking steven lynch cd for real oh yeah i was just saying that the  plug rails thank you we got one copy and i'm taking it to be smart i'm taking it all the rest of us  will download it i'll get you some i'll download it we used to have a blast at like bar nine when we 
[02:35:00]  used to all hang out down there fucking jay moore would show up and and my brother and we'd just get on  stage hammered yeah and just sing all drunk it's great to sing any song you guys would sing any  fucking anything if he would yell shit out your brother knew pretty much every song yeah he knew  anything and you could sing fucking anything you don't do that anymore right uh or do you guys do  now we get the band back together we still as a matter of fact we'll be playing on may 18th at 
[02:35:30]  mexicali live in jersey are you serious yeah rot gut i know yeah we we just we figured we'd do  probably like four a year so we got together rehearsed we got such a pisser just rehearsing  because it didn't matter anymore it wasn't like yeah man total fucking lack of dedication you're  late for practice what the fuck you broke a string and now you're fucking going through your  fucking case trying to find one oh another pick you need a pick you know the pick is fucking  and now it's just like we laugh we hope the other bands have attitudes so we can see that you have 
[02:36:00]  four shows a year yeah that's it it just doesn't matter you guys are on this exact same career  trajectory as i as you are this is it's uncanny it's uh four shows a year you just don't give a  shit and you don't give a fuck it's just there's a certain freedom to not giving a yes which is which  i think makes our show ten times better than it used to be because i used to be all crazy about it  and now it's just like let's just go have fun and see what happens we used we used to show up at gigs and it 
[02:36:30]  would be like uh why is this fucking band going on at fucking 11. we were supposed to go on 11.  right and then they strike the fucking kit we're not gonna play in front of this  fucking god hey they fucking dropped us on the sound of lights we look like  shit and fucking settled and now it's just like i don't fucking care right who cares now i'm gonna go  no electricity fine who cares i'll sit in the middle of the audience good we'll just do an acoustic  show it'll be great unplugged just that's it i don't care anymore i don't care nice yeah 
[02:37:00]  come back to see rock fucking you know you make a mistake like that it's a fucking showcase show  there could be a fucking record guy out there really is there it's also important it's not  isn't it it's not and he doesn't care that the guitarist missed one fucking note on your shitty  original right which he's taking a leak during right right he doesn't care uh you guys want to do one  more you could do an old one a new one you could do a fucking cover i don't know no no once again i 
[02:37:30]  i'm literal jim what the fuck's wrong with me i apologize i don't know i'm just believing what a  gullible douche i turned into turned yeah it's up to you whatever you guys want to do now let's do  let's do the other one which one this one is it off the new record oh okay you think yeah is it off the  record this one's a little faster because those are such ballads okay got it you know what i mean 
[02:38:00]  all right there's a song about our we travel you know as a community of vegans and that's what this  song  what the fuck is that that's it this showcase is over you're out of here you know if you're not gonna  fucking practice your shit you're out of the band fucking only as strong as the weakest link weak link 
[02:38:30]  the song why you think i'm talking so you can tune this isn't a real conversation you make us get  another banjo player  vegan living so healthy and clean 
[02:39:00]  so much brown rice so many mung beans  and no meat 
[02:39:30]  not one bite of meat  juicy meat  succulent meat  instead i get gluten and seaweeds do  the rice milk and lentils and 
[02:40:00]  fucking tofu  i respect every creature from horsefly to cow  but i'd blow a goat for some bacon right now  yeah i'd blow a goat for some bacon  right now  you eat your southern fried chicken and 
[02:40:30]  well i'll just have fruit  how's that t-bone  i'll just suck on this turnip root  with a couple chickpeas  kill me please 
[02:41:00]  i'm tired of  hummus and bulgur wheat  tofurkey tofuck yourself i want some meat  i respect every creature the birds and the bees  but i'd eat the  believe me i'd fuck up that whopper 
[02:41:30]  i'll just have fruit with cheese  i'll just have fruit with cheese  No meat, no meat 
[02:42:00]  No meat, no meat  How about the sprouts and a red beet  A handful of trail mix, mmm, what a treat  How about some soy yogurt served in a bowl 
[02:42:30]  I'd rather eat a hobo's asshole  Yeah, I'd rather eat a hobo's asshole  That says it all  Are you guys really vegans? 
[02:43:00]  No, I'm doing it  No, Jimmy, we're not  That's part of the joke of the song  Do vegans like that song or do they find it offensive?  Or do they kind of relate to it?  I have no idea  I can't imagine that they would give a shit, really  They're a hypersensitive group  Yeah, that's true  It's true  Oh, I'm sure they don't like it at all  It's not even accurate  Yeah  They're like, we don't eat that  It's not accurate  Oh, they do  I did research for that motherfucker  You did research 
[02:43:30]  I didn't know what vegans ate  You know what vegans eat  I'm thinking, they don't eat meat  But they don't fucking eat anything  Tofurky stinks  Yeah  It's awful  They try to have those cute names like that  Tofurky and  Oh, have a knot dog  What?  A knot dog?  A knot dog  Oh yeah, I came up with one once that I don't think they have yet  Fake ham, sham  I was like, this is going to make me a million dollars  If I buy a fake meat processing plant  Yeah  I'm not going to make any sham  What's in a knot? 
[02:44:00]  What's in a knot dog?  What's in a knot dog?  I don't know  It's tofu  And the seasoning  But it looks like a hot dog  That's the problem with that shit  Tofurky and a knot dog  It can't make it look like the delicious other version of it  In a burger that just isn't a burger  No  Like that, could you put this on the grill but keep it separate from the burgers  And put that  And then it's just like fucking broccoli chunks have fallen out of it  What is that? It's not a burger  Stop it  It gets you so angry  Big fucking corn is popping on the grill 
[02:44:30]  Is that like a veggie burger?  Oh, a veggie burger is stink  Every once in a while  Not too bad  Your burger is popping  Yeah, I think your burger is done  Popping, yeah  That's great  No way  They don't eat honey  What?  Because it's bee labor  Bee labor  Bee labor? Stop it  That's what they say  Nothing with animal labor  Honey sometimes they'll eat because it's what the bees like to do  I've heard honey at times they will eat  Oh  I thought it was any animal sort of byproduct  I guess there are various degrees 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, like I think they say that honey is something that bees are making  And it's not  It's part of  There's a reason they are okay with honey some of them  Right  From what I know, yeah  Damn  Yeah, it just seems very difficult  I guess they discuss it with the animals  It's bad enough like when you're dating a vegetarian or something to just go out  Like, oh yeah, where do I want to go?  I want to go to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse or something  It's like, oh right, that's right, you're a pain in the ass  Yeah  Or you go to  They have sides at Ruth's Chris  And they always sit there and go  No, no, wherever you want to go  It's fine, it's fine 
[02:45:30]  No, I know I'm a vegetarian, it's fine  And then you sit there and they pull up the menu and they're like  Ah, psych  Ah, yeah  Let me have three  Is this that girl from Kalamazoo again?  I was going to say  That's your girlfriend from Michigan  Let me have three orders of  Mac and cheese  No, no cheese  Vegetarians  Vegetarians can eat cheese  Oh, I couldn't stomach a vegan  They'd be eating fucking  I love vegetarians with an asterisk  Like, I'm a vegetarian  Except I eat bacon and I eat fucking cheese  Yeah  Fish and chicken 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, yeah  Exactly  Just no red meat  I'm a vegan, where the fuck would you even go to eat with a vegan?  French fries, no  There's vegan restaurants in New York  Potatoes have eyes  Why?  I don't  No, you're getting it wrong  I don't see that  I don't see  No, I would assume they don't  But maybe they do  They have eyes  Nothing with a face or family  Shut up  Oh  I don't know, man  I couldn't do it  How about a good lead pez, you fucker  Sometimes you have some good  I've eaten a couple vegan restaurants that were good 
[02:46:30]  But in New York you can get that  But like a lot of places on the road, it's fucking impossible  Yeah, something tells me in like Tupelo  You're not getting a good vegan place to go to  What you want to eat here?  That guy again  When he's not running the studio  Hey, Doug  When he's not running the studio  He runs a vegan restaurant  Vegan restaurant  We do have to take a break, unfortunately  That's right, we serve all kinds of food here  We got the vegan food  What you want there, Tofurky?

No boyfriend, no husband  Nice  That's how that shit works  I'm a smooth motherfucker  I warned you about this in the car  I told you this is going to happen  Yeah, but watch  There's probably a reason she doesn't have a boyfriend or husband  And it's the atomic bomb  There's nothing you can do about it  She's gay  Oh 
[02:48:00]  I know, I didn't think so  I was just testing  Cause I don't want you to tell me that after  Hi, do you think we can  No, no, I'm a lesbian  Now watch her say that anyway  Yeah, exactly  And I believe it  Oh, okay, really?

[02:52:30]  I'm the Mac in a bag  Give me something  I guess we lost one of these little fellas, huh?  Criss Cross?  We lost Chris?  Yeah, we lost Chris.  What happened?  From Criss Cross.  He's not a little fella anymore.  No  Well, first of all, he's dead  Yeah  You're kidding  He was 34  Living in Atlanta  What happened?  Possible drug overdose  Oh, man  For Chris Kelly from Criss Cross  Let's listen to some Criss Cross  That's enough 
[02:53:00]  Oh, yeah  Criss Cross  One hit wonder, right?  Officially?  For them?  Of course they are  Did they do it at the playground?  No, that was another bad creation  Oh  What do you mean?  What was the name though?  Criss Cross had a few  Yeah  No, they didn't  Jimmy, were you working that during the break or?  Nah, she's really nice though  But she had  Courtney J 
[02:53:30]  She's very pretty  She's really beautiful  But she's fucking  She can really sing  And they sing well together  I was talking to Steven  I'm like  Why don't you guys  And it's not like  I don't love the comedy stuff  Because I do  But I'm like  You could do other songs too  Like you could do comedy shit  Because I'm like  Some of this stuff  With one word difference  Yeah  You just take out a curse  And it could get regular radio play  Don't you think that's the same  As someone coming up to you and going  No  Jimmy, why don't you do this  With your comedy act?  No, because he knows  With a songwriter  It's different  It's not like 
[02:54:00]  Hey, the jokes don't work  Obviously the jokes work  Yeah, yeah  Not you should do this instead of comedy  But like  Why don't you do this in addition?  Because as a songwriter  You love writing comedy songs  But there's also other  There's no songwriter  That doesn't want to write  Like serious songs too  Like  With comedians  We tell jokes  And then there's times  Where we want to say serious shit  But we really can't do too much of that  Yeah, yeah  That's the same thing  Like  That would be almost like  If there was an opportunity for me  Just to say serious shit on stage  I would love it  That would be great  But you just can't do that  Yeah 
[02:54:30]  With a singer you can do both  I think he also  Let the cat out of the bag a little  When he said  I don't want to open myself up like that  Right, right  Emotionally  I think he means it  Like a real good songwriter  Has to kind of  Really put yourself out there  But he's a really good songwriter  Steven Lynch  That's why he's lasted so long  Yeah, yeah  There's a lot of people that do goof songs  That come and go  But the structure in his song  No shoehorning  Which is also important  No, man  The structure is amazing  Yeah  I mean  It's got the chorus verse thing  And if they're torn 
[02:55:00]  I feel like they could  Every once in a while  You know, they're feeling it  And like, hey, let's just  We're going to do a real one for you guys  Boo!  You think?  I don't know  Or is it an encore or something?  I don't know  Just throw it in there?  Yeah  Who knows?  What do we know?  We're not in that world  Maybe like Joe Piscopo's fucking song  About his chick there  Remember that one?  His serious song?  That was really nice  Yeah  He's doing comedy  And then he fucking sang  Holy fuck  His little song  Dude, three million people watched  Inside Amy Schumer last night 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, it was a bomb  Wow  Biggest premiere of the year for Comedy Central  Comedy Central's best premiere of the year  Way to go, Amy Schumer  She's also  There's fucking Amy billboards in Times Square  Apparently the subways are plastered with Amy stuff  Damn!  So Comedy Central's doing it right  So Comedy Central's doing it right  Kenny pointed out the Amy Schumer billboard on the way in today  Yeah  Huge Times Square billboard  Wow  Imagine getting support like that  Jesus  No, I can't  It's so nice  They really like committed  It's great  Remember we had a Times Square billboard once 
[02:56:00]  Oh my god  It was fucking  I mean, look  It's a Times Square billboard  We were so mad at CBS  We were ready to go across the street  So they pulled out all the stops  And then we find out like years later  That the only reason we got a Times Square billboard  Is because they own all the billboards  They owned it  Like two days in between real ad campaigns  Right  Because I was like, holy fuck  We got a Times Square billboard  They made our WOW sticker into this huge billboard  Yeah  And I was so excited 
[02:56:30]  And I remember like  I forgot who was in town  But I wanted to show them the Times Square billboard  It was a mere two days after they told me  And we went down there and it was gone  And I was so embarrassed  Because I come out of the subway  And here it was  What?  Sopranos on HBO?  Right  But I was thinking they really stepped forward  But no, they had a couple days  In between campaigns  And they threw us up there  Do you remember  CBS gave you a TV commercial 
[02:57:00]  Where they didn't have you in it  It was just text  And it only ran for one week  Yeah  Yeah  And then they taped another one  And it never aired  And I don't know  You got Madison Square Garden  That was XM  Right  XM for the most part  Always did the right thing  XM was, yeah  After ELO came aboard  Pluses and minuses from XM  There's a lot of pluses there  You're never going to get a perfect score  Oh, no, no, no  That was great  Compared to, you know, Sirius  Changing our fucking channel number  By the way, people  Yeah 
[02:57:30]  Well, they heard the promo  Yeah, the promos are running  Oh, good  They're finally running  Yeah, everything's good  Oh, good, right on schedule  They've been on hold for how long?  Yeah  They weren't officially scheduled today  But then we bitch and complained  Of course they were  And that's why we bitch and complained  Because it gets things done  And why weren't they scheduled for today?  Because they're stupid  And when would they have been scheduled for?  And what's the thought process  From not playing them from weeks ago?  When they first knew that this was going to happen  They don't have an answer  Or they do and it's a bullshit answer  They said it was starting today 
[02:58:00]  Yeah, they said it right after we bitched  And nothing was in the log  About those starting today, so  They are now  Yeah  You want to hear it?  Let me hear it  It's a real comedy of errors  You don't want to hear it?  I don't care  I haven't heard it  That's fine, let's hear it  The second sounds  We're reorganizing things  To make it easier for you  To discover what you like to listen to  What?

[02:59:00]  I noticed that the filming of Jaws began 39 years ago  I just happened to have watched Jaws for the first time in a while  The other night it was on  Yeah  And you know how we always talk about how that movie holds up?  Uh huh  It does except for the fucking head popping out of the boat  And the leg  Yeah  Yeah, well  Those two scenes don't  I mean  You don't like the leg falling?  I kinda like this  The scare factor is still there  But the head popping out was kinda cool  Eh, look at it again  It's so, like, phony looking 
[02:59:30]  It's so phony looking  It was more the shock of it coming out  Of course, the shock is still there  But the actual  Yeah  They would make that look even fucking more real  Yeah  And the leg is like  It looks so  The shark, too, doesn't look real  I mean  It looks pretty mechanical  Yeah, but back then it was  When it's under the water  Oh, when it's under the water  It's great  Just below the surface  Holy fuck  But when it pops up and it's chewing  And it's like  You know, it looks very mechanical  And when Robert Shaw said  He'll never go down with three hats on  It wasn't hats 
[03:00:00]  He went down with two hats  His barrels, Jimmy  No, he was wearing hats  Oh  He had shark fedoras  And he put one on his fin  He'll never go under with three hats  Three hats  They got a lot of great actors in that movie, obviously  But they were so lucky to have Robert Shaw  Yeah  His performance in that movie is ridiculous  Yeah  And I know Roy Scheider  Got the fire extinguisher chief  But his performance is just over the top unbelievable  Yeah, how great it is  Tremendous  Tremendous, right? 
[03:00:30]  And then again, Dreyfuss  Richard Dreyfuss is so great at being naturally  Yeah  Like, he's such a good actor  Yeah  And Scheider, they were perfect  It was perfectly acted  Yeah  He's so hateable  I love him  Oh, so great  He's great  Like I said, some great actors  Strung up by their Buster Browns  But Shaw on that boat giving that speech is just unbelievable  Yeah  Gives you chills how good it is  Yeah  Yeah  No distress signal had been sent  Sent 
[03:01:00]  He smiles sent  But just how it goes from such a just having a lot of fun and laughing their asses off to dead serious  Yeah  Yeah  That's just brilliant acting, man  Start the engines over  Yeah  Yeah  No, no channel line-up had been sent  Sent  Yes  Yes  No production had been sent  Yes  Oof  Yeah  Yeah  Something else  We lost the Chris Kelly, Chris Cross or something else 
[03:01:30]  Oh, the Tony Saragossa Depends commercial.  Dude, this is so embarrassing.  But it really is.  So embarrassing.  They're trying to make it cool to fucking what?  I guess they're trying to make it like, look, if you're a man and you're pissing yourself a little bit, don't worry about it.  You could still be a man because Tony says so.  Right.  And the whole commercial is based on this man cave kind of, hey, look at us. 
[03:02:00]  We're still men, but I wear a little dighty.  Right.  I wear a little Kotex in my undies to sop up my pissy pants.  That's so silly.  Yeah.  But the commercial is uncomfortably douchey.  Because they try to make it like you're more of a man if you wear these.  Right.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Like I'm going to buy a box just to fucking be a man.  Aren't you more of a man if you don't give a fuck that's just dripping into your underpants?  That's a real man.  Here's what a real man does.  He gets his wife in there.  He says, lock your lips around that. 
[03:02:30]  I feel some tinkle coming.  That's a man.  I'm playing cards with the boys.  Lock your lips around this.  Sock up some tinkle.  A real man takes his soap stain fucking underwear and gives it to his wife to wash it.  Yeah.  To wash it out.  Go hit this on a rock.  Now wash it.  Yeah.  Go down to the river and wash out my fucking yellow stains.  So I guess it's Poise.  Is that what it is?  That's the product name.  Isn't it?  Poise.  And it's not a diaper, but it's like this cup looking pad that goes in your undies right 
[03:03:00]  where your cock is.  So if you have a little leakage, a little drippage, you're all right.  Let's see the commercial there, Samuel.  I'm Tony Siragusa and I've been around the toughest guys in football.  Now I'm training guys who leak a little to guard their manhood with man style protection  of new depend shields and guards.  Who are you?  My house.  Perfect.  Come on me.  Build you a little man space under here.  Man space.  Oh, could you pause for that?  It's pens, shields, and guards.  He opens up the cabinet under the bathroom sink where he said, I built you a little man 
[03:03:30]  space.  Right.  And now inside is a dartboard, a football table, poker chip.  It's a mini man cave.  An air hockey game.  Yeah.  It's a little miniature man cave where he stores his depend pissy pads.  Wouldn't your wife make fun of your pissy pads?  Of course she would not.  She would not look at that and be proud and think fondly of it.  Where'd she go?  My parents are coming over.  Can you hide your pissy pads?  Hide your pissy pads. 
[03:04:00]  And she'd think back when you.  Can you put them in a basement in a box somewhere?  When you first got together and you didn't piss yourself.  Right.  It's just.  No, pissy pads are not cool.  No.  So, look, there's a bowl of chips and some peanuts in there and it's just a little man  cave that he built to store his pissy pads.  Pissy pads.  Let's see the rest here.  Sweet.  See, the pen shields and guards are made to fit guys.  That's awesome.  Oh, my God.  I trained that guy.  Now it's your turn.  Go online for my tips to help guard your manhood with new depend shields and guards. 
[03:04:30]  Shields, guards, manhood.  They're trying to make it seem like.  And he's over the top of his delivery.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey.  He probably initially went like, hey.  And they're like, no, no, Tony.  Tony.  You've got to, like, really over the top man this up.  This isn't about, like, a Kotex or a fucking Modest pad.  This is cool.  This is for men.  This is something that you don't have to be ashamed of.  You're protecting your manhood.  You weren't guarding and shielding. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, you're fucking done.  Get a hold of yourself.  You're done.  It's like those fucking, is it the Viagra commercials or the CLs?  I think Viagra ones.  Where it's.  And he's solving every problem except his rod.  Right.  He's like, oh, his lighter broke.  And he pulls out a pocket knife and some flint.  Right.  And then he fucking bashes it together and lights a fire.  Well, you know what that means?  Yeah.  Okay.  The flint.  You're supposed to be bashing your hard. 
[03:05:30]  Your hard on with it.  Your turgid cock.  It just makes it.  It just makes it.  It makes him feel bad.  But they can't show that on network television, so.  Yeah.  And then his car's overheating and he's fucking pouring the bottled water he bought from the  gas station into it.  And he's back on the road again.  He's always alone and solving all kinds of problems except for that limp fucking dick  in his pants.  I like the one where the couple runs out of the rain.  Into the rain.  I think that's the Cialis one, right?  Well, that symbolizes fucking jizz flying everywhere.  Jizz is all over the place. 
[03:06:00]  But they can't show jizz flying everywhere on network TV, so let's have them just run out  into the rain and let the viewer figure it out.  It's rain.  And then they got the couple that's sitting in the separate bathtubs holding hands.  Right.  I don't know what that's supposed to fucking represent.  That represents you got to cool off your shit because you're having so much sex.  With your big fucking turgid rod.  You got to fucking cool that shit off after you're done with it.  You got to let it calm down.  Right.  I didn't think of that.  Yes.  Yeah.  Bubble bath will cure all that.  Get in the tub.  Yes.  Pull that rod off. 
[03:06:30]  Do they forget he forgot about taping his ass together?  Yeah, Steven Montana.  That's right.  Sarah Goose has told a story where he taped his ass together to keep the shit in.  Oh, why don't you just wrap some tape around your cock if you're leaking?  A little duct tape.  Yes.  This is for men.  For men.  Yeah.  Protect your manhood.  Depends.  And it's like green.  The packaging is green like a football field.  Yeah.  Looks like a men's deodorant package. 
[03:07:00]  Right.  It does.  I hope he got paid a lot of money.  Oh, man.  For that.  That's like the one with fucking the diaper one.  The full diaper one.  With, um...  Who was that chick that was doing that?  She's on the dress on the red.  Oh, Lisa Renna.  Yeah, Lisa Renna.  Trying to make that cool.  Yeah, look.  And her husband's like...  Don't be husband of hers.  Like, yeah, no, it really is.  Is it cool?  She turns around with the diaper on, but she's got a dress on, and he's kind of looking at  the camera like, yeah.  What do you guys think?  No, not yet.  She's wearing a diety. 
[03:07:30]  What I'm thinking is that her uterus is falling out.  Right.  That's what I'm thinking.  I think she's pissing and shitting herself.  Right.  Just because a woman pisses all over herself doesn't mean she can't be sexy at the same  time.  Absolutely.  Well, to me, if she doesn't, she can't be sexy.  I hate those damn diapers.  There must be something about voluntary urination and involuntary, though, Jimmy, that kind of makes  it hot.  No.  No?  You don't care when and where it's coming out?  At the mall?  Oh, there is one other thing.  Oh.  The Redskins.  Ah.  To the Red Tails, I think, and are changing it. 
[03:08:00]  The politicians want the Redskins to change their name to the Red Tails.  Well, the politicians, I mean, they can't legislate it.  They can ask for it, but I don't know if I like Red Tails.  I understand the whole history behind the name of the Redskins and all, but I just hope  they hang in there and say fuck you to the special interest groups and everybody else  and keep the name.  Aren't Red Tails the fucking black fighter squadron from World War II?  Yeah.  Well, aren't they going to get all pissy about it?  But, I mean, it sounds kind of, I understand what it represents, but it still sounds, Red 
[03:08:30]  Tails is kind of a wimpy name.  It is.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I just hope they hang in there.  I like the squaws.  I like...  That wouldn't do much good.  No, that wouldn't do much good.  To go from the Redskins to the squaws.  The Washington Squaws.  They're going to have to change the name.  The Washington Savage Injins.  And you spell it like I-N-J-U-N-S.  Yeah.  Injins.  That'd be cool.  I'd wear that jersey.  Yeah.  Why not?  Why not?  That would be good.  Why not?  Why not? 
[03:09:00]  Well, dear, the commentators.  How did your team name die?  And those three dopes up in Boston, we didn't talk about them.  What the fuck?  How stupid can you be?  Oh, pretty stupid.  Yeah, they got arrested for...  Well, they were aiding.  Aiding the terrorists by getting rid of some evidence.  They were the ones that got rid of the laptop, too, that they've been searching for.  What fucking scumbags?  Did they find the laptop?  I don't know.  Are they yapping?  Oh, they're yapping. 
[03:09:30]  They're scared shitless.  They're yapping.  They could get up to five years in jail, right?  That's all?  That's it?  For aiding murderers?  Really?  I believe that's about all they could get is five years.  Fuckwads?  Helping your friend after you know he was the guy.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  What's going on with the youth of America?  More of...  They were misled.  No consequences.  I'm sure they were misled, and they thought they were doing a friend a favor.  They didn't think it was that important.  Oh, my God.  See, this is exactly what I know about to happen.  We were in a discussion about this not happening, actually. 
[03:10:00]  No, because I really do have to leave.  Yeah, there was a discussion about this.  I don't know why.  But now it's awkward.  He's not supposed to see the awkwardness of the whole thing.  Is he here?  Yeah.  I was waiting at my house.  Well, we got to just jump into it.  We can't make him wait.  Oh, my God.  He's Sir Ben Kingsley.  Sir Ben Kingsley is outside our studio.  Now I got to walk over there, and you guys got to leave in front of him.  Well, we're all supposed to cut him off at the past, so it doesn't look awkward.  That's all.  Yes.  Take him to a green room, but we don't have one. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, my goodness.  Well, we got Penn Kingsley coming in.  Yes, yes, sir.  We got to call him Sir Ben, yeah.  Sir Ben.  You got to call him that?  Yeah, it's respect him.  Really?  Yeah.  Really?  Can I look him in the eyes?  Yes.  When I walk past, oh, my God, I got to pack this up so it doesn't look like I'm packing  up.  I'm packing up.  Oh, my God, Sir Ben.  Sir Ben was on the Sopranos, if you remember.  Yes, he was.  Yeah, there was a...  How are we going to do this?  I don't want him to look...  All right, Sam, just run over there quickly.  I don't want it to look awkward.  Oh, my God.  It's going to look awkward.  I don't do have to get home to a sick kid. 
[03:11:00]  It's going to look awkward.  Yeah.  We set this up ahead of time.  Do you have the card, too, Sam?  Oh, yeah.  Hang on.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Hang on.  Oh, God.  What do you want to pay it on?  I'll be listening.  You should be listening.  I'm just going to make believe I'm an intern walking down the studio.  All right, Ben Kingsley's up next.  Is that right now?  Yeah.  Hello, lovely to see you.  Oh, God. 
[03:11:30]  He says I can't read memory, but...  Worst thing ever.  Well, we told Roland not to do it this way.  Why can't I read the memory card?  I'm going to walk out this way, backwards.  Do we not have a video element now?  I think, yeah.  Do you want it right here?  The video camera's not working.  Okay.  It's not working?  No.  Hang on one sec.  You have no idea why it's not working.  Oh, wait, wait.  How about I know? 
[03:12:00]  Let me try one thing.  Talk amongst yourselves.  Just get our card.  Let's just do it.  Can your camera take video?  No, we're good to go.  Okay, bring me.  Yes.  Yep, ma'am.  Hello.  We are hanging on.  Very well, very well.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Welcome.  Sir Ben Kingsley.  Yes, it's you.  Hello.  Thank you.  How are you?  A pleasure.  Lovely to see you.  I like wearing cans. 
[03:12:30]  Is that okay?  Oh, yeah.  We prefer it.  Please do.  We're on the air.  A lot of guests don't like to wear them, so we just kind of leave them there as an option.  When you became, I wanted to ask you too, becoming Sir Ben, what is the process for that happening?  Is it something they tell you is going to happen and then it happens years later?  I had a letter from the Prime Minister's office, maybe a month before it happened, and then  invited to the palace for the actual ceremony.  Had you known before that they were like, like, do you know what it is that they say, 
[03:13:00]  okay, well, we would like to make Ben Kingsley Sir Ben Kingsley?  Like, what happens before that?  You don't have any idea.  Oh, no.  It's a total surprise.  And in Britain, that's a tremendous honor.  It is indeed, yeah.  Yeah.  It's, um, mine, my citation was for my, um, contribution to, or my, my work in drama.  So, um, it was for, for a dramatic actor.  Right.  But it's not something you can, like, work towards.  Like, you can't have that be a goal, necessarily.  You have no idea, you know, if you just hit the, the national nerve somehow, or the national 
[03:13:30]  psyche, then England, which is not very openly enthusiastic like the States.  Right.  It's quite guarded.  Mm-hmm.  So, the, the counterbalance of that rather guarded, um, aspect to your work is balanced  by, you know, the Prime Minister and the palace saying, we've seen you.  We like what you do very much, which is great.  Once you're recognized that way, does that change the way you work? 
[03:14:00]  Does that change the way you just pick what projects you're going to do?  Are you, I have, I have always, um, picked my projects based on my opening years in the  theater.  So, I love good writing.  I always pick good, right.  I hope to always pick good writing.  So, um, that, that national embrace doesn't really affect my process in, in as much as it's  always been rooted in another, uh, a great Englishman called Shakespeare.  I'm not pretending to be a great Englishman, but, but that was my starting point. 
[03:14:30]  His work's so beautiful.  So, is that considered, and again, forgive my ignorance, is that considered being knighted  or no?  Is that, being a sir is different than being knighted or it's?  No, it's the same thing.  Oh, it is the same thing.  Okay.  I was going to say congratulations on being knighted, but I figured it would be wrong  and I would look stupid.  Absolutely right.  Yeah.  You've been in some of my favorite films.  Um, I mean, I think one that people, like everybody knows Schindler's List, but a lot  of people don't talk about, uh, searching for Bobby Fischer, which is just, it's one of  my, it's probably my top 10 or 12 favorite movies.  Uh, that's very interesting because, um, Josh, with whom I was this morning, uh, said that's 
[03:15:00]  one of his favorite films.  Josh Wayskin?  Yes.  You saw the, you saw the real Josh Wayskin?  No, I'm sorry.  My, my, my interviewer this morning on, on, on, uh, on a, on a morning show, uh, said  that as, as his child gets older, he's going to show his child a film because he said it's  the greatest sports film he'd ever seen.  And that, that final battle between those two kids is extraordinary.  Yeah.  And it's, it's hard to make, cause I love chess. 
[03:15:30]  Uh, it's really hard to make chess dramatic.  It's hard to build up drama.  I mean, you know, Bobby Fischer pulled it off, but it's really hard to make a  movie where the, where the climax is a chess match between two children.  Well, you, you mentioned the link.  The link is that Stephen Zalian, who wrote and directed Searching for Bobby Fischer, went  on to write Schindler's List.  So, you know, that brings us back to writing.  And then when, when it's beautifully written on the page, it's, it's a joy to act and a joy 
[03:16:00]  to bring to life.  When you, cause I find acting to be so difficult.  When you see a role, it's, they, they send you the script for Bobby Fischer.  And now do you say, uh, I'm going to learn these lines before I do them, or do you kind  of like to just see them once?  Like I said, Brando would have like, you know, cue cards all over the place, or do you like  to be completely off book and completely memorized?  I love to be completely off book because then you, you have some understanding of the sweep  of the whole movie.  You have some understanding of, of the shading of every scene where it sits in the film. 
[03:16:30]  Cause we don't always film in sequences, you know?  So I love to learn the whole thing.  And, uh, do you, I would assume you must get very close to these characters that you play,  uh, since you, since you do them so well, how long do they stay with you after?  Like, so, you know, like, when does Gandhi leave you?  Well, I'm, one of my tricks is to let go immediately.  The director says cut to let go totally so that the next time I do a take, it's a running 
[03:17:00]  jump again.  I never liked to be, I never liked to have the elastic halfway stretched, right?  It goes right back to its original shape.  And then on action again, I, it's the same process.  I go from almost from zero into the character.  So you're not one of these guys who's sitting there at lunch, still in character.  No, absolutely not.  No, I'm not.  I, I get back, I get back to me as often as I possibly can and as frequently as I can.  Then I hope that the result is that maybe the take is fresh every time rather than I'll 
[03:17:30]  give you a copy of a copy of a copy, which is a bit downhill.  Everyone, everyone works differently, but I'm not, uh, I don't quite know what the word  method actor means, but I'm not one anyway.  I'm sure you've worked with some though over the years.  And is it, is it odd to talk to a guy off, off, uh, well, you know, a cut and then again,  you're having, you know, you're having a burger together and he's talking in characters.  Christian Bale just remains Batman while he's on set.  And it's like, right.  Uh, well, as I say, you know, and I respect his work enormously that everyone has their own, 
[03:18:00]  uh, their own method of working.  Uh, I do remember one method actor who shall remain nameless.  And, um, he was so keen on being in character before a scene, um, banging around and kicking  furniture and yelling that by the time he got on set, he was exhausted.  And by the time the director said action, he'd forgotten all his lines.  Because he was so wrapped up in the character while we weren't filming, which doesn't matter.  No, it doesn't matter.  Was his performance good or, or did it suffer like in, in the final product? 
[03:18:30]  Like, cause Brando, like, you know, I've heard he would read dialogue while people,  he would have a tape to their face, which you're like, that's horrible.  But because it played the way Brando did it, you're like, wow, what a brilliant move.  Oh, he was, I mean, his performances are absolutely magnificent.  Beautiful.  Yeah.  So whatever he did is okay.  Although you could see where it would be degrading to his co-star who had to sit there  like a prop with lines taped to his forehead.  Yeah, it's a little embarrassing.  Isn't there a party game where you stick a word to your head that you don't know what 
[03:19:00]  it is and you've got to guess the word that's stuck off to your head?  Yeah.  Yeah, that sounds like, that's what I heard he would do to certain, uh, certain guys  who could get away with it.  So I guess it all depends on how the final product comes out, whether somebody was a  genius or whether they were just kind of irritating and eccentric.  Right.  Of course, of course.  And Brando was a genius.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  So Iron Man 3 is what you're promoting.  It comes out on Friday.  Yeah.  Is when you go into a summer blockbuster movie, you know, going in, this is what the  goal is.  Is that very different from, uh, something like Bobby Fisher? 
[03:19:30]  Not with this particular franchise, because what's, what's so beautiful and contagious  about this franchise and what everybody loves about it is that although of course it's called  Iron Man and it's about massively powerful exteriors.  what they do explore is the vulnerable man inside.  And that's where Robert Downey Jr.  is terrific.  He's vulnerable to friendship.  He's vulnerable to comradeship.  He's vulnerable to loss.  He's vulnerable to self-doubt.  He's vulnerable to panic attacks.  He's vulnerable to love because he's in an intimate relationship with Pepper, who's 
[03:20:00]  magnificently played.  So, uh, I think that that sets, that style sets it in a, in a genre almost of its own.  Therefore brings me back to the writing.  I just, I'm, I jump in just on the same level.  Is that more difficult to kind of humanize a character that's obviously, it could be so  silly, like it's a superhero, but you have to relate it to an audience that's like, okay,  I believe this.  I think it's, I think it's a bit of a tight rope. 
[03:20:30]  I think that it's all a question of taste and rhythm and how you construct the arc of  the character.  Uh, I think the way, uh, the way those moments offered to the camera and the way it's edited,  I think the rhythm of these films is beautiful because after every magnificent action sequence  that you have, it's immediately followed by a moment of vulnerability or tenderness or  absurdity.  But there's always that wonderful rhythm where they pull you, they pull the audience  in with magnificent action and then they, there's something beautiful happens. 
[03:21:00]  Something very human happens.  It's very clever rhythm.  And did you want to see the script before you agreed to, to, to do the film or the writing  is so important to you?  I was visited by Kevin Feige before I had the script and taught me through the arc of the  character in the film, which I, I loved what he had to say.  And then they sent me a script and then Shane Black welcomed me onto the set.  And I, I felt like a team player within seconds. 
[03:21:30]  They're a very, very welcoming group of people to work with.  And what do you want?  Is this the type of movie that you would watch?  What do you watch for your own entertainment?  I have watched all of this particular franchise, the, the, the Marvel franchise.  And I absolutely love it.  You started to, just to jump back in your career a bit, because it's very interesting.  I read that, uh, Brian Epstein, uh, you know, the Beatles manager, uh, is kind of how you,  how you got started.  And, uh, can you just talk about that for a second?  Cause you don't hear many, many people with Beatles connections. 
[03:22:00]  I, I was in a show, uh, a play on stage in London that was produced by Brian Epstein.  He backed it.  He put the money into it.  He was the producer.  And my role in this play was a kind of musical chorus.  I would come on during the play and sing a song about what the hero was going through and what he was about to go through.  It was a lovely device that, that kept the play running smoothly.  And Brian, of course, on the opening night, got two of his mates in, Ringo Starr and John Lennon. 
[03:22:30]  And, um, uh, I met them after the show.  Are those guys actors?  I've not heard of them.  I, I, I met them after the show and they were very sweet about my music.  Um, and it was, you know, a total ripoff of their songs and Bob Dylan's, a total ripoff.  Um, just sang with an English accent there.  So, you know, I got away with it.  And I then I met Dick James, who was the recording manager of, of the, of the, of the Fab Four at the time. 
[03:23:00]  And he, indeed, to my astonishment, offered me a recording contract and said that he would like to mold me.  Mold, I would like to mold you.  He said, I'm going to mold you, make you a rock star.  And I ran out of his office and became an actor.  Do you ever look back on that and say, wow, maybe I could have given that a shot?  You know what?  If I do have a musical ear, and I think I do, it's so much now absorbed into the tone I use as an actor. 
[03:23:30]  The rhythm of the language I use as an act.  Sexy Beast is a kind of musical performance because it's entirely based on rhythm and tone.  And so I do use my musical ear in, in my, in my acting.  So I don't really have any regrets.  I probably would be, you know, dead in a pool of drugs, blood, and alcohol had I become a rock star.  Yeah, you had to do something much more stable, like acting.  Yeah, it's much more stable.  Well, they're telling us in our ear that you have to leave because you have promotion. 
[03:24:00]  But you've already won a Grammy.  You've won an Oscar.  I mean, it's not like you haven't done a tremendous amount.  And, you know, Iron Man 3 opens tomorrow, May 3rd, all over the place.  And Sir Ben Kingsley, thank you.  It was tremendous to have you here.  Great pleasure.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  You guys missed it.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live, and on his way out, Sir Ben Kingsley actually knighted me. 
[03:24:30]  Which I didn't know knights could then, once you knight somebody, you can actually knight somebody else.  And he said, Sam, you and Jim did such a great job.  Jim is gone.  However, I would like to knight you, Sir Sam Roberts.  So, congratulations to me.  That's a big thrill to have somebody like that knight me.  But, you know, and it reminds me, too, to stay humble through my new knight dump.  He did. 
[03:25:00]  Ben Kingsley came in here, and he was a professional.  He was a wonderful man.  And I feel like that's how I'm going to maintain my composure for the rest of this.  Did you see that go down, Eric?  Eric, I saw and heard the interview, yeah.  Not your knighting, though.  You didn't see that?  No, because only the Queen can do that.  No, no, no.  Knights can re-knight.  Once you're knighted, you can then go and knight someone.  I don't believe that to be true.  All right.  Well, we'll have to take it up with Sir Ben, then.  Is he still around?  He's over in Al-Q right now.  You know who is going to be here today? 
[03:25:30]  Wait till you hear this.  I don't know if you know about this.  Sal, wait till you hear this.  Wait till Troy hears about this.  Who's this?  You know who's going to be in this building today?  Not on this show, but in this building.  Oh, boy.  The fuckery continues.  Carly Rae Jepsen?  Carly Rae Jepsen is here today.  Today.  Not here, though.  Not here.  Why?  I don't know.  I mean, I thought that our history with her was very well... 
[03:26:00]  You lost her career.  I thought that was made clear to everybody.  I thought it was very well documented.  You know, but apparently not.  Because Carly Rae Jepsen's coming in.  I think she's going to be here.  And it's all over.  If you check, like, Twitter and stuff, she's taking over Hits1 Twitter account and everything.  She's doing a whole bunch of stuff.  You're going to get her for your Sunday show?  No.  What the?  Did they ask you?  No.  No, they didn't ask me, Eric.  Conspiracy. 
[03:26:30]  Conspiracy, I think.  They don't mention the channel numbers.  They don't get you Carly Rae Jepsen.  That's all about me, isn't it?  Something's going on.  302.  Sam Roberts, professional broadcaster.  What's up, buddy?  Well, I got some burning questions I think the audience wants to know.  Are you making the channel jump also?  Meaning once O&A move to channel 103, will Sam Roberts be with them?  Yes.  It remains to be seen. 
[03:27:00]  Contracts are being worked on right now, but we'll see how it goes.  You know, I'm optimistic, but we'll see how it goes.  You can never tell with these things.  I understand.  And, hey, if you decide to make the jump with them, I really appreciate you reaching out to help guys out.  All right.  I got another question, too.  Are you going to have a live show on Mom's Day, or are you going to honor your mother on that day?  When's Mother's Day?  I thought it was the 12th of May.  Right.  Well, I mean, it is coming up.  What are you going to do, Larry?  Maybe I'm going to be hauling spray like I do every day. 
[03:27:30]  What about you, Alan?  What are you planning on doing for Mother's Day?  When's Mother's Day?  We were just talking about it.  It's in like a week or two.  Well, I'll call my mom.  I hope you're not planning on giving her another lame card that you picked up from a gas station.  Was that your plan?  Don't do it.  Okay.  What, are you going to take her out for the same old dinner?  Well.  Don't do it.  No.  So what are you going to do?  Take our advice.  What do you got, Sam?  Head to my guy, Steven Singer.

Congratulations, sir, Sam Roberts.  Thank you very much, Vince.  So now that you're a knight, does that mean that you can make a E-Rock Sir Slabo?  E-Rock, is that something you'd like to be? Would you like to be Sir Slabo?  I would like to be knighted, but you don't have that authority. 
[03:29:30]  That's not true, because technically I was knighted.  Lady Trucker.  Sir Sam, now that you are knighted, will you be getting yourself a suit of armor?  I will look into that.  Alan, if you could look into seeing if Steven Singer can make me a suit of armor out of Argentium.  Oh, yeah, sure.  Can you look into that for me?  I'll get a hold of him.  That would be great. Thank you, Lady Trucker.  Snowy in Michigan.  Hey, Sam. How are you doing?  Good. How are you, Snowy?  I'm okay.  First, before I get to my point about the knighting thing, 
[03:30:00]  I was kind of hoping Steven Lynch would play the D&D song in honor of your intern there,  who actually plays D&D still.  That's true. He does. That's Alan Thicke, Jr.  Yep.  Yep.  I did forget his name.  On the knighthood thing, I remember the men in the movie Kingdom of Heaven,  the main character Bloom plays knights a bunch of regular people to help fight the citizens  in the end of that movie Kingdom of Heaven.  Right. Well, I mean, I don't know about the movie Kingdom of Heaven,  but I do know at the end of Clue, the guy at the door says the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand. 
[03:30:30]  Well, stay humble, Sam.  I know what I was going to do to do.  I mean, not just a self-promoter or anything like that.  Thank you, Snowy. Thank you very much.  Bye, everyone.  Goodbye.  Was that before Shake, Rattle, and Roll kicked in?  That was right before.  Right before Mr. Green says,  I'm going to go home and sleep with my wife.  And as a kid, I sat there looking at him like,  who the fuck else is he going to sleep with?  Like, that was one of those lines that I had no idea what he was talking about.  Like, that's the closing line of the movie. 
[03:31:00]  Because earlier in the film, he had said,  they were talking about their secrets.  It's Michael McKeon, right, playing Mr. Green, isn't that right?  Yeah.  And he says, I'm a homosexual.  And he's talking, first of all, don't take that out of context.  And second of all, he's a government employee,  and at that time it was very bad and stuff, and he couldn't be.  And so then at the end, he says,  I'm going to go home and sleep with my wife.  Meaning everything comes full circle.  It wasn't true.  When I first saw the movie, I didn't know what homosexual meant.  I was a kid.  And so he goes home and he says, I'm going to go sleep with my wife. 
[03:31:30]  And I go, who, yeah, who else would he sleep with?  Men go home and sleep with their wives.  Do you remember when you learned what gay was?  Let me think.  I don't think so.  I don't know specifically if I remember what gay was.  Right.  I remember my uncle used to say, this isn't gay, this isn't gay,  and don't tell anyone about it.  But beyond that, I don't remember specifically.  Do you remember Alan Thicke, Jr.?  I think it was a queer eye for the straight guy. 
[03:32:00]  It was Carson Kressley?  Yeah.  Because I was like, what's a queer?  And then my brother had to explain it to me.  It's a great question.  You asked your brother, what's a queer?  Right.  Yeah.  And he was like, well, a queer is a gay.  And you said, what's a gay?  Right.  And he explained when guys fuck each other in the butt.  Yeah.  It was really weird.  Yeah.  I would imagine.  That's not the definition you were looking for.  Steve in Michigan.  Sir, Sam Roberts.  How are you, Steve?  Good.  One of the attributes of a knight as opposed to possess is being charitable.  Right.  So as your first official charitable act of the knight, 
[03:32:30]  can you hook somebody up with a Steven Singer rose?  No, but I can give you Opie's unfinished Sudoku puzzle today.  He barely did any of it.  That would be great.  He didn't sign it either, but I'll still send it to you.  Well, maybe you could sign it.  Okay.  I'll sign it.  That's very charitable of me.  And I will sign it, Sir Sam Roberts.  Stay on hold, Steve.  Remind me to sign this, Alan.  Here, you take this.  You remind me.  Because I'm not going to do it on the air.  That wouldn't be professional.  Marshall in Texas. 
[03:33:00]  Hey, Sir Shipster.  Yes.  I'll accept that.  I love how when you started the bit, you were like, hey, Eric, you saw that, right?  You were like, oh, no, I didn't see that happen.  What the fuck?  Slavo, what the fuck?  No shit, asshole.  Eric knows the first rule of improv is to always say no.  I do not believe that to be true.  I think you are lying.  Let's go to Jim in New York. 
[03:33:30]  Hey, Sir Sam.  How are you?  Fine.  With your new power, is it possible you could make Eric the Earl of many sandwiches?  Eric, would you prefer being Sir Slavo or the Earl of a huge amount of sandwiches on any given day?  The Earl title is tempting.  You like that?  Because one thing you like is being in a royal family.  The other thing you love is what?  Sandwiches.  That's exactly right.  I like how I say it.  I know.  I love it.  That's why I never say it. 
[03:34:00]  John in Texas.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  A couple things, sir.  Sir Sam.  Yeah.  Now that you're a knight, are you going to go and get a big boy TV?  I don't know.  Do you think 32-inch TV is too small for a knight?  Well, I mean.  You know, man.  You've got to get a wall going over there.  But then they also owe you, like, land.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Maybe some virgins, too.  Is that, did knights get virgins, or is that something else?  No, that's a different religion.  If you were a king, you could just go and take somebody's wife on the first night if you really wanted to.  See, the closest I've ever been being. 
[03:34:30]  I'm almost a king, but only in, like, the King Ralph way.  Like, if the whole royal family got wiped out.  From the family photo in Lightning?  Right.  Then they would come to me and say, well, Ben Kingsley did knight you.  And everybody, even the fake knights, got wiped out.  So, Sam?  And I'd be like, yes.  You can call me King Sam.  They'd just show up here while you're doing the show.  You had no idea you were even related to anybody.  Exactly.  Exactly.  And then I'd, you know, drive to Buckingham Palace in a limo and just stick my fat ass out the top of it.  It'd be great. 
[03:35:00]  Like a bowling alley?  Yeah.  It'd be awesome.  Ben?  Hey, sir, Sam.  Hey, do you remember when Sir Roger Moore was there as well?  He was the king, knight, Templer, or whatever it was.  So, I wonder how his reaction would have been to Ben Kingsley being in the same room.  Or how do you figure those discussions would be?  Like, hey, go get me something and drink, Ben?  I'm going to tell you this.  I mean, maybe Roger Moore thinks he has something over Ben Kingsley, but the fact is that Ben Kingsley is doing the smart thing, and he's knighting people around him. 
[03:35:30]  He's creating his own little knight army.  If the shit goes down between Roger Moore and Ben Kingsley, guess which side I'm going to take?  So, you're part of a Ben Kingsley pyramid scam?  100%.  All right, Sam.  Have a good one.  I'll talk to you later.  Jim in Alabama.  Hey, sir, Sam.  I just want to congratulate you on this historic day.  Thank you.  Being the first Black Knight, could you make an order to have Sal executed? 
[03:36:00]  I will.  Actually, I will see if I can get that done.  Earl of many sandwiches, Iraq.  Yes, sir.  Can we see if we can get Sal executed?  That's an order that has to come, I think, down from you.  Okay, well, then I will order it.  I don't know if I have that power, actually.  It shall be done.  I think Ben Kingsley, who knighted me, would have to order Sal's execution.  And he was close.  And he barely even interacted with him.  Well, if you have to get your orders from Ben Kingsley, can't you just knight someone and have them do it for you? 
[03:36:30]  Yeah, but I'm not going to knight you, I don't think.  I know where you're going with that.  And I don't think you deserve to be knighted just yet.  Chris.  All hells are slobbing!  Okay, he just wanted to yell slobo that time.  And, Eric, to be fair, I told them if they want to yell slobo, don't try to prank call.  Just say what you want, and I'll let you through.  Yeah, that doesn't make it any better.  Oh. 
[03:37:00]  C.W. in New York has a great question for Iraq.  Yes.  How are you doing, Sam?  Great.  How are you doing, C.W.?  Good, good.  I'd like to know if Iraq is the Burger King.  Iraq, if you were a king, would you consider yourself the Burger King?  Why not?  Mongo.  You have to say my name right, Sam.  It's Sam Mongo.  Oh, oh.  You're right, Mongo.  Yeah.  Go on.  Now when Jeff says goodnight, you say, no, I'm a great knight. 
[03:37:30]  Oh, God.  All right.  I'm going to hang up on you, Mongo.  This is why I don't go to your calls and try to pronounce your name right or any of that.  Steve in New York.  Hey, what's up, Sammy?  How are you, Steve?  Hey, now, if you're going to be a knight now, you're going to have to take an act of celibacy,  much like Fezzy from the Ron and Fez show.  All right.  Well, then I promise I will not sleep with any women because I'll be up all night.  Don't step on me, Steve.  Maybe with your new connections, you can get them laid with one of those young boys. 
[03:38:00]  I don't know why it's got to go back to Fez.  Fez has nothing to do with...  Fez is not a knight, is he?  Do you know Fez to be a knight, Alan Thicke, Jr.?  No.  I don't think he is.  I don't know why it has to go back to Fez.  He was just in here.  Is he a knight?  No, he's not a knight.  Okay.  I didn't think...  Did he have a suit of armor?  Did he come in on a horse?  No.  Save a princess?  Nope.  Fight a dragon?  Nope.  Friends with a king?  No, I don't think so.  Friends with a Kingsley?  No, I don't think so.  All right.  Well, then he's not a knight.  What are you going to do? 
[03:38:30]  I don't know if you've been hearing about what's been going on behind the scenes, Eric.  You're the intern boss, correct?  Yeah.  Well, Troy told me that he and Alan Thicke, Jr. had it out yesterday.  He came into my office yesterday and said,  today was a bad day for Alan Thicke, Jr.  Today or yesterday?  He said this to me yesterday.  Oh, yesterday.  Okay.  Did you hear about this?  I think I did.  Yeah, I wasn't around for it, but I think I heard about this.  Well, you guys remember, everybody met Alan Thicke, Jr. on the big show earlier this week. 
[03:39:00]  What day was it, Alan?  Oh, I think that might have been Wednesday.  Let's go with Wednesday, then.  That would be yesterday.  Wait, was it?  Oh, so then Tuesday.  Then we'll go Tuesday, then.  We'll go Tuesday.  Sorry.  So, he was on the show Tuesday, and Troy came in and said his work had not been exemplary.  He also made a point to mention that you were not showered, greasy hair, an aroma.  That's the day you pitched Asshole of the Week box, correct?  Correct, yeah.  How's that? 
[03:39:30]  That was last week.  Oh, you know what?  That was Friday.  Okay, Friday.  How's that going, by the way?  The Asshole of the Week box?  Yeah.  Any votes this week so far?  Well, no.  To be fair, I kind of hid the box back in your office just because I kind of figured no  one was really that into it.  Well, not with that attitude, they're not.  Yeah, you're right.  Do you want it to happen tomorrow?  I would love it.  Well, you've got to put that box out front and center and see who people vote for you,  then, don't you?  Yeah, sure.  All right, let's do it and make it happen for tomorrow.  Okay.  So, even after everything that happened on the air, on Friday, yesterday, Troy did not 
[03:40:00]  give you an easy time, huh?  No.  What happened?  Because I remember the argument was that Troy was looking for some kind of phone calls for  production and he had given you ideas.  He just wanted audio clips of people making phone calls to radio stations.  And he was saying movies like talk radio, movies like airheads.  Is that right, Troy?  Yep.  And you were having a lot of difficulty with this task. 
[03:40:30]  Yes.  Yeah.  It doesn't seem like the most complicated task in the world.  Well, okay.  So, I wasn't really, it didn't really click to me until yesterday's blowout that what Troy  really wanted was, I mean, after he gave me some examples of like, of Jerry Seinfeld  going like, hello, you, you idiot, or something like that, that's, that's, do you have a clip  of Jerry Seinfeld picking up a phone and saying, hello, you idiot?  No, I have, in one of the production pieces, Jerry Seinfeld says something, he says, hello, 
[03:41:00]  he says, you know, something like that.  Yeah, something like that.  But I, I just don't remember the episode.  Yeah, I don't, I don't remember the exact clip.  But, basically, I told him, like, look, I need phone calls, something that can relate  to production for calling into the show.  Right.  Whatever.  So, Jerry Seinfeld is going, hello, like, boom, we find a spot for that.  That's like one of those things where, you know, you say, call, the Opie and Anthony  show, pew, pew, pew, hello, you got it.  Right.  Or then I have a clip from the Jerky Boys where they says, he said, get Tony on the phone. 
[03:41:30]  You know, it kind of relates to.  Tony, Anthony, he says it in a funny way.  Right.  And it's recognizable, you recognize it's the Jerky Boys.  Sure.  Or Frank Rizzo.  Right.  It's just, it's just, it's just, help make the production piece sparkle a little bit  brighter.  Right.  So, what I did was.  And you wanted Alan to give you that sparkle.  Well, because Alan comes to me, he comes knocking on my door, he's like, hey, man, do  you have anything I could do?  I said, well, yes, I do have something you can do.  When he knocks on your door, are those fingers crossed saying, say no, say no, say  no, say no, say no.  No, absolutely not. 
[03:42:00]  Probably.  You think yes, Alan, you're saying no.  I'm saying no.  Okay.  But you're, Troy, you would assume probably yes.  Right.  Okay.  So, you know, I told him what I needed.  And as we discussed on the show last week, he gives me like a disc of, and I gave it  to you, there was 12.  And he was arguing about how many there were on the show.  There was 12.  I counted them.  Was that, is that an incorrect count?  Well, I mean, there were 12 on that disc.  On that first disc.  And they were, and 10 of them were from Entourage.  It's a good show.  Okay.  None of which, even remotely, could relate to what was going on. 
[03:42:30]  There was one call.  Well, there was a whole bunch of clips like, hey, get Ari on the phone.  Yeah.  Then there was, uh, there was one call from Snoop Dogg where he said something about, he's  like, uh, something about, there was a prank phone call he did where he's like, D's nuts  or something.  Okay.  That's good.  Not the one from the album.  It was something else.  I was like, oh, that's okay.  Well, that's always fun.  Cause you go up to somebody and you say like, for instance, Alan, uh, before you leave  today, could you make sure to take a look at D's?  D's what?  D's nuts. 
[03:43:00]  It's fun.  That was a joke.  Unfortunately, the call was censored and it's just like, uh, and it's just like, uh,  it doesn't do much good to anybody.  Does it?  It's like, I really can't even use it.  I mean, I guess I could figure out where it came from and see if I can find, but this  is more work.  So then, uh, I said, I need talk radio.  I need you to give me something from this.  So then he gives me a bunch.  He's like, well, can the Simpsons prank phone calls work?  I was like, you know, I'm not going to say no, but if there's something there, give it  to me.  Doubtful.  Right.  Yeah.  So he gives me a whole CD full of just prank phone calls, you know, like where fucking Bart 
[03:43:30]  Simpson calls Mo up and, and, you know, Mo's reaction and stuff.  And it's just like, I mean, it's like, you're saying that what he's doing is he's kind of  trying to figure out what's the easiest answer and then give you a lot of it.  Right.  Do you think, is that your strategy?  Well, I mean, a lot of it, like maybe 10, but that's what I mean.  Like figure out, like, what's the easiest answer to the question?  And then as many examples as, you know, 20 minutes will do.  Yeah, exactly.  Is that right?  Well, I mean, I don't spend 20 minutes. 
[03:44:00]  I spend all the time I possibly can on it.  I'm just, I guess I'm just slow, but I, I, I do.  Do you think Troy's been unfair to you?  I mean, I think Troy's frustration is fair, but I, I think he's being unfair about how  he perceives my work ethic.  I mean, dude, you haven't, I mean, perceiving your work ethic, you haven't yet to deliver  anything I needed.  And it's been like three weeks.  Yeah.  But I'm still delivering you something, even if it is in your words, shit.  Did you use that word?  Yeah.  Okay.  But it's not really what I was looking for.  And I told you, I said, I need talk radio. 
[03:44:30]  I need airheads.  I gave you examples.  Eric gave you a couple examples.  So then he says to me, well, I can't find talk radio online.  Okay.  So you can't use it.  So Troy keeps bringing up this movie, talk radio, and you're going, what do you want  me to do?  I can't find it online.  What am I going to buy the DVD?  I'm an intern.  I don't make any money.  Well, uh, the streaming sites that I have used in the past, um, I just couldn't find it  on, on them.  On the streaming site.  Okay.  So I said, well, it might be on Netflix.  And if you can find it on Netflix, I have an account.  You would be willing to lend your login to him.  Yes.  Okay. 
[03:45:00]  That would make your life easier.  Cause you wouldn't have to subscribe to Netflix.  I told you that.  Right.  You did tell me that.  So he still has gotten me nothing from talk radio.  Was it on Netflix?  Uh, I didn't know.  I couldn't check.  Didn't give it the old checkeroo?  I didn't give it the old checkeroo.  Okay.  So then I walk into the studio over here yesterday and Sal's on the phone and I was just venting  my frustration.  And I'm like, Sal, just see if you can find talk radio online for free.  You know, and not, not have to, cause some of those make you install a certain plugin  or something to do it. 
[03:45:30]  Just see, like, I'm just saying, Hey, see if you can watch talk radio right now.  On that computer.  In five minutes, five minutes.  He found it on YouTube, on YouTube, the whole thing on YouTube.  Did you try that streaming site?  I know you said you were trying a few different stream.  The video, he's YouTube had all kinds of stuff streaming.  No, no.  Okay.  So the video he's referring to, and I know what video, cause I could see the video that  was playing when Troy was like, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Is that what he sounded like?  Well, he was very, he was appalled by the, by the fact that there was a video that had 
[03:46:00]  clips from, uh, talk radio playing on YouTube, but he couldn't, but I told him that is the  trailer and he wouldn't believe me that that three and a half minute video.  No, it wasn't.  He was, that was totally the trailer.  He was scrolling through the whole thing.  That was the trailer.  He was scrolling through the whole thing.  It was the trailer.  I know that was the trailer.  Here comes Sal.  Okay.  And the streaming sites that I did go to that, you know, I found talk radio when I click on  it, it said I need to install a Java plugin.  I don't think I'm supposed to do that.  Was it the trailer?  It was the whole thing.  It was the whole movie on YouTube. 
[03:46:30]  I recognized that video.  I knew, I know that video.  I saw it.  How long was the trailer that you watched or the video that you watched?  It was like whatever.  When you pulled it up?  I didn't check the time.  Approximately.  It's over an hour.  Okay, so 90 minutes maybe.  Yeah, I don't know.  That's a hell of a trailer, Alan.  No, I, like, I was looking at it.  That looked, it looked eerily similar to the, to the trailer I saw.  Well, you know what happens a lot of times with trailers?  Oh, yeah, they cut out video.  They'll actually take clips from the full length movie and then they'll, they'll put  it into the trailer.  Sometimes, if you like, it plays out, you'll realize what you're watching is actually the 
[03:47:00]  movie referenced by the trailer.  Yeah, but movies don't last three minutes and 50 seconds with a bunch of quick cuts.  And I actually, I told Sal, I said, Sal, can you just scroll through and just make sure  that it's the full movie?  And he was scrolling through it.  It was not three and a half minutes.  No, there's certain ways that things can get uploaded to, like, popular sites like YouTube  that they kind of code the name a little bit.  Sure, sure.  And stuff like that.  And I was just able to come across it.  What did you search?  There's certain ways of doing it.  Yeah, it's, it's...  You don't want to say, what is it, illegal? 
[03:47:30]  No, it's not illegal.  It's just, there's...  How did you find it?  It's no direct way.  You have to click through a lot of shit.  And usually you're clicking through things that look like fake download buttons and ads  and shit like that.  But you can always find it if you just keep on digging.  Right.  Like, if you want any album, you don't even need to torrent it.  So it takes, but it takes about five minutes.  Dude, it literally, I...  Chris out there and watched me do it.  Five minutes is even being generous.  Like, I think he probably did in about three.  Yeah, it was pretty quick.  Probably closer to three then?  I'd say three.  Wait, so you're using this archaic, weird method that I did?  Google, that's archaic.  No, it's called YouTube.  Well, no, but he's saying...  It is one of the original streaming sites, to be fair. 
[03:48:00]  It's somewhat archaic.  But it's also fairly modern in the sense that it's kind of updated with technology.  And it is the standard, I think.  I'm not as good...  I think it's the most popular.  Okay.  But no, his explanation right now just said you have to go click through things that  may look like they're spam.  Then you've got to kind of...  Right.  There's ways...  What the fuck?  I don't want to click through things that may look like spam.  I got you.  Alan's saying I'm more of an inside-the-box guy.  And you guys are attacking me with these outside-of-the-box methods. 
[03:48:30]  Give me something that can be explained in three simple steps on an instruction sheet.  That I can get done for you.  Right.  Is that right, Alan?  Well, I mean, I guess you can say it that way.  But what I'm saying is I'm not...  Like, my entire life I was pretty much trained just not to click on spammy-looking bullshit.  I mean, it's not your computer.  Who really gives a shit?  Is that how kids are raised now, Sal?  Spammy-looking bullshit.  From the time they're little babies, their moms trained them not to click on spam?  My parents always said, don't do that shit. 
[03:49:00]  Hey, my parents pretty much hammered that down to me because they were like, you were not  getting a virus on this computer.  How old was the first time that your parents told you never to click on spam?  I don't know.  Like, maybe six, seven?  Wow.  So it did.  It started at a young age.  I would like to add one thing to this.  They say it's taught in the home, but go on.  And I know Troy can attest to this, and I know you can, and Eric as well.  When you have to give instructions to Alan...  Alan Thicke, Jr.  Alan Thicke, Jr.  You have to be super, super explicit in the details of what you want, how he has to do it.  Well, he wants a simple three-step plan. 
[03:49:30]  Like, yeah.  Well, if you tell him, like, do this for me, like, he'll forget in the process in which  he goes from that moment in time and when he actually has to go do it.  So I always tell him, write this down because you're going to forget it.  I know you are.  So you gave him the business at this point, Troy?  I'm just frustrated.  I'm fucking frustrated.  It's like, dude, you're an intern.  You're showing up late.  You're half-assing everything.  Like, what the fuck, dude?  Did he make you feel bad?  Yeah, I felt pretty bad.  I don't want that to happen.  Dude, the fact of the matter is I like you as a person.  I think you're a cool guy.  But you just have no drive. 
[03:50:00]  You have no initiative.  And it's like...  Is that true?  That's not true.  To say I have no drive, no initiative is a complete fallacy.  That's not true.  I mean, dude, how many times have you shown up late?  So far this semester?  I don't know.  Tell me what proves that Troy is wrong.  Well, I mean, I do make an effort to always keep myself busy around here.  If I'm not doing anything, I always make sure to see if there's not someone on staff that needs me to do a project for him.  I take my time to... 
[03:50:30]  I mean, I've written you a couple of bits before.  I mean, a lot of them didn't get on the air or anything like that, but that's fine.  True.  Most of them are probably shit, but at least I'm trying.  But at least you're writing something.  Yeah, and then I show up on the weekends to help phone screen for your show.  And he does do a great job on Sundays.  And, I mean, like, I come here and I stay here as much as I possibly can because I want to get better.  I mean, the reason why I'm here is because I'm trying to train myself to be good enough for the workforce.  I knew when I came in here I wasn't going to be good.  That's why I'm here. 
[03:51:00]  I mean, listen, you can say what you want about Sal.  Everybody can say what he wants.  But anything we want.  No, but listen, when Sal was an intern, Sal took the initiative and figured out how to get shit done.  I will say that, to Sal's credit, as an intern, he was very resourceful and he took initiative.  He stopped doing that after he got hired.  But at that time...  When he was an intern, because he doesn't do that anymore.  Not so much anymore.  Not as much.  But it's not about Sal.  Why is this turning towards me? 
[03:51:30]  I'm saying it's not about...  I'm saying, for the record...  Can we just go back to Alan, please?  Yes.  All right.  Alan, maybe the problem is that you will put in the time, but you're not a very resourceful guy.  I guess not.  And I've said to him, dude, if someone's giving you a task and you need help with it, come to me.  I'll try to give you whatever help I can give you, right?  I've told you that numerous times.  I just don't like bothering people.  They say, you're here to intern.  We ask you to do work for us and help us out.  So if we want you to do the job correctly, ask us the detailed questions that you need to ask. 
[03:52:00]  I don't think, Junior, they say where there's a will, there's a way.  Right.  Not, well, I have to click spam, so I quit.  That's not a saying.  You know what I mean?  I'll get your Simpsons stuff instead.  Like, for instance, me.  I'm sitting here going, I'm going to make a career out of being a professional broadcaster, right?  Right.  Professional broadcasting doesn't exist anymore.  Nobody hires professional broadcasters.  They hire people who work at magazines, or websites, or actors, or musicians, or comedians, or somebody with some titties. 
[03:52:30]  Not professional broadcasters.  You know what happens?  I try out for the Raw Dog Morning Show, and what happens?  I go, oh, man, you sounded great.  I did like three shows.  You sounded great.  We don't have the budget for a morning show anymore.  Well, you could have told me that before you tried me out.  Oh, Entertainment Weekly.  You sounded great.  Except for one guy.  He doesn't really like your voice.  That's not going to happen.  WWE, you're perfect for us.  You're the right height.  You're the right size.  The hair doesn't work for us, though.  You know?  That's bullshit.  Do I sit here and say, well, I'm going to quit then? 
[03:53:00]  Or go to Troy and say, well, I'm just not able to get it done?  Have you ever heard me say that?  I'm just not going to be able to get it done.  I mean, I don't think I...  The answer is no.  The answer is no.  You know what I would have done if I were in your position?  And I'm not criticizing you.  I'm trying to teach you some lessons.  Go for it.  I would have...  If I...  When Troy said, I want clips from the movie, whatever, talk radio, I would have sat down  and found that movie. 
[03:53:30]  And if it's not on YouTube, which it is, but if it wasn't on YouTube, I would have signed  up for a free trial of Netflix and found it on Netflix.  And if it wasn't on Netflix, I would have found an illegal copy of it or gone and found  a $5 copy of it on DVD or something.  When I was an intern, Fast Times at Ridgemont High was on TBS.  You know what I did?  I went through that two hour...  I think it's two and a half hours on television.  I went through that entire movie and found every single time that they flubbed out a curse 
[03:54:00]  word and spent two days, hours...  I mean, Troy, you can understand how many hours this would have taken.  I watched...  First of all, I recorded the TV version in my own time, then digitized it, okay?  Then I took the real version of the DVD, right?  And then I went through every single curse word in the entire movie and matched it up  to what the movie did and what they did on television.  Why?  Just so I could come on ONA and say, look, I got a bit. 
[03:54:30]  And they played it.  I wasn't even in studio when they played it, but they played it.  I was like, yeah, look at me.  I'm the fucking man.  Would I go to that much effort now?  We'll see.  You know, that's a little more iffy.  But I'm saying I did it.  You're also in a different place than he is.  Now.  Now.  Then, no.  We were in the same place.  Yeah.  But you can't get from there to here without doing a little work.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  That's what separates interns from knights. 
[03:55:00]  That's how an intern goes from being an intern to being a British knight.  They do what the other interns won't do.  Troy, you've seen a lot of interns come through here.  Yeah.  None of them have done enough work to become a knight.  No.  When I was an intern, I was doing enough work to eventually, eight, nine years later, however  long it's goddamn been.  I've wasted my entire adult life here.  What about Sal?  Sal will never become a knight.  He didn't.  He looked like he was on his.  Don't even fucking try when you come asking me for advice later on.  Well, no.  I was asking him.  I'm trying to defend you, man. 
[03:55:30]  Don't take a fucking shot at me, Alan.  But he was.  He's curious.  He's curious.  He's curious.  Look, Troy, I thought people like you around here.  Like, I thought.  And the answer is.  That's a great question, Alan.  The answer is no.  The answer is that he was on a path to knighthood.  And then he decided that step two was enough steps for him.  He was going to stop that path, that he's good where he's at.  He got hired.  Yeah.  He got hired.  And he doesn't need to be a knight.  He's associate producer.  It's all good.  It's all gravy to him.  But this isn't about Sal.  This isn't about Sal, though.  You're welcome.  It's about Alan Thicke, Jr. 
[03:56:00]  You got hired.  I was like, what the?  That's the best compliment you can get as an intern.  We'll see.  No, it's not.  The best compliment you can get is not only are you hired, but you're still doing well.  And that's not a compliment Sal gets very often.  What?  I'm leaving here.  But, Alan, you're not even there yet.  You know what I mean?  I think Troy's in his own way trying to impart some wisdom to you.  Yeah.  You're not even close, unfortunately.  He's not.  How many days do you have left?  I don't know.  Maybe like a week and a half, two weeks.  That's not a lot of time, Alan.  And E-Rock mentioned to me that he may not be leaning towards a favorable review, which 
[03:56:30]  I disagree with.  He told me weeks ago that he wasn't going to write me a good review.  How could you tell him that weeks ago?  He still has weeks to go.  I said if he keeps it up, he's not going to get a good review.  Well, there was an issue last week, or maybe it was earlier this week, where Alan was in  the office and had said something a little bit negative.  Disrespectful?  Disrespectful to Sal and Roland.  What did he say to Sal and Roland?  What was it, Eric? 
[03:57:00]  What did you say?  What did I say?  Yeah.  Tell me.  Go ahead.  We can discuss this tomorrow.  I'm not cutting you off.  I bet we seriously do have to.  Okay.  Tell me what you said, and then we'll go.  I said that they would need to use a digging crane to make Eric's grave.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  That's very disrespectful.  We'll get into that tomorrow, I guess.  That's horrible, Eric.  I'm sorry that you had to hear that.  We'll get into that tomorrow, though, when this show continues.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez is coming up next. 
[03:57:30]  Goodbye, everybody. </pre>
